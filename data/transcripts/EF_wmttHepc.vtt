00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:13.400 align:start position:0%
there is not a local authority to do so
 
00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:15.560 align:start position:0%

members of the committee for the record
 
00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:19.480 align:start position:0%
my name is Paul paresi it's my privilege
 
00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:22.240 align:start position:0%
to serve as the State Fire Marshall I'm
 
00:09:25.829 --> 00:09:25.839 align:start position:0%
here today in support of Senate Bill 133
 
00:09:29.829 --> 00:09:29.839 align:start position:0%
section one uh which as Senator Carson
 
00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:32.920 align:start position:0%
uh stated it does allow us to issue uh
 
00:09:35.269 --> 00:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
us meaning State fir maral's office to
 
00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:37.240 align:start position:0%
issue a place of assembly licenses in
 
00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:40.040 align:start position:0%
the event that it's necessary to do so
 
00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:42.200 align:start position:0%
uh typically place of assembly licenses
 
00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:44.760 align:start position:0%
are issued by the local Authority having
 
00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:47.560 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction um uh for your edification
 
00:09:49.509 --> 00:09:49.519 align:start position:0%
places of assembly are rooms or spaces
 
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:52.720 align:start position:0%
where more than uh 100 people congregate
 
00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
or 50 or more if it's a tent um
 
00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:57.640 align:start position:0%
currently when the authority having
 
00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:00.200 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction uh when there is no
 
00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:01.880 align:start position:0%
Authority having jurisdiction such as
 
00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:04.440 align:start position:0%
places like green Grant or the summit of
 
00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
Mount Washington or dicksville Notch um
 
00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
and there is no Board of Selectmen
 
00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
available to uh issue a place of
 
00:10:15.069 --> 00:10:15.079 align:start position:0%
assembly um there needs to be somebody
 
00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
to be able to do that and currently no
 
00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:19.320 align:start position:0%
one can so uh we filed this legislation
 
00:10:21.269 --> 00:10:21.279 align:start position:0%
in the hopes that at least the the State
 
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:22.720 align:start position:0%
Fire Marshal's office would be able to
 
00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:26.600 align:start position:0%
do so and um and then also in
 
00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:28.680 align:start position:0%
consultation with us in the event that
 
00:10:30.389 --> 00:10:30.399 align:start position:0%
uh there a local Authority having
 
00:10:32.389 --> 00:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction uh there are times when
 
00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:34.240 align:start position:0%
it's more prudent for us to issue it
 
00:10:36.269 --> 00:10:36.279 align:start position:0%
than them so that's the purpose of the
 
00:10:38.389 --> 00:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
legislation I thank Senator KAS for
 
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
introducing it and thank you for
 
00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:41.160 align:start position:0%
allowing me to
 
00:10:47.069 --> 00:10:47.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:50.680 align:start position:0%
question thank you um Fire Marshall
 
00:10:53.829 --> 00:10:53.839 align:start position:0%
paresi how is this
 
00:10:55.629 --> 00:10:55.639 align:start position:0%
enforced thank you for the question
 
00:10:57.269 --> 00:10:57.279 align:start position:0%
representative it's typically enforced
 
00:10:58.509 --> 00:10:58.519 align:start position:0%
by the local Authority having
 
00:10:58.519 --> 00:10:59.829 align:start position:0%
by the local Authority having
jurisdiction

00:10:59.829 --> 00:10:59.839 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction
 
00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
um it is part of the state laww so the
 
00:11:05.069 --> 00:11:05.079 align:start position:0%
local Authority having jurisdiction
 
00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
would uh would make sure that it's
 
00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:10.160 align:start position:0%
enforced in in the event that um there
 
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
is no local Authority having
 
00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction than than we would but this
 
00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:16.040 align:start position:0%
would clean it up so that not only could
 
00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:17.480 align:start position:0%
we enforce it but we could also issue
 
00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:18.949 align:start position:0%
we enforce it but we could also issue
the

00:11:18.949 --> 00:11:18.959 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:11:22.629 --> 00:11:22.639 align:start position:0%

chair and members of the adna committee
 
00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
for the record I'm state senator Cindy
 
00:12:24.509 --> 00:12:24.519 align:start position:0%
Rosenwald from District 13 in nashwa and
 
00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:27.160 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to be here this morning to
 
00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:31.160 align:start position:0%
introduce part two of this bill which
 
00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
repeals the Emergency Medical Services
 
00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
Personnel lure interstate compact known
 
00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:39.269 align:start position:0%
Personnel lure interstate compact known
as

00:12:39.269 --> 00:12:39.279 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:12:42.629 --> 00:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
replica this was enacted several years
 
00:12:45.269 --> 00:12:45.279 align:start position:0%
ago in New Hampshire but has never been
 
00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:48.440 align:start position:0%
used and in fact the nearest state that
 
00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:53.000 align:start position:0%
has adopted the compact is at least 500
 
00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:57.320 align:start position:0%
miles away the compact would not enhance
 
00:13:00.069 --> 00:13:00.079 align:start position:0%
Public Safety because here in New
 
00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:03.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we already conformed to
 
00:13:06.829 --> 00:13:06.839 align:start position:0%
licensing and certification regulations
 
00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
from other distant
 
00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
States uh this this um action was
 
00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:15.560 align:start position:0%
included in Senate Bill
 
00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
540 of last year it um at the time
 
00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
passed the Senate on a Voice vote and
 
00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:26.680 align:start position:0%
then we included it in an Omnibus Bill
 
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
that unfortunately was veto
 
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:32.720 align:start position:0%
for other reasons I hope this committee
 
00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
will recommend it ought to pass as an
 
00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:39.160 align:start position:0%
idea that we tried but we weren't able
 
00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:47.560 align:start position:0%
chair okay thank you are there questions
 
00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:50.360 align:start position:0%

Roy thank you uh Madam chair thank you
 
00:13:59.670 --> 00:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
senator for taking my question question
 
00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
um you said that we enacted this several
 
00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
years ago but isn't it true that it was
 
00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
just last year during the middle of the
 
00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
pandemic that it actually uh got going
 
00:14:11.189 --> 00:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
because of the necessary committee
 
00:14:11.199 --> 00:14:12.430 align:start position:0%
because of the necessary committee
Staffing

00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:12.440 align:start position:0%
Staffing
 
00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:16.040 align:start position:0%
Etc I'm sorry I I wasn't able to hear
 
00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
this part of your question after but
 
00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:21.050 align:start position:0%
wasn't it also
 
00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:23.150 align:start position:0%
wasn't it also
[Music]

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:23.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
true isn't it also true um that you said
 
00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
the committee or this was enacted
 
00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
several years ago but isn't it true that
 
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
it really wasn't operating until last
 
00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:38.600 align:start position:0%
year during the middle of the pandemic
 
00:14:41.509 --> 00:14:41.519 align:start position:0%
due to it had to be staffed
 
00:14:45.269 --> 00:14:45.279 align:start position:0%
Etc I'm not aware of the Staffing thank
 
00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
you for the question but um my
 
00:14:51.829 --> 00:14:51.839 align:start position:0%
understanding is that it requires a
 
00:14:55.389 --> 00:14:55.399 align:start position:0%
number of states to enact
 
00:15:00.069 --> 00:15:00.079 align:start position:0%
it before it can become um
 
00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:05.000 align:start position:0%
enforced um I believe there are other
 
00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
people who can testified to the details
 
00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:09.189 align:start position:0%
people who can testified to the details
of

00:15:09.189 --> 00:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:12.920 align:start position:0%

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
chair thank you very much Mr Arnold
 
00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:16.120 align:start position:0%
you may be aware the past iterations of
 
00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:18.200 align:start position:0%
this committee have uh worked very
 
00:22:22.149 --> 00:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
carefully uh uh to try to uh remove the
 
00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:24.520 align:start position:0%
kinds of uh obstructions that you're
 
00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:27.480 align:start position:0%
referencing your testimony I'm wondering
 
00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
my first question is whether you or
 
00:22:32.909 --> 00:22:32.919 align:start position:0%
anyone from your off office offered this
 
00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
testimony before the senate in its uh
 
00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:40.600 align:start position:0%
negotiations and dealing with this
 
00:22:42.909 --> 00:22:42.919 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you representative Schmidt
 
00:22:45.549 --> 00:22:45.559 align:start position:0%
yes we did testify uh at the Senate
 
00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
hearing uh and submitted testimony to
 
00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:49.400 align:start position:0%
the executive departments and
 
00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:51.720 align:start position:0%
administration committee as well as the
 
00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
Senate finance committee uh
 
00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:56.200 align:start position:0%
understanding that military spouses need
 
00:22:58.470 --> 00:22:58.480 align:start position:0%
assistance now the department Advocates
 
00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:00.200 align:start position:0%
that states should pursue multiple
 
00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
approaches to reciprocity simultaneously
 
00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:05.080 align:start position:0%
including near-term actions to attain a
 
00:23:07.029 --> 00:23:07.039 align:start position:0%
baseline of getting military spouses a
 
00:23:09.789 --> 00:23:09.799 align:start position:0%
license within 30 days based on minimal
 
00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:12.360 align:start position:0%
documentation uh which are among the
 
00:23:14.269 --> 00:23:14.279 align:start position:0%
efforts that you referenced uh that have
 
00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:16.120 align:start position:0%
been previously been undertaken by this
 
00:23:18.909 --> 00:23:18.919 align:start position:0%
committee as well as long-term solutions
 
00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:21.240 align:start position:0%
for reciprocity through licensing
 
00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
compacts and indeed New Hampshire is a
 
00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
member of four Interstate licensing
 
00:23:28.909 --> 00:23:28.919 align:start position:0%
compacts including replica and should
 
00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:30.440 align:start position:0%
part five of this bill pass will be a
 
00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
member of six uh Interstate licensing
 
00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:35.200 align:start position:0%
compacts becoming one of only eight
 
00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:38.440 align:start position:0%
states uh to have have joined the uh six
 
00:23:41.269 --> 00:23:41.279 align:start position:0%
major Health licensing compact
 
00:23:44.029 --> 00:23:44.039 align:start position:0%
Frameworks so we absolutely salute all
 
00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:46.360 align:start position:0%
of your past uh efforts to support our
 
00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:48.440 align:start position:0%
service members and their families
 
00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:52.360 align:start position:0%
followup Madam chair followup thank you
 
00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
and will you or someone from your office
 
00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
be available I I believe we're going to
 
00:23:59.430 --> 00:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
have sub committees to deal with some of
 
00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:02.720 align:start position:0%
these issues uh would you or someone
 
00:24:04.789 --> 00:24:04.799 align:start position:0%
from your office be available to assist
 
00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:11.789 --> 00:24:11.799 align:start position:0%
effort Roger uh we would be happy to do
 
00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
so thank you thank you madam chair
 
00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:16.350 align:start position:0%
so thank you thank you madam chair
representative

00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:16.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:18.360 align:start position:0%
veroda thank
 
00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
you so in your own words can you
 
00:24:26.789 --> 00:24:26.799 align:start position:0%
um estimate the number
 
00:24:30.789 --> 00:24:30.799 align:start position:0%
of people or a number of service people
 
00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:33.080 align:start position:0%
this bill would removing this would
 
00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
affect what would be the impact in New
 
00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire on
 
00:24:41.029 --> 00:24:41.039 align:start position:0%
this Roger so there are two elements
 
00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:43.720 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about one would be uh
 
00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:46.200 align:start position:0%
you know persons operating in New
 
00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh under a compact license and
 
00:24:52.269 --> 00:24:52.279 align:start position:0%
uh as uh was mentioned earlier the
 
00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
compact was passed in
 
00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
2018 uh and there are steps that are
 
00:24:58.549 --> 00:24:58.559 align:start position:0%
taken in order to become a full-fledged
 
00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
member of the compact which I believe
 
00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
was completed last year so there's only
 
00:25:04.669 --> 00:25:04.679 align:start position:0%
one person operating under a compact
 
00:25:07.029 --> 00:25:07.039 align:start position:0%
license right now uh in the state of New
 
00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire however there are individuals
 
00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
who are domiciled in New Hampshire and
 
00:25:15.389 --> 00:25:15.399 align:start position:0%
involuntarily uh reside in other states
 
00:25:18.669 --> 00:25:18.679 align:start position:0%
as a result of being military spouses uh
 
00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
and in those compact States those
 
00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
individuals could stand to lose their
 
00:25:26.909 --> 00:25:26.919 align:start position:0%
eligibility uh to continue working uh
 
00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:29.240 align:start position:0%
were this compact to be
 
00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:31.640 align:start position:0%
repealed followup and how many people
 
00:25:34.549 --> 00:25:34.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:38.149 --> 00:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
category so the the what's known as the
 
00:25:40.669 --> 00:25:40.679 align:start position:0%
defense Manpower data center does not
 
00:25:44.029 --> 00:25:44.039 align:start position:0%
track Personnel in that uh fashion so it
 
00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:46.600 align:start position:0%
is it is a difficult question to answer
 
00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
but of the 5600 licensed EMS workers uh
 
00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:53.720 align:start position:0%
uh in new hampire uh you know at least
 
00:25:56.669 --> 00:25:56.679 align:start position:0%
some of them are are military
 
00:25:56.679 --> 00:26:00.830 align:start position:0%
some of them are are military
spouses

00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
so we don't have that
 
00:26:06.149 --> 00:26:06.159 align:start position:0%
information negative and there is a a
 
00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
national EMS coordinated database that
 
00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
is maintained uh by the compact so I'm
 
00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:14.360 align:start position:0%
sure when the folks from the compact
 
00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:16.760 align:start position:0%
testify uh they can answer more
 
00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
specifically as to how many persons
 
00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:21.080 align:start position:0%
practice under compact licenses on a
 
00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:23.640 align:start position:0%
given day but in terms of tracking uh
 
00:26:27.029 --> 00:26:27.039 align:start position:0%
you know home state lure out of state
 
00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:28.760 align:start position:0%
that that's not
 
00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:31.240 align:start position:0%
the level of the Department of defense's
 
00:26:33.789 --> 00:26:33.799 align:start position:0%
involvement no
 
00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
um thank
 
00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
you thank you are there other
 
00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:46.510 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:46.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:26:48.789 --> 00:26:48.799 align:start position:0%
Roy thank you madam chair thank you for
 
00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
00:26:53.549 --> 00:26:53.559 align:start position:0%
question um with regard to this light
 
00:26:56.549 --> 00:26:56.559 align:start position:0%
this this bill has several aspects it's
 
00:26:58.549 --> 00:26:58.559 align:start position:0%
got the dod1 and then just other people
 
00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
who wish to use compact licens here with
 
00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:03.240 align:start position:0%
regard to the dod portion of
 
00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:06.360 align:start position:0%
it we're talking about how many New
 
00:27:08.389 --> 00:27:08.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire people are using it in other
 
00:27:09.909 --> 00:27:09.919 align:start position:0%
states and how many people from other
 
00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:11.440 align:start position:0%
states are using it in New Hampshire but
 
00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
let's talk about
 
00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:16.600 align:start position:0%
bases um so if if the dod is grading
 
00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
bases on its um friendliness for a lack
 
00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:22.480 align:start position:0%
of a better term to military spouses in
 
00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:24.200 align:start position:0%
their ability to gain employment in the
 
00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
state and all things being equal say
 
00:27:30.389 --> 00:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
between Bur inton and P's Air Force Base
 
00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:33.240 align:start position:0%
and base closures are are discussed as
 
00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:36.200 align:start position:0%
part of that grading system would this
 
00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:40.640 align:start position:0%
potentially be a reason that a decision
 
00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
against PE might be
 
00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
made Roger representative thank you for
 
00:27:48.669 --> 00:27:48.679 align:start position:0%
the question I would refer uh everyone
 
00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:51.720 align:start position:0%
to the Air Force's uh strategic basing
 
00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
evaluation which is available on the uh
 
00:27:56.950 --> 00:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
Department of the Air Force website and
 
00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:00.320 align:start position:0%
as I indicated in my testimony the 2020
 
00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
ndaa uh codified what which what was
 
00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
already a voluntary practice by the
 
00:28:06.549 --> 00:28:06.559 align:start position:0%
department of the Air Force to release
 
00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:09.240 align:start position:0%
these annual basing scorecards in their
 
00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:12.200 align:start position:0%
methodology the Air Force evaluates nine
 
00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:15.200 align:start position:0%
occupations accounting cosmetology EMS

psychology teaching and uh other
 
00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:22.440 align:start position:0%
professions uh in as much as those are
 
00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:23.360 align:start position:0%
the professions that have been
 
00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
identified where the most military
 
00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:28.200 align:start position:0%
spouses uh are practicing so to the
 
00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
extent that in their 2019
 
00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:33.480 align:start position:0%
evaluation uh pce Air National Guard
 
00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
base was was green for EMS that rating
 
00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:38.720 align:start position:0%
would be negatively impacted by the
 
00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
133 um and I'm not sure if you're aware
 
00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:47.320 align:start position:0%
or able to comment on this do you have
 
00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:50.120 align:start position:0%
any idea of the economic impact to the
 
00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
to the state and the area in general if
 
00:28:56.389 --> 00:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:56.399 --> 00:28:59.710 align:start position:0%
 
close

00:28:59.710 --> 00:28:59.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:02.509 --> 00:29:02.519 align:start position:0%
sorry about that I had to uh unmute
 
00:29:05.789 --> 00:29:05.799 align:start position:0%
myself there so in in terms of uh you
 
00:29:08.269 --> 00:29:08.279 align:start position:0%
know base realignment en closure that's
 
00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:10.720 align:start position:0%
a four-letter word if you will and uh
 
00:29:13.149 --> 00:29:13.159 align:start position:0%
you know I can't speculate on what the
 
00:29:16.549 --> 00:29:16.559 align:start position:0%
impact of that uh might be but according
 
00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
to the office of uh local defense
 
00:29:21.549 --> 00:29:21.559 align:start position:0%
Community cooperation which evaluates uh
 
00:29:25.389 --> 00:29:25.399 align:start position:0%
defense spending uh on an annual basis
 
00:29:28.389 --> 00:29:28.399 align:start position:0%
uh the economic value of peace is
 
00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
approximately 3.1 billion dollars which
 
00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
is three and a half% of the state's
 
00:29:36.789 --> 00:29:36.799 align:start position:0%
gross domestic product uh and ranks 14th
 
00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:39.440 align:start position:0%
overall in the United States and it
 
00:29:42.509 --> 00:29:42.519 align:start position:0%

ndaa to release the basing scorecard so
 
00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:56.720 align:start position:0%

uh up north an addition uh uh to the air
 
00:30:03.389 --> 00:30:03.399 align:start position:0%

the service members who are assigned

throughout the granite state today I'm
 
00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
providing testimony and support of
 
00:31:53.909 --> 00:31:53.919 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 133 part two repealing the
 
00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
Emergency Medical Services Personnel
 
00:31:58.470 --> 00:31:58.480 align:start position:0%
lure interstate compact otherwise known
 
00:31:58.480 --> 00:31:59.310 align:start position:0%
lure interstate compact otherwise known
as

00:31:59.310 --> 00:31:59.320 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:02.360 align:start position:0%
replica Senate Bill 133 in its entirety
 
00:32:03.909 --> 00:32:03.919 align:start position:0%
provides a number of Occupational
 
00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
licensure bills that would potentially
 
00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
improve the delivery of services to the
 
00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:32:10.789 --> 00:32:10.799 align:start position:0%
taxpayer while we see the benefit in
 
00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
many of these licensure compacts not all
 
00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
licens or compacts are created equal
 
00:32:17.149 --> 00:32:17.159 align:start position:0%
part two of this bill will actually
 
00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
repeal a compact agreement that can be
 
00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:21.240 align:start position:0%
detrimental here in New Hampshire the
 
00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
Emergency Medical Services Personnel
 
00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
licensure interstate compact that is
 
00:32:27.389 --> 00:32:27.399 align:start position:0%
currently in place creates confus fusion
 
00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
in our current EMS system lowering the
 
00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
quality of care delivered and has the
 
00:32:33.509 --> 00:32:33.519 align:start position:0%
potential to weaken our state's
 
00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
economy the current model allows out
 
00:32:38.549 --> 00:32:38.559 align:start position:0%
of-state EMS Personnel to migrate into
 
00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire on a routine basis to
 
00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
provide medical care and to transport
 
00:32:45.149 --> 00:32:45.159 align:start position:0%
patients to out ofate hospitals drawing
 
00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:47.720 align:start position:0%
theer expanded medicaid dollars out of
 
00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
state currently there are no bordering
 
00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:52.240 align:start position:0%
states that participate in this compact
 
00:32:53.909 --> 00:32:53.919 align:start position:0%
which means that these Services would be
 
00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
be migrating in from well out of state
 
00:32:58.509 --> 00:32:58.519 align:start position:0%
working in New Hampshire intermittently
 
00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
not paying property taxes and creating a
 
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
loss of Revenue furthermore the replica
 
00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:05.480 align:start position:0%
model allows for circumvention of the
 
00:33:08.029 --> 00:33:08.039 align:start position:0%
emergency response models and mutual Aid
 
00:33:09.509 --> 00:33:09.519 align:start position:0%
agreements that have been proven to be
 
00:33:11.789 --> 00:33:11.799 align:start position:0%
successful throughout our state
 
00:33:13.669 --> 00:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
municipalities must continue to have the
 
00:33:15.629 --> 00:33:15.639 align:start position:0%
autonomy to oversee their individual
 
00:33:17.789 --> 00:33:17.799 align:start position:0%
Public Safety response based on their
 
00:33:20.509 --> 00:33:20.519 align:start position:0%
community's needs should the replica
 
00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:22.720 align:start position:0%
model be utilized it would create
 
00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
unnecessary confusion within our EMS
 
00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
system that could have a negative impact
 
00:33:30.029 --> 00:33:30.039 align:start position:0%
for the municipality the
 
00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:32.320 align:start position:0%
provider you may hear testimony today
 
00:33:34.509 --> 00:33:34.519 align:start position:0%
that replica is a valuable tool that can
 
00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
provide assistance in New Hampshire
 
00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
during a disaster or a pandemic when in
 
00:33:39.909 --> 00:33:39.919 align:start position:0%
fact the governor already has the
 
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
ability to access this assistance under
 
00:33:44.269 --> 00:33:44.279 align:start position:0%
the Emergency Management assistance
 
00:33:46.909 --> 00:33:46.919 align:start position:0%
compact at the federal level you may
 
00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
also hear that replica is law in 21
 
00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:51.440 align:start position:0%
other states all of these states are
 
00:33:53.389 --> 00:33:53.399 align:start position:0%
located in the Southern and Midwestern
 
00:33:55.509 --> 00:33:55.519 align:start position:0%
areas of our country where the EMS
 
00:33:57.750 --> 00:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
systems are Rural and Mutual a
 
00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:00.360 align:start position:0%
Agreements are far less robust than EMS
 
00:34:01.669 --> 00:34:01.679 align:start position:0%
systems in New
 
00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:03.960 align:start position:0%
England currently we are navigating the
 
00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
worst unplanned emergency and Global
 
00:34:07.870 --> 00:34:07.880 align:start position:0%
pandemic that we've ever seen without
 
00:34:10.589 --> 00:34:10.599 align:start position:0%
needing to utilize replica proving that
 
00:34:12.349 --> 00:34:12.359 align:start position:0%
this is a model that we simply do not
 
00:34:14.869 --> 00:34:14.879 align:start position:0%
need in our state instead we must
 
00:34:16.950 --> 00:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
continue to rely on best practices and
 
00:34:18.869 --> 00:34:18.879 align:start position:0%
proven methods that are effective here
 
00:34:20.829 --> 00:34:20.839 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire to deliver the best
 
00:34:22.589 --> 00:34:22.599 align:start position:0%
possible quality of emergency medical
 
00:34:25.149 --> 00:34:25.159 align:start position:0%
services to our citizens this bill
 
00:34:26.990 --> 00:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
passed the Senate last year and
 
00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it was vetoed in an
 
00:34:30.869 --> 00:34:30.879 align:start position:0%
Omnibus Bill at the end of the year we
 
00:34:32.430 --> 00:34:32.440 align:start position:0%
were pleased to see this bill pass the
 
00:34:34.349 --> 00:34:34.359 align:start position:0%
Senate once again this year with
 
00:34:36.669 --> 00:34:36.679 align:start position:0%
overwhelming support and we respectfully
 
00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
asked this committee to do the same by
 
00:34:41.950 --> 00:34:41.960 align:start position:0%
passing SB 133 part two I've submitted
 
00:34:43.470 --> 00:34:43.480 align:start position:0%
written testimony and I'm happy to
 
00:34:44.990 --> 00:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that the committee
 
00:34:46.589 --> 00:34:46.599 align:start position:0%
may have thank you for your
 
00:34:53.950 --> 00:34:53.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:57.790 --> 00:34:57.800 align:start position:0%
questions representative Roy
 
00:34:58.910 --> 00:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
taking my question could you put a
 
00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
little meat on the bones for me when you
 
00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:04.720 align:start position:0%
talk about
 
00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:07.960 align:start position:0%
um other uh States people coming in
 
00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
taking uh away Mutual Aid or or taking
 
00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
people to hospitals out of state if no
 
00:35:15.589 --> 00:35:15.599 align:start position:0%
bordering state is a part of this
 
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
compact can you explain how that would
 
00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:19.240 align:start position:0%
how that would be
 
00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:21.240 align:start position:0%
possible yes representative thank you
 
00:35:24.510 --> 00:35:24.520 align:start position:0%
for your question um So currently we
 
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
have mutual Aid agreements that are
 
00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:29.240 align:start position:0%
designed specifically based on the
 
00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
communities in need and uh what their
 
00:35:34.510 --> 00:35:34.520 align:start position:0%
needs are and these are typically put in
 
00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
place by department heads uh for EMS
 
00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:40.720 align:start position:0%
agencies and fire departments alike um
 
00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:42.520 align:start position:0%
what this does is it evaluates what the
 
00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:44.200 align:start position:0%
community's needs are and how to bring
 
00:35:47.109 --> 00:35:47.119 align:start position:0%
in those resources uh when our current
 
00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
resources are over taxed with no
 
00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:51.720 align:start position:0%
bordering state that participates in
 
00:35:55.109 --> 00:35:55.119 align:start position:0%
this compact what that means is um
 
00:35:58.670 --> 00:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
Services could bring in outof State uh
 
00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
individuals or Personnel from let's say
 
00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:04.640 align:start position:0%
uh Alabama or Kansas or Texas or one of
 
00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
the other participating states to come
 
00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
in and work in New Hampshire as a
 
00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
licensed EMS uh professional um and the
 
00:36:16.109 --> 00:36:16.119 align:start position:0%
gentleman that testified before me well
 
00:36:18.589 --> 00:36:18.599 align:start position:0%
he spoke to uh everyone having a
 
00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:21.720 align:start position:0%
National Registry uh emergency medical
 
00:36:23.829 --> 00:36:23.839 align:start position:0%
technicians license what they do not
 
00:36:27.109 --> 00:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
have is a New Hampshire provids license
 
00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:29.160 align:start position:0%
and so they are operating under their
 
00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:30.069 align:start position:0%
and so they are operating under their
home

00:36:30.069 --> 00:36:30.079 align:start position:0%
home
 
00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:33.160 align:start position:0%
States uh medical Direction and their
 
00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
home States scope of practice uh and
 
00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire we have a medical
 
00:36:40.069 --> 00:36:40.079 align:start position:0%
control board that establishes best
 
00:36:43.349 --> 00:36:43.359 align:start position:0%
practices for EMS within our state uh
 
00:36:45.829 --> 00:36:45.839 align:start position:0%
and when you bring in this Personnel
 
00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
from um out in the midwest or from
 
00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:52.440 align:start position:0%
Southern States uh they have no idea of
 
00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
how we operate our EMS system here in
 
00:36:57.109 --> 00:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh the waters get muddied
 
00:36:59.630 --> 00:36:59.640 align:start position:0%
uh and that there's no clarification on
 
00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:01.240 align:start position:0%
what the appropriate standard of care is
 
00:37:03.829 --> 00:37:03.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:06.309 --> 00:37:06.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you for I'm not sure
 
00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
that that addressed the question as far
 
00:37:11.069 --> 00:37:11.079 align:start position:0%
as um coming in from out of state and
 
00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:14.240 align:start position:0%
taking patients away but uh let me ask
 
00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:15.640 align:start position:0%
this isn't it true that under the
 
00:37:18.589 --> 00:37:18.599 align:start position:0%
compact rules that if someone from
 
00:37:20.309 --> 00:37:20.319 align:start position:0%
another state is here practicing on
 
00:37:22.109 --> 00:37:22.119 align:start position:0%
their license from another state they
 
00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:24.040 align:start position:0%
have to comport with massachusett uh
 
00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
excuse me New Hampshire New Hampshire
 
00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:27.109 align:start position:0%
excuse me New Hampshire New Hampshire
rules

00:37:27.109 --> 00:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
rules
 
00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
um under the practice isn't that part of
 
00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
it that whatever state you're in those
 
00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
are the rules that apply not the state
 
00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:35.480 align:start position:0%
you came
 
00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
from so uh I don't believe that's the
 
00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
case representative um the the way I
 
00:37:42.910 --> 00:37:42.920 align:start position:0%
understand it is the National Registry
 
00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:45.560 align:start position:0%
of emergency medical technicians uh
 
00:37:48.829 --> 00:37:48.839 align:start position:0%
establishes what the guidelines are to
 
00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:51.160 align:start position:0%
practice within other participating
 
00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:54.720 align:start position:0%
States and uh a member operates under
 
00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.109 align:start position:0%
 
thank

00:38:01.109 --> 00:38:01.119 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:38:03.309 --> 00:38:03.319 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:38:07.109 --> 00:38:07.119 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you madam chair Mr R uh
 
00:38:10.910 --> 00:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
how realistic is it uh that someone
 
00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:15.160 align:start position:0%
would be brought in from um Texas or the
 
00:38:19.589 --> 00:38:19.599 align:start position:0%
Midwest uh Midwest is a thousand miles
 
00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:24.520 align:start position:0%
away Texas is even further away um so
 
00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:27.240 align:start position:0%
what's the reality in situation you're
 
00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:28.349 align:start position:0%
what's the reality in situation you're
detailing

00:38:28.349 --> 00:38:28.359 align:start position:0%
detailing
 
00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
here um what the reality is
 
00:38:32.069 --> 00:38:32.079 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for your
 
00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:33.880 align:start position:0%
question uh to be honest with you I do
 
00:38:36.109 --> 00:38:36.119 align:start position:0%
not know but anecdotally speaking I can
 
00:38:39.870 --> 00:38:39.880 align:start position:0%
tell you that um this has been um
 
00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
marketed as a product that essentially
 
00:38:47.309 --> 00:38:47.319 align:start position:0%
will help in uh an unplanned emergency
 
00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
or a state of emergency uh or a global
 
00:38:51.710 --> 00:38:51.720 align:start position:0%
pandemic and it's something that we've
 
00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
not utilized it's something that's on
 
00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:56.240 align:start position:0%
the books um and again anecdotally
 
00:38:58.230 --> 00:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
speaking speaking you could have
 
00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:00.680 align:start position:0%
services that bring in out ofate
 
00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
Personnel um to come into state for a
 
00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
undetermined amount of time to help um
 
00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:10.280 align:start position:0%
with their Workforce and that money does
 
00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
not stay in state they're here for a
 
00:39:13.109 --> 00:39:13.119 align:start position:0%
short amount of time and then they turn
 
00:39:16.069 --> 00:39:16.079 align:start position:0%
around and they go home um so again
 
00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
anecdotally speaking it it certainly
 
00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
could happen I don't know that it's
 
00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:21.240 align:start position:0%
happened yet because again this is a law
 
00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
that's on the books that we just don't
 
00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:27.800 align:start position:0%
use followup Madam chair so if if the uh
 
00:39:29.349 --> 00:39:29.359 align:start position:0%
this we're going to have to resolve this
 
00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
and the subcommittee will uh be working
 
00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
on it uh will you be available uh to us
 
00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
or someone from your office to help us
 
00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh deal with this situation absolutely
 
00:39:42.990 --> 00:39:43.000 align:start position:0%
sir I can send you all um my contact
 
00:39:44.589 --> 00:39:44.599 align:start position:0%
information you can contact me at any
 
00:39:48.309 --> 00:39:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
you other questions representative
 
00:39:54.750 --> 00:39:54.760 align:start position:0%
Bailey thank you madam
 
00:39:57.309 --> 00:39:57.319 align:start position:0%
chair you have several times referred to
 
00:40:00.309 --> 00:40:00.319 align:start position:0%
an unplanned emergency which puzzles me
 
00:40:02.910 --> 00:40:02.920 align:start position:0%
somewhat could you give me an example of
 
00:40:05.069 --> 00:40:05.079 align:start position:0%
a planned
 
00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:07.000 align:start position:0%
emergency thank you for your question
 
00:40:10.309 --> 00:40:10.319 align:start position:0%
representative um to be truthful uh that
 
00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
was a direct quote that I took from uh
 
00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
testimony in opposition to this bill uh
 
00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:19.480 align:start position:0%
from the Senate hearings um so that was
 
00:40:24.309 --> 00:40:24.319 align:start position:0%
in the actual um notes from that hearing
 
00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:28.720 align:start position:0%
um so while that's one of the uh terms
 
00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
that is being used to oppose this bill
 
00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
uh I agree with you I don't necessarily
 
00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:34.640 align:start position:0%
know what that
 
00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
means thank you thank you other
 
00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr
 
00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:49.400 align:start position:0%

thank you for your time and allow me a
 
00:41:09.349 --> 00:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
few moments to speak uh as far as the
 
00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:11.720 align:start position:0%
EMS personal licensure interstate
 
00:41:13.950 --> 00:41:13.960 align:start position:0%
compact removing that tool from New
 
00:41:16.589 --> 00:41:16.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has yet uh from a tool that
 
00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:18.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has yet to benefit from uh
 
00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
would be would be a drastic measure the
 
00:41:23.109 --> 00:41:23.119 align:start position:0%
compact was declared fully operational
 
00:41:25.349 --> 00:41:25.359 align:start position:0%
in March of 2020 in response to the
 
00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
covid-19 p mic at this time there are 21
 
00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
states participating in the compact
 
00:41:32.910 --> 00:41:32.920 align:start position:0%
which is an increase of six additional
 
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
States since New Hampshire adopted it in
 
00:41:37.470 --> 00:41:37.480 align:start position:0%
July of 2018 to date this compact has
 
00:41:39.309 --> 00:41:39.319 align:start position:0%
not been reused within borders of New
 
00:41:41.109 --> 00:41:41.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and thus has produced no
 
00:41:42.670 --> 00:41:42.680 align:start position:0%
instances where it has been proven to
 
00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:45.880 align:start position:0%
show no benefit to Grant Staters on the
 
00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:48.280 align:start position:0%
contrary we have seen the compact used
 
00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
by New Hampshire EMS providers and other
 
00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:53.160 align:start position:0%
states most recently a fellow compact
 
00:41:55.150 --> 00:41:55.160 align:start position:0%
state Colorado called for a national
 
00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
assistance in battling wildfires within
 
00:41:59.390 --> 00:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
its borders the state of New Hampshire
 
00:42:01.309 --> 00:42:01.319 align:start position:0%
wild and firefighter team responded to
 
00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
this Cry for Help as part of this team a
 
00:42:06.309 --> 00:42:06.319 align:start position:0%
local fire chief was able to provide
 
00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
care for her teammates as well as
 
00:42:09.790 --> 00:42:09.800 align:start position:0%
residents of Colorado utilizing her
 
00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:12.800 align:start position:0%
privilege to practice care with no delay
 
00:42:15.349 --> 00:42:15.359 align:start position:0%
all because of the EMS compact if New
 
00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was not participating in the
 
00:42:18.829 --> 00:42:18.839 align:start position:0%
compact Chief Lund would have been would
 
00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:20.200 align:start position:0%
have not been able to provide care
 
00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:21.960 align:start position:0%
without delays of obtaining an emergency
 
00:42:24.109 --> 00:42:24.119 align:start position:0%
ler which could have put her team at
 
00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
risk if injured if injury occurred
 
00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
although New Hampshire has not directly
 
00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
benefited from the compact to repeal it
 
00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:33.240 align:start position:0%
and subsequently take this tool out of
 
00:42:36.670 --> 00:42:36.680 align:start position:0%
the Em's tool box is a step backwards
 
00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
this compact extends a privilege to
 
00:42:41.349 --> 00:42:41.359 align:start position:0%
practice to EMS providers only and does
 
00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
not bypass the requirements of
 
00:42:44.750 --> 00:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
departments and agencies wishing to
 
00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
provide EMS services in our state from
 
00:42:49.950 --> 00:42:49.960 align:start position:0%
being licensed as an EMS unit by the
 
00:42:53.549 --> 00:42:53.559 align:start position:0%
Bureau of VMS this compact simply allows
 
00:42:55.790 --> 00:42:55.800 align:start position:0%
a mechanism for for our appropriately
 
00:42:58.069 --> 00:42:58.079 align:start position:0%
licensed units to have access to
 
00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:00.160 align:start position:0%
additional Workforce If Ever
 
00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:02.720 align:start position:0%
Needed furthermore within the originally
 
00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
adopted language safeguards were placed
 
00:43:07.109 --> 00:43:07.119 align:start position:0%
disallowing the use of providers under
 
00:43:08.990 --> 00:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
this privilege of practice extended by
 
00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
the compact as regular and usual staff
 
00:43:17.710 --> 00:43:17.720 align:start position:0%
Personnel in the RSA 153 a20 section 26
 
00:43:21.549 --> 00:43:21.559 align:start position:0%
or sorry 24 spells this out enclosing
 
00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:23.640 align:start position:0%
the compact does not harm to does no
 
00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
harm to the residents or visitors of the
 
00:43:26.589 --> 00:43:26.599 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire
 
00:43:28.510 --> 00:43:28.520 align:start position:0%
the compact enables our
 
00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
5600 licensed EMS providers to be part
 
00:43:33.630 --> 00:43:33.640 align:start position:0%
of a 21 State initiative that extends a
 
00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:36.400 align:start position:0%
resource to one another this comes at a
 
00:43:37.710 --> 00:43:37.720 align:start position:0%
time where there is a national
 
00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:39.400 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and Retention problem to
 
00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:41.480 align:start position:0%
Public Safety as well as what we hope to
 
00:43:44.910 --> 00:43:44.920 align:start position:0%
be the curtails the largest pandemic in
 
00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:47.240 align:start position:0%
history in in regards to some of the
 
00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
other questions that were asked I want
 
00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:53.200 align:start position:0%
to make it clear that EMS services in
 
00:43:56.510 --> 00:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire are only to
 
00:44:00.549 --> 00:44:00.559 align:start position:0%
be provided by licensed EMS units and
 
00:44:03.589 --> 00:44:03.599 align:start position:0%
how those licensed EMS
 
00:44:06.670 --> 00:44:06.680 align:start position:0%
units provide that care is through
 
00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:09.200 align:start position:0%
licensed EMS
 
00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
providers so any use of the Compact and
 
00:44:18.190 --> 00:44:18.200 align:start position:0%
access to additional providers would
 
00:44:20.349 --> 00:44:20.359 align:start position:0%
still have to be done through a licensed
 
00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
EMS service so we're increasing a
 
00:44:27.069 --> 00:44:27.079 align:start position:0%
Workforce but we're not bypassing who is
 
00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:28.440 align:start position:0%

00:44:30.190 --> 00:44:30.200 align:start position:0%

purpose or in part the purpose uh of uh
 
00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
entering into this compact was to assist
 
00:45:43.790 --> 00:45:43.800 align:start position:0%
in the portability of uh licensure for

New Hampshire uh on Military orders
 
00:45:59.430 --> 00:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
repealing this act or this compact would
 
00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
adversely impact that population uh so
 
00:46:07.230 --> 00:46:07.240 align:start position:0%

00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:34.160 align:start position:0%

you representative Schmidt thank you
 
00:46:44.270 --> 00:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
madam chair Mr Perry it it has not yet
 
00:46:48.190 --> 00:46:48.200 align:start position:0%
been alluded to uh directly uh but tele
 
00:46:51.349 --> 00:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
medicine is an ever expanding
 
00:46:55.270 --> 00:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
phenomenon uh and an aspect of Modern
 
00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:57.190 align:start position:0%
phenomenon uh and an aspect of Modern
Health

00:46:57.190 --> 00:46:57.200 align:start position:0%
Health
 
00:47:01.390 --> 00:47:01.400 align:start position:0%
Services uh to what degree would that be
 
00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:05.680 align:start position:0%
impacted by uh this uh this part of the
 
00:47:10.270 --> 00:47:10.280 align:start position:0%
of the bill I I I I'm not an expert in
 
00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:12.640 align:start position:0%
emergency medical technicians or tele
 
00:47:15.829 --> 00:47:15.839 align:start position:0%
medicine I would make this assumption uh
 
00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:17.680 align:start position:0%
that it would not tele medicine would
 
00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
not impact this very much right because
 
00:47:22.670 --> 00:47:22.680 align:start position:0%
EMTs are generally First Responders who
 
00:47:25.829 --> 00:47:25.839 align:start position:0%
are generally on the scene for incidents
 
00:47:27.910 --> 00:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
so you know if I make the assumption
 
00:47:30.829 --> 00:47:30.839 align:start position:0%
that EMTs are responding to incidents
 
00:47:32.309 --> 00:47:32.319 align:start position:0%
then they have to do that in person that
 
00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
tele medicine would not be
 
00:47:35.870 --> 00:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
impacted thank
 
00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:43.950 --> 00:47:43.960 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none is there anyone
 
00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
else who wishes to testify on part
 
00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:54.720 align:start position:0%

Hampshire paramedical Association and

committee to strike um strike out
 
00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:33.640 align:start position:0%
removal of part two of the replica
 
00:48:36.670 --> 00:48:36.680 align:start position:0%
compact um a lot of what you have heard
 
00:48:39.790 --> 00:48:39.800 align:start position:0%
today um had I will not rehash on those
 
00:48:42.630 --> 00:48:42.640 align:start position:0%
were points that I was going to bring up
 
00:48:45.030 --> 00:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
that I would just like to touch on that
 
00:48:47.109 --> 00:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
I have submitted written testimony on
 
00:48:48.990 --> 00:48:49.000 align:start position:0%
behalf and I hope that you have your
 
00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
group has received that that the EMS
 
00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
compact is as Chief romanello stated is
 
00:48:59.349 --> 00:48:59.359 align:start position:0%
a tool for New Hampshire to utilize in
 
00:49:01.829 --> 00:49:01.839 align:start position:0%
the event of what was earlier called an
 
00:49:04.270 --> 00:49:04.280 align:start position:0%
unplanned emergency I would consider to
 
00:49:08.270 --> 00:49:08.280 align:start position:0%
be a natural disaster or crisis that are
 
00:49:11.109 --> 00:49:11.119 align:start position:0%
above and beyond what would normally or
 
00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
typically be seen this is a mutual Aid
 
00:49:17.230 --> 00:49:17.240 align:start position:0%
tool that can be utilized to bring in
 
00:49:20.789 --> 00:49:20.799 align:start position:0%
Personnel to assist with the delivery of
 
00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
prehosp healthc care in the state of New
 
00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire all compact members re uh
 
00:49:30.030 --> 00:49:30.040 align:start position:0%
required to be certified to the National
 
00:49:32.430 --> 00:49:32.440 align:start position:0%
Registry of EMT level therefore there is
 
00:49:35.230 --> 00:49:35.240 align:start position:0%
a base level of training and
 
00:49:38.069 --> 00:49:38.079 align:start position:0%
understanding of prehospital medicine
 
00:49:39.789 --> 00:49:39.799 align:start position:0%
there are nuances with New Hampshire's
 
00:49:44.190 --> 00:49:44.200 align:start position:0%
protocols however there is a great level
 
00:49:47.390 --> 00:49:47.400 align:start position:0%
and standard between all levels within
 
00:49:50.430 --> 00:49:50.440 align:start position:0%
the National Registry that being said
 
00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:53.200 align:start position:0%
this is a tool that can be utilized as
 
00:49:55.870 --> 00:49:55.880 align:start position:0%
necessary the specifically there is no
 
00:49:57.910 --> 00:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
freelancing allowed so individuals could
 
00:49:59.190 --> 00:49:59.200 align:start position:0%
not just come in on day-to-day
 
00:50:01.950 --> 00:50:01.960 align:start position:0%
operations or be utili or be used to
 
00:50:04.190 --> 00:50:04.200 align:start position:0%
fill scheduling shortfalls this would
 
00:50:06.190 --> 00:50:06.200 align:start position:0%
only be used in times of Crisis or
 
00:50:10.109 --> 00:50:10.119 align:start position:0%
Mutual Aid this can generate a force
 
00:50:12.789 --> 00:50:12.799 align:start position:0%
multiplication and will allow for
 
00:50:15.390 --> 00:50:15.400 align:start position:0%
greater protection and service to
 
00:50:17.309 --> 00:50:17.319 align:start position:0%
individuals in New Hampshire citizens of
 
00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in times of
 
00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:22.640 align:start position:0%
emergency I also do stand ready to

large member of the board of um
 
00:52:09.589 --> 00:52:09.599 align:start position:0%
replica so the the answer your question
 
00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:12.640 align:start position:0%
that is correct ma'am so as um as the
 
00:52:14.910 --> 00:52:14.920 align:start position:0%
state director for New Hampshire and
 
00:52:17.069 --> 00:52:17.079 align:start position:0%
representing New Hampshire on the the
 
00:52:21.109 --> 00:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
repa uh Council uh I also was asked to
 
00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
be uh represent the commission itself as
 
00:52:26.470 --> 00:52:26.480 align:start position:0%
a member of the board directors as a
 
00:52:30.910 --> 00:52:30.920 align:start position:0%
member at large correct thank you um and
 
00:52:33.270 --> 00:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
I believe the other question uh that was
 
00:52:36.630 --> 00:52:36.640 align:start position:0%
asked was um do our current emergency
 
00:52:42.390 --> 00:52:42.400 align:start position:0%
protocols uh allow for um uh Mutual Aid
 
00:52:44.430 --> 00:52:44.440 align:start position:0%
I believe that that's what was asked I
 
00:52:47.470 --> 00:52:47.480 align:start position:0%
apologize whether an emergency order
 
00:52:49.870 --> 00:52:49.880 align:start position:0%
called for Mutual Aid through the
 
00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
compact so it did not um we didn't we
 
00:52:56.230 --> 00:52:56.240 align:start position:0%
didn't see a need um we we were
 
00:52:58.549 --> 00:52:58.559 align:start position:0%
certainly thinking about uh you know the
 
00:53:01.390 --> 00:53:01.400 align:start position:0%
need if it did arise and we we could ask
 
00:53:04.870 --> 00:53:04.880 align:start position:0%
uh ask for assistance but again um you
 
00:53:07.309 --> 00:53:07.319 align:start position:0%
know because our the closest border
 
00:53:09.390 --> 00:53:09.400 align:start position:0%
state or closest state where we would
 
00:53:11.870 --> 00:53:11.880 align:start position:0%
get resources from would be Delaware um
 
00:53:14.349 --> 00:53:14.359 align:start position:0%
it certainly would would prove difficult
 
00:53:16.230 --> 00:53:16.240 align:start position:0%
um now that doesn't mean we you know
 
00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
other states uh couldn't have assisted
 
00:53:20.710 --> 00:53:20.720 align:start position:0%
but again the the emac request that the
 
00:53:22.390 --> 00:53:22.400 align:start position:0%
governor can ask for through Homeland
 
00:53:26.470 --> 00:53:26.480 align:start position:0%
Security would certainly satisfy that um
 
00:53:29.309 --> 00:53:29.319 align:start position:0%
and we also would have to pay respect to
 
00:53:30.789 --> 00:53:30.799 align:start position:0%
the the additional language in the
 
00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
rulemaking section of of the of the law
 
00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:35.200 align:start position:0%
that that we couldn't use it for
 
00:53:38.230 --> 00:53:38.240 align:start position:0%
day-to-day staff and so um would have to
 
00:53:40.390 --> 00:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
scri around that if if we were going to
 
00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
attempted to need to increase Workforce
 
00:53:45.309 --> 00:53:45.319 align:start position:0%
um in this pandemic or you know
 
00:53:47.109 --> 00:53:47.119 align:start position:0%
hopefully it doesn't happen again but if
 
00:53:50.150 --> 00:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:52.750 --> 00:53:52.760 align:start position:0%
future thank you are there other
 
00:53:55.829 --> 00:53:55.839 align:start position:0%
questions for Mr h shellberg our
 
00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:05.230 --> 00:54:05.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:07.109 --> 00:54:07.119 align:start position:0%
was good morning thank you for the
 
00:54:08.589 --> 00:54:08.599 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak with you today my
 
00:54:10.750 --> 00:54:10.760 align:start position:0%
name is Chris dwaz and I'm a lifelong
 
00:54:12.670 --> 00:54:12.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire resident I currently
 
00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:14.480 align:start position:0%
reside in Hollis and I'm the regional
 
00:54:16.309 --> 00:54:16.319 align:start position:0%
director of American Medical Response
 
00:54:18.870 --> 00:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's largest 911 provider
 
00:54:20.309 --> 00:54:20.319 align:start position:0%
I've been a paramedic a nationally
 
00:54:22.069 --> 00:54:22.079 align:start position:0%
registered paramedic for the last 35
 
00:54:25.150 --> 00:54:25.160 align:start position:0%
years uh full disclosure I think I'm the
 
00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
author of The unplanned National
 
00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
Emergency uh uh verbage I I believe that
 
00:54:32.710 --> 00:54:32.720 align:start position:0%
was in my testimony last time uh didn't
 
00:54:34.870 --> 00:54:34.880 align:start position:0%
think it would cause a Ruckus but I uh
 
00:54:37.349 --> 00:54:37.359 align:start position:0%
did say unplanned uh I oppose section
 
00:54:39.390 --> 00:54:39.400 align:start position:0%
two the repeal of the Emergency Medical
 
00:54:43.150 --> 00:54:43.160 align:start position:0%
Services lure compact um New Hampshire
 
00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's participation in the EMS
 
00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
compact solved the potential problem it
 
00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
created a specific and defined process
 
00:54:52.390 --> 00:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
for licensed qualified EMS staff to
 
00:54:54.390 --> 00:54:54.400 align:start position:0%
safely cross state borders when needed
 
00:54:55.789 --> 00:54:55.799 align:start position:0%
in the performance
 
00:54:57.670 --> 00:54:57.680 align:start position:0%
their duties without having to hold
 
00:55:00.150 --> 00:55:00.160 align:start position:0%
multiple state licenses New Hampshire
 
00:55:01.829 --> 00:55:01.839 align:start position:0%
actually participates in approximately
 
00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
43 interstate compacts and replica is
 
00:55:07.950 --> 00:55:07.960 align:start position:0%
similar in language and intent to all of
 
00:55:09.630 --> 00:55:09.640 align:start position:0%
the other lens or compacts that New
 
00:55:12.109 --> 00:55:12.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has chosen to participated in
 
00:55:13.870 --> 00:55:13.880 align:start position:0%
when New Hampshire became the 15th state
 
00:55:16.549 --> 00:55:16.559 align:start position:0%
to join replica in 2018 it was the
 
00:55:18.589 --> 00:55:18.599 align:start position:0%
result of a collaborative effort of
 
00:55:21.190 --> 00:55:21.200 align:start position:0%
numerous New Hampshire EMS stakeholders
 
00:55:23.349 --> 00:55:23.359 align:start position:0%
including the fire service commercial
 
00:55:25.109 --> 00:55:25.119 align:start position:0%
ambulance providers New Hampshire
 
00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:27.200 align:start position:0%
hospitals and many of the volunteer EMS
 
00:55:28.990 --> 00:55:29.000 align:start position:0%
community members were so lucky to have
 
00:55:32.029 --> 00:55:32.039 align:start position:0%
in our state now that the replica
 
00:55:34.390 --> 00:55:34.400 align:start position:0%
compact is fully operational there are
 
00:55:36.829 --> 00:55:36.839 align:start position:0%
currently 21 member states and another
 
00:55:38.750 --> 00:55:38.760 align:start position:0%
state will join on July 1st bringing
 
00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
that number to 22 a couple of quick
 
00:55:43.549 --> 00:55:43.559 align:start position:0%
facts about replica what it does or does
 
00:55:46.230 --> 00:55:46.240 align:start position:0%
not do it does not provide anyone with a
 
00:55:48.710 --> 00:55:48.720 align:start position:0%
multi-state license it does not create
 
00:55:51.430 --> 00:55:51.440 align:start position:0%
automatic licensed reciprocity it does
 
00:55:54.029 --> 00:55:54.039 align:start position:0%
not pertain to ambulances only licensed
 
00:55:56.390 --> 00:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
personnel it does not have authority
 
00:55:59.990 --> 00:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
over EMS or ambulance agency lure and it
 
00:56:01.870 --> 00:56:01.880 align:start position:0%
does not supersede the state of New
 
00:56:04.990 --> 00:56:05.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire EMS laws or rules it certainly
 
00:56:07.589 --> 00:56:07.599 align:start position:0%
does not allow for self-deployment and
 
00:56:10.309 --> 00:56:10.319 align:start position:0%
it does not allow for routine day-to-day
 
00:56:12.069 --> 00:56:12.079 align:start position:0%
operations or
 
00:56:14.670 --> 00:56:14.680 align:start position:0%
response it extends a privileged
 
00:56:16.789 --> 00:56:16.799 align:start position:0%
individual providers to practice in
 
00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
member states under authorized
 
00:56:21.549 --> 00:56:21.559 align:start position:0%
circumstances and only to qualified
 
00:56:24.990 --> 00:56:25.000 align:start position:0%
vetted licensed providers for specific
 
00:56:27.470 --> 00:56:27.480 align:start position:0%
purposes New Hampshire has actually used
 
00:56:29.750 --> 00:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
this compact as Chief Roman Ella
 
00:56:31.589 --> 00:56:31.599 align:start position:0%
mentioned when deploying local
 
00:56:34.710 --> 00:56:34.720 align:start position:0%
firefighters to wildfires in Colorado it
 
00:56:36.910 --> 00:56:36.920 align:start position:0%
also stands up a national coordinated
 
00:56:39.309 --> 00:56:39.319 align:start position:0%
Personnel database which allows the New
 
00:56:42.829 --> 00:56:42.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Bureau of EMS to view complete
 
00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:44.720 align:start position:0%
multi-state license history of
 
00:56:48.029 --> 00:56:48.039 align:start position:0%
individuals share real-time significant
 
00:56:51.069 --> 00:56:51.079 align:start position:0%
investigatory information share licensed
 
00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
discipline history and receive
 
00:56:55.029 --> 00:56:55.039 align:start position:0%
crossborder notifications about how to
 
00:56:56.910 --> 00:56:56.920 align:start position:0%
State adverse
 
00:56:59.589 --> 00:56:59.599 align:start position:0%
reactions notably as Mr honold and the
 
00:57:02.230 --> 00:57:02.240 align:start position:0%
other gentlemen from the dod mentioned
 
00:57:04.870 --> 00:57:04.880 align:start position:0%
it creates an ex expedited licensing
 
00:57:06.630 --> 00:57:06.640 align:start position:0%
process for the members of the military
 
00:57:09.230 --> 00:57:09.240 align:start position:0%
and their spouses separating from active
 
00:57:12.549 --> 00:57:12.559 align:start position:0%
duty as a recognized patriotic employer
 
00:57:14.950 --> 00:57:14.960 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire Garden Reserve we
 
00:57:16.630 --> 00:57:16.640 align:start position:0%
believe that this is a critical
 
00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
component that brings True Value to our
 
00:57:20.789 --> 00:57:20.799 align:start position:0%
employees who choose to serve this
 
00:57:23.270 --> 00:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
country the International Association of
 
00:57:25.630 --> 00:57:25.640 align:start position:0%
firefighters on its blog site which is
 
00:57:27.950 --> 00:57:27.960 align:start position:0%
dedicated to concerns about replica
 
00:57:30.750 --> 00:57:30.760 align:start position:0%
States a potential solution is to look
 
00:57:33.069 --> 00:57:33.079 align:start position:0%
at states such as Indiana which has
 
00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
adopted language to address the issues
 
00:57:39.589 --> 00:57:39.599 align:start position:0%
that the I has I completely agree if
 
00:57:41.309 --> 00:57:41.319 align:start position:0%
there are Corrections or improvements
 
00:57:43.630 --> 00:57:43.640 align:start position:0%
needed to make this compact better they
 
00:57:45.109 --> 00:57:45.119 align:start position:0%
should be done through an amendment
 
00:57:47.710 --> 00:57:47.720 align:start position:0%
process and not by fully repealing it
 
00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
starting from scratch and leaving New
 
00:57:51.390 --> 00:57:51.400 align:start position:0%

00:57:53.950 --> 00:57:53.960 align:start position:0%

00:59:24.990 --> 00:59:25.000 align:start position:0%
legislature would approve of the Ms
 
00:59:28.829 --> 00:59:28.839 align:start position:0%
compact in 2018 and then repeal it in in
 
00:59:31.710 --> 00:59:31.720 align:start position:0%
2021 basically multi-state compacts for
 
00:59:34.190 --> 00:59:34.200 align:start position:0%
healthcare professions are a good thing
 
00:59:36.029 --> 00:59:36.039 align:start position:0%
they benefit the public and they benefit
 
00:59:38.630 --> 00:59:38.640 align:start position:0%
the providers themselves as a registered
 
00:59:42.069 --> 00:59:42.079 align:start position:0%
nurse I benefit from the uh multi-state
 
00:59:44.430 --> 00:59:44.440 align:start position:0%
licensing compact uh that New Hampshire
 
00:59:46.670 --> 00:59:46.680 align:start position:0%
benefits from um and it's a good thing
 
00:59:49.549 --> 00:59:49.559 align:start position:0%
for for my professional colleagues uh as
 
00:59:52.710 --> 00:59:52.720 align:start position:0%
nurses um as well as the public who
 
00:59:55.710 --> 00:59:55.720 align:start position:0%
makes a uh uh a good use of travel
 
00:59:57.710 --> 00:59:57.720 align:start position:0%
nurses and things like that in in these
 
01:00:01.109 --> 01:00:01.119 align:start position:0%
days um so I guess is the is the EMS
 
01:00:04.069 --> 01:00:04.079 align:start position:0%
compact flawed well my understanding of
 
01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:06.720 align:start position:0%
the compact is no it is not flawed uh
 
01:00:09.190 --> 01:00:09.200 align:start position:0%
the language of RSA 153a and the
 
01:00:11.150 --> 01:00:11.160 align:start position:0%
administrative rules as well as the
 
01:00:13.190 --> 01:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
rules of the EMS compact governing board
 
01:00:16.349 --> 01:00:16.359 align:start position:0%
protect the public I have to say that
 
01:00:18.069 --> 01:00:18.079 align:start position:0%
the driving force behind the repeal
 
01:00:19.950 --> 01:00:19.960 align:start position:0%
effort is the International Association
 
01:00:22.510 --> 01:00:22.520 align:start position:0%
of firefighters which is an organization
 
01:00:25.630 --> 01:00:25.640 align:start position:0%
I have high regards for uh although I am
 
01:00:27.349 --> 01:00:27.359 align:start position:0%
not a member of that
 
01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
organization now the iff has determined
 
01:00:32.029 --> 01:00:32.039 align:start position:0%
that a multi-state compact may be
 
01:00:33.789 --> 01:00:33.799 align:start position:0%
harmful to its members they're doing
 
01:00:35.309 --> 01:00:35.319 align:start position:0%
their job they're advocating for their
 
01:00:38.430 --> 01:00:38.440 align:start position:0%
personnel I completely understand that
 
01:00:40.950 --> 01:00:40.960 align:start position:0%
the iaff position is to oppose adoption
 
01:00:42.430 --> 01:00:42.440 align:start position:0%
of the compact in states that are
 
01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
considering it and to repeal it in
 
01:00:46.950 --> 01:00:46.960 align:start position:0%
states where it currently
 
01:00:49.710 --> 01:00:49.720 align:start position:0%
exists again I I respectfully disagree
 
01:00:51.670 --> 01:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
with the Ia and their affiliate the
 
01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:52.960 align:start position:0%
professional firefighters of New
 
01:00:55.309 --> 01:00:55.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in this issue
 
01:00:56.950 --> 01:00:56.960 align:start position:0%
I would point out that the majority of
 
01:00:59.789 --> 01:00:59.799 align:start position:0%
the approximately 5600 EMS providers in
 
01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire are not represented by the
 
01:01:04.910 --> 01:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
pffnh and I would like to be a voice for
 
01:01:07.270 --> 01:01:07.280 align:start position:0%
the silent majority I would ask you to
 
01:01:08.829 --> 01:01:08.839 align:start position:0%
keep New Hampshire's membership in the
 
01:01:11.470 --> 01:01:11.480 align:start position:0%
EMS Compact and amend Senate Bill 133 to
 
01:01:14.109 --> 01:01:14.119 align:start position:0%
strike out section two otherwise I'm in
 
01:01:16.789 --> 01:01:16.799 align:start position:0%
favor of this Omnibus Bill and finally I
 
01:01:19.630 --> 01:01:19.640 align:start position:0%
would just like to um speak to Senator
 
01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:22.480 align:start position:0%
Rosen Wall's comment about the compact
 
01:01:25.710 --> 01:01:25.720 align:start position:0%
itself uh as far as a farthest distance
 
01:01:27.230 --> 01:01:27.240 align:start position:0%
or the closest distance of a current
 
01:01:30.589 --> 01:01:30.599 align:start position:0%
member being 500 miles a uh I'd like to
 
01:01:32.470 --> 01:01:32.480 align:start position:0%
point out that the physical therapy
 
01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
multi-state compact of which New
 
01:01:36.990 --> 01:01:37.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire benefits the closest uh the
 
01:01:38.670 --> 01:01:38.680 align:start position:0%
closest state that is also a member of
 
01:01:40.470 --> 01:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
that compact is in Virginia and they
 
01:01:42.589 --> 01:01:42.599 align:start position:0%
have 21 states the same as the EMS
 
01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
Compact and I'm fully supportive of the
 
01:01:47.829 --> 01:01:47.839 align:start position:0%
um effort by the Audiology and Speech
 
01:01:49.789 --> 01:01:49.799 align:start position:0%
Pathology and occupational therapy folks
 
01:01:53.029 --> 01:01:53.039 align:start position:0%
to get on board to their organizations
 
01:01:55.269 --> 01:01:55.279 align:start position:0%
um multi-state compa
 
01:01:57.589 --> 01:01:57.599 align:start position:0%
the both of those uh compacts have
 
01:01:59.710 --> 01:01:59.720 align:start position:0%
significantly less member States
 
01:02:01.549 --> 01:02:01.559 align:start position:0%

01:06:49.510 --> 01:06:49.520 align:start position:0%

01:07:03.109 --> 01:07:03.119 align:start position:0%
decisions regarding disciplinary actions
 
01:07:05.309 --> 01:07:05.319 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the board that Authority
 
01:07:07.630 --> 01:07:07.640 align:start position:0%
always remains with the board a quorum
 
01:07:09.150 --> 01:07:09.160 align:start position:0%
of the board must be present to
 
01:07:11.470 --> 01:07:11.480 align:start position:0%
adjudicate cases and all board members
 
01:07:13.230 --> 01:07:13.240 align:start position:0%
have the authority to ask questions of
 
01:07:15.710 --> 01:07:15.720 align:start position:0%
witnesses the presenting officer simply
 
01:07:18.309 --> 01:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
fa facilitates Communications much like
 
01:07:20.829 --> 01:07:20.839 align:start position:0%
the chair of a committee during last
 
01:07:22.950 --> 01:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
session um to answer representative
 
01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
shu's uh question
 
01:07:26.990 --> 01:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
we did um hear testimony regarding a
 
01:07:28.710 --> 01:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
similar bill that some nurses were
 
01:07:30.750 --> 01:07:30.760 align:start position:0%
concerned about a non- nurse presiding
 
01:07:33.670 --> 01:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
over a hearing um I do believe that
 
01:07:35.670 --> 01:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
those concerns are based on the mistaken
 
01:07:37.430 --> 01:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
belief that the presiding officer has
 
01:07:39.470 --> 01:07:39.480 align:start position:0%
authority over the outcome of the
 
01:07:41.589 --> 01:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
proceedings as noted the presiding
 
01:07:43.309 --> 01:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
officer has no more authority over the
 
01:07:44.870 --> 01:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
outcome of the proceedings than other
 
01:07:48.069 --> 01:07:48.079 align:start position:0%
board members oplc supports this bill as
 
01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
it brings the Board of Nursing in line
 
01:07:51.589 --> 01:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
with the other boards within oplc and
 
01:07:53.670 --> 01:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
permits all board members appointed by
 
01:07:55.029 --> 01:07:55.039 align:start position:0%
govern govern and Council to serve the
 
01:07:57.470 --> 01:07:57.480 align:start position:0%
state in this capacity I'm happy to
 
01:07:59.230 --> 01:07:59.240 align:start position:0%
answer any questions um that you may
 
01:08:00.390 --> 01:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
have and thank you for the opportunity
 
01:08:02.109 --> 01:08:02.119 align:start position:0%
to provide
 
01:08:09.990 --> 01:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:12.470 --> 01:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
questions just representative
 
01:08:15.470 --> 01:08:15.480 align:start position:0%
Schmid thank you madam chair uh good
 
01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
morning Lindsay uh so is it not the case
 
01:08:21.390 --> 01:08:21.400 align:start position:0%
that a number of the boards not only
 
01:08:24.749 --> 01:08:24.759 align:start position:0%
permit the public member to be uh the
 
01:08:27.789 --> 01:08:27.799 align:start position:0%
presiding officer but in in fact that
 
01:08:30.910 --> 01:08:30.920 align:start position:0%
it's a relatively common phenomenon for
 
01:08:33.349 --> 01:08:33.359 align:start position:0%
experienced public members to be the
 
01:08:36.669 --> 01:08:36.679 align:start position:0%
chair of the of their respective board
 
01:08:38.470 --> 01:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
that's absolutely correct representative
 
01:08:40.590 --> 01:08:40.600 align:start position:0%
and actually some board practice acts
 
01:08:42.990 --> 01:08:43.000 align:start position:0%
mandate that um public members do
 
01:08:45.829 --> 01:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
participate as uh the chair which is
 
01:08:47.510 --> 01:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
also typically the presiding officer
 
01:08:49.110 --> 01:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
board of psychology right now for
 
01:08:51.470 --> 01:08:51.480 align:start position:0%
example has their public member who
 
01:08:53.910 --> 01:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
happens to be an attorney as um the the
 
01:08:55.990 --> 01:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
chair and presenting officer I believe
 
01:08:59.390 --> 01:08:59.400 align:start position:0%
Real Estate Commission um has an acting
 
01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
public member um the board of mental
 
01:09:04.669 --> 01:09:04.679 align:start position:0%
health practice has um a a public member
 
01:09:07.630 --> 01:09:07.640 align:start position:0%
as the chair and presenting officer and
 
01:09:09.829 --> 01:09:09.839 align:start position:0%
I'm sure I can provide you with more
 
01:09:12.709 --> 01:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
examples thank you no I'm I'm I just
 
01:09:15.910 --> 01:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
wanted you to say representative
 
01:09:20.470 --> 01:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
Bara thank you Miss um Courtney is there
 
01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
um a history or an explanation as to why
 
01:09:25.590 --> 01:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
a member of the public would not have
 
01:09:28.630 --> 01:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
been allowed to participate in the past
 
01:09:31.189 --> 01:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
so I think it really stems from uh the
 
01:09:33.950 --> 01:09:33.960 align:start position:0%
notion that the presiding officer has
 
01:09:36.910 --> 01:09:36.920 align:start position:0%
the capability of rendering decisions on
 
01:09:39.430 --> 01:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
behalf of the board um and speaking with
 
01:09:41.149 --> 01:09:41.159 align:start position:0%
some of the nurses specifically the
 
01:09:43.229 --> 01:09:43.239 align:start position:0%
nursing association who had concerns
 
01:09:46.470 --> 01:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
about this bill last year my um there
 
01:09:48.470 --> 01:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
was concern that a not a person without
 
01:09:50.829 --> 01:09:50.839 align:start position:0%
clinical experience would preside over
 
01:09:53.110 --> 01:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
hearings my opinion is that that was
 
01:09:54.750 --> 01:09:54.760 align:start position:0%
based on the premise that the presiding
 
01:09:57.270 --> 01:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
officer has substantive authority over
 
01:09:58.750 --> 01:09:58.760 align:start position:0%
disciplinary matters and if that were
 
01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
the case I would completely agree um
 
01:10:02.390 --> 01:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
that it should be somebody with a
 
01:10:04.390 --> 01:10:04.400 align:start position:0%
nursing background but that's not the
 
01:10:07.590 --> 01:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
case um and so um but I think that's
 
01:10:11.390 --> 01:10:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:14.110 --> 01:10:14.120 align:start position:0%
lied representative
 
01:10:17.030 --> 01:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
Shu Madam chair good morning Miss
 
01:10:19.229 --> 01:10:19.239 align:start position:0%
Courtney uh can you tell us how many
 
01:10:22.390 --> 01:10:22.400 align:start position:0%
members serve on this particular board I
 
01:10:24.830 --> 01:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
believe it's 13 it's a fa large board
 
01:10:27.910 --> 01:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
we've got um two public members and then
 
01:10:30.830 --> 01:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
a host of uh individuals with a clinical
 
01:10:36.669 --> 01:10:36.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:39.750 --> 01:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
questions see none thank you very much
 
01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
01:10:45.270 --> 01:10:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:56.229 align:start position:0%
 
please

01:10:56.229 --> 01:10:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:58.990 --> 01:10:59.000 align:start position:0%
seeing none I will close the the hearing
 
01:11:02.830 --> 01:11:02.840 align:start position:0%
on part three move on to part four and I
 
01:11:05.870 --> 01:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
would call Senator
 
01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:09.590 align:start position:0%
would call Senator
Khan

01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:11.870 --> 01:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
here Madame chairman I don't believe
 
01:11:13.790 --> 01:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
Senator Khan is
 
01:11:18.950 --> 01:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
present ah but I I wonder was Senator
 
01:11:21.910 --> 01:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
Carson going to speak to all sections if
 
01:11:25.310 --> 01:11:25.320 align:start position:0%
needed or how was that
 
01:11:28.630 --> 01:11:28.640 align:start position:0%
I believe Senator Carson might be next
 
01:11:31.030 --> 01:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
best person if she's still with us she
 
01:11:33.590 --> 01:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
is in her hand is up
 
01:11:37.070 --> 01:11:37.080 align:start position:0%
excellent that case Senator please uh
 
01:11:44.870 --> 01:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:48.270 --> 01:11:48.280 align:start position:0%

01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:29.189 align:start position:0%
questions you have on the compacts but
these

01:15:29.189 --> 01:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:15:33.709 --> 01:15:33.719 align:start position:0%
are this is uh allowing us to expand our
 
01:15:37.070 --> 01:15:37.080 align:start position:0%
Workforce without having to expand uh
 
01:15:40.550 --> 01:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
regulatory component or uh create
 
01:15:42.669 --> 01:15:42.679 align:start position:0%
unnecessary speed bumps for people who
 
01:15:45.669 --> 01:15:45.679 align:start position:0%
want to uh bring services to New
 
01:15:47.910 --> 01:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so with that I'm happy to take
 
01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:50.430 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so with that I'm happy to take
any

01:15:50.430 --> 01:15:50.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:52.189 --> 01:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
questions any
 
01:15:52.199 --> 01:16:00.070 align:start position:0%
questions any
questions

01:16:00.070 --> 01:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:02.270 --> 01:16:02.280 align:start position:0%
repr right I can barely hear you
 
01:16:05.910 --> 01:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
representative Roy um Senator Sherman
 
01:16:11.030 --> 01:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing section six refers to active
 
01:16:14.790 --> 01:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
duty military personnel or their
 
01:16:18.470 --> 01:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
spouses um would that alleviate some of
 
01:16:22.070 --> 01:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
the concerns about uh repealing as in
 
01:16:29.669 --> 01:16:29.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:33.990 --> 01:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
uh I am I'm not really clear maybe you
 
01:16:36.149 --> 01:16:36.159 align:start position:0%
could help me with that
 
01:16:36.159 --> 01:16:39.030 align:start position:0%
could help me with that
question

01:16:39.030 --> 01:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:16:41.709 --> 01:16:41.719 align:start position:0%
there thank you there were concerns
 
01:16:44.830 --> 01:16:44.840 align:start position:0%
about um section
 
01:16:49.229 --> 01:16:49.239 align:start position:0%
two which repeals uh Emergency Medical
 
01:16:52.470 --> 01:16:52.480 align:start position:0%
Services Personnel licensure interstate
 
01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:54.310 align:start position:0%
Services Personnel licensure interstate
compact

01:16:54.310 --> 01:16:54.320 align:start position:0%
compact
 
01:16:58.990 --> 01:16:59.000 align:start position:0%
yes um section six
 
01:17:02.910 --> 01:17:02.920 align:start position:0%
of portion five I'm not sure how to how
 
01:17:06.790 --> 01:17:06.800 align:start position:0%
to you mean of of this compa of part
 
01:17:11.189 --> 01:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
five right uh refers to uh active duty
 
01:17:14.270 --> 01:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
military personnel or their SP or their
 
01:17:16.950 --> 01:17:16.960 align:start position:0%
spouses and I'm wondering if
 
01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
that section refers to uh
 
01:17:23.510 --> 01:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
emergency personnel
 
01:17:27.830 --> 01:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:31.709 --> 01:17:31.719 align:start position:0%
Personnel yeah I um I guess the the
 
01:17:33.709 --> 01:17:33.719 align:start position:0%
answer to a broader question there has
 
01:17:35.709 --> 01:17:35.719 align:start position:0%
really been no opposition to this
 
01:17:40.390 --> 01:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
bill um we worked with uh we I made sure
 
01:17:42.750 --> 01:17:42.760 align:start position:0%
that and I I believe the chair knows
 
01:17:47.070 --> 01:17:47.080 align:start position:0%
this as well the the boards have been u
 
01:17:50.270 --> 01:17:50.280 align:start position:0%
a part of the process as have the
 
01:17:54.229 --> 01:17:54.239 align:start position:0%
associations um but this does does allow
 
01:17:56.550 --> 01:17:56.560 align:start position:0%
the military component as well it does
 
01:17:57.830 --> 01:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
cover that
 
01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
so um I I I think it does answer some of
 
01:18:03.270 --> 01:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
the concerns that may have been
 
01:18:06.430 --> 01:18:06.440 align:start position:0%
expressed in part two of this Omnibus
 
01:18:10.669 --> 01:18:10.679 align:start position:0%
Bill uh but as you are probably aware
 
01:18:12.629 --> 01:18:12.639 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of the compacts in New
 
01:18:14.470 --> 01:18:14.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are working very well and
 
01:18:16.189 --> 01:18:16.199 align:start position:0%
achieving the goals that they originally
 
01:18:18.709 --> 01:18:18.719 align:start position:0%
set out which is to not increase the
 
01:18:21.510 --> 01:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
regulatory burden on providers who
 
01:18:24.990 --> 01:18:25.000 align:start position:0%
already are fully licensed and um
 
01:18:27.510 --> 01:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
regulated by another state that
 
01:18:30.709 --> 01:18:30.719 align:start position:0%
participates in the compact agreement so
 
01:18:34.470 --> 01:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
I guess one answer would be um not all
 
01:18:36.550 --> 01:18:36.560 align:start position:0%
compacts are the same and I think the
 
01:18:41.390 --> 01:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
EMS compact is a separate issue but this
 
01:18:44.510 --> 01:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
this compact really did come with uh all
 
01:18:47.470 --> 01:18:47.480 align:start position:0%
stakeholders involved uh in the process
 
01:18:50.470 --> 01:18:50.480 align:start position:0%
and with their
 
01:18:53.310 --> 01:18:53.320 align:start position:0%
support represent represent I'm sure
 
01:18:55.950 --> 01:18:55.960 align:start position:0%
it's a different compact I understand
 
01:18:57.669 --> 01:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
that but I'm wondering if it might
 
01:19:00.910 --> 01:19:00.920 align:start position:0%
impact some of the same people if if
 
01:19:03.669 --> 01:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
their professional licensure would
 
01:19:08.149 --> 01:19:08.159 align:start position:0%
extend uh in these areas um perhaps some
 
01:19:11.189 --> 01:19:11.199 align:start position:0%
of the uh other members some of the
 
01:19:14.510 --> 01:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
folks that testified on that our next
 
01:19:16.430 --> 01:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
witness is from the dod so perhaps he
 
01:19:18.270 --> 01:19:18.280 align:start position:0%
could touch on that any other questions
 
01:19:19.870 --> 01:19:19.880 align:start position:0%
for the
 
01:19:22.870 --> 01:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
senator representative zitech
 
01:19:25.910 --> 01:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
representative uh Senator Sherman this
 
01:19:29.550 --> 01:19:29.560 align:start position:0%
um this is maybe not to you directly
 
01:19:32.310 --> 01:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
this is more General general education
 
01:19:35.950 --> 01:19:35.960 align:start position:0%
for me and that's there is no emergency
 
01:19:39.790 --> 01:19:39.800 align:start position:0%
situation with involved in this part as
 
01:19:43.510 --> 01:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
opposed to say part Roman two if there's
 
01:19:45.790 --> 01:19:45.800 align:start position:0%
no emergency why can't we just use
 
01:19:50.270 --> 01:19:50.280 align:start position:0%
regular reciprocity why is a compact
 
01:19:52.629 --> 01:19:52.639 align:start position:0%
necessary that's that's a really good
 
01:19:54.310 --> 01:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
question question what is so what is the
 
01:19:57.510 --> 01:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
added benefit we don't have uh you know
 
01:20:00.070 --> 01:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
I'm a physician I'm licensed in New
 
01:20:02.550 --> 01:20:02.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh I have had to have licenses
 
01:20:06.189 --> 01:20:06.199 align:start position:0%
in every state that I've practiced um
 
01:20:09.950 --> 01:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
and um so there is really
 
01:20:14.310 --> 01:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
no reciprocity the beauty of a compact
 
01:20:18.950 --> 01:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
in nursing and this one is that it
 
01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:20.990 align:start position:0%
in nursing and this one is that it
formalizes

01:20:20.990 --> 01:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
formalizes
 
01:20:23.070 --> 01:20:23.080 align:start position:0%
reciprocity and where that really
 
01:20:27.430 --> 01:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
becomes important I think is in ensuring
 
01:20:31.070 --> 01:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
competency and also disciplinary action
 
01:20:33.390 --> 01:20:33.400 align:start position:0%
because that's the role of our boards is
 
01:20:37.229 --> 01:20:37.239 align:start position:0%
to make sure that as a physician I meet
 
01:20:39.310 --> 01:20:39.320 align:start position:0%
the the standards of Competency and then
 
01:20:42.390 --> 01:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
it also gives patients the ability to
 
01:20:44.070 --> 01:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
bring complaints or hospitals or
 
01:20:46.750 --> 01:20:46.760 align:start position:0%
otherwise to the Board of Medicine but
 
01:20:48.750 --> 01:20:48.760 align:start position:0%
in a nursing compact for example which
 
01:20:50.110 --> 01:20:50.120 align:start position:0%
we have in New
 
01:20:53.470 --> 01:20:53.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh you're held to the same
 
01:20:56.750 --> 01:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
standards but your your license is
 
01:20:59.229 --> 01:20:59.239 align:start position:0%
regulated elsewhere and and any
 
01:21:01.350 --> 01:21:01.360 align:start position:0%
complaints or concerns are typically
 
01:21:03.990 --> 01:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
handled where you are licensed but it's
 
01:21:05.070 --> 01:21:05.080 align:start position:0%
a super
 
01:21:07.470 --> 01:21:07.480 align:start position:0%
formal process
 
01:21:11.470 --> 01:21:11.480 align:start position:0%
so um a reciprocity agreement I don't
 
01:21:15.430 --> 01:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
know of any that actually exist in in
 
01:21:19.950 --> 01:21:19.960 align:start position:0%
health care um or in uh in areas that
 
01:21:24.390 --> 01:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
are regulated by state boards um because
 
01:21:27.830 --> 01:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
it's hard to make them formal enough to
 
01:21:31.709 --> 01:21:31.719 align:start position:0%
account for competency and uh ongoing
 
01:21:33.229 --> 01:21:33.239 align:start position:0%
monitoring of
 
01:21:35.750 --> 01:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
performance um and that's what a compact
 
01:21:38.709 --> 01:21:38.719 align:start position:0%
does it creates a formal mechanism for
 
01:21:40.350 --> 01:21:40.360 align:start position:0%
both of those to be addressed before
 
01:21:42.790 --> 01:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
someone can practice in the state
 
01:21:45.270 --> 01:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
whatever their profession
 
01:21:47.990 --> 01:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
is but you're correct by the way this
 
01:21:51.030 --> 01:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
does not have an emergency component but
 
01:21:53.149 --> 01:21:53.159 align:start position:0%
uh anybody in any of these these
 
01:21:54.709 --> 01:21:54.719 align:start position:0%
professions understands that New
 
01:21:56.709 --> 01:21:56.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is challenged by Workforce
 
01:21:59.870 --> 01:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
needs and so being able to bring people
 
01:22:01.510 --> 01:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
and you know we're a small state with
 
01:22:03.750 --> 01:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
three state borders being able to bring
 
01:22:05.669 --> 01:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
people from Maine or Vermont or
 
01:22:07.470 --> 01:22:07.480 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts having them doing
 
01:22:10.870 --> 01:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
crossborder work is not competition it
 
01:22:17.350 --> 01:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:19.790 --> 01:22:19.800 align:start position:0%
availability so Senator this is
 
01:22:23.510 --> 01:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
basically de facto uh
 
01:22:26.390 --> 01:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
reciprocity with the disciplinary if
 
01:22:28.189 --> 01:22:28.199 align:start position:0%
there were a disciplinary issue where
 
01:22:30.390 --> 01:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
would it be
 
01:22:34.910 --> 01:22:34.920 align:start position:0%
held uh it would be held uh based on um
 
01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:35.950 align:start position:0%
held uh it would be held uh based on um
you

01:22:35.950 --> 01:22:35.960 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:22:40.270 --> 01:22:40.280 align:start position:0%
know well my most of these comp compacts
 
01:22:44.590 --> 01:22:44.600 align:start position:0%
you are you any discipline is uh brought
 
01:22:48.470 --> 01:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
against your license so you would be
 
01:22:52.390 --> 01:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
regulated by the licensing State and and
 
01:22:54.030 --> 01:22:54.040 align:start position:0%
uh there will be people who will be
 
01:22:56.030 --> 01:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
testifying after me who are much more
 
01:23:00.830 --> 01:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
expert in specific uh this type of
 
01:23:03.229 --> 01:23:03.239 align:start position:0%
compact with this specific
 
01:23:05.910 --> 01:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
profession um which is you know
 
01:23:08.310 --> 01:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
Audiology and speech language
 
01:23:10.470 --> 01:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
pathology uh as well as occupational
 
01:23:14.470 --> 01:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
therapy these so I would defer a final
 
01:23:17.270 --> 01:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
answer to that uh to the people who
 
01:23:18.430 --> 01:23:18.440 align:start position:0%
brought this
 
01:23:20.590 --> 01:23:20.600 align:start position:0%
forward thank you Senator I think it's
 
01:23:22.110 --> 01:23:22.120 align:start position:0%
actually in the bill you need to read it
 
01:23:25.990 --> 01:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
more C thank you it is in the
 
01:23:29.030 --> 01:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you Senator um the chair
 
01:23:30.629 --> 01:23:30.639 align:start position:0%
recognizes Christopher Arnold from the
 
01:23:40.830 --> 01:23:40.840 align:start position:0%

New Hampshire have enacted either of
 
01:24:13.629 --> 01:24:13.639 align:start position:0%
these two compacts yet regardless New
 
01:24:15.270 --> 01:24:15.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire should be among the first to
 
01:24:17.709 --> 01:24:17.719 align:start position:0%
adopt these compacts Maine does have a

bill for the occupational therapist
 
01:24:21.830 --> 01:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
compact pending as the first lady said a
 
01:24:22.950 --> 01:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
few weeks ago
 
01:24:24.470 --> 01:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
helping military families with these
 
01:24:26.310 --> 01:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
issues is critical to our national
 
01:24:29.990 --> 01:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
security from 2011 to 2016 the
 
01:24:31.790 --> 01:24:31.800 align:start position:0%
department worked with all 50 states
 
01:24:33.629 --> 01:24:33.639 align:start position:0%
through common methods used by licensing
 
01:24:35.830 --> 01:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
boards to expedite the acceptance of a
 
01:24:38.070 --> 01:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
license from another state many states
 
01:24:40.669 --> 01:24:40.679 align:start position:0%
enacted some form of relief 39 States
 
01:24:42.669 --> 01:24:42.679 align:start position:0%
enacted laws for endorsement of a
 
01:24:44.910 --> 01:24:44.920 align:start position:0%
current license from another state 42
 
01:24:47.629 --> 01:24:47.639 align:start position:0%
States enacted laws for temporary lure
 
01:24:50.350 --> 01:24:50.360 align:start position:0%
and 31 States enacted laws for expedited
 
01:24:52.830 --> 01:24:52.840 align:start position:0%
application procedures however these
 
01:24:54.950 --> 01:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
methods proved insufficient to address
 
01:24:56.830 --> 01:24:56.840 align:start position:0%
the underlying concerns of military
 
01:24:59.590 --> 01:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
spouses further changes to lure to
 
01:25:01.669 --> 01:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
facilitate reciprocity and state lure
 
01:25:03.629 --> 01:25:03.639 align:start position:0%
programs for military spouses will
 
01:25:05.629 --> 01:25:05.639 align:start position:0%
continue to take time to cover all
 
01:25:08.030 --> 01:25:08.040 align:start position:0%
occupations in all states complicating
 
01:25:10.430 --> 01:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
matters further terms such as
 
01:25:13.109 --> 01:25:13.119 align:start position:0%
reciprocity and expedited are used
 
01:25:14.910 --> 01:25:14.920 align:start position:0%
differently among the states the
 
01:25:17.990 --> 01:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
department pivoted its approach in 2017
 
01:25:20.270 --> 01:25:20.280 align:start position:0%
to consider occupational lure compacts
 
01:25:21.830 --> 01:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
as another alternative to improve
 
01:25:24.030 --> 01:25:24.040 align:start position:0%
portability for military spouses
 
01:25:25.990 --> 01:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
compacts establish common understanding
 
01:25:28.030 --> 01:25:28.040 align:start position:0%
of Competency and its measurement within
 
01:25:29.870 --> 01:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
the occupation and then seek to have
 
01:25:31.270 --> 01:25:31.280 align:start position:0%
States approve the compact through
 
01:25:33.669 --> 01:25:33.679 align:start position:0%
legislation with this said all of these
 
01:25:35.550 --> 01:25:35.560 align:start position:0%
approaches can be beneficial if they
 
01:25:37.470 --> 01:25:37.480 align:start position:0%
produce a baseline result of having the
 
01:25:39.270 --> 01:25:39.280 align:start position:0%
military spouse be able to receive a
 
01:25:41.830 --> 01:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
license in approximately 30 days without
 
01:25:43.390 --> 01:25:43.400 align:start position:0%
submitting verifying documentation
 
01:25:45.030 --> 01:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
outside of verifying the standing of the
 
01:25:46.430 --> 01:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
license and fulfilling a background
 
01:25:49.109 --> 01:25:49.119 align:start position:0%
check DOD has assisted organizations
 
01:25:50.750 --> 01:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
representing occupations with obtaining
 
01:25:52.709 --> 01:25:52.719 align:start position:0%
State approval of their compacts where
 
01:25:54.070 --> 01:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
these compacts have benefit to the
 
01:25:56.149 --> 01:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
military these compacts cover
 
01:25:58.750 --> 01:25:58.760 align:start position:0%
approximately 40% of military spouses
 
01:26:01.709 --> 01:26:01.719 align:start position:0%
who need a license to work like replica
 
01:26:03.430 --> 01:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
these two compacts were designed to
 
01:26:04.990 --> 01:26:05.000 align:start position:0%
enhance the state's ability to protect
 
01:26:06.590 --> 01:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
the Public's health and safety
 
01:26:08.950 --> 01:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
especially client and patient safety
 
01:26:10.910 --> 01:26:10.920 align:start position:0%
these three compacts encourage the
 
01:26:12.669 --> 01:26:12.679 align:start position:0%
cooperation of compact states in the
 
01:26:15.189 --> 01:26:15.199 align:start position:0%
areas of EMS Audiology and speech

01:26:22.430 --> 01:26:22.440 align:start position:0%
facilitate the exchange of information
 
01:26:25.270 --> 01:26:25.280 align:start position:0%
between compact States regarding lure
 
01:26:28.270 --> 01:26:28.280 align:start position:0%
adverse actions and disciplinary history
 
01:26:30.390 --> 01:26:30.400 align:start position:0%
occupations are generally needed to
 
01:26:31.950 --> 01:26:31.960 align:start position:0%
establish a National Database of
 
01:26:34.229 --> 01:26:34.239 align:start position:0%
practitioners to operationalize the
 
01:26:36.669 --> 01:26:36.679 align:start position:0%
compact portability practices for
 
01:26:39.229 --> 01:26:39.239 align:start position:0%
example states in the EMS compact share
 
01:26:41.149 --> 01:26:41.159 align:start position:0%
a coordinated data system that enables
 
01:26:43.350 --> 01:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
them to share license history on EMS
 
01:26:45.629 --> 01:26:45.639 align:start position:0%
Personnel including license denials

investigatory histories this data system
 
01:26:51.750 --> 01:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
is anticipated to be fully populated by
 
01:26:53.990 --> 01:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
the end of 2021 and is a critical
 
01:26:55.470 --> 01:26:55.480 align:start position:0%
element for states to assure they are
 
01:26:57.270 --> 01:26:57.280 align:start position:0%
issuing licenses only to qualified
 
01:26:59.030 --> 01:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
Personnel who have no concerning
 
01:27:00.790 --> 01:27:00.800 align:start position:0%

01:27:02.629 --> 01:27:02.639 align:start position:0%
answer some of the earlier questions

serving out of States once that system
 
01:27:11.030 --> 01:27:11.040 align:start position:0%

compliance with the laws governing
 
01:27:16.430 --> 01:27:16.440 align:start position:0%
practice in each compact state finally

for occupational therapy the report

found that RSA 332 G sub7 requires
 
01:27:43.030 --> 01:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
boards to facilitate the issuance of
 
01:27:45.709 --> 01:27:45.719 align:start position:0%
licenses contingent upon the opinion of

the board as to whether a spouse's

ational therapy that certain spouses
 
01:27:56.910 --> 01:27:56.920 align:start position:0%
must apply for new lure uh as though
 
01:27:59.149 --> 01:27:59.159 align:start position:0%
they are a new applicant and that those
 
01:28:00.830 --> 01:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
who do hold active licenses in other
 
01:28:02.750 --> 01:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
states must submit verification of their
 
01:28:04.950 --> 01:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
previous licenses a time-consuming
 
01:28:07.070 --> 01:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
process that can take months the
 
01:28:08.870 --> 01:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
department Advocates that to achieve
 
01:28:10.750 --> 01:28:10.760 align:start position:0%
immediately attainable actions near-term
 
01:28:13.550 --> 01:28:13.560 align:start position:0%
actions and long-term solutions they be

near term while preparing for
 
01:28:21.430 --> 01:28:21.440 align:start position:0%
substantially improved portability in

the future as a result the department
 
01:28:25.870 --> 01:28:25.880 align:start position:0%
anticipates the cumulative impact of
 
01:28:28.189 --> 01:28:28.199 align:start position:0%
these processes should represent a more
 
01:28:30.830 --> 01:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
significant impact for example if
 
01:28:32.430 --> 01:28:32.440 align:start position:0%
processes that Implement statutory
 
01:28:34.430 --> 01:28:34.440 align:start position:0%

01:28:36.270 --> 01:28:36.280 align:start position:0%
place they will greatly enhance the

impact of further changes to policies
 
01:28:39.750 --> 01:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
that allow military spouses to obtain a

01:28:46.470 --> 01:28:46.480 align:start position:0%
initiatives get military spouses to work
 
01:28:48.470 --> 01:28:48.480 align:start position:0%

you representative
 
01:29:48.910 --> 01:29:48.920 align:start position:0%
Shu thank you Mr chair um thank you um
 
01:29:51.550 --> 01:29:51.560 align:start position:0%
sir I you probably heard my previous
 
01:29:51.560 --> 01:29:52.950 align:start position:0%
sir I you probably heard my previous
question

01:29:52.950 --> 01:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:29:54.669 --> 01:29:54.679 align:start position:0%
uh about whether
 
01:29:58.709 --> 01:29:58.719 align:start position:0%
this of the compact would alleviate some
 
01:30:02.350 --> 01:30:02.360 align:start position:0%
concerns for military uh personnel and
 
01:30:05.350 --> 01:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
their spouses reason for my uh thinking
 
01:30:07.990 --> 01:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
this is my particular
 
01:30:13.189 --> 01:30:13.199 align:start position:0%
town uh has uh EMS services but most of
 
01:30:16.550 --> 01:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
the employees there are part-time and I
 
01:30:19.310 --> 01:30:19.320 align:start position:0%
know of two of them in fact who work
 
01:30:22.550 --> 01:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
full-time as physical therapists so my
 
01:30:26.149 --> 01:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
thinking was that if you are involved in
 
01:30:29.149 --> 01:30:29.159 align:start position:0%
the medical professions you might tend
 
01:30:32.470 --> 01:30:32.480 align:start position:0%
to have those overlying capabilities do
 
01:30:36.189 --> 01:30:36.199 align:start position:0%
you know if uh any of the uh people who
 
01:30:40.990 --> 01:30:41.000 align:start position:0%
would be involved in EMS Services would
 
01:30:44.030 --> 01:30:44.040 align:start position:0%
also be physical therapists or apply
 
01:30:45.990 --> 01:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
under this
 
01:30:49.189 --> 01:30:49.199 align:start position:0%
compact so to the extent uh that a
 
01:30:52.310 --> 01:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
person may hold one or more professional
 
01:30:56.229 --> 01:30:56.239 align:start position:0%
licenses certainly if they are uh a
 
01:30:58.669 --> 01:30:58.679 align:start position:0%
physical therapist uh relocating from
 
01:31:00.550 --> 01:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
one compact state to another compact
 
01:31:03.030 --> 01:31:03.040 align:start position:0%
state uh that compact is of benefit to
 
01:31:05.430 --> 01:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
them however if they are also a
 
01:31:08.830 --> 01:31:08.840 align:start position:0%
paramedic or an EMT uh and they are
 
01:31:10.830 --> 01:31:10.840 align:start position:0%
relocating from a compact state to a
 
01:31:13.109 --> 01:31:13.119 align:start position:0%
non-compact state uh New Hampshire's
 
01:31:15.669 --> 01:31:15.679 align:start position:0%
leaving that compact would be highly
 
01:31:19.149 --> 01:31:19.159 align:start position:0%
detrimental uh to that individual uh I
 
01:31:21.950 --> 01:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
might add it would also uh to to speak
 
01:31:24.149 --> 01:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
the question about disciplinary uh
 
01:31:27.109 --> 01:31:27.119 align:start position:0%
actions be detrimental to the state in
 
01:31:30.030 --> 01:31:30.040 align:start position:0%
that repealing replica uh would mean the
 
01:31:31.990 --> 01:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
granite state gives up its ability to
 
01:31:34.350 --> 01:31:34.360 align:start position:0%
suspend or revoke an outof State EMS
 
01:31:36.070 --> 01:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
person's privilege to practice in New
 
01:31:38.310 --> 01:31:38.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh under that provision of the
 
01:31:40.510 --> 01:31:40.520 align:start position:0%
EMS compact New Hampshire has full
 
01:31:42.709 --> 01:31:42.719 align:start position:0%
control over its ability to suspend or
 
01:31:44.750 --> 01:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
revoke the privilege to practice of an
 
01:31:47.310 --> 01:31:47.320 align:start position:0%
outof State person functioning in New
 
01:31:49.229 --> 01:31:49.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire under the compact's privileged
 
01:31:51.510 --> 01:31:51.520 align:start position:0%
to practice uh if New Hampshire or any
 
01:31:53.510 --> 01:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
other State revokes a person's privilege
 
01:31:56.030 --> 01:31:56.040 align:start position:0%
to practice that person loses that same
 
01:31:58.470 --> 01:31:58.480 align:start position:0%
privilege in all other compact States in
 
01:32:00.310 --> 01:32:00.320 align:start position:0%
addition the home state that issued the
 
01:32:01.990 --> 01:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
person's license would agree to
 
01:32:03.870 --> 01:32:03.880 align:start position:0%
investigate whatever infraction led to
 
01:32:05.830 --> 01:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
the revocation of the privilege to
 
01:32:07.510 --> 01:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
practice as if it happened in the Home
 
01:32:09.950 --> 01:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
State uh accordingly a person could lose
 
01:32:11.350 --> 01:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
their home state license based on
 
01:32:13.030 --> 01:32:13.040 align:start position:0%
something they did out of state and
 
01:32:15.350 --> 01:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
similar protections are in place for
 
01:32:17.830 --> 01:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
both the occupational therapy Compact
 
01:32:19.629 --> 01:32:19.639 align:start position:0%
and the Audiology and speech language
 
01:32:23.669 --> 01:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
pathology compact contained in part
 
01:32:28.550 --> 01:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:31.510 --> 01:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:32:33.310 --> 01:32:33.320 align:start position:0%
Mr Arnold Tak my
 
01:32:36.830 --> 01:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
question did I I understand correctly in
 
01:32:40.229 --> 01:32:40.239 align:start position:0%
your testimony uh in the beginning that
 
01:32:43.830 --> 01:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
the uh Department of Defense was uh
 
01:32:46.550 --> 01:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
specifically looked at compact in
 
01:32:50.310 --> 01:32:50.320 align:start position:0%
starting compacts uh to alleviate um
 
01:32:52.790 --> 01:32:52.800 align:start position:0%
issues with uh mil Personnel who have
 
01:32:56.629 --> 01:32:56.639 align:start position:0%
been moved or looking to go to um uh be
 
01:32:58.390 --> 01:32:58.400 align:start position:0%
removed from
 
01:33:01.709 --> 01:33:01.719 align:start position:0%
service Roger so that that is correct
 
01:33:05.310 --> 01:33:05.320 align:start position:0%
and if you go back to uh the
 
01:33:08.750 --> 01:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
2019 National Defense authorization act
 
01:33:11.830 --> 01:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
there was in fact a requirement for the
 
01:33:14.430 --> 01:33:14.440 align:start position:0%
secretary to enter into a Cooperative
 
01:33:16.990 --> 01:33:17.000 align:start position:0%
agreement with the Council of state
 
01:33:18.950 --> 01:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
governments and their Center for
 
01:33:21.229 --> 01:33:21.239 align:start position:0%
interstate compacts for the development
 
01:33:24.950 --> 01:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
of new uh Interstate occupational lure
 
01:33:28.350 --> 01:33:28.360 align:start position:0%
Compact and uh in fact three weeks ago
 
01:33:30.629 --> 01:33:30.639 align:start position:0%
uh there was a press release from the
 
01:33:32.510 --> 01:33:32.520 align:start position:0%
secretary uh because there had been $5
 
01:33:34.950 --> 01:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
million to facilitate that process
 
01:33:38.350 --> 01:33:38.360 align:start position:0%
announcing uh five new occupations that
 
01:33:40.470 --> 01:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
had been selected to develop interstate
 
01:33:43.669 --> 01:33:43.679 align:start position:0%
compacts including teachers dentists and
 
01:33:43.679 --> 01:33:44.590 align:start position:0%
compacts including teachers dentists and
dental

01:33:44.590 --> 01:33:44.600 align:start position:0%
dental
 
01:33:46.669 --> 01:33:46.679 align:start position:0%
hygienists massage
 
01:33:49.030 --> 01:33:49.040 align:start position:0%
therapists uh
 
01:33:52.350 --> 01:33:52.360 align:start position:0%
cosmetologists so as you can see uh this
 
01:33:54.590 --> 01:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
has been sort of identified on our
 
01:33:58.070 --> 01:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
Continuum as the uh Optimum means for
 
01:34:00.950 --> 01:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
pursuing reciprocity that being said uh
 
01:34:02.790 --> 01:34:02.800 align:start position:0%
there is not a compact for every
 
01:34:05.910 --> 01:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
occupation uh nor is every state a
 
01:34:08.109 --> 01:34:08.119 align:start position:0%
member of each compact which is why we
 
01:34:10.550 --> 01:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
advocate for a variety of solutions
 
01:34:14.109 --> 01:34:14.119 align:start position:0%
simultaneously thank you follow up yes
 
01:34:15.990 --> 01:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
go ahead follow
 
01:34:20.629 --> 01:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
up would you be supportive of compacts
 
01:34:22.750 --> 01:34:22.760 align:start position:0%
being specifically for military
 
01:34:25.149 --> 01:34:25.159 align:start position:0%
personnel and spouses versus opening up
 
01:34:25.159 --> 01:34:30.189 align:start position:0%
personnel and spouses versus opening up
to

01:34:30.189 --> 01:34:30.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:34.990 --> 01:34:35.000 align:start position:0%
everyone Roger so to to the extent uh uh
 
01:34:38.310 --> 01:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
that the work goes into drafting a
 
01:34:41.189 --> 01:34:41.199 align:start position:0%
compact it brings together uh
 
01:34:44.510 --> 01:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
stakeholders from the occupation uh and
 
01:34:46.590 --> 01:34:46.600 align:start position:0%
the qualifications in the compact are
 
01:34:49.149 --> 01:34:49.159 align:start position:0%
defined by an Advisory Group and a
 
01:34:51.149 --> 01:34:51.159 align:start position:0%
drafting team composed of State policy
 
01:34:51.159 --> 01:34:52.109 align:start position:0%
drafting team composed of State policy
makers

01:34:52.109 --> 01:34:52.119 align:start position:0%
makers
 
01:34:54.790 --> 01:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
practitioners state board members uh to
 
01:34:56.950 --> 01:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
develop a balanced set of standards for
 
01:34:59.750 --> 01:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
portability that would apply to uh all
 
01:35:03.350 --> 01:35:03.360 align:start position:0%
practitioners so in terms of of getting
 
01:35:06.950 --> 01:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
that team together uh for drafting uh to
 
01:35:09.149 --> 01:35:09.159 align:start position:0%
focus on protecting Public Safety of
 
01:35:11.669 --> 01:35:11.679 align:start position:0%
consumers uh and appealing to the vast
 
01:35:13.830 --> 01:35:13.840 align:start position:0%
majority of states in order to be
 
01:35:16.910 --> 01:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
positively uh considered uh uh we would
 
01:35:19.830 --> 01:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
we would support the approach that uh uh
 
01:35:23.550 --> 01:35:23.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:25.550 --> 01:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
followup follow
 
01:35:28.750 --> 01:35:28.760 align:start position:0%
up so that being said it obviously would
 
01:35:30.669 --> 01:35:30.679 align:start position:0%
be the Professionals of the board that
 
01:35:34.629 --> 01:35:34.639 align:start position:0%
would be setting the standards for the
 
01:35:38.070 --> 01:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
compact would you be in favor of the
 
01:35:41.550 --> 01:35:41.560 align:start position:0%
compact solely being in place for those
 
01:35:43.350 --> 01:35:43.360 align:start position:0%
military individuals that we've talked
 
01:35:45.229 --> 01:35:45.239 align:start position:0%
about Department of Defense is looking
 
01:35:45.239 --> 01:35:48.950 align:start position:0%
about Department of Defense is looking
to

01:35:48.950 --> 01:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:50.990 --> 01:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
cover I'm sorry so I'm not sure if
 
01:35:54.109 --> 01:35:54.119 align:start position:0%
you're if you're referring to
 
01:35:57.070 --> 01:35:57.080 align:start position:0%
uh a compact that only applies to
 
01:35:59.350 --> 01:35:59.360 align:start position:0%
military personnel but we're talking not
 
01:36:02.390 --> 01:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
only about active duty uh uh service
 
01:36:05.550 --> 01:36:05.560 align:start position:0%
members but also uh their spouses
 
01:36:08.310 --> 01:36:08.320 align:start position:0%
recently uh separated veterans uh
 
01:36:12.390 --> 01:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
reservists and and and guards person as
 
01:36:14.550 --> 01:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
well that is correct and that's what I'm
 
01:36:17.030 --> 01:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
talking about covering all those
 
01:36:20.350 --> 01:36:20.360 align:start position:0%
individuals Roger and and compacts do uh
 
01:36:23.750 --> 01:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
which is why found them to be an optimal
 
01:36:27.030 --> 01:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
approach thank you thank you any further
 
01:36:30.229 --> 01:36:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:33.510 --> 01:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
Arnolds seeing none I will recognize
 
01:36:37.149 --> 01:36:37.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:40.669 --> 01:36:40.679 align:start position:0%
up uh yes I just wanted to address
 
01:36:43.830 --> 01:36:43.840 align:start position:0%
representative scc's question um I had
 
01:36:48.149 --> 01:36:48.159 align:start position:0%
to uh go back and into the bill and the
 
01:36:51.550 --> 01:36:51.560 align:start position:0%
way to think about this uh first of all
 
01:36:53.550 --> 01:36:53.560 align:start position:0%
um to think about this is that there is
 
01:36:56.750 --> 01:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
basically a home state and where the
 
01:36:59.430 --> 01:36:59.440 align:start position:0%
person is actually practicing or
 
01:37:03.310 --> 01:37:03.320 align:start position:0%
providing services and so in the state
 
01:37:04.709 --> 01:37:04.719 align:start position:0%
in which the person is providing
 
01:37:07.470 --> 01:37:07.480 align:start position:0%
Services that's while the person is
 
01:37:10.390 --> 01:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
providing Services they are subject to
 
01:37:13.709 --> 01:37:13.719 align:start position:0%
all and the way the bill reads the state
 
01:37:18.189 --> 01:37:18.199 align:start position:0%
laws do process um and all of the uh
 
01:37:20.750 --> 01:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
activity of the state's regulatory
 
01:37:20.760 --> 01:37:22.270 align:start position:0%
activity of the state's regulatory
Authority

01:37:22.270 --> 01:37:22.280 align:start position:0%
Authority
 
01:37:26.750 --> 01:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
so um and the action that that state may
 
01:37:29.629 --> 01:37:29.639 align:start position:0%
take if there is a a disciplinary
 
01:37:34.030 --> 01:37:34.040 align:start position:0%
concern is to revoke their um compact
 
01:37:37.430 --> 01:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
privilege in that state uh and then they
 
01:37:41.390 --> 01:37:41.400 align:start position:0%
also notify the home state so just to
 
01:37:44.669 --> 01:37:44.679 align:start position:0%
clarify the home state holds the license
 
01:37:48.990 --> 01:37:49.000 align:start position:0%
and could use action by another State's
 
01:37:51.709 --> 01:37:51.719 align:start position:0%
board um if they wanted to and to
 
01:37:53.229 --> 01:37:53.239 align:start position:0%
encumber the
 
01:37:56.669 --> 01:37:56.679 align:start position:0%
license um and when a license is
 
01:38:00.430 --> 01:38:00.440 align:start position:0%
adequately encumbered or um you know
 
01:38:04.229 --> 01:38:04.239 align:start position:0%
there's concerns the person can lose
 
01:38:07.390 --> 01:38:07.400 align:start position:0%
their compact privileges in other states
 
01:38:10.950 --> 01:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
until that license is cleared so I hope
 
01:38:12.870 --> 01:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
that answers representative scc's
 
01:38:15.750 --> 01:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
question where the disciplinary process
 
01:38:18.189 --> 01:38:18.199 align:start position:0%
lies so that's that's really good news
 
01:38:20.629 --> 01:38:20.639 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire because if you have
 
01:38:25.229 --> 01:38:25.239 align:start position:0%
somebody from a compact state uh then
 
01:38:27.390 --> 01:38:27.400 align:start position:0%
that person is practicing in New
 
01:38:29.550 --> 01:38:29.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and they are subject to the
 
01:38:31.950 --> 01:38:31.960 align:start position:0%
boards in New Hampshire for their
 
01:38:34.910 --> 01:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
compact privileges those boards cannot
 
01:38:38.109 --> 01:38:38.119 align:start position:0%
impact directly that person's license
 
01:38:40.830 --> 01:38:40.840 align:start position:0%
which is held in the home state but this
 
01:38:43.990 --> 01:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
has worked very well and just um briefly
 
01:38:46.350 --> 01:38:46.360 align:start position:0%
addressing representative gool's
 
01:38:49.070 --> 01:38:49.080 align:start position:0%
concerns these are all state boards they
 
01:38:53.070 --> 01:38:53.080 align:start position:0%
are non-military boards um that oversee
 
01:38:55.830 --> 01:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
this I would think it would be you know
 
01:38:57.910 --> 01:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
the goal here is to
 
01:39:02.350 --> 01:39:02.360 align:start position:0%
to um allow people to
 
01:39:05.149 --> 01:39:05.159 align:start position:0%
practice uh in multiple States whether
 
01:39:06.709 --> 01:39:06.719 align:start position:0%
they military or
 
01:39:09.510 --> 01:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
not without having to be encumbered by
 
01:39:12.390 --> 01:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
multiple licenses and it has been
 
01:39:15.669 --> 01:39:15.679 align:start position:0%
incredibly effective in the nursing
 
01:39:18.109 --> 01:39:18.119 align:start position:0%
boards and many of the compact
 
01:39:20.750 --> 01:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
Arrangements that we already have but it
 
01:39:22.990 --> 01:39:23.000 align:start position:0%
would be I would think it would be very
 
01:39:24.910 --> 01:39:24.920 align:start position:0%
difficult to do this for just for
 
01:39:28.350 --> 01:39:28.360 align:start position:0%
military because the boards are civilian
 
01:39:30.589 --> 01:39:30.599 align:start position:0%
boards that oversee all of these
 
01:39:35.910 --> 01:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
licenses um and I would urge you to uh
 
01:39:40.350 --> 01:39:40.360 align:start position:0%
approve this section section five um so
 
01:39:43.750 --> 01:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
that it can move forward and allow for
 
01:39:47.189 --> 01:39:47.199 align:start position:0%
um really an an increasing the reservoir
 
01:39:50.310 --> 01:39:50.320 align:start position:0%
of people who are available U to work in
 
01:39:53.070 --> 01:39:53.080 align:start position:0%

not the practi practitioner is

practicing here under a Hampshire issued
 
01:42:49.750 --> 01:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
license or a
 
01:42:52.390 --> 01:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
compact these compacts will allow

Mobility ensure standard standardized
 
01:43:11.870 --> 01:43:11.880 align:start position:0%
licensing requirements and the ability
 
01:43:14.189 --> 01:43:14.199 align:start position:0%
to investigate and take disciplinary
 
01:43:16.229 --> 01:43:16.239 align:start position:0%
actions against the privilege to
 
01:43:18.350 --> 01:43:18.360 align:start position:0%
practice when
 
01:43:21.430 --> 01:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
necessary when putting this
 
01:43:25.189 --> 01:43:25.199 align:start position:0%
um compact forward we cannot change the
 
01:43:27.350 --> 01:43:27.360 align:start position:0%
language of this compact because then we
 
01:43:29.030 --> 01:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
would not fit in with what the other
 
01:43:31.470 --> 01:43:31.480 align:start position:0%
states do and it just it wouldn't work
 
01:43:34.149 --> 01:43:34.159 align:start position:0%
to tweak the language of the compact to
 
01:43:36.830 --> 01:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
change it to just one type of person or
 
01:43:38.629 --> 01:43:38.639 align:start position:0%
somebody who might be in the military or
 
01:43:41.310 --> 01:43:41.320 align:start position:0%
somebody who's not this is designed to
 
01:43:43.990 --> 01:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
benefit all individuals who are
 
01:43:45.990 --> 01:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
occupational therapist occupational
 
01:43:48.550 --> 01:43:48.560 align:start position:0%
therapy assistants speech language
 
01:43:50.870 --> 01:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
pathologist audiologist anyone in in
 
01:43:50.880 --> 01:43:51.950 align:start position:0%
pathologist audiologist anyone in in
those

01:43:51.950 --> 01:43:51.960 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:43:54.270 --> 01:43:54.280 align:start position:0%
professions so with that said I'd be
 
01:43:56.910 --> 01:43:56.920 align:start position:0%
glad to take any questions you might
 
01:44:01.990 --> 01:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:05.070 --> 01:44:05.080 align:start position:0%
Maguire thank you Miss Kelly is
 
01:44:08.709 --> 01:44:08.719 align:start position:0%
it essentially the case that by joining
 
01:44:13.229 --> 01:44:13.239 align:start position:0%
a compact the board is is deciding that
 
01:44:17.030 --> 01:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
the comp the requirements for lure
 
01:44:19.350 --> 01:44:19.360 align:start position:0%
required by the compact states are
 
01:44:21.470 --> 01:44:21.480 align:start position:0%
equivalent to those of new
 
01:44:24.790 --> 01:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that is correct when a state
 
01:44:27.629 --> 01:44:27.639 align:start position:0%
adopts or um passes legislation to
 
01:44:31.430 --> 01:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
become part of the compact they're
 
01:44:34.470 --> 01:44:34.480 align:start position:0%
accepting Baseline requirements that
 
01:44:36.870 --> 01:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
would be a standardized education a
 
01:44:40.070 --> 01:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
standardized exam so that every state
 
01:44:43.109 --> 01:44:43.119 align:start position:0%
going into the compact has the
 
01:44:46.669 --> 01:44:46.679 align:start position:0%
same um requirements to become licensed
 
01:44:48.870 --> 01:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
and all the states are agreeing that
 
01:44:53.870 --> 01:44:53.880 align:start position:0%
that is where the initial um requirement
 
01:44:57.709 --> 01:44:57.719 align:start position:0%
should be for entry into the
 
01:45:01.310 --> 01:45:01.320 align:start position:0%
profession thank you representative
 
01:45:05.709 --> 01:45:05.719 align:start position:0%
fellows thank you um my question
 
01:45:09.709 --> 01:45:09.719 align:start position:0%
is the compact except for military
 
01:45:12.390 --> 01:45:12.400 align:start position:0%
personnel a person who moves from
 
01:45:16.229 --> 01:45:16.239 align:start position:0%
another state and is initially certified
 
01:45:19.910 --> 01:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
based on their home state license once
 
01:45:21.510 --> 01:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
they once they moved to New Hampshire
 
01:45:24.109 --> 01:45:24.119 align:start position:0%
and they're a resident here when it's
 
01:45:27.070 --> 01:45:27.080 align:start position:0%
time for renewal of
 
01:45:30.550 --> 01:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
their what was their home state they
 
01:45:33.750 --> 01:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
have to renew in New Hampshire can you
 
01:45:38.510 --> 01:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
tell me the length of um the license how
 
01:45:42.030 --> 01:45:42.040 align:start position:0%
how often do audiologists and speech
 
01:45:44.669 --> 01:45:44.679 align:start position:0%
pathologists have to renew in other
 
01:45:46.950 --> 01:45:46.960 align:start position:0%
states and also in New
 
01:45:50.109 --> 01:45:50.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire okay so states are different
 
01:45:51.870 --> 01:45:51.880 align:start position:0%
with where with their renewal but let me
 
01:45:53.589 --> 01:45:53.599 align:start position:0%
start at the beginning of
 
01:45:56.830 --> 01:45:56.840 align:start position:0%
that um what happens is is you have your
 
01:45:58.910 --> 01:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
home state you have your license there
 
01:46:00.629 --> 01:46:00.639 align:start position:0%
you get your privileges to practice in
 
01:46:03.310 --> 01:46:03.320 align:start position:0%
other states if you leave that home
 
01:46:06.430 --> 01:46:06.440 align:start position:0%
state you have to wherever you're living
 
01:46:09.510 --> 01:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
and whatever is your state you reside in
 
01:46:11.350 --> 01:46:11.360 align:start position:0%
you have to have a license there in
 
01:46:13.229 --> 01:46:13.239 align:start position:0%
order to have those privileges to
 
01:46:15.229 --> 01:46:15.239 align:start position:0%
practice so if you leave that home state
 
01:46:18.390 --> 01:46:18.400 align:start position:0%
you have to get another priv uh license
 
01:46:20.790 --> 01:46:20.800 align:start position:0%
and then re obtain your privilege to
 
01:46:23.189 --> 01:46:23.199 align:start position:0%
practice because you the compact doesn't
 
01:46:25.350 --> 01:46:25.360 align:start position:0%
know whether you'll move to a state that
 
01:46:27.350 --> 01:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
isn't part of the compact or is part of
 
01:46:30.589 --> 01:46:30.599 align:start position:0%
the compact so once you get that license
 
01:46:33.589 --> 01:46:33.599 align:start position:0%
in your state and you're the home state
 
01:46:36.070 --> 01:46:36.080 align:start position:0%
and you're going to renew you would
 
01:46:37.910 --> 01:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
renew based on theirs no matter what the
 
01:46:39.790 --> 01:46:39.800 align:start position:0%
other states do so in New Hampshire it's
 
01:46:43.070 --> 01:46:43.080 align:start position:0%
every two years so if the person is here
 
01:46:45.350 --> 01:46:45.360 align:start position:0%
and licensed here and getting privileges
 
01:46:47.510 --> 01:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
to practice from here they would still
 
01:46:49.669 --> 01:46:49.679 align:start position:0%
renew every two years in their New
 
01:46:51.629 --> 01:46:51.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire cycle
 
01:46:51.639 --> 01:46:54.310 align:start position:0%
Hampshire cycle
thank

01:46:54.310 --> 01:46:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:57.910 --> 01:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
you any other questions from Miss
 
01:47:00.950 --> 01:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
Kelly yes representative
 
01:47:04.950 --> 01:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
lakas um thank you uh Mr Vice chair what
 
01:47:07.750 --> 01:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering is uh how do the compact
 
01:47:10.350 --> 01:47:10.360 align:start position:0%
requirements for the various licenses
 
01:47:13.550 --> 01:47:13.560 align:start position:0%
compared to the existing ones uh in New
 
01:47:15.910 --> 01:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I mean are ours have do ours
 
01:47:18.310 --> 01:47:18.320 align:start position:0%
have less requirements more
 
01:47:20.830 --> 01:47:20.840 align:start position:0%
requirements how do they compare
 
01:47:23.950 --> 01:47:23.960 align:start position:0%
our requirements currently line up
 
01:47:26.350 --> 01:47:26.360 align:start position:0%
exactly with the requirements that are
 
01:47:27.430 --> 01:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
in this
 
01:47:29.870 --> 01:47:29.880 align:start position:0%
compact right thank
 
01:47:33.750 --> 01:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
you representative scitech so I'm kind
 
01:47:36.510 --> 01:47:36.520 align:start position:0%
of Johnny one note here except for what
 
01:47:38.790 --> 01:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
I heard earlier about people coming in
 
01:47:42.229 --> 01:47:42.239 align:start position:0%
on a freelance basis for occasional work
 
01:47:45.149 --> 01:47:45.159 align:start position:0%
with that exception this is super
 
01:47:49.229 --> 01:47:49.239 align:start position:0%
streamlined reciprocity is it not yes
 
01:47:51.669 --> 01:47:51.679 align:start position:0%
it's reciprocity while still uring one
 
01:47:53.870 --> 01:47:53.880 align:start position:0%
of the big components of having a
 
01:47:56.669 --> 01:47:56.679 align:start position:0%
compact is the ability that if somebody
 
01:47:59.149 --> 01:47:59.159 align:start position:0%
has a privilege to he practice here and
 
01:48:00.830 --> 01:48:00.840 align:start position:0%
they have a license in their home state
 
01:48:02.950 --> 01:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
and they were to do something here we
 
01:48:05.270 --> 01:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
could remove that privilege to practice
 
01:48:07.390 --> 01:48:07.400 align:start position:0%
but we can also work with the other
 
01:48:09.350 --> 01:48:09.360 align:start position:0%
state or States if they have more than
 
01:48:13.870 --> 01:48:13.880 align:start position:0%
one privilege to practice in any type of
 
01:48:18.229 --> 01:48:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:23.550 --> 01:48:23.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:26.790 --> 01:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
Pearson thank you Mr
 
01:48:30.270 --> 01:48:30.280 align:start position:0%
chairman ma'am it's uh so if I'm
 
01:48:31.830 --> 01:48:31.840 align:start position:0%
understanding you
 
01:48:34.510 --> 01:48:34.520 align:start position:0%
correctly in in in what you said about
 
01:48:36.510 --> 01:48:36.520 align:start position:0%
the changes and and how language cannot
 
01:48:38.229 --> 01:48:38.239 align:start position:0%
be tweaked if the state of New Hampshire
 
01:48:39.950 --> 01:48:39.960 align:start position:0%
had something a circumstance that was
 
01:48:44.550 --> 01:48:44.560 align:start position:0%
unique or some sort of um or some sort
 
01:48:47.030 --> 01:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
of situation where where the folks in
 
01:48:49.470 --> 01:48:49.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire thought this the standard
 
01:48:51.350 --> 01:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
should be
 
01:48:53.270 --> 01:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
a little bit more stringent or there was
 
01:48:55.629 --> 01:48:55.639 align:start position:0%
a or was a specific item to New
 
01:48:58.430 --> 01:48:58.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that we wanted to put in to
 
01:49:00.709 --> 01:49:00.719 align:start position:0%
those protocols would then we now be
 
01:49:03.709 --> 01:49:03.719 align:start position:0%
restricted because because we are part
 
01:49:05.750 --> 01:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
of this multi-state compact from being
 
01:49:07.149 --> 01:49:07.159 align:start position:0%
able to do
 
01:49:10.990 --> 01:49:11.000 align:start position:0%
so okay so once we if this legislation
 
01:49:13.870 --> 01:49:13.880 align:start position:0%
went through and New Hampshire decided
 
01:49:15.830 --> 01:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
that there was something that needed to
 
01:49:18.550 --> 01:49:18.560 align:start position:0%
be tweaked with the compact there's the
 
01:49:21.229 --> 01:49:21.239 align:start position:0%
compact Commission and New Hampshire has
 
01:49:22.750 --> 01:49:22.760 align:start position:0%
a seat on that
 
01:49:26.109 --> 01:49:26.119 align:start position:0%
commission and um you would take the pro
 
01:49:28.550 --> 01:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
the concerns there you would discuss it
 
01:49:31.070 --> 01:49:31.080 align:start position:0%
and as a group the group would decide
 
01:49:33.189 --> 01:49:33.199 align:start position:0%
whether or not that would be something
 
01:49:36.070 --> 01:49:36.080 align:start position:0%
that needed to be changed if New
 
01:49:38.109 --> 01:49:38.119 align:start position:0%
Hamshire felt strongly enough that you
 
01:49:40.109 --> 01:49:40.119 align:start position:0%
know whatever it was was not protecting
 
01:49:42.229 --> 01:49:42.239 align:start position:0%
our citizens we'd have to go back and
 
01:49:46.629 --> 01:49:46.639 align:start position:0%
repeal the Compact and
 
01:49:49.189 --> 01:49:49.199 align:start position:0%
um but so your short your short answer
 
01:49:52.470 --> 01:49:52.480 align:start position:0%
is no we would not be able to do that
 
01:49:55.070 --> 01:49:55.080 align:start position:0%
that's that's correct but one of the
 
01:49:57.109 --> 01:49:57.119 align:start position:0%
things on getting in on the ground floor
 
01:49:59.910 --> 01:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
of these compacts when they're in their
 
01:50:02.589 --> 01:50:02.599 align:start position:0%
formation stage New Hampshire would have
 
01:50:05.669 --> 01:50:05.679 align:start position:0%
a seat at that table in forming the
 
01:50:05.679 --> 01:50:10.390 align:start position:0%
a seat at that table in forming the
compact

01:50:10.390 --> 01:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:19.030 --> 01:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:19.040 --> 01:50:20.709 align:start position:0%
 
groa

01:50:20.709 --> 01:50:20.719 align:start position:0%
groa
 
01:50:22.990 --> 01:50:23.000 align:start position:0%
represent G you're
 
01:50:26.430 --> 01:50:26.440 align:start position:0%
muted thank you Miss Kelly we do have
 
01:50:28.350 --> 01:50:28.360 align:start position:0%
reciprocity with other
 
01:50:31.709 --> 01:50:31.719 align:start position:0%
states with with other professions and
 
01:50:33.149 --> 01:50:33.159 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:50:36.550 --> 01:50:36.560 align:start position:0%
compacts as well with other states we're
 
01:50:39.950 --> 01:50:39.960 align:start position:0%
part of compacts is that correct that is
 
01:50:43.109 --> 01:50:43.119 align:start position:0%
correct and why would we choose one over
 
01:50:43.119 --> 01:50:44.149 align:start position:0%
correct and why would we choose one over
the

01:50:44.149 --> 01:50:44.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:50:48.390 --> 01:50:48.400 align:start position:0%
other as far as reciprocity or a compact
 
01:50:52.310 --> 01:50:52.320 align:start position:0%
correct so it's very difficult with
 
01:50:56.629 --> 01:50:56.639 align:start position:0%
reciprocity to determine um sometimes
 
01:50:59.390 --> 01:50:59.400 align:start position:0%
whether or not some standards rise to
 
01:51:01.629 --> 01:51:01.639 align:start position:0%
the same standards as in New Hampshire
 
01:51:03.589 --> 01:51:03.599 align:start position:0%
and it's very timec consuming to go
 
01:51:06.470 --> 01:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
through every state to make that
 
01:51:08.310 --> 01:51:08.320 align:start position:0%
determination and then even though
 
01:51:10.229 --> 01:51:10.239 align:start position:0%
you've made that determination a state
 
01:51:14.189 --> 01:51:14.199 align:start position:0%
can just change something which may take
 
01:51:15.950 --> 01:51:15.960 align:start position:0%
them out of alignment with what New
 
01:51:19.030 --> 01:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does with a compact you're all
 
01:51:21.910 --> 01:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
in agreement you're dra in it together
 
01:51:25.229 --> 01:51:25.239 align:start position:0%
so you don't have to worry that
 
01:51:28.109 --> 01:51:28.119 align:start position:0%
tomorrow um another state will change
 
01:51:30.709 --> 01:51:30.719 align:start position:0%
their requirements and possibly have
 
01:51:34.109 --> 01:51:34.119 align:start position:0%
somebody who's not qualified come into
 
01:51:36.470 --> 01:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
the state in
 
01:51:40.430 --> 01:51:40.440 align:start position:0%
practice follow up follow up thank you
 
01:51:45.069 --> 01:51:45.079 align:start position:0%
how is um so this discussion on comp who
 
01:51:48.709 --> 01:51:48.719 align:start position:0%
supervises how um people who are coming
 
01:51:52.709 --> 01:51:52.719 align:start position:0%
into the state under to this compact are
 
01:51:52.719 --> 01:51:55.510 align:start position:0%
into the state under to this compact are
actually

01:51:55.510 --> 01:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:51:58.069 --> 01:51:58.079 align:start position:0%
um Let me let me rephrase that could I
 
01:52:00.910 --> 01:52:00.920 align:start position:0%
rephrase the question um does this
 
01:52:06.030 --> 01:52:06.040 align:start position:0%
compact therefore replace the function
 
01:52:06.040 --> 01:52:06.870 align:start position:0%
compact therefore replace the function
of

01:52:06.870 --> 01:52:06.880 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:52:10.270 --> 01:52:10.280 align:start position:0%
oplc or the boards how is that how does
 
01:52:12.470 --> 01:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
that how does the function of the
 
01:52:15.790 --> 01:52:15.800 align:start position:0%
Compact and the regulations within the
 
01:52:15.800 --> 01:52:17.790 align:start position:0%
Compact and the regulations within the
compact

01:52:17.790 --> 01:52:17.800 align:start position:0%
compact
 
01:52:22.390 --> 01:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
um affect how op PLC Works in you know
 
01:52:25.109 --> 01:52:25.119 align:start position:0%
during its standard
 
01:52:28.510 --> 01:52:28.520 align:start position:0%
day it it it would not affect what the
 
01:52:31.629 --> 01:52:31.639 align:start position:0%
board or oplc can do at all what the
 
01:52:33.990 --> 01:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
compacts at a higher level it's
 
01:52:36.830 --> 01:52:36.840 align:start position:0%
basically the licensing requirements the
 
01:52:39.750 --> 01:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
licensing of a person not scope of
 
01:52:41.310 --> 01:52:41.320 align:start position:0%
practice within the state that the
 
01:52:44.030 --> 01:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
patient or client is located not the RO
 
01:52:45.669 --> 01:52:45.679 align:start position:0%
laws and the rules of the State of New
 
01:52:48.430 --> 01:52:48.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if somebody's here practicing
 
01:52:51.030 --> 01:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
on a patient client located within the
 
01:52:52.750 --> 01:52:52.760 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire they have to
 
01:52:55.669 --> 01:52:55.679 align:start position:0%
follow all of our laws and rules as they
 
01:52:59.069 --> 01:52:59.079 align:start position:0%
stand right now the only difference is
 
01:53:00.550 --> 01:53:00.560 align:start position:0%
that they're coming and they're getting
 
01:53:03.629 --> 01:53:03.639 align:start position:0%
a quicker license to come in and
 
01:53:05.870 --> 01:53:05.880 align:start position:0%
practice um one of the things that it
 
01:53:08.270 --> 01:53:08.280 align:start position:0%
does regulate is if we were to take away
 
01:53:10.030 --> 01:53:10.040 align:start position:0%
the privilege to practice or another
 
01:53:11.830 --> 01:53:11.840 align:start position:0%
state were to take away a privilege to
 
01:53:14.350 --> 01:53:14.360 align:start position:0%
practice they lose all their privileges
 
01:53:18.270 --> 01:53:18.280 align:start position:0%
to practice um until it's resolved so
 
01:53:20.189 --> 01:53:20.199 align:start position:0%
there's that safeguard that somebody
 
01:53:22.709 --> 01:53:22.719 align:start position:0%
won't lose it in one state and still be
 
01:53:25.069 --> 01:53:25.079 align:start position:0%
practicing here
 
01:53:28.109 --> 01:53:28.119 align:start position:0%
unsafely um okay and could I have one
 
01:53:31.790 --> 01:53:31.800 align:start position:0%
last question Mr chair yes of course um
 
01:53:34.189 --> 01:53:34.199 align:start position:0%
how do we know that this person has lost
 
01:53:36.069 --> 01:53:36.079 align:start position:0%
their license in another state how is
 
01:53:39.149 --> 01:53:39.159 align:start position:0%
that communicated to us the com and I
 
01:53:40.709 --> 01:53:40.719 align:start position:0%
can speak to what I've seen I was
 
01:53:43.390 --> 01:53:43.400 align:start position:0%
involved in the PT Compact and these
 
01:53:46.229 --> 01:53:46.239 align:start position:0%
these two are basically the same the PT
 
01:53:48.430 --> 01:53:48.440 align:start position:0%
compact has been working very well and
 
01:53:51.189 --> 01:53:51.199 align:start position:0%
when somebody gets dis disciplined or
 
01:53:53.229 --> 01:53:53.239 align:start position:0%
something happens in another state that
 
01:53:55.870 --> 01:53:55.880 align:start position:0%
compact commission notifies the state of
 
01:53:59.830 --> 01:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire notifies the board um with
 
01:54:02.470 --> 01:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
um written communication that something
 
01:54:02.480 --> 01:54:04.870 align:start position:0%
um written communication that something
has

01:54:04.870 --> 01:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:07.550 --> 01:54:07.560 align:start position:0%
happened thank you you're
 
01:54:11.470 --> 01:54:11.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:14.709 --> 01:54:14.719 align:start position:0%
gold thank you Mr chair thank you Miss
 
01:54:16.350 --> 01:54:16.360 align:start position:0%
Kelly for taking my
 
01:54:20.669 --> 01:54:20.679 align:start position:0%
question um I heard this uh
 
01:54:24.109 --> 01:54:24.119 align:start position:0%
similar response when we were looking to
 
01:54:26.350 --> 01:54:26.360 align:start position:0%
on the replica build
 
01:54:28.950 --> 01:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
um I hear you say that we need to do
 
01:54:31.669 --> 01:54:31.679 align:start position:0%
this so we can have a seat at the
 
01:54:33.669 --> 01:54:33.679 align:start position:0%
table can you tell me how many people
 
01:54:37.350 --> 01:54:37.360 align:start position:0%
are at that table when we get a seat at
 
01:54:41.229 --> 01:54:41.239 align:start position:0%
it that I'm not sure there is there is a
 
01:54:44.189 --> 01:54:44.199 align:start position:0%
threshold that has to be met in order
 
01:54:46.350 --> 01:54:46.360 align:start position:0%
for the compact to be
 
01:54:49.910 --> 01:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
formed and I want to say 15 but I'm not
 
01:54:51.910 --> 01:54:51.920 align:start position:0%
sure it's right in the compact language
 
01:54:54.629 --> 01:54:54.639 align:start position:0%
itself I'd have to look it up but once
 
01:54:57.990 --> 01:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
that is met then the com the the compact
 
01:54:59.709 --> 01:54:59.719 align:start position:0%
states with a representative from each
 
01:55:02.390 --> 01:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
state come together and they set the
 
01:55:08.109 --> 01:55:08.119 align:start position:0%
rules of how the compact will be um how
 
01:55:12.910 --> 01:55:12.920 align:start position:0%
it will work um like you know the
 
01:55:15.870 --> 01:55:15.880 align:start position:0%
database will work when notifications of
 
01:55:17.990 --> 01:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
discipline are sent out all of those
 
01:55:21.229 --> 01:55:21.239 align:start position:0%
things it sets those proced ures so that
 
01:55:24.069 --> 01:55:24.079 align:start position:0%
they're formulated right in language and
 
01:55:25.790 --> 01:55:25.800 align:start position:0%
it's always good to have a seat at the
 
01:55:27.830 --> 01:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
table when those things are initially
 
01:55:30.189 --> 01:55:30.199 align:start position:0%
being formed that way if you come into
 
01:55:32.669 --> 01:55:32.679 align:start position:0%
the compact later around down the road
 
01:55:34.990 --> 01:55:35.000 align:start position:0%
they're already formed and you have to
 
01:55:36.510 --> 01:55:36.520 align:start position:0%
go through a different process to get
 
01:55:36.520 --> 01:55:37.990 align:start position:0%
go through a different process to get
anything

01:55:37.990 --> 01:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
anything
 
01:55:43.510 --> 01:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
changed does that follow up follow
 
01:55:46.189 --> 01:55:46.199 align:start position:0%
up so my my question
 
01:55:50.149 --> 01:55:50.159 align:start position:0%
is if we're one of say 15 and even
 
01:55:52.189 --> 01:55:52.199 align:start position:0%
though now that we're in this uh we
 
01:55:55.189 --> 01:55:55.199 align:start position:0%
don't agree to Something in those
 
01:55:56.910 --> 01:55:56.920 align:start position:0%
procedures we have to go through the
 
01:55:58.510 --> 01:55:58.520 align:start position:0%
whole process of what we're looking at
 
01:56:01.990 --> 01:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
on repealing replica to get out
 
01:56:05.750 --> 01:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
correct that would be correct but I will
 
01:56:08.470 --> 01:56:08.480 align:start position:0%
say that like I said before the PT
 
01:56:11.830 --> 01:56:11.840 align:start position:0%
compact was enacted I'm thinking four or
 
01:56:14.030 --> 01:56:14.040 align:start position:0%
five years ago we got a seat at that
 
01:56:15.709 --> 01:56:15.719 align:start position:0%
table when that was being
 
01:56:18.270 --> 01:56:18.280 align:start position:0%
formulated it's basically the same type
 
01:56:20.589 --> 01:56:20.599 align:start position:0%
of compact and I can tell you right now
 
01:56:23.550 --> 01:56:23.560 align:start position:0%
the PT compact works
 
01:56:27.310 --> 01:56:27.320 align:start position:0%
wonderfully um it's been very beneficial
 
01:56:30.550 --> 01:56:30.560 align:start position:0%
the people on that um compact
 
01:56:32.990 --> 01:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
commission um they work very closely
 
01:56:34.910 --> 01:56:34.920 align:start position:0%
work together and their goal is
 
01:56:38.270 --> 01:56:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:41.870 --> 01:56:41.880 align:start position:0%
public followup
 
01:56:41.880 --> 01:56:43.990 align:start position:0%
public followup
followup

01:56:43.990 --> 01:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
followup
 
01:56:46.189 --> 01:56:46.199 align:start position:0%
and just because we have the initial
 
01:56:48.390 --> 01:56:48.400 align:start position:0%
seat at the table doesn't guarantee us a
 
01:56:50.589 --> 01:56:50.599 align:start position:0%
seat at the table forever on that board
 
01:56:52.790 --> 01:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
I would imagine that it would rotate
 
01:56:56.229 --> 01:56:56.239 align:start position:0%
through that would be every every state
 
01:56:57.629 --> 01:56:57.639 align:start position:0%
who's part of the commission has a seat
 
01:56:59.430 --> 01:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
at the table when they come on they
 
01:57:01.950 --> 01:57:01.960 align:start position:0%
automatically get a seat it would be the
 
01:57:03.870 --> 01:57:03.880 align:start position:0%
officers that may be rotated there may
 
01:57:06.390 --> 01:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
be five or six officers you know a a
 
01:57:08.229 --> 01:57:08.239 align:start position:0%
chair a vice chair I'm not sure how it's
 
01:57:11.229 --> 01:57:11.239 align:start position:0%
going to be but it would be that similar
 
01:57:15.069 --> 01:57:15.079 align:start position:0%
structure just just like a board would
 
01:57:17.229 --> 01:57:17.239 align:start position:0%
work and one last
 
01:57:20.550 --> 01:57:20.560 align:start position:0%
followup last followup
 
01:57:24.109 --> 01:57:24.119 align:start position:0%
so as the numbers increase or the makeup
 
01:57:28.510 --> 01:57:28.520 align:start position:0%
of the seats at the table change the um
 
01:57:30.790 --> 01:57:30.800 align:start position:0%
initial seat at the table that we had in
 
01:57:32.790 --> 01:57:32.800 align:start position:0%
making these rules obviously could
 
01:57:35.830 --> 01:57:35.840 align:start position:0%
change and may not to be completely to
 
01:57:37.149 --> 01:57:37.159 align:start position:0%
our liking we may not agree to
 
01:57:39.709 --> 01:57:39.719 align:start position:0%
everything that is in there further on
 
01:57:42.430 --> 01:57:42.440 align:start position:0%
down the road correct that could happen
 
01:57:45.109 --> 01:57:45.119 align:start position:0%
but we get a vote on whatever changes
 
01:57:47.229 --> 01:57:47.239 align:start position:0%
would be made we always have a vote we
 
01:57:50.229 --> 01:57:50.239 align:start position:0%
always have a say and
 
01:57:53.709 --> 01:57:53.719 align:start position:0%
so yeah it may not be to our liking but
 
01:57:56.510 --> 01:57:56.520 align:start position:0%
the core requirements for
 
01:58:00.910 --> 01:58:00.920 align:start position:0%
lure and the core um outline of what it
 
01:58:02.709 --> 01:58:02.719 align:start position:0%
is going to look like to be part of that
 
01:58:06.470 --> 01:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
compact is in legislation so I don't
 
01:58:08.470 --> 01:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
anticipate there there would be anything
 
01:58:12.189 --> 01:58:12.199 align:start position:0%
that could be put forth that would be so
 
01:58:14.709 --> 01:58:14.719 align:start position:0%
detrimental that the board or the state
 
01:58:18.310 --> 01:58:18.320 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire would see that as
 
01:58:20.830 --> 01:58:20.840 align:start position:0%
something that would
 
01:58:24.830 --> 01:58:24.840 align:start position:0%
um push them forward to get out of the
 
01:58:28.709 --> 01:58:28.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:32.430 --> 01:58:32.440 align:start position:0%
you thank you um I'd like to just ask a
 
01:58:35.470 --> 01:58:35.480 align:start position:0%
a question for myself if I may
 
01:58:39.270 --> 01:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
if let's say that during the an annual
 
01:58:42.270 --> 01:58:42.280 align:start position:0%
meeting a proposal is made that New
 
01:58:44.069 --> 01:58:44.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does not agree with can you
 
01:58:45.669 --> 01:58:45.679 align:start position:0%
could you explain the process how that
 
01:58:48.069 --> 01:58:48.079 align:start position:0%
would work and
 
01:58:49.910 --> 01:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:58:52.069 --> 01:58:52.079 align:start position:0%
how we could avoid
 
01:58:55.910 --> 01:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
that so if we didn't agree with with
 
01:58:57.629 --> 01:58:57.639 align:start position:0%
something that was being put forward it
 
01:58:59.950 --> 01:58:59.960 align:start position:0%
would be just like on a board you would
 
01:59:02.069 --> 01:59:02.079 align:start position:0%
discuss it you with all the other
 
01:59:03.709 --> 01:59:03.719 align:start position:0%
members with a representative from each
 
01:59:06.270 --> 01:59:06.280 align:start position:0%
other each other state all the members
 
01:59:08.830 --> 01:59:08.840 align:start position:0%
and it would be majority
 
01:59:12.390 --> 01:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
vote um but like I said I don't see
 
01:59:16.109 --> 01:59:16.119 align:start position:0%
because the core and the basics that
 
01:59:19.629 --> 01:59:19.639 align:start position:0%
really structure this are in this law I
 
01:59:21.870 --> 01:59:21.880 align:start position:0%
don't anticipate there would be anything
 
01:59:23.270 --> 01:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
that would come out of this that would
 
01:59:25.350 --> 01:59:25.360 align:start position:0%
be so detrimental the board would feel
 
01:59:28.550 --> 01:59:28.560 align:start position:0%
that it was necessary to get
 
01:59:30.390 --> 01:59:30.400 align:start position:0%
out thank
 
01:59:32.709 --> 01:59:32.719 align:start position:0%
you representative L
 
01:59:34.870 --> 01:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
Lake thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:59:37.629 --> 01:59:37.639 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um this may have
 
01:59:41.189 --> 01:59:41.199 align:start position:0%
been answered already but um there's a
 
01:59:42.870 --> 01:59:42.880 align:start position:0%
lot to digest in this so I'm going to
 
01:59:44.510 --> 01:59:44.520 align:start position:0%
ask again in case it
 
01:59:47.350 --> 01:59:47.360 align:start position:0%
hasn't suppose something came up uh
 
01:59:49.629 --> 01:59:49.639 align:start position:0%
there was a change in the board meeting
 
01:59:52.430 --> 01:59:52.440 align:start position:0%
um I mean I'm sorry at at the board
 
01:59:54.750 --> 01:59:54.760 align:start position:0%
meeting that New Hampshire found to be
 
01:59:58.189 --> 01:59:58.199 align:start position:0%
an irreconcilable difference is there a
 
02:00:01.669 --> 02:00:01.679 align:start position:0%
penalty for any um compact
 
02:00:05.310 --> 02:00:05.320 align:start position:0%
member to just throw up their hands and
 
02:00:05.320 --> 02:00:06.350 align:start position:0%
member to just throw up their hands and
get

02:00:06.350 --> 02:00:06.360 align:start position:0%
get
 
02:00:08.990 --> 02:00:09.000 align:start position:0%
out well if we were to get out of the
 
02:00:10.990 --> 02:00:11.000 align:start position:0%
compact if we were to repeal this
 
02:00:13.629 --> 02:00:13.639 align:start position:0%
legislation once it's enacted then
 
02:00:15.669 --> 02:00:15.679 align:start position:0%
anybody who had a privilege to practice
 
02:00:18.350 --> 02:00:18.360 align:start position:0%
would lose that privilege to practice
 
02:00:20.270 --> 02:00:20.280 align:start position:0%
and they would have to go and get
 
02:00:22.390 --> 02:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
licenses from each state that they wish
 
02:00:25.910 --> 02:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
to hold a license in well so then in
 
02:00:27.750 --> 02:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
other words we would just be back to
 
02:00:29.629 --> 02:00:29.639 align:start position:0%
where we were without the compact it's
 
02:00:31.669 --> 02:00:31.679 align:start position:0%
it's uh other than that there's no
 
02:00:33.390 --> 02:00:33.400 align:start position:0%
detriment to just throwing up our hands
 
02:00:35.550 --> 02:00:35.560 align:start position:0%
and leaving if we found it necessary
 
02:00:38.750 --> 02:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
correct thank you representative scitec
 
02:00:41.790 --> 02:00:41.800 align:start position:0%
U I'm getting the analogy here that the
 
02:00:43.990 --> 02:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
compact is really a super
 
02:00:46.629 --> 02:00:46.639 align:start position:0%
oplc you don't have anything to do the
 
02:00:48.109 --> 02:00:48.119 align:start position:0%
compact will have nothing to do with the
 
02:00:50.629 --> 02:00:50.639 align:start position:0%
scope of practice which is the thing
 
02:00:53.750 --> 02:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
that would concern me most right that's
 
02:00:56.270 --> 02:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
correct if when somebody's practicing in
 
02:00:59.350 --> 02:00:59.360 align:start position:0%
this state they have to follow all the
 
02:01:00.709 --> 02:01:00.719 align:start position:0%
laws and rules and that would be
 
02:01:02.790 --> 02:01:02.800 align:start position:0%
everything that's currently on the books
 
02:01:04.310 --> 02:01:04.320 align:start position:0%
they have to follow everything and the
 
02:01:08.229 --> 02:01:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:12.910 --> 02:01:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:17.069 --> 02:01:17.079 align:start position:0%
Gro thank you Mr chair um Miss Kelly if
 
02:01:19.750 --> 02:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
we wanted to know which um
 
02:01:22.229 --> 02:01:22.239 align:start position:0%
compacts and which
 
02:01:25.310 --> 02:01:25.320 align:start position:0%
um reciprocity agreements we have in
 
02:01:27.950 --> 02:01:27.960 align:start position:0%
place where would we find that
 
02:01:31.030 --> 02:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
information we could get that from
 
02:01:33.709 --> 02:01:33.719 align:start position:0%
oplc would you be able to provide that
 
02:01:37.149 --> 02:01:37.159 align:start position:0%
to us please y thank
 
02:01:39.669 --> 02:01:39.679 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
02:01:42.669 --> 02:01:42.679 align:start position:0%
Pearson thank you Mr chair my inquiry
 
02:01:45.750 --> 02:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
involves uh liability and
 
02:01:48.430 --> 02:01:48.440 align:start position:0%
insurance currently depending on your
 
02:01:50.910 --> 02:01:50.920 align:start position:0%
profession and whether or not you're a
 
02:01:52.910 --> 02:01:52.920 align:start position:0%
government employee there are certain
 
02:01:55.790 --> 02:01:55.800 align:start position:0%
insurance policies for various things
 
02:02:00.069 --> 02:02:00.079 align:start position:0%
negligence and and um malpractice and
 
02:02:03.629 --> 02:02:03.639 align:start position:0%
whatnot now with this compact that
 
02:02:06.229 --> 02:02:06.239 align:start position:0%
you're talking about these folks are
 
02:02:08.510 --> 02:02:08.520 align:start position:0%
going to I would is it fair to presume
 
02:02:11.069 --> 02:02:11.079 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be covered by their
 
02:02:13.510 --> 02:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
insurance automatically in other states
 
02:02:14.990 --> 02:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
are you know are we looking at a
 
02:02:17.629 --> 02:02:17.639 align:start position:0%
situation where folks if they decide to
 
02:02:19.750 --> 02:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
to be involved at this level
 
02:02:22.470 --> 02:02:22.480 align:start position:0%
they would have to expand the the
 
02:02:24.350 --> 02:02:24.360 align:start position:0%
insurance that they carry to cover them
 
02:02:27.390 --> 02:02:27.400 align:start position:0%
practicing outside of their home state I
 
02:02:29.950 --> 02:02:29.960 align:start position:0%
I do not have any idea I would imagine
 
02:02:31.910 --> 02:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
that they would have to because all
 
02:02:33.310 --> 02:02:33.320 align:start position:0%
insurance companies are different and
 
02:02:35.669 --> 02:02:35.679 align:start position:0%
coverage is different they to contact
 
02:02:38.510 --> 02:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
their insurance company to see what it
 
02:02:40.470 --> 02:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
exactly covered and what they would have
 
02:02:40.480 --> 02:02:43.709 align:start position:0%
exactly covered and what they would have
to

02:02:43.709 --> 02:02:43.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:47.350 --> 02:02:47.360 align:start position:0%
do thank you Miss Kelly I'd like to ask
 
02:02:49.510 --> 02:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
a question with regards to the insurance
 
02:02:51.950 --> 02:02:51.960 align:start position:0%
that just piqued my interest
 
02:02:54.750 --> 02:02:54.760 align:start position:0%
does New Hampshire currently cover
 
02:02:57.830 --> 02:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
require insurance for this profession
 
02:03:01.069 --> 02:03:01.079 align:start position:0%
and as part of the compact people would
 
02:03:03.229 --> 02:03:03.239 align:start position:0%
have to um comport themselves to the
 
02:03:04.950 --> 02:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire requirements they would by
 
02:03:06.750 --> 02:03:06.760 align:start position:0%
necessity have to obtain insurance is
 
02:03:06.760 --> 02:03:07.550 align:start position:0%
necessity have to obtain insurance is
that

02:03:07.550 --> 02:03:07.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:03:09.950 --> 02:03:09.960 align:start position:0%
correct from what I understand from the
 
02:03:12.229 --> 02:03:12.239 align:start position:0%
board's administrative rules there is no
 
02:03:13.910 --> 02:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
requirement in those administrative
 
02:03:16.589 --> 02:03:16.599 align:start position:0%
rules that dictates what insurance
 
02:03:21.229 --> 02:03:21.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:24.550 --> 02:03:24.560 align:start position:0%
but if New Hampshire requires Insurance
 
02:03:26.709 --> 02:03:26.719 align:start position:0%
in to practice in our state you have to
 
02:03:29.030 --> 02:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
follow the rules of the state you're in
 
02:03:30.750 --> 02:03:30.760 align:start position:0%
would that not mean then that you would
 
02:03:33.950 --> 02:03:33.960 align:start position:0%
need to have insurance that is correct
 
02:03:33.960 --> 02:03:36.069 align:start position:0%
need to have insurance that is correct
thank

02:03:36.069 --> 02:03:36.079 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:03:39.030 --> 02:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
you representative brto
 
02:03:41.149 --> 02:03:41.159 align:start position:0%
followup you have another question oh
 
02:03:43.510 --> 02:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
I'm so sorry I forgot to lower my hand
 
02:03:47.870 --> 02:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
apologies okay representative scitech
 
02:03:50.430 --> 02:03:50.440 align:start position:0%
um you'll see where I'm going with this
 
02:03:52.790 --> 02:03:52.800 align:start position:0%
question have we had any bad experiences
 
02:03:57.149 --> 02:03:57.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:00.310 --> 02:04:00.320 align:start position:0%
compacts I can't ex I can't speak to all
 
02:04:02.870 --> 02:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
the other compacts the one compact that
 
02:04:05.030 --> 02:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
I've been involved with is the physical
 
02:04:06.990 --> 02:04:07.000 align:start position:0%
therapy governing board's
 
02:04:09.709 --> 02:04:09.719 align:start position:0%
compact um and from everything I've
 
02:04:11.149 --> 02:04:11.159 align:start position:0%
known and I was in that from its
 
02:04:14.030 --> 02:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
Inception involved in that I have not
 
02:04:16.990 --> 02:04:17.000 align:start position:0%
seen anything that we ran
 
02:04:20.069 --> 02:04:20.079 align:start position:0%
into that was any kind of an issue at
 
02:04:22.310 --> 02:04:22.320 align:start position:0%
all there might have been one thing at
 
02:04:25.709 --> 02:04:25.719 align:start position:0%
the very beginning with um lenses and it
 
02:04:28.109 --> 02:04:28.119 align:start position:0%
was to do with insurance but I think it
 
02:04:30.709 --> 02:04:30.719 align:start position:0%
was um Medicare or Medicaid and that was
 
02:04:32.470 --> 02:04:32.480 align:start position:0%
all worked out I have no idea what it
 
02:04:34.390 --> 02:04:34.400 align:start position:0%
was but I know there was a little glitch
 
02:04:36.270 --> 02:04:36.280 align:start position:0%
the compact commission worked on it it
 
02:04:39.430 --> 02:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
was all resolved so I'm and once those
 
02:04:41.669 --> 02:04:41.679 align:start position:0%
get resolved they carry through to other
 
02:04:47.750 --> 02:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:50.229 --> 02:04:50.239 align:start position:0%
understanding thank you any further
 
02:04:53.189 --> 02:04:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:56.790 --> 02:04:56.800 align:start position:0%
Kelly seeing none thank you Miss Kelly
 
02:05:01.470 --> 02:05:01.480 align:start position:0%

interstate licensing compact for our
 
02:05:30.669 --> 02:05:30.679 align:start position:0%

number of state legislators State

phone calls and webinars to discuss the
 
02:05:42.549 --> 02:05:42.559 align:start position:0%
Compact and how it could work um as
 
02:05:44.830 --> 02:05:44.840 align:start position:0%
you've heard from Mr Arnold we work
 
02:05:46.189 --> 02:05:46.199 align:start position:0%
specifically with the Department of

02:06:04.069 --> 02:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
necessitating an individual become
 
02:06:06.870 --> 02:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
licensed in every state and it increases
 
02:06:08.709 --> 02:06:08.719 align:start position:0%
consumer protection by expanding the
 
02:06:11.629 --> 02:06:11.639 align:start position:0%
prosecutorial net for Bad actors it's
 
02:06:13.669 --> 02:06:13.679 align:start position:0%
very similar in Form and Function to the
 
02:06:15.669 --> 02:06:15.679 align:start position:0%
current occupational lens or compacts
 
02:06:17.990 --> 02:06:18.000 align:start position:0%

02:06:19.830 --> 02:06:19.840 align:start position:0%
physical therapy
 
02:06:21.790 --> 02:06:21.800 align:start position:0%
we now have 10 states that have passed
 
02:06:23.669 --> 02:06:23.679 align:start position:0%
the legislation which is the threshold
 
02:06:26.069 --> 02:06:26.079 align:start position:0%
for the compact commission to begin
 
02:06:28.549 --> 02:06:28.559 align:start position:0%
operations um those 10 initial member
 
02:06:31.030 --> 02:06:31.040 align:start position:0%
states are Alabama Kansas Kentucky
 
02:06:34.030 --> 02:06:34.040 align:start position:0%
Louisiana Oklahoma Nebraska North
 
02:06:37.430 --> 02:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
Carolina Utah West Virginia and Wyoming
 
02:06:39.510 --> 02:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
in addition Georgia and Maryland have
 
02:06:41.350 --> 02:06:41.360 align:start position:0%
passed their legislation and it's
 
02:06:43.390 --> 02:06:43.400 align:start position:0%
awaiting signatures by their
 
02:06:46.790 --> 02:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
Governors um given that we have the 10
 
02:06:49.030 --> 02:06:49.040 align:start position:0%
states that can begin operations we
 
02:06:51.510 --> 02:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
don't expect a commission meeting to be
 
02:06:54.430 --> 02:06:54.440 align:start position:0%
to be held until probably the fall so
 
02:06:57.149 --> 02:06:57.159 align:start position:0%
any states that pass uh the the
 
02:06:58.910 --> 02:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
legislation between now and then would
 
02:07:01.310 --> 02:07:01.320 align:start position:0%
also have a seat at that initial um
 
02:07:03.430 --> 02:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
meeting and that's the meeting where the
 
02:07:06.510 --> 02:07:06.520 align:start position:0%
rules and the bylaws for the compact um
 
02:07:08.669 --> 02:07:08.679 align:start position:0%
will be developed so those states that
 
02:07:10.470 --> 02:07:10.480 align:start position:0%
are sitting at that table will have
 
02:07:13.149 --> 02:07:13.159 align:start position:0%
probably the most influence on what goes
 
02:07:15.990 --> 02:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
into those rules and bylaws it's
 
02:07:17.950 --> 02:07:17.960 align:start position:0%
unlikely that those rules and bylaws
 
02:07:20.430 --> 02:07:20.440 align:start position:0%
will change much if at all um once
 
02:07:22.709 --> 02:07:22.719 align:start position:0%
they're developed by the states and
 
02:07:24.549 --> 02:07:24.559 align:start position:0%
other states are expected to take those
 
02:07:26.390 --> 02:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
rules and bylaws in addition to the
 
02:07:28.350 --> 02:07:28.360 align:start position:0%
compact language
 
02:07:32.069 --> 02:07:32.079 align:start position:0%
in uh and and be able to follow those um
 
02:07:34.030 --> 02:07:34.040 align:start position:0%
once they join the compact at a later
 
02:07:37.310 --> 02:07:37.320 align:start position:0%
date um so I hope we can count on your
 
02:07:39.069 --> 02:07:39.079 align:start position:0%
support to move this bill forward so
 
02:07:40.510 --> 02:07:40.520 align:start position:0%
that we can increase care for the
 
02:07:42.229 --> 02:07:42.239 align:start position:0%
residents of new New Hampshire with
 
02:07:44.669 --> 02:07:44.679 align:start position:0%
communication disorders and I'm happy to
 
02:07:46.430 --> 02:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
answer any questions you may have and
 
02:07:48.189 --> 02:07:48.199 align:start position:0%
can be available to the subcommittee if
 
02:07:48.199 --> 02:07:50.589 align:start position:0%
can be available to the subcommittee if
needed

02:07:50.589 --> 02:07:50.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:52.470 --> 02:07:52.480 align:start position:0%
any questions for Miss
 
02:07:55.990 --> 02:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
Adams representa do you have any sense
 
02:07:58.109 --> 02:07:58.119 align:start position:0%
thank you do you have any sense of why
 
02:08:00.270 --> 02:08:00.280 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania New York Vermont
 
02:08:02.669 --> 02:08:02.679 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts places a little closer to
 
02:08:06.350 --> 02:08:06.360 align:start position:0%
us have not gotten into this why are we
 
02:08:10.790 --> 02:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
the uh the uh guinea pigs of the East
 
02:08:13.870 --> 02:08:13.880 align:start position:0%
Coast um thank you for your question
 
02:08:15.990 --> 02:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
representative uh there States really
 
02:08:18.790 --> 02:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
have a a variety of reasons as to they
 
02:08:20.950 --> 02:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
haven't joined the compact uh
 
02:08:24.549 --> 02:08:24.559 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts for example has a an issue
 
02:08:26.149 --> 02:08:26.159 align:start position:0%
that they're working on that's very
 
02:08:27.910 --> 02:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
important to them and that's lure for
 
02:08:30.069 --> 02:08:30.079 align:start position:0%
clinical fellows they're the only state
 
02:08:32.350 --> 02:08:32.360 align:start position:0%
in the country that doesn't license uh
 
02:08:34.030 --> 02:08:34.040 align:start position:0%
speech language pathology clinical
 
02:08:35.629 --> 02:08:35.639 align:start position:0%
fellows so they really want that
 
02:08:37.549 --> 02:08:37.559 align:start position:0%
legislation to pass because they've been
 
02:08:39.830 --> 02:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
working on it for so long before they
 
02:08:43.790 --> 02:08:43.800 align:start position:0%
take up a new um a new issue so to speak
 
02:08:46.189 --> 02:08:46.199 align:start position:0%
um Pennsylvania is interested we are
 
02:08:47.950 --> 02:08:47.960 align:start position:0%
hoping that we'll get a bill introduced
 
02:08:50.830 --> 02:08:50.840 align:start position:0%
there next year um New York for example
 
02:08:53.229 --> 02:08:53.239 align:start position:0%
just doesn't generally like compacts and
 
02:08:54.750 --> 02:08:54.760 align:start position:0%
they're one of those states that hasn't
 
02:08:57.030 --> 02:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
joined any compact so they're probably
 
02:08:58.910 --> 02:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
not going to be the front runner they're
 
02:09:00.510 --> 02:09:00.520 align:start position:0%
going to be the probably the last state
 
02:09:03.390 --> 02:09:03.400 align:start position:0%
to join so this is only our second year
 
02:09:04.430 --> 02:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
in state

all morning and he did not come back so
 
03:31:05.630 --> 03:31:05.640 align:start position:0%
um I can give him a call right now I
 
03:31:09.790 --> 03:31:09.800 align:start position:0%
thought he would return okay if not we
 
03:31:39.950 --> 03:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:39.960 --> 03:32:05.349 align:start position:0%

03:32:07.349 --> 03:32:07.359 align:start position:0%
in that case representative McGee if you
 
03:32:09.229 --> 03:32:09.239 align:start position:0%
would care to introduce this section of
 
03:32:11.790 --> 03:32:11.800 align:start position:0%
the bill since you're a co-sponsor
 
03:32:15.710 --> 03:32:15.720 align:start position:0%

have heard your bill on music therapists
 
03:32:23.070 --> 03:32:23.080 align:start position:0%
and we heard all the testimony so you
 
03:32:24.870 --> 03:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
don't need to
 
03:32:27.630 --> 03:32:27.640 align:start position:0%
repeat I would hope it would be this
 
03:32:30.269 --> 03:32:30.279 align:start position:0%
should be a fairly brief section thank
 
03:32:32.790 --> 03:32:32.800 align:start position:0%

03:32:34.830 --> 03:32:34.840 align:start position:0%

03:32:36.950 --> 03:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
representative C McGee of Hillsboro 27
 
03:32:39.309 --> 03:32:39.319 align:start position:0%
Hollis and I'm here today uh
 
03:32:41.349 --> 03:32:41.359 align:start position:0%
representing my constituent who is a
 
03:32:43.229 --> 03:32:43.239 align:start position:0%
board-certified music therapist Shannon
 
03:32:45.630 --> 03:32:45.640 align:start position:0%
Lane who is the current director of
 
03:32:47.389 --> 03:32:47.399 align:start position:0%
music therapy and adaptive lessons in
 
03:32:49.229 --> 03:32:49.239 align:start position:0%
early childhood at the Manchester
 
03:32:52.070 --> 03:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
Community Music School um she was the
 
03:32:54.910 --> 03:32:54.920 align:start position:0%
first person to bring me uh this issue
 
03:32:56.990 --> 03:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
and I had submitted a bill to this
 
03:33:01.110 --> 03:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
Committee in the last session which um
 
03:33:02.670 --> 03:33:02.680 align:start position:0%
was one of the
 
03:33:05.110 --> 03:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
predicating reasons for the bill that's
 
03:33:07.590 --> 03:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
before you today so I only bring that
 
03:33:09.830 --> 03:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
history up because that bill was heard
 
03:33:12.830 --> 03:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
by this committee in January of 2020 and
 
03:33:15.349 --> 03:33:15.359 align:start position:0%
then there was a subsequent subcommittee
 
03:33:17.910 --> 03:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
and the language resulting from uh the
 
03:33:20.790 --> 03:33:20.800 align:start position:0%
four meetings of that subcommittee uh
 
03:33:23.229 --> 03:33:23.239 align:start position:0%
evolved into the language that is before
 
03:33:28.189 --> 03:33:28.199 align:start position:0%
you on pages 38 to 41 of SB 133 which is
 
03:33:32.229 --> 03:33:32.239 align:start position:0%
section six and that is the uh lure and
 
03:33:37.229 --> 03:33:37.239 align:start position:0%
regulation of music therapy so um let's
 
03:33:39.070 --> 03:33:39.080 align:start position:0%
see the committee's quite familiar with
 
03:33:41.150 --> 03:33:41.160 align:start position:0%
the bill as the chairwoman are already
 
03:33:44.670 --> 03:33:44.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned um and
 
03:33:47.110 --> 03:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
um and the content so I'm not planning
 
03:33:50.070 --> 03:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
to go over anything about oursa 328 F on
 
03:33:52.510 --> 03:33:52.520 align:start position:0%
Allied health professionals and I
 
03:33:56.150 --> 03:33:56.160 align:start position:0%
believe um Marissa Scott is here to
 
03:33:57.830 --> 03:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
answer any questions about the
 
03:34:00.349 --> 03:34:00.359 align:start position:0%
profession for herself or colleagues I
 
03:34:03.309 --> 03:34:03.319 align:start position:0%
can just say that as I've grown um in
 
03:34:05.550 --> 03:34:05.560 align:start position:0%
being a member of the house I've learned
 
03:34:07.189 --> 03:34:07.199 align:start position:0%
about the process of lawmaking and I
 
03:34:08.950 --> 03:34:08.960 align:start position:0%
believe that one of the most inspiring
 
03:34:11.550 --> 03:34:11.560 align:start position:0%
aspects of our work is really to watch
 
03:34:13.630 --> 03:34:13.640 align:start position:0%
people step up and let their
 
03:34:15.429 --> 03:34:15.439 align:start position:0%
representatives know what it is that
 
03:34:17.750 --> 03:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
they need from us and then teaching us
 
03:34:20.510 --> 03:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
what we don't know I've learned a great
 
03:34:22.150 --> 03:34:22.160 align:start position:0%
deal about music therapy and about the
 
03:34:24.110 --> 03:34:24.120 align:start position:0%
caring professionals who use this form
 
03:34:26.790 --> 03:34:26.800 align:start position:0%
of therapy to transform their clients
 
03:34:28.990 --> 03:34:29.000 align:start position:0%
lives with tailored plans and and
 
03:34:32.630 --> 03:34:32.640 align:start position:0%
quantifiable goals um and I just uh
 
03:34:36.070 --> 03:34:36.080 align:start position:0%
relate this to I broke my wrist in 2018
 
03:34:37.670 --> 03:34:37.680 align:start position:0%
and I ended up working with a pair of
 
03:34:39.670 --> 03:34:39.680 align:start position:0%
hand therapists at Apple Therapy in
 
03:34:42.349 --> 03:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
nashwa um I started out with little to
 
03:34:45.070 --> 03:34:45.080 align:start position:0%
no mobility and strength was not even on
 
03:34:48.070 --> 03:34:48.080 align:start position:0%
the menu so I have some understanding
 
03:34:51.510 --> 03:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
for what it means to have a significant
 
03:34:54.229 --> 03:34:54.239 align:start position:0%
disability that needs to be tended to by
 
03:34:56.189 --> 03:34:56.199 align:start position:0%
someone who actually understands how to
 
03:34:59.349 --> 03:34:59.359 align:start position:0%
nurture you through the process and that
 
03:35:01.550 --> 03:35:01.560 align:start position:0%
is how I relate to what I have learned
 
03:35:04.110 --> 03:35:04.120 align:start position:0%
about um these certified music
 
03:35:07.189 --> 03:35:07.199 align:start position:0%
therapists um so just imagine how a
 
03:35:09.469 --> 03:35:09.479 align:start position:0%
board certified music therapist is
 
03:35:11.189 --> 03:35:11.199 align:start position:0%
uniquely qualified to do that type of
 
03:35:14.110 --> 03:35:14.120 align:start position:0%
therapy meeting with a meeting a client
 
03:35:16.469 --> 03:35:16.479 align:start position:0%
with neurological or developmental
 
03:35:18.630 --> 03:35:18.640 align:start position:0%
limitations where they are and then
 
03:35:21.030 --> 03:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
gradually moving them towards greater
 
03:35:23.429 --> 03:35:23.439 align:start position:0%
functionality um it's Noble and unique
 
03:35:25.269 --> 03:35:25.279 align:start position:0%
work and these talented patient
 
03:35:27.710 --> 03:35:27.720 align:start position:0%
professionals want to be legitimized for
 
03:35:29.229 --> 03:35:29.239 align:start position:0%
the education that they Undertake and
 
03:35:30.870 --> 03:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
the caring that they display and doing
 
03:35:32.349 --> 03:35:32.359 align:start position:0%
meaningful work for the clients they
 
03:35:35.189 --> 03:35:35.199 align:start position:0%
serve this is not a therapy that
 
03:35:37.469 --> 03:35:37.479 align:start position:0%
detracts from other forms of therapy
 
03:35:39.590 --> 03:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
it's a specific form of therapy that is
 
03:35:41.630 --> 03:35:41.640 align:start position:0%
applied when it is the appropriate
 
03:35:44.670 --> 03:35:44.680 align:start position:0%
choice and um just like I would not see
 
03:35:46.950 --> 03:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
a back specialist when rehabbing a
 
03:35:49.269 --> 03:35:49.279 align:start position:0%
broken wrist so that I could regain use
 
03:35:53.670 --> 03:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
of my dominant hand um the this
 
03:35:56.030 --> 03:35:56.040 align:start position:0%
particular form of therapy I think its
 
03:35:58.830 --> 03:35:58.840 align:start position:0%
time has come in terms of being added to
 
03:36:00.750 --> 03:36:00.760 align:start position:0%
the Allied therapies that are available
 
03:36:03.070 --> 03:36:03.080 align:start position:0%
to people in New Hampshire and I'm sure
 
03:36:05.510 --> 03:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
you'll hear more on that later today so
 
03:36:07.309 --> 03:36:07.319 align:start position:0%
I hope that you can see your way clear
 
03:36:11.309 --> 03:36:11.319 align:start position:0%
to passing section six of H of SB 133
 
03:36:13.469 --> 03:36:13.479 align:start position:0%
here today to save us all from doing it
 
03:36:15.030 --> 03:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
again because in case you haven't
 
03:36:18.790 --> 03:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
noticed these music uh therapy folks are
 
03:36:21.189 --> 03:36:21.199 align:start position:0%
very determined they're not going to
 
03:36:24.309 --> 03:36:24.319 align:start position:0%
stop until um until they can find that
 
03:36:26.790 --> 03:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
they have the lure and and
 
03:36:29.429 --> 03:36:29.439 align:start position:0%
Regulatory um supports that they require
 
03:36:31.429 --> 03:36:31.439 align:start position:0%
excuse me representative McGee are you
 
03:36:31.439 --> 03:36:33.110 align:start position:0%
excuse me representative McGee are you
threatening

03:36:33.110 --> 03:36:33.120 align:start position:0%
threatening
 
03:36:36.110 --> 03:36:36.120 align:start position:0%
us well at this point I feel it there's
 
03:36:38.630 --> 03:36:38.640 align:start position:0%
no harm no harm no
 
03:36:42.870 --> 03:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
foul um no I am not but I I think I
 
03:36:45.269 --> 03:36:45.279 align:start position:0%
think I want you to understand how much
 
03:36:48.110 --> 03:36:48.120 align:start position:0%
determination the people that I have met

and I'm a female business owner in the
 
03:38:29.510 --> 03:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire I live in Dover

where my business where I run my
 
03:38:34.030 --> 03:38:34.040 align:start position:0%
business um with my husband and my four
 
03:38:37.750 --> 03:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
kids um and I I've previously come to
 
03:38:41.269 --> 03:38:41.279 align:start position:0%
you before to discuss the lure of Music
 
03:38:43.710 --> 03:38:43.720 align:start position:0%
therapists and specifically how it will
 
03:38:45.910 --> 03:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
help constituents by increasing access
 
03:38:50.349 --> 03:38:50.359 align:start position:0%
to services and um allowing constituents
 
03:38:53.870 --> 03:38:53.880 align:start position:0%
to find a qualified provider um we do
 
03:38:55.590 --> 03:38:55.600 align:start position:0%
have several instances right now of
 
03:38:57.469 --> 03:38:57.479 align:start position:0%
people saying you know oh I do music
 
03:38:59.349 --> 03:38:59.359 align:start position:0%
therapy and they have no Education and
 
03:39:01.710 --> 03:39:01.720 align:start position:0%
Training so that's just really wanting
 
03:39:04.950 --> 03:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
to protect the um the Education and
 
03:39:07.510 --> 03:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
Training of a music therapist um and
 
03:39:09.229 --> 03:39:09.239 align:start position:0%
also you know protecting the
 
03:39:11.510 --> 03:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
constituents um and so since I've
 
03:39:14.030 --> 03:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
already spoken uh at Great length on
 
03:39:16.070 --> 03:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
this topic I would like to be mindful of
 
03:39:17.870 --> 03:39:17.880 align:start position:0%
your time but I wanted you know that I
 
03:39:20.309 --> 03:39:20.319 align:start position:0%
am here I'm happy to answer
 
03:39:24.389 --> 03:39:24.399 align:start position:0%
questions um and I participated fully in
 
03:39:26.469 --> 03:39:26.479 align:start position:0%
the Senate hearings and there was no
 
03:39:28.309 --> 03:39:28.319 align:start position:0%
opposition to our section during the
 
03:39:32.189 --> 03:39:32.199 align:start position:0%
Senate process thank you um I had a
 
03:39:35.229 --> 03:39:35.239 align:start position:0%
question when we heard the
 
03:39:39.229 --> 03:39:39.239 align:start position:0%
representative McGee's House Bill
 
03:39:42.309 --> 03:39:42.319 align:start position:0%
the speech language Pathologists were
 
03:39:44.229 --> 03:39:44.239 align:start position:0%
still concerned about the scope of
 
03:39:49.389 --> 03:39:49.399 align:start position:0%
practice in music therapy has that been
 
03:39:52.269 --> 03:39:52.279 align:start position:0%
resolved uh yeah so I think part of the
 
03:39:54.429 --> 03:39:54.439 align:start position:0%
the um thank you for your question the
 
03:39:57.590 --> 03:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
part of the problem was that
 
03:40:00.429 --> 03:40:00.439 align:start position:0%
um the American Music Therapy
 
03:40:02.750 --> 03:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
Association and the American Speech
 
03:40:05.189 --> 03:40:05.199 align:start position:0%
Therapy Association are communicating
 
03:40:07.550 --> 03:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
with each other at the national level
 
03:40:09.189 --> 03:40:09.199 align:start position:0%
and they have agreed upon the language
 
03:40:11.349 --> 03:40:11.359 align:start position:0%
that's being being put forth in the
 
03:40:13.070 --> 03:40:13.080 align:start position:0%
bills that are going out in different
 
03:40:15.389 --> 03:40:15.399 align:start position:0%
states and it doesn't always trickle
 
03:40:17.910 --> 03:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
down to the state level in time but we
 
03:40:20.389 --> 03:40:20.399 align:start position:0%
have what is in this bill the agreed
 
03:40:25.870 --> 03:40:25.880 align:start position:0%
upon language between um AMTA and um and
 
03:40:29.710 --> 03:40:29.720 align:start position:0%
Asha and so it's just a a matter of
 
03:40:32.309 --> 03:40:32.319 align:start position:0%
communicating at the state level as well
 
03:40:34.710 --> 03:40:34.720 align:start position:0%
um we're open to communicating with them
 
03:40:37.710 --> 03:40:37.720 align:start position:0%
but the language in this bill was what
 
03:40:41.469 --> 03:40:41.479 align:start position:0%
both agencies agreed upon
 
03:40:49.150 --> 03:40:49.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:52.349 --> 03:40:52.359 align:start position:0%
questions okay seeing
 
03:40:59.590 --> 03:40:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:09.030 --> 03:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:09.040 --> 03:41:18.990 align:start position:0%
 
Adams

03:41:18.990 --> 03:41:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:21.309 --> 03:41:21.319 align:start position:0%
raised pardon us we're we're having a
 
03:41:24.229 --> 03:41:24.239 align:start position:0%
little technical difficulty in training
 
03:41:32.750 --> 03:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:35.830 --> 03:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
has Madam chair can you hear me now yes
 
03:41:38.469 --> 03:41:38.479 align:start position:0%
thank you sorry about the delay thank
 
03:41:40.229 --> 03:41:40.239 align:start position:0%
you madam chair members of the committee
 
03:41:41.670 --> 03:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
my name is Susan Adams and I'm the
 
03:41:43.030 --> 03:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
director of State Legislative and
 
03:41:44.630 --> 03:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
Regulatory Affairs for the American
 
03:41:47.189 --> 03:41:47.199 align:start position:0%
speech language hearing Association and
 
03:41:48.950 --> 03:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
I'm actually here to ask for amendments
 
03:41:50.990 --> 03:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
to this bill because the language that
 
03:41:53.790 --> 03:41:53.800 align:start position:0%
has been presented is not a language
 
03:41:55.670 --> 03:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
that has been agreed upon by all the
 
03:41:58.630 --> 03:41:58.640 align:start position:0%
parties involved and in fact there is no
 
03:42:01.630 --> 03:42:01.640 align:start position:0%
language that uh AMTA and Asha have
 
03:42:04.189 --> 03:42:04.199 align:start position:0%
agreed upon so the language presented to
 
03:42:07.429 --> 03:42:07.439 align:start position:0%
you as as being um agreed upon by all
 
03:42:10.469 --> 03:42:10.479 align:start position:0%
parties is is not true um
 
03:42:12.309 --> 03:42:12.319 align:start position:0%
Asha doesn't oppose the ler and
 
03:42:13.910 --> 03:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
regulation of Music therapists but we
 
03:42:15.550 --> 03:42:15.560 align:start position:0%
are concerned about infringement of
 
03:42:17.910 --> 03:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
scope of practice for speech language
 
03:42:19.910 --> 03:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
Pathologists um although a music
 
03:42:22.389 --> 03:42:22.399 align:start position:0%
therapist can and does treat individuals
 
03:42:24.670 --> 03:42:24.680 align:start position:0%
with communication disorders um they're
 
03:42:26.590 --> 03:42:26.600 align:start position:0%
not qualified to to treat the
 
03:42:28.389 --> 03:42:28.399 align:start position:0%
communication disorder itself which
 
03:42:30.149 --> 03:42:30.159 align:start position:0%
Falls solely under the scope of practice
 
03:42:30.159 --> 03:42:31.110 align:start position:0%
Falls solely under the scope of practice
of

03:42:31.110 --> 03:42:31.120 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:42:34.030 --> 03:42:34.040 align:start position:0%
slps slps are uniquely educated and
 
03:42:36.510 --> 03:42:36.520 align:start position:0%
trained to assess treat and uh assess
 
03:42:39.149 --> 03:42:39.159 align:start position:0%
and treat speech language swallowing
 
03:42:41.149 --> 03:42:41.159 align:start position:0%
cognitive medication disorders in
 
03:42:43.710 --> 03:42:43.720 align:start position:0%
children and adults these Services help
 
03:42:45.710 --> 03:42:45.720 align:start position:0%
children acquire language and enable
 
03:42:47.510 --> 03:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
people to recover essential skills to
 
03:42:48.950 --> 03:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
communicate about their health and
 
03:42:51.590 --> 03:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
safety to swallow adequate nutrition
 
03:42:53.510 --> 03:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
safely and to have sufficient attention
 
03:42:55.349 --> 03:42:55.359 align:start position:0%
memory and organizational skills to
 
03:42:57.590 --> 03:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
function in their environment we have
 
03:42:59.590 --> 03:42:59.600 align:start position:0%
worked with uh music therapists and
 
03:43:01.750 --> 03:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
other states to clarify this language so
 
03:43:03.710 --> 03:43:03.720 align:start position:0%
that it's clear that although they can
 
03:43:06.790 --> 03:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
contat can treat a uh individual with a
 
03:43:09.269 --> 03:43:09.279 align:start position:0%
communication disorder that work is is
 
03:43:10.469 --> 03:43:10.479 align:start position:0%
related to
 
03:43:13.030 --> 03:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
um communication skills and not treating
 
03:43:15.710 --> 03:43:15.720 align:start position:0%
the communication disorder itself I hope
 
03:43:17.710 --> 03:43:17.720 align:start position:0%
we can uh share language so that New
 
03:43:19.550 --> 03:43:19.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can include this also to
 
03:43:21.590 --> 03:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
ensure that there is no confusion as to
 
03:43:24.030 --> 03:43:24.040 align:start position:0%
which uh professionals provide which
 
03:43:26.149 --> 03:43:26.159 align:start position:0%

one representative
 
03:43:40.550 --> 03:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you madam chair good
 
03:43:43.429 --> 03:43:43.439 align:start position:0%
afternoon Miss Adams uh so uh I'm
 
03:43:45.309 --> 03:43:45.319 align:start position:0%
wondering whether the language that you
 
03:43:48.710 --> 03:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
are uh asking us to consider uh was
 
03:43:50.790 --> 03:43:50.800 align:start position:0%
offered to the senate in the course of
 
03:43:52.870 --> 03:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
the development of the
 
03:43:55.349 --> 03:43:55.359 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you representative Schmidt it
 
03:43:57.349 --> 03:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
has not been offered in the Senate yet
 
03:43:59.990 --> 03:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
because the language was just agreed to
 
03:44:02.070 --> 03:44:02.080 align:start position:0%
um in Maryland in the last couple of
 
03:44:05.550 --> 03:44:05.560 align:start position:0%
weeks so it was uh it occurred after the
 
03:44:07.309 --> 03:44:07.319 align:start position:0%
the Senate uh
 
03:44:10.670 --> 03:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
hearings followup followup
 
03:44:13.790 --> 03:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
when you say agreed to you mean that you
 
03:44:17.550 --> 03:44:17.560 align:start position:0%
and the music therapist organization
 
03:44:20.070 --> 03:44:20.080 align:start position:0%
your organization and theirs agreed to
 
03:44:22.110 --> 03:44:22.120 align:start position:0%
it uh that language in the state of
 
03:44:26.070 --> 03:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
Maryland yes thank
 
03:44:30.269 --> 03:44:30.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:33.149 --> 03:44:33.159 align:start position:0%
broa thank you Madame
 
03:44:35.950 --> 03:44:35.960 align:start position:0%
chair um I guess this question could go
 
03:44:40.349 --> 03:44:40.359 align:start position:0%
to either representative McGee or
 
03:44:42.990 --> 03:44:43.000 align:start position:0%
Miss Scott we had a subcommittee last
 
03:44:45.990 --> 03:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
year on this bill and we met and there
 
03:44:49.110 --> 03:44:49.120 align:start position:0%
was a woman um I believe her name was
 
03:44:51.710 --> 03:44:51.720 align:start position:0%
Miss chesterly who was a part of that
 
03:44:56.389 --> 03:44:56.399 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work and we had come to an
 
03:44:59.830 --> 03:44:59.840 align:start position:0%
agreement regarding an amendment on this
 
03:45:02.790 --> 03:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
bill so I wanted to know is this
 
03:45:05.429 --> 03:45:05.439 align:start position:0%
language that so I'm not sure if Miss
 
03:45:08.630 --> 03:45:08.640 align:start position:0%
Adams is is up to date on that so is
 
03:45:10.870 --> 03:45:10.880 align:start position:0%
this language
 
03:45:12.910 --> 03:45:12.920 align:start position:0%
that is being
 
03:45:19.510 --> 03:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:22.830 --> 03:45:22.840 align:start position:0%
that yes Scott you can you answer that
 
03:45:25.950 --> 03:45:25.960 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you um representative
 
03:45:29.070 --> 03:45:29.080 align:start position:0%
gry this language in this bill is
 
03:45:31.309 --> 03:45:31.319 align:start position:0%
directly pulled from our discussions in
 
03:45:34.229 --> 03:45:34.239 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee our subcommittee
 
03:45:37.670 --> 03:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
discussion result was that there's
 
03:45:39.790 --> 03:45:39.800 align:start position:0%
already a Prohibition against music
 
03:45:42.189 --> 03:45:42.199 align:start position:0%
therapists using um the or engaging in
 
03:45:44.269 --> 03:45:44.279 align:start position:0%
the practice of Audiology or Speech
 
03:45:48.229 --> 03:45:48.239 align:start position:0%
Pathology it's in their lure um it's in
 
03:45:50.510 --> 03:45:50.520 align:start position:0%
their scope of practice under their RSA
 
03:45:52.630 --> 03:45:52.640 align:start position:0%
that prohibits anyone from doing
 
03:45:54.790 --> 03:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
anything in the such where they would be
 
03:45:57.990 --> 03:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
C doing their scope of practice and so
 
03:45:59.830 --> 03:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
it would be it would be redundant and
 
03:46:01.910 --> 03:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
repetitive to put it in our bill as well
 
03:46:04.110 --> 03:46:04.120 align:start position:0%
and so it was agreed upon in the
 
03:46:06.590 --> 03:46:06.600 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meetings that it was not
 
03:46:08.590 --> 03:46:08.600 align:start position:0%
necessary to put it in this bill because
 
03:46:10.990 --> 03:46:11.000 align:start position:0%
it's already in their bill that you
 
03:46:13.550 --> 03:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
cannot act as a speech or
 
03:46:16.990 --> 03:46:17.000 align:start position:0%
audiologist sorry a follow up
 
03:46:19.710 --> 03:46:19.720 align:start position:0%
please so miss Adams this language that
 
03:46:21.630 --> 03:46:21.640 align:start position:0%
you're referring to as an
 
03:46:25.349 --> 03:46:25.359 align:start position:0%
amendment describes ex what per
 
03:46:28.149 --> 03:46:28.159 align:start position:0%
se uh it makes it clear in the music
 
03:46:30.510 --> 03:46:30.520 align:start position:0%
therapist Practice Act uh which would
 
03:46:32.189 --> 03:46:32.199 align:start position:0%
likely be the only one that a music
 
03:46:34.790 --> 03:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
therapist would read um that they are
 
03:46:37.510 --> 03:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
not uh able to treat a communication
 
03:46:37.520 --> 03:46:38.590 align:start position:0%
not uh able to treat a communication
disorder

03:46:38.590 --> 03:46:38.600 align:start position:0%
disorder
 
03:46:38.600 --> 03:46:41.229 align:start position:0%
disorder
itself

03:46:41.229 --> 03:46:41.239 align:start position:0%
itself
 
03:46:48.309 --> 03:46:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:50.429 --> 03:46:50.439 align:start position:0%
questions is there anyone else who
 
03:46:56.910 --> 03:46:56.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:00.229 --> 03:47:00.239 align:start position:0%
six I I have a a question will miss
 
03:47:04.269 --> 03:47:04.279 align:start position:0%
Adams make that language available to
 
03:47:07.550 --> 03:47:07.560 align:start position:0%
us yes absolutely I will send it to the
 
03:47:11.229 --> 03:47:11.239 align:start position:0%
committee chair if that works yes
 
03:47:38.510 --> 03:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:38.520 --> 03:47:44.990 align:start position:0%
 
Kelly

03:47:44.990 --> 03:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:46.550 --> 03:47:46.560 align:start position:0%
you should be able to unmute yourself
 
03:47:46.560 --> 03:47:57.750 align:start position:0%
you should be able to unmute yourself
Miss

03:47:57.750 --> 03:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:01.189 --> 03:48:01.199 align:start position:0%
Kelly okay can you hear me now yes
 
03:48:04.910 --> 03:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
indeed good afternoon I'm Tina Kelly I'm
 
03:48:06.670 --> 03:48:06.680 align:start position:0%
appearing before you on behalf of the
 
03:48:10.990 --> 03:48:11.000 align:start position:0%
office of professional lure and certific
 
03:48:14.590 --> 03:48:14.600 align:start position:0%
um oplc does not oppose nor support this
 
03:48:17.309 --> 03:48:17.319 align:start position:0%
bill but we do however have some
 
03:48:19.590 --> 03:48:19.600 align:start position:0%
concerns and I believe I've testified to
 
03:48:19.600 --> 03:48:20.469 align:start position:0%
concerns and I believe I've testified to
these

03:48:20.469 --> 03:48:20.479 align:start position:0%
these
 
03:48:23.429 --> 03:48:23.439 align:start position:0%
before but um one of the concerns is
 
03:48:27.670 --> 03:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
that on page 38 line 11 it adds those
 
03:48:30.670 --> 03:48:30.680 align:start position:0%
definitions listed there to RSA
 
03:48:33.590 --> 03:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
328 those specific definitions should
 
03:48:37.950 --> 03:48:37.960 align:start position:0%
remain solely in RSA 326m the proposed
 
03:48:41.830 --> 03:48:41.840 align:start position:0%
legislation because if it's put into the
 
03:48:44.550 --> 03:48:44.560 align:start position:0%
um Allied Health law they would
 
03:48:46.830 --> 03:48:46.840 align:start position:0%
significantly significantly change the
 
03:48:48.830 --> 03:48:48.840 align:start position:0%
meaning for the other Allied Health
 
03:48:51.790 --> 03:48:51.800 align:start position:0%
boards the appropriate changes are
 
03:48:55.149 --> 03:48:55.159 align:start position:0%
described on page 40 in line 22 and
 
03:48:57.269 --> 03:48:57.279 align:start position:0%
those are being
 
03:49:00.630 --> 03:49:00.640 align:start position:0%
added the second thing is that this bill
 
03:49:03.550 --> 03:49:03.560 align:start position:0%
is being added to the LA Health boards
 
03:49:05.830 --> 03:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
which are fully autonomous boards
 
03:49:08.309 --> 03:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
receiving administrative support from
 
03:49:08.319 --> 03:49:09.950 align:start position:0%
receiving administrative support from
oplc

03:49:09.950 --> 03:49:09.960 align:start position:0%
oplc
 
03:49:13.950 --> 03:49:13.960 align:start position:0%
on page 40 line 14 it states under Roman
 
03:49:17.070 --> 03:49:17.080 align:start position:0%
numeral 3 the executive director shall
 
03:49:19.990 --> 03:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
seek and seek the advice of the board
 
03:49:22.910 --> 03:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
for issues related to the regulation of
 
03:49:22.920 --> 03:49:23.950 align:start position:0%
for issues related to the regulation of
Music

03:49:23.950 --> 03:49:23.960 align:start position:0%
Music
 
03:49:26.269 --> 03:49:26.279 align:start position:0%
therapists because of this requirement
 
03:49:28.630 --> 03:49:28.640 align:start position:0%
under their duties it's unclear whether
 
03:49:30.910 --> 03:49:30.920 align:start position:0%
this is meant to be an autonomous board
 
03:49:33.590 --> 03:49:33.600 align:start position:0%
or an Advisory
 
03:49:36.389 --> 03:49:36.399 align:start position:0%
board and the last thing I'll add is
 
03:49:38.910 --> 03:49:38.920 align:start position:0%
that we wanted to be sure that on page
 
03:49:42.149 --> 03:49:42.159 align:start position:0%
41 and it creates a new position if this
 
03:49:45.790 --> 03:49:45.800 align:start position:0%
um legislation were to pass and oplc
 
03:49:48.189 --> 03:49:48.199 align:start position:0%
would definitely need that position
 
03:49:50.630 --> 03:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
although there wouldn't be a a lot of
 
03:49:52.790 --> 03:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
these um of
 
03:49:55.630 --> 03:49:55.640 align:start position:0%
lenses there would be there's much more
 
03:49:57.790 --> 03:49:57.800 align:start position:0%
that goes into administering a board
 
03:49:59.830 --> 03:49:59.840 align:start position:0%
development and Main maintenance of
 
03:49:59.840 --> 03:50:00.870 align:start position:0%
development and Main maintenance of
rules

03:50:00.870 --> 03:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
rules
 
03:50:03.630 --> 03:50:03.640 align:start position:0%
meetings um replying to questions of the
 
03:50:05.990 --> 03:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
lenses in the public maintenance of a
 
03:50:08.630 --> 03:50:08.640 align:start position:0%
database so if this does go through we
 
03:50:10.910 --> 03:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
would definitely need that
 
03:50:13.630 --> 03:50:13.640 align:start position:0%
position um this is all I have at the
 
03:50:15.510 --> 03:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
this time if you have any questions I'd
 
03:50:18.790 --> 03:50:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:22.110 --> 03:50:22.120 align:start position:0%
them repr bro you have a
 
03:50:24.750 --> 03:50:24.760 align:start position:0%
question thank you uh Miss Kelly in
 
03:50:26.550 --> 03:50:26.560 align:start position:0%
regard to the new
 
03:50:30.510 --> 03:50:30.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:35.429 --> 03:50:35.439 align:start position:0%
um won't all or organizations that that
 
03:50:38.950 --> 03:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
U all new organizations in oplc have the
 
03:50:42.910 --> 03:50:42.920 align:start position:0%
same requirement so that we wouldn't how
 
03:50:45.110 --> 03:50:45.120 align:start position:0%
is it that does that mean that for every
 
03:50:48.990 --> 03:50:49.000 align:start position:0%
every new um group that we that was
 
03:50:51.830 --> 03:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
brought under oplc you need a new
 
03:50:54.830 --> 03:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
position to initiate all those changes
 
03:50:57.750 --> 03:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
not necessarily but in this case
 
03:51:01.830 --> 03:51:01.840 align:start position:0%
we we've added so much to our staff that
 
03:51:04.590 --> 03:51:04.600 align:start position:0%
are already doing the licensing that at
 
03:51:07.670 --> 03:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
some point it becomes um Although our
 
03:51:09.870 --> 03:51:09.880 align:start position:0%
staff does a great job that just
 
03:51:12.189 --> 03:51:12.199 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed with the amount of lenses so
 
03:51:15.030 --> 03:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
adding a even a little bit more is just
 
03:51:17.229 --> 03:51:17.239 align:start position:0%
going to create that much more work and
 
03:51:19.389 --> 03:51:19.399 align:start position:0%
at some point every little bit becomes
 
03:51:19.399 --> 03:51:21.189 align:start position:0%
at some point every little bit becomes
UNS

03:51:21.189 --> 03:51:21.199 align:start position:0%
UNS
 
03:51:25.469 --> 03:51:25.479 align:start position:0%
sustainable yes represent brotto in if
 
03:51:29.070 --> 03:51:29.080 align:start position:0%
the board already exists and is moved to
 
03:51:32.349 --> 03:51:32.359 align:start position:0%
oplc IT staff would move with it this is
 
03:51:34.670 --> 03:51:34.680 align:start position:0%
a brand new board
 
03:51:38.149 --> 03:51:38.159 align:start position:0%
so their position is that they need
 
03:51:38.159 --> 03:51:40.790 align:start position:0%
so their position is that they need
staff

03:51:40.790 --> 03:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
staff
 
03:51:43.710 --> 03:51:43.720 align:start position:0%

03:51:57.750 --> 03:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
be likely to apply for lure under this
 
03:52:00.149 --> 03:52:00.159 align:start position:0%
um grouping we were discussing the house
 
03:52:02.389 --> 03:52:02.399 align:start position:0%
bill it was between 30 and
 
03:52:08.070 --> 03:52:08.080 align:start position:0%

03:54:27.309 --> 03:54:27.319 align:start position:0%
the yes certainly this is more technical
 
03:54:32.510 --> 03:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
cleanup on the oplc this deals with
 
03:54:36.429 --> 03:54:36.439 align:start position:0%
hearings the the administration of
 
03:54:40.910 --> 03:54:40.920 align:start position:0%
hearings and uh application procedures
 
03:54:44.229 --> 03:54:44.239 align:start position:0%

03:54:48.550 --> 03:54:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:52.429 --> 03:54:52.439 align:start position:0%
department again this is a lot of very
 
03:54:55.229 --> 03:54:55.239 align:start position:0%
fine print that we will be examining
 
03:55:02.469 --> 03:55:02.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:05.429 --> 03:55:05.439 align:start position:0%
morning I believe it is
 
03:55:08.550 --> 03:55:08.560 align:start position:0%
all essentially duplicative to existing
 
03:55:11.910 --> 03:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
one law except that it
 
03:55:14.349 --> 03:55:14.359 align:start position:0%
consolidates these activities under the
 
03:55:18.189 --> 03:55:18.199 align:start position:0%
oplc rather than each individual
 
03:55:22.469 --> 03:55:22.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:27.830 --> 03:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:32.070 --> 03:55:32.080 align:start position:0%
groa thank you Mr chair um is this then

similar to house
 
03:55:37.389 --> 03:55:37.399 align:start position:0%
bill is it 58 the one that that Senator
 
03:55:40.550 --> 03:55:40.560 align:start position:0%
Carson submitt that has
 
03:55:43.670 --> 03:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
similar that has a similar
 
03:55:47.750 --> 03:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
tone uh yes except that Senate Bill 58
 
03:55:50.429 --> 03:55:50.439 align:start position:0%
deals with different topics that are
 
03:55:53.469 --> 03:55:53.479 align:start position:0%
Consolidated that that deals with with
 
03:55:53.479 --> 03:55:54.870 align:start position:0%
Consolidated that that deals with with
application

03:55:54.870 --> 03:55:54.880 align:start position:0%
application
 
03:55:58.910 --> 03:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
procedures um this one deals with Ru
 
03:56:02.110 --> 03:56:02.120 align:start position:0%
rule making investigations and hearings
 
03:56:04.510 --> 03:56:04.520 align:start position:0%
and appeals which are not covered in
 
03:56:08.550 --> 03:56:08.560 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 58 but the the intent is the
 
03:56:08.560 --> 03:56:09.830 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 58 but the the intent is the
same

03:56:09.830 --> 03:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
same
 
03:56:09.840 --> 03:56:11.110 align:start position:0%
same

name is Mike Porter I'm an attorney I'm
 
03:57:06.630 --> 03:57:06.640 align:start position:0%
also the administrator of oplc
 
03:57:09.590 --> 03:57:09.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement um I had a long speech
 
03:57:11.110 --> 03:57:11.120 align:start position:0%
prepared but I'm gonna I'm gonna reduce
 
03:57:12.790 --> 03:57:12.800 align:start position:0%
it because I know you folks have have
 
03:57:15.510 --> 03:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
sat through a lot of testimony today um
 
03:57:17.269 --> 03:57:17.279 align:start position:0%
but I do want to discuss the primary
 
03:57:20.189 --> 03:57:20.199 align:start position:0%
functions of oplc which as you all know
 
03:57:22.550 --> 03:57:22.560 align:start position:0%
is to strengthen the workforce in New
 
03:57:24.070 --> 03:57:24.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire through ease of access of
 
03:57:24.080 --> 03:57:25.269 align:start position:0%
Hampshire through ease of access of
professional

03:57:25.269 --> 03:57:25.279 align:start position:0%
professional
 
03:57:28.110 --> 03:57:28.120 align:start position:0%
lure second uh through the enforcement
 
03:57:29.910 --> 03:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
of statutes and rules governing
 
03:57:32.670 --> 03:57:32.680 align:start position:0%
professional lure our mission is to
 
03:57:35.070 --> 03:57:35.080 align:start position:0%
protect the health uh the health safety
 
03:57:37.870 --> 03:57:37.880 align:start position:0%
and Welfare uh of the public while also
 
03:57:40.229 --> 03:57:40.239 align:start position:0%
balancing the D process protections of
 
03:57:40.239 --> 03:57:41.670 align:start position:0%
balancing the D process protections of
professional

03:57:41.670 --> 03:57:41.680 align:start position:0%
professional
 
03:57:44.870 --> 03:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
lenses um the reason we have put this
 
03:57:48.189 --> 03:57:48.199 align:start position:0%
forward to you is currently we have 55
 
03:57:51.750 --> 03:57:51.760 align:start position:0%
boards commissions uh or councils
 
03:57:54.149 --> 03:57:54.159 align:start position:0%
combined and right now we operate under
 
03:57:57.750 --> 03:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
55 different sets of statutes and rules
 
03:58:02.790 --> 03:58:02.800 align:start position:0%
um this has proven to be a tremendous uh
 
03:58:05.469 --> 03:58:05.479 align:start position:0%
I guess uh undertaking when when trying
 
03:58:08.950 --> 03:58:08.960 align:start position:0%
to follow a complaint process uh through
 
03:58:11.510 --> 03:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
final adjudication and I I want to tell
 
03:58:14.429 --> 03:58:14.439 align:start position:0%
you that since October 2020 uh the
 
03:58:16.550 --> 03:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
senior leadership team we've met and
 
03:58:18.630 --> 03:58:18.640 align:start position:0%
continue to meet with all the boards to
 
03:58:20.349 --> 03:58:20.359 align:start position:0%
review a more efficient and effective
 
03:58:23.269 --> 03:58:23.279 align:start position:0%
complaint process um as a result of
 
03:58:24.910 --> 03:58:24.920 align:start position:0%
these meetings a number of boards have
 
03:58:27.670 --> 03:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
signed on to um a new complaint process
 
03:58:29.670 --> 03:58:29.680 align:start position:0%
through standing orders these standing
 
03:58:31.110 --> 03:58:31.120 align:start position:0%
orders do allow complaints to be
 
03:58:33.590 --> 03:58:33.600 align:start position:0%
centrally processed reviewed and
 
03:58:35.590 --> 03:58:35.600 align:start position:0%
submitted uh to the
 
03:58:39.110 --> 03:58:39.120 align:start position:0%
boards uh at an early stage uh
 
03:58:41.830 --> 03:58:41.840 align:start position:0%
which then brings the final decision a
 
03:58:43.550 --> 03:58:43.560 align:start position:0%
lot sooner than in the past and I can
 
03:58:46.389 --> 03:58:46.399 align:start position:0%
tell you in the past we have had some
 
03:58:49.910 --> 03:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
cases range anywhere from one to three
 
03:58:52.630 --> 03:58:52.640 align:start position:0%
years um we feel that that does not
 
03:58:54.950 --> 03:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
provide for an efficient or effective
 
03:58:57.870 --> 03:58:57.880 align:start position:0%
complaint processing system number one
 
03:58:59.870 --> 03:58:59.880 align:start position:0%
for those members of the public who have
 
03:59:02.070 --> 03:59:02.080 align:start position:0%
legitimately filed a complaint but
 
03:59:05.750 --> 03:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
number two it also doesn't benefit the
 
03:59:08.910 --> 03:59:08.920 align:start position:0%
lensee to maybe be currently practicing
 
03:59:11.349 --> 03:59:11.359 align:start position:0%
for one two or three years only to have
 
03:59:13.910 --> 03:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
their case finally adjudicated and then
 
03:59:16.750 --> 03:59:16.760 align:start position:0%
some sort of administrative discipline
 
03:59:19.510 --> 03:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
issued so the proposed statutory changes
 
03:59:21.349 --> 03:59:21.359 align:start position:0%
to the enforcement process does provide
 
03:59:23.950 --> 03:59:23.960 align:start position:0%
the consistency and efficiency uh from
 
03:59:25.710 --> 03:59:25.720 align:start position:0%
the filing of an initial complaint all
 
03:59:28.189 --> 03:59:28.199 align:start position:0%
the way to final adjudication there are
 
03:59:30.510 --> 03:59:30.520 align:start position:0%
no two cases that are alike uh the
 
03:59:33.269 --> 03:59:33.279 align:start position:0%
manner in we in in which each case is
 
03:59:36.710 --> 03:59:36.720 align:start position:0%
handled um should be similar and again
 
03:59:37.870 --> 03:59:37.880 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned under the current
 
03:59:40.349 --> 03:59:40.359 align:start position:0%
statutory scheme each board has a unique
 
03:59:44.189 --> 03:59:44.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:46.269 --> 03:59:46.279 align:start position:0%
complaints one of the central issues
 
03:59:48.189 --> 03:59:48.199 align:start position:0%
that we find
 
03:59:50.750 --> 03:59:50.760 align:start position:0%
um particularly bothersome is on the
 
03:59:53.510 --> 03:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
final adjudication of complaints uh as I
 
03:59:55.469 --> 03:59:55.479 align:start position:0%
said so in the past when a border
 
03:59:57.189 --> 03:59:57.199 align:start position:0%
commission or Council issues a notice of
 
03:59:59.790 --> 03:59:59.800 align:start position:0%
hearing the parties engage in settlement
 
04:00:02.630 --> 04:00:02.640 align:start position:0%
negotiations unfortunately some of these
 
04:00:04.269 --> 04:00:04.279 align:start position:0%
cases may not be resolved through either
 
04:00:06.590 --> 04:00:06.600 align:start position:0%
settlement or fral adjudication ranging
 
04:00:08.950 --> 04:00:08.960 align:start position:0%
anywhere from one to three years we are
 
04:00:10.269 --> 04:00:10.279 align:start position:0%
currently working on a process
 
04:00:12.710 --> 04:00:12.720 align:start position:0%
internally where if a board requests a
 
04:00:15.870 --> 04:00:15.880 align:start position:0%
matter for adjudication we have 60 days
 
04:00:18.510 --> 04:00:18.520 align:start position:0%
from the date that they request that to
 
04:00:20.630 --> 04:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
settle the matter and if it's not
 
04:00:23.070 --> 04:00:23.080 align:start position:0%
settled on day 60 we then issue the
 
04:00:25.830 --> 04:00:25.840 align:start position:0%
notice of hearing and the the matter is
 
04:00:28.110 --> 04:00:28.120 align:start position:0%
scheduled to be heard within 30
 
04:00:30.429 --> 04:00:30.439 align:start position:0%
days this places the matter before the
 
04:00:32.630 --> 04:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
boards commissions and Council councils
 
04:00:34.429 --> 04:00:34.439 align:start position:0%
within what we believe is a reasonable
 
04:00:37.389 --> 04:00:37.399 align:start position:0%
time period resulting in the issuance of
 
04:00:39.790 --> 04:00:39.800 align:start position:0%
final determination of complaints in a
 
04:00:42.910 --> 04:00:42.920 align:start position:0%
timely efficient and effective
 
04:00:46.830 --> 04:00:46.840 align:start position:0%
manner what's primary here as well is
 
04:00:48.269 --> 04:00:48.279 align:start position:0%
throughout all of these changes that
 
04:00:51.229 --> 04:00:51.239 align:start position:0%
we've made there and I and I need to be
 
04:00:53.630 --> 04:00:53.640 align:start position:0%
crystal clear the boards are not
 
04:00:56.950 --> 04:00:56.960 align:start position:0%
relinquishing any rights Power Authority
 
04:00:59.510 --> 04:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
or any of that nature every board
 
04:01:01.630 --> 04:01:01.640 align:start position:0%
commission and councel has absolute
 
04:01:05.309 --> 04:01:05.319 align:start position:0%
final say on every case that any

board
 
04:01:10.590 --> 04:01:10.600 align:start position:0%
many of the boards and commissions and
 
04:01:12.750 --> 04:01:12.760 align:start position:0%
councils have as I mentioned been
 
04:01:14.710 --> 04:01:14.720 align:start position:0%
utilizing this streamline process
 
04:01:16.830 --> 04:01:16.840 align:start position:0%
through standing orders currently the

barbering cosmetology and Aesthetics
 
04:01:24.110 --> 04:01:24.120 align:start position:0%
accountancy and many more are following
 
04:01:26.630 --> 04:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
this since we started this enforcement
 
04:01:30.149 --> 04:01:30.159 align:start position:0%
division in September 1st of 2020 we
 
04:01:32.670 --> 04:01:32.680 align:start position:0%
have processed
 
04:01:36.510 --> 04:01:36.520 align:start position:0%
1,198 complaints of these nearly 2,000
 
04:01:39.950 --> 04:01:39.960 align:start position:0%
cases we've also handled 22 emergency
 
04:01:41.550 --> 04:01:41.560 align:start position:0%
suspensions for matters involving
 
04:01:43.110 --> 04:01:43.120 align:start position:0%
imminent danger to the public health
 
04:01:47.070 --> 04:01:47.080 align:start position:0%
safety and or welfare in addition to the
 
04:01:49.110 --> 04:01:49.120 align:start position:0%
emergency suspensions we've handled a
 
04:01:51.269 --> 04:01:51.279 align:start position:0%
number of preliminary agreements not to
 
04:01:54.590 --> 04:01:54.600 align:start position:0%
practice that's in lie of a suspension
 
04:01:56.510 --> 04:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
um pending the outcome of an
 
04:01:58.790 --> 04:01:58.800 align:start position:0%
investigation all of this is an effort
 
04:02:01.269 --> 04:02:01.279 align:start position:0%
to protect the public health safety and
 
04:02:03.710 --> 04:02:03.720 align:start position:0%
Welfare the pros to the proposal are
 
04:02:06.670 --> 04:02:06.680 align:start position:0%
numerous but most important this process
 
04:02:08.469 --> 04:02:08.479 align:start position:0%
allows for the immediate protection of
 
04:02:10.670 --> 04:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
the public health safety and Welfare and
 
04:02:13.910 --> 04:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
by that what I mean is all complaints
 
04:02:15.750 --> 04:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
come through a centralized process we
 
04:02:17.750 --> 04:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
have two individuals that screen every
 
04:02:20.510 --> 04:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
single complaint they're trained to look
 
04:02:23.469 --> 04:02:23.479 align:start position:0%
for items that may be in imminent danger
 
04:02:25.630 --> 04:02:25.640 align:start position:0%
to the public health safety and Welfare
 
04:02:28.990 --> 04:02:29.000 align:start position:0%
they then bring that directly to me i t
 
04:02:31.750 --> 04:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
i review the matter pull up the statutes
 
04:02:33.750 --> 04:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
and rules right away and then I go to
 
04:02:36.670 --> 04:02:36.680 align:start position:0%
our chief prosecutor um this all happens
 
04:02:38.790 --> 04:02:38.800 align:start position:0%
literally within less than an hour's
 
04:02:40.950 --> 04:02:40.960 align:start position:0%
time if we deem at that point that
 
04:02:43.070 --> 04:02:43.080 align:start position:0%
there's an emergency where we have to
 
04:02:45.349 --> 04:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
emergently suspend a professional
 
04:02:48.189 --> 04:02:48.199 align:start position:0%
license we then R raise this level to
 
04:02:52.550 --> 04:02:52.560 align:start position:0%
the executive director who has final say
 
04:02:56.710 --> 04:02:56.720 align:start position:0%
um I want to reiterate that the boards
 
04:02:58.469 --> 04:02:58.479 align:start position:0%
commissions and councils throughout this
 
04:03:02.189 --> 04:03:02.199 align:start position:0%
entire process um have have no
 
04:03:04.149 --> 04:03:04.159 align:start position:0%
diminished authority of the of their of
 
04:03:06.429 --> 04:03:06.439 align:start position:0%
of the boards there's none uh they will
 
04:03:08.149 --> 04:03:08.159 align:start position:0%
have the ability to address matters and
 
04:03:10.510 --> 04:03:10.520 align:start position:0%
timely consistent and efficient manner
 
04:03:12.790 --> 04:03:12.800 align:start position:0%
all the while retaining jurisdiction
 
04:03:15.590 --> 04:03:15.600 align:start position:0%
over every case that comes before them I
 
04:03:16.870 --> 04:03:16.880 align:start position:0%
just want to give you a very brief
 
04:03:18.710 --> 04:03:18.720 align:start position:0%
sampling of some of the cases that we've
 
04:03:21.590 --> 04:03:21.600 align:start position:0%
handled since September 1st um which
 
04:03:24.510 --> 04:03:24.520 align:start position:0%
were the result of our initial screeners
 
04:03:27.030 --> 04:03:27.040 align:start position:0%
uh through this centralized process um
 
04:03:29.510 --> 04:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
in December 2020 we were made made aware
 
04:03:30.830 --> 04:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
of an individual engaged in the
 
04:03:33.309 --> 04:03:33.319 align:start position:0%
unlicensed practice of medicine whereby
 
04:03:35.149 --> 04:03:35.159 align:start position:0%
the individual had women expose
 
04:03:36.950 --> 04:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
themselves while he conducted
 
04:03:39.269 --> 04:03:39.279 align:start position:0%
examinations uh um the Board of Medicine
 
04:03:40.910 --> 04:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
does in fact have jurisdiction over
 
04:03:43.670 --> 04:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
unlicensed practice of medicine uh we
 
04:03:45.469 --> 04:03:45.479 align:start position:0%
were able to
 
04:03:48.429 --> 04:03:48.439 align:start position:0%
successfully prosecute that matter uh we
 
04:03:50.510 --> 04:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
investigated the matter in less than 30
 
04:03:53.830 --> 04:03:53.840 align:start position:0%
days um we adjudicated the matter before
 
04:03:56.149 --> 04:03:56.159 align:start position:0%
the Board of Medicine uh in March of
 
04:04:00.110 --> 04:04:00.120 align:start position:0%
this year uh utilizing our investigative
 
04:04:03.030 --> 04:04:03.040 align:start position:0%
staff and our prosecution division
 
04:04:04.710 --> 04:04:04.720 align:start position:0%
another matter we were made aware of I
 
04:04:07.070 --> 04:04:07.080 align:start position:0%
believe was October or November was a
 
04:04:08.910 --> 04:04:08.920 align:start position:0%
speech language path olist who engage in
 
04:04:10.510 --> 04:04:10.520 align:start position:0%
an assaul of behavior of a
 
04:04:12.670 --> 04:04:12.680 align:start position:0%
three-year-old Child by angrily
 
04:04:14.349 --> 04:04:14.359 align:start position:0%
suspending the child by his ankles
 
04:04:16.990 --> 04:04:17.000 align:start position:0%
inches above a school building floor and
 
04:04:18.830 --> 04:04:18.840 align:start position:0%
then proceeding to drag that child by
 
04:04:21.070 --> 04:04:21.080 align:start position:0%
the arm down a hallway we were
 
04:04:22.990 --> 04:04:23.000 align:start position:0%
immediately able to suspend the license
 
04:04:26.149 --> 04:04:26.159 align:start position:0%
of that leny and move forward with
 
04:04:29.149 --> 04:04:29.159 align:start position:0%
adjudication during the height of covid
 
04:04:30.670 --> 04:04:30.680 align:start position:0%
uh we received information of a
 
04:04:32.990 --> 04:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
pharmacist diverting a dose of madna
 
04:04:35.950 --> 04:04:35.960 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccine from a hospital we were
 
04:04:37.710 --> 04:04:37.720 align:start position:0%
able to secure a preliminary agreement
 
04:04:39.389 --> 04:04:39.399 align:start position:0%
not not to practice pending the outcome
 
04:04:40.790 --> 04:04:40.800 align:start position:0%
of an
 
04:04:43.349 --> 04:04:43.359 align:start position:0%
investigation in October of 2020 some of
 
04:04:45.429 --> 04:04:45.439 align:start position:0%
you may have heard about this case uh we
 
04:04:47.389 --> 04:04:47.399 align:start position:0%
were made aware of unsavory business
 
04:04:49.630 --> 04:04:49.640 align:start position:0%
practices of a for-profit post-secondary
 
04:04:51.950 --> 04:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
nursing school in Manchester which
 
04:04:54.950 --> 04:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
caused students uh enrolled with
 
04:04:57.510 --> 04:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
financial hardship within four days of
 
04:04:58.790 --> 04:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
receiving the initial complaint and
 
04:05:01.189 --> 04:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
Report through our investigation through
 
04:05:03.630 --> 04:05:03.640 align:start position:0%
our new streamline process we were able
 
04:05:05.590 --> 04:05:05.600 align:start position:0%
to immediately suspend the operation of
 
04:05:07.429 --> 04:05:07.439 align:start position:0%
the school to prevent further Financial
 
04:05:07.439 --> 04:05:09.149 align:start position:0%
the school to prevent further Financial
harm

04:05:09.149 --> 04:05:09.159 align:start position:0%
harm
 
04:05:11.229 --> 04:05:11.239 align:start position:0%
more important at final adjudication the
 
04:05:13.110 --> 04:05:13.120 align:start position:0%
Board of Nursing revoked the for-profit
 
04:05:14.870 --> 04:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
school's authority to practice in New
 
04:05:16.830 --> 04:05:16.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thereby permanently
 
04:05:18.590 --> 04:05:18.600 align:start position:0%
safeguarding students from further
 
04:05:20.990 --> 04:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
Financial harm and another one more
 
04:05:23.910 --> 04:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
recently involved another licensed
 
04:05:26.550 --> 04:05:26.560 align:start position:0%
professional uh who the allegation was
 
04:05:29.670 --> 04:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
engaged in possible sexual assault on a
 
04:05:32.070 --> 04:05:32.080 align:start position:0%
client of theirs uh we immediately
 
04:05:33.750 --> 04:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
suspended the license notified the
 
04:05:36.389 --> 04:05:36.399 align:start position:0%
police department and as of last Sunday
 
04:05:38.070 --> 04:05:38.080 align:start position:0%
this individual was arrested on on
 
04:05:40.950 --> 04:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
aggravated fonia sexual assault this is
 
04:05:42.670 --> 04:05:42.680 align:start position:0%
just a small sampling of matters that
 
04:05:44.910 --> 04:05:44.920 align:start position:0%
we've pursued aggressively efficiently
 
04:05:47.030 --> 04:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
and effectively to protect the public
 
04:05:49.510 --> 04:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
health safety and Welfare all while also
 
04:05:52.149 --> 04:05:52.159 align:start position:0%
ensuring that the lenses du process
 
04:05:55.389 --> 04:05:55.399 align:start position:0%
protections are provided I also want to
 
04:05:57.309 --> 04:05:57.319 align:start position:0%
say one last comment about this
 
04:06:00.070 --> 04:06:00.080 align:start position:0%
particular Bill uh in the rule writing
 
04:06:03.590 --> 04:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
portion um it also brings unlicensed
 
04:06:05.870 --> 04:06:05.880 align:start position:0%
practice to all boards uh right now I
 
04:06:07.870 --> 04:06:07.880 align:start position:0%
believe we only have a handful Maybe
 
04:06:10.269 --> 04:06:10.279 align:start position:0%
maybe five boards total that actually
 
04:06:12.229 --> 04:06:12.239 align:start position:0%
have jurisdiction over unlicensed
 
04:06:14.910 --> 04:06:14.920 align:start position:0%
practice I can tell you about one case
 
04:06:17.870 --> 04:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
that uh is is uh going to be heard and
 
04:06:21.630 --> 04:06:21.640 align:start position:0%
involves U removal wrongful removal of
 
04:06:25.590 --> 04:06:25.600 align:start position:0%
escrow funds to the tune of about30 or
 
04:06:27.950 --> 04:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
$140,000 um these cases are cases that
 
04:06:30.870 --> 04:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
we are immediately able to engage in um
 
04:06:32.830 --> 04:06:32.840 align:start position:0%
and because of the ability to go after
 
04:06:35.070 --> 04:06:35.080 align:start position:0%
somebody like that we can prevent
 
04:06:38.309 --> 04:06:38.319 align:start position:0%
further harm we recently settled three
 
04:06:41.070 --> 04:06:41.080 align:start position:0%
unlicensed real estate practice cases
 
04:06:42.710 --> 04:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
where we were able to utilize the
 
04:06:44.910 --> 04:06:44.920 align:start position:0%
statutory language we could not
 
04:06:47.149 --> 04:06:47.159 align:start position:0%
determine the economic gain that the out
 
04:06:49.309 --> 04:06:49.319 align:start position:0%
ofst State Realtors gained but we were
 
04:06:52.550 --> 04:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
able to issue a $10,000 fine as a Max
 
04:06:54.149 --> 04:06:54.159 align:start position:0%
Fine to each
 
04:06:56.189 --> 04:06:56.199 align:start position:0%
individual these are just some of the
 
04:06:57.910 --> 04:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
processes that are identified in the
 
04:07:00.870 --> 04:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
bill and and uh I can tell you as
 
04:07:03.349 --> 04:07:03.359 align:start position:0%
someone who has been uh with this
 
04:07:04.990 --> 04:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement division since day one and
 
04:07:06.910 --> 04:07:06.920 align:start position:0%
helping build it we have seen a
 
04:07:08.790 --> 04:07:08.800 align:start position:0%
tremendous benefit to the public health
 
04:07:10.910 --> 04:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
safety and Welfare but we've also heard
 
04:07:13.070 --> 04:07:13.080 align:start position:0%
from the civil defense bar that they
 
04:07:14.790 --> 04:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
feel that their clients are being
 
04:07:18.189 --> 04:07:18.199 align:start position:0%
offered due process protections which uh
 
04:07:19.590 --> 04:07:19.600 align:start position:0%
they believe is a step in the right
 
04:07:22.070 --> 04:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
direction so with that I'm I'm
 
04:07:23.910 --> 04:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
submitting my testimony and I'm I'm
 
04:07:25.349 --> 04:07:25.359 align:start position:0%

o'clock
 
04:08:01.349 --> 04:08:01.359 align:start position:0%
any uh you there's a one of the things
 
04:08:03.830 --> 04:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
I'll develop then but I'll just tell you
 
04:08:08.229 --> 04:08:08.239 align:start position:0%
this is strange here the oplc
 
04:08:10.429 --> 04:08:10.439 align:start position:0%
is going after somebody who for
 
04:08:13.550 --> 04:08:13.560 align:start position:0%
aggravated fonus assault
 
04:08:17.030 --> 04:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
for a quack esy women to expose
 
04:08:19.790 --> 04:08:19.800 align:start position:0%
themselves Can You Reach people who
 
04:08:22.189 --> 04:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
aren't uh you're not police how do you
 
04:08:24.790 --> 04:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
reach people who aren't license I mean
 
04:08:26.309 --> 04:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
these are criminal offenses we're
 
04:08:26.319 --> 04:08:27.269 align:start position:0%
these are criminal offenses we're
talking

04:08:27.269 --> 04:08:27.279 align:start position:0%
talking
 
04:08:29.750 --> 04:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
about correct that's a great question
 
04:08:32.790 --> 04:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
and I will be brief um so with the um
 
04:08:35.269 --> 04:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
unlicensed uh practice of medicine that
 
04:08:38.429 --> 04:08:38.439 align:start position:0%
came in as a complaint um
 
04:08:40.269 --> 04:08:40.279 align:start position:0%
and we investigated it to determine
 
04:08:42.070 --> 04:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
whether we had jurisdiction under the
 
04:08:43.990 --> 04:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine statutes the Board of
 
04:08:47.189 --> 04:08:47.199 align:start position:0%
Medicine in fact can reach unlicensed
 
04:08:50.429 --> 04:08:50.439 align:start position:0%
individuals uh we can issue a a cease
 
04:08:54.590 --> 04:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
and desist U if found uh in violation of
 
04:08:56.830 --> 04:08:56.840 align:start position:0%
that statute uh the Board of Medicine
 
04:09:00.510 --> 04:09:00.520 align:start position:0%
can issue up to a $50,000 fine and it is
 
04:09:04.149 --> 04:09:04.159 align:start position:0%
also essentially a per se misdemeanor um
 
04:09:06.070 --> 04:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
in this particular matter when we
 
04:09:08.189 --> 04:09:08.199 align:start position:0%
received the ma that particular case we
 
04:09:10.429 --> 04:09:10.439 align:start position:0%
did make the referral to the appropriate
 
04:09:12.950 --> 04:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
police department at the same time um so
 
04:09:14.870 --> 04:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
that we could do a parallel
 
04:09:17.109 --> 04:09:17.119 align:start position:0%
investigation on the other individual
 
04:09:19.950 --> 04:09:19.960 align:start position:0%
with the aggravated fonia sexual assault
 
04:09:23.750 --> 04:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh that came in with a potential concern
 
04:09:25.510 --> 04:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
um of what we call unprofessional
 
04:09:27.990 --> 04:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
conduct under our statute when we were
 
04:09:30.229 --> 04:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
able to dig into uh the information a
 
04:09:33.030 --> 04:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
little bit deeper um not only did we
 
04:09:34.830 --> 04:09:34.840 align:start position:0%
suspend him but we immediately I
 
04:09:36.469 --> 04:09:36.479 align:start position:0%
personally contacted the Nashville
 
04:09:39.070 --> 04:09:39.080 align:start position:0%
Police Department that same day and made
 
04:09:41.149 --> 04:09:41.159 align:start position:0%
a report and handed over all the
 
04:09:44.030 --> 04:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
information that we had um so that we
 
04:09:46.429 --> 04:09:46.439 align:start position:0%
could make sure so they're parallel
 
04:09:49.030 --> 04:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
investigations um but we do have the
 
04:09:51.630 --> 04:09:51.640 align:start position:0%
authority on several boards to reach out
 
04:09:54.309 --> 04:09:54.319 align:start position:0%
to unlicensed
 
04:09:57.950 --> 04:09:57.960 align:start position:0%
practice thank youve done 90% of my
 
04:10:01.469 --> 04:10:01.479 align:start position:0%
interest thank you representative
 
04:10:05.510 --> 04:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
Shu thank you Mr chair uh so Mr Porter
 
04:10:08.349 --> 04:10:08.359 align:start position:0%
is it fair to say that if someone is
 
04:10:12.070 --> 04:10:12.080 align:start position:0%
doing a criminal activity in addition to
 
04:10:15.309 --> 04:10:15.319 align:start position:0%
unlicensed practice uh you could take
 
04:10:17.750 --> 04:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
immediate steps whereas criminal
 
04:10:20.630 --> 04:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
prosecution would be a much longer
 
04:10:23.510 --> 04:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
process uh that is correct and and and
 
04:10:25.469 --> 04:10:25.479 align:start position:0%
and I do want to mention this we had
 
04:10:28.309 --> 04:10:28.319 align:start position:0%
recently received a report of a nurse
 
04:10:30.269 --> 04:10:30.279 align:start position:0%
who broke the fingers of an elderly
 
04:10:33.510 --> 04:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
patient in a long-term care facility um
 
04:10:35.590 --> 04:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
we were notified the day of the arrest
 
04:10:37.910 --> 04:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
but you know that person could make bail
 
04:10:39.469 --> 04:10:39.479 align:start position:0%
and potentially work in that profession
 
04:10:41.429 --> 04:10:41.439 align:start position:0%
again we immediately suspended that
 
04:10:44.269 --> 04:10:44.279 align:start position:0%
person's license I think uh we received
 
04:10:48.309 --> 04:10:48.319 align:start position:0%
the report at 409m by 5:15 pm that
 
04:10:50.670 --> 04:10:50.680 align:start position:0%
person's license was suspended um and
 
04:10:52.269 --> 04:10:52.279 align:start position:0%
she just entered into a preliminary
 
04:10:55.309 --> 04:10:55.319 align:start position:0%
agreement not to practice uh which under
 
04:10:57.070 --> 04:10:57.080 align:start position:0%
emergency suspensions they have the
 
04:10:59.389 --> 04:10:59.399 align:start position:0%
right to be heard within 10 days but
 
04:11:00.990 --> 04:11:01.000 align:start position:0%
under a preliminary agreement not to
 
04:11:02.870 --> 04:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
practice it extends it out so that we
 
04:11:05.429 --> 04:11:05.439 align:start position:0%
can conduct our complete
 
04:11:08.590 --> 04:11:08.600 align:start position:0%
investigation thank you thank
 
04:11:13.750 --> 04:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:15.830 --> 04:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr
 
04:11:19.269 --> 04:11:19.279 align:start position:0%
chairman uh my question involves um you
 
04:11:22.109 --> 04:11:22.119 align:start position:0%
know the the the bulk of what we're
 
04:11:24.469 --> 04:11:24.479 align:start position:0%
talking about in reference to to this m
 
04:11:26.269 --> 04:11:26.279 align:start position:0%
this massive thing that the Senate has
 
04:11:28.790 --> 04:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
sent us and that is with with your
 
04:11:31.109 --> 04:11:31.119 align:start position:0%
investigative part of things and and the
 
04:11:33.510 --> 04:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
look that you guys give to these
 
04:11:35.870 --> 04:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
situations would you expect that a New
 
04:11:38.269 --> 04:11:38.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire license e that was having a
 
04:11:41.109 --> 04:11:41.119 align:start position:0%
problem in say Arizona come before your
 
04:11:41.119 --> 04:11:43.429 align:start position:0%
problem in say Arizona come before your
investigative

04:11:43.429 --> 04:11:43.439 align:start position:0%
investigative
 
04:11:46.269 --> 04:11:46.279 align:start position:0%
team and they would handle that or you
 
04:11:48.149 --> 04:11:48.159 align:start position:0%
would handle that and then vice versa if
 
04:11:49.910 --> 04:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
we had a if we had someone from
 
04:11:51.510 --> 04:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania practicing in New Hampshire
 
04:11:53.349 --> 04:11:53.359 align:start position:0%
would you expect the investigation would
 
04:11:55.910 --> 04:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
be solely conducted by you or would this
 
04:11:57.269 --> 04:11:57.279 align:start position:0%
involve the jurisdiction with the
 
04:11:59.710 --> 04:11:59.720 align:start position:0%
primary license he operates
 
04:12:02.429 --> 04:12:02.439 align:start position:0%
from that is a loaded question so I'll
 
04:12:05.510 --> 04:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you this um we will cooperate
 
04:12:08.950 --> 04:12:08.960 align:start position:0%
with any other uh licensing body and so
 
04:12:10.710 --> 04:12:10.720 align:start position:0%
for example we had a situation with a
 
04:12:14.229 --> 04:12:14.239 align:start position:0%
hospital in Boston Massachusetts where
 
04:12:15.990 --> 04:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
the individual was there on a on a
 
04:12:18.670 --> 04:12:18.680 align:start position:0%
temporary license uh we held the
 
04:12:21.670 --> 04:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
permanent license and so they reported
 
04:12:24.790 --> 04:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
to us U the the the issue and we
 
04:12:27.030 --> 04:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
conducted the well Massachusetts is
 
04:12:28.870 --> 04:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
conducting their investigation but
 
04:12:30.469 --> 04:12:30.479 align:start position:0%
because of the report we're doing a
 
04:12:30.479 --> 04:12:32.030 align:start position:0%
because of the report we're doing a
simultaneous

04:12:32.030 --> 04:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
simultaneous
 
04:12:34.550 --> 04:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
investigation if a New Hampshire Len he
 
04:12:37.590 --> 04:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
engages a misconduct in another state um
 
04:12:39.630 --> 04:12:39.640 align:start position:0%
and we do find out about it we
 
04:12:41.670 --> 04:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
absolutely have the jurisdiction under
 
04:12:44.269 --> 04:12:44.279 align:start position:0%
our statutes uh to conduct an
 
04:12:47.710 --> 04:12:47.720 align:start position:0%
investigation to ensure that no statutes
 
04:12:50.389 --> 04:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
of ours were violated if a statute is
 
04:12:53.030 --> 04:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
different in another state than ours uh
 
04:12:55.030 --> 04:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
we haven't re we haven't crossed that
 
04:12:58.229 --> 04:12:58.239 align:start position:0%
bridge yet um but if we do we would also
 
04:13:01.870 --> 04:13:01.880 align:start position:0%
probably seek guidance from our general
 
04:13:05.710 --> 04:13:05.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:09.109 --> 04:13:09.119 align:start position:0%
that one second chair have a follow
 
04:13:11.790 --> 04:13:11.800 align:start position:0%
follow thank
 
04:13:15.750 --> 04:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
you so so basically you know as a
 
04:13:17.670 --> 04:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
general rule there's got to be one group
 
04:13:19.790 --> 04:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
of people that that are in charge here
 
04:13:21.590 --> 04:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
so has this been worked out with these
 
04:13:24.590 --> 04:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
compacts are you aware of how this how
 
04:13:26.550 --> 04:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
this handles you know when the when
 
04:13:29.950 --> 04:13:29.960 align:start position:0%
these situations come down as far as who
 
04:13:31.870 --> 04:13:31.880 align:start position:0%
actually is the lead because because
 
04:13:34.910 --> 04:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
that needs to be defined If It Isn't So
 
04:13:37.550 --> 04:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
yeah if if the violation occurs in the
 
04:13:40.269 --> 04:13:40.279 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire we are the lead
 
04:13:42.269 --> 04:13:42.279 align:start position:0%
um and what happen and I can I'll
 
04:13:44.790 --> 04:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
explain it under the nursing uh Practice
 
04:13:47.630 --> 04:13:47.640 align:start position:0%
Act that's the largest compact lure I
 
04:13:50.149 --> 04:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
believe that we have um we have
 
04:13:53.870 --> 04:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
individuals here who might engage in uh
 
04:13:56.590 --> 04:13:56.600 align:start position:0%
unprofessional conduct we will take the
 
04:13:59.550 --> 04:13:59.560 align:start position:0%
investigative lead um if we deem that
 
04:14:02.750 --> 04:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
that conduct does rise to the level of
 
04:14:05.349 --> 04:14:05.359 align:start position:0%
violation we will notify the home state
 
04:14:08.469 --> 04:14:08.479 align:start position:0%
as well because what happens is a nurse
 
04:14:10.790 --> 04:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
here on a multi-state compact for
 
04:14:14.030 --> 04:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
example um we under the under the the
 
04:14:16.109 --> 04:14:16.119 align:start position:0%
compact lure and I forget which section
 
04:14:19.309 --> 04:14:19.319 align:start position:0%
it is I can visualize it but uh we have
 
04:14:23.550 --> 04:14:23.560 align:start position:0%
the primary ability to to investigate
 
04:14:25.309 --> 04:14:25.319 align:start position:0%
and hold accountable by the way even
 
04:14:26.790 --> 04:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
though they're it's a multi-state
 
04:14:30.070 --> 04:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
license but once we once we've reached
 
04:14:32.269 --> 04:14:32.279 align:start position:0%
that adjudication stage or even prior to
 
04:14:35.630 --> 04:14:35.640 align:start position:0%
if we deem it to be emergent we not only
 
04:14:38.109 --> 04:14:38.119 align:start position:0%
will report to nurses or the National
 
04:14:40.070 --> 04:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
Practitioner database but we will
 
04:14:42.990 --> 04:14:43.000 align:start position:0%
actually contact the home state directly
 
04:14:45.030 --> 04:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
just to make sure that there's no
 
04:14:47.030 --> 04:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
misinformation or there's no cross
 
04:14:49.870 --> 04:14:49.880 align:start position:0%
signals um because in some cases we've
 
04:14:53.189 --> 04:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
actually had some nurses who one case in
 
04:14:55.590 --> 04:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
particular was kind of a catch me if you
 
04:14:58.429 --> 04:14:58.439 align:start position:0%
can uh well we caught her um she was up
 
04:15:01.349 --> 04:15:01.359 align:start position:0%
here but lived down south uh we
 
04:15:04.510 --> 04:15:04.520 align:start position:0%
emergently suspended her and she
 
04:15:07.349 --> 04:15:07.359 align:start position:0%
essentially ignored us until I believe
 
04:15:08.950 --> 04:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
she had a knock on her door from her
 
04:15:12.990 --> 04:15:13.000 align:start position:0%
home state uh U suspending her abilities
 
04:15:15.910 --> 04:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
as well so we have a being centralized
 
04:15:18.109 --> 04:15:18.119 align:start position:0%
the way we are right now U and it's
 
04:15:20.550 --> 04:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
through standing orders um really gives
 
04:15:24.189 --> 04:15:24.199 align:start position:0%
us that that jump that Head
 
04:15:27.070 --> 04:15:27.080 align:start position:0%
Start and I want to be clear these are
 
04:15:29.790 --> 04:15:29.800 align:start position:0%
the more severe cases um I will tell you
 
04:15:31.990 --> 04:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
this is less than I think even a half a
 
04:15:35.429 --> 04:15:35.439 align:start position:0%
percent of our lenses I would say um 99%
 
04:15:37.429 --> 04:15:37.439 align:start position:0%
of our lenses are acting with within the
 
04:15:39.229 --> 04:15:39.239 align:start position:0%
professional guidelines but these are
 
04:15:40.590 --> 04:15:40.600 align:start position:0%
some of the worst of the worst that we
 
04:15:40.600 --> 04:15:41.750 align:start position:0%
some of the worst of the worst that we
do

04:15:41.750 --> 04:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:15:45.109 --> 04:15:45.119 align:start position:0%

panelist thank you very much so I'll be
 
04:19:45.269 --> 04:19:45.279 align:start position:0%
brief I know time is short today um but
 
04:19:48.070 --> 04:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
we're here to request the removal of
 
04:19:51.030 --> 04:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
part A from the bill as it pertains to
 
04:19:53.910 --> 04:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
those um skilled professional medical
 
04:19:56.790 --> 04:19:56.800 align:start position:0%
personnel and limiting those P permitted
 
04:19:59.349 --> 04:19:59.359 align:start position:0%
to render adverse clinical eligibility
 
04:20:02.510 --> 04:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
determinations to only registered nurses
 
04:20:05.550 --> 04:20:05.560 align:start position:0%
currently licensed in according with RSA
 
04:20:09.070 --> 04:20:09.080 align:start position:0%
326b so Senator John Reagan sponsored
 
04:20:12.710 --> 04:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
sb49 in 2015 to change the language
 
04:20:14.550 --> 04:20:14.560 align:start position:0%
identifying who's permitted to make
 
04:20:16.950 --> 04:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
those determinations from registered
 
04:20:19.109 --> 04:20:19.119 align:start position:0%
nurse to Skilled professional medical
 
04:20:21.189 --> 04:20:21.199 align:start position:0%
personnel this was at the Department's
 
04:20:23.830 --> 04:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
request and we testified in favor of
 
04:20:25.630 --> 04:20:25.640 align:start position:0%
this change as it would broaden the
 
04:20:28.189 --> 04:20:28.199 align:start position:0%
scope of individuals under the law
 
04:20:30.149 --> 04:20:30.159 align:start position:0%
permitted to conduct clinical
 
04:20:32.710 --> 04:20:32.720 align:start position:0%
eligibility assessments and issue
 
04:20:35.750 --> 04:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
determination so for example by allowing
 
04:20:38.790 --> 04:20:38.800 align:start position:0%
uh for API RNs to conduct assessments
 
04:20:40.389 --> 04:20:40.399 align:start position:0%
and we did this so that the department
 
04:20:43.550 --> 04:20:43.560 align:start position:0%
could fe uh fill key positions and avoid
 
04:20:45.750 --> 04:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
delays in the provision of services to
 
04:20:48.830 --> 04:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
the citizens of New Hampshire prior to
 
04:20:51.670 --> 04:20:51.680 align:start position:0%
that change the limiting language had at
 
04:20:53.990 --> 04:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
certain times placed the department in
 
04:20:56.510 --> 04:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
the position of being unable to fill the
 
04:20:58.630 --> 04:20:58.640 align:start position:0%
roles of those tasked with issuing
 
04:21:00.670 --> 04:21:00.680 align:start position:0%
determinations uh which in turn led to
 
04:21:03.189 --> 04:21:03.199 align:start position:0%
delays in issuing decisions which again
 
04:21:07.429 --> 04:21:07.439 align:start position:0%
in turn LED in to delays in services and
 
04:21:09.870 --> 04:21:09.880 align:start position:0%
that's something uh we're trying to
 
04:21:12.229 --> 04:21:12.239 align:start position:0%
avoid so the second thing I'd like to
 
04:21:14.630 --> 04:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
address quickly with you is that the
 
04:21:17.870 --> 04:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
language of proposed paragraph 3A would
 
04:21:19.790 --> 04:21:19.800 align:start position:0%
require skilled professional medical
 
04:21:23.070 --> 04:21:23.080 align:start position:0%
personnel to oversee service service
 
04:21:25.910 --> 04:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
coverage prior authorizations for
 
04:21:29.269 --> 04:21:29.279 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Home and Community Care waiver
 
04:21:31.910 --> 04:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
Services that's the CFI program here in
 
04:21:34.269 --> 04:21:34.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire choices for
 
04:21:36.590 --> 04:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
Independence um it's not necessary to
 
04:21:37.910 --> 04:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
meet the definition of skilled
 
04:21:40.149 --> 04:21:40.159 align:start position:0%
professional medical personnel in order
 
04:21:43.109 --> 04:21:43.119 align:start position:0%
to administer or supervise staff of a
 
04:21:45.389 --> 04:21:45.399 align:start position:0%
program in which staff render
 
04:21:47.910 --> 04:21:47.920 align:start position:0%
determinations this language as proposed
 
04:21:49.309 --> 04:21:49.319 align:start position:0%
singles out the department and
 
04:21:51.309 --> 04:21:51.319 align:start position:0%
Department staff who administer these
 
04:21:51.319 --> 04:21:54.030 align:start position:0%
Department staff who administer these
programs

04:21:54.030 --> 04:21:54.040 align:start position:0%
programs
 
04:21:58.349 --> 04:21:58.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:00.990 --> 04:22:01.000 align:start position:0%
me sorry about that and places
 
04:22:03.070 --> 04:22:03.080 align:start position:0%
restrictions on uh program
 
04:22:05.070 --> 04:22:05.080 align:start position:0%
administrators and supervised Beyond
 
04:22:08.269 --> 04:22:08.279 align:start position:0%
those required for similarly situated
 
04:22:10.790 --> 04:22:10.800 align:start position:0%
entities so just to give you an example
 
04:22:12.670 --> 04:22:12.680 align:start position:0%
there's no requirement that an
 
04:22:15.349 --> 04:22:15.359 align:start position:0%
administrator or supervisor of a nursing
 
04:22:18.349 --> 04:22:18.359 align:start position:0%
facility meet that definition so I had a
 
04:22:21.269 --> 04:22:21.279 align:start position:0%
conversation with uh oplc and they
 
04:22:24.349 --> 04:22:24.359 align:start position:0%
confirmed that non-clinical Personnel
 
04:22:27.349 --> 04:22:27.359 align:start position:0%
May supervise clinical Personnel uh it's
 
04:22:29.670 --> 04:22:29.680 align:start position:0%
the L who's responsible for their
 
04:22:31.790 --> 04:22:31.800 align:start position:0%
clinical decisions uh additionally
 
04:22:34.790 --> 04:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
there's no specialized training included
 
04:22:36.389 --> 04:22:36.399 align:start position:0%
in skilled Professional Medical
 
04:22:38.630 --> 04:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
Personnel training uh for example that
 
04:22:40.630 --> 04:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
of a registered nurse that would provide
 
04:22:42.590 --> 04:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
the trainee with administrative or
 
04:22:45.550 --> 04:22:45.560 align:start position:0%
supervisor capabilities Beyond those of
 
04:22:47.710 --> 04:22:47.720 align:start position:0%
Administrators or supervisors who
 
04:22:50.469 --> 04:22:50.479 align:start position:0%
haven't undergone similar training
 
04:22:52.590 --> 04:22:52.600 align:start position:0%
Additionally the language in threea
 
04:22:55.269 --> 04:22:55.279 align:start position:0%
would limit those permitted to render
 
04:22:57.349 --> 04:22:57.359 align:start position:0%
adverse service coverage determinations
 
04:23:00.950 --> 04:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
to only registered nurses and that would
 
04:23:02.590 --> 04:23:02.600 align:start position:0%
require the department to devote
 
04:23:04.910 --> 04:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
medically trained staff to render
 
04:23:06.990 --> 04:23:07.000 align:start position:0%
adverse determinations
 
04:23:08.750 --> 04:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
for requests that might be denied for
 
04:23:11.590 --> 04:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
non-clinical reasons so for example an
 
04:23:14.309 --> 04:23:14.319 align:start position:0%
incomplete application or a failure to
 
04:23:17.630 --> 04:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
exhaust third party liability denials
 
04:23:19.510 --> 04:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
like these they're they do not need the
 
04:23:21.590 --> 04:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
specific skill set of a registered nurse
 
04:23:24.349 --> 04:23:24.359 align:start position:0%
they're programmatic or administrative
 
04:23:26.630 --> 04:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
in nature and the third point I want to
 
04:23:29.389 --> 04:23:29.399 align:start position:0%
address today is that the language of
 
04:23:32.790 --> 04:23:32.800 align:start position:0%
proposed parag five defines skilled
 
04:23:34.950 --> 04:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
professional medical personnel as having
 
04:24:00.070 --> 04:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:03.710 --> 04:24:03.720 align:start position:0%
432.32 to the requirement that only
 
04:24:06.189 --> 04:24:06.199 align:start position:0%
registered nurses May render adverse
 
04:24:08.550 --> 04:24:08.560 align:start position:0%
clinical eligibility or service coverage
 
04:24:10.750 --> 04:24:10.760 align:start position:0%
determination creates additional
 
04:24:15.070 --> 04:24:15.080 align:start position:0%
exceptions to the definition um which by
 
04:24:16.990 --> 04:24:17.000 align:start position:0%
the way includes Physicians dentists
 
04:24:19.510 --> 04:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
nurses other specialized personnel with
 
04:24:21.630 --> 04:24:21.640 align:start position:0%
professional Education and Training and
 
04:24:23.990 --> 04:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
so this additional exception results in
 
04:24:26.870 --> 04:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
the definition of skilled Prof excuse me
 
04:24:28.870 --> 04:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
skilled professional medical personnel
 
04:24:31.950 --> 04:24:31.960 align:start position:0%
being more restrictive than the federal
 
04:24:34.109 --> 04:24:34.119 align:start position:0%
definition and places additional
 
04:24:37.030 --> 04:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
restrictions on who may render adverse
 
04:24:39.109 --> 04:24:39.119 align:start position:0%
determinations uh so for example under
 
04:24:41.229 --> 04:24:41.239 align:start position:0%
the current more encompassing definition
 
04:24:45.229 --> 04:24:45.239 align:start position:0%
an APRN uh would be able to render an
 
04:24:47.229 --> 04:24:47.239 align:start position:0%
adverse determination under the proposed
 
04:24:49.550 --> 04:24:49.560 align:start position:0%
definition in conjunction with some
 
04:24:51.590 --> 04:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
other language in the bill um they would
 
04:24:54.269 --> 04:24:54.279 align:start position:0%
be prohibited from doing so uh
 
04:24:56.469 --> 04:24:56.479 align:start position:0%
additionally and this is my final point
 
04:24:59.750 --> 04:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
when s sp49 was introduced in 2015 a
 
04:25:02.109 --> 04:25:02.119 align:start position:0%
subcomittee of the house Health Human
 
04:25:05.030 --> 04:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
Services and elderly Affairs committee
 
04:25:08.710 --> 04:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
worked to to hone in on that definition
 
04:25:10.269 --> 04:25:10.279 align:start position:0%
of skilled professional medical
 
04:25:13.269 --> 04:25:13.279 align:start position:0%
personnel and made that decision to
 
04:25:21.910 --> 04:25:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:27.710 --> 04:25:27.720 align:start position:0%
432.32 50 D12 little I um would be very
 
04:25:30.550 --> 04:25:30.560 align:start position:0%
confusing um and they chose that
 
04:25:33.469 --> 04:25:33.479 align:start position:0%
definition for its Reliance on the use
 
04:25:35.710 --> 04:25:35.720 align:start position:0%
of the term professional education
 
04:25:38.189 --> 04:25:38.199 align:start position:0%
andain training so again we are asking
 
04:25:40.750 --> 04:25:40.760 align:start position:0%
for removal of part nine I am available
 
04:25:40.760 --> 04:25:41.630 align:start position:0%
for removal of part nine I am available
for

04:25:41.630 --> 04:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:25:44.590 --> 04:25:44.600 align:start position:0%
questions uh both today and any and any
 
04:25:47.269 --> 04:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
subcommittees you may need me in I hope
 
04:25:49.269 --> 04:25:49.279 align:start position:0%
you're you're talking about section
 
04:25:51.630 --> 04:25:51.640 align:start position:0%
eight because that's what it is now that
 
04:25:52.990 --> 04:25:53.000 align:start position:0%
what was I
 
04:25:56.349 --> 04:25:56.359 align:start position:0%
saying okay are there questions
 
04:25:56.359 --> 04:25:59.109 align:start position:0%
saying okay are there questions
representative

04:25:59.109 --> 04:25:59.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:01.349 --> 04:26:01.359 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you madam chair Madam chair
 
04:26:02.710 --> 04:26:02.720 align:start position:0%
this is more of a question to you will
 
04:26:04.469 --> 04:26:04.479 align:start position:0%
we get some input from Health and Human
 
04:26:07.269 --> 04:26:07.279 align:start position:0%
Services committee on this I think this
 
04:26:08.670 --> 04:26:08.680 align:start position:0%
mostly deals with
 
04:26:12.590 --> 04:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
their uh topic subject topic than ours
 
04:26:16.550 --> 04:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
yes it good point I will send a note to
 
04:26:20.030 --> 04:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
the chair and ask them to comment on it
 
04:26:21.429 --> 04:26:21.439 align:start position:0%
or support the
 
04:26:27.349 --> 04:26:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:32.309 --> 04:26:32.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:36.590 --> 04:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you madam chair um so I I
 
04:26:40.189 --> 04:26:40.199 align:start position:0%
have uh some questions because as much
 
04:26:43.309 --> 04:26:43.319 align:start position:0%
as Mr osterhout is a very expert in the
 
04:26:46.510 --> 04:26:46.520 align:start position:0%
subject uh for those of us who are not
 
04:26:49.510 --> 04:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
and I include myself in that category uh
 
04:26:52.750 --> 04:26:52.760 align:start position:0%
some of it is a little bit uh a forest
 
04:26:56.590 --> 04:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
of uh uh technical terms which are not
 
04:26:59.990 --> 04:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily Illuminating uh for the uh
 
04:27:03.349 --> 04:27:03.359 align:start position:0%
unskilled practitioner again including
 
04:27:07.550 --> 04:27:07.560 align:start position:0%
myself um so uh you're talking about
 
04:27:11.590 --> 04:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
determinations adverse determinations so
 
04:27:13.550 --> 04:27:13.560 align:start position:0%
this this means you're turning people
 
04:27:17.109 --> 04:27:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:19.750 --> 04:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
treatment so the thank you for your
 
04:27:22.229 --> 04:27:22.239 align:start position:0%
question representative the CFI choices
 
04:27:24.710 --> 04:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
for Independence program which this bill
 
04:27:28.149 --> 04:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
covers that's the uh what is the I want
 
04:27:29.550 --> 04:27:29.560 align:start position:0%
to make sure I get the home and
 
04:27:32.269 --> 04:27:32.279 align:start position:0%
communitybased Care waiver services so
 
04:27:34.790 --> 04:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
essentially Medicaid would require an
 
04:27:37.269 --> 04:27:37.279 align:start position:0%
individual to be in a nursing home CFI
 
04:27:39.510 --> 04:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
program is a program that allows
 
04:27:42.710 --> 04:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
individuals to stay in their home and
 
04:27:44.870 --> 04:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
receive services so yes when I'm talking
 
04:27:48.269 --> 04:27:48.279 align:start position:0%
about eligibility it would be a denial
 
04:27:52.910 --> 04:27:52.920 align:start position:0%
of those Services Under that
 
04:27:54.950 --> 04:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
application okay
 
04:27:59.269 --> 04:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
followup uh yes before you ask your next
 
04:28:02.269 --> 04:28:02.279 align:start position:0%
question I would would these
 
04:28:05.149 --> 04:28:05.159 align:start position:0%
adverse determinations also affect
 
04:28:08.830 --> 04:28:08.840 align:start position:0%
eligibility to receive Medicaid care in
 
04:28:13.229 --> 04:28:13.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:15.750 --> 04:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
home uh thank you for your question no I
 
04:28:17.109 --> 04:28:17.119 align:start position:0%
don't believe so I believe these are
 
04:28:21.830 --> 04:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
limited to the um 1915c choices for
 
04:28:26.510 --> 04:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
Independence waiver program uh just to
 
04:28:28.630 --> 04:28:28.640 align:start position:0%
clarify so so everyone's on the same
 
04:28:32.389 --> 04:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
page the CFI program does use the same
 
04:28:35.429 --> 04:28:35.439 align:start position:0%
eligibility criteria as Nursing Facility
 
04:28:39.269 --> 04:28:39.279 align:start position:0%
elig ability that's 151
 
04:28:41.510 --> 04:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
E3 thank you representative Schmid
 
04:28:44.710 --> 04:28:44.720 align:start position:0%
please ask question well okay so uh the
 
04:28:46.389 --> 04:28:46.399 align:start position:0%
question of the chair is this going to
 
04:28:49.149 --> 04:28:49.159 align:start position:0%
The subcommittee Madam chair why yes
 
04:28:50.710 --> 04:28:50.720 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt every part of
 
04:28:53.670 --> 04:28:53.680 align:start position:0%
this bill is going to sub okay excellent
 
04:28:55.269 --> 04:28:55.279 align:start position:0%
because some of this I think should be
 
04:28:56.710 --> 04:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
explored in the subcommittee more than
 
04:29:00.030 --> 04:29:00.040 align:start position:0%
we can under these circumstances but uh
 
04:29:03.149 --> 04:29:03.159 align:start position:0%
so M Mr Oster how my next question is
 
04:29:07.469 --> 04:29:07.479 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about treat for people
 
04:29:11.189 --> 04:29:11.199 align:start position:0%
being uh rendered by people who are not
 
04:29:14.550 --> 04:29:14.560 align:start position:0%
uh at least nursing uh trained
 
04:29:16.389 --> 04:29:16.399 align:start position:0%
individuals we're not talking about
 
04:29:18.269 --> 04:29:18.279 align:start position:0%
treatment we're talking
 
04:29:21.189 --> 04:29:21.199 align:start position:0%
about the eligibility for treatment
 
04:29:23.510 --> 04:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
that's being decided on is that correct
 
04:29:25.269 --> 04:29:25.279 align:start position:0%
correct representative so the way it
 
04:29:26.910 --> 04:29:26.920 align:start position:0%
currently works is the department
 
04:29:28.590 --> 04:29:28.600 align:start position:0%
subcontracts with a company called
 
04:29:31.469 --> 04:29:31.479 align:start position:0%
keypro um keypro sends a registered
 
04:29:33.710 --> 04:29:33.720 align:start position:0%
nurse and uses a medical Eligibility
 
04:29:35.750 --> 04:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
Assessment tool as required by staff
 
04:29:38.910 --> 04:29:38.920 align:start position:0%
statue and does a face the face
 
04:29:41.429 --> 04:29:41.439 align:start position:0%
interview with the individual um and
 
04:29:43.750 --> 04:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
then if person is found open for
 
04:29:47.149 --> 04:29:47.159 align:start position:0%
services then they are open if not that
 
04:29:49.750 --> 04:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
means enrolled in the program sorry um
 
04:29:51.229 --> 04:29:51.239 align:start position:0%
and if not then it's sent to the
 
04:29:53.510 --> 04:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
department and we do a deeper Dive by
 
04:29:56.950 --> 04:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
taking a look at the individual's
 
04:29:59.830 --> 04:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
medical records and uh it's a rigorous
 
04:30:01.990 --> 04:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
process you have to go through at least
 
04:30:04.550 --> 04:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
three reviews by skilled professional
 
04:30:07.590 --> 04:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
medic Medical Personnel one being KEPR
 
04:30:09.510 --> 04:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
two in the department we have three
 
04:30:13.229 --> 04:30:13.239 align:start position:0%
individuals who do that um currently all
 
04:30:16.670 --> 04:30:16.680 align:start position:0%
three are RNs and you have to have all
 
04:30:18.750 --> 04:30:18.760 align:start position:0%
three of those individuals both the Keo
 
04:30:21.990 --> 04:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
and nursing staff here say no before
 
04:30:24.510 --> 04:30:24.520 align:start position:0%
you're denied from the program but it is
 
04:30:26.149 --> 04:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
to your question strictly for
 
04:30:29.070 --> 04:30:29.080 align:start position:0%
eligibility purposes and not the people
 
04:30:31.550 --> 04:30:31.560 align:start position:0%
providing the Hands-On
 
04:30:33.990 --> 04:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
service okay so if I understand
 
04:30:39.429 --> 04:30:39.439 align:start position:0%
correctly the um followup uh so if I
 
04:30:41.309 --> 04:30:41.319 align:start position:0%
understand correctly the uh this
 
04:30:43.670 --> 04:30:43.680 align:start position:0%
procedure has been in effect since
 
04:30:47.349 --> 04:30:47.359 align:start position:0%
approx approximately 2015 is it working
 
04:30:48.830 --> 04:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
well in the opinion of the
 
04:30:51.469 --> 04:30:51.479 align:start position:0%
department yes
 
04:30:55.510 --> 04:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
sir followup followup is there anything
 
04:30:58.429 --> 04:30:58.439 align:start position:0%
unusual about this procedure in terms of
 
04:31:00.590 --> 04:31:00.600 align:start position:0%
how other states handle it if it's
 
04:31:00.600 --> 04:31:02.590 align:start position:0%
how other states handle it if it's
working

04:31:02.590 --> 04:31:02.600 align:start position:0%
working
 
04:31:06.830 --> 04:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
well that's information I do not have
 
04:31:09.189 --> 04:31:09.199 align:start position:0%
repr okay uh we'll look at it in the
 
04:31:14.269 --> 04:31:14.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:18.109 --> 04:31:18.119 align:start position:0%
sir are there any other
 
04:31:20.910 --> 04:31:20.920 align:start position:0%
questions is there is there anyone else
 
04:31:28.309 --> 04:31:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:31.429 --> 04:31:31.439 align:start position:0%
Eight see any
 
04:31:43.189 --> 04:31:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:46.910 --> 04:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
Marling is Senator Hennessy with
 
04:32:03.910 --> 04:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:06.910 --> 04:32:06.920 align:start position:0%
yes so you should be able to unmute
 
04:32:14.070 --> 04:32:14.080 align:start position:0%

04:32:28.269 --> 04:32:28.279 align:start position:0%
lure of certified licensed nursing
 
04:32:31.510 --> 04:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
assistance and what this does is um
 
04:32:33.710 --> 04:32:33.720 align:start position:0%
allow the recognition of the hard work
 
04:32:36.469 --> 04:32:36.479 align:start position:0%
of those people who completed an 8-hour
 
04:32:39.030 --> 04:32:39.040 align:start position:0%
training course and became temporary
 
04:32:41.229 --> 04:32:41.239 align:start position:0%
Health Care Health Providers Health Care
 
04:32:44.109 --> 04:32:44.119 align:start position:0%
Providers during the covid pandemic and
 
04:32:46.189 --> 04:32:46.199 align:start position:0%
these people were very critical in
 
04:32:49.750 --> 04:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
serving the needs of especially our um
 
04:32:52.750 --> 04:32:52.760 align:start position:0%
our nursing homes in in the pandemic
 
04:32:55.389 --> 04:32:55.399 align:start position:0%
time and this would allow those
 
04:32:58.309 --> 04:32:58.319 align:start position:0%
individuals who have uh done this online
 
04:33:00.950 --> 04:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
training and had no fewer than a 100
 
04:33:04.349 --> 04:33:04.359 align:start position:0%
hours of work under other licensed
 
04:33:08.070 --> 04:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
professionals um in the um healthc care
 
04:33:11.830 --> 04:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
field um to be recognized as lnas if
 
04:33:15.709 --> 04:33:15.719 align:start position:0%
they've also completed the required um
 
04:33:21.629 --> 04:33:21.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:25.230 --> 04:33:25.240 align:start position:0%
lnas so that uh if I understand
 
04:33:27.310 --> 04:33:27.320 align:start position:0%
correctly you're saying that these
 
04:33:30.189 --> 04:33:30.199 align:start position:0%
people can take an online course and
 
04:33:33.029 --> 04:33:33.039 align:start position:0%
serve for 100 hours and then be eligible
 
04:33:36.590 --> 04:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
for lure as an LNA yes that's correct
 
04:33:38.750 --> 04:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
and there are other people on the line
 
04:33:42.510 --> 04:33:42.520 align:start position:0%
that um are much more um knowledgeable
 
04:33:44.310 --> 04:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
about the the entire process and how
 
04:33:48.150 --> 04:33:48.160 align:start position:0%
many individuals um this will affect but
 
04:33:49.789 --> 04:33:49.799 align:start position:0%
there are at least
 
04:33:52.869 --> 04:33:52.879 align:start position:0%
1,000 um there's a at least a thousand
 
04:33:55.629 --> 04:33:55.639 align:start position:0%
LNA shortage of of Workforce shortage in
 
04:33:58.189 --> 04:33:58.199 align:start position:0%
the state currently and this would just
 
04:34:00.429 --> 04:34:00.439 align:start position:0%
make a a little bit of dent in that
 
04:34:02.429 --> 04:34:02.439 align:start position:0%
population that we're looking to
 
04:34:04.269 --> 04:34:04.279 align:start position:0%

the 100 hours and how you came up with
 
04:35:13.910 --> 04:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
that amount because that's not a lot I
 
04:35:16.629 --> 04:35:16.639 align:start position:0%
mean that's less than three weeks of of
 
04:35:19.109 --> 04:35:19.119 align:start position:0%
actually doing this it's kind of like
 
04:35:21.269 --> 04:35:21.279 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship three hours of
 
04:35:23.470 --> 04:35:23.480 align:start position:0%

for the law firm of Brin Shure and I am
 
04:36:24.869 --> 04:36:24.879 align:start position:0%
here representing the New Hampshire
 
04:36:26.310 --> 04:36:26.320 align:start position:0%
healthc care
 
04:36:28.709 --> 04:36:28.719 align:start position:0%
Association and let me just give you a
 
04:36:31.590 --> 04:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
little bit of history about this when Co
 
04:36:35.230 --> 04:36:35.240 align:start position:0%
started as we all remember last last uh
 
04:36:38.910 --> 04:36:38.920 align:start position:0%
um March the federal government uh
 
04:36:41.510 --> 04:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
extended a waiver for states allowing
 
04:36:43.869 --> 04:36:43.879 align:start position:0%
temperary nurses AIDS and nursing homes
 
04:36:46.789 --> 04:36:46.799 align:start position:0%
with limited training as you will
 
04:36:49.910 --> 04:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
remember um the federal government also
 
04:36:55.269 --> 04:36:55.279 align:start position:0%
put in their $600 stien for people who
 
04:36:59.390 --> 04:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
um chose for one reason or another uh
 
04:37:01.910 --> 04:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
not to go to not to work during Co
 
04:37:03.830 --> 04:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
because of child care issues Health Care
 
04:37:07.150 --> 04:37:07.160 align:start position:0%
issues ETC so once they put in that $600
 
04:37:09.789 --> 04:37:09.799 align:start position:0%
stien on top of unemployment the nursing
 
04:37:13.830 --> 04:37:13.840 align:start position:0%
homes were losing a lot of Staff um so
 
04:37:17.109 --> 04:37:17.119 align:start position:0%
this Federal waiver was really a huge
 
04:37:19.429 --> 04:37:19.439 align:start position:0%
help and what ended up happening is New
 
04:37:21.789 --> 04:37:21.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh called these people
 
04:37:24.150 --> 04:37:24.160 align:start position:0%
temporary health partners and they were
 
04:37:26.230 --> 04:37:26.240 align:start position:0%
authorized to work in the nursing homes
 
04:37:29.269 --> 04:37:29.279 align:start position:0%
under licensed staff supervision by an
 
04:37:32.230 --> 04:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
emergency order 42 that the governor put
 
04:37:34.990 --> 04:37:35.000 align:start position:0%
into effect May 11th uh these were
 
04:37:37.629 --> 04:37:37.639 align:start position:0%
workers I have to say provided
 
04:37:40.629 --> 04:37:40.639 align:start position:0%
invaluable help and assistance they were
 
04:37:44.310 --> 04:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
always supervised by lient staff but
 
04:37:46.230 --> 04:37:46.240 align:start position:0%
they really really helped therefore
 
04:37:48.709 --> 04:37:48.719 align:start position:0%
while we were having to even have people
 
04:37:52.429 --> 04:37:52.439 align:start position:0%
who were um working in Food Service come
 
04:37:54.910 --> 04:37:54.920 align:start position:0%
in and help help with residents it was
 
04:37:57.670 --> 04:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
it was it was a bit of a a bit of a mess
 
04:38:01.029 --> 04:38:01.039 align:start position:0%
um as Senator Hennessy said the New
 
04:38:02.709 --> 04:38:02.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has experienced a huge
 
04:38:05.869 --> 04:38:05.879 align:start position:0%
shortage of uh licensed nurs assistance
 
04:38:08.830 --> 04:38:08.840 align:start position:0%
we went from June of
 
04:38:14.310 --> 04:38:14.320 align:start position:0%
2018 um to June of 200 and may of 2020
 
04:38:18.869 --> 04:38:18.879 align:start position:0%
year 22 years we suffered a net loss of
 
04:38:22.230 --> 04:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
uh nearly 1300 licensed nursing
 
04:38:25.390 --> 04:38:25.400 align:start position:0%
assistance and that's a tremendous loss
 
04:38:29.150 --> 04:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
of really valuable um staff and we also
 
04:38:32.029 --> 04:38:32.039 align:start position:0%
unfortunately have a number of licensed
 
04:38:33.789 --> 04:38:33.799 align:start position:0%
nursing assistants going to
 
04:38:36.470 --> 04:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts because you can uh imagine
 
04:38:38.070 --> 04:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
there's a lot better pay in
 
04:38:39.670 --> 04:38:39.680 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts particularly with
 
04:38:43.109 --> 04:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
hospitals Etc so we've had a real
 
04:38:43.119 --> 04:38:45.150 align:start position:0%
hospitals Etc so we've had a real
shortage

04:38:45.150 --> 04:38:45.160 align:start position:0%
shortage
 
04:38:49.109 --> 04:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
um to say that this uh language that
 
04:38:52.349 --> 04:38:52.359 align:start position:0%
Senator Hennessy has has introduced it's
 
04:38:54.830 --> 04:38:54.840 align:start position:0%
going to solve the problem no but it is
 
04:38:58.949 --> 04:38:58.959 align:start position:0%
a real help at a time we still very much
 
04:39:01.830 --> 04:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
need um need workers in the in the
 
04:39:05.029 --> 04:39:05.039 align:start position:0%
nursing homes it's a it's a step forward
 
04:39:07.109 --> 04:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
um these are are men and women who've
 
04:39:10.709 --> 04:39:10.719 align:start position:0%
shown interest in health care and in in
 
04:39:13.029 --> 04:39:13.039 align:start position:0%
nursing being nursing assistants and
 
04:39:14.949 --> 04:39:14.959 align:start position:0%
they've really been an integral part of
 
04:39:18.109 --> 04:39:18.119 align:start position:0%
the system for the last Almost um uh
 
04:39:21.429 --> 04:39:21.439 align:start position:0%
year plus so we appreciate the bip part
 
04:39:23.990 --> 04:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
support we appreciate Senator Hennessy
 
04:39:26.590 --> 04:39:26.600 align:start position:0%
doing this and we just really would ask
 
04:39:28.910 --> 04:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
you uh if you could move this forward
 
04:39:31.510 --> 04:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
because we very much need need the help
 
04:39:33.150 --> 04:39:33.160 align:start position:0%

Rosenberger that we've heard about um
 
04:39:50.550 --> 04:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
people leaving the state because we
 
04:39:53.708 --> 04:39:53.718 align:start position:0%
don't have adequate pay right and
 
04:39:56.070 --> 04:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
therefore can we do something about our
 
04:39:57.948 --> 04:39:57.958 align:start position:0%
standards to so that people who don't
 
04:40:01.350 --> 04:40:01.360 align:start position:0%
meet them but are willing to take the
 
04:40:03.390 --> 04:40:03.400 align:start position:0%
pay get the
 
04:40:06.310 --> 04:40:06.320 align:start position:0%

04:40:12.590 --> 04:40:12.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:40:16.948 --> 04:40:16.958 align:start position:0%

04:40:22.430 --> 04:40:22.440 align:start position:0%
that are working at this special
 
04:40:25.190 --> 04:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
level to eventually meet the criteria
 
04:40:29.750 --> 04:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:33.470 --> 04:40:33.480 align:start position:0%
state I'm I'm not quite sure I
 
04:40:34.788 --> 04:40:34.798 align:start position:0%
understand the question but let me
 
04:40:36.830 --> 04:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
respond and then I'd love it if you'd
 
04:40:40.430 --> 04:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
ask me again um the way this has worked
 
04:40:43.470 --> 04:40:43.480 align:start position:0%
and we did work with the the um Nurses
 
04:40:45.550 --> 04:40:45.560 align:start position:0%
Association with it when this started I
 
04:40:48.510 --> 04:40:48.520 align:start position:0%
will say representative gry back in last
 
04:40:52.150 --> 04:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
March lots of conversation and and
 
04:40:54.470 --> 04:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
collaboration with the nursing
 
04:40:54.480 --> 04:40:56.470 align:start position:0%
collaboration with the nursing
association

04:40:56.470 --> 04:40:56.480 align:start position:0%
association
 
04:41:00.430 --> 04:41:00.440 align:start position:0%
oplc um the the organizations that train
 
04:41:02.270 --> 04:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
the nurses and the licensed nursing
 
04:41:05.310 --> 04:41:05.320 align:start position:0%
assistants and so the program we came up
 
04:41:08.350 --> 04:41:08.360 align:start position:0%
with for the temporary uh the temporary
 
04:41:11.110 --> 04:41:11.120 align:start position:0%
um nursing license nursing assistance
 
04:41:13.628 --> 04:41:13.638 align:start position:0%
was really worked in collaboration with
 
04:41:17.510 --> 04:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
with all of them um if you see in the
 
04:41:21.110 --> 04:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
bill there's criteria in there that you
 
04:41:23.868 --> 04:41:23.878 align:start position:0%
have to have so many hours of training
 
04:41:26.628 --> 04:41:26.638 align:start position:0%
that you have to work so many hours as a
 
04:41:31.230 --> 04:41:31.240 align:start position:0%
temporary uh uh Health partner that you
 
04:41:34.110 --> 04:41:34.120 align:start position:0%
had to be doing this by a certain date
 
04:41:37.628 --> 04:41:37.638 align:start position:0%
and that also uh the important part of
 
04:41:39.708 --> 04:41:39.718 align:start position:0%
it is one of the things the Nurses
 
04:41:41.948 --> 04:41:41.958 align:start position:0%
Association wanted is that you you're
 
04:41:45.708 --> 04:41:45.718 align:start position:0%
required to do continuing education so
 
04:41:50.310 --> 04:41:50.320 align:start position:0%
we've tried to make this as um I guess I
 
04:41:53.788 --> 04:41:53.798 align:start position:0%
would say as finite as possible and make
 
04:41:56.230 --> 04:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
sure that these men and women are
 
04:41:58.948 --> 04:41:58.958 align:start position:0%
supervised by licensed nurses but we are
 
04:42:02.708 --> 04:42:02.718 align:start position:0%
giving them credit frankly for the work
 
04:42:04.750 --> 04:42:04.760 align:start position:0%
they are doing while they have been in
 
04:42:08.390 --> 04:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
this temporary position uh during Co so
 
04:42:10.590 --> 04:42:10.600 align:start position:0%
they've gotten some valuable experience
 
04:42:12.590 --> 04:42:12.600 align:start position:0%
I will say probably more so than they
 
04:42:14.190 --> 04:42:14.200 align:start position:0%
would have without Co because the
 
04:42:16.430 --> 04:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
staffing has been such and they've
 
04:42:19.070 --> 04:42:19.080 align:start position:0%
they've really it's been a all hands on
 
04:42:22.390 --> 04:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
deck uh situation so I don't know if
 
04:42:24.708 --> 04:42:24.718 align:start position:0%
that answered your question it was an
 
04:42:28.910 --> 04:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
attempt it was a very good attempt um
 
04:42:30.948 --> 04:42:30.958 align:start position:0%
thank you I I do have a follow-up
 
04:42:33.670 --> 04:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
question though I'm followup thank you
 
04:42:35.070 --> 04:42:35.080 align:start position:0%
I'm commenting
 
04:42:38.390 --> 04:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm responding to the comment
 
04:42:41.628 --> 04:42:41.638 align:start position:0%
that was made um the question there this
 
04:42:45.110 --> 04:42:45.120 align:start position:0%
previously should we make this a
 
04:42:47.390 --> 04:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
standard operating
 
04:42:51.470 --> 04:42:51.480 align:start position:0%
procedure well I I will speak I will ask
 
04:42:53.788 --> 04:42:53.798 align:start position:0%
my client but I will speak with great
 
04:42:57.868 --> 04:42:57.878 align:start position:0%
knowledge of uh my client and their
 
04:43:00.230 --> 04:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
constituents meaning the nursing homes
 
04:43:04.510 --> 04:43:04.520 align:start position:0%
um I would say yes the the the short
 
04:43:07.270 --> 04:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
shortage of Staff has just been
 
04:43:09.708 --> 04:43:09.718 align:start position:0%
unbelievable we have administrators I
 
04:43:13.150 --> 04:43:13.160 align:start position:0%
was on the phone this morning um with
 
04:43:15.948 --> 04:43:15.958 align:start position:0%
with an administrator who said you know
 
04:43:18.150 --> 04:43:18.160 align:start position:0%
she's now having to roll up her sleeves
 
04:43:21.390 --> 04:43:21.400 align:start position:0%
and go in to give care she stayed in
 
04:43:22.910 --> 04:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
this administrator is in the North
 
04:43:25.430 --> 04:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
Country this nursing home administ and
 
04:43:28.510 --> 04:43:28.520 align:start position:0%
she said they have contracts with 10
 
04:43:32.070 --> 04:43:32.080 align:start position:0%
staffing agencies looking for staff to
 
04:43:34.030 --> 04:43:34.040 align:start position:0%
help and as you can well imagine if
 
04:43:35.628 --> 04:43:35.638 align:start position:0%
you're having go through a staffing
 
04:43:38.788 --> 04:43:38.798 align:start position:0%
agency to get help you're paying top
 
04:43:41.390 --> 04:43:41.400 align:start position:0%
dollar because you've got people coming
 
04:43:43.830 --> 04:43:43.840 align:start position:0%
in from out of state helping and the and
 
04:43:48.628 --> 04:43:48.638 align:start position:0%
the costs are quite they're high but she
 
04:43:50.948 --> 04:43:50.958 align:start position:0%
said we not even being able to get
 
04:43:52.830 --> 04:43:52.840 align:start position:0%
people from the staffing agencies to
 
04:43:55.030 --> 04:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
come in in the North country and here
 
04:43:56.550 --> 04:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
she is the administrator is going to
 
04:44:00.190 --> 04:44:00.200 align:start position:0%
start giving Direct Care um so I think
 
04:44:03.390 --> 04:44:03.400 align:start position:0%
anything the state can do to help this
 
04:44:05.670 --> 04:44:05.680 align:start position:0%
situation would be terrific this is a
 
04:44:08.350 --> 04:44:08.360 align:start position:0%
small step there are other things
 
04:44:11.868 --> 04:44:11.878 align:start position:0%
obviously we would um love to Advocate
 
04:44:14.030 --> 04:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
not so much so in this bill but but it
 
04:44:16.750 --> 04:44:16.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's a help I was on the call every
 
04:44:19.190 --> 04:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
Friday during the pandemic and now it's
 
04:44:21.590 --> 04:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
every other week with these folks who
 
04:44:24.708 --> 04:44:24.718 align:start position:0%
running the nursing homes and it was
 
04:44:26.990 --> 04:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
they are doing God's work it was amazing
 
04:44:28.948 --> 04:44:28.958 align:start position:0%
what they were doing what they were what
 
04:44:32.990 --> 04:44:33.000 align:start position:0%
was going on and what the lack of staff
 
04:44:35.510 --> 04:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
was really the problem it was creating
 
04:44:37.110 --> 04:44:37.120 align:start position:0%
the temporary licensed nursing
 
04:44:39.270 --> 04:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
assistance was a huge help at a really
 
04:44:41.550 --> 04:44:41.560 align:start position:0%
crisis time so I longwind way of saying
 
04:44:43.550 --> 04:44:43.560 align:start position:0%
yes I think if you would like to do it
 
04:44:46.150 --> 04:44:46.160 align:start position:0%
for the long term that would be great
 
04:44:49.550 --> 04:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
we'll take any help we can get so I have
 
04:44:52.550 --> 04:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
a I have a last question Madam chair yes
 
04:44:54.830 --> 04:44:54.840 align:start position:0%
representative thank you if we were to
 
04:44:57.510 --> 04:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
do this then would
 
04:45:01.868 --> 04:45:01.878 align:start position:0%
the how would this um work without
 
04:45:08.510 --> 04:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:11.230 --> 04:45:11.240 align:start position:0%
care may I ask what you mean by quality
 
04:45:13.310 --> 04:45:13.320 align:start position:0%
Care well let's just say that we have
 
04:45:15.350 --> 04:45:15.360 align:start position:0%
standards now that are met based on what
 
04:45:18.628 --> 04:45:18.638 align:start position:0%
we think provides quality care to the V
 
04:45:21.190 --> 04:45:21.200 align:start position:0%
right right so if we were to I'm going
 
04:45:23.868 --> 04:45:23.878 align:start position:0%
just use the Expression lower the bar
 
04:45:26.628 --> 04:45:26.638 align:start position:0%
yes okay and then how do we make know
 
04:45:28.430 --> 04:45:28.440 align:start position:0%
that when we lower the bar the bar
 
04:45:29.910 --> 04:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't stay
 
04:45:32.990 --> 04:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
low right and so what would be the
 
04:45:35.550 --> 04:45:35.560 align:start position:0%
gradual What would could could there be
 
04:45:38.590 --> 04:45:38.600 align:start position:0%
a program in implemented so that okay
 
04:45:41.670 --> 04:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
the bar starts low but then there is a
 
04:45:44.110 --> 04:45:44.120 align:start position:0%
stepup curve to meet the current
 
04:45:46.550 --> 04:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
standard let me get back to you on that
 
04:45:49.788 --> 04:45:49.798 align:start position:0%
but I will say that I think in all the
 
04:45:52.310 --> 04:45:52.320 align:start position:0%
conversations from when this first
 
04:45:55.070 --> 04:45:55.080 align:start position:0%
started the thought was you had people
 
04:45:57.750 --> 04:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
who were out of work who might uh and
 
04:45:59.190 --> 04:45:59.200 align:start position:0%
particularly in the food service
 
04:46:01.788 --> 04:46:01.798 align:start position:0%
industry Etc who might be looking for
 
04:46:04.550 --> 04:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
change in professions so if we could get
 
04:46:07.390 --> 04:46:07.400 align:start position:0%
them in give them a try see if they
 
04:46:09.510 --> 04:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
liked it and then they could go through
 
04:46:13.670 --> 04:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
the process of actually becoming um
 
04:46:18.910 --> 04:46:18.920 align:start position:0%
lnas and so I think everybody's thought
 
04:46:21.190 --> 04:46:21.200 align:start position:0%
initially was one this was helped but
 
04:46:23.230 --> 04:46:23.240 align:start position:0%
was also getting people into the system
 
04:46:25.230 --> 04:46:25.240 align:start position:0%
to see if they
 
04:46:29.350 --> 04:46:29.360 align:start position:0%
they were cut out for the work and then
 
04:46:31.868 --> 04:46:31.878 align:start position:0%
through that let them get hands-on
 
04:46:34.230 --> 04:46:34.240 align:start position:0%
experience as well as go through some
 
04:46:37.548 --> 04:46:37.558 align:start position:0%
some education and eventually become a
 
04:46:40.470 --> 04:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
licensed nursing assistant thank you so
 
04:46:42.230 --> 04:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
much and thank you m welcome and I will
 
04:46:43.750 --> 04:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
get back to you I'll give you I'll send
 
04:46:45.510 --> 04:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
you some written information on that as
 
04:46:47.470 --> 04:46:47.480 align:start position:0%
well all right thank you the idea is
 
04:46:49.628 --> 04:46:49.638 align:start position:0%
this is this is a gateway frankly to
 
04:46:52.310 --> 04:46:52.320 align:start position:0%
getting people into the system that are
 
04:46:52.320 --> 04:46:53.670 align:start position:0%
getting people into the system that are
licensed

04:46:53.670 --> 04:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
licensed
 
04:46:58.628 --> 04:46:58.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:01.430 --> 04:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
you thank you madam chair and thank you
 
04:47:02.948 --> 04:47:02.958 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
04:47:04.750 --> 04:47:04.760 align:start position:0%
question uh
 
04:47:05.990 --> 04:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you have the answer
 
04:47:08.230 --> 04:47:08.240 align:start position:0%
right now or if you could get it for us
 
04:47:10.990 --> 04:47:11.000 align:start position:0%
do you know what the average entry wage
 
04:47:14.030 --> 04:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
is of an LNA that nursing homes have
 
04:47:18.628 --> 04:47:18.638 align:start position:0%
pay I don't but uh I can give you a good
 
04:47:22.030 --> 04:47:22.040 align:start position:0%
guess but I don't but I do know that one
 
04:47:23.868 --> 04:47:23.878 align:start position:0%
of the issues frankly has been
 
04:47:26.628 --> 04:47:26.638 align:start position:0%
representing goalie that we' and it's
 
04:47:28.868 --> 04:47:28.878 align:start position:0%
not just nursing homes who have limited
 
04:47:31.590 --> 04:47:31.600 align:start position:0%
staff it's hospitals as well and
 
04:47:33.788 --> 04:47:33.798 align:start position:0%
hospitals are much more well capitalized
 
04:47:37.270 --> 04:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
than nursing homes um so unfortunately
 
04:47:38.990 --> 04:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
well in fact on the call this morning
 
04:47:41.510 --> 04:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
there was a woman who said they had
 
04:47:44.590 --> 04:47:44.600 align:start position:0%
three people who came in and they were
 
04:47:47.190 --> 04:47:47.200 align:start position:0%
trained in an LNA program in their
 
04:47:50.868 --> 04:47:50.878 align:start position:0%
facility they worked and the Hope was
 
04:47:53.270 --> 04:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
again this was an entry level into these
 
04:47:56.070 --> 04:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
people being there uh one of them left
 
04:47:58.708 --> 04:47:58.718 align:start position:0%
and went to Massachusetts and and the
 
04:48:00.270 --> 04:48:00.280 align:start position:0%
other one went right down the street to
 
04:48:02.110 --> 04:48:02.120 align:start position:0%
the local hospital because they can pay
 
04:48:05.230 --> 04:48:05.240 align:start position:0%
more and I think the hospitals maybe are
 
04:48:08.350 --> 04:48:08.360 align:start position:0%
paying ,750 or so an hour and probably
 
04:48:11.590 --> 04:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
the nursing homes starting are around 12
 
04:48:13.708 --> 04:48:13.718 align:start position:0%
um as you know I could get really
 
04:48:15.548 --> 04:48:15.558 align:start position:0%
complicated into this but this not the
 
04:48:17.670 --> 04:48:17.680 align:start position:0%
Edna committee part of the real issue
 
04:48:20.150 --> 04:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
here represent goalie is the Medicaid
 
04:48:23.030 --> 04:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates and with Medicaid
 
04:48:26.628 --> 04:48:26.638 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates not what they should
 
04:48:29.868 --> 04:48:29.878 align:start position:0%
be the the nursing homes have no they
 
04:48:32.990 --> 04:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
they can't pay what a hospital can
 
04:48:35.708 --> 04:48:35.718 align:start position:0%
pay because the rates the rates are way
 
04:48:39.430 --> 04:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
too low and frankly it would be great if
 
04:48:42.230 --> 04:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
the the the finance committee would
 
04:48:44.390 --> 04:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
somehow or another raise those Medicaid
 
04:48:45.990 --> 04:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates we could certainly
 
04:48:50.230 --> 04:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
pay more so follow up follow
 
04:48:50.240 --> 04:48:51.948 align:start position:0%
pay more so follow up follow
yes

04:48:51.948 --> 04:48:51.958 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:48:54.628 --> 04:48:54.638 align:start position:0%
so qualifications may not be the
 
04:48:56.990 --> 04:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
complete issue wages may be another
 
04:48:59.230 --> 04:48:59.240 align:start position:0%
factor in this correct oh wages Wages
 
04:49:00.830 --> 04:49:00.840 align:start position:0%
that's absolutely not a question wages
 
04:49:02.430 --> 04:49:02.440 align:start position:0%
are a big issue and what you've got
 
04:49:04.628 --> 04:49:04.638 align:start position:0%
right now in the nursing homes is
 
04:49:08.390 --> 04:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
because when covid hit you couldn't take
 
04:49:10.430 --> 04:49:10.440 align:start position:0%
patients who were tested positive for
 
04:49:13.150 --> 04:49:13.160 align:start position:0%
covid and so all of a sudden the census
 
04:49:15.350 --> 04:49:15.360 align:start position:0%
coming from the hospitals was less
 
04:49:16.628 --> 04:49:16.638 align:start position:0%
because you get a number of people
 
04:49:18.310 --> 04:49:18.320 align:start position:0%
referred to nursing homes that are
 
04:49:21.750 --> 04:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
coming from hospitals that need rehab um
 
04:49:24.910 --> 04:49:24.920 align:start position:0%
so your census was last people weren't
 
04:49:26.788 --> 04:49:26.798 align:start position:0%
coming in for one reason or another so
 
04:49:29.350 --> 04:49:29.360 align:start position:0%
right now you've got decreased number of
 
04:49:31.708 --> 04:49:31.718 align:start position:0%
people in the home
 
04:49:34.430 --> 04:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
the if I could find my notes from this
 
04:49:36.990 --> 04:49:37.000 align:start position:0%
morning I'll tell you this is just what
 
04:49:39.070 --> 04:49:39.080 align:start position:0%
that we were told by this Nursing Home
 
04:49:41.270 --> 04:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
in the North Country this morning cost
 
04:49:42.590 --> 04:49:42.600 align:start position:0%
are up
 
04:49:46.788 --> 04:49:46.798 align:start position:0%
58% wages are up 34% and that's because
 
04:49:48.830 --> 04:49:48.840 align:start position:0%
they're having to get staff from
 
04:49:52.628 --> 04:49:52.638 align:start position:0%
staffing agencies at of State um the
 
04:49:55.548 --> 04:49:55.558 align:start position:0%
occupancy rate is is down and the
 
04:49:57.150 --> 04:49:57.160 align:start position:0%
revenue is down
 
04:50:01.030 --> 04:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
27% and that's you know that's you got
 
04:50:05.230 --> 04:50:05.240 align:start position:0%
you wages is absolutely a problem but
 
04:50:07.270 --> 04:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
this bill is not solving that problem
 
04:50:09.390 --> 04:50:09.400 align:start position:0%
we're hoping other committees and the
 
04:50:11.390 --> 04:50:11.400 align:start position:0%
Senate and the house will will help with
 
04:50:14.110 --> 04:50:14.120 align:start position:0%
that but this would just really help um
 
04:50:16.670 --> 04:50:16.680 align:start position:0%
get some bodies in those spaces
 
04:50:18.150 --> 04:50:18.160 align:start position:0%
particularly of people who want to
 
04:50:21.230 --> 04:50:21.240 align:start position:0%
consider a career and be trained and
 
04:50:23.470 --> 04:50:23.480 align:start position:0%
paid while they're being
 
04:50:26.548 --> 04:50:26.558 align:start position:0%
trained thank you're welcome
 
04:50:26.558 --> 04:50:28.110 align:start position:0%
trained thank you're welcome
representative

04:50:28.110 --> 04:50:28.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:50:31.270 --> 04:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
fellows thank you madam chair um I'm
 
04:50:33.670 --> 04:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
wondering if you can help me with this
 
04:50:37.190 --> 04:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
um I'm concerned that if the requirement
 
04:50:41.548 --> 04:50:41.558 align:start position:0%
is only a 100 hours on the job that some
 
04:50:45.270 --> 04:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
of these temporary lnas were worked in
 
04:50:48.708 --> 04:50:48.718 align:start position:0%
one facility doing one task and that
 
04:50:52.990 --> 04:50:53.000 align:start position:0%
they're not qualified for all the tasks
 
04:50:56.510 --> 04:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
that um one would expect of an an LNA
 
04:50:58.390 --> 04:50:58.400 align:start position:0%
that went through the regular program
 
04:51:01.868 --> 04:51:01.878 align:start position:0%
can you address that well I think that's
 
04:51:04.310 --> 04:51:04.320 align:start position:0%
these are temporary they're temporary
 
04:51:06.670 --> 04:51:06.680 align:start position:0%
licensed nursing assistants they're not
 
04:51:09.390 --> 04:51:09.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:12.350 --> 04:51:12.360 align:start position:0%
permanent so they they are coming in on
 
04:51:14.470 --> 04:51:14.480 align:start position:0%
a temporary basis if they want to be an
 
04:51:18.110 --> 04:51:18.120 align:start position:0%
LNA they need to go through a re a
 
04:51:20.430 --> 04:51:20.440 align:start position:0%
regular LNA they need to go through an
 
04:51:20.440 --> 04:51:21.590 align:start position:0%
regular LNA they need to go through an
LNA

04:51:21.590 --> 04:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
LNA
 
04:51:21.600 --> 04:51:23.230 align:start position:0%
LNA
program

04:51:23.230 --> 04:51:23.240 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:51:28.070 --> 04:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
which the way this is set up they and
 
04:51:30.708 --> 04:51:30.718 align:start position:0%
they have to have done this by April 1st
 
04:51:30.718 --> 04:51:32.750 align:start position:0%
they have to have done this by April 1st
of

04:51:32.750 --> 04:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:51:32.760 --> 04:51:34.390 align:start position:0%
of
2021

04:51:34.390 --> 04:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
2021
 
04:51:37.788 --> 04:51:37.798 align:start position:0%
so unless you have been in a nursing
 
04:51:40.350 --> 04:51:40.360 align:start position:0%
home as a temporary health partner by
 
04:51:44.350 --> 04:51:44.360 align:start position:0%
April 1st of 20121 you don't
 
04:51:47.390 --> 04:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
qualify and representative fellows you
 
04:51:50.910 --> 04:51:50.920 align:start position:0%
should be aware that the LNA is the
 
04:51:53.110 --> 04:51:53.120 align:start position:0%
lowest level of licensed health
 
04:51:56.628 --> 04:51:56.638 align:start position:0%
professionals right and the education
 
04:51:58.830 --> 04:51:58.840 align:start position:0%
requirements are not that strict for
 
04:52:01.510 --> 04:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
initial lure but the continuing
 
04:52:04.830 --> 04:52:04.840 align:start position:0%
education requirements are fairly
 
04:52:09.670 --> 04:52:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:13.390 --> 04:52:13.400 align:start position:0%
uncommon so I I still would would is
 
04:52:15.030 --> 04:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
there somebody else that's going to come
 
04:52:16.868 --> 04:52:16.878 align:start position:0%
up that can answer the questions about
 
04:52:18.590 --> 04:52:18.600 align:start position:0%
like what the skills are that they're
 
04:52:21.510 --> 04:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
expected to have the reg under the
 
04:52:24.948 --> 04:52:24.958 align:start position:0%
regular license
 
04:52:27.830 --> 04:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
method I can get that to you if you if
 
04:52:29.708 --> 04:52:29.718 align:start position:0%
you'd like you you want to know the
 
04:52:34.868 --> 04:52:34.878 align:start position:0%
skills of the license um the they the
 
04:52:38.510 --> 04:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
lnas correct
 
04:52:41.670 --> 04:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
okay and if you could get the normal
 
04:52:44.230 --> 04:52:44.240 align:start position:0%
hours of training yeah right that would
 
04:52:47.030 --> 04:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
be useful because all I remember from
 
04:52:50.990 --> 04:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
the study committee was that uh at least
 
04:52:53.270 --> 04:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
a couple of high schools in the state
 
04:52:55.350 --> 04:52:55.360 align:start position:0%
have part-time training programs that
 
04:52:59.470 --> 04:52:59.480 align:start position:0%
qualify people for an LNA license right
 
04:53:01.628 --> 04:53:01.638 align:start position:0%
essentially before they even
 
04:53:05.190 --> 04:53:05.200 align:start position:0%
graduate although you can't get it
 
04:53:07.350 --> 04:53:07.360 align:start position:0%
graduate that's
 
04:53:11.350 --> 04:53:11.360 align:start position:0%
right I will get you the um skill level
 
04:53:12.910 --> 04:53:12.920 align:start position:0%
and I'll get your comparison
 
04:53:15.270 --> 04:53:15.280 align:start position:0%
representative fellas thank you Mr
 
04:53:17.788 --> 04:53:17.798 align:start position:0%

the state of New Hampshire so it's

fitting that I would be bringing the
 
04:54:58.548 --> 04:54:58.558 align:start position:0%
section of um of Senate Bill 133 to you
 
04:55:01.270 --> 04:55:01.280 align:start position:0%
which is part 10 this is a relative I'm
 
04:55:02.750 --> 04:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
introducing the section that's relative
 
04:55:04.190 --> 04:55:04.200 align:start position:0%
to the revocation
 
04:55:06.510 --> 04:55:06.520 align:start position:0%
of lure for licensed Emergency Medical
 
04:55:09.590 --> 04:55:09.600 align:start position:0%

Service Vehicles as well as
 
04:55:15.070 --> 04:55:15.080 align:start position:0%
Personnel so there are two things that
 
04:55:18.270 --> 04:55:18.280 align:start position:0%
this piece of legislation wishes to
 
04:55:21.830 --> 04:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
accomplish uh one is to align our
 
04:55:25.270 --> 04:55:25.280 align:start position:0%
suspension and revocation process for
 
04:55:27.830 --> 04:55:27.840 align:start position:0%

um and Physicians and the second is as
 
04:55:37.910 --> 04:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
part of this promoting just culture um

license or suspend or revoke a license
 
04:56:16.910 --> 04:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
when the commissioner finds that the
 
04:56:18.910 --> 04:56:18.920 align:start position:0%
applicant is guilty of any of the
 
04:56:21.750 --> 04:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
following acts and offenses and it it
 
04:56:24.628 --> 04:56:24.638 align:start position:0%
lists out those but the key word in here
 
04:56:27.948 --> 04:56:27.958 align:start position:0%
is that the commissioner shall um deny
 
04:56:30.750 --> 04:56:30.760 align:start position:0%
and then again it provides a list and so
 
04:56:33.310 --> 04:56:33.320 align:start position:0%
this language does not align with the
 
04:56:35.190 --> 04:56:35.200 align:start position:0%
other medical professions within the
 
04:56:37.510 --> 04:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
state so if we look at Physicians and
 
04:56:41.270 --> 04:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
surgeons under chapter 3291
 
04:56:44.470 --> 04:56:44.480 align:start position:0%
17 um chapter 320 for the nurses it
 
04:56:48.070 --> 04:56:48.080 align:start position:0%
would be 326b of the nurse Practice
 
04:56:53.948 --> 04:56:53.958 align:start position:0%
Act oh we've got uh SEC b37 chapter 328d
 
04:56:57.030 --> 04:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
for Physicians assistance as also for
 
04:57:00.390 --> 04:57:00.400 align:start position:0%
dentists and Dentistry section 317
 
04:57:06.310 --> 04:57:06.320 align:start position:0%
a17 um they don't don't have shall they
 
04:57:11.750 --> 04:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
use May allowing for um discretion um
 
04:57:14.350 --> 04:57:14.360 align:start position:0%
and also promoting the ability to use
 
04:57:16.628 --> 04:57:16.638 align:start position:0%
just culture which again is pra so this
 
04:57:18.750 --> 04:57:18.760 align:start position:0%
is something when we talk about just
 
04:57:22.750 --> 04:57:22.760 align:start position:0%
culture this means that an act or an
 
04:57:26.350 --> 04:57:26.360 align:start position:0%
offense which could be is minor and does
 
04:57:28.150 --> 04:57:28.160 align:start position:0%
not at the discretion of the
 
04:57:31.430 --> 04:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner require suspension or lure
 
04:57:32.628 --> 04:57:32.638 align:start position:0%
but has been elevated to the
 
04:57:35.430 --> 04:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner's level he could instead of
 
04:57:38.670 --> 04:57:38.680 align:start position:0%
denying he or she denying or suspending
 
04:57:42.470 --> 04:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
A license they could put a letter of
 
04:57:45.948 --> 04:57:45.958 align:start position:0%
concern in the file um which is part of
 
04:57:49.230 --> 04:57:49.240 align:start position:0%
just culture which says this mistake was
 
04:57:52.510 --> 04:57:52.520 align:start position:0%
made um we this is how it has been
 
04:57:55.230 --> 04:57:55.240 align:start position:0%
remedied and here it exists in this
 
04:57:58.510 --> 04:57:58.520 align:start position:0%
person's file this is again a practice
 
04:58:01.310 --> 04:58:01.320 align:start position:0%
that um is found throughout Healthcare
 
04:58:03.548 --> 04:58:03.558 align:start position:0%
um and it promotes more openness more
 
04:58:06.708 --> 04:58:06.718 align:start position:0%
transparency and more opportunities um
 
04:58:10.750 --> 04:58:10.760 align:start position:0%
for learning so um with that again I'll
 
04:58:13.230 --> 04:58:13.240 align:start position:0%
I'll stop and just ask that you consider
 
04:58:16.628 --> 04:58:16.638 align:start position:0%
changing the language from shall to May
 
04:58:19.510 --> 04:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
um in 153 a13 give the commissioner of
 
04:58:21.150 --> 04:58:21.160 align:start position:0%
the discretion to issue letters of
 
04:58:23.548 --> 04:58:23.558 align:start position:0%
concern as Parts as a part of just
 
04:58:26.708 --> 04:58:26.718 align:start position:0%
culture um and this does not change the
 
04:58:29.350 --> 04:58:29.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner's ability to suspend or to
 
04:58:33.670 --> 04:58:33.680 align:start position:0%
revoke but at puts another key tool um
 
04:58:36.070 --> 04:58:36.080 align:start position:0%
in the toolbox for licensed
 
04:58:37.590 --> 04:58:37.600 align:start position:0%
professionals and Emergency Medical
 
04:58:39.670 --> 04:58:39.680 align:start position:0%
Services and puts it on the record
 
04:58:41.628 --> 04:58:41.638 align:start position:0%
should there be an issue that needs to
 
04:58:44.430 --> 04:58:44.440 align:start position:0%
be addressed thank you thank you any
 
04:58:50.230 --> 04:58:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:50.240 --> 04:58:52.230 align:start position:0%
 
Apprentice

04:58:52.230 --> 04:58:52.240 align:start position:0%
Apprentice
 
04:58:54.510 --> 04:58:54.520 align:start position:0%
seen representative
 
04:58:58.030 --> 04:58:58.040 align:start position:0%
Shu thank you Mr chair good afternoon
 
04:59:01.788 --> 04:59:01.798 align:start position:0%
Senator Apprentice um I'm curious uh
 
04:59:05.430 --> 04:59:05.440 align:start position:0%
when you were the head of Emergency
 
04:59:08.190 --> 04:59:08.200 align:start position:0%
Medical Services I understood that that
 
04:59:10.670 --> 04:59:10.680 align:start position:0%
was your position at one time did you
 
04:59:14.150 --> 04:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
encounter any instances where this would
 
04:59:16.590 --> 04:59:16.600 align:start position:0%
have been a tool that you would have
 
04:59:19.750 --> 04:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
used yes um I did encounter instances
 
04:59:21.948 --> 04:59:21.958 align:start position:0%
where was a tool that we could have used
 
04:59:23.990 --> 04:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
a good example so I haven't been in that
 
04:59:27.070 --> 04:59:27.080 align:start position:0%
position since 2010 so I'm going to use
 
04:59:31.750 --> 04:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
my memory here would be you would be um
 
04:59:34.070 --> 04:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
normally local medical directors work
 
04:59:36.030 --> 04:59:36.040 align:start position:0%
with local EMS professionals they know
 
04:59:38.150 --> 04:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
them the best and so let's say there
 
04:59:39.830 --> 04:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
were two medications that could be used
 
04:59:42.270 --> 04:59:42.280 align:start position:0%
for a certain problem one was used it
 
04:59:44.470 --> 04:59:44.480 align:start position:0%
wasn't the best choice it didn't hurt
 
04:59:45.830 --> 04:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
the patient but there would have been a
 
04:59:45.840 --> 04:59:46.708 align:start position:0%
the patient but there would have been a
better

04:59:46.708 --> 04:59:46.718 align:start position:0%
better
 
04:59:49.150 --> 04:59:49.160 align:start position:0%
choice a local medical director would
 
04:59:51.628 --> 04:59:51.638 align:start position:0%
normally handle that but if for some
 
04:59:53.750 --> 04:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
reason somebody decided to write a
 
04:59:56.190 --> 04:59:56.200 align:start position:0%
complaint that came to the
 
04:59:57.868 --> 04:59:57.878 align:start position:0%
commissioner's office or to the Bureau
 
05:00:00.150 --> 05:00:00.160 align:start position:0%
of EMS and mul to the commissioner then
 
05:00:02.590 --> 05:00:02.600 align:start position:0%
their only opportunity to act on this
 
05:00:06.030 --> 05:00:06.040 align:start position:0%
would be to deny would be to suspend or
 
05:00:08.830 --> 05:00:08.840 align:start position:0%
revoke um and that doesn't promote good
 
05:00:10.590 --> 05:00:10.600 align:start position:0%
patient it doesn't promote safety it
 
05:00:13.070 --> 05:00:13.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't promote transparency um and it's
 
05:00:15.230 --> 05:00:15.240 align:start position:0%
and it really is limiting where if this
 
05:00:17.430 --> 05:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
sort to happen in again in an
 
05:00:19.788 --> 05:00:19.798 align:start position:0%
organization and happen locally it would
 
05:00:22.990 --> 05:00:23.000 align:start position:0%
be handled it would be documented um and
 
05:00:24.868 --> 05:00:24.878 align:start position:0%
we would all be better for that so that
 
05:00:27.590 --> 05:00:27.600 align:start position:0%
would be the kind of example that um we
 
05:00:30.510 --> 05:00:30.520 align:start position:0%
had come before us that we we were we
 
05:00:34.110 --> 05:00:34.120 align:start position:0%
were limited on how to um on how to
 
05:00:36.470 --> 05:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
manage thank you I think that gives us a
 
05:00:38.670 --> 05:00:38.680 align:start position:0%
better handle on what we're talking
 
05:00:41.628 --> 05:00:41.638 align:start position:0%
about here yeah thank thank you
 
05:00:41.638 --> 05:00:43.230 align:start position:0%
about here yeah thank thank you
representative

05:00:43.230 --> 05:00:43.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:00:47.030 --> 05:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
fellows uh thank you Mr chair um M I
 
05:00:48.350 --> 05:00:48.360 align:start position:0%
have two
 
05:00:51.628 --> 05:00:51.638 align:start position:0%
questions one of them the letter of
 
05:00:54.230 --> 05:00:54.240 align:start position:0%
concern is that something that goes in
 
05:00:57.990 --> 05:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
their file or what happens with that
 
05:01:01.310 --> 05:01:01.320 align:start position:0%
letter I have a followup question too
 
05:01:02.910 --> 05:01:02.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely so Madam Cher if it's okay
 
05:01:04.190 --> 05:01:04.200 align:start position:0%
I'll take
 
05:01:10.390 --> 05:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
both Pro proed or or sorry whoever um so
 
05:01:12.868 --> 05:01:12.878 align:start position:0%
they the licensed professional would get
 
05:01:15.590 --> 05:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
a copy U and then it would also be part
 
05:01:17.030 --> 05:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
of the record in the Bureau of Emergency
 
05:01:17.040 --> 05:01:18.350 align:start position:0%
of the record in the Bureau of Emergency
Medical

05:01:18.350 --> 05:01:18.360 align:start position:0%
Medical
 
05:01:22.190 --> 05:01:22.200 align:start position:0%
Services okay and my followup question
 
05:01:26.670 --> 05:01:26.680 align:start position:0%
is if you change the shall to May that
 
05:01:28.190 --> 05:01:28.200 align:start position:0%
opens up the
 
05:01:32.548 --> 05:01:32.558 align:start position:0%
possibility that a person who is guilty
 
05:01:35.708 --> 05:01:35.718 align:start position:0%
of any of the following Acts or offenses
 
05:01:38.230 --> 05:01:38.240 align:start position:0%
that the action taken is nothing at all
 
05:01:40.150 --> 05:01:40.160 align:start position:0%
because the May means you don't have to
 
05:01:43.270 --> 05:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
do any of these is that your intent no
 
05:01:45.470 --> 05:01:45.480 align:start position:0%
it's not our intent but it's our intent
 
05:01:48.990 --> 05:01:49.000 align:start position:0%
to give flexibility to the commissioner
 
05:01:51.910 --> 05:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
um to make the decision whether it's
 
05:01:54.150 --> 05:01:54.160 align:start position:0%
whether they'll take one of these three
 
05:01:56.868 --> 05:01:56.878 align:start position:0%
actions instead of nothing at all or
 
05:02:00.310 --> 05:02:00.320 align:start position:0%
only have two um it's never been my
 
05:02:01.868 --> 05:02:01.878 align:start position:0%
experience and I have been out of this
 
05:02:04.430 --> 05:02:04.440 align:start position:0%
position for a while that when there was
 
05:02:06.868 --> 05:02:06.878 align:start position:0%
an issue that needed to be dealt with
 
05:02:09.548 --> 05:02:09.558 align:start position:0%
that it wasn't handled appropriately so
 
05:02:11.590 --> 05:02:11.600 align:start position:0%
they'll they can still suspend or revoke
 
05:02:14.590 --> 05:02:14.600 align:start position:0%
and they would be in a I would I can't
 
05:02:17.190 --> 05:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
imagine a position or a situation where
 
05:02:18.948 --> 05:02:18.958 align:start position:0%
if they had if they were guilty or what
 
05:02:20.990 --> 05:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
is called founded in the licensure
 
05:02:22.430 --> 05:02:22.440 align:start position:0%
process that they wouldn't take one of
 
05:02:22.440 --> 05:02:23.510 align:start position:0%
process that they wouldn't take one of
those

05:02:23.510 --> 05:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
those
 
05:02:25.948 --> 05:02:25.958 align:start position:0%
actions well I'm not a commissioner I
 
05:02:28.708 --> 05:02:28.718 align:start position:0%
can't speak for them but that's what my
 
05:02:32.150 --> 05:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
what I would do so just followup follow
 
05:02:32.160 --> 05:02:33.390 align:start position:0%
what I would do so just followup follow
up

05:02:33.390 --> 05:02:33.400 align:start position:0%
up
 
05:02:37.470 --> 05:02:37.480 align:start position:0%
so the way I read it is that if that
 
05:02:40.830 --> 05:02:40.840 align:start position:0%
word shall stays there you will get
 
05:02:43.708 --> 05:02:43.718 align:start position:0%
exactly what you just explained putting
 
05:02:46.830 --> 05:02:46.840 align:start position:0%
the word May in there gives them the
 
05:02:50.070 --> 05:02:50.080 align:start position:0%
option to do none of those things do you
 
05:02:53.788 --> 05:02:53.798 align:start position:0%
do you see that or um I understand what
 
05:02:56.070 --> 05:02:56.080 align:start position:0%
you're saying but I I don't I don't
 
05:02:58.470 --> 05:02:58.480 align:start position:0%
necess I don't necessarily agree the
 
05:03:01.470 --> 05:03:01.480 align:start position:0%
intent is not to wipe the Slate clean it
 
05:03:04.830 --> 05:03:04.840 align:start position:0%
is to provide discretion and in the very
 
05:03:06.788 --> 05:03:06.798 align:start position:0%
beginning representative Fells if I may
 
05:03:10.110 --> 05:03:10.120 align:start position:0%
I mentioned that or I stated that
 
05:03:13.548 --> 05:03:13.558 align:start position:0%
nursing uh Physicians other health care
 
05:03:16.868 --> 05:03:16.878 align:start position:0%
professions their boards not not
 
05:03:18.510 --> 05:03:18.520 align:start position:0%
Commissioners but they have Boards of
 
05:03:21.510 --> 05:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
oversight that do the same kind of work
 
05:03:23.190 --> 05:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
they have that same language they're
 
05:03:25.670 --> 05:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
given that same discretion and so if
 
05:03:27.548 --> 05:03:27.558 align:start position:0%
they're providing patient care and so as
 
05:03:29.868 --> 05:03:29.878 align:start position:0%
Emergency Medical Services again I can't
 
05:03:31.670 --> 05:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
see how this would be any handled any
 
05:03:34.510 --> 05:03:34.520 align:start position:0%
differently okay thank you you are so
 
05:03:39.110 --> 05:03:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:41.990 --> 05:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
Apprentice see none uh is there anyone
 
05:03:43.948 --> 05:03:43.958 align:start position:0%
else who'd like to speak on this bill
 
05:03:46.548 --> 05:03:46.558 align:start position:0%
the section of this
 
05:03:49.788 --> 05:03:49.798 align:start position:0%
bill okay uh director
 
05:03:52.390 --> 05:03:52.400 align:start position:0%

05:03:53.510 --> 05:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
unmute
 
05:03:56.590 --> 05:03:56.600 align:start position:0%
yourself good afternoon thank you sir um
 
05:03:58.350 --> 05:03:58.360 align:start position:0%
again my name is Justin romanell I'm the
 
05:04:00.070 --> 05:04:00.080 align:start position:0%
chief the Bureau of Ems for the State of
 
05:04:03.110 --> 05:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and um I don't want to
 
05:04:05.030 --> 05:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
Echo everything that c Senator
 
05:04:07.788 --> 05:04:07.798 align:start position:0%
Apprentice said um but the the tool here
 
05:04:10.350 --> 05:04:10.360 align:start position:0%
is is to give the commissioner a few
 
05:04:13.070 --> 05:04:13.080 align:start position:0%
options um what we've done in the in the
 
05:04:15.190 --> 05:04:15.200 align:start position:0%
past or what what he has done in the
 
05:04:19.708 --> 05:04:19.718 align:start position:0%
past is um in a case where uh we we
 
05:04:22.030 --> 05:04:22.040 align:start position:0%
intend for the letter of concern to be
 
05:04:25.270 --> 05:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
used um we've what we've done is he's
 
05:04:28.910 --> 05:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
he's either a revoked the license or
 
05:04:31.788 --> 05:04:31.798 align:start position:0%
suspended a license in abeyance um and
 
05:04:34.030 --> 05:04:34.040 align:start position:0%
so it's still on the individual's record
 
05:04:35.910 --> 05:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
um but they wouldn't actually have an
 
05:04:39.310 --> 05:04:39.320 align:start position:0%
action taken um directly on their
 
05:04:41.548 --> 05:04:41.558 align:start position:0%
license unless theyve they've committed
 
05:04:44.230 --> 05:04:44.240 align:start position:0%
a a follow-up action in a in a time per
 
05:04:46.910 --> 05:04:46.920 align:start position:0%
period that was determined um so where I
 
05:04:50.548 --> 05:04:50.558 align:start position:0%
see this being utilized would be um in
 
05:04:52.350 --> 05:04:52.360 align:start position:0%
cases that we have may have done that in
 
05:04:54.310 --> 05:04:54.320 align:start position:0%
the past and I apologize I I don't have
 
05:04:57.670 --> 05:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
an example for you um but where an
 
05:05:00.510 --> 05:05:00.520 align:start position:0%
action may not have been Justified to
 
05:05:03.030 --> 05:05:03.040 align:start position:0%
take against the license
 
05:05:04.470 --> 05:05:04.480 align:start position:0%
where a letter of concern would have
 
05:05:06.750 --> 05:05:06.760 align:start position:0%
been more appropriate for that
 
05:05:09.430 --> 05:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
individual but the only option that the
 
05:05:11.230 --> 05:05:11.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner had at the time was to take
 
05:05:13.430 --> 05:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
the action against the license um as
 
05:05:16.390 --> 05:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
Senator Apprentice did say um you know
 
05:05:21.030 --> 05:05:21.040 align:start position:0%
we're not trying to to um give the
 
05:05:23.830 --> 05:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner the flexibility to not act
 
05:05:26.670 --> 05:05:26.680 align:start position:0%
just to act more appropriately um and
 
05:05:28.868 --> 05:05:28.878 align:start position:0%
provide those those those options for
 
05:05:31.708 --> 05:05:31.718 align:start position:0%
him or her um also as Senator prus
 
05:05:33.110 --> 05:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned you know you know what we also
 
05:05:35.230 --> 05:05:35.240 align:start position:0%
are trying to do is is is create that
 
05:05:38.110 --> 05:05:38.120 align:start position:0%
just culture um I I think what keeps me
 
05:05:40.270 --> 05:05:40.280 align:start position:0%
up more at night is is the stuff we
 
05:05:42.390 --> 05:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
don't hear about um and the stuff that
 
05:05:45.470 --> 05:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
people are afraid to to to to give us as
 
05:05:48.270 --> 05:05:48.280 align:start position:0%
far as complaints um for us to perform
 
05:05:51.390 --> 05:05:51.400 align:start position:0%
in investigation um because of the only
 
05:05:54.548 --> 05:05:54.558 align:start position:0%
options that that are had are in fact a
 
05:05:57.310 --> 05:05:57.320 align:start position:0%
revocation or a suspension um so I think
 
05:06:00.628 --> 05:06:00.638 align:start position:0%
by changing the the word into May um
 
05:06:02.470 --> 05:06:02.480 align:start position:0%
from Sha and adding the letter of
 
05:06:05.350 --> 05:06:05.360 align:start position:0%
concern as as a tool um this will put us
 
05:06:07.070 --> 05:06:07.080 align:start position:0%
more in line with the other health care
 
05:06:08.590 --> 05:06:08.600 align:start position:0%
professions that Senator Apprentice
 
05:06:12.150 --> 05:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned um in thus create in that same
 
05:06:14.030 --> 05:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
just culture that we we see in those
 
05:06:16.230 --> 05:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
Industries um I appreciate the time and
 
05:06:18.110 --> 05:06:18.120 align:start position:0%
conly answer any questions if anybody
 
05:06:24.470 --> 05:06:24.480 align:start position:0%

our representative McGuire to speak on
 
05:07:18.110 --> 05:07:18.120 align:start position:0%
it thank you I'm Carol McGuire
 
05:07:20.750 --> 05:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
representing merac District 29 which is
 
05:07:23.150 --> 05:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
the towns of Allenstown Epsom and
 
05:07:27.628 --> 05:07:27.638 align:start position:0%
Pittsfield and part 11 is a change to
 
05:07:31.310 --> 05:07:31.320 align:start position:0%
the definition of a school for barbering
 
05:07:35.670 --> 05:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
cosmetology M by allowing a dedicated
 
05:07:38.990 --> 05:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
program to be counted as a school and
 
05:07:41.190 --> 05:07:41.200 align:start position:0%
it's not doesn't have to be a completely
 
05:07:41.200 --> 05:07:42.788 align:start position:0%
it's not doesn't have to be a completely
independent

05:07:42.788 --> 05:07:42.798 align:start position:0%
independent
 
05:07:45.190 --> 05:07:45.200 align:start position:0%
program for example you could have a
 
05:07:49.750 --> 05:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
dedicated program within a high school
 
05:07:51.470 --> 05:07:51.480 align:start position:0%
and I believe that's one of the places
 
05:07:53.590 --> 05:07:53.600 align:start position:0%
where they're interested in
 
05:07:56.590 --> 05:07:56.600 align:start position:0%
it it also
 
05:08:00.708 --> 05:08:00.718 align:start position:0%
aot requires a Apprentice in such a
 
05:08:03.230 --> 05:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
program to register with the board Bo
 
05:08:06.628 --> 05:08:06.638 align:start position:0%
and gets an apprentice
 
05:08:11.190 --> 05:08:11.200 align:start position:0%
certificate which is of identification
 
05:08:14.510 --> 05:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
shows their age and that they're of good
 
05:08:17.590 --> 05:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
professional character which is easier
 
05:08:20.590 --> 05:08:20.600 align:start position:0%
and so it allows
 
05:08:23.708 --> 05:08:23.718 align:start position:0%
uh apprentices to
 
05:08:28.390 --> 05:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
start and to work with
 
05:08:31.868 --> 05:08:31.878 align:start position:0%
um as apprenticeships in the program and
 
05:08:34.310 --> 05:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
the board retains the authority to set
 
05:08:37.788 --> 05:08:37.798 align:start position:0%
the rules and once they complete the
 
05:08:42.470 --> 05:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:47.510 --> 05:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:50.070 --> 05:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
this any questions if so please raise
 
05:08:50.080 --> 05:08:53.190 align:start position:0%
this any questions if so please raise
your

05:08:53.190 --> 05:08:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:56.350 --> 05:08:56.360 align:start position:0%
hand I see none does anyone else wish to
 
05:09:01.110 --> 05:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:05.948 --> 05:09:05.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:09.430 --> 05:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you Mr chair uh just a
 
05:09:13.270 --> 05:09:13.280 align:start position:0%
quick question as we had had a bill uh
 
05:09:15.590 --> 05:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
dealing with this subject in committee
 
05:09:18.110 --> 05:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
prior that is on its way to the Senate
 
05:09:20.670 --> 05:09:20.680 align:start position:0%
um the languages do not mirror each
 
05:09:27.350 --> 05:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:30.350 --> 05:09:30.360 align:start position:0%
pass that's a excellent question and I
 
05:09:34.708 --> 05:09:34.718 align:start position:0%
think it will be a an issue
 
05:09:37.590 --> 05:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
um the part about the
 
05:09:40.788 --> 05:09:40.798 align:start position:0%
school or a section of a school program
 
05:09:44.548 --> 05:09:44.558 align:start position:0%
within a school is unique to the LIC to
 
05:09:47.030 --> 05:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
this bill and it wouldn't be affected
 
05:09:50.110 --> 05:09:50.120 align:start position:0%
either way
 
05:09:53.868 --> 05:09:53.878 align:start position:0%
um the rest of it I I you have
 
05:09:56.590 --> 05:09:56.600 align:start position:0%
identified an issue that needs to be
 
05:10:01.030 --> 05:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:01.040 --> 05:10:03.510 align:start position:0%
 
you

05:10:03.510 --> 05:10:03.520 align:start position:0%

05:10:13.310 --> 05:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
and good afternoon chairman and members
 
05:10:15.310 --> 05:10:15.320 align:start position:0%
of the committee so for the record I'm
 
05:10:17.270 --> 05:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
Tom Brodrick legal counsel at the office
 
05:10:19.430 --> 05:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
of professional lure and certification
 
05:10:22.350 --> 05:10:22.360 align:start position:0%
or oplc um and as you know the oplc
 
05:10:24.150 --> 05:10:24.160 align:start position:0%
provides administrative and clerical
 
05:10:27.030 --> 05:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
support um for the approximately or the
 
05:10:29.390 --> 05:10:29.400 align:start position:0%
for the 54 occupational licensing boards
 
05:10:31.030 --> 05:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
commissions and councils under our
 
05:10:33.070 --> 05:10:33.080 align:start position:0%
umbrella so I'm here now to speak on
 
05:10:36.510 --> 05:10:36.520 align:start position:0%
Section 11 of SB 133 uh be begins on the
 
05:10:39.270 --> 05:10:39.280 align:start position:0%
bottom of page 49 and ends on the page
 
05:10:42.070 --> 05:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
50 um this bill affects the Board of
 
05:10:43.910 --> 05:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
barbering cosmetology and Aesthetics but
 
05:10:45.670 --> 05:10:45.680 align:start position:0%
I want to make clear right now I'm
 
05:10:48.270 --> 05:10:48.280 align:start position:0%
speaking on behalf of the board not or
 
05:10:50.708 --> 05:10:50.718 align:start position:0%
sorry of the oplc the agency not the
 
05:10:52.390 --> 05:10:52.400 align:start position:0%
board I've consulted with the board on
 
05:10:54.830 --> 05:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
this process they're aware of this um
 
05:10:58.270 --> 05:10:58.280 align:start position:0%
but I'm speaking for the agency so oplc
 
05:11:00.628 --> 05:11:00.638 align:start position:0%
actually we requested this change after
 
05:11:02.670 --> 05:11:02.680 align:start position:0%
consultation with the board really to
 
05:11:06.470 --> 05:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
fix and or to clarifi clarify two issues
 
05:11:09.310 --> 05:11:09.320 align:start position:0%
with the board's Practice Act both
 
05:11:11.310 --> 05:11:11.320 align:start position:0%
issues concerns the board's authority to
 
05:11:14.350 --> 05:11:14.360 align:start position:0%
regulate programs within high schools so
 
05:11:16.510 --> 05:11:16.520 align:start position:0%
the board actually currently licenses
 
05:11:19.788 --> 05:11:19.798 align:start position:0%
Independent Schools um such as Tom
 
05:11:22.310 --> 05:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
Brodrick School of Barbering um but it
 
05:11:24.510 --> 05:11:24.520 align:start position:0%
also licenses a few programs within high
 
05:11:26.430 --> 05:11:26.440 align:start position:0%
schools so for instance conquered high
 
05:11:28.670 --> 05:11:28.680 align:start position:0%
school has a cosmetology program where
 
05:11:30.430 --> 05:11:30.440 align:start position:0%
students get an apprentice license from
 
05:11:32.708 --> 05:11:32.718 align:start position:0%
the board and learn cos mology at the
 
05:11:35.390 --> 05:11:35.400 align:start position:0%
high school the first issue that this
 
05:11:37.708 --> 05:11:37.718 align:start position:0%
legislation is seeking to resolve is
 
05:11:39.230 --> 05:11:39.240 align:start position:0%
clarification as to whether the board
 
05:11:40.628 --> 05:11:40.638 align:start position:0%
has the authority to license and
 
05:11:43.150 --> 05:11:43.160 align:start position:0%
regulate programs within high schools
 
05:11:46.590 --> 05:11:46.600 align:start position:0%
rather than just Independent Schools um
 
05:11:47.788 --> 05:11:47.798 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned earlier the board
 
05:11:49.670 --> 05:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
currently does so and has for a long
 
05:11:52.590 --> 05:11:52.600 align:start position:0%
time um the confusion comes from uh a
 
05:11:54.350 --> 05:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
discrepancy between the definition of
 
05:11:57.590 --> 05:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
school in RSA 3113
 
05:12:00.868 --> 05:12:00.878 align:start position:0%
a112 which is Broad um and reads just
 
05:12:02.868 --> 05:12:02.878 align:start position:0%
School means a school or other
 
05:12:04.750 --> 05:12:04.760 align:start position:0%
institution conducted for the purpose of
 
05:12:06.948 --> 05:12:06.958 align:start position:0%
teaching cosmetology manicuring
 
05:12:11.470 --> 05:12:11.480 align:start position:0%
barbering or Aesthetics versus RSA 313
 
05:12:13.948 --> 05:12:13.958 align:start position:0%
a72 which reads the board May license a
 
05:12:16.510 --> 05:12:16.520 align:start position:0%
school to operate postsecondary programs
 
05:12:18.670 --> 05:12:18.680 align:start position:0%
including post-secondary programs
 
05:12:20.470 --> 05:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
leading to a certificate in barbering
 
05:12:24.548 --> 05:12:24.558 align:start position:0%
cosmetology and Aesthetics so
 
05:12:28.190 --> 05:12:28.200 align:start position:0%
um we have one statute that that says
 
05:12:29.788 --> 05:12:29.798 align:start position:0%
the board May license
 
05:12:32.430 --> 05:12:32.440 align:start position:0%
schools and schools are Broad and then
 
05:12:33.868 --> 05:12:33.878 align:start position:0%
another statute that says they may
 
05:12:36.750 --> 05:12:36.760 align:start position:0%
license schools to operate postsecondary
 
05:12:39.670 --> 05:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
programs and um
 
05:12:43.628 --> 05:12:43.638 align:start position:0%
so in this bill Pages L uh page 49 lines
 
05:12:47.150 --> 05:12:47.160 align:start position:0%
23 21 through 33 are really seeking to
 
05:12:49.430 --> 05:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
resolve the ambiguity and make clear
 
05:12:51.470 --> 05:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
that the board may may continue to
 
05:12:53.590 --> 05:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
license and regulate the programs within
 
05:12:54.470 --> 05:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
the high
 
05:12:57.030 --> 05:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
schools um the second issue that this
 
05:12:59.910 --> 05:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
legislation is seeking to resolve is a
 
05:13:02.628 --> 05:13:02.638 align:start position:0%
little bit more complicated so the the
 
05:13:06.310 --> 05:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
child protection statute 161
 
05:13:09.350 --> 05:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
b16a oplc and really any other state
 
05:13:11.670 --> 05:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
agency is required to collect the social
 
05:13:13.868 --> 05:13:13.878 align:start position:0%
security number of any applicant for a
 
05:13:17.270 --> 05:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
professional license um but for these
 
05:13:18.990 --> 05:13:19.000 align:start position:0%
students specifically the students
 
05:13:21.390 --> 05:13:21.400 align:start position:0%
within high schools um within public
 
05:13:24.110 --> 05:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
high schools under I believe it's furpa
 
05:13:27.390 --> 05:13:27.400 align:start position:0%
um the school the school cannot require
 
05:13:28.830 --> 05:13:28.840 align:start position:0%
a student to provide their social
 
05:13:31.190 --> 05:13:31.200 align:start position:0%
security number so we have a bit of a
 
05:13:32.510 --> 05:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
catch 20
 
05:13:34.788 --> 05:13:34.798 align:start position:0%
where the school cannot require cannot
 
05:13:37.590 --> 05:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
request a social security number um but
 
05:13:39.830 --> 05:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
the board must require it if if we're
 
05:13:42.390 --> 05:13:42.400 align:start position:0%
saying these students need to have an
 
05:13:44.510 --> 05:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
apprentice license with the board or
 
05:13:47.310 --> 05:13:47.320 align:start position:0%
Apprentice certificate with the board um
 
05:13:49.150 --> 05:13:49.160 align:start position:0%
so the remainder of this bill which is
 
05:13:53.270 --> 05:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
page 49 lines 34 to page 50 lines 23 is
 
05:13:57.190 --> 05:13:57.200 align:start position:0%
meant to fix this issue um so in short
 
05:14:00.310 --> 05:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
that section is meant to exempt those
 
05:14:02.190 --> 05:14:02.200 align:start position:0%
applying for these Apprentice
 
05:14:04.390 --> 05:14:04.400 align:start position:0%
certificates from the requirement to
 
05:14:07.230 --> 05:14:07.240 align:start position:0%
provide a social security number um that
 
05:14:08.948 --> 05:14:08.958 align:start position:0%
concludes my public testimony the one
 
05:14:11.350 --> 05:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
thing I'll add is representative goalie
 
05:14:15.190 --> 05:14:15.200 align:start position:0%
I was unable to hear your question um
 
05:14:18.110 --> 05:14:18.120 align:start position:0%
because I was being promoted to panelist
 
05:14:20.150 --> 05:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
so um if there's something I can answer
 
05:14:22.830 --> 05:14:22.840 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to to do my best
 
05:14:27.750 --> 05:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:31.070 --> 05:14:31.080 align:start position:0%
questions representative goie yes I just
 
05:14:34.150 --> 05:14:34.160 align:start position:0%
want to repeat my uh statement or my
 
05:14:37.230 --> 05:14:37.240 align:start position:0%
question was that if this and the bill
 
05:14:38.788 --> 05:14:38.798 align:start position:0%
that was currently before the house
 
05:14:40.788 --> 05:14:40.798 align:start position:0%
committee that's off into the Senate
 
05:14:43.110 --> 05:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
dealing with the sub subject matter both
 
05:14:49.430 --> 05:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:54.030 --> 05:14:54.040 align:start position:0%
issue all right I um it I'm not clear on
 
05:14:56.868 --> 05:14:56.878 align:start position:0%
which bill that is but I'm happy to I
 
05:14:59.590 --> 05:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
believe it's House Bill
 
05:15:02.190 --> 05:15:02.200 align:start position:0%
575 all right I'm I'm happy to look into
 
05:15:06.150 --> 05:15:06.160 align:start position:0%
that and get back to the committee okay
 
05:15:11.628 --> 05:15:11.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:14.070 --> 05:15:14.080 align:start position:0%

05:15:59.230 --> 05:15:59.240 align:start position:0%
this work
 
05:16:03.150 --> 05:16:03.160 align:start position:0%
with approvals made by the Department of
 
05:16:06.070 --> 05:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
Education of vocational

05:16:13.750 --> 05:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
together um I would have to get back to
 
05:16:15.430 --> 05:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
you on that I I know I've looked into
 
05:16:16.910 --> 05:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
that a little bit for the electricians
 
05:16:19.628 --> 05:16:19.638 align:start position:0%
who have have some vog programs and also
 
05:16:21.628 --> 05:16:21.638 align:start position:0%
the board I haven't specifically looked
 
05:16:25.070 --> 05:16:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:27.390 --> 05:16:27.400 align:start position:0%
cosmetology and I I have one more
 
05:16:30.788 --> 05:16:30.798 align:start position:0%
follow-up question followup yeah um
 
05:16:32.190 --> 05:16:32.200 align:start position:0%
right now
 
05:16:35.628 --> 05:16:35.638 align:start position:0%
do the students who graduate from
 
05:16:39.270 --> 05:16:39.280 align:start position:0%
those high school vocational programs
 
05:16:41.590 --> 05:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
how did they go about getting their
 
05:16:44.230 --> 05:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
apprentice license do they just get it
 
05:16:47.590 --> 05:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
automatically because they completed the
 
05:16:53.350 --> 05:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
program or what I believe um I believe
 
05:16:55.430 --> 05:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
when I believe they get their apprentice
 
05:16:57.070 --> 05:16:57.080 align:start position:0%
license when they're in the program and
 
05:16:59.270 --> 05:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
that's actually leading to one of the
 
05:17:02.270 --> 05:17:02.280 align:start position:0%
issues is um to get their apprentice
 
05:17:04.670 --> 05:17:04.680 align:start position:0%
license they are supposed to give us
 
05:17:06.948 --> 05:17:06.958 align:start position:0%
their social security number but the
 
05:17:08.948 --> 05:17:08.958 align:start position:0%
school cannot ask for their social
 
05:17:15.310 --> 05:17:15.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:19.150 --> 05:17:19.160 align:start position:0%
furpa any those licenses are you giving
 
05:17:21.230 --> 05:17:21.240 align:start position:0%
them those licenses right
 
05:17:24.350 --> 05:17:24.360 align:start position:0%
now I I believe we are I need to double
 
05:17:25.948 --> 05:17:25.958 align:start position:0%
check with administrator but I believe
 
05:17:28.150 --> 05:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
we are okay thank
 
05:17:30.390 --> 05:17:30.400 align:start position:0%

05:21:12.708 --> 05:21:12.718 align:start position:0%
of the committee and uh maybe I I know
 
05:21:14.868 --> 05:21:14.878 align:start position:0%
Dr Warner wants to testify as well so
 
05:21:17.670 --> 05:21:17.680 align:start position:0%
maybe this will give her time to um
 
05:21:20.830 --> 05:21:20.840 align:start position:0%
unmute but U again for the record I'm
 
05:21:24.830 --> 05:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
Tom Brodrick legal counsil of OPC uh I'm
 
05:21:27.110 --> 05:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
speaking now on behalf of the oplc not
 
05:21:29.310 --> 05:21:29.320 align:start position:0%
the board of psychologists I believe Dr
 
05:21:33.190 --> 05:21:33.200 align:start position:0%
Warner is here to speak um from that
 
05:21:35.350 --> 05:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
perspective um
 
05:21:38.670 --> 05:21:38.680 align:start position:0%
so uh I wanted to testify today to to
 
05:21:40.350 --> 05:21:40.360 align:start position:0%
put forward the oplc we're really
 
05:21:42.750 --> 05:21:42.760 align:start position:0%
neutral on this piece of legislation uh
 
05:21:44.270 --> 05:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
the reason I'm here is to provide an
 
05:21:46.350 --> 05:21:46.360 align:start position:0%
explanation of the bill and its effect
 
05:21:48.310 --> 05:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
on the in administration the board which
 
05:21:51.270 --> 05:21:51.280 align:start position:0%
is um the administration the board is
 
05:21:54.150 --> 05:21:54.160 align:start position:0%
opl's charge so this piece of
 
05:21:56.070 --> 05:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
legislation creates a new license
 
05:21:58.910 --> 05:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
category a New Hampshire telepath the
 
05:22:00.628 --> 05:22:00.638 align:start position:0%
intention of which is to allow out ofate
 
05:22:02.910 --> 05:22:02.920 align:start position:0%
Psych ologists an easier way to provide
 
05:22:05.270 --> 05:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
Psy psychologist Services via remote
 
05:22:08.670 --> 05:22:08.680 align:start position:0%
technology in New Hampshire um as of now
 
05:22:10.430 --> 05:22:10.440 align:start position:0%
there's there's currently two ways that
 
05:22:11.948 --> 05:22:11.958 align:start position:0%
individuals from another state can
 
05:22:13.948 --> 05:22:13.958 align:start position:0%
provide teles Psychology Services in New
 
05:22:15.948 --> 05:22:15.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire first they can go through the
 
05:22:18.070 --> 05:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
regular lure process to get license here
 
05:22:20.948 --> 05:22:20.958 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire um that is a lengthier
 
05:22:23.750 --> 05:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
process or or two New Hampshire has
 
05:22:26.868 --> 05:22:26.878 align:start position:0%
joined the interstate compact uh cact I
 
05:22:28.948 --> 05:22:28.958 align:start position:0%
know we've heard a lot of about compacts
 
05:22:31.910 --> 05:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
today um so if there home state is also
 
05:22:34.110 --> 05:22:34.120 align:start position:0%
a member of cypa they can obtain the
 
05:22:37.030 --> 05:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
interstate compact license and come here
 
05:22:39.270 --> 05:22:39.280 align:start position:0%
or and practice in New Hampshire which
 
05:22:42.750 --> 05:22:42.760 align:start position:0%
includes tele telepractice so this would
 
05:22:46.150 --> 05:22:46.160 align:start position:0%
really create a third Third Avenue um
 
05:22:48.230 --> 05:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
the main effect on opl's Administration
 
05:22:51.070 --> 05:22:51.080 align:start position:0%
the boards are as follows so first as I
 
05:22:52.868 --> 05:22:52.878 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier it creates an entirely
 
05:22:55.590 --> 05:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
new lure category it it is an increased
 
05:22:57.430 --> 05:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
administrative burden as it involves
 
05:22:59.628 --> 05:22:59.638 align:start position:0%
granting a new set of initial licenses
 
05:23:02.470 --> 05:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
renewals um drafting new rules for this
 
05:23:02.480 --> 05:23:04.070 align:start position:0%
renewals um drafting new rules for this
process

05:23:04.070 --> 05:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
process
 
05:23:06.948 --> 05:23:06.958 align:start position:0%
um we're not oplc is not necessarily
 
05:23:08.548 --> 05:23:08.558 align:start position:0%
against the bill for this reason and we
 
05:23:10.110 --> 05:23:10.120 align:start position:0%
of course we'll implement it if the bill
 
05:23:12.590 --> 05:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
is passed um we want to make wanted to
 
05:23:14.750 --> 05:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
make this committee aware though
 
05:23:19.510 --> 05:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
um second uh opl's second effect uh
 
05:23:21.868 --> 05:23:21.878 align:start position:0%
dovetails with this so the the board
 
05:23:24.030 --> 05:23:24.040 align:start position:0%
joined the interstate compact in
 
05:23:27.270 --> 05:23:27.280 align:start position:0%
September 2019 less than two years ago
 
05:23:29.948 --> 05:23:29.958 align:start position:0%
uh it last I checked 14 states joined it
 
05:23:31.430 --> 05:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
might be 16
 
05:23:34.150 --> 05:23:34.160 align:start position:0%
uh and are active in the compact
 
05:23:36.628 --> 05:23:36.638 align:start position:0%
um I think one more has joined but the
 
05:23:38.590 --> 05:23:38.600 align:start position:0%
legislation isn't yet effective and 13
 
05:23:40.708 --> 05:23:40.718 align:start position:0%
more states are pending legislation this
 
05:23:44.070 --> 05:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
year so that's 28 States um from what
 
05:23:45.430 --> 05:23:45.440 align:start position:0%
we've seen with other compacts the
 
05:23:47.510 --> 05:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
number of states that joined once a
 
05:23:50.350 --> 05:23:50.360 align:start position:0%
compact meets that threshold uh that
 
05:23:52.948 --> 05:23:52.958 align:start position:0%
initial threshold to become active um
 
05:23:56.270 --> 05:23:56.280 align:start position:0%
will only be will only increase so for
 
05:23:59.070 --> 05:23:59.080 align:start position:0%
lies coming from these compact seates
 
05:24:01.030 --> 05:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
the bill is largely unnecessary and
 
05:24:03.270 --> 05:24:03.280 align:start position:0%
redundant um and may actually be more
 
05:24:05.868 --> 05:24:05.878 align:start position:0%
confusing to individuals I do understand
 
05:24:07.788 --> 05:24:07.798 align:start position:0%
that um this tella Health would likely
 
05:24:10.548 --> 05:24:10.558 align:start position:0%
have a lower fee than a compact fee um
 
05:24:12.788 --> 05:24:12.798 align:start position:0%
but it isn't redundant for those from
 
05:24:18.110 --> 05:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
non-compact States um so um and just
 
05:24:20.190 --> 05:24:20.200 align:start position:0%
lastly I know my executive director
 
05:24:23.310 --> 05:24:23.320 align:start position:0%
Lindsay Courtney has spoken to uh Dr
 
05:24:27.270 --> 05:24:27.280 align:start position:0%
Warner and she may be testifying and um
 
05:24:30.070 --> 05:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
again I want to make clear we are we're
 
05:24:32.990 --> 05:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
neutral on this bill um but we did want
 
05:24:34.910 --> 05:24:34.920 align:start position:0%
the committee to know those two pieces
 
05:24:39.548 --> 05:24:39.558 align:start position:0%
so this concludes my testimony um happy
 
05:24:42.590 --> 05:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
to take any questions representative
 
05:24:45.628 --> 05:24:45.638 align:start position:0%
schelz thank you um and thank you for
 
05:24:50.230 --> 05:24:50.240 align:start position:0%
taking my question um so I think I
 
05:24:51.750 --> 05:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying obviously
 
05:24:55.270 --> 05:24:55.280 align:start position:0%
you're one part is your you oplc is not
 
05:24:58.628 --> 05:24:58.638 align:start position:0%
taking a formal stand on this but this
 
05:25:01.510 --> 05:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
um telepass
 
05:25:06.190 --> 05:25:06.200 align:start position:0%
um it sounds like something that
 
05:25:11.628 --> 05:25:11.638 align:start position:0%
um might be too specific is that fair to
 
05:25:14.910 --> 05:25:14.920 align:start position:0%
say it seems like by naming it and
 
05:25:18.190 --> 05:25:18.200 align:start position:0%
calling it out as telepath and I assume
 
05:25:22.628 --> 05:25:22.638 align:start position:0%
it's not in any rsas at this point um
 
05:25:25.750 --> 05:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
that that type of Licensing process it
 
05:25:28.310 --> 05:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
sounds like it's something that's
 
05:25:31.628 --> 05:25:31.638 align:start position:0%
temporary or I don't know what the word
 
05:25:35.070 --> 05:25:35.080 align:start position:0%
would be but maybe just too specific
 
05:25:37.150 --> 05:25:37.160 align:start position:0%
does my question does that make sense my
 
05:25:40.788 --> 05:25:40.798 align:start position:0%
question make sense so I I think Dr
 
05:25:43.030 --> 05:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
Warner can probably testify to this um
 
05:25:45.990 --> 05:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
with more um eloquence than I can
 
05:25:48.310 --> 05:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
probably but my understanding it's not
 
05:25:52.990 --> 05:25:53.000 align:start position:0%
temporary um but it is intended to allow
 
05:25:54.830 --> 05:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
people to
 
05:25:58.350 --> 05:25:58.360 align:start position:0%
um you know if you're a psychologist in
 
05:26:00.788 --> 05:26:00.798 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and your patient comes up
 
05:26:04.030 --> 05:26:04.040 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire um and they need to do
 
05:26:06.150 --> 05:26:06.160 align:start position:0%
a session with you online you could use
 
05:26:08.270 --> 05:26:08.280 align:start position:0%
rather than getting a full New Hampshire
 
05:26:11.150 --> 05:26:11.160 align:start position:0%
license or going through this compact
 
05:26:12.628 --> 05:26:12.638 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if Massachusetts is a
 
05:26:14.390 --> 05:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
member of the compact they could more
 
05:26:18.350 --> 05:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
easily get this T telepass license and
 
05:26:21.750 --> 05:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
followup Madam chair followup and it is
 
05:26:23.750 --> 05:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
my understanding that the executive
 
05:26:26.430 --> 05:26:26.440 align:start position:0%
order that allows for various Health
 
05:26:29.948 --> 05:26:29.958 align:start position:0%
Care to occur via tele medicine already
 
05:26:32.868 --> 05:26:32.878 align:start position:0%
covers this at least
 
05:26:37.350 --> 05:26:37.360 align:start position:0%
temporarily um I I believe it does but
 
05:26:39.470 --> 05:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
the emergency order that would only be
 
05:26:41.150 --> 05:26:41.160 align:start position:0%
valid during the pendency of the
 
05:26:45.868 --> 05:26:45.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:49.628 --> 05:26:49.638 align:start position:0%
does other questions for Mr
 
05:26:53.390 --> 05:26:53.400 align:start position:0%
Brer in that case Dr Warner H yes thank
 
05:26:56.190 --> 05:26:56.200 align:start position:0%
you so much I I am sorry I had a
 
05:26:59.350 --> 05:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
technical issue uh just as you uh
 
05:27:01.270 --> 05:27:01.280 align:start position:0%
allowed my computer
 
05:27:06.708 --> 05:27:06.718 align:start position:0%
to um on so um I do have comments on
 
05:27:10.788 --> 05:27:10.798 align:start position:0%
this the yourself first can can you hear
 
05:27:13.110 --> 05:27:13.120 align:start position:0%

05:27:14.990 --> 05:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
please introduce yourself first before
 
05:27:17.230 --> 05:27:17.240 align:start position:0%
going into your testimony yes thank you
 
05:27:18.788 --> 05:27:18.798 align:start position:0%
so much I'm a little flustered because
 
05:27:21.548 --> 05:27:21.558 align:start position:0%
my whole computer just went oh went
 
05:27:26.070 --> 05:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
funny and I'm on my iPad now um I'm Dr
 
05:27:27.948 --> 05:27:27.958 align:start position:0%
Debbie Warner I'm in Littleton New
 
05:27:30.510 --> 05:27:30.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I serve on the board of Psy
 
05:27:33.230 --> 05:27:33.240 align:start position:0%
psychologists I'm the vice chair and I
 
05:27:35.788 --> 05:27:35.798 align:start position:0%
come here representing the board uh we
 
05:27:39.070 --> 05:27:39.080 align:start position:0%
did author this section of the bill the
 
05:27:44.110 --> 05:27:44.120 align:start position:0%
part Roman 12 and um we felt we had very
 
05:27:47.110 --> 05:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
good reason for that we appreciate
 
05:27:49.270 --> 05:27:49.280 align:start position:0%
Senator Reagan bringing this forward for
 
05:27:52.110 --> 05:27:52.120 align:start position:0%
us and uh just as he did previously
 
05:27:56.230 --> 05:27:56.240 align:start position:0%
bring forth cypa on our behalf I we are
 
05:27:56.240 --> 05:27:57.110 align:start position:0%
bring forth cypa on our behalf I we are
doing

05:27:57.110 --> 05:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
doing
 
05:28:00.628 --> 05:28:00.638 align:start position:0%
cack and as for compacts uh it is good
 
05:28:02.708 --> 05:28:02.718 align:start position:0%
to get in on the ground floor if we can
 
05:28:06.948 --> 05:28:06.958 align:start position:0%
send a rule nerd into the midst and I
 
05:28:09.390 --> 05:28:09.400 align:start position:0%
happen to be that little rule nerd as
 
05:28:13.708 --> 05:28:13.718 align:start position:0%
you are well aware um and so cypac is
 
05:28:16.510 --> 05:28:16.520 align:start position:0%
progressing and they are developing good
 
05:28:20.868 --> 05:28:20.878 align:start position:0%
rules we do have a little gap between
 
05:28:22.990 --> 05:28:23.000 align:start position:0%
what we're doing very well we like these
 
05:28:25.590 --> 05:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
emergency licenses actually uh they make
 
05:28:27.830 --> 05:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
it very easy for somebody to very
 
05:28:30.670 --> 05:28:30.680 align:start position:0%
quickly uh come in and follow their
 
05:28:33.150 --> 05:28:33.160 align:start position:0%
patients into New Hampshire whether or
 
05:28:35.390 --> 05:28:35.400 align:start position:0%
not they are uh students who've come
 
05:28:37.868 --> 05:28:37.878 align:start position:0%
home from school or visitors or
 
05:28:40.670 --> 05:28:40.680 align:start position:0%
snowbirds or U maybe visiting family who
 
05:28:42.350 --> 05:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
have come to New Hampshire to deal with
 
05:28:44.948 --> 05:28:44.958 align:start position:0%
a family crisis perhaps and they want to
 
05:28:47.548 --> 05:28:47.558 align:start position:0%
retain continuity with their care back
 
05:28:50.270 --> 05:28:50.280 align:start position:0%
home those are all very very good uses
 
05:28:53.708 --> 05:28:53.718 align:start position:0%
for this little telepath license which
 
05:28:57.430 --> 05:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
is basically almost the same format as
 
05:28:59.350 --> 05:28:59.360 align:start position:0%
our emergency licenses that are
 
05:29:00.868 --> 05:29:00.878 align:start position:0%
happening during Co
 
05:29:03.350 --> 05:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
which we like uh we were appreciative of
 
05:29:07.110 --> 05:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
how that went so swiftly now cypa itself
 
05:29:10.310 --> 05:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
is a big deal it takes about three or
 
05:29:13.030 --> 05:29:13.040 align:start position:0%
four months to get your credentials
 
05:29:16.670 --> 05:29:16.680 align:start position:0%
through cypa and it costs
 
05:29:20.030 --> 05:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
$440 and that's fine you're going to get
 
05:29:22.788 --> 05:29:22.798 align:start position:0%
a lot of states in that currently There
 
05:29:27.070 --> 05:29:27.080 align:start position:0%
are 16 States in our cact Compact and
 
05:29:29.150 --> 05:29:29.160 align:start position:0%
there so that least 34 states that are
 
05:29:33.628 --> 05:29:33.638 align:start position:0%
not and and uh this little telip pass
 
05:29:36.110 --> 05:29:36.120 align:start position:0%
would take care of that and that people
 
05:29:38.910 --> 05:29:38.920 align:start position:0%
who just want a little mini license and
 
05:29:41.910 --> 05:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
come in it is unlimited for the year in
 
05:29:44.430 --> 05:29:44.440 align:start position:0%
terms of the way we see it uh in terms
 
05:29:47.070 --> 05:29:47.080 align:start position:0%
of time and number of sessions but it is
 
05:29:50.230 --> 05:29:50.240 align:start position:0%
just teley medicine and it is meant for
 
05:29:53.150 --> 05:29:53.160 align:start position:0%
uh reaching into the state um by
 
05:29:55.270 --> 05:29:55.280 align:start position:0%
licensed doctors of
 
05:29:58.510 --> 05:29:58.520 align:start position:0%
psychology now um there are some
 
05:30:00.670 --> 05:30:00.680 align:start position:0%
questions that I heard previously do you
 
05:30:03.670 --> 05:30:03.680 align:start position:0%
know about um compliance and what
 
05:30:06.670 --> 05:30:06.680 align:start position:0%
quality of folks you're getting we are
 
05:30:08.030 --> 05:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
make making sure that it is at the
 
05:30:10.628 --> 05:30:10.638 align:start position:0%
doctoral level um that they come in and
 
05:30:11.990 --> 05:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
they have
 
05:30:15.510 --> 05:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
to a test that they have a clean license
 
05:30:18.030 --> 05:30:18.040 align:start position:0%
and no issues on their license and no
 
05:30:21.628 --> 05:30:21.638 align:start position:0%
discipline and that we can do this very
 
05:30:24.430 --> 05:30:24.440 align:start position:0%
quickly administratively and oplc is
 
05:30:27.948 --> 05:30:27.958 align:start position:0%
getting quite Dandy at the online
 
05:30:30.910 --> 05:30:30.920 align:start position:0%
licensing and renewals and things and so
 
05:30:32.510 --> 05:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
we're hoping that it would be
 
05:30:35.150 --> 05:30:35.160 align:start position:0%
instantaneous that if somebody you're
 
05:30:37.230 --> 05:30:37.240 align:start position:0%
following goes into the state that you
 
05:30:41.230 --> 05:30:41.240 align:start position:0%
can take care of them um for a low price
 
05:30:44.030 --> 05:30:44.040 align:start position:0%
it's not very difficult to evaluate
 
05:30:47.270 --> 05:30:47.280 align:start position:0%
these and if somebody happens to lie and
 
05:30:49.110 --> 05:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
say that they have a clean license but
 
05:30:51.548 --> 05:30:51.558 align:start position:0%
they don't they will be in such super
 
05:30:54.390 --> 05:30:54.400 align:start position:0%
trouble uh that it is really not worth
 
05:30:57.510 --> 05:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
lying um when we check it the next
 
05:30:59.470 --> 05:30:59.480 align:start position:0%
business day or two and find out if
 
05:31:01.548 --> 05:31:01.558 align:start position:0%
they're wrong they're going to get a
 
05:31:04.628 --> 05:31:04.638 align:start position:0%
very severe penalty in their home state
 
05:31:09.110 --> 05:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
for uh probably a revocation uh we would
 
05:31:11.310 --> 05:31:11.320 align:start position:0%
put in our rules that we would have to
 
05:31:12.910 --> 05:31:12.920 align:start position:0%
construct that you would be revoked if
 
05:31:16.190 --> 05:31:16.200 align:start position:0%
you lied on your application like that
 
05:31:20.190 --> 05:31:20.200 align:start position:0%
um we are hoping that this is uh easy to
 
05:31:22.070 --> 05:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
administer as we haven't heard any
 
05:31:24.708 --> 05:31:24.718 align:start position:0%
complaints from oplc about their
 
05:31:27.390 --> 05:31:27.400 align:start position:0%
administrating the emergency licenses
 
05:31:29.990 --> 05:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
and so we think it will be very Dandy in
 
05:31:33.030 --> 05:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
that that way we also um looking for a
 
05:31:38.110 --> 05:31:38.120 align:start position:0%
low price very quick and very uh very
 
05:31:40.430 --> 05:31:40.440 align:start position:0%
helpful this will only benefit the
 
05:31:42.350 --> 05:31:42.360 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire and the
 
05:31:44.830 --> 05:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
visitors who come here it doesn't it
 
05:31:46.390 --> 05:31:46.400 align:start position:0%
benefit the psychologists who are
 
05:31:47.788 --> 05:31:47.798 align:start position:0%
licensed in New Hampshire because
 
05:31:50.270 --> 05:31:50.280 align:start position:0%
actually it's going to increase the pool
 
05:31:53.470 --> 05:31:53.480 align:start position:0%
of talent available to draw upon but we
 
05:31:55.110 --> 05:31:55.120 align:start position:0%
do have a number of Specialties that
 
05:31:58.070 --> 05:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
we're a little sparse at and so it would
 
05:32:00.510 --> 05:32:00.520 align:start position:0%
be very nice to be able to draw on from
 
05:32:03.190 --> 05:32:03.200 align:start position:0%
other states and people could it might
 
05:32:04.948 --> 05:32:04.958 align:start position:0%
just be one of those New Hampshire
 
05:32:08.270 --> 05:32:08.280 align:start position:0%
advantages that we get to have um a
 
05:32:11.470 --> 05:32:11.480 align:start position:0%
broader uh spectrum of providers be able
 
05:32:13.670 --> 05:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
to help us here in New Hampshire so if
 
05:32:16.070 --> 05:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
you were going to for example get a
 
05:32:18.628 --> 05:32:18.638 align:start position:0%
specialty care out of New York or Boston
 
05:32:20.708 --> 05:32:20.718 align:start position:0%
or wherever it might be and you can
 
05:32:23.390 --> 05:32:23.400 align:start position:0%
entice them to pay that extra perhaps
 
05:32:26.470 --> 05:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
$100 and come and help you here uh with
 
05:32:29.150 --> 05:32:29.160 align:start position:0%
very little difficulty on their part I
 
05:32:31.030 --> 05:32:31.040 align:start position:0%
think that we would find that it's very
 
05:32:33.510 --> 05:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
very helpful to our people I've talked
 
05:32:37.150 --> 05:32:37.160 align:start position:0%
with the um board um administrators from
 
05:32:38.948 --> 05:32:38.958 align:start position:0%
some of the neighboring states and they
 
05:32:41.430 --> 05:32:41.440 align:start position:0%
want to see how this goes if we take it
 
05:32:43.868 --> 05:32:43.878 align:start position:0%
on maybe they will too and bring that
 
05:32:45.990 --> 05:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
forward and we can have just sort of a a
 
05:32:49.990 --> 05:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
nice neighborhood of um reciprocal care
 
05:32:51.910 --> 05:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
and we don't have any other real
 
05:32:54.110 --> 05:32:54.120 align:start position:0%
reciprocity with other states at this
 
05:32:56.948 --> 05:32:56.958 align:start position:0%
point in time now I can speak on this
 
05:32:59.030 --> 05:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
bill with the authority of the board of
 
05:33:02.470 --> 05:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
psychologists I am also as I indicated I
 
05:33:04.548 --> 05:33:04.558 align:start position:0%
am the commissioner uh from New
 
05:33:06.310 --> 05:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for
 
05:33:09.708 --> 05:33:09.718 align:start position:0%
cypa and um I can answer questions about
 
05:33:12.788 --> 05:33:12.798 align:start position:0%
cypac but I'm not their spokesperson per
 
05:33:15.670 --> 05:33:15.680 align:start position:0%
se I can just talk as your commissioner
 
05:33:18.830 --> 05:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
U and give you feedback uh those are my
 
05:33:21.910 --> 05:33:21.920 align:start position:0%
points and um be happy to take questions
 
05:33:24.788 --> 05:33:24.798 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you we will be having a
 
05:33:27.310 --> 05:33:27.320 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on this next Thursday and
 
05:33:31.708 --> 05:33:31.718 align:start position:0%

05:33:37.430 --> 05:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
there's the committee yes sub commmittee
 
05:33:40.270 --> 05:33:40.280 align:start position:0%
I that's a little tough for me but what
 
05:33:41.830 --> 05:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
time would that
 
05:33:45.830 --> 05:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
be uh afternoon I
 
05:33:48.430 --> 05:33:48.440 align:start position:0%
imagine okay I if I could get that
 
05:33:49.830 --> 05:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
information early that would be very
 
05:33:51.350 --> 05:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
helpful I'll put that make sure that I
 
05:33:55.430 --> 05:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
can do that okay I will the subcommittee
 
05:33:57.430 --> 05:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
chair will will let you know when he
 
05:34:00.190 --> 05:34:00.200 align:start position:0%
plans to take it up representative sh
 
05:34:02.030 --> 05:34:02.040 align:start position:0%
you have a
 
05:34:04.788 --> 05:34:04.798 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you madam chair um
 
05:34:06.310 --> 05:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question Dr
 
05:34:08.948 --> 05:34:08.958 align:start position:0%
Warner I'm I'm a little bit confused
 
05:34:08.958 --> 05:34:10.628 align:start position:0%
Warner I'm I'm a little bit confused
about

05:34:10.628 --> 05:34:10.638 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:34:13.948 --> 05:34:13.958 align:start position:0%
um at one point you said the cost for
 
05:34:18.430 --> 05:34:18.440 align:start position:0%
CPA was around uh I believe you said
 
05:34:21.270 --> 05:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
$440 towards the end of your testimony
 
05:34:24.070 --> 05:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
you said that there was or you alluded
 
05:34:26.270 --> 05:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
to it multiple parts of your testimony
 
05:34:28.270 --> 05:34:28.280 align:start position:0%
but I'm a little confused something that
 
05:34:32.390 --> 05:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
is smaller than that like a shortterm or
 
05:34:37.270 --> 05:34:37.280 align:start position:0%
specific by client type of
 
05:34:37.280 --> 05:34:38.830 align:start position:0%
specific by client type of
sidea

05:34:38.830 --> 05:34:38.840 align:start position:0%
sidea
 
05:34:42.190 --> 05:34:42.200 align:start position:0%
yes yes I should clarify cypa is
 
05:34:43.990 --> 05:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
different than this
 
05:34:46.948 --> 05:34:46.958 align:start position:0%
bill this bill is to bring forward our
 
05:34:50.788 --> 05:34:50.798 align:start position:0%
very own New Hampshire brand of Telly
 
05:34:54.190 --> 05:34:54.200 align:start position:0%
pass license which is only for telly
 
05:34:57.628 --> 05:34:57.638 align:start position:0%
medicine it's only for licensed
 
05:34:59.910 --> 05:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
psychologists at the doctoral level from
 
05:35:03.030 --> 05:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
other states and we take the money and
 
05:35:05.750 --> 05:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
we process it and one thing we do like
 
05:35:09.670 --> 05:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
about this is that they follow our rules
 
05:35:12.030 --> 05:35:12.040 align:start position:0%
our laws and they're administrated by
 
05:35:14.830 --> 05:35:14.840 align:start position:0%
our board we don't have to go through
 
05:35:18.548 --> 05:35:18.558 align:start position:0%
that other structure which is the cact
 
05:35:21.750 --> 05:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
commission and all of that um business
 
05:35:25.470 --> 05:35:25.480 align:start position:0%
at the the national uh Association level
 
05:35:29.070 --> 05:35:29.080 align:start position:0%
um so this fills in that Gap that takes
 
05:35:30.510 --> 05:35:30.520 align:start position:0%
so that we can
 
05:35:35.990 --> 05:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
and have access that's quick and proper
 
05:35:38.030 --> 05:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
and that we have jurisdiction good
 
05:35:41.990 --> 05:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over their practice um but
 
05:35:45.430 --> 05:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
it in terms of the provider the provider
 
05:35:47.628 --> 05:35:47.638 align:start position:0%
would like it probably because we will
 
05:35:51.788 --> 05:35:51.798 align:start position:0%
have a low price on this simple license
 
05:35:53.750 --> 05:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
as opposed to paying
 
05:35:58.270 --> 05:35:58.280 align:start position:0%
$440 to cact and you get 16 States for
 
05:36:00.350 --> 05:36:00.360 align:start position:0%
that but if your patient didn't go to
 
05:36:03.310 --> 05:36:03.320 align:start position:0%
that state what do you
 
05:36:06.270 --> 05:36:06.280 align:start position:0%
do so we're we're trying to fill a
 
05:36:08.230 --> 05:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
little niche there it's it's not in
 
05:36:10.150 --> 05:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
competition with sidea but it's just a
 
05:36:11.470 --> 05:36:11.480 align:start position:0%
niche in
 
05:36:13.430 --> 05:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
between and Madam chair I have a
 
05:36:16.110 --> 05:36:16.120 align:start position:0%
followup followup so you mentioned too
 
05:36:19.230 --> 05:36:19.240 align:start position:0%
that there were conditions that um the
 
05:36:19.240 --> 05:36:20.350 align:start position:0%
that there were conditions that um the
available

05:36:20.350 --> 05:36:20.360 align:start position:0%
available
 
05:36:23.750 --> 05:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
practitioners are um low in number and
 
05:36:26.590 --> 05:36:26.600 align:start position:0%
some cases maybe not in existence would
 
05:36:28.868 --> 05:36:28.878 align:start position:0%
you believe that I have one of those
 
05:36:30.430 --> 05:36:30.440 align:start position:0%
conditions and during the executive
 
05:36:33.190 --> 05:36:33.200 align:start position:0%
order that allowed for tele medicine I
 
05:36:36.310 --> 05:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
was able to reconnect with my therapist

members of the committee for the record
 
05:40:34.830 --> 05:40:34.840 align:start position:0%
Bob G Senate District 2 uh and Prime
 
05:40:39.190 --> 05:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
sponsor of part 13 of Senate Bill 133 FN
 
05:40:40.948 --> 05:40:40.958 align:start position:0%
as amended by the
 
05:40:44.948 --> 05:40:44.958 align:start position:0%
Senate uh this bill grew out of uh a
 
05:40:49.948 --> 05:40:49.958 align:start position:0%
rule passed by uh the um Food Services
 
05:40:52.430 --> 05:40:52.440 align:start position:0%
Division of Public Health uh well
 
05:40:55.670 --> 05:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
intended by adopting a federal standard
 
05:40:57.628 --> 05:40:57.638 align:start position:0%
that would require a certified food
 
05:41:00.230 --> 05:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
protection manager to be on
 
05:41:02.390 --> 05:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
during working hours for any food
 
05:41:04.468 --> 05:41:04.478 align:start position:0%
facility at all in the
 
05:41:08.190 --> 05:41:08.200 align:start position:0%
State uh obviously uh in the interest of
 
05:41:11.070 --> 05:41:11.080 align:start position:0%
safety I can understand and respect uh
 
05:41:14.110 --> 05:41:14.120 align:start position:0%
that been a very low incidence of food
 
05:41:17.110 --> 05:41:17.120 align:start position:0%
poisoning incidents uh as demonstrated
 
05:41:19.868 --> 05:41:19.878 align:start position:0%
by their own data uh but the concern
 
05:41:22.310 --> 05:41:22.320 align:start position:0%
here is that there are a number of small
 
05:41:25.350 --> 05:41:25.360 align:start position:0%
food establishments and that the $300
 
05:41:29.230 --> 05:41:29.240 align:start position:0%
fee for becoming certified uh by a
 
05:41:32.390 --> 05:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
private agency recognized by the state
 
05:41:34.868 --> 05:41:34.878 align:start position:0%
uh becomes onerous when one considers
 
05:41:37.590 --> 05:41:37.600 align:start position:0%
the turnover in employees which is high
 
05:41:40.030 --> 05:41:40.040 align:start position:0%
in the food service industry uh and
 
05:41:43.310 --> 05:41:43.320 align:start position:0%
thereby bringing very significant
 
05:41:45.350 --> 05:41:45.360 align:start position:0%
additional costs as a requirement to
 
05:41:47.830 --> 05:41:47.840 align:start position:0%
even open your doors and so what this
 
05:41:51.468 --> 05:41:51.478 align:start position:0%
bill does uh it it it exempts small
 
05:41:54.190 --> 05:41:54.200 align:start position:0%
establishments um the restaurant uh and
 
05:41:56.468 --> 05:41:56.478 align:start position:0%
and hotel uh organization is supporting
 
05:41:59.788 --> 05:41:59.798 align:start position:0%
this HHS worked with us to develop this
 
05:42:02.830 --> 05:42:02.840 align:start position:0%
um it takes uh it still makes the
 
05:42:05.230 --> 05:42:05.240 align:start position:0%
establishments responsible makes them
 
05:42:07.628 --> 05:42:07.638 align:start position:0%
have a person in charge that's a
 
05:42:10.590 --> 05:42:10.600 align:start position:0%
certified food safety manager um still
 
05:42:12.350 --> 05:42:12.360 align:start position:0%
has the responsibilties and obligation
 
05:42:14.430 --> 05:42:14.440 align:start position:0%
exempt certain types of food preparation
 
05:42:15.510 --> 05:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
such as
 
05:42:18.230 --> 05:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
reheating uh and at the same time
 
05:42:21.390 --> 05:42:21.400 align:start position:0%
mitigates the uh the significant expense
 
05:42:23.750 --> 05:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
with the high turnover of $300 per
 
05:42:26.310 --> 05:42:26.320 align:start position:0%
certification employees uh that just
 
05:42:29.190 --> 05:42:29.200 align:start position:0%
under the uh rulemaking that uh to their
 
05:42:33.670 --> 05:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
credit uh they have not um vigorously
 
05:42:37.270 --> 05:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
enforced uh due due to the pandemic uh
 
05:42:39.750 --> 05:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
and also due to their understanding of
 
05:42:42.430 --> 05:42:42.440 align:start position:0%
uh the fact that uh this is onerous on
 
05:42:44.548 --> 05:42:44.558 align:start position:0%
the small businesses I'm happy to
 
05:42:46.910 --> 05:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
address section by section uh but it's
 
05:42:48.948 --> 05:42:48.958 align:start position:0%
pretty pretty clear there is currently
 
05:42:52.390 --> 05:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
only one section that's a11 under 143
 
05:42:53.670 --> 05:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
this would add
 
05:42:56.150 --> 05:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
A1A um a certified food protection
 
05:42:58.468 --> 05:42:58.478 align:start position:0%
manager section and with that Madam
 
05:43:00.990 --> 05:43:01.000 align:start position:0%
chair I will take any questions thank
 
05:43:03.468 --> 05:43:03.478 align:start position:0%
you Senator are there
 
05:43:06.230 --> 05:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
05:43:09.788 --> 05:43:09.798 align:start position:0%
scitec Senator G you said uh reheating
 
05:43:09.798 --> 05:43:12.270 align:start position:0%
scitec Senator G you said uh reheating
is

05:43:12.270 --> 05:43:12.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:14.390 --> 05:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
Exempted I'm sorry I I can't hear you
 
05:43:17.750 --> 05:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
sir I'm sorry uh reheating is Exempted
 
05:43:19.350 --> 05:43:19.360 align:start position:0%
does that mean McDonald's is off the
 
05:43:21.150 --> 05:43:21.160 align:start position:0%
hook on
 
05:43:23.628 --> 05:43:23.638 align:start position:0%
this let me read the exact language if
 
05:43:28.030 --> 05:43:28.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:28.040 --> 05:43:30.230 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:43:30.230 --> 05:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:43:32.990 --> 05:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
well where let me tell you where 14 let
 
05:43:34.910 --> 05:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
me tell you where I'm going does this
 
05:43:37.390 --> 05:43:37.400 align:start position:0%
mean if I go into today into the Common
 
05:43:40.030 --> 05:43:40.040 align:start position:0%
Man or McDonald's if it's not reheating
 
05:43:44.628 --> 05:43:44.638 align:start position:0%
they have a certified food uh uh prot
 
05:43:48.030 --> 05:43:48.040 align:start position:0%
protection manager on somebody certified
 
05:43:50.510 --> 05:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
standing there while that's correct they
 
05:43:52.468 --> 05:43:52.478 align:start position:0%
they either do or will shortly be
 
05:43:54.310 --> 05:43:54.320 align:start position:0%
required to I think that's more up to
 
05:43:57.910 --> 05:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
the uh to the call of HHS uh as I said
 
05:43:59.910 --> 05:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
they've been lenient in the of this
 
05:44:02.110 --> 05:44:02.120 align:start position:0%
understanding the pandemic and you know
 
05:44:03.468 --> 05:44:03.478 align:start position:0%
the slam that small businesses
 
05:44:04.830 --> 05:44:04.840 align:start position:0%
especially small eing establishments
 
05:44:06.350 --> 05:44:06.360 align:start position:0%
have taken but this will be a
 
05:44:08.590 --> 05:44:08.600 align:start position:0%
requirement that uh um you know the
 
05:44:10.868 --> 05:44:10.878 align:start position:0%
larger establishments that have you know
 
05:44:13.070 --> 05:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
uh five or 10 cook staff and then 20 or
 
05:44:15.310 --> 05:44:15.320 align:start position:0%
30 weight staff won't have a problem
 
05:44:16.788 --> 05:44:16.798 align:start position:0%
with this uh but the smaller
 
05:44:19.830 --> 05:44:19.840 align:start position:0%
establishments with with fewer people uh
 
05:44:21.948 --> 05:44:21.958 align:start position:0%
with a high turnover rate it becomes a
 
05:44:23.750 --> 05:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
significant cost to them and that's the
 
05:44:25.788 --> 05:44:25.798 align:start position:0%
reason for this legislation if you say
 
05:44:25.798 --> 05:44:27.708 align:start position:0%
reason for this legislation if you say
so

05:44:27.708 --> 05:44:27.718 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:44:31.030 --> 05:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative
 
05:44:33.830 --> 05:44:33.840 align:start position:0%

stores open and operating right now in
 
05:47:23.548 --> 05:47:23.558 align:start position:0%
five states on the East Coast 37 of
 
05:47:27.788 --> 05:47:27.798 align:start position:0%
those stores are in New Hampshire um so
 
05:47:29.510 --> 05:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
right now the state represents about
 
05:47:33.310 --> 05:47:33.320 align:start position:0%
half of our um brand as far as open and
 
05:47:36.430 --> 05:47:36.440 align:start position:0%
operating and we currently have just
 
05:47:40.310 --> 05:47:40.320 align:start position:0%
myself and my brother um upwards of 270
 
05:47:42.548 --> 05:47:42.558 align:start position:0%
employees in New Hampshire if you take
 
05:47:45.350 --> 05:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
into um if you take into account those
 
05:47:48.110 --> 05:47:48.120 align:start position:0%
are only 13 of the 37 we have well north
 
05:47:48.120 --> 05:47:48.910 align:start position:0%
are only 13 of the 37 we have well north
of

05:47:48.910 --> 05:47:48.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:47:52.510 --> 05:47:52.520 align:start position:0%
550 employees right now in the state um
 
05:47:54.948 --> 05:47:54.958 align:start position:0%
with eight additional stores in
 
05:47:57.910 --> 05:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
development um in New Hampshire alone
 
05:48:01.990 --> 05:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
over the next 18 to 24 months um I want
 
05:48:04.590 --> 05:48:04.600 align:start position:0%
everyone to understand that um our
 
05:48:09.070 --> 05:48:09.080 align:start position:0%
Workforce is made up um mostly
 
05:48:14.070 --> 05:48:14.080 align:start position:0%
of young high school and college um kids
 
05:48:16.708 --> 05:48:16.718 align:start position:0%
this is their first job that they
 
05:48:19.590 --> 05:48:19.600 align:start position:0%
receive um in some cases we are teaching
 
05:48:23.230 --> 05:48:23.240 align:start position:0%
them how to mop um how to wash dishes
 
05:48:26.270 --> 05:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
for the first time it is it is
 
05:48:30.350 --> 05:48:30.360 align:start position:0%
incredibly uh burdensome to ask them now
 
05:48:33.670 --> 05:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
to take a food manager level
 
05:48:37.030 --> 05:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
certification there is no need for these
 
05:48:39.468 --> 05:48:39.478 align:start position:0%
um young kids who who we work around
 
05:48:41.548 --> 05:48:41.558 align:start position:0%
their school schedules we work around
 
05:48:44.910 --> 05:48:44.920 align:start position:0%
their school sports schedules all their
 
05:48:47.110 --> 05:48:47.120 align:start position:0%
uh extracurricular activity we we are
 
05:48:50.110 --> 05:48:50.120 align:start position:0%
really looking to build
 
05:48:55.310 --> 05:48:55.320 align:start position:0%
um solid Workforce kids like entering
 
05:48:57.670 --> 05:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
entering into the the workforce in in
 
05:48:58.868 --> 05:48:58.878 align:start position:0%
the in New Hampshire in their
 
05:49:01.628 --> 05:49:01.638 align:start position:0%
surrounding states um asking them to
 
05:49:04.830 --> 05:49:04.840 align:start position:0%
learn what the correct temperature is to
 
05:49:07.788 --> 05:49:07.798 align:start position:0%
store or serve shellfish or chicken or
 
05:49:11.430 --> 05:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
how to refuse uh damaged cardboard all
 
05:49:13.628 --> 05:49:13.638 align:start position:0%
of which does not fit our business model
 
05:49:16.788 --> 05:49:16.798 align:start position:0%
whatsoever I have provided written
 
05:49:19.430 --> 05:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
testimony um to the senate committee
 
05:49:21.430 --> 05:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
that did pass and support this bill and
 
05:49:23.830 --> 05:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to share that information
 
05:49:25.750 --> 05:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
with the house and this particular
 
05:49:27.990 --> 05:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
committee to understand the financial
 
05:49:30.628 --> 05:49:30.638 align:start position:0%
burden on this this course is incredibly
 
05:49:34.030 --> 05:49:34.040 align:start position:0%
difficult to pass the first time it does
 
05:49:35.868 --> 05:49:35.878 align:start position:0%
they don't charge as much to try to
 
05:49:37.990 --> 05:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
attempt to pass the second time but in
 
05:49:41.590 --> 05:49:41.600 align:start position:0%
our experience only a 40% um passing
 
05:49:44.110 --> 05:49:44.120 align:start position:0%
rate happens the first time uh and
 
05:49:46.230 --> 05:49:46.240 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I just found out today
 
05:49:48.468 --> 05:49:48.478 align:start position:0%
that uh Serve Safe increased their cost
 
05:49:51.750 --> 05:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
for this Co um course by 8% so all my
 
05:49:54.030 --> 05:49:54.040 align:start position:0%
numbers that I've previously submitted
 
05:49:57.430 --> 05:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
to Senator GAA and his team um are
 
05:50:00.708 --> 05:50:00.718 align:start position:0%
already 8% too low just just for the 13
 
05:50:03.628 --> 05:50:03.638 align:start position:0%
stores that I operate this would this
 
05:50:06.990 --> 05:50:07.000 align:start position:0%
results in about an $80,000 a year uh
 
05:50:09.310 --> 05:50:09.320 align:start position:0%
cost to me and once these kids have it
 
05:50:10.948 --> 05:50:10.958 align:start position:0%
they can carry that on with them and
 
05:50:13.750 --> 05:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
take them to other places or other
 
05:50:17.788 --> 05:50:17.798 align:start position:0%
establishments um and I want we do not s
 
05:50:21.868 --> 05:50:21.878 align:start position:0%
we do not serve food from a raw State um
 
05:50:24.390 --> 05:50:24.400 align:start position:0%
all of it is thaw and serve or all of it
 
05:50:27.990 --> 05:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
is heat uh reheated in store we're we're
 
05:50:32.030 --> 05:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
not hand handling um raw products to the
 
05:50:34.270 --> 05:50:34.280 align:start position:0%
consumer and it's one thing when you're
 
05:50:34.280 --> 05:50:35.510 align:start position:0%
consumer and it's one thing when you're
serving

05:50:35.510 --> 05:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
serving
 
05:50:39.628 --> 05:50:39.638 align:start position:0%
three4 cups of coffee or energy drinks
 
05:50:43.110 --> 05:50:43.120 align:start position:0%
in a dut it's that's much different than
 
05:50:47.510 --> 05:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
serving 24 $30 plates of of seafood or
 
05:50:51.350 --> 05:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
chicken or steak so I I believe the
 
05:50:55.430 --> 05:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
intent was good I I I mirror um Senator
 
05:51:00.030 --> 05:51:00.040 align:start position:0%
gaa's um uh sentiment that um HHS has
 
05:51:03.670 --> 05:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
worked with us and and and changed the
 
05:51:06.190 --> 05:51:06.200 align:start position:0%
verbiage to to fit businesses like
 
05:51:09.030 --> 05:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
myself that we are requiring food
 
05:51:12.390 --> 05:51:12.400 align:start position:0%
handler certifications from our staff um
 
05:51:15.110 --> 05:51:15.120 align:start position:0%
which is which is plenty we still have
 
05:51:18.510 --> 05:51:18.520 align:start position:0%
food manager certification people on
 
05:51:20.350 --> 05:51:20.360 align:start position:0%
staff at each store they are available
 
05:51:22.070 --> 05:51:22.080 align:start position:0%
for all the hours that we're open but
 
05:51:25.350 --> 05:51:25.360 align:start position:0%
they're not there physically on site and
 
05:51:27.830 --> 05:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
and I think if everyone would read um
 
05:51:32.190 --> 05:51:32.200 align:start position:0%
the language in this part 13 um they'll
 
05:51:34.150 --> 05:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
understand that that this is a great
 
05:51:36.948 --> 05:51:36.958 align:start position:0%
compromise and it uh it actually serves
 
05:51:41.468 --> 05:51:41.478 align:start position:0%
out the intent of when HHS adopted the
 
05:51:44.590 --> 05:51:44.600 align:start position:0%
2017 FDA Food Code standards rule I
 
05:51:47.548 --> 05:51:47.558 align:start position:0%
think we've we've done a great job here
 
05:51:51.270 --> 05:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
getting um the intent um implemented and
 
05:51:53.310 --> 05:51:53.320 align:start position:0%
again I want to thank any thank everyone
 
05:51:54.868 --> 05:51:54.878 align:start position:0%
for their time and I'm here to answer
 
05:51:57.070 --> 05:51:57.080 align:start position:0%
any questions if there are
 
05:52:01.350 --> 05:52:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:05.628 --> 05:52:05.638 align:start position:0%
questions Mr San U one of my students

05:52:13.070 --> 05:52:13.080 align:start position:0%
hurting her
 
05:52:16.948 --> 05:52:16.958 align:start position:0%

kids and I'd be more than happy to
 
05:52:26.548 --> 05:52:26.558 align:start position:0%
employ some more of
 
05:52:29.070 --> 05:52:29.080 align:start position:0%
them representative
 
05:52:32.230 --> 05:52:32.240 align:start position:0%
fellows um yes I would thank you madam
 
05:52:35.948 --> 05:52:35.958 align:start position:0%
chair I would just um like to ask the
 
05:52:39.510 --> 05:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
person testifying um if he could repeat
 
05:52:43.270 --> 05:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
what the license that um or certificate
 
05:52:47.910 --> 05:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
they already have is food handlers is
 
05:52:50.830 --> 05:52:50.840 align:start position:0%
that that that's that's correct uh
 
05:52:53.468 --> 05:52:53.478 align:start position:0%
representative fellows what we did so
 
05:52:55.468 --> 05:52:55.478 align:start position:0%
that everyone understands pre we were
 
05:52:58.990 --> 05:52:59.000 align:start position:0%
dealing with this issue preco um in that
 
05:53:02.430 --> 05:53:02.440 align:start position:0%
in those discussions um we were HHS
 
05:53:05.190 --> 05:53:05.200 align:start position:0%
allowed us to apply for and we received
 
05:53:07.750 --> 05:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
a variance waiver for this particular
 
05:53:10.390 --> 05:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
rule so there are some cities that we
 
05:53:12.510 --> 05:53:12.520 align:start position:0%
operate in that that self-inspect and
 
05:53:14.270 --> 05:53:14.280 align:start position:0%
there are other cities in towns and
 
05:53:16.430 --> 05:53:16.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities in the state that have
 
05:53:18.990 --> 05:53:19.000 align:start position:0%
that rely on state inspectors well we
 
05:53:21.830 --> 05:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
applied for and received a waiver
 
05:53:24.628 --> 05:53:24.638 align:start position:0%
variant part of our waiver variance
 
05:53:26.788 --> 05:53:26.798 align:start position:0%
representative is that we because we are
 
05:53:29.190 --> 05:53:29.200 align:start position:0%
a growing brand and because we have 75
 
05:53:31.430 --> 05:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
stores we do self monthly self
 
05:53:34.230 --> 05:53:34.240 align:start position:0%
inspections of all of our stores we make
 
05:53:36.468 --> 05:53:36.478 align:start position:0%
sure that they are clean we make sure
 
05:53:37.990 --> 05:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
that all the equipment's operating
 
05:53:39.230 --> 05:53:39.240 align:start position:0%
properly we make sure that the
 
05:53:41.230 --> 05:53:41.240 align:start position:0%
temperatures are correct we make sure of
 
05:53:42.990 --> 05:53:43.000 align:start position:0%
all those things and we provided all
 
05:53:46.628 --> 05:53:46.638 align:start position:0%
that information to HHS and in addition
 
05:53:49.990 --> 05:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
to that we are requiring all of our
 
05:53:52.110 --> 05:53:52.120 align:start position:0%
employees as part of their onboarding
 
05:53:55.628 --> 05:53:55.638 align:start position:0%
training to take a ServSafe food handler
 
05:53:58.670 --> 05:53:58.680 align:start position:0%
certificate it's a $15 course
 
05:54:03.270 --> 05:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
it's much much um more geared toward
 
05:54:05.750 --> 05:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
what these kids will be dealing with
 
05:54:07.990 --> 05:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
temperature safety
 
05:54:11.830 --> 05:54:11.840 align:start position:0%
hygiene um allergens it's it it's the
 
05:54:14.468 --> 05:54:14.478 align:start position:0%
meat and potatoes of working in the food
 
05:54:17.468 --> 05:54:17.478 align:start position:0%
service industry it's not the technical
 
05:54:21.468 --> 05:54:21.478 align:start position:0%
long drawn out six-hour course it's a
 
05:54:25.628 --> 05:54:25.638 align:start position:0%
two-hour course that much more um aligns
 
05:54:28.350 --> 05:54:28.360 align:start position:0%
with the business model that we run and
 
05:54:32.390 --> 05:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
that one is is is very um informative
 
05:54:34.830 --> 05:54:34.840 align:start position:0%
much easier to pass and much more
 
05:54:37.430 --> 05:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
affordable in what I feel suits our our
 
05:54:39.910 --> 05:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
business model much
 
05:54:44.430 --> 05:54:44.440 align:start position:0%
better um followup followup uh thank you
 
05:54:48.150 --> 05:54:48.160 align:start position:0%
so this this certificate that that all
 
05:54:51.670 --> 05:54:51.680 align:start position:0%
that your employees are getting is that
 
05:54:54.270 --> 05:54:54.280 align:start position:0%
that doesn't fall under the state lure
 
05:54:57.150 --> 05:54:57.160 align:start position:0%
is that correct is that from my
 
05:54:58.788 --> 05:54:58.798 align:start position:0%
independent source
 
05:55:00.628 --> 05:55:00.638 align:start position:0%
and there's no State requirement for
 
05:55:02.548 --> 05:55:02.558 align:start position:0%
that or not is that not
 
05:55:05.310 --> 05:55:05.320 align:start position:0%
correct it it is my understanding right
 
05:55:07.510 --> 05:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
now that that is not a state requirement
 
05:55:09.788 --> 05:55:09.798 align:start position:0%
it is one thing that we're doing to go
 
05:55:12.990 --> 05:55:13.000 align:start position:0%
above and beyond the requirement to
 
05:55:15.390 --> 05:55:15.400 align:start position:0%
prove that we understand the attent of
 
05:55:17.830 --> 05:55:17.840 align:start position:0%
adopting this rule but we have a better
 
05:55:20.110 --> 05:55:20.120 align:start position:0%
way and a more structured and it fits
 
05:55:22.030 --> 05:55:22.040 align:start position:0%
our business model better but the food
 
05:55:25.230 --> 05:55:25.240 align:start position:0%
handler certificate in in my experience
 
05:55:29.910 --> 05:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
is not required at any state level
 
05:55:29.920 --> 05:55:30.868 align:start position:0%
is not required at any state level
thank

05:55:30.868 --> 05:55:30.878 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:55:34.750 --> 05:55:34.760 align:start position:0%
you other representative schs mam chair
 
05:55:36.628 --> 05:55:36.638 align:start position:0%
my question is actually for you one of
 
05:55:40.788 --> 05:55:40.798 align:start position:0%
my classic dumb questions um and I do
 
05:55:43.670 --> 05:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
appreciate uh Mr San's testimony my
 
05:55:46.910 --> 05:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
question is is it safe to say that this
 
05:55:49.310 --> 05:55:49.320 align:start position:0%
topic is probably very well understood
 
05:55:50.990 --> 05:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
in one of the other committees like
 
05:55:52.230 --> 05:55:52.240 align:start position:0%
Commerce or
 
05:55:56.910 --> 05:55:56.920 align:start position:0%
HHS especially if these requirements are
 
05:56:02.030 --> 05:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
new uh it's possible but uh it's it's
 
05:56:02.040 --> 05:56:03.110 align:start position:0%
new uh it's possible but uh it's it's
close

05:56:03.110 --> 05:56:03.120 align:start position:0%
close
 
05:56:05.510 --> 05:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
enough okay I just feel like the
 
05:56:08.708 --> 05:56:08.718 align:start position:0%
expertise on this topic is probably I
 
05:56:11.548 --> 05:56:11.558 align:start position:0%
mean some of us have it personally but
 
05:56:13.628 --> 05:56:13.638 align:start position:0%
you know if they if these requirements
 
05:56:15.670 --> 05:56:15.680 align:start position:0%
are fairly new and the implementation
 
05:56:18.390 --> 05:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
around those requirements were already
 
05:56:20.868 --> 05:56:20.878 align:start position:0%
underway with another committee I just
 
05:56:24.430 --> 05:56:24.440 align:start position:0%
think it would be helpful to hear from
 
05:56:26.830 --> 05:56:26.840 align:start position:0%
someone from that committee I would
 
05:56:29.310 --> 05:56:29.320 align:start position:0%
suggest think think that the Committee
 
05:56:30.750 --> 05:56:30.760 align:start position:0%
involved would be
 
05:56:34.468 --> 05:56:34.478 align:start position:0%
HHS they have already committed to
 
05:56:37.110 --> 05:56:37.120 align:start position:0%
contacting them about section8 so I will
 
05:56:40.548 --> 05:56:40.558 align:start position:0%
mention this one as well thank
 
05:56:44.150 --> 05:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
you and the next there are no more
 
05:56:46.788 --> 05:56:46.798 align:start position:0%
questions from Mr San I'd like to call
 
05:56:49.708 --> 05:56:49.718 align:start position:0%

and Human Services Division of Public
 
05:57:03.830 --> 05:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
Health Services I want to thank the
 
05:57:05.868 --> 05:57:05.878 align:start position:0%
community for committee for the
 
05:57:07.468 --> 05:57:07.478 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak in support of
 
05:57:11.270 --> 05:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
section 13 of Senate Bill 133 regarding
 
05:57:14.030 --> 05:57:14.040 align:start position:0%
the program rules within DHHS for the
 
05:57:16.190 --> 05:57:16.200 align:start position:0%
sanitary production and distribution of
 
05:57:18.788 --> 05:57:18.798 align:start position:0%
food the department has worked closely
 
05:57:21.390 --> 05:57:21.400 align:start position:0%
with Senator GAA on this bill as amended
 
05:57:22.868 --> 05:57:22.878 align:start position:0%
to address concerns with the
 
05:57:25.190 --> 05:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
Department's food protection regulations
 
05:57:26.750 --> 05:57:26.760 align:start position:0%
in particular the certified food
 
05:57:28.750 --> 05:57:28.760 align:start position:0%
protection manager requirement this
 
05:57:31.548 --> 05:57:31.558 align:start position:0%
became a requirement when we uh updated
 
05:57:34.590 --> 05:57:34.600 align:start position:0%
our program rules to incorporate the
 
05:57:37.468 --> 05:57:37.478 align:start position:0%
latest version of the US uh US Food and
 
05:57:40.670 --> 05:57:40.680 align:start position:0%
Drug administration's F 2017 food code
 
05:57:42.670 --> 05:57:42.680 align:start position:0%
in August of
 
05:57:45.350 --> 05:57:45.360 align:start position:0%
2019 this bill as amended addresses the
 
05:57:48.310 --> 05:57:48.320 align:start position:0%
concern of hardship to small businesses
 
05:57:51.868 --> 05:57:51.878 align:start position:0%
while we uh feel that there is a very
 
05:57:53.830 --> 05:57:53.840 align:start position:0%
import there is importance to having
 
05:57:56.468 --> 05:57:56.478 align:start position:0%
that certified food protection manager
 
05:57:59.670 --> 05:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
on staff we feel that we have crafted a
 
05:58:02.070 --> 05:58:02.080 align:start position:0%
bill that provi allows flexibility for
 
05:58:05.110 --> 05:58:05.120 align:start position:0%
certain low-risk businesses when food
 
05:58:07.190 --> 05:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
preparation is limited to reheating
 
05:58:09.390 --> 05:58:09.400 align:start position:0%
commercially prepared food handling
 
05:58:11.910 --> 05:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
ready to eat food only or when this food
 
05:58:14.910 --> 05:58:14.920 align:start position:0%
establishment has five food employees or
 
05:58:17.430 --> 05:58:17.440 align:start position:0%
less on duty as long as there's already
 
05:58:20.030 --> 05:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
one certified food protection manager on
 
05:58:22.390 --> 05:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
staff I I also want to note the the
 
05:58:24.110 --> 05:58:24.120 align:start position:0%
department has also started a rule
 
05:58:26.548 --> 05:58:26.558 align:start position:0%
making process to amend our
 
05:58:28.350 --> 05:58:28.360 align:start position:0%
administrative rules to line with the
 
05:58:31.350 --> 05:58:31.360 align:start position:0%
changes proposed in SB 133 and we're
 
05:58:34.390 --> 05:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
hoping that those rules will go before
 
05:58:35.830 --> 05:58:35.840 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire joint legislative
 
05:58:37.628 --> 05:58:37.638 align:start position:0%
committee on administrative rules within
 
05:58:39.948 --> 05:58:39.958 align:start position:0%
the next few months uh thank you again
 
05:58:42.150 --> 05:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
for allowing me to speak to this bill
 
05:58:43.948 --> 05:58:43.958 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to take any questions that
 
05:58:47.110 --> 05:58:47.120 align:start position:0%
you may have uh I have a question how
 
05:58:48.830 --> 05:58:48.840 align:start position:0%
can you revise the rules if you don't
 
05:58:52.788 --> 05:58:52.798 align:start position:0%
have the statutory Authority so we uh we
 
05:58:56.750 --> 05:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
had um believe that we did have within
 
05:58:58.830 --> 05:58:58.840 align:start position:0%
our rules we had already had some
 
05:59:00.390 --> 05:59:00.400 align:start position:0%
exemptions to the certified food
 
05:59:03.670 --> 05:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
protection manager requirement so um
 
05:59:06.750 --> 05:59:06.760 align:start position:0%
along with the with this legislation we
 
05:59:09.070 --> 05:59:09.080 align:start position:0%
had concurrently started to update our
 
05:59:12.548 --> 05:59:12.558 align:start position:0%
rules um we haven't we just um submitted
 
05:59:14.628 --> 05:59:14.638 align:start position:0%
that fiscal impact statement we haven't
 
05:59:16.628 --> 05:59:16.638 align:start position:0%
had the public hearing but we had we had
 
05:59:19.990 --> 05:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
worked um both path past knowing this
 
05:59:22.868 --> 05:59:22.878 align:start position:0%
legislation was in progress um and we
 
05:59:26.590 --> 05:59:26.600 align:start position:0%
had um worked with Senator GAA and had
 
05:59:30.990 --> 05:59:31.000 align:start position:0%
spoke with him about doing Ru making as
 
05:59:34.948 --> 05:59:34.958 align:start position:0%
well I see uh representative Schmidt you
 
05:59:37.708 --> 05:59:37.718 align:start position:0%
have a question I do indeed thank you
 
05:59:43.150 --> 05:59:43.160 align:start position:0%
madam chair so miss uh Smith I believe
 
05:59:45.670 --> 05:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
Colleen I'll call you so
 
05:59:50.548 --> 05:59:50.558 align:start position:0%
uh certified Foods uh protection on
 
05:59:53.868 --> 05:59:53.878 align:start position:0%
staff I believe you said uh AR Roman
 
05:59:56.230 --> 05:59:56.240 align:start position:0%
Joe's the example we were just dealing
 
05:59:58.350 --> 05:59:58.360 align:start position:0%
with uh doesn't sound really like a
 
06:00:02.030 --> 06:00:02.040 align:start position:0%
small business if they have a hundred or
 
06:00:04.708 --> 06:00:04.718 align:start position:0%
so establishments all over the place but
 
06:00:06.830 --> 06:00:06.840 align:start position:0%
they're individually small I understand
 
06:00:10.788 --> 06:00:10.798 align:start position:0%
that uh how would this food service
 
06:00:14.350 --> 06:00:14.360 align:start position:0%
protection uh train Serv I've got the
 
06:00:15.948 --> 06:00:15.958 align:start position:0%
title wrong but you know what I'm
 
06:00:18.868 --> 06:00:18.878 align:start position:0%
talking about uh how is this person
 
06:00:21.830 --> 06:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
going to be able
 
06:00:26.070 --> 06:00:26.080 align:start position:0%
to um to to take care of that
 
06:00:29.190 --> 06:00:29.200 align:start position:0%
responsibility with hundreds of small
 
06:00:31.310 --> 06:00:31.320 align:start position:0%
establishments they're they're tiny
 
06:00:33.590 --> 06:00:33.600 align:start position:0%
we've got several here in
 
06:00:38.510 --> 06:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
do uh yes so and Mr senen if if um he
 
06:00:40.868 --> 06:00:40.878 align:start position:0%
would like to also CH chime in with
 
06:00:44.190 --> 06:00:44.200 align:start position:0%
regard to this you um they do have a
 
06:00:46.270 --> 06:00:46.280 align:start position:0%
certified food protection manager on
 
06:00:50.548 --> 06:00:50.558 align:start position:0%
staff already um as as he had explained
 
06:00:53.350 --> 06:00:53.360 align:start position:0%
um this will help his model um you know
 
06:00:55.390 --> 06:00:55.400 align:start position:0%
certainly those those later hours maybe
 
06:00:57.868 --> 06:00:57.878 align:start position:0%
that 5 to9 shift when that certified
 
06:00:59.590 --> 06:00:59.600 align:start position:0%
food protection manager wouldn't be
 
06:01:02.830 --> 06:01:02.840 align:start position:0%
present on um at the store but certainly
 
06:01:05.830 --> 06:01:05.840 align:start position:0%
available by phone if if there was a
 
06:01:09.750 --> 06:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
situation that that they were needed
 
06:01:13.310 --> 06:01:13.320 align:start position:0%
followup followup I I I understand that
 
06:01:16.150 --> 06:01:16.160 align:start position:0%
that that uh that they would have such a
 
06:01:20.150 --> 06:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
person on staff but the question is uh
 
06:01:23.310 --> 06:01:23.320 align:start position:0%
this person H how would the protection
 
06:01:27.910 --> 06:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
aspect work with uh dozens and in in the
 
06:01:30.708 --> 06:01:30.718 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire Alone
 
06:01:35.110 --> 06:01:35.120 align:start position:0%
um uh how would this person be able to
 
06:01:38.548 --> 06:01:38.558 align:start position:0%
oversee conditions in the individual
 
06:01:43.390 --> 06:01:43.400 align:start position:0%
shops so having that that individual on
 
06:01:46.708 --> 06:01:46.718 align:start position:0%
staff the expectation is that that the
 
06:01:48.948 --> 06:01:48.958 align:start position:0%
restaurant or food establishment has
 
06:01:50.628 --> 06:01:50.638 align:start position:0%
policies and procedures that are
 
06:01:53.830 --> 06:01:53.840 align:start position:0%
protective during all hours of of um the
 
06:01:56.628 --> 06:01:56.638 align:start position:0%
operation whether it be allergen control
 
06:01:58.830 --> 06:01:58.840 align:start position:0%
whether it be San ation practices
 
06:02:00.750 --> 06:02:00.760 align:start position:0%
whether it be employee health and
 
06:02:03.830 --> 06:02:03.840 align:start position:0%
hygiene so the having that higher level
 
06:02:06.788 --> 06:02:06.798 align:start position:0%
certified person on staff the idea is
 
06:02:09.548 --> 06:02:09.558 align:start position:0%
even in in ours when there is a lower
 
06:02:11.990 --> 06:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
risk operation happening that those you
 
06:02:13.708 --> 06:02:13.718 align:start position:0%
know prerequisite policies and
 
06:02:15.910 --> 06:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
procedures would still be carried
 
06:02:18.270 --> 06:02:18.280 align:start position:0%
carried forward even in the absence of
 
06:02:21.430 --> 06:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
that person being physically on site and
 
06:02:24.190 --> 06:02:24.200 align:start position:0%
this this aspect is something follow up
 
06:02:26.430 --> 06:02:26.440 align:start position:0%
and this this aspect is something that
 
06:02:28.350 --> 06:02:28.360 align:start position:0%
you have thoroughly thought
 
06:02:32.070 --> 06:02:32.080 align:start position:0%
through yes we believe that that this
 
06:02:34.270 --> 06:02:34.280 align:start position:0%
that there are um that there are certain
 
06:02:36.070 --> 06:02:36.080 align:start position:0%
instances where we can allow some
 
06:02:38.788 --> 06:02:38.798 align:start position:0%
flexibility you know and certainly if we
 
06:02:40.310 --> 06:02:40.320 align:start position:0%
um you know through an inspection
 
06:02:41.830 --> 06:02:41.840 align:start position:0%
process find
 
06:02:44.948 --> 06:02:44.958 align:start position:0%
volitive um situations time after time
 
06:02:46.430 --> 06:02:46.440 align:start position:0%
again we can always make that
 
06:02:49.750 --> 06:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
recommendation that they have um that
 
06:02:51.350 --> 06:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
certified food protection manager
 
06:02:54.468 --> 06:02:54.478 align:start position:0%
present during longer times but but um
 
06:02:58.070 --> 06:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
we're hopeful that with um with what we
 
06:03:01.110 --> 06:03:01.120 align:start position:0%
have crafted is that uh we won't be in
 
06:03:01.120 --> 06:03:02.190 align:start position:0%
have crafted is that uh we won't be in
that

06:03:02.190 --> 06:03:02.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:03:06.948 --> 06:03:06.958 align:start position:0%
situation um at all okay thank you sure
 
06:03:06.958 --> 06:03:09.830 align:start position:0%
situation um at all okay thank you sure
representative

06:03:09.830 --> 06:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:12.548 --> 06:03:12.558 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you madam chair I just want
 
06:03:15.190 --> 06:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
to follow up on the chair's question in
 
06:03:18.548 --> 06:03:18.558 align:start position:0%
regards to rulemaking so is there Ru
 
06:03:22.628 --> 06:03:22.638 align:start position:0%
making currently in is it in the process
 
06:03:25.310 --> 06:03:25.320 align:start position:0%
um to address this
 
06:03:28.548 --> 06:03:28.558 align:start position:0%
issue yes we have started Ed Ru making
 
06:03:31.070 --> 06:03:31.080 align:start position:0%
that would have um very it would have
 
06:03:33.708 --> 06:03:33.718 align:start position:0%
mirror the language that's presented in
 
06:03:33.718 --> 06:03:37.030 align:start position:0%
mirror the language that's presented in
this

06:03:37.030 --> 06:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:39.750 --> 06:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
bill followup
 
06:03:42.510 --> 06:03:42.520 align:start position:0%
followup is it normal practice to do Ru
 
06:03:46.670 --> 06:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:49.990 --> 06:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
adopted so we had um in our discussions
 
06:03:52.948 --> 06:03:52.958 align:start position:0%
with Senator GAA we had um said that we
 
06:03:55.030 --> 06:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
were plan you know since we've been
 
06:03:57.548 --> 06:03:57.558 align:start position:0%
working on updating this Rule and
 
06:03:59.628 --> 06:03:59.638 align:start position:0%
crafting the language for several months
 
06:04:02.990 --> 06:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
now and not knowing what was going to be
 
06:04:05.390 --> 06:04:05.400 align:start position:0%
um the outcome of this bill so we wanted
 
06:04:08.628 --> 06:04:08.638 align:start position:0%
to have both options
 
06:04:12.590 --> 06:04:12.600 align:start position:0%
available followup followup so can this
 
06:04:18.310 --> 06:04:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:22.110 --> 06:04:22.120 align:start position:0%
place this this language into the
 
06:04:25.948 --> 06:04:25.958 align:start position:0%
statute so that um that would be again
 
06:04:27.350 --> 06:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
we haven't gone through the full r Ru
 
06:04:28.868 --> 06:04:28.878 align:start position:0%
making process the public hearing
 
06:04:32.150 --> 06:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
process but but certainly um I I think
 
06:04:34.910 --> 06:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
there is a pathway for both both Avenues
 
06:04:38.230 --> 06:04:38.240 align:start position:0%
whether it be in in legis in in a
 
06:04:39.590 --> 06:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
statute or in
 
06:04:44.548 --> 06:04:44.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:50.110 --> 06:04:50.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:53.190 --> 06:04:53.200 align:start position:0%
questions representative fellows thank
 
06:04:55.468 --> 06:04:55.478 align:start position:0%
you madam chair
 
06:04:59.830 --> 06:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
um just a on the same lines that um
 
06:05:03.350 --> 06:05:03.360 align:start position:0%
we've been speaking do you anticipate
 
06:05:06.110 --> 06:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
that the rules will have some kind of
 
06:05:09.990 --> 06:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
guidelines for these situations when the
 
06:05:15.070 --> 06:05:15.080 align:start position:0%
um person needs to be an an employee but
 
06:05:17.390 --> 06:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to be on site for example
 
06:05:19.350 --> 06:05:19.360 align:start position:0%
will it say that they need to inspect
 
06:05:23.830 --> 06:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
once a week or something along that
 
06:05:27.628 --> 06:05:27.638 align:start position:0%
line so we have not put in that type of
 
06:05:30.350 --> 06:05:30.360 align:start position:0%
detail in our proposed rule right now
 
06:05:33.230 --> 06:05:33.240 align:start position:0%
the the language that we are proposing
 
06:05:36.510 --> 06:05:36.520 align:start position:0%
in rule is is very much um mirroring
 
06:05:45.190 --> 06:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:51.430 --> 06:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:54.190 --> 06:05:54.200 align:start position:0%
questions does anyone else wish to
 
06:06:00.910 --> 06:06:00.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:04.350 --> 06:06:04.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:07.670 --> 06:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
hand gets their bills
 
06:06:07.680 --> 06:06:11.110 align:start position:0%
hand gets their bills
change

06:06:11.110 --> 06:06:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:14.190 --> 06:06:14.200 align:start position:0%
employees thank you represent sitech for
 
06:06:14.200 --> 06:06:16.270 align:start position:0%
employees thank you represent sitech for
that

06:06:16.270 --> 06:06:16.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:06:21.230 --> 06:06:21.240 align:start position:0%
correction I don't see any hands up so
 
06:06:23.110 --> 06:06:23.120 align:start position:0%
no since no one else seems to want to
 
06:06:25.590 --> 06:06:25.600 align:start position:0%
speak is there anyone else who wishes to
 
06:06:28.110 --> 06:06:28.120 align:start position:0%
speak on a pre section that didn't get
 
06:06:34.510 --> 06:06:34.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:37.750 --> 06:06:37.760 align:start position:0%
to still no hands so I will close the
 
06:06:41.270 --> 06:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
public hearing thank you all for lasting
 
06:06:44.150 --> 06:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
through it and the subcommittees will
 
06:06:49.270 --> 06:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:52.990 --> 06:06:53.000 align:start position:0%
tomorrow question of the chair yes sir
 
06:06:54.990 --> 06:06:55.000 align:start position:0%
so uh are
 
06:06:57.990 --> 06:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
we obviously we didn't hear from Senator
 
06:07:00.910 --> 06:07:00.920 align:start position:0%
Reagan in spite of our best efforts uh
 
06:07:03.708 --> 06:07:03.718 align:start position:0%
do we have any any Outreach to him with
 
06:07:06.190 --> 06:07:06.200 align:start position:0%
regard to any remarks he would have made
 
06:07:10.670 --> 06:07:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:14.350 --> 06:07:14.360 align:start position:0%
available I think his constituent
 
06:07:18.390 --> 06:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
and U Miss Smith probably said as much
 
06:07:22.510 --> 06:07:22.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:24.830 --> 06:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
have well I know I appreciate the
 
06:07:28.468 --> 06:07:28.478 align:start position:0%
technical expertise from Mr San and Miss
 
06:07:31.390 --> 06:07:31.400 align:start position:0%
Smith entirely just that you know we
 
06:07:33.868 --> 06:07:33.878 align:start position:0%
certainly made our best effort to try to
 
06:07:35.590 --> 06:07:35.600 align:start position:0%
contact senator
 
06:07:35.600 --> 06:07:37.708 align:start position:0%
contact senator

question from representative scitech I'm
 
06:07:48.510 --> 06:07:48.520 align:start position:0%
just wonder isn't this current practice
 
06:07:50.110 --> 06:07:50.120 align:start position:0%
I mean this is the way things are
 
06:07:51.830 --> 06:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
operating right now in New Hampshire
 
06:07:51.840 --> 06:07:55.830 align:start position:0%
operating right now in New Hampshire
right

06:07:55.830 --> 06:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:55.840 --> 06:07:58.310 align:start position:0%
 
well

06:07:58.310 --> 06:07:58.320 align:start position:0%

06:08:10.350 --> 06:08:10.360 align:start position:0%
reopening the hearing so would you would
 
06:08:12.110 --> 06:08:12.120 align:start position:0%
you explain if this is current practice
 
06:08:15.868 --> 06:08:15.878 align:start position:0%
or not there I didn't mean to reopen the
 
06:08:17.868 --> 06:08:17.878 align:start position:0%
hearing I just take advantage of the
 
06:08:19.948 --> 06:08:19.958 align:start position:0%
fact that you're here isn't this current
 
06:08:21.708 --> 06:08:21.718 align:start position:0%
practice people aren't you know we
 
06:08:23.310 --> 06:08:23.320 align:start position:0%
haven't had youth mentioned there's
 
06:08:25.030 --> 06:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
really been no
 
06:08:28.310 --> 06:08:28.320 align:start position:0%
issues that correct
 
06:08:31.030 --> 06:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
I I'm so I'm sorry just looking for some
 
06:08:35.150 --> 06:08:35.160 align:start position:0%
clarification no issues on uh on the
 
06:08:36.990 --> 06:08:37.000 align:start position:0%
enforcing the
 
06:08:39.868 --> 06:08:39.878 align:start position:0%
requirement in the in the area touched
 
06:08:42.510 --> 06:08:42.520 align:start position:0%
by this bill are you having problem
 
06:08:48.150 --> 06:08:48.160 align:start position:0%
problems with restaurants uh with uh
 
06:08:51.510 --> 06:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
that with food poisoning with issues I
 
06:08:55.350 --> 06:08:55.360 align:start position:0%
mean it seems things seem to be running
 
06:08:59.788 --> 06:08:59.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:03.110 --> 06:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
so I mean I mean this is a casual after
 
06:09:05.510 --> 06:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
the casual conversation after the
 
06:09:07.628 --> 06:09:07.638 align:start position:0%
hearing it's too bad it's like this but
 
06:09:10.670 --> 06:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
this is chat what I'm I
 
06:09:13.390 --> 06:09:13.400 align:start position:0%
just why is this happening why is it
 
06:09:16.230 --> 06:09:16.240 align:start position:0%
still happening because the feds the
 
06:09:16.240 --> 06:09:20.190 align:start position:0%
still happening because the feds the
feds

06:09:20.190 --> 06:09:20.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:23.868 --> 06:09:23.878 align:start position:0%
wanted the 2017 FDA rules that's why we
 
06:09:27.628 --> 06:09:27.638 align:start position:0%

about the anticipated schedule for the
 
06:11:32.868 --> 06:11:32.878 align:start position:0%
uh subcommittees to wrap up all their
 
06:11:37.070 --> 06:11:37.080 align:start position:0%
work because I'm on the one that has the
 
06:11:39.110 --> 06:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
almost all the bills in it and we don't
 
06:11:42.390 --> 06:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
have our first meeting until next week
 
06:11:45.868 --> 06:11:45.878 align:start position:0%
yes well the main point is
 
06:11:49.350 --> 06:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
that you need to look at is this section
 
06:11:53.350 --> 06:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
necessary and if so is it correct so if
 
06:11:56.110 --> 06:11:56.120 align:start position:0%
you can finish your work that day great
 
06:11:57.030 --> 06:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
if not
 
06:11:59.708 --> 06:11:59.718 align:start position:0%
we'll have to continue it to some later
 
06:12:01.948 --> 06:12:01.958 align:start position:0%
date okay thank
 
06:12:04.788 --> 06:12:04.798 align:start position:0%
you and Madam chair I have a question
 
06:12:07.510 --> 06:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
regarding the bills that we retained
 
06:12:10.948 --> 06:12:10.958 align:start position:0%
because um when do you think you'll be
 
06:12:10.958 --> 06:12:12.628 align:start position:0%
because um when do you think you'll be
assigning

06:12:12.628 --> 06:12:12.638 align:start position:0%
assigning
 
06:12:14.788 --> 06:12:14.798 align:start position:0%
um you know are you going to assign
 
06:12:16.670 --> 06:12:16.680 align:start position:0%
subcommittees to those retained bills
 
06:12:18.628 --> 06:12:18.638 align:start position:0%
they have all been subcommittees have
 
06:12:21.750 --> 06:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
been assigned and the notice went out uh
 
06:12:24.230 --> 06:12:24.240 align:start position:0%
several weeks ago
 
06:12:27.150 --> 06:12:27.160 align:start position:0%
actually okay one once we're through
 
06:12:28.868 --> 06:12:28.878 align:start position:0%
with the Senate bills I'll issue an
 
06:12:31.310 --> 06:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
updated list including any Senate bills
 
06:12:32.430 --> 06:12:32.440 align:start position:0%
you may be
 
06:12:35.590 --> 06:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
retaining and the ruling we have from
 
06:12:39.990 --> 06:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
the speaker is that once we have once
 
06:12:41.670 --> 06:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
we're through with our Senate bills we
 
06:12:45.390 --> 06:12:45.400 align:start position:0%
can start working on retain bills and I
 
06:12:48.150 --> 06:12:48.160 align:start position:0%
would strongly recommend that we meet at
 
06:12:53.110 --> 06:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
least once in May or June in order to
 
06:12:55.830 --> 06:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
scope out the work we want to do on the
 
06:12:58.990 --> 06:12:59.000 align:start position:0%
retain B thank you some of them may need
 
06:13:01.070 --> 06:13:01.080 align:start position:0%
research or something else and we'd like
 
06:13:04.708 --> 06:13:04.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:07.070 --> 06:13:07.080 align:start position:0%
early and Miriam would have sent that
 
06:13:11.788 --> 06:13:11.798 align:start position:0%

06:13:13.430 --> 06:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
