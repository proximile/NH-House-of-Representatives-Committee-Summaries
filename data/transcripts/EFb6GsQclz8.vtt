00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.039 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to open up the hearing
 
00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:42.639 align:start position:0%
on cacr 6 and I recognize the prime
 
00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
aan good morning uh Mr chair
 
00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 align:start position:0%
and wise members of the Judiciary
 
00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
Committee uh for the record my name is
 
00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 align:start position:0%
Keith Ammon I um represent Hillsboro
 
00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 align:start position:0%
District 42 which is the towns of New
 
00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 align:start position:0%
Boston Mount Veron and
 
00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:21.039 align:start position:0%
lineboro so I I stand before you as the
 
00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of cacr 6 it's a
 
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment that recognizes
 
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 align:start position:0%
the right of individuals to use
 
00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.870 align:start position:0%
the right of individuals to use
computation

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 align:start position:0%
computation
 
00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:35.199 align:start position:0%
resources as a fundamental
 
00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
right and this might seem like a novel
 
00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 align:start position:0%
concept and I I admit that it is um
 
00:05:44.309 --> 00:05:44.319 align:start position:0%
maybe the first try at something is
 
00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:45.629 align:start position:0%
maybe the first try at something is
something

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:45.639 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:48.199 align:start position:0%
new so as we're gathered today we're
 
00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 align:start position:0%
living in a world where Computing has
 
00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:53.759 align:start position:0%
become an essential part of our daily
 
00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440 align:start position:0%
lives from communication and education
 
00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 align:start position:0%
to economic opportunities and personal
 
00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.390 align:start position:0%
to economic opportunities and personal
expression

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
expression
 
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
Computing has revolutionalized the way
 
00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
we live work and interact with one
 
00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120 align:start position:0%
indisputable however as our Reliance on
 
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
Computing grows so do potential threats
 
00:06:15.589 --> 00:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
to our ability to access and utilize
 
00:06:15.599 --> 00:06:16.350 align:start position:0%
to our ability to access and utilize
those

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:16.360 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
resources and we've seen instances of
 
00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:20.800 align:start position:0%
governments and corporations imposing
 
00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
restrictions on internet use censoring
 
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
online content and exploiting personal
 
00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
data for their own gain
 
00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:32.800 align:start position:0%
I passed out copies of a of an article
 
00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:36.039 align:start position:0%
from the website mofo and it stands for
 
00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
Morrison Foley I
 
00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:40.039 align:start position:0%
think I just thought that was kind of
 
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
funny thank you um and it's it's an
 
00:06:45.589 --> 00:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
article about an executive order that
 
00:06:47.589 --> 00:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
President Biden signed in
 
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
2023 and this is the precedent that has
 
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
been set uh by the federal
 
00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:57.560 align:start position:0%
level that we need I think to consider
 
00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:00.800 align:start position:0%
ways to combat and that's what CA cr6 is
 
00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:06.800 align:start position:0%
do and you you can read the details in
 
00:07:10.589 --> 00:07:10.599 align:start position:0%
the article I passed out it basically
 
00:07:14.589 --> 00:07:14.599 align:start position:0%
required the registration of AI models
 
00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
over a certain level of computation a
 
00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:20.360 align:start position:0%
certain number of
 
00:07:23.189 --> 00:07:23.199 align:start position:0%
parameters so it required you to
 
00:07:25.869 --> 00:07:25.879 align:start position:0%
register uh your
 
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
AI uh it was since rescinded
 
00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:33.800 align:start position:0%
um January 21st this year when President
 
00:07:35.589 --> 00:07:35.599 align:start position:0%
Trump on his second day he rescinded
 
00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:38.120 align:start position:0%
that executive order but the the
 
00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:40.120 align:start position:0%
precedent has been set the challenge has
 
00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:40.950 align:start position:0%
precedent has been set the challenge has
been

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:07:43.869 --> 00:07:43.879 align:start position:0%
set um that
 
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
computation uh computational resources
 
00:07:50.149 --> 00:07:50.159 align:start position:0%
would need to be registered with the
 
00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:53.800 align:start position:0%
government so I'm thinking about this
 
00:07:55.909 --> 00:07:55.919 align:start position:0%
similar to the fundamental right of the
 
00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
freedom of speech the freedom of
 
00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:01.000 align:start position:0%
conscience the freedom of the press and
 
00:08:04.629 --> 00:08:04.639 align:start position:0%
maybe even the Second Amendment because
 
00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
uh using computation allows you to you
 
00:08:10.189 --> 00:08:10.199 align:start position:0%
know be more
 
00:08:13.149 --> 00:08:13.159 align:start position:0%
successful it it enhances your your
 
00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:17.080 align:start position:0%
thought processes um and I think as time
 
00:08:19.029 --> 00:08:19.039 align:start position:0%
goes on we're going to see that uh
 
00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
become more and more true and more and
 
00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:25.400 align:start position:0%
more essential for our survival and our
 
00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:29.000 align:start position:0%
Liberty so uh look look at that
 
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:30.800 align:start position:0%
executive order the article about the
 
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
executive order I urge you to uh to
 
00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.310 align:start position:0%
executive order I urge you to uh to
consider

00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
consider
 
00:08:37.469 --> 00:08:37.479 align:start position:0%
that so the executive order raised
 
00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:38.919 align:start position:0%
significant concerns about the potential
 
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
for government control over AI
 
00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:43.320 align:start position:0%
development and deployment it also
 
00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:45.160 align:start position:0%
sparked debates about the balance
 
00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:47.000 align:start position:0%
between Innovation and regulation in the
 
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
tech industry and as policy makers it's
 
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
our responsibility to ensure that any
 
00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
regulations or laws related to Computing
 
00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:56.680 align:start position:0%
are fair transparent respectful of
 
00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:57.870 align:start position:0%
are fair transparent respectful of
individual

00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:57.880 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
rights and that's why I think it's
 
00:09:02.509 --> 00:09:02.519 align:start position:0%
essential that we take a proactive step
 
00:09:04.389 --> 00:09:04.399 align:start position:0%
to protect the rights of of the citizens
 
00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:07.160 align:start position:0%
in the digital age cacr 6 aims to do
 
00:09:08.829 --> 00:09:08.839 align:start position:0%
just that by establishing the right to
 
00:09:10.949 --> 00:09:10.959 align:start position:0%
compute as a fundamental right protected
 
00:09:12.509 --> 00:09:12.519 align:start position:0%
by the state
 
00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:15.090 align:start position:0%
constitution I if it were
 
00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:16.430 align:start position:0%
constitution I if it were
[Music]

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
adopted so in
 
00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
closing I urge you to consider this uh I
 
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
urge you to think about it and uh
 
00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:27.480 align:start position:0%
consider the need the potential need for
 
00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
this as a as a protected right enshrined
 
00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
in our
 
00:09:35.829 --> 00:09:35.839 align:start position:0%
Constitution and with that I'll be happy
 
00:09:36.949 --> 00:09:36.959 align:start position:0%
to take any
 
00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
questions questions representative
 
00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
McFarland thank you representative Ammon
 
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
um my first question is with regard to
 
00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:50.800 align:start position:0%
the wording of the article I notice that
 
00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:53.560 align:start position:0%
you don't speak to encryption uh what
 
00:09:55.389 --> 00:09:55.399 align:start position:0%
are your thoughts on a possible
 
00:09:58.269 --> 00:09:58.279 align:start position:0%
Amendment to the article um that is
 
00:10:00.269 --> 00:10:00.279 align:start position:0%
proposed here that would
 
00:10:02.949 --> 00:10:02.959 align:start position:0%
address that as as part of this
 
00:10:06.509 --> 00:10:06.519 align:start position:0%
right that's a very good question
 
00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
um because
 
00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
encryption uh necessarily involves
 
00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:14.440 align:start position:0%
computation whether you're
 
00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:17.160 align:start position:0%
doing a math problem on a piece of paper
 
00:10:20.949 --> 00:10:20.959 align:start position:0%
or using highlevel computation to really
 
00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
firmly encrypt something I think it's
 
00:10:27.389 --> 00:10:27.399 align:start position:0%
sort of implied follow up follow up so
 
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
while I would tend to agree with you in
 
00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:31.720 align:start position:0%
my interpretation I imagine that there
 
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
would be a lot of other interpretations
 
00:10:35.629 --> 00:10:35.639 align:start position:0%
do you think that changing the language
 
00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:38.240 align:start position:0%
in that way would make it less likely to
 
00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:40.680 align:start position:0%
pause uh I don't know I'd have to see
 
00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
the language it should be simple clear
 
00:10:44.829 --> 00:10:44.839 align:start position:0%
and easy to understand because it's
 
00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
going out to the citizens of New
 
00:10:51.389 --> 00:10:51.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to vote on so that would be my
 
00:10:53.949 --> 00:10:53.959 align:start position:0%
uh desire is that whatever if you if you
 
00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:55.480 align:start position:0%
have an amendment that it's simple and
 
00:10:59.509 --> 00:10:59.519 align:start position:0%
clear thank you representative TR thank
 
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking the
 
00:11:04.629 --> 00:11:04.639 align:start position:0%
question um building on are similar to
 
00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
um what representative McFarland just
 
00:11:08.949 --> 00:11:08.959 align:start position:0%
asked I read it's obviously there's only
 
00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:10.760 align:start position:0%
two sentences to this so when I read the
 
00:11:12.509 --> 00:11:12.519 align:start position:0%
first sentence the right of individuals
 
00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:14.440 align:start position:0%
to freely access use and employ
 
00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.629 align:start position:0%
to freely access use and employ
computation

00:11:15.629 --> 00:11:15.639 align:start position:0%
computation
 
00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
resources including devices and networks
 
00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:21.200 align:start position:0%
essential to computation shall not be
 
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
infringed that to me sounds like it
 
00:11:26.269 --> 00:11:26.279 align:start position:0%
could interfere with all forms of
 
00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:28.680 align:start position:0%
security not just encryption but all
 
00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
sorts of authentication access to
 
00:11:35.629 --> 00:11:35.639 align:start position:0%
private networks to public networks um I
 
00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:38.680 align:start position:0%
agree with your basic premise that our
 
00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:40.200 align:start position:0%
lives are hugely dependent on
 
00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:42.040 align:start position:0%
computational resources and and
 
00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
restricting them could have severe
 
00:11:46.069 --> 00:11:46.079 align:start position:0%
consequences but the language here
 
00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:48.920 align:start position:0%
worries me I see the next sentence says
 
00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
discriminatory um but I'm not really
 
00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
sure how discriminatory would would in
 
00:11:54.509 --> 00:11:54.519 align:start position:0%
any way limit what the first sentence
 
00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
says could you say a little bit more
 
00:11:59.230 --> 00:11:59.240 align:start position:0%
about your thinking there yeah thank
 
00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:02.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um just like
 
00:12:05.389 --> 00:12:05.399 align:start position:0%
the freedom of the press right doesn't
 
00:12:07.509 --> 00:12:07.519 align:start position:0%
it doesn't demand that you have access
 
00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
to all the presses or be provided a
 
00:12:14.829 --> 00:12:14.839 align:start position:0%
press right it's it's the ability to
 
00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
express yourself using you know the
 
00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
Press was a machine that pressed copy
 
00:12:23.189 --> 00:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
onto paper right that was what a press
 
00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:27.320 align:start position:0%
was um the computer is just a more
 
00:12:29.509 --> 00:12:29.519 align:start position:0%
complicated version of that and you know
 
00:12:32.509 --> 00:12:32.519 align:start position:0%
a less materialized version of that and
 
00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:34.760 align:start position:0%
so you know similar to freedom of the
 
00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
press this would be the freedom to use
 
00:12:39.189 --> 00:12:39.199 align:start position:0%
computational resources it doesn't mean
 
00:12:42.389 --> 00:12:42.399 align:start position:0%
that you can impose yourself on other
 
00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
people's resources and computation with
 
00:12:47.069 --> 00:12:47.079 align:start position:0%
encryption it
 
00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:50.720 align:start position:0%
creates barriers that prevent you you
 
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
know you'd have to defy the laws of
 
00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
physics maybe to break encryption to
 
00:12:58.509 --> 00:12:58.519 align:start position:0%
access some access someone else's
 
00:13:00.189 --> 00:13:00.199 align:start position:0%
private information
 
00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:02.360 align:start position:0%
that's protected by encryption so I
 
00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
think I think the right sort of balances
 
00:13:08.629 --> 00:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
it representative
 
00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you very much um I'm a lite
 
00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:19.240 align:start position:0%
and to me computation is addition
 
00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.750 align:start position:0%
and to me computation is addition
subtraction

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
subtraction
 
00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:22.240 align:start position:0%
multiplication yeah that's the
 
00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:25.880 align:start position:0%
foundation of it and after that I'm on
 
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
very thin
 
00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:32.440 align:start position:0%
ice but I'm thinking about a number of
 
00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
bills that we have had this
 
00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
term that deal with um abuses against
 
00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:45.189 align:start position:0%
term that deal with um abuses against
children

00:13:45.189 --> 00:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:48.120 align:start position:0%
and those
 
00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
bills generate not
 
00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:55.160 align:start position:0%
just neutral academic response but
 
00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:57.560 align:start position:0%
certainly emotional response and I
 
00:14:01.389 --> 00:14:01.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:03.629 --> 00:14:03.639 align:start position:0%
but if I read
 
00:14:03.639 --> 00:14:07.629 align:start position:0%
but if I read
this

00:14:07.629 --> 00:14:07.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
um if someone has been involved for
 
00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:14.920 align:start position:0%
example in child
 
00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
pornography that's a very serious thing
 
00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
that you're you're bringing
 
00:14:23.189 --> 00:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
and if there's been an attempt in the
 
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
best interests of the people of the
 
00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
state to
 
00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:41.240 align:start position:0%
protect the the rest of us
 
00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:44.440 align:start position:0%
from public from from from this
 
00:14:47.949 --> 00:14:47.959 align:start position:0%
individual having access to child
 
00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:50.360 align:start position:0%
pornography you're talking about using
 
00:14:53.629 --> 00:14:53.639 align:start position:0%
computation in the commission of a crime
 
00:14:56.749 --> 00:14:56.759 align:start position:0%
a very serious crime in this case but
 
00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:00.040 align:start position:0%
using abusing a right rights don't have
 
00:15:02.069 --> 00:15:02.079 align:start position:0%
rights aren't unlimited right and if you
 
00:15:04.749 --> 00:15:04.759 align:start position:0%
look at the language of the amendment it
 
00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
covers the scenario that you're
 
00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
describing help help me see where
 
00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
representative would you read the the
 
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
first sentence for
 
00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
me freely access use and employ
 
00:15:17.189 --> 00:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
computation resour
 
00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
oh devices and networks essential for
 
00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:21.720 align:start position:0%
conversation shall not be infringed no
 
00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
law regulation shall impose
 
00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:25.880 align:start position:0%
discriminatory rat restrictions or
 
00:15:28.309 --> 00:15:28.319 align:start position:0%
limitations that unreasonably burden
 
00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:29.519 align:start position:0%
that right
 
00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
right so unreasonably would be one of
 
00:15:34.629 --> 00:15:34.639 align:start position:0%
the one of the qualifiers in in that so
 
00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:37.160 align:start position:0%
just like we have the right we have the
 
00:15:38.949 --> 00:15:38.959 align:start position:0%
First Amendment right the right to bear
 
00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:41.160 align:start position:0%
arms but if we go the First Amendment
 
00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:42.230 align:start position:0%
arms but if we go the First Amendment
even

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
even
 
00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
I I do know that um but we don't have a
 
00:15:47.509 --> 00:15:47.519 align:start position:0%
right to go around shooting people
 
00:15:49.629 --> 00:15:49.639 align:start position:0%
willy-nilly right that that would be
 
00:15:51.629 --> 00:15:51.639 align:start position:0%
abusing that right and therefore we
 
00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:54.440 align:start position:0%
don't deserve it in that case so it
 
00:15:56.269 --> 00:15:56.279 align:start position:0%
would be the same standard would apply
 
00:15:59.910 --> 00:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
to this this potential right thank you
 
00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative
 
00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
Horgan yes these Ai and then other U
 
00:16:09.749 --> 00:16:09.759 align:start position:0%
emerging Technologies I know you're
 
00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
personally interested in like Bitcoin
 
00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:13.000 align:start position:0%
and blockchain they use an immense
 
00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
amount of uh electricity and often the
 
00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:17.560 align:start position:0%
servers uh there's a lot of
 
00:16:19.309 --> 00:16:19.319 align:start position:0%
externalities Associated the servers
 
00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:20.440 align:start position:0%
because they aside from using
 
00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:22.360 align:start position:0%
electricity they often generate heat and
 
00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
noise and you know there's been some um
 
00:16:28.309 --> 00:16:28.319 align:start position:0%
so does the does this interfere with the
 
00:16:29.829 --> 00:16:29.839 align:start position:0%
States you know you know responsibility
 
00:16:32.269 --> 00:16:32.279 align:start position:0%
to you know conserve energy and manage
 
00:16:34.829 --> 00:16:34.839 align:start position:0%
the power grid and just make sure uh the
 
00:16:34.839 --> 00:16:36.189 align:start position:0%
the power grid and just make sure uh the
infrastructure

00:16:36.189 --> 00:16:36.199 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
00:16:38.509 --> 00:16:38.519 align:start position:0%
operates operates fairly for everyone
 
00:16:40.269 --> 00:16:40.279 align:start position:0%
involved and that you know these AI
 
00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
servers and whatnot don't like
 
00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:44.680 align:start position:0%
monopolize the power supply you know to
 
00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:47.240 align:start position:0%
the you know to the detriment of like
 
00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:50.600 align:start position:0%
other uses of uh of the power supply
 
00:16:52.509 --> 00:16:52.519 align:start position:0%
could did you explain that question yes
 
00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:55.160 align:start position:0%
well we had a lot of problems well
 
00:16:56.629 --> 00:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
certainly with Bitcoin you know there
 
00:16:58.309 --> 00:16:58.319 align:start position:0%
was like uh when it came in there a lot
 
00:17:00.269 --> 00:17:00.279 align:start position:0%
of small uh entrepreneurs who would set
 
00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
up these Bitcoin centers in various
 
00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:04.360 align:start position:0%
remote places near hydr power which
 
00:17:05.909 --> 00:17:05.919 align:start position:0%
would often like create problems for the
 
00:17:08.029 --> 00:17:08.039 align:start position:0%
neighbors and then on a larger thing
 
00:17:11.669 --> 00:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
with the AI um you know like Google for
 
00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
example I think I believe it was uh well
 
00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
now I forget which um Google or one of
 
00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:19.000 align:start position:0%
the other like major players for example
 
00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:21.640 align:start position:0%
is going to reopen The Three Mile Island
 
00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:24.160 align:start position:0%
nuclear plant and build a huge AI Farm
 
00:17:25.789 --> 00:17:25.799 align:start position:0%
around it so that's obviously there's a
 
00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:28.600 align:start position:0%
lot of electricity a lot of power being
 
00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:30.760 align:start position:0%
used on that and then do in the state of
 
00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:34.520 align:start position:0%
some responsibility to like uh at least
 
00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:36.200 align:start position:0%
keep that in check so like that one
 
00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
particular segment the economy doesn't
 
00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:39.720 align:start position:0%
crowd out everything else in the economy
 
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
and you know use up all the available
 
00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:42.990 align:start position:0%
and you know use up all the available
energy

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:43.000 align:start position:0%
energy
 
00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
Supply I guess I don't have that same
 
00:17:46.909 --> 00:17:46.919 align:start position:0%
fear that it's going to eat up the whole
 
00:17:50.549 --> 00:17:50.559 align:start position:0%
economy it seems kind of far-fetched to
 
00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:52.890 align:start position:0%
be you know just in in my opinion
 
00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:54.310 align:start position:0%
be you know just in in my opinion
[Music]

00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:17:58.830 --> 00:17:58.840 align:start position:0%
um we're talking about a uh National sec
 
00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:01.320 align:start position:0%
SEC issue when you talk about AI
 
00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:04.640 align:start position:0%
building AI D data centers if if our
 
00:18:09.029 --> 00:18:09.039 align:start position:0%
government slows down the advancement of
 
00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:10.360 align:start position:0%
AI in this
 
00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:12.440 align:start position:0%
country do you think China's going to do
 
00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:13.640 align:start position:0%
the same thing do you think Russia's
 
00:18:16.029 --> 00:18:16.039 align:start position:0%
going to do the same thing so we're in a
 
00:18:20.669 --> 00:18:20.679 align:start position:0%
we're in a a very large and fast
 
00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:23.320 align:start position:0%
competition right now and it has to do
 
00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:26.600 align:start position:0%
with providing efficient compute and
 
00:18:29.149 --> 00:18:29.159 align:start position:0%
feeding it with energy and so that these
 
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
AI models can be trained and get smarter
 
00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:34.200 align:start position:0%
and bigger so I I just don't see that
 
00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
it's going to eat up the economy I think
 
00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
it's a tool that's very useful uh that
 
00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
we should encourage China will
 
00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
definitely do the same thing Russia
 
00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
seems to be society and declined I'm not
 
00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:47.240 align:start position:0%
sure but anyway thanks for your answer
 
00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:49.000 align:start position:0%
all right thank you representative
 
00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
mayos thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:18:54.149 --> 00:18:54.159 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I don't have the
 
00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
article you were referring to so I'm
 
00:18:59.590 --> 00:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could um
 
00:19:02.029 --> 00:19:02.039 align:start position:0%
specify what your concerns were with
 
00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
President Biden's executive order I
 
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
don't have it I don't have what I I
 
00:19:08.029 --> 00:19:08.039 align:start position:0%
passed out all the copies that I was
 
00:19:09.909 --> 00:19:09.919 align:start position:0%
able to print okay so I'm just going to
 
00:19:13.789 --> 00:19:13.799 align:start position:0%
go off of memory um it's the first time
 
00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
that the government the federal
 
00:19:17.909 --> 00:19:17.919 align:start position:0%
government demanded that if you're if
 
00:19:20.029 --> 00:19:20.039 align:start position:0%
you have powerful computation that you
 
00:19:21.549 --> 00:19:21.559 align:start position:0%
have to register that with the
 
00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
government you have to regularly report
 
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
on it to the government as if as if it's
 
00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:29.400 align:start position:0%
a dangerous nuclear weapon
 
00:19:30.789 --> 00:19:30.799 align:start position:0%
that's the way they treated it as if it
 
00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:33.640 align:start position:0%
was file material that could give us all
 
00:19:37.029 --> 00:19:37.039 align:start position:0%
radiation poisoning it's it's a computer
 
00:19:39.149 --> 00:19:39.159 align:start position:0%
it's a big computer but it's the first
 
00:19:40.909 --> 00:19:40.919 align:start position:0%
time that that's ever happened and so
 
00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
the precedent has been set um it's true
 
00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:45.480 align:start position:0%
that it was
 
00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
rescinded but only because an election
 
00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:49.960 align:start position:0%
was won right if the if the election
 
00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
went the other way that that order would
 
00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
still be in effect today so I think it's
 
00:19:57.710 --> 00:19:57.720 align:start position:0%
it's incumbent on us as as a state with
 
00:20:00.669 --> 00:20:00.679 align:start position:0%
our own constitution enshrining rights
 
00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
into it that we can consider that this
 
00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
might be a right that we should enshrine
 
00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
because it's only going to get more
 
00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:12.760 align:start position:0%
embedded into our way of life like our
 
00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:15.200 align:start position:0%
expression is only going to it it's
 
00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
going to be Amplified through
 
00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
computation more and more and so it
 
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
should be considered an extension of our
 
00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
of our thought process and our our
 
00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:28.760 align:start position:0%
conscience so in in my view I mean just
 
00:20:30.669 --> 00:20:30.679 align:start position:0%
presenting this as a as an potential
 
00:20:35.029 --> 00:20:35.039 align:start position:0%
idea so thank you you have a followup
 
00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:38.120 align:start position:0%
thank you um I wasn't really I haven't
 
00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
read the I now have the article but I
 
00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:41.640 align:start position:0%
haven't read it but could you be a
 
00:20:43.669 --> 00:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
little more specific about what you were
 
00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:45.720 align:start position:0%
talking about about you mentioned I
 
00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:48.440 align:start position:0%
think registering you mentioned two
 
00:20:51.149 --> 00:20:51.159 align:start position:0%
words registering and something else
 
00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:53.480 align:start position:0%
that was required regular reporting
 
00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
regular so it was the Secretary of
 
00:20:58.789 --> 00:20:58.799 align:start position:0%
Commerce was empowered to
 
00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:01.640 align:start position:0%
make sure that they had the whole
 
00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
industry registered so if your AI
 
00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
compute model was a certain size and
 
00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
it's in the executive order certain
 
00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:11.720 align:start position:0%
level of computation certain number of
 
00:21:14.549 --> 00:21:14.559 align:start position:0%
parameters for your large language model
 
00:21:17.149 --> 00:21:17.159 align:start position:0%
if it met that threshold then you had to
 
00:21:20.029 --> 00:21:20.039 align:start position:0%
register your model with the government
 
00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
and regularly report on your activity
 
00:21:26.909 --> 00:21:26.919 align:start position:0%
and sort of uh explain yourself you know
 
00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:29.480 align:start position:0%
on on a certain tricks on what you were
 
00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:30.799 align:start position:0%
doing how you were training it and all
 
00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
these other things so it's the first
 
00:21:34.789 --> 00:21:34.799 align:start position:0%
time it's happened I'm just saying like
 
00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:38.200 align:start position:0%
it um maybe we want to push back against
 
00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:38.950 align:start position:0%
it um maybe we want to push back against
that

00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:42.200 align:start position:0%
precedent so thank you do do you think
 
00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
that might limit or sty people that want
 
00:21:47.669 --> 00:21:47.679 align:start position:0%
to do this work they might say maybe
 
00:21:49.149 --> 00:21:49.159 align:start position:0%
I'll stay out of it is it going to limit
 
00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
our ability to compete if we have to
 
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
register these things it potentially
 
00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:55.400 align:start position:0%
could I mean I don't know if you saw
 
00:21:57.430 --> 00:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
what Europe is doing and it's like only
 
00:21:59.950 --> 00:21:59.960 align:start position:0%
in the last day or to they're you know
 
00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
they're putting a bunch of money towards
 
00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
AI but they're also completely
 
00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
micromanaging it right and I think in
 
00:22:07.909 --> 00:22:07.919 align:start position:0%
that environment it would stifle our
 
00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:09.640 align:start position:0%
ability to compete and it also
 
00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:12.120 align:start position:0%
concentrates power into the hands of a
 
00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
few corporations that have the lawyers
 
00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
and the technical knowhow right it it
 
00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:20.360 align:start position:0%
stifles the the startups and the you
 
00:22:23.269 --> 00:22:23.279 align:start position:0%
know the next potential big idea could
 
00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
be stifled so representative mcfallen
 
00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:29.080 align:start position:0%
you had one then thank you thank you Mr
 
00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:33.320 align:start position:0%
chairman uh would you agree
 
00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
that for those people who might be
 
00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
looking at this Constitutional Amendment
 
00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:41.200 align:start position:0%
and saying why now why in this state why
 
00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:43.320 align:start position:0%
is this not an issue for somebody else
 
00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:44.840 align:start position:0%
or an issue at the federal
 
00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
level that we here in this committee um
 
00:22:50.669 --> 00:22:50.679 align:start position:0%
received testimony as U representative
 
00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
Smith was alluding to a week ago on
 
00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
293 um which is is legislation that
 
00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
intends to prevent minors from accessing
 
00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:04.760 align:start position:0%
obscenity but actually acts to restrict
 
00:23:06.789 --> 00:23:06.799 align:start position:0%
people's ability to compute would you
 
00:23:09.909 --> 00:23:09.919 align:start position:0%
agree that this is a a present issue not
 
00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
only nationally and internationally but
 
00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:16.120 align:start position:0%
in this state and that we already have
 
00:23:19.789 --> 00:23:19.799 align:start position:0%
in the example of um article 2A uh where
 
00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
there's a broad constitutional uh
 
00:23:23.269 --> 00:23:23.279 align:start position:0%
protection for the right to keep and
 
00:23:26.549 --> 00:23:26.559 align:start position:0%
bear arms we still have reasonable
 
00:23:29.549 --> 00:23:29.559 align:start position:0%
legislation uh and some might even say
 
00:23:31.669 --> 00:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
overburdensome legislation that has been
 
00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:33.080 align:start position:0%
upheld by the
 
00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:34.830 align:start position:0%
upheld by the
courts

00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:34.840 align:start position:0%
courts
 
00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh based on my understanding of what you
 
00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
just described I do agree with that yeah
 
00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
thanks representative tur yeah thank you
 
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking another question yeah
 
00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:50.360 align:start position:0%
um so quick read of this of this article
 
00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:53.000 align:start position:0%
that you handed out it's focused on
 
00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:55.640 align:start position:0%
registration and Reporting um not
 
00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
passing judgment on whether that's good
 
00:23:59.390 --> 00:23:59.400 align:start position:0%
or not um
 
00:24:02.149 --> 00:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
how does that cross over to the
 
00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:04.480 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment that you are
 
00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:08.200 align:start position:0%
proposing which really doesn't seem to
 
00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:10.760 align:start position:0%
impact the idea of registration and
 
00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
Reporting but seems to imply a leap to
 
00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:17.320 align:start position:0%
some form of restriction that I don't
 
00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:20.600 align:start position:0%
see in this in this uh executive order
 
00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:23.000 align:start position:0%
or or maybe the flip side why didn't you
 
00:24:24.909 --> 00:24:24.919 align:start position:0%
target this directly rather than the way
 
00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:27.240 align:start position:0%
that this this is worded it's a broadly
 
00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:28.909 align:start position:0%
that this this is worded it's a broadly
stated

00:24:28.909 --> 00:24:28.919 align:start position:0%
stated
 
00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:32.840 align:start position:0%
right um so my question I guess could I
 
00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:34.760 align:start position:0%
if I could ask you a question in return
 
00:24:38.149 --> 00:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
if I was developing a large AI model and
 
00:24:41.389 --> 00:24:41.399 align:start position:0%
I didn't comply with registering it or
 
00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:43.240 align:start position:0%
reporting on it what would happen to me
 
00:24:45.909 --> 00:24:45.919 align:start position:0%
and my company and you know my resources
 
00:24:49.549 --> 00:24:49.559 align:start position:0%
right there's there's always and or else
 
00:24:52.909 --> 00:24:52.919 align:start position:0%
whenever there's a demand for reporting
 
00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:55.960 align:start position:0%
and you know registration so that that
 
00:24:58.710 --> 00:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
would be my response is it's the or else
 
00:25:02.389 --> 00:25:02.399 align:start position:0%
that we're pushing back against yeah and
 
00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
again just sorry followup because you
 
00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:07.240 align:start position:0%
did ask um I think what I what I'm
 
00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
saying is registration and aggregate
 
00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:13.480 align:start position:0%
reporting of of your activities I mean
 
00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:15.200 align:start position:0%
if those are in place not passing
 
00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:17.440 align:start position:0%
judgment good or not good or bad you
 
00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
know if that's the law then every
 
00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:22.120 align:start position:0%
organization has to comply with it um
 
00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
it's not it was an executive order but
 
00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:26.200 align:start position:0%
executive order okay yes we were all
 
00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:29.320 align:start position:0%
familiar with those these days um
 
00:25:34.029 --> 00:25:34.039 align:start position:0%
the uh you know the leap between between
 
00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
that versus what this implies which is
 
00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:38.720 align:start position:0%
that somehow that is going to restrict
 
00:25:41.389 --> 00:25:41.399 align:start position:0%
this is an individual right not a sort
 
00:25:43.149 --> 00:25:43.159 align:start position:0%
of collective right it doesn't sort of
 
00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:45.480 align:start position:0%
say how this would be you know
 
00:25:47.789 --> 00:25:47.799 align:start position:0%
prosecuted or enforced so I guess that
 
00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:50.120 align:start position:0%
is not to belabor this but you know how
 
00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
do you make the leap between a reporting
 
00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
requirement to you know discriminatory
 
00:25:58.590 --> 00:25:58.600 align:start position:0%
prevention of access to computer systems
 
00:26:01.269 --> 00:26:01.279 align:start position:0%
um the gun owner and me would say if I
 
00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:02.720 align:start position:0%
had to register my guns with the
 
00:26:04.669 --> 00:26:04.679 align:start position:0%
government I'd probably have a problem
 
00:26:06.549 --> 00:26:06.559 align:start position:0%
with that right so it's sort of a
 
00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:09.480 align:start position:0%
similar or if I was if I had a a
 
00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
printing press and I had to register
 
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
that printing press with the government
 
00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
I'd have a similar reaction right like
 
00:26:20.029 --> 00:26:20.039 align:start position:0%
you know it's a you know it may not be
 
00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:22.520 align:start position:0%
overly burdensome but it's still an an
 
00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
invasion of my right by having to report
 
00:26:28.389 --> 00:26:28.399 align:start position:0%
on myself to the government right that
 
00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:31.480 align:start position:0%
that's kind of my gut gut reaction to
 
00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:34.840 align:start position:0%
that any other questions seeing none
 
00:26:38.149 --> 00:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:54.200 align:start position:0%
Scott thank you Mr chair and members of
 
00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:55.720 align:start position:0%
the committee for the opportunity to
 
00:26:58.269 --> 00:26:58.279 align:start position:0%
testify here today uh my name is Sarah
 
00:27:00.149 --> 00:27:00.159 align:start position:0%
Scott and I'm the deputy state director
 
00:27:02.269 --> 00:27:02.279 align:start position:0%
for Americans for Prosperity here in New
 
00:27:04.909 --> 00:27:04.919 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and on behalf of our activists
 
00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
across the state we are here in support
 
00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:09.480 align:start position:0%
of this legislation which seeks to
 
00:27:11.669 --> 00:27:11.679 align:start position:0%
enshrine the right to compute in the
 
00:27:14.389 --> 00:27:14.399 align:start position:0%
state's Constitution so we support this
 
00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
amendment because we believe in the
 
00:27:18.389 --> 00:27:18.399 align:start position:0%
transformative capability of artificial
 
00:27:21.029 --> 00:27:21.039 align:start position:0%
intelligence and emerging Technologies
 
00:27:23.269 --> 00:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
we believe that technology can meet its
 
00:27:25.389 --> 00:27:25.399 align:start position:0%
fullest potential when the government is
 
00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:27.640 align:start position:0%
doing its part to get out of the way and
 
00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
not emerging Technologies in red tape
 
00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
innovation in Computing art artificial
 
00:27:36.909 --> 00:27:36.919 align:start position:0%
intelligence and digital Technologies is
 
00:27:39.549 --> 00:27:39.559 align:start position:0%
advancing rapidly yet there's a growing
 
00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
concern that overregulation could limit
 
00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
access to computational resources stifle
 
00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:47.240 align:start position:0%
Innovation and restrict individual
 
00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:49.720 align:start position:0%
autonomy in the digital space some
 
00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:51.720 align:start position:0%
policy makers across the country are
 
00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:53.960 align:start position:0%
seeking to impose sweeping restrictions
 
00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
on Computing tools which could hinder
 
00:27:58.269 --> 00:27:58.279 align:start position:0%
economic growth personal freedoms
 
00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:00.320 align:start position:0%
Competitive Edge in technology
 
00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
businesses are watching the landscape
 
00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:04.200 align:start position:0%
very closely right now and Tech firms
 
00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:06.200 align:start position:0%
need predictability in the laws that
 
00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
govern their industry a constitutional
 
00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:10.600 align:start position:0%
amendment provides the highest level of
 
00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
protection ensuring these companies and
 
00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:14.720 align:start position:0%
individuals won't face sudden
 
00:28:16.549 --> 00:28:16.559 align:start position:0%
restrictive legislation that forces them
 
00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
to leave the
 
00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
state in an increasingly Digital World
 
00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:23.240 align:start position:0%
access to and the ability to utilize
 
00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
Computing resources are no longer
 
00:28:27.509 --> 00:28:27.519 align:start position:0%
luxuries but necessities and this
 
00:28:29.789 --> 00:28:29.799 align:start position:0%
constitutional Amendment recognizes that
 
00:28:32.509 --> 00:28:32.519 align:start position:0%
the basic access to computation is
 
00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:34.840 align:start position:0%
essential for participation in modern
 
00:28:38.669 --> 00:28:38.679 align:start position:0%
society from education to employment uh
 
00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
to Civic engagement and communication
 
00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
similar to how we protect the rights to
 
00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:46.360 align:start position:0%
free speech and assembly we must also
 
00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:48.760 align:start position:0%
protect the right to compute and ensure
 
00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:51.320 align:start position:0%
that all individuals have access to
 
00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:53.360 align:start position:0%
utilize the digital tools they need to
 
00:28:55.789 --> 00:28:55.799 align:start position:0%
thrive uh this amendment is really just
 
00:28:58.430 --> 00:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
focused on affirming the fundament Al
 
00:29:00.549 --> 00:29:00.559 align:start position:0%
principle that individuals should not be
 
00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:02.440 align:start position:0%
arbitrarily denied access to
 
00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:05.360 align:start position:0%
computational resources necessary for
 
00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:07.960 align:start position:0%
full participation in the 21st century
 
00:29:09.669 --> 00:29:09.679 align:start position:0%
so it's for these reasons that we ask
 
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
you to support this amendment happy to
 
00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
take questions representative foran um I
 
00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:18.200 align:start position:0%
apologize I was uh taking a phone call
 
00:29:20.549 --> 00:29:20.559 align:start position:0%
when you you started so what is your
 
00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:22.200 align:start position:0%
name what's the name of the organization
 
00:29:24.029 --> 00:29:24.039 align:start position:0%
you're representing and who is that
 
00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
organization again uh my name is Sarah
 
00:29:28.269 --> 00:29:28.279 align:start position:0%
Scott and I'm with Americans for
 
00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
Prosperity America for Prosperity okay
 
00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:32.600 align:start position:0%
yes I'm familiar with them so I know
 
00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
where they're okay I get it thanks
 
00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:37.240 align:start position:0%
representative trip thank you thank you
 
00:29:41.310 --> 00:29:41.320 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh since this is
 
00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:44.840 align:start position:0%
going to uh become a Right does that
 
00:29:47.269 --> 00:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
mean that the uh like the state of New
 
00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has to
 
00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:53.320 align:start position:0%
provide uh the internet access the uh
 
00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
the uh computers the uh whatever
 
00:29:58.950 --> 00:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
whatever else is needed for computation
 
00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:01.320 align:start position:0%
I would view this as similar to some of
 
00:30:03.549 --> 00:30:03.559 align:start position:0%
the things that uh representative Ammon
 
00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
brought up like the first amendment for
 
00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:07.880 align:start position:0%
example we tell people they have a First
 
00:30:09.549 --> 00:30:09.559 align:start position:0%
Amendment right we don't tell them that
 
00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
they have a right to access that um same
 
00:30:14.669 --> 00:30:14.679 align:start position:0%
with the Second Amendment uh I can't
 
00:30:16.389 --> 00:30:16.399 align:start position:0%
walk into the store and say because I
 
00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
have a Second Amendment right you have
 
00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:20.320 align:start position:0%
to give me the gun for free um so I view
 
00:30:23.269 --> 00:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
this uh in a similar
 
00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
manner thank you representative
 
00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
McFarland thank you Mr chairman um and
 
00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:31.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony so I I
 
00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:33.240 align:start position:0%
think in a similar fashion to my
 
00:30:36.029 --> 00:30:36.039 align:start position:0%
question to representative Ammon I would
 
00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:38.480 align:start position:0%
ask you in your
 
00:30:40.669 --> 00:30:40.679 align:start position:0%
organization do you believe that the
 
00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
language of this proposed constitutional
 
00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
amendment is sufficiently Broad and do
 
00:30:48.149 --> 00:30:48.159 align:start position:0%
you think it would help or hurt this
 
00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:50.840 align:start position:0%
legislation to be more explicit around
 
00:30:53.389 --> 00:30:53.399 align:start position:0%
encryption so I think uh thank you for
 
00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
the question and I think that when
 
00:30:58.549 --> 00:30:58.559 align:start position:0%
you're looking at encryption that's
 
00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:00.440 align:start position:0%
obviously a very complicated issue I
 
00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
think it's important to address it and I
 
00:31:04.629 --> 00:31:04.639 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be opposed to adding it to this
 
00:31:08.269 --> 00:31:08.279 align:start position:0%
legislation but I think that um when an
 
00:31:09.789 --> 00:31:09.799 align:start position:0%
issue especially a constitutional
 
00:31:13.070 --> 00:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
amendment becomes too complicated and
 
00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
technology is moving so quickly right
 
00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
now that it's increasingly difficult to
 
00:31:18.509 --> 00:31:18.519 align:start position:0%
keep up and that's for those of us that
 
00:31:20.389 --> 00:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
are paying attention so when you look at
 
00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:23.080 align:start position:0%
the average voter I don't know that
 
00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:25.480 align:start position:0%
they'll have sufficient understanding to
 
00:31:27.669 --> 00:31:27.679 align:start position:0%
incorporate that into this language but
 
00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
I do think that it's important to
 
00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
address so I wouldn't be opposed to it
 
00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:31.990 align:start position:0%
address so I wouldn't be opposed to it
either

00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
either
 
00:31:35.669 --> 00:31:35.679 align:start position:0%
followup that being the case if we
 
00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
contemplate that this goes forward more
 
00:31:39.509 --> 00:31:39.519 align:start position:0%
or less as
 
00:31:43.269 --> 00:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
written and you hypothetically Envision
 
00:31:46.269 --> 00:31:46.279 align:start position:0%
this being enacted into our
 
00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:48.440 align:start position:0%
Constitution and then contemplated by
 
00:31:52.029 --> 00:31:52.039 align:start position:0%
the courts we've seen
 
00:31:54.789 --> 00:31:54.799 align:start position:0%
fairly coercive and stringent regulation
 
00:31:57.149 --> 00:31:57.159 align:start position:0%
on other constitutional rights quote
 
00:31:57.159 --> 00:31:59.029 align:start position:0%
on other constitutional rights quote
unquote

00:31:59.029 --> 00:31:59.039 align:start position:0%
unquote
 
00:32:02.269 --> 00:32:02.279 align:start position:0%
how do you perceive that we might better
 
00:32:04.509 --> 00:32:04.519 align:start position:0%
protect this right if we were to enact
 
00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:07.480 align:start position:0%
it uh just to clarify protect the right
 
00:32:09.909 --> 00:32:09.919 align:start position:0%
for computation ortion the general right
 
00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
to compute uh I think as you've seen
 
00:32:15.269 --> 00:32:15.279 align:start position:0%
with um when we passed the
 
00:32:16.990 --> 00:32:17.000 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment a few years ago
 
00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:19.880 align:start position:0%
on digital privacy um the right to
 
00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:22.360 align:start position:0%
privacy we've seen court cases and
 
00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
legislation now being proposed to really
 
00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
solidify that right so I would Envision
 
00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
probably a similar scenario um
 
00:32:31.509 --> 00:32:31.519 align:start position:0%
especially with
 
00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
computation what is happening today is
 
00:32:35.549 --> 00:32:35.559 align:start position:0%
going to be very different than what's
 
00:32:38.389 --> 00:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
happening um 6 months to a year from now
 
00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
and so I don't think we can accurately
 
00:32:44.110 --> 00:32:44.120 align:start position:0%
predict the extent to which where the
 
00:32:45.629 --> 00:32:45.639 align:start position:0%
industry is going to move so I think
 
00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
there will be further legislation that
 
00:32:48.269 --> 00:32:48.279 align:start position:0%
will likely be
 
00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:51.480 align:start position:0%
needed but I think what this amendment
 
00:32:53.269 --> 00:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
does is really
 
00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:57.240 align:start position:0%
solidify the idea that in New Hampshire
 
00:33:00.269 --> 00:33:00.279 align:start position:0%
we're a state that you can come in and
 
00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:01.960 align:start position:0%
we're willing to work with you to figure
 
00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
out how to best allow you to pursue in
 
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
this technology um I think that this
 
00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:10.760 align:start position:0%
really sets us apart as the beacon for
 
00:33:13.269 --> 00:33:13.279 align:start position:0%
the movement overall um there are other
 
00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:14.600 align:start position:0%
states that are looking at similar
 
00:33:16.549 --> 00:33:16.559 align:start position:0%
legislation to this this year there are
 
00:33:18.029 --> 00:33:18.039 align:start position:0%
also states that are looking at
 
00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
regulating it and so I think that New
 
00:33:23.269 --> 00:33:23.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has been at the Forefront of a
 
00:33:25.549 --> 00:33:25.559 align:start position:0%
lot of these uh arguments in the past
 
00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
and I think continuing to solidify our
 
00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:28.549 align:start position:0%
and I think continuing to solidify our
position

00:33:28.549 --> 00:33:28.559 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
as a state that is welcoming to the
 
00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
industry would be a huge benefit to the
 
00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
economy here as well thank you any other
 
00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
questions representative Manos thank you
 
00:33:41.789 --> 00:33:41.799 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:33:45.389 --> 00:33:45.399 align:start position:0%
question um I don't remember the the
 
00:33:48.549 --> 00:33:48.559 align:start position:0%
term for it but the concept that for
 
00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
example um Comcast or Xfinity can slow
 
00:33:57.430 --> 00:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
down your internet connection to be able
 
00:33:59.950 --> 00:33:59.960 align:start position:0%
to accommodate traffic or for whatever
 
00:34:03.549 --> 00:34:03.559 align:start position:0%
purpose they're doing that um it seems
 
00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:06.200 align:start position:0%
to me that as I read this uh proposed
 
00:34:08.149 --> 00:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment it would
 
00:34:10.990 --> 00:34:11.000 align:start position:0%
prohibit that and I'm just wondering
 
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
whether you have a view on that thank
 
00:34:16.629 --> 00:34:16.639 align:start position:0%
you for the question I admittedly do not
 
00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:19.720 align:start position:0%
know enough about how I know Xfinity
 
00:34:21.869 --> 00:34:21.879 align:start position:0%
does it because I experience it but I
 
00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
don't know enough about the legalities
 
00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
around that situation to really speak to
 
00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:29.240 align:start position:0%
it with this but I can uh try to get an
 
00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:32.560 align:start position:0%
answer from somebody who would speak to
 
00:34:36.109 --> 00:34:36.119 align:start position:0%
that you any other questions seeing none
 
00:34:36.119 --> 00:34:37.030 align:start position:0%
that you any other questions seeing none
thank

00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:34:39.389 --> 00:34:39.399 align:start position:0%
you that's the last pink card I have for
 
00:34:41.470 --> 00:34:41.480 align:start position:0%
this bill is there anyone else here that
 
00:34:43.109 --> 00:34:43.119 align:start position:0%
wishes to speak on
 
00:34:45.669 --> 00:34:45.679 align:start position:0%
it seeing none I'll close the hearing on
 
00:34:45.679 --> 00:34:46.950 align:start position:0%
it seeing none I'll close the hearing on

00:46:13.150 --> 00:46:13.160 align:start position:0%
it's officially 10:15 I'm going to open
 
00:46:16.270 --> 00:46:16.280 align:start position:0%
the hearing on House Bill 615 and
 
00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
recognize the prime sponsor
 
00:46:19.829 --> 00:46:19.839 align:start position:0%
representative Dan Maguire thank you Mr
 
00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
chairman and members of the committee um
 
00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
I lost my voice the other day from the
 
00:46:27.829 --> 00:46:27.839 align:start position:0%
political problem of speaking to much so
 
00:46:31.109 --> 00:46:31.119 align:start position:0%
I'm going to try to be brief um this
 
00:46:34.309 --> 00:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
bill is a fairly substantial rewrite of
 
00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
RSA 318b colon 17b otherwise known as
 
00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
forfeiture of items used in connection
 
00:46:43.230 --> 00:46:43.240 align:start position:0%
with drug
 
00:46:46.150 --> 00:46:46.160 align:start position:0%
offenses um I apologize for the length
 
00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
of the bill part of it is just this
 
00:46:51.069 --> 00:46:51.079 align:start position:0%
whole section is is lengthy and part of
 
00:46:54.030 --> 00:46:54.040 align:start position:0%
it is that um this is all about
 
00:46:56.910 --> 00:46:56.920 align:start position:0%
courtroom procedure and in our
 
00:47:00.549 --> 00:47:00.559 align:start position:0%
discussions with the Judiciary they like
 
00:47:03.630 --> 00:47:03.640 align:start position:0%
length they they they like a lot of
 
00:47:07.549 --> 00:47:07.559 align:start position:0%
specificity and um so that kind of has
 
00:47:10.549 --> 00:47:10.559 align:start position:0%
um made its way into the bill the goal
 
00:47:14.150 --> 00:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
of the bill is twofold one is sort of
 
00:47:16.549 --> 00:47:16.559 align:start position:0%
Greater fairness in these kind of cases
 
00:47:18.990 --> 00:47:19.000 align:start position:0%
and I'll describe what that these cases
 
00:47:23.150 --> 00:47:23.160 align:start position:0%
are but also efficiency in the courtroom
 
00:47:27.430 --> 00:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
process so um what these cases are are
 
00:47:29.630 --> 00:47:29.640 align:start position:0%
is that they they deal with the
 
00:47:34.349 --> 00:47:34.359 align:start position:0%
situation where someone is arrested for
 
00:47:37.470 --> 00:47:37.480 align:start position:0%
um possession or sale of
 
00:47:42.109 --> 00:47:42.119 align:start position:0%
drugs and um and property is seized
 
00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:47.200 align:start position:0%
along with the drugs and um and that
 
00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
property is can be forfeit if it's used
 
00:47:54.790 --> 00:47:54.800 align:start position:0%
in connection with with selling drugs so
 
00:47:56.589 --> 00:47:56.599 align:start position:0%
for example somebody's selling drugs out
 
00:48:00.990 --> 00:48:01.000 align:start position:0%
of their car the car can be forfeited um
 
00:48:04.430 --> 00:48:04.440 align:start position:0%
as kind of an instrument of of the
 
00:48:08.549 --> 00:48:08.559 align:start position:0%
crime um more typically it's that's one
 
00:48:11.829 --> 00:48:11.839 align:start position:0%
typical example but also um somebody's
 
00:48:14.069 --> 00:48:14.079 align:start position:0%
arrested and and next to them is the
 
00:48:16.990 --> 00:48:17.000 align:start position:0%
drugs and a bag of cash right so the
 
00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
cash is often forfeited as kind of the
 
00:48:24.549 --> 00:48:24.559 align:start position:0%
fruits of the crime and so this um this
 
00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
section of law deals with um how those
 
00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
court cases go and um sort of
 
00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
traditionally or or the way it's written
 
00:48:38.069 --> 00:48:38.079 align:start position:0%
now the there's there's almost a
 
00:48:41.950 --> 00:48:41.960 align:start position:0%
separate case involving the property
 
00:48:45.150 --> 00:48:45.160 align:start position:0%
than the case involving the crime so the
 
00:48:49.549 --> 00:48:49.559 align:start position:0%
the criminal case um is currently it's
 
00:48:53.390 --> 00:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
prosecuted typically in Superior Court
 
00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
um you get a criminal defense attorney
 
00:48:58.589 --> 00:48:58.599 align:start position:0%
when you're accused of such a crime and
 
00:49:01.829 --> 00:49:01.839 align:start position:0%
so on um but the but the case against
 
00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:06.160 align:start position:0%
the property is only a civil case and
 
00:49:08.270 --> 00:49:08.280 align:start position:0%
it's it's prosecuted by the Attorney
 
00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
General's office so so often these uh
 
00:49:13.390 --> 00:49:13.400 align:start position:0%
criminal cases are prosecuted by the
 
00:49:15.750 --> 00:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
County prosecutor or in case of
 
00:49:18.309 --> 00:49:18.319 align:start position:0%
Manchester City prosecutor that kind of
 
00:49:21.990 --> 00:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
thing um and and the the case against
 
00:49:24.390 --> 00:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
the property against the bag of cash or
 
00:49:27.789 --> 00:49:27.799 align:start position:0%
the whatever is is a separate case
 
00:49:30.670 --> 00:49:30.680 align:start position:0%
prosecuted by the Attorney General now
 
00:49:34.870 --> 00:49:34.880 align:start position:0%
we do already have in law that that the
 
00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
property is not subject to forfeiture if
 
00:49:41.309 --> 00:49:41.319 align:start position:0%
the person is not convicted of the crime
 
00:49:43.390 --> 00:49:43.400 align:start position:0%
but the problem is because these are
 
00:49:45.589 --> 00:49:45.599 align:start position:0%
separate cases and separate courts
 
00:49:48.750 --> 00:49:48.760 align:start position:0%
different judges often uh different
 
00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
prosecutors and and no criminal uh no no
 
00:49:55.710 --> 00:49:55.720 align:start position:0%
defense attorney provided for Indigent
 
00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:57.470 align:start position:0%
defense attorney provided for Indigent
defendants

00:49:57.470 --> 00:49:57.480 align:start position:0%
defendants
 
00:49:57.480 --> 00:49:58.829 align:start position:0%
defendants
um

00:49:58.829 --> 00:49:58.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
essentially most of the time these cases
 
00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
are just um there's no contest right
 
00:50:08.549 --> 00:50:08.559 align:start position:0%
they're they're they're um uh just
 
00:50:11.069 --> 00:50:11.079 align:start position:0%
decided by default right so so the
 
00:50:14.510 --> 00:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
person um doesn't bother to put up a
 
00:50:17.390 --> 00:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
defense of their property obviously they
 
00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
have the the normal criminal defense of
 
00:50:23.710 --> 00:50:23.720 align:start position:0%
themselves um and so what this bill does
 
00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
is it merges the whole procedure so that
 
00:50:29.710 --> 00:50:29.720 align:start position:0%
it effectively becomes a single uh
 
00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
procedure and and the criminal case
 
00:50:36.309 --> 00:50:36.319 align:start position:0%
would tend to go forward first and then
 
00:50:39.390 --> 00:50:39.400 align:start position:0%
and then the the uh action against the
 
00:50:42.510 --> 00:50:42.520 align:start position:0%
property would happen at the end uh
 
00:50:45.870 --> 00:50:45.880 align:start position:0%
typically and and be kind of a just part
 
00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
of the penalty part of the of the crime
 
00:50:50.910 --> 00:50:50.920 align:start position:0%
so assuming someone's convicted of the
 
00:50:54.309 --> 00:50:54.319 align:start position:0%
crime then the property would be could
 
00:50:56.950 --> 00:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
would be forfeit or you know and so so
 
00:51:00.270 --> 00:51:00.280 align:start position:0%
so it it the main thing is that the case
 
00:51:04.309 --> 00:51:04.319 align:start position:0%
would go into the exact same courtroom
 
00:51:06.510 --> 00:51:06.520 align:start position:0%
with the same prosecutor with the same
 
00:51:09.030 --> 00:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
defense attorney it would everybody
 
00:51:12.309 --> 00:51:12.319 align:start position:0%
would be on on the same page basically
 
00:51:15.190 --> 00:51:15.200 align:start position:0%
and um so that's the efficiency part
 
00:51:17.829 --> 00:51:17.839 align:start position:0%
right so so you don't have to have two
 
00:51:20.190 --> 00:51:20.200 align:start position:0%
cases two judges and and all that kind
 
00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
of thing and we uh look at it as um this
 
00:51:27.630 --> 00:51:27.640 align:start position:0%
would be the the the about the property
 
00:51:29.630 --> 00:51:29.640 align:start position:0%
would just be a very minor sort of thing
 
00:51:30.549 --> 00:51:30.559 align:start position:0%
at the
 
00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
end now as far as fairness goes um there
 
00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:37.270 align:start position:0%
end now as far as fairness goes um there
that's

00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
also um having that better procedure
 
00:51:45.349 --> 00:51:45.359 align:start position:0%
creates more fairness because um the
 
00:51:49.510 --> 00:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
defense attorney who would be there to
 
00:51:52.990 --> 00:51:53.000 align:start position:0%
defend the property as well as defending
 
00:51:57.630 --> 00:51:57.640 align:start position:0%
the um the person accused of the crime
 
00:51:59.829 --> 00:51:59.839 align:start position:0%
and it and so there would be many fewer
 
00:52:02.990 --> 00:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
defaults it would simply it would be um
 
00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
the case that that um the property the
 
00:52:09.349 --> 00:52:09.359 align:start position:0%
property aspect would be held off till
 
00:52:12.789 --> 00:52:12.799 align:start position:0%
later the criminal aspect would go first
 
00:52:14.950 --> 00:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
assuming someone is if someone found
 
00:52:16.990 --> 00:52:17.000 align:start position:0%
innocent of the crime that would be the
 
00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:20.720 align:start position:0%
end of it if someone's found guilty um
 
00:52:22.470 --> 00:52:22.480 align:start position:0%
then that attorney would be there for
 
00:52:24.549 --> 00:52:24.559 align:start position:0%
another few minutes dealing with the
 
00:52:26.950 --> 00:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
dealing with the property thing but but
 
00:52:29.109 --> 00:52:29.119 align:start position:0%
there wouldn't be defaults which are
 
00:52:32.349 --> 00:52:32.359 align:start position:0%
basically unfair the bill also does a
 
00:52:35.349 --> 00:52:35.359 align:start position:0%
little bit in terms of um putting in
 
00:52:39.789 --> 00:52:39.799 align:start position:0%
minimums of property um so if it's if
 
00:52:42.069 --> 00:52:42.079 align:start position:0%
it's currency the bill puts in a minimum
 
00:52:42.079 --> 00:52:43.309 align:start position:0%
it's currency the bill puts in a minimum
of

00:52:43.309 --> 00:52:43.319 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:52:47.789 --> 00:52:47.799 align:start position:0%
$1,000 um and and a vehicle of $5,000
 
00:52:51.430 --> 00:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
value so you won't be seizing and trying
 
00:52:55.109 --> 00:52:55.119 align:start position:0%
to sell cheap really
 
00:52:56.950 --> 00:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
um stuff
 
00:52:59.750 --> 00:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
the property that's that's not worth
 
00:53:02.630 --> 00:53:02.640 align:start position:0%
much basically and
 
00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
um it
 
00:53:10.349 --> 00:53:10.359 align:start position:0%
also um increases fairness for uh for
 
00:53:13.829 --> 00:53:13.839 align:start position:0%
innocent owners so what can often happen
 
00:53:17.829 --> 00:53:17.839 align:start position:0%
is um you borrow somebody else's car you
 
00:53:19.950 --> 00:53:19.960 align:start position:0%
borrow your mother's car you borrow your
 
00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:22.480 align:start position:0%
your wife's car or something like that
 
00:53:23.910 --> 00:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
and you say I'm going to the grocery
 
00:53:26.109 --> 00:53:26.119 align:start position:0%
store and then you're arrested in the
 
00:53:28.430 --> 00:53:28.440 align:start position:0%
parking lot selling drugs or something
 
00:53:32.589 --> 00:53:32.599 align:start position:0%
like that so so the bill has ways for
 
00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
the innocent owner who didn't realized
 
00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
that their car was going to be used in
 
00:53:40.109 --> 00:53:40.119 align:start position:0%
that way to get their property back in a
 
00:53:44.910 --> 00:53:44.920 align:start position:0%
in a more expedited way so um the other
 
00:53:47.190 --> 00:53:47.200 align:start position:0%
thing I handed out by the way so this
 
00:53:51.670 --> 00:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
Bill had previously gone um this this is
 
00:53:54.270 --> 00:53:54.280 align:start position:0%
a subject of legislation for long
 
00:53:57.710 --> 00:53:57.720 align:start position:0%
periods of time and um the one that we
 
00:54:00.270 --> 00:54:00.280 align:start position:0%
had two years ago uh went to the
 
00:54:02.430 --> 00:54:02.440 align:start position:0%
criminal justice committee they turned
 
00:54:06.309 --> 00:54:06.319 align:start position:0%
it into a study I handed you out the um
 
00:54:10.430 --> 00:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
results of that study um the bill has
 
00:54:13.270 --> 00:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
changed a little but the main things is
 
00:54:15.510 --> 00:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
we we remove from that particular
 
00:54:18.549 --> 00:54:18.559 align:start position:0%
version of the bill um the things that
 
00:54:21.990 --> 00:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
were most objectionable to law
 
00:54:25.349 --> 00:54:25.359 align:start position:0%
enforcement and we made it so that
 
00:54:28.950 --> 00:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
what's left is all courtroom procedure
 
00:54:31.230 --> 00:54:31.240 align:start position:0%
so this has the bill doesn't change
 
00:54:34.589 --> 00:54:34.599 align:start position:0%
anything to do with what gets seized how
 
00:54:37.309 --> 00:54:37.319 align:start position:0%
it gets seized anything to do with law
 
00:54:40.069 --> 00:54:40.079 align:start position:0%
enforcement um what happens to the funds
 
00:54:43.589 --> 00:54:43.599 align:start position:0%
that result um all that sort of stuff is
 
00:54:47.309 --> 00:54:47.319 align:start position:0%
is unchanged from current law um the the
 
00:54:50.750 --> 00:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
bill itself is all about what happens in
 
00:54:54.150 --> 00:54:54.160 align:start position:0%
court and I'm happy to take questions
 
00:54:56.030 --> 00:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
are there any questions representative
 
00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:58.710 align:start position:0%
are there any questions representative
Smith

00:54:58.710 --> 00:54:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:01.349 --> 00:55:01.359 align:start position:0%
thank you good morning
 
00:55:05.470 --> 00:55:05.480 align:start position:0%
um in a case in which the accused is
 
00:55:09.069 --> 00:55:09.079 align:start position:0%
represented by the public
 
00:55:11.549 --> 00:55:11.559 align:start position:0%
defender it's a criminal
 
00:55:15.190 --> 00:55:15.200 align:start position:0%
case would under current law and
 
00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
practice the public defender
 
00:55:20.470 --> 00:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
also be
 
00:55:24.069 --> 00:55:24.079 align:start position:0%
permitted to represent the
 
00:55:27.230 --> 00:55:27.240 align:start position:0%
accused in the issues related
 
00:55:31.190 --> 00:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
to forfeiture rather than the original
 
00:55:32.950 --> 00:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
crime yes thank you for the question
 
00:55:34.910 --> 00:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
representative I'm pretty sure the
 
00:55:38.270 --> 00:55:38.280 align:start position:0%
answer is no that that the the public
 
00:55:45.230 --> 00:55:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:47.789 --> 00:55:47.799 align:start position:0%
cases representative
 
00:55:51.630 --> 00:55:51.640 align:start position:0%
Manos I was thank you for um taking my
 
00:55:53.270 --> 00:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
question I was going to ask the same
 
00:55:55.190 --> 00:55:55.200 align:start position:0%
question that representative Smith asked
 
00:55:57.750 --> 00:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
but I'll just broaden it a little bit an
 
00:56:00.670 --> 00:56:00.680 align:start position:0%
Indigent defendant has a constitutional
 
00:56:04.029 --> 00:56:04.039 align:start position:0%
right to counil in a criminal case the
 
00:56:06.829 --> 00:56:06.839 align:start position:0%
Indigent defendant does not or I'll ask
 
00:56:09.589 --> 00:56:09.599 align:start position:0%
it as a question does the Indigent
 
00:56:13.710 --> 00:56:13.720 align:start position:0%
defendant um in the Civil for fure case
 
00:56:15.789 --> 00:56:15.799 align:start position:0%
have either a constitutional or a
 
00:56:18.789 --> 00:56:18.799 align:start position:0%
statutory right to the appointment of
 
00:56:21.190 --> 00:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
councel so thank you for the question
 
00:56:23.710 --> 00:56:23.720 align:start position:0%
but you know realizing I am not an
 
00:56:26.470 --> 00:56:26.480 align:start position:0%
attorney myself right but but my
 
00:56:27.630 --> 00:56:27.640 align:start position:0%
understanding of it you know having
 
00:56:28.910 --> 00:56:28.920 align:start position:0%
dealt with this for a long period of
 
00:56:31.349 --> 00:56:31.359 align:start position:0%
time is that the answer is no that you
 
00:56:34.549 --> 00:56:34.559 align:start position:0%
only have a right to attorney if it's a
 
00:56:38.230 --> 00:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
criminal case not if it's a civil case
 
00:56:40.789 --> 00:56:40.799 align:start position:0%
and that's one of the problems I mean
 
00:56:42.710 --> 00:56:42.720 align:start position:0%
that's that's one of the most serious
 
00:56:45.309 --> 00:56:45.319 align:start position:0%
problems that this bill is trying to
 
00:56:48.430 --> 00:56:48.440 align:start position:0%
address because in my mind it's not
 
00:56:50.589 --> 00:56:50.599 align:start position:0%
really a civil case the way we wrote
 
00:56:53.430 --> 00:56:53.440 align:start position:0%
this bill by the way originally was to
 
00:56:56.470 --> 00:56:56.480 align:start position:0%
make the entire procedure a criminal
 
00:56:59.069 --> 00:56:59.079 align:start position:0%
case and and make the forfeiture just
 
00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
part of the penalty of the criminal case
 
00:57:03.870 --> 00:57:03.880 align:start position:0%
so one case instead of two the problem
 
00:57:07.549 --> 00:57:07.559 align:start position:0%
is we met with the Judiciary at length
 
00:57:09.349 --> 00:57:09.359 align:start position:0%
and their computer
 
00:57:11.710 --> 00:57:11.720 align:start position:0%
system couldn't handle that it would
 
00:57:13.150 --> 00:57:13.160 align:start position:0%
would have cost
 
00:57:16.349 --> 00:57:16.359 align:start position:0%
them a fair amount of money to to make
 
00:57:18.710 --> 00:57:18.720 align:start position:0%
the changes to their computer system to
 
00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
make that work so we we ended up sort of
 
00:57:23.109 --> 00:57:23.119 align:start position:0%
keeping the two
 
00:57:26.510 --> 00:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
cases um but they worked out a way of
 
00:57:28.630 --> 00:57:28.640 align:start position:0%
sort of linking those two cases so
 
00:57:31.829 --> 00:57:31.839 align:start position:0%
there'll still be a civil case but it'll
 
00:57:34.990 --> 00:57:35.000 align:start position:0%
have sort of different
 
00:57:38.510 --> 00:57:38.520 align:start position:0%
um different U uh burdens of proof and
 
00:57:39.910 --> 00:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
things like that that all those kind of
 
00:57:42.349 --> 00:57:42.359 align:start position:0%
details are in the Bill but there'll be
 
00:57:45.069 --> 00:57:45.079 align:start position:0%
those cases are linked and it it's it's
 
00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
um sort of helped the
 
00:57:51.470 --> 00:57:51.480 align:start position:0%
Judiciary be able to to deal with this
 
00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
to actually make it more efficient for
 
00:57:55.549 --> 00:57:55.559 align:start position:0%
them without any cost right without any
 
00:57:57.309 --> 00:57:57.319 align:start position:0%
serious cost to
 
00:58:00.990 --> 00:58:01.000 align:start position:0%
them follow up so there would be an
 
00:58:04.750 --> 00:58:04.760 align:start position:0%
additional cost to the state for the
 
00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
public defender or councel to represent
 
00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:08.470 align:start position:0%
public defender or councel to represent
the

00:58:08.470 --> 00:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
Indigent uh defendant in both cases
 
00:58:17.630 --> 00:58:17.640 align:start position:0%
correct yes so yes but so in my opinion
 
00:58:19.910 --> 00:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
um we're talking about two more minutes
 
00:58:21.870 --> 00:58:21.880 align:start position:0%
or something like that right I mean you
 
00:58:24.349 --> 00:58:24.359 align:start position:0%
get to the end of the criminal case and
 
00:58:26.750 --> 00:58:26.760 align:start position:0%
you say okay he's guilty uh what's
 
00:58:29.390 --> 00:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
happening to the property uh it's going
 
00:58:30.950 --> 00:58:30.960 align:start position:0%
to be forfeited you know what I mean
 
00:58:33.829 --> 00:58:33.839 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's a very short thing it's
 
00:58:36.309 --> 00:58:36.319 align:start position:0%
not like it's a completely separate case
 
00:58:39.829 --> 00:58:39.839 align:start position:0%
situation and and all that sort of stuff
 
00:58:46.510 --> 00:58:46.520 align:start position:0%
um but it's also in less State um um
 
00:58:48.670 --> 00:58:48.680 align:start position:0%
expense because right
 
00:58:51.270 --> 00:58:51.280 align:start position:0%
now there's there are people at the
 
00:58:53.670 --> 00:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office who all they
 
00:58:57.950 --> 00:58:57.960 align:start position:0%
do is these kind of um civil cases right
 
00:59:01.710 --> 00:59:01.720 align:start position:0%
so all they do is this whereas if you if
 
00:59:04.150 --> 00:59:04.160 align:start position:0%
you combine it with the criminal case
 
00:59:06.589 --> 00:59:06.599 align:start position:0%
the County Attorney again another two
 
00:59:09.910 --> 00:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
minutes can deal with both
 
00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
so representative uh
 
00:59:14.430 --> 00:59:14.440 align:start position:0%
Alexander thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my question my question was
 
00:59:18.910 --> 00:59:18.920 align:start position:0%
on your proposed amendment um the Third
 
00:59:23.309 --> 00:59:23.319 align:start position:0%
change uh is regarding um the somebody
 
00:59:25.109 --> 00:59:25.119 align:start position:0%
else who owns the property but it's used
 
00:59:26.670 --> 00:59:26.680 align:start position:0%
in a crime
 
00:59:31.309 --> 00:59:31.319 align:start position:0%
um the language of actual knowledge is
 
00:59:32.990 --> 00:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
confusing for me I know you define it
 
00:59:35.230 --> 00:59:35.240 align:start position:0%
but I guess I'm wondering who has to
 
00:59:37.750 --> 00:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
prove that they had actual knowledge is
 
00:59:41.470 --> 00:59:41.480 align:start position:0%
it is it the the government or is it the
 
00:59:43.069 --> 00:59:43.079 align:start position:0%
individual has to prove that they did
 
00:59:45.109 --> 00:59:45.119 align:start position:0%
not have actual knowledge of the crime
 
00:59:46.630 --> 00:59:46.640 align:start position:0%
in order to get their property back I
 
00:59:48.309 --> 00:59:48.319 align:start position:0%
guess I'm wondering like who has that
 
00:59:50.430 --> 00:59:50.440 align:start position:0%
who bears that responsibility yes thank
 
00:59:54.109 --> 00:59:54.119 align:start position:0%
you for the question so um you brought
 
00:59:57.870 --> 00:59:57.880 align:start position:0%
up the amendment so uh let me just just
 
01:00:00.309 --> 01:00:00.319 align:start position:0%
give you some information about that so
 
01:00:03.750 --> 01:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
um rep your chairman representative Lynn
 
01:00:05.870 --> 01:00:05.880 align:start position:0%
um and uh other attorneys who were
 
01:00:08.069 --> 01:00:08.079 align:start position:0%
helping us with this legislation got
 
01:00:11.349 --> 01:00:11.359 align:start position:0%
together and and went through this bill
 
01:00:14.670 --> 01:00:14.680 align:start position:0%
in in a lot of detail and these were the
 
01:00:18.710 --> 01:00:18.720 align:start position:0%
changes that um representative Lynn
 
01:00:21.789 --> 01:00:21.799 align:start position:0%
liked and and we and we were happy with
 
01:00:26.230 --> 01:00:26.240 align:start position:0%
too to try to clarify stuff and um in
 
01:00:27.710 --> 01:00:27.720 align:start position:0%
this particular
 
01:00:31.589 --> 01:00:31.599 align:start position:0%
case um so the actual knowledge part is
 
01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
something that um the court the the
 
01:00:39.589 --> 01:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
um it's it's the
 
01:00:43.069 --> 01:00:43.079 align:start position:0%
knowledge they would have to prove about
 
01:00:45.430 --> 01:00:45.440 align:start position:0%
the the innocent owner the the owner of
 
01:00:47.309 --> 01:00:47.319 align:start position:0%
the property the owner of the car or
 
01:00:50.029 --> 01:00:50.039 align:start position:0%
whatever had knowledge that it was going
 
01:00:55.150 --> 01:00:55.160 align:start position:0%
to be used in the crime um but but the
 
01:00:59.630 --> 01:00:59.640 align:start position:0%
burden of proof for that is not um we
 
01:01:02.710 --> 01:01:02.720 align:start position:0%
think too difficult for them to um
 
01:01:05.430 --> 01:01:05.440 align:start position:0%
process and and there's an attorney here
 
01:01:07.510 --> 01:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
who will Who will talk to this kind of
 
01:01:11.390 --> 01:01:11.400 align:start position:0%
level of detail better than I can so yes
 
01:01:13.589 --> 01:01:13.599 align:start position:0%
thank you and I'm I'm going to defer my
 
01:01:14.950 --> 01:01:14.960 align:start position:0%
question to an attorney on who has the
 
01:01:17.029 --> 01:01:17.039 align:start position:0%
burden proof in that specific case thank
 
01:01:20.230 --> 01:01:20.240 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:01:22.029 --> 01:01:22.039 align:start position:0%
Smith thank
 
01:01:25.950 --> 01:01:25.960 align:start position:0%
you I'm becoming more and more confused
 
01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:28.440 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry about that no no it's my
 
01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:33.000 align:start position:0%
fault not yours um if I understood you
 
01:01:36.990 --> 01:01:37.000 align:start position:0%
correctly you were trying to combine the
 
01:01:40.589 --> 01:01:40.599 align:start position:0%
criminal and the in quote civil issues
 
01:01:44.109 --> 01:01:44.119 align:start position:0%
into one
 
01:01:44.119 --> 01:01:45.990 align:start position:0%
into one
case

01:01:45.990 --> 01:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
case
 
01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.109 align:start position:0%
case
yet

01:01:48.109 --> 01:01:48.119 align:start position:0%
yet
 
01:01:51.710 --> 01:01:51.720 align:start position:0%
the defendant the
 
01:01:56.349 --> 01:01:56.359 align:start position:0%
accused is to be permitted to have
 
01:02:00.589 --> 01:02:00.599 align:start position:0%
State appointed legal counsel only for
 
01:02:03.390 --> 01:02:03.400 align:start position:0%
the criminal not the
 
01:02:08.150 --> 01:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
civil and if I understood you the
 
01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
reason that you couldn't handle this in
 
01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:15.190 align:start position:0%
reason that you couldn't handle this in
a

01:02:15.190 --> 01:02:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:22.349 --> 01:02:22.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:25.309 --> 01:02:25.319 align:start position:0%
court claimed it did not have the money
 
01:02:25.319 --> 01:02:26.470 align:start position:0%
court claimed it did not have the money
to

01:02:26.470 --> 01:02:26.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
to help create a system that would be
 
01:02:33.589 --> 01:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
necessary am I missing something here so
 
01:02:35.069 --> 01:02:35.079 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question let me let me
 
01:02:38.789 --> 01:02:38.799 align:start position:0%
try to clarify so um the part about the
 
01:02:40.069 --> 01:02:40.079 align:start position:0%
court and the
 
01:02:43.870 --> 01:02:43.880 align:start position:0%
money I'm not inclin to spend money when
 
01:02:46.670 --> 01:02:46.680 align:start position:0%
it's not necessary right so we worked
 
01:02:50.230 --> 01:02:50.240 align:start position:0%
out with the court an acceptable version
 
01:02:52.990 --> 01:02:53.000 align:start position:0%
that didn't require spending money right
 
01:02:56.910 --> 01:02:56.920 align:start position:0%
so so um that's
 
01:03:01.230 --> 01:03:01.240 align:start position:0%
that the part about the attorney is the
 
01:03:05.269 --> 01:03:05.279 align:start position:0%
state could Pro can provide attorneys
 
01:03:09.470 --> 01:03:09.480 align:start position:0%
for Indigent defendants in civil cases
 
01:03:12.630 --> 01:03:12.640 align:start position:0%
if they wanted to right I mean but
 
01:03:14.870 --> 01:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
constitutionally we have to provide
 
01:03:18.549 --> 01:03:18.559 align:start position:0%
attorneys for people in criminal cases
 
01:03:19.470 --> 01:03:19.480 align:start position:0%
that are
 
01:03:22.430 --> 01:03:22.440 align:start position:0%
Indigent but but civil cases we may or
 
01:03:25.390 --> 01:03:25.400 align:start position:0%
may not it's up to us right just like
 
01:03:29.069 --> 01:03:29.079 align:start position:0%
any other kind of laws so so this bill
 
01:03:32.710 --> 01:03:32.720 align:start position:0%
says that in this particular little kind
 
01:03:36.069 --> 01:03:36.079 align:start position:0%
of of civil case the attorney will
 
01:03:38.109 --> 01:03:38.119 align:start position:0%
continue you know the attorney who's
 
01:03:40.069 --> 01:03:40.079 align:start position:0%
been provided for the Criminal part will
 
01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
continue on the Civil part if you see
 
01:03:44.430 --> 01:03:44.440 align:start position:0%
what I mean so this is sort of adding
 
01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
that but it's not something that's
 
01:03:50.430 --> 01:03:50.440 align:start position:0%
constitutionally required it's it's just
 
01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:57.950 --> 01:03:57.960 align:start position:0%
add representative McFarland thank you
 
01:04:01.870 --> 01:04:01.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um with regard to the
 
01:04:06.430 --> 01:04:06.440 align:start position:0%
language uh on uh line 23 of the
 
01:04:11.190 --> 01:04:11.200 align:start position:0%
bill that provides an exemption for
 
01:04:15.630 --> 01:04:15.640 align:start position:0%
lower value amounts of currency or
 
01:04:18.510 --> 01:04:18.520 align:start position:0%
Vehicles what what page is that uh page
 
01:04:24.430 --> 01:04:24.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:28.549 --> 01:04:28.559 align:start position:0%
23 I would be interested to understand
 
01:04:31.190 --> 01:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
first of all how you arrived at those
 
01:04:33.430 --> 01:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
numbers and second of all if you would
 
01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
agree with me that those numbers are
 
01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:35.829 align:start position:0%
agree with me that those numbers are
rather

01:04:35.829 --> 01:04:35.839 align:start position:0%
rather
 
01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
low yes thank you for the question so I
 
01:04:41.069 --> 01:04:41.079 align:start position:0%
believe that those are are sort of
 
01:04:41.079 --> 01:04:41.990 align:start position:0%
believe that those are are sort of
current

01:04:41.990 --> 01:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
current
 
01:04:45.910 --> 01:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
practice uh in this area by the um the
 
01:04:48.390 --> 01:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office so this is
 
01:04:52.470 --> 01:04:52.480 align:start position:0%
just making explicit in law um something
 
01:04:54.630 --> 01:04:54.640 align:start position:0%
that they're essentially already
 
01:04:57.789 --> 01:04:57.799 align:start position:0%
doing followup so if I understand
 
01:05:01.109 --> 01:05:01.119 align:start position:0%
correctly one of the premises for the
 
01:05:02.589 --> 01:05:02.599 align:start position:0%
the current practice of civil asset
 
01:05:05.109 --> 01:05:05.119 align:start position:0%
forfeiture in this state and in other
 
01:05:09.150 --> 01:05:09.160 align:start position:0%
states is to address things such as drug
 
01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
traffickers and others that are carrying
 
01:05:15.870 --> 01:05:15.880 align:start position:0%
excessive amounts of currency around uh
 
01:05:19.789 --> 01:05:19.799 align:start position:0%
that is entirely out with the normal
 
01:05:21.910 --> 01:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
circumstance whereas when I look at
 
01:05:25.670 --> 01:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
these numbers I can readily envisage a c
 
01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:28.480 align:start position:0%
cumstance where a tourist uh or a
 
01:05:31.269 --> 01:05:31.279 align:start position:0%
traveler May legitimately have well in
 
01:05:34.910 --> 01:05:34.920 align:start position:0%
excess of $1,000 on their person or in
 
01:05:38.150 --> 01:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
their vehicle and in their luggage and I
 
01:05:40.190 --> 01:05:40.200 align:start position:0%
was wondering whether you think it might
 
01:05:42.430 --> 01:05:42.440 align:start position:0%
be reasonable to amend the bill to
 
01:05:45.029 --> 01:05:45.039 align:start position:0%
reflect a more appropriate number in
 
01:05:47.630 --> 01:05:47.640 align:start position:0%
today's society yes thank you for the
 
01:05:49.230 --> 01:05:49.240 align:start position:0%
question but I think what you're
 
01:05:52.390 --> 01:05:52.400 align:start position:0%
thinking about is there are plenty of
 
01:05:54.510 --> 01:05:54.520 align:start position:0%
cases where when the these are just
 
01:05:57.069 --> 01:05:57.079 align:start position:0%
civil matters
 
01:05:57.079 --> 01:05:58.670 align:start position:0%
civil matters
um

01:05:58.670 --> 01:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:01.990 --> 01:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
unscrupulous um law enforcements in in
 
01:06:05.789 --> 01:06:05.799 align:start position:0%
other states kind of Target um people
 
01:06:07.990 --> 01:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
traveling through and you know there's
 
01:06:11.069 --> 01:06:11.079 align:start position:0%
plenty of cases like that um and don't
 
01:06:13.069 --> 01:06:13.079 align:start position:0%
even necessarily charge them with a
 
01:06:15.870 --> 01:06:15.880 align:start position:0%
crime but they just you know charge the
 
01:06:18.510 --> 01:06:18.520 align:start position:0%
property with the crime right and so but
 
01:06:20.589 --> 01:06:20.599 align:start position:0%
that's not going to be the case here
 
01:06:23.789 --> 01:06:23.799 align:start position:0%
right so so the the prosecutor in these
 
01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
kind of cases in New Hampshire
 
01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
first of all they have to convict them
 
01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
of a drug crime right so they're guilty
 
01:06:33.109 --> 01:06:33.119 align:start position:0%
of the drug crime but they also have to
 
01:06:37.309 --> 01:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
connect the property with the crime so
 
01:06:40.910 --> 01:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
um if the defendant can say yeah I cash
 
01:06:43.870 --> 01:06:43.880 align:start position:0%
my paycheck and that's my
 
01:06:46.789 --> 01:06:46.799 align:start position:0%
$1,000 well then that's not you know the
 
01:06:48.670 --> 01:06:48.680 align:start position:0%
the state won't be able to prove that
 
01:06:51.870 --> 01:06:51.880 align:start position:0%
this money came from trucks right but if
 
01:06:56.309 --> 01:06:56.319 align:start position:0%
but if um um the undercover cop bought
 
01:06:58.870 --> 01:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
drugs from the guy and marked the bills
 
01:07:01.150 --> 01:07:01.160 align:start position:0%
and there are the Bills you know I mean
 
01:07:04.710 --> 01:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
then it clearly is right so so I'm not
 
01:07:07.670 --> 01:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
so worried about you know yes it's only
 
01:07:11.349 --> 01:07:11.359 align:start position:0%
$1,000 but there's some burden of proof
 
01:07:13.990 --> 01:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
there and and especially the key part is
 
01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
the person's guilty of the drug crime
 
01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:17.670 align:start position:0%
the person's guilty of the drug crime
thank

01:07:17.670 --> 01:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:07:21.390 --> 01:07:21.400 align:start position:0%
you representative tur yeah and actually
 
01:07:23.789 --> 01:07:23.799 align:start position:0%
my question Builds on what uh
 
01:07:25.589 --> 01:07:25.599 align:start position:0%
representative McFarland asked and and
 
01:07:26.950 --> 01:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
you may have partially answered it but I
 
01:07:29.829 --> 01:07:29.839 align:start position:0%
want to check um that this Clause the
 
01:07:31.309 --> 01:07:31.319 align:start position:0%
minimum seems to be one of the more
 
01:07:35.750 --> 01:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
compelling changes in in the bill um I
 
01:07:37.630 --> 01:07:37.640 align:start position:0%
was going to ask if we have any
 
01:07:39.910 --> 01:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
statistics on what portion of civil
 
01:07:42.510 --> 01:07:42.520 align:start position:0%
forfeitures fall below those those
 
01:07:44.269 --> 01:07:44.279 align:start position:0%
minimums and sort of how much volume
 
01:07:47.990 --> 01:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
this might take out of of the system but
 
01:07:50.230 --> 01:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
did I understand that really there is no
 
01:07:51.670 --> 01:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
answer to that because we don't actually
 
01:07:54.470 --> 01:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
do that now um yeah thank you for the
 
01:07:58.630 --> 01:07:58.640 align:start position:0%
question so so the whole business of
 
01:08:01.870 --> 01:08:01.880 align:start position:0%
reporting and what's going on now needs
 
01:08:04.510 --> 01:08:04.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of work and the next bill you will
 
01:08:08.950 --> 01:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
be hearing addresses exactly that so so
 
01:08:12.309 --> 01:08:12.319 align:start position:0%
this is a good setup for for that bill
 
01:08:14.309 --> 01:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
um but I would save your questions for
 
01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
for that thank you any other questions
 
01:08:19.870 --> 01:08:19.880 align:start position:0%
representative Manos thank you Mr chair
 
01:08:21.590 --> 01:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question how
 
01:08:23.829 --> 01:08:23.839 align:start position:0%
does this fit in with the federal
 
01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
forfeiture law yes thank you for the
 
01:08:30.950 --> 01:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
question so this does not affect um the
 
01:08:33.550 --> 01:08:33.560 align:start position:0%
federal law in any way my original
 
01:08:37.229 --> 01:08:37.239 align:start position:0%
legislation from two years ago would
 
01:08:42.309 --> 01:08:42.319 align:start position:0%
have um so it's essentially up to law
 
01:08:45.789 --> 01:08:45.799 align:start position:0%
enforcement and federal prosecutors to
 
01:08:48.229 --> 01:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
decide whether to prosecute these kind
 
01:08:51.349 --> 01:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
of cases under federal law or under
 
01:08:53.789 --> 01:08:53.799 align:start position:0%
state law I mean drugs are a crime
 
01:08:58.269 --> 01:08:58.279 align:start position:0%
either way right so so um so they make a
 
01:09:01.870 --> 01:09:01.880 align:start position:0%
decision and it tends to be the bigger
 
01:09:04.630 --> 01:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
cases or the cases that go across state
 
01:09:06.789 --> 01:09:06.799 align:start position:0%
boundary of course would be federal
 
01:09:09.829 --> 01:09:09.839 align:start position:0%
crimes and some of the more minor stuff
 
01:09:13.470 --> 01:09:13.480 align:start position:0%
and the things that are 100% local would
 
01:09:16.590 --> 01:09:16.600 align:start position:0%
would tend to be State crimes and but in
 
01:09:19.950 --> 01:09:19.960 align:start position:0%
general um law enforcement is allowed to
 
01:09:22.630 --> 01:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
sort of bring the case to whatever
 
01:09:24.430 --> 01:09:24.440 align:start position:0%
prosecutor they want the federal
 
01:09:27.749 --> 01:09:27.759 align:start position:0%
prosecutor or or the or the local one
 
01:09:32.390 --> 01:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
and so um my original Bill tried to
 
01:09:35.229 --> 01:09:35.239 align:start position:0%
steer some of the more of the cases away
 
01:09:37.669 --> 01:09:37.679 align:start position:0%
from the federal prosecutor and into
 
01:09:40.149 --> 01:09:40.159 align:start position:0%
state court because under this
 
01:09:43.110 --> 01:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
legislation it's my opinion that that
 
01:09:46.189 --> 01:09:46.199 align:start position:0%
the state procedures are superior to to
 
01:09:49.070 --> 01:09:49.080 align:start position:0%
the ones in federal court it's it's it
 
01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
becomes an adjunct to the criminal case
 
01:09:53.789 --> 01:09:53.799 align:start position:0%
you have to have a criminal conviction
 
01:09:55.910 --> 01:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
before you can have asset
 
01:09:58.950 --> 01:09:58.960 align:start position:0%
forfeiture um you have the defendant
 
01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
Avail the the defense attorney available
 
01:10:03.390 --> 01:10:03.400 align:start position:0%
all those kind of things make this
 
01:10:06.510 --> 01:10:06.520 align:start position:0%
situation in State Court fairer than in
 
01:10:10.510 --> 01:10:10.520 align:start position:0%
federal court but um we
 
01:10:12.950 --> 01:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
decided because this is a serious
 
01:10:15.550 --> 01:10:15.560 align:start position:0%
objection from law enforcement they like
 
01:10:18.669 --> 01:10:18.679 align:start position:0%
the flexibility of of choosing where
 
01:10:22.830 --> 01:10:22.840 align:start position:0%
where cases get prosecuted and um so we
 
01:10:24.990 --> 01:10:25.000 align:start position:0%
decided we we remove that from the bill
 
01:10:27.030 --> 01:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
so the the bill the bill is strictly
 
01:10:30.149 --> 01:10:30.159 align:start position:0%
about what happens in State Court it
 
01:10:34.590 --> 01:10:34.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't control in any way uh where the
 
01:10:37.110 --> 01:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
case goes that's the same process as it
 
01:10:38.750 --> 01:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:10:40.750 --> 01:10:40.760 align:start position:0%
today any other questions for this
 
01:10:43.270 --> 01:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you thank you
 
01:10:44.990 --> 01:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman my other committee is
 
01:10:48.070 --> 01:10:48.080 align:start position:0%
meeting so I will leave and come back if
 
01:10:49.590 --> 01:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
you don't
 
01:11:02.990 --> 01:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:04.709 --> 01:11:04.719 align:start position:0%
good morning Erin krian general counsel
 
01:11:07.870 --> 01:11:07.880 align:start position:0%
for the judicial branch um coming to uh
 
01:11:09.390 --> 01:11:09.400 align:start position:0%
discuss the engagement that we had with
 
01:11:11.390 --> 01:11:11.400 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire which was uh
 
01:11:13.310 --> 01:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
appreciate his great thoroughness on
 
01:11:14.790 --> 01:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
looking at all aspects of the bill and
 
01:11:16.110 --> 01:11:16.120 align:start position:0%
and who it affects and one of those
 
01:11:19.070 --> 01:11:19.080 align:start position:0%
people was us um sometimes cases of
 
01:11:20.350 --> 01:11:20.360 align:start position:0%
different types are called at the same
 
01:11:22.149 --> 01:11:22.159 align:start position:0%
time probation violations can be called
 
01:11:24.110 --> 01:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
at the same time as the new charge but
 
01:11:26.110 --> 01:11:26.120 align:start position:0%
they they are still tracked by the the
 
01:11:29.030 --> 01:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
court system in a particular way um it
 
01:11:31.350 --> 01:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
is not uncommon at all that for a bill
 
01:11:32.630 --> 01:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
that has a very important policy
 
01:11:34.630 --> 01:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
objective there is a minor and ancillary
 
01:11:37.070 --> 01:11:37.080 align:start position:0%
Court implementation concern that is uh
 
01:11:38.950 --> 01:11:38.960 align:start position:0%
not the primary issue in the bill but
 
01:11:40.950 --> 01:11:40.960 align:start position:0%
potentially creates difficulties or
 
01:11:43.229 --> 01:11:43.239 align:start position:0%
costs for us um and we appreciate the
 
01:11:44.550 --> 01:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity to talk with representative
 
01:11:46.189 --> 01:11:46.199 align:start position:0%
McGuire we brought in our ecourt people
 
01:11:48.350 --> 01:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
we brought in our Superior Court people
 
01:11:49.709 --> 01:11:49.719 align:start position:0%
um and we think that this is the way
 
01:11:51.110 --> 01:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
that we can implement the bill without
 
01:11:53.510 --> 01:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
changing our case tracking system so for
 
01:11:56.470 --> 01:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
us the bill has likely no cost um you
 
01:11:57.830 --> 01:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
know we've had it looked at and we
 
01:11:59.430 --> 01:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
believe we can Implement It ultimately
 
01:12:00.950 --> 01:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
the policy determination about whether
 
01:12:02.910 --> 01:12:02.920 align:start position:0%
to pursue it is of course up to the
 
01:12:05.030 --> 01:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
legislature um but I do want to appear
 
01:12:06.830 --> 01:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
if anyone has questions about the
 
01:12:08.910 --> 01:12:08.920 align:start position:0%
Court's ability to implement the bill
 
01:12:11.750 --> 01:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
okay so is it true and and this is a
 
01:12:14.790 --> 01:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
pretty lengthy bill is it true that just
 
01:12:17.629 --> 01:12:17.639 align:start position:0%
it's on it just affects the court
 
01:12:19.950 --> 01:12:19.960 align:start position:0%
procedure and how it's handled and not
 
01:12:21.229 --> 01:12:21.239 align:start position:0%
necessarily law enforcement's
 
01:12:23.470 --> 01:12:23.480 align:start position:0%
involvement in it I would not want to um
 
01:12:25.709 --> 01:12:25.719 align:start position:0%
speak for law enforcement uh I I see
 
01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
they are uh present and potentially able
 
01:12:29.550 --> 01:12:29.560 align:start position:0%
to speak for themselves but in terms of
 
01:12:31.149 --> 01:12:31.159 align:start position:0%
the court procedures we have the ability
 
01:12:32.950 --> 01:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
to implement it so for us it is just a
 
01:12:34.590 --> 01:12:34.600 align:start position:0%
procedural change and and we can make
 
01:12:38.350 --> 01:12:38.360 align:start position:0%
that change thank you anyone
 
01:12:43.149 --> 01:12:43.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:02.669 --> 01:13:02.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:04.950 --> 01:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
uh good morning Mr chair members of the
 
01:13:06.709 --> 01:13:06.719 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for the opportunity
 
01:13:09.149 --> 01:13:09.159 align:start position:0%
to testify this morning uh my name is
 
01:13:10.750 --> 01:13:10.760 align:start position:0%
Alistair Whitney and I'm legislative
 
01:13:14.070 --> 01:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
counsel at The Institute for justice uh
 
01:13:16.390 --> 01:13:16.400 align:start position:0%
The Institute for justice is a nonprofit
 
01:13:17.870 --> 01:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
public interest law firm that works
 
01:13:19.510 --> 01:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
around the country in both state houses
 
01:13:21.310 --> 01:13:21.320 align:start position:0%
and cour houses to protect people's
 
01:13:23.790 --> 01:13:23.800 align:start position:0%
private property rights and we as part
 
01:13:26.149 --> 01:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
of this work have worked work to reform
 
01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
civil asset forfeiture laws
 
01:13:31.110 --> 01:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
Nationwide um we strongly encourage the
 
01:13:33.629 --> 01:13:33.639 align:start position:0%
committee to support this bill um this
 
01:13:36.590 --> 01:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
bill would make uh modest but incredibly
 
01:13:38.189 --> 01:13:38.199 align:start position:0%
meaningful changes to the Civil asset
 
01:13:42.550 --> 01:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
forfeiture system uh in this state um
 
01:13:45.669 --> 01:13:45.679 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this bill is to protect
 
01:13:48.709 --> 01:13:48.719 align:start position:0%
Property Owners importantly the innocent
 
01:13:51.310 --> 01:13:51.320 align:start position:0%
and Accord stronger due process rights
 
01:13:54.709 --> 01:13:54.719 align:start position:0%
um to individuals facing the forfeiture
 
01:13:54.719 --> 01:13:55.990 align:start position:0%
um to individuals facing the forfeiture
proed

01:13:55.990 --> 01:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
proed
 
01:13:58.310 --> 01:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
and also it is important for the
 
01:14:00.149 --> 01:14:00.159 align:start position:0%
purposes of judicial
 
01:14:00.159 --> 01:14:02.070 align:start position:0%
purposes of judicial
economy

01:14:02.070 --> 01:14:02.080 align:start position:0%
economy
 
01:14:04.750 --> 01:14:04.760 align:start position:0%
um I want to be clear the way that this
 
01:14:06.870 --> 01:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
bill was designed uh means that civil
 
01:14:09.950 --> 01:14:09.960 align:start position:0%
asset forfeiture will still remain but
 
01:14:11.550 --> 01:14:11.560 align:start position:0%
the important part of this bill is that
 
01:14:13.550 --> 01:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
it brings the Civil asset forfeiture
 
01:14:16.510 --> 01:14:16.520 align:start position:0%
process in court Under the Umbrella of
 
01:14:19.430 --> 01:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
the criminal proceedings meaning after a
 
01:14:22.830 --> 01:14:22.840 align:start position:0%
conviction in Criminal Court the court
 
01:14:25.910 --> 01:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh the state may then seize uh excuse me
 
01:14:29.470 --> 01:14:29.480 align:start position:0%
uh seek the forfeiture of the property
 
01:14:32.669 --> 01:14:32.679 align:start position:0%
um uh the defendant's property and we
 
01:14:34.990 --> 01:14:35.000 align:start position:0%
imagine this to be somewhat of a summary
 
01:14:38.870 --> 01:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
proceeding at the end of uh trial it can
 
01:14:40.270 --> 01:14:40.280 align:start position:0%
be done at sentencing or at the Court's
 
01:14:43.229 --> 01:14:43.239 align:start position:0%
discretion it just needs to be um after
 
01:14:46.590 --> 01:14:46.600 align:start position:0%
uh the defendant is found guilty
 
01:14:49.390 --> 01:14:49.400 align:start position:0%
um by doing it this
 
01:14:52.990 --> 01:14:53.000 align:start position:0%
way the defendant will have the right to
 
01:14:55.550 --> 01:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
counsel in the Civil for forfeiture
 
01:14:58.189 --> 01:14:58.199 align:start position:0%
hearing because it is a part of the
 
01:15:00.590 --> 01:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
underlying criminal prosecution and
 
01:15:04.430 --> 01:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
trial right now defendants do not have
 
01:15:07.830 --> 01:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
the right to counsel when they face the
 
01:15:11.430 --> 01:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
loss of property as a result of their
 
01:15:13.750 --> 01:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
criminal activity we think that this is
 
01:15:16.590 --> 01:15:16.600 align:start position:0%
really important we think that a
 
01:15:18.510 --> 01:15:18.520 align:start position:0%
defendant should have the right to
 
01:15:22.870 --> 01:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
counsel when they are uh stand to lose
 
01:15:25.110 --> 01:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
uh property um even if it is connected
 
01:15:26.030 --> 01:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
to criminal
 
01:15:29.030 --> 01:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
activity um and moreover it will be
 
01:15:30.709 --> 01:15:30.719 align:start position:0%
efficient for the courts I think to
 
01:15:33.590 --> 01:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
handle these cases in this manner right
 
01:15:37.790 --> 01:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
instead of two courtrooms two judges two
 
01:15:40.550 --> 01:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
prosecutors possibly two attorneys right
 
01:15:44.189 --> 01:15:44.199 align:start position:0%
and two cases we're essentially merging
 
01:15:46.709 --> 01:15:46.719 align:start position:0%
and marrying the Civil forfeiture
 
01:15:52.709 --> 01:15:52.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:54.830 --> 01:15:54.840 align:start position:0%
um another important part of this bill
 
01:15:57.669 --> 01:15:57.679 align:start position:0%
is finally is that innocent owners will
 
01:16:00.390 --> 01:16:00.400 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to petition the
 
01:16:03.189 --> 01:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
court and to let put everybody on notice
 
01:16:04.550 --> 01:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
that they did not have actual knowledge
 
01:16:05.990 --> 01:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
that their property was being connected
 
01:16:08.950 --> 01:16:08.960 align:start position:0%
to the alleged criminal activity and
 
01:16:10.510 --> 01:16:10.520 align:start position:0%
this is one of the most important parts
 
01:16:15.110 --> 01:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
of the bill because it allows uh the uh
 
01:16:18.470 --> 01:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
this body to uh fix one of the the
 
01:16:21.550 --> 01:16:21.560 align:start position:0%
biggest problems that we have with civil
 
01:16:23.790 --> 01:16:23.800 align:start position:0%
asset forfeiture and that is that it too
 
01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:25.310 align:start position:0%
asset forfeiture and that is that it too
often

01:16:25.310 --> 01:16:25.320 align:start position:0%
often
 
01:16:27.990 --> 01:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
punishes completely innocent
 
01:16:31.270 --> 01:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
people imagine Grandma like I think like
 
01:16:32.590 --> 01:16:32.600 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire said imagine
 
01:16:34.709 --> 01:16:34.719 align:start position:0%
Grandma lends her grandson her 1996
 
01:16:36.990 --> 01:16:37.000 align:start position:0%
Saturn Ion it's a beer of a car right
 
01:16:40.030 --> 01:16:40.040 align:start position:0%
unbeknownst to her grandson is selling
 
01:16:41.910 --> 01:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
meth out of and using the vehicle to get
 
01:16:44.590 --> 01:16:44.600 align:start position:0%
around and sell sell meth right the car
 
01:16:46.750 --> 01:16:46.760 align:start position:0%
is seized because it is connected to an
 
01:16:49.189 --> 01:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
alleged criminal activity and then it is
 
01:16:52.310 --> 01:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
subject to forfeiture and Grandma is out
 
01:16:55.350 --> 01:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
of luck she's out of her car that car
 
01:16:58.510 --> 01:16:58.520 align:start position:0%
may be only worth $1,000 $1,500 to her
 
01:17:00.590 --> 01:17:00.600 align:start position:0%
uh or Kelly blook value but to her it
 
01:17:02.030 --> 01:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
may be worth a lot more it helps her get
 
01:17:04.149 --> 01:17:04.159 align:start position:0%
to her appointments to work whatever
 
01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
right under this bill uh that car would
 
01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
no longer be subject to seizure and
 
01:17:10.149 --> 01:17:10.159 align:start position:0%
forfeiture and if that car value was a
 
01:17:12.550 --> 01:17:12.560 align:start position:0%
little bit higher if it was a newer car
 
01:17:15.229 --> 01:17:15.239 align:start position:0%
then grandma would have a opportunity to
 
01:17:16.590 --> 01:17:16.600 align:start position:0%
petition the court and to put everybody
 
01:17:19.030 --> 01:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
on notice that that is um her vehicle
 
01:17:20.510 --> 01:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
and that she had no actual knowledge
 
01:17:23.830 --> 01:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
that I was being used in a criminal um
 
01:17:27.030 --> 01:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:28.229 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:17:28.229 --> 01:17:28.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:17:31.910 --> 01:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
Alexander oh I'm finish first okay oh I
 
01:17:33.590 --> 01:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
thought he was finished oh I I just have
 
01:17:35.070 --> 01:17:35.080 align:start position:0%
a few more points I'm happy to take
 
01:17:38.110 --> 01:17:38.120 align:start position:0%
question now no I'm happy no no I
 
01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:39.790 align:start position:0%
question now no I'm happy no no I
apologize

01:17:39.790 --> 01:17:39.800 align:start position:0%
apologize
 
01:17:42.470 --> 01:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
um as representative Maguire said and as
 
01:17:44.229 --> 01:17:44.239 align:start position:0%
been discussed earlier this product this
 
01:17:46.830 --> 01:17:46.840 align:start position:0%
bill is a product of years and years of
 
01:17:49.510 --> 01:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
conversations consensus and compromise
 
01:17:52.229 --> 01:17:52.239 align:start position:0%
and um really uh an attempt to be very
 
01:17:54.310 --> 01:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
differential to law enforcement's needs
 
01:17:58.910 --> 01:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
um this is not the C change in law uh
 
01:18:01.430 --> 01:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
that I think some have made it out to be
 
01:18:03.229 --> 01:18:03.239 align:start position:0%
um and I want to tell you
 
01:18:06.430 --> 01:18:06.440 align:start position:0%
why this this bill does not really
 
01:18:07.870 --> 01:18:07.880 align:start position:0%
affect seizures of property law
 
01:18:10.229 --> 01:18:10.239 align:start position:0%
enforcement will still be able to seize
 
01:18:11.830 --> 01:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
property subject of course to that
 
01:18:15.390 --> 01:18:15.400 align:start position:0%
$5,000 and $1,000 restriction on uh
 
01:18:17.669 --> 01:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
Automobiles and currency
 
01:18:17.679 --> 01:18:19.629 align:start position:0%
Automobiles and currency
respectively

01:18:19.629 --> 01:18:19.639 align:start position:0%
respectively
 
01:18:22.950 --> 01:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
um but money found near drugs are no
 
01:18:24.750 --> 01:18:24.760 align:start position:0%
longer presumptively for forfeitable
 
01:18:26.070 --> 01:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
currency found your drugs no longer
 
01:18:28.030 --> 01:18:28.040 align:start position:0%
presumptively for forfeitable that is
 
01:18:33.070 --> 01:18:33.080 align:start position:0%
one change the other is um uh no I'm
 
01:18:34.430 --> 01:18:34.440 align:start position:0%
sorry and these are the exceptions to
 
01:18:38.470 --> 01:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
that so right um no roadside waivers
 
01:18:40.310 --> 01:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
right so we don't want to see um the
 
01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
instance and not alleging that it
 
01:18:42.990 --> 01:18:43.000 align:start position:0%
happens here all the time but we've seen
 
01:18:44.830 --> 01:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
it in other places where law enforcement
 
01:18:47.149 --> 01:18:47.159 align:start position:0%
pulls somebody over and they say hey in
 
01:18:49.470 --> 01:18:49.480 align:start position:0%
exchange for not arresting you you give
 
01:18:51.110 --> 01:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
me your car and I can let you walk
 
01:18:52.430 --> 01:18:52.440 align:start position:0%
because I see a bunch of cash in the
 
01:18:53.510 --> 01:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
back seat and I think that's connected
 
01:18:54.510 --> 01:18:54.520 align:start position:0%
to drugs we don't want to see that
 
01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:55.229 align:start position:0%
to drugs we don't want to see that
happen

01:18:55.229 --> 01:18:55.239 align:start position:0%
happen
 
01:18:57.629 --> 01:18:57.639 align:start position:0%
we will allow the defendant or the
 
01:18:59.070 --> 01:18:59.080 align:start position:0%
person to give up their property
 
01:19:00.870 --> 01:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
pursuant to a plea agreement signed on
 
01:19:02.750 --> 01:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
by the prosecuting Authority and the
 
01:19:04.510 --> 01:19:04.520 align:start position:0%
state but back to my original point I
 
01:19:05.470 --> 01:19:05.480 align:start position:0%
think I was getting a little ahead of
 
01:19:08.950 --> 01:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
myself this will really be Beyond those
 
01:19:10.669 --> 01:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
exceptions will not prevent law
 
01:19:12.430 --> 01:19:12.440 align:start position:0%
enforcement seizure of property for all
 
01:19:15.110 --> 01:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
intents and purposes right so they will
 
01:19:18.350 --> 01:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
still be able to seize property if it is
 
01:19:23.070 --> 01:19:23.080 align:start position:0%
suspected to be used uh as evidence in
 
01:19:27.390 --> 01:19:27.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:29.709 --> 01:19:29.719 align:start position:0%
um if it has any kind of evidentiary
 
01:19:32.870 --> 01:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
value in other words right um again
 
01:19:34.830 --> 01:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
subject to some of those exceptions on
 
01:19:38.149 --> 01:19:38.159 align:start position:0%
the thresholds um and I also want to
 
01:19:39.830 --> 01:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
point out that while this is a big Bill
 
01:19:42.750 --> 01:19:42.760 align:start position:0%
yes it really applies as relates to the
 
01:19:45.149 --> 01:19:45.159 align:start position:0%
forfeiture proceedings to a remarkably
 
01:19:47.910 --> 01:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
small number of cases but important that
 
01:19:50.510 --> 01:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
it still applies nonetheless this apply
 
01:19:52.629 --> 01:19:52.639 align:start position:0%
this applies to drug cases this does not
 
01:19:54.870 --> 01:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
apply to every case and as to the
 
01:19:57.110 --> 01:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
forfeiture proceeding um and defendants
 
01:20:00.310 --> 01:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
involvement in it um this applies to the
 
01:20:02.430 --> 01:20:02.440 align:start position:0%
even fewer number of cases that actually
 
01:20:05.350 --> 01:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
go all the way to trial and where trial
 
01:20:08.310 --> 01:20:08.320 align:start position:0%
results in a criminal conviction we are
 
01:20:14.350 --> 01:20:14.360 align:start position:0%
talking 1 to 2% of all cases tops and um
 
01:20:16.669 --> 01:20:16.679 align:start position:0%
relatedly as discussed before it in no
 
01:20:16.679 --> 01:20:17.669 align:start position:0%
relatedly as discussed before it in no
way

01:20:17.669 --> 01:20:17.679 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:20:19.470 --> 01:20:19.480 align:start position:0%
affects state law enforcement
 
01:20:21.510 --> 01:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
involvement with their Federal
 
01:20:24.950 --> 01:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
counterparts at all so this really only
 
01:20:27.350 --> 01:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
applies to seizure and forfeiture of
 
01:20:29.470 --> 01:20:29.480 align:start position:0%
property initiated and prosecuted under
 
01:20:33.750 --> 01:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
state law which uh my understanding uh
 
01:20:36.430 --> 01:20:36.440 align:start position:0%
affects High tens of thousands to low
 
01:20:38.910 --> 01:20:38.920 align:start position:0%
100s of thousands of forfeited property
 
01:20:40.070 --> 01:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
overall in the
 
01:20:42.830 --> 01:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
state so this bill is Laden with
 
01:20:45.390 --> 01:20:45.400 align:start position:0%
exceptions to understand and to nod to
 
01:20:46.590 --> 01:20:46.600 align:start position:0%
the good work that law enforcement is
 
01:20:49.070 --> 01:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
doing again police con sees property if
 
01:20:51.790 --> 01:20:51.800 align:start position:0%
it has evidentiary value for use in a
 
01:20:54.629 --> 01:20:54.639 align:start position:0%
upcoming uh criminal prosecution uh
 
01:20:57.629 --> 01:20:57.639 align:start position:0%
subject to the thresholds of course um
 
01:20:59.189 --> 01:20:59.199 align:start position:0%
the court can order forfeiture of
 
01:21:00.750 --> 01:21:00.760 align:start position:0%
property in Li of conviction if the
 
01:21:03.550 --> 01:21:03.560 align:start position:0%
defendant dies or flees the jurisdiction
 
01:21:06.990 --> 01:21:07.000 align:start position:0%
or is deported and um it allows the
 
01:21:09.189 --> 01:21:09.199 align:start position:0%
court to order the forfeiture of
 
01:21:10.870 --> 01:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
substitute property if the defendant
 
01:21:12.590 --> 01:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
sells it hides it or otherwise
 
01:21:15.350 --> 01:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
dissipates it um prior to a forfeiture
 
01:21:18.350 --> 01:21:18.360 align:start position:0%
order I know there's a lot here um I'm
 
01:21:19.870 --> 01:21:19.880 align:start position:0%
one of the attorneys that I think
 
01:21:21.590 --> 01:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire was talking about
 
01:21:23.629 --> 01:21:23.639 align:start position:0%
earlier so I'm happy to answer any
 
01:21:25.590 --> 01:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
questions that you have and I again
 
01:21:27.950 --> 01:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
encourage you to support this Bill thank
 
01:21:29.709 --> 01:21:29.719 align:start position:0%
you so much for your
 
01:21:33.270 --> 01:21:33.280 align:start position:0%
time okay representative Alexander thank
 
01:21:35.270 --> 01:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
you um if you if you'll indulge me I
 
01:21:37.110 --> 01:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
have a few questions if that's okay of
 
01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:38.070 align:start position:0%
have a few questions if that's okay of
course

01:21:38.070 --> 01:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
course
 
01:21:41.110 --> 01:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
um so this bill would expand the the
 
01:21:44.430 --> 01:21:44.440 align:start position:0%
public defender um the need for a public
 
01:21:46.590 --> 01:21:46.600 align:start position:0%
defender for civil proceedings in the in
 
01:21:48.110 --> 01:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
civil forfeiture
 
01:21:50.990 --> 01:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
cases correct and what it would do again
 
01:21:52.629 --> 01:21:52.639 align:start position:0%
is that it would require the public
 
01:21:54.310 --> 01:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
defender to represent the defendant in
 
01:21:56.070 --> 01:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
that short hearing as a part of
 
01:21:58.709 --> 01:21:58.719 align:start position:0%
sentencing or another post-trial motion
 
01:22:00.750 --> 01:22:00.760 align:start position:0%
um or at the Court's discretion post
 
01:22:03.709 --> 01:22:03.719 align:start position:0%
conviction um and extend that right to
 
01:22:08.149 --> 01:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
counsel in that very um uh what we
 
01:22:10.110 --> 01:22:10.120 align:start position:0%
presume to be in most cases a very kind
 
01:22:13.510 --> 01:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
of summary hearing okay and I I guess I
 
01:22:15.510 --> 01:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
guess I have a problem with that if
 
01:22:17.229 --> 01:22:17.239 align:start position:0%
there are
 
01:22:19.550 --> 01:22:19.560 align:start position:0%
defendants not getting counsel in
 
01:22:21.350 --> 01:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
criminal cases and then we're extending
 
01:22:23.149 --> 01:22:23.159 align:start position:0%
it to something else like you know we
 
01:22:24.669 --> 01:22:24.679 align:start position:0%
had we had a public defender office
 
01:22:26.070 --> 01:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
testified the other day like you know
 
01:22:28.149 --> 01:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
they're already like strapped with in
 
01:22:29.629 --> 01:22:29.639 align:start position:0%
they're they're overburdened with case
 
01:22:32.229 --> 01:22:32.239 align:start position:0%
load so even the expansion to some sort
 
01:22:36.149 --> 01:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
of civil case in a limited situation
 
01:22:37.669 --> 01:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
could do you believe that that could
 
01:22:41.070 --> 01:22:41.080 align:start position:0%
deny Justice to those in criminal cases
 
01:22:42.310 --> 01:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
that aren't getting the attention from
 
01:22:44.470 --> 01:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
the public defender they deserve I I
 
01:22:46.709 --> 01:22:46.719 align:start position:0%
don't think so I don't know obviously
 
01:22:48.830 --> 01:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
what the um public defender office was
 
01:22:50.310 --> 01:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
specifically referencing here of course
 
01:22:51.830 --> 01:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
in this country in this state you have a
 
01:22:53.149 --> 01:22:53.159 align:start position:0%
represent you have a right to represent
 
01:22:54.629 --> 01:22:54.639 align:start position:0%
yourself prosay maybe folks are
 
01:22:56.430 --> 01:22:56.440 align:start position:0%
exercising that and if folks decide to
 
01:22:58.750 --> 01:22:58.760 align:start position:0%
do that that's absolutely fine right but
 
01:23:01.430 --> 01:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
what we are envisioning here with this
 
01:23:04.110 --> 01:23:04.120 align:start position:0%
is that um it would add very little
 
01:23:06.310 --> 01:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
workload to the public defender office
 
01:23:09.550 --> 01:23:09.560 align:start position:0%
to enter to hear to work on this
 
01:23:12.830 --> 01:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
proceeding after a criminal uh uh a
 
01:23:15.229 --> 01:23:15.239 align:start position:0%
judgment of guilty or you know is is is
 
01:23:18.590 --> 01:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
found um by the court and um it can be
 
01:23:20.910 --> 01:23:20.920 align:start position:0%
done at sentencing so public defenders
 
01:23:21.950 --> 01:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
already going to show up right if
 
01:23:24.870 --> 01:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
there's a motion um to or pleading is
 
01:23:26.430 --> 01:23:26.440 align:start position:0%
filed by the state to initiate the
 
01:23:29.030 --> 01:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
forfeiture of product uh the property at
 
01:23:30.950 --> 01:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
that point or in some other post trial
 
01:23:32.709 --> 01:23:32.719 align:start position:0%
motion we don't think it would add a
 
01:23:35.790 --> 01:23:35.800 align:start position:0%
whole lot of work um but it is our Point
 
01:23:37.629 --> 01:23:37.639 align:start position:0%
here that these people are being
 
01:23:40.870 --> 01:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
Property Owners uh are being deprived of
 
01:23:43.669 --> 01:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
their right to counsel today and what
 
01:23:45.510 --> 01:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire said is
 
01:23:46.750 --> 01:23:46.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely true regarding default
 
01:23:49.110 --> 01:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
judgment four out of five Property
 
01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:50.149 align:start position:0%
judgment four out of five Property
Owners

01:23:50.149 --> 01:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
Owners
 
01:23:53.030 --> 01:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
Nationwide um can't even show up to the
 
01:23:56.990 --> 01:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
Civil courtroom to contest the seizure
 
01:23:58.830 --> 01:23:58.840 align:start position:0%
and forfeiture of their property a
 
01:24:00.790 --> 01:24:00.800 align:start position:0%
because attorneys are expensive and if
 
01:24:02.990 --> 01:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
you lose a $1,000 car it doesn't make
 
01:24:05.110 --> 01:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
sense to hire an attorney for $3,000
 
01:24:07.110 --> 01:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
just to try to get that car back and
 
01:24:10.149 --> 01:24:10.159 align:start position:0%
maybe not then you're out of $4,000 also
 
01:24:12.310 --> 01:24:12.320 align:start position:0%
trying to deal with the legal system on
 
01:24:13.830 --> 01:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
your own as maybe somebody who is
 
01:24:16.350 --> 01:24:16.360 align:start position:0%
unsophisticated in the law
 
01:24:19.669 --> 01:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
is it's that's that's a tolerator I I
 
01:24:21.910 --> 01:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
guess you just if if I could you just
 
01:24:25.030 --> 01:24:25.040 align:start position:0%
told me that some people represent
 
01:24:26.430 --> 01:24:26.440 align:start position:0%
themselves prosay in criminal
 
01:24:27.750 --> 01:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
proceedings and then you're telling me
 
01:24:29.990 --> 01:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
that they need a lawyer for to get their
 
01:24:32.629 --> 01:24:32.639 align:start position:0%
thousand car back but I I would argue
 
01:24:35.110 --> 01:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
that the absolutely you should not have
 
01:24:36.590 --> 01:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
to represent yourself prosay in a
 
01:24:39.149 --> 01:24:39.159 align:start position:0%
criminal proceeding you should be like
 
01:24:41.590 --> 01:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
you should have a a funded public
 
01:24:43.750 --> 01:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
defender we absolutely agree but it is
 
01:24:46.070 --> 01:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
your constitutional right sir yeah that
 
01:24:47.350 --> 01:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
that that was the only point that I was
 
01:24:49.350 --> 01:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
making if a person makes that choice
 
01:24:51.390 --> 01:24:51.400 align:start position:0%
freely and clearly and intelligently
 
01:24:53.270 --> 01:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
that they want to do that that is their
 
01:24:55.510 --> 01:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
constitutional right but we absolutely
 
01:24:58.149 --> 01:24:58.159 align:start position:0%
agree we we want to see people
 
01:25:00.270 --> 01:25:00.280 align:start position:0%
representative but I'll I'll wait a
 
01:25:02.510 --> 01:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
little bit repres representative
 
01:25:05.430 --> 01:25:05.440 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you very
 
01:25:07.830 --> 01:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
much uh thank you have you had an
 
01:25:11.550 --> 01:25:11.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity to review um the
 
01:25:15.790 --> 01:25:15.800 align:start position:0%
representative's amendment and do you
 
01:25:18.830 --> 01:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
support the language of the amendment uh
 
01:25:20.910 --> 01:25:20.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question yes I have
 
01:25:23.830 --> 01:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
thank you and if I could just follow up
 
01:25:26.870 --> 01:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to belabor this point
 
01:25:28.629 --> 01:25:28.639 align:start position:0%
that representative Al Alexander's
 
01:25:35.590 --> 01:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
making but um uh when you say that an
 
01:25:39.709 --> 01:25:39.719 align:start position:0%
individual has the right to proceed
 
01:25:39.719 --> 01:25:41.510 align:start position:0%
individual has the right to proceed
Pro

01:25:41.510 --> 01:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
Pro
 
01:25:44.709 --> 01:25:44.719 align:start position:0%
um I guess
 
01:25:48.990 --> 01:25:49.000 align:start position:0%
I'm I can't I can't separate that
 
01:25:52.709 --> 01:25:52.719 align:start position:0%
statement from uh another famous
 
01:25:54.750 --> 01:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
statement that was made in another
 
01:25:58.229 --> 01:25:58.239 align:start position:0%
context that both the rich and the poor
 
01:26:00.189 --> 01:26:00.199 align:start position:0%
have the right to sleep under
 
01:26:03.149 --> 01:26:03.159 align:start position:0%
bridges um understanding that the rich
 
01:26:06.109 --> 01:26:06.119 align:start position:0%
aren't going to sleep under bridges and
 
01:26:09.070 --> 01:26:09.080 align:start position:0%
the rich aren't going to be under
 
01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:12.910 align:start position:0%
the rich aren't going to be under
represented

01:26:12.910 --> 01:26:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:15.830 --> 01:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
um yet the point that you seem to be
 
01:26:20.109 --> 01:26:20.119 align:start position:0%
making is we shouldn't worry about that
 
01:26:22.669 --> 01:26:22.679 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry just to be perfectly clear um
 
01:26:26.189 --> 01:26:26.199 align:start position:0%
and thank you for the question um not
 
01:26:29.790 --> 01:26:29.800 align:start position:0%
really no my I think my point was just
 
01:26:32.030 --> 01:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
tangential relating to what the public
 
01:26:33.550 --> 01:26:33.560 align:start position:0%
defender's office may or may not have
 
01:26:36.510 --> 01:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
said relating to why or how people are
 
01:26:38.870 --> 01:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
not getting represented in court today
 
01:26:40.590 --> 01:26:40.600 align:start position:0%
again you have a constitutional right as
 
01:26:42.790 --> 01:26:42.800 align:start position:0%
a criminal defendant to choose whether
 
01:26:44.870 --> 01:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
or not you take you also have a right to
 
01:26:47.350 --> 01:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
to counsel but you have a right as a as
 
01:26:49.709 --> 01:26:49.719 align:start position:0%
a defendant to reject that Council and
 
01:26:51.470 --> 01:26:51.480 align:start position:0%
to proceed to trial
 
01:26:55.030 --> 01:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
prosay that is your constitutional right
 
01:26:57.310 --> 01:26:57.320 align:start position:0%
and uh just to clarify what we are
 
01:26:59.390 --> 01:26:59.400 align:start position:0%
saying is we would like to see that
 
01:27:02.149 --> 01:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
right to counsel extended to more
 
01:27:05.109 --> 01:27:05.119 align:start position:0%
individuals at the end the Civil asset
 
01:27:07.590 --> 01:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
forfeiture proceeding process because it
 
01:27:11.149 --> 01:27:11.159 align:start position:0%
is really part of the criminal trial and
 
01:27:13.830 --> 01:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
conviction in our in our view it is kind
 
01:27:15.870 --> 01:27:15.880 align:start position:0%
of through a work of legal fiction that
 
01:27:18.830 --> 01:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
the currently that the process is
 
01:27:21.750 --> 01:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
technically against the property itself
 
01:27:24.270 --> 01:27:24.280 align:start position:0%
and not the defendant when obviously the
 
01:27:26.470 --> 01:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
rights of the defendant are implicated
 
01:27:29.270 --> 01:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
when you take his or her property so
 
01:27:33.070 --> 01:27:33.080 align:start position:0%
just just to I and I hope I clarified
 
01:27:35.910 --> 01:27:35.920 align:start position:0%
okay representative McFarland thank you
 
01:27:38.990 --> 01:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I believe you were here for
 
01:27:40.669 --> 01:27:40.679 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire's testimony and
 
01:27:43.510 --> 01:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
and his answer to my question
 
01:27:45.910 --> 01:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
um particularly in light of what you
 
01:27:49.709 --> 01:27:49.719 align:start position:0%
were just describing around the
 
01:27:53.629 --> 01:27:53.639 align:start position:0%
hypothetical poor defendant um and I
 
01:27:55.510 --> 01:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
second representative Smith's comments
 
01:27:57.149 --> 01:27:57.159 align:start position:0%
in that
 
01:28:00.870 --> 01:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
regard what is your point of view on
 
01:28:02.790 --> 01:28:02.800 align:start position:0%
whether it would be meritorious to
 
01:28:06.189 --> 01:28:06.199 align:start position:0%
increase the $1,000 and $55,000 amounts
 
01:28:07.910 --> 01:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
that are written in the
 
01:28:11.910 --> 01:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you for the question um you
 
01:28:14.470 --> 01:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
know I think uh representative Maguire
 
01:28:16.950 --> 01:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
arrived at those numbers as not only a
 
01:28:18.629 --> 01:28:18.639 align:start position:0%
point of compromise but also looking at
 
01:28:21.270 --> 01:28:21.280 align:start position:0%
some of the data that my Law Firm has
 
01:28:23.430 --> 01:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
compiled around the country that points
 
01:28:26.510 --> 01:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
to that the the median value of seizures
 
01:28:29.629 --> 01:28:29.639 align:start position:0%
in most cases it's not 10 20 $30,000
 
01:28:32.189 --> 01:28:32.199 align:start position:0%
it's actually quite low um and it varies
 
01:28:34.189 --> 01:28:34.199 align:start position:0%
from place to place but really typically
 
01:28:36.669 --> 01:28:36.679 align:start position:0%
what we see is a median value between
 
01:28:40.950 --> 01:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
$800 worth of property and about uh $5
 
01:28:44.390 --> 01:28:44.400 align:start position:0%
$1600 at at the high end so this number
 
01:28:47.390 --> 01:28:47.400 align:start position:0%
I think was uh for policy reasons
 
01:28:51.149 --> 01:28:51.159 align:start position:0%
designed to protect the most vulnerable
 
01:28:54.350 --> 01:28:54.360 align:start position:0%
people and the people who likely are not
 
01:28:56.830 --> 01:28:56.840 align:start position:0%
going to be involved in these you know
 
01:28:58.590 --> 01:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
they're not drug kingpins if you're
 
01:29:01.229 --> 01:29:01.239 align:start position:0%
driving around a 1996 Saturn Ion and
 
01:29:03.990 --> 01:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
have 300 bucks of cash in in your your
 
01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:05.229 align:start position:0%
have 300 bucks of cash in in your your
passenger

01:29:05.229 --> 01:29:05.239 align:start position:0%
passenger
 
01:29:08.350 --> 01:29:08.360 align:start position:0%
seat any other questions representative
 
01:29:10.070 --> 01:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
Alexander thank you thank you for taking
 
01:29:11.550 --> 01:29:11.560 align:start position:0%
my question again so you've read the
 
01:29:13.790 --> 01:29:13.800 align:start position:0%
amendment representative Smith asked and
 
01:29:18.350 --> 01:29:18.360 align:start position:0%
um you're in support of it um the the my
 
01:29:20.149 --> 01:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
question goes back to my previous
 
01:29:24.149 --> 01:29:24.159 align:start position:0%
question about burden of proof um
 
01:29:25.709 --> 01:29:25.719 align:start position:0%
from your testimony you indicated that
 
01:29:28.430 --> 01:29:28.440 align:start position:0%
the burden of proof in order to say that
 
01:29:31.070 --> 01:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
you do not have actual knowledge of the
 
01:29:35.070 --> 01:29:35.080 align:start position:0%
crime would be on the innocent person to
 
01:29:37.950 --> 01:29:37.960 align:start position:0%
prove right uh thank you for the
 
01:29:39.709 --> 01:29:39.719 align:start position:0%
question no it would be on the state in
 
01:29:41.669 --> 01:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
that context in the context of the
 
01:29:44.629 --> 01:29:44.639 align:start position:0%
innocent owner hearing so basically how
 
01:29:46.629 --> 01:29:46.639 align:start position:0%
this works if if you allow me to explain
 
01:29:48.070 --> 01:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
the innocent owner comes to court and
 
01:29:50.390 --> 01:29:50.400 align:start position:0%
says hey Grandma comes to court say hey
 
01:29:51.950 --> 01:29:51.960 align:start position:0%
that's my car I had no idea my grandson
 
01:29:57.910 --> 01:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
was using it to s drugs um if the court
 
01:30:00.750 --> 01:30:00.760 align:start position:0%
accepts that and the state does not wish
 
01:30:02.669 --> 01:30:02.679 align:start position:0%
to proceed with a forfeiture grandma
 
01:30:05.229 --> 01:30:05.239 align:start position:0%
gets her car back right uh she can show
 
01:30:07.709 --> 01:30:07.719 align:start position:0%
the title she can say I was out of town
 
01:30:12.590 --> 01:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
I had no idea right um if the state says
 
01:30:14.830 --> 01:30:14.840 align:start position:0%
wait a second I we think maybe Grandma
 
01:30:18.510 --> 01:30:18.520 align:start position:0%
knew then it would be their burden a on
 
01:30:20.109 --> 01:30:20.119 align:start position:0%
a preponderance of the evidence uh
 
01:30:22.350 --> 01:30:22.360 align:start position:0%
standard to show that she had actual
 
01:30:24.510 --> 01:30:24.520 align:start position:0%
knowledge that the vehicle was in fact
 
01:30:25.830 --> 01:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
that she knew that the vehicle was in
 
01:30:29.910 --> 01:30:29.920 align:start position:0%
fact being used to trans transport drugs
 
01:30:33.189 --> 01:30:33.199 align:start position:0%
um so that is on the state to proove
 
01:30:36.030 --> 01:30:36.040 align:start position:0%
thank you would grandma have a right to
 
01:30:39.990 --> 01:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
quote appointed Council under this bill
 
01:30:42.629 --> 01:30:42.639 align:start position:0%
no I mean you
 
01:30:45.310 --> 01:30:45.320 align:start position:0%
know we would we would love to see that
 
01:30:47.070 --> 01:30:47.080 align:start position:0%
but that was one of the compromises that
 
01:30:49.709 --> 01:30:49.719 align:start position:0%
we had to work out so any other
 
01:30:53.189 --> 01:30:53.199 align:start position:0%
questions representative Morton so um to
 
01:30:55.470 --> 01:30:55.480 align:start position:0%
follow up with what uh thank you by the
 
01:30:57.310 --> 01:30:57.320 align:start position:0%
way and and thank you for the question
 
01:30:59.229 --> 01:30:59.239 align:start position:0%
here follow up with what representative
 
01:31:01.030 --> 01:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
Alexander was talking about the last
 
01:31:03.149 --> 01:31:03.159 align:start position:0%
sentence in this paragraph the state
 
01:31:05.310 --> 01:31:05.320 align:start position:0%
summarily shall return property such
 
01:31:07.870 --> 01:31:07.880 align:start position:0%
person um years ago I worked at a car
 
01:31:10.070 --> 01:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
dealership and somebody came in to take
 
01:31:12.830 --> 01:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
a test drive and then a few hours later
 
01:31:14.830 --> 01:31:14.840 align:start position:0%
we were like where'd that guy go he
 
01:31:17.390 --> 01:31:17.400 align:start position:0%
didn't come back yet and a couple days
 
01:31:20.310 --> 01:31:20.320 align:start position:0%
later um the Tilton police called us and
 
01:31:23.270 --> 01:31:23.280 align:start position:0%
said we got your car and uh they could
 
01:31:25.149 --> 01:31:25.159 align:start position:0%
tell by the the dealer plate and some
 
01:31:28.229 --> 01:31:28.239 align:start position:0%
other information and um and so it was
 
01:31:31.229 --> 01:31:31.239 align:start position:0%
used in in a drug crime and I don't know
 
01:31:33.430 --> 01:31:33.440 align:start position:0%
what extent there was or whatever but it
 
01:31:36.030 --> 01:31:36.040 align:start position:0%
was about 2 weeks before we received the
 
01:31:38.629 --> 01:31:38.639 align:start position:0%
car back at the dealership obviously it
 
01:31:40.950 --> 01:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
was quite obvious that we had no
 
01:31:42.790 --> 01:31:42.800 align:start position:0%
knowledge of what was the car was being
 
01:31:44.870 --> 01:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
used for
 
01:31:48.310 --> 01:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
um so when it says State summarily shall
 
01:31:50.350 --> 01:31:50.360 align:start position:0%
return property I mean that doesn't
 
01:31:52.510 --> 01:31:52.520 align:start position:0%
really say like is there a time limit I
 
01:31:54.629 --> 01:31:54.639 align:start position:0%
mean can they just do it couple weeks
 
01:31:56.990 --> 01:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
later I mean in that that case it it was
 
01:31:59.270 --> 01:31:59.280 align:start position:0%
literally like two weeks went by before
 
01:32:02.030 --> 01:32:02.040 align:start position:0%
we could get the car back thank you for
 
01:32:03.030 --> 01:32:03.040 align:start position:0%
the question I'm sorry would you mind
 
01:32:05.270 --> 01:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
directing me to the page and line that
 
01:32:06.669 --> 01:32:06.679 align:start position:0%
you're referring it's it's on the
 
01:32:09.149 --> 01:32:09.159 align:start position:0%
amendment on the third paragraph of the
 
01:32:12.070 --> 01:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
last it says state sarily in this case
 
01:32:13.750 --> 01:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
it was a town but I guess that would
 
01:32:16.270 --> 01:32:16.280 align:start position:0%
fall under the same circumstance as
 
01:32:17.950 --> 01:32:17.960 align:start position:0%
being the
 
01:32:19.950 --> 01:32:19.960 align:start position:0%
state yeah
 
01:32:23.590 --> 01:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
so as we understand it um because of the
 
01:32:26.550 --> 01:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
way that property might be stored um
 
01:32:29.430 --> 01:32:29.440 align:start position:0%
following a a seizure um we want to give
 
01:32:31.109 --> 01:32:31.119 align:start position:0%
law enforcement some flexibility to make
 
01:32:32.629 --> 01:32:32.639 align:start position:0%
sure that they can find the right
 
01:32:34.310 --> 01:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
property that they can retrieve it and
 
01:32:35.910 --> 01:32:35.920 align:start position:0%
that they can make sure that it has no
 
01:32:37.750 --> 01:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
evidentiary value for potential use at
 
01:32:41.270 --> 01:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
trial um so it's designed without a I I
 
01:32:44.310 --> 01:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
believe without an explicit timeline to
 
01:32:46.790 --> 01:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
um afford some flexibility and this was
 
01:32:48.550 --> 01:32:48.560 align:start position:0%
again a part of the compromise process
 
01:32:50.390 --> 01:32:50.400 align:start position:0%
we would like to see of course property
 
01:32:52.430 --> 01:32:52.440 align:start position:0%
return to the innocent owner to you to a
 
01:32:54.270 --> 01:32:54.280 align:start position:0%
secured interest owner as as soon as
 
01:32:56.950 --> 01:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
possible as soon as practical right but
 
01:32:59.350 --> 01:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
um we understand that in in some cases
 
01:33:01.310 --> 01:33:01.320 align:start position:0%
that may not be possible and we're just
 
01:33:03.550 --> 01:33:03.560 align:start position:0%
trying to give folks flexibility to get
 
01:33:05.430 --> 01:33:05.440 align:start position:0%
that property back thank you for the
 
01:33:08.430 --> 01:33:08.440 align:start position:0%
question any other questions seeing none
 
01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:09.790 align:start position:0%
question any other questions seeing none
thank

01:33:09.790 --> 01:33:09.800 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:33:39.870 --> 01:33:39.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:40.870 --> 01:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman members of the
 
01:33:42.390 --> 01:33:42.400 align:start position:0%
committee uh my name is liutenant Derek
 
01:33:44.070 --> 01:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
catalo from the Manchester amp Police
 
01:33:45.950 --> 01:33:45.960 align:start position:0%
Department I currently work in our
 
01:33:47.990 --> 01:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
special enforcement division which um
 
01:33:49.950 --> 01:33:49.960 align:start position:0%
handles primarily all our drug
 
01:33:52.149 --> 01:33:52.159 align:start position:0%
investigations um gang investigations
 
01:33:54.430 --> 01:33:54.440 align:start position:0%
Firearms investigations um and I
 
01:33:57.510 --> 01:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
personally deal with pretty not pretty
 
01:33:59.430 --> 01:33:59.440 align:start position:0%
much all of our Department's drug asset
 
01:34:03.229 --> 01:34:03.239 align:start position:0%
forfeiture um uh my written statement is
 
01:34:04.629 --> 01:34:04.639 align:start position:0%
going around I'm not going to read it
 
01:34:05.990 --> 01:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
verbatim to you I'm just going to hit
 
01:34:08.910 --> 01:34:08.920 align:start position:0%
some key points um one of which I'd like
 
01:34:12.109 --> 01:34:12.119 align:start position:0%
to start with is and lastly I'm here on
 
01:34:13.350 --> 01:34:13.360 align:start position:0%
behalf of the New Hampshire police
 
01:34:16.229 --> 01:34:16.239 align:start position:0%
Chiefs Association um our position in
 
01:34:18.669 --> 01:34:18.679 align:start position:0%
law enforcement is that our current bill
 
01:34:22.510 --> 01:34:22.520 align:start position:0%
is well vetted Fair reasonable has
 
01:34:24.830 --> 01:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
multiple layers of oversight site um
 
01:34:26.750 --> 01:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
from the officer's initial decision to
 
01:34:29.149 --> 01:34:29.159 align:start position:0%
someone like myself a supervisor review
 
01:34:30.629 --> 01:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
to the Attorney General's office
 
01:34:32.629 --> 01:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
decision to move forward with the case
 
01:34:34.229 --> 01:34:34.239 align:start position:0%
and finally to the judicial process
 
01:34:36.750 --> 01:34:36.760 align:start position:0%
where it plays out um we think it's fair
 
01:34:39.270 --> 01:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
we think it's reasonable we think it's a
 
01:34:42.590 --> 01:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
process that works well
 
01:34:45.270 --> 01:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
um one thing that I would like to point
 
01:34:50.270 --> 01:34:50.280 align:start position:0%
out is the changes to the current asset
 
01:34:53.510 --> 01:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
forfeiture were characterized as minimal
 
01:34:53.520 --> 01:34:55.030 align:start position:0%
forfeiture were characterized as minimal
um

01:34:55.030 --> 01:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:57.590 --> 01:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
law enforcement is in complete
 
01:34:58.709 --> 01:34:58.719 align:start position:0%
disagreement with that we feel the
 
01:35:02.030 --> 01:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
changes are quite drastic um and I'll go
 
01:35:04.750 --> 01:35:04.760 align:start position:0%
over our position of what why that is
 
01:35:08.350 --> 01:35:08.360 align:start position:0%
primarily um one of the issues is the
 
01:35:09.709 --> 01:35:09.719 align:start position:0%
and it was mentioned I think by
 
01:35:12.990 --> 01:35:13.000 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire um the change for
 
01:35:15.510 --> 01:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
the presumption of forfeiture for
 
01:35:17.870 --> 01:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
currency that is found in proximity to
 
01:35:21.870 --> 01:35:21.880 align:start position:0%
drugs during investigation so the reason
 
01:35:24.149 --> 01:35:24.159 align:start position:0%
that that currently exists
 
01:35:27.629 --> 01:35:27.639 align:start position:0%
is it is extremely difficult to connect
 
01:35:30.950 --> 01:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
a direct link between cash found and
 
01:35:33.709 --> 01:35:33.719 align:start position:0%
drug sales um obviously drug dealers
 
01:35:35.350 --> 01:35:35.360 align:start position:0%
don't provide receipts they're very
 
01:35:39.669 --> 01:35:39.679 align:start position:0%
careful with their um ledgers and if
 
01:35:43.629 --> 01:35:43.639 align:start position:0%
they even keep them or um conversations
 
01:35:45.950 --> 01:35:45.960 align:start position:0%
or communication between themselves and
 
01:35:48.910 --> 01:35:48.920 align:start position:0%
their customers uh and a large portion
 
01:35:51.510 --> 01:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
of our seizures OCC occur from street
 
01:35:52.990 --> 01:35:53.000 align:start position:0%
level interdiction stops which is often
 
01:35:55.390 --> 01:35:55.400 align:start position:0%
a patrol off officer observing drug
 
01:35:58.709 --> 01:35:58.719 align:start position:0%
Behavior making a stop having a roadside
 
01:36:00.709 --> 01:36:00.719 align:start position:0%
investigation seizing a car in a search
 
01:36:02.470 --> 01:36:02.480 align:start position:0%
warrant discovering large amounts of
 
01:36:04.510 --> 01:36:04.520 align:start position:0%
cash large amounts of drugs and then
 
01:36:06.550 --> 01:36:06.560 align:start position:0%
conducting the Civil asset forfeiture
 
01:36:09.070 --> 01:36:09.080 align:start position:0%
process uh with this change that will be
 
01:36:10.430 --> 01:36:10.440 align:start position:0%
completely wiped away because it's
 
01:36:13.510 --> 01:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
almost impossible for us to prove that
 
01:36:16.310 --> 01:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
specific cash came from drug sales um
 
01:36:19.070 --> 01:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
the process now is that is a pres there
 
01:36:20.550 --> 01:36:20.560 align:start position:0%
is a presumption of forfeiture which
 
01:36:22.390 --> 01:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
means we bring that cash in and the
 
01:36:26.149 --> 01:36:26.159 align:start position:0%
person can come in and show that I got
 
01:36:28.270 --> 01:36:28.280 align:start position:0%
that from inheritance I got that from
 
01:36:29.669 --> 01:36:29.679 align:start position:0%
these are my checks that I cash there's
 
01:36:31.950 --> 01:36:31.960 align:start position:0%
some documentation um I sold the car
 
01:36:34.350 --> 01:36:34.360 align:start position:0%
here's the bill of sale they can show
 
01:36:35.790 --> 01:36:35.800 align:start position:0%
that that cash is from legitimate means
 
01:36:39.030 --> 01:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
and the cash can be returned to them um
 
01:36:41.189 --> 01:36:41.199 align:start position:0%
it is written that way because of the
 
01:36:43.590 --> 01:36:43.600 align:start position:0%
difficulty of proving such uh a thing
 
01:36:45.390 --> 01:36:45.400 align:start position:0%
even in some of our long-term cases
 
01:36:47.750 --> 01:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
where we do more in-depth
 
01:36:50.870 --> 01:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
investigations with undercover officers
 
01:36:54.629 --> 01:36:54.639 align:start position:0%
um with extensive surveillance
 
01:36:56.590 --> 01:36:56.600 align:start position:0%
it even then it will be difficult to
 
01:36:59.750 --> 01:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
prove cash we find in a specific place
 
01:37:02.430 --> 01:37:02.440 align:start position:0%
is the actual cash directly linked to
 
01:37:04.470 --> 01:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
the drug crime and the drug sales that
 
01:37:08.510 --> 01:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
is a major major change um and building
 
01:37:08.520 --> 01:37:10.030 align:start position:0%
is a major major change um and building
on

01:37:10.030 --> 01:37:10.040 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:37:14.990 --> 01:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
that taking into account our neighbors
 
01:37:17.430 --> 01:37:17.440 align:start position:0%
to the south of Massachusetts their our
 
01:37:19.390 --> 01:37:19.400 align:start position:0%
set forfeiture law I think should be a
 
01:37:21.430 --> 01:37:21.440 align:start position:0%
major consideration here so the state of
 
01:37:23.390 --> 01:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts currently has an asset for
 
01:37:26.109 --> 01:37:26.119 align:start position:0%
LA La that is fairly similar to ours
 
01:37:29.750 --> 01:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
where once an officer seizes some money
 
01:37:33.109 --> 01:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
found in proxim of drugs the person who
 
01:37:35.709 --> 01:37:35.719 align:start position:0%
it is seized from can come forward and
 
01:37:37.830 --> 01:37:37.840 align:start position:0%
provide evidence of that is legitimate
 
01:37:40.390 --> 01:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
money that they got from legitimate
 
01:37:43.910 --> 01:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
means if this bill passes we will now
 
01:37:46.870 --> 01:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
have that fli and Massachusetts will
 
01:37:49.229 --> 01:37:49.239 align:start position:0%
remain the way they are uh and the
 
01:37:51.510 --> 01:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
reason I point that out is many drug
 
01:37:52.750 --> 01:37:52.760 align:start position:0%
trafficking organizations that are
 
01:37:55.070 --> 01:37:55.080 align:start position:0%
operating in our state are based in
 
01:37:57.310 --> 01:37:57.320 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts so right now there is
 
01:38:00.830 --> 01:38:00.840 align:start position:0%
essentially a even fiscal risk for them
 
01:38:02.669 --> 01:38:02.679 align:start position:0%
operating in either one so some will
 
01:38:04.229 --> 01:38:04.239 align:start position:0%
come up here they'll send we call them
 
01:38:06.430 --> 01:38:06.440 align:start position:0%
Runners people who drive up they sell
 
01:38:08.270 --> 01:38:08.280 align:start position:0%
drugs they return to Massachusetts and
 
01:38:11.070 --> 01:38:11.080 align:start position:0%
that's where their base of operations is
 
01:38:13.669 --> 01:38:13.679 align:start position:0%
now I obviously cannot tell you that we
 
01:38:15.510 --> 01:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
will have a massive influx of drug
 
01:38:17.669 --> 01:38:17.679 align:start position:0%
trafficking organizations changing home
 
01:38:21.510 --> 01:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
bases here but it is a factor that I
 
01:38:22.990 --> 01:38:23.000 align:start position:0%
think needs to be seriously considered
 
01:38:26.669 --> 01:38:26.679 align:start position:0%
with a bill like this because there will
 
01:38:30.229 --> 01:38:30.239 align:start position:0%
certainly be a less fiscally risky
 
01:38:32.510 --> 01:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
environment created here and like any
 
01:38:35.550 --> 01:38:35.560 align:start position:0%
business that is they will look for a
 
01:38:37.709 --> 01:38:37.719 align:start position:0%
environment that is easier for them to
 
01:38:39.270 --> 01:38:39.280 align:start position:0%
operate in and I think that's just a
 
01:38:41.350 --> 01:38:41.360 align:start position:0%
reality of this bill um and I think
 
01:38:43.350 --> 01:38:43.360 align:start position:0%
that's something law enforcement and
 
01:38:45.350 --> 01:38:45.360 align:start position:0%
myself and the association has a
 
01:38:47.310 --> 01:38:47.320 align:start position:0%
responsibility to point out to you that
 
01:38:49.470 --> 01:38:49.480 align:start position:0%
that is something we think you should
 
01:38:52.270 --> 01:38:52.280 align:start position:0%
seriously consider um a couple other
 
01:38:54.189 --> 01:38:54.199 align:start position:0%
things I wanted to mention is I heard
 
01:38:57.750 --> 01:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
some talk about seizing Grandma's car uh
 
01:39:00.510 --> 01:39:00.520 align:start position:0%
and I think that is that is
 
01:39:02.629 --> 01:39:02.639 align:start position:0%
currently certainly not a practice that
 
01:39:05.790 --> 01:39:05.800 align:start position:0%
we do and if you go on page four line 10
 
01:39:08.550 --> 01:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
of the current bill it's lined out but
 
01:39:09.910 --> 01:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
and I think the gentleman before me
 
01:39:12.350 --> 01:39:12.360 align:start position:0%
pointed it out the state will need to
 
01:39:14.870 --> 01:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
prove that Verma in this case was a
 
01:39:17.229 --> 01:39:17.239 align:start position:0%
consenting party to the fonus violation
 
01:39:19.030 --> 01:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
and had knowledge of it so we're not
 
01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:20.510 align:start position:0%
and had knowledge of it so we're not
taking

01:39:20.510 --> 01:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
taking
 
01:39:22.910 --> 01:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
people's property that is completely
 
01:39:24.750 --> 01:39:24.760 align:start position:0%
innocent and not a party to any of these
 
01:39:27.390 --> 01:39:27.400 align:start position:0%
crimes that just I I just that is not
 
01:39:29.629 --> 01:39:29.639 align:start position:0%
correct um that doesn't happen and it's
 
01:39:33.189 --> 01:39:33.199 align:start position:0%
not something that we do uh the other
 
01:39:36.550 --> 01:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
talk about the amounts so that is
 
01:39:37.910 --> 01:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
accurate we do not I do not submit
 
01:39:39.109 --> 01:39:39.119 align:start position:0%
anything below
 
01:39:43.709 --> 01:39:43.719 align:start position:0%
,000 um but I heard some talk that a
 
01:39:45.669 --> 01:39:45.679 align:start position:0%
drug kingpin won't be driving around in
 
01:39:48.189 --> 01:39:48.199 align:start position:0%
a sort of beat up car with a couple
 
01:39:51.310 --> 01:39:51.320 align:start position:0%
thousand bucks or below that no they
 
01:39:53.950 --> 01:39:53.960 align:start position:0%
won't but the people that I referenced
 
01:39:55.310 --> 01:39:55.320 align:start position:0%
earlier they're Runners the people that
 
01:39:57.750 --> 01:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
they employ to sell their drugs as part
 
01:40:00.629 --> 01:40:00.639 align:start position:0%
of the organization will they will drive
 
01:40:02.390 --> 01:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
around and we just had a seizure
 
01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:05.550 align:start position:0%
around and we just had a seizure
recently

01:40:05.550 --> 01:40:05.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:08.790 --> 01:40:08.800 align:start position:0%
of almost a quarter of a kilo of product
 
01:40:11.390 --> 01:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
with less than $1,000 doll because what
 
01:40:14.430 --> 01:40:14.440 align:start position:0%
they do is they send them out they do
 
01:40:16.390 --> 01:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
their sales for the day they come back
 
01:40:18.070 --> 01:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
they drop it at a either a stash house
 
01:40:19.709 --> 01:40:19.719 align:start position:0%
or a stash location they pick up more
 
01:40:23.470 --> 01:40:23.480 align:start position:0%
product they continue their sales so
 
01:40:26.070 --> 01:40:26.080 align:start position:0%
the fact that $ thousand doll or so is
 
01:40:27.750 --> 01:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
is the limit doesn't necessarily mean
 
01:40:30.629 --> 01:40:30.639 align:start position:0%
we're targeting or going after very low
 
01:40:33.550 --> 01:40:33.560 align:start position:0%
value users that is not the practice
 
01:40:35.189 --> 01:40:35.199 align:start position:0%
that we use and that's that's kind of I
 
01:40:37.070 --> 01:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
think where that thousand limit comes
 
01:40:38.589 --> 01:40:38.599 align:start position:0%
from it might it certainly I could
 
01:40:40.109 --> 01:40:40.119 align:start position:0%
understand representative Bion that it
 
01:40:42.430 --> 01:40:42.440 align:start position:0%
seems quite low but that's sort of where
 
01:40:46.709 --> 01:40:46.719 align:start position:0%
we get the the idea of it is so it can
 
01:40:50.550 --> 01:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
be fair to sees amounts around $1,000
 
01:40:52.709 --> 01:40:52.719 align:start position:0%
that's where that comes from um so in
 
01:40:54.950 --> 01:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
closing I
 
01:40:56.629 --> 01:40:56.639 align:start position:0%
hope we find that the committee would
 
01:40:58.070 --> 01:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
find this bill an expedient to legislate
 
01:41:00.709 --> 01:41:00.719 align:start position:0%
for those reasons um a lot of the talk
 
01:41:03.430 --> 01:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
about the
 
01:41:05.709 --> 01:41:05.719 align:start position:0%
uh um legislative portion is a little
 
01:41:06.990 --> 01:41:07.000 align:start position:0%
bit out of my purview so I can't really
 
01:41:08.709 --> 01:41:08.719 align:start position:0%
speak to that I will certainly leave
 
01:41:12.830 --> 01:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
that to you and folks who are more well
 
01:41:15.390 --> 01:41:15.400 align:start position:0%
versed in that but um I'll be happy to
 
01:41:17.550 --> 01:41:17.560 align:start position:0%
take any questions representative
 
01:41:20.870 --> 01:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
McFarland thank you Mr chairman so just
 
01:41:22.910 --> 01:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
to follow up on on what you were saying
 
01:41:25.910 --> 01:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
at the end there uh and and if we assume
 
01:41:27.629 --> 01:41:27.639 align:start position:0%
for the sake of discussion that the
 
01:41:29.629 --> 01:41:29.639 align:start position:0%
limits specified in the bill are
 
01:41:31.030 --> 01:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate and it sounds like they're
 
01:41:33.229 --> 01:41:33.239 align:start position:0%
in line as representative Maguire was
 
01:41:35.390 --> 01:41:35.400 align:start position:0%
asserting with your current
 
01:41:39.629 --> 01:41:39.639 align:start position:0%
practice can you explain to me where you
 
01:41:41.910 --> 01:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
I think just laid out for us that it is
 
01:41:44.790 --> 01:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
common place for these criminals
 
01:41:46.910 --> 01:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
presumably being well aware of some of
 
01:41:50.550 --> 01:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
the limits in question to make a point
 
01:41:54.030 --> 01:41:54.040 align:start position:0%
of only carrying less than $1,000
 
01:41:56.149 --> 01:41:56.159 align:start position:0%
uh that that that is their their common
 
01:41:58.470 --> 01:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
practice and yet you're saying you only
 
01:42:01.430 --> 01:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
address the over $1,000 circumstance uh
 
01:42:03.870 --> 01:42:03.880 align:start position:0%
in your current forfeitures how do those
 
01:42:06.189 --> 01:42:06.199 align:start position:0%
two comport I mean I where wherever we
 
01:42:08.189 --> 01:42:08.199 align:start position:0%
set that number it sounds to me like
 
01:42:11.510 --> 01:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
what you're telling us is that the um
 
01:42:14.750 --> 01:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
that the actors who are not uh who don't
 
01:42:16.750 --> 01:42:16.760 align:start position:0%
really have Criminal Intent may be
 
01:42:19.229 --> 01:42:19.239 align:start position:0%
carrying any amount of funds whereas the
 
01:42:21.149 --> 01:42:21.159 align:start position:0%
the real criminals are going to stay
 
01:42:24.510 --> 01:42:24.520 align:start position:0%
below that threshold no matter what
 
01:42:25.950 --> 01:42:25.960 align:start position:0%
so I wouldn't say that it's a practice
 
01:42:27.830 --> 01:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
for them to carry under that I was just
 
01:42:30.629 --> 01:42:30.639 align:start position:0%
using that example as that person so the
 
01:42:33.070 --> 01:42:33.080 align:start position:0%
person that we sees just under a th000
 
01:42:34.589 --> 01:42:34.599 align:start position:0%
still had a large amount of product on
 
01:42:36.430 --> 01:42:36.440 align:start position:0%
them so they would have sold well over a
 
01:42:38.229 --> 01:42:38.239 align:start position:0%
th000 probably into the 2 to 3,000 range
 
01:42:40.270 --> 01:42:40.280 align:start position:0%
I was just saying in that General range
 
01:42:42.229 --> 01:42:42.239 align:start position:0%
that's why it's around there because
 
01:42:44.310 --> 01:42:44.320 align:start position:0%
even though you know it is a fair
 
01:42:46.149 --> 01:42:46.159 align:start position:0%
assumption for someone who's not
 
01:42:47.430 --> 01:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
familiar with kind of these
 
01:42:48.870 --> 01:42:48.880 align:start position:0%
organizations how they practice well
 
01:42:51.189 --> 01:42:51.199 align:start position:0%
that why would you know a large dealer a
 
01:42:52.990 --> 01:42:53.000 align:start position:0%
large organization carry so little I
 
01:42:54.390 --> 01:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
think it's for the exact reason one they
 
01:42:56.310 --> 01:42:56.320 align:start position:0%
don't want to get robbed and lose a lot
 
01:42:58.030 --> 01:42:58.040 align:start position:0%
of money they don't want to have law
 
01:43:00.470 --> 01:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement stop and lose a lot of money
 
01:43:03.510 --> 01:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
so setting it where it is I think is a
 
01:43:05.430 --> 01:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
reasonable amount where we're kind of
 
01:43:07.510 --> 01:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
putting out the users who might have a
 
01:43:09.750 --> 01:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
couple hundred bucks on them maybe um
 
01:43:12.030 --> 01:43:12.040 align:start position:0%
looking to buy a few
 
01:43:16.189 --> 01:43:16.199 align:start position:0%
grams but keeping it a threshold where
 
01:43:19.430 --> 01:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
it's those traffickers who use Runners
 
01:43:22.830 --> 01:43:22.840 align:start position:0%
we can still effectively seize the seize
 
01:43:25.390 --> 01:43:25.400 align:start position:0%
uh currency from them thank you
 
01:43:25.400 --> 01:43:28.070 align:start position:0%
uh currency from them thank you
representative

01:43:28.070 --> 01:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:31.310 --> 01:43:31.320 align:start position:0%
rmo you representative rbo yes yeah nope
 
01:43:33.270 --> 01:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you and thank you for taking
 
01:43:35.229 --> 01:43:35.239 align:start position:0%
my question um to your comments about
 
01:43:36.990 --> 01:43:37.000 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and the concerns about the
 
01:43:39.470 --> 01:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
impact from drugs in Massachusetts in
 
01:43:42.470 --> 01:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um are you aware of or can
 
01:43:44.109 --> 01:43:44.119 align:start position:0%
you share any information to other
 
01:43:46.390 --> 01:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
states maybe who have had differences in
 
01:43:48.990 --> 01:43:49.000 align:start position:0%
their for fiter systems or made changes
 
01:43:50.669 --> 01:43:50.679 align:start position:0%
in those legislations how that may have
 
01:43:54.550 --> 01:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
impacted um moving the sort of the drug
 
01:43:58.030 --> 01:43:58.040 align:start position:0%
trafficking Focus to a neighboring
 
01:44:01.589 --> 01:44:01.599 align:start position:0%
state I can't I don't um I just
 
01:44:03.550 --> 01:44:03.560 align:start position:0%
basically going off of our current
 
01:44:06.109 --> 01:44:06.119 align:start position:0%
situation and a lot of assumptions based
 
01:44:07.390 --> 01:44:07.400 align:start position:0%
on human behavior I don't have any
 
01:44:09.109 --> 01:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
specific it wasn't wasn't intended as a
 
01:44:10.189 --> 01:44:10.199 align:start position:0%
trick question I'm just curious to see
 
01:44:12.990 --> 01:44:13.000 align:start position:0%
if other states had dealt with that that
 
01:44:14.589 --> 01:44:14.599 align:start position:0%
shift right no I think it's a very fair
 
01:44:16.470 --> 01:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
question and uh thanks yeah I would be
 
01:44:17.790 --> 01:44:17.800 align:start position:0%
curious myself to look into that now
 
01:44:19.310 --> 01:44:19.320 align:start position:0%
thank you m thank
 
01:44:22.550 --> 01:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
you any other questions seeing none
 
01:44:26.550 --> 01:44:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:31.390 --> 01:44:31.400 align:start position:0%
Tim MC is it m m
 
01:44:31.400 --> 01:44:34.669 align:start position:0%
Tim MC is it m m
okay

01:44:34.669 --> 01:44:34.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:43.830 --> 01:44:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:43.840 --> 01:44:46.189 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:44:46.189 --> 01:44:46.199 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:44:51.070 --> 01:44:51.080 align:start position:0%
okay oh one more time there you go okay
 
01:44:52.470 --> 01:44:52.480 align:start position:0%
thank you committee members for hearing
 
01:44:53.629 --> 01:44:53.639 align:start position:0%
my testimony
 
01:44:55.350 --> 01:44:55.360 align:start position:0%
my name is uh Timothy macac I am a
 
01:44:56.870 --> 01:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
lieutenant with the Nashville Police
 
01:44:59.030 --> 01:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
Department I've been there for about 21
 
01:45:01.830 --> 01:45:01.840 align:start position:0%
years now um just as far as a little
 
01:45:03.070 --> 01:45:03.080 align:start position:0%
background I apologize I didn't have a
 
01:45:05.270 --> 01:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
handout for everyone uh I can certainly
 
01:45:07.270 --> 01:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
email that and have it forwarded to you
 
01:45:10.270 --> 01:45:10.280 align:start position:0%
uh for your review um I I won't belabor
 
01:45:12.790 --> 01:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
the point I'm to touch on um a lot of
 
01:45:15.149 --> 01:45:15.159 align:start position:0%
the same points and mostly the the the
 
01:45:16.470 --> 01:45:16.480 align:start position:0%
more factual points that I was concerned
 
01:45:18.629 --> 01:45:18.639 align:start position:0%
with in opposition to this bill um that
 
01:45:20.830 --> 01:45:20.840 align:start position:0%
Lieutenant Cataldo um eloquently spoke
 
01:45:24.149 --> 01:45:24.159 align:start position:0%
on um was the uh removal of certain
 
01:45:26.870 --> 01:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
verbiage in the um current statute or
 
01:45:29.229 --> 01:45:29.239 align:start position:0%
current law that allows for us to um
 
01:45:31.750 --> 01:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
seize funds that are within proximity to
 
01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:32.910 align:start position:0%
seize funds that are within proximity to
Controlled

01:45:32.910 --> 01:45:32.920 align:start position:0%
Controlled
 
01:45:35.870 --> 01:45:35.880 align:start position:0%
Substances uh while that being a minor
 
01:45:37.709 --> 01:45:37.719 align:start position:0%
alteration of the verbage that exists in
 
01:45:40.510 --> 01:45:40.520 align:start position:0%
the current law and changing it to um
 
01:45:43.189 --> 01:45:43.199 align:start position:0%
what it is now um I can't understate the
 
01:45:45.270 --> 01:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
point of like what Lieutenant catalo
 
01:45:47.310 --> 01:45:47.320 align:start position:0%
previously testified to is that often
 
01:45:48.950 --> 01:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
drug dealers
 
01:45:51.550 --> 01:45:51.560 align:start position:0%
um uh you know have cash on hand and
 
01:45:53.629 --> 01:45:53.639 align:start position:0%
have them those those funds call Le in
 
01:45:55.510 --> 01:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
in their in their business uh it is a
 
01:45:57.149 --> 01:45:57.159 align:start position:0%
cash business and it's it's quite
 
01:45:59.430 --> 01:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
profitable um I think if by changing
 
01:46:02.149 --> 01:46:02.159 align:start position:0%
that verbiage it would allow for um
 
01:46:03.830 --> 01:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
officers to be to impair their
 
01:46:05.669 --> 01:46:05.679 align:start position:0%
investigations to seize funds when they
 
01:46:07.189 --> 01:46:07.199 align:start position:0%
believe it is involved in an
 
01:46:07.199 --> 01:46:08.950 align:start position:0%
believe it is involved in an
investigation

01:46:08.950 --> 01:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
01:46:11.990 --> 01:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
um when they're uh you know in the
 
01:46:13.790 --> 01:46:13.800 align:start position:0%
course of an interdiction stop or
 
01:46:15.470 --> 01:46:15.480 align:start position:0%
long-term investigation if we come
 
01:46:18.430 --> 01:46:18.440 align:start position:0%
across large um large amounts of cash it
 
01:46:20.430 --> 01:46:20.440 align:start position:0%
is typical that we would seize it and
 
01:46:22.430 --> 01:46:22.440 align:start position:0%
and continue our investigation like uh
 
01:46:24.950 --> 01:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
lieutenant talo stated um we're not
 
01:46:27.310 --> 01:46:27.320 align:start position:0%
within the um we continue our
 
01:46:29.709 --> 01:46:29.719 align:start position:0%
investigation even once it's seized um
 
01:46:31.910 --> 01:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
and we obviously when a defendant or
 
01:46:33.310 --> 01:46:33.320 align:start position:0%
someone an involved party that could be
 
01:46:35.070 --> 01:46:35.080 align:start position:0%
caught up in an investigation can offer
 
01:46:37.229 --> 01:46:37.239 align:start position:0%
proof that their uh the funds that we
 
01:46:39.990 --> 01:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
seize or the assets we take are believed
 
01:46:42.750 --> 01:46:42.760 align:start position:0%
to be um not illg gotten and not illicit
 
01:46:44.870 --> 01:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
we certainly are um can take take that
 
01:46:46.149 --> 01:46:46.159 align:start position:0%
as part of the investigation and return
 
01:46:48.189 --> 01:46:48.199 align:start position:0%
items when they are necessary uh we
 
01:46:50.229 --> 01:46:50.239 align:start position:0%
proceed in the into proceedings when we
 
01:46:51.550 --> 01:46:51.560 align:start position:0%
don't feel like they are that is
 
01:46:52.910 --> 01:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
legitimate and that they are ill gotten
 
01:46:55.550 --> 01:46:55.560 align:start position:0%
gains and illicit means um the reason
 
01:46:57.589 --> 01:46:57.599 align:start position:0%
why um obviously asset forfeiture has
 
01:46:59.229 --> 01:46:59.239 align:start position:0%
been established is to take away that
 
01:47:02.790 --> 01:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
funding mechanism for um drug drug
 
01:47:04.709 --> 01:47:04.719 align:start position:0%
dealers and make it a less fruitful
 
01:47:06.790 --> 01:47:06.800 align:start position:0%
Endeavor uh additionally it helps
 
01:47:09.350 --> 01:47:09.360 align:start position:0%
dismantle these organizations that have
 
01:47:11.669 --> 01:47:11.679 align:start position:0%
um webs of people working for them and
 
01:47:13.950 --> 01:47:13.960 align:start position:0%
makes it so that they can't reestablish
 
01:47:16.229 --> 01:47:16.239 align:start position:0%
easily um by working it through the
 
01:47:18.109 --> 01:47:18.119 align:start position:0%
current system we have I believe there
 
01:47:20.390 --> 01:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
checks and balances um for within our
 
01:47:24.510 --> 01:47:24.520 align:start position:0%
agency we um often when we take assets
 
01:47:26.750 --> 01:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
we do so with a concerted effort to have
 
01:47:29.149 --> 01:47:29.159 align:start position:0%
all the facts at hand and and do so and
 
01:47:30.709 --> 01:47:30.719 align:start position:0%
it it lets it play out through the the
 
01:47:32.390 --> 01:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
court process and have due process
 
01:47:34.149 --> 01:47:34.159 align:start position:0%
afforded to the person who we take the
 
01:47:37.189 --> 01:47:37.199 align:start position:0%
assets from um I'm not aware of any
 
01:47:38.470 --> 01:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
situation that was kind of slightly
 
01:47:39.750 --> 01:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
characterized by some of the previous
 
01:47:42.589 --> 01:47:42.599 align:start position:0%
testimony that um we're taking uh
 
01:47:44.310 --> 01:47:44.320 align:start position:0%
Grandma's K and trying to take that
 
01:47:45.830 --> 01:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
without a without a common sense
 
01:47:48.189 --> 01:47:48.199 align:start position:0%
approach to the matter um I can't think
 
01:47:50.430 --> 01:47:50.440 align:start position:0%
of a h situation on hand that in my time
 
01:47:52.830 --> 01:47:52.840 align:start position:0%
at the police department that we've um
 
01:47:54.629 --> 01:47:54.639 align:start position:0%
someone who's been victimized by our
 
01:47:57.550 --> 01:47:57.560 align:start position:0%
practice of seizure of assets um
 
01:47:58.669 --> 01:47:58.679 align:start position:0%
certainly there may be people who
 
01:48:00.390 --> 01:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
disagree with that but I I certainly can
 
01:48:02.109 --> 01:48:02.119 align:start position:0%
speak to my own knowledge of the
 
01:48:04.589 --> 01:48:04.599 align:start position:0%
situation um without belaboring the
 
01:48:08.109 --> 01:48:08.119 align:start position:0%
point um I do feel that the current uh
 
01:48:11.149 --> 01:48:11.159 align:start position:0%
while that line item from line 18 to 21
 
01:48:13.070 --> 01:48:13.080 align:start position:0%
that's been lined out which refer I'm
 
01:48:17.109 --> 01:48:17.119 align:start position:0%
referring to as the um proximity removal
 
01:48:19.270 --> 01:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
um that is the uh from my standpoint is
 
01:48:20.750 --> 01:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
from law enforcement the most
 
01:48:23.070 --> 01:48:23.080 align:start position:0%
significant change that would affect us
 
01:48:25.550 --> 01:48:25.560 align:start position:0%
um on a day-to-day basis and how we uh
 
01:48:28.070 --> 01:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
attack the drug traffickers that do um
 
01:48:30.390 --> 01:48:30.400 align:start position:0%
work within New Hampshire um the rest of
 
01:48:32.430 --> 01:48:32.440 align:start position:0%
the the legal proceedings and as far as
 
01:48:34.430 --> 01:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
the changes I can't speak to the Court's
 
01:48:36.910 --> 01:48:36.920 align:start position:0%
um capacity or abilities to handle that
 
01:48:39.830 --> 01:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
and what legally is appropriate but um
 
01:48:41.990 --> 01:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
obviously that's uh within the your guys
 
01:48:46.229 --> 01:48:46.239 align:start position:0%
purview to um make those assumptions and
 
01:48:50.109 --> 01:48:50.119 align:start position:0%
determinations thank you any questions
 
01:48:52.510 --> 01:48:52.520 align:start position:0%
representative Manos thank you Mr chair
 
01:48:54.470 --> 01:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question
 
01:48:57.030 --> 01:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
when assets are ultimately
 
01:48:59.870 --> 01:48:59.880 align:start position:0%
forfeited do you know where the either
 
01:49:03.669 --> 01:49:03.679 align:start position:0%
the cash or the asset goes where does
 
01:49:08.350 --> 01:49:08.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:11.310 --> 01:49:11.320 align:start position:0%
know uh typically when we take an asset
 
01:49:12.870 --> 01:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
we obiously go through the procedure
 
01:49:14.550 --> 01:49:14.560 align:start position:0%
with the Attorney General's office the
 
01:49:16.270 --> 01:49:16.280 align:start position:0%
money is held in our evidence until it's
 
01:49:19.070 --> 01:49:19.080 align:start position:0%
transferred to their custody um if it's
 
01:49:22.070 --> 01:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
a vehicle say we're we we hold it at our
 
01:49:24.750 --> 01:49:24.760 align:start position:0%
facility and we maintain uh uh an
 
01:49:26.070 --> 01:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
OverWatch of it to ensure that it
 
01:49:27.830 --> 01:49:27.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't diminish it like for instance a
 
01:49:29.709 --> 01:49:29.719 align:start position:0%
common one would be a vehicle um we
 
01:49:31.310 --> 01:49:31.320 align:start position:0%
maintain OverWatch of that by our
 
01:49:32.790 --> 01:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
procedure to ensure that it doesn't
 
01:49:36.669 --> 01:49:36.679 align:start position:0%
diminish in value um it is a um Vehicles
 
01:49:38.950 --> 01:49:38.960 align:start position:0%
aren't taken by us generally as a matter
 
01:49:42.189 --> 01:49:42.199 align:start position:0%
of um ease because typically values the
 
01:49:43.790 --> 01:49:43.800 align:start position:0%
vehicle values we're we're seizing
 
01:49:46.390 --> 01:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
aren't of Great Value and they're often
 
01:49:48.669 --> 01:49:48.679 align:start position:0%
um uh kind of labor intensive to
 
01:49:51.470 --> 01:49:51.480 align:start position:0%
maintain and um stay with to be have to
 
01:49:53.430 --> 01:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
keep them current and as a labor uh
 
01:49:55.229 --> 01:49:55.239 align:start position:0%
Manpower involvement in that to keep our
 
01:49:56.990 --> 01:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
mechanics from having to start them
 
01:49:58.669 --> 01:49:58.679 align:start position:0%
regularly check them make sure they're
 
01:50:00.830 --> 01:50:00.840 align:start position:0%
still um operational so we're not
 
01:50:02.510 --> 01:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
diminishing that asset because neverita
 
01:50:04.709 --> 01:50:04.719 align:start position:0%
know we know the court process proceeds
 
01:50:06.270 --> 01:50:06.280 align:start position:0%
and there's it's not a guarantee or
 
01:50:07.750 --> 01:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
anything for certain that we will be
 
01:50:11.470 --> 01:50:11.480 align:start position:0%
getting that asset as a uh as a
 
01:50:14.430 --> 01:50:14.440 align:start position:0%
seizure followup thank you and thank you
 
01:50:16.950 --> 01:50:16.960 align:start position:0%
for taking my followup do you know
 
01:50:19.350 --> 01:50:19.360 align:start position:0%
whether the money ultimately goes back
 
01:50:21.350 --> 01:50:21.360 align:start position:0%
it goes to the Attorney General's office
 
01:50:23.270 --> 01:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
apparently but does it ultimately go
 
01:50:25.830 --> 01:50:25.840 align:start position:0%
back to fund police departments do you
 
01:50:27.149 --> 01:50:27.159 align:start position:0%
do you
 
01:50:29.950 --> 01:50:29.960 align:start position:0%
know uh yes the um a portion of the
 
01:50:31.390 --> 01:50:31.400 align:start position:0%
funds as determined by the Attorney
 
01:50:33.109 --> 01:50:33.119 align:start position:0%
General's office in the current law will
 
01:50:34.790 --> 01:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
come back to the police department and
 
01:50:37.030 --> 01:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
it will go into an asset forfeiture fund
 
01:50:39.070 --> 01:50:39.080 align:start position:0%
uh at the police
 
01:50:42.629 --> 01:50:42.639 align:start position:0%
department representative horon um thank
 
01:50:45.589 --> 01:50:45.599 align:start position:0%
you very much um we we've heard a lot of
 
01:50:47.669 --> 01:50:47.679 align:start position:0%
talk about Massachusetts and as you know
 
01:50:50.350 --> 01:50:50.360 align:start position:0%
uh NASA and tinbo Massachusetts are
 
01:50:52.310 --> 01:50:52.320 align:start position:0%
divided by pretty much an arbitrary line
 
01:50:55.510 --> 01:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
drawing in the map so are there
 
01:50:57.350 --> 01:50:57.360 align:start position:0%
suppliers in New Hampshire who are
 
01:50:59.189 --> 01:50:59.199 align:start position:0%
selling into Massachusetts so is this
 
01:51:00.870 --> 01:51:00.880 align:start position:0%
just in the context of a regional market
 
01:51:02.750 --> 01:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
or is it actually like the suppliers are
 
01:51:04.030 --> 01:51:04.040 align:start position:0%
one side of the state line and the
 
01:51:06.470 --> 01:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
customers are on the other
 
01:51:09.750 --> 01:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
so I will say that it is is twofold we
 
01:51:11.629 --> 01:51:11.639 align:start position:0%
are um we are very close to
 
01:51:13.390 --> 01:51:13.400 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and we are very close to
 
01:51:15.510 --> 01:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
Lawrence Massachusetts which is uh is a
 
01:51:18.109 --> 01:51:18.119 align:start position:0%
designated Source city of Narcotics um I
 
01:51:20.270 --> 01:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
would say if not all but most of our
 
01:51:21.629 --> 01:51:21.639 align:start position:0%
narcotics do come from Lawrence
 
01:51:23.310 --> 01:51:23.320 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts by or
 
01:51:25.430 --> 01:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
um it is a combination of dealers coming
 
01:51:28.109 --> 01:51:28.119 align:start position:0%
into the state to deal and also um local
 
01:51:29.550 --> 01:51:29.560 align:start position:0%
dealers traveling down to Lawrence
 
01:51:31.310 --> 01:51:31.320 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts picking up a large
 
01:51:33.229 --> 01:51:33.239 align:start position:0%
quantity and bringing it back and it's
 
01:51:35.830 --> 01:51:35.840 align:start position:0%
often um an example provided earlier was
 
01:51:38.390 --> 01:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
a drug and addiction stop where um a
 
01:51:39.669 --> 01:51:39.679 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle infraction and a
 
01:51:41.990 --> 01:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
subsequent investigation unfolds based
 
01:51:43.750 --> 01:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
upon observations of officers and
 
01:51:46.350 --> 01:51:46.360 align:start position:0%
investigators and often sometimes when
 
01:51:48.030 --> 01:51:48.040 align:start position:0%
we come across quantities of cash and
 
01:51:50.310 --> 01:51:50.320 align:start position:0%
drugs coalescing together in a vehicle
 
01:51:52.189 --> 01:51:52.199 align:start position:0%
um it is sometimes throw investigations
 
01:51:53.470 --> 01:51:53.480 align:start position:0%
to be find that these people are are
 
01:51:55.589 --> 01:51:55.599 align:start position:0%
traveling immediately from um either
 
01:51:57.149 --> 01:51:57.159 align:start position:0%
Lawrence Massachusetts or going down to
 
01:51:58.589 --> 01:51:58.599 align:start position:0%
Lawrence Massachusetts to purchase
 
01:52:02.069 --> 01:52:02.079 align:start position:0%
narcotics or uh return to Nash to
 
01:52:05.350 --> 01:52:05.360 align:start position:0%
sell thanks any other questions
 
01:52:05.360 --> 01:52:07.069 align:start position:0%
sell thanks any other questions
representative

01:52:07.069 --> 01:52:07.079 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:52:10.430 --> 01:52:10.440 align:start position:0%
trip thank you Mr chair U thank you for
 
01:52:13.870 --> 01:52:13.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question sir uh so if they're
 
01:52:17.189 --> 01:52:17.199 align:start position:0%
going down to Massachusetts to buy their
 
01:52:19.750 --> 01:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
product I I would assume that they have
 
01:52:23.310 --> 01:52:23.320 align:start position:0%
a fairly large amount of money but they
 
01:52:26.550 --> 01:52:26.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have any product at that time
 
01:52:30.270 --> 01:52:30.280 align:start position:0%
you know how does that work out in your
 
01:52:30.280 --> 01:52:33.229 align:start position:0%
you know how does that work out in your
uh

01:52:33.229 --> 01:52:33.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:52:35.149 --> 01:52:35.159 align:start position:0%
investigations it could be a variety of
 
01:52:37.709 --> 01:52:37.719 align:start position:0%
reasons um certain dealers operate in
 
01:52:40.510 --> 01:52:40.520 align:start position:0%
different ways um some uh some dealers
 
01:52:42.550 --> 01:52:42.560 align:start position:0%
are they bring down they buy a certain
 
01:52:43.910 --> 01:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
quantity of a certain drug but they may
 
01:52:46.270 --> 01:52:46.280 align:start position:0%
have another drug in their possession um
 
01:52:49.229 --> 01:52:49.239 align:start position:0%
often we're seeing a lot of U Fentanyl
 
01:52:52.189 --> 01:52:52.199 align:start position:0%
and methamphetamines um in NASA now and
 
01:52:54.149 --> 01:52:54.159 align:start position:0%
they kind of operate the deals typically
 
01:52:56.390 --> 01:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
operate within those two two two two
 
01:52:59.069 --> 01:52:59.079 align:start position:0%
drugs quite a bit um so they they
 
01:53:00.870 --> 01:53:00.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes their sources are different um
 
01:53:03.470 --> 01:53:03.480 align:start position:0%
different locations um sometimes they
 
01:53:06.310 --> 01:53:06.320 align:start position:0%
are uh in the course of them conducting
 
01:53:08.510 --> 01:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
sales they are traveling returning to
 
01:53:10.870 --> 01:53:10.880 align:start position:0%
their eventual say home base if you will
 
01:53:12.109 --> 01:53:12.119 align:start position:0%
so they could go down and pick up a
 
01:53:14.229 --> 01:53:14.239 align:start position:0%
quantity and be traveling throughout
 
01:53:16.310 --> 01:53:16.320 align:start position:0%
different locations in Nashville where
 
01:53:17.950 --> 01:53:17.960 align:start position:0%
um we come across them in our
 
01:53:20.830 --> 01:53:20.840 align:start position:0%
investigations and they have
 
01:53:23.910 --> 01:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
qu I don't have any pink cards for that
 
01:53:25.270 --> 01:53:25.280 align:start position:0%
bills anyone here that wishes to speak
 
01:53:25.280 --> 01:53:37.709 align:start position:0%
bills anyone here that wishes to speak
on

01:53:37.709 --> 01:53:37.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:42.310 --> 01:53:42.320 align:start position:0%
it our representative papil
 
01:53:44.790 --> 01:53:44.800 align:start position:0%
mu thank you very much Mr chair and
 
01:53:47.350 --> 01:53:47.360 align:start position:0%
members of the committee as a co-sponsor
 
01:53:49.310 --> 01:53:49.320 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to take a couple of
 
01:53:51.189 --> 01:53:51.199 align:start position:0%
minutes to quickly go through a couple
 
01:53:53.109 --> 01:53:53.119 align:start position:0%
of the topics that came up during the
 
01:53:55.629 --> 01:53:55.639 align:start position:0%
discussion of this bill I I'm going to
 
01:53:57.149 --> 01:53:57.159 align:start position:0%
try not to repeat anything that was
 
01:54:00.430 --> 01:54:00.440 align:start position:0%
already said because once is enough um
 
01:54:01.950 --> 01:54:01.960 align:start position:0%
we had questions about the impact on
 
01:54:04.390 --> 01:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
public defenders I hope that by now it's
 
01:54:07.030 --> 01:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
pretty clear how minimal that is I do
 
01:54:09.149 --> 01:54:09.159 align:start position:0%
not believe that one person who needs a
 
01:54:10.950 --> 01:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
civil defender in a criminal case would
 
01:54:13.669 --> 01:54:13.679 align:start position:0%
be unable to obtain it because of the
 
01:54:16.629 --> 01:54:16.639 align:start position:0%
minimal strain put by including this
 
01:54:18.189 --> 01:54:18.199 align:start position:0%
civil proceeding at the end of a
 
01:54:20.990 --> 01:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
criminal case it it is literally a very
 
01:54:22.870 --> 01:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
very minimal amount of time and effort
 
01:54:24.669 --> 01:54:24.679 align:start position:0%
that be required and it should not put a
 
01:54:26.069 --> 01:54:26.079 align:start position:0%
strain on the
 
01:54:29.430 --> 01:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
system um we've spoken about the fact
 
01:54:31.069 --> 01:54:31.079 align:start position:0%
that U you know there are minimum
 
01:54:33.589 --> 01:54:33.599 align:start position:0%
amounts in this bill they are quite low
 
01:54:35.069 --> 01:54:35.079 align:start position:0%
again in a different state that has
 
01:54:38.350 --> 01:54:38.360 align:start position:0%
fewer protections we would maybe fight
 
01:54:40.270 --> 01:54:40.280 align:start position:0%
for more in this case I think the
 
01:54:43.510 --> 01:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
current levels work fine I just want to
 
01:54:47.709 --> 01:54:47.719 align:start position:0%
address one significant objection to
 
01:54:51.069 --> 01:54:51.079 align:start position:0%
this bill from our uh law enforcement uh
 
01:54:53.350 --> 01:54:53.360 align:start position:0%
testimony which which is the uh change
 
01:54:55.229 --> 01:54:55.239 align:start position:0%
of presumption for uh you know the for
 
01:54:56.550 --> 01:54:56.560 align:start position:0%
feature of cash found in drug
 
01:54:58.550 --> 01:54:58.560 align:start position:0%
investigations where this bill would
 
01:55:01.550 --> 01:55:01.560 align:start position:0%
allow would would require the you know
 
01:55:03.990 --> 01:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
we would put the burden on proof on the
 
01:55:08.069 --> 01:55:08.079 align:start position:0%
prosecutors to approve that look I have
 
01:55:09.790 --> 01:55:09.800 align:start position:0%
full confidence in the ability of our
 
01:55:11.510 --> 01:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
law enforcement to prove that you know
 
01:55:13.149 --> 01:55:13.159 align:start position:0%
the tens of thousands and hundreds of
 
01:55:14.430 --> 01:55:14.440 align:start position:0%
thousands they are typically
 
01:55:16.870 --> 01:55:16.880 align:start position:0%
confiscating at the end of long
 
01:55:18.910 --> 01:55:18.920 align:start position:0%
investigations into drug organizations
 
01:55:20.990 --> 01:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
or proceeds of criminal activity the
 
01:55:23.270 --> 01:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
bill still allows for ple bar
 
01:55:25.589 --> 01:55:25.599 align:start position:0%
that may include keeping the confiscated
 
01:55:29.149 --> 01:55:29.159 align:start position:0%
property and so on but if this becomes
 
01:55:31.030 --> 01:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
the sticking point for this committee I
 
01:55:33.669 --> 01:55:33.679 align:start position:0%
would submit to you that even if you
 
01:55:35.069 --> 01:55:35.079 align:start position:0%
decide to take
 
01:55:37.830 --> 01:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
that minor part away of it even though
 
01:55:39.390 --> 01:55:39.400 align:start position:0%
it's an important part to me and I would
 
01:55:42.430 --> 01:55:42.440 align:start position:0%
encourage you to keep it the rest of the
 
01:55:45.229 --> 01:55:45.239 align:start position:0%
bill is absolutely worth an OTP because
 
01:55:47.510 --> 01:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
it addresses significant burdens and it
 
01:55:49.990 --> 01:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
will make life easier for the court
 
01:55:52.390 --> 01:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
system for the prosecutors and for for
 
01:55:54.589 --> 01:55:54.599 align:start position:0%

01:56:17.910 --> 01:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill

papichi mu to oh representative Dan magu
 
01:56:26.790 --> 01:56:26.800 align:start position:0%
to introduce
 
01:56:29.430 --> 01:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
it thank you very much Mr chairman and
 
01:56:30.709 --> 01:56:30.719 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
01:56:33.830 --> 01:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
my name is Dan Maguire and um I'm from
 
01:56:35.589 --> 01:56:35.599 align:start position:0%
the town of Epsom and I'd like to
 
01:56:37.390 --> 01:56:37.400 align:start position:0%
introduce House Bill
 
01:56:39.870 --> 01:56:39.880 align:start position:0%
509 as we talked about just on the
 
01:56:44.669 --> 01:56:44.679 align:start position:0%
previous bill um the amount of um
 
01:56:48.629 --> 01:56:48.639 align:start position:0%
reporting of of asset forfeiture is is
 
01:56:53.830 --> 01:56:53.840 align:start position:0%
fairly minimal um and uh this bill
 
01:56:57.189 --> 01:56:57.199 align:start position:0%
adds many specific sort of fields if you
 
01:56:59.069 --> 01:56:59.079 align:start position:0%
want to think of this as a you know
 
01:57:01.069 --> 01:57:01.079 align:start position:0%
getting a spreadsheet or a table or
 
01:57:03.510 --> 01:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
something like that so this this bill
 
01:57:07.750 --> 01:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
would add um much more detail about each
 
01:57:09.430 --> 01:57:09.440 align:start position:0%
specific kind of
 
01:57:11.870 --> 01:57:11.880 align:start position:0%
forfeiture uh what was the value what
 
01:57:14.510 --> 01:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
was the offense what was
 
01:57:17.669 --> 01:57:17.679 align:start position:0%
um whether um the
 
01:57:20.350 --> 01:57:20.360 align:start position:0%
forfeiture is uh going to go to federal
 
01:57:24.149 --> 01:57:24.159 align:start position:0%
court or state court things like that so
 
01:57:27.510 --> 01:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
um the the main problem we have had
 
01:57:30.669 --> 01:57:30.679 align:start position:0%
dealing with this kind of um legislation
 
01:57:32.030 --> 01:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
is is
 
01:57:34.470 --> 01:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
information um on exactly what's going
 
01:57:37.149 --> 01:57:37.159 align:start position:0%
on and because we get sort of summary
 
01:57:40.510 --> 01:57:40.520 align:start position:0%
kinds of things but we don't get um this
 
01:57:43.910 --> 01:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
level of detail so um it would be nice I
 
01:57:47.430 --> 01:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
don't think um I mean the bill has a a
 
01:57:51.629 --> 01:57:51.639 align:start position:0%
fiscal note that says um that it's going
 
01:57:52.990 --> 01:57:53.000 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:57:54.270 --> 01:57:54.280 align:start position:0%
I don't know it looks like about a half
 
01:57:57.069 --> 01:57:57.079 align:start position:0%
a person's worth of work but I can't
 
01:58:00.510 --> 01:58:00.520 align:start position:0%
imagine it's it's anything like that um
 
01:58:02.629 --> 01:58:02.639 align:start position:0%
you know if somebody who has access to
 
01:58:06.830 --> 01:58:06.840 align:start position:0%
the court systems um computer system I
 
01:58:09.310 --> 01:58:09.320 align:start position:0%
think could go through this the the
 
01:58:13.350 --> 01:58:13.360 align:start position:0%
number of cases here 100 cases or 200
 
01:58:15.510 --> 01:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
cases or whatever create this sort of
 
01:58:15.520 --> 01:58:17.149 align:start position:0%
cases or whatever create this sort of
summary

01:58:17.149 --> 01:58:17.159 align:start position:0%
summary
 
01:58:20.510 --> 01:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
information relatively quickly not not
 
01:58:22.709 --> 01:58:22.719 align:start position:0%
it's not a halftime job for a for a
 
01:58:25.229 --> 01:58:25.239 align:start position:0%
person in my opinion and I'm happy to
 
01:58:25.239 --> 01:58:26.189 align:start position:0%
person in my opinion and I'm happy to
answer

01:58:26.189 --> 01:58:26.199 align:start position:0%
answer
 
01:58:28.550 --> 01:58:28.560 align:start position:0%
questions representative Alexander thank
 
01:58:31.950 --> 01:58:31.960 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you representative
 
01:58:34.310 --> 01:58:34.320 align:start position:0%
um why is it in the Public's interest to
 
01:58:35.589 --> 01:58:35.599 align:start position:0%
know this
 
01:58:37.629 --> 01:58:37.639 align:start position:0%
information well thank you for the
 
01:58:40.390 --> 01:58:40.400 align:start position:0%
question but when we make
 
01:58:40.400 --> 01:58:41.990 align:start position:0%
question but when we make
legislation

01:58:41.990 --> 01:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:58:47.030 --> 01:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
um we have to know what's going on to to
 
01:58:51.589 --> 01:58:51.599 align:start position:0%
decide um is is the public interest uh
 
01:58:54.990 --> 01:58:55.000 align:start position:0%
being satisfied right I mean if we don't
 
01:58:58.589 --> 01:58:58.599 align:start position:0%
know uh suppose we were to find out for
 
01:59:02.229 --> 01:59:02.239 align:start position:0%
example that that 90% of the cases
 
01:59:06.629 --> 01:59:06.639 align:start position:0%
involve cheap cars and and and $2,000
 
01:59:09.149 --> 01:59:09.159 align:start position:0%
worth of cash
 
01:59:11.790 --> 01:59:11.800 align:start position:0%
um you know we might think we're we're
 
01:59:16.709 --> 01:59:16.719 align:start position:0%
sort of over um over enforcing something
 
01:59:20.030 --> 01:59:20.040 align:start position:0%
or or you know it' be a different
 
01:59:22.629 --> 01:59:22.639 align:start position:0%
character than than if
 
01:59:24.510 --> 01:59:24.520 align:start position:0%
most of the cases are
 
01:59:27.910 --> 01:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
$100,000 and and houses and things like
 
01:59:31.990 --> 01:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
that right so so we just we want to know
 
01:59:35.390 --> 01:59:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:38.950 --> 01:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
on representative uh Mark Farland thank
 
01:59:41.790 --> 01:59:41.800 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman representative Maguire
 
01:59:44.149 --> 01:59:44.159 align:start position:0%
uh I'm looking at the uh the bill I'm
 
01:59:46.589 --> 01:59:46.599 align:start position:0%
looking at rows 24 and
 
01:59:49.750 --> 01:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
25 uh of the
 
01:59:54.229 --> 01:59:54.239 align:start position:0%
Bell if there there is a forfeiture uh
 
01:59:56.229 --> 01:59:56.239 align:start position:0%
that meets that the criteria of that
 
01:59:56.239 --> 01:59:57.310 align:start position:0%
that meets that the criteria of that
Clause

01:59:57.310 --> 01:59:57.320 align:start position:0%
Clause
 
02:00:00.350 --> 02:00:00.360 align:start position:0%
L um you know it talks about made
 
02:00:02.750 --> 02:00:02.760 align:start position:0%
without the federal agency's involvement
 
02:00:05.030 --> 02:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
in the seizure in the seizure and that
 
02:00:07.990 --> 02:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
seems to me to be a clause that is
 
02:00:09.830 --> 02:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
subject to an awful lot of
 
02:00:12.189 --> 02:00:12.199 align:start position:0%
interpretation um could you help me
 
02:00:16.430 --> 02:00:16.440 align:start position:0%
understand for example if uh a stop was
 
02:00:20.350 --> 02:00:20.360 align:start position:0%
made by state or local officials and in
 
02:00:22.990 --> 02:00:23.000 align:start position:0%
the course of the stop they had their
 
02:00:25.270 --> 02:00:25.280 align:start position:0%
dispatcher make reference to certain
 
02:00:25.280 --> 02:00:26.430 align:start position:0%
dispatcher make reference to certain
federal

02:00:26.430 --> 02:00:26.440 align:start position:0%
federal
 
02:00:30.310 --> 02:00:30.320 align:start position:0%
databases um would that then involve
 
02:00:32.790 --> 02:00:32.800 align:start position:0%
Federal agency's involvement and and
 
02:00:35.870 --> 02:00:35.880 align:start position:0%
might there be a need to adjust that
 
02:00:38.109 --> 02:00:38.119 align:start position:0%
language well that's a that thank you
 
02:00:39.790 --> 02:00:39.800 align:start position:0%
for the question I I guess that's an
 
02:00:41.669 --> 02:00:41.679 align:start position:0%
interesting interpretation that I hadn't
 
02:00:44.950 --> 02:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
thought of before but in general I think
 
02:00:48.350 --> 02:00:48.360 align:start position:0%
what we intended here was was there
 
02:00:51.430 --> 02:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
active Personnel involved like the FBI
 
02:00:56.109 --> 02:00:56.119 align:start position:0%
or something like that um rather than uh
 
02:00:58.669 --> 02:00:58.679 align:start position:0%
database kind of things followup yeah
 
02:01:00.510 --> 02:01:00.520 align:start position:0%
know and and I I perceived that intent
 
02:01:02.790 --> 02:01:02.800 align:start position:0%
and I I I am very sympathetic to that
 
02:01:04.870 --> 02:01:04.880 align:start position:0%
intent I just want to make sure we
 
02:01:07.270 --> 02:01:07.280 align:start position:0%
structure the language closely enough
 
02:01:09.270 --> 02:01:09.280 align:start position:0%
that the intent is what is reflected in
 
02:01:12.750 --> 02:01:12.760 align:start position:0%
statute thank you representative
 
02:01:15.109 --> 02:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
Rambo thank you uh thank you for taking
 
02:01:17.270 --> 02:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
my question to the extent this
 
02:01:19.589 --> 02:01:19.599 align:start position:0%
additional information might
 
02:01:21.950 --> 02:01:21.960 align:start position:0%
inform some of the concerns that were
 
02:01:23.430 --> 02:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
treding to be addressed by the prior
 
02:01:27.589 --> 02:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
bill by HB 615 um in your opinion would
 
02:01:29.270 --> 02:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
there be benefit
 
02:01:33.229 --> 02:01:33.239 align:start position:0%
to this sort of reporting Bill uh to try
 
02:01:34.870 --> 02:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
out the sort of reporting bill in
 
02:01:38.950 --> 02:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
advance of implementing the changes
 
02:01:41.790 --> 02:01:41.800 align:start position:0%
contemplated by 615 yes thank you for
 
02:01:44.310 --> 02:01:44.320 align:start position:0%
the question and I I guess because I
 
02:01:47.270 --> 02:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
submitted both I submitted the other
 
02:01:50.069 --> 02:01:50.079 align:start position:0%
vill my my answer is no I I don't want
 
02:01:52.790 --> 02:01:52.800 align:start position:0%
to wait uh for that and and to tell you
 
02:01:54.229 --> 02:01:54.239 align:start position:0%
the truth I mean I've been working on
 
02:01:57.709 --> 02:01:57.719 align:start position:0%
this area and proposing legislation on
 
02:02:00.950 --> 02:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
it for more than a decade so you know
 
02:02:03.550 --> 02:02:03.560 align:start position:0%
it's I think it's time to to make
 
02:02:06.390 --> 02:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
progress we have made some I mean we did
 
02:02:10.750 --> 02:02:10.760 align:start position:0%
get um in law the the fact that that
 
02:02:13.910 --> 02:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
criminal forfeiture criminal conviction
 
02:02:16.669 --> 02:02:16.679 align:start position:0%
is a prerequisite to forfeiture the
 
02:02:19.430 --> 02:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
problem is the way we have gotten it it
 
02:02:22.709 --> 02:02:22.719 align:start position:0%
it it doesn't have teeth it doesn't
 
02:02:25.189 --> 02:02:25.199 align:start position:0%
always happen that way and and so I
 
02:02:28.430 --> 02:02:28.440 align:start position:0%
think that's an important um goal of the
 
02:02:31.910 --> 02:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
first piece of legislation thank you
 
02:02:34.830 --> 02:02:34.840 align:start position:0%
representative Smith thank you um
 
02:02:37.750 --> 02:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
representative I might have misheard you
 
02:02:42.189 --> 02:02:42.199 align:start position:0%
um I I thought I heard you refer to the
 
02:02:43.990 --> 02:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
fact that it would
 
02:02:47.310 --> 02:02:47.320 align:start position:0%
not uh be a particular burden on the
 
02:02:51.669 --> 02:02:51.679 align:start position:0%
court system to get this information but
 
02:02:51.679 --> 02:02:53.030 align:start position:0%
court system to get this information but
uh

02:02:53.030 --> 02:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:02:55.790 --> 02:02:55.800 align:start position:0%
I thought that this was focused on the
 
02:02:57.990 --> 02:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
Attorney General yes thank you for the
 
02:02:59.550 --> 02:02:59.560 align:start position:0%
question it's the Attorney General's
 
02:03:03.629 --> 02:03:03.639 align:start position:0%
office which makes this um this report
 
02:03:06.870 --> 02:03:06.880 align:start position:0%
but I think the data is is contained in
 
02:03:10.830 --> 02:03:10.840 align:start position:0%
the the database that's that's of cases
 
02:03:13.030 --> 02:03:13.040 align:start position:0%
that's maintained by the by the court
 
02:03:15.870 --> 02:03:15.880 align:start position:0%
system but I think in general
 
02:03:18.510 --> 02:03:18.520 align:start position:0%
attorneys um have access to that
 
02:03:20.310 --> 02:03:20.320 align:start position:0%
database I could be wrong about that I
 
02:03:20.320 --> 02:03:22.870 align:start position:0%
database I could be wrong about that I
suppose

02:03:22.870 --> 02:03:22.880 align:start position:0%
suppose
 
02:03:25.510 --> 02:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
representative TR yeah thank you and
 
02:03:28.470 --> 02:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking the question um uh
 
02:03:31.149 --> 02:03:31.159 align:start position:0%
just a maybe a technical clarification
 
02:03:34.669 --> 02:03:34.679 align:start position:0%
online to um where it says 120 days
 
02:03:37.350 --> 02:03:37.360 align:start position:0%
after the close of the fiscal year I'm
 
02:03:39.790 --> 02:03:39.800 align:start position:0%
wondering if it needs to sort of specify
 
02:03:44.109 --> 02:03:44.119 align:start position:0%
what what date or what um uh part of
 
02:03:46.350 --> 02:03:46.360 align:start position:0%
this whole proceeding will trigger it to
 
02:03:48.390 --> 02:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
fall within a given Year's reporting
 
02:03:49.830 --> 02:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
basically you know you've got the date
 
02:03:51.149 --> 02:03:51.159 align:start position:0%
of the crime you've got the date of the
 
02:03:53.109 --> 02:03:53.119 align:start position:0%
arrest you've got the date of the court
 
02:03:55.189 --> 02:03:55.199 align:start position:0%
hearing you have potentially date of a
 
02:03:57.270 --> 02:03:57.280 align:start position:0%
seizure which is at a different time I
 
02:03:58.750 --> 02:03:58.760 align:start position:0%
wasn't sure if you had an opinion
 
02:04:00.870 --> 02:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
whether that should be part of
 
02:04:05.189 --> 02:04:05.199 align:start position:0%
this yes thank you for the question
 
02:04:05.199 --> 02:04:07.030 align:start position:0%
this yes thank you for the question
um

02:04:07.030 --> 02:04:07.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:12.109 --> 02:04:12.119 align:start position:0%
so you're asking about the date of the
 
02:04:14.549 --> 02:04:14.559 align:start position:0%
there is some ambigu ambiguity in the
 
02:04:18.149 --> 02:04:18.159 align:start position:0%
sense that um you know it's an ongoing
 
02:04:20.470 --> 02:04:20.480 align:start position:0%
process as as to what's happening with a
 
02:04:24.470 --> 02:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
given case right so so a case may be
 
02:04:27.109 --> 02:04:27.119 align:start position:0%
through seizure and waiting to go to
 
02:04:29.709 --> 02:04:29.719 align:start position:0%
court at the time you're going to report
 
02:04:32.990 --> 02:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
on it right and and and I think that's
 
02:04:38.390 --> 02:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
a that's part of um current reporting as
 
02:04:40.390 --> 02:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
well I mean it's it's not a new problem
 
02:04:44.470 --> 02:04:44.480 align:start position:0%
I mean this 120 days is existing law and
 
02:04:50.069 --> 02:04:50.079 align:start position:0%
so I think um in general the part of
 
02:04:52.470 --> 02:04:52.480 align:start position:0%
this is you you report on the status of
 
02:04:54.430 --> 02:04:54.440 align:start position:0%
this particular case right that you can
 
02:04:56.669 --> 02:04:56.679 align:start position:0%
again you can think of a table with one
 
02:04:59.669 --> 02:04:59.679 align:start position:0%
line for every case and so the status of
 
02:05:02.549 --> 02:05:02.559 align:start position:0%
that particular case could be you know
 
02:05:05.750 --> 02:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
waiting for court and and not yet you
 
02:05:07.870 --> 02:05:07.880 align:start position:0%
know so so you would fill in on that
 
02:05:09.950 --> 02:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
table the things that are currently
 
02:05:13.030 --> 02:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
known right but not things that are
 
02:05:15.430 --> 02:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
obviously not yet known yeah just one
 
02:05:19.030 --> 02:05:19.040 align:start position:0%
quote follow up on that um so that's
 
02:05:20.510 --> 02:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
actually an interesting answer which I
 
02:05:22.790 --> 02:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
hadn't thought of so this is not
 
02:05:25.830 --> 02:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily a single reporting of a
 
02:05:28.709 --> 02:05:28.719 align:start position:0%
forfeiture a forfeiture could if we
 
02:05:30.549 --> 02:05:30.559 align:start position:0%
don't clarify what triggers the
 
02:05:32.510 --> 02:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
reporting requirement could fall into
 
02:05:34.790 --> 02:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
multiple years of reporting and I worry
 
02:05:36.790 --> 02:05:36.800 align:start position:0%
that that might degrade the quality of
 
02:05:41.750 --> 02:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
what we know if if things are sort
 
02:05:45.870 --> 02:05:45.880 align:start position:0%
of not unique yes thank you for the
 
02:05:48.149 --> 02:05:48.159 align:start position:0%
question but I I don't really think so
 
02:05:51.229 --> 02:05:51.239 align:start position:0%
because you could sort the the table and
 
02:05:54.390 --> 02:05:54.400 align:start position:0%
find the things that are final right and
 
02:05:58.750 --> 02:05:58.760 align:start position:0%
so um you know and go from there right
 
02:06:02.629 --> 02:06:02.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:05.870 --> 02:06:05.880 align:start position:0%
data any other questions representative
 
02:06:08.069 --> 02:06:08.079 align:start position:0%
Manos thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:06:10.470 --> 02:06:10.480 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I'm wondering if
 
02:06:14.310 --> 02:06:14.320 align:start position:0%
this is data that is already tracked but
 
02:06:18.990 --> 02:06:19.000 align:start position:0%
not reported or is this data which is
 
02:06:22.350 --> 02:06:22.360 align:start position:0%
not tracked and if it's not track is it
 
02:06:22.360 --> 02:06:24.030 align:start position:0%
not tracked and if it's not track is it
easily

02:06:24.030 --> 02:06:24.040 align:start position:0%
easily
 
02:06:26.069 --> 02:06:26.079 align:start position:0%
available thank you yes thank you for
 
02:06:29.069 --> 02:06:29.079 align:start position:0%
the question no I believe this is data
 
02:06:33.069 --> 02:06:33.079 align:start position:0%
that exist so so it is tracked um with
 
02:06:33.079 --> 02:06:33.830 align:start position:0%
that exist so so it is tracked um with
the

02:06:33.830 --> 02:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:06:37.870 --> 02:06:37.880 align:start position:0%
cases um and and so therefore it
 
02:06:37.880 --> 02:06:38.709 align:start position:0%
cases um and and so therefore it
shouldn't

02:06:38.709 --> 02:06:38.719 align:start position:0%
shouldn't
 
02:06:41.069 --> 02:06:41.079 align:start position:0%
be I don't think there's anything here
 
02:06:43.709 --> 02:06:43.719 align:start position:0%
that should be very difficult to report
 
02:06:49.310 --> 02:06:49.320 align:start position:0%
on now the the one place where I I might
 
02:06:53.470 --> 02:06:53.480 align:start position:0%
have some uh
 
02:06:55.470 --> 02:06:55.480 align:start position:0%
I would I would sort of temper that that
 
02:07:00.750 --> 02:07:00.760 align:start position:0%
answer is number 20 so I don't know for
 
02:07:04.350 --> 02:07:04.360 align:start position:0%
sure that when a case
 
02:07:07.350 --> 02:07:07.360 align:start position:0%
goes goes Federal right when when it
 
02:07:09.669 --> 02:07:09.679 align:start position:0%
when a law enforcement decides to take a
 
02:07:12.109 --> 02:07:12.119 align:start position:0%
case to the federal prosecutor and the
 
02:07:16.270 --> 02:07:16.280 align:start position:0%
federal prosecutor accepts that case
 
02:07:21.950 --> 02:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
whether our New Hampshire um database
 
02:07:24.990 --> 02:07:25.000 align:start position:0%
has that case in it you see what I mean
 
02:07:27.950 --> 02:07:27.960 align:start position:0%
so that's an area that
 
02:07:32.069 --> 02:07:32.079 align:start position:0%
might uh sort of require extra reporting
 
02:07:36.549 --> 02:07:36.559 align:start position:0%
from the law enforcement to the um
 
02:07:40.109 --> 02:07:40.119 align:start position:0%
attorney general to add to this
 
02:07:43.229 --> 02:07:43.239 align:start position:0%
report follow up I'll set okay any other
 
02:07:45.709 --> 02:07:45.719 align:start position:0%
questions for represent McGuire San
 
02:07:47.950 --> 02:07:47.960 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman uh
 
02:08:02.549 --> 02:08:02.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:05.149 --> 02:08:05.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I was excited to
 
02:08:06.750 --> 02:08:06.760 align:start position:0%
congratulate my old seatmate
 
02:08:08.990 --> 02:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
representative Manion on his temporary
 
02:08:10.270 --> 02:08:10.280 align:start position:0%
appointment as chair I also got
 
02:08:12.189 --> 02:08:12.199 align:start position:0%
temporarily appointed as Vice chair well
 
02:08:13.310 --> 02:08:13.320 align:start position:0%
I'm not congratulating you
 
02:08:16.310 --> 02:08:16.320 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander but uh it's
 
02:08:17.950 --> 02:08:17.960 align:start position:0%
always a pleasure to be here today
 
02:08:19.629 --> 02:08:19.639 align:start position:0%
before house Judiciary ranking member
 
02:08:21.990 --> 02:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you for having me
 
02:08:24.470 --> 02:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
I last year last term served on the
 
02:08:26.510 --> 02:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
house criminal justice and Public Safety
 
02:08:28.950 --> 02:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
Committee and representative Maguire had
 
02:08:31.229 --> 02:08:31.239 align:start position:0%
brought forward legislation around civil
 
02:08:33.310 --> 02:08:33.320 align:start position:0%
forfeiture what we had determined and
 
02:08:35.030 --> 02:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
what we had found in the conversations
 
02:08:36.830 --> 02:08:36.840 align:start position:0%
around that legislation is there is this
 
02:08:38.870 --> 02:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
significant lack of data when it comes
 
02:08:42.069 --> 02:08:42.079 align:start position:0%
to these procedures these whatever you
 
02:08:44.109 --> 02:08:44.119 align:start position:0%
want to call them the civil forfeitures
 
02:08:45.990 --> 02:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
and this legislation I think is an
 
02:08:47.589 --> 02:08:47.599 align:start position:0%
appropriate change to statute which
 
02:08:49.589 --> 02:08:49.599 align:start position:0%
would allow us to report this data in a
 
02:08:51.910 --> 02:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
more comprehensive way uh I think
 
02:08:53.750 --> 02:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire handled it well I
 
02:08:55.390 --> 02:08:55.400 align:start position:0%
think representative papichi Mueller
 
02:08:57.549 --> 02:08:57.559 align:start position:0%
will handle it even better than I could
 
02:08:59.750 --> 02:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
so I'll just leave it there I was a
 
02:09:01.870 --> 02:09:01.880 align:start position:0%
former member of the committee uh that
 
02:09:03.549 --> 02:09:03.559 align:start position:0%
handled legislation that he had proposed
 
02:09:05.750 --> 02:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
last year and as somebody that wants to
 
02:09:08.189 --> 02:09:08.199 align:start position:0%
make informed decisions as a legislator
 
02:09:10.030 --> 02:09:10.040 align:start position:0%
I would think a more comprehensive view
 
02:09:12.549 --> 02:09:12.559 align:start position:0%
of what uh the Civil forfeiture
 
02:09:14.910 --> 02:09:14.920 align:start position:0%
procedures are about is uh appropriate
 
02:09:16.870 --> 02:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
for the legislature to do so thank you
 
02:09:18.950 --> 02:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
Mr chair for the time and be happy to
 
02:09:21.069 --> 02:09:21.079 align:start position:0%
take any questions but others could
 
02:09:23.310 --> 02:09:23.320 align:start position:0%
answer better than I great questions for
 
02:09:23.320 --> 02:09:24.589 align:start position:0%
answer better than I great questions for
representative

02:09:24.589 --> 02:09:24.599 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:09:27.109 --> 02:09:27.119 align:start position:0%
wheeler seeing none thank
 
02:09:30.709 --> 02:09:30.719 align:start position:0%
you um I think I had a pink
 
02:09:30.719 --> 02:09:34.589 align:start position:0%
you um I think I had a pink
card

02:09:34.589 --> 02:09:34.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:44.709 --> 02:09:44.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:47.229 --> 02:09:47.239 align:start position:0%
Whitney it's me again uh Alis Whitney
 
02:09:48.990 --> 02:09:49.000 align:start position:0%
for the record uh legislative council at
 
02:09:50.910 --> 02:09:50.920 align:start position:0%
The Institute for justice um I'll keep
 
02:09:53.030 --> 02:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
it brief we support this bill and we
 
02:09:56.589 --> 02:09:56.599 align:start position:0%
encourage uh this committee to pass it
 
02:10:00.830 --> 02:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
um we have looked at the uh data
 
02:10:02.709 --> 02:10:02.719 align:start position:0%
collected for forfeiture practices in
 
02:10:06.830 --> 02:10:06.840 align:start position:0%
all 50 states um New Hampshire we simply
 
02:10:09.030 --> 02:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
don't have much data at all so we think
 
02:10:11.109 --> 02:10:11.119 align:start position:0%
more transparency is better that would
 
02:10:14.149 --> 02:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
give this this body uh the general court
 
02:10:16.069 --> 02:10:16.079 align:start position:0%
the the information and the tools
 
02:10:19.270 --> 02:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
necessary to make more robust forfeiture
 
02:10:21.069 --> 02:10:21.079 align:start position:0%
process related reforms and we think
 
02:10:23.350 --> 02:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
more transparency more information is
 
02:10:25.830 --> 02:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
always better uh with that I'm happy to
 
02:10:27.270 --> 02:10:27.280 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that you may have
 
02:10:29.990 --> 02:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:34.229 --> 02:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
much any questions representative
 
02:10:36.310 --> 02:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
McFarland my only question is with
 
02:10:39.430 --> 02:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
regard to that Clause L again um if we
 
02:10:41.270 --> 02:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
were to contemplate an amendment to
 
02:10:43.910 --> 02:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
narrow the uh the language to the
 
02:10:46.470 --> 02:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
sponsor's intent uh that we heard from
 
02:10:47.950 --> 02:10:47.960 align:start position:0%
his testimony
 
02:10:51.270 --> 02:10:51.280 align:start position:0%
earlier do you believe there is any cir
 
02:10:54.189 --> 02:10:54.199 align:start position:0%
irance that would exceed uh
 
02:10:56.390 --> 02:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
contemporaneous human involvement by the
 
02:10:58.549 --> 02:10:58.559 align:start position:0%
federal agency that you would want to
 
02:11:01.109 --> 02:11:01.119 align:start position:0%
include in there I'm I'm sorry I don't
 
02:11:03.270 --> 02:11:03.280 align:start position:0%
quite understand the question so so I'm
 
02:11:05.830 --> 02:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
looking at Claus L and as we were
 
02:11:08.069 --> 02:11:08.079 align:start position:0%
discussing with uh the questions to
 
02:11:12.149 --> 02:11:12.159 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire um it seems that
 
02:11:14.069 --> 02:11:14.079 align:start position:0%
that could be interpreted broadly and it
 
02:11:17.390 --> 02:11:17.400 align:start position:0%
seems that his intent is to interpret it
 
02:11:20.390 --> 02:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh more narrowly uh only to apply where
 
02:11:23.270 --> 02:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
the the federal government agency is uh
 
02:11:25.189 --> 02:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
really directly and and
 
02:11:28.629 --> 02:11:28.639 align:start position:0%
contemporaneously involved in the arrest
 
02:11:31.549 --> 02:11:31.559 align:start position:0%
um I I guess I I'll simplify my question
 
02:11:33.430 --> 02:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
uh is there a a different set of
 
02:11:35.830 --> 02:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
language that you might suggest for that
 
02:11:38.310 --> 02:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
that would be better in your
 
02:11:41.990 --> 02:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
mind thank you for the question um I'd
 
02:11:43.510 --> 02:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
be happy to propose that language if
 
02:11:46.390 --> 02:11:46.400 align:start position:0%
that is the intent of uh representative
 
02:11:48.910 --> 02:11:48.920 align:start position:0%
Maguire and the sponsors um I think the
 
02:11:52.030 --> 02:11:52.040 align:start position:0%
way that it is written right now I
 
02:11:53.910 --> 02:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
my interpretation is that it is limited
 
02:11:55.470 --> 02:11:55.480 align:start position:0%
because of it limits it to Federal
 
02:11:57.270 --> 02:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
agency involvement and I think that
 
02:11:59.510 --> 02:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
would because it talks about the seizure
 
02:12:01.830 --> 02:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
and not the forfeiture um that it is
 
02:12:04.589 --> 02:12:04.599 align:start position:0%
limited to instances where state and
 
02:12:06.270 --> 02:12:06.280 align:start position:0%
local authorities might be working with
 
02:12:08.270 --> 02:12:08.280 align:start position:0%
their Federal counterpart Federal
 
02:12:10.830 --> 02:12:10.840 align:start position:0%
counterparts in uh drug interdiction
 
02:12:13.229 --> 02:12:13.239 align:start position:0%
task forces for example thank you
 
02:12:15.589 --> 02:12:15.599 align:start position:0%
so any other
 
02:12:22.629 --> 02:12:22.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:25.589 --> 02:12:25.599 align:start position:0%
and uh is it
 
02:12:27.629 --> 02:12:27.639 align:start position:0%
Daniel oh I didn't even know who it was
 
02:12:29.950 --> 02:12:29.960 align:start position:0%
I couldn't even see that difficult to
 
02:12:33.149 --> 02:12:33.159 align:start position:0%
read apologize representative thank you
 
02:12:34.830 --> 02:12:34.840 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and members of the committee
 
02:12:36.510 --> 02:12:36.520 align:start position:0%
I'm the one who should apologize for my
 
02:12:39.229 --> 02:12:39.239 align:start position:0%
terrible handwriting and it's only my
 
02:12:40.910 --> 02:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
second card field for the day so I
 
02:12:44.149 --> 02:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
cannot exactly plead exhaustion here um
 
02:12:45.990 --> 02:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
I just want to briefly as the prime
 
02:12:48.629 --> 02:12:48.639 align:start position:0%
sponsor on the bill um you know explain
 
02:12:50.629 --> 02:12:50.639 align:start position:0%
why it was brought up right if you
 
02:12:50.639 --> 02:12:52.229 align:start position:0%
why it was brought up right if you
remember

02:12:52.229 --> 02:12:52.239 align:start position:0%
remember
 
02:12:55.910 --> 02:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
we had um discussions in previous years
 
02:12:58.709 --> 02:12:58.719 align:start position:0%
about you know whether changes to the
 
02:13:00.629 --> 02:13:00.639 align:start position:0%
Civil for feature laws need to be made
 
02:13:02.589 --> 02:13:02.599 align:start position:0%
in any way and one of the major concerns
 
02:13:05.189 --> 02:13:05.199 align:start position:0%
again was the lack of data now we do
 
02:13:08.830 --> 02:13:08.840 align:start position:0%
have the existing you know 6 1 colum 12
 
02:13:11.990 --> 02:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral one language so we already
 
02:13:14.510 --> 02:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
have a report but we had a statutory
 
02:13:16.390 --> 02:13:16.400 align:start position:0%
Committee created last fall that looked
 
02:13:19.390 --> 02:13:19.400 align:start position:0%
at the for feature civil for feature and
 
02:13:21.990 --> 02:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
We examined that report in detail and it
 
02:13:24.229 --> 02:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
really wasn't useful at all for policy
 
02:13:27.109 --> 02:13:27.119 align:start position:0%
or for transparency because it has very
 
02:13:28.709 --> 02:13:28.719 align:start position:0%
very limited data that doesn't really
 
02:13:30.870 --> 02:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
tell you what happened so this is just
 
02:13:32.629 --> 02:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
an attempt to make the data available
 
02:13:34.750 --> 02:13:34.760 align:start position:0%
both to the public because you know they
 
02:13:36.669 --> 02:13:36.679 align:start position:0%
should know what we're are doing and
 
02:13:38.549 --> 02:13:38.559 align:start position:0%
also to the you know people who make
 
02:13:41.629 --> 02:13:41.639 align:start position:0%
policy on just more information about
 
02:13:43.470 --> 02:13:43.480 align:start position:0%
exactly what's going on that would help
 
02:13:46.589 --> 02:13:46.599 align:start position:0%
us in drive the right policy the burden
 
02:13:48.990 --> 02:13:49.000 align:start position:0%
is on the Attorney General as it was we
 
02:13:51.069 --> 02:13:51.079 align:start position:0%
do not change the deadlines so any
 
02:13:53.069 --> 02:13:53.079 align:start position:0%
concerns about the incomplete cases
 
02:13:54.549 --> 02:13:54.559 align:start position:0%
really they are already applying to
 
02:13:56.709 --> 02:13:56.719 align:start position:0%
current law the current report has the
 
02:13:58.709 --> 02:13:58.719 align:start position:0%
same exact concerns we are not touching
 
02:14:00.950 --> 02:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
those deadlines in any
 
02:14:05.910 --> 02:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
way we um we feel that all these data
 
02:14:08.229 --> 02:14:08.239 align:start position:0%
that we are asking for is already
 
02:14:09.629 --> 02:14:09.639 align:start position:0%
available I mean if you look at it there
 
02:14:11.149 --> 02:14:11.159 align:start position:0%
is nothing here that wouldn't be in a
 
02:14:13.629 --> 02:14:13.639 align:start position:0%
case File even the concern raised over
 
02:14:15.510 --> 02:14:15.520 align:start position:0%
line 20 on whether the for feure is
 
02:14:17.549 --> 02:14:17.559 align:start position:0%
sought under federal law local
 
02:14:19.549 --> 02:14:19.559 align:start position:0%
prosecutors and federal prosecutors have
 
02:14:22.709 --> 02:14:22.719 align:start position:0%
to be aware of when the case is becoming
 
02:14:23.990 --> 02:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
Federal because they're talking about
 
02:14:25.950 --> 02:14:25.960 align:start position:0%
the same property they got to coordinate
 
02:14:29.270 --> 02:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
so the local prosecutors would know that
 
02:14:30.950 --> 02:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
the federal agency is coming in and
 
02:14:33.069 --> 02:14:33.079 align:start position:0%
saying no no no that's my case now you
 
02:14:35.990 --> 02:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
guys stand down we got it so that data
 
02:14:37.990 --> 02:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
would be available and would be easily
 
02:14:41.390 --> 02:14:41.400 align:start position:0%
reported to the attorney general and we
 
02:14:43.910 --> 02:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
Tred to make this as simple as possible
 
02:14:46.310 --> 02:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
we actually looked at different states
 
02:14:48.589 --> 02:14:48.599 align:start position:0%
and we paired down some of the other
 
02:14:50.229 --> 02:14:50.239 align:start position:0%
requirements that were in other states
 
02:14:51.870 --> 02:14:51.880 align:start position:0%
because they we felt they were too much
 
02:14:53.510 --> 02:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire and for the questions
 
02:14:55.709 --> 02:14:55.719 align:start position:0%
we were trying to ask and the last thing
 
02:14:57.629 --> 02:14:57.639 align:start position:0%
I'll say is that how many bills do you
 
02:14:59.390 --> 02:14:59.400 align:start position:0%
have that really have you know nobody
 
02:15:01.589 --> 02:15:01.599 align:start position:0%
test testifying against them nobody
 
02:15:03.229 --> 02:15:03.239 align:start position:0%
signing up in the blue sheet against
 
02:15:05.149 --> 02:15:05.159 align:start position:0%
them I'm not going to Hazard the guess
 
02:15:07.549 --> 02:15:07.559 align:start position:0%
on any online comments but I think this
 
02:15:10.470 --> 02:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
is a very basic Common Sense minimal
 
02:15:12.350 --> 02:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
expansion of reporting that would bring
 
02:15:14.990 --> 02:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
Great Value to
 
02:15:17.350 --> 02:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
everyone any
 
02:15:20.950 --> 02:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
questions representative tur thanks
 
02:15:22.189 --> 02:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking the
 
02:15:24.229 --> 02:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
question I'm going to circle back to the
 
02:15:26.750 --> 02:15:26.760 align:start position:0%
same question I asked earlier about sort
 
02:15:29.830 --> 02:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
of establishing a trigger date for when
 
02:15:32.390 --> 02:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
something gets reported versus what
 
02:15:34.390 --> 02:15:34.400 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire said which is
 
02:15:36.470 --> 02:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
essentially any case that could
 
02:15:38.870 --> 02:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
potentially be in this process would get
 
02:15:41.149 --> 02:15:41.159 align:start position:0%
reported at any point at which it's in
 
02:15:44.549 --> 02:15:44.559 align:start position:0%
the process I I I guess I'm wondering
 
02:15:46.589 --> 02:15:46.599 align:start position:0%
what would your thoughts be on amending
 
02:15:49.910 --> 02:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
this to to basically trigger this at the
 
02:15:53.510 --> 02:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
final State when we know sort of what
 
02:15:56.310 --> 02:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
the state's actual seizure was and the
 
02:15:58.470 --> 02:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
reason the reason I asked it not to not
 
02:16:00.069 --> 02:16:00.079 align:start position:0%
to run out the question
 
02:16:02.669 --> 02:16:02.679 align:start position:0%
is particularly we we have these Clauses
 
02:16:04.470 --> 02:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
about innocent owners and things like
 
02:16:06.549 --> 02:16:06.559 align:start position:0%
that you know I could see that person
 
02:16:09.189 --> 02:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
being reported as the owner at one point
 
02:16:11.149 --> 02:16:11.159 align:start position:0%
before they've claimed be their
 
02:16:13.430 --> 02:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
innocence and you know it seems like it
 
02:16:15.189 --> 02:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
could get very confusing in terms of
 
02:16:18.549 --> 02:16:18.559 align:start position:0%
what the value of this data would be if
 
02:16:21.669 --> 02:16:21.679 align:start position:0%
you're not looking at a finalized
 
02:16:25.390 --> 02:16:25.400 align:start position:0%
settled process at the end so would you
 
02:16:27.189 --> 02:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
would you be supportive or do you have a
 
02:16:28.870 --> 02:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
reason why that would not be a good
 
02:16:30.910 --> 02:16:30.920 align:start position:0%
change thank you for the question I
 
02:16:32.549 --> 02:16:32.559 align:start position:0%
really appreciate it and I appreciate
 
02:16:35.469 --> 02:16:35.479 align:start position:0%
your concern on this
 
02:16:38.870 --> 02:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
um I would obviously I recognize that if
 
02:16:40.110 --> 02:16:40.120 align:start position:0%
the committee would like to amend the
 
02:16:41.750 --> 02:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
legislation the committee May amend the
 
02:16:44.070 --> 02:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
legislation in any way they see fit and
 
02:16:45.830 --> 02:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
you know that's the perogative of the
 
02:16:49.309 --> 02:16:49.319 align:start position:0%
committee personally I would support the
 
02:16:51.150 --> 02:16:51.160 align:start position:0%
language as written and here are the
 
02:16:55.349 --> 02:16:55.359 align:start position:0%
reasons why first all this data that is
 
02:16:57.549 --> 02:16:57.559 align:start position:0%
reported is already public data from
 
02:16:59.589 --> 02:16:59.599 align:start position:0%
court system so if there is any concern
 
02:17:01.429 --> 02:17:01.439 align:start position:0%
about somebody being you know
 
02:17:04.070 --> 02:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
temporarily you know named as somebody
 
02:17:05.950 --> 02:17:05.960 align:start position:0%
who's being prosecuted again that's
 
02:17:08.750 --> 02:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
public information already also you will
 
02:17:12.230 --> 02:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
notice that we don't really have names
 
02:17:15.070 --> 02:17:15.080 align:start position:0%
here we have a criminal case number so
 
02:17:16.910 --> 02:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
people could go to the courts and find
 
02:17:19.589 --> 02:17:19.599 align:start position:0%
out that information but this doesn't
 
02:17:22.589 --> 02:17:22.599 align:start position:0%
say you know Joe Johnson is being
 
02:17:25.190 --> 02:17:25.200 align:start position:0%
prosecuted he just says case number y y
 
02:17:28.150 --> 02:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
in this court the other concern that I
 
02:17:30.429 --> 02:17:30.439 align:start position:0%
would have over only reporting finalized
 
02:17:32.349 --> 02:17:32.359 align:start position:0%
stuff is that some of these cases can
 
02:17:34.270 --> 02:17:34.280 align:start position:0%
take a long time to run their way
 
02:17:37.309 --> 02:17:37.319 align:start position:0%
through court so it would really prevent
 
02:17:39.389 --> 02:17:39.399 align:start position:0%
us from seeing how much property was
 
02:17:41.429 --> 02:17:41.439 align:start position:0%
seized in the previous year we may see
 
02:17:42.990 --> 02:17:43.000 align:start position:0%
two and three years down the road
 
02:17:45.589 --> 02:17:45.599 align:start position:0%
therefore you know making it harder to
 
02:17:48.629 --> 02:17:48.639 align:start position:0%
judge and the volume of this the
 
02:17:52.070 --> 02:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
previous year report has maybe 20 lines
 
02:17:53.830 --> 02:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
it's not one of those spreadsheet with
 
02:17:56.309 --> 02:17:56.319 align:start position:0%
thousands and thousands of cases it's
 
02:17:59.750 --> 02:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
you know a limited number of them so it
 
02:18:01.950 --> 02:18:01.960 align:start position:0%
should not be difficult at all to again
 
02:18:03.870 --> 02:18:03.880 align:start position:0%
just filter by hey I want just to see
 
02:18:06.309 --> 02:18:06.319 align:start position:0%
the finalized cases or I would like to
 
02:18:07.870 --> 02:18:07.880 align:start position:0%
see everything that was seized
 
02:18:10.270 --> 02:18:10.280 align:start position:0%
regardless of what the current disposal
 
02:18:13.270 --> 02:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
was again if I want to look at say that
 
02:18:15.549 --> 02:18:15.559 align:start position:0%
we are already in May and the 20day has
 
02:18:17.230 --> 02:18:17.240 align:start position:0%
passed it's May
 
02:18:19.830 --> 02:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
2025 if we would change the language
 
02:18:22.230 --> 02:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
then by looking at the May 2025 report I
 
02:18:23.990 --> 02:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
would not be able to see how much stuff
 
02:18:26.830 --> 02:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
was seized in 2024 because a good part
 
02:18:29.750 --> 02:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
of that would still be litigated so
 
02:18:31.190 --> 02:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
that's really the reason why it is
 
02:18:33.629 --> 02:18:33.639 align:start position:0%
written this way in the current law and
 
02:18:37.709 --> 02:18:37.719 align:start position:0%
in our law and you know again up to the
 
02:18:39.469 --> 02:18:39.479 align:start position:0%
committee thank
 
02:18:42.709 --> 02:18:42.719 align:start position:0%
you thank you anyone else have any
 
02:18:44.870 --> 02:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
02:18:46.750 --> 02:18:46.760 align:start position:0%
you so much is there anyone else that
 
02:18:47.980 --> 02:18:47.990 align:start position:0%
wants to speak on House
 
02:18:47.990 --> 02:18:49.429 align:start position:0%
wants to speak on House
[Music]

02:18:49.429 --> 02:18:49.439 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:18:52.309 --> 02:18:52.319 align:start position:0%
Bill the right here
 
02:18:54.669 --> 02:18:54.679 align:start position:0%
509 seeing none I'm going to close the
 
02:19:37.110 --> 02:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:38.589 --> 02:19:38.599 align:start position:0%
I think there's a public interest in
 
02:19:40.990 --> 02:19:41.000 align:start position:0%
knowing he won the lottery and um first
 
02:19:45.309 --> 02:19:45.319 align:start position:0%
of all playing the lottery is uh is
 
02:19:47.190 --> 02:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
voluntary so if you don't want to run
 
02:19:48.830 --> 02:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
the risk of winning and having your name
 
02:19:51.150 --> 02:19:51.160 align:start position:0%
exposed you you can all you're free to
 
02:19:54.790 --> 02:19:54.800 align:start position:0%
not play but also you can turn a winning
 
02:19:56.950 --> 02:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
ticket over to a trust or other way or
 
02:19:59.270 --> 02:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
you know to um you know conceal your
 
02:20:19.630 --> 02:20:19.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:58.469 --> 02:20:58.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:59.550 --> 02:20:59.560 align:start position:0%
all right we have a few minutes so we're
 
02:21:01.590 --> 02:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
GNA open up an executive session on
 
02:21:04.070 --> 02:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
house bow 485 that we heard last week
 
02:21:06.670 --> 02:21:06.680 align:start position:0%
and I recognize representative Alexander
 
02:21:07.870 --> 02:21:07.880 align:start position:0%
for a
 
02:21:10.270 --> 02:21:10.280 align:start position:0%
motion um thank you Mr chair I move on
 
02:21:10.280 --> 02:21:11.550 align:start position:0%
motion um thank you Mr chair I move on
to

02:21:11.550 --> 02:21:11.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:21:15.710 --> 02:21:15.720 align:start position:0%
pass second seconded by representative
 
02:21:18.750 --> 02:21:18.760 align:start position:0%
Smith any discussion on the bill at all
 
02:21:22.590 --> 02:21:22.600 align:start position:0%
um I just briefly think it's okay to
 
02:21:24.670 --> 02:21:24.680 align:start position:0%
remain an anonymous if you win the
 
02:21:27.309 --> 02:21:27.319 align:start position:0%
lottery I actually think that there's
 
02:21:28.790 --> 02:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
really no public interest in figuring
 
02:21:30.630 --> 02:21:30.640 align:start position:0%
out who won the lottery and I actually
 
02:21:31.790 --> 02:21:31.800 align:start position:0%
think there's a lot of drama involved
 
02:21:34.830 --> 02:21:34.840 align:start position:0%
when you win the lottery so um if I ever
 
02:21:37.590 --> 02:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
happen to win you won't see me ever
 
02:21:39.190 --> 02:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
again and I will be off on an island
 
02:21:41.150 --> 02:21:41.160 align:start position:0%
somewhere else and nobody will know
 
02:21:42.830 --> 02:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
because I will be anonymous hopefully
 
02:21:45.110 --> 02:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
thank you but there will be signs
 
02:21:46.190 --> 02:21:46.200 align:start position:0%
representative Smith you want to speak
 
02:21:48.830 --> 02:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
on your second thank you aside from my
 
02:21:52.670 --> 02:21:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:55.150 --> 02:21:55.160 align:start position:0%
my strong belief in personal privacy if
 
02:21:59.389 --> 02:21:59.399 align:start position:0%
you look at the language in this um uh
 
02:22:01.950 --> 02:22:01.960 align:start position:0%
in this particular bill it is very
 
02:22:04.870 --> 02:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
specific and there're very clear reasons
 
02:22:08.790 --> 02:22:08.800 align:start position:0%
why uh privacy might be essential to
 
02:22:12.110 --> 02:22:12.120 align:start position:0%
protect the well-being of the potential
 
02:22:14.670 --> 02:22:14.680 align:start position:0%
winner you any other discussion on this
 
02:22:16.670 --> 02:22:16.680 align:start position:0%
bill representative Oregan well just to
 
02:22:18.830 --> 02:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
say repeat what I well reiterate what I
 
02:22:20.550 --> 02:22:20.560 align:start position:0%
said before in the context of the ACT
 
02:22:24.150 --> 02:22:24.160 align:start position:0%
executive session um if you don't if you
 
02:22:26.270 --> 02:22:26.280 align:start position:0%
don't want to run the RIS of of winning
 
02:22:27.590 --> 02:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
and having your name published you're
 
02:22:29.630 --> 02:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
free not to buy a ticket in the first
 
02:22:33.590 --> 02:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
place um and which is actually except
 
02:22:35.070 --> 02:22:35.080 align:start position:0%
occasionally when the power ball gets
 
02:22:37.270 --> 02:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
very high is actually the economically
 
02:22:41.469 --> 02:22:41.479 align:start position:0%
optimal strategy and also you can you
 
02:22:41.479 --> 02:22:42.790 align:start position:0%
optimal strategy and also you can you
can

02:22:42.790 --> 02:22:42.800 align:start position:0%
can
 
02:22:45.590 --> 02:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
um you you you can turn the ticket over
 
02:22:48.790 --> 02:22:48.800 align:start position:0%
to a trust before you uh before you
 
02:22:50.630 --> 02:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
before you accept the ticket too which
 
02:22:52.150 --> 02:22:52.160 align:start position:0%
is uh you
 
02:22:55.110 --> 02:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
know which which if it's a large large
 
02:22:57.429 --> 02:22:57.439 align:start position:0%
prize is probably not a bad idea anyway
 
02:23:00.270 --> 02:23:00.280 align:start position:0%
so I think the existing law is uh is
 
02:23:02.230 --> 02:23:02.240 align:start position:0%
sufficient so um
 
02:23:04.830 --> 02:23:04.840 align:start position:0%
and I will admit I didn't actually
 
02:23:06.389 --> 02:23:06.399 align:start position:0%
didn't attend the hearing on this bill
 
02:23:08.110 --> 02:23:08.120 align:start position:0%
but it's a perennial Bill I've seen many
 
02:23:10.030 --> 02:23:10.040 align:start position:0%
many bills in the P this this is a bill
 
02:23:11.830 --> 02:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
that comes up almost every session so
 
02:23:13.830 --> 02:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
I've always been opposed to it so I'm
 
02:23:15.830 --> 02:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
I'm going to continue being opposed to
 
02:23:19.590 --> 02:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
it so okay very very briefly the the
 
02:23:22.590 --> 02:23:22.600 align:start position:0%
most com compelling reason that I heard
 
02:23:24.349 --> 02:23:24.359 align:start position:0%
articulated in the hearing on the bill
 
02:23:26.750 --> 02:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
for disclosing this is to be used as
 
02:23:29.110 --> 02:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
marketing material for the lottery
 
02:23:32.469 --> 02:23:32.479 align:start position:0%
itself which I think is uh an easy you
 
02:23:34.469 --> 02:23:34.479 align:start position:0%
know interest to overcome in the names
 
02:23:38.070 --> 02:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
of the the anonymity that this bill is
 
02:23:40.349 --> 02:23:40.359 align:start position:0%
providing thank you any more discussion
 
02:23:43.230 --> 02:23:43.240 align:start position:0%
on it seeing none I'll ask the clerk to
 
02:23:47.309 --> 02:23:47.319 align:start position:0%

02:24:47.190 --> 02:24:47.200 align:start position:0%
n no you got Tom any objections going on
 
02:24:50.110 --> 02:24:50.120 align:start position:0%
the consent calendar I guess um no I
 
02:24:51.309 --> 02:24:51.319 align:start position:0%
guess may as well let it go on the
 
02:24:52.990 --> 02:24:53.000 align:start position:0%
consent calendar but okay and do you
 
02:24:55.349 --> 02:24:55.359 align:start position:0%
want to write a Minority Report on it oh
 
02:24:56.630 --> 02:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
actually guess I would like to write one
 
02:24:57.750 --> 02:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
in which case it has to go on the
 
02:25:00.630 --> 02:25:00.640 align:start position:0%
regular calendar so yes so just a very
 
02:25:06.790 --> 02:25:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:10.190 --> 02:25:10.200 align:start position:0%
yeah uh uh Mr chair I just want to make
 
02:25:13.950 --> 02:25:13.960 align:start position:0%
sure that representative haran has in
 
02:25:17.429 --> 02:25:17.439 align:start position:0%
fact um I know he was not able to be
 
02:25:18.910 --> 02:25:18.920 align:start position:0%
here for the hearing but to make sure
 
02:25:20.790 --> 02:25:20.800 align:start position:0%
that he has in fact read read the
 
02:25:25.190 --> 02:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
details of this particular bill um as
 
02:25:27.990 --> 02:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
compared with the many previous bills
 
02:25:31.349 --> 02:25:31.359 align:start position:0%
that he has seen in earlier years before
 
02:25:32.950 --> 02:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
he commits
 
02:25:36.750 --> 02:25:36.760 align:start position:0%
to H H have you looked at the bill yes I
 
02:25:38.950 --> 02:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
have but I guess I I will withdraw my
 
02:25:40.469 --> 02:25:40.479 align:start position:0%
objection to putting on the consent
 
02:25:42.510 --> 02:25:42.520 align:start position:0%
calendar so we'll see how we'll see what
 
02:25:46.389 --> 02:25:46.399 align:start position:0%
happens when it um goes through the
 
02:25:49.150 --> 02:25:49.160 align:start position:0%
legislative process to see yes so I mean
 
02:25:51.990 --> 02:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
I I I I I have read the so no objection
 
02:25:53.670 --> 02:25:53.680 align:start position:0%
to it going on consent no you can put it
 
02:26:12.710 --> 02:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:14.590 --> 02:26:14.600 align:start position:0%
you right I'm going to close the
 
02:26:19.230 --> 02:26:19.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:19.240 --> 02:26:49.230 align:start position:0%
 
485

02:26:49.230 --> 02:26:49.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:49.240 --> 02:27:19.150 align:start position:0%
 
e

02:27:19.150 --> 02:27:19.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:19.160 --> 02:27:49.110 align:start position:0%
 
e

02:27:49.110 --> 02:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:43.389 --> 02:28:43.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:46.309 --> 02:28:46.319 align:start position:0%
Bill 601 if we just want to take a straw
 
02:28:51.230 --> 02:28:51.240 align:start position:0%
vote um to see who is interested in
 
02:28:55.309 --> 02:28:55.319 align:start position:0%
yeah oh yeah itl for that if anyone's in
 
02:29:02.910 --> 02:29:02.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:06.870 --> 02:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
601 that's relative to causes of action
 
02:29:09.630 --> 02:29:09.640 align:start position:0%
against companies that misstate the
 
02:29:11.070 --> 02:29:11.080 align:start position:0%
impacts of their business on the
 
02:29:11.080 --> 02:29:39.070 align:start position:0%
impacts of their business on the
environment

02:29:39.070 --> 02:29:39.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:41.910 --> 02:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
or or make a suggestion um and I don't
 
02:29:43.110 --> 02:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
know what everybody's lunch plans are
 
02:29:45.469 --> 02:29:45.479 align:start position:0%
would it be possible for us to come back
 
02:29:46.510 --> 02:29:46.520 align:start position:0%
from lunch a little earlier if we're

3:00 deadline so obviously the chair
 
02:30:08.110 --> 02:30:08.120 align:start position:0%
appropriately wants at least have some
 
02:30:10.510 --> 02:30:10.520 align:start position:0%

Matt if you could help me out therey
 
03:34:53.110 --> 03:34:53.120 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chairman Manion and
 
03:34:54.189 --> 03:34:54.199 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I'm
 
03:34:56.550 --> 03:34:56.560 align:start position:0%
representative Matt saborn D Schwaner
 
03:34:58.830 --> 03:34:58.840 align:start position:0%
from rocket m30 sebr I knew it
 
03:35:02.309 --> 03:35:02.319 align:start position:0%
introducing HB 587 today allowing
 
03:35:05.590 --> 03:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
admission of one audio and one party
 
03:35:08.269 --> 03:35:08.279 align:start position:0%
audio and video recordings and circum
 
03:35:10.510 --> 03:35:10.520 align:start position:0%
certain circumstances those
 
03:35:14.349 --> 03:35:14.359 align:start position:0%
circumstances being domestic violence So
 
03:35:16.229 --> 03:35:16.239 align:start position:0%
currently as the law stands if someone's
 
03:35:18.110 --> 03:35:18.120 align:start position:0%
in a domestic violence situation if they
 
03:35:20.229 --> 03:35:20.239 align:start position:0%
were to record their abuser is actually
 
03:35:22.750 --> 03:35:22.760 align:start position:0%
classified as a felony under the law uh
 
03:35:24.070 --> 03:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
this would create an exception for that
 
03:35:26.590 --> 03:35:26.600 align:start position:0%
to allow if someone is recording or is
 
03:35:28.389 --> 03:35:28.399 align:start position:0%
experiencing the domestic abuse that
 
03:35:30.110 --> 03:35:30.120 align:start position:0%
they can
 
03:35:33.150 --> 03:35:33.160 align:start position:0%
um um basically submit that recording as
 
03:35:35.510 --> 03:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
part of evidence collection to a court
 
03:35:37.030 --> 03:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
or a police
 
03:35:40.110 --> 03:35:40.120 align:start position:0%
report and that's actually the I think
 
03:35:42.630 --> 03:35:42.640 align:start position:0%
the language is pretty simple I didn't
 
03:35:44.389 --> 03:35:44.399 align:start position:0%
have too too I didn't have too much
 
03:35:46.750 --> 03:35:46.760 align:start position:0%
testimony today have questions that's it
 
03:35:47.910 --> 03:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
any questions I know there's a lot of
 
03:35:50.030 --> 03:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
folks here that also here to testify and
 
03:35:52.790 --> 03:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
support yep representative McFarland
 
03:35:54.830 --> 03:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh representative
 
03:35:59.389 --> 03:35:59.399 align:start position:0%
Sab um you you indicate the intent is to
 
03:36:01.469 --> 03:36:01.479 align:start position:0%
be limited to crimes of domestic
 
03:36:03.870 --> 03:36:03.880 align:start position:0%
violence yes I don't see that reflected
 
03:36:09.510 --> 03:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:11.630 --> 03:36:11.640 align:start position:0%
seven okay thank you for pointing that
 
03:36:13.750 --> 03:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
out well I guess let me phas it as a
 
03:36:14.950 --> 03:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
question because I was intending it as a
 
03:36:17.349 --> 03:36:17.359 align:start position:0%
question do you agree with my my
 
03:36:18.750 --> 03:36:18.760 align:start position:0%
assertion and do you think that the
 
03:36:21.389 --> 03:36:21.399 align:start position:0%
language needs to be modified
 
03:36:23.990 --> 03:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
um if if it's the committee's bill now
 
03:36:25.229 --> 03:36:25.239 align:start position:0%
and if if the committee believes that
 
03:36:26.429 --> 03:36:26.439 align:start position:0%
that's the best way to carry out that
 
03:36:28.469 --> 03:36:28.479 align:start position:0%
intent it could also be used I mean what
 
03:36:29.670 --> 03:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
what if there's like child abuse
 
03:36:33.429 --> 03:36:33.439 align:start position:0%
happening too so I mean so
 
03:36:39.670 --> 03:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
I follow up yeah follow up so I I I
 
03:36:41.990 --> 03:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
mean without regard to whether it's
 
03:36:43.630 --> 03:36:43.640 align:start position:0%
domestic violence or not if we just read
 
03:36:46.269 --> 03:36:46.279 align:start position:0%
the language as as written MH is or
 
03:36:47.870 --> 03:36:47.880 align:start position:0%
contains evidence of what the person
 
03:36:50.950 --> 03:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
reasonably believes to be a crime MH
 
03:36:53.030 --> 03:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
could you explain to us in this
 
03:36:55.550 --> 03:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
hypothetical where somebody has taken
 
03:36:57.150 --> 03:36:57.160 align:start position:0%
one of these recordings and is is going
 
03:36:59.590 --> 03:36:59.600 align:start position:0%
to be submitting it how are they
 
03:37:02.870 --> 03:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
supposed to have known our priori that
 
03:37:05.870 --> 03:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
the the recording that they are taking
 
03:37:08.830 --> 03:37:08.840 align:start position:0%
against the current law uh is in fact
 
03:37:10.630 --> 03:37:10.640 align:start position:0%
subject to this exemption because how
 
03:37:12.590 --> 03:37:12.600 align:start position:0%
would they have known prior to the start
 
03:37:13.910 --> 03:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
of the recording that something would
 
03:37:15.030 --> 03:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
happen during the course of the
 
03:37:15.040 --> 03:37:16.030 align:start position:0%
happen during the course of the
recording

03:37:16.030 --> 03:37:16.040 align:start position:0%
recording
 
03:37:18.469 --> 03:37:18.479 align:start position:0%
that would be in their estimation of
 
03:37:23.510 --> 03:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
crime uh it's more emergency situations
 
03:37:27.150 --> 03:37:27.160 align:start position:0%
no it it says reason reasonably believes
 
03:37:29.710 --> 03:37:29.720 align:start position:0%
okay so so your your expectation here is
 
03:37:30.710 --> 03:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
that this is the sort of thing that
 
03:37:32.590 --> 03:37:32.600 align:start position:0%
would happen once they believe a crime
 
03:37:33.910 --> 03:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
is already being committed and then they
 
03:37:36.349 --> 03:37:36.359 align:start position:0%
can start recording yes thank
 
03:37:39.469 --> 03:37:39.479 align:start position:0%
you thank you for your question any
 
03:37:41.389 --> 03:37:41.399 align:start position:0%
other questions representative
 
03:37:43.550 --> 03:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
ter yeah thanks and thanks for the
 
03:37:46.030 --> 03:37:46.040 align:start position:0%
question um you know the to the bill
 
03:37:48.189 --> 03:37:48.199 align:start position:0%
seems pretty clear I think it's also on
 
03:37:51.349 --> 03:37:51.359 align:start position:0%
on the question of the way it's word um
 
03:37:54.510 --> 03:37:54.520 align:start position:0%
the way I read this it sounds like you
 
03:37:57.150 --> 03:37:57.160 align:start position:0%
have to provide your recording to law
 
03:37:59.389 --> 03:37:59.399 align:start position:0%
enforcement um and utilize for the
 
03:38:01.710 --> 03:38:01.720 align:start position:0%
purpose of Court proceedings I'm feeling
 
03:38:03.630 --> 03:38:03.640 align:start position:0%
like maybe it should also state that you
 
03:38:06.189 --> 03:38:06.199 align:start position:0%
can't you utilize that recording for any
 
03:38:08.389 --> 03:38:08.399 align:start position:0%
other purpose because I could see people
 
03:38:10.429 --> 03:38:10.439 align:start position:0%
potentially posting that to social media
 
03:38:12.710 --> 03:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
as well at the same time and that
 
03:38:15.830 --> 03:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
changes the dynamic pretty cor correct
 
03:38:18.469 --> 03:38:18.479 align:start position:0%
that thank you thank you for your
 
03:38:18.479 --> 03:38:20.550 align:start position:0%
that thank you thank you for your
contribution

03:38:20.550 --> 03:38:20.560 align:start position:0%
contribution
 
03:38:22.710 --> 03:38:22.720 align:start position:0%
that's any other
 
03:38:25.030 --> 03:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
03:38:25.040 --> 03:38:27.229 align:start position:0%

03:39:18.070 --> 03:39:18.080 align:start position:0%
the record my name is jod n and I
 
03:39:19.670 --> 03:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
represent the good folks of chesher 4
 
03:39:21.469 --> 03:39:21.479 align:start position:0%
and Keen I'd like to express my
 
03:39:22.950 --> 03:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
gratitude to the committee members for
 
03:39:25.550 --> 03:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
giving me your time and attention today
 
03:39:27.189 --> 03:39:27.199 align:start position:0%
I wanted to share a little bit about why
 
03:39:28.830 --> 03:39:28.840 align:start position:0%
I'm enthusiastically supporting this
 
03:39:32.070 --> 03:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
change to our wiretapping statute um
 
03:39:34.550 --> 03:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
last year as The Honorable uh chairman
 
03:39:36.750 --> 03:39:36.760 align:start position:0%
Manion will likely remember from
 
03:39:38.429 --> 03:39:38.439 align:start position:0%
Criminal the criminal justice committee
 
03:39:41.630 --> 03:39:41.640 align:start position:0%
days his criminal justice days um we
 
03:39:44.070 --> 03:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
heard a similar bill or uh I'll be at
 
03:39:46.269 --> 03:39:46.279 align:start position:0%
one that was too broad in scope um and
 
03:39:49.189 --> 03:39:49.199 align:start position:0%
ultimately just unpassable at that time
 
03:39:50.710 --> 03:39:50.720 align:start position:0%
the importance of working on and
 
03:39:52.030 --> 03:39:52.040 align:start position:0%
crafting bill that would address the
 
03:39:54.070 --> 03:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
needs of folks experiencing domestic
 
03:39:56.189 --> 03:39:56.199 align:start position:0%
violence uh was brought up in that
 
03:39:58.830 --> 03:39:58.840 align:start position:0%
hearing fortunately uh the governor's
 
03:40:00.229 --> 03:40:00.239 align:start position:0%
Commission on Domestic and Sexual
 
03:40:02.309 --> 03:40:02.319 align:start position:0%
Violence had been working on appropriate
 
03:40:04.910 --> 03:40:04.920 align:start position:0%
language uh to accomplish this goal and
 
03:40:06.950 --> 03:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
this language here is the result of
 
03:40:09.469 --> 03:40:09.479 align:start position:0%
their hard work in
 
03:40:11.790 --> 03:40:11.800 align:start position:0%
diligence um since then I've heard from
 
03:40:13.269 --> 03:40:13.279 align:start position:0%
many Advocates domestic violence
 
03:40:15.389 --> 03:40:15.399 align:start position:0%
counselors and survivors about how
 
03:40:17.349 --> 03:40:17.359 align:start position:0%
having this kind of opportunity to
 
03:40:19.670 --> 03:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
obtain credible evidence of the abuse
 
03:40:21.550 --> 03:40:21.560 align:start position:0%
against them is crucial to holding
 
03:40:23.950 --> 03:40:23.960 align:start position:0%
abusers accountable the bottom line as
 
03:40:26.070 --> 03:40:26.080 align:start position:0%
far as I can see it is that domestic
 
03:40:27.910 --> 03:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
violence is a crime that the vast
 
03:40:29.790 --> 03:40:29.800 align:start position:0%
majority of time happens behind closed
 
03:40:31.870 --> 03:40:31.880 align:start position:0%
doors it is often well hidden and
 
03:40:33.670 --> 03:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
victims are kept silent in large part
 
03:40:34.990 --> 03:40:35.000 align:start position:0%
because they fear they will not be
 
03:40:37.309 --> 03:40:37.319 align:start position:0%
believed no abuser is going to give
 
03:40:39.710 --> 03:40:39.720 align:start position:0%
permission to be recorded in the act of
 
03:40:42.189 --> 03:40:42.199 align:start position:0%
their crime and this law as it currently
 
03:40:43.990 --> 03:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
exists creates one more weapon in their
 
03:40:46.110 --> 03:40:46.120 align:start position:0%
Arsenal effectively shielding them from
 
03:40:48.030 --> 03:40:48.040 align:start position:0%
being held accountable for their crimes
 
03:40:50.189 --> 03:40:50.199 align:start position:0%
or the victim from escaping these
 
03:40:52.630 --> 03:40:52.640 align:start position:0%
circumstances for these reasons I ask
 
03:40:55.229 --> 03:40:55.239 align:start position:0%
that you vote OTP on this important well
 
03:40:57.030 --> 03:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
thought out and desperately needed
 
03:40:59.830 --> 03:40:59.840 align:start position:0%
exemption to our wir tapping statute
 
03:41:01.950 --> 03:41:01.960 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions for this
 
03:41:07.349 --> 03:41:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:25.110 --> 03:41:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:26.990 --> 03:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chair members of the
 
03:41:29.030 --> 03:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Pamela kyg and I'm
 
03:41:30.790 --> 03:41:30.800 align:start position:0%
the public policy specialist at the New
 
03:41:32.429 --> 03:41:32.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Coalition against Domestic and
 
03:41:34.910 --> 03:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
Sexual Violence um as you might know the
 
03:41:36.750 --> 03:41:36.760 align:start position:0%
Coalition is the umbrella Organization
 
03:41:38.670 --> 03:41:38.680 align:start position:0%
for our 12 community- based crisis
 
03:41:40.429 --> 03:41:40.439 align:start position:0%
centers which provide free and
 
03:41:42.750 --> 03:41:42.760 align:start position:0%
confidential services to nearly 15,000
 
03:41:44.309 --> 03:41:44.319 align:start position:0%
survivors of sexual and domestic
 
03:41:45.950 --> 03:41:45.960 align:start position:0%
violence annually
 
03:41:48.110 --> 03:41:48.120 align:start position:0%
um I'm here to speak in support of HB
 
03:41:51.070 --> 03:41:51.080 align:start position:0%
587 which would create an exemption um
 
03:41:53.670 --> 03:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire's wire topping statute
 
03:41:55.910 --> 03:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
um in New Hampshire it is unlawful to
 
03:41:58.030 --> 03:41:58.040 align:start position:0%
record or disclose the contents of any
 
03:42:00.389 --> 03:42:00.399 align:start position:0%
electronic or in-person communication
 
03:42:02.750 --> 03:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
without the consent of all parties as a
 
03:42:04.790 --> 03:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
state we highly value an individual's
 
03:42:07.309 --> 03:42:07.319 align:start position:0%
right to privacy however we have heard
 
03:42:09.389 --> 03:42:09.399 align:start position:0%
countless examples where domestic
 
03:42:11.149 --> 03:42:11.159 align:start position:0%
violence victims and victims of other
 
03:42:13.950 --> 03:42:13.960 align:start position:0%
crimes have filmed their abusers or
 
03:42:16.990 --> 03:42:17.000 align:start position:0%
other folks who are um causing them harm
 
03:42:18.870 --> 03:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
um committing these egregious acts of
 
03:42:21.469 --> 03:42:21.479 align:start position:0%
violence against them and they have had
 
03:42:25.110 --> 03:42:25.120 align:start position:0%
no evidence of abuse um or they do film
 
03:42:26.790 --> 03:42:26.800 align:start position:0%
them and then they learn that the
 
03:42:29.830 --> 03:42:29.840 align:start position:0%
recording uh violated the law so
 
03:42:31.630 --> 03:42:31.640 align:start position:0%
consequently victims end up facing
 
03:42:33.590 --> 03:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
penalties in the process of seeking
 
03:42:35.870 --> 03:42:35.880 align:start position:0%
relief New Hampshire is one of only a
 
03:42:38.070 --> 03:42:38.080 align:start position:0%
few states that require our all parties
 
03:42:39.630 --> 03:42:39.640 align:start position:0%
to consent to the recording of a
 
03:42:42.070 --> 03:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
conversation most all party states have
 
03:42:43.910 --> 03:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
at least some exemptions for when
 
03:42:46.309 --> 03:42:46.319 align:start position:0%
someone can legally make a recording uh
 
03:42:48.030 --> 03:42:48.040 align:start position:0%
for example in instances of domestic
 
03:42:49.950 --> 03:42:49.960 align:start position:0%
violence and crimes involving sexual
 
03:42:52.429 --> 03:42:52.439 align:start position:0%
assault or abuse of minors um in the
 
03:42:55.429 --> 03:42:55.439 align:start position:0%
case of emergencies um or other crimes
 
03:42:57.710 --> 03:42:57.720 align:start position:0%
if someone is being kidnapped abused or
 
03:42:59.590 --> 03:42:59.600 align:start position:0%
assaulted they should not have to worry
 
03:43:01.229 --> 03:43:01.239 align:start position:0%
about whether the recording they are
 
03:43:03.870 --> 03:43:03.880 align:start position:0%
making in a split second decision is
 
03:43:06.070 --> 03:43:06.080 align:start position:0%
breaking the law as part of the
 
03:43:07.510 --> 03:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
governor's Commission on domestic
 
03:43:09.269 --> 03:43:09.279 align:start position:0%
violence sexual assault and stalking the
 
03:43:11.309 --> 03:43:11.319 align:start position:0%
Coalition has worked alongside experts
 
03:43:12.790 --> 03:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
across the state to improve our
 
03:43:14.790 --> 03:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
community's ability to respond to
 
03:43:16.670 --> 03:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
domestic domc and sexual violence and
 
03:43:18.189 --> 03:43:18.199 align:start position:0%
strengthen support for victims in the
 
03:43:21.030 --> 03:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
granite state when Governor sonunu
 
03:43:23.950 --> 03:43:23.960 align:start position:0%
reestablished the Commission in uh 20122
 
03:43:25.710 --> 03:43:25.720 align:start position:0%
he directed its members to Monitor and
 
03:43:27.950 --> 03:43:27.960 align:start position:0%
review proposed legislation one of the
 
03:43:29.750 --> 03:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
legislative topics that was first
 
03:43:31.910 --> 03:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
brought to our um attention was our
 
03:43:34.070 --> 03:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
state's wiretapping law in the impact
 
03:43:35.870 --> 03:43:35.880 align:start position:0%
that the current statute has in domestic
 
03:43:39.510 --> 03:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
violence cases um as a small group of us
 
03:43:41.469 --> 03:43:41.479 align:start position:0%
worked um over the course of several
 
03:43:43.630 --> 03:43:43.640 align:start position:0%
months um reaching out to different
 
03:43:45.110 --> 03:43:45.120 align:start position:0%
stakeholders across the state and
 
03:43:47.469 --> 03:43:47.479 align:start position:0%
vetting possible legislative proposals
 
03:43:50.469 --> 03:43:50.479 align:start position:0%
the language before you today is um what
 
03:43:53.349 --> 03:43:53.359 align:start position:0%
we ended up landing on as a group um and
 
03:43:56.149 --> 03:43:56.159 align:start position:0%
that includes um victim Advocates civil
 
03:43:58.189 --> 03:43:58.199 align:start position:0%
legal Representatives defense attorneys
 
03:43:59.950 --> 03:43:59.960 align:start position:0%
members of law enforcement and
 
03:44:02.870 --> 03:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
prosecutors um and so I think the
 
03:44:05.309 --> 03:44:05.319 align:start position:0%
biggest thing here is that um Crime
 
03:44:07.070 --> 03:44:07.080 align:start position:0%
Victims can bring forward evidence of
 
03:44:10.070 --> 03:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
the abuse and not be penalized for it um
 
03:44:11.510 --> 03:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
there are a few other folks here that
 
03:44:13.950 --> 03:44:13.960 align:start position:0%
can speak um to the statutory framework
 
03:44:16.670 --> 03:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
of our state's wire in law um but I
 
03:44:19.149 --> 03:44:19.159 align:start position:0%
think what we really want to see is that
 
03:44:20.710 --> 03:44:20.720 align:start position:0%
it's especially important in cases
 
03:44:22.790 --> 03:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
involving crimes like domestic violence
 
03:44:24.030 --> 03:44:24.040 align:start position:0%
where it can be difficult to
 
03:44:25.910 --> 03:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
sufficiently demonstrate the extent of
 
03:44:27.870 --> 03:44:27.880 align:start position:0%
abuse and legal proceedings that they
 
03:44:30.469 --> 03:44:30.479 align:start position:0%
now have this exemption in law um and
 
03:44:32.910 --> 03:44:32.920 align:start position:0%
then aren't penalized uh for making a
 
03:44:35.309 --> 03:44:35.319 align:start position:0%
recording um while they were
 
03:44:37.750 --> 03:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
experiencing abuse um thank you so much
 
03:44:39.590 --> 03:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
and I hope the committee considers um
 
03:44:42.030 --> 03:44:42.040 align:start position:0%
voting OTP on this bill and I'm happy to
 
03:44:45.030 --> 03:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
answer any questions so we had a bill on
 
03:44:46.990 --> 03:44:47.000 align:start position:0%
criminal justice last year did your
 
03:44:49.910 --> 03:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
group oppos that we didn't weigh in on
 
03:44:51.389 --> 03:44:51.399 align:start position:0%
the content of that bill because it was
 
03:44:54.269 --> 03:44:54.279 align:start position:0%
a different scope um we had explored
 
03:44:55.750 --> 03:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
whether that could have been an
 
03:44:58.630 --> 03:44:58.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity to look at this issue um but
 
03:45:01.149 --> 03:45:01.159 align:start position:0%
I think the committee had uh determine
 
03:45:02.630 --> 03:45:02.640 align:start position:0%
that it wasn't germine enough to the
 
03:45:04.870 --> 03:45:04.880 align:start position:0%
underlying intent of the bill um and
 
03:45:06.670 --> 03:45:06.680 align:start position:0%
that we could maybe bring It Forward in
 
03:45:09.110 --> 03:45:09.120 align:start position:0%
another legislative term that's my what
 
03:45:11.110 --> 03:45:11.120 align:start position:0%
I recall yes thank you yeah
 
03:45:13.309 --> 03:45:13.319 align:start position:0%
representative McFarland thank you Mr
 
03:45:15.349 --> 03:45:15.359 align:start position:0%
chairman to the extent that the
 
03:45:17.910 --> 03:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
committee is contemplating amending this
 
03:45:20.750 --> 03:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
bill as written could you give us some
 
03:45:23.990 --> 03:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
indications as to uh what your thoughts
 
03:45:27.630 --> 03:45:27.640 align:start position:0%
are on why it might be uh either a good
 
03:45:30.030 --> 03:45:30.040 align:start position:0%
or a bad thing to move towards being a
 
03:45:33.910 --> 03:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
for one party consent State um I yeah I
 
03:45:37.269 --> 03:45:37.279 align:start position:0%
think uh given uh New Hampshire's strong
 
03:45:39.630 --> 03:45:39.640 align:start position:0%
support for individual privacy and
 
03:45:43.349 --> 03:45:43.359 align:start position:0%
personal privacy we um didn't explore a
 
03:45:47.030 --> 03:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
broadening the statute um that far um so
 
03:45:49.510 --> 03:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to connect um with my
 
03:45:51.950 --> 03:45:51.960 align:start position:0%
colleagues and uh Circle back with you
 
03:45:54.469 --> 03:45:54.479 align:start position:0%
on that but we specifically recognize
 
03:45:56.750 --> 03:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
that without an exemption in our current
 
03:45:59.389 --> 03:45:59.399 align:start position:0%
statute it's um been really challenging
 
03:46:01.710 --> 03:46:01.720 align:start position:0%
for victims in the state who are
 
03:46:05.030 --> 03:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
currently facing um prosecution for
 
03:46:08.590 --> 03:46:08.600 align:start position:0%
trying to present evidence um of abuse
 
03:46:10.590 --> 03:46:10.600 align:start position:0%
um so we just really wanted to have that
 
03:46:13.670 --> 03:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
very narrow Focus to start if that helps
 
03:46:16.429 --> 03:46:16.439 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks any other
 
03:46:21.229 --> 03:46:21.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:24.189 --> 03:46:24.199 align:start position:0%
you okay all
 
03:46:28.950 --> 03:46:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:31.590 --> 03:46:31.600 align:start position:0%
Reed thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:46:35.469 --> 03:46:35.479 align:start position:0%
honorable members um I was of two minds
 
03:46:38.469 --> 03:46:38.479 align:start position:0%
on whether or not to uh
 
03:46:40.910 --> 03:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
testify uh but I heard a couple of
 
03:46:42.550 --> 03:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
things that I wanted to make sure to
 
03:46:45.030 --> 03:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
clarify so I decided to testify but
 
03:46:46.830 --> 03:46:46.840 align:start position:0%
since I'm up here to clarify those
 
03:46:50.750 --> 03:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
points um I thought it um prudent to
 
03:46:53.590 --> 03:46:53.600 align:start position:0%
share my experience and why this would
 
03:46:56.030 --> 03:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
um be something I'm personally
 
03:46:57.710 --> 03:46:57.720 align:start position:0%
interested in and might have been
 
03:47:00.110 --> 03:47:00.120 align:start position:0%
impacted in a in an earlier life when I
 
03:47:04.670 --> 03:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
was uh 18 in Tennessee I uh got involved
 
03:47:06.389 --> 03:47:06.399 align:start position:0%
my first major relationship got involved
 
03:47:08.189 --> 03:47:08.199 align:start position:0%
with a who turned out to be a very very
 
03:47:11.070 --> 03:47:11.080 align:start position:0%
violent man um I can't I've lost count
 
03:47:12.750 --> 03:47:12.760 align:start position:0%
of the number of times he was arrested
 
03:47:15.950 --> 03:47:15.960 align:start position:0%
for uh beating me he hit me with a car
 
03:47:19.750 --> 03:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
on one occasion he held me captive in um
 
03:47:21.510 --> 03:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
his apartment for 3 Days on another
 
03:47:23.550 --> 03:47:23.560 align:start position:0%
occasion when the police finally found
 
03:47:25.830 --> 03:47:25.840 align:start position:0%
me they found me naked with my half of
 
03:47:27.710 --> 03:47:27.720 align:start position:0%
my face completely black and they told
 
03:47:29.910 --> 03:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
me that if I stay that this was the
 
03:47:32.030 --> 03:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
worst case of domestic violence that
 
03:47:33.429 --> 03:47:33.439 align:start position:0%
they had ever seen where someone was
 
03:47:36.030 --> 03:47:36.040 align:start position:0%
still alive and if I stayed the next
 
03:47:38.349 --> 03:47:38.359 align:start position:0%
time they saw me it would be a
 
03:47:41.510 --> 03:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
corpse when I went to one of these court
 
03:47:44.429 --> 03:47:44.439 align:start position:0%
cases um I got I got pulled in because I
 
03:47:45.910 --> 03:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
defended myself it was the time he hit
 
03:47:48.510 --> 03:47:48.520 align:start position:0%
me with the car um and he had some
 
03:47:50.389 --> 03:47:50.399 align:start position:0%
scratch marks on his neck and so I got
 
03:47:52.550 --> 03:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
arrested and he got arrested and it
 
03:47:54.910 --> 03:47:54.920 align:start position:0%
became very much a he said she said
 
03:47:57.950 --> 03:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
situation now Tennessee is a one-party
 
03:48:01.229 --> 03:48:01.239 align:start position:0%
consent state so if this had happened
 
03:48:03.309 --> 03:48:03.319 align:start position:0%
back in the days where everybody had a
 
03:48:05.389 --> 03:48:05.399 align:start position:0%
handy dandy recording device I could
 
03:48:08.790 --> 03:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
have armed myself with video recording
 
03:48:11.070 --> 03:48:11.080 align:start position:0%
or audio recording of those three days
 
03:48:13.030 --> 03:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
or him hitting me with the car or all
 
03:48:15.110 --> 03:48:15.120 align:start position:0%
you know multitude of things that had
 
03:48:17.269 --> 03:48:17.279 align:start position:0%
happened those weren't the days that I
 
03:48:19.550 --> 03:48:19.560 align:start position:0%
that I was existing in at the time but
 
03:48:21.750 --> 03:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
that is why Tennessee is a One recording
 
03:48:23.309 --> 03:48:23.319 align:start position:0%
state I'm fortunate that the judge
 
03:48:26.269 --> 03:48:26.279 align:start position:0%
believed me because she saw the long
 
03:48:29.990 --> 03:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
history of arrests that he had for this
 
03:48:31.429 --> 03:48:31.439 align:start position:0%
case it turns out that he had multiple
 
03:48:33.990 --> 03:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
warrants in other states and um he he
 
03:48:36.149 --> 03:48:36.159 align:start position:0%
ended up actually killing himself after
 
03:48:38.990 --> 03:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
salking me for 16 years killing himself
 
03:48:41.429 --> 03:48:41.439 align:start position:0%
uh the year I got elected to office the
 
03:48:42.990 --> 03:48:43.000 align:start position:0%
first time so that's the end of that
 
03:48:46.149 --> 03:48:46.159 align:start position:0%
story but um the judge believed me but I
 
03:48:48.510 --> 03:48:48.520 align:start position:0%
can only imagine victims because I've
 
03:48:50.030 --> 03:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
also been in situations where victims
 
03:48:52.149 --> 03:48:52.159 align:start position:0%
were not believed I can only imagine
 
03:48:54.309 --> 03:48:54.319 align:start position:0%
victims not being believed and having
 
03:48:56.630 --> 03:48:56.640 align:start position:0%
their hands tied now the the questions I
 
03:48:59.510 --> 03:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to directly address that came up
 
03:49:01.870 --> 03:49:01.880 align:start position:0%
um the idea is how would a person know
 
03:49:03.830 --> 03:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
and I think this was basically partially
 
03:49:06.590 --> 03:49:06.600 align:start position:0%
addressed how would a person know that a
 
03:49:08.870 --> 03:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
priority whether or not um it would be
 
03:49:11.910 --> 03:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
legal for them to recording so the the
 
03:49:13.670 --> 03:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
point is is that they reasonably
 
03:49:15.229 --> 03:49:15.239 align:start position:0%
believed so even if they didn't catch
 
03:49:17.910 --> 03:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
the crime it's not illegal as long as
 
03:49:19.830 --> 03:49:19.840 align:start position:0%
they reasonably believed that it was
 
03:49:23.950 --> 03:49:23.960 align:start position:0%
going to be a crime um the other piece
 
03:49:26.910 --> 03:49:26.920 align:start position:0%
of this is that uh make sure to say that
 
03:49:28.149 --> 03:49:28.159 align:start position:0%
it isn't going to be used for any other
 
03:49:29.750 --> 03:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
purposes I think that can be clearer but
 
03:49:32.030 --> 03:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
it is already in the bill which is that
 
03:49:33.990 --> 03:49:34.000 align:start position:0%
it's has to it's legal so long as it's
 
03:49:35.269 --> 03:49:35.279 align:start position:0%
provided to law
 
03:49:37.550 --> 03:49:37.560 align:start position:0%
enforcement so it's not legal in any
 
03:49:39.830 --> 03:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
other context or for the purposes of a
 
03:49:42.790 --> 03:49:42.800 align:start position:0%
court proceeding um the only thing I
 
03:49:46.990 --> 03:49:47.000 align:start position:0%
would clarify I think is what crimes
 
03:49:49.189 --> 03:49:49.199 align:start position:0%
exactly do you want to capture in this
 
03:49:50.469 --> 03:49:50.479 align:start position:0%
because I don't necessarily know that
 
03:49:52.110 --> 03:49:52.120 align:start position:0%
you want to capture every single crime
 
03:49:54.189 --> 03:49:54.199 align:start position:0%
in this if the argument is this is an
 
03:49:56.590 --> 03:49:56.600 align:start position:0%
urgent situation where a victim doesn't
 
03:49:58.990 --> 03:49:59.000 align:start position:0%
have a chance to question whether or not
 
03:50:01.870 --> 03:50:01.880 align:start position:0%
it's going to be legal and has to whip
 
03:50:03.149 --> 03:50:03.159 align:start position:0%
out their phone and oh my God this
 
03:50:04.510 --> 03:50:04.520 align:start position:0%
person is being violent maybe you just
 
03:50:06.149 --> 03:50:06.159 align:start position:0%
want to capture violent crimes maybe you
 
03:50:07.830 --> 03:50:07.840 align:start position:0%
just want to do Domestic and Sexual
 
03:50:10.870 --> 03:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
Violence maybe um it it's really up to
 
03:50:13.030 --> 03:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
the committee but I would just ask that
 
03:50:15.070 --> 03:50:15.080 align:start position:0%
you question is it every single crime
 
03:50:16.750 --> 03:50:16.760 align:start position:0%
that you want to capture in this because
 
03:50:18.910 --> 03:50:18.920 align:start position:0%
I could foresee people doing kind of an
 
03:50:21.630 --> 03:50:21.640 align:start position:0%
entrapment type scenario and haha I got
 
03:50:24.710 --> 03:50:24.720 align:start position:0%
them saying or doing something um it's
 
03:50:26.790 --> 03:50:26.800 align:start position:0%
just a consideration I'm not saying I'm
 
03:50:28.630 --> 03:50:28.640 align:start position:0%
opposed necessarily to this language I
 
03:50:30.349 --> 03:50:30.359 align:start position:0%
just think it's worth it's probably
 
03:50:33.110 --> 03:50:33.120 align:start position:0%
consideration that needs to be discussed
 
03:50:35.710 --> 03:50:35.720 align:start position:0%
and that's that's my
 
03:50:37.590 --> 03:50:37.600 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you anyone have any
 
03:50:40.670 --> 03:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
questions representative T yeah thanks
 
03:50:43.149 --> 03:50:43.159 align:start position:0%
and and by the way thanks for sharing
 
03:50:45.990 --> 03:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
this in this setting um um I just wanted
 
03:50:47.630 --> 03:50:47.640 align:start position:0%
to follow up on that one point that I
 
03:50:50.229 --> 03:50:50.239 align:start position:0%
raised earlier which is um I I see what
 
03:50:52.630 --> 03:50:52.640 align:start position:0%
you're saying I feel like if in the way
 
03:50:55.429 --> 03:50:55.439 align:start position:0%
it's worded it sort of sounds like if if
 
03:50:57.630 --> 03:50:57.640 align:start position:0%
you turn it over to law enforcement then
 
03:50:59.670 --> 03:50:59.680 align:start position:0%
the the recording itself was legal and
 
03:51:01.710 --> 03:51:01.720 align:start position:0%
that's I guess my concern is that you
 
03:51:03.670 --> 03:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
know it doesn't say that there's any
 
03:51:05.469 --> 03:51:05.479 align:start position:0%
other prohibition on what you use it's
 
03:51:07.189 --> 03:51:07.199 align:start position:0%
just the you were able to record it
 
03:51:09.110 --> 03:51:09.120 align:start position:0%
because it was turned over to law
 
03:51:10.670 --> 03:51:10.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement and that was why I was
 
03:51:12.070 --> 03:51:12.080 align:start position:0%
thinking a
 
03:51:15.309 --> 03:51:15.319 align:start position:0%
modification might be needed and I I am
 
03:51:17.349 --> 03:51:17.359 align:start position:0%
open to hearing I I don't want to
 
03:51:20.389 --> 03:51:20.399 align:start position:0%
restrict someone's ability to share that
 
03:51:23.229 --> 03:51:23.239 align:start position:0%
with their legal counsel share that with
 
03:51:26.110 --> 03:51:26.120 align:start position:0%
their family so I'm not sure how to draw
 
03:51:28.429 --> 03:51:28.439 align:start position:0%
if if we were to modify this how to draw
 
03:51:31.550 --> 03:51:31.560 align:start position:0%
that line exactly um but I guess my
 
03:51:34.110 --> 03:51:34.120 align:start position:0%
concern would be not to allow it to be
 
03:51:35.870 --> 03:51:35.880 align:start position:0%
used in sort of any public setting I
 
03:51:38.349 --> 03:51:38.359 align:start position:0%
don't know what your thoughts are um I I
 
03:51:41.710 --> 03:51:41.720 align:start position:0%
agree I I think that if it passed as is
 
03:51:43.630 --> 03:51:43.640 align:start position:0%
which you have plenty of opportunity to
 
03:51:47.790 --> 03:51:47.800 align:start position:0%
amend here on the floor in the Senate um
 
03:51:47.800 --> 03:51:49.070 align:start position:0%
amend here on the floor in the Senate um
that

03:51:49.070 --> 03:51:49.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:51:51.790 --> 03:51:51.800 align:start position:0%
the I think most judges would read it as
 
03:51:53.309 --> 03:51:53.319 align:start position:0%
it's intended as we all know it's
 
03:51:55.189 --> 03:51:55.199 align:start position:0%
intended to be that that use that
 
03:51:58.550 --> 03:51:58.560 align:start position:0%
specific use is the only legal use um it
 
03:52:00.590 --> 03:52:00.600 align:start position:0%
says utilized later in the sentence but
 
03:52:02.630 --> 03:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
that's specifically to court proceedings
 
03:52:05.830 --> 03:52:05.840 align:start position:0%
so uh which presumptively that's what
 
03:52:07.309 --> 03:52:07.319 align:start position:0%
law enforcement would be doing with it
 
03:52:09.590 --> 03:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
as well however if we're going to amend
 
03:52:11.030 --> 03:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
it I think it's definitely worth making
 
03:52:12.550 --> 03:52:12.560 align:start position:0%
sure that that language is as tight and
 
03:52:14.830 --> 03:52:14.840 align:start position:0%
clean as possible um so so if you're
 
03:52:16.950 --> 03:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
going to for example talk about well do
 
03:52:18.630 --> 03:52:18.640 align:start position:0%
we want to capture every single crime in
 
03:52:21.630 --> 03:52:21.640 align:start position:0%
this then definitely go ahead and fix
 
03:52:23.269 --> 03:52:23.279 align:start position:0%
that language but I do agree with the
 
03:52:26.830 --> 03:52:26.840 align:start position:0%
intent that no other use other than used
 
03:52:29.229 --> 03:52:29.239 align:start position:0%
to prosecute someone who's committed a
 
03:52:32.309 --> 03:52:32.319 align:start position:0%
violent crime should be um kind of
 
03:52:33.550 --> 03:52:33.560 align:start position:0%
blessed in
 
03:52:37.030 --> 03:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
this yeah I'm thinking if we just put
 
03:52:39.149 --> 03:52:39.159 align:start position:0%
solely for the purpose of Court
 
03:52:40.950 --> 03:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
proceedings that some might be simple
 
03:52:42.750 --> 03:52:42.760 align:start position:0%
enough to clean it up but we can we can
 
03:52:44.750 --> 03:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
uh entertain that any other question for
 
03:52:47.189 --> 03:52:47.199 align:start position:0%
this witness representative menos thank
 
03:52:49.910 --> 03:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you um representative
 
03:52:51.830 --> 03:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
Reed and thank you for sharing your
 
03:52:57.070 --> 03:52:57.080 align:start position:0%
story um I wanted to ask you about
 
03:52:59.030 --> 03:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
domestic violence that doesn't rise to
 
03:53:01.630 --> 03:53:01.640 align:start position:0%
the level of a crime I mean there are
 
03:53:04.110 --> 03:53:04.120 align:start position:0%
certainly many many instances of
 
03:53:08.229 --> 03:53:08.239 align:start position:0%
domestic violence that do not are not
 
03:53:11.070 --> 03:53:11.080 align:start position:0%
actually crimes and so I wanted to ask
 
03:53:11.080 --> 03:53:11.990 align:start position:0%
actually crimes and so I wanted to ask
you

03:53:11.990 --> 03:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:53:15.429 --> 03:53:15.439 align:start position:0%
about um whether this should be broader
 
03:53:18.269 --> 03:53:18.279 align:start position:0%
than just in the situation of a a
 
03:53:20.510 --> 03:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
reasonable belief of a
 
03:53:22.710 --> 03:53:22.720 align:start position:0%
crime thank you thank you for the
 
03:53:25.870 --> 03:53:25.880 align:start position:0%
question I um while I can generate
 
03:53:27.830 --> 03:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
examples of things that I would consider
 
03:53:30.950 --> 03:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
to be domestic abuse though not
 
03:53:33.389 --> 03:53:33.399 align:start position:0%
necessarily I guess violence things like
 
03:53:35.670 --> 03:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
I for example and this is I'm very
 
03:53:38.030 --> 03:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
anecdotally I had a neighbor her name
 
03:53:41.349 --> 03:53:41.359 align:start position:0%
was Rose um I would walk my dog I could
 
03:53:42.710 --> 03:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
only talk to Rose through her bedroom
 
03:53:44.630 --> 03:53:44.640 align:start position:0%
window because her husband kept her
 
03:53:47.070 --> 03:53:47.080 align:start position:0%
trapped in her bedroom and basically
 
03:53:48.870 --> 03:53:48.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't let her leave took away her car
 
03:53:50.750 --> 03:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
could she couldn't leave the house and
 
03:53:52.070 --> 03:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
she could only speak to me through her
 
03:53:54.070 --> 03:53:54.080 align:start position:0%
bedroom window he would not take her to
 
03:53:56.269 --> 03:53:56.279 align:start position:0%
the doctor because the co-pay $35 was
 
03:53:59.510 --> 03:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
too expensive um I tried for many many
 
03:54:02.070 --> 03:54:02.080 align:start position:0%
months to get to convince Rose to leave
 
03:54:04.830 --> 03:54:04.840 align:start position:0%
she had tried to go to a a shelter and
 
03:54:06.870 --> 03:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
the women's shelter was full so they
 
03:54:08.590 --> 03:54:08.600 align:start position:0%
sent her to Salvation Army which was
 
03:54:10.710 --> 03:54:10.720 align:start position:0%
filled with people that she felt were
 
03:54:12.349 --> 03:54:12.359 align:start position:0%
scary and she went end up going back to
 
03:54:15.030 --> 03:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
her husband um
 
03:54:17.110 --> 03:54:17.120 align:start position:0%
at the end of that she ended up dying
 
03:54:18.670 --> 03:54:18.680 align:start position:0%
because she didn't get medical care that
 
03:54:20.710 --> 03:54:20.720 align:start position:0%
she needed because her husband wouldn't
 
03:54:23.269 --> 03:54:23.279 align:start position:0%
take her so that would be an example of
 
03:54:27.389 --> 03:54:27.399 align:start position:0%
abuse or potentially violence right um I
 
03:54:28.870 --> 03:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
can generate those examples if you have
 
03:54:31.229 --> 03:54:31.239 align:start position:0%
other examples I'm welcome to hear that
 
03:54:34.670 --> 03:54:34.680 align:start position:0%
that it gets it gets hard to Define some
 
03:54:37.630 --> 03:54:37.640 align:start position:0%
of that for sure and saying violent
 
03:54:39.670 --> 03:54:39.680 align:start position:0%
crime makes it easy and it's better than
 
03:54:41.229 --> 03:54:41.239 align:start position:0%
nothing right it's better than nothing
 
03:54:44.030 --> 03:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
at all but I would definitely support as
 
03:54:46.990 --> 03:54:47.000 align:start position:0%
long we could find that language support
 
03:54:50.229 --> 03:54:50.239 align:start position:0%
good language to that describes domestic
 
03:54:55.309 --> 03:54:55.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:58.389 --> 03:54:58.399 align:start position:0%
absolutely any other questions seeing
 
03:55:00.229 --> 03:55:00.239 align:start position:0%
none thank you thank
 
03:55:14.550 --> 03:55:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:16.389 --> 03:55:16.399 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chairman members of the
 
03:55:18.030 --> 03:55:18.040 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Stephen ERS I'm an
 
03:55:20.990 --> 03:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
assistant County attorney in Marat
 
03:55:23.670 --> 03:55:23.680 align:start position:0%
County I've been a prosecutor for over
 
03:55:26.229 --> 03:55:26.239 align:start position:0%
20 years I was also on the the
 
03:55:28.269 --> 03:55:28.279 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that that wrote this
 
03:55:28.279 --> 03:55:29.830 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that that wrote this
language

03:55:29.830 --> 03:55:29.840 align:start position:0%
language
 
03:55:32.269 --> 03:55:32.279 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that almost all
 
03:55:34.590 --> 03:55:34.600 align:start position:0%
attorneys will universally tell you if
 
03:55:36.950 --> 03:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
you say I feel like I might be getting
 
03:55:39.349 --> 03:55:39.359 align:start position:0%
involved in some type of court case is
 
03:55:41.910 --> 03:55:41.920 align:start position:0%
they're going to tell you document
 
03:55:44.469 --> 03:55:44.479 align:start position:0%
everything write down what's going on
 
03:55:46.349 --> 03:55:46.359 align:start position:0%
write down when you say when you have
 
03:55:48.429 --> 03:55:48.439 align:start position:0%
phone calls write down the contents of
 
03:55:51.189 --> 03:55:51.199 align:start position:0%
those phone calls because really when it
 
03:55:53.149 --> 03:55:53.159 align:start position:0%
comes to court you're going to want to
 
03:55:55.510 --> 03:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
be able to recall exactly what happened
 
03:55:57.870 --> 03:55:57.880 align:start position:0%
explain exactly what happened and
 
03:55:59.229 --> 03:55:59.239 align:start position:0%
demonstrate to the court that you know
 
03:56:00.710 --> 03:56:00.720 align:start position:0%
exactly what
 
03:56:05.070 --> 03:56:05.080 align:start position:0%
happened so now in
 
03:56:07.670 --> 03:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
2025 pretty much all of us are carrying
 
03:56:11.149 --> 03:56:11.159 align:start position:0%
a high quality um video camera around
 
03:56:13.830 --> 03:56:13.840 align:start position:0%
with us at all times or if we don't have
 
03:56:15.510 --> 03:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
it with us it's generally within like
 
03:56:17.070 --> 03:56:17.080 align:start position:0%
three or four feet of where we are at
 
03:56:20.349 --> 03:56:20.359 align:start position:0%
all times so it certainly makes sense
 
03:56:22.429 --> 03:56:22.439 align:start position:0%
that if you're trying to document what's
 
03:56:24.349 --> 03:56:24.359 align:start position:0%
going on and you've got this high
 
03:56:26.149 --> 03:56:26.159 align:start position:0%
quality video camera with you you're
 
03:56:28.429 --> 03:56:28.439 align:start position:0%
going to use it to document what's going
 
03:56:30.990 --> 03:56:31.000 align:start position:0%
on so that you can show your attorney
 
03:56:32.830 --> 03:56:32.840 align:start position:0%
you can show the judge you can show
 
03:56:35.110 --> 03:56:35.120 align:start position:0%
everybody exactly what
 
03:56:39.510 --> 03:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
happened the difficulty comes in that
 
03:56:41.510 --> 03:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
there's a wiretap statute in New
 
03:56:43.630 --> 03:56:43.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and unfortunately the wiretap
 
03:56:45.630 --> 03:56:45.640 align:start position:0%
statute was written in
 
03:56:49.590 --> 03:56:49.600 align:start position:0%
1969 and as you can imagine technology
 
03:56:55.910 --> 03:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
between 1969 and now has changed
 
03:56:58.189 --> 03:56:58.199 align:start position:0%
dramatically when you look at the wir
 
03:57:01.710 --> 03:57:01.720 align:start position:0%
statute they they talk about things that
 
03:57:03.269 --> 03:57:03.279 align:start position:0%
a lot of people now don't even
 
03:57:05.189 --> 03:57:05.199 align:start position:0%
understand what they mean like when you
 
03:57:07.750 --> 03:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
talk about the operator of a switchboard
 
03:57:10.630 --> 03:57:10.640 align:start position:0%
being exempt from the wiretap statute I
 
03:57:14.309 --> 03:57:14.319 align:start position:0%
mean I'm I'm old enough to remember some
 
03:57:15.870 --> 03:57:15.880 align:start position:0%
the television shows where you know
 
03:57:17.950 --> 03:57:17.960 align:start position:0%
there's the operator on the switchboard
 
03:57:20.269 --> 03:57:20.279 align:start position:0%
plugging in the phone lines and
 
03:57:22.429 --> 03:57:22.439 align:start position:0%
listening in on telephone calls that's
 
03:57:24.630 --> 03:57:24.640 align:start position:0%
not illegal under the WAP
 
03:57:28.830 --> 03:57:28.840 align:start position:0%
statute the difficulty though is that
 
03:57:31.110 --> 03:57:31.120 align:start position:0%
recording oral
 
03:57:33.070 --> 03:57:33.080 align:start position:0%
Communications is illegal under the
 
03:57:36.189 --> 03:57:36.199 align:start position:0%
wiretap statute so it's it's not the
 
03:57:38.790 --> 03:57:38.800 align:start position:0%
video portion that's the problem it's
 
03:57:41.670 --> 03:57:41.680 align:start position:0%
the audio associated with the video
 
03:57:44.830 --> 03:57:44.840 align:start position:0%
recording that's the problem
 
03:57:47.429 --> 03:57:47.439 align:start position:0%
so the difficulty is that in a lot of
 
03:57:50.110 --> 03:57:50.120 align:start position:0%
cases um we tell people document
 
03:57:51.550 --> 03:57:51.560 align:start position:0%
everything that's going on the police
 
03:57:53.269 --> 03:57:53.279 align:start position:0%
tell people document everything that's
 
03:57:56.429 --> 03:57:56.439 align:start position:0%
going on and people do that they make
 
03:57:57.830 --> 03:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
recordings they bring the recordings
 
03:58:00.149 --> 03:58:00.159 align:start position:0%
into court and the difficulty is that
 
03:58:01.870 --> 03:58:01.880 align:start position:0%
under the current wiretap statute
 
03:58:04.910 --> 03:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
there's a question of whether or not um
 
03:58:06.790 --> 03:58:06.800 align:start position:0%
making those recordings is
 
03:58:10.469 --> 03:58:10.479 align:start position:0%
legal so we came up with with this
 
03:58:12.710 --> 03:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
language which would be an exemption to
 
03:58:15.229 --> 03:58:15.239 align:start position:0%
the wiretap statute
 
03:58:17.750 --> 03:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
and starting from line three where it
 
03:58:19.469 --> 03:58:19.479 align:start position:0%
talks about any person except a law
 
03:58:20.910 --> 03:58:20.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer acting in their
 
03:58:24.389 --> 03:58:24.399 align:start position:0%
official capacity the reason that we we
 
03:58:26.590 --> 03:58:26.600 align:start position:0%
wrote that language is we started out
 
03:58:29.030 --> 03:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
with any person could do this and then
 
03:58:30.750 --> 03:58:30.760 align:start position:0%
we thought well the problem is that's an
 
03:58:33.110 --> 03:58:33.120 align:start position:0%
exemption that that swallows everything
 
03:58:35.149 --> 03:58:35.159 align:start position:0%
because we don't want law enforcement to
 
03:58:36.750 --> 03:58:36.760 align:start position:0%
be able to go out and surreptitiously
 
03:58:38.590 --> 03:58:38.600 align:start position:0%
record people without warrants you know
 
03:58:41.349 --> 03:58:41.359 align:start position:0%
like we don't want that so we we put in
 
03:58:44.070 --> 03:58:44.080 align:start position:0%
any person except law enforcement but
 
03:58:45.910 --> 03:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
but then we we realize that you know a
 
03:58:47.510 --> 03:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officer when they're off
 
03:58:49.630 --> 03:58:49.640 align:start position:0%
duty may be the victim of domestic
 
03:58:52.189 --> 03:58:52.199 align:start position:0%
violence so that's why we added in that
 
03:58:54.189 --> 03:58:54.199 align:start position:0%
language any person except a law
 
03:58:55.510 --> 03:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer acting in their
 
03:58:57.990 --> 03:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
official capacity can make or possess a
 
03:58:59.510 --> 03:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
recording when that
 
03:59:01.510 --> 03:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
recording is provided to a law
 
03:59:03.710 --> 03:59:03.720 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency and we thought well
 
03:59:05.149 --> 03:59:05.159 align:start position:0%
if you're making it with the intent to
 
03:59:07.269 --> 03:59:07.279 align:start position:0%
provide it to law enforcement that's
 
03:59:09.149 --> 03:59:09.159 align:start position:0%
great and that's why we added that
 
03:59:11.229 --> 03:59:11.239 align:start position:0%
language well then we heard from a lot
 
03:59:12.990 --> 03:59:13.000 align:start position:0%
of the the civil attorneys on the
 
03:59:14.309 --> 03:59:14.319 align:start position:0%
committee and they were saying well what
 
03:59:16.950 --> 03:59:16.960 align:start position:0%
if we have a victim who is involved in a
 
03:59:18.750 --> 03:59:18.760 align:start position:0%
civil case but doesn't want to go
 
03:59:20.630 --> 03:59:20.640 align:start position:0%
forward criminally or is involved in a
 
03:59:22.550 --> 03:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
divorce case but doesn't want to go
 
03:59:25.030 --> 03:59:25.040 align:start position:0%
forward criminally which is why we added
 
03:59:26.990 --> 03:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
in that language or utilized for the
 
03:59:29.590 --> 03:59:29.600 align:start position:0%
purposes of Court proceedings I can tell
 
03:59:32.309 --> 03:59:32.319 align:start position:0%
you that we didn't have the discussion
 
03:59:35.269 --> 03:59:35.279 align:start position:0%
about um if it's exempt under this can
 
03:59:37.910 --> 03:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
you put it on social media that wasn't a
 
03:59:40.469 --> 03:59:40.479 align:start position:0%
discussion that the committee had but
 
03:59:42.710 --> 03:59:42.720 align:start position:0%
certainly I think if you you did write
 
03:59:45.149 --> 03:59:45.159 align:start position:0%
is exclusively Prov provided to law
 
03:59:47.630 --> 03:59:47.640 align:start position:0%
enforcement um or utilized for the
 
03:59:50.990 --> 03:59:51.000 align:start position:0%
purpose of Court proceedings that that
 
03:59:53.590 --> 03:59:53.600 align:start position:0%
that solves that fear or that
 
03:59:57.429 --> 03:59:57.439 align:start position:0%
concern the next language line seven
 
03:59:59.189 --> 03:59:59.199 align:start position:0%
iser contains evidence of what the
 
04:00:03.149 --> 04:00:03.159 align:start position:0%
person reasonably believes to be a
 
04:00:06.389 --> 04:00:06.399 align:start position:0%
crime we came out with that language
 
04:00:08.149 --> 04:00:08.159 align:start position:0%
what the person reasonably believes to
 
04:00:09.830 --> 04:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
be a crime because we were concerned
 
04:00:12.070 --> 04:00:12.080 align:start position:0%
that there's a lot of things
 
04:00:15.110 --> 04:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
colloquially said for example people say
 
04:00:17.590 --> 04:00:17.600 align:start position:0%
so and so is harassing me or so and so
 
04:00:19.550 --> 04:00:19.560 align:start position:0%
is stalking me or so and so is
 
04:00:22.469 --> 04:00:22.479 align:start position:0%
threatening me and those are all crimes
 
04:00:24.790 --> 04:00:24.800 align:start position:0%
under New Hampshire law harassment
 
04:00:27.110 --> 04:00:27.120 align:start position:0%
threatening but all those crimes have
 
04:00:29.030 --> 04:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
elements and we didn't want someone to
 
04:00:31.510 --> 04:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
have to say well does it actually meet
 
04:00:34.309 --> 04:00:34.319 align:start position:0%
the elements of the crime we figured
 
04:00:36.030 --> 04:00:36.040 align:start position:0%
that if a person felt that they were
 
04:00:38.309 --> 04:00:38.319 align:start position:0%
being reasonably felt like they were
 
04:00:40.830 --> 04:00:40.840 align:start position:0%
being harassed or threatened in a way
 
04:00:43.590 --> 04:00:43.600 align:start position:0%
that they felt violated the law they
 
04:00:45.269 --> 04:00:45.279 align:start position:0%
would be able to record it and we didn't
 
04:00:47.510 --> 04:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
want it to be a nitpicky thing where
 
04:00:49.229 --> 04:00:49.239 align:start position:0%
like oh you didn't meet you didn't
 
04:00:50.510 --> 04:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
completely Meet The Elements of
 
04:00:52.189 --> 04:00:52.199 align:start position:0%
harassment therefore you don't fit in
 
04:00:52.199 --> 04:00:53.030 align:start position:0%
harassment therefore you don't fit in
this

04:00:53.030 --> 04:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:00:56.870 --> 04:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
exception we also um we did start out
 
04:00:59.830 --> 04:00:59.840 align:start position:0%
with this just being contains or
 
04:01:01.469 --> 04:01:01.479 align:start position:0%
evidence of what the person reasonably
 
04:01:03.149 --> 04:01:03.159 align:start position:0%
believes to be domestic
 
04:01:05.950 --> 04:01:05.960 align:start position:0%
violence but the difficulty is this
 
04:01:07.630 --> 04:01:07.640 align:start position:0%
certainly comes up in domestic violence
 
04:01:10.030 --> 04:01:10.040 align:start position:0%
cases but it comes up in other cases as
 
04:01:13.429 --> 04:01:13.439 align:start position:0%
well and I say that because I had a case
 
04:01:15.349 --> 04:01:15.359 align:start position:0%
where we had a neighbor dispute these
 
04:01:17.630 --> 04:01:17.640 align:start position:0%
two neighbors are arguing with each
 
04:01:20.990 --> 04:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
other and they go to the police and the
 
04:01:23.910 --> 04:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
police give them the advice that I I
 
04:01:25.830 --> 04:01:25.840 align:start position:0%
said earlier which is document
 
04:01:27.910 --> 04:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
everything so one of the neighbors is
 
04:01:30.389 --> 04:01:30.399 align:start position:0%
walking the property line and he sees
 
04:01:32.229 --> 04:01:32.239 align:start position:0%
his other neighbor who starts coming
 
04:01:34.149 --> 04:01:34.159 align:start position:0%
toward him and he takes he's actually
 
04:01:35.830 --> 04:01:35.840 align:start position:0%
sitting in his car and he takes out his
 
04:01:37.710 --> 04:01:37.720 align:start position:0%
phone and he's holding it in a way that
 
04:01:39.750 --> 04:01:39.760 align:start position:0%
the other neighbor can't necessarily see
 
04:01:42.269 --> 04:01:42.279 align:start position:0%
it and we have a recording of the other
 
04:01:44.309 --> 04:01:44.319 align:start position:0%
neighbor coming over to his open window
 
04:01:46.149 --> 04:01:46.159 align:start position:0%
and punching him repeatedly or punching
 
04:01:47.830 --> 04:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
him through the
 
04:01:51.950 --> 04:01:51.960 align:start position:0%
window and unfortunately we got a motion
 
04:01:54.830 --> 04:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
suppress that recording and the judge
 
04:01:56.670 --> 04:01:56.680 align:start position:0%
granted the motion to suppress under the
 
04:01:59.070 --> 04:01:59.080 align:start position:0%
current wiretap statute and said
 
04:02:01.590 --> 04:02:01.600 align:start position:0%
essentially you know it's a shame that I
 
04:02:04.389 --> 04:02:04.399 align:start position:0%
have to suppress this because the jury
 
04:02:06.389 --> 04:02:06.399 align:start position:0%
should be able to see this
 
04:02:09.710 --> 04:02:09.720 align:start position:0%
video this should be part of the trial
 
04:02:11.349 --> 04:02:11.359 align:start position:0%
but because this runs a foul of the
 
04:02:14.590 --> 04:02:14.600 align:start position:0%
wiretap statute I I can't let
 
04:02:14.600 --> 04:02:16.790 align:start position:0%
wiretap statute I I can't let
in

04:02:16.790 --> 04:02:16.800 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:02:19.229 --> 04:02:19.239 align:start position:0%
so we felt that we didn't want to limit
 
04:02:21.189 --> 04:02:21.199 align:start position:0%
this specifically to crimes domestic
 
04:02:23.469 --> 04:02:23.479 align:start position:0%
violence that if there was a neighbor
 
04:02:25.469 --> 04:02:25.479 align:start position:0%
dispute if essentially you were walking
 
04:02:27.710 --> 04:02:27.720 align:start position:0%
down the street and someone came up
 
04:02:29.630 --> 04:02:29.640 align:start position:0%
behind you yelling I'm going to murder
 
04:02:31.670 --> 04:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
you you could take out your phone and
 
04:02:34.229 --> 04:02:34.239 align:start position:0%
start recording that and not run a foul
 
04:02:37.910 --> 04:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
of the wiretap statute so I would I
 
04:02:40.550 --> 04:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
would urge you to pass this language um
 
04:02:42.149 --> 04:02:42.159 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any questions they
 
04:02:44.269 --> 04:02:44.279 align:start position:0%
may have are there any questions rep
 
04:02:47.309 --> 04:02:47.319 align:start position:0%
representative McFarland thank you Mr
 
04:02:50.510 --> 04:02:50.520 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for your testimony um
 
04:02:53.830 --> 04:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:56.950 --> 04:02:56.960 align:start position:0%
context you explained why you
 
04:03:00.229 --> 04:03:00.239 align:start position:0%
contemplated these particular
 
04:03:02.710 --> 04:03:02.720 align:start position:0%
exemptions you you will know of course
 
04:03:05.910 --> 04:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
that the the statute also contains an
 
04:03:08.830 --> 04:03:08.840 align:start position:0%
exemption for law enforcement officers
 
04:03:12.389 --> 04:03:12.399 align:start position:0%
uh to make body warn recordings yes if
 
04:03:16.149 --> 04:03:16.159 align:start position:0%
you know that private citizens in their
 
04:03:19.510 --> 04:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
vehicles and from time to time on their
 
04:03:22.590 --> 04:03:22.600 align:start position:0%
persons seek to use those kind of a
 
04:03:25.510 --> 04:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
video camera and audio recording uh
 
04:03:28.469 --> 04:03:28.479 align:start position:0%
mechanisms to preserve and document
 
04:03:30.750 --> 04:03:30.760 align:start position:0%
evidence what's your point of view on
 
04:03:33.469 --> 04:03:33.479 align:start position:0%
whether there should be an exemption for
 
04:03:37.349 --> 04:03:37.359 align:start position:0%
either a bodyw warn recording device or
 
04:03:40.389 --> 04:03:40.399 align:start position:0%
uh a carborn recording
 
04:03:44.990 --> 04:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
device so normally with a a like a dash
 
04:03:48.309 --> 04:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
cam there's not an audio outside of the
 
04:03:48.319 --> 04:03:49.710 align:start position:0%
cam there's not an audio outside of the
vehicle

04:03:49.710 --> 04:03:49.720 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
04:03:52.830 --> 04:03:52.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily where the other thing is
 
04:03:55.070 --> 04:03:55.080 align:start position:0%
when you start looking at the
 
04:03:55.080 --> 04:03:56.590 align:start position:0%
when you start looking at the
definitions

04:03:56.590 --> 04:03:56.600 align:start position:0%
definitions
 
04:03:56.600 --> 04:03:58.110 align:start position:0%
definitions
in

04:03:58.110 --> 04:03:58.120 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:04:01.110 --> 04:04:01.120 align:start position:0%
um the wi tapping
 
04:04:03.429 --> 04:04:03.439 align:start position:0%
statute oral
 
04:04:06.110 --> 04:04:06.120 align:start position:0%
communication um is defined as any
 
04:04:08.550 --> 04:04:08.560 align:start position:0%
verbal communication uttered by a person
 
04:04:10.910 --> 04:04:10.920 align:start position:0%
who has a reasonable expectation that
 
04:04:12.710 --> 04:04:12.720 align:start position:0%
the communication is not subject to
 
04:04:15.349 --> 04:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
interception under circumstances
 
04:04:17.429 --> 04:04:17.439 align:start position:0%
justifying that
 
04:04:21.229 --> 04:04:21.239 align:start position:0%
expectation so for example if you pulled
 
04:04:23.149 --> 04:04:23.159 align:start position:0%
out your phone right now and started
 
04:04:26.070 --> 04:04:26.080 align:start position:0%
recording me that wouldn't be a crime
 
04:04:29.070 --> 04:04:29.080 align:start position:0%
because I have no reasonable expectation
 
04:04:30.510 --> 04:04:30.520 align:start position:0%
that the proceedings right now are not
 
04:04:32.510 --> 04:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
being subject to intercept in fact the
 
04:04:34.630 --> 04:04:34.640 align:start position:0%
opposite I know that they're being
 
04:04:38.110 --> 04:04:38.120 align:start position:0%
broadcast um on on YouTube or whatever
 
04:04:40.110 --> 04:04:40.120 align:start position:0%
it is
 
04:04:44.349 --> 04:04:44.359 align:start position:0%
um so with reference to body
 
04:04:46.790 --> 04:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
cameras I think that the exception that
 
04:04:48.790 --> 04:04:48.800 align:start position:0%
was put in the wir tab statute for body
 
04:04:52.510 --> 04:04:52.520 align:start position:0%
warn cameras was just to be extra safe
 
04:04:54.870 --> 04:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
um law enforcement officers have to be
 
04:04:57.030 --> 04:04:57.040 align:start position:0%
in uniform wearing bodyw warn cameras
 
04:05:00.189 --> 04:05:00.199 align:start position:0%
they have to let the person know by
 
04:05:02.670 --> 04:05:02.680 align:start position:0%
Statute through 105 D2 that they're
 
04:05:05.070 --> 04:05:05.080 align:start position:0%
being recorded so I don't think you can
 
04:05:07.670 --> 04:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily make the argument that I had
 
04:05:10.469 --> 04:05:10.479 align:start position:0%
no idea I was being recorded by a police
 
04:05:12.269 --> 04:05:12.279 align:start position:0%
officer who's wearing this obvious
 
04:05:14.149 --> 04:05:14.159 align:start position:0%
camera on their uniform and telling me
 
04:05:15.189 --> 04:05:15.199 align:start position:0%
I'm being
 
04:05:19.149 --> 04:05:19.159 align:start position:0%
recorded um in terms of I don't know
 
04:05:20.830 --> 04:05:20.840 align:start position:0%
that we necessarily have non-law
 
04:05:22.990 --> 04:05:23.000 align:start position:0%
Enforcement Officers utilizing body warn
 
04:05:26.510 --> 04:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
cameras but if a person decided to take
 
04:05:28.670 --> 04:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
a GoPro and strap it to their chest and
 
04:05:31.590 --> 04:05:31.600 align:start position:0%
walk around I don't think that's a crime
 
04:05:33.309 --> 04:05:33.319 align:start position:0%
because if I see a person with a GoPro
 
04:05:35.630 --> 04:05:35.640 align:start position:0%
on their chest I don't have a reasonable
 
04:05:37.309 --> 04:05:37.319 align:start position:0%
expectation that I'm not being recorded
 
04:05:38.710 --> 04:05:38.720 align:start position:0%
at that
 
04:05:42.469 --> 04:05:42.479 align:start position:0%
point Thank you thank you representative
 
04:05:45.149 --> 04:05:45.159 align:start position:0%
tur yes thank thank you and thanks for
 
04:05:46.269 --> 04:05:46.279 align:start position:0%
taking the question I just want to
 
04:05:49.030 --> 04:05:49.040 align:start position:0%
clarify is it your sort of testimony
 
04:05:51.670 --> 04:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
that uh this would
 
04:05:55.590 --> 04:05:55.600 align:start position:0%
be reasonable to expand just all violent
 
04:05:57.910 --> 04:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
crimes is that is that sort of a a
 
04:06:00.229 --> 04:06:00.239 align:start position:0%
reasonable modification of this to cover
 
04:06:02.550 --> 04:06:02.560 align:start position:0%
domestic violence and then any other and
 
04:06:03.830 --> 04:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
I don't know whether the term violent
 
04:06:05.469 --> 04:06:05.479 align:start position:0%
crime needs to be defined but that's
 
04:06:07.389 --> 04:06:07.399 align:start position:0%
really the question I think as it's
 
04:06:11.389 --> 04:06:11.399 align:start position:0%
written right now it covers all crime
 
04:06:13.149 --> 04:06:13.159 align:start position:0%
whether it's domestic violence whether
 
04:06:15.429 --> 04:06:15.439 align:start position:0%
it's vient crime or whether it's just
 
04:06:20.630 --> 04:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
crime in general because we use in uh
 
04:06:23.149 --> 04:06:23.159 align:start position:0%
line seven that paragraph
 
04:06:25.870 --> 04:06:25.880 align:start position:0%
two evidence that of what the person
 
04:06:30.030 --> 04:06:30.040 align:start position:0%
reasonably believes to be a crime so I
 
04:06:32.710 --> 04:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
mean I guess theoretically
 
04:06:35.309 --> 04:06:35.319 align:start position:0%
if if I was in a car with someone who
 
04:06:37.309 --> 04:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
was speeding or driving in a manner that
 
04:06:39.750 --> 04:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
I thought was Reckless and I felt that I
 
04:06:42.229 --> 04:06:42.239 align:start position:0%
wanted to record that surreptitiously
 
04:06:44.750 --> 04:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
and provide it to the police as evidence
 
04:06:47.070 --> 04:06:47.080 align:start position:0%
this would cover me under as an
 
04:06:49.030 --> 04:06:49.040 align:start position:0%
exception okay so so you think it's
 
04:06:50.990 --> 04:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
already even broader than than violent
 
04:06:53.110 --> 04:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
crime it really covers all I do I think
 
04:06:55.429 --> 04:06:55.439 align:start position:0%
it covers all crime and for me
 
04:06:57.790 --> 04:06:57.800 align:start position:0%
personally I think that's appropriate
 
04:06:59.990 --> 04:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
because I don't want to start parsing
 
04:07:02.030 --> 04:07:02.040 align:start position:0%
out what crime you can record and what
 
04:07:04.990 --> 04:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
crime you can't record representative
 
04:07:08.110 --> 04:07:08.120 align:start position:0%
Morton thank you chairman thank you for
 
04:07:11.229 --> 04:07:11.239 align:start position:0%
uh this question um where do uh like
 
04:07:13.910 --> 04:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
ring or Nest those types of camera
 
04:07:16.910 --> 04:07:16.920 align:start position:0%
systems or or similar things come into
 
04:07:19.910 --> 04:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
play because obviously you walk up to a
 
04:07:22.750 --> 04:07:22.760 align:start position:0%
house you can see it but not necessarily
 
04:07:24.870 --> 04:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
somebody might have like Vines growing
 
04:07:26.750 --> 04:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
up or whatever and you don't necessarily
 
04:07:29.229 --> 04:07:29.239 align:start position:0%
see the camera where does that fall is
 
04:07:31.510 --> 04:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
that a gray area I I think that is a
 
04:07:34.469 --> 04:07:34.479 align:start position:0%
gray area again I would go back to that
 
04:07:36.910 --> 04:07:36.920 align:start position:0%
definition of oral communication I don't
 
04:07:36.920 --> 04:07:37.950 align:start position:0%
definition of oral communication I don't
know

04:07:37.950 --> 04:07:37.960 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:07:39.870 --> 04:07:39.880 align:start position:0%
that in
 
04:07:43.590 --> 04:07:43.600 align:start position:0%
2025 I can have a reasonable expectation
 
04:07:45.510 --> 04:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
that I'm not being subject to intercepts
 
04:07:47.550 --> 04:07:47.560 align:start position:0%
standing on someone's front porch
 
04:07:50.830 --> 04:07:50.840 align:start position:0%
because there is such a proliferation of
 
04:07:53.349 --> 04:07:53.359 align:start position:0%
ring cameras and that type of thing and
 
04:07:55.389 --> 04:07:55.399 align:start position:0%
it again the difficulty is that the
 
04:07:58.750 --> 04:07:58.760 align:start position:0%
wiretap statute written in
 
04:08:02.750 --> 04:08:02.760 align:start position:0%
1969 and a lot of the things within it
 
04:08:02.760 --> 04:08:03.990 align:start position:0%
1969 and a lot of the things within it
aren't

04:08:03.990 --> 04:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
aren't
 
04:08:06.990 --> 04:08:07.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily applic applicable to the
 
04:08:11.109 --> 04:08:11.119 align:start position:0%
modern world that we live in now and I
 
04:08:14.710 --> 04:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
can tell you one of the concerns I
 
04:08:18.670 --> 04:08:18.680 align:start position:0%
personally have is if you yell hey Siri
 
04:08:21.149 --> 04:08:21.159 align:start position:0%
loud enough half half the phones in the
 
04:08:25.429 --> 04:08:25.439 align:start position:0%
room click because those phones are
 
04:08:28.030 --> 04:08:28.040 align:start position:0%
listening into our conversations at all
 
04:08:31.550 --> 04:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
times L just did yes
 
04:08:34.950 --> 04:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
so I mean I had I had a conversation
 
04:08:36.670 --> 04:08:36.680 align:start position:0%
with another attorney in my office we
 
04:08:37.990 --> 04:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
were talking about this statute and I
 
04:08:39.469 --> 04:08:39.479 align:start position:0%
said' what what about right now do you
 
04:08:40.790 --> 04:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
think we're being subject to
 
04:08:42.750 --> 04:08:42.760 align:start position:0%
interception he's like well absolutely
 
04:08:42.760 --> 04:08:44.349 align:start position:0%
interception he's like well absolutely
not

04:08:44.349 --> 04:08:44.359 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:08:46.030 --> 04:08:46.040 align:start position:0%
and I yelled hey Siri do I need a rain
 
04:08:48.750 --> 04:08:48.760 align:start position:0%
coat and my phone goes beep beep no it's
 
04:08:51.750 --> 04:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
not raining today and I'm like see that
 
04:08:55.030 --> 04:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
we're being intercepted right now so I I
 
04:08:57.349 --> 04:08:57.359 align:start position:0%
think that the entire wiretap statute
 
04:09:01.469 --> 04:09:01.479 align:start position:0%
you know is is due for a 2025 update I
 
04:09:04.149 --> 04:09:04.159 align:start position:0%
think that's a monumentally large task
 
04:09:06.950 --> 04:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
though um I can tell you this the
 
04:09:09.229 --> 04:09:09.239 align:start position:0%
wiretap statute as it exists now is
 
04:09:12.189 --> 04:09:12.199 align:start position:0%
copied Almost 100% from the federal law
 
04:09:18.309 --> 04:09:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:20.149 --> 04:09:20.159 align:start position:0%
ask for follow up all right Morton you
 
04:09:23.149 --> 04:09:23.159 align:start position:0%
ask for followup oh representative
 
04:09:25.510 --> 04:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
trip thank you chairman thank you for
 
04:09:28.070 --> 04:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:09:31.030 --> 04:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh it's it's interesting that uh when
 
04:09:33.910 --> 04:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
you read the wiretap law it only had to
 
04:09:36.429 --> 04:09:36.439 align:start position:0%
deal with audio recordings I believe it
 
04:09:39.030 --> 04:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
didn't have anything to do with uh uh
 
04:09:41.710 --> 04:09:41.720 align:start position:0%
video recordings correct does this law
 
04:09:45.429 --> 04:09:45.439 align:start position:0%
do anything with regards to uh uh
 
04:09:48.550 --> 04:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
permitting videos to be recorded
 
04:09:51.229 --> 04:09:51.239 align:start position:0%
and it so it wouldn't affect video at
 
04:09:53.510 --> 04:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
all because again the wir tap statute is
 
04:09:57.269 --> 04:09:57.279 align:start position:0%
only audio recordings so I can
 
04:10:00.269 --> 04:10:00.279 align:start position:0%
theoretically surreptitiously videotape
 
04:10:02.429 --> 04:10:02.439 align:start position:0%
someone unless they're in like a a
 
04:10:03.830 --> 04:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
locker room or that type of thing where
 
04:10:07.269 --> 04:10:07.279 align:start position:0%
you end up with a a violation of privacy
 
04:10:07.279 --> 04:10:09.109 align:start position:0%
you end up with a a violation of privacy
violation

04:10:09.109 --> 04:10:09.119 align:start position:0%
violation
 
04:10:12.550 --> 04:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
but if I just was videotaping with no
 
04:10:14.950 --> 04:10:14.960 align:start position:0%
audio you wouldn't run a foul of the
 
04:10:14.960 --> 04:10:17.229 align:start position:0%
audio you wouldn't run a foul of the
wiretap

04:10:17.229 --> 04:10:17.239 align:start position:0%
wiretap
 
04:10:21.469 --> 04:10:21.479 align:start position:0%
statute thank you representative MOS
 
04:10:22.950 --> 04:10:22.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:10:25.189 --> 04:10:25.199 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm wondering about
 
04:10:30.670 --> 04:10:30.680 align:start position:0%
um exculpatory evidence and whether this
 
04:10:33.990 --> 04:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
uh whether this bill would implicitly
 
04:10:36.870 --> 04:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
create a right on the part of the other
 
04:10:38.630 --> 04:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
person to the
 
04:10:43.670 --> 04:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
interaction um to record for purposes of
 
04:10:46.269 --> 04:10:46.279 align:start position:0%
culpatory uh
 
04:10:50.269 --> 04:10:50.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:52.910 --> 04:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
would it would create an exception to
 
04:10:55.429 --> 04:10:55.439 align:start position:0%
record to give to law enforcement for
 
04:10:57.670 --> 04:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
for the purposes in the
 
04:11:03.269 --> 04:11:03.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:06.590 --> 04:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
were I guess if I understand your
 
04:11:09.510 --> 04:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
question you're asking if the person
 
04:11:11.990 --> 04:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
that we're considering the batterer in
 
04:11:14.910 --> 04:11:14.920 align:start position:0%
the relationship decid to record and
 
04:11:16.870 --> 04:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
they provide that recording to law
 
04:11:19.309 --> 04:11:19.319 align:start position:0%
enforcement I think that would be a
 
04:11:21.590 --> 04:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
legal recording because they could
 
04:11:24.030 --> 04:11:24.040 align:start position:0%
certainly make the argument that they
 
04:11:26.469 --> 04:11:26.479 align:start position:0%
reasonably believed that they're filming
 
04:11:28.830 --> 04:11:28.840 align:start position:0%
the crime of of perhaps false report or
 
04:11:32.990 --> 04:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
that type of thing um so I do think that
 
04:11:36.030 --> 04:11:36.040 align:start position:0%
it would it goes both ways in terms of
 
04:11:36.040 --> 04:11:41.109 align:start position:0%
it would it goes both ways in terms of
everyone

04:11:41.109 --> 04:11:41.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:44.030 --> 04:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
recording representative McFarland
 
04:11:45.229 --> 04:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
04:11:47.269 --> 04:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
chairman I was going to ask a different
 
04:11:49.750 --> 04:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
question which I I'm still interested by
 
04:11:52.229 --> 04:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
but I I think the more important one
 
04:11:56.429 --> 04:11:56.439 align:start position:0%
you're asserting that the uh the RSA uh
 
04:11:59.309 --> 04:11:59.319 align:start position:0%
chapter 578 that we're discussing here
 
04:12:04.590 --> 04:12:04.600 align:start position:0%
is focused on voice correct and um can
 
04:12:08.109 --> 04:12:08.119 align:start position:0%
you explain then while I understand that
 
04:12:10.870 --> 04:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
the oral communication definition in
 
04:12:12.309 --> 04:12:12.319 align:start position:0%
that chapter aligns with what you're
 
04:12:15.109 --> 04:12:15.119 align:start position:0%
saying um if I know that the the
 
04:12:16.590 --> 04:12:16.600 align:start position:0%
definition of
 
04:12:18.990 --> 04:12:19.000 align:start position:0%
telecommunication is the transfer of any
 
04:12:21.229 --> 04:12:21.239 align:start position:0%
form of information in whole or in part
 
04:12:22.830 --> 04:12:22.840 align:start position:0%
through the facilities of communications
 
04:12:25.109 --> 04:12:25.119 align:start position:0%
common carrier and goes
 
04:12:29.830 --> 04:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
on does it not in fact cover only Audio
 
04:12:33.229 --> 04:12:33.239 align:start position:0%
Communications in person in without the
 
04:12:35.269 --> 04:12:35.279 align:start position:0%
use of a common Communications carrier
 
04:12:37.990 --> 04:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
but on as soon as you start to involve a
 
04:12:40.389 --> 04:12:40.399 align:start position:0%
Communications carrier it can extend to
 
04:12:42.790 --> 04:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
data and video and voice and all manner
 
04:12:42.800 --> 04:12:50.149 align:start position:0%
data and video and voice and all manner
of

04:12:50.149 --> 04:12:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:54.149 --> 04:12:54.159 align:start position:0%
information so the telecommun
 
04:12:56.429 --> 04:12:56.439 align:start position:0%
telecommunication part of
 
04:13:00.510 --> 04:13:00.520 align:start position:0%
this does in fact go beyond does have
 
04:13:07.030 --> 04:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:07.040 --> 04:13:08.750 align:start position:0%
 
it

04:13:08.750 --> 04:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:13:11.349 --> 04:13:11.359 align:start position:0%
however if you're intercepting a
 
04:13:11.359 --> 04:13:13.790 align:start position:0%
however if you're intercepting a
telecommunication

04:13:13.790 --> 04:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
telecommunication
 
04:13:15.590 --> 04:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
that's different than filming something
 
04:13:16.950 --> 04:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
that's occurring
 
04:13:19.469 --> 04:13:19.479 align:start position:0%
live so if I'm filming something that's
 
04:13:22.870 --> 04:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
occurring live I'm not intercepting a
 
04:13:26.109 --> 04:13:26.119 align:start position:0%
telecommunication if I'm able to you
 
04:13:29.309 --> 04:13:29.319 align:start position:0%
know somehow get up on a telephone pole
 
04:13:32.830 --> 04:13:32.840 align:start position:0%
and put some alligator clips on the wire
 
04:13:37.070 --> 04:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
or you know take these these cell phone
 
04:13:40.910 --> 04:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
signals and somehow capture them and
 
04:13:44.229 --> 04:13:44.239 align:start position:0%
pull them in and scramble them and
 
04:13:48.229 --> 04:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
understand them I'm intercepting a
 
04:13:50.630 --> 04:13:50.640 align:start position:0%
telecommunication um that's not where we
 
04:13:53.269 --> 04:13:53.279 align:start position:0%
normally see the wiretap statue being
 
04:13:55.750 --> 04:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
violated now where we see it being
 
04:13:58.349 --> 04:13:58.359 align:start position:0%
violated is the acquisition of oral
 
04:14:01.870 --> 04:14:01.880 align:start position:0%
communication so it's the people talking
 
04:14:03.830 --> 04:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
that type of thing because the the
 
04:14:06.990 --> 04:14:07.000 align:start position:0%
telecommunication part really requires a
 
04:14:08.990 --> 04:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
level of sophistication that we don't
 
04:14:11.790 --> 04:14:11.800 align:start position:0%
generally see now very quick followup if
 
04:14:14.429 --> 04:14:14.439 align:start position:0%
I may well
 
04:14:17.309 --> 04:14:17.319 align:start position:0%
would you agree that if I was simply to
 
04:14:22.070 --> 04:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
take my cell phone and video record a
 
04:14:25.469 --> 04:14:25.479 align:start position:0%
zoom that that would include capturing
 
04:14:27.590 --> 04:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
the video data as part of
 
04:14:30.349 --> 04:14:30.359 align:start position:0%
telecommunication as as defined
 
04:14:30.359 --> 04:14:38.830 align:start position:0%

04:14:38.830 --> 04:14:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:42.710 --> 04:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
I I don't believe it would because I
 
04:14:45.910 --> 04:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
don't think that you are getting the
 
04:14:48.429 --> 04:14:48.439 align:start position:0%
information in whole or in part through
 
04:14:50.750 --> 04:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
the facilities of communications common
 
04:14:54.790 --> 04:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
car here just like recording a phone
 
04:14:57.149 --> 04:14:57.159 align:start position:0%
call I don't think is an interception of
 
04:14:57.159 --> 04:14:58.149 align:start position:0%
call I don't think is an interception of
a

04:14:58.149 --> 04:14:58.159 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:15:00.189 --> 04:15:00.199 align:start position:0%
telecommunication if I hold a tape
 
04:15:02.550 --> 04:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
recorder up to the phone I think I'm
 
04:15:04.670 --> 04:15:04.680 align:start position:0%
intercepting an oral
 
04:15:06.870 --> 04:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
communication whereas I don't think I'm
 
04:15:08.229 --> 04:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
intercepting at
 
04:15:10.510 --> 04:15:10.520 align:start position:0%
telecommunication unless I'm taking it
 
04:15:13.189 --> 04:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
from the common carrier if that Mak
 
04:15:14.710 --> 04:15:14.720 align:start position:0%
sense thank
 
04:15:16.990 --> 04:15:17.000 align:start position:0%
you any other questions representative
 
04:15:19.750 --> 04:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
Morton uh yes so I have a question in
 
04:15:21.830 --> 04:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
terms of state by state I think
 
04:15:23.790 --> 04:15:23.800 align:start position:0%
representative Reed mentioned Tennessee
 
04:15:25.550 --> 04:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
was another state that has already
 
04:15:28.109 --> 04:15:28.119 align:start position:0%
passed this um how many other states
 
04:15:30.550 --> 04:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
have passed something like this that I'm
 
04:15:34.109 --> 04:15:34.119 align:start position:0%
not sure about um I knew that there was
 
04:15:36.950 --> 04:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
a comment earlier about there's a
 
04:15:38.750 --> 04:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
majority of states are one party states
 
04:15:40.349 --> 04:15:40.359 align:start position:0%
in the sense
 
04:15:42.990 --> 04:15:43.000 align:start position:0%
that I'm being told from the audience 38
 
04:15:45.149 --> 04:15:45.159 align:start position:0%
states are one party States meaning that
 
04:15:46.830 --> 04:15:46.840 align:start position:0%
if one person is aware of the recording
 
04:15:49.389 --> 04:15:49.399 align:start position:0%
then the recording is
 
04:15:52.189 --> 04:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
legal any other questions representative
 
04:15:54.870 --> 04:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
TR yeah thanks thanks for taking the
 
04:15:59.070 --> 04:15:59.080 align:start position:0%
question um I I don't want to over over
 
04:16:01.469 --> 04:16:01.479 align:start position:0%
specify things in the public hearing but
 
04:16:04.189 --> 04:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
this question about modifying the uh
 
04:16:06.990 --> 04:16:07.000 align:start position:0%
bill to make it clear that this should
 
04:16:09.550 --> 04:16:09.560 align:start position:0%
be used only for the purposes of legal
 
04:16:13.030 --> 04:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
proceedings the the language that I was
 
04:16:14.750 --> 04:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
was proposed a few minuts ago as maybe
 
04:16:17.229 --> 04:16:17.239 align:start position:0%
solely and I'm worried about that
 
04:16:19.990 --> 04:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
Concept in terms of if someone shares it
 
04:16:22.109 --> 04:16:22.119 align:start position:0%
with a family member if someone shares
 
04:16:23.830 --> 04:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
it with their legal councel or if
 
04:16:27.109 --> 04:16:27.119 align:start position:0%
someone it would you think that pro pro
 
04:16:29.469 --> 04:16:29.479 align:start position:0%
prohibiting public disclosure or knowing
 
04:16:31.030 --> 04:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
public disclosure would be a better
 
04:16:33.189 --> 04:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
approach I just and and we can talk
 
04:16:35.149 --> 04:16:35.159 align:start position:0%
about language separately but I just was
 
04:16:37.149 --> 04:16:37.159 align:start position:0%
wondering what your thoughts were and
 
04:16:38.710 --> 04:16:38.720 align:start position:0%
that is something that we had discussed
 
04:16:41.269 --> 04:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
in the in the subcommittee is providing
 
04:16:44.030 --> 04:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
it to your attorney providing it maybe
 
04:16:49.910 --> 04:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:49.920 --> 04:16:52.670 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:16:52.670 --> 04:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:56.109 --> 04:16:56.119 align:start position:0%
and again we never addressed the concern
 
04:16:59.590 --> 04:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
of sort of simultaneously posting it on
 
04:17:02.109 --> 04:17:02.119 align:start position:0%
social media
 
04:17:06.229 --> 04:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
um that didn't come up so I'm not sure
 
04:17:09.149 --> 04:17:09.159 align:start position:0%
what would what the best way to to word
 
04:17:11.429 --> 04:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
04:17:15.229 --> 04:17:15.239 align:start position:0%
um cuz again we did want to leave it
 
04:17:18.149 --> 04:17:18.159 align:start position:0%
broad if you reasonably believe you're
 
04:17:19.429 --> 04:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
the victim of a crime and you're
 
04:17:21.510 --> 04:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
recording it with the intent to give it
 
04:17:24.990 --> 04:17:25.000 align:start position:0%
to the police or use it in court we
 
04:17:28.189 --> 04:17:28.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:29.870 --> 04:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
exception any of questions
 
04:17:29.880 --> 04:17:31.269 align:start position:0%
exception any of questions
representative

04:17:31.269 --> 04:17:31.279 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:17:33.630 --> 04:17:33.640 align:start position:0%
trip thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
04:17:39.429 --> 04:17:39.439 align:start position:0%
taking my question so if I was to make a
 
04:17:43.550 --> 04:17:43.560 align:start position:0%
video recording of a domestic abuse
 
04:17:47.389 --> 04:17:47.399 align:start position:0%
situation and I was to mute the audio
 
04:17:48.950 --> 04:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
would it be against the law to put that
 
04:17:51.670 --> 04:17:51.680 align:start position:0%
on uh me social
 
04:17:55.590 --> 04:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
media no law that I'm aware of thank
 
04:17:58.910 --> 04:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
you any other questions seeing none
 
04:18:00.910 --> 04:18:00.920 align:start position:0%
thank you thank
 
04:18:10.189 --> 04:18:10.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:12.269 --> 04:18:12.279 align:start position:0%
suckling I assume the read light means
 
04:18:13.990 --> 04:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
I'm good to go you're good to go my body
 
04:18:15.790 --> 04:18:15.800 align:start position:0%
camera is not running just so everyone's
 
04:18:19.389 --> 04:18:19.399 align:start position:0%
aware um thank you for having me today
 
04:18:21.149 --> 04:18:21.159 align:start position:0%
um I was totally unprepared for this I
 
04:18:23.030 --> 04:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
came in for another bill and sat down
 
04:18:24.710 --> 04:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
and and read this and heard the
 
04:18:26.189 --> 04:18:26.199 align:start position:0%
testimony and thought I'd thought I'd
 
04:18:28.269 --> 04:18:28.279 align:start position:0%
chime in so bear with me as I fumble
 
04:18:30.269 --> 04:18:30.279 align:start position:0%
through this I'm a chief of police in
 
04:18:32.910 --> 04:18:32.920 align:start position:0%
the town of Alexandria uh we have, 1600
 
04:18:35.590 --> 04:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
residents and two police officers so I'm
 
04:18:38.550 --> 04:18:38.560 align:start position:0%
half of the department um when I say
 
04:18:40.670 --> 04:18:40.680 align:start position:0%
that we're busy we're incredibly busy we
 
04:18:42.429 --> 04:18:42.439 align:start position:0%
arrest around 10% of the population
 
04:18:46.149 --> 04:18:46.159 align:start position:0%
every year and um yeah that's about 160
 
04:18:48.510 --> 04:18:48.520 align:start position:0%
arrests and a lot of them are domestic
 
04:18:51.030 --> 04:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
violence um I've been through two
 
04:18:54.389 --> 04:18:54.399 align:start position:0%
policey and I had countless hours of
 
04:18:56.990 --> 04:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
training on domestic violence and the
 
04:18:58.990 --> 04:18:59.000 align:start position:0%
relationship between her abuser and
 
04:19:01.830 --> 04:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
abused uh we're often told that domestic
 
04:19:04.309 --> 04:19:04.319 align:start position:0%
violence is about power and control and
 
04:19:06.429 --> 04:19:06.439 align:start position:0%
the relationship between the power and
 
04:19:10.510 --> 04:19:10.520 align:start position:0%
control and we arrive at a domestic
 
04:19:14.550 --> 04:19:14.560 align:start position:0%
violence situation and and quite often
 
04:19:16.189 --> 04:19:16.199 align:start position:0%
they're very complex and they're very
 
04:19:18.429 --> 04:19:18.439 align:start position:0%
hard to understand when we're there at
 
04:19:21.269 --> 04:19:21.279 align:start position:0%
the last moment these are very complex
 
04:19:22.950 --> 04:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
cases for us sometimes sometimes they're
 
04:19:24.630 --> 04:19:24.640 align:start position:0%
very obvious but to understand the
 
04:19:26.590 --> 04:19:26.600 align:start position:0%
relationship between an AB abused and
 
04:19:29.990 --> 04:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
abuser can be very very tricky um
 
04:19:32.550 --> 04:19:32.560 align:start position:0%
they're often exent we're looking to
 
04:19:35.429 --> 04:19:35.439 align:start position:0%
deal with this then and there uh rather
 
04:19:38.389 --> 04:19:38.399 align:start position:0%
than a prolonged investigation because
 
04:19:42.309 --> 04:19:42.319 align:start position:0%
um uh victims deserve that they deserve
 
04:19:45.030 --> 04:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
that Justice and potentially it could be
 
04:19:47.750 --> 04:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
a life-saving arrest uh if we left
 
04:19:50.750 --> 04:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
without it I would welcome any Tool uh
 
04:19:53.189 --> 04:19:53.199 align:start position:0%
that we could to help with the
 
04:19:55.229 --> 04:19:55.239 align:start position:0%
prosecution of domestic violence and
 
04:19:57.109 --> 04:19:57.119 align:start position:0%
also understanding during our
 
04:19:59.229 --> 04:19:59.239 align:start position:0%
investigation uh with any kind of
 
04:20:01.870 --> 04:20:01.880 align:start position:0%
information that we can get uh to to
 
04:20:04.630 --> 04:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
help with that investigation um I
 
04:20:07.590 --> 04:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
support this bill um and as law
 
04:20:10.109 --> 04:20:10.119 align:start position:0%
enforcement we want to get it right
 
04:20:12.149 --> 04:20:12.159 align:start position:0%
every opportunity that we can we want to
 
04:20:13.630 --> 04:20:13.640 align:start position:0%
get it right we don't want to arrest the
 
04:20:15.950 --> 04:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
wrong person this is this is a very
 
04:20:18.389 --> 04:20:18.399 align:start position:0%
narrow exception to the wide tapping
 
04:20:21.349 --> 04:20:21.359 align:start position:0%
statute and I think I think I think we
 
04:20:22.910 --> 04:20:22.920 align:start position:0%
deserve it and I think as law
 
04:20:25.389 --> 04:20:25.399 align:start position:0%
enforcement we we would benefit from it
 
04:20:27.750 --> 04:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
greatly uh I'm pretty unprepared but
 
04:20:31.229 --> 04:20:31.239 align:start position:0%
I'll take any questions if you've got
 
04:20:33.870 --> 04:20:33.880 align:start position:0%
them seeing none thank you thanks for
 
04:20:36.750 --> 04:20:36.760 align:start position:0%

again Mr chair and thank you once again
 
04:21:01.830 --> 04:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the committee my
 
04:21:03.590 --> 04:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
name is Ellen Reed for the record I
 
04:21:05.750 --> 04:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
represent Rockingham 10 which is New
 
04:21:08.750 --> 04:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
Market and new Fields this bill concerns
 
04:21:10.590 --> 04:21:10.600 align:start position:0%
loss of Consortium which is something we
 
04:21:12.710 --> 04:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
already have in our statute as the
 
04:21:15.070 --> 04:21:15.080 align:start position:0%
majority of states do have the history
 
04:21:17.349 --> 04:21:17.359 align:start position:0%
of loss of a Consortium is is honestly
 
04:21:21.710 --> 04:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
it's creepy it comes out of um hundreds
 
04:21:24.630 --> 04:21:24.640 align:start position:0%
of years ago in England when the idea
 
04:21:27.389 --> 04:21:27.399 align:start position:0%
was if you killed a woman's husband
 
04:21:29.750 --> 04:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
you're denying her monetary benefit but
 
04:21:32.830 --> 04:21:32.840 align:start position:0%
there was no if you killed a wife you
 
04:21:34.149 --> 04:21:34.159 align:start position:0%
weren't denying the man anything
 
04:21:36.710 --> 04:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
monetary but you were denying him
 
04:21:40.510 --> 04:21:40.520 align:start position:0%
Consortium his consort and so it got
 
04:21:42.790 --> 04:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
created many years ago hundreds of years
 
04:21:45.550 --> 04:21:45.560 align:start position:0%
ago as this like right of action
 
04:21:48.149 --> 04:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
essentially um for men who were losing
 
04:21:50.750 --> 04:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
their consort however it has been
 
04:21:54.510 --> 04:21:54.520 align:start position:0%
expanded in this country to um include
 
04:21:56.229 --> 04:21:56.239 align:start position:0%
certainly the loss of a spouse the
 
04:21:58.630 --> 04:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
emotional damage you experience when you
 
04:22:01.149 --> 04:22:01.159 align:start position:0%
lose a spouse um and that's pretty much
 
04:22:04.149 --> 04:22:04.159 align:start position:0%
Universal across the country uh Most
 
04:22:07.349 --> 04:22:07.359 align:start position:0%
states include a loss of a child we do
 
04:22:09.030 --> 04:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
not include the loss of a child in fact
 
04:22:10.950 --> 04:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
we don't really Define loss of
 
04:22:13.510 --> 04:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
Consortium at all in in our current loss
 
04:22:16.870 --> 04:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
of Consortium statute um this bill does
 
04:22:19.870 --> 04:22:19.880 align:start position:0%
Give a definition I'm happy if the uh
 
04:22:22.510 --> 04:22:22.520 align:start position:0%
committee wants to rework that
 
04:22:24.990 --> 04:22:25.000 align:start position:0%
definition but I think it's prudent at
 
04:22:27.070 --> 04:22:27.080 align:start position:0%
the very least to Define our current
 
04:22:28.309 --> 04:22:28.319 align:start position:0%
loss of
 
04:22:32.469 --> 04:22:32.479 align:start position:0%
Consortium um five states at last I knew
 
04:22:35.710 --> 04:22:35.720 align:start position:0%
as as of last year um extend loss of
 
04:22:38.830 --> 04:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
Consortium and some capacity some uh
 
04:22:41.870 --> 04:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
ability to um go after emotional damages
 
04:22:44.469 --> 04:22:44.479 align:start position:0%
for the loss of a
 
04:22:48.790 --> 04:22:48.800 align:start position:0%
pet I think the uh obvious argument is
 
04:22:51.830 --> 04:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
currently in our law and these states
 
04:22:53.389 --> 04:22:53.399 align:start position:0%
and I should read the states these
 
04:22:55.429 --> 04:22:55.439 align:start position:0%
states have decided that the current
 
04:22:57.109 --> 04:22:57.119 align:start position:0%
situation we have in New Hampshire is
 
04:22:59.149 --> 04:22:59.159 align:start position:0%
not sufficient because in our law right
 
04:23:02.189 --> 04:23:02.199 align:start position:0%
now if you have a dog or a cat and I
 
04:23:04.550 --> 04:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
kill your dog or cat either maliciously
 
04:23:07.030 --> 04:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
or negligently
 
04:23:09.469 --> 04:23:09.479 align:start position:0%
um the only thing you can go after me
 
04:23:11.189 --> 04:23:11.199 align:start position:0%
for is the replacement value of that
 
04:23:15.030 --> 04:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
animal a couple $100 or whatever um you
 
04:23:17.630 --> 04:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
cannot go after the actual damages that
 
04:23:21.309 --> 04:23:21.319 align:start position:0%
I have done to you which is denying you
 
04:23:24.750 --> 04:23:24.760 align:start position:0%
that particular animal your companion I
 
04:23:26.830 --> 04:23:26.840 align:start position:0%
think we all broadly know that our
 
04:23:28.990 --> 04:23:29.000 align:start position:0%
animals are worth more than their
 
04:23:31.030 --> 04:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
replacement value that they are our
 
04:23:32.910 --> 04:23:32.920 align:start position:0%
specific pets they are members of our
 
04:23:35.309 --> 04:23:35.319 align:start position:0%
family and we love them and it's a lot
 
04:23:37.990 --> 04:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
more damaging than just the cost of a
 
04:23:41.630 --> 04:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
new puppy um if someone were to brutally
 
04:23:44.710 --> 04:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
kill um our pet so these five states
 
04:23:46.950 --> 04:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
have seen that as an issue and have
 
04:23:48.469 --> 04:23:48.479 align:start position:0%
addressed it Illinois Maryland
 
04:23:50.950 --> 04:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
Connecticut Nevada and Tennessee there's
 
04:23:53.109 --> 04:23:53.119 align:start position:0%
my home state
 
04:23:56.750 --> 04:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
again home state leading the way so here
 
04:23:59.229 --> 04:23:59.239 align:start position:0%
I have uh included this is based on a a
 
04:24:01.950 --> 04:24:01.960 align:start position:0%
bill PRI uh prior sponsored by The
 
04:24:04.510 --> 04:24:04.520 align:start position:0%
Honorable Dan Hines who um introduced
 
04:24:07.510 --> 04:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
this last year um loss of consortial
 
04:24:09.070 --> 04:24:09.080 align:start position:0%
means the loss of Love companionship
 
04:24:10.990 --> 04:24:11.000 align:start position:0%
comfort care assistance protection
 
04:24:12.710 --> 04:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
affection society and moral support of a
 
04:24:14.950 --> 04:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
spouse or pet the loss of the enjoyment
 
04:24:16.269 --> 04:24:16.279 align:start position:0%
of sexual relation with a spouse or the
 
04:24:17.349 --> 04:24:17.359 align:start position:0%
loss of the ability to have children
 
04:24:18.750 --> 04:24:18.760 align:start position:0%
with a spouse so this would cover a wide
 
04:24:20.750 --> 04:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
range of damages including like if you
 
04:24:23.910 --> 04:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
were to maim or permanently disable a
 
04:24:26.229 --> 04:24:26.239 align:start position:0%
spouse um this is pretty consistent
 
04:24:28.870 --> 04:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
about uh with how it's used across the
 
04:24:31.750 --> 04:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
country um but that simply adds
 
04:24:34.590 --> 04:24:34.600 align:start position:0%
definition to paragraph two which is the
 
04:24:37.070 --> 04:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
current law that's existing
 
04:24:41.269 --> 04:24:41.279 align:start position:0%
law then paragraph three uh extends that
 
04:24:45.030 --> 04:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:47.469 --> 04:24:47.479 align:start position:0%
so one of the things I included in
 
04:24:50.429 --> 04:24:50.439 align:start position:0%
paragraph three is the specific covering
 
04:24:53.670 --> 04:24:53.680 align:start position:0%
of when an animal is killed by an
 
04:24:56.030 --> 04:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
officer and the reason I had to do that
 
04:24:57.710 --> 04:24:57.720 align:start position:0%
is because a number of years ago there
 
04:25:00.469 --> 04:25:00.479 align:start position:0%
was a court case in the state where a
 
04:25:02.269 --> 04:25:02.279 align:start position:0%
judge it did not go all the way to the
 
04:25:05.830 --> 04:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court but a judge um had found
 
04:25:08.109 --> 04:25:08.119 align:start position:0%
that the owners of a dog that had been
 
04:25:10.070 --> 04:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
killed by an off-duty officer NE
 
04:25:12.030 --> 04:25:12.040 align:start position:0%
negligently killed by an off-duty
 
04:25:15.229 --> 04:25:15.239 align:start position:0%
officer officer did not have a right to
 
04:25:18.030 --> 04:25:18.040 align:start position:0%
uh claim a negligent emotional damage
 
04:25:20.910 --> 04:25:20.920 align:start position:0%
against that officer and because of that
 
04:25:22.910 --> 04:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
and because there seems to be a lot of
 
04:25:25.109 --> 04:25:25.119 align:start position:0%
attention given to law enforcement
 
04:25:27.229 --> 04:25:27.239 align:start position:0%
officers who have killed people's pets
 
04:25:31.189 --> 04:25:31.199 align:start position:0%
either um certainly there is a a a
 
04:25:34.630 --> 04:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
reason to have to do that on occasion
 
04:25:35.870 --> 04:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
but there's been a lot of attention
 
04:25:37.750 --> 04:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
given to Law Enforcement Officers
 
04:25:39.750 --> 04:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
potentially needlessly killing people's
 
04:25:41.750 --> 04:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
pets and so because of that I have made
 
04:25:43.710 --> 04:25:43.720 align:start position:0%
sure to explicitly include Law
 
04:25:46.670 --> 04:25:46.680 align:start position:0%
Enforcement Officers um are not exempt
 
04:25:50.429 --> 04:25:50.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:54.710 --> 04:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
this so I I think the purpose the intent
 
04:25:58.269 --> 04:25:58.279 align:start position:0%
here is really obvious to kind of state
 
04:26:00.870 --> 04:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
that our pets are not simply property
 
04:26:04.349 --> 04:26:04.359 align:start position:0%
it's not like a vase a table a chair it
 
04:26:06.750 --> 04:26:06.760 align:start position:0%
it means much more to us than a pet
 
04:26:09.750 --> 04:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
means much more to us than um than
 
04:26:12.750 --> 04:26:12.760 align:start position:0%
simple property I realize that last year
 
04:26:14.710 --> 04:26:14.720 align:start position:0%
and likely this year the opposition
 
04:26:17.790 --> 04:26:17.800 align:start position:0%
against this bill um is mostly comprised
 
04:26:20.510 --> 04:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
of a couple different organizations the
 
04:26:22.910 --> 04:26:22.920 align:start position:0%
first would be breeders and breeding
 
04:26:25.550 --> 04:26:25.560 align:start position:0%
organizations um they have a direct
 
04:26:28.349 --> 04:26:28.359 align:start position:0%
financial interest in saying that
 
04:26:31.149 --> 04:26:31.159 align:start position:0%
animals are only property and not
 
04:26:33.309 --> 04:26:33.319 align:start position:0%
anything more than property it's very
 
04:26:34.269 --> 04:26:34.279 align:start position:0%
unfortunate and probably
 
04:26:35.870 --> 04:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
counterintuitive that they would want to
 
04:26:37.950 --> 04:26:37.960 align:start position:0%
argue that position but they definitely
 
04:26:40.229 --> 04:26:40.239 align:start position:0%
want to argue that position um and say
 
04:26:41.790 --> 04:26:41.800 align:start position:0%
that this is historically the case it's
 
04:26:43.070 --> 04:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
always been the case that animals are
 
04:26:45.870 --> 04:26:45.880 align:start position:0%
just property because they know that as
 
04:26:49.149 --> 04:26:49.159 align:start position:0%
we advance in Animal Welfare laws they
 
04:26:51.710 --> 04:26:51.720 align:start position:0%
are no longer allowed to necessarily do
 
04:26:53.550 --> 04:26:53.560 align:start position:0%
whatever they want to animals in the
 
04:26:55.750 --> 04:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
name of profit whereas if it's property
 
04:26:58.750 --> 04:26:58.760 align:start position:0%
they are so that is the kind of um
 
04:27:00.830 --> 04:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
position that that group has or has
 
04:27:03.389 --> 04:27:03.399 align:start position:0%
argued from you may very well hear that
 
04:27:05.830 --> 04:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
today the other group of opposition to
 
04:27:07.750 --> 04:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
this bill last year and I expect again
 
04:27:10.389 --> 04:27:10.399 align:start position:0%
this year um are insurance companies
 
04:27:14.349 --> 04:27:14.359 align:start position:0%
which of course um to lose a little bit
 
04:27:17.469 --> 04:27:17.479 align:start position:0%
if there is more damages in a in a civil
 
04:27:20.990 --> 04:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
action um if you have uh you're now not
 
04:27:23.910 --> 04:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
just on the hook for the $200 dog that
 
04:27:25.229 --> 04:27:25.239 align:start position:0%
you killed but you're on the hook for
 
04:27:27.429 --> 04:27:27.439 align:start position:0%
maybe $5,000 of emotional damage an
 
04:27:28.630 --> 04:27:28.640 align:start position:0%
insurance company doesn't want to have
 
04:27:32.229 --> 04:27:32.239 align:start position:0%
to cover that so that's also a monetary
 
04:27:36.389 --> 04:27:36.399 align:start position:0%
um motive to oppose this bill I will say
 
04:27:38.950 --> 04:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
we do this elsewhere where insurance
 
04:27:40.670 --> 04:27:40.680 align:start position:0%
companies will have to cover things for
 
04:27:43.309 --> 04:27:43.319 align:start position:0%
example malpractice we have malpractice
 
04:27:45.870 --> 04:27:45.880 align:start position:0%
laws we don't get rid of our malpractice
 
04:27:47.389 --> 04:27:47.399 align:start position:0%
just because insurance companies don't
 
04:27:50.670 --> 04:27:50.680 align:start position:0%
like having to pay so we are we do
 
04:27:53.630 --> 04:27:53.640 align:start position:0%
enshrine rights of action when people
 
04:27:55.910 --> 04:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
are being damaged in fact all of civil
 
04:27:58.429 --> 04:27:58.439 align:start position:0%
case civil action is the purpose of it
 
04:28:01.070 --> 04:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
is to make someone whole and if we as an
 
04:28:03.510 --> 04:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
entire Society acknowledge that our
 
04:28:05.590 --> 04:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
animal simply replacing a replacement
 
04:28:07.750 --> 04:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
value on an animal does not make the
 
04:28:10.030 --> 04:28:10.040 align:start position:0%
owner whole because you did lots of
 
04:28:12.349 --> 04:28:12.359 align:start position:0%
damage to that person by taking away way
 
04:28:14.469 --> 04:28:14.479 align:start position:0%
and brutally hurting their their animal
 
04:28:17.269 --> 04:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
then we are not doing the intent of
 
04:28:19.510 --> 04:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
civil action because we're not allowing
 
04:28:21.349 --> 04:28:21.359 align:start position:0%
people to be made
 
04:28:24.590 --> 04:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
whole um I would just end with saying
 
04:28:27.070 --> 04:28:27.080 align:start position:0%
the sky is not falling if we have this
 
04:28:29.710 --> 04:28:29.720 align:start position:0%
uh this right of action um that we
 
04:28:33.149 --> 04:28:33.159 align:start position:0%
extend to pets the previous Bill did
 
04:28:35.389 --> 04:28:35.399 align:start position:0%
extend it also to Children the
 
04:28:37.469 --> 04:28:37.479 align:start position:0%
conversation around that got very I
 
04:28:39.429 --> 04:28:39.439 align:start position:0%
think muddy and confusing and so I did
 
04:28:41.389 --> 04:28:41.399 align:start position:0%
not do that but it does make sense and I
 
04:28:44.030 --> 04:28:44.040 align:start position:0%
do support that concept of doing I think
 
04:28:45.830 --> 04:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
it's 33 other states extend it to
 
04:28:49.349 --> 04:28:49.359 align:start position:0%
children so having said that it's okay
 
04:28:51.670 --> 04:28:51.680 align:start position:0%
we can actually reflect our values in
 
04:28:53.269 --> 04:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
the law and allow people to be made
 
04:28:56.349 --> 04:28:56.359 align:start position:0%
whole when their pet is killed and I
 
04:28:58.229 --> 04:28:58.239 align:start position:0%
will be happy to take
 
04:29:00.830 --> 04:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
questions any questions representative
 
04:29:04.710 --> 04:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
McFarland thank you Mr chairman your
 
04:29:09.870 --> 04:29:09.880 align:start position:0%
bill uh defines loss of Consortium um
 
04:29:11.309 --> 04:29:11.319 align:start position:0%
and I think defines it in a different
 
04:29:13.670 --> 04:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
way than the courts historically have
 
04:29:17.229 --> 04:29:17.239 align:start position:0%
understood it as part of that definition
 
04:29:20.429 --> 04:29:20.439 align:start position:0%
it refers to a
 
04:29:24.030 --> 04:29:24.040 align:start position:0%
pet where is pet defined how how should
 
04:29:25.070 --> 04:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
it be
 
04:29:29.030 --> 04:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
defined thank you for the question um so
 
04:29:30.830 --> 04:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
you raise a good point anytime as you
 
04:29:34.389 --> 04:29:34.399 align:start position:0%
know uh a word is not defined in statute
 
04:29:37.030 --> 04:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
the courts go to the Miriam Webster
 
04:29:39.790 --> 04:29:39.800 align:start position:0%
Third Edition and I would suggest that
 
04:29:42.109 --> 04:29:42.119 align:start position:0%
that is the definition having said that
 
04:29:44.910 --> 04:29:44.920 align:start position:0%
that it really becomes an issue
 
04:29:48.550 --> 04:29:48.560 align:start position:0%
of did your pet tarantula give you the
 
04:29:50.870 --> 04:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
same emotional benefit that your you
 
04:29:53.630 --> 04:29:53.640 align:start position:0%
know 18-year-old golden retriever did or
 
04:29:55.830 --> 04:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
what have you and it becomes subjective
 
04:29:58.070 --> 04:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
and a lot of court cases end up being
 
04:30:00.750 --> 04:30:00.760 align:start position:0%
subjective last time this came through
 
04:30:02.710 --> 04:30:02.720 align:start position:0%
there was discussion on amending it to
 
04:30:05.510 --> 04:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
include minimums maximums perhaps no
 
04:30:08.469 --> 04:30:08.479 align:start position:0%
more than $10,000 perhaps no less than
 
04:30:10.830 --> 04:30:10.840 align:start position:0%
some amount um that would be a prudent
 
04:30:12.910 --> 04:30:12.920 align:start position:0%
way to go forward to make sure that
 
04:30:14.469 --> 04:30:14.479 align:start position:0%
people aren't like claiming their
 
04:30:16.469 --> 04:30:16.479 align:start position:0%
earthworm was you know a loss of
 
04:30:19.189 --> 04:30:19.199 align:start position:0%
emotional damage you could also go about
 
04:30:22.469 --> 04:30:22.479 align:start position:0%
trying to define the word pet or strike
 
04:30:25.030 --> 04:30:25.040 align:start position:0%
the word pet and replace something very
 
04:30:28.870 --> 04:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
specific dog cat horse whatever maybe I
 
04:30:30.590 --> 04:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
think you get kind of messy and I think
 
04:30:32.550 --> 04:30:32.560 align:start position:0%
it's kind of at that point as we
 
04:30:33.910 --> 04:30:33.920 align:start position:0%
typically do with our intentional
 
04:30:36.349 --> 04:30:36.359 align:start position:0%
ambiguity and law it's best left to the
 
04:30:38.550 --> 04:30:38.560 align:start position:0%
the judges at that point but if you have
 
04:30:40.790 --> 04:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
a good definition I'm happy to hear it I
 
04:30:43.670 --> 04:30:43.680 align:start position:0%
think the whole intent is to go forward
 
04:30:46.990 --> 04:30:47.000 align:start position:0%
with saying that animals are are Animal
 
04:30:48.630 --> 04:30:48.640 align:start position:0%
Companions are worth more than just
 
04:30:50.790 --> 04:30:50.800 align:start position:0%
replacement value this particular
 
04:30:52.870 --> 04:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
definition that I'm using here is based
 
04:30:57.149 --> 04:30:57.159 align:start position:0%
on last year's uh Bill follow up follow
 
04:31:00.670 --> 04:31:00.680 align:start position:0%
up so you've already indicated that you
 
04:31:02.750 --> 04:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
have an understanding of some of the
 
04:31:04.510 --> 04:31:04.520 align:start position:0%
opposition's points of view from the
 
04:31:07.149 --> 04:31:07.159 align:start position:0%
prior testimony we have in front of us
 
04:31:09.349 --> 04:31:09.359 align:start position:0%
written testimony from the American
 
04:31:11.269 --> 04:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
Kennel Club and from the dog owners of
 
04:31:13.269 --> 04:31:13.279 align:start position:0%
the Granite State and I imagine we'll be
 
04:31:14.950 --> 04:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
hearing from at least one of those
 
04:31:17.790 --> 04:31:17.800 align:start position:0%
organizations presently I imagine in
 
04:31:19.950 --> 04:31:19.960 align:start position:0%
your understanding you you you started
 
04:31:22.670 --> 04:31:22.680 align:start position:0%
talking about this and I didn't quite
 
04:31:25.670 --> 04:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
follow what do you what do you perceive
 
04:31:28.710 --> 04:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
to be their motivation is it the fact
 
04:31:31.429 --> 04:31:31.439 align:start position:0%
that um the language here doesn't speak
 
04:31:32.870 --> 04:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
to ownership of the pet or is it
 
04:31:37.750 --> 04:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
something else oh no I based on um not
 
04:31:40.030 --> 04:31:40.040 align:start position:0%
just testimony from last year's this
 
04:31:41.630 --> 04:31:41.640 align:start position:0%
version of this that last year's version
 
04:31:44.269 --> 04:31:44.279 align:start position:0%
of bill but based on the testimony and
 
04:31:46.630 --> 04:31:46.640 align:start position:0%
various bills from those organizations
 
04:31:48.349 --> 04:31:48.359 align:start position:0%
my understanding of their opposition to
 
04:31:51.030 --> 04:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
the concept in general is that they very
 
04:31:53.630 --> 04:31:53.640 align:start position:0%
much are invested in the idea that an
 
04:31:56.189 --> 04:31:56.199 align:start position:0%
animal is only ever property like a
 
04:31:59.149 --> 04:31:59.159 align:start position:0%
table a chair a car that it has no value
 
04:32:04.030 --> 04:32:04.040 align:start position:0%
beyond that because that enables them to
 
04:32:08.830 --> 04:32:08.840 align:start position:0%
um make money without a lot of answering
 
04:32:11.109 --> 04:32:11.119 align:start position:0%
to what they are afraid of would be
 
04:32:14.149 --> 04:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
future and welfare legislation and an
 
04:32:16.790 --> 04:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
example of that is I think we're going
 
04:32:18.389 --> 04:32:18.399 align:start position:0%
to hear from them what their motivation
 
04:32:19.469 --> 04:32:19.479 align:start position:0%
sure I'm just answering the
 
04:32:21.269 --> 04:32:21.279 align:start position:0%
representative's question he was asking
 
04:32:24.269 --> 04:32:24.279 align:start position:0%
my you some leeway so but interpreting
 
04:32:25.670 --> 04:32:25.680 align:start position:0%
their motivation as opposed to us
 
04:32:27.950 --> 04:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
hearing from them directly is I think
 
04:32:29.189 --> 04:32:29.199 align:start position:0%
that's probably a better I appreciate
 
04:32:30.670 --> 04:32:30.680 align:start position:0%
the point Mr chair is answering the
 
04:32:33.870 --> 04:32:33.880 align:start position:0%
representative's question any other
 
04:32:38.630 --> 04:32:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:50.149 --> 04:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:52.429 --> 04:32:52.439 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you Mr chairman
 
04:32:54.070 --> 04:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the Judiciary
 
04:32:56.870 --> 04:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
Committee my name is Stacy Ober I am the
 
04:32:59.349 --> 04:32:59.359 align:start position:0%
New England government relations manager
 
04:33:02.149 --> 04:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
for the American Kennel Club and you may
 
04:33:04.830 --> 04:33:04.840 align:start position:0%
or may not know that we are a 140
 
04:33:07.949 --> 04:33:07.959 align:start position:0%
yearold Animal Welfare organization a
 
04:33:10.789 --> 04:33:10.799 align:start position:0%
nonprofit Club of clubs uh we're a
 
04:33:13.830 --> 04:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
recognized expert in K9 Health breeding
 
04:33:16.230 --> 04:33:16.240 align:start position:0%
training and responsible dog ownership
 
04:33:18.230 --> 04:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
we have more than 5,000 clubs across the
 
04:33:21.470 --> 04:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
country including 13 here in New
 
04:33:24.269 --> 04:33:24.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh that represents hundreds of
 
04:33:25.949 --> 04:33:25.959 align:start position:0%
dog owners who are passionate about
 
04:33:30.029 --> 04:33:30.039 align:start position:0%
their dogs um I wanted to acknowledge
 
04:33:33.109 --> 04:33:33.119 align:start position:0%
that house 593 would expand the
 
04:33:35.750 --> 04:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
relationship eligible for potential loss
 
04:33:37.551 --> 04:33:37.561 align:start position:0%
of Consortium damages to include
 
04:33:39.429 --> 04:33:39.439 align:start position:0%
individuals relationships with their
 
04:33:42.470 --> 04:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
pets and as you heard from the bill
 
04:33:45.230 --> 04:33:45.240 align:start position:0%
sponsor this concept was included in
 
04:33:48.629 --> 04:33:48.639 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1684 last year and rejected
 
04:33:51.189 --> 04:33:51.199 align:start position:0%
by um this
 
04:33:54.830 --> 04:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
committee um we know that people do
 
04:33:58.029 --> 04:33:58.039 align:start position:0%
experience real grief upon the loss of a
 
04:34:02.230 --> 04:34:02.240 align:start position:0%
pet and AKC established five years ago
 
04:34:04.670 --> 04:34:04.680 align:start position:0%
an online pet loss group that has more
 
04:34:07.949 --> 04:34:07.959 align:start position:0%
than 13,000 individual members um
 
04:34:10.029 --> 04:34:10.039 align:start position:0%
there's little doubt that dogs are held
 
04:34:13.029 --> 04:34:13.039 align:start position:0%
in exceedingly High esteem throughout
 
04:34:16.109 --> 04:34:16.119 align:start position:0%
modern American society um but the
 
04:34:18.390 --> 04:34:18.400 align:start position:0%
American Kennel CL Club is an animal
 
04:34:20.629 --> 04:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
welfare organization not an animal
 
04:34:22.670 --> 04:34:22.680 align:start position:0%
rights organization so I wanted to take
 
04:34:24.750 --> 04:34:24.760 align:start position:0%
a moment and just make the distinction
 
04:34:25.990 --> 04:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
between the
 
04:34:29.750 --> 04:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
two there are many organizations that
 
04:34:32.429 --> 04:34:32.439 align:start position:0%
philosophically their position is to
 
04:34:35.670 --> 04:34:35.680 align:start position:0%
oppose the use of animals by humans and
 
04:34:38.070 --> 04:34:38.080 align:start position:0%
advocate for changes in law that would
 
04:34:40.470 --> 04:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
imply animals have the same legal status
 
04:34:43.029 --> 04:34:43.039 align:start position:0%
as humans and an example of that would
 
04:34:46.150 --> 04:34:46.160 align:start position:0%
be not allowing working dogs whether
 
04:34:49.670 --> 04:34:49.680 align:start position:0%
that be police canine livestock her uh
 
04:34:53.709 --> 04:34:53.719 align:start position:0%
Guardian dogs therapy dogs that unless a
 
04:34:56.230 --> 04:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
dog provides its consent it should not
 
04:34:58.830 --> 04:34:58.840 align:start position:0%
be used in a work as a in a working
 
04:35:00.390 --> 04:35:00.400 align:start position:0%
function for
 
04:35:03.349 --> 04:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
instance Animal Welfare organizations
 
04:35:05.429 --> 04:35:05.439 align:start position:0%
focus on improving the quality of life
 
04:35:07.629 --> 04:35:07.639 align:start position:0%
for Animals we support the use of
 
04:35:10.189 --> 04:35:10.199 align:start position:0%
animals such as working dogs uh police
 
04:35:12.310 --> 04:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
canines our clubs have contri Ed Under
 
04:35:16.070 --> 04:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
the adopt a k9 cop uh to police dogs to
 
04:35:18.429 --> 04:35:18.439 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire towns for instance we
 
04:35:21.150 --> 04:35:21.160 align:start position:0%
seek to minimize suffering and disease
 
04:35:23.551 --> 04:35:23.561 align:start position:0%
our K9 Health Foundation has funded more
 
04:35:26.910 --> 04:35:26.920 align:start position:0%
than $68 million in K-9 Health uh
 
04:35:29.830 --> 04:35:29.840 align:start position:0%
research that has benefited all dogs and
 
04:35:31.990 --> 04:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
promoting responsible care proper
 
04:35:35.109 --> 04:35:35.119 align:start position:0%
housing nutrition for animals and we
 
04:35:38.070 --> 04:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
have in place a longstanding legal legal
 
04:35:41.310 --> 04:35:41.320 align:start position:0%
framework that actually supports those
 
04:35:41.320 --> 04:35:42.189 align:start position:0%
framework that actually supports those
goals

04:35:42.189 --> 04:35:42.199 align:start position:0%
goals
 
04:35:44.310 --> 04:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
which is why we're concerned about this
 
04:35:48.070 --> 04:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
particular bill it the legal framework
 
04:35:50.429 --> 04:35:50.439 align:start position:0%
holds owners accountable for providing
 
04:35:52.189 --> 04:35:52.199 align:start position:0%
proper housing and nutrition that's why
 
04:35:55.150 --> 04:35:55.160 align:start position:0%
we it's how our animal cruelty laws are
 
04:36:00.150 --> 04:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
able to be enforced um and we also use
 
04:36:01.510 --> 04:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
the legal
 
04:36:05.629 --> 04:36:05.639 align:start position:0%
term pets as personal property because
 
04:36:08.349 --> 04:36:08.359 align:start position:0%
if animals are stolen for instance the
 
04:36:11.551 --> 04:36:11.561 align:start position:0%
legal system allows for the return of
 
04:36:13.150 --> 04:36:13.160 align:start position:0%
stolen property so those are some
 
04:36:15.029 --> 04:36:15.039 align:start position:0%
examples as to how the legal framework
 
04:36:18.510 --> 04:36:18.520 align:start position:0%
has worked um I've submitted written
 
04:36:20.869 --> 04:36:20.879 align:start position:0%
testimony and uh just wanted to
 
04:36:24.269 --> 04:36:24.279 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that our concerns in adding
 
04:36:26.789 --> 04:36:26.799 align:start position:0%
non-economic damages for the loss of a
 
04:36:30.949 --> 04:36:30.959 align:start position:0%
pet could result in an implied change of
 
04:36:34.830 --> 04:36:34.840 align:start position:0%
the legal status of of animals that
 
04:36:39.070 --> 04:36:39.080 align:start position:0%
would in the longterm really create um
 
04:36:42.429 --> 04:36:42.439 align:start position:0%
unintended but very negative consequen
 
04:36:44.390 --> 04:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
uh for that and I can elaborate and give
 
04:36:47.390 --> 04:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
examples if that's helpful to the
 
04:36:49.990 --> 04:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
committee okay any questions
 
04:36:50.000 --> 04:36:52.150 align:start position:0%
committee okay any questions

McFarland
 
04:36:56.310 --> 04:36:56.320 align:start position:0%
so I I've read through your written
 
04:36:57.869 --> 04:36:57.879 align:start position:0%
testimony as well as heard what you said
 
04:36:59.789 --> 04:36:59.799 align:start position:0%
and I I very much appreciate that I I
 
04:37:02.750 --> 04:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
guess in trying to understand a bit more
 
04:37:05.070 --> 04:37:05.080 align:start position:0%
about the the negative consequences that
 
04:37:08.709 --> 04:37:08.719 align:start position:0%
you foresee I certainly uh I look at
 
04:37:10.470 --> 04:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
this language of this bill and I see a
 
04:37:14.429 --> 04:37:14.439 align:start position:0%
number of areas of concern but can you
 
04:37:17.310 --> 04:37:17.320 align:start position:0%
help me understand for example if I
 
04:37:20.109 --> 04:37:20.119 align:start position:0%
think to a squirrel in New York called
 
04:37:22.869 --> 04:37:22.879 align:start position:0%
Peanut who was recently murdered uh by
 
04:37:25.551 --> 04:37:25.561 align:start position:0%
law enforcement do you believe that
 
04:37:29.750 --> 04:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
there is um justification for there to
 
04:37:33.830 --> 04:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
be uh a a better cause of action in our
 
04:37:36.029 --> 04:37:36.039 align:start position:0%
statutes against that kind of an event
 
04:37:37.990 --> 04:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
and a better course of action for for
 
04:37:40.750 --> 04:37:40.760 align:start position:0%
the the pets owner uh to to you know
 
04:37:43.390 --> 04:37:43.400 align:start position:0%
recover damage
 
04:37:47.910 --> 04:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
I think the law it purposely should
 
04:37:50.750 --> 04:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
acknowledge when there is emotional
 
04:37:54.150 --> 04:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
distress and there are tort avenues for
 
04:37:57.029 --> 04:37:57.039 align:start position:0%
the infliction of emotional distress for
 
04:38:00.189 --> 04:38:00.199 align:start position:0%
instance um but in terms of loss of
 
04:38:02.470 --> 04:38:02.480 align:start position:0%
Consortium this particular bill is
 
04:38:04.510 --> 04:38:04.520 align:start position:0%
equating a pet with the same
 
04:38:07.629 --> 04:38:07.639 align:start position:0%
relationship as a spouse uh the sponsor
 
04:38:09.590 --> 04:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
noted for instance that New Hampshire
 
04:38:12.789 --> 04:38:12.799 align:start position:0%
law does not allow loss of Consortium
 
04:38:16.189 --> 04:38:16.199 align:start position:0%
even for let's say a child who loses a
 
04:38:19.109 --> 04:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
parent and so from our vantage point the
 
04:38:21.429 --> 04:38:21.439 align:start position:0%
ultimate goal of these incremental
 
04:38:26.310 --> 04:38:26.320 align:start position:0%
changes is to uh create statutory
 
04:38:29.109 --> 04:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
language that would suggest that pets
 
04:38:32.750 --> 04:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
are of the same legal status as humans
 
04:38:36.670 --> 04:38:36.680 align:start position:0%
and uh our concern about that is for
 
04:38:39.949 --> 04:38:39.959 align:start position:0%
instance um let's say you have a
 
04:38:42.990 --> 04:38:43.000 align:start position:0%
veterinarian that PR perform surgery on
 
04:38:45.150 --> 04:38:45.160 align:start position:0%
on your pet and there's an unfortunate
 
04:38:47.590 --> 04:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
outcome because just like medical care
 
04:38:49.590 --> 04:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
nothing is uh
 
04:38:52.789 --> 04:38:52.799 align:start position:0%
absolute in that instance the court were
 
04:38:55.789 --> 04:38:55.799 align:start position:0%
this to pass would have to come up with
 
04:38:58.510 --> 04:38:58.520 align:start position:0%
a subjective determination as to the
 
04:39:01.709 --> 04:39:01.719 align:start position:0%
level of emotional grief that the owner
 
04:39:05.910 --> 04:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
or family suffered um our concern is
 
04:39:10.349 --> 04:39:10.359 align:start position:0%
that veterinary medicine would resort to
 
04:39:13.949 --> 04:39:13.959 align:start position:0%
defensive practices in terms of having
 
04:39:18.590 --> 04:39:18.600 align:start position:0%
to perform every test or every procedure
 
04:39:21.429 --> 04:39:21.439 align:start position:0%
for fear of being sued in the event they
 
04:39:25.189 --> 04:39:25.199 align:start position:0%
misdiagnosed or there's some other uh un
 
04:39:28.830 --> 04:39:28.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunate outcome for a pet and that
 
04:39:32.910 --> 04:39:32.920 align:start position:0%
those kinds of lawsuits are an incentive
 
04:39:36.230 --> 04:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
for attorneys to bring cases forward
 
04:39:38.590 --> 04:39:38.600 align:start position:0%
that in the long run it could increase
 
04:39:41.788 --> 04:39:41.798 align:start position:0%
the cost of Veterinary Care um making it
 
04:39:43.670 --> 04:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
more difficult for people to access
 
04:39:45.390 --> 04:39:45.400 align:start position:0%
Veterinary Care from an affordable
 
04:39:47.628 --> 04:39:47.638 align:start position:0%
standpoint and it's another example of
 
04:39:50.910 --> 04:39:50.920 align:start position:0%
the long-term negative consequence We
 
04:39:54.910 --> 04:39:54.920 align:start position:0%
Believe including non-economic damages
 
04:39:57.470 --> 04:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
in the loss of a pet would result in I
 
04:39:59.390 --> 04:39:59.400 align:start position:0%
hope I hope that's
 
04:40:01.350 --> 04:40:01.360 align:start position:0%
helpful any other
 
04:40:07.990 --> 04:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:17.628 --> 04:40:17.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:18.590 --> 04:40:18.600 align:start position:0%
was there someone else that wanted to
 
04:40:20.708 --> 04:40:20.718 align:start position:0%
speak on this oh you have your pink card
 
04:40:23.910 --> 04:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
with you and somebody else turned one in
 
04:40:26.070 --> 04:40:26.080 align:start position:0%
already yes you can come on up and just
 
04:40:28.310 --> 04:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
state your name okay I got to locate it
 
04:40:35.310 --> 04:40:35.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:49.830 --> 04:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:53.190 --> 04:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:07.030 --> 04:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:09.990 --> 04:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
here you'll note that the testimony I'm
 
04:41:12.750 --> 04:41:12.760 align:start position:0%
handing in has both sides I printed on
 
04:41:15.390 --> 04:41:15.400 align:start position:0%
both sides and just try to save a little
 
04:41:18.628 --> 04:41:18.638 align:start position:0%
bit of uh paper
 
04:41:21.470 --> 04:41:21.480 align:start position:0%
um okay Mr chairman and members of the
 
04:41:24.230 --> 04:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee my name's Nancy
 
04:41:26.948 --> 04:41:26.958 align:start position:0%
Holmes I'm from New Boston New Hampshire
 
04:41:30.830 --> 04:41:30.840 align:start position:0%
I'm opposing the changes proposed in HB
 
04:41:33.670 --> 04:41:33.680 align:start position:0%
593 just for a little background yes I
 
04:41:35.590 --> 04:41:35.600 align:start position:0%
have been a breeder yes I have been an
 
04:41:38.390 --> 04:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
Animal Rescuer I've studied animals all
 
04:41:41.948 --> 04:41:41.958 align:start position:0%
my life and I spent some time five or
 
04:41:43.910 --> 04:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
six years online is the top animal
 
04:41:45.350 --> 04:41:45.360 align:start position:0%
expert on a
 
04:41:48.830 --> 04:41:48.840 align:start position:0%
website um I got looking at this law and
 
04:41:50.788 --> 04:41:50.798 align:start position:0%
I like to look at the original Law just
 
04:41:52.670 --> 04:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
to see what I if I can figure out what
 
04:41:57.390 --> 04:41:57.400 align:start position:0%
its intent was if you look at 5078 law
 
04:42:00.868 --> 04:42:00.878 align:start position:0%
of Consortium you will see that it only
 
04:42:03.948 --> 04:42:03.958 align:start position:0%
applies to a h husband or wife and no
 
04:42:05.550 --> 04:42:05.560 align:start position:0%
other family
 
04:42:08.390 --> 04:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
member um I believe this is because loss
 
04:42:11.230 --> 04:42:11.240 align:start position:0%
of Consortium between husbands and wives
 
04:42:14.708 --> 04:42:14.718 align:start position:0%
lives includes sexual relations and all
 
04:42:17.150 --> 04:42:17.160 align:start position:0%
common interpretations of the term uh
 
04:42:18.190 --> 04:42:18.200 align:start position:0%
loss of
 
04:42:20.830 --> 04:42:20.840 align:start position:0%
Consortium if you look at the I included
 
04:42:23.110 --> 04:42:23.120 align:start position:0%
a little blip from Corno law school for
 
04:42:25.708 --> 04:42:25.718 align:start position:0%
an explanation of the loss of Consortium
 
04:42:28.510 --> 04:42:28.520 align:start position:0%
laws and how they were developed to to
 
04:42:32.910 --> 04:42:32.920 align:start position:0%
be like this HB 593 includes changes
 
04:42:34.830 --> 04:42:34.840 align:start position:0%
that equate the loss of a pet to the
 
04:42:37.590 --> 04:42:37.600 align:start position:0%
loss of a spouse a comparison that
 
04:42:40.350 --> 04:42:40.360 align:start position:0%
appears to me to be negated by a laws
 
04:42:40.360 --> 04:42:41.628 align:start position:0%
appears to me to be negated by a laws
onal

04:42:41.628 --> 04:42:41.638 align:start position:0%
onal
 
04:42:43.110 --> 04:42:43.120 align:start position:0%
and believe me I spent some very
 
04:42:45.270 --> 04:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable hours up here when they
 
04:42:49.070 --> 04:42:49.080 align:start position:0%
were working on the beastiality laws um
 
04:42:51.390 --> 04:42:51.400 align:start position:0%
and despite the spo's attempt to remove
 
04:42:53.868 --> 04:42:53.878 align:start position:0%
a link to sex in their new definition of
 
04:42:56.510 --> 04:42:56.520 align:start position:0%
Consortium I don't think that's going to
 
04:43:00.390 --> 04:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
hold however our law covers claims of
 
04:43:03.070 --> 04:43:03.080 align:start position:0%
children and other close relations for
 
04:43:06.030 --> 04:43:06.040 align:start position:0%
wrongful death damages they're addressed
 
04:43:08.390 --> 04:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
under RSA
 
04:43:13.230 --> 04:43:13.240 align:start position:0%
55612 um because RSA 5 78a does not
 
04:43:16.830 --> 04:43:16.840 align:start position:0%
apply to them um I included the law so
 
04:43:18.230 --> 04:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
you can just see it I hate having to
 
04:43:22.190 --> 04:43:22.200 align:start position:0%
look stuff up so I just threw it in um
 
04:43:26.310 --> 04:43:26.320 align:start position:0%
and you get down to 3D it says for the
 
04:43:28.270 --> 04:43:28.280 align:start position:0%
purpose of this paragraph loss of
 
04:43:30.470 --> 04:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
familial relationship shall include the
 
04:43:32.948 --> 04:43:32.958 align:start position:0%
loss of comfort Society affection
 
04:43:35.948 --> 04:43:35.958 align:start position:0%
guidance and companionship of the
 
04:43:39.868 --> 04:43:39.878 align:start position:0%
deceased and then it gives in a a mass
 
04:43:42.350 --> 04:43:42.360 align:start position:0%
uh uh amount of award that is possible
 
04:43:44.628 --> 04:43:44.638 align:start position:0%
the highest amount that's possible as
 
04:43:46.350 --> 04:43:46.360 align:start position:0%
you can see children would be eligible
 
04:43:48.030 --> 04:43:48.040 align:start position:0%
to have claims made for them under our
 
04:43:49.990 --> 04:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
wrongful death laws and I believe
 
04:43:53.910 --> 04:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
parents are covered there too um in the
 
04:43:59.070 --> 04:43:59.080 align:start position:0%
uh um under 55612 but not under
 
04:44:01.150 --> 04:44:01.160 align:start position:0%
50770 some might believe that the
 
04:44:03.788 --> 04:44:03.798 align:start position:0%
wrongful death statute more closely
 
04:44:06.270 --> 04:44:06.280 align:start position:0%
equated to the loss of a pet except that
 
04:44:08.788 --> 04:44:08.798 align:start position:0%
under our laws animals are property and
 
04:44:11.510 --> 04:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
are not humans or persons
 
04:44:13.550 --> 04:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
thus I do not believe even the wrongful
 
04:44:15.670 --> 04:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
death statutes apply to the loss of an
 
04:44:17.708 --> 04:44:17.718 align:start position:0%
animal no matter how beloved that animal
 
04:44:19.550 --> 04:44:19.560 align:start position:0%
is and believe me I'm somebody who
 
04:44:22.590 --> 04:44:22.600 align:start position:0%
really loves their animals um
 
04:44:25.788 --> 04:44:25.798 align:start position:0%
and I I I've been an animal person my
 
04:44:29.510 --> 04:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
entire life um so while I understand the
 
04:44:32.590 --> 04:44:32.600 align:start position:0%
emotional intent of this bill I believe
 
04:44:33.670 --> 04:44:33.680 align:start position:0%
the bill is
 
04:44:35.550 --> 04:44:35.560 align:start position:0%
wrong-minded and I think it should be
 
04:44:38.590 --> 04:44:38.600 align:start position:0%
voted as itl as incompatible with our
 
04:44:41.430 --> 04:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
current statutes protecting spouse and
 
04:44:44.190 --> 04:44:44.200 align:start position:0%
children and also with the common legal
 
04:44:45.910 --> 04:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
definitions of loss of
 
04:44:50.190 --> 04:44:50.200 align:start position:0%
Consortium um I believe as um I believe
 
04:44:53.110 --> 04:44:53.120 align:start position:0%
it was Stacy said that our current laws
 
04:44:55.030 --> 04:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
all are oriented to the fact that
 
04:44:57.670 --> 04:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
animals are property and we have all
 
04:44:59.868 --> 04:44:59.878 align:start position:0%
kinds of laws to U make sure they are
 
04:45:03.910 --> 04:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
cared for properly and that uh and so on
 
04:45:06.990 --> 04:45:07.000 align:start position:0%
um it just it doesn't make sense to me
 
04:45:09.270 --> 04:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
to suddenly change them into people in
 
04:45:11.788 --> 04:45:11.798 align:start position:0%
this bill because that would ruined
 
04:45:13.948 --> 04:45:13.958 align:start position:0%
everything else we have done um for
 
04:45:17.270 --> 04:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
Animal Welfare uh causes in this state
 
04:45:19.150 --> 04:45:19.160 align:start position:0%
so be happy to take any questions I'll
 
04:45:20.310 --> 04:45:20.320 align:start position:0%
see if I can
 
04:45:22.510 --> 04:45:22.520 align:start position:0%
answer any
 
04:45:25.190 --> 04:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you okay

04:45:45.708 --> 04:45:45.718 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chairman members of the
 
04:45:48.430 --> 04:45:48.440 align:start position:0%
committee uh my name is Angela Ferrari
 
04:45:50.390 --> 04:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
and I am president of dog owners of the
 
04:45:52.868 --> 04:45:52.878 align:start position:0%
Granite State we are a nonprofit
 
04:45:55.910 --> 04:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
organization that was founded in 1991 to
 
04:45:57.270 --> 04:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
represent the interests of all pet
 
04:45:59.350 --> 04:45:59.360 align:start position:0%
owners in New Hampshire uh we have a
 
04:46:02.150 --> 04:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
Vibrant Community from kennel clubs dog
 
04:46:05.310 --> 04:46:05.320 align:start position:0%
owners breeders and fanciers across the
 
04:46:08.270 --> 04:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
board um I would like to focus my
 
04:46:10.510 --> 04:46:10.520 align:start position:0%
testimony I did submit written testimony
 
04:46:12.750 --> 04:46:12.760 align:start position:0%
but I'm going to inter a bit from it and
 
04:46:15.270 --> 04:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
focus more on the ownership rights that
 
04:46:17.670 --> 04:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
were mentioned um during the opening
 
04:46:22.470 --> 04:46:22.480 align:start position:0%
introduction of today's bill so we feel
 
04:46:24.350 --> 04:46:24.360 align:start position:0%
that it's crucial to prevent pets from
 
04:46:26.670 --> 04:46:26.680 align:start position:0%
being included in loss of Consortium
 
04:46:28.390 --> 04:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
laws because doing so would
 
04:46:31.070 --> 04:46:31.080 align:start position:0%
fundamentally alter their legal status
 
04:46:32.910 --> 04:46:32.920 align:start position:0%
setting a dangerous precedent that could
 
04:46:35.030 --> 04:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
strip away owner rights and create
 
04:46:37.628 --> 04:46:37.638 align:start position:0%
unintended legal consequences some
 
04:46:40.868 --> 04:46:40.878 align:start position:0%
examples changing Pets As property

04:46:45.470 --> 04:46:45.480 align:start position:0%
law pets are personal property similar
 
04:46:47.868 --> 04:46:47.878 align:start position:0%
to a car or a home and owners have full
 
04:46:50.270 --> 04:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
rights uh over their animals including
 
04:46:52.628 --> 04:46:52.638 align:start position:0%
decisions about their care training and
 
04:46:55.150 --> 04:46:55.160 align:start position:0%
even euthanasia when necessary by
 
04:46:57.230 --> 04:46:57.240 align:start position:0%
granting loss of Consortium claims for
 
04:46:59.350 --> 04:46:59.360 align:start position:0%
pets they are no longer treated as
 
04:47:01.350 --> 04:47:01.360 align:start position:0%
property but instead as something closer
 
04:47:03.750 --> 04:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
to a legal person potentially limiting
 
04:47:05.430 --> 04:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
what owners can do with their own
 
04:47:07.590 --> 04:47:07.600 align:start position:0%
animals this shift could open the door
 
04:47:09.830 --> 04:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
to government overreach where lawmakers
 
04:47:11.990 --> 04:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
or courts could dictate how to care for
 
04:47:15.390 --> 04:47:15.400 align:start position:0%
sell or even breed your own animals loss
 
04:47:18.110 --> 04:47:18.120 align:start position:0%
of Consortium expands legal standing so
 
04:47:20.788 --> 04:47:20.798 align:start position:0%
we want to ask the question who can sue
 
04:47:22.788 --> 04:47:22.798 align:start position:0%
if pets are granted loss of Consortium
 
04:47:25.310 --> 04:47:25.320 align:start position:0%
protections who has the right to sue
 
04:47:27.708 --> 04:47:27.718 align:start position:0%
could a shelter a previous owner or even
 
04:47:29.868 --> 04:47:29.878 align:start position:0%
an activist group claim a legal interest
 
04:47:32.190 --> 04:47:32.200 align:start position:0%
in your pet's well-being this could lead
 
04:47:34.110 --> 04:47:34.120 align:start position:0%
to Legal battles over custody
 
04:47:35.990 --> 04:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
decision-making rights and even
 
04:47:38.510 --> 04:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
restrictions to pet ownership similar to
 
04:47:40.990 --> 04:47:41.000 align:start position:0%
child custody cases
 
04:47:43.110 --> 04:47:43.120 align:start position:0%
uh it also creates a pathway for pet
 
04:47:45.948 --> 04:47:45.958 align:start position:0%
guardianship over ownership so animal
 
04:47:48.030 --> 04:47:48.040 align:start position:0%
rights activists have long pushed for
 
04:47:51.628 --> 04:47:51.638 align:start position:0%
replacing pet owner with pet Guardian in
 
04:47:54.350 --> 04:47:54.360 align:start position:0%
legal definitions in loss of Consortium
 
04:47:56.470 --> 04:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
applies to pets it moves us closer to a
 
04:47:58.910 --> 04:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
system where pets have legal standing
 
04:48:01.510 --> 04:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
meaning courts not owners could have a
 
04:48:03.628 --> 04:48:03.638 align:start position:0%
say in their care this could eventually
 
04:48:06.030 --> 04:48:06.040 align:start position:0%
mean you would no longer own your pet
 
04:48:08.590 --> 04:48:08.600 align:start position:0%
but instead manage them under state or
 
04:48:11.430 --> 04:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
federal regulations reducing your rights
 
04:48:13.270 --> 04:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
we feel it opens the door to frivolous
 
04:48:15.788 --> 04:48:15.798 align:start position:0%
lawsuits allowing emotional damages for
 
04:48:17.788 --> 04:48:17.798 align:start position:0%
pets could flood the legal system with
 
04:48:20.868 --> 04:48:20.878 align:start position:0%
expensive subjective claims if someone
 
04:48:22.510 --> 04:48:22.520 align:start position:0%
accidentally harms a pet whether a
 
04:48:24.788 --> 04:48:24.798 align:start position:0%
veterinarian or a groomer as mentioned
 
04:48:28.070 --> 04:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
in Miss ober's uh testimony from the AKC
 
04:48:30.030 --> 04:48:30.040 align:start position:0%
they could face massive lawsuits for
 
04:48:32.470 --> 04:48:32.480 align:start position:0%
emotional distress businesses
 
04:48:34.750 --> 04:48:34.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities and individuals would
 
04:48:36.548 --> 04:48:36.558 align:start position:0%
face enormous liability risks
 
04:48:38.350 --> 04:48:38.360 align:start position:0%
potentially leading to higher costs for
 
04:48:41.868 --> 04:48:41.878 align:start position:0%
veterinary care and even home insurance
 
04:48:44.990 --> 04:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
um also want to mention the slippery
 
04:48:47.470 --> 04:48:47.480 align:start position:0%
slope and what comes next from this type
 
04:48:50.030 --> 04:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
of law if pets get legal rights to loss
 
04:48:52.670 --> 04:48:52.680 align:start position:0%
of Consortium what could follow could
 
04:48:56.190 --> 04:48:56.200 align:start position:0%
service animals farm animals or E even
 
04:48:59.708 --> 04:48:59.718 align:start position:0%
AI companionship devices or heirlooms
 
04:49:02.390 --> 04:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
from your family members gain similar
 
04:49:05.110 --> 04:49:05.120 align:start position:0%
legal recognition would animal activists
 
04:49:06.868 --> 04:49:06.878 align:start position:0%
then push for restrictions on pet
 
04:49:08.990 --> 04:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
breeding training or even ownership
 
04:49:11.310 --> 04:49:11.320 align:start position:0%
itself this sets aess ident that could
 
04:49:13.628 --> 04:49:13.638 align:start position:0%
erode human rights over property and
 
04:49:16.190 --> 04:49:16.200 align:start position:0%
blur the line between pets and legal
 
04:49:18.548 --> 04:49:18.558 align:start position:0%
persons uh protecting owner's rights
 
04:49:21.470 --> 04:49:21.480 align:start position:0%
means keeping Pets As property so we
 
04:49:26.030 --> 04:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
would ask that you would uh itl HB 539
 
04:49:29.030 --> 04:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
and I would answer any questions any
 
04:49:32.628 --> 04:49:32.638 align:start position:0%

04:49:42.110 --> 04:49:42.120 align:start position:0%
yep hi um my my name is Shauna silver
 
04:49:44.390 --> 04:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
and I requested this pill at the wrong
 
04:49:45.948 --> 04:49:45.958 align:start position:0%

on filing a vet board complaint as
 
04:49:54.110 --> 04:49:54.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned before there are five states
 
04:49:55.830 --> 04:49:55.840 align:start position:0%
that have adopted modest laws that
 
04:49:57.830 --> 04:49:57.840 align:start position:0%

people like myself this is just
 
04:50:25.628 --> 04:50:25.638 align:start position:0%
Amplified because sometimes this is like
 
04:50:27.708 --> 04:50:27.718 align:start position:0%

a child and that the loss can be equal
 
04:50:40.310 --> 04:50:40.320 align:start position:0%
to the loss of a human family member
 
04:50:42.190 --> 04:50:42.200 align:start position:0%
compar comparing a living being with the

04:50:47.750 --> 04:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
outdated as millions of people consider
 
04:50:49.830 --> 04:50:49.840 align:start position:0%
them family Consortium does not give
 
04:50:51.868 --> 04:50:51.878 align:start position:0%
legal rights to animals but asks the
 
04:50:53.430 --> 04:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
state and the law to recognize the
 
04:50:55.910 --> 04:50:55.920 align:start position:0%

the health benefits that the animal gave
 
04:51:00.150 --> 04:51:00.160 align:start position:0%

owner mentally emotionally and
 
04:51:15.150 --> 04:51:15.160 align:start position:0%
physically I'll use myself as an example
 
04:51:16.830 --> 04:51:16.840 align:start position:0%
I have ongoing panic attacks and I've

guarantee that the judge would still
 
04:51:24.708 --> 04:51:24.718 align:start position:0%

option to ask for it on Tennessee law
 
04:51:31.390 --> 04:51:31.400 align:start position:0%
review.org animal Consortium it goes
 
04:51:34.270 --> 04:51:34.280 align:start position:0%
into detail on how uh Consortium has
 
04:51:36.430 --> 04:51:36.440 align:start position:0%
expanded when it first started and women
 
04:51:39.590 --> 04:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
were also legally viewed as property but
 
04:51:42.030 --> 04:51:42.040 align:start position:0%
now allowed Consortium and it expanded
 
04:51:44.070 --> 04:51:44.080 align:start position:0%
again allowing other family members and
 
04:51:45.628 --> 04:51:45.638 align:start position:0%
now pets to be covered under the
 
04:51:48.948 --> 04:51:48.958 align:start position:0%
Consortium umbrella uh the document also
 
04:51:51.190 --> 04:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
goes into detail on a scientific study
 
04:51:53.350 --> 04:51:53.360 align:start position:0%
called bulb's attachment Theory proving
 
04:51:56.310 --> 04:51:56.320 align:start position:0%
that the human to animal bond is just as
 
04:51:58.510 --> 04:51:58.520 align:start position:0%
significant as a human to human Bond and
 
04:52:00.910 --> 04:52:00.920 align:start position:0%
it gives many examples of this it also
 
04:52:03.310 --> 04:52:03.320 align:start position:0%
goes into in-depth detail of all the
 
04:52:05.788 --> 04:52:05.798 align:start position:0%
positive health benefits of the human
 
04:52:08.788 --> 04:52:08.798 align:start position:0%
Companion Animal Bond um laws change all
 
04:52:10.750 --> 04:52:10.760 align:start position:0%
the time people weren't able to list
 
04:52:13.788 --> 04:52:13.798 align:start position:0%
their pets as a beneficiary on their
 
04:52:16.310 --> 04:52:16.320 align:start position:0%

04:52:19.830 --> 04:52:19.840 align:start position:0%
can and as of 2016 32 states now allow
 
04:52:21.628 --> 04:52:21.638 align:start position:0%
animals to be included in protective
 
04:52:24.990 --> 04:52:25.000 align:start position:0%
orders New Hampshire is also starting to
 
04:52:27.750 --> 04:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
recognize pets as living beings versus
 
04:52:29.788 --> 04:52:29.798 align:start position:0%
property like in family law they rule
 
04:52:31.788 --> 04:52:31.798 align:start position:0%
for the best interest of the pet and
 
04:52:33.910 --> 04:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
during states of emergency you can now
 
04:52:36.390 --> 04:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
bring your pet to emergency emergency
 
04:52:38.430 --> 04:52:38.440 align:start position:0%
shelters uh I hope the state of New
 
04:52:39.910 --> 04:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire will join these states and
 
04:52:41.990 --> 04:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
show compass for the owners whose pets
 
04:52:44.230 --> 04:52:44.240 align:start position:0%
were wrongfully killed as they were also
 
04:52:46.708 --> 04:52:46.718 align:start position:0%
the victim of trauma and mental anguish
 
04:52:48.190 --> 04:52:48.200 align:start position:0%
especially in cases involving
 
04:52:50.070 --> 04:52:50.080 align:start position:0%
professionals who fail to uphold the
 
04:52:52.110 --> 04:52:52.120 align:start position:0%
standard duty of care like in Daisy's
 
04:52:54.310 --> 04:52:54.320 align:start position:0%
case I hope that New Hampshire can come
 
04:52:56.750 --> 04:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
to a fair compromise on this bill like
 
04:52:59.030 --> 04:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
how other states allow non-economic
 
04:53:02.150 --> 04:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
damages Andor consorta but also have a
 
04:53:04.110 --> 04:53:04.120 align:start position:0%
maximum limit on what you can claim and
 
04:53:06.390 --> 04:53:06.400 align:start position:0%
other restrictions um so people can't
 
04:53:10.070 --> 04:53:10.080 align:start position:0%
abuse it and um I do know that the AKC
 
04:53:12.708 --> 04:53:12.718 align:start position:0%
you know opposed it um because of they
 
04:53:14.030 --> 04:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
were worried about the safety and
 
04:53:15.990 --> 04:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
insurance going up but I think that this
 
04:53:18.070 --> 04:53:18.080 align:start position:0%
bill would actually limit incidents and
 
04:53:20.868 --> 04:53:20.878 align:start position:0%
wrongful deaths because um with a higher
 
04:53:22.708 --> 04:53:22.718 align:start position:0%
consequence hanging above the
 
04:53:24.430 --> 04:53:24.440 align:start position:0%
professionals heads they would pay more
 
04:53:27.628 --> 04:53:27.638 align:start position:0%
attention and less incidents would occur
 
04:53:29.470 --> 04:53:29.480 align:start position:0%
like with driving if you're a safer
 
04:53:30.708 --> 04:53:30.718 align:start position:0%
driver you're going to have lower
 
04:53:33.350 --> 04:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
insurance and you know animal hospitals
 
04:53:35.910 --> 04:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
already have liability insurance so that
 
04:53:38.310 --> 04:53:38.320 align:start position:0%
would most likely cover this and
 
04:53:39.868 --> 04:53:39.878 align:start position:0%
especially if you put a limit on how
 
04:53:42.150 --> 04:53:42.160 align:start position:0%
much people people could ask for and
 
04:53:44.590 --> 04:53:44.600 align:start position:0%
upselling exploratory testing before
 
04:53:46.670 --> 04:53:46.680 align:start position:0%
diagnostic testing is being seen more
 
04:53:49.030 --> 04:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
and more according to the medical expert
 
04:53:50.628 --> 04:53:50.638 align:start position:0%
witness that I spoke with regarding
 
04:53:53.110 --> 04:53:53.120 align:start position:0%
Daisy's situation and this along with a
 
04:53:55.548 --> 04:53:55.558 align:start position:0%
vet tech going against vet's orders uh
 
04:53:57.548 --> 04:53:57.558 align:start position:0%
and withholding her medicine later to
 
04:54:00.868 --> 04:54:00.878 align:start position:0%
call it in and still never do it um
 
04:54:02.230 --> 04:54:02.240 align:start position:0%
incidents like this are currently
 
04:54:04.708 --> 04:54:04.718 align:start position:0%
hurting animals medical issues that
 
04:54:06.708 --> 04:54:06.718 align:start position:0%
could easily be identified and treated
 
04:54:08.910 --> 04:54:08.920 align:start position:0%
are being overlooked this is hurting
 
04:54:11.350 --> 04:54:11.360 align:start position:0%
animals um I would like New Hampshire to
 
04:54:13.430 --> 04:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
please look into the states that do
 
04:54:15.430 --> 04:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
allow this and see that
 
04:54:18.590 --> 04:54:18.600 align:start position:0%
liability and um is not going up and
 
04:54:20.510 --> 04:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
animals are not getting hurt because of
 
04:54:23.150 --> 04:54:23.160 align:start position:0%
this uh because of the restrictions and
 
04:54:25.270 --> 04:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
because it would be up to the judge's
 
04:54:27.628 --> 04:54:27.638 align:start position:0%
discretion and
 
04:54:31.750 --> 04:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
um yeah I'm not really so sure about why
 
04:54:33.708 --> 04:54:33.718 align:start position:0%
the AKC thinks that this would be
 
04:54:35.868 --> 04:54:35.878 align:start position:0%
harmful when according to the Humane
 
04:54:38.310 --> 04:54:38.320 align:start position:0%
Society they actually opposed A lot of
 
04:54:40.628 --> 04:54:40.638 align:start position:0%
bills that were targeted at Protec
 
04:54:42.590 --> 04:54:42.600 align:start position:0%
animals like stopping puppy mills and
 
04:54:45.230 --> 04:54:45.240 align:start position:0%
animal fighting and again this law would
 
04:54:48.230 --> 04:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
be aimed at the human and the loss of
 
04:54:51.670 --> 04:54:51.680 align:start position:0%
that relationship thank you um is there
 
04:54:54.548 --> 04:54:54.558 align:start position:0%
any questions any questions at all
 
04:54:55.868 --> 04:54:55.878 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you and do you have
 
04:54:57.150 --> 04:54:57.160 align:start position:0%
some written testimony that you want to
 
04:55:00.310 --> 04:55:00.320 align:start position:0%
turn in or um yeah okay if you even if
 
04:55:02.548 --> 04:55:02.558 align:start position:0%
it's one we can give to the clerk okay
 
04:55:05.390 --> 04:55:05.400 align:start position:0%
if you want to thank you yeah I don't
 
04:55:06.788 --> 04:55:06.798 align:start position:0%
have any more pink cards for this bill
 
04:55:08.030 --> 04:55:08.040 align:start position:0%
is there any else that wants to speak on
 
04:55:12.070 --> 04:55:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:13.430 --> 04:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
okay I'm going to close the hearing on
 
04:55:15.270 --> 04:55:15.280 align:start position:0%
House Bill

05:02:48.548 --> 05:02:48.558 align:start position:0%
okay good afternoon thank you CH Mr
 
05:02:52.270 --> 05:02:52.280 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you to this committee um
 
05:02:53.990 --> 05:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
this is very exciting this is my first
 
05:02:57.150 --> 05:02:57.160 align:start position:0%
bill so I'm really thrilled to be
 
05:03:03.230 --> 05:03:03.240 align:start position:0%
here um so HB 462 is a bill that I filed
 
05:03:05.510 --> 05:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
after learning about um a situation in
 
05:03:08.070 --> 05:03:08.080 align:start position:0%
my town I represent Mar County 8 which
 
05:03:10.628 --> 05:03:10.638 align:start position:0%
is um the towns of hen
 
05:03:14.788 --> 05:03:14.798 align:start position:0%
Bradford and Warner so um someone in a
 
05:03:17.670 --> 05:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
neighborhood had um talked to hen is a
 
05:03:20.430 --> 05:03:20.440 align:start position:0%
small town everyone knows everybody and
 
05:03:23.190 --> 05:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
um someone had complained about their
 
05:03:26.030 --> 05:03:26.040 align:start position:0%
neighbor putting a camera directly on
 
05:03:28.670 --> 05:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
their property line and and watching
 
05:03:32.628 --> 05:03:32.638 align:start position:0%
their um their backyard and they have a
 
05:03:34.470 --> 05:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
a daughter who's the same age as a
 
05:03:36.750 --> 05:03:36.760 align:start position:0%
Teenage late teenage daughter and they
 
05:03:38.510 --> 05:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
have a pool it was just really
 
05:03:40.708 --> 05:03:40.718 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable and
 
05:03:43.390 --> 05:03:43.400 align:start position:0%
um I I reached out to them because I was
 
05:03:45.990 --> 05:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
going to learn more and as I did I asked
 
05:03:48.708 --> 05:03:48.718 align:start position:0%
them if they went to um the police in
 
05:03:51.070 --> 05:03:51.080 align:start position:0%
our town and they said they did and that
 
05:03:52.310 --> 05:03:52.320 align:start position:0%
the police said there was nothing they
 
05:03:54.750 --> 05:03:54.760 align:start position:0%
could do about it and um I went to the
 
05:03:56.350 --> 05:03:56.360 align:start position:0%
home and I wanted to see it for myself
 
05:04:00.548 --> 05:04:00.558 align:start position:0%
and see how it was put in um and that's
 
05:04:03.150 --> 05:04:03.160 align:start position:0%
why I have this diagram for you so I'm
 
05:04:04.510 --> 05:04:04.520 align:start position:0%
just giving you the backstory of how
 
05:04:07.670 --> 05:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
this came to be so the camera is very
 
05:04:10.070 --> 05:04:10.080 align:start position:0%
far away from the second house it's on a
 
05:04:12.350 --> 05:04:12.360 align:start position:0%
post a wooden post right on the property
 
05:04:15.150 --> 05:04:15.160 align:start position:0%
line looking right into the backyard so
 
05:04:18.030 --> 05:04:18.040 align:start position:0%
I was surprised that the police couldn't
 
05:04:19.868 --> 05:04:19.878 align:start position:0%
do anything about it and I met with our
 
05:04:21.948 --> 05:04:21.958 align:start position:0%
police chief his name is Chief Matt
 
05:04:24.150 --> 05:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
French and he concurred that there was
 
05:04:25.948 --> 05:04:25.958 align:start position:0%
nothing that they could do it wasn't
 
05:04:27.510 --> 05:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
violating any laws because it was on
 
05:04:29.830 --> 05:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
their own property so I did some
 
05:04:32.350 --> 05:04:32.360 align:start position:0%
research and found some similar laws
 
05:04:35.190 --> 05:04:35.200 align:start position:0%
that have a cause of action um option
 
05:04:37.110 --> 05:04:37.120 align:start position:0%
from other states New York state was
 
05:04:39.910 --> 05:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
another one a close one and I went back
 
05:04:41.750 --> 05:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
and talked to our chief and he thought
 
05:04:44.190 --> 05:04:44.200 align:start position:0%
it was a great idea to submit this bill
 
05:04:47.110 --> 05:04:47.120 align:start position:0%
so um if you look at the online support
 
05:04:50.390 --> 05:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
of this bill um Chief Matt French did
 
05:04:52.868 --> 05:04:52.878 align:start position:0%
support it and also our Senator Dan Enis
 
05:04:54.470 --> 05:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
gave support and I did talk to him about
 
05:04:56.470 --> 05:04:56.480 align:start position:0%
it so I was grateful for him to sign on
 
05:04:57.430 --> 05:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
as a
 
05:05:00.868 --> 05:05:00.878 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor um so yeah this will help
 
05:05:03.868 --> 05:05:03.878 align:start position:0%
give folks an option whereas now they
 
05:05:06.070 --> 05:05:06.080 align:start position:0%
have no option to deal with some sort of
 
05:05:08.470 --> 05:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
perceived violation of someone videoing
 
05:05:09.990 --> 05:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
them directly in their backyard it's
 
05:05:14.070 --> 05:05:14.080 align:start position:0%
specifically backyard is in the language
 
05:05:17.150 --> 05:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
so and that's all I have to say and if
 
05:05:17.160 --> 05:05:18.030 align:start position:0%
so and that's all I have to say and if
any

05:05:18.030 --> 05:05:18.040 align:start position:0%
any
 
05:05:20.310 --> 05:05:20.320 align:start position:0%
questions any questions
 
05:05:23.070 --> 05:05:23.080 align:start position:0%
repur thanks and thanks for the question
 
05:05:24.830 --> 05:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
I was it was specifically the inclusion
 
05:05:27.750 --> 05:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
of backyard that I was was wondering
 
05:05:31.548 --> 05:05:31.558 align:start position:0%
about um and and I guess good segue from
 
05:05:34.868 --> 05:05:34.878 align:start position:0%
our last conversation but you know we we
 
05:05:36.750 --> 05:05:36.760 align:start position:0%
now have cell phone cameras that can you
 
05:05:40.670 --> 05:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
know zoom in 20x you know
 
05:05:43.590 --> 05:05:43.600 align:start position:0%
uh wouldn't it would it be sort of any
 
05:05:46.470 --> 05:05:46.480 align:start position:0%
recording of your home by somebody I
 
05:05:47.948 --> 05:05:47.958 align:start position:0%
mean you could zoom in on someone's
 
05:05:50.110 --> 05:05:50.120 align:start position:0%
window and watch everything that's going
 
05:05:51.990 --> 05:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
on if you have access to the front of
 
05:05:54.230 --> 05:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
the house I guess is my question so that
 
05:05:55.868 --> 05:05:55.878 align:start position:0%
that actually zooming into someone's
 
05:05:59.470 --> 05:05:59.480 align:start position:0%
window is actually covered under 644 RSA
 
05:06:03.150 --> 05:06:03.160 align:start position:0%
644 um so and then it it's specific to
 
05:06:05.990 --> 05:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
the backyard because people do perceive
 
05:06:08.230 --> 05:06:08.240 align:start position:0%
their backyard to be their space to have
 
05:06:10.350 --> 05:06:10.360 align:start position:0%
Recreation and hang out in their pool do
 
05:06:12.350 --> 05:06:12.360 align:start position:0%
the different things everyone has ring
 
05:06:14.190 --> 05:06:14.200 align:start position:0%
cameras nowadays so that sort of takes
 
05:06:16.110 --> 05:06:16.120 align:start position:0%
care of the front you can't really um
 
05:06:19.628 --> 05:06:19.638 align:start position:0%
try to regulate that um but the backyard
 
05:06:21.830 --> 05:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
and this you know I gave my diagram just
 
05:06:25.190 --> 05:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
to show how this is a pretty rural area
 
05:06:27.708 --> 05:06:27.718 align:start position:0%
so there's no other houses around so
 
05:06:29.150 --> 05:06:29.160 align:start position:0%
there's really no need for someone to
 
05:06:31.150 --> 05:06:31.160 align:start position:0%
put a camera directly facing into
 
05:06:35.150 --> 05:06:35.160 align:start position:0%
someone's yard um if other other than to
 
05:06:36.350 --> 05:06:36.360 align:start position:0%
harass them or make them feel
 
05:06:38.190 --> 05:06:38.200 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable so they they did try to
 
05:06:39.830 --> 05:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
talk to these neighbors themselves
 
05:06:42.430 --> 05:06:42.440 align:start position:0%
directly and the neighbors said too bad
 
05:06:43.628 --> 05:06:43.638 align:start position:0%
we're not breaking the law we can do
 
05:06:49.310 --> 05:06:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:51.868 --> 05:06:51.878 align:start position:0%
so representative
 
05:06:53.830 --> 05:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
rbo thank you and thank you for taking
 
05:06:56.430 --> 05:06:56.440 align:start position:0%
my question um I noticed the language
 
05:06:58.990 --> 05:06:59.000 align:start position:0%
that refers to installing or fixing a
 
05:07:01.030 --> 05:07:01.040 align:start position:0%
video Imaging device
 
05:07:03.948 --> 05:07:03.958 align:start position:0%
um I imagine that was distinct from
 
05:07:05.788 --> 05:07:05.798 align:start position:0%
someone standing at that property line
 
05:07:07.788 --> 05:07:07.798 align:start position:0%
filming can you tell us a little more
 
05:07:09.110 --> 05:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
about that that difference or why
 
05:07:11.548 --> 05:07:11.558 align:start position:0%
choosing need to phrase it this way um I
 
05:07:13.750 --> 05:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
just actually used that language from
 
05:07:15.470 --> 05:07:15.480 align:start position:0%
other bills that I had come across from
 
05:07:16.670 --> 05:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
other states and it I didn't know if
 
05:07:18.708 --> 05:07:18.718 align:start position:0%
there was a re like was specific reason
 
05:07:19.948 --> 05:07:19.958 align:start position:0%
for no because I don't think you're
 
05:07:21.788 --> 05:07:21.798 align:start position:0%
going to have someone standing outside
 
05:07:23.150 --> 05:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
for extented periods of time just
 
05:07:25.310 --> 05:07:25.320 align:start position:0%
videoing in someone's home and someone's
 
05:07:27.868 --> 05:07:27.878 align:start position:0%
backyard putting a post there and so
 
05:07:29.628 --> 05:07:29.638 align:start position:0%
that's always going and you can view
 
05:07:31.150 --> 05:07:31.160 align:start position:0%
from your home from the comfort of your
 
05:07:33.470 --> 05:07:33.480 align:start position:0%
laptop back home is I think more
 
05:07:35.430 --> 05:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
invasive I'm glad you haven't lost your
 
05:07:38.070 --> 05:07:38.080 align:start position:0%
faith yet but okay all right I'm just
 
05:07:39.070 --> 05:07:39.080 align:start position:0%
curious if there was a reason for that
 
05:07:40.990 --> 05:07:41.000 align:start position:0%
language thank you okay representative
 
05:07:44.110 --> 05:07:44.120 align:start position:0%
McFarland thank you Mr chairman can you
 
05:07:48.030 --> 05:07:48.040 align:start position:0%
explain why if you believe in this bill
 
05:07:51.510 --> 05:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
you also think it's appropriate for us
 
05:07:54.470 --> 05:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
to still permit law enforcement to use
 
05:07:56.230 --> 05:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
these mechanisms to threaten the person
 
05:07:58.670 --> 05:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
or property of another person or harass
 
05:08:01.628 --> 05:08:01.638 align:start position:0%
annoy and alarm another person I don't
 
05:08:03.910 --> 05:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily concur that if law
 
05:08:05.390 --> 05:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement are involved in some sort of
 
05:08:07.430 --> 05:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
surveillance that that is to purposely
 
05:08:10.390 --> 05:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
harass them or annoy them or cause harm
 
05:08:11.510 --> 05:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
to them
 
05:08:14.270 --> 05:08:14.280 align:start position:0%
so I think police do need to have the
 
05:08:16.548 --> 05:08:16.558 align:start position:0%
ability to do that under C circumstances
 
05:08:19.868 --> 05:08:19.878 align:start position:0%
if they perceive um illegal activity and
 
05:08:22.590 --> 05:08:22.600 align:start position:0%
whatnot going on so this is really for
 
05:08:25.788 --> 05:08:25.798 align:start position:0%
civil civil things follow up quickly
 
05:08:28.230 --> 05:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
unless you're going to so if that's the
 
05:08:30.708 --> 05:08:30.718 align:start position:0%
case then can you explain how in the
 
05:08:33.590 --> 05:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
case of non-law enforcement you would
 
05:08:37.470 --> 05:08:37.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:39.590 --> 05:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
is well it wouldn't be up to me to to
 
05:08:41.788 --> 05:08:41.798 align:start position:0%
assess it would be up to the courts to
 
05:08:44.590 --> 05:08:44.600 align:start position:0%
assess if someone feels that someone is
 
05:08:46.590 --> 05:08:46.600 align:start position:0%
watching them via camera as in this
 
05:08:48.788 --> 05:08:48.798 align:start position:0%
scenario um and then they talked to
 
05:08:49.948 --> 05:08:49.958 align:start position:0%
their neighbor and their neighbor said
 
05:08:52.670 --> 05:08:52.680 align:start position:0%
too bad then now current state they
 
05:08:55.390 --> 05:08:55.400 align:start position:0%
don't have any recourse in the new state
 
05:08:56.670 --> 05:08:56.680 align:start position:0%
they would have the ability to bring
 
05:08:59.510 --> 05:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
their case forward to a judge in a civil
 
05:09:01.868 --> 05:09:01.878 align:start position:0%
claim and let the judge decide if they
 
05:09:04.868 --> 05:09:04.878 align:start position:0%
were being harassed representative
 
05:09:08.910 --> 05:09:08.920 align:start position:0%
Smith oh thank you Mr my question was uh
 
05:09:10.190 --> 05:09:10.200 align:start position:0%
the same as
 
05:09:12.830 --> 05:09:12.840 align:start position:0%
representative mcfar and the question
 
05:09:16.510 --> 05:09:16.520 align:start position:0%
of of being able to assess motive on the
 
05:09:20.030 --> 05:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
part of somebody of somebody else
 
05:09:24.070 --> 05:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
um could it not be a bird watcher who
 
05:09:27.190 --> 05:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
wants to have a camera in an open area
 
05:09:28.670 --> 05:09:28.680 align:start position:0%
where there's also
 
05:09:33.350 --> 05:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
water just to see what birds I suppose
 
05:09:35.150 --> 05:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
but they could have put their camera at
 
05:09:36.708 --> 05:09:36.718 align:start position:0%
an angle along the property line if they
 
05:09:38.430 --> 05:09:38.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to watch wildlife and Birds
 
05:09:40.270 --> 05:09:40.280 align:start position:0%
versus pointing directly into the
 
05:09:43.310 --> 05:09:43.320 align:start position:0%
backyard at the pool thank you
 
05:09:45.910 --> 05:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
yeah representative
 
05:09:48.310 --> 05:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
trip thank you Mr chair uh thank you for
 
05:09:52.190 --> 05:09:52.200 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh I got more than
 
05:09:54.190 --> 05:09:54.200 align:start position:0%
one but uh let's start with the first
 
05:09:59.830 --> 05:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
one uh the uh the camera I presume that
 
05:10:03.670 --> 05:10:03.680 align:start position:0%
it's mounted on the house number two's
 
05:10:06.070 --> 05:10:06.080 align:start position:0%
property no it's in the diagram it's
 
05:10:10.310 --> 05:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
mounted on a post down by the what yeah
 
05:10:14.110 --> 05:10:14.120 align:start position:0%
but the the house number two's property
 
05:10:17.990 --> 05:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
extends to behind the house number one
 
05:10:21.830 --> 05:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
correct so it's mounted on the uh house
 
05:10:23.590 --> 05:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
number two's property it's on their
 
05:10:24.708 --> 05:10:24.718 align:start position:0%
property I thought you meant it on their
 
05:10:26.868 --> 05:10:26.878 align:start position:0%
home no it's on their property correct
 
05:10:28.628 --> 05:10:28.638 align:start position:0%
on a post on their
 
05:10:34.548 --> 05:10:34.558 align:start position:0%
property follow up corly y uh so the the
 
05:10:37.868 --> 05:10:37.878 align:start position:0%
the issue at hand is that uh the uh the
 
05:10:40.510 --> 05:10:40.520 align:start position:0%
camera is used to video the rear of the
 
05:10:42.190 --> 05:10:42.200 align:start position:0%
house number
 
05:10:45.510 --> 05:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
one correct that's what's happening
 
05:10:47.390 --> 05:10:47.400 align:start position:0%
yes one
 
05:10:50.110 --> 05:10:50.120 align:start position:0%
more one more go ahead okay so I think
 
05:10:51.788 --> 05:10:51.798 align:start position:0%
you're getting somewhere here what I
 
05:10:54.390 --> 05:10:54.400 align:start position:0%
think you're getting somewhere so so the
 
05:10:57.548 --> 05:10:57.558 align:start position:0%
uh has house number one given any
 
05:11:00.150 --> 05:11:00.160 align:start position:0%
thought to mounting a flood light
 
05:11:04.150 --> 05:11:04.160 align:start position:0%
pointed at the uh the video camera so
 
05:11:06.670 --> 05:11:06.680 align:start position:0%
this is a very this is not exactly to
 
05:11:08.510 --> 05:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
scale but this is a rural area these are
 
05:11:10.030 --> 05:11:10.040 align:start position:0%
very large
 
05:11:13.868 --> 05:11:13.878 align:start position:0%
guards so for them to inst expend money
 
05:11:16.310 --> 05:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
to put in either we talked about a fence
 
05:11:18.190 --> 05:11:18.200 align:start position:0%
I said why don't if you put up a fence
 
05:11:20.590 --> 05:11:20.600 align:start position:0%
or a another post with a light that's
 
05:11:22.430 --> 05:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
still expense they have to run electric
 
05:11:24.390 --> 05:11:24.400 align:start position:0%
through a long distance to get it out
 
05:11:27.510 --> 05:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
there it's not a practical thing to try
 
05:11:30.350 --> 05:11:30.360 align:start position:0%
to block that camera that way yeah
 
05:11:30.360 --> 05:11:32.030 align:start position:0%
to block that camera that way yeah
representative

05:11:32.030 --> 05:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:11:35.390 --> 05:11:35.400 align:start position:0%
Morton would would this thank you um
 
05:11:37.350 --> 05:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
would this have anything to do with
 
05:11:37.360 --> 05:11:39.948 align:start position:0%
would this have anything to do with
drones

05:11:39.948 --> 05:11:39.958 align:start position:0%
drones
 
05:11:42.670 --> 05:11:42.680 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if it would apply to
 
05:11:45.910 --> 05:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
drones it's um I suppose if
 
05:11:49.990 --> 05:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
the video video Imaging
 
05:11:53.230 --> 05:11:53.240 align:start position:0%
device installs are fixes so yeah it's
 
05:11:55.590 --> 05:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
different yeah I don't think Rees the
 
05:11:55.600 --> 05:11:57.390 align:start position:0%
different yeah I don't think Rees the
drones

05:11:57.390 --> 05:11:57.400 align:start position:0%
drones
 
05:12:00.670 --> 05:12:00.680 align:start position:0%
yeah representative MOS thank you Mr
 
05:12:02.350 --> 05:12:02.360 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
05:12:04.788 --> 05:12:04.798 align:start position:0%
question do you happen to know as you
 
05:12:07.350 --> 05:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
learned about this situation was the
 
05:12:10.350 --> 05:12:10.360 align:start position:0%
post that the camera is is mounted on
 
05:12:13.270 --> 05:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
was the post put there on purpose to
 
05:12:16.310 --> 05:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
mount the camera to correct it hadn't
 
05:12:19.350 --> 05:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
been there um so this place this land
 
05:12:22.150 --> 05:12:22.160 align:start position:0%
where House 2 is was vacant it it was a
 
05:12:24.150 --> 05:12:24.160 align:start position:0%
lot for sale for a long time and no
 
05:12:26.390 --> 05:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
houses were there and it was purchased a
 
05:12:27.470 --> 05:12:27.480 align:start position:0%
house was
 
05:12:30.830 --> 05:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
built then the post was put up with the
 
05:12:33.708 --> 05:12:33.718 align:start position:0%
camera so they were done simultaneously
 
05:12:36.030 --> 05:12:36.040 align:start position:0%
the the post was installed for the
 
05:12:37.868 --> 05:12:37.878 align:start position:0%
purpose of holding the camera mounting
 
05:12:41.190 --> 05:12:41.200 align:start position:0%
the camera yes yes thank you any other
 
05:12:44.750 --> 05:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
questions represent T yeah sorry another
 
05:12:46.750 --> 05:12:46.760 align:start position:0%
another specifics of language but thanks
 
05:12:48.548 --> 05:12:48.558 align:start position:0%
for your earlier answer on the on the
 
05:12:51.270 --> 05:12:51.280 align:start position:0%
term backyard um I noticed it says
 
05:12:54.430 --> 05:12:54.440 align:start position:0%
images of the recreational activities um
 
05:12:57.430 --> 05:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
and it also specifies a joining property
 
05:12:59.750 --> 05:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
both of those seem like they kind of
 
05:13:04.190 --> 05:13:04.200 align:start position:0%
provide workarounds for this um in terms
 
05:13:06.708 --> 05:13:06.718 align:start position:0%
of what the activity actually is and
 
05:13:08.350 --> 05:13:08.360 align:start position:0%
what if you're what if it's not a
 
05:13:10.070 --> 05:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
joining what if there's a what if you're
 
05:13:13.390 --> 05:13:13.400 align:start position:0%
going across you know the another piece
 
05:13:15.310 --> 05:13:15.320 align:start position:0%
of property before you before you're
 
05:13:18.150 --> 05:13:18.160 align:start position:0%
doing the same exact thing you know like
 
05:13:20.230 --> 05:13:20.240 align:start position:0%
a zoom camera two two properties away
 
05:13:22.110 --> 05:13:22.120 align:start position:0%
but you've got a clear line of sight so
 
05:13:23.910 --> 05:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
those two questions just in terms of why
 
05:13:26.990 --> 05:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
those two terms are in in the bill a
 
05:13:29.230 --> 05:13:29.240 align:start position:0%
recreational and a joining I think we'd
 
05:13:31.070 --> 05:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
have to ask OS because they helped with
 
05:13:31.080 --> 05:13:31.640 align:start position:0%
have to ask OS because they helped with
the

05:13:31.640 --> 05:13:31.650 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:13:31.650 --> 05:13:35.230 align:start position:0%
the
[Laughter]

05:13:35.230 --> 05:13:35.240 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
05:13:38.190 --> 05:13:38.200 align:start position:0%
language is there is there follow up I'm
 
05:13:40.788 --> 05:13:40.798 align:start position:0%
sorry is is there a reason why you would
 
05:13:43.788 --> 05:13:43.798 align:start position:0%
think those words are needed in this
 
05:13:46.390 --> 05:13:46.400 align:start position:0%
vill I'm not sure I'm not an attorney so
 
05:13:48.750 --> 05:13:48.760 align:start position:0%
I don't know I I they recommended it
 
05:13:50.910 --> 05:13:50.920 align:start position:0%
they put it in so
 
05:13:54.270 --> 05:13:54.280 align:start position:0%
yeah representative McFarland was this
 
05:13:56.628 --> 05:13:56.638 align:start position:0%
the only video camera on the property of
 
05:14:00.230 --> 05:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:02.470 --> 05:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
yes any other
 
05:14:05.110 --> 05:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you
 
05:14:06.390 --> 05:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
congratulations for getting through your
 
05:14:10.070 --> 05:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
first one thank you
 
05:14:10.080 --> 05:14:14.948 align:start position:0%
first one thank you
representative

05:14:14.948 --> 05:14:14.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:17.190 --> 05:14:17.200 align:start position:0%
Reed thank you once again and for the
 
05:14:20.390 --> 05:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
final time today Mr chair and honorable
 
05:14:21.948 --> 05:14:21.958 align:start position:0%
members again my name is Ellen Reed and
 
05:14:23.868 --> 05:14:23.878 align:start position:0%
I still represent rocking Hampton New
 
05:14:26.590 --> 05:14:26.600 align:start position:0%
Market and newfields um I just generally
 
05:14:28.070 --> 05:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
want to affirm my support as a
 
05:14:32.270 --> 05:14:32.280 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of this bill um I don't know
 
05:14:33.910 --> 05:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
the particulars have not been to my
 
05:14:36.070 --> 05:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
colleagues district and her constituent
 
05:14:39.548 --> 05:14:39.558 align:start position:0%
home to observe in person the situation
 
05:14:42.510 --> 05:14:42.520 align:start position:0%
however all of our law just not just in
 
05:14:46.030 --> 05:14:46.040 align:start position:0%
the state but federal law um scotus
 
05:14:49.230 --> 05:14:49.240 align:start position:0%
interpretation of law um including even
 
05:14:51.948 --> 05:14:51.958 align:start position:0%
things like medical law everything goes
 
05:14:54.150 --> 05:14:54.160 align:start position:0%
back to privacy being a reasonable
 
05:14:56.230 --> 05:14:56.240 align:start position:0%
expectation of privacy do you have a
 
05:14:59.510 --> 05:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
reasonable expectation of privacy if you
 
05:15:01.230 --> 05:15:01.240 align:start position:0%
have a reasonable expectation of privacy
 
05:15:03.190 --> 05:15:03.200 align:start position:0%
and not to bring into in into the
 
05:15:06.270 --> 05:15:06.280 align:start position:0%
conversation the bill two bills ago on
 
05:15:09.190 --> 05:15:09.200 align:start position:0%
recording instances of domestic violence
 
05:15:10.868 --> 05:15:10.878 align:start position:0%
but if that's happening in public on the
 
05:15:12.548 --> 05:15:12.558 align:start position:0%
street you don't need anybody's
 
05:15:14.270 --> 05:15:14.280 align:start position:0%
permission because there's no reasonable
 
05:15:15.990 --> 05:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
expectation of privacy you can take a
 
05:15:17.708 --> 05:15:17.718 align:start position:0%
video of something happening in the
 
05:15:19.948 --> 05:15:19.958 align:start position:0%
street we see that all the time on Tik
 
05:15:22.350 --> 05:15:22.360 align:start position:0%
Tok or what have you but if it's in an
 
05:15:25.230 --> 05:15:25.240 align:start position:0%
area like in a room your bedroom between
 
05:15:27.708 --> 05:15:27.718 align:start position:0%
two people now you need that two-party
 
05:15:29.910 --> 05:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
consent right now it's a reasonable
 
05:15:31.548 --> 05:15:31.558 align:start position:0%
expectation of privacy and you need
 
05:15:34.708 --> 05:15:34.718 align:start position:0%
consent and the question is do we as a
 
05:15:36.868 --> 05:15:36.878 align:start position:0%
society think that our backyards not the
 
05:15:38.310 --> 05:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
front yards that are exposed to the
 
05:15:39.430 --> 05:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
public Street
 
05:15:41.510 --> 05:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
but the backyards do they have a
 
05:15:43.628 --> 05:15:43.638 align:start position:0%
reasonable expectation of privacy I
 
05:15:46.150 --> 05:15:46.160 align:start position:0%
think we all kind of agree they do we
 
05:15:48.150 --> 05:15:48.160 align:start position:0%
have a reasonable expectation of privacy
 
05:15:50.750 --> 05:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
behind our property where that you can't
 
05:15:54.670 --> 05:15:54.680 align:start position:0%
see from the street and so now this this
 
05:15:56.948 --> 05:15:56.958 align:start position:0%
particular Bill does not make it
 
05:15:59.750 --> 05:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
illegal to record but it provides a
 
05:16:01.590 --> 05:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
private right of action for someone
 
05:16:05.430 --> 05:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
who's doing it to harass or to spy on
 
05:16:07.190 --> 05:16:07.200 align:start position:0%
their neighbor and I think we all know
 
05:16:10.390 --> 05:16:10.400 align:start position:0%
that that's problematic Behavior
 
05:16:12.390 --> 05:16:12.400 align:start position:0%
um so that's kind of there was another
 
05:16:14.430 --> 05:16:14.440 align:start position:0%
question that got raised but I didn't
 
05:16:16.030 --> 05:16:16.040 align:start position:0%
manage to write it down before I forgot
 
05:16:18.670 --> 05:16:18.680 align:start position:0%
it so I'm I'm happy to um answer
 
05:16:21.430 --> 05:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
questions but I just wanted to remind us
 
05:16:24.430 --> 05:16:24.440 align:start position:0%
remind everybody that this is kind of
 
05:16:27.030 --> 05:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
what we've agreed on over case law as a
 
05:16:30.350 --> 05:16:30.360 align:start position:0%
society um both in the state and
 
05:16:33.110 --> 05:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
federally and also we recently cared so
 
05:16:34.548 --> 05:16:34.558 align:start position:0%
much about that privacy that the state
 
05:16:36.390 --> 05:16:36.400 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire passed a constitutional
 
05:16:40.470 --> 05:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
amendment um reaffirming our privacy
 
05:16:40.480 --> 05:16:42.350 align:start position:0%
amendment um reaffirming our privacy
representative

05:16:42.350 --> 05:16:42.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:16:45.868 --> 05:16:45.878 align:start position:0%
trip uh thank you for taking my question
 
05:16:49.548 --> 05:16:49.558 align:start position:0%
do you uh is it safe to presume that the
 
05:16:51.470 --> 05:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
the video camera that is installed is
 
05:16:54.548 --> 05:16:54.558 align:start position:0%
capable of uh recording audio yes I was
 
05:16:55.948 --> 05:16:55.958 align:start position:0%
kind of going to go down that rabbit
 
05:16:58.270 --> 05:16:58.280 align:start position:0%
hole so then the question becomes that's
 
05:17:00.830 --> 05:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
a zero party consent video right because
 
05:17:02.948 --> 05:17:02.958 align:start position:0%
the person recording isn't even part of
 
05:17:04.868 --> 05:17:04.878 align:start position:0%
that conversation they're recording
 
05:17:06.470 --> 05:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
other conversations that other people
 
05:17:11.070 --> 05:17:11.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:13.470 --> 05:17:13.480 align:start position:0%
buying actually wiretapping I believe
 
05:17:15.390 --> 05:17:15.400 align:start position:0%
wiretapping so apologies you are the
 
05:17:16.990 --> 05:17:17.000 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee and I stand
 
05:17:19.030 --> 05:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
corrected representative
 
05:17:21.590 --> 05:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
McFarland thank you Mr chairman how
 
05:17:23.430 --> 05:17:23.440 align:start position:0%
large of a rear end does the parcel need
 
05:17:26.310 --> 05:17:26.320 align:start position:0%
to have before there's an expectation of
 
05:17:31.030 --> 05:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:35.510 --> 05:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
that um so again we I I kind of touched
 
05:17:39.390 --> 05:17:39.400 align:start position:0%
on this on the last um Bill where
 
05:17:42.788 --> 05:17:42.798 align:start position:0%
we have intentional ambiguity in
 
05:17:46.788 --> 05:17:46.798 align:start position:0%
language in in in law because we cannot
 
05:17:49.230 --> 05:17:49.240 align:start position:0%
you know predict every single case that
 
05:17:50.830 --> 05:17:50.840 align:start position:0%
could possibly happen that's why we have
 
05:17:52.708 --> 05:17:52.718 align:start position:0%
the courts to say yes this fell under
 
05:17:55.430 --> 05:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
this um this intent this legislative
 
05:17:57.070 --> 05:17:57.080 align:start position:0%
intent no this didn't fall under that
 
05:17:59.350 --> 05:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
legislative intent that's why we have
 
05:18:01.788 --> 05:18:01.798 align:start position:0%
the judges making those determinations
 
05:18:05.110 --> 05:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
if the committee wanted to say for it's
 
05:18:08.310 --> 05:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
any area that is not visible from the
 
05:18:08.320 --> 05:18:09.510 align:start position:0%
any area that is not visible from the
street

05:18:09.510 --> 05:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
street
 
05:18:11.190 --> 05:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
then you could do that or you could come
 
05:18:12.868 --> 05:18:12.878 align:start position:0%
up with some other definition or some
 
05:18:16.670 --> 05:18:16.680 align:start position:0%
like you know um footage or whatever but
 
05:18:18.590 --> 05:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
I think the the the thing that's
 
05:18:20.868 --> 05:18:20.878 align:start position:0%
important here is that we all have a
 
05:18:22.190 --> 05:18:22.200 align:start position:0%
sense that there are parts of our
 
05:18:24.470 --> 05:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
property that are not viewable from the
 
05:18:26.350 --> 05:18:26.360 align:start position:0%
street by the public that we should have
 
05:18:28.830 --> 05:18:28.840 align:start position:0%
a right to expectation or expectation to
 
05:18:33.510 --> 05:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
privacy on to privacy and um and
 
05:18:35.910 --> 05:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
therefore people should not be SP I'm
 
05:18:40.230 --> 05:18:40.240 align:start position:0%
sorry wiretapping spying on us
 
05:18:43.270 --> 05:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions seeing
 
05:18:50.350 --> 05:18:50.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:59.390 --> 05:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:01.150 --> 05:19:01.160 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair
 
05:19:01.160 --> 05:19:02.110 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair
honorable

05:19:02.110 --> 05:19:02.120 align:start position:0%
honorable
 
05:19:05.190 --> 05:19:05.200 align:start position:0%
committee I I like the premise behind
 
05:19:06.708 --> 05:19:06.718 align:start position:0%
this bill and I'm reluctant to say that
 
05:19:08.190 --> 05:19:08.200 align:start position:0%
I'm supporting it without certain
 
05:19:10.270 --> 05:19:10.280 align:start position:0%
amendments because of of further
 
05:19:12.948 --> 05:19:12.958 align:start position:0%
implications and the first one is um I
 
05:19:15.948 --> 05:19:15.958 align:start position:0%
want to caution intent versus innocuous
 
05:19:18.350 --> 05:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
viewing um so like my house has a
 
05:19:20.190 --> 05:19:20.200 align:start position:0%
staggered backyard and I have a rear
 
05:19:21.830 --> 05:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
camera my tenants have a dog that they
 
05:19:24.788 --> 05:19:24.798 align:start position:0%
let out you know on my property Etc but
 
05:19:26.948 --> 05:19:26.958 align:start position:0%
based on the shape of my yard I have an
 
05:19:28.510 --> 05:19:28.520 align:start position:0%
innocuous viewing of my neighbor's
 
05:19:30.430 --> 05:19:30.440 align:start position:0%
backyard now I'm not pointed that way
 
05:19:32.910 --> 05:19:32.920 align:start position:0%
they're just offset so I like motion
 
05:19:33.948 --> 05:19:33.958 align:start position:0%
detector will tell me when they're
 
05:19:36.430 --> 05:19:36.440 align:start position:0%
walking their dog um that's not spying
 
05:19:38.910 --> 05:19:38.920 align:start position:0%
on them that is overwatching my backyard
 
05:19:40.708 --> 05:19:40.718 align:start position:0%
and just by virtue of where their house
 
05:19:43.548 --> 05:19:43.558 align:start position:0%
is located I catch a portion of theirs
 
05:19:46.270 --> 05:19:46.280 align:start position:0%
so if this isn't worded very carefully
 
05:19:49.470 --> 05:19:49.480 align:start position:0%
to establish intent very smartly um I
 
05:19:50.910 --> 05:19:50.920 align:start position:0%
could be committing a crime just by
 
05:19:52.350 --> 05:19:52.360 align:start position:0%
overviewing my backyard because of the
 
05:19:54.910 --> 05:19:54.920 align:start position:0%
shape of the Lots the second concern
 
05:19:58.670 --> 05:19:58.680 align:start position:0%
that I have is uh on lines 12 and 13
 
05:20:00.150 --> 05:20:00.160 align:start position:0%
Provisions shall not apply any law
 
05:20:02.510 --> 05:20:02.520 align:start position:0%

already covered under a code of law and
 
05:20:11.750 --> 05:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
the law enforcement warrant would not
 
05:20:13.868 --> 05:20:13.878 align:start position:0%
give law enforcement the right to
 
05:20:17.628 --> 05:20:17.638 align:start position:0%
subpoena my camera as a neighbor without
 
05:20:19.868 --> 05:20:19.878 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's like you get into a
 
05:20:22.350 --> 05:20:22.360 align:start position:0%
right to privacy with the neighbors if
 
05:20:23.708 --> 05:20:23.718 align:start position:0%
law enforcement thinks that they can
 
05:20:26.310 --> 05:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
start pulling neighbors cameras um or
 
05:20:27.868 --> 05:20:27.878 align:start position:0%
that they can do surveillance for my
 
05:20:30.190 --> 05:20:30.200 align:start position:0%
property I've actually told um I've told
 
05:20:33.310 --> 05:20:33.320 align:start position:0%
a local inspector to get off my property
 
05:20:35.110 --> 05:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
because they parked in my yard watching
 
05:20:36.628 --> 05:20:36.638 align:start position:0%
construction next door because they
 
05:20:38.670 --> 05:20:38.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to catch them doing something and
 
05:20:40.510 --> 05:20:40.520 align:start position:0%
and I don't consent you using my
 
05:20:43.390 --> 05:20:43.400 align:start position:0%
property to spy on my neighbors so I I
 
05:20:45.590 --> 05:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
think that 11 and 12 um those lines
 
05:20:46.628 --> 05:20:46.638 align:start position:0%
would need to be struck from this
 
05:20:47.948 --> 05:20:47.958 align:start position:0%
entirely because there's already
 
05:20:50.230 --> 05:20:50.240 align:start position:0%
codified into law what law enforcement
 
05:20:51.910 --> 05:20:51.920 align:start position:0%
has the right to do with
 
05:20:54.190 --> 05:20:54.200 align:start position:0%
warrants so that's that's my thoughts on
 
05:20:56.150 --> 05:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
this situation thank you for your time
 
05:20:56.160 --> 05:20:57.190 align:start position:0%

questions seeing none thank
 
05:21:02.910 --> 05:21:02.920 align:start position:0%

05:21:06.350 --> 05:21:06.360 align:start position:0%

05:27:30.990 --> 05:27:31.000 align:start position:0%
open up an executive session on House
 
05:27:32.948 --> 05:27:32.958 align:start position:0%
Bill 5
 
05:27:35.350 --> 05:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
93 and I recognize representative
 
05:27:38.310 --> 05:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
mcfallen for motion
 
05:27:39.628 --> 05:27:39.638 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I move in
 
05:27:41.910 --> 05:27:41.920 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate is there a second
 
05:27:44.230 --> 05:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
I'll second that representative trip
 
05:27:47.230 --> 05:27:47.240 align:start position:0%
seconds you want to speak to your
 
05:27:50.430 --> 05:27:50.440 align:start position:0%
motion certainly um let me just pish the
 
05:27:51.830 --> 05:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
paper out
 
05:27:55.590 --> 05:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
here it seems to me that while there is
 
05:27:58.830 --> 05:27:58.840 align:start position:0%
some laudable intent uh in the sponsors
 
05:28:01.750 --> 05:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
bill the bill is written in such a
 
05:28:09.350 --> 05:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
fashion as to uh be unworkable uh and uh
 
05:28:12.270 --> 05:28:12.280 align:start position:0%
even simple things including uh the lack
 
05:28:14.030 --> 05:28:14.040 align:start position:0%
of definition of a pet the lack of
 
05:28:16.310 --> 05:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
specification of whether or not the loss
 
05:28:18.270 --> 05:28:18.280 align:start position:0%
of Consortium only applies to the owner
 
05:28:21.868 --> 05:28:21.878 align:start position:0%
of the pet uh or to other parties um the
 
05:28:23.948 --> 05:28:23.958 align:start position:0%
lack of distinction between an
 
05:28:26.030 --> 05:28:26.040 align:start position:0%
intentional death that was with the
 
05:28:29.350 --> 05:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
owner's instruction or intent uh versus
 
05:28:31.670 --> 05:28:31.680 align:start position:0%
an intentional death by a third party
 
05:28:33.390 --> 05:28:33.400 align:start position:0%
without the owner's instruction or
 
05:28:35.548 --> 05:28:35.558 align:start position:0%
intent and so on and so forth and I
 
05:28:37.230 --> 05:28:37.240 align:start position:0%
think we've heard strong testimony from
 
05:28:39.590 --> 05:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
the um American Kennel Club and dog
 
05:28:41.070 --> 05:28:41.080 align:start position:0%
owners of the Granite State against it
 
05:28:43.830 --> 05:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
as well thank you representative trip do
 
05:28:45.510 --> 05:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
you want to speak to you a
 
05:28:49.430 --> 05:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
second uh I remember this bill from last
 
05:28:53.350 --> 05:28:53.360 align:start position:0%
term uh it's uh it's well-intentioned
 
05:28:56.708 --> 05:28:56.718 align:start position:0%
but I think it has uh unintended
 
05:29:00.510 --> 05:29:00.520 align:start position:0%
consequences that uh make it uh uh
 
05:29:02.628 --> 05:29:02.638 align:start position:0%
unable unable to
 
05:29:02.638 --> 05:29:04.708 align:start position:0%
unable unable to
uh

05:29:04.708 --> 05:29:04.718 align:start position:0%

05:29:08.510 --> 05:29:08.520 align:start position:0%

the remarks
 
05:29:20.990 --> 05:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
about at one point in time women were
 
05:29:23.910 --> 05:29:23.920 align:start position:0%
recognized as being property or chatt of
 
05:29:26.110 --> 05:29:26.120 align:start position:0%
their husbands or
 
05:29:30.030 --> 05:29:30.040 align:start position:0%
fathers and the concept of ownership of
 
05:29:33.830 --> 05:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
pets may be changing over time so I
 
05:29:35.948 --> 05:29:35.958 align:start position:0%

Region um thank you very much for
 
05:46:35.110 --> 05:46:35.120 align:start position:0%
hearing uh House Bill
 
05:46:38.548 --> 05:46:38.558 align:start position:0%
614 Abraham Lincoln once said don't
 
05:46:40.190 --> 05:46:40.200 align:start position:0%
interfere with anything in the
 
05:46:42.948 --> 05:46:42.958 align:start position:0%
Constitution that must be maintained for
 
05:46:45.708 --> 05:46:45.718 align:start position:0%
it is the only Safeguard of our
 
05:46:48.110 --> 05:46:48.120 align:start position:0%
liberties uh I believe the same holds
 
05:46:50.190 --> 05:46:50.200 align:start position:0%
true for our New Hampshire
 
05:46:53.270 --> 05:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
Constitution but what happens if your
 
05:46:55.830 --> 05:46:55.840 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights are
 
05:46:58.310 --> 05:46:58.320 align:start position:0%
violated what happens if your freedom of
 
05:47:00.708 --> 05:47:00.718 align:start position:0%
speech is
 
05:47:03.830 --> 05:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
violated uh a year ago there was a local
 
05:47:06.948 --> 05:47:06.958 align:start position:0%
freedom of speech uh case that uh caught
 
05:47:09.070 --> 05:47:09.080 align:start position:0%
my attention and I view it as a freedom
 
05:47:12.990 --> 05:47:13.000 align:start position:0%
of speech case um this case involved an
 
05:47:17.030 --> 05:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
exitor high school student uh a freshman
 
05:47:19.230 --> 05:47:19.240 align:start position:0%
uh on the football team who was on the
 
05:47:23.430 --> 05:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
school bus and mentioned to his friends
 
05:47:25.190 --> 05:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
that uh he believed that there were only
 
05:47:25.200 --> 05:47:26.548 align:start position:0%
that uh he believed that there were only
two

05:47:26.548 --> 05:47:26.558 align:start position:0%
two
 
05:47:29.270 --> 05:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
genders another student overheard the
 
05:47:32.230 --> 05:47:32.240 align:start position:0%
conversation and argued the point and
 
05:47:35.990 --> 05:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
even later texted that student um who
 
05:47:37.948 --> 05:47:37.958 align:start position:0%
had made the original comment and a
 
05:47:41.868 --> 05:47:41.878 align:start position:0%
brief argument EXC uh excuse me
 
05:47:44.990 --> 05:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
ensued the next day that student who had
 
05:47:48.350 --> 05:47:48.360 align:start position:0%
overheard the uh comment contacted the
 
05:47:50.788 --> 05:47:50.798 align:start position:0%
athletic director and accused The
 
05:47:55.510 --> 05:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
Freshman of I quote transphobic
 
05:47:59.430 --> 05:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
bullying the principal and the ad were
 
05:48:02.670 --> 05:48:02.680 align:start position:0%
contacted and decided the Freshman
 
05:48:04.750 --> 05:48:04.760 align:start position:0%
should be suspended from the football
 
05:48:07.910 --> 05:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
team for a period of time
 
05:48:09.830 --> 05:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
based on this
 
05:48:13.270 --> 05:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
bullying the suspended freshman filed
 
05:48:16.110 --> 05:48:16.120 align:start position:0%
suit in Rockingham Superior
 
05:48:19.110 --> 05:48:19.120 align:start position:0%
Court in court the school officials
 
05:48:20.788 --> 05:48:20.798 align:start position:0%
argued that he was suspended for
 
05:48:23.830 --> 05:48:23.840 align:start position:0%
bullying and inappropriate language in
 
05:48:25.590 --> 05:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
the text
 
05:48:27.910 --> 05:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
conversation the judge as you'll see in
 
05:48:30.310 --> 05:48:30.320 align:start position:0%
some of the Articles uh did not buy
 
05:48:30.320 --> 05:48:31.590 align:start position:0%
some of the Articles uh did not buy
their

05:48:31.590 --> 05:48:31.600 align:start position:0%
their
 
05:48:35.548 --> 05:48:35.558 align:start position:0%
position and found them and I
 
05:48:37.390 --> 05:48:37.400 align:start position:0%
quote but
 
05:48:41.310 --> 05:48:41.320 align:start position:0%
he he found for the uh
 
05:48:45.350 --> 05:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
school and the reason is in this quote
 
05:48:46.788 --> 05:48:46.798 align:start position:0%
which is from one of the
 
05:48:49.230 --> 05:48:49.240 align:start position:0%
Articles because New Hampshire law does
 
05:48:52.230 --> 05:48:52.240 align:start position:0%
not recognize a private cause of action
 
05:48:54.430 --> 05:48:54.440 align:start position:0%
for a political subdivision of a
 
05:48:57.750 --> 05:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
plaintiff's State constitutional rights
 
05:49:01.548 --> 05:49:01.558 align:start position:0%
in the absence of bodily injury property
 
05:49:04.590 --> 05:49:04.600 align:start position:0%
damage personal injury or statute the
 
05:49:07.430 --> 05:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
court grants judgment to the
 
05:49:10.190 --> 05:49:10.200 align:start position:0%
defendants that's the quote of the judge
 
05:49:11.350 --> 05:49:11.360 align:start position:0%
from his
 
05:49:15.670 --> 05:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
ruling so the Freshman walked out of
 
05:49:20.510 --> 05:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
court with the court finding his favor
 
05:49:22.910 --> 05:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
but the law was against
 
05:49:26.750 --> 05:49:26.760 align:start position:0%
him that's what called on me to file
 
05:49:26.760 --> 05:49:28.510 align:start position:0%
him that's what called on me to file
this

05:49:28.510 --> 05:49:28.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:49:31.390 --> 05:49:31.400 align:start position:0%
legislation as the judge found he was
 
05:49:34.548 --> 05:49:34.558 align:start position:0%
suspended from the football team due to
 
05:49:38.628 --> 05:49:38.638 align:start position:0%
his beliefs and comments freedom of
 
05:49:41.910 --> 05:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
speech there was not a bodily image a
 
05:49:46.548 --> 05:49:46.558 align:start position:0%
bodily damage um or anything like that
 
05:49:49.350 --> 05:49:49.360 align:start position:0%
involved in the case so the law did not
 
05:49:52.468 --> 05:49:52.478 align:start position:0%
provide any remedy for him this was a
 
05:49:53.670 --> 05:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
case of
 
05:49:57.350 --> 05:49:57.360 align:start position:0%
speech this simple legislation provides
 
05:49:59.948 --> 05:49:59.958 align:start position:0%
for any complete violation of a person's
 
05:50:02.270 --> 05:50:02.280 align:start position:0%
confident confidential rights
 
05:50:04.590 --> 05:50:04.600 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights excuse me the
 
05:50:07.948 --> 05:50:07.958 align:start position:0%
court shall provide relief as indicated
 
05:50:13.270 --> 05:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
in Roman 1 in the um in the uh
 
05:50:17.110 --> 05:50:17.120 align:start position:0%
legislation beginning on lines on line
 
05:50:21.510 --> 05:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
nine and this is to be provided even if
 
05:50:24.750 --> 05:50:24.760 align:start position:0%
monetary damages are not alleged as in
 
05:50:27.190 --> 05:50:27.200 align:start position:0%
the exer
 
05:50:30.310 --> 05:50:30.320 align:start position:0%
case I think that this is important
 
05:50:30.320 --> 05:50:31.830 align:start position:0%
case I think that this is important
legislation

05:50:31.830 --> 05:50:31.840 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
05:50:34.948 --> 05:50:34.958 align:start position:0%
because we need to defend our
 
05:50:37.230 --> 05:50:37.240 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights
 
05:50:41.190 --> 05:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
and it's I don't think it's sufficient
 
05:50:43.948 --> 05:50:43.958 align:start position:0%
to say you only have a remedy for a
 
05:50:46.548 --> 05:50:46.558 align:start position:0%
violation of your rights if there's uh
 
05:50:48.708 --> 05:50:48.718 align:start position:0%
bodily damage or
 
05:50:52.468 --> 05:50:52.478 align:start position:0%
monetary um issues involved with the uh
 
05:50:55.628 --> 05:50:55.638 align:start position:0%
with the case um such as a freedom of
 
05:50:59.468 --> 05:50:59.478 align:start position:0%
speech case so
 
05:51:04.868 --> 05:51:04.878 align:start position:0%
um I would hope that you would think
 
05:51:07.310 --> 05:51:07.320 align:start position:0%
about the
 
05:51:09.590 --> 05:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
quote that I began with with Abraham
 
05:51:11.948 --> 05:51:11.958 align:start position:0%
Lincoln and
 
05:51:15.990 --> 05:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
the requirement that we protect our
 
05:51:18.750 --> 05:51:18.760 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights and our liberties
 
05:51:21.670 --> 05:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
and um find favorably on this
 
05:51:23.510 --> 05:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
legislation and I thank you very much
 
05:51:24.510 --> 05:51:24.520 align:start position:0%
for your
 
05:51:26.830 --> 05:51:26.840 align:start position:0%
time are there any
 
05:51:30.270 --> 05:51:30.280 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
05:51:32.590 --> 05:51:32.600 align:start position:0%
McFarland I'm sympathetic to the
 
05:51:35.628 --> 05:51:35.638 align:start position:0%
testimony um I'm not a lawyer though and
 
05:51:37.670 --> 05:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
so I I would appreciate
 
05:51:40.310 --> 05:51:40.320 align:start position:0%
clarification of what is intended by
 
05:51:50.548 --> 05:51:50.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:55.150 --> 05:51:55.160 align:start position:0%
14 um I believe that there is a lawyer
 
05:51:57.910 --> 05:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
um in the audience who was submitted a
 
05:52:00.548 --> 05:52:00.558 align:start position:0%
card and I think uh he would have a
 
05:52:02.590 --> 05:52:02.600 align:start position:0%
better answer for you than I thank you
 
05:52:04.708 --> 05:52:04.718 align:start position:0%

seeing none thank you thank you very
 
05:52:13.868 --> 05:52:13.878 align:start position:0%

somebody else wants to speak they can
 
05:52:18.788 --> 05:52:18.798 align:start position:0%

05:52:26.430 --> 05:52:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:29.548 --> 05:52:29.558 align:start position:0%
then okay all right if you want to if
 
05:52:30.670 --> 05:52:30.680 align:start position:0%
you want to sit down and you can fill it
 
05:52:32.548 --> 05:52:32.558 align:start position:0%
out afterwards and then you maybe help
 
05:52:33.708 --> 05:52:33.718 align:start position:0%
answer that question and then we'll go
 
05:52:37.948 --> 05:52:37.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:41.270 --> 05:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:44.070 --> 05:52:44.080 align:start position:0%
can Ian huitt attorney for Cornerstone
 
05:52:47.350 --> 05:52:47.360 align:start position:0%
and support of House Bill
 
05:52:50.390 --> 05:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
614 uh this bill now full disclosure by
 
05:52:51.750 --> 05:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
the way I should say at the outset I'm
 
05:52:53.270 --> 05:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
litigating the exitor case that
 
05:52:55.708 --> 05:52:55.718 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli spoke about so I
 
05:52:57.190 --> 05:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
was obviously happy when he told me he
 
05:52:59.750 --> 05:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to introduce this legislation but
 
05:53:01.468 --> 05:53:01.478 align:start position:0%
the topic that's being addressed by this
 
05:53:04.788 --> 05:53:04.798 align:start position:0%
bill is much much broader than anything
 
05:53:06.548 --> 05:53:06.558 align:start position:0%
that was raised in my case including
 
05:53:10.030 --> 05:53:10.040 align:start position:0%
gender or even Free Speech the problem
 
05:53:12.948 --> 05:53:12.958 align:start position:0%
that this bill addresses is that all
 
05:53:15.150 --> 05:53:15.160 align:start position:0%
everyone agrees all courts have held in
 
05:53:16.670 --> 05:53:16.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire under our state
 
05:53:19.548 --> 05:53:19.558 align:start position:0%
constitution if your rights are being
 
05:53:21.948 --> 05:53:21.958 align:start position:0%
violated on an ongoing basis or there's
 
05:53:23.868 --> 05:53:23.878 align:start position:0%
a threatened future violation of your
 
05:53:26.310 --> 05:53:26.320 align:start position:0%
rights everyone agrees you have a right
 
05:53:28.788 --> 05:53:28.798 align:start position:0%
to relief under our state constitution
 
05:53:30.270 --> 05:53:30.280 align:start position:0%
and our state courts even if you just
 
05:53:33.110 --> 05:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
ignore the Federal Constitution but if
 
05:53:35.548 --> 05:53:35.558 align:start position:0%
there's a completed violation of your
 
05:53:38.750 --> 05:53:38.760 align:start position:0%
rights in the past past no New Hampshire
 
05:53:40.708 --> 05:53:40.718 align:start position:0%
Court has ever held that you have a
 
05:53:43.788 --> 05:53:43.798 align:start position:0%
right to any remedy whatsoever even a
 
05:53:47.270 --> 05:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
nominal damages award for that violation
 
05:53:50.270 --> 05:53:50.280 align:start position:0%
if it's a retrospective violation you
 
05:53:51.990 --> 05:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
have no right to any retrospective
 
05:53:53.830 --> 05:53:53.840 align:start position:0%
remedy not even nominal damages not even
 
05:53:55.990 --> 05:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
declaratory damages the court can't even
 
05:53:58.468 --> 05:53:58.478 align:start position:0%
say you win and you get nothing no right
 
05:54:01.548 --> 05:54:01.558 align:start position:0%
to relief so when representative
 
05:54:03.030 --> 05:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
cordelli told me he wanted to introduce
 
05:54:04.830 --> 05:54:04.840 align:start position:0%
this bill to address this I was excited
 
05:54:08.430 --> 05:54:08.440 align:start position:0%
about it um but I will say that I
 
05:54:10.868 --> 05:54:10.878 align:start position:0%
definitely don't see this bill as any
 
05:54:13.670 --> 05:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
kind of rebuke to judge Schulman's
 
05:54:15.750 --> 05:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
decision the trial court judge in this
 
05:54:17.708 --> 05:54:17.718 align:start position:0%
case I think he's a great jurist
 
05:54:19.830 --> 05:54:19.840 align:start position:0%
actually um the opinion was largely
 
05:54:23.468 --> 05:54:23.478 align:start position:0%
favorable and judge Schulman was right
 
05:54:25.910 --> 05:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
to say no New Hampshire Court has ever
 
05:54:28.150 --> 05:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
held that if you bring a New Hampshire
 
05:54:29.510 --> 05:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
constitutional suit you have a right to
 
05:54:31.110 --> 05:54:31.120 align:start position:0%
retrospective relief now that's all
 
05:54:32.750 --> 05:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
rights that's not just free speech
 
05:54:35.310 --> 05:54:35.320 align:start position:0%
that's free speech right to bear arms
 
05:54:37.990 --> 05:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
right to freedom of the press any right
 
05:54:39.708 --> 05:54:39.718 align:start position:0%
if it's in the past you're not going to
 
05:54:41.510 --> 05:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
get relief unless you go into federal
 
05:54:43.190 --> 05:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
court under the Federal Constitution
 
05:54:45.910 --> 05:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
instead of going into our state courts
 
05:54:47.548 --> 05:54:47.558 align:start position:0%
and this is something that this
 
05:54:50.350 --> 05:54:50.360 align:start position:0%
legislature can fix if we want people in
 
05:54:52.468 --> 05:54:52.478 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to be able to rely on our
 
05:54:53.868 --> 05:54:53.878 align:start position:0%
state courts and we want New Hampshire
 
05:54:55.910 --> 05:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
to be independent and we don't want
 
05:54:57.708 --> 05:54:57.718 align:start position:0%
Granite Staters to have to rely on and
 
05:54:59.708 --> 05:54:59.718 align:start position:0%
essentially be dictated to by what
 
05:55:02.590 --> 05:55:02.600 align:start position:0%
federal courts happen to say at that
 
05:55:05.670 --> 05:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
moment so I actually have a case before
 
05:55:06.990 --> 05:55:07.000 align:start position:0%
the state supreme sueme court right now
 
05:55:09.070 --> 05:55:09.080 align:start position:0%
where I have like a 50-page brief that
 
05:55:11.548 --> 05:55:11.558 align:start position:0%
basically is arguing the New Hampshire
 
05:55:13.868 --> 05:55:13.878 align:start position:0%
Constitution itself entitles you to
 
05:55:15.468 --> 05:55:15.478 align:start position:0%
retrospective relief if you look at the
 
05:55:18.430 --> 05:55:18.440 align:start position:0%
text or the history of the Constitution
 
05:55:22.110 --> 05:55:22.120 align:start position:0%
but even if I win that it is a good idea
 
05:55:24.310 --> 05:55:24.320 align:start position:0%
for the general court to have a statute
 
05:55:27.510 --> 05:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
addressing this just like under federal
 
05:55:30.110 --> 05:55:30.120 align:start position:0%
constitutional law you can bring a 14th
 
05:55:32.628 --> 05:55:32.638 align:start position:0%
Amendment suit or if you don't bring a
 
05:55:34.190 --> 05:55:34.200 align:start position:0%
14th Amendment suit you can bring a
 
05:55:37.230 --> 05:55:37.240 align:start position:0%
section 1983 suit under a statute that
 
05:55:39.628 --> 05:55:39.638 align:start position:0%
Congress passed in 1871 and they
 
05:55:42.548 --> 05:55:42.558 align:start position:0%
basically passed that to back stop our
 
05:55:44.830 --> 05:55:44.840 align:start position:0%
federal constitutional rights and make
 
05:55:46.948 --> 05:55:46.958 align:start position:0%
sure you have a remedy in court and that
 
05:55:48.548 --> 05:55:48.558 align:start position:0%
is what that that is what the
 
05:55:50.430 --> 05:55:50.440 align:start position:0%
legislature would be doing by passing
 
05:55:54.030 --> 05:55:54.040 align:start position:0%
this law so regardless of what uh you
 
05:55:55.750 --> 05:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
may think about what the framers of our
 
05:55:58.230 --> 05:55:58.240 align:start position:0%
state constitution intended I would say
 
05:55:59.788 --> 05:55:59.798 align:start position:0%
if you just think about it logically and
 
05:56:01.708 --> 05:56:01.718 align:start position:0%
from a standpoint of basic fairness it
 
05:56:03.350 --> 05:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
really just does not make sense it's
 
05:56:05.830 --> 05:56:05.840 align:start position:0%
kind of a fluke to say you have a right
 
05:56:07.910 --> 05:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
to Rel if there's a threatened future or
 
05:56:09.830 --> 05:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
an ongoing violation but if it happened
 
05:56:11.948 --> 05:56:11.958 align:start position:0%
in the past you have no right to relief
 
05:56:13.788 --> 05:56:13.798 align:start position:0%
a right is a right you should be
 
05:56:16.270 --> 05:56:16.280 align:start position:0%
entitled to some sort of Remedy and I
 
05:56:18.070 --> 05:56:18.080 align:start position:0%
would love to take any questions but one
 
05:56:20.948 --> 05:56:20.958 align:start position:0%
thing I'll say is really any possible
 
05:56:22.628 --> 05:56:22.638 align:start position:0%
political objection I can think of to
 
05:56:24.750 --> 05:56:24.760 align:start position:0%
this bill whether that's uh what about
 
05:56:26.990 --> 05:56:27.000 align:start position:0%
frivolous suits we have to deal with how
 
05:56:28.670 --> 05:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
do we deal with the various official
 
05:56:31.110 --> 05:56:31.120 align:start position:0%
immunity claims my answer to all those
 
05:56:33.030 --> 05:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
is going to be pretty simple which is
 
05:56:35.310 --> 05:56:35.320 align:start position:0%
our courts already know exactly how to
 
05:56:36.830 --> 05:56:36.840 align:start position:0%
deal with all those question questions
 
05:56:40.430 --> 05:56:40.440 align:start position:0%
under ongoing and prospective claims and
 
05:56:42.990 --> 05:56:43.000 align:start position:0%
under federal constitutional claims uh
 
05:56:44.788 --> 05:56:44.798 align:start position:0%
they have an extensive body of case law
 
05:56:46.310 --> 05:56:46.320 align:start position:0%
that will analyze any one of those
 
05:56:48.830 --> 05:56:48.840 align:start position:0%
issues that I just raised so just the
 
05:56:51.788 --> 05:56:51.798 align:start position:0%
last thing I'll note here is that New
 
05:56:53.708 --> 05:56:53.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has the second oldest
 
05:56:55.670 --> 05:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
continuously existing constitution in
 
05:56:58.390 --> 05:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
the western world uh after Massachusetts
 
05:57:00.830 --> 05:57:00.840 align:start position:0%
our constitution goes back to
 
05:57:03.910 --> 05:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
1784 and when our constitution was being
 
05:57:06.868 --> 05:57:06.878 align:start position:0%
passed Granite Staters three times
 
05:57:08.990 --> 05:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
rejected in popular votes the
 
05:57:10.510 --> 05:57:10.520 align:start position:0%
Constitution that was proposed to them
 
05:57:11.990 --> 05:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
because it didn't provide the people
 
05:57:13.830 --> 05:57:13.840 align:start position:0%
enough rights against the government and
 
05:57:15.788 --> 05:57:15.798 align:start position:0%
the framers kept adding more and more
 
05:57:17.708 --> 05:57:17.718 align:start position:0%
rights until they had something that the
 
05:57:19.270 --> 05:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire were satisfied
 
05:57:22.150 --> 05:57:22.160 align:start position:0%
with our constitution takes as its model
 
05:57:24.230 --> 05:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
John Adams original Massachusetts
 
05:57:26.270 --> 05:57:26.280 align:start position:0%
Constitution but if you compare the two
 
05:57:27.868 --> 05:57:27.878 align:start position:0%
if you look at our Constitution and you
 
05:57:30.310 --> 05:57:30.320 align:start position:0%
look at massachusetts's you'll find
 
05:57:32.390 --> 05:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts is just sounds relatively
 
05:57:34.868 --> 05:57:34.878 align:start position:0%
weak it's got the same rights but our
 
05:57:37.830 --> 05:57:37.840 align:start position:0%
framers put a lot more kind of fanatical
 
05:57:39.270 --> 05:57:39.280 align:start position:0%
emphasis on those rights because they
 
05:57:40.868 --> 05:57:40.878 align:start position:0%
wanted to emphasize the government would
 
05:57:43.030 --> 05:57:43.040 align:start position:0%
be restrained the people have strong
 
05:57:44.708 --> 05:57:44.718 align:start position:0%
rights and we want to assure you granted
 
05:57:46.270 --> 05:57:46.280 align:start position:0%
Staters of that so that you'll approve
 
05:57:48.190 --> 05:57:48.200 align:start position:0%
this constitution so I would say it
 
05:57:50.270 --> 05:57:50.280 align:start position:0%
especially doesn't make any sense in New
 
05:57:51.628 --> 05:57:51.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that we have this kind of
 
05:57:53.788 --> 05:57:53.798 align:start position:0%
historical fluke and oversight where if
 
05:57:56.110 --> 05:57:56.120 align:start position:0%
a violation is in the past uh you have
 
05:57:58.270 --> 05:57:58.280 align:start position:0%
no right to relief so I'd be happy to
 
05:58:00.390 --> 05:58:00.400 align:start position:0%
take any questions about
 
05:58:03.150 --> 05:58:03.160 align:start position:0%
anything representative
 
05:58:05.230 --> 05:58:05.240 align:start position:0%
McFarland thank you Mr chairman I I'll
 
05:58:07.230 --> 05:58:07.240 align:start position:0%
just reiterate my prior question with a
 
05:58:09.990 --> 05:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
little bit more specificity so if I
 
05:58:11.948 --> 05:58:11.958 align:start position:0%
understand you correctly um you're
 
05:58:13.948 --> 05:58:13.958 align:start position:0%
you're asserting in par in section two
 
05:58:16.868 --> 05:58:16.878 align:start position:0%
in in Rose 12 to 14 here um to the
 
05:58:18.628 --> 05:58:18.638 align:start position:0%
extent that you agree with the language
 
05:58:21.430 --> 05:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
you're asserting that um you already had
 
05:58:24.110 --> 05:58:24.120 align:start position:0%
this remedy under the Constitution and
 
05:58:26.430 --> 05:58:26.440 align:start position:0%
that this is also now being granted in
 
05:58:29.750 --> 05:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
this statute um and you already had this
 
05:58:32.270 --> 05:58:32.280 align:start position:0%
remedy in common law and if I'm right
 
05:58:35.270 --> 05:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
about that could you also please clarify
 
05:58:37.708 --> 05:58:37.718 align:start position:0%
uh how this would affect the ability to
 
05:58:39.150 --> 05:58:39.160 align:start position:0%
petition for address of grievances to
 
05:58:40.110 --> 05:58:40.120 align:start position:0%
the general
 
05:58:42.230 --> 05:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
court representative I think you have a
 
05:58:43.708 --> 05:58:43.718 align:start position:0%
pretty comprehensive understanding of
 
05:58:45.310 --> 05:58:45.320 align:start position:0%
the issues I would just add one thing to
 
05:58:47.868 --> 05:58:47.878 align:start position:0%
what you said yes that is part of why
 
05:58:50.750 --> 05:58:50.760 align:start position:0%
section two is worded this way but also
 
05:58:53.230 --> 05:58:53.240 align:start position:0%
our constitutional law in New Hampshire
 
05:58:55.670 --> 05:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
has a weird fluke um separate from what
 
05:58:57.190 --> 05:58:57.200 align:start position:0%
I've just talked about that is not found
 
05:58:59.830 --> 05:58:59.840 align:start position:0%
in other states where when you bring an
 
05:59:03.190 --> 05:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
article 14 claim our state supreme court
 
05:59:04.510 --> 05:59:04.520 align:start position:0%
actually I don't think anyone else does
 
05:59:06.270 --> 05:59:06.280 align:start position:0%
this in the country some kind of
 
05:59:08.708 --> 05:59:08.718 align:start position:0%
constitutional claims when the court is
 
05:59:10.830 --> 05:59:10.840 align:start position:0%
deciding whether you have relief under
 
05:59:13.150 --> 05:59:13.160 align:start position:0%
the state constitution they actually
 
05:59:16.548 --> 05:59:16.558 align:start position:0%
will look to State statutes to decide
 
05:59:17.910 --> 05:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
whether you have
 
05:59:20.830 --> 05:59:20.840 align:start position:0%
constitutional relief so this isn't just
 
05:59:22.430 --> 05:59:22.440 align:start position:0%
kind of a way to say you know we
 
05:59:24.030 --> 05:59:24.040 align:start position:0%
disclaim the idea you don't have a
 
05:59:26.190 --> 05:59:26.200 align:start position:0%
constitutional remedy it actually also
 
05:59:27.910 --> 05:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
could affect the outcome of cases the
 
05:59:29.628 --> 05:59:29.638 align:start position:0%
last example of this most recently was
 
05:59:33.070 --> 05:59:33.080 align:start position:0%
cater k a t r that was in 2010 and
 
05:59:35.430 --> 05:59:35.440 align:start position:0%
basically what happens is the court says
 
05:59:37.190 --> 05:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
if we we we will grant to you a
 
05:59:39.390 --> 05:59:39.400 align:start position:0%
constitutional remedy under article 14
 
05:59:42.190 --> 05:59:42.200 align:start position:0%
in this quasy Equitable way if the
 
05:59:44.948 --> 05:59:44.958 align:start position:0%
general court is not granted you statute
 
05:59:47.390 --> 05:59:47.400 align:start position:0%
and the second part of your question I I
 
05:59:50.150 --> 05:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
don't see the only way in which it would
 
05:59:52.948 --> 05:59:52.958 align:start position:0%
um you know bring there could be a case
 
05:59:54.670 --> 05:59:54.680 align:start position:0%
that addressed the right to petition the
 
05:59:57.670 --> 05:59:57.680 align:start position:0%
general court is I mean the only thing I
 
06:00:00.110 --> 06:00:00.120 align:start position:0%
can think of I'm just thinking on my
 
06:00:03.030 --> 06:00:03.040 align:start position:0%
feet here in spitballing if let's say
 
06:00:05.430 --> 06:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
you uh your right to petition was denied
 
06:00:07.990 --> 06:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
for a long time and then the general
 
06:00:09.948 --> 06:00:09.958 align:start position:0%
court eventually granted your right to
 
06:00:12.270 --> 06:00:12.280 align:start position:0%
petition and so then maybe your
 
06:00:15.150 --> 06:00:15.160 align:start position:0%
prospective claim is moot but you say
 
06:00:17.548 --> 06:00:17.558 align:start position:0%
hey but they unconstitutionally denied
 
06:00:20.070 --> 06:00:20.080 align:start position:0%
my right to petition for a year so you
 
06:00:21.910 --> 06:00:21.920 align:start position:0%
don't have any prospective claim anymore
 
06:00:23.708 --> 06:00:23.718 align:start position:0%
but let's say you say I still want
 
06:00:25.910 --> 06:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
nominal damages or at least declare that
 
06:00:27.990 --> 06:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
what they did was unconstitutional right
 
06:00:30.150 --> 06:00:30.160 align:start position:0%
now that that retrospective claim you
 
06:00:32.270 --> 06:00:32.280 align:start position:0%
don't have because our courts would say
 
06:00:34.110 --> 06:00:34.120 align:start position:0%
retrospective constitutional rights
 
06:00:36.110 --> 06:00:36.120 align:start position:0%
claims no remedy but now you would have
 
06:00:39.070 --> 06:00:39.080 align:start position:0%
one under this Bill thank you yeah any
 
06:00:41.990 --> 06:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
other questions representative tur yeah
 
06:00:43.948 --> 06:00:43.958 align:start position:0%
thanks thanks for taking the question
 
06:00:45.510 --> 06:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering and I do not know this
 
06:00:48.670 --> 06:00:48.680 align:start position:0%
area of the law particularly well um is
 
06:00:52.910 --> 06:00:52.920 align:start position:0%
the difference between the uh future or
 
06:00:55.468 --> 06:00:55.478 align:start position:0%
current uh situation of having your
 
06:00:58.390 --> 06:00:58.400 align:start position:0%
rights violated uh versus what's being
 
06:01:01.030 --> 06:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
discussed in this bill the idea that
 
06:01:03.030 --> 06:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
primarily that would be and maybe I'm
 
06:01:04.750 --> 06:01:04.760 align:start position:0%
misusing the term sort of injunctive
 
06:01:06.670 --> 06:01:06.680 align:start position:0%
relief which says
 
06:01:08.270 --> 06:01:08.280 align:start position:0%
the Court's going to stop your rights
 
06:01:10.628 --> 06:01:10.638 align:start position:0%
from being violated whereas this seems
 
06:01:12.990 --> 06:01:13.000 align:start position:0%
to be awarding damages in a very
 
06:01:13.000 --> 06:01:14.230 align:start position:0%
to be awarding damages in a very
different

06:01:14.230 --> 06:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
different
 
06:01:17.430 --> 06:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
circumstance that is right except that
 
06:01:19.548 --> 06:01:19.558 align:start position:0%
our courts have been very clear that
 
06:01:21.350 --> 06:01:21.360 align:start position:0%
they've never as I think judge Schulman
 
06:01:23.070 --> 06:01:23.080 align:start position:0%
accurately said in his opinion there has
 
06:01:24.868 --> 06:01:24.878 align:start position:0%
never been any case in New Hampshire
 
06:01:27.750 --> 06:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
that says you have any retrospective uh
 
06:01:29.910 --> 06:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
right to relief so this bill kind of
 
06:01:31.868 --> 06:01:31.878 align:start position:0%
pointedly doesn't even really take up
 
06:01:33.868 --> 06:01:33.878 align:start position:0%
directly the monetary damages question
 
06:01:35.230 --> 06:01:35.240 align:start position:0%
and basically just says look you've got
 
06:01:36.750 --> 06:01:36.760 align:start position:0%
some sort of right to relief could be
 
06:01:38.910 --> 06:01:38.920 align:start position:0%
nominal could be declaratory could be
 
06:01:41.390 --> 06:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
some other Equitable relief but you're
 
06:01:43.590 --> 06:01:43.600 align:start position:0%
right you have you have prospective
 
06:01:45.390 --> 06:01:45.400 align:start position:0%
injunctive relief if your constitutional
 
06:01:46.990 --> 06:01:47.000 align:start position:0%
rights are going to be violated in the
 
06:01:48.990 --> 06:01:49.000 align:start position:0%
future but if they've been violated in
 
06:01:50.948 --> 06:01:50.958 align:start position:0%
the past right now not only can you not
 
06:01:52.670 --> 06:01:52.680 align:start position:0%
get monetary damages you can't get
 
06:01:54.948 --> 06:01:54.958 align:start position:0%
anything under the state constitution
 
06:01:56.788 --> 06:01:56.798 align:start position:0%
the um I should address the quote
 
06:01:58.390 --> 06:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli open with from
 
06:02:00.708 --> 06:02:00.718 align:start position:0%
Judge Schulman's opinion the reason that
 
06:02:02.750 --> 06:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
judge Schulman spoke about bodily injury
 
06:02:05.070 --> 06:02:05.080 align:start position:0%
and things like that is you could bring
 
06:02:08.390 --> 06:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
a tort claim against a subdivision or
 
06:02:11.110 --> 06:02:11.120 align:start position:0%
against the state um so if police
 
06:02:13.868 --> 06:02:13.878 align:start position:0%
officer beats you up illegally let's say
 
06:02:15.990 --> 06:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
you might bring a toric claim for bodily
 
06:02:18.548 --> 06:02:18.558 align:start position:0%
injury but you could not bring you
 
06:02:20.150 --> 06:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
couldn't say that police officer
 
06:02:23.390 --> 06:02:23.400 align:start position:0%
violated my state constitutional rights
 
06:02:26.310 --> 06:02:26.320 align:start position:0%
under a b or c provision of our state
 
06:02:28.070 --> 06:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
constitution you would just have to rely
 
06:02:30.628 --> 06:02:30.638 align:start position:0%
on on Tor law or you could under the
 
06:02:32.868 --> 06:02:32.878 align:start position:0%
Federal Constitution go into federal
 
06:02:34.230 --> 06:02:34.240 align:start position:0%
court but people really should be able
 
06:02:35.628 --> 06:02:35.638 align:start position:0%
to remedy these claims in our state
 
06:02:35.638 --> 06:02:37.990 align:start position:0%
to remedy these claims in our state
court

06:02:37.990 --> 06:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:39.788 --> 06:02:39.798 align:start position:0%
thank you any other
 
06:02:42.030 --> 06:02:42.040 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
06:02:44.390 --> 06:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
Manus thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
06:02:46.628 --> 06:02:46.638 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I'm I'm really
 
06:02:51.310 --> 06:02:51.320 align:start position:0%
not clear on what specific remedy it is
 
06:02:54.628 --> 06:02:54.638 align:start position:0%
that you're seeking by way of this
 
06:02:59.190 --> 06:02:59.200 align:start position:0%
statute that I get the nominal damages
 
06:03:02.708 --> 06:03:02.718 align:start position:0%
but isn't a judge going to say whatever
 
06:03:06.390 --> 06:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
the situation is aside from exitor
 
06:03:10.430 --> 06:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
um somebody's State constitutional rats
 
06:03:12.990 --> 06:03:13.000 align:start position:0%
were violated the judge has to say that
 
06:03:15.350 --> 06:03:15.360 align:start position:0%
otherwise there can't be any conclusion
 
06:03:17.670 --> 06:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
to the case there can't be a judgment so
 
06:03:20.270 --> 06:03:20.280 align:start position:0%
just the acknowledgement that somebody's
 
06:03:22.150 --> 06:03:22.160 align:start position:0%
rights were
 
06:03:24.948 --> 06:03:24.958 align:start position:0%
violated is in
 
06:03:27.190 --> 06:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
fact um the
 
06:03:29.910 --> 06:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
remedy you you raise a really good point
 
06:03:32.430 --> 06:03:32.440 align:start position:0%
actually and and in Old nominal damages
 
06:03:35.868 --> 06:03:35.878 align:start position:0%
cases from like the early 19th century
 
06:03:38.030 --> 06:03:38.040 align:start position:0%
justice story on the US Supreme Court
 
06:03:41.230 --> 06:03:41.240 align:start position:0%
said the idea that you can say someone's
 
06:03:43.150 --> 06:03:43.160 align:start position:0%
legal rights were violated but they have
 
06:03:44.990 --> 06:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
no remedy whatsoever not even nominal
 
06:03:46.830 --> 06:03:46.840 align:start position:0%
damages that doesn't even make sense he
 
06:03:49.548 --> 06:03:49.558 align:start position:0%
argued you're just uh it's incoherent
 
06:03:51.990 --> 06:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
because if there is no remedy we would
 
06:03:53.548 --> 06:03:53.558 align:start position:0%
typically say that really isn't a legal
 
06:03:54.910 --> 06:03:54.920 align:start position:0%
right maybe the government did something
 
06:03:56.708 --> 06:03:56.718 align:start position:0%
immoral but they didn't violate your
 
06:03:59.510 --> 06:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
legal rights if you have no remedy in
 
06:04:01.030 --> 06:04:01.040 align:start position:0%
this case I mean this is kind of an
 
06:04:03.310 --> 06:04:03.320 align:start position:0%
illustration of of your question the
 
06:04:07.070 --> 06:04:07.080 align:start position:0%
judge said um you it seems like under
 
06:04:09.548 --> 06:04:09.558 align:start position:0%
the facts here that your rights were
 
06:04:12.628 --> 06:04:12.638 align:start position:0%
violated that the school lied Etc but
 
06:04:15.190 --> 06:04:15.200 align:start position:0%
regardless of any of that you lose
 
06:04:16.468 --> 06:04:16.478 align:start position:0%
because it's a
 
06:04:19.468 --> 06:04:19.478 align:start position:0%
retrospective claim so we we don't even
 
06:04:21.230 --> 06:04:21.240 align:start position:0%
have the right really to declaratory
 
06:04:22.628 --> 06:04:22.638 align:start position:0%
judgment we don't have the right to have
 
06:04:25.708 --> 06:04:25.718 align:start position:0%
the court say you win as long as it's a
 
06:04:27.910 --> 06:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
retrospective claim um the three kinds
 
06:04:29.510 --> 06:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
of remedies that are mentioned in in
 
06:04:31.190 --> 06:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
here are as you mentioned nominal
 
06:04:33.430 --> 06:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
damages declaratory relief and one thing
 
06:04:36.070 --> 06:04:36.080 align:start position:0%
I'll comment on that I I am in you're
 
06:04:38.030 --> 06:04:38.040 align:start position:0%
aware of based on your question is with
 
06:04:40.350 --> 06:04:40.360 align:start position:0%
respect to the other Equitable relief
 
06:04:42.910 --> 06:04:42.920 align:start position:0%
Clause already actually our state
 
06:04:44.628 --> 06:04:44.638 align:start position:0%
Supreme Courts under just general court
 
06:04:46.868 --> 06:04:46.878 align:start position:0%
statutes are courts of equity so that
 
06:04:48.708 --> 06:04:48.718 align:start position:0%
other Equitable relief clause in some
 
06:04:50.468 --> 06:04:50.478 align:start position:0%
ways is just kind of rearticulating the
 
06:04:52.868 --> 06:04:52.878 align:start position:0%
Equitable jurisdiction our state
 
06:04:54.990 --> 06:04:55.000 align:start position:0%
Superior Courts already have so you
 
06:04:56.468 --> 06:04:56.478 align:start position:0%
could interpret this bill as kind of
 
06:04:56.478 --> 06:04:57.590 align:start position:0%
could interpret this bill as kind of
just

06:04:57.590 --> 06:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
just
 
06:05:00.350 --> 06:05:00.360 align:start position:0%
saying you know the minimal possible
 
06:05:02.468 --> 06:05:02.478 align:start position:0%
relief that could remedy a retrospective
 
06:05:06.830 --> 06:05:06.840 align:start position:0%
violation that's the relief you have
 
06:05:10.670 --> 06:05:10.680 align:start position:0%
yeah follow up thank you
 
06:05:13.270 --> 06:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
um but there would have been a judgment
 
06:05:15.830 --> 06:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
entered in this case correct and it
 
06:05:20.468 --> 06:05:20.478 align:start position:0%
would have said a violated B's rights
 
06:05:24.110 --> 06:05:24.120 align:start position:0%
and isn't the person or the entity that
 
06:05:26.548 --> 06:05:26.558 align:start position:0%
violated that person's rights put on
 
06:05:30.230 --> 06:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
notice not to repeat the behavior and of
 
06:05:32.270 --> 06:05:32.280 align:start position:0%
course if they do then you can get
 
06:05:35.070 --> 06:05:35.080 align:start position:0%
declaratory relief and injunctive relief
 
06:05:38.230 --> 06:05:38.240 align:start position:0%
Etc for prospective Behavior or future
 
06:05:41.708 --> 06:05:41.718 align:start position:0%
Behavior well they did win um you know
 
06:05:43.468 --> 06:05:43.478 align:start position:0%
the end of the opinion says that they
 
06:05:46.270 --> 06:05:46.280 align:start position:0%
won and the you know statements from the
 
06:05:48.788 --> 06:05:48.798 align:start position:0%
school in my case for example have been
 
06:05:50.150 --> 06:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
you know we disagree with the judge
 
06:05:52.190 --> 06:05:52.200 align:start position:0%
saying our clients all lied but we're
 
06:05:54.510 --> 06:05:54.520 align:start position:0%
glad we won and and they are right they
 
06:05:57.070 --> 06:05:57.080 align:start position:0%
did win um and I would say you know
 
06:05:59.868 --> 06:05:59.878 align:start position:0%
setting aside the facts of my case in my
 
06:06:01.948 --> 06:06:01.958 align:start position:0%
appeal um my appeal is just on the
 
06:06:03.430 --> 06:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
question presented of does the New
 
06:06:04.788 --> 06:06:04.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution afford
 
06:06:07.150 --> 06:06:07.160 align:start position:0%
retrospective relief for completed
 
06:06:09.110 --> 06:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
violations so we're not talking about
 
06:06:11.628 --> 06:06:11.638 align:start position:0%
gender or what the Free Speech test is
 
06:06:12.990 --> 06:06:13.000 align:start position:0%
or any of that stuff because the judge
 
06:06:14.510 --> 06:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
really kind of decided all that stuff in
 
06:06:16.830 --> 06:06:16.840 align:start position:0%
our favor so um regardless of what you
 
06:06:18.628 --> 06:06:18.638 align:start position:0%
think about the judge's opinion in my
 
06:06:21.190 --> 06:06:21.200 align:start position:0%
case under any future case in the
 
06:06:24.548 --> 06:06:24.558 align:start position:0%
absence of something like this and or uh
 
06:06:26.990 --> 06:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court decision in my favor the
 
06:06:29.030 --> 06:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
Court's going to say anyone whose State
 
06:06:30.510 --> 06:06:30.520 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights were violated you
 
06:06:34.510 --> 06:06:34.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:38.230 --> 06:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
remedy could I just ask yes go
 
06:06:40.830 --> 06:06:40.840 align:start position:0%
ahead me would you be willing to provide
 
06:06:43.230 --> 06:06:43.240 align:start position:0%
us and redacting if if there are minors
 
06:06:45.468 --> 06:06:45.478 align:start position:0%
involved in the case uh would you be
 
06:06:47.310 --> 06:06:47.320 align:start position:0%
willing to provide us with a copy of the
 
06:06:49.390 --> 06:06:49.400 align:start position:0%
Court's opinion absolutely I'd be
 
06:06:50.910 --> 06:06:50.920 align:start position:0%
willing to provide you any documents and
 
06:06:52.750 --> 06:06:52.760 align:start position:0%
they are already all redacted so that'd
 
06:06:55.510 --> 06:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
be very easy thank you representative
 
06:06:58.110 --> 06:06:58.120 align:start position:0%
any other questions seeing none thank
 
06:07:00.070 --> 06:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
06:07:23.910 --> 06:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:25.708 --> 06:07:25.718 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Sarah Burke
 
06:07:27.510 --> 06:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
Cohen I represent the New Hampshire
 
06:07:29.670 --> 06:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association the New Hampshire
 
06:07:32.030 --> 06:07:32.040 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association opposes this bill
 
06:07:34.350 --> 06:07:34.360 align:start position:0%
it is vague and overly broad this bill
 
06:07:36.150 --> 06:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
would allow plaintiffs to layer
 
06:07:38.868 --> 06:07:38.878 align:start position:0%
constitutional claims on top of existing
 
06:07:41.750 --> 06:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
statutory claims for which they already
 
06:07:43.310 --> 06:07:43.320 align:start position:0%
have a
 
06:07:45.788 --> 06:07:45.798 align:start position:0%
remedy currently a violation of the
 
06:07:48.070 --> 06:07:48.080 align:start position:0%
State Constitution will in almost all
 
06:07:50.948 --> 06:07:50.958 align:start position:0%
cases also be a violation of the Federal
 
06:07:52.750 --> 06:07:52.760 align:start position:0%
Constitution so there is already a cause
 
06:07:56.708 --> 06:07:56.718 align:start position:0%
of action under 42 USC section
 
06:07:59.030 --> 06:07:59.040 align:start position:0%
1983 in the few instances where the
 
06:08:00.868 --> 06:08:00.878 align:start position:0%
state constitution provides broader
 
06:08:02.430 --> 06:08:02.440 align:start position:0%
rights than the federal constition There
 
06:08:05.670 --> 06:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
is almost certainly a state statute that
 
06:08:08.350 --> 06:08:08.360 align:start position:0%
already provides a remedy in short there
 
06:08:10.310 --> 06:08:10.320 align:start position:0%
are very few if any gaps where someone
 
06:08:11.990 --> 06:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
whose State constitutional rights are
 
06:08:14.910 --> 06:08:14.920 align:start position:0%
violated would not already have a claim
 
06:08:18.230 --> 06:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
under either federal or state law this
 
06:08:20.590 --> 06:08:20.600 align:start position:0%
bill would allow zoning appeals tax
 
06:08:22.548 --> 06:08:22.558 align:start position:0%
appeals right to no complaints and many
 
06:08:25.110 --> 06:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
other claims to be refra excuse me
 
06:08:28.670 --> 06:08:28.680 align:start position:0%
reframed as constitutional torts for
 
06:08:30.670 --> 06:08:30.680 align:start position:0%
those who think I'm being an alarmist
 
06:08:32.468 --> 06:08:32.478 align:start position:0%
please understand that lawyers have
 
06:08:36.270 --> 06:08:36.280 align:start position:0%
already tried in cases to do this
 
06:08:39.270 --> 06:08:39.280 align:start position:0%
um in one such case in 1986 the New
 
06:08:41.670 --> 06:08:41.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court rejected the
 
06:08:44.030 --> 06:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
effort to turn a local Road dispute into
 
06:08:46.628 --> 06:08:46.638 align:start position:0%
a constitutional claim in that claim
 
06:08:48.990 --> 06:08:49.000 align:start position:0%
Justice sudor wrote as follows we fear
 
06:08:51.468 --> 06:08:51.478 align:start position:0%
that um provision of supplemental cause
 
06:08:53.070 --> 06:08:53.080 align:start position:0%
of action to provide an additional
 
06:08:55.270 --> 06:08:55.280 align:start position:0%
remedy in these circumstances would
 
06:08:57.150 --> 06:08:57.160 align:start position:0%
inevitably lead to the conversion of
 
06:08:59.110 --> 06:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
every road dispute in a constitutional
 
06:09:01.830 --> 06:09:01.840 align:start position:0%
Tor action which would carry a right to
 
06:09:04.788 --> 06:09:04.798 align:start position:0%
a jury trial separate from from the
 
06:09:06.628 --> 06:09:06.638 align:start position:0%
layout of appeal the likely
 
06:09:08.390 --> 06:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
multiplication of litigation resulting
 
06:09:09.990 --> 06:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
from a squabble would be too high a
 
06:09:12.270 --> 06:09:12.280 align:start position:0%
price to pay for such supplemental cause
 
06:09:12.280 --> 06:09:13.468 align:start position:0%
price to pay for such supplemental cause
of

06:09:13.468 --> 06:09:13.478 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:09:17.948 --> 06:09:17.958 align:start position:0%
action in some this bill would open up
 
06:09:20.190 --> 06:09:20.200 align:start position:0%
the 43 articles of part one of the New
 
06:09:22.948 --> 06:09:22.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution and 101 articles
 
06:09:25.230 --> 06:09:25.240 align:start position:0%
in part two of the New Hampshire
 
06:09:28.310 --> 06:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
Constitution and allow allow layering of
 
06:09:30.310 --> 06:09:30.320 align:start position:0%
these constitutional claims on top of
 
06:09:32.628 --> 06:09:32.638 align:start position:0%
existing claims which already have a
 
06:09:35.390 --> 06:09:35.400 align:start position:0%
remedy and create runaway litigation
 
06:09:37.590 --> 06:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
that would increase property taxes due
 
06:09:40.310 --> 06:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
to significantly increased legal extense
 
06:09:44.110 --> 06:09:44.120 align:start position:0%
for for cities and towns therefore uh
 
06:09:46.750 --> 06:09:46.760 align:start position:0%
nhma opposes this bill and I'm open to
 
06:09:49.350 --> 06:09:49.360 align:start position:0%
questions any
 
06:09:52.150 --> 06:09:52.160 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
06:09:54.468 --> 06:09:54.478 align:start position:0%
you is there anyone else that wants to
 
06:09:56.510 --> 06:09:56.520 align:start position:0%
speak on House Bill 614 that hasn't
 
06:09:59.150 --> 06:09:59.160 align:start position:0%
turned the pink card in seeing none I'm
 
06:10:01.350 --> 06:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
going to close the hearing on house
 
06:10:01.360 --> 06:10:02.830 align:start position:0%
going to close the hearing on house
bills

06:10:02.830 --> 06:10:02.840 align:start position:0%
bills
 
06:10:06.150 --> 06:10:06.160 align:start position:0%
614 and that concludes our
 
06:10:08.190 --> 06:10:08.200 align:start position:0%
business thus far I don't know if we
 
06:10:10.468 --> 06:10:10.478 align:start position:0%
want to discuss any more possible
 
06:10:27.548 --> 06:10:27.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:32.030 --> 06:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
but 762 is an early Bill and that is the
 
06:10:34.150 --> 06:10:34.160 align:start position:0%
$30,000 to the judicial branch for the
 
06:10:38.270 --> 06:10:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:04.230 --> 06:11:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:04.240 --> 06:11:34.230 align:start position:0%

06:12:04.160 --> 06:12:34.110 align:start position:0%
 
e

06:12:34.110 --> 06:12:34.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:34.120 --> 06:13:04.110 align:start position:0%
 
e

06:13:04.110 --> 06:13:04.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:04.120 --> 06:13:34.030 align:start position:0%
 
e

06:13:34.030 --> 06:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:32.868 --> 06:14:32.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:34.230 --> 06:14:34.240 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to open up an executive
 
06:14:37.070 --> 06:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
session on house Bill
 
06:14:40.868 --> 06:14:40.878 align:start position:0%

to make a motion uh yes Mr chair um I
 
06:14:50.670 --> 06:14:50.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:53.548 --> 06:14:53.558 align:start position:0%
second representative turer you want to
 
06:14:57.510 --> 06:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion um I would um this
 
06:14:59.548 --> 06:14:59.558 align:start position:0%
bill was originally assigned to
 
06:15:01.670 --> 06:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
Municipal and County and then
 
06:15:03.628 --> 06:15:03.638 align:start position:0%
transferred to
 
06:15:06.430 --> 06:15:06.440 align:start position:0%
Judiciary um it was in the calendar with
 
06:15:10.670 --> 06:15:10.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate notice um there was no
 
06:15:13.830 --> 06:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
sponsor either prime or other sponsor
 
06:15:16.468 --> 06:15:16.478 align:start position:0%
who appeared um a member of the
 
06:15:18.830 --> 06:15:18.840 align:start position:0%

was no written material um submitted uh
 
06:15:29.788 --> 06:15:29.798 align:start position:0%
to the committee and therefore the
 
06:15:32.430 --> 06:15:32.440 align:start position:0%
responsible thing I believe for the
 
06:15:35.270 --> 06:15:35.280 align:start position:0%

bills um I leave to you to decide if
 
06:17:35.030 --> 06:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
that means that they are important to
 
06:17:39.948 --> 06:17:39.958 align:start position:0%
pass or important to defeat but I I
 
06:17:43.868 --> 06:17:43.878 align:start position:0%
