00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
courthouse
 
00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:14.240 align:start position:0%
i was actually very sad when they built
 
00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
the new courthouse because this
 
00:29:18.389 --> 00:29:18.399 align:start position:0%
courthouse is one of the most beautiful
 
00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
um i hope you've had an opportunity to
 
00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:26.789 --> 00:29:26.799 align:start position:0%
the benches that were in these
 
00:29:29.029 --> 00:29:29.039 align:start position:0%
courtrooms were truly beautiful
 
00:29:31.669 --> 00:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
and to remind you that indeed it isn't i
 
00:29:33.269 --> 00:29:33.279 align:start position:0%
probably haven't been in this courthouse
 
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
as an attorney for over 15 years and
 
00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
when i called about it i said is the
 
00:29:40.549 --> 00:29:40.559 align:start position:0%
elevator still the same
 
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
and they say yes you want to take the
 
00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:44.870 align:start position:0%

00:29:56.389 --> 00:29:56.399 align:start position:0%

00:30:51.669 --> 00:30:51.679 align:start position:0%
i've heard leadership dismiss about the

need to have public hands after the

proposed maps are already
 
00:31:00.549 --> 00:31:00.559 align:start position:0%
that is probably the most important
 
00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:06.960 align:start position:0%

obviously you'll be using i see no

reason why
 
00:31:17.669 --> 00:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
several map versions couldn't be made

gerrymandering is a tool that has been

used by political parties to ensure

many people i've spoken with about

redistricting voice to concerns
 
00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
that the process of drawing the maps be
 
00:42:38.309 --> 00:42:38.319 align:start position:0%
done with transparency and public input
 
00:42:40.870 --> 00:42:40.880 align:start position:0%
so i'm glad we're doing this meeting
 
00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
and that the criteria the committee's
 
00:42:46.309 --> 00:42:46.319 align:start position:0%
review clearly stated
 
00:42:48.309 --> 00:42:48.319 align:start position:0%
therefore there are some questions that
 
00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
i hope the committees will address
 
00:42:53.349 --> 00:42:53.359 align:start position:0%
publicly in the coming weeks
 
00:42:55.349 --> 00:42:55.359 align:start position:0%
obviously you'll adhere to the federal
 
00:42:57.430 --> 00:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
and state constitutions about equal
 
00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:59.109 align:start position:0%
and state constitutions about equal
representation

00:42:59.109 --> 00:42:59.119 align:start position:0%
representation
 
00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
but what has your committee decided will
 
00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
be an acceptable deviation from the
 
00:43:05.829 --> 00:43:05.839 align:start position:0%
ideal numbers
 
00:43:09.109 --> 00:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
for each of the four plans when will you
 
00:43:11.589 --> 00:43:11.599 align:start position:0%
make that problem
 
00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
nancy moratio already talked about the
 
00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:16.720 align:start position:0%
uh towns that should have had their own
 
00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:18.069 align:start position:0%
uh towns that should have had their own
reps

00:43:18.069 --> 00:43:18.079 align:start position:0%
reps
 
00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
so i wonder will your committee work to
 
00:43:21.829 --> 00:43:21.839 align:start position:0%
make that happen
 
00:43:23.950 --> 00:43:23.960 align:start position:0%
and where does adhering to that
 
00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:26.720 align:start position:0%
constitutional requirements all in your

00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
communities of interest is a broad term
 
00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
but many are wondering which communities
 
00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
of interest
 
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:37.920 align:start position:0%

when determining which towns should be
 
00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
grouped together
 
00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
have you set those priorities such as
 
00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
keeping regional school districts in the
 
00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
same senate district
 
00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:52.640 align:start position:0%
or grouping neighboring towns that share
 
00:43:55.589 --> 00:43:55.599 align:start position:0%
common problems such as water quality
 
00:43:59.030 --> 00:43:59.040 align:start position:0%

00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
or public health issues
 
00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
if you have not yet
 
00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
prioritized those when do you expect to
 
00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:08.720 align:start position:0%
set those priorities and will you make
 
00:44:12.069 --> 00:44:12.079 align:start position:0%
them public on the committee's website
 
00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:14.480 align:start position:0%

among six senate districts
 
00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
the towns in our county range from my
 
00:44:23.190 --> 00:44:23.200 align:start position:0%
little town on the west to the cities of
 
00:44:25.589 --> 00:44:25.599 align:start position:0%
concord and franklin
 
00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
forming state senate districts it's
 
00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
about the numbers of course but what
 
00:44:33.349 --> 00:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
other demographic aspects will you be
 
00:44:33.359 --> 00:44:36.309 align:start position:0%
other demographic aspects will you be
considering

00:44:36.309 --> 00:44:36.319 align:start position:0%
considering
 
00:44:38.470 --> 00:44:38.480 align:start position:0%
i suggest that until
 
00:44:40.790 --> 00:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
draft maps are drawn and made available
 
00:44:42.069 --> 00:44:42.079 align:start position:0%
to the public
 
00:44:44.790 --> 00:44:44.800 align:start position:0%
it is an exercise and abstraction to
 
00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:46.720 align:start position:0%
discuss what makes sense for any
 
00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
particular town or city
 
00:44:51.109 --> 00:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
therefore i suggest another round of
 
00:44:53.349 --> 00:44:53.359 align:start position:0%
these county input sessions
 
00:44:55.589 --> 00:44:55.599 align:start position:0%
where your actual draft maps will be
 
00:44:57.750 --> 00:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
shown so that you can get specific
 
00:44:57.760 --> 00:44:58.870 align:start position:0%
shown so that you can get specific

from

00:44:59.750 --> 00:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
from

00:45:03.589 --> 00:45:03.599 align:start position:0%
and the public to be heard for your
 
00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
consideration i want to thank you for
 
00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
holding this first round of listening
 
00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
sessions for creating a website where
 
00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
this information will be available and
 
00:45:16.390 --> 00:45:16.400 align:start position:0%

00:45:20.309 --> 00:45:20.319 align:start position:0%
decennial project and i will send email

00:45:59.430 --> 00:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
uh i'm not going to repeat particulars
 
00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
of what other people have said in fact
 
00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
i'm going to try to keep this very
 
00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:05.829 align:start position:0%
i'm going to try to keep this very
straightforward

00:46:05.829 --> 00:46:05.839 align:start position:0%
straightforward
 
00:46:07.109 --> 00:46:07.119 align:start position:0%
and simple
 
00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
um my basic proposition is this
 
00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.349 align:start position:0%
um my basic proposition is this
everybody

00:46:11.349 --> 00:46:11.359 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
deserves an even chance to vote and an
 
00:46:16.150 --> 00:46:16.160 align:start position:0%
eating chance to have his or her voice
 
00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:17.109 align:start position:0%
eating chance to have his or her voice
heard

00:46:17.109 --> 00:46:17.119 align:start position:0%
heard
 
00:46:17.119 --> 00:46:17.910 align:start position:0%
heard
now

00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:20.240 align:start position:0%
everybody in this room knows
 
00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
that we live in a fierce
 
00:46:25.750 --> 00:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
partisan contention
 
00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
maybe generally speaking it's not rough
 
00:46:31.349 --> 00:46:31.359 align:start position:0%
and in some unfortunate instances it's
 
00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
gotten down like this
 
00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
but we can stop that from happening
 
00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
representative smith asked for
 
00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:40.160 align:start position:0%
suggestions so we're going to put one to
 
00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:42.880 align:start position:0%
you it's my personal suggestion i speak
 
00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
for nobody else in this room
 
00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:46.720 align:start position:0%
but here it goes
 
00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
create an independent commission to
 
00:46:51.910 --> 00:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
handle the district
 
00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
as a legislature you can authorize it
 
00:46:56.710 --> 00:46:56.720 align:start position:0%
you retain
 
00:46:58.710 --> 00:46:58.720 align:start position:0%
your authority
 
00:46:58.720 --> 00:46:59.910 align:start position:0%
your authority
over

00:46:59.910 --> 00:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
over
 
00:47:02.150 --> 00:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
redistricting thereby
 
00:47:04.069 --> 00:47:04.079 align:start position:0%
at the same time
 
00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
you ensure
 
00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
an impartial
 
00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
transparent process
 
00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
which increases public trust
 
00:47:14.230 --> 00:47:14.240 align:start position:0%
in our elections the alternative
 
00:47:15.910 --> 00:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
in my view
 
00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:18.640 align:start position:0%
is more wrangling
 
00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
more roughness
 
00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
more gerrymandering
 
00:47:26.630 --> 00:47:26.640 align:start position:0%
more accusations of fraud
 
00:47:28.309 --> 00:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
i could go on and on with the
 
00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
particulars i'm sure you're aware of
 
00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
what people have said on the subject
 
00:47:36.470 --> 00:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
we don't have to travel that road
 
00:47:39.589 --> 00:47:39.599 align:start position:0%
we can stop that code right now
 
00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
so here's what i have to say just do it
 
00:47:43.210 --> 00:47:43.220 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:47:43.220 --> 00:47:47.670 align:start position:0%
thank you

um

00:47:59.980 --> 00:47:59.990 align:start position:0%

00:49:18.150 --> 00:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
and not with you um this is my second
 
00:49:19.829 --> 00:49:19.839 align:start position:0%
go-round this year of the election law
 
00:49:21.589 --> 00:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
i've been on about a number of years and
 
00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
you have some very dedicated public
 
00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:26.640 align:start position:0%
um individuals here who participated in
 
00:49:28.230 --> 00:49:28.240 align:start position:0%
the public process and i've had the
 
00:49:29.990 --> 00:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to spend a lot of time with
 
00:49:32.309 --> 00:49:32.319 align:start position:0%
them in rooms in the legislative office
 
00:49:34.390 --> 00:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
building so it's certainly not out of
 
00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
any disrespect for you if i don't know
 
00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:38.240 align:start position:0%
you and it's out of a lot of respect for
 
00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
the time that the people in this room
 
00:49:42.549 --> 00:49:42.559 align:start position:0%
are financially um in israel
 
00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:53.589 --> 00:49:53.599 align:start position:0%
speaking yes there are actually too many
 
00:49:55.750 --> 00:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
hearings put on our
 
00:49:58.309 --> 00:49:58.319 align:start position:0%
listening sessions going on at this time
 
00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:00.640 align:start position:0%
the senate rules would say that you need
 
00:50:02.069 --> 00:50:02.079 align:start position:0%
to repeat
 
00:50:03.109 --> 00:50:03.119 align:start position:0%
not to
 
00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
do a whole bunch of things okay
 
00:50:07.589 --> 00:50:07.599 align:start position:0%
try to keep it concise
 
00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
etc so
 
00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
you know if
 
00:50:12.870 --> 00:50:12.880 align:start position:0%
he doesn't go on too long or about
 
00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:13.910 align:start position:0%
he doesn't go on too long or about
something

00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:50:17.190 --> 00:50:17.200 align:start position:0%
uh i am in the sense i will object
 
00:50:19.910 --> 00:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
and try to get someone else to
 
00:50:26.540 --> 00:50:26.550 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:26.550 --> 00:50:29.349 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:50:29.349 --> 00:50:29.359 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
um and just so
 
00:50:34.230 --> 00:50:34.240 align:start position:0%
i had received word that someone else
 
00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
was going to be here to was the director
 
00:50:51.670 --> 00:50:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:06.069 --> 00:51:06.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:08.230 --> 00:51:08.240 align:start position:0%
which is a non-partisan organization
 
00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
that hosts redistricting data um
 
00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:12.630 align:start position:0%
that hosts redistricting data um
nationally

00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:12.640 align:start position:0%
nationally
 
00:51:16.549 --> 00:51:16.559 align:start position:0%
i also volunteer with open democracy
 
00:51:31.990 --> 00:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
to say that redistricting is the
 
00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
foundation of a democracy and if we um
 
00:51:39.349 --> 00:51:39.359 align:start position:0%
break that foundation with
 
00:51:39.359 --> 00:51:40.950 align:start position:0%
break that foundation with
gerrymandering

00:51:40.950 --> 00:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
gerrymandering
 
00:51:43.510 --> 00:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
seriously our democracy as we
 
00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
are seeing um in the past
 
00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:51.589 --> 00:51:51.599 align:start position:0%
so the first to get into uh some of the
 
00:51:53.190 --> 00:51:53.200 align:start position:0%
maps um
 
00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
first congressionally uh i would ask
 
00:51:57.990 --> 00:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
that you try to keep the
 
00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
current congressional districts as uh
 
00:52:04.069 --> 00:52:04.079 align:start position:0%
they are pretty considered to be very
 
00:52:04.079 --> 00:52:04.950 align:start position:0%
they are pretty considered to be very
fair

00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
fair
 
00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:10.950 --> 00:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
they have a lot of rural and they both
 
00:52:13.109 --> 00:52:13.119 align:start position:0%
have a lot of urban so they're very well
 
00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
put together
 
00:52:16.309 --> 00:52:16.319 align:start position:0%
there is some
 
00:52:18.150 --> 00:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
changes that could be made to enhance
 
00:52:19.829 --> 00:52:19.839 align:start position:0%
those maps but i would think that the
 
00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:21.440 align:start position:0%
cores of those maps should be kept
 
00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
together in that um
 
00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
they're actually very they're considered
 
00:52:28.390 --> 00:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
to be very uh very good uh
 
00:52:30.829 --> 00:52:30.839 align:start position:0%
districts for both
 
00:52:34.390 --> 00:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
parties uh then moving on to the
 
00:52:36.790 --> 00:52:36.800 align:start position:0%
executive council um i feel that the
 
00:52:38.790 --> 00:52:38.800 align:start position:0%
executive council map should be
 
00:52:42.150 --> 00:52:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:44.640 align:start position:0%
from the current districts and district
 
00:52:48.150 --> 00:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:51.190 --> 00:52:51.200 align:start position:0%
we should first start with um
 
00:52:53.109 --> 00:52:53.119 align:start position:0%
almost like a regional approach approach
 
00:52:56.390 --> 00:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
to the executive council seeing as we
 
00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:58.230 align:start position:0%
to the executive council seeing as we
have

00:52:58.230 --> 00:52:58.240 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:52:59.510 --> 00:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
kind of specific regions in new
 
00:53:00.790 --> 00:53:00.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire we have the north country we
 
00:53:02.710 --> 00:53:02.720 align:start position:0%
have the lake street we have western new
 
00:53:04.950 --> 00:53:04.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire we have the sea coast
 
00:53:06.549 --> 00:53:06.559 align:start position:0%
and then we have southern new hampshire
 
00:53:09.589 --> 00:53:09.599 align:start position:0%
if we can break those uh start with
 
00:53:11.190 --> 00:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
those different
 
00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:14.640 align:start position:0%
areas with our executive council mass
 
00:53:17.430 --> 00:53:17.440 align:start position:0%
we can get a better
 
00:53:21.109 --> 00:53:21.119 align:start position:0%
representation of those areas um
 
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
and then concerning all of the different
 
00:53:25.349 --> 00:53:25.359 align:start position:0%
maps i would uh
 
00:53:27.349 --> 00:53:27.359 align:start position:0%
like to repeat that communities of
 
00:53:29.589 --> 00:53:29.599 align:start position:0%
interest are very important and
 
00:53:30.870 --> 00:53:30.880 align:start position:0%
they should be
 
00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:32.640 align:start position:0%
preserved as
 
00:53:34.069 --> 00:53:34.079 align:start position:0%
much as possible
 
00:53:36.549 --> 00:53:36.559 align:start position:0%
for instance sauss
 
00:53:38.069 --> 00:53:38.079 align:start position:0%
public health
 
00:53:39.190 --> 00:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
those should be
 
00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:41.680 align:start position:0%
kept together if possible i know
 
00:53:43.750 --> 00:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
i've done a lot of mapping and i know
 
00:53:46.150 --> 00:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
the map is difficult in some areas but
 
00:53:48.309 --> 00:53:48.319 align:start position:0%
it is possible to
 
00:53:49.510 --> 00:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
you you're not going to have the perfect
 
00:53:51.190 --> 00:53:51.200 align:start position:0%
map but you can strive for the perfect
 
00:53:52.790 --> 00:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
map um
 
00:53:56.390 --> 00:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
and so uh i guess then moving on to the
 
00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:57.750 align:start position:0%
and so uh i guess then moving on to the
senate

00:53:57.750 --> 00:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
senate
 
00:54:01.829 --> 00:54:01.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:03.589 --> 00:54:03.599 align:start position:0%
i would consider not a very good map in
 
00:54:04.630 --> 00:54:04.640 align:start position:0%
that it
 
00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:06.150 align:start position:0%
that it
is

00:54:06.150 --> 00:54:06.160 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
very there's a lot of different
 
00:54:10.230 --> 00:54:10.240 align:start position:0%
sprawling uh districts i would ask the
 
00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
committee to
 
00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:12.710 align:start position:0%
committee to
keep

00:54:12.710 --> 00:54:12.720 align:start position:0%
keep
 
00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
maybe when you're setting your criteria
 
00:54:17.430 --> 00:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
to include compactness in those criteria
 
00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
for the senate maps specifically
 
00:54:22.710 --> 00:54:22.720 align:start position:0%
and i think that that could help
 
00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
keep more communities of interest
 
00:54:26.069 --> 00:54:26.079 align:start position:0%
together and we
 
00:54:28.230 --> 00:54:28.240 align:start position:0%
include compactness as a
 
00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:29.829 align:start position:0%
include compactness as a
criteria

00:54:29.829 --> 00:54:29.839 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
00:54:29.839 --> 00:54:31.270 align:start position:0%
criteria
um

00:54:31.270 --> 00:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:32.230 --> 00:54:32.240 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:54:33.829 --> 00:54:33.839 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:54:35.829 --> 00:54:35.839 align:start position:0%
house map
 
00:54:38.309 --> 00:54:38.319 align:start position:0%
this is where the kind of core of my uh
 
00:54:38.319 --> 00:54:39.109 align:start position:0%
this is where the kind of core of my uh
uh

00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:39.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:54:41.829 --> 00:54:41.839 align:start position:0%
speech is coming in um
 
00:54:41.839 --> 00:54:42.870 align:start position:0%
speech is coming in um
so

00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:42.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:54:44.630 --> 00:54:44.640 align:start position:0%
i want to talk about the methodology in
 
00:54:46.309 --> 00:54:46.319 align:start position:0%
calculating the
 
00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
districts for the house um a little bit
 
00:54:53.430 --> 00:54:53.440 align:start position:0%
of history on it in 2000 the house maps
 
00:54:55.750 --> 00:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
were drawn and they were drawn using the
 
00:54:58.230 --> 00:54:58.240 align:start position:0%
aggregate method um which is kind of
 
00:55:00.789 --> 00:55:00.799 align:start position:0%
what everyone thinks the floaterial is
 
00:55:03.829 --> 00:55:03.839 align:start position:0%
you kind of take two districts
 
00:55:05.349 --> 00:55:05.359 align:start position:0%
and then there's a leftover population
 
00:55:06.549 --> 00:55:06.559 align:start position:0%
from those districts you put them
 
00:55:09.270 --> 00:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
together and you get a material
 
00:55:11.190 --> 00:55:11.200 align:start position:0%
out of those leftover people which is
 
00:55:13.030 --> 00:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
what is generally considered
 
00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:13.829 align:start position:0%
what is generally considered
uh

00:55:13.829 --> 00:55:13.839 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:55:16.630 --> 00:55:16.640 align:start position:0%
what i think whatever they think of as
 
00:55:18.829 --> 00:55:18.839 align:start position:0%
but in actuality in
 
00:55:21.190 --> 00:55:21.200 align:start position:0%
2002 uh the maps were challenging the
 
00:55:23.829 --> 00:55:23.839 align:start position:0%
court and the supreme court ruled that
 
00:55:26.950 --> 00:55:26.960 align:start position:0%
the aggregate method was not a valid
 
00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
method in creating materials
 
00:55:31.589 --> 00:55:31.599 align:start position:0%
because of the fact that you could say
 
00:55:31.599 --> 00:55:32.950 align:start position:0%
because of the fact that you could say
have

00:55:32.950 --> 00:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
two districts one district had say 50
 
00:55:37.349 --> 00:55:37.359 align:start position:0%
extra people and one district had three
 
00:55:37.359 --> 00:55:38.630 align:start position:0%
extra people and one district had three
thousand

00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:38.640 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
00:55:40.789 --> 00:55:40.799 align:start position:0%
three hundred and fifty extra people
 
00:55:42.549 --> 00:55:42.559 align:start position:0%
and then you could create a material out
 
00:55:44.870 --> 00:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
of that using the agriculture
 
00:55:50.230 --> 00:55:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:52.150 --> 00:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
uh that that was unconstitutional based
 
00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
on the one person one vote
 
00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
and so that
 
00:55:57.910 --> 00:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
floaters should therefore
 
00:56:00.870 --> 00:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
consist of around the same amount of
 
00:56:02.470 --> 00:56:02.480 align:start position:0%
people so for instance
 
00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:03.349 align:start position:0%
people so for instance
uh

00:56:03.349 --> 00:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
if a district if districts were three
 
00:56:07.670 --> 00:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
thousand people you should have about
 
00:56:09.990 --> 00:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
fifteen hundred from each district would
 
00:56:13.109 --> 00:56:13.119 align:start position:0%
comprise your district and therefore
 
00:56:15.430 --> 00:56:15.440 align:start position:0%
it would
 
00:56:18.230 --> 00:56:18.240 align:start position:0%
in um with the one person one vote
 
00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:19.270 align:start position:0%
in um with the one person one vote
um

00:56:19.270 --> 00:56:19.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:21.589 --> 00:56:21.599 align:start position:0%
and so what they put forth is what is
 
00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:33.510 --> 00:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
and in that what it does is it
 
00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:38.950 align:start position:0%
and in that what it does is it
assigns

00:56:38.950 --> 00:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
assigns
 
00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:40.640 align:start position:0%
the ideal population to the
 
00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:42.150 align:start position:0%
the ideal population to the
non-coaterial

00:56:42.150 --> 00:56:42.160 align:start position:0%
non-coaterial
 
00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:43.270 align:start position:0%
non-coaterial
districts

00:56:43.270 --> 00:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:56:46.470 --> 00:56:46.480 align:start position:0%
it takes the leftover population and
 
00:56:48.549 --> 00:56:48.559 align:start position:0%
then pretty much tries to make sure that
 
00:56:51.589 --> 00:56:51.599 align:start position:0%
those align given a certain deviation
 
00:56:51.599 --> 00:56:54.630 align:start position:0%
those align given a certain deviation
um

00:56:54.630 --> 00:56:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:56.950 --> 00:56:56.960 align:start position:0%
i have uh
 
00:56:59.510 --> 00:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh come up with a
 
00:57:01.109 --> 00:57:01.119 align:start position:0%
different methodology
 
00:57:03.910 --> 00:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
slightly um because the component is
 
00:57:05.670 --> 00:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
very uh
 
00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:09.680 align:start position:0%
it really limits the um
 
00:57:12.069 --> 00:57:12.079 align:start position:0%
the amount of uh districts that can
 
00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
actually use the floater so for instance
 
00:57:16.950 --> 00:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
hudson and pelham currently are in the
 
00:57:19.270 --> 00:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
same district they could not be broken
 
00:57:22.309 --> 00:57:22.319 align:start position:0%
up into two different districts and with
 
00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
a floaterial rep
 
00:57:25.589 --> 00:57:25.599 align:start position:0%
because they would not align with the
 
00:57:27.270 --> 00:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
component at that time
 
00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:29.190 align:start position:0%
component at that time
um

00:57:29.190 --> 00:57:29.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:31.750 --> 00:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
there's a number of other different uh
 
00:57:34.789 --> 00:57:34.799 align:start position:0%
instances where this is the case and
 
00:57:34.799 --> 00:57:35.510 align:start position:0%
instances where this is the case and
so

00:57:35.510 --> 00:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:57:38.150 --> 00:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
given that in 2006 the
 
00:57:40.390 --> 00:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
numerator constitution has changed to
 
00:57:41.910 --> 00:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
give each
 
00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
town that has a sufficient population
 
00:57:46.710 --> 00:57:46.720 align:start position:0%
their own district um i think that it is
 
00:57:47.829 --> 00:57:47.839 align:start position:0%
worth looking into different
 
00:57:50.390 --> 00:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
methodologies um in calculating
 
00:57:53.589 --> 00:57:53.599 align:start position:0%
materials to allow for more
 
00:57:57.270 --> 00:57:57.280 align:start position:0%
towns have their own representatives
 
00:57:59.670 --> 00:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
what i come up with is
 
00:58:01.510 --> 00:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
what i call the alternative component
 
00:58:03.349 --> 00:58:03.359 align:start position:0%
method which is pretty much the same
 
00:58:03.359 --> 00:58:04.950 align:start position:0%
method which is pretty much the same
thing

00:58:04.950 --> 00:58:04.960 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:58:06.870 --> 00:58:06.880 align:start position:0%
as the component method
 
00:58:09.349 --> 00:58:09.359 align:start position:0%
but what it does is it takes into
 
00:58:09.359 --> 00:58:10.309 align:start position:0%
but what it does is it takes into
account

00:58:10.309 --> 00:58:10.319 align:start position:0%
account
 
00:58:13.829 --> 00:58:13.839 align:start position:0%
the deviations of the non-clotarial
 
00:58:13.839 --> 00:58:14.630 align:start position:0%
the deviations of the non-clotarial
uh

00:58:14.630 --> 00:58:14.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:58:18.549 --> 00:58:18.559 align:start position:0%
reps so for instance um
 
00:58:21.670 --> 00:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
i sent the house committee a memo that
 
00:58:24.549 --> 00:58:24.559 align:start position:0%
kind of outlines this uh more
 
00:58:24.559 --> 00:58:25.670 align:start position:0%
kind of outlines this uh more
clearly

00:58:25.670 --> 00:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
clearly
 
00:58:28.470 --> 00:58:28.480 align:start position:0%
it's a little difficult to
 
00:58:31.109 --> 00:58:31.119 align:start position:0%
explain without a without a whiteboard
 
00:58:33.109 --> 00:58:33.119 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:58:36.069 --> 00:58:36.079 align:start position:0%
but so for instance if uh say we have a
 
00:58:38.950 --> 00:58:38.960 align:start position:0%
district say the ideal population for uh
 
00:58:41.430 --> 00:58:41.440 align:start position:0%
house rep was three thousand feet um say
 
00:58:42.870 --> 00:58:42.880 align:start position:0%
we have a district of four thousand
 
00:58:44.710 --> 00:58:44.720 align:start position:0%
people and a district of five thousand
 
00:58:47.109 --> 00:58:47.119 align:start position:0%
people um
 
00:58:48.230 --> 00:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
you would have
 
00:58:49.670 --> 00:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
the phone amendment would assign three
 
00:58:51.030 --> 00:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
thousand people
 
00:58:52.789 --> 00:58:52.799 align:start position:0%
in one district a house crowd three
 
00:58:54.230 --> 00:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
thousand people in the other district
 
00:58:55.430 --> 00:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
house and then there would be two
 
00:58:56.789 --> 00:58:56.799 align:start position:0%
thousand people left over in one
 
00:58:58.470 --> 00:58:58.480 align:start position:0%
district and one thousand people left
 
00:59:00.069 --> 00:59:00.079 align:start position:0%
over in the other district
 
00:59:02.549 --> 00:59:02.559 align:start position:0%
the component method calculates this and
 
00:59:04.230 --> 00:59:04.240 align:start position:0%
says that there's a difference one
 
00:59:06.150 --> 00:59:06.160 align:start position:0%
thousand people in that literal district
 
00:59:08.150 --> 00:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
and therefore it's not allowed it's too
 
00:59:10.390 --> 00:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
much it's too big of a dis too big of a
 
00:59:12.150 --> 00:59:12.160 align:start position:0%
difference to allow
 
00:59:14.390 --> 00:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
but what it doesn't calculate is that
 
00:59:16.549 --> 00:59:16.559 align:start position:0%
there's a variation in those
 
00:59:16.559 --> 00:59:18.150 align:start position:0%
there's a variation in those
non-coaterial

00:59:18.150 --> 00:59:18.160 align:start position:0%
non-coaterial
 
00:59:20.630 --> 00:59:20.640 align:start position:0%
so for instance in the town that has
 
00:59:23.030 --> 00:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
in the district that has 4000 people
 
00:59:24.549 --> 00:59:24.559 align:start position:0%
you could assign
 
00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
um between
 
00:59:28.710 --> 00:59:28.720 align:start position:0%
three you could assign 3 000 people plus
 
00:59:30.870 --> 00:59:30.880 align:start position:0%
or minus 5 so there's still an extra
 
00:59:33.750 --> 00:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
deviation there so what you could do is
 
00:59:36.950 --> 00:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
assign 2 850 people and then it would
 
00:59:40.470 --> 00:59:40.480 align:start position:0%
provide 1 250 people to the plateau rep
 
00:59:42.390 --> 00:59:42.400 align:start position:0%
and then with the
 
00:59:44.470 --> 00:59:44.480 align:start position:0%
district with 5000 people you would
 
00:59:47.510 --> 00:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
assign you could assign 3 150 people for
 
00:59:49.829 --> 00:59:49.839 align:start position:0%
the nonprofit rep and they would they
 
00:59:52.230 --> 00:59:52.240 align:start position:0%
would give 1
 
00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:53.750 align:start position:0%
would give 1
850

00:59:53.750 --> 00:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
850
 
00:59:56.470 --> 00:59:56.480 align:start position:0%
and therefore you're off by only
 
00:59:59.430 --> 00:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
700 instead of a thousand and that would
 
01:00:01.030 --> 01:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
that difference is actually close enough
 
01:00:03.589 --> 01:00:03.599 align:start position:0%
to allow for a floater
 
01:00:05.670 --> 01:00:05.680 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
what the alternate method alternate
 
01:00:09.670 --> 01:00:09.680 align:start position:0%
important method really does is it
 
01:00:13.030 --> 01:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
allows flexibility in the different
 
01:00:15.670 --> 01:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
in the mapping of the house districts um
 
01:00:18.390 --> 01:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
for instance um i know uh representative
 
01:00:21.510 --> 01:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
mcguire is in a plateau with uh
 
01:00:25.510 --> 01:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
epsom pittsfield and downstone
 
01:00:29.349 --> 01:00:29.359 align:start position:0%
and with the current populations the uh
 
01:00:30.950 --> 01:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
founds town if
 
01:00:33.349 --> 01:00:33.359 align:start position:0%
that same district was kept together the
 
01:00:35.589 --> 01:00:35.599 align:start position:0%
component method would not allow for out
 
01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
for epsom and pittsfield to have their
 
01:00:40.390 --> 01:00:40.400 align:start position:0%
own press um so
 
01:00:41.910 --> 01:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh pittsfield and epsom would be kept
 
01:00:44.470 --> 01:00:44.480 align:start position:0%
together and then allentown could have
 
01:00:46.150 --> 01:00:46.160 align:start position:0%
its own red but with the alternative
 
01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
performance he gives it just a little
 
01:00:50.309 --> 01:00:50.319 align:start position:0%
bit of flexibility and then that would
 
01:00:53.670 --> 01:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
allow for um pittsfield to have its own
 
01:00:59.190 --> 01:00:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:05.430 align:start position:0%

01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:07.430 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:01:09.270 --> 01:01:09.280 align:start position:0%
in keeping with the same
 
01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:11.270 align:start position:0%
in keeping with the same
um

01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:13.510 --> 01:01:13.520 align:start position:0%
spirit of the supreme court ruling in
 
01:01:15.510 --> 01:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
that you can't have
 
01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
three thousand people assigned to one
 
01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
and fifty from another but it actually
 
01:01:23.750 --> 01:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh gets just a slightly bit more uh
 
01:01:26.390 --> 01:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
flexibility so for instance um the the
 
01:01:28.630 --> 01:01:28.640 align:start position:0%
best possible uh
 
01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
house map that that we could come up
 
01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
with for merrimack had six violations um
 
01:01:37.990 --> 01:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
for the current 2020
 
01:01:41.430 --> 01:01:41.440 align:start position:0%
mapping um in 2010 there was 11 uh
 
01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
violations of
 
01:01:45.510 --> 01:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
towns that had this mission population
 
01:01:49.109 --> 01:01:49.119 align:start position:0%
that did not get their own prep um
 
01:01:49.119 --> 01:01:49.990 align:start position:0%
that did not get their own prep um
so

01:01:49.990 --> 01:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:50.829 align:start position:0%
so
uh

01:01:50.829 --> 01:01:50.839 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
with the alternative component method
 
01:01:54.789 --> 01:01:54.799 align:start position:0%
you could actually get that out of two
 
01:01:56.710 --> 01:01:56.720 align:start position:0%
so instead of six violations of the best
 
01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:57.670 align:start position:0%
so instead of six violations of the best
possible

01:01:57.670 --> 01:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
possible
 
01:01:59.910 --> 01:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
method you get it down to two and those
 
01:02:02.549 --> 01:02:02.559 align:start position:0%
two are actually um
 
01:02:04.870 --> 01:02:04.880 align:start position:0%
one of the faults of my town in texas
 
01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:16.549 align:start position:0%
one of the faults of my town in texas
and

01:02:16.549 --> 01:02:16.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:18.710 --> 01:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
so we need to be combined with one of
 
01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
them and so we violate the constitution
 
01:02:25.670 --> 01:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
luckily canterbury is also one so we
 
01:02:28.150 --> 01:02:28.160 align:start position:0%
could uh combine those with loudoun and
 
01:02:30.789 --> 01:02:30.799 align:start position:0%
that would only lead to one violation um
 
01:02:32.789 --> 01:02:32.799 align:start position:0%
the other violation the other town that
 
01:02:37.190 --> 01:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:38.710 align:start position:0%

so that they all have their own

um representation
 
01:02:53.829 --> 01:02:53.839 align:start position:0%
and in keeping with the constitution and
 
01:02:56.549 --> 01:02:56.559 align:start position:0%
i believe it would
 
01:02:58.710 --> 01:02:58.720 align:start position:0%
keep in line with what the supreme court
 
01:03:10.710 --> 01:03:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:12.340 align:start position:0%

um as we've talked about a little bit
 
01:04:44.230 --> 01:04:44.240 align:start position:0%
tonight it's really important that the
 
01:04:47.670 --> 01:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
criteria is um publicly available so we
 
01:04:49.510 --> 01:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
know how you are going to select
 
01:04:51.510 --> 01:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
districts for county lines to be
 
01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:54.950 align:start position:0%
districts for county lines to be
followed

01:04:58.789 --> 01:04:58.799 align:start position:0%
will we follow the constitution the 2006
 
01:05:00.309 --> 01:05:00.319 align:start position:0%
amendment where towns with a large
 
01:05:01.750 --> 01:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
enough population
 
01:05:03.430 --> 01:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
um stay together
 
01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:05.200 align:start position:0%
what communities of interest will you
 
01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:06.150 align:start position:0%
what communities of interest will you
select

01:05:06.150 --> 01:05:06.160 align:start position:0%
select
 
01:05:08.230 --> 01:05:08.240 align:start position:0%
school district would be one that i
 
01:05:10.470 --> 01:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
think is really important and um the
 
01:05:12.549 --> 01:05:12.559 align:start position:0%
open democracy mapping team has created
 
01:05:14.789 --> 01:05:14.799 align:start position:0%
with the department of um
 
01:05:17.029 --> 01:05:17.039 align:start position:0%
education an overlay that you can
 
01:05:17.039 --> 01:05:18.549 align:start position:0%
education an overlay that you can
overlay

01:05:18.549 --> 01:05:18.559 align:start position:0%
overlay
 
01:05:21.029 --> 01:05:21.039 align:start position:0%
the school districts and so there is a
 
01:05:22.390 --> 01:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
tool available
 
01:05:24.309 --> 01:05:24.319 align:start position:0%
um to overlay school districts if you
 
01:05:25.990 --> 01:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
want to see which maps across school
 
01:05:27.990 --> 01:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
districts the other communities of
 
01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.029 align:start position:0%
districts the other communities of
interest

01:05:29.029 --> 01:05:29.039 align:start position:0%
interest
 
01:05:30.470 --> 01:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
that's really important is a lot of
 
01:05:32.309 --> 01:05:32.319 align:start position:0%
communities share police and fire
 
01:05:32.319 --> 01:05:33.510 align:start position:0%
communities share police and fire
services

01:05:33.510 --> 01:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:05:36.549 --> 01:05:36.559 align:start position:0%
and and oftentimes those are separated
 
01:05:39.589 --> 01:05:39.599 align:start position:0%
so for one example um in this city of
 
01:05:41.589 --> 01:05:41.599 align:start position:0%
franklin the city of franklin ward 3 is
 
01:05:43.270 --> 01:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
connected with north
 
01:05:45.029 --> 01:05:45.039 align:start position:0%
north they share a state representative
 
01:05:46.710 --> 01:05:46.720 align:start position:0%
northfield is large enough to have their
 
01:05:48.870 --> 01:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
own state under the constitution
 
01:05:51.670 --> 01:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
northfield shares a police station with
 
01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:53.190 align:start position:0%
northfield shares a police station with
tilton

01:05:53.190 --> 01:05:53.200 align:start position:0%
tilton
 
01:05:54.549 --> 01:05:54.559 align:start position:0%
northfield can be combined because
 
01:05:55.990 --> 01:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
they're in different counties get that
 
01:05:58.309 --> 01:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
for the house maps but i think we need
 
01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
to sort of think about
 
01:06:02.829 --> 01:06:02.839 align:start position:0%
those districts i do want to bring up
 
01:06:05.430 --> 01:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
another problem that i think
 
01:06:07.910 --> 01:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
is just a timing problem with the census
 
01:06:10.950 --> 01:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
delay this year is the city of franklin
 
01:06:13.829 --> 01:06:13.839 align:start position:0%
has to change our chart to change
 
01:06:15.990 --> 01:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
the population for 2020
 
01:06:17.910 --> 01:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
is not an even population in the city of
 
01:06:19.910 --> 01:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
franklin so the three ward lines will
 
01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
need to be adjusted
 
01:06:23.270 --> 01:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
our elections are october the first
 
01:06:25.589 --> 01:06:25.599 align:start position:0%
tuesday of october so this
 
01:06:29.670 --> 01:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
tuesday october 5th there will not be a
 
01:06:31.829 --> 01:06:31.839 align:start position:0%
charter amendment
 
01:06:33.910 --> 01:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
won't happen until
 
01:06:36.390 --> 01:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
2022 where a charter amendment is
 
01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:37.349 align:start position:0%
2022 where a charter amendment is
brought

01:06:37.349 --> 01:06:37.359 align:start position:0%
brought
 
01:06:39.510 --> 01:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
i know that it's after this committee
 
01:06:42.630 --> 01:06:42.640 align:start position:0%
has done their work so in its instances
 
01:06:44.549 --> 01:06:44.559 align:start position:0%
like the city of franklin it would be
 
01:06:46.470 --> 01:06:46.480 align:start position:0%
really great if you keep the city of
 
01:06:48.150 --> 01:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
franklin together
 
01:06:50.309 --> 01:06:50.319 align:start position:0%
as much as possible right now the city
 
01:06:51.829 --> 01:06:51.839 align:start position:0%
of franklin works one and two are
 
01:06:53.589 --> 01:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
divided with hill for
 
01:06:54.950 --> 01:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
two state reps
 
01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:55.990 align:start position:0%
two state reps
and

01:06:55.990 --> 01:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:06:58.470 --> 01:06:58.480 align:start position:0%
ward three and northfield are two state
 
01:07:00.069 --> 01:07:00.079 align:start position:0%
reps and then there's a larger float
 
01:07:02.069 --> 01:07:02.079 align:start position:0%
area which is we have a representative
 
01:07:04.150 --> 01:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
from loudoun that represents the
 
01:07:06.630 --> 01:07:06.640 align:start position:0%
district there so as long as you can try
 
01:07:09.510 --> 01:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
to try to keep all three works together
 
01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:10.630 align:start position:0%
to try to keep all three works together
um

01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:10.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:13.190 --> 01:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
when the city does our work changing
 
01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:14.390 align:start position:0%
when the city does our work changing
charter

01:07:14.390 --> 01:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
charter
 
01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:15.109 align:start position:0%
charter
the

01:07:15.109 --> 01:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:07:15.119 --> 01:07:16.630 align:start position:0%
the
lines

01:07:16.630 --> 01:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
lines
 
01:07:18.390 --> 01:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
will not be thrown off too much because
 
01:07:20.309 --> 01:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
right now your math is
 
01:07:20.319 --> 01:07:21.349 align:start position:0%
right now your math is
um

01:07:21.349 --> 01:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:23.910 --> 01:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
word three is our largest board in our
 
01:07:27.029 --> 01:07:27.039 align:start position:0%
city with the 2020 numbers and the city
 
01:07:28.390 --> 01:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
of franklin's charter has not been
 
01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:30.870 align:start position:0%
of franklin's charter has not been
amended

01:07:30.870 --> 01:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:33.750 --> 01:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
because the last two redistricting
 
01:07:35.430 --> 01:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
we haven't seen growth
 
01:07:38.870 --> 01:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
um and this this time our reports do
 
01:07:41.190 --> 01:07:41.200 align:start position:0%
uh require changing
 
01:07:43.589 --> 01:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
so that is another thing to look at the
 
01:07:45.670 --> 01:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
process of how you
 
01:07:47.750 --> 01:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
know you have to do your work and meet a
 
01:07:50.630 --> 01:07:50.640 align:start position:0%
deadline um and study charters
 
01:07:52.870 --> 01:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
in some instances in the instance of
 
01:07:54.549 --> 01:07:54.559 align:start position:0%
frankly will not be done
 
01:07:56.150 --> 01:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
before the work of this committee is
 
01:07:58.789 --> 01:07:58.799 align:start position:0%
done so figuring out how you
 
01:08:01.190 --> 01:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
reconcile those differences it would be
 
01:08:02.950 --> 01:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
good to
 
01:08:05.349 --> 01:08:05.359 align:start position:0%
reconcile those differences and
 
01:08:07.670 --> 01:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
and get input from from leaders in those
 
01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:08.789 align:start position:0%
and get input from from leaders in those
communities

01:08:08.789 --> 01:08:08.799 align:start position:0%
communities
 
01:08:08.799 --> 01:08:15.510 align:start position:0%
communities
on

01:08:15.510 --> 01:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
so i want to thank you again for for
 
01:08:20.470 --> 01:08:20.480 align:start position:0%
this process um
 
01:08:22.070 --> 01:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
i do want to touch a little bit on the
 
01:08:24.630 --> 01:08:24.640 align:start position:0%
executive council line i know the city
 
01:08:26.309 --> 01:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
of franklin is the northern part of that
 
01:08:28.470 --> 01:08:28.480 align:start position:0%
executive council district we've lost
 
01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:29.829 align:start position:0%
executive council district we've lost
population

01:08:29.829 --> 01:08:29.839 align:start position:0%
population
 
01:08:37.990 --> 01:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:40.960 align:start position:0%
stay in a dragon shaped form but i think
 
01:08:42.550 --> 01:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
as you look at the effects of council
 
01:08:45.910 --> 01:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
maps it would be really good to keep the
 
01:08:49.269 --> 01:08:49.279 align:start position:0%
criteria of compactness
 
01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
and also
 
01:08:53.110 --> 01:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
you can't get there from here in some
 
01:08:55.749 --> 01:08:55.759 align:start position:0%
square towns you have to drive out of a
 
01:08:55.759 --> 01:08:57.269 align:start position:0%
square towns you have to drive out of a
community

01:08:57.269 --> 01:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:08:59.189 --> 01:08:59.199 align:start position:0%
several miles outside of the community
 
01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
to get somewhere so you should also look
 
01:09:03.590 --> 01:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
at the major east-west highways that we
 
01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:04.630 align:start position:0%
at the major east-west highways that we
have

01:09:04.630 --> 01:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:09:06.309 --> 01:09:06.319 align:start position:0%
because sometimes you just stink it from
 
01:09:08.070 --> 01:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
one town to another even though they're
 
01:09:10.550 --> 01:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
next to each other so um those
 
01:09:12.870 --> 01:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
geographical differences should be done
 
01:09:15.030 --> 01:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
carefully and driving those steps
 
01:09:17.110 --> 01:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
um i will talk about the
 
01:09:18.870 --> 01:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
professional district maps that will be
 
01:09:20.630 --> 01:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
drawn i do think
 
01:09:22.309 --> 01:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
to have a population
 
01:09:26.149 --> 01:09:26.159 align:start position:0%
deviation of core from left side is
 
01:09:28.070 --> 01:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
remarkable that you've got pretty equal
 
01:09:30.309 --> 01:09:30.319 align:start position:0%
population in those two districts and so
 
01:09:32.390 --> 01:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
to keep as much equal population as
 
01:09:35.030 --> 01:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
possible but to try not to split county
 
01:09:37.349 --> 01:09:37.359 align:start position:0%
lines i think hampton is an example
 
01:09:37.359 --> 01:09:38.550 align:start position:0%
lines i think hampton is an example
where

01:09:38.550 --> 01:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:09:40.309 --> 01:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
is the only community that's not in a
 
01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
county line and not just in
 
01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
congressional maps so it will be good to
 
01:09:47.430 --> 01:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
look at trying to keep
 
01:09:49.269 --> 01:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
the existing map
 
01:09:50.789 --> 01:09:50.799 align:start position:0%
i will say that
 
01:09:53.030 --> 01:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
the congressional maps are probably the
 
01:09:55.030 --> 01:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
only maps you should do that with
 
01:09:57.830 --> 01:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
the other maps trying to look at how the
 
01:10:00.070 --> 01:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
gerrymandering was done 10 years ago and
 
01:10:02.470 --> 01:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
say oh let's try to do something similar
 
01:10:05.590 --> 01:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
without reconciling that
 
01:10:07.590 --> 01:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
the districts were skewed
 
01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
maybe a lot of process might be better
 
01:10:12.070 --> 01:10:12.080 align:start position:0%
to sort of start from scratch in some of
 
01:10:14.830 --> 01:10:14.840 align:start position:0%
the instances where we know existing
 
01:10:18.950 --> 01:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:34.229 --> 01:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:34.239 --> 01:10:54.700 align:start position:0%
 
oh

01:10:54.700 --> 01:10:54.710 align:start position:0%

you know democratic

leaning districts uh more than
 
01:12:50.709 --> 01:12:50.719 align:start position:0%
republican or independent ones
 
01:12:52.229 --> 01:12:52.239 align:start position:0%
but i
 
01:12:54.790 --> 01:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
asked myself as a lawmaker
 
01:12:57.270 --> 01:12:57.280 align:start position:0%
what's the best thing for grand speakers
 
01:12:59.990 --> 01:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh it isn't my part bipartisan my
 
01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
partisan is

very much the live streaming and
