00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 align:start position:0%
America and to the Republic for which it
 
00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 align:start position:0%
stands one nation under God indivisible
 
00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for all of you for
 
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 align:start position:0%
coming I appreciate it it's on a Friday
 
00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 align:start position:0%
we're going to as as representative
 
00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 align:start position:0%
Sullivan knows I like to have
 
00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 align:start position:0%
free-flowing discussions whenever
 
00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
possible especially in a situation where
 
00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 align:start position:0%
we're talking about retained bills
 
00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
so uh we'll obviously be less formal uh
 
00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 align:start position:0%
speak as you feel free we can have it
 
00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 align:start position:0%
not so much a debate between each other
 
00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 align:start position:0%
but it's good to have a uh free-flowing
 
00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 align:start position:0%
discussion and if there is a discussion
 
00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 align:start position:0%
uh I will gladly have a a back and forth
 
00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:12.659 align:start position:0%
with representative Cahill on anything
 
00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 align:start position:0%
he'd like to do and and whatever and
 
00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
that's can be positive for everybody so
 
00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan
 
00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:21.979 align:start position:0%
just to um be clear
 
00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 align:start position:0%
when we spoke about these retained bills
 
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
with the Democratic caucus I encouraged
 
00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 align:start position:0%
everyone to come if they wanted to but
 
00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
the members of this uh
 
00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:35.699 align:start position:0%
work group
 
00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 align:start position:0%
um you know the chairman indicated that
 
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
he wanted to have three Republicans and
 
00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 align:start position:0%
three Democrats on this so the three who
 
00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
are really members of the work group are
 
00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
representative Leclair representative
 
00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:50.699 align:start position:0%
Bouchard and representative Cahill and
 
00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:53.759 align:start position:0%
they'll be doing the uh the three bills
 
00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 align:start position:0%
um in the morning so they will be the
 
00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:58.139 align:start position:0%
group for all three bills and in the
 
00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 align:start position:0%
afternoon for the OSHA Bill it'll be
 
00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 align:start position:0%
myself representative soucy and
 
00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie so just so I
 
00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
mean there may be people coming and
 
00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 align:start position:0%
going I think it's helpful to know what
 
00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
people's role are
 
00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 align:start position:0%
um so uh that that's those are the roles
 
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780 align:start position:0%
in perhaps Mr chairman you can tell us
 
00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:17.540 align:start position:0%
how the Republicans are
 
00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
divided up on this
 
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
I would if I did if I knew
 
00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
um we had a lot of people unable to come
 
00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.600 align:start position:0%
at the last couple a couple days so
 
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.050 align:start position:0%
at the last couple a couple days so
um

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.990 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:37.919 align:start position:0%
you indicated that you wanted to have
 
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.249 align:start position:0%
 
I

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:46.259 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600 align:start position:0%
I did not want to pinpoint I apologize
 
00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180 align:start position:0%
I'm not trying to be coy or anything I I
 
00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
uh some of the folks that are here today
 
00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:55.670 align:start position:0%
uh some of the folks that are here today
um

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 align:start position:0%
will be here for some and others will
 
00:05:59.029 --> 00:05:59.039 align:start position:0%
come in as others and and I'm quite
 
00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:01.139 align:start position:0%
frankly with some of the emails back and
 
00:06:02.749 --> 00:06:02.759 align:start position:0%
forth I'm not sure who's going to be
 
00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:04.220 align:start position:0%
present today
 
00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:06.660 align:start position:0%
when it comes time to
 
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 align:start position:0%
um try to figure out what how we move
 
00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 align:start position:0%
forward it would help I mean we've
 
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:13.740 align:start position:0%
designated three people for each bill
 
00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:15.419 align:start position:0%
um it'd be good if
 
00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:17.699 align:start position:0%
at some point you could designate three
 
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:20.100 align:start position:0%
three Republicans who would be uh
 
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:23.220 align:start position:0%
teaming up with our fine Democratic
 
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280 align:start position:0%
members to figure things out so um
 
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:28.500 align:start position:0%
figure it out Mr chairman representative
 
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
Cahill I just have a suggestion perhaps
 
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
the uh tried and true eenie meeny miny
 
00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:40.249 align:start position:0%
the uh tried and true eenie meeny miny
mo

00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:40.259 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:42.900 align:start position:0%
CK okay
 
00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:45.660 align:start position:0%
I will I will as we uh after this first
 
00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:47.940 align:start position:0%
one I will I know kind of who's going to
 
00:06:50.029 --> 00:06:50.039 align:start position:0%
do what representative uh
 
00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:51.960 align:start position:0%
love and kolkum are doing a few things
 
00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
and um so Robert and Granger and uh
 
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:00.120 align:start position:0%
I wanted to support another one and so I
 
00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:01.740 align:start position:0%
will make sure that I have your your
 
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
list quite frankly I'm I was kind of
 
00:07:04.969 --> 00:07:04.979 align:start position:0%
waiting to see who was going to show up
 
00:07:07.249 --> 00:07:07.259 align:start position:0%
because like I'll be honest with you
 
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
Leno uh abalani called me and said well
 
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
I can't make it I have a guy out I'm
 
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
gonna make it late you know and Leno's
 
00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:15.600 align:start position:0%
the one who's who's going to be uh an
 
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
eye on the OSHA so
 
00:07:20.809 --> 00:07:20.819 align:start position:0%
again not trying to be coy but I do
 
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
respect that you're
 
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:28.860 align:start position:0%
so the first bill we have on the docky
 
00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:30.900 align:start position:0%
here for 10 o'clock is House Bill 190
 
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
relative to the duration of unemployment
 
00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.249 align:start position:0%
relative to the duration of unemployment
benefits

00:07:34.249 --> 00:07:34.259 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:36.300 align:start position:0%
and you know this bill came to us and it
 
00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:41.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:44.689 --> 00:07:44.699 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:49.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:53.940 align:start position:0%
the unemployment rate at the time so the
 
00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate were lower than a
 
00:07:58.909 --> 00:07:58.919 align:start position:0%
certain amount then there would be fewer
 
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
weeks allotted to the individual uh for
 
00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.650 align:start position:0%
weeks allotted to the individual uh for
unemployment

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:03.660 align:start position:0%
unemployment
 
00:08:05.809 --> 00:08:05.819 align:start position:0%
higher the unemployment rate
 
00:08:08.809 --> 00:08:08.819 align:start position:0%
higher the the number of
 
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
weeks available to the employee
 
00:08:13.969 --> 00:08:13.979 align:start position:0%
I think we all agree that there were
 
00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
problems with the Way It Was Written the
 
00:08:18.469 --> 00:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
department had some issues at how they
 
00:08:18.479 --> 00:08:20.050 align:start position:0%
department had some issues at how they
would

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:20.060 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:23.340 align:start position:0%
manage this being that as you know we
 
00:08:28.129 --> 00:08:28.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:28.139 --> 00:08:29.629 align:start position:0%
 
calculated

00:08:29.629 --> 00:08:29.639 align:start position:0%
calculated
 
00:08:32.209 --> 00:08:32.219 align:start position:0%
based on two sets of surveys every month
 
00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:34.680 align:start position:0%
one two businesses and one to employees
 
00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:36.589 align:start position:0%
one two businesses and one to employees
themselves

00:08:36.589 --> 00:08:36.599 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:39.060 align:start position:0%
and that sometimes those are not
 
00:08:41.209 --> 00:08:41.219 align:start position:0%
exact they're perfect and have to be
 
00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:43.260 align:start position:0%
revised the following month based on
 
00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:45.720 align:start position:0%
additional information and it'll be very
 
00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:48.500 align:start position:0%
difficult on a monthly basis with people
 
00:08:51.769 --> 00:08:51.779 align:start position:0%
maybe on unemployment for one month and
 
00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:53.940 align:start position:0%
then get a job and be offer a couple and
 
00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
then maybe add another
 
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:56.990 align:start position:0%
then maybe add another
um

00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:59.630 --> 00:08:59.640 align:start position:0%
that it wasn't tenable so in speaking
 
00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:01.380 align:start position:0%
with the representative
 
00:09:05.509 --> 00:09:05.519 align:start position:0%
turcotte he was
 
00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:07.740 align:start position:0%
floating the idea
 
00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:09.370 align:start position:0%
floating the idea
of

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:09.380 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:11.700 align:start position:0%
decreasing the amount the week's number
 
00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:13.320 align:start position:0%
of weeks of benefits
 
00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
from 26 to 22
 
00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:21.240 align:start position:0%
but increasing the
 
00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.730 align:start position:0%
but increasing the
benefit

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:22.740 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
00:09:24.889 --> 00:09:24.899 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has a relatively low
 
00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:28.680 align:start position:0%
benefit that is provided
 
00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:30.420 align:start position:0%
and that
 
00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:32.940 align:start position:0%
that was what some kind of a compromise
 
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
while reducing the weeks by four is
 
00:09:44.329 --> 00:09:44.339 align:start position:0%
belief is that um
 
00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
the charts that are provided
 
00:09:48.949 --> 00:09:48.959 align:start position:0%
a vast majority of people on
 
00:09:48.959 --> 00:09:50.449 align:start position:0%
a vast majority of people on
unemployment

00:09:50.449 --> 00:09:50.459 align:start position:0%
unemployment
 
00:09:50.459 --> 00:09:53.329 align:start position:0%
unemployment
are

00:09:53.329 --> 00:09:53.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:56.100 align:start position:0%
bind employment
 
00:09:57.949 --> 00:09:57.959 align:start position:0%
within the first two or three months but
 
00:09:59.630 --> 00:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
there's a certain percentage that wait
 
00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
till that that last
 
00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
that last three or four weeks it's like
 
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
eight or ten percent weight
 
00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
till the end
 
00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.829 align:start position:0%
till the end
um

00:10:09.829 --> 00:10:09.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:12.949 --> 00:10:12.959 align:start position:0%
we had discussions as to why that occurs
 
00:10:12.959 --> 00:10:13.910 align:start position:0%
we had discussions as to why that occurs
um

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:18.420 align:start position:0%
but that is where the intent of the
 
00:10:20.389 --> 00:10:20.399 align:start position:0%
representative is at this point so I'll
 
00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:25.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
no worries
 
00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.170 align:start position:0%
no worries
uh

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:30.180 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:10:33.889 --> 00:10:33.899 align:start position:0%
you mentioned so that uh did you mean on
 
00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
on people who are going through the
 
00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:38.940 align:start position:0%
unemployment process wait till the end
 
00:10:41.449 --> 00:10:41.459 align:start position:0%
to get a job is that what you were I
 
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure I understand you
 
00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:47.519 align:start position:0%
if you look at the the charts of how
 
00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
long people stay on how many weeks on
 
00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:52.140 align:start position:0%
average not on average how many weeks
 
00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:53.940 align:start position:0%
people have unemployment obviously the
 
00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
first three or four weeks is higher than
 
00:10:57.889 --> 00:10:57.899 align:start position:0%
it goes It goes down and the curve
 
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
continues to go down and then it kind of
 
00:11:02.269 --> 00:11:02.279 align:start position:0%
spikes the last two weeks interesting
 
00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:04.200 align:start position:0%
well I can say
 
00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:06.180 align:start position:0%
um in terms of the notion of a waiting
 
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
time all of the requirements because I
 
00:11:11.389 --> 00:11:11.399 align:start position:0%
have been unemployed twice in the last
 
00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:13.500 align:start position:0%
10 years and I don't think this part has
 
00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:14.810 align:start position:0%
10 years and I don't think this part has
changed

00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:14.820 align:start position:0%
changed
 
00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:15.949 align:start position:0%
changed
um

00:11:15.949 --> 00:11:15.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:19.620 align:start position:0%
you you cannot wait to look for work you
 
00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
have to every week to receive any of the
 
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
unemployment assistance you have to uh
 
00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:29.060 align:start position:0%
can not only agree
 
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
uh in your in your agreements that you
 
00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
do weekly there is a notice that you
 
00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
check that says uh I am continuing to
 
00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
look for work and then you are supposed
 
00:11:42.949 --> 00:11:42.959 align:start position:0%
to report at least two of those and the
 
00:11:44.509 --> 00:11:44.519 align:start position:0%
assumption is you're doing way more than
 
00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
two of those I can't I can't explain
 
00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:49.380 align:start position:0%
what a blip at the end would mean other
 
00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
than as you know I'm in a field that
 
00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:53.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a ton of workers so
 
00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
that could be one of those I mean some
 
00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
people just are in jobs that don't have
 
00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of openings for one reason or
 
00:12:02.569 --> 00:12:02.579 align:start position:0%
another at certain points in our economy
 
00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:04.200 align:start position:0%
but they're
 
00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
again I can't explain the blip but
 
00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
legally you cannot receive and you agree
 
00:12:12.769 --> 00:12:12.779 align:start position:0%
that you cannot receive uh if you aren't
 
00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:16.380 align:start position:0%
actively looking for work every week and
 
00:12:18.769 --> 00:12:18.779 align:start position:0%
if you stop looking for work for a week
 
00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you can get back on it
 
00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:22.620 align:start position:0%
but I do know that you have you're not
 
00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
allowed to receive it for that week like
 
00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:26.640 align:start position:0%
I don't know maybe you went to
 
00:12:28.009 --> 00:12:28.019 align:start position:0%
somebody's wedding out of the state or
 
00:12:29.509 --> 00:12:29.519 align:start position:0%
something I don't know if you can even
 
00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
go back on unemployment after that but
 
00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
if you are not actively looking for week
 
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
for work every week and report at least
 
00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:40.680 align:start position:0%
two employers that you've communicated
 
00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
with or applied for a job uh just know
 
00:12:47.389 --> 00:12:47.399 align:start position:0%
that there really isn't a waiting period
 
00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
I hope that's helpful no I understand
 
00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
there is a one-week waiting period as we
 
00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:54.420 align:start position:0%
all know but you are correct there are
 
00:12:56.509 --> 00:12:56.519 align:start position:0%
certain there are a number of mechanisms
 
00:12:58.910 --> 00:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
that are required
 
00:13:01.009 --> 00:13:01.019 align:start position:0%
from vocational training to showing up
 
00:13:03.889 --> 00:13:03.899 align:start position:0%
to going to get your resume
 
00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:08.220 align:start position:0%
um worked on to to requiring correct
 
00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:09.660 align:start position:0%
um you have to look for work you can't
 
00:13:11.329 --> 00:13:11.339 align:start position:0%
be gone on vacation for a week or two
 
00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:14.220 align:start position:0%
and you're no doubt you are correct on
 
00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
all those uh venues one of the other
 
00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
reasons I I see your hands gentlemen one
 
00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:20.700 align:start position:0%
of the other reasons
 
00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:23.220 align:start position:0%
um that I think we determined that some
 
00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
people wait
 
00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:30.060 align:start position:0%
a thing called partially unemployed if
 
00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
you will kind of started the last time
 
00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
we had a little recession uh for some of
 
00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:36.300 align:start position:0%
you folks that are new to the
 
00:13:38.269 --> 00:13:38.279 align:start position:0%
um the committee
 
00:13:42.889 --> 00:13:42.899 align:start position:0%
it it used to be uh you you can now get
 
00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:44.220 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits if you were used
 
00:13:45.949 --> 00:13:45.959 align:start position:0%
to working 40 hours a week and your
 
00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:48.060 align:start position:0%
employer says look we're having a we
 
00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:49.500 align:start position:0%
don't have a lot of work this week I'm
 
00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
going to bring you down to 20 hours for
 
00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:52.980 align:start position:0%
the next three weeks I can only give you
 
00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
20 hours
 
00:13:56.449 --> 00:13:56.459 align:start position:0%
so there is an ability to get some of
 
00:13:58.730 --> 00:13:58.740 align:start position:0%
the partial so if you have someone that
 
00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:01.500 align:start position:0%
is going to you know you know you
 
00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't look like it now with a 1.9
 
00:14:05.629 --> 00:14:05.639 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate but some of us who've
 
00:14:06.829 --> 00:14:06.839 align:start position:0%
been here long enough on this committee
 
00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:09.300 align:start position:0%
remember when we had you know a higher
 
00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:11.160 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate and it wasn't as easy
 
00:14:14.269 --> 00:14:14.279 align:start position:0%
to find uh find work
 
00:14:16.129 --> 00:14:16.139 align:start position:0%
um and you would you know employers
 
00:14:17.509 --> 00:14:17.519 align:start position:0%
might say see you know for the next five
 
00:14:18.769 --> 00:14:18.779 align:start position:0%
or six months especially during the
 
00:14:20.329 --> 00:14:20.339 align:start position:0%
winter season or whatever if we're slow
 
00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be able to give you
 
00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:22.250 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be able to give you
that

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:22.260 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:14:25.009 --> 00:14:25.019 align:start position:0%
the full time and so people will do that
 
00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
and that could be one of the reasons you
 
00:14:29.329 --> 00:14:29.339 align:start position:0%
have that spike in the end that last
 
00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
couple weeks that certain people stay on
 
00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:33.720 align:start position:0%
for a longer period of time so there's
 
00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
other reasons that are not
 
00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:37.370 align:start position:0%
other reasons that are not
nefarious

00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:37.380 align:start position:0%
nefarious
 
00:14:40.069 --> 00:14:40.079 align:start position:0%
uh as you know I'm just going to hang
 
00:14:42.889 --> 00:14:42.899 align:start position:0%
out and we've all heard stories you know
 
00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:45.720 align:start position:0%
people that well I you know take a
 
00:14:47.689 --> 00:14:47.699 align:start position:0%
summer off but you know I think those
 
00:14:49.509 --> 00:14:49.519 align:start position:0%
are few and far between
 
00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:52.860 align:start position:0%
Bouchard and Cahill please
 
00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:54.540 align:start position:0%
um thank you
 
00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:56.940 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um
 
00:14:58.790 --> 00:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
fortunately I've never had to go through
 
00:15:00.189 --> 00:15:00.199 align:start position:0%
that experience
 
00:15:02.689 --> 00:15:02.699 align:start position:0%
however according to the data that was
 
00:15:04.189 --> 00:15:04.199 align:start position:0%
given to us
 
00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:06.420 align:start position:0%
the majority of the people who are
 
00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:08.820 align:start position:0%
following that category are going
 
00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:09.650 align:start position:0%
following that category are going
through

00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:09.660 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:15:13.129 --> 00:15:13.139 align:start position:0%
the limit are people with disabilities
 
00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:14.820 align:start position:0%
people who have child care
 
00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:16.970 align:start position:0%
people who have child care
responsibilities

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:16.980 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
 
00:15:18.889 --> 00:15:18.899 align:start position:0%
such as women
 
00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:22.380 align:start position:0%
and also Elder older workers
 
00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:24.959 align:start position:0%
and that are have a really difficult
 
00:15:28.129 --> 00:15:28.139 align:start position:0%
time trying to find a job
 
00:15:29.689 --> 00:15:29.699 align:start position:0%
I think you should also include in there
 
00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:31.620 align:start position:0%
if I could expand on what you're saying
 
00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:33.180 align:start position:0%
representative Bouchard
 
00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:36.180 align:start position:0%
individuals who may have been
 
00:15:38.689 --> 00:15:38.699 align:start position:0%
um in an occupation for
 
00:15:41.629 --> 00:15:41.639 align:start position:0%
the last 25 or 30 years and there's been
 
00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:45.660 align:start position:0%
changes in that so I will use a machine
 
00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:48.060 align:start position:0%
shop as an example you're used to using
 
00:15:50.509 --> 00:15:50.519 align:start position:0%
your hands with a machine shop and now
 
00:15:52.069 --> 00:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
there really aren't that many machine
 
00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
shops where you use your hands anymore
 
00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:55.620 align:start position:0%
and you have to learn a computer skill
 
00:15:58.310 --> 00:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
because they're CAD based uh computer
 
00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
screens and the machines do the work
 
00:16:04.189 --> 00:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
uh and you need more vocational training
 
00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:05.940 align:start position:0%
because you really can't find one of
 
00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:08.220 align:start position:0%
those jobs that you used to have because
 
00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:10.860 align:start position:0%
they're not doing it that way anymore
 
00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
representative Cahill yeah uh thank you
 
00:16:15.889 --> 00:16:15.899 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and I think you and my
 
00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
colleagues to my right here have covered
 
00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:19.860 align:start position:0%
most of what I was going to say about
 
00:16:22.129 --> 00:16:22.139 align:start position:0%
this because the statistics don't get
 
00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:24.380 align:start position:0%
into the details about the circumstances
 
00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:27.180 align:start position:0%
it could be that you live in Coos County
 
00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
and there just aren't as many jobs as
 
00:16:32.449 --> 00:16:32.459 align:start position:0%
there would be in Hillsborough County or
 
00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
that like you said yours the skill set
 
00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:37.560 align:start position:0%
that you have or your age you're a Gray
 
00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:41.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
I'm with you brother to uh you know the
 
00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
employer and uh so there's a lot of
 
00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:49.860 align:start position:0%
factors but I what I don't think is is a
 
00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
problem is that our benefits are too
 
00:16:53.269 --> 00:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
generous or so generous to the point
 
00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:54.660 align:start position:0%
where people are kicking back and just
 
00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
saying I had everything I need on you
 
00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:57.650 align:start position:0%
saying I had everything I need on you
know

00:16:57.650 --> 00:16:57.660 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:00.060 align:start position:0%
on this uh amount of money that the
 
00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:01.500 align:start position:0%
state pays me and I don't I'm not going
 
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
to bother looking I don't I don't think
 
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
we I don't think the bill is really
 
00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:06.780 align:start position:0%
focused on an area that we need
 
00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
attention to
 
00:17:10.610 --> 00:17:10.620 align:start position:0%
in speaking with the uh assistant
 
00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:12.049 align:start position:0%
in speaking with the uh assistant
commissioner

00:17:12.049 --> 00:17:12.059 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
I asked
 
00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:17.100 align:start position:0%
if a couple times a year he or other
 
00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:21.660 align:start position:0%
members of his staff go on these
 
00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:25.079 align:start position:0%
I don't know what you call them uh they
 
00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:27.660 align:start position:0%
all meet people chairman and vice
 
00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:29.640 align:start position:0%
chairman will meet from somewhere across
 
00:17:33.909 --> 00:17:33.919 align:start position:0%
the country with other uh excuse me uh
 
00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:36.660 align:start position:0%
yes thank you it was a convention but a
 
00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:38.100 align:start position:0%
conference and they get together and
 
00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:39.240 align:start position:0%
they go to these conferences they say is
 
00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:40.500 align:start position:0%
there anything you've learned that other
 
00:17:42.409 --> 00:17:42.419 align:start position:0%
states have done that you could bring
 
00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:44.340 align:start position:0%
back that has to do with that last those
 
00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
people that are hanging on that last
 
00:17:48.289 --> 00:17:48.299 align:start position:0%
couple weeks and he actually quite
 
00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
frankly felt that New Hampshire was kind
 
00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
of ahead of the curve on a lot compared
 
00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:53.940 align:start position:0%
to a lot of their their counterparts in
 
00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:56.280 align:start position:0%
other states we are a little more
 
00:17:59.330 --> 00:17:59.340 align:start position:0%
aggressive than others in helping people
 
00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:00.289 align:start position:0%
aggressive than others in helping people
get

00:18:00.289 --> 00:18:00.299 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:02.940 align:start position:0%
back and there really wasn't anything in
 
00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
any of these conferences that they had
 
00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:06.720 align:start position:0%
gone to where they had seen anything
 
00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:08.700 align:start position:0%
that any other state had come up with it
 
00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:09.529 align:start position:0%
that any other state had come up with it
was

00:18:09.529 --> 00:18:09.539 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:11.340 align:start position:0%
that great and wonderful that we should
 
00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:14.340 align:start position:0%
adopt representative Sullivan oh Lord
 
00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:17.160 align:start position:0%
Sullivan yeah okay Brian representative
 
00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:19.020 align:start position:0%
that's a worth the other Brian
 
00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:22.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh so my concern
 
00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:24.360 align:start position:0%
here is I'm not sure what we're trying
 
00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:25.980 align:start position:0%
to solve
 
00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:28.500 align:start position:0%
um so for example I think everyone here
 
00:18:31.549 --> 00:18:31.559 align:start position:0%
would agree that our goal is not to
 
00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:35.340 align:start position:0%
spend as little money as possible
 
00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:38.100 align:start position:0%
um is our goal to get people back to
 
00:18:40.789 --> 00:18:40.799 align:start position:0%
work the fastest that's one of the
 
00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:43.140 align:start position:0%
metrics that we tout but as you just
 
00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:46.140 align:start position:0%
explained that isn't necessarily the
 
00:18:48.049 --> 00:18:48.059 align:start position:0%
best thing if someone needs to be
 
00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:50.820 align:start position:0%
retrained in a computer skill that they
 
00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:53.460 align:start position:0%
never had it might take more time to do
 
00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:55.740 align:start position:0%
that so
 
00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:57.710 align:start position:0%
that so
um

00:18:57.710 --> 00:18:57.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
and I I think that is the right starting
 
00:19:01.789 --> 00:19:01.799 align:start position:0%
point talking to the department and
 
00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:04.380 align:start position:0%
saying what are we doing right what have
 
00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
you seen done elsewhere that might be
 
00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:07.510 align:start position:0%
you seen done elsewhere that might be
better

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
better
 
00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:10.260 align:start position:0%
this approach feels like kind of a shot
 
00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:13.140 align:start position:0%
in the dark that well maybe things would
 
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
be better if we
 
00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
cut the weeks by this much and it's not
 
00:19:21.409 --> 00:19:21.419 align:start position:0%
I don't see what we're trying to
 
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
accomplish and therefore how this is
 
00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:28.260 align:start position:0%
getting us there it more seems like just
 
00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
a thing to try that
 
00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:32.580 align:start position:0%
could help
 
00:19:36.169 --> 00:19:36.179 align:start position:0%
um for myself I I would need to start
 
00:19:39.169 --> 00:19:39.179 align:start position:0%
with that goal and that
 
00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:41.820 align:start position:0%
approach that's going to achieve that
 
00:19:45.049 --> 00:19:45.059 align:start position:0%
goal rather than simply
 
00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
let's try something that might help no I
 
00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
agree that's why I had asked the
 
00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:52.140 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner about these
 
00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
conferences is there anything else we're
 
00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:55.980 align:start position:0%
not doing to tag you're right if you're
 
00:19:57.950 --> 00:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
going to solve the problem
 
00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
solve the problem don't create something
 
00:20:03.409 --> 00:20:03.419 align:start position:0%
that's not solving anything that's just
 
00:20:03.419 --> 00:20:04.010 align:start position:0%
that's not solving anything that's just
um

00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:04.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:06.529 --> 00:20:06.539 align:start position:0%
uh try to find out that last
 
00:20:07.789 --> 00:20:07.799 align:start position:0%
10 percent
 
00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:10.500 align:start position:0%
of the clerk yeah thank you
 
00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
so you mentioned the possibility of
 
00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:14.460 align:start position:0%
increasing the benefit
 
00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:17.960 align:start position:0%
who does that is that does it is the Des
 
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
totally in charge of what it is or and
 
00:20:21.529 --> 00:20:21.539 align:start position:0%
then it comes before the house
 
00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
legislature okay and and if so I mean
 
00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:28.140 align:start position:0%
what would be the thought process and uh
 
00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:31.320 align:start position:0%
a percentage or you know kind of cost of
 
00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:33.660 align:start position:0%
living type thing or
 
00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:35.700 align:start position:0%
I mean I don't how do we have any idea
 
00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
how long it's been at where it is now
 
00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:41.460 align:start position:0%
20 years Brian I think it's probably I
 
00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:43.620 align:start position:0%
I've been here almost 20 years and it's
 
00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:46.140 align:start position:0%
been the second time off but you know up
 
00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
here and uh I I don't I think it has
 
00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:51.660 align:start position:0%
been done in 20 years
 
00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:53.340 align:start position:0%
do you remember when the last time it
 
00:20:59.930 --> 00:20:59.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:09.289 --> 00:21:09.299 align:start position:0%
it's been a long time and and um so that
 
00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
might be something just initially to to
 
00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:13.980 align:start position:0%
get the ball rolling and to find out how
 
00:21:15.529 --> 00:21:15.539 align:start position:0%
long it's been maybe do a couple of
 
00:21:19.789 --> 00:21:19.799 align:start position:0%
colas or however it's typically gone up
 
00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
and kind of figure it out from there I
 
00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
mean personally I don't I don't mind the
 
00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
26 weeks it's been that way for a long
 
00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:27.660 align:start position:0%
time as well so I'm usually that's only
 
00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
the state you know the federal
 
00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:31.500 align:start position:0%
government also in certain times has
 
00:21:34.549 --> 00:21:34.559 align:start position:0%
adds other other benefits on
 
00:21:36.289 --> 00:21:36.299 align:start position:0%
um when they see fit
 
00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan
 
00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:43.020 align:start position:0%
thank you the um
 
00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:44.510 align:start position:0%
thank you the um
I

00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
I guess um the horse trade of uh
 
00:21:49.669 --> 00:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
increase in benefits in exchange for
 
00:21:51.649 --> 00:21:51.659 align:start position:0%
decreasing weeks
 
00:21:54.169 --> 00:21:54.179 align:start position:0%
um you know it it's a little too vague
 
00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:55.260 align:start position:0%
for me
 
00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:55.970 align:start position:0%
for me
um

00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:55.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
and then I guess the other thing you
 
00:22:00.289 --> 00:22:00.299 align:start position:0%
know I just opened the uh
 
00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:02.700 align:start position:0%
booklet that the Deputy Commissioner
 
00:22:06.169 --> 00:22:06.179 align:start position:0%
brought to us to describe where we're at
 
00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:10.740 align:start position:0%
and it's too small to uh see everything
 
00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
but the green on this map
 
00:22:16.909 --> 00:22:16.919 align:start position:0%
26 weeks
 
00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
all of New England except for Rhode
 
00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
Island has got 26 weeks
 
00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
they probably also receive a higher
 
00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:26.100 align:start position:0%
level of benefits than New Hampshire
 
00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:28.200 align:start position:0%
because we're we're definitely on the
 
00:22:31.669 --> 00:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
low side so for us to give up weeks in
 
00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:34.140 align:start position:0%
exchange for gaining ground on the other
 
00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
New England states with regard to
 
00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:37.860 align:start position:0%
benefits doesn't seem to make a whole
 
00:22:39.529 --> 00:22:39.539 align:start position:0%
lot of sense
 
00:22:40.789 --> 00:22:40.799 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
um so I I just doesn't doesn't make
 
00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
sense to me Rhode Island by the way has
 
00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:49.860 align:start position:0%
got 30 weeks so um it it um
 
00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:51.960 align:start position:0%
and I guess if if representative
 
00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:54.780 align:start position:0%
turcotte has a new plan
 
00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
um I would expect that he would have
 
00:22:58.549 --> 00:22:58.559 align:start position:0%
been here to present it to us but
 
00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
obviously he is not
 
00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:04.500 align:start position:0%
um so I'm the friendly Skies uh I I I I
 
00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
I I would recommend that we do nothing
 
00:23:07.850 --> 00:23:07.860 align:start position:0%
with this
 
00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
um and um perhaps uh
 
00:23:15.049 --> 00:23:15.059 align:start position:0%
some one of us ought to look at uh
 
00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:16.980 align:start position:0%
um the level of benefits and see if it
 
00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
does warrant increasing it but I don't
 
00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:20.460 align:start position:0%
think it warrants an increase in
 
00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:29.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:32.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair on the subject of
 
00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
raising the benefits it's not for lack
 
00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:36.780 align:start position:0%
of trying I I think I've seen a few of
 
00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
those bills in recent years and it also
 
00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
seems sort of counter-intuitive to what
 
00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
Representatives turcott's goal you know
 
00:23:48.289 --> 00:23:48.299 align:start position:0%
I'll give you more money and if he's
 
00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:49.860 align:start position:0%
thinking that we're already giving them
 
00:23:52.610 --> 00:23:52.620 align:start position:0%
too much money I'm not sure this uh
 
00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:53.820 align:start position:0%
holds up
 
00:23:56.890 --> 00:23:56.900 align:start position:0%
but uh I do think that with the uh
 
00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
unemployment people have a variety of
 
00:24:03.409 --> 00:24:03.419 align:start position:0%
incentives for uh employers as well they
 
00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
offer to help pay for training or to or
 
00:24:08.149 --> 00:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
to make up the wage difference uh they
 
00:24:10.669 --> 00:24:10.679 align:start position:0%
have a very good programs to help people
 
00:24:12.529 --> 00:24:12.539 align:start position:0%
get back to work if there's anything
 
00:24:15.169 --> 00:24:15.179 align:start position:0%
else that we might do for coordinating
 
00:24:18.049 --> 00:24:18.059 align:start position:0%
with industry and the and the department
 
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
I think that would be helpful of course
 
00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:23.700 align:start position:0%
having more people of working age is
 
00:24:25.549 --> 00:24:25.559 align:start position:0%
another good step if we can find a way
 
00:24:27.169 --> 00:24:27.179 align:start position:0%
to do that but I don't think I could
 
00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:29.100 align:start position:0%
support this bill
 
00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:32.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
um I believe unless another state has
 
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
lowered their rates we Remain the lowest
 
00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:41.820 align:start position:0%
in the nation
 
00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:42.710 align:start position:0%
in the nation
um

00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:44.029 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:24:44.029 --> 00:24:44.039 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:24:46.549 --> 00:24:46.559 align:start position:0%
I will oppose this bill as well and I
 
00:24:48.169 --> 00:24:48.179 align:start position:0%
could say a few other things but I'll
 
00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:58.010 --> 00:24:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:02.580 align:start position:0%
real dragon ah Ranger sorry
 
00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:04.740 align:start position:0%
look at it Mike think of you sorry
 
00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:07.140 align:start position:0%
we got two of them but
 
00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
um so I actually like the idea of the
 
00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:10.860 align:start position:0%
bill and the reason I like the idea of
 
00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
the bill is you know maybe I break from
 
00:25:13.549 --> 00:25:13.559 align:start position:0%
a lot of the members here but I actually
 
00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:15.780 align:start position:0%
do think that a responsible governance
 
00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:17.400 align:start position:0%
requires that we spend as little
 
00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:20.100 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars as possible and seeing
 
00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:22.200 align:start position:0%
as they cannot give any unemployment
 
00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:24.360 align:start position:0%
benefits to anybody unless they take it
 
00:25:26.269 --> 00:25:26.279 align:start position:0%
from somebody else I would like to
 
00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:27.480 align:start position:0%
reduce the amount that they're taking
 
00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
altogether and so if this can result in
 
00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:32.700 align:start position:0%
less spending overall then I would
 
00:25:35.149 --> 00:25:35.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:41.149 --> 00:25:41.159 align:start position:0%
going way back uh I think maybe in the
 
00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
70s or so the Massachusetts had a
 
00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:46.260 align:start position:0%
program where you could get an extension
 
00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:48.900 align:start position:0%
and it was for times of extreme
 
00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
unemployment you know and I I don't know
 
00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
what the numbers were whether they were
 
00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:54.900 align:start position:0%
seven eight nine percent whatever uh
 
00:25:57.649 --> 00:25:57.659 align:start position:0%
if we tax something like that onto this
 
00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:02.340 align:start position:0%
you know where we reduce but if we hit a
 
00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
um you know a a point where you know
 
00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:07.380 align:start position:0%
where there's a lot of unemployment and
 
00:26:09.649 --> 00:26:09.659 align:start position:0%
it's hard to get jobs uh you know you
 
00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:11.340 align:start position:0%
could you could get a six-week extension
 
00:26:12.529 --> 00:26:12.539 align:start position:0%
or whatever
 
00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:15.480 align:start position:0%
um how would uh how would people feel
 
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:23.220 align:start position:0%
boy you put me on the spot how do I feel
 
00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:25.310 align:start position:0%
boy you put me on the spot how do I feel
I

00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:25.320 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:32.340 align:start position:0%
just just a thought that's what the
 
00:26:36.409 --> 00:26:36.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:38.340 align:start position:0%

representative Sullivan the three
 
00:31:59.090 --> 00:31:59.100 align:start position:0%
Republicans for the next bill House Bill
 
00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:01.500 align:start position:0%

Dan's name is Leclair
 
00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:26.220 align:start position:0%
the sea is silent
 
00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:29.700 align:start position:0%
good I I learned that when I spent uh
 
00:32:31.789 --> 00:32:31.799 align:start position:0%
almost 20 years up in the north country
 
00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
with the uh the French Canadians in
 
00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
Berlin so
 
00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:48.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:51.649 --> 00:32:51.659 align:start position:0%
so the house bill 82 FN relatives are
 
00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:53.100 align:start position:0%
employment protection for participants
 
00:32:55.789 --> 00:32:55.799 align:start position:0%
in therapeutic cannabis program uh had
 
00:32:57.710 --> 00:32:57.720 align:start position:0%
its impetus from a New Hampshire Supreme
 
00:33:00.610 --> 00:33:00.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:02.210 align:start position:0%
 
that

00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:02.220 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:02.990 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:09.289 --> 00:33:09.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:12.169 --> 00:33:12.179 align:start position:0%
was injured
 
00:33:14.269 --> 00:33:14.279 align:start position:0%
is provided I'm sorry to try to pull up
 
00:33:16.130 --> 00:33:16.140 align:start position:0%
the build
 
00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
uh was um
 
00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:22.440 align:start position:0%
let go because they were utilizing
 
00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis for their injury
 
00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:27.240 align:start position:0%
and the Supreme Court said no uh it is
 
00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
law you're allowed to do it and so we
 
00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:32.460 align:start position:0%
had a number of conversations about
 
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
the uh Supreme Court ruling
 
00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
what it said
 
00:33:39.769 --> 00:33:39.779 align:start position:0%
what it meant what we should do and
 
00:33:42.289 --> 00:33:42.299 align:start position:0%
there were some uh disagreements well
 
00:33:45.250 --> 00:33:45.260 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to say anything and um so
 
00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:47.340 align:start position:0%
there were some questions and some
 
00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:50.460 align:start position:0%
concerns about the bill and that's why
 
00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:52.440 align:start position:0%
we had retained it so it's open for
 
00:33:54.289 --> 00:33:54.299 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Sullivan if
 
00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:55.860 align:start position:0%
you'd like or representative seaworth if
 
00:33:57.049 --> 00:33:57.059 align:start position:0%
you'd like either one of you gentlemen
 
00:33:57.950 --> 00:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
can start
 
00:34:01.549 --> 00:34:01.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:03.720 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to start
 
00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:04.549 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to start
um

00:34:04.549 --> 00:34:04.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:06.360 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman you know that we've had
 
00:34:08.570 --> 00:34:08.580 align:start position:0%
conversations on the phone on this issue
 
00:34:11.450 --> 00:34:11.460 align:start position:0%
and um at one point
 
00:34:15.829 --> 00:34:15.839 align:start position:0%
um you know the discussion had been
 
00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:17.580 align:start position:0%
um over
 
00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:20.240 align:start position:0%
um current employees who get a
 
00:34:23.210 --> 00:34:23.220 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis card in the course
 
00:34:25.849 --> 00:34:25.859 align:start position:0%
of employment and then the new employee
 
00:34:29.629 --> 00:34:29.639 align:start position:0%
who is just being hired with a
 
00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:34.200 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis card and um uh you
 
00:34:35.869 --> 00:34:35.879 align:start position:0%
had suggested that perhaps we could
 
00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
cover the the uh the current employees
 
00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:40.369 align:start position:0%
cover the the uh the current employees
in

00:34:40.369 --> 00:34:40.379 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:34:40.379 --> 00:34:41.149 align:start position:0%
in
um

00:34:41.149 --> 00:34:41.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:44.280 align:start position:0%
allow discrimination against the the
 
00:34:47.149 --> 00:34:47.159 align:start position:0%
prospective employees and the way I
 
00:34:50.149 --> 00:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
answered that is that all types of
 
00:34:52.810 --> 00:34:52.820 align:start position:0%
discrimination cover
 
00:34:55.909 --> 00:34:55.919 align:start position:0%
employees through the hiring process and
 
00:34:58.430 --> 00:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
through the course of employment and I I
 
00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:03.200 align:start position:0%
just can't Envision can't support
 
00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:06.740 align:start position:0%
dividing that out with this issue
 
00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:10.260 align:start position:0%
if you know you can't discriminate
 
00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
against someone because of their race
 
00:35:15.349 --> 00:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
their religion their gender at the point
 
00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
of hire or throughout their the course
 
00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:23.160 align:start position:0%
of employment and on this issue I would
 
00:35:26.089 --> 00:35:26.099 align:start position:0%
suggest that we need to do the same that
 
00:35:28.930 --> 00:35:28.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:32.280 align:start position:0%
Bar discrimination through the on the
 
00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:34.140 align:start position:0%
hiring process as well as through the
 
00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
course of employment so um I feel
 
00:35:38.349 --> 00:35:38.359 align:start position:0%
strongly that way
 
00:35:43.370 --> 00:35:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:45.050 --> 00:35:45.060 align:start position:0%
representative Holcomb
 
00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:46.370 align:start position:0%
representative Holcomb
oh

00:35:46.370 --> 00:35:46.380 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I didn't know
 
00:35:53.230 --> 00:35:53.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:57.109 --> 00:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so
 
00:35:59.450 --> 00:35:59.460 align:start position:0%
um you had mentioned the Supreme Court
 
00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
ruling that was a discussion that you
 
00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:05.220 align:start position:0%
and I had uh and it was one of my
 
00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:07.260 align:start position:0%
concerns with the language of the bill
 
00:36:10.849 --> 00:36:10.859 align:start position:0%
it was brought up in uh testimony a
 
00:36:13.310 --> 00:36:13.320 align:start position:0%
number of times that the driver for this
 
00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
was that the law is not consistent with
 
00:36:20.450 --> 00:36:20.460 align:start position:0%
what the Supreme Court ruling was so I
 
00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
dug out the Supreme Court ruling and
 
00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:25.020 align:start position:0%
tried to figure out what it said
 
00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:27.470 align:start position:0%
tried to figure out what it said
and

00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:27.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:36:31.849 --> 00:36:31.859 align:start position:0%
it is a little different than what I had
 
00:36:34.250 --> 00:36:34.260 align:start position:0%
anticipated from the discussion about it
 
00:36:37.609 --> 00:36:37.619 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court ruling does not say
 
00:36:40.490 --> 00:36:40.500 align:start position:0%
that you can't fire someone with a
 
00:36:42.650 --> 00:36:42.660 align:start position:0%
medical marijuana card or even you can't
 
00:36:45.410 --> 00:36:45.420 align:start position:0%
fire someone because
 
00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:49.320 align:start position:0%
of a medical marijuana issue what it
 
00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
says is that
 
00:36:55.370 --> 00:36:55.380 align:start position:0%
um you have to treat it like
 
00:36:59.150 --> 00:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
any other workplace accommodation
 
00:37:01.130 --> 00:37:01.140 align:start position:0%
so that
 
00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:02.030 align:start position:0%
so that
um

00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:04.370 --> 00:37:04.380 align:start position:0%
someone has a medical marijuana card and
 
00:37:06.829 --> 00:37:06.839 align:start position:0%
the employer can still say all right
 
00:37:09.170 --> 00:37:09.180 align:start position:0%
here's what I will do to accommodate
 
00:37:13.870 --> 00:37:13.880 align:start position:0%
that person uh maybe anything from
 
00:37:16.849 --> 00:37:16.859 align:start position:0%
adjusting their schedule when they might
 
00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
be medicated or or maybe changing their
 
00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:23.700 align:start position:0%
duties from something that might be at
 
00:37:27.430 --> 00:37:27.440 align:start position:0%
risk for a federal license or whatever
 
00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
but like uh
 
00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:33.720 align:start position:0%
other workplace accommodations it
 
00:37:36.349 --> 00:37:36.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't simply say that you must it says
 
00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
that you must weigh the cost of that
 
00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:41.630 align:start position:0%
that you must weigh the cost of that
accommodation

00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:41.640 align:start position:0%
accommodation
 
00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:43.270 align:start position:0%
accommodation
um

00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:43.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:47.569 --> 00:37:47.579 align:start position:0%
with your your business needs so
 
00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
that was my concern with the language is
 
00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
that I felt like the language in the
 
00:37:57.530 --> 00:37:57.540 align:start position:0%
build didn't match the areas of the law
 
00:38:00.650 --> 00:38:00.660 align:start position:0%
that the Supreme Court
 
00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:03.540 align:start position:0%
decision went down
 
00:38:06.290 --> 00:38:06.300 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:08.040 align:start position:0%
I asked for it to be interim study
 
00:38:10.010 --> 00:38:10.020 align:start position:0%
because I I thought it might be more
 
00:38:12.170 --> 00:38:12.180 align:start position:0%
appropriate to match those two scenarios
 
00:38:15.069 --> 00:38:15.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:17.810 --> 00:38:17.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
um my position unfortunately is the
 
00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
complete opposite of Representative
 
00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
Sullivan and we really are on on
 
00:38:27.530 --> 00:38:27.540 align:start position:0%
opposite ends on this one
 
00:38:30.290 --> 00:38:30.300 align:start position:0%
um and where there's discussion
 
00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
regarding the discrimination and that we
 
00:38:33.730 --> 00:38:33.740 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have discrimination
 
00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:35.640 align:start position:0%
unfortunately with the amendment that
 
00:38:37.970 --> 00:38:37.980 align:start position:0%
was put through there is outlined in
 
00:38:40.370 --> 00:38:40.380 align:start position:0%
discrimination in this and that we have
 
00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
carved out specific positions that would
 
00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
be exempt
 
00:38:48.050 --> 00:38:48.060 align:start position:0%
um from the non-hiring process such as
 
00:38:49.849 --> 00:38:49.859 align:start position:0%
the police the fire the health care
 
00:38:53.930 --> 00:38:53.940 align:start position:0%
federal DOT there are specific positions
 
00:38:57.710 --> 00:38:57.720 align:start position:0%
exempt that would prohibit employers
 
00:39:00.109 --> 00:39:00.119 align:start position:0%
from hiring these people if they were to
 
00:39:03.770 --> 00:39:03.780 align:start position:0%
test positive solely for cannabis and I
 
00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:05.460 align:start position:0%
don't think we should be either we take
 
00:39:09.530 --> 00:39:09.540 align:start position:0%
out all exemptions or we allow the
 
00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
employers to make a decision based on
 
00:39:14.089 --> 00:39:14.099 align:start position:0%
the risk factors of their jobs that are
 
00:39:17.569 --> 00:39:17.579 align:start position:0%
available I still feel strongly that we
 
00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
should not be having impaired
 
00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
electricians HVAC mechanics drivers who
 
00:39:26.690 --> 00:39:26.700 align:start position:0%
do not require a DOL card
 
00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:27.349 align:start position:0%
do not require a DOL card
um

00:39:27.349 --> 00:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
and and other people that are using high
 
00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
risk equipment and other high-risk
 
00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
positions that we have those employers
 
00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
should be able to make a decision
 
00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
of who they're going to hire and they
 
00:39:39.530 --> 00:39:39.540 align:start position:0%
don't know that when they're offering
 
00:39:42.530 --> 00:39:42.540 align:start position:0%
the job and they're placing this passing
 
00:39:44.690 --> 00:39:44.700 align:start position:0%
of a drug screening as a contingency of
 
00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:45.770 align:start position:0%
of a drug screening as a contingency of
offer

00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:45.780 align:start position:0%
offer
 
00:39:48.890 --> 00:39:48.900 align:start position:0%
so we either take all positions out and
 
00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
we do not discriminate as representative
 
00:39:54.290 --> 00:39:54.300 align:start position:0%
Sullivan pointed out or we do allow
 
00:39:59.329 --> 00:39:59.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:01.609 --> 00:40:01.619 align:start position:0%
comes out of love oh I'm sorry gentlemen
 
00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
I'll get you after representative love
 
00:40:05.569 --> 00:40:05.579 align:start position:0%
Bouchard and Cahill
 
00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:08.700 align:start position:0%
uh right here uh you know I've always
 
00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:11.160 align:start position:0%
argued about the the workplace accidents
 
00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
and stuff uh you know regarding this and
 
00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:16.020 align:start position:0%
uh this here says
 
00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:17.880 align:start position:0%
positive marijuana test following work
 
00:40:19.730 --> 00:40:19.740 align:start position:0%
workplace accidents are the highest in
 
00:40:21.890 --> 00:40:21.900 align:start position:0%
25 years okay because states are
 
00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
adopting this I don't think New
 
00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire should be following it fallen
 
00:40:28.069 --> 00:40:28.079 align:start position:0%
into that that trap uh you know
 
00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:30.180 align:start position:0%
workplace accidents uh
 
00:40:32.690 --> 00:40:32.700 align:start position:0%
let's face it that it's horrible you
 
00:40:34.490 --> 00:40:34.500 align:start position:0%
know uh you know I've I've had to
 
00:40:36.410 --> 00:40:36.420 align:start position:0%
collect workers comp and it's it's no
 
00:40:38.690 --> 00:40:38.700 align:start position:0%
picnic you know being being hurt and
 
00:40:40.910 --> 00:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
laying there in bed and uh you know
 
00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
unable to to uh to earn a living and
 
00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:45.480 align:start position:0%
then come back and you can only do half
 
00:40:47.810 --> 00:40:47.820 align:start position:0%
the job and uh we've got to avoid that
 
00:40:51.770 --> 00:40:51.780 align:start position:0%
at all costs and um you know just
 
00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
I can't I can't put my my stamp of
 
00:40:57.890 --> 00:40:57.900 align:start position:0%
approval on on anything that uh you know
 
00:41:01.490 --> 00:41:01.500 align:start position:0%
it was gonna uh make things worse
 
00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:03.960 align:start position:0%
it was a Bouchard
 
00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
um I just want to focus the idea that
 
00:41:10.970 --> 00:41:10.980 align:start position:0%
this is a medication
 
00:41:12.829 --> 00:41:12.839 align:start position:0%
with a prescription
 
00:41:12.839 --> 00:41:14.569 align:start position:0%
with a prescription
and

00:41:14.569 --> 00:41:14.579 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:41:16.849 --> 00:41:16.859 align:start position:0%
when you follow the prescription you are
 
00:41:18.890 --> 00:41:18.900 align:start position:0%
not impaired
 
00:41:22.010 --> 00:41:22.020 align:start position:0%
and basically what people are discussing
 
00:41:24.410 --> 00:41:24.420 align:start position:0%
about is people who are abusing
 
00:41:28.010 --> 00:41:28.020 align:start position:0%
the drug and that's another issue
 
00:41:30.349 --> 00:41:30.359 align:start position:0%
how I look at this bill is it just
 
00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
addresses that you cannot discriminate
 
00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
against someone
 
00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:37.380 align:start position:0%
for their prescription drug
 
00:41:42.430 --> 00:41:42.440 align:start position:0%
for employment thank you Mr kale
 
00:41:48.370 --> 00:41:48.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:51.660 align:start position:0%
Mike once again representative Bouchard
 
00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
has preempted my discussion
 
00:41:57.410 --> 00:41:57.420 align:start position:0%
I gotta get my hand up faster next time
 
00:41:59.870 --> 00:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
I'll start going Bouchard perfect thank
 
00:42:01.490 --> 00:42:01.500 align:start position:0%
you so much alphabetically and
 
00:42:04.310 --> 00:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
challenged so again yeah the bill does
 
00:42:06.410 --> 00:42:06.420 align:start position:0%
not provide anyone anyone can be
 
00:42:08.089 --> 00:42:08.099 align:start position:0%
impaired on the job
 
00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
and I think if you if you were abusing
 
00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:15.000 align:start position:0%
alcohol or or anything else and you your
 
00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
employer judged you to be impaired that
 
00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:19.020 align:start position:0%
would be grounds for dismissal or
 
00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
certain you know if you show up for an
 
00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
interview and you
 
00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:25.140 align:start position:0%
you uh you're drunk I don't think that
 
00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
prospects are good but it is a
 
00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
medication and I'm gonna we're moving
 
00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:33.240 align:start position:0%
toward legalization so I I think a lot
 
00:42:35.569 --> 00:42:35.579 align:start position:0%
of this testing other than for those
 
00:42:38.329 --> 00:42:38.339 align:start position:0%
positions where we seem to we we agree
 
00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:41.640 align:start position:0%
that uh you know any any degree of uh
 
00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
use of this would pose a risk I think
 
00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
where the tests are going to go away
 
00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:50.700 align:start position:0%
but for now certainly where you have a a
 
00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:52.980 align:start position:0%
prescription because it helps you with
 
00:42:57.050 --> 00:42:57.060 align:start position:0%
pain uh perhaps you want prior injury uh
 
00:42:58.970 --> 00:42:58.980 align:start position:0%
and it helps you get a good night's
 
00:43:00.650 --> 00:43:00.660 align:start position:0%
sleep so that you can function at work
 
00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:03.480 align:start position:0%
and you're not impaired uh I I think
 
00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
this is I think this is something we
 
00:43:06.589 --> 00:43:06.599 align:start position:0%
should pass
 
00:43:06.599 --> 00:43:08.390 align:start position:0%
should pass
like

00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
version of Granger
 
00:43:12.410 --> 00:43:12.420 align:start position:0%
followed by did you
 
00:43:14.210 --> 00:43:14.220 align:start position:0%
um Draco did I see your hand up no
 
00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
representative Granger followed by love
 
00:43:19.309 --> 00:43:19.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker um so this seems
 
00:43:21.050 --> 00:43:21.060 align:start position:0%
like a freedom issue to me
 
00:43:22.490 --> 00:43:22.500 align:start position:0%
um I believe that ultimately I believe
 
00:43:25.130 --> 00:43:25.140 align:start position:0%
in Freedom of Association and so that
 
00:43:26.930 --> 00:43:26.940 align:start position:0%
means that just as somebody has the
 
00:43:28.730 --> 00:43:28.740 align:start position:0%
right to use marijuana if they want
 
00:43:30.829 --> 00:43:30.839 align:start position:0%
someone else has right not to associate
 
00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:33.720 align:start position:0%
with that as a result and you know I I
 
00:43:34.970 --> 00:43:34.980 align:start position:0%
wouldn't just apply this marijuana I'd
 
00:43:37.069 --> 00:43:37.079 align:start position:0%
apply this to any prescription drug and
 
00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
even though it's very unlikely that
 
00:43:39.829 --> 00:43:39.839 align:start position:0%
someone's going to be uh discriminated
 
00:43:41.870 --> 00:43:41.880 align:start position:0%
against for using ibuprofen I believe
 
00:43:43.370 --> 00:43:43.380 align:start position:0%
that that is a right and a freedom that
 
00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:45.060 align:start position:0%
you have the right to do just as it is
 
00:43:47.150 --> 00:43:47.160 align:start position:0%
your right to use ibuprofen and
 
00:43:48.890 --> 00:43:48.900 align:start position:0%
therefore I would uh I would oppose this
 
00:43:51.710 --> 00:43:51.720 align:start position:0%
bill because I'd support the right uh to
 
00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:54.060 align:start position:0%
associate with whomever you please
 
00:43:57.170 --> 00:43:57.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:00.530 --> 00:44:00.540 align:start position:0%
because we we cannot measure any degree
 
00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
of impairment there's there's no tests
 
00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.550 align:start position:0%
of impairment there's there's no tests
available

00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:06.660 align:start position:0%
um you know what I think we'll end up
 
00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
with uh
 
00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
if if there is an accident uh the
 
00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:12.180 align:start position:0%
employer will be sitting there saying
 
00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
you know you were stoned and the
 
00:44:16.490 --> 00:44:16.500 align:start position:0%
employees say no I wasn't yes you were
 
00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
no you weren't uh we're opening a can of
 
00:44:21.109 --> 00:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
worms that we shouldn't be opening
 
00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
um the the employer has to be able to
 
00:44:24.829 --> 00:44:24.839 align:start position:0%
say I don't like your job performance
 
00:44:27.050 --> 00:44:27.060 align:start position:0%
you know since you've been on this stuff
 
00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:28.670 align:start position:0%
you know since you've been on this stuff
uh

00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:44:31.970 --> 00:44:31.980 align:start position:0%
and you know and be able to to let that
 
00:44:34.730 --> 00:44:34.740 align:start position:0%
person go if he has to uh or change it
 
00:44:37.550 --> 00:44:37.560 align:start position:0%
changes occupation uh you know if you if
 
00:44:39.170 --> 00:44:39.180 align:start position:0%
you're making thirty dollars an hour and
 
00:44:41.870 --> 00:44:41.880 align:start position:0%
uh you know your job performance isn't
 
00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:43.260 align:start position:0%
so good and that employer should have
 
00:44:45.470 --> 00:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
the right to at least say you've got to
 
00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:46.740 align:start position:0%
do this job over here and you're only
 
00:44:48.349 --> 00:44:48.359 align:start position:0%
going to get 20.
 
00:44:51.710 --> 00:44:51.720 align:start position:0%
um you know um we we can't be
 
00:44:53.569 --> 00:44:53.579 align:start position:0%
we can't be telling employers how to run
 
00:44:55.970 --> 00:44:55.980 align:start position:0%
the how to run their business uh like
 
00:44:58.069 --> 00:44:58.079 align:start position:0%
that you know the safety issues hit
 
00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
and and in the end this the employer is
 
00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:01.370 align:start position:0%
and and in the end this the employer is
liable

00:45:01.370 --> 00:45:01.380 align:start position:0%
liable
 
00:45:03.349 --> 00:45:03.359 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
representative kale uh thank you Mr
 
00:45:09.829 --> 00:45:09.839 align:start position:0%
chair uh I don't believe the employer is
 
00:45:12.890 --> 00:45:12.900 align:start position:0%
barred from dismissing or disciplining a
 
00:45:14.450 --> 00:45:14.460 align:start position:0%
someone who's a who's negative
 
00:45:16.910 --> 00:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
performance is is you just can't do it
 
00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:17.930 align:start position:0%
performance is is you just can't do it
because

00:45:17.930 --> 00:45:17.940 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
you have a prescription card
 
00:45:25.010 --> 00:45:25.020 align:start position:0%
so if if I'm taking uh Thorazine and uh
 
00:45:26.930 --> 00:45:26.940 align:start position:0%
it's affecting my performance you could
 
00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
still you could still say well this
 
00:45:31.130 --> 00:45:31.140 align:start position:0%
isn't working anymore and if I go to the
 
00:45:33.170 --> 00:45:33.180 align:start position:0%
labor board and you can you tell me you
 
00:45:36.050 --> 00:45:36.060 align:start position:0%
warned me and and that my performance
 
00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
software you cite examples I'm going to
 
00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:38.990 align:start position:0%
software you cite examples I'm going to
lose

00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
lose
 
00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
so it shouldn't be any different there's
 
00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
no I understand about the impairment and
 
00:45:46.069 --> 00:45:46.079 align:start position:0%
as far as the roadside testing and
 
00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
everything but if you're working with
 
00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
someone on a day-to-day basis and you
 
00:45:51.410 --> 00:45:51.420 align:start position:0%
see that they're
 
00:45:54.349 --> 00:45:54.359 align:start position:0%
they seem to be off I I think you have a
 
00:45:56.329 --> 00:45:56.339 align:start position:0%
reasonable presumption that uh this
 
00:45:58.250 --> 00:45:58.260 align:start position:0%
could be a part of it and have a
 
00:46:00.829 --> 00:46:00.839 align:start position:0%
conversation but with the employee if
 
00:46:03.650 --> 00:46:03.660 align:start position:0%
the employee is able to address that and
 
00:46:05.690 --> 00:46:05.700 align:start position:0%
maybe adjust their dosage or the time
 
00:46:09.410 --> 00:46:09.420 align:start position:0%
that they uh take the use the cannabis
 
00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:11.400 align:start position:0%
it can be worked out I think employees
 
00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
are too valuable now that we shouldn't
 
00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:15.780 align:start position:0%
be denying them because of something
 
00:46:17.829 --> 00:46:17.839 align:start position:0%
that they are medically
 
00:46:20.990 --> 00:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
prescribed and I think in again in the
 
00:46:23.450 --> 00:46:23.460 align:start position:0%
future is going to be something that is
 
00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:24.349 align:start position:0%
future is going to be something that is
uh

00:46:24.349 --> 00:46:24.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:46:26.270 --> 00:46:26.280 align:start position:0%
that is there and legal for anybody
 
00:46:29.930 --> 00:46:29.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:32.460 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna I'm gonna I I want to
 
00:46:34.490 --> 00:46:34.500 align:start position:0%
interject at this point I appreciate the
 
00:46:36.050 --> 00:46:36.060 align:start position:0%
the passion
 
00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:36.710 align:start position:0%
the passion
um

00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:39.290 --> 00:46:39.300 align:start position:0%
but we as as I brought up in the
 
00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
executive session we need to get back
 
00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
to we're off on all these tangents about
 
00:46:46.069 --> 00:46:46.079 align:start position:0%
being stoned at work and being this that
 
00:46:47.210 --> 00:46:47.220 align:start position:0%
and the other let's get back to what
 
00:46:49.370 --> 00:46:49.380 align:start position:0%
representative combination of what what
 
00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:51.780 align:start position:0%
the representatives Brian's have to have
 
00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:53.870 align:start position:0%
the representatives Brian's have to have
said

00:46:53.870 --> 00:46:53.880 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:55.309 align:start position:0%
said
um

00:46:55.309 --> 00:46:55.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:58.010 --> 00:46:58.020 align:start position:0%
this as we all know there are rules
 
00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
about discrimination
 
00:47:02.210 --> 00:47:02.220 align:start position:0%
at the workplace we also know that
 
00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
there's this accommodation that can be
 
00:47:06.650 --> 00:47:06.660 align:start position:0%
made if someone has a situation let's
 
00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
just take away drugs for a second okay
 
00:47:11.569 --> 00:47:11.579 align:start position:0%
someone has a stroke someone breaks
 
00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
their legs there's a terrible motorcycle
 
00:47:15.589 --> 00:47:15.599 align:start position:0%
accident breaks their leg okay they can
 
00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
no longer do
 
00:47:19.550 --> 00:47:19.560 align:start position:0%
um what they were doing
 
00:47:21.650 --> 00:47:21.660 align:start position:0%
can the employer make a reasonable
 
00:47:23.569 --> 00:47:23.579 align:start position:0%
accommodation whether it's a certain
 
00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
workstation or a certain chair or a
 
00:47:27.829 --> 00:47:27.839 align:start position:0%
certain whatever to allow that
 
00:47:29.210 --> 00:47:29.220 align:start position:0%
individual to continue to work the
 
00:47:31.010 --> 00:47:31.020 align:start position:0%
federal government has said you must as
 
00:47:32.329 --> 00:47:32.339 align:start position:0%
an employer make a reasonable
 
00:47:32.339 --> 00:47:33.710 align:start position:0%
an employer make a reasonable
accommodation

00:47:33.710 --> 00:47:33.720 align:start position:0%
accommodation
 
00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
okay now
 
00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
what is reasonable well you know all
 
00:47:39.710 --> 00:47:39.720 align:start position:0%
depends it's going to cost me as an
 
00:47:41.569 --> 00:47:41.579 align:start position:0%
employer a thousand dollars to buy you a
 
00:47:43.069 --> 00:47:43.079 align:start position:0%
better workstation where you can stand
 
00:47:44.510 --> 00:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
up and sit down and bring your keyboard
 
00:47:46.309 --> 00:47:46.319 align:start position:0%
up to your chest and do whatever or or
 
00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:50.640 align:start position:0%
work at a on a assembly line and certain
 
00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:51.890 align:start position:0%
work at a on a assembly line and certain
things

00:47:51.890 --> 00:47:51.900 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
um is it going to cost you a thousand
 
00:47:55.010 --> 00:47:55.020 align:start position:0%
dollars to make that a reasonable
 
00:47:56.329 --> 00:47:56.339 align:start position:0%
accommodation or is it going to cost you
 
00:47:58.609 --> 00:47:58.619 align:start position:0%
uh 25 000 to make that reasonable
 
00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
accommodation and then you can discuss
 
00:48:03.650 --> 00:48:03.660 align:start position:0%
whether what is reasonable what is not
 
00:48:05.569 --> 00:48:05.579 align:start position:0%
so this thing came from a situation
 
00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
where we had a Supreme Court ruling and
 
00:48:11.690 --> 00:48:11.700 align:start position:0%
Brian Sullivan is correct uh seaworth is
 
00:48:14.450 --> 00:48:14.460 align:start position:0%
correct this was about reasonable
 
00:48:16.670 --> 00:48:16.680 align:start position:0%
accommodation so let's bring it back
 
00:48:18.550 --> 00:48:18.560 align:start position:0%
down to what this was
 
00:48:21.710 --> 00:48:21.720 align:start position:0%
it a reasonable accommodation
 
00:48:24.170 --> 00:48:24.180 align:start position:0%
to allow this individual to take
 
00:48:26.089 --> 00:48:26.099 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis
 
00:48:28.609 --> 00:48:28.619 align:start position:0%
to be and and to be working and it was
 
00:48:30.650 --> 00:48:30.660 align:start position:0%
about a drug test
 
00:48:32.750 --> 00:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
okay let's bring it back narrow again as
 
00:48:34.010 --> 00:48:34.020 align:start position:0%
to what the Supreme Court ruling it's
 
00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:35.400 align:start position:0%
nice having a Supreme Court Justice
 
00:48:37.370 --> 00:48:37.380 align:start position:0%
former Supreme Court Justice to state
 
00:48:39.050 --> 00:48:39.060 align:start position:0%
representative because I went over the
 
00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
ruling with him so what does it say and
 
00:48:44.589 --> 00:48:44.599 align:start position:0%
what does this doesn't doesn't say okay
 
00:48:47.450 --> 00:48:47.460 align:start position:0%
so following again bring this thing down
 
00:48:48.770 --> 00:48:48.780 align:start position:0%
narrow again
 
00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
it said they must make a reasonable
 
00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:52.069 align:start position:0%
it said they must make a reasonable
accommodation

00:48:52.069 --> 00:48:52.079 align:start position:0%
accommodation
 
00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
okay then you have to go to 126 x
 
00:48:59.030 --> 00:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
okay which is our
 
00:49:01.370 --> 00:49:01.380 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis law
 
00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:04.680 align:start position:0%
okay so you have to look at what it does
 
00:49:07.370 --> 00:49:07.380 align:start position:0%
what it says what it doesn't say and you
 
00:49:10.849 --> 00:49:10.859 align:start position:0%
cannot be under the you you have a so
 
00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
bring it down to the drug test
 
00:49:15.050 --> 00:49:15.060 align:start position:0%
okay I have to provide you a reasonable
 
00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
accommodation and I cannot fire you if
 
00:49:20.450 --> 00:49:20.460 align:start position:0%
you test positive for a drug test it
 
00:49:21.950 --> 00:49:21.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't say you can be under the
 
00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
influence on the job it doesn't say you
 
00:49:26.990 --> 00:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
can have it in your possession
 
00:49:28.790 --> 00:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
in the workplace
 
00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say these things okay so part
 
00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
of the reasonable accommodation
 
00:49:36.770 --> 00:49:36.780 align:start position:0%
from a safety standpoint because you
 
00:49:38.210 --> 00:49:38.220 align:start position:0%
know hey I'm workers comp guy here right
 
00:49:40.130 --> 00:49:40.140 align:start position:0%
you know dream and sleep you know
 
00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
workers comp it's crazy
 
00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:43.069 align:start position:0%
workers comp it's crazy
um

00:49:43.069 --> 00:49:43.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:44.690 --> 00:49:44.700 align:start position:0%
you don't want because the workers
 
00:49:49.010 --> 00:49:49.020 align:start position:0%
compensation can deny a claim
 
00:49:51.650 --> 00:49:51.660 align:start position:0%
if you are impaired
 
00:49:54.410 --> 00:49:54.420 align:start position:0%
if you were drunk
 
00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
um if you are under alcohol trust me
 
00:49:58.370 --> 00:49:58.380 align:start position:0%
I've had case cases where someone got
 
00:49:58.380 --> 00:49:59.809 align:start position:0%
I've had case cases where someone got
killed

00:49:59.809 --> 00:49:59.819 align:start position:0%
killed
 
00:50:02.329 --> 00:50:02.339 align:start position:0%
and boy that drug test was not something
 
00:50:04.069 --> 00:50:04.079 align:start position:0%
anyone wanted to go to court about
 
00:50:06.290 --> 00:50:06.300 align:start position:0%
okay and so
 
00:50:08.809 --> 00:50:08.819 align:start position:0%
bring you down again here you cannot be
 
00:50:10.309 --> 00:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
have it on your pocket you can't be
 
00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
smoking pot at work you can't be under
 
00:50:13.790 --> 00:50:13.800 align:start position:0%
the influence
 
00:50:16.069 --> 00:50:16.079 align:start position:0%
where bring it down to what the Supreme
 
00:50:16.079 --> 00:50:17.150 align:start position:0%
where bring it down to what the Supreme
Court

00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:17.160 align:start position:0%
Court
 
00:50:19.790 --> 00:50:19.800 align:start position:0%
said in their ruling where I disagree
 
00:50:25.550 --> 00:50:25.560 align:start position:0%
with representative Sullivan on this is
 
00:50:27.890 --> 00:50:27.900 align:start position:0%
and I I see where it's coming from and I
 
00:50:29.210 --> 00:50:29.220 align:start position:0%
respect where he's coming from I don't
 
00:50:32.030 --> 00:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
agree in this case
 
00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
you don't want discrimination
 
00:50:37.309 --> 00:50:37.319 align:start position:0%
okay this is about an occurring employee
 
00:50:39.650 --> 00:50:39.660 align:start position:0%
making accommodation this is not about
 
00:50:42.290 --> 00:50:42.300 align:start position:0%
making accommodations or making things
 
00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
for employees that have not been hired
 
00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
yet to allow them to get hired and
 
00:50:48.410 --> 00:50:48.420 align:start position:0%
that's the only place we disagree and
 
00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:50.640 align:start position:0%
representative colcom isn't politics
 
00:50:52.549 --> 00:50:52.559 align:start position:0%
great when you're trying to trying to
 
00:50:52.559 --> 00:50:53.630 align:start position:0%
great when you're trying to trying to
make

00:50:53.630 --> 00:50:53.640 align:start position:0%
make
 
00:50:56.450 --> 00:50:56.460 align:start position:0%
um trying to to make law where you don't
 
00:50:57.950 --> 00:50:57.960 align:start position:0%
want discrimination but we've already
 
00:50:59.930 --> 00:50:59.940 align:start position:0%
discriminated because fire police and
 
00:51:01.010 --> 00:51:01.020 align:start position:0%
emergency because they don't want it
 
00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
they don't want this and they don't want
 
00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
that in their ranks okay so we're gonna
 
00:51:07.549 --> 00:51:07.559 align:start position:0%
we're gonna exclude something
 
00:51:10.069 --> 00:51:10.079 align:start position:0%
so yeah welcome to the world of trying
 
00:51:12.290 --> 00:51:12.300 align:start position:0%
to make a a a bill that works for
 
00:51:14.450 --> 00:51:14.460 align:start position:0%
everybody uh or a law that works for
 
00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:18.720 align:start position:0%
everybody so I would I I wish I you know
 
00:51:21.829 --> 00:51:21.839 align:start position:0%
it isn't I would like to pass a law
 
00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:23.400 align:start position:0%
that is consistent with what the United
 
00:51:25.370 --> 00:51:25.380 align:start position:0%
States New Hampshire Supreme Court said
 
00:51:28.370 --> 00:51:28.380 align:start position:0%
because if we don't we look foolish the
 
00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court has overruled us in their
 
00:51:33.049 --> 00:51:33.059 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction as a judicial branch of our
 
00:51:35.089 --> 00:51:35.099 align:start position:0%
three branches we're the legislative
 
00:51:35.099 --> 00:51:36.230 align:start position:0%
three branches we're the legislative
branch

00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
branch
 
00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:37.849 align:start position:0%
branch
okay

00:51:37.849 --> 00:51:37.859 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:51:40.250 --> 00:51:40.260 align:start position:0%
I don't you know normally we kind of
 
00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:42.180 align:start position:0%
should listen to what they say and kind
 
00:51:44.329 --> 00:51:44.339 align:start position:0%
of bring the law into Conformity I guess
 
00:51:47.390 --> 00:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
we could do the opposite
 
00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
we could look at their ruling
 
00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:53.220 align:start position:0%
and say you're full of full of water
 
00:51:56.210 --> 00:51:56.220 align:start position:0%
we're going to put another bill in
 
00:51:58.490 --> 00:51:58.500 align:start position:0%
that takes away
 
00:52:00.349 --> 00:52:00.359 align:start position:0%
the authority of your ruling and makes
 
00:52:02.089 --> 00:52:02.099 align:start position:0%
it no longer null and void because of a
 
00:52:04.430 --> 00:52:04.440 align:start position:0%
new law not sure we need to do that
 
00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:05.210 align:start position:0%
new law not sure we need to do that
either

00:52:05.210 --> 00:52:05.220 align:start position:0%
either
 
00:52:06.890 --> 00:52:06.900 align:start position:0%
but those are the things in front of us
 
00:52:08.809 --> 00:52:08.819 align:start position:0%
so representative love I respect the
 
00:52:10.609 --> 00:52:10.619 align:start position:0%
fact that you don't want people to be
 
00:52:12.049 --> 00:52:12.059 align:start position:0%
under the influence of work that's not
 
00:52:13.549 --> 00:52:13.559 align:start position:0%
what the bill allows it's about a
 
00:52:15.170 --> 00:52:15.180 align:start position:0%
reasonable accommodation
 
00:52:19.010 --> 00:52:19.020 align:start position:0%
uh and and so I'm happy to have this big
 
00:52:20.809 --> 00:52:20.819 align:start position:0%
broad discussion but just try to bring
 
00:52:22.849 --> 00:52:22.859 align:start position:0%
it back to where it is and I will also
 
00:52:25.130 --> 00:52:25.140 align:start position:0%
say one last thing
 
00:52:27.710 --> 00:52:27.720 align:start position:0%
we are all well aware
 
00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
of what kind of a legislature we have
 
00:52:31.370 --> 00:52:31.380 align:start position:0%
it's a good legislature because it's
 
00:52:33.290 --> 00:52:33.300 align:start position:0%
very close it's very divided so you get
 
00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
the best of all legislation something on
 
00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
either well no something you do some of
 
00:52:39.650 --> 00:52:39.660 align:start position:0%
the stuff on on one way side on that
 
00:52:41.329 --> 00:52:41.339 align:start position:0%
side isn't going to pass on that way
 
00:52:43.490 --> 00:52:43.500 align:start position:0%
side that side's not going to pass all
 
00:52:45.650 --> 00:52:45.660 align:start position:0%
right because we if you don't have the
 
00:52:46.970 --> 00:52:46.980 align:start position:0%
votes if you do have the votes for the
 
00:52:48.890 --> 00:52:48.900 align:start position:0%
house and you got to go to the Senate
 
00:52:51.770 --> 00:52:51.780 align:start position:0%
so if we do pass a bill which I would
 
00:52:53.809 --> 00:52:53.819 align:start position:0%
like to a very narrowly focused Bill
 
00:52:56.390 --> 00:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
based on the Supreme Court based on the
 
00:52:58.130 --> 00:52:58.140 align:start position:0%
accommodations based on all these things
 
00:53:00.049 --> 00:53:00.059 align:start position:0%
I would like to pass something out of
 
00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
the house that's going to pass in the
 
00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:02.210 align:start position:0%
the house that's going to pass in the
Senate

00:53:02.210 --> 00:53:02.220 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
00:53:06.170 --> 00:53:06.180 align:start position:0%
so keep that in mind that uh passing
 
00:53:08.750 --> 00:53:08.760 align:start position:0%
something out of one body that has no
 
00:53:11.390 --> 00:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
chance in the other bodies
 
00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
it makes a point but sometimes it's a
 
00:53:16.730 --> 00:53:16.740 align:start position:0%
waste of time as well so
 
00:53:18.770 --> 00:53:18.780 align:start position:0%
I said
 
00:53:20.750 --> 00:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
very little with too many words but
 
00:53:23.150 --> 00:53:23.160 align:start position:0%
let's kind of keep it narrow and get it
 
00:53:24.829 --> 00:53:24.839 align:start position:0%
back to what the Supreme Court ruling is
 
00:53:27.589 --> 00:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
and um and the accommodation of aspect
 
00:53:29.450 --> 00:53:29.460 align:start position:0%
representative Qualcomm
 
00:53:32.450 --> 00:53:32.460 align:start position:0%
followed by Solomon and love
 
00:53:34.430 --> 00:53:34.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so I would like to
 
00:53:36.589 --> 00:53:36.599 align:start position:0%
share that I am
 
00:53:39.230 --> 00:53:39.240 align:start position:0%
I'm prepared to fully support this bill
 
00:53:41.089 --> 00:53:41.099 align:start position:0%
if we can put an amendment through that
 
00:53:44.210 --> 00:53:44.220 align:start position:0%
takes out just the piece of the new hire
 
00:53:46.250 --> 00:53:46.260 align:start position:0%
and leave everything else as it is but
 
00:53:48.349 --> 00:53:48.359 align:start position:0%
take out the piece of the new hire and I
 
00:53:50.329 --> 00:53:50.339 align:start position:0%
will absolutely compromise and support
 
00:53:52.130 --> 00:53:52.140 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
I agree and I've relayed that to
 
00:53:55.910 --> 00:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan in a very polite
 
00:53:58.210 --> 00:53:58.220 align:start position:0%
and cordial the way he and I always talk
 
00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
on the phone and we haven't had a
 
00:54:02.569 --> 00:54:02.579 align:start position:0%
meeting in the minds yet but I do
 
00:54:04.609 --> 00:54:04.619 align:start position:0%
understand and I support what you're
 
00:54:06.349 --> 00:54:06.359 align:start position:0%
saying representative Sullivan and then
 
00:54:06.359 --> 00:54:08.030 align:start position:0%
saying representative Sullivan and then
low

00:54:08.030 --> 00:54:08.040 align:start position:0%
low
 
00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
and and I do respect the perspective of
 
00:54:15.710 --> 00:54:15.720 align:start position:0%
my Republican uh friends
 
00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:16.790 align:start position:0%
my Republican uh friends
um

00:54:16.790 --> 00:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:19.390 --> 00:54:19.400 align:start position:0%
with regard to the Supreme Court uh case
 
00:54:22.670 --> 00:54:22.680 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court case dealt with the
 
00:54:24.730 --> 00:54:24.740 align:start position:0%
um the specific
 
00:54:29.089 --> 00:54:29.099 align:start position:0%
facts of a single case that individual
 
00:54:31.910 --> 00:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
happened to be employed at the time that
 
00:54:34.910 --> 00:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
the issue arose that's why the Supreme
 
00:54:37.990 --> 00:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
Court only dealt with currently employed
 
00:54:41.870 --> 00:54:41.880 align:start position:0%
individuals they never liked to broaden
 
00:54:44.270 --> 00:54:44.280 align:start position:0%
the decision to cover all kinds of other
 
00:54:47.049 --> 00:54:47.059 align:start position:0%
issues that aren't presently before them
 
00:54:50.690 --> 00:54:50.700 align:start position:0%
I would anticipate that if there is a
 
00:54:53.089 --> 00:54:53.099 align:start position:0%
new case where someone was discriminated
 
00:54:55.390 --> 00:54:55.400 align:start position:0%
against at the point point of higher
 
00:54:57.710 --> 00:54:57.720 align:start position:0%
because solely because they have a
 
00:55:00.109 --> 00:55:00.119 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis card I think they
 
00:55:02.710 --> 00:55:02.720 align:start position:0%
would also say that's not okay either
 
00:55:05.990 --> 00:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
but I agree this Supreme Court case
 
00:55:08.809 --> 00:55:08.819 align:start position:0%
doesn't deal with that issue but I
 
00:55:11.210 --> 00:55:11.220 align:start position:0%
believe this bill should
 
00:55:13.010 --> 00:55:13.020 align:start position:0%
um so um
 
00:55:14.750 --> 00:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
you know it
 
00:55:17.569 --> 00:55:17.579 align:start position:0%
just Supreme Court cases don't
 
00:55:20.569 --> 00:55:20.579 align:start position:0%
necessarily Drive legislation it
 
00:55:22.849 --> 00:55:22.859 align:start position:0%
justifies this legislation just to a
 
00:55:26.809 --> 00:55:26.819 align:start position:0%
certain degree but I I continue to
 
00:55:29.510 --> 00:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
believe that this ought to cover people
 
00:55:32.089 --> 00:55:32.099 align:start position:0%
at the point of higher and during the
 
00:55:34.430 --> 00:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
course of employment thank you
 
00:55:36.170 --> 00:55:36.180 align:start position:0%
representative love followed by Sullivan
 
00:55:38.430 --> 00:55:38.440 align:start position:0%
uh seaworth why am I doing that
 
00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:40.609 align:start position:0%
uh seaworth why am I doing that
[Laughter]

00:55:40.609 --> 00:55:40.619 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:55:41.930 --> 00:55:41.940 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:55:41.940 --> 00:55:44.150 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:46.190 --> 00:55:46.200 align:start position:0%
just like representative kolkum you know
 
00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
I I I I I don't like the idea of uh you
 
00:55:53.870 --> 00:55:53.880 align:start position:0%
know the the government jumping into who
 
00:55:55.490 --> 00:55:55.500 align:start position:0%
you can hire and who you can't you know
 
00:55:57.589 --> 00:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
and who you can refuse to hide
 
00:56:00.829 --> 00:56:00.839 align:start position:0%
um also the the Supreme Court ruling
 
00:56:03.049 --> 00:56:03.059 align:start position:0%
doesn't get it it doesn't give the the
 
00:56:05.210 --> 00:56:05.220 align:start position:0%
employer any rights at all
 
00:56:06.770 --> 00:56:06.780 align:start position:0%
um you know it more or less takes away
 
00:56:10.609 --> 00:56:10.619 align:start position:0%
uh if if an amendment uh came forth that
 
00:56:14.809 --> 00:56:14.819 align:start position:0%
would uh allow an employer to uh to say
 
00:56:16.910 --> 00:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
okay you can't do this job
 
00:56:18.829 --> 00:56:18.839 align:start position:0%
but you can do this one and you're going
 
00:56:20.210 --> 00:56:20.220 align:start position:0%
to get ten dollars an hour less or
 
00:56:22.970 --> 00:56:22.980 align:start position:0%
whatever uh you know uh give the
 
00:56:25.250 --> 00:56:25.260 align:start position:0%
employer back some a little a little
 
00:56:28.190 --> 00:56:28.200 align:start position:0%
power in this uh because once again if
 
00:56:31.970 --> 00:56:31.980 align:start position:0%
if somebody's uh even a little bit
 
00:56:34.790 --> 00:56:34.800 align:start position:0%
uh you know stoned don't choose the word
 
00:56:37.370 --> 00:56:37.380 align:start position:0%
what it is I um you know it could affect
 
00:56:39.829 --> 00:56:39.839 align:start position:0%
you know the the job safety of many
 
00:56:43.010 --> 00:56:43.020 align:start position:0%
and um if uh if somebody's operating say
 
00:56:45.410 --> 00:56:45.420 align:start position:0%
a forklift operator in a warehouse okay
 
00:56:47.870 --> 00:56:47.880 align:start position:0%
uh you know you don't want somebody
 
00:56:50.690 --> 00:56:50.700 align:start position:0%
that's impaired and um you know so now
 
00:56:52.309 --> 00:56:52.319 align:start position:0%
you give them a broom and say here clean
 
00:56:53.930 --> 00:56:53.940 align:start position:0%
the place but you're not going to get
 
00:56:56.329 --> 00:56:56.339 align:start position:0%
that wage shoot uh if we had if we had
 
00:56:58.970 --> 00:56:58.980 align:start position:0%
an amendment to do that I'd be okay
 
00:57:01.190 --> 00:57:01.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative C
 
00:57:04.849 --> 00:57:04.859 align:start position:0%
worth thank you Mr chairman uh
 
00:57:08.809 --> 00:57:08.819 align:start position:0%
my fellow Brian brought up a point
 
00:57:11.030 --> 00:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
um about Supreme Court rulings in the
 
00:57:12.290 --> 00:57:12.300 align:start position:0%
law that
 
00:57:15.410 --> 00:57:15.420 align:start position:0%
uh I haven't worked on another committee
 
00:57:18.049 --> 00:57:18.059 align:start position:0%
besides labor but to me it seems like
 
00:57:21.710 --> 00:57:21.720 align:start position:0%
labor in some ways is different and
 
00:57:25.390 --> 00:57:25.400 align:start position:0%
that's part of the reason why
 
00:57:29.390 --> 00:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
this bill was bought forward and part of
 
00:57:34.010 --> 00:57:34.020 align:start position:0%
the reason why it is necessary to
 
00:57:37.190 --> 00:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
um have us align with what the Supreme
 
00:57:41.089 --> 00:57:41.099 align:start position:0%
Court already said is the difference in
 
00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
what would happen right now if someone
 
00:57:46.490 --> 00:57:46.500 align:start position:0%
violates the Supreme Court an employer
 
00:57:49.010 --> 00:57:49.020 align:start position:0%
violates the Supreme Court ruling the
 
00:57:51.950 --> 00:57:51.960 align:start position:0%
employee can take that case to court and
 
00:57:55.069 --> 00:57:55.079 align:start position:0%
almost certainly any Court will use the
 
00:57:57.049 --> 00:57:57.059 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court ruling as president
 
00:57:59.630 --> 00:57:59.640 align:start position:0%
what they can't do is go to the labor
 
00:58:02.270 --> 00:58:02.280 align:start position:0%
department who follows the laws that we
 
00:58:05.990 --> 00:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
write for them so to me the importance
 
00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:07.790 align:start position:0%
write for them so to me the importance
of

00:58:07.790 --> 00:58:07.800 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:58:12.589 --> 00:58:12.599 align:start position:0%
uh backing a Supreme Court ruling might
 
00:58:16.010 --> 00:58:16.020 align:start position:0%
be more uh in in this committee than
 
00:58:18.829 --> 00:58:18.839 align:start position:0%
some other committees and that's so that
 
00:58:21.650 --> 00:58:21.660 align:start position:0%
future employees who find themselves in
 
00:58:25.069 --> 00:58:25.079 align:start position:0%
the same boat and would have a case in
 
00:58:28.069 --> 00:58:28.079 align:start position:0%
the courts don't have to undergo that
 
00:58:30.589 --> 00:58:30.599 align:start position:0%
expense because we've told the labor
 
00:58:30.599 --> 00:58:32.210 align:start position:0%
expense because we've told the labor
department

00:58:32.210 --> 00:58:32.220 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:58:35.030 --> 00:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
to follow the same rules that the courts
 
00:58:37.730 --> 00:58:37.740 align:start position:0%
would and that's neither that's not an
 
00:58:39.770 --> 00:58:39.780 align:start position:0%
argument to put more or less or take
 
00:58:42.770 --> 00:58:42.780 align:start position:0%
something out but I to me that was an
 
00:58:42.780 --> 00:58:43.730 align:start position:0%
something out but I to me that was an
important

00:58:43.730 --> 00:58:43.740 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:58:46.849 --> 00:58:46.859 align:start position:0%
message about what we're trying to do
 
00:58:49.190 --> 00:58:49.200 align:start position:0%
here with this bill
 
00:58:51.890 --> 00:58:51.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:59.089 --> 00:58:59.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
put all the respect to my colleague uh
 
00:59:05.349 --> 00:59:05.359 align:start position:0%
representative love uh I I object to the
 
00:59:08.270 --> 00:59:08.280 align:start position:0%
characterization of people on medical
 
00:59:12.890 --> 00:59:12.900 align:start position:0%
marijuana or stoned uh it is a term that
 
00:59:15.049 --> 00:59:15.059 align:start position:0%
is used to um
 
00:59:17.690 --> 00:59:17.700 align:start position:0%
you know to suggest that somebody is is
 
00:59:19.849 --> 00:59:19.859 align:start position:0%
impaired and that's not necessarily the
 
00:59:19.859 --> 00:59:21.109 align:start position:0%
impaired and that's not necessarily the
case

00:59:21.109 --> 00:59:21.119 align:start position:0%
case
 
00:59:26.390 --> 00:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
let me also say uh TV just a tad is that
 
00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
Miracle Medical Marijuana will be
 
00:59:31.609 --> 00:59:31.619 align:start position:0%
introduced uh in the workers comp
 
00:59:31.619 --> 00:59:32.990 align:start position:0%
introduced uh in the workers comp
environment

00:59:32.990 --> 00:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
environment
 
00:59:34.490 --> 00:59:34.500 align:start position:0%
No Doubt
 
00:59:38.030 --> 00:59:38.040 align:start position:0%
it'll be used as part of a cocktail
 
00:59:41.329 --> 00:59:41.339 align:start position:0%
um of therapy that is be available to
 
00:59:44.690 --> 00:59:44.700 align:start position:0%
people uh to return them to work it
 
00:59:47.809 --> 00:59:47.819 align:start position:0%
already is and so the idea that somebody
 
00:59:50.990 --> 00:59:51.000 align:start position:0%
can't get in the door and no disrespect
 
00:59:53.569 --> 00:59:53.579 align:start position:0%
you uh representative but the idea they
 
00:59:55.069 --> 00:59:55.079 align:start position:0%
can't get in the door
 
00:59:58.490 --> 00:59:58.500 align:start position:0%
but they can use these kinds of um this
 
01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:02.640 align:start position:0%
kind of uh therapy to return to work and
 
01:00:04.490 --> 01:00:04.500 align:start position:0%
in fact save the employer considerable
 
01:00:05.930 --> 01:00:05.940 align:start position:0%
amount of money because they've been
 
01:00:08.270 --> 01:00:08.280 align:start position:0%
able to go back to work so I think this
 
01:00:11.569 --> 01:00:11.579 align:start position:0%
has I I think when we look at at medical
 
01:00:13.309 --> 01:00:13.319 align:start position:0%
marijuana we need to do it in the
 
01:00:17.690 --> 01:00:17.700 align:start position:0%
context of it is a therapy it is a part
 
01:00:19.609 --> 01:00:19.619 align:start position:0%
of a therapy and for those who are
 
01:00:21.170 --> 01:00:21.180 align:start position:0%
injured or those who are trying to
 
01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
maintain a good life uh I I think it's
 
01:00:28.010 --> 01:00:28.020 align:start position:0%
it has a place uh in in this uh in this
 
01:00:28.910 --> 01:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
and I
 
01:00:31.490 --> 01:00:31.500 align:start position:0%
you know I support the concept of it and
 
01:00:33.289 --> 01:00:33.299 align:start position:0%
let me say this I you know I was a
 
01:00:35.210 --> 01:00:35.220 align:start position:0%
firefighter and a captain for a long
 
01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
time I dealt with a whole lot of people
 
01:00:39.530 --> 01:00:39.540 align:start position:0%
over the course of my time
 
01:00:41.930 --> 01:00:41.940 align:start position:0%
and if somebody was impaired they were
 
01:00:43.010 --> 01:00:43.020 align:start position:0%
going home
 
01:00:45.710 --> 01:00:45.720 align:start position:0%
that was it and you know they're
 
01:00:48.349 --> 01:00:48.359 align:start position:0%
impaired uh if you if you're attentive
 
01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
to what's going on as an officer or as a
 
01:00:53.329 --> 01:00:53.339 align:start position:0%
manager you know they're impaired
 
01:00:55.309 --> 01:00:55.319 align:start position:0%
but I never took I never went to a
 
01:00:57.890 --> 01:00:57.900 align:start position:0%
firefighter the day walked in the door
 
01:00:59.870 --> 01:00:59.880 align:start position:0%
and said by the way I think you could be
 
01:01:02.450 --> 01:01:02.460 align:start position:0%
in PH you might possibly be impaired at
 
01:01:04.730 --> 01:01:04.740 align:start position:0%
some point down the line I took it based
 
01:01:07.490 --> 01:01:07.500 align:start position:0%
on what I observed as a manager in a in
 
01:01:10.849 --> 01:01:10.859 align:start position:0%
a in a department so I think it really
 
01:01:13.789 --> 01:01:13.799 align:start position:0%
turns on impairment and to borrow
 
01:01:16.309 --> 01:01:16.319 align:start position:0%
somebody from the beginning of their
 
01:01:19.250 --> 01:01:19.260 align:start position:0%
career to take that away from them to
 
01:01:21.650 --> 01:01:21.660 align:start position:0%
deny them that opportunity to be able to
 
01:01:26.569 --> 01:01:26.579 align:start position:0%
be employed in various uh occupations I
 
01:01:28.069 --> 01:01:28.079 align:start position:0%
think it's harsh
 
01:01:30.289 --> 01:01:30.299 align:start position:0%
and and I think in the context of where
 
01:01:32.750 --> 01:01:32.760 align:start position:0%
we are with this treatment program and
 
01:01:34.549 --> 01:01:34.559 align:start position:0%
the fact that the state is recognizes
 
01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
that it is part of a program of uh of
 
01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
restoring people to uh to normalcy and
 
01:01:42.890 --> 01:01:42.900 align:start position:0%
getting him back to work and getting him
 
01:01:44.390 --> 01:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
in a position where they can function
 
01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:45.650 align:start position:0%
in a position where they can function
well

01:01:45.650 --> 01:01:45.660 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:01:48.230 --> 01:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
um so I I would disagree respectfully
 
01:01:50.990 --> 01:01:51.000 align:start position:0%
with my colleagues uh and i would
 
01:01:53.870 --> 01:01:53.880 align:start position:0%
support this legislation Mr chairman
 
01:01:55.849 --> 01:01:55.859 align:start position:0%
from Joseph Cahill you short enough I'm
 
01:01:56.990 --> 01:01:57.000 align:start position:0%
going to get you before Bouchard
 
01:02:00.289 --> 01:02:00.299 align:start position:0%
representative Cahill qualified
 
01:02:03.890 --> 01:02:03.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh again I imagine
 
01:02:08.030 --> 01:02:08.040 align:start position:0%
that you know you have a job and uh
 
01:02:09.710 --> 01:02:09.720 align:start position:0%
you're injured at the job you get
 
01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
Workers Comp and then for whatever
 
01:02:14.089 --> 01:02:14.099 align:start position:0%
reason you leave the job so now you have
 
01:02:16.370 --> 01:02:16.380 align:start position:0%
a medical marijuana card
 
01:02:18.890 --> 01:02:18.900 align:start position:0%
and you're applying for a job and you
 
01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
can't get it because you have because
 
01:02:23.569 --> 01:02:23.579 align:start position:0%
you're going to fail the test
 
01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
I don't think we want that
 
01:02:28.849 --> 01:02:28.859 align:start position:0%
so I I mean I again as I said earlier I
 
01:02:30.609 --> 01:02:30.619 align:start position:0%
I think the testing is going to go away
 
01:02:33.829 --> 01:02:33.839 align:start position:0%
in unless it's the situation where it is
 
01:02:36.950 --> 01:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
a real real potential risk
 
01:02:40.010 --> 01:02:40.020 align:start position:0%
so I think we could pass the bill
 
01:02:42.890 --> 01:02:42.900 align:start position:0%
you know with this amendment that uh
 
01:02:45.589 --> 01:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
two zero two three oh seven eight five H
 
01:02:47.630 --> 01:02:47.640 align:start position:0%
and be done with it
 
01:02:50.089 --> 01:02:50.099 align:start position:0%
in anticipation of us of a Supreme Court
 
01:02:52.609 --> 01:02:52.619 align:start position:0%
ruling if it should come to pass I think
 
01:02:56.569 --> 01:02:56.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:58.609 --> 01:02:58.619 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:03:00.650 --> 01:03:00.660 align:start position:0%
um I just would like to respond to the
 
01:03:03.230 --> 01:03:03.240 align:start position:0%
comments since my name was brought up I
 
01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
don't I don't disagree with a lot of
 
01:03:07.190 --> 01:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
what you're saying
 
01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:08.270 align:start position:0%
what you're saying
um

01:03:08.270 --> 01:03:08.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:10.670 --> 01:03:10.680 align:start position:0%
when an employer has a group of
 
01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:12.109 align:start position:0%
when an employer has a group of
employees

01:03:12.109 --> 01:03:12.119 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:03:14.030 --> 01:03:14.040 align:start position:0%
they've learned what their work ethics
 
01:03:15.710 --> 01:03:15.720 align:start position:0%
like what their skills are like what
 
01:03:17.390 --> 01:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
their safety practices are like and
 
01:03:19.309 --> 01:03:19.319 align:start position:0%
everything else there's a known entity
 
01:03:22.370 --> 01:03:22.380 align:start position:0%
there and if somebody gets injured or
 
01:03:24.049 --> 01:03:24.059 align:start position:0%
somebody has to go into therapeutic
 
01:03:26.630 --> 01:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
cannabis they have some basis to measure
 
01:03:28.670 --> 01:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
their performance on whether or not it's
 
01:03:30.950 --> 01:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
been affected they have a relationship
 
01:03:32.510 --> 01:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
there that they may be willing to
 
01:03:34.789 --> 01:03:34.799 align:start position:0%
accommodate based off of the
 
01:03:36.829 --> 01:03:36.839 align:start position:0%
circumstances of the employment many
 
01:03:39.170 --> 01:03:39.180 align:start position:0%
factors can come into place
 
01:03:41.630 --> 01:03:41.640 align:start position:0%
with regard to a new hire you're going
 
01:03:42.829 --> 01:03:42.839 align:start position:0%
on good faith through an interview
 
01:03:45.829 --> 01:03:45.839 align:start position:0%
process that maybe goes as long as three
 
01:03:47.450 --> 01:03:47.460 align:start position:0%
hours when you consider the different
 
01:03:49.190 --> 01:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
people that may be involved in the
 
01:03:51.950 --> 01:03:51.960 align:start position:0%
interview process so there is no there's
 
01:03:55.010 --> 01:03:55.020 align:start position:0%
no known Benchmark there's it's all in
 
01:03:56.210 --> 01:03:56.220 align:start position:0%
good faith it's all in what this
 
01:03:58.730 --> 01:03:58.740 align:start position:0%
person's it is coming forward with and
 
01:04:01.430 --> 01:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
of course we all you know make ourselves
 
01:04:03.170 --> 01:04:03.180 align:start position:0%
sound much better than we actually are
 
01:04:04.730 --> 01:04:04.740 align:start position:0%
we fake it till we make it when we get
 
01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
that new job that's been known for Years
 
01:04:09.410 --> 01:04:09.420 align:start position:0%
everybody comes in that way
 
01:04:11.630 --> 01:04:11.640 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying that the employee that
 
01:04:13.069 --> 01:04:13.079 align:start position:0%
we're writing a law that says the
 
01:04:16.849 --> 01:04:16.859 align:start position:0%
employers must not hire I'm saying that
 
01:04:19.370 --> 01:04:19.380 align:start position:0%
I don't want to tie their hands and to
 
01:04:22.069 --> 01:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
take that option away from them based on
 
01:04:24.530 --> 01:04:24.540 align:start position:0%
the risk factors of the jobs that they
 
01:04:25.609 --> 01:04:25.619 align:start position:0%
have available
 
01:04:28.130 --> 01:04:28.140 align:start position:0%
if I have an administrative job that is
 
01:04:30.710 --> 01:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
low risk my workers comp or on that
 
01:04:33.530 --> 01:04:33.540 align:start position:0%
person's safety I may say you know what
 
01:04:36.289 --> 01:04:36.299 align:start position:0%
I'm okay I'm going to take this risk
 
01:04:38.510 --> 01:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
but when I have a job
 
01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:40.319 align:start position:0%
with an electrician who's dealing with
 
01:04:43.370 --> 01:04:43.380 align:start position:0%
high voltage or a crane operator well
 
01:04:45.170 --> 01:04:45.180 align:start position:0%
they may need a federal again it's a
 
01:04:46.609 --> 01:04:46.619 align:start position:0%
this is still a federal offense
 
01:04:48.530 --> 01:04:48.540 align:start position:0%
marijuana is still not legal at the
 
01:04:49.970 --> 01:04:49.980 align:start position:0%
federal level so we can't even have a
 
01:04:52.849 --> 01:04:52.859 align:start position:0%
crane operator an HVAC technician who is
 
01:04:55.069 --> 01:04:55.079 align:start position:0%
working on roofs and also working in
 
01:04:57.230 --> 01:04:57.240 align:start position:0%
high voltage equipment that may be a
 
01:04:59.270 --> 01:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
risk I don't want to take because I want
 
01:05:00.890 --> 01:05:00.900 align:start position:0%
that employee to go home at the end of
 
01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
the day to his family
 
01:05:07.190 --> 01:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
so I am just saying that I don't want to
 
01:05:09.710 --> 01:05:09.720 align:start position:0%
tie the employer's hand I want to leave
 
01:05:12.530 --> 01:05:12.540 align:start position:0%
it to their discretion at the new hire
 
01:05:15.770 --> 01:05:15.780 align:start position:0%
process because the new hire process
 
01:05:18.349 --> 01:05:18.359 align:start position:0%
is still all in good faith based off of
 
01:05:20.569 --> 01:05:20.579 align:start position:0%
an interview process where we all put
 
01:05:22.609 --> 01:05:22.619 align:start position:0%
our best foot forward
 
01:05:25.549 --> 01:05:25.559 align:start position:0%
everything else if they're working there
 
01:05:27.230 --> 01:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
and and they go into therapeutic
 
01:05:30.049 --> 01:05:30.059 align:start position:0%
cannabis all that stuff comes out that's
 
01:05:31.609 --> 01:05:31.619 align:start position:0%
something that's already a relationship
 
01:05:34.609 --> 01:05:34.619 align:start position:0%
built with that employer and employee
 
01:05:36.349 --> 01:05:36.359 align:start position:0%
of Granger
 
01:05:38.510 --> 01:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you so going off of that
 
01:05:40.010 --> 01:05:40.020 align:start position:0%
considering that the unemployment rate
 
01:05:43.370 --> 01:05:43.380 align:start position:0%
is incredibly low If an employer is
 
01:05:44.930 --> 01:05:44.940 align:start position:0%
discriminating based on whether or not
 
01:05:48.289 --> 01:05:48.299 align:start position:0%
someone is uh prescribed to marijuana or
 
01:05:51.049 --> 01:05:51.059 align:start position:0%
has a medical cannabis card then that's
 
01:05:53.150 --> 01:05:53.160 align:start position:0%
their loss I don't see how we need to
 
01:05:54.710 --> 01:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
add to the pile by saying oh it's
 
01:05:56.829 --> 01:05:56.839 align:start position:0%
illegal to discriminate in that manner
 
01:05:59.089 --> 01:05:59.099 align:start position:0%
they're losing out on a potentially good
 
01:06:01.309 --> 01:06:01.319 align:start position:0%
employee if all that you guys are saying
 
01:06:03.650 --> 01:06:03.660 align:start position:0%
is true that this person is you know
 
01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
totally capable of doing doing the job
 
01:06:08.150 --> 01:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
they're not a workplace liability
 
01:06:10.069 --> 01:06:10.079 align:start position:0%
because they're not abusing the drug
 
01:06:12.589 --> 01:06:12.599 align:start position:0%
they're merely using it okay then the
 
01:06:15.049 --> 01:06:15.059 align:start position:0%
punishment in the market for not hiring
 
01:06:16.430 --> 01:06:16.440 align:start position:0%
that person is you don't have a good
 
01:06:18.770 --> 01:06:18.780 align:start position:0%
employee it doesn't make any sense to
 
01:06:20.390 --> 01:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
pile onto that and say well now we're
 
01:06:22.370 --> 01:06:22.380 align:start position:0%
going to have uh discrimination laws
 
01:06:24.470 --> 01:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
that prevent you from making a wise
 
01:06:27.529 --> 01:06:27.539 align:start position:0%
Sound Decision as your best capable of
 
01:06:29.870 --> 01:06:29.880 align:start position:0%
making such decision that just doesn't
 
01:06:31.970 --> 01:06:31.980 align:start position:0%
make any sense yeah you need to allow
 
01:06:33.650 --> 01:06:33.660 align:start position:0%
people to make their own choices you
 
01:06:35.150 --> 01:06:35.160 align:start position:0%
need to allow people to be free to just
 
01:06:36.829 --> 01:06:36.839 align:start position:0%
decide to do whatever they're going do
 
01:06:38.329 --> 01:06:38.339 align:start position:0%
and if it's a mistake that's their
 
01:06:40.010 --> 01:06:40.020 align:start position:0%
mistake we all have the right to make
 
01:06:40.020 --> 01:06:41.870 align:start position:0%
mistake we all have the right to make
mistakes

01:06:41.870 --> 01:06:41.880 align:start position:0%
mistakes
 
01:06:44.029 --> 01:06:44.039 align:start position:0%
yeah my dad told me I made a lot um
 
01:06:46.609 --> 01:06:46.619 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan in just a point
 
01:06:47.510 --> 01:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
of order
 
01:06:49.430 --> 01:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
um it's been a long time since we had
 
01:06:51.470 --> 01:06:51.480 align:start position:0%
the executive session on uh this bill
 
01:06:54.349 --> 01:06:54.359 align:start position:0%
and um I had to look myself to figure
 
01:06:57.289 --> 01:06:57.299 align:start position:0%
out what's the status of this bill we've
 
01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
had um three votes so far on on this one
 
01:07:03.529 --> 01:07:03.539 align:start position:0%
the first was to pass the amendment so
 
01:07:05.750 --> 01:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
the amendment is passed
 
01:07:07.490 --> 01:07:07.500 align:start position:0%
um the one that representative Cahill
 
01:07:10.730 --> 01:07:10.740 align:start position:0%
mentioned has passed the committee we
 
01:07:13.309 --> 01:07:13.319 align:start position:0%
have also had a 10 to 10 vote on otpa
 
01:07:16.789 --> 01:07:16.799 align:start position:0%
and we've also had a 16-4 vote on retain
 
01:07:16.799 --> 01:07:18.589 align:start position:0%
and we've also had a 16-4 vote on retain
so

01:07:18.589 --> 01:07:18.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:07:18.599 --> 01:07:19.970 align:start position:0%
so
just

01:07:19.970 --> 01:07:19.980 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:07:21.950 --> 01:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
as we come back together we've got to
 
01:07:23.470 --> 01:07:23.480 align:start position:0%
finish the process
 
01:07:25.789 --> 01:07:25.799 align:start position:0%
the amendment doesn't need to be voted
 
01:07:27.890 --> 01:07:27.900 align:start position:0%
on again we've passed it already so
 
01:07:30.829 --> 01:07:30.839 align:start position:0%
that's that's where we're at so far
 
01:07:33.950 --> 01:07:33.960 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna make some comments this moment
 
01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:36.109 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna make some comments this moment
please

01:07:36.109 --> 01:07:36.119 align:start position:0%
please
 
01:07:38.089 --> 01:07:38.099 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court of New Hampshire has
 
01:07:40.849 --> 01:07:40.859 align:start position:0%
also stated that
 
01:07:44.690 --> 01:07:44.700 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:44.700 --> 01:07:45.589 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:07:45.589 --> 01:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:48.529 --> 01:07:48.539 align:start position:0%
sword I'm not gonna not diagnosis uh
 
01:07:49.970 --> 01:07:49.980 align:start position:0%
the treatment
 
01:07:54.049 --> 01:07:54.059 align:start position:0%
or workplace injuries can be a doctor
 
01:07:57.170 --> 01:07:57.180 align:start position:0%
can prescribe medical marijuana okay
 
01:07:59.750 --> 01:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
insurance companies do have to if a
 
01:08:01.849 --> 01:08:01.859 align:start position:0%
doctor prescribes it insurance companies
 
01:08:03.470 --> 01:08:03.480 align:start position:0%
do have to pay for it so that's also
 
01:08:05.029 --> 01:08:05.039 align:start position:0%
something that's been passed
 
01:08:07.490 --> 01:08:07.500 align:start position:0%
marijuana is a
 
01:08:09.770 --> 01:08:09.780 align:start position:0%
part of our environment
 
01:08:11.750 --> 01:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
I went to a concert last night so I'm
 
01:08:13.490 --> 01:08:13.500 align:start position:0%
sure with the people around me I'm sure
 
01:08:15.109 --> 01:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
I probably test positive right now
 
01:08:15.119 --> 01:08:17.030 align:start position:0%
I probably test positive right now
somewhere

01:08:17.030 --> 01:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
01:08:22.130 --> 01:08:22.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:24.410 --> 01:08:24.420 align:start position:0%
employers have to make
 
01:08:29.030 --> 01:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:31.849 --> 01:08:31.859 align:start position:0%
the employers that I deal with will tell
 
01:08:34.130 --> 01:08:34.140 align:start position:0%
me right now if they drug test
 
01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
their employees they would lose half
 
01:08:38.510 --> 01:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
their employees
 
01:08:40.729 --> 01:08:40.739 align:start position:0%
many many of them are taking marijuana
 
01:08:43.309 --> 01:08:43.319 align:start position:0%
out of the out of the
 
01:08:43.319 --> 01:08:47.229 align:start position:0%
out of the out of the
uh

01:08:47.229 --> 01:08:47.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:50.329 --> 01:08:50.339 align:start position:0%
off of the
 
01:08:53.329 --> 01:08:53.339 align:start position:0%
um the not good list I mean it has to be
 
01:08:55.789 --> 01:08:55.799 align:start position:0%
past marijuana it has to be an opioid of
 
01:08:57.709 --> 01:08:57.719 align:start position:0%
cocaine has to be something else
 
01:08:59.209 --> 01:08:59.219 align:start position:0%
before they're not going to hire someone
 
01:09:01.370 --> 01:09:01.380 align:start position:0%
so they were kind of the the bar has
 
01:09:03.650 --> 01:09:03.660 align:start position:0%
been been moved and people don't even
 
01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
consider the marijuana anymore
 
01:09:09.410 --> 01:09:09.420 align:start position:0%
so we are in an environment that's
 
01:09:11.570 --> 01:09:11.580 align:start position:0%
changing we all understand that
 
01:09:14.390 --> 01:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
okay and and we're trying to figure out
 
01:09:16.729 --> 01:09:16.739 align:start position:0%
these laws with this in new environment
 
01:09:19.130 --> 01:09:19.140 align:start position:0%
and I don't think anyone around here
 
01:09:21.530 --> 01:09:21.540 align:start position:0%
I think we all agree that there are
 
01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:24.420 align:start position:0%
certain very positive medicinal purposes
 
01:09:27.169 --> 01:09:27.179 align:start position:0%
uh for marijuana the Native Americans
 
01:09:28.910 --> 01:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
knew something that we didn't a long
 
01:09:30.709 --> 01:09:30.719 align:start position:0%
time ago
 
01:09:32.749 --> 01:09:32.759 align:start position:0%
um and um
 
01:09:32.759 --> 01:09:34.370 align:start position:0%
um and um
so

01:09:34.370 --> 01:09:34.380 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
and I only said that because they are
 
01:09:37.669 --> 01:09:37.679 align:start position:0%
the ones that kind of you know kind of
 
01:09:39.169 --> 01:09:39.179 align:start position:0%
grew wild in the wild in the west so
 
01:09:39.179 --> 01:09:40.789 align:start position:0%
grew wild in the wild in the west so
anyway

01:09:40.789 --> 01:09:40.799 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
um they the um so I understand this all
 
01:09:46.610 --> 01:09:46.620 align:start position:0%
these different things that we're trying
 
01:09:51.349 --> 01:09:51.359 align:start position:0%
to take from society and safety and this
 
01:09:54.470 --> 01:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
new realm of of therapeutic
 
01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:55.189 align:start position:0%
new realm of of therapeutic
um

01:09:55.189 --> 01:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:55.199 --> 01:09:56.750 align:start position:0%
um
uses

01:09:56.750 --> 01:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
uses
 
01:09:58.850 --> 01:09:58.860 align:start position:0%
and all the great things that it can do
 
01:10:01.370 --> 01:10:01.380 align:start position:0%
for you and and I and I I understand the
 
01:10:03.169 --> 01:10:03.179 align:start position:0%
struggle here
 
01:10:03.179 --> 01:10:04.010 align:start position:0%
struggle here
um

01:10:04.010 --> 01:10:04.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:04.020 --> 01:10:05.270 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:10:10.070 --> 01:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:13.490 --> 01:10:13.500 align:start position:0%
something and try to expand it out past
 
01:10:15.890 --> 01:10:15.900 align:start position:0%
what it is over the years in this
 
01:10:19.250 --> 01:10:19.260 align:start position:0%
committee we have seen legislation don't
 
01:10:21.470 --> 01:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
check the box okay no longer have a
 
01:10:23.149 --> 01:10:23.159 align:start position:0%
boxer if you can be kind of a felony
 
01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
okay we wanted to get rid of that no
 
01:10:27.350 --> 01:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
longer can ask this you must know can't
 
01:10:29.390 --> 01:10:29.400 align:start position:0%
take a you know you can't ask someone to
 
01:10:31.970 --> 01:10:31.980 align:start position:0%
take or for a credit check
 
01:10:34.729 --> 01:10:34.739 align:start position:0%
unless a whole list of exclusions except
 
01:10:36.649 --> 01:10:36.659 align:start position:0%
if you touch money or in charge of money
 
01:10:38.330 --> 01:10:38.340 align:start position:0%
work for the nuclear power plant blah
 
01:10:40.370 --> 01:10:40.380 align:start position:0%
blah blah all these other things so
 
01:10:43.310 --> 01:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
we've seen all these things and just
 
01:10:44.810 --> 01:10:44.820 align:start position:0%
just think about this for a second maybe
 
01:10:46.910 --> 01:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
the fact that we have not had all these
 
01:10:49.729 --> 01:10:49.739 align:start position:0%
things if a lot of employers to do
 
01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
things that they feel are important for
 
01:10:53.330 --> 01:10:53.340 align:start position:0%
their businesses which is why we have
 
01:10:55.070 --> 01:10:55.080 align:start position:0%
such a low unemployment rate
 
01:10:57.169 --> 01:10:57.179 align:start position:0%
I'm just just throwing that out there
 
01:10:59.750 --> 01:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
that giving employers the ability to do
 
01:11:01.250 --> 01:11:01.260 align:start position:0%
what they want to do
 
01:11:04.130 --> 01:11:04.140 align:start position:0%
guess what they make decisions if
 
01:11:05.270 --> 01:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
they're going to hire someone with a
 
01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
felony or not and many of them are
 
01:11:08.630 --> 01:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
saying that's okay we're going to give
 
01:11:10.790 --> 01:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
them a chance maybe we're going to take
 
01:11:11.870 --> 01:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
a drug test but we're not going to
 
01:11:13.610 --> 01:11:13.620 align:start position:0%
include marijuana in that drug test
 
01:11:15.470 --> 01:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
anymore because that's okay
 
01:11:17.990 --> 01:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
and that flexibility so I don't want to
 
01:11:20.510 --> 01:11:20.520 align:start position:0%
expand things past
 
01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:23.689 align:start position:0%
expand things past
um

01:11:23.689 --> 01:11:23.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:25.490 --> 01:11:25.500 align:start position:0%
what they are and I'm going to really
 
01:11:27.530 --> 01:11:27.540 align:start position:0%
kind of for myself personally adhere
 
01:11:29.209 --> 01:11:29.219 align:start position:0%
this down to
 
01:11:32.209 --> 01:11:32.219 align:start position:0%
let's follow what the Supreme Court said
 
01:11:35.450 --> 01:11:35.460 align:start position:0%
and try to craft legislation as best we
 
01:11:37.610 --> 01:11:37.620 align:start position:0%
can toward that
 
01:11:37.620 --> 01:11:38.750 align:start position:0%
can toward that
um

01:11:38.750 --> 01:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:40.910 --> 01:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
you want to put another bill in
 
01:11:42.830 --> 01:11:42.840 align:start position:0%
specifically for lack of discrimination
 
01:11:45.169 --> 01:11:45.179 align:start position:0%
I would say try to do that but
 
01:11:47.689 --> 01:11:47.699 align:start position:0%
uh I don't like to to pile on when when
 
01:11:50.030 --> 01:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
we don't have to representative love and
 
01:11:51.110 --> 01:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
then I'm going to wrap this up in the
 
01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
next five minutes for everybody but
 
01:11:54.470 --> 01:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
everyone obviously you know if you
 
01:11:55.669 --> 01:11:55.679 align:start position:0%
really need something to say you really
 
01:11:57.290 --> 01:11:57.300 align:start position:0%
want to say something please feel free
 
01:11:58.490 --> 01:11:58.500 align:start position:0%
to raise your hand representative love
 
01:12:01.189 --> 01:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
okay I want to apologize to anybody I I
 
01:12:03.590 --> 01:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
offended with using the word stoned uh
 
01:12:04.910 --> 01:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
you know I should have used them paid
 
01:12:08.270 --> 01:12:08.280 align:start position:0%
and uh you know I not the not the pile
 
01:12:10.010 --> 01:12:10.020 align:start position:0%
excuses on it I do have a condition
 
01:12:11.630 --> 01:12:11.640 align:start position:0%
where sometimes I have a hard time
 
01:12:13.669 --> 01:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
grabbing a word you know I know what I
 
01:12:15.649 --> 01:12:15.659 align:start position:0%
want to say impaired didn't come to mind
 
01:12:18.290 --> 01:12:18.300 align:start position:0%
you know it I knew it I should have been
 
01:12:20.750 --> 01:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
using something else but David we've
 
01:12:22.189 --> 01:12:22.199 align:start position:0%
been using that word since we were kids
 
01:12:24.470 --> 01:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah that was the word well that
 
01:12:26.209 --> 01:12:26.219 align:start position:0%
was the word back then you know I think
 
01:12:28.070 --> 01:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
I believe there's no one here older than
 
01:12:29.689 --> 01:12:29.699 align:start position:0%
me I don't think but I actually believe
 
01:12:31.669 --> 01:12:31.679 align:start position:0%
stoned oh I'm sorry I've been
 
01:12:33.290 --> 01:12:33.300 align:start position:0%
representative Bouchard you got me I
 
01:12:35.510 --> 01:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
actually believe the word Stone was
 
01:12:37.490 --> 01:12:37.500 align:start position:0%
originally a word for being drunk is
 
01:12:41.290 --> 01:12:41.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:44.390 --> 01:12:44.400 align:start position:0%

01:12:47.450 --> 01:12:47.460 align:start position:0%

um
 
01:13:58.010 --> 01:13:58.020 align:start position:0%
it is important that they're available
 
01:14:01.250 --> 01:14:01.260 align:start position:0%
um when needed an emergency
 
01:14:03.410 --> 01:14:03.420 align:start position:0%
wanting to have some protection if an
 
01:14:05.810 --> 01:14:05.820 align:start position:0%
employee is late to work or unable to

show up to work that they will not be
 
01:14:10.850 --> 01:14:10.860 align:start position:0%
fired because of
 
01:14:13.970 --> 01:14:13.980 align:start position:0%
performing that Duty if they are in a

spoken to the head of the fire chiefs
 
01:14:27.350 --> 01:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
Association about this I know I
 
01:14:30.470 --> 01:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
contacted the lobbyists
 
01:14:32.750 --> 01:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
or the association
 
01:14:36.169 --> 01:14:36.179 align:start position:0%
I know the association had a meeting
 
01:14:36.179 --> 01:14:37.729 align:start position:0%
I know the association had a meeting
um

01:14:37.729 --> 01:14:37.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:39.950 --> 01:14:39.960 align:start position:0%
last week
 
01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:40.750 align:start position:0%
last week
um

01:14:40.750 --> 01:14:40.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:42.290 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:14:42.290 --> 01:14:42.300 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:14:45.189 --> 01:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
um I
 
01:14:48.110 --> 01:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
because specifically of that is there
 
01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:48.890 align:start position:0%
because specifically of that is there
any

01:14:48.890 --> 01:14:48.900 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:14:51.169 --> 01:14:51.179 align:start position:0%
comments that would like to be made to
 
01:14:53.750 --> 01:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
the committee at all
 
01:14:56.090 --> 01:14:56.100 align:start position:0%
Jody please
 
01:15:04.189 --> 01:15:04.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:06.709 --> 01:15:06.719 align:start position:0%
I'll be very brief for the record my
 
01:15:08.510 --> 01:15:08.520 align:start position:0%
name is Jody grimbolis and we represent
 
01:15:09.770 --> 01:15:09.780 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Association of Fire
 
01:15:11.870 --> 01:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
Chiefs we did bring this up to them in
 
01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
the past and did bring it to them
 
01:15:15.229 --> 01:15:15.239 align:start position:0%
recently before their last meeting and
 
01:15:16.490 --> 01:15:16.500 align:start position:0%
it was decided the time that they're
 
01:15:19.189 --> 01:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
going to continue to monitor this this
 
01:15:21.169 --> 01:15:21.179 align:start position:0%
situation they're not taking a position
 
01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
because they do have individual Chiefs
 
01:15:25.550 --> 01:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
with different perspectives
 
01:15:27.290 --> 01:15:27.300 align:start position:0%
so I'll leave it at that
 
01:15:29.090 --> 01:15:29.100 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:15:30.890 --> 01:15:30.900 align:start position:0%
um obviously the the default the
 
01:15:33.229 --> 01:15:33.239 align:start position:0%
full-time Fire Chiefs and the chiefs
 
01:15:34.610 --> 01:15:34.620 align:start position:0%
with the volunteers have a different
 
01:15:37.669 --> 01:15:37.679 align:start position:0%
perspective on on the law or on the
 
01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
proposed law and the circumstance so I'm
 
01:15:42.770 --> 01:15:42.780 align:start position:0%
not going to I'll save my comments for
 
01:15:44.570 --> 01:15:44.580 align:start position:0%
the end I will open it up
 
01:15:47.990 --> 01:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
um to anyone's comments uh Vice chairman
 
01:15:53.330 --> 01:15:53.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:55.910 --> 01:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
I'll get to this earlier rather than
 
01:15:58.370 --> 01:15:58.380 align:start position:0%
later I'm I'm looking at the
 
01:16:01.310 --> 01:16:01.320 align:start position:0%
the the score sheet here
 
01:16:04.550 --> 01:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
um we voted on two amendments in
 
01:16:06.410 --> 01:16:06.420 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
01:16:06.420 --> 01:16:08.169 align:start position:0%
executive session
um

01:16:08.169 --> 01:16:08.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:13.490 --> 01:16:13.500 align:start position:0%
0990 and 0979 both of those amendments
 
01:16:16.370 --> 01:16:16.380 align:start position:0%
came to a 10-10 vote so neither of them
 
01:16:20.450 --> 01:16:20.460 align:start position:0%
passed we also voted on um autopass and
 
01:16:23.450 --> 01:16:23.460 align:start position:0%
that was an 8-12 vote and the retain was
 
01:16:29.930 --> 01:16:29.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:32.930 --> 01:16:32.940 align:start position:0%
I'll continue for a second please do
 
01:16:35.149 --> 01:16:35.159 align:start position:0%
um I
 
01:16:36.770 --> 01:16:36.780 align:start position:0%
I guess it's it's
 
01:16:36.780 --> 01:16:38.750 align:start position:0%
I guess it's it's
um

01:16:38.750 --> 01:16:38.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:40.669 --> 01:16:40.679 align:start position:0%
I guess I feel exactly the way the
 
01:16:43.070 --> 01:16:43.080 align:start position:0%
police or the fire chiefs do
 
01:16:45.470 --> 01:16:45.480 align:start position:0%
I don't I I'm not I'm trying to figure
 
01:16:47.090 --> 01:16:47.100 align:start position:0%
out if this is a bill that we really
 
01:16:49.250 --> 01:16:49.260 align:start position:0%
need or not
 
01:16:51.890 --> 01:16:51.900 align:start position:0%
um and they're not sure
 
01:16:54.229 --> 01:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
and I'm scratching my head because I'm
 
01:16:55.910 --> 01:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
not sure
 
01:16:58.070 --> 01:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
um if there's a need I think we should
 
01:17:00.770 --> 01:17:00.780 align:start position:0%
try to find a way to to address the need
 
01:17:07.870 --> 01:17:07.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:10.020 align:start position:0%
damn oh man
 
01:17:13.070 --> 01:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth
 
01:17:19.310 --> 01:17:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:23.090 --> 01:17:23.100 align:start position:0%
that was the previous chairman yeah wow
 
01:17:26.570 --> 01:17:26.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:29.810 --> 01:17:29.820 align:start position:0%
go ahead so I've probably gotten a
 
01:17:31.790 --> 01:17:31.800 align:start position:0%
little tiresome with my example about
 
01:17:33.610 --> 01:17:33.620 align:start position:0%
the airline pilot
 
01:17:37.370 --> 01:17:37.380 align:start position:0%
in part because it is it is a little out
 
01:17:39.530 --> 01:17:39.540 align:start position:0%
there I don't think it it could ever
 
01:17:43.010 --> 01:17:43.020 align:start position:0%
happen but since that discussion
 
01:17:43.020 --> 01:17:44.090 align:start position:0%
happen but since that discussion
um

01:17:44.090 --> 01:17:44.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:45.890 --> 01:17:45.900 align:start position:0%
one thing that has brought been brought
 
01:17:49.130 --> 01:17:49.140 align:start position:0%
up is about the employee who is a
 
01:17:51.290 --> 01:17:51.300 align:start position:0%
full-time firefighter
 
01:17:54.050 --> 01:17:54.060 align:start position:0%
and that that only
 
01:17:57.410 --> 01:17:57.420 align:start position:0%
can happen I'm sure it does I'm
 
01:18:00.830 --> 01:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
imagining uh I I know from talking with
 
01:18:03.890 --> 01:18:03.900 align:start position:0%
our fire people especially the the
 
01:18:03.900 --> 01:18:05.390 align:start position:0%
our fire people especially the the
younger

01:18:05.390 --> 01:18:05.400 align:start position:0%
younger
 
01:18:08.030 --> 01:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
um firefighters and and probably some of
 
01:18:10.310 --> 01:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
the older ones too really like the
 
01:18:11.930 --> 01:18:11.940 align:start position:0%
larger departments where they can get
 
01:18:15.229 --> 01:18:15.239 align:start position:0%
the three on four off ships that's very
 
01:18:19.430 --> 01:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
desirable for a certain segment so
 
01:18:22.610 --> 01:18:22.620 align:start position:0%
um I am quite sure there are
 
01:18:25.370 --> 01:18:25.380 align:start position:0%
uh firefighters who live in a smaller
 
01:18:28.970 --> 01:18:28.980 align:start position:0%
town but work in a nearby City to get a
 
01:18:32.330 --> 01:18:32.340 align:start position:0%
full-time job and and the better shift
 
01:18:35.030 --> 01:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
and it would be perfectly reasonable for
 
01:18:36.770 --> 01:18:36.780 align:start position:0%
on those four days when you're not
 
01:18:39.410 --> 01:18:39.420 align:start position:0%
working to be on call with your local
 
01:18:41.870 --> 01:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
fire department it's a win for everybody
 
01:18:44.209 --> 01:18:44.219 align:start position:0%
you get an experienced person helping
 
01:18:46.310 --> 01:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
out where they need it it doesn't
 
01:18:49.970 --> 01:18:49.980 align:start position:0%
interfere with the job but and I'll look
 
01:18:51.709 --> 01:18:51.719 align:start position:0%
to some of the members here who have
 
01:18:54.410 --> 01:18:54.420 align:start position:0%
spent a career in firefighting
 
01:18:57.830 --> 01:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that when you're on when
 
01:19:01.430 --> 01:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
you have those three days on shift that
 
01:19:05.350 --> 01:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
your fire chief should have some say
 
01:19:07.910 --> 01:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
in whether you're going to be there on
 
01:19:09.649 --> 01:19:09.659 align:start position:0%
time or whether you're going to leave
 
01:19:11.649 --> 01:19:11.659 align:start position:0%
early or
 
01:19:14.870 --> 01:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
whether there's an expectation that when
 
01:19:17.209 --> 01:19:17.219 align:start position:0%
you're you've been on for 12 hours you
 
01:19:18.830 --> 01:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
don't go and stay up the whole night
 
01:19:20.450 --> 01:19:20.460 align:start position:0%
before you come back for another 12
 
01:19:23.450 --> 01:19:23.460 align:start position:0%
hours and I reading between the lines
 
01:19:25.310 --> 01:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
with the fire chiefs I would imagine
 
01:19:27.890 --> 01:19:27.900 align:start position:0%
that there is a difference of opinion
 
01:19:30.530 --> 01:19:30.540 align:start position:0%
that some people
 
01:19:33.410 --> 01:19:33.420 align:start position:0%
are are willing to accommodate some
 
01:19:35.810 --> 01:19:35.820 align:start position:0%
departments are willing to accommodate
 
01:19:38.570 --> 01:19:38.580 align:start position:0%
more others less some of them probably
 
01:19:41.270 --> 01:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
have very strict that on those three
 
01:19:43.490 --> 01:19:43.500 align:start position:0%
days you're on shift you are here on
 
01:19:45.770 --> 01:19:45.780 align:start position:0%
time and you stay for the whole shift
 
01:19:48.290 --> 01:19:48.300 align:start position:0%
and in this case it's not a matter of
 
01:19:50.630 --> 01:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
well you know they're out there saving a
 
01:19:52.970 --> 01:19:52.980 align:start position:0%
life as a volunteer that's that's what
 
01:19:55.130 --> 01:19:55.140 align:start position:0%
they're doing in their full-time job as
 
01:19:55.140 --> 01:19:56.270 align:start position:0%
they're doing in their full-time job as
well

01:19:56.270 --> 01:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:20:00.550 --> 01:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
uh just on the last bill we talked about
 
01:20:03.490 --> 01:20:03.500 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman you mentioned a number of
 
01:20:08.570 --> 01:20:08.580 align:start position:0%
cases where we've left it to employers
 
01:20:12.830 --> 01:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
to each figure out how to walk that line
 
01:20:15.430 --> 01:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
and and there are different solutions
 
01:20:17.510 --> 01:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
and I think
 
01:20:20.630 --> 01:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
the employment environment is better for
 
01:20:25.330 --> 01:20:25.340 align:start position:0%
that and to me that's this bill tries to
 
01:20:28.610 --> 01:20:28.620 align:start position:0%
come up with one size fits all one way
 
01:20:29.689 --> 01:20:29.699 align:start position:0%
to go
 
01:20:33.830 --> 01:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
and I don't I believe that
 
01:20:36.770 --> 01:20:36.780 align:start position:0%
the fire chiefs despite having a range
 
01:20:39.709 --> 01:20:39.719 align:start position:0%
of opinions each one of those opinions
 
01:20:44.229 --> 01:20:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:47.090 --> 01:20:47.100 align:start position:0%
like my namesake said
 
01:20:50.450 --> 01:20:50.460 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned that we were not there
 
01:20:52.970 --> 01:20:52.980 align:start position:0%
with what the problem is what this
 
01:20:55.070 --> 01:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
solution would do and whether we're
 
01:20:57.830 --> 01:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
we're on the right path with it
 
01:21:01.669 --> 01:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:03.850 --> 01:21:03.860 align:start position:0%
okay gentlemen flip a coin
 
01:21:06.050 --> 01:21:06.060 align:start position:0%
representative Cahill Boucher than I
 
01:21:07.370 --> 01:21:07.380 align:start position:0%
would like to hear from some of the
 
01:21:09.350 --> 01:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
professional firefighters thank you Mr
 
01:21:11.630 --> 01:21:11.640 align:start position:0%
chair and I think the problem that we're
 
01:21:13.130 --> 01:21:13.140 align:start position:0%
trying to address the reason the bill
 
01:21:15.910 --> 01:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
came to us is because there is a problem
 
01:21:18.950 --> 01:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
recruiting and retaining people for the
 
01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:20.390 align:start position:0%
recruiting and retaining people for the
volunteer

01:21:20.390 --> 01:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
volunteer
 
01:21:22.669 --> 01:21:22.679 align:start position:0%
but I'm not sure if this is the solution
 
01:21:24.890 --> 01:21:24.900 align:start position:0%
to it because I what you know I talked
 
01:21:27.169 --> 01:21:27.179 align:start position:0%
to my fire chief and and his biggest
 
01:21:29.390 --> 01:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
challenge is that well
 
01:21:32.090 --> 01:21:32.100 align:start position:0%
uh people that are living in town are
 
01:21:35.149 --> 01:21:35.159 align:start position:0%
working 20 30 40 miles away so they're
 
01:21:37.490 --> 01:21:37.500 align:start position:0%
not really able if they were willing to
 
01:21:41.110 --> 01:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
come back and answer a call in our town
 
01:21:44.330 --> 01:21:44.340 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure I I'm just looking at
 
01:21:46.189 --> 01:21:46.199 align:start position:0%
the municipal Association to try to find
 
01:21:48.770 --> 01:21:48.780 align:start position:0%
out what the towns are doing to
 
01:21:51.470 --> 01:21:51.480 align:start position:0%
incentivize or encourage and I guess
 
01:21:53.149 --> 01:21:53.159 align:start position:0%
it's a mixed bag and we certainly we
 
01:21:54.709 --> 01:21:54.719 align:start position:0%
don't want to mandate
 
01:21:57.050 --> 01:21:57.060 align:start position:0%
anything but as far as help with the
 
01:21:58.970 --> 01:21:58.980 align:start position:0%
training and and again if you're a
 
01:22:00.410 --> 01:22:00.420 align:start position:0%
professional firefighter you you're
 
01:22:02.510 --> 01:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
getting the training that you need to go
 
01:22:04.189 --> 01:22:04.199 align:start position:0%
back and serve the community where you
 
01:22:08.030 --> 01:22:08.040 align:start position:0%
reside which I think is is a win-win but
 
01:22:09.110 --> 01:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
I don't know what there's something
 
01:22:11.330 --> 01:22:11.340 align:start position:0%
about scheduling which you know you're
 
01:22:13.490 --> 01:22:13.500 align:start position:0%
you're uh available to answer the call
 
01:22:15.590 --> 01:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
and if you can't if you can't then you
 
01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:16.370 align:start position:0%
and if you can't if you can't then you
don't

01:22:16.370 --> 01:22:16.380 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:22:18.590 --> 01:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
but you do have that compulsion to go
 
01:22:21.590 --> 01:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
and save that life so it's I'm not sure
 
01:22:23.510 --> 01:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
if this is something we can address in
 
01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:24.430 align:start position:0%
if this is something we can address in
labor

01:22:24.430 --> 01:22:24.440 align:start position:0%
labor
 
01:22:27.950 --> 01:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
but again this gets back to having more
 
01:22:30.649 --> 01:22:30.659 align:start position:0%
young people who can climb these ladders
 
01:22:33.290 --> 01:22:33.300 align:start position:0%
and yet fit it into their work and life
 
01:22:33.300 --> 01:22:34.850 align:start position:0%
and yet fit it into their work and life
schedule

01:22:34.850 --> 01:22:34.860 align:start position:0%
schedule
 
01:22:36.709 --> 01:22:36.719 align:start position:0%
thank you before you you thank you
 
01:22:38.149 --> 01:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
original kale before you speak
 
01:22:39.890 --> 01:22:39.900 align:start position:0%
representative Bouchard representative I
 
01:22:41.870 --> 01:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
know you're itching to talk and hello
 
01:22:45.110 --> 01:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
although this is a uh retained uh
 
01:22:47.030 --> 01:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
session I'm going to let you speak in a
 
01:22:48.590 --> 01:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
couple minutes I'd like everyone to have
 
01:22:50.270 --> 01:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
their conversation if you would like us
 
01:22:51.709 --> 01:22:51.719 align:start position:0%
because I know what it's like sitting
 
01:22:52.790 --> 01:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
there when people are talking about a
 
01:22:54.290 --> 01:22:54.300 align:start position:0%
bill you want so we're going to be a
 
01:22:55.669 --> 01:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
little flexible here but I'm gonna let
 
01:22:57.110 --> 01:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
everyone say their piece for a little
 
01:22:59.390 --> 01:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
bit first so I will recognize you all
 
01:23:01.370 --> 01:23:01.380 align:start position:0%
right representative Bouchard thank you
 
01:23:03.430 --> 01:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and I'll keep it brief
 
01:23:06.290 --> 01:23:06.300 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm looking uh
 
01:23:10.250 --> 01:23:10.260 align:start position:0%
at the um the scenario that if you are a
 
01:23:11.570 --> 01:23:11.580 align:start position:0%
business owner
 
01:23:14.330 --> 01:23:14.340 align:start position:0%
and choose to
 
01:23:17.450 --> 01:23:17.460 align:start position:0%
start your business in a community that
 
01:23:19.550 --> 01:23:19.560 align:start position:0%
does not have a full-time Fire
 
01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:20.570 align:start position:0%
does not have a full-time Fire
Department

01:23:20.570 --> 01:23:20.580 align:start position:0%
Department
 
01:23:23.810 --> 01:23:23.820 align:start position:0%
I think you need to accommodate
 
01:23:25.550 --> 01:23:25.560 align:start position:0%
for your Volunteer Fire Department
 
01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:27.410 align:start position:0%
for your Volunteer Fire Department
volunteer

01:23:27.410 --> 01:23:27.420 align:start position:0%
volunteer
 
01:23:27.420 --> 01:23:29.750 align:start position:0%
volunteer
firefighters

01:23:29.750 --> 01:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
firefighters
 
01:23:32.149 --> 01:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
and that's why I
 
01:23:34.430 --> 01:23:34.440 align:start position:0%
I will support this bill
 
01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:35.810 align:start position:0%
I will support this bill
okay

01:23:35.810 --> 01:23:35.820 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:23:38.330 --> 01:23:38.340 align:start position:0%
representative Drago you wanted I know
 
01:23:39.649 --> 01:23:39.659 align:start position:0%
you wanted to be on this committee I'm
 
01:23:40.550 --> 01:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
going to let you speak if you have
 
01:23:43.130 --> 01:23:43.140 align:start position:0%
something to to say
 
01:23:43.140 --> 01:23:44.570 align:start position:0%
something to to say
sure

01:23:44.570 --> 01:23:44.580 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:23:49.370 --> 01:23:49.380 align:start position:0%
as as the bill is ran now I it's hard to
 
01:23:51.050 --> 01:23:51.060 align:start position:0%
support and I
 
01:23:52.729 --> 01:23:52.739 align:start position:0%
I don't know if it's better to pile on
 
01:23:54.590 --> 01:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
amendments to make the bill better or if
 
01:23:57.590 --> 01:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
it's better to collectively get ideas
 
01:24:00.050 --> 01:24:00.060 align:start position:0%
and then just create a new one but
 
01:24:01.430 --> 01:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
I agree with what representative
 
01:24:03.110 --> 01:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
Bouchard was saying that if you are in a
 
01:24:04.669 --> 01:24:04.679 align:start position:0%
community that doesn't have it then yes
 
01:24:06.290 --> 01:24:06.300 align:start position:0%
it's good to help out
 
01:24:08.330 --> 01:24:08.340 align:start position:0%
I don't think we need to legislate and
 
01:24:10.430 --> 01:24:10.440 align:start position:0%
force businesses to do that
 
01:24:12.770 --> 01:24:12.780 align:start position:0%
um and like what representative seaworth
 
01:24:14.990 --> 01:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
said it's a one-size-fits all and I
 
01:24:16.130 --> 01:24:16.140 align:start position:0%
don't think it's going to fit everybody
 
01:24:18.530 --> 01:24:18.540 align:start position:0%
with the way the bills are in because if
 
01:24:20.930 --> 01:24:20.940 align:start position:0%
I'm in a town that pays for fire service
 
01:24:23.030 --> 01:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
and I'm already paying my taxes but I
 
01:24:24.169 --> 01:24:24.179 align:start position:0%
have an employee that lives in the next
 
01:24:25.610 --> 01:24:25.620 align:start position:0%
town over that doesn't
 
01:24:27.950 --> 01:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
why am I paying taxes and also losing an
 
01:24:30.050 --> 01:24:30.060 align:start position:0%
employee at the same time so that's just
 
01:24:32.630 --> 01:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
an example of how it doesn't it doesn't
 
01:24:35.810 --> 01:24:35.820 align:start position:0%
fit every situation I do agree there's a
 
01:24:37.250 --> 01:24:37.260 align:start position:0%
recruiting issue
 
01:24:37.260 --> 01:24:38.750 align:start position:0%
recruiting issue
um

01:24:38.750 --> 01:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:41.149 --> 01:24:41.159 align:start position:0%
but I don't think forcing businesses
 
01:24:44.689 --> 01:24:44.699 align:start position:0%
uh to lose employees
 
01:24:47.870 --> 01:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
to staff a fire agency is a way to do it
 
01:24:50.810 --> 01:24:50.820 align:start position:0%
or any emergency responder for that
 
01:24:50.820 --> 01:24:51.950 align:start position:0%
or any emergency responder for that
matter

01:24:51.950 --> 01:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
matter
 
01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:54.050 align:start position:0%
matter
um

01:24:54.050 --> 01:24:54.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:55.370 --> 01:24:55.380 align:start position:0%
because there's two ways to do it one
 
01:24:58.130 --> 01:24:58.140 align:start position:0%
you either pay taxes and the town hires
 
01:25:00.530 --> 01:25:00.540 align:start position:0%
employees which we all know is not
 
01:25:02.390 --> 01:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
feasible in some of these small towns
 
01:25:04.189 --> 01:25:04.199 align:start position:0%
but at the same time a small business
 
01:25:05.930 --> 01:25:05.940 align:start position:0%
who has two employees shouldn't have to
 
01:25:09.110 --> 01:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
lose a day's wage of one of their one of
 
01:25:11.330 --> 01:25:11.340 align:start position:0%
their employees who's now not providing
 
01:25:13.490 --> 01:25:13.500 align:start position:0%
for his family but also the business
 
01:25:15.410 --> 01:25:15.420 align:start position:0%
owner may not be making enough money off
 
01:25:17.510 --> 01:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
the day for you know to keep his doors
 
01:25:19.970 --> 01:25:19.980 align:start position:0%
open or whatever the situation is so
 
01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
um I do have ideas on how to fix it but
 
01:25:24.110 --> 01:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't know if that's the oh
 
01:25:26.689 --> 01:25:26.699 align:start position:0%
God all right well a few things so I was
 
01:25:28.189 --> 01:25:28.199 align:start position:0%
hoping representative Pratt was going to
 
01:25:29.510 --> 01:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
be here representative Cahill and I
 
01:25:31.550 --> 01:25:31.560 align:start position:0%
talked to him after the last meeting
 
01:25:34.130 --> 01:25:34.140 align:start position:0%
after last house session and he was a
 
01:25:35.930 --> 01:25:35.940 align:start position:0%
fire chief for 29 years and a few of his
 
01:25:37.490 --> 01:25:37.500 align:start position:0%
ideas were
 
01:25:39.830 --> 01:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
in the bill it could only be that if if
 
01:25:41.630 --> 01:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
you work for a private company you're
 
01:25:44.510 --> 01:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
only allowed to respond to structure
 
01:25:46.850 --> 01:25:46.860 align:start position:0%
fires that will narrow down how often
 
01:25:49.669 --> 01:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
the employee needs to be gone
 
01:25:52.189 --> 01:25:52.199 align:start position:0%
um rather than you know maybe not for
 
01:25:54.290 --> 01:25:54.300 align:start position:0%
the car accident so so forth but just
 
01:25:55.810 --> 01:25:55.820 align:start position:0%
for the big emergencies
 
01:25:58.729 --> 01:25:58.739 align:start position:0%
an idea I had is we need to incentivize
 
01:25:59.930 --> 01:25:59.940 align:start position:0%
businesses if they're going to give up
 
01:26:01.510 --> 01:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
an employee for the day
 
01:26:04.310 --> 01:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
why as a town maybe not Vehicle
 
01:26:06.830 --> 01:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
registrations or some something saying
 
01:26:08.090 --> 01:26:08.100 align:start position:0%
hey you know you're getting half price
 
01:26:09.950 --> 01:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
vehicle registration or
 
01:26:12.110 --> 01:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't be only the business paying
 
01:26:14.510 --> 01:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
or suffering not suffering but they
 
01:26:15.709 --> 01:26:15.719 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be the only one that has a
 
01:26:17.870 --> 01:26:17.880 align:start position:0%
skin in the game to staff a Town's fire
 
01:26:20.450 --> 01:26:20.460 align:start position:0%
agency it should be the you know maybe
 
01:26:22.129 --> 01:26:22.139 align:start position:0%
this is a town saving the money on the
 
01:26:25.250 --> 01:26:25.260 align:start position:0%
payroll but maybe a portion of the I
 
01:26:26.689 --> 01:26:26.699 align:start position:0%
don't know property tax or something to
 
01:26:28.129 --> 01:26:28.139 align:start position:0%
some sort of discount some sort of
 
01:26:29.750 --> 01:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
business tax something
 
01:26:31.729 --> 01:26:31.739 align:start position:0%
that's kicked back
 
01:26:33.470 --> 01:26:33.480 align:start position:0%
um there also needs to be some sort of
 
01:26:35.510 --> 01:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
minimum employee amount
 
01:26:37.850 --> 01:26:37.860 align:start position:0%
an employee that a company that only has
 
01:26:39.410 --> 01:26:39.420 align:start position:0%
two employees is a lot different I think
 
01:26:40.970 --> 01:26:40.980 align:start position:0%
I said this in the hearing it's a lot
 
01:26:42.709 --> 01:26:42.719 align:start position:0%
different than a company that has 100
 
01:26:42.719 --> 01:26:44.390 align:start position:0%
different than a company that has 100
employees

01:26:44.390 --> 01:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:26:46.189 --> 01:26:46.199 align:start position:0%
um you know a Walmart can probably lose
 
01:26:48.530 --> 01:26:48.540 align:start position:0%
the cashier for a few hours whereas if
 
01:26:50.570 --> 01:26:50.580 align:start position:0%
you're an employer that has two
 
01:26:52.010 --> 01:26:52.020 align:start position:0%
employees and you need both of them to
 
01:26:53.689 --> 01:26:53.699 align:start position:0%
lift something heavy well now you're
 
01:26:54.890 --> 01:26:54.900 align:start position:0%
standing around waiting for the guy to
 
01:26:56.629 --> 01:26:56.639 align:start position:0%
show up so
 
01:26:58.970 --> 01:26:58.980 align:start position:0%
um I was thinking a minimum amount of 10
 
01:27:01.250 --> 01:27:01.260 align:start position:0%
employees this is only for 10 or more
 
01:27:01.260 --> 01:27:03.169 align:start position:0%
employees this is only for 10 or more
employees

01:27:03.169 --> 01:27:03.179 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:27:03.179 --> 01:27:03.830 align:start position:0%
employees
um

01:27:03.830 --> 01:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:06.229 --> 01:27:06.239 align:start position:0%
and then maybe do it that
 
01:27:07.970 --> 01:27:07.980 align:start position:0%
a business only required if they have 10
 
01:27:09.649 --> 01:27:09.659 align:start position:0%
employees one of them could be a
 
01:27:11.090 --> 01:27:11.100 align:start position:0%
volunteer firefighter if it's 20
 
01:27:13.970 --> 01:27:13.980 align:start position:0%
employees maybe two volunteers so it's a
 
01:27:15.770 --> 01:27:15.780 align:start position:0%
tiered system so they're not losing a
 
01:27:17.570 --> 01:27:17.580 align:start position:0%
bunch of their Workforce and it's based
 
01:27:18.770 --> 01:27:18.780 align:start position:0%
off how many employees are in the
 
01:27:21.110 --> 01:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
company so
 
01:27:22.669 --> 01:27:22.679 align:start position:0%
um based on that I have a question for
 
01:27:25.250 --> 01:27:25.260 align:start position:0%
you because I was thinking uh a little
 
01:27:25.260 --> 01:27:28.910 align:start position:0%
you because I was thinking uh a little
differently

01:27:28.910 --> 01:27:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:30.649 --> 01:27:30.659 align:start position:0%
um I don't care so much of a building
 
01:27:32.810 --> 01:27:32.820 align:start position:0%
burns down I care about the child who's
 
01:27:35.030 --> 01:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
choking the person who's having a heart
 
01:27:38.030 --> 01:27:38.040 align:start position:0%
attack the people trapped in a car in a
 
01:27:40.430 --> 01:27:40.440 align:start position:0%
car accident that getting to those
 
01:27:41.750 --> 01:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
things quicker
 
01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:44.090 align:start position:0%
things quicker
versus

01:27:44.090 --> 01:27:44.100 align:start position:0%
versus
 
01:27:44.100 --> 01:27:47.330 align:start position:0%
versus
um

01:27:47.330 --> 01:27:47.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:49.189 --> 01:27:49.199 align:start position:0%
you know is everyone it's always that
 
01:27:50.450 --> 01:27:50.460 align:start position:0%
thing where as long as people are out of
 
01:27:52.729 --> 01:27:52.739 align:start position:0%
the building type of thing then well
 
01:27:54.229 --> 01:27:54.239 align:start position:0%
surround the building and don't let it
 
01:27:55.669 --> 01:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
go anywhere you know the building could
 
01:27:58.250 --> 01:27:58.260 align:start position:0%
be rebuilt but so I was I'm surprised
 
01:28:00.350 --> 01:28:00.360 align:start position:0%
you're from a structure fire and there's
 
01:28:02.689 --> 01:28:02.699 align:start position:0%
I'm more concerned with the the
 
01:28:06.290 --> 01:28:06.300 align:start position:0%
emergency medical situation and I'm
 
01:28:08.090 --> 01:28:08.100 align:start position:0%
certainly not a professional at this I
 
01:28:10.070 --> 01:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
own a landscape business but
 
01:28:12.050 --> 01:28:12.060 align:start position:0%
I that would probably be a question for
 
01:28:13.250 --> 01:28:13.260 align:start position:0%
some of the people who have done this
 
01:28:15.290 --> 01:28:15.300 align:start position:0%
before it sounded like the structure
 
01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
fire is where they need more Personnel
 
01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:18.470 align:start position:0%
fire is where they need more Personnel
whereas

01:28:18.470 --> 01:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
whereas
 
01:28:20.810 --> 01:28:20.820 align:start position:0%
going responding to a choking or
 
01:28:21.709 --> 01:28:21.719 align:start position:0%
something like that there's usually
 
01:28:23.689 --> 01:28:23.699 align:start position:0%
somebody that can do that it's more of
 
01:28:26.090 --> 01:28:26.100 align:start position:0%
the uh all hands on deck situations that
 
01:28:29.090 --> 01:28:29.100 align:start position:0%
they need the volunteers to be at so I
 
01:28:30.410 --> 01:28:30.420 align:start position:0%
but I don't know that would be a
 
01:28:32.750 --> 01:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
question for people who actually do this
 
01:28:34.430 --> 01:28:34.440 align:start position:0%
well I would like I'm not I don't want
 
01:28:35.810 --> 01:28:35.820 align:start position:0%
to put either either of you two
 
01:28:37.310 --> 01:28:37.320 align:start position:0%
gentlemen on the spot but you are the
 
01:28:38.689 --> 01:28:38.699 align:start position:0%
professionals you've had plenty of
 
01:28:40.550 --> 01:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
experience so
 
01:28:43.070 --> 01:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
um if you would rather opine I would
 
01:28:47.209 --> 01:28:47.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:49.070 --> 01:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
I would just say and I think Michael
 
01:28:50.570 --> 01:28:50.580 align:start position:0%
agree with me
 
01:28:52.910 --> 01:28:52.920 align:start position:0%
ever been retired seven years in the
 
01:28:54.410 --> 01:28:54.420 align:start position:0%
fire service in the seven years has
 
01:28:56.330 --> 01:28:56.340 align:start position:0%
changed drastically I served 29 years
 
01:28:58.370 --> 01:28:58.380 align:start position:0%
Mark's been you know in Manchester for a
 
01:29:00.110 --> 01:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
long time retired
 
01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:01.250 align:start position:0%
long time retired
okay

01:29:01.250 --> 01:29:01.260 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:29:03.890 --> 01:29:03.900 align:start position:0%
and I think the recruitment process
 
01:29:05.390 --> 01:29:05.400 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot that goes into it
 
01:29:07.490 --> 01:29:07.500 align:start position:0%
recruitment retention
 
01:29:07.500 --> 01:29:09.050 align:start position:0%
recruitment retention
um

01:29:09.050 --> 01:29:09.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:11.390 --> 01:29:11.400 align:start position:0%
in full-time
 
01:29:14.270 --> 01:29:14.280 align:start position:0%
um firefighting so I believe there
 
01:29:16.669 --> 01:29:16.679 align:start position:0%
probably is a problem
 
01:29:18.590 --> 01:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
um getting volunteers matter of fact I
 
01:29:21.189 --> 01:29:21.199 align:start position:0%
had a conversation with my wife's uncle
 
01:29:23.930 --> 01:29:23.940 align:start position:0%
on this very subject because I think
 
01:29:25.550 --> 01:29:25.560 align:start position:0%
that we had a bill when Brodie deshays
 
01:29:27.110 --> 01:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
put in the bill
 
01:29:29.870 --> 01:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
um there was an issue up in the rumney
 
01:29:31.850 --> 01:29:31.860 align:start position:0%
area Wentworth area where they aren't
 
01:29:33.649 --> 01:29:33.659 align:start position:0%
getting people responding the calls so
 
01:29:34.669 --> 01:29:34.679 align:start position:0%
they asked if there was something they
 
01:29:35.750 --> 01:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
could do and I said there'll probably be
 
01:29:37.970 --> 01:29:37.980 align:start position:0%
a bill coming forth
 
01:29:37.980 --> 01:29:39.229 align:start position:0%
a bill coming forth
um

01:29:39.229 --> 01:29:39.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:40.970 --> 01:29:40.980 align:start position:0%
but I think there's a delicate balance
 
01:29:43.250 --> 01:29:43.260 align:start position:0%
here and how we do that you know it's
 
01:29:46.550 --> 01:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
you know people when they're employed
 
01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:47.470 align:start position:0%
you know people when they're employed
um

01:29:47.470 --> 01:29:47.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:50.510 --> 01:29:50.520 align:start position:0%
again there's a fine balance as to you
 
01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:51.410 align:start position:0%
again there's a fine balance as to you
know

01:29:51.410 --> 01:29:51.420 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:29:53.390 --> 01:29:53.400 align:start position:0%
do you hold the employers accountable
 
01:29:55.310 --> 01:29:55.320 align:start position:0%
for not allowing these people to go I
 
01:29:57.290 --> 01:29:57.300 align:start position:0%
don't believe that you know you can
 
01:29:58.610 --> 01:29:58.620 align:start position:0%
really do that I mean they have a
 
01:30:00.649 --> 01:30:00.659 align:start position:0%
business to run and I understand the
 
01:30:03.470 --> 01:30:03.480 align:start position:0%
whole thing how we fix this problem
 
01:30:05.750 --> 01:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
I don't know because it appears that
 
01:30:07.790 --> 01:30:07.800 align:start position:0%
there's less and less people that are
 
01:30:09.830 --> 01:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
interested in the fire service and in a
 
01:30:11.090 --> 01:30:11.100 align:start position:0%
full-time position never mind
 
01:30:13.490 --> 01:30:13.500 align:start position:0%
volunteering I mean I can tell you that
 
01:30:15.229 --> 01:30:15.239 align:start position:0%
when I'm looking at the I have good
 
01:30:17.270 --> 01:30:17.280 align:start position:0%
friends down in Ash still and I look at
 
01:30:19.850 --> 01:30:19.860 align:start position:0%
the roster and from seven years ago
 
01:30:22.070 --> 01:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
there's probably a hundred people that
 
01:30:24.950 --> 01:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
have retired since I've been gone and so
 
01:30:26.450 --> 01:30:26.460 align:start position:0%
there you know it seems like every year
 
01:30:28.189 --> 01:30:28.199 align:start position:0%
they're putting on
 
01:30:28.199 --> 01:30:29.090 align:start position:0%
they're putting on
um

01:30:29.090 --> 01:30:29.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:30.770 --> 01:30:30.780 align:start position:0%
they're putting on new people they just
 
01:30:34.070 --> 01:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
had a um they hired 12 new people
 
01:30:36.290 --> 01:30:36.300 align:start position:0%
but the list that they use
 
01:30:37.850 --> 01:30:37.860 align:start position:0%
it appears they're getting smaller and
 
01:30:39.590 --> 01:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
smaller so there are people that are
 
01:30:41.930 --> 01:30:41.940 align:start position:0%
losing interest in these positions for
 
01:30:44.030 --> 01:30:44.040 align:start position:0%
whatever reason it is so if they're
 
01:30:45.950 --> 01:30:45.960 align:start position:0%
having problems in the full-time
 
01:30:45.960 --> 01:30:48.649 align:start position:0%
having problems in the full-time
positions

01:30:48.649 --> 01:30:48.659 align:start position:0%
positions
 
01:30:50.209 --> 01:30:50.219 align:start position:0%
I understand there's a problem with
 
01:30:53.149 --> 01:30:53.159 align:start position:0%
recruiting people to volunteer you know
 
01:30:55.209 --> 01:30:55.219 align:start position:0%
on call some of those people get paid
 
01:30:58.189 --> 01:30:58.199 align:start position:0%
volunteers are just doing it because it
 
01:31:01.370 --> 01:31:01.380 align:start position:0%
may be a hobby to them so
 
01:31:03.169 --> 01:31:03.179 align:start position:0%
is it a big problem I don't know how big
 
01:31:04.370 --> 01:31:04.380 align:start position:0%
a problem it is I don't know what the
 
01:31:06.110 --> 01:31:06.120 align:start position:0%
answer is but I think we definitely need
 
01:31:07.310 --> 01:31:07.320 align:start position:0%
to have you know there's got to be a
 
01:31:08.629 --> 01:31:08.639 align:start position:0%
delicate balance there somewhere along
 
01:31:14.330 --> 01:31:14.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:16.490 --> 01:31:16.500 align:start position:0%
well I've I've participated over the
 
01:31:19.189 --> 01:31:19.199 align:start position:0%
years in less than five prevention for a
 
01:31:22.430 --> 01:31:22.440 align:start position:0%
while over studies about how they rate
 
01:31:22.440 --> 01:31:24.110 align:start position:0%
while over studies about how they rate
insurance

01:31:24.110 --> 01:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
01:31:26.030 --> 01:31:26.040 align:start position:0%
and part of the way they rate insurance
 
01:31:28.790 --> 01:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
is they figure what is capacity what
 
01:31:30.229 --> 01:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
kind of what can you deliver to the
 
01:31:32.450 --> 01:31:32.460 align:start position:0%
scene how far are the trucks away from
 
01:31:34.970 --> 01:31:34.980 align:start position:0%
the location uh how many firefighters
 
01:31:37.370 --> 01:31:37.380 align:start position:0%
you have and and all that's an
 
01:31:39.830 --> 01:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
assessment that's done and all that is
 
01:31:43.010 --> 01:31:43.020 align:start position:0%
boiled down and becomes a rate
 
01:31:46.970 --> 01:31:46.980 align:start position:0%
um so so there these assessments are
 
01:31:49.910 --> 01:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
taking place and and and I'm sure at Tom
 
01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:51.229 align:start position:0%
taking place and and and I'm sure at Tom
meetings

01:31:51.229 --> 01:31:51.239 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
01:31:53.570 --> 01:31:53.580 align:start position:0%
they're having the same discussion it's
 
01:31:55.850 --> 01:31:55.860 align:start position:0%
all about risk it's all about how much
 
01:31:58.310 --> 01:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
risk you want to take
 
01:32:00.470 --> 01:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
um that you could hire
 
01:32:03.470 --> 01:32:03.480 align:start position:0%
uh EMS people put them on full time
 
01:32:05.330 --> 01:32:05.340 align:start position:0%
you could hire firefighters and put them
 
01:32:08.689 --> 01:32:08.699 align:start position:0%
all on full time but when you don't
 
01:32:10.850 --> 01:32:10.860 align:start position:0%
when you don't make that commitment then
 
01:32:12.229 --> 01:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
you are assuming a certain amount of
 
01:32:12.239 --> 01:32:13.070 align:start position:0%
you are assuming a certain amount of
risk

01:32:13.070 --> 01:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
risk
 
01:32:15.410 --> 01:32:15.420 align:start position:0%
now everybody thinks that risk is
 
01:32:17.510 --> 01:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
assigned to somebody else and so it's
 
01:32:19.610 --> 01:32:19.620 align:start position:0%
your house all right so it's your family
 
01:32:21.410 --> 01:32:21.420 align:start position:0%
that's in in big trouble and then they
 
01:32:22.850 --> 01:32:22.860 align:start position:0%
think you know something we probably
 
01:32:24.830 --> 01:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
should have kicked the tax rate up a
 
01:32:27.050 --> 01:32:27.060 align:start position:0%
little bit brought somebody on full time
 
01:32:30.709 --> 01:32:30.719 align:start position:0%
so in these towns where they're doing
 
01:32:30.719 --> 01:32:32.030 align:start position:0%
so in these towns where they're doing
this

01:32:32.030 --> 01:32:32.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:32:33.610 --> 01:32:33.620 align:start position:0%
um and there are many times
 
01:32:36.410 --> 01:32:36.420 align:start position:0%
you know that are making this decision
 
01:32:38.990 --> 01:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
and to bring a firefighter on today it's
 
01:32:42.229 --> 01:32:42.239 align:start position:0%
not the 75 000. you know that's about
 
01:32:44.689 --> 01:32:44.699 align:start position:0%
what you're north of that uh in
 
01:32:47.330 --> 01:32:47.340 align:start position:0%
Manchester it's even higher uh EMS
 
01:32:49.669 --> 01:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
people are probably in the 50 range so
 
01:32:51.530 --> 01:32:51.540 align:start position:0%
it's expensive to do that
 
01:32:54.530 --> 01:32:54.540 align:start position:0%
so the the the patchwork that we have of
 
01:32:57.290 --> 01:32:57.300 align:start position:0%
trying to fill those holes and minimize
 
01:33:00.350 --> 01:33:00.360 align:start position:0%
some of the risks is this such this
 
01:33:02.470 --> 01:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
volunteer fire department environment
 
01:33:06.470 --> 01:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:09.350 --> 01:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
um it's not ideal and the more
 
01:33:12.770 --> 01:33:12.780 align:start position:0%
complicated the service gets the more uh
 
01:33:14.930 --> 01:33:14.940 align:start position:0%
the more emergency medical stuff that
 
01:33:16.850 --> 01:33:16.860 align:start position:0%
comes on the busy of these communities
 
01:33:19.189 --> 01:33:19.199 align:start position:0%
gets the higher the population rates get
 
01:33:21.470 --> 01:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
the more pressure that puts on the
 
01:33:24.649 --> 01:33:24.659 align:start position:0%
volunteer system and the more we the
 
01:33:27.050 --> 01:33:27.060 align:start position:0%
more of an ass there is for uh for
 
01:33:29.930 --> 01:33:29.940 align:start position:0%
businesses in these various communities
 
01:33:31.910 --> 01:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
so I think um
 
01:33:33.709 --> 01:33:33.719 align:start position:0%
you know I think we could we could do
 
01:33:35.149 --> 01:33:35.159 align:start position:0%
this we could say
 
01:33:37.010 --> 01:33:37.020 align:start position:0%
you know firefighters should should have
 
01:33:38.450 --> 01:33:38.460 align:start position:0%
the right to get out but this is going
 
01:33:40.430 --> 01:33:40.440 align:start position:0%
to come to a head at some point
 
01:33:42.470 --> 01:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
and and firefighters are going to
 
01:33:44.149 --> 01:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
communities are going to you know
 
01:33:45.530 --> 01:33:45.540 align:start position:0%
businesses are going to start pushing
 
01:33:47.629 --> 01:33:47.639 align:start position:0%
back saying look we should not have to
 
01:33:49.430 --> 01:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
assume all this responsibility that it
 
01:33:50.990 --> 01:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
should be somebody spread around the
 
01:33:53.810 --> 01:33:53.820 align:start position:0%
community for this uh otherwise maybe
 
01:33:55.550 --> 01:33:55.560 align:start position:0%
we'll think about going some somewhere
 
01:33:57.709 --> 01:33:57.719 align:start position:0%
else and let me say to my colleague
 
01:34:00.290 --> 01:34:00.300 align:start position:0%
who's uh you know when India who owns a
 
01:34:02.689 --> 01:34:02.699 align:start position:0%
business and runs a business and the
 
01:34:04.250 --> 01:34:04.260 align:start position:0%
idea that half of his crew could
 
01:34:06.290 --> 01:34:06.300 align:start position:0%
potentially leave
 
01:34:08.450 --> 01:34:08.460 align:start position:0%
um and go submit that's a big deal that
 
01:34:10.070 --> 01:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
small a lot of small Employers in this
 
01:34:11.149 --> 01:34:11.159 align:start position:0%
community that will just shut the
 
01:34:14.149 --> 01:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
business down so it's um it's a very
 
01:34:16.010 --> 01:34:16.020 align:start position:0%
tough call right now
 
01:34:18.410 --> 01:34:18.420 align:start position:0%
let's break down the bills to what it
 
01:34:20.450 --> 01:34:20.460 align:start position:0%
says here okay
 
01:34:24.350 --> 01:34:24.360 align:start position:0%
no employer shall discharge or take any
 
01:34:27.050 --> 01:34:27.060 align:start position:0%
other disciplinary action against any
 
01:34:30.050 --> 01:34:30.060 align:start position:0%
employee by reason of failure of such
 
01:34:32.629 --> 01:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
employee to report to work
 
01:34:34.490 --> 01:34:34.500 align:start position:0%
at the commencement of such employees
 
01:34:36.410 --> 01:34:36.420 align:start position:0%
regular working hours
 
01:34:38.209 --> 01:34:38.219 align:start position:0%
where the failure is due to the
 
01:34:40.729 --> 01:34:40.739 align:start position:0%
employees responding to an emergency in
 
01:34:42.530 --> 01:34:42.540 align:start position:0%
his or her capacity as a volunteer
 
01:34:44.750 --> 01:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
member of a fire department or ambulance
 
01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:45.890 align:start position:0%
member of a fire department or ambulance
department

01:34:45.890 --> 01:34:45.900 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:34:48.350 --> 01:34:48.360 align:start position:0%
so what we're saying is the bill is
 
01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:49.370 align:start position:0%
so what we're saying is the bill is
about

01:34:49.370 --> 01:34:49.380 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:34:52.370 --> 01:34:52.380 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action and discharge
 
01:34:52.380 --> 01:34:53.689 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action and discharge
okay

01:34:53.689 --> 01:34:53.699 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:34:53.699 --> 01:34:56.810 align:start position:0%
okay
so

01:34:56.810 --> 01:34:56.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:00.050 --> 01:35:00.060 align:start position:0%
with the point of if people aren't it
 
01:35:02.270 --> 01:35:02.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't say that I have to let them go
 
01:35:03.530 --> 01:35:03.540 align:start position:0%
halfway through the day if there's a
 
01:35:05.930 --> 01:35:05.940 align:start position:0%
fire call okay that's that's up to the
 
01:35:08.090 --> 01:35:08.100 align:start position:0%
employer employee to discuss decide now
 
01:35:09.610 --> 01:35:09.620 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:35:14.149 --> 01:35:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:16.250 --> 01:35:16.260 align:start position:0%
such employee to show up for work at the
 
01:35:17.629 --> 01:35:17.639 align:start position:0%
commencement of their period that's what
 
01:35:19.790 --> 01:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
the bill says so narrow it down to what
 
01:35:22.570 --> 01:35:22.580 align:start position:0%
it it is trying to do
 
01:35:22.580 --> 01:35:24.350 align:start position:0%
it it is trying to do
the

01:35:24.350 --> 01:35:24.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:25.129 align:start position:0%
the
um

01:35:25.129 --> 01:35:25.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:25.139 --> 01:35:26.810 align:start position:0%
um
discussion

01:35:26.810 --> 01:35:26.820 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:35:28.550 --> 01:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
bone of contention
 
01:35:30.709 --> 01:35:30.719 align:start position:0%
between representative attitude and I
 
01:35:34.490 --> 01:35:34.500 align:start position:0%
was the the the concept of discharge or
 
01:35:36.410 --> 01:35:36.420 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action
 
01:35:38.990 --> 01:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
my initial thought was okay you can't
 
01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:40.189 align:start position:0%
my initial thought was okay you can't
discharge

01:35:40.189 --> 01:35:40.199 align:start position:0%
discharge
 
01:35:43.850 --> 01:35:43.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:43.860 --> 01:35:45.350 align:start position:0%
 
but

01:35:45.350 --> 01:35:45.360 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:35:47.629 --> 01:35:47.639 align:start position:0%
where do we have that
 
01:35:47.639 --> 01:35:49.030 align:start position:0%
where do we have that
fire

01:35:49.030 --> 01:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
fire
 
01:35:52.250 --> 01:35:52.260 align:start position:0%
discharge versus disciplinary action
 
01:35:54.290 --> 01:35:54.300 align:start position:0%
does the employer have some ability to
 
01:35:55.610 --> 01:35:55.620 align:start position:0%
have some disciplinary action because
 
01:35:57.649 --> 01:35:57.659 align:start position:0%
you don't want someone milking the thing
 
01:36:00.410 --> 01:36:00.420 align:start position:0%
okay uh yeah every morning I don't feel
 
01:36:01.729 --> 01:36:01.739 align:start position:0%
like going to work so if there's a call
 
01:36:03.649 --> 01:36:03.659 align:start position:0%
I'm going to go and and when does it
 
01:36:04.910 --> 01:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
become abuse so that's all we're trying
 
01:36:06.890 --> 01:36:06.900 align:start position:0%
to do is narrow this so I think we all
 
01:36:08.450 --> 01:36:08.460 align:start position:0%
agree that something probably should be
 
01:36:10.189 --> 01:36:10.199 align:start position:0%
done and no one wants to be the one
 
01:36:13.070 --> 01:36:13.080 align:start position:0%
whose neighbor friend family or whatever
 
01:36:15.229 --> 01:36:15.239 align:start position:0%
um can't get the services they need
 
01:36:16.910 --> 01:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
because they were in a volunteer
 
01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:18.649 align:start position:0%
because they were in a volunteer
firefighters

01:36:18.649 --> 01:36:18.659 align:start position:0%
firefighters
 
01:36:22.610 --> 01:36:22.620 align:start position:0%
no employer shall discharge or take any
 
01:36:25.490 --> 01:36:25.500 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action against
 
01:36:29.510 --> 01:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
I am in favor of not discharging
 
01:36:31.310 --> 01:36:31.320 align:start position:0%
I have a little adjective over any kind
 
01:36:32.870 --> 01:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
of discipline because I do still think
 
01:36:35.030 --> 01:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
the employer needs to do something
 
01:36:36.530 --> 01:36:36.540 align:start position:0%
representative attitude was like yeah
 
01:36:38.030 --> 01:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
well but
 
01:36:41.090 --> 01:36:41.100 align:start position:0%
three or four disciplines can equal a
 
01:36:43.729 --> 01:36:43.739 align:start position:0%
discharge and my point was no you can't
 
01:36:46.010 --> 01:36:46.020 align:start position:0%
discharge period end of story even if
 
01:36:47.510 --> 01:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
you've got 20 disciplines you can't
 
01:36:47.520 --> 01:36:49.310 align:start position:0%
you've got 20 disciplines you can't
discharge

01:36:49.310 --> 01:36:49.320 align:start position:0%
discharge
 
01:36:51.709 --> 01:36:51.719 align:start position:0%
so I would like to work on that aspect
 
01:36:54.110 --> 01:36:54.120 align:start position:0%
of this to try to see if we can come up
 
01:36:56.330 --> 01:36:56.340 align:start position:0%
with something without getting really
 
01:36:58.490 --> 01:36:58.500 align:start position:0%
you know big in telling employers and
 
01:37:01.189 --> 01:37:01.199 align:start position:0%
towns and everyone what to do
 
01:37:04.070 --> 01:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
hit that and just decide between the
 
01:37:05.629 --> 01:37:05.639 align:start position:0%
discharge and the disciplinary and try
 
01:37:06.890 --> 01:37:06.900 align:start position:0%
to figure that out I will give you a
 
01:37:08.110 --> 01:37:08.120 align:start position:0%
second but I saw a representative
 
01:37:12.470 --> 01:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
Granger first Sullivan and andrego as I
 
01:37:13.490 --> 01:37:13.500 align:start position:0%
saw the hands go ahead representative
 
01:37:16.129 --> 01:37:16.139 align:start position:0%
Granger I think this is just a question
 
01:37:17.870 --> 01:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
um wouldn't it be might it be better
 
01:37:19.729 --> 01:37:19.739 align:start position:0%
just to make enabling legislation to
 
01:37:22.070 --> 01:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
allow municipalities to decide how to
 
01:37:24.050 --> 01:37:24.060 align:start position:0%
handle this on their own instead of us
 
01:37:25.790 --> 01:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
saying that we have to make it Statewide
 
01:37:27.890 --> 01:37:27.900 align:start position:0%
level rule that has to apply everybody
 
01:37:29.750 --> 01:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
in coax County as well as National and
 
01:37:31.729 --> 01:37:31.739 align:start position:0%
Manchester like it seems to me as though
 
01:37:34.310 --> 01:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
if if we let the municipality sort of
 
01:37:35.689 --> 01:37:35.699 align:start position:0%
figure it out then they would probably
 
01:37:37.610 --> 01:37:37.620 align:start position:0%
figure out a much better system than
 
01:37:39.709 --> 01:37:39.719 align:start position:0%
whatever we can come up with but this
 
01:37:41.390 --> 01:37:41.400 align:start position:0%
isn't for municipalities this is
 
01:37:44.390 --> 01:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
employer employee relationship
 
01:37:46.729 --> 01:37:46.739 align:start position:0%
so we can't have a municipality told
 
01:37:48.830 --> 01:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
employee employer relationship what it
 
01:37:50.689 --> 01:37:50.699 align:start position:0%
should be
 
01:37:52.970 --> 01:37:52.980 align:start position:0%
represent well that okay but if you want
 
01:37:55.129 --> 01:37:55.139 align:start position:0%
Brian a second
 
01:37:56.090 --> 01:37:56.100 align:start position:0%
um I just want to be able to look at
 
01:37:58.430 --> 01:37:58.440 align:start position:0%
representative sorry
 
01:37:58.440 --> 01:37:59.510 align:start position:0%
representative sorry
um

01:37:59.510 --> 01:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:01.430 --> 01:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
um so that's that's my thought of where
 
01:38:03.110 --> 01:38:03.120 align:start position:0%
you're going do you
 
01:38:04.970 --> 01:38:04.980 align:start position:0%
still agree or disagree go ahead just
 
01:38:07.910 --> 01:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
have this so can towns not make any
 
01:38:10.430 --> 01:38:10.440 align:start position:0%
rules for businesses and
 
01:38:14.030 --> 01:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
boy that would be a stretch okay
 
01:38:16.370 --> 01:38:16.380 align:start position:0%
I think Beyond zoning
 
01:38:20.030 --> 01:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
uh planning board things and and stuff
 
01:38:22.729 --> 01:38:22.739 align:start position:0%
like that I don't think any municipality
 
01:38:24.649 --> 01:38:24.659 align:start position:0%
has any kind of authority to have any
 
01:38:26.270 --> 01:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
kind of rule over employee employee
 
01:38:26.280 --> 01:38:27.590 align:start position:0%
kind of rule over employee employee
relationship

01:38:27.590 --> 01:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
relationship
 
01:38:29.030 --> 01:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan followed by
 
01:38:32.149 --> 01:38:32.159 align:start position:0%
Drago I I absolutely hear what you're
 
01:38:35.649 --> 01:38:35.659 align:start position:0%
saying about uh someone who's uh
 
01:38:37.910 --> 01:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
stretching the limits
 
01:38:40.550 --> 01:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
um and why you might want to take the
 
01:38:41.930 --> 01:38:41.940 align:start position:0%
discipline um
 
01:38:44.990 --> 01:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
piece out of it however if
 
01:38:47.570 --> 01:38:47.580 align:start position:0%
discipline can never lead to discharge
 
01:38:50.450 --> 01:38:50.460 align:start position:0%
what's the point
 
01:38:52.010 --> 01:38:52.020 align:start position:0%
I mean it
 
01:38:54.229 --> 01:38:54.239 align:start position:0%
and then my other concern is if you've
 
01:38:56.689 --> 01:38:56.699 align:start position:0%
got 25
 
01:39:00.430 --> 01:39:00.440 align:start position:0%
if you've got 25 disciplinary letters
 
01:39:03.050 --> 01:39:03.060 align:start position:0%
based on firefighting and then you're
 
01:39:05.689 --> 01:39:05.699 align:start position:0%
late to work one day
 
01:39:08.330 --> 01:39:08.340 align:start position:0%
um can you discharge for being late to
 
01:39:10.729 --> 01:39:10.739 align:start position:0%
work with the record of 25 disciplinary
 
01:39:10.739 --> 01:39:11.930 align:start position:0%
work with the record of 25 disciplinary
letters

01:39:11.930 --> 01:39:11.940 align:start position:0%
letters
 
01:39:17.570 --> 01:39:17.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:18.950 --> 01:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
I will let some other people speak and
 
01:39:20.330 --> 01:39:20.340 align:start position:0%
I'll respond to that I just don't want
 
01:39:22.430 --> 01:39:22.440 align:start position:0%
to give but and I think I have
 
01:39:23.750 --> 01:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
legitimate response to that but go ahead
 
01:39:26.930 --> 01:39:26.940 align:start position:0%
okay and it also say but if uh
 
01:39:29.209 --> 01:39:29.219 align:start position:0%
representative wolf has uh some
 
01:39:31.310 --> 01:39:31.320 align:start position:0%
Enlightenment to offer I'd love to hear
 
01:39:32.810 --> 01:39:32.820 align:start position:0%
it yeah I want to I'm going to let
 
01:39:34.910 --> 01:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
representative speak as the people and
 
01:39:37.310 --> 01:39:37.320 align:start position:0%
then uh in love but uh represent if you
 
01:39:39.229 --> 01:39:39.239 align:start position:0%
want to get ready uh wolf representative
 
01:39:40.189 --> 01:39:40.199 align:start position:0%
wolf if you want to get ready to speak
 
01:39:42.530 --> 01:39:42.540 align:start position:0%
in a few moments feel so I'm just going
 
01:39:44.209 --> 01:39:44.219 align:start position:0%
to grab the people that are have their
 
01:39:45.530 --> 01:39:45.540 align:start position:0%
hands up and then we'll let you say
 
01:39:48.229 --> 01:39:48.239 align:start position:0%
something uh representative well I
 
01:39:49.070 --> 01:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
should have raised my hand before
 
01:39:51.169 --> 01:39:51.179 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan because he was
 
01:39:52.910 --> 01:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
like what happened over there same same
 
01:39:54.770 --> 01:39:54.780 align:start position:0%
concept but I was thinking the same
 
01:39:56.390 --> 01:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
thing well first off I do understand
 
01:39:58.129 --> 01:39:58.139 align:start position:0%
that if it's during the day you can tell
 
01:40:00.229 --> 01:40:00.239 align:start position:0%
the employee no you can't go we're busy
 
01:40:01.970 --> 01:40:01.980 align:start position:0%
I have nothing to do with it I know I
 
01:40:03.530 --> 01:40:03.540 align:start position:0%
know what you're saying okay
 
01:40:05.629 --> 01:40:05.639 align:start position:0%
what if it's at 4am this is my question
 
01:40:07.490 --> 01:40:07.500 align:start position:0%
what if it's at 4am
 
01:40:10.129 --> 01:40:10.139 align:start position:0%
their shift starts at six do they call
 
01:40:12.110 --> 01:40:12.120 align:start position:0%
their boss and say hey can I go so they
 
01:40:14.689 --> 01:40:14.699 align:start position:0%
have to call no okay so what now but if
 
01:40:17.209 --> 01:40:17.219 align:start position:0%
they're late you just can't fire them so
 
01:40:19.550 --> 01:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
we can't fire the bill you can't fire or
 
01:40:21.890 --> 01:40:21.900 align:start position:0%
right discharge or discipline okay so
 
01:40:23.209 --> 01:40:23.219 align:start position:0%
that's where that's where I'm getting to
 
01:40:24.110 --> 01:40:24.120 align:start position:0%
so now
 
01:40:27.830 --> 01:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
my business we have a five-strike policy
 
01:40:29.750 --> 01:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
um basically you know first offense
 
01:40:31.970 --> 01:40:31.980 align:start position:0%
second Offense for being late well after
 
01:40:35.810 --> 01:40:35.820 align:start position:0%
the fifth offense or the 25th offense
 
01:40:38.090 --> 01:40:38.100 align:start position:0%
what's good to have a strike policy if
 
01:40:39.470 --> 01:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
there's no consequence at the end so
 
01:40:41.990 --> 01:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
what if you can't discharge an employee
 
01:40:44.330 --> 01:40:44.340 align:start position:0%
for being late over and over and over
 
01:40:46.370 --> 01:40:46.380 align:start position:0%
again but what's the incentive for them
 
01:40:47.510 --> 01:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
to ever show up on time in the first
 
01:40:51.830 --> 01:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
place so I I don't know our consequence
 
01:40:53.149 --> 01:40:53.159 align:start position:0%
for the strike policy is you're
 
01:40:55.729 --> 01:40:55.739 align:start position:0%
terminated but if you take that away but
 
01:40:58.910 --> 01:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
what else can I do
 
01:40:58.920 --> 01:41:00.169 align:start position:0%
what else can I do
um

01:41:00.169 --> 01:41:00.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:02.209 --> 01:41:02.219 align:start position:0%
the way I will respond to both
 
01:41:04.070 --> 01:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan and you on this
 
01:41:04.080 --> 01:41:06.890 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan and you on this
is

01:41:06.890 --> 01:41:06.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:09.110 --> 01:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
you cannot
 
01:41:11.870 --> 01:41:11.880 align:start position:0%
fire them or discipline them the way the
 
01:41:14.629 --> 01:41:14.639 align:start position:0%
bill says now for not showing up however
 
01:41:17.149 --> 01:41:17.159 align:start position:0%
you must you know provide evidence if
 
01:41:20.030 --> 01:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
that's where you were and
 
01:41:20.040 --> 01:41:20.870 align:start position:0%
that's where you were and
um

01:41:20.870 --> 01:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:23.510 --> 01:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
shall require you are not required to
 
01:41:25.209 --> 01:41:25.219 align:start position:0%
compensate them
 
01:41:27.709 --> 01:41:27.719 align:start position:0%
and you must provide from the chief
 
01:41:29.390 --> 01:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
evidence of that's what you were doing
 
01:41:32.209 --> 01:41:32.219 align:start position:0%
now I do think there are other reasons
 
01:41:35.149 --> 01:41:35.159 align:start position:0%
if someone is late first of all
 
01:41:37.129 --> 01:41:37.139 align:start position:0%
you have to look at the people that are
 
01:41:39.109 --> 01:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
firefighters okay
 
01:41:42.410 --> 01:41:42.420 align:start position:0%
they're a very special ilk of people all
 
01:41:44.990 --> 01:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
right and they do something that most of
 
01:41:46.310 --> 01:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
us wouldn't do
 
01:41:51.050 --> 01:41:51.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:54.770 --> 01:41:54.780 align:start position:0%
I don't see them as overall milkers of
 
01:41:57.770 --> 01:41:57.780 align:start position:0%
any kind of situation I mean I'm going
 
01:42:00.290 --> 01:42:00.300 align:start position:0%
to sit there and not work in my my desk
 
01:42:01.910 --> 01:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
today so I can run into a burning
 
01:42:03.290 --> 01:42:03.300 align:start position:0%
building and get hot and sweaty maybe
 
01:42:05.030 --> 01:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
get burned and killed and to try to save
 
01:42:07.070 --> 01:42:07.080 align:start position:0%
someone's life I mean so first of all I
 
01:42:08.149 --> 01:42:08.159 align:start position:0%
don't see them as much as the milk or
 
01:42:08.159 --> 01:42:09.350 align:start position:0%
don't see them as much as the milk or
secondly

01:42:09.350 --> 01:42:09.360 align:start position:0%
secondly
 
01:42:12.229 --> 01:42:12.239 align:start position:0%
what is the reason for the discipline
 
01:42:15.709 --> 01:42:15.719 align:start position:0%
and not discharge well let's say
 
01:42:15.719 --> 01:42:16.430 align:start position:0%
and not discharge well let's say
um

01:42:16.430 --> 01:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:16.440 --> 01:42:18.950 align:start position:0%
um
someone

01:42:18.950 --> 01:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
someone
 
01:42:21.890 --> 01:42:21.900 align:start position:0%
I don't want to discharge them
 
01:42:21.900 --> 01:42:23.750 align:start position:0%
I don't want to discharge them
but

01:42:23.750 --> 01:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:42:26.209 --> 01:42:26.219 align:start position:0%
I still can discipline someone for other
 
01:42:30.109 --> 01:42:30.119 align:start position:0%
things okay you didn't do your job well
 
01:42:33.070 --> 01:42:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:38.930 --> 01:42:38.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:41.149 --> 01:42:41.159 align:start position:0%
kind of a phrase trying to kind of lost
 
01:42:42.290 --> 01:42:42.300 align:start position:0%
my train of thought here's where I'm
 
01:42:42.300 --> 01:42:43.070 align:start position:0%
my train of thought here's where I'm
going

01:42:43.070 --> 01:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
going
 
01:42:45.350 --> 01:42:45.360 align:start position:0%
you're you're kind of what you're saying
 
01:42:46.490 --> 01:42:46.500 align:start position:0%
and what we were saying representative
 
01:42:48.830 --> 01:42:48.840 align:start position:0%
Sullivan says well if you can't
 
01:42:51.169 --> 01:42:51.179 align:start position:0%
uh discharge them to what good is a
 
01:42:52.669 --> 01:42:52.679 align:start position:0%
discipline or if there's so many
 
01:42:54.350 --> 01:42:54.360 align:start position:0%
disciplines I think there's I don't
 
01:42:57.229 --> 01:42:57.239 align:start position:0%
think you should discipline someone
 
01:43:00.169 --> 01:43:00.179 align:start position:0%
for being late or going to a fire
 
01:43:02.330 --> 01:43:02.340 align:start position:0%
you can discipline them for all other
 
01:43:02.340 --> 01:43:03.709 align:start position:0%
you can discipline them for all other
reasons

01:43:03.709 --> 01:43:03.719 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
01:43:06.530 --> 01:43:06.540 align:start position:0%
and possibly fire them for discipline
 
01:43:09.229 --> 01:43:09.239 align:start position:0%
for other reasons failure to do your job
 
01:43:12.590 --> 01:43:12.600 align:start position:0%
and other things but I'm not sure that
 
01:43:12.600 --> 01:43:14.149 align:start position:0%
and other things but I'm not sure that
that

01:43:14.149 --> 01:43:14.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:43:16.729 --> 01:43:16.739 align:start position:0%
putting the two together that that's my
 
01:43:18.350 --> 01:43:18.360 align:start position:0%
problem you I think you're trying to put
 
01:43:19.370 --> 01:43:19.380 align:start position:0%
them both together and I'm trying to
 
01:43:21.350 --> 01:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
delineate them
 
01:43:24.590 --> 01:43:24.600 align:start position:0%
yeah sure it's one of this conversation
 
01:43:26.689 --> 01:43:26.699 align:start position:0%
you just said you can't you shouldn't be
 
01:43:28.310 --> 01:43:28.320 align:start position:0%
able to discipline someone for being
 
01:43:31.370 --> 01:43:31.380 align:start position:0%
late because they're at a fire
 
01:43:33.709 --> 01:43:33.719 align:start position:0%
that's what the bill says you shouldn't
 
01:43:35.870 --> 01:43:35.880 align:start position:0%
discipline them for being late because
 
01:43:37.910 --> 01:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
they're out of fire
 
01:43:40.129 --> 01:43:40.139 align:start position:0%
um at what point would you discipline
 
01:43:43.970 --> 01:43:43.980 align:start position:0%
someone because of their being late
 
01:43:45.709 --> 01:43:45.719 align:start position:0%
because they're out of fire because what
 
01:43:47.629 --> 01:43:47.639 align:start position:0%
you're saying is take discipline out but
 
01:43:50.330 --> 01:43:50.340 align:start position:0%
I I can't see why you need to take
 
01:43:52.490 --> 01:43:52.500 align:start position:0%
discipline out
 
01:43:54.530 --> 01:43:54.540 align:start position:0%
because you have to have that ability
 
01:43:56.510 --> 01:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry to say that I feel the
 
01:43:59.090 --> 01:43:59.100 align:start position:0%
employer needs to have the ability
 
01:44:02.450 --> 01:44:02.460 align:start position:0%
if they feel it is being abused I don't
 
01:44:04.490 --> 01:44:04.500 align:start position:0%
think those people are the type of
 
01:44:06.530 --> 01:44:06.540 align:start position:0%
people that abuse things but I still
 
01:44:09.109 --> 01:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
think if someone is abusing them there
 
01:44:10.910 --> 01:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
needs to be some mechanism should
 
01:44:13.010 --> 01:44:13.020 align:start position:0%
someone be doing that that's the only
 
01:44:15.890 --> 01:44:15.900 align:start position:0%
reason I I'm wary about putting that in
 
01:44:18.770 --> 01:44:18.780 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't say only in cases of
 
01:44:22.270 --> 01:44:22.280 align:start position:0%
abuse basically if the employer isn't it
 
01:44:25.790 --> 01:44:25.800 align:start position:0%
is annoyed because there there's been
 
01:44:29.209 --> 01:44:29.219 align:start position:0%
five fires in the last two weeks
 
01:44:31.250 --> 01:44:31.260 align:start position:0%
um they could discipline because they're
 
01:44:34.189 --> 01:44:34.199 align:start position:0%
annoyed not because there's abuse
 
01:44:37.129 --> 01:44:37.139 align:start position:0%
so that's redefine after the word
 
01:44:39.950 --> 01:44:39.960 align:start position:0%
discharge or take any disciplinary let's
 
01:44:42.590 --> 01:44:42.600 align:start position:0%
redefine what you want to do there so
 
01:44:44.330 --> 01:44:44.340 align:start position:0%
you and I both get what we want with a
 
01:44:45.410 --> 01:44:45.420 align:start position:0%
couple different sentences
 
01:44:50.750 --> 01:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
representative uh uh Drago person and uh
 
01:44:52.430 --> 01:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
yeah I was basically going to say the
 
01:44:55.070 --> 01:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
same thing again it's I'm not saying
 
01:44:57.050 --> 01:44:57.060 align:start position:0%
anybody I'm not saying they're going to
 
01:44:59.270 --> 01:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
go fight a fire and then run to Duncans
 
01:45:00.950 --> 01:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
and say you know what I just I'm gonna
 
01:45:02.870 --> 01:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
kill another hour I I don't think that's
 
01:45:04.490 --> 01:45:04.500 align:start position:0%
the case I think it's responsible people
 
01:45:05.930 --> 01:45:05.940 align:start position:0%
who are going to get back to the job as
 
01:45:08.629 --> 01:45:08.639 align:start position:0%
quickly as possible what I'm saying is
 
01:45:10.669 --> 01:45:10.679 align:start position:0%
if I have a job that needs to be done by
 
01:45:12.770 --> 01:45:12.780 align:start position:0%
Friday I stand to lose money if it
 
01:45:14.930 --> 01:45:14.940 align:start position:0%
doesn't get done and there happens to be
 
01:45:17.450 --> 01:45:17.460 align:start position:0%
three emergencies that that week in the
 
01:45:17.460 --> 01:45:18.290 align:start position:0%
three emergencies that that week in the
morning

01:45:18.290 --> 01:45:18.300 align:start position:0%
morning
 
01:45:19.850 --> 01:45:19.860 align:start position:0%
well now I'm getting a little frustrated
 
01:45:22.430 --> 01:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
that my employee is going even if he
 
01:45:24.109 --> 01:45:24.119 align:start position:0%
comes in right after the fire or
 
01:45:26.570 --> 01:45:26.580 align:start position:0%
whatever the emergency is I still lost
 
01:45:29.629 --> 01:45:29.639 align:start position:0%
time that morning which is slowing my
 
01:45:30.950 --> 01:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
job down
 
01:45:32.990 --> 01:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
and I should have the ability as an
 
01:45:35.209 --> 01:45:35.219 align:start position:0%
employer to say
 
01:45:38.629 --> 01:45:38.639 align:start position:0%
this situation isn't working
 
01:45:40.970 --> 01:45:40.980 align:start position:0%
maybe they don't get fired right away
 
01:45:43.430 --> 01:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
agreed which is why one of my amendments
 
01:45:43.440 --> 01:45:44.390 align:start position:0%
agreed which is why one of my amendments
was

01:45:44.390 --> 01:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:45:48.050 --> 01:45:48.060 align:start position:0%
if you show up late but if you're if but
 
01:45:51.370 --> 01:45:51.380 align:start position:0%
if you're you're this does not say
 
01:45:54.109 --> 01:45:54.119 align:start position:0%
in which we can add in it does not say
 
01:45:56.450 --> 01:45:56.460 align:start position:0%
that your employer can tell you when you
 
01:45:56.460 --> 01:45:58.250 align:start position:0%
that your employer can tell you when you
cannot

01:45:58.250 --> 01:45:58.260 align:start position:0%
cannot
 
01:45:59.930 --> 01:45:59.940 align:start position:0%
if you have a situation where you have a
 
01:46:01.609 --> 01:46:01.619 align:start position:0%
bunch of perishable stuff it has to be
 
01:46:04.310 --> 01:46:04.320 align:start position:0%
planted that day right okay or you're
 
01:46:05.810 --> 01:46:05.820 align:start position:0%
working for I.T and you're turning the
 
01:46:07.550 --> 01:46:07.560 align:start position:0%
whole company over that day
 
01:46:07.560 --> 01:46:08.930 align:start position:0%
whole company over that day
okay

01:46:08.930 --> 01:46:08.940 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:46:10.430 --> 01:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
you can't
 
01:46:12.410 --> 01:46:12.420 align:start position:0%
be late that day
 
01:46:15.830 --> 01:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
you can't go to the fire that morning
 
01:46:18.169 --> 01:46:18.179 align:start position:0%
because of that it does not say that the
 
01:46:21.169 --> 01:46:21.179 align:start position:0%
employer can't tell you on certain times
 
01:46:22.910 --> 01:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
no you can't do that you're not gonna
 
01:46:24.770 --> 01:46:24.780 align:start position:0%
well then that's tomorrow that was a
 
01:46:26.149 --> 01:46:26.159 align:start position:0%
question I had asked because if it's 4
 
01:46:28.370 --> 01:46:28.380 align:start position:0%
a.m and they get a call
 
01:46:30.830 --> 01:46:30.840 align:start position:0%
is there a call to the boss saying hey
 
01:46:32.810 --> 01:46:32.820 align:start position:0%
what's going on for today's schedule is
 
01:46:34.790 --> 01:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
it okay if I take this or are they just
 
01:46:36.410 --> 01:46:36.420 align:start position:0%
automatically showing up late and that's
 
01:46:38.209 --> 01:46:38.219 align:start position:0%
what needs to be differentiated there
 
01:46:39.590 --> 01:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
there needs to be a give and take
 
01:46:41.270 --> 01:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
amongst the employer and the employee
 
01:46:44.090 --> 01:46:44.100 align:start position:0%
and plus the town because if I'm just
 
01:46:46.370 --> 01:46:46.380 align:start position:0%
finding out at 6 30 in the morning that
 
01:46:47.629 --> 01:46:47.639 align:start position:0%
my employee is not going to be in for
 
01:46:50.030 --> 01:46:50.040 align:start position:0%
the day or not the day for the next two
 
01:46:52.250 --> 01:46:52.260 align:start position:0%
hours without a phone call first to say
 
01:46:54.950 --> 01:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
hey can I take this can I go then that's
 
01:46:56.209 --> 01:46:56.219 align:start position:0%
the problem and then if I don't have
 
01:46:59.390 --> 01:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
disciplinary measures to take after that
 
01:47:01.189 --> 01:47:01.199 align:start position:0%
what you just tied my hands completely
 
01:47:03.350 --> 01:47:03.360 align:start position:0%
again that's why I'm trying to narrow it
 
01:47:06.290 --> 01:47:06.300 align:start position:0%
down between discharge discipline and
 
01:47:08.510 --> 01:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
then what the employer can do by
 
01:47:10.250 --> 01:47:10.260 align:start position:0%
agreeing it or not agreeing to it
 
01:47:11.870 --> 01:47:11.880 align:start position:0%
depending on certain and what it and
 
01:47:14.090 --> 01:47:14.100 align:start position:0%
what if they try it for five months say
 
01:47:15.770 --> 01:47:15.780 align:start position:0%
say I have an employee tomorrow that
 
01:47:17.390 --> 01:47:17.400 align:start position:0%
does this and we try for five months and
 
01:47:19.430 --> 01:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
I say this isn't really this this
 
01:47:21.410 --> 01:47:21.420 align:start position:0%
doesn't work I I didn't know beforehand
 
01:47:23.090 --> 01:47:23.100 align:start position:0%
now I know
 
01:47:24.709 --> 01:47:24.719 align:start position:0%
now what do I do it doesn't say anything
 
01:47:28.250 --> 01:47:28.260 align:start position:0%
in the bill it says you know it's it's
 
01:47:30.410 --> 01:47:30.420 align:start position:0%
silent so again if you want to add a few
 
01:47:32.090 --> 01:47:32.100 align:start position:0%
sentences to something that says however
 
01:47:35.330 --> 01:47:35.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:37.729 --> 01:47:37.739 align:start position:0%
say no to the you can't take the calls
 
01:47:39.109 --> 01:47:39.119 align:start position:0%
anymore yeah
 
01:47:40.850 --> 01:47:40.860 align:start position:0%
and that but I still can't get rid of
 
01:47:42.050 --> 01:47:42.060 align:start position:0%
them so if they
 
01:47:44.570 --> 01:47:44.580 align:start position:0%
I guess my question is if you can't if
 
01:47:45.770 --> 01:47:45.780 align:start position:0%
you can't ever part ways because
 
01:47:49.490 --> 01:47:49.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:51.229 --> 01:47:51.239 align:start position:0%
the employee can just tell them they
 
01:47:53.629 --> 01:47:53.639 align:start position:0%
can't go on certain
 
01:47:55.490 --> 01:47:55.500 align:start position:0%
well again
 
01:47:56.870 --> 01:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
this is what we're getting down the road
 
01:47:58.310 --> 01:47:58.320 align:start position:0%
but I'm going to pull over to wolfen but
 
01:48:01.030 --> 01:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
Granger has a Santa
 
01:48:03.530 --> 01:48:03.540 align:start position:0%
we're we're getting down to the real
 
01:48:03.540 --> 01:48:05.149 align:start position:0%
we're we're getting down to the real
things

01:48:05.149 --> 01:48:05.159 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:48:07.189 --> 01:48:07.199 align:start position:0%
as to what the employer can do if you're
 
01:48:08.209 --> 01:48:08.219 align:start position:0%
going to put something in place
 
01:48:10.310 --> 01:48:10.320 align:start position:0%
mandating an employer can't discipline
 
01:48:12.590 --> 01:48:12.600 align:start position:0%
or discharge you should be able to put
 
01:48:13.970 --> 01:48:13.980 align:start position:0%
other things in there that give the
 
01:48:16.070 --> 01:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
employer the ability to say when they
 
01:48:17.510 --> 01:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
can or when they can
 
01:48:19.010 --> 01:48:19.020 align:start position:0%
so I could just say well we don't work
 
01:48:20.330 --> 01:48:20.340 align:start position:0%
weekends so you can just do it on the
 
01:48:23.270 --> 01:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
weekends possibly well then I would be
 
01:48:24.770 --> 01:48:24.780 align:start position:0%
okay with that that would mean again
 
01:48:27.770 --> 01:48:27.780 align:start position:0%
yeah this is a big thing right we're
 
01:48:30.470 --> 01:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
trying to bring down
 
01:48:32.209 --> 01:48:32.219 align:start position:0%
small because it's hard without having
 
01:48:35.330 --> 01:48:35.340 align:start position:0%
it's hard to do this without saying the
 
01:48:36.950 --> 01:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
ultimate thing is we part ways Because
 
01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:39.050 align:start position:0%
ultimate thing is we part ways Because
unless

01:48:39.050 --> 01:48:39.060 align:start position:0%
unless
 
01:48:42.410 --> 01:48:42.420 align:start position:0%
it just as a business owner it's very
 
01:48:45.890 --> 01:48:45.900 align:start position:0%
hard to understand a situation where
 
01:48:48.350 --> 01:48:48.360 align:start position:0%
I can't say no this just isn't working
 
01:48:50.510 --> 01:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
wait this is you could basically say
 
01:48:52.729 --> 01:48:52.739 align:start position:0%
that for anything but I could go to any
 
01:48:54.109 --> 01:48:54.119 align:start position:0%
one of my employees tomorrow and say you
 
01:48:55.970 --> 01:48:55.980 align:start position:0%
know what I own the business this just
 
01:48:57.890 --> 01:48:57.900 align:start position:0%
isn't working
 
01:48:59.450 --> 01:48:59.460 align:start position:0%
work out far aways but now we're writing
 
01:49:00.890 --> 01:49:00.900 align:start position:0%
a bill that says I can't do that for
 
01:49:02.149 --> 01:49:02.159 align:start position:0%
this specific situation that's very
 
01:49:04.609 --> 01:49:04.619 align:start position:0%
tough and I'm not the one to say I'll
 
01:49:05.870 --> 01:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
just come up with some other reasons to
 
01:49:06.830 --> 01:49:06.840 align:start position:0%
get rid of them I'm going to be honest
 
01:49:08.090 --> 01:49:08.100 align:start position:0%
and say this is the reason I'm not going
 
01:49:09.890 --> 01:49:09.900 align:start position:0%
to say well I just don't like your job
 
01:49:11.750 --> 01:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
performance for the afternoons you're
 
01:49:13.310 --> 01:49:13.320 align:start position:0%
slow or whatever no I'm not going to do
 
01:49:14.570 --> 01:49:14.580 align:start position:0%
that if this is the reason that's what
 
01:49:16.010 --> 01:49:16.020 align:start position:0%
I'm going to say I'm not going to skirt
 
01:49:19.129 --> 01:49:19.139 align:start position:0%
the issue by saying this is the reason I
 
01:49:21.290 --> 01:49:21.300 align:start position:0%
it's just very hard to figure out a way
 
01:49:24.229 --> 01:49:24.239 align:start position:0%
that it makes sense as an employer
 
01:49:26.810 --> 01:49:26.820 align:start position:0%
that I can't I
 
01:49:28.550 --> 01:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
am a better word I'm stuck with the
 
01:49:31.370 --> 01:49:31.380 align:start position:0%
employee but no other positions like
 
01:49:32.930 --> 01:49:32.940 align:start position:0%
that I don't understand why this bill
 
01:49:33.950 --> 01:49:33.960 align:start position:0%
would do the same thing that's why
 
01:49:35.390 --> 01:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
you're paying the big bucks to make
 
01:49:37.310 --> 01:49:37.320 align:start position:0%
these tough decisions Ranger Then
 
01:49:39.229 --> 01:49:39.239 align:start position:0%
followed by representative wolf is it
 
01:49:40.609 --> 01:49:40.619 align:start position:0%
okay Mike if I have representative we'll
 
01:49:41.870 --> 01:49:41.880 align:start position:0%
come up after
 
01:49:43.010 --> 01:49:43.020 align:start position:0%
representative Granger and then
 
01:49:45.350 --> 01:49:45.360 align:start position:0%
representative wool so thinking about
 
01:49:48.169 --> 01:49:48.179 align:start position:0%
everything you just said there's uh one
 
01:49:50.689 --> 01:49:50.699 align:start position:0%
real obvious thing to do as an employer
 
01:49:52.370 --> 01:49:52.380 align:start position:0%
to sort of sidestep this whole issue and
 
01:49:54.109 --> 01:49:54.119 align:start position:0%
never deal with it and that's just never
 
01:49:57.229 --> 01:49:57.239 align:start position:0%
hire a fireman and that seems to be an
 
01:49:59.209 --> 01:49:59.219 align:start position:0%
obvious solution that we don't want to
 
01:50:02.570 --> 01:50:02.580 align:start position:0%
encourage uh it doesn't seem to be so
 
01:50:04.970 --> 01:50:04.980 align:start position:0%
the if the goal of the legislation is to
 
01:50:07.450 --> 01:50:07.460 align:start position:0%
get people to volunteer for fire service
 
01:50:09.590 --> 01:50:09.600 align:start position:0%
and you're putting them in a situation
 
01:50:10.850 --> 01:50:10.860 align:start position:0%
where they can you know they can go
 
01:50:13.250 --> 01:50:13.260 align:start position:0%
through the map and realize well if if
 
01:50:14.930 --> 01:50:14.940 align:start position:0%
any potential employer down the road
 
01:50:16.729 --> 01:50:16.739 align:start position:0%
knows that I'm a fireman and they they
 
01:50:19.910 --> 01:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
can't fire me or whatever and they
 
01:50:22.189 --> 01:50:22.199 align:start position:0%
they're they're gonna be the the
 
01:50:24.410 --> 01:50:24.420 align:start position:0%
potential volunteer firemen is going to
 
01:50:26.930 --> 01:50:26.940 align:start position:0%
be able to figure out well why would I
 
01:50:29.149 --> 01:50:29.159 align:start position:0%
volunteer for this then
 
01:50:31.550 --> 01:50:31.560 align:start position:0%
um I could you know just not have a job
 
01:50:34.129 --> 01:50:34.139 align:start position:0%
entirely and you know
 
01:50:34.139 --> 01:50:35.270 align:start position:0%
entirely and you know
so

01:50:35.270 --> 01:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:50:37.370 --> 01:50:37.380 align:start position:0%
you at the beginning when you first hire
 
01:50:39.590 --> 01:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
someone who's a fireman let's say all
 
01:50:41.629 --> 01:50:41.639 align:start position:0%
right and they go on on several calls
 
01:50:43.790 --> 01:50:43.800 align:start position:0%
and you can discipline them but never
 
01:50:46.550 --> 01:50:46.560 align:start position:0%
you know fire them or never you know
 
01:50:49.070 --> 01:50:49.080 align:start position:0%
actually end the contract then you'll
 
01:50:52.070 --> 01:50:52.080 align:start position:0%
have learned a very valuable lesson and
 
01:50:53.270 --> 01:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
um you'll have learned it in the hard
 
01:50:54.830 --> 01:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
way you'll you'll have learned don't
 
01:50:57.470 --> 01:50:57.480 align:start position:0%
fire a fireman and all the other
 
01:50:59.149 --> 01:50:59.159 align:start position:0%
businesses so there's probably going to
 
01:51:00.470 --> 01:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
be a year or two right at the beginning
 
01:51:03.530 --> 01:51:03.540 align:start position:0%
after if this passes as it is where
 
01:51:06.109 --> 01:51:06.119 align:start position:0%
people are actually joining up to be
 
01:51:07.970 --> 01:51:07.980 align:start position:0%
volunteer firefighters but then you know
 
01:51:10.430 --> 01:51:10.440 align:start position:0%
people will figure out pretty quick that
 
01:51:13.129 --> 01:51:13.139 align:start position:0%
it doesn't actually work out so if if
 
01:51:14.930 --> 01:51:14.940 align:start position:0%
the goal is to increase the number of
 
01:51:16.729 --> 01:51:16.739 align:start position:0%
volunteer firemens there seems to be a
 
01:51:19.490 --> 01:51:19.500 align:start position:0%
much broader variety of ways to do that
 
01:51:21.830 --> 01:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
that don't have perverse incentives in
 
01:51:21.840 --> 01:51:22.609 align:start position:0%
that don't have perverse incentives in
there

01:51:22.609 --> 01:51:22.619 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:51:24.830 --> 01:51:24.840 align:start position:0%
valid point representative wolf you've
 
01:51:26.629 --> 01:51:26.639 align:start position:0%
heard a lot of conversation
 
01:51:28.550 --> 01:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
feel free to step up to the microphone
 
01:51:31.189 --> 01:51:31.199 align:start position:0%
and and uh tell us where we're right
 
01:51:35.870 --> 01:51:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:39.830 --> 01:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman committee members
 
01:51:43.070 --> 01:51:43.080 align:start position:0%
um this bill has certainly taken on a
 
01:51:43.080 --> 01:51:44.030 align:start position:0%
um this bill has certainly taken on a
life

01:51:44.030 --> 01:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
life
 
01:51:46.970 --> 01:51:46.980 align:start position:0%
much bigger than I thought it was when
 
01:51:49.490 --> 01:51:49.500 align:start position:0%
going to be when I proposed
 
01:51:53.270 --> 01:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
the original Bill to OLS
 
01:51:57.410 --> 01:51:57.420 align:start position:0%
I've had two firemen volunteers come to
 
01:51:59.149 --> 01:51:59.159 align:start position:0%
me and say
 
01:52:02.090 --> 01:52:02.100 align:start position:0%
I'm being beaten on by my boss because
 
01:52:04.490 --> 01:52:04.500 align:start position:0%
I've had a couple of incidents
 
01:52:07.129 --> 01:52:07.139 align:start position:0%
not big not many but a couple of
 
01:52:10.250 --> 01:52:10.260 align:start position:0%
incidents where I was late
 
01:52:16.010 --> 01:52:16.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:19.129 --> 01:52:19.139 align:start position:0%
and they were reprimanded for showing up
 
01:52:19.139 --> 01:52:21.950 align:start position:0%
and they were reprimanded for showing up
late

01:52:21.950 --> 01:52:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:24.830 --> 01:52:24.840 align:start position:0%
and they now are in a position
 
01:52:28.129 --> 01:52:28.139 align:start position:0%
where they have to make a decision
 
01:52:31.669 --> 01:52:31.679 align:start position:0%
do I continue on to work or do I
 
01:52:33.649 --> 01:52:33.659 align:start position:0%
attend to that accident that I just
 
01:52:35.990 --> 01:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
drove by
 
01:52:38.709 --> 01:52:38.719 align:start position:0%
I think what we were talking about here
 
01:52:42.770 --> 01:52:42.780 align:start position:0%
is and I don't know very many
 
01:52:44.870 --> 01:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
firefighters that are going to try to
 
01:52:47.330 --> 01:52:47.340 align:start position:0%
make a mathematical decision as to
 
01:52:48.649 --> 01:52:48.659 align:start position:0%
whether I get more money as a
 
01:52:51.229 --> 01:52:51.239 align:start position:0%
firefighter or as a volunteer where I
 
01:52:53.689 --> 01:52:53.699 align:start position:0%
don't get any you know we have some call
 
01:52:56.870 --> 01:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
Firefighters Etc
 
01:52:59.990 --> 01:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
I would like the intent of this bill was
 
01:53:03.410 --> 01:53:03.420 align:start position:0%
that if a firefighter is responding is
 
01:53:07.310 --> 01:53:07.320 align:start position:0%
going to work and ends up responding on
 
01:53:08.930 --> 01:53:08.940 align:start position:0%
the way to work
 
01:53:11.570 --> 01:53:11.580 align:start position:0%
not leaving in the middle of the day or
 
01:53:14.090 --> 01:53:14.100 align:start position:0%
any of that sort of stuff that they
 
01:53:16.790 --> 01:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
cannot be reprimanded or fired for
 
01:53:20.390 --> 01:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
performing their duties as
 
01:53:23.149 --> 01:53:23.159 align:start position:0%
as they're on their way to work that was
 
01:53:25.390 --> 01:53:25.400 align:start position:0%
all the intent of the bill was
 
01:53:28.490 --> 01:53:28.500 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to answer questions I
 
01:53:31.250 --> 01:53:31.260 align:start position:0%
think it's just grown beyond that all
 
01:53:33.890 --> 01:53:33.900 align:start position:0%

EMTs
 
01:54:10.430 --> 01:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
I am 100 willing to give the same thing
 
01:54:12.590 --> 01:54:12.600 align:start position:0%
to Firefighters if on their way to work
 
01:54:14.870 --> 01:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
they come across something in render

01:54:35.270 --> 01:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
I'll read it it's 153 a 17.
 
01:54:36.709 --> 01:54:36.719 align:start position:0%
this came to me because representative
 
01:54:38.750 --> 01:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
wolf said well the the EMTs already have
 
01:54:41.030 --> 01:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
it so I went to look at it
 
01:54:43.370 --> 01:54:43.380 align:start position:0%
so I pulled this up and it it wasn't as
 
01:54:45.169 --> 01:54:45.179 align:start position:0%
much as is
 
01:54:47.510 --> 01:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
it's really not the so I was confused
 
01:54:49.370 --> 01:54:49.380 align:start position:0%
because the bill in hand in front of us
 
01:54:51.290 --> 01:54:51.300 align:start position:0%
isn't really consistent with this but I
 
01:54:52.790 --> 01:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
was always okay with it so let me read
 
01:54:55.010 --> 01:54:55.020 align:start position:0%
it one more time no license emergency
 
01:54:57.290 --> 01:54:57.300 align:start position:0%

01:55:14.330 --> 01:55:14.340 align:start position:0%
they come across a traffic accident and

you are a firefighter an EMT or you are
 
01:55:19.609 --> 01:55:19.619 align:start position:0%
driving to work and you see a house on
 
01:55:21.950 --> 01:55:21.960 align:start position:0%
fire you go in you grab people you pull
 
01:55:23.510 --> 01:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
them out you start putting the hose on
 
01:55:25.669 --> 01:55:25.679 align:start position:0%
and do whatever on the way to work it
 
01:55:27.709 --> 01:55:27.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't say about oh I hear a call the
 
01:55:30.470 --> 01:55:30.480 align:start position:0%

president Cahill you can either address
 
01:55:43.729 --> 01:55:43.739 align:start position:0%
me or or was it a wolf uh Mr chair when
 
01:55:45.709 --> 01:55:45.719 align:start position:0%
did you just spread you just said uh on
 
01:55:49.310 --> 01:55:49.320 align:start position:0%
the way to work for responding
 
01:55:50.750 --> 01:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
is that what you is that what I heard
 
01:55:53.510 --> 01:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
you say responding to a call in route to
 
01:55:55.970 --> 01:55:55.980 align:start position:0%
a place of employment responding
 
01:55:58.250 --> 01:55:58.260 align:start position:0%

make it say any firefighter but

um in good faith attempts to render

the employment
 
01:56:28.010 --> 01:56:28.020 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't really say that you know
 
01:56:29.750 --> 01:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
if they get a call on their on their
 
01:56:31.790 --> 01:56:31.800 align:start position:0%
pager it doesn't say that but it doesn't
 
01:56:34.609 --> 01:56:34.619 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say it's not either no but I
 
01:56:37.910 --> 01:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
think correct I mean but it's a lot
 
01:56:39.649 --> 01:56:39.659 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I like it it's not perfect
 
01:56:41.390 --> 01:56:41.400 align:start position:0%
but it's a lot better than it was yeah I
 
01:56:43.790 --> 01:56:43.800 align:start position:0%
like it but I you know because it could
 
01:56:45.649 --> 01:56:45.659 align:start position:0%
be something to interpretation I think
 
01:56:47.570 --> 01:56:47.580 align:start position:0%
it would be or you can add you if you
 
01:56:49.390 --> 01:56:49.400 align:start position:0%
come across it but you can't like
 
01:56:52.010 --> 01:56:52.020 align:start position:0%
deviate from your route to go to a call
 
01:56:54.050 --> 01:56:54.060 align:start position:0%
I mean well we can we can amend a
 
01:56:57.229 --> 01:56:57.239 align:start position:0%
sentence yeah representative wolf I I
 
01:57:00.350 --> 01:57:00.360 align:start position:0%
think as you and I have spoken
 
01:57:03.350 --> 01:57:03.360 align:start position:0%
that takes care of 95 percent of
 
01:57:06.109 --> 01:57:06.119 align:start position:0%
situation you put the firefighters in
 
01:57:10.430 --> 01:57:10.440 align:start position:0%
with the EMS people fine the situation
 
01:57:16.129 --> 01:57:16.139 align:start position:0%
that you just mentioned representative
 
01:57:18.530 --> 01:57:18.540 align:start position:0%
your pager goes off
 
01:57:20.450 --> 01:57:20.460 align:start position:0%
on your belt as you're going to the
 
01:57:22.910 --> 01:57:22.920 align:start position:0%
front as you're going to work
 
01:57:27.050 --> 01:57:27.060 align:start position:0%
in the buyer or the call is just on the
 
01:57:28.850 --> 01:57:28.860 align:start position:0%
next street over
 
01:57:31.609 --> 01:57:31.619 align:start position:0%
and they should be able to go
 
01:57:34.370 --> 01:57:34.380 align:start position:0%
so language in there
 
01:57:37.430 --> 01:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
responding to
 
01:57:39.410 --> 01:57:39.420 align:start position:0%
on the way to work
 
01:57:41.330 --> 01:57:41.340 align:start position:0%
and that's what I would make it whether
 
01:57:43.790 --> 01:57:43.800 align:start position:0%
they come across it or they're getting a
 
01:57:46.250 --> 01:57:46.260 align:start position:0%
pager to go to it
 
01:57:49.250 --> 01:57:49.260 align:start position:0%
I may make it more narrow but I think uh
 
01:57:52.129 --> 01:57:52.139 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna okay that's all we were
 
01:57:54.950 --> 01:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
looking for so they can't be disciplined
 
01:57:57.530 --> 01:57:57.540 align:start position:0%
they can't be discharged because they're
 
01:58:00.050 --> 01:58:00.060 align:start position:0%
going and so it's not leading from work
 
01:58:02.209 --> 01:58:02.219 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not leaving for work right
 
01:58:03.470 --> 01:58:03.480 align:start position:0%
okay or anything like that
 
01:58:05.629 --> 01:58:05.639 align:start position:0%
representative colcom love either to me
 
01:58:08.930 --> 01:58:08.940 align:start position:0%
or the uh representative thank you and I
 
01:58:10.550 --> 01:58:10.560 align:start position:0%
know I'm splitting hairs here and being
 
01:58:13.609 --> 01:58:13.619 align:start position:0%
very specific on this but what about
 
01:58:15.169 --> 01:58:15.179 align:start position:0%
when they're returning to work from
 
01:58:17.149 --> 01:58:17.159 align:start position:0%
lunch midday
 
01:58:19.250 --> 01:58:19.260 align:start position:0%
no no no
 
01:58:22.609 --> 01:58:22.619 align:start position:0%
they've already signed in I mean let's I
 
01:58:25.070 --> 01:58:25.080 align:start position:0%
mean we can sit here and go through all
 
01:58:26.870 --> 01:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
of the what-ifs
 
01:58:30.530 --> 01:58:30.540 align:start position:0%
but if you get that it shows
 
01:58:33.470 --> 01:58:33.480 align:start position:0%
that the communities
 
01:58:36.350 --> 01:58:36.360 align:start position:0%
believe in their firefighters and want
 
01:58:40.250 --> 01:58:40.260 align:start position:0%
to have them and not be so represent so
 
01:58:42.950 --> 01:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
if the call goes off at four o'clock in
 
01:58:44.450 --> 01:58:44.460 align:start position:0%
the morning
 
01:58:46.010 --> 01:58:46.020 align:start position:0%
okay and they are going to work at six
 
01:58:49.370 --> 01:58:49.380 align:start position:0%
well they got to be there at six okay uh
 
01:58:51.470 --> 01:58:51.480 align:start position:0%
it's a it's it's when they're in you
 
01:58:55.850 --> 01:58:55.860 align:start position:0%
know in route from their residence to
 
01:58:59.089 --> 01:58:59.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:01.250 --> 01:59:01.260 align:start position:0%
well that's the way that's the way the
 
01:59:02.689 --> 01:59:02.699 align:start position:0%
current law is
 
01:59:04.850 --> 01:59:04.860 align:start position:0%
with emergency that they come across it
 
01:59:08.030 --> 01:59:08.040 align:start position:0%
okay now the question is
 
01:59:09.470 --> 01:59:09.480 align:start position:0%
um if it's in the pager that's next
 
01:59:10.729 --> 01:59:10.739 align:start position:0%
street over
 
01:59:12.589 --> 01:59:12.599 align:start position:0%
maybe we have to add a sentence that
 
01:59:16.189 --> 01:59:16.199 align:start position:0%
said either yay or nay okay
 
01:59:18.830 --> 01:59:18.840 align:start position:0%
um but um I think we're all going at
 
01:59:20.810 --> 01:59:20.820 align:start position:0%
least a little better I I have to pull
 
01:59:23.810 --> 01:59:23.820 align:start position:0%
them as I saw them representative love
 
01:59:27.109 --> 01:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
Brian one and Brian too
 
01:59:27.119 --> 01:59:28.790 align:start position:0%
Brian one and Brian too
uh

01:59:28.790 --> 01:59:28.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:59:30.709 --> 01:59:30.719 align:start position:0%
I think I think we're not addressing the
 
01:59:32.930 --> 01:59:32.940 align:start position:0%
the you know representative Drago's um
 
01:59:35.209 --> 01:59:35.219 align:start position:0%
original thing the the financial burden
 
01:59:37.189 --> 01:59:37.199 align:start position:0%
here you know the financial burden on
 
01:59:38.450 --> 01:59:38.460 align:start position:0%
the employer
 
01:59:40.910 --> 01:59:40.920 align:start position:0%
okay and the municipality kind of
 
01:59:42.950 --> 01:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
skating because they just have this
 
01:59:45.649 --> 01:59:45.659 align:start position:0%
you know volunteer thing and um you know
 
01:59:48.169 --> 01:59:48.179 align:start position:0%
it's not as a you know we heard seventy
 
01:59:50.390 --> 01:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
five thousand dollars for for a a
 
01:59:52.490 --> 01:59:52.500 align:start position:0%
full-time firefighter
 
01:59:52.500 --> 01:59:53.209 align:start position:0%
full-time firefighter
um

01:59:53.209 --> 01:59:53.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:55.669 --> 01:59:55.679 align:start position:0%
could we amend it to say that um you
 
01:59:59.089 --> 01:59:59.099 align:start position:0%
know that the the city Town municipality
 
02:00:01.550 --> 02:00:01.560 align:start position:0%

you know I'm gonna you know it's I
 
02:00:27.589 --> 02:00:27.599 align:start position:0%
couldn't support that a representative
 
02:00:28.790 --> 02:00:28.800 align:start position:0%
love I understand where you're coming
 
02:00:28.800 --> 02:00:29.570 align:start position:0%
love I understand where you're coming
from

02:00:29.570 --> 02:00:29.580 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:00:31.609 --> 02:00:31.619 align:start position:0%
you know we have a there's a if you guys
 
02:00:32.990 --> 02:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
have ever noticed anything on your
 
02:00:35.209 --> 02:00:35.219 align:start position:0%
homeowner's insurance policy there's a
 
02:00:37.550 --> 02:00:37.560 align:start position:0%
little liability there so if you come
 
02:00:39.169 --> 02:00:39.179 align:start position:0%
into a car accident
 
02:00:41.330 --> 02:00:41.340 align:start position:0%
and you're in in a car accident happens
 
02:00:42.709 --> 02:00:42.719 align:start position:0%
and and
 
02:00:42.719 --> 02:00:43.609 align:start position:0%
and and
um

02:00:43.609 --> 02:00:43.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:45.589 --> 02:00:45.599 align:start position:0%
while you're
 
02:00:47.870 --> 02:00:47.880 align:start position:0%
um uh trying to pull this person out of
 
02:00:49.970 --> 02:00:49.980 align:start position:0%
a burning car which happened on 93 this
 
02:00:52.609 --> 02:00:52.619 align:start position:0%
week uh you break their arm or while you
 
02:00:55.370 --> 02:00:55.380 align:start position:0%
give CPR to them you crack a couple ribs
 
02:00:57.109 --> 02:00:57.119 align:start position:0%
there's a little thing in your liability
 
02:00:58.609 --> 02:00:58.619 align:start position:0%
in your insurance policy for giving
 
02:00:59.990 --> 02:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
Medical Aid
 
02:01:04.070 --> 02:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
okay and just for the for those reasons
 
02:01:04.080 --> 02:01:04.850 align:start position:0%
okay and just for the for those reasons
um

02:01:04.850 --> 02:01:04.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:06.709 --> 02:01:06.719 align:start position:0%
I still believe in this whole thing of
 
02:01:08.330 --> 02:01:08.340 align:start position:0%
helping my fellow man and I would think
 
02:01:09.830 --> 02:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
someone would want to stop on a way if
 
02:01:11.810 --> 02:01:11.820 align:start position:0%
they see a house on fire or a car
 
02:01:14.510 --> 02:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
accident and give and give Aid and and
 
02:01:17.450 --> 02:01:17.460 align:start position:0%
uh I'll forego the the loss of the
 
02:01:20.030 --> 02:01:20.040 align:start position:0%
employer on that one because I think
 
02:01:23.330 --> 02:01:23.340 align:start position:0%
I'm more in favor of letting people help
 
02:01:25.310 --> 02:01:25.320 align:start position:0%
their fellow man for the the because
 
02:01:26.930 --> 02:01:26.940 align:start position:0%
it's the right thing to do
 
02:01:28.970 --> 02:01:28.980 align:start position:0%
so but I I hear what you're saying well
 
02:01:31.910 --> 02:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
I I was just saying you know if
 
02:01:33.830 --> 02:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
representative Drago has a dozen guys
 
02:01:36.290 --> 02:01:36.300 align:start position:0%
working for him and if two of them uh
 
02:01:37.910 --> 02:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
two or three times a month
 
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
or going to calls
 
02:01:41.990 --> 02:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
um we're not going to calls
 
02:01:43.970 --> 02:01:43.980 align:start position:0%
representative love this is on the way
 
02:01:46.129 --> 02:01:46.139 align:start position:0%
to work
 
02:01:48.589 --> 02:01:48.599 align:start position:0%
coming across or seeing so isn't that
 
02:01:50.810 --> 02:01:50.820 align:start position:0%
what the original bill was about no no
 
02:01:54.649 --> 02:01:54.659 align:start position:0%
it's it's no as representative wolf said
 
02:01:56.570 --> 02:01:56.580 align:start position:0%
it kind of got blown up as to leaving
 
02:01:58.850 --> 02:01:58.860 align:start position:0%
work okay doing all these other things
 
02:02:00.830 --> 02:02:00.840 align:start position:0%
into others so uh representative
 
02:02:03.729 --> 02:02:03.739 align:start position:0%
Sullivan uh damn it
 
02:02:07.330 --> 02:02:07.340 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth and Sullivan
 
02:02:10.970 --> 02:02:10.980 align:start position:0%
yeah it might help might help
 
02:02:13.010 --> 02:02:13.020 align:start position:0%
um so I wanted to say I have to agree
 
02:02:15.490 --> 02:02:15.500 align:start position:0%
with representative Holcomb's
 
02:02:19.129 --> 02:02:19.139 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the existing law when
 
02:02:21.410 --> 02:02:21.420 align:start position:0%
I see
 
02:02:24.350 --> 02:02:24.360 align:start position:0%
um the phrase while on route to a place
 
02:02:26.330 --> 02:02:26.340 align:start position:0%
of employment
 
02:02:28.729 --> 02:02:28.739 align:start position:0%
I don't see anything about where you've
 
02:02:33.290 --> 02:02:33.300 align:start position:0%
started on that route why or when a
 
02:02:36.050 --> 02:02:36.060 align:start position:0%
couple of jobs ago I routinely had to
 
02:02:38.990 --> 02:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
move between places of employment during
 
02:02:40.010 --> 02:02:40.020 align:start position:0%
the day
 
02:02:42.950 --> 02:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
and I would think that if I were
 
02:02:42.960 --> 02:02:44.390 align:start position:0%
and I would think that if I were
traveling

02:02:44.390 --> 02:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
traveling
 
02:02:46.629 --> 02:02:46.639 align:start position:0%
an hour up north
 
02:02:50.450 --> 02:02:50.460 align:start position:0%
to get to my second place I needed to be
 
02:02:52.189 --> 02:02:52.199 align:start position:0%
that day
 
02:02:54.890 --> 02:02:54.900 align:start position:0%
um that I would be on route to that
 
02:02:56.930 --> 02:02:56.940 align:start position:0%
place of employment and I kind of hope
 
02:03:00.350 --> 02:03:00.360 align:start position:0%
that if I saw somebody on the side of
 
02:03:01.850 --> 02:03:01.860 align:start position:0%
the road that needed emergency medical
 
02:03:04.669 --> 02:03:04.679 align:start position:0%
attention and I was an EMT I could
 
02:03:06.950 --> 02:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
pull over and help them and be protected
 
02:03:11.030 --> 02:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
by this law so I I don't think
 
02:03:13.370 --> 02:03:13.380 align:start position:0%
and I I
 
02:03:15.770 --> 02:03:15.780 align:start position:0%
this is not an argument against
 
02:03:18.530 --> 02:03:18.540 align:start position:0%
expanding this law I think
 
02:03:21.530 --> 02:03:21.540 align:start position:0%
I I actually like that idea
 
02:03:24.649 --> 02:03:24.659 align:start position:0%
um but I don't read this as being as
 
02:03:27.109 --> 02:03:27.119 align:start position:0%
narrow as it was suggested that it's
 
02:03:31.609 --> 02:03:31.619 align:start position:0%
only before you've made it to your first
 
02:03:34.250 --> 02:03:34.260 align:start position:0%
time card punch of the day
 
02:03:35.629 --> 02:03:35.639 align:start position:0%
um to me
 
02:03:38.810 --> 02:03:38.820 align:start position:0%
this could be any traveling between jobs
 
02:03:38.820 --> 02:03:40.129 align:start position:0%
this could be any traveling between jobs
for

02:03:40.129 --> 02:03:40.139 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:03:41.930 --> 02:03:41.940 align:start position:0%
well I'm glad you and representative
 
02:03:43.729 --> 02:03:43.739 align:start position:0%
colcum brought that up so with the power
 
02:03:45.470 --> 02:03:45.480 align:start position:0%
invested in me as chairman of this
 
02:03:48.169 --> 02:03:48.179 align:start position:0%
committee I will have um you and
 
02:03:49.729 --> 02:03:49.739 align:start position:0%
representative caulkham come up with an
 
02:03:53.330 --> 02:03:53.340 align:start position:0%
amendment to 153 a17 outlining that for
 
02:03:54.830 --> 02:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
firefighters and present it to the
 
02:03:56.149 --> 02:03:56.159 align:start position:0%
committee before our next meeting
 
02:03:56.159 --> 02:03:58.310 align:start position:0%
committee before our next meeting
Representatives

02:03:58.310 --> 02:03:58.320 align:start position:0%
Representatives
 
02:04:01.669 --> 02:04:01.679 align:start position:0%
I happen to believe a simple is good
 
02:04:04.010 --> 02:04:04.020 align:start position:0%
um I like the direction it's going the
 
02:04:04.020 --> 02:04:05.089 align:start position:0%
um I like the direction it's going the
one

02:04:05.089 --> 02:04:05.099 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:04:07.430 --> 02:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
one piece of confusion I've got is where
 
02:04:09.890 --> 02:04:09.900 align:start position:0%
it says under this chapter and I'm
 
02:04:11.990 --> 02:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
concerned that firefighters might not
 
02:04:14.510 --> 02:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
fit under that chapter
 
02:04:16.010 --> 02:04:16.020 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:04:18.290 --> 02:04:18.300 align:start position:0%
um I support the idea of doing an
 
02:04:21.109 --> 02:04:21.119 align:start position:0%
amendment check into that aspect of it
 
02:04:21.119 --> 02:04:23.689 align:start position:0%
amendment check into that aspect of it
it

02:04:23.689 --> 02:04:23.699 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:04:26.209 --> 02:04:26.219 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how you solve it OLS can
 
02:04:27.350 --> 02:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
solve anything
 
02:04:30.950 --> 02:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
so um just so you know what very valid
 
02:04:32.890 --> 02:04:32.900 align:start position:0%
point representative Sullivan
 
02:04:36.470 --> 02:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
153 a emergency medical and Trauma
 
02:04:39.169 --> 02:04:39.179 align:start position:0%
Services is the chapter under Public
 
02:04:42.350 --> 02:04:42.360 align:start position:0%
Safety and Welfare so you are correct we
 
02:04:45.550 --> 02:04:45.560 align:start position:0%
may very well be able to take
 
02:04:48.229 --> 02:04:48.239 align:start position:0%
153 a17
 
02:04:50.930 --> 02:04:50.940 align:start position:0%
2 and place it
 
02:04:54.050 --> 02:04:54.060 align:start position:0%
an identical section maybe under
 
02:04:56.930 --> 02:04:56.940 align:start position:0%
something I don't know is there a place
 
02:05:00.890 --> 02:05:00.900 align:start position:0%
that where it belongs is there RSA for
 
02:05:05.030 --> 02:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh you know any it's probably this one
 
02:05:08.149 --> 02:05:08.159 align:start position:0%
it's not because this is 275 okay which
 
02:05:09.830 --> 02:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
is the the work which is basically the
 
02:05:11.629 --> 02:05:11.639 align:start position:0%
labor law
 
02:05:11.639 --> 02:05:12.890 align:start position:0%
labor law
so

02:05:12.890 --> 02:05:12.900 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:05:15.770 --> 02:05:15.780 align:start position:0%
um OLS maybe may be able to find the
 
02:05:17.570 --> 02:05:17.580 align:start position:0%
right spot a little bit of a more
 
02:05:18.950 --> 02:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
meeting in the minds of what we want to
 
02:05:21.169 --> 02:05:21.179 align:start position:0%
do here with this
 
02:05:24.290 --> 02:05:24.300 align:start position:0%
represent a wolf any last comment uh I
 
02:05:25.669 --> 02:05:25.679 align:start position:0%
was just going to say real quick and
 
02:05:30.050 --> 02:05:30.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:32.930 --> 02:05:32.940 align:start position:0%
I believe that
 
02:05:34.729 --> 02:05:34.739 align:start position:0%
people that are certified as a first
 
02:05:38.510 --> 02:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
responder EMT firefighter
 
02:05:38.520 --> 02:05:39.470 align:start position:0%
responder EMT firefighter
um

02:05:39.470 --> 02:05:39.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:41.330 --> 02:05:41.340 align:start position:0%
because I I'm pretty sure that this was
 
02:05:42.770 --> 02:05:42.780 align:start position:0%
drilled into me when I was in the fire
 
02:05:44.570 --> 02:05:44.580 align:start position:0%
service that if you're coming across
 
02:05:44.580 --> 02:05:45.470 align:start position:0%
service that if you're coming across
something

02:05:45.470 --> 02:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
something
 
02:05:48.350 --> 02:05:48.360 align:start position:0%
regardless of when it is
 
02:05:49.850 --> 02:05:49.860 align:start position:0%
um and I think people are covered under
 
02:05:52.070 --> 02:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
Good Samaritan law that aren't but I
 
02:05:53.770 --> 02:05:53.780 align:start position:0%
think you have an obligation
 
02:05:56.629 --> 02:05:56.639 align:start position:0%
to stop and assist if you come by an
 
02:05:58.129 --> 02:05:58.139 align:start position:0%
accident I mean if somebody saw my truck
 
02:05:59.870 --> 02:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
driving away with a union sticker on the
 
02:06:01.550 --> 02:06:01.560 align:start position:0%
back I'm sure people are not going to be
 
02:06:03.350 --> 02:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
happy if I just go I'm not stopping for
 
02:06:04.790 --> 02:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
this accident and it happened to me one
 
02:06:05.990 --> 02:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
morning when I was actually going to
 
02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:06.890 align:start position:0%
morning when I was actually going to
work

02:06:06.890 --> 02:06:06.900 align:start position:0%
work
 
02:06:09.530 --> 02:06:09.540 align:start position:0%
in Nashua heading down the road to go to
 
02:06:10.729 --> 02:06:10.739 align:start position:0%
work and all of a sudden I see smoke
 
02:06:12.109 --> 02:06:12.119 align:start position:0%
coming from a building
 
02:06:14.689 --> 02:06:14.699 align:start position:0%
stop my truck now it's 7 30 I have to re
 
02:06:16.129 --> 02:06:16.139 align:start position:0%
I have to respond to work at eight
 
02:06:18.830 --> 02:06:18.840 align:start position:0%
o'clock now I'm the first one there day
 
02:06:20.149 --> 02:06:20.159 align:start position:0%
before the fire trucks ran inside the
 
02:06:21.229 --> 02:06:21.239 align:start position:0%
building got the people out of the
 
02:06:23.209 --> 02:06:23.219 align:start position:0%
building wasn't late for work thankfully
 
02:06:25.490 --> 02:06:25.500 align:start position:0%
but I think there is something and maybe
 
02:06:26.930 --> 02:06:26.940 align:start position:0%
I'm mistaken but if we could find that
 
02:06:28.609 --> 02:06:28.619 align:start position:0%
out there may be an obligation for
 
02:06:30.709 --> 02:06:30.719 align:start position:0%
people to have to
 
02:06:32.330 --> 02:06:32.340 align:start position:0%
um stop
 
02:06:35.270 --> 02:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
and render assistance
 
02:06:37.010 --> 02:06:37.020 align:start position:0%
this is the only thing that was brought
 
02:06:39.109 --> 02:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
to my attention I guess I can have OLS
 
02:06:40.790 --> 02:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
do some research or our researcher try
 
02:06:42.709 --> 02:06:42.719 align:start position:0%
to figure out if there is one similar
 
02:06:46.669 --> 02:06:46.679 align:start position:0%
but your point being let's say
 
02:06:49.729 --> 02:06:49.739 align:start position:0%
um you lived in Amherst in your
 
02:06:51.950 --> 02:06:51.960 align:start position:0%
Brookline and you're on the way to
 
02:06:54.830 --> 02:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
you're living it in this case you were
 
02:06:56.450 --> 02:06:56.460 align:start position:0%
in living in Nashville you were going to
 
02:06:58.070 --> 02:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
your job in Nashville let's say you were
 
02:07:00.410 --> 02:07:00.420 align:start position:0%
crossing two towns and you stopped in an
 
02:07:02.689 --> 02:07:02.699 align:start position:0%
adjoined town where you didn't work
 
02:07:04.550 --> 02:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
and then and then you got to work an
 
02:07:05.629 --> 02:07:05.639 align:start position:0%
hour late
 
02:07:08.149 --> 02:07:08.159 align:start position:0%
I don't want you to be disciplined we're
 
02:07:10.430 --> 02:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
not doing for for doing that
 
02:07:11.990 --> 02:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
obviously when the other guys show up
 
02:07:14.030 --> 02:07:14.040 align:start position:0%
you can then go on your way or whatever
 
02:07:16.370 --> 02:07:16.380 align:start position:0%
that's much more consistent with this
 
02:07:20.089 --> 02:07:20.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:22.850 --> 02:07:22.860 align:start position:0%
final hands representative wolf
 
02:07:25.010 --> 02:07:25.020 align:start position:0%
I guess uh
 
02:07:29.030 --> 02:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman sir I think if we can
 
02:07:31.669 --> 02:07:31.679 align:start position:0%
narrow it down to something simple like
 
02:07:34.370 --> 02:07:34.380 align:start position:0%
that we don't have
 
02:07:37.129 --> 02:07:37.139 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge firemen that are out
 
02:07:39.830 --> 02:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
milking the system the communities are
 
02:07:42.770 --> 02:07:42.780 align:start position:0%
not trying to save a few bucks by having
 
02:07:45.589 --> 02:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
volunteers do it versus
 
02:07:48.229 --> 02:07:48.239 align:start position:0%
uh full-time firemen
 
02:07:51.589 --> 02:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
we're trying to improve the recruitment
 
02:07:54.709 --> 02:07:54.719 align:start position:0%
of these volunteers and someday we'll
 
02:07:57.350 --> 02:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
all have full-time fire departments
 
02:08:00.169 --> 02:08:00.179 align:start position:0%
but in the meantime we need to get these
 
02:08:03.050 --> 02:08:03.060 align:start position:0%
people we need to have them want to come
 
02:08:04.250 --> 02:08:04.260 align:start position:0%
to work
 
02:08:07.490 --> 02:08:07.500 align:start position:0%
and not be fearful of being reprimanded
 
02:08:09.890 --> 02:08:09.900 align:start position:0%
or losing their job and I think your
 
02:08:12.589 --> 02:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
solution is I agree my uh favorite uncle
 
02:08:15.830 --> 02:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
was a fire volunteer firefighter for 20
 
02:08:17.270 --> 02:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
some years he worked at Hamilton
 
02:08:19.729 --> 02:08:19.739 align:start position:0%
standard by Bradley Airfield over in
 
02:08:22.490 --> 02:08:22.500 align:start position:0%
Hartford and he responded to the tornado
 
02:08:24.229 --> 02:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
they had there and the fire in the hotel
 
02:08:27.050 --> 02:08:27.060 align:start position:0%
and all the other stuff so I I have a an
 
02:08:29.629 --> 02:08:29.639 align:start position:0%
allegiance to my to my favorite uncle
 
02:08:32.030 --> 02:08:32.040 align:start position:0%
and his volunteer and the stuff that he
 
02:08:33.350 --> 02:08:33.360 align:start position:0%
did over the years I probably could
 
02:08:35.209 --> 02:08:35.219 align:start position:0%
never do so I agree with you thank you
 
02:08:35.219 --> 02:08:37.070 align:start position:0%
never do so I agree with you thank you
representative

02:08:37.070 --> 02:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:08:39.770 --> 02:08:39.780 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan just procedural
 
02:08:41.990 --> 02:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
if there is an amendment that's put
 
02:08:43.729 --> 02:08:43.739 align:start position:0%
together if it could be circulated
 
02:08:46.609 --> 02:08:46.619 align:start position:0%
before we have an executive session that
 
02:08:49.609 --> 02:08:49.619 align:start position:0%
way if there's if all of us nitpicky
 
02:08:53.330 --> 02:08:53.340 align:start position:0%
people find something that uh uh is uh
 
02:08:54.890 --> 02:08:54.900 align:start position:0%
is a problem we won't have to deal with
 
02:08:56.990 --> 02:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
it uh on the day of the executive
 
02:08:59.270 --> 02:08:59.280 align:start position:0%
session uh very valid point I will make
 
02:09:00.950 --> 02:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
sure that it's not even the day before
 
02:09:02.689 --> 02:09:02.699 align:start position:0%
or two days before that everyone should
 
02:09:04.010 --> 02:09:04.020 align:start position:0%
have it for at least a week so that's
 
02:09:06.890 --> 02:09:06.900 align:start position:0%
why representative kulkum and seaworth
 
02:09:08.390 --> 02:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
and I will make sure you get that to you
 
02:09:11.649 --> 02:09:11.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:13.729 --> 02:09:13.739 align:start position:0%
if you indulge me a little
 
02:09:15.830 --> 02:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
light-heartedness can I put and they
 
02:09:17.450 --> 02:09:17.460 align:start position:0%
cannot refuse to hire them in this
 
02:09:20.030 --> 02:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
amendment too
 
02:09:20.040 --> 02:09:23.149 align:start position:0%
amendment too
no

02:09:23.149 --> 02:09:23.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:25.609 --> 02:09:25.619 align:start position:0%
all right very well folks go have lunch
 
02:09:27.169 --> 02:09:27.179 align:start position:0%
one o'clock is
 
02:09:29.750 --> 02:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
um OSHA
 
02:09:32.930 --> 02:09:32.940 align:start position:0%
any other comments anyone need anything
 
02:09:35.870 --> 02:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
thank you appreciate everyone's
 
02:09:35.880 --> 03:08:57.230 align:start position:0%
thank you appreciate everyone's
today

03:08:57.230 --> 03:08:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:00.110 --> 03:09:00.120 align:start position:0%
in the calendar which is sort of like if
 
03:09:01.910 --> 03:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
you see a better price than they charge
 
03:09:04.130 --> 03:09:04.140 align:start position:0%
you you can get it at a lower price they
 
03:09:05.870 --> 03:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
did it does say
 
03:09:10.250 --> 03:09:10.260 align:start position:0%
work session for the whole committee so
 
03:09:12.769 --> 03:09:12.779 align:start position:0%
I understand this subcommittee is
 
03:09:18.889 --> 03:09:18.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:18.899 --> 03:09:22.550 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:09:22.550 --> 03:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:25.429 --> 03:09:25.439 align:start position:0%
um I if I'm not mistaken I think the uh
 
03:09:27.410 --> 03:09:27.420 align:start position:0%
the chairman asked me to lead this one
 
03:09:29.330 --> 03:09:29.340 align:start position:0%
up since he's not here I'm going to do
 
03:09:31.969 --> 03:09:31.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:34.790 --> 03:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
um but um I think this is going to be
 
03:09:36.769 --> 03:09:36.779 align:start position:0%
sort of an organizational meeting and I
 
03:09:37.790 --> 03:09:37.800 align:start position:0%
think there's going to be several more
 
03:09:37.800 --> 03:09:38.990 align:start position:0%
think there's going to be several more
coming

03:09:38.990 --> 03:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
coming
 
03:09:40.969 --> 03:09:40.979 align:start position:0%
um uh come September
 
03:09:43.730 --> 03:09:43.740 align:start position:0%
um the speaker has yet again uh shut
 
03:09:46.090 --> 03:09:46.100 align:start position:0%
down the state house for the months of
 
03:09:48.530 --> 03:09:48.540 align:start position:0%
July and August and this time I
 
03:09:50.090 --> 03:09:50.100 align:start position:0%
understand that this is not a committee
 
03:09:52.849 --> 03:09:52.859 align:start position:0%
that can meet during July and August
 
03:09:54.950 --> 03:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
um so um
 
03:09:54.960 --> 03:10:01.610 align:start position:0%
um so um
so

03:10:01.610 --> 03:10:01.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:01.620 --> 03:10:07.070 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:10:07.070 --> 03:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:08.990 --> 03:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
where we start
 
03:10:09.000 --> 03:10:10.130 align:start position:0%
where we start
um

03:10:10.130 --> 03:10:10.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:13.670 --> 03:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
but the purpose for retaining one of the
 
03:10:15.710 --> 03:10:15.720 align:start position:0%
reasons was just to let people who are
 
03:10:18.950 --> 03:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
interested in um uh speaking up and
 
03:10:20.870 --> 03:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
getting their perspectives across good
 
03:10:23.090 --> 03:10:23.100 align:start position:0%
give them a chance because frankly when
 
03:10:25.250 --> 03:10:25.260 align:start position:0%
we had the study committee it started
 
03:10:28.130 --> 03:10:28.140 align:start position:0%
quite late we ended up getting a
 
03:10:30.410 --> 03:10:30.420 align:start position:0%
sidelined for two critical months of
 
03:10:32.750 --> 03:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
July and August and
 
03:10:34.490 --> 03:10:34.500 align:start position:0%
um we ended up having to conclude
 
03:10:38.269 --> 03:10:38.279 align:start position:0%
without hearing from the various groups
 
03:10:39.830 --> 03:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
that might be affected by this again
 
03:10:42.950 --> 03:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
it's public sector OSHA so essentially
 
03:10:46.969 --> 03:10:46.979 align:start position:0%
it's going to take the OSHA safety
 
03:10:46.979 --> 03:10:47.769 align:start position:0%
it's going to take the OSHA safety
um

03:10:47.769 --> 03:10:47.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:51.889 --> 03:10:51.899 align:start position:0%
standards section 1910
 
03:10:51.899 --> 03:10:52.490 align:start position:0%
standards section 1910
um

03:10:52.490 --> 03:10:52.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:56.330 --> 03:10:56.340 align:start position:0%
to and and which applies to all private
 
03:10:58.010 --> 03:10:58.020 align:start position:0%
sector workers in the state
 
03:10:59.809 --> 03:10:59.819 align:start position:0%
and apply it to the public sector
 
03:10:59.819 --> 03:11:01.130 align:start position:0%
and apply it to the public sector
workers

03:11:01.130 --> 03:11:01.140 align:start position:0%
workers
 
03:11:04.690 --> 03:11:04.700 align:start position:0%
it does not invite OSHA into
 
03:11:07.670 --> 03:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire it just invites their
 
03:11:10.250 --> 03:11:10.260 align:start position:0%
standards so it will still be the
 
03:11:13.070 --> 03:11:13.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor that does the
 
03:11:13.080 --> 03:11:14.650 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor that does the
inspections

03:11:14.650 --> 03:11:14.660 align:start position:0%
inspections
 
03:11:17.870 --> 03:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
works with public sector employees the
 
03:11:19.730 --> 03:11:19.740 align:start position:0%
way they always have
 
03:11:22.010 --> 03:11:22.020 align:start position:0%
and but they'll simply have a more
 
03:11:24.889 --> 03:11:24.899 align:start position:0%
up-to-date set of Standards I think in
 
03:11:26.690 --> 03:11:26.700 align:start position:0%
earlier conversations
 
03:11:29.690 --> 03:11:29.700 align:start position:0%
um with the Deputy Commissioner
 
03:11:32.030 --> 03:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
um I think we've acknowledged that it's
 
03:11:36.170 --> 03:11:36.180 align:start position:0%
been over 10 years since the Department
 
03:11:38.090 --> 03:11:38.100 align:start position:0%
of Labor safety standards have been
 
03:11:40.490 --> 03:11:40.500 align:start position:0%
reviewed and upgraded
 
03:11:43.130 --> 03:11:43.140 align:start position:0%
um so it's clear that that's something
 
03:11:45.710 --> 03:11:45.720 align:start position:0%
that's not working right now and rather
 
03:11:45.720 --> 03:11:46.610 align:start position:0%
that's not working right now and rather
than

03:11:46.610 --> 03:11:46.620 align:start position:0%
than
 
03:11:46.620 --> 03:11:47.349 align:start position:0%
than
um

03:11:47.349 --> 03:11:47.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:11:50.330 --> 03:11:50.340 align:start position:0%
engage in an effort to upgrade all those
 
03:11:53.269 --> 03:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
we can simply take the private sector
 
03:11:55.370 --> 03:11:55.380 align:start position:0%
OSHA standards and apply them to the
 
03:11:58.550 --> 03:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
public sector and when they get upgraded
 
03:12:01.429 --> 03:12:01.439 align:start position:0%
the private public sector standards for
 
03:12:03.410 --> 03:12:03.420 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire will automatically get
 
03:12:03.420 --> 03:12:05.330 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire will automatically get
upgraded

03:12:05.330 --> 03:12:05.340 align:start position:0%
upgraded
 
03:12:05.340 --> 03:12:06.469 align:start position:0%
upgraded
um

03:12:06.469 --> 03:12:06.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:12:06.479 --> 03:12:08.750 align:start position:0%
um
so

03:12:08.750 --> 03:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:12:11.090 --> 03:12:11.100 align:start position:0%
the groups that I'm anticipating hearing
 
03:12:14.150 --> 03:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
from I know commissioner erlinghaus is I
 
03:12:16.790 --> 03:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
think in finances he's
 
03:12:19.429 --> 03:12:19.439 align:start position:0%
no my physical committee yeah that's
 
03:12:21.349 --> 03:12:21.359 align:start position:0%
right that's a Friday thing
 
03:12:23.870 --> 03:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
um so he will he will try to drop in uh
 
03:12:26.090 --> 03:12:26.100 align:start position:0%
as he has a chance but the department of
 
03:12:28.309 --> 03:12:28.319 align:start position:0%
administrative surfaces definitely has
 
03:12:30.769 --> 03:12:30.779 align:start position:0%
an interest I know the county is is
 
03:12:33.910 --> 03:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
expressed interest in
 
03:12:37.550 --> 03:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
this issue I would anticipate that the
 
03:12:41.389 --> 03:12:41.399 align:start position:0%
um Municipal Association would also be
 
03:12:44.990 --> 03:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
interested as might the schools the fire
 
03:12:46.429 --> 03:12:46.439 align:start position:0%
and police
 
03:12:46.439 --> 03:12:47.570 align:start position:0%
and police
um

03:12:47.570 --> 03:12:47.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:12:48.710 --> 03:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
um are there other groups that I'm
 
03:12:52.370 --> 03:12:52.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:57.349 --> 03:12:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:59.630 --> 03:12:59.640 align:start position:0%
and that's National
 
03:13:02.870 --> 03:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
um so I I don't know a few gentlemen are
 
03:13:04.969 --> 03:13:04.979 align:start position:0%
here to provide input or just to listen
 
03:13:07.309 --> 03:13:07.319 align:start position:0%
but if you're interested in input and
 
03:13:09.290 --> 03:13:09.300 align:start position:0%
I'm not quite sure which organization
 
03:13:18.830 --> 03:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:20.929 --> 03:13:20.939 align:start position:0%
I'm David Ross from Hillsborough County
 
03:13:23.929 --> 03:13:23.939 align:start position:0%
I'm representing the nursing homes for
 
03:13:26.690 --> 03:13:26.700 align:start position:0%
the the County Association
 
03:13:28.309 --> 03:13:28.319 align:start position:0%
um we were definitely would like to be
 
03:13:30.769 --> 03:13:30.779 align:start position:0%
participative in this process
 
03:13:33.650 --> 03:13:33.660 align:start position:0%
um the incorporation of these standards
 
03:13:36.110 --> 03:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
into the health care sector will be
 
03:13:39.469 --> 03:13:39.479 align:start position:0%
meaningful and impactful for us some
 
03:13:41.269 --> 03:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
things that we really would want to
 
03:13:41.279 --> 03:13:42.710 align:start position:0%
things that we really would want to
consider

03:13:42.710 --> 03:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
consider
 
03:13:44.630 --> 03:13:44.640 align:start position:0%
um is the opportunity for us to be able
 
03:13:47.150 --> 03:13:47.160 align:start position:0%
to articulate really what some of the
 
03:13:49.849 --> 03:13:49.859 align:start position:0%
specific impacts would be we have to go
 
03:13:51.110 --> 03:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
through those a little bit more in
 
03:13:52.849 --> 03:13:52.859 align:start position:0%
detail to be able to give you that I'm
 
03:13:54.110 --> 03:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
not prepared to give you that detail
 
03:13:54.120 --> 03:13:55.150 align:start position:0%
not prepared to give you that detail
today

03:13:55.150 --> 03:13:55.160 align:start position:0%
today
 
03:13:57.590 --> 03:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
but also the timeline for implementation
 
03:14:00.290 --> 03:14:00.300 align:start position:0%
in the bill as it was proposed the
 
03:14:01.790 --> 03:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
implementation date was going to be 60
 
03:14:04.910 --> 03:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
days from from passage and incorporating
 
03:14:06.469 --> 03:14:06.479 align:start position:0%
that timeline certainly wouldn't be
 
03:14:10.250 --> 03:14:10.260 align:start position:0%
feasible for us with any meaningful
 
03:14:14.090 --> 03:14:14.100 align:start position:0%
possibility so we'd like to be engaged
 
03:14:16.250 --> 03:14:16.260 align:start position:0%
in this discussion if that's okay and I
 
03:14:19.309 --> 03:14:19.319 align:start position:0%
know that the effective date has been a
 
03:14:20.769 --> 03:14:20.779 align:start position:0%
subject of
 
03:14:23.570 --> 03:14:23.580 align:start position:0%
in-depth discussion and I don't think 60
 
03:14:26.690 --> 03:14:26.700 align:start position:0%
days was uh likely to be a part of that
 
03:14:28.790 --> 03:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
that consideration I I think we were
 
03:14:31.670 --> 03:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
looking at it substantially later uh
 
03:14:33.889 --> 03:14:33.899 align:start position:0%
implementation date
 
03:14:35.809 --> 03:14:35.819 align:start position:0%
um and there's uh
 
03:14:38.510 --> 03:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
just some questions to um you know
 
03:14:42.710 --> 03:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
exactly what the best mark would be
 
03:14:45.590 --> 03:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
um so we welcome having you here and
 
03:14:49.130 --> 03:14:49.140 align:start position:0%
have you received a copy of the uh the
 
03:14:50.929 --> 03:14:50.939 align:start position:0%
file that the Department of Labor has
 
03:14:53.210 --> 03:14:53.220 align:start position:0%
put together with the side by side for
 
03:14:55.550 --> 03:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
1910. we do have that yes yep so we're
 
03:14:57.110 --> 03:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
currently going through that now to be
 
03:14:58.670 --> 03:14:58.680 align:start position:0%
able to take a look at that and see if
 
03:15:00.769 --> 03:15:00.779 align:start position:0%
we can identify from a facilities
 
03:15:02.570 --> 03:15:02.580 align:start position:0%
perspective what those impacts would be
 
03:15:04.190 --> 03:15:04.200 align:start position:0%
and then what the cost implications may
 
03:15:06.410 --> 03:15:06.420 align:start position:0%
be as well okay that's great thank you
 
03:15:07.490 --> 03:15:07.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:15:09.469 --> 03:15:09.479 align:start position:0%
does anybody else have questions or
 
03:15:15.769 --> 03:15:15.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:17.990 --> 03:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
so the tell me what you're using now
 
03:15:20.990 --> 03:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
because a private nursing homes or in
 
03:15:21.769 --> 03:15:21.779 align:start position:0%
the ocean
 
03:15:23.870 --> 03:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
and there's a separate standard as I
 
03:15:28.250 --> 03:15:28.260 align:start position:0%
understand for uh for nursing homes
 
03:15:30.590 --> 03:15:30.600 align:start position:0%
so tell me what what are you currently
 
03:15:33.290 --> 03:15:33.300 align:start position:0%
following are you following the the uh
 
03:15:36.769 --> 03:15:36.779 align:start position:0%
stuff from Rudy and from a DOL or you
 
03:15:39.830 --> 03:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
have accessing a national statement yeah
 
03:15:41.990 --> 03:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
so we follow a combination of Standards
 
03:15:43.490 --> 03:15:43.500 align:start position:0%
so we follow
 
03:15:44.570 --> 03:15:44.580 align:start position:0%
um certainly the department of labor
 
03:15:47.710 --> 03:15:47.720 align:start position:0%
standards that are in existence and also
 
03:15:50.510 --> 03:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
standards that are established by the
 
03:15:52.790 --> 03:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
center for Medicare Medicaid services
 
03:15:55.870 --> 03:15:55.880 align:start position:0%
CMS we have to follow CDC guidelines
 
03:15:58.250 --> 03:15:58.260 align:start position:0%
they incorporate references to National
 
03:16:00.650 --> 03:16:00.660 align:start position:0%
standards as well we have to follow
 
03:16:03.410 --> 03:16:03.420 align:start position:0%
emergency preparedness standards which
 
03:16:05.410 --> 03:16:05.420 align:start position:0%
impact um you know life safety
 
03:16:07.929 --> 03:16:07.939 align:start position:0%
compliance with life safety codes
 
03:16:10.849 --> 03:16:10.859 align:start position:0%
but the OSHA standards that are
 
03:16:12.250 --> 03:16:12.260 align:start position:0%
referenced here
 
03:16:15.290 --> 03:16:15.300 align:start position:0%
incorporate very specific and targeted
 
03:16:17.990 --> 03:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
changes that are not consistent with
 
03:16:19.429 --> 03:16:19.439 align:start position:0%
current policies and procedures within
 
03:16:20.690 --> 03:16:20.700 align:start position:0%
our facilities
 
03:16:22.250 --> 03:16:22.260 align:start position:0%
the private sector you're absolutely
 
03:16:25.389 --> 03:16:25.399 align:start position:0%
right does something very different so
 
03:16:27.889 --> 03:16:27.899 align:start position:0%
they've Incorporated those from the
 
03:16:31.130 --> 03:16:31.140 align:start position:0%
get-go so our organizations have really
 
03:16:32.330 --> 03:16:32.340 align:start position:0%
been established on a different
 
03:16:34.370 --> 03:16:34.380 align:start position:0%
foundation so we have to really create a
 
03:16:36.170 --> 03:16:36.180 align:start position:0%
different structure to be able to ensure
 
03:16:36.180 --> 03:16:38.630 align:start position:0%
different structure to be able to ensure
compliance

03:16:38.630 --> 03:16:38.640 align:start position:0%
compliance
 
03:16:43.070 --> 03:16:43.080 align:start position:0%
follow-up so the uh the standards that
 
03:16:45.590 --> 03:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
you referred to do you have any sense
 
03:16:47.210 --> 03:16:47.220 align:start position:0%
that they
 
03:16:49.070 --> 03:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
um they're more specific to your reading
 
03:16:49.080 --> 03:16:50.330 align:start position:0%
um they're more specific to your reading
stream

03:16:50.330 --> 03:16:50.340 align:start position:0%
stream
 
03:16:52.309 --> 03:16:52.319 align:start position:0%
um do you have any sense of how they
 
03:16:55.250 --> 03:16:55.260 align:start position:0%
when you put them side by side I mean is
 
03:16:59.870 --> 03:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
there should we carve out for instance
 
03:17:02.210 --> 03:17:02.220 align:start position:0%
or just reference you know the the
 
03:17:03.710 --> 03:17:03.720 align:start position:0%
standards you were referring to now
 
03:17:05.630 --> 03:17:05.640 align:start position:0%
would that does that cover the ground
 
03:17:07.010 --> 03:17:07.020 align:start position:0%
does it
 
03:17:09.590 --> 03:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
more specific to our industry as opposed
 
03:17:11.389 --> 03:17:11.399 align:start position:0%
to something like this we would
 
03:17:13.070 --> 03:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
certainly appreciate that
 
03:17:14.450 --> 03:17:14.460 align:start position:0%
um I think that that would certainly
 
03:17:16.190 --> 03:17:16.200 align:start position:0%
make it very specific
 
03:17:17.510 --> 03:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
um and helpful for us because it
 
03:17:19.610 --> 03:17:19.620 align:start position:0%
wouldn't require some substantial change
 
03:17:23.030 --> 03:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
for us the OSHA standards reference on
 
03:17:27.410 --> 03:17:27.420 align:start position:0%
very specific implementation standards
 
03:17:29.630 --> 03:17:29.640 align:start position:0%
um and things that reference
 
03:17:32.150 --> 03:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
specifically targeted education that
 
03:17:32.160 --> 03:17:33.769 align:start position:0%
specifically targeted education that
encompers

03:17:33.769 --> 03:17:33.779 align:start position:0%
encompers
 
03:17:35.990 --> 03:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
um very specific topics
 
03:17:38.630 --> 03:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
um referencing specific signage within
 
03:17:40.969 --> 03:17:40.979 align:start position:0%
facilities different policies and
 
03:17:42.590 --> 03:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
procedures that are not specifically
 
03:17:45.110 --> 03:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
referenced in our existing policies or
 
03:17:47.510 --> 03:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
in the Life Safety Code so we would have
 
03:17:49.250 --> 03:17:49.260 align:start position:0%
to go back and you know Implement those
 
03:17:52.010 --> 03:17:52.020 align:start position:0%
things not that it's a bad thing it's
 
03:17:55.370 --> 03:17:55.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:57.230 --> 03:17:57.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:18:00.650 --> 03:18:00.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:02.389 --> 03:18:02.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Ross
 
03:18:09.190 --> 03:18:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:19.870 --> 03:18:19.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:21.710 --> 03:18:21.720 align:start position:0%
Rudy and I have had a couple of
 
03:18:21.720 --> 03:18:22.969 align:start position:0%
Rudy and I have had a couple of
conversations

03:18:22.969 --> 03:18:22.979 align:start position:0%
conversations
 
03:18:22.979 --> 03:18:23.870 align:start position:0%
conversations
um

03:18:23.870 --> 03:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:27.110 --> 03:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
one of which I thoroughly confused him
 
03:18:28.570 --> 03:18:28.580 align:start position:0%
um and I think
 
03:18:32.510 --> 03:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
earlier today maybe I uh did away with
 
03:18:36.530 --> 03:18:36.540 align:start position:0%
confusion I was I and might go into this
 
03:18:38.269 --> 03:18:38.279 align:start position:0%
again when commissioner erlinghaus comes
 
03:18:42.590 --> 03:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
up if if he makes it but I was talking
 
03:18:44.650 --> 03:18:44.660 align:start position:0%
with some weeks ago
 
03:18:47.090 --> 03:18:47.100 align:start position:0%
Joyce Pittman who is also with the
 
03:18:49.490 --> 03:18:49.500 align:start position:0%
dominant Department of administrative
 
03:18:49.500 --> 03:18:51.170 align:start position:0%
dominant Department of administrative
Services

03:18:51.170 --> 03:18:51.180 align:start position:0%
Services
 
03:18:53.630 --> 03:18:53.640 align:start position:0%
um approached me saying that um
 
03:18:55.670 --> 03:18:55.680 align:start position:0%
you know they're responsible for all of
 
03:18:57.769 --> 03:18:57.779 align:start position:0%
the Departments and agencies in the
 
03:19:00.290 --> 03:19:00.300 align:start position:0%
state and she was concerned that they
 
03:19:03.110 --> 03:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
might need some help with figuring out
 
03:19:05.030 --> 03:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
exactly what
 
03:19:05.040 --> 03:19:06.050 align:start position:0%
exactly what
um

03:19:06.050 --> 03:19:06.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:19:07.910 --> 03:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
what they need to do to make adjustments
 
03:19:07.920 --> 03:19:09.710 align:start position:0%
what they need to do to make adjustments
and

03:19:09.710 --> 03:19:09.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:19:11.929 --> 03:19:11.939 align:start position:0%
um we're looking for some consultant
 
03:19:15.050 --> 03:19:15.060 align:start position:0%
assistants and um
 
03:19:15.060 --> 03:19:16.550 align:start position:0%
assistants and um
the

03:19:16.550 --> 03:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:19:18.889 --> 03:19:18.899 align:start position:0%
when I was talking to Rudy he thought I
 
03:19:21.349 --> 03:19:21.359 align:start position:0%
was referring to a consultancy program
 
03:19:23.330 --> 03:19:23.340 align:start position:0%
which is part of the state plan which
 
03:19:26.950 --> 03:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
we're not doing so basically
 
03:19:29.210 --> 03:19:29.220 align:start position:0%
what I am hoping
 
03:19:31.630 --> 03:19:31.640 align:start position:0%
um and I think Miss Pippin who's hoping
 
03:19:34.849 --> 03:19:34.859 align:start position:0%
is that the department might be able to
 
03:19:34.859 --> 03:19:35.750 align:start position:0%
is that the department might be able to
um

03:19:35.750 --> 03:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:19:38.510 --> 03:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
you know if we get this passed the
 
03:19:40.309 --> 03:19:40.319 align:start position:0%
department might be able to assist some
 
03:19:44.510 --> 03:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
of the uh public sector groups with some
 
03:19:44.520 --> 03:19:46.870 align:start position:0%
of the uh public sector groups with some
consultant

03:19:46.870 --> 03:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
consultant
 
03:19:50.150 --> 03:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
assistance with making that transition I
 
03:19:53.389 --> 03:19:53.399 align:start position:0%
don't know if you can speak to that Rudy
 
03:19:55.610 --> 03:19:55.620 align:start position:0%
um thank you so yeah I was confused no
 
03:19:57.830 --> 03:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
it was my fault not yours
 
03:19:57.840 --> 03:19:59.750 align:start position:0%
it was my fault not yours
um

03:19:59.750 --> 03:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:20:02.090 --> 03:20:02.100 align:start position:0%
we would have to just look in terms of
 
03:20:04.130 --> 03:20:04.140 align:start position:0%
the level of effort of that so we would
 
03:20:06.290 --> 03:20:06.300 align:start position:0%
certainly always look to assist any
 
03:20:08.450 --> 03:20:08.460 align:start position:0%
employer if they're saying hey I have
 
03:20:10.370 --> 03:20:10.380 align:start position:0%
compliance questions
 
03:20:12.170 --> 03:20:12.180 align:start position:0%
um that's presently what we do on a
 
03:20:14.210 --> 03:20:14.220 align:start position:0%
one-off type of capacity is like when we
 
03:20:17.090 --> 03:20:17.100 align:start position:0%
go in and perform an inspection if they
 
03:20:19.010 --> 03:20:19.020 align:start position:0%
say here are our issues here are
 
03:20:22.190 --> 03:20:22.200 align:start position:0%
concerns we work with them now if
 
03:20:24.590 --> 03:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
they're talking about a uh kind of a
 
03:20:27.349 --> 03:20:27.359 align:start position:0%
across the state type level of effort it
 
03:20:30.349 --> 03:20:30.359 align:start position:0%
would take a long time to do all
 
03:20:33.650 --> 03:20:33.660 align:start position:0%
agencies we could certainly handle you
 
03:20:35.870 --> 03:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
know like an agency comes to us and says
 
03:20:37.910 --> 03:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
here's our operation here's what we're
 
03:20:40.610 --> 03:20:40.620 align:start position:0%
doing slash not doing
 
03:20:42.469 --> 03:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
um so it's something to think about I
 
03:20:43.910 --> 03:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
mean I guess I would be interested in
 
03:20:45.889 --> 03:20:45.899 align:start position:0%
terms of when she's saying that is what
 
03:20:47.690 --> 03:20:47.700 align:start position:0%
timeline is she thinking of is she
 
03:20:49.070 --> 03:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
thinking of like again like a
 
03:20:52.429 --> 03:20:52.439 align:start position:0%
prospective look at the 60 some odd
 
03:20:54.950 --> 03:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
boards and agencies and say are they
 
03:20:56.929 --> 03:20:56.939 align:start position:0%
good to go not good to go or is she
 
03:20:58.670 --> 03:20:58.680 align:start position:0%
thinking like we
 
03:21:01.250 --> 03:21:01.260 align:start position:0%
stagger that out in terms of you know go
 
03:21:03.590 --> 03:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
through them at some type of pace but in
 
03:21:05.870 --> 03:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
a general sense the consultancy or
 
03:21:07.849 --> 03:21:07.859 align:start position:0%
working with employers on coming into
 
03:21:09.290 --> 03:21:09.300 align:start position:0%
compliance is something we're
 
03:21:11.990 --> 03:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
comfortable with providing training is
 
03:21:14.330 --> 03:21:14.340 align:start position:0%
something we're comfortable with I guess
 
03:21:16.670 --> 03:21:16.680 align:start position:0%
just in terms of what is the timeline or
 
03:21:19.130 --> 03:21:19.140 align:start position:0%
expectation so that would be something
 
03:21:21.050 --> 03:21:21.060 align:start position:0%
we would want to look at and be sorted
 
03:21:23.269 --> 03:21:23.279 align:start position:0%
out right that might also play into
 
03:21:27.110 --> 03:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
where we pick the implementation date
 
03:21:27.120 --> 03:21:28.309 align:start position:0%
where we pick the implementation date
um

03:21:28.309 --> 03:21:28.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:31.190 --> 03:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
where would the department be at with
 
03:21:32.269 --> 03:21:32.279 align:start position:0%
regard to
 
03:21:32.279 --> 03:21:32.870 align:start position:0%
regard to
um

03:21:32.870 --> 03:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:35.090 --> 03:21:35.100 align:start position:0%
I mean I've said over and over again
 
03:21:37.190 --> 03:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
that I've never considered our
 
03:21:39.469 --> 03:21:39.479 align:start position:0%
department of labor to be a punitive
 
03:21:40.969 --> 03:21:40.979 align:start position:0%
um entity
 
03:21:44.929 --> 03:21:44.939 align:start position:0%
um you know got a gotcha type of entity
 
03:21:49.309 --> 03:21:49.319 align:start position:0%
um so if um if uh public and some of the
 
03:21:51.530 --> 03:21:51.540 align:start position:0%
public employers were still
 
03:21:54.950 --> 03:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
learning and making transitions after
 
03:21:57.889 --> 03:21:57.899 align:start position:0%
um after the implementation date how
 
03:22:00.230 --> 03:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
would the department deal with that
 
03:22:02.330 --> 03:22:02.340 align:start position:0%
probably similar to how we deal with
 
03:22:04.910 --> 03:22:04.920 align:start position:0%
them now which is again to be clear we
 
03:22:06.889 --> 03:22:06.899 align:start position:0%
go in and deal with employers now who
 
03:22:09.530 --> 03:22:09.540 align:start position:0%
are not in compliance with existing
 
03:22:11.570 --> 03:22:11.580 align:start position:0%
standard and the way that we deal with
 
03:22:14.210 --> 03:22:14.220 align:start position:0%
them is those violations are cited that
 
03:22:17.389 --> 03:22:17.399 align:start position:0%
there's an a period for remediation and
 
03:22:19.730 --> 03:22:19.740 align:start position:0%
our civil penalties relative to safety
 
03:22:22.429 --> 03:22:22.439 align:start position:0%
are incredibly low usually we held the
 
03:22:24.889 --> 03:22:24.899 align:start position:0%
penalties uh civil penalties for safety
 
03:22:27.710 --> 03:22:27.720 align:start position:0%
violations are held in abeyance allowing
 
03:22:30.650 --> 03:22:30.660 align:start position:0%
the employer to go through a remediation
 
03:22:30.660 --> 03:22:32.870 align:start position:0%
the employer to go through a remediation
process

03:22:32.870 --> 03:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
process
 
03:22:35.090 --> 03:22:35.100 align:start position:0%
and I I think
 
03:22:37.450 --> 03:22:37.460 align:start position:0%
some of the fear that we've
 
03:22:41.090 --> 03:22:41.100 align:start position:0%
experienced with the study committee and
 
03:22:44.150 --> 03:22:44.160 align:start position:0%
also the um uh
 
03:22:48.590 --> 03:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
the earlier subcommittee I think is
 
03:22:50.330 --> 03:22:50.340 align:start position:0%
based on a fear that the
 
03:22:52.550 --> 03:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
that we're they're going to be facing
 
03:22:56.090 --> 03:22:56.100 align:start position:0%
OSHA's um penalties which isn't true
 
03:22:57.590 --> 03:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
because it's Department of Labor that's
 
03:22:59.570 --> 03:22:59.580 align:start position:0%
going to be implementing this and I
 
03:23:01.309 --> 03:23:01.319 align:start position:0%
think they're fearful that there's going
 
03:23:03.230 --> 03:23:03.240 align:start position:0%
to be some gotcha activity going on and
 
03:23:05.389 --> 03:23:05.399 align:start position:0%
I've never
 
03:23:07.309 --> 03:23:07.319 align:start position:0%
never had that impression exactly what
 
03:23:09.769 --> 03:23:09.779 align:start position:0%
you said is what we've always believed
 
03:23:12.950 --> 03:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
is the case so people I mean essentially
 
03:23:15.110 --> 03:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
a violation would be an opportunity to
 
03:23:17.809 --> 03:23:17.819 align:start position:0%
uh to make an adjustment and learn
 
03:23:21.110 --> 03:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
correct yep um
 
03:23:23.030 --> 03:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
anyone else have questions along those
 
03:23:23.040 --> 03:23:28.190 align:start position:0%
anyone else have questions along those
lines

03:23:28.190 --> 03:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:30.410 --> 03:23:30.420 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner
 
03:23:33.650 --> 03:23:33.660 align:start position:0%
so when I'm trying to get my arms around
 
03:23:38.210 --> 03:23:38.220 align:start position:0%
is uh the scope of this the scope of the
 
03:23:38.220 --> 03:23:39.590 align:start position:0%
is uh the scope of this the scope of the
uh

03:23:39.590 --> 03:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:23:39.600 --> 03:23:41.110 align:start position:0%
uh
of this

03:23:41.110 --> 03:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
of this
 
03:23:44.030 --> 03:23:44.040 align:start position:0%
trying to match these two
 
03:23:46.070 --> 03:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
kind of Standards so you have the
 
03:23:48.469 --> 03:23:48.479 align:start position:0%
current standard which I would assume is
 
03:23:52.010 --> 03:23:52.020 align:start position:0%
a product of the DOL and the rules and
 
03:23:53.630 --> 03:23:53.640 align:start position:0%
ranks and all that's what's been
 
03:23:55.729 --> 03:23:55.739 align:start position:0%
developed over a period of time
 
03:23:58.190 --> 03:23:58.200 align:start position:0%
and then we were hearing from others who
 
03:24:00.370 --> 03:24:00.380 align:start position:0%
were saying well it's such a big
 
03:24:04.010 --> 03:24:04.020 align:start position:0%
undertaking to comply to comply with the
 
03:24:07.370 --> 03:24:07.380 align:start position:0%
OSHA standard and at some point we're
 
03:24:09.830 --> 03:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
going to have to reconcile those things
 
03:24:12.170 --> 03:24:12.180 align:start position:0%
there's going to have to be
 
03:24:14.690 --> 03:24:14.700 align:start position:0%
um you know some some way of measuring
 
03:24:17.690 --> 03:24:17.700 align:start position:0%
so where are you on the scale of things
 
03:24:20.030 --> 03:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
so where is the you know this department
 
03:24:23.150 --> 03:24:23.160 align:start position:0%
of the state on in terms of you know so
 
03:24:24.349 --> 03:24:24.359 align:start position:0%
to me
 
03:24:26.389 --> 03:24:26.399 align:start position:0%
we don't know what the scope of it so
 
03:24:28.610 --> 03:24:28.620 align:start position:0%
it's easy and I was a lobbyist for a
 
03:24:30.170 --> 03:24:30.180 align:start position:0%
long time because easier said it's going
 
03:24:31.969 --> 03:24:31.979 align:start position:0%
to cost us all this money but you got to
 
03:24:34.490 --> 03:24:34.500 align:start position:0%
quantify that and that's what I think is
 
03:24:36.830 --> 03:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
going to be the challenge uh and quite
 
03:24:38.210 --> 03:24:38.220 align:start position:0%
frankly I
 
03:24:41.030 --> 03:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
we know what the standard is uh it's out
 
03:24:41.040 --> 03:24:42.290 align:start position:0%
we know what the standard is uh it's out
there

03:24:42.290 --> 03:24:42.300 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:24:43.910 --> 03:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
um and so if somebody comes into this
 
03:24:46.190 --> 03:24:46.200 align:start position:0%
committee I hope that you can help them
 
03:24:47.690 --> 03:24:47.700 align:start position:0%
and others can help them begin the
 
03:24:49.490 --> 03:24:49.500 align:start position:0%
process of identifying
 
03:24:51.889 --> 03:24:51.899 align:start position:0%
so where is the conflict where where are
 
03:24:54.110 --> 03:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
the big areas that we are going to be
 
03:24:56.210 --> 03:24:56.220 align:start position:0%
problematic as we move forward
 
03:24:59.389 --> 03:24:59.399 align:start position:0%
and I don't know how big that is
 
03:25:02.929 --> 03:25:02.939 align:start position:0%
I I think you have identified uh the as
 
03:25:04.670 --> 03:25:04.680 align:start position:0%
this conversation has gone on one thing
 
03:25:06.650 --> 03:25:06.660 align:start position:0%
that has continually come up is it is
 
03:25:09.050 --> 03:25:09.060 align:start position:0%
difficult to quantify and certainly
 
03:25:11.750 --> 03:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
qualify those costs
 
03:25:13.790 --> 03:25:13.800 align:start position:0%
um what I have tried to say um
 
03:25:15.889 --> 03:25:15.899 align:start position:0%
consistently is that there are
 
03:25:18.170 --> 03:25:18.180 align:start position:0%
significant differences and mainly it's
 
03:25:19.910 --> 03:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
the gentleman who spoke uh before me I
 
03:25:22.309 --> 03:25:22.319 align:start position:0%
think spoke very well it's really a lack
 
03:25:25.250 --> 03:25:25.260 align:start position:0%
of specificity uh our current standards
 
03:25:28.670 --> 03:25:28.680 align:start position:0%
are very uh non-specific they are very
 
03:25:31.130 --> 03:25:31.140 align:start position:0%
general uh something I have said in the
 
03:25:33.050 --> 03:25:33.060 align:start position:0%
past is that does not mean that there
 
03:25:35.690 --> 03:25:35.700 align:start position:0%
are no standards it just means that when
 
03:25:37.550 --> 03:25:37.560 align:start position:0%
we run across we're typically working
 
03:25:40.309 --> 03:25:40.319 align:start position:0%
backwards and what I mean by that is if
 
03:25:42.710 --> 03:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
we go into an employer after there has
 
03:25:45.050 --> 03:25:45.060 align:start position:0%
been a safety concern
 
03:25:47.389 --> 03:25:47.399 align:start position:0%
we would look at it and say okay we
 
03:25:49.670 --> 03:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
don't have a specific standard on what
 
03:25:51.830 --> 03:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
occurred or what didn't occur but we
 
03:25:54.229 --> 03:25:54.239 align:start position:0%
have a general duties clause and then
 
03:25:55.910 --> 03:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
when we try and flesh out what the
 
03:25:57.769 --> 03:25:57.779 align:start position:0%
general duty of care would be for that
 
03:26:00.349 --> 03:26:00.359 align:start position:0%
employer we might look to OSHA we might
 
03:26:03.110 --> 03:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
look to CDC we might look to all of
 
03:26:05.150 --> 03:26:05.160 align:start position:0%
these different things and then that's
 
03:26:06.530 --> 03:26:06.540 align:start position:0%
where we come forth with a
 
03:26:08.450 --> 03:26:08.460 align:start position:0%
recommendation to that employer and say
 
03:26:10.750 --> 03:26:10.760 align:start position:0%
hey going forward you had this event
 
03:26:13.429 --> 03:26:13.439 align:start position:0%
going forward you should probably adhere
 
03:26:16.190 --> 03:26:16.200 align:start position:0%
to these types of Standards under your
 
03:26:18.170 --> 03:26:18.180 align:start position:0%
general duty Clause you've identified a
 
03:26:18.180 --> 03:26:19.130 align:start position:0%
general duty Clause you've identified a
hazard

03:26:19.130 --> 03:26:19.140 align:start position:0%
hazard
 
03:26:21.229 --> 03:26:21.239 align:start position:0%
general duty would suggest you follow
 
03:26:23.750 --> 03:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
these established standards but they're
 
03:26:25.670 --> 03:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
not set forth specific in New Hampshire
 
03:26:28.370 --> 03:26:28.380 align:start position:0%
state law so again I'm not just trying
 
03:26:29.990 --> 03:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
to Ramble On and On I think you're
 
03:26:32.210 --> 03:26:32.220 align:start position:0%
absolutely right that it is difficult to
 
03:26:35.090 --> 03:26:35.100 align:start position:0%
say this is going to cost x amount more
 
03:26:38.090 --> 03:26:38.100 align:start position:0%
it's difficult to say that this is going
 
03:26:40.729 --> 03:26:40.739 align:start position:0%
to take this amount of time
 
03:26:43.490 --> 03:26:43.500 align:start position:0%
um but there is a gap the Gap is we are
 
03:26:46.010 --> 03:26:46.020 align:start position:0%
not very specific our standards a lot of
 
03:26:48.229 --> 03:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
times we are referencing a general duty
 
03:26:50.269 --> 03:26:50.279 align:start position:0%
clause and then the general duty Clause
 
03:26:52.429 --> 03:26:52.439 align:start position:0%
we look elsewhere we look to OSHA we
 
03:26:55.309 --> 03:26:55.319 align:start position:0%
look to CDC we look to best industry
 
03:27:00.710 --> 03:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:05.110 --> 03:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:07.550 --> 03:27:07.560 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to get at is do we have
 
03:27:09.710 --> 03:27:09.720 align:start position:0%
to if there are standards that are
 
03:27:11.269 --> 03:27:11.279 align:start position:0%
currently out there that have been
 
03:27:11.279 --> 03:27:12.769 align:start position:0%
currently out there that have been
implemented

03:27:12.769 --> 03:27:12.779 align:start position:0%
implemented
 
03:27:14.750 --> 03:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
um they provide a certain level of
 
03:27:16.969 --> 03:27:16.979 align:start position:0%
safety that are industry standards a
 
03:27:18.769 --> 03:27:18.779 align:start position:0%
prison being one of them you know they
 
03:27:19.910 --> 03:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
have the prisons have their own
 
03:27:23.030 --> 03:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
standards in fact I think they're exempt
 
03:27:24.889 --> 03:27:24.899 align:start position:0%
for motion they're not mistaken
 
03:27:24.899 --> 03:27:26.050 align:start position:0%
for motion they're not mistaken
so

03:27:26.050 --> 03:27:26.060 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:27:29.750 --> 03:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
can those be part of this
 
03:27:29.760 --> 03:27:30.769 align:start position:0%
can those be part of this
um

03:27:30.769 --> 03:27:30.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:27:35.210 --> 03:27:35.220 align:start position:0%
this scheme of developing a uh this
 
03:27:37.250 --> 03:27:37.260 align:start position:0%
whole program of Osha and protections
 
03:27:38.750 --> 03:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
for work and so
 
03:27:41.630 --> 03:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
are do we have to we have to wipe the
 
03:27:43.610 --> 03:27:43.620 align:start position:0%
Slate clean and then Begin Again in
 
03:27:46.490 --> 03:27:46.500 align:start position:0%
building and building all this can I
 
03:27:48.469 --> 03:27:48.479 align:start position:0%
it's a very different approach
 
03:27:52.550 --> 03:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
um the um and Mark since you're new to
 
03:27:56.050 --> 03:27:56.060 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie since you're uh
 
03:27:58.910 --> 03:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
new to this process
 
03:28:01.250 --> 03:28:01.260 align:start position:0%
um back when we had the study committee
 
03:28:03.530 --> 03:28:03.540 align:start position:0%
um the Department of Labor did a ton of
 
03:28:06.650 --> 03:28:06.660 align:start position:0%
work on doing a side-by-side comparison
 
03:28:09.170 --> 03:28:09.180 align:start position:0%
of the department of labor standards
 
03:28:13.429 --> 03:28:13.439 align:start position:0%
and in the um uh not only in 1910 but
 
03:28:15.349 --> 03:28:15.359 align:start position:0%
the other two sets of standards and we
 
03:28:18.050 --> 03:28:18.060 align:start position:0%
concluded the 1910 would be the most
 
03:28:20.870 --> 03:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
applicable one to uh public sector in
 
03:28:23.870 --> 03:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and um and so that's there
 
03:28:27.410 --> 03:28:27.420 align:start position:0%
and every you know that should be a big
 
03:28:29.570 --> 03:28:29.580 align:start position:0%
actually maybe you could just uh send
 
03:28:31.370 --> 03:28:31.380 align:start position:0%
those out to all members of the labor
 
03:28:31.380 --> 03:28:32.389 align:start position:0%
those out to all members of the labor
committee

03:28:32.389 --> 03:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:28:35.150 --> 03:28:35.160 align:start position:0%
yeah we'll sum that out yeah and and it
 
03:28:39.469 --> 03:28:39.479 align:start position:0%
I'll warn you it's a very large file and
 
03:28:41.929 --> 03:28:41.939 align:start position:0%
when you initially open it it opens up
 
03:28:44.510 --> 03:28:44.520 align:start position:0%
completely to I don't remember how many
 
03:28:47.389 --> 03:28:47.399 align:start position:0%
thousands of pages it is but it's it's
 
03:28:51.170 --> 03:28:51.180 align:start position:0%
um it's it's big but once you save it to
 
03:28:53.510 --> 03:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
your hard drive and then reopen it from
 
03:28:54.710 --> 03:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
the hard drive
 
03:28:57.290 --> 03:28:57.300 align:start position:0%
it opens up a table of contents with
 
03:28:59.809 --> 03:28:59.819 align:start position:0%
little bullets and you can you can click
 
03:29:01.490 --> 03:29:01.500 align:start position:0%
on one at a time you experience this did
 
03:29:01.500 --> 03:29:02.769 align:start position:0%
on one at a time you experience this did
you

03:29:02.769 --> 03:29:02.779 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:29:05.330 --> 03:29:05.340 align:start position:0%
it freaks you out to begin with but once
 
03:29:07.790 --> 03:29:07.800 align:start position:0%
you do the save and reopen
 
03:29:10.929 --> 03:29:10.939 align:start position:0%
um you you get a very workable document
 
03:29:14.630 --> 03:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
that does a very nice job of comparison
 
03:29:17.929 --> 03:29:17.939 align:start position:0%
comparing the the OSHA and the
 
03:29:20.510 --> 03:29:20.520 align:start position:0%
department of labor standards so so
 
03:29:22.250 --> 03:29:22.260 align:start position:0%
um that was one of the big pieces of
 
03:29:24.469 --> 03:29:24.479 align:start position:0%
work that needed to be done
 
03:29:26.210 --> 03:29:26.220 align:start position:0%
the Deputy Commissioner very
 
03:29:29.870 --> 03:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
legitimately said that he embraced the
 
03:29:32.150 --> 03:29:32.160 align:start position:0%
idea of doing it but needed to be told
 
03:29:33.590 --> 03:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
he had to do it because it's a big job
 
03:29:33.600 --> 03:29:35.210 align:start position:0%
he had to do it because it's a big job
and

03:29:35.210 --> 03:29:35.220 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:29:37.790 --> 03:29:37.800 align:start position:0%
um I'm witness to the fact that it was a
 
03:29:41.570 --> 03:29:41.580 align:start position:0%
very large job go ahead without being
 
03:29:43.130 --> 03:29:43.140 align:start position:0%
dismissive of those efforts the one
 
03:29:44.750 --> 03:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
thing I want to be clear on and I do
 
03:29:46.370 --> 03:29:46.380 align:start position:0%
Apollo you know to the gentleman behind
 
03:29:48.410 --> 03:29:48.420 align:start position:0%
us and I would acknowledge this when
 
03:29:50.030 --> 03:29:50.040 align:start position:0%
Miss Pittman had brought it up as well
 
03:29:52.490 --> 03:29:52.500 align:start position:0%
to be clear it's not as in-depth or
 
03:29:54.349 --> 03:29:54.359 align:start position:0%
granular as some people would probably
 
03:29:57.410 --> 03:29:57.420 align:start position:0%
want it is showing you OSHA has this
 
03:30:00.050 --> 03:30:00.060 align:start position:0%
section we have nothing OSHA has this
 
03:30:01.849 --> 03:30:01.859 align:start position:0%
section this is what New Hampshire has
 
03:30:06.410 --> 03:30:06.420 align:start position:0%
it does not qualify or say what the
 
03:30:08.030 --> 03:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
differences might mean in terms of
 
03:30:09.889 --> 03:30:09.899 align:start position:0%
operations or costs or anything like
 
03:30:11.510 --> 03:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
that and I only point that out I do
 
03:30:13.550 --> 03:30:13.560 align:start position:0%
think it's a useful document and I you
 
03:30:15.769 --> 03:30:15.779 align:start position:0%
know we did it so I'm not trying to be
 
03:30:18.290 --> 03:30:18.300 align:start position:0%
dismissive of it I just point out that
 
03:30:21.290 --> 03:30:21.300 align:start position:0%
you know I think some folks want more
 
03:30:24.050 --> 03:30:24.060 align:start position:0%
and I acknowledge that it is not it's
 
03:30:26.990 --> 03:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
not like a you know some consultancy
 
03:30:28.490 --> 03:30:28.500 align:start position:0%
prod you know it wasn't that it was put
 
03:30:30.710 --> 03:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
together and it answers all questions
 
03:30:32.570 --> 03:30:32.580 align:start position:0%
uh if that makes sense
 
03:30:35.030 --> 03:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
but it does a very nice job of showing
 
03:30:36.889 --> 03:30:36.899 align:start position:0%
where where we are in comparison and
 
03:30:40.729 --> 03:30:40.739 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's just OSHA word words it
 
03:30:42.410 --> 03:30:42.420 align:start position:0%
one way in Department of Labor words in
 
03:30:43.790 --> 03:30:43.800 align:start position:0%
a different way and you've you've got to
 
03:30:45.410 --> 03:30:45.420 align:start position:0%
sort of stare at it for a while see if
 
03:30:48.650 --> 03:30:48.660 align:start position:0%
it's just uh equivalent or different
 
03:30:50.870 --> 03:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
um but uh but it is a very helpful
 
03:30:54.110 --> 03:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
document and uh very useful and
 
03:30:54.120 --> 03:31:00.110 align:start position:0%
document and uh very useful and
um

03:31:00.110 --> 03:31:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:02.750 --> 03:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
so you so with that and I haven't seen
 
03:31:02.760 --> 03:31:03.769 align:start position:0%
so you so with that and I haven't seen
it

03:31:03.769 --> 03:31:03.779 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:31:03.779 --> 03:31:04.610 align:start position:0%
it
um

03:31:04.610 --> 03:31:04.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:31:08.750 --> 03:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
do you at some point incorporate uh in
 
03:31:11.330 --> 03:31:11.340 align:start position:0%
that process those standards which are
 
03:31:14.210 --> 03:31:14.220 align:start position:0%
currently in place uh for various
 
03:31:16.130 --> 03:31:16.140 align:start position:0%
Industries throughout the state
 
03:31:18.229 --> 03:31:18.239 align:start position:0%
are the other counties whatever the case
 
03:31:19.490 --> 03:31:19.500 align:start position:0%
may be so
 
03:31:21.950 --> 03:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
where there's the OSHA standards is the
 
03:31:26.510 --> 03:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
is the DOL uh stuff but there are also
 
03:31:28.490 --> 03:31:28.500 align:start position:0%
standards that are currently safety and
 
03:31:30.469 --> 03:31:30.479 align:start position:0%
health centers are currently in place to
 
03:31:32.929 --> 03:31:32.939 align:start position:0%
a whole variety of public sector the
 
03:31:36.170 --> 03:31:36.180 align:start position:0%
fire has it the prison Sabbath nursing
 
03:31:40.429 --> 03:31:40.439 align:start position:0%
homes have it so uh you know so what I
 
03:31:41.570 --> 03:31:41.580 align:start position:0%
don't want
 
03:31:44.090 --> 03:31:44.100 align:start position:0%
there's no this there is a gap but I
 
03:31:46.130 --> 03:31:46.140 align:start position:0%
don't know how big that Gap is you know
 
03:31:47.870 --> 03:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to say yeah absolutely
 
03:31:50.269 --> 03:31:50.279 align:start position:0%
and to be clear this document does not
 
03:31:52.670 --> 03:31:52.680 align:start position:0%
pull in those other standards this is
 
03:31:57.190 --> 03:31:57.200 align:start position:0%
literally uh just the 1910 to 1400 or
 
03:32:00.050 --> 03:32:00.060 align:start position:0%
277. it does not reference other
 
03:32:00.060 --> 03:32:01.550 align:start position:0%
277. it does not reference other
standards

03:32:01.550 --> 03:32:01.560 align:start position:0%
standards
 
03:32:03.469 --> 03:32:03.479 align:start position:0%
and and I don't think we wanted to
 
03:32:06.170 --> 03:32:06.180 align:start position:0%
because basically this bill
 
03:32:09.590 --> 03:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
um adopts the 1910 OSHA standards no
 
03:32:10.849 --> 03:32:10.859 align:start position:0%
others I don't think we want to
 
03:32:13.190 --> 03:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
complicate it by I'm bringing all sorts
 
03:32:14.809 --> 03:32:14.819 align:start position:0%
of other organizations and other
 
03:32:16.309 --> 03:32:16.319 align:start position:0%
standards in
 
03:32:18.349 --> 03:32:18.359 align:start position:0%
um the nursing homes may already be
 
03:32:20.269 --> 03:32:20.279 align:start position:0%
subject to
 
03:32:22.490 --> 03:32:22.500 align:start position:0%
um other safety standards through other
 
03:32:24.950 --> 03:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
organizations that
 
03:32:27.950 --> 03:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
um you know are watching them
 
03:32:30.769 --> 03:32:30.779 align:start position:0%
um but this bill is simply adopting the
 
03:32:33.410 --> 03:32:33.420 align:start position:0%
OSHA standards no others
 
03:32:42.050 --> 03:32:42.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:43.370 --> 03:32:43.380 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to think if there's anything
 
03:32:47.090 --> 03:32:47.100 align:start position:0%
else before you take off on us um
 
03:32:48.950 --> 03:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
I had hoped that we'd have more more
 
03:32:51.290 --> 03:32:51.300 align:start position:0%
folks you know showing interest today if
 
03:32:53.690 --> 03:32:53.700 align:start position:0%
it was in the calendar for two weeks but
 
03:32:55.790 --> 03:32:55.800 align:start position:0%
um I haven't seen anything
 
03:32:59.870 --> 03:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
representative Schultz this question May
 
03:33:02.330 --> 03:33:02.340 align:start position:0%
um feel free to to say or help me
 
03:33:04.969 --> 03:33:04.979 align:start position:0%
clarify if this is too broad of a
 
03:33:04.979 --> 03:33:06.710 align:start position:0%
clarify if this is too broad of a
question

03:33:06.710 --> 03:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:33:08.389 --> 03:33:08.399 align:start position:0%
um I think it would be helpful to know
 
03:33:10.790 --> 03:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
since there is already a process from
 
03:33:10.800 --> 03:33:12.349 align:start position:0%
since there is already a process from
your

03:33:12.349 --> 03:33:12.359 align:start position:0%
your
 
03:33:14.110 --> 03:33:14.120 align:start position:0%
um from your department
 
03:33:18.410 --> 03:33:18.420 align:start position:0%
to address those safety standards and
 
03:33:22.130 --> 03:33:22.140 align:start position:0%
all these other areas of the states and
 
03:33:24.530 --> 03:33:24.540 align:start position:0%
to what degree
 
03:33:26.750 --> 03:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
I guess it would be hard to know exactly
 
03:33:29.150 --> 03:33:29.160 align:start position:0%
all the specifics for the new
 
03:33:32.870 --> 03:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
application of that but roughly say how
 
03:33:35.870 --> 03:33:35.880 align:start position:0%
many staff folks do you have working on
 
03:33:38.330 --> 03:33:38.340 align:start position:0%
these issues and do you currently hire
 
03:33:41.929 --> 03:33:41.939 align:start position:0%
any contractors for trainings or
 
03:33:44.349 --> 03:33:44.359 align:start position:0%
investigations like what sort of
 
03:33:47.170 --> 03:33:47.180 align:start position:0%
infrastructure do you have covering
 
03:33:50.389 --> 03:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
workplace safety for what our laws
 
03:33:52.790 --> 03:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
already cover
 
03:33:55.670 --> 03:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
and if that's too broad I'm open to the
 
03:33:58.729 --> 03:33:58.739 align:start position:0%
correct way to ask that
 
03:34:00.590 --> 03:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
no I I think I understand the question
 
03:34:03.290 --> 03:34:03.300 align:start position:0%
so in terms of existing infrastructure
 
03:34:08.630 --> 03:34:08.640 align:start position:0%
the department historically has had uh
 
03:34:12.530 --> 03:34:12.540 align:start position:0%
three to three and a half folks covering
 
03:34:15.530 --> 03:34:15.540 align:start position:0%
safety that's been made up of two
 
03:34:15.540 --> 03:34:17.570 align:start position:0%
safety that's been made up of two
inspectors

03:34:17.570 --> 03:34:17.580 align:start position:0%
inspectors
 
03:34:20.030 --> 03:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
um in administrative slash clerical
 
03:34:23.210 --> 03:34:23.220 align:start position:0%
support staff and then a portion of the
 
03:34:25.910 --> 03:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
director of inspections time in the last
 
03:34:28.309 --> 03:34:28.319 align:start position:0%
either 18 months or 12 months I guess
 
03:34:29.990 --> 03:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
I'd have to look look back and see
 
03:34:32.450 --> 03:34:32.460 align:start position:0%
specifically higher dates we've hired
 
03:34:34.790 --> 03:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
now another safety inspector so where we
 
03:34:37.190 --> 03:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
had two we now have three full-time
 
03:34:39.889 --> 03:34:39.899 align:start position:0%
safety inspectors we still have the
 
03:34:41.210 --> 03:34:41.220 align:start position:0%
support staff
 
03:34:43.429 --> 03:34:43.439 align:start position:0%
and a portion of the director of
 
03:34:44.809 --> 03:34:44.819 align:start position:0%
inspections time
 
03:34:46.849 --> 03:34:46.859 align:start position:0%
I would point out that we're presently
 
03:34:48.769 --> 03:34:48.779 align:start position:0%
in the process regardless of what
 
03:34:50.809 --> 03:34:50.819 align:start position:0%
happens with this prospective
 
03:34:52.490 --> 03:34:52.500 align:start position:0%
legislation we are currently in the
 
03:34:55.070 --> 03:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
process of taking uh one of our
 
03:34:57.950 --> 03:34:57.960 align:start position:0%
positions and and turning that into a
 
03:35:01.370 --> 03:35:01.380 align:start position:0%
safety uh manager the safety manager
 
03:35:05.450 --> 03:35:05.460 align:start position:0%
position uh would manage directly the
 
03:35:07.790 --> 03:35:07.800 align:start position:0%
field inspectors and that administrative
 
03:35:10.429 --> 03:35:10.439 align:start position:0%
uh clerical support person and they
 
03:35:12.830 --> 03:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
would then report uh to the director of
 
03:35:14.269 --> 03:35:14.279 align:start position:0%
inspection and then up through the
 
03:35:16.210 --> 03:35:16.220 align:start position:0%
commissioner so in terms of just
 
03:35:18.769 --> 03:35:18.779 align:start position:0%
Staffing we're probably looking to at
 
03:35:21.170 --> 03:35:21.180 align:start position:0%
we've added one full-time safety
 
03:35:24.349 --> 03:35:24.359 align:start position:0%
inspector and we are looking to add one
 
03:35:26.090 --> 03:35:26.100 align:start position:0%
other position and when I say add
 
03:35:28.550 --> 03:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
specifically what we're doing is taking
 
03:35:30.830 --> 03:35:30.840 align:start position:0%
a current vacant position and
 
03:35:33.889 --> 03:35:33.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:37.849 --> 03:35:37.859 align:start position:0%
follow-up okay that's very helpful
 
03:35:41.269 --> 03:35:41.279 align:start position:0%
um along those same lines are there any
 
03:35:43.729 --> 03:35:43.739 align:start position:0%
entities because I know for sure that
 
03:35:46.010 --> 03:35:46.020 align:start position:0%
the private sector hires Consultants to
 
03:35:48.349 --> 03:35:48.359 align:start position:0%
help them and there's a lovely place
 
03:35:50.870 --> 03:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
here in in the north part of Concord
 
03:35:53.389 --> 03:35:53.399 align:start position:0%
that hosts groups on a number of levels
 
03:35:55.490 --> 03:35:55.500 align:start position:0%
about safety and that is I'm fairly
 
03:35:58.010 --> 03:35:58.020 align:start position:0%
certain not a state I think those are
 
03:35:59.570 --> 03:35:59.580 align:start position:0%
Consultants that work on that with
 
03:36:02.570 --> 03:36:02.580 align:start position:0%
industries that need it do you hire
 
03:36:05.870 --> 03:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
Consultants to help with any aspect of
 
03:36:09.309 --> 03:36:09.319 align:start position:0%
this from PR developing
 
03:36:12.229 --> 03:36:12.239 align:start position:0%
workplace safety Flyers like at any
 
03:36:14.090 --> 03:36:14.100 align:start position:0%
level do you
 
03:36:17.389 --> 03:36:17.399 align:start position:0%
um have any Consultants that assist with
 
03:36:19.429 --> 03:36:19.439 align:start position:0%
this sort of safety work for the
 
03:36:25.670 --> 03:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:33.410 --> 03:36:33.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:35.809 --> 03:36:35.819 align:start position:0%
I talked to you real quick earlier uh
 
03:36:38.690 --> 03:36:38.700 align:start position:0%
under the workers comp reform in 1993
 
03:36:41.330 --> 03:36:41.340 align:start position:0%
that was created a section of the law
 
03:36:43.849 --> 03:36:43.859 align:start position:0%
that um
 
03:36:46.490 --> 03:36:46.500 align:start position:0%
that created safety enhancement programs
 
03:36:48.590 --> 03:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
and you mentioned that you that you use
 
03:36:50.889 --> 03:36:50.899 align:start position:0%
this but it does seem to
 
03:36:54.769 --> 03:36:54.779 align:start position:0%
authorize the commissioner of of Labor
 
03:36:57.590 --> 03:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
to offer these programs safety
 
03:36:59.150 --> 03:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
enhancement programs and to hire
 
03:37:02.330 --> 03:37:02.340 align:start position:0%
Consultants to do some of this work it's
 
03:37:06.110 --> 03:37:06.120 align:start position:0%
specific to that it looks like and and
 
03:37:10.070 --> 03:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
Grant provide grants to uh as well so
 
03:37:11.630 --> 03:37:11.640 align:start position:0%
that that's been around for a long time
 
03:37:13.969 --> 03:37:13.979 align:start position:0%
and you might we mentioned you mentioned
 
03:37:16.490 --> 03:37:16.500 align:start position:0%
a little bit how you use that so yeah
 
03:37:18.530 --> 03:37:18.540 align:start position:0%
presently the and thank you for for
 
03:37:19.969 --> 03:37:19.979 align:start position:0%
showing that and speaking to me about it
 
03:37:22.070 --> 03:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
earlier there is within the workers comp
 
03:37:25.250 --> 03:37:25.260 align:start position:0%
section 281a a particular provision
 
03:37:27.170 --> 03:37:27.180 align:start position:0%
which speaks to the Department's uh
 
03:37:29.929 --> 03:37:29.939 align:start position:0%
safety training uh what that has been
 
03:37:33.410 --> 03:37:33.420 align:start position:0%
and uh utilized presently as is that our
 
03:37:35.510 --> 03:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
safety inspectors will as part of our
 
03:37:37.370 --> 03:37:37.380 align:start position:0%
training programs and Outreach that we
 
03:37:39.830 --> 03:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
do for employers a certain portion of
 
03:37:41.809 --> 03:37:41.819 align:start position:0%
those trainings are dedicated to a
 
03:37:44.330 --> 03:37:44.340 align:start position:0%
safety inspector providing an overview
 
03:37:47.110 --> 03:37:47.120 align:start position:0%
of an employer's requirements under 281
 
03:37:50.389 --> 03:37:50.399 align:start position:0%
a64. now those are certainly more narrow
 
03:37:52.550 --> 03:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
than what we're talking about uh today
 
03:37:55.849 --> 03:37:55.859 align:start position:0%
under 281 a64 we're talking about safety
 
03:37:58.070 --> 03:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
summary forms uh that's the requirement
 
03:38:00.590 --> 03:38:00.600 align:start position:0%
that employers of 15 or more individuals
 
03:38:02.510 --> 03:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
in the state provide a safety summary
 
03:38:04.809 --> 03:38:04.819 align:start position:0%
form detailing you know I have a program
 
03:38:07.370 --> 03:38:07.380 align:start position:0%
this is what my program entails
 
03:38:09.769 --> 03:38:09.779 align:start position:0%
additionally our safety inspectors at
 
03:38:10.910 --> 03:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
those uh
 
03:38:14.030 --> 03:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
seminars presently are speaking to Joint
 
03:38:15.769 --> 03:38:15.779 align:start position:0%
Loss Management committees again that's
 
03:38:18.950 --> 03:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
a requirement under 281 a64 that
 
03:38:21.410 --> 03:38:21.420 align:start position:0%
employers of 15 or more have an
 
03:38:22.969 --> 03:38:22.979 align:start position:0%
operating joint Loss Management
 
03:38:25.790 --> 03:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
committee which discusses safety issues
 
03:38:27.889 --> 03:38:27.899 align:start position:0%
and makes recommendations relative to
 
03:38:30.710 --> 03:38:30.720 align:start position:0%
safe operation of the employer in their
 
03:38:32.530 --> 03:38:32.540 align:start position:0%
utilization of employees so again
 
03:38:34.550 --> 03:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie understand your
 
03:38:36.710 --> 03:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
point was is that perhaps that could be
 
03:38:38.830 --> 03:38:38.840 align:start position:0%
looked at with a broader view
 
03:38:41.269 --> 03:38:41.279 align:start position:0%
presently what that's being utilized or
 
03:38:44.210 --> 03:38:44.220 align:start position:0%
looked at for is under 281 a64 the
 
03:38:45.769 --> 03:38:45.779 align:start position:0%
safety summary form and Joint Loss
 
03:38:46.849 --> 03:38:46.859 align:start position:0%
Management program but it's something
 
03:38:49.790 --> 03:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
that we can look at it would be helpful
 
03:38:52.309 --> 03:38:52.319 align:start position:0%
if you could take a look and see if that
 
03:38:54.889 --> 03:38:54.899 align:start position:0%
statute does apply to what
 
03:38:56.990 --> 03:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
what we may want to do here in
 
03:39:00.349 --> 03:39:00.359 align:start position:0%
transitioning from DOL standards to OSHA
 
03:39:03.610 --> 03:39:03.620 align:start position:0%
standards um if it if it doesn't apply
 
03:39:06.290 --> 03:39:06.300 align:start position:0%
we might want to come up with some
 
03:39:08.570 --> 03:39:08.580 align:start position:0%
mirror language to attach to this bill
 
03:39:10.130 --> 03:39:10.140 align:start position:0%
so that
 
03:39:13.389 --> 03:39:13.399 align:start position:0%
um we can have the uh
 
03:39:16.010 --> 03:39:16.020 align:start position:0%
the directive to the Department of Labor
 
03:39:20.570 --> 03:39:20.580 align:start position:0%
and an appropriation if needed to um
 
03:39:22.790 --> 03:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
to make that happen for the various uh
 
03:39:25.910 --> 03:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
public sector uh Employers in and to be
 
03:39:28.190 --> 03:39:28.200 align:start position:0%
clear on that provision right now there
 
03:39:30.889 --> 03:39:30.899 align:start position:0%
are no grants or no Appropriations or
 
03:39:33.889 --> 03:39:33.899 align:start position:0%
anything like that it literally is a
 
03:39:36.710 --> 03:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
training uh where our safety inspectors
 
03:39:38.570 --> 03:39:38.580 align:start position:0%
will provide that training so there's
 
03:39:41.690 --> 03:39:41.700 align:start position:0%
presently no appropriation or grants
 
03:39:44.690 --> 03:39:44.700 align:start position:0%
offered or anything of that nature so
 
03:39:45.889 --> 03:39:45.899 align:start position:0%
probably we would need to create
 
03:39:48.410 --> 03:39:48.420 align:start position:0%
something similar but uh applied
 
03:39:51.469 --> 03:39:51.479 align:start position:0%
specifically to the um the safety
 
03:39:54.530 --> 03:39:54.540 align:start position:0%
standards correct
 
03:39:56.269 --> 03:39:56.279 align:start position:0%
depending upon what you wanted to do
 
03:39:57.349 --> 03:39:57.359 align:start position:0%
with it
 
03:40:00.290 --> 03:40:00.300 align:start position:0%
but that that statute doesn't do it no
 
03:40:00.300 --> 03:40:01.910 align:start position:0%
but that that statute doesn't do it no
okay

03:40:01.910 --> 03:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:40:04.610 --> 03:40:04.620 align:start position:0%
very good
 
03:40:06.050 --> 03:40:06.060 align:start position:0%
anything else for the Deputy
 
03:40:06.060 --> 03:40:09.170 align:start position:0%
anything else for the Deputy
Commissioner

03:40:09.170 --> 03:40:09.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:13.190 --> 03:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:15.530 --> 03:40:15.540 align:start position:0%
commissioner erlinghaus uh do you have
 
03:40:16.790 --> 03:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
some thoughts you might want to share
 
03:40:18.769 --> 03:40:18.779 align:start position:0%
with the
 
03:40:18.779 --> 03:40:22.550 align:start position:0%
with the
committee

03:40:22.550 --> 03:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:24.530 --> 03:40:24.540 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't really
 
03:40:26.150 --> 03:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
um I'm here and and I think somebody
 
03:40:27.710 --> 03:40:27.720 align:start position:0%
probably told you that you know Joyce
 
03:40:29.150 --> 03:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
Pittman would be here but she had a
 
03:40:32.030 --> 03:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
scheduled long scheduled day off and the
 
03:40:34.370 --> 03:40:34.380 align:start position:0%
last thing I do is ask valued employees
 
03:40:36.889 --> 03:40:36.899 align:start position:0%
to cancel vacations it is summertime yes
 
03:40:36.899 --> 03:40:38.510 align:start position:0%
to cancel vacations it is summertime yes
exactly

03:40:38.510 --> 03:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
03:40:40.490 --> 03:40:40.500 align:start position:0%
um no I think you talked to Rudy and
 
03:40:42.349 --> 03:40:42.359 align:start position:0%
Rudy's the expert and uh you know our
 
03:40:44.570 --> 03:40:44.580 align:start position:0%
department is obviously able to
 
03:40:47.210 --> 03:40:47.220 align:start position:0%
um from a state perspective help
 
03:40:49.849 --> 03:40:49.859 align:start position:0%
Implement whatever policy decisions the
 
03:40:51.950 --> 03:40:51.960 align:start position:0%
committee makes and all of that and I
 
03:40:54.469 --> 03:40:54.479 align:start position:0%
think we recognize that uh Department of
 
03:40:57.229 --> 03:40:57.239 align:start position:0%
administrative services will have uh
 
03:40:59.929 --> 03:40:59.939 align:start position:0%
um a lot of ground to cover with regard
 
03:41:01.790 --> 03:41:01.800 align:start position:0%
to all of the agencies and departments
 
03:41:05.269 --> 03:41:05.279 align:start position:0%
so um we want to make sure that we're
 
03:41:08.090 --> 03:41:08.100 align:start position:0%
setting you up for success I think to
 
03:41:09.650 --> 03:41:09.660 align:start position:0%
the extent to you know depending a lot
 
03:41:11.690 --> 03:41:11.700 align:start position:0%
on what you end up deciding to do I you
 
03:41:13.910 --> 03:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
know we've talked in the past about
 
03:41:15.410 --> 03:41:15.420 align:start position:0%
um there's a significant
 
03:41:15.420 --> 03:41:16.269 align:start position:0%
um there's a significant
um

03:41:16.269 --> 03:41:16.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:18.889 --> 03:41:18.899 align:start position:0%
there's a cost to it in doing the
 
03:41:20.389 --> 03:41:20.399 align:start position:0%
evaluation of you know where the state
 
03:41:22.130 --> 03:41:22.140 align:start position:0%
is what changes have to be made and all
 
03:41:24.110 --> 03:41:24.120 align:start position:0%
of that so if you start looking at an
 
03:41:25.849 --> 03:41:25.859 align:start position:0%
appropriation I would encourage you to
 
03:41:28.490 --> 03:41:28.500 align:start position:0%
to take that into consideration it's not
 
03:41:29.990 --> 03:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
you know a significant transition
 
03:41:32.330 --> 03:41:32.340 align:start position:0%
depending on what you're doing is not
 
03:41:33.710 --> 03:41:33.720 align:start position:0%
something that couldn't be done with
 
03:41:36.530 --> 03:41:36.540 align:start position:0%
existing staff right
 
03:41:39.670 --> 03:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
go ahead hi commissioner
 
03:41:42.950 --> 03:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
this may be relevant or it may not
 
03:41:44.929 --> 03:41:44.939 align:start position:0%
um my spouse worked at admin Services
 
03:41:47.630 --> 03:41:47.640 align:start position:0%
before your tenure so I know some from
 
03:41:50.090 --> 03:41:50.100 align:start position:0%
his point of view as it's been shared I
 
03:41:52.790 --> 03:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
know that there are existing
 
03:41:54.950 --> 03:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
um things that already address safety
 
03:41:57.050 --> 03:41:57.060 align:start position:0%
just because it's the smart thing to do
 
03:41:59.750 --> 03:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
from ergonomic training I don't know
 
03:42:02.030 --> 03:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
what department that comes out of
 
03:42:05.330 --> 03:42:05.340 align:start position:0%
um maybe eight the HR I forget what you
 
03:42:09.590 --> 03:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
call HR in your admin services but uh
 
03:42:12.050 --> 03:42:12.060 align:start position:0%
two of course if there is a state-run
 
03:42:14.450 --> 03:42:14.460 align:start position:0%
facility that needs the Safe Serve
 
03:42:17.809 --> 03:42:17.819 align:start position:0%
training for Food Service workers
 
03:42:19.309 --> 03:42:19.319 align:start position:0%
because you have some food service
 
03:42:22.849 --> 03:42:22.859 align:start position:0%
workers so there there must be already
 
03:42:26.750 --> 03:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
just for basic common sense like don't
 
03:42:29.389 --> 03:42:29.399 align:start position:0%
mix bleach with ammonia like there must
 
03:42:32.150 --> 03:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
be some sort of thing already happening
 
03:42:34.010 --> 03:42:34.020 align:start position:0%
to some degree
 
03:42:35.690 --> 03:42:35.700 align:start position:0%
um because let's face it not everybody
 
03:42:38.090 --> 03:42:38.100 align:start position:0%
does have common sense about these
 
03:42:40.790 --> 03:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
things so I'm wondering do you know
 
03:42:43.490 --> 03:42:43.500 align:start position:0%
either through Consultants or employees
 
03:42:46.429 --> 03:42:46.439 align:start position:0%
that you or others may direct who
 
03:42:49.969 --> 03:42:49.979 align:start position:0%
implements those things now
 
03:42:51.830 --> 03:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
um it it's a good it's a good question I
 
03:42:54.229 --> 03:42:54.239 align:start position:0%
think did your spouse work in fdm do I
 
03:42:56.750 --> 03:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
remember that yes okay
 
03:42:58.910 --> 03:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
I I try to Lodge a piece of information
 
03:43:01.729 --> 03:43:01.739 align:start position:0%
in my brain every now and again
 
03:43:04.790 --> 03:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
um the uh so we obviously
 
03:43:08.090 --> 03:43:08.100 align:start position:0%
um occupational safety is is a is is a
 
03:43:10.610 --> 03:43:10.620 align:start position:0%
concern of ours every day right and and
 
03:43:12.229 --> 03:43:12.239 align:start position:0%
it takes different forms in different
 
03:43:14.630 --> 03:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
places obviously uh computer workers
 
03:43:16.490 --> 03:43:16.500 align:start position:0%
have have different uh things they look
 
03:43:18.889 --> 03:43:18.899 align:start position:0%
at a lot of it involves we do regular
 
03:43:21.050 --> 03:43:21.060 align:start position:0%
chair inspections for example
 
03:43:22.849 --> 03:43:22.859 align:start position:0%
um and things like that whereas on our
 
03:43:24.889 --> 03:43:24.899 align:start position:0%
point and property section where we have
 
03:43:26.510 --> 03:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
you know hundreds of employees who are
 
03:43:30.110 --> 03:43:30.120 align:start position:0%
doing uh uh doing more uh traditional
 
03:43:32.870 --> 03:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
physical labor we have significant we do
 
03:43:34.610 --> 03:43:34.620 align:start position:0%
trainings and and things like that all
 
03:43:35.809 --> 03:43:35.819 align:start position:0%
the time
 
03:43:39.410 --> 03:43:39.420 align:start position:0%
um in the budget we we uh transformed a
 
03:43:41.570 --> 03:43:41.580 align:start position:0%
position into uh into a health and
 
03:43:43.490 --> 03:43:43.500 align:start position:0%
safety officer so things like that do
 
03:43:45.110 --> 03:43:45.120 align:start position:0%
happen and frankly in every Department
 
03:43:47.090 --> 03:43:47.100 align:start position:0%
if you think about it I'm sure the you
 
03:43:48.469 --> 03:43:48.479 align:start position:0%
know transportation for example probably
 
03:43:51.229 --> 03:43:51.239 align:start position:0%
has a fairly robust program so a lot of
 
03:43:53.990 --> 03:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of those things are happening
 
03:43:57.010 --> 03:43:57.020 align:start position:0%
um they tend to be geared
 
03:43:59.330 --> 03:43:59.340 align:start position:0%
along the lines of what do you do every
 
03:44:00.590 --> 03:44:00.600 align:start position:0%
day and how do we make sure you don't
 
03:44:02.570 --> 03:44:02.580 align:start position:0%
get back injuries for example
 
03:44:04.190 --> 03:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
um you know we have uh workers comp
 
03:44:06.229 --> 03:44:06.239 align:start position:0%
Consultants who work with
 
03:44:07.490 --> 03:44:07.500 align:start position:0%
um you know from our insurance carrier
 
03:44:09.650 --> 03:44:09.660 align:start position:0%
who work uh periodically with agencies
 
03:44:12.710 --> 03:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
on you know these things as simple as
 
03:44:15.889 --> 03:44:15.899 align:start position:0%
the proper way to lift a box to not get
 
03:44:17.990 --> 03:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
back injuries they tend to work less
 
03:44:20.269 --> 03:44:20.279 align:start position:0%
with me because I I lift fewer boxes
 
03:44:23.870 --> 03:44:23.880 align:start position:0%
than average at least not heavy ones
 
03:44:24.950 --> 03:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
um but
 
03:44:26.929 --> 03:44:26.939 align:start position:0%
um so a lot of that is going on I don't
 
03:44:28.309 --> 03:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
know that for the most part those things
 
03:44:31.490 --> 03:44:31.500 align:start position:0%
would be repurposed because none of what
 
03:44:33.950 --> 03:44:33.960 align:start position:0%
well none of none of what any of those
 
03:44:35.630 --> 03:44:35.640 align:start position:0%
people are doing would we stop doing
 
03:44:37.670 --> 03:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
right I mean we're still going to be
 
03:44:39.590 --> 03:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
doing all of that kind of stuff but but
 
03:44:41.510 --> 03:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
no there's a there's a lot that does go
 
03:44:41.520 --> 03:44:44.750 align:start position:0%
no there's a there's a lot that does go
on

03:44:44.750 --> 03:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:46.550 --> 03:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner
 
03:44:49.690 --> 03:44:49.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:52.550 --> 03:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
seeing how we have uh
 
03:44:54.410 --> 03:44:54.420 align:start position:0%
no one else who wants to speak to the
 
03:44:54.420 --> 03:44:56.110 align:start position:0%
no one else who wants to speak to the
committee

03:44:56.110 --> 03:44:56.120 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:45:00.710 --> 03:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
my thinking is that uh rep Cole come and
 
03:45:01.990 --> 03:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
I guess
 
03:45:07.849 --> 03:45:07.859 align:start position:0%
avelini and infantine will have to
 
03:45:09.650 --> 03:45:09.660 align:start position:0%
do some scheduling and I hate to do
 
03:45:11.870 --> 03:45:11.880 align:start position:0%
scheduling with two important people not
 
03:45:13.250 --> 03:45:13.260 align:start position:0%
in the room
 
03:45:15.710 --> 03:45:15.720 align:start position:0%
um but um
 
03:45:17.630 --> 03:45:17.640 align:start position:0%
after next week we're pretty much shut
 
03:45:20.330 --> 03:45:20.340 align:start position:0%
down for July and August I would
 
03:45:23.510 --> 03:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
anticipate getting back to to this in
 
03:45:26.330 --> 03:45:26.340 align:start position:0%
September and scheduling a series of
 
03:45:28.790 --> 03:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
meetings and inviting
 
03:45:31.790 --> 03:45:31.800 align:start position:0%
um some of these interest groups in not
 
03:45:34.570 --> 03:45:34.580 align:start position:0%
only the employers but the employee
 
03:45:37.610 --> 03:45:37.620 align:start position:0%
Representatives that
 
03:45:41.590 --> 03:45:41.600 align:start position:0%
match up with them so that we can get a
 
03:45:45.110 --> 03:45:45.120 align:start position:0%
a clear picture of what they feel they
 
03:45:47.450 --> 03:45:47.460 align:start position:0%
need in order to make this uh this
 
03:45:49.729 --> 03:45:49.739 align:start position:0%
program work for for them
 
03:45:49.739 --> 03:45:50.990 align:start position:0%
program work for for them
um

03:45:50.990 --> 03:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:45:54.229 --> 03:45:54.239 align:start position:0%
can I get a feel from reps Mackenzie
 
03:45:56.990 --> 03:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
Susie and colcum as to what kind of
 
03:46:00.469 --> 03:46:00.479 align:start position:0%
schedule you would want to uh set for um
 
03:46:13.610 --> 03:46:13.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:15.349 --> 03:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking in terms of weekly
 
03:46:15.359 --> 03:46:16.969 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking in terms of weekly
bi-weekly

03:46:16.969 --> 03:46:16.979 align:start position:0%
bi-weekly
 
03:46:19.250 --> 03:46:19.260 align:start position:0%
um you know do you want to hit it
 
03:46:20.870 --> 03:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
aggressively and get it over with or do
 
03:46:22.370 --> 03:46:22.380 align:start position:0%
you want to spread it out over September
 
03:46:27.650 --> 03:46:27.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:33.590 --> 03:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:36.229 --> 03:46:36.239 align:start position:0%
are you allowed to have those over Zoom
 
03:46:36.239 --> 03:46:38.150 align:start position:0%
are you allowed to have those over Zoom
no

03:46:38.150 --> 03:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
no
 
03:46:41.150 --> 03:46:41.160 align:start position:0%
I am out of town until September 7th
 
03:46:44.150 --> 03:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
after that I can be flexible with my
 
03:46:44.160 --> 03:46:45.550 align:start position:0%
after that I can be flexible with my
schedule

03:46:45.550 --> 03:46:45.560 align:start position:0%
schedule
 
03:46:48.769 --> 03:46:48.779 align:start position:0%
will be hard but
 
03:46:50.870 --> 03:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
other days we can certainly avoid
 
03:46:52.010 --> 03:46:52.020 align:start position:0%
Mondays then
 
03:46:55.429 --> 03:46:55.439 align:start position:0%
um the what I will plan to do is touch
 
03:46:59.410 --> 03:46:59.420 align:start position:0%
base with um representatives evolini and
 
03:47:02.210 --> 03:47:02.220 align:start position:0%
infantine next week we're obviously all
 
03:47:04.190 --> 03:47:04.200 align:start position:0%
in on Thursday
 
03:47:05.690 --> 03:47:05.700 align:start position:0%
um and um
 
03:47:08.330 --> 03:47:08.340 align:start position:0%
find out what will work best and start
 
03:47:10.490 --> 03:47:10.500 align:start position:0%
getting some emails to you folks to let
 
03:47:12.110 --> 03:47:12.120 align:start position:0%
you know what the schedule is and then
 
03:47:14.150 --> 03:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
get getting some invites out to these
 
03:47:17.090 --> 03:47:17.100 align:start position:0%
various interest groups who may want to
 
03:47:18.130 --> 03:47:18.140 align:start position:0%
come in and
 
03:47:20.990 --> 03:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
get the information and
 
03:47:21.000 --> 03:47:22.370 align:start position:0%
get the information and
um

03:47:22.370 --> 03:47:22.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:25.630 --> 03:47:25.640 align:start position:0%
uh Deputy Commissioner perhaps
 
03:47:28.309 --> 03:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
I can get a list together of people that
 
03:47:31.790 --> 03:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
you can send the 1910 comparison uh file
 
03:47:34.490 --> 03:47:34.500 align:start position:0%
to so that when people arrive they're
 
03:47:36.110 --> 03:47:36.120 align:start position:0%
not uh
 
03:47:38.090 --> 03:47:38.100 align:start position:0%
um I mean if if we tell them about it
 
03:47:40.429 --> 03:47:40.439 align:start position:0%
when they get here they haven't had a
 
03:47:41.750 --> 03:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
chance to do much of anything with it
 
03:47:43.870 --> 03:47:43.880 align:start position:0%
and I think
 
03:47:47.929 --> 03:47:47.939 align:start position:0%
Mr Ross has experience that it's a a bit
 
03:47:50.090 --> 03:47:50.100 align:start position:0%
of an undertaking
 
03:47:52.130 --> 03:47:52.140 align:start position:0%
um so it's uh something you'd want to
 
03:47:54.170 --> 03:47:54.180 align:start position:0%
have well in advance I I was frankly
 
03:47:56.750 --> 03:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
quite surprised when I first opened it
 
03:47:58.729 --> 03:47:58.739 align:start position:0%
um and and somewhat baffled because we
 
03:48:02.090 --> 03:48:02.100 align:start position:0%
we had three files and you know two of
 
03:48:03.889 --> 03:48:03.899 align:start position:0%
them were very similar and it just uh
 
03:48:06.710 --> 03:48:06.720 align:start position:0%
you know but boiling it down to just
 
03:48:08.570 --> 03:48:08.580 align:start position:0%
1910 I think will help and I think some
 
03:48:10.010 --> 03:48:10.020 align:start position:0%
of these groups will be able to look at
 
03:48:11.510 --> 03:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
it and say this doesn't apply to me I'm
 
03:48:13.370 --> 03:48:13.380 align:start position:0%
not even going to open it
 
03:48:15.830 --> 03:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
um so I did I think a lot of the groups
 
03:48:18.110 --> 03:48:18.120 align:start position:0%
can simply pick and choose those areas
 
03:48:20.870 --> 03:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
that are relevant to their area of work
 
03:48:23.210 --> 03:48:23.220 align:start position:0%
if you're in a nursing home you don't
 
03:48:25.610 --> 03:48:25.620 align:start position:0%
have to do the heavy equipment section
 
03:48:27.670 --> 03:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
um well maybe you do a little bit
 
03:48:32.210 --> 03:48:32.220 align:start position:0%
what do I know so
 
03:48:34.309 --> 03:48:34.319 align:start position:0%
so anyways um unless there's something
 
03:48:37.550 --> 03:48:37.560 align:start position:0%
else that we need to discuss
 
03:48:37.560 --> 03:48:40.729 align:start position:0%
else that we need to discuss
um

03:48:40.729 --> 03:48:40.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:42.349 --> 03:48:42.359 align:start position:0%
McKenzie's gone
 
03:48:45.290 --> 03:48:45.300 align:start position:0%
um okay well we will um bring this to a
