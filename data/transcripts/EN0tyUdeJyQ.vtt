00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:03.560 align:start position:0%
the house Judiciary Committee to
 
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:06.520 align:start position:0%
order this morning we are hearing two
 
00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 align:start position:0%
bills House Bill 622 and
 
00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:12.320 align:start position:0%
625 uh
 
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:14.200 align:start position:0%
contemporaneously and my plan this
 
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
morning is to call upon the sponsors of
 
00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 align:start position:0%
those bills toh speak first and then I
 
00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:24.279 align:start position:0%
will call upon those people who wish to
 
00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 align:start position:0%
testify we do have a relatively long
 
00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 align:start position:0%
witness uh list today number of people
 
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 align:start position:0%
who do want to speak in either support
 
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.830 align:start position:0%
who do want to speak in either support
or

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
opposition what my intention is is once
 
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 align:start position:0%
we give the sponsors an opportunity to
 
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 align:start position:0%
introduce their bills is to uh allow
 
00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 align:start position:0%
people to speak but hold them to a three
 
00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 align:start position:0%
minute time limit on their speech and
 
00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 align:start position:0%
we'll be timing that to make sure that
 
00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 align:start position:0%
they stay within the designated time
 
00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 align:start position:0%
frame that will allow us to hear from
 
00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:01.719 align:start position:0%
everyone today today if we didn't impose
 
00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 align:start position:0%
that limit I'm not sure we'd be able to
 
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 align:start position:0%
finish our hearing today there is a lot
 
00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 align:start position:0%

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 align:start position:0%

622
 
00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:32.680 align:start position:0%
protecting na human life as a reasonable
 
00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:35.240 align:start position:0%
and valid State
 
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
interest this bill steps away from
 
00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:41.800 align:start position:0%
religious emotional and political
 
00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
considerations and instead focuses on
 
00:10:47.389 --> 00:10:47.399 align:start position:0%
the particulars of the Supreme Court
 
00:10:49.949 --> 00:10:49.959 align:start position:0%
decision in Planned Parenthood versus
 
00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:52.680 align:start position:0%
Casey of
 
00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
1992 which superseded or overturned some
 
00:11:00.829 --> 00:11:00.839 align:start position:0%
of the significant portions of Ro v Wade
 
00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
the first trimester
 
00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
standard and do versus Bol
 
00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:09.560 align:start position:0%
Bolton uh the abortion post
 
00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:13.000 align:start position:0%
viability both of
 
00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:16.680 align:start position:0%
1973 for a viability principle relative
 
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
to gestational development when an
 
00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
abortion may be
 
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
permitted given that this matter of
 
00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
abortion is a highly charged and
 
00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:29.560 align:start position:0%
divisive issue in our culture today
 
00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:31.880 align:start position:0%
my bill is an attempt to utilize the
 
00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court decision in
 
00:11:37.829 --> 00:11:37.839 align:start position:0%
Casey to establish some common ground of
 
00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:40.720 align:start position:0%
acceptability on both sides of the
 
00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:44.680 align:start position:0%
issue and thereby restore some respect
 
00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
we should have to the intrinsic value of
 
00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
human life from early stages prior to
 
00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
birth and acknowledge the state's
 
00:11:58.470 --> 00:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
interest in protecting early life
 
00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:00.360 align:start position:0%
enabling birth and growth into
 
00:12:03.949 --> 00:12:03.959 align:start position:0%
productive citizenry endowed with those
 
00:12:07.629 --> 00:12:07.639 align:start position:0%
other rights of Liberty property and
 
00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
pursuit of happiness that we all enjoy
 
00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
Arisen from the privilege of
 
00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
Birthright the intent is to reduce if
 
00:12:20.189 --> 00:12:20.199 align:start position:0%
not yet completely eliminate the
 
00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:23.480 align:start position:0%
dichotomy we've had for the last 48
 
00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
years between the right to life of the
 
00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:29.800 align:start position:0%
pre-born and the lawful consent granted
 
00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:33.160 align:start position:0%
for abortion under the
 
00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
law just as Fair
 
00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
disclosure I am a practicing catholic
 
00:12:41.509 --> 00:12:41.519 align:start position:0%
christian who holds to the belief that
 
00:12:43.949 --> 00:12:43.959 align:start position:0%
teaching and teachings that all human
 
00:12:47.949 --> 00:12:47.959 align:start position:0%
life is sacred and in violate from the
 
00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:50.440 align:start position:0%
moment of conception to the moment of
 
00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:51.949 align:start position:0%
moment of conception to the moment of
natural

00:12:51.949 --> 00:12:51.959 align:start position:0%
natural
 
00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:55.480 align:start position:0%
death but this bill is separately
 
00:12:59.189 --> 00:12:59.199 align:start position:0%
focused on the law as it stands today
 
00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:03.240 align:start position:0%
without any reflection on its moral
 
00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:05.800 align:start position:0%
validity the court wrestled with the
 
00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:07.880 align:start position:0%
point at which abortion should be
 
00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:11.480 align:start position:0%
acceptable or not and split in their
 
00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:14.240 align:start position:0%
views on each of the five elements
 
00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:17.720 align:start position:0%
challenged in the Pennsylvania law with
 
00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:19.720 align:start position:0%
the Casey
 
00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:22.240 align:start position:0%
case it was thought at the time that
 
00:13:24.389 --> 00:13:24.399 align:start position:0%
Casey Would overturn
 
00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:28.240 align:start position:0%
R but when they got right down to it
 
00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
just as sudor and Kennedy flip-flo to
 
00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
make a 5 to4
 
00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
plurality and out of it all came three
 
00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:38.509 align:start position:0%
plurality and out of it all came three
essential

00:13:38.509 --> 00:13:38.519 align:start position:0%
essential
 
00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
Holdings one women have the right to
 
00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
have an abortion prior to
 
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
viability without undue burden from the
 
00:13:51.949 --> 00:13:51.959 align:start position:0%
state two the state can restrict
 
00:13:55.389 --> 00:13:55.399 align:start position:0%
abortion post viability if there are
 
00:13:57.749 --> 00:13:57.759 align:start position:0%
bypass for life and
 
00:13:57.759 --> 00:13:59.350 align:start position:0%
bypass for life and
health

00:13:59.350 --> 00:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
health
 
00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
and three the state has a legitimate
 
00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
interest from the outset of
 
00:14:07.629 --> 00:14:07.639 align:start position:0%
pregnancy in protecting the health of
 
00:14:12.749 --> 00:14:12.759 align:start position:0%
the woman and the life of the pre-born
 
00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
child so why does the state have an
 
00:14:18.949 --> 00:14:18.959 align:start position:0%
interest in this human life our
 
00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:22.120 align:start position:0%
population growth has stalled and if it
 
00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
weren't for immigration it would be in
 
00:14:28.069 --> 00:14:28.079 align:start position:0%
Decline we're having trouble filling
 
00:14:31.189 --> 00:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
jobs even before covid with Help Wanted
 
00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:32.920 align:start position:0%
signs all over the
 
00:14:35.629 --> 00:14:35.639 align:start position:0%
place and business owners complaining
 
00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
about the quantity and even the quality
 
00:14:39.509 --> 00:14:39.519 align:start position:0%
of the labor
 
00:14:42.749 --> 00:14:42.759 align:start position:0%
pool and Social Security is forecast to
 
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
go bankrupt in what TW in what maybe
 
00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
2034 or so
 
00:14:51.269 --> 00:14:51.279 align:start position:0%
due to everl lasening contri
 
00:14:53.749 --> 00:14:53.759 align:start position:0%
contributors and an increase in benefit
 
00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
numbers and
 
00:14:59.590 --> 00:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
amounts it should be no mystery why that
 
00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:02.680 align:start position:0%
is contraception has been in full swing
 
00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:03.550 align:start position:0%
is contraception has been in full swing
for

00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:03.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
decades and by the collective estimates
 
00:15:07.509 --> 00:15:07.519 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
CDC gut marker Institute and other
 
00:15:13.629 --> 00:15:13.639 align:start position:0%
organizations that keep the
 
00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:19.160 align:start position:0%
count America has aborted 62 million
 
00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:26.829 --> 00:15:26.839 align:start position:0%
1973 we are now a population of 325
 
00:15:29.389 --> 00:15:29.399 align:start position:0%
million people in America
 
00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:34.720 align:start position:0%
so what we would have been without that
 
00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
elimination maybe 400
 
00:15:40.829 --> 00:15:40.839 align:start position:0%
million our national fertility rate by
 
00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
rough measure under the total fertility
 
00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
rate with the

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
1.73 and that's a 2018 figure children
 
00:15:59.389 --> 00:15:59.399 align:start position:0%
per lifetime of a childbearing woman
 
00:16:03.189 --> 00:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
in 1980 it was
 
00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
1.84 replacement rate would be
 
00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:12.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:15.629 --> 00:16:15.639 align:start position:0%
study viability is
 
00:16:18.309 --> 00:16:18.319 align:start position:0%
imprecise and while it only references
 
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
to the possible range of 22 to 28
 
00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
weeks it respects and relies upon the
 
00:16:28.189 --> 00:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
expertise and ethics of medical

Trifecta however this bill will not
 
00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
bring us into line with other Republican
 
00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
Trifecta States what this will do is
 
00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:35.960 align:start position:0%
bring us in line with other Democrat
 
00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:40.760 align:start position:0%
Trifecta States uh such as Minnesota um

abortion friendly states in the nation

procedure called intact dilation and
 
00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
extraction of a viable fetus um in such
 
00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
a procedure and I'm going to quote from
 
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.669 align:start position:0%
a procedure and I'm going to quote from
RSA

00:20:21.669 --> 00:20:21.679 align:start position:0%

unquote in other words the only
 
00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:46.120 align:start position:0%
abortions that this general court has
 
00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:49.240 align:start position:0%
seen fit to prohibit are those in which
 
00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:53.000 align:start position:0%
the abortion provider is preed prepared
 
00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
to pierce the skull of a recognized
 
00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:56.750 align:start position:0%
to pierce the skull of a recognized
human

00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
human
 
00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
infant Pro prohibitions on abortions at
 
00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
or after 24 weeks should be a bipartisan
 
00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
measure roie Wade um the gold standard
 
00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
for the pro-choice movement addresses
 
00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:16.120 align:start position:0%
this particular um issue in roie way the
 
00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:20.360 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court explicitly rejected I want
 
00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
to make sure you hear the word rejected
 
00:21:24.669 --> 00:21:24.679 align:start position:0%
the view that and I'm going to quote
 
00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
again entitled to terminate her
 
00:21:29.669 --> 00:21:29.679 align:start position:0%
pregnancy at whatever time in whatever
 
00:21:33.549 --> 00:21:33.559 align:start position:0%
way and for whatever reason she alone
 
00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
chooses and that's the end of the quote
 
00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:40.559 align:start position:0%
I recognize oh so much I recognize that
 
00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:43.480 align:start position:0%
is in this polarized political climate
 
00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
the extreme view that Ro the Wade uh
 
00:21:50.669 --> 00:21:50.679 align:start position:0%
rejected has ironically become kind of
 
00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
the religious Creed for the pro-choice
 
00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
movement and for many Democrats in
 
00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
elected office the unfortunate fact that
 
00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
if I had even introduced a 37-week ban I
 
00:22:07.789 --> 00:22:07.799 align:start position:0%
would be surprised I would be pleasantly
 
00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:10.360 align:start position:0%
surprised but I would be persu P
 
00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
surprised if I persuaded a single
 
00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
Democrat to support it yet um I do call
 
00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:21.320 align:start position:0%
on the support of pro-life Republicans
 
00:22:23.909 --> 00:22:23.919 align:start position:0%
moderate Republicans and those
 
00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:27.200 align:start position:0%
Libertarians who recognize that a fetus
 
00:22:30.789 --> 00:22:30.799 align:start position:0%
acquires rights at some point in its
 
00:22:34.669 --> 00:22:34.679 align:start position:0%
development prior to birth after all
 
00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:37.720 align:start position:0%
this bill is nothing more than the kind
 
00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
of restriction contemplated as
 
00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
permissible in row itself and I'd be
 
00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:46.520 align:start position:0%
glad to take questions I just want to
 
00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:48.480 align:start position:0%

states such as uh Minnesota and Maine
 
00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:23.600 align:start position:0%

losier Institute but other than that I
 
00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:18.960 align:start position:0%

today representative Horgan um yes just
 
00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:29.360 align:start position:0%

Republican Trifecta what exactly are the
 
00:24:35.909 --> 00:24:35.919 align:start position:0%
three legs of that Trifecta okay sorry
 
00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
um it's the the fact that the
 
00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
Republicans currently hold the Senate
 
00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:45.240 align:start position:0%
the house and the governor's seat um and

some views about um HB

622 um I would like to keep this brief
 
00:28:04.269 --> 00:28:04.279 align:start position:0%
for your time I do work as a physician
 
00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:06.640 align:start position:0%
in OBGYN working alongside amazing
 
00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:09.320 align:start position:0%
colleagues who are equally upset and
 
00:28:12.029 --> 00:28:12.039 align:start position:0%
worried about the implic 622 on our
 
00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:14.360 align:start position:0%
patients um we would like to start with
 
00:28:16.909 --> 00:28:16.919 align:start position:0%
just the facts especially since HB 622
 
00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:18.200 align:start position:0%
talks about protecting the life of the
 
00:28:20.389 --> 00:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
mother and the life of The Unborn as uh
 
00:28:22.149 --> 00:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
one of the representatives kindly shared
 
00:28:25.149 --> 00:28:25.159 align:start position:0%
to develop a Workforce of productive and
 
00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:28.200 align:start position:0%
to um uh
 
00:28:29.549 --> 00:28:29.559 align:start position:0%
increased quality of life in New
 
00:28:31.789 --> 00:28:31.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire when people have an abortion
 
00:28:33.669 --> 00:28:33.679 align:start position:0%
at later terms it's not for reasons that
 
00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:36.200 align:start position:0%
they choose many times it's for women
 
00:28:37.669 --> 00:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
who have experienced some of the worst
 
00:28:39.909 --> 00:28:39.919 align:start position:0%
news of their life and finding out that
 
00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:41.480 align:start position:0%
their baby has a fetal anomaly or
 
00:28:43.029 --> 00:28:43.039 align:start position:0%
complications that threaten their life
 
00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:45.720 align:start position:0%
or their um life as a mother these are
 
00:28:48.509 --> 00:28:48.519 align:start position:0%
women and partners who have created
 
00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:52.360 align:start position:0%
homes and cribs and dreams and um have
 
00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
imagined a future for their child these
 
00:28:58.190 --> 00:28:58.200 align:start position:0%
are not people who um have not not seen
 
00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
themselves as parents already sometimes
 
00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
abortions occur because these F
 
00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:03.880 align:start position:0%
anomalies are incompatible with life as
 
00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:05.720 align:start position:0%
in they are not going to be able to live
 
00:29:07.549 --> 00:29:07.559 align:start position:0%
outside of the womb as in they cannot be
 
00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
prisons for our society they will not be
 
00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
able to survive and for that reason we
 
00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:17.960 align:start position:0%
offer this as a way the the uh mother to
 
00:29:19.789 --> 00:29:19.799 align:start position:0%
make a choice that probably rips her
 
00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
heart open to have to under that late
 
00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:25.960 align:start position:0%
term um the testing that you know
 
00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
another bill that's coming up talks
 
00:29:28.789 --> 00:29:28.799 align:start position:0%
about you know whether or not patients
 
00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
are adequately informed is insulting in
 
00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
many ways because the way in which we
 
00:29:34.509 --> 00:29:34.519 align:start position:0%
talk to our patients is from our heart
 
00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
we give them all the information have
 
00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:38.600 align:start position:0%
already done the ultrasound that's how
 
00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:40.760 align:start position:0%
we diagnose these anomalies we've done
 
00:29:42.549 --> 00:29:42.559 align:start position:0%
the testing and we've talked about all
 
00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:44.240 align:start position:0%
possible options and sometimes it isn't
 
00:29:45.549 --> 00:29:45.559 align:start position:0%
an abortion that these patients have to
 
00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:47.640 align:start position:0%
undergo they have to undergo a C-section
 
00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:49.640 align:start position:0%
or even a vaginal delivery having to
 
00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
undergo the process of Labor without
 
00:29:54.029 --> 00:29:54.039 align:start position:0%
ever um holding their baby alive in
 
00:29:56.029 --> 00:29:56.039 align:start position:0%
their hands and that is something that
 
00:29:59.310 --> 00:29:59.320 align:start position:0%
is so devastating um I remember having a
 
00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:01.240 align:start position:0%
patient of my own been trying for years
 
00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
to achieve a pregnancy undergoing
 
00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:04.360 align:start position:0%
treatments for fertility and praying for
 
00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:06.200 align:start position:0%
a child she was herself a religious
 
00:30:08.269 --> 00:30:08.279 align:start position:0%
person really attached to the idea of
 
00:30:10.389 --> 00:30:10.399 align:start position:0%
becoming a mother um but when she found
 
00:30:12.549 --> 00:30:12.559 align:start position:0%
out that her baby had what they call an
 
00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:15.200 align:start position:0%
and seph or a lack of a forbrain um and
 
00:30:17.029 --> 00:30:17.039 align:start position:0%
that the baby would not survive she
 
00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
spoke to ICU pediatricians MFS doctors
 
00:30:21.509 --> 00:30:21.519 align:start position:0%
about her chances for survival talked to
 
00:30:23.509 --> 00:30:23.519 align:start position:0%
her chaplain talked to her family and
 
00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:25.880 align:start position:0%
talked to us and we did our very best to
 
00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
give her options I remember being in her
 
00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:31.320 align:start position:0%
delivery room and watching her deliver
 
00:30:33.669 --> 00:30:33.679 align:start position:0%
her um baby and having to hold her baby
 
00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:35.640 align:start position:0%
as her partner in her cried and there
 
00:30:37.789 --> 00:30:37.799 align:start position:0%
was not a single dry eye in the room
 
00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:40.440 align:start position:0%
everyone's heart was broken for them the
 
00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
fact that you are going to be punishing
 
00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
people with this bill HP 622
 
00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:46.720 align:start position:0%
criminalizing a decision that no one
 
00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:49.000 align:start position:0%
ever wants to make is absolutely
 
00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:51.200 align:start position:0%
egregious and it makes all of us who
 
00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
work so hard for our patients feel that
 
00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
we have do our job adequately that
 
00:30:59.070 --> 00:30:59.080 align:start position:0%
somehow now our jobs are not being done
 
00:31:00.590 --> 00:31:00.600 align:start position:0%
to the best of their abilities and that
 
00:31:03.629 --> 00:31:03.639 align:start position:0%
is in fact so un these people have
 
00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:05.200 align:start position:0%
chosen the colors in their baby's
 
00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
bedrooms and yet now you're telling them
 
00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
they're criminals for having to make a
 
00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:13.000 align:start position:0%
choice no person no God no external
 
00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:16.240 align:start position:0%
being would ever want another person so
 
00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
I humbly please do not place any more
 
00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:20.600 align:start position:0%
pain on my patients who've had to make
 
00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
these choices and undergo these
 
00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
harrowing experiences my patients
 
00:31:25.509 --> 00:31:25.519 align:start position:0%
deserve their lawmaker respect and
 
00:31:26.789 --> 00:31:26.799 align:start position:0%
understanding and the right to make
 
00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
their own medical decisions that's best
 
00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:29.960 align:start position:0%
for themselves their family and their
 
00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
circumstances circumstances that are so
 
00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
unique circumstances that one single
 
00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:37.480 align:start position:0%
Bill cannot cover and cannot even fathom
 
00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:40.240 align:start position:0%
the diversity of those circumstances so
 
00:31:43.509 --> 00:31:43.519 align:start position:0%
I ask that we protect those who deserve
 
00:31:46.029 --> 00:31:46.039 align:start position:0%
a safe access to Safe Care and a safe
 
00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
abortion setting when unexpected events

and the exec board I strongly support
 
00:33:18.430 --> 00:33:18.440 align:start position:0%
these bills house bill
 
00:33:21.509 --> 00:33:21.519 align:start position:0%
2625 and House Bill
 
00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
622 for far too long New Hampshire has
 
00:33:27.389 --> 00:33:27.399 align:start position:0%
been one of the few states in the nation
 
00:33:30.990 --> 00:33:31.000 align:start position:0%
that allow abortion at any point for any
 
00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
reason with taxpayer
 
00:33:36.269 --> 00:33:36.279 align:start position:0%
funding it is one out of three states in
 
00:33:38.909 --> 00:33:38.919 align:start position:0%
the nation that has no statistics on
 
00:33:41.789 --> 00:33:41.799 align:start position:0%
this procedure it doesn't have any
 
00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
inspections on abortion facilities and
 
00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:47.960 align:start position:0%
it is only one out a few states without
 
00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:50.600 align:start position:0%
protections concerning pre-born
 
00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
children these house bills seek only to
 
00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
honor distinctions made in legal
 
00:33:58.029 --> 00:33:58.039 align:start position:0%
precedent and in Planned Parenthood
 
00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
versus Casey regarding
 
00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:04.600 align:start position:0%
viability not only can babies feel pain
 
00:34:07.909 --> 00:34:07.919 align:start position:0%
starting at 21 weeks but they can also
 
00:34:09.950 --> 00:34:09.960 align:start position:0%
survive outside of the mother when
 
00:34:13.829 --> 00:34:13.839 align:start position:0%
delivered or in other words are viable
 
00:34:17.349 --> 00:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
at 24 weeks full disclosure I am a
 
00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
Protestant Christian and I do believe
 
00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
that life does begin at conception and
 
00:34:25.869 --> 00:34:25.879 align:start position:0%
believe there should be no reason to
 
00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
have an abort for any
 
00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:32.200 align:start position:0%
reason but New Hampshire by passing this
 
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
bill passing these two bills excuse me
 
00:34:37.990 --> 00:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
would be joining the majority of States
 
00:34:40.950 --> 00:34:40.960 align:start position:0%
some de Democratic in placing some
 
00:34:42.909 --> 00:34:42.919 align:start position:0%
restrictions on late term
 
00:34:45.990 --> 00:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
abortions there will be absolutely no
 
00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
new Criminal penalties on providers who
 
00:34:52.109 --> 00:34:52.119 align:start position:0%
violate the law the bill will simply
 
00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
apply the same class B penalties in
 
00:34:57.470 --> 00:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
place for one late term abortion
 
00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
for all lat term procedures and it only
 
00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
applies to doctors who intentionally
 
00:35:06.829 --> 00:35:06.839 align:start position:0%
violate the law not those who do it
 
00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:09.320 align:start position:0%
accidentally and there will absolutely
 
00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:13.160 align:start position:0%
be no criminal penalties for the mothers
 
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
who choose to have this
 
00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
procedure Common Sense laws regarding
 
00:35:20.109 --> 00:35:20.119 align:start position:0%
protecting pre-born children and their
 
00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
mothers is a no-brainer so please
 
00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:27.640 align:start position:0%
support House Bill 625 and 622

Obstetrics and Gynecology because I want
 
00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
to help women through Monumental

lifechanging experiences that includes
 
00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:29.240 align:start position:0%
desired pregnancies and child birth but
 
00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:32.200 align:start position:0%
that also includes challenging and life
 
00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:34.720 align:start position:0%
um altering and devastating situations
 
00:36:37.150 --> 00:36:37.160 align:start position:0%
like pregnancy loss abnormal fetal

diagnosis and Family Planning I'm here
 
00:36:42.109 --> 00:36:42.119 align:start position:0%
today to join many of my colleagues in
 
00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
opposing House Bill 622 and House Bill
 
00:36:48.069 --> 00:36:48.079 align:start position:0%
625 there are many reasons that women
 
00:36:50.069 --> 00:36:50.079 align:start position:0%
May seek to undergo an abortion
 
00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
procedure and as a physician and also as
 
00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:54.680 align:start position:0%
a woman I do feel strongly that women
 
00:36:56.270 --> 00:36:56.280 align:start position:0%
should be able to make their own
 
00:36:58.470 --> 00:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
personal and private healthare decisions
 
00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:00.800 align:start position:0%
without politicians standing in that way
 
00:37:02.990 --> 00:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
no matter where we live representative
 
00:37:05.109 --> 00:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
Stapleton subm stated in his bill
 
00:37:07.349 --> 00:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
submission that he recognizes the need
 
00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
for case-by casee consideration for
 
00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
individual needs and circumstances
 
00:37:14.109 --> 00:37:14.119 align:start position:0%
however his proposed Bill negates just
 
00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:16.200 align:start position:0%
that and it poses a health risk to the
 
00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:18.640 align:start position:0%
women of our state these bills limit
 
00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:21.400 align:start position:0%
access to life-saving procedures
 
00:37:23.309 --> 00:37:23.319 align:start position:0%
abortion later in pregnancy may be
 
00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
necessary when complications severely
 
00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:27.160 align:start position:0%
compromise a woman's health
 
00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
or her life and there these are
 
00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
conditions that can also reduce um the
 
00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
possibility of survival that includes
 
00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:37.640 align:start position:0%
preclampsia infection premature rupture
 
00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:40.640 align:start position:0%
of membranes placental abruption and
 
00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
other conditions that can put women at
 
00:37:45.589 --> 00:37:45.599 align:start position:0%
risk for extensive blood loss for stroke
 
00:37:48.109 --> 00:37:48.119 align:start position:0%
for septic shock and lead to maternal
 
00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:52.079 align:start position:0%
death we shouldn't wait for a medical
 
00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
condition to worsen and become
 
00:37:56.109 --> 00:37:56.119 align:start position:0%
life-threatening before offering
 
00:37:58.750 --> 00:37:58.760 align:start position:0%
patients the option for an abortion at a
 
00:38:01.589 --> 00:38:01.599 align:start position:0%
safer period of time in that
 
00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:03.640 align:start position:0%
pregnancy the other thing I'd like to
 
00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
mention is that these bills do have an
 
00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:06.790 align:start position:0%
mention is that these bills do have an
unintended

00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
unintended
 
00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:09.240 align:start position:0%
repercussions for healthc care providers
 
00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:11.400 align:start position:0%
in our state it advertises to the
 
00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
country that New Hampshire is not a
 
00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
friendly environment for health care
 
00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:16.390 align:start position:0%
friendly environment for health care
providers

00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
providers
 
00:38:19.390 --> 00:38:19.400 align:start position:0%
the country is already in a national
 
00:38:21.550 --> 00:38:21.560 align:start position:0%
shortfall of primary care providers and
 
00:38:23.829 --> 00:38:23.839 align:start position:0%
obstetrician and gynecologists AOG or
 
00:38:25.309 --> 00:38:25.319 align:start position:0%
the American College of obstetrician and
 
00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
gynecologists PR L projected a national
 
00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:31.240 align:start position:0%
shortfall of OBGYNs of up to 22,000 by
 
00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
the year 2050 and they estimated that
 
00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:36.920 align:start position:0%
half of us counties lack a single OBGYN
 
00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:39.200 align:start position:0%
what a better way to discourage the next
 
00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:40.640 align:start position:0%
wave of healthc care providers from
 
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
coming to our state of New Hampshire
 
00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
than threatening to charge them with a
 
00:38:47.829 --> 00:38:47.839 align:start position:0%
felony for providing evidence-based Care
 
00:38:50.309 --> 00:38:50.319 align:start position:0%
by punishing not only patients who seek
 
00:38:53.069 --> 00:38:53.079 align:start position:0%
to have safe established and accepted
 
00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
medical care but also by punishing their
 
00:38:56.950 --> 00:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
providers you send a des Dean dangerous
 
00:38:59.630 --> 00:38:59.640 align:start position:0%
message about access to healthcare this
 
00:39:01.870 --> 00:39:01.880 align:start position:0%
bill will negatively impact all women of
 
00:39:03.349 --> 00:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire your daughters your
 
00:39:05.109 --> 00:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
sisters your mothers your friends who
 
00:39:06.990 --> 00:39:07.000 align:start position:0%
seek out care for everyday health issues
 
00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:09.560 align:start position:0%
for pregnancy for gynecologic care I
 
00:39:11.349 --> 00:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
believe that both of these bills are bad
 
00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:13.280 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire and I really strongly
 
00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:16.280 align:start position:0%
encourage you to oppose it I'd just also
 
00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:17.720 align:start position:0%
like to point out that this bill is
 
00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
opposed by many um state government
 
00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
government bodies including the American
 
00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:22.720 align:start position:0%

00:39:28.309 --> 00:39:28.319 align:start position:0%
written testimony that I've submitted as
 
00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much representative
 
00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:32.920 align:start position:0%
silver did you have a question I do have
 
00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:35.480 align:start position:0%
a question for the doctor uh could you
 
00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
tell us whether at Dartmouth uh they
 
00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
perform abortions on fetuses that are
 
00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:45.240 align:start position:0%
gestational age of 24 weeks or
 
00:39:49.349 --> 00:39:49.359 align:start position:0%
older um I I have not personally done
 
00:39:52.670 --> 00:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
and I and I am I would have to defer um
 
00:39:57.069 --> 00:39:57.079 align:start position:0%
that gestational age is an age at which
 
00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:02.240 align:start position:0%
um at which few women um seek abortion
 
00:40:04.829 --> 00:40:04.839 align:start position:0%
and so I am not sure at that particular
 
00:40:07.829 --> 00:40:07.839 align:start position:0%
gestational age um whether or not that
 
00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:12.640 align:start position:0%
happens it's exceedingly uncommon and
 
00:40:16.190 --> 00:40:16.200 align:start position:0%
and um if it did my suspicion would be
 
00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:19.000 align:start position:0%
that it would be in the case of uh a
 
00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:22.480 align:start position:0%
fetus that did not have um an ability to
 
00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:24.440 align:start position:0%
maintain its own life outside of the
 
00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:26.920 align:start position:0%
womb Mr chair followup please yes you
 
00:40:29.589 --> 00:40:29.599 align:start position:0%
may uh doctor have you ever performed an
 
00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
abortion where the gestational age of
 
00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
the aborted fetus was 24 weeks or
 
00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:40.720 align:start position:0%
over no I have not thank

have you seen um based on other states a
 
00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
dramatic and sustained decline in the
 
00:40:54.190 --> 00:40:54.200 align:start position:0%
next gener generation of healthcare
 
00:40:57.510 --> 00:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
providers um in the states that have um
 
00:40:59.829 --> 00:40:59.839 align:start position:0%
the law in
 
00:41:04.109 --> 00:41:04.119 align:start position:0%
place um I do not have the statistics to
 
00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:07.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily look at that but I um I can
 
00:41:13.630 --> 00:41:13.640 align:start position:0%
say that for myself um I I would I would
 
00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
be nervous um going to and practicing in
 
00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
a state that has very um strict
 
00:41:23.069 --> 00:41:23.079 align:start position:0%
restrictions um on the care that I am
 
00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:25.240 align:start position:0%

capacity to support House Bill 625 and
 
00:42:17.829 --> 00:42:17.839 align:start position:0%
not to speak about the other
 
00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:20.720 align:start position:0%
bill in my practice I follow women
 
00:42:22.549 --> 00:42:22.559 align:start position:0%
throughout their reproductive years
 
00:42:24.349 --> 00:42:24.359 align:start position:0%
including prenatally as well as
 
00:42:27.349 --> 00:42:27.359 align:start position:0%
high-risk obstetrical care and as an
 
00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:30.640 align:start position:0%
OBGYN I have the privilege of caring for
 
00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
women and their unborn children through
 
00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:34.960 align:start position:0%
some of the most in Intimate joyful and
 
00:42:37.510 --> 00:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
heartbreaking moments of their
 
00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:40.760 align:start position:0%
lives as an obstetrician um my role is
 
00:42:43.069 --> 00:42:43.079 align:start position:0%
to assess the maternal as well as fetal
 
00:42:44.910 --> 00:42:44.920 align:start position:0%
status in any pregnant patient
 
00:42:48.270 --> 00:42:48.280 align:start position:0%
presenting for care in many hospitals
 
00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:50.720 align:start position:0%
including my own when a woman presents
 
00:42:53.230 --> 00:42:53.240 align:start position:0%
who is more than 20 weeks pregnant with
 
00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
any obstetrical concern including
 
00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
abdominal trauma
 
00:42:59.190 --> 00:42:59.200 align:start position:0%
we evaluate her on labor and delivery
 
00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
instead of the ER this allows us to
 
00:43:05.309 --> 00:43:05.319 align:start position:0%
rapidly assess the mother and feedus
 
00:43:07.549 --> 00:43:07.559 align:start position:0%
simultaneously and move quickly towards
 
00:43:10.270 --> 00:43:10.280 align:start position:0%
an operative delivery if indicated if
 
00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
she's more than 24 weeks pregnant the
 
00:43:15.109 --> 00:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
present standard of care is to offer
 
00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
full court press or complete obstetric
 
00:43:20.309 --> 00:43:20.319 align:start position:0%
and neonatal
 
00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
interventions for example if a mother is
 
00:43:25.150 --> 00:43:25.160 align:start position:0%
bleeding heavily or the fetal heart rate
 
00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:28.240 align:start position:0%
is low we would rapidly deliver V
 
00:43:30.349 --> 00:43:30.359 align:start position:0%
C-section if indicated to save both the
 
00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:33.240 align:start position:0%
mother's and the baby's life if the
 
00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:34.480 align:start position:0%
mother is diagnosed with a
 
00:43:36.190 --> 00:43:36.200 align:start position:0%
life-threatening infection we will
 
00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
administer antibiotics and act to
 
00:43:41.230 --> 00:43:41.240 align:start position:0%
deliver with subsequent resuscitation of
 
00:43:43.829 --> 00:43:43.839 align:start position:0%
the newborn if greater than 24
 
00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:46.720 align:start position:0%
weeks our neonatal intensive care units
 
00:43:48.549 --> 00:43:48.559 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire are well equipped to
 
00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
care for these very pre-term infants and
 
00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
can accept transfers from smaller
 
00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
Community Hospitals who do not have
 
00:43:56.790 --> 00:43:56.800 align:start position:0%
higher level
 
00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:00.440 align:start position:0%
units thus an abortion ban at 24 weeks
 
00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:03.160 align:start position:0%
is not a restriction on current medical
 
00:44:05.790 --> 00:44:05.800 align:start position:0%
practice but rather supports the current
 
00:44:08.069 --> 00:44:08.079 align:start position:0%
practice of full neonatal interventions
 
00:44:10.510 --> 00:44:10.520 align:start position:0%
for neonates delivered at 24 weeks just
 
00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:12.640 align:start position:0%
stational age or
 
00:44:15.150 --> 00:44:15.160 align:start position:0%
greater finally this bill is not
 
00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
intrusive or restrictive to The
 
00:44:19.349 --> 00:44:19.359 align:start position:0%
Physician patient relationship it
 
00:44:21.349 --> 00:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
appropriately allows the physician to
 
00:44:23.910 --> 00:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
evaluate her patient for a current
 
00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
medical emergency that could result in
 
00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:28.720 align:start position:0%
significant health risk to the woman
 
00:44:30.670 --> 00:44:30.680 align:start position:0%
this bill provides protection for all
 
00:44:34.349 --> 00:44:34.359 align:start position:0%
fetal patients greater than 24 weeks
 
00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
thank you and I'm happy to take
 
00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:39.160 align:start position:0%

well-being but the fetal well-being as

well there are well accepted standards
 
00:46:55.390 --> 00:46:55.400 align:start position:0%
of care relating to both patients from
 
00:46:56.790 --> 00:46:56.800 align:start position:0%
the early earliest stages of the
 
00:46:59.390 --> 00:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
pregnancy until delivery and the science
 
00:47:01.390 --> 00:47:01.400 align:start position:0%
is clear that fetal human beings are
 
00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
fully human and alive I care routinely
 
00:47:06.349 --> 00:47:06.359 align:start position:0%
for patients who deliver pre-term

infants even as early as 23 weeks who
 
00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
are then successfully cared for after
 
00:47:13.390 --> 00:47:13.400 align:start position:0%
delivery because of amazing advancements
 
00:47:15.790 --> 00:47:15.800 align:start position:0%
in the field of neonatology as well as
 
00:47:18.589 --> 00:47:18.599 align:start position:0%
obstetrics infants born at 24 weeks now
 
00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
have a 70 to 80% survival rate most of
 
00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
them without significant impairments
 
00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:25.240 align:start position:0%
when active resuscitation efforts are
 
00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:26.430 align:start position:0%
when active resuscitation efforts are
done

00:47:26.430 --> 00:47:26.440 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:47:28.349 --> 00:47:28.359 align:start position:0%
these survival rates are increasing the
 
00:47:30.349 --> 00:47:30.359 align:start position:0%
more evidence we have of the benefits of
 
00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:32.240 align:start position:0%
active interventions for the neonates at
 
00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
these gational ages in fact the

University of Iowa one of the leaders in
 
00:47:38.790 --> 00:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
the US in regards to Nikki care for
 
00:47:41.150 --> 00:47:41.160 align:start position:0%
premature infants recently published
 
00:47:42.910 --> 00:47:42.920 align:start position:0%
their data showing that with a policy of
 
00:47:44.710 --> 00:47:44.720 align:start position:0%
nearly Universal interventions for
 
00:47:48.030 --> 00:47:48.040 align:start position:0%
infants born at 22 to 24 weeks survival
 
00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
rates at 24 weeks approach
 
00:47:53.790 --> 00:47:53.800 align:start position:0%
90% per the gut marcker Institute the
 
00:47:55.790 --> 00:47:55.800 align:start position:0%
majority of women who have abortions in
 
00:47:57.950 --> 00:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
the second trimester do so for the same
 
00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
reasons as those in the first which are
 
00:48:03.109 --> 00:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
largely socioeconomic reasons an
 
00:48:05.150 --> 00:48:05.160 align:start position:0%
abortion ban at 24 weeks is not
 
00:48:06.870 --> 00:48:06.880 align:start position:0%
intrusive into the physician patient
 
00:48:08.750 --> 00:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
relationship but rather consistent with
 
00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:11.400 align:start position:0%
current Medical Science in fact in a
 
00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
joint statement from 2016 the American
 
00:48:15.910 --> 00:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
College of OBGYN and the society for
 
00:48:18.109 --> 00:48:18.119 align:start position:0%
Maternal Fetal Medicine recommended that
 
00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
at 24 weeks all normal obstetric and
 
00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
neonatal interventions be employed
 
00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
adopting this policy would show that the
 
00:48:26.910 --> 00:48:26.920 align:start position:0%
state of New cares about all of its
 
00:48:29.309 --> 00:48:29.319 align:start position:0%
citizens especially its most
 
00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
vulnerable this will not in any way
 
00:48:33.470 --> 00:48:33.480 align:start position:0%
jeopardize the lives of women in fact
 
00:48:35.150 --> 00:48:35.160 align:start position:0%
the mortality rate associated with
 
00:48:38.670 --> 00:48:38.680 align:start position:0%
abortion increases by 38% for every week
 
00:48:40.230 --> 00:48:40.240 align:start position:0%
Beyond eight weeks gestation and
 
00:48:42.670 --> 00:48:42.680 align:start position:0%
abortion is done making abortions done
 
00:48:45.069 --> 00:48:45.079 align:start position:0%
after 24 weeks significantly higher risk
 
00:48:47.630 --> 00:48:47.640 align:start position:0%
for women in the rare circumstance in
 
00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
which a woman's life is endangered by
 
00:48:51.630 --> 00:48:51.640 align:start position:0%
pregnancy complications Beyond 24 weeks
 
00:48:54.030 --> 00:48:54.040 align:start position:0%
she can be quickly delivered in fact
 
00:48:55.870 --> 00:48:55.880 align:start position:0%
much more quickly than an abortion at
 
00:48:58.430 --> 00:48:58.440 align:start position:0%
this gational age and both she and her
 
00:49:01.109 --> 00:49:01.119 align:start position:0%
baby taken care of this is in complete
 
00:49:02.910 --> 00:49:02.920 align:start position:0%
alignment with standard practiced by the
 
00:49:04.270 --> 00:49:04.280 align:start position:0%
vast majority of
 
00:49:08.190 --> 00:49:08.200 align:start position:0%
obgym in fact 85% of obgym do not
 
00:49:10.829 --> 00:49:10.839 align:start position:0%
perform abortions at any gestational age
 
00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
with exceedingly few performing them
 
00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
beyond the first trimester especially
 
00:49:17.190 --> 00:49:17.200 align:start position:0%
after viability this bill will not
 
00:49:19.670 --> 00:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
dissuade OBGYN from practicing in your
 
00:49:22.069 --> 00:49:22.079 align:start position:0%
state the policy of banning abortions
 
00:49:23.870 --> 00:49:23.880 align:start position:0%
Beyond 24 weeks would acknowledge the
 
00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
fact that infant born of this ational
 
00:49:29.109 --> 00:49:29.119 align:start position:0%
age are viable pain capable human beings
 
00:49:30.910 --> 00:49:30.920 align:start position:0%
deserving of the now standard medical
 
00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:33.680 align:start position:0%
care that is available it's in no way in
 
00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
truth on the relationship of a physician
 
00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:38.160 align:start position:0%

00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:40.640 align:start position:0%

Hampshire medical license in support of
 
00:53:32.349 --> 00:53:32.359 align:start position:0%
house spell 625 I submit this testimony
 
00:53:34.789 --> 00:53:34.799 align:start position:0%
the two decisions Row versus Wade in
 
00:53:37.630 --> 00:53:37.640 align:start position:0%
1973 and Casey versus Planned Parenthood
 
00:53:40.030 --> 00:53:40.040 align:start position:0%
in 1992 the United States Supreme Court
 
00:53:42.750 --> 00:53:42.760 align:start position:0%
affirmed three principles one women have
 
00:53:44.990 --> 00:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
the right to abort a pre viable fetus
 
00:53:46.789 --> 00:53:46.799 align:start position:0%
without undue interference from the
 
00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
state two the state may restrict
 
00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:52.240 align:start position:0%
abortion of the post viable petus and
 
00:53:54.109 --> 00:53:54.119 align:start position:0%
thirdly the state has a legitimate
 
00:53:56.190 --> 00:53:56.200 align:start position:0%
interest in protecting both the woman's
 
00:53:59.390 --> 00:53:59.400 align:start position:0%
health and the life of the petus house
 
00:54:02.710 --> 00:54:02.720 align:start position:0%
bill 625 does not violate any of these
 
00:54:05.190 --> 00:54:05.200 align:start position:0%
rulings of the Supreme Court in addition
 
00:54:07.470 --> 00:54:07.480 align:start position:0%
this bill does not open the gate for a
 
00:54:09.349 --> 00:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
flood of legislation that would seek to
 
00:54:11.109 --> 00:54:11.119 align:start position:0%
criminalize medical
 
00:54:13.349 --> 00:54:13.359 align:start position:0%
procedures abortion is not a procedure
 
00:54:15.309 --> 00:54:15.319 align:start position:0%
that cures a disease or except in the
 
00:54:18.150 --> 00:54:18.160 align:start position:0%
rarest of occasions Saves a Life it is
 
00:54:20.510 --> 00:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
not the procedure that is being
 
00:54:22.990 --> 00:54:23.000 align:start position:0%
criminalized it is the result of the
 
00:54:26.069 --> 00:54:26.079 align:start position:0%
procedure that makes it penus as OST

procedure that removes a cancer

gallbladder this bill in no way
 
00:55:00.390 --> 00:55:00.400 align:start position:0%
establishes a precedent to criminalize
 
00:55:02.030 --> 00:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
the everyday procedures that are
 
00:55:04.589 --> 00:55:04.599 align:start position:0%
performed to save and improve the lives

of the sick and the injured and as I
 
00:55:08.549 --> 00:55:08.559 align:start position:0%
said it is not the procedure but the
 
00:55:10.430 --> 00:55:10.440 align:start position:0%
result of the procedure that makes it a
 
00:55:13.470 --> 00:55:13.480 align:start position:0%
class be felony you and the medical
 
00:55:15.390 --> 00:55:15.400 align:start position:0%
profession do not need to fear that this
 
00:55:16.750 --> 00:55:16.760 align:start position:0%
is a stepping stone to the
 
00:55:19.150 --> 00:55:19.160 align:start position:0%
criminalization of medical procedures
 
00:55:20.870 --> 00:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
this bill is simply following the
 
00:55:23.910 --> 00:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
guidance to you by the Supreme Court to
 
00:55:26.670 --> 00:55:26.680 align:start position:0%

my name is Hillary Kil Cullen from
 
00:56:35.349 --> 00:56:35.359 align:start position:0%
conquered New Hampshire I've been a
 
00:56:38.309 --> 00:56:38.319 align:start position:0%
physician assistant for 42 years
 
00:56:39.990 --> 00:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
practicing here in New Hampshire for
 
00:56:42.829 --> 00:56:42.839 align:start position:0%
most of them when I first came to New
 
00:56:45.390 --> 00:56:45.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the argument
 
00:56:48.950 --> 00:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
pro-abortion was for a safe and rare
 
00:56:51.950 --> 00:56:51.960 align:start position:0%
option for women facing a difficult
 
00:56:55.349 --> 00:56:55.359 align:start position:0%
situation the option now allow ows for
 
00:56:58.549 --> 00:56:58.559 align:start position:0%
terminating unborn children for any
 
00:57:02.670 --> 00:57:02.680 align:start position:0%
reason at any stage or for no reason at
 
00:57:04.109 --> 00:57:04.119 align:start position:0%
that for that
 
00:57:07.150 --> 00:57:07.160 align:start position:0%
matter we medical professionals have
 
00:57:11.750 --> 00:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely no ability whatsoever to
 
00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:13.069 align:start position:0%
absolutely no ability whatsoever to
create

00:57:13.069 --> 00:57:13.079 align:start position:0%
create
 
00:57:17.230 --> 00:57:17.240 align:start position:0%
life but we do have the power to destroy
 
00:57:20.349 --> 00:57:20.359 align:start position:0%
it of course destruction of life is
 
00:57:23.470 --> 00:57:23.480 align:start position:0%
against all the we train and strive
 
00:57:26.750 --> 00:57:26.760 align:start position:0%
for so have to twist the reality around
 
00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
and come up with some explanation that
 
00:57:32.829 --> 00:57:32.839 align:start position:0%
puts terminating unborn life on an equal
 
00:57:35.870 --> 00:57:35.880 align:start position:0%
footing with Justice compassion and love
 
00:57:35.880 --> 00:57:36.710 align:start position:0%
footing with Justice compassion and love
for

00:57:36.710 --> 00:57:36.720 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:57:40.510 --> 00:57:40.520 align:start position:0%
others and we do that by saying it's
 
00:57:43.109 --> 00:57:43.119 align:start position:0%
none of our business it's between a
 
00:57:44.789 --> 00:57:44.799 align:start position:0%
woman and her
 
00:57:47.390 --> 00:57:47.400 align:start position:0%
provider our country today is full of
 
00:57:51.029 --> 00:57:51.039 align:start position:0%
violence anger disrespect depression how
 
00:57:53.990 --> 00:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
do we get here people are asking
 
00:57:55.549 --> 00:57:55.559 align:start position:0%
probably in the same same way our hearts
 
00:57:58.029 --> 00:57:58.039 align:start position:0%
and Minds went from being saddened and
 
00:58:00.390 --> 00:58:00.400 align:start position:0%
resistant to killing The Unborn to
 
00:58:03.430 --> 00:58:03.440 align:start position:0%

name is Jeanie haruska I'm the political
 
00:59:42.750 --> 00:59:42.760 align:start position:0%
director for the American civil
 
00:59:45.150 --> 00:59:45.160 align:start position:0%
liberties Union of New Hampshire and I
 
00:59:46.750 --> 00:59:46.760 align:start position:0%
really appreciate the opportunity to
 
00:59:49.710 --> 00:59:49.720 align:start position:0%
testify today in opposition to both HB
 
00:59:53.349 --> 00:59:53.359 align:start position:0%
625 and HB 622 which would deny
 
00:59:55.510 --> 00:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
Healthcare to people who need need it
 
00:59:57.470 --> 00:59:57.480 align:start position:0%
viability is nearly impossible to
 
00:59:59.630 --> 00:59:59.640 align:start position:0%
determine in utero it differs one
 
01:00:01.430 --> 01:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
pregnancy to another and can differ
 
01:00:04.230 --> 01:00:04.240 align:start position:0%
depending on the healthcare facility HB
 
01:00:07.589 --> 01:00:07.599 align:start position:0%
625 would deny would defy science and
 
01:00:09.789 --> 01:00:09.799 align:start position:0%
medicine by defining viability with an
 
01:00:11.470 --> 01:00:11.480 align:start position:0%
arbitrary number and restricting
 
01:00:13.549 --> 01:00:13.559 align:start position:0%
people's Access to Health Care based off
 
01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:17.200 align:start position:0%
of it moreover HB 625 also has a very
 
01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
limited exception that applies only to
 
01:00:21.309 --> 01:00:21.319 align:start position:0%
the life and quote physical health of
 
01:00:23.430 --> 01:00:23.440 align:start position:0%
the pregnant person this narrow
 
01:00:24.870 --> 01:00:24.880 align:start position:0%
exception excludes people people who
 
01:00:26.870 --> 01:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
become pregnant due to rape or incest
 
01:00:28.589 --> 01:00:28.599 align:start position:0%
and the narrow exception excludes
 
01:00:30.990 --> 01:00:31.000 align:start position:0%
abortion Services necessary for the
 
01:00:33.029 --> 01:00:33.039 align:start position:0%
emotional or psychological health of the
 
01:00:35.390 --> 01:00:35.400 align:start position:0%
pregnant person or other considerations
 
01:00:37.150 --> 01:00:37.160 align:start position:0%
as determined by a patient and their
 
01:00:41.109 --> 01:00:41.119 align:start position:0%
doctor for its part HB 622 imposes a
 
01:00:42.870 --> 01:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
requirement that a pregnant person be
 
01:00:45.829 --> 01:00:45.839 align:start position:0%
quote adequately informed without
 
01:00:48.349 --> 01:00:48.359 align:start position:0%
defining what that means more alarming
 
01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
is the Bill's requirement that a
 
01:00:51.789 --> 01:00:51.799 align:start position:0%
pregnant person be quote open to the
 
01:00:54.109 --> 01:00:54.119 align:start position:0%
counsel of her husband spousal partner
 
01:00:57.029 --> 01:00:57.039 align:start position:0%
family or advisor this implies that a
 
01:00:59.270 --> 01:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
patient is not only unable but is not
 
01:01:01.109 --> 01:01:01.119 align:start position:0%
allowed to make their own decision
 
01:01:02.589 --> 01:01:02.599 align:start position:0%
regarding their own health in
 
01:01:04.589 --> 01:01:04.599 align:start position:0%
consultation with their doctor but
 
01:01:07.150 --> 01:01:07.160 align:start position:0%
instead m al must also be counseled by
 
01:01:09.510 --> 01:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
Family while many patients likely do
 
01:01:11.230 --> 01:01:11.240 align:start position:0%
consult with their family and spouse it
 
01:01:13.390 --> 01:01:13.400 align:start position:0%
is patronizing to require that they do
 
01:01:16.109 --> 01:01:16.119 align:start position:0%
so by law I would beg this committee to
 
01:01:17.870 --> 01:01:17.880 align:start position:0%
point to a problem in our state that
 
01:01:20.230 --> 01:01:20.240 align:start position:0%
these bills solve medical decisions
 
01:01:23.029 --> 01:01:23.039 align:start position:0%
later in pregnancies are never easy
 
01:01:25.309 --> 01:01:25.319 align:start position:0%
which is why doctors and patients are
 
01:01:27.950 --> 01:01:27.960 align:start position:0%
best positioned to weigh all the factors
 
01:01:30.630 --> 01:01:30.640 align:start position:0%
and make the best decision they can the
 
01:01:32.309 --> 01:01:32.319 align:start position:0%
government does not help by putting
 
01:01:34.430 --> 01:01:34.440 align:start position:0%
those decisions under a microscope and
 
01:01:36.750 --> 01:01:36.760 align:start position:0%
threatening criminal liability I
 
01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
respectfully urge the members of this
 
01:01:40.190 --> 01:01:40.200 align:start position:0%
committee to vote inexpedient to
 
01:01:44.589 --> 01:01:44.599 align:start position:0%
legislate on both HB 625 and 622 thank
 
01:01:47.190 --> 01:01:47.200 align:start position:0%

support of House Bill
 
01:03:01.990 --> 01:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
625 um as you probably know over the
 
01:03:05.589 --> 01:03:05.599 align:start position:0%
years we've actively advocated on all
 
01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
sorts of issues relating to life and
 
01:03:10.630 --> 01:03:10.640 align:start position:0%
human dignity so we've supported repeal
 
01:03:11.789 --> 01:03:11.799 align:start position:0%
of the death
 
01:03:15.109 --> 01:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
penalty we've stood up for uh the rights
 
01:03:18.829 --> 01:03:18.839 align:start position:0%
of immigrants we have uh sought
 
01:03:21.549 --> 01:03:21.559 align:start position:0%
protections for victims of human
 
01:03:24.029 --> 01:03:24.039 align:start position:0%
trafficking and we support this bill for
 
01:03:26.309 --> 01:03:26.319 align:start position:0%
examp exactly the same
 
01:03:29.630 --> 01:03:29.640 align:start position:0%
reasons as you consider what to do with
 
01:03:32.349 --> 01:03:32.359 align:start position:0%
this bill um I'd like to ask you to
 
01:03:36.349 --> 01:03:36.359 align:start position:0%
think about the question of how the
 
01:03:39.430 --> 01:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
issue of abortion as controversial as it
 
01:03:42.950 --> 01:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
is resonates in other areas
 
01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
also if we want Society to respect and
 
01:03:49.309 --> 01:03:49.319 align:start position:0%
value the child who is a
 
01:03:52.269 --> 01:03:52.279 align:start position:0%
refugee with a child who is homeless
 
01:03:54.390 --> 01:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
with a child who doesn't have access to
 
01:03:57.750 --> 01:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
health care then we have to respect and
 
01:04:00.510 --> 01:04:00.520 align:start position:0%
value the child in the womb as
 
01:04:03.470 --> 01:04:03.480 align:start position:0%
well if Society decides that certain
 
01:04:06.789 --> 01:04:06.799 align:start position:0%
ones of us can be treated as
 
01:04:10.269 --> 01:04:10.279 align:start position:0%
Expendable we should not be surprised if
 
01:04:14.470 --> 01:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
Society treats certain ones of us as
 
01:04:17.789 --> 01:04:17.799 align:start position:0%
Expendable and so I ask you to vote in
 
01:04:19.789 --> 01:04:19.799 align:start position:0%
favor of House Bill
 
01:04:21.670 --> 01:04:21.680 align:start position:0%

can hi thank you so much for taking your
 
01:05:09.190 --> 01:05:09.200 align:start position:0%
time I really appreciate it I'm here
 
01:05:11.150 --> 01:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
speaking on behalf of myself I'm a New
 
01:05:14.589 --> 01:05:14.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire resident uh I'm just here to
 
01:05:18.029 --> 01:05:18.039 align:start position:0%
um support this bill HB
 
01:05:20.549 --> 01:05:20.559 align:start position:0%
625 uh I am currently pregnant and I
 
01:05:22.990 --> 01:05:23.000 align:start position:0%
support this bill I would like to boldly
 
01:05:25.829 --> 01:05:25.839 align:start position:0%
state that any form of abortion is
 
01:05:28.589 --> 01:05:28.599 align:start position:0%
murder there is forgiveness from God for
 
01:05:30.710 --> 01:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
those who have aborted or performed an
 
01:05:33.069 --> 01:05:33.079 align:start position:0%
abortion although his Amazing Grace does
 
01:05:36.069 --> 01:05:36.079 align:start position:0%
not condone the act of abortion I would
 
01:05:37.950 --> 01:05:37.960 align:start position:0%
like those here to consider that there
 
01:05:39.630 --> 01:05:39.640 align:start position:0%
are many options for women who are
 
01:05:41.670 --> 01:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
pregnant such as adoption foster care
 
01:05:44.109 --> 01:05:44.119 align:start position:0%
Etc and although it would be ideal that
 
01:05:46.109 --> 01:05:46.119 align:start position:0%
a baby remain with her own birth parents
 
01:05:49.069 --> 01:05:49.079 align:start position:0%
if the circumstance and safety allow as
 
01:05:51.549 --> 01:05:51.559 align:start position:0%
I support this bill I would like to even
 
01:05:53.549 --> 01:05:53.559 align:start position:0%
challenge those here today to consider
 
01:05:56.589 --> 01:05:56.599 align:start position:0%
that life begins at conception at just 5
 
01:05:57.950 --> 01:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
weeks pregnant I went to get an
 
01:06:00.670 --> 01:06:00.680 align:start position:0%
ultrasound and I saw the heartbeat of my
 
01:06:03.430 --> 01:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
precious baby it was just the size of my
 
01:06:05.870 --> 01:06:05.880 align:start position:0%
pinky fingernail I would like to ask
 
01:06:08.269 --> 01:06:08.279 align:start position:0%
those present um that they would
 
01:06:10.670 --> 01:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
consider passing a bill that would state
 
01:06:12.589 --> 01:06:12.599 align:start position:0%
that whenever the baby's heartbeat is
 
01:06:14.950 --> 01:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
found that abortion the murder of these
 
01:06:16.870 --> 01:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
precious children would become
 
01:06:19.150 --> 01:06:19.160 align:start position:0%
absolutely illegal thank you so much for
 
01:06:21.589 --> 01:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
your time I certainly support this bill
 
01:06:22.990 --> 01:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
and would again ask that you consider
 
01:06:24.990 --> 01:06:25.000 align:start position:0%
even going further that at the moment
 
01:06:26.630 --> 01:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
the heartbeat is detected that it would
 
01:06:29.069 --> 01:06:29.079 align:start position:0%
be illegal to perform abortion please
 
01:06:30.789 --> 01:06:30.799 align:start position:0%

01:06:32.750 --> 01:06:32.760 align:start position:0%

01:07:47.069 --> 01:07:47.079 align:start position:0%
name's Jane heg and I'm a resident of
 
01:07:50.510 --> 01:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
Manchester and I very much oppose both
 
01:07:51.910 --> 01:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
of these
 
01:07:55.510 --> 01:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
bills um I think that that we've reached
 
01:07:59.109 --> 01:07:59.119 align:start position:0%
kind of a standoff in this country on
 
01:08:03.870 --> 01:08:03.880 align:start position:0%
the subject of abortion and um I think
 
01:08:05.789 --> 01:08:05.799 align:start position:0%
very much that it should be a choice
 
01:08:08.990 --> 01:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
between a woman and her doctor when we
 
01:08:13.470 --> 01:08:13.480 align:start position:0%
continue to do violence and by trying to
 
01:08:16.669 --> 01:08:16.679 align:start position:0%
bring up these divisive issues over and
 
01:08:20.349 --> 01:08:20.359 align:start position:0%
over and over again all we're saying is
 
01:08:22.470 --> 01:08:22.480 align:start position:0%
that we don't trust women and we don't
 
01:08:25.870 --> 01:08:25.880 align:start position:0%
trust their doctors to make a reasonable
 
01:08:28.189 --> 01:08:28.199 align:start position:0%
and rational decision that takes into
 
01:08:31.950 --> 01:08:31.960 align:start position:0%
account the health of the mother and the
 
01:08:36.269 --> 01:08:36.279 align:start position:0%
wishes of the family and um we can't
 
01:08:38.510 --> 01:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
always legislate that a woman consults
 
01:08:42.309 --> 01:08:42.319 align:start position:0%
her family and um I just think that this
 
01:08:45.590 --> 01:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
is endlessly bringing up these bills
 
01:08:47.189 --> 01:08:47.199 align:start position:0%
that really aren't going to change the
 
01:08:49.470 --> 01:08:49.480 align:start position:0%
way that anyone practices are are
 
01:08:51.550 --> 01:08:51.560 align:start position:0%
divisive and I really wish that people
 
01:08:53.910 --> 01:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
who bring them up would just stop I I
 
01:08:58.390 --> 01:08:58.400 align:start position:0%
think it just reflects an obsession with
 
01:09:00.590 --> 01:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
a small piece of Flesh that's the size
 
01:09:01.910 --> 01:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
of a pinky
 
01:09:04.550 --> 01:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
fingernail you know we all love babies I
 
01:09:06.550 --> 01:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
have two beautiful children and I have
 
01:09:09.070 --> 01:09:09.080 align:start position:0%
three beautiful grandchildren but we
 
01:09:11.789 --> 01:09:11.799 align:start position:0%
need to have respect the needs and the
 
01:09:15.269 --> 01:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
wishes of each family and each women
 
01:09:19.070 --> 01:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
each woman to make choices on their own
 
01:09:23.149 --> 01:09:23.159 align:start position:0%
with the consultation of their doctors
 
01:09:24.910 --> 01:09:24.920 align:start position:0%
so thank thank you very
 
01:09:27.510 --> 01:09:27.520 align:start position:0%

restrictions um you know yeah I I would
 
01:09:48.669 --> 01:09:48.679 align:start position:0%
actually because I think most women make
 
01:09:51.789 --> 01:09:51.799 align:start position:0%
make take many things into consideration
 
01:09:53.829 --> 01:09:53.839 align:start position:0%
before they actually consider having an
 
01:09:55.950 --> 01:09:55.960 align:start position:0%
abortion it's not something that any
 
01:09:59.910 --> 01:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
woman would take lightly thank

need to be made at the time of
 
01:10:59.950 --> 01:10:59.960 align:start position:0%
diagnosis in such tragic situations
 
01:11:02.590 --> 01:11:02.600 align:start position:0%
delivering the Child Alive gives
 
01:11:04.630 --> 01:11:04.640 align:start position:0%
families the opportunity to spend
 
01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
precious time
 
01:11:09.030 --> 01:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
together and The Grieving and recovery
 
01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
process for the mother and her family
 
01:11:14.470 --> 01:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
goes much much better when children are
 
01:11:16.229 --> 01:11:16.239 align:start position:0%
delivered alive and families are given
 
01:11:19.229 --> 01:11:19.239 align:start position:0%
the chance to spend this precious time
 
01:11:21.350 --> 01:11:21.360 align:start position:0%

thank you for your succinct testimony
 
01:11:33.830 --> 01:11:33.840 align:start position:0%

Heidi

01:11:48.030 --> 01:11:48.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:51.830 --> 01:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
Heath good morning can you hear me we
 
01:11:54.390 --> 01:11:54.400 align:start position:0%
can thank you so much for your time this
 
01:11:56.030 --> 01:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
morning I'm the Reverend Heidi
 
01:11:58.790 --> 01:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
Carrington Heath I am an ordained
 
01:12:00.950 --> 01:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
minister and also a former Hospital
 
01:12:03.030 --> 01:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
chaplain who specialized in labor and
 
01:12:05.310 --> 01:12:05.320 align:start position:0%
delivery and I'm speaking this morning
 
01:12:08.229 --> 01:12:08.239 align:start position:0%
in opposition to this bill first and
 
01:12:10.149 --> 01:12:10.159 align:start position:0%
foremost I believe it is the
 
01:12:12.510 --> 01:12:12.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility of our legislators to
 
01:12:14.350 --> 01:12:14.360 align:start position:0%
trust women to make the health care
 
01:12:17.110 --> 01:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
decisions that are appropriate for them
 
01:12:19.790 --> 01:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
with their medical providers um I want
 
01:12:23.669 --> 01:12:23.679 align:start position:0%
to directly dispute the claim that all
 
01:12:26.070 --> 01:12:26.080 align:start position:0%
diagnosis in this vein can be made prior
 
01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
to 24 weeks that simply isn't true I
 
01:12:31.070 --> 01:12:31.080 align:start position:0%
worked with multiple women in my time in
 
01:12:34.030 --> 01:12:34.040 align:start position:0%
the hospital who received diagnosis
 
01:12:36.830 --> 01:12:36.840 align:start position:0%
quite late in pregnancy and forcing them
 
01:12:39.030 --> 01:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
to carry these pregnancies to term would
 
01:12:41.550 --> 01:12:41.560 align:start position:0%
have been incredibly traumatizing and in
 
01:12:43.590 --> 01:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
some cases really detrimental to their
 
01:12:47.870 --> 01:12:47.880 align:start position:0%
health ultimately as a minister um and
 
01:12:49.550 --> 01:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
as someone who has practiced in a
 
01:12:52.470 --> 01:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
hospital setting I believe this bill to
 
01:12:54.709 --> 01:12:54.719 align:start position:0%
be unconscious able and harmful to the
 
01:12:57.430 --> 01:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
health of women thank you very
 
01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:01.920 align:start position:0%

um consideration in whether we are pro

um we are for this house
 
01:14:07.430 --> 01:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
bill um
 
01:14:10.910 --> 01:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
624 um and other Bill

625 I just wanted to make sure you know
 
01:14:14.239 --> 01:14:15.709 align:start position:0%
625 I just wanted to make sure you know
that

01:14:15.709 --> 01:14:15.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:14:18.229 --> 01:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
um little
 
01:14:22.070 --> 01:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
children don't have a voice except for
 
01:14:26.350 --> 01:14:26.360 align:start position:0%
us and I really really would like to say
 
01:14:28.430 --> 01:14:28.440 align:start position:0%
that this house bill reminds me of a
 
01:14:30.350 --> 01:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
time when I witnessed a dog had been
 
01:14:33.830 --> 01:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
trying to to reach dry ground he was
 
01:14:35.910 --> 01:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
getting wearier by the moment because he
 
01:14:38.510 --> 01:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
just couldn't get out he had jumped into
 
01:14:40.510 --> 01:14:40.520 align:start position:0%
the Basin in the white mountain and it
 
01:14:43.390 --> 01:14:43.400 align:start position:0%
had no way to get to safety the harder
 
01:14:45.270 --> 01:14:45.280 align:start position:0%
the dog tried to swim out of his
 
01:14:47.510 --> 01:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
surroundings the weaker he
 
01:14:50.270 --> 01:14:50.280 align:start position:0%
became his master understanding the
 
01:14:52.350 --> 01:14:52.360 align:start position:0%
situation was about to jump in and
 
01:14:55.070 --> 01:14:55.080 align:start position:0%
rescue his beloved loved pet and then
 
01:14:56.990 --> 01:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
someone suggested that we look for a
 
01:14:58.910 --> 01:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
long stick or part of a branch that
 
01:15:01.310 --> 01:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
could be placed under the dog's collar
 
01:15:02.830 --> 01:15:02.840 align:start position:0%
and move him to
 
01:15:06.950 --> 01:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
safety everyone there helped ultimately
 
01:15:09.550 --> 01:15:09.560 align:start position:0%
the ideal stick with a small Hook was
 
01:15:12.270 --> 01:15:12.280 align:start position:0%
found moments later and the dog was
 
01:15:14.669 --> 01:15:14.679 align:start position:0%
rescued without his master jumping into
 
01:15:18.390 --> 01:15:18.400 align:start position:0%
the Basin personally I believe God
 
01:15:22.070 --> 01:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
performed a miracle that day simply put
 
01:15:24.550 --> 01:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
the master and his beloved pet can be
 
01:15:27.470 --> 01:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
compared with house bills 625 and this
 
01:15:30.910 --> 01:15:30.920 align:start position:0%
committee your committee the master was
 
01:15:33.030 --> 01:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
willing to put his life on the line for
 
01:15:37.430 --> 01:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
his pet you the judicial committee is
 
01:15:40.470 --> 01:15:40.480 align:start position:0%
charged to determine if the sanctity of
 
01:15:43.149 --> 01:15:43.159 align:start position:0%
life is being protected and preserved
 
01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
with The Unborn children because
 
01:15:49.709 --> 01:15:49.719 align:start position:0%
ultimately all human beings have human
 
01:15:53.270 --> 01:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
rights I wanted to present some facts
 
01:15:55.510 --> 01:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
science proves at the moment of
 
01:15:58.470 --> 01:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
consumption that the zot has a complete
 
01:16:02.950 --> 01:16:02.960 align:start position:0%
and unique set of 46 chromosomes 23 from
 
01:16:06.149 --> 01:16:06.159 align:start position:0%
Mom 23 from Dad which is the entire
 
01:16:06.159 --> 01:16:07.229 align:start position:0%
Mom 23 from Dad which is the entire
genetic

01:16:07.229 --> 01:16:07.239 align:start position:0%
genetic
 
01:16:10.590 --> 01:16:10.600 align:start position:0%
blueprint on a in a suitable environment
 
01:16:13.310 --> 01:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
and nutrition are all that this little
 
01:16:15.990 --> 01:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
zot needs to develop throughout the
 
01:16:19.669 --> 01:16:19.679 align:start position:0%
different stages of human life you see
 
01:16:22.470 --> 01:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
science proves that at six days old the
 
01:16:26.070 --> 01:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
embryo the blast of scy attaches to the
 
01:16:29.470 --> 01:16:29.480 align:start position:0%
mother's uterus wall in 17 days the
 
01:16:33.030 --> 01:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
blood cells develop in 19 days the eyes
 
01:16:35.590 --> 01:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
start develop and in 20 days the
 
01:16:38.430 --> 01:16:38.440 align:start position:0%
foundation of the nervous system is laid
 
01:16:41.030 --> 01:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
and just one more there's a lot more but
 
01:16:44.270 --> 01:16:44.280 align:start position:0%
between 18 and 21 days the heart begins
 
01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:48.070 align:start position:0%
between 18 and 21 days the heart begins
to

01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:52.550 --> 01:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
beat science may I just say um in
 
01:16:57.030 --> 01:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
closing in closing three minutes so okay
 
01:16:58.990 --> 01:16:59.000 align:start position:0%
in closing the ultrasound is a wonderful
 
01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
way to show the mother to be what a gift
 
01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
she has been given by God I pray that
 
01:17:06.110 --> 01:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
you all make the decision to protect and
 
01:17:08.709 --> 01:17:08.719 align:start position:0%
be the voice of the unbo and child thank
 
01:17:10.709 --> 01:17:10.719 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you for your
 
01:17:10.719 --> 01:17:13.229 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you for your
testimony

01:17:13.229 --> 01:17:13.239 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:17:16.229 --> 01:17:16.239 align:start position:0%
today and the next speaker would be oh
 
01:17:19.990 --> 01:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:22.709 --> 01:17:22.719 align:start position:0%
Sher seeing none the next speaker would
 
01:17:22.719 --> 01:17:27.270 align:start position:0%
Sher seeing none the next speaker would
be

01:17:27.270 --> 01:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:32.590 --> 01:17:32.600 align:start position:0%
Pi hello can you hear me you can okay uh

hi my name is Dr Dana Pierce and I live
 
01:17:38.590 --> 01:17:38.600 align:start position:0%
in Yarmouth Maine so yes my story is
 
01:17:40.830 --> 01:17:40.840 align:start position:0%
that of a mayor but if these abortion P
 
01:17:42.950 --> 01:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
banss are passed in New Hampshire my
 
01:17:45.070 --> 01:17:45.080 align:start position:0%
story could easily be that of any
 
01:17:47.669 --> 01:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
Granite State woman complications and
 
01:17:50.910 --> 01:17:50.920 align:start position:0%
pregnancies don't stop at Borders I am a
 
01:17:53.070 --> 01:17:53.080 align:start position:0%
wife a mother of two living children and
 
01:17:55.629 --> 01:17:55.639 align:start position:0%
a veterinarian I'm a Morehead Kane
 
01:17:58.070 --> 01:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
scholar and a world champion rower but I
 
01:17:59.830 --> 01:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
am also someone who has had an abortion
 
01:18:04.350 --> 01:18:04.360 align:start position:0%
later in pregnancy on January 25th 2019
 
01:18:07.189 --> 01:18:07.199 align:start position:0%
I was 32 weeks pregnant with my son
 
01:18:09.669 --> 01:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
Cameron that morning my husband and I
 
01:18:11.189 --> 01:18:11.199 align:start position:0%
along with our three-year-old daughter
 
01:18:13.350 --> 01:18:13.360 align:start position:0%
went to what we expected to be a routine
 
01:18:16.430 --> 01:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
ultrasound in a normal pregnancy but
 
01:18:18.070 --> 01:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
that's when we found out that Cameron
 
01:18:20.470 --> 01:18:20.480 align:start position:0%
had lethal skeletal dysplasia the result
 
01:18:24.229 --> 01:18:24.239 align:start position:0%
of a random denovo or new rare genetic
 
01:18:26.709 --> 01:18:26.719 align:start position:0%
mutation that occurs during sper sperm
 
01:18:28.870 --> 01:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
development and it's lethal because
 
01:18:30.590 --> 01:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
babies with this condition cannot
 
01:18:33.189 --> 01:18:33.199 align:start position:0%
breathe outside the womb their rib cages
 
01:18:36.110 --> 01:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
are too small Cameron's femur was also
 
01:18:37.910 --> 01:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
broken and there was evidence of
 
01:18:39.510 --> 01:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
multiple other healed
 
01:18:42.750 --> 01:18:42.760 align:start position:0%
fractures in short Cameron was actively
 
01:18:45.510 --> 01:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
suffering and faced death by Suffocation
 
01:18:47.390 --> 01:18:47.400 align:start position:0%
if he managed to make it to turn and
 
01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:48.709 align:start position:0%
if he managed to make it to turn and
survive

01:18:48.709 --> 01:18:48.719 align:start position:0%
survive
 
01:18:51.550 --> 01:18:51.560 align:start position:0%
delivery I still cannot really put into
 
01:18:54.229 --> 01:18:54.239 align:start position:0%
words the int intensity of Anguish and
 
01:18:56.350 --> 01:18:56.360 align:start position:0%
grief that my husband and I felt in
 
01:18:58.229 --> 01:18:58.239 align:start position:0%
those moments and in the days and weeks
 
01:19:00.950 --> 01:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
that followed but I must strongly
 
01:19:03.790 --> 01:19:03.800 align:start position:0%
emphasize that my thoughts were that I
 
01:19:05.790 --> 01:19:05.800 align:start position:0%
would not let my son suffer any longer
 
01:19:09.310 --> 01:19:09.320 align:start position:0%
than he already had unfortunately our
 
01:19:11.430 --> 01:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
grief was then com compounded by the
 
01:19:13.830 --> 01:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
limits on abortion light rights in Maine
 
01:19:16.229 --> 01:19:16.239 align:start position:0%
and in our country those restrictions
 
01:19:18.189 --> 01:19:18.199 align:start position:0%
meant that we had to fly across the
 
01:19:21.830 --> 01:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
country and pay $25,000 in cash in order
 
01:19:23.350 --> 01:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
to end our son's suffer
 
01:19:26.030 --> 01:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
uing and while I was incredibly
 
01:19:28.070 --> 01:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
fortunate to be able to afford the cost
 
01:19:32.030 --> 01:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
of travel missed work lodging and the
 
01:19:34.110 --> 01:19:34.120 align:start position:0%
fee for the abortion itself the majority
 
01:19:36.270 --> 01:19:36.280 align:start position:0%
of women in my situation in this country
 
01:19:39.390 --> 01:19:39.400 align:start position:0%
would not have been so lucky bands and
 
01:19:41.310 --> 01:19:41.320 align:start position:0%
limits on abortion later in pregnancy
 
01:19:43.910 --> 01:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
add exponentially to Mother's grief and
 
01:19:46.229 --> 01:19:46.239 align:start position:0%
suffering we should instead be making
 
01:19:48.110 --> 01:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
laws to ensure that women facing
 
01:19:51.310 --> 01:19:51.320 align:start position:0%
situations like mine are guaranteed safe
 
01:19:54.229 --> 01:19:54.239 align:start position:0%
Compassionate Care and support
 
01:19:56.470 --> 01:19:56.480 align:start position:0%
abortion for any reason is a deeply
 
01:19:58.350 --> 01:19:58.360 align:start position:0%
personal decision and should not have
 
01:20:00.310 --> 01:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
anyone involved other than the pregnant
 
01:20:02.790 --> 01:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
woman her medical team and any others
 
01:20:05.270 --> 01:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
that she chooses to advise her please
 
01:20:07.750 --> 01:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
join me in trusting and empowering women
 
01:20:10.070 --> 01:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
to make ethical loving decisions for
 
01:20:12.830 --> 01:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
their own bodies and families please
 
01:20:16.790 --> 01:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
oppose House Bill 622 and House Bill 625
 
01:20:19.070 --> 01:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
thank you I have submitted this
 
01:20:21.709 --> 01:20:21.719 align:start position:0%
testimony in writing uh a more complete
 
01:20:23.510 --> 01:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
version but I'm happy to answer any
 
01:20:25.950 --> 01:20:25.960 align:start position:0%
questions now thank you for your
 
01:20:27.990 --> 01:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
testimony are there any questions for
 
01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:31.110 align:start position:0%
testimony are there any questions for
Miss

01:20:31.110 --> 01:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:34.189 --> 01:20:34.199 align:start position:0%
Pierce seeing that again thank you for
 
01:20:36.229 --> 01:20:36.239 align:start position:0%
your testimony today thank you for
 
01:20:36.239 --> 01:20:37.590 align:start position:0%
your testimony today thank you for
having

01:20:37.590 --> 01:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
having
 
01:20:41.870 --> 01:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
me I think at at this point in time uh
 
01:20:45.430 --> 01:20:45.440 align:start position:0%
it it's 10:22 I guess give everybody a
 
01:20:47.950 --> 01:20:47.960 align:start position:0%
10 10 minute break why don't we take a
 
01:20:50.590 --> 01:20:50.600 align:start position:0%
10-minute break and so that everybody
 
01:20:52.750 --> 01:20:52.760 align:start position:0%
have a chance for a short break and
 
01:20:54.830 --> 01:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
we'll come back and finish the testimony
 
01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:56.229 align:start position:0%
we'll come back and finish the testimony
this

01:20:56.229 --> 01:20:56.239 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:21:11.550 --> 01:21:11.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:14.149 --> 01:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
you who can I
 
01:21:17.550 --> 01:21:17.560 align:start position:0%
see so I would really like to have uh a
 
01:21:19.229 --> 01:21:19.239 align:start position:0%
list of the
 
01:21:21.750 --> 01:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
speakers that you have I know in front
 
01:21:23.510 --> 01:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
of you with their name
 
01:21:25.510 --> 01:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
appropriately spelled
 
01:21:28.390 --> 01:21:28.400 align:start position:0%
Etc so that I can uh fix this up in the
 
01:21:30.390 --> 01:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
minutes I mean it's really difficult for
 
01:21:32.390 --> 01:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
me to figure out I mean Dana Pierce
 
01:21:36.709 --> 01:21:36.719 align:start position:0%
wasn't too hard I I think uh we'll ask
 
01:21:41.070 --> 01:21:41.080 align:start position:0%
Gen 4 to send you a list of the
 
01:21:43.229 --> 01:21:43.239 align:start position:0%
speakers that would be very helpful
 
01:21:45.830 --> 01:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
thank you I have a related I have a
 
01:21:48.950 --> 01:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
related question um many people refer to
 
01:21:50.470 --> 01:21:50.480 align:start position:0%
written testimony and of course I'm
 
01:21:53.189 --> 01:21:53.199 align:start position:0%
drowning in emails so who
 
01:21:55.510 --> 01:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
is it uh represent Ware is it Jen or who
 
01:21:57.990 --> 01:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
who's going to be responsible for you
 
01:22:01.629 --> 01:22:01.639 align:start position:0%
know uh capturing all these uh emails I
 
01:22:02.709 --> 01:22:02.719 align:start position:0%
guess most of them being sent to the
 
01:22:04.110 --> 01:22:04.120 align:start position:0%
house Judiciary account but I don't know
 
01:22:05.750 --> 01:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
if anybody gets that inside the actual
 
01:22:07.709 --> 01:22:07.719 align:start position:0%
members of the committee like how do we
 
01:22:09.629 --> 01:22:09.639 align:start position:0%
who whose job is going to be to like
 
01:22:11.470 --> 01:22:11.480 align:start position:0%
actually determine what goes in which
 
01:22:13.669 --> 01:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
Bill file and then hopefully make the
 
01:22:15.669 --> 01:22:15.679 align:start position:0%
bill files available at some point so
 
01:22:18.189 --> 01:22:18.199 align:start position:0%
people can review them so they put on
 
01:22:19.990 --> 01:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
the thing whether they want it to be in
 
01:22:21.990 --> 01:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
the record and that well they do and
 
01:22:23.510 --> 01:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
they don't
 
01:22:25.830 --> 01:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
well they're supposed to so if they do
 
01:22:28.390 --> 01:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
and it goes to the email address that is
 
01:22:31.149 --> 01:22:31.159 align:start position:0%
on the link to sign up then that goes to
 
01:22:33.149 --> 01:22:33.159 align:start position:0%
house committee Services too and they
 
01:22:36.750 --> 01:22:36.760 align:start position:0%
put it in the record so so you're right
 
01:22:39.070 --> 01:22:39.080 align:start position:0%
kimoy that for those people that put
 
01:22:41.189 --> 01:22:41.199 align:start position:0%
those the magic words I guess I want to
 
01:22:44.350 --> 01:22:44.360 align:start position:0%
put it into their uh Communications with
 
01:22:45.870 --> 01:22:45.880 align:start position:0%
the committee I didn't realize there
 
01:22:47.510 --> 01:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
were two of us looking at that so that's
 
01:22:49.950 --> 01:22:49.960 align:start position:0%
good yeah but I I will tell you right
 
01:22:52.870 --> 01:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
now that um I have done my best to
 
01:22:54.830 --> 01:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
identify keep them
 
01:22:57.709 --> 01:22:57.719 align:start position:0%
all right if the people submit a longw
 
01:22:59.950 --> 01:22:59.960 align:start position:0%
written testimony then most often I make
 
01:23:02.550 --> 01:23:02.560 align:start position:0%
separate files for them where often I do
 
01:23:04.629 --> 01:23:04.639 align:start position:0%
but often I don't and I have a single
 
01:23:06.950 --> 01:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
file right now that's 18 pages long I
 
01:23:09.390 --> 01:23:09.400 align:start position:0%
have over a 100 emails still to deal
 
01:23:12.910 --> 01:23:12.920 align:start position:0%
with for these bills well all these Pro
 
01:23:15.990 --> 01:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
lifee bills I'm just asking I submitted
 
01:23:17.550 --> 01:23:17.560 align:start position:0%
testimony a number of bills like there's
 
01:23:18.950 --> 01:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
one today that I submitt a written
 
01:23:21.669 --> 01:23:21.679 align:start position:0%
testimony for just want to make sure the
 
01:23:23.709 --> 01:23:23.719 align:start position:0%
bill file so people can take a look at
 
01:23:25.189 --> 01:23:25.199 align:start position:0%
it later because these Bill files too
 
01:23:27.149 --> 01:23:27.159 align:start position:0%
are also going to become a lot more
 
01:23:29.110 --> 01:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
available because of the changes we made
 
01:23:31.990 --> 01:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
last summer so before everything was in
 
01:23:34.709 --> 01:23:34.719 align:start position:0%
this files will be a a judici Nancy Cass
 
01:23:36.030 --> 01:23:36.040 align:start position:0%
set's desk and then it would wander up
 
01:23:38.310 --> 01:23:38.320 align:start position:0%
to the fourth floor and like really for
 
01:23:39.990 --> 01:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
a couple of years they weren't really
 
01:23:41.709 --> 01:23:41.719 align:start position:0%
easily accessible to anyone unless you
 
01:23:43.910 --> 01:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
actually knew like who to go find at the
 
01:23:45.590 --> 01:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
lob at asked whereas now these things
 
01:23:47.990 --> 01:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
are going to be probably online more
 
01:23:50.629 --> 01:23:50.639 align:start position:0%
quickly so going to be a little bit more
 
01:23:52.149 --> 01:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
so some of that's at the Judgment of the
 
01:23:52.159 --> 01:23:54.189 align:start position:0%
so some of that's at the Judgment of the
Court

01:23:54.189 --> 01:23:54.199 align:start position:0%
Court
 
01:23:57.669 --> 01:23:57.679 align:start position:0%
yeah and some of it is more or less set
 
01:23:59.590 --> 01:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
in practice where people ask to be part
 
01:24:01.229 --> 01:24:01.239 align:start position:0%
of the permanent record or actually
 
01:24:04.310 --> 01:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
testify okay so he should actually like
 
01:24:06.070 --> 01:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
say the magic words if they can to make
 
01:24:07.870 --> 01:24:07.880 align:start position:0%
sure it's preserved I don't
 
01:24:10.870 --> 01:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
think I I got letter from HCS because
 
01:24:12.790 --> 01:24:12.800 align:start position:0%
I've been just copying all my emails
 
01:24:14.750 --> 01:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
through various committees just because
 
01:24:16.110 --> 01:24:16.120 align:start position:0%
I had that concern like I don't really
 
01:24:18.470 --> 01:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
know what the clerk going to do or like
 
01:24:20.270 --> 01:24:20.280 align:start position:0%
who else is doing
 
01:24:23.830 --> 01:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
it anyway well thanks myself right now I
 
01:24:25.070 --> 01:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
don't know what the Court's going to do
 
01:24:26.910 --> 01:24:26.920 align:start position:0%
either because I thought I could handle
 
01:24:28.510 --> 01:24:28.520 align:start position:0%
this if we'd only get a hundred or so
 
01:24:31.070 --> 01:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
emails but right now I have I think it's
 
01:24:34.229 --> 01:24:34.239 align:start position:0%
three screens full yeah of emails to
 
01:24:36.510 --> 01:24:36.520 align:start position:0%
deal with and and most of the people who
 
01:24:38.709 --> 01:24:38.719 align:start position:0%
testified have already dealt with there
 
01:24:40.950 --> 01:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
yeah thanks yeah it's a terrible it's a
 
01:24:44.390 --> 01:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
thankless job and so anyway we'll see
 
01:24:51.350 --> 01:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:53.109 align:start position:0%
 
minutes

01:24:53.109 --> 01:24:53.119 align:start position:0%

up can you hear me better now yes all
 
01:34:22.910 --> 01:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
right okay um thank you Mr chairman and
 
01:34:24.229 --> 01:34:24.239 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for dating my
 
01:34:27.390 --> 01:34:27.400 align:start position:0%
testimony today my name is Sophia Biondo
 
01:34:29.550 --> 01:34:29.560 align:start position:0%
I'm 14 I live in Manchester and I'm
 
01:34:30.990 --> 01:34:31.000 align:start position:0%
speaking today on behalf of the New
 
01:34:32.470 --> 01:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire High School Democrats in
 
01:34:34.470 --> 01:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
opposition to HB
 
01:34:36.709 --> 01:34:36.719 align:start position:0%
625 before I start I would like to state
 
01:34:38.390 --> 01:34:38.400 align:start position:0%
that this testimony has been shortened
 
01:34:40.030 --> 01:34:40.040 align:start position:0%
in the interest of time um but a longer
 
01:34:41.229 --> 01:34:41.239 align:start position:0%
version should have been emailed to the
 
01:34:42.990 --> 01:34:43.000 align:start position:0%
committee which contains more
 
01:34:45.669 --> 01:34:45.679 align:start position:0%
information um that said the nhhs is
 
01:34:48.109 --> 01:34:48.119 align:start position:0%
opposed to HB 625 because this bill not
 
01:34:49.790 --> 01:34:49.800 align:start position:0%
only fundamentally violates women's
 
01:34:51.270 --> 01:34:51.280 align:start position:0%
reproductive freedom and autonomy but
 
01:34:52.669 --> 01:34:52.679 align:start position:0%
also Al harms Women's Health directly
 
01:34:53.910 --> 01:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
and adds unnecessary stress to
 
01:34:56.510 --> 01:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
healthcare providers First of all only
 
01:34:58.350 --> 01:34:58.360 align:start position:0%
slightly more than 1% of abortions are
 
01:35:00.229 --> 01:35:00.239 align:start position:0%
performed at 21 weeks or later there are
 
01:35:01.750 --> 01:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
several reasons why women obtain later
 
01:35:03.189 --> 01:35:03.199 align:start position:0%
abortions that range from difficulties
 
01:35:05.149 --> 01:35:05.159 align:start position:0%
finding a provider raising money for the
 
01:35:06.750 --> 01:35:06.760 align:start position:0%
procedure and transportation costs
 
01:35:08.149 --> 01:35:08.159 align:start position:0%
obtaining health insurance coverage to
 
01:35:09.430 --> 01:35:09.440 align:start position:0%
health complications and fetal
 
01:35:11.669 --> 01:35:11.679 align:start position:0%
abnormalities that are diagnosed late in
 
01:35:13.590 --> 01:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
pregnancy this bill would only add
 
01:35:14.910 --> 01:35:14.920 align:start position:0%
further delay and make it harder for
 
01:35:16.189 --> 01:35:16.199 align:start position:0%
women to get in abortion when they need
 
01:35:18.830 --> 01:35:18.840 align:start position:0%
to using gational age as a legal cut off
 
01:35:21.030 --> 01:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
for abortion care is also problematic
 
01:35:22.750 --> 01:35:22.760 align:start position:0%
babies are rarely delivered on schedule
 
01:35:24.229 --> 01:35:24.239 align:start position:0%
and viability should be determined on a
 
01:35:26.709 --> 01:35:26.719 align:start position:0%
case-by Case basic by medical case-by
 
01:35:28.510 --> 01:35:28.520 align:start position:0%
case basis by medical professionals and
 
01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:29.310 align:start position:0%
case basis by medical professionals and
not

01:35:29.310 --> 01:35:29.320 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:35:31.430 --> 01:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
politicians the bill also cites that a
 
01:35:33.270 --> 01:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
fetus is able to feel pain by 20 weeks
 
01:35:34.510 --> 01:35:34.520 align:start position:0%
but that is a highly controversial
 
01:35:36.629 --> 01:35:36.639 align:start position:0%
subject within the medical field in fact
 
01:35:38.070 --> 01:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
several Studies have shown that a fetus
 
01:35:39.669 --> 01:35:39.679 align:start position:0%
only develops the corticol function
 
01:35:41.189 --> 01:35:41.199 align:start position:0%
required for perception of pain around
 
01:35:43.550 --> 01:35:43.560 align:start position:0%
29 to 30 weeks of pregnancy flinching
 
01:35:44.830 --> 01:35:44.840 align:start position:0%
back from a stimulus actually does not
 
01:35:46.510 --> 01:35:46.520 align:start position:0%
mean that a fetus feels pain as a same
 
01:35:50.070 --> 01:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:52.669 --> 01:35:52.679 align:start position:0%
non but the anesthetics and Fetal
 
01:35:53.950 --> 01:35:53.960 align:start position:0%
surgery is actually for the purpose of
 
01:35:54.990 --> 01:35:55.000 align:start position:0%
reducing movement and preventing
 
01:35:57.510 --> 01:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
hormonal responses not to stop pain thus
 
01:35:59.189 --> 01:35:59.199 align:start position:0%
the claim that a fetus fetus would feel
 
01:36:00.910 --> 01:36:00.920 align:start position:0%
pain after 20 weeks is unproven and
 
01:36:02.470 --> 01:36:02.480 align:start position:0%
cannot be used to promote the
 
01:36:04.750 --> 01:36:04.760 align:start position:0%
bill furthermore there's an overwhelming
 
01:36:05.990 --> 01:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
amount of evidence that the vast
 
01:36:08.149 --> 01:36:08.159 align:start position:0%
majority of women do not regret having
 
01:36:10.030 --> 01:36:10.040 align:start position:0%
abortions on the contrary The Landmark
 
01:36:11.550 --> 01:36:11.560 align:start position:0%
turnaway study says that women who were
 
01:36:13.629 --> 01:36:13.639 align:start position:0%
denied abortions experience experienced
 
01:36:15.109 --> 01:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
a wide range of detrimental effects on
 
01:36:17.149 --> 01:36:17.159 align:start position:0%
their well-being they reported lower
 
01:36:19.189 --> 01:36:19.199 align:start position:0%
self-esteem higher anxiety and ongoing
 
01:36:20.910 --> 01:36:20.920 align:start position:0%
exposure to intimate partner violence as
 
01:36:22.109 --> 01:36:22.119 align:start position:0%
well as being being more likely to
 
01:36:23.510 --> 01:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
experience serious complications
 
01:36:24.870 --> 01:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
associated with the later stages of
 
01:36:27.709 --> 01:36:27.719 align:start position:0%
pregnancy such as eclampsia and death
 
01:36:29.030 --> 01:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
women who were denied abortion also
 
01:36:30.470 --> 01:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
experience poor maternal bonding with
 
01:36:32.669 --> 01:36:32.679 align:start position:0%
their new children moreover women who
 
01:36:34.669 --> 01:36:34.679 align:start position:0%
were denied abortion care have a higher
 
01:36:36.189 --> 01:36:36.199 align:start position:0%
rate of unemployment and are more likely
 
01:36:37.830 --> 01:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
to be impoverished even years after the
 
01:36:39.590 --> 01:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
pregnancy this is why women in
 
01:36:40.990 --> 01:36:41.000 align:start position:0%
low-income communities and women of
 
01:36:42.430 --> 01:36:42.440 align:start position:0%
color would be so disproportionately
 
01:36:43.870 --> 01:36:43.880 align:start position:0%
affected by this bill as the economic
 
01:36:46.189 --> 01:36:46.199 align:start position:0%
pressures are strongest for them the
 
01:36:47.910 --> 01:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
Bill's definition of medical emergencies
 
01:36:49.510 --> 01:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
is also incredibly narrow it does not
 
01:36:50.870 --> 01:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
take into account circumstances like
 
01:36:52.550 --> 01:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
rape and incest and fetal abnormalities
 
01:36:54.350 --> 01:36:54.360 align:start position:0%
diagnosed late in pregnancy that will be
 
01:36:55.910 --> 01:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
factored into this decision and it says
 
01:36:57.830 --> 01:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
nothing of psychological Health the
 
01:36:59.270 --> 01:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
effect on women's health goes far beyond
 
01:37:01.310 --> 01:37:01.320 align:start position:0%
what is defined in this bill requiring
 
01:37:02.990 --> 01:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
providers to report abortions also adds
 
01:37:04.510 --> 01:37:04.520 align:start position:0%
unnecessary stress to the provider who
 
01:37:05.790 --> 01:37:05.800 align:start position:0%
should only be concerned with the best
 
01:37:07.669 --> 01:37:07.679 align:start position:0%
interest of the patient having these
 
01:37:09.229 --> 01:37:09.239 align:start position:0%
decisions under scrutiny by a third
 
01:37:10.950 --> 01:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
party would add additional pressure onto
 
01:37:12.790 --> 01:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
the provider without any medical benefit
 
01:37:14.790 --> 01:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
to the patient in conclusion the
 
01:37:16.430 --> 01:37:16.440 align:start position:0%
evidence is abundant that denying late
 
01:37:17.669 --> 01:37:17.679 align:start position:0%
abortion care can be incredibly
 
01:37:19.109 --> 01:37:19.119 align:start position:0%
dangerous and detrimental to a woman's
 
01:37:20.470 --> 01:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
health and we need to give women
 
01:37:22.149 --> 01:37:22.159 align:start position:0%
autonomy over their bodies and Leal
 
01:37:23.470 --> 01:37:23.480 align:start position:0%
decisions to be between them and their
 
01:37:25.550 --> 01:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
medical providers therefore I urge the
 
01:37:28.910 --> 01:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
committee to vote against HB
 
01:37:31.430 --> 01:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
68 thank you for your testimony are
 
01:37:35.550 --> 01:37:35.560 align:start position:0%

questions seeing none again thank you
 
01:37:39.950 --> 01:37:39.960 align:start position:0%
again for your testimony
 
01:37:43.510 --> 01:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
today the next p person to speak will be
 
01:37:50.189 --> 01:37:50.199 align:start position:0%

I support HB 625 the fetal Life
 
01:38:11.149 --> 01:38:11.159 align:start position:0%
protection act this bill furthers New
 
01:38:12.589 --> 01:38:12.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's legitimate interest in
 
01:38:14.430 --> 01:38:14.440 align:start position:0%
protecting maternal Health preventing
 
01:38:17.830 --> 01:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
fetal pain and affirming life HB 625
 
01:38:20.430 --> 01:38:20.440 align:start position:0%
sets a clear standard for providers
 
01:38:22.550 --> 01:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
First later term abortions carry high
 
01:38:25.070 --> 01:38:25.080 align:start position:0%
risks we know now what the justices did
 
01:38:26.390 --> 01:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
not know in
 
01:38:29.910 --> 01:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
1973 abortion harms women and that risk
 
01:38:31.910 --> 01:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
increases substantially with gestational
 
01:38:34.390 --> 01:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
age that's the strongest risk factor for
 
01:38:36.270 --> 01:38:36.280 align:start position:0%
abortion related mortality a woman
 
01:38:38.750 --> 01:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
seeking an abortion at 20 weeks is 35
 
01:38:40.790 --> 01:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
times more likely to die than in the
 
01:38:43.270 --> 01:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
first trimester at 21 weeks or more she
 
01:38:46.910 --> 01:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
is 91 times more likely to die later
 
01:38:48.669 --> 01:38:48.679 align:start position:0%
abortions also pose a significantly
 
01:38:50.589 --> 01:38:50.599 align:start position:0%
increased risk for maternal Health
 
01:38:52.830 --> 01:38:52.840 align:start position:0%
immediate complications affect 10% of
 
01:38:54.910 --> 01:38:54.920 align:start position:0%
women undergoing abortion and include
 
01:38:57.149 --> 01:38:57.159 align:start position:0%
blood clots Hemorrhage incomplete
 
01:38:59.350 --> 01:38:59.360 align:start position:0%
abortions infection and injury to the
 
01:39:01.990 --> 01:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
cervix and other organs 20% of these
 
01:39:04.109 --> 01:39:04.119 align:start position:0%
complications are life-threatening
 
01:39:05.950 --> 01:39:05.960 align:start position:0%
abortion industry studies show most

representative Horgan did you have a
 
01:41:10.790 --> 01:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
question uh yes yes thank you very much
 
01:41:13.470 --> 01:41:13.480 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you very much M Glenn
 
01:41:16.430 --> 01:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
Foster I just wondering are you speaking
 
01:41:18.629 --> 01:41:18.639 align:start position:0%
simply as a supporter of these two bills
 
01:41:20.390 --> 01:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
the head of organization that supports
 
01:41:22.629 --> 01:41:22.639 align:start position:0%
more you or your organization have any
 
01:41:25.430 --> 01:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
role in uh crafting either of these two
 
01:41:27.189 --> 01:41:27.199 align:start position:0%
pieces of legislation and are they
 
01:41:29.950 --> 01:41:29.960 align:start position:0%
similar to any sample legislation that
 
01:41:31.790 --> 01:41:31.800 align:start position:0%
you may have disseminated to supporters
 
01:41:35.109 --> 01:41:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:38.430 --> 01:41:38.440 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you for your question um
 
01:41:41.030 --> 01:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
yes so I am speaking in support of HB
 
01:41:43.470 --> 01:41:43.480 align:start position:0%
625 we did not have a role in crafting
 
01:41:43.480 --> 01:41:44.229 align:start position:0%
625 we did not have a role in crafting
this

01:41:44.229 --> 01:41:44.239 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:41:46.390 --> 01:41:46.400 align:start position:0%
legislation okay and what about you
 
01:41:49.709 --> 01:41:49.719 align:start position:0%
support HB 622 or what's your no no no
 
01:41:52.669 --> 01:41:52.679 align:start position:0%
I'm here to support HB 625 okay not the
 
01:41:54.790 --> 01:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
other one
 
01:41:54.800 --> 01:41:59.070 align:start position:0%
other one
thanks

01:41:59.070 --> 01:41:59.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:00.830 --> 01:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
representative hi thank you for your
 
01:42:03.990 --> 01:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
testimony Attorney Glenn Foster I am uh
 
01:42:05.510 --> 01:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
wondering if you practice in New
 
01:42:07.750 --> 01:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh and if not um in what state
 
01:42:07.760 --> 01:42:08.709 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh and if not um in what state
you

01:42:08.709 --> 01:42:08.719 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:42:10.990 --> 01:42:11.000 align:start position:0%
practice yes I'm licensed to practice
 
01:42:13.830 --> 01:42:13.840 align:start position:0%
law in Virginia and DC as well as um
 
01:42:16.310 --> 01:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
certain federal courts and part of the
 
01:42:18.589 --> 01:42:18.599 align:start position:0%
role of my organization is to compare
 
01:42:20.550 --> 01:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
the laws in different states when it
 
01:42:23.709 --> 01:42:23.719 align:start position:0%
comes to bioethical issues and so we um
 
01:42:26.030 --> 01:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
we often come to testify on the
 
01:42:28.030 --> 01:42:28.040 align:start position:0%
different states and what the the
 
01:42:30.109 --> 01:42:30.119 align:start position:0%
different bills are and the different
 
01:42:32.470 --> 01:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
laws are in States Across the Nation so
 
01:42:35.030 --> 01:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
that state legislators and lawmakers can
 
01:42:37.550 --> 01:42:37.560 align:start position:0%
compare uh how their state would um
 
01:42:40.950 --> 01:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
would compare to other states
 
01:42:45.189 --> 01:42:45.199 align:start position:0%
Nationwide thank you any other questions
 
01:42:48.870 --> 01:42:48.880 align:start position:0%
over here yes representative mlan yes
 
01:42:51.109 --> 01:42:51.119 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and and thank you for
 
01:42:53.270 --> 01:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question so you mentioned that
 
01:42:56.189 --> 01:42:56.199 align:start position:0%
the bill is constitutional and that um
 
01:42:58.709 --> 01:42:58.719 align:start position:0%
It lines up the 24 weeks lines up with
 
01:43:01.790 --> 01:43:01.800 align:start position:0%
bills in many other states um we heard
 
01:43:03.589 --> 01:43:03.599 align:start position:0%
about Minnesota and Maine could you tell
 
01:43:06.270 --> 01:43:06.280 align:start position:0%
us some of these other states and has it
 
01:43:08.149 --> 01:43:08.159 align:start position:0%
been tested in the courts in any of
 
01:43:09.229 --> 01:43:09.239 align:start position:0%
those other
 
01:43:13.030 --> 01:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
states yes so at least 24 states do have
 
01:43:15.430 --> 01:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
an enforceable limitation which means
 
01:43:18.669 --> 01:43:18.679 align:start position:0%
that uh that it has not been overturned
 
01:43:21.070 --> 01:43:21.080 align:start position:0%
or uh or in any way mooded in those
 
01:43:23.109 --> 01:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
other states um if you're interested I
 
01:43:25.629 --> 01:43:25.639 align:start position:0%
can get you a list of all of those
 
01:43:27.870 --> 01:43:27.880 align:start position:0%
States I can send that over to the
 
01:43:29.950 --> 01:43:29.960 align:start position:0%
committee I would appreciate that very
 
01:43:32.390 --> 01:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
much thank you certainly
 
01:43:34.390 --> 01:43:34.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely and they are in fact listed
 
01:43:36.229 --> 01:43:36.239 align:start position:0%
in my written testimony as well but I
 
01:43:39.109 --> 01:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
can send it again if that would be
 
01:43:41.990 --> 01:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
helpful that would be helpful thank you
 
01:43:44.149 --> 01:43:44.159 align:start position:0%
any other
 
01:43:46.669 --> 01:43:46.679 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none again thank you
 
01:43:49.669 --> 01:43:49.679 align:start position:0%
for your testimony today thank
 
01:43:49.679 --> 01:43:51.589 align:start position:0%
for your testimony today thank
you

01:43:51.589 --> 01:43:51.599 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:43:54.310 --> 01:43:54.320 align:start position:0%
would be Michael

King is Michael King
 
01:44:01.430 --> 01:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
available I don't see a hand up for
 
01:44:01.440 --> 01:44:11.750 align:start position:0%
available I don't see a hand up for
Michael

01:44:11.750 --> 01:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:14.109 --> 01:44:14.119 align:start position:0%
King uh Mr chair there was a
 
01:44:15.990 --> 01:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Family Institute that
 
01:44:17.430 --> 01:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
lowered their hand and raised it again
 
01:44:25.830 --> 01:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:27.109 --> 01:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
you want me
 
01:44:30.350 --> 01:44:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:32.830 --> 01:44:32.840 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you my name is uh Michael
 
01:44:35.270 --> 01:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
King and I'm actually speaking as a
 
01:44:39.070 --> 01:44:39.080 align:start position:0%
resident of New Hampshire um I recently
 
01:44:42.270 --> 01:44:42.280 align:start position:0%
moved from Massachusetts uh to New
 
01:44:44.189 --> 01:44:44.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh thinking that I would be
 
01:44:47.070 --> 01:44:47.080 align:start position:0%
moving into a state that had um you know
 
01:44:49.629 --> 01:44:49.639 align:start position:0%
more conservative laws especially when
 
01:44:51.950 --> 01:44:51.960 align:start position:0%
it comes to the sanct city of Life uh to
 
01:44:53.470 --> 01:44:53.480 align:start position:0%
find out that for far too long New
 
01:44:56.070 --> 01:44:56.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has been one of the only a few
 
01:44:58.149 --> 01:44:58.159 align:start position:0%
US states that provides virtually no
 
01:45:00.830 --> 01:45:00.840 align:start position:0%
protection for unborn children uh we are
 
01:45:02.270 --> 01:45:02.280 align:start position:0%
even barred from knowing how many
 
01:45:04.750 --> 01:45:04.760 align:start position:0%
abortions occur in the state and
 
01:45:06.550 --> 01:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
currently abortions are legal
 
01:45:08.950 --> 01:45:08.960 align:start position:0%
unrestricted and unregulated throughout
 
01:45:10.350 --> 01:45:10.360 align:start position:0%
40 weeks of
 
01:45:12.550 --> 01:45:12.560 align:start position:0%
pregnancy um I've already submitted my
 
01:45:14.870 --> 01:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
testimony to the judicial committee uh
 
01:45:17.109 --> 01:45:17.119 align:start position:0%
but I really just want to make one
 
01:45:20.070 --> 01:45:20.080 align:start position:0%
simple Point um the only restriction New
 
01:45:22.390 --> 01:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire places on abortions is
 
01:45:25.070 --> 01:45:25.080 align:start position:0%
prohibiting a single procedure uh which
 
01:45:27.629 --> 01:45:27.639 align:start position:0%
is a partial birth abortion where a
 
01:45:29.430 --> 01:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
living child is partially delivered
 
01:45:32.830 --> 01:45:32.840 align:start position:0%
before being uh eliminated but this
 
01:45:35.709 --> 01:45:35.719 align:start position:0%
arbitrary law only bans one specific
 
01:45:38.589 --> 01:45:38.599 align:start position:0%
procedure so viable infants may still be
 
01:45:41.709 --> 01:45:41.719 align:start position:0%
legally aborted at any time using other
 
01:45:43.470 --> 01:45:43.480 align:start position:0%
procedures such as dismembering the
 
01:45:46.270 --> 01:45:46.280 align:start position:0%
infant in the womb and REM removing them
 
01:45:49.390 --> 01:45:49.400 align:start position:0%
piece by piece so to change that we must
 
01:45:51.109 --> 01:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
act by passing
 
01:45:54.030 --> 01:45:54.040 align:start position:0%
HB 625 so I just want to make that clear
 
01:45:57.270 --> 01:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
that if we have a partial birth abortion
 
01:46:00.629 --> 01:46:00.639 align:start position:0%
where the baby comes out alive then that
 
01:46:03.109 --> 01:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
baby is as I understand it protected in
 
01:46:06.149 --> 01:46:06.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but if we dismember the
 
01:46:08.870 --> 01:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
baby while in utero there is no
 
01:46:12.070 --> 01:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
protection for that particular baby so
 
01:46:15.990 --> 01:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
clearly we need some improvement to the
 
01:46:19.189 --> 01:46:19.199 align:start position:0%
law and I hope uh you will consider that
 
01:46:22.790 --> 01:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
and vote in report of HB
 
01:46:25.950 --> 01:46:25.960 align:start position:0%
625 thank you for your testimony and are
 
01:46:30.149 --> 01:46:30.159 align:start position:0%

01:47:08.629 --> 01:47:08.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:13.950 --> 01:47:13.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:17.830 --> 01:47:17.840 align:start position:0%
there hello yes we can hear you okay
 
01:47:20.669 --> 01:47:20.679 align:start position:0%
thank you I would like to thank the
 
01:47:23.390 --> 01:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
chair and the Judiciary Committee
 
01:47:26.750 --> 01:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
members my name is Dr pet kiprop I'm a
 
01:47:30.350 --> 01:47:30.360 align:start position:0%
family medicine provider who also does
 
01:47:32.629 --> 01:47:32.639 align:start position:0%
obstetrics I've lived here in Hampshire
 
01:47:35.629 --> 01:47:35.639 align:start position:0%
and practice for the last 12
 
01:47:38.950 --> 01:47:38.960 align:start position:0%
years I would like to testify in support
 
01:47:40.390 --> 01:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
of HB
 
01:47:42.990 --> 01:47:43.000 align:start position:0%
625 I think this is a very reasonable
 
01:47:46.350 --> 01:47:46.360 align:start position:0%
bill in support of FAL life we know that
 
01:47:49.669 --> 01:47:49.679 align:start position:0%
after 24 weeks the survival rate of the
 
01:47:49.679 --> 01:47:51.430 align:start position:0%
after 24 weeks the survival rate of the
newborn

01:47:51.430 --> 01:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
newborn
 
01:47:54.030 --> 01:47:54.040 align:start position:0%
uh FS outside the womb of its mother is
 
01:47:57.229 --> 01:47:57.239 align:start position:0%
significantly high as compared to any
 
01:47:58.750 --> 01:47:58.760 align:start position:0%
time before that
 
01:48:02.149 --> 01:48:02.159 align:start position:0%
period hence I think the reason why we
 
01:48:03.750 --> 01:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
should support this
 
01:48:07.030 --> 01:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
bill I distinctively remember around 8
 
01:48:09.950 --> 01:48:09.960 align:start position:0%
years ago I was involved in a care of a
 
01:48:12.750 --> 01:48:12.760 align:start position:0%
patient who had to be delivered at 25
 
01:48:15.750 --> 01:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
weeks due to severe complications of her
 
01:48:18.350 --> 01:48:18.360 align:start position:0%
pregnancy a newborn baby girl was
 
01:48:21.510 --> 01:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
delivered who had to spent a long time
 
01:48:25.550 --> 01:48:25.560 align:start position:0%
in the neonatal Care Unit but eventually
 
01:48:28.350 --> 01:48:28.360 align:start position:0%
she got discharged from there and now
 
01:48:31.229 --> 01:48:31.239 align:start position:0%
she's thriving both academically and
 
01:48:34.510 --> 01:48:34.520 align:start position:0%
physic physically honorable members the
 
01:48:36.709 --> 01:48:36.719 align:start position:0%
lives of these children will depend on
 
01:48:40.149 --> 01:48:40.159 align:start position:0%
how you vote for this Bill thank you I

Dana pierce the mother from Maine who

testified earlier as as well as her son
 
01:49:53.229 --> 01:49:53.239 align:start position:0%
Cameron um my matron of honor in my
 
01:49:55.149 --> 01:49:55.159 align:start position:0%
wedding Lorraine had a daughter Cecilia
 
01:49:57.189 --> 01:49:57.199 align:start position:0%
with the same lethal skeletal mutation
 
01:49:59.550 --> 01:49:59.560 align:start position:0%
baby Cecilia's condition was diagnosed
 
01:50:02.790 --> 01:50:02.800 align:start position:0%
at the routine 20 weeks gational age 32
 
01:50:04.550 --> 01:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
weeks is not normally considered the
 
01:50:08.229 --> 01:50:08.239 align:start position:0%
gational age for a routine ultrasound
 
01:50:10.430 --> 01:50:10.440 align:start position:0%
baby Cecilia's father is actually the
 
01:50:12.629 --> 01:50:12.639 align:start position:0%
head of OBGYN department at a hospital
 
01:50:15.189 --> 01:50:15.199 align:start position:0%
in New York Lorraine carried the baby
 
01:50:18.270 --> 01:50:18.280 align:start position:0%
Cecilia to term the family held her
 
01:50:20.109 --> 01:50:20.119 align:start position:0%
including her brothers and photos were
 
01:50:21.910 --> 01:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
taken and she was actually baptized
 
01:50:24.430 --> 01:50:24.440 align:start position:0%
before she passed away a few hours after
 
01:50:26.870 --> 01:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
her birth like what was described about
 
01:50:28.950 --> 01:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
Cameron Cecilia died once she had to
 
01:50:31.550 --> 01:50:31.560 align:start position:0%
breathe with her own lungs because of
 
01:50:33.950 --> 01:50:33.960 align:start position:0%
the pressure from the ribs I attended
 
01:50:35.589 --> 01:50:35.599 align:start position:0%
the funeral and it was a beautiful death
 
01:50:37.550 --> 01:50:37.560 align:start position:0%
with love all around for
 
01:50:41.470 --> 01:50:41.480 align:start position:0%
Cecilia now my experience doctors can
 
01:50:44.270 --> 01:50:44.280 align:start position:0%
misdiagnose in 2015 here in New
 
01:50:47.510 --> 01:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at my routine 18we Ultrasound
 
01:50:49.589 --> 01:50:49.599 align:start position:0%
with my last pregnancy a concern was
 
01:50:51.750 --> 01:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
raised about the develop development of
 
01:50:54.790 --> 01:50:54.800 align:start position:0%
my son Aiden days later I was sent for a
 
01:50:57.189 --> 01:50:57.199 align:start position:0%
level two ultrasound there he was
 
01:50:59.470 --> 01:50:59.480 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with a developmental anomaly
 
01:51:02.189 --> 01:51:02.199 align:start position:0%
that although not life-threatening it
 
01:51:04.310 --> 01:51:04.320 align:start position:0%
proper if properly managed with lifelong
 
01:51:06.510 --> 01:51:06.520 align:start position:0%
medication he would have a physical
 
01:51:08.589 --> 01:51:08.599 align:start position:0%
deformation The Physician gave us
 
01:51:10.870 --> 01:51:10.880 align:start position:0%
various options including terminating
 
01:51:13.149 --> 01:51:13.159 align:start position:0%
the pregnancy or abortion is another way
 
01:51:15.669 --> 01:51:15.679 align:start position:0%
to put it my husband and I we chose to
 
01:51:17.229 --> 01:51:17.239 align:start position:0%
pursue a second opinion and went to
 
01:51:18.750 --> 01:51:18.760 align:start position:0%
Boston Children's Hospital for
 
01:51:21.109 --> 01:51:21.119 align:start position:0%
additional testing a team of doctors
 
01:51:23.589 --> 01:51:23.599 align:start position:0%
geneticists endocrinologists urologists
 
01:51:25.629 --> 01:51:25.639 align:start position:0%
among others consulted with each other
 
01:51:27.709 --> 01:51:27.719 align:start position:0%
they even met with us and determined
 
01:51:30.069 --> 01:51:30.079 align:start position:0%
that we had a totally normal healthy
 
01:51:32.109 --> 01:51:32.119 align:start position:0%
baby boy they didn't understand the
 
01:51:33.830 --> 01:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
reason behind the diagnosis from the
 
01:51:35.589 --> 01:51:35.599 align:start position:0%
doctor associated with a well-known
 
01:51:37.910 --> 01:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
hospital here in New Hampshire we of
 
01:51:39.709 --> 01:51:39.719 align:start position:0%
course wouldn't know for sure if he was
 
01:51:41.870 --> 01:51:41.880 align:start position:0%
normal until he was born and sure enough
 
01:51:44.030 --> 01:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
he was totally normal not a single thing
 
01:51:46.430 --> 01:51:46.440 align:start position:0%
was wrong with them doctors are human so
 
01:51:48.870 --> 01:51:48.880 align:start position:0%
they make mistakes too I wonder what
 
01:51:50.270 --> 01:51:50.280 align:start position:0%
would have happened to Aiden if he had
 
01:51:52.510 --> 01:51:52.520 align:start position:0%
been carried by a different mother who
 
01:51:54.390 --> 01:51:54.400 align:start position:0%
would have sought out who would not have
 
01:51:56.109 --> 01:51:56.119 align:start position:0%
sought out necessarily A cumbersome and
 
01:51:58.390 --> 01:51:58.400 align:start position:0%
expensive second option would he have
 
01:51:59.910 --> 01:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
been the victim of a therapeutic
 
01:52:02.350 --> 01:52:02.360 align:start position:0%
abortion I'm grateful that we have Aiden
 
01:52:04.470 --> 01:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
and so are his four brothers who dote on
 
01:52:07.030 --> 01:52:07.040 align:start position:0%

01:52:09.229 --> 01:52:09.239 align:start position:0%
time to hear my testimony and I welcome
 
01:52:10.750 --> 01:52:10.760 align:start position:0%

McGinley seeing none again thank thank
 
01:52:21.830 --> 01:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony
 
01:52:24.870 --> 01:52:24.880 align:start position:0%
today the next person to
 
01:52:31.310 --> 01:52:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:33.470 --> 01:52:33.480 align:start position:0%
montgomer good morning honorable members
 
01:52:35.669 --> 01:52:35.679 align:start position:0%
of the House Judiciary Committee my name
 
01:52:37.149 --> 01:52:37.159 align:start position:0%
is Kayla Montgomery I'm the director of
 
01:52:38.589 --> 01:52:38.599 align:start position:0%
public affairs for Plan paren and New
 
01:52:40.430 --> 01:52:40.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire action fund and plan parent of
 
01:52:42.030 --> 01:52:42.040 align:start position:0%
Northern New England and we oppose both
 
01:52:45.189 --> 01:52:45.199 align:start position:0%
both house bill to 625 and 622 and I
 
01:52:47.629 --> 01:52:47.639 align:start position:0%
have submitted written testimony I'd
 
01:52:49.069 --> 01:52:49.079 align:start position:0%
like to begin by reminding the committee
 
01:52:51.229 --> 01:52:51.239 align:start position:0%
that there is no no one-sized fits-all
 
01:52:53.030 --> 01:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
process when it comes to deciding if
 
01:52:55.589 --> 01:52:55.599 align:start position:0%
when or how you choose to start a family
 
01:52:57.109 --> 01:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
and there is no one-size fits-all
 
01:52:59.589 --> 01:52:59.599 align:start position:0%
pregnancy either any doctor can tell you
 
01:53:02.270 --> 01:53:02.280 align:start position:0%
every pregnancy is different and anyone
 
01:53:04.030 --> 01:53:04.040 align:start position:0%
who has experienced multiple pregnancies
 
01:53:06.430 --> 01:53:06.440 align:start position:0%
can confirm that these experience vastly
 
01:53:07.910 --> 01:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
differ each time I personally have been
 
01:53:09.870 --> 01:53:09.880 align:start position:0%
pregnant three times and each time was
 
01:53:11.910 --> 01:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
very different with bills like this with
 
01:53:14.109 --> 01:53:14.119 align:start position:0%
arbitrary band and abortion simply can't
 
01:53:15.990 --> 01:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
account for every situation because
 
01:53:18.310 --> 01:53:18.320 align:start position:0%
pregnancies are not predictable each
 
01:53:19.990 --> 01:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
pregnancy and each circumstance is
 
01:53:22.069 --> 01:53:22.079 align:start position:0%
unique and that's why when people making
 
01:53:24.550 --> 01:53:24.560 align:start position:0%
personal medical decisions one size fits
 
01:53:26.870 --> 01:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
all laws like this just don't work
 
01:53:28.790 --> 01:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
families and medical providers need to
 
01:53:30.550 --> 01:53:30.560 align:start position:0%
be able to make the best decisions in
 
01:53:32.390 --> 01:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
each circumstance and not be bound by a
 
01:53:35.350 --> 01:53:35.360 align:start position:0%
single law or policy families involved
 
01:53:37.390 --> 01:53:37.400 align:start position:0%
in these unique circumstances deserve
 
01:53:40.229 --> 01:53:40.239 align:start position:0%
our compassion and our support not our
 
01:53:42.350 --> 01:53:42.360 align:start position:0%
judgment and certainly not government
 
01:53:45.149 --> 01:53:45.159 align:start position:0%
interference bills like these politicize
 
01:53:48.030 --> 01:53:48.040 align:start position:0%
a very complex situation at the expense
 
01:53:50.589 --> 01:53:50.599 align:start position:0%
of both truth and compassion
 
01:53:52.709 --> 01:53:52.719 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is people must have the
 
01:53:55.470 --> 01:53:55.480 align:start position:0%
freedom and privacy to make decisions
 
01:53:57.189 --> 01:53:57.199 align:start position:0%
about their pregnancy and consultation
 
01:53:58.910 --> 01:53:58.920 align:start position:0%
with their doctor the state of New
 
01:54:00.390 --> 01:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire should not be in the business
 
01:54:03.069 --> 01:54:03.079 align:start position:0%
of policing individual personal medical
 
01:54:05.550 --> 01:54:05.560 align:start position:0%
decisions and finally today I want to
 
01:54:08.910 --> 01:54:08.920 align:start position:0%
share Kelly's story she lives in conquer
 
01:54:10.149 --> 01:54:10.159 align:start position:0%
and a few years ago she was pregnant
 
01:54:11.990 --> 01:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
with her second child she found out
 
01:54:13.550 --> 01:54:13.560 align:start position:0%
later in pregnancy that her son had a
 
01:54:15.430 --> 01:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
fatal diagnosis and he would likely not
 
01:54:17.669 --> 01:54:17.679 align:start position:0%
survive birth she couldn't be here today
 
01:54:19.870 --> 01:54:19.880 align:start position:0%
so I wanted to just deliver some of her
 
01:54:22.629 --> 01:54:22.639 align:start position:0%
story these are her words quote we had
 
01:54:23.990 --> 01:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
to make the most difficult Choice a
 
01:54:25.669 --> 01:54:25.679 align:start position:0%
parent could make we thought about what
 
01:54:27.229 --> 01:54:27.239 align:start position:0%
would be the best kindest thing to do
 
01:54:29.470 --> 01:54:29.480 align:start position:0%
for our child we decided to terminate
 
01:54:31.069 --> 01:54:31.079 align:start position:0%
because it was the kindest decision to
 
01:54:33.830 --> 01:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
do for our son our daughter and US
 
01:54:35.709 --> 01:54:35.719 align:start position:0%
terminating for medical reasons was the
 
01:54:37.750 --> 01:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
most difficult heart-wrenching decision
 
01:54:39.950 --> 01:54:39.960 align:start position:0%
I've ever had to make in my life I knew
 
01:54:41.669 --> 01:54:41.679 align:start position:0%
in that moment how lucky I was to have
 
01:54:44.470 --> 01:54:44.480 align:start position:0%
safe local medical care and the ability
 
01:54:46.589 --> 01:54:46.599 align:start position:0%
to choose what would be done to me I
 
01:54:47.790 --> 01:54:47.800 align:start position:0%
didn't have to go out of state to get
 
01:54:49.750 --> 01:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
the care I needed when it was over I
 
01:54:51.390 --> 01:54:51.400 align:start position:0%
hurt like any other parent would after
 
01:54:54.069 --> 01:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
losing a child each person is different
 
01:54:56.069 --> 01:54:56.079 align:start position:0%
each pregnancy is different and there is
 
01:54:58.470 --> 01:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
no one- siiz fitell solution it is
 
01:55:00.030 --> 01:55:00.040 align:start position:0%
critically important for women to focus
 
01:55:01.470 --> 01:55:01.480 align:start position:0%
on the decision that is right for her
 
01:55:03.830 --> 01:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
life her baby's life her family's life
 
01:55:05.350 --> 01:55:05.360 align:start position:0%
and not have to worry about state laws
 
01:55:07.030 --> 01:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
that don't take into account complex
 
01:55:09.550 --> 01:55:09.560 align:start position:0%
medical decisions end quote thank you
 
01:55:11.709 --> 01:55:11.719 align:start position:0%

01:56:31.750 --> 01:56:31.760 align:start position:0%
huya good morning Mr chairman can you
 
01:56:33.310 --> 01:56:33.320 align:start position:0%
hear me we
 
01:56:36.270 --> 01:56:36.280 align:start position:0%
can my name is Ian huitt I'm general
 
01:56:37.910 --> 01:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
counsel at Cornerstone which is a
 
01:56:39.669 --> 01:56:39.679 align:start position:0%
Christian advocacy group here in New
 
01:56:42.030 --> 01:56:42.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and you all have my written
 
01:56:43.790 --> 01:56:43.800 align:start position:0%
testimony but I think it probably be
 
01:56:46.109 --> 01:56:46.119 align:start position:0%
more productive if I responded to some
 
01:56:48.550 --> 01:56:48.560 align:start position:0%
of the arguments we've heard against 625
 
01:56:50.990 --> 01:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
this morning and I am only here to speak
 
01:56:53.149 --> 01:56:53.159 align:start position:0%
this morning on House Bill
 
01:56:55.990 --> 01:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
625 I was struck by the claim that this
 
01:56:57.990 --> 01:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
bill would be unfriendly to Medical
 
01:56:59.790 --> 01:56:59.800 align:start position:0%
practice and would frighten Physicians
 
01:57:02.069 --> 01:57:02.079 align:start position:0%
away from New Hampshire as being a
 
01:57:04.270 --> 01:57:04.280 align:start position:0%
medically unfriendly State I think the
 
01:57:06.470 --> 01:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
clearest illustration of that not being
 
01:57:09.350 --> 01:57:09.360 align:start position:0%
the case is Massachusetts until very
 
01:57:11.910 --> 01:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
recently in Massachusetts most abortions
 
01:57:15.629 --> 01:57:15.639 align:start position:0%
at or after 24 weeks were felony crimes
 
01:57:18.069 --> 01:57:18.079 align:start position:0%
and Massachusetts had a health exception
 
01:57:20.189 --> 01:57:20.199 align:start position:0%
but it was a narrowly Frank clearly
 
01:57:22.750 --> 01:57:22.760 align:start position:0%
defined Health exception for serious
 
01:57:26.310 --> 01:57:26.320 align:start position:0%
risk of grave bodily harm but in just
 
01:57:28.149 --> 01:57:28.159 align:start position:0%
December the Massachusetts Medical
 
01:57:30.390 --> 01:57:30.400 align:start position:0%
Society planed Parenthood action and
 
01:57:32.229 --> 01:57:32.239 align:start position:0%
other groups successfully fought to
 
01:57:35.229 --> 01:57:35.239 align:start position:0%
repeal those laws and legalize abortion
 
01:57:38.229 --> 01:57:38.239 align:start position:0%
at any time in Massachusetts after 24
 
01:57:40.189 --> 01:57:40.199 align:start position:0%
weeks I think most of us know
 
01:57:42.669 --> 01:57:42.679 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts was not before December a
 
01:57:45.510 --> 01:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
desert of Medical Practice US News
 
01:57:47.629 --> 01:57:47.639 align:start position:0%
actually ranks Massachusetts the second
 
01:57:50.109 --> 01:57:50.119 align:start position:0%
best in the nation in Act access to
 
01:57:52.310 --> 01:57:52.320 align:start position:0%
Quality healthare and I don't think that
 
01:57:54.069 --> 01:57:54.079 align:start position:0%
came out of nowhere in December when
 
01:57:57.390 --> 01:57:57.400 align:start position:0%
they legalized abortion up to birth I
 
01:57:59.109 --> 01:57:59.119 align:start position:0%
was particularly struck by the claim
 
01:58:01.430 --> 01:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
that 24 weeks is just an arbitrary
 
01:58:03.790 --> 01:58:03.800 align:start position:0%
number and this is interesting because
 
01:58:05.910 --> 01:58:05.920 align:start position:0%
in 2018 there was an attempt to
 
01:58:08.629 --> 01:58:08.639 align:start position:0%
introduce a viability Bill and one of
 
01:58:11.149 --> 01:58:11.159 align:start position:0%
the main objections from the minority
 
01:58:12.910 --> 01:58:12.920 align:start position:0%
committee report of this committee and
 
01:58:14.910 --> 01:58:14.920 align:start position:0%
you can see this footnoted in my written
 
01:58:17.790 --> 01:58:17.800 align:start position:0%
testimony was that viability was too
 
01:58:20.669 --> 01:58:20.679 align:start position:0%
subjective a standard viability varies
 
01:58:22.750 --> 01:58:22.760 align:start position:0%
from case to Case and it didn't provide
 
01:58:25.189 --> 01:58:25.199 align:start position:0%
a clear rule of law now of course we're
 
01:58:27.430 --> 01:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
hearing that a 24-week line is too
 
01:58:29.390 --> 01:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
arbitrary and I think we can all
 
01:58:31.629 --> 01:58:31.639 align:start position:0%
candidly admit at this point the actual
 
01:58:34.350 --> 01:58:34.360 align:start position:0%
objection is not to vagueness or to
 
01:58:36.589 --> 01:58:36.599 align:start position:0%
arbitrariness but to just any
 
01:58:39.430 --> 01:58:39.440 align:start position:0%
restriction whatsoever on abortion prior
 
01:58:41.790 --> 01:58:41.800 align:start position:0%
to birth which I think the data shows is
 
01:58:43.589 --> 01:58:43.599 align:start position:0%
not consistent with the values of the
 
01:58:46.830 --> 01:58:46.840 align:start position:0%
majority of people in New Hampshire both
 
01:58:49.270 --> 01:58:49.280 align:start position:0%
row and Casey affirmed as one of their
 
01:58:51.390 --> 01:58:51.400 align:start position:0%
Central premises that pregnancy is
 
01:58:53.030 --> 01:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
different from other situations
 
01:58:54.830 --> 01:58:54.840 align:start position:0%
involving privacy because a woman
 
01:58:57.470 --> 01:58:57.480 align:start position:0%
carries a fetus and at some point in
 
01:58:59.950 --> 01:58:59.960 align:start position:0%
time the state has legitimate interest
 
01:59:02.270 --> 01:59:02.280 align:start position:0%
in protecting fetal life I don't think
 
01:59:04.069 --> 01:59:04.079 align:start position:0%
in any of the critical testimony we've
 
01:59:06.430 --> 01:59:06.440 align:start position:0%
heard today has that interest even been
 
01:59:08.750 --> 01:59:08.760 align:start position:0%
acknowledged the interest in fetal life
 
01:59:10.589 --> 01:59:10.599 align:start position:0%
isn't being balanced against other
 
01:59:13.270 --> 01:59:13.280 align:start position:0%
interests it's being simply disappeared
 
01:59:15.350 --> 01:59:15.360 align:start position:0%
and that's because the organizations
 
01:59:18.950 --> 01:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
critical of 625 in fact don't recognize
 
01:59:21.910 --> 01:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
the holding of row and Casey this bill
 
01:59:24.149 --> 01:59:24.159 align:start position:0%
does and in fact it's more modest than
 
01:59:27.149 --> 01:59:27.159 align:start position:0%
those cases in what it prohibits it is
 
01:59:29.830 --> 01:59:29.840 align:start position:0%
not a piece of Flesh the size of a pinky
 
01:59:32.350 --> 01:59:32.360 align:start position:0%
this is a recognizable human infant that
 
01:59:34.629 --> 01:59:34.639 align:start position:0%
can be delivered as you've heard from Dr
 
01:59:38.189 --> 01:59:38.199 align:start position:0%
basl and I think Dr Ki Rock and right
 
01:59:40.750 --> 01:59:40.760 align:start position:0%
now in New Hampshire that infant has no
 
01:59:43.270 --> 01:59:43.280 align:start position:0%
legal protections whatsoever under our
 
01:59:45.790 --> 01:59:45.800 align:start position:0%
criminal law and I'm happy to answer any
 
01:59:48.510 --> 01:59:48.520 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much are there
 
01:59:52.030 --> 01:59:52.040 align:start position:0%

02:01:13.870 --> 02:01:13.880 align:start position:0%
this bill claiming my right to privacy
 
02:01:15.589 --> 02:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
my right to do what I please with my
 
02:01:18.470 --> 02:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
body and my Reproductive Rights but I'm
 
02:01:20.950 --> 02:01:20.960 align:start position:0%
not here to do that I'm here to do the
 
02:01:23.470 --> 02:01:23.480 align:start position:0%
opposite the arguments for abortive
 
02:01:25.510 --> 02:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
rights get more sophisticated and
 
02:01:28.310 --> 02:01:28.320 align:start position:0%
complex with time this alone should
 
02:01:30.750 --> 02:01:30.760 align:start position:0%
cause us to pause because the truth is
 
02:01:33.709 --> 02:01:33.719 align:start position:0%
always simple yes the application of
 
02:01:36.149 --> 02:01:36.159 align:start position:0%
Truth does require immense wisdom and
 
02:01:38.229 --> 02:01:38.239 align:start position:0%
discernment but the principles are
 
02:01:40.669 --> 02:01:40.679 align:start position:0%
always simple and we cannot deviate from
 
02:01:43.189 --> 02:01:43.199 align:start position:0%
them and still expect Society to
 
02:01:45.990 --> 02:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
flourish today the simple truth is that
 
02:01:49.069 --> 02:01:49.079 align:start position:0%
life in the womb is just that life and
 
02:01:51.589 --> 02:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
life is always precious and worthy of
 
02:01:55.310 --> 02:01:55.320 align:start position:0%
protection HB 625 protects the precious
 
02:01:58.030 --> 02:01:58.040 align:start position:0%
life of both the pre-born and the
 
02:02:01.109 --> 02:02:01.119 align:start position:0%
mother one particular argument in favor
 
02:02:03.589 --> 02:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
of abortive rights after 24 weeks is
 
02:02:06.550 --> 02:02:06.560 align:start position:0%
over fetal anomalies this argument
 
02:02:08.709 --> 02:02:08.719 align:start position:0%
requires the belief that life is only
 
02:02:10.790 --> 02:02:10.800 align:start position:0%
worth living if it will be free from
 
02:02:13.430 --> 02:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
suffering suffering for a child who has
 
02:02:15.830 --> 02:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
the possibility of a disability and
 
02:02:17.990 --> 02:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
suffering for the parent whose own life
 
02:02:20.550 --> 02:02:20.560 align:start position:0%
could be greatly impact Ed by a disabled
 
02:02:23.830 --> 02:02:23.840 align:start position:0%
child well as the proud older sister of
 
02:02:25.950 --> 02:02:25.960 align:start position:0%
a brother with immense cognitive and
 
02:02:28.750 --> 02:02:28.760 align:start position:0%
physical disabilities I fully disagree
 
02:02:31.430 --> 02:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
with this premise the truth is we all
 
02:02:33.350 --> 02:02:33.360 align:start position:0%
inconvenience each other and there is
 
02:02:36.430 --> 02:02:36.440 align:start position:0%
only one possible life for all of us a
 
02:02:40.069 --> 02:02:40.079 align:start position:0%
hard life we all suffer life unfolds
 
02:02:43.189 --> 02:02:43.199 align:start position:0%
unexpectedly for all of us but it can
 
02:02:46.069 --> 02:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
still be beautiful if we realize another
 
02:02:48.430 --> 02:02:48.440 align:start position:0%
simple truth that life is meant to be
 
02:02:51.430 --> 02:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
lived s sacrificially for others though
 
02:02:54.470 --> 02:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
I'm not here to claim rights for myself
 
02:02:56.109 --> 02:02:56.119 align:start position:0%
my parents have beautifully lived out
 
02:02:57.990 --> 02:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
their conviction that life is well-lived
 
02:03:01.189 --> 02:03:01.199 align:start position:0%
and full of joy when you stay lock step
 
02:03:03.149 --> 02:03:03.159 align:start position:0%
with the simple truth that life is
 
02:03:05.750 --> 02:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
precious and worthy of protection no
 
02:03:07.350 --> 02:03:07.360 align:start position:0%
matter the personal
 
02:03:10.229 --> 02:03:10.239 align:start position:0%
sacrifice I envy your position and your
 
02:03:12.709 --> 02:03:12.719 align:start position:0%

by my one of my
 
02:05:00.790 --> 02:05:00.800 align:start position:0%
brother-in-laws and to be
 
02:05:04.430 --> 02:05:04.440 align:start position:0%
honest when someone try to tell me what
 
02:05:06.750 --> 02:05:06.760 align:start position:0%
is right and what is wrong for my body
 
02:05:08.990 --> 02:05:09.000 align:start position:0%

02:05:22.790 --> 02:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
have an
 
02:05:26.109 --> 02:05:26.119 align:start position:0%
abortion a lot of times especially in my
 
02:05:29.510 --> 02:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
culture people don't know the right and
 
02:05:31.629 --> 02:05:31.639 align:start position:0%
a lot of times they don't know they
 
02:05:33.310 --> 02:05:33.320 align:start position:0%
don't they don't speak the language so
 
02:05:36.069 --> 02:05:36.079 align:start position:0%

be honest if
 
02:05:53.750 --> 02:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
as a victim of sexual assault I should
 
02:05:56.470 --> 02:05:56.480 align:start position:0%
have the right to decide what what is
 
02:06:04.750 --> 02:06:04.760 align:start position:0%

committee uh thank you for your patience
 
02:06:35.390 --> 02:06:35.400 align:start position:0%
my name is Jason Hennessy I'm a resident
 
02:06:37.589 --> 02:06:37.599 align:start position:0%
of mher New Hampshire and the president
 
02:06:39.549 --> 02:06:39.559 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire right to life I'm here
 
02:06:43.069 --> 02:06:43.079 align:start position:0%
to speak in favor of both HB 622 as well
 
02:06:44.350 --> 02:06:44.360 align:start position:0%
as HB
 
02:06:47.030 --> 02:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
625 um so I would like to ask the
 
02:06:49.589 --> 02:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
committee members to consider two things
 
02:06:51.149 --> 02:06:51.159 align:start position:0%
um as they're contemplating this two
 
02:06:53.589 --> 02:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
questions the first one is who is a
 
02:06:55.830 --> 02:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
person and the second one is what
 
02:06:58.270 --> 02:06:58.280 align:start position:0%
protections to do those people
 
02:07:00.430 --> 02:07:00.440 align:start position:0%
deserve um and I'd like to submit to you
 
02:07:01.950 --> 02:07:01.960 align:start position:0%
that most of the the great human
 
02:07:04.149 --> 02:07:04.159 align:start position:0%
atrocities that you can think of happen
 
02:07:06.549 --> 02:07:06.559 align:start position:0%
when a society gets one or both of these
 
02:07:08.830 --> 02:07:08.840 align:start position:0%
wrong so on the question of who is a
 
02:07:11.510 --> 02:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
person um some some other questions to
 
02:07:13.310 --> 02:07:13.320 align:start position:0%
ask yourself should that should that
 
02:07:15.430 --> 02:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
definition depend on someone else's
 
02:07:17.510 --> 02:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
Choice uh should that be based on a
 
02:07:20.189 --> 02:07:20.199 align:start position:0%
crime committed before they conceived or
 
02:07:21.470 --> 02:07:21.480 align:start position:0%
whether someone thinks that their life
 
02:07:22.510 --> 02:07:22.520 align:start position:0%
is worth
 
02:07:25.069 --> 02:07:25.079 align:start position:0%
living the the gooder Institute says
 
02:07:28.350 --> 02:07:28.360 align:start position:0%
that 43 St 43 states have some
 
02:07:32.709 --> 02:07:32.719 align:start position:0%
restriction on um on on abortion up up
 
02:07:36.910 --> 02:07:36.920 align:start position:0%
into uh lat term viability bands so in
 
02:07:40.750 --> 02:07:40.760 align:start position:0%
other words 86% of States agree that
 
02:07:43.069 --> 02:07:43.079 align:start position:0%
there should be some sort of restriction
 
02:07:45.950 --> 02:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
um and and the and the the number of
 
02:07:48.629 --> 02:07:48.639 align:start position:0%
weeks that are proposed in HB 625
 
02:07:50.549 --> 02:07:50.559 align:start position:0%
reflects the the the very the very
 
02:07:53.270 --> 02:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
latest end of that 24 weeks is the very
 
02:07:55.149 --> 02:07:55.159 align:start position:0%
is the very latest of that and so I'd
 
02:07:56.950 --> 02:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
like to speak in support of this of
 
02:07:59.189 --> 02:07:59.199 align:start position:0%
these bills and I would love to take any
 
02:08:00.669 --> 02:08:00.679 align:start position:0%
questions you might
 
02:08:03.510 --> 02:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
have very much Mr Hennessy are there any

flight certified paramedic and EMS
 
02:08:46.510 --> 02:08:46.520 align:start position:0%
educator I'm speaking today on behalf of
 
02:08:49.030 --> 02:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
myself and not any organization
 
02:08:51.189 --> 02:08:51.199 align:start position:0%
um speaking in support of houseal 622
 
02:08:51.199 --> 02:08:52.750 align:start position:0%
um speaking in support of houseal 622
and

02:08:52.750 --> 02:08:52.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:08:55.990 --> 02:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
625 as a paramedic I've been in Ems for
 
02:08:58.910 --> 02:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
about uh 10 years now since 2011 pretty
 
02:09:02.310 --> 02:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
much we determine life on a heartbeat
 
02:09:04.629 --> 02:09:04.639 align:start position:0%
essentially we I can declare death when
 
02:09:07.030 --> 02:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
I work cardiac arrests I can declare a
 
02:09:08.189 --> 02:09:08.199 align:start position:0%
time of death and that's based on
 
02:09:10.669 --> 02:09:10.679 align:start position:0%
heartbeat when there's no heartbeat we
 
02:09:13.149 --> 02:09:13.159 align:start position:0%
generally resuscitate and when we feel
 
02:09:14.830 --> 02:09:14.840 align:start position:0%
that there no longer is any chance of
 
02:09:16.470 --> 02:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
resuscitating the heartbeat and there's
 
02:09:18.830 --> 02:09:18.840 align:start position:0%
been no heartbeat for 10 20 30 minutes
 
02:09:20.870 --> 02:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
depending on the rest of the metrics
 
02:09:23.430 --> 02:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
like entitle CO2 and other metrics uh we
 
02:09:25.709 --> 02:09:25.719 align:start position:0%
can then ter we declare death in a time
 
02:09:28.470 --> 02:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
of death so heartbeat is generally when
 
02:09:30.709 --> 02:09:30.719 align:start position:0%
we when we uh consider someone to be
 
02:09:31.750 --> 02:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
alive or not
 
02:09:31.760 --> 02:09:33.750 align:start position:0%
alive or not
alive

02:09:33.750 --> 02:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
alive
 
02:09:36.069 --> 02:09:36.079 align:start position:0%
um So currently I think that there's a
 
02:09:37.870 --> 02:09:37.880 align:start position:0%
heartbeat at six weeks maybe eight weeks
 
02:09:39.350 --> 02:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
maybe 10 weeks but I think around six
 
02:09:41.870 --> 02:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
weeks uh a baby can have a heartbeat
 
02:09:42.910 --> 02:09:42.920 align:start position:0%
inside the
 
02:09:45.669 --> 02:09:45.679 align:start position:0%
womb uh it's very interesting to hear
 
02:09:49.350 --> 02:09:49.360 align:start position:0%
some some uh arguments about viability
 
02:09:50.790 --> 02:09:50.800 align:start position:0%
I've I've treated thousands of patients
 
02:09:52.149 --> 02:09:52.159 align:start position:0%
a lot of very critical patients in my
 
02:09:54.629 --> 02:09:54.639 align:start position:0%
career U maybe around 10,000 patients
 
02:09:56.510 --> 02:09:56.520 align:start position:0%
many of them were very severely ill
 
02:09:59.950 --> 02:09:59.960 align:start position:0%
chronically or acutely or both um I
 
02:10:02.270 --> 02:10:02.280 align:start position:0%
think that many patients I've treated in
 
02:10:05.589 --> 02:10:05.599 align:start position:0%
my career have a much worse mortality
 
02:10:07.830 --> 02:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
rate a worse viability chance than a
 
02:10:11.030 --> 02:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
baby at 25 weeks which is 50 to 80% I've
 
02:10:12.950 --> 02:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
had many many patients in my ambulance
 
02:10:15.310 --> 02:10:15.320 align:start position:0%
whose viability out to out to a few
 
02:10:17.589 --> 02:10:17.599 align:start position:0%
months was maybe 1% because they were
 
02:10:19.669 --> 02:10:19.679 align:start position:0%
extremely sever ill yet I could not kill
 
02:10:21.709 --> 02:10:21.719 align:start position:0%
them that would be called Murder um and
 
02:10:24.030 --> 02:10:24.040 align:start position:0%
I did not kill them um so that's another
 
02:10:24.040 --> 02:10:25.109 align:start position:0%
I did not kill them um so that's another
interesting

02:10:25.109 --> 02:10:25.119 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
02:10:27.229 --> 02:10:27.239 align:start position:0%
point another point I want to make is
 
02:10:29.990 --> 02:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
that government has if it has one or or
 
02:10:32.109 --> 02:10:32.119 align:start position:0%
two specific purposes it's to protect
 
02:10:34.270 --> 02:10:34.280 align:start position:0%
life and Liberty and this is one of the
 
02:10:36.030 --> 02:10:36.040 align:start position:0%
very few things those who know me know I
 
02:10:37.430 --> 02:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
don't want government to do many things
 
02:10:38.950 --> 02:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
but if they are to exist they should
 
02:10:41.629 --> 02:10:41.639 align:start position:0%
protect life life and Liberty so this is
 
02:10:42.950 --> 02:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
it protecting life of the most
 
02:10:44.990 --> 02:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
vulnerable because they're babies uh the
 
02:10:46.229 --> 02:10:46.239 align:start position:0%
fact that they're a baby now and you
 
02:10:48.270 --> 02:10:48.280 align:start position:0%
think one minute prior to them being
 
02:10:50.310 --> 02:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
born outside of the uterus they're not a
 
02:10:52.709 --> 02:10:52.719 align:start position:0%
human that I don't really understand
 
02:10:54.430 --> 02:10:54.440 align:start position:0%
that logic if they're a baby now they
 
02:10:55.790 --> 02:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
were a baby they were a human one minute
 
02:10:55.800 --> 02:10:57.109 align:start position:0%
were a baby they were a human one minute
ago

02:10:57.109 --> 02:10:57.119 align:start position:0%
ago
 
02:10:57.119 --> 02:10:58.750 align:start position:0%
ago
too

02:10:58.750 --> 02:10:58.760 align:start position:0%
too
 
02:11:01.270 --> 02:11:01.280 align:start position:0%
um I think a few people today mentioned
 
02:11:04.030 --> 02:11:04.040 align:start position:0%
that if these House Bill 622 and 625
 
02:11:06.030 --> 02:11:06.040 align:start position:0%
pass medical providers won't want to
 
02:11:07.910 --> 02:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
come to New Hampshire um that has not
 
02:11:09.589 --> 02:11:09.599 align:start position:0%
been my experience I I moved to New
 
02:11:11.870 --> 02:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from New York another
 
02:11:13.390 --> 02:11:13.400 align:start position:0%
Progressive state that that allowed for
 
02:11:14.430 --> 02:11:14.440 align:start position:0%
abortion it's one of the few other
 
02:11:15.750 --> 02:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
states with no restrictions I believe
 
02:11:17.870 --> 02:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
now only eight States including New
 
02:11:19.149 --> 02:11:19.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in New York have no
 
02:11:21.069 --> 02:11:21.079 align:start position:0%
restrictions on abortions essentially
 
02:11:22.950 --> 02:11:22.960 align:start position:0%
late ter abortion but I don't know of
 
02:11:24.510 --> 02:11:24.520 align:start position:0%
any paramedics I don't I know a lot of
 
02:11:25.870 --> 02:11:25.880 align:start position:0%
paramedics I know fewer doctors and
 
02:11:27.709 --> 02:11:27.719 align:start position:0%
nurses but I don't know if any medical
 
02:11:30.149 --> 02:11:30.159 align:start position:0%
provider who enjoys uh killing babies
 
02:11:31.910 --> 02:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
and I don't think if if these bills
 
02:11:34.669 --> 02:11:34.679 align:start position:0%
passed people uh doctors nurses medical
 
02:11:36.549 --> 02:11:36.559 align:start position:0%
providers paramedics would be less
 
02:11:38.229 --> 02:11:38.239 align:start position:0%
likely to move to New Hampshire because
 
02:11:40.750 --> 02:11:40.760 align:start position:0%
they didn't have that so-called right to
 
02:11:44.750 --> 02:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
abort babies um I also want to point out
 
02:11:46.430 --> 02:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
that this is the the same legislature I
 
02:11:48.350 --> 02:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
think a year ago that did not pass the
 
02:11:50.030 --> 02:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
bill that simply would have protected
 
02:11:51.629 --> 02:11:51.639 align:start position:0%
babies who were born outside of the
 
02:11:53.350 --> 02:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
uterus who were alive and kicking and
 
02:11:54.950 --> 02:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
crying uh a bill that would have
 
02:11:56.629 --> 02:11:56.639 align:start position:0%
prevented them from being killed I think
 
02:11:58.069 --> 02:11:58.079 align:start position:0%
this legislature stopped that bill and
 
02:12:00.229 --> 02:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
did not pass it which was disappointing
 
02:12:01.549 --> 02:12:01.559 align:start position:0%
and rather
 
02:12:03.830 --> 02:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
disturbing um I think that's pretty much
 
02:12:05.109 --> 02:12:05.119 align:start position:0%
all I want to say I mean if we talk
 
02:12:07.750 --> 02:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
about viability and uh Consciousness and
 
02:12:10.109 --> 02:12:10.119 align:start position:0%
how smart they are we I've had so many
 
02:12:12.229 --> 02:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
patients who are on ventilators and and
 
02:12:14.310 --> 02:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
essentially are in the vegetative state
 
02:12:15.629 --> 02:12:15.639 align:start position:0%
yet I didn't kill them I couldn't kill
 
02:12:16.870 --> 02:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
them I wouldn't want to kill them it's
 
02:12:19.229 --> 02:12:19.239 align:start position:0%
not legal to kill them um in fact those
 
02:12:21.589 --> 02:12:21.599 align:start position:0%
patients or 85 years old might have a
 
02:12:23.549 --> 02:12:23.559 align:start position:0%
DNR have already lived a long life
 
02:12:26.830 --> 02:12:26.840 align:start position:0%
whereas babies have not lived yet and
 
02:12:29.109 --> 02:12:29.119 align:start position:0%
are innocent and have potential to live
 
02:12:30.669 --> 02:12:30.679 align:start position:0%
and just because they don't have yet
 
02:12:32.470 --> 02:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
intelligent brains like you and I
 
02:12:33.950 --> 02:12:33.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean we should be uh killing
 
02:12:35.910 --> 02:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
them so if we use one argument we should
 
02:12:37.669 --> 02:12:37.679 align:start position:0%
also make it legal to kill all old
 
02:12:39.390 --> 02:12:39.400 align:start position:0%
people who have moderate to severe
 
02:12:41.589 --> 02:12:41.599 align:start position:0%
dementia which I'm not in favor of
 
02:12:44.030 --> 02:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
killing 80 million Americans right now
 
02:12:45.910 --> 02:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much and that's it
 
02:12:47.350 --> 02:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
exceeded the three minutes so I'm just
 
02:12:49.830 --> 02:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
going to ask you to finish up oh that's
 
02:12:53.669 --> 02:12:53.679 align:start position:0%
all thank you thank you any
 
02:12:56.109 --> 02:12:56.119 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr axelman for your
 
02:12:56.119 --> 02:12:57.870 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr axelman for your
testimony

02:12:57.870 --> 02:12:57.880 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:13:01.069 --> 02:13:01.079 align:start position:0%
today uh we have an
 
02:13:03.589 --> 02:13:03.599 align:start position:0%
individual who identifies herself as
 
02:13:10.629 --> 02:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:18.790 --> 02:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
testify hello hello hi hi um yes uh I
 
02:13:23.189 --> 02:13:23.199 align:start position:0%
support um passing House Bill 625 and
 
02:13:28.109 --> 02:13:28.119 align:start position:0%
622 um there's so many states that have
 
02:13:30.830 --> 02:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
restrictions like at 22 weeks at 20
 
02:13:33.390 --> 02:13:33.400 align:start position:0%
weeks I don't know why New Hampshire is
 
02:13:35.990 --> 02:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
so backwards on this a woman earlier
 
02:13:37.910 --> 02:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
said that we keep bringing this up and
 
02:13:40.870 --> 02:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
we keep bringing this up because it's so
 
02:13:45.149 --> 02:13:45.159 align:start position:0%
basic um Alabama 22 weeks Arkansas 22
 
02:13:48.229 --> 02:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
weeks Florida 24 weeks Georgia 22 weeks
 
02:13:51.790 --> 02:13:51.800 align:start position:0%

02:13:54.189 --> 02:13:54.199 align:start position:0%

Wisconsin
 
02:14:07.950 --> 02:14:07.960 align:start position:0%
Virginia I don't I'm sure I hope that
 
02:14:11.229 --> 02:14:11.239 align:start position:0%
whoever is voting that you've probably
 
02:14:13.149 --> 02:14:13.159 align:start position:0%
already made up your minds on how you're
 
02:14:16.390 --> 02:14:16.400 align:start position:0%
going to vote but I hope that you don't
 
02:14:18.709 --> 02:14:18.719 align:start position:0%
just vote how you've always voted voted
 
02:14:20.950 --> 02:14:20.960 align:start position:0%
because New Hampshire doesn't have to be
 
02:14:23.669 --> 02:14:23.679 align:start position:0%
this way like New Hampshire says
 
02:14:27.470 --> 02:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
everyone should live free or die but I
 
02:14:30.069 --> 02:14:30.079 align:start position:0%
think we all know that we'd rather live
 
02:14:33.549 --> 02:14:33.559 align:start position:0%
free um there's no reason for New
 
02:14:37.270 --> 02:14:37.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to um just be so backwards and
 
02:14:42.350 --> 02:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
so callous um and so wishy-washy on
 
02:14:46.229 --> 02:14:46.239 align:start position:0%
abortion um like there's no reason I
 
02:14:48.589 --> 02:14:48.599 align:start position:0%
don't understand and I hope you guys
 
02:14:50.229 --> 02:14:50.239 align:start position:0%
just don't always vote the same way
 
02:14:54.669 --> 02:14:54.679 align:start position:0%
you've been voting um and I just plea
 
02:14:58.950 --> 02:14:58.960 align:start position:0%
with you that um it's just please do not
 
02:15:01.109 --> 02:15:01.119 align:start position:0%
have cold Hearts as cold as the weather
 
02:15:04.470 --> 02:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
is here please do not have cold Hearts
 
02:15:07.109 --> 02:15:07.119 align:start position:0%
um I I don't know how else to say this
 
02:15:10.990 --> 02:15:11.000 align:start position:0%
that um they said that um women have a
 
02:15:13.709 --> 02:15:13.719 align:start position:0%
right to their bodies but there's also
 
02:15:16.189 --> 02:15:16.199 align:start position:0%
another body and those are women too
 
02:15:19.310 --> 02:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
they're probably half women and Half Men
 
02:15:23.669 --> 02:15:23.679 align:start position:0%
um growing inside women's bodies so it's
 
02:15:30.709 --> 02:15:30.719 align:start position:0%
I just I just beg you and please vote
 
02:15:36.390 --> 02:15:36.400 align:start position:0%
with your heart that um that yeah babies
 
02:15:40.229 --> 02:15:40.239 align:start position:0%
fetuses babies are people and they
 
02:15:44.390 --> 02:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
deserve to live and you cannot just not
 
02:15:47.069 --> 02:15:47.079 align:start position:0%
six months the The Spill is about six
 
02:15:49.790 --> 02:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
months you're allowing pregnant you're
 
02:15:53.910 --> 02:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
allowing abortions at six months and I I
 
02:15:57.189 --> 02:15:57.199 align:start position:0%

02:17:55.549 --> 02:17:55.559 align:start position:0%
night um thank you chairman and members
 
02:17:59.070 --> 02:17:59.080 align:start position:0%
of the committee I'm here as a
 
02:18:00.910 --> 02:18:00.920 align:start position:0%
representative of New Hampshire
 
02:18:04.110 --> 02:18:04.120 align:start position:0%
Manchester Ward 4 and I just wanted to
 
02:18:07.990 --> 02:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
say some things as I watch this live
 
02:18:11.549 --> 02:18:11.559 align:start position:0%
hearing and I'm here to represent my
 
02:18:14.389 --> 02:18:14.399 align:start position:0%
people I hear a lot of talk of
 
02:18:19.349 --> 02:18:19.359 align:start position:0%
compassion and having a heart and and um
 
02:18:20.629 --> 02:18:20.639 align:start position:0%
you know all these things that we do
 
02:18:23.469 --> 02:18:23.479 align:start position:0%
need to take in consideration for our
 
02:18:26.389 --> 02:18:26.399 align:start position:0%
communities and it really troubles me
 
02:18:28.990 --> 02:18:29.000 align:start position:0%
because I don't see if this were Bill
 
02:18:31.870 --> 02:18:31.880 align:start position:0%
were to pass any infrastructure on how
 
02:18:35.230 --> 02:18:35.240 align:start position:0%
to take care of more children that may
 
02:18:37.750 --> 02:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
not be in a comfortable living situation
 
02:18:41.030 --> 02:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
a safe living situation or for any
 
02:18:43.230 --> 02:18:43.240 align:start position:0%
parents that may have not felt prepared
 
02:18:44.990 --> 02:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
in that moment for whatever personal
 
02:18:47.309 --> 02:18:47.319 align:start position:0%
reasons I just don't I see that there's
 
02:18:50.309 --> 02:18:50.319 align:start position:0%
a major black hole here for taking care
 
02:18:52.349 --> 02:18:52.359 align:start position:0%
of people that already need to be taken
 
02:18:56.589 --> 02:18:56.599 align:start position:0%
care of and a support system for people
 
02:19:00.669 --> 02:19:00.679 align:start position:0%
that will be majorly displaced um the
 
02:19:04.150 --> 02:19:04.160 align:start position:0%
you know are are my my taxpayers here
 
02:19:06.389 --> 02:19:06.399 align:start position:0%
they want to know how many people we
 
02:19:08.549 --> 02:19:08.559 align:start position:0%
might need to be putting on assistance
 
02:19:10.910 --> 02:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
and I think these are fair questions for
 
02:19:14.030 --> 02:19:14.040 align:start position:0%
any of our people in New Hampshire that
 
02:19:16.349 --> 02:19:16.359 align:start position:0%
pay taxes and I know my colleagues would
 
02:19:18.429 --> 02:19:18.439 align:start position:0%
agree on the other side that if this has
 
02:19:21.389 --> 02:19:21.399 align:start position:0%
an untended consequence of up beinging
 
02:19:23.629 --> 02:19:23.639 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire welfare and other
 
02:19:26.150 --> 02:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
assistances that we have done ourselves
 
02:19:28.349 --> 02:19:28.359 align:start position:0%
a huge disservice not not only to our
 
02:19:30.750 --> 02:19:30.760 align:start position:0%
communities and families but our direct
 
02:19:33.990 --> 02:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and I want that to be mindful
 
02:19:37.349 --> 02:19:37.359 align:start position:0%
of the people um if you care about human
 
02:19:40.709 --> 02:19:40.719 align:start position:0%
life I understand but uh you know
 
02:19:43.110 --> 02:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
there's other unintended consequences
 
02:19:45.549 --> 02:19:45.559 align:start position:0%
here um and we need to take a look at
 
02:19:47.830 --> 02:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
that thank you thank you you for your
 
02:19:49.910 --> 02:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
testimony are there any questions for
 
02:19:52.830 --> 02:19:52.840 align:start position:0%

testify yes I I'm uh speaking that uh Dr
 
02:20:08.710 --> 02:20:08.720 align:start position:0%

you very
 
02:20:31.910 --> 02:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
much I see no other hands raised at this
 
02:20:37.510 --> 02:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
time and that being the case I am going
 
02:20:40.830 --> 02:20:40.840 align:start position:0%
to uh declare that the hearing on house
 
02:20:43.070 --> 02:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
bills 622 and
 
02:20:46.309 --> 02:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
625 be
 
02:20:49.790 --> 02:20:49.800 align:start position:0%
closed We're not scheduled to come back

until 2:00 this afternoon to hear the
 
02:20:54.270 --> 02:20:54.280 align:start position:0%
remaining bill
 
02:20:58.670 --> 02:20:58.680 align:start position:0%
today h 4:30 there are 17 speakers who
 
02:21:00.710 --> 02:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
are scheduled on that bill this
 
02:21:03.469 --> 02:21:03.479 align:start position:0%
afternoon and we'll play by the same
 
02:21:05.469 --> 02:21:05.479 align:start position:0%
three minute rule this
 
02:21:08.150 --> 02:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
afternoon I had anticipated that the
 
02:21:10.710 --> 02:21:10.720 align:start position:0%
testimony might go longer this morning
 
02:21:12.070 --> 02:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
particularly based upon the number of
 
02:21:15.750 --> 02:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
emails we received um so you do have
 
02:21:19.150 --> 02:21:19.160 align:start position:0%
some time off during lunch time
 
02:21:21.309 --> 02:21:21.319 align:start position:0%
I when I sent out my email before I just
 
02:21:23.469 --> 02:21:23.479 align:start position:0%
wanted to let you know that I had asked
 
02:21:25.590 --> 02:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
if we could we're we're going to be
 
02:21:27.190 --> 02:21:27.200 align:start position:0%
scheduled to have our hearing our
 
02:21:29.750 --> 02:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
regular Tuesday hearing on the 16th I
 
02:21:31.750 --> 02:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
had asked leadership if we could have
 
02:21:34.270 --> 02:21:34.280 align:start position:0%
the 17th but all of the committee
 
02:21:36.590 --> 02:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
meeting rooms are full at this point in
 
02:21:39.150 --> 02:21:39.160 align:start position:0%
time and we're unable to have a hearing
 
02:21:40.389 --> 02:21:40.399 align:start position:0%
on the
 
02:21:43.990 --> 02:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
17th uh so you don't need to plan for
 
02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.030 align:start position:0%
17th uh so you don't need to plan for
that

02:21:46.030 --> 02:21:46.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:21:49.630 --> 02:21:49.640 align:start position:0%
and um but I think after and we're going
 
02:21:52.429 --> 02:21:52.439 align:start position:0%
to have session on the 24th and and
 
02:21:55.309 --> 02:21:55.319 align:start position:0%
25th uh after that we're definitely
 
02:21:57.190 --> 02:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
going to have to given the number of
 
02:22:00.030 --> 02:22:00.040 align:start position:0%
bills that we have we're definitely
 
02:22:02.309 --> 02:22:02.319 align:start position:0%
going to have to double up uh during the
 
02:22:05.349 --> 02:22:05.359 align:start position:0%
weeks and you can anticipate
 
02:22:07.990 --> 02:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
that and unless there's some questions
 
02:22:11.230 --> 02:22:11.240 align:start position:0%
or anything somebody like to
 
02:22:16.150 --> 02:22:16.160 align:start position:0%

04:55:55.150 --> 04:55:55.160 align:start position:0%
but I was asked is it copy is it
 
04:55:56.830 --> 04:55:56.840 align:start position:0%
possible to a copy of the quote blue
 
04:55:58.470 --> 04:55:58.480 align:start position:0%
sheet that is the people who just signed
 
04:56:00.150 --> 04:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
up and didn't
 
04:56:02.270 --> 04:56:02.280 align:start position:0%
testify that's a member of the public
 
04:56:04.990 --> 04:56:05.000 align:start position:0%
wants to know that
 
04:56:08.230 --> 04:56:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:11.948 --> 04:56:11.958 align:start position:0%
know but they want a list of the names I
 
04:56:15.548 --> 04:56:15.558 align:start position:0%
guess what else is on the blue
 
04:56:17.830 --> 04:56:17.840 align:start position:0%
sheet it's all they get to say is who
 
04:56:19.030 --> 04:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
they are and whether they support or
 
04:56:19.040 --> 04:56:21.470 align:start position:0%
they are and whether they support or
oppose

04:56:21.470 --> 04:56:21.480 align:start position:0%
oppose
 
04:56:32.270 --> 04:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:32.280 --> 04:56:34.750 align:start position:0%

nope

04:57:07.510 --> 04:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:10.470 --> 04:57:10.480 align:start position:0%
um but I I thought happen if we were
 
04:57:16.350 --> 04:57:16.360 align:start position:0%
going to email that list to Kurt and he
 
04:57:19.190 --> 04:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
was going to submit it into
 
04:57:22.948 --> 04:57:22.958 align:start position:0%
the into the official record so anybody
 
04:57:25.788 --> 04:57:25.798 align:start position:0%
that went to look at the official record
 
04:57:27.830 --> 04:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
would have the list at that
 
04:57:31.350 --> 04:57:31.360 align:start position:0%
time the list of people that testified
 
04:57:34.548 --> 04:57:34.558 align:start position:0%
right but the other list I mean I
 
04:57:36.788 --> 04:57:36.798 align:start position:0%
suppose it's public record but I don't
 
04:57:40.350 --> 04:57:40.360 align:start position:0%
know if because there's phone numbers on
 
04:57:43.230 --> 04:57:43.240 align:start position:0%
there if we should be giving out
 
04:57:45.788 --> 04:57:45.798 align:start position:0%
people's phone numbers just nameing
 
04:57:47.708 --> 04:57:47.718 align:start position:0%
phone number isn't enough to invoke the
 
04:57:51.270 --> 04:57:51.280 align:start position:0%
Privacy yeah I think it other other
 
04:57:52.830 --> 04:57:52.840 align:start position:0%
committees have been releasing the list
 
04:57:54.510 --> 04:57:54.520 align:start position:0%
which is uh what does go in the bill
 
04:57:56.990 --> 04:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
file and the bill files are going to be
 
04:57:58.868 --> 04:57:58.878 align:start position:0%
more readily available going forward in
 
04:58:00.270 --> 04:58:00.280 align:start position:0%
the past when they were
 
04:58:03.470 --> 04:58:03.480 align:start position:0%
just papers but when we sign in in blue
 
04:58:05.548 --> 04:58:05.558 align:start position:0%
sheet in a committee room normally we
 
04:58:09.190 --> 04:58:09.200 align:start position:0%
don't put our phone number down do we no
 
04:58:11.230 --> 04:58:11.240 align:start position:0%
no I don't think phone number should be
 
04:58:12.868 --> 04:58:12.878 align:start position:0%
given out and I don't know if people
 
04:58:14.868 --> 04:58:14.878 align:start position:0%
realizing when they're signing up for
 
04:58:17.990 --> 04:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
that that th those phone numbers may be
 
04:58:20.190 --> 04:58:20.200 align:start position:0%
handed out well the blue sheets are a
 
04:58:22.910 --> 04:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
matter of public record though so if you
 
04:58:25.470 --> 04:58:25.480 align:start position:0%
want to and again what I'm saying is I
 
04:58:27.548 --> 04:58:27.558 align:start position:0%
don't think these people realize that
 
04:58:29.910 --> 04:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
their phone number is being given out I
 
04:58:33.310 --> 04:58:33.320 align:start position:0%
would be furious if it was me yeah I
 
04:58:37.350 --> 04:58:37.360 align:start position:0%
would suggest that you ask um Aaron or
 
04:58:37.360 --> 04:58:38.430 align:start position:0%
would suggest that you ask um Aaron or
Jim

04:58:38.430 --> 04:58:38.440 align:start position:0%
Jim
 
04:58:41.230 --> 04:58:41.240 align:start position:0%
C um
 
04:58:45.510 --> 04:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
before you do anything else yeah because
 
04:58:48.670 --> 04:58:48.680 align:start position:0%
the rules as we know it
 
04:58:48.680 --> 04:58:50.548 align:start position:0%
the rules as we know it
are

04:58:50.548 --> 04:58:50.558 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:58:54.990 --> 04:58:55.000 align:start position:0%
not clear quite I mean what's happening
 
04:58:57.230 --> 04:58:57.240 align:start position:0%
right now I'm not opposed to redacting
 
04:58:58.750 --> 04:58:58.760 align:start position:0%
the phone numbers but I don't want this
 
04:59:00.590 --> 04:59:00.600 align:start position:0%
to become a reason why these things like
 
04:59:02.270 --> 04:59:02.280 align:start position:0%
don't get released for weeks or months
 
04:59:03.628 --> 04:59:03.638 align:start position:0%
so they should be
 
04:59:05.430 --> 04:59:05.440 align:start position:0%
they should be released soon after the
 
04:59:07.190 --> 04:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
hearing and this is something that I
 
04:59:09.150 --> 04:59:09.160 align:start position:0%
believe can easily be accomplished
 
04:59:12.150 --> 04:59:12.160 align:start position:0%
should be accomplished rather than
 
04:59:15.030 --> 04:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
well I know everyone's busy and stuff
 
04:59:17.788 --> 04:59:17.798 align:start position:0%
but but if you look at what we had done
 
04:59:20.948 --> 04:59:20.958 align:start position:0%
outside of this being all digital the
 
04:59:23.390 --> 04:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
blue sheet just went in the folder and
 
04:59:25.030 --> 04:59:25.040 align:start position:0%
went into the permanent record the only
 
04:59:27.350 --> 04:59:27.360 align:start position:0%
time it was ever available somebody
 
04:59:29.110 --> 04:59:29.120 align:start position:0%
would have to go to the
 
04:59:32.708 --> 04:59:32.718 align:start position:0%
office and ask to see the blue sheet
 
04:59:34.070 --> 04:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
well that's correct and I don't think
 
04:59:35.910 --> 04:59:35.920 align:start position:0%
that was a good way to do it even back
 
04:59:37.270 --> 04:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
then it was Antiquated even when I
 
04:59:40.030 --> 04:59:40.040 align:start position:0%
arrived in 2000 December 2008 and it's
 
04:59:41.910 --> 04:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
it's really Antiquated now so now these
 
04:59:44.548 --> 04:59:44.558 align:start position:0%
things do exist in a readily postable
 
04:59:46.110 --> 04:59:46.120 align:start position:0%
form and they should be posted if you
 
04:59:48.670 --> 04:59:48.680 align:start position:0%
want why don't we find out what what the
 
04:59:53.230 --> 04:59:53.240 align:start position:0%
official policy is um in in the
 
05:00:01.948 --> 05:00:01.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:01.958 --> 05:00:04.708 align:start position:0%
 
now

05:00:04.708 --> 05:00:04.718 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:00:16.150 --> 05:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:20.070 --> 05:00:20.080 align:start position:0%
mute the the room I I just unmuted it
 
05:00:21.548 --> 05:00:21.558 align:start position:0%
before I came upstairs but it looks like
 
05:00:24.110 --> 05:00:24.120 align:start position:0%
the room is muted for one reason or
 
05:00:26.430 --> 05:00:26.440 align:start position:0%

House Bill 430 the sidewalk Free Speech
 
05:10:28.910 --> 05:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
act freedom of speech is protected not
 
05:10:31.430 --> 05:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
only by the US Constitution but by the
 
05:10:33.990 --> 05:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Bill of Rights our state
 
05:10:36.030 --> 05:10:36.040 align:start position:0%
constitution is even more adamant than
 
05:10:38.510 --> 05:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
our federal First Amendment part one
 
05:10:41.110 --> 05:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
article 22 says that Free Speech should
 
05:10:44.190 --> 05:10:44.200 align:start position:0%
be inviable preserved yet Free Speech
 
05:10:46.110 --> 05:10:46.120 align:start position:0%
faces growing threats at both the
 
05:10:48.628 --> 05:10:48.638 align:start position:0%
federal and the state level from those
 
05:10:50.788 --> 05:10:50.798 align:start position:0%
who would suppress their opponent speech
 
05:10:52.910 --> 05:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
because they fear losing an open contest
 
05:10:52.920 --> 05:10:53.670 align:start position:0%
because they fear losing an open contest
of

05:10:53.670 --> 05:10:53.680 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:10:55.990 --> 05:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
ideas these threats should be reminders
 
05:10:57.310 --> 05:10:57.320 align:start position:0%
of why the freedom of speech is
 
05:10:58.708 --> 05:10:58.718 align:start position:0%
protected in our
 
05:11:00.830 --> 05:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
constitution Supreme Court Justice
 
05:11:02.910 --> 05:11:02.920 align:start position:0%
William O Douglas won said that freedom
 
05:11:05.788 --> 05:11:05.798 align:start position:0%
of speech May indeed best serve its high
 
05:11:08.030 --> 05:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
purpose when it induces a condition of
 
05:11:11.548 --> 05:11:11.558 align:start position:0%
unrest or even stirs people to anger
 
05:11:13.590 --> 05:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
speech is often provocative and
 
05:11:15.628 --> 05:11:15.638 align:start position:0%
challenging that is why freedom of
 
05:11:17.390 --> 05:11:17.400 align:start position:0%
speech is protected against censorship
 
05:11:20.350 --> 05:11:20.360 align:start position:0%
or punishment abortion is one issue
 
05:11:22.390 --> 05:11:22.400 align:start position:0%
where there is definitely unrest on both
 
05:11:24.670 --> 05:11:24.680 align:start position:0%
sides of the debate but New Hampshire's
 
05:11:26.830 --> 05:11:26.840 align:start position:0%
buffer zone law represents an attempt to
 
05:11:28.470 --> 05:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
stifle the contentious debates
 
05:11:30.070 --> 05:11:30.080 align:start position:0%
surrounding abortion rather than
 
05:11:32.548 --> 05:11:32.558 align:start position:0%
allowing freedom of speech to serve its
 
05:11:35.030 --> 05:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
purpose the buffer zone law allows
 
05:11:38.110 --> 05:11:38.120 align:start position:0%
abortion clinics to demarcate a 25-ft
 
05:11:40.868 --> 05:11:40.878 align:start position:0%
Zone around clinics in which nobody May
 
05:11:43.670 --> 05:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
counsel against or protest against
 
05:11:46.070 --> 05:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
abortion supporters of this buffer zone
 
05:11:48.070 --> 05:11:48.080 align:start position:0%
law might claim that it functions to
 
05:11:49.708 --> 05:11:49.718 align:start position:0%
protect women who are seeking an
 
05:11:51.430 --> 05:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
abortion from being assaulted or
 
05:11:54.708 --> 05:11:54.718 align:start position:0%
harassed but the truth is that assault
 
05:11:56.830 --> 05:11:56.840 align:start position:0%
criminal threatening and harassment are
 
05:11:59.470 --> 05:11:59.480 align:start position:0%
already illegal in New Hampshire the
 
05:12:01.910 --> 05:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
actual effect of the law is to privilege
 
05:12:04.190 --> 05:12:04.200 align:start position:0%
pro-abortion speech and marginalized
 
05:12:07.030 --> 05:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
speech critical of abortion the bill
 
05:12:08.708 --> 05:12:08.718 align:start position:0%
that I have introduced would repeal the
 
05:12:11.030 --> 05:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
buffer zone law yet it should Merit the
 
05:12:13.230 --> 05:12:13.240 align:start position:0%
votes not only of the pro-life or even
 
05:12:15.470 --> 05:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
those who simply Champion Free Speech
 
05:12:17.990 --> 05:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
but all of those who value responsible
 
05:12:20.350 --> 05:12:20.360 align:start position:0%
government that's because in
 
05:12:23.150 --> 05:12:23.160 align:start position:0%
2014 Massachusetts buffer zone law was
 
05:12:25.310 --> 05:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
declared unconstitutional by the US
 
05:12:28.070 --> 05:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court our buffer zone law is
 
05:12:30.628 --> 05:12:30.638 align:start position:0%
identical in all relevant aspects to the
 
05:12:33.350 --> 05:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional Mass Massachusetts law
 
05:12:35.230 --> 05:12:35.240 align:start position:0%
if our buffer zone law is legally
 
05:12:37.990 --> 05:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
challenged it will be repealed and New
 
05:12:39.670 --> 05:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire will have wasted taxpayers
 
05:12:41.910 --> 05:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
money defending a law that is not not
 
05:12:44.948 --> 05:12:44.958 align:start position:0%
only unjust but unconstitutional and
 
05:12:47.830 --> 05:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
futile for all these reasons the buffer
 
05:12:49.830 --> 05:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
Lo Zone law should be
 
05:12:52.470 --> 05:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
repealed thank you for letting me talk
 
05:13:00.390 --> 05:13:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:04.110 --> 05:13:04.120 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative Silber uh
 
05:13:05.788 --> 05:13:05.798 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
05:13:08.390 --> 05:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question if
 
05:13:10.628 --> 05:13:10.638 align:start position:0%
the buffer law is repeal this these
 
05:13:12.910 --> 05:13:12.920 align:start position:0%
sections are repealed uh is it
 
05:13:15.868 --> 05:13:15.878 align:start position:0%
reasonable to expect that the normal
 
05:13:19.350 --> 05:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
police presence could maintain order uh
 
05:13:22.670 --> 05:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
close to these facilities absolutely I
 
05:13:25.390 --> 05:13:25.400 align:start position:0%
mean it already is a law that harassment
 
05:13:28.270 --> 05:13:28.280 align:start position:0%
is illegal so yes
 
05:13:31.708 --> 05:13:31.718 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you thank you
 
05:13:33.910 --> 05:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan did you have a
 
05:13:36.470 --> 05:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
question yeah sure so what was your
 
05:13:37.910 --> 05:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
statement about how this compared to
 
05:13:41.708 --> 05:13:41.718 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts law you I don't did you
 
05:13:44.150 --> 05:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
say literally identical which it is or
 
05:13:45.948 --> 05:13:45.958 align:start position:0%
just mean that it all that it has the
 
05:13:48.470 --> 05:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
same effect even though it was fact
 
05:13:50.590 --> 05:13:50.600 align:start position:0%
written after the McCullen versus K
 
05:13:52.628 --> 05:13:52.638 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court decision was
 
05:13:55.430 --> 05:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
made yeah the fact that um clinics can
 
05:13:56.910 --> 05:13:56.920 align:start position:0%
choose whether or not to activate the
 
05:13:58.910 --> 05:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
law in New Hampshire it just means that
 
05:14:00.628 --> 05:14:00.638 align:start position:0%
the plaintiff's lack standing to
 
05:14:02.948 --> 05:14:02.958 align:start position:0%
challenge it until zone is demarcated by
 
05:14:05.430 --> 05:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
the conditional nature of the Zone has
 
05:14:06.990 --> 05:14:07.000 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with
 
05:14:09.230 --> 05:14:09.240 align:start position:0%
constitutionality so is um is that what
 
05:14:09.240 --> 05:14:10.750 align:start position:0%
constitutionality so is um is that what
you're

05:14:10.750 --> 05:14:10.760 align:start position:0%
you're
 
05:14:14.030 --> 05:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
asking um well pretty much I think
 
05:14:17.788 --> 05:14:17.798 align:start position:0%
that's that I mean that so yeah that's I
 
05:14:19.470 --> 05:14:19.480 align:start position:0%
guess I I understand your answer I mean
 
05:14:23.390 --> 05:14:23.400 align:start position:0%
I just yeah committee when we wrote when
 
05:14:25.628 --> 05:14:25.638 align:start position:0%
we wrote Our version of the bills we um
 
05:14:27.590 --> 05:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
but I'll leave that for the ex session
 
05:14:30.070 --> 05:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
this is not the ex session so okay
 
05:14:33.270 --> 05:14:33.280 align:start position:0%
another question is um how the
 
05:14:35.070 --> 05:14:35.080 align:start position:0%
and you may not have actually been there
 
05:14:36.708 --> 05:14:36.718 align:start position:0%
person but how have the demonstrators
 
05:14:38.590 --> 05:14:38.600 align:start position:0%
have they modified their behavior and
 
05:14:40.070 --> 05:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
what they do in any way to account for
 
05:14:42.390 --> 05:14:42.400 align:start position:0%
the co crisis for the last year or
 
05:14:44.070 --> 05:14:44.080 align:start position:0%
they're just doing the same thing
 
05:14:45.390 --> 05:14:45.400 align:start position:0%
they've been doing for several years
 
05:14:48.350 --> 05:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
before that absolutely I have actually
 
05:14:50.070 --> 05:14:50.080 align:start position:0%
um that's a great question I have been
 
05:14:52.390 --> 05:14:52.400 align:start position:0%
on the sidewalk with the um with the
 
05:14:55.430 --> 05:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
sidewalk counselors and they are keeping
 
05:14:56.910 --> 05:14:56.920 align:start position:0%
their maintaining distance they're
 
05:14:59.190 --> 05:14:59.200 align:start position:0%
maintaining distance from each other um
 
05:15:01.868 --> 05:15:01.878 align:start position:0%
they're very respectful this is in no
 
05:15:06.230 --> 05:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
means um a a loud unrest protest this is
 
05:15:08.190 --> 05:15:08.200 align:start position:0%
a peaceful protest these men and women
 
05:15:11.350 --> 05:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
stand on these sidewalks and they pray
 
05:15:14.190 --> 05:15:14.200 align:start position:0%
and they're very very very peaceful and
 
05:15:15.708 --> 05:15:15.718 align:start position:0%
they're just out there to offer a
 
05:15:18.430 --> 05:15:18.440 align:start position:0%
shoulder to cry on or to offer hope or
 
05:15:21.590 --> 05:15:21.600 align:start position:0%

everybody they're trying to Rebo reboot

the computer system in the room but
 
05:22:03.868 --> 05:22:03.878 align:start position:0%
they're not seeming to have very much
 
05:22:06.948 --> 05:22:06.958 align:start position:0%
success and that's certainly a delay and
 
05:22:09.070 --> 05:22:09.080 align:start position:0%
I apologize to everybody who's out there
 
05:22:11.830 --> 05:22:11.840 align:start position:0%

Kelsey representative
 
05:22:30.548 --> 05:22:30.558 align:start position:0%
Langley thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:22:32.590 --> 05:22:32.600 align:start position:0%
represent restive KY for taking my
 
05:22:35.150 --> 05:22:35.160 align:start position:0%
question um I have a question from my
 
05:22:38.510 --> 05:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
observation of the of the buffer zone I
 
05:22:41.350 --> 05:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
understand how this legislation protects
 
05:22:44.110 --> 05:22:44.120 align:start position:0%
my rights if I were there um as as a
 
05:22:46.670 --> 05:22:46.680 align:start position:0%
demonstrator sharing information what
 
05:22:48.830 --> 05:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
I'm not clear about is how it protects
 
05:22:52.270 --> 05:22:52.280 align:start position:0%
the rights of uh myself if I were there
 
05:22:54.590 --> 05:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
as a patient going into the clinic and
 
05:22:57.030 --> 05:22:57.040 align:start position:0%
was not interested in being in receed of
 
05:22:59.150 --> 05:22:59.160 align:start position:0%
the information being shared can you
 
05:23:01.030 --> 05:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
help me understand that better
 
05:23:02.868 --> 05:23:02.878 align:start position:0%
absolutely that's a great question thank
 
05:23:07.310 --> 05:23:07.320 align:start position:0%
you um so the the law protects the women
 
05:23:10.990 --> 05:23:11.000 align:start position:0%
from um harassment let's be this is not
 
05:23:14.270 --> 05:23:14.280 align:start position:0%
this is not harassment the the sidewalk
 
05:23:18.670 --> 05:23:18.680 align:start position:0%
demonstrators um they stay out of the
 
05:23:21.190 --> 05:23:21.200 align:start position:0%
parking lot they're not anywhere near
 
05:23:23.590 --> 05:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
the um the women that are going into the
 
05:23:26.070 --> 05:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
abortion clinic they are outside of the
 
05:23:29.150 --> 05:23:29.160 align:start position:0%
parking lot there is security at Planned
 
05:23:30.910 --> 05:23:30.920 align:start position:0%
Parenthood they are being protect
 
05:23:33.590 --> 05:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
protected this is a free speech issue
 
05:23:36.830 --> 05:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
though because these people that are on
 
05:23:39.788 --> 05:23:39.798 align:start position:0%
the sidewalk have a right to um to
 
05:23:41.670 --> 05:23:41.680 align:start position:0%
speech and they have a right to
 
05:23:44.150 --> 05:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
peacefully assemble and they're mostly
 
05:23:47.670 --> 05:23:47.680 align:start position:0%
praying and and like I said offering um
 
05:23:49.708 --> 05:23:49.718 align:start position:0%
Alternatives but the right of the women
 
05:23:53.070 --> 05:23:53.080 align:start position:0%
going into the abortion clinics um they
 
05:23:55.868 --> 05:23:55.878 align:start position:0%
also are protected and like I said
 
05:23:57.868 --> 05:23:57.878 align:start position:0%
they're protected under the law from
 
05:24:00.628 --> 05:24:00.638 align:start position:0%
harassment they're not being harassed so
 
05:24:03.270 --> 05:24:03.280 align:start position:0%
I hope that answers your question thank
 
05:24:05.910 --> 05:24:05.920 align:start position:0%

that's Auburn Chester and Sandown uh
 
05:25:41.030 --> 05:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
I've I've been in committee before uh
 
05:25:43.910 --> 05:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
hearing this testimony in a previous
 
05:25:47.230 --> 05:25:47.240 align:start position:0%
life um and one thing that just left me
 
05:25:50.868 --> 05:25:50.878 align:start position:0%
long after we voted on this bill is that
 
05:25:53.230 --> 05:25:53.240 align:start position:0%
as legislators were sworn to uphold the
 
05:25:56.270 --> 05:25:56.280 align:start position:0%
Constitution and the woman's right to uh
 
05:25:58.190 --> 05:25:58.200 align:start position:0%
terminate her pregnancy in the first
 
05:26:01.150 --> 05:26:01.160 align:start position:0%
trimester is a is clearly a
 
05:26:03.350 --> 05:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
constitutionally protected medical
 
05:26:06.470 --> 05:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
procedure one that we should uh do what
 
05:26:08.628 --> 05:26:08.638 align:start position:0%
we need to do to
 
05:26:12.590 --> 05:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
protect um balanced against that is the
 
05:26:15.230 --> 05:26:15.240 align:start position:0%
group that wants to exercise their
 
05:26:17.948 --> 05:26:17.958 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights uh under the First
 
05:26:20.230 --> 05:26:20.240 align:start position:0%
Amendment what we've done to them is
 
05:26:23.628 --> 05:26:23.638 align:start position:0%
we've put them into this weird Catch 22
 
05:26:24.990 --> 05:26:25.000 align:start position:0%
where they can't
 
05:26:28.350 --> 05:26:28.360 align:start position:0%
resolve uh their situation because we
 
05:26:30.948 --> 05:26:30.958 align:start position:0%
have a law on the books that I don't
 
05:26:33.230 --> 05:26:33.240 align:start position:0%
think is identical to what was struck
 
05:26:35.510 --> 05:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
down in Massachusetts but it's really
 
05:26:37.990 --> 05:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
close enough to where if it were ever
 
05:26:41.470 --> 05:26:41.480 align:start position:0%
tested it it it it could easily be
 
05:26:45.190 --> 05:26:45.200 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional um and but yet uh
 
05:26:48.628 --> 05:26:48.638 align:start position:0%
because um these are law-abiding people
 
05:26:51.548 --> 05:26:51.558 align:start position:0%
they've not violated the law and
 
05:26:53.548 --> 05:26:53.558 align:start position:0%
therefore the law has never been
 
05:26:57.390 --> 05:26:57.400 align:start position:0%
enforced and therefore they are not able
 
05:27:01.708 --> 05:27:01.718 align:start position:0%
to um have standing in order to bring
 
05:27:04.270 --> 05:27:04.280 align:start position:0%
forward a case
 
05:27:07.390 --> 05:27:07.400 align:start position:0%
toity so so we've created this just
 
05:27:07.400 --> 05:27:08.708 align:start position:0%
toity so so we've created this just
weird

05:27:08.708 --> 05:27:08.718 align:start position:0%
weird
 
05:27:11.230 --> 05:27:11.240 align:start position:0%
catch22 that just doesn't seem like it's
 
05:27:13.628 --> 05:27:13.638 align:start position:0%
good government I think I think we
 
05:27:17.708 --> 05:27:17.718 align:start position:0%
should um go ahead and remove this law
 
05:27:19.948 --> 05:27:19.958 align:start position:0%
from the books it's not being enforced I
 
05:27:21.708 --> 05:27:21.718 align:start position:0%
mean it's intentionally probably not
 
05:27:24.788 --> 05:27:24.798 align:start position:0%
being enforced but yet it's chilling
 
05:27:27.230 --> 05:27:27.240 align:start position:0%
this the Free Speech rights of a group
 
05:27:30.628 --> 05:27:30.638 align:start position:0%
of people that that are knowable and
 
05:27:33.750 --> 05:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
again I I I do not want to intrude on
 
05:27:36.270 --> 05:27:36.280 align:start position:0%
the rights of the women to receive their
 
05:27:39.670 --> 05:27:39.680 align:start position:0%
medical procedures um because those are
 
05:27:42.070 --> 05:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
constitutionally protected but but fair
 
05:27:44.270 --> 05:27:44.280 align:start position:0%
is fair we should respect everyone's
 
05:27:46.110 --> 05:27:46.120 align:start position:0%
first or respect everyone's
 
05:27:48.070 --> 05:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights I think and
 
05:27:50.830 --> 05:27:50.840 align:start position:0%
getting rid of this law would do that I
 
05:27:53.230 --> 05:27:53.240 align:start position:0%
think I'll take questions if there are
 
05:27:55.670 --> 05:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
any thank you for your testimony are
 
05:27:59.430 --> 05:27:59.440 align:start position:0%

05:29:29.150 --> 05:29:29.160 align:start position:0%
law this statue uh was made law in
 
05:29:32.430 --> 05:29:32.440 align:start position:0%
2014 and and I remember well its passage
 
05:29:36.310 --> 05:29:36.320 align:start position:0%
and also successfully defending this law
 
05:29:38.708 --> 05:29:38.718 align:start position:0%
uh from repeal in
 
05:29:42.070 --> 05:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
2018 the statute stands simply to
 
05:29:44.628 --> 05:29:44.638 align:start position:0%
protect the privacy of patients and
 
05:29:47.230 --> 05:29:47.240 align:start position:0%
caregivers while respecting the freedom
 
05:29:49.708 --> 05:29:49.718 align:start position:0%
of speech for those who are opposed to
 
05:29:53.788 --> 05:29:53.798 align:start position:0%
women seeking Health Care at a facility
 
05:29:57.150 --> 05:29:57.160 align:start position:0%
uh which also provides abortion I just
 
05:30:00.750 --> 05:30:00.760 align:start position:0%
want to make two points very simple
 
05:30:04.270 --> 05:30:04.280 align:start position:0%
uh first of all we need to understand
 
05:30:06.990 --> 05:30:07.000 align:start position:0%
that less than 5% of women's visits to
 
05:30:09.788 --> 05:30:09.798 align:start position:0%
Planned Parenthood clinics or clinics
 
05:30:12.110 --> 05:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
like them who provide abortion
 
05:30:17.070 --> 05:30:17.080 align:start position:0%
care um come for a termination of of
 
05:30:19.788 --> 05:30:19.798 align:start position:0%
pregnancy most women present for
 
05:30:19.798 --> 05:30:21.270 align:start position:0%
pregnancy most women present for
wellness

05:30:21.270 --> 05:30:21.280 align:start position:0%
wellness
 
05:30:23.510 --> 05:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
exams uh Health screenings like
 
05:30:25.190 --> 05:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
mammograms and
 
05:30:28.548 --> 05:30:28.558 align:start position:0%
papsmear and importantly many
 
05:30:32.230 --> 05:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
request uh contracep ction to prevent
 
05:30:35.030 --> 05:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
unplanned and unwanted
 
05:30:38.310 --> 05:30:38.320 align:start position:0%
pregnancies the precipitous drop in
 
05:30:42.150 --> 05:30:42.160 align:start position:0%
abortions in New Hampshire and
 
05:30:45.030 --> 05:30:45.040 align:start position:0%
Nationwide is clearly
 
05:30:50.628 --> 05:30:50.638 align:start position:0%
because uh of improved access to
 
05:30:52.990 --> 05:30:53.000 align:start position:0%
contraception we should celebrate this
 
05:30:55.470 --> 05:30:55.480 align:start position:0%
trend the last thing we want to do is
 
05:30:59.030 --> 05:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
limit education about and access to
 
05:31:01.030 --> 05:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
birth control
 
05:31:05.390 --> 05:31:05.400 align:start position:0%
uh by repealing this buffer zone
 
05:31:09.070 --> 05:31:09.080 align:start position:0%
law now we've heard uh several people
 
05:31:13.070 --> 05:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
say that that these people outside of uh
 
05:31:13.080 --> 05:31:14.548 align:start position:0%
say that that these people outside of uh
these

05:31:14.548 --> 05:31:14.558 align:start position:0%
these
 
05:31:18.750 --> 05:31:18.760 align:start position:0%
clinics um don't prevent
 
05:31:21.350 --> 05:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
access but uh it's very clear to me
 
05:31:24.830 --> 05:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
having talked with many women uh they're
 
05:31:28.310 --> 05:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
an intimidating presence and I know that
 
05:31:31.230 --> 05:31:31.240 align:start position:0%
there are women who come to see me for
 
05:31:34.110 --> 05:31:34.120 align:start position:0%
their care because they don't feel
 
05:31:37.070 --> 05:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
comfortable going to a clinic with a
 
05:31:41.150 --> 05:31:41.160 align:start position:0%
crowd of people around the clinic uh
 
05:31:44.788 --> 05:31:44.798 align:start position:0%
protesting abortion I can't imagine how
 
05:31:48.230 --> 05:31:48.240 align:start position:0%
intimidating it would be if those people
 
05:31:51.470 --> 05:31:51.480 align:start position:0%
were allowed allowed to go closer than
 
05:31:54.110 --> 05:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
the buffer zone uh even on the front
 
05:31:57.948 --> 05:31:57.958 align:start position:0%
steps or in the waiting area um I
 
05:32:00.628 --> 05:32:00.638 align:start position:0%
certainly wouldn't tolerate that you
 
05:32:02.830 --> 05:32:02.840 align:start position:0%
where my office
 
05:32:06.270 --> 05:32:06.280 align:start position:0%
was uh the second point I want to make
 
05:32:08.990 --> 05:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
and sometimes this is misunderstood but
 
05:32:12.548 --> 05:32:12.558 align:start position:0%
the US Supreme Court decision roie
 
05:32:16.110 --> 05:32:16.120 align:start position:0%
Wade handed down 48 years ago was not
 
05:32:18.868 --> 05:32:18.878 align:start position:0%
determined on the premise to protect
 
05:32:20.910 --> 05:32:20.920 align:start position:0%
women's right to
 
05:32:24.110 --> 05:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
choice is often misunderstood It Was
 
05:32:27.830 --> 05:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
Written solely to protect the privacy of
 
05:32:31.470 --> 05:32:31.480 align:start position:0%
the patient caregiver
 
05:32:33.948 --> 05:32:33.958 align:start position:0%
relationship clearly repealing the
 
05:32:37.470 --> 05:32:37.480 align:start position:0%
buffer zone law would jeopardize the
 
05:32:41.150 --> 05:32:41.160 align:start position:0%
sacred privacy which protects patients
 
05:32:44.628 --> 05:32:44.638 align:start position:0%
and providers and even those
 
05:32:50.590 --> 05:32:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:54.150 --> 05:32:54.160 align:start position:0%
Facilities okay I'm happy any any
 
05:32:56.830 --> 05:32:56.840 align:start position:0%
questions you might have for me thank
 
05:32:59.670 --> 05:32:59.680 align:start position:0%
you Dr Young are the questions for Dr
 
05:32:59.680 --> 05:33:02.548 align:start position:0%
you Dr Young are the questions for Dr
Young

05:33:02.548 --> 05:33:02.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:06.190 --> 05:33:06.200 align:start position:0%
yeah I got representative silur yes
 
05:33:07.830 --> 05:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for Mr chairman thank you
 
05:33:09.708 --> 05:33:09.718 align:start position:0%
doctor for taking my question you
 
05:33:12.830 --> 05:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
indicated concern about the repeal of
 
05:33:14.430 --> 05:33:14.440 align:start position:0%
the law would allow people to come into
 
05:33:17.548 --> 05:33:17.558 align:start position:0%
your waiting area uh is there is your
 
05:33:19.270 --> 05:33:19.280 align:start position:0%
waiting area not private is there any
 
05:33:22.070 --> 05:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
reason why uh in a in a private facility
 
05:33:23.590 --> 05:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
you can't control who comes into your
 
05:33:28.270 --> 05:33:28.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:32.590 --> 05:33:32.600 align:start position:0%
not I I would not not invite anyone
 
05:33:37.150 --> 05:33:37.160 align:start position:0%
there who would disrupt the privacy of
 
05:33:39.548 --> 05:33:39.558 align:start position:0%
my relationship with my
 
05:33:43.470 --> 05:33:43.480 align:start position:0%
patients a followup please yes you
 
05:33:47.750 --> 05:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
may I just wondering how you can
 
05:33:51.430 --> 05:33:51.440 align:start position:0%
reconcile your support of maintaining
 
05:33:53.030 --> 05:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
the statute that they're seeking to
 
05:33:56.030 --> 05:33:56.040 align:start position:0%
repeal against the following language
 
05:33:58.948 --> 05:33:58.958 align:start position:0%
Congress shall make no law respecting
 
05:34:00.670 --> 05:34:00.680 align:start position:0%
the right of the people peaceably to
 
05:34:02.510 --> 05:34:02.520 align:start position:0%
assemble which is from the First
 
05:34:04.670 --> 05:34:04.680 align:start position:0%
Amendment and applicable to the states
 
05:34:06.150 --> 05:34:06.160 align:start position:0%
through the 14th Amendment how do you
 
05:34:08.230 --> 05:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
reconcile that with your position on
 
05:34:11.470 --> 05:34:11.480 align:start position:0%
this bill I reconcile it because of the
 
05:34:14.830 --> 05:34:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:17.830 --> 05:34:17.840 align:start position:0%
way I don't I I don't think there should
 
05:34:21.868 --> 05:34:21.878 align:start position:0%
be any disruption of privacy between the
 
05:34:26.270 --> 05:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
relationship my my my my patient and and
 
05:34:28.390 --> 05:34:28.400 align:start position:0%
me as a care
 
05:34:30.788 --> 05:34:30.798 align:start position:0%
provider thank you
 
05:34:30.798 --> 05:34:34.788 align:start position:0%
provider thank you
representative

05:34:34.788 --> 05:34:34.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:37.350 --> 05:34:37.360 align:start position:0%
mlan thank you Mr chair and and thank
 
05:34:40.788 --> 05:34:40.798 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um the uh the
 
05:34:43.310 --> 05:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor on this bill mentioned
 
05:34:45.868 --> 05:34:45.878 align:start position:0%
that um as you said this has been lost
 
05:34:45.878 --> 05:34:46.708 align:start position:0%
that um as you said this has been lost
since

05:34:46.708 --> 05:34:46.718 align:start position:0%
since
 
05:34:49.948 --> 05:34:49.958 align:start position:0%
2014 but in all that time it's it's
 
05:34:53.230 --> 05:34:53.240 align:start position:0%
never been implemented in spite of of
 
05:34:55.270 --> 05:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
the the fact that the proponents say it
 
05:34:58.670 --> 05:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
is so urgently needed and I remember uh
 
05:35:01.350 --> 05:35:01.360 align:start position:0%
the move uh to years ago to repeal the
 
05:35:04.708 --> 05:35:04.718 align:start position:0%
bill and there was a clinic coordinator
 
05:35:07.628 --> 05:35:07.638 align:start position:0%
and I asked her at the time why why have
 
05:35:10.390 --> 05:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
you not implemented it and she said well
 
05:35:12.390 --> 05:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
we're we're close there are certain
 
05:35:14.190 --> 05:35:14.200 align:start position:0%
logistic elements we have to put in
 
05:35:15.948 --> 05:35:15.958 align:start position:0%
place certain conversations we have to
 
05:35:18.310 --> 05:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
have with law enforcement and yet here
 
05:35:21.430 --> 05:35:21.440 align:start position:0%
we are two years later and we still
 
05:35:23.948 --> 05:35:23.958 align:start position:0%
don't see any implementation anywhere in
 
05:35:26.868 --> 05:35:26.878 align:start position:0%
spite of this perceived need so in your
 
05:35:29.390 --> 05:35:29.400 align:start position:0%
role um with the New Hampshire Medical
 
05:35:29.400 --> 05:35:30.350 align:start position:0%
role um with the New Hampshire Medical
Society

05:35:30.350 --> 05:35:30.360 align:start position:0%
Society
 
05:35:32.190 --> 05:35:32.200 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to get some insight as
 
05:35:35.150 --> 05:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
to what your thinking is to why it has
 
05:35:37.708 --> 05:35:37.718 align:start position:0%
not actually been implemented um you
 
05:35:40.350 --> 05:35:40.360 align:start position:0%
know seven years after its
 
05:35:43.030 --> 05:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
passage say that again what what what
 
05:35:45.750 --> 05:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
hasn't been implicated the buffer
 
05:35:50.510 --> 05:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
zone the the the law is in effect but it
 
05:35:52.390 --> 05:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
has not been
 
05:35:55.548 --> 05:35:55.558 align:start position:0%
implemented uh at any facility so no
 
05:35:58.670 --> 05:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
while while facilities have the right to
 
05:36:01.150 --> 05:36:01.160 align:start position:0%
enact this buffers Zone they're not
 
05:36:04.030 --> 05:36:04.040 align:start position:0%
actually doing it and and like I said
 
05:36:06.150 --> 05:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
when I spoke to the clinic coordinator a
 
05:36:08.470 --> 05:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
couple years ago they said well there
 
05:36:10.628 --> 05:36:10.638 align:start position:0%
are logistic issues we have to handle we
 
05:36:12.830 --> 05:36:12.840 align:start position:0%
in conversations with law enforcement so
 
05:36:17.190 --> 05:36:17.200 align:start position:0%
we're close yet we have not had any
 
05:36:19.670 --> 05:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
actual implementation of the buffer zone
 
05:36:21.590 --> 05:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
in the state so as I said I was just
 
05:36:25.190 --> 05:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
wondering in Your Capacity with the New
 
05:36:27.350 --> 05:36:27.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Medical Society in your
 
05:36:30.310 --> 05:36:30.320 align:start position:0%
discussion with your members um do you
 
05:36:33.590 --> 05:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
have any insight as to why that is so
 
05:36:36.788 --> 05:36:36.798 align:start position:0%
you're talking about I'm trying to to
 
05:36:37.750 --> 05:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
understand what you mean by
 
05:36:40.270 --> 05:36:40.280 align:start position:0%
implementation somebody going out there
 
05:36:43.270 --> 05:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
and enforcing the buffer zone is that is
 
05:36:45.350 --> 05:36:45.360 align:start position:0%
that what you're saying it hasn't been
 
05:36:47.628 --> 05:36:47.638 align:start position:0%
implemented it hasn't had to be
 
05:36:51.230 --> 05:36:51.240 align:start position:0%
implemented because I think the law is
 
05:36:53.830 --> 05:36:53.840 align:start position:0%
there uh if somebody sits on the front
 
05:36:56.270 --> 05:36:56.280 align:start position:0%
porch or is in the waiting room I think
 
05:36:58.590 --> 05:36:58.600 align:start position:0%
it would be
 
05:37:01.150 --> 05:37:01.160 align:start position:0%
implemented the buffer zone law is there
 
05:37:04.230 --> 05:37:04.240 align:start position:0%
so that there doesn't have to be force
 
05:37:06.948 --> 05:37:06.958 align:start position:0%
in that situation that's the the last
 
05:37:13.110 --> 05:37:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:18.310 --> 05:37:18.320 align:start position:0%
issue thank you uh representative
 
05:37:21.150 --> 05:37:21.160 align:start position:0%
Alexander um thank you Mr chair and uh
 
05:37:23.390 --> 05:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
thank you doctor for taking my question
 
05:37:25.190 --> 05:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
um I'm really torn on this because we
 
05:37:28.750 --> 05:37:28.760 align:start position:0%
see um precedent for um buffer zones and
 
05:37:30.628 --> 05:37:30.638 align:start position:0%
other areas so talk in the Supreme Court
 
05:37:32.990 --> 05:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
there's a 35- foot buffer zone um
 
05:37:34.390 --> 05:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
outside of a polling location when
 
05:37:36.190 --> 05:37:36.200 align:start position:0%
people go to vote for Representatives
 
05:37:38.350 --> 05:37:38.360 align:start position:0%
like us um there's a 10- foot wide
 
05:37:40.628 --> 05:37:40.638 align:start position:0%
Corridor that's in the uh New Hampshire
 
05:37:45.948 --> 05:37:45.958 align:start position:0%
rsas um this this buffer zone would pres
 
05:37:48.628 --> 05:37:48.638 align:start position:0%
prohibit dis demonstrations for any
 
05:37:51.110 --> 05:37:51.120 align:start position:0%
reason and the speech isn't necessarily
 
05:37:53.548 --> 05:37:53.558 align:start position:0%
or the demonstration is not necessar not
 
05:37:55.628 --> 05:37:55.638 align:start position:0%
specifically targeted so I guess what
 
05:37:58.830 --> 05:37:58.840 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering is maybe so if somebody
 
05:38:00.150 --> 05:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
wanted to
 
05:38:02.788 --> 05:38:02.798 align:start position:0%
protest um the rent in the city of
 
05:38:04.948 --> 05:38:04.958 align:start position:0%
Manchester because it's too high would
 
05:38:07.708 --> 05:38:07.718 align:start position:0%
they be able to stand on the sidewalk
 
05:38:10.110 --> 05:38:10.120 align:start position:0%
right next to the plan Parenthood clinic
 
05:38:10.120 --> 05:38:12.590 align:start position:0%
right next to the plan Parenthood clinic
and

05:38:12.590 --> 05:38:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:16.430 --> 05:38:16.440 align:start position:0%
protest I mean so protesting a different
 
05:38:19.430 --> 05:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
issue than than
 
05:38:21.990 --> 05:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
abortion I I don't know somebody else
 
05:38:24.628 --> 05:38:24.638 align:start position:0%
have to answer that for me I I would
 
05:38:28.830 --> 05:38:28.840 align:start position:0%
think the buffer zone around the uh
 
05:38:33.190 --> 05:38:33.200 align:start position:0%
facility uh stands for for any kind of
 
05:38:37.788 --> 05:38:37.798 align:start position:0%
protest u i mean it's a 25 foot buffer
 
05:38:43.030 --> 05:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
zone so that um well so that we can
 
05:38:43.040 --> 05:38:44.788 align:start position:0%
zone so that um well so that we can
create

05:38:44.788 --> 05:38:44.798 align:start position:0%
create
 
05:38:48.310 --> 05:38:48.320 align:start position:0%
as comfortable environment for clients
 
05:38:50.750 --> 05:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
approaching the facility as as as as
 
05:38:53.190 --> 05:38:53.200 align:start position:0%
there there can be I can tell you even
 
05:38:56.310 --> 05:38:56.320 align:start position:0%
with that 25 foot buffer zone many of
 
05:39:00.350 --> 05:39:00.360 align:start position:0%
women are are uh intimidated by by the
 
05:39:05.310 --> 05:39:05.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:08.670 --> 05:39:08.680 align:start position:0%
sidewalk okay thank you I hopefully if
 
05:39:10.270 --> 05:39:10.280 align:start position:0%
followup Mr chair if somebody else has
 
05:39:12.110 --> 05:39:12.120 align:start position:0%
the answer to this um I'd appreciate
 
05:39:12.120 --> 05:39:13.150 align:start position:0%
the answer to this um I'd appreciate
that

05:39:13.150 --> 05:39:13.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:39:15.590 --> 05:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
answer representative wer you had your

question uh am I muted probably no okay
 
05:39:28.030 --> 05:39:28.040 align:start position:0%
so uh no representative Alexander Mor
 
05:39:30.670 --> 05:39:30.680 align:start position:0%
asked the same question that I had head
 
05:39:33.350 --> 05:39:33.360 align:start position:0%
uh and I don't see any value in pursuing
 
05:39:36.390 --> 05:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
that with Dr Young thank
 
05:39:39.788 --> 05:39:39.798 align:start position:0%

05:40:52.350 --> 05:40:52.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:55.788 --> 05:40:55.798 align:start position:0%
testify are you guys able to hear me we

are all right thank you my name is
 
05:41:00.190 --> 05:41:00.200 align:start position:0%
representative Max abam I'm going to
 
05:41:03.390 --> 05:41:03.400 align:start position:0%
have to speak kind of quickly um because
 
05:41:04.788 --> 05:41:04.798 align:start position:0%
i' I've got another Committee hearing
 
05:41:09.110 --> 05:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
going on at the same time um so this
 
05:41:13.230 --> 05:41:13.240 align:start position:0%
bill was in 2014 or this statute RSA
 
05:41:18.230 --> 05:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
132 sections 37 through 40 um this is
 
05:41:20.910 --> 05:41:20.920 align:start position:0%
based on model legislation in
 
05:41:22.830 --> 05:41:22.840 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts which was implemented in
 
05:41:25.910 --> 05:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts which had a 35t rule and
 
05:41:28.070 --> 05:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
so I've heard a few people saying that
 
05:41:30.070 --> 05:41:30.080 align:start position:0%
it's probably uncon constitutional
 
05:41:32.788 --> 05:41:32.798 align:start position:0%
because theirs was 35 ft and ours is 25
 
05:41:36.310 --> 05:41:36.320 align:start position:0%
ft so we don't know but actually um the
 
05:41:40.230 --> 05:41:40.240 align:start position:0%
US Supreme Court was looking at 23 feet
 
05:41:42.948 --> 05:41:42.958 align:start position:0%
um and if I can pull the exact wording
 
05:41:45.670 --> 05:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
from the decision they said uh in a
 
05:41:47.390 --> 05:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
summary of The Facts the clinic occupies
 
05:41:49.070 --> 05:41:49.080 align:start position:0%
its own building on a street corner its
 
05:41:52.468 --> 05:41:52.478 align:start position:0%
main door is recessed into an open foyer
 
05:41:55.190 --> 05:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
approximately 12T back from the public
 
05:41:56.990 --> 05:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
sidewalk before the Act was amended to
 
05:41:58.708 --> 05:41:58.718 align:start position:0%
create buffer zones petitioners stood
 
05:42:00.310 --> 05:42:00.320 align:start position:0%
near the Entry Way of the
 
05:42:02.948 --> 05:42:02.958 align:start position:0%
foyer now a buffer zone marked by a
 
05:42:05.070 --> 05:42:05.080 align:start position:0%
painted Arc and a sign surrounds the
 
05:42:08.430 --> 05:42:08.440 align:start position:0%
entrance this Zone extends 23 feet down
 
05:42:10.350 --> 05:42:10.360 align:start position:0%
the sidewalk in One Direction and 26
 
05:42:13.110 --> 05:42:13.120 align:start position:0%
feet in the other and outward just one
 
05:42:14.990 --> 05:42:15.000 align:start position:0%
foot short of the curb so they were
 
05:42:17.468 --> 05:42:17.478 align:start position:0%
looking at 23 feet and so the US Supreme
 
05:42:19.510 --> 05:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
Court has already said that 23 feet is
 
05:42:22.430 --> 05:42:22.440 align:start position:0%
is too much they've decided not to get
 
05:42:25.510 --> 05:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
into the middle ground and decide what's
 
05:42:28.788 --> 05:42:28.798 align:start position:0%
an acceptable distance but um they
 
05:42:30.628 --> 05:42:30.638 align:start position:0%
weren't basing this on roie Wade they
 
05:42:32.788 --> 05:42:32.798 align:start position:0%
weren't basing this on an abortion issue
 
05:42:36.030 --> 05:42:36.040 align:start position:0%
they they were basing this um more even
 
05:42:39.948 --> 05:42:39.958 align:start position:0%
than freedom of speech was the idea that
 
05:42:43.310 --> 05:42:43.320 align:start position:0%
one business could not use state law to
 
05:42:45.468 --> 05:42:45.478 align:start position:0%
prevent uh competing
 
05:42:48.990 --> 05:42:49.000 align:start position:0%
business with a competing service from
 
05:42:54.070 --> 05:42:54.080 align:start position:0%
offering an alternative to um potential
 
05:42:57.948 --> 05:42:57.958 align:start position:0%
customers um and so this this statute
 
05:42:59.110 --> 05:42:59.120 align:start position:0%
there's no question that it's
 
05:43:02.390 --> 05:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional as written and there
 
05:43:04.830 --> 05:43:04.840 align:start position:0%
are several problems with just leaving a
 
05:43:06.468 --> 05:43:06.478 align:start position:0%
statute even if it's not currently
 
05:43:08.390 --> 05:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
enforced someone will eventually try to
 
05:43:12.070 --> 05:43:12.080 align:start position:0%
enforce it and be willing to to put
 
05:43:16.670 --> 05:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
their um expose their town to uh costly
 
05:43:19.110 --> 05:43:19.120 align:start position:0%
litigation um one of the problems we ran
 
05:43:21.110 --> 05:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
into on Municipal and County leaving in
 
05:43:23.070 --> 05:43:23.080 align:start position:0%
place laws that were unconstitutional or
 
05:43:24.708 --> 05:43:24.718 align:start position:0%
adding laws that were
 
05:43:27.510 --> 05:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional was that a lot of small
 
05:43:30.788 --> 05:43:30.798 align:start position:0%
towns uh when they look at statutes they
 
05:43:32.430 --> 05:43:32.440 align:start position:0%
have a tendency to assume that they'll
 
05:43:33.910 --> 05:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
they're constitutional and they'll stand
 
05:43:36.788 --> 05:43:36.798 align:start position:0%
up in court and just leaving even a
 
05:43:39.548 --> 05:43:39.558 align:start position:0%
handful of unconstitutional statutes in
 
05:43:43.910 --> 05:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
place creates problems because uh
 
05:43:46.548 --> 05:43:46.558 align:start position:0%
contract law has to be legal you can't
 
05:43:48.910 --> 05:43:48.920 align:start position:0%
have un you can't have illegal contract
 
05:43:50.590 --> 05:43:50.600 align:start position:0%
Provisions you can't have requirements
 
05:43:50.600 --> 05:43:51.830 align:start position:0%
Provisions you can't have requirements
people

05:43:51.830 --> 05:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
people
 
05:43:57.070 --> 05:43:57.080 align:start position:0%
follow um carry out some unlawful act um
 
05:43:59.270 --> 05:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
the signs that they had the municipal
 
05:44:01.548 --> 05:44:01.558 align:start position:0%
have to put up the lines that they have
 
05:44:04.708 --> 05:44:04.718 align:start position:0%
to put up out there um police training
 
05:44:08.190 --> 05:44:08.200 align:start position:0%
frequently and um uh EMT training
 
05:44:11.230 --> 05:44:11.240 align:start position:0%
frequently refers to what's written in
 
05:44:14.070 --> 05:44:14.080 align:start position:0%
rsas um they have to be able to rely on
 
05:44:16.030 --> 05:44:16.040 align:start position:0%
the fact that the rsas that we maintain
 
05:44:18.270 --> 05:44:18.280 align:start position:0%
in the in the law books are valid and
 
05:44:19.670 --> 05:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
are going to hold up in court and aren't
 
05:44:22.708 --> 05:44:22.718 align:start position:0%
going to lead to other problems
 
05:44:25.750 --> 05:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
with uh Free Speech issues Fair Housing
 
05:44:27.510 --> 05:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
Act Americans with Disabilities Act or
 
05:44:32.390 --> 05:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
cause some other uh uh conflict um if
 
05:44:35.190 --> 05:44:35.200 align:start position:0%
every time an elected official at the
 
05:44:37.510 --> 05:44:37.520 align:start position:0%
local level um I serve on my Town's
 
05:44:41.030 --> 05:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
planning board if we have to consult an
 
05:44:42.868 --> 05:44:42.878 align:start position:0%
attorney every time we want to look up a
 
05:44:46.270 --> 05:44:46.280 align:start position:0%
statute it's going to uh drastically
 
05:44:50.628 --> 05:44:50.638 align:start position:0%
increase the cost um we're used to just
 
05:44:54.030 --> 05:44:54.040 align:start position:0%
going to RSA 674 and 676 and some of the
 
05:44:57.190 --> 05:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
others and simply reading those statutes
 
05:44:59.350 --> 05:44:59.360 align:start position:0%
as is on the assumption that it's
 
05:45:01.110 --> 05:45:01.120 align:start position:0%
constitutional and it'll stand up in
 
05:45:03.190 --> 05:45:03.200 align:start position:0%
court so when we make decisions on the
 
05:45:06.510 --> 05:45:06.520 align:start position:0%
planning board or budget committee or
 
05:45:08.628 --> 05:45:08.638 align:start position:0%
anything else we have a tendency to
 
05:45:10.510 --> 05:45:10.520 align:start position:0%
assume that the legislators did their
 
05:45:12.430 --> 05:45:12.440 align:start position:0%
job of of removing anything that might
 
05:45:12.440 --> 05:45:13.510 align:start position:0%
job of of removing anything that might
cause

05:45:13.510 --> 05:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
cause
 
05:45:17.628 --> 05:45:17.638 align:start position:0%
legal uh legal problems later on uh so
 
05:45:19.670 --> 05:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
for that reason I think that we've got
 
05:45:23.270 --> 05:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
to pass this bill and and repeal the
 
05:45:26.190 --> 05:45:26.200 align:start position:0%
statute um we frequently introduce bills
 
05:45:28.548 --> 05:45:28.558 align:start position:0%
to repeal statutes after the courts have
 
05:45:29.868 --> 05:45:29.878 align:start position:0%
ruled something
 
05:45:31.948 --> 05:45:31.958 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and I think it's just
 
05:45:35.150 --> 05:45:35.160 align:start position:0%
it's part of the job
 
05:45:37.548 --> 05:45:37.558 align:start position:0%
um uh of being
 
05:45:40.830 --> 05:45:40.840 align:start position:0%
lawmakers okay thank you thank you for
 
05:45:42.910 --> 05:45:42.920 align:start position:0%
your testimony are there questions for
 
05:45:42.920 --> 05:45:46.190 align:start position:0%
your testimony are there questions for
representative

05:45:46.190 --> 05:45:46.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:48.150 --> 05:45:48.160 align:start position:0%

pulper I like your
 
05:45:53.270 --> 05:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
tie I got the same one
 
05:45:56.548 --> 05:45:56.558 align:start position:0%
on thank you thank you very much thank
 
05:46:03.750 --> 05:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:06.030 --> 05:46:06.040 align:start position:0%
g uh good afternoon members of the House
 
05:46:07.590 --> 05:46:07.600 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee my name is Kayla
 
05:46:08.830 --> 05:46:08.840 align:start position:0%
Montgomery I'm the director of public
 
05:46:10.868 --> 05:46:10.878 align:start position:0%
affairs for PL parent of New Hampshire
 
05:46:12.110 --> 05:46:12.120 align:start position:0%
action fund and pl parent of Northern
 
05:46:14.150 --> 05:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
New England and we oppose house full
 
05:46:16.590 --> 05:46:16.600 align:start position:0%
4:30 uh so first just as some background
 
05:46:18.910 --> 05:46:18.920 align:start position:0%
here uh this body passed Senate Bill 319
 
05:46:20.708 --> 05:46:20.718 align:start position:0%
and it was signed into law back in
 
05:46:23.830 --> 05:46:23.840 align:start position:0%
2014 and this legislation was to address
 
05:46:25.910 --> 05:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
public safety concerns by allowing a
 
05:46:29.868 --> 05:46:29.878 align:start position:0%
non-mandatory buffer zone of up to 25 ft
 
05:46:31.110 --> 05:46:31.120 align:start position:0%
and I just want to stress that it's up
 
05:46:35.190 --> 05:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
to 25t so it could be 5 feet it could be
 
05:46:37.590 --> 05:46:37.600 align:start position:0%
10 feet it could be 25 but this
 
05:46:39.510 --> 05:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
flexibility allows for communities to
 
05:46:41.548 --> 05:46:41.558 align:start position:0%
tailor a Zone in accordance to local
 
05:46:44.310 --> 05:46:44.320 align:start position:0%
factors and local public safety needs so
 
05:46:45.230 --> 05:46:45.240 align:start position:0%
I just want to explain a little bit
 
05:46:47.708 --> 05:46:47.718 align:start position:0%
about why um patients and providers need
 
05:46:50.230 --> 05:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
the flexibility to use a buffer zone
 
05:46:51.468 --> 05:46:51.478 align:start position:0%
reproductive health centers in New
 
05:46:52.910 --> 05:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire have never been free of
 
05:46:54.990 --> 05:46:55.000 align:start position:0%
picketing and protest activity however
 
05:46:56.510 --> 05:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
in the past few years and particularly
 
05:46:58.830 --> 05:46:58.840 align:start position:0%
since the pandemic began the volume and
 
05:47:00.868 --> 05:47:00.878 align:start position:0%
frequency of protesters have increased
 
05:47:03.510 --> 05:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
currently ppnne uses on-site Security on
 
05:47:05.548 --> 05:47:05.558 align:start position:0%
certain days and calls to the police are
 
05:47:08.110 --> 05:47:08.120 align:start position:0%
more frequent these types of har of
 
05:47:09.990 --> 05:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
harassing tactics which have become
 
05:47:12.110 --> 05:47:12.120 align:start position:0%
routine for patients and staff include
 
05:47:13.750 --> 05:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
obstructing the driveway entrance
 
05:47:15.750 --> 05:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
blocking on street parking spaces verbal
 
05:47:17.750 --> 05:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
assaults photographing patients and
 
05:47:19.350 --> 05:47:19.360 align:start position:0%
staff and posting them online to
 
05:47:21.548 --> 05:47:21.558 align:start position:0%
generate further harassment protesters
 
05:47:22.910 --> 05:47:22.920 align:start position:0%
Gather in front of the entrance and
 
05:47:24.990 --> 05:47:25.000 align:start position:0%
create barriers for patients trying to
 
05:47:26.948 --> 05:47:26.958 align:start position:0%
enter the Health Center and they invade
 
05:47:28.708 --> 05:47:28.718 align:start position:0%
the privacy of those who do not wish to
 
05:47:30.548 --> 05:47:30.558 align:start position:0%
engage in dialogue with them while
 
05:47:32.030 --> 05:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
entering or exiting the building and
 
05:47:34.830 --> 05:47:34.840 align:start position:0%
this is a public safety concern so as
 
05:47:37.270 --> 05:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
was already mentioned um buffer zones
 
05:47:39.390 --> 05:47:39.400 align:start position:0%
have been a topic of litigation but as
 
05:47:41.468 --> 05:47:41.478 align:start position:0%
recently as last month the United States
 
05:47:43.190 --> 05:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court upheld a decision by the
 
05:47:45.548 --> 05:47:45.558 align:start position:0%
third uh us Circuit Court of Appeals and
 
05:47:46.948 --> 05:47:46.958 align:start position:0%
left in place a buffer zone in
 
05:47:49.230 --> 05:47:49.240 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh Pennsylvania and as was also
 
05:47:50.990 --> 05:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned locally in
 
05:47:54.070 --> 05:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
2016 uh the US District Court dismissed
 
05:47:55.350 --> 05:47:55.360 align:start position:0%
the challenge to New Hampshire's buffer
 
05:47:57.590 --> 05:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
zone case and it was reaffirmed by the
 
05:48:00.150 --> 05:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
US Circuit Court of Appeals in
 
05:48:03.708 --> 05:48:03.718 align:start position:0%
2017 so establishing a buffer zone is
 
05:48:06.708 --> 05:48:06.718 align:start position:0%
really just one tool in the toolkit for
 
05:48:08.510 --> 05:48:08.520 align:start position:0%
health centers and local authorities to
 
05:48:10.830 --> 05:48:10.840 align:start position:0%
use when working together to protect
 
05:48:12.750 --> 05:48:12.760 align:start position:0%
Public Safety and privacy to patients
 
05:48:15.510 --> 05:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
and providers while also balancing First
 
05:48:17.548 --> 05:48:17.558 align:start position:0%
Amendment rights so while it's not
 
05:48:20.390 --> 05:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
necessarily the first or the only tool
 
05:48:21.990 --> 05:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
Health Centers and communities must have
 
05:48:23.830 --> 05:48:23.840 align:start position:0%
the flexibility to use the buffer zone
 
05:48:26.990 --> 05:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
if needed Public Safety is critical and
 
05:48:29.350 --> 05:48:29.360 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire specific buffer zone law
 
05:48:31.468 --> 05:48:31.478 align:start position:0%
allows patients a safe and private
 
05:48:33.948 --> 05:48:33.958 align:start position:0%
passage to a health center this law is
 
05:48:36.310 --> 05:48:36.320 align:start position:0%
not mandated every reproductive Health
 
05:48:38.110 --> 05:48:38.120 align:start position:0%
Center and every Community faces
 
05:48:40.390 --> 05:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
different concerns this simply gives
 
05:48:42.310 --> 05:48:42.320 align:start position:0%
communities and health centers the
 
05:48:44.708 --> 05:48:44.718 align:start position:0%
flexibility to use the buffer zone to
 
05:48:47.190 --> 05:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
maintain Public Safety as needed no one
 
05:48:49.230 --> 05:48:49.240 align:start position:0%
should face harassment violence or
 
05:48:51.230 --> 05:48:51.240 align:start position:0%
threats when accessing safe legal Health
 
05:48:53.468 --> 05:48:53.478 align:start position:0%
Care everyone from the governor two
 
05:48:56.350 --> 05:48:56.360 align:start position:0%
legislators to patients deserve to feel
 
05:48:58.948 --> 05:48:58.958 align:start position:0%
safe so in conclusion plan Hood
 
05:49:01.030 --> 05:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
recognizes and fully supports the right
 
05:49:03.390 --> 05:49:03.400 align:start position:0%
to Peaceful free speech and having a
 
05:49:05.510 --> 05:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
tool in place to adopt a buffer zone
 
05:49:07.110 --> 05:49:07.120 align:start position:0%
around Health Centers does not remove
 
05:49:09.510 --> 05:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
Free Speech it just gives local Health
 
05:49:11.350 --> 05:49:11.360 align:start position:0%
Centers including patients providers and
 
05:49:14.070 --> 05:49:14.080 align:start position:0%
volunteers a small area of separation
 
05:49:17.110 --> 05:49:17.120 align:start position:0%
for privacy and we urge you to ex exped
 
05:49:19.670 --> 05:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
to legislate house 430 and keep this
 
05:49:22.708 --> 05:49:22.718 align:start position:0%
carefully balanced law um and I also
 
05:49:24.548 --> 05:49:24.558 align:start position:0%
just before I end I'd like to just come
 
05:49:26.468 --> 05:49:26.478 align:start position:0%
back to a question that um
 
05:49:27.750 --> 05:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
representative Langley had for the
 
05:49:30.750 --> 05:49:30.760 align:start position:0%
sponsor about balancing rights um like I
 
05:49:33.070 --> 05:49:33.080 align:start position:0%
said this morning when I mentioned in my
 
05:49:35.590 --> 05:49:35.600 align:start position:0%
testimony that every pregnancy is unique
 
05:49:37.350 --> 05:49:37.360 align:start position:0%
I would say that anyone who comes to
 
05:49:40.590 --> 05:49:40.600 align:start position:0%
plan Parenthood and stands outside of uh
 
05:49:42.788 --> 05:49:42.798 align:start position:0%
the house center is also unique there
 
05:49:46.430 --> 05:49:46.440 align:start position:0%
are people who are very peaceful and
 
05:49:48.350 --> 05:49:48.360 align:start position:0%
there are also some people that aren't
 
05:49:49.868 --> 05:49:49.878 align:start position:0%
and that's why this bill gives us the
 
05:49:52.110 --> 05:49:52.120 align:start position:0%
flexibility when it comes to
 
05:49:54.750 --> 05:49:54.760 align:start position:0%
protections thank you thank you for your
 
05:49:56.990 --> 05:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
testimony representative Sylvia did you
 
05:49:59.990 --> 05:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
have a question yes thank you Mr
 
05:50:01.948 --> 05:50:01.958 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
05:50:05.030 --> 05:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
question you referred to the buffer zone
 
05:50:09.788 --> 05:50:09.798 align:start position:0%
as non-mandatory but in Reading RSA 132
 
05:50:13.708 --> 05:50:13.718 align:start position:0%
col 38 Roman 2 it starts reproductive
 
05:50:15.948 --> 05:50:15.958 align:start position:0%
Health Care Facilities shall clearly
 
05:50:18.070 --> 05:50:18.080 align:start position:0%
demarcate The Zone authorized in
 
05:50:21.708 --> 05:50:21.718 align:start position:0%
paragraph one that doesn't seem to be
 
05:50:23.750 --> 05:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
non-mandatory that seems to be mandatory
 
05:50:27.430 --> 05:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
can you explain your thinking on
 
05:50:27.440 --> 05:50:29.510 align:start position:0%
can you explain your thinking on
that

05:50:29.510 --> 05:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:50:32.110 --> 05:50:32.120 align:start position:0%
um you know I don't have that language
 
05:50:34.190 --> 05:50:34.200 align:start position:0%
in front of me but this bill is not
 
05:50:36.868 --> 05:50:36.878 align:start position:0%
mandatory um the buffer zone is not
 
05:50:39.030 --> 05:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
mandatory every Health Center and every
 
05:50:40.430 --> 05:50:40.440 align:start position:0%
Community is going to face different
 
05:50:42.750 --> 05:50:42.760 align:start position:0%
challenges and some are going to need it
 
05:50:44.708 --> 05:50:44.718 align:start position:0%
and some are not going
 
05:50:50.390 --> 05:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:54.390 --> 05:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
Burch thank you Mr chair and uh thank
 
05:50:58.948 --> 05:50:58.958 align:start position:0%
you uh Miss Montgomery for uh taking my
 
05:51:02.548 --> 05:51:02.558 align:start position:0%
question you you testified that the
 
05:51:04.628 --> 05:51:04.638 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court last
 
05:51:10.510 --> 05:51:10.520 align:start position:0%
month um allowed a uh buffer zone to
 
05:51:12.590 --> 05:51:12.600 align:start position:0%
continue at in
 
05:51:16.350 --> 05:51:16.360 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh uh is it not true that the
 
05:51:19.948 --> 05:51:19.958 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court also last
 
05:51:24.270 --> 05:51:24.280 align:start position:0%
year left in place Chicago's 8 foot
 
05:51:28.030 --> 05:51:28.040 align:start position:0%
floating bubble Zone and harrisburg's 20
 
05:51:30.430 --> 05:51:30.440 align:start position:0%
foot fixed buffer
 
05:51:33.910 --> 05:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
zone that's correct uh not all buffer
 
05:51:35.590 --> 05:51:35.600 align:start position:0%
zones are unconstitutional and we're
 
05:51:39.110 --> 05:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
seeing that thank
 
05:51:44.708 --> 05:51:44.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:47.390 --> 05:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
mlan thank you Mr chair and and thank
 
05:51:49.548 --> 05:51:49.558 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um I just
 
05:51:50.990 --> 05:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
want to follow up a little bit on the
 
05:51:53.590 --> 05:51:53.600 align:start position:0%
same question um I asked Dr Young
 
05:51:54.990 --> 05:51:55.000 align:start position:0%
earlier and maybe you have some
 
05:51:57.390 --> 05:51:57.400 align:start position:0%
additional Insight you make a pretty uh
 
05:51:59.750 --> 05:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
compelling case for the buffer zone as
 
05:52:03.948 --> 05:52:03.958 align:start position:0%
to why it's needed um and yet as as the
 
05:52:07.350 --> 05:52:07.360 align:start position:0%
prime P sponsor said it it it has never
 
05:52:10.230 --> 05:52:10.240 align:start position:0%
been actually implemented you know and
 
05:52:12.270 --> 05:52:12.280 align:start position:0%
given the the compelling need can you
 
05:52:14.990 --> 05:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
maybe give some insight as as to why in
 
05:52:16.910 --> 05:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
the time since the law has been passed
 
05:52:18.830 --> 05:52:18.840 align:start position:0%
it hasn't been
 
05:52:20.788 --> 05:52:20.798 align:start position:0%
implemented sure uh thank you for the
 
05:52:23.910 --> 05:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
question uh as I did mention um Planned
 
05:52:25.750 --> 05:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
Parenthood believes that a buffer zone
 
05:52:28.310 --> 05:52:28.320 align:start position:0%
is just one tool in maintaining public
 
05:52:30.070 --> 05:52:30.080 align:start position:0%
safety and not necessarily again not
 
05:52:32.190 --> 05:52:32.200 align:start position:0%
necessarily the first or the only tool
 
05:52:34.510 --> 05:52:34.520 align:start position:0%
so uh we work with local authorities to
 
05:52:37.270 --> 05:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
review incremental steps and options and
 
05:52:39.628 --> 05:52:39.638 align:start position:0%
new ways to implement mitigation
 
05:52:41.788 --> 05:52:41.798 align:start position:0%
techniques against disruptive protests
 
05:52:45.030 --> 05:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
they take time to implement and uh I
 
05:52:46.468 --> 05:52:46.478 align:start position:0%
think it's really important to note that
 
05:52:48.670 --> 05:52:48.680 align:start position:0%
some of this progress has been
 
05:52:49.868 --> 05:52:49.878 align:start position:0%
understandably delayed while our
 
05:52:51.948 --> 05:52:51.958 align:start position:0%
Manchester Health Center underwent
 
05:52:53.910 --> 05:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
renovations to the building to modernize
 
05:52:56.510 --> 05:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
the space this included um renovations
 
05:52:58.948 --> 05:52:58.958 align:start position:0%
to the parking lot um
 
05:53:01.030 --> 05:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
and this all just wrapped up last month
 
05:53:03.110 --> 05:53:03.120 align:start position:0%
and so we look forward to continuing
 
05:53:05.948 --> 05:53:05.958 align:start position:0%
ongoing discussions about ways to limit
 
05:53:07.788 --> 05:53:07.798 align:start position:0%
dist disruption of protesters with the
 
05:53:10.750 --> 05:53:10.760 align:start position:0%
city stakeholders and I will also add
 
05:53:13.190 --> 05:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
that we have and will continue to have
 
05:53:14.430 --> 05:53:14.440 align:start position:0%
thoughtful communication with
 
05:53:17.030 --> 05:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
Manchester's new police chief and mayor
 
05:53:19.510 --> 05:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
to determine the best course to maintain
 
05:53:21.110 --> 05:53:21.120 align:start position:0%
Public Safety but we need the
 
05:53:25.310 --> 05:53:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:29.070 --> 05:53:29.080 align:start position:0%
so representative Alexander um thank you
 
05:53:31.628 --> 05:53:31.638 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um thank you uh Miss Montgomery
 
05:53:33.468 --> 05:53:33.478 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I just want to
 
05:53:35.628 --> 05:53:35.638 align:start position:0%
follow up on representative McLean's
 
05:53:39.190 --> 05:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
question um so if if um the buffer zone
 
05:53:41.468 --> 05:53:41.478 align:start position:0%
law was repealed in New Hampshire um
 
05:53:44.310 --> 05:53:44.320 align:start position:0%
would Planned Parenthood have um other
 
05:53:47.070 --> 05:53:47.080 align:start position:0%
tools in the toolbox to um make sure the
 
05:53:48.750 --> 05:53:48.760 align:start position:0%
Reproductive Rights of women are
 
05:53:54.628 --> 05:53:54.638 align:start position:0%
protected um in New Hampshire thank
 
05:54:00.390 --> 05:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
you um yes of course but um you know we
 
05:54:02.990 --> 05:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
we do things constantly we've like I
 
05:54:04.910 --> 05:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned we uh work with the Manchester
 
05:54:06.350 --> 05:54:06.360 align:start position:0%
Police Department there have been
 
05:54:07.670 --> 05:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
increased patrolling in the area we've
 
05:54:09.948 --> 05:54:09.958 align:start position:0%
been adding as a hot spot um we continue
 
05:54:12.990 --> 05:54:13.000 align:start position:0%
to engage in these conversations but
 
05:54:14.910 --> 05:54:14.920 align:start position:0%
that doesn't change the fact that the
 
05:54:18.190 --> 05:54:18.200 align:start position:0%
buffer zone is an important tool and
 
05:54:20.430 --> 05:54:20.440 align:start position:0%
whether we use it or whether we don't
 
05:54:24.830 --> 05:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:27.430 --> 05:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
important any other questions for M
 
05:54:27.440 --> 05:54:30.590 align:start position:0%
important any other questions for M
Montgomery

05:54:30.590 --> 05:54:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:32.350 --> 05:54:32.360 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
05:54:34.030 --> 05:54:34.040 align:start position:0%
today thank
 
05:54:45.390 --> 05:54:45.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:47.788 --> 05:54:47.798 align:start position:0%
Jorgenson hi my name is um Beth
 
05:54:50.468 --> 05:54:50.478 align:start position:0%
Jorgenson and I'm uh a resident of
 
05:54:53.868 --> 05:54:53.878 align:start position:0%
Bedford for the last 35 years um I
 
05:54:56.030 --> 05:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
believe that um HB
 
05:55:00.310 --> 05:55:00.320 align:start position:0%
430 uh is a bill that should pass um I
 
05:55:02.830 --> 05:55:02.840 align:start position:0%
personally am one of the folks who go
 
05:55:06.430 --> 05:55:06.440 align:start position:0%
and pray um outside the planed parthood
 
05:55:08.230 --> 05:55:08.240 align:start position:0%
on Penacook Street in Manchester I've
 
05:55:11.070 --> 05:55:11.080 align:start position:0%
been doing that for about 10 years um
 
05:55:14.590 --> 05:55:14.600 align:start position:0%
there are usually maybe five people
 
05:55:18.390 --> 05:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
there sometimes 10 we walk up and down
 
05:55:22.910 --> 05:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
um and we pray and offer pamplets or
 
05:55:27.510 --> 05:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
help to anyone that's going in um the
 
05:55:30.230 --> 05:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
people present are very polite we offer
 
05:55:33.190 --> 05:55:33.200 align:start position:0%
help to anyone you know who's interested
 
05:55:36.030 --> 05:55:36.040 align:start position:0%
and I have never seen any threatening
 
05:55:38.628 --> 05:55:38.638 align:start position:0%
shaming or or anything like that that's
 
05:55:41.190 --> 05:55:41.200 align:start position:0%
disruptive to the people uh that are
 
05:55:44.310 --> 05:55:44.320 align:start position:0%
going in and in regard to their privacy
 
05:55:47.468 --> 05:55:47.478 align:start position:0%
which um the doctor spoke about earlier
 
05:55:49.468 --> 05:55:49.478 align:start position:0%
I really don't understand that because
 
05:55:51.628 --> 05:55:51.638 align:start position:0%
we're folks that are outside they don't
 
05:55:53.628 --> 05:55:53.638 align:start position:0%
know our name we don't know their name
 
05:55:55.910 --> 05:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
and we're not preventing anyone from
 
05:55:59.390 --> 05:55:59.400 align:start position:0%
doing anything all do is stay on the
 
05:56:02.270 --> 05:56:02.280 align:start position:0%
actual side Sidewalk we don't go into
 
05:56:04.350 --> 05:56:04.360 align:start position:0%
the parking lot because that's um
 
05:56:07.070 --> 05:56:07.080 align:start position:0%
private property and no one enters the
 
05:56:09.190 --> 05:56:09.200 align:start position:0%
clinic um and if people don't want to
 
05:56:11.948 --> 05:56:11.958 align:start position:0%
speak with us they just go in and you
 
05:56:13.510 --> 05:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
know that that's
 
05:56:16.590 --> 05:56:16.600 align:start position:0%
fine um as I understand this buffer law
 
05:56:19.110 --> 05:56:19.120 align:start position:0%
would cause us to have to move across
 
05:56:22.030 --> 05:56:22.040 align:start position:0%
the street so that if you wanted to
 
05:56:23.708 --> 05:56:23.718 align:start position:0%
speak with anyone that was walking in
 
05:56:25.628 --> 05:56:25.638 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't be able to you you'd be too
 
05:56:28.750 --> 05:56:28.760 align:start position:0%
far away um and that's basically just
 
05:56:30.230 --> 05:56:30.240 align:start position:0%
what I wanted to let you know that I
 
05:56:32.190 --> 05:56:32.200 align:start position:0%
actually have personal experience going
 
05:56:36.070 --> 05:56:36.080 align:start position:0%
there and you know exercising our our
 
05:56:38.910 --> 05:56:38.920 align:start position:0%
right to peacefully protest and I
 
05:56:41.910 --> 05:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
haven't ever seen you know any any
 
05:56:43.628 --> 05:56:43.638 align:start position:0%
problem where anyone is being I think
 
05:56:45.230 --> 05:56:45.240 align:start position:0%
the word used was
 
05:56:47.910 --> 05:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
harassed um so thank you for letting me
 
05:56:50.628 --> 05:56:50.638 align:start position:0%
speak to this and I would urge you to
 
05:56:54.190 --> 05:56:54.200 align:start position:0%
remove this um this particular law
 
05:56:57.150 --> 05:56:57.160 align:start position:0%
because um it doesn't seem necessary and
 
05:56:58.310 --> 05:56:58.320 align:start position:0%
I think would
 
05:57:00.590 --> 05:57:00.600 align:start position:0%
prevent um those of us who are there
 
05:57:02.788 --> 05:57:02.798 align:start position:0%
peacefully exercising our right to free
 
05:57:05.948 --> 05:57:05.958 align:start position:0%
speech so thank
 
05:57:09.990 --> 05:57:10.000 align:start position:0%

05:57:13.270 --> 05:57:13.280 align:start position:0%

Amendment of the Constitution and the
 
05:58:01.830 --> 05:58:01.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Bill of Rights in part one
 
05:58:04.750 --> 05:58:04.760 align:start position:0%
article 22 citizens have the right to
 
05:58:07.270 --> 05:58:07.280 align:start position:0%

rid of the buffer zone law due to it
 
05:58:09.760 --> 05:58:11.190 align:start position:0%
rid of the buffer zone law due to it
being

05:58:11.190 --> 05:58:11.200 align:start position:0%
being
 
05:58:12.788 --> 05:58:12.798 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional while Planned
 
05:58:15.590 --> 05:58:15.600 align:start position:0%

05:58:18.910 --> 05:58:18.920 align:start position:0%
workers at abortion facilities are
 
05:58:21.670 --> 05:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
scared of are mostly peaceful
 
05:58:23.910 --> 05:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
individuals specifically sidewalk
 
05:58:26.670 --> 05:58:26.680 align:start position:0%
counselors from 40 Days for life and
 
05:58:28.350 --> 05:58:28.360 align:start position:0%
other organizations
 
05:58:29.990 --> 05:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
peacefully standing outside of their
 
05:58:32.270 --> 05:58:32.280 align:start position:0%
establishments and being a listening ear
 
05:58:35.110 --> 05:58:35.120 align:start position:0%
to women in their troubles by providing
 
05:58:37.468 --> 05:58:37.478 align:start position:0%
resources to other pregnancy centers if
 
05:58:37.478 --> 05:58:38.548 align:start position:0%
resources to other pregnancy centers if
they

05:58:38.548 --> 05:58:38.558 align:start position:0%
they
 
05:58:41.270 --> 05:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
ask especially since in the state of New
 
05:58:43.390 --> 05:58:43.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there are twice as many
 
05:58:45.910 --> 05:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
Pregnancy Care Centers in the state
 
05:58:48.230 --> 05:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
compared to abortion facilities
 
05:58:50.948 --> 05:58:50.958 align:start position:0%
including P Planned Parenthood as an
 
05:58:52.670 --> 05:58:52.680 align:start position:0%
African-American woman I have the
 
05:58:54.990 --> 05:58:55.000 align:start position:0%
capacity to advocate for the protection
 
05:58:58.190 --> 05:58:58.200 align:start position:0%
of black women and men specifically I'm
 
05:58:59.910 --> 05:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
advocating for the lives of black
 
05:59:02.230 --> 05:59:02.240 align:start position:0%
mothers and babies because they will be
 
05:59:05.670 --> 05:59:05.680 align:start position:0%
the future generation of black people
 
05:59:07.270 --> 05:59:07.280 align:start position:0%
standing outside of a facility
 
05:59:09.310 --> 05:59:09.320 align:start position:0%
advocating for the protection of black
 
05:59:12.510 --> 05:59:12.520 align:start position:0%
lives within their mother's wombs is no
 
05:59:14.670 --> 05:59:14.680 align:start position:0%
different than people walking across a
 
05:59:17.990 --> 05:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
street to protest police brutality I
 
05:59:20.430 --> 05:59:20.440 align:start position:0%
never promote violence against anyone
 
05:59:22.468 --> 05:59:22.478 align:start position:0%
including the people working at Planned
 
05:59:25.468 --> 05:59:25.478 align:start position:0%
Parenthood and other abortion facilities
 
05:59:28.430 --> 05:59:28.440 align:start position:0%
Kila mon gy mentioned that
 
05:59:30.990 --> 05:59:31.000 align:start position:0%
she has worked with police officers in
 
05:59:35.390 --> 05:59:35.400 align:start position:0%
order to lower lower harassment but I
 
05:59:37.590 --> 05:59:37.600 align:start position:0%
wonder if that's the case then why do we
 
05:59:40.070 --> 05:59:40.080 align:start position:0%
need a buffer law in the first place
 
05:59:42.510 --> 05:59:42.520 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to say is please pass
 
05:59:46.150 --> 05:59:46.160 align:start position:0%
4:30 to protect constitutional freedom
 
05:59:48.230 --> 05:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
in the lives of their future generation
 
05:59:51.110 --> 05:59:51.120 align:start position:0%
of men and women black lives matter and
 
05:59:53.510 --> 05:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
they have always mattered this includes
 
05:59:57.030 --> 05:59:57.040 align:start position:0%
men women born children and pre-born
 
05:59:58.830 --> 05:59:58.840 align:start position:0%
children Planned Parenthood and other
 
06:00:01.670 --> 06:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
facilities and the lives of at a higher
 
06:00:04.548 --> 06:00:04.558 align:start position:0%
rate than white people thank

06:00:18.868 --> 06:00:18.878 align:start position:0%
this incident but there were some
 
06:00:21.230 --> 06:00:21.240 align:start position:0%
antivaccine demonstrators who blocked a
 
06:00:23.910 --> 06:00:23.920 align:start position:0%
site in California so would you would
 
06:00:26.468 --> 06:00:26.478 align:start position:0%
you favor protecting that activity or
 
06:00:29.110 --> 06:00:29.120 align:start position:0%
just activity aimed at preventing this
 
06:00:32.190 --> 06:00:32.200 align:start position:0%
one particular medical procedure are you
 
06:00:35.868 --> 06:00:35.878 align:start position:0%
divorcing in terms of preventing people
 
06:00:39.868 --> 06:00:39.878 align:start position:0%
from getting vaccines as someone who is
 
06:00:42.548 --> 06:00:42.558 align:start position:0%
in the health care field I do believe it
 
06:00:47.948 --> 06:00:47.958 align:start position:0%
is okay for someone to get a vaccine and
 
06:00:51.948 --> 06:00:51.958 align:start position:0%
I think it would be ridiculous for antia
 
06:00:55.190 --> 06:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
to force that onto people who want to
 
06:00:58.150 --> 06:00:58.160 align:start position:0%
get a vaccine but comparing getting a
 
06:01:01.548 --> 06:01:01.558 align:start position:0%
vaccine to a woman getting abortion in
 
06:01:05.390 --> 06:01:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:09.990 --> 06:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:12.070 --> 06:01:12.080 align:start position:0%
isans zingan thank you for your
 
06:01:14.310 --> 06:01:14.320 align:start position:0%

question I did thank you Mr chair I
 
06:01:22.510 --> 06:01:22.520 align:start position:0%
wonder this is this is more curiosity
 
06:01:24.750 --> 06:01:24.760 align:start position:0%
than anything else but I wonder thank
 
06:01:27.110 --> 06:01:27.120 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question do you have
 
06:01:31.190 --> 06:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
any sense of how many women um ask
 
06:01:33.830 --> 06:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
voluntarily ask for information as
 
06:01:35.830 --> 06:01:35.840 align:start position:0%
they're going into a Planned Parenthood
 
06:01:38.750 --> 06:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
facility from demonstrators on the
 
06:01:42.708 --> 06:01:42.718 align:start position:0%
outside do you have any of that well in
 
06:01:42.718 --> 06:01:43.990 align:start position:0%

06:02:15.230 --> 06:02:15.240 align:start position:0%
abortions who have regretted it and if
 
06:02:17.390 --> 06:02:17.400 align:start position:0%
there were people standing outside of
 
06:02:20.430 --> 06:02:20.440 align:start position:0%
the facility offering other options for
 
06:02:23.190 --> 06:02:23.200 align:start position:0%
parenting and for adoption they wouldn't
 
06:02:24.430 --> 06:02:24.440 align:start position:0%

encampment their signs their lack of
 
06:04:15.628 --> 06:04:15.638 align:start position:0%
masks the crowding at the stairway you
 
06:04:18.948 --> 06:04:18.958 align:start position:0%
heard the yelling and bullying of the
 
06:04:22.350 --> 06:04:22.360 align:start position:0%
protesters not all protesters require
 
06:04:24.910 --> 06:04:24.920 align:start position:0%
the equality Health Center to have
 
06:04:27.910 --> 06:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
escorts present some are very peaceful

and they don't interrupt anybody but for
 
06:04:33.990 --> 06:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
past two years every Friday morning a
 
06:04:36.628 --> 06:04:36.638 align:start position:0%
new group has been assembling there and
 
06:04:39.788 --> 06:04:39.798 align:start position:0%
I've been there every Friday morning as
 
06:04:43.390 --> 06:04:43.400 align:start position:0%
well they do a double duty they shame
 
06:04:45.788 --> 06:04:45.798 align:start position:0%
the women and they evangelize their
 
06:04:45.798 --> 06:04:46.910 align:start position:0%
the women and they evangelize their
religious

06:04:46.910 --> 06:04:46.920 align:start position:0%
religious
 
06:04:49.708 --> 06:04:49.718 align:start position:0%
Dogma women are rushing to the doctor
 
06:04:51.868 --> 06:04:51.878 align:start position:0%
appointment they have no interest in
 
06:04:55.270 --> 06:04:55.280 align:start position:0%
hearing a man on the sidewalk a stranger
 
06:04:58.150 --> 06:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
tell her what to do to her body
 
06:04:59.830 --> 06:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
according to his
 
06:05:03.628 --> 06:05:03.638 align:start position:0%
religion the yelling the shaming the
 
06:05:07.390 --> 06:05:07.400 align:start position:0%
intimidating The Graphic Signs the body
 
06:05:10.270 --> 06:05:10.280 align:start position:0%
cameras worn by two of the men that are
 
06:05:13.548 --> 06:05:13.558 align:start position:0%
trained on each of us it's an actual
 
06:05:16.510 --> 06:05:16.520 align:start position:0%
Gauntlet of harassment that the women
 
06:05:20.430 --> 06:05:20.440 align:start position:0%
must run where else does this happen
 
06:05:24.030 --> 06:05:24.040 align:start position:0%
does it happen to you when you go to the
 
06:05:28.430 --> 06:05:28.440 align:start position:0%
doctors a 25- foot buffer has not been
 
06:05:31.628 --> 06:05:31.638 align:start position:0%
enacted but it is a community safety net
 
06:05:35.030 --> 06:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
to keep in place if a clinic chooses to
 
06:05:39.830 --> 06:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
use it for now I am the buffer zone I
 
06:05:43.788 --> 06:05:43.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:45.750 --> 06:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
protesters it's
 
06:05:49.310 --> 06:05:49.320 align:start position:0%
risky I need to stay vigilant but I'm
 
06:05:51.670 --> 06:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
there for the safety of everyone there
 
06:05:53.750 --> 06:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
have been times escorts have had to
 
06:05:56.270 --> 06:05:56.280 align:start position:0%
deescalate potential violence between
 
06:05:58.110 --> 06:05:58.120 align:start position:0%
the patient
 
06:06:01.910 --> 06:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:03.868 --> 06:06:03.878 align:start position:0%
protesters last month we had a
 
06:06:06.110 --> 06:06:06.120 align:start position:0%
considerable snowstorm and the sidewalk
 
06:06:07.708 --> 06:06:07.718 align:start position:0%
got even
 
06:06:10.548 --> 06:06:10.558 align:start position:0%
narrower I let an interpreter into the
 
06:06:13.030 --> 06:06:13.040 align:start position:0%
building and then the non-english
 
06:06:15.468 --> 06:06:15.478 align:start position:0%
speaking patient
 
06:06:18.190 --> 06:06:18.200 align:start position:0%
arrived I went to her and the men
 
06:06:20.708 --> 06:06:20.718 align:start position:0%
started yelling waving their signs
 
06:06:22.750 --> 06:06:22.760 align:start position:0%
leaning in very
 
06:06:25.310 --> 06:06:25.320 align:start position:0%
close I looked at her she looked at me
 
06:06:28.190 --> 06:06:28.200 align:start position:0%
with sheer Terror in her
 
06:06:31.750 --> 06:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
eyes I put an arm around her to hurry
 
06:06:36.270 --> 06:06:36.280 align:start position:0%
her past she was frozen she had fear she
 
06:06:36.280 --> 06:06:37.190 align:start position:0%
her past she was frozen she had fear she
was

06:06:37.190 --> 06:06:37.200 align:start position:0%
was
 
06:06:40.310 --> 06:06:40.320 align:start position:0%
shaking this was a blatant violation of
 
06:06:43.548 --> 06:06:43.558 align:start position:0%
the face act the freedom of access for
 
06:06:47.670 --> 06:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
Clinic entrances it's been engaged since
 
06:06:50.510 --> 06:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
1994 nationally and
 
06:06:53.350 --> 06:06:53.360 align:start position:0%
prohibits someone causing fear for their
 
06:06:55.628 --> 06:06:55.638 align:start position:0%
safety entering a
 
06:07:00.310 --> 06:07:00.320 align:start position:0%
clinic this is is not okay this is
 
06:07:03.110 --> 06:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
dangerous if this were truly a bill that
 
06:07:05.590 --> 06:07:05.600 align:start position:0%
would limit Free Speech I'd be voting
 
06:07:08.270 --> 06:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
against it I've been protesting and
 
06:07:10.590 --> 06:07:10.600 align:start position:0%
demonstrating for the last 55 years of
 
06:07:14.670 --> 06:07:14.680 align:start position:0%
my life but it is not about abortion
 
06:07:16.150 --> 06:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
it's not about
 
06:07:18.910 --> 06:07:18.920 align:start position:0%
religion it's about keeping the First
 
06:07:22.110 --> 06:07:22.120 align:start position:0%
Amendment and Public Safety we can
 
06:07:24.628 --> 06:07:24.638 align:start position:0%
protest and we can have access to a
 
06:07:24.638 --> 06:07:25.910 align:start position:0%
protest and we can have access to a
clinic

06:07:25.910 --> 06:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
clinic
 
06:07:30.030 --> 06:07:30.040 align:start position:0%
simultaneously a 25 foot buffer does not
 
06:07:33.070 --> 06:07:33.080 align:start position:0%
take away the freedom of speech and
 
06:07:35.750 --> 06:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
nowhere are you guaranteed the right to
 
06:07:41.070 --> 06:07:41.080 align:start position:0%
be heard you can speak at in my face 10
 
06:07:45.190 --> 06:07:45.200 align:start position:0%
feet away 25 feet away there is no limit
 
06:07:45.200 --> 06:07:46.150 align:start position:0%
feet away 25 feet away there is no limit
to

06:07:46.150 --> 06:07:46.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:07:48.628 --> 06:07:48.638 align:start position:0%
speech across the country there is a lot
 
06:07:52.150 --> 06:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
of vandalism going on assaults bomb
 
06:07:53.830 --> 06:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
threats at
 
06:07:57.230 --> 06:07:57.240 align:start position:0%
clinics at any given day that Happ could
 
06:07:59.788 --> 06:07:59.798 align:start position:0%
happen in New Hampshire I think we need
 
06:08:02.150 --> 06:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
to keep the buffer zone law in place
 
06:08:03.868 --> 06:08:03.878 align:start position:0%
should the threat
 
06:08:06.628 --> 06:08:06.638 align:start position:0%
arise not all patients and not all
 
06:08:09.670 --> 06:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
clinics are equally vulnerable the
 
06:08:12.110 --> 06:08:12.120 align:start position:0%
physical location of the equality Health
 
06:08:16.708 --> 06:08:16.718 align:start position:0%
Center is very public and close so I
 
06:08:18.948 --> 06:08:18.958 align:start position:0%
hope that you've listened to the
 
06:08:22.468 --> 06:08:22.478 align:start position:0%
protester audio that I sent you I hope
 
06:08:24.750 --> 06:08:24.760 align:start position:0%
you've listened and watched the women
 
06:08:27.350 --> 06:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
who try to enter in our shame
 
06:08:29.948 --> 06:08:29.958 align:start position:0%
and scorned and lectured
 
06:08:32.868 --> 06:08:32.878 align:start position:0%
to but most of all I hope that you will
 
06:08:35.430 --> 06:08:35.440 align:start position:0%

06:09:08.628 --> 06:09:08.638 align:start position:0%
protesters who call because they don't
 
06:09:12.910 --> 06:09:12.920 align:start position:0%

06:09:24.670 --> 06:09:24.680 align:start position:0%
two feet away from me and very often not
 
06:09:27.430 --> 06:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
masked the police officers came and told
 
06:09:29.628 --> 06:09:29.638 align:start position:0%
them to put on masks and to keep their
 
06:09:31.390 --> 06:09:31.400 align:start position:0%
distance they don't distance from each
 
06:09:34.430 --> 06:09:34.440 align:start position:0%
other from us for the patients many
 
06:09:36.548 --> 06:09:36.558 align:start position:0%
times pedestrians coming down the
 
06:09:38.868 --> 06:09:38.878 align:start position:0%
sidewalk walk into the street behind
 
06:09:41.350 --> 06:09:41.360 align:start position:0%
parked cars to avoid them they are a
 
06:09:43.468 --> 06:09:43.478 align:start position:0%
danger to me even when they're not
 
06:09:45.948 --> 06:09:45.958 align:start position:0%
protesting so yes the police have been
 
06:09:47.910 --> 06:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
called many
 
06:09:52.230 --> 06:09:52.240 align:start position:0%
times follow up Mr chairman yes you may
 
06:09:53.830 --> 06:09:53.840 align:start position:0%
but but they haven't no one's been
 
06:09:56.030 --> 06:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
arrested they're only just telling them
 
06:09:59.548 --> 06:09:59.558 align:start position:0%
to keep their distance if if that's the
 
06:10:02.390 --> 06:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
case why aren't you guys um implementing
 
06:10:04.150 --> 06:10:04.160 align:start position:0%
the the buffer
 
06:10:07.510 --> 06:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
zone well that is above my pay grade I'm
 
06:10:10.628 --> 06:10:10.638 align:start position:0%
a volunteer I don't make those decisions
 
06:10:13.150 --> 06:10:13.160 align:start position:0%
but um no there have been no arrest
 
06:10:15.670 --> 06:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
there was a time when one patient's
 
06:10:18.628 --> 06:10:18.638 align:start position:0%
partner was almost arrested because of a
 
06:10:21.190 --> 06:10:21.200 align:start position:0%
violent eruption between the protesters
 
06:10:23.788 --> 06:10:23.798 align:start position:0%
and this man which the escorts
 
06:10:27.150 --> 06:10:27.160 align:start position:0%
de-escalated and stopped um
 
06:10:30.590 --> 06:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
I don't think we want to wait for for
 
06:10:32.788 --> 06:10:32.798 align:start position:0%
arrests and when people talk about it's
 
06:10:35.390 --> 06:10:35.400 align:start position:0%
not harassment well the women going
 
06:10:38.270 --> 06:10:38.280 align:start position:0%
in have already lost a lot of privacy
 
06:10:41.030 --> 06:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
with videos and and audios being taken
 
06:10:44.070 --> 06:10:44.080 align:start position:0%
and published on Facebook a lot of them
 
06:10:46.430 --> 06:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
don't want to know have the public know
 
06:10:48.150 --> 06:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
that they're having an abortion it might
 
06:10:50.750 --> 06:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
be a stigma and for them to press press
 
06:10:52.468 --> 06:10:52.478 align:start position:0%
charges and go to court you're not
 
06:10:55.548 --> 06:10:55.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:55.558 --> 06:10:57.948 align:start position:0%

Manchester for over 15
 
06:12:20.708 --> 06:12:20.718 align:start position:0%
years to offer help and hope and also
 
06:12:24.548 --> 06:12:24.558 align:start position:0%
prayer support to the women going
 
06:12:27.830 --> 06:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
inside although
 
06:12:30.230 --> 06:12:30.240 align:start position:0%
it seems to be not the case in
 
06:12:32.830 --> 06:12:32.840 align:start position:0%
Manchester we are we are very much
 
06:12:36.270 --> 06:12:36.280 align:start position:0%
opposed to any kind of threatening or
 
06:12:39.670 --> 06:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
um disruptive protesting we we maintain
 
06:12:42.788 --> 06:12:42.798 align:start position:0%
a peaceful environment on pentac street
 
06:12:45.310 --> 06:12:45.320 align:start position:0%
of course we don't have any control over
 
06:12:48.430 --> 06:12:48.440 align:start position:0%
anybody who who shows up but um our
 
06:12:50.230 --> 06:12:50.240 align:start position:0%
experience has been for the most part we
 
06:12:52.670 --> 06:12:52.680 align:start position:0%
are peaceful we don't threaten anyone we
 
06:12:55.830 --> 06:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
offer help and if they refuse we just
 
06:12:58.270 --> 06:12:58.280 align:start position:0%
quietly back back off we don't um want
 
06:13:00.628 --> 06:13:00.638 align:start position:0%
to intimidate anybody we're
 
06:13:03.590 --> 06:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
law-abiding and um I'm I'm speaking to
 
06:13:05.390 --> 06:13:05.400 align:start position:0%
say that although this legislation for
 
06:13:07.030 --> 06:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
the buffer zone started out being just
 
06:13:09.510 --> 06:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
about abortion we know this type of
 
06:13:11.948 --> 06:13:11.958 align:start position:0%
legislation will impact all kinds of
 
06:13:14.270 --> 06:13:14.280 align:start position:0%
speech and so I'm asking that we just
 
06:13:16.230 --> 06:13:16.240 align:start position:0%
clean this up so that our first
 
06:13:18.350 --> 06:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
amendment rights basic to our freedoms
 
06:13:20.430 --> 06:13:20.440 align:start position:0%
are protected no matter the content of
 
06:13:20.440 --> 06:13:23.628 align:start position:0%
are protected no matter the content of
the

06:13:23.628 --> 06:13:23.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:26.468 --> 06:13:26.478 align:start position:0%
speech and uh basically that's all
 
06:13:27.788 --> 06:13:27.798 align:start position:0%
wanted to say I want to thank you for
 
06:13:27.798 --> 06:13:28.750 align:start position:0%

and members of the Judiciary Committee
 
06:14:32.948 --> 06:14:32.958 align:start position:0%
my name is Susan Bruce I live in conquer
 
06:14:35.830 --> 06:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
and I'm here to testify in opposition to
 
06:14:38.590 --> 06:14:38.600 align:start position:0%
HB 430 the bill to repeal the buffer
 
06:14:41.948 --> 06:14:41.958 align:start position:0%
zone law this is a bad idea for all of
 
06:14:43.750 --> 06:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's reproductive Health
 
06:14:46.868 --> 06:14:46.878 align:start position:0%
Centers and by the way not all of New
 
06:14:48.990 --> 06:14:49.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's reproductive health centers
 
06:14:52.230 --> 06:14:52.240 align:start position:0%
are affiliated with Planned Parenthood
 
06:14:53.910 --> 06:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
there seems to be a little confusion
 
06:14:56.708 --> 06:14:56.718 align:start position:0%
about that I'm going to speak most I'm
 
06:14:58.468 --> 06:14:58.478 align:start position:0%
going to speak about conquered because I
 
06:15:00.430 --> 06:15:00.440 align:start position:0%
live here and I'm familiar with what
 
06:15:04.270 --> 06:15:04.280 align:start position:0%
happens here and as you heard in earlier
 
06:15:06.350 --> 06:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
testimony here in conquer we have a
 
06:15:08.670 --> 06:15:08.680 align:start position:0%
group of individuals who oppose a
 
06:15:11.310 --> 06:15:11.320 align:start position:0%
woman's right to bodily autonomy and
 
06:15:13.430 --> 06:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
gather every Friday morning to protest
 
06:15:16.070 --> 06:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
in front of the equality Health
 
06:15:19.030 --> 06:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
Center there is very little room between
 
06:15:21.070 --> 06:15:21.080 align:start position:0%
the sidewalk and the stairs that lead up
 
06:15:23.468 --> 06:15:23.478 align:start position:0%
to the center as you can see in the
 
06:15:26.310 --> 06:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
photos that I sent you these are not
 
06:15:29.310 --> 06:15:29.320 align:start position:0%
Pious folk who stand and pray these are
 
06:15:32.788 --> 06:15:32.798 align:start position:0%
not sidewalk counselors unless your idea
 
06:15:35.990 --> 06:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
of counseling involves being bellowed at
 
06:15:39.230 --> 06:15:39.240 align:start position:0%
in the most demeaning and offensive ways
 
06:15:41.150 --> 06:15:41.160 align:start position:0%
these are people who want to shout at
 
06:15:43.948 --> 06:15:43.958 align:start position:0%
and shame women they have no trouble
 
06:15:45.910 --> 06:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
being heard they're fewer than eight
 
06:15:48.670 --> 06:15:48.680 align:start position:0%
feet away from patients they would reach
 
06:15:51.190 --> 06:15:51.200 align:start position:0%
out and grab women or follow them to
 
06:15:53.868 --> 06:15:53.878 align:start position:0%
their cars if they could the only thing
 
06:15:56.990 --> 06:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
that stops them is the escort
 
06:15:59.430 --> 06:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
tell me men of this committee do any of
 
06:16:01.708 --> 06:16:01.718 align:start position:0%
you require escorts to guard you through
 
06:16:04.670 --> 06:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
a shouting throng in order to see your
 
06:16:07.990 --> 06:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
doctor I urge you all to go and witness
 
06:16:10.948 --> 06:16:10.958 align:start position:0%
this for yourselves some Friday morning
 
06:16:12.750 --> 06:16:12.760 align:start position:0%
the protesters are
 
06:16:15.350 --> 06:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
obnoxious the residents and businesses
 
06:16:18.230 --> 06:16:18.240 align:start position:0%
in the area despise them they are so
 
06:16:20.230 --> 06:16:20.240 align:start position:0%
loud that the people who live in the
 
06:16:21.990 --> 06:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
apartment building next door frequently
 
06:16:23.910 --> 06:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
shut out their Windows telling the
 
06:16:26.990 --> 06:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
protesters to shut up pedestrians will
 
06:16:29.590 --> 06:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
walk out into the street around parked
 
06:16:31.708 --> 06:16:31.718 align:start position:0%
cars in order to avoid
 
06:16:34.670 --> 06:16:34.680 align:start position:0%
them the protesters also wear body
 
06:16:37.708 --> 06:16:37.718 align:start position:0%
cameras and videotape the women as they
 
06:16:40.230 --> 06:16:40.240 align:start position:0%
run through the screaming Gauntlet to
 
06:16:42.430 --> 06:16:42.440 align:start position:0%
enter the building in a clear violation
 
06:16:45.868 --> 06:16:45.878 align:start position:0%
of their privacy and they post videos on
 
06:16:49.750 --> 06:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
YouTube all this so that women can
 
06:16:52.830 --> 06:16:52.840 align:start position:0%
access a legal medical procedure the
 
06:16:55.468 --> 06:16:55.478 align:start position:0%
sponsors of this bill have loftily named
 
06:16:58.628 --> 06:16:58.638 align:start position:0%
this the sidewalk Free Speech act I
 
06:17:00.708 --> 06:17:00.718 align:start position:0%
assure you no one is curtailing the free
 
06:17:03.468 --> 06:17:03.478 align:start position:0%
speech of these protesters you may call
 
06:17:05.510 --> 06:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
this Free Speech but it isn't the kind
 
06:17:07.150 --> 06:17:07.160 align:start position:0%
of free speech that any of you would
 
06:17:09.628 --> 06:17:09.638 align:start position:0%
tolerate in your own lives it is
 
06:17:12.190 --> 06:17:12.200 align:start position:0%
harassment it is verbal abuse it is a
 
06:17:15.150 --> 06:17:15.160 align:start position:0%
form of terrorism if someone were doing
 
06:17:17.910 --> 06:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
this to you you would call the police
 
06:17:21.510 --> 06:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
you might even perhaps stand your ground
 
06:17:23.708 --> 06:17:23.718 align:start position:0%
I urge you not to repeal the buffer zone
 
06:17:26.270 --> 06:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
law we all know that it's not used or
 
06:17:29.110 --> 06:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
enforced but it is a symbol the repeal
 
06:17:31.350 --> 06:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
of the bill tells the protesters that
 
06:17:34.830 --> 06:17:34.840 align:start position:0%
it's open season on women's clinics it
 
06:17:36.868 --> 06:17:36.878 align:start position:0%
sends the message that they can already
 
06:17:38.788 --> 06:17:38.798 align:start position:0%
be they can be more vile than they
 
06:17:41.510 --> 06:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
already are it also paves the way for
 
06:17:44.030 --> 06:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
Clinic violence New Hampshire is already
 
06:17:46.708 --> 06:17:46.718 align:start position:0%
home to a number of domestic terrorists
 
06:17:49.270 --> 06:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
and hate groups the white supremacist
 
06:17:51.270 --> 06:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
movement is closely tied to the
 
06:17:54.030 --> 06:17:54.040 align:start position:0%
anti-abortion movement this bill is not

women's fundamental rights and access to

today in opposition to House Bill
 
06:21:43.190 --> 06:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
4:30 we opposed because we believe that
 
06:21:44.628 --> 06:21:44.638 align:start position:0%
women should have access to the full
 
06:21:46.510 --> 06:21:46.520 align:start position:0%
range of reproductive choices and
 
06:21:49.430 --> 06:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
related Health Care coverage and that
 
06:21:51.030 --> 06:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
people should be able to access
 
06:21:53.150 --> 06:21:53.160 align:start position:0%
reproductive and sexual health care
 
06:21:56.310 --> 06:21:56.320 align:start position:0%

06:21:58.548 --> 06:21:58.558 align:start position:0%
idation while I'm here speaking for the
 
06:22:01.110 --> 06:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire women's Foundation I was
 
06:22:03.110 --> 06:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
working as an attorney at planed
 
06:22:06.948 --> 06:22:06.958 align:start position:0%
Parenthood when this law passed earlier
 
06:22:09.468 --> 06:22:09.478 align:start position:0%
uh about eight years ago and so I do
 
06:22:12.070 --> 06:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
have some history and may address a few
 
06:22:14.150 --> 06:22:14.160 align:start position:0%
points that I heard as part of my
 
06:22:16.868 --> 06:22:16.878 align:start position:0%
testimony the New Hampshire PA patient
 
06:22:20.310 --> 06:22:20.320 align:start position:0%
safety law should be upheld uh for the
 
06:22:23.510 --> 06:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
following reasons um in New Hampshire
 
06:22:25.628 --> 06:22:25.638 align:start position:0%
patients should be able to access health
 
06:22:27.868 --> 06:22:27.878 align:start position:0%
care without confrontation or
 
06:22:30.670 --> 06:22:30.680 align:start position:0%
harassment um you've already heard and
 
06:22:33.948 --> 06:22:33.958 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to R my testimony um the
 
06:22:36.230 --> 06:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
compelling stories from representatives
 
06:22:38.510 --> 06:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
from Planned Parenthood as well as from
 
06:22:42.110 --> 06:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
escorts about the type of uh aggressive
 
06:22:44.548 --> 06:22:44.558 align:start position:0%
body language and harsh and abusive
 
06:22:47.510 --> 06:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
verbal language that some patients
 
06:22:50.070 --> 06:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
experience uh while recognizing there
 
06:22:53.590 --> 06:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
are many peaceful and per uh peripheral
 
06:22:56.190 --> 06:22:56.200 align:start position:0%
post uh protesters whose rights need to
 
06:22:59.110 --> 06:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
be accommodated and are addressed uh in
 
06:23:01.910 --> 06:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
the balance that is Incorporated in our
 
06:23:05.110 --> 06:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
current patient safety law this law was
 
06:23:05.120 --> 06:23:06.190 align:start position:0%
current patient safety law this law was
carefully

06:23:06.190 --> 06:23:06.200 align:start position:0%
carefully
 
06:23:09.628 --> 06:23:09.638 align:start position:0%
crafted to be able to meet many
 
06:23:11.948 --> 06:23:11.958 align:start position:0%
constitutional considerations including
 
06:23:14.150 --> 06:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
many that have uh been raised for you
 
06:23:17.350 --> 06:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
here today um several have suggested
 
06:23:19.270 --> 06:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
that this law is so substantially
 
06:23:22.070 --> 06:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
similar to Massachusetts law that it's
 
06:23:23.830 --> 06:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
most certainly
 
06:23:25.468 --> 06:23:25.478 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional um I would sign
 
06:23:27.430 --> 06:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
significantly disagree with that on
 
06:23:30.830 --> 06:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
multiple points um while New Hampshire's
 
06:23:34.390 --> 06:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
law was being drafted uh it was um well
 
06:23:36.788 --> 06:23:36.798 align:start position:0%
aware to the drafters and The Advocates
 
06:23:38.548 --> 06:23:38.558 align:start position:0%
that there were some concerns that the
 
06:23:40.390 --> 06:23:40.400 align:start position:0%
court had raised in the oral argument in
 
06:23:42.948 --> 06:23:42.958 align:start position:0%
the Massachusetts case and this law in
 
06:23:45.468 --> 06:23:45.478 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is specifically crafted to
 
06:23:47.390 --> 06:23:47.400 align:start position:0%
be more narrowly tailored than that
 
06:23:50.750 --> 06:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts law it is not a one-size
 
06:23:53.390 --> 06:23:53.400 align:start position:0%
fits-all uh proposition where every
 
06:23:56.270 --> 06:23:56.280 align:start position:0%
reproductive Health Care uh facility in
 
06:23:58.468 --> 06:23:58.478 align:start position:0%
the state is subject to the same
 
06:24:00.910 --> 06:24:00.920 align:start position:0%
mandatory provision where in the New
 
06:24:02.788 --> 06:24:02.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I mean the Massachusetts law
 
06:24:05.270 --> 06:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
that was struck down um that was one of
 
06:24:07.150 --> 06:24:07.160 align:start position:0%
the concerns that the Supreme Court
 
06:24:10.270 --> 06:24:10.280 align:start position:0%
articulated that there should be no more
 
06:24:12.708 --> 06:24:12.718 align:start position:0%
um assembly or speech restricted than is
 
06:24:15.070 --> 06:24:15.080 align:start position:0%
necessary and therefore when laws and
 
06:24:17.150 --> 06:24:17.160 align:start position:0%
ordinances like this are passed to
 
06:24:19.670 --> 06:24:19.680 align:start position:0%
balance free speech and Public Safety
 
06:24:21.670 --> 06:24:21.680 align:start position:0%
they should be narrowly tailored if
 
06:24:23.750 --> 06:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
possible at the community
 
06:24:26.110 --> 06:24:26.120 align:start position:0%
level um the the other way that New
 
06:24:28.030 --> 06:24:28.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's law is different is it's up
 
06:24:31.510 --> 06:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
to 25 uh feet so as youve heard more
 
06:24:33.150 --> 06:24:33.160 align:start position:0%
recent representative from plan
 
06:24:35.548 --> 06:24:35.558 align:start position:0%
Parenthood testify today there's
 
06:24:42.310 --> 06:24:42.320 align:start position:0%
significant flexibility in how large a
 
06:24:45.150 --> 06:24:45.160 align:start position:0%
z ra your hand the other thing I want to
 
06:24:48.030 --> 06:24:48.040 align:start position:0%
point out because of the suggestion that
 
06:24:50.350 --> 06:24:50.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's law is so similar to
 
06:24:53.628 --> 06:24:53.638 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts that it should surely be
 
06:24:55.548 --> 06:24:55.558 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional is there were
 
06:24:57.350 --> 06:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
plaintiffs including perhaps some of the
 
06:24:59.190 --> 06:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
people who are supporting this repeal
 
06:25:01.430 --> 06:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
who actually brought that case they
 
06:25:03.390 --> 06:25:03.400 align:start position:0%
brought it in the case of ready versus
 
06:25:06.030 --> 06:25:06.040 align:start position:0%
attorney general Joe Foster the very law
 
06:25:09.350 --> 06:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
in front of you was challenged um our
 
06:25:12.070 --> 06:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
own Attorney General's office defended
 
06:25:14.750 --> 06:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
the law and its existence in federal
 
06:25:18.230 --> 06:25:18.240 align:start position:0%
court and while the judge did not have
 
06:25:20.708 --> 06:25:20.718 align:start position:0%
to answer multiple questions because he
 
06:25:22.948 --> 06:25:22.958 align:start position:0%
determined that the plaintiffs did not
 
06:25:25.270 --> 06:25:25.280 align:start position:0%
have standing one of the questions that
 
06:25:28.788 --> 06:25:28.798 align:start position:0%
the judge was asked to answer was is
 
06:25:31.590 --> 06:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
this law facially unconstitutional and
 
06:25:33.590 --> 06:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
what that means in lawyer talk is are
 
06:25:35.910 --> 06:25:35.920 align:start position:0%
there no circumstances under which this
 
06:25:38.310 --> 06:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
law could be applied in a constitutional
 
06:25:41.548 --> 06:25:41.558 align:start position:0%
Manner and the judge did not reach that
 
06:25:43.830 --> 06:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
conclusion and I would think it's very
 
06:25:45.788 --> 06:25:45.798 align:start position:0%
important both for the providers who
 
06:25:48.110 --> 06:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
have advocated today on behalf of their
 
06:25:50.830 --> 06:25:50.840 align:start position:0%
patients about why and how this law is
 
06:25:56.110 --> 06:25:56.120 align:start position:0%
still needed that the committee continue
 
06:25:59.270 --> 06:25:59.280 align:start position:0%
to allow for the flexibility that this
 
06:26:00.990 --> 06:26:01.000 align:start position:0%
uh option provides at the local
 
06:26:04.788 --> 06:26:04.798 align:start position:0%
community level and not feel that it in
 
06:26:07.310 --> 06:26:07.320 align:start position:0%
fact under no circumstances would meet
 
06:26:09.110 --> 06:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
even the current standards of the
 
06:26:11.430 --> 06:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court I also know it was
 
06:26:14.510 --> 06:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned and so I want to emphasize um
 
06:26:17.350 --> 06:26:17.360 align:start position:0%
that just as recently as last month uh
 
06:26:19.590 --> 06:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
the US Supreme Court with its current
 
06:26:23.270 --> 06:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
composition allowed to stand uh 15 foot
 
06:26:26.070 --> 06:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
buffer zone in the city of of Pittsburgh
 
06:26:28.708 --> 06:26:28.718 align:start position:0%
around a reproductive health clinic so
 
06:26:31.590 --> 06:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
there areas that this law might be
 
06:26:33.788 --> 06:26:33.798 align:start position:0%
useful in New Hampshire that could be
 
06:26:36.548 --> 06:26:36.558 align:start position:0%
constitutionally crafted to balance free
 
06:26:39.750 --> 06:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
speech and Public Safety and we would
 
06:26:42.830 --> 06:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
ask you to um continue to leave this law
 
06:26:46.948 --> 06:26:46.958 align:start position:0%
on the books um I did want to raise um a
 
06:26:48.990 --> 06:26:49.000 align:start position:0%
few responses I know representative
 
06:26:51.430 --> 06:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
Alexander had asked a question very
 
06:26:54.270 --> 06:26:54.280 align:start position:0%
specific about statutes that are content
 
06:26:57.510 --> 06:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
neutral as opposed to statutes that
 
06:27:00.430 --> 06:27:00.440 align:start position:0%
address a specific issue or a specific
 
06:27:03.190 --> 06:27:03.200 align:start position:0%
type of speech um and I just wanted to
 
06:27:04.750 --> 06:27:04.760 align:start position:0%
Echo what I think was your own
 
06:27:06.910 --> 06:27:06.920 align:start position:0%
interpretation that this is a Content
 
06:27:10.430 --> 06:27:10.440 align:start position:0%
neutral provision it prohibits any
 
06:27:13.310 --> 06:27:13.320 align:start position:0%
congregating or gathering within a zone
 
06:27:15.350 --> 06:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
that is established it would prohibit
 
06:27:17.750 --> 06:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
people who are uh on the other side of
 
06:27:19.830 --> 06:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
the issue who might be pro-choice or
 
06:27:21.910 --> 06:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
supportive of women from being in that
 
06:27:25.868 --> 06:27:25.878 align:start position:0%
same Zone and courts historic have taken
 
06:27:28.190 --> 06:27:28.200 align:start position:0%
a different perspective on restrictions
 
06:27:31.070 --> 06:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
that implicate speech if in fact they
 
06:27:33.788 --> 06:27:33.798 align:start position:0%
implicate all speech equally um and New
 
06:27:35.708 --> 06:27:35.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's best example is the one that
 
06:27:38.788 --> 06:27:38.798 align:start position:0%
you yourself referenced we have um a
 
06:27:41.590 --> 06:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
statute that protects a certain Zone
 
06:27:43.830 --> 06:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
around New Hampshire's electoral polling
 
06:27:47.430 --> 06:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
places it prohibits all messages for for
 
06:27:50.310 --> 06:27:50.320 align:start position:0%
being delivered in that zone and it does
 
06:27:52.990 --> 06:27:53.000 align:start position:0%
it so that voters can enter and exit
 
06:27:55.910 --> 06:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
freely uh without having
 
06:27:59.510 --> 06:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
proximity or um uh too much interruption
 
06:28:01.190 --> 06:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
in their space or too much interruption
 
06:28:02.390 --> 06:28:02.400 align:start position:0%
in their message and so there are
 
06:28:05.430 --> 06:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
analogies where similar laws like this
 
06:28:07.350 --> 06:28:07.360 align:start position:0%
have been upheld and in fact are being
 
06:28:10.230 --> 06:28:10.240 align:start position:0%
applied in New Hampshire um and so with
 
06:28:14.190 --> 06:28:14.200 align:start position:0%
that as background and um concern for
 
06:28:17.270 --> 06:28:17.280 align:start position:0%
what might happen if in fact this
 
06:28:19.868 --> 06:28:19.878 align:start position:0%
legislature were to send a signal that
 
06:28:22.430 --> 06:28:22.440 align:start position:0%
in fact there is not concern for the
 
06:28:24.350 --> 06:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
type of protesting and the type of
 
06:28:26.628 --> 06:28:26.638 align:start position:0%
balancing that this law takes in place
 
06:28:29.350 --> 06:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
um and we would respectfully ask you to
 
06:28:32.590 --> 06:28:32.600 align:start position:0%
reject House Bill 430 um and urge your
 
06:28:35.468 --> 06:28:35.478 align:start position:0%
focus on laws and policies that will
 
06:28:38.110 --> 06:28:38.120 align:start position:0%
expand Access to Health Care thank you

testifying in favor of House Bill 430
 
06:30:13.628 --> 06:30:13.638 align:start position:0%
which will repeal an unconstitutional
 
06:30:16.030 --> 06:30:16.040 align:start position:0%
law and once again allow free speech on
 
06:30:19.150 --> 06:30:19.160 align:start position:0%
the public sidewalks in New Hampshire
 
06:30:21.670 --> 06:30:21.680 align:start position:0%
most Wednesdays I travel to Manchester
 
06:30:23.310 --> 06:30:23.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to pray on the public
 
06:30:26.350 --> 06:30:26.360 align:start position:0%
sidewalk in front of Planned Parenthood
 
06:30:28.910 --> 06:30:28.920 align:start position:0%
a business engaged primarily in making
 
06:30:32.230 --> 06:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
money aborting babies I pray that women
 
06:30:34.670 --> 06:30:34.680 align:start position:0%
will not get an abortion that day and
 
06:30:37.390 --> 06:30:37.400 align:start position:0%
choose life for their baby instead I
 
06:30:39.468 --> 06:30:39.478 align:start position:0%
usually carry a religious sign with a
 
06:30:42.388 --> 06:30:42.398 align:start position:0%
picture of Our Lady of guad Lupe or a
 
06:30:45.510 --> 06:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
sign that says you hear this stuff God's
 
06:30:48.190 --> 06:30:48.200 align:start position:0%
most precious gift huh rep
 
06:30:50.030 --> 06:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
representative Lang you might want to
 
06:30:53.230 --> 06:30:53.240 align:start position:0%
mute each Wednesday I wonder if this
 
06:30:55.868 --> 06:30:55.878 align:start position:0%
will be the day that the police come and
 
06:30:58.110 --> 06:30:58.120 align:start position:0%
take away our right to pray gather and
 
06:31:00.590 --> 06:31:00.600 align:start position:0%
speak on the public sidewalk by
 
06:31:02.548 --> 06:31:02.558 align:start position:0%
enforcing RSA
 
06:31:05.910 --> 06:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
132 a law tailored for a single line of
 
06:31:08.830 --> 06:31:08.840 align:start position:0%
business in the state only businesses
 
06:31:11.468 --> 06:31:11.478 align:start position:0%
that make money doing abortions but no
 
06:31:14.388 --> 06:31:14.398 align:start position:0%
other businesses it has a chilling
 
06:31:17.830 --> 06:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
effect on First Amendment rights that
 
06:31:19.750 --> 06:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
law doesn't apply to any other business
 
06:31:22.070 --> 06:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire if you end up with a
 
06:31:24.990 --> 06:31:25.000 align:start position:0%
lemon for an automobile you can protest
 
06:31:26.910 --> 06:31:26.920 align:start position:0%
in front of the dealership on the public
 
06:31:29.910 --> 06:31:29.920 align:start position:0%
sidewalk if you dislike a bill proposed
 
06:31:32.190 --> 06:31:32.200 align:start position:0%
by New Hampshire lawmakers you can
 
06:31:34.708 --> 06:31:34.718 align:start position:0%
protest on the public sidewalk you're
 
06:31:37.110 --> 06:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
not under constant threat of fines or
 
06:31:40.830 --> 06:31:40.840 align:start position:0%
arrest like I am when execute exercising
 
06:31:42.990 --> 06:31:43.000 align:start position:0%
my constitutional rights in front of an
 
06:31:43.000 --> 06:31:44.070 align:start position:0%
my constitutional rights in front of an
abortion

06:31:44.070 --> 06:31:44.080 align:start position:0%

06:31:57.868 --> 06:31:57.878 align:start position:0%
in 1968 when I became an officer in the
 
06:32:01.070 --> 06:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
United States Air Force I took an oath
 
06:32:04.548 --> 06:32:04.558 align:start position:0%

favor of House Bill 430 and repeal an
 
06:32:17.430 --> 06:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional statute made
 
06:32:19.830 --> 06:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
exclusively to prevent First Amendment
 
06:32:21.708 --> 06:32:21.718 align:start position:0%
rights on the public sidewalks of New
 
06:32:25.110 --> 06:32:25.120 align:start position:0%

abortion business and ask you once again

that other people may want to speak but
 
06:35:09.510 --> 06:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
there are three left who pre-registered
 
06:35:12.350 --> 06:35:12.360 align:start position:0%
to speak and that's Ian
 
06:35:17.350 --> 06:35:17.360 align:start position:0%
huet uh Jason Hennessy and Delia

06:35:23.398 --> 06:35:32.750 align:start position:0%
 
speak

06:35:32.750 --> 06:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:34.670 --> 06:35:34.680 align:start position:0%
good afternoon can you hear me we can
 
06:35:38.350 --> 06:35:38.360 align:start position:0%
hear you thank you my name is Ian huitt
 
06:35:40.548 --> 06:35:40.558 align:start position:0%
and I'm general counsel at Cornerstone
 
06:35:42.270 --> 06:35:42.280 align:start position:0%
good afternoon and good to see you all
 
06:35:44.628 --> 06:35:44.638 align:start position:0%
again and in addition to being an
 
06:35:46.590 --> 06:35:46.600 align:start position:0%
attorney I've also published academic
 
06:35:48.868 --> 06:35:48.878 align:start position:0%
work on constitutional issues so I'm
 
06:35:51.270 --> 06:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
here to answer any tough legal questions
 
06:35:54.430 --> 06:35:54.440 align:start position:0%
that you have about 4:30 or the
 
06:35:58.110 --> 06:35:58.120 align:start position:0%
constitutionality or lack thereof of RSA
 
06:36:00.350 --> 06:36:00.360 align:start position:0%
13238 and once again I've submitted
 
06:36:02.510 --> 06:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
written testimony but I'd like to make
 
06:36:04.388 --> 06:36:04.398 align:start position:0%
some corrections I think there have been
 
06:36:06.430 --> 06:36:06.440 align:start position:0%
some mischaracterizations and
 
06:36:08.388 --> 06:36:08.398 align:start position:0%
misunderstandings um to an extent even
 
06:36:10.628 --> 06:36:10.638 align:start position:0%
on both sides of the discussion to what
 
06:36:13.150 --> 06:36:13.160 align:start position:0%
the law is first of all the easiest
 
06:36:15.190 --> 06:36:15.200 align:start position:0%
point to address is this issue of coming
 
06:36:18.030 --> 06:36:18.040 align:start position:0%
into the lobby I don't think there's any
 
06:36:19.830 --> 06:36:19.840 align:start position:0%
serious argument to be made that
 
06:36:21.548 --> 06:36:21.558 align:start position:0%
repealing this law would allow people to
 
06:36:23.788 --> 06:36:23.798 align:start position:0%
come into the lobby repealing this law
 
06:36:26.510 --> 06:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
is not going to legalize trespassing or
 
06:36:29.070 --> 06:36:29.080 align:start position:0%
disorderly conduct which are illegal in
 
06:36:31.510 --> 06:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the references we've heard
 
06:36:33.830 --> 06:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
to the Harrisburg and the Pittsburgh
 
06:36:36.628 --> 06:36:36.638 align:start position:0%
cases both of those at the United States
 
06:36:38.830 --> 06:36:38.840 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court level were denials of C
 
06:36:40.830 --> 06:36:40.840 align:start position:0%
tiari which means the Supreme Court just
 
06:36:43.548 --> 06:36:43.558 align:start position:0%
declined to hear the case without
 
06:36:45.510 --> 06:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
addressing the legal issues in the case
 
06:36:47.750 --> 06:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
one way or another the Supreme Court
 
06:36:50.590 --> 06:36:50.600 align:start position:0%
declined sir tiari all the time on all
 
06:36:52.230 --> 06:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
kinds of cases for many different
 
06:36:54.548 --> 06:36:54.558 align:start position:0%
reasons and in fact in a lot of cases
 
06:36:57.190 --> 06:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court will decline sirari in
 
06:36:59.350 --> 06:36:59.360 align:start position:0%
a case that's basically identical to a
 
06:37:01.788 --> 06:37:01.798 align:start position:0%
case it just heard the Supreme Court
 
06:37:03.830 --> 06:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
can't micromanage all the courts in the
 
06:37:06.030 --> 06:37:06.040 align:start position:0%
country so you know this is an
 
06:37:07.830 --> 06:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
understandable mistake I think from from
 
06:37:10.628 --> 06:37:10.638 align:start position:0%
lay people and from the media but I was
 
06:37:12.590 --> 06:37:12.600 align:start position:0%
disappointed to hear an attorney appeal
 
06:37:15.670 --> 06:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
to two denials of Sir tiari as legal
 
06:37:17.628 --> 06:37:17.638 align:start position:0%
arguments and I can assure you that she
 
06:37:19.110 --> 06:37:19.120 align:start position:0%
would not make that argument in New
 
06:37:20.708 --> 06:37:20.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire District Court where it would
 
06:37:22.788 --> 06:37:22.798 align:start position:0%
not be heard as a legal argument I've
 
06:37:24.310 --> 06:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
certainly not practiced in front of a
 
06:37:26.150 --> 06:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
judge that would accept the denial of
 
06:37:28.670 --> 06:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
sirari as if it were somehow binding
 
06:37:31.310 --> 06:37:31.320 align:start position:0%
precedent ready V Foster which is the
 
06:37:33.990 --> 06:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire district court case that
 
06:37:35.628 --> 06:37:35.638 align:start position:0%
case the court was very clear that it
 
06:37:37.708 --> 06:37:37.718 align:start position:0%
was denying the case based on lack of
 
06:37:39.788 --> 06:37:39.798 align:start position:0%
standing the plaintiffs did not have
 
06:37:41.868 --> 06:37:41.878 align:start position:0%
standing because a Zone was demarcated
 
06:37:43.388 --> 06:37:43.398 align:start position:0%
and the district court judge made it
 
06:37:46.070 --> 06:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
clear that if a Zone was demarcated
 
06:37:48.230 --> 06:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
there would be standing I'd encourage
 
06:37:50.150 --> 06:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
you all to just look through that
 
06:37:52.510 --> 06:37:52.520 align:start position:0%
decision to see if there was substantive
 
06:37:54.830 --> 06:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
constitutional analysis and there was
 
06:37:56.750 --> 06:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
not the court did not do the kind of
 
06:37:59.948 --> 06:37:59.958 align:start position:0%
analysis we saw in McCullen B cley which
 
06:38:01.868 --> 06:38:01.878 align:start position:0%
was the Massachusetts case here here's
 
06:38:04.270 --> 06:38:04.280 align:start position:0%
what happened in the Massachusetts case
 
06:38:05.948 --> 06:38:05.958 align:start position:0%
the court found that there's a First
 
06:38:07.990 --> 06:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment right to one-on-one
 
06:38:10.270 --> 06:38:10.280 align:start position:0%
interaction so you don't just have a
 
06:38:12.388 --> 06:38:12.398 align:start position:0%
First Amendment right to protest with
 
06:38:14.788 --> 06:38:14.798 align:start position:0%
signs within sight of the clinic you
 
06:38:16.590 --> 06:38:16.600 align:start position:0%
have a First Amendment right to extend
 
06:38:18.910 --> 06:38:18.920 align:start position:0%
an outstretched arm in Peaceable
 
06:38:21.628 --> 06:38:21.638 align:start position:0%
conversation or to distribute leaflets
 
06:38:23.910 --> 06:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
so that's First Amendment conduct the
 
06:38:25.750 --> 06:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
court Court found the Massachusetts law
 
06:38:27.868 --> 06:38:27.878 align:start position:0%
was content neutral so it applied
 
06:38:30.110 --> 06:38:30.120 align:start position:0%
intermediate scrutiny so it asked does
 
06:38:32.310 --> 06:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
this burden substantially more First
 
06:38:34.190 --> 06:38:34.200 align:start position:0%
Amendment conduct than is necessary for
 
06:38:36.468 --> 06:38:36.478 align:start position:0%
the government's interest and the court
 
06:38:37.708 --> 06:38:37.718 align:start position:0%
went through the different government
 
06:38:39.948 --> 06:38:39.958 align:start position:0%
interests and it said well if they need
 
06:38:42.150 --> 06:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
to prevent harassment they can use laws
 
06:38:44.230 --> 06:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
against harassment or even pass those
 
06:38:46.628 --> 06:38:46.638 align:start position:0%
laws if they don't exist um if there's
 
06:38:48.468 --> 06:38:48.478 align:start position:0%
crowding they can pass laws against
 
06:38:50.948 --> 06:38:50.958 align:start position:0%
crowding they shouldn't be burdening
 
06:38:53.510 --> 06:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
speech so none of that analysis turned
 
06:38:57.510 --> 06:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
at all on whether it was 35 ft or 25 ft
 
06:38:59.388 --> 06:38:59.398 align:start position:0%
and the analysis did not turn on the
 
06:39:02.070 --> 06:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
fact that the clinics in Massachusetts
 
06:39:04.350 --> 06:39:04.360 align:start position:0%
didn't just demarcate these zones at
 
06:39:06.628 --> 06:39:06.638 align:start position:0%
will all those relevant aspects are
 
06:39:09.788 --> 06:39:09.798 align:start position:0%
totally the same in this case and in
 
06:39:12.110 --> 06:39:12.120 align:start position:0%
fact there is one big difference I would
 
06:39:14.670 --> 06:39:14.680 align:start position:0%
say and that is that our law is worse
 
06:39:16.430 --> 06:39:16.440 align:start position:0%
our law has something the Massachusetts
 
06:39:18.628 --> 06:39:18.638 align:start position:0%
law did not have which is a
 
06:39:21.190 --> 06:39:21.200 align:start position:0%
discriminatory carve out for Clinic
 
06:39:23.830 --> 06:39:23.840 align:start position:0%
escorts in the Massachusetts case and
 
06:39:25.510 --> 06:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
I've encourage you all to look at this
 
06:39:27.708 --> 06:39:27.718 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court said it actually
 
06:39:29.948 --> 06:39:29.958 align:start position:0%
counted in favor of Massachusetts
 
06:39:32.548 --> 06:39:32.558 align:start position:0%
argument that their law did not have
 
06:39:34.910 --> 06:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
quote unquote a carve out for the clinic
 
06:39:38.110 --> 06:39:38.120 align:start position:0%
escorts expressly our law does have that
 
06:39:40.430 --> 06:39:40.440 align:start position:0%
and so I think if anything the New
 
06:39:42.150 --> 06:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law would be judged to be
 
06:39:44.510 --> 06:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
content discriminatory not content
 
06:39:47.190 --> 06:39:47.200 align:start position:0%
neutral it could be subject to strict
 
06:39:50.310 --> 06:39:50.320 align:start position:0%
scrutiny and even Massachusetts in Molen
 
06:39:52.510 --> 06:39:52.520 align:start position:0%
did not argue that their law could pass
 
06:39:55.310 --> 06:39:55.320 align:start position:0%
strict scrutiny and of course if not
 
06:39:56.868 --> 06:39:56.878 align:start position:0%
subject to strict scrutiny it'd be
 
06:39:58.628 --> 06:39:58.638 align:start position:0%
subject to intermediate scrutiny and
 
06:40:01.190 --> 06:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
would still lose and I'll take any
 
06:40:04.230 --> 06:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
questions okay are there any questions
 
06:40:07.110 --> 06:40:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:10.708 --> 06:40:10.718 align:start position:0%
hwit yes representative
 
06:40:12.868 --> 06:40:12.878 align:start position:0%
Sylvia thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
06:40:15.310 --> 06:40:15.320 align:start position:0%
Mr hu for taking my question
 
06:40:20.510 --> 06:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
um could you speak to um RSA 132 colon
 
06:40:24.868 --> 06:40:24.878 align:start position:0%
38 uh Roman 2 where it says that
 
06:40:26.510 --> 06:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
reproductive Health Care Facilities
 
06:40:30.430 --> 06:40:30.440 align:start position:0%
shall clearly demarcate the zones uh are
 
06:40:32.788 --> 06:40:32.798 align:start position:0%
are these facilities doing this now I
 
06:40:34.910 --> 06:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
don't think they are and I don't
 
06:40:37.948 --> 06:40:37.958 align:start position:0%
understand why no they excuse me they
 
06:40:40.230 --> 06:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
haven't done that yet if you look uh
 
06:40:42.070 --> 06:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
later on in the statute there's a
 
06:40:44.070 --> 06:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
provision saying that the statute has no
 
06:40:45.948 --> 06:40:45.958 align:start position:0%
effect if a zone is not
 
06:40:48.548 --> 06:40:48.558 align:start position:0%
demarcated so that is an option that the
 
06:40:50.750 --> 06:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
clinics have they are not required to
 
06:40:53.350 --> 06:40:53.360 align:start position:0%
demarcate the Zone if the Zone was was
 
06:40:55.830 --> 06:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
demarcated it would confer standing and
 
06:40:58.150 --> 06:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
there could be a lawsuit um in which
 
06:41:00.350 --> 06:41:00.360 align:start position:0%
this law would be found
 
06:41:03.388 --> 06:41:03.398 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional my suspicion as to why
 
06:41:05.868 --> 06:41:05.878 align:start position:0%
the clinics have not demarcated a Zone
 
06:41:07.750 --> 06:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
and I think this is candidly this is
 
06:41:09.670 --> 06:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
good legal strategy on the part of the
 
06:41:12.110 --> 06:41:12.120 align:start position:0%
clinics attorneys is that keeping this
 
06:41:13.868 --> 06:41:13.878 align:start position:0%
law on the books has something of a
 
06:41:15.830 --> 06:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
chilling effect we've heard I think some
 
06:41:18.430 --> 06:41:18.440 align:start position:0%
indications of that today and actually
 
06:41:20.388 --> 06:41:20.398 align:start position:0%
demarcating the Zone would result in it
 
06:41:22.548 --> 06:41:22.558 align:start position:0%
being challenged and overruled I think
 
06:41:24.430 --> 06:41:24.440 align:start position:0%
if the clinics really have the kinds of
 
06:41:26.590 --> 06:41:26.600 align:start position:0%
interests that we've heard articulated
 
06:41:28.750 --> 06:41:28.760 align:start position:0%
today they would be making use of the
 
06:41:30.590 --> 06:41:30.600 align:start position:0%
Zone they're not making use of it I
 
06:41:32.110 --> 06:41:32.120 align:start position:0%
think because they know that it is
 
06:41:34.548 --> 06:41:34.558 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and would be found
 
06:41:37.670 --> 06:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
uncons thank you are there other
 
06:41:39.510 --> 06:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
questions for Mr
 
06:41:43.628 --> 06:41:43.638 align:start position:0%
huet yes representative Silber yes thank
 
06:41:46.430 --> 06:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you uh Mr hu just uh
 
06:41:49.430 --> 06:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
a little inside baseball question uh
 
06:41:51.670 --> 06:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
isn't it correct that the denial of
 
06:41:54.468 --> 06:41:54.478 align:start position:0%
ciori by the US Supreme Court is not
 
06:41:57.150 --> 06:41:57.160 align:start position:0%
considered precedent and that well over
 
06:41:59.270 --> 06:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
90% of the applications for ciari are
 
06:42:02.150 --> 06:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
denied each year yes that's exactly
 
06:42:03.868 --> 06:42:03.878 align:start position:0%
right I totally agree and and as I
 
06:42:05.310 --> 06:42:05.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier the Supreme Court
 
06:42:09.190 --> 06:42:09.200 align:start position:0%
denies C for many reasons um even cases
 
06:42:11.030 --> 06:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
that are clearly in conflict with
 
06:42:13.910 --> 06:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
President it has just issued and I a
 
06:42:15.990 --> 06:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
major reason is of course that the
 
06:42:18.750 --> 06:42:18.760 align:start position:0%
justices have a limited amount of time
 
06:42:20.468 --> 06:42:20.478 align:start position:0%
we recently saw Chief Justice John
 
06:42:22.548 --> 06:42:22.558 align:start position:0%
Roberts move around circuit assignments
 
06:42:24.708 --> 06:42:24.718 align:start position:0%
because some justices like justice prer
 
06:42:27.510 --> 06:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
were over taxed so they can only do a
 
06:42:28.948 --> 06:42:28.958 align:start position:0%
fin outed amount of work and that
 
06:42:31.830 --> 06:42:31.840 align:start position:0%
accounts for most Niles of C they
 
06:42:34.070 --> 06:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
exactly as you said have no precedential
 
06:42:36.350 --> 06:42:36.360 align:start position:0%
value thank
 
06:42:39.948 --> 06:42:39.958 align:start position:0%
you and representative mlan yeah thank
 
06:42:41.430 --> 06:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thanks for taking my
 
06:42:44.230 --> 06:42:44.240 align:start position:0%
question just um to clarify for me and
 
06:42:46.030 --> 06:42:46.040 align:start position:0%
maybe some of the other non-lawyers on
 
06:42:47.750 --> 06:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
the committee if you could give me a
 
06:42:50.548 --> 06:42:50.558 align:start position:0%
quick executive uh summary of some you
 
06:42:52.070 --> 06:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned some different levels of
 
06:42:55.270 --> 06:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
scrutiny you know based on yeah this is
 
06:42:57.628 --> 06:42:57.638 align:start position:0%
a uh anyways if you could just maybe go
 
06:42:58.830 --> 06:42:58.840 align:start position:0%
through some of those different levels
 
06:43:00.190 --> 06:43:00.200 align:start position:0%
of scrutiny that you were talking about
 
06:43:02.628 --> 06:43:02.638 align:start position:0%
strict scrutiny Etc it would help me
 
06:43:04.670 --> 06:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
understand that a little bit better sure
 
06:43:05.948 --> 06:43:05.958 align:start position:0%
well there's really two levels of
 
06:43:07.708 --> 06:43:07.718 align:start position:0%
scrutiny that are important here the
 
06:43:11.030 --> 06:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts law was subject to a kind
 
06:43:12.868 --> 06:43:12.878 align:start position:0%
of narrow tailoring but you could call
 
06:43:15.708 --> 06:43:15.718 align:start position:0%
it intermediate scrutiny so if a law
 
06:43:18.110 --> 06:43:18.120 align:start position:0%
burdens speech like this law does but
 
06:43:20.388 --> 06:43:20.398 align:start position:0%
the law is content neutral that is it it
 
06:43:22.270 --> 06:43:22.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't discriminate against anyone's
 
06:43:25.590 --> 06:43:25.600 align:start position:0%
particular views then the court will ask
 
06:43:27.750 --> 06:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
well does it burden substantially more
 
06:43:30.030 --> 06:43:30.040 align:start position:0%
speech than is necessary to achieve the
 
06:43:31.670 --> 06:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
government's end so that's what happened
 
06:43:34.350 --> 06:43:34.360 align:start position:0%
in the Massachusetts case um and at
 
06:43:36.230 --> 06:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
least that level of scrutiny would apply
 
06:43:39.388 --> 06:43:39.398 align:start position:0%
in our case now I suggested that the New
 
06:43:42.150 --> 06:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law is content discriminatory
 
06:43:44.590 --> 06:43:44.600 align:start position:0%
because of the carve out for Clinic
 
06:43:47.868 --> 06:43:47.878 align:start position:0%
escorts and a Content discriminatory law
 
06:43:51.110 --> 06:43:51.120 align:start position:0%
is that needs to meet a narrower narrow
 
06:43:52.990 --> 06:43:53.000 align:start position:0%
tailoring standard and the standard
 
06:43:55.590 --> 06:43:55.600 align:start position:0%
there is is it the least restrictive
 
06:43:57.990 --> 06:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
means of satisfying the government's
 
06:43:59.750 --> 06:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
interests and I'll point out that in
 
06:44:03.150 --> 06:44:03.160 align:start position:0%
Molen when asked even Massachusetts did
 
06:44:05.430 --> 06:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
not say that their law could satisfy
 
06:44:07.628 --> 06:44:07.638 align:start position:0%
that level of scrutiny so I don't think
 
06:44:09.948 --> 06:44:09.958 align:start position:0%
there's any question that ours would not
 
06:44:12.110 --> 06:44:12.120 align:start position:0%
either thank
 
06:44:14.670 --> 06:44:14.680 align:start position:0%
you any other
 
06:44:16.910 --> 06:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr
 
06:44:20.430 --> 06:44:20.440 align:start position:0%
huitt thank you and uh next witness
 
06:44:22.548 --> 06:44:22.558 align:start position:0%
would be Jason
 
06:44:22.558 --> 06:44:32.310 align:start position:0%
would be Jason
Hennessy

06:44:32.310 --> 06:44:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:34.750 --> 06:44:34.760 align:start position:0%
hello good afternoon good
 
06:44:36.788 --> 06:44:36.798 align:start position:0%
afternoon hi so my name is Jason
 
06:44:38.708 --> 06:44:38.718 align:start position:0%
Hennessy I'm a resident of amers New
 
06:44:40.910 --> 06:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm also the president of New
 
06:44:42.388 --> 06:44:42.398 align:start position:0%
Hampshire right to life and I'm here to
 
06:44:45.110 --> 06:44:45.120 align:start position:0%
speak in favor of House Bill
 
06:44:47.788 --> 06:44:47.798 align:start position:0%
430 um so I would submit to the to the
 
06:44:49.670 --> 06:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
committee that this bill has very little
 
06:44:52.270 --> 06:44:52.280 align:start position:0%
to do with abortion and much more to do
 
06:44:53.910 --> 06:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
with how our government treats people
 
06:44:55.310 --> 06:44:55.320 align:start position:0%
who are peacefully exercising their
 
06:44:57.948 --> 06:44:57.958 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights on public
 
06:45:00.830 --> 06:45:00.840 align:start position:0%
property um the there's two two major
 
06:45:02.230 --> 06:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights here that are at
 
06:45:04.388 --> 06:45:04.398 align:start position:0%
Play Free Speech which is in the US
 
06:45:06.270 --> 06:45:06.280 align:start position:0%
Constitution First Amendment as well as
 
06:45:08.590 --> 06:45:08.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's uh constitution in
 
06:45:10.670 --> 06:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
article 30 there's also the right to
 
06:45:13.230 --> 06:45:13.240 align:start position:0%
peacefully assemble and that is also in
 
06:45:14.590 --> 06:45:14.600 align:start position:0%
the First Amendment of the Constitution
 
06:45:16.910 --> 06:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
and in article 32 of the New Hampshire
 
06:45:19.030 --> 06:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
Constitution so the question I would ask
 
06:45:20.590 --> 06:45:20.600 align:start position:0%
you is how does it make sense to single
 
06:45:23.788 --> 06:45:23.798 align:start position:0%
out citizens who are pro-life to to qu
 
06:45:26.468 --> 06:45:26.478 align:start position:0%
protected speech and assembly and let me
 
06:45:29.230 --> 06:45:29.240 align:start position:0%
just read you an example uh or the text
 
06:45:34.388 --> 06:45:34.398 align:start position:0%
from the statute of RSA 132 38 it says
 
06:45:36.510 --> 06:45:36.520 align:start position:0%
no congregating
 
06:45:39.030 --> 06:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
patroling picketing or demonstrating
 
06:45:39.040 --> 06:45:39.948 align:start position:0%
patroling picketing or demonstrating
between

06:45:39.948 --> 06:45:39.958 align:start position:0%
between
 
06:45:42.270 --> 06:45:42.280 align:start position:0%
science and so I would just ask you as
 
06:45:45.230 --> 06:45:45.240 align:start position:0%
legislator legisl legislators how does
 
06:45:46.990 --> 06:45:47.000 align:start position:0%
that fit with freedom of speech and
 
06:45:48.910 --> 06:45:48.920 align:start position:0%
freedom of peaceful
 
06:45:51.190 --> 06:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
assembly um and I also want to remind
 
06:45:52.750 --> 06:45:52.760 align:start position:0%
you that we're talking here about public
 
06:45:54.830 --> 06:45:54.840 align:start position:0%
property if this were talking about
 
06:45:56.670 --> 06:45:56.680 align:start position:0%
private property that's an entirely
 
06:45:58.990 --> 06:45:59.000 align:start position:0%
different story but this is public and
 
06:46:00.430 --> 06:46:00.440 align:start position:0%
so why should a private abortion
 
06:46:02.070 --> 06:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
provider be allowed to tell members of
 
06:46:03.990 --> 06:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
the public what they can't say on public
 
06:46:06.110 --> 06:46:06.120 align:start position:0%
property it doesn't make any
 
06:46:09.830 --> 06:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
sense um uh the last part I'll I'll talk
 
06:46:12.468 --> 06:46:12.478 align:start position:0%
about here is that um abortion providers
 
06:46:13.990 --> 06:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
have already told us that they don't
 
06:46:16.110 --> 06:46:16.120 align:start position:0%
want or need this law while their words
 
06:46:18.310 --> 06:46:18.320 align:start position:0%
today say one thing their actions over
 
06:46:19.910 --> 06:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
the last six years tell a completely
 
06:46:22.548 --> 06:46:22.558 align:start position:0%
different story If This Were any sort of
 
06:46:24.388 --> 06:46:24.398 align:start position:0%
issue you would ECT that abortion
 
06:46:25.990 --> 06:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
facilities would will have taken
 
06:46:28.670 --> 06:46:28.680 align:start position:0%
advantage of this law um but they've had
 
06:46:32.270 --> 06:46:32.280 align:start position:0%
six years and they haven't and so um
 
06:46:33.948 --> 06:46:33.958 align:start position:0%
I've heard no argument today that would
 
06:46:35.510 --> 06:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
justify keeping the law in the books and
 
06:46:39.468 --> 06:46:39.478 align:start position:0%
so I ask you to please repeal uh RSA 132

House Bill
 
06:47:36.708 --> 06:47:36.718 align:start position:0%
430 I want to start off with is that I
 
06:47:38.910 --> 06:47:38.920 align:start position:0%
totally wholeheartedly believe in the
 
06:47:41.868 --> 06:47:41.878 align:start position:0%
freedom of speech what I don't believe
 
06:47:44.548 --> 06:47:44.558 align:start position:0%
in is the ability of somebody to stand
 
06:47:46.670 --> 06:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
less than six inches away from your nose
 
06:47:50.150 --> 06:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
and scream at you in front of your face
 
06:47:52.030 --> 06:47:52.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of times the protesters will say
 
06:47:53.750 --> 06:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
to us that the only way can get out
 
06:47:56.708 --> 06:47:56.718 align:start position:0%
their information about people's options
 
06:48:00.190 --> 06:48:00.200 align:start position:0%
are by protesting however as one person
 
06:48:02.750 --> 06:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
previously pointed out we have more
 
06:48:05.510 --> 06:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
Right to Life Pregnancy uh crisis
 
06:48:07.430 --> 06:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
pregnancy centers right to life crisis
 
06:48:09.830 --> 06:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
pregnancy centers in the state of New
 
06:48:12.070 --> 06:48:12.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire then we do hospitals and
 
06:48:15.468 --> 06:48:15.478 align:start position:0%
abortion providers combined so there's
 
06:48:18.030 --> 06:48:18.040 align:start position:0%
plenty of places for people to get their
 
06:48:20.868 --> 06:48:20.878 align:start position:0%
information what I am not wholeheartedly
 
06:48:24.150 --> 06:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
for is the right to have is people's
 
06:48:27.590 --> 06:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
right to go to the doctor to get a a
 
06:48:29.990 --> 06:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
procedure done a legal procedure done
 
06:48:33.190 --> 06:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
and be harassed as they do that no other
 
06:48:35.708 --> 06:48:35.718 align:start position:0%
Medical Offices get protested while
 
06:48:38.270 --> 06:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
trying to perform legal abort legal
 
06:48:41.070 --> 06:48:41.080 align:start position:0%
procedures the same way as reproductive
 
06:48:43.110 --> 06:48:43.120 align:start position:0%
right uh programs
 
06:48:46.110 --> 06:48:46.120 align:start position:0%
do the conquered police department has
 
06:48:50.150 --> 06:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
come to e EHC seven times and since
 
06:48:50.160 --> 06:48:51.350 align:start position:0%
come to e EHC seven times and since
covid

06:48:51.350 --> 06:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
covid
 
06:48:55.590 --> 06:48:55.600 align:start position:0%
started seven times in just over a year
 
06:48:57.910 --> 06:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
and it's basically because people the
 
06:48:59.788 --> 06:48:59.798 align:start position:0%
protesters have refused to maintain
 
06:49:03.230 --> 06:49:03.240 align:start position:0%
distances they've not been wearing masks
 
06:49:05.830 --> 06:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
um they called against one of our dogs
 
06:49:08.030 --> 06:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
one time saying that the dog was
 
06:49:10.430 --> 06:49:10.440 align:start position:0%
harassing them and therefore they wanted
 
06:49:12.830 --> 06:49:12.840 align:start position:0%
the dog that one of the escorts had
 
06:49:15.868 --> 06:49:15.878 align:start position:0%
arrested they are a nuisance not only to
 
06:49:18.110 --> 06:49:18.120 align:start position:0%
our patients but also to the police
 
06:49:20.190 --> 06:49:20.200 align:start position:0%
department with the number of calls that
 
06:49:23.910 --> 06:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
they put into them about what escorts do
 
06:49:25.868 --> 06:49:25.878 align:start position:0%
and about the number of calls we put in
 
06:49:28.788 --> 06:49:28.798 align:start position:0%
because they refuse to obey the law and
 
06:49:30.868 --> 06:49:30.878 align:start position:0%
refuse to obey the mask mandate here in
 
06:49:30.878 --> 06:49:31.948 align:start position:0%
refuse to obey the mask mandate here in
New

06:49:31.948 --> 06:49:31.958 align:start position:0%
New
 
06:49:34.708 --> 06:49:34.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they also take pictures as was
 
06:49:36.830 --> 06:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
said before they take pictures without
 
06:49:39.468 --> 06:49:39.478 align:start position:0%
people's permission and they take videos
 
06:49:41.670 --> 06:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
and post them on YouTube as well as
 
06:49:44.270 --> 06:49:44.280 align:start position:0%
their Facebook pages these are patients
 
06:49:46.468 --> 06:49:46.478 align:start position:0%
that are coming in and out of our
 
06:49:49.190 --> 06:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
facility without their permission these
 
06:49:51.350 --> 06:49:51.360 align:start position:0%
things are being posted and they have no
 
06:49:54.070 --> 06:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
idea why a person may have come into our
 
06:49:56.910 --> 06:49:56.920 align:start position:0%
facility they also post pictures and
 
06:49:58.708 --> 06:49:58.718 align:start position:0%
videos of the people that live in the
 
06:50:01.270 --> 06:50:01.280 align:start position:0%
Kennedy Apartments next door to us
 
06:50:04.750 --> 06:50:04.760 align:start position:0%
people that have mental health issues
 
06:50:06.548 --> 06:50:06.558 align:start position:0%
and that may not understand the
 
06:50:08.628 --> 06:50:08.638 align:start position:0%
convoluted questions that the protesters
 
06:50:12.548 --> 06:50:12.558 align:start position:0%
are asking them end up being then put on
 
06:50:14.990 --> 06:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
video because and being told that
 
06:50:17.510 --> 06:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
they're being silly or how they don't
 
06:50:20.548 --> 06:50:20.558 align:start position:0%
understand what life really is all about
 
06:50:22.030 --> 06:50:22.040 align:start position:0%
because they can't answer that
 
06:50:25.070 --> 06:50:25.080 align:start position:0%
information properly and I apologize my
 
06:50:27.868 --> 06:50:27.878 align:start position:0%
phone is ringing I thought I put it on
 
06:50:30.868 --> 06:50:30.878 align:start position:0%
mute what I'd like to do is talk to you
 
06:50:32.548 --> 06:50:32.558 align:start position:0%
about three different scenarios that
 
06:50:34.230 --> 06:50:34.240 align:start position:0%
just recently happened in front of our
 
06:50:36.948 --> 06:50:36.958 align:start position:0%
facility because a quality Health Center
 
06:50:39.270 --> 06:50:39.280 align:start position:0%
has been in business for almost 50 years
 
06:50:41.030 --> 06:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
providing reproductive health care which
 
06:50:42.510 --> 06:50:42.520 align:start position:0%
includes assisting people getting
 
06:50:45.110 --> 06:50:45.120 align:start position:0%
pregnant as well as terminating
 
06:50:48.190 --> 06:50:48.200 align:start position:0%
pregnancy several months ago we had
 
06:50:49.948 --> 06:50:49.958 align:start position:0%
please imagine yourself this is what
 
06:50:51.430 --> 06:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
happened that several months ago we had
 
06:50:54.708 --> 06:50:54.718 align:start position:0%
a patient sitting in her car with her
 
06:50:57.510 --> 06:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
partner petrified to come inside our
 
06:51:00.030 --> 06:51:00.040 align:start position:0%
facility she wanted to get an ultrasound
 
06:51:02.230 --> 06:51:02.240 align:start position:0%
adjust stational dating ultrasound done
 
06:51:04.388 --> 06:51:04.398 align:start position:0%
because no other facilities in New
 
06:51:07.628 --> 06:51:07.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire were doing gational dating at
 
06:51:09.590 --> 06:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
that time because of covid it was
 
06:51:12.510 --> 06:51:12.520 align:start position:0%
considered an unnecessary procedure
 
06:51:14.590 --> 06:51:14.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to come in just to make sure
 
06:51:16.788 --> 06:51:16.798 align:start position:0%
where they were at to be able to go to
 
06:51:19.670 --> 06:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
the doctors to an OB later because OBS
 
06:51:21.430 --> 06:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
were not doing gestational dating at
 
06:51:23.628 --> 06:51:23.638 align:start position:0%
that time either and they were
 
06:51:26.948 --> 06:51:26.958 align:start position:0%
surrounded by protesters with dism
 
06:51:31.548 --> 06:51:31.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:33.548 --> 06:51:33.558 align:start position:0%
fetuses they were there because of a
 
06:51:35.388 --> 06:51:35.398 align:start position:0%
wanted pregnancy to get gestational
 
06:51:37.868 --> 06:51:37.878 align:start position:0%
dating and their car was surrounded with
 
06:51:40.868 --> 06:51:40.878 align:start position:0%
pictures of dismembered fetuses well of
 
06:51:43.110 --> 06:51:43.120 align:start position:0%
course the couple then called us we had
 
06:51:45.670 --> 06:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
to go get bring some escorts in to bring
 
06:51:47.830 --> 06:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
them into the facility so that they
 
06:51:50.910 --> 06:51:50.920 align:start position:0%
could have gational dating done this was
 
06:51:53.948 --> 06:51:53.958 align:start position:0%
not for anything other than a regular
 
06:51:57.468 --> 06:51:57.478 align:start position:0%
normal legal procedure a second case was
 
06:51:59.350 --> 06:51:59.360 align:start position:0%
a woman had fetal
 
06:52:01.788 --> 06:52:01.798 align:start position:0%
anomalies she's walking into the clinic
 
06:52:04.750 --> 06:52:04.760 align:start position:0%
with her partner this was a wanted
 
06:52:08.590 --> 06:52:08.600 align:start position:0%
pregnancy and the protesters screamed at
 
06:52:13.070 --> 06:52:13.080 align:start position:0%
them saying be a man don't let her be a
 
06:52:15.708 --> 06:52:15.718 align:start position:0%
murderer why don't you take control of
 
06:52:19.628 --> 06:52:19.638 align:start position:0%
your household how can you let her do
 
06:52:22.310 --> 06:52:22.320 align:start position:0%
that the woman when she walked into our
 
06:52:22.320 --> 06:52:23.350 align:start position:0%
that the woman when she walked into our
facility

06:52:23.350 --> 06:52:23.360 align:start position:0%
facility
 
06:52:25.350 --> 06:52:25.360 align:start position:0%
crumpled on the
 
06:52:29.270 --> 06:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
ground sobbing hysterically because she
 
06:52:30.948 --> 06:52:30.958 align:start position:0%
was already convinced that the fetal
 
06:52:33.830 --> 06:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
anomaly was her fault even though it
 
06:52:36.868 --> 06:52:36.878 align:start position:0%
wasn't and then to have these protesters
 
06:52:39.270 --> 06:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
call her a murderer and tell her partner
 
06:52:41.230 --> 06:52:41.240 align:start position:0%
to be a
 
06:52:44.388 --> 06:52:44.398 align:start position:0%
man um and the last one I want to talk
 
06:52:47.788 --> 06:52:47.798 align:start position:0%
to you about is how we had a high school
 
06:52:49.830 --> 06:52:49.840 align:start position:0%
somebody who just graduated high school
 
06:52:51.350 --> 06:52:51.360 align:start position:0%
who thought she was being very
 
06:52:53.830 --> 06:52:53.840 align:start position:0%
responsible who did not want to have a
 
06:52:55.948 --> 06:52:55.958 align:start position:0%
pregnancy because she knew she could not
 
06:52:58.310 --> 06:52:58.320 align:start position:0%
financially afford it did not have the
 
06:53:00.868 --> 06:53:00.878 align:start position:0%
uh familial support and all that did not
 
06:53:03.750 --> 06:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
want to be a burden on the system as she
 
06:53:07.070 --> 06:53:07.080 align:start position:0%
was entering in here she was called a
 
06:53:09.190 --> 06:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
loser because she was trying to make
 
06:53:10.788 --> 06:53:10.798 align:start position:0%
what she thought was a good decision
 
06:53:13.788 --> 06:53:13.798 align:start position:0%
about her life and called a murderer and
 
06:53:13.798 --> 06:53:15.510 align:start position:0%
about her life and called a murderer and
a

06:53:15.510 --> 06:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:53:17.868 --> 06:53:17.878 align:start position:0%
loser um
 
06:53:20.388 --> 06:53:20.398 align:start position:0%
okay I don't want to rush you but if you
 
06:53:22.230 --> 06:53:22.240 align:start position:0%
could sum up your testimony that would
 
06:53:24.110 --> 06:53:24.120 align:start position:0%
be great
 
06:53:26.430 --> 06:53:26.440 align:start position:0%
certainly I'm sorry people do have the
 
06:53:28.310 --> 06:53:28.320 align:start position:0%
right to freedom to Speech but the
 
06:53:30.070 --> 06:53:30.080 align:start position:0%
problem is is we don't know who's going
 
06:53:32.708 --> 06:53:32.718 align:start position:0%
to be well behaved and who's not and
 
06:53:35.388 --> 06:53:35.398 align:start position:0%
therefore we need to keep the bill the
 
06:53:39.670 --> 06:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
buffer zone bill as is and have hp430 in
 
06:53:41.430 --> 06:53:41.440 align:start position:0%
expediate to legislate to be able to
 
06:53:43.430 --> 06:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
protect those people that don't deserve
 
06:53:45.510 --> 06:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
to be screamed at that deserve to get
 
06:53:49.030 --> 06:53:49.040 align:start position:0%

06:53:56.628 --> 06:53:56.638 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:54:00.510 --> 06:54:00.520 align:start position:0%
so by not repealing this you're saying
 
06:54:02.388 --> 06:54:02.398 align:start position:0%
that this is going to help keep people
 
06:54:02.398 --> 06:54:03.910 align:start position:0%
that this is going to help keep people
safe

06:54:03.910 --> 06:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
safe
 
06:54:06.948 --> 06:54:06.958 align:start position:0%
yet earlier it's been testified to that
 
06:54:09.548 --> 06:54:09.558 align:start position:0%
the buffer zone isn't even in in effect
 
06:54:12.230 --> 06:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
that you your facility isn't using the
 
06:54:14.190 --> 06:54:14.200 align:start position:0%
buffer zone so I don't understand why
 
06:54:16.468 --> 06:54:16.478 align:start position:0%
repealing this is going to put more
 
06:54:20.190 --> 06:54:20.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:23.030 --> 06:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
danger I'm not trying to be difficult I
 
06:54:25.948 --> 06:54:25.958 align:start position:0%
do I do no no and actually I truly
 
06:54:27.310 --> 06:54:27.320 align:start position:0%
appreciate the question because I
 
06:54:28.990 --> 06:54:29.000 align:start position:0%
couldn't get to it in my testimony so
 
06:54:32.590 --> 06:54:32.600 align:start position:0%
thank you um the issue is is that
 
06:54:34.270 --> 06:54:34.280 align:start position:0%
sometimes we have protesters that are
 
06:54:36.670 --> 06:54:36.680 align:start position:0%
extremely well- behaved sometimes we
 
06:54:39.868 --> 06:54:39.878 align:start position:0%
don't approximately two years ago we
 
06:54:42.788 --> 06:54:42.798 align:start position:0%
started to get this group that is
 
06:54:46.868 --> 06:54:46.878 align:start position:0%
horrific and not well behaved and really
 
06:54:49.990 --> 06:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
harassing what we started to do is we
 
06:54:52.628 --> 06:54:52.638 align:start position:0%
then in began a new escort program
 
06:54:54.548 --> 06:54:54.558 align:start position:0%
progam and I have been had been
 
06:54:56.270 --> 06:54:56.280 align:start position:0%
documenting the times we were calling
 
06:54:58.030 --> 06:54:58.040 align:start position:0%
the police what was happening and all
 
06:55:01.750 --> 06:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
that I was already in conversations with
 
06:55:04.628 --> 06:55:04.638 align:start position:0%
code enforcement the city solicitor City
 
06:55:06.868 --> 06:55:06.878 align:start position:0%
selectman and the police department here
 
06:55:09.708 --> 06:55:09.718 align:start position:0%
in conquered to talk about instituting a
 
06:55:12.510 --> 06:55:12.520 align:start position:0%
buffer zone and then covid
 
06:55:15.990 --> 06:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
hit with covid everything just kind of
 
06:55:19.230 --> 06:55:19.240 align:start position:0%
has stopped uh we've lost staff I
 
06:55:22.070 --> 06:55:22.080 align:start position:0%
haven't been able to hire in place and
 
06:55:24.590 --> 06:55:24.600 align:start position:0%
we just don't have the person power at
 
06:55:27.110 --> 06:55:27.120 align:start position:0%
this point what I was doing a year ago
 
06:55:30.190 --> 06:55:30.200 align:start position:0%
to continue I would like to continue to
 
06:55:32.670 --> 06:55:32.680 align:start position:0%
go forward but I needed to put a halt on
 
06:55:32.680 --> 06:55:35.350 align:start position:0%
go forward but I needed to put a halt on
things

today I've been on this call the whole
 
06:58:42.830 --> 06:58:42.840 align:start position:0%
time um I'm somebody on the sidewalks in
 
06:58:45.708 --> 06:58:45.718 align:start position:0%
conquer and Manchester uh one
 
06:58:48.670 --> 06:58:48.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity I'd like to share is in
 
06:58:51.868 --> 06:58:51.878 align:start position:0%
Manchester I was on the sidewalk one day
 
06:58:54.190 --> 06:58:54.200 align:start position:0%
and we go in the parking lot and there
 
06:58:57.830 --> 06:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
was a couple there who didn't really
 
06:59:00.388 --> 06:59:00.398 align:start position:0%
have the information they needed and did
 
06:59:02.628 --> 06:59:02.638 align:start position:0%
not understand that abortion is killing
 
06:59:05.590 --> 06:59:05.600 align:start position:0%
a child so we talked over the fence this
 
06:59:09.270 --> 06:59:09.280 align:start position:0%
man was very open to hear um testimony
 
06:59:11.830 --> 06:59:11.840 align:start position:0%
resources and he started to change his
 
06:59:15.110 --> 06:59:15.120 align:start position:0%
mind um Planned Parenthood took the girl
 
06:59:17.708 --> 06:59:17.718 align:start position:0%
in for an appointment and he was calling
 
06:59:19.830 --> 06:59:19.840 align:start position:0%
her at the same time asking what was
 
06:59:22.510 --> 06:59:22.520 align:start position:0%
going on as we talked I've eached out to
 
06:59:25.110 --> 06:59:25.120 align:start position:0%
the resources I had uh the Pregnancy
 
06:59:28.150 --> 06:59:28.160 align:start position:0%
Center in Manchester uh you know a home
 
06:59:29.868 --> 06:59:29.878 align:start position:0%
for mothers to be able to take care of
 
06:59:32.868 --> 06:59:32.878 align:start position:0%
their children everything for free he
 
06:59:36.388 --> 06:59:36.398 align:start position:0%
changed his mind plan Parenthood also
 
06:59:39.030 --> 06:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
decided to take her abortion in that day
 
06:59:41.190 --> 06:59:41.200 align:start position:0%
because she was from a foreign country
 
06:59:43.990 --> 06:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
if we had the time and resources to help
 
06:59:46.430 --> 06:59:46.440 align:start position:0%
people really understand what abortion
 
06:59:49.670 --> 06:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
is we could help them part two and this
 
06:59:51.830 --> 06:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
will be quick is the reason why I
 
06:59:54.548 --> 06:59:54.558 align:start position:0%
believe in freedom of speech is because
 
06:59:57.548 --> 06:59:57.558 align:start position:0%
it's a right and as I'm in conquered and
 
06:59:59.868 --> 06:59:59.878 align:start position:0%
we could go back and forth to even a
 
07:00:01.868 --> 07:00:01.878 align:start position:0%
chemical spray in someone's eyes from
 
07:00:04.670 --> 07:00:04.680 align:start position:0%
the escort we have the freedom to lie
 
07:00:06.788 --> 07:00:06.798 align:start position:0%
and that's something whether we agree or
 
07:00:10.468 --> 07:00:10.478 align:start position:0%
not we should have so thank
 
07:00:13.510 --> 07:00:13.520 align:start position:0%

been into Planned Parenthood for birth
 
07:01:07.468 --> 07:01:07.478 align:start position:0%
control not for an abortion um I was not
 
07:01:10.110 --> 07:01:10.120 align:start position:0%
stopped by individuals but I did feel
 
07:01:12.510 --> 07:01:12.520 align:start position:0%
intimidated and had I not had support I
 
07:01:14.548 --> 07:01:14.558 align:start position:0%
may have not gone into the facility not
 
07:01:17.030 --> 07:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
gotten um needed birth control and then
 
07:01:20.510 --> 07:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
ended up actually needing an abortion um
 
07:01:22.670 --> 07:01:22.680 align:start position:0%
and these individuals while there are
 
07:01:24.468 --> 07:01:24.478 align:start position:0%
individuals who just try to give
 
07:01:27.670 --> 07:01:27.680 align:start position:0%

community if individuals wanted this
 
07:01:36.190 --> 07:01:36.200 align:start position:0%
information they would seek it out
 
07:01:38.990 --> 07:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
themselves and this is also given um by
 
07:01:41.310 --> 07:01:41.320 align:start position:0%
medical providers um and so I just
 
07:01:43.468 --> 07:01:43.478 align:start position:0%
wanted to to kind of put that out there
 
07:01:47.270 --> 07:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
that even if uh with this 25 foot um
 
07:01:50.230 --> 07:01:50.240 align:start position:0%
radius uh individuals could be 25 ft
 
07:01:52.750 --> 07:01:52.760 align:start position:0%
away and then seek out um that Council
 
07:01:54.788 --> 07:01:54.798 align:start position:0%
if they wished to have it but didn't
 
07:01:58.110 --> 07:01:58.120 align:start position:0%
need to walk past faces um that were
 
07:01:59.990 --> 07:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
shameful while they were trying to
 
07:02:02.990 --> 07:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
receive needed care um thank you thank

07:02:23.628 --> 07:02:23.638 align:start position:0%
that the hearing on house Bill 4:30 is
 
07:02:23.638 --> 07:02:26.070 align:start position:0%

07:02:29.510 --> 07:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
closed and uh thank everybody for their
 
07:02:32.150 --> 07:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
patience today in particular with regard
 
07:02:34.270 --> 07:02:34.280 align:start position:0%
to the technical difficulties we had at
 
07:02:37.388 --> 07:02:37.398 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the afternoon we are on
 
07:02:40.708 --> 07:02:40.718 align:start position:0%
for tomorrow morning at 9
 
07:02:43.230 --> 07:02:43.240 align:start position:0%
o'clock I have received a note
 
07:02:45.388 --> 07:02:45.398 align:start position:0%
indicating that they have to do some
 
07:02:47.310 --> 07:02:47.320 align:start position:0%
work on the internet here in the
 
07:02:49.510 --> 07:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
building and have asked us to complete
 
07:02:51.548 --> 07:02:51.558 align:start position:0%
our hearings by 4 o'clock tomorrow and I
 
07:02:53.868 --> 07:02:53.878 align:start position:0%
certainly hope we'll be able to do that
 
07:02:57.270 --> 07:02:57.280 align:start position:0%
so and in the event is there any other
 
07:03:00.070 --> 07:03:00.080 align:start position:0%
business that we yes uh representative
 
07:03:03.270 --> 07:03:03.280 align:start position:0%
MC Beth thank you chairman Gordon I'm
 
07:03:05.548 --> 07:03:05.558 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could read the tally of
 
07:03:07.750 --> 07:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
pro and con people that signed the blue
 
07:03:11.788 --> 07:03:11.798 align:start position:0%
sheet or register it online thank you I
 
07:03:14.110 --> 07:03:14.120 align:start position:0%
can uh but I don't have it with me
 
07:03:16.430 --> 07:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
because I went in the other room so we
 
07:03:18.788 --> 07:03:18.798 align:start position:0%
could avoid the technical difficulties
 
07:03:20.788 --> 07:03:20.798 align:start position:0%
but if you wait just a second I'll be
 
07:03:22.548 --> 07:03:22.558 align:start position:0%
right back
 
07:03:50.788 --> 07:03:50.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:50.798 --> 07:04:02.070 align:start position:0%
 
chairman

07:04:02.070 --> 07:04:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:05.510 --> 07:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 622 the original uh the
 
07:04:07.788 --> 07:04:07.798 align:start position:0%
first one of the first two bills we
 
07:04:09.590 --> 07:04:09.600 align:start position:0%
heard first thing this
 
07:04:14.150 --> 07:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
morning 77 people uh registered in
 
07:04:17.590 --> 07:04:17.600 align:start position:0%
support of that bill and
 
07:04:20.788 --> 07:04:20.798 align:start position:0%
729 registered in opposition to that
 
07:04:20.798 --> 07:04:23.350 align:start position:0%
729 registered in opposition to that
bill

07:04:23.350 --> 07:04:23.360 align:start position:0%
bill
 
07:04:25.708 --> 07:04:25.718 align:start position:0%
representative Gordon do we have any way
 
07:04:27.868 --> 07:04:27.878 align:start position:0%
of telling who's from New Hampshire and
 
07:04:30.788 --> 07:04:30.798 align:start position:0%
who's not on those
 
07:04:36.190 --> 07:04:36.200 align:start position:0%
signups uh yes oh well no not really uh
 
07:04:38.628 --> 07:04:38.638 align:start position:0%
I don't really the only thing that I can
 
07:04:41.910 --> 07:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
tell is by telephone number so I can
 
07:04:45.830 --> 07:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
look at the area codes on there and
 
07:04:50.230 --> 07:04:50.240 align:start position:0%
clearly the the vast majority are 603
 
07:04:52.510 --> 07:04:52.520 align:start position:0%
area codes there are some other area
 
07:04:55.150 --> 07:04:55.160 align:start position:0%
codes but you can't really tell from the
 
07:04:58.388 --> 07:04:58.398 align:start position:0%
area codes because people get different
 
07:05:00.788 --> 07:05:00.798 align:start position:0%
area codes when they get different
 
07:05:04.948 --> 07:05:04.958 align:start position:0%
phones so uh in particular cell phon
 
07:05:07.868 --> 07:05:07.878 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to tell you that for sure
 
07:05:11.350 --> 07:05:11.360 align:start position:0%
but I don't know Mr chairman Mr chair
 
07:05:14.350 --> 07:05:14.360 align:start position:0%
yeah M Mr chairman I I asked Jason
 
07:05:17.708 --> 07:05:17.718 align:start position:0%
Osborne to have the IT people change
 
07:05:20.590 --> 07:05:20.600 align:start position:0%
that online registration form to
 
07:05:22.310 --> 07:05:22.320 align:start position:0%
indicate a place for them to show their
 
07:05:24.110 --> 07:05:24.120 align:start position:0%
town of residence he said they're
 
07:05:27.270 --> 07:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
working on it that that would be great
 
07:05:29.030 --> 07:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh I I have to tell you when I picked
 
07:05:32.190 --> 07:05:32.200 align:start position:0%
the witnesses today I picked the 603
 
07:05:33.868 --> 07:05:33.878 align:start position:0%
area codes as we went through the
 
07:05:36.708 --> 07:05:36.718 align:start position:0%
witness list uh first and gave them
 
07:05:39.270 --> 07:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
priority in most
 
07:05:43.990 --> 07:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
cases Mr chair yes well first of all our
 
07:05:46.830 --> 07:05:46.840 align:start position:0%
right to no laws um apply equally to
 
07:05:48.230 --> 07:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
people inside and outside of New
 
07:05:50.590 --> 07:05:50.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so we certainly couldn't ban
 
07:05:53.750 --> 07:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
anyone from ifying or signing never
 
07:05:56.310 --> 07:05:56.320 align:start position:0%
suggested anyone should be banned please
 
07:05:58.628 --> 07:05:58.638 align:start position:0%
don't put words in my mouth I'll also my
 
07:06:01.070 --> 07:06:01.080 align:start position:0%
second Point well I'm just expressing my
 
07:06:02.190 --> 07:06:02.200 align:start position:0%
opinion I wasn't putting words in
 
07:06:03.830 --> 07:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
anybody's mouth but my own and the other
 
07:06:06.948 --> 07:06:06.958 align:start position:0%
thing is the only i a not of I kept
 
07:06:09.830 --> 07:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
track of everybody who spoke uh during
 
07:06:11.628 --> 07:06:11.638 align:start position:0%
the hearing of most of their names in
 
07:06:14.070 --> 07:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
625 and the only person I
 
07:06:16.670 --> 07:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
remember acknowledging out the state was
 
07:06:19.388 --> 07:06:19.398 align:start position:0%
uh where Colleen the woman who's the
 
07:06:20.990 --> 07:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
president of Americans United for life
 
07:06:23.628 --> 07:06:23.638 align:start position:0%
which is DC based uh source so even um
 
07:06:27.430 --> 07:06:27.440 align:start position:0%
you know so probably that was primarily
 
07:06:29.510 --> 07:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
I doubt that she was and she was um you
 
07:06:30.948 --> 07:06:30.958 align:start position:0%
know against the bill so I certainly
 
07:06:33.230 --> 07:06:33.240 align:start position:0%
don't think those 729 people have a
 
07:06:35.310 --> 07:06:35.320 align:start position:0%
disproportionate number of out of state
 
07:06:37.910 --> 07:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
residents in there so probably
 
07:06:40.750 --> 07:06:40.760 align:start position:0%
uh this probably the vast majority of
 
07:06:43.030 --> 07:06:43.040 align:start position:0%
these were people from in state and U
 
07:06:44.270 --> 07:06:44.280 align:start position:0%
and as I said The only person who
 
07:06:46.070 --> 07:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
actually I recall saying she was from
 
07:06:48.190 --> 07:06:48.200 align:start position:0%
out of state and certainly her was the
 
07:06:50.070 --> 07:06:50.080 align:start position:0%
uh head of Americans United for life
 
07:06:52.868 --> 07:06:52.878 align:start position:0%
which the DC based group certainly
 
07:06:55.030 --> 07:06:55.040 align:start position:0%
entitled to be interested in the issues
 
07:06:56.388 --> 07:06:56.398 align:start position:0%
these bills
 
07:07:00.070 --> 07:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
so clear clear clearly the vast majority
 
07:07:03.070 --> 07:07:03.080 align:start position:0%
of people who signed up had 603 area
 
07:07:06.590 --> 07:07:06.600 align:start position:0%
code so yeah the with regard to House
 
07:07:06.600 --> 07:07:08.590 align:start position:0%
code so yeah the with regard to House
Bill

07:07:08.590 --> 07:07:08.600 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
07:07:11.468 --> 07:07:11.478 align:start position:0%
625 there there were
 
07:07:16.510 --> 07:07:16.520 align:start position:0%
576 people who registered in support and
 
07:07:20.510 --> 07:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
735 who registered in
 
07:07:20.520 --> 07:07:24.230 align:start position:0%
735 who registered in
opposition

07:07:24.230 --> 07:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:27.388 --> 07:07:27.398 align:start position:0%
and with regard to House Bill
 
07:07:29.468 --> 07:07:29.478 align:start position:0%
430 there were
 
07:07:33.548 --> 07:07:33.558 align:start position:0%
259 who registered in support and
 
07:07:37.750 --> 07:07:37.760 align:start position:0%

07:07:53.910 --> 07:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
today and I because I I saw people were
 
07:07:59.628 --> 07:07:59.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:01.910 --> 07:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
afternoon uh is there any other business
 
07:08:04.788 --> 07:08:04.798 align:start position:0%
that we need to address this
 
07:08:08.750 --> 07:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
afternoon as I said earlier I uh and I
 
07:08:11.388 --> 07:08:11.398 align:start position:0%
don't know if it was a problem with the
 
07:08:13.110 --> 07:08:13.120 align:start position:0%
technical difficulties but I tried to
 
07:08:15.628 --> 07:08:15.638 align:start position:0%
get a schedule for the 17th they're
 
07:08:17.548 --> 07:08:17.558 align:start position:0%
unable because there just aren't any
 
07:08:20.388 --> 07:08:20.398 align:start position:0%
hearing rooms to hold it on the 17th and
 
07:08:23.548 --> 07:08:23.558 align:start position:0%
so we're and the following week we have
 
07:08:25.468 --> 07:08:25.478 align:start position:0%
two weeks of session so we'll only have

two days a week if there aren't hearing
 
07:08:40.030 --> 07:08:40.040 align:start position:0%

07:10:03.750 --> 07:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:07.830 --> 07:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
afternoon we uh and and thank you the
 
07:10:09.110 --> 07:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
for the three people who did the
 
07:10:10.670 --> 07:10:10.680 align:start position:0%
committee reports on the bills that
 
07:10:14.510 --> 07:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:14.520 --> 07:10:17.750 align:start position:0%
 
exacted

07:10:17.750 --> 07:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:22.628 --> 07:10:22.638 align:start position:0%
and Mr chairman yes
 
07:10:25.548 --> 07:10:25.558 align:start position:0%
um Mr chairman I just want I I made a
 
07:10:27.750 --> 07:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
comment earlier and I'd like to repeat
 
07:10:32.548 --> 07:10:32.558 align:start position:0%
it last week when we had to because of
 
07:10:36.910 --> 07:10:36.920 align:start position:0%
snow have everything remote the entire
 
07:10:41.388 --> 07:10:41.398 align:start position:0%
day went through without a problem today
 
07:10:45.830 --> 07:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
the only problems seem to come from the
 
07:10:49.388 --> 07:10:49.398 align:start position:0%
difficulties um taking place in the
 
07:10:53.868 --> 07:10:53.878 align:start position:0%
committee room um um so I wonder if you
 
07:10:55.910 --> 07:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
would consider the
 
07:10:59.190 --> 07:10:59.200 align:start position:0%
possibility of denying yourself the
 
07:11:03.830 --> 07:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
pleasure of being in the LLB and just
 
07:11:07.670 --> 07:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
conducting these uh hearings uh all
 
07:11:11.030 --> 07:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
remotely and then perhaps we could meet
 
07:11:14.948 --> 07:11:14.958 align:start position:0%
next on on the 16th and on the 17th
 
07:11:16.750 --> 07:11:16.760 align:start position:0%
which would help a lot we have more
 
07:11:20.590 --> 07:11:20.600 align:start position:0%
bills than anybody else and um we're
 
07:11:23.868 --> 07:11:23.878 align:start position:0%
going to have a hard time giving them
 
07:11:26.510 --> 07:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
the kind of attention that they deserve
 
07:11:30.590 --> 07:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
if we don't have more meeting times so
 
07:11:33.830 --> 07:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
it's just a suggestion and um I don't
 
07:11:36.070 --> 07:11:36.080 align:start position:0%
know if there are other factors at play
 
07:11:40.708 --> 07:11:40.718 align:start position:0%
but we did do it without you did it
 
07:11:43.868 --> 07:11:43.878 align:start position:0%
without a hiccup last week when it was
 
07:11:45.948 --> 07:11:45.958 align:start position:0%
all done in
 
07:11:45.958 --> 07:11:47.548 align:start position:0%
all done in
absentia

07:11:47.548 --> 07:11:47.558 align:start position:0%
absentia
 
07:11:51.310 --> 07:11:51.320 align:start position:0%
y uh well that's a possibility I I one
 
07:11:55.190 --> 07:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
of the limitations isn't just the uh
 
07:11:57.830 --> 07:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
committee rooms it's the number of Zoom
 
07:12:00.628 --> 07:12:00.638 align:start position:0%
licenses that they have as well so I can
 
07:12:03.388 --> 07:12:03.398 align:start position:0%
check I can check to see whether that is
 
07:12:06.388 --> 07:12:06.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:08.510 --> 07:12:08.520 align:start position:0%
possible and I and I will check
 
07:12:08.520 --> 07:12:09.670 align:start position:0%
possible and I and I will check
