1665.
 
00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
this bill came about after the july 29th
 
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
storm that hit our state and created
 
00:08:09.749 --> 00:08:09.759 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars in damage to towns
 
00:08:11.909 --> 00:08:11.919 align:start position:0%
in cheshire and sullivan county
 
00:08:14.309 --> 00:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
specifically i'm here to talk about what
 
00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
happened in my own little town of
 
00:08:17.909 --> 00:08:17.919 align:start position:0%
acworth and how this bill
 
00:08:20.469 --> 00:08:20.479 align:start position:0%
would have helped us tremendously
 
00:08:22.469 --> 00:08:22.479 align:start position:0%
because of the july floods my town
 
00:08:24.309 --> 00:08:24.319 align:start position:0%
suffered millions of dollars of road
 
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
damage bridge damage and crop damage
 
00:08:28.869 --> 00:08:28.879 align:start position:0%
farmer fields were destroyed at the
 
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
start of harvest season
 
00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
sap lines were damaged and hay was left
 
00:08:34.949 --> 00:08:34.959 align:start position:0%
to rot in the fields
 
00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:36.959 align:start position:0%
because our roads were badly damaged
 
00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
farmers were unable to empty their
 
00:08:40.469 --> 00:08:40.479 align:start position:0%
manure pits and mail could not be
 
00:08:43.029 --> 00:08:43.039 align:start position:0%
delivered utility poles in danger of
 
00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
falling over could not be reached to
 
00:08:46.949 --> 00:08:46.959 align:start position:0%
repair them and we could not get
 
00:08:48.949 --> 00:08:48.959 align:start position:0%
emergency vehicles through these roads
 
00:08:48.959 --> 00:08:49.910 align:start position:0%
emergency vehicles through these roads
either

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
either
 
00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
there was only one way in and out of our
 
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:52.870 align:start position:0%
there was only one way in and out of our
town

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
town
 
00:08:56.389 --> 00:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
and that road had been damaged as well
 
00:08:58.710 --> 00:08:58.720 align:start position:0%
akworth had a total of nine roads that
 
00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:00.800 align:start position:0%
were made totally impassable by this
 
00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:01.750 align:start position:0%
were made totally impassable by this
storm

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
storm
 
00:09:03.509 --> 00:09:03.519 align:start position:0%
and left in a condition which made them
 
00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
look like an earthquake had struck i've
 
00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
passed around some photos so you can see
 
00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:09.200 align:start position:0%
a sampling
 
00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:15.269 --> 00:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
seven of those were paved roads an
 
00:09:17.509 --> 00:09:17.519 align:start position:0%
expensive investment for our little town
 
00:09:19.509 --> 00:09:19.519 align:start position:0%
of 850 people
 
00:09:21.269 --> 00:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
three and a half miles of crane brook
 
00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
road a major north-south paved road of
 
00:09:25.829 --> 00:09:25.839 align:start position:0%
which the paving was completed only a
 
00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
few years earlier was severely damaged
 
00:09:30.949 --> 00:09:30.959 align:start position:0%
and the crane broke a light alongside
 
00:09:32.949 --> 00:09:32.959 align:start position:0%
the road became a huge water management
 
00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:34.959 align:start position:0%
and wetlands issue
 
00:09:37.269 --> 00:09:37.279 align:start position:0%
culvert failures caused massive damage
 
00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
to the area and we feared more flooding
 
00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
would happen with future rainstorms
 
00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
clark's sugar house was surrounded by
 
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
debris washed down from the road and in
 
00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:48.640 align:start position:0%
short it was a natural disaster that
 
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
caused extensive and expensive damage
 
00:09:53.509 --> 00:09:53.519 align:start position:0%
which a small town like acworth would
 
00:09:55.509 --> 00:09:55.519 align:start position:0%
not be able to absorb
 
00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
decades of investment in our roads and
 
00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
bridges were demolished in one night
 
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
causing issues concerning safety
 
00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
commerce the environment and quality of
 
00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.550 align:start position:0%
commerce the environment and quality of
life

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
life
 
00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
it was clear to people who had come to
 
00:10:10.389 --> 00:10:10.399 align:start position:0%
actually see the damage that we had
 
00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars and years of repair
 
00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
work facing our town
 
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
initially the estimates were around 10
 
00:10:19.269 --> 00:10:19.279 align:start position:0%
to 15 million dollars they have since
 
00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
gone higher because of inflation and
 
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
difficulty obtaining materials
 
00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:26.240 align:start position:0%
the town had to get temporary work
 
00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:28.160 align:start position:0%
started immediately to make roads
 
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
passable and safe
 
00:10:32.069 --> 00:10:32.079 align:start position:0%
des and homeland security emergency
 
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
management did not come
 
00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
until september 8 2021 to assess damage
 
00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
a full month and a half after the floods
 
00:10:41.509 --> 00:10:41.519 align:start position:0%
hit us
 
00:10:43.829 --> 00:10:43.839 align:start position:0%
meanwhile state roads that were damaged
 
00:10:46.389 --> 00:10:46.399 align:start position:0%
around vilas pool and alstead and other
 
00:10:49.269 --> 00:10:49.279 align:start position:0%
spots on route 123a were being addressed
 
00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
by state crews nhdot was kind enough to
 
00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
loan us road barriers and signage to
 
00:10:57.829 --> 00:10:57.839 align:start position:0%
alert citizens to closed roads
 
00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
i sent out emails with photos and videos
 
00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
of the damage and pleaded with our state
 
00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
leadership including the fiscal
 
00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
committee and executive council for
 
00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
financial help
 
00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
and while i received much sympathy and
 
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
concern from my colleagues and from the
 
00:11:14.389 --> 00:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
house and senate finance leaders i was
 
00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
surprised and shocked to find out that
 
00:11:19.269 --> 00:11:19.279 align:start position:0%
there was absolutely no statutory
 
00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:21.680 align:start position:0%
vehicle in our state statutes to have
 
00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
immediate financial help available to
 
00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:26.240 align:start position:0%
any municipality that suffered this kind
 
00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:29.200 align:start position:0%
of damage from a natural disaster
 
00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.030 align:start position:0%
of damage from a natural disaster
none

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
none
 
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
currently our state is flush with arpa
 
00:11:35.269 --> 00:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
funding and a healthy surplus yet
 
00:11:37.829 --> 00:11:37.839 align:start position:0%
acworth has not had any financial help
 
00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
from the state because there's no
 
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
statutory vehicle to get it to us we
 
00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
have since had a town meeting to
 
00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:46.720 align:start position:0%
authorize a two point one million dollar
 
00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:47.750 align:start position:0%
authorize a two point one million dollar
loan

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
loan
 
00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
from a skelmet bank
 
00:11:51.829 --> 00:11:51.839 align:start position:0%
who was willing willing to work with us
 
00:11:53.509 --> 00:11:53.519 align:start position:0%
but we still have to figure out how to
 
00:11:54.949 --> 00:11:54.959 align:start position:0%
pay it back
 
00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
our town has enormous financial
 
00:11:58.629 --> 00:11:58.639 align:start position:0%
challenges facing us
 
00:12:00.389 --> 00:12:00.399 align:start position:0%
the only statute that touched on the
 
00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:04.240 align:start position:0%
possibility of state help was rsa 21 p
 
00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
colon 37. the statute allowed money to
 
00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
be loaned to a municipality from the
 
00:12:11.829 --> 00:12:11.839 align:start position:0%
state treasury but only after a
 
00:12:13.829 --> 00:12:13.839 align:start position:0%
presidential declaration of emergency
 
00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
was granted by the president of the
 
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
united states
 
00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
that declaration would also allow our
 
00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:21.200 align:start position:0%
state municipalities to file for fema
 
00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
funding later on
 
00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:25.200 align:start position:0%
in the beginning for us that was months
 
00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.230 align:start position:0%
in the beginning for us that was months
away

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:26.240 align:start position:0%
away
 
00:12:28.629 --> 00:12:28.639 align:start position:0%
it was of zero immediate help to our
 
00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
town we needed immediate financial help
 
00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
to pay for material and workers to make
 
00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
our roads temporarily sound until
 
00:12:37.509 --> 00:12:37.519 align:start position:0%
permanent fixes can be done with the
 
00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
help of the fema disaster programs
 
00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
there was actually one other statute
 
00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
that could have been used and that was
 
00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
rsa 9 colon 13d regarding civil
 
00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
emergencies and that would require the
 
00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
governor to act to provide funds in a
 
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
civil emergency
 
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
he chose not to do that despite letters
 
00:12:58.230 --> 00:12:58.240 align:start position:0%
and requests from my constituents
 
00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
our letters never even got the courtesy
 
00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
of a reply
 
00:13:03.509 --> 00:13:03.519 align:start position:0%
the governor did send a letter to the
 
00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:05.200 align:start position:0%
president requesting an emergency
 
00:13:09.509 --> 00:13:09.519 align:start position:0%
declaration on this on september 27 2021
 
00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
a full two months after the storm hit us
 
00:13:14.389 --> 00:13:14.399 align:start position:0%
the disaster emergency declaration was
 
00:13:17.269 --> 00:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
granted one month later on october 28
 
00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
2021 so it took three months for an
 
00:13:22.949 --> 00:13:22.959 align:start position:0%
emergency declaration to be declared
 
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
in that time period acworth had to
 
00:13:27.509 --> 00:13:27.519 align:start position:0%
scramble to temporarily fix roads to
 
00:13:29.509 --> 00:13:29.519 align:start position:0%
make them safe and passable and figure
 
00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
out how to pay for it with its limited
 
00:13:34.069 --> 00:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
funds especially as winter was on the
 
00:13:36.389 --> 00:13:36.399 align:start position:0%
horizon and we all knew the ground would
 
00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
start freezing by the end of october
 
00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
it's january now
 
00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
all of our roads are open and passable
 
00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
we're just completing a damage inventory
 
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
for fema it is unlikely that we will see
 
00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
any fema money until late spring at best
 
00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
acworth declared its own state of local
 
00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
emergency on monday august 9 2021 and
 
00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
the acworth select board voted to alert
 
00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
department of revenue that we would be
 
00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
overspending our budget and let them
 
00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
know we'd be taking three hundred fifty
 
00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars out of our fund balance
 
00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:10.720 align:start position:0%
which at the time had five hundred and
 
00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollars as a balance that
 
00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
left us with a recommended minimum fund
 
00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
balance of two hundred thousand dollars
 
00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:20.720 align:start position:0%
acworth had already spent 150 000 of
 
00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:24.240 align:start position:0%
that 350 000 on temporary road repairs
 
00:14:26.069 --> 00:14:26.079 align:start position:0%
for the charlestown road luther hill
 
00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
road intersection and upper dairy hill
 
00:14:30.389 --> 00:14:30.399 align:start position:0%
road culvert repair to make them
 
00:14:30.399 --> 00:14:31.590 align:start position:0%
road culvert repair to make them
passable

00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
passable
 
00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
those roads were of utmost importance so
 
00:14:35.509 --> 00:14:35.519 align:start position:0%
farmers could stop dumping their milk
 
00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
because milk trucks could not get
 
00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:40.160 align:start position:0%
through as well as allowing feed trucks
 
00:14:42.949 --> 00:14:42.959 align:start position:0%
to come in with feed for dairy cows it
 
00:14:44.949 --> 00:14:44.959 align:start position:0%
would also allow customers through to el
 
00:14:47.189 --> 00:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
sessors blueberry farm at the height of
 
00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
the picking season it was also the roads
 
00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
necessary for the multi-million dollar
 
00:14:54.069 --> 00:14:54.079 align:start position:0%
bascom maple farms to get and send
 
00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
delivery trucks through
 
00:14:57.829 --> 00:14:57.839 align:start position:0%
making sure these commercial businesses
 
00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:00.160 align:start position:0%
could get back to work was crucial
 
00:15:01.829 --> 00:15:01.839 align:start position:0%
given we had already burned through a
 
00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
hundred and fifty thousand dollars for
 
00:15:05.189 --> 00:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
one intersection
 
00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
we are worried now or we were worried
 
00:15:09.509 --> 00:15:09.519 align:start position:0%
how far the remaining two hundred
 
00:15:11.269 --> 00:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars would take us to do
 
00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
other needed temporary road repairs
 
00:15:17.269 --> 00:15:17.279 align:start position:0%
the town also had to hire an engineer to
 
00:15:18.949 --> 00:15:18.959 align:start position:0%
assess damage and start working on
 
00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
damage inventory and materials inventory
 
00:15:24.629 --> 00:15:24.639 align:start position:0%
it was not an easy or quick task to do
 
00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
we had to find out how much material
 
00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:28.720 align:start position:0%
we'd need and time and labor involved
 
00:15:31.269 --> 00:15:31.279 align:start position:0%
for just the temporary fixes
 
00:15:33.189 --> 00:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
and then get engineers and contractors
 
00:15:35.749 --> 00:15:35.759 align:start position:0%
to work with us later on the permanent
 
00:15:35.759 --> 00:15:36.790 align:start position:0%
to work with us later on the permanent
fixes

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
fixes
 
00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
we also had a scramble to obtain des
 
00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
emergency permits
 
00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
there were costs associated with
 
00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
obtaining all of this work there were
 
00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
miles of roads to assess and on some
 
00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
roads the damage was quite extensive
 
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
in my opinion
 
00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
our own homeland security emergency
 
00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
management was ill-equipped to deal with
 
00:15:58.230 --> 00:15:58.240 align:start position:0%
the kind of damage in our town and their
 
00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
assessment tools were antiquated it was
 
00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
laughable that they sent out engineers
 
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
with wheel measurers to try to assess
 
00:16:08.389 --> 00:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
every foot of damaged roadway
 
00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
when we had miles of it
 
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
this was clearly a task that would have
 
00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
taken years to accomplish and an idea
 
00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:16.720 align:start position:0%
that was quickly abandoned
 
00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
so given all that and our experiences it
 
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
was my opinion that we had to have a
 
00:16:23.189 --> 00:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
statute such as this one that i'm
 
00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
presenting today one which would provide
 
00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
gap funding to municipalities that have
 
00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
extensive damage
 
00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
and that is little resources and a small
 
00:16:34.069 --> 00:16:34.079 align:start position:0%
tax base to absorb the cost of such
 
00:16:34.079 --> 00:16:35.430 align:start position:0%
tax base to absorb the cost of such
damage

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
damage
 
00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:37.360 align:start position:0%
the gap funding would allow towns to
 
00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
have some financial breathing room
 
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
between the time the disaster strikes to
 
00:16:44.389 --> 00:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
when fema money becomes available
 
00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:46.160 align:start position:0%
it would go a long way to helping a
 
00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
small town with little resources to
 
00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
begin to rebuild and make roads and
 
00:16:52.389 --> 00:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
other infrastructure safe for its
 
00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
citizens and businesses
 
00:16:57.829 --> 00:16:57.839 align:start position:0%
using our fund balance some capital
 
00:16:59.910 --> 00:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
reserve money and some money from our
 
00:17:03.269 --> 00:17:03.279 align:start position:0%
muscoma loan to date acworth has spent
 
00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
about one million two hundred seventeen
 
00:17:07.909 --> 00:17:07.919 align:start position:0%
thousand one hundred nineteen dollars on
 
00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
flood and road repairs
 
00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:11.640 align:start position:0%
and for two
 
00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
2022 we are budgeting one million eight
 
00:17:16.789 --> 00:17:16.799 align:start position:0%
hundred sixty two thousand six hundred
 
00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
forty two for flood repairs alone
 
00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:22.240 align:start position:0%
our municipal budget is usually around
 
00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:26.079 align:start position:0%
1.3 million but in 2021 we overspent
 
00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
because of the flood damage repairs
 
00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:30.559 align:start position:0%
we're looking at a municipal tax mill
 
00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
rate increase of from seven dollars and
 
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
eighty one cents to nine dollars and
 
00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
twenty one cent uh twenty seven cents
 
00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
per ferment per mill for our residents
 
00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
but we're trying to cut out other areas
 
00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
of the 2022 budget to bring that
 
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
increase down
 
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
this bipartisan bill seeks to set up a
 
00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:52.720 align:start position:0%
municipal disaster relief fund a fund
 
00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:54.720 align:start position:0%
that would be funded in part by
 
00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities themselves through an
 
00:17:59.750 --> 00:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
annual payment from their town to fund
 
00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
to the fund which acts like a risk pool
 
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
of sorts
 
00:18:05.909 --> 00:18:05.919 align:start position:0%
money would also be deposited into it by
 
00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
the state on an annual basis through the
 
00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:10.160 align:start position:0%
state budgeting process as well as
 
00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
through any infrastructure grants they
 
00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
can obtain from the federal government
 
00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
it may be too late for acworth to
 
00:18:18.549 --> 00:18:18.559 align:start position:0%
benefit from such a fund but it would
 
00:18:18.559 --> 00:18:19.430 align:start position:0%
benefit from such a fund but it would
have

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
it would have been
 
00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:22.720 align:start position:0%
a godsend
 
00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
had we had access to that kind of relief
 
00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:25.990 align:start position:0%
had we had access to that kind of relief
money

00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
so i hope that you'll pass this bill out
 
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
of your committee with an otp
 
00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
recommendation and i'm happy to answer
 
00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
any questions that you have regarding
 
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:35.200 align:start position:0%
this bill or the damage that we
 
00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
sustained thanks
 
00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
to the committee does the committee have
 
00:18:41.029 --> 00:18:41.039 align:start position:0%
any questions for representative aaron
 
00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:44.240 align:start position:0%
yes representative power
 
00:18:45.909 --> 00:18:45.919 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question my
 
00:18:51.909 --> 00:18:51.919 align:start position:0%
question pertains to page 1 line 15
 
00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
and specifically um i'm looking at the
 
00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:00.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:03.029 --> 00:19:03.039 align:start position:0%
0.005 percent
 
00:19:05.029 --> 00:19:05.039 align:start position:0%
that seems low to me
 
00:19:05.039 --> 00:19:07.350 align:start position:0%
that seems low to me
and

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
almost there's
 
00:19:11.029 --> 00:19:11.039 align:start position:0%
as a result of that figure
 
00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
there's almost no cost to
 
00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:15.190 align:start position:0%
there's almost no cost to
municipalities

00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:15.200 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
to contribute to this risk management
 
00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:18.630 align:start position:0%
to contribute to this risk management
pool

00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:18.640 align:start position:0%
pool
 
00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
that provides the gap funding
 
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
so for example like in brookline the
 
00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:28.070 align:start position:0%
so for example like in brookline the
0.005

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
of our budget of 6 million dollars is a
 
00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:32.870 align:start position:0%
of our budget of 6 million dollars is a
300

00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
300
 
00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
annual contribution to this fund
 
00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
so my question is is that figure correct
 
00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:48.400 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:50.789 align:start position:0%
would be
fine

00:19:50.789 --> 00:19:50.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
follow follow-up follow-up go ahead i i
 
00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
believe that there might be a like a a
 
00:19:57.909 --> 00:19:57.919 align:start position:0%
scribner's error if you will yeah and
 
00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
that it's it should be 0.5 percent or
 
00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:05.190 align:start position:0%
that it's it should be 0.5 percent or
0.005

00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:05.200 align:start position:0%
0.005
 
00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
yeah we were we were looking i told the
 
00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.230 align:start position:0%
yeah we were we were looking i told the
um

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:16.559 align:start position:0%
the drafter that it was it should be a
 
00:20:18.789 --> 00:20:18.799 align:start position:0%
half of one percent
 
00:20:21.029 --> 00:20:21.039 align:start position:0%
so for example for for acworth it would
 
00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:22.480 align:start position:0%
have been something like five thousand
 
00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:23.510 align:start position:0%
have been something like five thousand
dollars

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:31.029 --> 00:20:31.039 align:start position:0%
yes representative powell
 
00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
add one more fault so are you clear that
 
00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
in the language of the bill there's
 
00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
there's an error i agree that
 
00:20:40.789 --> 00:20:40.799 align:start position:0%
half a percent
 
00:20:40.799 --> 00:20:41.510 align:start position:0%
half a percent
is

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
is more reasonable but in here just the
 
00:20:47.029 --> 00:20:47.039 align:start position:0%
way that it's stated in the language
 
00:20:49.669 --> 00:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
i i see an error yeah yeah okay thank
 
00:20:49.679 --> 00:20:51.750 align:start position:0%
i i see an error yeah yeah okay thank
you

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
representative guthrie
 
00:20:56.789 --> 00:20:56.799 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:20:59.029 --> 00:20:59.039 align:start position:0%
uh and thank you for taking uh the
 
00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
could you tell me do you eventually get
 
00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:05.510 align:start position:0%
could you tell me do you eventually get
uh

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:08.240 align:start position:0%
money uh recovery money from fema or any
 
00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:11.200 align:start position:0%
other state like this is a
 
00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:12.630 align:start position:0%
other state like this is a
gap

00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
gap
 
00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh bill it gets you over the hump but do
 
00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
you eventually get the
 
00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
relief from the federal government or
 
00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
state government when you have a
 
00:21:23.029 --> 00:21:23.039 align:start position:0%
disaster such as this
 
00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
so how this is going to work is that as
 
00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
we've got an inventory of projects that
 
00:21:35.029 --> 00:21:35.039 align:start position:0%
we're going to do and as we
 
00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
start a project and work on this project
 
00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
the town has to lay out that funding
 
00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
and at the end of when the project is
 
00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
completed say one stretch of roadway
 
00:21:49.029 --> 00:21:49.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
you submit all the paperwork to fema
 
00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
citing all the the
 
00:21:58.549 --> 00:21:58.559 align:start position:0%
expenses for that road repair and if
 
00:22:01.669 --> 00:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
fema approves they have to approve all
 
00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
the parts of that
 
00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:05.669 align:start position:0%
the parts of that
submission

00:22:05.669 --> 00:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
submission
 
00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:08.320 align:start position:0%
when they approve it they only pay they
 
00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
pay you back 75
 
00:22:12.789 --> 00:22:12.799 align:start position:0%
of that expense
 
00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
the town would have to still
 
00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
be kicking in 25 percent of that which
 
00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:21.280 align:start position:0%
there's another senate bill being heard
 
00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:22.950 align:start position:0%
there's another senate bill being heard
tomorrow

00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
00:22:24.149 --> 00:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:26.480 align:start position:0%
would have that be 12 and a half
 
00:22:28.549 --> 00:22:28.559 align:start position:0%
by the town and 12 and a half by the
 
00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
state that the state would share that 25
 
00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
so but to your question
 
00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:34.310 align:start position:0%
so but to your question
um

00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:38.149 --> 00:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
the town will get 75 of whatever
 
00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
whatever fema approves
 
00:22:43.669 --> 00:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
um and then
 
00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
you know they're still in
 
00:22:46.789 --> 00:22:46.799 align:start position:0%
they're still
 
00:22:49.029 --> 00:22:49.039 align:start position:0%
responsible for the 25
 
00:22:49.039 --> 00:22:49.830 align:start position:0%
responsible for the 25
which

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
when we're looking at the millions of
 
00:22:55.669 --> 00:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
dollars worth of damage to our town 25
 
00:22:59.270 --> 00:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
percent is still a huge ginormous amount
 
00:23:01.029 --> 00:23:01.039 align:start position:0%
of money for our town to be able to
 
00:23:01.039 --> 00:23:02.310 align:start position:0%
of money for our town to be able to
absorb

00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
absorb
 
00:23:04.149 --> 00:23:04.159 align:start position:0%
i thank you for you
 
00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
thank you representative gallagher
 
00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:08.390 align:start position:0%
thank you representative gallagher
so

00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:23:10.789 --> 00:23:10.799 align:start position:0%
i um remember
 
00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:14.320 align:start position:0%
previous floods in the state um in 2005
 
00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:15.440 align:start position:0%
there was
 
00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:18.400 align:start position:0%
one in alstead and then 2006 there were
 
00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:19.350 align:start position:0%
one in alstead and then 2006 there were
some

00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:19.360 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:23:22.549 --> 00:23:22.559 align:start position:0%
in the merrimack river in general i was
 
00:23:24.149 --> 00:23:24.159 align:start position:0%
wondering if
 
00:23:26.789 --> 00:23:26.799 align:start position:0%
you could compare and contrast the
 
00:23:26.799 --> 00:23:28.470 align:start position:0%
you could compare and contrast the
2021

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:28.480 align:start position:0%
2021
 
00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:29.830 align:start position:0%
2021
floods

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
floods
 
00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
in acworth with those as well as how the
 
00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
recovery efforts
 
00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
um for them compared
 
00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
like i mean if we didn't have this fund
 
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
in 2005 or 2006 either then how did we
 
00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
recover from those
 
00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
representative gallagher
 
00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:50.720 align:start position:0%
very good question
 
00:23:53.269 --> 00:23:53.279 align:start position:0%
i was trying to find that out myself but
 
00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
from what i understand
 
00:23:58.149 --> 00:23:58.159 align:start position:0%
most of the damage that was done
 
00:23:59.430 --> 00:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
that happened
 
00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
back in that time
 
00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
were state roads
 
00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
and the state certainly had
 
00:24:07.269 --> 00:24:07.279 align:start position:0%
the money to
 
00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
do the work and recover
 
00:24:10.789 --> 00:24:10.799 align:start position:0%
a lot of the stretch of road on route to
 
00:24:13.669 --> 00:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
123 and 123a
 
00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:16.480 align:start position:0%
were the places where a roadway was
 
00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
extremely damaged and that was a result
 
00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
of from lake warren there was a breach
 
00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:24.310 align:start position:0%
of from lake warren there was a breach
that

00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:24.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
happened in uh
 
00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
some of their culverts up there
 
00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:30.640 align:start position:0%
so we had this wall of water that just
 
00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:33.200 align:start position:0%
came down the state the state roadways
 
00:24:35.909 --> 00:24:35.919 align:start position:0%
and damaged them
 
00:24:37.909 --> 00:24:37.919 align:start position:0%
in this
 
00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
flood that happened july 29th in our
 
00:24:42.789 --> 00:24:42.799 align:start position:0%
town of akworth
 
00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
we had many
 
00:24:48.149 --> 00:24:48.159 align:start position:0%
most of the roads that were damaged were
 
00:24:49.909 --> 00:24:49.919 align:start position:0%
and the damage that the town is now
 
00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:52.400 align:start position:0%
responsible for were all municipal roads
 
00:24:55.029 --> 00:24:55.039 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of
 
00:24:55.039 --> 00:24:57.029 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of
why

00:24:57.029 --> 00:24:57.039 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:24:59.510 --> 00:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
there was really no need for the towns
 
00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
back then that i understand
 
00:25:05.029 --> 00:25:05.039 align:start position:0%
to have sought help from the state in
 
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
this manner
 
00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:14.789 --> 00:25:14.799 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
00:25:14.799 --> 00:25:15.750 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
question

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
um i think it's
 
00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
certainly a duty of government to
 
00:25:23.909 --> 00:25:23.919 align:start position:0%
make available this sort of
 
00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:28.400 align:start position:0%
uh disaster relief so i am a definitely
 
00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
in favor of generally of this
 
00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
this is kind of a nitpick uh
 
00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
but on page one line 25
 
00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
you say if the amount of the total
 
00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:42.710 align:start position:0%
you say if the amount of the total
damage

00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
damage
 
00:25:45.909 --> 00:25:45.919 align:start position:0%
is greater than the municipality's
 
00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
annual municipal
 
00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:51.110 align:start position:0%
annual municipal
budget

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:51.909 align:start position:0%
 
now

00:25:51.909 --> 00:25:51.919 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:53.200 align:start position:0%
do you mean
 
00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
the annual budget for road and
 
00:25:58.230 --> 00:25:58.240 align:start position:0%
road repairs
 
00:26:01.029 --> 00:26:01.039 align:start position:0%
or their entire budget
 
00:26:03.909 --> 00:26:03.919 align:start position:0%
i was looking at the entire municipal
 
00:26:03.919 --> 00:26:05.669 align:start position:0%
i was looking at the entire municipal
budget

00:26:05.669 --> 00:26:05.679 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
in our in our town of acworth the
 
00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:10.720 align:start position:0%
municipal budget usually runs around
 
00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
1.3 million dollars
 
00:26:15.669 --> 00:26:15.679 align:start position:0%
the amount of damage that we had
 
00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
sustained in our town was well over five
 
00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
on 10 15 million dollars
 
00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:22.400 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:26:25.269 --> 00:26:25.279 align:start position:0%
it's very clear that a small town like
 
00:26:25.279 --> 00:26:26.470 align:start position:0%
it's very clear that a small town like
ours

00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
ours
 
00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:27.669 align:start position:0%
ours
uh

00:26:27.669 --> 00:26:27.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
would not be able to absorb this kind of
 
00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
damage um we could
 
00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
we had money put away certainly in our
 
00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
road and bridge funds
 
00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
uh we had money in our capital reserve
 
00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
fund certainly none of it um even
 
00:26:43.909 --> 00:26:43.919 align:start position:0%
touched the amount of money that we
 
00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
would need
 
00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
to uh cover the damages follow up mr
 
00:26:50.789 --> 00:26:50.799 align:start position:0%
chairman yes please go ahead well
 
00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
i i understand what you're saying
 
00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
but if the damage
 
00:27:01.029 --> 00:27:01.039 align:start position:0%
was a significant amount but it did not
 
00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
equal let's say it came up to 75 of the
 
00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
municipal budget
 
00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
then based upon how this is written
 
00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
unless i'm reading it wrong
 
00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:13.990 align:start position:0%
unless i'm reading it wrong
that

00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't be able to draw from this
 
00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:19.360 align:start position:0%
you see what i'm saying i do
 
00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
so i i just think that that greater than
 
00:27:26.149 --> 00:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
the municipality's annual municipal
 
00:27:26.159 --> 00:27:27.669 align:start position:0%
the municipality's annual municipal
budget

00:27:27.669 --> 00:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:27:27.679 --> 00:27:28.789 align:start position:0%
budget
is

00:27:28.789 --> 00:27:28.799 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:27:31.029 --> 00:27:31.039 align:start position:0%
kind of limiting
 
00:27:34.789 --> 00:27:34.799 align:start position:0%
uh in a in a way that would be very
 
00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
difficult to get any good out of this
 
00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:40.480 align:start position:0%
well i was also trying to take into you
 
00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
know factor in
 
00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:44.480 align:start position:0%
i wanted to put some thresholds on this
 
00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:45.590 align:start position:0%
i wanted to put some thresholds on this
certainly

00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:46.630 align:start position:0%
certainly
um

00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
and certainly to help specifically those
 
00:27:53.029 --> 00:27:53.039 align:start position:0%
communities that are really um
 
00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
don't have the tax base
 
00:27:58.070 --> 00:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
to to pay for this to absorb this kind
 
00:27:59.269 --> 00:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
of damage
 
00:27:59.279 --> 00:28:00.230 align:start position:0%
of damage
um

00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:00.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
if the committee feels that the
 
00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
thresholds that i've placed on this bill
 
00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
are a little you know too high or too
 
00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:10.720 align:start position:0%
extreme i invite you to
 
00:28:11.669 --> 00:28:11.679 align:start position:0%
make it
 
00:28:12.789 --> 00:28:12.799 align:start position:0%
a little bit
 
00:28:12.799 --> 00:28:13.590 align:start position:0%
a little bit
more

00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:28:14.549 --> 00:28:14.559 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
if you feel it's it should be more
 
00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
reasonable so to speak
 
00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:20.720 align:start position:0%
um but i am
 
00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
i feel that you know the larger
 
00:28:25.029 --> 00:28:25.039 align:start position:0%
communities the nashua's the
 
00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
manchester's certainly have the kind of
 
00:28:29.029 --> 00:28:29.039 align:start position:0%
budget that they could fix their
 
00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
municipal roads that are damaged like
 
00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:31.830 align:start position:0%
municipal roads that are damaged like
that

00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:28:34.549 --> 00:28:34.559 align:start position:0%
whereas the smaller rural towns really
 
00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:36.640 align:start position:0%
are the ones that need the help
 
00:28:39.909 --> 00:28:39.919 align:start position:0%
and um and i recognize too that at some
 
00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
point you know when there's fema money
 
00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
coming that that's going to cover 75
 
00:28:46.549 --> 00:28:46.559 align:start position:0%
percent of that that kind of damage
 
00:28:48.389 --> 00:28:48.399 align:start position:0%
depending on what they approved to pay
 
00:28:48.399 --> 00:28:49.350 align:start position:0%
depending on what they approved to pay
for

00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:49.360 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:52.720 align:start position:0%
so and that's why i i kind of laid it
 
00:28:53.909 --> 00:28:53.919 align:start position:0%
out that way
 
00:28:55.669 --> 00:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
but if like i said if the committee
 
00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
feels that
 
00:28:59.190 --> 00:28:59.200 align:start position:0%
uh some of these thresholds should be
 
00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
eased a little bit i'd be happy for that
 
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.510 align:start position:0%
eased a little bit i'd be happy for that
too

00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
too
 
00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:10.549 --> 00:29:10.559 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for bringing this
 
00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
forward and i
 
00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
i do understand that for small towns it
 
00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:18.320 align:start position:0%
must be difficult i'm i'm out of nashua
 
00:29:20.789 --> 00:29:20.799 align:start position:0%
so i'm much as you pointed out
 
00:29:22.789 --> 00:29:22.799 align:start position:0%
where we're kind of we have larger
 
00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
budgets but my questions to you are um
 
00:29:29.789 --> 00:29:29.799 align:start position:0%
it references here that it says
 
00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
manufacture wishing to draw from the
 
00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
fund in the future shall pay into the
 
00:29:36.789 --> 00:29:36.799 align:start position:0%
fund i'm sorry this is page 1 line 14.
 
00:29:38.549 --> 00:29:38.559 align:start position:0%
so i take from that that not all
 
00:29:40.789 --> 00:29:40.799 align:start position:0%
municipalities it's enabling they don't
 
00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
have to join it and so on
 
00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:45.200 align:start position:0%
but if they do how would they opt in and
 
00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
is there a um
 
00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
must be in the fund for x number of
 
00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
years before they can draw out
 
00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
i haven't stipulated anything any
 
00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
details for um
 
00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
how you know that there's a time limit
 
00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
for you to be
 
00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:04.240 align:start position:0%
uh in the fund i
 
00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:06.240 align:start position:0%
i thought that that's some details
 
00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
perhaps that
 
00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
homeland security and emergency
 
00:30:11.909 --> 00:30:11.919 align:start position:0%
management our department of safety
 
00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
would work out in rules
 
00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:15.909 align:start position:0%
would work out in rules
i

00:30:15.909 --> 00:30:15.919 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:30:18.549 --> 00:30:18.559 align:start position:0%
made it so that they would be the ones
 
00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
administering the fund
 
00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
but certainly my intention is for um
 
00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
yes it to be enabling in uh legislation
 
00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:29.360 align:start position:0%
that if a town wants to
 
00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
uh join in on on this that they can
 
00:30:34.389 --> 00:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
um because
 
00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
for instance um
 
00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
if it's in my mind so
 
00:30:42.549 --> 00:30:42.559 align:start position:0%
acworth would pay 5 000 a year into this
 
00:30:42.559 --> 00:30:43.669 align:start position:0%
acworth would pay 5 000 a year into this
fund

00:30:43.669 --> 00:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
or any other small town you know what a
 
00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
percentage of their municipal budget
 
00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
because if they were to establish a fund
 
00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
on their own
 
00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
and put five thousand dollars for
 
00:30:58.149 --> 00:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
example away every year it would take
 
00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
them decades to even
 
00:31:02.789 --> 00:31:02.799 align:start position:0%
come up with you know a substantial
 
00:31:05.669 --> 00:31:05.679 align:start position:0%
amount of money whereas if this is a
 
00:31:05.679 --> 00:31:07.509 align:start position:0%
amount of money whereas if this is a
pooled

00:31:07.509 --> 00:31:07.519 align:start position:0%
pooled
 
00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
kind of risk pool
 
00:31:12.389 --> 00:31:12.399 align:start position:0%
and the state is also contributing funds
 
00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
to it that there is going to be a more
 
00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
substantial pool to draw funds from and
 
00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:20.240 align:start position:0%
that's kind of
 
00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:22.640 align:start position:0%
how my my thought was for this are there
 
00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
00:31:27.509 --> 00:31:27.519 align:start position:0%
could i do if i could ask ask you to
 
00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:29.440 align:start position:0%
hold your questions i know we have a
 
00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
representative that's going to need to
 
00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
lead leave the hearing
 
00:31:35.269 --> 00:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
for another commitment but so we'll come
 
00:31:37.669 --> 00:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
back to representative aaron
 
00:31:39.509 --> 00:31:39.519 align:start position:0%
with your questions
 
00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
representative edwards would you like to
 
00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
join representative aaron at the
 
00:31:45.509 --> 00:31:45.519 align:start position:0%

00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
table and there are
 
00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:48.960 align:start position:0%

on the table so if you want to wipe the
 
00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:02.549 --> 00:32:02.559 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman uh i'm

auburn chester and sandown
 
00:32:09.669 --> 00:32:09.679 align:start position:0%
um i i do have another committee meeting

at 9 30 so i appreciate your indulgence
 
00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
to let me speak now i i am not a subject
 
00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
matter expert on on this topic uh i
 
00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
i i have
 
00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
uh talked a great deal about represe
 
00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
about the disaster uh out in
 
00:32:30.789 --> 00:32:30.799 align:start position:0%
representative aaron's district and
 
00:32:32.549 --> 00:32:32.559 align:start position:0%
and i'm familiar with what happened to
 
00:32:35.509 --> 00:32:35.519 align:start position:0%
my my hometown or where i grew up the
 
00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
missouri river
 
00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:38.470 align:start position:0%
missouri river
overflowed

00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:38.480 align:start position:0%
overflowed
 
00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:39.430 align:start position:0%
overflowed
uh

00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
totally took out an amazing
 
00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:43.669 align:start position:0%
totally took out an amazing
park

00:32:43.669 --> 00:32:43.679 align:start position:0%
park
 
00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
where i had
 
00:32:48.389 --> 00:32:48.399 align:start position:0%
had a lot of fun as a as a teenager
 
00:32:48.399 --> 00:32:49.590 align:start position:0%
had a lot of fun as a as a teenager
and

00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:52.240 align:start position:0%
it took absolutely years and years to
 
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
get the federal disaster relief money
 
00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:56.230 align:start position:0%
get the federal disaster relief money
and

00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:56.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:32:59.669 --> 00:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
so so that sort of opened my eyes to how
 
00:33:01.269 --> 00:33:01.279 align:start position:0%
much pain
 
00:33:04.149 --> 00:33:04.159 align:start position:0%
the slowness of the process can cause a
 
00:33:05.509 --> 00:33:05.519 align:start position:0%
local town
 
00:33:06.789 --> 00:33:06.799 align:start position:0%
and as i was thinking about
 
00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
representative aaron's issues you know
 
00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:12.720 align:start position:0%
what if a bridge had been taken out that
 
00:33:16.389 --> 00:33:16.399 align:start position:0%
kept the population cluster from being
 
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
able to get to the local emergency room
 
00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
you know the the issue there is speed
 
00:33:24.549 --> 00:33:24.559 align:start position:0%
you gotta you gotta fix some stuff fast
 
00:33:26.549 --> 00:33:26.559 align:start position:0%
and if you don't have the money you know
 
00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
no money no mission they like to say
 
00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
so uh i i support
 
00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
the creation of this revolving fund
 
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
um i
 
00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:38.720 align:start position:0%
i'm a little leery about the emphasis on
 
00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
temporary construction versus allowing
 
00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
it to go ahead and be permanent because
 
00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:46.240 align:start position:0%
in my experience you know sometimes it
 
00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:48.880 align:start position:0%
costs 60 percent to do a
 
00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
temporary job when it would only cost a
 
00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
hundred percent to do the permanent job
 
00:33:55.029 --> 00:33:55.039 align:start position:0%
and so it's pennywise pound foolish
 
00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
sometimes i think to just do temporary
 
00:33:59.750 --> 00:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
fixes but but i think i think that's
 
00:34:01.509 --> 00:34:01.519 align:start position:0%
something the committee could think
 
00:34:01.519 --> 00:34:02.950 align:start position:0%
something the committee could think
about

00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:05.440 align:start position:0%
uh this is such an obvious idea i don't
 
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
understand why it hasn't been done i
 
00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
mean we're obviously brilliant
 
00:34:11.829 --> 00:34:11.839 align:start position:0%
but there have been brilliant people in
 
00:34:14.069 --> 00:34:14.079 align:start position:0%
the state house before us and i don't
 
00:34:15.990 --> 00:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
understand why there isn't already a
 
00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
revolving fund because this is sort of a
 
00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
blinding flash of the obvious that this
 
00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
kind of thing is needed
 
00:34:25.349 --> 00:34:25.359 align:start position:0%
so so why isn't there and so it makes me
 
00:34:25.359 --> 00:34:26.310 align:start position:0%
so so why isn't there and so it makes me
wonder

00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
wonder
 
00:34:28.069 --> 00:34:28.079 align:start position:0%
you know if the federal rules get in the
 
00:34:29.349 --> 00:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
way of
 
00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:32.240 align:start position:0%
of replenishing a revolving fund is that
 
00:34:34.470 --> 00:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
is that part of the issue and just
 
00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:36.800 align:start position:0%
curious you know i i i just cited
 
00:34:39.430 --> 00:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
nebraska but nebraska doesn't have an
 
00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
account like this so i just wonder if
 
00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
there are other states uh where there's
 
00:34:45.829 --> 00:34:45.839 align:start position:0%
a precedent for this if there are no
 
00:34:47.430 --> 00:34:47.440 align:start position:0%
other states then maybe there is an
 
00:34:49.349 --> 00:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
issue with the federal rules
 
00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
um and then it wasn't clear to me as as
 
00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
i looked at it and i should have
 
00:34:55.829 --> 00:34:55.839 align:start position:0%
provided this input to
 
00:34:58.550 --> 00:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
the sponsor earlier but i i i don't
 
00:35:01.589 --> 00:35:01.599 align:start position:0%
understand what happens if uh the fund
 
00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
uh wants to exceed 30 million so you
 
00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
know what if they're you know we're
 
00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
flush with cash and the towns keep
 
00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
wanting to pay in what happens to
 
00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
the 31st million dollar i don't know
 
00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
so um so i i really hope the uh
 
00:35:19.589 --> 00:35:19.599 align:start position:0%
committee with all your expertise
 
00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
figures uh you you know the smart way to
 
00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
do this because uh the the need is there
 
00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:26.470 align:start position:0%
do this because uh the the need is there
so

00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
um i i'll take questions if there are
 
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:36.160 align:start position:0%
i'm seeing no questions i i had a
 
00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
question or comment from representative
 
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:41.440 align:start position:0%
aaron's we've had it was my intention
 
00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
so may i be excused yes all right thank
 
00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
you i had a uh
 
00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
thought that
 
00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
we this is this is an early bill so i
 
00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
had a thought that we might
 
00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
exec this bill this morning
 
00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
instead of just hearing it but
 
00:35:58.630 --> 00:35:58.640 align:start position:0%
with the uh
 
00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
issues that have brought up so far about
 
00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:01.589 align:start position:0%
issues that have brought up so far about
the

00:36:01.589 --> 00:36:01.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:05.200 align:start position:0%
the finance number
 
00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh would it would it be
 
00:36:09.349 --> 00:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
we could i can postpone the exact
 
00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
portion of this
 
00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
to give you an opportunity
 
00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
to make an amendment to
 
00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
incorporate that change is that a
 
00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
reasonable thing to do
 
00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
that would be fine i know um
 
00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
i mean even if you want to execute and
 
00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
then i can draw up an amendment so that
 
00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:28.640 align:start position:0%
it can go the amendment can go to the
 
00:36:30.069 --> 00:36:30.079 align:start position:0%
finance committee
 
00:36:30.079 --> 00:36:31.190 align:start position:0%
finance committee
um

00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:33.200 align:start position:0%
but i i also had a suggestion from
 
00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:34.720 align:start position:0%
senator gaida
 
00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
uh that he wanted to
 
00:36:39.349 --> 00:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
because you know this he's expecting it
 
00:36:41.589 --> 00:36:41.599 align:start position:0%
to come to the senate as well and
 
00:36:41.599 --> 00:36:42.790 align:start position:0%
to come to the senate as well and
um

00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
he said that uh he would like to see the
 
00:36:47.589 --> 00:36:47.599 align:start position:0%
effective date uh be
 
00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
taking effect
 
00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
upon you know passage
 
00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:59.750 --> 00:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
he believes that the uh
 
00:37:02.069 --> 00:37:02.079 align:start position:0%
let me see he gave me another suggestion
 
00:37:02.079 --> 00:37:03.109 align:start position:0%
let me see he gave me another suggestion
on

00:37:03.109 --> 00:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:37:03.119 --> 00:37:04.150 align:start position:0%
on
um

00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
he believed that the it should be 50 of
 
00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
the municipal budget
 
00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:09.589 align:start position:0%
the municipal budget
uh

00:37:09.589 --> 00:37:09.599 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
instead of the
 
00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
on line twenty four page one
 
00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:15.440 align:start position:0%
um that the municipality may only draw
 
00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:16.720 align:start position:0%
from the municipal road and bridge
 
00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
disaster relief fund if the amount of
 
00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
the total damage is fifty percent of the
 
00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
municipalities annual municipal budget
 
00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
so he again he wanted to lower that
 
00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
threshold as well
 
00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
so i'd be happy to draft an amendment uh
 
00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
you know to this
 
00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:33.190 align:start position:0%
you know to this
bill

00:37:33.190 --> 00:37:33.200 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:35.200 align:start position:0%
if you want to wait for me to do that
 
00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
and then exec that's fine if you want to
 
00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
exec the bill the way it is and then
 
00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
have me submit changes to finance i'd be
 
00:37:44.310 --> 00:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
happy to do that as well
 
00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:46.470 align:start position:0%
happy to do that as well
okay

00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:52.720 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
um i share your concern about um
 
00:37:59.349 --> 00:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
on page one line 24 about having it
 
00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:02.480 align:start position:0%
exceed the town's municipal budget
 
00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:04.400 align:start position:0%
but i would actually
 
00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:06.470 align:start position:0%
but i would actually
um

00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
be curious about your ideas about
 
00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
striking from
 
00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:14.320 align:start position:0%
line 22 through line 27 because
 
00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
it doesn't seem as though
 
00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
just drawing once a year is relevant if
 
00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:21.440 align:start position:0%
if you have a major flood
 
00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
major damage and then eight months later
 
00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
you have it again
 
00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:27.430 align:start position:0%
you have it again
um

00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:27.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:29.349 --> 00:38:29.359 align:start position:0%
but then you're you can't fix those
 
00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:30.640 align:start position:0%
roads a second time because you've
 
00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
already drawn from the fund it seems as
 
00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
though it should just continue
 
00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
to cover any natural disaster damage
 
00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
regardless of if it happens in the same
 
00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:44.640 align:start position:0%
year or not that was roman numeral three
 
00:38:47.829 --> 00:38:47.839 align:start position:0%
and then getting to your point too
 
00:38:47.839 --> 00:38:49.270 align:start position:0%
and then getting to your point too
um

00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
you know fixing let's say a two mile
 
00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:54.640 align:start position:0%
stretch of road for a very small town
 
00:38:56.069 --> 00:38:56.079 align:start position:0%
like yours
 
00:38:59.270 --> 00:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
will have a much bigger impact on
 
00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:00.390 align:start position:0%
will have a much bigger impact on
um

00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
on your access to that money well
 
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
actually it would probably have a bigger
 
00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
impact on a town with a larger budget
 
00:39:06.069 --> 00:39:06.079 align:start position:0%
because they have to exceed the
 
00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
threshold of their total municipal
 
00:39:09.589 --> 00:39:09.599 align:start position:0%
budget so
 
00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
i agree
 
00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
i i don't even know if that's that line
 
00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:14.560 align:start position:0%
is necessary
 
00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:17.200 align:start position:0%
um and then one other thing if you can
 
00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:18.640 align:start position:0%
indulge me
 
00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
it's not in this bill but one of my
 
00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
concerns reading it is that if a town
 
00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't do proper maintenance on their
 
00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
roads they may be more susceptible to
 
00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
damage from a natural disaster
 
00:39:35.109 --> 00:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
would that be a consideration in
 
00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:41.829 --> 00:39:41.839 align:start position:0%
i hadn't really thought of that you know
 
00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
that's a good point um
 
00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
certainly a small town is going to
 
00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
struggle to keep their roads maintained
 
00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
to begin with i mean in acworth we have
 
00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
66 miles of road in our small town
 
00:39:59.190 --> 00:39:59.200 align:start position:0%
and certainly the tax base is not robust
 
00:40:01.829 --> 00:40:01.839 align:start position:0%
enough to maintain all of those roads
 
00:40:01.839 --> 00:40:03.109 align:start position:0%
enough to maintain all of those roads
properly

00:40:03.109 --> 00:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
properly
 
00:40:03.119 --> 00:40:03.910 align:start position:0%
properly
um

00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
we've struggled with that
 
00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
and and have you know a significant
 
00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
amount of our budget every year does go
 
00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
to road maintenance i would venture to
 
00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
say probably a good
 
00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
65 to 70 percent of our town municipal
 
00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
budget is roads
 
00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:28.240 align:start position:0%
we try best we can to maintain them all
 
00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:29.270 align:start position:0%
we try best we can to maintain them all
um

00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:30.640 align:start position:0%
some of them we
 
00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
feel that well you know what let's just
 
00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
re leave them gravel or dirt roads
 
00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
rather than paving them because paving
 
00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
them you have to maintain with
 
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
you know top coats and and make sure
 
00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:42.470 align:start position:0%
you know top coats and and make sure
that

00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
every the culverts are cleared and all
 
00:40:47.589 --> 00:40:47.599 align:start position:0%
these other uh activities as municipal
 
00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:48.800 align:start position:0%
people you should
 
00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
certainly be aware of that
 
00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
so i i you know i don't i don't know um
 
00:40:57.430 --> 00:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
if we can or should put that kind of uh
 
00:40:59.270 --> 00:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
caveat in there that if
 
00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
what based on your road maintenance
 
00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:02.720 align:start position:0%
program or whether your roads are being
 
00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
maintained properly
 
00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:05.589 align:start position:0%
maintained properly
um

00:41:05.589 --> 00:41:05.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
certainly that could be a contributory
 
00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
issue when there's uh
 
00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
a disaster or
 
00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:14.480 align:start position:0%
storms or floods
 
00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:16.630 align:start position:0%
storms or floods
uh

00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:16.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
one of the other problems that we had
 
00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
when crane brook road was totally
 
00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
destroyed a three and a half mile
 
00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
stretch of road
 
00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
was that a beaver bam beaver dam broke a
 
00:41:30.069 --> 00:41:30.079 align:start position:0%
couple of beaver dams broke from one of
 
00:41:31.829 --> 00:41:31.839 align:start position:0%
the beaver bogs up there
 
00:41:33.349 --> 00:41:33.359 align:start position:0%
and that contributed to the volume of
 
00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
water that was coming down that roadway
 
00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:37.030 align:start position:0%
water that was coming down that roadway
so

00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
you know do we also include in here you
 
00:41:42.309 --> 00:41:42.319 align:start position:0%
know your local water management i mean
 
00:41:43.829 --> 00:41:43.839 align:start position:0%
it's there's a lot of things that
 
00:41:46.069 --> 00:41:46.079 align:start position:0%
contribute to why these floods cause
 
00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
these kinds of damage okay thank you
 
00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
very much sure
 
00:41:53.349 --> 00:41:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:55.589 --> 00:41:55.599 align:start position:0%
representative guthrie thank you mr
 
00:41:57.510 --> 00:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you again for taking the
 
00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
question um it seems that from
 
00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
the comments that
 
00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
some members of the committee feel that
 
00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
this is restrictive
 
00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
uh making it more difficult for you to
 
00:42:11.349 --> 00:42:11.359 align:start position:0%
get that gap money when you're looking
 
00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:17.589 --> 00:42:17.599 align:start position:0%
uh amendment if you put in an amendment
 
00:42:21.109 --> 00:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
would you look on page two the first uh
 
00:42:24.309 --> 00:42:24.319 align:start position:0%
eight pages i wonder how quickly
 
00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
you could get
 
00:42:28.069 --> 00:42:28.079 align:start position:0%
the funds that you need for the roads if
 
00:42:31.270 --> 00:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
in fact this passes with the amount of
 
00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
uh effort you have to put in before you
 
00:42:35.349 --> 00:42:35.359 align:start position:0%
can get any money particularly the
 
00:42:35.359 --> 00:42:36.710 align:start position:0%
can get any money particularly the
engineering

00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:36.720 align:start position:0%
engineering
 
00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
uh i don't know how long that takes
 
00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
just uh does this my question i guess is
 
00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
to you is is that that area from page
 
00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
one to nine which really puts what
 
00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
you have to do before you get any funds
 
00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:52.480 align:start position:0%
do you feel that that is more
 
00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:53.670 align:start position:0%
do you feel that that is more
restrictive

00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
restrictive
 
00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh than you want it and would you look
 
00:43:00.069 --> 00:43:00.079 align:start position:0%
at that when you make the amendment
 
00:43:00.079 --> 00:43:00.870 align:start position:0%
at that when you make the amendment
uh

00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:43:02.069 --> 00:43:02.079 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:43:02.079 --> 00:43:02.870 align:start position:0%
you know
when

00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
when the thank you for your question and
 
00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
to your point when we had all this
 
00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
damage happen
 
00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
we quickly got
 
00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
a town engineer involved to go down
 
00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:18.640 align:start position:0%
assess the damage see where we needed to
 
00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:22.240 align:start position:0%
get uh work done quickly so
 
00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:23.030 align:start position:0%
get uh work done quickly so
i

00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:43:25.109 --> 00:43:25.119 align:start position:0%
i thought that you know it
 
00:43:29.109 --> 00:43:29.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
occurrence of events of these items to
 
00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:33.030 align:start position:0%
occurrence of events of these items to
be

00:43:33.030 --> 00:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:43:35.349 --> 00:43:35.359 align:start position:0%
uh be able to be presented fairly
 
00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
quickly anyway because you're going to
 
00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
have an engineer take a look at the
 
00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
roads or even your road crew
 
00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:44.720 align:start position:0%
and by the way in the town of akworth we
 
00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
had exactly
 
00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
three people three four people
 
00:43:51.349 --> 00:43:51.359 align:start position:0%
employed in our road crew it was the
 
00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
supervisor or the road the road agent
 
00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:56.640 align:start position:0%
and i don't know if it was two or three
 
00:43:59.349 --> 00:43:59.359 align:start position:0%
people who was uh working with him
 
00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
so obviously we had
 
00:44:04.069 --> 00:44:04.079 align:start position:0%
you know very small crew
 
00:44:06.069 --> 00:44:06.079 align:start position:0%
involved in trying to get all these
 
00:44:07.589 --> 00:44:07.599 align:start position:0%
roads uh
 
00:44:09.670 --> 00:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
see which roads were out which roads
 
00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:10.550 align:start position:0%
see which roads were out which roads
needed

00:44:10.550 --> 00:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
needed
 
00:44:13.829 --> 00:44:13.839 align:start position:0%
priority in priority
 
00:44:15.670 --> 00:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
to see which roads needed to be put back
 
00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
together as best they could
 
00:44:20.069 --> 00:44:20.079 align:start position:0%
for emergency vehicle purposes and so
 
00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:22.720 align:start position:0%
forth so we had you know an assessment
 
00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
report uh that was prepared by our road
 
00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:27.670 align:start position:0%
report uh that was prepared by our road
engineer

00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
engineer
 
00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
outlining what the temporary repairs
 
00:44:30.790 --> 00:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
were going to be
 
00:44:33.109 --> 00:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
which roads needed work quickly
 
00:44:36.309 --> 00:44:36.319 align:start position:0%
that was almost done
 
00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:38.640 align:start position:0%
you know within a week or two
 
00:44:40.870 --> 00:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
and then uh to to send a letter to the
 
00:44:42.309 --> 00:44:42.319 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the department of safety
 
00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
and director of division of homeland
 
00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:44.870 align:start position:0%
and director of division of homeland
security

00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
security
 
00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh requesting the amount needed to
 
00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
you know that you could be able to tell
 
00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
them we need
 
00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
five hundred thousand dollars right now
 
00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
to fix this
 
00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:56.240 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:44:57.750 --> 00:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
in a demonstration that the roads are
 
00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:00.880 align:start position:0%
bridges due to natural damaged uh were
 
00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
of critical importance obviously you
 
00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
know if you have roads that
 
00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh are not passable and you have to have
 
00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
emergency vehicles to get through them
 
00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
that's going to be
 
00:45:13.829 --> 00:45:13.839 align:start position:0%
you know you'd be able to demonstrate
 
00:45:16.309 --> 00:45:16.319 align:start position:0%
that pretty quickly so
 
00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:18.640 align:start position:0%
you know i think that the uh funds would
 
00:45:22.069 --> 00:45:22.079 align:start position:0%
be able to be disbursed to a town fairly
 
00:45:24.309 --> 00:45:24.319 align:start position:0%
quickly once they know what the damages
 
00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
that they're dealing with thank you very
 
00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:28.240 align:start position:0%
much for you thank you mr chairman mr
 
00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
00:45:31.829 --> 00:45:31.839 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
00:45:34.390 --> 00:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
00:45:37.109 --> 00:45:37.119 align:start position:0%
um i have a concern with regard to a
 
00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
term on page two line one
 
00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
and that is the um
 
00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
reference to a certified road engineer
 
00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
so within within civil engineering
 
00:45:51.829 --> 00:45:51.839 align:start position:0%
road engineers in bridge engineers are
 
00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
different areas of specialty
 
00:45:56.309 --> 00:45:56.319 align:start position:0%
so my concern is um
 
00:45:59.270 --> 00:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
that's very specific road engineer and
 
00:46:02.150 --> 00:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
in the line two it also goes on to say
 
00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
that this certified road engineer will
 
00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:06.710 align:start position:0%
that this certified road engineer will
um

00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
be assessing damage to roads and bridges
 
00:46:11.829 --> 00:46:11.839 align:start position:0%
so my question is do you agree that
 
00:46:14.550 --> 00:46:14.560 align:start position:0%
perhaps it would might be better
 
00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:15.349 align:start position:0%
perhaps it would might be better
to

00:46:15.349 --> 00:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:46:18.870 --> 00:46:18.880 align:start position:0%
cite a professional engineer
 
00:46:20.790 --> 00:46:20.800 align:start position:0%
because that would
 
00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:22.960 align:start position:0%
that that would imply
 
00:46:25.589 --> 00:46:25.599 align:start position:0%
a professionally licensed
 
00:46:27.829 --> 00:46:27.839 align:start position:0%
civil engineer and that that would be
 
00:46:27.839 --> 00:46:28.950 align:start position:0%
civil engineer and that that would be
more

00:46:28.950 --> 00:46:28.960 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:30.710 align:start position:0%
more
comprehensive

00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
comprehensive
 
00:46:32.309 --> 00:46:32.319 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:34.480 align:start position:0%
assessing roads and bridges sure that's
 
00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
more questions yes representative clean
 
00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:44.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and um
 
00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
my question goes on to what i had
 
00:46:49.109 --> 00:46:49.119 align:start position:0%
originally um
 
00:46:51.589 --> 00:46:51.599 align:start position:0%
spoke about about the uh how they would
 
00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
how municipalities would opt in
 
00:46:56.630 --> 00:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
um i i do have a concern while i think
 
00:46:58.790 --> 00:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
this is a great
 
00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:00.640 align:start position:0%
fund i think it's it really is a good
 
00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
idea my concern is that can
 
00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities be able to opt in and opt
 
00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
i i guess it's kind of like we only want
 
00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
insurance when we get to a point where
 
00:47:15.109 --> 00:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
we're going to need insurance
 
00:47:18.069 --> 00:47:18.079 align:start position:0%
would it be better to um
 
00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
and i say this in reading the the last
 
00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
page where it says that the new
 
00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire municipality association
 
00:47:25.349 --> 00:47:25.359 align:start position:0%
indicates that if every municipality in
 
00:47:27.109 --> 00:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
the state did it it would be eight
 
00:47:29.190 --> 00:47:29.200 align:start position:0%
million dollars in annual revenue but
 
00:47:31.829 --> 00:47:31.839 align:start position:0%
would it not be better to
 
00:47:34.069 --> 00:47:34.079 align:start position:0%
almost say that municipalities with a
 
00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
budget an annual budget less than
 
00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
x amount of dollars because we know that
 
00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
they would have a hard time
 
00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:41.910 align:start position:0%
they would have a hard time
um

00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
kind of compelling those not making it
 
00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:46.880 align:start position:0%
so much enabling um i guess i'm just i'm
 
00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
just concerned that municipalities are
 
00:47:50.309 --> 00:47:50.319 align:start position:0%
going to come in and out and in and out
 
00:47:53.109 --> 00:47:53.119 align:start position:0%
of this fund as as they feel that their
 
00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
budget would warrant it thank you for
 
00:47:56.630 --> 00:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
your question and that that's a good
 
00:47:58.069 --> 00:47:58.079 align:start position:0%
point i
 
00:48:00.549 --> 00:48:00.559 align:start position:0%
i kind of thought of this in the same
 
00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
way as we have our um
 
00:48:07.829 --> 00:48:07.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:09.109 --> 00:48:09.119 align:start position:0%
what's it called
 
00:48:10.549 --> 00:48:10.559 align:start position:0%
for the for the
 
00:48:10.559 --> 00:48:12.069 align:start position:0%
for the for the
road

00:48:12.069 --> 00:48:12.079 align:start position:0%
road
 
00:48:14.390 --> 00:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
it's a road mutual aid
 
00:48:16.330 --> 00:48:16.340 align:start position:0%
association throughout the
 
00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:17.750 align:start position:0%
association throughout the
[Music]

00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:48:19.349 --> 00:48:19.359 align:start position:0%
from the d.o.t
 
00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
they have um
 
00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
i forget the name of it but it's it's a
 
00:48:25.270 --> 00:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
it's a fund that
 
00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
it's not a fund but it is if you need um
 
00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:31.430 align:start position:0%
it's not a fund but it is if you need um
signage

00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
signage
 
00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:32.630 align:start position:0%
signage
or

00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:32.640 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:48:36.150 --> 00:48:36.160 align:start position:0%
um barriers or some sort of thing it's
 
00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
it's a mutual aid that you can go
 
00:48:41.589 --> 00:48:41.599 align:start position:0%
you have to join it
 
00:48:43.270 --> 00:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
uh it's sort of like i think fifty
 
00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
dollars a year that they charge
 
00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities to be a part of this
 
00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
mutual aid association
 
00:48:51.589 --> 00:48:51.599 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
when we found it
 
00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
when we found out that you know we
 
00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:56.630 align:start position:0%
when we found out that you know we
needed

00:48:56.630 --> 00:48:56.640 align:start position:0%
needed
 
00:48:58.230 --> 00:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
road signage and that kind of thing and
 
00:49:00.829 --> 00:49:00.839 align:start position:0%
that could not be
 
00:49:04.230 --> 00:49:04.240 align:start position:0%
um given to us by department of
 
00:49:06.069 --> 00:49:06.079 align:start position:0%
transportation for whatever reason they
 
00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
were they were busy off doing all their
 
00:49:09.589 --> 00:49:09.599 align:start position:0%
repairs too
 
00:49:13.829 --> 00:49:13.839 align:start position:0%
but uh this mutual aid association
 
00:49:13.839 --> 00:49:14.829 align:start position:0%
but uh this mutual aid association
is

00:49:14.829 --> 00:49:14.839 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:49:18.549 --> 00:49:18.559 align:start position:0%
uh available if you pay into it
 
00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
now they don't
 
00:49:22.549 --> 00:49:22.559 align:start position:0%
they will allow you to pay into it even
 
00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
after the damage happened last week
 
00:49:28.230 --> 00:49:28.240 align:start position:0%
so that you can access a
 
00:49:30.790 --> 00:49:30.800 align:start position:0%
list of names and so forth of contacts
 
00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:33.680 align:start position:0%
to other towns who could help you out if
 
00:49:36.309 --> 00:49:36.319 align:start position:0%
you needed sand or
 
00:49:38.069 --> 00:49:38.079 align:start position:0%
signage or something
 
00:49:39.829 --> 00:49:39.839 align:start position:0%
and so that's what i was kind of
 
00:49:42.150 --> 00:49:42.160 align:start position:0%
thinking when i when i put that wording
 
00:49:43.750 --> 00:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
in here
 
00:49:45.829 --> 00:49:45.839 align:start position:0%
but certainly
 
00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
the rulemaking that homeland security
 
00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
emergency management could come up with
 
00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:52.870 align:start position:0%
emergency management could come up with
this

00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:54.720 align:start position:0%
you know if they
 
00:49:57.109 --> 00:49:57.119 align:start position:0%
we could probably make some tweaks to
 
00:49:57.119 --> 00:49:58.630 align:start position:0%
we could probably make some tweaks to
that

00:49:58.630 --> 00:49:58.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:50:01.030 --> 00:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i mean yeah i
 
00:50:02.710 --> 00:50:02.720 align:start position:0%
absolutely understand that you know you
 
00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
don't want to buy insurance just when
 
00:50:05.829 --> 00:50:05.839 align:start position:0%
you need it you have to have that in
 
00:50:07.589 --> 00:50:07.599 align:start position:0%
place thank you
 
00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:50:16.230 --> 00:50:16.240 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh
 
00:50:18.309 --> 00:50:18.319 align:start position:0%
i have uh
 
00:50:20.390 --> 00:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
a question about the uh
 
00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
page page 2 line 16
 
00:50:25.510 --> 00:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
where uh you're going to be adopting
 
00:50:27.109 --> 00:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
interim rules
 
00:50:29.349 --> 00:50:29.359 align:start position:0%
uh there's no mention of when final
 
00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
rules would be required
 
00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
i think interim rules are fine but uh
 
00:50:36.870 --> 00:50:36.880 align:start position:0%
you probably don't want to live 30 years
 
00:50:38.549 --> 00:50:38.559 align:start position:0%
with interim rules
 
00:50:38.559 --> 00:50:39.349 align:start position:0%
with interim rules
so

00:50:39.349 --> 00:50:39.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:50:41.589 --> 00:50:41.599 align:start position:0%
when if you're making a uh amendment i
 
00:50:43.829 --> 00:50:43.839 align:start position:0%
would suggest this is not a question is
 
00:50:45.109 --> 00:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
it would you
 
00:50:47.109 --> 00:50:47.119 align:start position:0%
agree that probably
 
00:50:47.119 --> 00:50:48.069 align:start position:0%
agree that probably
uh

00:50:48.069 --> 00:50:48.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:50:51.270 --> 00:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
requiring final rules is a good idea
 
00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:54.790 align:start position:0%
requiring final rules is a good idea
yes

00:50:54.790 --> 00:50:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:57.829 --> 00:50:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
00:51:02.790 --> 00:51:02.800 align:start position:0%
we uh we have a couple more people to
 
00:51:05.670 --> 00:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
testify but just so i don't lose track
 
00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
here representative aaron's i've i've
 
00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:10.069 align:start position:0%
here representative aaron's i've i've
made

00:51:10.069 --> 00:51:10.079 align:start position:0%
made
 
00:51:12.069 --> 00:51:12.079 align:start position:0%
notes that this might need four
 
00:51:14.230 --> 00:51:14.240 align:start position:0%
amendments okay
 
00:51:17.829 --> 00:51:17.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:27.349 --> 00:51:27.359 align:start position:0%
the the language about engineers
 
00:51:28.870 --> 00:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
and also about
 
00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:30.470 align:start position:0%
and also about
rules

00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
rules
 
00:51:32.870 --> 00:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
so i so that's those are the four so far
 
00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
that i have
 
00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:35.109 align:start position:0%
that i have
um

00:51:35.109 --> 00:51:35.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:35.119 --> 00:51:35.910 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:51:35.910 --> 00:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:51:38.790 --> 00:51:38.800 align:start position:0%
with that many changes i'm reluctant to
 
00:51:40.390 --> 00:51:40.400 align:start position:0%
pass it with
 
00:51:42.069 --> 00:51:42.079 align:start position:0%
those defects in it
 
00:51:44.230 --> 00:51:44.240 align:start position:0%
uh hoping someone else will make this
 
00:51:47.670 --> 00:51:47.680 align:start position:0%
change so what i would be looking for is
 
00:51:48.870 --> 00:51:48.880 align:start position:0%
could you
 
00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
put an amendment in to capture those
 
00:51:52.870 --> 00:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
four things
 
00:51:55.109 --> 00:51:55.119 align:start position:0%
and have it back to us by friday oh
 
00:51:55.119 --> 00:51:56.390 align:start position:0%
and have it back to us by friday oh
absolutely

00:51:56.390 --> 00:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
00:51:59.430 --> 00:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh you know barring any kind of problem
 
00:52:00.790 --> 00:52:00.800 align:start position:0%
uh with
 
00:52:03.510 --> 00:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
the workload in drafting but certainly i
 
00:52:05.910 --> 00:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
will put something together today and
 
00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
and send it back to them okay i'd like
 
00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
to get a uh i see your hand
 
00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
representative power but i'd like to get
 
00:52:12.470 --> 00:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
a couple more people
 
00:52:13.990 --> 00:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
up in front of the microphone we're
 
00:52:16.069 --> 00:52:16.079 align:start position:0%
going to be getting out of time if you
 
00:52:16.079 --> 00:52:16.870 align:start position:0%
going to be getting out of time if you
can

00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:52:20.069 --> 00:52:20.079 align:start position:0%
hold that and maybe wrap it into a
 
00:52:23.109 --> 00:52:23.119 align:start position:0%
question for the next person to come up
 
00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
unless it's something real quick
 
00:52:27.190 --> 00:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair it is real quick with
 
00:52:28.710 --> 00:52:28.720 align:start position:0%
regard to your list
 
00:52:31.589 --> 00:52:31.599 align:start position:0%
for the um possible amendment
 
00:52:34.470 --> 00:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
did you forget um a correction of that
 
00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:35.910 align:start position:0%
did you forget um a correction of that
percentage

00:52:35.910 --> 00:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
percentage
 
00:52:37.430 --> 00:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
because that's how i put dollar amount
 
00:52:39.670 --> 00:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
yeah okay thank you
 
00:52:42.790 --> 00:52:42.800 align:start position:0%
uh okay let's uh let's move forward and
 
00:52:45.829 --> 00:52:45.839 align:start position:0%
uh ask representative
 
00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
take the microphone
 
00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative thank you very
 
00:52:51.829 --> 00:52:51.839 align:start position:0%
much and i appreciate all your time and
 
00:52:53.829 --> 00:52:53.839 align:start position:0%
looking at this and
 
00:52:57.030 --> 00:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
helping me refine this to be a better
 
00:52:58.710 --> 00:52:58.720 align:start position:0%
bill i mean
 
00:53:00.870 --> 00:53:00.880 align:start position:0%
this was really totally new territory
 
00:53:02.069 --> 00:53:02.079 align:start position:0%
for me
 
00:53:04.230 --> 00:53:04.240 align:start position:0%
but i just know that our towns are small
 
00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
towns especially
 
00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
in a disaster such as this
 
00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:10.720 align:start position:0%
really and truly do need assistance from
 
00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
the state when something like this
 
00:53:13.589 --> 00:53:13.599 align:start position:0%
happens so
 
00:53:15.349 --> 00:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very very much for your
 
00:53:17.109 --> 00:53:17.119 align:start position:0%
attention on it
 
00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:28.069 --> 00:53:28.079 align:start position:0%
the floor is usa representative thank
 
00:53:29.829 --> 00:53:29.839 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman members of the committee
 
00:53:31.829 --> 00:53:31.839 align:start position:0%
representative ken weiler
 
00:53:34.230 --> 00:53:34.240 align:start position:0%
rockingham 13 the towns of hampstead and
 
00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:35.750 align:start position:0%
rockingham 13 the towns of hampstead and
kingston

00:53:35.750 --> 00:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
kingston
 
00:53:38.069 --> 00:53:38.079 align:start position:0%
uh it's difficult to plan for disasters
 
00:53:39.910 --> 00:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
past experience has shown that very few
 
00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:42.400 align:start position:0%
of them happened as expected the
 
00:53:44.069 --> 00:53:44.079 align:start position:0%
disruption of the infrastructure caused
 
00:53:46.309 --> 00:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
by disasters has had too many delays
 
00:53:48.309 --> 00:53:48.319 align:start position:0%
many of the delays deal with who can
 
00:53:50.069 --> 00:53:50.079 align:start position:0%
begin mitigation and how will that
 
00:53:51.670 --> 00:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
entity be paid
 
00:53:53.589 --> 00:53:53.599 align:start position:0%
by establishing a fund that can be used
 
00:53:55.990 --> 00:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
immediately to begin restoration efforts
 
00:53:58.069 --> 00:53:58.079 align:start position:0%
we can hope to improve response times
 
00:53:59.349 --> 00:53:59.359 align:start position:0%
and minimize
 
00:53:59.359 --> 00:54:01.190 align:start position:0%
and minimize
disruptions

00:54:01.190 --> 00:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
disruptions
 
00:54:02.630 --> 00:54:02.640 align:start position:0%
i believe the funds are available to
 
00:54:04.230 --> 00:54:04.240 align:start position:0%
begin funding this proposal and the
 
00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
municipal contributions envisioned will
 
00:54:08.549 --> 00:54:08.559 align:start position:0%
maintain it for the long run
 
00:54:10.150 --> 00:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
if we do not begin mitigation
 
00:54:12.069 --> 00:54:12.079 align:start position:0%
immediately the damage is sure to become
 
00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
worse than when it first discovered
 
00:54:16.309 --> 00:54:16.319 align:start position:0%
homeland security and emergency
 
00:54:17.990 --> 00:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
management would be the obvious place
 
00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
for this fund to be managed and the
 
00:54:21.829 --> 00:54:21.839 align:start position:0%
place for the most expertise to be found
 
00:54:24.069 --> 00:54:24.079 align:start position:0%
i hope that you will support the bill
 
00:54:26.150 --> 00:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
thank you i also noticed when i was
 
00:54:27.990 --> 00:54:28.000 align:start position:0%
going over it last night
 
00:54:31.030 --> 00:54:31.040 align:start position:0%
that .005
 
00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:32.390 align:start position:0%
that .005
percent

00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:33.990 align:start position:0%
percent
um

00:54:33.990 --> 00:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:35.270 --> 00:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
and also the
 
00:54:38.470 --> 00:54:38.480 align:start position:0%
the talk a municipal budget
 
00:54:40.630 --> 00:54:40.640 align:start position:0%
my town has a municipal budget total
 
00:54:43.030 --> 00:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
budget of like say 20 million
 
00:54:45.750 --> 00:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
15 million of it goes to the schools
 
00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:47.030 align:start position:0%
15 million of it goes to the schools
five

00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
five
 
00:54:49.270 --> 00:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
four five six million goes to run the
 
00:54:51.190 --> 00:54:51.200 align:start position:0%
town and another million goes to the
 
00:54:54.630 --> 00:54:54.640 align:start position:0%
county so which piece are we
 
00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
putting this stipend on are we putting
 
00:54:59.910 --> 00:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
it on the 20 million or the 5 million
 
00:55:02.069 --> 00:55:02.079 align:start position:0%
that's really in fact the municipal
 
00:55:03.829 --> 00:55:03.839 align:start position:0%
budget so i don't know if we need
 
00:55:06.069 --> 00:55:06.079 align:start position:0%
tweaking to say what a municipal budget
 
00:55:06.079 --> 00:55:07.670 align:start position:0%
tweaking to say what a municipal budget
is

00:55:07.670 --> 00:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:55:09.950 --> 00:55:09.960 align:start position:0%
and even then
 
00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:11.829 align:start position:0%
and even then
.005

00:55:11.829 --> 00:55:11.839 align:start position:0%
.005
 
00:55:11.839 --> 00:55:13.990 align:start position:0%
.005
um

00:55:13.990 --> 00:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:15.349 --> 00:55:15.359 align:start position:0%
if it was
 
00:55:18.870 --> 00:55:18.880 align:start position:0%
.005 times the budget it's like 5 000
 
00:55:20.549 --> 00:55:20.559 align:start position:0%
for every million
 
00:55:21.589 --> 00:55:21.599 align:start position:0%
i believe
 
00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
we recognize the fact that there's okay
 
00:55:25.109 --> 00:55:25.119 align:start position:0%
decimal point error probably in there
 
00:55:27.030 --> 00:55:27.040 align:start position:0%
yeah and we'll be looking at it again if
 
00:55:28.870 --> 00:55:28.880 align:start position:0%
it gets to finance to just to figure out
 
00:55:31.349 --> 00:55:31.359 align:start position:0%
how much money would and i see that uh
 
00:55:33.829 --> 00:55:33.839 align:start position:0%
municipal association thinks 8 million
 
00:55:35.750 --> 00:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
dollars a year would come in and i i can
 
00:55:37.589 --> 00:55:37.599 align:start position:0%
probably believe that depending on what
 
00:55:38.710 --> 00:55:38.720 align:start position:0%
part of the budget you're really
 
00:55:40.950 --> 00:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
multiplying this figure by them whether
 
00:55:42.789 --> 00:55:42.799 align:start position:0%
using .005
 
00:55:45.190 --> 00:55:45.200 align:start position:0%
times the budget of 0.005
 
00:55:46.230 --> 00:55:46.240 align:start position:0%
which is
 
00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
100 times less so anyway
 
00:55:50.789 --> 00:55:50.799 align:start position:0%
there's there's those few things that
 
00:55:52.150 --> 00:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
that i'm
 
00:55:54.309 --> 00:55:54.319 align:start position:0%
happy that the committee
 
00:55:55.829 --> 00:55:55.839 align:start position:0%
found right away
 
00:55:57.829 --> 00:55:57.839 align:start position:0%
and uh you know i
 
00:55:59.670 --> 00:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
i've been doing this for 30 plus years
 
00:56:01.829 --> 00:56:01.839 align:start position:0%
and i've seen about every 10 or 15 years
 
00:56:03.589 --> 00:56:03.599 align:start position:0%
as a disaster
 
00:56:03.599 --> 00:56:04.710 align:start position:0%
as a disaster
and

00:56:04.710 --> 00:56:04.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:56:05.829 --> 00:56:05.839 align:start position:0%
it's always
 
00:56:07.829 --> 00:56:07.839 align:start position:0%
never repeated the same way and
 
00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:10.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's a river sometimes it's a
 
00:56:12.470 --> 00:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
just overall flooding but it's it's
 
00:56:15.109 --> 00:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
never the same event and it's always
 
00:56:17.109 --> 00:56:17.119 align:start position:0%
unexpected so
 
00:56:19.349 --> 00:56:19.359 align:start position:0%
yes we need to be better prepared for
 
00:56:21.349 --> 00:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
this thank you would you be willing to
 
00:56:23.670 --> 00:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
take any questions i would be happy to
 
00:56:24.789 --> 00:56:24.799 align:start position:0%
anyone have a question for
 
00:56:28.630 --> 00:56:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:30.870 --> 00:56:30.880 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you so much for your
 
00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:33.349 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you so much for your
testimony

00:56:33.349 --> 00:56:33.359 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:56:35.349 --> 00:56:35.359 align:start position:0%
thank you next we'd like to hear from
 
00:56:48.630 --> 00:56:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:50.789 --> 00:56:50.799 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and members of the
 
00:56:53.910 --> 00:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
committee walt stapleton claremont ward
 
00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
3 sullivan county district 5.
 
00:57:00.920 --> 00:57:00.930 align:start position:0%
i was going to i am in support of 1665
 
00:57:00.930 --> 00:57:02.309 align:start position:0%
i was going to i am in support of 1665
[Music]

00:57:02.309 --> 00:57:02.319 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:57:04.549 --> 00:57:04.559 align:start position:0%
and i was going to speak more in general
 
00:57:06.950 --> 00:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
terms but i'm going to forego
 
00:57:08.789 --> 00:57:08.799 align:start position:0%
general remarks
 
00:57:11.430 --> 00:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
for the interest of time
 
00:57:14.549 --> 00:57:14.559 align:start position:0%
but it occurred to me that
 
00:57:17.190 --> 00:57:17.200 align:start position:0%
there might be a possibility instead of
 
00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:18.950 align:start position:0%
there might be a possibility instead of
0.5

00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
0.5
 
00:57:21.829 --> 00:57:21.839 align:start position:0%
maybe an indexed
 
00:57:21.839 --> 00:57:23.270 align:start position:0%
maybe an indexed
scale

00:57:23.270 --> 00:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
scale
 
00:57:25.589 --> 00:57:25.599 align:start position:0%
and i say that because in claremont we
 
00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:33.270 --> 00:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
resources like acworth or
 
00:57:36.150 --> 00:57:36.160 align:start position:0%
plainfield or other towns
 
00:57:39.109 --> 00:57:39.119 align:start position:0%
and our budget is much more than the 1
 
00:57:42.549 --> 00:57:42.559 align:start position:0%
million that was cited for acworth
 
00:57:45.349 --> 00:57:45.359 align:start position:0%
so you know when you have a budget of
 
00:57:47.910 --> 00:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
10 or 20 million dollars
 
00:57:51.109 --> 00:57:51.119 align:start position:0%
for a larger municipality
 
00:57:54.950 --> 00:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
now you're beginning to impact
 
00:57:58.230 --> 00:57:58.240 align:start position:0%
the budget for that particular item
 
00:57:58.240 --> 00:57:58.950 align:start position:0%
the budget for that particular item
and

00:57:58.950 --> 00:57:58.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:58:00.870 --> 00:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
you know like buying insurance because
 
00:58:03.109 --> 00:58:03.119 align:start position:0%
in a way it is kind of an insurance is
 
00:58:05.670 --> 00:58:05.680 align:start position:0%
an option to have help in the case of an
 
00:58:10.150 --> 00:58:10.160 align:start position:0%
emergency perhaps an indexed or scaled
 
00:58:15.270 --> 00:58:15.280 align:start position:0%
percentage relative to municipal budgets
 
00:58:17.270 --> 00:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
and and maybe even
 
00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:18.390 align:start position:0%
and and maybe even
the

00:58:18.390 --> 00:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:58:20.549 --> 00:58:20.559 align:start position:0%
geological nature of the town if you
 
00:58:23.030 --> 00:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
have no water courses except a swamp or
 
00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:24.150 align:start position:0%
have no water courses except a swamp or
two

00:58:24.150 --> 00:58:24.160 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:58:27.190 --> 00:58:27.200 align:start position:0%
your need for the disaster relief
 
00:58:29.910 --> 00:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
will be much less than several streams
 
00:58:32.710 --> 00:58:32.720 align:start position:0%
brooks and so forth running through
 
00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:34.309 align:start position:0%
brooks and so forth running through
towns

00:58:34.309 --> 00:58:34.319 align:start position:0%
towns
 
00:58:36.710 --> 00:58:36.720 align:start position:0%
so that would be my recommendation as
 
00:58:38.549 --> 00:58:38.559 align:start position:0%
long as there's going to be a
 
00:58:41.030 --> 00:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
an amendment made maybe consider that as
 
00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
an option
 
00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:44.710 align:start position:0%
an option
um

00:58:44.710 --> 00:58:44.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:47.589 --> 00:58:47.599 align:start position:0%
the impacts are going to continue
 
00:58:47.599 --> 00:58:48.390 align:start position:0%
the impacts are going to continue
for

00:58:48.390 --> 00:58:48.400 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:58:50.630 --> 00:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
flash floods and heavy rains almost
 
00:58:52.870 --> 00:58:52.880 align:start position:0%
tropical rains in claremont we had some
 
00:58:55.349 --> 00:58:55.359 align:start position:0%
war shouts we have a large enough budget
 
00:58:57.510 --> 00:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
we have a large enough
 
00:59:01.750 --> 00:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
resource of dpw to handle these things
 
00:59:04.390 --> 00:59:04.400 align:start position:0%
and the budget will handle supplement
 
00:59:05.990 --> 00:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
by contractors
 
00:59:08.230 --> 00:59:08.240 align:start position:0%
but we have noticed that there's been a
 
00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:09.829 align:start position:0%
but we have noticed that there's been a
change

00:59:09.829 --> 00:59:09.839 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:59:12.549 --> 00:59:12.559 align:start position:0%
wider culverts better ditching
 
00:59:15.190 --> 00:59:15.200 align:start position:0%
a larger rip-rap because we're going to
 
00:59:16.789 --> 00:59:16.799 align:start position:0%
have more of this
 
00:59:18.789 --> 00:59:18.799 align:start position:0%
and we believe that our surrounding
 
00:59:21.270 --> 00:59:21.280 align:start position:0%
communities the smaller towns need this
 
00:59:23.190 --> 00:59:23.200 align:start position:0%
kind of assistance
 
00:59:25.030 --> 00:59:25.040 align:start position:0%
because they don't have the wherewithal
 
00:59:26.470 --> 00:59:26.480 align:start position:0%
and the resources of the larger
 
00:59:28.789 --> 00:59:28.799 align:start position:0%
municipality so i'm going to end with
 
00:59:30.829 --> 00:59:30.839 align:start position:0%
that and ask you to support
 
00:59:33.589 --> 00:59:33.599 align:start position:0%
1665 especially if it comes forward with
 
00:59:34.789 --> 00:59:34.799 align:start position:0%
an amendment
 
00:59:36.630 --> 00:59:36.640 align:start position:0%
would you be willing to take questions

00:59:58.069 --> 00:59:58.079 align:start position:0%
testimony from uh natch grayas
 
01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:04.069 --> 01:00:04.079 align:start position:0%
thank you nate graves for the new
 
01:00:05.910 --> 01:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire municipal association we
 
01:00:08.390 --> 01:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
support this bill the way we read it is
 
01:00:10.789 --> 01:00:10.799 align:start position:0%
it's an opt-in provision i know that was
 
01:00:13.589 --> 01:00:13.599 align:start position:0%
a question that came up earlier
 
01:00:13.599 --> 01:00:14.470 align:start position:0%
a question that came up earlier
and

01:00:14.470 --> 01:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
i guess the only thing i would add
 
01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
not to be repetitive but i believe the
 
01:00:21.829 --> 01:00:21.839 align:start position:0%
committee's pretty much identified this
 
01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
is the bill as written is really
 
01:00:25.910 --> 01:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
designed for smaller municipalities to
 
01:00:31.270 --> 01:00:31.280 align:start position:0%
have access to funds when they have a
 
01:00:32.950 --> 01:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
major natural disaster go through their
 
01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:35.109 align:start position:0%
major natural disaster go through their
area

01:00:35.109 --> 01:00:35.119 align:start position:0%
area
 
01:00:37.109 --> 01:00:37.119 align:start position:0%
and as the committee identified you know
 
01:00:40.230 --> 01:00:40.240 align:start position:0%
if we adjust the
 
01:00:42.870 --> 01:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
line 25 for the total damage amount
 
01:00:44.470 --> 01:00:44.480 align:start position:0%
maybe to be something like the
 
01:00:47.430 --> 01:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
municipality's annual road budget
 
01:00:49.910 --> 01:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
or if it's some other calculation that
 
01:00:52.069 --> 01:00:52.079 align:start position:0%
may attract more municipalities to
 
01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
choose to participate in the fund
 
01:00:58.069 --> 01:00:58.079 align:start position:0%
the only other thing that i would add
 
01:01:00.230 --> 01:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
is that uh
 
01:01:02.470 --> 01:01:02.480 align:start position:0%
from our reading essentially over time
 
01:01:04.309 --> 01:01:04.319 align:start position:0%
the state would contribute 30 million
 
01:01:05.910 --> 01:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
dollars to this
 
01:01:07.510 --> 01:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
fund it would
 
01:01:09.670 --> 01:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
that's the that's the cap on the state
 
01:01:11.829 --> 01:01:11.839 align:start position:0%
funding at this point in time and then
 
01:01:13.829 --> 01:01:13.839 align:start position:0%
municipalities would
 
01:01:15.829 --> 01:01:15.839 align:start position:0%
annually contribute so
 
01:01:18.549 --> 01:01:18.559 align:start position:0%
assuming no natural disasters happen the
 
01:01:21.910 --> 01:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
fund would continue to accumulate monies
 
01:01:24.150 --> 01:01:24.160 align:start position:0%
and there's no there's no cap on that it
 
01:01:26.309 --> 01:01:26.319 align:start position:0%
would just continue to accumulate monies
 
01:01:27.829 --> 01:01:27.839 align:start position:0%
um and then as natural disasters
 
01:01:29.670 --> 01:01:29.680 align:start position:0%
occurred it would pay out
 
01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
um for that which would be the reduction
 
01:01:34.870 --> 01:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
in the fund i'm happy to take questions
 
01:01:36.870 --> 01:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
are you willing to accept questions from
 
01:01:38.789 --> 01:01:38.799 align:start position:0%
the committee yes
 
01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for the nhma yes
 
01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
representative klee
 
01:01:45.109 --> 01:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
thank you again mr chair and thank you
 
01:01:47.109 --> 01:01:47.119 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh it kind of
 
01:01:48.950 --> 01:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
relates back to what i had said before
 
01:01:50.470 --> 01:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
and i think you touched on it when you
 
01:01:52.309 --> 01:01:52.319 align:start position:0%
said that
 
01:01:55.589 --> 01:01:55.599 align:start position:0%
those those smaller towns and so on so
 
01:01:58.150 --> 01:01:58.160 align:start position:0%
would it not be better to
 
01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
look at towns that have a a budget of
 
01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:01.510 align:start position:0%
look at towns that have a a budget of
whether

01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
whether
 
01:02:03.910 --> 01:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
an annual municipal budget of
 
01:02:06.069 --> 01:02:06.079 align:start position:0%
less than x amount of millions or
 
01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
whatever it would be
 
01:02:08.630 --> 01:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
because they would be the ones that
 
01:02:11.270 --> 01:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
would be benefiting more for it than
 
01:02:14.069 --> 01:02:14.079 align:start position:0%
i can't choose among towns i represent
 
01:02:16.549 --> 01:02:16.559 align:start position:0%
all of them um so that's a policy
 
01:02:18.069 --> 01:02:18.079 align:start position:0%
decision for the committee thank you so
 
01:02:20.789 --> 01:02:20.799 align:start position:0%
much representative power thank you mr
 
01:02:22.150 --> 01:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:02:24.470 --> 01:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
question uh my question pertains to the
 
01:02:25.750 --> 01:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal note
 
01:02:28.789 --> 01:02:28.799 align:start position:0%
where it says that um
 
01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
there would be a need for a part-time
 
01:02:33.109 --> 01:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
planner with an annual salary of 30 000
 
01:02:33.119 --> 01:02:34.390 align:start position:0%
planner with an annual salary of 30 000
um

01:02:34.390 --> 01:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:37.270 --> 01:02:37.280 align:start position:0%
dollars in order to administer
 
01:02:41.029 --> 01:02:41.039 align:start position:0%
the program so my question is um
 
01:02:43.029 --> 01:02:43.039 align:start position:0%
where in this bill
 
01:02:44.710 --> 01:02:44.720 align:start position:0%
and or how
 
01:02:45.829 --> 01:02:45.839 align:start position:0%
would this
 
01:02:47.190 --> 01:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
position be
 
01:02:50.789 --> 01:02:50.799 align:start position:0%
authorized and how would it from
 
01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
what department would support
 
01:02:55.029 --> 01:02:55.039 align:start position:0%
the salary
 
01:02:56.470 --> 01:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
i i would defer to the department of
 
01:02:58.710 --> 01:02:58.720 align:start position:0%
safety for that i i don't
 
01:03:02.789 --> 01:03:02.799 align:start position:0%
i don't know what their requirements are
 
01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:06.160 align:start position:0%

any other comments yes and thank you mr
 
01:24:05.189 --> 01:24:05.199 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you representative um
 
01:24:06.470 --> 01:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
and i was
 
01:24:09.030 --> 01:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
curious rather than to
 
01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:10.550 align:start position:0%
curious rather than to
um

01:24:10.550 --> 01:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:12.629 --> 01:24:12.639 align:start position:0%
i was curious based on what we might
 
01:24:15.590 --> 01:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
receive as a motion or as an amendment
 
01:24:19.030 --> 01:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
to a further to an additional bill
 
01:24:20.870 --> 01:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
about whether or not we should act on
 
01:24:22.790 --> 01:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
this as it is because without that
 
01:24:24.709 --> 01:24:24.719 align:start position:0%
amendment i think this bill would have
 
01:24:26.390 --> 01:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
been important to move forward on or
 
01:24:27.910 --> 01:24:27.920 align:start position:0%
could have been significant to move
 
01:24:30.149 --> 01:24:30.159 align:start position:0%
forward on uh if the full committee
 
01:24:32.629 --> 01:24:32.639 align:start position:0%
feels that that is inappropriate we can
 
01:24:34.629 --> 01:24:34.639 align:start position:0%
take action and then uh additional
 
01:24:35.910 --> 01:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
action after that
 
01:24:38.629 --> 01:24:38.639 align:start position:0%
so but uh i i felt as it is and without
 
01:24:40.950 --> 01:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
any additional amendments to any other
 
01:24:43.030 --> 01:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
bills that the motion should be ought to
 
01:24:46.870 --> 01:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
pass all right let me make a suggestion
 
01:24:48.870 --> 01:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
i hear i hear what you're saying and i
 
01:24:51.430 --> 01:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
don't disagree with it i would
 
01:24:53.189 --> 01:24:53.199 align:start position:0%
suggest that we move forward with the
 
01:24:56.629 --> 01:24:56.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:00.550 --> 01:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:03.350 align:start position:0%

pass it or itl it
 
01:25:07.189 --> 01:25:07.199 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:25:11.270 --> 01:25:11.280 align:start position:0%
when we consider 1397 based on how that
 
01:25:13.430 --> 01:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
vote turns out we can come back and we
 
01:25:15.270 --> 01:25:15.280 align:start position:0%
can reconsider
 
01:25:21.189 --> 01:25:21.199 align:start position:0%

just procedurally then um
 
01:29:56.070 --> 01:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
we didn't i uh we put the first bill on
 
01:29:57.750 --> 01:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
the consent calendar this bill as it
 
01:29:59.510 --> 01:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
stands right now
 
01:30:01.430 --> 01:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
would probably need a committee report
 
01:30:03.110 --> 01:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
is it fair to say we should wait until
 
01:30:06.550 --> 01:30:06.560 align:start position:0%
we do 1397 before we assign a committee
 
01:30:08.629 --> 01:30:08.639 align:start position:0%
port a committee report in favor or
 
01:30:08.639 --> 01:30:09.830 align:start position:0%
port a committee report in favor or

01:30:13.430 --> 01:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
i think we should have signed a

01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:18.790 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:30:18.790 --> 01:30:18.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:30:20.790 --> 01:30:20.800 align:start position:0%
the motion was
 
01:30:23.510 --> 01:30:23.520 align:start position:0%

01:33:17.510 --> 01:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
so it would be a
 
01:33:22.390 --> 01:33:22.400 align:start position:0%
a major burden for a small municipality
 
01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:23.189 align:start position:0%
a major burden for a small municipality
to

01:33:23.189 --> 01:33:23.199 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:33:24.790 --> 01:33:24.800 align:start position:0%
accomplish this
 
01:33:27.750 --> 01:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
so from my standpoint that really struck
 
01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:28.550 align:start position:0%
so from my standpoint that really struck
me

01:33:28.550 --> 01:33:28.560 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:30.310 align:start position:0%
me
and

01:33:30.310 --> 01:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:33:33.189 --> 01:33:33.199 align:start position:0%
i agree with the itl motion
 
01:33:34.830 --> 01:33:34.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:33:37.510 --> 01:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
representative uh gilman
 
01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:38.629 align:start position:0%
representative uh gilman
uh

01:33:38.629 --> 01:33:38.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:33:41.590 --> 01:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
we uh we moved pretty quickly
 
01:33:43.030 --> 01:33:43.040 align:start position:0%
through this uh
 
01:33:46.229 --> 01:33:46.239 align:start position:0%
this motion and i i understand
 
01:33:47.910 --> 01:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
that you had a different motion that you
 
01:33:49.110 --> 01:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
were going to make
 
01:33:50.629 --> 01:33:50.639 align:start position:0%
if you had the opportunity out of
 
01:33:52.390 --> 01:33:52.400 align:start position:0%
courtesy to you i'd i'll give you some
 
01:33:54.550 --> 01:33:54.560 align:start position:0%
time to explain what your motion would
 
01:33:56.149 --> 01:33:56.159 align:start position:0%
have been and how how you would have
 
01:33:58.070 --> 01:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
liked to see the committee vote thank
 
01:34:00.149 --> 01:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
you mr chair it's
 
01:34:03.189 --> 01:34:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:05.110 --> 01:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
my my motion would have been ought to
 
01:34:06.950 --> 01:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
pass uh
 
01:34:09.510 --> 01:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
and as i said in testimony this is
 
01:34:11.990 --> 01:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
really a house cleaning bill
 
01:34:13.910 --> 01:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
um right now under
 
01:34:16.229 --> 01:34:16.239 align:start position:0%
counties and
 
01:34:21.990 --> 01:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:23.830 --> 01:34:23.840 align:start position:0%
competitive bidding
 
01:34:26.390 --> 01:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
uh there are two separate
 
01:34:29.270 --> 01:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh rsas for hillsboro i think or
 
01:34:32.310 --> 01:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
merrimack and rockingham county this
 
01:34:35.030 --> 01:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
language is taken directly from one of
 
01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:36.070 align:start position:0%
language is taken directly from one of
those

01:34:36.070 --> 01:34:36.080 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:34:38.790 --> 01:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
one of those sub sections
 
01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:39.990 align:start position:0%
one of those sub sections
and

01:34:39.990 --> 01:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:34:41.750 --> 01:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
so why do we have two subjects
 
01:34:44.149 --> 01:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
subsections that say the exact same
 
01:34:44.159 --> 01:34:45.510 align:start position:0%
subsections that say the exact same
thing

01:34:45.510 --> 01:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:34:47.189 --> 01:34:47.199 align:start position:0%
and white and
 
01:34:49.750 --> 01:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
and then rockingham has the exact same
 
01:34:49.760 --> 01:34:51.189 align:start position:0%
and then rockingham has the exact same
amount

01:34:51.189 --> 01:34:51.199 align:start position:0%
amount
 
01:34:53.189 --> 01:34:53.199 align:start position:0%
i don't i think that
 
01:34:56.470 --> 01:34:56.480 align:start position:0%
with competitive bidding
 
01:34:58.550 --> 01:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
it can be done
 
01:35:01.750 --> 01:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
even in small towns because there are
 
01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:04.149 align:start position:0%
even in small towns because there are
uh

01:35:04.149 --> 01:35:04.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:07.109 --> 01:35:07.119 align:start position:0%
forms you can you know take off from any
 
01:35:09.189 --> 01:35:09.199 align:start position:0%
other town such as the ones that have
 
01:35:10.550 --> 01:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
this already
 
01:35:13.830 --> 01:35:13.840 align:start position:0%
um and it's um
 
01:35:15.910 --> 01:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
do we have to make these carveds for
 
01:35:19.510 --> 01:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:21.590 --> 01:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
when they when there's opportunities of
 
01:35:23.910 --> 01:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
advertising that are free
 
01:35:27.109 --> 01:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
nhma does it other
 
01:35:30.229 --> 01:35:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:32.149 --> 01:35:32.159 align:start position:0%
and then there are even larger ones i
 
01:35:34.070 --> 01:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
don't see
 
01:35:35.669 --> 01:35:35.679 align:start position:0%
i don't see the problem with the number
 
01:35:39.669 --> 01:35:39.679 align:start position:0%
of personnel it takes to write an rfp
 
01:35:42.709 --> 01:35:42.719 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:35:45.030 --> 01:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
01:35:48.070 --> 01:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr chair yeah i i support
 
01:35:50.629 --> 01:35:50.639 align:start position:0%
this bill and i'm against the itl
 
01:35:51.990 --> 01:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
for the reasons that representative
 
01:35:54.149 --> 01:35:54.159 align:start position:0%
gilman stated but also it gives
 
01:35:57.189 --> 01:35:57.199 align:start position:0%
taxpayers the confidence of knowing that
 
01:35:59.109 --> 01:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
purchases above five thousand dollars
 
01:36:01.030 --> 01:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
are going to be handled consistently and
 
01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:02.550 align:start position:0%
are going to be handled consistently and
responsibly

01:36:02.550 --> 01:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
responsibly
 
01:36:04.790 --> 01:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
um to to representative lasalle's point
 
01:36:04.800 --> 01:36:05.590 align:start position:0%
um to to representative lasalle's point
i

01:36:05.590 --> 01:36:05.600 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:36:07.830 --> 01:36:07.840 align:start position:0%
i read this it applies to counties not
 
01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:08.830 align:start position:0%
i read this it applies to counties not
small

01:36:08.830 --> 01:36:08.840 align:start position:0%
small
 
01:36:12.149 --> 01:36:12.159 align:start position:0%
towns so thank you
 
01:36:15.189 --> 01:36:15.199 align:start position:0%
yes representative thank you mr chair um
 
01:36:17.590 --> 01:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
my my thought on this similar to what i
 
01:36:19.510 --> 01:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
have heard here but then to the comment
 
01:36:21.830 --> 01:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
about what problem is it is it aiming to
 
01:36:24.629 --> 01:36:24.639 align:start position:0%
fix and what we saw is the piecemeal
 
01:36:25.990 --> 01:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
approach to
 
01:36:28.390 --> 01:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
different uh different counties in the
 
01:36:28.400 --> 01:36:29.189 align:start position:0%
different uh different counties in the
state

01:36:29.189 --> 01:36:29.199 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:36:31.510 --> 01:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
and my hope with this bill and why i
 
01:36:33.510 --> 01:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
would support it would be to get to some
 
01:36:36.629 --> 01:36:36.639 align:start position:0%
consistency treat like things alike even
 
01:36:38.229 --> 01:36:38.239 align:start position:0%
though i respect the fact that each of
 
01:36:40.470 --> 01:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
the counties is different but a process
 
01:36:43.350 --> 01:36:43.360 align:start position:0%
should be consistent um so that there is
 
01:36:46.229 --> 01:36:46.239 align:start position:0%
some expectation uh going in that you
 
01:36:47.990 --> 01:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
have that consistency and you don't have
 
01:36:49.270 --> 01:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
to look in different places for
 
01:36:51.750 --> 01:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
different rules so i would uh so i'm
 
01:36:53.990 --> 01:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
opposed to the itl and would support a
 
01:36:55.430 --> 01:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
different motion should we get there
 
01:36:58.629 --> 01:36:58.639 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
01:37:00.390 --> 01:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
any other comments yes representative
 
01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:01.669 align:start position:0%
any other comments yes representative

01:37:01.669 --> 01:37:01.679 align:start position:0%
gallagher
 
01:37:02.870 --> 01:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
yes i
 
01:37:06.149 --> 01:37:06.159 align:start position:0%
oppose the motion to itl because i
 
01:37:06.159 --> 01:37:07.910 align:start position:0%
oppose the motion to itl because i
remember

01:37:07.910 --> 01:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
remember
 
01:37:07.920 --> 01:37:09.669 align:start position:0%

itlling

01:37:09.669 --> 01:37:09.679 align:start position:0%
itlling
 
01:37:12.390 --> 01:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
a similar bill
 
01:37:14.390 --> 01:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
last year that would have been just for
 
01:37:16.629 --> 01:37:16.639 align:start position:0%
carroll county and we i believe we did
 
01:37:18.229 --> 01:37:18.239 align:start position:0%
so on the grounds that we thought it
 
01:37:19.590 --> 01:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
ought to be for
 
01:37:21.590 --> 01:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
all counties so
 
01:37:24.950 --> 01:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
now that we have a bill to do so for all
 
01:37:27.350 --> 01:37:27.360 align:start position:0%
counties we ought to remain consistent
 
01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:28.390 align:start position:0%
counties we ought to remain consistent
with

01:37:28.390 --> 01:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:37:30.390 --> 01:37:30.400 align:start position:0%
our previous reasoning
 
01:37:33.030 --> 01:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
and use that here to
 
01:37:36.629 --> 01:37:36.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:37.510 --> 01:37:37.520 align:start position:0%

you're going to write the

yes i will uh i also have a observation
 
01:39:16.070 --> 01:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
to share
 
01:39:18.390 --> 01:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
it appears that if too many of the

microphones are on
 
01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:20.709 align:start position:0%
microphones are on
then

01:39:20.709 --> 01:39:20.719 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:39:20.719 --> 01:39:21.910 align:start position:0%

i represent the town of litchfield

i represent the town of litchfield
and

01:41:05.430 --> 01:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:41:07.109 --> 01:41:07.119 align:start position:0%
this would be
 
01:41:09.669 --> 01:41:09.679 align:start position:0%
detrimental if i was to
 
01:41:09.679 --> 01:41:10.709 align:start position:0%
detrimental if i was to
to

01:41:10.709 --> 01:41:10.719 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:41:13.270 --> 01:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
vote otp on this
 
01:41:15.750 --> 01:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
i would not be representing my

i would not be representing my
constituents

01:41:17.109 --> 01:41:17.119 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
01:41:21.030 --> 01:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:22.550 --> 01:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
hi um
 
01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:24.070 align:start position:0%
hi um
i

01:41:24.070 --> 01:41:24.080 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:41:26.229 --> 01:41:26.239 align:start position:0%
i support this bill and thus oppose the
 
01:41:30.550 --> 01:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
motion to itl it because i think
 
01:41:32.950 --> 01:41:32.960 align:start position:0%
that representation should be
 
01:41:36.550 --> 01:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
based on population that more people
 
01:41:38.870 --> 01:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
should mean more representation
 
01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:39.830 align:start position:0%
should mean more representation
so

01:41:39.830 --> 01:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:41:41.750 --> 01:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
thus i
 
01:41:43.910 --> 01:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh support i support this bill and
 
01:41:46.790 --> 01:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
oppose the motion to yell it okay thank
 
01:41:49.030 --> 01:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
you yes representative
 
01:41:51.669 --> 01:41:51.679 align:start position:0%
i support the itl for the same reasons
 
01:41:54.229 --> 01:41:54.239 align:start position:0%
representative lasalles does
 
01:41:56.870 --> 01:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
it dilutes the vote of communities such
 
01:41:58.790 --> 01:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
as merrimack and the national regional
 
01:42:00.550 --> 01:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
planning commission
 
01:42:03.109 --> 01:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
also as i stated during or asked during
 
01:42:05.030 --> 01:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
the public hearing i'm not convinced
 
01:42:05.040 --> 01:42:06.070 align:start position:0%
the public hearing i'm not convinced
that

01:42:06.070 --> 01:42:06.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:42:08.870 --> 01:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
decisions made by larger cities
 
01:42:11.189 --> 01:42:11.199 align:start position:0%
won't have an effect on smaller towns
 
01:42:13.270 --> 01:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
and i think they need to have a stronger
 
01:42:16.149 --> 01:42:16.159 align:start position:0%
voice in making those decisions
 
01:42:18.950 --> 01:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:20.950 --> 01:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
01:42:23.430 --> 01:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i also support the
 
01:42:23.440 --> 01:42:24.550 align:start position:0%

01:42:24.550 --> 01:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
motion
 
01:42:27.189 --> 01:42:27.199 align:start position:0%
and expedient to legislate
 
01:42:29.189 --> 01:42:29.199 align:start position:0%
simply due to the fact that this bill as
 
01:42:32.470 --> 01:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
written increases the influence of large
 
01:42:35.189 --> 01:42:35.199 align:start position:0%
towns and municipalities at the expense
 
01:42:38.229 --> 01:42:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:40.229 --> 01:42:40.239 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
01:42:42.950 --> 01:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
yeah i support that emotion to itl for
 
01:42:44.390 --> 01:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
the some reason
 
01:42:47.189 --> 01:42:47.199 align:start position:0%
um i represent a small town and i
 
01:42:51.270 --> 01:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
believe um i if i support this bill i
 
01:42:54.310 --> 01:42:54.320 align:start position:0%
going against my constituents
 
01:42:56.790 --> 01:42:56.800 align:start position:0%

though i'm from a large municipality um
 
01:43:07.590 --> 01:43:07.600 align:start position:0%
and that was based on speaking with um
 
01:43:09.830 --> 01:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
our city planner and so on and he felt
 
01:43:09.840 --> 01:43:10.629 align:start position:0%
our city planner and so on and he felt
that

01:43:10.629 --> 01:43:10.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:43:12.550 --> 01:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
our particular
 
01:43:14.870 --> 01:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
district and so on was represented well
 
01:43:16.870 --> 01:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
enough and that it would just add too
 
01:43:20.229 --> 01:43:20.239 align:start position:0%
many more people to it so thank you
 
01:43:21.910 --> 01:43:21.920 align:start position:0%

mr chairman yes

01:46:21.109 --> 01:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:46:24.870 --> 01:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
to me the the sponsor of the bill
 
01:46:24.880 --> 01:46:26.390 align:start position:0%
to me the the sponsor of the bill
made

01:46:26.390 --> 01:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
made
 
01:46:30.669 --> 01:46:30.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:30.679 --> 01:46:32.629 align:start position:0%
 
enthusiastic

01:46:32.629 --> 01:46:32.639 align:start position:0%
enthusiastic
 
01:46:36.229 --> 01:46:36.239 align:start position:0%
and i applaud the
 
01:46:38.310 --> 01:46:38.320 align:start position:0%
the idea
 
01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:39.350 align:start position:0%
the idea
of

01:46:39.350 --> 01:46:39.360 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:46:42.310 --> 01:46:42.320 align:start position:0%
improving home ownership particularly
 
01:46:44.550 --> 01:46:44.560 align:start position:0%
for people who
 
01:46:47.030 --> 01:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
have trouble affording it
 
01:46:50.470 --> 01:46:50.480 align:start position:0%
the problem with the bill as i see it
 
01:46:53.590 --> 01:46:53.600 align:start position:0%
is a homestead exemption
 
01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:55.109 align:start position:0%
is a homestead exemption
is

01:46:55.109 --> 01:46:55.119 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:46:58.629 --> 01:46:58.639 align:start position:0%
it's very complicated and convoluted the
 
01:47:01.270 --> 01:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
way it's written in my opinion
 
01:47:04.310 --> 01:47:04.320 align:start position:0%
and secondly anytime you give people an
 
01:47:04.320 --> 01:47:05.590 align:start position:0%
and secondly anytime you give people an
exemption

01:47:05.590 --> 01:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
01:47:09.830 --> 01:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:11.830 --> 01:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
how well-meaning
 
01:47:13.430 --> 01:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
the effort is
 
01:47:16.310 --> 01:47:16.320 align:start position:0%
someone has to pay the bill for that
 
01:47:19.669 --> 01:47:19.679 align:start position:0%
and i think that a homestead exemption
 
01:47:19.679 --> 01:47:21.030 align:start position:0%
and i think that a homestead exemption
would

01:47:21.030 --> 01:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:47:22.470 --> 01:47:22.480 align:start position:0%
put up a
 
01:47:24.470 --> 01:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
significant burden
 
01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:26.229 align:start position:0%
significant burden
on

01:47:26.229 --> 01:47:26.239 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:47:28.709 --> 01:47:28.719 align:start position:0%
people who did not get the homestead
 
01:47:28.719 --> 01:47:31.590 align:start position:0%
people who did not get the homestead
exemption

01:47:31.590 --> 01:47:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:33.270 --> 01:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
thank you those of you
 
01:47:34.950 --> 01:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
not engaging the committee right now if
 
01:47:36.390 --> 01:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
you turn your microphones off i
 
01:47:38.950 --> 01:47:38.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
 
01:47:41.510 --> 01:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
yes representatively
 
01:47:43.510 --> 01:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
01:47:44.950 --> 01:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
i agree
 
01:47:46.950 --> 01:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
with my colleague representative los
 
01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:48.310 align:start position:0%
with my colleague representative los
alas

01:47:48.310 --> 01:47:48.320 align:start position:0%
alas
 
01:47:50.629 --> 01:47:50.639 align:start position:0%
i i went i went through and i know this
 
01:47:52.550 --> 01:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
is a um
 
01:47:54.390 --> 01:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
an enabling bill which means that it's
 
01:47:56.070 --> 01:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
not going to force anybody to do it but
 
01:47:58.149 --> 01:47:58.159 align:start position:0%
i think adding one more type of
 
01:47:59.590 --> 01:47:59.600 align:start position:0%
exemption and so on it's just going to
 
01:48:01.030 --> 01:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
muddy the waters
 
01:48:02.709 --> 01:48:02.719 align:start position:0%
i i literally went through all of the
 
01:48:05.590 --> 01:48:05.600 align:start position:0%
ones at dra and we have so many of the
 
01:48:08.149 --> 01:48:08.159 align:start position:0%
exemptions i think this is not a bad
 
01:48:08.159 --> 01:48:09.109 align:start position:0%
exemptions i think this is not a bad
idea

01:48:09.109 --> 01:48:09.119 align:start position:0%
idea
 
01:48:11.669 --> 01:48:11.679 align:start position:0%
i just think we it would be better to do
 
01:48:13.270 --> 01:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
a whole housekeeping and i know some
 
01:48:15.430 --> 01:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
people will tell me baby steps baby
 
01:48:16.550 --> 01:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
steps but
 
01:48:19.270 --> 01:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
i i look at all the exemptions and this
 
01:48:21.189 --> 01:48:21.199 align:start position:0%
could actually add to some of the ones
 
01:48:23.750 --> 01:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
that nashua had if in fact we did um
 
01:48:26.229 --> 01:48:26.239 align:start position:0%
enable it um and i i just think it it
 
01:48:28.790 --> 01:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
just kind of muddies the waters but um
 
01:48:31.270 --> 01:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
i do i do see it as not a bad
 
01:48:33.350 --> 01:48:33.360 align:start position:0%
bill just not on top of all the ones we
 
01:48:35.189 --> 01:48:35.199 align:start position:0%
have so thank you representative yes
 
01:48:35.199 --> 01:48:37.350 align:start position:0%
have so thank you representative yes
representative

01:48:37.350 --> 01:48:37.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:48:39.669 --> 01:48:39.679 align:start position:0%
uh one of the qualifying factors in in
 
01:48:41.830 --> 01:48:41.840 align:start position:0%
this bill for getting the exemption is
 
01:48:43.109 --> 01:48:43.119 align:start position:0%
that your
 
01:48:44.870 --> 01:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
your household
 
01:48:48.950 --> 01:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:51.350 --> 01:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
income in the municipality
 
01:48:51.360 --> 01:48:53.350 align:start position:0%
income in the municipality
and

01:48:53.350 --> 01:48:53.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:48:56.550 --> 01:48:56.560 align:start position:0%
i asked how you would determine this
 
01:48:58.790 --> 01:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
what the median
 
01:49:01.590 --> 01:49:01.600 align:start position:0%
household income was and uh the response
 
01:49:03.430 --> 01:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
was that uh well you just do a google
 
01:49:05.590 --> 01:49:05.600 align:start position:0%
search and uh
 
01:49:05.600 --> 01:49:06.950 align:start position:0%
search and uh
i

01:49:06.950 --> 01:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:49:09.189 --> 01:49:09.199 align:start position:0%
i think that's a
 
01:49:11.030 --> 01:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
innovative idea
 
01:49:13.430 --> 01:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
but uh i don't believe that
 
01:49:15.990 --> 01:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
something is subjective as that should
 
01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:17.109 align:start position:0%
something is subjective as that should
be

01:49:17.109 --> 01:49:17.119 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:49:17.119 --> 01:49:18.229 align:start position:0%
be
determined

01:49:18.229 --> 01:49:18.239 align:start position:0%
determined
 
01:49:20.629 --> 01:49:20.639 align:start position:0%
be used to determine who is and who
 
01:49:20.639 --> 01:49:21.669 align:start position:0%
be used to determine who is and who
isn't

01:49:21.669 --> 01:49:21.679 align:start position:0%
isn't
 
01:49:24.390 --> 01:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
qualified for this exemption this is why
 
01:49:26.790 --> 01:49:26.800 align:start position:0%
i support itl
 
01:49:30.310 --> 01:49:30.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative gilman
 
01:49:33.430 --> 01:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i also support the
 
01:49:33.440 --> 01:49:34.790 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i also support the
itl

01:49:34.790 --> 01:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
itl
 
01:49:36.870 --> 01:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
motion um because
 
01:49:38.229 --> 01:49:38.239 align:start position:0%
basically because of the reasons that
 
01:49:41.030 --> 01:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
have already been spoken but um i don't
 
01:49:43.189 --> 01:49:43.199 align:start position:0%
think it will have the uh
 
01:49:45.910 --> 01:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
result that the sponsor was looking for
 
01:49:45.920 --> 01:49:49.510 align:start position:0%
result that the sponsor was looking for
um

01:49:49.510 --> 01:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:51.189 --> 01:49:51.199 align:start position:0%
as i read it
 
01:49:51.199 --> 01:49:53.669 align:start position:0%
as i read it
anybody

01:49:53.669 --> 01:49:53.679 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
01:49:56.470 --> 01:49:56.480 align:start position:0%
can work for this
 
01:49:59.510 --> 01:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
exemption no matter what age they are
 
01:50:01.830 --> 01:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
and we're having a problem i understand
 
01:50:05.990 --> 01:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:07.990 --> 01:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
being welcoming to people of a younger
 
01:50:10.470 --> 01:50:10.480 align:start position:0%
age but but this makes it welcoming to
 
01:50:13.669 --> 01:50:13.679 align:start position:0%
people an older age and her goal was to
 
01:50:13.679 --> 01:50:14.550 align:start position:0%
people an older age and her goal was to
get

01:50:14.550 --> 01:50:14.560 align:start position:0%
get
 
01:50:16.390 --> 01:50:16.400 align:start position:0%
you know affordable housing for people
 
01:50:18.950 --> 01:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
of a younger age and i don't think that
 
01:50:21.430 --> 01:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
happens in this bill
 
01:50:23.830 --> 01:50:23.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair okay thank you
 
01:50:27.270 --> 01:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
representative ivy band
 
01:50:30.070 --> 01:50:30.080 align:start position:0%
now everyone calls me ivy uh i actually
 
01:50:32.709 --> 01:50:32.719 align:start position:0%
am going to oppose the itl bill for two
 
01:50:35.189 --> 01:50:35.199 align:start position:0%
reasons one of which is
 
01:50:37.510 --> 01:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
i do think that
 
01:50:39.910 --> 01:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
since this is an enabling legislation
 
01:50:42.470 --> 01:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
any town that or city who chose to use
 
01:50:44.870 --> 01:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
it would have to look at all of their
 
01:50:47.270 --> 01:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
existing exemptions and see which ones
 
01:50:48.950 --> 01:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
they want to retain
 
01:50:51.350 --> 01:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
in addition to the homestead bill the
 
01:50:54.520 --> 01:50:54.530 align:start position:0%
second reason is that this
 
01:50:54.530 --> 01:50:56.470 align:start position:0%
second reason is that this
[Music]

01:50:56.470 --> 01:50:56.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:50:58.950 --> 01:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
a homestead exemption privileges people
 
01:51:01.350 --> 01:51:01.360 align:start position:0%
who live and work in a community
 
01:51:04.709 --> 01:51:04.719 align:start position:0%
because it has to be your primary place
 
01:51:07.109 --> 01:51:07.119 align:start position:0%
and i think those are exactly the people
 
01:51:09.589 --> 01:51:09.599 align:start position:0%
that we want to retain in the state of
 
01:51:12.470 --> 01:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and there's no question
 
01:51:15.990 --> 01:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
that our existing property tax system
 
01:51:18.709 --> 01:51:18.719 align:start position:0%
makes it very difficult for people to
 
01:51:21.350 --> 01:51:21.360 align:start position:0%
become homeowners and while i do not
 
01:51:23.510 --> 01:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
believe that becoming a homeowner
 
01:51:25.830 --> 01:51:25.840 align:start position:0%
automatically makes you a better person
 
01:51:28.070 --> 01:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
i think renters are people too
 
01:51:30.950 --> 01:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
renters also pay
 
01:51:30.960 --> 01:51:32.070 align:start position:0%
renters also pay
and

01:51:32.070 --> 01:51:32.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:51:35.589 --> 01:51:35.599 align:start position:0%
i think that it's time to take a hard
 
01:51:37.990 --> 01:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
look at the way we raise taxes in new
 
01:51:39.589 --> 01:51:39.599 align:start position:0%
hampshire and i think this is
 
01:51:41.990 --> 01:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
a great step forward and particularly
 
01:51:43.510 --> 01:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
since it is
 
01:51:45.990 --> 01:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation so i'm going to
 
01:51:49.350 --> 01:51:49.360 align:start position:0%
oppose the motion of itl thank you thank
 
01:51:51.109 --> 01:51:51.119 align:start position:0%
you any other
 
01:51:51.119 --> 01:51:53.430 align:start position:0%
you any other
representative

01:51:53.430 --> 01:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:51:55.589 --> 01:51:55.599 align:start position:0%
hi um yeah i agree with the
 
01:51:58.470 --> 01:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
representative fan um i support this
 
01:52:00.070 --> 01:52:00.080 align:start position:0%
bill and
 
01:52:02.550 --> 01:52:02.560 align:start position:0%
post the motion to itl on the simple
 
01:52:05.030 --> 01:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
grounds that it makes our tax structure
 
01:52:07.830 --> 01:52:07.840 align:start position:0%
more progressively structured i believe
 
01:52:07.840 --> 01:52:09.350 align:start position:0%
more progressively structured i believe
that

01:52:09.350 --> 01:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:52:11.589 --> 01:52:11.599 align:start position:0%
people with less ability to pay should
 
01:52:13.510 --> 01:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
pay less in taxes and people with more
 
01:52:15.830 --> 01:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
ability to pay and pay more in taxes and
 
01:52:17.510 --> 01:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
it seems like
 
01:52:18.950 --> 01:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:52:18.960 --> 01:52:20.149 align:start position:0%
this bill
uh

01:52:20.149 --> 01:52:20.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:52:22.390 --> 01:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
fits with that principle so i'm going to
 
01:52:24.870 --> 01:52:24.880 align:start position:0%
support it and oppose the motion to ito
 
01:52:25.830 --> 01:52:25.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:52:25.840 --> 01:52:27.270 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

01:52:27.270 --> 01:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:52:29.430 --> 01:52:29.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
01:52:30.950 --> 01:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
i i
 
01:52:33.030 --> 01:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
think i heard it said initially that if
 
01:52:34.790 --> 01:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
the intent is very good and i agree with
 
01:52:36.550 --> 01:52:36.560 align:start position:0%
that completely and i agree with what i
 
01:52:37.830 --> 01:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
just heard from representative van
 
01:52:39.270 --> 01:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
representative gallagher about the
 
01:52:41.589 --> 01:52:41.599 align:start position:0%
intent the problem way to fix the
 
01:52:44.550 --> 01:52:44.560 align:start position:0%
problem i just don't see all of the
 
01:52:47.270 --> 01:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
solutions contained in this bill
 
01:52:50.470 --> 01:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
um that would enable a community to be
 
01:52:52.310 --> 01:52:52.320 align:start position:0%
able to be confident that they were
 
01:52:52.320 --> 01:52:53.189 align:start position:0%
able to be confident that they were
doing

01:52:53.189 --> 01:52:53.199 align:start position:0%
doing
 
01:52:55.270 --> 01:52:55.280 align:start position:0%
uh they were crossing all the eyes
 
01:52:56.950 --> 01:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
crossing all the t's and dotting all the
 
01:52:59.350 --> 01:52:59.360 align:start position:0%
i's so i'm not opposed to the intent of
 
01:53:00.629 --> 01:53:00.639 align:start position:0%
what they were trying to do i just don't
 
01:53:02.149 --> 01:53:02.159 align:start position:0%
think this bill
 
01:53:04.790 --> 01:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
gets there so there i just can't i just
 
01:53:06.870 --> 01:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
can't see how we could pass this one as
 
01:53:09.189 --> 01:53:09.199 align:start position:0%
it is thank you thank you any further
 
01:53:09.199 --> 01:53:11.510 align:start position:0%
it is thank you thank you any further
comments

01:53:11.510 --> 01:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
comments
 
01:53:13.669 --> 01:53:13.679 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
01:53:15.910 --> 01:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i also support the
 
01:53:19.350 --> 01:53:19.360 align:start position:0%
itl uh for a couple reasons one and
 
01:53:20.629 --> 01:53:20.639 align:start position:0%
although i
 
01:53:23.430 --> 01:53:23.440 align:start position:0%
typically support enabling legislations
 
01:53:25.270 --> 01:53:25.280 align:start position:0%
i think people in the community are the
 
01:53:27.510 --> 01:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
best judge of what's best for them
 
01:53:28.550 --> 01:53:28.560 align:start position:0%
but this
 
01:53:30.470 --> 01:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
a decision made by one community can
 
01:53:32.629 --> 01:53:32.639 align:start position:0%
have impact on neighboring communities
 
01:53:35.030 --> 01:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
that may have not adopted it
 
01:53:37.189 --> 01:53:37.199 align:start position:0%
i'd also like to see more study as to
 
01:53:40.149 --> 01:53:40.159 align:start position:0%
the impact on business decisions where
 
01:53:42.709 --> 01:53:42.719 align:start position:0%
business would relocate
 
01:53:44.390 --> 01:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
something like this i think really needs
 
01:53:47.270 --> 01:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
to be studied at a greater depth and
 
01:53:48.790 --> 01:53:48.800 align:start position:0%
you know perhaps looked at what would
 
01:53:51.510 --> 01:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
happen on a statewide level rather than
 
01:53:55.030 --> 01:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
municipality by municipality thank you
 
01:53:58.550 --> 01:53:58.560 align:start position:0%
thank you i too uh
 
01:53:59.990 --> 01:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
liked the idea
 
01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:01.510 align:start position:0%
liked the idea
however

01:54:01.510 --> 01:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:54:02.950 --> 01:54:02.960 align:start position:0%
as i
 
01:54:04.790 --> 01:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
went through the bill and heard the
 
01:54:07.910 --> 01:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
presentation from the sponsor
 
01:54:10.229 --> 01:54:10.239 align:start position:0%
i i cannot overcome
 
01:54:12.149 --> 01:54:12.159 align:start position:0%
what i believe the
 
01:54:13.910 --> 01:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
deficiencies in the bill
 
01:54:15.350 --> 01:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
and therefore
 
01:54:18.950 --> 01:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
i'm going to support the itl
 
01:54:18.960 --> 01:54:20.070 align:start position:0%

spoke of
 
02:13:24.629 --> 02:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
changing the length of term for county
 
02:13:27.270 --> 02:13:27.280 align:start position:0%
officers specifically county attorney
 
02:13:29.910 --> 02:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
county treasurer county sheriff county
 
02:13:31.750 --> 02:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
register of deeds
 
02:13:34.870 --> 02:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
from a two-year term to a four-year term
 
02:13:38.870 --> 02:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
that would apply to rockingham county
 
02:13:40.790 --> 02:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
during discussion during the public
 
02:13:40.800 --> 02:13:42.950 align:start position:0%
during discussion during the public
hearing

02:13:42.950 --> 02:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
02:13:45.430 --> 02:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
uh there was the the subject brought up
 
02:13:47.510 --> 02:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
about extending this to all counties
 
02:13:49.830 --> 02:13:49.840 align:start position:0%
like i know rockingham county is special
 
02:13:49.840 --> 02:13:50.550 align:start position:0%
like i know rockingham county is special
but

02:13:50.550 --> 02:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:13:52.550 --> 02:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
is it so special that those county
 
02:13:54.629 --> 02:13:54.639 align:start position:0%
officers need four-year terms when other
 
02:13:59.189 --> 02:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
counties don't so um this this amendment
 
02:14:02.310 --> 02:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
extends that and changes language in uh
 
02:14:05.750 --> 02:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
relevant sections of the rsas to reflect
 
02:14:09.830 --> 02:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
a four-year term for for those
 
02:14:09.840 --> 02:14:11.030 align:start position:0%
a four-year term for for those
four

02:14:11.030 --> 02:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
four
 
02:14:27.510 --> 02:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:29.430 --> 02:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman being from
 
02:14:31.030 --> 02:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
hillsborough county
 
02:14:33.430 --> 02:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
all i can think of is last term we had
 
02:14:35.430 --> 02:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
the most incompetent
 
02:14:36.870 --> 02:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
county attorney
 
02:14:39.189 --> 02:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
and we were so glad that it was only a
 
02:14:48.629 --> 02:14:48.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:49.910 --> 02:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
mr chair just going back to the
 
02:14:51.830 --> 02:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
testimony that we heard i
 
02:14:53.510 --> 02:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
certainly appreciate that you may not
 
02:14:55.750 --> 02:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
always get the the best person in that
 
02:14:58.629 --> 02:14:58.639 align:start position:0%
position but not speaking specifically
 
02:15:01.109 --> 02:15:01.119 align:start position:0%
to that point but the point that what
 
02:15:04.069 --> 02:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
their case load and workload is going to
 
02:15:06.830 --> 02:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
be and the fact that many of those
 
02:15:10.229 --> 02:15:10.239 align:start position:0%
cases issues take more than two years to
 
02:15:12.629 --> 02:15:12.639 align:start position:0%
resolve that was the point that they
 
02:15:15.109 --> 02:15:15.119 align:start position:0%
captured me is that they they need more
 
02:15:17.589 --> 02:15:17.599 align:start position:0%
than two years in order to see
 
02:15:20.629 --> 02:15:20.639 align:start position:0%
to the end a certain issue
 
02:15:22.950 --> 02:15:22.960 align:start position:0%
and that's the reason why i i support
 
02:15:24.790 --> 02:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
this but i i do respect that you could
 
02:15:26.390 --> 02:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
have somebody in there
 
02:15:28.470 --> 02:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
who you know that that's the that's the
 
02:15:30.629 --> 02:15:30.639 align:start position:0%
problem with elections sometimes as we
 
02:15:32.709 --> 02:15:32.719 align:start position:0%
don't always get you know
 
02:15:34.310 --> 02:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
exactly so thank you no i'm not looking
 
02:15:39.669 --> 02:15:39.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:42.310 --> 02:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
i think also the the testimony that
 
02:15:43.750 --> 02:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
struck me
 
02:15:45.830 --> 02:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
was the sheriff
 
02:15:45.840 --> 02:15:46.709 align:start position:0%
was the sheriff
who

02:15:46.709 --> 02:15:46.719 align:start position:0%
who
 
02:15:48.470 --> 02:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
was a two-year term
 
02:15:50.870 --> 02:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
and he would he would
 
02:15:53.270 --> 02:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
be standing at the pole and if he was
 
02:15:55.830 --> 02:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
elected then he had to go right out and
 
02:15:57.830 --> 02:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
start campaigning for the next two-year
 
02:16:01.189 --> 02:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
term so to me the four-year term
 
02:16:11.990 --> 02:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:12.870 --> 02:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:16:16.790 --> 02:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:18.390 --> 02:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
i think what we're doing here is
 
02:16:18.400 --> 02:16:20.149 align:start position:0%
i think what we're doing here is
targeting

02:16:20.149 --> 02:16:20.159 align:start position:0%
targeting
 
02:16:22.870 --> 02:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
mostly full-time employees
 
02:16:25.350 --> 02:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
of the county
 
02:16:25.360 --> 02:16:27.990 align:start position:0%
of the county
and

02:16:27.990 --> 02:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:29.030 align:start position:0%
 
those

02:16:29.030 --> 02:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:16:31.270 --> 02:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
who are part-time employees like those
 
02:16:33.190 --> 02:16:33.200 align:start position:0%
those of us sitting around the table
 
02:16:33.200 --> 02:16:34.709 align:start position:0%
those of us sitting around the table
here

02:16:34.709 --> 02:16:34.719 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:16:35.669 --> 02:16:35.679 align:start position:0%
we do
 
02:16:37.990 --> 02:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
we would be stay in the
 
02:16:39.669 --> 02:16:39.679 align:start position:0%
every two year election but we have a
 
02:16:43.750 --> 02:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:43.760 --> 02:16:45.589 align:start position:0%
 
the

02:16:45.589 --> 02:16:45.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:16:47.509 --> 02:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
example is brought up about the sheriff
 
02:16:50.309 --> 02:16:50.319 align:start position:0%
we want this we want the sheriff
 
02:16:50.319 --> 02:16:51.349 align:start position:0%
we want this we want the sheriff
out

02:16:51.349 --> 02:16:51.359 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:16:54.150 --> 02:16:54.160 align:start position:0%
keeping the peace
 
02:16:56.629 --> 02:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
arresting people need to be arrested
 
02:16:58.309 --> 02:16:58.319 align:start position:0%
putting people in jail that need be put
 
02:16:59.429 --> 02:16:59.439 align:start position:0%
in jail
 
02:17:02.309 --> 02:17:02.319 align:start position:0%
and so forth same thing with the
 
02:17:04.549 --> 02:17:04.559 align:start position:0%
county attorney we would hope that
 
02:17:07.990 --> 02:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
county attorney would be spending
 
02:17:11.190 --> 02:17:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:12.709 --> 02:17:12.719 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
02:17:14.389 --> 02:17:14.399 align:start position:0%
convictions and
 
02:17:14.399 --> 02:17:16.469 align:start position:0%
convictions and
uh

02:17:16.469 --> 02:17:16.479 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:17:19.110 --> 02:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
bringing uh bringing actions against
 
02:17:20.790 --> 02:17:20.800 align:start position:0%
those people that need it
 
02:17:22.469 --> 02:17:22.479 align:start position:0%
as opposed to
 
02:17:25.750 --> 02:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh for example the county for a sheriff
 
02:17:28.549 --> 02:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
to be standing on the corner
 
02:17:32.309 --> 02:17:32.319 align:start position:0%
with a couple of cardboard signs
 
02:17:36.469 --> 02:17:36.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:41.270 --> 02:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:43.589 --> 02:17:43.599 align:start position:0%
working as a sheriff as opposed to
 
02:17:45.429 --> 02:17:45.439 align:start position:0%
working as a candidate
 
02:17:46.870 --> 02:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
02:17:49.349 --> 02:17:49.359 align:start position:0%
that's those are my comments
 
02:17:51.509 --> 02:17:51.519 align:start position:0%
i i and i would uh
 
02:17:53.990 --> 02:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
i think this
 
02:17:57.270 --> 02:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
generally general support for this
 
02:17:57.280 --> 02:17:58.389 align:start position:0%
generally general support for this
across

02:17:58.389 --> 02:17:58.399 align:start position:0%
across
 
02:18:01.190 --> 02:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
uh both both aisles
 
02:18:03.589 --> 02:18:03.599 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:18:06.950 --> 02:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
so i think we we would make a
 
02:18:09.509 --> 02:18:09.519 align:start position:0%
a strong statement
 
02:18:09.519 --> 02:18:10.389 align:start position:0%
a strong statement
if

02:18:10.389 --> 02:18:10.399 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:18:12.389 --> 02:18:12.399 align:start position:0%
this passed
 
02:18:12.399 --> 02:18:14.150 align:start position:0%
this passed
unanimously

02:18:14.150 --> 02:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
unanimously
 
02:18:16.389 --> 02:18:16.399 align:start position:0%
yes representative wrong yeah i'd also
 
02:18:18.469 --> 02:18:18.479 align:start position:0%
like to say that since we had the public
 
02:18:20.309 --> 02:18:20.319 align:start position:0%
hearing i've heard from other county
 
02:18:23.349 --> 02:18:23.359 align:start position:0%
attorneys who support this amendment
 
02:18:26.230 --> 02:18:26.240 align:start position:0%
i also ran it by the
 
02:18:27.910 --> 02:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
my county hillsborough county
 
02:18:29.990 --> 02:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner the chair
 
02:18:31.910 --> 02:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
ms pappas who also
 
02:18:33.349 --> 02:18:33.359 align:start position:0%
supports it
 
02:18:36.230 --> 02:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
and to get to mrs notter's point about
 
02:18:38.790 --> 02:18:38.800 align:start position:0%
or representative notter's point
 
02:18:41.990 --> 02:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
even the current county attorney is
 
02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:42.790 align:start position:0%
even the current county attorney is
under

02:18:42.790 --> 02:18:42.800 align:start position:0%
under
 
02:18:44.950 --> 02:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
more supervision from the attorney
 
02:18:46.549 --> 02:18:46.559 align:start position:0%
general's office
 
02:18:48.950 --> 02:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
it seems like it's a structural issue in
 
02:18:50.950 --> 02:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
that office and that
 
02:18:52.870 --> 02:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
having only two years and then having a
 
02:18:54.950 --> 02:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
change of leadership is very disruptive
 
02:18:57.349 --> 02:18:57.359 align:start position:0%
on the state level to be able to go in
 
02:18:59.750 --> 02:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
and provide support for counties so
 
02:19:01.750 --> 02:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
thank thank you all everyone in advance
 
02:19:03.589 --> 02:19:03.599 align:start position:0%
for your support
 
02:19:05.750 --> 02:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
okay are there any more comments yes i
 
02:19:05.760 --> 02:19:07.750 align:start position:0%
okay are there any more comments yes i
am

02:19:07.750 --> 02:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
am
 
02:19:09.349 --> 02:19:09.359 align:start position:0%
can you explain
 
02:19:12.469 --> 02:19:12.479 align:start position:0%
the difference between the language
 
02:19:13.990 --> 02:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry
 
02:19:15.509 --> 02:19:15.519 align:start position:0%
representative can you explain the
 
02:19:17.429 --> 02:19:17.439 align:start position:0%
language in
 
02:19:19.589 --> 02:19:19.599 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
02:19:22.389 --> 02:19:22.399 align:start position:0%
and why it is different other than i see
 
02:19:24.790 --> 02:19:24.800 align:start position:0%
the rockingham county on on the bill
 
02:19:26.150 --> 02:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
itself but
 
02:19:26.160 --> 02:19:27.910 align:start position:0%
itself but
um

02:19:27.910 --> 02:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:30.309 --> 02:19:30.319 align:start position:0%
i'm just a little bit confused with the
 
02:19:32.549 --> 02:19:32.559 align:start position:0%
language in both cases
 
02:19:35.750 --> 02:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
you know for example line line
 
02:19:37.750 --> 02:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
that's compared to that's talking about
 
02:19:39.270 --> 02:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
the county attorney
 
02:19:42.389 --> 02:19:42.399 align:start position:0%
and then um elected for four years on
 
02:19:43.910 --> 02:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
line 17
 
02:19:46.549 --> 02:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
it talks about all the other offices
 
02:19:48.710 --> 02:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
then we get down to the end of this i
 
02:19:51.510 --> 02:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
believe this one talks about the
 
02:19:51.520 --> 02:19:52.469 align:start position:0%
believe this one talks about the
um

02:19:52.469 --> 02:19:52.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:56.710 --> 02:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't talk about at all counties
 
02:19:58.710 --> 02:19:58.720 align:start position:0%
can you you point out where it says all
 
02:20:00.550 --> 02:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
counties on here for me
 
02:20:03.830 --> 02:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
just so i can catch it um
 
02:20:05.910 --> 02:20:05.920 align:start position:0%
my understanding from talking to the
 
02:20:08.309 --> 02:20:08.319 align:start position:0%
drafting attorney is that
 
02:20:11.750 --> 02:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
there's separations in the amendment
 
02:20:15.190 --> 02:20:15.200 align:start position:0%
as they are in the um the actual bill
 
02:20:17.190 --> 02:20:17.200 align:start position:0%
because of where the occurrence of
 
02:20:18.950 --> 02:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
vacancies is
 
02:20:21.830 --> 02:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the rsa so each rsa that
 
02:20:24.230 --> 02:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
addresses a vacancy
 
02:20:27.510 --> 02:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
for instance in rsa 7 colon 33 it's
 
02:20:29.990 --> 02:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
specific to county attorneys and their
 
02:20:31.349 --> 02:20:31.359 align:start position:0%
length of term
 
02:20:34.230 --> 02:20:34.240 align:start position:0%
so the amendment has to address not only
 
02:20:36.950 --> 02:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
that but other occurrences in the rsas
 
02:20:36.960 --> 02:20:37.830 align:start position:0%
that but other occurrences in the rsas
where

02:20:37.830 --> 02:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:20:40.469 --> 02:20:40.479 align:start position:0%
terms are mentioned
 
02:20:40.479 --> 02:20:41.670 align:start position:0%
terms are mentioned
the

02:20:41.670 --> 02:20:41.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:20:43.510 --> 02:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
if you look down on the amendment on
 
02:20:48.230 --> 02:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
line 15 it says amend rsa 653
 
02:20:50.070 --> 02:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
02:20:53.750 --> 02:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
one that addresses
 
02:20:55.670 --> 02:20:55.680 align:start position:0%
beginning you know like specifying
 
02:20:58.070 --> 02:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
beginning at the 2020 state general
 
02:21:00.389 --> 02:21:00.399 align:start position:0%
election it would begin
 
02:21:00.399 --> 02:21:02.469 align:start position:0%
election it would begin
um

02:21:02.469 --> 02:21:02.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:05.910 --> 02:21:05.920 align:start position:0%
in all counties yes yes so in each
 
02:21:07.990 --> 02:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
county you would consider that
 
02:21:09.349 --> 02:21:09.359 align:start position:0%
all counties
 
02:21:12.550 --> 02:21:12.560 align:start position:0%
for those people okay very good come on
 
02:21:16.150 --> 02:21:16.160 align:start position:0%
any further yes uh representatively
 
02:21:18.309 --> 02:21:18.319 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh mr chair and
 
02:21:19.510 --> 02:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:21:21.510 --> 02:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
kind of keying off of what uh rep
 
02:21:24.550 --> 02:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
representative piemonte said um
 
02:21:26.950 --> 02:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
the fact that it says an act relative to
 
02:21:29.990 --> 02:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
the length of terms for county officers
 
02:21:32.469 --> 02:21:32.479 align:start position:0%
where the original one said rockingham
 
02:21:34.389 --> 02:21:34.399 align:start position:0%
that's the clarification of that it's
 
02:21:36.630 --> 02:21:36.640 align:start position:0%
all counties and not just rockingham
 
02:21:36.640 --> 02:21:37.830 align:start position:0%
all counties and not just rockingham
county

02:21:37.830 --> 02:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
county
 
02:21:39.830 --> 02:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
do i have that correct
 
02:21:42.870 --> 02:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
yes it's all counties the um
 
02:21:44.790 --> 02:21:44.800 align:start position:0%
when representative piemonte noted on
 
02:21:46.950 --> 02:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
line 21 or 22 the reference to
 
02:21:49.750 --> 02:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
hillsborough county by including all
 
02:21:52.150 --> 02:21:52.160 align:start position:0%
counties including hillsborough county
 
02:21:54.389 --> 02:21:54.399 align:start position:0%
they have a specified way of filling
 
02:21:56.710 --> 02:21:56.720 align:start position:0%
vacancies that may not be consistent
 
02:21:59.030 --> 02:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
with other counties
 
02:22:00.790 --> 02:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
someday maybe we can make that
 
02:22:02.790 --> 02:22:02.800 align:start position:0%
consistent but for the purpose of this
 
02:22:04.469 --> 02:22:04.479 align:start position:0%
amendment it just extend it to all
 
02:22:04.479 --> 02:22:05.670 align:start position:0%
amendment it just extend it to all
counties

02:22:05.670 --> 02:22:05.680 align:start position:0%

the only it
 
02:27:09.590 --> 02:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
02:27:11.190 --> 02:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
the only
 
02:27:13.830 --> 02:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
and and i could be totally off base on
 
02:27:16.309 --> 02:27:16.319 align:start position:0%
this where where it says shall
 
02:27:19.429 --> 02:27:19.439 align:start position:0%
immediately report such incident
 
02:27:21.030 --> 02:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
and i'm
 
02:27:24.550 --> 02:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
wondering if the word immediately
 
02:27:26.870 --> 02:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
you know what does that mean i mean if
 
02:27:30.389 --> 02:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
it happens at 4 30 on a
 
02:27:32.870 --> 02:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
on a friday afternoon
 
02:27:33.830 --> 02:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:27:33.840 --> 02:27:35.590 align:start position:0%
you know
um

02:27:35.590 --> 02:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:38.150 --> 02:27:38.160 align:start position:0%
it just seems kind of
 
02:27:38.160 --> 02:27:41.429 align:start position:0%
it just seems kind of
um

02:27:41.429 --> 02:27:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:43.750 --> 02:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's not precise enough
 
02:27:45.910 --> 02:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
for me but i don't know
 
02:27:47.349 --> 02:27:47.359 align:start position:0%
i don't have any
 
02:27:50.950 --> 02:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
substitution for it but does anyone else
 
02:27:52.790 --> 02:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
have that an issue with the word
 
02:27:52.800 --> 02:27:57.190 align:start position:0%
have that an issue with the word
immediately

02:27:57.190 --> 02:27:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:57.200 --> 02:28:00.150 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:28:00.150 --> 02:28:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:02.550 --> 02:28:02.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i have no objection
 
02:28:04.950 --> 02:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
to the word immediately because you want
 
02:28:07.750 --> 02:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
to act on these things quickly the state
 
02:28:10.309 --> 02:28:10.319 align:start position:0%
needs to know as soon as possible in
 
02:28:12.630 --> 02:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
order to have the least amount of damage
 
02:28:16.150 --> 02:28:16.160 align:start position:0%
done to whatever trickery is going on
 
02:28:19.670 --> 02:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
so i have no problem with that word
 
02:28:22.630 --> 02:28:22.640 align:start position:0%
i t is typically 24 7.
 
02:28:25.190 --> 02:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
representative vann
 
02:28:28.150 --> 02:28:28.160 align:start position:0%
yeah i was going to say that usually i t
 
02:28:31.349 --> 02:28:31.359 align:start position:0%
responses are in fact 24 7. and if it
 
02:28:33.429 --> 02:28:33.439 align:start position:0%
happens at 4 30 on friday afternoon i
 
02:28:35.990 --> 02:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
think that's a really good argument for
 
02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:37.910 align:start position:0%
think that's a really good argument for
immediately

02:28:37.910 --> 02:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
immediately
 
02:28:40.309 --> 02:28:40.319 align:start position:0%
so that you can start the damage control
 
02:28:43.670 --> 02:28:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:45.990 --> 02:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
representative piemonte
 
02:28:49.030 --> 02:28:49.040 align:start position:0%
um i i uh
 
02:28:51.110 --> 02:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
i had a i'm sorry
 
02:28:54.230 --> 02:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
i had a conversation with the
 
02:28:56.950 --> 02:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner on this and
 
02:28:59.110 --> 02:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
the way it's written now uh some of
 
02:29:00.710 --> 02:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
these uh
 
02:29:03.750 --> 02:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh things that will happen in i.t will
 
02:29:05.429 --> 02:29:05.439 align:start position:0%
you know they'll delay
 
02:29:08.469 --> 02:29:08.479 align:start position:0%
he's and and one of the examples i did
 
02:29:10.309 --> 02:29:10.319 align:start position:0%
you hear it on the news before it was
 
02:29:11.830 --> 02:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
actually reported
 
02:29:13.510 --> 02:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
uh to the
 
02:29:16.550 --> 02:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
um department even with the 24-7 what
 
02:29:19.270 --> 02:29:19.280 align:start position:0%
this does bill does it enhances
 
02:29:21.349 --> 02:29:21.359 align:start position:0%
that so there is no
 
02:29:22.710 --> 02:29:22.720 align:start position:0%
lag time
 
02:29:23.990 --> 02:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
in the uh
 
02:29:25.830 --> 02:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
in the reporting of it
 
02:29:25.840 --> 02:29:27.110 align:start position:0%
in the reporting of it
so

02:29:27.110 --> 02:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:29:28.469 --> 02:29:28.479 align:start position:0%
that's all i have to say yes
 
02:29:30.630 --> 02:29:30.640 align:start position:0%
representative klee
 
02:29:33.510 --> 02:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
uh uh thank you miss um mr chairman and
 
02:29:35.590 --> 02:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
um i agree with my colleagues before
 
02:29:38.389 --> 02:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
that but at the same time i i do agree i
 
02:29:40.150 --> 02:29:40.160 align:start position:0%
had a little bit of immediate kind of
 
02:29:42.230 --> 02:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
made me a little bit anxious about it
 
02:29:44.150 --> 02:29:44.160 align:start position:0%
but i do agree with what everybody said
 
02:29:46.070 --> 02:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
here i think we need to put something at
 
02:29:48.469 --> 02:29:48.479 align:start position:0%
this in place so that all parties are
 
02:29:50.630 --> 02:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
notified as quickly as possible so we
 
02:29:52.710 --> 02:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
can mitigate any worsening of that
 
02:29:54.230 --> 02:29:54.240 align:start position:0%
particular situation because it can
 
02:29:56.550 --> 02:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
happen fast like a wildfire so
 
02:29:57.429 --> 02:29:57.439 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:29:59.190 --> 02:29:59.200 align:start position:0%
any additional comments
 
02:30:01.349 --> 02:30:01.359 align:start position:0%
on the bill
 
02:30:03.110 --> 02:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
oh yes representative
 
02:30:05.750 --> 02:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
i thank my colleagues for giving me a
 
02:30:09.349 --> 02:30:09.359 align:start position:0%
warm and fuzzy feeling in my stomach
 
02:30:13.510 --> 02:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:15.270 --> 02:30:15.280 align:start position:0%
i believe that
 
02:30:17.510 --> 02:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
the drafting attorneys would have
 
02:30:17.520 --> 02:30:18.790 align:start position:0%
the drafting attorneys would have
considered

02:30:18.790 --> 02:30:18.800 align:start position:0%
considered
 
02:30:21.670 --> 02:30:21.680 align:start position:0%
that language that's somewhat ambiguous
 
02:30:21.680 --> 02:30:22.630 align:start position:0%
that language that's somewhat ambiguous
and

02:30:22.630 --> 02:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:30:25.190 --> 02:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
it passed their test and i guess that's
 
02:30:25.200 --> 02:30:26.389 align:start position:0%
it passed their test and i guess that's
about

02:30:26.389 --> 02:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:30:29.510 --> 02:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
as good a legal argument that we can
 
02:30:31.510 --> 02:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
we can rest on
 
02:30:34.550 --> 02:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
okay are there any last comments
 
02:30:38.230 --> 02:30:38.240 align:start position:0%
