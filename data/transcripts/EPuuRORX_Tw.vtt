00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:12.479 align:start position:0%
amendment so we'll Begin by discussing
 
00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:14.039 align:start position:0%
the first
 
00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:16.280 align:start position:0%
bill and I mention the proposed
 
00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
amendments but I don't see copies of the
 
00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:20.919 align:start position:0%
Amendments so we'll have to uh we'll
 
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:32.120 align:start position:0%
that so we will uh arrange to get copies
 
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
of the all the Amendments shortly I did
 
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:39.240 align:start position:0%
send out amendments to the first bill
 
00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
we'll be discussing which is House Bill
 
00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.510 align:start position:0%
we'll be discussing which is House Bill
1697

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:42.520 align:start position:0%
1697
 
00:06:45.189 --> 00:06:45.199 align:start position:0%
FN the original title of which was to
 
00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:47.479 align:start position:0%
suspend New Hampshire's participation in
 
00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
emissions reduction credit programs for
 
00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
a period of two years and we do have an
 
00:06:56.589 --> 00:06:56.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:00.120 align:start position:0%
bill and we will have it it shortly but
 
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
everybody has received a copy in their
 
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
email so everybody should be aware of
 
00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:08.560 align:start position:0%
it essentially what the amendment does
 
00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.469 align:start position:0%
it essentially what the amendment does
is

00:07:11.469 --> 00:07:11.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:17.189 --> 00:07:17.199 align:start position:0%
it asks the relevant state agencies
 
00:07:21.189 --> 00:07:21.199 align:start position:0%
to look at Timber taxes and determine if
 
00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:25.240 align:start position:0%
there's a way to help cities and towns
 
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
that rely on Timber tax recover a lost
 
00:07:30.029 --> 00:07:30.039 align:start position:0%
Timber tax revenue
 
00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
that's the first section of the bill the
 
00:07:35.749 --> 00:07:35.759 align:start position:0%
second section of the bill sets up a
 
00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
registry of land Parcels that
 
00:07:44.149 --> 00:07:44.159 align:start position:0%
participate in carbon capture credit
 
00:07:47.629 --> 00:07:47.639 align:start position:0%
programs and uh so it's a relatively
 
00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:51.400 align:start position:0%
simple bill but it does two very
 
00:07:55.869 --> 00:07:55.879 align:start position:0%
important things and uh so I would
 
00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
entertain any discussion from members of
 
00:08:01.749 --> 00:08:01.759 align:start position:0%
the committee about this proposed
 
00:08:04.629 --> 00:08:04.639 align:start position:0%
amendment representative Thomas thank
 
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
you um Mr chair um just to clarify so
 
00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
there's no moratorium um in this we're
 
00:08:13.469 --> 00:08:13.479 align:start position:0%
this discussion we're we're eliminating
 
00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:15.400 align:start position:0%
any kind of a two-year moratorium or
 
00:08:17.189 --> 00:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
anything like that correct that is
 
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
correct thank you just clarifying
 
00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:22.680 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative muns
 
00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um I um I like the
 
00:08:29.309 --> 00:08:29.319 align:start position:0%
amendment um there were there were three
 
00:08:32.949 --> 00:08:32.959 align:start position:0%
issues that I heard during the testimony
 
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
one was a concern about loss tax
 
00:08:39.509 --> 00:08:39.519 align:start position:0%
revenues um um the timber tax so this
 
00:08:42.389 --> 00:08:42.399 align:start position:0%
this addresses that the other two were
 
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
um disruption to the timber industry and
 
00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:52.240 align:start position:0%
um um recreational access to lands and
 
00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:54.240 align:start position:0%
um I don't think we can address either
 
00:08:56.829 --> 00:08:56.839 align:start position:0%
of those other two until we know the
 
00:08:59.190 --> 00:08:59.200 align:start position:0%
universe uh that we're talking about and
 
00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
and I think the registry addresses that
 
00:09:07.269 --> 00:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
so um uh and then also um any any
 
00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:09.200 align:start position:0%
discussion or consideration of any kind
 
00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
of a tax on carbon credits that the
 
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:14.200 align:start position:0%
state may want to impose to recover
 
00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
Revenue you need to you need to know um
 
00:09:19.829 --> 00:09:19.839 align:start position:0%
again what land you're talking about so
 
00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:22.200 align:start position:0%
I I think the amendment does a nice job
 
00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:25.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
forward thank you press the wrong button
 
00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
rep Vice chair Thomas uh thank you Mr
 
00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
chair um yes I like this amendment too I
 
00:09:35.949 --> 00:09:35.959 align:start position:0%
do have a question just for
 
00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:38.800 align:start position:0%
clarification because we talked about
 
00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
other methods in establishing a registry
 
00:09:45.389 --> 00:09:45.399 align:start position:0%
uh is the division of farsy do they all
 
00:09:47.389 --> 00:09:47.399 align:start position:0%
do they already have a registry and this
 
00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
is just a simple um addition to it or
 
00:09:53.389 --> 00:09:53.399 align:start position:0%
how do they intend to U establish and
 
00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
maintain a
 
00:09:58.790 --> 00:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
registry this is the state agency that
 
00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
takes takes care of Timber taxes they
 
00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
have a Timber tax form so they are
 
00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:07.320 align:start position:0%
already versed in the business of
 
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
creating forms
 
00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
and tracking data related to Timberland
 
00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:18.160 align:start position:0%
owners so so we don't need to to go to
 
00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:22.360 align:start position:0%
the grer of Deeds then we do not okay
 
00:10:24.389 --> 00:10:24.399 align:start position:0%
good any further discussion
 
00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:27.200 align:start position:0%
representative reels yes thank you Mr
 
00:10:30.509 --> 00:10:30.519 align:start position:0%
chairman um yeah like others I
 
00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
appreciate um very much like the
 
00:10:36.269 --> 00:10:36.279 align:start position:0%
amendment I think the original bill was
 
00:10:36.279 --> 00:10:37.150 align:start position:0%
amendment I think the original bill was
kind

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:37.160 align:start position:0%
kind
 
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
of you know it was naming a problem but
 
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
it was proposing a solution that wasn't
 
00:10:45.069 --> 00:10:45.079 align:start position:0%
actually uh within the power of the
 
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
state to do
 
00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:51.880 align:start position:0%
um and so this bill does two things that
 
00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:53.480 align:start position:0%
will move the
 
00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
state and the
 
00:10:58.550 --> 00:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh concerned you know
 
00:10:58.560 --> 00:10:59.550 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh concerned you know
closer

00:10:59.550 --> 00:10:59.560 align:start position:0%
closer
 
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:04.240 align:start position:0%
to it'll it'll perhaps enable a
 
00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
solution uh to the ultimate problem
 
00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:11.160 align:start position:0%
of you know L Timber tax revenue uh to
 
00:11:13.069 --> 00:11:13.079 align:start position:0%
the municipalities to
 
00:11:18.269 --> 00:11:18.279 align:start position:0%
emerge um yeah so thank you I like it
 
00:11:18.279 --> 00:11:19.590 align:start position:0%
emerge um yeah so thank you I like it
representative

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
Harrington um first a question I guess a
 
00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
statement uh I'm really uh concerned
 
00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
about this underlying um Bill RSA 7795 I
 
00:11:33.389 --> 00:11:33.399 align:start position:0%
believe uh I don't think it's apparently
 
00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:34.760 align:start position:0%
it's never been implemented which is a
 
00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:37.000 align:start position:0%
good thing but telling people they have
 
00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:38.920 align:start position:0%
to pay additional taxes for not cutting
 
00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
wood on their own land I find very
 
00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:43.000 align:start position:0%
troubling in fact I think that law would
 
00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
probably be thrown out by the courts
 
00:11:46.829 --> 00:11:46.839 align:start position:0%
because it's vague and there is no
 
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
requirement for size of the of the lot
 
00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:52.760 align:start position:0%
or it's so subject to uh interpretation
 
00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
as with who thinks when's it's mature
 
00:11:57.710 --> 00:11:57.720 align:start position:0%
and when it isn't that's that's the
 
00:11:59.949 --> 00:11:59.959 align:start position:0%
underlying problem that with the bill
 
00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:03.800 align:start position:0%
itself I'm a little uh confused it says
 
00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:05.680 align:start position:0%
including requirements for owners of
 
00:12:09.069 --> 00:12:09.079 align:start position:0%
such land to file notice of enrollment
 
00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
so if someone has land and they decide
 
00:12:13.269 --> 00:12:13.279 align:start position:0%
to enroll in one of these carbon capture
 
00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:16.240 align:start position:0%
ones then they will have an obligation
 
00:12:20.189 --> 00:12:20.199 align:start position:0%
to uh contact the estate and and list
 
00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:22.760 align:start position:0%
the the land in this registry how are
 
00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:24.160 align:start position:0%
they going to be made aware of that
 
00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:27.870 align:start position:0%
they going to be made aware of that
registration

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:27.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:33.790 align:start position:0%
 
requirement

00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:33.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:36.069 --> 00:12:36.079 align:start position:0%
I think the way the legislation is
 
00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
worded is
 
00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:42.310 align:start position:0%
worded is
that

00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:48.040 align:start position:0%
the forest uh agency the relevant Forest
 
00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:51.720 align:start position:0%
agency will require that this form be
 
00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
submitted and then it's public
 
00:12:59.790 --> 00:12:59.800 align:start position:0%
information it goes into a u file of sim
 
00:13:02.189 --> 00:13:02.199 align:start position:0%
ilar just a followup maybe a little
 
00:13:03.949 --> 00:13:03.959 align:start position:0%
confusion Mr chairman what what I'm
 
00:13:07.629 --> 00:13:07.639 align:start position:0%
saying is so I own uh 500 acres of land
 
00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
someplace in New Hampshire and I decide
 
00:13:13.829 --> 00:13:13.839 align:start position:0%
I want to put it into a carbon um
 
00:13:16.949 --> 00:13:16.959 align:start position:0%
capture program uh how am I made aware
 
00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
that I have to file something with the
 
00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:22.240 align:start position:0%
state on that how do I even know this
 
00:13:24.629 --> 00:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
exists I guess in the same way that
 
00:13:27.189 --> 00:13:27.199 align:start position:0%
anyone would become aware of other laws
 
00:13:29.629 --> 00:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
that get passed by the state and
 
00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
followup go ahead is there any there's
 
00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:34.720 align:start position:0%
no mention of a size limit nor is there
 
00:13:37.629 --> 00:13:37.639 align:start position:0%
in the bill 795 that I was referencing
 
00:13:40.829 --> 00:13:40.839 align:start position:0%
so if somebody has four acres of land
 
00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
and they decide they want to put it into
 
00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:45.800 align:start position:0%
carbon capture a private person um
 
00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:47.560 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to somehow track down
 
00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:49.839 align:start position:0%
this law and file it and if they don't
 
00:13:52.069 --> 00:13:52.079 align:start position:0%
file is there any punishment because I
 
00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
see nothing about here if someone
 
00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:56.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't file that there would be a fine
 
00:13:59.310 --> 00:13:59.320 align:start position:0%
or something else you you are correct
 
00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
there is no punishment in this
 
00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:03.509 align:start position:0%
there is no punishment in this
particular

00:14:03.509 --> 00:14:03.519 align:start position:0%
particular
 
00:14:06.629 --> 00:14:06.639 align:start position:0%
statute I don't know what other
 
00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
inforcement statutes may be in
 
00:14:14.829 --> 00:14:14.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:18.440 align:start position:0%
chance Mr Hackley yeah sorry I got your
 
00:14:21.269 --> 00:14:21.279 align:start position:0%
name wrong do you have any enforcement
 
00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:24.120 align:start position:0%
mechanisms to uh if you could come up to
 
00:14:26.069 --> 00:14:26.079 align:start position:0%
the table and turn on the mic and let us
 
00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:28.120 align:start position:0%
know what you have for and Mr chairman
 
00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
just to clarify again there doesn't seem
 
00:14:32.829 --> 00:14:32.839 align:start position:0%
to be a size limit in this so is if I
 
00:14:35.949 --> 00:14:35.959 align:start position:0%
have uh like I say if I have four acres
 
00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
and I'm a dedicated California carbon
 
00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:41.720 align:start position:0%
lover so I decide to buy carbon credits
 
00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:44.120 align:start position:0%
uh am I supposed to report this or is it
 
00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:47.240 align:start position:0%
a minimum of 500 Acres or
 
00:14:49.269 --> 00:14:49.279 align:start position:0%
whatever now it looks to me like the
 
00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:53.160 align:start position:0%
legislation specifies that um you would
 
00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:56.120 align:start position:0%
report your acreage as part of the form
 
00:14:59.189 --> 00:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
that the agency will create but Mr
 
00:15:00.629 --> 00:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
Hackley if you could explain if you have
 
00:15:02.749 --> 00:15:02.759 align:start position:0%
any enforcement
 
00:15:06.069 --> 00:15:06.079 align:start position:0%
Powers we we have none relative to this
 
00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:08.440 align:start position:0%
amendment as proposed we were not
 
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
involved in the drafting so didn't have
 
00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:14.440 align:start position:0%
time to discuss that okay thank
 
00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
you Vice chair Thomas uh thank you Mr
 
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
chair uh so
 
00:15:21.749 --> 00:15:21.759 align:start position:0%
uh previous representative's comments
 
00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
begs the question uh of the carbon
 
00:15:28.629 --> 00:15:28.639 align:start position:0%
capture program would it even be econom
 
00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
IAL or worth the effort for such a small
 
00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:33.720 align:start position:0%
amount of acreage to be involved in that
 
00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:35.800 align:start position:0%
program in other words what what's the
 
00:15:38.069 --> 00:15:38.079 align:start position:0%
actual practicality of of who would sign
 
00:15:41.069 --> 00:15:41.079 align:start position:0%
up uh if you have four acres is that too
 
00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:43.880 align:start position:0%
little uh so is there someone out there
 
00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
that can say that no one would even dare
 
00:15:49.069 --> 00:15:49.079 align:start position:0%
uh join the program unless they had a
 
00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:50.600 align:start position:0%
certain number of Acres anyway just for
 
00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:55.550 align:start position:0%
certain number of Acres anyway just for
economics

00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
purpose interesting question don't know
 
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
the answer rep representative liwicki uh
 
00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:02.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I would think that
 
00:16:04.509 --> 00:16:04.519 align:start position:0%
the Registries of deeds and the real
 
00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
estate lawyers would become aware of
 
00:16:08.629 --> 00:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
this if the we if the word trickles down
 
00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
to the Registries of Deeds then they
 
00:16:14.309 --> 00:16:14.319 align:start position:0%
would uh obviously be able to uh inform
 
00:16:16.749 --> 00:16:16.759 align:start position:0%
people of it I would think when when
 
00:16:24.069 --> 00:16:24.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
made okay we have hard copies now of the
 
00:16:27.519 --> 00:16:30.030 align:start position:0%
made okay we have hard copies now of the
amendment

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:30.040 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:16:32.749 --> 00:16:32.759 align:start position:0%
oh I will pass that out pass these out
 
00:16:32.759 --> 00:16:36.389 align:start position:0%
oh I will pass that out pass these out
to

00:16:36.389 --> 00:16:36.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:40.389 --> 00:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
everybody so uh representative licki I
 
00:16:42.069 --> 00:16:42.079 align:start position:0%
was distracted there for a moment could
 
00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:43.720 align:start position:0%
you repeat your
 
00:16:46.829 --> 00:16:46.839 align:start position:0%
question that yes um I would think that
 
00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
if we were to do this the Registries of
 
00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
Deeds would be able to promulgate the
 
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
word and the real estate lawyers are you
 
00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:57.160 align:start position:0%
know would then get the word
 
00:16:59.910 --> 00:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
also I think you you're right and I'd
 
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
remind everybody that I think the
 
00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
purpose of this amendment is to get us
 
00:17:08.909 --> 00:17:08.919 align:start position:0%
started in trying to form some kind of a
 
00:17:13.429 --> 00:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
response to a relatively new development
 
00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:15.160 align:start position:0%
that is beginning to affect New
 
00:17:17.909 --> 00:17:17.919 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Forest lands this is all very
 
00:17:17.919 --> 00:17:21.590 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Forest lands this is all very
new

00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:24.029 --> 00:17:24.039 align:start position:0%
and representatives from the North
 
00:17:26.909 --> 00:17:26.919 align:start position:0%
Country came to us and said this is a
 
00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
problem we have a potential solution the
 
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
moratorium that wasn't a real
 
00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
solution so
 
00:17:37.789 --> 00:17:37.799 align:start position:0%
we talked to a bunch of people a bunch
 
00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:40.440 align:start position:0%
of stakeholders and came up with this as
 
00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
a starting point to get uh something
 
00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:48.360 align:start position:0%
moving forward that could find a
 
00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
long-term solution to this problem
 
00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:53.720 align:start position:0%
eventually this is a short-term solution
 
00:17:55.549 --> 00:17:55.559 align:start position:0%
or the first step in a long-term
 
00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
solution so I think that's all we can
 
00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
expect from this amendment but I do
 
00:18:01.669 --> 00:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
think it's a good first start
 
00:18:01.679 --> 00:18:03.029 align:start position:0%
think it's a good first start
representative

00:18:03.029 --> 00:18:03.039 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
McGee thank you Mr chairman um so the
 
00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
first section of the bill instructs the
 
00:18:11.549 --> 00:18:11.559 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue Administration to
 
00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:13.960 align:start position:0%
review uh conduct a study on the issues
 
00:18:17.149 --> 00:18:17.159 align:start position:0%
related to Lost uh Timber attac Revenue
 
00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:19.720 align:start position:0%
which I think is certainly appropriate
 
00:18:22.549 --> 00:18:22.559 align:start position:0%
um I believe that Mr hackley's uh
 
00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:24.440 align:start position:0%
participation or attempted participation
 
00:18:28.549 --> 00:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
in the hearings um for his Department
 
00:18:31.669 --> 00:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
suggest that perhaps uh th this
 
00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:34.720 align:start position:0%
amendment might want to include uh his
 
00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
division of forest and lands as well in
 
00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:39.400 align:start position:0%
these conversations around what is going
 
00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
on with the changing you know the
 
00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
changing economics of forest land in New
 
00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because I think he ultimately
 
00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:50.720 align:start position:0%
would be required to help administer
 
00:18:53.669 --> 00:18:53.679 align:start position:0%
this if I'm understanding uh correctly
 
00:18:57.029 --> 00:18:57.039 align:start position:0%
with the registry and and also um he has
 
00:18:58.630 --> 00:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
a better understanding if there are
 
00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:01.000 align:start position:0%
going to be any cut offs in terms of the
 
00:19:02.549 --> 00:19:02.559 align:start position:0%
amount of land that that should be
 
00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
affected or reviewed or um that you know
 
00:19:07.669 --> 00:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
he would have probably the appropriate
 
00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:11.320 align:start position:0%
input there whereas Dr may not so I I
 
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
would just suggest that perhaps we could
 
00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
um add language to include that
 
00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:21.400 align:start position:0%
department uh in the study rather than
 
00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:27.789 --> 00:19:27.799 align:start position:0%
thought thank you uh representative
 
00:19:27.799 --> 00:19:30.070 align:start position:0%
thought thank you uh representative
Kaplan

00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
Kaplan
 
00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chair um I agree with
 
00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
uh representative Harrington's view that
 
00:19:36.789 --> 00:19:36.799 align:start position:0%
the underlying bill 79.5 is a little bit
 
00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
troubling in terms of telling people
 
00:19:39.669 --> 00:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
what to do with their land and their
 
00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
resources but I don't see any mention of
 
00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
that Statute in in the in in the first
 
00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
section so am I right or am I wrong that
 
00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
that is not really uh you know you are
 
00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
correct there is no mention of 795 thank
 
00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:54.760 align:start position:0%
you representative Ms thank you Mr chair
 
00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
um I would I just did a little quick
 
00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
Google search and there is a um family
 
00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
forest carbon program that covers Maine
 
00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:08.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Vermont New York
 
00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:10.440 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and one of their
 
00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:12.640 align:start position:0%
eligibility requirements is that you
 
00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:16.559 align:start position:0%
must own 30 or more Acres of non-planted
 
00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
naturally regenerating trees on a
 
00:20:20.909 --> 00:20:20.919 align:start position:0%
property so so to representative I think
 
00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
it was Harrington's Point um we probably
 
00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
should put something in there about a um
 
00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:30.520 align:start position:0%
a a minimum and this is just one program
 
00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:33.880 align:start position:0%
but they clearly aren't looking to pick
 
00:20:35.909 --> 00:20:35.919 align:start position:0%
up people like the 4 acre example that
 
00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:44.789 --> 00:20:44.799 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh representative
 
00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:47.320 align:start position:0%
Bernardi thank you Mr chair uh further
 
00:20:49.669 --> 00:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
to that point of of size I think we
 
00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
heard in the testimony that there was
 
00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:55.720 align:start position:0%
the possibility that several small land
 
00:21:00.029 --> 00:21:00.039 align:start position:0%
owners with 2 3 4 58 acers would get
 
00:21:04.909 --> 00:21:04.919 align:start position:0%
together and aggregate uh their forested
 
00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh properties and then offer them as a
 
00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
group so that's another possibility to
 
00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
amendment well seeing none I guess we're
 
00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
all done discussing this
 
00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
amendment uh it has been suggested that
 
00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:37.269 align:start position:0%
amendment uh it has been suggested that
we

00:21:37.269 --> 00:21:37.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:41.480 align:start position:0%
add the forestry folks to section one
 
00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
although if I'm the Department of
 
00:21:44.909 --> 00:21:44.919 align:start position:0%
Revenue Administration and I've been
 
00:21:48.269 --> 00:21:48.279 align:start position:0%
tasked with conducting a study related
 
00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:50.200 align:start position:0%
to Lost Timber tax revenue I think one
 
00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:52.600 align:start position:0%
of the first people I'm going to go talk
 
00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:55.480 align:start position:0%
to is the folks in the
 
00:21:58.549 --> 00:21:58.559 align:start position:0%
U the agency that's responsible
 
00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
for Timber tax and all that so I'm not
 
00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
sure that language is
 
00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:07.000 align:start position:0%
needed and with regard to specifying
 
00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:10.360 align:start position:0%
some kind of an acreage in order to
 
00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
be required to to make a filing for this
 
00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:17.190 align:start position:0%
be required to to make a filing for this
public

00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:17.200 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
registry as representative Bernardi
 
00:22:23.149 --> 00:22:23.159 align:start position:0%
pointed out if you can aggregate
 
00:22:23.159 --> 00:22:24.750 align:start position:0%
pointed out if you can aggregate
small

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:24.760 align:start position:0%
small
 
00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
Parcels then I don't think we need to
 
00:22:33.149 --> 00:22:33.159 align:start position:0%
specify a minimum acreage level I think
 
00:22:34.669 --> 00:22:34.679 align:start position:0%
we should just keep track of all the
 
00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
land and the AG acreages would be one of
 
00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
the things that's specified in the
 
00:22:42.909 --> 00:22:42.919 align:start position:0%
registry so all that information would
 
00:22:44.669 --> 00:22:44.679 align:start position:0%
be there and that that's the purpose of
 
00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:47.240 align:start position:0%
the registry is to compile information
 
00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
about Forest lands that might someday be
 
00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:52.640 align:start position:0%
used for this purpose representative
 
00:22:54.909 --> 00:22:54.919 align:start position:0%
Thomas um just a point of clarification
 
00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
or just I'm asking for clarification
 
00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:01.240 align:start position:0%
this AG ation program is that is that
 
00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
currently in effect or is it anticipated
 
00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
to be in effect at some
 
00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
point I don't know of any existing
 
00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
aggregations but I don't know of
 
00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
anything that would prevent them either
 
00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
right okay
 
00:23:18.269 --> 00:23:18.279 align:start position:0%
thanks representative Harrington yeah I
 
00:23:19.909 --> 00:23:19.919 align:start position:0%
I don't keep Haring on the point but I
 
00:23:22.549 --> 00:23:22.559 align:start position:0%
just think that whether you aggregate or
 
00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
don't aggregate I think if we look to
 
00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
the people that are involved in this
 
00:23:26.909 --> 00:23:26.919 align:start position:0%
thing they're not concerned about
 
00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:28.840 align:start position:0%
someone's 5 acre lot that's not being
 
00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
cut uh whether it's not being cut for
 
00:23:33.669 --> 00:23:33.679 align:start position:0%
example my 5 acre lot is not being cut
 
00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:36.360 align:start position:0%
and then 795 probably at least half of
 
00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:39.720 align:start position:0%
it would qualify to uh be forced Timber
 
00:23:42.029 --> 00:23:42.039 align:start position:0%
tax uh but no one's doing that because
 
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
it's a 5 acre lot um so I do think
 
00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:47.240 align:start position:0%
realistically we ought to set some type
 
00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:50.240 align:start position:0%
of a limit on this and say you know uh
 
00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:52.200 align:start position:0%
acreage even if we want to say
 
00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
aggregated or or or single Lots uh in
 
00:23:58.430 --> 00:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
excess of 100 acres because I don't
 
00:24:00.149 --> 00:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
think anyone's worried about the 5 acre
 
00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
so representative McGee thank you Mr
 
00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
chairman um we received you know a bunch
 
00:24:16.909 --> 00:24:16.919 align:start position:0%
of information electronically and one of
 
00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
them was the proposed form from the New
 
00:24:20.549 --> 00:24:20.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Revenue
 
00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:22.640 align:start position:0%
Administration notice of intent to cut
 
00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
wood or
 
00:24:28.029 --> 00:24:28.039 align:start position:0%
Timber um and the suggestion that a 58
 
00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
be added for acreage of lot and acreage
 
00:24:35.389 --> 00:24:35.399 align:start position:0%
of cut and so it's suggesting that that
 
00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
um collection of data be added to this
 
00:24:39.789 --> 00:24:39.799 align:start position:0%
form but that would only be if you were
 
00:24:42.909 --> 00:24:42.919 align:start position:0%
intent to cut right so is it is it still
 
00:24:45.669 --> 00:24:45.679 align:start position:0%
going to help us uh in terms of pulling
 
00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
together a registry because if someone
 
00:24:50.549 --> 00:24:50.559 align:start position:0%
isn't isn't doing sustainable forestry
 
00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:52.360 align:start position:0%
and isn't cutting the wood how would we
 
00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:56.480 align:start position:0%
know I mean I guess I'm just wondering
 
00:24:58.310 --> 00:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
how hard it's going to be to to pull
 
00:25:00.789 --> 00:25:00.799 align:start position:0%
together a comprehensive registry uh if
 
00:25:02.149 --> 00:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
this is the only place we're collecting
 
00:25:02.159 --> 00:25:04.990 align:start position:0%
this is the only place we're collecting
that

00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:10.269 --> 00:25:10.279 align:start position:0%
data so on line 14 of the amendment it
 
00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:13.240 align:start position:0%
says that there will be establishment
 
00:25:15.549 --> 00:25:15.559 align:start position:0%
and maintenance of a public registry
 
00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:20.240 align:start position:0%
listing Forest lands located within New
 
00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:22.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that are enrolled in one or
 
00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
more carbon
 
00:25:27.789 --> 00:25:27.799 align:start position:0%
programs so if there is a 30 acre men
 
00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
minimum for example to enroll on a
 
00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:32.760 align:start position:0%
carbon program then you wouldn't have
 
00:25:38.029 --> 00:25:38.039 align:start position:0%
to be listed in this registry
 
00:25:38.039 --> 00:25:41.590 align:start position:0%
to be listed in this registry
right

00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:44.669 --> 00:25:44.679 align:start position:0%
so I think this language is adequate but
 
00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:47.960 align:start position:0%
I'm open to language changes if anybody
 
00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:50.200 align:start position:0%
wants to suggest some
 
00:25:53.789 --> 00:25:53.799 align:start position:0%
so representative months so that that
 
00:25:55.549 --> 00:25:55.559 align:start position:0%
that that's a good point Mr chairman I
 
00:25:58.750 --> 00:25:58.760 align:start position:0%
mean what this bill is really doing is
 
00:26:01.149 --> 00:26:01.159 align:start position:0%
tracking land that has already been
 
00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
enrolled in a program and and I think
 
00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
your point is is accurate I mean if if
 
00:26:08.549 --> 00:26:08.559 align:start position:0%
the program requirements are 30 acres
 
00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:17.880 align:start position:0%
exactly any further discussion Mr
 
00:26:20.389 --> 00:26:20.399 align:start position:0%
Hackley certainly come up come up to the
 
00:26:24.389 --> 00:26:24.399 align:start position:0%
table and share with us your
 
00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:26.320 align:start position:0%
perspective I know this might be out of
 
00:26:28.389 --> 00:26:28.399 align:start position:0%
De Quorum for someone come in in a work
 
00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
session but I see you're struggling with
 
00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
the reason why we're doing this so if
 
00:26:34.269 --> 00:26:34.279 align:start position:0%
we're going to go through this and our
 
00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
agency is going to collect this data it
 
00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:38.360 align:start position:0%
it needs to be as meaningful and useful
 
00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:39.269 align:start position:0%
it needs to be as meaningful and useful
as

00:26:39.269 --> 00:26:39.279 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:41.720 align:start position:0%
possible and I hear the discussion about
 
00:26:44.549 --> 00:26:44.559 align:start position:0%
acreage limitations and as you learned
 
00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
from Mr L when he gave his presentation
 
00:26:49.549 --> 00:26:49.559 align:start position:0%
on carbon 101 the voluntary Market has
 
00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:51.200 align:start position:0%
all kinds of requirements you can have
 
00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
10 acres you can have 30 Acres there's
 
00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
different minimums what we're trying to
 
00:26:57.830 --> 00:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
quantify here in this trend toward Wards
 
00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:00.760 align:start position:0%
carbon credit programs is the total
 
00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:01.640 align:start position:0%
number of
 
00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:04.120 align:start position:0%
Acres so whether you've enrolled five
 
00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:07.480 align:start position:0%
acres or 500 Aces this registry should
 
00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
try to capture that because that's what
 
00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:11.080 align:start position:0%
we're trying to quantify is how many
 
00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
landowners are engaged in carbon credit
 
00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
programs and how many acres are enrolled
 
00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
that's how we we look at Trends in the
 
00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:20.840 align:start position:0%
forest products industry and in in the
 
00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
forestry Community is is about acreage
 
00:27:26.789 --> 00:27:26.799 align:start position:0%
so if you put a limit on it and saying
 
00:27:28.149 --> 00:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
well you don't have to file in the
 
00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
registry because you're you're under 30
 
00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:31.880 align:start position:0%
Acres we're going to lose that data
 
00:27:33.909 --> 00:27:33.919 align:start position:0%
we're going to lose the the trend that
 
00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
may we don't know where this is going if
 
00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:38.360 align:start position:0%
it's going to be you know like Gang
 
00:27:39.909 --> 00:27:39.919 align:start position:0%
Busters or if it's just going to fizzle
 
00:27:41.549 --> 00:27:41.559 align:start position:0%
under its own weight of credibility but
 
00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:43.640 align:start position:0%
at the for now if we're going to make a
 
00:27:46.389 --> 00:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
registry let's make sure that we collect
 
00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:50.440 align:start position:0%
data that's meaningful and so that's why
 
00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
I urg the chair and I I'm grateful for
 
00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
him to include the number of Acres
 
00:27:56.509 --> 00:27:56.519 align:start position:0%
actually it's the number of Acres
 
00:27:59.110 --> 00:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
enrolled so if you own 100 acres you
 
00:28:01.509 --> 00:28:01.519 align:start position:0%
might only want to enroll 50 acres so
 
00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
that's what we want to know you've
 
00:28:05.149 --> 00:28:05.159 align:start position:0%
you've enrolled a portion of your tax
 
00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:07.640 align:start position:0%
lot so that again we're we're looking at
 
00:28:10.029 --> 00:28:10.039 align:start position:0%
Trends total amount of acres per Town
 
00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
Per County and per state so that we can
 
00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:15.880 align:start position:0%
make informed policymaking should we
 
00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
need to regarding the tax question that
 
00:28:21.389 --> 00:28:21.399 align:start position:0%
is the first part of this amendment is
 
00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
that helpful chairman so you would like
 
00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:27.240 align:start position:0%
us to change the language in on line 25
 
00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:30.200 align:start position:0%
to say acreage of subject land
 
00:28:33.070 --> 00:28:33.080 align:start position:0%
enrolled that would be more specific and
 
00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
it would help because otherwise I think
 
00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
the land owner might just say oh well my
 
00:28:39.389 --> 00:28:39.399 align:start position:0%
tax lot is 250 Acres I'm just going to
 
00:28:42.669 --> 00:28:42.679 align:start position:0%
say 250 Acres but that's not necessarily
 
00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:44.600 align:start position:0%
accurate if they've only enrolled 100
 
00:28:49.029 --> 00:28:49.039 align:start position:0%
acres or 200 Acres see what I'm saying I
 
00:28:51.789 --> 00:28:51.799 align:start position:0%
do do you have any other
 
00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:54.440 align:start position:0%
suggestion changes to this amendment do
 
00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
you need a copy uh thank you um
 
00:29:00.269 --> 00:29:00.279 align:start position:0%
I I think that's the the the main thing
 
00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:02.120 align:start position:0%
I mean we're going to have to uh Draft
 
00:29:04.549 --> 00:29:04.559 align:start position:0%
rules for this but I do think the
 
00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
notification process that was brought up
 
00:29:09.029 --> 00:29:09.039 align:start position:0%
by um one of the committee members is an
 
00:29:10.669 --> 00:29:10.679 align:start position:0%
important one how are land owners going
 
00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
to know about this um many timber land
 
00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
owners know about intent to cut and that
 
00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
they have to pay Timber taxes but we may
 
00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:20.320 align:start position:0%
need to um come up with a means of
 
00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:22.600 align:start position:0%
communicating through the towns that a
 
00:29:25.269 --> 00:29:25.279 align:start position:0%
new law has been passed if this in fact
 
00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
makes it all the way through and becomes
 
00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
law so a notification process is an
 
00:29:31.669 --> 00:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
important aspect of this to the land
 
00:29:31.679 --> 00:29:33.630 align:start position:0%
important aspect of this to the land
owners

00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:33.640 align:start position:0%
owners
 
00:29:36.389 --> 00:29:36.399 align:start position:0%
um and maybe an annual report that we
 
00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:37.960 align:start position:0%
put out each year that the number of
 
00:29:41.870 --> 00:29:41.880 align:start position:0%
acres per County per state are X and
 
00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
there are this many land owners engaged
 
00:29:45.669 --> 00:29:45.679 align:start position:0%
in carbon credit programs again it's
 
00:29:47.789 --> 00:29:47.799 align:start position:0%
about getting meaningful information
 
00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
this is what the original sponsors of
 
00:29:50.789 --> 00:29:50.799 align:start position:0%
this bill were looking for is like they
 
00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
don't know who's involved in carbon
 
00:29:54.149 --> 00:29:54.159 align:start position:0%
credits they don't know how many acres
 
00:29:56.029 --> 00:29:56.039 align:start position:0%
are involved how is this going to impact
 
00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
their Timber tax revenue
 
00:30:00.789 --> 00:30:00.799 align:start position:0%
so let's make sure it's as helpful as
 
00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
possible agreed so section two of the
 
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:28.110 align:start position:0%
 
227-4481

00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:28.120 align:start position:0%
227-4481
 
00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:31.240 align:start position:0%
does this give you enough legal
 
00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
authority to create a
 
00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:38.320 align:start position:0%
rule to notify land owners that they
 
00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:48.549 --> 00:30:48.559 align:start position:0%
this I think it does um thank you for
 
00:30:52.269 --> 00:30:52.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
um I would want to check with my staff
 
00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:56.600 align:start position:0%
right now as far as you know we weren't
 
00:30:58.549 --> 00:30:58.559 align:start position:0%
around when they tent to cut law was put
 
00:30:59.870 --> 00:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
into play so I'm not sure how they
 
00:31:02.269 --> 00:31:02.279 align:start position:0%
actually got that word out but I think
 
00:31:05.549 --> 00:31:05.559 align:start position:0%
we can work with um the stakeholders in
 
00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
this and maybe the New Hampshire
 
00:31:09.509 --> 00:31:09.519 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association to um get that
 
00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
word out that this is a new requirement
 
00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:15.240 align:start position:0%
of Timberland owners okay
 
00:31:18.509 --> 00:31:18.519 align:start position:0%
good representative muns uh thanks Mr
 
00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
chairman if I could ask a follow-up
 
00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:22.389 align:start position:0%
chairman if I could ask a follow-up
question

00:31:22.389 --> 00:31:22.399 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
um do you do you feel that you need to
 
00:31:29.509 --> 00:31:29.519 align:start position:0%
have that there needs to be some penalty
 
00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:31.320 align:start position:0%
for non-compliance
 
00:31:35.549 --> 00:31:35.559 align:start position:0%
provision and if so do you have the
 
00:31:37.549 --> 00:31:37.559 align:start position:0%
statutory authority to do that through
 
00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
Ru making or do you need us to put
 
00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:41.000 align:start position:0%
something in there that specifically
 
00:31:44.629 --> 00:31:44.639 align:start position:0%
says what that penalty would
 
00:31:47.629 --> 00:31:47.639 align:start position:0%
be so I'm still new to the uh
 
00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:49.960 align:start position:0%
legislative process here but I would
 
00:31:52.789 --> 00:31:52.799 align:start position:0%
think that you would need to have some
 
00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:55.480 align:start position:0%
some teeth in the law to enable rulle
 
00:31:57.789 --> 00:31:57.799 align:start position:0%
making to have a penalty I don't I don't
 
00:31:59.350 --> 00:31:59.360 align:start position:0%
know that for sure I would defer to all
 
00:32:02.029 --> 00:32:02.039 align:start position:0%
of you but
 
00:32:05.389 --> 00:32:05.399 align:start position:0%
um uh whatever the the penalty we have
 
00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
in the current RSA 79a the timber tax
 
00:32:11.909 --> 00:32:11.919 align:start position:0%
law if whatever that penalty is maybe we
 
00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:16.760 align:start position:0%
can emulate that but um this is just a
 
00:32:18.549 --> 00:32:18.559 align:start position:0%
reporting requirement it's not a tax
 
00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:20.240 align:start position:0%
collecting document like the intent to
 
00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
cut form is is all about taxes so I
 
00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
would think we wouldn't need to make it
 
00:32:29.389 --> 00:32:29.399 align:start position:0%
an orous penalty but I think we you know
 
00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
if we're going to do this we should put
 
00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:33.080 align:start position:0%
some teeth in in the enforcement aspect
 
00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
whether that's in the body of the law or
 
00:32:39.909 --> 00:32:39.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:44.110 --> 00:32:44.120 align:start position:0%
say I'd be reluctant to put any
 
00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:46.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement mechanism in here beyond
 
00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
what the agency thinks they can do via
 
00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:50.149 align:start position:0%
what the agency thinks they can do via
Ru

00:32:50.149 --> 00:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
Ru
 
00:32:55.549 --> 00:32:55.559 align:start position:0%
making paragraph B on line 26 says that
 
00:32:57.549 --> 00:32:57.559 align:start position:0%
the landowner shall no ify the
 
00:32:59.549 --> 00:32:59.559 align:start position:0%
municipality or municipalities where the
 
00:33:01.149 --> 00:33:01.159 align:start position:0%
subject land is
 
00:33:04.509 --> 00:33:04.519 align:start position:0%
located and once they understand that
 
00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to do that I think most
 
00:33:09.909 --> 00:33:09.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
would further discussion representative
 
00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
Thomas yes um thank you
 
00:33:20.669 --> 00:33:20.679 align:start position:0%
um so there's been um I'm sorry there's
 
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
been a discussion about an annual report
 
00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
um which I think is a great idea if
 
00:33:27.389 --> 00:33:27.399 align:start position:0%
we're going to collect this information
 
00:33:31.029 --> 00:33:31.039 align:start position:0%
then then let's publish it somewhere um
 
00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:33.240 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the annual report however
 
00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:35.320 align:start position:0%
is just to collect the information or is
 
00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:38.840 align:start position:0%
it to somehow suggest a change because
 
00:33:44.149 --> 00:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:47.000 align:start position:0%
go I don't think there is an annual
 
00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
report required based on this no that
 
00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
was a suggestion from from the the
 
00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:56.440 align:start position:0%
speaker that was a suggestion I made
 
00:33:57.710 --> 00:33:57.720 align:start position:0%
just so that that it can be used by
 
00:34:00.549 --> 00:34:00.559 align:start position:0%
policy makers or uh members of the the
 
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
forest products industry and Community
 
00:34:05.629 --> 00:34:05.639 align:start position:0%
um again if we're trying to track a
 
00:34:08.190 --> 00:34:08.200 align:start position:0%
trend that's just um something that
 
00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:10.240 align:start position:0%
would be easily quantifiable at the end
 
00:34:11.069 --> 00:34:11.079 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
year but it's it's not something I'm
 
00:34:16.909 --> 00:34:16.919 align:start position:0%
gonna I'm gon to die on that Hill
 
00:34:19.669 --> 00:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
for I have I have a followup if we do
 
00:34:21.829 --> 00:34:21.839 align:start position:0%
include it in I'm sorry if we do include
 
00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
an annual report does that now um does
 
00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:26.200 align:start position:0%
this now need a fiscal note because of
 
00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:27.510 align:start position:0%
this now need a fiscal note because of
that

00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:29.560 align:start position:0%
it might yeah
 
00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:33.200 align:start position:0%
um so thank you that yes I would suggest
 
00:34:36.589 --> 00:34:36.599 align:start position:0%
that if this information is publicly
 
00:34:39.349 --> 00:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
available anybody can go get
 
00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
it so we don't really need to file a
 
00:34:45.909 --> 00:34:45.919 align:start position:0%
report let's see how this works out for
 
00:34:46.990 --> 00:34:47.000 align:start position:0%
a year or
 
00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
two if if it turns out to be a really
 
00:34:53.950 --> 00:34:53.960 align:start position:0%
big deal and it needs a lot more
 
00:34:56.349 --> 00:34:56.359 align:start position:0%
bureaucratic support then maybe we'll
 
00:34:57.510 --> 00:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
pass some
 
00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
new legislation to support it later but
 
00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
I think this is a good place to start
 
00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:06.760 align:start position:0%
get this thing going and see it see if
 
00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:09.440 align:start position:0%
it's useful if it's not useful we might
 
00:35:12.349 --> 00:35:12.359 align:start position:0%
scrap it all together
 
00:35:14.910 --> 00:35:14.920 align:start position:0%
but it's important to get something
 
00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:17.720 align:start position:0%
started today I think or as quickly as
 
00:35:20.589 --> 00:35:20.599 align:start position:0%
possible so that we can start down the
 
00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:24.200 align:start position:0%
road to figuring out how to handle this
 
00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:26.920 align:start position:0%
situation Vice chair Thomas thank you Mr
 
00:35:29.390 --> 00:35:29.400 align:start position:0%
chair uh actually I was just about to
 
00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
say the same words as you did because
 
00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:34.680 align:start position:0%
this bill is too important to the timber
 
00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
indry particularly in the North country
 
00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:39.720 align:start position:0%
but all over the state to let uh you
 
00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
know perfect be the enemy of the good
 
00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
and so I think to your point uh this
 
00:35:49.390 --> 00:35:49.400 align:start position:0%
amendment looks like it's good enough to
 
00:35:52.109 --> 00:35:52.119 align:start position:0%
get passed I have no doubt that our
 
00:35:54.069 --> 00:35:54.079 align:start position:0%
friends on the other side of the wall
 
00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
will make some comments when once they
 
00:35:59.069 --> 00:35:59.079 align:start position:0%
get it and in the end we'll we'll come
 
00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
up with a uh a statute that uh can is
 
00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:06.440 align:start position:0%
workable and to your point uh maybe in a
 
00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
year or two when things settle down uh
 
00:36:10.589 --> 00:36:10.599 align:start position:0%
there'll be some adjustments but for
 
00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:12.760 align:start position:0%
right now I think it's too important not
 
00:36:15.349 --> 00:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
get going uh to to to just get this on
 
00:36:18.349 --> 00:36:18.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
board all right so let's have a show of
 
00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
hand of Representative McGee oh thank
 
00:36:24.670 --> 00:36:24.680 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I just it's just one little
 
00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
knit um we had discussed
 
00:36:30.829 --> 00:36:30.839 align:start position:0%
adding enrolled in carbon credits um
 
00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:33.400 align:start position:0%
under number six acreage of subject land
 
00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:35.430 align:start position:0%
under number six acreage of subject land
but

00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:35.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
um it it looks like number three above
 
00:36:42.349 --> 00:36:42.359 align:start position:0%
uh where it's listing uh it says the
 
00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
name of the program the program registry
 
00:36:46.990 --> 00:36:47.000 align:start position:0%
or Registries under which the subject
 
00:36:49.870 --> 00:36:49.880 align:start position:0%
land is enrolled so I think it's already
 
00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:51.640 align:start position:0%
covered in the language and of course Mr
 
00:36:54.109 --> 00:36:54.119 align:start position:0%
Hackley didn't have the copy at the time
 
00:36:55.470 --> 00:36:55.480 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure we need to add any
 
00:36:57.589 --> 00:36:57.599 align:start position:0%
language there I think I think it's
 
00:36:57.599 --> 00:36:58.589 align:start position:0%
language there I think I think it's
already

00:36:58.589 --> 00:36:58.599 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:37:00.670 --> 00:37:00.680 align:start position:0%
covered thank you I'm glad you caught
 
00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:03.640 align:start position:0%
that and I agree it is already
 
00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
covered so do we need any further
 
00:37:08.069 --> 00:37:08.079 align:start position:0%
discussion of this
 
00:37:10.309 --> 00:37:10.319 align:start position:0%
amendment let's have a show of hands of
 
00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
amendment okay that's
 
00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:27.880 align:start position:0%
then next up will be House Bill H B
 
00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
1078 relative to first responder
 
00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:34.880 align:start position:0%
organization access to wireless tower
 
00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:38.680 align:start position:0%
collocation Mr chairman my mistake
 
00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
actually we're going to deal with House
 
00:37:44.349 --> 00:37:44.359 align:start position:0%
Bill 1472 first relative to rebates of
 
00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency funds for electric
 
00:37:49.829 --> 00:37:49.839 align:start position:0%
vehicles because there are parties here
 
00:37:52.349 --> 00:37:52.359 align:start position:0%
who would like to hear our discussion
 
00:37:54.990 --> 00:37:55.000 align:start position:0%
but who have to leave so we will we will
 
00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
do this one next
 
00:37:59.109 --> 00:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
and I will open things up to
 
00:37:59.119 --> 00:38:00.750 align:start position:0%
and I will open things up to
representative

00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:00.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:38:06.069 --> 00:38:06.079 align:start position:0%
muns thank you Mr chairman um and um you
 
00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
know you should have an amendment that I
 
00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
um circulated um last week it's uh
 
00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:16.109 align:start position:0%
um circulated um last week it's uh
20243

00:38:16.109 --> 00:38:16.119 align:start position:0%
20243
 
00:38:20.069 --> 00:38:20.079 align:start position:0%
42h um what the amendment is attempting
 
00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
to do is provide a little bit more
 
00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
specificity uh as to what the intent of
 
00:38:31.470 --> 00:38:31.480 align:start position:0%
the original bill was um during
 
00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:35.640 align:start position:0%
testimony on the bill we um we heard
 
00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
testimony and there were some questions
 
00:38:40.349 --> 00:38:40.359 align:start position:0%
from members of the committee that it
 
00:38:42.309 --> 00:38:42.319 align:start position:0%
might that it would be worthwhile to
 
00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:45.280 align:start position:0%
have some guidelines and guard rails
 
00:38:47.589 --> 00:38:47.599 align:start position:0%
around the program so that we were we
 
00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:49.480 align:start position:0%
knew exactly what we would be doing if
 
00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:52.200 align:start position:0%
this program was enacted and that's what
 
00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:56.240 align:start position:0%
this amendment attempts to do um it uh
 
00:38:59.230 --> 00:38:59.240 align:start position:0%
CL clarifies that we're talking about a
 
00:39:02.270 --> 00:39:02.280 align:start position:0%
million5 dollar a year that would be
 
00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
transferred um from the um the the the
 
00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
the Reggie funds uh to support um a
 
00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
program um each year for the next two
 
00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:20.280 align:start position:0%
years um uh it also specifies that the
 
00:39:25.950 --> 00:39:25.960 align:start position:0%
um that the rebate program would um be
 
00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
that would apply to um electric vehicles
 
00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:32.920 align:start position:0%
and plug-in hybrid
 
00:39:36.829 --> 00:39:36.839 align:start position:0%
vehicles um up to $80,000 for a pickup
 
00:39:40.109 --> 00:39:40.119 align:start position:0%
truck and up to $50,000 for all eligible
 
00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
Vehicles it would include new and used
 
00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
vehicles um the incentive for battery
 
00:39:49.829 --> 00:39:49.839 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles would be $2,000 a
 
00:39:51.870 --> 00:39:51.880 align:start position:0%
one-time payment of $2,000 and for
 
00:39:53.950 --> 00:39:53.960 align:start position:0%
plugins it would be
 
00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
$1,000 and to be eligible for the
 
00:39:57.950 --> 00:39:57.960 align:start position:0%
program you would need to be a New
 
00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire resident at least 18 years of
 
00:40:03.589 --> 00:40:03.599 align:start position:0%
age um with a valid New Hampshire
 
00:40:03.599 --> 00:40:04.589 align:start position:0%
age um with a valid New Hampshire
driver's

00:40:04.589 --> 00:40:04.599 align:start position:0%
driver's
 
00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
license um and the program would be set
 
00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:11.480 align:start position:0%
up and and there are Income Limits um on
 
00:40:13.829 --> 00:40:13.839 align:start position:0%
what the participant can make that are
 
00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:15.200 align:start position:0%
consistent with what the federal
 
00:40:17.950 --> 00:40:17.960 align:start position:0%
program's limits are and the program
 
00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:22.640 align:start position:0%
would be set up in such a way that um a
 
00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
participant could take the rebate
 
00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
themselves or transfer it
 
00:40:29.589 --> 00:40:29.599 align:start position:0%
to um the dealer and then the dealer
 
00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
could take the price off of the um the
 
00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
retail price of the uh the
 
00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:36.069 align:start position:0%
retail price of the uh the
vehicle

00:40:36.069 --> 00:40:36.079 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:42.760 align:start position:0%
um you know the the the money for this
 
00:40:45.829 --> 00:40:45.839 align:start position:0%
would come from Reggie funds that are
 
00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:49.640 align:start position:0%
currently being allocated towards
 
00:40:53.550 --> 00:40:53.560 align:start position:0%
um a reduction in the El electric rates
 
00:40:55.829 --> 00:40:55.839 align:start position:0%
for people and I know that's a concern
 
00:40:58.230 --> 00:40:58.240 align:start position:0%
of um some members of the
 
00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:03.240 align:start position:0%
committee um and I I did some math and
 
00:41:07.150 --> 00:41:07.160 align:start position:0%
it looks like the the annual impact on a
 
00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:09.560 align:start position:0%
customer would of this program by
 
00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:11.160 align:start position:0%
diverting a million and a half dollars
 
00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:14.200 align:start position:0%
would be about $2 per customer per
 
00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:18.040 align:start position:0%
year um it's important to remember that
 
00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:20.680 align:start position:0%
the money that would be used for this
 
00:41:23.349 --> 00:41:23.359 align:start position:0%
program would still go to New Hampshire
 
00:41:25.589 --> 00:41:25.599 align:start position:0%
residents um only New Hampshire
 
00:41:25.599 --> 00:41:27.510 align:start position:0%
residents um only New Hampshire
residents

00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
residents
 
00:41:32.069 --> 00:41:32.079 align:start position:0%
um and um this program has the support
 
00:41:33.829 --> 00:41:33.839 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire Auto Dealers
 
00:41:35.349 --> 00:41:35.359 align:start position:0%
Association and it's the thing that
 
00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
they've been asking for and it would um
 
00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
help to um uh stimulate sales of
 
00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles in New Hampshire
 
00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:48.280 align:start position:0%
benefiting our local businesses and also
 
00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:51.160 align:start position:0%
um you know we continue to struggle with
 
00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
the um chicken in the egg issue
 
00:41:58.430 --> 00:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
of um you know Chargers versus vehicles
 
00:42:01.870 --> 00:42:01.880 align:start position:0%
and um by hopefully increasing the
 
00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:04.960 align:start position:0%
number of vehicles on the road um this
 
00:42:07.950 --> 00:42:07.960 align:start position:0%
will um you know stimulate the demand
 
00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:10.760 align:start position:0%
for additional charging stations which
 
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
will then hopefully stimulate demand for
 
00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
more um Vehicles so um I think it's a
 
00:42:20.829 --> 00:42:20.839 align:start position:0%
it's a good small investment in um our
 
00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:24.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire economy and um hoping that
 
00:42:25.829 --> 00:42:25.839 align:start position:0%
uh people in the committee can support
 
00:42:25.839 --> 00:42:28.870 align:start position:0%
uh people in the committee can support
the

00:42:28.870 --> 00:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:32.109 --> 00:42:32.119 align:start position:0%
additional comments representative
 
00:42:35.549 --> 00:42:35.559 align:start position:0%
Kennedy uh thank you Mr chairman uh my
 
00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
comments are more kind of on a policy
 
00:42:41.790 --> 00:42:41.800 align:start position:0%
level the electrical vehicle tax credit
 
00:42:43.349 --> 00:42:43.359 align:start position:0%
was first introduced as part of the
 
00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:45.480 align:start position:0%
energy Policy Act of
 
00:42:48.069 --> 00:42:48.079 align:start position:0%
2005 as a way to encourage the
 
00:42:51.150 --> 00:42:51.160 align:start position:0%
production and Adoption of electric
 
00:42:54.430 --> 00:42:54.440 align:start position:0%
vehicles in 2009 the American Recovery
 
00:42:57.270 --> 00:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
and reinvestment act expanded the credit
 
00:42:59.549 --> 00:42:59.559 align:start position:0%
to include plug-in electric vehicles and
 
00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
$7,500 my question is how long do we
 
00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
need to keep encouraging them we have
 
00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
been doing this for 14
 
00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:14.720 align:start position:0%
years the richest man in the world sells
 
00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
EVS does he really need more
 
00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
help at this point what these programs
 
00:43:22.349 --> 00:43:22.359 align:start position:0%
accomplish in my
 
00:43:24.589 --> 00:43:24.599 align:start position:0%
opinion is to take money from the
 
00:43:27.549 --> 00:43:27.559 align:start position:0%
person's stocking shells at home Depot
 
00:43:29.309 --> 00:43:29.319 align:start position:0%
and give it to some well-paid
 
00:43:31.549 --> 00:43:31.559 align:start position:0%
professional so that he can boast to his
 
00:43:34.390 --> 00:43:34.400 align:start position:0%
friends that he is saving the Earth and
 
00:43:36.109 --> 00:43:36.119 align:start position:0%
I think that's
 
00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
wrong further discussion representative
 
00:43:42.829 --> 00:43:42.839 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you um I would like to ask
 
00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
of the Amendments author um is this
 
00:43:48.069 --> 00:43:48.079 align:start position:0%
rebate program like the NH saves when it
 
00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:50.480 align:start position:0%
runs out of money it runs out of
 
00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:54.040 align:start position:0%
money yes there's a cap of $1.5 million
 
00:43:56.829 --> 00:43:56.839 align:start position:0%
per year and this is just a pilot
 
00:43:58.990 --> 00:43:59.000 align:start position:0%
program yeah thank
 
00:44:01.549 --> 00:44:01.559 align:start position:0%
you further discussion representative
 
00:44:05.069 --> 00:44:05.079 align:start position:0%
lii uh thank you Mr chairman um like
 
00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
many things I think that if voluntary
 
00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:11.680 align:start position:0%
would be better than mandatory and why
 
00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
not if we are to do it to have poor Paul
 
00:44:16.510 --> 00:44:16.520 align:start position:0%
who's paying the bill be able to check
 
00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
off on his electric bill that he wants
 
00:44:20.470 --> 00:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
to contribute to a fund rather than uh
 
00:44:24.430 --> 00:44:24.440 align:start position:0%
making every making all the uh stalkers
 
00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:28.200 align:start position:0%
at U Home Depot pay for um rich
 
00:44:30.190 --> 00:44:30.200 align:start position:0%
people further
 
00:44:34.150 --> 00:44:34.160 align:start position:0%
discussion representative McGee thank
 
00:44:38.589 --> 00:44:38.599 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um my comment my thought is
 
00:44:40.829 --> 00:44:40.839 align:start position:0%
that uh I think since I've been on the
 
00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
committee uh this my third term we have
 
00:44:47.150 --> 00:44:47.160 align:start position:0%
had uh many bills and many proposals to
 
00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
try and take the money that the state
 
00:44:51.150 --> 00:44:51.160 align:start position:0%
receives from the regional greenhouse
 
00:44:54.910 --> 00:44:54.920 align:start position:0%
gas Initiative Program and figure out uh
 
00:44:57.710 --> 00:44:57.720 align:start position:0%
ways to help lower our emissions
 
00:45:00.910 --> 00:45:00.920 align:start position:0%
basically uh do something that helps uh
 
00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
on the carbon side and that is the
 
00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
intent of that program and yet we are
 
00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
the only state that still diverts a
 
00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:10.720 align:start position:0%
majority of the money to rebates and I
 
00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:12.040 align:start position:0%
think that's a decision of the
 
00:45:16.390 --> 00:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
legislature but I think um I think where
 
00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
this bill is coming from in in my
 
00:45:20.270 --> 00:45:20.280 align:start position:0%
understanding from talking with the
 
00:45:24.349 --> 00:45:24.359 align:start position:0%
original Bill sponsor is that we are
 
00:45:27.829 --> 00:45:27.839 align:start position:0%
looking to try and use that money for a
 
00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
bit of an economy of scale to do
 
00:45:31.790 --> 00:45:31.800 align:start position:0%
something a little larger it's the same
 
00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
thing with the new New Hampshire saves
 
00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:36.160 align:start position:0%
program which is the only program you
 
00:45:37.790 --> 00:45:37.800 align:start position:0%
know the Energy Efficiency fund is the
 
00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
only program that we have authorized and
 
00:45:42.750 --> 00:45:42.760 align:start position:0%
we've received information over the
 
00:45:45.030 --> 00:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
years that because of those Investments
 
00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:48.760 align:start position:0%
we've been able to stabilize our demand
 
00:45:51.109 --> 00:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
um because we're doing demand side
 
00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
demand side investment um so it's really
 
00:45:56.190 --> 00:45:56.200 align:start position:0%
a question of what we're getting getting
 
00:45:58.549 --> 00:45:58.559 align:start position:0%
back for what is a relatively small
 
00:46:02.270 --> 00:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
investment and also it it is assisting
 
00:46:04.910 --> 00:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
you know the Dealers Association uh to
 
00:46:06.549 --> 00:46:06.559 align:start position:0%
remain competitive because at this point
 
00:46:09.309 --> 00:46:09.319 align:start position:0%
if people are interested in test driving
 
00:46:12.549 --> 00:46:12.559 align:start position:0%
or um you know having access to seeing
 
00:46:14.510 --> 00:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
what it would like be like to have an
 
00:46:15.870 --> 00:46:15.880 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle people are going to
 
00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
other states uh to to have those test
 
00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:20.280 align:start position:0%
drives and they they don't have an easy
 
00:46:22.750 --> 00:46:22.760 align:start position:0%
time finding electric vehicles here so I
 
00:46:26.109 --> 00:46:26.119 align:start position:0%
think this program would be able to help
 
00:46:30.349 --> 00:46:30.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:33.710 --> 00:46:33.720 align:start position:0%
transition thank you representative
 
00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
Harrington thank you Mr Speaker well
 
00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:38.240 align:start position:0%
first I'd like to say it certainly is no
 
00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:40.720 align:start position:0%
shock that the automobil uh deals
 
00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:42.640 align:start position:0%
Association is in favor of this I mean
 
00:46:44.349 --> 00:46:44.359 align:start position:0%
what business wouldn't be if you're
 
00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:45.880 align:start position:0%
going to come out and say we're going to
 
00:46:47.870 --> 00:46:47.880 align:start position:0%
give $1,000 to your customers in order
 
00:46:50.030 --> 00:46:50.040 align:start position:0%
to buy your product well you know be
 
00:46:51.549 --> 00:46:51.559 align:start position:0%
have to be an idiot not to be in favor
 
00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
of that but we also must remember where
 
00:46:56.270 --> 00:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
this money comes from it's we talk about
 
00:46:58.430 --> 00:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
Reggie money being returned this is
 
00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
money that the rate payers pay they're
 
00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
charged every penny of the Reggie money
 
00:47:04.910 --> 00:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
comes from rate payers then in some
 
00:47:06.430 --> 00:47:06.440 align:start position:0%
states they use it on different programs
 
00:47:08.309 --> 00:47:08.319 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire most of it's rebated
 
00:47:10.510 --> 00:47:10.520 align:start position:0%
back to the rate payers to defer it we
 
00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:12.720 align:start position:0%
always talk about electric bills but
 
00:47:14.069 --> 00:47:14.079 align:start position:0%
every time something like this comes up
 
00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
it's only $2 or of this or it's only $4
 
00:47:19.230 --> 00:47:19.240 align:start position:0%
whatever but you know eventually all
 
00:47:22.270 --> 00:47:22.280 align:start position:0%
these things tend to add up I refer to
 
00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:24.280 align:start position:0%
this type of Bill as a reverse Robin
 
00:47:26.710 --> 00:47:26.720 align:start position:0%
Hood bill because you have someone out
 
00:47:28.349 --> 00:47:28.359 align:start position:0%
there that's making $60
 
00:47:30.829 --> 00:47:30.839 align:start position:0%
$70,000 which is around the the medium
 
00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
income I think 75,000 in New Hampshire
 
00:47:36.109 --> 00:47:36.119 align:start position:0%
they're not buying a electric vehicle
 
00:47:38.109 --> 00:47:38.119 align:start position:0%
even with $1,000 CU they can't afford to
 
00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
go out and spend $440,000 for a car so
 
00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
that doesn't make any difference to them
 
00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:44.640 align:start position:0%
but on the other hand if you have a a
 
00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
married couple that are making jointly
 
00:47:49.829 --> 00:47:49.839 align:start position:0%
$290,000 they're going to get $2,000
 
00:47:52.150 --> 00:47:52.160 align:start position:0%
towards their nice new electric pickup
 
00:47:55.270 --> 00:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
truck uh this is simply taking from the
 
00:47:56.950 --> 00:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
people that don't have and given to the
 
00:47:59.510 --> 00:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
people that have it's not a m matter of
 
00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
everybody can take advantage of this
 
00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
because like I said a huge portion of
 
00:48:05.829 --> 00:48:05.839 align:start position:0%
our population will not be able to
 
00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
afford electric vehicle even with a
 
00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
$1,000 R uh
 
00:48:13.230 --> 00:48:13.240 align:start position:0%
rebate representative parshall has a qu
 
00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:14.829 align:start position:0%
rebate representative parshall has a qu
a

00:48:14.829 --> 00:48:14.839 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:48:18.190 --> 00:48:18.200 align:start position:0%
comment thank you chair I'm starting to
 
00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:21.800 align:start position:0%
resent the uh um characterization of uh
 
00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
this is being a giveaway to the rich I
 
00:48:25.870 --> 00:48:25.880 align:start position:0%
this purchased my second elect El
 
00:48:27.589 --> 00:48:27.599 align:start position:0%
vehicle and a big motivator in that
 
00:48:29.910 --> 00:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
purchase was the fact that I did get a
 
00:48:32.430 --> 00:48:32.440 align:start position:0%
federal rebate on that purchase the
 
00:48:35.069 --> 00:48:35.079 align:start position:0%
purchase itself was under
 
00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
$155,000 it's going to save me
 
00:48:39.910 --> 00:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
significant money in my gas at at the
 
00:48:42.270 --> 00:48:42.280 align:start position:0%
pump and it's going to hopefully if we
 
00:48:43.470 --> 00:48:43.480 align:start position:0%
believe in the free enterprise system
 
00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
it's going to drive the price of
 
00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:46.030 align:start position:0%
it's going to drive the price of
gasoline

00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:46.040 align:start position:0%
gasoline
 
00:48:48.589 --> 00:48:48.599 align:start position:0%
down and to be characterized this as a
 
00:48:51.349 --> 00:48:51.359 align:start position:0%
giveaway to the rich is an extremely
 
00:48:54.589 --> 00:48:54.599 align:start position:0%
offensive characterization of this
 
00:48:58.390 --> 00:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
bill representative Corman thank you Mr
 
00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
chairman uh to representative parshall's
 
00:49:03.870 --> 00:49:03.880 align:start position:0%
comments I would also uh remind everyone
 
00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
that this uh rebate would apply to used
 
00:49:08.950 --> 00:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
EVS as long as they're bought through a
 
00:49:11.230 --> 00:49:11.240 align:start position:0%
dealer so you're going to be see seeing
 
00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:14.240 align:start position:0%
lower prices on those Vehicles so it's
 
00:49:17.349 --> 00:49:17.359 align:start position:0%
not really entirely for the rich uh and
 
00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
also to address some of the other
 
00:49:21.789 --> 00:49:21.799 align:start position:0%
comments we're in this point of
 
00:49:24.630 --> 00:49:24.640 align:start position:0%
technological change and technological
 
00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:28.720 align:start position:0%
change is rarely easy when we started
 
00:49:32.829 --> 00:49:32.839 align:start position:0%
replacing horses with
 
00:49:34.870 --> 00:49:34.880 align:start position:0%
automobiles not everybody could afford
 
00:49:37.349 --> 00:49:37.359 align:start position:0%
an automobile and gasoline was hard to
 
00:49:39.870 --> 00:49:39.880 align:start position:0%
come by you had to go to to a pharmacy
 
00:49:43.510 --> 00:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
and buy it by the pint or court so we're
 
00:49:45.950 --> 00:49:45.960 align:start position:0%
in that sort of situation now and the
 
00:49:48.589 --> 00:49:48.599 align:start position:0%
question is do we want to promote that
 
00:49:51.710 --> 00:49:51.720 align:start position:0%
sort of change or do we want to stifle
 
00:49:54.789 --> 00:49:54.799 align:start position:0%
it Vice chair Thomas has a comment thank
 
00:49:57.109 --> 00:49:57.119 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair uh respectfully I would
 
00:49:59.750 --> 00:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
like to remind uh representative Corman
 
00:50:04.349 --> 00:50:04.359 align:start position:0%
that the example cited uh it was true
 
00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
but it was Private Industry that was
 
00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
able to get people to finally get more
 
00:50:13.549 --> 00:50:13.559 align:start position:0%
gas out there uh and to sell more of
 
00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
their gas powered vehicles it wasn't any
 
00:50:19.349 --> 00:50:19.359 align:start position:0%
legislative subsidy or mandates and to
 
00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
this point here I I know they were
 
00:50:22.910 --> 00:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
private Industries they big private
 
00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
Industries they spent a lot of money
 
00:50:25.589 --> 00:50:25.599 align:start position:0%
doing that setting up their own gas
 
00:50:27.789 --> 00:50:27.799 align:start position:0%
stations but I think to this point here
 
00:50:31.309 --> 00:50:31.319 align:start position:0%
is is that U I firmly believe let the
 
00:50:34.510 --> 00:50:34.520 align:start position:0%
market decide let just let the market
 
00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
decide if people want and can afford a
 
00:50:41.109 --> 00:50:41.119 align:start position:0%
vehicle they will buy it and so uh and
 
00:50:42.990 --> 00:50:43.000 align:start position:0%
that's where I think we are particularly
 
00:50:44.309 --> 00:50:44.319 align:start position:0%
to have people that are paying electric
 
00:50:46.870 --> 00:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
bills to pay for people to buy electric
 
00:50:48.270 --> 00:50:48.280 align:start position:0%
vehicles I don't think is the right
 
00:50:51.390 --> 00:50:51.400 align:start position:0%
vehicle anyway so it's my point on
 
00:50:53.870 --> 00:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
00:50:56.309 --> 00:50:56.319 align:start position:0%
rolds thank you Mr chairman yes I just
 
00:50:57.829 --> 00:50:57.839 align:start position:0%
wanted to
 
00:51:03.829 --> 00:51:03.839 align:start position:0%
um I guess uh join in um support um my
 
00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:05.400 align:start position:0%
colleague representative parshall's
 
00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:09.240 align:start position:0%
remarks and you know push back on the
 
00:51:11.430 --> 00:51:11.440 align:start position:0%
characterization that this would be uh
 
00:51:14.589 --> 00:51:14.599 align:start position:0%
just a subsidy for the rich um while
 
00:51:17.109 --> 00:51:17.119 align:start position:0%
it's true
 
00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
that uh some models of electric vehicles
 
00:51:23.789 --> 00:51:23.799 align:start position:0%
you know your Teslas your rivan are on
 
00:51:26.510 --> 00:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
the expensive side there's also Al the
 
00:51:28.990 --> 00:51:29.000 align:start position:0%
Chevy bolt which is the bestselling e
 
00:51:32.510 --> 00:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
and which is a very low priced uh you
 
00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
know little four-door hatchback um
 
00:51:38.549 --> 00:51:38.559 align:start position:0%
that's very accessible to U A lot of
 
00:51:42.589 --> 00:51:42.599 align:start position:0%
people and I would like to point out
 
00:51:45.870 --> 00:51:45.880 align:start position:0%
that the focus on the sticker price is
 
00:51:51.789 --> 00:51:51.799 align:start position:0%
also misplaced um while and and in fact
 
00:51:55.549 --> 00:51:55.559 align:start position:0%
the the policy instrument of the rebate
 
00:51:58.190 --> 00:51:58.200 align:start position:0%
uh The Upfront you know uh first cost
 
00:52:01.589 --> 00:52:01.599 align:start position:0%
rebate is is well established the cost
 
00:52:04.710 --> 00:52:04.720 align:start position:0%
advantage of electric vehicles is in
 
00:52:07.309 --> 00:52:07.319 align:start position:0%
their ownership ownership costs they
 
00:52:10.510 --> 00:52:10.520 align:start position:0%
have much lower cost of fuel and
 
00:52:12.549 --> 00:52:12.559 align:start position:0%
maintenance and
 
00:52:12.559 --> 00:52:14.270 align:start position:0%
maintenance and
so

00:52:14.270 --> 00:52:14.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
um folks on the lower end of the
 
00:52:20.829 --> 00:52:20.839 align:start position:0%
income you know wealth
 
00:52:20.839 --> 00:52:22.910 align:start position:0%
income you know wealth
Spectrum

00:52:22.910 --> 00:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
Spectrum
 
00:52:25.670 --> 00:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
um well it's true that they might have a
 
00:52:28.430 --> 00:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
hard time affording the first cost of an
 
00:52:32.069 --> 00:52:32.079 align:start position:0%
EV if they can if they can get
 
00:52:35.990 --> 00:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
one um they'll have a much easier time
 
00:52:38.349 --> 00:52:38.359 align:start position:0%
with uh with the ownership costs and so
 
00:52:41.470 --> 00:52:41.480 align:start position:0%
that's that's why the rebate um that's
 
00:52:42.910 --> 00:52:42.920 align:start position:0%
you know a premise of New Hampshire
 
00:52:46.069 --> 00:52:46.079 align:start position:0%
saves is you you give people a incentive
 
00:52:48.270 --> 00:52:48.280 align:start position:0%
to buy this more
 
00:52:51.870 --> 00:52:51.880 align:start position:0%
efficient energy using item so that they
 
00:52:55.230 --> 00:52:55.240 align:start position:0%
can have lifetime cost savings and so SU
 
00:52:58.069 --> 00:52:58.079 align:start position:0%
Society can have lifetime pollution
 
00:53:01.030 --> 00:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
savings from the Efficient Electric
 
00:53:03.470 --> 00:53:03.480 align:start position:0%
Vehicle so that's where we're try we're
 
00:53:08.309 --> 00:53:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
this representative uh
 
00:53:16.549 --> 00:53:16.559 align:start position:0%
Harrington um just a a quick search here
 
00:53:19.309 --> 00:53:19.319 align:start position:0%
um higher income households earning over
 
00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:22.480 align:start position:0%
$100,000 a year account for 56% of EV
 
00:53:25.190 --> 00:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
owners only 4% of EV owners have a house
 
00:53:27.829 --> 00:53:27.839 align:start position:0%
so income under 25,000 so again the
 
00:53:29.950 --> 00:53:29.960 align:start position:0%
people making under 25,000 are still
 
00:53:31.270 --> 00:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
paying electric bills so they're
 
00:53:33.030 --> 00:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
subsidizing the rich people if you look
 
00:53:34.670 --> 00:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
at some other statistics on this was
 
00:53:36.789 --> 00:53:36.799 align:start position:0%
2021 there was a later one for
 
00:53:39.109 --> 00:53:39.119 align:start position:0%
California that said the average income
 
00:53:41.109 --> 00:53:41.119 align:start position:0%
of uh EV owners was over
 
00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
$150,000 so to think that this is going
 
00:53:47.069 --> 00:53:47.079 align:start position:0%
to be you know the the poor lower inome
 
00:53:48.069 --> 00:53:48.079 align:start position:0%
people they're just not going to be able
 
00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
to take advantage of this they're just
 
00:53:51.030 --> 00:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
going to see the
 
00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
bill representative McGee thank you Mr
 
00:53:57.069 --> 00:53:57.079 align:start position:0%
chair um um I would like to go back to
 
00:54:01.589 --> 00:54:01.599 align:start position:0%
Reggie for a moment because um in the
 
00:54:03.109 --> 00:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
reports that I've seen over the years
 
00:54:04.789 --> 00:54:04.799 align:start position:0%
and in the data that I've looked at in
 
00:54:06.190 --> 00:54:06.200 align:start position:0%
terms of the amount of income that's
 
00:54:07.750 --> 00:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
been going to us and the other states
 
00:54:11.109 --> 00:54:11.119 align:start position:0%
that are participating in the region um
 
00:54:13.270 --> 00:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
that money it's a cap and trade program
 
00:54:15.950 --> 00:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
designed to give us economies of scale
 
00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
by providing money through the sale of
 
00:54:23.150 --> 00:54:23.160 align:start position:0%
credits from large emitting plants and
 
00:54:25.589 --> 00:54:25.599 align:start position:0%
businesses so there's a track backing of
 
00:54:27.549 --> 00:54:27.559 align:start position:0%
their emission and there's a credits
 
00:54:28.829 --> 00:54:28.839 align:start position:0%
program that they're required to
 
00:54:32.030 --> 00:54:32.040 align:start position:0%
participate in it is not rate payer
 
00:54:36.990 --> 00:54:37.000 align:start position:0%
funding and so so the fact that no one
 
00:54:39.829 --> 00:54:39.839 align:start position:0%
else is doing rebates back to rate
 
00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
payers uh from that money and that they
 
00:54:43.789 --> 00:54:43.799 align:start position:0%
are using it to get their states ahead
 
00:54:46.510 --> 00:54:46.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of Investments on lowering
 
00:54:49.069 --> 00:54:49.079 align:start position:0%
emissions um it it really says something
 
00:54:51.789 --> 00:54:51.799 align:start position:0%
about how we view the program so I just
 
00:54:54.349 --> 00:54:54.359 align:start position:0%
want to put out there that this bill is
 
00:54:57.390 --> 00:54:57.400 align:start position:0%
just one example this term of us trying
 
00:55:00.349 --> 00:55:00.359 align:start position:0%
to say that some of that money should be
 
00:55:03.589 --> 00:55:03.599 align:start position:0%
used to advance uh lowering emissions in
 
00:55:03.599 --> 00:55:04.710 align:start position:0%
used to advance uh lowering emissions in
the

00:55:04.710 --> 00:55:04.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:55:08.109 --> 00:55:08.119 align:start position:0%
state representative Bernardi has a
 
00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
comment thank you Mr chair uh as uh
 
00:55:14.349 --> 00:55:14.359 align:start position:0%
representative Kennedy uh
 
00:55:17.670 --> 00:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
articulated uh I I agree philosophically
 
00:55:20.349 --> 00:55:20.359 align:start position:0%
with that approach I am philosophically
 
00:55:23.390 --> 00:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
against this concept and one of the
 
00:55:26.150 --> 00:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
things that we asked in a uh hearing
 
00:55:30.029 --> 00:55:30.039 align:start position:0%
last week was when the uh utilities
 
00:55:35.589 --> 00:55:35.599 align:start position:0%
created uh their their plans uh for the
 
00:55:39.710 --> 00:55:39.720 align:start position:0%
uh ex uh maintenance and growth of their
 
00:55:42.390 --> 00:55:42.400 align:start position:0%
system in the future that they they
 
00:55:46.470 --> 00:55:46.480 align:start position:0%
identify that part of the growth in the
 
00:55:49.390 --> 00:55:49.400 align:start position:0%
distribution Network that is tied to the
 
00:55:52.870 --> 00:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
need to expand it with additional wiring
 
00:55:55.190 --> 00:55:55.200 align:start position:0%
and additional Transformers to support
 
00:56:00.309 --> 00:56:00.319 align:start position:0%
support uh the EV Market uh I I think
 
00:56:05.230 --> 00:56:05.240 align:start position:0%
it's it's uh inappropriate that the rate
 
00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:08.640 align:start position:0%
payers be paying higher electric bills
 
00:56:13.230 --> 00:56:13.240 align:start position:0%
for a building out of the distribution
 
00:56:17.309 --> 00:56:17.319 align:start position:0%
system when they don't own an EV
 
00:56:21.029 --> 00:56:21.039 align:start position:0%
themselves we seem to be debating the
 
00:56:24.109 --> 00:56:24.119 align:start position:0%
bill itself rather than discussing the
 
00:56:24.119 --> 00:56:25.470 align:start position:0%
bill itself rather than discussing the
amendment

00:56:25.470 --> 00:56:25.480 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:26.960 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to try
 
00:56:30.390 --> 00:56:30.400 align:start position:0%
to redirect the conversation a little
 
00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:32.710 align:start position:0%
to redirect the conversation a little
bit

00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:32.720 align:start position:0%
bit
 
00:56:37.549 --> 00:56:37.559 align:start position:0%
by commenting on line one of page
 
00:56:41.109 --> 00:56:41.119 align:start position:0%
two which speaks of
 
00:56:44.150 --> 00:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
returning or federal income tax returns
 
00:56:47.109 --> 00:56:47.119 align:start position:0%
of $300,000 for married couples filing
 
00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:50.720 align:start position:0%
jointly $225,000 for heads of households
 
00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
and 150,000 for all other
 
00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:55.670 align:start position:0%
and 150,000 for all other
filers

00:56:55.670 --> 00:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
filers
 
00:56:58.029 --> 00:56:58.039 align:start position:0%
and I'm concerned about the Optics of
 
00:57:01.630 --> 00:57:01.640 align:start position:0%
asking someone who pays who makes
 
00:57:04.069 --> 00:57:04.079 align:start position:0%
$118,000 a year and yes I know people
 
00:57:07.630 --> 00:57:07.640 align:start position:0%
who live on $188,000 a year asking them
 
00:57:10.430 --> 00:57:10.440 align:start position:0%
to pay more for electricity so that
 
00:57:15.190 --> 00:57:15.200 align:start position:0%
someone making 300 225 or
 
00:57:17.510 --> 00:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
$150,000 can get a rebate to buy an
 
00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle so I'm wondering would
 
00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
uh changing those dollar amounts
 
00:57:26.069 --> 00:57:26.079 align:start position:0%
lowering those dollar
 
00:57:29.670 --> 00:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
amounts um be
 
00:57:31.950 --> 00:57:31.960 align:start position:0%
worthwhile for this
 
00:57:37.549 --> 00:57:37.559 align:start position:0%
amendment Mr chairman representative mut
 
00:57:42.430 --> 00:57:42.440 align:start position:0%
um I believe it's Maine um they actually
 
00:57:45.589 --> 00:57:45.599 align:start position:0%
their program actually has numbers that
 
00:57:49.150 --> 00:57:49.160 align:start position:0%
are uh exactly half of what the federal
 
00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:50.270 align:start position:0%
are uh exactly half of what the federal
amounts

00:57:50.270 --> 00:57:50.280 align:start position:0%
amounts
 
00:57:55.870 --> 00:57:55.880 align:start position:0%
are and um you know I I share your
 
00:57:59.670 --> 00:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
concern about the Optics um and if that
 
00:58:04.470 --> 00:58:04.480 align:start position:0%
is a change that um would make this uh
 
00:58:06.670 --> 00:58:06.680 align:start position:0%
Amendment more agreeable I'd certainly
 
00:58:09.069 --> 00:58:09.079 align:start position:0%
not be opposed to
 
00:58:11.430 --> 00:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
it so then the question becomes well
 
00:58:13.630 --> 00:58:13.640 align:start position:0%
what is an agreeable
 
00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:15.309 align:start position:0%
what is an agreeable
level

00:58:15.309 --> 00:58:15.319 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:58:20.270 --> 00:58:20.280 align:start position:0%
um I would argue that maybe 75,000 for
 
00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:21.829 align:start position:0%
um I would argue that maybe 75,000 for
married

00:58:21.829 --> 00:58:21.839 align:start position:0%
married
 
00:58:24.990 --> 00:58:25.000 align:start position:0%
couples and 50,000 for head of
 
00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:27.549 align:start position:0%
couples and 50,000 for head of
households

00:58:27.549 --> 00:58:27.559 align:start position:0%
households
 
00:58:32.029 --> 00:58:32.039 align:start position:0%
and maybe 30,000 for all other flyers
 
00:58:35.069 --> 00:58:35.079 align:start position:0%
filers might be uh more appropriate what
 
00:58:37.910 --> 00:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:40.630 --> 00:58:40.640 align:start position:0%
think representative
 
00:58:44.910 --> 00:58:44.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:50.190 --> 00:58:50.200 align:start position:0%
um it sounds a little bit low but um if
 
00:58:51.910 --> 00:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
that's what it would take to get your
 
00:58:55.230 --> 00:58:55.240 align:start position:0%
support um I would be I would be
 
00:58:57.430 --> 00:58:57.440 align:start position:0%
agreeable to that that would be in the
 
00:59:00.670 --> 00:59:00.680 align:start position:0%
spirit of my remarks earlier that said
 
00:59:03.190 --> 00:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
you know the low priced electric vehicle
 
00:59:05.589 --> 00:59:05.599 align:start position:0%
can really help the uh lower income
 
00:59:07.390 --> 00:59:07.400 align:start position:0%
family and and if that's what we would
 
00:59:10.349 --> 00:59:10.359 align:start position:0%
want to um see happen where we'd want to
 
00:59:13.230 --> 00:59:13.240 align:start position:0%
put our policy emphasis I'd be I'd be in
 
00:59:15.549 --> 00:59:15.559 align:start position:0%
support the real question is would it be
 
00:59:17.670 --> 00:59:17.680 align:start position:0%
effective representative
 
00:59:20.270 --> 00:59:20.280 align:start position:0%
Thomas um I don't have the answer to
 
00:59:22.309 --> 00:59:22.319 align:start position:0%
that question but what I was going to
 
00:59:25.589 --> 00:59:25.599 align:start position:0%
comment on is that um home deep workers
 
00:59:27.829 --> 00:59:27.839 align:start position:0%
seem to be um twice now they've been
 
00:59:30.670 --> 00:59:30.680 align:start position:0%
sort of demonized as being destitute
 
00:59:32.990 --> 00:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
workers uh my father-in-law works for
 
00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
Home Depot and he would love an
 
00:59:37.029 --> 00:59:37.039 align:start position:0%
opportunity like this and he would take
 
00:59:39.190 --> 00:59:39.200 align:start position:0%
advantage of it because he sees the
 
00:59:41.910 --> 00:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
whole picture the big picture just want
 
00:59:43.270 --> 00:59:43.280 align:start position:0%
to put
 
00:59:46.870 --> 00:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
a for Home Depot
 
00:59:50.309 --> 00:59:50.319 align:start position:0%
workers okay representative MC
 
00:59:53.670 --> 00:59:53.680 align:start position:0%
Williams thanks chair Vose um I I do
 
00:59:56.270 --> 00:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
think that we could reduce the amount um
 
00:59:58.829 --> 00:59:58.839 align:start position:0%
I think that 75,000 for married couples
 
01:00:01.230 --> 01:00:01.240 align:start position:0%
is low um I think you're more likely to
 
01:00:04.190 --> 01:00:04.200 align:start position:0%
get 75,000 for head of household so
 
01:00:06.029 --> 01:00:06.039 align:start position:0%
instead of 50,000 for head of household
 
01:00:08.510 --> 01:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
I would say 75,000 per head of household
 
01:00:10.670 --> 01:00:10.680 align:start position:0%
married couples um I think we probably
 
01:00:12.349 --> 01:00:12.359 align:start position:0%
want to just pull a little bit more data
 
01:00:15.349 --> 01:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
about what the the average is and also
 
01:00:17.910 --> 01:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
what we consider to be lowincome in
 
01:00:21.549 --> 01:00:21.559 align:start position:0%
terms of being able to qualify for um
 
01:00:24.109 --> 01:00:24.119 align:start position:0%
some kind of state support uh because I
 
01:00:27.430 --> 01:00:27.440 align:start position:0%
think 75,000 may not actually Encompass
 
01:00:29.630 --> 01:00:29.640 align:start position:0%
the higher range of lwi income in New
 
01:00:31.750 --> 01:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I would probably think that's
 
01:00:35.230 --> 01:00:35.240 align:start position:0%
closer to 85 possibly 95 but I can get
 
01:00:37.390 --> 01:00:37.400 align:start position:0%
some more data on that for you I just
 
01:00:38.990 --> 01:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to exclude people who
 
01:00:40.910 --> 01:00:40.920 align:start position:0%
otherwise would be included under other
 
01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
metrics by throwing out a number that's
 
01:00:46.870 --> 01:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
a quarter of the uh Federal
 
01:00:49.069 --> 01:00:49.079 align:start position:0%
amount representative
 
01:00:51.309 --> 01:00:51.319 align:start position:0%
Arrington uh yeah two things I wanted to
 
01:00:53.029 --> 01:00:53.039 align:start position:0%
correct a statement made earlier on
 
01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
Reggie uh it it's a cap and trade
 
01:00:57.109 --> 01:00:57.119 align:start position:0%
program that's correct but the money
 
01:00:58.789 --> 01:00:58.799 align:start position:0%
comes directly from the rate payers
 
01:01:02.069 --> 01:01:02.079 align:start position:0%
because the Reggie program forces uh
 
01:01:04.510 --> 01:01:04.520 align:start position:0%
producers of electricity that use fossil
 
01:01:06.349 --> 01:01:06.359 align:start position:0%
fuels most of the case we're talking
 
01:01:08.670 --> 01:01:08.680 align:start position:0%
about natural gas which sets the the
 
01:01:10.910 --> 01:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
price of electricity to pay a higher
 
01:01:12.870 --> 01:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
price they pay a penalty for that and
 
01:01:14.670 --> 01:01:14.680 align:start position:0%
that penalty of course is directly pay
 
01:01:16.950 --> 01:01:16.960 align:start position:0%
passed on to the rate payers so every
 
01:01:18.670 --> 01:01:18.680 align:start position:0%
Reggie penny comes from the rate payer
 
01:01:20.349 --> 01:01:20.359 align:start position:0%
so this would definitely be rate payer
 
01:01:23.510 --> 01:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
money second this is still a wealth uh
 
01:01:25.230 --> 01:01:25.240 align:start position:0%
transfer program I don't care if you put
 
01:01:28.510 --> 01:01:28.520 align:start position:0%
the limited 50,000 or 100,000 or 5,000
 
01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
it's simply not up to the government to
 
01:01:31.789 --> 01:01:31.799 align:start position:0%
be taking money from one person and
 
01:01:33.549 --> 01:01:33.559 align:start position:0%
giving it to the other because some
 
01:01:35.309 --> 01:01:35.319 align:start position:0%
people think electric cars are a good
 
01:01:37.029 --> 01:01:37.039 align:start position:0%
idea if you think electric cars are a
 
01:01:39.390 --> 01:01:39.400 align:start position:0%
good idea go buy one if you want to give
 
01:01:41.270 --> 01:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
someone else money to buy an electric
 
01:01:43.390 --> 01:01:43.400 align:start position:0%
car give them your money but I I will
 
01:01:45.109 --> 01:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
not support anything no matter what the
 
01:01:47.510 --> 01:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
limits are on expanding another program
 
01:01:49.430 --> 01:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
to take the government to forcibly take
 
01:01:51.150 --> 01:01:51.160 align:start position:0%
money from one group and give it to
 
01:01:52.950 --> 01:01:52.960 align:start position:0%
another because somebody thinks it's a
 
01:01:57.829 --> 01:01:57.839 align:start position:0%
good idea representative n has a comment
 
01:02:01.029 --> 01:02:01.039 align:start position:0%
I concur with representative
 
01:02:03.269 --> 01:02:03.279 align:start position:0%
Harrington representative
 
01:02:05.630 --> 01:02:05.640 align:start position:0%
Corman thank you and actually this is a
 
01:02:08.990 --> 01:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
question for uh my friend representative
 
01:02:12.349 --> 01:02:12.359 align:start position:0%
muns which is there's nothing in here
 
01:02:14.710 --> 01:02:14.720 align:start position:0%
about people who lease
 
01:02:18.710 --> 01:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
EVs and I would think that many people
 
01:02:22.109 --> 01:02:22.119 align:start position:0%
are releasing EVS in large part because
 
01:02:24.230 --> 01:02:24.240 align:start position:0%
they are concerned that the technology
 
01:02:27.309 --> 01:02:27.319 align:start position:0%
is is improving so fast that they don't
 
01:02:30.829 --> 01:02:30.839 align:start position:0%
want to be quote stuck with an EV for
 
01:02:32.710 --> 01:02:32.720 align:start position:0%
several years and it might be better to
 
01:02:35.109 --> 01:02:35.119 align:start position:0%
lease one for three years and then get a
 
01:02:37.470 --> 01:02:37.480 align:start position:0%
an upgraded model with longer range
 
01:02:39.750 --> 01:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
faster charging uh was there any thought
 
01:02:40.710 --> 01:02:40.720 align:start position:0%
given to
 
01:02:44.190 --> 01:02:44.200 align:start position:0%
leasing representative Ms first I want
 
01:02:46.750 --> 01:02:46.760 align:start position:0%
to thank my friend representative Corman
 
01:02:48.789 --> 01:02:48.799 align:start position:0%
for you know posing that challenging
 
01:02:51.549 --> 01:02:51.559 align:start position:0%
question to me
 
01:02:54.670 --> 01:02:54.680 align:start position:0%
um there was no specific discussion of
 
01:02:56.870 --> 01:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
of leasing but since leasing is
 
01:03:00.549 --> 01:03:00.559 align:start position:0%
basically a way of financing a vehicle I
 
01:03:05.190 --> 01:03:05.200 align:start position:0%
would assume that you know that would
 
01:03:07.789 --> 01:03:07.799 align:start position:0%
that would qualify uh but that is an
 
01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:09.839 align:start position:0%
assumption you know what they say about
 
01:03:12.109 --> 01:03:12.119 align:start position:0%
assume um and since I have the mic I
 
01:03:13.950 --> 01:03:13.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to just clarify something when I
 
01:03:15.789 --> 01:03:15.799 align:start position:0%
mentioned that uh there were lower
 
01:03:17.109 --> 01:03:17.119 align:start position:0%
standards in Maine it's actually
 
01:03:19.230 --> 01:03:19.240 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts that has the lower
 
01:03:22.150 --> 01:03:22.160 align:start position:0%
standards um and I also agree with
 
01:03:24.470 --> 01:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
representative mc mc Williams that I
 
01:03:27.910 --> 01:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
think the levels that you're proposing
 
01:03:30.910 --> 01:03:30.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chair are probably a little bit too
 
01:03:33.349 --> 01:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
low representative
 
01:03:36.710 --> 01:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
PL uh thank you chair I had a question
 
01:03:38.430 --> 01:03:38.440 align:start position:0%
which I withdrew when you brought us
 
01:03:41.630 --> 01:03:41.640 align:start position:0%
back to the amendment and now that we
 
01:03:44.029 --> 01:03:44.039 align:start position:0%
brought back I'd like to thank you for
 
01:03:47.670 --> 01:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
trying to be the idea of bipartisanship
 
01:03:50.589 --> 01:03:50.599 align:start position:0%
but I won't be voting for this amendment
 
01:03:53.789 --> 01:03:53.799 align:start position:0%
because this does have this does nothing
 
01:03:56.710 --> 01:03:56.720 align:start position:0%
to l lower our electrical rates which is
 
01:03:58.710 --> 01:03:58.720 align:start position:0%
one the highest
 
01:04:01.829 --> 01:04:01.839 align:start position:0%
nor um level the demand this might even
 
01:04:04.910 --> 01:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
increase demand issues we the Peaks and
 
01:04:07.829 --> 01:04:07.839 align:start position:0%
valleys this does not help and those are
 
01:04:10.309 --> 01:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
two reasons and I won't be supporting
 
01:04:12.029 --> 01:04:12.039 align:start position:0%
this thank
 
01:04:15.549 --> 01:04:15.559 align:start position:0%
you representative rals thank you Mr
 
01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
chairman I just hopefully can be helpful
 
01:04:20.069 --> 01:04:20.079 align:start position:0%
about representative corman's question
 
01:04:22.910 --> 01:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
and about the uh applicability of a
 
01:04:25.910 --> 01:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
rebate to the lease
 
01:04:27.150 --> 01:04:27.160 align:start position:0%
I think our
 
01:04:29.750 --> 01:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
bill we maybe we should just we should
 
01:04:32.190 --> 01:04:32.200 align:start position:0%
specify but that's the way the federal
 
01:04:36.029 --> 01:04:36.039 align:start position:0%
tax credit in fact can work uh I bought
 
01:04:39.549 --> 01:04:39.559 align:start position:0%
an electric vehicle I leased it uh you
 
01:04:42.069 --> 01:04:42.079 align:start position:0%
basically can apply the lease uh the the
 
01:04:45.269 --> 01:04:45.279 align:start position:0%
rebate the the federal tax credit to a a
 
01:04:47.190 --> 01:04:47.200 align:start position:0%
buy down of the
 
01:04:50.789 --> 01:04:50.799 align:start position:0%
price uh so the dealer
 
01:04:54.990 --> 01:04:55.000 align:start position:0%
gets gets the you know in this case ,000
 
01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:55.910 align:start position:0%
gets gets the you know in this case ,000
and

01:04:55.910 --> 01:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:05:00.029 --> 01:05:00.039 align:start position:0%
then the lease amount that the customer
 
01:05:02.069 --> 01:05:02.079 align:start position:0%
has to pay is
 
01:05:05.630 --> 01:05:05.640 align:start position:0%
reduced so it it works it can it can be
 
01:05:08.190 --> 01:05:08.200 align:start position:0%
applied either as a credit on the
 
01:05:10.109 --> 01:05:10.119 align:start position:0%
purchase or a buy down of the lease
 
01:05:14.309 --> 01:05:14.319 align:start position:0%
amount which then the lease Lor
 
01:05:16.510 --> 01:05:16.520 align:start position:0%
experiences the benefit over the benefit
 
01:05:18.269 --> 01:05:18.279 align:start position:0%
term of the
 
01:05:21.470 --> 01:05:21.480 align:start position:0%
lease this is a cash on the hood program
 
01:05:24.269 --> 01:05:24.279 align:start position:0%
for a point of sale electric vehicle
 
01:05:27.470 --> 01:05:27.480 align:start position:0%
rebates to buyers that would seem to
 
01:05:30.510 --> 01:05:30.520 align:start position:0%
preclude leasing as a financing method
 
01:05:33.069 --> 01:05:33.079 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it we probably ought to modify
 
01:05:35.150 --> 01:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
if we go
 
01:05:39.549 --> 01:05:39.559 align:start position:0%
forward further comments representative
 
01:05:42.990 --> 01:05:43.000 align:start position:0%
parall thank you chair I heard earlier
 
01:05:45.150 --> 01:05:45.160 align:start position:0%
that uh it's not the role of government
 
01:05:47.950 --> 01:05:47.960 align:start position:0%
to uh take money from one group of
 
01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
people and give it to another I think
 
01:05:50.630 --> 01:05:50.640 align:start position:0%
that's a
 
01:05:53.230 --> 01:05:53.240 align:start position:0%
constitutional provision that taxation
 
01:05:56.470 --> 01:05:56.480 align:start position:0%
is part of our system and we do this all
 
01:05:58.190 --> 01:05:58.200 align:start position:0%
the time I don't think this is something
 
01:06:01.390 --> 01:06:01.400 align:start position:0%
new that we're Reinventing as a means of
 
01:06:03.510 --> 01:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
robbing poor people to give money to
 
01:06:04.710 --> 01:06:04.720 align:start position:0%
rich people I think it's quite the
 
01:06:07.390 --> 01:06:07.400 align:start position:0%
opposite but I would also add that when
 
01:06:09.910 --> 01:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
it comes to that money we just lost $15
 
01:06:12.309 --> 01:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
million because of our inability to move
 
01:06:13.710 --> 01:06:13.720 align:start position:0%
on charging
 
01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:15.269 align:start position:0%
on charging
stations

01:06:15.269 --> 01:06:15.279 align:start position:0%
stations
 
01:06:18.470 --> 01:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
um of the of our New Hampshire citizens
 
01:06:20.430 --> 01:06:20.440 align:start position:0%
tax dollars going to the federal level
 
01:06:21.910 --> 01:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
we should have had that money coming
 
01:06:24.190 --> 01:06:24.200 align:start position:0%
back into New Hampshire and it's law and
 
01:06:26.470 --> 01:06:26.480 align:start position:0%
it's turning our back on the EV industry
 
01:06:28.750 --> 01:06:28.760 align:start position:0%
repeatedly that causes us to not get
 
01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
this kind of federal support which loses
 
01:06:33.950 --> 01:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
us real money in New Hampshire we're not
 
01:06:36.870 --> 01:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
serving the taxpayers of New Hampshire
 
01:06:39.510 --> 01:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
when we pass laws that make the EV
 
01:06:41.750 --> 01:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
Market unfriendly and I would also add
 
01:06:43.470 --> 01:06:43.480 align:start position:0%
one other thing to uh representative
 
01:06:47.269 --> 01:06:47.279 align:start position:0%
pl's comment if I may um I'm very
 
01:06:50.029 --> 01:06:50.039 align:start position:0%
excited about de um decentralizing our
 
01:06:52.269 --> 01:06:52.279 align:start position:0%
grid and one of the ways we can do it is
 
01:06:54.950 --> 01:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
by getting Battery Technology into the
 
01:06:59.829 --> 01:06:59.839 align:start position:0%
home and if we have more EVS e EVS are
 
01:07:04.390 --> 01:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
easily designed to uh charge at night
 
01:07:06.750 --> 01:07:06.760 align:start position:0%
when demand is low and they can even
 
01:07:08.829 --> 01:07:08.839 align:start position:0%
return that charge during the day
 
01:07:11.029 --> 01:07:11.039 align:start position:0%
lowering the curve low our demand curve
 
01:07:13.630 --> 01:07:13.640 align:start position:0%
which is I think a concern that we both
 
01:07:16.150 --> 01:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
have so I really think that this would
 
01:07:18.430 --> 01:07:18.440 align:start position:0%
probably be a benefit rather than a uh
 
01:07:21.309 --> 01:07:21.319 align:start position:0%
deficit to our uh
 
01:07:24.990 --> 01:07:25.000 align:start position:0%
grid thank you further discussion on
 
01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:29.950 align:start position:0%
grid thank you further discussion on
Amendment

01:07:29.950 --> 01:07:29.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:32.470 --> 01:07:32.480 align:start position:0%
0342 representative
 
01:07:34.630 --> 01:07:34.640 align:start position:0%
McWilliams um so just coming back to the
 
01:07:37.870 --> 01:07:37.880 align:start position:0%
numbers chair Vos uh it looks like
 
01:07:39.630 --> 01:07:39.640 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts uh had some really good
 
01:07:41.950 --> 01:07:41.960 align:start position:0%
reasons for including the income at the
 
01:07:44.549 --> 01:07:44.559 align:start position:0%
levels that they did for lower income
 
01:07:48.390 --> 01:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
and getting people who otherwise uh may
 
01:07:50.029 --> 01:07:50.039 align:start position:0%
not be able to purchase an EV because
 
01:07:51.750 --> 01:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
they can't financially afford it to
 
01:07:53.069 --> 01:07:53.079 align:start position:0%
participate in the program and I
 
01:07:54.829 --> 01:07:54.839 align:start position:0%
certainly hear your concerns and the
 
01:07:56.349 --> 01:07:56.359 align:start position:0%
concerns of some of my other colleagues
 
01:07:58.910 --> 01:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
around this table uh in terms of people
 
01:08:00.670 --> 01:08:00.680 align:start position:0%
who are at the higher end of the income
 
01:08:02.910 --> 01:08:02.920 align:start position:0%
Spectrum should be able to purchase
 
01:08:05.230 --> 01:08:05.240 align:start position:0%
without an incentive and perhaps we
 
01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
should be focusing a little bit more on
 
01:08:09.630 --> 01:08:09.640 align:start position:0%
people who need the help um so I would
 
01:08:11.829 --> 01:08:11.839 align:start position:0%
say that going with the Massachusetts
 
01:08:14.029 --> 01:08:14.039 align:start position:0%
guidelines is probably at this point
 
01:08:16.630 --> 01:08:16.640 align:start position:0%
knowing what we know a reasonable step
 
01:08:18.789 --> 01:08:18.799 align:start position:0%
for an amendment to the amendment so
 
01:08:20.829 --> 01:08:20.839 align:start position:0%
that we are targeting folks who
 
01:08:23.390 --> 01:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
otherwise may not be able to and not
 
01:08:25.189 --> 01:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
opening up wider to people who could
 
01:08:26.870 --> 01:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
take advantage without actually needing
 
01:08:28.669 --> 01:08:28.679 align:start position:0%
the benefit so for that reason I would
 
01:08:30.669 --> 01:08:30.679 align:start position:0%
support an amendment to the amendment
 
01:08:32.030 --> 01:08:32.040 align:start position:0%
and I would hope that I could get your
 
01:08:35.269 --> 01:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:37.829 --> 01:08:37.839 align:start position:0%
Vose additional discussion on the
 
01:08:40.669 --> 01:08:40.679 align:start position:0%
amendment representative lewicki um Mr
 
01:08:43.349 --> 01:08:43.359 align:start position:0%
chairman I don't disagree with um
 
01:08:46.430 --> 01:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
changing limits however it seems clear
 
01:08:48.630 --> 01:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
to me that we are going to send this out
 
01:08:50.510 --> 01:08:50.520 align:start position:0%
a committee with a mixed recommendation
 
01:08:55.590 --> 01:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
and uh whatever the dollar amounts are
 
01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:59.269 align:start position:0%
and uh whatever the dollar amounts are
additional

01:08:59.269 --> 01:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:01.349 --> 01:09:01.359 align:start position:0%
discussion okay seeing none I think we
 
01:09:03.749 --> 01:09:03.759 align:start position:0%
can move on from this uh piece of
 
01:09:03.759 --> 01:09:06.470 align:start position:0%
can move on from this uh piece of
proposed

01:09:06.470 --> 01:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:10.269 --> 01:09:10.279 align:start position:0%
legislation and folks who uh wanted to
 
01:09:13.870 --> 01:09:13.880 align:start position:0%
attend this uh work session to uh move
 
01:09:16.910 --> 01:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
on to other things yes representative Ms
 
01:09:19.229 --> 01:09:19.239 align:start position:0%
um B based on you know where we kind of
 
01:09:21.189 --> 01:09:21.199 align:start position:0%
left that I mean I'd be I'd be happy to
 
01:09:22.829 --> 01:09:22.839 align:start position:0%
submit an amendment request to lower
 
01:09:24.950 --> 01:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
those amounts I'll bring that to the
 
01:09:26.910 --> 01:09:26.920 align:start position:0%
meeting this
 
01:09:31.070 --> 01:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
afternoon okay you can do
 
01:09:34.510 --> 01:09:34.520 align:start position:0%
that now let's talk about House Bill
 
01:09:37.070 --> 01:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
1078 relative to first responder
 
01:09:41.430 --> 01:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
organization access to wireless tower
 
01:09:43.630 --> 01:09:43.640 align:start position:0%
collocation and this is another bill for
 
01:09:46.309 --> 01:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
which we have an
 
01:09:48.789 --> 01:09:48.799 align:start position:0%
amendment the amendment
 
01:09:48.799 --> 01:09:50.390 align:start position:0%
amendment the amendment
is

01:10:00.510 --> 01:10:00.520 align:start position:0%
H and the amendment is sponsored by
 
01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi who will explain
 
01:10:08.270 --> 01:10:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:10.630 --> 01:10:10.640 align:start position:0%
US Representative n do you have
 
01:10:13.270 --> 01:10:13.280 align:start position:0%
something first um yes representative PR
 
01:10:14.830 --> 01:10:14.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to be here for this one he had to
 
01:10:16.950 --> 01:10:16.960 align:start position:0%
run to Edna do you mind if I go fetch
 
01:10:20.630 --> 01:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:25.189 --> 01:10:25.199 align:start position:0%
do while she does that I'll ask uh
 
01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi to make a few
 
01:10:28.950 --> 01:10:28.960 align:start position:0%
General remarks
 
01:10:32.430 --> 01:10:32.440 align:start position:0%
about uh the need for
 
01:10:36.430 --> 01:10:36.440 align:start position:0%
this amendment and then maybe by the
 
01:10:39.350 --> 01:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
time representative PR returns you can
 
01:10:43.270 --> 01:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
talk about some of the details of the
 
01:10:45.950 --> 01:10:45.960 align:start position:0%
amendment representative Bernardi thank
 
01:10:49.709 --> 01:10:49.719 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair well uh there's not a lot
 
01:10:52.430 --> 01:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
to say about this amendment we discussed
 
01:10:54.790 --> 01:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
it fairly thoroughly
 
01:10:58.830 --> 01:10:58.840 align:start position:0%
um in our last working session the issue
 
01:11:01.830 --> 01:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
that came up was the fact that the
 
01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:03.110 align:start position:0%
that came up was the fact that the
original

01:11:03.110 --> 01:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
original
 
01:11:08.790 --> 01:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
Bill cited RSA 12
 
01:11:11.709 --> 01:11:11.719 align:start position:0%
K1 when it was
 
01:11:11.719 --> 01:11:13.310 align:start position:0%
K1 when it was
amended

01:11:13.310 --> 01:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
amended
 
01:11:16.709 --> 01:11:16.719 align:start position:0%
OS changed the RSA
 
01:11:16.719 --> 01:11:18.310 align:start position:0%
OS changed the RSA
chapter

01:11:18.310 --> 01:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
chapter
 
01:11:21.870 --> 01:11:21.880 align:start position:0%
appropriately to 21
 
01:11:25.910 --> 01:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
P38 but the Lang anguage at the top of
 
01:11:29.870 --> 01:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
the bill where it says this bill amends
 
01:11:35.550 --> 01:11:35.560 align:start position:0%
X to Y whatever never got changed
 
01:11:40.390 --> 01:11:40.400 align:start position:0%
so um what has been done
 
01:11:44.990 --> 01:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
is have have OS correct that
 
01:11:47.870 --> 01:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
deficiency basically saying amend the
 
01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
the bill by replacing in its entirety
 
01:11:54.350 --> 01:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
the enacting clause and and and then the
 
01:11:57.910 --> 01:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
same language that we discussed last
 
01:12:01.990 --> 01:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
last week is what remains in in lines 22
 
01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:03.310 align:start position:0%
last week is what remains in in lines 22
to

01:12:03.310 --> 01:12:03.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:12:07.510 --> 01:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
25 which basically reflects the fact
 
01:12:10.950 --> 01:12:10.960 align:start position:0%
that uh and recognizes the fact that we
 
01:12:13.709 --> 01:12:13.719 align:start position:0%
have gaps in both radio and Broadband
 
01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
communication coverage for police fire
 
01:12:21.669 --> 01:12:21.679 align:start position:0%
and other First Responders and we need a
 
01:12:24.310 --> 01:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
mechanism to fix them what had been
 
01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
proposed in the original bill was to get
 
01:12:28.790 --> 01:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
access to the tops
 
01:12:33.510 --> 01:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
of uh Towers uh or new towers um that
 
01:12:36.470 --> 01:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
are being installed old towers that
 
01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:40.199 align:start position:0%
exist and there may be some space or
 
01:12:44.270 --> 01:12:44.280 align:start position:0%
whatever um that was deemed not an
 
01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:46.510 align:start position:0%
whatever um that was deemed not an
appropriate

01:12:46.510 --> 01:12:46.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
01:12:51.189 --> 01:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
uh Bill and and so what this bill does
 
01:12:56.590 --> 01:12:56.600 align:start position:0%
is first examine um where the gaps are
 
01:12:59.470 --> 01:12:59.480 align:start position:0%
and then secondly make
 
01:13:02.910 --> 01:13:02.920 align:start position:0%
recommendations on various strategies to
 
01:13:08.310 --> 01:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
fix those problems it's as simple as
 
01:13:11.070 --> 01:13:11.080 align:start position:0%
that okay on a discussion on the
 
01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:14.310 align:start position:0%
that okay on a discussion on the
amendment

01:13:14.310 --> 01:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:18.070 --> 01:13:18.080 align:start position:0%
0438 representative Thomas thank you Mr
 
01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:19.590 align:start position:0%
0438 representative Thomas thank you Mr
chair

01:13:19.590 --> 01:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:13:22.709 --> 01:13:22.719 align:start position:0%
um regarding this amendment and I I
 
01:13:24.390 --> 01:13:24.400 align:start position:0%
believe it's a wrong Amendment I'm not
 
01:13:26.030 --> 01:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
opposed to it but the department of
 
01:13:28.990 --> 01:13:29.000 align:start position:0%
safety opposed the original Bill have
 
01:13:31.189 --> 01:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
you um connected with them regarding
 
01:13:33.350 --> 01:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
this amendment at
 
01:13:36.750 --> 01:13:36.760 align:start position:0%
all yes they were involved in in this in
 
01:13:39.950 --> 01:13:39.960 align:start position:0%
this uh and their their opposition well
 
01:13:42.470 --> 01:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
they declared neutrality but I would
 
01:13:44.470 --> 01:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
agree that tended to be a somewhat
 
01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:45.629 align:start position:0%
agree that tended to be a somewhat
negative

01:13:45.629 --> 01:13:45.639 align:start position:0%
negative
 
01:13:50.510 --> 01:13:50.520 align:start position:0%
neutrality um but uh um and and there
 
01:13:53.189 --> 01:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
wasn't an original earlier Amendment
 
01:13:55.189 --> 01:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
where where we had asked the department
 
01:13:59.310 --> 01:13:59.320 align:start position:0%
of safety to actually do the engineering
 
01:14:02.910 --> 01:14:02.920 align:start position:0%
studies regarding the gaps uh and I
 
01:14:07.470 --> 01:14:07.480 align:start position:0%
think they um came to the table that one
 
01:14:09.110 --> 01:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
they didn't have those resources and it
 
01:14:11.830 --> 01:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
wasn't in the current budget so this
 
01:14:15.750 --> 01:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
bill allows a budgetary cycle to pick up
 
01:14:18.629 --> 01:14:18.639 align:start position:0%
on whatever strategies and
 
01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
recommendations may be forthcoming and
 
01:14:24.470 --> 01:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
then potentially be budgeted for
 
01:14:27.830 --> 01:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
remedies in the future okay thank you
 
01:14:30.310 --> 01:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington and thank you
 
01:14:31.950 --> 01:14:31.960 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question um
 
01:14:33.270 --> 01:14:33.280 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to make sure kind of
 
01:14:35.070 --> 01:14:35.080 align:start position:0%
looking at this it seems to be pretty
 
01:14:37.510 --> 01:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
Common Sense Bill and straightforward
 
01:14:38.830 --> 01:14:38.840 align:start position:0%
I'm just kind of surprised we're not
 
01:14:41.149 --> 01:14:41.159 align:start position:0%
doing this that the Department of
 
01:14:44.350 --> 01:14:44.360 align:start position:0%
Emergency uh management powers and uh
 
01:14:45.550 --> 01:14:45.560 align:start position:0%
whatever they were called the division
 
01:14:47.390 --> 01:14:47.400 align:start position:0%
of emergency services and communication
 
01:14:49.070 --> 01:14:49.080 align:start position:0%
they're not already looking at things
 
01:14:51.390 --> 01:14:51.400 align:start position:0%
like this as part of their routine
 
01:14:54.750 --> 01:14:54.760 align:start position:0%
duties uh apparently they don't they
 
01:14:58.149 --> 01:14:58.159 align:start position:0%
don't they don't focus on that
 
01:15:03.149 --> 01:15:03.159 align:start position:0%
uh except when State Communications are
 
01:15:06.590 --> 01:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
involved but when towns or cities have
 
01:15:09.669 --> 01:15:09.679 align:start position:0%
gaps it is it doesn't rise to their
 
01:15:13.870 --> 01:15:13.880 align:start position:0%
level of examination all right thank you
 
01:15:16.590 --> 01:15:16.600 align:start position:0%
representative reels uh thank you Mr
 
01:15:19.910 --> 01:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
chairman yeah I just um want
 
01:15:23.310 --> 01:15:23.320 align:start position:0%
to thank representative Bernardi for
 
01:15:26.390 --> 01:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
working on this amendment um seems to me
 
01:15:28.910 --> 01:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
like a a similar situation to the the
 
01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
earlier Bill we were talking about 1700
 
01:15:36.430 --> 01:15:36.440 align:start position:0%
where original Bill sort of took a you
 
01:15:40.390 --> 01:15:40.400 align:start position:0%
know flail at uh a solution to a problem
 
01:15:42.149 --> 01:15:42.159 align:start position:0%
and probably wasn't the right solution
 
01:15:46.030 --> 01:15:46.040 align:start position:0%
and um while this this bill is going to
 
01:15:51.310 --> 01:15:51.320 align:start position:0%
instead uh have us have us the state um
 
01:15:53.990 --> 01:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
go take a real look at the problem and
 
01:15:57.229 --> 01:15:57.239 align:start position:0%
uh gather the information needed to
 
01:15:59.430 --> 01:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
craft an actual solution to the problem
 
01:16:02.510 --> 01:16:02.520 align:start position:0%
so uh good work and I'm going to be
 
01:16:05.229 --> 01:16:05.239 align:start position:0%
supporting Vice chair Thomas thank you
 
01:16:09.590 --> 01:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
Mr chair uh I agree and I fully support
 
01:16:12.270 --> 01:16:12.280 align:start position:0%
this amendment the point I would like to
 
01:16:15.830 --> 01:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
make is that this involves um in my
 
01:16:19.510 --> 01:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
opinion critical safety Communications
 
01:16:24.430 --> 01:16:24.440 align:start position:0%
with towns and counties and and also I'm
 
01:16:27.110 --> 01:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
beginning to think that maybe uh
 
01:16:30.390 --> 01:16:30.400 align:start position:0%
sometimes legislation may need to look
 
01:16:32.350 --> 01:16:32.360 align:start position:0%
into things like this because in a
 
01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
similar bill that we agreed to have inim
 
01:16:37.430 --> 01:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
study on that pointed to a problem with
 
01:16:39.910 --> 01:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
critical Communications that for some
 
01:16:42.310 --> 01:16:42.320 align:start position:0%
reason were not being tended to in a
 
01:16:44.629 --> 01:16:44.639 align:start position:0%
timely manner uh a little bit different
 
01:16:46.510 --> 01:16:46.520 align:start position:0%
case but still it centers on
 
01:16:48.350 --> 01:16:48.360 align:start position:0%
Communications which is what this bill
 
01:16:51.790 --> 01:16:51.800 align:start position:0%
does as well so I would I I believe that
 
01:16:54.310 --> 01:16:54.320 align:start position:0%
this is a good case of when we as
 
01:16:56.430 --> 01:16:56.440 align:start position:0%
legislators need to find out what's
 
01:16:58.750 --> 01:16:58.760 align:start position:0%
going out there in the commercial world
 
01:17:00.270 --> 01:17:00.280 align:start position:0%
how come we're having some issues
 
01:17:01.709 --> 01:17:01.719 align:start position:0%
occasionally with critical
 
01:17:04.350 --> 01:17:04.360 align:start position:0%
Communications involving Safety First
 
01:17:07.149 --> 01:17:07.159 align:start position:0%
Responders we need to uh NE not
 
01:17:09.070 --> 01:17:09.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily make any mandates but we do
 
01:17:11.830 --> 01:17:11.840 align:start position:0%
need to investigate and find out what
 
01:17:13.470 --> 01:17:13.480 align:start position:0%
can be done to make this better so I
 
01:17:14.870 --> 01:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
think this is a very important issue
 
01:17:17.070 --> 01:17:17.080 align:start position:0%
that that's coming
 
01:17:21.990 --> 01:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:31.030 align:start position:0%
 
discussion

01:17:31.030 --> 01:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:34.149 --> 01:17:34.159 align:start position:0%
seeing none I guess uh we're done with
 
01:17:36.470 --> 01:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
our discussion and our work session on
 
01:17:38.550 --> 01:17:38.560 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
01:17:40.870 --> 01:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
1078 and I get the sense from the
 
01:17:43.390 --> 01:17:43.400 align:start position:0%
committee that this um Amendment and the
 
01:17:45.669 --> 01:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
bill will move forward when we go to
 
01:17:48.990 --> 01:17:49.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
afternoon so now we'll move on to house
 
01:17:55.669 --> 01:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
bill 14 1987 relative to the health
 
01:17:59.189 --> 01:17:59.199 align:start position:0%
effects of 5G
 
01:18:01.750 --> 01:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
technology there are no amendments
 
01:18:04.110 --> 01:18:04.120 align:start position:0%
proposed for this
 
01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:06.470 align:start position:0%
proposed for this
legislation

01:18:06.470 --> 01:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:18:11.030 --> 01:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
and I will point out that the
 
01:18:15.070 --> 01:18:15.080 align:start position:0%
original Bill directed the Department of
 
01:18:18.550 --> 01:18:18.560 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services to do a bunch of
 
01:18:22.990 --> 01:18:23.000 align:start position:0%
um communication about the effects of of
 
01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:24.830 align:start position:0%
um communication about the effects of of
electromagnetic

01:18:24.830 --> 01:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
electromagnetic
 
01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:26.830 align:start position:0%
electromagnetic
radiation

01:18:26.830 --> 01:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
radiation
 
01:18:29.510 --> 01:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
and it would appear that the Department
 
01:18:31.110 --> 01:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
of Health and services would have been
 
01:18:34.430 --> 01:18:34.440 align:start position:0%
the more appropriate uh agency to deal
 
01:18:36.950 --> 01:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
with that so I think the legislation is
 
01:18:40.229 --> 01:18:40.239 align:start position:0%
essentially flawed and would have a
 
01:18:42.510 --> 01:18:42.520 align:start position:0%
difficult time moving forward but I'm
 
01:18:43.870 --> 01:18:43.880 align:start position:0%
interested to hear what other people
 
01:18:47.790 --> 01:18:47.800 align:start position:0%
might have to say representative Corman
 
01:18:50.149 --> 01:18:50.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh regardless of
 
01:18:54.149 --> 01:18:54.159 align:start position:0%
which agency is tasked
 
01:18:56.790 --> 01:18:56.800 align:start position:0%
I I could not possibly support this I
 
01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:57.870 align:start position:0%
I I could not possibly support this I
feel

01:18:57.870 --> 01:18:57.880 align:start position:0%
feel
 
01:19:00.310 --> 01:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
that there there are so many
 
01:19:03.070 --> 01:19:03.080 align:start position:0%
requirements here that that I just don't
 
01:19:07.390 --> 01:19:07.400 align:start position:0%
see them making any sense PSAs about the
 
01:19:10.110 --> 01:19:10.120 align:start position:0%
health risks associated with radiation
 
01:19:13.550 --> 01:19:13.560 align:start position:0%
we don't know those health risks um
 
01:19:16.870 --> 01:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
requiring uh signage on every
 
01:19:21.110 --> 01:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
pole uh of course the the idea of
 
01:19:24.470 --> 01:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
eliminating Wireless within schools I
 
01:19:26.270 --> 01:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
mean there's just so much here that is
 
01:19:28.910 --> 01:19:28.920 align:start position:0%
entirely unworkable that there's no way
 
01:19:31.629 --> 01:19:31.639 align:start position:0%
I could support this bill regardless of
 
01:19:34.709 --> 01:19:34.719 align:start position:0%
which agency or agencies were
 
01:19:37.070 --> 01:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
tasked representative
 
01:19:39.110 --> 01:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
Harrington yeah yeah I'll have to agree
 
01:19:41.430 --> 01:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
with everything was just said once again
 
01:19:42.709 --> 01:19:42.719 align:start position:0%
so maybe something Good's going to
 
01:19:45.709 --> 01:19:45.719 align:start position:0%
happen for the Celtics or something um
 
01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
this is It's just impractical first of
 
01:19:49.709 --> 01:19:49.719 align:start position:0%
all there's no FM on this and we've got
 
01:19:51.430 --> 01:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
the Environmental Services climbing all
 
01:19:52.990 --> 01:19:53.000 align:start position:0%
over all these polls and putting up
 
01:19:55.910 --> 01:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
signs and I would assume this this is
 
01:19:57.470 --> 01:19:57.480 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of dollars worth
 
01:19:59.750 --> 01:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
of Labor just to get this stuff done and
 
01:20:01.390 --> 01:20:01.400 align:start position:0%
you know I sympathize with the people
 
01:20:03.709 --> 01:20:03.719 align:start position:0%
who have this issue but this is not the
 
01:20:05.709 --> 01:20:05.719 align:start position:0%
solution to it going this
 
01:20:08.990 --> 01:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
way Vice chair Thomas thank you Mr chair
 
01:20:11.229 --> 01:20:11.239 align:start position:0%
I totally agree this uh bill is
 
01:20:14.350 --> 01:20:14.360 align:start position:0%
unworkable I'd like to point out that we
 
01:20:16.510 --> 01:20:16.520 align:start position:0%
had a commission that came up with a
 
01:20:19.510 --> 01:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
bunch of recommendations some time ago
 
01:20:21.709 --> 01:20:21.719 align:start position:0%
and although they were studied those
 
01:20:24.229 --> 01:20:24.239 align:start position:0%
recommended Solutions were deemed to be
 
01:20:27.390 --> 01:20:27.400 align:start position:0%
um either unworkable or too expensive
 
01:20:29.990 --> 01:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
and then we had a study committee done
 
01:20:32.750 --> 01:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
to talk about the commission and another
 
01:20:34.590 --> 01:20:34.600 align:start position:0%
bill that came forward and that study
 
01:20:37.950 --> 01:20:37.960 align:start position:0%
committee came up with uh the near same
 
01:20:40.390 --> 01:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
conclusion uh all only offering that
 
01:20:43.790 --> 01:20:43.800 align:start position:0%
maybe towns uh may have a say on in
 
01:20:47.110 --> 01:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
location of certain uh Towers if they
 
01:20:48.950 --> 01:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
would go and find out how how they could
 
01:20:52.030 --> 01:20:52.040 align:start position:0%
do those things and then we had here we
 
01:20:54.550 --> 01:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
had testimon which really offered no new
 
01:20:57.750 --> 01:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
information from the other two uh bills
 
01:21:00.110 --> 01:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
that previously submitted so I I think
 
01:21:02.709 --> 01:21:02.719 align:start position:0%
this uh there's a problem here we
 
01:21:05.229 --> 01:21:05.239 align:start position:0%
understand people uh have some medical
 
01:21:07.669 --> 01:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
issues uh that they do suffer from some
 
01:21:10.550 --> 01:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
conditions uh but again there's just
 
01:21:13.189 --> 01:21:13.199 align:start position:0%
correlation and causation don't seem to
 
01:21:16.790 --> 01:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
be there enough to make this bill at all
 
01:21:20.149 --> 01:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
workable so I I would be voting against
 
01:21:23.270 --> 01:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
this bill as well representative nter
 
01:21:25.229 --> 01:21:25.239 align:start position:0%
has passed out
 
01:21:29.629 --> 01:21:29.639 align:start position:0%
a um passed out has passed out yeah
 
01:21:33.590 --> 01:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:35.910 --> 01:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
distributed a slide presentation that
 
01:21:38.430 --> 01:21:38.440 align:start position:0%
she prepared the last time we had a 5G
 
01:21:42.350 --> 01:21:42.360 align:start position:0%
Bill and uh she's provided a copy of
 
01:21:44.669 --> 01:21:44.679 align:start position:0%
that for everybody just to refresh your
 
01:21:48.870 --> 01:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
memory further discussion representative
 
01:21:53.229 --> 01:21:53.239 align:start position:0%
fog thank you chair um I I won't be
 
01:21:55.110 --> 01:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill even though I do
 
01:21:58.149 --> 01:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
have questions about the 5G and from
 
01:22:01.470 --> 01:22:01.480 align:start position:0%
people I have heard from but this bill
 
01:22:05.790 --> 01:22:05.800 align:start position:0%
is unworkable thank you further
 
01:22:09.149 --> 01:22:09.159 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Ms thank you
 
01:22:12.510 --> 01:22:12.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um I I've been I've been
 
01:22:13.950 --> 01:22:13.960 align:start position:0%
struggling with this bill I mean I'll be
 
01:22:15.830 --> 01:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
honest with you when I first heard it I
 
01:22:18.030 --> 01:22:18.040 align:start position:0%
said no then no no way those
 
01:22:21.030 --> 01:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
recommendations seem off the- wall and
 
01:22:23.189 --> 01:22:23.199 align:start position:0%
then um
 
01:22:26.990 --> 01:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
I was I was reminded via a article that
 
01:22:29.590 --> 01:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
appeared in the Portsmouth Herald uh
 
01:22:33.430 --> 01:22:33.440 align:start position:0%
yesterday that of of the 5G commission
 
01:22:36.950 --> 01:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
and so I I pulled out the report and did
 
01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:37.790 align:start position:0%
and so I I pulled out the report and did
a

01:22:37.790 --> 01:22:37.800 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:22:40.470 --> 01:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
comparison and with the exception of the
 
01:22:42.950 --> 01:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
well well no all of the recommendations
 
01:22:44.430 --> 01:22:44.440 align:start position:0%
that are included in this bill were
 
01:22:47.550 --> 01:22:47.560 align:start position:0%
included were were recommended by that
 
01:22:49.830 --> 01:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
commission by the majority of that
 
01:22:51.709 --> 01:22:51.719 align:start position:0%
commission and it was a bipartisan
 
01:22:54.149 --> 01:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
commission headed Ed up by Patrick
 
01:22:57.550 --> 01:22:57.560 align:start position:0%
abami and um you know stat
 
01:22:59.550 --> 01:22:59.560 align:start position:0%
Representative Patrick abami who you
 
01:23:02.070 --> 01:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
know is long serving
 
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
representative um and also um then state
 
01:23:08.350 --> 01:23:08.360 align:start position:0%
senator Tom Dr Tom
 
01:23:10.750 --> 01:23:10.760 align:start position:0%
Sherman and
 
01:23:13.390 --> 01:23:13.400 align:start position:0%
um so I'm I'm struggling a little bit
 
01:23:14.990 --> 01:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
with you know trying to respect the
 
01:23:17.189 --> 01:23:17.199 align:start position:0%
process I mean we spent a lot of time
 
01:23:19.709 --> 01:23:19.719 align:start position:0%
and effort putting together a
 
01:23:22.990 --> 01:23:23.000 align:start position:0%
report and now there's a bill Implement
 
01:23:27.030 --> 01:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
that report um so I don't I don't know
 
01:23:30.629 --> 01:23:30.639 align:start position:0%
that I necessarily there isn't any real
 
01:23:33.149 --> 01:23:33.159 align:start position:0%
conclusion that I'm drawing but um I'm
 
01:23:35.870 --> 01:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
just sharing kind of my my thought
 
01:23:38.550 --> 01:23:38.560 align:start position:0%
process that you know um a lot of people
 
01:23:40.189 --> 01:23:40.199 align:start position:0%
spent a lot of more lot more time on
 
01:23:42.830 --> 01:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
this than we did and are and came up
 
01:23:44.510 --> 01:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
with these recommendations and now
 
01:23:48.550 --> 01:23:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:51.350 --> 01:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
law thank you further discussion
 
01:23:53.470 --> 01:23:53.480 align:start position:0%
representative lewicki uh thank you Mr
 
01:23:55.750 --> 01:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
chairman I think that if we're going to
 
01:23:58.590 --> 01:23:58.600 align:start position:0%
do uh anything it's got to recognize the
 
01:24:00.110 --> 01:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
things that are in Representatives not
 
01:24:02.430 --> 01:24:02.440 align:start position:0%
as presentation which is power and
 
01:24:06.950 --> 01:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
frequency the um that thing puts out 12
 
01:24:10.030 --> 01:24:10.040 align:start position:0%
Watts um the laptops that I see open are
 
01:24:11.830 --> 01:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
putting out some unknown number of watts
 
01:24:14.669 --> 01:24:14.679 align:start position:0%
of power in the Wi-Fi right here in this
 
01:24:17.750 --> 01:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
room um now are we going to stop that
 
01:24:19.510 --> 01:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
are we going to start recognizing limits
 
01:24:21.870 --> 01:24:21.880 align:start position:0%
can we say that you know some minimum
 
01:24:25.669 --> 01:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
amount of power is um you know di
 
01:24:28.070 --> 01:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
Minimus you know essentially at the
 
01:24:30.990 --> 01:24:31.000 align:start position:0%
noise floor because without that this is
 
01:24:32.950 --> 01:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
meaningless if somebody puts up a tower
 
01:24:34.510 --> 01:24:34.520 align:start position:0%
and puts one of those things on top of
 
01:24:39.030 --> 01:24:39.040 align:start position:0%
it um and that's all there is um is this
 
01:24:41.350 --> 01:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
um the same as somebody putting up a
 
01:24:45.390 --> 01:24:45.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:48.669 --> 01:24:48.679 align:start position:0%
Watts representative
 
01:24:51.910 --> 01:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
Kennedy thank you Mr chairman um i' just
 
01:24:54.310 --> 01:24:54.320 align:start position:0%
like to make a comment to uh the
 
01:24:57.189 --> 01:24:57.199 align:start position:0%
preceding comment which is that the the
 
01:25:00.510 --> 01:25:00.520 align:start position:0%
effect on you know biological tissue
 
01:25:03.390 --> 01:25:03.400 align:start position:0%
depends on frequency it does not depend
 
01:25:07.109 --> 01:25:07.119 align:start position:0%
on power because a certain amount of
 
01:25:09.990 --> 01:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
energy is delivered it's a photon and
 
01:25:12.669 --> 01:25:12.679 align:start position:0%
that depends on frequency so that's
 
01:25:14.629 --> 01:25:14.639 align:start position:0%
that's why there's always so much focus
 
01:25:18.470 --> 01:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
on frequency because ultraviolet
 
01:25:21.990 --> 01:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
radiation x-rays whatever they are of a
 
01:25:24.270 --> 01:25:24.280 align:start position:0%
fre frequency where they can they can
 
01:25:26.470 --> 01:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
deliver a photon which breaks chemical
 
01:25:29.310 --> 01:25:29.320 align:start position:0%
bonds which ionizes molecules and those
 
01:25:32.270 --> 01:25:32.280 align:start position:0%
are the things that do
 
01:25:34.510 --> 01:25:34.520 align:start position:0%
damage representative
 
01:25:37.470 --> 01:25:37.480 align:start position:0%
fog thank you chair yes I concur with
 
01:25:40.590 --> 01:25:40.600 align:start position:0%
representative Ms the report does show a
 
01:25:45.750 --> 01:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
lot but I go back to before I go here I
 
01:25:47.990 --> 01:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
believe this is not
 
01:25:51.470 --> 01:25:51.480 align:start position:0%
ended this issue will come back and
 
01:25:53.470 --> 01:25:53.480 align:start position:0%
we'll see what when that happens but
 
01:25:56.790 --> 01:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
once again this to myself this bill is
 
01:25:56.800 --> 01:25:57.669 align:start position:0%
once again this to myself this bill is
not

01:25:57.669 --> 01:25:57.679 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:26:01.149 --> 01:26:01.159 align:start position:0%
it representative Thomas thank you Mr
 
01:26:03.790 --> 01:26:03.800 align:start position:0%
chair um I'm not going to beat a dead
 
01:26:06.270 --> 01:26:06.280 align:start position:0%
horse but this bill although it may have
 
01:26:08.510 --> 01:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
originated from some recommendations
 
01:26:10.950 --> 01:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
from that committee goes all over the
 
01:26:13.750 --> 01:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
place and it just it's trying to do too
 
01:26:16.910 --> 01:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
much and in particular the the
 
01:26:18.750 --> 01:26:18.760 align:start position:0%
requirement for schools to go to
 
01:26:21.870 --> 01:26:21.880 align:start position:0%
hardwired equipment that um is going to
 
01:26:24.950 --> 01:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
direct affect specialed kids that use
 
01:26:28.350 --> 01:26:28.360 align:start position:0%
devices uh for communication and there's
 
01:26:30.950 --> 01:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
no way I can support
 
01:26:33.390 --> 01:26:33.400 align:start position:0%
this representative
 
01:26:36.030 --> 01:26:36.040 align:start position:0%
Ms thank you Mr chair yeah I I probably
 
01:26:37.470 --> 01:26:37.480 align:start position:0%
should have clarified some of my
 
01:26:40.550 --> 01:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
comments I mean I I do I do agree with
 
01:26:43.109 --> 01:26:43.119 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas that um the
 
01:26:45.870 --> 01:26:45.880 align:start position:0%
provisions around requiring uh schools
 
01:26:48.189 --> 01:26:48.199 align:start position:0%
moving away from Wireless that that to
 
01:26:49.990 --> 01:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
me is definitely a step too far because
 
01:26:52.870 --> 01:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
that has too too many implications and I
 
01:26:55.629 --> 01:26:55.639 align:start position:0%
certainly wouldn't support the bill uh
 
01:26:59.350 --> 01:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
just based on that um but I think a lot
 
01:27:02.270 --> 01:27:02.280 align:start position:0%
of the other recommendations are really
 
01:27:06.470 --> 01:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
about um you know kind of notification
 
01:27:08.750 --> 01:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
and data collection um you know the
 
01:27:11.550 --> 01:27:11.560 align:start position:0%
notifications are similar somewhat to
 
01:27:15.189 --> 01:27:15.199 align:start position:0%
you know how we started um raising
 
01:27:17.310 --> 01:27:17.320 align:start position:0%
awareness about tobacco products putting
 
01:27:22.350 --> 01:27:22.360 align:start position:0%
a warning on cigarette packs um and you
 
01:27:24.390 --> 01:27:24.400 align:start position:0%
know the other in the other some of the
 
01:27:25.990 --> 01:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
other recommendations are very similar
 
01:27:29.870 --> 01:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
to what we just talked about with the um
 
01:27:32.310 --> 01:27:32.320 align:start position:0%
the the uh Forest Products registry it's
 
01:27:35.229 --> 01:27:35.239 align:start position:0%
collecting data uh to see you know to
 
01:27:38.870 --> 01:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
what extent is there a problem and
 
01:27:42.189 --> 01:27:42.199 align:start position:0%
um you know as I said earlier I'm I I'm
 
01:27:46.189 --> 01:27:46.199 align:start position:0%
still struggling with this but I I I
 
01:27:49.470 --> 01:27:49.480 align:start position:0%
keep I keep recalling comments that I've
 
01:27:51.550 --> 01:27:51.560 align:start position:0%
heard a number of people say is that you
 
01:27:53.830 --> 01:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
know 10 years ago we didn't think P was
 
01:27:55.790 --> 01:27:55.800 align:start position:0%
a problem and now it's generally
 
01:27:59.109 --> 01:27:59.119 align:start position:0%
recognized as a problem and is this the
 
01:28:01.109 --> 01:28:01.119 align:start position:0%
next p episode that we're going to be
 
01:28:03.470 --> 01:28:03.480 align:start position:0%
dealing with and based on that is it
 
01:28:06.709 --> 01:28:06.719 align:start position:0%
worthwhile at least letting people know
 
01:28:08.590 --> 01:28:08.600 align:start position:0%
that this is going on without saying
 
01:28:10.189 --> 01:28:10.199 align:start position:0%
that it's harmful or not but just that
 
01:28:13.310 --> 01:28:13.320 align:start position:0%
it's happening and start collecting some
 
01:28:15.790 --> 01:28:15.800 align:start position:0%
data we can probably put an end to your
 
01:28:18.390 --> 01:28:18.400 align:start position:0%
struggles by pointing out that there is
 
01:28:20.109 --> 01:28:20.119 align:start position:0%
no money appropriated by this
 
01:28:23.109 --> 01:28:23.119 align:start position:0%
legislation to do the work that the bill
 
01:28:25.430 --> 01:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
wants to do there's not even an FN
 
01:28:27.550 --> 01:28:27.560 align:start position:0%
designation so we can't even send it to
 
01:28:30.590 --> 01:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
finance and ask them to find some money
 
01:28:33.030 --> 01:28:33.040 align:start position:0%
it's just not implementable the way it's
 
01:28:34.950 --> 01:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
written representative
 
01:28:38.310 --> 01:28:38.320 align:start position:0%
parshall thank you chair um somebody
 
01:28:40.629 --> 01:28:40.639 align:start position:0%
smarter than my than me once said that
 
01:28:43.669 --> 01:28:43.679 align:start position:0%
the uh most Savage controversies are
 
01:28:46.189 --> 01:28:46.199 align:start position:0%
those about matters to which there's no
 
01:28:49.550 --> 01:28:49.560 align:start position:0%
good evidence either way I still feel
 
01:28:52.430 --> 01:28:52.440 align:start position:0%
that way about the way our regulation of
 
01:28:55.430 --> 01:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
5G technology which is I think
 
01:28:56.550 --> 01:28:56.560 align:start position:0%
representative keny pointed out
 
01:28:58.310 --> 01:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
correctly that we are talking about
 
01:29:00.830 --> 01:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
frequency we are not talking about power
 
01:29:02.950 --> 01:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
I think it's a very accurate statement I
 
01:29:05.669 --> 01:29:05.679 align:start position:0%
wish we had a good bill before us that
 
01:29:08.070 --> 01:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
would delve into these issues free from
 
01:29:10.629 --> 01:29:10.639 align:start position:0%
some of the uh junk science that is
 
01:29:12.430 --> 01:29:12.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes attached to this I don't
 
01:29:14.149 --> 01:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
believe this is that bill but I do
 
01:29:17.510 --> 01:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
believe that uh the study committee came
 
01:29:19.189 --> 01:29:19.199 align:start position:0%
up with some very specific regulations
 
01:29:20.470 --> 01:29:20.480 align:start position:0%
and I will continue to support that
 
01:29:22.910 --> 01:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
study committee and legislation that
 
01:29:26.310 --> 01:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
does further the
 
01:29:28.790 --> 01:29:28.800 align:start position:0%
investigation into these areas I think
 
01:29:30.229 --> 01:29:30.239 align:start position:0%
investigation of know you what we're
 
01:29:32.870 --> 01:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
doing is probably the best we can do at
 
01:29:36.270 --> 01:29:36.280 align:start position:0%
this point Thank You representative
 
01:29:39.870 --> 01:29:39.880 align:start position:0%
licki um yeah my I point out that if we
 
01:29:41.990 --> 01:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
were to force all of the schools in the
 
01:29:44.590 --> 01:29:44.600 align:start position:0%
state not only is it an unfunded mandate
 
01:29:46.030 --> 01:29:46.040 align:start position:0%
but this would not cost hundreds of
 
01:29:47.470 --> 01:29:47.480 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars to rewire the
 
01:29:49.790 --> 01:29:49.800 align:start position:0%
schools it would cost millions and uh we
 
01:29:51.229 --> 01:29:51.239 align:start position:0%
would be dumping that on the local
 
01:29:51.239 --> 01:29:54.070 align:start position:0%
would be dumping that on the local
budgets

01:29:54.070 --> 01:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:54.080 --> 01:29:57.350 align:start position:0%
 
additional

01:29:57.350 --> 01:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:00.070 --> 01:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none I think we'll
 
01:30:02.950 --> 01:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
move on next up is House
 
01:30:07.070 --> 01:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
Bill 1508 requiring fiber optic
 
01:30:09.430 --> 01:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
Communication service providers to
 
01:30:12.070 --> 01:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
prioritize service restoration for
 
01:30:14.910 --> 01:30:14.920 align:start position:0%
Public Safety and public health
 
01:30:17.430 --> 01:30:17.440 align:start position:0%
organizations the prime sponsor of this
 
01:30:20.030 --> 01:30:20.040 align:start position:0%
legislation recommended that we refer it
 
01:30:22.550 --> 01:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
for interim study
 
01:30:25.189 --> 01:30:25.199 align:start position:0%
which is a recommendation I think the
 
01:30:27.550 --> 01:30:27.560 align:start position:0%
committee should seriously
 
01:30:30.270 --> 01:30:30.280 align:start position:0%
consider open to discussion Vice chair
 
01:30:33.790 --> 01:30:33.800 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you Mr chair yes this is
 
01:30:35.669 --> 01:30:35.679 align:start position:0%
exactly the other bill I was talking
 
01:30:38.790 --> 01:30:38.800 align:start position:0%
about uh talking about critical safety
 
01:30:41.709 --> 01:30:41.719 align:start position:0%
Communications and I think uh absolutely
 
01:30:44.629 --> 01:30:44.639 align:start position:0%
it's uh important enough to do into to
 
01:30:47.830 --> 01:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
go into interim study uh to find out
 
01:30:50.629 --> 01:30:50.639 align:start position:0%
what legislation if any uh might be
 
01:30:52.350 --> 01:30:52.360 align:start position:0%
applicable to make sure
 
01:30:55.350 --> 01:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
that even dealing with private uh firms
 
01:30:57.189 --> 01:30:57.199 align:start position:0%
we need to make sure that critical
 
01:30:59.590 --> 01:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
safety information Communications First
 
01:31:02.550 --> 01:31:02.560 align:start position:0%
Responders needs are are always met and
 
01:31:04.750 --> 01:31:04.760 align:start position:0%
so I think it's appropriate that we go
 
01:31:06.990 --> 01:31:07.000 align:start position:0%
into interim study on
 
01:31:10.470 --> 01:31:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:13.590 --> 01:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Kennedy thank
 
01:31:15.510 --> 01:31:15.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman just a just a brief
 
01:31:18.229 --> 01:31:18.239 align:start position:0%
comment but the representative who was
 
01:31:19.910 --> 01:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
here for I can't remember exactly what
 
01:31:21.790 --> 01:31:21.800 align:start position:0%
the organization was telephone associ
 
01:31:23.910 --> 01:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
iation or something but you know she
 
01:31:26.030 --> 01:31:26.040 align:start position:0%
pointed out that there there have been
 
01:31:28.430 --> 01:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
protocols for prioritizing Public Safety
 
01:31:31.550 --> 01:31:31.560 align:start position:0%
for a century so I don't know if we need
 
01:31:33.950 --> 01:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
to study it or
 
01:31:39.310 --> 01:31:39.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:41.629 --> 01:31:41.639 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
01:31:43.669 --> 01:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
Gman I actually agree with
 
01:31:46.870 --> 01:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
representative Kennedy um uh it was
 
01:31:48.470 --> 01:31:48.480 align:start position:0%
Teresa Rosenberger from the New
 
01:31:50.229 --> 01:31:50.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire telephone Association and
 
01:31:52.510 --> 01:31:52.520 align:start position:0%
Consolidated communication
 
01:31:54.070 --> 01:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
and she said they already have protocols
 
01:31:55.910 --> 01:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
and this was really a customer service
 
01:31:58.350 --> 01:31:58.360 align:start position:0%
issue and I don't see the need for us to
 
01:32:00.390 --> 01:32:00.400 align:start position:0%
be involved I'm okay with interim study
 
01:32:03.390 --> 01:32:03.400 align:start position:0%
but I don't think that's even
 
01:32:05.590 --> 01:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
necessary further discussion
 
01:32:08.270 --> 01:32:08.280 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington once again I
 
01:32:10.229 --> 01:32:10.239 align:start position:0%
agree with my
 
01:32:13.149 --> 01:32:13.159 align:start position:0%
colleague representative
 
01:32:15.990 --> 01:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
Ms and this is really scary I agree with
 
01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:17.189 align:start position:0%
Ms and this is really scary I agree with
representative

01:32:17.189 --> 01:32:17.199 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:32:20.310 --> 01:32:20.320 align:start position:0%
Harrington um I think it's definitely a
 
01:32:22.750 --> 01:32:22.760 align:start position:0%
uh a customer service issue unfortunate
 
01:32:24.510 --> 01:32:24.520 align:start position:0%
customer service issue but nevertheless
 
01:32:27.709 --> 01:32:27.719 align:start position:0%
a customer service issue representative
 
01:32:31.229 --> 01:32:31.239 align:start position:0%
n shocking even more shocking so I agree
 
01:32:32.350 --> 01:32:32.360 align:start position:0%
with representative muns and
 
01:32:35.430 --> 01:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
representative courtman all right all
 
01:32:38.750 --> 01:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
right I'm piling on this one I agree
 
01:32:41.629 --> 01:32:41.639 align:start position:0%
with representative n all right all
 
01:32:44.270 --> 01:32:44.280 align:start position:0%
right Vice chair
 
01:32:46.510 --> 01:32:46.520 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you Mr chair uh
 
01:32:48.950 --> 01:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
respectfully I disagree with all the
 
01:32:51.990 --> 01:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
others uh and the reason is this it's
 
01:32:54.910 --> 01:32:54.920 align:start position:0%
not so much uh of what was mentioned but
 
01:32:56.870 --> 01:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
one of the issues that came out during
 
01:32:59.990 --> 01:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh public hearing was there appeared to
 
01:33:04.830 --> 01:33:04.840 align:start position:0%
be no belly button specifically for the
 
01:33:08.790 --> 01:33:08.800 align:start position:0%
um uh the town to call when they were in
 
01:33:11.830 --> 01:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
this type of a situation uh suggestion
 
01:33:13.590 --> 01:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
was made rightfully so that they could
 
01:33:16.350 --> 01:33:16.360 align:start position:0%
put a complaint into the AG and perhaps
 
01:33:18.109 --> 01:33:18.119 align:start position:0%
they could get around to it in a couple
 
01:33:21.310 --> 01:33:21.320 align:start position:0%
of weeks or a month but the issue was
 
01:33:24.030 --> 01:33:24.040 align:start position:0%
what happens when a situation like this
 
01:33:27.629 --> 01:33:27.639 align:start position:0%
occurs and the police chief or next time
 
01:33:29.149 --> 01:33:29.159 align:start position:0%
it could be a hospital or it could be
 
01:33:33.510 --> 01:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
fire chief has to get action right now
 
01:33:35.870 --> 01:33:35.880 align:start position:0%
there was no one that they were able to
 
01:33:39.270 --> 01:33:39.280 align:start position:0%
go to that could put pressure or even
 
01:33:41.910 --> 01:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
find out what the issue was outside of
 
01:33:44.709 --> 01:33:44.719 align:start position:0%
calling the CEO of the company so I
 
01:33:48.510 --> 01:33:48.520 align:start position:0%
think that in because of that issue is
 
01:33:51.350 --> 01:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
why I support inm study is to find out
 
01:33:54.430 --> 01:33:54.440 align:start position:0%
if if perhaps there might be something
 
01:33:56.750 --> 01:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
that uh could be that could be put out
 
01:33:58.430 --> 01:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
there or maybe information could be put
 
01:34:01.270 --> 01:34:01.280 align:start position:0%
out there but uh in my opinion in
 
01:34:03.109 --> 01:34:03.119 align:start position:0%
talking to the originator of the bill
 
01:34:06.229 --> 01:34:06.239 align:start position:0%
and the police chief uh they were they
 
01:34:08.430 --> 01:34:08.440 align:start position:0%
were given the runaround they was no
 
01:34:10.950 --> 01:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
single point of contact that they could
 
01:34:13.709 --> 01:34:13.719 align:start position:0%
go to to get something resolved
 
01:34:15.229 --> 01:34:15.239 align:start position:0%
immediately and I think that's my
 
01:34:17.229 --> 01:34:17.239 align:start position:0%
concern and I think that's why I think
 
01:34:19.790 --> 01:34:19.800 align:start position:0%
Kum study might at least bring out
 
01:34:22.310 --> 01:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
either suggestions or maybe none but I
 
01:34:23.990 --> 01:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
think that's what I think that's why
 
01:34:27.109 --> 01:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
interum studies appropriate in in this
 
01:34:31.790 --> 01:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
case good point additional
 
01:34:33.709 --> 01:34:33.719 align:start position:0%
discussion looks like we've run the
 
01:34:36.149 --> 01:34:36.159 align:start position:0%
gamut on this one so let's move on to
 
01:34:38.830 --> 01:34:38.840 align:start position:0%
the last bill that we will discuss
 
01:34:41.550 --> 01:34:41.560 align:start position:0%
during this work session and that is
 
01:34:43.470 --> 01:34:43.480 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
01:34:46.149 --> 01:34:46.159 align:start position:0%
1576 relative to allowing Property
 
01:34:50.149 --> 01:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
Owners to opt out of Public
 
01:34:52.550 --> 01:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
Utilities and we do have an amendment
 
01:34:53.470 --> 01:34:53.480 align:start position:0%
for this
 
01:34:56.229 --> 01:34:56.239 align:start position:0%
bill that amendment is
 
01:35:01.750 --> 01:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
circulating as I speak it is 202
 
01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:04.629 align:start position:0%
circulating as I speak it is 202
24-44

01:35:04.629 --> 01:35:04.639 align:start position:0%
24-44
 
01:35:07.390 --> 01:35:07.400 align:start position:0%
6h and it is
 
01:35:10.709 --> 01:35:10.719 align:start position:0%
a replacement to
 
01:35:13.790 --> 01:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
the uh original Bill
 
01:35:16.830 --> 01:35:16.840 align:start position:0%
including on a replacement of the title
 
01:35:20.590 --> 01:35:20.600 align:start position:0%
it changes the title of the bill from
 
01:35:22.830 --> 01:35:22.840 align:start position:0%
relative to allowing Property Owners to
 
01:35:26.030 --> 01:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
out opt of Public Utilities to the new
 
01:35:28.310 --> 01:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
title which will be relative to suitable
 
01:35:32.870 --> 01:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
building drainage and private water
 
01:35:36.629 --> 01:35:36.639 align:start position:0%
sources it amends a completely different
 
01:35:39.470 --> 01:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
section of existing
 
01:35:44.070 --> 01:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
law and the amendment decreases the feet
 
01:35:46.310 --> 01:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
distance requirement for con for
 
01:35:49.750 --> 01:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
connecting to public sewers from 100 ft
 
01:35:52.550 --> 01:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
to 20 ft
 
01:35:54.629 --> 01:35:54.639 align:start position:0%
and it also prohibits the adoption of
 
01:35:56.750 --> 01:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
the international public code Provisions
 
01:35:58.669 --> 01:35:58.679 align:start position:0%
as they relate to private
 
01:36:00.870 --> 01:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
Wells the bill also permits the
 
01:36:02.629 --> 01:36:02.639 align:start position:0%
replacement of alternative sewage
 
01:36:05.270 --> 01:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
Disposal Systems with other alternative
 
01:36:08.590 --> 01:36:08.600 align:start position:0%
sewage Disposal Systems that are are in
 
01:36:12.030 --> 01:36:12.040 align:start position:0%
compliance with state and local
 
01:36:14.149 --> 01:36:14.159 align:start position:0%
regulations the prime sponsor of the
 
01:36:14.159 --> 01:36:15.350 align:start position:0%
regulations the prime sponsor of the
original

01:36:15.350 --> 01:36:15.360 align:start position:0%
original
 
01:36:18.910 --> 01:36:18.920 align:start position:0%
Bill thinks that this is a more
 
01:36:21.910 --> 01:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate method to address the issue
 
01:36:25.270 --> 01:36:25.280 align:start position:0%
of mandatory Su sewer
 
01:36:29.109 --> 01:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
hookups which can be costly and have
 
01:36:30.790 --> 01:36:30.800 align:start position:0%
other problems
 
01:36:34.750 --> 01:36:34.760 align:start position:0%
for the average citizen so this is her
 
01:36:38.590 --> 01:36:38.600 align:start position:0%
proposed solution I think it's workable
 
01:36:40.870 --> 01:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
and I'd like the committee to consider
 
01:36:43.870 --> 01:36:43.880 align:start position:0%
it representative reels has a comment
 
01:36:45.750 --> 01:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
about the
 
01:36:48.149 --> 01:36:48.159 align:start position:0%
amendment yes Mr chairman thank you and
 
01:36:52.750 --> 01:36:52.760 align:start position:0%
I I do not note that you you are listed
 
01:36:56.790 --> 01:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
um at the top of this sponsoring this
 
01:37:00.510 --> 01:37:00.520 align:start position:0%
amendment but um all of that description
 
01:37:03.830 --> 01:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
makes me wonder why is this being
 
01:37:06.950 --> 01:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
considered by our committee because it
 
01:37:11.990 --> 01:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
seems like a matter of sort of
 
01:37:15.430 --> 01:37:15.440 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services water
 
01:37:17.590 --> 01:37:17.600 align:start position:0%
quality um you know I sort of feel
 
01:37:21.870 --> 01:37:21.880 align:start position:0%
unqualified to to um just whether this
 
01:37:23.669 --> 01:37:23.679 align:start position:0%
is a good thing or a bad thing and since
 
01:37:26.109 --> 01:37:26.119 align:start position:0%
it affects um
 
01:37:28.390 --> 01:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
substantially you know it's kind of
 
01:37:30.390 --> 01:37:30.400 align:start position:0%
almost like a municipal
 
01:37:35.350 --> 01:37:35.360 align:start position:0%
code issue um you know has this been run
 
01:37:37.709 --> 01:37:37.719 align:start position:0%
by the municipal Association uh what are
 
01:37:39.830 --> 01:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
the effects going to be so just
 
01:37:41.830 --> 01:37:41.840 align:start position:0%
wondering I take your point but the
 
01:37:43.709 --> 01:37:43.719 align:start position:0%
simple answer to your question why do we
 
01:37:45.070 --> 01:37:45.080 align:start position:0%
have this bill is because it was
 
01:37:48.390 --> 01:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
originally signed to us assigned to us
 
01:37:52.030 --> 01:37:52.040 align:start position:0%
and there is no method within house
 
01:37:55.990 --> 01:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
rules I don't think of vacating a bill
 
01:37:58.750 --> 01:37:58.760 align:start position:0%
once it's gone through a public hearing
 
01:38:01.390 --> 01:38:01.400 align:start position:0%
and and reach this stage of the process
 
01:38:04.430 --> 01:38:04.440 align:start position:0%
so we're stuck with it whether we like
 
01:38:08.070 --> 01:38:08.080 align:start position:0%
it or not do we do we feel competent to
 
01:38:11.950 --> 01:38:11.960 align:start position:0%
pass judgment on the substance I'm not
 
01:38:14.589 --> 01:38:14.599 align:start position:0%
sure um that's what we're here to
 
01:38:14.599 --> 01:38:16.550 align:start position:0%
sure um that's what we're here to
discuss

01:38:16.550 --> 01:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
discuss
 
01:38:18.910 --> 01:38:18.920 align:start position:0%
so I'll uh look forward to hearing
 
01:38:20.550 --> 01:38:20.560 align:start position:0%
comments and we'll start with Vice chair
 
01:38:22.870 --> 01:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you Mr chair uh let me
 
01:38:25.709 --> 01:38:25.719 align:start position:0%
address the first question first um the
 
01:38:27.870 --> 01:38:27.880 align:start position:0%
reason was simple because the original
 
01:38:30.270 --> 01:38:30.280 align:start position:0%
Bill had the word electricity in
 
01:38:33.070 --> 01:38:33.080 align:start position:0%
there and so going going through the
 
01:38:35.669 --> 01:38:35.679 align:start position:0%
process they you know had to make a
 
01:38:37.589 --> 01:38:37.599 align:start position:0%
choice and it came to us and now it's
 
01:38:40.350 --> 01:38:40.360 align:start position:0%
too late so that's that's uh that's why
 
01:38:45.550 --> 01:38:45.560 align:start position:0%
we have it um I I support this amendment
 
01:38:48.430 --> 01:38:48.440 align:start position:0%
um originally I I didn't think it was
 
01:38:50.270 --> 01:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
something that we might want to do but
 
01:38:52.950 --> 01:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
it seems like it's a workable Amendment
 
01:38:55.350 --> 01:38:55.360 align:start position:0%
apparently I found out some towns may
 
01:38:57.390 --> 01:38:57.400 align:start position:0%
have restrictions I found out recently
 
01:39:00.750 --> 01:39:00.760 align:start position:0%
just last week that in my town of lary
 
01:39:02.910 --> 01:39:02.920 align:start position:0%
there are no such restrictions we we
 
01:39:05.470 --> 01:39:05.480 align:start position:0%
were talking uh profusely about our
 
01:39:07.310 --> 01:39:07.320 align:start position:0%
water issue and about bringing in uh
 
01:39:09.470 --> 01:39:09.480 align:start position:0%
public water down highways and I
 
01:39:11.430 --> 01:39:11.440 align:start position:0%
specifically asked the question would
 
01:39:13.669 --> 01:39:13.679 align:start position:0%
would anyone along that Corridor be
 
01:39:15.910 --> 01:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
required to hook up and the answer was
 
01:39:19.709 --> 01:39:19.719 align:start position:0%
absolutely not um so in my town we don't
 
01:39:21.589 --> 01:39:21.599 align:start position:0%
have that uh restriction
 
01:39:23.950 --> 01:39:23.960 align:start position:0%
uh in fact I Al also uh pleased to hear
 
01:39:26.589 --> 01:39:26.599 align:start position:0%
that even people with Wells if they even
 
01:39:28.790 --> 01:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
if they did hook up to town they would
 
01:39:31.350 --> 01:39:31.360 align:start position:0%
still be able to use your wells for
 
01:39:34.310 --> 01:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
Gardens and you know and and things like
 
01:39:36.750 --> 01:39:36.760 align:start position:0%
that so uh I guess it's a town by Town
 
01:39:40.550 --> 01:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
thing so um I think this amendment will
 
01:39:42.270 --> 01:39:42.280 align:start position:0%
uh perhaps take care of some towns that
 
01:39:44.550 --> 01:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
may have a little more restrictions than
 
01:39:47.510 --> 01:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
than mine does just to clarify I think
 
01:39:51.470 --> 01:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
this particular Amendment refers only to
 
01:39:54.149 --> 01:39:54.159 align:start position:0%
sewer systems I don't think it talks
 
01:39:57.870 --> 01:39:57.880 align:start position:0%
about water although the title
 
01:39:57.880 --> 01:40:00.990 align:start position:0%
about water although the title
does

01:40:00.990 --> 01:40:01.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:04.350 --> 01:40:04.360 align:start position:0%
yeah the last
 
01:40:07.350 --> 01:40:07.360 align:start position:0%
paragraph yeah and speaking of that last
 
01:40:09.430 --> 01:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
private Wells okay all right
 
01:40:12.030 --> 01:40:12.040 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams had us comment
 
01:40:14.109 --> 01:40:14.119 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chair Vose um this is very
 
01:40:15.589 --> 01:40:15.599 align:start position:0%
similar to a couple of bills that I've
 
01:40:17.189 --> 01:40:17.199 align:start position:0%
been working on over the last few years
 
01:40:20.510 --> 01:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
at Edna um in terms of code requirements
 
01:40:23.390 --> 01:40:23.400 align:start position:0%
and passing legislation that impacts
 
01:40:25.870 --> 01:40:25.880 align:start position:0%
recommended code requirements so in the
 
01:40:27.189 --> 01:40:27.199 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire we have the
 
01:40:29.430 --> 01:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
building code review board which meets
 
01:40:31.550 --> 01:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
frequently to review amendments to the
 
01:40:33.910 --> 01:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
codes and has all kinds of process for
 
01:40:36.470 --> 01:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
weighing in and doing custom amendments
 
01:40:38.750 --> 01:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
um specifically the last paragraph in
 
01:40:40.709 --> 01:40:40.719 align:start position:0%
this amendment is something that is
 
01:40:42.629 --> 01:40:42.639 align:start position:0%
worthy of review and discussion by the
 
01:40:45.149 --> 01:40:45.159 align:start position:0%
building code review board and the
 
01:40:47.350 --> 01:40:47.360 align:start position:0%
reason I say this is because we are
 
01:40:49.270 --> 01:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
historically famous in New Hampshire for
 
01:40:52.350 --> 01:40:52.360 align:start position:0%
having small Lots that are individually
 
01:40:54.589 --> 01:40:54.599 align:start position:0%
serviced by their own well and their own
 
01:40:57.629 --> 01:40:57.639 align:start position:0%
septic and in New Hampshire we keep a
 
01:41:00.310 --> 01:41:00.320 align:start position:0%
100 foot radius around an individual
 
01:41:02.350 --> 01:41:02.360 align:start position:0%
well and we say you cannot have your
 
01:41:04.310 --> 01:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
septic in that area because you do not
 
01:41:07.070 --> 01:41:07.080 align:start position:0%
want the two mixing so my concern here
 
01:41:09.510 --> 01:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
about creating a carve out so that the
 
01:41:12.030 --> 01:41:12.040 align:start position:0%
IPC prohibiting private Wells that would
 
01:41:13.550 --> 01:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
otherwise comply with state and local
 
01:41:15.149 --> 01:41:15.159 align:start position:0%
regulations is that suddenly we're
 
01:41:17.310 --> 01:41:17.320 align:start position:0%
pulling the rug out from underneath this
 
01:41:19.430 --> 01:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
100 foot radius that protects people
 
01:41:22.189 --> 01:41:22.199 align:start position:0%
from accidentally mixing sewage and well
 
01:41:23.950 --> 01:41:23.960 align:start position:0%
water together that's no good you'll get
 
01:41:26.430 --> 01:41:26.440 align:start position:0%
sick um so I I think that that's a
 
01:41:27.910 --> 01:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
dangerous paragraph and it's something
 
01:41:31.390 --> 01:41:31.400 align:start position:0%
the bcrb should review and and give full
 
01:41:33.510 --> 01:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
input on if that's something that is
 
01:41:35.510 --> 01:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
included in this overall discussion
 
01:41:37.709 --> 01:41:37.719 align:start position:0%
about requiring toilets which I think
 
01:41:40.070 --> 01:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
makes sense um allowing some kind of
 
01:41:42.030 --> 01:41:42.040 align:start position:0%
historic alternative sewage yes we have
 
01:41:44.950 --> 01:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
old cess pools um and perhaps we do have
 
01:41:47.589 --> 01:41:47.599 align:start position:0%
composting toilets as well uh the 20
 
01:41:49.390 --> 01:41:49.400 align:start position:0%
foot distance changing from 100 foot
 
01:41:51.070 --> 01:41:51.080 align:start position:0%
distance but allowing towns to to go
 
01:41:52.830 --> 01:41:52.840 align:start position:0%
back up to 100 foot I don't really see
 
01:41:54.950 --> 01:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
that as a concern but you probably once
 
01:41:57.070 --> 01:41:57.080 align:start position:0%
again want to get some uh Municipal
 
01:41:58.790 --> 01:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
folks to weigh in on that because I
 
01:42:00.510 --> 01:42:00.520 align:start position:0%
think that in certain towns that's a
 
01:42:01.830 --> 01:42:01.840 align:start position:0%
dangerous thing to do when you have
 
01:42:04.669 --> 01:42:04.679 align:start position:0%
small lot sizes um so overall I think
 
01:42:06.550 --> 01:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
it's okay but I have real concerns about
 
01:42:09.950 --> 01:42:09.960 align:start position:0%
the last paragraph
 
01:42:12.189 --> 01:42:12.199 align:start position:0%
Thanks well I appreciate you bringing
 
01:42:14.910 --> 01:42:14.920 align:start position:0%
that up but reading the language of the
 
01:42:17.669 --> 01:42:17.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:20.310 --> 01:42:20.320 align:start position:0%
says that the department shall not adopt
 
01:42:22.669 --> 01:42:22.679 align:start position:0%
provision of the code that prohibit the
 
01:42:24.109 --> 01:42:24.119 align:start position:0%
use of private
 
01:42:26.750 --> 01:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
Wells which would otherwise comply with
 
01:42:28.950 --> 01:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
state and local regulations so if the
 
01:42:31.709 --> 01:42:31.719 align:start position:0%
100 foot radius that you talked about is
 
01:42:34.270 --> 01:42:34.280 align:start position:0%
a state or a local regist
 
01:42:34.280 --> 01:42:36.470 align:start position:0%
a state or a local regist
regulation

01:42:36.470 --> 01:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
regulation
 
01:42:39.229 --> 01:42:39.239 align:start position:0%
then wouldn't the private well have to
 
01:42:40.550 --> 01:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
comply with
 
01:42:43.870 --> 01:42:43.880 align:start position:0%
that um so we've changed the 100 foot to
 
01:42:45.950 --> 01:42:45.960 align:start position:0%
20 feet throughout the first portion of
 
01:42:48.189 --> 01:42:48.199 align:start position:0%
this so the state regulation is changing
 
01:42:52.149 --> 01:42:52.159 align:start position:0%
to 20 ft meaning that the foot which is
 
01:42:54.870 --> 01:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
currently best practice wouldn't apply
 
01:42:58.830 --> 01:42:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:58.840 --> 01:43:01.350 align:start position:0%
 
20

01:43:01.350 --> 01:43:01.360 align:start position:0%
20
 
01:43:06.070 --> 01:43:06.080 align:start position:0%
okay I see I see what you're saying now
 
01:43:09.350 --> 01:43:09.360 align:start position:0%
um so that bears some investigation I
 
01:43:13.550 --> 01:43:13.560 align:start position:0%
guess H further comments representative
 
01:43:15.910 --> 01:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
Harrington yeah maybe I'm just not
 
01:43:17.790 --> 01:43:17.800 align:start position:0%
reading this right but I read the 20 ft
 
01:43:21.270 --> 01:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
to say that had to do with hooking up to
 
01:43:25.030 --> 01:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
a septic to a public SE system so a
 
01:43:27.470 --> 01:43:27.480 align:start position:0%
public soore so right now if you're
 
01:43:29.390 --> 01:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
within 100 feet you have to hook up this
 
01:43:31.270 --> 01:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
would say you have to hook up within 20
 
01:43:34.189 --> 01:43:34.199 align:start position:0%
ft and unless I'm missing something I
 
01:43:36.070 --> 01:43:36.080 align:start position:0%
don't see that has anything to do with
 
01:43:39.189 --> 01:43:39.199 align:start position:0%
putting in a well uh closer to a a
 
01:43:41.550 --> 01:43:41.560 align:start position:0%
septic system uh I don't know what the
 
01:43:43.910 --> 01:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
international plumbing code is and does
 
01:43:46.070 --> 01:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
anybody know why they someone wants this
 
01:43:48.430 --> 01:43:48.440 align:start position:0%
provision in the law that says that but
 
01:43:50.229 --> 01:43:50.239 align:start position:0%
but I don't think the 20 foot section
 
01:43:53.910 --> 01:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
online 14 changes the distance between
 
01:43:56.510 --> 01:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
septic system and Wells it changes the
 
01:43:58.950 --> 01:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
distance the minimum distance where you
 
01:44:01.030 --> 01:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
have to hook up to a public soore if
 
01:44:02.950 --> 01:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
there's one within 20 ft rather than 100
 
01:44:04.109 --> 01:44:04.119 align:start position:0%
that's way I'm reading it maybe I'm
 
01:44:05.750 --> 01:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
reading it wrong but you seem to know
 
01:44:07.629 --> 01:44:07.639 align:start position:0%
more about the international plumbing
 
01:44:10.149 --> 01:44:10.159 align:start position:0%
code so she's an architect okay well
 
01:44:11.790 --> 01:44:11.800 align:start position:0%
what is it that that someone's trying to
 
01:44:14.109 --> 01:44:14.119 align:start position:0%
avoid any ideas I mean well we have
 
01:44:16.629 --> 01:44:16.639 align:start position:0%
someone here from Dees who maybe can uh
 
01:44:19.149 --> 01:44:19.159 align:start position:0%
shed some light on all this so please
 
01:44:21.149 --> 01:44:21.159 align:start position:0%
come forward and uh
 
01:44:22.830 --> 01:44:22.840 align:start position:0%
help us understand this issue it's kind
 
01:44:27.149 --> 01:44:27.159 align:start position:0%
of out of our ballpark normally so any
 
01:44:28.910 --> 01:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
light You Can Shed would be really
 
01:44:31.550 --> 01:44:31.560 align:start position:0%
appreciated no sure I'm Brandon kernin
 
01:44:32.669 --> 01:44:32.679 align:start position:0%
I'm the administrator of the drinking
 
01:44:34.830 --> 01:44:34.840 align:start position:0%
water and groundwater Bureau I testified
 
01:44:36.709 --> 01:44:36.719 align:start position:0%
with my colleague Tracy wood who's out
 
01:44:38.270 --> 01:44:38.280 align:start position:0%
this week so and she represented
 
01:44:40.189 --> 01:44:40.199 align:start position:0%
Wastewater but my program works a lot
 
01:44:42.070 --> 01:44:42.080 align:start position:0%
with both sides of
 
01:44:45.950 --> 01:44:45.960 align:start position:0%
it thank you so in looking through the
 
01:44:47.950 --> 01:44:47.960 align:start position:0%
bill we definitely as a department have
 
01:44:49.910 --> 01:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of concerns about changing that
 
01:44:53.189 --> 01:44:53.199 align:start position:0%
100 ft to 20 ft as Tracy testified it's
 
01:44:55.189 --> 01:44:55.199 align:start position:0%
really important that a utility be able
 
01:44:57.750 --> 01:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
to plan for their service area and
 
01:45:00.750 --> 01:45:00.760 align:start position:0%
reasonably anticipated revenue and also
 
01:45:03.350 --> 01:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
that communities and the state have the
 
01:45:04.830 --> 01:45:04.840 align:start position:0%
authority to protect surface water
 
01:45:07.830 --> 01:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
bodies and by making it so less people
 
01:45:09.910 --> 01:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
would have to connect to a sewer system
 
01:45:12.270 --> 01:45:12.280 align:start position:0%
both those things are jeopardized um
 
01:45:14.109 --> 01:45:14.119 align:start position:0%
there are Provisions that the town could
 
01:45:16.149 --> 01:45:16.159 align:start position:0%
issue wavers you know from the 100 foot
 
01:45:18.510 --> 01:45:18.520 align:start position:0%
right now and so there is that ability
 
01:45:21.189 --> 01:45:21.199 align:start position:0%
if a town is comfortable with having
 
01:45:22.990 --> 01:45:23.000 align:start position:0%
less people connect to the sewer system
 
01:45:26.229 --> 01:45:26.239 align:start position:0%
when they develop relative to the last
 
01:45:30.030 --> 01:45:30.040 align:start position:0%
part of the amendment it I have to be
 
01:45:32.229 --> 01:45:32.239 align:start position:0%
honest I'm not really sure what's being
 
01:45:34.229 --> 01:45:34.239 align:start position:0%
accomplished here my department my
 
01:45:35.870 --> 01:45:35.880 align:start position:0%
Bureau does regulate the New Hampshire
 
01:45:37.910 --> 01:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
water well board and we work closely
 
01:45:39.629 --> 01:45:39.639 align:start position:0%
with the subsurface Bureau who regulates
 
01:45:41.990 --> 01:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
septic systems and really with the
 
01:45:43.709 --> 01:45:43.719 align:start position:0%
international plumbing code when it
 
01:45:47.149 --> 01:45:47.159 align:start position:0%
comes to water supply Wells it's you
 
01:45:48.870 --> 01:45:48.880 align:start position:0%
know pable water is kind of what you're
 
01:45:51.270 --> 01:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
looking for I'm not sure what this
 
01:45:53.149 --> 01:45:53.159 align:start position:0%
provision means especially relative to
 
01:45:55.109 --> 01:45:55.119 align:start position:0%
referencing the department because it
 
01:45:56.510 --> 01:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
would probably be the mechanical board
 
01:45:57.910 --> 01:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
or another entity that actually
 
01:46:01.270 --> 01:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
maintains plumbing codes in the state so
 
01:46:04.070 --> 01:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm I'm confused to what that
 
01:46:08.470 --> 01:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:12.030 --> 01:46:12.040 align:start position:0%
me representative bernardy has a comment
 
01:46:13.229 --> 01:46:13.239 align:start position:0%
Andor a
 
01:46:17.149 --> 01:46:17.159 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair question so
 
01:46:20.149 --> 01:46:20.159 align:start position:0%
um if I heard you right the concern
 
01:46:23.350 --> 01:46:23.360 align:start position:0%
about the 20 the 100 foot being changed
 
01:46:28.109 --> 01:46:28.119 align:start position:0%
to 20 foot distance um was a financial
 
01:46:34.189 --> 01:46:34.199 align:start position:0%
one for the towns putting in a uh a SE a
 
01:46:36.589 --> 01:46:36.599 align:start position:0%
septic line or
 
01:46:41.629 --> 01:46:41.639 align:start position:0%
or or sewer line not not uh not anything
 
01:46:46.589 --> 01:46:46.599 align:start position:0%
to do with the 100 foot limitation of a
 
01:46:49.629 --> 01:46:49.639 align:start position:0%
uh septic system being away from a well
 
01:46:51.589 --> 01:46:51.599 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
01:46:53.750 --> 01:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
correct I guess I don't I don't think
 
01:46:56.350 --> 01:46:56.360 align:start position:0%
this amendment and I just got it just a
 
01:46:57.870 --> 01:46:57.880 align:start position:0%
couple minutes ago references the
 
01:47:00.430 --> 01:47:00.440 align:start position:0%
distance to a well anywhere in here that
 
01:47:02.189 --> 01:47:02.199 align:start position:0%
would be driven by the Water Well board
 
01:47:03.910 --> 01:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
regulations that we maintain and then
 
01:47:05.709 --> 01:47:05.719 align:start position:0%
also the septic system
 
01:47:08.109 --> 01:47:08.119 align:start position:0%
regulations um so yes it's the distance
 
01:47:10.229 --> 01:47:10.239 align:start position:0%
to a sewer system that this would reduce
 
01:47:11.669 --> 01:47:11.679 align:start position:0%
the number of properties that would have
 
01:47:14.629 --> 01:47:14.639 align:start position:0%
to connect which is problematic both
 
01:47:16.550 --> 01:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
economically and environmentally because
 
01:47:18.790 --> 01:47:18.800 align:start position:0%
when a town builds a Wastewater Plant
 
01:47:20.550 --> 01:47:20.560 align:start position:0%
they have a plan on who's going to
 
01:47:23.510 --> 01:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
connect to it and by less people
 
01:47:26.149 --> 01:47:26.159 align:start position:0%
connecting the viability of that plan is
 
01:47:29.149 --> 01:47:29.159 align:start position:0%
undermined also undermines water quality
 
01:47:30.589 --> 01:47:30.599 align:start position:0%
I mean all throughout the Lakes Region
 
01:47:32.510 --> 01:47:32.520 align:start position:0%
we've seen the impacts of connecting the
 
01:47:35.189 --> 01:47:35.199 align:start position:0%
sewers and the how the Lakes the water
 
01:47:37.189 --> 01:47:37.199 align:start position:0%
quality of the Lakes became better and
 
01:47:39.270 --> 01:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
so by lessening the number of entities
 
01:47:40.990 --> 01:47:41.000 align:start position:0%
that would have to connect um you could
 
01:47:43.189 --> 01:47:43.199 align:start position:0%
jeopardize water quality as well all the
 
01:47:44.830 --> 01:47:44.840 align:start position:0%
while the town does have the authority
 
01:47:46.950 --> 01:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
now to issue waivers to that 100 foot
 
01:47:49.830 --> 01:47:49.840 align:start position:0%
provision but by default cut it by you
 
01:47:55.790 --> 01:47:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:59.790 --> 01:47:59.800 align:start position:0%
you so as I read this
 
01:48:02.550 --> 01:48:02.560 align:start position:0%
amendment and compare it to the original
 
01:48:06.350 --> 01:48:06.360 align:start position:0%
bill it occurs to me that I probably
 
01:48:09.589 --> 01:48:09.599 align:start position:0%
should consult the speaker and the house
 
01:48:13.109 --> 01:48:13.119 align:start position:0%
clerk to find out if this amendment is
 
01:48:15.750 --> 01:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
germine since it modifies a completely
 
01:48:20.350 --> 01:48:20.360 align:start position:0%
different part of Statute and it also
 
01:48:22.070 --> 01:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
does something
 
01:48:24.430 --> 01:48:24.440 align:start position:0%
that's that we know nothing about and
 
01:48:27.270 --> 01:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
have heard no testimony about so that
 
01:48:29.350 --> 01:48:29.360 align:start position:0%
would lead me to the conclusion that we
 
01:48:32.070 --> 01:48:32.080 align:start position:0%
might need
 
01:48:37.669 --> 01:48:37.679 align:start position:0%
to recess our exact session and hold a
 
01:48:40.790 --> 01:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
public hearing on this amendment so what
 
01:48:42.910 --> 01:48:42.920 align:start position:0%
I will do is I will get clarification
 
01:48:45.030 --> 01:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
during our lunch break from the the
 
01:48:47.470 --> 01:48:47.480 align:start position:0%
speaker and the clerk about whether this
 
01:48:50.709 --> 01:48:50.719 align:start position:0%
amend Amendment would be Germaine or not
 
01:48:52.709 --> 01:48:52.719 align:start position:0%
if it's not going to be Germaine then
 
01:48:54.270 --> 01:48:54.280 align:start position:0%
we'll have to have a public hearing on
 
01:48:55.950 --> 01:48:55.960 align:start position:0%
it at some future
 
01:48:58.229 --> 01:48:58.239 align:start position:0%
date now we can continue with our
 
01:49:00.149 --> 01:49:00.159 align:start position:0%
discussion and any questions you might
 
01:49:03.830 --> 01:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
have representative McGee thank you Mr
 
01:49:05.149 --> 01:49:05.159 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
01:49:07.109 --> 01:49:07.119 align:start position:0%
question you mentioned that there were
 
01:49:10.990 --> 01:49:11.000 align:start position:0%
also economic concerns and you didn't
 
01:49:13.910 --> 01:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
say too much about that so are you
 
01:49:15.470 --> 01:49:15.480 align:start position:0%
talking about the economics of the
 
01:49:18.229 --> 01:49:18.239 align:start position:0%
system development not panning out the
 
01:49:20.430 --> 01:49:20.440 align:start position:0%
way it was intended or are there other
 
01:49:22.550 --> 01:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
economic concerns that you wanted to
 
01:49:25.149 --> 01:49:25.159 align:start position:0%
raise that's that's the primary driver
 
01:49:26.870 --> 01:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
when you size a plant you're looking at
 
01:49:29.550 --> 01:49:29.560 align:start position:0%
the properties it's going to serve and
 
01:49:32.470 --> 01:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
you develop a plan that will fund that
 
01:49:33.950 --> 01:49:33.960 align:start position:0%
plant with a certain amount of
 
01:49:37.709 --> 01:49:37.719 align:start position:0%
Wastewater capacity and if if people can
 
01:49:40.550 --> 01:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
opt out or do or connect sporadically it
 
01:49:42.709 --> 01:49:42.719 align:start position:0%
just creates a big mess you have low
 
01:49:45.669 --> 01:49:45.679 align:start position:0%
density of customers to the system so
 
01:49:47.790 --> 01:49:47.800 align:start position:0%
you have all this Force sewer M and
 
01:49:50.149 --> 01:49:50.159 align:start position:0%
whatnot without any utility and then
 
01:49:51.830 --> 01:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
there's the environmental side of it as
 
01:49:56.070 --> 01:49:56.080 align:start position:0%
well so it's revenue and lack of density
 
01:49:59.870 --> 01:49:59.880 align:start position:0%
development yes of course thank you um
 
01:50:02.589 --> 01:50:02.599 align:start position:0%
so you mentioned a big mess and so my
 
01:50:04.430 --> 01:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
question is
 
01:50:06.830 --> 01:50:06.840 align:start position:0%
um I don't really understand the point
 
01:50:08.709 --> 01:50:08.719 align:start position:0%
of the bill I know it's a response to
 
01:50:11.149 --> 01:50:11.159 align:start position:0%
the fact that the original Bill didn't
 
01:50:12.510 --> 01:50:12.520 align:start position:0%
didn't really have legs with this
 
01:50:16.229 --> 01:50:16.239 align:start position:0%
committee um so can you tell us if there
 
01:50:19.270 --> 01:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
is any point from your perspective in in
 
01:50:21.430 --> 01:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:50:23.310 --> 01:50:23.320 align:start position:0%
so Tracy would have a better background
 
01:50:25.669 --> 01:50:25.679 align:start position:0%
than I would Tracy would but from my
 
01:50:27.910 --> 01:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
history at the department there's one
 
01:50:30.070 --> 01:50:30.080 align:start position:0%
off conflicts throughout the state where
 
01:50:32.109 --> 01:50:32.119 align:start position:0%
someone doesn't like the town doesn't
 
01:50:33.470 --> 01:50:33.480 align:start position:0%
want to work Town doesn't want to pay a
 
01:50:37.550 --> 01:50:37.560 align:start position:0%
sewer bill and and therefore these types
 
01:50:39.990 --> 01:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
of bills come up every couple years in
 
01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.550 align:start position:0%
of bills come up every couple years in
my

01:50:42.550 --> 01:50:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:45.430 --> 01:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
experience additional comments
 
01:50:48.470 --> 01:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
representative muns thank you Mr chair
 
01:50:50.870 --> 01:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
yeah I had I can had the same reaction
 
01:50:52.910 --> 01:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
that representative McGee had which was
 
01:50:56.629 --> 01:50:56.639 align:start position:0%
you know what is this trying to solve
 
01:50:59.550 --> 01:50:59.560 align:start position:0%
and um and thank you for your
 
01:51:01.790 --> 01:51:01.800 align:start position:0%
interpretation I mean it seems to me
 
01:51:04.390 --> 01:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
that you know we heard that that that
 
01:51:06.870 --> 01:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities or we heard we we got
 
01:51:10.030 --> 01:51:10.040 align:start position:0%
testimony from um your your your boss
 
01:51:14.069 --> 01:51:14.079 align:start position:0%
commissioner Scott that um
 
01:51:16.669 --> 01:51:16.679 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh can grant waivers on a
 
01:51:18.189 --> 01:51:18.199 align:start position:0%
case-by casee
 
01:51:20.990 --> 01:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
basis and if there are some towns that
 
01:51:24.669 --> 01:51:24.679 align:start position:0%
don't have that process I mean you know
 
01:51:26.310 --> 01:51:26.320 align:start position:0%
the only thing I could see is somehow
 
01:51:28.589 --> 01:51:28.599 align:start position:0%
requiring that towns have to offer a
 
01:51:32.270 --> 01:51:32.280 align:start position:0%
waiver process uh but this seems to be
 
01:51:36.510 --> 01:51:36.520 align:start position:0%
too much of a blanket um program that
 
01:51:38.950 --> 01:51:38.960 align:start position:0%
really doesn't seem to make
 
01:51:41.270 --> 01:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
sense representative
 
01:51:43.910 --> 01:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
Harrington thank you um I'm just trying
 
01:51:46.629 --> 01:51:46.639 align:start position:0%
to couple questions on this this 20 foot
 
01:51:49.030 --> 01:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
thing so to me I'm not quite sure why
 
01:51:50.669 --> 01:51:50.679 align:start position:0%
this would be economic CU I'm assuming
 
01:51:53.069 --> 01:51:53.079 align:start position:0%
this is looking forward only in other
 
01:51:54.669 --> 01:51:54.679 align:start position:0%
words if you were going to put in a
 
01:51:58.030 --> 01:51:58.040 align:start position:0%
septic system under the pre present law
 
01:51:59.950 --> 01:51:59.960 align:start position:0%
I mean a source system public Source
 
01:52:02.350 --> 01:52:02.360 align:start position:0%
system uh you would look out and say
 
01:52:04.069 --> 01:52:04.079 align:start position:0%
this is where I'm going to run the lines
 
01:52:05.790 --> 01:52:05.800 align:start position:0%
this is where how many houses are within
 
01:52:07.270 --> 01:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
100 ft so therefore they're going to
 
01:52:09.030 --> 01:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
have to connect and you could plan
 
01:52:12.830 --> 01:52:12.840 align:start position:0%
accordingly um this would say this is
 
01:52:14.350 --> 01:52:14.360 align:start position:0%
where I want to put run the lines how
 
01:52:17.229 --> 01:52:17.239 align:start position:0%
many houses are more than not 100 ft but
 
01:52:19.109 --> 01:52:19.119 align:start position:0%
within 20t of where I'm projecting to do
 
01:52:21.470 --> 01:52:21.480 align:start position:0%
it so as far as economics go you could
 
01:52:23.149 --> 01:52:23.159 align:start position:0%
you we would know the rules the rules
 
01:52:24.950 --> 01:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
had change but it doesn't affect any
 
01:52:27.589 --> 01:52:27.599 align:start position:0%
existing systems as far as I could tell
 
01:52:29.870 --> 01:52:29.880 align:start position:0%
well there's significant upgrades that
 
01:52:31.310 --> 01:52:31.320 align:start position:0%
have occurred to Wastewater plans
 
01:52:33.069 --> 01:52:33.079 align:start position:0%
throughout the state that are based on
 
01:52:35.709 --> 01:52:35.719 align:start position:0%
buildout plans within a 10 20 year time
 
01:52:38.470 --> 01:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
frame so it it could very much upset
 
01:52:40.669 --> 01:52:40.679 align:start position:0%
plans of certain communities or they
 
01:52:42.189 --> 01:52:42.199 align:start position:0%
could potentially disconnect and then
 
01:52:43.950 --> 01:52:43.960 align:start position:0%
there's the environmental side of it as
 
01:52:46.830 --> 01:52:46.840 align:start position:0%
well followup so what you're saying then
 
01:52:50.390 --> 01:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
is that uh there may be a waste waterers
 
01:52:52.109 --> 01:52:52.119 align:start position:0%
facility out there that's saying okay
 
01:52:54.430 --> 01:52:54.440 align:start position:0%
here's our I don't know 15-year plan
 
01:52:56.750 --> 01:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to do so much for the first
 
01:52:58.669 --> 01:52:58.679 align:start position:0%
5 years and then 10 years and they were
 
01:53:02.189 --> 01:53:02.199 align:start position:0%
all based on that 100 foot uh connection
 
01:53:05.229 --> 01:53:05.239 align:start position:0%
minimum so that by changing it to 20 ft
 
01:53:07.390 --> 01:53:07.400 align:start position:0%
they could lose some of the customers is
 
01:53:09.950 --> 01:53:09.960 align:start position:0%
that correct correct and then also have
 
01:53:12.229 --> 01:53:12.239 align:start position:0%
stranded infrastructure that they were
 
01:53:13.629 --> 01:53:13.639 align:start position:0%
going to get fill in they would never
 
01:53:15.430 --> 01:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
have stretch the system out if they
 
01:53:17.149 --> 01:53:17.159 align:start position:0%
weren't expecting the fill in later in
 
01:53:19.430 --> 01:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
the future and and the the final part of
 
01:53:22.030 --> 01:53:22.040 align:start position:0%
the on the bottom um where it talks
 
01:53:24.069 --> 01:53:24.079 align:start position:0%
about person utilizing an alternative
 
01:53:26.109 --> 01:53:26.119 align:start position:0%
sorage Disposal system would you
 
01:53:28.990 --> 01:53:29.000 align:start position:0%
interpret this to mean that if somebody
 
01:53:32.550 --> 01:53:32.560 align:start position:0%
has a alternate surage Disposal system I
 
01:53:35.270 --> 01:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
guess a septic tank that if that needed
 
01:53:37.750 --> 01:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
to be replaced they could replace it
 
01:53:40.589 --> 01:53:40.599 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether there was a sore
 
01:53:42.830 --> 01:53:42.840 align:start position:0%
now a public sore line within whatever
 
01:53:44.310 --> 01:53:44.320 align:start position:0%
the minimum distance
 
01:53:47.350 --> 01:53:47.360 align:start position:0%
was I read that provision just talk
 
01:53:49.350 --> 01:53:49.360 align:start position:0%
about replacing an existing alternative
 
01:53:50.629 --> 01:53:50.639 align:start position:0%
system with with another alternative
 
01:53:52.030 --> 01:53:52.040 align:start position:0%
system as long as it follows the
 
01:53:53.750 --> 01:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
regulations so I don't quite know it's
 
01:53:55.390 --> 01:53:55.400 align:start position:0%
accomplishing because it's saying follow
 
01:53:57.350 --> 01:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
the regulations right okay that's what
 
01:53:59.310 --> 01:53:59.320 align:start position:0%
that's what I thought one last comment
 
01:54:02.510 --> 01:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um okay I don't know what
 
01:54:05.229 --> 01:54:05.239 align:start position:0%
the international plumbing code is and I
 
01:54:07.430 --> 01:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
don't know what someone putting put this
 
01:54:09.830 --> 01:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
in the law saying to prohibit the use of
 
01:54:11.910 --> 01:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
private Wells so I I couldn't vote for
 
01:54:13.550 --> 01:54:13.560 align:start position:0%
this bill until we get someone to
 
01:54:16.109 --> 01:54:16.119 align:start position:0%
explain what that what that paragraph is
 
01:54:17.589 --> 01:54:17.599 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish so I would
 
01:54:19.390 --> 01:54:19.400 align:start position:0%
certainly go for opening the public
 
01:54:21.510 --> 01:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
hearing again because I simply I can't
 
01:54:24.790 --> 01:54:24.800 align:start position:0%
vote for something I don't know what it
 
01:54:28.149 --> 01:54:28.159 align:start position:0%
is okay I want to alert the before I
 
01:54:29.629 --> 01:54:29.639 align:start position:0%
call on the next person alert the
 
01:54:32.510 --> 01:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
committee to the fact that 11:00 which
 
01:54:35.709 --> 01:54:35.719 align:start position:0%
is 7 minutes from now we will be
 
01:54:38.629 --> 01:54:38.639 align:start position:0%
suspending this work session uh
 
01:54:40.510 --> 01:54:40.520 align:start position:0%
Republicans will be going into caucus in
 
01:54:43.270 --> 01:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
this room and once we complete our
 
01:54:46.629 --> 01:54:46.639 align:start position:0%
caucus we'll all go to lunch so this
 
01:54:48.149 --> 01:54:48.159 align:start position:0%
will be the end of our work session
 
01:54:50.950 --> 01:54:50.960 align:start position:0%
within the next seven minutes
 
01:54:52.790 --> 01:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
01:54:55.350 --> 01:54:55.360 align:start position:0%
PL uh thank you chair and thank you for
 
01:54:59.310 --> 01:54:59.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question um the line 27
 
01:55:05.109 --> 01:55:05.119 align:start position:0%
through of this um refering RSA 4
 
01:55:08.870 --> 01:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
1478 does does that apply to your
 
01:55:10.830 --> 01:55:10.840 align:start position:0%
composting in
 
01:55:13.550 --> 01:55:13.560 align:start position:0%
ouses or is it
 
01:55:16.189 --> 01:55:16.199 align:start position:0%
just good thank you I'm sorry I just
 
01:55:18.229 --> 01:55:18.239 align:start position:0%
wasn't given this ahead of time to cross
 
01:55:20.589 --> 01:55:20.599 align:start position:0%
check the the various stat suits I think
 
01:55:24.310 --> 01:55:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:28.069 --> 01:55:28.079 align:start position:0%
stakeholders follow up uh thank you um
 
01:55:30.950 --> 01:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
myself I did not have a chance to look
 
01:55:32.510 --> 01:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
at that so that's why I was hoping you
 
01:55:35.069 --> 01:55:35.079 align:start position:0%
would know thank you representative
 
01:55:38.069 --> 01:55:38.079 align:start position:0%
licki thank you Mr chairman and this is
 
01:55:41.870 --> 01:55:41.880 align:start position:0%
a generalized U statement but I think
 
01:55:43.430 --> 01:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
there is an important distinction to be
 
01:55:48.189 --> 01:55:48.199 align:start position:0%
made between um sit uh situations where
 
01:55:49.790 --> 01:55:49.800 align:start position:0%
there is pollution there's you know
 
01:55:52.350 --> 01:55:52.360 align:start position:0%
definite results I know that I have um a
 
01:55:56.830 --> 01:55:56.840 align:start position:0%
trailer park and uh one or more ponds in
 
01:55:59.390 --> 01:55:59.400 align:start position:0%
my district where they're heavily
 
01:56:01.950 --> 01:56:01.960 align:start position:0%
thickly settled you know over you know
 
01:56:05.069 --> 01:56:05.079 align:start position:0%
beyond what um the septic systems can
 
01:56:07.790 --> 01:56:07.800 align:start position:0%
handle and in those cases I would see
 
01:56:10.229 --> 01:56:10.239 align:start position:0%
that a realistic reason for doing a for
 
01:56:12.629 --> 01:56:12.639 align:start position:0%
mandating that people connect but if
 
01:56:14.589 --> 01:56:14.599 align:start position:0%
you're talking about uh other rural
 
01:56:17.149 --> 01:56:17.159 align:start position:0%
areas where you know there's no
 
01:56:20.510 --> 01:56:20.520 align:start position:0%
pollution issue um then would seem to me
 
01:56:22.830 --> 01:56:22.840 align:start position:0%
not rural or even Suburban where there
 
01:56:24.750 --> 01:56:24.760 align:start position:0%
is no real reason to compel people to
 
01:56:30.069 --> 01:56:30.079 align:start position:0%
join AC septic uh sewage um dis plant
 
01:56:32.189 --> 01:56:32.199 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't cause a pollution
 
01:56:33.990 --> 01:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
problem and I would see a big
 
01:56:35.669 --> 01:56:35.679 align:start position:0%
distinction there between which you
 
01:56:37.790 --> 01:56:37.800 align:start position:0%
should mandate which you should
 
01:56:41.550 --> 01:56:41.560 align:start position:0%
not okay good point further discussion
 
01:56:44.510 --> 01:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
Vice chair Thomas thank you Mr chair U
 
01:56:47.550 --> 01:56:47.560 align:start position:0%
suly uh after hearing discussion here I
 
01:56:49.510 --> 01:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
agree this requires much more disc
 
01:56:51.589 --> 01:56:51.599 align:start position:0%
discussion and and look see before I can
 
01:56:55.149 --> 01:56:55.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:58.910 --> 01:56:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:01.669 --> 01:57:01.679 align:start position:0%
discussion we can discuss at exec
 
01:57:03.470 --> 01:57:03.480 align:start position:0%
session after I get some clarification
 
01:57:06.830 --> 01:57:06.840 align:start position:0%
from the clerk about their germanness of
 
01:57:09.030 --> 01:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
this amendment we can discuss whether we
 
01:57:09.040 --> 01:57:11.229 align:start position:0%
this amendment we can discuss whether we
want

01:57:11.229 --> 01:57:11.239 align:start position:0%
want
 
01:57:14.550 --> 01:57:14.560 align:start position:0%
to recess the executive session and hold
 
01:57:17.189 --> 01:57:17.199 align:start position:0%
another public hearing or whether we
 
01:57:20.149 --> 01:57:20.159 align:start position:0%
want to just itl the bill
 
01:57:22.430 --> 01:57:22.440 align:start position:0%
and say try again next
 
01:57:25.229 --> 01:57:25.239 align:start position:0%
time so we'll decide that at exec
 
01:57:27.470 --> 01:57:27.480 align:start position:0%
session any other
 
01:57:30.310 --> 01:57:30.320 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none okay let's take a
 
01:57:33.870 --> 01:57:33.880 align:start position:0%
a break here call this work session to a
 
01:57:36.669 --> 01:57:36.679 align:start position:0%
close and Republicans will please stay
 
01:57:39.910 --> 01:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
in the room as we will hold hold a
 
01:57:42.629 --> 01:57:42.639 align:start position:0%
caucus and then we will all reassemble
 
01:57:45.990 --> 01:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
here at 1:00 for exec session thank you
 
01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.390 align:start position:0%
here at 1:00 for exec session thank you
very

01:57:48.390 --> 01:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:48.400 --> 04:01:30.469 align:start position:0%
 
much

04:01:30.469 --> 04:01:30.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:32.149 --> 04:01:32.159 align:start position:0%
okay ladies and Gentlemen please take
 
04:01:34.510 --> 04:01:34.520 align:start position:0%
your seats and we will
 
04:01:38.710 --> 04:01:38.720 align:start position:0%
recommence stn activity for this Tuesday
 
04:01:42.990 --> 04:01:43.000 align:start position:0%
February 6th this afternoon we are going
 
04:01:47.070 --> 04:01:47.080 align:start position:0%
to have executive sessions on six bills

today and uh we uh I think we've said
 
04:03:41.630 --> 04:03:41.640 align:start position:0%
all all all that we can say this is a
 
04:03:44.229 --> 04:03:44.239 align:start position:0%
this is a start we know it's not a
 
04:03:46.389 --> 04:03:46.399 align:start position:0%
perfect bill but we know it's important
 
04:03:48.510 --> 04:03:48.520 align:start position:0%
enough for the timber industry that we
 
04:03:51.389 --> 04:03:51.399 align:start position:0%
get something going and establishing um
 
04:03:54.790 --> 04:03:54.800 align:start position:0%
uh a registry and doing an investigation

as to um uh what can be done to help out
 
04:03:58.870 --> 04:03:58.880 align:start position:0%
these towns I think it's important that
 
04:04:01.389 --> 04:04:01.399 align:start position:0%
that's what this amendment does so we
 
04:04:02.710 --> 04:04:02.720 align:start position:0%
need to adopt this
 
04:04:06.990 --> 04:04:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:07.000 --> 04:04:10.469 align:start position:0%

calendar oops has an FN although it no
 
04:06:03.229 --> 04:06:03.239 align:start position:0%
longer replies because that was to the

original bill
 
04:06:07.910 --> 04:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
but all right no consent then for the
 
04:06:10.790 --> 04:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
this one so this will go on the regular
 
04:06:13.309 --> 04:06:13.319 align:start position:0%
calendar representative Harrington yes
 
04:06:14.750 --> 04:06:14.760 align:start position:0%

bill yes we voted on both at the same
 
04:06:21.189 --> 04:06:21.199 align:start position:0%
time oh
 
04:06:23.910 --> 04:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
okay we
 
04:06:26.710 --> 04:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
did the motion was ought to pass as
 
04:06:33.429 --> 04:06:33.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:35.670 --> 04:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
0482 I I I thought we were voting on
 
04:06:38.149 --> 04:06:38.159 align:start position:0%
amendments separately and then then on
 
04:06:39.830 --> 04:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
the bills as
 
04:06:42.309 --> 04:06:42.319 align:start position:0%
amended the clerk says you can do it the
 
04:06:44.750 --> 04:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
way we did it I've had a lengthy
 
04:06:46.389 --> 04:06:46.399 align:start position:0%
discussion with him about it and he says
 
04:06:49.149 --> 04:06:49.159 align:start position:0%
that's acceptable he said particularly
 
04:06:52.550 --> 04:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
on bills where you know that the outcome
 
04:06:56.510 --> 04:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
is going to be uh non-controversial he
 
04:06:58.070 --> 04:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
says if the outcome is going to be
 
04:06:59.550 --> 04:06:59.560 align:start position:0%
controversial then you might want to do
 
04:07:03.269 --> 04:07:03.279 align:start position:0%
it separately so that's what we'll
 
04:07:05.750 --> 04:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
do all right so this bill will not go on
 
04:07:09.149 --> 04:07:09.159 align:start position:0%
the consent calendar but I will close
 
04:07:11.590 --> 04:07:11.600 align:start position:0%

04:09:58.990 --> 04:09:59.000 align:start position:0%
0438 H this one has no FN on it so I'm
 
04:10:00.910 --> 04:10:00.920 align:start position:0%
assuming we could move forward with
 
04:10:02.590 --> 04:10:02.600 align:start position:0%
putting this on the consent calendar is
 
04:10:05.030 --> 04:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
that correct any
 
04:10:07.229 --> 04:10:07.239 align:start position:0%
objection hearing no objections this
 
04:10:09.990 --> 04:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
bill will go on the consent calendar
 
04:10:13.149 --> 04:10:13.159 align:start position:0%
and representative Bernardi will write
 
04:10:16.349 --> 04:10:16.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:18.670 --> 04:10:18.680 align:start position:0%
report and with that we'll close the
 
04:10:24.229 --> 04:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:27.510 --> 04:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
1078 and if the committee will indulge
 
04:10:33.750 --> 04:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:36.429 --> 04:10:36.439 align:start position:0%
battery before we move
 
04:10:36.439 --> 04:11:01.990 align:start position:0%
battery before we move
on

04:11:01.990 --> 04:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:03.910 --> 04:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for indulging
 
04:11:07.870 --> 04:11:07.880 align:start position:0%
me I'll now open a executive session on
 
04:11:09.149 --> 04:11:09.159 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
04:11:13.309 --> 04:11:13.319 align:start position:0%
1472 dfn and recognize representative
 
04:11:15.469 --> 04:11:15.479 align:start position:0%
Harrington for a motion I move
 
04:11:17.269 --> 04:11:17.279 align:start position:0%
inappropriate to
 
04:11:19.550 --> 04:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
legislate inexpedient to legislate I'm
 
04:11:19.560 --> 04:11:21.269 align:start position:0%
legislate inexpedient to legislate I'm
sorry

04:11:21.269 --> 04:11:21.279 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
04:11:23.670 --> 04:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
itl I guess we now know how you really
 
04:11:26.229 --> 04:11:26.239 align:start position:0%
feel about this bill recognize
 
04:11:28.109 --> 04:11:28.119 align:start position:0%
representative liwicki I second the
 
04:11:32.149 --> 04:11:32.159 align:start position:0%
motion moved and seconded that we uh
 
04:11:36.149 --> 04:11:36.159 align:start position:0%
judge House Bill 1472 to be inexpedient
 
04:11:38.590 --> 04:11:38.600 align:start position:0%
to legislate further discussion
 
04:11:40.990 --> 04:11:41.000 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington well I think
 
04:11:42.469 --> 04:11:42.479 align:start position:0%
we talked this out pretty much in the
 
04:11:44.309 --> 04:11:44.319 align:start position:0%
work session we could talk on it for a
 
04:11:45.389 --> 04:11:45.399 align:start position:0%
few more hours but I don't think
 
04:11:46.790 --> 04:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
anyone's going to change their position
 
04:11:49.510 --> 04:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
so I'll just leave it at that further
 
04:11:51.790 --> 04:11:51.800 align:start position:0%
discussion on House Bill
 
04:11:54.790 --> 04:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
1472 representative
 
04:11:54.800 --> 04:11:56.910 align:start position:0%
1472 representative
Ms

04:11:56.910 --> 04:11:56.920 align:start position:0%
Ms
 
04:12:00.830 --> 04:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
um again I I I I agree with
 
04:12:02.309 --> 04:12:02.319 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington I don't think
 
04:12:04.429 --> 04:12:04.439 align:start position:0%
we're going to change anybody's mind but
 
04:12:07.710 --> 04:12:07.720 align:start position:0%
I did want to point out that uh
 
04:12:09.510 --> 04:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
following the discussion we had this
 
04:12:12.670 --> 04:12:12.680 align:start position:0%
morning um I did uh put in a request for
 
04:12:16.790 --> 04:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
an amendment to um reduce the income
 
04:12:19.750 --> 04:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
levels uh cut the income levels by
 
04:12:22.990 --> 04:12:23.000 align:start position:0%
half um and to uh make sure that there
 
04:12:25.750 --> 04:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
was language in the amendment that um
 
04:12:27.950 --> 04:12:27.960 align:start position:0%
specifically said that leases were
 
04:12:31.830 --> 04:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
included as part of the um would be that
 
04:12:34.630 --> 04:12:34.640 align:start position:0%
people uh people leasing cars would be
 
04:12:37.790 --> 04:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
eligible that amendment is over
 
04:12:41.830 --> 04:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
56h which I have passed around my hope
 
04:12:45.389 --> 04:12:45.399 align:start position:0%
would be that we would um vote against
 
04:12:47.469 --> 04:12:47.479 align:start position:0%
in expedient to legislate so that that
 
04:12:50.550 --> 04:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
Amendment could be considered and um we
 
04:12:53.990 --> 04:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
could um have a vote on that and and the
 
04:12:57.109 --> 04:12:57.119 align:start position:0%
bill is amended thank you okay further
 
04:13:02.670 --> 04:13:02.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:04.830 --> 04:13:04.840 align:start position:0%
1472 representative
 
04:13:07.910 --> 04:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
McGee you and I would just just like to
 
04:13:11.510 --> 04:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
ask uh ask for some leniency on this one
 
04:13:13.870 --> 04:13:13.880 align:start position:0%
since this was one that was up for exec
 
04:13:15.790 --> 04:13:15.800 align:start position:0%
last week when you guys didn't have a
 
04:13:15.800 --> 04:13:16.630 align:start position:0%
last week when you guys didn't have a
full

04:13:16.630 --> 04:13:16.640 align:start position:0%
full
 
04:13:19.429 --> 04:13:19.439 align:start position:0%
compliment um and you know we would have
 
04:13:21.109 --> 04:13:21.119 align:start position:0%
had an advantage then to at least get
 
04:13:22.750 --> 04:13:22.760 align:start position:0%
this to the house floor with something
 
04:13:26.510 --> 04:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
other than an itl so I would again Ask
 
04:13:28.590 --> 04:13:28.600 align:start position:0%
folks to vote against the itl so a
 
04:13:30.309 --> 04:13:30.319 align:start position:0%
different motion can be
 
04:13:35.790 --> 04:13:35.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:37.910 --> 04:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
discussion well since since we had an
 
04:13:40.109 --> 04:13:40.119 align:start position:0%
fairly extensive discussion on this uh
 
04:13:41.830 --> 04:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
this morning during our work session I
 
04:13:44.870 --> 04:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
guess we're content at this point to
 
04:13:46.870 --> 04:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
move on to a vote so I'll ask the clerk
 
04:13:50.149 --> 04:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
to call the role on the motion of itl on
 
04:13:52.910 --> 04:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:55.349 --> 04:13:55.359 align:start position:0%
1472 uh representative parshall you got
 
04:13:57.510 --> 04:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
to raise your hand a little higher yes
 
04:14:00.469 --> 04:14:00.479 align:start position:0%
I'm very sorry I'll do my best to be
 
04:14:05.109 --> 04:14:05.119 align:start position:0%
taller um I would hope that we could at
 
04:14:09.269 --> 04:14:09.279 align:start position:0%
least pass this bill as amended because
 
04:14:12.109 --> 04:14:12.119 align:start position:0%
I think that if we are going to put a
 
04:14:14.229 --> 04:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
bill before the floor we should put the
 
04:14:17.389 --> 04:14:17.399 align:start position:0%
best Bill possible before the floor and
 
04:14:19.950 --> 04:14:19.960 align:start position:0%
I think as amended reflects an
 
04:14:22.870 --> 04:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
improvement in this bill I would
 
04:14:25.830 --> 04:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
urge us to pass the bill as amended
 
04:14:28.910 --> 04:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
rather than uh voting on the original
 
04:14:31.469 --> 04:14:31.479 align:start position:0%
bill I would urge adopting the amendment
 
04:14:36.070 --> 04:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:36.080 --> 04:14:38.309 align:start position:0%

the chair's attention that it might go

1010 to the floor and as my friend uh
 
04:14:57.349 --> 04:14:57.359 align:start position:0%
representative Pell me
 
04:14:59.870 --> 04:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned this second Amendment is
 
04:15:02.830 --> 04:15:02.840 align:start position:0%
better than what we have now we didn't
 
04:15:05.469 --> 04:15:05.479 align:start position:0%
discuss the latest one from
 
04:15:09.790 --> 04:15:09.800 align:start position:0%

04:15:16.269 --> 04:15:16.279 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none I'll ask the
 
04:15:17.710 --> 04:15:17.720 align:start position:0%
clerk to call the role on the question
 
04:15:20.750 --> 04:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
of itl on House Bill

04:16:21.109 --> 04:16:21.119 align:start position:0%
uh excuse me chairman Vose yes 10
 
04:16:25.030 --> 04:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
10 as predicted by representative pl we
 
04:16:26.109 --> 04:16:26.119 align:start position:0%
have a
 
04:16:29.870 --> 04:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
1010 tie so the motion of itl
 
04:16:33.750 --> 04:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
fails and I'm going to suggest that any
 
04:16:36.309 --> 04:16:36.319 align:start position:0%
further motions would also fail and that
 
04:16:38.109 --> 04:16:38.119 align:start position:0%
we should just go go to the house floor
 
04:16:41.109 --> 04:16:41.119 align:start position:0%
without recommendation Mr chair may we
 
04:16:43.269 --> 04:16:43.279 align:start position:0%
may we take a vote representative McGee
 
04:16:45.830 --> 04:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
y may we take a vote on whether to amend
 
04:16:49.030 --> 04:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
uh would this minor Amendment which has
 
04:16:50.510 --> 04:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
been suggested might be an improvement
 
04:16:52.870 --> 04:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
to the bill before we go to the
 
04:16:55.910 --> 04:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
floor since the amendment is likely to
 
04:16:58.670 --> 04:16:58.680 align:start position:0%
fail with a 1010 vote I see no time no
 
04:17:01.590 --> 04:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
sense in wasting time doing
 
04:17:05.070 --> 04:17:05.080 align:start position:0%
that unless the committee tells me that
 
04:17:07.790 --> 04:17:07.800 align:start position:0%
they strongly feel that we need to do
 
04:17:10.670 --> 04:17:10.680 align:start position:0%
this by more than 10 to
 
04:17:14.030 --> 04:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
10 representative Corman thank you uh
 
04:17:16.349 --> 04:17:16.359 align:start position:0%
Ian maybe I don't understand the process
 
04:17:18.710 --> 04:17:18.720 align:start position:0%
fully but it seems to me that we could
 
04:17:22.070 --> 04:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
vote on the amendment and then if the
 
04:17:26.389 --> 04:17:26.399 align:start position:0%
amendment passes we could have a vote on
 
04:17:28.750 --> 04:17:28.760 align:start position:0%
otpa if the amendment passes but the
 
04:17:31.510 --> 04:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
otpa vote is 1010 then the bill would go
 
04:17:34.710 --> 04:17:34.720 align:start position:0%
to the floor with otpa and the amendment
 
04:17:36.469 --> 04:17:36.479 align:start position:0%
so I would I would request that we vote
 
04:17:38.950 --> 04:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
on the Amendment if the amendment fails
 
04:17:41.070 --> 04:17:41.080 align:start position:0%
I'm fine with dropping it but I feel
 
04:17:44.149 --> 04:17:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:46.030 --> 04:17:46.040 align:start position:0%
amendment further
 
04:17:48.590 --> 04:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
04:17:51.590 --> 04:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
Thomas just chiming in to say that I uh
 
04:17:53.990 --> 04:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
strongly agree with my uh colleague
 
04:17:57.109 --> 04:17:57.119 align:start position:0%
representative Corman representative
 
04:18:00.030 --> 04:18:00.040 align:start position:0%
Bernardi I I would suggest a floor
 
04:18:05.550 --> 04:18:05.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:09.070 --> 04:18:09.080 align:start position:0%
forward by Mr chair Thomas uh yes Mr
 
04:18:11.910 --> 04:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
chair uh I
 
04:18:15.550 --> 04:18:15.560 align:start position:0%
although the amendment reduces some
 
04:18:18.870 --> 04:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
dollar figure uh it doesn't um address
 
04:18:21.550 --> 04:18:21.560 align:start position:0%
the point that um I think the basic
 
04:18:23.950 --> 04:18:23.960 align:start position:0%
point of the entire bill so um I
 
04:18:25.149 --> 04:18:25.159 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be voting for the amendment
 
04:18:31.229 --> 04:18:31.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:35.149 --> 04:18:35.159 align:start position:0%
way representative F uh thank you chair
 
04:18:37.030 --> 04:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
yes I was thinking about the amendment
 
04:18:39.630 --> 04:18:39.640 align:start position:0%
and representative Bernardi had
 
04:18:41.469 --> 04:18:41.479 align:start position:0%
mentioned that there is still available
 
04:18:44.710 --> 04:18:44.720 align:start position:0%
floor Amendment so I think that would be
 
04:18:47.469 --> 04:18:47.479 align:start position:0%
the best way just continue what we
 
04:18:50.750 --> 04:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
have okay further
 
04:18:53.550 --> 04:18:53.560 align:start position:0%

04:19:24.750 --> 04:19:24.760 align:start position:0%
okay so representative buns please have
 
04:19:27.389 --> 04:19:27.399 align:start position:0%

04:19:30.269 --> 04:19:30.279 align:start position:0%
the building today I'd appreciate that
 
04:19:31.510 --> 04:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
and with that we're going to close the
 
04:19:35.469 --> 04:19:35.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:40.229 --> 04:19:40.239 align:start position:0%

relative to rebates of Energy Efficiency
 
04:19:50.750 --> 04:19:50.760 align:start position:0%

itl chair recognizes representative
 
04:20:06.309 --> 04:20:06.319 align:start position:0%
Kennedy I second the motion moved in
 
04:20:10.070 --> 04:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
second Ed that we itl House Bill 1487
 
04:20:12.389 --> 04:20:12.399 align:start position:0%
relative to the health effects of 5G
 
04:20:15.630 --> 04:20:15.640 align:start position:0%
technology discussion representative
 
04:20:18.830 --> 04:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
Vice chair Thomas uh as was extensively
 
04:20:20.750 --> 04:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
um brief this morning during work
 
04:20:24.389 --> 04:20:24.399 align:start position:0%
session um no really new information was
 
04:20:27.070 --> 04:20:27.080 align:start position:0%
given uh for the Third Edition of this
 
04:20:30.830 --> 04:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
bill and prior bills and uh commissions
 
04:20:34.510 --> 04:20:34.520 align:start position:0%
and studies um were inconclusive as to
 
04:20:38.349 --> 04:20:38.359 align:start position:0%
cause and effect and and therefore uh in
 
04:20:39.870 --> 04:20:39.880 align:start position:0%
this bill in particular being all over
 
04:20:42.510 --> 04:20:42.520 align:start position:0%
the place we felt that it just was not a
 
04:20:45.630 --> 04:20:45.640 align:start position:0%
workable Bill thus
 
04:20:49.309 --> 04:20:49.319 align:start position:0%
itl in addition to Vice chair
 
04:20:52.349 --> 04:20:52.359 align:start position:0%
Thomas's uh very good reasons for iing
 
04:20:55.109 --> 04:20:55.119 align:start position:0%
this bill it must be pointed out that
 
04:20:56.790 --> 04:20:56.800 align:start position:0%
this bill wants to spend a fair amount
 
04:20:59.910 --> 04:20:59.920 align:start position:0%
of money but appropriates zero money to
 
04:20:59.920 --> 04:21:00.790 align:start position:0%
of money but appropriates zero money to
do

04:21:00.790 --> 04:21:00.800 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:21:05.030 --> 04:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
that making it unworkable as it's filed
 
04:21:07.590 --> 04:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
representative MS
 
04:21:11.309 --> 04:21:11.319 align:start position:0%
um I I will be voting um yes on the itl
 
04:21:16.710 --> 04:21:16.720 align:start position:0%
motion um um but I I I do believe that
 
04:21:20.189 --> 04:21:20.199 align:start position:0%
the the issues or the concerns that the
 
04:21:22.950 --> 04:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
bill is attempting to address are
 
04:21:25.550 --> 04:21:25.560 align:start position:0%
concerns that we should take
 
04:21:27.750 --> 04:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
seriously um there was a lot of work
 
04:21:29.990 --> 04:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
done by the commission that looked into
 
04:21:34.750 --> 04:21:34.760 align:start position:0%
this um and um I think some of the
 
04:21:37.109 --> 04:21:37.119 align:start position:0%
recommendations that the the commission
 
04:21:40.189 --> 04:21:40.199 align:start position:0%
included are worth implementing but the
 
04:21:43.229 --> 04:21:43.239 align:start position:0%
bill as it's written um has a lot of
 
04:21:45.590 --> 04:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
issues and concern and has a lot of
 
04:21:47.269 --> 04:21:47.279 align:start position:0%
issues and I have concerns with it
 
04:21:50.149 --> 04:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
particularly the language that would um
 
04:21:55.070 --> 04:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
Force um school districts to um move
 
04:21:58.469 --> 04:21:58.479 align:start position:0%
from wireless internet um which is um
 
04:22:00.469 --> 04:22:00.479 align:start position:0%
way too it's way too premature to be
 
04:22:04.030 --> 04:22:04.040 align:start position:0%
doing that right now so um I hope that
 
04:22:07.990 --> 04:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
um a bill that um
 
04:22:09.550 --> 04:22:09.560 align:start position:0%
uh tries to move forward some of the
 
04:22:11.189 --> 04:22:11.199 align:start position:0%
recommendations by the commission can be
 
04:22:13.510 --> 04:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
introduced at a future date but this
 
04:22:15.429 --> 04:22:15.439 align:start position:0%
bill is not the right
 
04:22:19.309 --> 04:22:19.319 align:start position:0%
vehicle Vice chair Thomas thank you m uh
 
04:22:21.630 --> 04:22:21.640 align:start position:0%
yes I totally agree with representative
 
04:22:24.229 --> 04:22:24.239 align:start position:0%
Ms in terms of the fact that uh there
 
04:22:25.870 --> 04:22:25.880 align:start position:0%
are people out there we fully
 
04:22:28.750 --> 04:22:28.760 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that they are suffering from
 
04:22:31.990 --> 04:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
certain ailments um there could be
 
04:22:33.910 --> 04:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
correlation to being near
 
04:22:37.670 --> 04:22:37.680 align:start position:0%
electromagnetic waves but extensive
 
04:22:40.229 --> 04:22:40.239 align:start position:0%
commissions and Studies have yet to
 
04:22:42.149 --> 04:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
prove conclusively whether there's a
 
04:22:45.149 --> 04:22:45.159 align:start position:0%
cause effect there and although we uh we
 
04:22:47.109 --> 04:22:47.119 align:start position:0%
would like to be able to do something
 
04:22:50.030 --> 04:22:50.040 align:start position:0%
we're just not exactly sure what it is
 
04:22:51.990 --> 04:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
and particularly this bill goes way too
 
04:22:54.910 --> 04:22:54.920 align:start position:0%
far in in doing a solution on something
 
04:22:57.309 --> 04:22:57.319 align:start position:0%
that we don't even know exactly uh what
 
04:22:58.870 --> 04:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
what the real is uh you know reason is
 
04:23:01.790 --> 04:23:01.800 align:start position:0%
for it yet so uh with with that in mind
 
04:23:03.189 --> 04:23:03.199 align:start position:0%
that's my
 
04:23:05.269 --> 04:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
rationale further
 
04:23:05.279 --> 04:23:07.070 align:start position:0%

parshall thank you chair I'd like to

Echo uh my colleagues uh remarks both of
 
04:23:16.830 --> 04:23:16.840 align:start position:0%
them actually there is a lack of good
 
04:23:18.950 --> 04:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
science out there I feel and with a lack
 
04:23:20.870 --> 04:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
of good science mythology tends to come
 
04:23:23.910 --> 04:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
out um but I am fully supportive of the
 
04:23:26.109 --> 04:23:26.119 align:start position:0%
spirit of the bill I will be voting to

1487 I'm
 
04:24:54.510 --> 04:24:54.520 align:start position:0%
guessing excuse me I'm guessing that if
 
04:24:57.030 --> 04:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
we put this on consent somebody will
 
04:25:00.030 --> 04:25:00.040 align:start position:0%
pull it off so
 
04:25:02.830 --> 04:25:02.840 align:start position:0%
I'm still put it on consent all right
 
04:25:05.070 --> 04:25:05.080 align:start position:0%
we'll put it on consent I need 10 all
 
04:25:05.080 --> 04:25:06.950 align:start position:0%
we'll put it on consent I need 10 all
right

04:25:06.950 --> 04:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:25:06.960 --> 04:25:09.309 align:start position:0%
right
I'm

04:25:09.309 --> 04:25:09.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:12.469 --> 04:25:12.479 align:start position:0%
easy so House Bill 1487 will go on the
 
04:25:12.479 --> 04:25:15.510 align:start position:0%
easy so House Bill 1487 will go on the
consent

04:25:15.510 --> 04:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:18.109 --> 04:25:18.119 align:start position:0%
calendar and with that we'll close the
 
04:25:21.550 --> 04:25:21.560 align:start position:0%
executive session on House Bill 1487 who
 
04:25:24.429 --> 04:25:24.439 align:start position:0%
is writing the report the report will be
 
04:25:27.950 --> 04:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
written by representative Vice chair
 
04:25:33.510 --> 04:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:37.030 --> 04:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
it okay so next up let's open an exec
 
04:25:39.990 --> 04:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill 1508 and the chair
 
04:25:41.990 --> 04:25:42.000 align:start position:0%

bney thank you chair uh I move interm
 
04:25:47.269 --> 04:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
study on HB
 
04:25:50.229 --> 04:25:50.239 align:start position:0%
1508 and I will second that motion so
 
04:25:52.670 --> 04:25:52.680 align:start position:0%
it's been moved and seconded that
 
04:25:55.790 --> 04:25:55.800 align:start position:0%
we adopt the motion of refer for interim
 
04:25:58.510 --> 04:25:58.520 align:start position:0%
study on House Bill
 
04:26:01.469 --> 04:26:01.479 align:start position:0%

04:26:13.030 --> 04:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
this interim study recommendation was
 
04:26:17.389 --> 04:26:17.399 align:start position:0%
actually the uh stated preference of the
 
04:26:20.269 --> 04:26:20.279 align:start position:0%
Bill's sponsor and I think it's uh our
 
04:26:23.670 --> 04:26:23.680 align:start position:0%
duty to honor that request by moving
 
04:26:26.590 --> 04:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
this bill into interim study and
 
04:26:29.710 --> 04:26:29.720 align:start position:0%
representative VI Vice chair Thomas also
 
04:26:32.269 --> 04:26:32.279 align:start position:0%
feels that interim study is appropriate
 
04:26:34.870 --> 04:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
I'll let him explain why uh yes thank
 
04:26:37.149 --> 04:26:37.159 align:start position:0%
you uh for the reason just mentioned
 
04:26:40.550 --> 04:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
plus uh I feel there is something there
 
04:26:43.149 --> 04:26:43.159 align:start position:0%
when a public official involving
 
04:26:45.710 --> 04:26:45.720 align:start position:0%
security and safety such as a police
 
04:26:49.750 --> 04:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
chief can't get to the right person
 
04:26:52.910 --> 04:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
immediately to try and solve a problem
 
04:26:54.990 --> 04:26:55.000 align:start position:0%
uh when it comes to Public Safety and
 
04:26:57.389 --> 04:26:57.399 align:start position:0%
Communications in my opinion whether
 
04:27:01.189 --> 04:27:01.199 align:start position:0%
you're a police chief fire chief U or
 
04:27:03.510 --> 04:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
other first responder that needs
 
04:27:05.469 --> 04:27:05.479 align:start position:0%
immediate assistance on something that
 
04:27:08.429 --> 04:27:08.439 align:start position:0%
is CR IAL there ought to be a point of
 
04:27:11.630 --> 04:27:11.640 align:start position:0%
contact that they can call to handle a
 
04:27:14.189 --> 04:27:14.199 align:start position:0%
particular unusual situation in this
 
04:27:15.910 --> 04:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
case there didn't seem to be there
 
04:27:18.670 --> 04:27:18.680 align:start position:0%
wasn't any and therefore I think inim
 
04:27:21.469 --> 04:27:21.479 align:start position:0%
study might present some discussions on
 
04:27:23.830 --> 04:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
how uh these people can be better served
 
04:27:26.269 --> 04:27:26.279 align:start position:0%
in the future should a similar situation
 
04:27:28.790 --> 04:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
come up uh such as it did and for that
 
04:27:31.309 --> 04:27:31.319 align:start position:0%
reason I think inum study has some
 
04:27:34.790 --> 04:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
value further discussion on the motion
 
04:27:36.870 --> 04:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
representative nter
 
04:27:39.349 --> 04:27:39.359 align:start position:0%
after hearing your um reasoning I'm
 
04:27:42.149 --> 04:27:42.159 align:start position:0%
going to go along with the interm study
 
04:27:43.269 --> 04:27:43.279 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
04:27:49.389 --> 04:27:49.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:51.389 --> 04:27:51.399 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none I'll ask the
 
04:27:53.510 --> 04:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
clerk to call the role on the motion of
 
04:27:57.389 --> 04:27:57.399 align:start position:0%

adopts the motion of itl on House Bill I

mean I refer to is I'm sorry on House
Bill

04:29:09.830 --> 04:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
04:29:12.510 --> 04:29:12.520 align:start position:0%
1508 and this too I believe can go on
 
04:29:15.229 --> 04:29:15.239 align:start position:0%
the consent calendar without
 
04:29:17.790 --> 04:29:17.800 align:start position:0%
objection no objection so it goes on
 
04:29:21.070 --> 04:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
consent and the
 
04:29:24.189 --> 04:29:24.199 align:start position:0%
um calendar report will be written by
 
04:29:27.750 --> 04:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:30.189 --> 04:29:30.199 align:start position:0%
bne and he will attempt to have that
 
04:29:33.670 --> 04:29:33.680 align:start position:0%
before he leaves here today correct good
 
04:29:35.429 --> 04:29:35.439 align:start position:0%
all right so that we'll close the exec
 
04:29:36.990 --> 04:29:37.000 align:start position:0%
session on
 
04:29:40.349 --> 04:29:40.359 align:start position:0%
1508 and we're now down to the last bill
 
04:29:45.109 --> 04:29:45.119 align:start position:0%
on our list House Bill 1576 FN relative
 
04:29:48.070 --> 04:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
to allowing Property Owners to opt out
 
04:29:51.189 --> 04:29:51.199 align:start position:0%
of Public Utilities and I will make a
 
04:29:55.429 --> 04:29:55.439 align:start position:0%
motion of itl and recognize Vice chair
 
04:29:58.670 --> 04:29:58.680 align:start position:0%
Thomas second it's been moved and
 
04:30:00.510 --> 04:30:00.520 align:start position:0%
seconded that
 
04:30:03.389 --> 04:30:03.399 align:start position:0%
we move that this bill judge that this
 
04:30:06.630 --> 04:30:06.640 align:start position:0%
bill is worthy of it
 
04:30:09.990 --> 04:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
the reason I made this motion is
 
04:30:12.670 --> 04:30:12.680 align:start position:0%
because the amendment that was supplied
 
04:30:15.550 --> 04:30:15.560 align:start position:0%
to us and that we discussed earlier
 
04:30:17.710 --> 04:30:17.720 align:start position:0%
today in our work
 
04:30:20.309 --> 04:30:20.319 align:start position:0%
session did not seem to
 
04:30:22.910 --> 04:30:22.920 align:start position:0%
be an amendment that was well thought
 
04:30:26.189 --> 04:30:26.199 align:start position:0%
out an amendment that was practical an
 
04:30:27.990 --> 04:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
amendment that would be
 
04:30:31.070 --> 04:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
effective and since it was a complete
 
04:30:33.910 --> 04:30:33.920 align:start position:0%
rewrite of the original bill it seems
 
04:30:35.630 --> 04:30:35.640 align:start position:0%
that while this subject may be worth
 
04:30:38.429 --> 04:30:38.439 align:start position:0%
worthy of further
 
04:30:41.950 --> 04:30:41.960 align:start position:0%
attention its treatment by this bill and
 
04:30:44.790 --> 04:30:44.800 align:start position:0%
by the accompanying Amendment just were
 
04:30:47.189 --> 04:30:47.199 align:start position:0%
not up to the task of solving the
 
04:30:49.670 --> 04:30:49.680 align:start position:0%
problem that the bill tried to solve so
 
04:30:53.630 --> 04:30:53.640 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm um moving itl and I'll be
 
04:30:55.750 --> 04:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
interested to hear how the rest of the
 
04:30:55.760 --> 04:30:56.950 align:start position:0%
interested to hear how the rest of the
committee

04:30:56.950 --> 04:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:31:00.469 --> 04:31:00.479 align:start position:0%
feels representative Thomas thank you Mr
 
04:31:04.389 --> 04:31:04.399 align:start position:0%
chair um I agree with you I I I'm going
 
04:31:06.550 --> 04:31:06.560 align:start position:0%
to vote itl on this however um you were
 
04:31:08.830 --> 04:31:08.840 align:start position:0%
going to check with the clerk about the
 
04:31:10.429 --> 04:31:10.439 align:start position:0%
amendment whether or not it was Germaine
 
04:31:12.510 --> 04:31:12.520 align:start position:0%
or not did you check with the clerk and
 
04:31:15.189 --> 04:31:15.199 align:start position:0%
just if if so what was the result I sent
 
04:31:18.910 --> 04:31:18.920 align:start position:0%
him an email I did not go back over to
 
04:31:21.630 --> 04:31:21.640 align:start position:0%
his office uh because we had already
 
04:31:24.510 --> 04:31:24.520 align:start position:0%
decided before lunch that itl was the
 
04:31:26.870 --> 04:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
proper motion so I can't answer that
 
04:31:28.590 --> 04:31:28.600 align:start position:0%
question I didn't see a reply from him
 
04:31:28.600 --> 04:31:30.870 align:start position:0%
question I didn't see a reply from him
in

04:31:30.870 --> 04:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:31:33.429 --> 04:31:33.439 align:start position:0%
email additional discussion
 
04:31:36.149 --> 04:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
representative Corman thank you uh so I
 
04:31:38.550 --> 04:31:38.560 align:start position:0%
agree with with your points and and to
 
04:31:41.070 --> 04:31:41.080 align:start position:0%
them I would add that if another bill
 
04:31:44.149 --> 04:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
comes forward about this particular
 
04:31:46.229 --> 04:31:46.239 align:start position:0%
topic then it would probably go to the
 
04:31:47.990 --> 04:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate committee for that topic
 
04:31:50.189 --> 04:31:50.199 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
04:31:54.710 --> 04:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
st&amp; likely at least we can hope further
 
04:31:57.269 --> 04:31:57.279 align:start position:0%
discussion representative McGee thank
 
04:31:58.790 --> 04:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I think the last thing I
 
04:32:01.149 --> 04:32:01.159 align:start position:0%
would say on it is that I felt that the
 
04:32:02.790 --> 04:32:02.800 align:start position:0%
testimony the questions that we got to
 
04:32:04.910 --> 04:32:04.920 align:start position:0%
ask during the work session sealed it
 
04:32:07.189 --> 04:32:07.199 align:start position:0%
for me because it sounded like it would
 
04:32:09.469 --> 04:32:09.479 align:start position:0%
maybe cause more problems than it solved
 
04:32:11.630 --> 04:32:11.640 align:start position:0%
so I don't think it was well focused
 
04:32:13.550 --> 04:32:13.560 align:start position:0%
enough for us to be passing it into law
 
04:32:14.830 --> 04:32:14.840 align:start position:0%
at this
 
04:32:17.790 --> 04:32:17.800 align:start position:0%
point further discussion representative
 
04:32:20.030 --> 04:32:20.040 align:start position:0%
nter and this is the first time we ever
 
04:32:21.870 --> 04:32:21.880 align:start position:0%
had to discuss sewage in this committee
 
04:32:25.510 --> 04:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
so I agree that it belongs in another
 
04:32:27.269 --> 04:32:27.279 align:start position:0%
committee you don't want to get your
 
04:32:30.630 --> 04:32:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:32.950 --> 04:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
it representative partiall don't forget
 
04:32:34.429 --> 04:32:34.439 align:start position:0%
to turn off your mic when you're done
 
04:32:34.439 --> 04:32:36.070 align:start position:0%
to turn off your mic when you're done
speaking

04:32:36.070 --> 04:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
speaking
 
04:32:38.030 --> 04:32:38.040 align:start position:0%
any further
 
04:32:40.070 --> 04:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none I'll ask the
 
04:32:41.630 --> 04:32:41.640 align:start position:0%
clerk to call the role on the motion of
 
04:32:46.630 --> 04:32:46.640 align:start position:0%

20 by a vote of 20 to nothing the
 
04:33:47.629 --> 04:33:47.639 align:start position:0%
committee adopts the motion of itl for
 
04:33:49.029 --> 04:33:49.039 align:start position:0%

1576
 
04:33:55.510 --> 04:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
FN giving us uh five bills today
 
04:33:59.189 --> 04:33:59.199 align:start position:0%
that were adopted with a vote of 20 to
 
04:34:02.390 --> 04:34:02.400 align:start position:0%
nothing which I think is U quite
 
04:34:04.590 --> 04:34:04.600 align:start position:0%
remarkable for our committee the other
 
04:34:06.709 --> 04:34:06.719 align:start position:0%
bill was 10 10 and that will go to the
 
04:34:09.551 --> 04:34:09.561 align:start position:0%
floor without recommendation but um we
 
04:34:11.709 --> 04:34:11.719 align:start position:0%
did reach consensus on five bills so I
 
04:34:14.750 --> 04:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for that sir and that will go
 
04:34:16.709 --> 04:34:16.719 align:start position:0%
on consent as
 
04:34:16.719 --> 04:34:18.590 align:start position:0%
on consent as
well

04:34:18.590 --> 04:34:18.600 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:34:22.310 --> 04:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
that that was the original Bill
 
04:34:24.789 --> 04:34:24.799 align:start position:0%
though not put on
 
04:34:27.310 --> 04:34:27.320 align:start position:0%
consent all right so we won't put that
 
04:34:29.150 --> 04:34:29.160 align:start position:0%
one on consent just because of the FN
 
04:34:29.160 --> 04:34:30.551 align:start position:0%
one on consent just because of the FN
but

04:34:30.551 --> 04:34:30.561 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:34:33.910 --> 04:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
um it won't matter anyway because the
 
04:34:35.910 --> 04:34:35.920 align:start position:0%
house will adopt the itl motion I'm
 
04:34:38.269 --> 04:34:38.279 align:start position:0%
pretty sure and finance will never see
 
04:34:40.949 --> 04:34:40.959 align:start position:0%
it which I'm sure we be happy and who
 
04:34:42.830 --> 04:34:42.840 align:start position:0%
who's writing the report I will write
 
04:34:42.840 --> 04:34:44.189 align:start position:0%
who's writing the report I will write
the

04:34:44.189 --> 04:34:44.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:34:46.510 --> 04:34:46.520 align:start position:0%
report uh for
 
04:34:49.709 --> 04:34:49.719 align:start position:0%
that as a matter of fact I already have
 
04:34:51.470 --> 04:34:51.480 align:start position:0%
but I'm going to have to change it
 
04:34:54.470 --> 04:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
because the report I wrote was different
 
04:34:55.750 --> 04:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
okay so we're going to we're going to
 
04:34:57.869 --> 04:34:57.879 align:start position:0%

good and save us a trip the week after
