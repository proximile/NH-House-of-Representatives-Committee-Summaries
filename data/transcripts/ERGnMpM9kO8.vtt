committee members for attending those

meetings i think everybody attended at
 
00:27:49.669 --> 00:27:49.679 align:start position:0%
least one and there are some members
 
00:27:50.789 --> 00:27:50.799 align:start position:0%
here who
 
00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
attended everyone
 
00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:54.240 align:start position:0%

00:28:02.549 --> 00:28:02.559 align:start position:0%
because there were some long drives
 
00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
there um i have a few extras here they
 
00:28:08.389 --> 00:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
were passed out originally
 
00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
but i understand people may not have
 
00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
them they are to be submitted to the
 
00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
speaker's office for reimbursement
 
00:28:18.389 --> 00:28:18.399 align:start position:0%
representative weber
 
00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair that was the first
 
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
thing that you would ask me to remind
 
00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
you of but you got to it before i did i
 
00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
also wanted to ask that um our records
 
00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
include the letter that i submitted
 
00:28:32.389 --> 00:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
there's a copy to each of you
 
00:28:36.149 --> 00:28:36.159 align:start position:0%
on your desks it is from
 
00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
uh and i'm submitting it as a member of
 
00:28:40.549 --> 00:28:40.559 align:start position:0%
the committee and as ranking member of
 
00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:42.240 align:start position:0%
health human services and elderly
 
00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
affairs it's a letter to the speaker
 
00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
from 25. i am aware of your organization
 
00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative and i would
 
00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:50.320 align:start position:0%
just like it to be part of our records
 
00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:52.480 align:start position:0%
as well as uh in the speakers i don't
 
00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:54.640 align:start position:0%
know why it would be part of our records
 
00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
i think that opens up every committee
 
00:28:59.110 --> 00:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
member to submit anything that is
 
00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
submitted to the speaker of the house
 
00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
i appreciate your concern with the
 
00:29:07.269 --> 00:29:07.279 align:start position:0%
issues raised but it is not addressed to
 
00:29:09.269 --> 00:29:09.279 align:start position:0%
the committee it does not reference the
 
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
committee it is a letter to the speaker
 
00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:14.240 align:start position:0%
and it is signed by a number of
 
00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:16.070 align:start position:0%
and it is signed by a number of
individuals

00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
00:29:19.029 --> 00:29:19.039 align:start position:0%
i suspect many of whom are not even from
 
00:29:19.039 --> 00:29:19.990 align:start position:0%
i suspect many of whom are not even from
new

00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
new
 
00:29:22.149 --> 00:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
from they look like most of them are
 
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
from new hampshire
 
00:29:26.389 --> 00:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
and i have no personal knowledge as to
 
00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
why this would be part of the record so
 
00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:31.279 align:start position:0%
i am going to decline the request to
 
00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
make it part of the public record of
 
00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
this committee you have referenced it
 
00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
and it will of course be has been
 
00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:40.640 align:start position:0%
submitted to the speaker thank you for
 
00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:42.640 align:start position:0%
bringing it to our attention
 
00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
i i would then just ask that
 
00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
we all think very clearly about
 
00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
the requests made therein because they
 
00:29:53.029 --> 00:29:53.039 align:start position:0%
are the same as requests made by many
 
00:29:55.029 --> 00:29:55.039 align:start position:0%
many many of our citizens so i thought
 
00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
adding the extra voices in
 
00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
would be useful to the committee thank
 
00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
in regards to
 
00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
public requests i just wanted to see if
 
00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:10.240 align:start position:0%
any members had anything
 
00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
specific in regards to the public input
 
00:30:16.549 --> 00:30:16.559 align:start position:0%
sessions other than the issues of access
 
00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
quite frankly because those have been
 
00:30:20.549 --> 00:30:20.559 align:start position:0%
raised repeatedly and i don't think they
 
00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
need to be raised
 
00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
again but as to the issues before us on
 
00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:28.149 align:start position:0%
again but as to the issues before us on
redistricting

00:30:28.149 --> 00:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
redistricting
 
00:30:30.389 --> 00:30:30.399 align:start position:0%
did any members have anything in
 
00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
particular they wanted to raise for the
 
00:30:33.909 --> 00:30:33.919 align:start position:0%
committee this morning i'm sure some a
 
00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:35.440 align:start position:0%
lot of it will come up as we discuss
 
00:30:40.149 --> 00:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
representative lane
 
00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:44.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for those sessions i was not
 
00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
able to attend personally i watched them
 
00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
on streaming and i can tell you i don't
 
00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
know if anybody else has watched them
 
00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
it's really hard to hear some of the
 
00:30:54.149 --> 00:30:54.159 align:start position:0%
speakers and what they're saying so as
 
00:30:56.389 --> 00:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
we have additional hearings
 
00:30:58.630 --> 00:30:58.640 align:start position:0%
we need to really remind them to speak
 
00:31:00.789 --> 00:31:00.799 align:start position:0%
up because if people are watching
 
00:31:02.389 --> 00:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
it's really hard to hear and it's hard
 
00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
to hear the members too yeah the and we
 
00:31:06.789 --> 00:31:06.799 align:start position:0%
we were dealing with different
 
00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
microphones in every setting so
 
00:31:10.549 --> 00:31:10.559 align:start position:0%
hopefully going forward we're going to
 
00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:12.320 align:start position:0%
have microphones we're all more familiar
 
00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
with so we'll be able to deal with that
 
00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:15.909 align:start position:0%
with so we'll be able to deal with that
better

00:31:15.909 --> 00:31:15.919 align:start position:0%
better
 
00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
um one of the things i did want to talk
 
00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
about because i think it was mentioned
 
00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:22.640 align:start position:0%
at every public setting was the website
 
00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
i want to make sure committee members
 
00:31:28.789 --> 00:31:28.799 align:start position:0%
are going on the website to check input
 
00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
i've gone through it to just review it i
 
00:31:33.029 --> 00:31:33.039 align:start position:0%
did not make copies of the website
 
00:31:34.789 --> 00:31:34.799 align:start position:0%
submissions for everybody but i just
 
00:31:37.029 --> 00:31:37.039 align:start position:0%
wanted to go through it so committee
 
00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
members remain aware of what's going on
 
00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
and the public does also
 
00:31:45.029 --> 00:31:45.039 align:start position:0%
in regards to submission of testimony to
 
00:31:47.269 --> 00:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
the committee that can be written or
 
00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
files map files it does say very clearly
 
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
on the website that the files need to be
 
00:31:53.909 --> 00:31:53.919 align:start position:0%
in a pdf format
 
00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
there have been some problems uploading
 
00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:57.190 align:start position:0%
there have been some problems uploading
hopefully

00:31:57.190 --> 00:31:57.200 align:start position:0%
hopefully
 
00:31:59.029 --> 00:31:59.039 align:start position:0%
any problems have been resolved and
 
00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
clarification that it needs to be pdf
 
00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:04.880 align:start position:0%
has resolved them there is a location
 
00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
for general testimony
 
00:32:09.269 --> 00:32:09.279 align:start position:0%
as of yesterday at 4 30 and that's
 
00:32:11.509 --> 00:32:11.519 align:start position:0%
that's when i have the data from there
 
00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
had been 40 submissions to the general
 
00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
testimony link of course people have
 
00:32:20.149 --> 00:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
comments that relate to all
 
00:32:23.669 --> 00:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
of the mapping endeavors we're taking on
 
00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
and you heard that in the sessions
 
00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:30.640 align:start position:0%
there is also a link for hb 51 this
 
00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
deals with state senate districts
 
00:32:36.549 --> 00:32:36.559 align:start position:0%
our public input sessions were joint
 
00:32:39.269 --> 00:32:39.279 align:start position:0%
sessions with the senate as of 4 30
 
00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
yesterday afternoon there had been a
 
00:32:43.669 --> 00:32:43.679 align:start position:0%
total of three submissions now this is
 
00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
the house website so i am not
 
00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
particularly surprised by that i would
 
00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
expect that people that had specific
 
00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
comments might be commenting to the
 
00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:52.950 align:start position:0%
comments might be commenting to the
senate

00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
senate
 
00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
as we've discussed i expect those maps
 
00:32:58.230 --> 00:32:58.240 align:start position:0%
to be done in the first instance by the

eight
 
00:33:21.029 --> 00:33:21.039 align:start position:0%
comments sometimes it's hard for me to
 
00:33:24.789 --> 00:33:24.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:27.269 --> 00:33:27.279 align:start position:0%
on this particular website you would
 
00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity
 
00:33:31.269 --> 00:33:31.279 align:start position:0%
website link you will have the
 
00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity to see submitted maps there
 
00:33:36.549 --> 00:33:36.559 align:start position:0%
is one submitted map on the senate site
 
00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
there are four submitted maps on the hb
 
00:33:43.029 --> 00:33:43.039 align:start position:0%
52 link
 
00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:46.240 align:start position:0%
those do include the mapathon a handout
 
00:33:48.789 --> 00:33:48.799 align:start position:0%
that members received at an earlier
 
00:33:48.799 --> 00:33:51.110 align:start position:0%
that members received at an earlier
meeting

00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
hb 53 deals with executive council
 
00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
districts there have been three comments
 
00:33:59.430 --> 00:33:59.440 align:start position:0%
on that site and again
 
00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh there is one submission that contains
 
00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:04.240 align:start position:0%
maps and that would be the mapathon
 
00:34:07.509 --> 00:34:07.519 align:start position:0%
submission that this committee has seen
 
00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
and then h.b 54 for county commissioners
 
00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
had two comments as of yesterday and
 
00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
actually did have a map submission for
 
00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
one of our counties
 
00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:21.200 align:start position:0%
and as i'm doing this it looks like i
 
00:34:24.149 --> 00:34:24.159 align:start position:0%
didn't print out the house comments
 
00:34:27.589 --> 00:34:27.599 align:start position:0%
there are house comments online i
 
00:34:30.069 --> 00:34:30.079 align:start position:0%
don't have the exact number
 
00:34:32.069 --> 00:34:32.079 align:start position:0%
and i think there might be one or two
 
00:34:34.470 --> 00:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
maps on that link so i just raised that
 
00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
to remind
 
00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:37.919 align:start position:0%
members of the public that you could
 
00:34:37.919 --> 00:34:39.270 align:start position:0%
members of the public that you could
submit

00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
submit
 
00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:42.720 align:start position:0%
testimony in pdf format at that link and
 
00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:43.510 align:start position:0%
testimony in pdf format at that link and
to

00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:34:45.669 --> 00:34:45.679 align:start position:0%
request committee members to stay
 
00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
updated on what we're receiving on those
 
00:34:53.109 --> 00:34:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:55.669 --> 00:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
direct emails from constituents also
 
00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
does anybody have any questions about
 
00:34:59.270 --> 00:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
the website and access representative
 
00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:02.390 align:start position:0%
the website and access representative
weber

00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:04.069 --> 00:35:04.079 align:start position:0%
i beg your pardon i guess i just wanted
 
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
to make
 
00:35:07.589 --> 00:35:07.599 align:start position:0%
sure that i had it clear
 
00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
um what happens with the emails that we
 
00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
get because
 
00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
in the normal time our emails don't
 
00:35:17.589 --> 00:35:17.599 align:start position:0%
become part of the committee's records
 
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
unless they are submitted as a paper
 
00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
copy or in this case uploaded onto the
 
00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:24.800 align:start position:0%
website so i'm just i'm just wondering
 
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
what's happening with all the emails i
 
00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:28.720 align:start position:0%
suspect what happens with every other
 
00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
house committee at this time hopefully
 
00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
members are reading them and filing them
 
00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
as they deem appropriate
 
00:35:37.829 --> 00:35:37.839 align:start position:0%
we are getting emails
 
00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
on a fairly consistent basis to the
 
00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:41.589 align:start position:0%
on a fairly consistent basis to the
committee

00:35:41.589 --> 00:35:41.599 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
i will say that in my review of the
 
00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
emails as compared to the submitted
 
00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
testimony the submitted testimony on the
 
00:35:50.069 --> 00:35:50.079 align:start position:0%
website appears to be more on point to
 
00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
actual mapping as compared to the emails
 
00:35:55.750 --> 00:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
we've been receiving
 
00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
anybody else on this issue
 
00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
representative fedora it's piedra madame
 
00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
i apologize i'll write it out
 
00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
phonetically no problem i just wanted to
 
00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:08.320 align:start position:0%
clarify on the website i was not i don't
 
00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
see a specific section for comments on
 
00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
house maps just general testimony senate
 
00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:16.630 align:start position:0%
house maps just general testimony senate
county

00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:16.640 align:start position:0%
county
 
00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
congressional is that how it should be
 
00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
or should there be a separate section no
 
00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:22.480 align:start position:0%
i think there's there should be one for
 
00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
house if the are you looking at it right
 
00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:27.430 align:start position:0%
house if the are you looking at it right
now

00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:27.440 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
okay email to it
 
00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
maybe that's why i didn't print it out
 
00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
yesterday yesterday seems a long time
 
00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
ago to me right now just so you know
 
00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:37.680 align:start position:0%

thank you for clarifying that you're
welcome

00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:47.440 align:start position:0%
christina if you can send an email to it
 
00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
that would be terrific and if you get a
 
00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
response while we're still in session
 
00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
can you let me know what it is
 
00:36:56.950 --> 00:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
an issue was raised yesterday morning
 
00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
and communicated with it that there were
 
00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
problems uploading to the site and maybe
 
00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
they've had to take it down for
 
00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:05.430 align:start position:0%
they've had to take it down for
maintenance

00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
maintenance
 
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
but hopefully we'll get an answer to
 
00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
that and thank you
 
00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
for raising that
 
00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
you have in front of you a copy of the
 
00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:14.630 align:start position:0%
you have in front of you a copy of the
letters

00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
letters
 
00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
of a sample letter that was sent to the
 
00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:20.320 align:start position:0%
cities this was sent to berlin
 
00:37:23.589 --> 00:37:23.599 align:start position:0%
i asked lindsay to
 
00:37:25.829 --> 00:37:25.839 align:start position:0%
just print out a sample
 
00:37:27.589 --> 00:37:27.599 align:start position:0%
of the letter that was sent to every
 
00:37:29.589 --> 00:37:29.599 align:start position:0%
city this is actually sort of perfect
 
00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
because berlin does not actually have
 
00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
wards and i have already received a call
 
00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
from them saying we don't have wards
 
00:37:37.589 --> 00:37:37.599 align:start position:0%
don't give us wards
 
00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
so i have assured them we will not be
 
00:37:42.310 --> 00:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
doing that and uh representative
 
00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
bergeron and representative lane
 
00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
if we want copies of the letters to each
 
00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:51.440 align:start position:0%
city will get them after the meeting
 
00:37:53.109 --> 00:37:53.119 align:start position:0%
has anybody heard from any cities in
 
00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
regards to this other than my call from
 
00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:57.670 align:start position:0%
regards to this other than my call from
berlin

00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:59.670 --> 00:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron no i haven't
 
00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
heard anything yet from any of the
 
00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:02.470 align:start position:0%
heard anything yet from any of the
cities

00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:02.480 align:start position:0%
cities
 
00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you um and that leads
 
00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
to the you should have all now everybody
 
00:38:09.349 --> 00:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
in this room
 
00:38:13.109 --> 00:38:13.119 align:start position:0%
oh excuse me representative o'hara
 
00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
i did talk to the mayor of laconia and
 
00:38:17.829 --> 00:38:17.839 align:start position:0%
laconia has put their lines drawn up
 
00:38:19.829 --> 00:38:19.839 align:start position:0%
they just haven't voted yet oh they
 
00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
already have them done yeah so again
 
00:38:24.310 --> 00:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
from scott myers the city manager all
 
00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
right if you can get the the population
 
00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
numbers for those that will be terrific
 
00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming they're pretty close to
 
00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:32.720 align:start position:0%
equal so it shouldn't affect our mapping
 
00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
at this point really yeah that was their
 
00:38:36.069 --> 00:38:36.079 align:start position:0%
goal okay
 
00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
great representative lane
 
00:38:41.109 --> 00:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
i was told informally by the mayor of
 
00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
concord that we would have them i think
 
00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
he said by the end of october so i'm
 
00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
going to follow up with him but he said
 
00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
he would definitely have them to us in
 
00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
time by the 18th
 
00:38:53.589 --> 00:38:53.599 align:start position:0%
wow great
 
00:38:58.150 --> 00:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:59.270 --> 00:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:39:00.870 --> 00:39:00.880 align:start position:0%
the thumb drives you should have
 
00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:02.150 align:start position:0%
the thumb drives you should have
received

00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
received
 
00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
have this city wards with the population
 
00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
allocation that's closer to what we
 
00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:09.200 align:start position:0%
expect as compared to what it is
 
00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:10.470 align:start position:0%
expect as compared to what it is
currently

00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
so hopefully that will assist you in
 
00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
your map drawing it also includes a
 
00:39:17.349 --> 00:39:17.359 align:start position:0%
program for the county commissioner
 
00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
districts which you could do
 
00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
with the other programs
 
00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
but this will make it easier
 
00:39:27.349 --> 00:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
so if you don't have a thumb drive let
 
00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
me know and i think we need to figure
 
00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
out how to get it to representative cody
 
00:39:34.310 --> 00:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
there should be one more but everybody
 
00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
in here should have those thumb drives
 
00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
the next
 
00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
representative weber
 
00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
i'd volunteer to deliver that if you'd
 
00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:46.470 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:46.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
i think you volunteered for the last one
 
00:39:49.589 --> 00:39:49.599 align:start position:0%
or somebody delivered the last one i
 
00:39:49.599 --> 00:39:50.470 align:start position:0%
or somebody delivered the last one i
think

00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:53.990 align:start position:0%
think
okay

00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:55.349 --> 00:39:55.359 align:start position:0%
all right the next thing i wanted to
 
00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:56.720 align:start position:0%
talk about with the full committee was
 
00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:58.150 align:start position:0%
talk about with the full committee was
scheduling

00:39:58.150 --> 00:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
scheduling
 
00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
we are through the public input sessions
 
00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
so we need to do some scheduling
 
00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
there have been some tentative
 
00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
discussions about scheduling things can
 
00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
change of course
 
00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
but i wanted to run through it with the
 
00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
committee with my logic and then move
 
00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
forward from today we need to report out
 
00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:17.200 align:start position:0%
by november 18th
 
00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
that means
 
00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:21.280 align:start position:0%
we need to have votes on all of our
 
00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:29.109 --> 00:40:29.119 align:start position:0%
i believe we should allocate the
 
00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:32.240 align:start position:0%
possibility of meeting for at least one
 
00:40:35.109 --> 00:40:35.119 align:start position:0%
day if not two that week to get through
 
00:40:35.119 --> 00:40:36.829 align:start position:0%
day if not two that week to get through
those

00:40:36.829 --> 00:40:36.839 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:40:36.839 --> 00:40:38.470 align:start position:0%
those
discussions

00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
discussions
 
00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
so plan on meeting
 
00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
and if we get done on the 16th we won't
 
00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:59.030 --> 00:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:01.109 --> 00:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
a request made pretty much at every
 
00:41:03.349 --> 00:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
hearing for public to be able to have
 
00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
input on maps after they're selected
 
00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
so we will have as we in concord as we
 
00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
public input sessions on these bills the
 
00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:27.270 align:start position:0%
 
tentatively

00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
tentatively
 
00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:28.640 align:start position:0%
that will be
 
00:41:31.589 --> 00:41:31.599 align:start position:0%
two days it may be a morning and an
 
00:41:31.599 --> 00:41:32.870 align:start position:0%
two days it may be a morning and an
afternoon

00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
the actual schedule has not been
 
00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:39.750 align:start position:0%
the actual schedule has not been
determined

00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
and to be quite honest with you right
 
00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
now i can't remember whether i requested
 
00:41:45.430 --> 00:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
reps haul for the 8th and the 9th or the
 
00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
9th and the 10th
 
00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:50.480 align:start position:0%
and so i will update you
 
00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
committee members by email but that
 
00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
meeting in reps hall
 
00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
for public input
 
00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:00.640 align:start position:0%
on maps will be the week of the 8th
 
00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:03.440 align:start position:0%
november 11th is veterans day thursday
 
00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
which means that we need to as a
 
00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:16.240 align:start position:0%
committee vote on maps to go
 
00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:18.400 align:start position:0%
in front of the public for comment the
 
00:42:19.829 --> 00:42:19.839 align:start position:0%
following week
 
00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:29.670 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:32.560 align:start position:0%
my preference would be to have a meeting
 
00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
on the third to be able to go into the
 
00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
fourth but i want some committee
 
00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
feedback on that because i am more than
 
00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
happy to go the fourth leaving the fifth
 
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.030 align:start position:0%
happy to go the fourth leaving the fifth
open

00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
open
 
00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:45.200 align:start position:0%
because we can continue
 
00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:46.480 align:start position:0%
the meeting
 
00:42:49.030 --> 00:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
i think the clerk would probably like to
 
00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:54.230 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:57.109 --> 00:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
but these are really work session votes
 
00:42:59.670 --> 00:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
not vote executive session
 
00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:02.560 align:start position:0%
votes the executive sessions will be the
 
00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
week of the 15th
 
00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
so really for the calendar we're talking
 
00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:08.720 align:start position:0%
notices so i guess
 
00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
i'm going to look for a committee
 
00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
consensus on whether to start this
 
00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
process of actually going through the
 
00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
maps and voting on wednesday or thursday
 
00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:22.069 --> 00:43:22.079 align:start position:0%
i would just note that i have a con for
 
00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
a conflict on the third but if if that's
 
00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:25.589 align:start position:0%
a conflict on the third but if if that's
the

00:43:25.589 --> 00:43:25.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
what's most convenient for the committee
 
00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:29.200 align:start position:0%
of course we'll get a substitute
 
00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:30.950 align:start position:0%
of course we'll get a substitute
okay

00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
all right i'm going to look to
 
00:43:34.870 --> 00:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron
 
00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:35.990 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron
um

00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
who i have loaded up with two meetings
 
00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
today with one on election law so i'm
 
00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
trying to defer to him
 
00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:45.200 align:start position:0%
in regards to his city duties because
 
00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
november 2nd are city elections
 
00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
me personally it doesn't matter because
 
00:43:56.870 --> 00:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
i won't be working at the polls and i
 
00:43:58.870 --> 00:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
won't be assisting the clerk uh current
 
00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
clerk anymore with elections okay so
 
00:44:04.150 --> 00:44:04.160 align:start position:0%
it really doesn't matter to me third or
 
00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
okay all right does it representative
 
00:44:15.829 --> 00:44:15.839 align:start position:0%
smith has to leave for a few minutes so
 
00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
anybody else on a preference for what
 
00:44:19.109 --> 00:44:19.119 align:start position:0%
day to start that would be all my
 
00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:20.640 align:start position:0%
baggage behind me that he just stripped
 
00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:23.990 align:start position:0%
baggage behind me that he just stripped
over

00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:25.589 --> 00:44:25.599 align:start position:0%
all right how many want to start on
 
00:44:25.599 --> 00:44:26.790 align:start position:0%
all right how many want to start on
wednesday

00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
wednesday
 
00:44:28.950 --> 00:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
show a hands
 
00:44:31.589 --> 00:44:31.599 align:start position:0%
one two three four five six how many
 
00:44:34.069 --> 00:44:34.079 align:start position:0%
want to start on thursday
 
00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
one two three
 
00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:38.550 align:start position:0%
one two three
four

00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:38.560 align:start position:0%
four
 
00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:39.829 align:start position:0%
four
five

00:44:39.829 --> 00:44:39.839 align:start position:0%
five
 
00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
i think i would prefer to start on
 
00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:43.190 align:start position:0%
i think i would prefer to start on
wednesday

00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
wednesday
 
00:44:44.630 --> 00:44:44.640 align:start position:0%
just because
 
00:44:47.109 --> 00:44:47.119 align:start position:0%
i want to make sure we get through it
 
00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:48.640 align:start position:0%
so let's
 
00:44:51.829 --> 00:44:51.839 align:start position:0%
start on wednesday do you have a
 
00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
conflict all day representative weber
 
00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:56.790 align:start position:0%
conflict all day representative weber
okay

00:44:56.790 --> 00:44:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:00.160 align:start position:0%
my meetings in berlin and
 
00:45:02.069 --> 00:45:02.079 align:start position:0%
so the likelihood of my getting back in
 
00:45:03.670 --> 00:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
time for anything
 
00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
without getting arrested is very
 
00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:06.870 align:start position:0%
without getting arrested is very
unlikely

00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
unlikely
 
00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:11.349 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:45:11.349 --> 00:45:11.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:45:14.069 --> 00:45:14.079 align:start position:0%
and i i may have a conflict on thursday
 
00:45:16.309 --> 00:45:16.319 align:start position:0%
morning as well but that depends on the
 
00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:18.880 align:start position:0%
berlin court schedule so i i just really
 
00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:20.640 align:start position:0%
think given the schedule and what we're
 
00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
doing we're stuck with that week
 
00:45:26.950 --> 00:45:26.960 align:start position:0%
it makes entirely good sense and i just
 
00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:28.470 align:start position:0%
it makes entirely good sense and i just
okay

00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:28.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:45:29.829 --> 00:45:29.839 align:start position:0%
it occurred to the chair that she should
 
00:45:35.109 --> 00:45:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:36.720 align:start position:0%
my husband will have to deal with the
 
00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:42.170 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:46.710 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:46.720 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:45:48.550 --> 00:45:48.560 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
if we're having committee meetings on
 
00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
the third and the fourth
 
00:45:55.270 --> 00:45:55.280 align:start position:0%
we are here on the 20th
 
00:45:59.349 --> 00:45:59.359 align:start position:0%
um it becomes an issue at that at this
 
00:46:02.150 --> 00:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
point i think as to how we want to
 
00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
and i say this because
 
00:46:15.829 --> 00:46:15.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:15.839 --> 00:46:17.109 align:start position:0%
 
now

00:46:17.109 --> 00:46:17.119 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:46:18.790 --> 00:46:18.800 align:start position:0%
i haven't particularly put a call out
 
00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:20.240 align:start position:0%
for maps but
 
00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
i haven't seen many
 
00:46:24.309 --> 00:46:24.319 align:start position:0%
and we need to have maps at meetings to
 
00:46:25.750 --> 00:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
vote on so
 
00:46:29.109 --> 00:46:29.119 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire has kindly done
 
00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
some work on maps with the programs that
 
00:46:33.270 --> 00:46:33.280 align:start position:0%
we've had now for quite a while and you
 
00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
have that handout
 
00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
so i would i am going to ask
 
00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire to go through
 
00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:49.829 --> 00:46:49.839 align:start position:0%
so that as a committee we can make some
 
00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
decisions on when things have to be
 
00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:54.640 align:start position:0%
submitted and if this format
 
00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:56.309 align:start position:0%
submitted and if this format
works

00:46:56.309 --> 00:46:56.319 align:start position:0%
works
 
00:46:59.270 --> 00:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
we are going to deal with paper
 
00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:00.790 align:start position:0%
we are going to deal with paper
because

00:47:00.790 --> 00:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:47:03.589 --> 00:47:03.599 align:start position:0%
with the room that spread like this to
 
00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
do things on a screen is simply
 
00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:08.630 align:start position:0%
do things on a screen is simply
impractical

00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
impractical
 
00:47:11.109 --> 00:47:11.119 align:start position:0%
and i want to have control over what
 
00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
everybody is looking at to be sure it is
 
00:47:15.670 --> 00:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
the same
 
00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
yes so
 
00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
all right i worked on three counties
 
00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:24.870 align:start position:0%
all right i worked on three counties
belknap

00:47:24.870 --> 00:47:24.880 align:start position:0%
belknap
 
00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:28.720 align:start position:0%
grafton and merrimack
 
00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:30.640 align:start position:0%
there are some printing issues due to
 
00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:36.390 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
these these packages are not quite as
 
00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:40.640 align:start position:0%
complete as i might like
 
00:47:42.309 --> 00:47:42.319 align:start position:0%
but we'll go through them
 
00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:46.240 align:start position:0%
the top is a region a representatives
 
00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:50.480 align:start position:0%
district for merrimack county
 
00:47:53.910 --> 00:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
and the towns are on the
 
00:47:56.069 --> 00:47:56.079 align:start position:0%
page three
 
00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:04.309 --> 00:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:06.160 align:start position:0%
bill nap yes excuse me they're an
 
00:48:07.829 --> 00:48:07.839 align:start position:0%
alphabetical or they're not in
 
00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:09.200 align:start position:0%
alphabetical order oh yeah okay
 
00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
merrimack is two sheets in
 
00:48:12.950 --> 00:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
yeah there's a so we'll start with
 
00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
bellnap because it's smaller
 
00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
okay the first map which is on the cover
 
00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:19.670 align:start position:0%
okay the first map which is on the cover
shows

00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
shows
 
00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:21.990 align:start position:0%
shows
districts

00:48:21.990 --> 00:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
and there's a listing of them
 
00:48:26.549 --> 00:48:26.559 align:start position:0%
so that each ward of laconia gets its
 
00:48:28.549 --> 00:48:28.559 align:start position:0%
own representative
 
00:48:30.870 --> 00:48:30.880 align:start position:0%
and then there's a floaterial over the
 
00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:36.390 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:48:36.390 --> 00:48:36.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
oh okay then there's barnstead belmont
 
00:48:42.150 --> 00:48:42.160 align:start position:0%
and gilmanton with five reps
 
00:48:44.230 --> 00:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
which is bigger than i might like but
 
00:48:46.390 --> 00:48:46.400 align:start position:0%
the size of the town pretty much
 
00:48:49.589 --> 00:48:49.599 align:start position:0%
prevented me from doing anything else
 
00:48:52.630 --> 00:48:52.640 align:start position:0%
alton and guilford for four reps
 
00:48:54.790 --> 00:48:54.800 align:start position:0%
meredith sanborn
 
00:48:56.630 --> 00:48:56.640 align:start position:0%
and tilton for four
 
00:48:58.710 --> 00:48:58.720 align:start position:0%
and then center harbor and new hampton
 
00:49:00.150 --> 00:49:00.160 align:start position:0%
for one
 
00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:01.750 align:start position:0%
for one
and

00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
this the
 
00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
interesting part about this is that the
 
00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
the whole county
 
00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:10.640 align:start position:0%
that has very inconvenient sizes for
 
00:49:12.069 --> 00:49:12.079 align:start position:0%
every town
 
00:49:14.309 --> 00:49:14.319 align:start position:0%
and it was really impossible to give
 
00:49:19.589 --> 00:49:19.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:21.430 --> 00:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
and what is the resulting deviation
 
00:49:22.829 --> 00:49:22.839 align:start position:0%
range when you use
 
00:49:22.839 --> 00:49:24.790 align:start position:0%
range when you use
5.29

00:49:24.790 --> 00:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
5.29
 
00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:25.670 align:start position:0%
5.29
okay

00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:49:28.870 --> 00:49:28.880 align:start position:0%
so as the committee is aware
 
00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
we're shooting for plus or minus five so
 
00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
we're running well this is this is
 
00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
actually skewed lower it's minus six to
 
00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
two minus point seven eight
 
00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
because of the size of the county so
 
00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
this could i'm sure this could be
 
00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
improved but it it's a first pass that
 
00:49:50.230 --> 00:49:50.240 align:start position:0%
seems to meet the requirements
 
00:49:52.470 --> 00:49:52.480 align:start position:0%
all right so what you have is a printout
 
00:49:55.990 --> 00:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
of the map and then the printout of the
 
00:50:00.069 --> 00:50:00.079 align:start position:0%
towns with reps with deviations
 
00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
so and was this all available from the
 
00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:04.240 align:start position:0%
program that we're working from yes
 
00:50:06.790 --> 00:50:06.800 align:start position:0%
ma'am all right and just a printout from
 
00:50:09.349 --> 00:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
from it okay now there were some issues
 
00:50:11.829 --> 00:50:11.839 align:start position:0%
in regards to printing this out so how
 
00:50:13.829 --> 00:50:13.839 align:start position:0%
did those end up getting resolved
 
00:50:13.839 --> 00:50:15.109 align:start position:0%
did those end up getting resolved
um

00:50:15.109 --> 00:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
i managed to
 
00:50:19.349 --> 00:50:19.359 align:start position:0%
at if i were at home i could have just
 
00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
printed from the program
 
00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
because i wasn't at home i had to
 
00:50:26.470 --> 00:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
manipulate it into a pdf
 
00:50:29.190 --> 00:50:29.200 align:start position:0%
and then email that to our staff
 
00:50:31.349 --> 00:50:31.359 align:start position:0%
all right so i'm i'm raising that issue
 
00:50:33.270 --> 00:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
so committee members when you're working
 
00:50:35.109 --> 00:50:35.119 align:start position:0%
on maps you need to be aware of what
 
00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
you're on
 
00:50:39.190 --> 00:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
for purposes of transmission and it was
 
00:50:40.710 --> 00:50:40.720 align:start position:0%
it was a
 
00:50:44.230 --> 00:50:44.240 align:start position:0%
convoluted process to get the map in pdf
 
00:50:46.150 --> 00:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:50:48.309 --> 00:50:48.319 align:start position:0%
yes thank you representative
 
00:50:49.829 --> 00:50:49.839 align:start position:0%
disagreeing with me
 
00:50:50.950 --> 00:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
the list of towns with deviations is a
 
00:50:57.589 --> 00:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
cut and paste that's much easier to get
 
00:50:57.599 --> 00:50:59.190 align:start position:0%
cut and paste that's much easier to get
okay

00:50:59.190 --> 00:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
and then all right anybody have any
 
00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
questions on belnap
 
00:51:08.870 --> 00:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
no ma'am but there are no floaters
 
00:51:13.589 --> 00:51:13.599 align:start position:0%
except the one in laconia the second one
 
00:51:16.069 --> 00:51:16.079 align:start position:0%
is the county commissioners oh oh okay
 
00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
it's just there aren't any labels yes
 
00:51:19.829 --> 00:51:19.839 align:start position:0%
well like i said there's some some
 
00:51:25.109 --> 00:51:25.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:27.430 --> 00:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
the county the second the back of the
 
00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
first page is the commissioners yes
 
00:51:33.109 --> 00:51:33.119 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
00:51:33.119 --> 00:51:34.150 align:start position:0%
representative smith
i

00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:36.630 align:start position:0%
i
um

00:51:36.630 --> 00:51:36.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:40.710 --> 00:51:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:44.230 --> 00:51:44.240 align:start position:0%
the lists here the left hand column says
 
00:51:47.430 --> 00:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
total seats 19 the right
 
00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:50.870 align:start position:0%
total seats 19 the right
18.

00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:53.670 --> 00:51:53.680 align:start position:0%
there are 19 seats in
 
00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:54.549 align:start position:0%
there are 19 seats in
in

00:51:54.549 --> 00:51:54.559 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
in bellnap
 
00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:56.630 align:start position:0%
in bellnap
for

00:51:56.630 --> 00:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:51:59.109 --> 00:51:59.119 align:start position:0%
since i was using the reps map
 
00:52:01.109 --> 00:52:01.119 align:start position:0%
pro this was before the county program
 
00:52:03.510 --> 00:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
got before the county program i just
 
00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
made it for six so the numbers would be
 
00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate the these this isn't the
 
00:52:09.190 --> 00:52:09.200 align:start position:0%
exact deviation
 
00:52:12.069 --> 00:52:12.079 align:start position:0%
but the the spread should be about right
 
00:52:14.069 --> 00:52:14.079 align:start position:0%
it will have to be just because as i
 
00:52:15.990 --> 00:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
said you could do the counties but you
 
00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
ended up doing the deviation spread
 
00:52:19.990 --> 00:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
based on reps so that's why your number
 
00:52:22.470 --> 00:52:22.480 align:start position:0%
of reps is slightly off if you're using
 
00:52:24.150 --> 00:52:24.160 align:start position:0%
the new program that we have that can
 
00:52:27.990 --> 00:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
get fixed does not have it have an even
 
00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
19 is not divisible by 3 evenly so i had
 
00:52:33.829 --> 00:52:33.839 align:start position:0%
to do it with an approximation
 
00:52:36.390 --> 00:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
but if you look at the population of the
 
00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
three districts
 
00:52:43.630 --> 00:52:43.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:46.710 --> 00:52:46.720 align:start position:0%
2589 and 21
 
00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
48 which should give you an idea of how
 
00:52:51.910 --> 00:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
close they are
 
00:52:53.829 --> 00:52:53.839 align:start position:0%
representative lane
 
00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for doing this
 
00:52:57.829 --> 00:52:57.839 align:start position:0%
this is awesome um
 
00:52:59.670 --> 00:52:59.680 align:start position:0%
the bottom of the
 
00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
the one for the wraps the page yeah
 
00:53:03.990 --> 00:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
there's that little triangle there
 
00:53:06.069 --> 00:53:06.079 align:start position:0%
that's barnstead okay the rest of
 
00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
barnstead is falling off has fallen off
 
00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:10.640 align:start position:0%
the page i figured that
 
00:53:12.870 --> 00:53:12.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you in fact it fell off on
 
00:53:15.270 --> 00:53:15.280 align:start position:0%
both maps yeah but it's still barnstead
 
00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:16.309 align:start position:0%
both maps yeah but it's still barnstead
okay

00:53:16.309 --> 00:53:16.319 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:53:18.549 --> 00:53:18.559 align:start position:0%
we haven't forgotten barnstein
 
00:53:21.510 --> 00:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
representative weber
 
00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
thank you with respect to the
 
00:53:25.270 --> 00:53:25.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner's district and the total
 
00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
seat sea schools 18 i understand the
 
00:53:29.589 --> 00:53:29.599 align:start position:0%
concept of nine not being 19 not being
 
00:53:32.150 --> 00:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
divisible are you
 
00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
assuming that the commissioner district
 
00:53:39.510 --> 00:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
should track the um
 
00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
should track the other districts or
 
00:53:44.390 --> 00:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
no the commissioner district should be
 
00:53:46.470 --> 00:53:46.480 align:start position:0%
as equal as possible it's just that's
 
00:53:47.990 --> 00:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
the way the way you had to do it to get
 
00:53:50.549 --> 00:53:50.559 align:start position:0%
it to print out correct okay i got it
 
00:53:52.309 --> 00:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
yes no the
 
00:53:53.990 --> 00:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
well i could who calculate the
 
00:53:56.390 --> 00:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
deviations by hand but it's
 
00:53:59.670 --> 00:53:59.680 align:start position:0%
it would be a pain so
 
00:54:01.829 --> 00:54:01.839 align:start position:0%
the hold on representative mcguire
 
00:54:03.430 --> 00:54:03.440 align:start position:0%
representative barry
 
00:54:04.870 --> 00:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
uh yes uh thank you representative
 
00:54:06.790 --> 00:54:06.800 align:start position:0%
mcguire for doing all these so you you
 
00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
noted in your
 
00:54:09.750 --> 00:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
initial testimony
 
00:54:11.829 --> 00:54:11.839 align:start position:0%
or your statement i should say that it's
 
00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
it's sometimes very difficult to
 
00:54:16.549 --> 00:54:16.559 align:start position:0%
give each town its own rep in belknap
 
00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
county specifically because of how off
 
00:54:22.470 --> 00:54:22.480 align:start position:0%
they are from the standard deviation um
 
00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:24.640 align:start position:0%
if you in you looked at any other
 
00:54:26.549 --> 00:54:26.559 align:start position:0%
counties have you kind of seen that
 
00:54:27.829 --> 00:54:27.839 align:start position:0%
around or is that just that could be a
 
00:54:29.349 --> 00:54:29.359 align:start position:0%
built up county problem or is that going
 
00:54:31.510 --> 00:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
to be a problem it's a problem
 
00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:32.870 align:start position:0%
to be a problem it's a problem
everywhere

00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
everywhere
 
00:54:35.670 --> 00:54:35.680 align:start position:0%
because if if nothing else the easiest
 
00:54:39.190 --> 00:54:39.200 align:start position:0%
way to give every town their rep is to
 
00:54:41.670 --> 00:54:41.680 align:start position:0%
have enormous flow tarials
 
00:54:44.710 --> 00:54:44.720 align:start position:0%
which we heard even more we heard even
 
00:54:47.190 --> 00:54:47.200 align:start position:0%
more testimony against
 
00:54:49.589 --> 00:54:49.599 align:start position:0%
than for every town to get their rep
 
00:54:52.069 --> 00:54:52.079 align:start position:0%
even the people that
 
00:54:54.789 --> 00:54:54.799 align:start position:0%
are in small towns that don't so they
 
00:54:56.470 --> 00:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
weren't demanding their own rep were
 
00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:04.230 --> 00:55:04.240 align:start position:0%
okay so and yes it is a problem
 
00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:05.109 align:start position:0%
okay so and yes it is a problem
but

00:55:05.109 --> 00:55:05.119 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:55:09.030 --> 00:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:11.349 --> 00:55:11.359 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair to answer rep
 
00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:12.720 align:start position:0%
barry's uh
 
00:55:15.030 --> 00:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
problem we did hear at almost every one
 
00:55:18.630 --> 00:55:18.640 align:start position:0%
of our public input sessions individuals
 
00:55:21.829 --> 00:55:21.839 align:start position:0%
saying if we have a minimum of the 3444
 
00:55:23.750 --> 00:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
we deserve our own rep
 
00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:24.630 align:start position:0%
we deserve our own rep
um

00:55:24.630 --> 00:55:24.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:26.309 --> 00:55:26.319 align:start position:0%
i think it's very important for people
 
00:55:28.470 --> 00:55:28.480 align:start position:0%
to understand that that's
 
00:55:30.549 --> 00:55:30.559 align:start position:0%
in some cases an impossibility and i've
 
00:55:34.150 --> 00:55:34.160 align:start position:0%
got a great great example for everybody
 
00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
to look at
 
00:55:37.510 --> 00:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
if you look down in the southeast corner
 
00:55:38.950 --> 00:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
we don't have it right here but well
 
00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:40.480 align:start position:0%
then you don't have it for us to look at
 
00:55:43.030 --> 00:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
we are not talking about maps at any
 
00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
point if people are not looking at them
 
00:55:47.349 --> 00:55:47.359 align:start position:0%
because it just gets too
 
00:55:47.359 --> 00:55:48.789 align:start position:0%
because it just gets too
confusing

00:55:48.789 --> 00:55:48.799 align:start position:0%
confusing
 
00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
and they're not you know we're not
 
00:55:53.190 --> 00:55:53.200 align:start position:0%
submitting anything for people to
 
00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
um consider and vote but i i think that
 
00:55:57.990 --> 00:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
that sort of
 
00:55:59.589 --> 00:55:59.599 align:start position:0%
hearing that issue i actually got a big
 
00:56:01.030 --> 00:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
kick out of that issue because we were
 
00:56:02.470 --> 00:56:02.480 align:start position:0%
sitting there with senators and people
 
00:56:03.829 --> 00:56:03.839 align:start position:0%
were complaining about the size of
 
00:56:05.510 --> 00:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
districts and representation and i'm
 
00:56:06.870 --> 00:56:06.880 align:start position:0%
sort of looking over at the senators
 
00:56:09.910 --> 00:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
going how's that working out for you um
 
00:56:13.589 --> 00:56:13.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:16.150 --> 00:56:16.160 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering for comparison
 
00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
purposes and i would do this if i could
 
00:56:20.710 --> 00:56:20.720 align:start position:0%
if i could actually do the maps but i
 
00:56:23.109 --> 00:56:23.119 align:start position:0%
can't because i don't have technology
 
00:56:24.789 --> 00:56:24.799 align:start position:0%
that actually there's technology
 
00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
downstairs in what used to be the
 
00:56:28.390 --> 00:56:28.400 align:start position:0%
smoking room for all representatives to
 
00:56:31.670 --> 00:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
use okay well i will try and do that my
 
00:56:33.829 --> 00:56:33.839 align:start position:0%
understanding was that they didn't want
 
00:56:33.839 --> 00:56:35.589 align:start position:0%
understanding was that they didn't want
um

00:56:35.589 --> 00:56:35.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:38.549 --> 00:56:38.559 align:start position:0%
stuff uploaded on those because of
 
00:56:39.990 --> 00:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
i could be wrong about that that that's
 
00:56:42.069 --> 00:56:42.079 align:start position:0%
a memory from a long time ago so this
 
00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
came from i.t so if there's an issue we
 
00:56:46.710 --> 00:56:46.720 align:start position:0%
need to talk to i.t
 
00:56:49.109 --> 00:56:49.119 align:start position:0%
i i will check those out and thank you
 
00:56:51.349 --> 00:56:51.359 align:start position:0%
okay i just i'm wondering if it's
 
00:56:53.190 --> 00:56:53.200 align:start position:0%
possible to
 
00:56:57.270 --> 00:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
try and compare because i as as
 
00:56:59.270 --> 00:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire did i heard that
 
00:57:00.870 --> 00:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
the comment about
 
00:57:02.950 --> 00:57:02.960 align:start position:0%
enormous flow tarials don't make a lot
 
00:57:04.230 --> 00:57:04.240 align:start position:0%
of sense
 
00:57:04.240 --> 00:57:05.430 align:start position:0%
of sense
but

00:57:05.430 --> 00:57:05.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:57:07.829 --> 00:57:07.839 align:start position:0%
what i also heard from people was
 
00:57:09.750 --> 00:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
if if we could get
 
00:57:12.549 --> 00:57:12.559 align:start position:0%
the underlying representation as small
 
00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
as possible then maybe the enormous flow
 
00:57:17.430 --> 00:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
materials don't matter it's easier to
 
00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
actually get the deviations right if you
 
00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
do it the way representative mcguire did
 
00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
it because you have a little more to
 
00:57:26.309 --> 00:57:26.319 align:start position:0%
play with in each in each case well
 
00:57:28.789 --> 00:57:28.799 align:start position:0%
we've got 15 members so we can have 15
 
00:57:28.799 --> 00:57:29.750 align:start position:0%
we've got 15 members so we can have 15
maps

00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
maps
 
00:57:31.109 --> 00:57:31.119 align:start position:0%
there we go
 
00:57:33.270 --> 00:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
in this case try and figure that out
 
00:57:35.270 --> 00:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
i'm going to make work for other people
 
00:57:37.030 --> 00:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
yeah well let's make work for some
 
00:57:38.710 --> 00:57:38.720 align:start position:0%
people but we've got some people
 
00:57:40.390 --> 00:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
apparently doing all the work and other
 
00:57:42.150 --> 00:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
people maybe not so
 
00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
part of that discussion is going to be
 
00:57:45.190 --> 00:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
where are these maps going to come from
 
00:57:46.390 --> 00:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
and when are we going to get them
 
00:57:48.390 --> 00:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
continue representative
 
00:57:51.030 --> 00:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair in belknap county
 
00:57:56.230 --> 00:57:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:58.069 --> 00:57:58.079 align:start position:0%
i tried believe me
 
00:57:58.079 --> 00:57:59.670 align:start position:0%
i tried believe me
okay

00:57:59.670 --> 00:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
this don't work exactly and i've got a
 
00:58:03.990 --> 00:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
few more all right so for county
 
00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:05.349 align:start position:0%
few more all right so for county
commissioners

00:58:05.349 --> 00:58:05.359 align:start position:0%
commissioners
 
00:58:07.109 --> 00:58:07.119 align:start position:0%
normally in the case of a county
 
00:58:07.119 --> 00:58:08.470 align:start position:0%
normally in the case of a county
commissioner

00:58:08.470 --> 00:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:09.430 align:start position:0%
commissioner
you

00:58:09.430 --> 00:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:58:12.950 --> 00:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
you try not to split up the cities
 
00:58:15.829 --> 00:58:15.839 align:start position:0%
but it was impossible to come up with
 
00:58:18.549 --> 00:58:18.559 align:start position:0%
anything close to
 
00:58:20.390 --> 00:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
plus or minus five percent without
 
00:58:22.789 --> 00:58:22.799 align:start position:0%
breaking up laconia because of the way
 
00:58:26.630 --> 00:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:29.349 --> 00:58:29.359 align:start position:0%
and again this is a a draft and i would
 
00:58:32.230 --> 00:58:32.240 align:start position:0%
love to have somebody do it better
 
00:58:32.240 --> 00:58:32.950 align:start position:0%
love to have somebody do it better
but

00:58:32.950 --> 00:58:32.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:58:34.950 --> 00:58:34.960 align:start position:0%
representative herrera i hear your name
 
00:58:36.789 --> 00:58:36.799 align:start position:0%
being called in regards to belknap
 
00:58:38.470 --> 00:58:38.480 align:start position:0%
county issue for division of the city
 
00:58:41.270 --> 00:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
for county commissioners
 
00:58:46.150 --> 00:58:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:49.030 --> 00:58:49.040 align:start position:0%
okay no it's it's it's the county it's
 
00:58:52.309 --> 00:58:52.319 align:start position:0%
three districts exactly
 
00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
and the alton barnstead belmont
 
00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:56.720 align:start position:0%
gilmanton district
 
00:58:56.720 --> 00:58:58.309 align:start position:0%
gilmanton district
is

00:58:58.309 --> 00:58:58.319 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
too big
 
00:59:02.230 --> 00:59:02.240 align:start position:0%
but there's no other way to do it
 
00:59:04.309 --> 00:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
because they aren't adjacent to anything
 
00:59:04.319 --> 00:59:05.990 align:start position:0%
because they aren't adjacent to anything
smaller

00:59:05.990 --> 00:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
smaller
 
00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
you know you've
 
00:59:10.549 --> 00:59:10.559 align:start position:0%
you've got to cover alton and barnstead
 
00:59:10.559 --> 00:59:11.829 align:start position:0%
you've got to cover alton and barnstead
somehow

00:59:11.829 --> 00:59:11.839 align:start position:0%
somehow
 
00:59:13.990 --> 00:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
and swapping guilford and belmont would
 
00:59:16.549 --> 00:59:16.559 align:start position:0%
just make it worse not better
 
00:59:16.559 --> 00:59:17.430 align:start position:0%
just make it worse not better
so

00:59:17.430 --> 00:59:17.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:59:19.349 --> 00:59:19.359 align:start position:0%
there are three districts so what you're
 
00:59:21.430 --> 00:59:21.440 align:start position:0%
saying is belknap county has issues
 
00:59:23.349 --> 00:59:23.359 align:start position:0%
belknap county has issues yes i wouldn't
 
00:59:23.359 --> 00:59:24.069 align:start position:0%
belknap county has issues yes i wouldn't
go

00:59:24.069 --> 00:59:24.079 align:start position:0%
go
 
00:59:26.309 --> 00:59:26.319 align:start position:0%
so far say they're insurmountable but it
 
00:59:28.789 --> 00:59:28.799 align:start position:0%
it was difficult okay the second
 
00:59:31.750 --> 00:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
district is the is the northeast
 
00:59:33.910 --> 00:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
guilford center harbor meredith new
 
00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:34.950 align:start position:0%
guilford center harbor meredith new
hampton

00:59:34.950 --> 00:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
hampton
 
00:59:38.549 --> 00:59:38.559 align:start position:0%
and one ward of laconia
 
00:59:40.789 --> 00:59:40.799 align:start position:0%
and the other one is the rest of laconia
 
00:59:44.069 --> 00:59:44.079 align:start position:0%
plus sanbornton and tilton
 
00:59:45.589 --> 00:59:45.599 align:start position:0%
and they're
 
00:59:47.910 --> 00:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
they're within deviation but
 
00:59:50.150 --> 00:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
uh it's not i'm not proud of it i'd love
 
00:59:51.510 --> 00:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
to have somebody come up with something
 
00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:54.470 align:start position:0%
to have somebody come up with something
better

00:59:54.470 --> 00:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:56.710 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:59:56.710 --> 00:59:56.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:00:03.109 --> 01:00:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:04.230 --> 01:00:04.240 align:start position:0%
which has
 
01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:06.880 align:start position:0%
conveniently 45 reps so the
 
01:00:09.750 --> 01:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
county commissioners was easy
 
01:00:10.789 --> 01:00:10.799 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:00:14.069 --> 01:00:14.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:18.870 --> 01:00:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:19.829 align:start position:0%
 
for

01:00:19.829 --> 01:00:19.839 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:00:23.510 --> 01:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
let's see the list of towns is on page
 
01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
five and i'm afraid that due to
 
01:00:28.470 --> 01:00:28.480 align:start position:0%
due to printing issues it doesn't
 
01:00:31.589 --> 01:00:31.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:33.109 --> 01:00:33.119 align:start position:0%
all right but part of this exercise is
 
01:00:34.789 --> 01:00:34.799 align:start position:0%
to give everybody an idea of what we can
 
01:00:36.710 --> 01:00:36.720 align:start position:0%
do and what we can take a look at this
 
01:00:37.990 --> 01:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
one is
 
01:00:39.990 --> 01:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
if we didn't quite get all of them
 
01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:40.710 align:start position:0%
if we didn't quite get all of them
but

01:00:40.710 --> 01:00:40.720 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:46.230 align:start position:0%
but
um

01:00:46.230 --> 01:00:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:48.470 --> 01:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
the first one is london newbury sutton
 
01:00:51.910 --> 01:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
and wilmot for three reps
 
01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:53.109 align:start position:0%
and wilmot for three reps
if

01:00:53.109 --> 01:00:53.119 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:00:55.670 --> 01:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
you could give new london its own rep
 
01:00:57.829 --> 01:00:57.839 align:start position:0%
but then you would give the other
 
01:00:59.829 --> 01:00:59.839 align:start position:0%
district would have a deviation of
 
01:01:01.990 --> 01:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
greater than five percent
 
01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:02.870 align:start position:0%
greater than five percent
uh

01:01:02.870 --> 01:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:01:05.430 --> 01:01:05.440 align:start position:0%
i think was 5.2
 
01:01:07.670 --> 01:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
and so i chose to include new london in
 
01:01:09.750 --> 01:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
with the smaller towns that are adjacent
 
01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of a lot of small towns
 
01:01:17.349 --> 01:01:17.359 align:start position:0%
in the north in the north and west
 
01:01:20.069 --> 01:01:20.079 align:start position:0%
the second district is franklin all
 
01:01:23.670 --> 01:01:23.680 align:start position:0%
three dis all three wards
 
01:01:25.670 --> 01:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
then northfield has a rep
 
01:01:27.990 --> 01:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
and there's a floatarial over franklin
 
01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
and northfield which is fairly similar
 
01:01:33.829 --> 01:01:33.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:36.630 --> 01:01:36.640 align:start position:0%
danbury hill andover salisbury and
 
01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:38.710 align:start position:0%
danbury hill andover salisbury and
webster

01:01:38.710 --> 01:01:38.720 align:start position:0%
webster
 
01:01:40.789 --> 01:01:40.799 align:start position:0%
with two reps
 
01:01:43.109 --> 01:01:43.119 align:start position:0%
i would have liked to put andover and
 
01:01:45.030 --> 01:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
hill together to make one rap district
 
01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
but that leaves danbury floating out
 
01:01:49.270 --> 01:01:49.280 align:start position:0%
causing trouble for everybody else
 
01:01:51.430 --> 01:01:51.440 align:start position:0%
so combine them
 
01:01:54.789 --> 01:01:54.799 align:start position:0%
boscoin gets its own rep
 
01:01:58.150 --> 01:01:58.160 align:start position:0%
loudon is with canterbury as currently
 
01:02:00.309 --> 01:02:00.319 align:start position:0%
and then there's a fairly large
 
01:02:02.309 --> 01:02:02.319 align:start position:0%
floaterial over
 
01:02:06.069 --> 01:02:06.079 align:start position:0%
from danbury to loudon
 
01:02:10.309 --> 01:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:11.910 --> 01:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
i'm sure there are there are other ways
 
01:02:15.029 --> 01:02:15.039 align:start position:0%
to do it but that that works nicely
 
01:02:15.039 --> 01:02:16.870 align:start position:0%
to do it but that that works nicely
um

01:02:16.870 --> 01:02:16.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:18.390 align:start position:0%
um
henniker

01:02:18.390 --> 01:02:18.400 align:start position:0%
henniker
 
01:02:20.710 --> 01:02:20.720 align:start position:0%
is with bradford and warner which are
 
01:02:23.190 --> 01:02:23.200 align:start position:0%
each too small to have their own rep
 
01:02:25.190 --> 01:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
and it comes out to be
 
01:02:28.150 --> 01:02:28.160 align:start position:0%
a three rep district
 
01:02:29.990 --> 01:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
hopkinton is with
 
01:02:32.789 --> 01:02:32.799 align:start position:0%
concord ward 5 as currently for another
 
01:02:37.349 --> 01:02:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:40.230 --> 01:02:40.240 align:start position:0%
dunbarton and hooksett comes out with
 
01:02:46.150 --> 01:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:50.710 --> 01:02:50.720 align:start position:0%
the other war bow is with
 
01:02:53.829 --> 01:02:53.839 align:start position:0%
um i think it's ward 7
 
01:02:57.349 --> 01:02:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:00.630 --> 01:03:00.640 align:start position:0%
and then they and um
 
01:03:03.670 --> 01:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
in a three rep district
 
01:03:05.910 --> 01:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
then the other wards get each get their
 
01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:14.630 --> 01:03:14.640 align:start position:0%
pamper could try gesture together for
 
01:03:18.470 --> 01:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:20.870 --> 01:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
epsom and pittsfield together because
 
01:03:22.710 --> 01:03:22.720 align:start position:0%
pitchfield has actually gotten smaller
 
01:03:24.710 --> 01:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
unfortunately so we have to
 
01:03:26.710 --> 01:03:26.720 align:start position:0%
we have to get give the same base
 
01:03:28.630 --> 01:03:28.640 align:start position:0%
district to the two towns
 
01:03:30.309 --> 01:03:30.319 align:start position:0%
almost town gets its own and then
 
01:03:32.150 --> 01:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
there's a floatarial over the three
 
01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:34.549 align:start position:0%
there's a floatarial over the three
towns

01:03:34.549 --> 01:03:34.559 align:start position:0%
towns
 
01:03:37.670 --> 01:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
again this works the numbers work
 
01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:40.160 align:start position:0%
i've i've made the flow tarials as small
 
01:03:41.990 --> 01:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
as i could but
 
01:03:45.589 --> 01:03:45.599 align:start position:0%
i'm sure there's room for improvement
 
01:03:47.910 --> 01:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions on the rep map
 
01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:48.789 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions on the rep map
as

01:03:48.789 --> 01:03:48.799 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:03:48.799 --> 01:03:49.990 align:start position:0%
as
drafted

01:03:49.990 --> 01:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
drafted
 
01:03:53.829 --> 01:03:53.839 align:start position:0%
um representative lane um thank you um
 
01:03:56.230 --> 01:03:56.240 align:start position:0%
i have looked at this i haven't done a
 
01:03:57.910 --> 01:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
map the way that you've done it is there
 
01:04:00.630 --> 01:04:00.640 align:start position:0%
no way to keep concord together as or
 
01:04:03.029 --> 01:04:03.039 align:start position:0%
just keep it as it is now and have ward
 
01:04:04.390 --> 01:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
5 share
 
01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
with hopkinton
 
01:04:08.710 --> 01:04:08.720 align:start position:0%
it that leaves beau out in the middle
 
01:04:10.829 --> 01:04:10.839 align:start position:0%
with with a major
 
01:04:13.829 --> 01:04:13.839 align:start position:0%
deviation um okay i couldn't find one if
 
01:04:16.470 --> 01:04:16.480 align:start position:0%
you can to be interesting okay yeah we
 
01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
know we've been working on it so yeah
 
01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:18.870 align:start position:0%
know we've been working on it so yeah
well

01:04:18.870 --> 01:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:04:20.950 --> 01:04:20.960 align:start position:0%
no i was just curious because it's it is
 
01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:21.670 align:start position:0%
no i was just curious because it's it is
a

01:04:21.670 --> 01:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:04:24.230 --> 01:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
problem okay well thank you
 
01:04:26.870 --> 01:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
fortunately the towns adjacent to
 
01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:28.150 align:start position:0%
fortunately the towns adjacent to
concord

01:04:28.150 --> 01:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
concord
 
01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:30.309 align:start position:0%
concord
are

01:04:30.309 --> 01:04:30.319 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:04:33.349 --> 01:04:33.359 align:start position:0%
are well integrated into it
 
01:04:36.390 --> 01:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
there's no question that you know
 
01:04:38.309 --> 01:04:38.319 align:start position:0%
if you drive on 3a you can see how
 
01:04:41.750 --> 01:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
concord goes into bell with the
 
01:04:45.829 --> 01:04:45.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:48.230 --> 01:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
okay commissioners from the commissioner
 
01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:49.430 align:start position:0%
okay commissioners from the commissioner
district

01:04:49.430 --> 01:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
district
 
01:04:52.870 --> 01:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
uh that that one we did i did keep
 
01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
concord together
 
01:04:57.430 --> 01:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
and conquered plus bow is a third of the
 
01:04:57.440 --> 01:04:58.309 align:start position:0%
and conquered plus bow is a third of the
county

01:04:58.309 --> 01:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
county
 
01:05:00.870 --> 01:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
almost exactly you could see the numbers
 
01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:01.670 align:start position:0%
almost exactly you could see the numbers
it's

01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:08.470 --> 01:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
for 15 reps so that works
 
01:05:11.109 --> 01:05:11.119 align:start position:0%
and then you divide the other two up the
 
01:05:13.190 --> 01:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
rest of the county
 
01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:15.510 align:start position:0%
rest of the county
uh

01:05:15.510 --> 01:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:17.190 --> 01:05:17.200 align:start position:0%
to get your fifty to get the other two
 
01:05:18.630 --> 01:05:18.640 align:start position:0%
two districts
 
01:05:21.029 --> 01:05:21.039 align:start position:0%
uh these the at the
 
01:05:22.549 --> 01:05:22.559 align:start position:0%
on this plan
 
01:05:25.589 --> 01:05:25.599 align:start position:0%
the two other districts other than
 
01:05:28.230 --> 01:05:28.240 align:start position:0%
concord are within uh
 
01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:29.430 align:start position:0%
concord are within uh
seven

01:05:29.430 --> 01:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
seven
 
01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:30.630 align:start position:0%
seven
people

01:05:30.630 --> 01:05:30.640 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:05:32.150 --> 01:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
so i think that's about as good as we
 
01:05:35.990 --> 01:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:38.150 --> 01:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
there are other plans that would work
 
01:05:40.150 --> 01:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
it keeps franklin which is the only
 
01:05:41.430 --> 01:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
other city
 
01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
in one district
 
01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:45.190 align:start position:0%
in one district
and

01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:05:47.270 --> 01:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
although it wasn't one of my goals it
 
01:05:49.190 --> 01:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
also means that the three current
 
01:05:51.750 --> 01:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
commissioners are each in one district
 
01:05:53.910 --> 01:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
it just happens
 
01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:55.589 align:start position:0%
it just happens
um

01:05:55.589 --> 01:05:55.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:55.599 --> 01:05:57.430 align:start position:0%
um
but

01:05:57.430 --> 01:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:05:59.589 --> 01:05:59.599 align:start position:0%
okay so that's
 
01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
very nice
 
01:06:04.230 --> 01:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
all right and then there's uh grafton
 
01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:11.349 align:start position:0%
 
but

01:06:11.349 --> 01:06:11.359 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:06:13.910 --> 01:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
you can you can look there's the map of
 
01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:15.270 align:start position:0%
you can you can look there's the map of
the

01:06:15.270 --> 01:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:06:16.870 --> 01:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
districts and the map of the
 
01:06:19.270 --> 01:06:19.280 align:start position:0%
commissioners and then the list actually
 
01:06:21.270 --> 01:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
they got the list of towns correct for
 
01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:23.029 align:start position:0%
they got the list of towns correct for
the

01:06:23.029 --> 01:06:23.039 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:06:24.870 --> 01:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
house districts
 
01:06:27.510 --> 01:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
so you can see that they're all
 
01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:28.950 align:start position:0%
so you can see that they're all
within

01:06:28.950 --> 01:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
within
 
01:06:30.630 --> 01:06:30.640 align:start position:0%
less than eight percent
 
01:06:33.910 --> 01:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
four point eight to minus three
 
01:06:36.789 --> 01:06:36.799 align:start position:0%
so that's a very close deviation for the
 
01:06:38.549 --> 01:06:38.559 align:start position:0%
house districts
 
01:06:41.029 --> 01:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
um they're all as small as i could make
 
01:06:43.510 --> 01:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
them and no floatarials except one in
 
01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:45.589 align:start position:0%
them and no floatarials except one in
lebanon

01:06:45.589 --> 01:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
lebanon
 
01:06:48.950 --> 01:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
littleton and monroe for two two seats
 
01:06:51.990 --> 01:06:52.000 align:start position:0%

bath benton haverhill and piermont for
two

01:07:01.750 --> 01:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:07:03.910 --> 01:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
ellsworth lincoln livermore thornton
 
01:07:07.029 --> 01:07:07.039 align:start position:0%
warren waterville and woodstock for two
 
01:07:09.349 --> 01:07:09.359 align:start position:0%
one for campton by itself
 
01:07:12.470 --> 01:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
two for plymouth by themselves
 
01:07:14.870 --> 01:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
and three in
 
01:07:17.589 --> 01:07:17.599 align:start position:0%
kanan dorchester enfield grafton groton
 
01:07:19.190 --> 01:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
and orange
 
01:07:21.029 --> 01:07:21.039 align:start position:0%
they specifically asked to be kept
 
01:07:21.039 --> 01:07:23.270 align:start position:0%
they specifically asked to be kept
together

01:07:23.270 --> 01:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:07:25.589 --> 01:07:25.599 align:start position:0%
but for three reps which is what they're
 
01:07:25.599 --> 01:07:26.549 align:start position:0%
but for three reps which is what they're
worth

01:07:26.549 --> 01:07:26.559 align:start position:0%
worth
 
01:07:31.750 --> 01:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:34.870 --> 01:07:34.880 align:start position:0%
the numbers just don't work
 
01:07:38.390 --> 01:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
orford romney and wentworth for one
 
01:07:41.029 --> 01:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
uh alexandria ashland bridgewater
 
01:07:45.670 --> 01:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:48.710 --> 01:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
hand over and lime together for four it
 
01:07:51.510 --> 01:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
can't be fewer because the
 
01:07:53.589 --> 01:07:53.599 align:start position:0%
the size of lime
 
01:07:54.549 --> 01:07:54.559 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:07:57.029 --> 01:07:57.039 align:start position:0%
each wart of lebanon gets a wrap and a
 
01:07:59.349 --> 01:07:59.359 align:start position:0%
floaterial over the three over the
 
01:08:00.710 --> 01:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
entire city
 
01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:11.750 --> 01:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
which comes out nicely
 
01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:13.990 align:start position:0%
which comes out nicely
and

01:08:13.990 --> 01:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:08:15.829 --> 01:08:15.839 align:start position:0%
and again on the on the map it got cut
 
01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
off a little bit at the bottom but
 
01:08:20.950 --> 01:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:22.550 align:start position:0%
 
i

01:08:22.550 --> 01:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
couldn't get onto the airport wi-fi
 
01:08:28.390 --> 01:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
properly so it took a while
 
01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:32.070 align:start position:0%
properly so it took a while
um

01:08:32.070 --> 01:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:35.189 align:start position:0%
 
but

01:08:35.189 --> 01:08:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:36.229 --> 01:08:36.239 align:start position:0%
and then you took a look at the
 
01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
commissioners commissioners yes um the
 
01:08:40.709 --> 01:08:40.719 align:start position:0%
one one district
 
01:08:43.510 --> 01:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
lebanon hanover and enfield
 
01:08:45.590 --> 01:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
which is
 
01:08:48.950 --> 01:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
30 000 people
 
01:08:51.030 --> 01:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
second district
 
01:08:53.030 --> 01:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
which is
 
01:08:55.749 --> 01:08:55.759 align:start position:0%
uh you can see the edge of it on the map
 
01:08:55.759 --> 01:08:56.550 align:start position:0%
uh you can see the edge of it on the map
it's

01:08:56.550 --> 01:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:58.149 align:start position:0%
it's
it

01:08:58.149 --> 01:08:58.159 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:09:01.189 --> 01:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
kanan is is the light triangle just next
 
01:09:03.669 --> 01:09:03.679 align:start position:0%
to hanover and then it goes up through
 
01:09:06.950 --> 01:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
dorchester wentworth warren ellsworth
 
01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
over to campton and then down so it's
 
01:09:11.189 --> 01:09:11.199 align:start position:0%
that section
 
01:09:12.709 --> 01:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
of the county
 
01:09:15.590 --> 01:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
and then the other district is lime
 
01:09:18.070 --> 01:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
orford pyramid haverhill
 
01:09:21.030 --> 01:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
and over to waterville valley
 
01:09:23.910 --> 01:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
and those two districts are again
 
01:09:26.789 --> 01:09:26.799 align:start position:0%
very similar in population
 
01:09:28.630 --> 01:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
not quite as close as merrimack but
 
01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:29.910 align:start position:0%
not quite as close as merrimack but
close

01:09:29.910 --> 01:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
close
 
01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:31.110 align:start position:0%
close
and

01:09:31.110 --> 01:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:09:33.030 --> 01:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
the deviation on the county is
 
01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:36.669 align:start position:0%
the deviation on the county is
approximately

01:09:36.669 --> 01:09:36.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:41.669 --> 01:09:41.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:41.679 --> 01:09:43.269 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:09:43.269 --> 01:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:09:45.349 --> 01:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
okay before i take questions
 
01:09:45.359 --> 01:09:47.669 align:start position:0%
okay before i take questions
um

01:09:47.669 --> 01:09:47.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:47.679 --> 01:09:49.910 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:09:49.910 --> 01:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:51.510 align:start position:0%
representative
piedra

01:09:51.510 --> 01:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
piedra
 
01:09:53.110 --> 01:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
i see you've got your computer open are
 
01:09:56.390 --> 01:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
you checking the website is it there yet
 
01:09:58.310 --> 01:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
can you take it can you take a check and
 
01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
let me know representative
 
01:10:19.350 --> 01:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:23.110 --> 01:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
could i suggest that we find a way to
 
01:10:25.110 --> 01:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
make sure
 
01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:26.070 align:start position:0%
make sure
that

01:10:26.070 --> 01:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:10:29.590 --> 01:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
the printing part doesn't fall on
 
01:10:32.630 --> 01:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
individual members of this committee we
 
01:10:35.830 --> 01:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
ought to have a very clear way
 
01:10:40.229 --> 01:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
to do this to do it in color in 2022 we
 
01:10:42.229 --> 01:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
ought to be able to do this in politics
 
01:10:56.310 --> 01:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:11.189 --> 01:11:11.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:13.270 --> 01:11:13.280 align:start position:0%
well and if you note on the agenda we
 
01:11:15.350 --> 01:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
have an issue in regards to getting maps
 
01:11:17.430 --> 01:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
to staff before meetings so that they
 
01:11:19.750 --> 01:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
can be copied and labeled yes i i sent
 
01:11:22.870 --> 01:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
it to to the staff but they
 
01:11:25.270 --> 01:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
but our assistant didn't have access to
 
01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
the program
 
01:11:28.790 --> 01:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
right so we'll we'll have to make sure
 
01:11:30.229 --> 01:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
that she gets it
 
01:11:31.510 --> 01:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
because you can print it from the
 
01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:32.630 align:start position:0%
because you can print it from the
program

01:11:32.630 --> 01:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:11:34.390 --> 01:11:34.400 align:start position:0%
in it quite
 
01:11:38.070 --> 01:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
quite much more easily than you can from
 
01:11:40.149 --> 01:11:40.159 align:start position:0%
from me trying to manipulate it into
 
01:11:42.310 --> 01:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
something that i can email so we may
 
01:11:44.310 --> 01:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
need to do i may need to deal with staff
 
01:11:46.550 --> 01:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
in regards to who do we need to get on
 
01:11:48.870 --> 01:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
these when they come in because i'm not
 
01:11:51.830 --> 01:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
sure that one assistant dealing with
 
01:11:54.070 --> 01:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
printing these is going to be sufficient
 
01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
still not there
 
01:11:56.400 --> 01:12:06.709 align:start position:0%
still not there
okay

01:12:06.709 --> 01:12:06.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:08.470 --> 01:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
yeah i have to apologize but this is the
 
01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:09.830 align:start position:0%
yeah i have to apologize but this is the
best

01:12:09.830 --> 01:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
best
 
01:12:11.830 --> 01:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire no apologies
 
01:12:15.910 --> 01:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
necessary um and it is the map so
 
01:12:17.830 --> 01:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
um representative mcguire has gone
 
01:12:20.149 --> 01:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
through using the program that we have
 
01:12:22.310 --> 01:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
um she's provided this information what
 
01:12:24.470 --> 01:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
does committee member send says to is
 
01:12:26.310 --> 01:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
this the information we're looking for
 
01:12:33.430 --> 01:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:35.910 --> 01:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
i am getting a consensus that this is
 
01:12:38.149 --> 01:12:38.159 align:start position:0%
this is what we need to get as compared
 
01:12:41.110 --> 01:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
to well i mean the option is just a map
 
01:12:44.070 --> 01:12:44.080 align:start position:0%
um the option is no map just numbers i
 
01:12:45.750 --> 01:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
mean people might
 
01:12:47.510 --> 01:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
want to submit other things but i'm
 
01:12:50.790 --> 01:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
looking for a minimum to staff for us to
 
01:12:53.510 --> 01:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
have at some point before a meeting so
 
01:12:55.830 --> 01:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
that we have in front of us what we're
 
01:12:57.110 --> 01:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
going to address
 
01:12:59.030 --> 01:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
representative lane
 
01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
i guess i i would
 
01:13:03.030 --> 01:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
like them before the meetings in this
 
01:13:05.830 --> 01:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
form so we can't compare them
 
01:13:08.310 --> 01:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
my other suggestion which i'm sure
 
01:13:09.430 --> 01:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
people aren't
 
01:13:11.270 --> 01:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
it's going to be mixed but
 
01:13:13.030 --> 01:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
we could do this
 
01:13:15.270 --> 01:13:15.280 align:start position:0%
and have it up and move it on the
 
01:13:17.030 --> 01:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
computer and have somebody show us why
 
01:13:19.350 --> 01:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
it doesn't work i mean it is possible to
 
01:13:22.229 --> 01:13:22.239 align:start position:0%
do that but i don't know
 
01:13:24.390 --> 01:13:24.400 align:start position:0%
i mean technology wise i don't know if
 
01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
that's too much to set up or if
 
01:13:28.310 --> 01:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
everybody doesn't have a computer you
 
01:13:30.310 --> 01:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
know maybe that's a problem but i know
 
01:13:31.910 --> 01:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
that you can move them around and we can
 
01:13:34.310 --> 01:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
do it on zoom and share the screen and
 
01:13:36.870 --> 01:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
move it around and show how so she could
 
01:13:39.030 --> 01:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
show us what she did and
 
01:13:41.910 --> 01:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
why having say one town as a separate
 
01:13:44.229 --> 01:13:44.239 align:start position:0%
one didn't work i i just
 
01:13:47.430 --> 01:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
i think if members i am not
 
01:13:50.229 --> 01:13:50.239 align:start position:0%
going to go down that route because
 
01:13:50.239 --> 01:13:52.070 align:start position:0%
going to go down that route because
um

01:13:52.070 --> 01:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:53.750 --> 01:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure everybody has the same
 
01:13:55.750 --> 01:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
access to computers
 
01:13:57.270 --> 01:13:57.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to have substitutes on
 
01:13:59.430 --> 01:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
committees i know i'm not going to be
 
01:14:01.110 --> 01:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
able to have a computer in front of me
 
01:14:03.430 --> 01:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
and follow it and and share the meeting
 
01:14:04.790 --> 01:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
and go through it
 
01:14:06.470 --> 01:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:14:09.030 --> 01:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
there are issues just as representative
 
01:14:11.189 --> 01:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
smith indicated it was helpful to label
 
01:14:13.110 --> 01:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
it i'm i'm concerned when we're talking
 
01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
about computer screens and being able to
 
01:14:17.430 --> 01:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
follow what goes on i am going to allow
 
01:14:19.350 --> 01:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
members to have computers in front of
 
01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:20.229 align:start position:0%
members to have computers in front of
them

01:14:20.229 --> 01:14:20.239 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:14:22.630 --> 01:14:22.640 align:start position:0%
for this i am not raising issues with
 
01:14:25.270 --> 01:14:25.280 align:start position:0%
that but i know not everybody has a
 
01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:28.640 align:start position:0%
computer in front of them so
 
01:14:31.750 --> 01:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
i i get that approach and i understand
 
01:14:33.830 --> 01:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
it but hopefully by getting it to
 
01:14:35.990 --> 01:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
committee members before the meeting and
 
01:14:38.630 --> 01:14:38.640 align:start position:0%
we need to talk about when
 
01:14:40.950 --> 01:14:40.960 align:start position:0%
if there are particular deviation issues
 
01:14:42.550 --> 01:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
that you want to address you'll have an
 
01:14:45.189 --> 01:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do so
 
01:14:47.350 --> 01:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
i will also note that going through
 
01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:48.709 align:start position:0%
i will also note that going through
these

01:14:48.709 --> 01:14:48.719 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:14:51.430 --> 01:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
i think took about a half an hour does
 
01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:52.229 align:start position:0%
i think took about a half an hour does
that

01:14:52.229 --> 01:14:52.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:14:55.270 --> 01:14:55.280 align:start position:0%
sound about i wrote down i thought about
 
01:14:57.350 --> 01:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
writing down what time we started
 
01:14:59.270 --> 01:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
actually i wrote down
 
01:15:01.510 --> 01:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
9 30.
 
01:15:04.709 --> 01:15:04.719 align:start position:0%
so it took an hour and a half
 
01:15:07.270 --> 01:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at somebody in the does
 
01:15:08.709 --> 01:15:08.719 align:start position:0%
anybody have any idea what time we
 
01:15:10.070 --> 01:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
started talking about representative
 
01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:11.350 align:start position:0%
started talking about representative
mcguire

01:15:11.350 --> 01:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
mcguire
 
01:15:12.790 --> 01:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
we didn't start the meeting until 10 so
 
01:15:15.430 --> 01:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
it was 10 30. i'm sure we started this
 
01:15:16.709 --> 01:15:16.719 align:start position:0%
meeting around
 
01:15:19.189 --> 01:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
20 after 20 maybe maybe 30 after it all
 
01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
right i'm raising that so it was at
 
01:15:23.270 --> 01:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
least a half an hour to go through this
 
01:15:25.350 --> 01:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
without any discussion on alternative
 
01:15:27.669 --> 01:15:27.679 align:start position:0%
maps so i'm raising that so people have
 
01:15:29.350 --> 01:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
an idea of how much time this is going
 
01:15:31.510 --> 01:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
to take to go through these
 
01:15:36.149 --> 01:15:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:38.229 --> 01:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
so other comments on the on the
 
01:15:38.239 --> 01:15:39.510 align:start position:0%
so other comments on the on the
presentation

01:15:39.510 --> 01:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
01:15:40.950 --> 01:15:40.960 align:start position:0%
representative smith i'm sorry you had
 
01:16:16.470 --> 01:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:24.390 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:16:24.390 --> 01:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:26.630 --> 01:16:26.640 align:start position:0%
my inclination would be
 
01:16:29.350 --> 01:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
24 hours and here's why we're probably
 
01:16:31.189 --> 01:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
starting our meetings on tuesday or
 
01:16:31.199 --> 01:16:32.470 align:start position:0%
starting our meetings on tuesday or
wednesday

01:16:32.470 --> 01:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
wednesday
 
01:16:34.149 --> 01:16:34.159 align:start position:0%
if this is anything like me getting a
 
01:16:36.070 --> 01:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
report done for the court
 
01:16:38.229 --> 01:16:38.239 align:start position:0%
or papers done for school it will be
 
01:16:40.229 --> 01:16:40.239 align:start position:0%
done the weekend before
 
01:16:43.510 --> 01:16:43.520 align:start position:0%
which means staff will get it on monday
 
01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:44.550 align:start position:0%
which means staff will get it on monday
and

01:16:44.550 --> 01:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:46.070 align:start position:0%
and
um

01:16:46.070 --> 01:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:48.630 --> 01:16:48.640 align:start position:0%
so 48 hours is just not going to make it
 
01:16:52.550 --> 01:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
for for a wednesday meeting so
 
01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:54.390 align:start position:0%
for for a wednesday meeting so
okay

01:16:54.390 --> 01:16:54.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:16:58.070 --> 01:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
no no i i i agree that unless we recess
 
01:16:59.750 --> 01:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
so people can go do something by
 
01:17:01.510 --> 01:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
consensus and come back to look at
 
01:17:03.910 --> 01:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
something in the course of deliberations
 
01:17:05.990 --> 01:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
i can see that happening but
 
01:17:08.470 --> 01:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
um as far as maps to be presented i
 
01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:09.350 align:start position:0%
um as far as maps to be presented i
think

01:17:09.350 --> 01:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:17:11.350 --> 01:17:11.360 align:start position:0%
i understand wanting to have them but
 
01:17:13.990 --> 01:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to consider the workflow and
 
01:17:15.830 --> 01:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
if they're available before 24 hours
 
01:17:17.110 --> 01:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
there's no reason why they can't be
 
01:17:18.950 --> 01:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
distributed but
 
01:17:21.430 --> 01:17:21.440 align:start position:0%
i think the cutoff needs to be 24 hours
 
01:17:23.030 --> 01:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
representative wilhelm
 
01:17:25.110 --> 01:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh since we're
 
01:17:27.669 --> 01:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
talking about making maps available in
 
01:17:30.790 --> 01:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
advance of meetings i'm curious if there
 
01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:32.229 align:start position:0%
advance of meetings i'm curious if there
is

01:17:32.229 --> 01:17:32.239 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:17:34.390 --> 01:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
an amount of time that you think is
 
01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:35.990 align:start position:0%
an amount of time that you think is
acceptable

01:17:35.990 --> 01:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
acceptable
 
01:17:38.310 --> 01:17:38.320 align:start position:0%
or that is a goal for making maps
 
01:17:40.550 --> 01:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
available ahead of the public hearing
 
01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
well that's not going to be able to
 
01:17:44.149 --> 01:17:44.159 align:start position:0%
occur until we have a consensus on what
 
01:17:45.669 --> 01:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
is going to happen and that won't occur
 
01:17:47.910 --> 01:17:47.920 align:start position:0%
till the week before the public input
 
01:17:49.990 --> 01:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
sessions in repsol so
 
01:17:51.189 --> 01:17:51.199 align:start position:0%
it will be
 
01:17:51.199 --> 01:17:52.149 align:start position:0%
it will be
then

01:17:52.149 --> 01:17:52.159 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:17:53.910 --> 01:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
we're not i'm
 
01:17:55.910 --> 01:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
to put maps up people are free to post
 
01:17:58.310 --> 01:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
what maps they want as far as testimony
 
01:18:00.790 --> 01:18:00.800 align:start position:0%
but as far as committee
 
01:18:02.709 --> 01:18:02.719 align:start position:0%
product that will be the week before the
 
01:18:04.149 --> 01:18:04.159 align:start position:0%
reps hall meeting
 
01:18:06.149 --> 01:18:06.159 align:start position:0%
that's why we're scheduling probably two
 
01:18:10.229 --> 01:18:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:12.470 --> 01:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
representative lane um
 
01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:13.590 align:start position:0%
representative lane um
sorry

01:18:13.590 --> 01:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
01:18:16.070 --> 01:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
to go back to scheduling are we meeting
 
01:18:17.430 --> 01:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
next week
 
01:18:19.189 --> 01:18:19.199 align:start position:0%
i had originally
 
01:18:21.669 --> 01:18:21.679 align:start position:0%
thought we would meet next week but as i
 
01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
ran through this schedule again and
 
01:18:25.430 --> 01:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
realized that
 
01:18:27.830 --> 01:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
mapping a substantial mapping my
 
01:18:31.030 --> 01:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
suspicion still needs to occur
 
01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:31.830 align:start position:0%
suspicion still needs to occur
i

01:18:31.830 --> 01:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
am reassessing my
 
01:18:37.350 --> 01:18:37.360 align:start position:0%
thought that a meeting next week would
 
01:18:40.390 --> 01:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
be of value given that we seem we've
 
01:18:42.709 --> 01:18:42.719 align:start position:0%
gone through a sample
 
01:18:45.830 --> 01:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
and where we want maps to be submitted i
 
01:18:47.910 --> 01:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
am thinking that it makes more sense to
 
01:18:50.390 --> 01:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
let people spend their time next week
 
01:18:52.550 --> 01:18:52.560 align:start position:0%
working on maps and make sure that
 
01:18:55.030 --> 01:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
they're all into staff
 
01:18:56.709 --> 01:18:56.719 align:start position:0%
so that
 
01:18:58.630 --> 01:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
we can get them
 
01:19:01.189 --> 01:19:01.199 align:start position:0%
um before our meeting on wednesday the
 
01:19:01.199 --> 01:19:02.229 align:start position:0%
um before our meeting on wednesday the
third

01:19:02.229 --> 01:19:02.239 align:start position:0%
third
 
01:19:04.630 --> 01:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
okay unless somebody has a specific i
 
01:19:06.870 --> 01:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
mean tentatively i had mentally thought
 
01:19:08.550 --> 01:19:08.560 align:start position:0%
of about that we would have a meeting
 
01:19:09.990 --> 01:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
next week but
 
01:19:13.350 --> 01:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
i want to make sure if we're coming in
 
01:19:14.630 --> 01:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
it's for
 
01:19:16.390 --> 01:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
a valid purpose i stick to drag
 
01:19:18.310 --> 01:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
everybody in i just wanted to get it on
 
01:19:20.709 --> 01:19:20.719 align:start position:0%
my schedules as soon as well i mean let
 
01:19:22.229 --> 01:19:22.239 align:start position:0%
me ask because originally i had thought
 
01:19:23.350 --> 01:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
we were going to need it but i'm
 
01:19:25.189 --> 01:19:25.199 align:start position:0%
thinking that given the amount of maps
 
01:19:27.110 --> 01:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
and preparation that needs to occur that
 
01:19:28.709 --> 01:19:28.719 align:start position:0%
we're better off scheduling a couple of
 
01:19:30.229 --> 01:19:30.239 align:start position:0%
days together
 
01:19:32.390 --> 01:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
as compared to
 
01:19:34.070 --> 01:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
i'm worried that if we do it next week
 
01:19:36.630 --> 01:19:36.640 align:start position:0%
and we set maps to be done that then the
 
01:19:39.110 --> 01:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
next week somebody will have another map
 
01:19:40.550 --> 01:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
because they didn't get to it and i'd
 
01:19:42.390 --> 01:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
rather have everybody be able to get to
 
01:19:44.550 --> 01:19:44.560 align:start position:0%
everything they want to so we can have
 
01:19:47.030 --> 01:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
it all together
 
01:19:48.870 --> 01:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
that's fine with me
 
01:19:50.550 --> 01:19:50.560 align:start position:0%
the other alternative because i had
 
01:19:53.990 --> 01:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
thought perhaps to work on it today
 
01:19:55.990 --> 01:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
is to just come in to do county
 
01:19:59.510 --> 01:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner maps next week but
 
01:20:00.950 --> 01:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that makes a lot of sense
 
01:20:02.470 --> 01:20:02.480 align:start position:0%
to come in to just do a county
 
01:20:05.430 --> 01:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner map maps for every county
 
01:20:30.629 --> 01:20:30.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:58.550 --> 01:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
i'll see what i can get done
 
01:21:01.189 --> 01:21:01.199 align:start position:0%
yeah representative lane um thank you so
 
01:21:03.270 --> 01:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
on the third and fourth is it safe to
 
01:21:05.350 --> 01:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
say we'll probably start 9 30 or 10 and
 
01:21:07.510 --> 01:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
basically go the whole day
 
01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
should we just block off the whole day
 
01:21:11.030 --> 01:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
or what i would have to say i think
 
01:21:13.350 --> 01:21:13.360 align:start position:0%
that's probably reasonable okay
 
01:21:15.270 --> 01:21:15.280 align:start position:0%
let's start at 10
 
01:21:16.629 --> 01:21:16.639 align:start position:0%
because we know there's going to be
 
01:21:19.990 --> 01:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:22.709 --> 01:21:22.719 align:start position:0%
before we sit down
 
01:21:25.350 --> 01:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
so let's plan on 10 o'clock on the third
 
01:21:30.629 --> 01:21:30.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:31.830 --> 01:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:34.550 align:start position:0%
all right
um

01:21:34.550 --> 01:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:37.110 --> 01:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
there is a bill i'm going to move on to
 
01:21:39.430 --> 01:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
the next thing that i had on my agenda
 
01:21:43.669 --> 01:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
there is a bill hb 55 in regards to the
 
01:21:45.430 --> 01:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
state party
 
01:21:47.590 --> 01:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
representative barry do you have any
 
01:21:49.270 --> 01:21:49.280 align:start position:0%
expectation of something that might be
 
01:21:51.990 --> 01:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
happening with hb 55 uh yes madam
 
01:21:55.350 --> 01:21:55.360 align:start position:0%
chairman um so i've been looking into um
 
01:21:55.360 --> 01:21:57.110 align:start position:0%
chairman um so i've been looking into um
the

01:21:57.110 --> 01:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:21:58.709 --> 01:21:58.719 align:start position:0%
delegates to the state party convention
 
01:22:01.510 --> 01:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
so a a a really brief history for those
 
01:22:02.740 --> 01:22:02.750 align:start position:0%
watching at home
 
01:22:02.750 --> 01:22:03.990 align:start position:0%
watching at home
[Music]

01:22:03.990 --> 01:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:22:06.229 --> 01:22:06.239 align:start position:0%
we haven't codified in rsa
 
01:22:08.950 --> 01:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
how political parties are supposed to
 
01:22:11.350 --> 01:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
organize um
 
01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:12.310 align:start position:0%
organize um
their

01:22:12.310 --> 01:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:22:14.790 --> 01:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
basically their party structure um
 
01:22:17.830 --> 01:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
parties have the option to
 
01:22:20.629 --> 01:22:20.639 align:start position:0%
opt out of this process
 
01:22:22.950 --> 01:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
the democratic party has opted out of
 
01:22:24.950 --> 01:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
this process the republican party is
 
01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:25.750 align:start position:0%
this process the republican party is
still

01:22:25.750 --> 01:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
still
 
01:22:28.070 --> 01:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
in this process
 
01:22:31.110 --> 01:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
so for the way it works is
 
01:22:32.790 --> 01:22:32.800 align:start position:0%
there are delegates to the state party
 
01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:33.990 align:start position:0%
there are delegates to the state party
convention

01:22:33.990 --> 01:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
convention
 
01:22:36.149 --> 01:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
each town is guaranteed their own
 
01:22:36.159 --> 01:22:37.430 align:start position:0%
each town is guaranteed their own
delegate

01:22:37.430 --> 01:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
delegate
 
01:22:40.149 --> 01:22:40.159 align:start position:0%
those state party delegates
 
01:22:43.430 --> 01:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
combine with the party nominees for all
 
01:22:45.990 --> 01:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
the offices so everyone in this room is
 
01:22:47.990 --> 01:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
a would be a delegate to a state party
 
01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:49.189 align:start position:0%
a would be a delegate to a state party
convention

01:22:49.189 --> 01:22:49.199 align:start position:0%
convention
 
01:22:50.709 --> 01:22:50.719 align:start position:0%
coupled with people who are elected
 
01:22:54.229 --> 01:22:54.239 align:start position:0%
purely for delegates so hb 55 deals with
 
01:22:55.350 --> 01:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
the people that are elected purely for
 
01:22:55.360 --> 01:22:57.270 align:start position:0%
the people that are elected purely for
delegates

01:22:57.270 --> 01:22:57.280 align:start position:0%
delegates
 
01:23:00.070 --> 01:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of issues with this
 
01:23:00.080 --> 01:23:01.590 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of issues with this
process

01:23:01.590 --> 01:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:23:03.590 --> 01:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
political parties are considered
 
01:23:05.669 --> 01:23:05.679 align:start position:0%
basically semi-public organizations
 
01:23:07.430 --> 01:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
they're they're half private they're
 
01:23:09.110 --> 01:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
half public they're they're they're
 
01:23:11.590 --> 01:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
privately run but they have an impact on
 
01:23:13.430 --> 01:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
obviously public elections
 
01:23:15.189 --> 01:23:15.199 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:23:17.350 --> 01:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
there there are questions raised as to
 
01:23:20.550 --> 01:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
whether or not the current um delegates
 
01:23:23.030 --> 01:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
would actually sustain sustain a legal
 
01:23:24.870 --> 01:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
challenge because they are not in any
 
01:23:26.629 --> 01:23:26.639 align:start position:0%
which way proportional
 
01:23:28.149 --> 01:23:28.159 align:start position:0%
in fact it is a complete violation of
 
01:23:31.110 --> 01:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
one man one vote however it is a private
 
01:23:33.510 --> 01:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
organization so um
 
01:23:34.950 --> 01:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
there's there's a very there's a lot of
 
01:23:37.189 --> 01:23:37.199 align:start position:0%
different court cases out that surrounds
 
01:23:39.750 --> 01:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
um how parties operate how they nominate
 
01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:40.870 align:start position:0%
um how parties operate how they nominate
um

01:23:40.870 --> 01:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:42.870 --> 01:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh the one that i cite all the time is
 
01:23:45.350 --> 01:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
actually it's a california versus uh
 
01:23:47.270 --> 01:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
state democratic party which the state
 
01:23:49.669 --> 01:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
democratic party of california sued um i
 
01:23:51.189 --> 01:23:51.199 align:start position:0%
want to say it was a couple
 
01:23:53.030 --> 01:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
it was a couple decades ago basically
 
01:23:54.550 --> 01:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
telling the state of california that
 
01:23:56.229 --> 01:23:56.239 align:start position:0%
they are a private organization that
 
01:23:57.910 --> 01:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
they can control how they nominate their
 
01:23:59.830 --> 01:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
candidates for ballot access um the
 
01:24:01.750 --> 01:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
supreme court actually ruled with the
 
01:24:03.270 --> 01:24:03.280 align:start position:0%
california democratic party and says yes
 
01:24:05.189 --> 01:24:05.199 align:start position:0%
you are a private organization you can
 
01:24:06.870 --> 01:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
control your process
 
01:24:09.590 --> 01:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
so we flash to new hampshire and we have
 
01:24:12.149 --> 01:24:12.159 align:start position:0%
this interesting situation where we have
 
01:24:13.189 --> 01:24:13.199 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:24:13.199 --> 01:24:14.709 align:start position:0%
the state
dictating

01:24:14.709 --> 01:24:14.719 align:start position:0%
dictating
 
01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
to political parties how to organize
 
01:24:18.870 --> 01:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
giving them the option to opt out but by
 
01:24:21.270 --> 01:24:21.280 align:start position:0%
having the state control it it raises i
 
01:24:22.870 --> 01:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
believe constitutional questions about
 
01:24:25.270 --> 01:24:25.280 align:start position:0%
one man one vote uh because the state is
 
01:24:27.270 --> 01:24:27.280 align:start position:0%
actually putting forward districts that
 
01:24:29.510 --> 01:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
are not in any which way proportional
 
01:24:32.310 --> 01:24:32.320 align:start position:0%
represents a representative um a town of
 
01:24:33.990 --> 01:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
300 gets the same
 
01:24:35.750 --> 01:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh is guaranteed the same minimum
 
01:24:38.149 --> 01:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
representation as a town of 3 400. so
 
01:24:40.149 --> 01:24:40.159 align:start position:0%
that obviously creates problems
 
01:24:41.990 --> 01:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
so i went to
 
01:24:43.350 --> 01:24:43.360 align:start position:0%
i can't speak for my colleagues on the
 
01:24:44.149 --> 01:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
other side of the aisle they're not
 
01:24:45.430 --> 01:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
involved in this process but obviously
 
01:24:47.830 --> 01:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
happy to hear their input
 
01:24:49.910 --> 01:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
i went to um the republican party i said
 
01:24:51.669 --> 01:24:51.679 align:start position:0%
hey you know we have this this problem
 
01:24:51.679 --> 01:24:52.950 align:start position:0%
hey you know we have this this problem
of

01:24:52.950 --> 01:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:24:55.110 --> 01:24:55.120 align:start position:0%
one day we might be sued and i don't
 
01:24:56.870 --> 01:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
know if we would survive the challenge
 
01:24:58.629 --> 01:24:58.639 align:start position:0%
once again i don't know because it's a
 
01:25:01.510 --> 01:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
semi public organization i don't know
 
01:25:02.709 --> 01:25:02.719 align:start position:0%
don't know which way the courts would
 
01:25:04.470 --> 01:25:04.480 align:start position:0%
come down i could honest to god i could
 
01:25:06.870 --> 01:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
see it going either way uh
 
01:25:08.709 --> 01:25:08.719 align:start position:0%
you know we have this we have this this
 
01:25:09.990 --> 01:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
issue what do you want to do in this
 
01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.229 align:start position:0%
issue what do you want to do in this
situation

01:25:12.229 --> 01:25:12.239 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:25:14.629 --> 01:25:14.639 align:start position:0%
and it it appears that the solution is
 
01:25:16.390 --> 01:25:16.400 align:start position:0%
to get rid of the
 
01:25:19.030 --> 01:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
the delegates all together and leave in
 
01:25:20.310 --> 01:25:20.320 align:start position:0%
the clause
 
01:25:22.950 --> 01:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
that says that
 
01:25:25.430 --> 01:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
the nom the party nominees
 
01:25:27.189 --> 01:25:27.199 align:start position:0%
will remain delegates but the state will
 
01:25:29.669 --> 01:25:29.679 align:start position:0%
no longer operate the underlying
 
01:25:29.679 --> 01:25:31.750 align:start position:0%
no longer operate the underlying
districts

01:25:31.750 --> 01:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
districts
 
01:25:33.270 --> 01:25:33.280 align:start position:0%
and i said i would take that back to the
 
01:25:34.550 --> 01:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
committee and present that to the
 
01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:35.510 align:start position:0%
committee and present that to the
committee

01:25:35.510 --> 01:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:25:37.189 --> 01:25:37.199 align:start position:0%
there's a variety of reasons why i
 
01:25:40.550 --> 01:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
personally believe it's it's a good idea
 
01:25:42.950 --> 01:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
the first of which is i do have a
 
01:25:45.990 --> 01:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
a philosophical issue with with asking
 
01:25:48.470 --> 01:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire taxpayer to fund an
 
01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:49.510 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire taxpayer to fund an
election

01:25:49.510 --> 01:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
election
 
01:25:53.030 --> 01:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
for a private organization
 
01:25:54.310 --> 01:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
you can make the argument that we do
 
01:25:56.709 --> 01:25:56.719 align:start position:0%
that via primaries but i think in that
 
01:25:58.390 --> 01:25:58.400 align:start position:0%
situation the parties are operating more
 
01:25:59.910 --> 01:25:59.920 align:start position:0%
in their public capacity and less in
 
01:26:01.590 --> 01:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
their private capacity
 
01:26:03.990 --> 01:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
in my opinion when the state is funding
 
01:26:05.270 --> 01:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
an election
 
01:26:07.510 --> 01:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
to elect delegates who are then electing
 
01:26:09.510 --> 01:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
state committee members that that is a
 
01:26:11.590 --> 01:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
largely private
 
01:26:13.590 --> 01:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
function and you have a philosophical
 
01:26:16.310 --> 01:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
issue with asking um taxpayers across
 
01:26:17.910 --> 01:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
the political spectrum to fund an
 
01:26:19.270 --> 01:26:19.280 align:start position:0%
election that is currently being
 
01:26:21.110 --> 01:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
exclusively used by my party the
 
01:26:23.270 --> 01:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
republican party
 
01:26:25.830 --> 01:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
so that is where that is where i am at
 
01:26:28.149 --> 01:26:28.159 align:start position:0%
on hb 55 if i was to vote today i would
 
01:26:30.629 --> 01:26:30.639 align:start position:0%
vote to abolish the districts entirely
 
01:26:32.870 --> 01:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
um i would leave the rsa in there so
 
01:26:35.189 --> 01:26:35.199 align:start position:0%
that particularly the republican party
 
01:26:37.270 --> 01:26:37.280 align:start position:0%
who's still using this process can still
 
01:26:38.790 --> 01:26:38.800 align:start position:0%
have their process intact of having
 
01:26:41.110 --> 01:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
their delegates which would be
 
01:26:43.110 --> 01:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
anyone who has won a party nomination
 
01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:44.790 align:start position:0%
anyone who has won a party nomination
contest

01:26:44.790 --> 01:26:44.800 align:start position:0%
contest
 
01:26:46.310 --> 01:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
and that wouldn't severely compromise
 
01:26:48.709 --> 01:26:48.719 align:start position:0%
the party but would also in my opinion
 
01:26:50.310 --> 01:26:50.320 align:start position:0%
relieve the new hampshire taxpayer of
 
01:26:51.990 --> 01:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
having to fund an election for what i
 
01:26:55.189 --> 01:26:55.199 align:start position:0%
view as a private organization
 
01:26:57.350 --> 01:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
thank you representative comments
 
01:26:59.189 --> 01:26:59.199 align:start position:0%
this would be house bill
 
01:26:59.199 --> 01:27:01.669 align:start position:0%
this would be house bill
55

01:27:01.669 --> 01:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
55
 
01:27:03.669 --> 01:27:03.679 align:start position:0%
and it deals with
 
01:27:05.990 --> 01:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
rsa 662
 
01:27:09.030 --> 01:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:10.950 --> 01:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
representative lane
 
01:27:12.709 --> 01:27:12.719 align:start position:0%
um i appreciate this because we've had
 
01:27:15.350 --> 01:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
this bill before an election law
 
01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:16.229 align:start position:0%
this bill before an election law
but

01:27:16.229 --> 01:27:16.239 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:27:18.390 --> 01:27:18.400 align:start position:0%
this may be a dumb question why are we
 
01:27:20.870 --> 01:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
considering it in this committee and why
 
01:27:23.030 --> 01:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
are we discussing it i'm sorry i don't
 
01:27:25.270 --> 01:27:25.280 align:start position:0%
because it's actually a districting bill
 
01:27:27.750 --> 01:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you theoretically it should
 
01:27:30.870 --> 01:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
be getting based on
 
01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:32.070 align:start position:0%
be getting based on
factors

01:27:32.070 --> 01:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
factors
 
01:27:34.229 --> 01:27:34.239 align:start position:0%
rising out of the census it just hasn't
 
01:27:34.239 --> 01:27:36.950 align:start position:0%
rising out of the census it just hasn't
been

01:27:36.950 --> 01:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:38.550 --> 01:27:38.560 align:start position:0%
and maybe it will save us time in
 
01:27:40.709 --> 01:27:40.719 align:start position:0%
election law
 
01:27:42.550 --> 01:27:42.560 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire
 
01:27:44.870 --> 01:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
yes thank you i would have to agree with
 
01:27:46.709 --> 01:27:46.719 align:start position:0%
representative barry that this is
 
01:27:49.430 --> 01:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
probably not the best way to do it
 
01:27:51.830 --> 01:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
and having worked with a large number of
 
01:27:54.310 --> 01:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
people there is major confusion among
 
01:27:56.870 --> 01:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
the populous on what's a delegate and
 
01:27:59.189 --> 01:27:59.199 align:start position:0%
why do we bother electing them
 
01:28:00.629 --> 01:28:00.639 align:start position:0%
and therefore
 
01:28:02.709 --> 01:28:02.719 align:start position:0%
i tend to think it might be a good idea
 
01:28:04.629 --> 01:28:04.639 align:start position:0%
to let the party figure out what they
 
01:28:07.430 --> 01:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
want to do for
 
01:28:09.990 --> 01:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
delegates other than nominees and stay
 
01:28:12.149 --> 01:28:12.159 align:start position:0%
out of it as have the legislature stay
 
01:28:14.149 --> 01:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
out of it
 
01:28:16.229 --> 01:28:16.239 align:start position:0%
so it it has been the determination that
 
01:28:18.070 --> 01:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
this can become before this committee
 
01:28:20.709 --> 01:28:20.719 align:start position:0%
from a jurisdictional issue so
 
01:28:20.719 --> 01:28:22.229 align:start position:0%
from a jurisdictional issue so
um

01:28:22.229 --> 01:28:22.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:25.669 --> 01:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
unless there's further objection i'm
 
01:28:27.510 --> 01:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
representative weber
 
01:28:29.510 --> 01:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
i just have a comment and it comes out
 
01:28:31.350 --> 01:28:31.360 align:start position:0%
of bewilderment
 
01:28:34.149 --> 01:28:34.159 align:start position:0%
because it what i'm hearing people say
 
01:28:36.870 --> 01:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
and i know nothing about the process
 
01:28:38.070 --> 01:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
is that it's
 
01:28:40.229 --> 01:28:40.239 align:start position:0%
very difficult and inconvenient and
 
01:28:42.629 --> 01:28:42.639 align:start position:0%
confusing and i just wonder
 
01:28:45.990 --> 01:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
if the easiest solution isn't for the
 
01:28:49.030 --> 01:28:49.040 align:start position:0%
other party to opt out as well and do it
 
01:28:51.669 --> 01:28:51.679 align:start position:0%
at their pleasure and
 
01:28:53.590 --> 01:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
as the democrats do
 
01:28:55.350 --> 01:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
and then we could simply repeal the
 
01:28:57.510 --> 01:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
statute and have one less statute on the
 
01:28:57.520 --> 01:28:58.470 align:start position:0%
statute and have one less statute on the
books

01:28:58.470 --> 01:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
books
 
01:29:00.550 --> 01:29:00.560 align:start position:0%
i i just put that forward i don't want
 
01:29:02.550 --> 01:29:02.560 align:start position:0%
to interfere in
 
01:29:05.270 --> 01:29:05.280 align:start position:0%
a process that i'm not involved in but
 
01:29:07.270 --> 01:29:07.280 align:start position:0%
listening to this discussion that's what
 
01:29:09.110 --> 01:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
popped into my head so i thought i'd let
 
01:29:11.030 --> 01:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
it come out of my mouth thank you
 
01:29:13.270 --> 01:29:13.280 align:start position:0%
representative barry uh yes to respond
 
01:29:15.669 --> 01:29:15.679 align:start position:0%
to the representative's questions um so
 
01:29:19.270 --> 01:29:19.280 align:start position:0%
this process exists for any party um you
 
01:29:21.110 --> 01:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
know that would that would opt to use it
 
01:29:23.110 --> 01:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
so when we make these changes on a state
 
01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:23.990 align:start position:0%
so when we make these changes on a state
level

01:29:23.990 --> 01:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
level
 
01:29:25.910 --> 01:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
i don't think waiting for
 
01:29:28.149 --> 01:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
a private entity to withdraw
 
01:29:28.159 --> 01:29:29.030 align:start position:0%
a private entity to withdraw
um

01:29:29.030 --> 01:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:32.070 --> 01:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
is wise we make you know in theory we
 
01:29:33.590 --> 01:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
are making a decision that would impact
 
01:29:35.430 --> 01:29:35.440 align:start position:0%
all political parties in the state not
 
01:29:37.189 --> 01:29:37.199 align:start position:0%
just the republican party currently it
 
01:29:38.709 --> 01:29:38.719 align:start position:0%
would underneath its current structure
 
01:29:40.550 --> 01:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
it would only affect them but in in
 
01:29:42.310 --> 01:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
theory the democratic state committee
 
01:29:43.750 --> 01:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
could meet and say that they want back
 
01:29:44.950 --> 01:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
into the system and then they would be
 
01:29:46.550 --> 01:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
using these
 
01:29:48.550 --> 01:29:48.560 align:start position:0%
what i i believe would be deemed
 
01:29:51.189 --> 01:29:51.199 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional districts um so i i
 
01:29:53.110 --> 01:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
think it's i think it's uh i i don't
 
01:29:55.189 --> 01:29:55.199 align:start position:0%
want to wait um
 
01:29:57.030 --> 01:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh but i think from a you know when we
 
01:29:58.870 --> 01:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
operate we operate for everyone right i
 
01:30:00.470 --> 01:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
don't just operate as republican i i
 
01:30:03.110 --> 01:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
represent all all people in my district
 
01:30:05.270 --> 01:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
um and we have to make decisions as a
 
01:30:06.950 --> 01:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
state and i think it's the best thing to
 
01:30:07.990 --> 01:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
do is to
 
01:30:08.950 --> 01:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:30:10.950 --> 01:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
the the horrific situation that i see
 
01:30:13.590 --> 01:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
the apocalyptic situation is that
 
01:30:16.149 --> 01:30:16.159 align:start position:0%
someone sues over these districts
 
01:30:17.990 --> 01:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
and then the attorney general's office
 
01:30:20.470 --> 01:30:20.480 align:start position:0%
has to then finance a defense because
 
01:30:22.790 --> 01:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
this is state law and now not only do we
 
01:30:24.709 --> 01:30:24.719 align:start position:0%
have the taxpayer funding an election
 
01:30:26.470 --> 01:30:26.480 align:start position:0%
but now we have the taxpayers funding a
 
01:30:28.709 --> 01:30:28.719 align:start position:0%
legal defense for a private entity um i
 
01:30:30.149 --> 01:30:30.159 align:start position:0%
i think it's best just to take it all
 
01:30:32.149 --> 01:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
off the table
 
01:30:34.149 --> 01:30:34.159 align:start position:0%
most of it off most of it off the table
 
01:30:36.070 --> 01:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
okay because that's your proposal as i
 
01:30:37.669 --> 01:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
understood it
 
01:30:39.750 --> 01:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
correct okay
 
01:30:43.110 --> 01:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:45.110 --> 01:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so i mean to be
 
01:30:47.110 --> 01:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
clear the bills before this committee
 
01:30:48.390 --> 01:30:48.400 align:start position:0%
because we're responsible for
 
01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:49.910 align:start position:0%
because we're responsible for
redistricting

01:30:49.910 --> 01:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
redistricting
 
01:30:51.990 --> 01:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
i can't let these districts stay the way
 
01:30:53.510 --> 01:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
they are because they're clearly skewed
 
01:30:55.030 --> 01:30:55.040 align:start position:0%
they're clearly unfair they're clearly
 
01:30:56.629 --> 01:30:56.639 align:start position:0%
not representative of equal levels of
 
01:30:56.639 --> 01:30:57.990 align:start position:0%
not representative of equal levels of
population

01:30:57.990 --> 01:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
population
 
01:31:00.709 --> 01:31:00.719 align:start position:0%
and i agree with representative berry i
 
01:31:01.910 --> 01:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
don't know why the state would be doing
 
01:31:04.310 --> 01:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
this so we would spend time on it
 
01:31:06.870 --> 01:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
waiting for the party to do something
 
01:31:08.950 --> 01:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
they're organizing their work i think
 
01:31:10.870 --> 01:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
the best way to convey a sense of
 
01:31:10.880 --> 01:31:11.990 align:start position:0%
the best way to convey a sense of
urgency

01:31:11.990 --> 01:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
urgency
 
01:31:13.910 --> 01:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
is to
 
01:31:15.669 --> 01:31:15.679 align:start position:0%
get rid of this and then you know they
 
01:31:17.110 --> 01:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
have time they have months to think
 
01:31:19.750 --> 01:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
about it come up with their process or
 
01:31:22.149 --> 01:31:22.159 align:start position:0%
when this goes to the senate beg for an
 
01:31:24.550 --> 01:31:24.560 align:start position:0%
amendment um and and then make their
 
01:31:26.629 --> 01:31:26.639 align:start position:0%
case but either way it'll force them to
 
01:31:27.830 --> 01:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
do the work
 
01:31:29.430 --> 01:31:29.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying that they're
 
01:31:31.270 --> 01:31:31.280 align:start position:0%
lazy and ignoring it but if i'm
 
01:31:33.350 --> 01:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
prioritizing my work and
 
01:31:36.390 --> 01:31:36.400 align:start position:0%
this might not matter if i was in charge
 
01:31:38.709 --> 01:31:38.719 align:start position:0%
but if you repeal it well now it becomes
 
01:31:40.790 --> 01:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
my priority so i'd like to see it all
 
01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:43.510 align:start position:0%
my priority so i'd like to see it all
stricken

01:31:43.510 --> 01:31:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:45.510 --> 01:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
all right well um
 
01:31:47.990 --> 01:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
chairman representative mcdonald
 
01:31:49.510 --> 01:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
i'm just curious if i could ask my
 
01:31:51.030 --> 01:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
democratic colleagues how you choose
 
01:31:55.030 --> 01:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:58.709 --> 01:31:58.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:00.149 --> 01:32:00.159 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i didn't understand the
 
01:32:00.159 --> 01:32:01.270 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i didn't understand the
question

01:32:01.270 --> 01:32:01.280 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:32:02.790 --> 01:32:02.800 align:start position:0%
or we're discussing how to choose state
 
01:32:04.070 --> 01:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
convention delegates we're just
 
01:32:05.510 --> 01:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
wondering how the democrats do it where
 
01:32:08.550 --> 01:32:08.560 align:start position:0%
you don't elect them on the ballot
 
01:32:10.390 --> 01:32:10.400 align:start position:0%
but that that's outside of the purview
 
01:32:12.629 --> 01:32:12.639 align:start position:0%
of this committee i mean i could i could
 
01:32:15.430 --> 01:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
i could look it up and find out but it's
 
01:32:17.030 --> 01:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
outside of the purview of the committee
 
01:32:18.229 --> 01:32:18.239 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
01:32:19.830 --> 01:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
yeah if you could let me know i'd
 
01:32:26.550 --> 01:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:29.830 --> 01:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
town and count our town and county
 
01:32:32.229 --> 01:32:32.239 align:start position:0%
democratic organizations in order to
 
01:32:35.350 --> 01:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
make sure as many that there are as many
 
01:32:38.629 --> 01:32:38.639 align:start position:0%
representatives as possible
 
01:32:40.790 --> 01:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
throughout the whole state but we do it
 
01:32:44.310 --> 01:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
recognizing that it is not part of
 
01:32:46.550 --> 01:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
the governmental structure so is it like
 
01:32:48.310 --> 01:32:48.320 align:start position:0%
a caucus system
 
01:33:04.229 --> 01:33:04.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:08.149 --> 01:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
there is a list of
 
01:33:08.159 --> 01:33:09.030 align:start position:0%
there is a list of
uh

01:33:09.030 --> 01:33:09.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:33:09.040 --> 01:33:09.830 align:start position:0%
uh
both

01:33:09.830 --> 01:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
both
 
01:33:12.390 --> 01:33:12.400 align:start position:0%
on the town county and and
 
01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:13.590 align:start position:0%
on the town county and and
elected

01:33:13.590 --> 01:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
elected
 
01:33:15.430 --> 01:33:15.440 align:start position:0%
representatives level a list of the
 
01:33:17.750 --> 01:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
people who are qualified and then i
 
01:33:20.070 --> 01:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
believe that there are also there are
 
01:33:21.189 --> 01:33:21.199 align:start position:0%
also local
 
01:33:23.270 --> 01:33:23.280 align:start position:0%
local elections so there are some people
 
01:33:25.910 --> 01:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
who are there by virtue of their
 
01:33:25.920 --> 01:33:27.030 align:start position:0%
who are there by virtue of their
position

01:33:27.030 --> 01:33:27.040 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:33:28.790 --> 01:33:28.800 align:start position:0%
and there are other people who are
 
01:33:31.590 --> 01:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
elected by the county caucuses
 
01:33:32.950 --> 01:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
okay all right
 
01:33:35.110 --> 01:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
the bill clearly says each state party
 
01:33:37.110 --> 01:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
convention so i'll presume that
 
01:33:38.950 --> 01:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
nobody knows if or when both parties
 
01:33:40.550 --> 01:33:40.560 align:start position:0%
ever use this but
 
01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:41.350 align:start position:0%
ever use this but
um

01:33:41.350 --> 01:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:43.110 --> 01:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
representative barry do i understand
 
01:33:45.030 --> 01:33:45.040 align:start position:0%
then that you might be requesting ols to
 
01:33:47.830 --> 01:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
do an amendment to hb 55 yes madam
 
01:33:49.189 --> 01:33:49.199 align:start position:0%
chairman i'm happy to lead the charge on
 
01:33:50.950 --> 01:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
that and and representative smith might
 
01:33:53.030 --> 01:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
do do a dueling amendment if indeed he
 
01:33:54.790 --> 01:33:54.800 align:start position:0%
wants to wipe the whole thing out and
 
01:33:57.189 --> 01:33:57.199 align:start position:0%
then we can have a little focus over
 
01:33:57.199 --> 01:33:58.070 align:start position:0%
then we can have a little focus over
that

01:33:58.070 --> 01:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:33:59.350 --> 01:33:59.360 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:33:59.360 --> 01:34:00.629 align:start position:0%
all right
okay

01:34:00.629 --> 01:34:00.639 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:34:02.310 --> 01:34:02.320 align:start position:0%
all right maybe we should send save that
 
01:34:06.790 --> 01:34:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:08.470 --> 01:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
01:34:10.470 --> 01:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
i think we've made a couple of decisions
 
01:34:12.950 --> 01:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
as a consensus by consensus on this
 
01:34:12.960 --> 01:34:14.310 align:start position:0%
as a consensus by consensus on this
committee

01:34:14.310 --> 01:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:34:16.229 --> 01:34:16.239 align:start position:0%

01:35:32.790 --> 01:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
getting it together because i
 
01:35:35.430 --> 01:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
i suspect we might need somebody on
 
01:35:37.030 --> 01:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
staff to
 
01:35:38.870 --> 01:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
to respond to your issues when you try
 
01:35:41.590 --> 01:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
to submit something and it doesn't work
 
01:35:44.870 --> 01:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
i'm just anticipating technology issues
 
01:35:47.030 --> 01:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
madam chair the simplest thing would be
 
01:35:49.750 --> 01:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
to get at least one member of staff
 
01:35:52.550 --> 01:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
equipped with these programs and and
 
01:35:53.830 --> 01:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
make sure they know how to print
 
01:35:56.470 --> 01:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
appropriately okay because the files
 
01:35:59.430 --> 01:35:59.440 align:start position:0%
the program files are fairly small and
 
01:36:01.189 --> 01:36:01.199 align:start position:0%
easy to email in
 
01:36:03.030 --> 01:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
it's making them
 
01:36:04.870 --> 01:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
readable by people without the program
 
01:36:06.470 --> 01:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
that's the challenge
 
01:36:07.750 --> 01:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:36:09.189 --> 01:36:09.199 align:start position:0%
so that will be
 
01:36:11.990 --> 01:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
to staff so that it can get to us 24
 
01:36:14.790 --> 01:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
hours before the meeting and i will not
 
01:36:17.830 --> 01:36:17.840 align:start position:0%
be haggling over an hour or so so if
 
01:36:20.950 --> 01:36:20.960 align:start position:0%
you're getting maps at 11 instead of 10
 
01:36:22.709 --> 01:36:22.719 align:start position:0%
we're gonna have to deal with it staff
 
01:36:24.709 --> 01:36:24.719 align:start position:0%
is doing the best they can to help
 
01:36:26.470 --> 01:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
accommodate us
 
01:36:29.109 --> 01:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
as to the bills themselves i'm expecting
 
01:36:31.350 --> 01:36:31.360 align:start position:0%
an amendment from representative barry
 
01:36:34.709 --> 01:36:34.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:37.109 --> 01:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
i am not expecting to be receiving maps
 
01:36:40.149 --> 01:36:40.159 align:start position:0%
on hb 51 or 53
 
01:36:42.470 --> 01:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
because i'm expecting that the senate
 
01:36:45.030 --> 01:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
will be dealing with those primarily and
 
01:36:46.790 --> 01:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
hope that they confirm that when they
 
01:36:48.950 --> 01:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
have their organization meeting
 
01:36:50.790 --> 01:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
so that it decreases the work for this
 
01:36:52.629 --> 01:36:52.639 align:start position:0%
committee though we will be reviewing it
 
01:36:56.310 --> 01:36:56.320 align:start position:0%
as it crosses over out of the senate to
 
01:36:56.320 --> 01:36:58.070 align:start position:0%
as it crosses over out of the senate to
us

01:36:58.070 --> 01:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:37:01.109 --> 01:37:01.119 align:start position:0%
and as to maps being submitted for
 
01:37:02.709 --> 01:37:02.719 align:start position:0%
consideration by the committee we will
 
01:37:06.790 --> 01:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
be dealing with hb 50 state rep hb 52
 
01:37:10.390 --> 01:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
congressional districts and hb 54 county
 
01:37:12.470 --> 01:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner and i will ask one more
 
01:37:15.270 --> 01:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
time is the hb link
 
01:37:22.629 --> 01:37:22.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:25.030 --> 01:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
because otherwise i have multiple stops
 
01:37:28.790 --> 01:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:29.910 align:start position:0%
 
oh

01:37:29.910 --> 01:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:37:32.229 --> 01:37:32.239 align:start position:0%
thank you i regret but thank you for
 
01:37:34.149 --> 01:37:34.159 align:start position:0%
that update
 
01:37:35.910 --> 01:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
all right does anybody else have any
 
01:37:38.149 --> 01:37:38.159 align:start position:0%
business for this meeting
 
01:37:40.149 --> 01:37:40.159 align:start position:0%
before we close it
 
01:37:42.790 --> 01:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
if you don't representative wilhelm
 
01:37:44.629 --> 01:37:44.639 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i was really
 
01:37:46.870 --> 01:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
pleased to hear that uh there would be
 
01:37:48.790 --> 01:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
two opportunities for the public to
 
01:37:51.910 --> 01:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
weigh in on the maps
 
01:37:53.990 --> 01:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
i'm hoping that as you do your
 
01:37:56.229 --> 01:37:56.239 align:start position:0%
scheduling you will consider
 
01:37:59.030 --> 01:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
having one of those held off-site and
 
01:38:00.830 --> 01:38:00.840 align:start position:0%
not in
 
01:38:03.669 --> 01:38:03.679 align:start position:0%
concord one of them in the evening so
 
01:38:03.679 --> 01:38:04.709 align:start position:0%
concord one of them in the evening so
that

01:38:04.709 --> 01:38:04.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:38:06.709 --> 01:38:06.719 align:start position:0%
folks who may be working during the day
 
01:38:09.030 --> 01:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
or might be further away i think the the
 
01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:10.070 align:start position:0%
or might be further away i think the the
county

01:38:10.070 --> 01:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
county
 
01:38:12.629 --> 01:38:12.639 align:start position:0%

01:38:14.470 --> 01:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
public listening sessions
 
01:38:16.470 --> 01:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
uh were helpful to get lots of input
 
01:38:18.390 --> 01:38:18.400 align:start position:0%
from lots of different types of people
 
01:38:20.470 --> 01:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
um who may not be able to travel to
 
01:38:22.550 --> 01:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
concord during the daytime
 
01:38:24.390 --> 01:38:24.400 align:start position:0%

01:38:27.830 --> 01:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
again remind the public who might be
 
01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:29.270 align:start position:0%
again remind the public who might be
listening

01:38:29.270 --> 01:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
listening
 
01:38:30.390 --> 01:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
01:38:33.430 --> 01:38:33.440 align:start position:0%
a website for you to submit testimony to
 
01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:34.149 align:start position:0%
a website for you to submit testimony to
and

01:38:34.149 --> 01:38:34.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:38:35.910 --> 01:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
the goal is to have what we will be
 
01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:37.510 align:start position:0%
the goal is to have what we will be
presenting

01:38:37.510 --> 01:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
presenting
 
01:38:40.310 --> 01:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
on that website before the hearing to
 
01:38:42.709 --> 01:38:42.719 align:start position:0%
provide access
 
01:38:45.189 --> 01:38:45.199 align:start position:0%
and um i'll have to sort of see what
 
01:38:47.510 --> 01:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
requests are going on because as far as
 
01:38:49.590 --> 01:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
i know that sort of brings true for any
 
01:38:51.669 --> 01:38:51.679 align:start position:0%
bill that the house
 
01:38:53.590 --> 01:38:53.600 align:start position:0%
considers and i think at a certain point
 
01:38:55.750 --> 01:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
we have to realize there are limits to
 
01:38:59.030 --> 01:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
what we do i also have concerns quite
 
01:39:01.270 --> 01:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
frankly about holding night meetings and
 
01:39:03.430 --> 01:39:03.440 align:start position:0%
the safety aspect of that for people
 
01:39:05.990 --> 01:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
coming in and out it was a consideration
 
01:39:07.830 --> 01:39:07.840 align:start position:0%
i can tell you when we scheduled public
 
01:39:10.709 --> 01:39:10.719 align:start position:0%
input sessions as to the location as to
 
01:39:13.830 --> 01:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
the availability of parking and access
 
01:39:16.709 --> 01:39:16.719 align:start position:0%
and i think those are exasperated at
 
01:39:19.189 --> 01:39:19.199 align:start position:0%
night here in concord or
 
01:39:20.550 --> 01:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
any place
 
01:39:23.669 --> 01:39:23.679 align:start position:0%
but we'll i'll take a look at it
 
01:39:24.790 --> 01:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:39:26.310 --> 01:39:26.320 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any other hands i want to
 
01:39:27.990 --> 01:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
