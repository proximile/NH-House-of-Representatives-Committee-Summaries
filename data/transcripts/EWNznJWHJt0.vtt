uh and on
 
00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
uh the representative luna was in the
 
00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
house i just started talking dave and uh
 
00:14:25.189 --> 00:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
i didn't realize that speaking of
 
00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
recording policies that apparently this
 
00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
is going to be recorded on youtube is is
 
00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
i want to make sure i speak
 
00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
so to set this up again as i just
 
00:14:46.629 --> 00:14:46.639 align:start position:0%
started to do hb 1295
 
00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
we were all here for the uh it was i was
 
00:14:50.949 --> 00:14:50.959 align:start position:0%
a prime sponsor so
 
00:14:53.509 --> 00:14:53.519 align:start position:0%
you may recall i introduced the bill
 
00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
months ago
 
00:14:58.710 --> 00:14:58.720 align:start position:0%
and explained the intent behind the bill
 
00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
uh months ago we had a lot of questions
 
00:15:04.389 --> 00:15:04.399 align:start position:0%
the day that we uh or that i introduced
 
00:15:04.399 --> 00:15:05.110 align:start position:0%
the day that we uh or that i introduced
it

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
and we spoke about it not that much an
 
00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
executive session and and
 
00:15:12.629 --> 00:15:12.639 align:start position:0%
it fairly quickly was recommended to
 
00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:15.110 align:start position:0%
interim study
so

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
as i'm setting this up let me just
 
00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
compare this as i did when i introduced
 
00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:21.680 align:start position:0%
the bill the first time to um
 
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
the gifted student bill it's it's the
 
00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:24.629 align:start position:0%
the gifted student bill it's it's the
same

00:15:24.629 --> 00:15:24.639 align:start position:0%
same
 
00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
concept true truly uh this bill has no
 
00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
policy this bill has no policy mandate
 
00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
uh and no spending requirement
 
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
um and does everybody have a copy i have
 
00:15:38.629 --> 00:15:38.639 align:start position:0%
one extra if you don't or you can
 
00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:40.480 align:start position:0%
certainly pull it up
 
00:15:41.749 --> 00:15:41.759 align:start position:0%
if you don't have you can put it up
 
00:15:41.759 --> 00:15:43.749 align:start position:0%
if you don't have you can put it up
online

00:15:43.749 --> 00:15:43.759 align:start position:0%
online
 
00:15:45.749 --> 00:15:45.759 align:start position:0%
very very short
 
00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
and again to
 
00:15:50.949 --> 00:15:50.959 align:start position:0%
set this up a little bit it's uh
 
00:15:53.269 --> 00:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
kind of modeled on the gifted student
 
00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
bill which similarly had as i said no
 
00:16:00.389 --> 00:16:00.399 align:start position:0%
policy mandate no spending requirement
 
00:16:03.749 --> 00:16:03.759 align:start position:0%
and all that did and all this does is
 
00:16:05.829 --> 00:16:05.839 align:start position:0%
ask the districts the new hampshire
 
00:16:07.269 --> 00:16:07.279 align:start position:0%
school districts
 
00:16:07.279 --> 00:16:08.470 align:start position:0%
school districts
to

00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:16:10.949 --> 00:16:10.959 align:start position:0%
share with doe
 
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:12.720 align:start position:0%
much in the same fashion as the gifted
 
00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:13.990 align:start position:0%
much in the same fashion as the gifted
bill

00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:14.000 align:start position:0%

bill 321 which is no statute has been
 
00:17:20.549 --> 00:17:20.559 align:start position:0%
sent out to all the schools in um
 
00:17:21.909 --> 00:17:21.919 align:start position:0%
hobbs and send me the link to i looked
 
00:17:23.669 --> 00:17:23.679 align:start position:0%
at is very at least for me hopefully for
 
00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:26.240 align:start position:0%
all of us it's very exciting to see
 
00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:27.429 align:start position:0%
all of us it's very exciting to see
that

00:17:27.429 --> 00:17:27.439 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
uh in response to the statute
 
00:17:33.029 --> 00:17:33.039 align:start position:0%
simply asking districts to uh share what
 
00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
if anything they're doing for for gifted
 
00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:35.990 align:start position:0%
if anything they're doing for for gifted
students

00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh with with doe for the so-called best
 
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
practices folder we spent a lot of now
 
00:17:42.549 --> 00:17:42.559 align:start position:0%
the reason they mentioned the gifted
 
00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:44.720 align:start position:0%
bill is because that
 
00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
two terms ago when it first was
 
00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
introduced it was my bill originally two
 
00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
terms ago uh that bill was sent to
 
00:17:53.669 --> 00:17:53.679 align:start position:0%
interim study and there were seven of us
 
00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:56.240 align:start position:0%
who met and talked and linked about it
 
00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:58.830 align:start position:0%
who met and talked and linked about it
um

00:17:58.830 --> 00:17:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:02.240 align:start position:0%
uh and trying to think barbra shaw
 
00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:03.350 align:start position:0%
uh and trying to think barbra shaw
was

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:18:04.789 --> 00:18:04.799 align:start position:0%
i think she chaired the committee
 
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
actually she did she chaired the uh
 
00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
the work session interim study committee
 
00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
on gifted students
 
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:15.200 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee after talking about it
 
00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:18.320 align:start position:0%
dan wolf was on that
 
00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:20.320 align:start position:0%
dave doherty was on there trying to
 
00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:22.480 align:start position:0%
think who else was anyway
 
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
the committee voted
 
00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
recommended five to two
 
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
on the gifted bill to
 
00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
have that move forward
 
00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:34.240 align:start position:0%
with recommendation and ultimately otp
 
00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:35.270 align:start position:0%
with recommendation and ultimately otp
um

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
and so in the fall
 
00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:37.909 align:start position:0%
and so in the fall
and

00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:37.919 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:18:37.919 --> 00:18:38.950 align:start position:0%
and
uh

00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
patty and lynn the representative
 
00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
it came to the full community of the
 
00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:46.230 align:start position:0%
it came to the full community of the
fall

00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:46.240 align:start position:0%
fall
 
00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
not for anything other than to have the
 
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
committee review the subcommittee's
 
00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.390 align:start position:0%
committee review the subcommittee's
recommendation

00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
and uh i recall representative shaw made
 
00:18:57.990 --> 00:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
the motion to support otp for that
 
00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
representative guile uh seconded it
 
00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:03.440 align:start position:0%
and uh i have to smile because uh
 
00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
robertson milo was there and he looked
 
00:19:07.669 --> 00:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
at me at the time i don't think mel
 
00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
was necessarily for it but after barbara
 
00:19:12.789 --> 00:19:12.799 align:start position:0%
and then mary moved it he
 
00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
he at that time voted to support
 
00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
otp on the gifted bill
 
00:19:21.029 --> 00:19:21.039 align:start position:0%
but that was just a recommendation in
 
00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:22.720 align:start position:0%
the fall of 2018 and then there was
 
00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
another election and i i wasn't here
 
00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:26.150 align:start position:0%
another election and i i wasn't here
representative

00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
lang tried to keep that going didn't
 
00:19:29.909 --> 00:19:29.919 align:start position:0%
move forward the next session
 
00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
but we brought it back this past session
 
00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
um and because of the time that we spent
 
00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
on it and having the the precedent of
 
00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
the impermitor from interim study for
 
00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
that bill it uh
 
00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
passed committee passed the house passed
 
00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
senate became law and it's uh i think
 
00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
and i hope that that bill
 
00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
is really making a difference every
 
00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
district in the state now is is at least
 
00:19:57.909 --> 00:19:57.919 align:start position:0%
thinking about um better identifying and
 
00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
supporting gifted students so this is
 
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
the same type of concept 1295 just
 
00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
asking schools
 
00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
to look at their policy reports now
 
00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:09.200 align:start position:0%
again i'm doing more talking i plan but
 
00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:12.320 align:start position:0%
i do want to set this up prop properly
 
00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
and thoroughly
 
00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
so this bill 1295
 
00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
asking for reports and what prompted
 
00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:21.200 align:start position:0%
this uh
 
00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
the covid thing the covet situation
 
00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
really had a lot to do with us because
 
00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
as you all know
 
00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:31.360 align:start position:0%
during the covet pandemic situation
 
00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
every school had to
 
00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
come up with a plan to go remote
 
00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:38.240 align:start position:0%
and these remote plans
 
00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
in many cases most cases involved
 
00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
media obviously
 
00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
you know classroom recordings uh
 
00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
hybrid policies
 
00:20:54.549 --> 00:20:54.559 align:start position:0%
youtube's uh you know zoom conferences
 
00:20:54.559 --> 00:20:55.510 align:start position:0%
youtube's uh you know zoom conferences
whatever

00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:56.310 align:start position:0%
whatever
so

00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:20:58.710 --> 00:20:58.720 align:start position:0%
very much uncharted waters and some of
 
00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:01.360 align:start position:0%
the concerns that came up out of these
 
00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
remote classes uh understandably had to
 
00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
do with you know privacy issues for
 
00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
teachers and students and participants
 
00:21:11.029 --> 00:21:11.039 align:start position:0%
for example and again i'm repeating
 
00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
stuff that
 
00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
we talked about in the hearing and exec
 
00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:15.430 align:start position:0%
we talked about in the hearing and exec
session

00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
but many folks obviously including
 
00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
myself because they put the bill in
 
00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:20.149 align:start position:0%
myself because they put the bill in
originally

00:21:20.149 --> 00:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
originally
 
00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh what about
 
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.350 align:start position:0%
uh what about
these

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:21:26.789 --> 00:21:26.799 align:start position:0%
these uh zoo zoom classes that are
 
00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
people can sign in on presumably with
 
00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
some with a password or whatever
 
00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
but what if somebody records a classroom
 
00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
zoom session what is what are the
 
00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
implications of that for
 
00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
all concern for the students
 
00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
if a student is participating remotely
 
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
in a zoom conference or a call or course
 
00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
and speaks up or whatever or the teacher
 
00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
speaks up now on one hand
 
00:21:56.549 --> 00:21:56.559 align:start position:0%
there's some good things about that
 
00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
because if you record it and you miss
 
00:22:01.029 --> 00:22:01.039 align:start position:0%
the zoom class then you can play it back
 
00:22:02.549 --> 00:22:02.559 align:start position:0%
and catch up and i think there's some
 
00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
real merit to that and good things about
 
00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:07.190 align:start position:0%
real merit to that and good things about
that

00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:09.909 --> 00:22:09.919 align:start position:0%
to tie that into here
 
00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
if this is being recorded i guess it is
 
00:22:14.549 --> 00:22:14.559 align:start position:0%
from what jennifer said
 
00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:16.640 align:start position:0%
uh then this will be out there i guess
 
00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:17.830 align:start position:0%
uh then this will be out there i guess
forever

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
forever
 
00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
i guess on youtube or until
 
00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
youtube goes away whatever
 
00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
so the
 
00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
the good part of that is that people can
 
00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
go back and listen to these house
 
00:22:31.669 --> 00:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
sessions house hearings or classes
 
00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:33.440 align:start position:0%
but the concern is
 
00:22:36.149 --> 00:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
uh what if a student a young person a
 
00:22:36.159 --> 00:22:37.830 align:start position:0%
uh what if a student a young person a
minor

00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
minor
 
00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
gives expression to something that they
 
00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
wish they could take back well they
 
00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:44.320 align:start position:0%
can't uh you know what we say and have
 
00:22:46.549 --> 00:22:46.559 align:start position:0%
said on all these countless house
 
00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
hearings and house sessions is out there
 
00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
for good
 
00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:51.830 align:start position:0%
for good
so

00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:52.630 align:start position:0%
so
uh

00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:52.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
our students and teachers
 
00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:57.200 align:start position:0%
that are doing remote classes hybrid
 
00:22:59.110 --> 00:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
classes zoom classes
 
00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
do they fully understand uh the
 
00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
implications of participating in a in a
 
00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
remote class
 
00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:07.029 align:start position:0%
remote class
uh

00:23:07.029 --> 00:23:07.039 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:23:09.029 --> 00:23:09.039 align:start position:0%
so anyway uh
 
00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
presumably every school district every
 
00:23:13.669 --> 00:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
school every teacher every class that
 
00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
does remote
 
00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
learning has a policy uh or not what if
 
00:23:20.549 --> 00:23:20.559 align:start position:0%
they don't or what if there
 
00:23:22.789 --> 00:23:22.799 align:start position:0%
is something wrong with the policy
 
00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
so as with the gifted bill to have a
 
00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
requirement a statutory requirement for
 
00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
districts to share
 
00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
uh with doe
 
00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
what they what their policy is for
 
00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
remote learning for for classes also
 
00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
what if a parent want wanted to or did
 
00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
in some cases
 
00:23:45.909 --> 00:23:45.919 align:start position:0%
you know if there's quarantine
 
00:23:45.919 --> 00:23:47.350 align:start position:0%
you know if there's quarantine
situations

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
situations
 
00:23:49.669 --> 00:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
if a parent wanted to come to a to
 
00:23:49.679 --> 00:23:50.630 align:start position:0%
if a parent wanted to come to a to
school

00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:23:51.909 --> 00:23:51.919 align:start position:0%
to pick up
 
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
uh hard copies or materials for their
 
00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:56.630 align:start position:0%
uh hard copies or materials for their
student

00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
student
 
00:23:58.149 --> 00:23:58.159 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
are there policies allowing for parents
 
00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:02.310 align:start position:0%
are there policies allowing for parents
to

00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:03.110 align:start position:0%
to
to

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
go to the school to pick up materials i
 
00:24:06.149 --> 00:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
it seems reasonable
 
00:24:09.029 --> 00:24:09.039 align:start position:0%
but we
 
00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:11.200 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic we hear
 
00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
questions about parents or students or
 
00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
you know when the school shut their
 
00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:17.190 align:start position:0%
you know when the school shut their
doors

00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
doors
 
00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:18.710 align:start position:0%
doors
uh

00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:24:21.669 --> 00:24:21.679 align:start position:0%
can can things be mailed uh again i i'm
 
00:24:24.149 --> 00:24:24.159 align:start position:0%
not pushing any policy we're not pushing
 
00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
any policy but we do want to
 
00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:28.070 align:start position:0%
any policy but we do want to
uh

00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
through these reports that would come in
 
00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
if this ever moves forward
 
00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
identify some of the
 
00:24:37.269 --> 00:24:37.279 align:start position:0%
bad practices to avoid and good
 
00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
practices to emulate so that's the
 
00:24:42.149 --> 00:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
intent behind this
 
00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:44.480 align:start position:0%
so that's a lot of background for this
 
00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
so having said all that
 
00:24:48.789 --> 00:24:48.799 align:start position:0%
uh this being a work session
 
00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:50.320 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
00:24:53.029 --> 00:24:53.039 align:start position:0%
1295 requiring school districts to
 
00:24:55.669 --> 00:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
report in classroom observer policies
 
00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
and in classrooms
 
00:24:59.510 --> 00:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
video streaming and recording policies
 
00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
to the department of education and also
 
00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
along these lines uh again before
 
00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:05.909 align:start position:0%
along these lines uh again before
let's

00:25:05.909 --> 00:25:05.919 align:start position:0%
let's
 
00:25:07.669 --> 00:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
we have other folks weigh in
 
00:25:09.029 --> 00:25:09.039 align:start position:0%
these things are ubiquitous they're
 
00:25:11.269 --> 00:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
everywhere uh you know i was a college
 
00:25:13.909 --> 00:25:13.919 align:start position:0%
professor for many many years and on the
 
00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
college level
 
00:25:17.669 --> 00:25:17.679 align:start position:0%
uh and then oliver was too and most of
 
00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
you have all been in classrooms
 
00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:22.240 align:start position:0%
where what is the professor or the
 
00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
teacher's policy with regard to in
 
00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
classroom recording i know
 
00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
some i can think of a amp anatomy and
 
00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
physiology class
 
00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
where um it was encouraged for students
 
00:25:36.789 --> 00:25:36.799 align:start position:0%
if they wanted to record everything so
 
00:25:38.549 --> 00:25:38.559 align:start position:0%
that they would have that those lectures
 
00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
to review and study
 
00:25:44.149 --> 00:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
but the implications of the college you
 
00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:46.400 align:start position:0%
know college syllabuses professors have
 
00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
their recording policies it's it's a
 
00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:49.669 align:start position:0%
their recording policies it's it's a
public

00:25:49.669 --> 00:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
contract of sorts of syllabus you know
 
00:25:53.029 --> 00:25:53.039 align:start position:0%
here's the policy if you're going to
 
00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
take this class understand if you're
 
00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:56.320 align:start position:0%
going to record these are the
 
00:25:59.110 --> 00:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
constraints and recording the lectures
 
00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
now for high schools again
 
00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:03.200 align:start position:0%
we're hearing there's a myriad or
 
00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
spectrum of
 
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
policies in terms of
 
00:26:09.269 --> 00:26:09.279 align:start position:0%
uh recording
 
00:26:09.279 --> 00:26:10.789 align:start position:0%
uh recording
um

00:26:10.789 --> 00:26:10.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:10.799 --> 00:26:12.149 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:26:12.149 --> 00:26:12.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
when i was in the classroom
 
00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
uh the high school classroom these
 
00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
things didn't exist in the college
 
00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
classroom they
 
00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
not that long ago everybody had these
 
00:26:22.549 --> 00:26:22.559 align:start position:0%
things and i would just say okay
 
00:26:23.669 --> 00:26:23.679 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
if you want to record
 
00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
for my purposes if you want to record
 
00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
anything class i have no problem with it
 
00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
but i don't want you to be distracted or
 
00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:32.240 align:start position:0%
playing with your cell phones if you're
 
00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:35.120 align:start position:0%
going to record fine if not i don't want
 
00:26:37.269 --> 00:26:37.279 align:start position:0%
you doing you know
 
00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:39.440 align:start position:0%
word blitz while i'm while we're having
 
00:26:41.029 --> 00:26:41.039 align:start position:0%
a class
 
00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
so that's another piece of this is
 
00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
in class uh
 
00:26:49.029 --> 00:26:49.039 align:start position:0%
policies for or policies for in class
 
00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
recording there's a lot of stuff here
 
00:26:57.510 --> 00:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
considered and evaluated
 
00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:01.350 align:start position:0%
considered and evaluated
and

00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
again as with the gifted bill to have
 
00:27:04.789 --> 00:27:04.799 align:start position:0%
something with doe with best practices
 
00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:06.400 align:start position:0%
worst practices i think is really
 
00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
important really needed so there's some
 
00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:11.360 align:start position:0%
background and uh who else has
 
00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:13.360 align:start position:0%
any thoughts on any of this that's why
 
00:27:16.149 --> 00:27:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
uh what's on cornell
 
00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
well for one thing i i don't think the
 
00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:22.480 align:start position:0%
the bill or the amendment had anything
 
00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
to do with parents going in to pick up
 
00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
any kind of
 
00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
school work which i think is
 
00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
always allowed and always has been that
 
00:27:31.029 --> 00:27:31.039 align:start position:0%
if they want to go
 
00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
which as long as they're given enough
 
00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:34.480 align:start position:0%
notice the work is always waiting in the
 
00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
office for parents to pick up and i
 
00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
don't think there's that anywhere but do
 
00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
you know how many districts do not have
 
00:27:43.909 --> 00:27:43.919 align:start position:0%
a comprehensive video
 
00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
recording because i looked up
 
00:27:47.909 --> 00:27:47.919 align:start position:0%
manchester's last night and every single
 
00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:50.480 align:start position:0%
one of their policies is listed on their
 
00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
web page
 
00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
and in the booklet that students are
 
00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
given the first day of school which
 
00:27:58.310 --> 00:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
parents have to sign and return that
 
00:28:01.269 --> 00:28:01.279 align:start position:0%
they received every single policy
 
00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
so i guess what i'm saying is i don't
 
00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
know how many don't
 
00:28:07.669 --> 00:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
have this um
 
00:28:07.679 --> 00:28:08.630 align:start position:0%
have this um
and

00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:28:10.549 --> 00:28:10.559 align:start position:0%
to be quite honest to me this is busy
 
00:28:12.789 --> 00:28:12.799 align:start position:0%
work it's busy work for the for the
 
00:28:15.269 --> 00:28:15.279 align:start position:0%
district to have to do it and i think
 
00:28:17.269 --> 00:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
it's busy work for the
 
00:28:19.269 --> 00:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
department of ed to have to keep track
 
00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:21.440 align:start position:0%
of them when if a district doesn't like
 
00:28:23.269 --> 00:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
theirs or they're looking for help they
 
00:28:24.549 --> 00:28:24.559 align:start position:0%
could just call the school board
 
00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
association or a neighboring sau and say
 
00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:29.440 align:start position:0%
hey what do you have is your policy or
 
00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
even look online because if anybody
 
00:28:33.909 --> 00:28:33.919 align:start position:0%
looks at manchester's you can find their
 
00:28:33.919 --> 00:28:35.029 align:start position:0%
looks at manchester's you can find their
entire

00:28:35.029 --> 00:28:35.039 align:start position:0%
entire
 
00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:37.360 align:start position:0%
policy list right there on the first
 
00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
page of their website
 
00:28:41.909 --> 00:28:41.919 align:start position:0%
sure great great thought great question
 
00:28:43.669 --> 00:28:43.679 align:start position:0%
your first question was do i know how
 
00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
many uh districts have policies in place
 
00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
and i don't
 
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
they're in good on you for taking the
 
00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
time to look at what manchester does i
 
00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
know other folks in the room uh may or
 
00:28:55.909 --> 00:28:55.919 align:start position:0%
may not have some uh
 
00:28:57.990 --> 00:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
knows of what their districts do in this
 
00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.029 align:start position:0%
knows of what their districts do in this
area

00:28:59.029 --> 00:28:59.039 align:start position:0%
area
 
00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
so uh just couple quick responses um
 
00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
that manchester has a
 
00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
uh it sounds like
 
00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
from you're looking at the website and
 
00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:10.880 align:start position:0%
looking into this they have a
 
00:29:13.269 --> 00:29:13.279 align:start position:0%
comprehensive uh policy
 
00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
governing this
 
00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
but my my question to you would be was
 
00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
this policy
 
00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
did it predate the recording policy or
 
00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
did it predate the covert thing or is
 
00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
this a policy that's been put into place
 
00:29:27.909 --> 00:29:27.919 align:start position:0%
since the covid
 
00:29:27.919 --> 00:29:30.470 align:start position:0%
since the covid
shutdowns

00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
shutdowns
 
00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
it it predates it but i i think it's
 
00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
comprehensive enough that it covered
 
00:29:37.909 --> 00:29:37.919 align:start position:0%
what happened during shutdown because it
 
00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
said if a teacher intends to create a
 
00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
recording of a class
 
00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
britain prior written consent must be
 
00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:46.480 align:start position:0%
obtained by the parent legal guardian or
 
00:29:48.389 --> 00:29:48.399 align:start position:0%
if a student parent administrator to
 
00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:50.240 align:start position:0%
remember which is to create a recording
 
00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
of a teacher student a class prior
 
00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:54.240 align:start position:0%
written consent must be obtained from
 
00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:56.480 align:start position:0%
the the teacher and the parent legal
 
00:29:59.430 --> 00:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
guardian of each affected school and
 
00:30:02.389 --> 00:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
and like i said these all go home the
 
00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
first day of school
 
00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
in the handbook that the students get
 
00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:07.510 align:start position:0%
in the handbook that the students get
and

00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
there's a page in it that must be signed
 
00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
by the parent and the student saying
 
00:30:12.789 --> 00:30:12.799 align:start position:0%
that they've written these and they
 
00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
agree to them
 
00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.269 align:start position:0%
agree to them
sure

00:30:15.269 --> 00:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:17.200 align:start position:0%
sure thank you so
 
00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
i'll get right to your representative um
 
00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
so my response and concern to this
 
00:30:26.149 --> 00:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
though uh representative cornell this
 
00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:28.640 align:start position:0%
predates uh kovit
 
00:30:30.789 --> 00:30:30.799 align:start position:0%
and the recording policies that
 
00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:33.200 align:start position:0%
manchester has in place uh sound
 
00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
wonderful for pre-covert but what you
 
00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:38.240 align:start position:0%
just described does not address hybrid
 
00:30:40.789 --> 00:30:40.799 align:start position:0%
classes or zoom classes and that's kind
 
00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
of part of what the impetus behind this
 
00:30:44.789 --> 00:30:44.799 align:start position:0%
bill was was this new
 
00:30:48.149 --> 00:30:48.159 align:start position:0%
world of remote zoom classes
 
00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
and so as i explained earlier when i
 
00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:50.950 align:start position:0%
and so as i explained earlier when i
spoke

00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
spoke
 
00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
probably for too long uh explaining the
 
00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
impetus behind this the the zoom
 
00:30:57.909 --> 00:30:57.919 align:start position:0%
aspect is not doesn't sound like that
 
00:30:59.909 --> 00:30:59.919 align:start position:0%
obviously that's the policy was put in
 
00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
place before covert so remote classes
 
00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:04.720 align:start position:0%
and zoom classes that's a whole
 
00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
issue that i try to
 
00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
describe that it sounds like manchester
 
00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
that's not has not addressed and perhaps
 
00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:13.360 align:start position:0%
needs to i'm not saying what their
 
00:31:15.909 --> 00:31:15.919 align:start position:0%
policy should be but it sounds like what
 
00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:18.640 align:start position:0%
you described does not address
 
00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:19.509 align:start position:0%
you described does not address
the

00:31:19.509 --> 00:31:19.519 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:31:22.789 --> 00:31:22.799 align:start position:0%
zoom youtube post covert hybrid remote
 
00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
learning issue that
 
00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
is of concern to some folks and my other
 
00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:29.200 align:start position:0%
point i did want to make in terms of you
 
00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:31.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned like busy work
 
00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
i know
 
00:31:34.389 --> 00:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
when the gifted bill went to the house
 
00:31:34.399 --> 00:31:35.269 align:start position:0%
when the gifted bill went to the house
floor

00:31:35.269 --> 00:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
floor
 
00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
leading up to that there were some folks
 
00:31:41.029 --> 00:31:41.039 align:start position:0%
who said it's an unfunded mandate or
 
00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
it's extra work or busy work or whatever
 
00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:47.440 align:start position:0%
and my response to that was uh
 
00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
the last thing that most of us want to
 
00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
do is is give extra busy work to to
 
00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:53.440 align:start position:0%
anyone anything is they have enough to
 
00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:54.470 align:start position:0%
anyone anything is they have enough to
do

00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
but if there's a policy in place whether
 
00:31:58.789 --> 00:31:58.799 align:start position:0%
it's for gifted or
 
00:31:58.799 --> 00:31:59.509 align:start position:0%
it's for gifted or
for

00:31:59.509 --> 00:31:59.519 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:31:59.519 --> 00:32:00.710 align:start position:0%
for
recording

00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
recording
 
00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:01.830 align:start position:0%
recording
uh

00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:32:04.149 --> 00:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
the requirement basically is some of
 
00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
this are it could be satisfied with just
 
00:32:09.269 --> 00:32:09.279 align:start position:0%
an email to the contacted doe with an
 
00:32:12.549 --> 00:32:12.559 align:start position:0%
attachment saying or from ancestor
 
00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
with regard to the requirement to submit
 
00:32:18.789 --> 00:32:18.799 align:start position:0%
a report on gifted or media policies uh
 
00:32:20.389 --> 00:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
here's an attachment to lincoln here's
 
00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:22.640 align:start position:0%
what we do so from what you said there's
 
00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
something in place already so
 
00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
to satisfy the requirement uh i don't
 
00:32:31.269 --> 00:32:31.279 align:start position:0%
see it as extra odious unfunded mandate
 
00:32:33.909 --> 00:32:33.919 align:start position:0%
at all uh administrative administrative
 
00:32:35.269 --> 00:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
assistant would just send an email an
 
00:32:37.269 --> 00:32:37.279 align:start position:0%
attachment to doe and then
 
00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
they would file it so anyway i just
 
00:32:42.389 --> 00:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
wanted to respond to that in that way um
 
00:32:42.399 --> 00:32:46.470 align:start position:0%
wanted to respond to that in that way um
represent

00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:49.029 --> 00:32:49.039 align:start position:0%
i was curious there was a mandate that
 
00:32:49.039 --> 00:32:50.070 align:start position:0%
i was curious there was a mandate that
um

00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
mandated districts to post policies all
 
00:32:54.389 --> 00:32:54.399 align:start position:0%
policies so there is not right i mean to
 
00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
post to post online there's no policy
 
00:32:59.430 --> 00:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
that says schools must do that is that
 
00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
correct yeah thank you yeah that's
 
00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
correct uh again as i've said a couple
 
00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:04.640 align:start position:0%
of times uh
 
00:33:07.269 --> 00:33:07.279 align:start position:0%
this the intent behind this very short
 
00:33:07.279 --> 00:33:08.149 align:start position:0%
this the intent behind this very short
bill

00:33:08.149 --> 00:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:10.640 align:start position:0%
uh was simply to create another best
 
00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:13.360 align:start position:0%
practices folder no policy mandate
 
00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
schools don't have to do anything policy
 
00:33:17.269 --> 00:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
wise other than just share what they
 
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
what they do that's right and secondly
 
00:33:21.029 --> 00:33:21.039 align:start position:0%
so you mentioned going back to the
 
00:33:24.389 --> 00:33:24.399 align:start position:0%
gifted um that it's making a difference
 
00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
and what
 
00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
measurement is being used to say it's
 
00:33:29.509 --> 00:33:29.519 align:start position:0%
making a difference the doe has this
 
00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
folder versus school districts hey we
 
00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
need a policy we do a search online you
 
00:33:35.509 --> 00:33:35.519 align:start position:0%
can find it just like that wherever you
 
00:33:37.269 --> 00:33:37.279 align:start position:0%
want you know let's say if you think you
 
00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
have a school similar to
 
00:33:41.029 --> 00:33:41.039 align:start position:0%
boaz is similar to bedford so they're
 
00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
going to go look at bedford they're
 
00:33:43.509 --> 00:33:43.519 align:start position:0%
going to go look at amherst so i'm just
 
00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:45.200 align:start position:0%
wondering what tool was used for you to
 
00:33:47.669 --> 00:33:47.679 align:start position:0%
say that that folder made the difference
 
00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
were there do we have do we have just
 
00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
follow up to that do we have numbers
 
00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
that show
 
00:33:55.269 --> 00:33:55.279 align:start position:0%
how much access this folder gets i mean
 
00:33:57.269 --> 00:33:57.279 align:start position:0%
that's an easy tool the doe that would
 
00:34:00.149 --> 00:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
be for the doe i guess the answer maybe
 
00:34:02.789 --> 00:34:02.799 align:start position:0%
um is it used
 
00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
sure yeah great great question
 
00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
of course this is really new and the
 
00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
reason i say that i and some of us are
 
00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
very excited about the fact that this is
 
00:34:12.869 --> 00:34:12.879 align:start position:0%
uh now in place
 
00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh qualitative you know i think you're
 
00:34:17.669 --> 00:34:17.679 align:start position:0%
looking for maybe a metric or
 
00:34:17.679 --> 00:34:18.950 align:start position:0%
looking for maybe a metric or
quantitative

00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
quantitative
 
00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
measure of how this gifted bill
 
00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
which was the model for this bill is
 
00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:27.200 align:start position:0%
making a difference and the intent of
 
00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
the gift of bill for at least from my
 
00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
perspective was to get
 
00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:32.240 align:start position:0%
districts to
 
00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
have a conversation and discussion
 
00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
locally on what they could are doing or
 
00:34:39.829 --> 00:34:39.839 align:start position:0%
could do to identify and support give to
 
00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
students so the fact that every district
 
00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
now has to look at what they're doing or
 
00:34:46.869 --> 00:34:46.879 align:start position:0%
not in many cases they're not doing
 
00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
anything so the fact that there's a
 
00:34:50.470 --> 00:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
conversation now that inevitably is
 
00:34:52.149 --> 00:34:52.159 align:start position:0%
going to happen in every district
 
00:34:52.159 --> 00:34:53.750 align:start position:0%
going to happen in every district
qualitatively

00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
qualitatively
 
00:34:56.869 --> 00:34:56.879 align:start position:0%
that's how some of us think it's already
 
00:34:58.390 --> 00:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
in the process of making a big
 
00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:00.390 align:start position:0%
in the process of making a big
difference

00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:00.400 align:start position:0%
difference
 
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
to your question if i think i'm here
 
00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
correctly you know how we
 
00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
how as i said i think it's making a
 
00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:11.440 align:start position:0%
difference how do i prove that um
 
00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
well my answer again is the fact that
 
00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
there's a discussion was the intended
 
00:35:17.829 --> 00:35:17.839 align:start position:0%
bill was to get people to pay attention
 
00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
and talk about gifted so does that kind
 
00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
of answer your question a little bit
 
00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:23.200 align:start position:0%
kind of i'm not sure
 
00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
you know that those discussions have
 
00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
happened i guess for me is
 
00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if
 
00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:29.030 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if
the

00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
because it's in a folder
 
00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
you think that that's going to
 
00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
generate all kinds of talk and whatever
 
00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
because it's in the doe folder i mean is
 
00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
that what we're saying
 
00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:35:47.109 --> 00:35:47.119 align:start position:0%
yeah sure um this is uh brand new uh in
 
00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
fact the the date that this go gifted
 
00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
goes it went into effect i'm trying to
 
00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
think what it was so there'll be a
 
00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
question we could answer much better in
 
00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
a year after
 
00:35:57.990 --> 00:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
there's been some time to see what's
 
00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
come into doe and again we have a rep
 
00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:02.240 align:start position:0%
from doe here
 
00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:03.190 align:start position:0%
from doe here
so

00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:03.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
in the short term
 
00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
i'm thrilled personally and others are
 
00:36:10.069 --> 00:36:10.079 align:start position:0%
as well that every as i said every
 
00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
district is now talking about something
 
00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:14.240 align:start position:0%
that we think needed to be talked about
 
00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:15.030 align:start position:0%
that we think needed to be talked about
that

00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:16.640 align:start position:0%
we think was not getting enough
 
00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:18.400 align:start position:0%
attention so the fact that it's
 
00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:19.270 align:start position:0%
attention so the fact that it's
being

00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:22.480 align:start position:0%
uh discussed i think is a huge win at
 
00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
the start now beyond that uh
 
00:36:27.829 --> 00:36:27.839 align:start position:0%
representative paul i think in a year
 
00:36:29.829 --> 00:36:29.839 align:start position:0%
we can
 
00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:33.280 align:start position:0%
get with doe and uh and see what's come
 
00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
in how many people have accessed the
 
00:36:39.349 --> 00:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
the folder on best practices for gifted
 
00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh how many really cool ideas that other
 
00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:43.910 align:start position:0%
uh how many really cool ideas that other
districts

00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
that the district put in that other
 
00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
districts have never thought of that
 
00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
they say wow you're doing this we're
 
00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
going to take and do a version of this
 
00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:51.589 align:start position:0%
going to take and do a version of this
too

00:36:51.589 --> 00:36:51.599 align:start position:0%
too
 
00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:54.720 align:start position:0%
that analysis and evaluation obviously
 
00:36:57.109 --> 00:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
can't take place until this has been in
 
00:36:59.829 --> 00:36:59.839 align:start position:0%
in place for you know a year
 
00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
and yeah i think i and hopefully all of
 
00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
us will be very interested
 
00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
to see uh how much um
 
00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:09.109 align:start position:0%
to see uh how much um
good

00:37:09.109 --> 00:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:11.680 align:start position:0%
flows from this but again that's we can
 
00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:14.320 align:start position:0%
answer that better in a year
 
00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:28.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative moffitt
 
00:37:30.310 --> 00:37:30.320 align:start position:0%
a couple things that i wanted to bring
 
00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
up um
 
00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:33.990 align:start position:0%
up um
regarding

00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
discussing um
 
00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
the policies that you were talking about
 
00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
i believe i don't know that schools are
 
00:37:42.310 --> 00:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
required to post them online just have
 
00:37:44.069 --> 00:37:44.079 align:start position:0%
the policies have to be available to the
 
00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
public so that maybe you show up at the
 
00:37:47.430 --> 00:37:47.440 align:start position:0%
school or the fau office they're
 
00:37:49.109 --> 00:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
available to the public
 
00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:52.079 align:start position:0%
that being said um the recording the opt
 
00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
out of the recording
 
00:37:56.069 --> 00:37:56.079 align:start position:0%
that does predate kovid
 
00:37:57.910 --> 00:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
i do remember when that came into play
 
00:37:59.510 --> 00:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
that we were all required to actually
 
00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
have public hearings
 
00:38:03.109 --> 00:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
to discuss right whether or not this
 
00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
would go into place
 
00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
so maybe you'll remember better actually
 
00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:10.640 align:start position:0%
my thought was at the time it kind of
 
00:38:13.349 --> 00:38:13.359 align:start position:0%
morphed into whether people wanted their
 
00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
children to be recorded and whether to
 
00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
be on the school webpage for example at
 
00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
this point social media i feel as though
 
00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
that's what it morphed into and that's
 
00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
what you opt out of i knew at the time
 
00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:24.720 align:start position:0%
of the hearing so i can remember our
 
00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
superintendent discussing with us it
 
00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
originated something along the lines of
 
00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
teachers that were going for advanced
 
00:38:33.349 --> 00:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
degrees and they were actually recording
 
00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
themselves teaching
 
00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
and they were using that to kind of look
 
00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:38.560 align:start position:0%
back and see how that they were doing
 
00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:40.640 align:start position:0%
sort of as a review
 
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
that being said too i just wanted to
 
00:38:44.069 --> 00:38:44.079 align:start position:0%
bring up something else i know we talk
 
00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
about the new hampshire school board
 
00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:46.710 align:start position:0%
about the new hampshire school board
association

00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:46.720 align:start position:0%
association
 
00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:48.880 align:start position:0%
quite often and they do provide a
 
00:38:51.109 --> 00:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
service for sure but they are our
 
00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
lobbying organization i just hope that
 
00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
we refer people always back to the doe
 
00:38:58.230 --> 00:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
because i think
 
00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
they're the experts in this area
 
00:39:03.109 --> 00:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
um and i'd like to dig deeper into the
 
00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:05.200 align:start position:0%
cameras as far as
 
00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:06.640 align:start position:0%
the scope of this is concerned i don't
 
00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
know if we're able to or not because i
 
00:39:10.069 --> 00:39:10.079 align:start position:0%
know it's not on the original bill but
 
00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
um but a couple of things that i wanted
 
00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
to talk about just where as far as
 
00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:16.240 align:start position:0%
safety and security are concerned
 
00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
we learned in texas that it probably
 
00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
would have been very helpful if there
 
00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:23.200 align:start position:0%
were video cameras in the classroom
 
00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
and one thing that i've tossed around in
 
00:39:27.589 --> 00:39:27.599 align:start position:0%
my head is you know what
 
00:39:29.829 --> 00:39:29.839 align:start position:0%
maybe we don't maybe we have those um
 
00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
the sound muted for example right but at
 
00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
least that way
 
00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
let's say there's a security officer in
 
00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
the school or the local police
 
00:39:40.069 --> 00:39:40.079 align:start position:0%
department at least they can see in
 
00:39:41.589 --> 00:39:41.599 align:start position:0%
i'm going to take that a step further
 
00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
and say that we would also need
 
00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
another layer of protection because as
 
00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
far as parkland is concerned their
 
00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
cameras were off i want to say 27
 
00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:52.240 align:start position:0%
minutes or something and that was one
 
00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
thing that got them into trouble in
 
00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
helping out the children the cameras are
 
00:39:57.109 --> 00:39:57.119 align:start position:0%
not in real time
 
00:39:58.950 --> 00:39:58.960 align:start position:0%
the other thing i'm wondering too
 
00:40:01.829 --> 00:40:01.839 align:start position:0%
is we're talking about recordings for
 
00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
when the teachers are doing a lesson
 
00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
it's very helpful for the children to
 
00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
have a recording later i i understand
 
00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
that especially with covid when people
 
00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
had to be out on a regular basis
 
00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if there was something
 
00:40:16.069 --> 00:40:16.079 align:start position:0%
where yes if it was recorded we can have
 
00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
the lesson recorded but if there's a way
 
00:40:20.309 --> 00:40:20.319 align:start position:0%
that we could mute out maybe after the
 
00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
fact before it shared
 
00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
what the students are saying because i
 
00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
do think the classroom needs to be a
 
00:40:28.309 --> 00:40:28.319 align:start position:0%
safe area for students you're right once
 
00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:30.640 align:start position:0%
it's documented it's forever i think
 
00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
there's too much of a kind of gotcha out
 
00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
there and these are just young kids
 
00:40:35.829 --> 00:40:35.839 align:start position:0%
trying to learn and i don't want to come
 
00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
up when they were 35
 
00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:38.800 align:start position:0%
that they asked the question that
 
00:40:40.309 --> 00:40:40.319 align:start position:0%
someone thought was ignorant or made a
 
00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
comment in it to follow them so thank
 
00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:46.230 align:start position:0%
comment in it to follow them so thank
you

00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
thank you representative blitzfield
 
00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
i appreciate those thoughts very much
 
00:40:53.829 --> 00:40:53.839 align:start position:0%
and you'll are on a school board correct
 
00:40:56.069 --> 00:40:56.079 align:start position:0%
website tanner
 
00:40:58.069 --> 00:40:58.079 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:40:59.589 --> 00:40:59.599 align:start position:0%
first of all i think
 
00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
the doe has made rules that zoom can't
 
00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:03.670 align:start position:0%
the doe has made rules that zoom can't
be

00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
done in schools anymore
 
00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:06.400 align:start position:0%
or not
 
00:41:08.309 --> 00:41:08.319 align:start position:0%
that they can't be done in schools but
 
00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:10.720 align:start position:0%
certainly they have a policy now that a
 
00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
school can't go to zoom
 
00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
uh for covet
 
00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:15.349 align:start position:0%
uh for covet
so

00:41:15.349 --> 00:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:16.960 align:start position:0%
i think um
 
00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
you know the video policies that schools
 
00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:21.190 align:start position:0%
you know the video policies that schools
make

00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:21.200 align:start position:0%
make
 
00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
they make they have made because they
 
00:41:25.829 --> 00:41:25.839 align:start position:0%
have video cameras security cameras on
 
00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
buses they have security cameras in
 
00:41:30.309 --> 00:41:30.319 align:start position:0%
classrooms and i think um you know
 
00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
kearsarge has their videos
 
00:41:35.829 --> 00:41:35.839 align:start position:0%
i also think that um
 
00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
you know there one of the reasons that
 
00:41:40.870 --> 00:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
this was kind of put on the back burner
 
00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
i think this bill
 
00:41:43.589 --> 00:41:43.599 align:start position:0%
was because
 
00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
once we opened the pandora's box
 
00:41:47.349 --> 00:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
of this
 
00:41:50.069 --> 00:41:50.079 align:start position:0%
whole issue it just went
 
00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
you know really far and i think that
 
00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:53.750 align:start position:0%
you know really far and i think that
um

00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:54.640 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
what about charter schools what about
 
00:41:58.470 --> 00:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
the apprentice schools and the chi
 
00:41:58.480 --> 00:41:59.589 align:start position:0%
the apprentice schools and the chi
schools

00:41:59.589 --> 00:41:59.599 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:02.720 align:start position:0%
that are internet schools um is there do
 
00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
they have a policy or or is there a
 
00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
policy for them
 
00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
um you know recording students and and
 
00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
their internet
 
00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
uh materials and their teachers um
 
00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:15.430 align:start position:0%
uh materials and their teachers um
and

00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:42:18.069 --> 00:42:18.079 align:start position:0%
do private schools and schools receiving
 
00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:20.720 align:start position:0%
voucher money are they going to be
 
00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:22.720 align:start position:0%
covered in in this particular thing
 
00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
because they're going to have a video
 
00:42:27.349 --> 00:42:27.359 align:start position:0%
as well um
 
00:42:28.829 --> 00:42:28.839 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
00:42:31.589 --> 00:42:31.599 align:start position:0%
um one of the comments that you made
 
00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:34.160 align:start position:0%
about uh in your opening
 
00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:35.349 align:start position:0%
about uh in your opening
statement

00:42:35.349 --> 00:42:35.359 align:start position:0%
statement
 
00:42:37.109 --> 00:42:37.119 align:start position:0%
was about how
 
00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
one of the things
 
00:42:40.870 --> 00:42:40.880 align:start position:0%
collecting this information is con to
 
00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
identify the good and the bad
 
00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
policies and
 
00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
i think it would be
 
00:42:50.309 --> 00:42:50.319 align:start position:0%
better in my mind
 
00:42:50.319 --> 00:42:51.589 align:start position:0%
better in my mind
if

00:42:51.589 --> 00:42:51.599 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:42:54.309 --> 00:42:54.319 align:start position:0%
the doe or and i'm sure the state school
 
00:42:57.430 --> 00:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
boards association has
 
00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
a best practices policy for video
 
00:43:03.190 --> 00:43:03.200 align:start position:0%
recordings in classrooms and that
 
00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
instead of collecting from the schools
 
00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:08.560 align:start position:0%
they actually
 
00:43:09.990 --> 00:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
give guidance
 
00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:10.829 align:start position:0%
give guidance
as

00:43:10.829 --> 00:43:10.839 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:43:13.349 --> 00:43:13.359 align:start position:0%
to what would be some of the best
 
00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
practices so um i think it you know it
 
00:43:19.510 --> 00:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
goes both ways and i guess my last thing
 
00:43:22.069 --> 00:43:22.079 align:start position:0%
is is time is money
 
00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
and um one of the things that
 
00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
eight years ago when i started um my
 
00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
truck here at
 
00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
the house
 
00:43:35.430 --> 00:43:35.440 align:start position:0%
i started because teaching
 
00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
i was just totally
 
00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:40.240 align:start position:0%
and and i didn't have some of the higher
 
00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
00:43:45.270 --> 00:43:45.280 align:start position:0%
over regulated teaching areas but
 
00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
teaching was just in schools public
 
00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:49.030 align:start position:0%
teaching was just in schools public
schools

00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:43:52.069 --> 00:43:52.079 align:start position:0%
it's one regulation one request
 
00:43:52.079 --> 00:43:52.829 align:start position:0%
it's one regulation one request
one

00:43:52.829 --> 00:43:52.839 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
requirement you know no big deal
 
00:43:57.990 --> 00:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
add them all up
 
00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
and somebody's got to do it and that
 
00:44:03.109 --> 00:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
somebody has has to do a lot of
 
00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:05.680 align:start position:0%
collection and this one is major because
 
00:44:08.309 --> 00:44:08.319 align:start position:0%
you're talking security cams you're
 
00:44:10.790 --> 00:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
talking cameras on buses you're talking
 
00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:11.750 align:start position:0%
talking cameras on buses you're talking
about

00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
cameras where teachers want um you know
 
00:44:15.910 --> 00:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
or student teaching and they they need
 
00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
to be videotaped you're talking about
 
00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
possible zoom classes and and at this
 
00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:22.720 align:start position:0%
point there's no way
 
00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
if it's on the internet just like you
 
00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
said with us it's no way to take it back
 
00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:28.240 align:start position:0%
you know so
 
00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
um and and we're not doing zoom classes
 
00:44:34.710 --> 00:44:34.720 align:start position:0%
in the future um at least not unless we
 
00:44:37.430 --> 00:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
want to extend the school year a lot
 
00:44:41.430 --> 00:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
and perhaps
 
00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:48.390 align:start position:0%
and perhaps
even

00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:48.400 align:start position:0%
even
 
00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:50.480 align:start position:0%
sent off in different bills unless
 
00:44:53.109 --> 00:44:53.119 align:start position:0%
unless you wanted to require uh put
 
00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
these reports required from these other
 
00:44:57.829 --> 00:44:57.839 align:start position:0%
things like security cameras like uh
 
00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
representative litchfield talked about
 
00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:00.790 align:start position:0%
representative litchfield talked about
um

00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:03.349 --> 00:45:03.359 align:start position:0%
the prenda and kai and and the internet
 
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
classes that and even even uh vlac
 
00:45:09.910 --> 00:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
um what is what's their policy and and
 
00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:12.400 align:start position:0%
are they going to be required under this
 
00:45:15.109 --> 00:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
to come up with a policy um
 
00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
unless that's that's in the total bill
 
00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:20.309 align:start position:0%
unless that's that's in the total bill
um

00:45:20.309 --> 00:45:20.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:24.309 --> 00:45:24.319 align:start position:0%
i i think we're missing the whole point
 
00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you representative tanner um
 
00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:28.550 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you representative tanner um
so

00:45:28.550 --> 00:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:45:30.069 --> 00:45:30.079 align:start position:0%
a couple of things i
 
00:45:32.309 --> 00:45:32.319 align:start position:0%
agree with i just made some notes your
 
00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:34.480 align:start position:0%
points about who would be covered by
 
00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
this uh and you mentioned private
 
00:45:38.710 --> 00:45:38.720 align:start position:0%
schools prenda internet schools uh
 
00:45:40.550 --> 00:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
charter schools uh
 
00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:42.720 align:start position:0%
yeah i i think that
 
00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
whatever comes out of uh this this
 
00:45:46.630 --> 00:45:46.640 align:start position:0%
interim study committee or the full
 
00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
committee this fall or next year
 
00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
if ever or whenever
 
00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
uh i agree i think that
 
00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
this should be applied broadly uh
 
00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:58.230 align:start position:0%
this should be applied broadly uh
to

00:45:58.230 --> 00:45:58.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
you know any any school that gets
 
00:46:03.349 --> 00:46:03.359 align:start position:0%
public support in any fashion directly
 
00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
or indirectly think that they
 
00:46:07.829 --> 00:46:07.839 align:start position:0%
should submit their report but i do want
 
00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
to say that
 
00:46:12.790 --> 00:46:12.800 align:start position:0%
to your point about time is money i
 
00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
tried to address that earlier because
 
00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
this came up with the gifted program and
 
00:46:19.109 --> 00:46:19.119 align:start position:0%
i said this earlier uh i
 
00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
and most of us do not want to
 
00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
impose any egregious administrative
 
00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
burdens and you know i've been out most
 
00:46:30.069 --> 00:46:30.079 align:start position:0%
of us have been out in in that world
 
00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:46:33.829 --> 00:46:33.839 align:start position:0%
as i said earlier
 
00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:36.640 align:start position:0%
this the intent of this could be in my
 
00:46:39.349 --> 00:46:39.359 align:start position:0%
view um as i said before it could be
 
00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
satisfied with an email an attachment so
 
00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
i also want to get into i mean you flag
 
00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of good
 
00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
aspects bus surveillance
 
00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
parking lot surveillance that type of
 
00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:53.829 align:start position:0%
parking lot surveillance that type of
thing

00:46:53.829 --> 00:46:53.839 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:46:56.230 --> 00:46:56.240 align:start position:0%
this is what happened with the gifted
 
00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:57.190 align:start position:0%
this is what happened with the gifted
bill

00:46:57.190 --> 00:46:57.200 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:47:02.390 --> 00:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
um early on in fact chairman ladd um
 
00:47:04.069 --> 00:47:04.079 align:start position:0%
he and i had some conversations he was
 
00:47:05.829 --> 00:47:05.839 align:start position:0%
flagging all these different aspects
 
00:47:07.829 --> 00:47:07.839 align:start position:0%
about gifted as you just did with this
 
00:47:07.839 --> 00:47:08.829 align:start position:0%
about gifted as you just did with this
spell

00:47:08.829 --> 00:47:08.839 align:start position:0%
spell
 
00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
um what
 
00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:12.400 align:start position:0%
we don't want to do what i don't want to
 
00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
do and don't intend to do
 
00:47:17.190 --> 00:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
or want to do is get into any
 
00:47:20.549 --> 00:47:20.559 align:start position:0%
uh specific policies i mean
 
00:47:22.549 --> 00:47:22.559 align:start position:0%
the fact that you and i are having a
 
00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:24.160 align:start position:0%
little bit back and forth and some
 
00:47:25.670 --> 00:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
pieces of this
 
00:47:27.990 --> 00:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
that's the beauty of
 
00:47:31.270 --> 00:47:31.280 align:start position:0%
that's the intent of this bill is to get
 
00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:32.470 align:start position:0%
that's the intent of this bill is to get
districts

00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:47:34.470 --> 00:47:34.480 align:start position:0%
on their own as much as they want to to
 
00:47:37.109 --> 00:47:37.119 align:start position:0%
have discussions and conversations about
 
00:47:39.349 --> 00:47:39.359 align:start position:0%
things that need to be talked about
 
00:47:41.510 --> 00:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
things that need definition especially
 
00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
in this new
 
00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:43.670 align:start position:0%
in this new
world

00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
world
 
00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
so uh there again there is no there's
 
00:47:48.069 --> 00:47:48.079 align:start position:0%
there is no
 
00:47:50.309 --> 00:47:50.319 align:start position:0%
policy mandate there is no spending
 
00:47:50.319 --> 00:47:52.150 align:start position:0%
policy mandate there is no spending
requirement

00:47:52.150 --> 00:47:52.160 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
00:47:54.549 --> 00:47:54.559 align:start position:0%
it's basically asking for an email to go
 
00:47:58.790 --> 00:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
it isn't just an email with an
 
00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
attachment okay
 
00:48:04.069 --> 00:48:04.079 align:start position:0%
somebody at that school let's take
 
00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
kearsarge regional high school which i
 
00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
or kearsarge regional has
 
00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
at least
 
00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
they have three different elementary
 
00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:13.430 align:start position:0%
they have three different elementary
schools

00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:48:15.829 --> 00:48:15.839 align:start position:0%
okay they have a middle school and a
 
00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
high school
 
00:48:18.870 --> 00:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
they have a bus company
 
00:48:21.109 --> 00:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
you're talking about videotaping for
 
00:48:24.390 --> 00:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
example extracurriculars um
 
00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:26.720 align:start position:0%
the the whole package so somebody so
 
00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
they have a basic policy for in
 
00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:30.150 align:start position:0%
they have a basic policy for in
classroom

00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
classroom
 
00:48:32.390 --> 00:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
okay on in the student handbook just
 
00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
like manchester does
 
00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:36.549 align:start position:0%
like manchester does
but

00:48:36.549 --> 00:48:36.559 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
and and this videotaping and student
 
00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:39.910 align:start position:0%
and and this videotaping and student
privacy

00:48:39.910 --> 00:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
privacy
 
00:48:44.230 --> 00:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
puts schools at risk of of lawsuits okay
 
00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:45.270 align:start position:0%
puts schools at risk of of lawsuits okay
so

00:48:45.270 --> 00:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:46.710 align:start position:0%
so
you're

00:48:46.710 --> 00:48:46.720 align:start position:0%
you're
 
00:48:48.630 --> 00:48:48.640 align:start position:0%
you're asking for policies where
 
00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:50.230 align:start position:0%
you're asking for policies where
somebody

00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:52.720 align:start position:0%
somebody in that district whether it's a
 
00:48:55.030 --> 00:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
an administrator or an administrative
 
00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:56.230 align:start position:0%
an administrator or an administrative
secretary

00:48:56.230 --> 00:48:56.240 align:start position:0%
secretary
 
00:48:58.069 --> 00:48:58.079 align:start position:0%
has to accumulate all these different
 
00:48:59.910 --> 00:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
policies that are that are throughout
 
00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
the school
 
00:49:04.069 --> 00:49:04.079 align:start position:0%
okay and then collate them put them in
 
00:49:07.270 --> 00:49:07.280 align:start position:0%
an email and send them to the doe okay
 
00:49:09.270 --> 00:49:09.280 align:start position:0%
that's what they have to do time is
 
00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
money and what i'm saying is if it was
 
00:49:13.349 --> 00:49:13.359 align:start position:0%
just this one
 
00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
you know and i spent half an hour maybe
 
00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
an hour maybe two hours maybe three
 
00:49:20.309 --> 00:49:20.319 align:start position:0%
hours collating this trying to catch up
 
00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
with all the video requirements we have
 
00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
and giving them to the to the
 
00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:27.109 align:start position:0%
and giving them to the to the
administration

00:49:27.109 --> 00:49:27.119 align:start position:0%
administration
 
00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
who then reviews them probably takes
 
00:49:30.870 --> 00:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
them to the school board because now the
 
00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
school board wants them and i know
 
00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
that's part of your issue and then
 
00:49:37.589 --> 00:49:37.599 align:start position:0%
emails them to the doe and may even have
 
00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
to send them to the to the attorney
 
00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
because again these types of privacy
 
00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
issues put districts at risk of lawsuits
 
00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
and the and so if it's going to be
 
00:49:50.390 --> 00:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
published at the at the doe are going to
 
00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
be accumulated at the doe that's
 
00:49:55.109 --> 00:49:55.119 align:start position:0%
concerning so
 
00:49:58.950 --> 00:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
so it's time and and so they've got
 
00:49:59.910 --> 00:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
let's say
 
00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
three four hours for this three four
 
00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
hours for the civics three four hours
 
00:50:05.829 --> 00:50:05.839 align:start position:0%
documenting a whole bunch of other
 
00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
things plus all the special ed stuff
 
00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
they have um even as a classroom teacher
 
00:50:12.870 --> 00:50:12.880 align:start position:0%
you're overwhelmed with paperwork you
 
00:50:15.109 --> 00:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
just keep doing paperwork and it what it
 
00:50:16.549 --> 00:50:16.559 align:start position:0%
does is it takes away from your
 
00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:18.640 align:start position:0%
preparation time it takes away from your
 
00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
school time because you
 
00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
it's it's money
 
00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:23.349 align:start position:0%
it's it's money
so

00:50:23.349 --> 00:50:23.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:50:25.349 --> 00:50:25.359 align:start position:0%
um when you say it's not gonna you know
 
00:50:28.069 --> 00:50:28.079 align:start position:0%
it's just a simple email and a pfd it's
 
00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
not okay
 
00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you representative uh again
 
00:50:34.870 --> 00:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
uh honestly i i just don't see it that
 
00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
way in all candor in all honesty again i
 
00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
go back to representative cornell who
 
00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:42.720 align:start position:0%
looked at the manchester policy uh the
 
00:50:45.589 --> 00:50:45.599 align:start position:0%
intentary intent of those who uh
 
00:50:47.829 --> 00:50:47.839 align:start position:0%
understand what would
 
00:50:49.990 --> 00:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
we'd like to see flow from this
 
00:50:52.470 --> 00:50:52.480 align:start position:0%
everything you just described is
 
00:50:55.270 --> 00:50:55.280 align:start position:0%
is locally public information
 
00:50:57.270 --> 00:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
so again i've said this couple of times
 
00:50:59.349 --> 00:50:59.359 align:start position:0%
i just don't have the same concerns that
 
00:51:03.349 --> 00:51:03.359 align:start position:0%
you do i don't we don't want to uh force
 
00:51:05.109 --> 00:51:05.119 align:start position:0%
any district to do
 
00:51:07.829 --> 00:51:07.839 align:start position:0%
any policy making we just
 
00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
as with the gifted bill
 
00:51:11.349 --> 00:51:11.359 align:start position:0%
would like district to share what they
 
00:51:14.230 --> 00:51:14.240 align:start position:0%

00:51:15.829 --> 00:51:15.839 align:start position:0%

just i don't at all see or have the same
 
00:51:24.309 --> 00:51:24.319 align:start position:0%
concerns about this creating an onerous
 
00:51:24.319 --> 00:51:25.510 align:start position:0%
concerns about this creating an onerous
onerous

00:51:25.510 --> 00:51:25.520 align:start position:0%

thanks very much mike um

so just um just a few points um i wanted
 
00:51:53.910 --> 00:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
to to get at listening to what's been
 
00:51:56.069 --> 00:51:56.079 align:start position:0%
made here and and uh and
 
00:51:58.309 --> 00:51:58.319 align:start position:0%
i think um i think melissa made some
 
00:52:00.309 --> 00:52:00.319 align:start position:0%
some very good points and observations
 
00:52:01.430 --> 00:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:52:03.990 --> 00:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
with some very justifiable concerns with
 
00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:06.800 align:start position:0%
respect to um
 
00:52:10.549 --> 00:52:10.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:13.030 --> 00:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
audio and video streaming and and you
 
00:52:15.589 --> 00:52:15.599 align:start position:0%
know the potential um
 
00:52:17.430 --> 00:52:17.440 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences that could go
 
00:52:18.870 --> 00:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
along with that
 
00:52:21.750 --> 00:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
but i also wanted to to address another
 
00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:23.270 align:start position:0%
but i also wanted to to address another
comment

00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
comment
 
00:52:24.870 --> 00:52:24.880 align:start position:0%
she made with respect to the new
 
00:52:27.190 --> 00:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire school boards association
 
00:52:28.549 --> 00:52:28.559 align:start position:0%
she mentioned it's a lobbying
 
00:52:30.630 --> 00:52:30.640 align:start position:0%
organization lobbying certainly one of
 
00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:31.589 align:start position:0%
organization lobbying certainly one of
their

00:52:31.589 --> 00:52:31.599 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:52:32.870 --> 00:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
things they have a govern government
 
00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:34.870 align:start position:0%
things they have a govern government
affairs

00:52:34.870 --> 00:52:34.880 align:start position:0%
affairs
 
00:52:37.829 --> 00:52:37.839 align:start position:0%
aspect to it but in my experience being
 
00:52:40.230 --> 00:52:40.240 align:start position:0%
on a school board
 
00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
i really didn't see so much of their
 
00:52:43.510 --> 00:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
their lobbying
 
00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:46.640 align:start position:0%
or government affairs effort as i did
 
00:52:49.109 --> 00:52:49.119 align:start position:0%
see their their best practices when
 
00:52:51.829 --> 00:52:51.839 align:start position:0%
submitting when preparing
 
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
model policy development for school
 
00:52:57.510 --> 00:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
boards and in hopkinton we would start
 
00:53:00.549 --> 00:53:00.559 align:start position:0%
with with that and um and we would tune
 
00:53:03.990 --> 00:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
it to be specific to our our district
 
00:53:05.829 --> 00:53:05.839 align:start position:0%
but at least we had something that was a
 
00:53:08.069 --> 00:53:08.079 align:start position:0%
good start very good solid starting
 
00:53:10.470 --> 00:53:10.480 align:start position:0%
point uh based on
 
00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
not just work here in new hampshire but
 
00:53:14.069 --> 00:53:14.079 align:start position:0%
probably i'm assuming work in other
 
00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
states uh as well so so um so i think
 
00:53:20.470 --> 00:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
there's a lot to that organization and
 
00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
um and i appreciate all the the work um
 
00:53:26.790 --> 00:53:26.800 align:start position:0%
uh and experience and skill that they
 
00:53:29.670 --> 00:53:29.680 align:start position:0%
that they bring to uh to school boards
 
00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
um uh throughout the state
 
00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:32.640 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:53:34.230 --> 00:53:34.240 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:53:36.309 --> 00:53:36.319 align:start position:0%
really the next thing i think and and
 
00:53:39.270 --> 00:53:39.280 align:start position:0%
this is something that that that melissa
 
00:53:43.510 --> 00:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
um was was very emphatic on um uh
 
00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
and i and we've heard from the
 
00:53:47.829 --> 00:53:47.839 align:start position:0%
department how how job one is student
 
00:53:47.839 --> 00:53:49.030 align:start position:0%
department how how job one is student
safety

00:53:49.030 --> 00:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
safety
 
00:53:51.910 --> 00:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
and uh and you know uh diana and the
 
00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner speak about it all the time
 
00:53:55.829 --> 00:53:55.839 align:start position:0%
you know student safety is an important
 
00:53:55.839 --> 00:53:56.630 align:start position:0%
you know student safety is an important
thing

00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:53:57.910 --> 00:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:53:59.510 --> 00:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
my concern
 
00:54:01.270 --> 00:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
or a concern
 
00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
about having a folder with with i won't
 
00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
even call them best practices but
 
00:54:09.270 --> 00:54:09.280 align:start position:0%
practices of each school district with
 
00:54:10.950 --> 00:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
regards to um
 
00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:14.480 align:start position:0%
um uh cla you know classroom uh audio
 
00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:15.430 align:start position:0%
um uh cla you know classroom uh audio
video

00:54:15.430 --> 00:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
video
 
00:54:19.750 --> 00:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
um uh and um and in classroom observers
 
00:54:22.390 --> 00:54:22.400 align:start position:0%
uh would be now we've have we created
 
00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
like a one-stop shop for anybody to just
 
00:54:26.309 --> 00:54:26.319 align:start position:0%
go through and say hey you know what i'm
 
00:54:28.950 --> 00:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
going to look at at all of these and see
 
00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
which one just happens to say
 
00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:32.549 align:start position:0%
which one just happens to say
that

00:54:32.549 --> 00:54:32.559 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:33.680 align:start position:0%
that that
 
00:54:35.270 --> 00:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
a a
 
00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
a class
 
00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
has to be delivered
 
00:54:43.109 --> 00:54:43.119 align:start position:0%
both in person and remote and that
 
00:54:46.470 --> 00:54:46.480 align:start position:0%
classroom observation uh is allowed
 
00:54:49.270 --> 00:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
either way in person or remote and
 
00:54:52.309 --> 00:54:52.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily limit it to uh to
 
00:54:55.190 --> 00:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
any you know particular individual
 
00:54:58.549 --> 00:54:58.559 align:start position:0%
uh such as a parent or a guardian or or
 
00:55:01.270 --> 00:55:01.280 align:start position:0%
or or somebody but opens the door wide
 
00:55:03.829 --> 00:55:03.839 align:start position:0%
open and so you know have we created a
 
00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
one-stop shop for somebody to go oh
 
00:55:09.510 --> 00:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
i see what's going on here
 
00:55:11.589 --> 00:55:11.599 align:start position:0%
i could just go over to this school
 
00:55:13.510 --> 00:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
district and
 
00:55:15.190 --> 00:55:15.200 align:start position:0%
you know what if they don't let me in
 
00:55:16.870 --> 00:55:16.880 align:start position:0%
then they're breaking their own board
 
00:55:18.630 --> 00:55:18.640 align:start position:0%
policy and if they're breaking their own
 
00:55:20.950 --> 00:55:20.960 align:start position:0%
board policy it's going to happen
 
00:55:22.789 --> 00:55:22.799 align:start position:0%
exactly what representative tanner said
 
00:55:25.510 --> 00:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
it's going to spark a lawsuit
 
00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
because that's what policies are are
 
00:55:31.349 --> 00:55:31.359 align:start position:0%
really there to to provide is a
 
00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
consistent clear
 
00:55:33.520 --> 00:55:35.270 align:start position:0%
consistent clear
um

00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:38.950 --> 00:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
a requirement independent of anybody's
 
00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:41.680 align:start position:0%
sort of best thinking like maybe a
 
00:55:43.910 --> 00:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
teachers or or principal building
 
00:55:46.950 --> 00:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
principal or the superintendent um you
 
00:55:48.789 --> 00:55:48.799 align:start position:0%
know best thinking given a certain
 
00:55:51.750 --> 00:55:51.760 align:start position:0%
situation creates a black and white um
 
00:55:55.349 --> 00:55:55.359 align:start position:0%
um policy that that um that that applies
 
00:55:58.150 --> 00:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
independent of any any um knowledge of
 
00:56:00.950 --> 00:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
what may be going on at the time um and
 
00:56:04.789 --> 00:56:04.799 align:start position:0%
then i guess the the the third um uh
 
00:56:07.910 --> 00:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
thing is before we sort of jump in to
 
00:56:10.069 --> 00:56:10.079 align:start position:0%
creating the office of the file cabinet
 
00:56:12.710 --> 00:56:12.720 align:start position:0%
the best practices file cabinet um you
 
00:56:15.030 --> 00:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
know let's let's see what happens with
 
00:56:17.670 --> 00:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
this this first folder with with the
 
00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
gifted students i took a look at the
 
00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:21.589 align:start position:0%
gifted students i took a look at the
statute

00:56:21.589 --> 00:56:21.599 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:56:24.069 --> 00:56:24.079 align:start position:0%
and and it went into effect
 
00:56:26.150 --> 00:56:26.160 align:start position:0%
uh july 23rd
 
00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:27.589 align:start position:0%
uh july 23rd
2021

00:56:27.589 --> 00:56:27.599 align:start position:0%
2021
 
00:56:30.670 --> 00:56:30.680 align:start position:0%
it applies beginning to the
 
00:56:32.789 --> 00:56:32.799 align:start position:0%
2022-2023 school year which is the
 
00:56:34.549 --> 00:56:34.559 align:start position:0%
school year where
 
00:56:37.750 --> 00:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
we'll will be in as of um
 
00:56:41.349 --> 00:56:41.359 align:start position:0%
july 1st and it says by august 1st of
 
00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
that year so
 
00:56:45.990 --> 00:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
so this will be due this summer is when
 
00:56:47.670 --> 00:56:47.680 align:start position:0%
um is when
 
00:56:51.190 --> 00:56:51.200 align:start position:0%
uh school districts will uh shall submit
 
00:56:53.109 --> 00:56:53.119 align:start position:0%
to the department of education no later
 
00:56:55.430 --> 00:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
than august first an annual narrative
 
00:56:57.349 --> 00:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
report detailing the policies programs
 
00:56:59.750 --> 00:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
procedures that are um for gift for
 
00:57:03.030 --> 00:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
gifted students so i i think we're we're
 
00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
we're way too early to say it's making a
 
00:57:08.789 --> 00:57:08.799 align:start position:0%
big difference or anything uh like that
 
00:57:10.309 --> 00:57:10.319 align:start position:0%
at this point because
 
00:57:12.549 --> 00:57:12.559 align:start position:0%
you know the the the
 
00:57:15.349 --> 00:57:15.359 align:start position:0%
the the the due date for even putting
 
00:57:17.430 --> 00:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
things into this folder hasn't even
 
00:57:21.670 --> 00:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
hasn't even come yet and um and so uh
 
00:57:23.349 --> 00:57:23.359 align:start position:0%
we don't know we don't know if it makes
 
00:57:26.470 --> 00:57:26.480 align:start position:0%
a big difference we don't know how how
 
00:57:29.430 --> 00:57:29.440 align:start position:0%
time um how much time is involved on the
 
00:57:31.430 --> 00:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
part of the school district but
 
00:57:35.270 --> 00:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
certainly some time uh is involved and
 
00:57:36.710 --> 00:57:36.720 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
00:57:37.589 --> 00:57:37.599 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:57:41.270 --> 00:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
let's i probably starting with with with
 
00:57:43.349 --> 00:57:43.359 align:start position:0%
the bill with representative moffett's
 
00:57:44.470 --> 00:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
bill from
 
00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
from last year uh with respect to best
 
00:57:49.430 --> 00:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
practices for gifted students you know
 
00:57:53.109 --> 00:57:53.119 align:start position:0%
what maybe that's sort of a
 
00:57:55.750 --> 00:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
good place to start to sort of root out
 
00:57:58.789 --> 00:57:58.799 align:start position:0%
how effective this file cabinet is is
 
00:58:00.069 --> 00:58:00.079 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
00:58:03.510 --> 00:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
without potentially putting something in
 
00:58:06.150 --> 00:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
there that is going to compromise
 
00:58:09.510 --> 00:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
student safety or or create a channel
 
00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
for somebody with with you know maybe
 
00:58:15.430 --> 00:58:15.440 align:start position:0%
you know motivations that that are
 
00:58:18.870 --> 00:58:18.880 align:start position:0%
inconsistent with with student safety um
 
00:58:20.390 --> 00:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
because it wouldn't appear to me that
 
00:58:21.430 --> 00:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
the gifted
 
00:58:25.670 --> 00:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
folder would would have that type of um
 
00:58:27.190 --> 00:58:27.200 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:58:31.270 --> 00:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
problem um with it so so you know i'm
 
00:58:34.630 --> 00:58:34.640 align:start position:0%
i'm sort of thinking let's let's
 
00:58:36.789 --> 00:58:36.799 align:start position:0%
let's see what happens with with with
 
00:58:38.470 --> 00:58:38.480 align:start position:0%
what's already been done
 
00:58:39.829 --> 00:58:39.839 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
and um uh and then you know this could
 
00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:43.750 align:start position:0%
and um uh and then you know this could
be

00:58:43.750 --> 00:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:58:46.710 --> 00:58:46.720 align:start position:0%
you know uh looked at down the road but
 
00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
uh but clearly i think we're we're
 
00:58:50.390 --> 00:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
getting into a very
 
00:58:53.109 --> 00:58:53.119 align:start position:0%
sensitive area districts may do things
 
00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
differently depending upon the interests
 
00:58:56.870 --> 00:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
of their local school boards
 
00:58:58.470 --> 00:58:58.480 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:59:01.510 --> 00:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
um and i hate to see it be used for for
 
00:59:04.390 --> 00:59:04.400 align:start position:0%
purposes that we're not going to improve
 
00:59:07.829 --> 00:59:07.839 align:start position:0%
and further um you know um
 
00:59:10.710 --> 00:59:10.720 align:start position:0%
student outcomes so thanks
 
00:59:12.549 --> 00:59:12.559 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you representative luno and i
 
00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
agree with your point about practices
 
00:59:16.870 --> 00:59:16.880 align:start position:0%
versus best practices best practices is
 
00:59:19.109 --> 00:59:19.119 align:start position:0%
kind of a term but i i think you're
 
00:59:19.119 --> 00:59:20.710 align:start position:0%
kind of a term but i i think you're
right

00:59:20.710 --> 00:59:20.720 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:59:24.069 --> 00:59:24.079 align:start position:0%
practices uh what's a good practice for
 
00:59:25.510 --> 00:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
some might not be seen as a good
 
00:59:27.430 --> 00:59:27.440 align:start position:0%
practice for others
 
00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:28.710 align:start position:0%
practice for others
um

00:59:28.710 --> 00:59:28.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:30.390 --> 00:59:30.400 align:start position:0%
and i want to make one other comment and
 
00:59:32.950 --> 00:59:32.960 align:start position:0%
then of course we're all it's a work
 
00:59:34.390 --> 00:59:34.400 align:start position:0%
session but uh
 
00:59:36.309 --> 00:59:36.319 align:start position:0%
diana attorney fenton is in the house
 
00:59:39.109 --> 00:59:39.119 align:start position:0%
and i i i think some of us would like to
 
00:59:40.870 --> 00:59:40.880 align:start position:0%
get a perspective from her i wanted to
 
00:59:44.069 --> 00:59:44.079 align:start position:0%
make i'm going to say two things before
 
00:59:44.079 --> 00:59:45.750 align:start position:0%
make i'm going to say two things before
um

00:59:45.750 --> 00:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:47.990 --> 00:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
one of which um
 
00:59:49.990 --> 00:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
to go back to the gifted bill as i've
 
00:59:52.069 --> 00:59:52.079 align:start position:0%
we've said many times that's a model for
 
00:59:53.430 --> 00:59:53.440 align:start position:0%
this approach
 
00:59:53.440 --> 00:59:54.470 align:start position:0%
this approach
um

00:59:54.470 --> 00:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:55.190 align:start position:0%
um
the

00:59:55.190 --> 00:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:59:57.750 --> 00:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
the five to two vote we did take a vote
 
01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
on um gifted a couple terms ago
 
01:00:03.270 --> 01:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
one of the two who voted against it you
 
01:00:05.910 --> 01:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
know his public record was chairman lat
 
01:00:08.309 --> 01:00:08.319 align:start position:0%
and um i just
 
01:00:10.549 --> 01:00:10.559 align:start position:0%
had conversation after conversation with
 
01:00:13.349 --> 01:00:13.359 align:start position:0%
rick about um the gifted bill
 
01:00:15.990 --> 01:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
and and he's a smart guy and he knows a
 
01:00:17.829 --> 01:00:17.839 align:start position:0%
lot of and he's flagging all these
 
01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
questions what about this what about
 
01:00:20.309 --> 01:00:20.319 align:start position:0%
that what about this or what are we
 
01:00:21.190 --> 01:00:21.200 align:start position:0%
going to think about this kind of thing
 
01:00:23.589 --> 01:00:23.599 align:start position:0%
but that uh on and on and on and he
 
01:00:23.599 --> 01:00:24.710 align:start position:0%
but that uh on and on and on and he
finally

01:00:24.710 --> 01:00:24.720 align:start position:0%
finally
 
01:00:28.069 --> 01:00:28.079 align:start position:0%
uh he unders understood
 
01:00:30.069 --> 01:00:30.079 align:start position:0%
the intent is why he eventually
 
01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
supported it
 
01:00:34.710 --> 01:00:34.720 align:start position:0%
i said chairman i said rick
 
01:00:38.150 --> 01:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
all these things that you're flagging
 
01:00:40.710 --> 01:00:40.720 align:start position:0%
makes the point of the intent of the
 
01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
bill these are things that need
 
01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:46.630 align:start position:0%
bill these are things that need
discussion

01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:50.710 --> 01:00:50.720 align:start position:0%
we don't want to impose any
 
01:00:53.829 --> 01:00:53.839 align:start position:0%
policy we just want to gather and gather
 
01:00:56.789 --> 01:00:56.799 align:start position:0%
existing public information into one
 
01:00:59.670 --> 01:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
spot for the convenience of those but
 
01:01:01.990 --> 01:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
i hope and finally he
 
01:01:04.789 --> 01:01:04.799 align:start position:0%
came around and understood that in the
 
01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
process of
 
01:01:08.829 --> 01:01:08.839 align:start position:0%
requiring this information to be
 
01:01:12.230 --> 01:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
submitted and via again i i'll say i
 
01:01:13.990 --> 01:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
don't think it was egregious just send
 
01:01:15.670 --> 01:01:15.680 align:start position:0%
us what you have in place
 
01:01:17.910 --> 01:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
but this districts in the schools that
 
01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
don't didn't in the gifted case that
 
01:01:21.349 --> 01:01:21.359 align:start position:0%
didn't have anything in place or that
 
01:01:23.109 --> 01:01:23.119 align:start position:0%
don't have anything in place
 
01:01:25.349 --> 01:01:25.359 align:start position:0%
out of that comes the conversation so
 
01:01:26.789 --> 01:01:26.799 align:start position:0%
the same thing here representative
 
01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
tanner uh as representative vlad did is
 
01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
fl and you just now flagging all these
 
01:01:34.630 --> 01:01:34.640 align:start position:0%
potential concerns and my answer to you
 
01:01:35.589 --> 01:01:35.599 align:start position:0%
is what i
 
01:01:38.069 --> 01:01:38.079 align:start position:0%
kept saying to to rick i said rick those
 
01:01:39.829 --> 01:01:39.839 align:start position:0%
are all great questions but
 
01:01:40.789 --> 01:01:40.799 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:01:43.270 --> 01:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
we're not asking we're not asking for
 
01:01:46.549 --> 01:01:46.559 align:start position:0%
any policy we're just asking uh for what
 
01:01:48.390 --> 01:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
you have for information and if any
 
01:01:51.510 --> 01:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
districts aren't paying attention or
 
01:01:53.750 --> 01:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason and through this
 
01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:55.430 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason and through this
process

01:01:55.430 --> 01:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:01:57.829 --> 01:01:57.839 align:start position:0%
a gap is identified that needs attention
 
01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
locally then that's up to the districts
 
01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:01.270 align:start position:0%
locally then that's up to the districts
to

01:02:01.270 --> 01:02:01.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:02:03.670 --> 01:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
have that local conversation and fill in
 
01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
those gaps however they want to so
 
01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
anyway and then the last point i wanted
 
01:02:09.589 --> 01:02:09.599 align:start position:0%
to make was um
 
01:02:11.109 --> 01:02:11.119 align:start position:0%
on this bill and also the bill this
 
01:02:13.910 --> 01:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
afternoon um representative hobson and i
 
01:02:16.390 --> 01:02:16.400 align:start position:0%
had uh stopped by deal we've
 
01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
whenever that was we had a
 
01:02:20.309 --> 01:02:20.319 align:start position:0%
chat with caitlin and the commissioner
 
01:02:23.910 --> 01:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
came by just informally talking about um
 
01:02:27.190 --> 01:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
some of the last year's legislation and
 
01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
getting some some thought mckenzie was
 
01:02:30.950 --> 01:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
there and
 
01:02:33.430 --> 01:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
a guy named scott came by and we just
 
01:02:35.829 --> 01:02:35.839 align:start position:0%
talked about um
 
01:02:37.589 --> 01:02:37.599 align:start position:0%
some stuff that was on radar screens and
 
01:02:39.910 --> 01:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
we asked them some questions and diana's
 
01:02:42.390 --> 01:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
here and she can
 
01:02:44.549 --> 01:02:44.559 align:start position:0%
hopefully provide a little bit of input
 
01:02:46.150 --> 01:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
from doe
 
01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:47.349 align:start position:0%
from doe
so

01:02:47.349 --> 01:02:47.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:02:51.270 --> 01:02:51.280 align:start position:0%
there was from that informal uh confab
 
01:02:55.589 --> 01:02:55.599 align:start position:0%
um we got some notes and ideas as to uh
 
01:02:55.599 --> 01:02:56.309 align:start position:0%
um we got some notes and ideas as to uh
how

01:02:56.309 --> 01:02:56.319 align:start position:0%
how
 
01:02:58.390 --> 01:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
some of the folks at doe
 
01:03:04.549 --> 01:03:04.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:04.559 --> 01:03:05.910 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:03:05.910 --> 01:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:03:07.990 --> 01:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
classroom recording
 
01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:08.950 align:start position:0%
classroom recording
issue

01:03:08.950 --> 01:03:08.960 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:03:11.670 --> 01:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
so anyway uh
 
01:03:12.710 --> 01:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
these are things that we've been
 
01:03:15.109 --> 01:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
discussing for a while it's it's nothing
 
01:03:17.190 --> 01:03:17.200 align:start position:0%
that just you know popped up
 
01:03:19.109 --> 01:03:19.119 align:start position:0%
uh other
 
01:03:21.670 --> 01:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
anybody else before we ask
 
01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:24.150 align:start position:0%
anybody else before we ask
sure

01:03:24.150 --> 01:03:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:03:28.150 --> 01:03:28.160 align:start position:0%
i do completely agree with the safety
 
01:03:30.710 --> 01:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
and security aspect 100
 
01:03:32.549 --> 01:03:32.559 align:start position:0%
i do have to say though at this point in
 
01:03:34.789 --> 01:03:34.799 align:start position:0%
time we've all been required to put
 
01:03:36.870 --> 01:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
together our safety plans right there's
 
01:03:39.109 --> 01:03:39.119 align:start position:0%
housed in central location at this point
 
01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
in time i'm assuming homeland security
 
01:03:43.349 --> 01:03:43.359 align:start position:0%
but they're housed in the central
 
01:03:43.359 --> 01:03:45.829 align:start position:0%
but they're housed in the central
location

01:03:45.829 --> 01:03:45.839 align:start position:0%
location
 
01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
my thought is just
 
01:03:50.309 --> 01:03:50.319 align:start position:0%
now that we all have
 
01:03:52.549 --> 01:03:52.559 align:start position:0%
a mini computer that we carry around
 
01:03:54.069 --> 01:03:54.079 align:start position:0%
most kids do
 
01:03:54.079 --> 01:03:56.069 align:start position:0%
most kids do
right

01:03:56.069 --> 01:03:56.079 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:03:56.079 --> 01:03:57.190 align:start position:0%
right
yeah

01:03:57.190 --> 01:03:57.200 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:58.470 align:start position:0%
yeah
right

01:03:58.470 --> 01:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:02.309 align:start position:0%
right
no

01:04:02.309 --> 01:04:02.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:04.710 --> 01:04:04.720 align:start position:0%
yeah just the safety plans for homeland
 
01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
sec homeland security i think that was
 
01:04:09.109 --> 01:04:09.119 align:start position:0%
in a recent bill that we passed i don't
 
01:04:12.069 --> 01:04:12.079 align:start position:0%
recall and maybe diana has this if those
 
01:04:14.549 --> 01:04:14.559 align:start position:0%
are available for public inspection they
 
01:04:16.549 --> 01:04:16.559 align:start position:0%
are not available for public inspection
 
01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
but this wouldn't be available for
 
01:04:19.990 --> 01:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
public inspection i thought the question
 
01:04:21.589 --> 01:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
was just it would be in a centralized
 
01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
location at doe correct this is
 
01:04:27.589 --> 01:04:27.599 align:start position:0%
available for public inspection
 
01:04:29.430 --> 01:04:29.440 align:start position:0%
okay that sorry that wasn't my
 
01:04:31.589 --> 01:04:31.599 align:start position:0%
interpretation unless it unless it
 
01:04:31.599 --> 01:04:32.630 align:start position:0%
interpretation unless it unless it
clearly

01:04:32.630 --> 01:04:32.640 align:start position:0%
clearly
 
01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
um states that it is not um
 
01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
a 91a maybe that's something
 
01:04:39.190 --> 01:04:39.200 align:start position:0%
that we could do
 
01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
um i'm just wondering now i guess my
 
01:04:43.589 --> 01:04:43.599 align:start position:0%
point is we all have devices schools are
 
01:04:45.829 --> 01:04:45.839 align:start position:0%
at this point requiring devices if not
 
01:04:47.589 --> 01:04:47.599 align:start position:0%
even assigning them even to elementary
 
01:04:50.630 --> 01:04:50.640 align:start position:0%
kids that go remote did go remote or
 
01:04:54.230 --> 01:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
even to utilize i'm just wondering if
 
01:04:56.549 --> 01:04:56.559 align:start position:0%
it's time that we need to consider some
 
01:04:59.589 --> 01:04:59.599 align:start position:0%
type of high-level broad framework jim
 
01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
saying i know that the big saying is to
 
01:05:03.430 --> 01:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
kick the can isn't it time that we
 
01:05:05.990 --> 01:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
address video recordings it's it's so
 
01:05:08.230 --> 01:05:08.240 align:start position:0%
widespread at this point in time just
 
01:05:14.390 --> 01:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:17.029 align:start position:0%
 
districts

01:05:17.029 --> 01:05:17.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:19.029 --> 01:05:19.039 align:start position:0%
i believe school districts are if
 
01:05:20.549 --> 01:05:20.559 align:start position:0%
they're going to
 
01:05:20.559 --> 01:05:21.430 align:start position:0%
they're going to
have

01:05:21.430 --> 01:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:05:23.829 --> 01:05:23.839 align:start position:0%
have any sort of video surveillance on
 
01:05:26.870 --> 01:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
school property that they have to have a
 
01:05:28.549 --> 01:05:28.559 align:start position:0%
policy and they have to hold a public
 
01:05:31.109 --> 01:05:31.119 align:start position:0%
hearing as as you mentioned uh prior to
 
01:05:32.309 --> 01:05:32.319 align:start position:0%
that i i
 
01:05:34.950 --> 01:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
i don't think that districts can just
 
01:05:36.870 --> 01:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
set up cameras and
 
01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
move on
 
01:05:40.470 --> 01:05:40.480 align:start position:0%
i guess i just don't understand why is
 
01:05:42.390 --> 01:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
it an issue if we house this information
 
01:05:44.950 --> 01:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
at doe in the central location we just
 
01:05:47.430 --> 01:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
we ran into this even with the saus and
 
01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
how they're set up we have local control
 
01:05:52.230 --> 01:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
which we pride ourselves on but we're
 
01:05:54.150 --> 01:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
scattered we have so many different
 
01:05:56.309 --> 01:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
things happening i just don't understand
 
01:05:59.029 --> 01:05:59.039 align:start position:0%
why we don't try to centralize that and
 
01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
maybe come up with best practices as you
 
01:06:03.109 --> 01:06:03.119 align:start position:0%
mentioned i i'm
 
01:06:05.109 --> 01:06:05.119 align:start position:0%
not trying to be argumentative i'm truly
 
01:06:07.589 --> 01:06:07.599 align:start position:0%
trying to grasp this and understand why
 
01:06:14.390 --> 01:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:16.950 --> 01:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you uh
 
01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
representative hall just a quick
 
01:06:20.789 --> 01:06:20.799 align:start position:0%
question so a school district could put
 
01:06:23.029 --> 01:06:23.039 align:start position:0%
in their report we don't do anything for
 
01:06:25.109 --> 01:06:25.119 align:start position:0%
gifted and talented or we don't have any
 
01:06:27.109 --> 01:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
policy and that's the report year after
 
01:06:28.950 --> 01:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
year they can put that report in and and
 
01:06:30.470 --> 01:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
we're making an assumption that that
 
01:06:32.230 --> 01:06:32.240 align:start position:0%
school district is going to say whoa all
 
01:06:33.430 --> 01:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
these other school districts have
 
01:06:34.630 --> 01:06:34.640 align:start position:0%
something maybe we need to look at
 
01:06:37.349 --> 01:06:37.359 align:start position:0%
something is that what the intent is
 
01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:39.839 align:start position:0%
sure uh in fact uh the link that
 
01:06:41.510 --> 01:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
represents robertson shared with me when
 
01:06:43.430 --> 01:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
they saw what d.o.e put out is a
 
01:06:46.470 --> 01:06:46.480 align:start position:0%
technical advisory they said with regard
 
01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
to gifted if you have no policies in
 
01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:49.910 align:start position:0%
to gifted if you have no policies in
place

01:06:49.910 --> 01:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:06:52.309 --> 01:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
just tell us that so
 
01:06:54.549 --> 01:06:54.559 align:start position:0%
if districts don't have policies in
 
01:06:56.309 --> 01:06:56.319 align:start position:0%
place and don't want to have policies in
 
01:06:58.950 --> 01:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
place that's up to the district
 
01:07:01.589 --> 01:07:01.599 align:start position:0%
so um but again as i said before the
 
01:07:04.069 --> 01:07:04.079 align:start position:0%
intent of that bill and this bill is to
 
01:07:07.829 --> 01:07:07.839 align:start position:0%
encourage uh through statute um
 
01:07:10.390 --> 01:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
districts locally to identify gaps and
 
01:07:12.870 --> 01:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
maybe talk about them
 
01:07:15.349 --> 01:07:15.359 align:start position:0%
and if they in the gifted case if if the
 
01:07:17.349 --> 01:07:17.359 align:start position:0%
district never puts anything into place
 
01:07:20.549 --> 01:07:20.559 align:start position:0%
they that's okay you know the intent is
 
01:07:23.270 --> 01:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
not to mandate anything it's just to
 
01:07:25.270 --> 01:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
get it on the radar screens because
 
01:07:26.789 --> 01:07:26.799 align:start position:0%
there's some things like the gifted
 
01:07:28.630 --> 01:07:28.640 align:start position:0%
things why it's law and why we're having
 
01:07:31.029 --> 01:07:31.039 align:start position:0%
this discussion here there are
 
01:07:32.710 --> 01:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
some districts
 
01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
have some things in place and some don't
 
01:07:37.029 --> 01:07:37.039 align:start position:0%
so out of this with no mandate no
 
01:07:39.670 --> 01:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
spending requirement
 
01:07:41.990 --> 01:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
the vision is that these gaps will end
 
01:07:43.750 --> 01:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
up being filled which otherwise would
 
01:07:46.630 --> 01:07:46.640 align:start position:0%
not be had we not shined a light or
 
01:07:48.710 --> 01:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
had had this uh discussion in this
 
01:07:52.309 --> 01:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
potential statute represent
 
01:07:54.630 --> 01:07:54.640 align:start position:0%
i don't know if this question is for you
 
01:07:57.510 --> 01:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
or for attorney fenton
 
01:08:00.470 --> 01:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
but i went just went to the doe
 
01:08:01.510 --> 01:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:08:04.549 --> 01:08:04.559 align:start position:0%
advisory the technical advisory
 
01:08:04.559 --> 01:08:05.829 align:start position:0%
advisory the technical advisory
and

01:08:05.829 --> 01:08:05.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:08:05.839 --> 01:08:07.990 align:start position:0%
and
um

01:08:07.990 --> 01:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:11.670 --> 01:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
it has a survey that the department of
 
01:08:15.430 --> 01:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
education made for people to fill out
 
01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
and it's part of this ess system um
 
01:08:21.910 --> 01:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
survey page of the css system
 
01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:23.030 align:start position:0%
survey page of the css system
and

01:08:23.030 --> 01:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:08:25.269 --> 01:08:25.279 align:start position:0%
when i went to look at the survey
 
01:08:27.590 --> 01:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
i couldn't get into the survey
 
01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
okay so i have no idea
 
01:08:32.309 --> 01:08:32.319 align:start position:0%
what questions are being asked or why
 
01:08:33.669 --> 01:08:33.679 align:start position:0%
they're being asked from the state
 
01:08:35.510 --> 01:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
01:08:37.590 --> 01:08:37.600 align:start position:0%
and i guess
 
01:08:39.749 --> 01:08:39.759 align:start position:0%
my whole thing about
 
01:08:42.630 --> 01:08:42.640 align:start position:0%
centralized data is
 
01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:43.510 align:start position:0%
centralized data is
why

01:08:43.510 --> 01:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:08:46.550 --> 01:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
do you need centralized data and
 
01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:47.590 align:start position:0%
do you need centralized data and
who

01:08:47.590 --> 01:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
who
 
01:08:50.709 --> 01:08:50.719 align:start position:0%
or whom is going to be using that data
 
01:08:52.630 --> 01:08:52.640 align:start position:0%
and for what purpose are they going to
 
01:08:54.789 --> 01:08:54.799 align:start position:0%
use that data i mean if
 
01:08:56.630 --> 01:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
all you wanted was to have school
 
01:08:58.630 --> 01:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
districts have a discussion
 
01:09:01.349 --> 01:09:01.359 align:start position:0%
all the doe would have to do would be to
 
01:09:02.950 --> 01:09:02.960 align:start position:0%
put out their own
 
01:09:05.030 --> 01:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh notice that says
 
01:09:06.789 --> 01:09:06.799 align:start position:0%
you know um
 
01:09:08.550 --> 01:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
we think that it would be important for
 
01:09:09.990 --> 01:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
you to develop
 
01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:11.189 align:start position:0%
you to develop
um

01:09:11.189 --> 01:09:11.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:11.199 --> 01:09:12.470 align:start position:0%
um
video

01:09:12.470 --> 01:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
video
 
01:09:15.110 --> 01:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
surveillance and video uh whatever
 
01:09:18.630 --> 01:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
you've done with your zoom classes um
 
01:09:21.030 --> 01:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
to to uh
 
01:09:23.430 --> 01:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
address that subject the same thing with
 
01:09:25.990 --> 01:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
gifted and talented all they had to do
 
01:09:28.149 --> 01:09:28.159 align:start position:0%
was to send out a notice to the schools
 
01:09:29.430 --> 01:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
that say
 
01:09:31.110 --> 01:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
you know we're discussing gifted and
 
01:09:33.269 --> 01:09:33.279 align:start position:0%
talented and
 
01:09:34.950 --> 01:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
we think you need a discussion on the
 
01:09:36.789 --> 01:09:36.799 align:start position:0%
local level
 
01:09:38.789 --> 01:09:38.799 align:start position:0%
why do they
 
01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
why do they need a central database
 
01:09:43.669 --> 01:09:43.679 align:start position:0%
where they're collecting more
 
01:09:47.430 --> 01:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
information about schools and students
 
01:09:48.789 --> 01:09:48.799 align:start position:0%
at the doe
 
01:09:51.829 --> 01:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
that that's one of my and also
 
01:09:53.910 --> 01:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
who's developing the surveys and what do
 
01:09:55.990 --> 01:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
the surveys look like because the way
 
01:09:58.630 --> 01:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
the surveys are are worded could make a
 
01:10:00.790 --> 01:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
um you know significant difference on
 
01:10:03.430 --> 01:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
how how the date is collected
 
01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:04.630 align:start position:0%
how how the date is collected
um

01:10:04.630 --> 01:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:07.350 --> 01:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
i just think that it's um
 
01:10:09.590 --> 01:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
you know the the
 
01:10:12.870 --> 01:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
the risk is at the local level and um a
 
01:10:15.990 --> 01:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
few years ago we passed a bill i believe
 
01:10:18.070 --> 01:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli was the sponsor
 
01:10:19.350 --> 01:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
of it
 
01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
that said that um any internet
 
01:10:24.790 --> 01:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
connection from schools
 
01:10:27.830 --> 01:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh had to agree to a total privacy
 
01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:29.110 align:start position:0%
uh had to agree to a total privacy
policy

01:10:29.110 --> 01:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
policy
 
01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:30.630 align:start position:0%
policy
and

01:10:30.630 --> 01:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:31.430 align:start position:0%
and
um

01:10:31.430 --> 01:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:35.590 --> 01:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
it hamstrung a lot of of
 
01:10:37.430 --> 01:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
new ideas innovative things that were
 
01:10:40.070 --> 01:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
going on in schools for example um i
 
01:10:41.910 --> 01:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
know at one of the schools that i was
 
01:10:44.790 --> 01:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
talking to they had a drafting online
 
01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:45.990 align:start position:0%
talking to they had a drafting online
drafting

01:10:45.990 --> 01:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
drafting
 
01:10:48.310 --> 01:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
that they no longer could use as long as
 
01:10:49.430 --> 01:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
that bill
 
01:10:52.070 --> 01:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
was in effect and that's the kind of
 
01:10:54.390 --> 01:10:54.400 align:start position:0%
thing where
 
01:10:57.189 --> 01:10:57.199 align:start position:0%
again speaking as a former teacher that
 
01:10:59.270 --> 01:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
that had to put up with all the
 
01:11:01.110 --> 01:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
regulations and had jumped through all
 
01:11:03.350 --> 01:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
the hoops
 
01:11:05.350 --> 01:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
and realizing that the charter schools
 
01:11:07.830 --> 01:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
don't have to do anything
 
01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
any of those hoops unless it's
 
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:16.149 --> 01:11:16.159 align:start position:0%
that if it's good for the goose it
 
01:11:18.229 --> 01:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
should be good for the gander that we
 
01:11:19.990 --> 01:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be putting
 
01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
more regulations more requirements
 
01:11:24.870 --> 01:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
more time
 
01:11:26.630 --> 01:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
if if it's just
 
01:11:28.229 --> 01:11:28.239 align:start position:0%
collecting data
 
01:11:30.310 --> 01:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
if we don't know why it's collected we
 
01:11:31.590 --> 01:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
01:11:33.510 --> 01:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
you know if it's to spark a discussion
 
01:11:36.070 --> 01:11:36.080 align:start position:0%
just ask them to have a discussion if if
 
01:11:37.830 --> 01:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
there's some purpose of collecting the
 
01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:40.470 align:start position:0%
there's some purpose of collecting the
data

01:11:40.470 --> 01:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:42.709 --> 01:11:42.719 align:start position:0%
and having it in a central location and
 
01:11:45.430 --> 01:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
it's never seen by anybody or never used
 
01:11:48.709 --> 01:11:48.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
what's the deal here it's it's a
 
01:11:52.709 --> 01:11:52.719 align:start position:0%
it's a non
 
01:11:55.669 --> 01:11:55.679 align:start position:0%
it's a no deal you know so those are the
 
01:11:58.470 --> 01:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
questions i want one answered um and
 
01:12:01.669 --> 01:12:01.679 align:start position:0%
again i'll just say time is money
 
01:12:03.189 --> 01:12:03.199 align:start position:0%
sure thank you representative tana and
 
01:12:04.870 --> 01:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
you mentioned regulations and i say
 
01:12:08.070 --> 01:12:08.080 align:start position:0%
again uh this bill uh this proposed
 
01:12:11.270 --> 01:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
measure uh has no regulations other than
 
01:12:13.110 --> 01:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
a reporting requirement to let us know
 
01:12:15.990 --> 01:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
what you already have
 
01:12:16.950 --> 01:12:16.960 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
01:12:19.189 --> 01:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
that's a requirement that's a regulation
 
01:12:20.950 --> 01:12:20.960 align:start position:0%
okay that's that's why we're putting it
 
01:12:23.669 --> 01:12:23.679 align:start position:0%
into statute is that yes
 
01:12:23.679 --> 01:12:24.550 align:start position:0%
into statute is that yes
okay

01:12:24.550 --> 01:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:12:27.669 --> 01:12:27.679 align:start position:0%
yes a reporting requirement ioc is a
 
01:12:30.310 --> 01:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
regulation i guess it's semantics uh
 
01:12:32.630 --> 01:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
i don't want more i don't want more we
 
01:12:34.390 --> 01:12:34.400 align:start position:0%
don't want more regulations if we can
 
01:12:36.790 --> 01:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
avoid that uh we just want to uh have
 
01:12:38.870 --> 01:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
people share public information the
 
01:12:41.669 --> 01:12:41.679 align:start position:0%
cordelia bill i i heard about when this
 
01:12:43.910 --> 01:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
first came up uh chairman ladd uh
 
01:12:46.229 --> 01:12:46.239 align:start position:0%
mentioned that the you know the cornell
 
01:12:47.669 --> 01:12:47.679 align:start position:0%
cordelia bill and all the trouble that
 
01:12:49.350 --> 01:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
you mentioned came out of that and
 
01:12:51.510 --> 01:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
that's what speaking for myself i don't
 
01:12:55.030 --> 01:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
want that corneli bell i don't want
 
01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:55.990 align:start position:0%
want that corneli bell i don't want
that

01:12:55.990 --> 01:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:12:57.910 --> 01:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
that flowed out of that that's what
 
01:13:01.030 --> 01:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
that's what this is about and finally
 
01:13:03.030 --> 01:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
uh the point about
 
01:13:08.149 --> 01:13:08.159 align:start position:0%
doe or the state school board or whoever
 
01:13:09.830 --> 01:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
putting a memo out and asking for the
 
01:13:11.990 --> 01:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
same information that's come up before
 
01:13:14.310 --> 01:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
and my answer to that that's a fair
 
01:13:15.669 --> 01:13:15.679 align:start position:0%
question you know why do we need a
 
01:13:19.669 --> 01:13:19.679 align:start position:0%
statute and my answer is
 
01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
the impermitor of
 
01:13:24.630 --> 01:13:24.640 align:start position:0%
uh statute the fact that the people's
 
01:13:27.189 --> 01:13:27.199 align:start position:0%
representatives thought that something
 
01:13:30.229 --> 01:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
was important enough to have a hear a
 
01:13:33.510 --> 01:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
hearing an exact session discussion and
 
01:13:35.189 --> 01:13:35.199 align:start position:0%
uh about a law
 
01:13:37.750 --> 01:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
that has some gravitas and that matters
 
01:13:40.390 --> 01:13:40.400 align:start position:0%
um not everybody loves the state school
 
01:13:42.310 --> 01:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
board people not everybody loves the
 
01:13:44.870 --> 01:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner believe it or not and if if
 
01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
the commissioner sends out and he said
 
01:13:48.070 --> 01:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
this uh
 
01:13:49.110 --> 01:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:13:51.189 --> 01:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
and diana can can
 
01:13:53.590 --> 01:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
in a moment or to uh
 
01:13:55.189 --> 01:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
speak to a lot of this
 
01:13:55.199 --> 01:13:56.390 align:start position:0%
speak to a lot of this
uh

01:13:56.390 --> 01:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:13:58.149 --> 01:13:58.159 align:start position:0%
the notion of having this accomplished
 
01:13:59.910 --> 01:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
by a memo
 
01:14:01.430 --> 01:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't cut it and didn't cut it and
 
01:14:03.590 --> 01:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
wouldn't cut it a lot of schools just
 
01:14:06.950 --> 01:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
are not responsive to memos from
 
01:14:10.229 --> 01:14:10.239 align:start position:0%
the doe but they have to be responsive
 
01:14:12.390 --> 01:14:12.400 align:start position:0%
if this isn't statute gifted is now in
 
01:14:14.390 --> 01:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
statute and people know that
 
01:14:17.669 --> 01:14:17.679 align:start position:0%
and so locally uh now people can come to
 
01:14:19.350 --> 01:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
their superintendent of the school board
 
01:14:22.310 --> 01:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
and say uh there's a lot that says you
 
01:14:24.470 --> 01:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
need to submit a report as to what you
 
01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:25.189 align:start position:0%
need to submit a report as to what you
do

01:14:25.189 --> 01:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:14:27.270 --> 01:14:27.280 align:start position:0%
for gifted uh are you following the law
 
01:14:29.270 --> 01:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
so that's the wrong answer but i think
 
01:14:31.270 --> 01:14:31.280 align:start position:0%
statute matters much more than the memo
 
01:14:33.510 --> 01:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
that's why you know we were looking
 
01:14:35.910 --> 01:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
using the statutory route rather than a
 
01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:36.870 align:start position:0%
using the statutory route rather than a
memo

01:14:36.870 --> 01:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
memo
 
01:14:40.149 --> 01:14:40.159 align:start position:0%
all right so so we've got um
 
01:14:42.310 --> 01:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
what eight of us around here we've spent
 
01:14:45.350 --> 01:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
almost an hour an hour and 15 minutes um
 
01:14:46.950 --> 01:14:46.960 align:start position:0%
on this on top of what's already been
 
01:14:50.870 --> 01:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:54.870 --> 01:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:54.880 --> 01:15:02.229 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:15:02.229 --> 01:15:02.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:04.870 --> 01:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
putting something into a law
 
01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:05.669 align:start position:0%
putting something into a law
um

01:15:05.669 --> 01:15:05.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:06.950 --> 01:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
whether it's a requirement or a
 
01:15:09.510 --> 01:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
regulation is this in my
 
01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:10.470 align:start position:0%
regulation is this in my
my

01:15:10.470 --> 01:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:15:13.030 --> 01:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
view is the same thing you don't you
 
01:15:14.950 --> 01:15:14.960 align:start position:0%
don't come down with a heavy hand of a
 
01:15:17.590 --> 01:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
law if what you're trying to what your
 
01:15:20.470 --> 01:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
intent truly is is just to have a
 
01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:21.830 align:start position:0%
intent truly is is just to have a
discussion

01:15:21.830 --> 01:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:15:24.950 --> 01:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
okay if that's what the intent is
 
01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:26.149 align:start position:0%
okay if that's what the intent is
then

01:15:26.149 --> 01:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:15:27.510 --> 01:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
you don't need a law you need a
 
01:15:30.390 --> 01:15:30.400 align:start position:0%
memorandum and you need people to
 
01:15:32.790 --> 01:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
actually at the state department who
 
01:15:35.110 --> 01:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
have specialties in this area for
 
01:15:37.590 --> 01:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
example the bureau of education
 
01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:39.030 align:start position:0%
example the bureau of education
opportunities

01:15:39.030 --> 01:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
opportunities
 
01:15:40.950 --> 01:15:40.960 align:start position:0%
to go around the schools and say look
 
01:15:42.310 --> 01:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
this is what
 
01:15:44.550 --> 01:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
a great gifted and talented program
 
01:15:47.430 --> 01:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
looks like this is what a great
 
01:15:50.390 --> 01:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
policy and you should have a policy i'm
 
01:15:52.470 --> 01:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
sure that the insurance companies primex
 
01:15:54.470 --> 01:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
and those insurance companies that uh
 
01:15:56.149 --> 01:15:56.159 align:start position:0%
ensure schools
 
01:15:57.830 --> 01:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
um have
 
01:15:59.830 --> 01:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
talked to them extensively
 
01:16:02.390 --> 01:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
about the risks of of videotaping and
 
01:16:04.149 --> 01:16:04.159 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing and and
 
01:16:06.709 --> 01:16:06.719 align:start position:0%
uh student privacy um
 
01:16:09.430 --> 01:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm almost positive um
 
01:16:11.030 --> 01:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
and and this just seems like an
 
01:16:14.630 --> 01:16:14.640 align:start position:0%
intrusion a heavy government intrusion
 
01:16:16.870 --> 01:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
into something that should be local
 
01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:17.990 align:start position:0%
into something that should be local
discussion

01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:16:20.149 --> 01:16:20.159 align:start position:0%
and if you're again if your intent is
 
01:16:24.390 --> 01:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
just a discussion then a memorandum um
 
01:16:27.430 --> 01:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
should do it and certainly uh
 
01:16:29.669 --> 01:16:29.679 align:start position:0%
information coming out i know when they
 
01:16:31.110 --> 01:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
used to have
 
01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:32.830 align:start position:0%
used to have
like

01:16:32.830 --> 01:16:32.840 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:16:35.750 --> 01:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
um you know a social studies coordinator
 
01:16:37.510 --> 01:16:37.520 align:start position:0%
or guidance coordinator at the
 
01:16:40.310 --> 01:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
department of education that person and
 
01:16:43.430 --> 01:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
that that particular department used to
 
01:16:46.790 --> 01:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
give out information to local schools
 
01:16:48.790 --> 01:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
and and people that were teaching or
 
01:16:50.630 --> 01:16:50.640 align:start position:0%
people that were guidance counselors
 
01:16:53.189 --> 01:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
about best practices what's going on
 
01:16:55.030 --> 01:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
what's really needed
 
01:16:58.229 --> 01:16:58.239 align:start position:0%
um and that in itself would spark
 
01:17:00.310 --> 01:17:00.320 align:start position:0%
um discussion
 
01:17:03.110 --> 01:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
um you know so
 
01:17:05.030 --> 01:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
i just think this is a heavy hand i
 
01:17:07.830 --> 01:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
think it's it's a big government
 
01:17:10.790 --> 01:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
idea i think it's i think it's um a
 
01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:12.229 align:start position:0%
idea i think it's i think it's um a
database

01:17:12.229 --> 01:17:12.239 align:start position:0%
database
 
01:17:14.709 --> 01:17:14.719 align:start position:0%
that's going nowhere unless we can find
 
01:17:14.719 --> 01:17:15.430 align:start position:0%
that's going nowhere unless we can find
out

01:17:15.430 --> 01:17:15.440 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:17:16.870 --> 01:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
who actually
 
01:17:18.630 --> 01:17:18.640 align:start position:0%
is using the data why they're using the
 
01:17:20.709 --> 01:17:20.719 align:start position:0%
data and have a copy of the survey
 
01:17:22.149 --> 01:17:22.159 align:start position:0%
that's going out
 
01:17:24.070 --> 01:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:17:27.350 --> 01:17:27.360 align:start position:0%

tanner i love all your comments
 
01:17:34.950 --> 01:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
first question is
 
01:17:37.189 --> 01:17:37.199 align:start position:0%
charter schools since charter schools
 
01:17:38.790 --> 01:17:38.800 align:start position:0%
are public schools would this apply to
 
01:17:40.070 --> 01:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
them as well
 
01:17:42.229 --> 01:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
and second
 
01:17:44.310 --> 01:17:44.320 align:start position:0%
i would love to hear from the doe it
 
01:17:46.149 --> 01:17:46.159 align:start position:0%
does not apply nothing applies to
 
01:17:48.630 --> 01:17:48.640 align:start position:0%
charter schools unless in the in the
 
01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:49.990 align:start position:0%
charter schools unless in the in the
specific

01:17:49.990 --> 01:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
specific
 
01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:51.110 align:start position:0%
specific
um

01:17:51.110 --> 01:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:52.149 align:start position:0%
um
law

01:17:52.149 --> 01:17:52.159 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:17:53.910 --> 01:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
that it says it applies to charter
 
01:17:55.750 --> 01:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
schools other than that they don't have
 
01:18:01.750 --> 01:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:03.750 --> 01:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative hobson and
 
01:18:06.070 --> 01:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
representative tanner
 
01:18:09.270 --> 01:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
before i ask d.o.e to to
 
01:18:12.550 --> 01:18:12.560 align:start position:0%
be available for questions
 
01:18:16.790 --> 01:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:19.030 --> 01:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
to represent luno's point about where
 
01:18:21.750 --> 01:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
we're gonna go this um i wanna let dear
 
01:18:24.310 --> 01:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
we have a chance to weigh in and um
 
01:18:26.229 --> 01:18:26.239 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:18:28.709 --> 01:18:28.719 align:start position:0%
to dave's question uh i've got a bunch
 
01:18:30.310 --> 01:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
of notes here so what i kind of
 
01:18:32.709 --> 01:18:32.719 align:start position:0%
anticipate is just
 
01:18:34.709 --> 01:18:34.719 align:start position:0%
um like the charter school issue that
 
01:18:36.790 --> 01:18:36.800 align:start position:0%
just came up i mean these are things
 
01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:37.750 align:start position:0%
just came up i mean these are things
that

01:18:37.750 --> 01:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:18:38.870 --> 01:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:18:41.030 --> 01:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
next year if something like this is
 
01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:42.149 align:start position:0%
next year if something like this is
introduced

01:18:42.149 --> 01:18:42.159 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
01:18:42.159 --> 01:18:43.030 align:start position:0%
introduced
uh

01:18:43.030 --> 01:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:18:44.149 --> 01:18:44.159 align:start position:0%
i think the
 
01:18:45.590 --> 01:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
language i think
 
01:18:47.430 --> 01:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
should address better
 
01:18:49.110 --> 01:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
uh questions that have been raised today
 
01:18:51.830 --> 01:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
like charter schools so that's kind of
 
01:18:54.229 --> 01:18:54.239 align:start position:0%
a quick answer to you but before i ask
 
01:18:56.310 --> 01:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
representative uh not representative or
 
01:18:59.510 --> 01:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
colonel or commissioner uh
 
01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:00.310 align:start position:0%
colonel or commissioner uh
uh

01:19:00.310 --> 01:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:19:02.070 --> 01:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
excellency uh
 
01:19:04.790 --> 01:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
attorney fenton um she's she's on her
 
01:19:12.870 --> 01:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:16.550 --> 01:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:17.990 --> 01:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
it's still technically morning good
 
01:19:20.149 --> 01:19:20.159 align:start position:0%
morning diana fenton from the department
 
01:19:22.630 --> 01:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
of representative tanner the survey
 
01:19:25.189 --> 01:19:25.199 align:start position:0%
questions are in your email
 
01:19:27.270 --> 01:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
they were written by nate green who's
 
01:19:29.669 --> 01:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
testified before this committee and so i
 
01:19:32.870 --> 01:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
just sent that email to you if you have
 
01:19:34.630 --> 01:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
sure send it to
 
01:19:37.110 --> 01:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
yeah of course um
 
01:19:38.790 --> 01:19:38.800 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to answer any questions that
 
01:19:40.149 --> 01:19:40.159 align:start position:0%
the committee might have it's nice to
 
01:19:50.229 --> 01:19:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:51.669 --> 01:19:51.679 align:start position:0%
sure i don't even know if i'm
 
01:19:54.229 --> 01:19:54.239 align:start position:0%
technically on this group um because i
 
01:19:56.790 --> 01:19:56.800 align:start position:0%
just showed up accidentally early so
 
01:19:59.990 --> 01:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
anyway i can beat representative saudi
 
01:20:02.550 --> 01:20:02.560 align:start position:0%
um can you tell can you tell me what the
 
01:20:06.470 --> 01:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
doe um would think about with a measure
 
01:20:07.590 --> 01:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
like this
 
01:20:09.990 --> 01:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
what what would it entail
 
01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.270 align:start position:0%
what what would it entail
um

01:20:11.270 --> 01:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:13.270 --> 01:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking you know if someone wanted
 
01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:14.709 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking you know if someone wanted
to

01:20:14.709 --> 01:20:14.719 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:20:16.790 --> 01:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
you know my constituents
 
01:20:19.110 --> 01:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
particularly wanted to know what were we
 
01:20:22.070 --> 01:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
doing with classroom recordings or you
 
01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:22.950 align:start position:0%
doing with classroom recordings or you
know

01:20:22.950 --> 01:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:20:24.950 --> 01:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
parent observations
 
01:20:26.550 --> 01:20:26.560 align:start position:0%
housing something like this what would
 
01:20:28.390 --> 01:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
that entail for you
 
01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
or for the doe
 
01:20:32.310 --> 01:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
have you thought about this you answers
 
01:20:33.990 --> 01:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
to some of our questions
 
01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:34.709 align:start position:0%
to some of our questions
uh

01:20:34.709 --> 01:20:34.719 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:20:37.590 --> 01:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
yeah to some of them i mean i think the
 
01:20:39.350 --> 01:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
we always take our
 
01:20:42.229 --> 01:20:42.239 align:start position:0%
guidance from the law as written right
 
01:20:43.510 --> 01:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
and then we
 
01:20:45.590 --> 01:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
we base it on that and we base it on our
 
01:20:47.510 --> 01:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
prior precedence of interpreting similar
 
01:20:49.590 --> 01:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
laws and so i think
 
01:20:51.669 --> 01:20:51.679 align:start position:0%
it would be reasonable to interpret it
 
01:20:54.229 --> 01:20:54.239 align:start position:0%
similar to the gifted and talented
 
01:20:56.070 --> 01:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
structure and there was a lot of
 
01:20:57.350 --> 01:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
discussion about that a couple of
 
01:20:59.189 --> 01:20:59.199 align:start position:0%
legislative sessions ago
 
01:21:01.910 --> 01:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
in terms of what would this look like um
 
01:21:03.990 --> 01:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
i believe that i testified that you know
 
01:21:06.470 --> 01:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
our concern was that it would be a file
 
01:21:08.470 --> 01:21:08.480 align:start position:0%
cabinet that would just sit there and so
 
01:21:10.310 --> 01:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
the idea was it would become a website
 
01:21:12.390 --> 01:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
it would be more interactive and that's
 
01:21:14.790 --> 01:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
how we have designed this um i think
 
01:21:17.510 --> 01:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
representative luna's point is
 
01:21:20.470 --> 01:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
is correct we just don't know
 
01:21:22.390 --> 01:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
how often this tool will be used we just
 
01:21:24.070 --> 01:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
don't have that information right now
 
01:21:27.430 --> 01:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
this has just been launched um but we
 
01:21:29.750 --> 01:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
had all those concerns that we've heard
 
01:21:31.910 --> 01:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
this morning with the gifted and
 
01:21:34.470 --> 01:21:34.480 align:start position:0%
talented bill just in terms of how much
 
01:21:36.950 --> 01:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
would this be utilized and accessed and
 
01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:38.149 align:start position:0%
would this be utilized and accessed and
um

01:21:38.149 --> 01:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:41.430 --> 01:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
and how much of doe times and staff
 
01:21:43.510 --> 01:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
would be put into it and so we have been
 
01:21:45.350 --> 01:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
able to fulfill
 
01:21:47.350 --> 01:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
the the requirements of that law i think
 
01:21:48.870 --> 01:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
pretty easily
 
01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:49.750 align:start position:0%
pretty easily
and

01:21:49.750 --> 01:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:21:52.550 --> 01:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
create this website and we will see how
 
01:21:54.870 --> 01:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
often that is utilized
 
01:21:56.709 --> 01:21:56.719 align:start position:0%
i would like to address representative
 
01:21:59.669 --> 01:21:59.679 align:start position:0%
luna's points um
 
01:22:02.390 --> 01:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
i off the top of my head i'm not sure
 
01:22:05.590 --> 01:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
which law talks about surveillance in in
 
01:22:07.030 --> 01:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
the school setting
 
01:22:09.669 --> 01:22:09.679 align:start position:0%
i know that it is addressed
 
01:22:12.149 --> 01:22:12.159 align:start position:0%
i would be surprised and this is just my
 
01:22:16.070 --> 01:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
own observation i would be surprised if
 
01:22:18.390 --> 01:22:18.400 align:start position:0%
schools don't have a policy some sort of
 
01:22:19.669 --> 01:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
policy on
 
01:22:21.350 --> 01:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
surveillance issues
 
01:22:24.149 --> 01:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
when it comes to school safety issues in
 
01:22:25.750 --> 01:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
01:22:27.750 --> 01:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
the homeland security concern which was
 
01:22:29.110 --> 01:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
brought up
 
01:22:31.030 --> 01:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
that law has been on the books for quite
 
01:22:35.270 --> 01:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:38.149 --> 01:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
more editorial rather than substantive
 
01:22:40.550 --> 01:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
and schools do have to turn in those
 
01:22:43.189 --> 01:22:43.199 align:start position:0%
blueprints to homeland security i
 
01:22:45.189 --> 01:22:45.199 align:start position:0%
believe that doe gets a copy of them as
 
01:22:46.709 --> 01:22:46.719 align:start position:0%
well but we've made it clear in our
 
01:22:49.270 --> 01:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
testimony and in the law that we are not
 
01:22:51.510 --> 01:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
first responders and we should not be
 
01:22:53.590 --> 01:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
looked at to have that information
 
01:22:56.390 --> 01:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
available in a crisis and we have put
 
01:22:58.390 --> 01:22:58.400 align:start position:0%
there's a provision in the law which
 
01:23:01.590 --> 01:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
excludes those blueprints from public
 
01:23:03.669 --> 01:23:03.679 align:start position:0%
consumption those are just private
 
01:23:08.310 --> 01:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:10.709 --> 01:23:10.719 align:start position:0%
if there was a concern about school
 
01:23:12.470 --> 01:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
safety which i certainly heard from
 
01:23:14.950 --> 01:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
representative luna i think you could
 
01:23:16.950 --> 01:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
tailor it
 
01:23:19.510 --> 01:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
similar to the blueprints
 
01:23:22.550 --> 01:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
that it is internal consumption only i
 
01:23:24.149 --> 01:23:24.159 align:start position:0%
don't know what that would look like to
 
01:23:26.070 --> 01:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
limit it only to the districts right now
 
01:23:27.910 --> 01:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
our website is open to the public as you
 
01:23:30.870 --> 01:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
all know um but that is
 
01:23:33.830 --> 01:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
potentially a way that we could address
 
01:23:35.350 --> 01:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
those concerns because i think they're
 
01:23:39.590 --> 01:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:41.030 --> 01:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
any other
 
01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:43.430 align:start position:0%
any other
questions

01:23:43.430 --> 01:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:23:44.450 --> 01:23:44.460 align:start position:0%
of course
 
01:23:44.460 --> 01:23:46.550 align:start position:0%
of course
[Laughter]

01:23:46.550 --> 01:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:23:48.629 --> 01:23:48.639 align:start position:0%
i am remiss that i did not bring my my
 
01:23:50.470 --> 01:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
law book
 
01:23:52.950 --> 01:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
um well hopefully we have those in the
 
01:23:56.070 --> 01:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
future um this does not apply to charter
 
01:23:58.950 --> 01:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
schools as it as it is written now um i
 
01:24:02.070 --> 01:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
had an amendment uh which was uh
 
01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:03.189 align:start position:0%
had an amendment uh which was uh
defeated

01:24:03.189 --> 01:24:03.199 align:start position:0%
defeated
 
01:24:03.199 --> 01:24:04.070 align:start position:0%
defeated
um

01:24:04.070 --> 01:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:05.830 --> 01:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
that would extend it to charter schools
 
01:24:07.910 --> 01:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
so as far as you know
 
01:24:11.110 --> 01:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
this isn't uh as it's written right now
 
01:24:13.030 --> 01:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply to charters or
 
01:24:17.510 --> 01:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
v-lacs is that true so i don't have the
 
01:24:18.870 --> 01:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
language of the statute in front of me i
 
01:24:20.709 --> 01:24:20.719 align:start position:0%
was looking at the ta
 
01:24:20.719 --> 01:24:21.590 align:start position:0%
was looking at the ta
so

01:24:21.590 --> 01:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:24:23.510 --> 01:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
just based on that i don't believe that
 
01:24:25.110 --> 01:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
this is applicable to charter schools
 
01:24:26.870 --> 01:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
but i can double check and get back to
 
01:24:28.790 --> 01:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
you but your understanding of the law is
 
01:24:30.870 --> 01:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
correct the charter school law makes
 
01:24:32.870 --> 01:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
very clear it has to be explicitly
 
01:24:35.669 --> 01:24:35.679 align:start position:0%
stated that any new law passed is
 
01:24:37.590 --> 01:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
applicable to charter schools
 
01:24:40.870 --> 01:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
and and prenda and kai and
 
01:24:43.430 --> 01:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
the other uh private agencies that are
 
01:24:45.590 --> 01:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
doing these internet um
 
01:24:47.030 --> 01:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
classrooms and
 
01:24:48.229 --> 01:24:48.239 align:start position:0%
all that they
 
01:24:50.950 --> 01:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
at this point are not submitting any
 
01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:52.310 align:start position:0%
at this point are not submitting any
um

01:24:52.310 --> 01:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:55.510 --> 01:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
any of this uh video or zoom
 
01:24:57.750 --> 01:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
or what they do with their recordings or
 
01:25:00.310 --> 01:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
how the video is done or anything like
 
01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:02.070 align:start position:0%
how the video is done or anything like
that

01:25:02.070 --> 01:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:25:05.510 --> 01:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
that you know not to my knowledge
 
01:25:07.830 --> 01:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
and and they wouldn't necessarily be
 
01:25:08.870 --> 01:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
under the
 
01:25:10.830 --> 01:25:10.840 align:start position:0%
statute as written right now unless
 
01:25:13.910 --> 01:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
expressly stated
 
01:25:16.229 --> 01:25:16.239 align:start position:0%
correct unless expressly stated but i
 
01:25:17.750 --> 01:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
also think it's important to look at the
 
01:25:20.149 --> 01:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
timeline this this particular law the
 
01:25:22.149 --> 01:25:22.159 align:start position:0%
gifted and talented bill
 
01:25:23.270 --> 01:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
had been
 
01:25:25.270 --> 01:25:25.280 align:start position:0%
worked on quite a bit and it was passed
 
01:25:26.870 --> 01:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
i think in the in the
 
01:25:28.550 --> 01:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
session when we're all remote due to the
 
01:25:31.350 --> 01:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
pandemic and now it's become effective
 
01:25:33.590 --> 01:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
and so i think some of the programs that
 
01:25:35.669 --> 01:25:35.679 align:start position:0%
you have mentioned were on that same
 
01:25:35.679 --> 01:25:37.030 align:start position:0%
you have mentioned were on that same
timeline

01:25:37.030 --> 01:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
timeline
 
01:25:39.669 --> 01:25:39.679 align:start position:0%
so as that bill was passed it would not
 
01:25:41.590 --> 01:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily have been thought of to
 
01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:43.270 align:start position:0%
necessarily have been thought of to
incorporate

01:25:43.270 --> 01:25:43.280 align:start position:0%
incorporate
 
01:25:45.510 --> 01:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
efas and and prenda because they were
 
01:25:47.270 --> 01:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
all on a similar timeline that's just
 
01:25:49.750 --> 01:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
based on my recollection
 
01:25:51.430 --> 01:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
and so it's just important to look at
 
01:25:53.590 --> 01:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
when different things were passed and
 
01:25:55.189 --> 01:25:55.199 align:start position:0%
could you just speak a little bit to the
 
01:25:57.430 --> 01:25:57.440 align:start position:0%
difference between if all you want is a
 
01:25:57.440 --> 01:25:58.629 align:start position:0%
difference between if all you want is a
discussion

01:25:58.629 --> 01:25:58.639 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:26:00.629 --> 01:26:00.639 align:start position:0%
uh sending out a memorandum rather than
 
01:26:04.950 --> 01:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:05.830 --> 01:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
could you
 
01:26:07.270 --> 01:26:07.280 align:start position:0%
i think i know what you're asking about
 
01:26:09.270 --> 01:26:09.280 align:start position:0%
but could you clarify that a little bit
 
01:26:13.030 --> 01:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
sure so if our intent in having this
 
01:26:14.709 --> 01:26:14.719 align:start position:0%
bill and also the gifted and talented
 
01:26:14.719 --> 01:26:15.510 align:start position:0%
bill and also the gifted and talented
bill

01:26:15.510 --> 01:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:26:17.189 --> 01:26:17.199 align:start position:0%
is simply to
 
01:26:20.149 --> 01:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
encourage discussion
 
01:26:22.709 --> 01:26:22.719 align:start position:0%
within schools about it
 
01:26:27.350 --> 01:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:29.590 --> 01:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
do you feel
 
01:26:30.709 --> 01:26:30.719 align:start position:0%
what is the
 
01:26:32.709 --> 01:26:32.719 align:start position:0%
discrepancy between just putting out a
 
01:26:34.709 --> 01:26:34.719 align:start position:0%
memorandum to that
 
01:26:37.350 --> 01:26:37.360 align:start position:0%
instance and providing information
 
01:26:39.990 --> 01:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
to schools and encouraging schools
 
01:26:43.510 --> 01:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
versus putting something in the statutes
 
01:26:45.270 --> 01:26:45.280 align:start position:0%
i think in its simplest form one is a
 
01:26:48.149 --> 01:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
mandate and one is a suggestion
 
01:26:52.950 --> 01:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
so this is a mandate or regulation in
 
01:26:54.229 --> 01:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
a loose
 
01:26:58.950 --> 01:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:00.229 --> 01:27:00.239 align:start position:0%
i think you've already answered that
 
01:27:02.790 --> 01:27:02.800 align:start position:0%
question but yes i mean if
 
01:27:05.189 --> 01:27:05.199 align:start position:0%
obviously the department can put out a
 
01:27:05.199 --> 01:27:06.390 align:start position:0%
obviously the department can put out a
request

01:27:06.390 --> 01:27:06.400 align:start position:0%
request
 
01:27:09.030 --> 01:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
issue a technical advisory and request
 
01:27:11.669 --> 01:27:11.679 align:start position:0%
that this information be submitted and
 
01:27:13.590 --> 01:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
in large part i think districts are very
 
01:27:16.229 --> 01:27:16.239 align:start position:0%
responsive um
 
01:27:18.070 --> 01:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
i think the department has very good
 
01:27:19.830 --> 01:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
working relationships with with
 
01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:22.070 align:start position:0%
working relationships with with
districts

01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
districts
 
01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:23.270 align:start position:0%
districts
however

01:27:23.270 --> 01:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:27:26.070 --> 01:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
if the legislature passes a bill which
 
01:27:27.910 --> 01:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
makes it a requirement
 
01:27:29.270 --> 01:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
then there will be
 
01:27:31.990 --> 01:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
uh not only will that be messaged to the
 
01:27:34.310 --> 01:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
districts that this is now a requirement
 
01:27:36.950 --> 01:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
but logically there will be required
 
01:27:38.950 --> 01:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
follow-up by the department to reach out
 
01:27:40.470 --> 01:27:40.480 align:start position:0%
to districts that might not have
 
01:27:42.790 --> 01:27:42.800 align:start position:0%
submitted those documents and and that i
 
01:27:44.790 --> 01:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
think is an important consideration for
 
01:27:46.950 --> 01:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
this legislative body is that and that's
 
01:27:48.790 --> 01:27:48.800 align:start position:0%
across the board not just talking about
 
01:27:51.590 --> 01:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
this particular bill but any requirement
 
01:27:54.470 --> 01:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
whether data any kind of data collection
 
01:27:57.350 --> 01:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
um the department does spend uh
 
01:28:00.149 --> 01:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
time i can't quantify how much just
 
01:28:01.990 --> 01:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
doing that follow-up and reaching out to
 
01:28:03.910 --> 01:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
districts and reminding them to to
 
01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:05.270 align:start position:0%
districts and reminding them to to
submit

01:28:05.270 --> 01:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
submit
 
01:28:06.709 --> 01:28:06.719 align:start position:0%
one thing that jumps to the top of my
 
01:28:08.709 --> 01:28:08.719 align:start position:0%
head is the restraint and seclusion
 
01:28:11.510 --> 01:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
report every year 126u
 
01:28:13.270 --> 01:28:13.280 align:start position:0%
that is a requirement every november the
 
01:28:16.149 --> 01:28:16.159 align:start position:0%
department produces a report that looks
 
01:28:18.870 --> 01:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
at the restraint seclusion numbers from
 
01:28:20.790 --> 01:28:20.800 align:start position:0%
all the districts i know you're going to
 
01:28:22.550 --> 01:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
ask about charter schools and yes i
 
01:28:25.590 --> 01:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
think they are included in them
 
01:28:27.110 --> 01:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
and that report is turned over to the
 
01:28:29.030 --> 01:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
legislature but i can tell you from
 
01:28:31.669 --> 01:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
personal experience we do have to every
 
01:28:33.910 --> 01:28:33.920 align:start position:0%
year spend time
 
01:28:36.229 --> 01:28:36.239 align:start position:0%
reaching out to certain districts which
 
01:28:38.070 --> 01:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
have not submitted for whatever reason
 
01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:39.430 align:start position:0%
have not submitted for whatever reason
it's

01:28:39.430 --> 01:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:28:41.350 --> 01:28:41.360 align:start position:0%
not their fault just other things come
 
01:28:43.669 --> 01:28:43.679 align:start position:0%
up um so i think that's just important
 
01:28:45.430 --> 01:28:45.440 align:start position:0%
to keep in mind this is always going to
 
01:28:46.550 --> 01:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
be that
 
01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:47.590 align:start position:0%
be that
uh

01:28:47.590 --> 01:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:28:49.750 --> 01:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
staff necessity as i call it
 
01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:50.550 align:start position:0%
staff necessity as i call it
for

01:28:50.550 --> 01:28:50.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:28:52.550 --> 01:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
for the follow-up and that would be
 
01:28:54.709 --> 01:28:54.719 align:start position:0%
different than if it was just
 
01:28:56.390 --> 01:28:56.400 align:start position:0%
a request
 
01:28:59.830 --> 01:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
so if i was if i was a
 
01:29:02.310 --> 01:29:02.320 align:start position:0%
concerned parent or maybe not even a
 
01:29:04.709 --> 01:29:04.719 align:start position:0%
parent just a concerned citizen in a
 
01:29:06.229 --> 01:29:06.239 align:start position:0%
school district
 
01:29:06.239 --> 01:29:07.030 align:start position:0%
school district
um

01:29:07.030 --> 01:29:07.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:09.510 --> 01:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
that will that data be available to me
 
01:29:12.709 --> 01:29:12.719 align:start position:0%
can i file a 91a on that
 
01:29:14.629 --> 01:29:14.639 align:start position:0%
or whatever it is called where they have
 
01:29:15.990 --> 01:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
to release
 
01:29:17.430 --> 01:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
data can
 
01:29:20.390 --> 01:29:20.400 align:start position:0%
specific to my school district
 
01:29:22.870 --> 01:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
so in general information that is on our
 
01:29:25.189 --> 01:29:25.199 align:start position:0%
website is for public consumption and so
 
01:29:26.950 --> 01:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
if you file a right to know and the
 
01:29:29.830 --> 01:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
information is available so for example
 
01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:30.709 align:start position:0%
information is available so for example
the

01:29:30.709 --> 01:29:30.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:29:33.110 --> 01:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
gifted and talented information is my
 
01:29:34.550 --> 01:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
understanding is
 
01:29:36.310 --> 01:29:36.320 align:start position:0%
publicly available or
 
01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:37.430 align:start position:0%
publicly available or
accessible

01:29:37.430 --> 01:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
accessible
 
01:29:40.709 --> 01:29:40.719 align:start position:0%
um it would be right there
 
01:29:44.070 --> 01:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
the 91a would be early
 
01:29:46.229 --> 01:29:46.239 align:start position:0%
we had mentioned the blueprints the
 
01:29:49.270 --> 01:29:49.280 align:start position:0%
emergency safety plans those are not to
 
01:29:51.669 --> 01:29:51.679 align:start position:0%
be released
 
01:29:53.910 --> 01:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
this legislative body could
 
01:29:56.709 --> 01:29:56.719 align:start position:0%
in theory craft something so that the
 
01:29:58.310 --> 01:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
information you are discussing
 
01:30:00.470 --> 01:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
surveillance recording things of that
 
01:30:00.480 --> 01:30:01.830 align:start position:0%
surveillance recording things of that
nature

01:30:01.830 --> 01:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
nature
 
01:30:04.229 --> 01:30:04.239 align:start position:0%
is not to be released
 
01:30:06.950 --> 01:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
um and just one last question uh so you
 
01:30:08.790 --> 01:30:08.800 align:start position:0%
say that the this
 
01:30:10.629 --> 01:30:10.639 align:start position:0%
there is staff time
 
01:30:13.030 --> 01:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
taken to follow up on the staff time to
 
01:30:15.830 --> 01:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
accumulate them um and i've been
 
01:30:17.910 --> 01:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
hammering about how time is money on the
 
01:30:20.229 --> 01:30:20.239 align:start position:0%
school side of it but time is money at
 
01:30:23.669 --> 01:30:23.679 align:start position:0%
the state department of education's um
 
01:30:25.830 --> 01:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
side of it as well
 
01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:26.870 align:start position:0%
side of it as well
and

01:30:26.870 --> 01:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:27.750 align:start position:0%
and
so

01:30:27.750 --> 01:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:30:29.830 --> 01:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we often
 
01:30:31.430 --> 01:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
we've heard in the past is that the
 
01:30:33.750 --> 01:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
01:30:36.390 --> 01:30:36.400 align:start position:0%
is short staffed or you know that that
 
01:30:38.310 --> 01:30:38.320 align:start position:0%
you're overburdened and i'm just
 
01:30:40.709 --> 01:30:40.719 align:start position:0%
wondering if if this is one more burden
 
01:30:46.390 --> 01:30:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:47.990 --> 01:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
well that's a bit of a tricky question
 
01:30:49.189 --> 01:30:49.199 align:start position:0%
the department
 
01:30:49.199 --> 01:30:50.950 align:start position:0%
the department
um

01:30:50.950 --> 01:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:52.629 --> 01:30:52.639 align:start position:0%
one of our many roles is to be
 
01:30:54.390 --> 01:30:54.400 align:start position:0%
responsive to the legislation that is
 
01:30:54.400 --> 01:30:55.510 align:start position:0%
responsive to the legislation that is
passed

01:30:55.510 --> 01:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
passed
 
01:30:55.520 --> 01:30:57.030 align:start position:0%
passed
and

01:30:57.030 --> 01:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:30:59.110 --> 01:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
if the legislature feels that this is an
 
01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:00.550 align:start position:0%
if the legislature feels that this is an
important

01:31:00.550 --> 01:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:31:02.629 --> 01:31:02.639 align:start position:0%
measure to bring forward the department
 
01:31:05.669 --> 01:31:05.679 align:start position:0%
will be responsive to it does it take up
 
01:31:08.709 --> 01:31:08.719 align:start position:0%
does it require staff time yes it does
 
01:31:08.719 --> 01:31:09.510 align:start position:0%
does it require staff time yes it does
um

01:31:09.510 --> 01:31:09.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:11.110 --> 01:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
but this is not the only measure that
 
01:31:13.590 --> 01:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
would require staff time to create and
 
01:31:15.669 --> 01:31:15.679 align:start position:0%
implement and and follow up on as i
 
01:31:17.350 --> 01:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned the the restraints occlusion
 
01:31:18.950 --> 01:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
reports as well so
 
01:31:21.350 --> 01:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
um that's not a consideration that the
 
01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:22.629 align:start position:0%
um that's not a consideration that the
department

01:31:22.629 --> 01:31:22.639 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:31:24.790 --> 01:31:24.800 align:start position:0%
does in its analysis because we are
 
01:31:27.110 --> 01:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
responsive to the laws that are passed
 
01:31:28.709 --> 01:31:28.719 align:start position:0%
so i think that is more i'm going to
 
01:31:31.590 --> 01:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
defer that back to this legislative body
 
01:31:33.910 --> 01:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
to to make that recommendation and the
 
01:31:36.709 --> 01:31:36.719 align:start position:0%
department will respond in
 
01:31:39.590 --> 01:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:41.830 --> 01:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
thank you attorney i know it's known and
 
01:31:44.550 --> 01:31:44.560 align:start position:0%
you indicated at noon noontime but
 
01:31:46.550 --> 01:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
i'm what i'm hearing from you though is
 
01:31:50.310 --> 01:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
that the response to a memo oftentimes
 
01:31:52.310 --> 01:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
is not what you'd like it to be is that
 
01:31:54.229 --> 01:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
fair to say
 
01:31:59.910 --> 01:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:01.590 --> 01:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
there's no way to ensure that you will
 
01:32:04.470 --> 01:32:04.480 align:start position:0%
get the consistency the request goes out
 
01:32:04.480 --> 01:32:05.990 align:start position:0%
get the consistency the request goes out
and

01:32:05.990 --> 01:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:32:08.550 --> 01:32:08.560 align:start position:0%
i don't know how much the department
 
01:32:08.560 --> 01:32:09.910 align:start position:0%
i don't know how much the department
would

01:32:09.910 --> 01:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:32:12.709 --> 01:32:12.719 align:start position:0%
invest in doing that follow-up we
 
01:32:15.669 --> 01:32:15.679 align:start position:0%
the interpretation by the department
 
01:32:17.110 --> 01:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
would be different
 
01:32:20.550 --> 01:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
if it was a shall do this rather than a
 
01:32:21.350 --> 01:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:32:23.350 --> 01:32:23.360 align:start position:0%
may send out
 
01:32:25.830 --> 01:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
a ta requesting this information i think
 
01:32:27.189 --> 01:32:27.199 align:start position:0%
the response from the department would
 
01:32:28.629 --> 01:32:28.639 align:start position:0%
be um
 
01:32:32.870 --> 01:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:34.470 --> 01:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
cross-examination and assessment the
 
01:32:36.870 --> 01:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
right term uh
 
01:32:38.310 --> 01:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
just a quick question so i just want to
 
01:32:40.790 --> 01:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
be clear that the doe's role
 
01:32:42.790 --> 01:32:42.800 align:start position:0%
is solely
 
01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:43.910 align:start position:0%
is solely
clerical

01:32:43.910 --> 01:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
clerical
 
01:32:43.920 --> 01:32:44.950 align:start position:0%
clerical
period

01:32:44.950 --> 01:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
period
 
01:32:46.709 --> 01:32:46.719 align:start position:0%
the doe is not going to look at these
 
01:32:48.310 --> 01:32:48.320 align:start position:0%
policies to say whoa look what this
 
01:32:50.629 --> 01:32:50.639 align:start position:0%
one's got and what it's solely to throw
 
01:32:58.229 --> 01:32:58.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:59.350 --> 01:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
and maybe
 
01:33:01.750 --> 01:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
track the data track who's visiting that
 
01:33:03.350 --> 01:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
who's opening that folder because i
 
01:33:04.790 --> 01:33:04.800 align:start position:0%
think that that's really important to
 
01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:05.590 align:start position:0%
think that that's really important to
know

01:33:05.590 --> 01:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:33:07.910 --> 01:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
but i'm going to answer your question
 
01:33:09.830 --> 01:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
globally and then i will kind of drill
 
01:33:15.270 --> 01:33:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:17.270 --> 01:33:17.280 align:start position:0%
one of the overarching concerns not just
 
01:33:18.790 --> 01:33:18.800 align:start position:0%
on this legislation but all the
 
01:33:21.189 --> 01:33:21.199 align:start position:0%
legislation uh every session the
 
01:33:22.390 --> 01:33:22.400 align:start position:0%
question from the department's
 
01:33:25.030 --> 01:33:25.040 align:start position:0%
perspective is always what is the
 
01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:26.550 align:start position:0%
perspective is always what is the
expectation

01:33:26.550 --> 01:33:26.560 align:start position:0%
expectation
 
01:33:27.910 --> 01:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
of the department what is the
 
01:33:29.750 --> 01:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
requirement of the department because
 
01:33:32.149 --> 01:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
historically what we have seen our bills
 
01:33:34.229 --> 01:33:34.239 align:start position:0%
are passed and then we fast forward two
 
01:33:36.229 --> 01:33:36.239 align:start position:0%
three four five years and then someone
 
01:33:37.750 --> 01:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
says yeah what has the department done
 
01:33:39.750 --> 01:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
with with this law what has the
 
01:33:41.030 --> 01:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
department done was with this
 
01:33:42.870 --> 01:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
information and there have been times
 
01:33:45.350 --> 01:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
where i have sat before you and said
 
01:33:48.470 --> 01:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
very coherently with my law degree uh i
 
01:33:51.110 --> 01:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
don't know or my other favorite uh
 
01:33:51.120 --> 01:33:52.550 align:start position:0%
don't know or my other favorite uh
nothing

01:33:52.550 --> 01:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
01:33:55.110 --> 01:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
and that is just a reality we've all
 
01:33:56.790 --> 01:33:56.800 align:start position:0%
seen that
 
01:33:59.189 --> 01:33:59.199 align:start position:0%
and so when the gifted and talented bill
 
01:34:01.110 --> 01:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
came up i remember having conversations
 
01:34:03.350 --> 01:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
with representative moffat to say
 
01:34:05.189 --> 01:34:05.199 align:start position:0%
what is the expectation on the
 
01:34:08.470 --> 01:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
department because we can collect
 
01:34:10.310 --> 01:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
any document this legislature wants us
 
01:34:12.629 --> 01:34:12.639 align:start position:0%
to collect but in terms of being good
 
01:34:15.350 --> 01:34:15.360 align:start position:0%
stewards of state dollars state time
 
01:34:17.910 --> 01:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
state resources what is the end result
 
01:34:19.669 --> 01:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
what is the expectation that the
 
01:34:22.709 --> 01:34:22.719 align:start position:0%
department will do so to drill down to
 
01:34:25.990 --> 01:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:28.229 --> 01:34:28.239 align:start position:0%
we will read these policies we're not
 
01:34:28.239 --> 01:34:29.270 align:start position:0%
we will read these policies we're not
just

01:34:29.270 --> 01:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:34:31.270 --> 01:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
blindly putting them in there but we are
 
01:34:33.990 --> 01:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
not in a position to weigh in on them
 
01:34:35.189 --> 01:34:35.199 align:start position:0%
and to say
 
01:34:37.350 --> 01:34:37.360 align:start position:0%
oh this is good policy
 
01:34:39.430 --> 01:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
this doesn't seem like a good policy you
 
01:34:42.310 --> 01:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
wouldn't do that kind of analysis
 
01:34:44.629 --> 01:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
the objective of the law has passed the
 
01:34:47.430 --> 01:34:47.440 align:start position:0%
gifted and talented bill was to have it
 
01:34:50.470 --> 01:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
be a warehouse if you will um where
 
01:34:53.189 --> 01:34:53.199 align:start position:0%
people can go and and look for best
 
01:34:55.350 --> 01:34:55.360 align:start position:0%
practices that was the understanding
 
01:34:56.709 --> 01:34:56.719 align:start position:0%
from the department's perspective and
 
01:34:59.830 --> 01:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
that is what was then created
 
01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:01.669 align:start position:0%
that is what was then created
so

01:35:01.669 --> 01:35:01.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:35:03.590 --> 01:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
yes the department will likely look at
 
01:35:05.510 --> 01:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
them and read them just to see what's
 
01:35:07.350 --> 01:35:07.360 align:start position:0%
being submitted
 
01:35:09.350 --> 01:35:09.360 align:start position:0%
but we're not going and doing any
 
01:35:11.830 --> 01:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
analysis or saying hey this we're going
 
01:35:13.590 --> 01:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
to send this out as a best practice or
 
01:35:15.750 --> 01:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
we really think that i'll pick on my old
 
01:35:17.109 --> 01:35:17.119 align:start position:0%
high school kenneth high school has a
 
01:35:18.870 --> 01:35:18.880 align:start position:0%
really good policy we're going to send
 
01:35:21.270 --> 01:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
this out and be preemptive and say
 
01:35:24.550 --> 01:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
everyone should adopt this policy
 
01:35:26.470 --> 01:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
we have always deferred to local control
 
01:35:29.990 --> 01:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
and the idea was this is something that
 
01:35:32.709 --> 01:35:32.719 align:start position:0%
depart districts can reach out and look
 
01:35:35.590 --> 01:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
at and make that their own determination
 
01:35:36.790 --> 01:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
and i don't think there was ever any
 
01:35:38.310 --> 01:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
intent that the department would weigh
 
01:35:41.590 --> 01:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
in and have that say
 
01:35:43.910 --> 01:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
good question representing the fall and
 
01:35:46.310 --> 01:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
a good answer i i think
 
01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:47.270 align:start position:0%
a good answer i i think
uh

01:35:47.270 --> 01:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:35:49.030 --> 01:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
last carl i know it's a little bit
 
01:35:51.430 --> 01:35:51.440 align:start position:0%

thank you so much for being here we have

be around for that
 
01:36:01.590 --> 01:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
look i'm going to try
 
01:36:03.430 --> 01:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
uh since i'm already late for my noon
 
01:36:05.350 --> 01:36:05.360 align:start position:0%
why not
 
01:36:07.510 --> 01:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
all right thank you for your time i will
 
01:36:10.229 --> 01:36:10.239 align:start position:0%
actually get to you i i was bloviating
 
01:36:13.189 --> 01:36:13.199 align:start position:0%
i'm sure that slowly cleansed up uh okay
 
01:36:14.870 --> 01:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh russell roano would ask about the
 
01:36:17.669 --> 01:36:17.679 align:start position:0%
purposes so uh really where we go from
 
01:36:17.679 --> 01:36:18.709 align:start position:0%
purposes so uh really where we go from
here

01:36:18.709 --> 01:36:18.719 align:start position:0%

01:36:50.550 --> 01:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
add on any anything that
 
01:36:52.070 --> 01:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
my notes might have missed that you
 
01:36:55.030 --> 01:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
think is saline or relevant or should be
 
01:36:57.590 --> 01:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
part of a little report from our work
 
01:36:57.600 --> 01:36:58.709 align:start position:0%
part of a little report from our work
session

01:36:58.709 --> 01:36:58.719 align:start position:0%
session
 
01:36:58.719 --> 01:36:59.590 align:start position:0%
session
um

01:36:59.590 --> 01:36:59.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:01.189 --> 01:37:01.199 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
01:37:03.030 --> 01:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
i don't necessarily see a need to try to
 
01:37:05.270 --> 01:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
squeeze in another meeting before july
 
01:37:08.310 --> 01:37:08.320 align:start position:0%
or necessarily even in september
 
01:37:10.229 --> 01:37:10.239 align:start position:0%
we had a hearing an exec session we
 
01:37:13.030 --> 01:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
talked a lot today about concerns and
 
01:37:15.910 --> 01:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
aspects of this
 
01:37:18.790 --> 01:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
does anybody want to try to have another
 
01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:21.669 align:start position:0%
does anybody want to try to have another
session

01:37:21.669 --> 01:37:21.679 align:start position:0%
session
 
01:37:23.189 --> 01:37:23.199 align:start position:0%
i'm seeing representative cornell
 
01:37:25.590 --> 01:37:25.600 align:start position:0%
shaking her head in the negative
 
01:37:28.310 --> 01:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
i'm kind of there too uh but i i don't
 
01:37:29.590 --> 01:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
want to
 
01:37:31.910 --> 01:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
so okay so what i'll do dave is i'll uh
 
01:37:33.750 --> 01:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
work some notes up them with you all you
 
01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:34.629 align:start position:0%
work some notes up them with you all you
can

01:37:34.629 --> 01:37:34.639 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:37:38.070 --> 01:37:38.080 align:start position:0%
edit add whatever and then once we all
 
01:37:39.590 --> 01:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
have everything on there that we think
 
01:37:41.350 --> 01:37:41.360 align:start position:0%
should be included i'll send it to the
 
01:37:44.070 --> 01:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
chair and the whole committee and um
 
01:37:46.390 --> 01:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
and then this uh
 
01:37:48.870 --> 01:37:48.880 align:start position:0%
as far as a recommendation i guess uh
 
01:37:51.189 --> 01:37:51.199 align:start position:0%
i'll put this
 
01:37:54.950 --> 01:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
in my notes um if this were to come back
 
01:37:57.189 --> 01:37:57.199 align:start position:0%
in a future session uh here are the
 
01:37:57.199 --> 01:37:58.470 align:start position:0%
in a future session uh here are the
concerns

01:37:58.470 --> 01:37:58.480 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
01:38:00.310 --> 01:38:00.320 align:start position:0%
and the pieces of it that we've
 
01:38:02.310 --> 01:38:02.320 align:start position:0%
identified that need to be worded better
 
01:38:04.310 --> 01:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
or differently if if this ever comes
 
01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:05.590 align:start position:0%
or differently if if this ever comes
back

01:38:05.590 --> 01:38:05.600 align:start position:0%
back
 
01:38:08.070 --> 01:38:08.080 align:start position:0%
so um is the um is the interim study
 
01:38:09.910 --> 01:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
committee going to take a a vote on a
 
01:38:09.920 --> 01:38:13.430 align:start position:0%
committee going to take a a vote on a
recommendation

01:38:13.430 --> 01:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:15.510 --> 01:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
good question i don't have a motion to
 
01:38:17.910 --> 01:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
make other than what i just said um i
 
01:38:20.470 --> 01:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
want to i'd make a motion to well i
 
01:38:21.910 --> 01:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
can't make a motion because i'm not on
 
01:38:23.750 --> 01:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:38:25.830 --> 01:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
i would like to make a motion that that
 
01:38:25.840 --> 01:38:27.109 align:start position:0%
i would like to make a motion that that
uh

01:38:27.109 --> 01:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:38:29.270 --> 01:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
the vote um
 
01:38:29.280 --> 01:38:31.030 align:start position:0%
the vote um
we

01:38:31.030 --> 01:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:38:33.350 --> 01:38:33.360 align:start position:0%
yeah not recommended this for
 
01:38:36.229 --> 01:38:36.239 align:start position:0%
future legislation
 
01:38:37.669 --> 01:38:37.679 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
01:38:40.229 --> 01:38:40.239 align:start position:0%
as to that motion i'm reticent to have a
 
01:38:42.149 --> 01:38:42.159 align:start position:0%
vote on this because
 
01:38:44.149 --> 01:38:44.159 align:start position:0%
uh several of the people that the chair
 
01:38:47.189 --> 01:38:47.199 align:start position:0%
assigned to be here uh could not be here
 
01:38:49.030 --> 01:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
representative lekkis was assigned and
 
01:38:50.709 --> 01:38:50.719 align:start position:0%
she's out of state representative saudi
 
01:38:52.870 --> 01:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
was assigned so to be fair to those
 
01:38:54.709 --> 01:38:54.719 align:start position:0%
folks who were assigned to the committee
 
01:38:57.350 --> 01:38:57.360 align:start position:0%
and weren't able to be here uh i i don't
 
01:39:01.750 --> 01:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
want to you know disenfranchise them um
 
01:39:04.790 --> 01:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
or we could schedule another meeting
 
01:39:06.229 --> 01:39:06.239 align:start position:0%
right correct
 
01:39:06.239 --> 01:39:07.189 align:start position:0%
right correct
uh

01:39:07.189 --> 01:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:39:10.310 --> 01:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
and my feeling and we can you know we we
 
01:39:11.910 --> 01:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
would have if we have another meeting
 
01:39:13.990 --> 01:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
that could involve them would need to be
 
01:39:16.629 --> 01:39:16.639 align:start position:0%
in july it's that's kind of
 
01:39:18.709 --> 01:39:18.719 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i meant to say joan i meant to
 
01:39:20.950 --> 01:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
say june and i we're kind of running out
 
01:39:22.870 --> 01:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
of time we could try to do that or we
 
01:39:25.430 --> 01:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
could try to do something in september
 
01:39:28.790 --> 01:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
so i don't see us having a vote um
 
01:39:32.070 --> 01:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
for the reasons i just gave
 
01:39:33.990 --> 01:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
so again what i will do as i said is
 
01:39:36.470 --> 01:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
i'll organize the notes from this first
 
01:39:38.149 --> 01:39:38.159 align:start position:0%
work session send it to everybody for
 
01:39:39.350 --> 01:39:39.360 align:start position:0%
your review
 
01:39:41.270 --> 01:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
and then um
 
01:39:44.070 --> 01:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
we can meet again in september
 
01:39:46.149 --> 01:39:46.159 align:start position:0%
uh if uh
 
01:39:48.149 --> 01:39:48.159 align:start position:0%
if the chair recommends that
 
01:39:49.270 --> 01:39:49.280 align:start position:0%
and we don't have to make a
 
01:39:51.510 --> 01:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
recommendation does it
 
01:39:54.390 --> 01:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
sure excuse me doesn't in the past when
 
01:39:56.310 --> 01:39:56.320 align:start position:0%
i've been on these interim study
 
01:39:58.070 --> 01:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
committees that we usually
 
01:40:00.790 --> 01:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
have a vote have a have a statement
 
01:40:03.270 --> 01:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
that's given to the full committee then
 
01:40:05.109 --> 01:40:05.119 align:start position:0%
the full committee meets in september
 
01:40:06.629 --> 01:40:06.639 align:start position:0%
and just goes through them
 
01:40:08.870 --> 01:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
after that they received the report and
 
01:40:10.709 --> 01:40:10.719 align:start position:0%
make the final decision from there
 
01:40:12.950 --> 01:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
that's our vote
 
01:40:14.470 --> 01:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
right our vote
 
01:40:15.590 --> 01:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
sure i mean that's what happened with
 
01:40:17.669 --> 01:40:17.679 align:start position:0%
the gifted bill originally as as i said
 
01:40:20.310 --> 01:40:20.320 align:start position:0%
a couple times also the unified sports
 
01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:21.270 align:start position:0%
a couple times also the unified sports
uh

01:40:21.270 --> 01:40:21.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:22.550 align:start position:0%
uh
so

01:40:22.550 --> 01:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:23.350 align:start position:0%
so
i

01:40:23.350 --> 01:40:23.360 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:24.629 align:start position:0%
i
guess

01:40:24.629 --> 01:40:24.639 align:start position:0%
guess
 
01:40:26.950 --> 01:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
what will happen is as i said i'll
 
01:40:29.910 --> 01:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
organize the notes from this session
 
01:40:31.350 --> 01:40:31.360 align:start position:0%
send them to the chair with the
 
01:40:33.590 --> 01:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
recommendation that uh
 
01:40:36.390 --> 01:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
we meet in september and then at a
 
01:40:38.629 --> 01:40:38.639 align:start position:0%
subsequent meeting try to have a motion
 
01:40:41.350 --> 01:40:41.360 align:start position:0%
at that time so so and you know
 
01:40:43.270 --> 01:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
the this committee has a lot of interim
 
01:40:45.030 --> 01:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
study bills
 
01:40:46.070 --> 01:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
a lot
 
01:40:47.669 --> 01:40:47.679 align:start position:0%
and and there's going to be i think a
 
01:40:50.149 --> 01:40:50.159 align:start position:0%
number of full committee
 
01:40:52.390 --> 01:40:52.400 align:start position:0%
interim study meetings in september and
 
01:40:54.550 --> 01:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
i think rick has sort of reserved
 
01:40:56.310 --> 01:40:56.320 align:start position:0%
september for that plus we have to wrap
 
01:40:58.070 --> 01:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
up in september i think
 
01:41:00.550 --> 01:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
um with the with the full committee
 
01:41:01.750 --> 01:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
vote on
 
01:41:04.470 --> 01:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
the uh on these i don't see
 
01:41:04.480 --> 01:41:05.350 align:start position:0%
the uh on these i don't see
is

01:41:05.350 --> 01:41:05.360 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:41:07.669 --> 01:41:07.679 align:start position:0%
since a vote today would not be binding
 
01:41:10.310 --> 01:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
on the committee i i think we know how
 
01:41:13.430 --> 01:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
the vote would would would land
 
01:41:15.990 --> 01:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
given who's here today and is on the
 
01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:17.430 align:start position:0%
given who's here today and is on the
committee

01:41:17.430 --> 01:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:41:18.790 --> 01:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't really matter but at
 
01:41:21.030 --> 01:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
least as far as as far as our interim
 
01:41:23.590 --> 01:41:23.600 align:start position:0%
study concluding its work
 
01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:24.390 align:start position:0%
study concluding its work
um

01:41:24.390 --> 01:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:26.790 --> 01:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
rather than scheduling another
 
01:41:28.470 --> 01:41:28.480 align:start position:0%
meeting in a month where there's going
 
01:41:31.270 --> 01:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
to be a lot of meetings um i think we
 
01:41:33.510 --> 01:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
just go ahead and complete it today
 
01:41:35.030 --> 01:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:41:36.470 --> 01:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
and then we've got another meeting this
 
01:41:36.480 --> 01:41:37.750 align:start position:0%
and then we've got another meeting this
afternoon

01:41:37.750 --> 01:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
01:41:40.310 --> 01:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
in 45 minutes uh sure representative
 
01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:42.950 align:start position:0%
in 45 minutes uh sure representative
blissfield

01:41:42.950 --> 01:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:44.950 --> 01:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
thank you i hear absolutely hear what
 
01:41:46.550 --> 01:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
were saying just for me i tried to
 
01:41:47.990 --> 01:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
research a little bit ahead of time but
 
01:41:49.750 --> 01:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
it was important to me to hear what
 
01:41:52.229 --> 01:41:52.239 align:start position:0%
everyone had to say and digest all of it
 
01:41:54.310 --> 01:41:54.320 align:start position:0%
i personally would like to take it back
 
01:41:54.320 --> 01:41:55.109 align:start position:0%
i personally would like to take it back
to

01:41:55.109 --> 01:41:55.119 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:41:57.189 --> 01:41:57.199 align:start position:0%
my school district and bounce it off of
 
01:41:58.709 --> 01:41:58.719 align:start position:0%
some of them i'm not ready to take a
 
01:42:00.550 --> 01:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
vote i'm ready to dive in and do some
 
01:42:02.470 --> 01:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
more research and then
 
01:42:03.669 --> 01:42:03.679 align:start position:0%
make a vote
 
01:42:05.510 --> 01:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
if you're all willing in september i
 
01:42:08.870 --> 01:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
personally just need more time
 
01:42:11.189 --> 01:42:11.199 align:start position:0%
thank you blitzfield uh that's the way
 
01:42:14.149 --> 01:42:14.159 align:start position:0%
that i'm leading as i've already said uh
 
01:42:15.350 --> 01:42:15.360 align:start position:0%
we'll send a
 
01:42:19.350 --> 01:42:19.360 align:start position:0%
summary to the chair and then
 
01:42:22.070 --> 01:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
have a discussion with him and uh
 
01:42:24.149 --> 01:42:24.159 align:start position:0%
and probably
 
01:42:26.070 --> 01:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
we'll need to do this the right way we
 
01:42:27.430 --> 01:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
need to come back as representative
 
01:42:29.830 --> 01:42:29.840 align:start position:0%
tanner said and have a vote with with
 
01:42:31.669 --> 01:42:31.679 align:start position:0%
all the members here in september
 
01:42:33.510 --> 01:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
representative cornell i i think it will
 
01:42:35.350 --> 01:42:35.360 align:start position:0%
be hard to have
 
01:42:38.229 --> 01:42:38.239 align:start position:0%
a vote with the people who weren't here
 
01:42:40.629 --> 01:42:40.639 align:start position:0%
for this entire discussion to have them
 
01:42:43.510 --> 01:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
voting on they didn't hear any of the
 
01:42:45.910 --> 01:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
this discussion or no and i and i think
 
01:42:48.870 --> 01:42:48.880 align:start position:0%
it's okay to have subs on subcommittees
 
01:42:51.350 --> 01:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
and i think representatives hopson and
 
01:42:53.350 --> 01:42:53.360 align:start position:0%
ford are the two people that are here in
 
01:42:55.590 --> 01:42:55.600 align:start position:0%
place of
 
01:42:58.629 --> 01:42:58.639 align:start position:0%
representative lekkes and and saudi so
 
01:43:01.510 --> 01:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
i think we could have a vote
 
01:43:03.270 --> 01:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you
 
01:43:06.310 --> 01:43:06.320 align:start position:0%
i just would not feel right about having
 
01:43:08.790 --> 01:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
a vote uh involving
 
01:43:10.870 --> 01:43:10.880 align:start position:0%
folks that the chair did did not have in
 
01:43:12.870 --> 01:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
the committee i love that dave's here
 
01:43:15.910 --> 01:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
and that deb sarah that all of us here
 
01:43:18.629 --> 01:43:18.639 align:start position:0%
but i i would not feel right about
 
01:43:20.870 --> 01:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
having a vote
 
01:43:22.470 --> 01:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
without everybody
 
01:43:24.470 --> 01:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
and i don't think it's my call to let
 
01:43:27.109 --> 01:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
uh them vote while i'm glad they're here
 
01:43:28.550 --> 01:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
so again i'm going to recommend to the
 
01:43:31.590 --> 01:43:31.600 align:start position:0%
chair that uh if he
 
01:43:32.950 --> 01:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
wants us to
 
01:43:35.750 --> 01:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
make a recommendation uh that he then he
 
01:43:38.070 --> 01:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
can ask the the people that he's
 
01:43:39.510 --> 01:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
assigned to the committee to come back
 
01:43:41.830 --> 01:43:41.840 align:start position:0%
in september and if he wants to reassign
 
01:43:44.550 --> 01:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
anybody or expand the committee uh
 
01:43:45.990 --> 01:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
he's done that before i could do that
 
01:43:47.430 --> 01:43:47.440 align:start position:0%
again so that's that's where i'm at i'll
 
01:43:49.189 --> 01:43:49.199 align:start position:0%
make a report
 
01:43:50.870 --> 01:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
that you all will look at ahead of time
 
01:43:53.830 --> 01:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
send it to the chair and then let him
 
01:43:55.990 --> 01:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
make a recommendation as
 
01:43:58.550 --> 01:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
a september meeting
 
01:44:01.189 --> 01:44:01.199 align:start position:0%
and a vote or not
 
01:44:02.870 --> 01:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
can we ask that those that were absent
 
01:44:05.510 --> 01:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
review the youtube and so that they know
 
01:44:07.270 --> 01:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
exactly what we were talking about don't
 
01:44:08.950 --> 01:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
have the epp excellent point
 
01:44:12.310 --> 01:44:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:14.550 --> 01:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent point in this
 
01:44:16.790 --> 01:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
technologies there so somebody mentioned
 
01:44:19.430 --> 01:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
the concern that they weren't here well
 
01:44:19.440 --> 01:44:20.390 align:start position:0%
the concern that they weren't here well
uh

01:44:20.390 --> 01:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:44:22.229 --> 01:44:22.239 align:start position:0%
to the whole point of this bill and
 
01:44:24.470 --> 01:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
being on youtube forever they can review
 
01:44:26.629 --> 01:44:26.639 align:start position:0%
this and then they'll be read in
 
01:44:28.870 --> 01:44:28.880 align:start position:0%
so does that sound like an approach that
 
01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:29.990 align:start position:0%
so does that sound like an approach that
works

01:44:29.990 --> 01:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
works
 
01:44:31.910 --> 01:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
all right with the report send it to the
 
01:44:33.910 --> 01:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
chair he can have this meet in september
 
01:44:36.550 --> 01:44:36.560 align:start position:0%
if he wants and then uh we can have a
 
01:44:38.709 --> 01:44:38.719 align:start position:0%
vote um at that time
 
01:44:40.870 --> 01:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
what time we're gonna start the next uh
 
01:44:43.750 --> 01:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
schedule for one p.m
 
01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:44.709 align:start position:0%
schedule for one p.m
uh

01:44:44.709 --> 01:44:44.719 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:44:47.590 --> 01:44:47.600 align:start position:0%
i guess the chair can push it back
 
01:44:49.990 --> 01:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
you can't move in this i i wish i could
 
01:44:51.910 --> 01:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
have told diana so she didn't have to
 
01:44:53.990 --> 01:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
yeah uh what
 
01:44:57.669 --> 01:44:57.679 align:start position:0%
do you have diana's okay uh so 115.
 
01:44:59.109 --> 01:44:59.119 align:start position:0%
all right we'll see see then thank you
 
02:56:39.269 --> 02:56:39.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:40.550 --> 02:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
let's uh
 
02:56:43.349 --> 02:56:43.359 align:start position:0%
get started here if we could um
 
02:56:45.990 --> 02:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
representative ellison is here
 
02:56:49.349 --> 02:56:49.359 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
02:56:51.269 --> 02:56:51.279 align:start position:0%
i'm just looking at the roster epson
 
02:56:53.590 --> 02:56:53.600 align:start position:0%
hollis here represent luna is here
 
02:56:54.710 --> 02:56:54.720 align:start position:0%
representative hobson is here
 
02:56:57.190 --> 02:56:57.200 align:start position:0%
representative litzfield is here from
 
02:56:58.870 --> 02:56:58.880 align:start position:0%
office the owner from the assign
 
02:57:00.070 --> 02:57:00.080 align:start position:0%
committee who's not here is
 
02:57:01.910 --> 02:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
representative lekkas
 
02:57:04.950 --> 02:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
and we have uh some other visitors here
 
02:57:07.590 --> 02:57:07.600 align:start position:0%
welcome back representative ford and uh
 
02:57:10.550 --> 02:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
represent tanner is is back as well
 
02:57:13.269 --> 02:57:13.279 align:start position:0%
so uh to get right to it and i think i
 
02:57:16.950 --> 02:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
did check uh the youtube recording did
 
02:57:18.230 --> 02:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
is out there
 
02:57:19.510 --> 02:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
so i forgotten that that was gonna
 
02:57:21.429 --> 02:57:21.439 align:start position:0%
happen so uh but represent cornell made
 
02:57:23.190 --> 02:57:23.200 align:start position:0%
a good point that the there were at
 
02:57:25.269 --> 02:57:25.279 align:start position:0%
least two from the previous subcommittee
 
02:57:26.950 --> 02:57:26.960 align:start position:0%
who weren't here they can watch it and
 
02:57:29.030 --> 02:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh come back to that other
 
02:57:29.040 --> 02:57:29.990 align:start position:0%
uh come back to that other
bill

02:57:29.990 --> 02:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:57:31.670 --> 02:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
um at their
 
02:57:34.070 --> 02:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
convenience all right so this one this
 
02:57:36.309 --> 02:57:36.319 align:start position:0%
afternoon work session uh interim study
 
02:57:40.389 --> 02:57:40.399 align:start position:0%
work session on hb 1676 which has an fn
 
02:57:42.550 --> 02:57:42.560 align:start position:0%
it's maybe the shortest bill
 
02:57:44.230 --> 02:57:44.240 align:start position:0%
one of the shortest bills you you'll
 
02:57:48.070 --> 02:57:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:52.389 --> 02:57:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:58.710 --> 02:57:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:58.720 --> 02:58:00.550 align:start position:0%
 
to

02:58:00.550 --> 02:58:00.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:58:02.790 --> 02:58:02.800 align:start position:0%
reward school districts that improve
 
02:58:04.710 --> 02:58:04.720 align:start position:0%
their standardized test scores and
 
02:58:07.190 --> 02:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
that's the the that's it
 
02:58:08.710 --> 02:58:08.720 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:58:11.429 --> 02:58:11.439 align:start position:0%
real quick uh this also we had a hearing
 
02:58:13.110 --> 02:58:13.120 align:start position:0%
an exec session on it one of the things
 
02:58:15.030 --> 02:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
that came up and i mentioned this in a
 
02:58:17.990 --> 02:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
in an email that i put out
 
02:58:20.630 --> 02:58:20.640 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns that representative
 
02:58:23.030 --> 02:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
mary beth wallace flagged was
 
02:58:25.110 --> 02:58:25.120 align:start position:0%
the initial language in the
 
02:58:25.120 --> 02:58:26.389 align:start position:0%
the initial language in the
measure

02:58:26.389 --> 02:58:26.399 align:start position:0%
measure
 
02:58:28.230 --> 02:58:28.240 align:start position:0%
called for a transfer from the so-called
 
02:58:30.950 --> 02:58:30.960 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund
 
02:58:32.469 --> 02:58:32.479 align:start position:0%
to doe
 
02:58:36.230 --> 02:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
to create a an account and then
 
02:58:38.550 --> 02:58:38.560 align:start position:0%
establish a criteria
 
02:58:40.870 --> 02:58:40.880 align:start position:0%
to reward schools that
 
02:58:43.269 --> 02:58:43.279 align:start position:0%
improve their standardized test scores
 
02:58:45.590 --> 02:58:45.600 align:start position:0%
so one of the issues was was that the
 
02:58:48.389 --> 02:58:48.399 align:start position:0%
right way to do it if we do it and if we
 
02:58:49.830 --> 02:58:49.840 align:start position:0%
did do it should there be a separate
 
02:58:51.990 --> 02:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
line item so i'm going to kind of leave
 
02:58:54.309 --> 02:58:54.319 align:start position:0%
it at that and uh
 
02:58:57.670 --> 02:58:57.680 align:start position:0%
i'm just we're interested in
 
02:59:00.389 --> 02:59:00.399 align:start position:0%
some perspectives on on
 
02:59:02.230 --> 02:59:02.240 align:start position:0%
this proposed measure
 
02:59:02.240 --> 02:59:03.349 align:start position:0%
this proposed measure
representative

02:59:03.349 --> 02:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:59:06.469 --> 02:59:06.479 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chair just being relatively
 
02:59:09.030 --> 02:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
new to the process the outcome of a
 
02:59:11.349 --> 02:59:11.359 align:start position:0%
study committee usually is
 
02:59:13.990 --> 02:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
we recommend it's pass it does not pass
 
02:59:16.469 --> 02:59:16.479 align:start position:0%
it passes with amendments
 
02:59:18.630 --> 02:59:18.640 align:start position:0%
what does that usually look like
 
02:59:20.389 --> 02:59:20.399 align:start position:0%
sure thanks for the question i've done a
 
02:59:22.389 --> 02:59:22.399 align:start position:0%
number of these i'm sure others have as
 
02:59:24.150 --> 02:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
well uh
 
02:59:26.870 --> 02:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
typically yes uh the work said you'll
 
02:59:28.389 --> 02:59:28.399 align:start position:0%
have a work session or multiple work
 
02:59:30.710 --> 02:59:30.720 align:start position:0%
sessions and eventually
 
02:59:32.550 --> 02:59:32.560 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee will
 
02:59:35.830 --> 02:59:35.840 align:start position:0%
take a vote on a measure
 
02:59:35.840 --> 02:59:36.550 align:start position:0%
take a vote on a measure
to

02:59:36.550 --> 02:59:36.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:59:39.429 --> 02:59:39.439 align:start position:0%
i think the choices in this case are to
 
02:59:42.070 --> 02:59:42.080 align:start position:0%
recommend otp
 
02:59:44.870 --> 02:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
or itl and i i believe it may be
 
02:59:44.880 --> 02:59:46.550 align:start position:0%
or itl and i i believe it may be
representative

02:59:46.550 --> 02:59:46.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:59:49.670 --> 02:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
uh i know if an option is to recommend a
 
02:59:52.230 --> 02:59:52.240 align:start position:0%
version of otpa in other words
 
02:59:52.240 --> 02:59:53.349 align:start position:0%
version of otpa in other words
uh

02:59:53.349 --> 02:59:53.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:59:56.309 --> 02:59:56.319 align:start position:0%
for example from what i just said if
 
02:59:59.269 --> 02:59:59.279 align:start position:0%
there's a motion to support this
 
03:00:01.670 --> 03:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
measure if it was amended so that the
 
03:00:04.150 --> 03:00:04.160 align:start position:0%
funding did was a separate line item as
 
03:00:06.150 --> 03:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
opposed to coming from the rainy day
 
03:00:08.630 --> 03:00:08.640 align:start position:0%
fund so i think there's an otp
 
03:00:10.630 --> 03:00:10.640 align:start position:0%
otpa option as well that could be
 
03:00:12.710 --> 03:00:12.720 align:start position:0%
recommended to the full committee that
 
03:00:14.070 --> 03:00:14.080 align:start position:0%
if you probably yeah
 
03:00:15.830 --> 03:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
so thanks mike i think that would
 
03:00:16.950 --> 03:00:16.960 align:start position:0%
actually be
 
03:00:19.269 --> 03:00:19.279 align:start position:0%
inside of the uh the committee report so
 
03:00:21.429 --> 03:00:21.439 align:start position:0%
there's that what we'll do
 
03:00:23.190 --> 03:00:23.200 align:start position:0%
what the committee will do eventually is
 
03:00:26.710 --> 03:00:26.720 align:start position:0%
vote on on the the two motions would be
 
03:00:28.870 --> 03:00:28.880 align:start position:0%
recommended for of
 
03:00:30.710 --> 03:00:30.720 align:start position:0%
future legislation or not recommended
 
03:00:33.349 --> 03:00:33.359 align:start position:0%
for future legislation and there would
 
03:00:36.150 --> 03:00:36.160 align:start position:0%
also be a very short committee report
 
03:00:38.230 --> 03:00:38.240 align:start position:0%
two or three sentences and that's where
 
03:00:39.910 --> 03:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
you could put uh you know if it was
 
03:00:43.030 --> 03:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
recommended for future to include
 
03:00:46.389 --> 03:00:46.399 align:start position:0%
you know such and such changes so yeah
 
03:00:48.389 --> 03:00:48.399 align:start position:0%
so i guess there's three options
 
03:00:50.950 --> 03:00:50.960 align:start position:0%
basically is the uh representative
 
03:00:54.389 --> 03:00:54.399 align:start position:0%
explained there is a kind of an otp
 
03:00:57.269 --> 03:00:57.279 align:start position:0%
otpa option future or not it's either
 
03:01:00.230 --> 03:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:00.240 --> 03:01:02.469 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:01:02.469 --> 03:01:02.479 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:01:05.510 --> 03:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
okay uh and representative ford you know
 
03:01:07.429 --> 03:01:07.439 align:start position:0%
well you're very quiet this morning if
 
03:01:09.510 --> 03:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
you want to sound off i mean it's a work
 
03:01:12.309 --> 03:01:12.319 align:start position:0%
session so insane representation is not
 
03:01:14.150 --> 03:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
on this was not assigned to this but
 
03:01:14.160 --> 03:01:17.110 align:start position:0%
on this was not assigned to this but
again

03:01:17.110 --> 03:01:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:20.870 --> 03:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
attorney fenton is back and uh
 
03:01:23.670 --> 03:01:23.680 align:start position:0%
may have some input as well or have a
 
03:01:26.070 --> 03:01:26.080 align:start position:0%
chance to answer some questions
 
03:01:27.670 --> 03:01:27.680 align:start position:0%
so um
 
03:01:29.750 --> 03:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
i i spoke a lot this morning try not to
 
03:01:31.429 --> 03:01:31.439 align:start position:0%
speak as much so i have a few thoughts
 
03:01:33.269 --> 03:01:33.279 align:start position:0%
on this but i um
 
03:01:35.510 --> 03:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
you know who else who
 
03:01:39.750 --> 03:01:39.760 align:start position:0%
wants to uh offer some thoughts on this
 
03:01:42.710 --> 03:01:42.720 align:start position:0%
1676 representative hall
 
03:01:44.790 --> 03:01:44.800 align:start position:0%
i just had a question about does anyone
 
03:01:46.870 --> 03:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
know and maybe that's attorney fenton
 
03:01:48.630 --> 03:01:48.640 align:start position:0%
back when we you know schools for city
 
03:01:50.950 --> 03:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
schools i mean do we have all of that
 
03:01:52.710 --> 03:01:52.720 align:start position:0%
data like when schools of neighbor
 
03:01:55.269 --> 03:01:55.279 align:start position:0%
improvement and they they were targeted
 
03:01:57.269 --> 03:01:57.279 align:start position:0%
to be those city schools and they had to
 
03:01:58.710 --> 03:01:58.720 align:start position:0%
come up with their i think it might have
 
03:02:00.230 --> 03:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
been another one whether those sips
 
03:02:02.150 --> 03:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
school improvement plans and all that
 
03:02:04.150 --> 03:02:04.160 align:start position:0%
just do we have that data
 
03:02:05.990 --> 03:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
as to where they came and
 
03:02:08.630 --> 03:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
they came and went you know what i mean
 
03:02:11.190 --> 03:02:11.200 align:start position:0%
like was it successful or
 
03:02:13.269 --> 03:02:13.279 align:start position:0%
circles improve their standardized
 
03:02:14.790 --> 03:02:14.800 align:start position:0%
scores or
 
03:02:16.389 --> 03:02:16.399 align:start position:0%
attorneys attorney to kind of speed
 
03:02:18.790 --> 03:02:18.800 align:start position:0%
things along this afternoon can i invite
 
03:02:20.950 --> 03:02:20.960 align:start position:0%
you to come up to the uh to the
 
03:02:23.269 --> 03:02:23.279 align:start position:0%
microphone and and
 
03:02:24.870 --> 03:02:24.880 align:start position:0%
as these questions come up rather than
 
03:02:27.269 --> 03:02:27.279 align:start position:0%
save you for the end like
 
03:02:31.750 --> 03:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
i don't want to say dessert but uh it's
 
03:02:33.190 --> 03:02:33.200 align:start position:0%
maybe we can
 
03:02:34.790 --> 03:02:34.800 align:start position:0%
get you involved right quick here to
 
03:02:36.550 --> 03:02:36.560 align:start position:0%
keep things moving
 
03:02:37.830 --> 03:02:37.840 align:start position:0%
and did you hear up to the false
 
03:02:37.840 --> 03:02:39.670 align:start position:0%
and did you hear up to the false
question

03:02:39.670 --> 03:02:39.680 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:02:44.950 --> 03:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:47.750 --> 03:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
back a few years ago we had the you know
 
03:02:49.670 --> 03:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
schools are targeted according to their
 
03:02:52.790 --> 03:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
test scores and they were identified as
 
03:02:54.550 --> 03:02:54.560 align:start position:0%
city schools
 
03:02:55.990 --> 03:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
and they had to come up with you know
 
03:02:57.830 --> 03:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
schools in need of improvement and then
 
03:03:00.469 --> 03:03:00.479 align:start position:0%
they were they had sip plans the school
 
03:03:02.550 --> 03:03:02.560 align:start position:0%
improvement plans and at some point it
 
03:03:04.150 --> 03:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
was decided that every school was going
 
03:03:05.670 --> 03:03:05.680 align:start position:0%
to be a school in need of improvement
 
03:03:07.910 --> 03:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
because of their scores and whatnot so
 
03:03:09.590 --> 03:03:09.600 align:start position:0%
what happened to that
 
03:03:09.600 --> 03:03:10.790 align:start position:0%
what happened to that
um

03:03:10.790 --> 03:03:10.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:03:12.790 --> 03:03:12.800 align:start position:0%
do we know because it's kind of the same
 
03:03:15.110 --> 03:03:15.120 align:start position:0%
thing it was an incentive to bring your
 
03:03:17.110 --> 03:03:17.120 align:start position:0%
test scores up
 
03:03:19.269 --> 03:03:19.279 align:start position:0%
do we know what ever happened or did it
 
03:03:20.870 --> 03:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
just fall apart because it wasn't
 
03:03:22.150 --> 03:03:22.160 align:start position:0%
working or
 
03:03:22.160 --> 03:03:23.510 align:start position:0%
working or
what

03:03:23.510 --> 03:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
what
 
03:03:24.790 --> 03:03:24.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question for the
 
03:03:26.469 --> 03:03:26.479 align:start position:0%
record diana fenton uh with the
 
03:03:28.150 --> 03:03:28.160 align:start position:0%
department of education i i don't know
 
03:03:29.590 --> 03:03:29.600 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head as the short
 
03:03:31.750 --> 03:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
answer i can i can look into that but
 
03:03:34.469 --> 03:03:34.479 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of that program um
 
03:03:36.070 --> 03:03:36.080 align:start position:0%
i i don't think anything necessarily
 
03:03:38.070 --> 03:03:38.080 align:start position:0%
fell apart but there might have been a
 
03:03:41.190 --> 03:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
time span in which that program was run
 
03:03:42.230 --> 03:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
and then
 
03:03:44.389 --> 03:03:44.399 align:start position:0%
there's no additional follow-up that's
 
03:03:46.070 --> 03:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
typically and again i'm not speaking
 
03:03:47.670 --> 03:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
directly to the program you mentioned
 
03:03:49.910 --> 03:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
but that's typically what we've seen
 
03:03:52.309 --> 03:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
historically so but i can certainly look
 
03:03:57.110 --> 03:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:58.150 --> 03:03:58.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:03:59.830 --> 03:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
that maybe he's a prime sponsor i should
 
03:04:02.150 --> 03:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
offer just a few words on this
 
03:04:02.160 --> 03:04:03.910 align:start position:0%
offer just a few words on this
to

03:04:03.910 --> 03:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:04:05.910 --> 03:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
provide a little bit of fidelity or
 
03:04:05.920 --> 03:04:06.870 align:start position:0%
provide a little bit of fidelity or
whatever

03:04:06.870 --> 03:04:06.880 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
03:04:09.030 --> 03:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
so the the impetus behind this and you
 
03:04:10.950 --> 03:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
know most all of you were at the hearing
 
03:04:12.550 --> 03:04:12.560 align:start position:0%
when this first came up as every bill
 
03:04:14.230 --> 03:04:14.240 align:start position:0%
does and we talked about this summit
 
03:04:16.630 --> 03:04:16.640 align:start position:0%
exec session and it was recommended for
 
03:04:17.910 --> 03:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
03:04:20.469 --> 03:04:20.479 align:start position:0%
uh the thinking behind this again is a
 
03:04:23.030 --> 03:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor among several sponsors
 
03:04:25.750 --> 03:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
is that
 
03:04:27.269 --> 03:04:27.279 align:start position:0%
i and we
 
03:04:30.630 --> 03:04:30.640 align:start position:0%
saw and see some utility and some value
 
03:04:30.640 --> 03:04:32.230 align:start position:0%
saw and see some utility and some value
to

03:04:32.230 --> 03:04:32.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:04:32.240 --> 03:04:33.990 align:start position:0%
to
rewarding

03:04:33.990 --> 03:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
rewarding
 
03:04:35.910 --> 03:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
schools that
 
03:04:35.920 --> 03:04:37.190 align:start position:0%
schools that
improve

03:04:37.190 --> 03:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
improve
 
03:04:39.750 --> 03:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
and is and we spend so much time on
 
03:04:41.190 --> 03:04:41.200 align:start position:0%
school funding
 
03:04:42.950 --> 03:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
and right now
 
03:04:44.710 --> 03:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
as you all know so well
 
03:04:48.389 --> 03:04:48.399 align:start position:0%
there are mechanisms in place to
 
03:04:50.790 --> 03:04:50.800 align:start position:0%
help schools for example with low third
 
03:04:52.550 --> 03:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
grade reading scores
 
03:04:54.070 --> 03:04:54.080 align:start position:0%
now the concern i'm sure you've all
 
03:04:55.429 --> 03:04:55.439 align:start position:0%
heard this before
 
03:04:58.150 --> 03:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
to some folks it that is a
 
03:05:01.110 --> 03:05:01.120 align:start position:0%
a disincentive of sorts at least in some
 
03:05:02.710 --> 03:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
people's minds in other words the worse
 
03:05:04.870 --> 03:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
they do the worse the third graders are
 
03:05:06.550 --> 03:05:06.560 align:start position:0%
reading the more money they get
 
03:05:08.630 --> 03:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
and say the intent of that is to
 
03:05:10.550 --> 03:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
identify schools that are struggling and
 
03:05:12.469 --> 03:05:12.479 align:start position:0%
give them money the assumption being
 
03:05:13.910 --> 03:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
that they the money will help you
 
03:05:15.750 --> 03:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
improve their instruction which
 
03:05:19.269 --> 03:05:19.279 align:start position:0%
is different uh perspectives on how
 
03:05:21.190 --> 03:05:21.200 align:start position:0%
effective that is
 
03:05:23.510 --> 03:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh so the thinking here is
 
03:05:26.550 --> 03:05:26.560 align:start position:0%
uh and i i hate to say reward reward
 
03:05:29.110 --> 03:05:29.120 align:start position:0%
failure that's i'm not i don't want to
 
03:05:31.190 --> 03:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
use that term some others have used that
 
03:05:33.670 --> 03:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
term in term with regard to
 
03:05:33.680 --> 03:05:34.790 align:start position:0%
term in term with regard to
uh

03:05:34.790 --> 03:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:05:37.269 --> 03:05:37.279 align:start position:0%
giving money to districts whose third
 
03:05:39.030 --> 03:05:39.040 align:start position:0%
grade scores are low
 
03:05:40.309 --> 03:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
again as i just said i understand the
 
03:05:41.510 --> 03:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
intent of that
 
03:05:45.990 --> 03:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
but there's also a mindset that if
 
03:05:48.469 --> 03:05:48.479 align:start position:0%
we can somehow
 
03:05:48.479 --> 03:05:49.349 align:start position:0%
we can somehow
give

03:05:49.349 --> 03:05:49.359 align:start position:0%
give
 
03:05:51.910 --> 03:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
districts incentives to
 
03:05:51.920 --> 03:05:52.950 align:start position:0%
districts incentives to
uh

03:05:52.950 --> 03:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:05:55.510 --> 03:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
apply some approaches that maybe have
 
03:05:58.870 --> 03:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
been proven effective elsewhere
 
03:06:00.790 --> 03:06:00.800 align:start position:0%
that there may be some utility to that
 
03:06:04.950 --> 03:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
now going back to the hearing um
 
03:06:07.110 --> 03:06:07.120 align:start position:0%
it came up about uh
 
03:06:09.429 --> 03:06:09.439 align:start position:0%
competition and
 
03:06:11.030 --> 03:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
this is not
 
03:06:13.190 --> 03:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
this as we say as the sponsors see it
 
03:06:15.590 --> 03:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
this does not involve competing against
 
03:06:17.990 --> 03:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
any other school all this involves is
 
03:06:18.000 --> 03:06:19.349 align:start position:0%
any other school all this involves is
proposed

03:06:19.349 --> 03:06:19.359 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
03:06:19.359 --> 03:06:20.230 align:start position:0%
proposed
is

03:06:20.230 --> 03:06:20.240 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:06:20.240 --> 03:06:21.349 align:start position:0%
is
competing

03:06:21.349 --> 03:06:21.359 align:start position:0%
competing
 
03:06:24.550 --> 03:06:24.560 align:start position:0%
so to speak against a baseline
 
03:06:27.750 --> 03:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
against a school's
 
03:06:29.590 --> 03:06:29.600 align:start position:0%
establish whatever baseline is
 
03:06:31.590 --> 03:06:31.600 align:start position:0%
established in terms of whatever
 
03:06:33.590 --> 03:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
assessment is used now i
 
03:06:35.190 --> 03:06:35.200 align:start position:0%
have to as i said earlier this morning
 
03:06:36.950 --> 03:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
some of us spoke informally with some
 
03:06:39.830 --> 03:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
folks at d.o.e about the general concept
 
03:06:41.670 --> 03:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
of this and there was some interest in
 
03:06:41.680 --> 03:06:42.469 align:start position:0%
of this and there was some interest in
that

03:06:42.469 --> 03:06:42.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:06:42.479 --> 03:06:44.469 align:start position:0%
that
uh

03:06:44.469 --> 03:06:44.479 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:06:46.070 --> 03:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
the question
 
03:06:47.750 --> 03:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
if this moves forward at some point we
 
03:06:49.590 --> 03:06:49.600 align:start position:0%
come back to it next year
 
03:06:52.230 --> 03:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
uh what assessment should be used and
 
03:06:54.870 --> 03:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
katelyn davis had some ideas though we
 
03:06:58.150 --> 03:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
did not in the initial
 
03:06:58.160 --> 03:06:59.830 align:start position:0%
did not in the initial
proposal

03:06:59.830 --> 03:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
03:07:03.750 --> 03:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
specifically identify any assessment yet
 
03:07:03.760 --> 03:07:04.790 align:start position:0%
specifically identify any assessment yet
but

03:07:04.790 --> 03:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:07:06.710 --> 03:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
with this to move forward
 
03:07:10.230 --> 03:07:10.240 align:start position:0%
uh one vision is that
 
03:07:12.309 --> 03:07:12.319 align:start position:0%
doe would have
 
03:07:12.319 --> 03:07:13.110 align:start position:0%
doe would have
the

03:07:13.110 --> 03:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:07:15.190 --> 03:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
authority to
 
03:07:17.190 --> 03:07:17.200 align:start position:0%
work with stakeholders to identify the
 
03:07:19.190 --> 03:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
best assessment and then the criteria
 
03:07:21.510 --> 03:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
for for rewards
 
03:07:24.469 --> 03:07:24.479 align:start position:0%
so there's a little bit more background
 
03:07:27.750 --> 03:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
on the thinking behind this and again
 
03:07:30.710 --> 03:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
wanting to reward achievement
 
03:07:33.750 --> 03:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
as opposed to simply also rewarding
 
03:07:37.429 --> 03:07:37.439 align:start position:0%
if rewarding is the right word
 
03:07:40.710 --> 03:07:40.720 align:start position:0%
you know giving money to schools that
 
03:07:42.710 --> 03:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
have established uh
 
03:07:44.309 --> 03:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
low scores
 
03:07:44.319 --> 03:07:45.269 align:start position:0%
low scores
so

03:07:45.269 --> 03:07:45.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:07:49.830 --> 03:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:51.750 --> 03:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
representative luna
 
03:07:54.230 --> 03:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mike um a couple
 
03:07:56.389 --> 03:07:56.399 align:start position:0%
things i just want to want to point out
 
03:07:58.790 --> 03:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
first of all i think in the um
 
03:07:59.910 --> 03:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
in the
 
03:08:03.030 --> 03:08:03.040 align:start position:0%
the research and uh report that was
 
03:08:04.710 --> 03:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
prepared by the commission to study
 
03:08:07.190 --> 03:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
school funding we
 
03:08:07.200 --> 03:08:08.870 align:start position:0%
school funding we
actually

03:08:08.870 --> 03:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
actually
 
03:08:10.469 --> 03:08:10.479 align:start position:0%
went away from
 
03:08:10.479 --> 03:08:11.190 align:start position:0%
went away from
the

03:08:11.190 --> 03:08:11.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:08:14.469 --> 03:08:14.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:17.510 --> 03:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
characteristic and and instead focused
 
03:08:19.349 --> 03:08:19.359 align:start position:0%
on true student characteristics and
 
03:08:21.590 --> 03:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
district characteristics when when
 
03:08:23.910 --> 03:08:23.920 align:start position:0%
looking at how to properly fund schools
 
03:08:26.309 --> 03:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
so we looked at free and reduced priced
 
03:08:28.150 --> 03:08:28.160 align:start position:0%
lunch as a proxy for
 
03:08:28.160 --> 03:08:29.510 align:start position:0%
lunch as a proxy for
for

03:08:29.510 --> 03:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:08:29.520 --> 03:08:31.429 align:start position:0%
for
economic

03:08:31.429 --> 03:08:31.439 align:start position:0%
economic
 
03:08:34.230 --> 03:08:34.240 align:start position:0%
factors family factors english language
 
03:08:37.030 --> 03:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
learners special education and district
 
03:08:38.630 --> 03:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
school district size
 
03:08:42.550 --> 03:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
and so um so a a formula was developed
 
03:08:45.910 --> 03:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
around these factors to um
 
03:08:49.830 --> 03:08:49.840 align:start position:0%
to basically connect with a a predicted
 
03:08:52.469 --> 03:08:52.479 align:start position:0%
uh cost for a school district to educate
 
03:08:54.309 --> 03:08:54.319 align:start position:0%
all of its students to a statewide
 
03:08:54.319 --> 03:08:56.870 align:start position:0%
all of its students to a statewide
outcome

03:08:56.870 --> 03:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:59.830 --> 03:08:59.840 align:start position:0%
using data that the doe has collected
 
03:09:03.269 --> 03:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
for the last decade so so i agree with
 
03:09:04.790 --> 03:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
you that the third grade reading i think
 
03:09:06.230 --> 03:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
there's there's there's certainly
 
03:09:09.510 --> 03:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
rationale for not using that as a
 
03:09:10.950 --> 03:09:10.960 align:start position:0%
as a
 
03:09:13.190 --> 03:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
performance factor in in
 
03:09:14.950 --> 03:09:14.960 align:start position:0%
in determining funding but actually
 
03:09:17.030 --> 03:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
using using
 
03:09:17.040 --> 03:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
using using

predicted costs on what it would take
 
03:09:23.030 --> 03:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
for a school district to educate its
 
03:09:24.389 --> 03:09:24.399 align:start position:0%
students to a
 
03:09:26.070 --> 03:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
to a
 
03:09:28.070 --> 03:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
a statewide average
 
03:09:30.790 --> 03:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
the um the second thing i wanted to um
 
03:09:33.830 --> 03:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
sort of just note from the um the the
 
03:09:37.349 --> 03:09:37.359 align:start position:0%
bill as as introduced is that uh there's
 
03:09:39.349 --> 03:09:39.359 align:start position:0%
a you know it's a million dollar
 
03:09:41.670 --> 03:09:41.680 align:start position:0%
appropriation with a fifty thousand
 
03:09:44.469 --> 03:09:44.479 align:start position:0%
dollar cap per school district
 
03:09:46.469 --> 03:09:46.479 align:start position:0%
and i think fifty thousand dollars you
 
03:09:49.190 --> 03:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
know in a district like pittsfield uh
 
03:09:52.309 --> 03:09:52.319 align:start position:0%
might mean a lot more than say fifty
 
03:09:54.309 --> 03:09:54.319 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in a district like
 
03:09:56.229 --> 03:09:56.239 align:start position:0%
manchester and nashua
 
03:09:59.910 --> 03:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
and um and so where we're looking to um
 
03:10:03.750 --> 03:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
to do something as as an incentive
 
03:10:03.760 --> 03:10:04.550 align:start position:0%
to do something as as an incentive
um

03:10:04.550 --> 03:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:06.790 --> 03:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
you know i'm i'm i'm not sure it's
 
03:10:09.030 --> 03:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily a fair reward
 
03:10:11.110 --> 03:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
um given the the
 
03:10:13.429 --> 03:10:13.439 align:start position:0%
sort of disparate sizes we have you know
 
03:10:16.630 --> 03:10:16.640 align:start position:0%
across the state in in school districts
 
03:10:16.640 --> 03:10:17.510 align:start position:0%
across the state in in school districts
uh

03:10:17.510 --> 03:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:10:19.590 --> 03:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
the uh and then i guess the other thing
 
03:10:21.830 --> 03:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
from uh from a school funding
 
03:10:21.840 --> 03:10:23.110 align:start position:0%
from uh from a school funding
perspective

03:10:23.110 --> 03:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
03:10:25.750 --> 03:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
um uh first of all you know a million
 
03:10:29.030 --> 03:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
dollars on a on a on a on a just short
 
03:10:31.670 --> 03:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
of 1.1 billion dollars state
 
03:10:31.680 --> 03:10:32.630 align:start position:0%
of 1.1 billion dollars state
state

03:10:32.630 --> 03:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:10:36.229 --> 03:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
spend a 3 billion total spend isn't
 
03:10:38.309 --> 03:10:38.319 align:start position:0%
really going to move the needle much for
 
03:10:41.670 --> 03:10:41.680 align:start position:0%
for anybody and um and certainly in a in
 
03:10:44.469 --> 03:10:44.479 align:start position:0%
a district like like let's say a small
 
03:10:47.269 --> 03:10:47.279 align:start position:0%
district it uh it might be able to help
 
03:10:48.389 --> 03:10:48.399 align:start position:0%
pay for
 
03:10:51.990 --> 03:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
you know a 0.5 fte um you know social
 
03:10:54.550 --> 03:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
work or something like that or or school
 
03:10:57.030 --> 03:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
counselor but in a uh you know in a
 
03:10:59.349 --> 03:10:59.359 align:start position:0%
larger district like manchester nashua
 
03:11:02.229 --> 03:11:02.239 align:start position:0%
concord um it's it's not going to do
 
03:11:04.469 --> 03:11:04.479 align:start position:0%
much in terms of
 
03:11:07.030 --> 03:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
03:11:09.030 --> 03:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
what the district can can do with with
 
03:11:11.429 --> 03:11:11.439 align:start position:0%
those funds so those those are really my
 
03:11:14.790 --> 03:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
comments on the on the bill
 
03:11:16.229 --> 03:11:16.239 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you representative
 
03:11:19.429 --> 03:11:19.439 align:start position:0%
um and if you don't have the bill he's
 
03:11:21.030 --> 03:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
you can find that in life you don't have
 
03:11:22.950 --> 03:11:22.960 align:start position:0%
a copyright in front of you there was a
 
03:11:26.550 --> 03:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
cap in the original measure uh of 50 000
 
03:11:28.550 --> 03:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:11:31.030 --> 03:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
and i think that's a fair comment in the
 
03:11:33.269 --> 03:11:33.279 align:start position:0%
sense that in the grand scheme of things
 
03:11:36.229 --> 03:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
how much is 50 000 as you say pittsfield
 
03:11:38.630 --> 03:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
it would mean more than a larger school
 
03:11:40.790 --> 03:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
so the numbers is just me talking the
 
03:11:42.790 --> 03:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
numbers can be tweaked if some version
 
03:11:44.070 --> 03:11:44.080 align:start position:0%
of this ever moves forward i hope it
 
03:11:46.870 --> 03:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
does i believe i believe in it i believe
 
03:11:49.429 --> 03:11:49.439 align:start position:0%
in incentives and rewarding success in
 
03:11:51.429 --> 03:11:51.439 align:start position:0%
some fashion however it may or may not
 
03:11:52.630 --> 03:11:52.640 align:start position:0%
ever happen
 
03:11:54.710 --> 03:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
um but you know
 
03:11:56.469 --> 03:11:56.479 align:start position:0%
50 000 or
 
03:11:58.150 --> 03:11:58.160 align:start position:0%
if we double it to
 
03:12:00.070 --> 03:12:00.080 align:start position:0%
2 million or 100 000
 
03:12:00.080 --> 03:12:00.950 align:start position:0%
2 million or 100 000
um

03:12:00.950 --> 03:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:12:03.349 --> 03:12:03.359 align:start position:0%
it helps and and i know
 
03:12:05.349 --> 03:12:05.359 align:start position:0%
school funding has been something that
 
03:12:07.830 --> 03:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
you've especially been concerned about
 
03:12:10.309 --> 03:12:10.319 align:start position:0%
and i think everyone my responsibility
 
03:12:12.870 --> 03:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
every little bit helps but beyond that
 
03:12:12.880 --> 03:12:14.070 align:start position:0%
every little bit helps but beyond that
um

03:12:14.070 --> 03:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:12:17.110 --> 03:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:19.110 --> 03:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
improved their
 
03:12:21.030 --> 03:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
assessment score whatever the assessment
 
03:12:23.510 --> 03:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
may be how whatever the criteria may be
 
03:12:26.349 --> 03:12:26.359 align:start position:0%
whatever the amount may be
 
03:12:26.359 --> 03:12:27.990 align:start position:0%
whatever the amount may be
psychologically

03:12:27.990 --> 03:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
psychologically
 
03:12:31.030 --> 03:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh any school that won an award whether
 
03:12:33.110 --> 03:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
it's 50 000 or
 
03:12:34.389 --> 03:12:34.399 align:start position:0%
any amount
 
03:12:36.790 --> 03:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
is a cost for celebration i think that
 
03:12:36.800 --> 03:12:37.830 align:start position:0%
is a cost for celebration i think that
uh

03:12:37.830 --> 03:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:12:39.590 --> 03:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
in terms of morale
 
03:12:41.590 --> 03:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
and public support and parental support
 
03:12:43.429 --> 03:12:43.439 align:start position:0%
and school pride
 
03:12:45.510 --> 03:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
any school that
 
03:12:47.110 --> 03:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
earned an award
 
03:12:49.910 --> 03:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
i think there's an intrinsic value to
 
03:12:52.070 --> 03:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
that beyond just the monetary value i
 
03:12:54.150 --> 03:12:54.160 align:start position:0%
think that if
 
03:12:56.229 --> 03:12:56.239 align:start position:0%
winning an award increased parental
 
03:12:58.309 --> 03:12:58.319 align:start position:0%
support for the local school
 
03:13:00.469 --> 03:13:00.479 align:start position:0%
as i said uh school pride i think
 
03:13:03.670 --> 03:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
there's value to that um you know
 
03:13:05.830 --> 03:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
intrinsic value beyond just the monetary
 
03:13:05.840 --> 03:13:07.750 align:start position:0%
intrinsic value beyond just the monetary
value

03:13:07.750 --> 03:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
value
 
03:13:07.760 --> 03:13:08.630 align:start position:0%
value
uh

03:13:08.630 --> 03:13:08.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:13:10.150 --> 03:13:10.160 align:start position:0%
other thoughts
 
03:13:15.670 --> 03:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:17.510 --> 03:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
all right representative fred please you
 
03:13:17.520 --> 03:13:21.030 align:start position:0%
all right representative fred please you
go

03:13:21.030 --> 03:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:22.630 --> 03:13:22.640 align:start position:0%
my question was
 
03:13:25.510 --> 03:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
actually is there any specific
 
03:13:28.309 --> 03:13:28.319 align:start position:0%
designation of an award what is the
 
03:13:31.030 --> 03:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
award given to accomplish
 
03:13:34.550 --> 03:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
i assume it means i'm
 
03:13:37.110 --> 03:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
simply assuming that if you did well at
 
03:13:38.870 --> 03:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
that you're going to do more of it and
 
03:13:40.229 --> 03:13:40.239 align:start position:0%
improve it more
 
03:13:42.469 --> 03:13:42.479 align:start position:0%
i don't know but was there ever a
 
03:13:45.429 --> 03:13:45.439 align:start position:0%
specific specific objective
 
03:13:49.269 --> 03:13:49.279 align:start position:0%
for the award to be utilized to achieve
 
03:13:51.110 --> 03:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
sure remember thank you as a prime
 
03:13:52.710 --> 03:13:52.720 align:start position:0%
sponsor i'll try to answer that yeah the
 
03:13:56.070 --> 03:13:56.080 align:start position:0%
objective is to
 
03:13:58.630 --> 03:13:58.640 align:start position:0%
incentivize and reward and shine a light
 
03:14:00.070 --> 03:14:00.080 align:start position:0%
on success
 
03:14:00.080 --> 03:14:02.790 align:start position:0%
on success
and

03:14:02.790 --> 03:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:05.590 --> 03:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
supplement supplementary to that
 
03:14:08.830 --> 03:14:08.840 align:start position:0%
if a school
 
03:14:11.830 --> 03:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
improved whatever assessment scores
 
03:14:13.429 --> 03:14:13.439 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
03:14:13.439 --> 03:14:14.309 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
uh

03:14:14.309 --> 03:14:14.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:14:15.990 --> 03:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
i think that could potentially this
 
03:14:17.830 --> 03:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
isn't in the language but this is in the
 
03:14:19.910 --> 03:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
thinking if the school improve their
 
03:14:21.830 --> 03:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
scores and some people might look at
 
03:14:23.750 --> 03:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
that school and say okay what did you do
 
03:14:23.760 --> 03:14:24.710 align:start position:0%
that school and say okay what did you do
different

03:14:24.710 --> 03:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
different
 
03:14:26.550 --> 03:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
uh how did you improve your scores is
 
03:14:26.560 --> 03:14:27.349 align:start position:0%
uh how did you improve your scores is
that

03:14:27.349 --> 03:14:27.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:14:29.429 --> 03:14:29.439 align:start position:0%
something that we in a different
 
03:14:31.030 --> 03:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
district could look at or consider
 
03:14:31.040 --> 03:14:32.150 align:start position:0%
district could look at or consider
that's

03:14:32.150 --> 03:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
that's
 
03:14:34.070 --> 03:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
that's another piece of this it's not
 
03:14:34.080 --> 03:14:35.269 align:start position:0%
that's another piece of this it's not
stated

03:14:35.269 --> 03:14:35.279 align:start position:0%
stated
 
03:14:36.950 --> 03:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
beyond simply
 
03:14:40.309 --> 03:14:40.319 align:start position:0%
rewarding success
 
03:14:44.150 --> 03:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:46.150 --> 03:14:46.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:14:48.309 --> 03:14:48.319 align:start position:0%
so my impression of the bill initially
 
03:14:51.910 --> 03:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
was incentive um in the form of maybe a
 
03:14:53.910 --> 03:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
bonus as you mentioned
 
03:14:55.910 --> 03:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
it's a one-time payment so i personally
 
03:14:57.670 --> 03:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
don't look at it as something where you
 
03:14:59.750 --> 03:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
could hire more staff because then
 
03:15:00.870 --> 03:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
that's something that you're going to
 
03:15:02.550 --> 03:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
have to fund in the future and that's
 
03:15:05.830 --> 03:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
going to cost money to the taxpayers
 
03:15:07.670 --> 03:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
the other concern i have going back to
 
03:15:10.229 --> 03:15:10.239 align:start position:0%
this is not about school funding is i
 
03:15:11.670 --> 03:15:11.680 align:start position:0%
feel as though we continue to look at
 
03:15:14.070 --> 03:15:14.080 align:start position:0%
school funding from the standpoint of
 
03:15:16.150 --> 03:15:16.160 align:start position:0%
those that are on reduced lunch those
 
03:15:18.630 --> 03:15:18.640 align:start position:0%
english as a second language
 
03:15:20.389 --> 03:15:20.399 align:start position:0%
what about the communities that are
 
03:15:22.469 --> 03:15:22.479 align:start position:0%
predominantly middle class i feel as
 
03:15:24.389 --> 03:15:24.399 align:start position:0%
though we continue to kind of saddle
 
03:15:26.469 --> 03:15:26.479 align:start position:0%
financial burdens on them because we say
 
03:15:28.389 --> 03:15:28.399 align:start position:0%
they can handle it and somehow they make
 
03:15:29.750 --> 03:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
it happen
 
03:15:31.990 --> 03:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't mean that it's easy
 
03:15:34.550 --> 03:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
my thought is i don't understand why we
 
03:15:36.630 --> 03:15:36.640 align:start position:0%
don't give incentive and it just simply
 
03:15:38.389 --> 03:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
be a reward
 
03:15:39.590 --> 03:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
why couldn't it be something
 
03:15:41.590 --> 03:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
extracurricular that they purchased why
 
03:15:43.910 --> 03:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
couldn't it be um it would be very small
 
03:15:45.830 --> 03:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
because i don't you know like under
 
03:15:47.990 --> 03:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
equipment is expensive but why couldn't
 
03:15:49.429 --> 03:15:49.439 align:start position:0%
they put it to something like that i
 
03:15:50.790 --> 03:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
just feel as though we always have the
 
03:15:53.030 --> 03:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
rules and the strings you did a great
 
03:15:55.510 --> 03:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
job here you go you do what you see fit
 
03:15:57.110 --> 03:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
maybe it's air conditioners for the
 
03:16:00.630 --> 03:16:00.640 align:start position:0%
classrooms just you do what you do
 
03:16:02.550 --> 03:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for watching again as a
 
03:16:03.990 --> 03:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
private sponsor i'll try to try to
 
03:16:05.269 --> 03:16:05.279 align:start position:0%
respond to that
 
03:16:05.279 --> 03:16:06.070 align:start position:0%
respond to that
um

03:16:06.070 --> 03:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:16:09.670 --> 03:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
the intent of the sponsors is to
 
03:16:13.110 --> 03:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
reward achievement and just give the
 
03:16:13.120 --> 03:16:14.229 align:start position:0%
reward achievement and just give the
reward

03:16:14.229 --> 03:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
reward
 
03:16:16.950 --> 03:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
out the award and the reward to the
 
03:16:19.910 --> 03:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
district to do whatever they want to
 
03:16:22.070 --> 03:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
whatever they want with with absolutely
 
03:16:22.080 --> 03:16:23.110 align:start position:0%
whatever they want with with absolutely
uh

03:16:23.110 --> 03:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:16:25.110 --> 03:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
no or minimal strings of tests if they
 
03:16:27.510 --> 03:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
want to i mean they
 
03:16:30.150 --> 03:16:30.160 align:start position:0%
that's in local control if the district
 
03:16:31.750 --> 03:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
qualifies for award then they get the
 
03:16:33.269 --> 03:16:33.279 align:start position:0%
award and they decide what to do with it
 
03:16:36.710 --> 03:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
that's my vision of it as a sponsor does
 
03:16:41.830 --> 03:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:44.630 --> 03:16:44.640 align:start position:0%
representative olson uh thank you uh
 
03:16:46.870 --> 03:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
just to kind of to generally look at
 
03:16:46.880 --> 03:16:47.750 align:start position:0%
just to kind of to generally look at
this

03:16:47.750 --> 03:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:16:47.760 --> 03:16:48.790 align:start position:0%
this
uh

03:16:48.790 --> 03:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:16:51.429 --> 03:16:51.439 align:start position:0%
i i i'm against the bill as it's written
 
03:16:53.910 --> 03:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
uh i i'm not in favor of having the
 
03:16:55.910 --> 03:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
department of education determine what
 
03:16:58.469 --> 03:16:58.479 align:start position:0%
sort of formula would be used even in
 
03:17:01.590 --> 03:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
conjunction with other people
 
03:17:03.110 --> 03:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
i've been pretty consistent on this
 
03:17:04.710 --> 03:17:04.720 align:start position:0%
committee with
 
03:17:07.190 --> 03:17:07.200 align:start position:0%
funding bills for for education
 
03:17:08.870 --> 03:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
and wanting to know who's going to get
 
03:17:10.309 --> 03:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
money when it goes through if it's
 
03:17:13.030 --> 03:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
approved this is one where we don't know
 
03:17:15.190 --> 03:17:15.200 align:start position:0%
and it would have the potential
 
03:17:15.200 --> 03:17:16.950 align:start position:0%
and it would have the potential
of

03:17:16.950 --> 03:17:16.960 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:17:19.670 --> 03:17:19.680 align:start position:0%
sending grants to wolfeboro rye hanover
 
03:17:21.510 --> 03:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
waterville valley
 
03:17:23.510 --> 03:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
because that's the way it came out when
 
03:17:27.030 --> 03:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
they ran the ran the data and
 
03:17:28.790 --> 03:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
i'd be much happier if it came out
 
03:17:31.510 --> 03:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
pittsfield claremont berlin and franklin
 
03:17:31.520 --> 03:17:33.030 align:start position:0%
pittsfield claremont berlin and franklin
uh

03:17:33.030 --> 03:17:33.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:17:35.750 --> 03:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
i think we need to be very very careful
 
03:17:37.349 --> 03:17:37.359 align:start position:0%
in using the wording that i've heard
 
03:17:39.750 --> 03:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
today that we would be rewarding those
 
03:17:41.750 --> 03:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
schools that have low scores
 
03:17:44.150 --> 03:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
that is a disservice to school districts
 
03:17:45.990 --> 03:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
with the disservice to students the
 
03:17:48.150 --> 03:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
service to teachers in a number of
 
03:17:49.910 --> 03:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
school districts in this state
 
03:17:52.070 --> 03:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
uh so i i
 
03:17:55.830 --> 03:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
until i can see hard data which is based
 
03:17:58.229 --> 03:17:58.239 align:start position:0%
on what you've said miss mr chairman's
 
03:17:59.910 --> 03:17:59.920 align:start position:0%
down the road because that hasn't been
 
03:18:02.550 --> 03:18:02.560 align:start position:0%
developed uh i would not be in favor of
 
03:18:06.070 --> 03:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
removing this piece of legislation
 
03:18:08.790 --> 03:18:08.800 align:start position:0%
sure the the criteria that's a very fair
 
03:18:10.710 --> 03:18:10.720 align:start position:0%
question this came up uh earlier in the
 
03:18:12.469 --> 03:18:12.479 align:start position:0%
hearing and exec session what would the
 
03:18:14.790 --> 03:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
criteria be one of the notes that i took
 
03:18:16.550 --> 03:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
from the earlier discussion in this
 
03:18:16.560 --> 03:18:17.429 align:start position:0%
from the earlier discussion in this
measure

03:18:17.429 --> 03:18:17.439 align:start position:0%
measure
 
03:18:19.190 --> 03:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
uh had to do with who would determine
 
03:18:21.590 --> 03:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
the criteria
 
03:18:25.110 --> 03:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
and the cr the cr should some version of
 
03:18:27.750 --> 03:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
this move forward somehow someday
 
03:18:31.110 --> 03:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
uh that's a great question and
 
03:18:34.790 --> 03:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
my is a one of the early sponsors
 
03:18:36.630 --> 03:18:36.640 align:start position:0%
i hear that and i agree with that
 
03:18:36.640 --> 03:18:37.830 align:start position:0%
i hear that and i agree with that
concern

03:18:37.830 --> 03:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
concern
 
03:18:37.840 --> 03:18:39.590 align:start position:0%
concern
uh

03:18:39.590 --> 03:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:18:42.309 --> 03:18:42.319 align:start position:0%
i want to be careful about trying to put
 
03:18:44.550 --> 03:18:44.560 align:start position:0%
too much in the statute in terms of who
 
03:18:46.550 --> 03:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
the stakeholders are
 
03:18:47.670 --> 03:18:47.680 align:start position:0%
that would
 
03:18:50.710 --> 03:18:50.720 align:start position:0%
work with doe to establish a criteria
 
03:18:50.720 --> 03:18:51.830 align:start position:0%
work with doe to establish a criteria
that

03:18:51.830 --> 03:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:18:51.840 --> 03:18:53.910 align:start position:0%
that
works

03:18:53.910 --> 03:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
works
 
03:18:55.510 --> 03:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
you know the school board association
 
03:18:59.349 --> 03:18:59.359 align:start position:0%
the municipal association the uh
 
03:19:01.110 --> 03:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
school administrators
 
03:19:03.190 --> 03:19:03.200 align:start position:0%
you know who who should
 
03:19:05.030 --> 03:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
be involved with that and if
 
03:19:06.469 --> 03:19:06.479 align:start position:0%
in my thinking is if you get too
 
03:19:09.830 --> 03:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
prescriptive trying to stat in statute
 
03:19:09.840 --> 03:19:10.870 align:start position:0%
prescriptive trying to stat in statute
uh

03:19:10.870 --> 03:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:19:12.710 --> 03:19:12.720 align:start position:0%
say who's going to help determine the
 
03:19:15.990 --> 03:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
criteria to me it's a it's a little
 
03:19:19.830 --> 03:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
cleaner and simpler if this
 
03:19:21.830 --> 03:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
were to move forward in some fashion
 
03:19:21.840 --> 03:19:23.429 align:start position:0%
were to move forward in some fashion
to

03:19:23.429 --> 03:19:23.439 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:19:26.950 --> 03:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
trust doe and give them a fund and say
 
03:19:29.110 --> 03:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
we trust that you will communicate with
 
03:19:31.269 --> 03:19:31.279 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and you'll develop the
 
03:19:34.309 --> 03:19:34.319 align:start position:0%
criteria you know here's an account and
 
03:19:38.229 --> 03:19:38.239 align:start position:0%
here's some some funds for you to
 
03:19:39.990 --> 03:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
reward success with according to a
 
03:19:42.389 --> 03:19:42.399 align:start position:0%
criteria that we trust you to develop i
 
03:19:45.590 --> 03:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
don't know how else to put that
 
03:19:47.110 --> 03:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
but that's a kind of a short answer
 
03:19:49.030 --> 03:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
representative tanner
 
03:19:49.040 --> 03:19:49.910 align:start position:0%
representative tanner
um

03:19:49.910 --> 03:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:19:52.229 --> 03:19:52.239 align:start position:0%
yeah i've talked in the past about the
 
03:19:53.990 --> 03:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
intrinsic value of
 
03:19:56.469 --> 03:19:56.479 align:start position:0%
of awards that that schools and teachers
 
03:19:57.510 --> 03:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
now get
 
03:19:57.520 --> 03:19:58.469 align:start position:0%
now get
and

03:19:58.469 --> 03:19:58.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:20:01.510 --> 03:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
there is a whole setup to reward
 
03:20:03.590 --> 03:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
teacher the teacher of the year and
 
03:20:05.910 --> 03:20:05.920 align:start position:0%
runners up in in new hampshire as well
 
03:20:08.710 --> 03:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
as award the top elementary middle and
 
03:20:11.590 --> 03:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
high schools and their runners-up
 
03:20:14.070 --> 03:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
and it's a it's a fair system where
 
03:20:15.590 --> 03:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
there are people on
 
03:20:17.510 --> 03:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
on the committee that represent various
 
03:20:20.229 --> 03:20:20.239 align:start position:0%
parts um and it's not necessarily tied
 
03:20:21.510 --> 03:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
to a government
 
03:20:23.590 --> 03:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
uh department um
 
03:20:27.110 --> 03:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
i think that if the rewards monetary
 
03:20:28.790 --> 03:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
rewards were somehow
 
03:20:32.229 --> 03:20:32.239 align:start position:0%
tied to perhaps those intrinsic rewards
 
03:20:35.510 --> 03:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
i would be more inclined to to
 
03:20:37.429 --> 03:20:37.439 align:start position:0%
vote for something like this the other
 
03:20:39.510 --> 03:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
issue that i have is that this is one
 
03:20:41.349 --> 03:20:41.359 align:start position:0%
million dollars to the department of
 
03:20:41.359 --> 03:20:42.550 align:start position:0%
million dollars to the department of
education

03:20:42.550 --> 03:20:42.560 align:start position:0%
education
 
03:20:42.560 --> 03:20:43.990 align:start position:0%
education
non-lapsing

03:20:43.990 --> 03:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing
 
03:20:47.110 --> 03:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
with little or no accountability
 
03:20:49.349 --> 03:20:49.359 align:start position:0%
and once again i don't think we should
 
03:20:51.269 --> 03:20:51.279 align:start position:0%
be spending government money
 
03:20:53.429 --> 03:20:53.439 align:start position:0%
without a lot of accountability on it
 
03:20:56.790 --> 03:20:56.800 align:start position:0%
and particularly to um
 
03:20:58.950 --> 03:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
you know whether you say it's a trust
 
03:21:02.309 --> 03:21:02.319 align:start position:0%
issue um i i want it down in writing
 
03:21:04.309 --> 03:21:04.319 align:start position:0%
what what's actually going to happen and
 
03:21:07.110 --> 03:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
and all these intrinsic awards have
 
03:21:09.750 --> 03:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
a well-rounded policy on how they
 
03:21:12.309 --> 03:21:12.319 align:start position:0%
determine it the governor's wife is on
 
03:21:15.349 --> 03:21:15.359 align:start position:0%
the teacher of the year
 
03:21:17.190 --> 03:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
committee and and
 
03:21:19.349 --> 03:21:19.359 align:start position:0%
speaks highly of their
 
03:21:20.950 --> 03:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
insight where they go to schools and
 
03:21:23.190 --> 03:21:23.200 align:start position:0%
they actually see what's happening and
 
03:21:25.110 --> 03:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
you know they make some judgments about
 
03:21:25.120 --> 03:21:25.990 align:start position:0%
you know they make some judgments about
um

03:21:25.990 --> 03:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:29.030 --> 03:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
with all the data as well um so i would
 
03:21:31.590 --> 03:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
just say that if you're if you're going
 
03:21:33.190 --> 03:21:33.200 align:start position:0%
to do something like this just don't
 
03:21:34.630 --> 03:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
throw money
 
03:21:36.790 --> 03:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
um and particularly in a one million
 
03:21:38.950 --> 03:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
dollar fund that's non-lapsing when you
 
03:21:40.550 --> 03:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
don't have any criteria and you don't
 
03:21:41.590 --> 03:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
have any
 
03:21:43.349 --> 03:21:43.359 align:start position:0%
committee and that sort of thing
 
03:21:45.349 --> 03:21:45.359 align:start position:0%
thank you sure well obviously there
 
03:21:47.510 --> 03:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
would be criteria to develop of course
 
03:21:48.790 --> 03:21:48.800 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
03:21:49.990 --> 03:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
03:21:51.830 --> 03:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
determined um
 
03:21:53.510 --> 03:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
and this would as i said as a sponsor
 
03:21:55.349 --> 03:21:55.359 align:start position:0%
see it uh representative this would be
 
03:21:57.510 --> 03:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
new money okay so
 
03:21:59.590 --> 03:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
one question that inevitably would come
 
03:22:02.389 --> 03:22:02.399 align:start position:0%
to someone who would would express some
 
03:22:04.229 --> 03:22:04.239 align:start position:0%
of your your sentiments would be you
 
03:22:07.110 --> 03:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
know why would you not want to
 
03:22:09.990 --> 03:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
find some new money to uh however much
 
03:22:10.000 --> 03:22:10.710 align:start position:0%
find some new money to uh however much
or

03:22:10.710 --> 03:22:10.720 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:22:14.309 --> 03:22:14.319 align:start position:0%
or little to uh make available to to to
 
03:22:14.319 --> 03:22:15.429 align:start position:0%
or little to uh make available to to to
schools

03:22:15.429 --> 03:22:15.439 align:start position:0%
schools
 
03:22:18.070 --> 03:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
that's one thought
 
03:22:18.080 --> 03:22:18.790 align:start position:0%
that's one thought
the

03:22:18.790 --> 03:22:18.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:22:20.469 --> 03:22:20.479 align:start position:0%
teacher of the year
 
03:22:23.429 --> 03:22:23.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:25.510 --> 03:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
those are uh
 
03:22:27.750 --> 03:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
well intended and wonderful
 
03:22:30.150 --> 03:22:30.160 align:start position:0%
uh very subjective as you all know i
 
03:22:30.160 --> 03:22:32.150 align:start position:0%
uh very subjective as you all know i
mean

03:22:32.150 --> 03:22:32.160 align:start position:0%
mean
 
03:22:34.630 --> 03:22:34.640 align:start position:0%
there's great subjectivity to so many
 
03:22:36.309 --> 03:22:36.319 align:start position:0%
awards i mean um
 
03:22:37.190 --> 03:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
if you
 
03:22:38.790 --> 03:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
whether it's all-star teams or national
 
03:22:41.910 --> 03:22:41.920 align:start position:0%
honor society or whatever recognitions
 
03:22:43.510 --> 03:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
um there's a large degree of
 
03:22:45.990 --> 03:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
subjectivity in in those
 
03:22:47.349 --> 03:22:47.359 align:start position:0%
the thing about
 
03:22:50.790 --> 03:22:50.800 align:start position:0%
having a criteria in metrics actually
 
03:22:53.670 --> 03:22:53.680 align:start position:0%
that takes out a lot of the subjectivity
 
03:22:57.349 --> 03:22:57.359 align:start position:0%
and allows the award to be
 
03:23:00.070 --> 03:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
granted strictly on the numbers rather
 
03:23:02.550 --> 03:23:02.560 align:start position:0%
than on you know politics of who knows
 
03:23:03.990 --> 03:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
who or who you know you mentioned the
 
03:23:05.990 --> 03:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
governor's wife or whatever
 
03:23:07.830 --> 03:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
so that's another uh
 
03:23:10.710 --> 03:23:10.720 align:start position:0%
piece of this puzzle is is having some
 
03:23:13.349 --> 03:23:13.359 align:start position:0%
some metrics as opposed to you know and
 
03:23:15.349 --> 03:23:15.359 align:start position:0%
i want to make another point i know your
 
03:23:17.349 --> 03:23:17.359 align:start position:0%
hand is up uh
 
03:23:19.110 --> 03:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
when this came up before
 
03:23:21.510 --> 03:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
at some point someone mentioned um
 
03:23:23.990 --> 03:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
merit pay and and i this is not about
 
03:23:27.269 --> 03:23:27.279 align:start position:0%
merit pay um i i have problem i mean i
 
03:23:29.349 --> 03:23:29.359 align:start position:0%
love the concept of merit pay
 
03:23:31.910 --> 03:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
but having been
 
03:23:33.670 --> 03:23:33.680 align:start position:0%
like most of you been in the world of
 
03:23:35.349 --> 03:23:35.359 align:start position:0%
education that's a very difficult thing
 
03:23:37.830 --> 03:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
to do this is not about teacher merit
 
03:23:40.710 --> 03:23:40.720 align:start position:0%
pay this is about strictly identifying
 
03:23:42.309 --> 03:23:42.319 align:start position:0%
improvement and acknowledging and
 
03:23:44.389 --> 03:23:44.399 align:start position:0%
rewarding it
 
03:23:47.590 --> 03:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
uh may i just respond since you said you
 
03:23:49.190 --> 03:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
couldn't understand why i wouldn't want
 
03:23:52.309 --> 03:23:52.319 align:start position:0%
to put more money in certification i do
 
03:23:54.150 --> 03:23:54.160 align:start position:0%
want to put more money into education
 
03:23:56.790 --> 03:23:56.800 align:start position:0%
but again you're you're just throwing
 
03:24:00.870 --> 03:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
money out to a million dollars
 
03:24:03.030 --> 03:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
to the department of education
 
03:24:05.990 --> 03:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing and again it's it's
 
03:24:09.510 --> 03:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
the the subjectivity
 
03:24:09.520 --> 03:24:10.389 align:start position:0%
the the subjectivity
in

03:24:10.389 --> 03:24:10.399 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:24:13.030 --> 03:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
the teacher of the year award um i think
 
03:24:14.550 --> 03:24:14.560 align:start position:0%
if you talk to the people on that
 
03:24:16.550 --> 03:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
committee it would not be
 
03:24:19.030 --> 03:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
political it would not be
 
03:24:21.590 --> 03:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
subjective it takes in people making
 
03:24:25.590 --> 03:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
recommendations it takes in a lot of uh
 
03:24:28.710 --> 03:24:28.720 align:start position:0%
other things it's just like the the um
 
03:24:31.510 --> 03:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
krista mcauliffe uh scholarship
 
03:24:34.550 --> 03:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
um but it they also have criteria for
 
03:24:36.950 --> 03:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
schools and there's a lot of components
 
03:24:39.269 --> 03:24:39.279 align:start position:0%
on we talked about this with every
 
03:24:41.830 --> 03:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
student succeeds that you know the
 
03:24:44.150 --> 03:24:44.160 align:start position:0%
measure of a school is not just their
 
03:24:46.710 --> 03:24:46.720 align:start position:0%
test scores but it's their growth it's
 
03:24:48.950 --> 03:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
their graduation rate it's a lot of
 
03:24:48.960 --> 03:24:49.750 align:start position:0%
their graduation rate it's a lot of
other

03:24:49.750 --> 03:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
other
 
03:24:49.760 --> 03:24:51.190 align:start position:0%
other
um

03:24:51.190 --> 03:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:24:53.830 --> 03:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
really uh metrics that you can that you
 
03:24:55.030 --> 03:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
can point to
 
03:24:55.040 --> 03:24:55.910 align:start position:0%
can point to
i

03:24:55.910 --> 03:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:24:58.630 --> 03:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
in order to be a good
 
03:25:02.469 --> 03:25:02.479 align:start position:0%
steward of taxpayer money i want to know
 
03:25:04.950 --> 03:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
the metrics and i want to know who's
 
03:25:07.110 --> 03:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
going to be actually on that committee
 
03:25:09.510 --> 03:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
before i throw the million dollars that
 
03:25:12.150 --> 03:25:12.160 align:start position:0%
way thank you
 
03:25:15.510 --> 03:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
sure thank you and the million dollars
 
03:25:17.349 --> 03:25:17.359 align:start position:0%
was what was in the
 
03:25:17.359 --> 03:25:18.389 align:start position:0%
was what was in the
original

03:25:18.389 --> 03:25:18.399 align:start position:0%
original
 
03:25:18.399 --> 03:25:19.990 align:start position:0%
original
measure

03:25:19.990 --> 03:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
measure
 
03:25:21.030 --> 03:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
it could
 
03:25:23.750 --> 03:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
that's a nice round figure it could be
 
03:25:25.190 --> 03:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
two million
 
03:25:27.910 --> 03:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
more i i that's something for future
 
03:25:30.150 --> 03:25:30.160 align:start position:0%
future discussion personally i'd like to
 
03:25:30.160 --> 03:25:31.110 align:start position:0%
future discussion personally i'd like to
see

03:25:31.110 --> 03:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
see
 
03:25:34.550 --> 03:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
more than that if but uh
 
03:25:35.990 --> 03:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with a million numbers for
 
03:25:39.670 --> 03:25:39.680 align:start position:0%
for i mean a million dollars for
 
03:25:41.269 --> 03:25:41.279 align:start position:0%
for now given that was what was in the
 
03:25:45.110 --> 03:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
original measure representative hobson
 
03:25:47.510 --> 03:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
thank you um i wanted to ask rep tanner
 
03:25:48.830 --> 03:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
a question
 
03:25:48.840 --> 03:25:50.550 align:start position:0%
a question
um

03:25:50.550 --> 03:25:50.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:53.110 --> 03:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
so you mentioned um intrinsic awards and
 
03:25:54.870 --> 03:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
i was wondering if you could describe
 
03:25:57.990 --> 03:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
what an intrinsic award is uh sure i
 
03:26:00.550 --> 03:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
have another part two part two
 
03:26:04.389 --> 03:26:04.399 align:start position:0%
would you be agreeable to a committee of
 
03:26:07.990 --> 03:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
stakeholders like when i was on the um
 
03:26:10.710 --> 03:26:10.720 align:start position:0%
drinking water commission we award money
 
03:26:12.790 --> 03:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
to districts in need
 
03:26:14.389 --> 03:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
as long as they can show
 
03:26:16.389 --> 03:26:16.399 align:start position:0%
you know xyz
 
03:26:18.309 --> 03:26:18.319 align:start position:0%
we've got the
 
03:26:20.070 --> 03:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner we've got members of the
 
03:26:22.710 --> 03:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
committee we've got other stakeholders
 
03:26:24.389 --> 03:26:24.399 align:start position:0%
throughout the drinking water
 
03:26:26.870 --> 03:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
establishment would would that kind of a
 
03:26:29.429 --> 03:26:29.439 align:start position:0%
committee that goes through the awards
 
03:26:29.439 --> 03:26:30.309 align:start position:0%
committee that goes through the awards
um

03:26:30.309 --> 03:26:30.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:26:32.150 --> 03:26:32.160 align:start position:0%
whatever they be would that be something
 
03:26:34.150 --> 03:26:34.160 align:start position:0%
that if was added to this bill could you
 
03:26:35.670 --> 03:26:35.680 align:start position:0%
support it
 
03:26:37.670 --> 03:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
thank you um for asking that question
 
03:26:40.550 --> 03:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
one the intrinsic rewards are right now
 
03:26:42.469 --> 03:26:42.479 align:start position:0%
for example the
 
03:26:43.590 --> 03:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
the um
 
03:26:45.910 --> 03:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
elementary in my district grantham
 
03:26:48.309 --> 03:26:48.319 align:start position:0%
elementary received the elementary
 
03:26:49.910 --> 03:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
school award
 
03:26:51.910 --> 03:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
um they received a
 
03:26:53.910 --> 03:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
commendation from the department of
 
03:26:53.920 --> 03:26:55.429 align:start position:0%
commendation from the department of
education

03:26:55.429 --> 03:26:55.439 align:start position:0%
education
 
03:26:58.229 --> 03:26:58.239 align:start position:0%
that was it okay
 
03:27:00.229 --> 03:27:00.239 align:start position:0%
and they did a lot of hard work for that
 
03:27:02.070 --> 03:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
um and the same thing with the teacher
 
03:27:03.510 --> 03:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
of the year award
 
03:27:06.150 --> 03:27:06.160 align:start position:0%
it's intrinsic because it's in name only
 
03:27:07.349 --> 03:27:07.359 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
03:27:08.950 --> 03:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
you get it but you have to go through a
 
03:27:11.030 --> 03:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
lot of hoops to get to it that's what
 
03:27:13.590 --> 03:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
intrinsic award is or if you're on a
 
03:27:15.830 --> 03:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
basketball team and you win division one
 
03:27:16.950 --> 03:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
you get
 
03:27:16.960 --> 03:27:17.910 align:start position:0%
you get
little

03:27:17.910 --> 03:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
little
 
03:27:20.309 --> 03:27:20.319 align:start position:0%
um charms that say that you're a state
 
03:27:20.319 --> 03:27:21.670 align:start position:0%
um charms that say that you're a state
championship

03:27:21.670 --> 03:27:21.680 align:start position:0%
championship
 
03:27:24.469 --> 03:27:24.479 align:start position:0%
team and that's intrinsic that that is
 
03:27:24.479 --> 03:27:25.750 align:start position:0%
team and that's intrinsic that that is
enough

03:27:25.750 --> 03:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
enough
 
03:27:29.429 --> 03:27:29.439 align:start position:0%
of a reward for those people um to feel
 
03:27:31.830 --> 03:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
very special about what they do okay and
 
03:27:34.309 --> 03:27:34.319 align:start position:0%
in education
 
03:27:35.910 --> 03:27:35.920 align:start position:0%
most teachers don't go into education
 
03:27:40.070 --> 03:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
thinking they're going to be rich okay
 
03:27:42.630 --> 03:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
and they go into it because they feel a
 
03:27:45.750 --> 03:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
calling or they feel uh the reward is is
 
03:27:48.309 --> 03:27:48.319 align:start position:0%
intrinsic to the job that you have
 
03:27:48.319 --> 03:27:49.190 align:start position:0%
intrinsic to the job that you have
um

03:27:49.190 --> 03:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:27:50.950 --> 03:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
and you like to have enough money to
 
03:27:53.190 --> 03:27:53.200 align:start position:0%
have a decent you know car and living
 
03:27:54.630 --> 03:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
and that sort of thing
 
03:27:57.269 --> 03:27:57.279 align:start position:0%
your committee that you had
 
03:27:58.469 --> 03:27:58.479 align:start position:0%
faced there
 
03:28:01.429 --> 03:28:01.439 align:start position:0%
it sounded like base their rewards on
 
03:28:01.439 --> 03:28:02.790 align:start position:0%
it sounded like base their rewards on
need

03:28:02.790 --> 03:28:02.800 align:start position:0%
need
 
03:28:02.800 --> 03:28:03.830 align:start position:0%
need
and

03:28:03.830 --> 03:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:28:05.269 --> 03:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
i am
 
03:28:07.349 --> 03:28:07.359 align:start position:0%
one thousand percent
 
03:28:10.469 --> 03:28:10.479 align:start position:0%
in giving rewards and giving extra money
 
03:28:13.190 --> 03:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
to school districts based on need that's
 
03:28:15.190 --> 03:28:15.200 align:start position:0%
not what this this bill is about this
 
03:28:16.950 --> 03:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
bill is about giving this department of
 
03:28:21.269 --> 03:28:21.279 align:start position:0%
education 100 or million dollars
 
03:28:22.870 --> 03:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
without knowing how they're going to
 
03:28:24.550 --> 03:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
spend it or how they're going to dole it
 
03:28:24.560 --> 03:28:25.750 align:start position:0%
spend it or how they're going to dole it
out

03:28:25.750 --> 03:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
out
 
03:28:27.510 --> 03:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
with only the instruction that we want
 
03:28:29.030 --> 03:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
it to reward
 
03:28:29.040 --> 03:28:30.150 align:start position:0%
it to reward
um

03:28:30.150 --> 03:28:30.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:28:32.150 --> 03:28:32.160 align:start position:0%
you know positive
 
03:28:34.389 --> 03:28:34.399 align:start position:0%
things or high achievement
 
03:28:36.070 --> 03:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
not necessarily high
 
03:28:39.030 --> 03:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
high growth or whatever and as
 
03:28:41.990 --> 03:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
representative ellison said um
 
03:28:44.150 --> 03:28:44.160 align:start position:0%
my guess is it's going to go to hanover
 
03:28:44.160 --> 03:28:45.030 align:start position:0%
my guess is it's going to go to hanover
and

03:28:45.030 --> 03:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:28:46.389 --> 03:28:46.399 align:start position:0%
wolfeboro and
 
03:28:48.790 --> 03:28:48.800 align:start position:0%
you know the the schools that we already
 
03:28:51.269 --> 03:28:51.279 align:start position:0%
know from the commission report
 
03:28:52.710 --> 03:28:52.720 align:start position:0%
have a
 
03:28:52.720 --> 03:28:53.750 align:start position:0%
have a
high

03:28:53.750 --> 03:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
high
 
03:28:53.760 --> 03:28:54.790 align:start position:0%
high
base

03:28:54.790 --> 03:28:54.800 align:start position:0%
base
 
03:28:56.710 --> 03:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
sunapee the town that i represent has a
 
03:28:56.720 --> 03:28:57.990 align:start position:0%
sunapee the town that i represent has a
high

03:28:57.990 --> 03:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
high
 
03:29:00.469 --> 03:29:00.479 align:start position:0%
base and and we're able to support our
 
03:29:02.870 --> 03:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
students to the max
 
03:29:02.880 --> 03:29:04.229 align:start position:0%
students to the max
so

03:29:04.229 --> 03:29:04.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:29:07.429 --> 03:29:07.439 align:start position:0%
and and yet the berlin berlin say it
 
03:29:10.070 --> 03:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
wrong berlin and franklin and those
 
03:29:13.110 --> 03:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
schools that need it based on need
 
03:29:15.750 --> 03:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
um but also maybe have made tremendous
 
03:29:15.760 --> 03:29:16.710 align:start position:0%
um but also maybe have made tremendous
growth

03:29:16.710 --> 03:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
growth
 
03:29:18.550 --> 03:29:18.560 align:start position:0%
would be a great recipient for something
 
03:29:20.950 --> 03:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
like that
 
03:29:22.950 --> 03:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
sure right
 
03:29:25.750 --> 03:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for that i appreciate that um
 
03:29:27.190 --> 03:29:27.200 align:start position:0%
back and forth
 
03:29:28.950 --> 03:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
the other thing that i don't know if
 
03:29:30.950 --> 03:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
we've talked about and i don't remember
 
03:29:32.389 --> 03:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
if it was in the other you know one of
 
03:29:34.790 --> 03:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
the other hearings this seems to be the
 
03:29:37.349 --> 03:29:37.359 align:start position:0%
never-ending discussion um
 
03:29:39.349 --> 03:29:39.359 align:start position:0%
but i thought we were talking about
 
03:29:41.910 --> 03:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
rewards like uh like a field trip or a
 
03:29:43.590 --> 03:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
field day or just money that you could
 
03:29:45.190 --> 03:29:45.200 align:start position:0%
use for
 
03:29:45.200 --> 03:29:46.070 align:start position:0%
use for
fun

03:29:46.070 --> 03:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
fun
 
03:29:49.750 --> 03:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
um and even in you know a i guess a
 
03:29:51.990 --> 03:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
quote successful district
 
03:29:52.000 --> 03:29:52.870 align:start position:0%
quote successful district
um

03:29:52.870 --> 03:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:29:55.030 --> 03:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
you know i know these kids aren't aren't
 
03:29:57.030 --> 03:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
having any fun they're not going places
 
03:29:59.429 --> 03:29:59.439 align:start position:0%
they're not going on field trips um
 
03:30:01.190 --> 03:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
maybe they're coming to the state house
 
03:30:03.910 --> 03:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
but i'm not hearing a lot of uh that
 
03:30:05.750 --> 03:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
kind of reward so
 
03:30:08.469 --> 03:30:08.479 align:start position:0%
just if anybody would want to talk about
 
03:30:10.630 --> 03:30:10.640 align:start position:0%
you know could this be an opportunity
 
03:30:13.349 --> 03:30:13.359 align:start position:0%
for kids to experience something outside
 
03:30:17.670 --> 03:30:17.680 align:start position:0%
of the budget that's really it
 
03:30:19.510 --> 03:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
to go back to what i said earlier to i
 
03:30:20.950 --> 03:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
think to your point
 
03:30:22.950 --> 03:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
uh or some version of this to move
 
03:30:25.349 --> 03:30:25.359 align:start position:0%
forward then if the school suddenly had
 
03:30:28.150 --> 03:30:28.160 align:start position:0%
uh a fifty thousand dollar award because
 
03:30:28.160 --> 03:30:28.830 align:start position:0%
uh a fifty thousand dollar award because
of

03:30:28.830 --> 03:30:28.840 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:30:31.590 --> 03:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
uh showing improvement in a standardized
 
03:30:33.190 --> 03:30:33.200 align:start position:0%
test score they could you take that
 
03:30:34.870 --> 03:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollars and actually do
 
03:30:34.880 --> 03:30:35.750 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollars and actually do
quite

03:30:35.750 --> 03:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
quite
 
03:30:37.750 --> 03:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
you know they could do fifty if a field
 
03:30:39.510 --> 03:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
trip was a thousand blocks they could do
 
03:30:41.830 --> 03:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
fifty field trips if they wanted that's
 
03:30:44.710 --> 03:30:44.720 align:start position:0%
one way that i look at it i also want to
 
03:30:46.630 --> 03:30:46.640 align:start position:0%
follow up on
 
03:30:49.110 --> 03:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
the notion that the hanovers would be
 
03:30:50.550 --> 03:30:50.560 align:start position:0%
the ones that would
 
03:30:52.710 --> 03:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
most benefit from this again going back
 
03:30:54.790 --> 03:30:54.800 align:start position:0%
to the the hearing
 
03:30:57.030 --> 03:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
the intent of this would be
 
03:31:00.070 --> 03:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
to schools would have whatever
 
03:31:02.550 --> 03:31:02.560 align:start position:0%
assessment was identified as the
 
03:31:04.309 --> 03:31:04.319 align:start position:0%
assessment that would be the basis for
 
03:31:05.830 --> 03:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
the criteria
 
03:31:07.910 --> 03:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
schools would be competing only against
 
03:31:07.920 --> 03:31:09.429 align:start position:0%
schools would be competing only against
themselves

03:31:09.429 --> 03:31:09.439 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
03:31:11.190 --> 03:31:11.200 align:start position:0%
so the
 
03:31:12.790 --> 03:31:12.800 align:start position:0%
whatever their baseline is if they
 
03:31:14.229 --> 03:31:14.239 align:start position:0%
improve it by
 
03:31:16.229 --> 03:31:16.239 align:start position:0%
the criteria they improve by 10
 
03:31:18.710 --> 03:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
investments decided then they get an
 
03:31:18.720 --> 03:31:19.670 align:start position:0%
investments decided then they get an
award

03:31:19.670 --> 03:31:19.680 align:start position:0%
award
 
03:31:19.680 --> 03:31:20.950 align:start position:0%
award
uh

03:31:20.950 --> 03:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:31:22.229 --> 03:31:22.239 align:start position:0%
i don't know what the threshold will be
 
03:31:23.910 --> 03:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
that's to be determined i don't think we
 
03:31:25.910 --> 03:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
in this work session or in the committee
 
03:31:28.070 --> 03:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
as a whole should get in the weeds and
 
03:31:30.309 --> 03:31:30.319 align:start position:0%
get too prescriptive other than to make
 
03:31:30.319 --> 03:31:31.590 align:start position:0%
get too prescriptive other than to make
some

03:31:31.590 --> 03:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
some
 
03:31:34.469 --> 03:31:34.479 align:start position:0%
funding and support available for doe to
 
03:31:37.349 --> 03:31:37.359 align:start position:0%
establish criteria to reward success now
 
03:31:39.750 --> 03:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
if if the school is a low base in fact i
 
03:31:41.510 --> 03:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
think representative tanner i think it's
 
03:31:43.429 --> 03:31:43.439 align:start position:0%
kind of the opposite of what you kind of
 
03:31:45.750 --> 03:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
were alluding to with hanover
 
03:31:49.349 --> 03:31:49.359 align:start position:0%
hanover if their baseline is fairly high
 
03:31:50.870 --> 03:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
because they're a higher performing
 
03:31:53.590 --> 03:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
school for them to get that 10
 
03:31:55.510 --> 03:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
improvement would be much harder for
 
03:31:57.750 --> 03:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
hanover than say the
 
03:32:00.950 --> 03:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
picker school clermont if claremont or
 
03:32:03.030 --> 03:32:03.040 align:start position:0%
berlin or whoever if their initial
 
03:32:05.750 --> 03:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
baseline is lower it's much easier for
 
03:32:07.510 --> 03:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
the poor performing school to get that
 
03:32:10.389 --> 03:32:10.399 align:start position:0%
10 in fact this came up in committee
 
03:32:13.750 --> 03:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
hearing uh it's much
 
03:32:15.750 --> 03:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
harder for a higher performing school
 
03:32:18.630 --> 03:32:18.640 align:start position:0%
that's already got a high uh baseline to
 
03:32:20.710 --> 03:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
get that 10 or 20 percent so i think
 
03:32:22.710 --> 03:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
it's really kind of the the opposite
 
03:32:24.309 --> 03:32:24.319 align:start position:0%
concern from what you express i think
 
03:32:26.229 --> 03:32:26.239 align:start position:0%
it's it's the lower schools that will
 
03:32:28.550 --> 03:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
have an easier time uh
 
03:32:33.269 --> 03:32:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:35.910 --> 03:32:35.920 align:start position:0%
sure representative tanner
 
03:32:37.670 --> 03:32:37.680 align:start position:0%
schools that are like franklin and
 
03:32:41.110 --> 03:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
newport and claremont are doing
 
03:32:43.030 --> 03:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
everything that they can do to get the
 
03:32:44.870 --> 03:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
kids to improve
 
03:32:44.880 --> 03:32:46.070 align:start position:0%
kids to improve
and

03:32:46.070 --> 03:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:32:47.910 --> 03:32:47.920 align:start position:0%
they would have
 
03:32:51.510 --> 03:32:51.520 align:start position:0%
a more difficult time to do a 10 or 20
 
03:32:53.190 --> 03:32:53.200 align:start position:0%
improvement i mean you sound like it'd
 
03:32:55.670 --> 03:32:55.680 align:start position:0%
be easy for them to do it's not
 
03:32:58.630 --> 03:32:58.640 align:start position:0%
it's not easy at all if it was easy they
 
03:33:01.590 --> 03:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
would be doing it right now
 
03:33:05.110 --> 03:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
sure we're not casting any i hope i'm
 
03:33:06.710 --> 03:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
mishearing you i'm not casting any
 
03:33:10.070 --> 03:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
aspersions on any school all
 
03:33:13.030 --> 03:33:13.040 align:start position:0%
i'm saying on behalf of the sponsors
 
03:33:14.229 --> 03:33:14.239 align:start position:0%
is that
 
03:33:16.710 --> 03:33:16.720 align:start position:0%
schools would simply be com
 
03:33:18.469 --> 03:33:18.479 align:start position:0%
if some version of this move forward
 
03:33:20.389 --> 03:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
schools would be competing against their
 
03:33:20.399 --> 03:33:21.670 align:start position:0%
schools would be competing against their
own

03:33:21.670 --> 03:33:21.680 align:start position:0%
own
 
03:33:23.349 --> 03:33:23.359 align:start position:0%
baselines their own their own selves and
 
03:33:25.110 --> 03:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
those baselines are different you know
 
03:33:27.269 --> 03:33:27.279 align:start position:0%
some have hired some of laura you know
 
03:33:29.429 --> 03:33:29.439 align:start position:0%
it's it's not an issue of you know what
 
03:33:30.710 --> 03:33:30.720 align:start position:0%
schools are
 
03:33:32.790 --> 03:33:32.800 align:start position:0%
trying hard are doing now
 
03:33:36.469 --> 03:33:36.479 align:start position:0%
it's very uh metric based um it is
 
03:33:36.479 --> 03:33:39.830 align:start position:0%
it's very uh metric based um it is
proposed

03:33:39.830 --> 03:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:43.030 --> 03:33:43.040 align:start position:0%
representative hall
 
03:33:44.830 --> 03:33:44.840 align:start position:0%
okay so i'm thinking about the
 
03:33:47.510 --> 03:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
schools in regards to their test scores
 
03:33:49.750 --> 03:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
already they are doing the best and it
 
03:33:51.510 --> 03:33:51.520 align:start position:0%
kind of goes along with representative
 
03:33:53.750 --> 03:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
um tanner they're working hard to get
 
03:33:56.229 --> 03:33:56.239 align:start position:0%
their test scores up so the notion that
 
03:33:56.239 --> 03:33:57.269 align:start position:0%
their test scores up so the notion that
this

03:33:57.269 --> 03:33:57.279 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:33:59.349 --> 03:33:59.359 align:start position:0%
you know they put some money in front of
 
03:34:00.309 --> 03:34:00.319 align:start position:0%
them and you know we're going to do
 
03:34:02.870 --> 03:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
better i'm not so sure that that's
 
03:34:04.710 --> 03:34:04.720 align:start position:0%
really accurate i mean i think the
 
03:34:04.720 --> 03:34:06.469 align:start position:0%
really accurate i mean i think the
schools

03:34:06.469 --> 03:34:06.479 align:start position:0%
schools
 
03:34:08.309 --> 03:34:08.319 align:start position:0%
work to do their best on the test scores
 
03:34:10.550 --> 03:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
and sometimes you hear about people you
 
03:34:12.150 --> 03:34:12.160 align:start position:0%
know this kind of stuff ends up people
 
03:34:14.389 --> 03:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
teaching to the test god i want to do
 
03:34:16.710 --> 03:34:16.720 align:start position:0%
well on the test and that could be an
 
03:34:18.710 --> 03:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
unintended consequence
 
03:34:20.870 --> 03:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
um with something like this but i think
 
03:34:22.950 --> 03:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
the money this in this case the money
 
03:34:25.670 --> 03:34:25.680 align:start position:0%
comes after
 
03:34:28.150 --> 03:34:28.160 align:start position:0%
the increase as opposed to giving the
 
03:34:30.309 --> 03:34:30.319 align:start position:0%
money so that they do increase this is
 
03:34:31.269 --> 03:34:31.279 align:start position:0%
going to say you're going to increase
 
03:34:32.389 --> 03:34:32.399 align:start position:0%
your test scores and you're going to get
 
03:34:34.389 --> 03:34:34.399 align:start position:0%
this money then you can buy it as you
 
03:34:36.150 --> 03:34:36.160 align:start position:0%
said you can put on air conditioning or
 
03:34:37.910 --> 03:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
whatever you want i don't know just
 
03:34:39.030 --> 03:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
seems like
 
03:34:39.040 --> 03:34:40.229 align:start position:0%
seems like
um

03:34:40.229 --> 03:34:40.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:41.990 --> 03:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
i think teachers work really hard right
 
03:34:45.110 --> 03:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
now and doing their best
 
03:34:46.950 --> 03:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
oh sure i agree as i just said to rip
 
03:34:48.550 --> 03:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
center tanner i
 
03:34:50.950 --> 03:34:50.960 align:start position:0%
i don't think i or anyone is casting any
 
03:34:52.790 --> 03:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
aspersions on any district or any
 
03:34:55.269 --> 03:34:55.279 align:start position:0%
teachers not doing their their best
 
03:34:57.750 --> 03:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
but i think honestly uh
 
03:34:59.910 --> 03:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
they're what the sponsors are trying to
 
03:35:02.469 --> 03:35:02.479 align:start position:0%
do with this and other measures um i'm
 
03:35:03.670 --> 03:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
sure i
 
03:35:05.750 --> 03:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
that you've noticed that there's a
 
03:35:07.349 --> 03:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
03:35:10.790 --> 03:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
hunger on the part of many
 
03:35:10.800 --> 03:35:11.590 align:start position:0%
hunger on the part of many
or

03:35:11.590 --> 03:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:35:12.950 --> 03:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
many parents and
 
03:35:12.960 --> 03:35:13.910 align:start position:0%
many parents and
and

03:35:13.910 --> 03:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:35:16.870 --> 03:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
people who care about education
 
03:35:16.880 --> 03:35:17.750 align:start position:0%
people who care about education
to

03:35:17.750 --> 03:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:35:17.760 --> 03:35:18.950 align:start position:0%
to
see

03:35:18.950 --> 03:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
see
 
03:35:21.510 --> 03:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
a different paradigm uh it goes back to
 
03:35:23.750 --> 03:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
the very beginning when we talked about
 
03:35:23.760 --> 03:35:24.630 align:start position:0%
the very beginning when we talked about
uh

03:35:24.630 --> 03:35:24.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:35:27.590 --> 03:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
is representative luna got into the
 
03:35:29.670 --> 03:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
the school funding committee
 
03:35:31.670 --> 03:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
was rethinking it's the way you looked
 
03:35:33.750 --> 03:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
at the third grade test scores
 
03:35:35.269 --> 03:35:35.279 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:35:39.030 --> 03:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:41.590 --> 03:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
we talk about innovation and here's
 
03:35:44.870 --> 03:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
something that's a little bit innovative
 
03:35:47.910 --> 03:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
rewarding success in some fashion
 
03:35:50.150 --> 03:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
with the criteria to be determined
 
03:35:53.190 --> 03:35:53.200 align:start position:0%
so again it doesn't cast dispersions on
 
03:35:55.030 --> 03:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
and it's not intended to cast as persons
 
03:35:57.910 --> 03:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
on anyone or any school other than to
 
03:35:59.750 --> 03:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
try to
 
03:36:02.309 --> 03:36:02.319 align:start position:0%
have a new incentive
 
03:36:04.550 --> 03:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
or reward you know rewarding success as
 
03:36:07.590 --> 03:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
i've already said i do want to
 
03:36:07.600 --> 03:36:09.110 align:start position:0%
i've already said i do want to
ask

03:36:09.110 --> 03:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
ask
 
03:36:10.309 --> 03:36:10.319 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure
 
03:36:11.990 --> 03:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
we don't have everybody here in like
 
03:36:13.429 --> 03:36:13.439 align:start position:0%
with the last area
 
03:36:15.349 --> 03:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
we probably won't take a vote or try to
 
03:36:18.790 --> 03:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
take a vote but i do want to get the
 
03:36:21.590 --> 03:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
subcommittee's sense on
 
03:36:24.150 --> 03:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
if something were to move forward
 
03:36:26.229 --> 03:36:26.239 align:start position:0%
like this in some fashion someday
 
03:36:26.239 --> 03:36:27.269 align:start position:0%
like this in some fashion someday
somehow

03:36:27.269 --> 03:36:27.279 align:start position:0%
somehow
 
03:36:27.279 --> 03:36:28.070 align:start position:0%
somehow
uh

03:36:28.070 --> 03:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:36:30.950 --> 03:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
it sounded like from the hearing that
 
03:36:34.070 --> 03:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
transferring from the rainy day fund
 
03:36:37.590 --> 03:36:37.600 align:start position:0%
was not the right way to go
 
03:36:40.309 --> 03:36:40.319 align:start position:0%
representative walls pointed out during
 
03:36:41.429 --> 03:36:41.439 align:start position:0%
the hearing
 
03:36:43.830 --> 03:36:43.840 align:start position:0%
when the bill was introduced that there
 
03:36:46.150 --> 03:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
were probably issues with
 
03:36:48.070 --> 03:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
transferring money from the rainy day
 
03:36:49.670 --> 03:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
fund unless it's an emergency my
 
03:36:51.429 --> 03:36:51.439 align:start position:0%
response was
 
03:36:53.830 --> 03:36:53.840 align:start position:0%
you know we hear that education needs
 
03:36:56.229 --> 03:36:56.239 align:start position:0%
money and some call it emergency
 
03:36:57.750 --> 03:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
so that was my short answer to her but i
 
03:36:57.760 --> 03:36:58.469 align:start position:0%
so that was my short answer to her but i
think

03:36:58.469 --> 03:36:58.479 align:start position:0%
think
 
03:37:01.190 --> 03:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
uh her point was well taken
 
03:37:01.200 --> 03:37:02.790 align:start position:0%
uh her point was well taken
so

03:37:02.790 --> 03:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:37:06.150 --> 03:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
let me see if we have a consensus
 
03:37:07.510 --> 03:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
whether this shouldn't should not go
 
03:37:10.229 --> 03:37:10.239 align:start position:0%
forward that's not my question but if
 
03:37:12.150 --> 03:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
someday some version of this went
 
03:37:12.160 --> 03:37:13.269 align:start position:0%
someday some version of this went
forward

03:37:13.269 --> 03:37:13.279 align:start position:0%
forward
 
03:37:15.510 --> 03:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
do we agree that it should not come from
 
03:37:17.910 --> 03:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
the rainy day fund but it should be it
 
03:37:19.750 --> 03:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
should be a separate line item that's my
 
03:37:19.760 --> 03:37:20.950 align:start position:0%
should be a separate line item that's my
question

03:37:20.950 --> 03:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:37:22.469 --> 03:37:22.479 align:start position:0%
is it fair to
 
03:37:24.309 --> 03:37:24.319 align:start position:0%
assume that we
 
03:37:26.550 --> 03:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
all agree that the rainy day fund would
 
03:37:28.389 --> 03:37:28.399 align:start position:0%
not be the way to go
 
03:37:31.750 --> 03:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
is that is that fair to say
 
03:37:33.670 --> 03:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
is there anyone who faces i think it was
 
03:37:33.680 --> 03:37:34.790 align:start position:0%
is there anyone who faces i think it was
more

03:37:34.790 --> 03:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
more
 
03:37:34.800 --> 03:37:35.830 align:start position:0%
more
uh

03:37:35.830 --> 03:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:37:38.150 --> 03:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
the procedure to get it i mean
 
03:37:41.030 --> 03:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
it was it it wasn't where it comes from
 
03:37:44.389 --> 03:37:44.399 align:start position:0%
so much as the mechanic the process uh
 
03:37:46.870 --> 03:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
that that uh representative walls was
 
03:37:48.790 --> 03:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
speaking to is that you
 
03:37:50.229 --> 03:37:50.239 align:start position:0%
that has to go through the finance
 
03:37:52.790 --> 03:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
committee and it it also has to be you
 
03:37:55.030 --> 03:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
know the rainy day the emergency fund
 
03:37:57.110 --> 03:37:57.120 align:start position:0%
has certain requirements in order to get
 
03:37:59.349 --> 03:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
into it so we can't legislate oh just
 
03:38:01.670 --> 03:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
dump a million into the doe every year
 
03:38:03.349 --> 03:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
and let it lapse
 
03:38:05.030 --> 03:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
well you mean when you say dump it in
 
03:38:06.469 --> 03:38:06.479 align:start position:0%
you talk about
 
03:38:06.479 --> 03:38:07.670 align:start position:0%
you talk about
we

03:38:07.670 --> 03:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:38:09.349 --> 03:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
should not be
 
03:38:11.190 --> 03:38:11.200 align:start position:0%
legislating that we take money out of
 
03:38:13.830 --> 03:38:13.840 align:start position:0%
the rainy day fund for this purpose
 
03:38:15.990 --> 03:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
correct we can't
 
03:38:17.670 --> 03:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
that's right that's what that's what she
 
03:38:20.229 --> 03:38:20.239 align:start position:0%
said and i and i i just said i think she
 
03:38:22.070 --> 03:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
was onto something i think
 
03:38:24.710 --> 03:38:24.720 align:start position:0%
that you know you we can try to make the
 
03:38:27.429 --> 03:38:27.439 align:start position:0%
argument that we could do it but it's
 
03:38:29.429 --> 03:38:29.439 align:start position:0%
it sounds like that it's not the way to
 
03:38:30.630 --> 03:38:30.640 align:start position:0%
go so
 
03:38:32.469 --> 03:38:32.479 align:start position:0%
so for my notes can
 
03:38:34.150 --> 03:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
i want to put that we're all in
 
03:38:35.510 --> 03:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
agreement that
 
03:38:37.349 --> 03:38:37.359 align:start position:0%
as the bill originally came to this
 
03:38:39.189 --> 03:38:39.199 align:start position:0%
committee with the
 
03:38:41.189 --> 03:38:41.199 align:start position:0%
transfer from the rainy day fund we we
 
03:38:42.870 --> 03:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
all agree that that's not the way to go
 
03:38:47.269 --> 03:38:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:47.279 --> 03:38:48.070 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:38:48.070 --> 03:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:48.080 --> 03:38:49.349 align:start position:0%
um
yeah

03:38:49.349 --> 03:38:49.359 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:38:52.229 --> 03:38:52.239 align:start position:0%
i couldn't hear you well i'm sorry i my
 
03:38:54.389 --> 03:38:54.399 align:start position:0%
my feeling is that what mary beth said
 
03:38:56.469 --> 03:38:56.479 align:start position:0%
and she's been on finance forever is
 
03:38:58.630 --> 03:38:58.640 align:start position:0%
that you can't do it that way
 
03:39:00.389 --> 03:39:00.399 align:start position:0%
you can't just put it in a bill it's got
 
03:39:02.790 --> 03:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
a it's got to be a process
 
03:39:05.510 --> 03:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
sure so in my notes um i just want to
 
03:39:07.269 --> 03:39:07.279 align:start position:0%
make sure that that
 
03:39:08.710 --> 03:39:08.720 align:start position:0%
we're all
 
03:39:10.550 --> 03:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
in agreement that we
 
03:39:12.389 --> 03:39:12.399 align:start position:0%
agree with representative walls and
 
03:39:12.399 --> 03:39:13.349 align:start position:0%
agree with representative walls and
whoever

03:39:13.349 --> 03:39:13.359 align:start position:0%
whoever
 
03:39:13.359 --> 03:39:14.389 align:start position:0%
whoever
said

03:39:14.389 --> 03:39:14.399 align:start position:0%
said
 
03:39:16.389 --> 03:39:16.399 align:start position:0%
pointed out concerns about the way this
 
03:39:18.070 --> 03:39:18.080 align:start position:0%
was originally
 
03:39:20.830 --> 03:39:20.840 align:start position:0%
proposed that the rainy day fund
 
03:39:25.349 --> 03:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
uh that approach is is not what we
 
03:39:27.750 --> 03:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
think it works or is is
 
03:39:30.790 --> 03:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
yeah i i i i think what what uh what
 
03:39:32.630 --> 03:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
mirabeth was saying is the rainy day
 
03:39:34.710 --> 03:39:34.720 align:start position:0%
fund is not an option
 
03:39:36.469 --> 03:39:36.479 align:start position:0%
for this it's not whether we want to or
 
03:39:39.189 --> 03:39:39.199 align:start position:0%
we think it should and shouldn't be it's
 
03:39:41.269 --> 03:39:41.279 align:start position:0%
it's it's not available for this it's
 
03:39:42.790 --> 03:39:42.800 align:start position:0%
not our decision
 
03:39:44.710 --> 03:39:44.720 align:start position:0%
yeah unless you were to change the rainy
 
03:39:47.189 --> 03:39:47.199 align:start position:0%
day fund statute
 
03:39:51.030 --> 03:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
right correct so
 
03:39:52.950 --> 03:39:52.960 align:start position:0%
the the one note that i
 
03:39:54.150 --> 03:39:54.160 align:start position:0%
have a bunch of notes here i'll share
 
03:39:56.070 --> 03:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
with all of you so i'm going to put down
 
03:39:57.670 --> 03:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
that we agree that the bill is
 
03:39:59.269 --> 03:39:59.279 align:start position:0%
originally introduced calling for a
 
03:40:01.189 --> 03:40:01.199 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund transfer
 
03:40:03.110 --> 03:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
we don't recommend that
 
03:40:05.030 --> 03:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
and if this were to ever move forward it
 
03:40:07.110 --> 03:40:07.120 align:start position:0%
would have to be funded otherwise
 
03:40:07.120 --> 03:40:08.710 align:start position:0%
would have to be funded otherwise
correct

03:40:08.710 --> 03:40:08.720 align:start position:0%
correct
 
03:40:08.720 --> 03:40:10.070 align:start position:0%
correct
okay

03:40:10.070 --> 03:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:40:12.309 --> 03:40:12.319 align:start position:0%
all right good so that's
 
03:40:13.910 --> 03:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
that's a plus
 
03:40:13.920 --> 03:40:17.510 align:start position:0%
that's a plus
um

03:40:17.510 --> 03:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:20.630 --> 03:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
other thoughts on
 
03:40:23.830 --> 03:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
any aspect of this incentive grant sure
 
03:40:26.630 --> 03:40:26.640 align:start position:0%
uh richard hobson sorry i keep butting
 
03:40:28.389 --> 03:40:28.399 align:start position:0%
in uh
 
03:40:31.189 --> 03:40:31.199 align:start position:0%
i was wondering if we put restrictions
 
03:40:31.199 --> 03:40:33.750 align:start position:0%
i was wondering if we put restrictions
on

03:40:33.750 --> 03:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:40:35.269 --> 03:40:35.279 align:start position:0%
you could only
 
03:40:38.229 --> 03:40:38.239 align:start position:0%
receive the award one time
 
03:40:39.990 --> 03:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
you can't continually
 
03:40:42.309 --> 03:40:42.319 align:start position:0%
get the award year after year for
 
03:40:44.070 --> 03:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
showing improvement
 
03:40:46.229 --> 03:40:46.239 align:start position:0%
so like you know rye high school could
 
03:40:47.990 --> 03:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
only get it one time
 
03:40:48.000 --> 03:40:49.030 align:start position:0%
only get it one time
um

03:40:49.030 --> 03:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:51.189 --> 03:40:51.199 align:start position:0%
or potentially even
 
03:40:54.229 --> 03:40:54.239 align:start position:0%
setting up i'm channeling my inner
 
03:40:58.229 --> 03:40:58.239 align:start position:0%
uh school superintendent during um
 
03:40:58.239 --> 03:40:59.269 align:start position:0%
uh school superintendent during um
uh

03:40:59.269 --> 03:40:59.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:41:02.389 --> 03:41:02.399 align:start position:0%
union contract negotiations he got down
 
03:41:04.070 --> 03:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
to the fine details
 
03:41:06.630 --> 03:41:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:09.990 --> 03:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
put requirements or
 
03:41:13.110 --> 03:41:13.120 align:start position:0%
parameters around
 
03:41:16.469 --> 03:41:16.479 align:start position:0%
maybe schools in need versus
 
03:41:16.479 --> 03:41:18.229 align:start position:0%
maybe schools in need versus
qualifying

03:41:18.229 --> 03:41:18.239 align:start position:0%
qualifying
 
03:41:20.710 --> 03:41:20.720 align:start position:0%
schools in need and those and not not in
 
03:41:20.720 --> 03:41:21.590 align:start position:0%
schools in need and those and not not in
need

03:41:21.590 --> 03:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
need
 
03:41:24.229 --> 03:41:24.239 align:start position:0%
financially or otherwise 50 of the
 
03:41:26.790 --> 03:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
awards if we got down to that kind of
 
03:41:29.349 --> 03:41:29.359 align:start position:0%
detail within these
 
03:41:31.670 --> 03:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
awards would that be something of
 
03:41:31.680 --> 03:41:33.510 align:start position:0%
awards would that be something of
interest

03:41:33.510 --> 03:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
interest
 
03:41:33.520 --> 03:41:35.030 align:start position:0%
interest
to

03:41:35.030 --> 03:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:41:36.630 --> 03:41:36.640 align:start position:0%
all parties
 
03:41:38.790 --> 03:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
sure thank you
 
03:41:41.030 --> 03:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
go ahead uh david and i had a thought on
 
03:41:43.750 --> 03:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
that too no thanks thanks mike and and
 
03:41:45.990 --> 03:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
deb i mean i think i think
 
03:41:49.510 --> 03:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
you're on to something there however
 
03:41:49.520 --> 03:41:50.389 align:start position:0%
you're on to something there however
um

03:41:50.389 --> 03:41:50.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:53.830 --> 03:41:53.840 align:start position:0%
i guess uh you know i i i guess the the
 
03:41:57.189 --> 03:41:57.199 align:start position:0%
problems when it comes to to school
 
03:41:59.590 --> 03:41:59.600 align:start position:0%
districts having access to the funds
 
03:42:00.870 --> 03:42:00.880 align:start position:0%
they need
 
03:42:03.429 --> 03:42:03.439 align:start position:0%
um to have strong student outcomes
 
03:42:06.229 --> 03:42:06.239 align:start position:0%
universally across the uh the state and
 
03:42:09.189 --> 03:42:09.199 align:start position:0%
every district is such a great problem
 
03:42:12.550 --> 03:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
that as we spend every hour
 
03:42:13.990 --> 03:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
of our group
 
03:42:16.150 --> 03:42:16.160 align:start position:0%
on on this
 
03:42:19.349 --> 03:42:19.359 align:start position:0%
we're not putting our mind share and our
 
03:42:21.830 --> 03:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
time on solving i think a much more
 
03:42:23.910 --> 03:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
significant problem for students and
 
03:42:26.150 --> 03:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
taxpayers across the state
 
03:42:29.429 --> 03:42:29.439 align:start position:0%
and and yeah we could
 
03:42:31.990 --> 03:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
come up with a 35-page bill on how to
 
03:42:34.790 --> 03:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
spend a million dollars a year on
 
03:42:37.670 --> 03:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
on incentivizing schools
 
03:42:40.550 --> 03:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
some that have access to forty five
 
03:42:42.309 --> 03:42:42.319 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars per pupil and some that
 
03:42:44.070 --> 03:42:44.080 align:start position:0%
have access to eleven thousand dollars
 
03:42:46.630 --> 03:42:46.640 align:start position:0%
per pupil something even less than that
 
03:42:47.830 --> 03:42:47.840 align:start position:0%
less than that
 
03:42:50.550 --> 03:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
um uh in terms of um
 
03:42:52.469 --> 03:42:52.479 align:start position:0%
having good student outcomes
 
03:42:56.389 --> 03:42:56.399 align:start position:0%
and um and you know what it's probably
 
03:42:58.309 --> 03:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
it's probably a lot easier for uh for a
 
03:43:00.150 --> 03:43:00.160 align:start position:0%
school district that has access to forty
 
03:43:02.469 --> 03:43:02.479 align:start position:0%
five thousand dollars per student
 
03:43:02.479 --> 03:43:03.269 align:start position:0%
five thousand dollars per student
um

03:43:03.269 --> 03:43:03.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:43:06.469 --> 03:43:06.479 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of um maybe maybe working
 
03:43:09.670 --> 03:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
this a little bit use the example of rye
 
03:43:11.110 --> 03:43:11.120 align:start position:0%
i'm not quite sure where they're at i
 
03:43:14.229 --> 03:43:14.239 align:start position:0%
don't think they're at 40 45 but i did
 
03:43:16.950 --> 03:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
get a call from um
 
03:43:19.510 --> 03:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
from somebody in response to
 
03:43:21.670 --> 03:43:21.680 align:start position:0%
one of the rye school board
 
03:43:21.680 --> 03:43:22.870 align:start position:0%
one of the rye school board
members

03:43:22.870 --> 03:43:22.880 align:start position:0%
members
 
03:43:25.189 --> 03:43:25.199 align:start position:0%
actually she's a state rep from rye
 
03:43:26.870 --> 03:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
she gotten a phone call from one of the
 
03:43:29.510 --> 03:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
rye school board members asking why rise
 
03:43:31.189 --> 03:43:31.199 align:start position:0%
getting a million plus
 
03:43:32.469 --> 03:43:32.479 align:start position:0%
back this year because they don't get
 
03:43:35.110 --> 03:43:35.120 align:start position:0%
money back from the state for adequacy
 
03:43:37.590 --> 03:43:37.600 align:start position:0%
but they did because of the um the
 
03:43:39.750 --> 03:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
budget bill that uh that
 
03:43:42.950 --> 03:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
reduced uh swept by 100 million dollars
 
03:43:44.710 --> 03:43:44.720 align:start position:0%
and actually included a 15 million
 
03:43:47.110 --> 03:43:47.120 align:start position:0%
dollar supplemental grant to the excess
 
03:43:49.349 --> 03:43:49.359 align:start position:0%
swept towns who are losing money so rye
 
03:43:51.189 --> 03:43:51.199 align:start position:0%
was getting somewhere close to 100 to a
 
03:43:54.150 --> 03:43:54.160 align:start position:0%
million dollars uh back back for that
 
03:43:55.910 --> 03:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
and she was incredible incredulous about
 
03:43:57.990 --> 03:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
this that that there's other districts
 
03:43:59.349 --> 03:43:59.359 align:start position:0%
that need it more
 
03:44:02.790 --> 03:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
and and um and rightly so
 
03:44:02.800 --> 03:44:04.070 align:start position:0%
and and um and rightly so
um

03:44:04.070 --> 03:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:04.080 --> 03:44:04.950 align:start position:0%
um
this

03:44:04.950 --> 03:44:04.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:44:07.910 --> 03:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
bill just doesn't contemplate that at
 
03:44:07.920 --> 03:44:08.790 align:start position:0%
bill just doesn't contemplate that at
all

03:44:08.790 --> 03:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
all
 
03:44:13.189 --> 03:44:13.199 align:start position:0%
and and it it doesn't help to address
 
03:44:15.990 --> 03:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
and make things better in pittsfield or
 
03:44:18.790 --> 03:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
newport or berlin or claremont or
 
03:44:18.800 --> 03:44:20.070 align:start position:0%
newport or berlin or claremont or
manchester

03:44:20.070 --> 03:44:20.080 align:start position:0%
manchester
 
03:44:20.080 --> 03:44:21.349 align:start position:0%
manchester
um

03:44:21.349 --> 03:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:24.469 --> 03:44:24.479 align:start position:0%
and uh and frankly it does i i think you
 
03:44:24.479 --> 03:44:25.590 align:start position:0%
and uh and frankly it does i i think you
know

03:44:25.590 --> 03:44:25.600 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:44:27.030 --> 03:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
provide some
 
03:44:30.389 --> 03:44:30.399 align:start position:0%
some um you know additional opportunity
 
03:44:32.790 --> 03:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
for districts that can afford to
 
03:44:34.630 --> 03:44:34.640 align:start position:0%
i mean who who
 
03:44:37.110 --> 03:44:37.120 align:start position:0%
you know who have access to tremendous
 
03:44:39.429 --> 03:44:39.439 align:start position:0%
financial resources to apply those
 
03:44:42.309 --> 03:44:42.319 align:start position:0%
resources in different ways uh in terms
 
03:44:44.389 --> 03:44:44.399 align:start position:0%
of winning a fifty thousand dollar award
 
03:44:46.070 --> 03:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
and doing something with that for their
 
03:44:51.110 --> 03:44:51.120 align:start position:0%
student body um um uh i'm not
 
03:44:53.670 --> 03:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
not against it but i am against spending
 
03:44:55.670 --> 03:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
our mind sharing our time
 
03:44:59.429 --> 03:44:59.439 align:start position:0%
on um on working on this when when much
 
03:45:01.429 --> 03:45:01.439 align:start position:0%
much more significant problems are
 
03:45:05.830 --> 03:45:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:05.840 --> 03:45:07.590 align:start position:0%
 
uh

03:45:07.590 --> 03:45:07.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:45:11.429 --> 03:45:11.439 align:start position:0%
one of your points about uh criteria in
 
03:45:13.110 --> 03:45:13.120 align:start position:0%
how much we should get involved with
 
03:45:15.990 --> 03:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
with that my personal vision of this is
 
03:45:18.469 --> 03:45:18.479 align:start position:0%
to be is is to not be prescriptive
 
03:45:20.469 --> 03:45:20.479 align:start position:0%
basically to cut this
 
03:45:22.550 --> 03:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
right to the to the number that
 
03:45:22.560 --> 03:45:24.389 align:start position:0%
right to the to the number that
uh

03:45:24.389 --> 03:45:24.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:45:27.510 --> 03:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
i and others would like to simply make
 
03:45:29.910 --> 03:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
some extra money available
 
03:45:33.269 --> 03:45:33.279 align:start position:0%
for doe to reward success simple as that
 
03:45:34.630 --> 03:45:34.640 align:start position:0%
and then um
 
03:45:35.830 --> 03:45:35.840 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
03:45:39.110 --> 03:45:39.120 align:start position:0%
which assessment would be used yet we
 
03:45:41.030 --> 03:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
we've had some informal conversations
 
03:45:43.510 --> 03:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
kaitlyn davis had said she had a
 
03:45:45.510 --> 03:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
recommendation at some point if it ever
 
03:45:47.030 --> 03:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
gets to that point
 
03:45:49.510 --> 03:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh which assessment could she would
 
03:45:51.269 --> 03:45:51.279 align:start position:0%
recommend to be used
 
03:45:53.269 --> 03:45:53.279 align:start position:0%
once that assessment
 
03:45:55.750 --> 03:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
say this moves forward which i belong
 
03:45:57.189 --> 03:45:57.199 align:start position:0%
obviously i believe in it
 
03:45:58.870 --> 03:45:58.880 align:start position:0%
in fact i think it can do a lot of good
 
03:46:01.990 --> 03:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
in a lot of ways so it is worth our time
 
03:46:03.670 --> 03:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
and i think that uh
 
03:46:05.990 --> 03:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
many people out there i don't know me
 
03:46:07.349 --> 03:46:07.359 align:start position:0%
many folks are watching on youtube or
 
03:46:10.070 --> 03:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
will watch on youtube but uh i know that
 
03:46:11.750 --> 03:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
many people
 
03:46:14.469 --> 03:46:14.479 align:start position:0%
applaud or would applaud or will applied
 
03:46:17.269 --> 03:46:17.279 align:start position:0%
us trying to create a little extra money
 
03:46:20.710 --> 03:46:20.720 align:start position:0%
to reward success and
 
03:46:22.150 --> 03:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
which assessments can be used or the
 
03:46:24.469 --> 03:46:24.479 align:start position:0%
criteria to be used uh
 
03:46:26.070 --> 03:46:26.080 align:start position:0%
then i don't think that's for us to get
 
03:46:28.550 --> 03:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
into the weeds to do let's find
 
03:46:30.550 --> 03:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
my thinking let's find some money make
 
03:46:32.950 --> 03:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
it available to doe
 
03:46:36.550 --> 03:46:36.560 align:start position:0%
and let them develop the criteria and
 
03:46:38.469 --> 03:46:38.479 align:start position:0%
uh maybe
 
03:46:38.479 --> 03:46:39.590 align:start position:0%
uh maybe
let's

03:46:39.590 --> 03:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
let's
 
03:46:42.070 --> 03:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
try this
 
03:46:43.750 --> 03:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
hate to see the perfect be the enemy of
 
03:46:45.590 --> 03:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
the good and that's our job is what we
 
03:46:47.510 --> 03:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
do is ask questions whoever brings a
 
03:46:50.150 --> 03:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
bill in we pick it apart and ask
 
03:46:52.070 --> 03:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
troubleshoot and ask questions which is
 
03:46:52.080 --> 03:46:53.030 align:start position:0%
troubleshoot and ask questions which is
good

03:46:53.030 --> 03:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
good
 
03:46:56.150 --> 03:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
but uh i think too often really good
 
03:46:56.160 --> 03:46:57.110 align:start position:0%
but uh i think too often really good
things

03:46:57.110 --> 03:46:57.120 align:start position:0%
things
 
03:47:00.389 --> 03:47:00.399 align:start position:0%
don't move forward because we we
 
03:47:02.870 --> 03:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
get wrapped up with the
 
03:47:04.389 --> 03:47:04.399 align:start position:0%
perfect being the enemy the good anyway
 
03:47:04.399 --> 03:47:06.070 align:start position:0%
perfect being the enemy the good anyway
so

03:47:06.070 --> 03:47:06.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:47:08.870 --> 03:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
to your question or point about criteria
 
03:47:08.880 --> 03:47:09.990 align:start position:0%
to your question or point about criteria
uh

03:47:09.990 --> 03:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:47:11.030 --> 03:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
i would
 
03:47:14.150 --> 03:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:16.229 --> 03:47:16.239 align:start position:0%
let him have let him have a million
 
03:47:17.670 --> 03:47:17.680 align:start position:0%
dollars one time say it works maybe
 
03:47:19.590 --> 03:47:19.600 align:start position:0%
it'll work great and so there's another
 
03:47:21.510 --> 03:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
million dollars it goes to
 
03:47:24.229 --> 03:47:24.239 align:start position:0%
20 different schools 50 000 and in the
 
03:47:27.990 --> 03:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
process if some approaches are used or
 
03:47:29.830 --> 03:47:29.840 align:start position:0%
shared that how did they improve they
 
03:47:31.750 --> 03:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
did this i think there's great value to
 
03:47:35.030 --> 03:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
that but again that's that's my opinion
 
03:47:36.710 --> 03:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
um other
 
03:47:44.229 --> 03:47:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:46.389 --> 03:47:46.399 align:start position:0%
if not before we
 
03:47:47.990 --> 03:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
and again uh i'm not going to look to
 
03:47:49.990 --> 03:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
try to have a vote uh we don't have all
 
03:47:53.349 --> 03:47:53.359 align:start position:0%
the assigned people here uh although
 
03:47:55.590 --> 03:47:55.600 align:start position:0%
this is apparently on youtube for people
 
03:47:58.070 --> 03:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
to look at and we can come back to it
 
03:48:02.389 --> 03:48:02.399 align:start position:0%
while attorney fend is here um i i would
 
03:48:04.309 --> 03:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
like to if i could get a little bit of a
 
03:48:06.150 --> 03:48:06.160 align:start position:0%
sense from her if she
 
03:48:09.910 --> 03:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
can convey any uh
 
03:48:13.189 --> 03:48:13.199 align:start position:0%
thoughts from anyone from the d.o.e side
 
03:48:13.199 --> 03:48:14.950 align:start position:0%
thoughts from anyone from the d.o.e side
again

03:48:14.950 --> 03:48:14.960 align:start position:0%
again
 
03:48:16.710 --> 03:48:16.720 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned earlier several of us
 
03:48:17.830 --> 03:48:17.840 align:start position:0%
that have
 
03:48:19.830 --> 03:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
chatted informally with folks from d.o.e
 
03:48:21.910 --> 03:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
to include the commissioner on on on the
 
03:48:23.269 --> 03:48:23.279 align:start position:0%
concept of
 
03:48:24.950 --> 03:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
rewarding success
 
03:48:26.070 --> 03:48:26.080 align:start position:0%
and there's
 
03:48:26.950 --> 03:48:26.960 align:start position:0%
there was
 
03:48:29.269 --> 03:48:29.279 align:start position:0%
significant interest in the concept
 
03:48:29.279 --> 03:48:30.389 align:start position:0%
significant interest in the concept
um

03:48:30.389 --> 03:48:30.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:33.830 --> 03:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
so anyway uh attorney finan
 
03:48:36.790 --> 03:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
does anybody have any doe type questions
 
03:48:40.229 --> 03:48:40.239 align:start position:0%
for diana while she's here
 
03:48:42.870 --> 03:48:42.880 align:start position:0%
on how doe might
 
03:48:45.189 --> 03:48:45.199 align:start position:0%
look at this beyond what they've some of
 
03:48:46.870 --> 03:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
the folks there have said informally uh
 
03:48:49.910 --> 03:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
representative tanner never pass up it
 
03:48:53.110 --> 03:48:53.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity to ask diana question
 
03:48:54.950 --> 03:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
is there any reason that there's not any
 
03:48:57.670 --> 03:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
monetary reward to the teacher of the
 
03:49:00.229 --> 03:49:00.239 align:start position:0%
year or to the school districts that
 
03:49:02.630 --> 03:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
succeed now that are recognized for
 
03:49:04.790 --> 03:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
excellence in education at the various
 
03:49:04.800 --> 03:49:05.990 align:start position:0%
excellence in education at the various
levels

03:49:05.990 --> 03:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
levels
 
03:49:10.389 --> 03:49:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:11.990 --> 03:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh for the record diana fenton with the
 
03:49:13.750 --> 03:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
department of ed um to the best of my
 
03:49:15.349 --> 03:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
knowledge there's been no financial
 
03:49:17.269 --> 03:49:17.279 align:start position:0%
appropriation for those
 
03:49:20.070 --> 03:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
for those groups um i don't know the
 
03:49:22.150 --> 03:49:22.160 align:start position:0%
logic behind it and the reasoning behind
 
03:49:23.510 --> 03:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
it and the political decision making
 
03:49:24.710 --> 03:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
behind it which i think is really the
 
03:49:26.870 --> 03:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
crux of your question i'm not privy to
 
03:49:31.189 --> 03:49:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:32.950 --> 03:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
let me ask representative question along
 
03:49:35.269 --> 03:49:35.279 align:start position:0%
those lines if at some point and down
 
03:49:37.510 --> 03:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
the road in the future some version of
 
03:49:38.950 --> 03:49:38.960 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:49:41.030 --> 03:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh is introduced
 
03:49:43.830 --> 03:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
would you support
 
03:49:43.840 --> 03:49:45.429 align:start position:0%
would you support
a

03:49:45.429 --> 03:49:45.439 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:49:47.830 --> 03:49:47.840 align:start position:0%
measure of funding to go to d.o.e to do
 
03:49:50.469 --> 03:49:50.479 align:start position:0%
what you just described to to reward
 
03:49:52.710 --> 03:49:52.720 align:start position:0%
whoever's wins the
 
03:49:54.790 --> 03:49:54.800 align:start position:0%
teacher of the year or whatever
 
03:49:56.630 --> 03:49:56.640 align:start position:0%
i would support
 
03:49:59.269 --> 03:49:59.279 align:start position:0%
funding to go to the intrinsic rewards
 
03:50:00.790 --> 03:50:00.800 align:start position:0%
that we now
 
03:50:03.510 --> 03:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
give like teacher of the year and the
 
03:50:05.429 --> 03:50:05.439 align:start position:0%
recognition of excellence in education
 
03:50:08.070 --> 03:50:08.080 align:start position:0%
in the various levels
 
03:50:09.349 --> 03:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
through the committees that are
 
03:50:11.910 --> 03:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
currently set up to do that
 
03:50:14.309 --> 03:50:14.319 align:start position:0%
with the with the criteria that they
 
03:50:14.319 --> 03:50:15.590 align:start position:0%
with the with the criteria that they
have

03:50:15.590 --> 03:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:50:17.429 --> 03:50:17.439 align:start position:0%
on a non uh
 
03:50:20.229 --> 03:50:20.239 align:start position:0%
rather than give them money to doe to
 
03:50:22.790 --> 03:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
then give out i would give it to the
 
03:50:24.870 --> 03:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
committees that are set up
 
03:50:27.429 --> 03:50:27.439 align:start position:0%
right now to award those and i would try
 
03:50:29.670 --> 03:50:29.680 align:start position:0%
to get businesses to support it i mean
 
03:50:31.590 --> 03:50:31.600 align:start position:0%
businesses are interested in you know
 
03:50:33.030 --> 03:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
you talk about taking money from the
 
03:50:35.590 --> 03:50:35.600 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund a lot of businesses are
 
03:50:37.910 --> 03:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
are really interested in supporting
 
03:50:39.910 --> 03:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
education and as you said probably would
 
03:50:41.910 --> 03:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
be interested in rewarding
 
03:50:44.469 --> 03:50:44.479 align:start position:0%
um high performance
 
03:50:47.510 --> 03:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
and i would i would say try to get
 
03:50:49.510 --> 03:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
business sponsorship for for these
 
03:50:52.550 --> 03:50:52.560 align:start position:0%
things and and uh encourage that
 
03:50:53.830 --> 03:50:53.840 align:start position:0%
so i'm trying to understand your answer
 
03:50:56.630 --> 03:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
to my question um
 
03:50:59.269 --> 03:50:59.279 align:start position:0%
you my question was would you given what
 
03:51:01.830 --> 03:51:01.840 align:start position:0%
you said about teacher of the year would
 
03:51:03.910 --> 03:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
you support
 
03:51:07.110 --> 03:51:07.120 align:start position:0%
funding from the state
 
03:51:08.630 --> 03:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
that would be earmarked to reward
 
03:51:11.429 --> 03:51:11.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:13.269 --> 03:51:13.279 align:start position:0%
if it was done
 
03:51:16.150 --> 03:51:16.160 align:start position:0%
through the same criteria with the same
 
03:51:18.630 --> 03:51:18.640 align:start position:0%
type of committees that they now have my
 
03:51:20.469 --> 03:51:20.479 align:start position:0%
concern is the accountability of just
 
03:51:23.349 --> 03:51:23.359 align:start position:0%
giving a million dollars to doe and
 
03:51:25.349 --> 03:51:25.359 align:start position:0%
letting doe
 
03:51:27.429 --> 03:51:27.439 align:start position:0%
set up the criteria
 
03:51:29.189 --> 03:51:29.199 align:start position:0%
make the awards
 
03:51:31.349 --> 03:51:31.359 align:start position:0%
and lapse the fun you know have
 
03:51:33.670 --> 03:51:33.680 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing funds so that this amount of
 
03:51:36.870 --> 03:51:36.880 align:start position:0%
money keeps building up i that's my
 
03:51:38.790 --> 03:51:38.800 align:start position:0%
my issue so
 
03:51:42.070 --> 03:51:42.080 align:start position:0%
uh yes i i fully would support uh
 
03:51:43.670 --> 03:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
funding these different awards these
 
03:51:45.269 --> 03:51:45.279 align:start position:0%
intrinsic awards
 
03:51:46.950 --> 03:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
you're using with the state
 
03:51:50.550 --> 03:51:50.560 align:start position:0%
appropriation earmark for that but my my
 
03:51:53.429 --> 03:51:53.439 align:start position:0%
um yes state but i also think that it
 
03:51:55.990 --> 03:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
would be a great idea to try to get
 
03:51:58.469 --> 03:51:58.479 align:start position:0%
and try to get businesses
 
03:51:59.590 --> 03:51:59.600 align:start position:0%
uh just like
 
03:52:02.790 --> 03:52:02.800 align:start position:0%
grappone ford um you know supports the
 
03:52:05.750 --> 03:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
crtc in concord um i'm sure there are a
 
03:52:08.229 --> 03:52:08.239 align:start position:0%
lot of businesses that would put money
 
03:52:13.750 --> 03:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh into a fund to do that
 
03:52:15.269 --> 03:52:15.279 align:start position:0%
i think that businesses are asked to
 
03:52:17.429 --> 03:52:17.439 align:start position:0%
contribute to the teacher of the year
 
03:52:17.439 --> 03:52:18.309 align:start position:0%
contribute to the teacher of the year
um

03:52:18.309 --> 03:52:18.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:20.070 --> 03:52:20.080 align:start position:0%
what that looks like i'm not sure but i
 
03:52:21.590 --> 03:52:21.600 align:start position:0%
know that i've had those discussions i
 
03:52:23.670 --> 03:52:23.680 align:start position:0%
know i've participated in some of those
 
03:52:23.680 --> 03:52:24.710 align:start position:0%
know i've participated in some of those
um

03:52:24.710 --> 03:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:26.710 --> 03:52:26.720 align:start position:0%
some of that the communication and the
 
03:52:29.429 --> 03:52:29.439 align:start position:0%
outreach as it pertains to that um i do
 
03:52:30.870 --> 03:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
want to talk about
 
03:52:33.189 --> 03:52:33.199 align:start position:0%
kind of the criteria which has been a
 
03:52:36.630 --> 03:52:36.640 align:start position:0%
point of big big discussion here so
 
03:52:39.030 --> 03:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
as currently written this bill provides
 
03:52:42.389 --> 03:52:42.399 align:start position:0%
for rulemaking under 541a
 
03:52:43.990 --> 03:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
and so this
 
03:52:46.790 --> 03:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh this would be set up the way that a
 
03:52:48.469 --> 03:52:48.479 align:start position:0%
lot of other programs are set up at the
 
03:52:50.550 --> 03:52:50.560 align:start position:0%
doe whether it's a robotics initiative
 
03:52:53.030 --> 03:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
grant um this past legislative session
 
03:52:54.790 --> 03:52:54.800 align:start position:0%
there was a
 
03:52:57.510 --> 03:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
co-curricular activities bill
 
03:53:00.950 --> 03:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
and those are smaller amounts
 
03:53:03.030 --> 03:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollars for four thousand
 
03:53:05.830 --> 03:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
dollar grants to school districts
 
03:53:05.840 --> 03:53:06.630 align:start position:0%
dollar grants to school districts
and

03:53:06.630 --> 03:53:06.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:53:09.030 --> 03:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
in each robotics and the co-curricular
 
03:53:11.510 --> 03:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
the department has rule making authority
 
03:53:13.429 --> 03:53:13.439 align:start position:0%
to create what those programs look like
 
03:53:15.349 --> 03:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
what the criteria is
 
03:53:17.510 --> 03:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of your concern about
 
03:53:17.520 --> 03:53:19.030 align:start position:0%
in terms of your concern about
accountability

03:53:19.030 --> 03:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
03:53:21.110 --> 03:53:21.120 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of statutes that require
 
03:53:23.990 --> 03:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
the department to submit a report to the
 
03:53:24.000 --> 03:53:25.189 align:start position:0%
the department to submit a report to the
legislature

03:53:25.189 --> 03:53:25.199 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
03:53:27.590 --> 03:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
every year to document what that looks
 
03:53:28.870 --> 03:53:28.880 align:start position:0%
like i don't know if that fully
 
03:53:30.950 --> 03:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
addresses your concern but that is
 
03:53:32.710 --> 03:53:32.720 align:start position:0%
something that we've seen in other
 
03:53:35.030 --> 03:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
in other bills
 
03:53:37.110 --> 03:53:37.120 align:start position:0%
attorney you mentioned about robotics
 
03:53:39.189 --> 03:53:39.199 align:start position:0%
awards the uh
 
03:53:42.550 --> 03:53:42.560 align:start position:0%
the monies that are associated with that
 
03:53:44.630 --> 03:53:44.640 align:start position:0%
in those awards where do those monies
 
03:53:46.870 --> 03:53:46.880 align:start position:0%
come from
 
03:53:49.269 --> 03:53:49.279 align:start position:0%
i i would have to look at
 
03:53:51.269 --> 03:53:51.279 align:start position:0%
each individual
 
03:53:53.590 --> 03:53:53.600 align:start position:0%
bill but my understanding is i mean we
 
03:53:56.309 --> 03:53:56.319 align:start position:0%
can look at the co-curricular bill that
 
03:53:59.590 --> 03:53:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:01.189 --> 03:54:01.199 align:start position:0%
i don't remember the number off the top
 
03:54:07.189 --> 03:54:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:07.199 --> 03:54:08.229 align:start position:0%
 
special

03:54:08.229 --> 03:54:08.239 align:start position:0%
special
 
03:54:12.070 --> 03:54:12.080 align:start position:0%
to include special uh olympic
 
03:54:13.910 --> 03:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
athletes into different groups
 
03:54:13.920 --> 03:54:15.189 align:start position:0%
athletes into different groups
co-curricular

03:54:15.189 --> 03:54:15.199 align:start position:0%
co-curricular
 
03:54:15.199 --> 03:54:19.750 align:start position:0%
co-curricular
um

03:54:19.750 --> 03:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:40.070 --> 03:54:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:40.080 --> 03:54:41.429 align:start position:0%
 
good

03:54:41.429 --> 03:54:41.439 align:start position:0%
good
 
03:54:50.389 --> 03:54:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:51.750 --> 03:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:54:54.469 --> 03:54:54.479 align:start position:0%
um i mean it doesn't have to be based on
 
03:54:56.950 --> 03:54:56.960 align:start position:0%
that but that's certainly
 
03:54:58.469 --> 03:54:58.479 align:start position:0%
a framework
 
03:55:01.590 --> 03:55:01.600 align:start position:0%
anytime there's an appropriation to doe
 
03:55:03.910 --> 03:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
for grants to districts i always go back
 
03:55:05.670 --> 03:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
to robotics
 
03:55:07.189 --> 03:55:07.199 align:start position:0%
and then the co-curricular it gives you
 
03:55:09.189 --> 03:55:09.199 align:start position:0%
a framework on how you can structure
 
03:55:09.199 --> 03:55:10.389 align:start position:0%
a framework on how you can structure
this

03:55:10.389 --> 03:55:10.399 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:55:11.990 --> 03:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
because i know both of those bills
 
03:55:14.389 --> 03:55:14.399 align:start position:0%
robotics and co-curricular those went
 
03:55:16.309 --> 03:55:16.319 align:start position:0%
through an enormous amount of work to
 
03:55:19.030 --> 03:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
get to the final product and so i know
 
03:55:21.269 --> 03:55:21.279 align:start position:0%
representative mullen was a co-sponsor
 
03:55:23.349 --> 03:55:23.359 align:start position:0%
on the co-curricular
 
03:55:24.710 --> 03:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
bill and
 
03:55:26.790 --> 03:55:26.800 align:start position:0%
that didn't pass the first time around
 
03:55:28.309 --> 03:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that she looked at
 
03:55:30.469 --> 03:55:30.479 align:start position:0%
was robotics and we were very the
 
03:55:31.910 --> 03:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
department is very successful in
 
03:55:34.389 --> 03:55:34.399 align:start position:0%
creating the rules by which those grants
 
03:55:36.630 --> 03:55:36.640 align:start position:0%
were then distributed to districts i
 
03:55:39.990 --> 03:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
don't know if there was a um
 
03:55:41.590 --> 03:55:41.600 align:start position:0%
a report required
 
03:55:44.550 --> 03:55:44.560 align:start position:0%
of the accountability piece
 
03:55:47.189 --> 03:55:47.199 align:start position:0%
in those programs i don't recall that
 
03:55:48.710 --> 03:55:48.720 align:start position:0%
there might have been for robotics but i
 
03:55:50.710 --> 03:55:50.720 align:start position:0%
don't recall off the top of my head but
 
03:55:53.030 --> 03:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
there are other bills by which the
 
03:55:55.349 --> 03:55:55.359 align:start position:0%
department is held accountable
 
03:55:57.269 --> 03:55:57.279 align:start position:0%
and usually you see that in the form of
 
03:55:58.630 --> 03:55:58.640 align:start position:0%
reporting back
 
03:56:00.630 --> 03:56:00.640 align:start position:0%
to the legislature in some form or
 
03:56:00.640 --> 03:56:02.550 align:start position:0%
to the legislature in some form or
fashion

03:56:02.550 --> 03:56:02.560 align:start position:0%
fashion
 
03:56:04.790 --> 03:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
just a note on the co-curricular bill
 
03:56:07.510 --> 03:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
that uh that you just alluded to
 
03:56:09.670 --> 03:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
i was the original sponsor of that we
 
03:56:12.309 --> 03:56:12.319 align:start position:0%
started out two terms ago is a is a
 
03:56:14.309 --> 03:56:14.319 align:start position:0%
unified sports bill
 
03:56:16.710 --> 03:56:16.720 align:start position:0%
that has had a circuitous journey uh
 
03:56:18.950 --> 03:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
represent vlad uh laying
 
03:56:21.030 --> 03:56:21.040 align:start position:0%
the next year uh took took it over but
 
03:56:23.990 --> 03:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
fyi that bill it rips and moan and i are
 
03:56:25.830 --> 03:56:25.840 align:start position:0%
both co-sponsors going to the governor's
 
03:56:27.510 --> 03:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
desk next week
 
03:56:30.070 --> 03:56:30.080 align:start position:0%
uh so that is a uh
 
03:56:31.910 --> 03:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
is a success story and that involved a
 
03:56:33.670 --> 03:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollar
 
03:56:35.510 --> 03:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
it had a financial love it was a fifty
 
03:56:38.389 --> 03:56:38.399 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar piece of that and that
 
03:56:41.110 --> 03:56:41.120 align:start position:0%
is going to the governor next week
 
03:56:43.990 --> 03:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
so that is a success story but it took
 
03:56:46.710 --> 03:56:46.720 align:start position:0%
three terms and and financed financial
 
03:56:48.550 --> 03:56:48.560 align:start position:0%
committee and uh
 
03:56:50.229 --> 03:56:50.239 align:start position:0%
tweaking and
 
03:56:52.469 --> 03:56:52.479 align:start position:0%
anyway uh
 
03:56:54.630 --> 03:56:54.640 align:start position:0%
but i'm very interested to hear as i
 
03:56:59.110 --> 03:56:59.120 align:start position:0%
look at uh 541a and the and contemplate
 
03:56:59.120 --> 03:56:59.990 align:start position:0%
look at uh 541a and the and contemplate
the

03:56:59.990 --> 03:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:57:02.309 --> 03:57:02.319 align:start position:0%
the reality that there's a model already
 
03:57:05.429 --> 03:57:05.439 align:start position:0%
in place that does using to
 
03:57:09.349 --> 03:57:09.359 align:start position:0%
make financial awards to support um
 
03:57:11.750 --> 03:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
excellence in robotics that's that
 
03:57:13.670 --> 03:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
exists correct well i will correct your
 
03:57:15.590 --> 03:57:15.600 align:start position:0%
language just slightly it's not to
 
03:57:18.710 --> 03:57:18.720 align:start position:0%
reward excellence in robotics
 
03:57:20.469 --> 03:57:20.479 align:start position:0%
it is a grant program
 
03:57:22.229 --> 03:57:22.239 align:start position:0%
for um and again i don't have the
 
03:57:23.990 --> 03:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
language of the bill in front of me but
 
03:57:27.110 --> 03:57:27.120 align:start position:0%
it is for startup programs so that
 
03:57:29.830 --> 03:57:29.840 align:start position:0%
districts can have either a club or a
 
03:57:31.590 --> 03:57:31.600 align:start position:0%
program um
 
03:57:31.600 --> 03:57:32.389 align:start position:0%
program um
for

03:57:32.389 --> 03:57:32.399 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:57:34.870 --> 03:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
for their students and so it was to pay
 
03:57:37.349 --> 03:57:37.359 align:start position:0%
for um
 
03:57:39.110 --> 03:57:39.120 align:start position:0%
i don't know anything about robotics i'm
 
03:57:41.429 --> 03:57:41.439 align:start position:0%
embarrassed to admit but um you know
 
03:57:43.670 --> 03:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
just the startup materials
 
03:57:45.910 --> 03:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
for those types of clubs i don't think
 
03:57:48.389 --> 03:57:48.399 align:start position:0%
it was allowed to pay for the stipend
 
03:57:50.950 --> 03:57:50.960 align:start position:0%
um it would not pay for things like
 
03:57:52.790 --> 03:57:52.800 align:start position:0%
t-shirts or anything like that it was a
 
03:57:55.269 --> 03:57:55.279 align:start position:0%
focus on getting the material so that a
 
03:57:57.590 --> 03:57:57.600 align:start position:0%
district who did not have a robotics
 
03:58:00.630 --> 03:58:00.640 align:start position:0%
club previously could have that
 
03:58:02.710 --> 03:58:02.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity for for their students and
 
03:58:04.630 --> 03:58:04.640 align:start position:0%
then if there was money left over the
 
03:58:06.389 --> 03:58:06.399 align:start position:0%
leftover money could go to support an
 
03:58:08.790 --> 03:58:08.800 align:start position:0%
existing club and so what we saw around
 
03:58:12.070 --> 03:58:12.080 align:start position:0%
the state um was that people were
 
03:58:14.389 --> 03:58:14.399 align:start position:0%
taking advantage of this opportunity to
 
03:58:16.790 --> 03:58:16.800 align:start position:0%
bring in a resource that maybe their
 
03:58:19.030 --> 03:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
district didn't have previously and then
 
03:58:21.030 --> 03:58:21.040 align:start position:0%
i think that idea went into the
 
03:58:23.030 --> 03:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
co-curricular activities
 
03:58:24.870 --> 03:58:24.880 align:start position:0%
bill with the same kind of idea
 
03:58:26.950 --> 03:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
recognizing that some districts already
 
03:58:29.110 --> 03:58:29.120 align:start position:0%
have this in place and might need
 
03:58:31.750 --> 03:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
support to continue it and others would
 
03:58:34.229 --> 03:58:34.239 align:start position:0%
need that startup money so it wasn't to
 
03:58:36.550 --> 03:58:36.560 align:start position:0%
reward excellence it wasn't to recognize
 
03:58:38.150 --> 03:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
districts that already had it and was
 
03:58:40.790 --> 03:58:40.800 align:start position:0%
achieving something it was to to just
 
03:58:42.950 --> 03:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
bring opportunity to districts that did
 
03:58:44.790 --> 03:58:44.800 align:start position:0%
not have it and that would be very
 
03:58:47.429 --> 03:58:47.439 align:start position:0%
different than what is proposed um
 
03:58:50.389 --> 03:58:50.399 align:start position:0%
in front of us now but i think the
 
03:58:53.030 --> 03:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
i always call it the infrastructure
 
03:58:54.790 --> 03:58:54.800 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure by which the
 
03:58:57.189 --> 03:58:57.199 align:start position:0%
department could administer those that
 
03:59:00.070 --> 03:59:00.080 align:start position:0%
program if this bill were to pass
 
03:59:02.710 --> 03:59:02.720 align:start position:0%
is already in place we would simply
 
03:59:05.349 --> 03:59:05.359 align:start position:0%
transfer that infrastructure to this
 
03:59:05.359 --> 03:59:06.229 align:start position:0%
transfer that infrastructure to this
idea

03:59:06.229 --> 03:59:06.239 align:start position:0%
idea
 
03:59:12.950 --> 03:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:16.070 --> 03:59:16.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for making note uh
 
03:59:18.229 --> 03:59:18.239 align:start position:0%
that the you just explained that the
 
03:59:21.030 --> 03:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
infrastructure essentially is in place
 
03:59:22.469 --> 03:59:22.479 align:start position:0%
um to
 
03:59:22.479 --> 03:59:23.990 align:start position:0%
um to
implement

03:59:23.990 --> 03:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
implement
 
03:59:25.349 --> 03:59:25.359 align:start position:0%
a uh
 
03:59:27.750 --> 03:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
awarding you know providing grants to
 
03:59:30.469 --> 03:59:30.479 align:start position:0%
districts they qualify that meet the
 
03:59:30.479 --> 03:59:32.309 align:start position:0%
districts they qualify that meet the
criteria

03:59:32.309 --> 03:59:32.319 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
03:59:34.070 --> 03:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
sure that meet criteria i mean we have
 
03:59:36.630 --> 03:59:36.640 align:start position:0%
created criteria by which we say if you
 
03:59:39.189 --> 03:59:39.199 align:start position:0%
want to start a robotics program this is
 
03:59:41.030 --> 03:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
what we're looking for and we are
 
03:59:42.389 --> 03:59:42.399 align:start position:0%
prepared to do the same with a
 
03:59:42.399 --> 03:59:43.750 align:start position:0%
prepared to do the same with a
co-curricular

03:59:43.750 --> 03:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
co-curricular
 
03:59:43.760 --> 03:59:44.630 align:start position:0%
co-curricular
bill

03:59:44.630 --> 03:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:59:44.640 --> 03:59:47.750 align:start position:0%
bill
um

03:59:47.750 --> 03:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:49.590 --> 03:59:49.600 align:start position:0%
yeah so so that
 
03:59:52.070 --> 03:59:52.080 align:start position:0%
piece is in place in terms of the rule
 
03:59:53.830 --> 03:59:53.840 align:start position:0%
making and there was some discussion
 
03:59:57.510 --> 03:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:59.910 --> 03:59:59.920 align:start position:0%
in general terms when the department
 
04:00:02.229 --> 04:00:02.239 align:start position:0%
engages in rulemaking
 
04:00:04.070 --> 04:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
whatever the rule making is for whether
 
04:00:04.080 --> 04:00:04.790 align:start position:0%
whatever the rule making is for whether
it's

04:00:04.790 --> 04:00:04.800 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:00:07.429 --> 04:00:07.439 align:start position:0%
for social studies teaching certificate
 
04:00:09.590 --> 04:00:09.600 align:start position:0%
or or whatever it is
 
04:00:09.600 --> 04:00:10.950 align:start position:0%
or or whatever it is
um

04:00:10.950 --> 04:00:10.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:13.189 --> 04:00:13.199 align:start position:0%
we always work with stakeholders
 
04:00:16.950 --> 04:00:16.960 align:start position:0%
and i i have not seen a bill
 
04:00:18.790 --> 04:00:18.800 align:start position:0%
that sets out who those stakeholders
 
04:00:19.990 --> 04:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
should be
 
04:00:22.389 --> 04:00:22.399 align:start position:0%
i'm not familiar with with ever seeing a
 
04:00:23.750 --> 04:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
law that has set out who the
 
04:00:25.349 --> 04:00:25.359 align:start position:0%
stakeholders shall be
 
04:00:27.110 --> 04:00:27.120 align:start position:0%
but just in terms of our rule making
 
04:00:27.120 --> 04:00:28.229 align:start position:0%
but just in terms of our rule making
process

04:00:28.229 --> 04:00:28.239 align:start position:0%
process
 
04:00:30.710 --> 04:00:30.720 align:start position:0%
we always just
 
04:00:33.510 --> 04:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
do that as a matter of course um
 
04:00:35.510 --> 04:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
and then as part of the rule making
 
04:00:35.520 --> 04:00:36.630 align:start position:0%
and then as part of the rule making
process

04:00:36.630 --> 04:00:36.640 align:start position:0%
process
 
04:00:38.710 --> 04:00:38.720 align:start position:0%
all the rules that are proposed do go to
 
04:00:40.790 --> 04:00:40.800 align:start position:0%
a public hearing and so the public has
 
04:00:42.150 --> 04:00:42.160 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to look at what is
 
04:00:43.750 --> 04:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
proposed by the department come before
 
04:00:44.950 --> 04:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
the state board
 
04:00:44.960 --> 04:00:46.309 align:start position:0%
the state board
and

04:00:46.309 --> 04:00:46.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:00:48.550 --> 04:00:48.560 align:start position:0%
voice their concern or their opinion uh
 
04:00:51.189 --> 04:00:51.199 align:start position:0%
in support of it and so that's just a
 
04:00:52.710 --> 04:00:52.720 align:start position:0%
little insight into our rule making
 
04:00:52.720 --> 04:00:55.269 align:start position:0%
little insight into our rule making
process

04:00:55.269 --> 04:00:55.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:57.110 --> 04:00:57.120 align:start position:0%
thank you it's very interesting here
 
04:00:57.120 --> 04:00:57.990 align:start position:0%
thank you it's very interesting here
that

04:00:57.990 --> 04:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:00:59.110 --> 04:00:59.120 align:start position:0%
what you described about the
 
04:01:01.429 --> 04:01:01.439 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that currently exists to
 
04:01:04.229 --> 04:01:04.239 align:start position:0%
do what is currently being done
 
04:01:07.189 --> 04:01:07.199 align:start position:0%
potentially being a uh
 
04:01:09.269 --> 04:01:09.279 align:start position:0%
something that could be copied in some
 
04:01:11.990 --> 04:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
fashion for other initiatives it sounds
 
04:01:13.750 --> 04:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
like i mean that's certainly our plan
 
04:01:15.830 --> 04:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
for the um
 
04:01:15.840 --> 04:01:16.830 align:start position:0%
for the um
for

04:01:16.830 --> 04:01:16.840 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:01:20.070 --> 04:01:20.080 align:start position:0%
1624 um
 
04:01:22.229 --> 04:01:22.239 align:start position:0%
that's the co-curricular bill yeah bill
 
04:01:24.229 --> 04:01:24.239 align:start position:0%
um and i know that
 
04:01:26.950 --> 04:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:28.550 --> 04:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
that came from
 
04:01:31.670 --> 04:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
when representative mullen uh was
 
04:01:34.389 --> 04:01:34.399 align:start position:0%
was testifying uh to that bill i think
 
04:01:36.229 --> 04:01:36.239 align:start position:0%
last session or maybe even two sessions
 
04:01:36.239 --> 04:01:37.030 align:start position:0%
last session or maybe even two sessions
ago

04:01:37.030 --> 04:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
ago
 
04:01:38.950 --> 04:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
and i think it was itled in house
 
04:01:40.790 --> 04:01:40.800 align:start position:0%
finance division two
 
04:01:43.590 --> 04:01:43.600 align:start position:0%
and so the discussion there was this
 
04:01:45.670 --> 04:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
needs more structure
 
04:01:47.510 --> 04:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
and the thought was similar to the
 
04:01:50.469 --> 04:01:50.479 align:start position:0%
robotics grant incentive program
 
04:01:52.150 --> 04:01:52.160 align:start position:0%
which i mean i don't know how you
 
04:01:53.910 --> 04:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
measure it but it seemed to be a very
 
04:01:55.990 --> 04:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
successful initiative
 
04:01:59.990 --> 04:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
um and so that was her thought to kind
 
04:02:02.229 --> 04:02:02.239 align:start position:0%
of rework the bill and that moving
 
04:02:04.630 --> 04:02:04.640 align:start position:0%
forward is what ultimately passed and i
 
04:02:06.150 --> 04:02:06.160 align:start position:0%
know there was continuous discussion
 
04:02:08.469 --> 04:02:08.479 align:start position:0%
about that this session in house finance
 
04:02:10.469 --> 04:02:10.479 align:start position:0%
and certainly from my perspective at the
 
04:02:13.349 --> 04:02:13.359 align:start position:0%
department is we look at rulemaking and
 
04:02:15.590 --> 04:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
it's interesting because that bill
 
04:02:16.950 --> 04:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
i'll just bring this to your attention
 
04:02:18.870 --> 04:02:18.880 align:start position:0%
now because i just realized it
 
04:02:21.429 --> 04:02:21.439 align:start position:0%
in the rule making it's a may it's not a
 
04:02:23.590 --> 04:02:23.600 align:start position:0%
show i've never seen a may for rule
 
04:02:25.750 --> 04:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
making so now i'm all befuddled as to
 
04:02:26.790 --> 04:02:26.800 align:start position:0%
what i do
 
04:02:30.150 --> 04:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
but my problem not yours um
 
04:02:32.309 --> 04:02:32.319 align:start position:0%
but you know when we look at this
 
04:02:34.469 --> 04:02:34.479 align:start position:0%
that's based on robotics and so my
 
04:02:36.070 --> 04:02:36.080 align:start position:0%
thought it doesn't have to be but my
 
04:02:37.429 --> 04:02:37.439 align:start position:0%
thought is
 
04:02:39.110 --> 04:02:39.120 align:start position:0%
any time that the department is going to
 
04:02:42.469 --> 04:02:42.479 align:start position:0%
be tasked with issuing grants that are
 
04:02:46.309 --> 04:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
based on criteria of some sort
 
04:02:48.229 --> 04:02:48.239 align:start position:0%
we will go back to look at what worked
 
04:02:50.150 --> 04:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
in the past what can be
 
04:02:51.990 --> 04:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
made better but yes we have that
 
04:02:55.510 --> 04:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
infrastructure in place to do that
 
04:02:57.349 --> 04:02:57.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for that
 
04:03:00.150 --> 04:03:00.160 align:start position:0%
are the questions for
 
04:03:04.550 --> 04:03:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:08.309 --> 04:03:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:09.670 --> 04:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
i have no further questions for the
 
04:03:13.030 --> 04:03:13.040 align:start position:0%
witness i i feel i i purposely did not
 
04:03:14.870 --> 04:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
sit in the chairman's chair because i'm
 
04:03:14.880 --> 04:03:15.830 align:start position:0%
sit in the chairman's chair because i'm
not

04:03:15.830 --> 04:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:03:18.070 --> 04:03:18.080 align:start position:0%
not worthy of the old days
 
04:03:20.469 --> 04:03:20.479 align:start position:0%
so we have an hour plus that we have on
 
04:03:23.189 --> 04:03:23.199 align:start position:0%
youtube presumably that people can
 
04:03:25.990 --> 04:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
uh alicia's not here as with this
 
04:03:29.510 --> 04:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
morning that is there for uh
 
04:03:31.510 --> 04:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
people to look at
 
04:03:31.520 --> 04:03:32.630 align:start position:0%
people to look at
uh

04:03:32.630 --> 04:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:03:35.269 --> 04:03:35.279 align:start position:0%
i'm not gonna try to have a vote on any
 
04:03:36.870 --> 04:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
met any emotions
 
04:03:40.309 --> 04:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
unless the whole group is here
 
04:03:43.429 --> 04:03:43.439 align:start position:0%
um so i as i said with most of you here
 
04:03:45.510 --> 04:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
for the other the other session i'll
 
04:03:47.590 --> 04:03:47.600 align:start position:0%
organize some notes
 
04:03:48.870 --> 04:03:48.880 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:03:50.630 --> 04:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
share the notes with everyone and then
 
04:03:54.150 --> 04:03:54.160 align:start position:0%
once we all agree that whatever notes
 
04:03:56.790 --> 04:03:56.800 align:start position:0%
uh reflect our back and forth i'll send
 
04:03:58.790 --> 04:03:58.800 align:start position:0%
that to the chair
 
04:04:00.469 --> 04:04:00.479 align:start position:0%
and then um
 
04:04:02.790 --> 04:04:02.800 align:start position:0%
we can come back to things in september
 
04:04:04.229 --> 04:04:04.239 align:start position:0%
once people
 
04:04:07.030 --> 04:04:07.040 align:start position:0%
can look at the youtubes or here
 
04:04:10.229 --> 04:04:10.239 align:start position:0%
and other folks can weigh in as well
 
04:04:10.239 --> 04:04:11.429 align:start position:0%
and other folks can weigh in as well
uh

04:04:11.429 --> 04:04:11.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:04:14.150 --> 04:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
anything else uh that's where i'm at
 
04:04:14.160 --> 04:04:15.269 align:start position:0%
anything else uh that's where i'm at
i'll

04:04:15.269 --> 04:04:15.279 align:start position:0%
i'll
 
04:04:19.110 --> 04:04:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:23.110 --> 04:04:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:23.120 --> 04:04:24.229 align:start position:0%
 
well

04:04:24.229 --> 04:04:24.239 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:04:26.550 --> 04:04:26.560 align:start position:0%
uh there's a motion on the floor i guess
 
04:04:28.870 --> 04:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
in this working session uh yeah if
 
04:04:28.880 --> 04:04:29.670 align:start position:0%
in this working session uh yeah if
there's

04:04:29.670 --> 04:04:29.680 align:start position:0%
there's
 
04:04:32.469 --> 04:04:32.479 align:start position:0%
nothing else be added um i'll work on
 
04:04:35.349 --> 04:04:35.359 align:start position:0%
some notes and we'll press on in the
 
04:04:37.750 --> 04:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
and whoever's watching on youtube thanks
 
04:04:43.189 --> 04:04:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:44.950 --> 04:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
