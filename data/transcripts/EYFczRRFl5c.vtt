00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 align:start position:0%
house version looked at an opportunity
 
00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 align:start position:0%
to have a couple of expert um lawyers
 
00:03:58.429 --> 00:03:58.439 align:start position:0%
available and thought it was time to
 
00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 align:start position:0%
overhaul the
 
00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
laws on Ed on education which had some
 
00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 align:start position:0%
contradictions and some some other
 
00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:09.439 align:start position:0%
problems with them that had been brought
 
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 align:start position:0%
up the bill only came to finance because
 
00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:15.479 align:start position:0%
it was just a matter of uh raising
 
00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
$100,000 to hire the expert to do this
 
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 align:start position:0%
and so it passed the house and passed it
 
00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 align:start position:0%
passed the finance committee pass the
 
00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 align:start position:0%
house went to the
 
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 align:start position:0%
Senate the Senate put all sorts of stuff
 
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 align:start position:0%
on it that should have gone to an
 
00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 align:start position:0%
education committee it made it permanent
 
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 align:start position:0%
in in law and it had things which I
 
00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 align:start position:0%
think are never called for in law where
 
00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
it says uh I you know any other person
 
00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 align:start position:0%
they think should be added on a
 
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 align:start position:0%
commission that's not good law that's
 
00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
not good language they're not on the
 
00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 align:start position:0%
commission they are on advisory P
 
00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 align:start position:0%
different than the commission either way
 
00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 align:start position:0%
it's in law with anybody can be added I
 
00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
don't like that language I don't like
 
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
the Senate version at
 
00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 align:start position:0%
it thank you Mr chairman but just point
 
00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 align:start position:0%
out that it's not permanent there's a
 
00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
prospective repeal in 2026 so the
 
00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
Senate gave the commission two years to
 
00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
do the recodification and then repeal
 
00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:38.759 align:start position:0%
and in addition to all that um the rsas
 
00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 align:start position:0%
right now clearly state that uh
 
00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
recodification is the purview of the OS
 
00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
people and not you you don't want the
 
00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
fox Garden the hen house and that's what
 
00:05:57.309 --> 00:05:57.319 align:start position:0%
your bill did is it gave money to uh
 
00:05:59.749 --> 00:05:59.759 align:start position:0%
education but didn't give anything to ol
 
00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:02.840 align:start position:0%
s and Os according with the existing
 
00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:04.639 align:start position:0%
state law is supposed to be in charge of
 
00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:05.990 align:start position:0%
state law is supposed to be in charge of
recodification

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
recodification
 
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
I didn't fight given the money to
 
00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:12.919 align:start position:0%
education but I certainly added the the
 
00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:17.639 align:start position:0%
money to uh OS so that they can hire
 
00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:19.360 align:start position:0%
hopefully one of their
 
00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:22.759 align:start position:0%
recent uh Alum we'll put it that way
 
00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:24.280 align:start position:0%
those were the people we were targeting
 
00:06:27.589 --> 00:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
to to help uh but they should not be
 
00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:29.800 align:start position:0%
reporting to the Department of Ed they
 
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
should be reporting to Mr Alec
 
00:06:36.909 --> 00:06:36.919 align:start position:0%
onas Mr chairman representative em uh we
 
00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
had the public hearing on this uh as it
 
00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
were and it started it was an idea that
 
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
said why don't we just
 
00:06:48.589 --> 00:06:48.599 align:start position:0%
identify the areas where there's direct
 
00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
conflict it wasn't re Rec codify the
 
00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:54.800 align:start position:0%
whole title 15 it was
 
00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
just in our committee we kept hearing
 
00:06:59.110 --> 00:06:59.120 align:start position:0%
little well this and this says this and
 
00:07:00.869 --> 00:07:00.879 align:start position:0%
this one says says that that's all we
 
00:07:02.869 --> 00:07:02.879 align:start position:0%
were interested in and that's Hill's
 
00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
original bill was just to do minor
 
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
identification and then have OSS right
 
00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:13.160 align:start position:0%
fixes as you were but this guy it got
 
00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:14.720 align:start position:0%
bigger I mean it turned into a whole
 
00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:17.080 align:start position:0%
reification the whole thing so I think
 
00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:17.950 align:start position:0%
reification the whole thing so I think
the

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:17.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:07:21.029 --> 00:07:21.039 align:start position:0%
intent at least in that in the uh
 
00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
sponsor's mind and in in division two
 
00:07:27.869 --> 00:07:27.879 align:start position:0%
was small fixes not entire
 
00:07:31.189 --> 00:07:31.199 align:start position:0%
rewrites uh just I identify that the
 
00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
glitches that are currently exist so I
 
00:07:35.309 --> 00:07:35.319 align:start position:0%
think part of us perspective on what
 
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do
 
00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
here well when you actually look at
 
00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
who's on the commission you've got one
 
00:07:46.589 --> 00:07:46.599 align:start position:0%
Senator you got two house members you've
 
00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:48.800 align:start position:0%
got the uh
 
00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner and then you've got
 
00:07:55.149 --> 00:07:55.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:00.629 --> 00:08:00.639 align:start position:0%
Justice uh I'm reading line S through
 
00:08:04.189 --> 00:08:04.199 align:start position:0%
11 all right 1 through
 
00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
4 and when we get down to B that starts
 
00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
the advisory panel and just like
 
00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
anything else they don't have a vote
 
00:08:16.629 --> 00:08:16.639 align:start position:0%
they don't but they should
 
00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:21.080 align:start position:0%
be you know named for consistency sake
 
00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:24.360 align:start position:0%
and that's what we did and in six the
 
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:27.680 align:start position:0%
one you object to the most chairman is
 
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
that you know it is the advisory
 
00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
committee uh who is going to say they
 
00:08:35.589 --> 00:08:35.599 align:start position:0%
are or they aren't part of the advisory
 
00:08:36.829 --> 00:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
I should say it's going to be the
 
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:39.240 align:start position:0%
commission that says they they do or
 
00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:41.080 align:start position:0%
don't need
 
00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:43.800 align:start position:0%
them I mean well actually it's going to
 
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
be the
 
00:08:48.269 --> 00:08:48.279 align:start position:0%
legislature in this the way it's written
 
00:08:50.389 --> 00:08:50.399 align:start position:0%
well no any any changes would have to be
 
00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:53.640 align:start position:0%
legislation the legislation here gives
 
00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:56.720 align:start position:0%
them the permission uh this is line 22
 
00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:00.040 align:start position:0%
in the Senate version uh
 
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
six it says additional individuals or
 
00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
organizations uh the commission deems
 
00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:09.800 align:start position:0%
relevant uh to its study I've never seen
 
00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:11.560 align:start position:0%
that before in a
 
00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.310 align:start position:0%
that before in a
commission

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:13.320 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
but they're not adding them to the
 
00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:17.480 align:start position:0%
commission they're adding them to this
 
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:20.320 align:start position:0%
advisory panel which are not members of
 
00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
the commission represent Heath so we
 
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
know there are a lot of conflicts um
 
00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:28.360 align:start position:0%
just charter schools in one section can
 
00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:30.200 align:start position:0%
get building Aid in another section they
 
00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:31.800 align:start position:0%
can't get building it in and I'm sure
 
00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:34.200 align:start position:0%
there are lots of other places we need
 
00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:37.760 align:start position:0%
somebody to identify the
 
00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:40.120 align:start position:0%
conflix I don't think it's a bad idea to
 
00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:42.320 align:start position:0%
have somebody look at what the work that
 
00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:44.760 align:start position:0%
they've done my preference would be that
 
00:09:47.069 --> 00:09:47.079 align:start position:0%
we come up with a document that
 
00:09:50.069 --> 00:09:50.079 align:start position:0%
ultimately becomes a bill that has to go
 
00:09:52.069 --> 00:09:52.079 align:start position:0%
through the legislature saying these are
 
00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:54.200 align:start position:0%
the changes we're going to make so that
 
00:09:58.710 --> 00:09:58.720 align:start position:0%
in fact there's we take the political
 
00:09:59.910 --> 00:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
out of it
 
00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:04.120 align:start position:0%
um and just have a working document that
 
00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
goes into our laws that works for
 
00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
everybody because right now there it's
 
00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:10.640 align:start position:0%
confusing being a former Deputy
 
00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:13.160 align:start position:0%
Commissioner working with the the law
 
00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
book is not an easy thing to do and I
 
00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
think Caitlyn can attest to why the
 
00:10:20.389 --> 00:10:20.399 align:start position:0%
department came forward and asked for us
 
00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
to do this um I don't have a problem
 
00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:26.720 align:start position:0%
with a group of people working in advis
 
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:28.720 align:start position:0%
like a commission to look at what the
 
00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:31.000 align:start position:0%
work that the attorney's doing I'd love
 
00:10:32.949 --> 00:10:32.959 align:start position:0%
to see Anthony or somebody like Anthony
 
00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:36.680 align:start position:0%
do this work um but I can't see the
 
00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
commission would take forever for the
 
00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
commission it would be monotonous it
 
00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
would be like going line by line by line
 
00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:46.040 align:start position:0%
it would be horrible I I can't even
 
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
imagine how monotonous that work would
 
00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:50.120 align:start position:0%
be but if we had somebody first do the
 
00:10:52.269 --> 00:10:52.279 align:start position:0%
work and then have somebody a group of
 
00:10:53.509 --> 00:10:53.519 align:start position:0%
people come
 
00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
together certainly the vision that I had
 
00:11:01.389 --> 00:11:01.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:04.509 --> 00:11:04.519 align:start position:0%
uh between education and the people in
 
00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
OSS they would come up with the
 
00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:09.720 align:start position:0%
recommendations and when there was a
 
00:11:12.949 --> 00:11:12.959 align:start position:0%
conflict like you say in many places you
 
00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:14.920 align:start position:0%
know building Aid is one they can and
 
00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
they can't uh that they then would go to
 
00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:20.240 align:start position:0%
the commission and the commission would
 
00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
say the way we want the new bill that is
 
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
going to come from this drafted is and
 
00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
that would come from those Commission
 
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
members the senator the two house
 
00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:35.160 align:start position:0%
members the commissioner of Ed and
 
00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:38.120 align:start position:0%
ol that's what the vision you've taken a
 
00:11:41.069 --> 00:11:41.079 align:start position:0%
clean process and made it political I
 
00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
me Senator thank you Mr chairman I don't
 
00:11:54.389 --> 00:11:54.399 align:start position:0%
I don't read the
 
00:11:59.750 --> 00:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
commission as actually having to to
 
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:03.680 align:start position:0%
do the drafting it's more they would
 
00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
introduce they would agree to changes my
 
00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:09.200 align:start position:0%
notes from the public Hearing in the
 
00:12:13.189 --> 00:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
Senate is that this would end up this
 
00:12:18.189 --> 00:12:18.199 align:start position:0%
could be A500 page Bill to rec
 
00:12:22.509 --> 00:12:22.519 align:start position:0%
codify all those sections of Statute it
 
00:12:29.509 --> 00:12:29.519 align:start position:0%
is O s's responsibility under RSA 17A
 
00:12:32.269 --> 00:12:32.279 align:start position:0%
um it's not an executive
 
00:12:32.279 --> 00:12:33.829 align:start position:0%
um it's not an executive
branch

00:12:33.829 --> 00:12:33.839 align:start position:0%
branch
 
00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:38.920 align:start position:0%
function but neither all has nor
 
00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:40.509 align:start position:0%
function but neither all has nor
education

00:12:40.509 --> 00:12:40.519 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:44.240 align:start position:0%
has the resources right now which is why
 
00:12:46.389 --> 00:12:46.399 align:start position:0%
we put the
 
00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
$100,000 for each of them for attorneys
 
00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:53.560 align:start position:0%
and gave them an extra year
 
00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
but I don't I don't read it as these
 
00:13:01.949 --> 00:13:01.959 align:start position:0%
three legis lers plus the commissioner
 
00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:05.000 align:start position:0%
of education and the director of os
 
00:13:09.269 --> 00:13:09.279 align:start position:0%
that's sitting around and saying okay
 
00:13:14.509 --> 00:13:14.519 align:start position:0%
let's let's change this this word here I
 
00:13:17.269 --> 00:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
I read it as this would be the
 
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
recommendation of the
 
00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:23.720 align:start position:0%
lawyers with input from The Advisory
 
00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
Board and it would be a commission
 
00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
recommending recodification a on the
 
00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
statutes which hasn't been done for like
 
00:13:38.189 --> 00:13:38.199 align:start position:0%
50 years like ever okay
 
00:13:42.829 --> 00:13:42.839 align:start position:0%
long longer than Lou alesandro has been
 
00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:47.160 align:start position:0%
in the legislature so I think Mr Senator
 
00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
gray I think that's why the
 
00:13:55.509 --> 00:13:55.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:58.790 --> 00:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
did representative muray thank you U my
 
00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
understanding was that um this is a very
 
00:14:05.949 --> 00:14:05.959 align:start position:0%
tedious job which one competent person
 
00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:08.360 align:start position:0%
could do um I don't think that there's a
 
00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:10.600 align:start position:0%
lot of back and forth about is there is
 
00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
this a conflict or not either it is or
 
00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:13.720 align:start position:0%
it isn't and I think we have a lawyer
 
00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
who can put forth to say that and I
 
00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
didn't Envision a lot of back and forth
 
00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
with the commissioner and Advisory board
 
00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:22.120 align:start position:0%
but that this person would do the job
 
00:14:24.509 --> 00:14:24.519 align:start position:0%
and submit a report um perhaps you know
 
00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:26.959 align:start position:0%
to that commission at when it's done but
 
00:14:28.389 --> 00:14:28.399 align:start position:0%
it seemed like it would just be back and
 
00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
forth it be the never ending badminton
 
00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
gain if we had to keep going back and
 
00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:35.320 align:start position:0%
forth so I would see this person hired
 
00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
hopefully I guess you know some people
 
00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure um doe has people who can
 
00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
go through this find the issues and then
 
00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:43.880 align:start position:0%
come back and present it to us that's
 
00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
kind of how I saw it and then from there
 
00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
we would construct bills or do what have
 
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
to be done but I agree it would be a
 
00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.829 align:start position:0%
to be done but I agree it would be a
lengthy

00:14:52.829 --> 00:14:52.839 align:start position:0%
lengthy
 
00:14:55.069 --> 00:14:55.079 align:start position:0%
submission and it would probably be
 
00:14:57.069 --> 00:14:57.079 align:start position:0%
start in the department of of the
 
00:14:59.509 --> 00:14:59.519 align:start position:0%
committee on education yes and they
 
00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
would probably be looking at these
 
00:15:02.269 --> 00:15:02.279 align:start position:0%
things and some of them they probably
 
00:15:03.829 --> 00:15:03.839 align:start position:0%
brought up through the years obviously
 
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
this the uh commission the chairman of
 
00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:09.160 align:start position:0%
education is saying they've got to split
 
00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:10.680 align:start position:0%
the bill up split the committee up it's
 
00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:13.160 align:start position:0%
just too many bills I think aund and
 
00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:15.320 align:start position:0%
something oh they're awful this year oh
 
00:15:19.069 --> 00:15:19.079 align:start position:0%
114 the difference yes yeah the
 
00:15:21.509 --> 00:15:21.519 align:start position:0%
difference between my vision and your
 
00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
vision is that what would go to the
 
00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:29.000 align:start position:0%
education committee would be a bill that
 
00:15:32.069 --> 00:15:32.079 align:start position:0%
was ready to be introduced and to get to
 
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
there then the commission would be the
 
00:15:38.509 --> 00:15:38.519 align:start position:0%
ones that would make the decision of
 
00:15:40.749 --> 00:15:40.759 align:start position:0%
again we'll go back to the funding they
 
00:15:43.389 --> 00:15:43.399 align:start position:0%
would say okay we want to go in this
 
00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
direction and
 
00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
those five individuals uh yeah would be
 
00:15:51.309 --> 00:15:51.319 align:start position:0%
the ones that would give us you know the
 
00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:54.680 align:start position:0%
rudder orders for that and say yes we
 
00:15:57.269 --> 00:15:57.279 align:start position:0%
want to be able to fund uh Charter
 
00:15:59.749 --> 00:15:59.759 align:start position:0%
Schools building
 
00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:01.720 align:start position:0%
okay and then that would that would
 
00:16:04.509 --> 00:16:04.519 align:start position:0%
influence where the lawyers went echoing
 
00:16:06.269 --> 00:16:06.279 align:start position:0%
representative Murray too much back and
 
00:16:08.389 --> 00:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
forth almost every every decision you
 
00:16:10.189 --> 00:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
make has got to be discussed rather than
 
00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
saying okay here's the first 200 Pages
 
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
here's what we've come up with as the
 
00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
worst Parts what do you think and then
 
00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:18.160 align:start position:0%
go on to the next few hundred pages and
 
00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:20.120 align:start position:0%
like that rather than go back and forth
 
00:16:23.269 --> 00:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
every little change so um would it be
 
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
amenable to have this one person produce
 
00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:27.560 align:start position:0%
the document and have your commission
 
00:16:29.509 --> 00:16:29.519 align:start position:0%
look at it at the end
 
00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
um when you made the comment about
 
00:16:33.309 --> 00:16:33.319 align:start position:0%
building aid for Charter Schools yes or
 
00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:35.560 align:start position:0%
no it's already we already have laws
 
00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
about it the question is which one and
 
00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:39.759 align:start position:0%
this lawyer would come back to say this
 
00:16:42.829 --> 00:16:42.839 align:start position:0%
is the current status of this particular
 
00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
part of education and in that document
 
00:16:46.949 --> 00:16:46.959 align:start position:0%
that this lawyer or whoever would put
 
00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:49.000 align:start position:0%
together um that's where we would look
 
00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:50.720 align:start position:0%
to see oh I didn't know that this was
 
00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:52.480 align:start position:0%
the current law or you know perhaps we
 
00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:55.240 align:start position:0%
all should have but you've seen the book
 
00:16:58.189 --> 00:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
um and to make their recommendations
 
00:16:59.829 --> 00:16:59.839 align:start position:0%
from that based on that because it
 
00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be it shouldn't be debatable
 
00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
either it's the RSA or it's not and it's
 
00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
looking to see what is most what it is
 
00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:09.640 align:start position:0%
most um most current and what do we need
 
00:17:11.189 --> 00:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
to do with it and seems you know the
 
00:17:12.429 --> 00:17:12.439 align:start position:0%
commission can look at that at the end
 
00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
and then send it off to education also
 
00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:16.120 align:start position:0%
you've got a lot of experts on education
 
00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
in the Senate and in the house and a lot
 
00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:19.360 align:start position:0%
of the people I think that you're
 
00:17:23.429 --> 00:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
referring to uh would show up to
 
00:17:25.909 --> 00:17:25.919 align:start position:0%
testify but somebody has to do the work
 
00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
first you know that's right you know
 
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.990 align:start position:0%
first you know that's right you know
we're

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:31.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:33.480 align:start position:0%
we're making a a a mountain out of this
 
00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:36.440 align:start position:0%
moh okay you have
 
00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
that representative that is
 
00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
not and when you're ready when you're
 
00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:44.720 align:start position:0%
ready to come back right now the Senate
 
00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
is going to recess and when you're ready
 
00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:50.440 align:start position:0%
to speak civil we'll be back tell me
 
00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:52.440 align:start position:0%
when you are I am not going to agree to
 
00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:54.760 align:start position:0%
any part of the Senate
 
00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:57.240 align:start position:0%
bill then what I just heard the chair
 
00:17:59.870 --> 00:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
say is that you are not willing to
 
00:18:01.909 --> 00:18:01.919 align:start position:0%
change and the Senate position right now
 
00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:04.200 align:start position:0%
is that what you've put in front of us
 
00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:07.640 align:start position:0%
is unworkable and we cannot agreed
 
00:18:16.789 --> 00:18:16.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:19.320 align:start position:0%
dies thank you Caitlyn did you feel
 
00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:57.710 align:start position:0%
 
pass

00:18:57.710 --> 00:18:57.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:27.710 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:27.720 align:start position:0%
