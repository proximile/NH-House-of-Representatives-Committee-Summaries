finance committee so we've we've been
 
00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 align:start position:0%
talking about uh these nine bills for a
 
00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:52.199 align:start position:0%
while uh and and today is uh just we're
 
00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
going to we're going to be finished with
 
00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 align:start position:0%
our decision not because the decision is
 
00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 align:start position:0%
ready to be finalized but because we've
 
00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 align:start position:0%
it's time to finish so um we're going to
 
00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 align:start position:0%
be out of here at
 
00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 align:start position:0%
2:45 uh we've got some some hot fresh
 
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
amendments coming on
 
00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
1573 so we're probably going to do it
 
00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 align:start position:0%
last um uh and uh so uh um Mr Ripple if
 
00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 align:start position:0%
OS wraps up the amendments to 1573 while
 
00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:26.479 align:start position:0%
we're talking are you are you going to
 
00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:30.039 align:start position:0%
be informed I believe so yes I'll and
 
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
I'll print them out obviously and hand
 
00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 align:start position:0%
them out I'm not sure if that's going to
 
00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
happen for both amendments in the next
 
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 align:start position:0%
two hours and 45 minutes um I might have
 
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
to hand out drafts if it comes to
 
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 align:start position:0%
that all right okay it obviously it's
 
00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:45.039 align:start position:0%
better if we have the real thing but
 
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 align:start position:0%
those we were working on those kind of
 
00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:51.639 align:start position:0%
late um all right so with that in mind
 
00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
uh on Monday we had three bills that we
 
00:05:59.189 --> 00:05:59.199 align:start position:0%
thought we were comfortable with um uh
 
00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:01.039 align:start position:0%
locking down with
 
00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
recommendations those three were House
 
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.909 align:start position:0%
recommendations those three were House
Bill

1564 we recommended an OTP on that house
 
00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.550 align:start position:0%
1564 we recommended an OTP on that house
bill

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
1282 we locked down an otpa with that
 
00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:17.919 align:start position:0%
and on House Bill
 
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
1593 we locked down an Opa on that is
 
00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:26.599 align:start position:0%
there anyone in division 3 that would
 
00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:29.160 align:start position:0%
like us to reconsider the decisions we
 
00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:31.280 align:start position:0%

that we we concluded on Monday which
 
00:07:37.309 --> 00:07:37.319 align:start position:0%

1595 representative priest uh I would

you go ahead and speak to that what what
 
00:08:01.309 --> 00:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
what do you think the issue is in your
 
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:12.149 --> 00:08:12.159 align:start position:0%
uh of abuse domestic abuse um that's not
 
00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
adequately covered in
 
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
1595 could could you elaborate on that
 
00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:22.520 align:start position:0%
is the way we amended it it's it's a for
 
00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
there's a formula there that's supposed
 
00:08:28.029 --> 00:08:28.039 align:start position:0%
to simplify and help the the the courts
 
00:08:31.149 --> 00:08:31.159 align:start position:0%
determine um a appropriate shares I I
 
00:08:34.269 --> 00:08:34.279 align:start position:0%
don't see there's any mention of
 
00:08:39.029 --> 00:08:39.039 align:start position:0%
domestic abuse in the amendment for
 
00:08:41.829 --> 00:08:41.839 align:start position:0%
1595 and and how would you have it
 
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
included what and what I if if you'd
 
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
like to turn it over to representative
 
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:49.800 align:start position:0%
tersi that that's okay that would be
 
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:59.110 --> 00:08:59.120 align:start position:0%

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:02.200 align:start position:0%
say thank you to the division for giving
 
00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
me the
 
00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:07.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity to um look at this one again
 
00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
I apologize I have actually written
 
00:09:13.389 --> 00:09:13.399 align:start position:0%
remarks um because I found as I was
 
00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:14.680 align:start position:0%
discussing it with different people I
 
00:09:16.269 --> 00:09:16.279 align:start position:0%
was getting a little emotional about
 
00:09:19.269 --> 00:09:19.279 align:start position:0%
this topic so I appreciate your
 
00:09:21.269 --> 00:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
willingness to hear me out as I just
 
00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:24.440 align:start position:0%
would like to say a few things about
 
00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
1595 um as chairman Edward stated in an
 
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
email to us earlier this week he I had
 
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
spoken prior to our last meeting about
 
00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
concerns that we both had with House
 
00:09:37.389 --> 00:09:37.399 align:start position:0%
Bill 1595 and I had agreed with chairman
 
00:09:39.069 --> 00:09:39.079 align:start position:0%
Edwards that there was an interest in
 
00:09:40.389 --> 00:09:40.399 align:start position:0%
pursuing interim
 
00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:42.680 align:start position:0%
study from my review of the proposed
 
00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
amendment for 1595 I was not convinced
 
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:47.320 align:start position:0%
that it was the right path to move
 
00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
forward with that
 
00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
one while House Bill 1564 is already out
 
00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:54.160 align:start position:0%
of this Division I think all of us can
 
00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
agree that the two bills have been tied
 
00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
together in a way that it's impossible
 
00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
to speak about one without the other
 
00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
what concerns me is that I have had the
 
00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:06.240 align:start position:0%
feeling that because they had similar
 
00:10:08.269 --> 00:10:08.279 align:start position:0%
fiscal notes and that both dealt with
 
00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
child support that they were being
 
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:12.240 align:start position:0%
treated as very similar bills with only
 
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
minor differences that could be easily
 
00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:16.120 align:start position:0%
addressed and
 
00:10:18.389 --> 00:10:18.399 align:start position:0%
combined we heard from the beginning
 
00:10:20.949 --> 00:10:20.959 align:start position:0%
that house bill 1564 was a no-brainer it
 
00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:22.440 align:start position:0%
came out of the policy committee with
 
00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
unanimous recommendation and to pass the
 
00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:26.600 align:start position:0%
house unanimously and the level of
 
00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:29.000 align:start position:0%
agreement on this bill was clear and
 
00:10:31.389 --> 00:10:31.399 align:start position:0%
passing it was the right thing to do on
 
00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:33.720 align:start position:0%
the other hand House Bill 1595 did not
 
00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:35.560 align:start position:0%
come to this division with such a clear
 
00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:38.720 align:start position:0%
path the policy committee had been split
 
00:10:40.629 --> 00:10:40.639 align:start position:0%
and the house had a divided vote on the
 
00:10:44.509 --> 00:10:44.519 align:start position:0%
bill we received many emails um
 
00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
discussing the use of parenting time as
 
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
a factor in the calculation of child
 
00:10:50.069 --> 00:10:50.079 align:start position:0%
support and it's my belief that the
 
00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:53.320 align:start position:0%
parenting formula makes things more
 
00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
complicated Waypoint a highly respected
 
00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
advocate for Children and Families
 
00:10:59.790 --> 00:10:59.800 align:start position:0%
stated this change would likely result
 
00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:01.720 align:start position:0%
in lower support amounts for lower
 
00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:04.120 align:start position:0%
earning parents likewise New Hampshire
 
00:11:06.069 --> 00:11:06.079 align:start position:0%
legal assistants concurred with this
 
00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:08.600 align:start position:0%
fear that lower income earning parents
 
00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:10.200 align:start position:0%
would be the ones
 
00:11:12.389 --> 00:11:12.399 align:start position:0%
affected most often parents who are
 
00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
victims of domestic violence are the
 
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:16.720 align:start position:0%
lower earning parents who struggle with
 
00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
poverty the amendment to House Bill 1595
 
00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
that was passed still relies on
 
00:11:24.509 --> 00:11:24.519 align:start position:0%
parenting time and that in and of itself
 
00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
is inherently problematic in cases of
 
00:11:30.629 --> 00:11:30.639 align:start position:0%
domestic violence or situations of abuse
 
00:11:32.269 --> 00:11:32.279 align:start position:0%
anytime that parenting time is fully
 
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
connected to a dollar amount it turns
 
00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:37.000 align:start position:0%
kids into ponds it turns parenting time
 
00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:40.120 align:start position:0%
into a currency by declaring what that
 
00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
time is actually worth in domestic
 
00:11:44.949 --> 00:11:44.959 align:start position:0%
violence cases it enhances the
 
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:47.680 align:start position:0%
controlling nature of the abuser with
 
00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:50.360 align:start position:0%
ways to take money and the
 
00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:52.720 align:start position:0%
kids even in cases where domestic
 
00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:55.480 align:start position:0%
violence is not an issue but there is
 
00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
high conflict where parents don't agree
 
00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:00.440 align:start position:0%
on anything it becomes a competition
 
00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:02.920 align:start position:0%
with the children in the middle both of
 
00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:03.829 align:start position:0%
with the children in the middle both of
these

00:12:03.829 --> 00:12:03.839 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:12:06.269 --> 00:12:06.279 align:start position:0%
instances would include parents taking
 
00:12:08.629 --> 00:12:08.639 align:start position:0%
parenting time that they previously may
 
00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:11.160 align:start position:0%
have had no interest in didn't have time
 
00:12:12.629 --> 00:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
for or
 
00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
misused this doesn't protect or look out
 
00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:16.720 align:start position:0%
for the welfare of
 
00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
children we do not want to set a
 
00:12:20.509 --> 00:12:20.519 align:start position:0%
precedent where our state values
 
00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
monetary importance over the importance
 
00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:24.040 align:start position:0%
of the healthiest possible upbringing
 
00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:26.600 align:start position:0%
for our children it will lead to the
 
00:12:28.629 --> 00:12:28.639 align:start position:0%
courts having to be more involved
 
00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:31.720 align:start position:0%
because of the ongoing issues it will
 
00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:34.160 align:start position:0%
perpetuate we heard that these bills
 
00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
could live in harmony together but I
 
00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:39.240 align:start position:0%
disagree because of the concerns from
 
00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:42.040 align:start position:0%
several stakeholders that 1595 does not
 
00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:43.880 align:start position:0%
put the well-being of the child first I
 
00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:45.800 align:start position:0%
still believe strongly that we should
 
00:12:48.069 --> 00:12:48.079 align:start position:0%
consider a motion of interim study where
 
00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
we can do some serious work and dig into
 
00:12:54.189 --> 00:12:54.199 align:start position:0%
how we can address these concerns and
 
00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
while I don't really expect I'm going to
 
00:12:59.230 --> 00:12:59.240 align:start position:0%
be changing anyone's thoughts minds or
 
00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:00.269 align:start position:0%
be changing anyone's thoughts minds or
votes

00:13:00.269 --> 00:13:00.279 align:start position:0%
votes
 
00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:02.600 align:start position:0%
today I would like to thank the division
 
00:13:04.949 --> 00:13:04.959 align:start position:0%
for giving me the opportunity to explain
 
00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
my objection to the action that had been
 
00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
taken earlier this week thank you
 
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.990 align:start position:0%
taken earlier this week thank you
representative

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:17.240 align:start position:0%
wer the bill came to us as figuring out
 
00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:19.000 align:start position:0%
parent time and dividing it and what did
 
00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:21.160 align:start position:0%
it cost you're trying to introduce a
 
00:13:24.069 --> 00:13:24.079 align:start position:0%
whole new topic which is not this policy
 
00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
in this committee it might be something
 
00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:28.600 align:start position:0%
that needs to be addressed but it's not
 
00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
something that
 
00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:32.440 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with what came to us and
 
00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
and if we make a a change to it it
 
00:13:37.069 --> 00:13:37.079 align:start position:0%
should be based upon how it affects the
 
00:13:39.629 --> 00:13:39.639 align:start position:0%
money spent and not say oh you left out
 
00:13:41.629 --> 00:13:41.639 align:start position:0%
this and you left out that that should
 
00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:44.240 align:start position:0%
go back to Children and Family Law and
 
00:13:46.389 --> 00:13:46.399 align:start position:0%
that should be a bill they they bring to
 
00:13:49.189 --> 00:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
us not having us do some policy change
 
00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:53.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
you thank you well I appreciate that
 
00:13:58.389 --> 00:13:58.399 align:start position:0%
comment I think I have seen some
 
00:14:00.269 --> 00:14:00.279 align:start position:0%
adjustments to policy work happen in
 
00:14:03.949 --> 00:14:03.959 align:start position:0%
this committee and um I am simply
 
00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
expressing my concerns and objection
 
00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
over the vote that was
 
00:14:12.189 --> 00:14:12.199 align:start position:0%
taken may I ask you a question do do you
 
00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
know if there's a companion bill to to
 
00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
um 1595 that's coming out of the senate
 
00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
or and the second question just so you
 
00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:24.440 align:start position:0%
know them both is if there's not would
 
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
would you would you commit to continuing
 
00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
to work with the Senate so that they
 
00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:31.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
concerns cuz we're not done right this
 
00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:36.440 align:start position:0%
is just a house
 
00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:38.720 align:start position:0%
position I actually don't specifically
 
00:14:39.749 --> 00:14:39.759 align:start position:0%
know I don't know if one of The
 
00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
Advocates knows if there is a a senate
 
00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
version of
 
00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:48.030 align:start position:0%
version of
this

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:48.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:51.320 align:start position:0%
um I would be I'm I'm not seeing anyone
 
00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:53.320 align:start position:0%
raise their hand or anything so I think
 
00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:55.720 align:start position:0%
that's probably a good conclusion so so
 
00:14:58.670 --> 00:14:58.680 align:start position:0%
then the second one would just be if if
 
00:15:01.749 --> 00:15:01.759 align:start position:0%
uh if this were to pass the house 1595
 
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
as amended would you be willing to
 
00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:08.600 align:start position:0%
continue to work with the Senate because
 
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
they'll they'll be picking up this bill
 
00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:13.720 align:start position:0%
and reviewing it well I do know that um
 
00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:15.880 align:start position:0%
having spoken to uh representative
 
00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:17.240 align:start position:0%
priest has spoken to representative
 
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
maiori who is um a person who has been
 
00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:23.000 align:start position:0%
supportive of 1595 uh he expressed
 
00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:25.720 align:start position:0%
interest in joining a working group to
 
00:15:27.949 --> 00:15:27.959 align:start position:0%
work on this um as well as
 
00:15:30.269 --> 00:15:30.279 align:start position:0%
representative Greg
 
00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
um if that's not possible I'm sure that
 
00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:34.360 align:start position:0%
they will be following the bill over to
 
00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
the Senate
 
00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
also just so you know I did get a couple
 
00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:40.680 align:start position:0%
messages from uh representative Greg
 
00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
this morning and she's very interested
 
00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:45.680 align:start position:0%
in your in supporting your position on
 
00:15:48.749 --> 00:15:48.759 align:start position:0%
this uh representative
 
00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:51.480 align:start position:0%
hle thank you Mr chairman um thank you
 
00:15:54.269 --> 00:15:54.279 align:start position:0%
for sharing I could tell from the tone
 
00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
that this this is a tough bill um not
 
00:15:58.949 --> 00:15:58.959 align:start position:0%
having been there right I haven't lived
 
00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
through some of the heartaches that
 
00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:02.240 align:start position:0%
various families have both here in the
 
00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
committee potentially as well as um the
 
00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
citizens of New
 
00:16:09.749 --> 00:16:09.759 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I think I think you make a
 
00:16:11.829 --> 00:16:11.839 align:start position:0%
a valid point about not trying to use
 
00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
the children as pawns right that we
 
00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
don't want to weaponize government at
 
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
any level um I could probably easily
 
00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:22.720 align:start position:0%
speak and become very emotional about
 
00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:24.920 align:start position:0%
how I can see government weaponized in
 
00:16:28.509 --> 00:16:28.519 align:start position:0%
some form and then children become um
 
00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:31.000 align:start position:0%
become the darts that families use
 
00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
against one
 
00:16:36.269 --> 00:16:36.279 align:start position:0%
another I think there's an element under
 
00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:38.920 align:start position:0%
this that that might be happening anyway
 
00:16:41.389 --> 00:16:41.399 align:start position:0%
unfortunately and we do need to account
 
00:16:44.189 --> 00:16:44.199 align:start position:0%
for the real costs that happen when you
 
00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:46.160 align:start position:0%
are taking care of a child for some
 
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
period of time and I think there's an
 
00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:51.839 align:start position:0%
element of some and I my background
 
00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
being in in the math and science Fields
 
00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
I always think about things that are a
 
00:16:56.309 --> 00:16:56.319 align:start position:0%
lot easier if there's an equation that
 
00:16:59.069 --> 00:16:59.079 align:start position:0%
kind of defines what the rules are so my
 
00:17:01.309 --> 00:17:01.319 align:start position:0%
natural bench is to go that way and I
 
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
think there is value here in
 
00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:07.240 align:start position:0%
establishing some criteria relative to
 
00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:09.160 align:start position:0%
Parenting Time and costs I think those
 
00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:11.360 align:start position:0%
coupled together if you are in if you
 
00:17:12.909 --> 00:17:12.919 align:start position:0%
have one of your children with you there
 
00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
are real costs that happen and maybe I'm
 
00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:17.640 align:start position:0%
missing something and if I am missing
 
00:17:20.429 --> 00:17:20.439 align:start position:0%
something about the EXT the actual
 
00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
direct costs that are incurred when you
 
00:17:25.549 --> 00:17:25.559 align:start position:0%
are overseeing a child please let me
 
00:17:27.549 --> 00:17:27.559 align:start position:0%
know but I think coupling those two
 
00:17:29.669 --> 00:17:29.679 align:start position:0%
together has value the weaponization
 
00:17:31.549 --> 00:17:31.559 align:start position:0%
side needs to be fixed that's a
 
00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
completely in my eyes that's a
 
00:17:34.789 --> 00:17:34.799 align:start position:0%
completely separate issue because we've
 
00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:37.000 align:start position:0%
allowed government through the family
 
00:17:38.549 --> 00:17:38.559 align:start position:0%
court system the way it's structured
 
00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
today to have one spouse challenge
 
00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
another and to use the children as a
 
00:17:47.029 --> 00:17:47.039 align:start position:0%
means to attack their former spouse and
 
00:17:49.029 --> 00:17:49.039 align:start position:0%
I would love to fix that it's an it's an
 
00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
important issue because I've seen as
 
00:17:53.909 --> 00:17:53.919 align:start position:0%
we've made as we've made government more
 
00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:56.600 align:start position:0%
powerful in the management of these
 
00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:01.320 align:start position:0%
relationships easy it is easy to to use
 
00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
government to be the baseball bat to
 
00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:04.840 align:start position:0%
harm the other one including the use of
 
00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
the children so I mean I haven't
 
00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
experienced this personally in this
 
00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
domain but I I I sense the pain and I
 
00:18:14.029 --> 00:18:14.039 align:start position:0%
can feel the pain from you that you're
 
00:18:18.789 --> 00:18:18.799 align:start position:0%
sharing is there any way to that we can
 
00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
even with this bill with an amendment to
 
00:18:23.669 --> 00:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
stop weaponizing the government side and
 
00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
to decouple it from the cost side
 
00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
because I think there is the cost that
 
00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:28.120 align:start position:0%
we have to deal with right that's the
 
00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
finance side of the bill and we want to
 
00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:31.240 align:start position:0%
make sure that the parents that are
 
00:18:32.669 --> 00:18:32.679 align:start position:0%
overseeing their children and have them
 
00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:34.840 align:start position:0%
in their care are compensated for that
 
00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:39.720 align:start position:0%
time CU if it is split 50/50 that works
 
00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:41.720 align:start position:0%
my understanding today is some of the
 
00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
formulas are are very disadvantage are
 
00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
are are not fair and if there's someone
 
00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:51.080 align:start position:0%
in the audience please correct me if I'm
 
00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:52.760 align:start position:0%
wrong but I understand that when they
 
00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
start doing income comparisons there are
 
00:18:58.870 --> 00:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
times where it is really disinvent is a
 
00:19:00.669 --> 00:19:00.679 align:start position:0%
advantage to one family over the other
 
00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
the way the structure is done
 
00:19:05.909 --> 00:19:05.919 align:start position:0%
today and someone can speak to it
 
00:19:09.149 --> 00:19:09.159 align:start position:0%
representative Leon lay on lay on nice
 
00:19:11.789 --> 00:19:11.799 align:start position:0%
and plain not fancy I'm getting closer
 
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I'm the
 
00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:17.080 align:start position:0%
chairman of the special committee on DCF
 
00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
this issue of weaponization of children
 
00:19:20.789 --> 00:19:20.799 align:start position:0%
especially around this would be a very
 
00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:23.240 align:start position:0%
very important topic for us to work on
 
00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
and to dig into to be able to look not
 
00:19:27.909 --> 00:19:27.919 align:start position:0%
just not in the context of a bill but
 
00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
large large at this issue I would really
 
00:19:33.149 --> 00:19:33.159 align:start position:0%
appreciate you coming and joining us so
 
00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
that we can talk about this because I
 
00:19:37.149 --> 00:19:37.159 align:start position:0%
see that special committee as an
 
00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity to work into these
 
00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:41.000 align:start position:0%
underlying issues that are harder to
 
00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
address when we see a specific Bill
 
00:19:44.909 --> 00:19:44.919 align:start position:0%
coming to us but we have a chance to sit
 
00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
and talk through those different issues
 
00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:49.240 align:start position:0%
and bring people in and I think that
 
00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:51.320 align:start position:0%
that would be very valuable work and I
 
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
think I I would really like to ask you
 
00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:55.400 align:start position:0%
to come and work with us so that we can
 
00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
figure out how to deal with the issue of
 
00:19:58.909 --> 00:19:58.919 align:start position:0%
weaponization because whether we pass
 
00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
this bill or whether we inter room study
 
00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:02.320 align:start position:0%
this bill that's still an issue that's
 
00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
going on so let's try and tackle it as a
 
00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:08.360 align:start position:0%
distinct issue um because we need to
 
00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
that are there further comments from the
 
00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:19.880 align:start position:0%
division on this uh and for those
 
00:20:22.029 --> 00:20:22.039 align:start position:0%
sitting out here wondering why I haven't
 
00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
gone to you this is a a work session
 
00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
this is the time where we're really
 
00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:28.120 align:start position:0%
supposed to be talking to each other
 
00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
about our vote votes and uh and so if
 
00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:35.320 align:start position:0%
there's factual things that we're saying
 
00:20:37.789 --> 00:20:37.799 align:start position:0%
wrong I'm interested in factual
 
00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:40.360 align:start position:0%
corrections but we're past the point of
 
00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
opinions so um representa
 
00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:48.760 align:start position:0%
Stringham thank you Mr chair um you know
 
00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
just just my perspective on this in in
 
00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
light of both bills um you know both
 
00:20:56.149 --> 00:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
bills had strong proponents
 
00:20:58.909 --> 00:20:58.919 align:start position:0%
1595 has PE has people who very
 
00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
concerned about what the implementation
 
00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:05.240 align:start position:0%
of 1595 might mean might mean for
 
00:21:08.909 --> 00:21:08.919 align:start position:0%
families uh in my view that was uh a
 
00:21:11.669 --> 00:21:11.679 align:start position:0%
topic that was uh discussed in the floor
 
00:21:15.669 --> 00:21:15.679 align:start position:0%
it's a matter of policy uh 1595 passed
 
00:21:18.909 --> 00:21:18.919 align:start position:0%
by over 50 votes it was not a straight
 
00:21:22.149 --> 00:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
Partyline vote you know very very close
 
00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
and um uh the discussions that we've had
 
00:21:27.669 --> 00:21:27.679 align:start position:0%
here in committee as well as discussions
 
00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:30.440 align:start position:0%
I've had outside side uh I think there's
 
00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
been meaningful efforts to make sure
 
00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
that if both bills are passed that um
 
00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:38.440 align:start position:0%
that there's no uh inconsistency that
 
00:21:41.789 --> 00:21:41.799 align:start position:0%
can't be uh fully implemented so then
 
00:21:47.549 --> 00:21:47.559 align:start position:0%
you know uh and um uh you know I think I
 
00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:49.480 align:start position:0%
think the issues of whether this is good
 
00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
policy or not is still there um but in
 
00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
terms of the house I think the house has
 
00:21:58.149 --> 00:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
spoken on that issue at this point and
 
00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
so the issue really for for me is about
 
00:22:03.669 --> 00:22:03.679 align:start position:0%
Finance if um and
 
00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
um uh with
 
00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
1564 um being being passed and um on a
 
00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:13.240 align:start position:0%
unanimous basis or near
 
00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:15.400 align:start position:0%
unanimous uh I I don't see any
 
00:22:18.149 --> 00:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
implementation costs of1 15595 that we
 
00:22:23.549 --> 00:22:23.559 align:start position:0%
have to deal with uh so um I appreciate
 
00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:27.240 align:start position:0%
that the that 1595 has been amended so
 
00:22:29.909 --> 00:22:29.919 align:start position:0%
that there's no difference in definition
 
00:22:32.549 --> 00:22:32.559 align:start position:0%
that are used so to make it simpler for
 
00:22:35.029 --> 00:22:35.039 align:start position:0%
the Department to implement I do expect
 
00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:37.880 align:start position:0%
there to be a vigorous debate about uh
 
00:22:40.029 --> 00:22:40.039 align:start position:0%
whether this is good policy uh in the
 
00:22:41.909 --> 00:22:41.919 align:start position:0%
Senate and the continuation part of the
 
00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:44.600 align:start position:0%
view but I think in terms of the job
 
00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:47.080 align:start position:0%
that I've been asked to do um I'm going
 
00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
to uh I still will support uh aop pass
 
00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:53.110 align:start position:0%
to uh I still will support uh aop pass
on

00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:56.240 align:start position:0%
1595 represent torski I just I just want
 
00:22:57.909 --> 00:22:57.919 align:start position:0%
to be clear that I am fully aware of the
 
00:22:59.350 --> 00:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
amount of time that we've put into this
 
00:23:01.669 --> 00:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
and I thank everyone and I thank the
 
00:23:03.909 --> 00:23:03.919 align:start position:0%
people who have been working with um
 
00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:05.960 align:start position:0%
both the policy committee and us on this
 
00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:10.240 align:start position:0%
I don't need to dig it any deeper um if
 
00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:14.600 align:start position:0%
we were to take another vote I would not
 
00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:16.760 align:start position:0%
support the opop pass as amended similar
 
00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:19.480 align:start position:0%
to the other day my preference if the
 
00:23:21.269 --> 00:23:21.279 align:start position:0%
opop pass as amended did not pass would
 
00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:24.440 align:start position:0%
be a motion of interim study um but I am
 
00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:26.720 align:start position:0%
fine with moving it along so that the
 
00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
division can have a final um
 
00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
position to bring to the full finance
 
00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:34.720 align:start position:0%
committee so I I think we should go
 
00:23:40.029 --> 00:23:40.039 align:start position:0%
ahead and entertain a fresh uh motion on
 
00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:45.200 align:start position:0%
1595 uh and this would obviate what we
 
00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:47.960 align:start position:0%
said in work session on Monday regard
 
00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
depending on how how the vote turns out
 
00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:54.320 align:start position:0%
but I would entertain a fresh motion uh
 
00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
on uh House Bill
 
00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:59.549 align:start position:0%
on uh House Bill
1595

00:23:59.549 --> 00:23:59.559 align:start position:0%
1595
 
00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:03.240 align:start position:0%

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:04.470 align:start position:0%

um
 
00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
this amendment was drafted upon the
 
00:27:29.789 --> 00:27:29.799 align:start position:0%
guidance of um the department
 
00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:32.720 align:start position:0%
where uh we wanted to clarify a few
 
00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:34.760 align:start position:0%
things about the employee assistance
 
00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
program um I don't have the highlighted
 
00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:38.440 align:start position:0%
Parts in front of me but I'm pretty sure
 
00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
we added in the current members of the
 
00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
general court and household members
 
00:27:44.669 --> 00:27:44.679 align:start position:0%
shall be permitted to participate I'm
 
00:27:46.789 --> 00:27:46.799 align:start position:0%
pretty sure that was added in there and
 
00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:49.880 align:start position:0%
then there was a line added at the end
 
00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
nothing in this section shall be
 
00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:53.080 align:start position:0%
construed that members of the general
 
00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:56.200 align:start position:0%
court are employees or otherwise deemed
 
00:27:57.710 --> 00:27:57.720 align:start position:0%
anything but members of the legislative
 
00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:00.360 align:start position:0%
branch in order to clarify that we are
 
00:28:03.389 --> 00:28:03.399 align:start position:0%
not employees and do not fall under that
 
00:28:05.789 --> 00:28:05.799 align:start position:0%
whatever that umbrella might lead to um
 
00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:08.360 align:start position:0%
which was one of the concerns uh raised
 
00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
here in division um and
 
00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:13.880 align:start position:0%
finally the amendment changes the
 
00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:17.320 align:start position:0%
effective date pushes it way far out to
 
00:28:21.789 --> 00:28:21.799 align:start position:0%
January 1st 2027 to be clear that
 
00:28:25.669 --> 00:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
um there would be uh no apparent benefit
 
00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:28.120 align:start position:0%
to any one of us as we are not sure who
 
00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:30.760 align:start position:0%
who would actually be um in the general
 
00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
court in 2027 to take advantage of um
 
00:28:41.230 --> 00:28:41.240 align:start position:0%
the program so um the prime sponsor um
 
00:28:44.549 --> 00:28:44.559 align:start position:0%
reached out to me after the hearing to
 
00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
say this is the preferred amendment that
 
00:28:51.669 --> 00:28:51.679 align:start position:0%
she wanted um and asked me to file it so
 
00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
I presented to the division for
 
00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:55.320 align:start position:0%
consideration and I hope you'll be able
 
00:28:57.310 --> 00:28:57.320 align:start position:0%
to support it because I believe it
 
00:28:59.350 --> 00:28:59.360 align:start position:0%
addresses many of the concerns if not
 
00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:01.720 align:start position:0%
all the concerns that were brought up
 
00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:02.630 align:start position:0%
all the concerns that were brought up
thank

00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
you is there any further discussion
 
00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:08.440 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham yeah I'm I I I
 
00:29:11.389 --> 00:29:11.399 align:start position:0%
did hear that I you know I thought the
 
00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:13.720 align:start position:0%
idea of having this fairly inexpensive
 
00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
support available while we're all uh
 
00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
incredibly strong uh uh and you know
 
00:29:23.269 --> 00:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
talented people that can take care of
 
00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
ourselves this still things sneak up on
 
00:29:29.789 --> 00:29:29.799 align:start position:0%
people even even uh top people like the
 
00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
ones I have the pleasure of working with
 
00:29:35.269 --> 00:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
here in the legislature and um uh and
 
00:29:37.029 --> 00:29:37.039 align:start position:0%
while we're not employees we are a
 
00:29:40.909 --> 00:29:40.919 align:start position:0%
Workforce and um uh and not only that
 
00:29:43.909 --> 00:29:43.919 align:start position:0%
we're uh a group group of people that's
 
00:29:45.669 --> 00:29:45.679 align:start position:0%
chosen to give up a lot of their free
 
00:29:51.509 --> 00:29:51.519 align:start position:0%
time uh to serve here and um uh uh you
 
00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:53.640 align:start position:0%
know the kind of things that pop up are
 
00:29:57.269 --> 00:29:57.279 align:start position:0%
not are not things that uh people expect
 
00:29:59.070 --> 00:29:59.080 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:30:03.669 --> 00:30:03.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
um and you know I felt like the the
 
00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:08.320 align:start position:0%
group here kind of felt that yeah it
 
00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:10.120 align:start position:0%
makes sense that under those types of
 
00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
circumstances to have something
 
00:30:17.269 --> 00:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
available the real issue is um uh is
 
00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
we're not employees and it's called an
 
00:30:23.789 --> 00:30:23.799 align:start position:0%
employee assistance program and
 
00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
um and uh you know in in the strong need
 
00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
for a bit of bit of Comedy last night
 
00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:33.960 align:start position:0%
after you know pretty long day in here I
 
00:30:35.669 --> 00:30:35.679 align:start position:0%
kind of wanted to think what could we
 
00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
call it if it's not an employee
 
00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
assistance program that applies to the
 
00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:43.640 align:start position:0%
legislature and so I played around and I
 
00:30:46.909 --> 00:30:46.919 align:start position:0%
came up with the name legislature urgent
 
00:30:48.669 --> 00:30:48.679 align:start position:0%
resource crisis
 
00:30:52.389 --> 00:30:52.399 align:start position:0%
hotline so it calls into the same
 
00:30:55.789 --> 00:30:55.799 align:start position:0%
company same people same thing but we
 
00:30:58.430 --> 00:30:58.440 align:start position:0%
just we just use the acronym lurch
 
00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
so if you call it your cell phone would
 
00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:03.080 align:start position:0%
come up with this picture and somebody
 
00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:10.960 align:start position:0%
rang and um you know there's there's
 
00:31:12.789 --> 00:31:12.799 align:start position:0%
outside groups that manage employee
 
00:31:15.669 --> 00:31:15.679 align:start position:0%
assistance program there's no reason a
 
00:31:17.669 --> 00:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
phone different phone number couldn't go
 
00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:20.480 align:start position:0%
into the same place there's no reason
 
00:31:22.509 --> 00:31:22.519 align:start position:0%
that the such a program couldn't be run
 
00:31:25.629 --> 00:31:25.639 align:start position:0%
by the nurse give out give out a little
 
00:31:29.629 --> 00:31:29.639 align:start position:0%
card um I mean I still I I think the the
 
00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:32.360 align:start position:0%
amendment is fine but I I would
 
00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
encourage um you know the house and the
 
00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:37.240 align:start position:0%
and the government to make this kind of
 
00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:40.480 align:start position:0%
service available uh for the the great
 
00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:42.360 align:start position:0%
people who are who are compromising so
 
00:31:44.149 --> 00:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
much I mean it's nice to that they
 
00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
bought us a 100 pizzas last night uh and
 
00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
uh huh they didn't who bought it your
 
00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
people the party bought it huh the party
 
00:31:57.029 --> 00:31:57.039 align:start position:0%
bought it well for you we were you you
 
00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:09.629 --> 00:32:09.639 align:start position:0%
was well you know Ju Just because we're
 
00:32:13.389 --> 00:32:13.399 align:start position:0%
not employees and uh and you're not an
 
00:32:15.629 --> 00:32:15.639 align:start position:0%
employee doesn't mean that I think this
 
00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:19.240 align:start position:0%
kind of service and support um uh would
 
00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:22.480 align:start position:0%
be helpful so um I'm going to support
 
00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:26.120 align:start position:0%
the amendment and uh and would would
 
00:32:27.269 --> 00:32:27.279 align:start position:0%
would encourage that this kind of
 
00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:29.080 align:start position:0%
service be available regardless of the
 
00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:31.000 align:start position:0%
ultimate status of this
 
00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:35.000 align:start position:0%
bill so to clarify uh when you said
 
00:32:39.269 --> 00:32:39.279 align:start position:0%
comedy you you meant c m Ty Y and not
 
00:32:39.279 --> 00:32:40.669 align:start position:0%
comedy you you meant c m Ty Y and not
comedy

00:32:40.669 --> 00:32:40.679 align:start position:0%
comedy
 
00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
obviously right because you're sticking
 
00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
to your day job I think but
 
00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
uh okay so the to the extent that you
 
00:32:52.669 --> 00:32:52.679 align:start position:0%
have anything serious with the Lurch
 
00:32:55.269 --> 00:32:55.279 align:start position:0%
thing that's kind of funny
 
00:32:58.990 --> 00:32:59.000 align:start position:0%
uh if this goes into effect in 27 then
 
00:33:01.029 --> 00:33:01.039 align:start position:0%
then there could be a bill next year to
 
00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
you know tweak it so that there might be
 
00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
different phone numbers I I I don't know
 
00:33:07.269 --> 00:33:07.279 align:start position:0%
that would I I don't I don't think you
 
00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:10.240 align:start position:0%
mean to change this amendment today no I
 
00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
don't mean to change the amendment all
 
00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:15.440 align:start position:0%
right but I I I did want to say you know
 
00:33:18.269 --> 00:33:18.279 align:start position:0%
sometimes semantics matter and there's
 
00:33:20.149 --> 00:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
no there's no difference between
 
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
somebody calling up a phone number and
 
00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:24.440 align:start position:0%
having it be an employee assistance
 
00:33:26.629 --> 00:33:26.639 align:start position:0%
program or having it being the
 
00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:29.960 align:start position:0%
legislature uh support Hotline Crisis
 
00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:32.440 align:start position:0%
Hotline uh if they handle the calls the
 
00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
same way but it may feel different to
 
00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
some some of us who are voting on it and
 
00:33:39.789 --> 00:33:39.799 align:start position:0%
uh and you know the incredibly ALU
 
00:33:41.909 --> 00:33:41.919 align:start position:0%
altruistic purpose by which we come here
 
00:33:43.789 --> 00:33:43.799 align:start position:0%
and serve we're not we're not here we're
 
00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
not here to get some benefit that we
 
00:33:47.669 --> 00:33:47.679 align:start position:0%
can't get somewhere else the this the
 
00:33:49.509 --> 00:33:49.519 align:start position:0%
small thing that could still be out
 
00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:53.080 align:start position:0%
there would be to in my view is um we we
 
00:33:55.389 --> 00:33:55.399 align:start position:0%
heard that conflict resolution was among
 
00:33:57.990 --> 00:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
the services and I think the conflict
 
00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:01.240 align:start position:0%
resolution in between which parties
 
00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
might need to be clarified I don't think
 
00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
conflict resolutions between members of
 
00:34:08.589 --> 00:34:08.599 align:start position:0%
the general court would be appropriate
 
00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:10.240 align:start position:0%
you know if they're having conflict
 
00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
issues with the neighbor or something
 
00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
that's stressing them out that would be
 
00:34:18.430 --> 00:34:18.440 align:start position:0%
fine but I so so actually I think if we
 
00:34:20.629 --> 00:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
do accept this there would still be some
 
00:34:23.470 --> 00:34:23.480 align:start position:0%
tweaks that would be needed next term
 
00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
but um representative Wier
 
00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:30.760 align:start position:0%
I still don't like the Optics of us
 
00:34:32.430 --> 00:34:32.440 align:start position:0%
trying to get onto something that's an
 
00:34:35.829 --> 00:34:35.839 align:start position:0%
employee program that was created for
 
00:34:38.869 --> 00:34:38.879 align:start position:0%
employees we all have other ways of
 
00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
supporting ourselves obviously because
 
00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
we're not supported on what we get paid
 
00:34:45.069 --> 00:34:45.079 align:start position:0%
here and we all have other other forms
 
00:34:50.349 --> 00:34:50.359 align:start position:0%
of of income and and support so I think
 
00:34:53.109 --> 00:34:53.119 align:start position:0%
that this this is not something and I
 
00:34:55.589 --> 00:34:55.599 align:start position:0%
think that it much could be made of it
 
00:34:57.470 --> 00:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
anybody that voted for it somebody that
 
00:34:59.270 --> 00:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
was was running against you could say oh
 
00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
you want everything the employees want
 
00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
and you're only working so many hours
 
00:35:05.349 --> 00:35:05.359 align:start position:0%
you know a lot some of our colleagues
 
00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:09.320 align:start position:0%
work a lot fewer hours than we do and uh
 
00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:10.720 align:start position:0%
you know it's so and some of them
 
00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
deliberately do that and don't show up
 
00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
much you'd be giving them a privilege
 
00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:17.160 align:start position:0%
that they didn't earn much so I I don't
 
00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:18.230 align:start position:0%
that they didn't earn much so I I don't
support

00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:35:23.109 --> 00:35:23.119 align:start position:0%
it representative H thank you Mr chair
 
00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:25.640 align:start position:0%
um I do thank you um representative
 
00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
torski for coming up with an amendment
 
00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
to is at least constitutional per our US
 
00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:33.240 align:start position:0%
Constitution Article
 
00:35:36.589 --> 00:35:36.599 align:start position:0%
27 um I still have concerns and my
 
00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:38.920 align:start position:0%
concerns stem from the number of
 
00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
citizens in the town in my towns um that
 
00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
don't have access to this they're
 
00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:47.720 align:start position:0%
retired they're they work for themselves
 
00:35:49.349 --> 00:35:49.359 align:start position:0%
whatever their life condition is that
 
00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
puts them in a place that they don't
 
00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:52.640 align:start position:0%
have access to an employee assistance
 
00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:55.720 align:start position:0%
number um we do get calls we get calls
 
00:35:58.309 --> 00:35:58.319 align:start position:0%
for all sorts of things as a State Rep
 
00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
it sometimes is even relative to what's
 
00:36:02.309 --> 00:36:02.319 align:start position:0%
going on in the town even though we're
 
00:36:04.349 --> 00:36:04.359 align:start position:0%
not doing necessarily local politics if
 
00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:05.800 align:start position:0%
there's a problem between a building in
 
00:36:08.309 --> 00:36:08.319 align:start position:0%
inspector and and one of the citizens I
 
00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
I get the phone
 
00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:13.240 align:start position:0%
call and I want to make sure that we are
 
00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:15.400 align:start position:0%
as close as possible to the people that
 
00:36:18.349 --> 00:36:18.359 align:start position:0%
we serve um I think that's important so
 
00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
if they don't have access to this level
 
00:36:22.109 --> 00:36:22.119 align:start position:0%
of benefit um I don't know that I would
 
00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
want to have it for us so with that I'm
 
00:36:25.309 --> 00:36:25.319 align:start position:0%
going to be voting
 
00:36:28.349 --> 00:36:28.359 align:start position:0%
no further comment uh representative
 
00:36:31.109 --> 00:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
priest thank you Mr chairman I will be
 
00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
voting uh in support of
 
00:36:35.950 --> 00:36:35.960 align:start position:0%
HB uh
 
00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
13 63 and the amendment that's been
 
00:36:43.069 --> 00:36:43.079 align:start position:0%
offered uh today I think this is a very
 
00:36:47.349 --> 00:36:47.359 align:start position:0%
valuable service for uh the general
 
00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:50.720 align:start position:0%
court and for the amount of money that
 
00:36:53.470 --> 00:36:53.480 align:start position:0%
is the cost of
 
00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
it the services clearly
 
00:36:59.829 --> 00:36:59.839 align:start position:0%
outweighs the cost of it and I think
 
00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:02.280 align:start position:0%
it's something that all of the general
 
00:37:05.710 --> 00:37:05.720 align:start position:0%
court can use uh and
 
00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
I and that's I think it's important
 
00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:09.829 align:start position:0%
I and that's I think it's important
thank

00:37:09.829 --> 00:37:09.839 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:12.880 align:start position:0%
you further discussion I I I want to
 
00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:15.240 align:start position:0%
break this into two two separate things
 
00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
first we'll consider the amendment and
 
00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
after we know what we want to do with
 
00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
the amendment we'll talk about we'll
 
00:37:22.510 --> 00:37:22.520 align:start position:0%
vote on the underlying Bill did you have
 
00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:24.349 align:start position:0%
vote on the underlying Bill did you have
another

00:37:24.349 --> 00:37:24.359 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:26.800 align:start position:0%
comment in response to the last comment
 
00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:29.160 align:start position:0%
that was made I don't want anybody to
 
00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
think that I don't see the value of
 
00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:33.720 align:start position:0%
these of these Services I do think in
 
00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:36.640 align:start position:0%
fact they're valuable um I don't know if
 
00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:38.960 align:start position:0%
their approach is the correct one to
 
00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:40.440 align:start position:0%
extend it from the employees that are
 
00:37:42.589 --> 00:37:42.599 align:start position:0%
part of state government to the
 
00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:44.680 align:start position:0%
legislature I think we need to figure
 
00:37:46.990 --> 00:37:47.000 align:start position:0%
out whether we need a crisis hotline or
 
00:37:49.109 --> 00:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
something else as a better solution I
 
00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:52.240 align:start position:0%
mean last fall I got broadsided by
 
00:37:54.430 --> 00:37:54.440 align:start position:0%
something I would never have expected
 
00:37:57.630 --> 00:37:57.640 align:start position:0%
and spent the better part of six weeks
 
00:37:58.990 --> 00:37:59.000 align:start position:0%
going through something with an
 
00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
immediate family member that left me in
 
00:38:05.309 --> 00:38:05.319 align:start position:0%
crisis um I spent several nights on the
 
00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:08.200 align:start position:0%
cement floor at ham sorry at um Elliott
 
00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:10.200 align:start position:0%
Hospital sitting next to somebody I
 
00:38:12.829 --> 00:38:12.839 align:start position:0%
cared about or sleeping next to someone
 
00:38:14.069 --> 00:38:14.079 align:start position:0%
I cared
 
00:38:17.069 --> 00:38:17.079 align:start position:0%
about I understand that life some
 
00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
sometimes throws us tough challenges and
 
00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:21.880 align:start position:0%
we we do need a network but I don't
 
00:38:23.349 --> 00:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
think in
 
00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
my I even going through that personally
 
00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
I don't think I can make the argument we
 
00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:29.200 align:start position:0%
should extend this to to the members of
 
00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
the general court and not figure out how
 
00:38:33.309 --> 00:38:33.319 align:start position:0%
to do something similar or broader for
 
00:38:33.319 --> 00:38:35.069 align:start position:0%
to do something similar or broader for
our

00:38:35.069 --> 00:38:35.079 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:37.880 align:start position:0%

00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
yes chairman Edwards
 
00:41:38.430 --> 00:41:38.440 align:start position:0%
no okay so the vote uh being um uh four
 
00:41:42.349 --> 00:41:42.359 align:start position:0%
Ys five Nays uh the motion uh ought to
 
00:41:45.309 --> 00:41:45.319 align:start position:0%
pass uh
 
00:41:48.910 --> 00:41:48.920 align:start position:0%
fails so we need an alternative
 
00:41:54.309 --> 00:41:54.319 align:start position:0%
motion I'll move itl second seconded who
 
00:41:55.349 --> 00:41:55.359 align:start position:0%
was the
 
00:41:58.710 --> 00:41:58.720 align:start position:0%
second neor
 
00:42:01.710 --> 00:42:01.720 align:start position:0%
I yell out next time well I heard
 
00:42:04.990 --> 00:42:05.000 align:start position:0%
multiple yeses so
 
00:42:09.829 --> 00:42:09.839 align:start position:0%
twice so uh the motion is itl
 
00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
um uh before we vote is there any
 
00:42:15.510 --> 00:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
discussion on the new
 
00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:19.160 align:start position:0%
Amendment or excuse me the new motion
 
00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:21.240 align:start position:0%

Edwards
 
00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
yes the vote being five to four uh the
 
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:52.480 align:start position:0%
passes so we're going to need somebody
 
00:42:57.950 --> 00:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
to to write a blurb for and a blurb uh
 
00:42:59.950 --> 00:42:59.960 align:start position:0%
against shouldn't we wait do we have a
 
00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
blurb for the full finance and we we
 
00:43:06.510 --> 00:43:06.520 align:start position:0%
will but the drafting process can begin
 
00:43:09.710 --> 00:43:09.720 align:start position:0%
okay okay and and I just want to give
 
00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:12.680 align:start position:0%
everyone an opportunity to use whatever
 
00:43:14.670 --> 00:43:14.680 align:start position:0%
time they have available to write it
 
00:43:18.069 --> 00:43:18.079 align:start position:0%
well I saw representative Wier the other
 
00:43:21.910 --> 00:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
day uh when he was going uh in the full
 
00:43:25.470 --> 00:43:25.480 align:start position:0%
finance committee he read the blurb as
 
00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
part of his uh testimony money and that
 
00:43:31.309 --> 00:43:31.319 align:start position:0%
seemed to be pretty slick because it he
 
00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
one he got it done in time and two it
 
00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
helped clarify what we were voting on so
 
00:43:40.510 --> 00:43:40.520 align:start position:0%
um who who would who would be writing
 
00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:50.480 align:start position:0%
itl h I'll do it that's the whole and
 
00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:52.640 align:start position:0%
I'll do the Minority Report when we get
 
00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
to that point Okay
 
00:43:56.040 --> 00:44:00.589 align:start position:0%
to that point Okay
so

00:44:00.589 --> 00:44:00.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:03.270 --> 00:44:03.280 align:start position:0%
but I'm going to hope for the best it'll
 
00:44:05.589 --> 00:44:05.599 align:start position:0%
be it'll be the majority it's good to be
 
00:44:05.599 --> 00:44:06.349 align:start position:0%
be it'll be the majority it's good to be
an

00:44:06.349 --> 00:44:06.359 align:start position:0%
an
 
00:44:10.349 --> 00:44:10.359 align:start position:0%
optimist um okay so on
 
00:44:13.630 --> 00:44:13.640 align:start position:0%
1588 uh House Bill 158 Point order go
 
00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:15.240 align:start position:0%
ahead I'm just curious are you skipping
 
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
1669 on purpose or did I miss something
 
00:44:19.710 --> 00:44:19.720 align:start position:0%
no I I had changed the order on my sheet
 
00:44:21.870 --> 00:44:21.880 align:start position:0%
of paper and it wasn't really clear to
 
00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
you I I I'm it's it's next uh House Bill
 
00:44:27.790 --> 00:44:27.800 align:start position:0%
uh 15
 
00:44:30.829 --> 00:44:30.839 align:start position:0%
88 uh relative to court jurisdiction
 
00:44:34.030 --> 00:44:34.040 align:start position:0%
over persons receiving special education
 
00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:36.520 align:start position:0%
my note says we needed better numbers is
 
00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
there anyone in the audience that are
 
00:44:42.349 --> 00:44:42.359 align:start position:0%
here to present better
 
00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
numbers how about you Mr Ripple did you
 
00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:46.720 align:start position:0%
get any better numbers Mr White do you
 
00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
have better numbers because we we didn't
 
00:44:51.549 --> 00:44:51.559 align:start position:0%
we haven't this is one where we never
 
00:44:53.790 --> 00:44:53.800 align:start position:0%
felt that we really had good numbers I
 
00:44:56.030 --> 00:44:56.040 align:start position:0%
haven't received any updates
 
00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:58.710 align:start position:0%
haven't received any updates
no

00:44:58.710 --> 00:44:58.720 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:44:59.870 --> 00:44:59.880 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of the committee
 
00:45:01.349 --> 00:45:01.359 align:start position:0%
Nathan white Chief Financial Officer of
 
00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:02.640 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
Services and uh to clarify
 
00:45:06.349 --> 00:45:06.359 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards when you're
 
00:45:08.069 --> 00:45:08.079 align:start position:0%
better numbers this is on the on the
 
00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:10.480 align:start position:0%
specific assumptions in the fiscal note
 
00:45:12.349 --> 00:45:12.359 align:start position:0%
that the department used for the 32
 
00:45:12.359 --> 00:45:13.790 align:start position:0%
that the department used for the 32
count

00:45:13.790 --> 00:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
count
 
00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:16.200 align:start position:0%
correct right and then there was a lot
 
00:45:19.150 --> 00:45:19.160 align:start position:0%
of testimony and and uh that seemed like
 
00:45:21.870 --> 00:45:21.880 align:start position:0%
it was going to change or reduce those
 
00:45:25.230 --> 00:45:25.240 align:start position:0%
estimates and what I think we asked was
 
00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
just nothing official in a fiscal note
 
00:45:31.589 --> 00:45:31.599 align:start position:0%
but um a clarification of what we think
 
00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
the new order of magnitude would be
 
00:45:37.349 --> 00:45:37.359 align:start position:0%
based on the discussions sure so we went
 
00:45:38.549 --> 00:45:38.559 align:start position:0%
back and we looked at the original
 
00:45:42.430 --> 00:45:42.440 align:start position:0%
methodology that we had used and um we
 
00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
made an assumption that 3% of the total
 
00:45:47.710 --> 00:45:47.720 align:start position:0%
population would be eligible and then we
 
00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:56.349 --> 00:45:56.359 align:start position:0%
sample oh she step out okay um we
 
00:45:59.270 --> 00:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
recently pulled a an upto-date sample
 
00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
that verified that there I believe there
 
00:46:04.510 --> 00:46:04.520 align:start position:0%
were 32 individuals today in that age
 
00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
group that would Age into the new
 
00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:09.240 align:start position:0%
eligibility so our original assumptions
 
00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:18.520 align:start position:0%
accurate so so you've uh reinds the
 
00:46:21.470 --> 00:46:21.480 align:start position:0%
original fiscal note that attached to
 
00:46:26.270 --> 00:46:26.280 align:start position:0%
1588 correct okay um representative
 
00:46:30.230 --> 00:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
Earth ju just to clarify so
 
00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
you confirmed it was between a little
 
00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:35.800 align:start position:0%
under 2 million to six
 
00:46:41.349 --> 00:46:41.359 align:start position:0%
million a year and going up from there
 
00:46:44.589 --> 00:46:44.599 align:start position:0%
um we confirm the original census number
 
00:46:46.030 --> 00:46:46.040 align:start position:0%
so the original census number was based
 
00:46:48.349 --> 00:46:48.359 align:start position:0%
on a projection and so so the dollar
 
00:46:51.430 --> 00:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
figures again are variable they're our
 
00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
best estimate and the we provided a
 
00:46:54.829 --> 00:46:54.839 align:start position:0%
range because it's ultimately very
 
00:46:56.030 --> 00:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
dependent upon the service that that
 
00:46:58.950 --> 00:46:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:00.390 --> 00:47:00.400 align:start position:0%
except I thought you said you looked at
 
00:47:02.990 --> 00:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
these individuals
 
00:47:05.349 --> 00:47:05.359 align:start position:0%
so you did you look at the particular
 
00:47:06.829 --> 00:47:06.839 align:start position:0%
individuals or just the counts and then
 
00:47:09.230 --> 00:47:09.240 align:start position:0%
you went to the worst and best cases we
 
00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:12.440 align:start position:0%
we looked at we looked at the total
 
00:47:14.589 --> 00:47:14.599 align:start position:0%
number of individuals we did not go Case
 
00:47:16.190 --> 00:47:16.200 align:start position:0%
by casee and go down to the billing
 
00:47:18.750 --> 00:47:18.760 align:start position:0%
level detail of each individual um
 
00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
because when we're looking out to 26 and
 
00:47:24.589 --> 00:47:24.599 align:start position:0%
27 those Services could change and then
 
00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:26.200 align:start position:0%
in the long run those Services would
 
00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
also be WI dependent and variable okay
 
00:47:30.549 --> 00:47:30.559 align:start position:0%
so back to my question did you just so
 
00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
is your range a worst case and a best
 
00:47:36.589 --> 00:47:36.599 align:start position:0%
case is that the range yes okay so
 
00:47:39.150 --> 00:47:39.160 align:start position:0%
there's no such thing as a
 
00:47:43.150 --> 00:47:43.160 align:start position:0%
average in the world in this
 
00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:46.040 align:start position:0%
world that's why we we didn't provide an
 
00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:48.400 align:start position:0%
average because of because one it could
 
00:47:50.589 --> 00:47:50.599 align:start position:0%
vary like five years down the road those
 
00:47:51.990 --> 00:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
costs could be very different from two
 
00:47:53.309 --> 00:47:53.319 align:start position:0%
years down the road that's why we did
 
00:47:56.109 --> 00:47:56.119 align:start position:0%
not choose an average or a median okay
 
00:47:57.710 --> 00:47:57.720 align:start position:0%
all right I maybe nice is to know that
 
00:47:59.790 --> 00:47:59.800 align:start position:0%
you could have given us three values low
 
00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:07.790 --> 00:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
okay so so if we wanted to appropriate
 
00:48:12.670 --> 00:48:12.680 align:start position:0%
Pro um you so that you uh you can run
 
00:48:15.549 --> 00:48:15.559 align:start position:0%
your um the provide the services and run
 
00:48:17.870 --> 00:48:17.880 align:start position:0%
the department should we put the worst
 
00:48:21.069 --> 00:48:21.079 align:start position:0%
case in there or an average in terms of
 
00:48:24.030 --> 00:48:24.040 align:start position:0%
of uh how much uh funding we need to
 
00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate for this
 
00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:29.630 align:start position:0%
appropriate for this
bill

00:48:29.630 --> 00:48:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:31.589 --> 00:48:31.599 align:start position:0%
from a budgetary standpoint I would
 
00:48:33.109 --> 00:48:33.119 align:start position:0%
always want more but I'm also very
 
00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
respectful relative to The Limited funds
 
00:48:38.030 --> 00:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
that everybody has um I think some
 
00:48:40.069 --> 00:48:40.079 align:start position:0%
average would certainly be appreciated
 
00:48:41.870 --> 00:48:41.880 align:start position:0%
ultimately at the end of the day we're
 
00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
going to make sure that the services are
 
00:48:45.630 --> 00:48:45.640 align:start position:0%
provided and so when we bring forward a
 
00:48:47.790 --> 00:48:47.800 align:start position:0%
department-wide transfer to fiscal and
 
00:48:49.309 --> 00:48:49.319 align:start position:0%
you see us moving around millions of
 
00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
dollars it's to account for those
 
00:48:52.270 --> 00:48:52.280 align:start position:0%
discrepancies that deviate from our
 
00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:55.710 align:start position:0%
discrepancies that deviate from our
original

00:48:55.710 --> 00:48:55.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:57.589 align:start position:0%
 
assumptions

00:48:57.589 --> 00:48:57.599 align:start position:0%
assumptions
 
00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
the Mr Ripple this is as much to you as
 
00:49:03.549 --> 00:49:03.559 align:start position:0%
anyone I I don't think we have an
 
00:49:06.789 --> 00:49:06.799 align:start position:0%
amendment to 1588 it it seems to me that
 
00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
if we pass it given that this is
 
00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
supposed to go into effect in 60 days we
 
00:49:15.589 --> 00:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
should probably include um an
 
00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
appropriation what I think I've heard in
 
00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:18.990 align:start position:0%
appropriation what I think I've heard in
prior

00:49:18.990 --> 00:49:19.000 align:start position:0%
prior
 
00:49:22.270 --> 00:49:22.280 align:start position:0%
testimony is that in effect the
 
00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:26.480 align:start position:0%
Department's already doing this and and
 
00:49:27.950 --> 00:49:27.960 align:start position:0%
and they're doing it out of their
 
00:49:30.750 --> 00:49:30.760 align:start position:0%
existing budget but I think I've heard a
 
00:49:32.589 --> 00:49:32.599 align:start position:0%
request from the Department to
 
00:49:36.190 --> 00:49:36.200 align:start position:0%
supplement the funds that they've been
 
00:49:39.789 --> 00:49:39.799 align:start position:0%
using does do you we don't have an
 
00:49:41.829 --> 00:49:41.839 align:start position:0%
amendment you don't have an amendment to
 
00:49:43.589 --> 00:49:43.599 align:start position:0%
do that I thought you had an amendment
 
00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
to change the effective date but maybe
 
00:49:48.309 --> 00:49:48.319 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking of another bill no there is
 
00:49:50.069 --> 00:49:50.079 align:start position:0%
a there is there is an amendment
 
00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh 1091 it says the the ACT
 
00:49:55.630 --> 00:49:55.640 align:start position:0%
shall take effect July 1
 
00:49:58.390 --> 00:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
2025 my notes say that regardless of
 
00:50:00.270 --> 00:50:00.280 align:start position:0%
what the amendment says it's being
 
00:50:02.990 --> 00:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
implemented now anyway so we were
 
00:50:06.230 --> 00:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
wondering if that was right I I actually
 
00:50:08.430 --> 00:50:08.440 align:start position:0%
ended up it's got my name on it doesn't
 
00:50:11.150 --> 00:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
it I I think I I withdrew that after we
 
00:50:13.950 --> 00:50:13.960 align:start position:0%
got testimony saying it we could we can
 
00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
say whatever effective date we want but
 
00:50:17.910 --> 00:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
the reality is that the Department's
 
00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:20.480 align:start position:0%
already eaten this because it's in other
 
00:50:21.910 --> 00:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
portions of our
 
00:50:26.109 --> 00:50:26.119 align:start position:0%
law so so I'm thinking we may need a
 
00:50:28.630 --> 00:50:28.640 align:start position:0%
supplement Al
 
00:50:31.710 --> 00:50:31.720 align:start position:0%
appropriation what's your opinion I I
 
00:50:32.670 --> 00:50:32.680 align:start position:0%
would certainly appreciate a
 
00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:34.200 align:start position:0%
supplemental appropriation because we're
 
00:50:36.910 --> 00:50:36.920 align:start position:0%
expanding the eligibility and and the
 
00:50:38.829 --> 00:50:38.839 align:start position:0%
the obligation that that we would have
 
00:50:47.910 --> 00:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
number in the fiscal note again we
 
00:50:54.750 --> 00:50:54.760 align:start position:0%
provided a range right um we we can't
 
00:50:56.990 --> 00:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
predict the future yeah I can't put a
 
00:50:59.670 --> 00:50:59.680 align:start position:0%
range in an appropriation if if we'd
 
00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:25.549 --> 00:51:25.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:25.559 --> 00:51:31.390 align:start position:0%
 
million

00:51:31.390 --> 00:51:31.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:33.430 --> 00:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
yeah I I mean we'd be comfortable with
 
00:51:36.349 --> 00:51:36.359 align:start position:0%
that all right so Mr Ripple could could
 
00:51:39.069 --> 00:51:39.079 align:start position:0%
you work on an amendment it doesn't the
 
00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
amendment would not change the 60 days
 
00:51:43.829 --> 00:51:43.839 align:start position:0%
it would it would but it would put an
 
00:51:46.270 --> 00:51:46.280 align:start position:0%
appropriation in there of 3 million and
 
00:51:49.910 --> 00:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
that would go through the fiscal year
 
00:51:52.030 --> 00:51:52.040 align:start position:0%
yes so for fiscal 25 a $3 million
 
00:51:53.910 --> 00:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
appropriation I again I think I think
 
00:51:55.510 --> 00:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
with OS working on a couple other
 
00:51:58.190 --> 00:51:58.200 align:start position:0%
amendments um it might be unrealistic to
 
00:52:00.109 --> 00:52:00.119 align:start position:0%
expect that back today but I think this
 
00:52:01.589 --> 00:52:01.599 align:start position:0%
amendment would be simple enough that if
 
00:52:03.710 --> 00:52:03.720 align:start position:0%
you wanted to vote on the bill with the
 
00:52:04.829 --> 00:52:04.839 align:start position:0%
understanding that I would produce that
 
00:52:06.630 --> 00:52:06.640 align:start position:0%
Amendment for later you could do that
 
00:52:09.109 --> 00:52:09.119 align:start position:0%
and and then if it's not there then we
 
00:52:11.069 --> 00:52:11.079 align:start position:0%
can clean it up in the full finance
 
00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
committee correct right representative
 
00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:16.030 align:start position:0%
committee correct right representative
wer

00:52:16.030 --> 00:52:16.040 align:start position:0%
wer
 
00:52:19.789 --> 00:52:19.799 align:start position:0%
w i called wer I actually said a right
 
00:52:19.799 --> 00:52:21.710 align:start position:0%
w i called wer I actually said a right
name

00:52:21.710 --> 00:52:21.720 align:start position:0%
name
 
00:52:24.589 --> 00:52:24.599 align:start position:0%
once so these people are supposedly now
 
00:52:27.069 --> 00:52:27.079 align:start position:0%
on special ed
 
00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
funds and likely 80% of that money is is
 
00:52:33.789 --> 00:52:33.799 align:start position:0%
from the state special ed funds rather
 
00:52:35.789 --> 00:52:35.799 align:start position:0%
than local
 
00:52:39.390 --> 00:52:39.400 align:start position:0%
so any idea what the savings would
 
00:52:42.150 --> 00:52:42.160 align:start position:0%
be because the these two programs aren't
 
00:52:44.670 --> 00:52:44.680 align:start position:0%
equal in
 
00:52:47.870 --> 00:52:47.880 align:start position:0%
costs I I'm I'm not understanding the
 
00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
question savings where we'd be expanding
 
00:52:52.549 --> 00:52:52.559 align:start position:0%
the population so next year we would
 
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
have additional costs that we wouldn't
 
00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
have this
 
00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:57.710 align:start position:0%
have this
year

00:52:57.710 --> 00:52:57.720 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:53:04.109 --> 00:53:04.119 align:start position:0%
these these youths are now at at 21 so
 
00:53:07.150 --> 00:53:07.160 align:start position:0%
they changed them at at from 21 to
 
00:53:10.349 --> 00:53:10.359 align:start position:0%
22 the special ed thing took them
 
00:53:14.069 --> 00:53:14.079 align:start position:0%
off after 21 right okay but the court
 
00:53:16.710 --> 00:53:16.720 align:start position:0%
didn't so this is suggesting for the
 
00:53:18.829 --> 00:53:18.839 align:start position:0%
court if I
 
00:53:22.549 --> 00:53:22.559 align:start position:0%
recall okay so hopefully there would be
 
00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
savings projected to what if they but I
 
00:53:26.789 --> 00:53:26.799 align:start position:0%
guess they wouldn't have been paid out a
 
00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
special ed anyway if that all we're
 
00:53:30.910 --> 00:53:30.920 align:start position:0%
doing is aligning the court with what
 
00:53:33.349 --> 00:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
the special ed did so they're not after
 
00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
21 they're not covered by special at
 
00:53:38.630 --> 00:53:38.640 align:start position:0%
anyway so all right so there is no
 
00:53:41.990 --> 00:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
savings thank you worked it out
 
00:53:45.270 --> 00:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
myself representative walner well this
 
00:53:48.910 --> 00:53:48.920 align:start position:0%
is a small piece but when we were here
 
00:53:53.950 --> 00:53:53.960 align:start position:0%
last there was um some testimony that
 
00:53:56.109 --> 00:53:56.119 align:start position:0%
the case management would continue by
 
00:54:02.750 --> 00:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:05.390 --> 00:54:05.400 align:start position:0%
um I'm not that familiar with the
 
00:54:16.150 --> 00:54:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:18.630 --> 00:54:18.640 align:start position:0%
up good afternoon Rebecca Ross the
 
00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
director of The Bureau for children's
 
00:54:21.870 --> 00:54:21.880 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health although the case
 
00:54:23.390 --> 00:54:23.400 align:start position:0%
management would continue from the
 
00:54:26.190 --> 00:54:26.200 align:start position:0%
schools for the purpose of the education
 
00:54:28.270 --> 00:54:28.280 align:start position:0%
um DCF would still be obligated to
 
00:54:30.950 --> 00:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
provide the same level of oversight for
 
00:54:34.750 --> 00:54:34.760 align:start position:0%
the residential and Community parts of
 
00:54:37.549 --> 00:54:37.559 align:start position:0%
the young adults life so dcyf would not
 
00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
have any less obligation for these kids
 
00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
as they do for any other um teenager or
 
00:54:46.910 --> 00:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
young adult that they're serving thank
 
00:54:49.950 --> 00:54:49.960 align:start position:0%
you representative Le on um thank you Mr
 
00:54:51.950 --> 00:54:51.960 align:start position:0%
chairman I'm sorry if this is a dumb
 
00:54:54.349 --> 00:54:54.359 align:start position:0%
question but the people who are
 
00:54:56.710 --> 00:54:56.720 align:start position:0%
addressed by this what is happening
 
00:54:58.670 --> 00:54:58.680 align:start position:0%
right now and who's paying for that
 
00:55:01.710 --> 00:55:01.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:04.390 --> 00:55:04.400 align:start position:0%
bill I think in in some cases it's Case
 
00:55:06.109 --> 00:55:06.119 align:start position:0%
by case but there's a disconnect because
 
00:55:09.789 --> 00:55:09.799 align:start position:0%
the special leg goes through 21 where
 
00:55:12.950 --> 00:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
the residential placement stops at 21
 
00:55:15.309 --> 00:55:15.319 align:start position:0%
and so they're having to find individual
 
00:55:17.470 --> 00:55:17.480 align:start position:0%
plans and transition plans for each
 
00:55:19.309 --> 00:55:19.319 align:start position:0%
youth um which I think we heard the
 
00:55:20.910 --> 00:55:20.920 align:start position:0%
testimony last week that includes some
 
00:55:23.549 --> 00:55:23.559 align:start position:0%
of those cases individuals choosing to
 
00:55:25.510 --> 00:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
end their special education services so
 
00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:28.240 align:start position:0%
they can transition into the adult
 
00:55:30.309 --> 00:55:30.319 align:start position:0%
system I I guess I was just trying to
 
00:55:32.270 --> 00:55:32.280 align:start position:0%
figure out where the money is coming for
 
00:55:33.950 --> 00:55:33.960 align:start position:0%
I I guess we've all trying to figure out
 
00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
where the money's coming from previously
 
00:55:37.069 --> 00:55:37.079 align:start position:0%
with the appropriation but maybe it's
 
00:55:39.029 --> 00:55:39.039 align:start position:0%
more complex I think it's a lot more
 
00:55:41.230 --> 00:55:41.240 align:start position:0%
complicated and individualized and I
 
00:55:43.109 --> 00:55:43.119 align:start position:0%
think that in some cases certain things
 
00:55:44.549 --> 00:55:44.559 align:start position:0%
just aren't happening because there
 
00:55:47.349 --> 00:55:47.359 align:start position:0%
isn't money for them and in other cases
 
00:55:49.390 --> 00:55:49.400 align:start position:0%
individuals that are supporting these
 
00:55:50.990 --> 00:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
Youth and families are being really
 
00:55:52.990 --> 00:55:53.000 align:start position:0%
creative to make sure they can meet most
 
00:55:55.230 --> 00:55:55.240 align:start position:0%
of their needs but there is a
 
00:55:55.240 --> 00:55:56.750 align:start position:0%
of their needs but there is a
disconnect

00:55:56.750 --> 00:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
disconnect
 
00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:00.480 align:start position:0%
Mr White the the 3 million and when I
 
00:56:02.230 --> 00:56:02.240 align:start position:0%
said it I was thinking that's General
 
00:56:13.029 --> 00:56:13.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:16.430 --> 00:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
this this would be 100% General funds
 
00:56:19.109 --> 00:56:19.119 align:start position:0%
100% General funds okay three three
 
00:56:24.109 --> 00:56:24.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:29.430 --> 00:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
comments okay well thank you um
 
00:56:33.270 --> 00:56:33.280 align:start position:0%
so so I would like to have a motion that
 
00:56:36.190 --> 00:56:36.200 align:start position:0%
um on the amendment that I just
 
00:56:39.029 --> 00:56:39.039 align:start position:0%
discussed with Mr Ripple that we would
 
00:56:41.029 --> 00:56:41.039 align:start position:0%
not change the effective date that we
 
00:56:43.069 --> 00:56:43.079 align:start position:0%
would supp add a supplemental
 
00:56:46.109 --> 00:56:46.119 align:start position:0%
appropriation of $3 million for this
 
00:56:49.069 --> 00:56:49.079 align:start position:0%
program and that that money would expire
 
00:56:52.829 --> 00:56:52.839 align:start position:0%
and at the end of this budget cycle I
 
00:56:55.230 --> 00:56:55.240 align:start position:0%
would say it should be
 
00:56:58.870 --> 00:56:58.880 align:start position:0%
non-aps non- lapsing through this budget
 
00:57:00.430 --> 00:57:00.440 align:start position:0%
cycle or through the after the end of
 
00:57:03.069 --> 00:57:03.079 align:start position:0%
the cycle through through the through
 
00:57:06.109 --> 00:57:06.119 align:start position:0%
the budget cycle that we're currently in
 
00:57:09.270 --> 00:57:09.280 align:start position:0%
so it would be it excuse me I meant to
 
00:57:12.829 --> 00:57:12.839 align:start position:0%
say lapsing I said the wrong I I I I got
 
00:57:15.589 --> 00:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
dyslexic I want it I want it to lapse
 
00:57:17.950 --> 00:57:17.960 align:start position:0%
yep so it lapse at the end of the bium
 
00:57:20.510 --> 00:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
yes that's what I meant to say so so
 
00:57:23.349 --> 00:57:23.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for tackling me um I was
 
00:57:24.950 --> 00:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
running in the wrong
 
00:57:26.829 --> 00:57:26.839 align:start position:0%
direction uh
 
00:57:28.789 --> 00:57:28.799 align:start position:0%
representa tki
 
00:57:31.630 --> 00:57:31.640 align:start position:0%
comment I like that idea of a motion and
 
00:57:34.549 --> 00:57:34.559 align:start position:0%
I was going to offer to make the motion
 
00:57:38.750 --> 00:57:38.760 align:start position:0%
so so you'll make a motion I'll second
 
00:57:42.589 --> 00:57:42.599 align:start position:0%
okay so now what we'll do if we accept
 
00:57:45.990 --> 00:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
this on a show of hands what we'll do is
 
00:57:48.630 --> 00:57:48.640 align:start position:0%
Mr Ripple will put it in and we'll
 
00:57:51.349 --> 00:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
verify that the amendment says what we
 
00:57:55.069 --> 00:57:55.079 align:start position:0%
think it says prior to the next finance
 
00:57:56.630 --> 00:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
committee meeting because that's the
 
00:57:58.150 --> 00:57:58.160 align:start position:0%
next time we're scheduled to get
 
00:58:01.589 --> 00:58:01.599 align:start position:0%
together is that acceptable to you Mr
 
00:58:06.589 --> 00:58:06.599 align:start position:0%
chair okay um all right so go you have
 
00:58:09.589 --> 00:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
further discussion uh yes discussion can
 
00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
I ask one more
 
00:58:15.710 --> 00:58:15.720 align:start position:0%
question so what will you be doing with
 
00:58:17.990 --> 00:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
your budget in the next bium as it
 
00:58:21.109 --> 00:58:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:25.549 --> 00:58:25.559 align:start position:0%
this so part of this would depend on the
 
00:58:27.349 --> 00:58:27.359 align:start position:0%
targets that that are set by the
 
00:58:31.430 --> 00:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
governor's office and if the efficiency
 
00:58:35.589 --> 00:58:35.599 align:start position:0%
expenditure Target is set at zero or if
 
00:58:37.990 --> 00:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
we are allowed to include legislative
 
00:58:41.349 --> 00:58:41.359 align:start position:0%
Appropriations from this prior year um
 
00:58:43.510 --> 00:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
then that would ultimately determine how
 
00:58:46.069 --> 00:58:46.079 align:start position:0%
this would come in the next budget but I
 
00:58:48.069 --> 00:58:48.079 align:start position:0%
think there's there's could there's a
 
00:58:49.710 --> 00:58:49.720 align:start position:0%
potential for a strong likelihood that
 
00:58:51.470 --> 00:58:51.480 align:start position:0%
this may come through as a prioritized
 
00:58:54.349 --> 00:58:54.359 align:start position:0%
need um being one of the most recent
 
00:58:57.510 --> 00:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
elements coming in um where we would
 
00:58:59.670 --> 00:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
include everything that's funded to date
 
00:59:02.430 --> 00:59:02.440 align:start position:0%
as an efficiency expenditure um but
 
00:59:03.789 --> 00:59:03.799 align:start position:0%
ultimately this would really depend on
 
00:59:05.670 --> 00:59:05.680 align:start position:0%
what the revenues look like in the next
 
00:59:07.750 --> 00:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
two months uh and the targets that were
 
00:59:12.990 --> 00:59:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:16.270 --> 00:59:16.280 align:start position:0%
office and Mr Ripple is this one of
 
00:59:19.549 --> 00:59:19.559 align:start position:0%
those um phrases where we need to
 
00:59:21.270 --> 00:59:21.280 align:start position:0%
include it in the amendment that the
 
00:59:23.549 --> 00:59:23.559 align:start position:0%
governor's authorized to draw a
 
00:59:25.670 --> 00:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
warrant yeah we we'll include that for
 
00:59:27.870 --> 00:59:27.880 align:start position:0%
any enal fund appropriation okay I
 
00:59:29.630 --> 00:59:29.640 align:start position:0%
wanted to get that out there so that
 
00:59:31.270 --> 00:59:31.280 align:start position:0%
when we see the actual Amendment no
 
00:59:34.230 --> 00:59:34.240 align:start position:0%
one's surprised by that extra
 
00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
Clause Mr representative wer for the
 
00:59:40.670 --> 00:59:40.680 align:start position:0%
future budget we should have some idea
 
00:59:42.870 --> 00:59:42.880 align:start position:0%
because we know the age groups we know
 
00:59:44.190 --> 00:59:44.200 align:start position:0%
the age groups that going to be aging
 
00:59:47.789 --> 00:59:47.799 align:start position:0%
out in the next budget and it we we
 
00:59:49.390 --> 00:59:49.400 align:start position:0%
could take a look at the cases and get
 
00:59:52.109 --> 00:59:52.119 align:start position:0%
some prediction likely to be the same or
 
00:59:54.270 --> 00:59:54.280 align:start position:0%
a little less since most of the as we
 
00:59:57.910 --> 00:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
look at the Agee cohorts in school it
 
01:00:00.510 --> 01:00:00.520 align:start position:0%
seems like every age group going younger
 
01:00:03.630 --> 01:00:03.640 align:start position:0%
gets smaller so there might be some way
 
01:00:05.470 --> 01:00:05.480 align:start position:0%
to predict this for the next budget and
 
01:00:08.309 --> 01:00:08.319 align:start position:0%
we'd be looking for that
 
01:00:10.670 --> 01:00:10.680 align:start position:0%
thanks is there any further discussion
 
01:00:14.390 --> 01:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
on the amendment as we've described it
 
01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
it go ahead represent Stringham yeah I
 
01:00:19.349 --> 01:00:19.359 align:start position:0%
just I just want to say you know we're
 
01:00:20.789 --> 01:00:20.799 align:start position:0%
kind of handcuffed here this is
 
01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:23.880 align:start position:0%
something we've already passed and um
 
01:00:25.349 --> 01:00:25.359 align:start position:0%
you know we're looking at a program that
 
01:00:27.589 --> 01:00:27.599 align:start position:0%
we're talking about $100,000 per
 
01:00:34.349 --> 01:00:34.359 align:start position:0%
recipient per year to be in this and um
 
01:00:36.789 --> 01:00:36.799 align:start position:0%
uh that that we're putting forward it
 
01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
may cost double that it may cost half
 
01:00:42.150 --> 01:00:42.160 align:start position:0%
that but the um
 
01:00:45.630 --> 01:00:45.640 align:start position:0%
um you know I ideally I wish you know
 
01:00:47.630 --> 01:00:47.640 align:start position:0%
that we and finance 3 had had this
 
01:00:49.349 --> 01:00:49.359 align:start position:0%
discussion when the original bill was
 
01:00:51.549 --> 01:00:51.559 align:start position:0%
passed even though I wasn't here then
 
01:00:54.910 --> 01:00:54.920 align:start position:0%
but whoever happened to have my seat so
 
01:00:59.029 --> 01:00:59.039 align:start position:0%
um uh I you know strongly recommend we
 
01:01:00.870 --> 01:01:00.880 align:start position:0%
go forward I strongly think we should
 
01:01:03.270 --> 01:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
put the money money forward to implement
 
01:01:08.990 --> 01:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
what we have um as a as uh our states
 
01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
Representatives have agreed to go
 
01:01:13.069 --> 01:01:13.079 align:start position:0%
forward with
 
01:01:15.150 --> 01:01:15.160 align:start position:0%
but but hopefully we'll have some
 
01:01:17.349 --> 01:01:17.359 align:start position:0%
additional information I don't want to
 
01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
put words in your mouth but it sound
 
01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
like you said you're in favor of the
 
01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:23.640 align:start position:0%
amendment all right
 
01:01:25.910 --> 01:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
um if there is no other discuss
 
01:01:28.390 --> 01:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
discussion uh I'll take a show of hands
 
01:01:30.750 --> 01:01:30.760 align:start position:0%
of those that would be in favor of the
 
01:01:34.309 --> 01:01:34.319 align:start position:0%
amendment as we described to Mr
 
01:01:42.349 --> 01:01:42.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:45.870 --> 01:01:45.880 align:start position:0%
good and then with that I think we're
 
01:01:48.829 --> 01:01:48.839 align:start position:0%
ready for another motion that's OT
 
01:01:51.150 --> 01:01:51.160 align:start position:0%

01:01:55.230 --> 01:01:55.240 align:start position:0%

on this I I don't know wor I don't know
 
01:03:23.029 --> 01:03:23.039 align:start position:0%
um you you got time if you want to write
 
01:03:25.150 --> 01:03:25.160 align:start position:0%
an amendment representative Earth just
 
01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:26.480 align:start position:0%
said he's not
 
01:03:28.990 --> 01:03:29.000 align:start position:0%
okay or not an amendment but a blur blur
 
01:03:32.349 --> 01:03:32.359 align:start position:0%
yeah no I understand um I just I'm
 
01:03:36.190 --> 01:03:36.200 align:start position:0%
looking at the the lb's status of where
 
01:03:40.309 --> 01:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
we are financially at this point and um
 
01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to figure out where
 
01:03:43.150 --> 01:03:43.160 align:start position:0%
which bucket the money is coming from
 
01:03:44.549 --> 01:03:44.559 align:start position:0%
because it's not real clear at this
 
01:03:46.950 --> 01:03:46.960 align:start position:0%
point yes sir and and one of the things
 
01:03:49.910 --> 01:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if you were here or uh I
 
01:03:51.870 --> 01:03:51.880 align:start position:0%
just didn't leave a a mark when I said
 
01:03:56.309 --> 01:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
it I I had asked at the outset of the
 
01:04:01.470 --> 01:04:01.480 align:start position:0%
hearings if division 3 had basically a a
 
01:04:03.190 --> 01:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
budget or a ceiling that we should be
 
01:04:05.990 --> 01:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
working within and the guidance I
 
01:04:10.190 --> 01:04:10.200 align:start position:0%
received was uh my takeaway was let's go
 
01:04:12.829 --> 01:04:12.839 align:start position:0%
through these bills do each one the
 
01:04:16.190 --> 01:04:16.200 align:start position:0%
right way and then at the end of it
 
01:04:18.470 --> 01:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
we'll pass the the recommendation to the
 
01:04:20.549 --> 01:04:20.559 align:start position:0%
full finance committee and and we'll
 
01:04:23.029 --> 01:04:23.039 align:start position:0%
have a better visibility on on the
 
01:04:25.390 --> 01:04:25.400 align:start position:0%
availability of funds so when we get
 
01:04:28.029 --> 01:04:28.039 align:start position:0%
when we get to the exact session we will
 
01:04:30.470 --> 01:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
probably have some some figures from LBA
 
01:04:33.430 --> 01:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
of what we've proposed and how much is
 
01:04:35.910 --> 01:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
there including the education trust fund
 
01:04:38.549 --> 01:04:38.559 align:start position:0%
the finance exact session yes yes sir
 
01:04:40.870 --> 01:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
and and and just so division three knows
 
01:04:43.309 --> 01:04:43.319 align:start position:0%
I I I hear that we we do have a big
 
01:04:47.309 --> 01:04:47.319 align:start position:0%
spend in the education area that we're
 
01:04:49.750 --> 01:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
anticipating I don't think so but but
 
01:04:52.670 --> 01:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
there's 53 million over in division one
 
01:04:58.150 --> 01:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
on that um r of of the from two% to 2
 
01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:00.640 align:start position:0%
and a half% with group two
 
01:05:03.069 --> 01:05:03.079 align:start position:0%
retirements okay that's going to be the
 
01:05:03.079 --> 01:05:04.029 align:start position:0%
retirements okay that's going to be the
biggest

01:05:04.029 --> 01:05:04.039 align:start position:0%
biggest
 
01:05:07.069 --> 01:05:07.079 align:start position:0%
chunk represent a whole thank you a
 
01:05:09.349 --> 01:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
question for um ultimately I think the
 
01:05:12.309 --> 01:05:12.319 align:start position:0%
LBA is a whole can we get from you guys
 
01:05:15.430 --> 01:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
an updated estimate by division of what
 
01:05:19.710 --> 01:05:19.720 align:start position:0%
has been positively announced or agreed
 
01:05:21.710 --> 01:05:21.720 align:start position:0%
to so far as recommendations and where
 
01:05:24.510 --> 01:05:24.520 align:start position:0%
that puts us financially in terms of
 
01:05:26.750 --> 01:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
Appropriations only yes yeah we can do
 
01:05:29.990 --> 01:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
that thank you happened I saw something
 
01:05:32.029 --> 01:05:32.039 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:05:34.510 --> 01:05:34.520 align:start position:0%
um is there anyone that wants to write
 
01:05:40.069 --> 01:05:40.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
1588 1588 in
 
01:05:45.549 --> 01:05:45.559 align:start position:0%
affirmative you you made the motion
 
01:05:47.910 --> 01:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham who who did
 
01:05:53.870 --> 01:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:56.670 --> 01:05:56.680 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
01:06:01.109 --> 01:06:01.119 align:start position:0%
um let's go to House Bill
 
01:06:04.150 --> 01:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
1669 I understand representative hle has
 
01:06:07.349 --> 01:06:07.359 align:start position:0%
an an amendment for us to
 
01:06:11.910 --> 01:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:13.510 align:start position:0%
 
out

01:06:13.510 --> 01:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
um so during our discussion there was
 
01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
the desire to make this um a
 
01:06:23.630 --> 01:06:23.640 align:start position:0%
precautionary statement right prior to
 
01:06:25.269 --> 01:06:25.279 align:start position:0%
entering into any relationship the
 
01:06:28.269 --> 01:06:28.279 align:start position:0%
following shall be done but DHHS also
 
01:06:30.029 --> 01:06:30.039 align:start position:0%
asked that they could get started on the
 
01:06:32.309 --> 01:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
process to make this happen we had a
 
01:06:35.150 --> 01:06:35.160 align:start position:0%
discussion about that and we needed to
 
01:06:39.710 --> 01:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
allocate funds and a position to do that
 
01:06:42.630 --> 01:06:42.640 align:start position:0%
um and this amendment does exactly that
 
01:06:45.549 --> 01:06:45.559 align:start position:0%
this amendment authorizes a new position
 
01:06:48.269 --> 01:06:48.279 align:start position:0%
and um allocates the funds necessary to
 
01:06:50.269 --> 01:06:50.279 align:start position:0%
start the process to make sure that the
 
01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:54.520 align:start position:0%
data um is Dean or
 
01:06:56.910 --> 01:06:56.920 align:start position:0%
anonymized so so I'm going to I'm going
 
01:06:59.190 --> 01:06:59.200 align:start position:0%
to ask us to spend the next minute
 
01:07:01.190 --> 01:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
reading this and thinking about it and
 
01:07:03.470 --> 01:07:03.480 align:start position:0%
then I'm going to go to representative
 
01:07:07.109 --> 01:07:07.119 align:start position:0%
uh Leon who has been working this bill
 
01:07:24.510 --> 01:07:24.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:54.430 align:start position:0%
 
think

01:07:54.430 --> 01:07:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:54.440 --> 01:08:16.749 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:08:16.749 --> 01:08:16.759 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:18.510 --> 01:08:18.520 align:start position:0%
it it looks like everyone's right I
 
01:08:21.789 --> 01:08:21.799 align:start position:0%
don't see any more lips moving
 
01:08:24.910 --> 01:08:24.920 align:start position:0%
so so representative Leon what do you
 
01:08:27.070 --> 01:08:27.080 align:start position:0%
think of this Amendment uh thank you Mr
 
01:08:29.630 --> 01:08:29.640 align:start position:0%
chairman um I I like this amendment I
 
01:08:31.309 --> 01:08:31.319 align:start position:0%
guess this is s of part of the problem
 
01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
of people that are not in finance
 
01:08:35.149 --> 01:08:35.159 align:start position:0%
writing bills and not realizing what the
 
01:08:37.990 --> 01:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
consequences will be about um just
 
01:08:40.470 --> 01:08:40.480 align:start position:0%
everything that we Implement uh the fact
 
01:08:42.390 --> 01:08:42.400 align:start position:0%
that we have withdrawals from the
 
01:08:45.390 --> 01:08:45.400 align:start position:0%
immunization information system is very
 
01:08:47.269 --> 01:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
important and our state government
 
01:08:49.229 --> 01:08:49.239 align:start position:0%
should be following all of our state
 
01:08:52.269 --> 01:08:52.279 align:start position:0%
laws as they interact with other states
 
01:08:54.829 --> 01:08:54.839 align:start position:0%
um the fact that this now allows us to
 
01:08:57.030 --> 01:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
provide a position that's necessary in
 
01:08:59.070 --> 01:08:59.080 align:start position:0%
order to stay consistent with all of our
 
01:09:02.030 --> 01:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
state laws is quite important as is
 
01:09:04.110 --> 01:09:04.120 align:start position:0%
appropriating that uh money for the
 
01:09:07.749 --> 01:09:07.759 align:start position:0%
position and also for the it updates um
 
01:09:09.709 --> 01:09:09.719 align:start position:0%
this is something that also is in the
 
01:09:11.550 --> 01:09:11.560 align:start position:0%
process of going through and rulemaking
 
01:09:13.189 --> 01:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
which makes this very important to make
 
01:09:15.269 --> 01:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
sure that we have the position that will
 
01:09:17.829 --> 01:09:17.839 align:start position:0%
allow the department to actually go
 
01:09:19.789 --> 01:09:19.799 align:start position:0%
ahead and Implement what is already in
 
01:09:21.870 --> 01:09:21.880 align:start position:0%
law and what is going in in rules as
 
01:09:25.510 --> 01:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
well so this is um one of those great
 
01:09:26.749 --> 01:09:26.759 align:start position:0%
opportunities to make sure that we're
 
01:09:28.309 --> 01:09:28.319 align:start position:0%
actually going to continue to do what
 
01:09:30.789 --> 01:09:30.799 align:start position:0%
our laws and rules say that we do and to
 
01:09:33.229 --> 01:09:33.239 align:start position:0%
appropriate the funds um appropriately
 
01:09:34.709 --> 01:09:34.719 align:start position:0%
and just going back to this whole
 
01:09:36.749 --> 01:09:36.759 align:start position:0%
process with the IIs you know the
 
01:09:38.510 --> 01:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
department did an amazing job getting
 
01:09:41.430 --> 01:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
this up and running during covid um that
 
01:09:43.669 --> 01:09:43.679 align:start position:0%
was a herculan job herculan task and
 
01:09:45.189 --> 01:09:45.199 align:start position:0%
they did a great job making sure that it
 
01:09:46.829 --> 01:09:46.839 align:start position:0%
was implemented so we could get all of
 
01:09:48.829 --> 01:09:48.839 align:start position:0%
the vaccines that we needed to get um
 
01:09:51.709 --> 01:09:51.719 align:start position:0%
when the state administered them so
 
01:09:55.110 --> 01:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
thank you I I I have a fact question for
 
01:09:56.870 --> 01:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
um Mr White and then I'll come to you
 
01:09:59.590 --> 01:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
representative walner uh do you have a
 
01:10:03.070 --> 01:10:03.080 align:start position:0%
copy of the amendment okay um I I just
 
01:10:06.270 --> 01:10:06.280 align:start position:0%
need a an education and state Personnel
 
01:10:07.990 --> 01:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
101 uh
 
01:10:11.470 --> 01:10:11.480 align:start position:0%
lines 12 through
 
01:10:14.669 --> 01:10:14.679 align:start position:0%
15 uh lays out the scope of
 
01:10:17.750 --> 01:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
responsibilities for this new position
 
01:10:22.270 --> 01:10:22.280 align:start position:0%
what I'm concerned about is um I I I I
 
01:10:24.550 --> 01:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
don't want to create a situation where
 
01:10:26.070 --> 01:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
this person
 
01:10:28.590 --> 01:10:28.600 align:start position:0%
only does what's in the scope of what's
 
01:10:32.189 --> 01:10:32.199 align:start position:0%
written here and if time was available
 
01:10:34.750 --> 01:10:34.760 align:start position:0%
would not believe that they needed to do
 
01:10:39.590 --> 01:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
other tasks as assigned so is this is
 
01:10:43.669 --> 01:10:43.679 align:start position:0%
this a a hard limitation on the scope of
 
01:10:46.270 --> 01:10:46.280 align:start position:0%
duties or is this just sort of the
 
01:10:50.189 --> 01:10:50.199 align:start position:0%
initial um uh job description kind of
 
01:10:52.390 --> 01:10:52.400 align:start position:0%
thing but they would still be expected
 
01:10:56.590 --> 01:10:56.600 align:start position:0%
to do more as time is available
 
01:11:01.350 --> 01:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
so a in in every probably almost every
 
01:11:03.590 --> 01:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
sjd that I've seen there are
 
01:11:04.910 --> 01:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
accountabilities and one of the
 
01:11:06.750 --> 01:11:06.760 align:start position:0%
accountabilities at the bottom and other
 
01:11:10.590 --> 01:11:10.600 align:start position:0%
tasks as a sign B I wouldn't necessarily
 
01:11:12.070 --> 01:11:12.080 align:start position:0%
interpret this language to be
 
01:11:14.030 --> 01:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
restrictive that this is the only thing
 
01:11:16.550 --> 01:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
that they could work on so I would not
 
01:11:18.430 --> 01:11:18.440 align:start position:0%
anticipate that typically you would only
 
01:11:22.030 --> 01:11:22.040 align:start position:0%
see that with very finite federal grants
 
01:11:25.390 --> 01:11:25.400 align:start position:0%
that have very specific requirements um
 
01:11:27.310 --> 01:11:27.320 align:start position:0%
I I will let the expert here though
 
01:11:28.950 --> 01:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
speak to the other duties that the
 
01:11:31.910 --> 01:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
position would perform hello um in Mary
 
01:11:33.709 --> 01:11:33.719 align:start position:0%
mcer from the immunization section thank
 
01:11:36.830 --> 01:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
you very much um for your question what
 
01:11:38.629 --> 01:11:38.639 align:start position:0%
we would do is essentially we have
 
01:11:41.270 --> 01:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
similar types of positions so we would
 
01:11:43.750 --> 01:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
look at the the uh degree and the amount
 
01:11:46.070 --> 01:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
of effort that was put towards this
 
01:11:48.070 --> 01:11:48.080 align:start position:0%
particular initiative and it's most
 
01:11:49.870 --> 01:11:49.880 align:start position:0%
likely that we would have an individual
 
01:11:52.950 --> 01:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
time allocated um so that if these funds
 
01:11:55.390 --> 01:11:55.400 align:start position:0%
these State Appropriations were made um
 
01:11:56.790 --> 01:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
um we would make sure that there would
 
01:11:59.110 --> 01:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
be some accounting and adjustment of you
 
01:12:01.229 --> 01:12:01.239 align:start position:0%
know how much level of effort was needed
 
01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
for this particular initiative um
 
01:12:06.270 --> 01:12:06.280 align:start position:0%
currently you know we do have uh quite a
 
01:12:07.910 --> 01:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
bit of withdrawals that are coming into
 
01:12:09.950 --> 01:12:09.960 align:start position:0%
the department so at this point in time
 
01:12:12.070 --> 01:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
it would be a big gu but we don't know
 
01:12:13.910 --> 01:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
what the withdrawal numbers would be in
 
01:12:16.950 --> 01:12:16.960 align:start position:0%
the future or once this effort was um in
 
01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
play and really streamlined we want to
 
01:12:21.950 --> 01:12:21.960 align:start position:0%
make sure that we have that ability to
 
01:12:25.229 --> 01:12:25.239 align:start position:0%
um you know properly fund this position
 
01:12:27.229 --> 01:12:27.239 align:start position:0%
with the appropriate dollars um
 
01:12:29.270 --> 01:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
depending on what the accountability of
 
01:12:32.310 --> 01:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
this Duty would be Eads that sounds far
 
01:12:34.430 --> 01:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
more complex than what I was hoping the
 
01:12:37.070 --> 01:12:37.080 align:start position:0%
reality would be I I what I was hoping
 
01:12:38.870 --> 01:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
is that we'd give you some money for the
 
01:12:41.470 --> 01:12:41.480 align:start position:0%
position that you'd go fill the position
 
01:12:43.750 --> 01:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
and then at that point we we didn't
 
01:12:45.830 --> 01:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
create a big bookkeeping thing where you
 
01:12:48.270 --> 01:12:48.280 align:start position:0%
had to make sure that there was an audit
 
01:12:51.149 --> 01:12:51.159 align:start position:0%
Trail between that money in that person
 
01:12:53.110 --> 01:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
are you telling me there really is that
 
01:12:55.709 --> 01:12:55.719 align:start position:0%
level of a a bookkeeping re ired to
 
01:12:58.950 --> 01:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
maintain that kind of an audit Trail um
 
01:13:02.590 --> 01:13:02.600 align:start position:0%
most likely yes because um when we do
 
01:13:05.070 --> 01:13:05.080 align:start position:0%
look at the level of effort from
 
01:13:07.310 --> 01:13:07.320 align:start position:0%
positions we do tend to do some time
 
01:13:11.350 --> 01:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
source so you know I like efficiency if
 
01:13:17.149 --> 01:13:17.159 align:start position:0%
you could tell me something about how we
 
01:13:19.350 --> 01:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
do this in an efficient way Mr White
 
01:13:22.550 --> 01:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:25.950 --> 01:13:25.960 align:start position:0%
great I I I I believe the the the
 
01:13:27.430 --> 01:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
question that you were trying to get at
 
01:13:29.430 --> 01:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
is is this person going to sit around
 
01:13:31.149 --> 01:13:31.159 align:start position:0%
and do nothing if all of these Duties
 
01:13:33.950 --> 01:13:33.960 align:start position:0%
are assigned and the answer would be no
 
01:13:34.870 --> 01:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if you can give
 
01:13:36.709 --> 01:13:36.719 align:start position:0%
examples of like the other type of
 
01:13:39.310 --> 01:13:39.320 align:start position:0%
functions they may
 
01:13:42.510 --> 01:13:42.520 align:start position:0%
perform sure so we have approximately uh
 
01:13:45.950 --> 01:13:45.960 align:start position:0%
450 providers that actually use the nhas
 
01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:48.400 align:start position:0%
system I I think I'm going to accept no
 
01:13:49.910 --> 01:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank and and then because we we
 
01:13:52.270 --> 01:13:52.280 align:start position:0%
got to get out of here so so thank you
 
01:13:54.470 --> 01:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
very much representative Wen did you
 
01:13:55.790 --> 01:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
01:14:00.070 --> 01:14:00.080 align:start position:0%
did it's really for Mr White if um so
 
01:14:03.629 --> 01:14:03.639 align:start position:0%
there is um in the amendment
 
01:14:06.870 --> 01:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
$80,000 for the uh onetime enhancement
 
01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
to the New Hampshire immunization
 
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
information system and when I go to my
 
01:14:15.390 --> 01:14:15.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal note which I have do have a note
 
01:14:18.270 --> 01:14:18.280 align:start position:0%
here at one point we were anticipating a
 
01:14:21.229 --> 01:14:21.239 align:start position:0%
$3 million cost that's an
 
01:14:23.990 --> 01:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
incredible an incredible amount of
 
01:14:31.550 --> 01:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:34.669 --> 01:14:34.679 align:start position:0%
80 do do you have an answer to that this
 
01:14:37.510 --> 01:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
this is a weers number though isn't it I
 
01:14:39.669 --> 01:14:39.679 align:start position:0%
I I believe there were changes via an
 
01:14:41.229 --> 01:14:41.239 align:start position:0%
amendment and I believe representative
 
01:14:43.110 --> 01:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
Lon was going to speak to that
 
01:14:44.830 --> 01:14:44.840 align:start position:0%
representative Leon uh thank you there
 
01:14:46.629 --> 01:14:46.639 align:start position:0%
was a whole another task that had been
 
01:14:48.510 --> 01:14:48.520 align:start position:0%
in the bill initially um but that was
 
01:14:50.629 --> 01:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
amended out in Health and Human Services
 
01:14:52.229 --> 01:14:52.239 align:start position:0%
I believe there's an updated Financial
 
01:14:54.070 --> 01:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
note um it's we just don't have the
 
01:14:55.790 --> 01:14:55.800 align:start position:0%
printed out copy with with us but this
 
01:14:58.229 --> 01:14:58.239 align:start position:0%
88 80,000 I believe is consistent with
 
01:15:02.229 --> 01:15:02.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:05.590 --> 01:15:05.600 align:start position:0%

1183
 
01:19:05.709 --> 01:19:05.719 align:start position:0%
H um which would
 
01:19:08.790 --> 01:19:08.800 align:start position:0%
have really actually done two things it
 
01:19:11.550 --> 01:19:11.560 align:start position:0%
would have provided um the department
 
01:19:13.390 --> 01:19:13.400 align:start position:0%
with a
 
01:19:17.750 --> 01:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
position and it would have provided um a
 
01:19:20.070 --> 01:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
consultant to work with the Department
 
01:19:23.750 --> 01:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
around the preparation of a report and
 
01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:25.270 align:start position:0%
around the preparation of a report and
um

01:19:25.270 --> 01:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:27.189 --> 01:19:27.199 align:start position:0%
information on how to implement and
 
01:19:30.310 --> 01:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
manage the Social Security
 
01:19:35.950 --> 01:19:35.960 align:start position:0%
payments there seem to have been um some
 
01:19:41.070 --> 01:19:41.080 align:start position:0%
questions about the um position so what
 
01:19:43.350 --> 01:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
I am bringing forth today is an
 
01:19:45.950 --> 01:19:45.960 align:start position:0%
amendment I do have others that you can
 
01:19:48.470 --> 01:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
choose from too but this is the one I'm
 
01:19:50.990 --> 01:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
going to bring forth
 
01:19:54.149 --> 01:19:54.159 align:start position:0%
first this what this position what this
 
01:19:58.550 --> 01:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
uh Amendment does is um just provide for
 
01:20:01.470 --> 01:20:01.480 align:start position:0%
a consultant that would work with the
 
01:20:06.030 --> 01:20:06.040 align:start position:0%
Department um around um the uh
 
01:20:08.350 --> 01:20:08.360 align:start position:0%
management of the Social Security
 
01:20:12.669 --> 01:20:12.679 align:start position:0%
payments and the implementation of um
 
01:20:16.790 --> 01:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
these this program and um the report
 
01:20:19.310 --> 01:20:19.320 align:start position:0%
would be due by December
 
01:20:23.669 --> 01:20:23.679 align:start position:0%
31st so yes it would not be available
 
01:20:26.110 --> 01:20:26.120 align:start position:0%
for inclusion
 
01:20:29.430 --> 01:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
in the a Governor's budget proposal but
 
01:20:32.229 --> 01:20:32.239 align:start position:0%
it would be available to the house when
 
01:20:35.030 --> 01:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
the budget came to us to take a look at
 
01:20:40.229 --> 01:20:40.239 align:start position:0%
it um at that point and um I did put
 
01:20:44.229 --> 01:20:44.239 align:start position:0%
that the um consultant that was hired
 
01:20:47.350 --> 01:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
would need to be knowledgeable in um the
 
01:20:49.830 --> 01:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
efforts that are taking place in other
 
01:20:52.709 --> 01:20:52.719 align:start position:0%
states and there are a number of states
 
01:20:55.470 --> 01:20:55.480 align:start position:0%
who are moving forward with this
 
01:20:55.480 --> 01:20:56.629 align:start position:0%
who are moving forward with this
um

01:20:56.629 --> 01:20:56.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:58.990 --> 01:20:59.000 align:start position:0%
proposal so I'll come to you in just a
 
01:21:01.750 --> 01:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
second I I I I I think it's I think it's
 
01:21:04.629 --> 01:21:04.639 align:start position:0%
fair to uh point out that representative
 
01:21:06.950 --> 01:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
wer and I I talked about this the other
 
01:21:10.390 --> 01:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
day and and this is this is an approach
 
01:21:13.270 --> 01:21:13.280 align:start position:0%
that uh she and I uh agreed to
 
01:21:14.950 --> 01:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
tentatively I wanted to see what the
 
01:21:16.950 --> 01:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
amendment said actually How It Was
 
01:21:21.910 --> 01:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
Written um but I I um my my my thought
 
01:21:25.750 --> 01:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
on this was that um we had such
 
01:21:28.189 --> 01:21:28.199 align:start position:0%
diametrically opposed points of views on
 
01:21:31.270 --> 01:21:31.280 align:start position:0%
this bill that this was really an a
 
01:21:34.110 --> 01:21:34.120 align:start position:0%
relatively simple no new Manpower kind
 
01:21:36.750 --> 01:21:36.760 align:start position:0%
of program to implement to the
 
01:21:38.750 --> 01:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
department I think saying something that
 
01:21:41.030 --> 01:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
they wanted on the order of magnitude to
 
01:21:43.709 --> 01:21:43.719 align:start position:0%
about 10 people and there was a lot of
 
01:21:46.110 --> 01:21:46.120 align:start position:0%
you know liability that was associated
 
01:21:49.149 --> 01:21:49.159 align:start position:0%
with this maybe that was my paranoia but
 
01:21:52.189 --> 01:21:52.199 align:start position:0%
um but in any case with such a
 
01:21:56.189 --> 01:21:56.199 align:start position:0%
diametrically opposed uh set of
 
01:21:59.110 --> 01:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
viewpoints um the obvious thing for the
 
01:22:01.669 --> 01:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
legislature to do in that situation
 
01:22:04.430 --> 01:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
would be direct interim study and I I
 
01:22:06.910 --> 01:22:06.920 align:start position:0%
didn't want to just direct interim study
 
01:22:10.590 --> 01:22:10.600 align:start position:0%
I I wanted this fully vetted and and so
 
01:22:12.790 --> 01:22:12.800 align:start position:0%
that's that's that's why I was happy to
 
01:22:14.350 --> 01:22:14.360 align:start position:0%
agree with representative walner that we
 
01:22:16.830 --> 01:22:16.840 align:start position:0%
should go get a consultant but not just
 
01:22:18.629 --> 01:22:18.639 align:start position:0%
any consultant we wanted to get a
 
01:22:20.750 --> 01:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
consultant who actually could tell us
 
01:22:22.669 --> 01:22:22.679 align:start position:0%
something we didn't already know that's
 
01:22:27.510 --> 01:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
why that last sentence on 13 through 15
 
01:22:31.189 --> 01:22:31.199 align:start position:0%
in the first section is important so um
 
01:22:32.830 --> 01:22:32.840 align:start position:0%
so that that's what I have to say about
 
01:22:34.430 --> 01:22:34.440 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
01:22:37.669 --> 01:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
hle thank you Mr chair so the member
 
01:22:40.550 --> 01:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
from conquer right if I recall and I
 
01:22:43.310 --> 01:22:43.320 align:start position:0%
spoke afterward and I'm in agreement
 
01:22:46.270 --> 01:22:46.280 align:start position:0%
with the concept of trying to get the
 
01:22:48.990 --> 01:22:49.000 align:start position:0%
information we need we need to make an
 
01:22:50.990 --> 01:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
informed decision
 
01:22:54.030 --> 01:22:54.040 align:start position:0%
um my only concern and I expressed this
 
01:22:57.510 --> 01:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
earlier privately was $200,000 is a lot
 
01:22:59.750 --> 01:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
for a 9month contract this is going to
 
01:23:02.590 --> 01:23:02.600 align:start position:0%
be done by the end of the year I've been
 
01:23:04.550 --> 01:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
in a Consulting business for quite some
 
01:23:07.350 --> 01:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
time um you could hire a very competent
 
01:23:10.709 --> 01:23:10.719 align:start position:0%
person for a very long time at that rate
 
01:23:12.870 --> 01:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
I'm okay with this idea I think the
 
01:23:14.430 --> 01:23:14.440 align:start position:0%
number is higher than we would I would
 
01:23:15.990 --> 01:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
love to see that number reduced to
 
01:23:19.229 --> 01:23:19.239 align:start position:0%
$100,000 I think finding somebody for
 
01:23:21.390 --> 01:23:21.400 align:start position:0%
$100,000 to get a report by the end of
 
01:23:24.709 --> 01:23:24.719 align:start position:0%
the year is very reasonable consider ing
 
01:23:27.950 --> 01:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:33.390 --> 01:23:33.400 align:start position:0%
do represent walner so I uh the $200,000
 
01:23:35.229 --> 01:23:35.239 align:start position:0%
wasn't something that I personally
 
01:23:39.870 --> 01:23:39.880 align:start position:0%
thought up it was um from an amendment
 
01:23:42.470 --> 01:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
that the department had provided to me
 
01:23:44.430 --> 01:23:44.440 align:start position:0%
as a suggestion for how to move forward
 
01:23:47.229 --> 01:23:47.239 align:start position:0%
on this bill so the $200,000 was
 
01:23:49.070 --> 01:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
something the department did suggest to
 
01:23:53.510 --> 01:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
me so they might be able to tell you um
 
01:23:56.390 --> 01:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
why that number was was picked and um
 
01:23:58.550 --> 01:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
whether they think they could actually
 
01:24:01.870 --> 01:24:01.880 align:start position:0%
find someone to do this kind of work at
 
01:24:04.229 --> 01:24:04.239 align:start position:0%
a lesser
 
01:24:06.229 --> 01:24:06.239 align:start position:0%
amount is it possible we ask the
 
01:24:09.709 --> 01:24:09.719 align:start position:0%
department for that I just at a at a
 
01:24:13.390 --> 01:24:13.400 align:start position:0%
$200 an hour that's still a th000 hours
 
01:24:16.070 --> 01:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
it's a lot right and a $200 an hour
 
01:24:18.790 --> 01:24:18.800 align:start position:0%
consultant is a highly paid consultant
 
01:24:21.270 --> 01:24:21.280 align:start position:0%
um I know of Professional Engineers and
 
01:24:23.310 --> 01:24:23.320 align:start position:0%
others who aren't making quite that much
 
01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:24.830 align:start position:0%
others who aren't making quite that much
so

01:24:24.830 --> 01:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:24:26.830 --> 01:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
I think there's there's not even 2,000
 
01:24:29.030 --> 01:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
hours worth of time between now and
 
01:24:31.350 --> 01:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
December at any reasonable level I I do
 
01:24:33.590 --> 01:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
think this can be done for Less I think
 
01:24:35.550 --> 01:24:35.560 align:start position:0%
we should ask the department to see to
 
01:24:37.189 --> 01:24:37.199 align:start position:0%
figure out how to do that for less and
 
01:24:38.870 --> 01:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
if we make that the amendment I will
 
01:24:41.750 --> 01:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
gladly put my name on this at at the
 
01:24:45.629 --> 01:24:45.639 align:start position:0%
lower dollar value I I'm not arguing the
 
01:24:49.070 --> 01:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
dollar value I'm I'm arguing um the the
 
01:24:51.750 --> 01:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
content of what the 200,000 may may end
 
01:24:54.550 --> 01:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
up buying because we want somebody who
 
01:24:56.149 --> 01:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
actually knows something about other
 
01:24:58.189 --> 01:24:58.199 align:start position:0%
states it could be somebody who lives in
 
01:25:00.870 --> 01:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
another state and has Transportation
 
01:25:03.510 --> 01:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
costs and has to stay here to interview
 
01:25:07.709 --> 01:25:07.719 align:start position:0%
people here no so Mr White do you want
 
01:25:15.430 --> 01:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:21.470 --> 01:25:21.480 align:start position:0%
200,000 sure um it is not very well let
 
01:25:23.750 --> 01:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
me back up I think one important thing
 
01:25:25.510 --> 01:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
is we're not just is paying for report
 
01:25:28.350 --> 01:25:28.360 align:start position:0%
we'd also be paying to have technical
 
01:25:30.550 --> 01:25:30.560 align:start position:0%
assistance come during the house phase
 
01:25:32.430 --> 01:25:32.440 align:start position:0%
potentially during the Senate phase and
 
01:25:34.550 --> 01:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
after so the terms of the contract the
 
01:25:35.950 --> 01:25:35.960 align:start position:0%
contract wouldn't just end on December
 
01:25:38.950 --> 01:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
31st we'd likely want the report and
 
01:25:40.990 --> 01:25:41.000 align:start position:0%
then it be have the opportunity for
 
01:25:43.030 --> 01:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
follow-up work during the budget process
 
01:25:44.950 --> 01:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
because I'm assuming the report would
 
01:25:46.709 --> 01:25:46.719 align:start position:0%
only elicit more questions which may
 
01:25:49.550 --> 01:25:49.560 align:start position:0%
elicit more questions um so when we were
 
01:25:51.950 --> 01:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
thinking about this we were looking at
 
01:25:54.750 --> 01:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
some of the uh hourly rates that we do
 
01:25:57.830 --> 01:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
pay uh some of the technical providers
 
01:26:00.070 --> 01:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
um or or Consultants that that we have
 
01:26:02.430 --> 01:26:02.440 align:start position:0%
which are sometimes in excess of 100
 
01:26:04.870 --> 01:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
$200 $300 depending upon the nature and
 
01:26:07.750 --> 01:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
service of the work um ultimately this
 
01:26:09.709 --> 01:26:09.719 align:start position:0%
would be a soul Source contract so we
 
01:26:11.910 --> 01:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
would not be following this to in order
 
01:26:14.390 --> 01:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
to reach the deadline so we would not be
 
01:26:16.310 --> 01:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
going through a competitive bid process
 
01:26:17.950 --> 01:26:17.960 align:start position:0%
through those negotiations we could
 
01:26:20.310 --> 01:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
potentially get that down again this is
 
01:26:22.950 --> 01:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
our best guest ballp perk conservative
 
01:26:25.030 --> 01:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
we're always going to be you know more
 
01:26:26.590 --> 01:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
on the conservative side because I don't
 
01:26:31.550 --> 01:26:31.560 align:start position:0%
want to run out of money um but if if if
 
01:26:33.629 --> 01:26:33.639 align:start position:0%
if if there's some reduction to that we
 
01:26:35.390 --> 01:26:35.400 align:start position:0%
can try to do the best job that we can
 
01:26:37.669 --> 01:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
to make it work um but this was a
 
01:26:39.350 --> 01:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
solution that we had proposed to try to
 
01:26:42.189 --> 01:26:42.199 align:start position:0%
find some path forward so so two points
 
01:26:45.229 --> 01:26:45.239 align:start position:0%
so do do we need uh simple one do we
 
01:26:47.950 --> 01:26:47.960 align:start position:0%
need to write not to exceed 200,000 or
 
01:26:50.709 --> 01:26:50.719 align:start position:0%
is it not to exceed understood that's
 
01:26:52.590 --> 01:26:52.600 align:start position:0%
implicit in the authority okay and then
 
01:26:56.189 --> 01:26:56.199 align:start position:0%
the second one uh is uh I liked what you
 
01:26:59.070 --> 01:26:59.080 align:start position:0%
said about having this individual around
 
01:27:01.189 --> 01:27:01.199 align:start position:0%
to help us with any potential
 
01:27:04.669 --> 01:27:04.679 align:start position:0%
implementation I I like hearing that but
 
01:27:07.149 --> 01:27:07.159 align:start position:0%
I'm not seeing it in the write up I'm
 
01:27:10.950 --> 01:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
seeing that the report shall have the
 
01:27:15.990 --> 01:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
purposes of blah blah blah around 11 and
 
01:27:20.109 --> 01:27:20.119 align:start position:0%
12 um somewhere in there I I I I read
 
01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
that the report would have some
 
01:27:25.149 --> 01:27:25.159 align:start position:0%
implementation guidance I'm not reading
 
01:27:27.030 --> 01:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
that the consultant would have
 
01:27:29.229 --> 01:27:29.239 align:start position:0%
implementation responsibilities is is
 
01:27:31.310 --> 01:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
this wording accurate um I mean we could
 
01:27:32.950 --> 01:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
have a simple sentence saying the
 
01:27:35.229 --> 01:27:35.239 align:start position:0%
consultant shall provide technical
 
01:27:37.030 --> 01:27:37.040 align:start position:0%
support throughout the ter throughout
 
01:27:38.430 --> 01:27:38.440 align:start position:0%
the duration of the contract the
 
01:27:39.750 --> 01:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
duration of the contract will be
 
01:27:41.990 --> 01:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
extended through June 30th
 
01:27:44.590 --> 01:27:44.600 align:start position:0%
2025 at minimum something like that see
 
01:27:46.229 --> 01:27:46.239 align:start position:0%
I I like that additional language
 
01:27:48.189 --> 01:27:48.199 align:start position:0%
because I thought that's what we
 
01:27:49.629 --> 01:27:49.639 align:start position:0%
represent Wallner I think that's what
 
01:27:50.950 --> 01:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
you and I were talking about on the
 
01:27:52.709 --> 01:27:52.719 align:start position:0%
phone we wanted somebody around to help
 
01:27:54.830 --> 01:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
us with the implementation
 
01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:56.550 align:start position:0%
us with the implementation
so

01:27:56.550 --> 01:27:56.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:28:00.830 --> 01:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
um okay so representative hold is this
 
01:28:02.470 --> 01:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
with that the fact that we want the
 
01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:04.270 align:start position:0%
with that the fact that we want the
person

01:28:04.270 --> 01:28:04.280 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:28:06.790 --> 01:28:06.800 align:start position:0%
longer the in the tail end of the
 
01:28:08.430 --> 01:28:08.440 align:start position:0%
implementation does that change your
 
01:28:11.109 --> 01:28:11.119 align:start position:0%
point of view I I'm still in support of
 
01:28:15.070 --> 01:28:15.080 align:start position:0%
the idea right again um having been a
 
01:28:17.109 --> 01:28:17.119 align:start position:0%
professional consultant for a while I
 
01:28:19.350 --> 01:28:19.360 align:start position:0%
just the dollar value that is
 
01:28:22.070 --> 01:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
effectively getting someone more than
 
01:28:24.229 --> 01:28:24.239 align:start position:0%
half time for an entire year which which
 
01:28:27.590 --> 01:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
is is a significant size contract if you
 
01:28:29.270 --> 01:28:29.280 align:start position:0%
if we find the right person who has this
 
01:28:31.070 --> 01:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
expertise whether they've done the work
 
01:28:34.109 --> 01:28:34.119 align:start position:0%
in California or Alaska doesn't matter
 
01:28:35.669 --> 01:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
where they can most of this can be done
 
01:28:37.149 --> 01:28:37.159 align:start position:0%
remotely they might have to come out
 
01:28:40.950 --> 01:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
here for some travel um but really this
 
01:28:42.750 --> 01:28:42.760 align:start position:0%
is creating a report and then being
 
01:28:44.629 --> 01:28:44.639 align:start position:0%
available as a consultant to answer
 
01:28:47.070 --> 01:28:47.080 align:start position:0%
questions for um the next budget
 
01:28:49.270 --> 01:28:49.280 align:start position:0%
creation I still think the number's High
 
01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:50.870 align:start position:0%
creation I still think the number's High
personally

01:28:50.870 --> 01:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
personally
 
01:28:53.030 --> 01:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
but that's where I'm
 
01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:55.109 align:start position:0%
but that's where I'm
at

01:28:55.109 --> 01:28:55.119 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:28:59.109 --> 01:28:59.119 align:start position:0%
any other comments representative
 
01:28:59.119 --> 01:29:00.830 align:start position:0%
any other comments representative
walner

01:29:00.830 --> 01:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
walner
 
01:29:03.350 --> 01:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
well I would like to see I would like to
 
01:29:08.270 --> 01:29:08.280 align:start position:0%
see this happen and um I think that Mr
 
01:29:11.149 --> 01:29:11.159 align:start position:0%
White we we know Mr white pretty well at
 
01:29:13.750 --> 01:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
this point I think he'll be very careful
 
01:29:17.709 --> 01:29:17.719 align:start position:0%
when he is choosing a uh consultant and
 
01:29:17.719 --> 01:29:18.390 align:start position:0%
when he is choosing a uh consultant and
he

01:29:18.390 --> 01:29:18.400 align:start position:0%
he
 
01:29:24.149 --> 01:29:24.159 align:start position:0%
will be doing it for probably the best
 
01:29:27.030 --> 01:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
buy he can find and trying to be very
 
01:29:29.669 --> 01:29:29.679 align:start position:0%
conservative with the money so I trust
 
01:29:31.510 --> 01:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
that they know what they are going to
 
01:29:33.390 --> 01:29:33.400 align:start position:0%
need in order to
 
01:29:37.109 --> 01:29:37.119 align:start position:0%
get the right person to bid on this and
 
01:29:40.550 --> 01:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
to do this work so um I'm hoping that we
 
01:29:42.590 --> 01:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
can leave it at the
 
01:29:46.189 --> 01:29:46.199 align:start position:0%
200,000 um and let the department try to
 
01:29:50.390 --> 01:29:50.400 align:start position:0%
manage that so so Mr White Mr Ripple uh
 
01:29:54.109 --> 01:29:54.119 align:start position:0%
L on line 16 that that Roman numeral 2
 
01:29:56.510 --> 01:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
section do we have to say anything or
 
01:29:58.950 --> 01:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
should we say anything about lapsing or
 
01:30:01.149 --> 01:30:01.159 align:start position:0%
non-aps it's assumed that it would lapse
 
01:30:02.830 --> 01:30:02.840 align:start position:0%
at the end of the banum if it it doesn't
 
01:30:04.830 --> 01:30:04.840 align:start position:0%
say otherwise but if we want this
 
01:30:06.149 --> 01:30:06.159 align:start position:0%
individual to help us with
 
01:30:08.550 --> 01:30:08.560 align:start position:0%
implementation we may actually not be
 
01:30:11.270 --> 01:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
implementing until a subsequent
 
01:30:13.709 --> 01:30:13.719 align:start position:0%
year um well I think you'd be
 
01:30:15.790 --> 01:30:15.800 align:start position:0%
implementing through the budget process
 
01:30:18.790 --> 01:30:18.800 align:start position:0%
that takes place in 2025 no so I'm not
 
01:30:20.550 --> 01:30:20.560 align:start position:0%
sure you would need it beyond June 30th
 
01:30:23.750 --> 01:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
of 2025 there's a provision in RSA 9
 
01:30:25.750 --> 01:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
that dollars are encumbered in a
 
01:30:27.430 --> 01:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
contract those dollars can be carried
 
01:30:30.430 --> 01:30:30.440 align:start position:0%
forward into the next biennium in RSA 9
 
01:30:32.149 --> 01:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
there's also inherent language that all
 
01:30:34.070 --> 01:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
General funds would lapse at the end of
 
01:30:36.709 --> 01:30:36.719 align:start position:0%
the year unless otherwise specified okay
 
01:30:39.030 --> 01:30:39.040 align:start position:0%
so then the only thing I'm hearing then
 
01:30:41.669 --> 01:30:41.679 align:start position:0%
that this amendment could uh be improved
 
01:30:44.070 --> 01:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
through a tweak is to make it more clear
 
01:30:46.350 --> 01:30:46.360 align:start position:0%
that this consultant has
 
01:30:47.669 --> 01:30:47.679 align:start position:0%
responsibilities during the
 
01:30:50.149 --> 01:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
implementation phase and not just the
 
01:30:53.310 --> 01:30:53.320 align:start position:0%
report can yeah go ahead Mr Ripple how
 
01:30:55.590 --> 01:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
how about something as simple as on line
 
01:30:57.430 --> 01:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
13 to assist in the preparation of this
 
01:30:59.350 --> 01:30:59.360 align:start position:0%
report comma and to assist the
 
01:31:00.790 --> 01:31:00.800 align:start position:0%
department with the implementation of
 
01:31:02.750 --> 01:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
the report's recommendations comma the
 
01:31:05.430 --> 01:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
department shall I I I I'm okay that
 
01:31:07.950 --> 01:31:07.960 align:start position:0%
feels like it does it uh representative
 
01:31:09.950 --> 01:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
B that's fine but when you're done I
 
01:31:12.629 --> 01:31:12.639 align:start position:0%
have a question oh okay represent hle
 
01:31:15.870 --> 01:31:15.880 align:start position:0%
sure can we also put in that line in the
 
01:31:17.590 --> 01:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
in the recommendations relative to the
 
01:31:20.709 --> 01:31:20.719 align:start position:0%
creation of the budget for the fiscal
 
01:31:22.910 --> 01:31:22.920 align:start position:0%
year ending
 
01:31:25.310 --> 01:31:25.320 align:start position:0%
2027 right I think this is about
 
01:31:27.910 --> 01:31:27.920 align:start position:0%
creating the budget items at next spring
 
01:31:29.470 --> 01:31:29.480 align:start position:0%
so I think that's the element that's
 
01:31:32.629 --> 01:31:32.639 align:start position:0%
important right I'm sorry which what did
 
01:31:34.310 --> 01:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
you want to add what you what did you
 
01:31:36.550 --> 01:31:36.560 align:start position:0%
want to change there line 13 to assist
 
01:31:38.070 --> 01:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
in the preparation of this report and
 
01:31:39.510 --> 01:31:39.520 align:start position:0%
then you added something and then I
 
01:31:41.550 --> 01:31:41.560 align:start position:0%
would add also right in in the
 
01:31:46.229 --> 01:31:46.239 align:start position:0%
preparation of the budget ending for the
 
01:31:51.390 --> 01:31:51.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:53.990 --> 01:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
sure further comment on this amendment
 
01:31:57.590 --> 01:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
representative wer I
 
01:32:01.149 --> 01:32:01.159 align:start position:0%
hello I'm sorry I I see my boss raise
 
01:32:04.470 --> 01:32:04.480 align:start position:0%
his hand it just it's the shiny object
 
01:32:08.229 --> 01:32:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:11.229 --> 01:32:11.239 align:start position:0%
you uh how common is it for these foster
 
01:32:12.870 --> 01:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
children to be having these Federal
 
01:32:17.030 --> 01:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
benefits is this fairly common
 
01:32:19.990 --> 01:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
it it seems to me it might not be that
 
01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:21.229 align:start position:0%
it it seems to me it might not be that
that

01:32:21.229 --> 01:32:21.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:32:24.790 --> 01:32:24.800 align:start position:0%
common so part
 
01:32:27.149 --> 01:32:27.159 align:start position:0%
the I I don't have my notes in front of
 
01:32:30.390 --> 01:32:30.400 align:start position:0%
me but the fiscal analysis where we came
 
01:32:33.149 --> 01:32:33.159 align:start position:0%
up with the estimate for $2 million of
 
01:32:35.950 --> 01:32:35.960 align:start position:0%
general fund impact um that that that's
 
01:32:37.990 --> 01:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
the the Lost Revenue that we would
 
01:32:39.270 --> 01:32:39.280 align:start position:0%
experience off the top of my head I
 
01:32:43.229 --> 01:32:43.239 align:start position:0%
believe 1.4 million of that would be for
 
01:32:44.950 --> 01:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
individuals that we're currently
 
01:32:47.430 --> 01:32:47.440 align:start position:0%
claiming tanif funds for that we would
 
01:32:51.109 --> 01:32:51.119 align:start position:0%
subsequently be uh claiming SSI for and
 
01:32:53.390 --> 01:32:53.400 align:start position:0%
then the in the other case it would be
 
01:32:55.830 --> 01:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
the s SSI dollars that we're currently
 
01:32:57.669 --> 01:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
applying towards their services that we
 
01:32:59.750 --> 01:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
would no longer be able to so we would
 
01:33:01.550 --> 01:33:01.560 align:start position:0%
have that additional general fund I
 
01:33:04.189 --> 01:33:04.199 align:start position:0%
don't have the exact population um
 
01:33:06.430 --> 01:33:06.440 align:start position:0%
figures in front of me I can go back to
 
01:33:08.590 --> 01:33:08.600 align:start position:0%
them I think more in terms of numbers
 
01:33:11.109 --> 01:33:11.119 align:start position:0%
like dollar numbers um when I'm thinking
 
01:33:14.950 --> 01:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:18.070 --> 01:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
apologize representative Earth thank you
 
01:33:19.790 --> 01:33:19.800 align:start position:0%
Mr chair this is a question for Mr
 
01:33:21.350 --> 01:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
Ripple is there any reason that we
 
01:33:23.109 --> 01:33:23.119 align:start position:0%
couldn't appropriate maybe maybe the
 
01:33:24.390 --> 01:33:24.400 align:start position:0%
wrong word but appropriate the money
 
01:33:29.189 --> 01:33:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:31.990 --> 01:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
laps are are you suggesting we just
 
01:33:34.149 --> 01:33:34.159 align:start position:0%
would authorize them to have a smaller
 
01:33:37.229 --> 01:33:37.239 align:start position:0%
lapse than what we already prescribed
 
01:33:41.149 --> 01:33:41.159 align:start position:0%
MH um so I think in that case you
 
01:33:42.709 --> 01:33:42.719 align:start position:0%
wouldn't necessarily you wouldn't need
 
01:33:45.430 --> 01:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
an appropriation at all um because it
 
01:33:47.149 --> 01:33:47.159 align:start position:0%
would come from their existing budget
 
01:33:49.430 --> 01:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
and it's money that they wouldn't
 
01:33:53.550 --> 01:33:53.560 align:start position:0%
lapse so I would try to go that route
 
01:33:53.560 --> 01:33:56.229 align:start position:0%
lapse so I would try to go that route
and

01:33:56.229 --> 01:33:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:57.870 --> 01:33:57.880 align:start position:0%
I haven't thought about it for a moment
 
01:34:01.030 --> 01:34:01.040 align:start position:0%
so my first reaction is does does that
 
01:34:03.950 --> 01:34:03.960 align:start position:0%
make it more complicated and and and if
 
01:34:05.950 --> 01:34:05.960 align:start position:0%
is there value in making it more
 
01:34:08.270 --> 01:34:08.280 align:start position:0%
complicated it's the same amount of
 
01:34:11.709 --> 01:34:11.719 align:start position:0%
dollars net anyways isn't it why why
 
01:34:14.390 --> 01:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
would is why would the net change
 
01:34:18.310 --> 01:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
because you are appropriating $200,000
 
01:34:21.510 --> 01:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
here which will go to them won't lapse
 
01:34:23.030 --> 01:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
whereas if you just take it out of what
 
01:34:25.189 --> 01:34:25.199 align:start position:0%
they already spent just will be whatever
 
01:34:27.470 --> 01:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
they need to spend up to the
 
01:34:30.189 --> 01:34:30.199 align:start position:0%
$200,000 but my question about the net
 
01:34:32.310 --> 01:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
though is if you say that you can just
 
01:34:34.709 --> 01:34:34.719 align:start position:0%
give us a smaller lapse
 
01:34:38.350 --> 01:34:38.360 align:start position:0%
number uh then then that's the money
 
01:34:40.430 --> 01:34:40.440 align:start position:0%
that smaller laps the Delta of the
 
01:34:42.590 --> 01:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
smaller laps number is the same as what
 
01:34:46.109 --> 01:34:46.119 align:start position:0%
we're adding so is there really a change
 
01:34:47.830 --> 01:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
well ask Mr Ripple but I my understand
 
01:34:52.629 --> 01:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:55.470 --> 01:34:55.480 align:start position:0%
different they are different um but I
 
01:34:56.709 --> 01:34:56.719 align:start position:0%
think if the assumption is the
 
01:34:58.870 --> 01:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
Department's going to spend $200,000 on
 
01:35:02.070 --> 01:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
this study that's a $200,000 cost either
 
01:35:04.390 --> 01:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
way it's either $200,000 that they don't
 
01:35:06.470 --> 01:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
lapse or it's $200,000 more that you
 
01:35:10.149 --> 01:35:10.159 align:start position:0%
give them um I
 
01:35:13.629 --> 01:35:13.639 align:start position:0%
think potentially the impact
 
01:35:16.270 --> 01:35:16.280 align:start position:0%
of not including an appropriation and
 
01:35:19.030 --> 01:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
staying silent on the the dollar amount
 
01:35:19.040 --> 01:35:22.629 align:start position:0%
staying silent on the the dollar amount
is

01:35:22.629 --> 01:35:22.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:22.639 --> 01:35:24.390 align:start position:0%
 
that

01:35:24.390 --> 01:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:35:26.550 --> 01:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
you know I'm going to leave that thought
 
01:35:27.870 --> 01:35:27.880 align:start position:0%
leave that thought oh that was
 
01:35:29.910 --> 01:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
intriguing go ahead see if you can see
 
01:35:31.910 --> 01:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
if you can conclude that that's a that's
 
01:35:33.910 --> 01:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
interesting where you're going I think
 
01:35:35.109 --> 01:35:35.119 align:start position:0%
as written you're directing the
 
01:35:36.790 --> 01:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
department to spend a certain dollar
 
01:35:38.910 --> 01:35:38.920 align:start position:0%
amount whereas if you contain if you
 
01:35:41.550 --> 01:35:41.560 align:start position:0%
include no appropriation um they'll
 
01:35:43.430 --> 01:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
contract for whatever amount they
 
01:35:45.830 --> 01:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
contract for um that could be less than
 
01:35:48.470 --> 01:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
200,000 it could be I don't want to say
 
01:35:50.070 --> 01:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
the Department's incentivized to spend
 
01:35:52.149 --> 01:35:52.159 align:start position:0%
as little as possible but that that
 
01:35:54.750 --> 01:35:54.760 align:start position:0%
would be the incentive right right and
 
01:35:56.830 --> 01:35:56.840 align:start position:0%
and then and then what would we do with
 
01:35:59.030 --> 01:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
lapse language anything like reducing
 
01:36:02.030 --> 01:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
the laps or I think you would include no
 
01:36:04.070 --> 01:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
Lang no language if you were inclined to
 
01:36:05.629 --> 01:36:05.639 align:start position:0%
go that route you wouldn't need an
 
01:36:07.189 --> 01:36:07.199 align:start position:0%
appropriation you wouldn't need any
 
01:36:08.910 --> 01:36:08.920 align:start position:0%
non-aps language you would just put
 
01:36:11.470 --> 01:36:11.480 align:start position:0%
nothing in there about dollars so Mr
 
01:36:13.149 --> 01:36:13.159 align:start position:0%
White shows up the fiscal committee
 
01:36:14.709 --> 01:36:14.719 align:start position:0%
saying he's broke and he doesn't have
 
01:36:18.229 --> 01:36:18.239 align:start position:0%
any more money to do anything is is it
 
01:36:20.270 --> 01:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
kind of our fault if we don't if we're
 
01:36:22.189 --> 01:36:22.199 align:start position:0%
creating a new task and we're not
 
01:36:24.590 --> 01:36:24.600 align:start position:0%
putting new money are we really doing
 
01:36:29.189 --> 01:36:29.199 align:start position:0%
our job let follow go go go ahead oh Mr
 
01:36:31.590 --> 01:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
White since you've been in this
 
01:36:33.950 --> 01:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
position do you recall what the amounts
 
01:36:35.990 --> 01:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
you were expected to lapse and how often
 
01:36:39.430 --> 01:36:39.440 align:start position:0%
you made those
 
01:36:42.189 --> 01:36:42.199 align:start position:0%
amounts yes so in in the past we
 
01:36:44.310 --> 01:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
certainly have laps dollars I I I just
 
01:36:45.750 --> 01:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
want to add a couple of points of
 
01:36:47.790 --> 01:36:47.800 align:start position:0%
clarification um number one the laps
 
01:36:51.109 --> 01:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
isn't in chapter 106 nor is it in
 
01:36:54.189 --> 01:36:54.199 align:start position:0%
chapter 79 the lapse is assumption
 
01:36:55.910 --> 01:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
included in the Surplus statement that's
 
01:36:58.189 --> 01:36:58.199 align:start position:0%
not part of state law the laps is the
 
01:37:00.070 --> 01:37:00.080 align:start position:0%
assumption that we use to balance the
 
01:37:03.189 --> 01:37:03.199 align:start position:0%
budget so the I think this year it's
 
01:37:04.990 --> 01:37:05.000 align:start position:0%
assumed 79 million laps I don't know if
 
01:37:07.629 --> 01:37:07.639 align:start position:0%
that comes out to about 4% or so um we
 
01:37:10.189 --> 01:37:10.199 align:start position:0%
do have a back of the budget cut which
 
01:37:13.070 --> 01:37:13.080 align:start position:0%
is the $23.4 million which is the money
 
01:37:16.229 --> 01:37:16.239 align:start position:0%
that it we are required obviously the
 
01:37:17.790 --> 01:37:17.800 align:start position:0%
state budget is dependent upon the laps
 
01:37:20.550 --> 01:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
and that's how we balance things um yes
 
01:37:22.590 --> 01:37:22.600 align:start position:0%
we would basically what would happen is
 
01:37:24.030 --> 01:37:24.040 align:start position:0%
we would come back
 
01:37:25.669 --> 01:37:25.679 align:start position:0%
and we would probably have a smaller
 
01:37:28.870 --> 01:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
lapse based upon whatever this cost I
 
01:37:31.350 --> 01:37:31.360 align:start position:0%
think the Challenge from my perspective
 
01:37:32.990 --> 01:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
and this is not my role sitting in the
 
01:37:34.590 --> 01:37:34.600 align:start position:0%
executive branch this is a legislative
 
01:37:37.950 --> 01:37:37.960 align:start position:0%
branch policy decision is whether you
 
01:37:41.149 --> 01:37:41.159 align:start position:0%
pass appropriate whether you pass
 
01:37:42.910 --> 01:37:42.920 align:start position:0%
requirements that you know are going to
 
01:37:45.030 --> 01:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
have a cost but do not apply an
 
01:37:47.149 --> 01:37:47.159 align:start position:0%
appropriation towards that I think
 
01:37:48.350 --> 01:37:48.360 align:start position:0%
that's where get a little less
 
01:37:50.550 --> 01:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
transparent from a budgeting perspective
 
01:37:52.550 --> 01:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
because what we'll have to do is we will
 
01:37:54.149 --> 01:37:54.159 align:start position:0%
have to come through goal probably to
 
01:37:56.830 --> 01:37:56.840 align:start position:0%
move funds into a Contracting 102 or 103
 
01:37:58.669 --> 01:37:58.679 align:start position:0%
line so you will see that at that point
 
01:38:01.310 --> 01:38:01.320 align:start position:0%
in time but it will not be shown in the
 
01:38:06.629 --> 01:38:06.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:09.229 --> 01:38:09.239 align:start position:0%
trail I think it's interesting
 
01:38:12.189 --> 01:38:12.199 align:start position:0%
that it's as much as 79 million and it's
 
01:38:13.950 --> 01:38:13.960 align:start position:0%
4% I think that's something we could
 
01:38:16.270 --> 01:38:16.280 align:start position:0%
keep in mind that you know that's an
 
01:38:19.430 --> 01:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
expectation and I have have you made it
 
01:38:22.270 --> 01:38:22.280 align:start position:0%
before the ex within the
 
01:38:24.629 --> 01:38:24.639 align:start position:0%
expectation yes yes the first year of
 
01:38:27.390 --> 01:38:27.400 align:start position:0%
the bium is typically smaller currently
 
01:38:30.830 --> 01:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
we are projecting a very small lapse the
 
01:38:34.109 --> 01:38:34.119 align:start position:0%
previous bium the previous bium we did
 
01:38:38.229 --> 01:38:38.239 align:start position:0%
lapse um did you make the 4% yes at the
 
01:38:40.030 --> 01:38:40.040 align:start position:0%
end of the bium that's what I remembered
 
01:38:41.750 --> 01:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
is you were better at this than some of
 
01:38:44.629 --> 01:38:44.639 align:start position:0%
your predecessors so correct thank you
 
01:38:48.629 --> 01:38:48.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:51.830 --> 01:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
hold you know the way the way I see this
 
01:38:54.750 --> 01:38:54.760 align:start position:0%
exercise and not just talking about this
 
01:39:00.270 --> 01:39:00.280 align:start position:0%
one bill but um we're uh in this second
 
01:39:04.910 --> 01:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
year of the banum passing new uh uh
 
01:39:06.669 --> 01:39:06.679 align:start position:0%
requirements for
 
01:39:08.990 --> 01:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
expenditure and uh they're going to come
 
01:39:11.109 --> 01:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
from a lot of different directions three
 
01:39:14.030 --> 01:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
different Finance committees and at some
 
01:39:16.750 --> 01:39:16.760 align:start position:0%
point we're going to decide which ones
 
01:39:18.669 --> 01:39:18.679 align:start position:0%
we can afford to do hopefully all of
 
01:39:21.669 --> 01:39:21.679 align:start position:0%
them but if there's too much money being
 
01:39:23.390 --> 01:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
spent and we can't do them all
 
01:39:25.950 --> 01:39:25.960 align:start position:0%
apparently there'll be another process
 
01:39:29.030 --> 01:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
to prioritize things and if we just take
 
01:39:31.550 --> 01:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
one bill here and say well this one has
 
01:39:33.709 --> 01:39:33.719 align:start position:0%
no cost they're just going to say okay
 
01:39:35.350 --> 01:39:35.360 align:start position:0%
we'll put that one through that has no
 
01:39:37.790 --> 01:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
cost and if we do that for a lot a lot
 
01:39:39.430 --> 01:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
of these different bills as we've done
 
01:39:43.310 --> 01:39:43.320 align:start position:0%
is heaped on uh uh uh Mr White is a lot
 
01:39:45.390 --> 01:39:45.400 align:start position:0%
of EX a lot of requirements with no
 
01:39:47.390 --> 01:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
money because when we go through the
 
01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:48.910 align:start position:0%
money because when we go through the
prioritization

01:39:48.910 --> 01:39:48.920 align:start position:0%
prioritization
 
01:39:51.350 --> 01:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
exercise um these bills will have been
 
01:39:54.550 --> 01:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
on different footing so uh if 200,000 is
 
01:39:56.750 --> 01:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
a reasonable number for what we want to
 
01:40:01.149 --> 01:40:01.159 align:start position:0%
do and um I would prefer that we
 
01:40:03.990 --> 01:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
actually appropriate it at this and and
 
01:40:05.790 --> 01:40:05.800 align:start position:0%
put it in the amendment at this this
 
01:40:09.669 --> 01:40:09.679 align:start position:0%
time for this bill uh and and uh being
 
01:40:12.470 --> 01:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
the appropriate exercise for everything
 
01:40:16.830 --> 01:40:16.840 align:start position:0%
else that follows this person
 
01:40:19.709 --> 01:40:19.719 align:start position:0%
whole thank you and maybe either Mr
 
01:40:22.109 --> 01:40:22.119 align:start position:0%
White or Mr Ripple will know the answer
 
01:40:25.669 --> 01:40:25.679 align:start position:0%
if we were to up update the laps the 23
 
01:40:29.109 --> 01:40:29.119 align:start position:0%
something million that was requested in
 
01:40:31.910 --> 01:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
the budget in hb2 could that be modified
 
01:40:32.910 --> 01:40:32.920 align:start position:0%
down by the
 
01:40:36.790 --> 01:40:36.800 align:start position:0%
$200,000 and captured in an amendment
 
01:40:39.870 --> 01:40:39.880 align:start position:0%
here well the laps assumption is not
 
01:40:42.510 --> 01:40:42.520 align:start position:0%
contained in state law any anywhere it's
 
01:40:44.470 --> 01:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
in the uh Surplus statement prepared by
 
01:40:47.629 --> 01:40:47.639 align:start position:0%
the LBA only so no Amendment would be
 
01:40:49.510 --> 01:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
necessary this was the back of the
 
01:40:52.350 --> 01:40:52.360 align:start position:0%
budget cut that was 23.4 Million I
 
01:40:55.430 --> 01:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
thought was in H too I see the I'm sorry
 
01:40:57.070 --> 01:40:57.080 align:start position:0%
the lapse is an assumption in the
 
01:40:58.470 --> 01:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
Surplus statement only the back of the
 
01:41:00.870 --> 01:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
budget cut yes that's in uh the back of
 
01:41:03.629 --> 01:41:03.639 align:start position:0%
house bill one so that could be modified
 
01:41:05.709 --> 01:41:05.719 align:start position:0%
by the $200,000 if you were inclined to
 
01:41:07.470 --> 01:41:07.480 align:start position:0%
go that route is there a way to do that
 
01:41:08.470 --> 01:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
in an
 
01:41:10.790 --> 01:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
amendment yep it could
 
01:41:13.430 --> 01:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
be this amendment could be redrafted to
 
01:41:16.669 --> 01:41:16.679 align:start position:0%
also amend House Bill one from last
 
01:41:19.510 --> 01:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
session I I would be in favor of that
 
01:41:22.109 --> 01:41:22.119 align:start position:0%
all right representative tersi sorry I
 
01:41:25.310 --> 01:41:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:27.149 --> 01:41:27.159 align:start position:0%
I think we have just gone down a
 
01:41:30.470 --> 01:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
complicated rabbit hole that is entirely
 
01:41:33.669 --> 01:41:33.679 align:start position:0%
unnecessary I mean we started with a
 
01:41:37.550 --> 01:41:37.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal note that I think we all said
 
01:41:38.510 --> 01:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
this is
 
01:41:41.510 --> 01:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
concerning representative walner did
 
01:41:44.109 --> 01:41:44.119 align:start position:0%
some work did some creative thinking
 
01:41:48.470 --> 01:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
figured out a way that we can start the
 
01:41:51.950 --> 01:41:51.960 align:start position:0%
process to address this issue of
 
01:41:53.790 --> 01:41:53.800 align:start position:0%
children in our care that are receiving
 
01:41:55.629 --> 01:41:55.639 align:start position:0%
Social Security
 
01:41:58.510 --> 01:41:58.520 align:start position:0%
payments um I personally would have
 
01:42:01.510 --> 01:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
liked to have gone further with the
 
01:42:04.790 --> 01:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
original Bill however I think that the
 
01:42:06.950 --> 01:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
proposal that was drafted here by hiring
 
01:42:09.790 --> 01:42:09.800 align:start position:0%
the consultant is a wonderful first step
 
01:42:12.310 --> 01:42:12.320 align:start position:0%
that we will be able to have the
 
01:42:15.310 --> 01:42:15.320 align:start position:0%
information and the data and specifics
 
01:42:18.550 --> 01:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
on where we need to go with our next
 
01:42:21.830 --> 01:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
budget I 100% agree we should not be
 
01:42:23.750 --> 01:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
passing things and just hoping that
 
01:42:25.229 --> 01:42:25.239 align:start position:0%
there's change in the bottom of the
 
01:42:26.750 --> 01:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
pocket that are going to be able to pay
 
01:42:29.070 --> 01:42:29.080 align:start position:0%
for it I think that just sets a
 
01:42:31.790 --> 01:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
dangerous precedent and um it's like
 
01:42:34.629 --> 01:42:34.639 align:start position:0%
we're just passing things wishing and
 
01:42:37.750 --> 01:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
hoping that things get budgeted for and
 
01:42:40.629 --> 01:42:40.639 align:start position:0%
I hope that we can agree that the
 
01:42:43.990 --> 01:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
language that we had to um have the
 
01:42:45.470 --> 01:42:45.480 align:start position:0%
consultant work through the budget
 
01:42:47.790 --> 01:42:47.800 align:start position:0%
process I think that was an excellent
 
01:42:50.589 --> 01:42:50.599 align:start position:0%
suggestion um I'm happy to hear that the
 
01:42:53.390 --> 01:42:53.400 align:start position:0%
intention is to have them available to
 
01:42:54.990 --> 01:42:55.000 align:start position:0%
guide us through the budget process with
 
01:42:58.470 --> 01:42:58.480 align:start position:0%
the report and I hope that we can um go
 
01:43:02.270 --> 01:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:02.280 --> 01:43:04.390 align:start position:0%
 
amendment

01:43:04.390 --> 01:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:43:06.950 --> 01:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
representative so while I respect your
 
01:43:08.709 --> 01:43:08.719 align:start position:0%
point of view and I don't really
 
01:43:10.070 --> 01:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
disagree with it except for the
 
01:43:13.390 --> 01:43:13.400 align:start position:0%
following the precedent I see a setting
 
01:43:16.589 --> 01:43:16.599 align:start position:0%
is the base we're putting at Consultants
 
01:43:18.709 --> 01:43:18.719 align:start position:0%
fees this is an incredibly High base
 
01:43:20.990 --> 01:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
I've been in the software business for
 
01:43:24.390 --> 01:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
40 years and I'm a fairly well-paid
 
01:43:28.229 --> 01:43:28.239 align:start position:0%
consultant I've never this is a $400,000
 
01:43:31.669 --> 01:43:31.679 align:start position:0%
per year rate which is pretty stiff the
 
01:43:33.189 --> 01:43:33.199 align:start position:0%
only thing I was trying to do was to get
 
01:43:35.750 --> 01:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
to the point of let them spend the money
 
01:43:37.510 --> 01:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
that they need to do what you're asking
 
01:43:39.350 --> 01:43:39.360 align:start position:0%
to do I agree this is
 
01:43:41.550 --> 01:43:41.560 align:start position:0%
fantastic but to set the precedent that
 
01:43:43.470 --> 01:43:43.480 align:start position:0%
we should
 
01:43:46.390 --> 01:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
be laying down rates like this is a I
 
01:43:51.629 --> 01:43:51.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:53.709 --> 01:43:53.719 align:start position:0%
honestly uh
 
01:43:55.310 --> 01:43:55.320 align:start position:0%
I think my concern is about the total
 
01:43:58.589 --> 01:43:58.599 align:start position:0%
value Echo um representative Earth's
 
01:44:01.990 --> 01:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
concerns um and I come at that from
 
01:44:06.390 --> 01:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
being in also being a consultant in in a
 
01:44:10.510 --> 01:44:10.520 align:start position:0%
wellp feel I guess if we take it as a as
 
01:44:14.109 --> 01:44:14.119 align:start position:0%
a change to to the mandated laps in hb2
 
01:44:16.270 --> 01:44:16.280 align:start position:0%
the department is really going to be
 
01:44:18.950 --> 01:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
optimizing their costs potentially
 
01:44:20.669 --> 01:44:20.679 align:start position:0%
differently than if we just allocate the
 
01:44:22.470 --> 01:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
money because at the end of the day
 
01:44:24.629 --> 01:44:24.639 align:start position:0%
they're still going to have to manage
 
01:44:26.470 --> 01:44:26.480 align:start position:0%
trying to hit that laps request that's
 
01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:27.550 align:start position:0%
trying to hit that laps request that's
in

01:44:27.550 --> 01:44:27.560 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:44:31.750 --> 01:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
hb1 and they can juggle the cost of this
 
01:44:33.669 --> 01:44:33.679 align:start position:0%
consultant versus the other things that
 
01:44:35.669 --> 01:44:35.679 align:start position:0%
they have to get done priority wise
 
01:44:37.189 --> 01:44:37.199 align:start position:0%
which is slightly different in terms of
 
01:44:39.229 --> 01:44:39.239 align:start position:0%
an implementation and and that's my
 
01:44:41.870 --> 01:44:41.880 align:start position:0%
opinion but I think we do incentivize
 
01:44:44.229 --> 01:44:44.239 align:start position:0%
them to optimize that number and I was
 
01:44:46.550 --> 01:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
asking for a lower number I'm okay with
 
01:44:48.910 --> 01:44:48.920 align:start position:0%
the change of the $200,000 but if we do
 
01:44:53.070 --> 01:44:53.080 align:start position:0%
it via changing the hb1 laps value I
 
01:44:56.189 --> 01:44:56.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:59.270 --> 01:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
off representative Leon um thank you Mr
 
01:45:01.390 --> 01:45:01.400 align:start position:0%
chairman I I think what I'm hearing from
 
01:45:03.030 --> 01:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
this is we all agree that this is an
 
01:45:04.629 --> 01:45:04.639 align:start position:0%
important job we just have a question
 
01:45:06.390 --> 01:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
about how best to do it and what
 
01:45:09.229 --> 01:45:09.239 align:start position:0%
anchoring points we're setting um the
 
01:45:10.990 --> 01:45:11.000 align:start position:0%
points that have been made over here are
 
01:45:14.350 --> 01:45:14.360 align:start position:0%
why um I probably I guess I'll vote
 
01:45:15.950 --> 01:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
against it because I think a back of I
 
01:45:17.070 --> 01:45:17.080 align:start position:0%
think this other one where we're not
 
01:45:19.430 --> 01:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
anchoring to the $200,000 I like that
 
01:45:20.990 --> 01:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
point of not anchoring the cost of the
 
01:45:23.310 --> 01:45:23.320 align:start position:0%
contract but I think that this is really
 
01:45:24.790 --> 01:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
good work and I expect it'll probably
 
01:45:26.910 --> 01:45:26.920 align:start position:0%
pass this committee it's just an idea of
 
01:45:29.030 --> 01:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
setting that cost of the contract at
 
01:45:31.709 --> 01:45:31.719 align:start position:0%
$200,000 I'm still new um it's just part
 
01:45:33.310 --> 01:45:33.320 align:start position:0%
of my confusion within this whole
 
01:45:34.990 --> 01:45:35.000 align:start position:0%
process but I think that those are
 
01:45:38.629 --> 01:45:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:41.470 --> 01:45:41.480 align:start position:0%
raised so the precedent that I would
 
01:45:44.270 --> 01:45:44.280 align:start position:0%
hope that we would stick to that's been
 
01:45:46.550 --> 01:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
established in the past hopefully is
 
01:45:49.350 --> 01:45:49.360 align:start position:0%
that if we legally require the
 
01:45:52.470 --> 01:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
department to do new work incremental
 
01:45:54.830 --> 01:45:54.840 align:start position:0%
new work work then we should put the
 
01:45:57.430 --> 01:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
incremental dollars necessary for them
 
01:46:02.950 --> 01:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
to do that work uh if we say you do this
 
01:46:05.310 --> 01:46:05.320 align:start position:0%
work if you have the money and you can
 
01:46:07.990 --> 01:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
prioritize it then that changes our
 
01:46:09.870 --> 01:46:09.880 align:start position:0%
recommendation we're no longer telling
 
01:46:11.629 --> 01:46:11.639 align:start position:0%
them to do it we're telling them to
 
01:46:14.750 --> 01:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
think about it and so I I believe what
 
01:46:17.430 --> 01:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
we've a what we want in this amendment
 
01:46:19.790 --> 01:46:19.800 align:start position:0%
is we want to direct them to do it if
 
01:46:21.910 --> 01:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to direct them to do it it
 
01:46:24.550 --> 01:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
seems to me that we have the obligation
 
01:46:27.589 --> 01:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
to fund the new work whether the dollar
 
01:46:29.550 --> 01:46:29.560 align:start position:0%
amount is right is a different thing I
 
01:46:31.750 --> 01:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
you know if you want to make it 150 or
 
01:46:33.950 --> 01:46:33.960 align:start position:0%
something and and let the department
 
01:46:35.750 --> 01:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
figure out if it turns out to be more
 
01:46:38.149 --> 01:46:38.159 align:start position:0%
than that I'm I'm good with that I just
 
01:46:41.030 --> 01:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
like the principle of you must do new
 
01:46:43.629 --> 01:46:43.639 align:start position:0%
work here are the resources to to get it
 
01:46:47.030 --> 01:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
done uh representative priest thank you
 
01:46:50.669 --> 01:46:50.679 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um again I guess there's a
 
01:46:52.910 --> 01:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
lot of Consultants or previous
 
01:46:54.910 --> 01:46:54.920 align:start position:0%
Consultants around this table because I
 
01:46:58.430 --> 01:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
was also one in one time and I and I
 
01:47:00.709 --> 01:47:00.719 align:start position:0%
really believe yeah and I and I believe
 
01:47:01.950 --> 01:47:01.960 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:47:06.270 --> 01:47:06.280 align:start position:0%
20,000 is a very um realistic number and
 
01:47:08.390 --> 01:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
we've heard from the Department that it
 
01:47:13.149 --> 01:47:13.159 align:start position:0%
will be up to two 200,000 and so if they
 
01:47:15.910 --> 01:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
can get a con consultant less I think
 
01:47:18.310 --> 01:47:18.320 align:start position:0%
they will do that and it's just not
 
01:47:21.070 --> 01:47:21.080 align:start position:0%
writing a report it's the actual
 
01:47:23.990 --> 01:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
implementation of it with the department
 
01:47:27.189 --> 01:47:27.199 align:start position:0%
and that is very time consuming so I
 
01:47:29.669 --> 01:47:29.679 align:start position:0%
think this amendment makes sense and I
 
01:47:32.270 --> 01:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
think uh I would like to make a motion
 
01:47:43.149 --> 01:47:43.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:46.229 --> 01:47:46.239 align:start position:0%
H after we make the
 
01:47:49.270 --> 01:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
trats can I ask clarification on that
 
01:47:51.830 --> 01:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
though we we we had a sidebar with Mr
 
01:47:53.950 --> 01:47:53.960 align:start position:0%
Ripple about about modifying the
 
01:47:56.870 --> 01:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
language to make it more clear that we
 
01:47:59.310 --> 01:47:59.320 align:start position:0%
want this consultant to continue in the
 
01:48:01.589 --> 01:48:01.599 align:start position:0%
post report phase to help us in the
 
01:48:05.350 --> 01:48:05.360 align:start position:0%
implementation phase so so so we're not
 
01:48:07.270 --> 01:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
is your motion is not literally to
 
01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:08.149 align:start position:0%
is your motion is not literally to
approve

01:48:08.149 --> 01:48:08.159 align:start position:0%
approve
 
01:48:10.990 --> 01:48:11.000 align:start position:0%
1286 your motion as I understand it is
 
01:48:13.310 --> 01:48:13.320 align:start position:0%
to approve 28
 
01:48:15.830 --> 01:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
1286 with the additional language
 
01:48:17.830 --> 01:48:17.840 align:start position:0%
regarding being available in the
 
01:48:20.310 --> 01:48:20.320 align:start position:0%
impementation correct correct correct
 
01:48:24.229 --> 01:48:24.239 align:start position:0%
yes I was assuming that that was in
 
01:48:25.669 --> 01:48:25.679 align:start position:0%
they just want to be clear so that
 
01:48:27.310 --> 01:48:27.320 align:start position:0%
people know what they're voting on
 
01:48:31.390 --> 01:48:31.400 align:start position:0%
exactly okay and then your second covers
 
01:48:35.750 --> 01:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
that oh I'm sorry so yeah second
 
01:48:42.390 --> 01:48:42.400 align:start position:0%
okay okay um so so with that um you've
 
01:48:44.189 --> 01:48:44.199 align:start position:0%
made a motion is there any further
 
01:48:45.990 --> 01:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
discussion on the on the motion
 
01:48:49.149 --> 01:48:49.159 align:start position:0%
representative string uh I also am a
 
01:48:51.910 --> 01:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
consultant so because I joined the group
 
01:48:57.950 --> 01:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:01.030 --> 01:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
way so this is what happens when when we
 
01:49:04.270 --> 01:49:04.280 align:start position:0%
don't get new Consulting gigs I guess
 
01:49:06.669 --> 01:49:06.679 align:start position:0%
and so so you know these kind of
 
01:49:08.750 --> 01:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
projects in in the types of firms I've
 
01:49:10.430 --> 01:49:10.440 align:start position:0%
work and they're done by five and six
 
01:49:13.109 --> 01:49:13.119 align:start position:0%
people not by not by one person with a
 
01:49:18.709 --> 01:49:18.719 align:start position:0%
special expertise in there and um but um
 
01:49:22.310 --> 01:49:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh you know I F first of all I I think
 
01:49:23.589 --> 01:49:23.599 align:start position:0%
taking the the money out of the back of
 
01:49:25.350 --> 01:49:25.360 align:start position:0%
the envelope is just a little too cute
 
01:49:27.910 --> 01:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
for the process I'd much prefer to
 
01:49:30.669 --> 01:49:30.679 align:start position:0%
appropriate it um I would support this
 
01:49:33.109 --> 01:49:33.119 align:start position:0%
amendment I'd also support if it was
 
01:49:36.430 --> 01:49:36.440 align:start position:0%
$150,000 I think that's probably a
 
01:49:37.990 --> 01:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
pretty solid amount of money for
 
01:49:42.270 --> 01:49:42.280 align:start position:0%
everything that's in in in the group um
 
01:49:45.109 --> 01:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
uh but um so that that's just kind of
 
01:49:47.030 --> 01:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
where I am so represented priest would
 
01:49:49.109 --> 01:49:49.119 align:start position:0%
you be open in modifying your amendment
 
01:49:55.149 --> 01:49:55.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:57.870 --> 01:49:57.880 align:start position:0%
okay all
 
01:50:01.950 --> 01:50:01.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:05.350 --> 01:50:05.360 align:start position:0%
conversation all right so I'll I'll take
 
01:50:08.350 --> 01:50:08.360 align:start position:0%
a show of hands uh all those in favor of
 
01:50:11.350 --> 01:50:11.360 align:start position:0%
1286 is verbally modified please raise
 
01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:13.109 align:start position:0%
1286 is verbally modified please raise
your

01:50:13.109 --> 01:50:13.119 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:50:15.510 --> 01:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
hand for the amendment the amendment
 
01:50:19.470 --> 01:50:19.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:23.229 --> 01:50:23.239 align:start position:0%
number right okay so so I think that was
 
01:50:27.430 --> 01:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
90 any any oh it wasn't any well I'll
 
01:50:28.790 --> 01:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
find out any
 
01:50:33.709 --> 01:50:33.719 align:start position:0%
opposed okay so 91 or 81 rather
 
01:50:33.719 --> 01:50:35.229 align:start position:0%
opposed okay so 91 or 81 rather
81

01:50:35.229 --> 01:50:35.239 align:start position:0%
81
 
01:50:39.390 --> 01:50:39.400 align:start position:0%
um okay so now we need uh an
 
01:50:47.310 --> 01:50:47.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:51.629 --> 01:50:51.639 align:start position:0%

01:51:51.629 --> 01:51:51.639 align:start position:0%
passes okay did now in passing
 
01:51:53.430 --> 01:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
representative wner you mentioned that
 
01:51:56.390 --> 01:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
you had a variety of amendments we could
 
01:51:58.870 --> 01:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
choose from I I are you going to offer
 
01:52:05.550 --> 01:52:05.560 align:start position:0%
any of them okay thank you oh God okay
 
01:52:10.550 --> 01:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
so it is 150 we have one more thing on
 
01:52:14.270 --> 01:52:14.280 align:start position:0%
our chart and that is house bill
 
01:52:18.430 --> 01:52:18.440 align:start position:0%
1573 you want to give us
 
01:52:22.069 --> 01:52:22.079 align:start position:0%
uh yeah we did 1282 yes sir that was
 
01:52:25.149 --> 01:52:25.159 align:start position:0%
amongst the three that I verified at the
 
01:52:27.350 --> 01:52:27.360 align:start position:0%
very beginning that our Monday
 
01:52:30.669 --> 01:52:30.679 align:start position:0%
recommendation of O otpa stood and
 
01:52:33.189 --> 01:52:33.199 align:start position:0%
nobody challenged it do you do you wish
 
01:52:35.550 --> 01:52:35.560 align:start position:0%
to challenge the OT I see it on my notes
 
01:52:40.310 --> 01:52:40.320 align:start position:0%
9 to zero okay okay all right
 
01:52:46.709 --> 01:52:46.719 align:start position:0%
1593 1593 was also an otpa that we did
 
01:52:49.030 --> 01:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
Monday so I just received those two
 
01:52:50.470 --> 01:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
amendments and sent them to the printer
 
01:52:52.189 --> 01:52:52.199 align:start position:0%
so in a few minutes I should have those
 
01:52:54.350 --> 01:52:54.360 align:start position:0%
two okay so let's do this I I want to
 
01:52:56.069 --> 01:52:56.079 align:start position:0%

02:01:50.830 --> 02:01:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:50.840 --> 02:01:57.510 align:start position:0%
 
moment

02:01:57.510 --> 02:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:00.870 --> 02:02:00.880 align:start position:0%
I I I should have noticed noted famous
 
02:02:04.830 --> 02:02:04.840 align:start position:0%
birthdays today Lila that inspired Eric
 
02:02:08.390 --> 02:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
Clapton's song turns 80 today and
 
02:02:12.270 --> 02:02:12.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:12.280 --> 02:02:15.550 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:02:15.550 --> 02:02:15.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:15.560 --> 02:02:17.950 align:start position:0%
 
932

02:02:17.950 --> 02:02:17.960 align:start position:0%
932
 
02:02:20.709 --> 02:02:20.719 align:start position:0%
yeah so I'm running out of things to say
 
02:02:26.069 --> 02:02:26.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:29.430 --> 02:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
back well the first things I want to say
 
02:02:50.830 --> 02:02:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:50.840 --> 02:03:20.270 align:start position:0%
 
though

02:03:20.270 --> 02:03:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:22.069 --> 02:03:22.079 align:start position:0%
I'm so cold up there in the second bro
 
02:03:25.510 --> 02:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
too I was glad I was wearing my uh
 
02:03:28.470 --> 02:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
blanket it's uh it's really a cake but
 
02:03:34.390 --> 02:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:36.390 --> 02:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
blanket because it's an expensive
 
02:03:42.390 --> 02:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:45.750 --> 02:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
it um it's a casm wool BL so it does an
 
02:03:50.709 --> 02:03:50.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:50.719 --> 02:04:04.470 align:start position:0%
 
warm

02:04:04.470 --> 02:04:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:07.390 --> 02:04:07.400 align:start position:0%
all right I think we're all back and uh
 
02:04:09.990 --> 02:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
I'm going to call us out a recess we're
 
02:04:14.030 --> 02:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
here to talk about House Bill
 
02:04:16.950 --> 02:04:16.960 align:start position:0%
1573 uh we've talked about this several
 
02:04:21.830 --> 02:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
work sessions and and so um I I think uh
 
02:04:25.350 --> 02:04:25.360 align:start position:0%
um folks who've been following along
 
02:04:28.149 --> 02:04:28.159 align:start position:0%
realize that uh
 
02:04:31.030 --> 02:04:31.040 align:start position:0%
just m Miss Morris would you would you
 
02:04:33.709 --> 02:04:33.719 align:start position:0%
sit up at the
 
02:04:36.549 --> 02:04:36.559 align:start position:0%
table because I I'm going to go through
 
02:04:39.270 --> 02:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
the amendments to the Amendments uh and
 
02:04:41.790 --> 02:04:41.800 align:start position:0%
I I just need you to make sure I I don't
 
02:04:45.149 --> 02:04:45.159 align:start position:0%
misstate um okay so we we've been going
 
02:04:49.470 --> 02:04:49.480 align:start position:0%
through this uh Miss Morris
 
02:04:52.750 --> 02:04:52.760 align:start position:0%
Miss Lisa I'm so sorry I'm going to put
 
02:04:52.760 --> 02:04:53.990 align:start position:0%
Miss Lisa I'm so sorry I'm going to put
your

02:04:53.990 --> 02:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
your
 
02:04:59.990 --> 02:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:03.430 --> 02:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
machete no yeah yeah I'm going to need a
 
02:05:05.390 --> 02:05:05.400 align:start position:0%
business card for I will never get it
 
02:05:07.470 --> 02:05:07.480 align:start position:0%
right until I like look at your business
 
02:05:12.310 --> 02:05:12.320 align:start position:0%
card uh and and then uh Elizabeth KGAN
 
02:05:15.229 --> 02:05:15.239 align:start position:0%
from right did I say it right she's
 
02:05:19.629 --> 02:05:19.639 align:start position:0%
Aaron Aaron oh okay I I like I like
 
02:05:21.430 --> 02:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
Elizabeth too if you want to change her
 
02:05:25.470 --> 02:05:25.480 align:start position:0%
name at this point but um the the the
 
02:05:28.910 --> 02:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
three of them and others have just been
 
02:05:32.589 --> 02:05:32.599 align:start position:0%
working really really hard on this and
 
02:05:35.990 --> 02:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
um and for those who worry about Finance
 
02:05:39.870 --> 02:05:39.880 align:start position:0%
getting into policy I I will rationalize
 
02:05:43.069 --> 02:05:43.079 align:start position:0%
my behavior uh whenever I do this by
 
02:05:45.910 --> 02:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
thinking that it's a part of our
 
02:05:49.350 --> 02:05:49.360 align:start position:0%
fiducial responsibility our fiduciary
 
02:05:52.669 --> 02:05:52.679 align:start position:0%
responsibility to make sure that that uh
 
02:05:57.109 --> 02:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
we uh get the cost structure of any bill
 
02:05:59.750 --> 02:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
down to where it's a sustainable and
 
02:06:02.510 --> 02:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
effective bill that and I know people
 
02:06:04.870 --> 02:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
disagree with that but but I I that's
 
02:06:08.709 --> 02:06:08.719 align:start position:0%
what I think uh part of our Charter is
 
02:06:12.270 --> 02:06:12.280 align:start position:0%
and so we've been working on the policy
 
02:06:14.709 --> 02:06:14.719 align:start position:0%
side a lot on
 
02:06:18.030 --> 02:06:18.040 align:start position:0%
1573 thinking that
 
02:06:21.950 --> 02:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
by making agreements uh on the policy
 
02:06:23.790 --> 02:06:23.800 align:start position:0%
side of this
 
02:06:26.910 --> 02:06:26.920 align:start position:0%
bill that we would continue to protect
 
02:06:28.669 --> 02:06:28.679 align:start position:0%
children that we would meet the
 
02:06:30.990 --> 02:06:31.000 align:start position:0%
expectations that that we have of
 
02:06:33.430 --> 02:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
ourselves and that the OCA is here to
 
02:06:36.310 --> 02:06:36.320 align:start position:0%
help remind us of and and that we would
 
02:06:39.549 --> 02:06:39.559 align:start position:0%
do it in a way in which the program was
 
02:06:42.870 --> 02:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
going to be uh inherently more
 
02:06:45.750 --> 02:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
sustainable than the way that the policy
 
02:06:47.109 --> 02:06:47.119 align:start position:0%
was initially
 
02:06:50.310 --> 02:06:50.320 align:start position:0%
proposed and I I think I haven't looked
 
02:06:52.549 --> 02:06:52.559 align:start position:0%
at the numbers but I I think we did
 
02:06:55.790 --> 02:06:55.800 align:start position:0%
reduce the overall initial fiscal note
 
02:06:59.109 --> 02:06:59.119 align:start position:0%
by what we've done if you if you flip to
 
02:07:01.350 --> 02:07:01.360 align:start position:0%
like Pages
 
02:07:04.750 --> 02:07:04.760 align:start position:0%
um six of the big Amendment which is
 
02:07:04.760 --> 02:07:06.990 align:start position:0%
um six of the big Amendment which is
labeled

02:07:06.990 --> 02:07:07.000 align:start position:0%
labeled
 
02:07:10.350 --> 02:07:10.360 align:start position:0%
1290 um you'll I think you'll start to
 
02:07:12.189 --> 02:07:12.199 align:start position:0%
see and and maybe it's for the first
 
02:07:15.189 --> 02:07:15.199 align:start position:0%
time the the the impact the headcount
 
02:07:19.950 --> 02:07:19.960 align:start position:0%
impact where on lines 32 to 33 we've got
 
02:07:25.149 --> 02:07:25.159 align:start position:0%
four FTE there on the next page on line
 
02:07:29.830 --> 02:07:29.840 align:start position:0%
six and seven we have 10 FTE on line 15
 
02:07:33.629 --> 02:07:33.639 align:start position:0%
of that page we' got one more FTE so if
 
02:07:36.350 --> 02:07:36.360 align:start position:0%
I I may be missing some FTE but but
 
02:07:37.589 --> 02:07:37.599 align:start position:0%
that's at least
 
02:07:40.830 --> 02:07:40.840 align:start position:0%
15 that's a bunch of people for for this
 
02:07:44.709 --> 02:07:44.719 align:start position:0%
program now um I will say that what
 
02:07:48.470 --> 02:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
happened in Tennessee was horrible I
 
02:07:50.669 --> 02:07:50.679 align:start position:0%
will say that the people in Tennessee
 
02:07:53.390 --> 02:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
failed to to do their duty to live up to
 
02:07:55.910 --> 02:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
what we thought their obligations were
 
02:07:59.510 --> 02:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
and that we probably failed to do the
 
02:08:02.149 --> 02:08:02.159 align:start position:0%
proper compliance verifications and it
 
02:08:04.830 --> 02:08:04.840 align:start position:0%
was a bad bad
 
02:08:09.189 --> 02:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
thing I think that it's my perception
 
02:08:14.270 --> 02:08:14.280 align:start position:0%
that this bill is largely intended to uh
 
02:08:20.790 --> 02:08:20.800 align:start position:0%
address that that gross error um in a
 
02:08:22.069 --> 02:08:22.079 align:start position:0%
way in which
 
02:08:25.549 --> 02:08:25.559 align:start position:0%
I I it it has felt to me from the outset
 
02:08:28.030 --> 02:08:28.040 align:start position:0%
that that this bill is over engineering
 
02:08:31.830 --> 02:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
a solution it's putting too much into
 
02:08:35.069 --> 02:08:35.079 align:start position:0%
statute that really ought to be
 
02:08:37.510 --> 02:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
something that goes into the rules or
 
02:08:39.870 --> 02:08:39.880 align:start position:0%
goes into departmental
 
02:08:44.149 --> 02:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
policy um and I and I and I think this I
 
02:08:47.629 --> 02:08:47.639 align:start position:0%
think this uh uh proposal has always
 
02:08:49.950 --> 02:08:49.960 align:start position:0%
been just too thick with things that
 
02:08:52.669 --> 02:08:52.679 align:start position:0%
belonged in policy and and as an example
 
02:08:54.950 --> 02:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
of that I
 
02:08:58.589 --> 02:08:58.599 align:start position:0%
offer um where it talked about a safe
 
02:09:02.430 --> 02:09:02.440 align:start position:0%
place and how it was important that the
 
02:09:05.430 --> 02:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
the the child and the uh and the casew
 
02:09:09.229 --> 02:09:09.239 align:start position:0%
worker find a safe place to talk about
 
02:09:11.950 --> 02:09:11.960 align:start position:0%
okay I think that's really great from a
 
02:09:15.950 --> 02:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
a a therapeutic uh perspective and uh
 
02:09:17.750 --> 02:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
but I don't think that needs to be in
 
02:09:20.189 --> 02:09:20.199 align:start position:0%
law this is just an example of where
 
02:09:22.270 --> 02:09:22.280 align:start position:0%
we're putting too much to the law that
 
02:09:26.669 --> 02:09:26.679 align:start position:0%
should really be living um in in policy
 
02:09:30.470 --> 02:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
that's just an example so so I I'm I'm
 
02:09:34.470 --> 02:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
going to uh offer up
 
02:09:38.910 --> 02:09:38.920 align:start position:0%
1290 as um respect for all the work
 
02:09:41.870 --> 02:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
that's been done and to transfer the
 
02:09:43.990 --> 02:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
amendment process from representative
 
02:09:46.709 --> 02:09:46.719 align:start position:0%
Pearson to somebody on division three I
 
02:09:48.830 --> 02:09:48.840 align:start position:0%
think that's proper protocol or in the
 
02:09:51.830 --> 02:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
into Finance at least and I and in this
 
02:09:54.750 --> 02:09:54.760 align:start position:0%
I made a couple of small tweaks and and
 
02:09:56.589 --> 02:09:56.599 align:start position:0%
this is where I'm going to ask for your
 
02:10:00.189 --> 02:10:00.199 align:start position:0%
help um Miss Morris somewhere I don't I
 
02:10:02.069 --> 02:10:02.079 align:start position:0%
the Line is now gone so I don't know
 
02:10:04.629 --> 02:10:04.639 align:start position:0%
where it was but there was a line that
 
02:10:09.189 --> 02:10:09.199 align:start position:0%
said we shall not consider a a lack of
 
02:10:11.149 --> 02:10:11.159 align:start position:0%
availability or resources in our
 
02:10:13.390 --> 02:10:13.400 align:start position:0%
decision making and that that always
 
02:10:18.750 --> 02:10:18.760 align:start position:0%
confounded me so so where where in
 
02:10:22.189 --> 02:10:22.199 align:start position:0%
1290 would that ghostline language B if
 
02:10:24.950 --> 02:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
we hadn't eradicated
 
02:10:27.950 --> 02:10:27.960 align:start position:0%
it um there are multiple places but
 
02:10:31.870 --> 02:10:31.880 align:start position:0%
first one is on page one line
 
02:10:34.750 --> 02:10:34.760 align:start position:0%
19 where it says a lack of foster family
 
02:10:36.629 --> 02:10:36.639 align:start position:0%
homes or Community Based resources shall
 
02:10:38.950 --> 02:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
not be it now says shall not be an
 
02:10:41.430 --> 02:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
acceptable primary reason for placement
 
02:10:43.109 --> 02:10:43.119 align:start position:0%
in a residential facility so you fixed
 
02:10:45.790 --> 02:10:45.800 align:start position:0%
it by inserting primary correct all
 
02:10:48.629 --> 02:10:48.639 align:start position:0%
right I I I I can live with that okay
 
02:10:50.270 --> 02:10:50.280 align:start position:0%
okay and then there were two other
 
02:11:00.470 --> 02:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:02.830 --> 02:11:02.840 align:start position:0%
that that's all right I I think you I
 
02:11:05.229 --> 02:11:05.239 align:start position:0%
think you cleaned it up um and then
 
02:11:06.430 --> 02:11:06.440 align:start position:0%
we're going through it with you at the
 
02:11:09.830 --> 02:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
same time so okay what and then what was
 
02:11:12.109 --> 02:11:12.119 align:start position:0%
what was the second thing did it seemed
 
02:11:14.189 --> 02:11:14.199 align:start position:0%
like I had two or three things that we
 
02:11:15.910 --> 02:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
tweaked in
 
02:11:18.910 --> 02:11:18.920 align:start position:0%
here one was a discussion about the
 
02:11:21.430 --> 02:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
twice per year visits one which
 
02:11:23.549 --> 02:11:23.559 align:start position:0%
unannounced you just kind of wanted that
 
02:11:25.549 --> 02:11:25.559 align:start position:0%
reworded so that it didn't I didn't want
 
02:11:27.350 --> 02:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
to change your agreement I just wanted
 
02:11:30.149 --> 02:11:30.159 align:start position:0%
it clean what what what line is that you
 
02:11:32.109 --> 02:11:32.119 align:start position:0%
know that is
 
02:11:37.310 --> 02:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
now page three starting on line
 
02:11:37.320 --> 02:11:40.470 align:start position:0%
now page three starting on line
25

02:11:40.470 --> 02:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:43.910 --> 02:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
okay okay so so what we what what I did
 
02:11:47.350 --> 02:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
in this amendment was um we're at the
 
02:11:49.430 --> 02:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
end of 25 where it says that these
 
02:11:52.950 --> 02:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
visits at least twice per year of which
 
02:11:55.589 --> 02:11:55.599 align:start position:0%
at least one shall be announced
 
02:11:58.790 --> 02:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
previously instead of the words of which
 
02:12:02.350 --> 02:12:02.360 align:start position:0%
it said including and I I just thought
 
02:12:05.790 --> 02:12:05.800 align:start position:0%
the saying of which was more precise in
 
02:12:07.470 --> 02:12:07.480 align:start position:0%
terms of what we were trying to do it
 
02:12:09.709 --> 02:12:09.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't change the number or the thought
 
02:12:11.990 --> 02:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
it just makes it easier for somebody
 
02:12:14.030 --> 02:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
who's never read this before to read it
 
02:12:18.390 --> 02:12:18.400 align:start position:0%
and understand it was was there a third
 
02:12:23.709 --> 02:12:23.719 align:start position:0%
one yes it was regarding um the 5 days
 
02:12:26.990 --> 02:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
provision um so if you look at page six
 
02:12:29.830 --> 02:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
starting on line one as long as a child
 
02:12:31.189 --> 02:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
remains in a residential treatment
 
02:12:32.830 --> 02:12:32.840 align:start position:0%
program the department shall submit
 
02:12:34.669 --> 02:12:34.679 align:start position:0%
evidence to the court and all parties at
 
02:12:36.709 --> 02:12:36.719 align:start position:0%
least five and you wanted to clarify
 
02:12:38.390 --> 02:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
whether that was calendar or business
 
02:12:40.549 --> 02:12:40.559 align:start position:0%
days right and you've clarified it as
 
02:12:43.310 --> 02:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
business and that and that's what you
 
02:12:46.229 --> 02:12:46.239 align:start position:0%
all as you negotiated it had in mind
 
02:12:48.830 --> 02:12:48.840 align:start position:0%
that it was always intended to be five
 
02:12:50.790 --> 02:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
business days and notal I clarified that
 
02:12:52.910 --> 02:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
with I believe that's already in the
 
02:12:55.510 --> 02:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
court rules which is why we hadn't said
 
02:12:57.310 --> 02:12:57.320 align:start position:0%
business specifically but I believe it
 
02:12:59.350 --> 02:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
is business days under the current just
 
02:13:01.950 --> 02:13:01.960 align:start position:0%
okay I I we're writing new law so I just
 
02:13:04.629 --> 02:13:04.639 align:start position:0%
wanted to get it right okay so that was
 
02:13:06.390 --> 02:13:06.400 align:start position:0%
not trying to change policy that was
 
02:13:08.910 --> 02:13:08.920 align:start position:0%
just trying to add clarification I think
 
02:13:11.109 --> 02:13:11.119 align:start position:0%
that was it or was there a fourth there
 
02:13:14.430 --> 02:13:14.440 align:start position:0%
was one more I'm trying to find where it
 
02:13:14.440 --> 02:13:19.510 align:start position:0%
was one more I'm trying to find where it
is

02:13:19.510 --> 02:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:22.069 --> 02:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
now it's regarding
 
02:13:25.270 --> 02:13:25.280 align:start position:0%
the safe place determined by a case
 
02:13:25.280 --> 02:13:26.990 align:start position:0%
the safe place determined by a case
worker

02:13:26.990 --> 02:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
worker
 
02:13:30.109 --> 02:13:30.119 align:start position:0%
um because I wanted it clear that only
 
02:13:35.669 --> 02:13:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:38.589 --> 02:13:38.599 align:start position:0%
decision it's page two line
 
02:13:40.020 --> 02:13:40.030 align:start position:0%
25 page
 
02:13:40.030 --> 02:13:43.149 align:start position:0%
25 page
[Music]

02:13:43.149 --> 02:13:43.159 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:13:46.030 --> 02:13:46.040 align:start position:0%
225 it shall include a private meeting
 
02:13:48.310 --> 02:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
with the child in a safe place is
 
02:13:50.470 --> 02:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
determined by the casew worker the
 
02:13:52.870 --> 02:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
previous itations of this said something
 
02:13:54.790 --> 02:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
to the effect that it should be a safe
 
02:13:57.229 --> 02:13:57.239 align:start position:0%
place as determined by the child and the
 
02:13:59.870 --> 02:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
casew worker and I'm just an old
 
02:14:02.990 --> 02:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
military guy and somebody has to be
 
02:14:04.990 --> 02:14:05.000 align:start position:0%
clear on who has the decision-making
 
02:14:07.589 --> 02:14:07.599 align:start position:0%
Authority now this is also my example of
 
02:14:09.109 --> 02:14:09.119 align:start position:0%
what should not be in law this is way
 
02:14:11.870 --> 02:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
too detailed this should be in a and it
 
02:14:14.390 --> 02:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
already is I was told in a previous
 
02:14:17.229 --> 02:14:17.239 align:start position:0%
meeting that the safe place language was
 
02:14:20.229 --> 02:14:20.239 align:start position:0%
already in policy somewhere and then we
 
02:14:22.310 --> 02:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
were bringing it into the law for some
 
02:14:25.189 --> 02:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
reason and it's just too much so so I'm
 
02:14:28.510 --> 02:14:28.520 align:start position:0%
going to I'm going to be offering 129 is
 
02:14:31.069 --> 02:14:31.079 align:start position:0%
that it are th are those all the changes
 
02:14:33.189 --> 02:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
from basically the Pearson Amendment
 
02:14:33.199 --> 02:14:37.069 align:start position:0%
from basically the Pearson Amendment
Miss

02:14:37.069 --> 02:14:37.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:39.629 --> 02:14:39.639 align:start position:0%
Morris and then obviously the CH big
 
02:14:41.629 --> 02:14:41.639 align:start position:0%
changes are the money we didn't have all
 
02:14:43.350 --> 02:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
the money we didn't have the
 
02:14:47.669 --> 02:14:47.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:50.750 --> 02:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
now yes and then on page three starting
 
02:14:53.229 --> 02:14:53.239 align:start position:0%
on oh not starting on line 32 but at
 
02:14:57.750 --> 02:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
line 32 um this discusses the annual
 
02:15:01.430 --> 02:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
recertification if a facility has been
 
02:15:03.589 --> 02:15:03.599 align:start position:0%
recertified or certified and then a
 
02:15:05.350 --> 02:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
child is removed and then another child
 
02:15:08.229 --> 02:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
isn't placed for at least 120 days after
 
02:15:10.910 --> 02:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
that child was the other child left um
 
02:15:13.030 --> 02:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
we would do another in-person
 
02:15:16.069 --> 02:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
certification visit to since we have not
 
02:15:17.629 --> 02:15:17.639 align:start position:0%
had eyes on that facility in any
 
02:15:21.830 --> 02:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
capacity in the past 120 days all right
 
02:15:25.589 --> 02:15:25.599 align:start position:0%
okay so I I think that drove us through
 
02:15:28.149 --> 02:15:28.159 align:start position:0%
this amendment and and we'll come back
 
02:15:31.229 --> 02:15:31.239 align:start position:0%
and we'll discuss it but I wanted to do
 
02:15:36.629 --> 02:15:36.639 align:start position:0%
a compare and contrast with what I I
 
02:15:40.189 --> 02:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
decided ad hoc after talking to Ms
 
02:15:43.430 --> 02:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
Morris this morning about sort of the
 
02:15:47.390 --> 02:15:47.400 align:start position:0%
final final changes uh to the amendment
 
02:15:49.750 --> 02:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
and and so
 
02:15:55.669 --> 02:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:01.549 --> 02:16:01.559 align:start position:0%
um my attempt to say um that that this
 
02:16:04.870 --> 02:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
policy is not necessarily done the
 
02:16:07.149 --> 02:16:07.159 align:start position:0%
department has already taken a lot of
 
02:16:09.830 --> 02:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
steps towards implementing changes in
 
02:16:12.830 --> 02:16:12.840 align:start position:0%
their policy they've already begun to
 
02:16:15.149 --> 02:16:15.159 align:start position:0%
behave differently they have new
 
02:16:18.109 --> 02:16:18.119 align:start position:0%
management focus on this the likelihood
 
02:16:20.430 --> 02:16:20.440 align:start position:0%
of having a similar problem has been
 
02:16:23.910 --> 02:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
vastly reduced I believe based on the
 
02:16:26.750 --> 02:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
attention that's been paid on this and
 
02:16:30.950 --> 02:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
and so much of what is in the amendment
 
02:16:34.950 --> 02:16:34.960 align:start position:0%
1290 I think is already finding its way
 
02:16:39.230 --> 02:16:39.240 align:start position:0%
into policies without a law um so so
 
02:16:41.190 --> 02:16:41.200 align:start position:0%
rather than us getting into the Weeds on
 
02:16:45.190 --> 02:16:45.200 align:start position:0%
the law what I what I proposed
 
02:16:47.830 --> 02:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
instead is
 
02:16:51.790 --> 02:16:51.800 align:start position:0%
um with the with maintaining
 
02:16:53.830 --> 02:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
the the statement and purpose and the
 
02:16:55.750 --> 02:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
findings to make sure that we all know
 
02:16:58.870 --> 02:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about I I I simply
 
02:17:01.150 --> 02:17:01.160 align:start position:0%
said that we would
 
02:17:04.270 --> 02:17:04.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate uh a million dollars between
 
02:17:07.709 --> 02:17:07.719 align:start position:0%
now and the end of the the budget cycle
 
02:17:09.830 --> 02:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
which is June 30th
 
02:17:12.589 --> 02:17:12.599 align:start position:0%
2025 so that they have the additional
 
02:17:16.110 --> 02:17:16.120 align:start position:0%
resources to do the additional work that
 
02:17:17.549 --> 02:17:17.559 align:start position:0%
that they've already said that they
 
02:17:22.469 --> 02:17:22.479 align:start position:0%
would do in policy and a million
 
02:17:26.709 --> 02:17:26.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:29.790 --> 02:17:29.800 align:start position:0%
million it's it's the small amendment
 
02:17:32.709 --> 02:17:32.719 align:start position:0%
that I'm sorry I made a transition to
 
02:17:36.709 --> 02:17:36.719 align:start position:0%
1291 and and I'm I'm I'm I support 1291
 
02:17:39.429 --> 02:17:39.439 align:start position:0%
as where I'm going with this because I I
 
02:17:42.309 --> 02:17:42.319 align:start position:0%
wanted to get the legislature out of the
 
02:17:45.429 --> 02:17:45.439 align:start position:0%
weeds but I wanted to make sure that the
 
02:17:47.389 --> 02:17:47.399 align:start position:0%
department continued to have the
 
02:17:50.950 --> 02:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
resources to to implement the Improv mov
 
02:17:52.270 --> 02:17:52.280 align:start position:0%
ments and the
 
02:17:55.790 --> 02:17:55.800 align:start position:0%
change and and I and I'm confident in
 
02:17:59.389 --> 02:17:59.399 align:start position:0%
the department to do that um but they
 
02:18:01.110 --> 02:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
you know they're going to need resources
 
02:18:04.150 --> 02:18:04.160 align:start position:0%
because they do intend to to travel more
 
02:18:07.509 --> 02:18:07.519 align:start position:0%
frequently um and spend more money on uh
 
02:18:10.150 --> 02:18:10.160 align:start position:0%
the documentation necessary for the
 
02:18:12.750 --> 02:18:12.760 align:start position:0%
courts to adjudicate each case properly
 
02:18:17.549 --> 02:18:17.559 align:start position:0%
so so so they've already accepted more
 
02:18:22.270 --> 02:18:22.280 align:start position:0%
workload this million dollars is um is
 
02:18:25.349 --> 02:18:25.359 align:start position:0%
is is a commitment from the legislature
 
02:18:28.589 --> 02:18:28.599 align:start position:0%
to say recognizing that there's new work
 
02:18:31.309 --> 02:18:31.319 align:start position:0%
that flowed out of the failures in
 
02:18:33.990 --> 02:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
Tennessee that it's trying to be
 
02:18:36.429 --> 02:18:36.439 align:start position:0%
addressed by the department and and and
 
02:18:39.389 --> 02:18:39.399 align:start position:0%
here some resources that are intended to
 
02:18:42.230 --> 02:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
facilitate those improvements that
 
02:18:46.150 --> 02:18:46.160 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm trying to say with
 
02:18:48.190 --> 02:18:48.200 align:start position:0%
1291 and and
 
02:18:52.030 --> 02:18:52.040 align:start position:0%
so with with that I'm I'm offering them
 
02:18:54.669 --> 02:18:54.679 align:start position:0%
both up for discussion kind of
 
02:18:57.070 --> 02:18:57.080 align:start position:0%
simultaneously so that people can ask
 
02:18:59.589 --> 02:18:59.599 align:start position:0%
questions of what I what what the heck I
 
02:19:01.509 --> 02:19:01.519 align:start position:0%
thought I was doing here so
 
02:19:01.519 --> 02:19:03.830 align:start position:0%
thought I was doing here so
representative

02:19:03.830 --> 02:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:19:06.030 --> 02:19:06.040 align:start position:0%
hle thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:19:09.549 --> 02:19:09.559 align:start position:0%
your work in this on page four of
 
02:19:09.559 --> 02:19:13.750 align:start position:0%
your work in this on page four of
amendment

02:19:13.750 --> 02:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:18.950 --> 02:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
11909 um line seven there's ran numeral
 
02:19:20.870 --> 02:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
six that talks about any placement of a
 
02:19:22.669 --> 02:19:22.679 align:start position:0%
child outside New England shall require
 
02:19:24.750 --> 02:19:24.760 align:start position:0%
the approval of the dcyf director prior
 
02:19:27.389 --> 02:19:27.399 align:start position:0%
to placement I don't see that copied
 
02:19:31.230 --> 02:19:31.240 align:start position:0%
forward in 1291 am I missing it no I I
 
02:19:33.469 --> 02:19:33.479 align:start position:0%
don't think you're missing it um no that
 
02:19:36.309 --> 02:19:36.319 align:start position:0%
was not copied but but that but that to
 
02:19:40.030 --> 02:19:40.040 align:start position:0%
me can be done in policy they they they
 
02:19:43.150 --> 02:19:43.160 align:start position:0%
can set that up without it being in law
 
02:19:45.389 --> 02:19:45.399 align:start position:0%
so so what I wanted to do was to make
 
02:19:46.629 --> 02:19:46.639 align:start position:0%
sure that with
 
02:19:50.070 --> 02:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
1291 that I Advanced a Germaine
 
02:19:50.080 --> 02:19:51.150 align:start position:0%
1291 that I Advanced a Germaine
Amendment

02:19:51.150 --> 02:19:51.160 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
02:19:53.710 --> 02:19:53.720 align:start position:0%
you know because it's clearly within the
 
02:19:55.790 --> 02:19:55.800 align:start position:0%
scope of what we've been talking about
 
02:19:59.429 --> 02:19:59.439 align:start position:0%
but I didn't want to replicate all of
 
02:20:02.190 --> 02:20:02.200 align:start position:0%
the policy decisions that that are in
 
02:20:06.990 --> 02:20:07.000 align:start position:0%
1290 yes sir I I believe this that one
 
02:20:10.070 --> 02:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
section might be valuable in statute and
 
02:20:11.870 --> 02:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
the reason I say that is it directly
 
02:20:14.429 --> 02:20:14.439 align:start position:0%
impacts the families whose children are
 
02:20:17.150 --> 02:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
in these centers and their ability to
 
02:20:19.190 --> 02:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
travel to see them routinely so there's
 
02:20:21.870 --> 02:20:21.880 align:start position:0%
a big difference between a road trip to
 
02:20:25.190 --> 02:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
Maine or to Massachusetts or Vermont or
 
02:20:29.190 --> 02:20:29.200 align:start position:0%
even I don't know Connecticut versus um
 
02:20:33.389 --> 02:20:33.399 align:start position:0%
Tennessee and I personally I would argue
 
02:20:35.790 --> 02:20:35.800 align:start position:0%
that that Roman numeral that sub small
 
02:20:37.389 --> 02:20:37.399 align:start position:0%
subsection would be something that would
 
02:20:41.190 --> 02:20:41.200 align:start position:0%
be line S through nine yes
 
02:20:44.590 --> 02:20:44.600 align:start position:0%
sir I I I don't I don't see a problem
 
02:20:46.309 --> 02:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
with that other than opening the
 
02:20:49.469 --> 02:20:49.479 align:start position:0%
temptation to put everything back into
 
02:20:51.790 --> 02:20:51.800 align:start position:0%
1291 which which sort of defeats the
 
02:20:55.349 --> 02:20:55.359 align:start position:0%
purpose but I see your point at making a
 
02:20:57.349 --> 02:20:57.359 align:start position:0%
distinction do you have a comment on
 
02:20:59.710 --> 02:20:59.720 align:start position:0%
that Miss W yes just that the difference
 
02:21:04.710 --> 02:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
was in 1290 that is in the policy piece
 
02:21:07.429 --> 02:21:07.439 align:start position:0%
where in 1291 that's just in the purpose
 
02:21:07.439 --> 02:21:08.230 align:start position:0%
where in 1291 that's just in the purpose
and

02:21:08.230 --> 02:21:08.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:21:11.150 --> 02:21:11.160 align:start position:0%
findings so it would be read addding
 
02:21:15.790 --> 02:21:15.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:18.389 --> 02:21:18.399 align:start position:0%
it and we're not done with this by the
 
02:21:21.349 --> 02:21:21.359 align:start position:0%
way even even if we pass it and nobody's
 
02:21:24.469 --> 02:21:24.479 align:start position:0%
happy with 1291 we're we're not done
 
02:21:27.150 --> 02:21:27.160 align:start position:0%
because uh the Senate Bill
 
02:21:32.070 --> 02:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
4177 is a companion bill uh and you know
 
02:21:35.309 --> 02:21:35.319 align:start position:0%
some form of that is most likely to pass
 
02:21:38.030 --> 02:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
and that's going to come back over here
 
02:21:40.750 --> 02:21:40.760 align:start position:0%
uh and so in in about two months we're
 
02:21:42.870 --> 02:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
going to be having the same conversation
 
02:21:44.910 --> 02:21:44.920 align:start position:0%
with more information and more people in
 
02:21:48.190 --> 02:21:48.200 align:start position:0%
the loop so I I don't I don't see what
 
02:21:51.150 --> 02:21:51.160 align:start position:0%
we're doing today as being uh the last
 
02:21:53.270 --> 02:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
step I just I just see it as being the
 
02:21:56.750 --> 02:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
next step um representative
 
02:21:58.990 --> 02:21:59.000 align:start position:0%
walner thank
 
02:22:02.550 --> 02:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
you so as I look at
 
02:22:02.560 --> 02:22:04.750 align:start position:0%
you so as I look at
1291

02:22:04.750 --> 02:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
1291
 
02:22:07.870 --> 02:22:07.880 align:start position:0%
um what it makes me think is that what
 
02:22:10.910 --> 02:22:10.920 align:start position:0%
we have what this really is doing is
 
02:22:13.550 --> 02:22:13.560 align:start position:0%
taking all the work
 
02:22:18.309 --> 02:22:18.319 align:start position:0%
that chairman Pearson did in proposing
 
02:22:20.550 --> 02:22:20.560 align:start position:0%
the bill and all the work of the
 
02:22:23.030 --> 02:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
children and family law committee and
 
02:22:26.429 --> 02:22:26.439 align:start position:0%
basically just getting rid of it and
 
02:22:29.590 --> 02:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
replacing it with a million dollar and
 
02:22:32.030 --> 02:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
basically saying here's a million
 
02:22:34.790 --> 02:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
dollars we hope you'll do the right
 
02:22:36.710 --> 02:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
thing and the
 
02:22:41.349 --> 02:22:41.359 align:start position:0%
legislature is done with it um I think
 
02:22:44.710 --> 02:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
that we're faced with a really serious
 
02:22:48.830 --> 02:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
situation and it will be somewhat
 
02:22:50.870 --> 02:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
helpful won't be the answer answer to
 
02:22:52.510 --> 02:22:52.520 align:start position:0%
the problem but it'll be somewhat
 
02:22:55.110 --> 02:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
helpful for the public and for people to
 
02:22:57.150 --> 02:22:57.160 align:start position:0%
see that the legislature is taking it
 
02:23:01.230 --> 02:23:01.240 align:start position:0%
seriously and that we're where we are
 
02:23:04.309 --> 02:23:04.319 align:start position:0%
going to pass a piece of legislation
 
02:23:06.070 --> 02:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
that will really outline for the
 
02:23:11.469 --> 02:23:11.479 align:start position:0%
Department what is expected of them
 
02:23:18.550 --> 02:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
and 1291 leaves it all up to the
 
02:23:21.710 --> 02:23:21.720 align:start position:0%
department 1290
 
02:23:25.590 --> 02:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
is a partnership between the department
 
02:23:29.510 --> 02:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
the legislature the child advocate and
 
02:23:31.990 --> 02:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
the child advocate and the department
 
02:23:34.670 --> 02:23:34.680 align:start position:0%
have worked hard to come up with
 
02:23:38.950 --> 02:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
something they can both agree on and
 
02:23:41.309 --> 02:23:41.319 align:start position:0%
um I just feel
 
02:23:44.870 --> 02:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
that this is not this is not the way
 
02:23:47.830 --> 02:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
that finance committee should be moving
 
02:23:50.389 --> 02:23:50.399 align:start position:0%
forward it doesn't feel fiscally respons
 
02:23:52.630 --> 02:23:52.640 align:start position:0%
responsible to me to be just saying to
 
02:23:54.429 --> 02:23:54.439 align:start position:0%
the department here's a million dollars
 
02:23:57.469 --> 02:23:57.479 align:start position:0%
we hope you'll do the right thing um I'm
 
02:23:59.830 --> 02:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
really sort of
 
02:23:59.840 --> 02:24:01.349 align:start position:0%
really sort of
surprised

02:24:01.349 --> 02:24:01.359 align:start position:0%
surprised
 
02:24:04.110 --> 02:24:04.120 align:start position:0%
that this kind of a suggestion would
 
02:24:05.670 --> 02:24:05.680 align:start position:0%
come out of the finance committee
 
02:24:08.510 --> 02:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
because it's it's sort of so unlike the
 
02:24:11.349 --> 02:24:11.359 align:start position:0%
finance committee to uh just write a
 
02:24:13.870 --> 02:24:13.880 align:start position:0%
blank check and hope that somebody will
 
02:24:18.990 --> 02:24:19.000 align:start position:0%
do the right thing so um from that I uh
 
02:24:21.150 --> 02:24:21.160 align:start position:0%
do not feel comfortable with
 
02:24:24.150 --> 02:24:24.160 align:start position:0%
1291 may I may I comment and ask your
 
02:24:27.790 --> 02:24:27.800 align:start position:0%
question about that um the my comment is
 
02:24:30.230 --> 02:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
uh I think arguably it's more fiscally
 
02:24:32.150 --> 02:24:32.160 align:start position:0%
responsible because we're talking about
 
02:24:34.990 --> 02:24:35.000 align:start position:0%
a million dollars instead of you know at
 
02:24:39.590 --> 02:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
least 15 new FTS and6 s million so in
 
02:24:42.870 --> 02:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
terms of which one uh protects the
 
02:24:46.190 --> 02:24:46.200 align:start position:0%
taxpayers more uh I I would I would say
 
02:24:49.389 --> 02:24:49.399 align:start position:0%
it's 12291 I don't really think that you
 
02:24:52.950 --> 02:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
know just the number that's just math um
 
02:24:56.429 --> 02:24:56.439 align:start position:0%
um but to you know to your other point
 
02:24:59.150 --> 02:24:59.160 align:start position:0%
um we're not the final word on this
 
02:25:01.670 --> 02:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
we're we the Senate bill is going to be
 
02:25:04.150 --> 02:25:04.160 align:start position:0%
given us another opportunity in a couple
 
02:25:07.590 --> 02:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
of months to come back to this and there
 
02:25:11.030 --> 02:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
were still some minor policy rubs I
 
02:25:13.870 --> 02:25:13.880 align:start position:0%
think between OCA and the I'm still
 
02:25:16.110 --> 02:25:16.120 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable that the Judiciary has
 
02:25:19.230 --> 02:25:19.240 align:start position:0%
actually been fully in involved uh
 
02:25:23.670 --> 02:25:23.680 align:start position:0%
division one hasn't been involved um so
 
02:25:27.030 --> 02:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
um I I I would like to keep the process
 
02:25:28.550 --> 02:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
moving I would like to put our
 
02:25:31.710 --> 02:25:31.720 align:start position:0%
fingerprints on it to say that yes it's
 
02:25:34.070 --> 02:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
a legitimate real problem for which we
 
02:25:35.990 --> 02:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
want the department to take the
 
02:25:38.510 --> 02:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
seriously all indications have been that
 
02:25:41.950 --> 02:25:41.960 align:start position:0%
the department has taken it seriously so
 
02:25:43.870 --> 02:25:43.880 align:start position:0%
so so we just have a different point of
 
02:25:46.750 --> 02:25:46.760 align:start position:0%
view on that and that's okay but the but
 
02:25:48.590 --> 02:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
here let me ask you a question now
 
02:25:50.710 --> 02:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
though you've you've been doing this
 
02:25:53.190 --> 02:25:53.200 align:start position:0%
legislative work longer than I have and
 
02:25:59.150 --> 02:25:59.160 align:start position:0%
so from a simply a the perspective of
 
02:26:04.870 --> 02:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
good sound discipline statutory
 
02:26:07.830 --> 02:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
design do you think that it's
 
02:26:12.230 --> 02:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate to put a lot of policy into
 
02:26:15.950 --> 02:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
our statutes policies that might be good
 
02:26:18.710 --> 02:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
but maybe more
 
02:26:21.190 --> 02:26:21.200 align:start position:0%
appropriately uh put in the rules are
 
02:26:23.790 --> 02:26:23.800 align:start position:0%
put into the subsequent departmental
 
02:26:27.110 --> 02:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
policy I this is sort of a philosophical
 
02:26:31.150 --> 02:26:31.160 align:start position:0%
question on statutory design because
 
02:26:35.510 --> 02:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
this came to us I think with sort of
 
02:26:38.910 --> 02:26:38.920 align:start position:0%
lacking the discipline to to to to stick
 
02:26:40.950 --> 02:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
to what should be in a statute versus
 
02:26:47.070 --> 02:26:47.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:49.870 --> 02:26:49.880 align:start position:0%
policy I think the situation is such
 
02:26:51.830 --> 02:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
that it it's going to be really
 
02:26:54.429 --> 02:26:54.439 align:start position:0%
important that the
 
02:26:54.439 --> 02:26:56.309 align:start position:0%
important that the
public

02:26:56.309 --> 02:26:56.319 align:start position:0%
public
 
02:26:58.870 --> 02:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
families other
 
02:27:02.110 --> 02:27:02.120 align:start position:0%
agencies outside of state government
 
02:27:05.710 --> 02:27:05.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:09.469 --> 02:27:09.479 align:start position:0%
to state law to see what is required of
 
02:27:11.230 --> 02:27:11.240 align:start position:0%
the department when it comes to these
 
02:27:14.110 --> 02:27:14.120 align:start position:0%
outof State placements and the
 
02:27:17.990 --> 02:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
placements that we make um within state
 
02:27:21.670 --> 02:27:21.680 align:start position:0%
within the state um this is
 
02:27:24.870 --> 02:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
probably at least to me this is probably
 
02:27:26.750 --> 02:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
one of the most serious
 
02:27:30.950 --> 02:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
things the state does when it takes
 
02:27:33.030 --> 02:27:33.040 align:start position:0%
custody of a
 
02:27:38.469 --> 02:27:38.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:42.110 --> 02:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
placement it's devastating for the child
 
02:27:44.910 --> 02:27:44.920 align:start position:0%
for the families and it's it's one of
 
02:27:47.110 --> 02:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
the most Ser I it's just one of the most
 
02:27:54.309 --> 02:27:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:57.550 --> 02:27:57.560 align:start position:0%
well-defined mechanisms within state law
 
02:28:00.510 --> 02:28:00.520 align:start position:0%
on how that is going to happen and what
 
02:28:03.630 --> 02:28:03.640 align:start position:0%
the oversight of that is I think is one
 
02:28:06.150 --> 02:28:06.160 align:start position:0%
of the areas that is
 
02:28:10.710 --> 02:28:10.720 align:start position:0%
that it is good for us to be really um
 
02:28:13.190 --> 02:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
outlining what it is and I I think that
 
02:28:17.190 --> 02:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
that's why the children and family law
 
02:28:21.110 --> 02:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
committee sent us to us with this kind
 
02:28:25.510 --> 02:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
of a detailed law um and like I said I I
 
02:28:26.990 --> 02:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
just think this is probably one of the
 
02:28:28.950 --> 02:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
most serious things we do as state
 
02:28:32.510 --> 02:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
government to um Place children out of
 
02:28:35.110 --> 02:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
their own home and we should be taking
 
02:28:37.510 --> 02:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
it very seriously and we should have it
 
02:28:41.750 --> 02:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
within law what our what is our
 
02:28:43.990 --> 02:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility to these children to
 
02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.030 align:start position:0%
responsibility to these children to
these

02:28:46.030 --> 02:28:46.040 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:28:48.389 --> 02:28:48.399 align:start position:0%
families you you you'll you might be
 
02:28:50.389 --> 02:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
surprised I don't disagree with any you
 
02:28:53.110 --> 02:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
just said I I I just would come back to
 
02:28:57.389 --> 02:28:57.399 align:start position:0%
the idea that this is a next step I I we
 
02:29:00.590 --> 02:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
have been scrambling to get 1573 right
 
02:29:02.510 --> 02:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
I'm still not comfortable that we've got
 
02:29:05.230 --> 02:29:05.240 align:start position:0%
it right but we need to do something and
 
02:29:07.230 --> 02:29:07.240 align:start position:0%
I want to I want to keep everyone moving
 
02:29:10.269 --> 02:29:10.279 align:start position:0%
forward knowing that in two months we're
 
02:29:12.630 --> 02:29:12.640 align:start position:0%
going to be right back at it with with s
 
02:29:16.910 --> 02:29:16.920 align:start position:0%
sp4 417 so so so I sort of look at it
 
02:29:20.269 --> 02:29:20.279 align:start position:0%
that way now now miss Morris the item
 
02:29:23.349 --> 02:29:23.359 align:start position:0%
that you've been agreeing to with OCA
 
02:29:25.510 --> 02:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
that have found its way into this
 
02:29:28.269 --> 02:29:28.279 align:start position:0%
amendment uh
 
02:29:30.990 --> 02:29:31.000 align:start position:0%
1290 could you just tell us in your own
 
02:29:33.590 --> 02:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
words the extent to which you think
 
02:29:36.990 --> 02:29:37.000 align:start position:0%
those changes have been uh implemented
 
02:29:39.870 --> 02:29:39.880 align:start position:0%
in practice and in policy in the
 
02:29:43.150 --> 02:29:43.160 align:start position:0%
department already that is where I will
 
02:29:44.469 --> 02:29:44.479 align:start position:0%
have to bring in my subject matter
 
02:29:46.910 --> 02:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
experts because I am not on the ground I
 
02:29:48.950 --> 02:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
can't tell you what policies have been
 
02:29:50.550 --> 02:29:50.560 align:start position:0%
changed I do know
 
02:29:52.550 --> 02:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
and I believe it was prior to that but
 
02:29:56.150 --> 02:29:56.160 align:start position:0%
um our staff bcbh as well as dcyf they
 
02:29:59.070 --> 02:29:59.080 align:start position:0%
meet with the OCA on a weekly basis
 
02:30:02.750 --> 02:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
monthly monthly um to discuss not just
 
02:30:05.790 --> 02:30:05.800 align:start position:0%
this but overall programmatic changes um
 
02:30:08.070 --> 02:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
but I can bring up Jeff fler who is our
 
02:30:10.510 --> 02:30:10.520 align:start position:0%
director of dcyf to speak to some of
 
02:30:13.950 --> 02:30:13.960 align:start position:0%
those changes that's great
 
02:30:16.309 --> 02:30:16.319 align:start position:0%
okay and while we're waiting for him if
 
02:30:18.910 --> 02:30:18.920 align:start position:0%
I may sir um from the office of child
 
02:30:22.110 --> 02:30:22.120 align:start position:0%
Advocates standpoint Point while we have
 
02:30:25.070 --> 02:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
heard the agency agree with us in theory
 
02:30:27.710 --> 02:30:27.720 align:start position:0%
and in fact this bill is still largely
 
02:30:31.269 --> 02:30:31.279 align:start position:0%
as drafted by the OCA with input from
 
02:30:33.070 --> 02:30:33.080 align:start position:0%
Marissa hen the associate commissioner
 
02:30:35.309 --> 02:30:35.319 align:start position:0%
Jeff fler and katcha Fox at a pretty
 
02:30:38.070 --> 02:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
high level Marissa hen testified in
 
02:30:39.710 --> 02:30:39.720 align:start position:0%
children and family law just a couple
 
02:30:41.910 --> 02:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
months ago that the department was in
 
02:30:44.550 --> 02:30:44.560 align:start position:0%
agreement with this entire Bill other
 
02:30:46.389 --> 02:30:46.399 align:start position:0%
than the word Contracting which was
 
02:30:49.190 --> 02:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
removed at this juncture while we've
 
02:30:51.309 --> 02:30:51.319 align:start position:0%
heard their making changes we have
 
02:30:51.319 --> 02:30:52.830 align:start position:0%
heard their making changes we have
requested

02:30:52.830 --> 02:30:52.840 align:start position:0%
requested
 
02:30:55.790 --> 02:30:55.800 align:start position:0%
repeatedly documentation of what is
 
02:30:59.030 --> 02:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
being done on the ground and have not
 
02:31:03.150 --> 02:31:03.160 align:start position:0%
received a single thing so while I
 
02:31:04.950 --> 02:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate that we're being told it's
 
02:31:06.590 --> 02:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
being done they're saying they're
 
02:31:09.070 --> 02:31:09.080 align:start position:0%
sending people we say okay can we please
 
02:31:11.150 --> 02:31:11.160 align:start position:0%
see the site report from a visit that
 
02:31:13.750 --> 02:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
happened in August we still haven't seen
 
02:31:17.030 --> 02:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
it it's almost April
 
02:31:19.590 --> 02:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
so we are having a hard time endorsing
 
02:31:21.190 --> 02:31:21.200 align:start position:0%
the fact that no law needs to be made
 
02:31:22.710 --> 02:31:22.720 align:start position:0%
right now because they're already doing
 
02:31:24.630 --> 02:31:24.640 align:start position:0%
everything apparently with no additional
 
02:31:28.590 --> 02:31:28.600 align:start position:0%
funds as well it just we have not seen
 
02:31:30.630 --> 02:31:30.640 align:start position:0%
the evidence of that which is troubling
 
02:31:32.590 --> 02:31:32.600 align:start position:0%
since under statute we're required to
 
02:31:35.030 --> 02:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
get all of that already I I think that's
 
02:31:37.269 --> 02:31:37.279 align:start position:0%
a fair observation thank you for adding
 
02:31:44.230 --> 02:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:47.830 --> 02:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
to yeah Jeff fler director
 
02:31:50.110 --> 02:31:50.120 align:start position:0%
DCF yeah I think there's no question
 
02:31:52.710 --> 02:31:52.720 align:start position:0%
that um OCA and DCF have been working
 
02:31:54.389 --> 02:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
really well together to come up with
 
02:31:58.190 --> 02:31:58.200 align:start position:0%
this legislation um we agree like uh
 
02:32:00.870 --> 02:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
99% um worked very hard to compromise
 
02:32:03.630 --> 02:32:03.640 align:start position:0%
and to really refine the the bill and I
 
02:32:04.790 --> 02:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
think it's a good bill I think it's a
 
02:32:09.030 --> 02:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
needed bill um yes we are doing a lot of
 
02:32:11.190 --> 02:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
things right now to to push us forward
 
02:32:13.950 --> 02:32:13.960 align:start position:0%
even before this was brought up as a as
 
02:32:17.190 --> 02:32:17.200 align:start position:0%
a bill as imagined as a bill uh when we
 
02:32:18.750 --> 02:32:18.760 align:start position:0%
hit the ground I hit the ground in
 
02:32:21.309 --> 02:32:21.319 align:start position:0%
August that uh this has been a primary
 
02:32:23.349 --> 02:32:23.359 align:start position:0%
objective to keep bring kids back home
 
02:32:25.910 --> 02:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
from out of region out of state and
 
02:32:26.790 --> 02:32:26.800 align:start position:0%
really make New Hampshire
 
02:32:29.349 --> 02:32:29.359 align:start position:0%
self-sufficient so we can serve the most
 
02:32:31.590 --> 02:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
needy kids right here at home so that's
 
02:32:33.510 --> 02:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
been the bulk of our work the bulk of my
 
02:32:36.950 --> 02:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
work uh here um in New Hampshire and
 
02:32:39.110 --> 02:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
continue want to continue to do that I
 
02:32:40.590 --> 02:32:40.600 align:start position:0%
think legislation is good though as
 
02:32:40.600 --> 02:32:41.630 align:start position:0%
think legislation is good though as
leadership

02:32:41.630 --> 02:32:41.640 align:start position:0%
leadership
 
02:32:44.830 --> 02:32:44.840 align:start position:0%
changes um you know philosophies change
 
02:32:47.230 --> 02:32:47.240 align:start position:0%
so I think that uh having good
 
02:32:49.990 --> 02:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
legislation um uh really helps the the
 
02:32:52.030 --> 02:32:52.040 align:start position:0%
continuity um from commissioner to
 
02:32:53.910 --> 02:32:53.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner from director to director
 
02:32:57.870 --> 02:32:57.880 align:start position:0%
etc etc um we're committed to everything
 
02:33:00.349 --> 02:33:00.359 align:start position:0%
we put into the to the bill up until
 
02:33:02.910 --> 02:33:02.920 align:start position:0%
this amendment um as far as visits about
 
02:33:02.920 --> 02:33:03.670 align:start position:0%
this amendment um as far as visits about
his

02:33:03.670 --> 02:33:03.680 align:start position:0%
his
 
02:33:05.309 --> 02:33:05.319 align:start position:0%
certification um it's really the
 
02:33:06.710 --> 02:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
question of to getting the resources to
 
02:33:08.710 --> 02:33:08.720 align:start position:0%
do that I think it's a great bill I
 
02:33:11.670 --> 02:33:11.680 align:start position:0%
think there's a 99% agreement maybe 100%
 
02:33:14.269 --> 02:33:14.279 align:start position:0%
agreement um and it's just a matter of
 
02:33:17.670 --> 02:33:17.680 align:start position:0%
the resources to do the job well so uh
 
02:33:19.070 --> 02:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
that's sort of the perspective that that
 
02:33:21.150 --> 02:33:21.160 align:start position:0%
I can bring
 
02:33:23.190 --> 02:33:23.200 align:start position:0%
did you hear the specific question I
 
02:33:26.990 --> 02:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
made of Ms Morris to tell me of the of
 
02:33:30.550 --> 02:33:30.560 align:start position:0%
the policy issues that are in
 
02:33:33.190 --> 02:33:33.200 align:start position:0%
1290 to what extent have they already
 
02:33:35.630 --> 02:33:35.640 align:start position:0%
been implemented by the department and
 
02:33:38.269 --> 02:33:38.279 align:start position:0%
are maybe awaiting resources but from a
 
02:33:41.590 --> 02:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
policy perspective you intend to have
 
02:33:44.550 --> 02:33:44.560 align:start position:0%
the department doing anyways yeah I
 
02:33:46.910 --> 02:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
think some just the major points is
 
02:33:48.790 --> 02:33:48.800 align:start position:0%
really visiting and monitoring the at
 
02:33:51.070 --> 02:33:51.080 align:start position:0%
home placements the res IAL facilities
 
02:33:52.950 --> 02:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
so we have already been doing from the
 
02:33:55.469 --> 02:33:55.479 align:start position:0%
DCF perspective we've been doing monthly
 
02:33:58.389 --> 02:33:58.399 align:start position:0%
visits for a very long time that will
 
02:34:01.990 --> 02:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
continue it will be enhanced um uh but
 
02:34:04.550 --> 02:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
to today we send out we have 300 kids in
 
02:34:07.030 --> 02:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
residential placement
 
02:34:09.110 --> 02:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
approximately uh every one of those kids
 
02:34:12.429 --> 02:34:12.439 align:start position:0%
gets a visit every month from a DCF
 
02:34:15.269 --> 02:34:15.279 align:start position:0%
worker or juvenile probation officer
 
02:34:18.389 --> 02:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
that's 3,000 visits a year we've been
 
02:34:20.590 --> 02:34:20.600 align:start position:0%
doing that um we've been doing that
 
02:34:23.590 --> 02:34:23.600 align:start position:0%
without a lot of cash to do it um travel
 
02:34:27.790 --> 02:34:27.800 align:start position:0%
has gone up um uh food hotels Airline
 
02:34:30.630 --> 02:34:30.640 align:start position:0%
Etc but we have been doing that um and
 
02:34:32.550 --> 02:34:32.560 align:start position:0%
that will continue I think it's very
 
02:34:35.150 --> 02:34:35.160 align:start position:0%
very important kids need to be monitored
 
02:34:37.030 --> 02:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
just met last night with our youth
 
02:34:38.950 --> 02:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board these are about a dozen
 
02:34:41.269 --> 02:34:41.279 align:start position:0%
kids all as many are in still in
 
02:34:43.150 --> 02:34:43.160 align:start position:0%
residential needing and some have been
 
02:34:45.150 --> 02:34:45.160 align:start position:0%
there before so so let me ask you the
 
02:34:47.870 --> 02:34:47.880 align:start position:0%
same question but from the other
 
02:34:50.550 --> 02:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
direction what is in
 
02:34:53.389 --> 02:34:53.399 align:start position:0%
1290 or you could just refer back to the
 
02:34:55.030 --> 02:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
Pearson Amendment since you've had more
 
02:34:57.550 --> 02:34:57.560 align:start position:0%
time to look at that what what is it in
 
02:35:00.910 --> 02:35:00.920 align:start position:0%
there that you've not
 
02:35:00.920 --> 02:35:03.269 align:start position:0%
there that you've not
done

02:35:03.269 --> 02:35:03.279 align:start position:0%
done
 
02:35:06.590 --> 02:35:06.600 align:start position:0%
um that's in the the Pearson Amendment
 
02:35:08.750 --> 02:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
uh I don't know I'd have to
 
02:35:14.590 --> 02:35:14.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:17.510 --> 02:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
um this is a uh not only talks about
 
02:35:20.550 --> 02:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
dcyf what we'll do but also BC BH does
 
02:35:22.710 --> 02:35:22.720 align:start position:0%
the the actually residential
 
02:35:26.190 --> 02:35:26.200 align:start position:0%
certifications and I think um so you may
 
02:35:29.429 --> 02:35:29.439 align:start position:0%
want to hear from them but uh is that is
 
02:35:31.950 --> 02:35:31.960 align:start position:0%
that Miss Fox is that she can speak to
 
02:35:35.349 --> 02:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
that I I hate to put you on the spot um
 
02:35:38.070 --> 02:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
if you if you don't feel like you've had
 
02:35:40.750 --> 02:35:40.760 align:start position:0%
time to answer the
 
02:35:43.429 --> 02:35:43.439 align:start position:0%
question that never stops
 
02:35:46.429 --> 02:35:46.439 align:start position:0%
me um I'm cuttier Fox director of the
 
02:35:48.070 --> 02:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
division for Behavioral Health which
 
02:35:50.349 --> 02:35:50.359 align:start position:0%
oversees the Bureau of
 
02:35:53.230 --> 02:35:53.240 align:start position:0%
yeah sure I'm Kaa Fox I'm the director
 
02:35:54.870 --> 02:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
of the division for Behavioral Health
 
02:35:57.590 --> 02:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
which oversees the Bureau of children's
 
02:35:59.870 --> 02:35:59.880 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health I did not get the
 
02:36:01.950 --> 02:36:01.960 align:start position:0%
amendment because I was out of the room
 
02:36:03.670 --> 02:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
when it was handed out so I'm going to
 
02:36:06.269 --> 02:36:06.279 align:start position:0%
just do this on the fly but I will tell
 
02:36:09.630 --> 02:36:09.640 align:start position:0%
you that what came to light during um
 
02:36:11.790 --> 02:36:11.800 align:start position:0%
August with the blood so so you did see
 
02:36:14.870 --> 02:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
the Pearson Amendment though from last
 
02:36:18.429 --> 02:36:18.439 align:start position:0%
Monday yes so so for the purpose of the
 
02:36:20.510 --> 02:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
the question let's just sck to that and
 
02:36:22.670 --> 02:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
let's keep it short if we
 
02:36:28.070 --> 02:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
can the um Bureau of um Behavioral
 
02:36:31.670 --> 02:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
Health has children's Behavioral Health
 
02:36:34.830 --> 02:36:34.840 align:start position:0%
has been doing onsite
 
02:36:38.110 --> 02:36:38.120 align:start position:0%
certification so what's changed and what
 
02:36:40.510 --> 02:36:40.520 align:start position:0%
um is different and what's included in
 
02:36:44.630 --> 02:36:44.640 align:start position:0%
that we now are conducting those Insight
 
02:36:46.870 --> 02:36:46.880 align:start position:0%
I mean on-site um certification
 
02:36:50.110 --> 02:36:50.120 align:start position:0%
processes before a child is placed in
 
02:36:51.550 --> 02:36:51.560 align:start position:0%
that residential
 
02:36:54.630 --> 02:36:54.640 align:start position:0%
setting so so my takeaway from that is
 
02:36:56.429 --> 02:36:56.439 align:start position:0%
that the department has already
 
02:36:58.790 --> 02:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
implemented and it intends to continue
 
02:37:01.990 --> 02:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
to maintain implementation of the
 
02:37:03.910 --> 02:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
certification requirements spelled out
 
02:37:08.190 --> 02:37:08.200 align:start position:0%
in the Pearson Amendment yes okay are
 
02:37:10.469 --> 02:37:10.479 align:start position:0%
are there other questions representative
 
02:37:15.150 --> 02:37:15.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:18.150 --> 02:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
on yeah it's quite a few
 
02:37:21.630 --> 02:37:21.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:23.630 --> 02:37:23.640 align:start position:0%
the first thing I notic so I I did get
 
02:37:25.429 --> 02:37:25.439 align:start position:0%
the amendment last night and and went
 
02:37:27.630 --> 02:37:27.640 align:start position:0%
through the whole thing and marked it up
 
02:37:29.670 --> 02:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
compared to the bill is passed by the
 
02:37:32.349 --> 02:37:32.359 align:start position:0%
house and there are a lot of changes
 
02:37:35.230 --> 02:37:35.240 align:start position:0%
that um there are a lot of changes
 
02:37:37.349 --> 02:37:37.359 align:start position:0%
basically it's not just the down the at
 
02:37:39.269 --> 02:37:39.279 align:start position:0%
the back end but the first thing I note
 
02:37:41.230 --> 02:37:41.240 align:start position:0%
that's missing is the thing we discussed
 
02:37:43.269 --> 02:37:43.279 align:start position:0%
I think at our last meeting while there
 
02:37:45.269 --> 02:37:45.279 align:start position:0%
are numbers in here down towards the end
 
02:37:47.349 --> 02:37:47.359 align:start position:0%
in terms of Appropriations I don't see
 
02:37:53.150 --> 02:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
the overall cost yet for FY uh 25 26 27
 
02:37:56.670 --> 02:37:56.680 align:start position:0%
so it' be useful to have that and the
 
02:37:58.870 --> 02:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
other thing that I'm still not clear on
 
02:38:01.630 --> 02:38:01.640 align:start position:0%
is so this was precipitated by a single
 
02:38:04.429 --> 02:38:04.439 align:start position:0%
event which was to what I've understand
 
02:38:08.230 --> 02:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
and what I've heard um a big mistake was
 
02:38:11.030 --> 02:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
was made by the state for like of a
 
02:38:14.830 --> 02:38:14.840 align:start position:0%
better word um and we seem to be jumping
 
02:38:18.429 --> 02:38:18.439 align:start position:0%
in pretty quickly uh to a
 
02:38:18.439 --> 02:38:20.510 align:start position:0%
in pretty quickly uh to a
giant

02:38:20.510 --> 02:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
giant
 
02:38:24.230 --> 02:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
solution uh which I clearly the initial
 
02:38:27.309 --> 02:38:27.319 align:start position:0%
thing we saw was Overkill and clearly
 
02:38:29.710 --> 02:38:29.720 align:start position:0%
it's been being worked down which is
 
02:38:31.910 --> 02:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
great but it seems to me it would be
 
02:38:35.150 --> 02:38:35.160 align:start position:0%
make more sense to go the other way uh
 
02:38:36.269 --> 02:38:36.279 align:start position:0%
which I think is kind of what chairman
 
02:38:38.910 --> 02:38:38.920 align:start position:0%
Ed Edwards was getting at you know where
 
02:38:42.309 --> 02:38:42.319 align:start position:0%
are we now versus when this event
 
02:38:45.030 --> 02:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
happened so we've come ways
 
02:38:47.750 --> 02:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
already and what can we do incrementally
 
02:38:50.830 --> 02:38:50.840 align:start position:0%
from here as opposed to uh trying to
 
02:38:53.469 --> 02:38:53.479 align:start position:0%
jump in and and I I'm one of those who
 
02:38:55.070 --> 02:38:55.080 align:start position:0%
considers the finance committee a policy
 
02:38:56.510 --> 02:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
committee as well I don't need to go
 
02:38:58.309 --> 02:38:58.319 align:start position:0%
back and forth about whether we're doing
 
02:39:00.110 --> 02:39:00.120 align:start position:0%
policy or not doing policy whether it's
 
02:39:02.269 --> 02:39:02.279 align:start position:0%
on our side or on the other side I think
 
02:39:03.630 --> 02:39:03.640 align:start position:0%
it's that's the way the process works
 
02:39:04.910 --> 02:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
here it's the way been my experiences
 
02:39:10.429 --> 02:39:10.439 align:start position:0%
have been here um however this is a huge
 
02:39:13.469 --> 02:39:13.479 align:start position:0%
uh policy which has you know is coming
 
02:39:16.030 --> 02:39:16.040 align:start position:0%
forward and it seems like it should be a
 
02:39:19.429 --> 02:39:19.439 align:start position:0%
little more incremental um given the
 
02:39:21.870 --> 02:39:21.880 align:start position:0%
cost associated with it in the second
 
02:39:24.269 --> 02:39:24.279 align:start position:0%
year um of a bium so I'll just leave it
 
02:39:26.150 --> 02:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
at that and let you all respond to that
 
02:39:29.630 --> 02:39:29.640 align:start position:0%
or not this is work session we're really
 
02:39:31.389 --> 02:39:31.399 align:start position:0%
talking to each other so if so if you
 
02:39:33.590 --> 02:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
want you respond to that or not no if
 
02:39:35.870 --> 02:39:35.880 align:start position:0%
you want to ask a question of fact go
 
02:39:40.269 --> 02:39:40.279 align:start position:0%
ahead but opinions are ours at this
 
02:39:42.670 --> 02:39:42.680 align:start position:0%
point other than asking what is the
 
02:39:45.030 --> 02:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
total amount of spending you're
 
02:39:49.070 --> 02:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
anticipating no and I I I I I don't
 
02:39:51.309 --> 02:39:51.319 align:start position:0%
think that that's we're really ready for
 
02:39:53.710 --> 02:39:53.720 align:start position:0%
that do do you have you don't have a
 
02:39:57.070 --> 02:39:57.080 align:start position:0%
revised draft fiscal note do you either
 
02:40:01.790 --> 02:40:01.800 align:start position:0%
Mr Ripple or or or or Mr White based you
 
02:40:05.950 --> 02:40:05.960 align:start position:0%
do no for um for
 
02:40:10.230 --> 02:40:10.240 align:start position:0%
1290 or 12 or 1291
 
02:40:14.670 --> 02:40:14.680 align:start position:0%
either yeah okay so so we we we don't
 
02:40:18.349 --> 02:40:18.359 align:start position:0%
have those all right uh represent tki
 
02:40:21.230 --> 02:40:21.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:40:21.240 --> 02:40:23.230 align:start position:0%
thank you
listening

02:40:23.230 --> 02:40:23.240 align:start position:0%
listening
 
02:40:26.630 --> 02:40:26.640 align:start position:0%
to what I've heard today and what I
 
02:40:29.870 --> 02:40:29.880 align:start position:0%
understand there was
 
02:40:33.110 --> 02:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
um an extremely
 
02:40:33.120 --> 02:40:34.870 align:start position:0%
um an extremely
disturbing

02:40:34.870 --> 02:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
disturbing
 
02:40:39.030 --> 02:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
um situation that involved children that
 
02:40:42.150 --> 02:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
were placed out of state and from what I
 
02:40:45.190 --> 02:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
understand the department and the office
 
02:40:46.309 --> 02:40:46.319 align:start position:0%
of child
 
02:40:49.429 --> 02:40:49.439 align:start position:0%
advocate were in two different places
 
02:40:52.630 --> 02:40:52.640 align:start position:0%
and they were trying to work together to
 
02:40:56.070 --> 02:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
ensure that they could come to some
 
02:40:58.550 --> 02:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
place putting the children first and
 
02:41:00.670 --> 02:41:00.680 align:start position:0%
make sure that they have the best care
 
02:41:02.950 --> 02:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
possible and I know that between the
 
02:41:05.870 --> 02:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
Pearson Amendment the walner amendment
 
02:41:11.110 --> 02:41:11.120 align:start position:0%
um both sides have worked together and
 
02:41:13.950 --> 02:41:13.960 align:start position:0%
come pretty close as we've just heard
 
02:41:21.030 --> 02:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
very close I also just heard that um
 
02:41:23.150 --> 02:41:23.160 align:start position:0%
due to changes in leadership and I'd
 
02:41:24.510 --> 02:41:24.520 align:start position:0%
like to welcome the new director I'm not
 
02:41:26.990 --> 02:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
sure I've had you here in front of our
 
02:41:30.830 --> 02:41:30.840 align:start position:0%
division before um that having specific
 
02:41:34.030 --> 02:41:34.040 align:start position:0%
guidelines in statute is helpful to help
 
02:41:37.710 --> 02:41:37.720 align:start position:0%
with transitions in leadership and would
 
02:41:40.389 --> 02:41:40.399 align:start position:0%
you say that having these kinds of
 
02:41:43.630 --> 02:41:43.640 align:start position:0%
guidelines and statute are helpful to
 
02:41:46.150 --> 02:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
both the office of child advocate and
 
02:41:48.309 --> 02:41:48.319 align:start position:0%
the department to be able to work
 
02:41:51.870 --> 02:41:51.880 align:start position:0%
together and have guidelines to ensure
 
02:41:54.790 --> 02:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
that the best is being done for children
 
02:42:02.590 --> 02:42:02.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:05.510 --> 02:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
placements I think legislation's helpful
 
02:42:08.269 --> 02:42:08.279 align:start position:0%
um seen it in other states where it's
 
02:42:11.670 --> 02:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
really really been uh a sea change here
 
02:42:13.309 --> 02:42:13.319 align:start position:0%
not so much because the work is being
 
02:42:14.790 --> 02:42:14.800 align:start position:0%
done and there's a lot of camaraderie
 
02:42:16.429 --> 02:42:16.439 align:start position:0%
and a lot of similarities in our
 
02:42:20.150 --> 02:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
philosophies with OCA and the division
 
02:42:23.630 --> 02:42:23.640 align:start position:0%
um uh but I do think that you know the
 
02:42:25.429 --> 02:42:25.439 align:start position:0%
work all the work that was done to come
 
02:42:27.670 --> 02:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
to compromise and to agree on so many
 
02:42:30.630 --> 02:42:30.640 align:start position:0%
things um I think it's really cool and
 
02:42:32.309 --> 02:42:32.319 align:start position:0%
it's something that you know is is
 
02:42:34.309 --> 02:42:34.319 align:start position:0%
really a Triumph in in The Advocate
 
02:42:36.550 --> 02:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
community and the and the the people who
 
02:42:39.590 --> 02:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
implement the policy coming together um
 
02:42:41.469 --> 02:42:41.479 align:start position:0%
it's it's really um
 
02:42:45.830 --> 02:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
applaudable um to be applauded I I think
 
02:42:48.190 --> 02:42:48.200 align:start position:0%
though um it should be realistic and I
 
02:42:50.429 --> 02:42:50.439 align:start position:0%
think it was um we were doing these
 
02:42:54.429 --> 02:42:54.439 align:start position:0%
visits anyhow um uh certification was
 
02:42:56.750 --> 02:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
being done and this sort of just puts
 
02:42:59.670 --> 02:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
some parameters around it
 
02:43:02.510 --> 02:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
um and we've been trying to create new
 
02:43:04.110 --> 02:43:04.120 align:start position:0%
programming for kids so they don't have
 
02:43:06.590 --> 02:43:06.600 align:start position:0%
to go out of state or out of region um
 
02:43:08.710 --> 02:43:08.720 align:start position:0%
this has all been in in the works and a
 
02:43:10.389 --> 02:43:10.399 align:start position:0%
lot more work has to be done in fact I
 
02:43:12.590 --> 02:43:12.600 align:start position:0%
think the real influx of dollars needs
 
02:43:14.830 --> 02:43:14.840 align:start position:0%
to be in creating the new services and
 
02:43:16.590 --> 02:43:16.600 align:start position:0%
the bridge funds so we can create
 
02:43:18.670 --> 02:43:18.680 align:start position:0%
quality programs to BR to legitimately
 
02:43:20.269 --> 02:43:20.279 align:start position:0%
bring these kids home and also prevent
 
02:43:22.630 --> 02:43:22.640 align:start position:0%
in future years from them going out so I
 
02:43:24.630 --> 02:43:24.640 align:start position:0%
think um we you may see us in
 
02:43:26.870 --> 02:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
legislation coming forward in in in in
 
02:43:29.790 --> 02:43:29.800 align:start position:0%
future months uh to talk about that to
 
02:43:31.429 --> 02:43:31.439 align:start position:0%
really build a strong Continuum right
 
02:43:33.990 --> 02:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire and that could
 
02:43:36.790 --> 02:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
also be funded as kids come home those
 
02:43:39.230 --> 02:43:39.240 align:start position:0%
dollars can be redirected to create a
 
02:43:41.230 --> 02:43:41.240 align:start position:0%
stronger uh New Hampshire Continuum of
 
02:43:44.110 --> 02:43:44.120 align:start position:0%
Care so I think you know it's I just
 
02:43:45.750 --> 02:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
want to just say that what we came up
 
02:43:49.630 --> 02:43:49.640 align:start position:0%
with prior to this amendment was strong
 
02:43:52.150 --> 02:43:52.160 align:start position:0%
great guidelines there was agreement the
 
02:43:54.309 --> 02:43:54.319 align:start position:0%
only difference is will we have enough
 
02:43:57.469 --> 02:43:57.479 align:start position:0%
resources to carry it out thank you can
 
02:44:00.510 --> 02:44:00.520 align:start position:0%
I go go go go ahead but I'm I had a hard
 
02:44:04.269 --> 02:44:04.279 align:start position:0%
stop at 2:45 that's in three minutes so
 
02:44:05.710 --> 02:44:05.720 align:start position:0%
uh let I'll quick go to the office of
 
02:44:07.590 --> 02:44:07.600 align:start position:0%
child advocate Lissa do you I know that
 
02:44:10.790 --> 02:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
this is not the ideal final product that
 
02:44:13.349 --> 02:44:13.359 align:start position:0%
your department wanted which one now
 
02:44:15.870 --> 02:44:15.880 align:start position:0%
though TW though both of them are not
 
02:44:17.510 --> 02:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
the what the dep office of child
 
02:44:19.469 --> 02:44:19.479 align:start position:0%
advocate wanted nor the Pearson
 
02:44:19.479 --> 02:44:20.630 align:start position:0%
advocate wanted nor the Pearson
Amendment

02:44:20.630 --> 02:44:20.640 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
02:44:23.590 --> 02:44:23.600 align:start position:0%
correct um that you were pushing for
 
02:44:26.750 --> 02:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
something else and do you feel that
 
02:44:30.790 --> 02:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
having this kind of guidance actually um
 
02:44:34.630 --> 02:44:34.640 align:start position:0%
enables the two departments to work
 
02:44:36.910 --> 02:44:36.920 align:start position:0%
together concurrently and actually know
 
02:44:38.830 --> 02:44:38.840 align:start position:0%
what the M the goals are in the end and
 
02:44:40.830 --> 02:44:40.840 align:start position:0%
it's better than where we're at now
 
02:44:41.670 --> 02:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
02:44:44.910 --> 02:44:44.920 align:start position:0%
representative tki absolutely
 
02:44:48.630 --> 02:44:48.640 align:start position:0%
1290 does reflect a majority of the
 
02:44:50.990 --> 02:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
agreement M ments that we have had since
 
02:44:54.429 --> 02:44:54.439 align:start position:0%
last August um when the bledo incident
 
02:44:56.230 --> 02:44:56.240 align:start position:0%
came to light I would just like to
 
02:45:00.429 --> 02:45:00.439 align:start position:0%
clarify though um bledo was the incident
 
02:45:03.349 --> 02:45:03.359 align:start position:0%
that set this off bledo is not a
 
02:45:07.030 --> 02:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
one-time incident it is not an outlier
 
02:45:08.750 --> 02:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
we can tell you about kids that have
 
02:45:11.150 --> 02:45:11.160 align:start position:0%
been tased in facilities and park I'm
 
02:45:12.750 --> 02:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
going to cut you off because that's
 
02:45:15.349 --> 02:45:15.359 align:start position:0%
outside the scope of the question and
 
02:45:17.990 --> 02:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm just I I I'm trying to get us to
 
02:45:21.990 --> 02:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
a conclusion here so so uh we're we're
 
02:45:23.870 --> 02:45:23.880 align:start position:0%
we're and I think you actually said that
 
02:45:26.230 --> 02:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
in testimony the first day we listened
 
02:45:30.269 --> 02:45:30.279 align:start position:0%
to 1273 so um I'm I'm going to call a
 
02:45:32.389 --> 02:45:32.399 align:start position:0%
fem minute recess and we're going to
 
02:45:33.950 --> 02:45:33.960 align:start position:0%
come back and we're going to vote on
 
02:45:47.910 --> 02:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:47.920 --> 02:46:17.910 align:start position:0%
 
250

02:46:17.910 --> 02:46:17.920 align:start position:0%

call us out of recess um on um 1573 the
 
02:53:25.710 --> 02:53:25.720 align:start position:0%
last item of the day I would like to
 
02:53:29.590 --> 02:53:29.600 align:start position:0%
propose that uh Mr Ripple that we send

1291 back over to Os or that we get
 
02:53:36.389 --> 02:53:36.399 align:start position:0%
ready to do that with the idea that
 
02:53:37.710 --> 02:53:37.720 align:start position:0%

on on on page lines 9 7 through n page 4
 
02:53:48.269 --> 02:53:48.279 align:start position:0%
7 to9 any placement of a child outside

I I would like that added to a new
 
02:54:02.510 --> 02:54:02.520 align:start position:0%

02:54:30.229 --> 02:54:30.239 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:54:35.710 --> 02:54:35.720 align:start position:0%
second okay so if any further discussion
 
02:54:38.229 --> 02:54:38.239 align:start position:0%
representative priest yes I would like
 
02:54:43.269 --> 02:54:43.279 align:start position:0%
to go on the record and and voice my
 
02:54:47.110 --> 02:54:47.120 align:start position:0%
opinion that the amendment
 
02:54:48.830 --> 02:54:48.840 align:start position:0%
1290 was
 
02:54:52.750 --> 02:54:52.760 align:start position:0%
was the result of both of these
 
02:54:56.510 --> 02:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
departments and the previous legislative
 
02:54:58.469 --> 02:54:58.479 align:start position:0%
committee working together and
 
02:55:01.150 --> 02:55:01.160 align:start position:0%
addressing this problem and it spells
 
02:55:03.910 --> 02:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
out the responsibilities and the duties
 
02:55:07.510 --> 02:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
of everyone and I think this is far more
 
02:55:09.790 --> 02:55:09.800 align:start position:0%
comprehensive than
 
02:55:12.630 --> 02:55:12.640 align:start position:0%
1291 thank you thank you I think you're
 
02:55:14.750 --> 02:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
going to see that again in Senate Bill
 
02:55:17.389 --> 02:55:17.399 align:start position:0%
417 and and we've already heard that the
 
02:55:19.630 --> 02:55:19.640 align:start position:0%
Department's implementing the the the
 
02:55:23.790 --> 02:55:23.800 align:start position:0%
policies so and may I just again I we
 
02:55:25.670 --> 02:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
shouldn't assume what we're going to be
 
02:55:28.269 --> 02:55:28.279 align:start position:0%
seeing from the Senate we should be
 
02:55:31.309 --> 02:55:31.319 align:start position:0%
sending over the best bill that
 
02:55:33.670 --> 02:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
addresses the problem that we have and
 
02:55:36.910 --> 02:55:36.920 align:start position:0%
this is a as has been stated before this
 
02:55:40.269 --> 02:55:40.279 align:start position:0%
is a very serious problem that needs to
 
02:55:42.750 --> 02:55:42.760 align:start position:0%
be addressed it's not one occurrence
 
02:55:45.630 --> 02:55:45.640 align:start position:0%
it's been happening a lot and we need to
 
02:55:47.590 --> 02:55:47.600 align:start position:0%
have something that's spelled out so the
 
02:55:51.110 --> 02:55:51.120 align:start position:0%
department will know what is expected of
 
02:55:54.790 --> 02:55:54.800 align:start position:0%
them and what we will be seeing as a
 
02:55:57.750 --> 02:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
result of their work and this is not
 
02:55:58.790 --> 02:55:58.800 align:start position:0%
done in
 
02:56:01.510 --> 02:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
1291 thank you representative
 
02:56:04.190 --> 02:56:04.200 align:start position:0%
walner thank
 
02:56:07.229 --> 02:56:07.239 align:start position:0%
you today the director from the
 
02:56:09.670 --> 02:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
Department the director of um division
 
02:56:12.790 --> 02:56:12.800 align:start position:0%
of Children and Families has a come
 
02:56:16.110 --> 02:56:16.120 align:start position:0%
before us today and said
 
02:56:19.469 --> 02:56:19.479 align:start position:0%
that he feels it's a needed
 
02:56:24.150 --> 02:56:24.160 align:start position:0%
Bill he he is here representing the
 
02:56:26.910 --> 02:56:26.920 align:start position:0%
department and feeling like he needs
 
02:56:30.670 --> 02:56:30.680 align:start position:0%
this kind of a piece of legislation in
 
02:56:33.229 --> 02:56:33.239 align:start position:0%
order to be sure that this work is
 
02:56:36.550 --> 02:56:36.560 align:start position:0%
carried out the way it needs to be and
 
02:56:40.269 --> 02:56:40.279 align:start position:0%
um I think that he made a great point in
 
02:56:43.670 --> 02:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
that leadership
 
02:56:46.710 --> 02:56:46.720 align:start position:0%
changes and we've seen it so often at
 
02:56:49.110 --> 02:56:49.120 align:start position:0%
the department where leadership does
 
02:56:53.070 --> 02:56:53.080 align:start position:0%
change and that needing this kind of a
 
02:56:56.510 --> 02:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
of some in a bill in
 
02:56:59.710 --> 02:56:59.720 align:start position:0%
legislation in statute is what we need
 
02:57:01.710 --> 02:57:01.720 align:start position:0%
so that the department knows the
 
02:57:03.510 --> 02:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
direction the legislature wants them to
 
02:57:06.510 --> 02:57:06.520 align:start position:0%
take with um the oversight of these
 
02:57:09.389 --> 02:57:09.399 align:start position:0%
children in out of home
 
02:57:13.110 --> 02:57:13.120 align:start position:0%
placement so I heard that testimony and
 
02:57:16.790 --> 02:57:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh Mr uh flasher is going to be around
 
02:57:19.030 --> 02:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
for a while he's already implemented the
 
02:57:21.670 --> 02:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
changes Miss fox has already implemented
 
02:57:24.790 --> 02:57:24.800 align:start position:0%
changes so we're we're we're good until
 
02:57:27.750 --> 02:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
there is a change in leadership uh I I
 
02:57:29.510 --> 02:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
don't know that we have one
 
02:57:32.870 --> 02:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
forecasted um so I think we have time to
 
02:57:34.950 --> 02:57:34.960 align:start position:0%
to get this right this is still not the
 
02:57:37.910 --> 02:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
right bill to me it's 15 new FTE this is
 
02:57:40.590 --> 02:57:40.600 align:start position:0%
just way too much particularly when the
 
02:57:43.830 --> 02:57:43.840 align:start position:0%
testimony said that we're going to come
 
02:57:46.590 --> 02:57:46.600 align:start position:0%
back with another bill later to spend
 
02:57:48.550 --> 02:57:48.560 align:start position:0%
more money on bring and make making sure
 
02:57:50.950 --> 02:57:50.960 align:start position:0%
that kids never leave the state well you
 
02:57:53.870 --> 02:57:53.880 align:start position:0%
can't keep spending 15 FTE at a time and
 
02:57:55.910 --> 02:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
still have the resources available to do
 
02:57:57.309 --> 02:57:57.319 align:start position:0%
what's the right thing in the first
 
02:58:00.710 --> 02:58:00.720 align:start position:0%
place which is just keep people home um
 
02:58:03.269 --> 02:58:03.279 align:start position:0%
so what we didn't ask Mr flasher and I
 
02:58:06.229 --> 02:58:06.239 align:start position:0%
did that didn't ask out of a concern
 
02:58:09.670 --> 02:58:09.680 align:start position:0%
over time is uh if he'd ever seen any
 
02:58:12.309 --> 02:58:12.319 align:start position:0%
legisl any situations in which
 
02:58:14.710 --> 02:58:14.720 align:start position:0%
legislative legislation was so
 
02:58:17.710 --> 02:58:17.720 align:start position:0%
restrictive it undermined the discretion
 
02:58:19.830 --> 02:58:19.840 align:start position:0%
and the ability of management to be
 
02:58:22.030 --> 02:58:22.040 align:start position:0%
flexible and I'll just say from my
 
02:58:24.309 --> 02:58:24.319 align:start position:0%
perspective having been in the military
 
02:58:27.790 --> 02:58:27.800 align:start position:0%
I have seen where topown commands are so
 
02:58:31.110 --> 02:58:31.120 align:start position:0%
restrictive that they really over time
 
02:58:33.670 --> 02:58:33.680 align:start position:0%
don't age well and commands are doing
 
02:58:36.030 --> 02:58:36.040 align:start position:0%
things that they shouldn't do because
 
02:58:37.950 --> 02:58:37.960 align:start position:0%
they've been told in regulation that
 
02:58:42.670 --> 02:58:42.680 align:start position:0%
they must be done so um so go ahead yeah
 
02:58:44.990 --> 02:58:45.000 align:start position:0%
this is just really a question I have of
 
02:58:48.670 --> 02:58:48.680 align:start position:0%
I guess you or maybe maybe um
 
02:58:52.550 --> 02:58:52.560 align:start position:0%
Mr Ripple about
 
02:58:58.229 --> 02:58:58.239 align:start position:0%
in 1291 the appropriation is to the
 
02:59:00.510 --> 02:59:00.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
02:59:03.910 --> 02:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
and does that mean that the court is not
 
02:59:06.110 --> 02:59:06.120 align:start position:0%
there are no changes in any kind of
 
02:59:08.910 --> 02:59:08.920 align:start position:0%
requirements by the court and there's no
 
02:59:11.150 --> 02:59:11.160 align:start position:0%
appropriation to the court is that
 
02:59:15.309 --> 02:59:15.319 align:start position:0%
correct I I believe that's correct
 
02:59:18.309 --> 02:59:18.319 align:start position:0%
yes um the if I'm not mistaken at the
 
02:59:20.990 --> 02:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
bottom of page seven no she this one the
 
02:59:22.990 --> 02:59:23.000 align:start position:0%
short one the short Amendment oh the
 
02:59:25.150 --> 02:59:25.160 align:start position:0%
short Amendment
 
02:59:28.070 --> 02:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
h i I think that's a good
 
02:59:30.870 --> 02:59:30.880 align:start position:0%
observation all right so is there any
 
02:59:33.030 --> 02:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
further discussion on 1291 with the
 
02:59:37.110 --> 02:59:37.120 align:start position:0%
verbal um modification to include line
 
02:59:39.790 --> 02:59:39.800 align:start position:0%
seven go ahead I just want to point out
 
02:59:41.870 --> 02:59:41.880 align:start position:0%
one thing it may be insignificant but
 
02:59:45.110 --> 02:59:45.120 align:start position:0%
it's I believe the uh statement of
 
02:59:47.190 --> 02:59:47.200 align:start position:0%
purpose and findings in 1291 was
 
02:59:48.710 --> 02:59:48.720 align:start position:0%
supposed to be ident identical to that
 
02:59:51.790 --> 02:59:51.800 align:start position:0%
in 129h and it is not it's an older
 
02:59:53.830 --> 02:59:53.840 align:start position:0%
version um so there are a few minor
 
02:59:56.349 --> 02:59:56.359 align:start position:0%
differences here uh for example if you
 
02:59:58.349 --> 02:59:58.359 align:start position:0%
look at 1290 there are some RSA
 
03:00:00.990 --> 03:00:01.000 align:start position:0%
references on line six and seven if you
 
03:00:03.630 --> 03:00:03.640 align:start position:0%
go down to line 19 of page one it refers
 
03:00:05.590 --> 03:00:05.600 align:start position:0%
to an acceptable primary reason for
 
03:00:07.269 --> 03:00:07.279 align:start position:0%
placement in a residential facility so
 
03:00:08.790 --> 03:00:08.800 align:start position:0%
there are some minor differences that
 
03:00:10.590 --> 03:00:10.600 align:start position:0%
aren't aren't reflect could you go ahead
 
03:00:12.630 --> 03:00:12.640 align:start position:0%
and fix those because the guidance I
 
03:00:14.349 --> 03:00:14.359 align:start position:0%
gave was that that they were supposed to
 
03:00:17.070 --> 03:00:17.080 align:start position:0%
be identical I can do that Y and and one
 
03:00:19.349 --> 03:00:19.359 align:start position:0%
of the things that also I think got
 
03:00:21.229 --> 03:00:21.239 align:start position:0%
dropped from the Pearson amendment was
 
03:00:22.910 --> 03:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
the first
 
03:00:26.190 --> 03:00:26.200 align:start position:0%
line around
 
03:00:26.200 --> 03:00:27.870 align:start position:0%
line around
qualified

03:00:27.870 --> 03:00:27.880 align:start position:0%
qualified
 
03:00:31.349 --> 03:00:31.359 align:start position:0%
the I I I thought we wanted to go ahead
 
03:00:32.630 --> 03:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
and keep the
 
03:00:32.640 --> 03:00:34.830 align:start position:0%
and keep the
qualified

03:00:34.830 --> 03:00:34.840 align:start position:0%
qualified
 
03:00:37.750 --> 03:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
clarification go ahead um so the
 
03:00:39.790 --> 03:00:39.800 align:start position:0%
qualified was really throughout the text
 
03:00:40.710 --> 03:00:40.720 align:start position:0%
of the
 
03:00:43.469 --> 03:00:43.479 align:start position:0%
bill and and that's not in the purpose
 
03:00:45.870 --> 03:00:45.880 align:start position:0%
and findings so that's why that line
 
03:00:47.990 --> 03:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
didn't but I wanted to keep it do we not
 
03:00:49.910 --> 03:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
need to keep that we don't need to keep
 
03:00:56.229 --> 03:00:56.239 align:start position:0%
no we don't okay great all right so do
 
03:00:59.990 --> 03:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
have since you made the the motion I'm
 
03:01:01.510 --> 03:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
getting ready to take a vote because
 
03:01:03.190 --> 03:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
we're we're running out of time and I
 
03:01:04.670 --> 03:01:04.680 align:start position:0%
think we've discussed this and we know
 
03:01:07.910 --> 03:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
our positions at this point so
 
03:01:10.910 --> 03:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
representative Earth you made a motion
 
03:01:13.550 --> 03:01:13.560 align:start position:0%
to include the additional language will
 
03:01:15.830 --> 03:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
you update it so that it's an identical
 
03:01:16.910 --> 03:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
purpose and
 
03:01:16.920 --> 03:01:36.229 align:start position:0%
purpose and
finding

03:01:36.229 --> 03:01:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:39.349 --> 03:01:39.359 align:start position:0%
do do you second okay representing
 
03:01:42.710 --> 03:01:42.720 align:start position:0%
walner I guess my my question is one of
 
03:01:46.070 --> 03:01:46.080 align:start position:0%
of the chair about I know that we have
 
03:01:49.110 --> 03:01:49.120 align:start position:0%
on a couple of other occasions today
 
03:01:53.150 --> 03:01:53.160 align:start position:0%
um made amendments sort of on the fly to
 
03:01:57.349 --> 03:01:57.359 align:start position:0%
amendments um and we agreed with them
 
03:02:00.190 --> 03:02:00.200 align:start position:0%
this one to me feels like this is such
 
03:02:02.750 --> 03:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
an important bill that I'm wondering if
 
03:02:05.150 --> 03:02:05.160 align:start position:0%
we are going to get an opportunity to
 
03:02:07.830 --> 03:02:07.840 align:start position:0%
see this final Amendment that's going to
 
03:02:11.510 --> 03:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
be voted on and have a final vote so
 
03:02:14.790 --> 03:02:14.800 align:start position:0%
that any vote taken here at this point
 
03:02:17.429 --> 03:02:17.439 align:start position:0%
would be s a preliminary until we've
 
03:02:20.389 --> 03:02:20.399 align:start position:0%
actually had a chance to see final
 
03:02:22.590 --> 03:02:22.600 align:start position:0%
Amendment so like the other two the
 
03:02:24.229 --> 03:02:24.239 align:start position:0%
implication was that we were going to
 
03:02:26.150 --> 03:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
validate that they were consistent with
 
03:02:30.229 --> 03:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
our vote and and the default was that if
 
03:02:32.550 --> 03:02:32.560 align:start position:0%
they were consistent then we would
 
03:02:35.870 --> 03:02:35.880 align:start position:0%
accept them uh if they weren't and and I
 
03:02:37.990 --> 03:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
think I think the rational Assumption of
 
03:02:41.389 --> 03:02:41.399 align:start position:0%
what's been done in division 3 before is
 
03:02:45.630 --> 03:02:45.640 align:start position:0%
if if there's an error we'll fix it okay
 
03:02:48.510 --> 03:02:48.520 align:start position:0%
and and that is the same with this
 
03:02:50.309 --> 03:02:50.319 align:start position:0%
we're going to get a chance to look at
 
03:02:52.469 --> 03:02:52.479 align:start position:0%
it beforehand I don't consider this a
 
03:02:54.870 --> 03:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
preliminary vote I consider this the
 
03:02:59.150 --> 03:02:59.160 align:start position:0%
vote and if the um language comes back
 
03:03:03.070 --> 03:03:03.080 align:start position:0%
as we are voting on it then the vote
 
03:03:06.190 --> 03:03:06.200 align:start position:0%
stands if there's an error we'll address
 
03:03:10.269 --> 03:03:10.279 align:start position:0%
the error and when will we do that well
 
03:03:12.750 --> 03:03:12.760 align:start position:0%
we'll do it during the finance committee
 
03:03:14.790 --> 03:03:14.800 align:start position:0%
because uh we're going to distribute
 
03:03:18.990 --> 03:03:19.000 align:start position:0%
these amendments U hopefully by off copy
 
03:03:22.429 --> 03:03:22.439 align:start position:0%
earlier rather than later but no later
 
03:03:25.070 --> 03:03:25.080 align:start position:0%
than our voting on them in the full
 
03:03:27.630 --> 03:03:27.640 align:start position:0%
finance committee so will these be on
 
03:03:30.630 --> 03:03:30.640 align:start position:0%
are these on the agenda for Tuesday
 
03:03:32.870 --> 03:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
Tuesday afternoon I I don't I don't know
 
03:03:32.880 --> 03:03:33.870 align:start position:0%
Tuesday afternoon I I don't I don't know
the

03:03:33.870 --> 03:03:33.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:03:37.710 --> 03:03:37.720 align:start position:0%
agenda I I I I I I wanted them to be
 
03:03:39.790 --> 03:03:39.800 align:start position:0%
because I thought today was our last day
 
03:03:43.429 --> 03:03:43.439 align:start position:0%
to do our our work and I wanted them
 
03:03:45.590 --> 03:03:45.600 align:start position:0%
over to the full finance committee Mr
 
03:03:48.950 --> 03:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
chair yeah so just so to reiterate what
 
03:03:51.670 --> 03:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
I just heard you say right relative to
 
03:03:54.790 --> 03:03:54.800 align:start position:0%
what the amendment is we are taking
 
03:03:57.030 --> 03:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
wholesale from
 
03:04:02.110 --> 03:04:02.120 align:start position:0%
129h SE lines one page one lines one
 
03:04:04.870 --> 03:04:04.880 align:start position:0%
through the bottom and then page two
 
03:04:07.110 --> 03:04:07.120 align:start position:0%
lines one through five which is all of
 
03:04:09.870 --> 03:04:09.880 align:start position:0%
section one inclusive and then adding
 
03:04:12.429 --> 03:04:12.439 align:start position:0%
just those three lines from page four 7
 
03:04:14.830 --> 03:04:14.840 align:start position:0%
8 and N into one combined Amendment
 
03:04:17.190 --> 03:04:17.200 align:start position:0%
verbatim and that's and then adding
 
03:04:20.030 --> 03:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
section two which was the
 
03:04:23.469 --> 03:04:23.479 align:start position:0%
appropriation yes okay I I I'm I'm
 
03:04:25.229 --> 03:04:25.239 align:start position:0%
trying to clarify what we're seeing
 
03:04:26.469 --> 03:04:26.479 align:start position:0%
because we don't have it in front of us
 
03:04:28.229 --> 03:04:28.239 align:start position:0%
physically but it's there in pieces
 
03:04:30.510 --> 03:04:30.520 align:start position:0%
across multiple sheets of paper I I I
 
03:04:33.670 --> 03:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
would entertain a motion to interim
 
03:04:36.510 --> 03:04:36.520 align:start position:0%
study I'm I'm trying I'm trying to keep
 
03:04:38.590 --> 03:04:38.600 align:start position:0%
some momentum and keep things moving
 
03:04:41.590 --> 03:04:41.600 align:start position:0%
without it being study right now if that
 
03:04:43.910 --> 03:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
was an appropriate
 
03:04:47.349 --> 03:04:47.359 align:start position:0%
motion um let let's let's let's take a
 
03:04:49.950 --> 03:04:49.960 align:start position:0%
let's take a vote on this and then uh
 
03:04:51.830 --> 03:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
we'll take a vote on the other Amendment
 
03:04:54.110 --> 03:04:54.120 align:start position:0%
and then we can consider whether or not
 
03:04:56.790 --> 03:04:56.800 align:start position:0%
an interim study is a more appropriate
 
03:04:59.469 --> 03:04:59.479 align:start position:0%
motion representative Lon um thank you
 
03:05:01.510 --> 03:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I think possibly the reason
 
03:05:03.349 --> 03:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
why the entire thing didn't come out the
 
03:05:05.710 --> 03:05:05.720 align:start position:0%
second to last sentence um in that
 
03:05:07.389 --> 03:05:07.399 align:start position:0%
section one is just talking about the
 
03:05:09.429 --> 03:05:09.439 align:start position:0%
Appropriations so of everything except
 
03:05:10.950 --> 03:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
for the second to last sentence that
 
03:05:12.590 --> 03:05:12.600 align:start position:0%
says to allow for the expansion of these
 
03:05:14.790 --> 03:05:14.800 align:start position:0%
services and talks about the effective
 
03:05:16.630 --> 03:05:16.640 align:start position:0%
date um I would think that bringing
 
03:05:18.950 --> 03:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
everything except for that one sentence
 
03:05:24.110 --> 03:05:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:26.150 --> 03:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
that that says to allow for the
 
03:05:27.590 --> 03:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
expansion of these services to be
 
03:05:29.670 --> 03:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
implemented in a thoughtful and detail
 
03:05:29.680 --> 03:05:30.910 align:start position:0%
implemented in a thoughtful and detail
detailed

03:05:30.910 --> 03:05:30.920 align:start position:0%
detailed
 
03:05:33.110 --> 03:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
manner so without correct that would
 
03:05:35.469 --> 03:05:35.479 align:start position:0%
probably not be in this amendment would
 
03:05:37.269 --> 03:05:37.279 align:start position:0%
end with residential
 
03:05:40.030 --> 03:05:40.040 align:start position:0%
setting on page two line
 
03:05:42.070 --> 03:05:42.080 align:start position:0%
one do you have
 
03:05:45.429 --> 03:05:45.439 align:start position:0%
that yes I do everything before
 
03:05:50.950 --> 03:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
uh to allow on page two line one
 
03:05:54.630 --> 03:05:54.640 align:start position:0%
yes all right represent walner yes could
 
03:05:58.670 --> 03:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
I just ask Kevin could you maybe um
 
03:06:00.950 --> 03:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
provide us with a list of all the things
 
03:06:02.790 --> 03:06:02.800 align:start position:0%
that are supposed we're supposed to be
 
03:06:04.870 --> 03:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
looking for in this amendment that we're
 
03:06:05.750 --> 03:06:05.760 align:start position:0%

03:06:07.910 --> 03:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
