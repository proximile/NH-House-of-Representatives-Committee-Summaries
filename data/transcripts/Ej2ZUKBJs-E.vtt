00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
all right so welcome to a hopefully
 
00:24:56.590 --> 00:24:56.600 align:start position:0%
brief I say that um executive session of
 
00:24:57.789 --> 00:24:57.799 align:start position:0%
the special committee on housing the
 
00:24:59.830 --> 00:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
first order business I want to take up
 
00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:02.200 align:start position:0%
um is we're receiving Senate messages um
 
00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
I just received a senate message about
 
00:25:06.389 --> 00:25:06.399 align:start position:0%
HB 1168 which if the committee were
 
00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
members is that study committee to deal
 
00:25:11.149 --> 00:25:11.159 align:start position:0%
with um the housing crisis on people
 
00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
with disabilities um all the Senate did
 
00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
was amend it to put out the effective
 
00:25:18.549 --> 00:25:18.559 align:start position:0%
date make an interm report honor before
 
00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:21.720 align:start position:0%
November 1st 2024 and then have a final
 
00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:25.640 align:start position:0%
report by November 1st 2025 to give them
 
00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:27.480 align:start position:0%
more opportunity to look into this
 
00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
should they want to I am planning on
 
00:25:31.669 --> 00:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
concurring is there any objection to
 
00:25:33.149 --> 00:25:33.159 align:start position:0%
that I just want to bring it across the
 
00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
committee do not concur
 
00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:39.240 align:start position:0%
concur okay um so the next order
 
00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:41.000 align:start position:0%
business I'll entertain a motion on SB
 
00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:44.600 align:start position:0%
408 which is relative to um the same
 
00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
study committee um studying the impact
 
00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:50.200 align:start position:0%
of the housing crisis with people with
 
00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
disabilities I move itl okay U moved by
 
00:25:56.830 --> 00:25:56.840 align:start position:0%
representative re itl someone thinks
 
00:25:59.630 --> 00:25:59.640 align:start position:0%
differently is there second second by
 
00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:07.720 align:start position:0%
discussion it's the duplicate of what we
 
00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:09.480 align:start position:0%
passed and that the Senate just slightly
 
00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:11.080 align:start position:0%
changed and passed and that we're going
 
00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
to concur
 
00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
on okay so seeing no other comments the
 
00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:23.360 align:start position:0%

there's no
 
00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
objection awesome so the um last order
 
00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
business we have is s SP 527 um relative
 
00:26:59.110 --> 00:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
to student housing um the committee
 
00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
heard testimony on a non- gerine
 
00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment a couple weeks ago after the
 
00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
public hearing on that um representative
 
00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:08.480 align:start position:0%
Reed I will recognize representative
 
00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
Reed for a motion thank you Mr chair I
 
00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:16.360 align:start position:0%
would like to move uh amendment number
 
00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:17.909 align:start position:0%
would like to move uh amendment number
1752

00:27:17.909 --> 00:27:17.919 align:start position:0%
1752
 
00:27:21.149 --> 00:27:21.159 align:start position:0%
and I'll second that thank you um and I
 
00:27:24.269 --> 00:27:24.279 align:start position:0%
would speak to that go ahead um so we
 
00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:26.120 align:start position:0%
had a hearing on a non- gerain amendment
 
00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
to address the issue as the chair just
 
00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:29.960 align:start position:0%
said to address the issue of
 
00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
occupancy um and that Amendment
 
00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:35.440 align:start position:0%
completely replaced the committee the
 
00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
study committee on uh housing for
 
00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:40.360 align:start position:0%
students and it was my understanding
 
00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
that while that is definitely a great
 
00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
step in the right direction it's not a
 
00:27:45.669 --> 00:27:45.679 align:start position:0%
silver bullet there are other issues
 
00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
impacting student housing that still
 
00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:50.320 align:start position:0%
would remain to be studied and I thought
 
00:27:51.909 --> 00:27:51.919 align:start position:0%
that it would actually be more
 
00:27:54.269 --> 00:27:54.279 align:start position:0%
strategically helpful to combine them
 
00:27:56.269 --> 00:27:56.279 align:start position:0%
rather than replace if for no other
 
00:27:58.830 --> 00:27:58.840 align:start position:0%
reason then the Senate is more like to
 
00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
accept it if we're not taking out what
 
00:28:03.549 --> 00:28:03.559 align:start position:0%
they put in so for the amendment before
 
00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
you simply adds the language of the non-
 
00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:07.720 align:start position:0%
gerain amendment that we had the hearing
 
00:28:10.029 --> 00:28:10.039 align:start position:0%
on onto the bill which is a study
 
00:28:13.269 --> 00:28:13.279 align:start position:0%
committee rather than replacing
 
00:28:17.789 --> 00:28:17.799 align:start position:0%
it okay any other comments on this
 
00:28:20.029 --> 00:28:20.039 align:start position:0%
amendment okay is the show of hands okay
 
00:28:21.789 --> 00:28:21.799 align:start position:0%
for the amendment oh representative
 
00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
Walsh yeah um I guess I'll be consistent
 
00:28:27.549 --> 00:28:27.559 align:start position:0%
I won't be supporting this amendment um
 
00:28:29.509 --> 00:28:29.519 align:start position:0%
not so much for another study committee
 
00:28:32.269 --> 00:28:32.279 align:start position:0%
that we probably don't need either but
 
00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:35.200 align:start position:0%
but but on what what the remnants of
 
00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:38.720 align:start position:0%
1281 and what this does and I don't know
 
00:28:40.269 --> 00:28:40.279 align:start position:0%
I served a lot long time on a planning
 
00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
board and it's my understanding and
 
00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
understanding that the majority of the
 
00:28:46.909 --> 00:28:46.919 align:start position:0%
time ordinances are created when towns
 
00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
have an issue um in the words of my late
 
00:28:52.269 --> 00:28:52.279 align:start position:0%
Mentor chair of hooks of planning board
 
00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:54.760 align:start position:0%
for many years he said look I don't like
 
00:28:57.710 --> 00:28:57.720 align:start position:0%
rules either he said and and he said but
 
00:29:00.149 --> 00:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
if if everybody respected each other and
 
00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:01.880 align:start position:0%
each other's rights and property rights
 
00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't need any of them but that's
 
00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
not reality I look at this these are
 
00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:09.200 align:start position:0%
college towns for the most part that are
 
00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:11.960 align:start position:0%
doing this I wasn't there I don't know
 
00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
what kind of issues they have and and
 
00:29:17.269 --> 00:29:17.279 align:start position:0%
from what I heard at the hearing uh by
 
00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
preventing them from doing this we may
 
00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
get their issues back and I did not hear
 
00:29:22.909 --> 00:29:22.919 align:start position:0%
and actually I heard the contrary that
 
00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
this probably isn't going to do anything
 
00:29:28.909 --> 00:29:28.919 align:start position:0%
for improving College housing anywhere
 
00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
not for pricing not for availability
 
00:29:32.509 --> 00:29:32.519 align:start position:0%
because these are fixed numbers of
 
00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:35.720 align:start position:0%
students in most most cases I just
 
00:29:37.509 --> 00:29:37.519 align:start position:0%
ordinance are there for a reason it's
 
00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:39.080 align:start position:0%
that not every planning board and Zoning
 
00:29:41.509 --> 00:29:41.519 align:start position:0%
Board is nefarious they had issues they
 
00:29:43.029 --> 00:29:43.039 align:start position:0%
found a way to fix it and keep in mind
 
00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:45.440 align:start position:0%
this has been around since what was it
 
00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:49.720 align:start position:0%
1986 so for those reasons I just I just
 
00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
can't get into their issues without
 
00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
knowing why it's started in the first
 
00:29:55.710 --> 00:29:55.720 align:start position:0%
place thank you representative Reed
 
00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I do appreciate the
 
00:29:59.669 --> 00:29:59.679 align:start position:0%
concept that ordinances are there for a
 
00:30:03.029 --> 00:30:03.039 align:start position:0%
reason I think that we strive um at all
 
00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
levels of government to reach that
 
00:30:06.669 --> 00:30:06.679 align:start position:0%
balance and and the different levels of
 
00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:08.200 align:start position:0%
government are a type of checks and
 
00:30:11.029 --> 00:30:11.039 align:start position:0%
balance so this is an example of where
 
00:30:12.389 --> 00:30:12.399 align:start position:0%
the state is stepping in and saying that
 
00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:15.080 align:start position:0%
those ordinance are overly restrictive
 
00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
um which we've seen time and time again
 
00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
but yes uh ordinances pertaining to
 
00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:24.120 align:start position:0%
Behavior where it as um as the concept
 
00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:26.480 align:start position:0%
is not respecting each other things like
 
00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
loud Behavior or garbage those
 
00:30:32.029 --> 00:30:32.039 align:start position:0%
ordinances are untouched and I think the
 
00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
point of the amendment as we had the
 
00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:36.440 align:start position:0%
hearing on is that we can have
 
00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:38.440 align:start position:0%
ordinances about Behavior without
 
00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:41.640 align:start position:0%
discriminating against a type of person
 
00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:44.120 align:start position:0%
um and there's really no reason to say
 
00:30:47.149 --> 00:30:47.159 align:start position:0%
that students specifically or renters
 
00:30:50.269 --> 00:30:50.279 align:start position:0%
specifically should have um restrictions
 
00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:52.600 align:start position:0%
that other people don't have if it's a
 
00:30:53.789 --> 00:30:53.799 align:start position:0%
if it's a behavior problem those
 
00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:56.360 align:start position:0%
ordinances are allowed so I will support
 
00:30:59.110 --> 00:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
the amendment obviously
 
00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:00.590 align:start position:0%
the amendment obviously
represent

00:31:00.590 --> 00:31:00.600 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:31:03.669 --> 00:31:03.679 align:start position:0%
call thank you
 
00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
um I think that kind of I have to agree
 
00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
with um the
 
00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:14.440 align:start position:0%
representative uh that this is really
 
00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
about discrimination that this is about
 
00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
inappropriate discrimination of of
 
00:31:28.549 --> 00:31:28.559 align:start position:0%
people and not an actual harm being
 
00:31:33.789 --> 00:31:33.799 align:start position:0%
uh perpetrated on the neighborhood or um
 
00:31:36.629 --> 00:31:36.639 align:start position:0%
safety it is
 
00:31:39.909 --> 00:31:39.919 align:start position:0%
essentially uh that that those those
 
00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
ordinances were placed I think on the
 
00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:44.830 align:start position:0%
ordinances were placed I think on the
books

00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
books
 
00:31:51.509 --> 00:31:51.519 align:start position:0%
for uh I saw an email that came out
 
00:31:55.269 --> 00:31:55.279 align:start position:0%
um that was forwarded regarding this
 
00:31:58.310 --> 00:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
bill that municipalities don't want to
 
00:32:00.789 --> 00:32:00.799 align:start position:0%
enforce these noise noise
 
00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:04.360 align:start position:0%
ordinances or um they're not cracking
 
00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
down on that and I think that a single
 
00:32:12.389 --> 00:32:12.399 align:start position:0%
person uh living in in their own house
 
00:32:16.629 --> 00:32:16.639 align:start position:0%
uh by themselves can be loud I know
 
00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
because I've had the cops called on me
 
00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:21.880 align:start position:0%
for being loud because I fell asleep
 
00:32:25.870 --> 00:32:25.880 align:start position:0%
while watching TV and it was so loud
 
00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:28.240 align:start position:0%
that the neighbors can hear it
 
00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
I felt I was sleeping fine and so I
 
00:32:33.509 --> 00:32:33.519 align:start position:0%
think that they were mad about that
 
00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
situation and there was no one there
 
00:32:39.149 --> 00:32:39.159 align:start position:0%
except for me and so um I think that if
 
00:32:40.629 --> 00:32:40.639 align:start position:0%
there's a problem with noise if there's
 
00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:42.360 align:start position:0%
a problem trash then they need to
 
00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:45.240 align:start position:0%
address that um you know through the
 
00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
health and safety type of uh situation
 
00:32:51.549 --> 00:32:51.559 align:start position:0%
but if you know if my girlfriend is
 
00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
there and we're not married or we are
 
00:32:57.629 --> 00:32:57.639 align:start position:0%
married that doesn't make us any more or
 
00:33:01.509 --> 00:33:01.519 align:start position:0%
less less safe um I think that is uh you
 
00:33:05.269 --> 00:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
know just uh they're trying to capture
 
00:33:09.269 --> 00:33:09.279 align:start position:0%
some thing uh by regulating something
 
00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:12.440 align:start position:0%
else and I think that um just because it
 
00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:15.240 align:start position:0%
may be hard to you know enforce nor
 
00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:17.320 align:start position:0%
ordinances at a certain time of day or
 
00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
something like that that doesn't make uh
 
00:33:21.549 --> 00:33:21.559 align:start position:0%
it appropriate for them to discriminate
 
00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
in a different way to try and alleviate
 
00:33:26.909 --> 00:33:26.919 align:start position:0%
those issues so I will be supporting the
 
00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:28.840 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you
 
00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:30.470 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you
represent

00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:33:33.669 --> 00:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
M thank you um I I must have missed a
 
00:33:37.509 --> 00:33:37.519 align:start position:0%
meeting or one of these uh work sessions
 
00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:40.200 align:start position:0%
we had so I apologize I'm looking at the
 
00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:41.230 align:start position:0%
we had so I apologize I'm looking at the
amended

00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:41.240 align:start position:0%
amended
 
00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:43.480 align:start position:0%
analysis uh Bill includes student
 
00:33:47.149 --> 00:33:47.159 align:start position:0%
housing and Municipal Workforce housing
 
00:33:49.789 --> 00:33:49.799 align:start position:0%
regulations so there's a definition for
 
00:33:52.389 --> 00:33:52.399 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing and this is adding
 
00:33:56.350 --> 00:33:56.360 align:start position:0%
this category in am I wrong about
 
00:33:58.269 --> 00:33:58.279 align:start position:0%
that I think
 
00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
addressing the bill as underlying bill I
 
00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:03.200 align:start position:0%
believe not I'm just going to your
 
00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:05.320 align:start position:0%
amended analysis on the back but the
 
00:34:08.669 --> 00:34:08.679 align:start position:0%
amended analysis still in incorporates
 
00:34:10.389 --> 00:34:10.399 align:start position:0%
it's not an analysis of the amendment
 
00:34:12.669 --> 00:34:12.679 align:start position:0%
the amended analysis analyzes the entire
 
00:34:15.589 --> 00:34:15.599 align:start position:0%
Bill if should it be adopted with the
 
00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
amendment so it's still speaking to the
 
00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
underlying bill there's nothing in the
 
00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:23.240 align:start position:0%
amendment that talks about that but my
 
00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
point is the bill does address that you
 
00:34:28.149 --> 00:34:28.159 align:start position:0%
you're adding an amendment to to that
 
00:34:31.389 --> 00:34:31.399 align:start position:0%
that's the amendment that's before me
 
00:34:37.470 --> 00:34:37.480 align:start position:0%
and the um is based on um family
 
00:34:39.990 --> 00:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
non-family relationships m s among the
 
00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:41.919 align:start position:0%
occupants property restricts the number
 
00:34:44.669 --> 00:34:44.679 align:start position:0%
of occupants of a single bedroom to less
 
00:34:44.679 --> 00:34:47.829 align:start position:0%
of occupants of a single bedroom to less
than

00:34:47.829 --> 00:34:47.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:51.480 align:start position:0%
two that means one person in only only
 
00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:54.520 align:start position:0%
every bedroom in this building can only
 
00:34:58.030 --> 00:34:58.040 align:start position:0%
have one person is that what what I'm
 
00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
reading here simple I'm a simple guy is
 
00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:02.320 align:start position:0%
that what I'm reading the cor so I'm as
 
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
a co-sponsor of the original bill that
 
00:35:06.829 --> 00:35:06.839 align:start position:0%
was heard in Municipal killed and then
 
00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:08.800 align:start position:0%
came forward as a non-gain Amendment
 
00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
which now this is the same Amendment but
 
00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
including the original Bill instead of
 
00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
replacing I will speak to the I spoke in
 
00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:18.640 align:start position:0%
that in that hearing um so the issue is
 
00:35:22.069 --> 00:35:22.079 align:start position:0%
we have a number of towns um Durham is
 
00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:25.720 align:start position:0%
the like the number one town that spoke
 
00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:29.440 align:start position:0%
um that say that they will not allow uh
 
00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
unrel more than three unrelated people
 
00:35:35.589 --> 00:35:35.599 align:start position:0%
in a a house regardless of the number of
 
00:35:39.109 --> 00:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
bedrooms and what this is saying is that
 
00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
at least a town has to allow couples
 
00:35:44.349 --> 00:35:44.359 align:start position:0%
pered one couple per bedroom that's not
 
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
what this says it says less than two
 
00:35:49.309 --> 00:35:49.319 align:start position:0%
what number shall not restrict to less
 
00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
than two
 
00:35:53.309 --> 00:35:53.319 align:start position:0%
right space restricts the number of
 
00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
occupants of a single bedroom to less to
 
00:36:00.349 --> 00:36:00.359 align:start position:0%
less than two which means one line
 
00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:04.200 align:start position:0%
16 right line 11 shall not adopt line 11
 
00:36:07.309 --> 00:36:07.319 align:start position:0%
shall not adopt any of the following
 
00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:09.160 align:start position:0%
which is anything that restricts the
 
00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
number of documents to a single of a
 
00:36:12.309 --> 00:36:12.319 align:start position:0%
single bedroom to less than two so it
 
00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
cannot say that you can only have one
 
00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:19.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:22.750 --> 00:36:22.760 align:start position:0%
16 yeah line 11 so that's one and two
 
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
those numbers one and two are part of
 
00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
that list the thing that's defining the
 
00:36:29.589 --> 00:36:29.599 align:start position:0%
list is in the the paragraph above
 
00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
it in its exercise of the powers granted
 
00:36:34.109 --> 00:36:34.119 align:start position:0%
under this subdivision the legislative
 
00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:35.800 align:start position:0%
body of a city Town Village District or
 
00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
county in which there are located in
 
00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
unincorporated towns or unorganized
 
00:36:42.829 --> 00:36:42.839 align:start position:0%
places shall not adopt nor shall the
 
00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
governing body thereof enforce any
 
00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:46.280 align:start position:0%
ordinance related to the occupancy of
 
00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:48.280 align:start position:0%
any existing new or single family duplex
 
00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
or multif family dwelling unit that one
 
00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
is based on familiar or non-familiar
 
00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:54.760 align:start position:0%
status two restricts the number of
 
00:36:58.230 --> 00:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
occupants per bedroom to less than two
 
00:37:02.069 --> 00:37:02.079 align:start position:0%
so so it shall not do one or two and it
 
00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:05.560 align:start position:0%
and in in in in the amendment it says
 
00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
that b says that they they can enforce
 
00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
the state building and fire code so um
 
00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
they can restrict it in cases of safety
 
00:37:16.309 --> 00:37:16.319 align:start position:0%
safety or or health
 
00:37:20.069 --> 00:37:20.079 align:start position:0%
yeah does that clarify your question I I
 
00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
understand your point I will not be
 
00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:24.550 align:start position:0%
understand your point I will not be
supporting

00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:24.560 align:start position:0%
supporting
 
00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
okay any other comments okay is the show
 
00:37:30.349 --> 00:37:30.359 align:start position:0%
of hands okay for the amendment I don't
 
00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
I don't know how they're going to enfor
 
00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
I I still don't get this line 16 what
 
00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
this means less than two to me says
 
00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:45.400 align:start position:0%
one go ahead represent Damon so if you
 
00:37:47.710 --> 00:37:47.720 align:start position:0%
read line
 
00:37:50.910 --> 00:37:50.920 align:start position:0%
11 and then read that as the beginning
 
00:37:53.589 --> 00:37:53.599 align:start position:0%
of the sentence that continues with line
 
00:37:56.829 --> 00:37:56.839 align:start position:0%
16 what it's saying is that it shall not
 
00:37:57.990 --> 00:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
adopt a
 
00:38:00.069 --> 00:38:00.079 align:start position:0%
restriction of the number of occupants
 
00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
of a single bedroom to less than two so
 
00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
in other words it is permitting at least
 
00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:07.240 align:start position:0%
two residents per
 
00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:09.800 align:start position:0%
bedroom to be fair you could have they
 
00:38:11.829 --> 00:38:11.839 align:start position:0%
could have rewarded that to say shall
 
00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:15.680 align:start position:0%
not restrict it to only one they just
 
00:38:17.309 --> 00:38:17.319 align:start position:0%
worded it differently to less than two
 
00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
less than two means
 
00:38:21.829 --> 00:38:21.839 align:start position:0%
one doesn't mean one and a half or yeah
 
00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
or a half represent Murray uh uh thank
 
00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um so I guess one other
 
00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
question that I did have when you're
 
00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:30.720 align:start position:0%
talking about not less than two if there
 
00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
were some other need like a health need
 
00:38:35.550 --> 00:38:35.560 align:start position:0%
or a reason for them to be somebody to
 
00:38:37.309 --> 00:38:37.319 align:start position:0%
have a single room that would be
 
00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:43.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
hearing represent V
 
00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
colum um I I think you I I think um that
 
00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:54.440 align:start position:0%
question is essentially like if a person
 
00:38:57.270 --> 00:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
chose to have their their occupancy of
 
00:38:59.150 --> 00:38:59.160 align:start position:0%
being being one bedroom but this is
 
00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
talking about the zoning saying the
 
00:39:04.430 --> 00:39:04.440 align:start position:0%
entire town essentially you cannot have
 
00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
you know if you have a two-bedroom house
 
00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:09.640 align:start position:0%
you cannot have more than three people
 
00:39:13.829 --> 00:39:13.839 align:start position:0%
in your house or because this is this is
 
00:39:17.109 --> 00:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
um just um occupants of a single bedroom
 
00:39:19.309 --> 00:39:19.319 align:start position:0%
right and so if they make a blanket
 
00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:21.200 align:start position:0%
statement of you have a three-bedroom
 
00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
house and you can only have four people
 
00:39:26.069 --> 00:39:26.079 align:start position:0%
in the house then that would essentially
 
00:39:29.109 --> 00:39:29.119 align:start position:0%
be in contrast in in contradictory to
 
00:39:33.309 --> 00:39:33.319 align:start position:0%
this law because that is less than two
 
00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:35.960 align:start position:0%
per bedroom and so that would not be
 
00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:38.720 align:start position:0%
enforcable however you could choose to
 
00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
obviously inhabit a a three-bedroom
 
00:39:43.589 --> 00:39:43.599 align:start position:0%
house with only one person if you wanted
 
00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:46.520 align:start position:0%
to they just wouldn't be able to mandate
 
00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
it represent re I thank you again and
 
00:39:53.550 --> 00:39:53.560 align:start position:0%
just very briefly I think ideally we
 
00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
would say something like if you're going
 
00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
to have uh restrictions that the
 
00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:00.200 align:start position:0%
restrictions can only refer to like
 
00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
State Building Code or fire code it has
 
00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:03.720 align:start position:0%
to be if it's for you can't discriminate
 
00:40:06.829 --> 00:40:06.839 align:start position:0%
based on renter or student or whatever
 
00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
but they it still allows that it just
 
00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:11.480 align:start position:0%
says that you can't discriminate and
 
00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
restrict it to under two so it still
 
00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
allows that so if the occupancy of a
 
00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:17.640 align:start position:0%
house is
 
00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:19.960 align:start position:0%
10 they could still restrict it as long
 
00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
as it wasn't less than two and wasn't
 
00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
based on familial status so I think we
 
00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:26.240 align:start position:0%
still give the municipalities lots of
 
00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
room to kind of get in there and and see
 
00:40:31.309 --> 00:40:31.319 align:start position:0%
what's best for them but I think this is
 
00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:33.880 align:start position:0%
a bare minimum that we that should be
 
00:40:35.990 --> 00:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
allowed represent
 
00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
WS last for me as I said I'm not going
 
00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
to be supporting it but I I just wanted
 
00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:43.160 align:start position:0%
to comment on this being discriminatory
 
00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
and and I
 
00:40:47.069 --> 00:40:47.079 align:start position:0%
disagree uh this was challenged in court
 
00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
if I'm not mistaken and I think if it
 
00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:52.680 align:start position:0%
was uh found discriminatory in any way I
 
00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
don't think it would have survived uh
 
00:40:58.270 --> 00:40:58.280 align:start position:0%
but it did so thank you
 
00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
very briefly please very briefly I
 
00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate that the definition in law of
 
00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
discrimination has to do with certain
 
00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
protected classes and whether or not
 
00:41:08.589 --> 00:41:08.599 align:start position:0%
you're enrolled in school is not one of
 
00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
those classes how and so therefore it
 
00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
makes sense that the court case came the
 
00:41:14.309 --> 00:41:14.319 align:start position:0%
way it did but we heard repeated
 
00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
testimony from people from Durham
 
00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
specifically saying This was meant in
 
00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
all of their ways whether it was rental
 
00:41:21.790 --> 00:41:21.800 align:start position:0%
term or what have you all other ways
 
00:41:23.870 --> 00:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
they were specifically trying to Target
 
00:41:27.589 --> 00:41:27.599 align:start position:0%
students they said that so you can say
 
00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
it's not discrimination legally but I
 
00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:31.240 align:start position:0%
think all of us know that it's targeting
 
00:41:34.270 --> 00:41:34.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:37.829 --> 00:41:37.839 align:start position:0%
person represent makoni thank you lastly
 
00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:39.400 align:start position:0%
and I don't think you need my vote on
 
00:41:43.349 --> 00:41:43.359 align:start position:0%
this and you're not getting it the um we
 
00:41:45.550 --> 00:41:45.560 align:start position:0%
have a hard enough time sitting here
 
00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
trying to focus and and be able with a
 
00:41:50.589 --> 00:41:50.599 align:start position:0%
straight face say what is Workforce
 
00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:52.720 align:start position:0%
housing I mean it's the hardest thing
 
00:41:53.950 --> 00:41:53.960 align:start position:0%
I'm going through in my county and
 
00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
everything else and here we open up
 
00:41:59.750 --> 00:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
another another student housing in
 
00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
Municipal Workforce housing and I think
 
00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:04.720 align:start position:0%
that makes it difficult to create
 
00:42:06.750 --> 00:42:06.760 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing so and and
 
00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:08.800 align:start position:0%
representative to address that I believe
 
00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
the um the reason why it says in
 
00:42:14.910 --> 00:42:14.920 align:start position:0%
Municipal Workforce housing regulations
 
00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
because that's the RSA they put it in
 
00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:19.880 align:start position:0%
but the underlying Bill 527 is merely a
 
00:42:22.309 --> 00:42:22.319 align:start position:0%
study committee to look into this and
 
00:42:24.750 --> 00:42:24.760 align:start position:0%
then the non- derain amendment is just
 
00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
tacked onto the study committee so I
 
00:42:28.109 --> 00:42:28.119 align:start position:0%
understand where you're coming from but
 
00:42:30.589 --> 00:42:30.599 align:start position:0%
it's not the reason why they did is
 
00:42:33.870 --> 00:42:33.880 align:start position:0%
because it's in the r in that RSA so um
 
00:42:35.230 --> 00:42:35.240 align:start position:0%
I mean the study committee will come up
 
00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:37.240 align:start position:0%
with what they come up with um but I
 
00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:40.040 align:start position:0%
think that the Crux of this is the non-
 
00:42:41.470 --> 00:42:41.480 align:start position:0%
derain amendment which I think is a
 
00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
valuable step in the right direction
 
00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
thank you okay okay are we ready or yeah
 
00:42:49.470 --> 00:42:49.480 align:start position:0%
I'm just GNA say uh seeing it is just a
 
00:42:51.309 --> 00:42:51.319 align:start position:0%
study committee I think I'll let it you
 
00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
know vote for it to go forward and let
 
00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
the study committee work out any other
 
00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:59.109 align:start position:0%
the study committee work out any other
details

00:42:59.109 --> 00:42:59.119 align:start position:0%
details
 
00:43:00.750 --> 00:43:00.760 align:start position:0%
just point of word I mean point of
 
00:43:03.549 --> 00:43:03.559 align:start position:0%
clarification if I may Mr chair it is
 
00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
not just a study committee with a nerain
 
00:43:07.630 --> 00:43:07.640 align:start position:0%
Amendment attached to it correct there
 
00:43:09.109 --> 00:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
is another underlying Bill the
 
00:43:11.589 --> 00:43:11.599 align:start position:0%
underlying bill is the study committee
 
00:43:16.109 --> 00:43:16.119 align:start position:0%
yeah and then this adds that portion on
 
00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
yes this is unrelated adds the unrelated
 
00:43:22.109 --> 00:43:22.119 align:start position:0%
renters or ordinance but it's not
 
00:43:25.309 --> 00:43:25.319 align:start position:0%
related it's it's vaguely related in
 
00:43:27.790 --> 00:43:27.800 align:start position:0%
that the study committee is on student
 
00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:29.720 align:start position:0%
housing how to deal with housing with
 
00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
for students and we had a bill in
 
00:43:35.109 --> 00:43:35.119 align:start position:0%
Municipal that addressed that in this
 
00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
one area because towns were making it
 
00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
difficult for students to get
 
00:43:41.349 --> 00:43:41.359 align:start position:0%
housing go ahead represent Wallace if I
 
00:43:43.950 --> 00:43:43.960 align:start position:0%
may the uh the study committee is the
 
00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:48.280 align:start position:0%
transport vehicle if you will for this
 
00:43:51.309 --> 00:43:51.319 align:start position:0%
reform I have a question um Repro for
 
00:43:53.950 --> 00:43:53.960 align:start position:0%
representative Reed um representative
 
00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
Reed when
 
00:43:59.510 --> 00:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
you for the original bill was there any
 
00:44:03.069 --> 00:44:03.079 align:start position:0%
discussion during um committee
 
00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:10.440 align:start position:0%
commercial in the hearing I thought
 
00:44:12.430 --> 00:44:12.440 align:start position:0%
maybe you were present for the hearing
 
00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
um so I don't remember maybe other
 
00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:15.960 align:start position:0%
members of the committee who were
 
00:44:18.309 --> 00:44:18.319 align:start position:0%
present for the hearing I was but I I
 
00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
did specifically ask the representative
 
00:44:22.190 --> 00:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
for uh the senator who's the Prime
 
00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:25.640 align:start position:0%
sponsor on the underlying Bill if uh at
 
00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:27.640 align:start position:0%
the time she was testifying against
 
00:44:29.950 --> 00:44:29.960 align:start position:0%
adding that non-gain Amendment and I
 
00:44:32.309 --> 00:44:32.319 align:start position:0%
asked her would the senator be okay with
 
00:44:33.950 --> 00:44:33.960 align:start position:0%
us adding the language rather than
 
00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
replacing her underlying bill and I I
 
00:44:38.349 --> 00:44:38.359 align:start position:0%
took it her answer to mean that that
 
00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:44:42.990 --> 00:44:43.000 align:start position:0%
fine so followup please so this bill
 
00:44:46.030 --> 00:44:46.040 align:start position:0%
that I'm asking you about wasn't that
 
00:44:49.109 --> 00:44:49.119 align:start position:0%
the bill that was originally in um
 
00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
Municipal and county in the house yes
 
00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:53.400 align:start position:0%
and we have a member who serves on
 
00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:54.880 align:start position:0%
Municipal who might be able to answer
 
00:44:57.549 --> 00:44:57.559 align:start position:0%
more questions okay
 
00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
and who is that represent go ahead thank
 
00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:01.790 align:start position:0%
and who is that represent go ahead thank
you

00:45:01.790 --> 00:45:01.800 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:45:06.069 --> 00:45:06.079 align:start position:0%
um the so this amendment is technically
 
00:45:08.549 --> 00:45:08.559 align:start position:0%
not the exact same bill it's the same
 
00:45:11.589 --> 00:45:11.599 align:start position:0%
subject matter but the wording is
 
00:45:11.599 --> 00:45:14.309 align:start position:0%
subject matter but the wording is
changed

00:45:14.309 --> 00:45:14.319 align:start position:0%
changed
 
00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
um uh there was not a list all of that
 
00:45:19.710 --> 00:45:19.720 align:start position:0%
kind of stuff and and in that hearing we
 
00:45:23.230 --> 00:45:23.240 align:start position:0%
did not discuss uh the commercial aspect
 
00:45:27.470 --> 00:45:27.480 align:start position:0%
of um student housing it was mainly
 
00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:28.720 align:start position:0%
about the
 
00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
Discrimination um and whether or not you
 
00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:34.109 align:start position:0%
Discrimination um and whether or not you
know

00:45:34.109 --> 00:45:34.119 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:38.480 align:start position:0%
people people next door or uh should be
 
00:45:42.109 --> 00:45:42.119 align:start position:0%
able to control how many how many uh how
 
00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
many nonrelated people are in a in a
 
00:45:49.790 --> 00:45:49.800 align:start position:0%
building and then also regarding uh you
 
00:45:53.710 --> 00:45:53.720 align:start position:0%
know is that a safety issue um and and
 
00:45:56.190 --> 00:45:56.200 align:start position:0%
stuff like that we didn't go into into
 
00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:57.589 align:start position:0%
stuff like that we didn't go into into
uh

00:45:57.589 --> 00:45:57.599 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:45:59.910 --> 00:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
commercial aspect thank you may follow
 
00:46:03.349 --> 00:46:03.359 align:start position:0%
up ahe so what my thinking is that um I
 
00:46:06.190 --> 00:46:06.200 align:start position:0%
did some research and um I looked at the
 
00:46:09.790 --> 00:46:09.800 align:start position:0%
um assesses database in uh for Duram at
 
00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:12.440 align:start position:0%
least and I noticed that some of the
 
00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:15.480 align:start position:0%
housing that's that's labeled student
 
00:46:19.150 --> 00:46:19.160 align:start position:0%
housing is coded a Zone
 
00:46:21.790 --> 00:46:21.800 align:start position:0%
commercial so let me follow up so my
 
00:46:23.630 --> 00:46:23.640 align:start position:0%
thought is that when you have people
 
00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:27.880 align:start position:0%
Behaving Badly um in different like
 
00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:31.240 align:start position:0%
buildings baras or whatever
 
00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:35.640 align:start position:0%
um the onus is on the commercial owner
 
00:46:38.030 --> 00:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
to get that you know Behavior cleaned up
 
00:46:42.910 --> 00:46:42.920 align:start position:0%
so that may be more um leverage for the
 
00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
towns people who are offended by the
 
00:46:47.030 --> 00:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
behavior of the students um so I mean
 
00:46:48.910 --> 00:46:48.920 align:start position:0%
that's another way to think of that
 
00:46:52.309 --> 00:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
thank you represent Reed I would just
 
00:46:55.670 --> 00:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
add to that if that's is accurate that
 
00:46:57.430 --> 00:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
um that kind of
 
00:46:58.790 --> 00:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
brings into question some of the
 
00:47:00.750 --> 00:47:00.760 align:start position:0%
complaints about ruining residential
 
00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods if they're actually in
 
00:47:03.829 --> 00:47:03.839 align:start position:0%
commercial zones to begin with then what
 
00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
residential neighborhoods are you
 
00:47:06.910 --> 00:47:06.920 align:start position:0%
ruining but I will say that we have to
 
00:47:09.270 --> 00:47:09.280 align:start position:0%
kind of deal with what we have today and
 
00:47:10.910 --> 00:47:10.920 align:start position:0%
I don't know about deadlines and stuff
 
00:47:13.549 --> 00:47:13.559 align:start position:0%
but we're rapidly running out of time
 
00:47:15.230 --> 00:47:15.240 align:start position:0%
this this amendment I I feel is
 
00:47:17.710 --> 00:47:17.720 align:start position:0%
completely reasonable um and the study
 
00:47:18.990 --> 00:47:19.000 align:start position:0%
committee on student housing will look
 
00:47:20.309 --> 00:47:20.319 align:start position:0%
further into that issue that you just
 
00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
raised excellent thank you okay are we
 
00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
all set to vote okay is it
 
00:47:27.109 --> 00:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
representative walls yes just I am
 
00:47:28.349 --> 00:47:28.359 align:start position:0%
understand we we're all it's all late
 
00:47:30.069 --> 00:47:30.079 align:start position:0%
but to address your question there are
 
00:47:31.950 --> 00:47:31.960 align:start position:0%
many places in throughout the state
 
00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
where there are existing Residential
 
00:47:35.549 --> 00:47:35.559 align:start position:0%
Properties in zones that are now
 
00:47:37.829 --> 00:47:37.839 align:start position:0%
commercial if those properties were
 
00:47:40.510 --> 00:47:40.520 align:start position:0%
resid cease to be residential for a year
 
00:47:43.069 --> 00:47:43.079 align:start position:0%
and a day they can no longer be occupied
 
00:47:45.309 --> 00:47:45.319 align:start position:0%
as residential they would they would
 
00:47:48.030 --> 00:47:48.040 align:start position:0%
they would Decay to a uh commercial oh
 
00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
good information sry represent W go
 
00:47:53.069 --> 00:47:53.079 align:start position:0%
ahead well there's also plenty of other
 
00:47:55.589 --> 00:47:55.599 align:start position:0%
places that commercial does allow
 
00:47:57.349 --> 00:47:57.359 align:start position:0%
residential components
 
00:47:59.069 --> 00:47:59.079 align:start position:0%
uh it doesn't have to be changed uh
 
00:48:01.549 --> 00:48:01.559 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of mobile home parks for
 
00:48:04.430 --> 00:48:04.440 align:start position:0%
another one are allowed in commercial
 
00:48:08.750 --> 00:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
zones so uh the testimony we heard is
 
00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
that the student housing is basically
 
00:48:12.349 --> 00:48:12.359 align:start position:0%
available for the majority of the town
 
00:48:14.390 --> 00:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
around the college itself and that this
 
00:48:15.910 --> 00:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
ordinance actually just starts to get
 
00:48:17.950 --> 00:48:17.960 align:start position:0%
applied as you get towards the outskirts
 
00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:23.069 --> 00:48:23.079 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods uh thank you Mr chair
 
00:48:26.349 --> 00:48:26.359 align:start position:0%
there are also mixed use zoned items as
 
00:48:27.710 --> 00:48:27.720 align:start position:0%
well so can be commercial and
 
00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
residential together so there are
 
00:48:32.109 --> 00:48:32.119 align:start position:0%
there's that caveat as
 
00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:34.640 align:start position:0%
well all right all those in favor of the
 
00:48:37.390 --> 00:48:37.400 align:start position:0%
amendment please raise your
 
00:48:39.630 --> 00:48:39.640 align:start position:0%
hand those
 
00:48:41.829 --> 00:48:41.839 align:start position:0%
opposed okay so the motion car the
 
00:48:43.349 --> 00:48:43.359 align:start position:0%
amendment carries 8 to two is there
 
00:48:47.630 --> 00:48:47.640 align:start position:0%
another motion uh so we had to move out
 
00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
to pass first before but I don't think
 
00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
we did did we move out to pass first the
 
00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
amendment was approved no but you have
 
00:48:55.030 --> 00:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
to actually move out to pass then
 
00:48:56.870 --> 00:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
approve an amendment and then this
 
00:48:58.589 --> 00:48:58.599 align:start position:0%
motion is ought to pass is amended
