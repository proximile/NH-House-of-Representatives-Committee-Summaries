54
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Thank you.

55
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Thank you.

56
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Thank you.

57
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000

58
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Thank you.

59
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Thank you.

60
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Thank you.

61
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Thank you.

62
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Thank you.

63
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Thank you.

64
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I have a couple notes for these bills that are in the clerk's office, and we are arranging to get them delivered.

65
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:29.000
And next Tuesday, the House Committee Services is having a going-away due for Heather at the Upham Walker House, and we are all invited.

66
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
So, if you interested in attending, please do.

67
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Anything else?

68
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:50.500
Okay, in that case, I'm going to open the I represent Hillsboro 39 which is Ward 6 8 and 9 in Manchester hospital 250 FN is just a very simple bill.

69
00:02:50.500 --> 00:03:00.000
It's just going from 50% to 100% of the annual earned compensation for the death benefit for a firefighter.

70
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
You might think that's a big jump, but it's not.

71
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.500
This is only catching up.

72
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:15.500
Right now, if I was a firefighter and I retired, I'd get 100% of my benefit.

73
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:25.000
But if I got killed in a line of duty, my spouse or my family would only get 50%.

74
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:32.500
So they're penalizing me 50% for working and getting killed in a line of duty.

75
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:40.000
This is only a fairness thing, and I just think it's pretty simple and straightforward.

76
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.500
I think that's about enough to say.

77
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.500
It's a fairness thing.

78
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.500
I'll take any questions.

79
00:03:47.500 --> 00:04:35.500
Thank Broody I don't see that this is necessarily line of duty death isn't it all accidental deaths while in service well in service right well they're like if they're on there If someone were to be on vacation and got killed in an automobile accident they would still get this benefit correct well they should yeah okay thank you i just want to be clear other questions all right don't see any others thank you very much okay thank you and i'd like to call mark kavanaugh from the retirement system Thank you very much.

80
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.500
Okay.

81
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.500
Thank you.

82
00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:45.000
And I'd like to call Mark Cavanaugh from the Retirement System.

83
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Thank you, Madam Chair.

84
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.500
My name is Mark Cavanaugh.

85
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:55.500
I'm Associate Counsel and Compliance Officer for the New Hampshire Retirement System.

86
00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:01.000
I'd like to start just by clarifying what you just mentioned.

87
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.500
Accidental is a term of art under our statute.

88
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:12.000
It means a work-related death, not just an accident in a generic sense.

89
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:21.000
So yes, this bill is limited to people who die due to an accident at work while working.

90
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Requires a finding of compensability by the Workers' Comp Bureau before we can award our benefit.

91
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Okay, thank you.

92
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.500
Is there a death benefit for someone who dies?

93
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.000
Yes, that's called ordinary death.

94
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.500
If you have 10 years of service, you're a suspect of 50% annuity.

95
00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:49.000
Of course, if you're very young, that gets discounted.

96
00:05:49.000 --> 00:07:13.500
Or the option, if you don't have a spouse or if your spouse doesn't want to take the annuity, you get a return of your contribution account plus interest and one year's salary or one year's compensation as reported to us that's based the ordinary death is based on average final compensation accidental death for group two is based on the annual rate of compensation it's basically the same except we would not apply those limits on final year salary like the hundred and fifty percent rule the limit on compensation over base the limit on special duty that would apply in a normal service retirement those don't apply in the case of a group to accidental death it's merely the the annuity is based on whatever had been reported to us for the prior 12 months This benefit would this bill would increase that from a 50% of that amount to 100% of that amount I'd also like to say there are 26 people currently collecting this benefit.

97
00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:22.000
It's not a huge population There are 19 Widowers widows or widowers of firefighters and seven police.

98
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.500
Thank you for that data.

99
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.500
That's very helpful.

100
00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.500
Representative Schmidt and then Representative Dolan.

101
00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.500
Thank you very much, Madam Chair.

102
00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.500
Good morning, Mark.

103
00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:39.000
So you've been at this game for long enough.

104
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:51.000
You may remember when the death benefit was first under discussion before the legislature, something in the neighborhood of 16 years ago, I think.

105
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:57.500
And we looked at the cost of an insurance program and so forth.

106
00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:10.000
And we ultimately, we, the legislature, ultimately determined that we would be better off in terms of the probability of this benefit ever being collected.

107
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:20.000
We'd be better off by funding it out of the general fund in the instance in which it would occur.

108
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:31.500
So I'm wondering whether, because you're here to give us advice on the niceties and technicalities of the bill and of the situation.

109
00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:57.500
So it looks like this benefit would come out of the retirement system, unlike the death benefit that we said for police officers and I think firefighters that we put into statute early days, we've subsequently kind of incrementally expanded that to a wider population because it's still a very infrequent event.

110
00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:31.000
As you know, just last, I think, previous term, not last term, that this was going to be for our people who are working for the Department of Transportation, because many of them are doing hazardous things every time I drive along in the summertime, and seeing them mowing along and they're running their mower along on an angle like this, I'm thinking, what is keeping Dr.

111
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Dr.

112
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Newton, Isaac Newton, from pulling this person off that thing with a fatal outcome?

113
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.500
But anyway, they are very often very hazard oriented.

114
00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:47.500
Yes, Representative Schmidt, And your question?

115
00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:58.500
Well, the question is, we've expanded it, but would the benefit, if payable, come out of the retirement system in this instance?

116
00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:06.000
Yes, this would be a benefit payable out of the funds of the retirement system.

117
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:36.500
And the estimated increased cost of this bill is 1.3 million dollars that would have some downstream effect on employer rates very very low uh so low that we didn't bother to ask the actuary because it's de minimis in the scheme of our total assets but there is a little bit of a cost associated, comes out of our system.

118
00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.500
Thank you.

119
00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:41.500
That additional clarification is really helpful.

120
00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:43.500
Thank you.

121
00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:45.500
Yes.

122
00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:47.500
Representative Dolan.

123
00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:50.000
Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.

124
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.500
Thank you for taking, presenting your testimony.

125
00:10:53.500 --> 00:11:11.000
A question I have for our firefighters, for example, very easy to understand if they're fighting a fire and the house caves in on them and they die from that, that that's an accidental death.

126
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:24.500
How would you extend this benefit to, let's say, firefighters that use that firefighting foam that we know in the long term can have cancer causing results.

127
00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:29.500
Is that an accidental death or is that something else?

128
00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:40.500
Well, I'd like to use just for clarity, say work related, you know, so we don't have to focus just on accidental.

129
00:11:40.500 --> 00:12:02.000
The reason the word accidental is in there is historical because because our system paralleled workers' comp at a time years ago when something was compensable if you were hurt due to a particular accident that happened at work at a particular time.

130
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Since then, causation has been expanded to occupational injuries due to repetitive motion over time, occupational illnesses due to repetitive motion over time, occupational illnesses due to exposure to hazardous chemicals and the like.

131
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.500
We follow the determination of workers' comp.

132
00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:29.500
We don't make an individual evaluation as to whether something is work-related or not.

133
00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:37.000
If workers' comp has issued a finding of compensability, then that is binding on us.

134
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:46.000
And we recently had a case of a fire chief who was accidental death due to colon cancer.

135
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:53.500
So yes, it's in the realm, but the determination is primarily made by workers' compensation.

136
00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:55.500
Thank you, Madam Chair.

137
00:12:55.500 --> 00:13:03.500
I believe that in the case of firefighters, there's a statutory definition that cancer is work-related.

138
00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:11.000
There are certain presumptions under workers' comp law that apply to cancers and lung disease.

139
00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.500
But again, we don't do that part of it.

140
00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:42.500
We follow the lead of workers comp and the labor board thanks okay representative lacus thank you i'm just trying to understand the fiscal note so uh would this have any impact on the people that are currently collecting this annuity due to a prior accidental death, or is this all going to work?

141
00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:44.500
No.

142
00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:57.500
We read the statute as applying to deaths that occur after its effective date, and not a retroactive increase in benefits for those currently receiving one.

143
00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:59.500
Thank you.

144
00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:01.500
Okay.

145
00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:03.500
Other questions?

146
00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:05.500
Yes, Representative Bailey.

147
00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:07.500
Thank you.

148
00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:26.000
I perhaps don't know what I'm talking about, but the way group 2 was explained to me was that it was a pension, and then if the person being pensioned died, the survivor would get 50 percent.

149
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:33.500
Well, this would apply to persons who have not retired yet and die while active.

150
00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:45.500
So the benefit is that if you have a spouse, minor children, or dependent parents, in that order, they're entitled to this annuity benefit.

151
00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:51.500
They also, as I say, they also get a return his contributions.

152
00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:57.000
So this benefit is fully funded by the state annuity fund.

153
00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:05.000
We don't use the member contributions and interest from their member account to fund this benefit.

154
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:16.000
So in addition to this annuity, the spouse or the designated beneficiary would get a return of any accumulated contributions plus interest.

155
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
Follow-up?

156
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Follow-up.

157
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:30.000
So if I was in this group two and died, the day after I retired, my spouse would get 50%.

158
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000
It might take a little longer to process, but yeah.

159
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:42.500
If I died in the line of duty or something, my spouse would get 100%.

160
00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:44.500
Correct.

161
00:15:44.500 --> 00:16:40.500
And're and it doesn't say like it's gonna age out or anything it's no permanent it's for the rest of your life yeah the spouse so we'll have group two a and b um no it wouldn't change the groups it would just change the level of benefit based on when the death occurred before after the effective date of this statute thank you okay other uh representative true thank you madam chair and thank you for taking my question i'll go along with i don't know what i'm talking about and that's why i'm here you're saying it's going to cost like about a million dollars um who's paying for that?

162
00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:47.500
Well, it's $1.3 million at the local level and $320 at the state level.

163
00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:56.500
That is what the downstream increase in contributions would be due to having to fund the higher benefit.

164
00:16:56.500 --> 00:17:04.000
So there is no cost for 24 and 25 because we can't increase those rates.

165
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
They've already been set.

166
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:12.500
So the first time we can increase the rates would be in 26.

167
00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:25.000
And that's the annual cost going forward of funding the benefit, the increase in the benefit of 1.3 million and 320,000 at the state level.

168
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:38.000
Just like any increase in benefits, it can be terminally funded by an appropriation upfront of the present value of the future cost of that increase.

169
00:17:38.000 --> 00:18:02.000
increase or if it is not terminally funded then downstream those increased liabilities are going to be reflected in the the employer contribution rates follow up thank you thank you madam chair so the downstream or the local cost is for local government not not for the employees.

170
00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
Correct.

171
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.500
Contribution rates for members, employees, are fixed under statute.

172
00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:16.000
So if there's increased costs that affect contributions, it's going to affect the employer contributions.

173
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
Thank you.

174
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
Other questions?

175
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
Thank you, Madam Chair.

176
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:38.000
You used a term that those of us who have been here for a while are familiar with, but the new people may not know what it means to say terminally funded.

177
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.500
Could you speak to that?

178
00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:56.500
Terminally funded would be an appropriation from general funds to put up front and give to us the amount of money that would cover the future cost of the increase in benefits.

179
00:18:56.500 --> 00:19:04.500
So instead of there being a downstream increase in contributions, we'd get the money up front.

180
00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:09.000
And that's how sometimes coal is funded that way.

181
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000
Particularly, we'll talk about that one later today.

182
00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
Thank you.

183
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
Other questions?

184
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
All right.

185
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:33.500
one later today thank you other questions all right seeing none thank you mr cavanaugh you're welcome and uh brian rill Good morning, Madam Chair, members of the committee.

186
00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:37.500
For the record, my name is Brian Rill.

187
00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:43.500
I serve as the president of the Professional Firefighters of New Hampshire.

188
00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:51.000
We represent approximately 2,000 active and retired firefighters, paramedics, and dispatchers throughout the Granite State.

189
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:58.500
On behalf of the firefighters, we advocate for the health and safety of our members.

190
00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:18.000
And I just want to draw to your attention that just four miles from here where we sit today, on the grounds of the New Hampshire Fire Academy, there are four stone tablets with 92 names carved into them.

191
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:26.000
Those 92 names are those that made the ultimate sacrifice for the citizens of this state.

192
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:42.000
These heroes are remembered fondly every day by their family and their friends and they're honored every day by the firefighters that continue to get on the trucks and answer the call.

193
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:54.000
These are the very same firefighters who have to make it their duty to take care of the families of those that have fallen.

194
00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:19.000
These families that are left in the in a wake of a disaster so unimaginable that it turns their lives upside down are trying to mourn the loss of their loved one while also trying to figure out how to pay their mortgage, put gas in their car, buy groceries.

195
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:28.000
They're the very same families who supported their loved ones as they protected the citizens of this state.

196
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:43.000
Through many countless nights, weekends, and holidays, many times 24, 48 hours at a time, these families lay awake at night wondering if they'll ever see their loved one again.

197
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:49.000
And we have 92 families that never saw their loved one again.

198
00:21:49.000 --> 00:22:00.000
This is a very small change that was mentioned by those before me, and I think it's a fair change at that.

199
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:29.000
We can no longer sit back and allow the families of our fallen brothers and sisters to collect a mere 50 of their salary their compensation we ask that the committee fully support this small change and honor those that we've lost along the way i would be happy to entertain any questions you may have, Madam Chair.

200
00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000
Thank you, Mr.

201
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000
Rill.

202
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000
Are there questions?

203
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000
All right.

204
00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000
Seek done.

205
00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000
Thank you very much.

206
00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:46.000
Does anyone else wish to testify on House Bill 250?

207
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000
Mr.

208
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000
Beaudry.

209
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000
All right.

210
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:58.000
I've got a stack of them i'll look for it Yes, sir.

211
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000
Okay, thank you.

212
00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:07.000
Madam Chairman, members of the committee, for the record, my name is Arthur Beaudry.

213
00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:13.500
I am the president of the New Hampshire State Permanent Firefighters Retirement Association.

214
00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:25.000
I am a retired captain from the Manchester Fire Department and a past trustee of the New Hampshire retirement system for 13 years.

215
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.000
I am here today in support of House Bill 250.

216
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:55.500
I have been addressing the legislature for over 40 years on retirement issues, and it wasn't until last year when working on the ordinary death benefit that it was brought to our attention that the accidental death benefit annuity was only 50% of the deceased member's annual rate of earnable compensation.

217
00:23:55.500 --> 00:24:16.000
Under the ordinary death benefit language that passed last year, a member can sign a pre-option form, and if they have 20 years of service, their spouse can collect 100% of the member's annual rate of earnable compensation upon their death.

218
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:31.000
If a member gets injured in the line of duty and has to retire due to those injuries, that member would receive two-thirds of their annual rate of earnable compensation.

219
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:46.500
It only makes sense that if a member gives their ultimate sacrifice, their life, and the performance of their duty that their family should not be financially burdened by that loss.

220
00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:51.000
It is tough enough to lose a loved one.

221
00:24:51.000 --> 00:25:01.500
The least we can do is make sure that the family they leave behind doesn't have, also have to suffer financially.

222
00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:09.000
I ask you please to support House Bill 250 and I will answer any questions.

223
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000
Thank you.

224
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000
Are there any questions?

225
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000
Representative Schmidt.

226
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000
Thank you, Madam Chair.

227
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000
Good morning, Art.

228
00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.500
It seems like you're reading from a prepared remark.

229
00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:27.000
Can you provide that to the committee?

230
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000
I can.

231
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000
Thank you.

232
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000
Thank you, Representative.

233
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000
Other questions?

234
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000
Thank you.

235
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000
All right.

236
00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.500
Seeing none, thank you for your testimony.

237
00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:45.500
Does anyone else wish to testify?

238
00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:56.000
all right seeing none i will I will close the hearing, and we have a few minutes before the next one.

239
00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000
Very good.

240
00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000
All right.

241
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000
That's right.

242
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000
You're going to talk on more of them.

243
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000
That's right.

244
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000
No, sorry.

245
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.500
It was just buried under my stuff.

246
00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:15.500
under my stuff.

247
00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:17.500
Thank you.

248
00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:19.500
Thank you.

249
00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:21.500
Thank you.

250
00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:23.500
Thank you.

251
00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:25.500
Thank you.

252
00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:27.500
Thank you.

253
00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:29.500
Thank you.

254
00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:31.500
Thank you.

255
00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:33.500
Thank you.

256
00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:35.500
Thank you.

257
00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:37.500
Thank you.

258
00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:39.500
Thank you.

259
00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:41.500
Thank you.

260
00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:43.500
Thank you.

261
00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:45.500
Thank you.

262
00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:47.500
Thank you.

263
00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:49.500
Thank you.

264
00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:51.500
Thank you.

265
00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:53.500
Thank you.

266
00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:55.500
Thank you.

267
00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:57.500
Thank you.

268
00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:59.500
Thank you.

269
00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:01.500
Thank you.

270
00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:03.500
Welcome back.

271
00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:36.500
I'd like to mention that House Bill 250 is going to the Pension Subcommittee for further work and House Bill 571 will almost certainly go there as well i'm opening the hearing on house bill 571 and i'm calling representative berdy thank you madam chairman members of the committee i am still representative ben berruti from manchester representing hillsborough 39 manchester's Ward 6, 8, and 9.

272
00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:47.000
I brought this forward because, again, I think it's time that some of these retired people catch up a little bit.

273
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:56.000
Over the last, see, group two people, when they retire, this is all they get for retirement income.

274
00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:08.000
They don't get Social Security like most of the other people in this country yet, but this is all they have to live on.

275
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:13.500
So over the last 20 years, Social Security's gone up 64.5%.

276
00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:51.500
And if you retired 20 years ago as a firefighter you got 15 percent increase during that time so you lose a lot of buying power and so this is a an attempt to get them a little something um i don't know if it'll mean a heck of a lot to them because the cost of living today, people who retired 20 years ago weren't getting much as it is, but not getting any increases.

277
00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:54.000
They felt way, way behind.

278
00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:05.500
And I think this is just an attempt to let them know that we'll try to let them catch up a little bit.

279
00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:08.000
This is a two-phase thing.

280
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:14.500
You have to be retired 10 years to get an increase of 5%.

281
00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:16.500
10 years.

282
00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:49.000
Now, I don't know if anyone here has been retired and retired for 10 years, but just think of the additional income you got in the last 10 years from Social Security versus all we have for that 15% it's a big difference especially today the cost of living so I this is an attempt to do that there's no physical note on this this.

283
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:55.500
So I don't know how they're going to analyze it in the end.

284
00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:59.500
That information is making its way to us.

285
00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:04.000
We don't have it yet, but it's coming up.

286
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000
Yeah.

287
00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.500
So and that's basically it.

288
00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:12.000
And it's only on the first 50,000.

289
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:19.000
Now, if if you retired 20 years ago, you're probably not even making $50,000.

290
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.500
So you would get your whole increase.

291
00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:25.500
So that's what this bill does.

292
00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:29.000
I hope the committee can support it.

293
00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:36.500
Unlike the last bill, I don't know all the nuts and bolts about the numbers.

294
00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:48.000
So to avoid any curveballs, I know there's people behind me that have a lot more, as far as statistics go, and numbers.

295
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:54.500
And maybe they can answer a lot more technical questions than I can.

296
00:30:54.500 --> 00:31:01.500
I just brought this forward because I think it's the right thing to do.

297
00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:03.500
Thank you, Representative Baruti.

298
00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:05.500
Thank you.

299
00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:08.500
And'll take any questions from anybody.

300
00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:11.500
If I can answer, I'm fine.

301
00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:13.500
If not...

302
00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:17.000
I think you scared them all off.

303
00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000
Thank you.

304
00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.000
Oh, no.

305
00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.000
Now, Representative Dolan, go for it.

306
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000
Thank you.

307
00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000
Thank you for taking my question.

308
00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:38.000
Would this be funded out of local communities, or would this be funded out of the retirement fund?

309
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:46.000
I think this comes out of the general fund, out of the retirement general fund again.

310
00:31:46.000 --> 00:32:03.500
Without specific funding from the general fund, any cost of living increases get folded into the future payments by the employers, which in the case of group two is almost entirely local police and fire.

311
00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:05.500
Thank you.

312
00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:07.500
Representative Gerhard.

313
00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:09.500
Thank you, Madam Chair.

314
00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:18.500
This is a one-time increase, or is this continual as far as the cost of living goes up?

315
00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:23.500
No, no, once they get it, they'll continue getting it.

316
00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:28.000
I'm saying, does this track to, Madam Chair, follow-up?

317
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.500
Follow-up, no, it doesn't track to inflation.

318
00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:33.500
It's a one-time increase.

319
00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:36.000
Yeah, it's a one-time increase.

320
00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:41.500
Would it make more sense to just index this to inflation?

321
00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:44.500
I think that would be better.

322
00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:49.000
Yes, but it would cost a great deal more.

323
00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:55.500
Yeah, and that's why we did it this way, because of the cost.

324
00:32:55.500 --> 00:33:03.500
I mean, I would go along with it, but I don't know if the legislature would.

325
00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:06.000
Well, I mean, inflation's going.

326
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000
Exactly.

327
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000
Representative Shewitt.

328
00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000
Thank you, Madam Chair.

329
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:28.000
Representative Rudy, is it not true that there was a one-time payment made in the last session to state employees, but the limit was, I believe, $30,000, so it kind of excluded?

330
00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.500
I'm not sure of that.

331
00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:33.500
I think they did get one.

332
00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:36.000
I don't know when itION.

333
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000
IT WAS LAST SESSION.

334
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000
YES.

335
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000
THANK YOU.

336
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000
ANY OTHER?

337
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000
THANK YOU.

338
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000
NO?

339
00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000
VERY GOOD.

340
00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000
MR.

341
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000
KAVANAUGH?

342
00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000
THANK YOU.

343
00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:05.500
FOR THE RECORD, MARK KAVANAUGH, ASSOCIATE COUNSEL AND CO Counsel and Compliance Officer for the New Hampshire Retirement System.

344
00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:07.500
A couple of clarifications.

345
00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:23.000
This is a true COLA in that it is a permanent addition to the members' benefit going forward, as opposed to a temporary supplemental allowance, which is what happened last year.

346
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.500
It was a one-time payment.

347
00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:30.500
It didn't get added to their benefit for the future.

348
00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:32.500
It's a one-time calculation.

349
00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:40.500
It's not a COLA every year, but once it's added to your benefit, it continues on.

350
00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:51.000
It is also intended to be terminally funded from the general fund, And the of that would be 84.2 million dollars.

351
00:34:51.000 --> 00:35:01.500
This is a benefit that's for the group two only who meet the criteria of 10 or 20 years of service.

352
00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:18.000
There are 2100 group two retirees who have 10 years of service, and there are about 1600 who have 20 years of retirement, 20 years retired who will get the 10 percent COLA.

353
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:25.000
And again, 2100 who have 10 years retired who would get the 5% COLA.

354
00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.000
Okay, thank you.

355
00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.000
I'm hoping for questions.

356
00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:34.500
Very good, well, Representative Lekas has one to get you started.

357
00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:36.500
Thank you.

358
00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:46.500
Maybe I'm probably missing it, but where in here does it indicate this would be funded from the general fund?

359
00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:48.500
Lines 18 through 22.

360
00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:51.000
Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.

361
00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000
Yeah.

362
00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000
Okay, great.

363
00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000
Thank you.

364
00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.000
Representative Fitzpatrick.

365
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.000
Thank you, Madam Chair.

366
00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.500
Has this been done in the past?

367
00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:08.500
And if so, when was the last time?

368
00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:20.500
uh last time we had a permanent edition cola such as this it's before i worked here and i'll be 10 years in April.

369
00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:30.000
We've done the temporary one-time payments twice, three times in the last 10 years, but not even that many.

370
00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:36.500
It's expensive, and so usually it doesn't pass the bar, so to speak.

371
00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:40.000
Thank you, and thank you, Madam Chair.

372
00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000
Okay.

373
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000
Other questions?

374
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:53.000
I just want to confirm you said that there are 2,100 people who would qualify for this benefit.

375
00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.500
2,100 who would qualify for the 5%.

376
00:36:56.500 --> 00:37:03.000
So people have at least 10 but less than 20 years being retired.

377
00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:11.500
An additional 1,600 have more than 20 years since they retired and would qualify for the 10%.

378
00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:13.500
Thank you.

379
00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:18.500
at least 10 but less than 20 years being retired.

380
00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:27.000
An additional 1,600 have more than 20 years since they retired and we qualify for the 10%.

381
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000
Ah.

382
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.000
So.

383
00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.000
Thank you.

384
00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000
So 3,700 altogether.

385
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000
Okay.

386
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.000
Thank you.

387
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.500
That's good to know with the scope.

388
00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:44.500
Anyone else?

389
00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:46.500
Thank you.

390
00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:50.000
That's good to know with the scope.

391
00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000
Anyone else?

392
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000
Thank you.

393
00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.500
Seeing no others, thank you very much.

394
00:37:57.500 --> 00:37:59.500
Mr.

395
00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:01.500
Rill.

396
00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:05.500
Good morning, Madam Chair, members of the committee.

397
00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:09.000
Once again, my name is Brian Rill.

398
00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:15.000
I serve as the President of the Professional Firefighters of New Hampshire.

399
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:26.000
Professional Firefighters of New Hampshire is the state association that represents approximately 2,000 members and approximately 600 of those members are retirees.

400
00:38:26.000 --> 00:39:28.500
I'm here before you today to ask you to support house bill 571 and it is important to understand both the role that our retirees have in the strength of the local economy and the foundation it provides for the long-term growth of our state continuous focus on stimulating the local economy is necessary and important for this legislature especially during uncertain times expenditures made by retirees provide a steady economic stimulus for new hampshire and one that cannot be overstated in 2020 the national institute of retirement security measured the economic impact of defined benefit pension expenditures and determined that the state and local pensions paid out $848.9 million in benefits, while retiree expenditures represented $1.4 billion in total economic output in New Hampshire.

401
00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:44.500
So many state and municipal retirees dedicate their lives to a career in public service and contribute so much to our communities, yet many of them are forced to live in poverty.

402
00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:56.000
In fact, 93% of our retirees make less than $50,000 a year, while federal poverty line in New Hampshire is just under $44,000.

403
00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:02.000
The most jarring comparison is to that of the Consumer Price Index.

404
00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:39.500
In the last 20 years, the total inflation calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics surpassed 52 percent while retired firefighters received a mere 13 and a half percent in cost of living adjustments this legislature has done so many great things over the years some of which have been to provide retirees with a temporary supplemental allowance, including last year's, in order to try and bridge the gap and provide them with financial relief.

405
00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:46.500
However, Group 2 retirees often find themselves on the losing end of this deal.

406
00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:56.000
Since they are not eligible for Social Security benefits, many of them narrowly exceed the limits for retirement allowance.

407
00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:27.500
It's time for new hampshire to develop a sustainable cost of living adjustment for group two retirees that allow them to live long financially stable retirement and continue continue to contribute to our state's economy and i believe house bill 571 is that solution i would urge the committee's full support of this bill and i would entertain any questions you may have.

408
00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:29.500
Thank you.

409
00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:31.500
Are there questions?

410
00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:40.500
And isn't it a feature of a defined benefit retirement system that the benefit is, in fact, defined?

411
00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:42.500
And it doesn't increase?

412
00:41:42.500 --> 00:42:16.500
Well, yes, I mean, I would say the benefit is in fact defined and it doesn't increase well yes I mean I would say the benefit would be defined but I would also think that it would be incumbent upon our state legislature to make sure that we don't have group two employees who are unable to survive financially I see thank you thank you other questions none.

413
00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:18.500
Mr.

414
00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:20.500
Beaudry.

415
00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:28.000
Madam Chairman, members of the committee, again for the record, my name is Arthur Beaudry.

416
00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:34.500
I am the president of the New Hampshire State Permanent Firefighters Retirement Association.

417
00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:46.000
I am a retired captain of the Manchester Fire Department and a past trustee of the New Hampshire Retirement System for 13 years.

418
00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:59.500
I am here today in support of House Bill 571, which would grant a COLA to retirees who have been retired for over 10 to 20 years.

419
00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:08.000
For those of you who may not know the history of granting colas, here's a little background.

420
00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:19.500
And some of you that have been on this committee have heard this before, but I think it's important to say it again.

421
00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:37.500
Prior to the establishment of the special account in 1983 to fund cost of living adjustments, the cost of living cola was granted by the legislature and funded through the general fund from 1967 to 1983.

422
00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:47.000
From 1983 to 2012, annual COLAs were granted based on the availability to fund them through the special account.

423
00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:57.000
The COLA amount ranged from 1% to 5% based on the CPIU and funds available in each member's group account.

424
00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:15.000
In 2007, House Bill 653 changed the funding trigger as of June 30, 2007 for the special account and retained $204 million in the corpus of the fund that would have gone to the special account.

425
00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:24.000
In 2008, House Bill 1645 transferred $250 million from the special account to the corpus of the fund.

426
00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:32.500
2011, House Bill 2 transferred $167 million from the special account to the corpus of the fund.

427
00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:46.500
2012, House Bill 1483 eliminated the language for the special account and the remaining $16 million was transferred from the special account to the corpus of the fund.

428
00:44:46.500 --> 00:45:07.500
The elimination of the special account and the transfer of $637 million from the special account to the corpus of the fund have precluded any future COLAs from being granted to the New Hampshire Retirement System retirees unless enabling legislation is enacted.

429
00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:11.500
Retirees have received only one COLA since 2010.

430
00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:14.500
So we did have one COLA.

431
00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:19.000
Committeewoman Shewitt is the one that put that in.

432
00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:25.500
It was a 1.5% cost of living adjustment based on your first $50,000.

433
00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:41.500
Over the last decade, cost of living based on the CPIU has gone up by 29.33%, while COLA's granted to Group 2 Police and Fire over the same time period was 1.5%.

434
00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:57.500
Over the last 20 years, cost of living has gone up by 64.53%, while COLAs granted the Group 2 police and fire over the same time period were 12.25% and 15%, respectively.

435
00:45:57.500 --> 00:46:08.500
That is over 52% of a pensioner's buying power that has been eliminated due to inflation and the lack of adequate COLAs.

436
00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:13.000
Last year, $500 stipend went predominantly to Group 1.

437
00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:22.500
Out of the $11.6 million on the fiscal note, Group 1 received $10.75 million on that piece of legislation.

438
00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:27.500
Over 92% of the $11.6 million went to Group 1.

439
00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:35.000
Of the 23,267 eligible recipients, there were only 498 Group 2 fire receiving the stipend.

440
00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:40.500
Social Security has given its members a 8.7% increase this year.

441
00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:45.500
Unfortunately, Group 2 police and firefighters don't receive Social Security.

442
00:46:45.500 --> 00:47:04.500
Under the Windfall Act of 1984, if a Group 2 member were to be eligible for Social Security, their benefits would be reduced by 40 percent at minimum and as much as 90 percent depending on their pension.

443
00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:13.000
Predominantly, the New Hampshire retirement system is what Group 2 members rely on for their retirement income.

444
00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:30.000
Very simple math will show you that in a matter of time without COLA adjustments, pensioners will be forced on some kind of social services based on their pensions will be devoured by inflation.

445
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:37.000
The average pension for Group 2 policemen and firefighters is $38,192 and $42,948, respectively.

446
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:46.500
There's a report developed by NASRA on cost of living adjustments that show how inflation impacts the purchase power.

447
00:47:46.500 --> 00:48:00.000
A $25,000 pension falls to $16,690, 67% of its original value over a 20-year period with no cost of living adjustments based on a 2% inflation factor.

448
00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:05.500
The natural brief also shows that New Hampshire is an anomaly.

449
00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:11.000
Most states provide their retirees with a cost of living adjustment.

450
00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:24.500
The state of Maine, for example, who came to testify at the request of the decennial committee, stated that they offer a 2.5% COLA to their retirees.

451
00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:34.500
Massachusetts offers an ad hoc COLA typically based on the CPIU to 3%, applied to the first $13,000 of benefits.

452
00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:41.000
Vermont offers an automatic COLA based on the CPIU up to 5% compounded.

453
00:48:41.000 --> 00:49:14.000
Over the last several years, the legislature has arbitrarily taken funds away from retired workers that would have paid for COLAs and health care subsidies by changing dates and when excess earnings were reported and the elimination of the special account, some $637 million dedicated to retirees was diverted for no justifiable reason other than to lower the employer contributions on the backs of the retirees.

454
00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:25.500
Granting a reasonable COLA for Group 2, retirees will greatly reduce the impact inflation has incurred on them over the last two decades.

455
00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:38.000
I ask that you please support the retired public safety workers and vote in favor of House Bill 571 and those desperately needing COLA adjustments.

456
00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:42.000
Thank you and I will answer any questions.

457
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.000
Thank you.

458
00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.000
Are there any questions?

459
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.000
Thank you.

460
00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:51.000
Seeing none, thank you very much.

461
00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:57.000
Is there anyone else who wishes to testify on House Bill 571?

462
00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.000
Mr.

463
00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.000
Kavanaugh has an update.

464
00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.000
Thank you.

465
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:07.000
I want to clarify a mistake I made.

466
00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:11.500
There was a permanent cola in 2020 of 1.5%.

467
00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:16.500
I have here and I can provide this for you.

468
00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:25.500
This is a now you know publication that we put out on various topics available on our website.

469
00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:57.000
On the reverse, has the history of the colas and go through that very briefly from 2003 to 2006 it was 1% a true cola 2007 it was two and a quarter percent 2008 in 2010 it was 1.5 percent in 2011 and 12 there was a temporary allowance not a true cola of 500 or a thousand dollars depending on your benefit.

470
00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:03.000
From 2013 to 2017 there was no cola and no temporary allowance.

471
00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:06.000
18 there was a temporary allowance.

472
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.000
19 there was none.

473
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:11.000
2020 there was the 1.5 percent.

474
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:14.000
2021 there was a temporary allowance.

475
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.000
19, there was none.

476
00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.500
2020, there was the 1.5%.

477
00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:20.500
2021, there was none.

478
00:51:20.500 --> 00:51:27.000
And 2022 was a $500 temporary supplemental allowance, which is a one-time payment.

479
00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:30.500
So I apologize for speaking incorrectly before.

480
00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:32.500
Thank you.

481
00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:35.000
We'd appreciate having that information.

482
00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.000
Any other questions?

483
00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.000
All right.

484
00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.000
Oh, we'll get them.

485
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.000
Thank you.

486
00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.000
All right.

487
00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:50.000
Does anyone else wish to speak on House Bill 571?

488
00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:52.000
all right.

489
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:55.500
Seeing none, I will close the hearing.

490
00:51:55.500 --> 00:52:00.500
This bill is going to the Pension Subcommittee for analysis.

491
00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:04.000
And we will resume at 1 p.m.

492
00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.000

Good afternoon.

609
00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:00.000
Welcome back.

610
00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:06.500
I'm opening the hearing on House Bill 436, and I call Representative Pratt.

611
00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:11.000
He'll give us a pink card when he's done.

612
00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:13.000
Oh, he has one?

613
00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:16.000
I'll have somebody else up here.

614
00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:18.000
Thank you.

615
00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:20.500
I have a Thank you.

616
00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:22.500
Thank you.

617
00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:27.000
I have me speak today on House Bill 436.

618
00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:31.500
This is a bill relative to the retirement system.

619
00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:35.500
It's under the provisions of the retirement system.

620
00:56:35.500 --> 00:57:11.500
You probably have the bill in front of you and there's a financial study at the end of it so as we study the retirement system i see a lot of new faces here people have been around for a while they understand what's going on with the retirement system i'll be really brief but um quite a few years ago the system was underfunded it went undefended for about 20 years.

621
00:57:11.500 --> 00:57:17.000
And then about 10 years ago, the retirement system got revoked.

622
00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:25.000
And at that time, basically the state stopped funding the state of New Hampshire retirement system.

623
00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:32.500
It's being funded right now by the towns and by the individuals in Group 2.

624
00:57:32.500 --> 00:57:35.500
So their shares went way up.

625
00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:44.500
So I understand that the cost is an issue and that's why just a little history of that.

626
00:57:44.500 --> 00:58:02.500
So as we try to work on the retirement system, in order to get numbers to be able to work, the only way to get numbers from the retirement system actuaries is to file a bill.

627
00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:05.500
So we filed two bills here.

628
00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:21.500
There's like 14 14 all together i think but we filed two of them one of them is 436 the other one you'll hear later on about two o'clock is number 525.

629
00:58:21.500 --> 00:58:33.500
they're very close to the same kind of bill uh excuse me could you explain who we is we well it's Okay, fair enough.

630
00:58:33.500 --> 00:58:35.500
No problem.

631
00:58:35.500 --> 00:58:42.500
I just wasn't sure if you were the king or you had other people.

632
00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:54.500
I'm the only one on this bill here, but on the second bill we filed, Representative Trotter and Bordes were signed on that bill.

633
00:58:54.500 --> 00:59:01.500
They tried to get on this bill, but they didn't get on in time.

634
00:59:01.500 --> 00:59:07.000
But those are the three people that signed on that bill.

635
00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:28.000
There's a lot of people behind us that agree with the path were taken they may speak afterwards so bill 436 adjust the application of the minimum age minimum years of service annuity multiplications multipliers and and for group two service retirement.

636
00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:40.500
In 2011, let's see, January 1st of 2014, if you look down through the bill, you'll see where the date has changed on our bill.

637
00:59:40.500 --> 00:59:46.500
That's the first thing you notice when you look at the bill.

638
00:59:46.500 --> 00:59:56.500
So by doing that, it's going to take care of two years of people that are getting close to retirement.

639
00:59:56.500 --> 01:00:07.000
For the people that have been on this committee for a while, they understand that there's a problem in group two.

640
01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Guards at the jail, firemen and policemen aren't coming to the job like they used to.

641
01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:20.500
The retirement system is one of the big reasons for that.

642
01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:32.500
And then some people are leaving early, so the combination of nobody coming in and people leaving early is causing almost a crisis situation.

643
01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:40.000
You'll hear from the guards at the jail, and they're working a lot of overtime.

644
01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:51.500
And firemen are working a lot of overtime, policemen are working overtime to fill the gap of all these people that aren't here.

645
01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:59.500
So we understand that from last year and the year before, as we talked about this.

646
01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:11.000
So as we change the date to 2014 from 2012, that will take care of the next group of people that are retiring.

647
01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:15.000
This bill will go into effect not immediately.

648
01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:25.500
And by doing that, this bill and the next bill, we hope to encourage people to stay a few more years.

649
01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:35.500
That'll help a lot in the situation as opposed to having people come out, leave and retire the system early.

650
01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:39.500
So then you get down into the chart.

651
01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:44.000
The chart is where the real changes are made.

652
01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:49.000
On this bill, we changed the minimum years of service.

653
01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:59.000
It used to be 20 years, and now it was changed to 21, 22, and 23 minimum years of service.

654
01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:07.000
We're changing that by one year instead of going all the way back to 20 years.

655
01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:12.000
It's a step scale, and it's only one year change.

656
01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:18.000
And then the minimum age to retire at one point was 40.

657
01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:21.500
And now it's 48, 47, and 46.

658
01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:26.500
It's getting a little bit into the dangerous age here.

659
01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:38.000
If you're inside of a house and you need somebody to rescue you, you don't want somebody too old coming to get you.

660
01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.000
So 48 is right up there.

661
01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:47.500
So we brought it down from 49, 48 to 47, 47 to 46.

662
01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:50.000
That's just one year there.

663
01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:57.000
And then on the annuity multiplier, the annuity multiplier used to be at 2.5.

664
01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:05.500
So every year you worked, you got 2.5 in your retirement system out of your base pay.

665
01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:12.000
That 2.5 was changed down to 2.4, down to 2.3, 2.2, and 2.1.

666
01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.500
So we're coming up 0.1%.

667
01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:16.500
Just 1%.

668
01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:29.000
And that's quite a bit of money just to do that, but really badly needed in order to get this system back where it belongs.

669
01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:39.000
I understand that there is a study committee, and the study committee will be working on all these bills together.

670
01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.500
Does anybody have a question?

671
01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:43.500
I don't see any.

672
01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:45.500
That was easy.

673
01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:47.500
Okay.

674
01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:51.500
Yeah, it's a subcommittee, not a study committee.

675
01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:53.500
Okay.

676
01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:59.500
So I'll be back at 2 to speak about the other bill.

677
01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:01.500
Okay, thank you.

678
01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:03.500
Yeah.

679
01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:05.500
Yes.

680
01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:07.500
Mr.

681
01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:09.500
Kavanaugh.

682
01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:11.500
Thank you, Madam Chair.

683
01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:20.500
Again, for the record, I'm Mark Kavanaugh, Associate Counsel and Compliance Officer for the New Hampshire Retirement System.

684
01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:32.500
I just wanted to start with a brief overview because this afternoon we are looking at four bills that all address the same issue.

685
01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:42.000
You may have in front of you this chart that shows how benefits are currently provided for Group 2s.

686
01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:48.000
As the prior speaker mentioned, in 2011, the benefit structure was changed.

687
01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Persons who were vested had 10 years of service as of January 1st, 2012, kept the old benefit.

688
01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:03.500
Retire at age 45, 20 years of service, get 2.5% for each year.

689
01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:07.000
Persons hired after 1-1-12, whole new setup.

690
01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.500
You've got to be older.

691
01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:13.500
You've got to be 52 and a half.

692
01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:17.500
You've got to have 25 years of service.

693
01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:25.500
In between, you have those who were already working but were not vested on January 1st.

694
01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:28.500
That's who we're talking about here.

695
01:05:28.500 --> 01:05:56.000
It's a cohort of about 1, about 1700 people um these are their rules were changed so that depending on how much service you had between zero and 9.9 years you would be on this tiered chart that specified uh the age starting at 46 up to, the years of service 21 up to 26.

696
01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:29.000
What this particular bill does is take those who were between eight and nine years as of 1112, close to vestigium but not quite, who currently are required to have 21 years of service at age 46, is going to put that group, just that group, those who had 89 years of service, back into the old rules, age 45, 20 years, in a 2.5% multiplier.

697
01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:38.500
The other effect it has is it also then makes the old definition of earnable compensation applicable to them.

698
01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:51.000
And that means in particular, certain types of what we call compensation over base that are not counted when calculating your retirement are back in.

699
01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:55.500
Those being primarily payouts of sick and vacation accruals.

700
01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:58.500
That's the biggest element of those.

701
01:06:58.500 --> 01:07:05.500
For these people currently, because they were not vested, those wouldn't account when calculating.

702
01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:09.000
Now they're back in for those folks.

703
01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:34.000
So by allowing these people to retire earlier, giving them an increased multiplier, as well as the old expanded definition, that's where we come up with the cost estimate for this bill, which is in fiscal year 2026 would be $2,820,000 for the state, $12,520,000 for the local political subdivisions.

704
01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
That's an annual cost.

705
01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:43.000
It is also estimated that this would add $133.6 million to the unfunded liability.

706
01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:52.500
I finally would just like to speak to the comment that this would perhaps assist in recruiting and retention.

707
01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:59.000
It's not going to assist in recruiting because it doesn't affect new hires.

708
01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:12.000
And I'm not sure if it will help with retention because by its nature, the bill is designed to allow people to retire earlier, not later.

709
01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:41.000
And so i'd open it up for questions thank you i take it that the hundred hundred thirty three point six million would be the cost to terminally fund it correct thank you are there questions represent o'brien thank you i am not sponsoring this one so thank you madam chair i checked for double checking Thank you.

710
01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:46.500
I am not sponsoring this one, so thank you, Madam Chair.

711
01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:48.500
I checked.

712
01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:50.500
For double-checking.

713
01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:52.500
Thank you.

714
01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:54.500
Mr.

715
01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:58.000
Kavanaugh, thank you for taking my question.

716
01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:11.500
It may not be under your jurisdiction to worry about items such as spirit decor that exists within the departments, whether you're a policeman, fireman, or whatever.

717
01:09:11.500 --> 01:09:18.500
But when you have multiple tiers like this, it could have an adverse effect.

718
01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:47.000
Like you say, it may not affect the hiring and everything, but people who are currently under that employment can affect it the way that they feel, particularly when one person is getting a better benefit as compared to another one that's on the same shift, eating the same meal and fighting the same fire, per se.

719
01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:50.000
I'll take your word for it.

720
01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Yeah, okay.

721
01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Well, follow up if I may.

722
01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Your question, Representative O'Brien.

723
01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Well, the thing is that have you heard from any of the chiefs or anything else like that that would support this because of the spare decor issues?

724
01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:20.500
Representative O'Brien, we have a number of people who are testifying who will be more inclined to do this.

725
01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:22.500
Thank you, Madam Chair.

726
01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:25.000
And the answer is no.

727
01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:29.500
People don't call me about that kind of thing.

728
01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:31.500
Okay.

729
01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:33.500
Thank you.

730
01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:35.500
Yeah, really.

731
01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:44.000
But I just would say also that we don't take a position on any of these bills.

732
01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:47.500
I just want to make that clear.

733
01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:50.000
These are policy decisions, 100%.

734
01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:56.000
And secondly, 60% of our Group 2 members were hired after 1-1-12.

735
01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.500
So that's a large percentage.

736
01:10:58.500 --> 01:11:02.500
Really, that's more than I would have thought.

737
01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:04.500
Thank you.

738
01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:09.000
It surprised me when I saw the number two.

739
01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Okay.

740
01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
Any other questions?

741
01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Representative Fitzpatrick.

742
01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
Thank you, Madam Chair.

743
01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:29.500
Just for clarification, what this would do was bring a person's benefits back to what they were told the benefits were when they were hired.

744
01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:31.500
Is that correct?

745
01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:36.500
In other words, they were hired when they were told.

746
01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:45.500
But it would put them back to where the benefits were before the law changed at the time.

747
01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:49.000
Right, but the way that it's written.

748
01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
Yes.

749
01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Okay, thank you.

750
01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
Other questions?

751
01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Representative True.

752
01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:02.500
Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you for taking my question.

753
01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:04.500
You're welcome.

754
01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:11.000
You had covered this, but you went by it so quickly I forgot.

755
01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.000
I should have written it down.

756
01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Who does this apply to again and why?

757
01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:36.500
This applies to Group 2 police and firefighters and corrections officers who were hired prior to January 1st of 2012, but were not, I'm sorry, July 1st of 2011, but were not vested by January 1st, 2012.

758
01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:50.500
So people who were working when the law changed and had somewhere between 0.1 and 9.9 years of service, but they hadn't quite, some of them reached vesting.

759
01:12:50.500 --> 01:13:04.500
And their benefits were changed such that they had to work longer, they had a lower multiplier, and they had to be a little bit older to retire.

760
01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:16.000
This bill is intended to restore one portion of those people back to what the benefits were prior to the change in law.

761
01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
Yes, Representative Troup.

762
01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
Thank you, Madam Chair.

763
01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
How many?

764
01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.500
That was 1,700 people, maybe?

765
01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:29.000
In the whole group of what we call non-vesteds.

766
01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:45.500
I don't know the number of people who would be impacted specifically by this statute because it only applies to those who had between eight and 10 years of service as of 1-1-12.

767
01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:51.000
It also affects people with less service, but not as dramatically.

768
01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Correct.

769
01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
Thank you.

770
01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Okay.

771
01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Any other questions?

772
01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
All right.

773
01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:37.500
Thank you very much mr cavanaugh catherine heke or heck good afternoon chairman mcguire members of the committee for the record my name is Katherine heck I represent the New Hampshire Municipal Association and we are here today to oppose this bill I had sent in written testimony and it's not on the policy proposal or what it's looking to change it's solely on the cost that would be borne by the municipalities.

774
01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:53.500
So our only comment is that our members take a position that they have adopted, that any changes to benefits resulting in increased costs, we are asked to oppose on their behalf.

775
01:14:53.500 --> 01:16:02.000
And if the state chooses to terminally fund this program and having no impact on municipalities, we would have no position on the bill or any other bill with a cost associated with it so there's no policy opposition solely cost all right thank you for that are there any questions seeing none thank you for your testimony brian rill good afternoon madam chair members of the committee once again my name is brian rill i'm the president of professional firefighters in new hampshire um in the interest of of time and respecting committee's time, I'm going to provide my testimony, and I'd ask that you please apply equally to House Bill 436, House Bill 525, and House Bill 579, respectively, as I believe the intent of each of these bills is to accomplish a similar goal.

776
01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:07.000
So I will not be testifying on the other two.

777
01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:15.000
Madam Chair, I'm just going to speak broadly about the retirement system and where we're at.

778
01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:21.000
The state of our fire service is deeply troubling at the moment.

779
01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:30.500
Throughout the state, we're witnessing the lowest recruitment and retention numbers that we've seen in the last 10 years.

780
01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:44.500
In the mid to late 2000s, the New Hampshire CPAT exam, the candidate physical agility test, saw well over 500 candidates annually, and today we barely see 200.

781
01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:53.000
The recruitment and retention crisis is linked to the sweeping retirement changes that were made in 2011.

782
01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:59.000
The trends show a consistent decline in applicants since January of 2012.

783
01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:14.500
Simply put, firefighters, police officers, and correctional officers are wondering if the prolonged physical and emotional stress of a dedicated career in public service is truly worth the deteriorating retirement benefit.

784
01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:16.500
it.

785
01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:31.500
Now members who are becoming retirement eligible are realizing that they can't afford to retire at all and those that bear witness to their struggles are choosing to leave prematurely.

786
01:17:31.500 --> 01:18:14.000
We heard a statistic that 60% if I heard correctly of our members in the group 2 system were hired after the changes were made and that may be so but I will tell you that we are just now seeing those that were impacted by those changes technically becoming eligible to retire they're realizing what their benefits actually going to be and those that have come after them are seeing that as well and they're not sticking around to wait and become retirement eligible.

787
01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
They're leaving prematurely.

788
01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:32.500
Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and all chambers of the Statehouse have acknowledged that New Hampshire is suffering from this recruitment and retention epidemic, and it's like none we've ever seen.

789
01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:41.500
A staggering amount of these lawmakers have agreed that passing positive, substantial retirement legislation is the long-term solution.

790
01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:48.000
Madam Chair, that very opportunity is now before the members of this committee.

791
01:18:48.000 --> 01:19:02.000
You all have the ability to begin to change the narrative of public safety in New Hampshire once and for all, and I implore you to take action.

792
01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:14.000
There are a number of retirement bills before you, and I suspect a lot of collaboration to be done to find the right solution.

793
01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:29.000
It's likely that some or all of the retirement bills heard today will be referred to the pension subcommittee, and I would like to express our support for that process.

794
01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:42.000
However, when working through this process, I would kindly ask the committee to take an approach aimed to do the most good for the most people.

795
01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:50.500
I heard that from the retirement system, there were approximately 1,700 firefighters, police officers, and correctional officers.

796
01:19:50.500 --> 01:19:59.000
My numbers are slightly off, so your written testimony that you may have from me cites 1824.

797
01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:08.000
That number did come from the retirement system, but it may not be the most up to date.

798
01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:16.000
I would certainly take the gentleman's word from the system on the accuracy of the numbers.

799
01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:39.000
But I will say even with that, that number in the sliding scale and a total of somewhere around 4,500 still in the system altogether in group two, the concept of providing a substantive change for a small subset of individuals is concerning to the firefighters.

800
01:20:39.000 --> 01:21:01.500
For example, passing legislation that would only impact that group of members with eight to 10 years in the system at the time of the 2011 changes will leave approximately 80% of that sliding scale feeling as though they are once again being left behind.

801
01:21:01.500 --> 01:21:05.500
And I believe this would perpetuate the problem.

802
01:21:05.500 --> 01:21:21.000
I would ask that if referred to committee, along with the other retirement bills, we look to see how we can make positive, impactful changes to the most number of people.

803
01:21:21.000 --> 01:22:10.500
It is no longer conjecture to say that we're hemorrhaging firefighters, police officers, and correctional officers in our great state, and we have reached the point public safety in new hampshire is a liability the time for action is now madam chair on behalf of the professional firefighters of new hampshire i would ask for this committee's unanimous support to move towards progressive and substantial improvements to group 2 retirement and i would like to offer my support or information that may be relevant to this committee or that of the subcommittee as we move forward to find solutions.

804
01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:22.500
Thank you all for handling what is likely the most difficult task this session, and I appreciate all of your support for your firefighters.

805
01:22:22.500 --> 01:22:26.000
I'd be happy to answer any questions.

806
01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.500
Thank you for your testimony.

807
01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:30.500
Questions?

808
01:22:30.500 --> 01:22:32.500
Representative O'Brien.

809
01:22:32.500 --> 01:22:39.000
Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you, Brother Rill, for taking my question.

810
01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:54.000
Prior to 2011, am I correct in understanding that the employee paid nine and three-quarter% towards the retirement, and then when they changed the law, it jumped up to 12.8%.

811
01:22:54.000 --> 01:23:01.500
So the employees are paying for some of the changes that were affected by this.

812
01:23:01.500 --> 01:23:13.500
So even though there was a cut to their benefits, they are paying more in their weekly contributions into the New Hampshire retirement system.

813
01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:16.500
Am I correct in assuming that?

814
01:23:16.500 --> 01:23:18.500
Yes, you're correct.

815
01:23:18.500 --> 01:23:29.500
The employee contribution is 11.8%, but yes, we are paying more towards our own benefit, the benefit that was taken in 2011.

816
01:23:29.500 --> 01:23:31.500
That's correct.

817
01:23:31.500 --> 01:23:41.500
I'd like to say that that amount is paid by all firefighters, no matter what their pension calculation would be.

818
01:23:41.500 --> 01:23:43.500
Isn't that true?

819
01:23:43.500 --> 01:23:45.500
That's correct.

820
01:23:45.500 --> 01:23:47.500
I'll stipulate.

821
01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:49.500
Very good.

822
01:23:49.500 --> 01:23:51.500
Other questions?

823
01:23:51.500 --> 01:23:53.500
Representative Broda.

824
01:23:53.500 --> 01:23:55.500
Thank you.

825
01:23:55.500 --> 01:23:57.500
Mr.

826
01:23:57.500 --> 01:24:07.000
Will, you mentioned that there was a decrease in the number of people who are applying for firefighter positions.

827
01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:18.000
And do you have some numbers behind, I mean, is there information that you can give to us that would help us?

828
01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:22.000
You don't have to do it right now.

829
01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:26.000
You can send it to us by email.

830
01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:35.500
The number of applicants that you've received that have applied to this position from 2012, the last 10 years.

831
01:24:35.500 --> 01:24:37.500
Sure.

832
01:24:37.500 --> 01:24:41.500
Yeah, we can get that information for you.

833
01:24:41.500 --> 01:24:47.000
The New Hampshire Fire Standards and Training keeps track of that.

834
01:24:47.000 --> 01:25:11.000
and it has been published actually in the recent recruitment and retention report the state had put together a recruitment and retention committee that looked at some of these numbers and they identified a steady decline since 2011 which we can show you the numbers for but they.

835
01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:26.000
And in addition to that, one of the changes that they cited in that report was restoring benefits back to pre-2011 changes was in order to help recruitment and retention.

836
01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
Thank you, Madam Chair.

837
01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:39.000
And have the tests, especially like the physical tests, have they remained the same so that it's not more challenging to be?

838
01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
I'm just checking.

839
01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:49.000
To my knowledge, the physical agility test has not changed in a significant number of years.

840
01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.500
Okay, thank you so much.

841
01:25:51.500 --> 01:25:53.500
Representative Gerhardt.

842
01:25:53.500 --> 01:25:55.500
Thank you, Madam Chair.

843
01:25:55.500 --> 01:26:31.500
Forgive me if I i missed it are you a firefighter yourself yes sir i'm a captain in portsmouth the boards with fire department okay thank you other uh questions all right seeing none thank you for your testimony and we will expect your participation in the subcommittee claudia prescott hello madam chair thank you looks like our ranks are increasing i just wanted to speak because he had some good questions.

844
01:26:31.500 --> 01:26:35.000
So my name is Officer Claudia Prescott.

845
01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:44.000
I've been employed for 17 years at the New Hampshire Department of Corrections are almost 17 years now.

846
01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:52.500
So yeah, I just want to address some of the issues that have come up thus far.

847
01:26:52.500 --> 01:27:35.500
Yes, this bill only this particular bill only speaks to a couple of years it does address some of us that are further down so it would help someone like myself who had less than six years so it would it would address me a little bit but I'm not in that group that would get everything back that I was promised when I was hired or that if you go to website, it still says to this day that you get your best five years.

848
01:27:35.500 --> 01:27:37.500
That's never been accurate.

849
01:27:37.500 --> 01:27:41.500
I don't know why it's still on there.

850
01:27:41.500 --> 01:27:44.000
So it's been very misleading.

851
01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:57.000
So when I was hired, I was told I would get my best three years and a number of other benefits that were changed in 2011.

852
01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:14.500
But it was never changed to our best five years, despite what their PowerPoints, their YouTube channel, and everything all over their website led us to believe for the next over decade into this day.

853
01:28:14.500 --> 01:28:16.500
It still says that.

854
01:28:16.500 --> 01:28:18.500
So that sucks.

855
01:28:18.500 --> 01:28:22.000
But anyway, that's not going to happen.

856
01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:40.500
What this would do, it would restore some of the parity anyway for people that were hired, that did go through the academy and have served for all these years right alongside other officers, firefighters, and policemen.

857
01:28:40.500 --> 01:28:43.000
Literally, they were hired together.

858
01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:49.000
They went through the academy together, and they've served their entire careers.

859
01:28:49.000 --> 01:29:38.000
Only the people that they went through the academy with are under the old deal and they actually get their best three and they get everything that both officers were promised and these other people because they were hired maybe a couple of days or a month or so later get the entire new deal so um yeah that's a huge morale issue and so it does really help those officers it me a little bit, but I think it's a really huge deal for those people that literally missed it by, you know, a tiny little bit.

860
01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:42.000
So it is a huge deal for them.

861
01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:45.500
And it is a huge morale issue.

862
01:29:45.500 --> 01:29:56.500
because yeah, I've served alongside those people that paid less into it because the contribution rates have changed significantly over the years.

863
01:29:56.500 --> 01:30:02.500
I think you all know that certainly the cost is a factor.

864
01:30:02.500 --> 01:30:23.000
The people that got the old deal, they got their best three, their bank out, and all the things that I was promised when I was hired and for the first nearly six years of my career, they paid in less.

865
01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
They got everything.

866
01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
I pay in more.

867
01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:35.000
I've paid in more my entire career, and I got less, and my taxes were raised.

868
01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:42.500
The state now contributes less, so when our contribution went up, the state contributed less.

869
01:30:42.500 --> 01:30:50.000
So the municipalities, well, they got a tax holiday because the market was doing fantastic.

870
01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:57.500
Now they have to contribute a little, and they did that by raising our taxes.

871
01:30:57.500 --> 01:31:07.500
And I, like most people, I'm a taxpayer in the state of New Hampshire, as of our both my children.

872
01:31:07.500 --> 01:31:10.000
The market was doing fantastic.

873
01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:13.500
Now they have to contribute a little.

874
01:31:13.500 --> 01:31:17.500
And they did that by raising our taxes.

875
01:31:17.500 --> 01:31:27.500
And I, like most people, I'm a taxpayer in the state of New Hampshire, as of our both my children.

876
01:31:27.500 --> 01:31:32.000
So, you know, we got it on all ends.

877
01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:35.500
So we contribute more, we get less.

878
01:31:35.500 --> 01:31:40.500
And then we got nailed with our taxes as well.

879
01:31:40.500 --> 01:31:48.000
So we pay a lot more and we got a lot less out of it.

880
01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:51.000
So, yeah, it's a morale issue.

881
01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.500
It's definitely a money issue.

882
01:31:53.500 --> 01:31:55.500
I totally understand that.

883
01:31:55.500 --> 01:31:59.000
I don't know what else came up.

884
01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:05.000
The standards have been lowered for us at the Department of Corrections.

885
01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:12.000
In 2010, the legislature, we have a budget office, did a legislative budget audit.

886
01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
It's really interesting.

887
01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
Great read.

888
01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:19.500
I encourage you guys to read it.

889
01:32:19.500 --> 01:32:50.500
they did an audit and they said at the men's prison at the time we had 241 officers and they were concerned about our staffing ratios at the time we now have around 130 left so our recruitment and retention to say has been lagging that doesn't even begin to encompass it we areERS, COTs, BALLERINAS, ANYTHING TRYING TO COVER THOSE SHIFTS.

890
01:32:50.500 --> 01:32:52.500
WE CAN'T DO IT.

891
01:32:52.500 --> 01:32:56.000
WE'RE RUNNING BELOW MINIMUM ALL THE TIME.

892
01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
IT'S INCREDIBLY UNSAFE.

893
01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:01.000
SO YEAH, WE'RE WORKING INCREDIBLE HOURS.

894
01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
THAT'S UNSAFE.

895
01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
WE'RE RUNNING BELOW MINIMUM.

896
01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
THAT'S UNSAFE.

897
01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:19.000
I MEAN, I THINK PART OF IT, A HUGE PART OF IT, ISN'T JUST it, isn't just the fact that the changes were made.

898
01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:23.000
It's the fact that the state lost credibility.

899
01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:29.000
How can you enter into a contract and renege on a contract?

900
01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:41.500
I mean, I told my daughters who are both nurses, don't go work for the state because you can't believe what you have in writing.

901
01:33:41.500 --> 01:33:45.000
I mean, that's what happened to me.

902
01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:48.000
I had almost six years in.

903
01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:53.000
I believed what I was told when I was hired.

904
01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:56.500
I believed, that's what happened to me.

905
01:33:56.500 --> 01:33:59.500
I had almost six years in.

906
01:33:59.500 --> 01:34:04.500
I believed what I was told when I was hired.

907
01:34:04.500 --> 01:34:07.500
I believe that was a contract.

908
01:34:07.500 --> 01:34:09.500
Wouldn't you?

909
01:34:09.500 --> 01:34:11.500
Wouldn't anybody?

910
01:34:11.500 --> 01:34:21.500
I mean, if you have a deal with a roofer, would they put half your roof on and then change?

911
01:34:21.500 --> 01:34:31.500
So yeah, I told both my nurses, don't go work for the state because you can't believe anything they say.

912
01:34:31.500 --> 01:35:11.500
And I think is a problem I think that's a problem we have is that you can't trust the state and I think that the best way to rectify that in my opinion and that's my opinion we all have those is to honor the commitment that the state made to us when they hired us is to do the honorable thing we We were told one thing when we were hired and it was retroactively changed for 10 years.

913
01:35:11.500 --> 01:35:20.000
And then for the next 11 years, we were told something else and that was also changed.

914
01:35:20.000 --> 01:36:07.000
We literally hire people to this day telling them it's gonna be their best five years and that's just not true and if you can't go to the new hampshire retirement web website to get good information where can you go any questions okay thank you very much for your testimony are there any questions thank you very much jennifer fleming uh michael giha thank you madam chair my name is michael giha i'm a detective with the salem Police Department and I'm currently serving as the president of the New Hampshire Police Association.

915
01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:13.000
Today this committee is hearing several bills relating to Group 2 retirement.

916
01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:20.500
The brief comments I want to share with you all are somewhat general in nature.

917
01:36:20.500 --> 01:36:26.500
So I will say them now instead of testifying on every bill.

918
01:36:26.500 --> 01:36:35.500
There are some bills we believe make sense, but some were published without the fiscal notes being available.

919
01:36:35.500 --> 01:36:41.500
So it is difficult to determine which ones we support more strongly.

920
01:36:41.500 --> 01:36:46.000
That will become clearer as you get this information.

921
01:36:46.000 --> 01:37:00.000
Having said that, I want to convey the importance of making some changes to the Group 2 system to help states, cities, towns recruit and retain police officers.

922
01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:06.500
I'm sure you all have heard the challenges law enforcement is facing today.

923
01:37:06.500 --> 01:37:16.000
The availability of new hire police officers is at a record low, making for an extremely challenging employment pipeline.

924
01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:26.000
Existing police officers are departing earlier than we ever seen before, putting extreme pressure on police departments across the state.

925
01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:37.000
The one area that we believe can have a positive impact on recruitment, and especially retention, is changes within our retirement system.

926
01:37:37.000 --> 01:38:30.500
Nearly 12 years ago, the state took steps to deal with retirement funding issues at that time no one could have contemplated the workforce situation we face today but some of those changes are exact exasperating today's problem the most specific issue is the creation of the middle tier that you have previously heard about I know that group two stakeholder groups which include the New Hampshire Police Association, the New Hampshire Troopers Association, and the Professional Firefighters of New Hampshire among others are committed to working with you in a unified approach to see if something can be done that will help with the serious problem.

927
01:38:30.500 --> 01:38:46.000
So today we ask that you assess these bills from the perspective of which ones might help with the recruitment and retention challenges that the state and local governments are facing.

928
01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:56.500
As these bills go to the subcommittee for further review, we will be there to assist in any way we can.

929
01:38:56.500 --> 01:38:58.500
Thank you.

930
01:38:58.500 --> 01:39:00.500
Thank you.

931
01:39:00.500 --> 01:39:02.500
Are there any questions?

932
01:39:02.500 --> 01:39:04.500
Thank you.

933
01:39:04.500 --> 01:39:06.500
Very good.

934
01:39:06.500 --> 01:39:11.000
That's the last part I have for this bill.

935
01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
Ms.

936
01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:16.000
Fleming was for a different bill.

937
01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:20.000
Is there anyone else who wishes to testify?

938
01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:27.000
We've got time on this one, so you might as well do this one.

939
01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
Representative Pearson.

940
01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.500
I was expecting longer testimony.

941
01:39:31.500 --> 01:39:35.000
I was expecting a little longer testimony.

942
01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:38.500
Thank you, Madam Chair, for the record.

943
01:39:38.500 --> 01:39:42.500
Representative Steve Pearson, Rockingham District 13 now, Derry.

944
01:39:42.500 --> 01:39:45.500
I've served two terms on eDNA.

945
01:39:45.500 --> 01:39:49.500
I'm in my third term in the House.

946
01:39:49.500 --> 01:39:53.000
And I thank you all for listening.

947
01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:56.500
One of the, excuse me one second.

948
01:39:56.500 --> 01:40:17.000
One of the, one of the things I want to touch on here, and I have to, I have to read it is there's a, there's a piece in the New Hampshire state constitution that I think is very valuable here.

949
01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
And that's Article 23.

950
01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:26.500
Article 23 of the New Hampshire State Constitution basically says you can't make retroactive law.

951
01:40:26.500 --> 01:40:29.500
And there's a reason for that.

952
01:40:29.500 --> 01:40:37.500
Retroactive law, and I'll read directly from it, retrospective laws are highly injurious, oppressive, and unjust.

953
01:40:37.500 --> 01:40:41.000
No such laws, therefore, should be made.

954
01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.500
That was done in 1784.

955
01:40:43.500 --> 01:40:52.500
So please understand that the circumstances that we're in right now here involve something that was done retrospectively.

956
01:40:52.500 --> 01:41:04.000
And the founders of the state of New Hampshire in this great document recognized back then that doing things retrospectively would cause problems.

957
01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:07.000
And that's why we're here today.

958
01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:18.500
Listening to the great testimony that I heard from various folks, I want to bring up a couple of other quick points here.

959
01:41:18.500 --> 01:41:33.000
When the employee rates were changed in 2011 as part of this restructuring, the rates that Group 2 employees in New Hampshire pay is the highest in New England.

960
01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:36.500
And in one particular case, it's double.

961
01:41:36.500 --> 01:41:42.500
Now we talk about the bleed that's going on here with folks.

962
01:41:42.500 --> 01:41:51.500
The city of Manchester, as an example,'s police department has lost 47 officers in the last 18 months.

963
01:41:51.500 --> 01:41:57.000
That's 25% of their police department has gone in 18 months.

964
01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.500
That is beyond crisis level.

965
01:41:59.500 --> 01:42:08.500
As a matter of fact, the union leader did a good article on it a little while ago.

966
01:42:08.500 --> 01:42:21.000
The state prison system has hundreds of vacancies, and they have come up with creative and frankly dangerous ways to try to deal with that.

967
01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:34.000
And the other circumstance that we're now seeing that we never really saw before is that we have communities that are stealing employees from each other.

968
01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:40.000
Now, generally speaking, the larger communities will benefit from that, including mine.

969
01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:48.000
Derry has a little bit bigger of a budget to absorb having to train new people.

970
01:42:48.000 --> 01:43:19.500
But if you're from a small town and you've got five police officers, you can't afford to have one leave every year because frankly, you don't have the budget to train someone to small town and you've got five police officers, you can't afford to have one leave every year because frankly, you don't have the budget to train someone to replace them.

971
01:43:19.500 --> 01:43:24.000
So a serious deep dive needs to occur here.

972
01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:36.500
This is a problem that was forecasted 10 years ago and the warning signs, what those warning signs were done with is up for debate.

973
01:43:36.500 --> 01:43:39.500
Most of them were frankly ignored.

974
01:43:39.500 --> 01:43:48.000
But the actual crisis that's before us now is far worse than was even predicted in 2011.

975
01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:55.500
So I just ask that this subcommittee especially really take a deep look at this.

976
01:43:55.500 --> 01:44:02.000
Look at what the other states have done and what they haven't done.

977
01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:09.500
None of them, by the way, not a single other New England state went retroactive.

978
01:44:09.500 --> 01:44:16.000
Other New England states made changes, but they were all for new hires.

979
01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.500
Only New Hampshire went backwards.

980
01:44:18.500 --> 01:44:25.500
And I think that should tell you quite a bit right then and there.

981
01:44:25.500 --> 01:44:28.500
So I appreciate this committee's time.

982
01:44:28.500 --> 01:44:51.000
I know it's complicated when you have several bills that seem to be going in the same direction, but please understand the concept is generally the same here as to what the problem is, because the problem is the same regardless of the bill number.

983
01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:55.500
So I would certainly entertain any questions you have.

984
01:44:55.500 --> 01:44:57.500
Thank you, Representative Pearson.

985
01:44:57.500 --> 01:44:59.500
Are there any questions?

986
01:44:59.500 --> 01:45:01.500
Representative Shewitt.

987
01:45:01.500 --> 01:45:03.500
Thank you, Madam Chair.

988
01:45:03.500 --> 01:45:05.500
Thank you, Representative Pearson.

989
01:45:05.500 --> 01:45:40.500
thank you representative pearson are there any questions representative shuett thank you madam chair thank you representative pearson um the constitution section that you cited uh was that law that was passed in 2011 challenged in court on that basis not on that basis the law the challenge that was done in court in 2011 was based on a contract clause, which the courts determined that there is no contract.

990
01:45:40.500 --> 01:45:51.000
The word contract actually doesn't exist in the language of group two that I can find, or the pension system period.

991
01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:55.500
But it was not challenged under Article Article 23.

992
01:45:55.500 --> 01:45:59.000
It should have been, but was not.

993
01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
Other questions?

994
01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
All right.

995
01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:06.500
Seeing none, thank you for your time.

996
01:46:06.500 --> 01:46:08.500
Thank you, Madam Chair.

997
01:46:08.500 --> 01:46:16.500
And I'm not sure when the subcommittee will meet, but I'm sure you will get involved.

998
01:46:16.500 --> 01:46:58.000
Is there anyone else who wishes to testify on house bill 436 mr rill you have thank you madam chair i just wanted to let the committee know uh we just emailed a copy of that recruitment and retention report so you should thank you very much that will be helpful anyone else okay then i'll close the hearing on house bill 436 and it will be going to the pension subcommittee we have a few minutes before the next hearing Thank you.

999

Thank you.

1000
01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
Thank you.

1001
01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
Thank you.

1002
01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
Thank you.

1003

Thank you.

1004

Thank you.

1005
01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
Thank you.

1006
01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
Thank you.

1007
01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
Thank you.

1008
01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
Thank you.

1009
01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
Thank you.

1010
01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
Thank you.

1011
01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
Thank you.

1012
01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
Thank you.

1013
01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
Thank you.

1014
01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
Okay.

1015
01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:37.000
I'd like to mention that we do have fiscal notes for all these bills.

1016
01:47:37.000 --> 01:48:01.500
There's copies over on that table and we we have received the recruitment and retention report and also a comment from the retirement system explaining their uh average their final average final calculation data so and yes i'm opening the ON HOUSE BILL 449 AND I CALL REPRESENTATIVE GOLEY.

1017
01:48:01.500 --> 01:48:06.000
THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE.

1018
01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:15.000
FOR THE RECORD, REPRESENTATIVE JEFF GOLEY REPRESENTAT Representative Jeff Goley representing Hillsborough 21, which is Manchester Ward 1.

1019
01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:18.500
Here today to introduce House Bill 449.

1020
01:48:18.500 --> 01:48:39.500
and like the previous bill this is another attempt to rework the tiers that we have currently in group two and bringing more members who had their multipliers reduced and their ages increased more towards the system that they were hired under.

1021
01:48:39.500 --> 01:48:45.000
And I will go directly to page one of the bill.

1022
01:48:45.000 --> 01:49:32.500
And if you go down to line 12 where those changes start and actually to line 20 and what it does is it puts the for those will be commence service on or after July 1st 2011 it puts the two and a half multiplier back in for the first 20 years and then it puts them back to the 2% multiplier for anything after that subsequent years and it goes if you follow down through it's less than four years it does the two and a half multiplier for anything after that subsequent years.

1023
01:49:32.500 --> 01:49:39.000
And it goes, if you follow down through, it's less than four years.

1024
01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:51.500
It does the two and a half multiplier for the first 20 years, and then 2.1% for subsequent years and further on down that chart.

1025
01:49:51.500 --> 01:50:15.000
So it's another attempt, like the previous bill and the other bills coming forward, to put those folks who were promised a benefit and what they were hired under, getting them closer to what they had been hired under and thought they had prior to being vested.

1026
01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:27.500
I think the important thing with this bill is it doesn't just address a couple of years of folks, that it addresses a bigger group.

1027
01:50:27.500 --> 01:50:42.500
And I think policy-wise, if we're going to address the issue, that they all ought to be included in a solution that we aim to or strive to put forward.

1028
01:50:42.500 --> 01:50:46.000
So that's why this bill was filed.

1029
01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:51.000
There are other folks behind me that can answer questions.

1030
01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:59.500
But I think in the previous bill, you understand where we're going with these number of bills.

1031
01:50:59.500 --> 01:51:06.500
And there's just different ways and different solutions to trying to solve a problem.

1032
01:51:06.500 --> 01:51:08.500
Thank you, Representative Goley.

1033
01:51:08.500 --> 01:51:15.000
Does this bill address everyone in the transition group one way or another?

1034
01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
Yes, it will.

1035
01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
Thank you.

1036
01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:22.000
That's what I wanted to know.

1037
01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:28.000
Any other questions that you think Representative Goley might want to answer?

1038
01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
Representative Broda.

1039
01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
Thank you.

1040
01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:43.500
So Representative Goley, this essentially will eliminate that tier system that was created, or will it leave, or it will reduce that tier?

1041
01:51:43.500 --> 01:51:45.500
Correct.

1042
01:51:45.500 --> 01:51:47.500
Okay.

1043
01:51:47.500 --> 01:51:49.500
Thank you.

1044
01:51:49.500 --> 01:51:51.500
Okay.

1045
01:51:51.500 --> 01:51:56.000
All right, thank you very much for your testimony.

1046
01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
Thank you.

1047
01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
Mr.

1048
01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
Kavanaugh.

1049
01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:11.500
Thank you again for the record, Mark Kavanaugh, Associate Counsel and Compliance Officer for the New Hampshire Retirement System.

1050
01:52:11.500 --> 01:52:33.500
This bill takes a different approach by restoring the 2.5 multiplier for the first 20 years of service, and then depending on where the transitional folks were on the old tier, they'll have variable multipliers from 2.1 to 2.4 for any years over 20.

1051
01:52:33.500 --> 01:52:42.000
This also applies not just to the transition this would apply to anyone hired after one one.

1052
01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:49.000
I mean 7 1 2011 who currently have a 2.0 multiplier for all years.

1053
01:52:49.000 --> 01:53:19.500
So there's a substantial amount of the cost that for 60% of our group twos were hired after that date who will have an increase in the multiplier as well and that's why we come up with the costs of in the fiscal notes but 3.5 million for the state in 13.3 million for the political subdivisions in 2026 for contributions.

1054
01:53:19.500 --> 01:53:24.000
And a $82.2 million increase in the accrued liability.

1055
01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:37.000
Once this has been amortized out, there will be a permanent effect on the rates of $1.9 for police and AND 1.99 FOR FIRE IN PERPETUITY.

1056
01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:43.000
THAT'S 1.99 PERCENT PERCENTAGE POINTS MORE THAN WHAT THE CURRENT RATES ARE.

1057
01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:47.000
SO I WOULD OPEN TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS.

1058
01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
OKAY.

1059
01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
THANK YOU.

1060
01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
questions?

1061
01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
Representative Dolan.

1062
01:53:55.000 --> 01:54:05.500
I would note also that there are some states who have similar arrangements, but they do it the other way around.

1063
01:54:05.500 --> 01:54:12.500
They have a higher multiplier after 20 years to encourage people to stick around.

1064
01:54:12.500 --> 01:54:14.500
Thank you, Madam Chair.

1065
01:54:14.500 --> 01:54:34.500
The, I have a question kind of out of left field, but we heard some stories earlier today about some of the extraordinary things that agencies are doing to hire or try to fill these open positions that they have.

1066
01:54:34.500 --> 01:54:41.500
Should we put any ominous restrictions in place through either legislative action or administration?

1067
01:54:41.500 --> 01:55:13.000
they have have we put any ominous restrictions in place through either legislative action or administrative action that limits retirees from being hired back it says that yeah you're retired but if you want to come back and work as a retired firefighter or as a retired prison guard or whatever, we'll welcome you to do that without giving severe penalties to the...

1068
01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:16.500
There are annual limitations on work hours.

1069
01:55:16.500 --> 01:55:26.500
So if you were to retire now, you can come back to work up to 1,352 hours per calendar year.

1070
01:55:26.500 --> 01:55:30.500
That equates to about 26 hours a week.

1071
01:55:30.500 --> 01:56:30.000
if you had retired prior to 2019 you can work up to 1664 which equates to 32 hours a week those rehirees aren't penalized with everything not as long as they stay they can collect their pension work part-time as long as they stay below those hourly limits if they go over then they will be their pension will be docked for 12 months in the next year uh by approximately 50 does that need to be reviewed it was we took there yes we talked about it there is no restriction on a retiree choosing to come back to work full time it's only if they want to collect their pension and work part-time that there are limitations.

1072
01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
Okay, thank you.

1073
01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:39.000
And they're free to work in the private sector as much as they want.

1074
01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:48.500
Yes, or go across one of the borders and work for a government in Massachusetts or Maine or wherever.

1075
01:56:48.500 --> 01:56:50.500
Okay.

1076
01:56:50.500 --> 01:56:52.500
Other questions?

1077
01:56:52.500 --> 01:56:54.500
All right.

1078
01:56:54.500 --> 01:56:56.500
Thank you very much.

1079
01:56:56.500 --> 01:56:58.500
You're welcome.

1080
01:56:58.500 --> 01:57:00.500
Brian Rill.

1081
01:57:00.500 --> 01:57:04.500
Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the committee.

1082
01:57:04.500 --> 01:57:10.000
I promise this is the last time you'll see me today.

1083
01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:25.000
My name is Brian Rowe, and once again, I serve as the president of Professional Firefighters in New Hampshire, and I'm a captain for the city of Portsmouth Fire Department.

1084
01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:44.500
You know, it's been mentioned a couple times before, but our job here with the professional firefighters is to advocate for the men and women that serve the citizens of this state every single day, without question, without fail.

1085
01:57:44.500 --> 01:57:56.500
And the least we can do is take a look at some of these retirement changes in 2011 and try to make it right.

1086
01:57:56.500 --> 01:58:04.000
I sit before you today in full support of hospital 449 relative to the couch.

1087
01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:08.500
changes in 2011 and try to make it right.

1088
01:58:08.500 --> 01:58:20.500
I sit before you today in full support of House Bill 449 relative to the calculation of Group 2 retirement benefits in our system.

1089
01:58:20.500 --> 01:58:40.000
Today I speak to you not only as a proud leader of some of the bravest men and women in our state, but also someone who is a profound concern for the future of public safety in New Hampshire.

1090
01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:52.500
A noble calling that was once highly desirable continues to suffer in the face of a recruitment and retention epidemic like none we've ever seen.

1091
01:58:52.500 --> 01:59:03.000
In the mid to late 2000s as I mentioned earlier New Hampshire's fire state entrance exam saw well over 4500 candidates.

1092
01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:14.000
Many of those candidates came in with brand new fire science degree, associate's degree from the Tech College here in New Hampshire.

1093
01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.500
Some had a paramedic certificate.

1094
01:59:16.500 --> 01:59:24.000
In either case, they were highly desirable and highly marketable to the average fire department.

1095
01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:33.000
And despite this, most often struggled to find a job in what was once a highly competitive market.

1096
01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:46.500
Now that very same test that's yielding approximately 60% fewer candidates, many fire departments are left unable to hire enough qualified applicants to fill their open positions.

1097
01:59:46.500 --> 02:00:02.000
And these lack of new recruits joining the ranks, those that are in the fire service are being asked in many cases told to have to work more, to do more.

1098
02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:17.000
And this has created a volatile situation, which has resulted in the loss of highly qualified and experienced personnel, with an underwhelming number of candidates ready to fill these positions.

1099
02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:29.500
When dedicating oneself to a career in public service, most recognize that they do so for a modest wage, fair benefits, and a dignified retirement.

1100
02:00:29.500 --> 02:00:36.000
Unfortunately, I'm here to tell you today that the latter no longer exists.

1101
02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:49.000
In fact, over the years, the expectations of this job have become much higher than ever before, the risks far greater, and the retirement less enticing.

1102
02:00:49.000 --> 02:01:00.500
Madam Chair, members of the committee, I can say with incredible certainty that this is the reason for our recruitment and retention crisis.

1103
02:01:00.500 --> 02:01:07.500
In 2022, the Department of Safety established a Recruitment and Retention Ad Hoc Committee.

1104
02:01:07.500 --> 02:01:11.000
That report is now in your inbox.

1105
02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:29.500
That committee recommended supporting initiatives and legislations that ensured retirement security for members of the New Hampshire retirement system, such as, but not limited to, returning the New Hampshire retirement system benefit structure to the pre-2011 levels.

1106
02:01:29.500 --> 02:01:54.500
House Bill 449 not only represents a partial restoration of a benefit that was once removed from members in 2011, but it is the one singular retirement bill being heard by this committee that positively impacts all firefighters, police officers, and corrections personnel, not just those in that sliding scale.

1107
02:01:54.500 --> 02:02:07.500
Passing this legislation shows that the committee recognizes New Hampshire's recruitment and retention crisis and is willing to make meaningful, impactful changes to stop the bleeding.

1108
02:02:07.500 --> 02:02:18.500
I would urge this committee's full support to send House Bill 449 to the subcommittee so that this can be further reviewed.

1109
02:02:18.500 --> 02:02:21.500
And I would take any questions.

1110
02:02:21.500 --> 02:02:23.500
Thank you.

1111
02:02:23.500 --> 02:02:26.000
Thank you for your testimony.

1112
02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
Are there any questions?

1113
02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:32.000
Professor Angerhard, do you have a quick help?

1114
02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
Okay.

1115
02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:37.500
In that case, thank you very much.

1116
02:02:37.500 --> 02:02:39.500
Thank you.

1117
02:02:39.500 --> 02:02:41.500
Frank Campo?

1118
02:02:41.500 --> 02:02:43.500
Thank you.

1119
02:02:43.500 --> 02:02:45.500
There we go.

1120
02:02:45.500 --> 02:02:49.000
Good afternoon, Madam Chair and committee members.

1121
02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.500
My name is Frank Campo.

1122
02:02:51.500 --> 02:03:33.000
I'm a sergeant with the state police and i serve as the president of the new hampshire troopers association you've heard a great deal today about the serious recruitment and retention problems law enforcement's having and i'd like to put this into perspective for you all a little bit currently the state police has about 70 vacancies which puts us at nearly a 20 vacancy rate this is as serious a problem as I've ever seen in my 20 years in law enforcement.

1123
02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:42.500
Recruitment is extremely difficult and troopers are leaving and retiring and creating a serious retention problem that we're having.

1124
02:03:42.500 --> 02:03:50.000
We strongly believe that making changes to the retirement system can help address this problem.

1125
02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:56.500
The bill before you, House Bill 449, is one approach that will help.

1126
02:03:56.500 --> 02:04:14.500
Increasing the service retirement and disability retirement annuity multiplier for the first 20 years of service for Group 2 system members under the transitions adopted in 2011 will serve as a strong incentive to stay longer.

1127
02:04:14.500 --> 02:04:20.500
And this is a goal that we should all be working for.

1128
02:04:20.500 --> 02:04:35.500
And I realize that you have a lot of bills and ideas before you that would make changes to the retirement to help deal with the recruitment and retention problem.

1129
02:04:35.500 --> 02:04:49.000
The men and the women who make up the state police would appreciate it if you would weigh each of these bills with that goal in mind.

1130
02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:55.000
If not this bill, there are other approaches in front of you.

1131
02:04:55.000 --> 02:05:00.500
And I would just like to address one issue that Mr.

1132
02:05:00.500 --> 02:05:07.000
Kavanaugh spoke of earlier, that these bills will not do much for retention.

1133
02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:10.000
I would wholeheartedly disagree with that.

1134
02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:30.500
I can think off the top of my head right now, five or six of my friends, other troopers that had 10 plus years on with the division have left because of the changes to the retirement system that took place.

1135
02:05:30.500 --> 02:05:35.000
It simply wasn't worth it for them to stay.

1136
02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:37.000
So they simply left.

1137
02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:55.500
And if there's anything that you can remember from my testimony today, I hope it is that we have a serious problem and it's getting worse and adjusting retirement benefits can have a positive impact towards this.

1138
02:05:55.500 --> 02:05:57.500
Thank you.

1139
02:05:57.500 --> 02:06:02.500
And I can take any questions if there are any.

1140
02:06:02.500 --> 02:06:04.500
Representative Brody.

1141
02:06:04.500 --> 02:06:06.500
Representative Brody.

1142
02:06:06.500 --> 02:06:08.500
Thank you.

1143
02:06:08.500 --> 02:06:15.500
I'm sympathetic to the situation and I agree that something has to be done.

1144
02:06:15.500 --> 02:06:23.000
My concern is that we have a 20 percent vacancy rate over the state agencies.

1145
02:06:23.000 --> 02:07:02.000
So how sure are you that returning the or passing this legislation will indeed allow you to hire individuals how is that pool going to get bigger sure well i think um what you what you get is you know we always remember or we always know kind of growing up as kids that um the um the um retirement for police officers is excellent and this has been watered down for the past 10 years or so.

1146
02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:10.000
And what has happened is you're starting to see that it's now starting to catch up.

1147
02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:18.000
These people are understanding that, okay, I guess the retirement in New Hampshire isn't that good.

1148
02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:24.000
We're not going to go into law enforcement service in New Hampshire.

1149
02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:37.000
Maybe if we want to, we'll go elsewhere to another adjoining state or maybe to the federal level or maybe not get into law enforcement whatsoever.

1150
02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:42.500
It will take some time, I think, to turn this around.

1151
02:07:42.500 --> 02:07:58.000
But if some of these benefits begin to get restored and people start to understand that the retirement is worth it up here in New Hampshire, they're going to come back.

1152
02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000
Yes.

1153
02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:13.500
And you think that this type of legislation or this kind of benefit increase or return back to normal is going to be enough to do that?

1154
02:08:13.500 --> 02:08:15.500
I do.

1155
02:08:15.500 --> 02:08:18.000
I think it would be.

1156
02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:31.000
And I certainly I know it would be enough to retain the employees that we had these, you know, the handful that I spoke of earlier.

1157
02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:50.500
earlier these are gentlemen with 10 plus years on the job they left here with um you know a lot of experience a lot of training, and you can't put a number on, you know, making that back up.

1158
02:08:50.500 --> 02:08:52.500
I agree.

1159
02:08:52.500 --> 02:08:54.500
Thank you so much.

1160
02:08:54.500 --> 02:08:56.500
Representative Dolan.

1161
02:08:56.500 --> 02:08:58.500
Thank you, Mr.

1162
02:08:58.500 --> 02:09:00.500
Chair.

1163
02:09:00.500 --> 02:09:13.000
From a state police viewpoint, my question is going to be, I know we have a similar problem in Rockingham County with the nursing home.

1164
02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:19.000
Our nursing home is hiring nurses and maintaining a full staff there.

1165
02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:28.000
So they've done some extraordinary things with tuition reimbursement, bonuses, and so forth to aid in the recruitment.

1166
02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:38.000
My question to you is, again, as a state trooper, do you think those types of efforts would be effective?

1167
02:09:38.000 --> 02:11:04.500
It seems like right now we're hoping people are our we're hoping people are higher on and we got our fingers crossed what about extraordinary personnel actions to that maybe we could give to the subcommittee to look at like you can be as creative as you want bonuses tuition certain things to attract a larger pool that may be going off to maine or going off to massachusetts or whatever to for their jobs sure i'm not sure um i don't have a good answer on that i can say that um we currently the state police has a ten thousand dollar recruitment bonus and um it seems as if recruitment has picked up a little bit i don't have any numbers on this but i will also say that i know in this last class of recruits that we hired half of them didn't even know we that we had that recruitment bonus so i don't know how effective something like that um would be thank you thank Thank you, Mr.

1168
02:11:04.500 --> 02:11:06.500
Chair.

1169
02:11:06.500 --> 02:11:08.500
Representative Hebert.

1170
02:11:08.500 --> 02:11:10.500
Thank you, Mr.

1171
02:11:10.500 --> 02:11:12.500
Chair.

1172
02:11:12.500 --> 02:11:24.000
One of the first tasks that I had was a meeting with our local fire chief and our local police chief in Pelham.

1173
02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:32.500
And we're on a border town where we're losing quite a few officers and firefighters to Massachusetts.

1174
02:11:32.500 --> 02:11:39.500
Do you know if we put this in place, how it compares to Massachusetts?

1175
02:11:39.500 --> 02:11:49.000
And would this be the fix or would this be, would this continue to be a problem next year?

1176
02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:53.000
We're going to see this again next year.

1177
02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000
Thank you.

1178
02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000
I don't know.

1179
02:11:57.000 --> 02:12:01.500
I can't say that it would be a fix.

1180
02:12:01.500 --> 02:12:05.500
I could certainly say it would be helpful.

1181
02:12:05.500 --> 02:12:17.000
I honestly don't know what the retirement system down in Massachusetts looks like, so I wouldn't really be able to speak to that.

1182
02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:24.500
But I do know we've had several troopers leave to go specifically down to Massachusetts.

1183
02:12:24.500 --> 02:12:30.000
And the retirement portion of it really never enters the conversation.

1184
02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000
Mr.

1185
02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
Chair, follow-up?

1186
02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.000
Yes.

1187
02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.000
Thank you.

1188
02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:44.500
So can you or someone in this room get that information to us?

1189
02:12:44.500 --> 02:12:46.500
I can, yes.

1190
02:12:46.500 --> 02:12:48.500
Thank you.

1191
02:12:48.500 --> 02:12:54.500
can you or someone in this room get that information to us?

1192
02:12:54.500 --> 02:12:56.500
I can, yes.

1193
02:12:56.500 --> 02:12:58.500
Other questions?

1194
02:12:58.500 --> 02:13:06.000
Thank you very much for your testimony, and I apologize for having been called out.

1195
02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
Art Beaudry.

1196
02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:15.000
Madam Chairman, members of the committee for the record, my name is Arthur Beaudry.

1197
02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:20.000
I represent the New Hampshire State Permanent Firefighters Retirement Association.

1198
02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:33.000
And I am a retired captain from the Manchester Fire Department, and I was a board member of the New Hampshire Retirement System Board of Trustees.

1199
02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:38.000
And I am here in favor of House Bill 449.

1200
02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:46.000
I'm not going to say a lot because I think a lot has already been said.

1201
02:13:46.000 --> 02:14:00.500
I would be willing to work with the subcommittee on all this legislation to try to get back the benefits that were lost to the members prior to 2011.

1202
02:14:00.500 --> 02:14:07.500
This transitional period, it was unprecedented at the time for benefits to be retroactive.

1203
02:14:07.500 --> 02:14:32.500
If you look at what they did for Group 1 in the same year, and I'm reading right out of the statute that for Group 1, provided, however, Group 1 members who commence service on or after July 1, 2011, shall not reserve service retirement until they reach age 65.

1204
02:14:32.500 --> 02:14:35.000
They didn't touch their multiplier.

1205
02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:47.000
So on Group 2, they eliminated the multiple, not eliminated, but they lowered the multiplier, plus they raised the age and years of service.

1206
02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:50.500
So you're working longer for less money.

1207
02:14:50.500 --> 02:14:54.000
They didn't do that with group one.

1208
02:14:54.000 --> 02:15:01.000
And with group one, it was anybody after July 1 of 11 was affected.

1209
02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:10.000
If you were before that, they didn't say if you weren't vested like it is in Group 2.

1210
02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:16.500
So I don't know why they did what they did to Group 2.

1211
02:15:16.500 --> 02:15:23.500
But we would like to see those benefits retained and reimbursed to our members.

1212
02:15:23.500 --> 02:15:37.000
And again, we would be willing to work with the committee and all this legislation to try to get what is fair and equitable to our members.

1213
02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:43.500
And like I said, it's been unprecedented to have something retroactive taken away.

1214
02:15:43.500 --> 02:15:46.000
And I'll answer any questions.

1215
02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.500
Thank you for your testimony.

1216
02:15:48.500 --> 02:15:50.500
Are there any questions?

1217
02:15:50.500 --> 02:15:52.500
Representative Garhart.

1218
02:15:52.500 --> 02:15:54.500
Thank you, Madam Chair.

1219
02:15:54.500 --> 02:16:05.500
It seems like, from what I've heard so far, I'm new to this, obviously, the retirement system is in a complete mess.

1220
02:16:05.500 --> 02:16:21.000
So would you be, are you supportive of having the individual members deal with their own retirement instead of giving it up to the state and having them deal with it?

1221
02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:25.500
Are you suggesting going to a defined contribution plan?

1222
02:16:25.500 --> 02:16:33.500
I'm just saying giving individual members the ability to decide what to do with their retirement.

1223
02:16:33.500 --> 02:16:40.500
I would oppose going to any other benefit other than the defined benefit plan.

1224
02:16:40.500 --> 02:17:11.000
Not to say that our members are not smart enough to take care of their own finances, but I can tell you there are a lot of people that will look at that part of money and they'll go out and buy an RV or buy a new car and then when it comes to retirement, they don't have any money.

1225
02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:20.000
So we're supportive of the defined benefit plan, and I would not support any other type of benefit.

1226
02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
Thank you.

1227
02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
Other questions?

1228
02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:27.500
Seeing none, thank you for your testimony.

1229
02:17:27.500 --> 02:17:33.500
Is there anyone else who wishes to testify on House Bill 449?

1230
02:17:33.500 --> 02:17:35.500
Okay.

1231
02:17:35.500 --> 02:17:57.500
Seeing none, I will close the public hearing hearing this bill is going to subcommittee and i was called out for an emergency scheduling meeting and the that subcommittee will be meeting next thursday afternoon if not sooner the speaker anticipates a short session.

1232
02:17:57.500 --> 02:18:03.500
So after the session, the subcommittee will be meeting on these bills.

1233
02:18:03.500 --> 02:18:05.500
All right.

1234
02:18:05.500 --> 02:18:09.500
I'm opening the hearing on House Bill 525.

1235
02:18:09.500 --> 02:18:11.500
Representative Pratt.

1236
02:18:11.500 --> 02:18:14.500
Looks like I cleared the room.

1237
02:18:14.500 --> 02:18:16.500
Thank you, Madam.

1238
02:18:16.500 --> 02:18:18.500
How effective of you.

1239
02:18:18.500 --> 02:18:22.000
Thank you for having let me speak.

1240
02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:26.000
This is going to be on Bill 525.

1241
02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:33.500
And listening to the previous speakers, I was negligent in not mentioning my past career.

1242
02:18:33.500 --> 02:18:40.000
I was a fire chief for 29 years and a fireman for 42.

1243
02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:50.000
And I was a commercial fireman for Seabrook Nuclear Power Plant as senior fire brigade leader for five five years.

1244
02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:58.000
And 18 years I was a fire standards and training commissioner at fire standards and training.

1245
02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:16.000
I did see the years where we had so many people, we had to hire extra trucks and extra people to put classes on, or the tests on, to hire people to put on the list.

1246
02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:51.000
And then I was there when they, 2011, when they changed everything, and the numbers went down and down on the people put in for the job so that made the list smaller and smaller and it did force the cities to go looking elsewhere for their people and a lot of them took them from smaller towns which is a natural order of things but it increased after 2011.

1247
02:19:51.000 --> 02:20:00.500
also i heard earlier a statement this bill is very close to the bill I already mentioned earlier today.

1248
02:20:00.500 --> 02:20:08.500
So I heard earlier that there was an increase in hiring of 60% in the system.

1249
02:20:08.500 --> 02:20:24.500
That was probably true because it was a mass exodus in 2011, 2012, right after the bill got changed, the retirement system got bad, so bad that a lot of people left.

1250
02:20:24.500 --> 02:21:11.500
They were concerned that they couldn't trust the system that it would change again and they wanted to get out so we lost a lot of people that were trained right after that happened so there probably was an increase of 60% but that was probably after we had 60% light leave so that's just need to put that in perspective so So this bill, 525, adjusts the application of the minimum age, the minimum years of service, and the annuity multipliers to the transition provisions of group two service retirement adopted in 2011.

1251
02:21:11.500 --> 02:21:16.000
So if you look at the financial claim here.

1252
02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:24.500
So as we did before, we changed the date from 2012 to 2014 in a couple places.

1253
02:21:24.500 --> 02:21:33.500
But the real story is down in the chart, and that's lines 14 through 23 on the bill.

1254
02:21:33.500 --> 02:21:47.500
The ages on this bill stays the same, and the years of service stays the same, but the multiplier was the only thing that changed in this bill.

1255
02:21:47.500 --> 02:21:53.500
So it's very close to the other bill except for those changes.

1256
02:21:53.500 --> 02:22:03.500
And as before I mentioned, the only way you can get numbers from the actuary is to file a bill.

1257
02:22:03.500 --> 02:22:29.500
so this gives us a little bit different numbers on the bills and the financial statements in the first one uh let's see if there's any other points i wanted to make and it's been brought up already that um after 2011 towns and firefighters were paying more into the retirement system.

1258
02:22:29.500 --> 02:22:33.000
The state was paying zero after that.

1259
02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:39.000
And we were paying more in, both the towns and the individuals.

1260
02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:48.000
And we were working longer, years, and ended up getting less out of the retirement system, less compensation.

1261
02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:53.500
So pay more and get less was what happened after 2011.

1262
02:22:53.500 --> 02:22:56.500
So that statement I'll verify also.

1263
02:22:56.500 --> 02:22:58.500
And any questions?

1264
02:22:58.500 --> 02:23:00.500
I don't see any.

1265
02:23:00.500 --> 02:23:03.000
Thank you for your testimony.

1266
02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:05.000
Mr.

1267
02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:08.500
Cavanaugh, do you have anything to add?

1268
02:23:08.500 --> 02:23:10.500
We see.

1269
02:23:10.500 --> 02:23:35.000
um mr kavanaugh do you have anything to add this is the same as the bill we first entertained after lunch with the exception that the age and years of service don't change uh the difference in cost is between that bill and this bill is very, very slight.

1270
02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:43.000
You can compare the fiscal notes, but very little difference, that adjustment, one or 2% difference.

1271
02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:47.000
The change in the multiplier is more significant.

1272
02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:49.000
Is that correct?

1273
02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:51.000
Correct.

1274
02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:58.000
Versus allowing someone to retire one year earlier by changing the age and service.

1275
02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:00.000
That's all I had.

1276
02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:02.500
I'm open to any questions.

1277
02:24:02.500 --> 02:24:04.500
I'll keep this moving.

1278
02:24:04.500 --> 02:24:06.500
Okay.

1279
02:24:06.500 --> 02:24:09.000
Not seeing old representative True.

1280
02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:14.500
Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you for taking my question.

1281
02:24:14.500 --> 02:24:20.000
So on this bill, 449, this basically applies to current employees?

1282
02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.000
Yes.

1283
02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:29.000
It applies to employees who were active on 7-1-11 but not vested by 1-1-12.

1284
02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:37.500
So people who had between 0 and 9.9 years of service when the law changed in 2012.

1285
02:24:37.500 --> 02:24:39.500
Yes.

1286
02:24:39.500 --> 02:24:49.500
No retired member is affected by any of these bills because once you decide to retire, your pension is set.

1287
02:24:49.500 --> 02:24:51.500
Correct.

1288
02:24:51.500 --> 02:24:53.500
Okay.

1289
02:24:53.500 --> 02:24:55.500
Any other questions?

1290
02:24:55.500 --> 02:24:57.500
All right.

1291
02:24:57.500 --> 02:24:59.500
525.

1292
02:24:59.500 --> 02:25:01.500
Mr.

1293
02:25:01.500 --> 02:25:03.500
Regasa?

1294
02:25:03.500 --> 02:25:05.500
Yes.

1295
02:25:05.500 --> 02:25:07.500
Ah, good.

1296
02:25:07.500 --> 02:25:12.500
I pronounced it close enough that you could recognize it.

1297
02:25:12.500 --> 02:25:14.500
Good afternoon, everyone.

1298
02:25:14.500 --> 02:25:37.500
So, instead of speaking for all these four great bills that are before us, what I will do is I'll save you all the time, and then I'll save myself a time as I have to work second shift, and I'll testify and I'll run out.

1299
02:25:37.500 --> 02:25:40.000
My name is Seyfiel Ragasa.

1300
02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:47.000
I am the president of the New Hampshire Probation Pro Officers Command Staff Union.

1301
02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:54.500
And I am one of the affected people by the previous bill back in 2011.

1302
02:25:54.500 --> 02:25:56.500
So why these bills?

1303
02:25:56.500 --> 02:25:59.500
Why are we supporting these bills?

1304
02:25:59.500 --> 02:26:09.000
first and foremost, as you all know, we have been affected greatly and we are dealing with recruitment issues.

1305
02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:18.000
Currently, our agency, the Department of Correction, is offering $10,000 bonus just to bring people through the door.

1306
02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:29.000
And unfortunately, it isn't the $10,000 people want, it is more of that stability what other states that are offering next door.

1307
02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:39.000
And the challenge we are having is that our competitors next door are treating our state as a recruitment depot.

1308
02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:47.000
What we do is we hire employee, whether it is a police officer, a correctional officer.

1309
02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:49.000
We hire them.

1310
02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:51.000
We train them.

1311
02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:55.500
The state spends up to $100,000 plus a year.

1312
02:26:55.500 --> 02:27:06.000
And then as soon as they got that certificate, they moved it to the next state, right next door in Massachusetts.

1313
02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:11.000
They are hiring them for 20 years service and exchange.

1314
02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:21.500
What that does is we are losing now these trained personnel that were supposed to stay here, help here, contribute here.

1315
02:27:21.500 --> 02:27:26.000
Now we're losing them to the state next door.

1316
02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:44.000
I have currently about six or seven individuals on the waiting list on Massachusetts Department of Correction and we're gonna lose from the Department of Correction that we have personnel that we cannot afford to lose.

1317
02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:57.500
I, as a parole officer, right after this testimony, I'm going to stand a post and cover a post at the prison because they are understaffed regularly.

1318
02:27:57.500 --> 02:28:01.500
So these $10,000 incentives are not helping us.

1319
02:28:01.500 --> 02:28:18.000
The other troubling factor is that aside from my full-time job, I'm an urgent professor with Southern New Hampshire University and like every term I ask students, what do you want to do?

1320
02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:21.000
What's your goal when you graduate?

1321
02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:34.500
I get 15 out of 21 students telling me that as soon as they graduate, they go to the next state or to the federal government system.

1322
02:28:34.500 --> 02:28:39.500
Mainly it is because the retirement is no longer glamorous.

1323
02:28:39.500 --> 02:28:44.000
It's no longer a career, it's rather a job.

1324
02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:51.000
Years ago it was a career, 20-year career, so you came in, professional environment.

1325
02:28:51.000 --> 02:29:12.500
And one of the students have told me what his father had told him, that in 2012 his father was actually one of the affected person the rug was taken underneath from his feet and Who will basically fall was the same group?

1326
02:29:12.500 --> 02:30:00.000
So We are really this is this are the multiple layer of effect the recruitment being one of them losing an educated group of people and More importantly we're losing this youngster who are the contributing factors of this society so uh the bill was intended to help state save money i don't know how much was but i'm sure we have accomplished whatever we needed to accomplish back i don't think there was any lawmaker who was intent to create this shortage of staff in in a police and a correctional facility, state police.

1327
02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:23.000
That wasn't the intended goal, but we now realize that intended goal, we did not accomplish what we wanted to accomplish while we continue to lose our training personnel and we're being treated as a recruitment institution by other states, right within the New England area.

1328
02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:32.000
So I urge you all to consider what happened, not only to fix it, but also to reinsure.

1329
02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:40.000
The decision made that in 2012, it was a decision to stabilize the state retirement system.

1330
02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:50.500
But then we still have people with a bad taste in their mouths that they were hired under 20 years contract.

1331
02:30:50.500 --> 02:31:08.000
And then nine years after they work, just because they didn't have that two months to be vested, they were told, oh, sorry, the promise we made you many years ago is no longer valid.

1332
02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:15.500
Once the good governor Sununu had told me that promise made so our promise kept.

1333
02:31:15.500 --> 02:31:34.000
I think it is time for the men and women that are serving this state, it is time for us to show them that what we promised you when you were hired is what you will get.

1334
02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:46.000
And those who come in understanding what their hiring condition is even will be treated better, mainly because we want them to stay here.

1335
02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:48.500
I compare numbers of incidents.

1336
02:31:48.500 --> 02:31:54.000
I am an instructor in many disciplines, especially use of force.

1337
02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:57.500
I compare our officers' incidents, our streets.

1338
02:31:57.500 --> 02:32:00.500
We are almost second to none.

1339
02:32:00.500 --> 02:32:06.000
We have the best officers that we cannot afford to lose.

1340
02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:45.000
But we're losing our officers because of the retirement system, which isn't working and which is no longer appealing so uh i strongly support any any bill that you guys bring to correct that damage it is a damage uh i am a forgiving person and i will say that it was intended to work well but it didn't it is time to change it and i will take any question any of you might have for me.

1341
02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:47.500
Thank you for your testimony.

1342
02:32:47.500 --> 02:32:49.500
Are there questions?

1343
02:32:49.500 --> 02:32:51.500
Senator Dolan?

1344
02:32:51.500 --> 02:32:56.500
Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you for taking questions.

1345
02:32:56.500 --> 02:33:06.500
My question is, as we look at probably the worst inflation that the country has seen in over 40 years.

1346
02:33:06.500 --> 02:33:08.500
Are we doing enough?

1347
02:33:08.500 --> 02:33:18.500
The Fed's response for Social Security recipients is to increase their Social Security by in excess of 8% this year.

1348
02:33:18.500 --> 02:33:33.000
Are we doing enough in the state to help our police officers and similar professions deal with this scourge of inflation that they're dealing with in their home economy?

1349
02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:41.000
So if we are comparing apple to apple with neighboring states, no, we're not doing enough.

1350
02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:55.000
We also, in 2011, when we changed that bill didn't just change it also changed the contribution of firemen and law enforcement officers to the state retirement system.

1351
02:33:55.000 --> 02:34:02.500
So my answer will be no we're not really doing enough for our first responders.

1352
02:34:02.500 --> 02:34:04.500
Thank you.

1353
02:34:04.500 --> 02:34:10.000
I'm not sure that relates to this bill but go on.

1354
02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:22.000
I wonder if you might be prepared during the subcommittee portion of this to bring forth whatever recommendations you might have for the state.

1355
02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:24.000
Absolutely.

1356
02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:26.000
With regard to that.

1357
02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:28.000
Absolutely.

1358
02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:30.000
Thank you.

1359
02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:32.000
Other questions?

1360
02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:34.000
All right.

1361
02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:38.500
Seeing none, thank you very much for your testimony.

1362
02:34:38.500 --> 02:34:59.000
Thank very much madam all right does anyone else wish to testify on house bill 525 all right seeing none i will close the public hearing and without objection we'll go into executive session representative Representative Grotter, you have a motion?

1363
02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:01.000
I do.

1364
02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:06.000
I have a motion of ITL on House Bill 525.

1365
02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:08.000
And I'll second that.

1366
02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:20.000
I hope that the committee will support the motion because I find 525 and the House Bill 436, as the sponsor said, remarkably similar.

1367
02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:27.000
And I think we can work with one of these bills, and that's why.

1368
02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:30.500
I just don't think we need both.

1369
02:35:30.500 --> 02:35:43.500
And I'd like to say that because they address the same sections of law in very much the same way, we can't pass both of them.

1370
02:35:43.500 --> 02:35:46.000
They conflict with each other.

1371
02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:56.500
So we're holding, we will be working on 536 and keep the concepts of 525 in mind while we do so.

1372
02:35:56.500 --> 02:35:59.500
Does anyone else have a comment?

1373
02:35:59.500 --> 02:36:01.500
Okay.

1374
02:36:01.500 --> 02:36:09.500
In that case, the motion is inexpedient to legislate and the clerk can call the roll.

1375
02:36:09.500 --> 02:36:11.500
Representative Bailey.

1376
02:36:11.500 --> 02:36:13.500
Yes.

1377
02:36:13.500 --> 02:36:15.500
Representative True.

1378
02:36:15.500 --> 02:36:17.500
Yes.

1379
02:36:17.500 --> 02:36:19.500
Representative True.

1380
02:36:19.500 --> 02:36:21.500
Yes.

1381
02:36:21.500 --> 02:36:23.500
Representative Dolan.

1382
02:36:23.500 --> 02:36:25.500
Yes.

1383
02:36:25.500 --> 02:36:27.500
Representative LeBear.

1384
02:36:27.500 --> 02:36:29.500
Yes.

1385
02:36:29.500 --> 02:36:31.500
Representative Gerhardt.

1386
02:36:31.500 --> 02:36:33.500
Yes.

1387
02:36:33.500 --> 02:36:35.500
The clerk votes yes.

1388
02:36:35.500 --> 02:36:37.500
Representative Grota.

1389
02:36:37.500 --> 02:36:39.500
Yes.

1390
02:36:39.500 --> 02:36:41.500
Representative Schuett.

1391
02:36:41.500 --> 02:36:46.000
He was here when the question was called, yes.

1392
02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:48.000
He was.

1393
02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:50.000
Representative Coley.

1394
02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:52.000
Yes.

1395
02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:54.000
Representative Schuett.

1396
02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:56.000
Yes.

1397
02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:58.000
Representative Wilhelm.

1398
02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:00.000
Yes.

1399
02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:02.000
Representative Davis.

1400
02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:04.000
Yes.

1401
02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:06.000
Representative Fitzpatrick.

1402
02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:08.000
Yes.

1403
02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:10.000
And the chair.

1404
02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:12.000
Yes.

1405
02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:17.000
And we have a vote of 13 yay, zero nay.

1406
02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:19.000
Okay.

1407
02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:22.000
Is there any objection to consent?

1408
02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:24.000
Okay.

1409
02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:30.000
I don't think that there can be because it's a fiscal note.

1410
02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:36.000
If the motion is ITL, you can put a bill on consent.

1411
02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:38.000
Okay.

1412
02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:41.000
You just can bill on consent.

1413
02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:43.000
Okay.

1414
02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:45.500
You just can't pass it.

1415
02:37:45.500 --> 02:37:47.500
Okay.

1416
02:37:47.500 --> 02:37:51.000
And at your earliest convenience, Representative Grotta.

1417
02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:53.000
All right.

1418
02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:59.000
Leaving the executive session, I'll open the hearing on House Bill 579.

1419
02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:01.000
And Representative Trotier.

1420
02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:06.000
Good afternoon, Madam Chair and members of the ED&A Committee.

1421
02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:55.500
I am Representative Douglas Trotier, Belknap County District 8, which represents the towns of belmont tilton and sambiton today i come before you with house bill 579 i understand that this committee has heard several bills today on the retirement system so i'm going to make this very brief you've heard testimonies about the um changes back in 2011 that took effect in 2012 so this bill would eliminate the 2011 transition provision from the group to retirement returning it back to what it was prior to those changes for members that were hired before july 1 of 2011.

1422
02:38:55.500 --> 02:39:25.000
this bill would anybody hired after that it would remain the same those changes did as many of people have testified today had changed the age the number of years they had to do, the calculations, and most of those that were hired before 2011 had an understanding, verbal contract, of what they would receive from the retirement system.

1423
02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:35.500
So I'm asking that this committee submit this bill for consideration or to be added to the subcommittee for further consideration.

1424
02:39:35.500 --> 02:39:37.500
Thank you.

1425
02:39:37.500 --> 02:39:41.000
Are there any questions from the committee?

1426
02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:45.500
I don't see any, so thank you very much.

1427
02:39:45.500 --> 02:39:48.000
Thank you for your consideration.

1428
02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:50.000
Mr.

1429
02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:53.500
Cavanaugh, do you need to add anything?

1430
02:39:53.500 --> 02:39:57.500
I'm still Mark Kavanaugh from the retirement system.

1431
02:39:57.500 --> 02:40:23.000
This bill addresses the same issue we've been discussing in the broadest way by eliminating the tier system and restoring everyone who was subject to it, those transition rules, to the law as it existed on 7-1, prior to 7-1-11, which is for age 45, 20 years, and a 2.5 multiplier.

1432
02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:27.500
Consequently, it's the most expensive of the bills, unfortunately.

1433
02:40:27.500 --> 02:40:37.000
$6.5 million estimated increase in contributions for the state in fiscal year 26, $25.88 million for the political subdivisions.

1434
02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:41.000
That would be an annual cost going forward.

1435
02:40:41.000 --> 02:41:07.500
And it also would increase the actuarial accrued liabilities by 226 million dollars uh finally i'd say that each of these bills also has significant administrative challenges in i.t costs the i.t programming costs will range between 100 and000 for each of these bills, depending on which one makes it through the House.

1436
02:41:07.500 --> 02:41:18.000
In that regard, if any, these bills all try to do the same thing so only one of them can pass.

1437
02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:25.000
And it might be a combination or some variation of what we've discussed today.

1438
02:41:25.000 --> 02:42:22.500
And with that, I open it up for questions okay thank you are there any questions from the committee representative true thank you madam chair thank you for taking my question did you say this adds to the unfunded liability uh 226 million dollars yes okay that's that's if you were to terminally fund the increase in benefits that's how much you'd have to come up with today yes and if you could give me a definition again about terminal terminal funding means paying up front uh the cot the future cost of the increase in benefit as opposed to paying for it over time through annual increases in the contributions paid by the employers.

1439
02:42:22.500 --> 02:42:24.500
MS.

1440
02:42:24.500 --> 02:42:33.500
Instead of $6.5 million from the state every year from 26 ad infinitum, it would be, what, 100-something?

1441
02:42:33.500 --> 02:42:35.500
MR.

1442
02:42:35.500 --> 02:42:37.500
200.

1443
02:42:37.500 --> 02:42:39.500
MS.

1444
02:42:39.500 --> 02:42:41.500
200.

1445
02:42:41.500 --> 02:42:43.500
MS.

1446
02:42:43.500 --> 02:42:46.000
226, I think, is it?

1447
02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:48.000
MS.

1448
02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:51.000
In the lump sum right now.

1449
02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:53.000
now.

1450
02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:57.500
Yeah, 226 would pay for it all up front.

1451
02:42:57.500 --> 02:43:01.500
And the employee contribution would be times 20?

1452
02:43:01.500 --> 02:43:03.500
At least 20, yeah.

1453
02:43:03.500 --> 02:43:05.500
Yeah.

1454
02:43:05.500 --> 02:43:28.500
does the um the largest bulk of group two works for the local municipalities so that's where it would hit hardest so this committee being a policy committee we could use one of the previous bills that we've kept to incorporate some of these thoughts into.

1455
02:43:28.500 --> 02:43:30.500
Certainly.

1456
02:43:30.500 --> 02:43:32.500
Okay, thank you.

1457
02:43:32.500 --> 02:43:40.000
And we do, if it's amended bill, we can do a new fiscal note worksheet.

1458
02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:47.500
And if you had two variations you wanna do, you could do two different amendments.

1459
02:43:47.500 --> 02:43:49.500
Yes.

1460
02:43:49.500 --> 02:43:51.500
And get comparative costs.

1461
02:43:51.500 --> 02:43:55.000
We might well want to do that.

1462
02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:57.000
Yeah.

1463
02:43:57.000 --> 02:44:03.500
You usually need at least a week turnaround on that with the actuaries.

1464
02:44:03.500 --> 02:44:14.500
But would it be fair to say that this bill is about the maximum we could expect for eliminating that transition period?

1465
02:44:14.500 --> 02:44:18.000
Yes, because it fully eliminates it altogether.

1466
02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:20.000
Okay, then.

1467
02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:28.000
The only thing more expensive would be to increase the benefits for new hires after 1-1-12.

1468
02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:34.000
Okay, well, we're not talking about that this week, maybe next week.

1469
02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:36.000
No.

1470
02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:43.500
Well, that's what it was when they were hired, so they weren't promised anything different.

1471
02:44:43.500 --> 02:45:53.500
Okay, so, well, that at least gives us a range of, we don't know exactly where our decisions would lay on that range we've got a range of costs mm-hmm thank you we'd also caution in terms of effective date we're undergoing a computer conversion it's a five-year process we go live with it next January and we run parallel starting in October so you can imagine trying to layer on the administrative reprogramming of both the old and the new system that had to be done we need significant lead time because our staff in our IT people in our outside IT vendors are already at full capacity dealing with our conversion okay well this we'll keep that in mind just need a little time thank you any other questions all right thank you for your testimony Thank you.

1472
02:45:53.500 --> 02:45:55.500
Claudia.

1473
02:45:55.500 --> 02:46:35.500
other questions all right thank you for your testimony thank you uh claudia person or something oh i'm sorry claudia excuse me buddy prescott so i just want to point a clarification i think he said that it was a verbal contract um actually the state retirement system used to send us every single year in the mail just like um i think he used to get from social security I THINK HE SAID THAT IT WAS A VERBAL CONTRACT.

1474
02:46:35.500 --> 02:46:48.500
ACTUALLY, THE STATE RETIREMENT SYSTEM USED TO SEND US EVERY SINGLE YEAR IN THE MAIL, JUST LIKE I THINK HE USED TO GET FROM SOCIAL SECURITY.

1475
02:46:48.500 --> 02:47:04.500
IT WAS AN EXPLANATION OF BENEFITS, JUST LIKE YOU USED TO GET FROM SOCIAL SECURITY, THAT IF YOU CONTINUED IN SERVICE, THIS WOULD BE YOUR BENEFIT AT THE END OF 20 YEARS.

1476
02:47:04.500 --> 02:47:10.000
THEY STOPPED DOING THAT AFTER THE CHANGES WERE MADE IN 2010.

1477
02:47:10.000 --> 02:47:15.500
SO IT WAS ACTUALLY A WRITTEN CONTRACT THAT WAS RENEGED UPON.

1478
02:47:15.500 --> 02:47:17.500
SO IT WAS JUST.

1479
02:47:17.500 --> 02:47:21.500
So it was just a point of clarification.

1480
02:47:21.500 --> 02:47:38.500
And then the other thing is as far as the monetary, currently 100% of those millions of dollars that you're talking about are being borne by, I think it's less than 2,000 first responders.

1481
02:47:38.500 --> 02:47:47.000
So 100% of those costs, and the number goes down every year because we're paying for it.

1482
02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:50.000
So that's all borne upon us.

1483
02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:54.000
These costs are all borne by the employer.

1484
02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:58.500
The employees pay a fixed percentage of their salary.

1485
02:47:58.500 --> 02:48:11.000
Yes, but we're talking about if they were to put our benefits back to what they were, then that would change the dynamics of it.

1486
02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:23.000
But you would not, as employees, you would not have to make any further contributions because none of these affect what your contribution is.

1487
02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:29.000
All right, that's true, but it would also go into our taxes.

1488
02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:32.500
So we currently do pay for it.

1489
02:48:32.500 --> 02:48:34.500
That's true.

1490
02:48:34.500 --> 02:48:37.500
We all still pay for it.

1491
02:48:37.500 --> 02:48:39.500
Agreed.

1492
02:48:39.500 --> 02:48:41.500
Any questions or Mr.

1493
02:48:41.500 --> 02:48:43.500
Scott?

1494
02:48:43.500 --> 02:48:45.500
All right.

1495
02:48:45.500 --> 02:48:48.000
Thank you for the information.

1496
02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:50.000
Thanks.

1497
02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:55.000
Does anyone else wish to testify on House Bill 579?

1498
02:48:55.000 --> 02:48:57.000
All right.

1499
02:48:57.000 --> 02:48:59.000
Seeing not.

1500
02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:03.000
Oh, please introduce yourself and, uh, thank you.

1501
02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:27.000
all right seeing not oh please introduce yourself and uh thank you thank you madam chair my name is john levasseur uh i got hired in 2003 um in corrections uh i did four more years in a smaller police department and then transferred to Manchester Police Department.

1502
02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:32.500
In 2011, when that bill passed, I had nine years on.

1503
02:49:32.500 --> 02:49:35.500
So guys working next to me.

1504
02:49:35.500 --> 02:49:41.500
With 10 years, had a much larger pension for what they did.

1505
02:49:41.500 --> 02:49:48.500
And me working side by side with them, I got a much reduced rate.

1506
02:49:48.500 --> 02:49:51.000
I find it very unfair.

1507
02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:53.000
I signed a contract.

1508
02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:57.500
That was a contract that I had for retirement.

1509
02:49:57.500 --> 02:50:07.500
And I'm looking for this state to back us up here and do the right thing because it was wrong.

1510
02:50:07.500 --> 02:50:09.500
Now, I get it.

1511
02:50:09.500 --> 02:50:12.000
Some people don't like pensions.

1512
02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:14.500
Some people have different views.

1513
02:50:14.500 --> 02:50:18.000
But that's what I signed up for.

1514
02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:33.000
And in nine years on the job, I only had so much time to recoup from my future retirement because this job is not meant to do for 30 years.

1515
02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:35.000
It's not.

1516
02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:37.000
It's not.

1517
02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:39.000
Okay?

1518
02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:41.000
20 years.

1519
02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:44.500
That's what this job asked of me.

1520
02:50:44.500 --> 02:50:50.000
I came to calls, domestics, disputes, stabbing, suicides, you name it.

1521
02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:52.500
It's not an easy job.

1522
02:50:52.500 --> 02:50:58.000
And when that happened, that just took my soul from me.

1523
02:50:58.000 --> 02:51:01.500
I'm currently retiring at 42 years old.

1524
02:51:01.500 --> 02:51:03.500
I'm off this job.

1525
02:51:03.500 --> 02:51:05.500
I'm done.

1526
02:51:05.500 --> 02:51:07.500
Absolutely cooked.

1527
02:51:07.500 --> 02:51:09.500
Absolutely cooked.

1528
02:51:09.500 --> 02:51:13.500
And I'm leaving early and I'm freezing it.

1529
02:51:13.500 --> 02:51:15.500
I'm not sticking around.

1530
02:51:15.500 --> 02:51:27.000
I'm not waiting for this bill, but I am supporting my local, brothers and sisters behind here because it was wrong what happened.

1531
02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:35.500
You guys really need to help us out here and step up and do the right thing.

1532
02:51:35.500 --> 02:51:37.500
We had a contract.

1533
02:51:37.500 --> 02:51:46.000
Please back this up and fight for us just this because it's the right thing to do.

1534
02:51:46.000 --> 02:51:49.000
That's what I ask of you.

1535
02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:51.000
Okay?

1536
02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:53.500
Thank you for your testimony.

1537
02:51:53.500 --> 02:51:55.500
I appreciate it.

1538
02:51:55.500 --> 02:51:57.500
Thank you.

1539
02:51:57.500 --> 02:52:02.500
I don't see any questions, so thank you very much.

1540
02:52:02.500 --> 02:52:04.500
Thank you very much.

1541
02:52:04.500 --> 02:52:06.500
Emmett Mackin.

1542
02:52:06.500 --> 02:52:08.500
Good afternoon.

1543
02:52:08.500 --> 02:52:13.500
Sergeant Emmett Mackin of Manchester Police here representing myself, however.

1544
02:52:13.500 --> 02:52:30.000
I wasn't really going to say anything, but I'm fearing I may not have an opportunity before somebody looks at these bills, so I just wanted to get a few things out there.

1545
02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:52.500
this is a retention issue hands down I came here from out of state I was NYPD officer for five years when I came to the state the number one thing I looked at was a pension system there's no other thing to look at.

1546
02:52:52.500 --> 02:52:58.000
I left a place of good benefits and a good pension.

1547
02:52:58.000 --> 02:53:13.000
And I wasn't going to come here for a lesser benefit or a lesser pension, which is what happened when I had about seven years here and things got changed.

1548
02:53:13.000 --> 02:53:26.000
So if you don't think that this is a word of mouth thing that goes around, there's a whole unwritten world out here with cops, right?

1549
02:53:26.000 --> 02:53:37.000
You don't think I'd go to Massachusetts tomorrow if they gave me a better deal than I have right now in Manchester.

1550
02:53:37.000 --> 02:53:39.500
You better believe I would.

1551
02:53:39.500 --> 02:53:41.500
There's no reason to.

1552
02:53:41.500 --> 02:53:46.500
Why would I not go somewhere better for a payday?

1553
02:53:46.500 --> 02:53:49.500
We already don't have health care.

1554
02:53:49.500 --> 02:53:59.500
There's already a bunch of things that I accepted when I came here that it was not going to get.

1555
02:53:59.500 --> 02:54:05.000
And I made an informed decision when I did come here.

1556
02:54:05.000 --> 02:54:18.000
And then to have six, seven years on the job and have this rug pulled out from under your feet, it's a trust issue with people.

1557
02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:26.000
I've had guys that I know that were looking to come here when they hear that.

1558
02:54:26.000 --> 02:54:30.000
Understandably, they're like, I'm not rolling the dice.

1559
02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:35.500
What if it gets worse six years after I'm there, right?

1560
02:54:35.500 --> 02:54:37.500
It just, it's unprecedented.

1561
02:54:37.500 --> 02:54:46.000
I don't know of any other state that did things the way they did it here, right?

1562
02:54:46.000 --> 02:54:54.000
So there's a chance to correct some of these issues, restore some trust here, you know?

1563
02:54:54.000 --> 02:54:58.500
There's another bill downstairs right now that's affecting us.

1564
02:54:58.500 --> 02:55:02.500
There's bills coming up all the time, right?

1565
02:55:02.500 --> 02:55:08.000
There's a profession under the gun half the time, I think.

1566
02:55:08.000 --> 02:55:10.500
Something happens in California, right?

1567
02:55:10.500 --> 02:55:13.500
We hear about it here, right?

1568
02:55:13.500 --> 02:55:21.500
So we have an extremely professional police and fire and EMS and everything in the state.

1569
02:55:21.500 --> 02:55:30.000
I was blown away by how professional and educated and well-trained everybody was when I got here.

1570
02:55:30.000 --> 02:55:33.000
I don't want to lose that.

1571
02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:38.000
I'm going to have to work with these people, right?

1572
02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:41.000
I want the best coming here.

1573
02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:45.000
I want to continue to have the best.

1574
02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:47.500
I have a family here.

1575
02:55:47.500 --> 02:55:54.000
I want my children to be protected and served by the best people.

1576
02:55:54.000 --> 02:56:06.500
I don't want to lose them to Massachusetts or Maine or New York or California or wherever, you know, because that's what's going to happen.

1577
02:56:06.500 --> 02:56:08.500
That's what's happening now.

1578
02:56:08.500 --> 02:56:13.000
You never saw anybody leave these jobs early, ever.

1579
02:56:13.000 --> 02:56:15.500
I never heard of it.

1580
02:56:15.500 --> 02:56:23.500
I never heard of a cop doing 17 years and pulling the plug in my life.

1581
02:56:23.500 --> 02:56:28.000
You know, I mean, it just never happened before.

1582
02:56:28.000 --> 02:56:30.500
It's happening here in droves.

1583
02:56:30.500 --> 02:56:33.000
I've never seen it before.

1584
02:56:33.000 --> 02:56:36.000
And there's a reason for that.

1585
02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:39.000
There's only one reason for that.

1586
02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:41.000
It's the retirement system.

1587
02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:43.000
It's hands down.

1588
02:56:43.000 --> 02:56:48.000
You know, you can deal with all the other pressures.

1589
02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:51.000
We deal with it every day.

1590
02:56:51.000 --> 02:56:54.500
We try to help each other out.

1591
02:56:54.500 --> 02:57:01.500
But this is the one thing you can't, we have no control over, right?

1592
02:57:01.500 --> 02:57:03.500
You guys do.

1593
02:57:03.500 --> 02:57:06.000
So please help us out.

1594
02:57:06.000 --> 02:57:08.000
Thank you.

1595
02:57:08.000 --> 02:57:11.000
If you have any questions or.

1596
02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:13.500
Thank you for your testimony.

1597
02:57:13.500 --> 02:57:16.000
I don't see any questions.

1598
02:57:16.000 --> 02:57:19.000
Oh, it's a representative of Gerhard.

1599
02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:21.000
Thank you, Madam Chair.

1600
02:57:21.000 --> 02:57:24.000
Just a quick question for you.

1601
02:57:24.000 --> 02:57:33.000
What is the difference in pay we're talking about here for the people that were pre-11 and post-?

1602
02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:35.000
What do you mean?

1603
02:57:35.000 --> 02:57:37.000
Like percentage maybe?

1604
02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:39.500
Yeah, like what's the total?

1605
02:57:39.500 --> 02:57:41.500
It's a significant number.

1606
02:57:41.500 --> 02:57:44.500
It would be different for everybody.

1607
02:57:44.500 --> 02:57:50.000
I wouldn't have those numbers off the top of my head.

1608
02:57:50.000 --> 02:57:52.000
I had no idea.

1609
02:57:52.000 --> 02:58:10.000
If you're a representative Gerhard, it would, if you're getting a factor of two instead of two and a half, you're getting 80% of the pension for the same years worked in the same final set.

1610
02:58:10.000 --> 02:58:12.000
20% reduction.

1611
02:58:12.000 --> 02:58:15.500
You mean if you went somewhere else?

1612
02:58:15.500 --> 02:58:17.500
No, no, no.

1613
02:58:17.500 --> 02:58:26.500
Just the difference in between you saying the guy next to you, the head, was vested and wasn't.

1614
02:58:26.500 --> 02:58:30.000
I don't know what the numbers are.

1615
02:58:30.000 --> 02:58:37.000
He could have 20% more than you would do for the same final pay.

1616
02:58:37.000 --> 03:00:04.500
Oh, that wasn't i'm just i don't know what the numbers are you could have 20 more than you 20 for the same final pay oh yeah that wasn't me said that but yeah i guess so yeah okay i just didn't know what the number thank you if it was a dollar you don't think i'd be upset right but it's it's it's not a dollar you know i mean it's a significant number but like i said a ton of us came in here under one thing why why would i come here you know what i mean so and and talking to people and trying to recruit people here it's a big word of mouth thing i've had plenty of guys looking to come up here that saves this state or any agency a ton of money you know they can go to an abbreviated academy get somebody with a lot of time on that's all trained up has all these certificates that we'd pay thousands for that we don't have to.

1617
03:00:04.500 --> 03:00:09.500
And they're like, well, I'm not going to go there.

1618
03:00:09.500 --> 03:00:11.500
That makes no sense.

1619
03:00:11.500 --> 03:00:17.000
And you're losing the guy who does have all that experience.

1620
03:00:17.000 --> 03:00:19.000
He's leaving early, right?

1621
03:00:19.000 --> 03:00:24.500
You know, like these are people I would have stuck around.

1622
03:00:24.500 --> 03:00:29.000
I mean, you're throwing money, you're flushing it away.

1623
03:00:29.000 --> 03:00:32.500
Like you're saving it in these calculations.

1624
03:00:32.500 --> 03:00:34.500
I get it.

1625
03:00:34.500 --> 03:00:36.500
At the end, right?

1626
03:00:36.500 --> 03:00:38.500
Like, we've already heard.

1627
03:00:38.500 --> 03:00:43.000
But how much are we losing thousands before that?

1628
03:00:43.000 --> 03:00:45.000
Right?

1629
03:00:45.000 --> 03:00:51.500
The guy with 9, 10 years on is like, he looks at it.

1630
03:00:51.500 --> 03:00:55.500
Well, I got hired when I was 21.

1631
03:00:55.500 --> 03:01:01.000
Now that I'm 30, it's just not worth it to stay.

1632
03:01:01.000 --> 03:01:04.500
And they're going to the private sector.

1633
03:01:04.500 --> 03:01:09.000
Like I said, I don't ever remember that happening.

1634
03:01:09.000 --> 03:01:12.500
I've been a cop for 23 years.

1635
03:01:12.500 --> 03:01:19.000
I've never heard of him before the last, like, five or six years.

1636
03:01:19.000 --> 03:01:22.000
I see it happening a lot.

1637
03:01:22.000 --> 03:01:25.500
It's just not something that ever happened.

1638
03:01:25.500 --> 03:01:32.500
And I think it's a tragedy to let it, when it can be corrected.

1639
03:01:32.500 --> 03:01:34.500
Thank you.

1640
03:01:34.500 --> 03:01:36.500
Representative Shewitt.

1641
03:01:36.500 --> 03:01:38.500
Thank you, Madam Chair.

1642
03:01:38.500 --> 03:01:43.000
Just, I think I understood correctly what you said.

1643
03:01:43.000 --> 03:01:50.500
You were working for NYPD and you were speaking with other officers from different states.

1644
03:01:50.500 --> 03:01:59.000
And what you heard about New Hampshire is what enticed you to come here and seek employment.

1645
03:01:59.000 --> 03:02:01.000
Is that true?

1646
03:02:01.000 --> 03:02:03.000
Yes.

1647
03:02:03.000 --> 03:02:05.000
At the time.

1648
03:02:05.000 --> 03:02:54.000
now it's having the opposite effect it it looks attractive until they start talking to us and then like well that's too much of a gamble why why bother yeah thank you very much for your testimony thank you very much does anyone else wish to testify on house bill 579 yes please good afternoon madam chair committee members thank you for your time please introduce yourself yes ma'am uh gary burke i work at the department of corrections state president concord i'm a captain there i'm also the vice president or acting vice acting of our union.

1649
03:02:54.000 --> 03:02:59.000
I was listening to a lot of the bills today.

1650
03:02:59.000 --> 03:03:06.500
I'm hoping that you will take the time and to consider some type of change.

1651
03:03:06.500 --> 03:03:09.500
I started in 10-1 of 04.

1652
03:03:09.500 --> 03:03:20.000
I did know Officer LeVassar, Manchester PD, who's friends with one of my friends, Michael Valle, who's still at Manchester PD.

1653
03:03:20.000 --> 03:03:23.000
We started here with a contract.

1654
03:03:23.000 --> 03:03:27.000
We went in, we had a hiring process.

1655
03:03:27.000 --> 03:03:31.500
We signed, they told us what our benefits were.

1656
03:03:31.500 --> 03:03:35.000
We would see that sheet every year.

1657
03:03:35.000 --> 03:03:38.000
This has created a massive problem.

1658
03:03:38.000 --> 03:03:46.500
It has created a trust issue between the employees and the state of who we work for.

1659
03:03:46.500 --> 03:03:51.000
People don't believe that the benefits will be restored.

1660
03:03:51.000 --> 03:04:09.500
I was also affected by the layoffs at the facility in 2008 in Laconia, which also definitely hurt the Department of Corrections because we were unable to pull from the counties or the municipalities to come there.

1661
03:04:09.500 --> 03:04:13.500
There's been a steady erosion of benefits since.

1662
03:04:13.500 --> 03:04:29.500
The overtime that we have to do due to the lack of staffing there, minimum, most staff would average about 24 hours of overtime a week at the Department of Corrections currently.

1663
03:04:29.500 --> 03:05:06.500
So when I do 22 years, because under this, it put me to a tiered system at an average of just 20 hours a week, I would have to do 33, I'll have 33 years of service when I go in an environment that is not suited for most individuals with what we deal with on a day from riots, disturbances, several individuals with mental health issues there, placing people in proactive restraint chairs.

1664
03:05:06.500 --> 03:05:21.000
I'll wind up with 22 years of service as it stays now, but I'll actually have 36.5 years when you count the overtime hours that I have to do.

1665
03:05:21.000 --> 03:05:32.500
I had a contract with the state and I would just ask that the state honors that contract with everybody else, including myself.

1666
03:05:32.500 --> 03:05:34.500
Recruitment and retention's hurt.

1667
03:05:34.500 --> 03:05:41.500
We just lost five supervisors last year with 120 years total of state service.

1668
03:05:41.500 --> 03:05:45.000
We did replace those people, people promoted.

1669
03:05:45.000 --> 03:05:53.000
That total years of service for those people that replace them is 13 years of service.

1670
03:05:53.000 --> 03:06:17.500
So if you could think about that at any of the jobs you've had, when you take those years and you replace them with somebody new, the years, the experiences, what they've seen, and the potential for the issues that that can cause in the work environment is great.

1671
03:06:17.500 --> 03:06:38.500
I know that people have said that we had a minimum 20% reduction of pay for the benefits, madam, that you just said, but also the other thing too is in the system, it's also an increase of years as well, right?

1672
03:06:38.500 --> 03:06:42.000
I went from 20 years to 22.

1673
03:06:42.000 --> 03:07:00.500
So when you look at what we do in group two, it doesn't matter if you're in firefighting, if you're in police, if you're in corrections, you look at, it's also about weighing the quality of life.

1674
03:07:00.500 --> 03:07:10.000
So the idea of coming here, when I started, my father worked for the federal government for 41 years.

1675
03:07:10.000 --> 03:07:17.500
So I think I was kind of born or indoctrinated to be a career guy.

1676
03:07:17.500 --> 03:07:21.000
So what enticed me was the benefits.

1677
03:07:21.000 --> 03:07:32.500
You give 20 years of state service, you work hard, and there was a defined pension that you would get when you left.

1678
03:07:32.500 --> 03:07:40.500
After being there for, you know, seven years, they just said, sorry, well, that went away.

1679
03:07:40.500 --> 03:07:44.000
And it's also the quality of life.

1680
03:07:44.000 --> 03:07:56.000
I think one thing that people haven't mentioned is not only does it affect me, but it affects my family, it affects my children.

1681
03:07:56.000 --> 03:08:19.000
Because when you work in these jobs, you answer that bell 24 seven, you represent where you work, we get forced, which basically means I don't have the opportunity to sign up, I may have plans at home, and I'm told that I have to stay.

1682
03:08:19.000 --> 03:08:24.000
So your family makes that commitment to you as well.

1683
03:08:24.000 --> 03:08:27.000
It's not just you by yourself.

1684
03:08:27.000 --> 03:08:30.000
There is a lot of stress.

1685
03:08:30.000 --> 03:08:38.500
I know a group that I represent, One Voice United, we work with mental health and corrections.

1686
03:08:38.500 --> 03:08:47.000
The average life expectancy of an officer in corrections is 59 years versus 75 for everybody else.

1687
03:08:47.000 --> 03:09:01.000
So I just would like the members here today to consider what we're really giving up in corrections and law enforcement in general when we're doing these jobs.

1688
03:09:01.000 --> 03:09:10.000
I know that there are other bills here today, and I do agree that something should be done.

1689
03:09:10.000 --> 03:09:21.500
And whether it's a combination of what we do, I know that there was another House bill today relative to physical fitness standards.

1690
03:09:21.500 --> 03:09:32.000
And I think it's, you know, that's tough, too, because, again, you're also looking, we're there for 16 hours a day.

1691
03:09:32.000 --> 03:09:34.500
We're ordering out every night.

1692
03:09:34.500 --> 03:09:39.000
It's not exactly easy to plan our life there.

1693
03:09:39.000 --> 03:09:47.000
And again, thank you for your time, but this was just a contract that we had.

1694
03:09:47.000 --> 03:10:53.500
And I would just like to state to honor their word because I've honored my word for the last 18 and a half years as a state employee, moving through the ranks, promoting people, recruiting people, people trying to retain it's a hard sell to what we have right now to try to pull people in and try to convince people to stay because there isn't any trust so as soon as people can pull the plug they do because they're worried that maybe the state will come out and tell them that you have more years of service to do or there's even a greater reduction of benefits so please help us out and consider one of these bills to push forward i'll take any questions and thank you for your time.

1695
03:10:53.500 --> 03:10:56.000
Thank you for your testimony.

1696
03:10:56.000 --> 03:10:58.000
Questions?

1697
03:10:58.000 --> 03:11:00.000
Okay.

1698
03:11:00.000 --> 03:11:02.000
Yes.

1699
03:11:02.000 --> 03:11:04.000
Representative Garrett.

1700
03:11:04.000 --> 03:11:06.000
Thank you, Madam Chair.

1701
03:11:06.000 --> 03:11:10.500
I hear a contract being thrown around multiple times.

1702
03:11:10.500 --> 03:11:14.000
So a contract is a legal document.

1703
03:11:14.000 --> 03:11:17.500
Has this been brought through the courts?

1704
03:11:17.500 --> 03:11:19.500
I don't know.

1705
03:11:19.500 --> 03:11:21.500
I'm just curious.

1706
03:11:21.500 --> 03:11:23.500
No, it has not.

1707
03:11:23.500 --> 03:11:27.500
It has not been brought through the courts.

1708
03:11:27.500 --> 03:11:29.500
Okay.

1709
03:11:29.500 --> 03:13:16.500
okay do you have any plan can i follow up i i'm not sure he was the best person to ask but you can ask well i mean you're a member of a major organization uh president acting president have you guys have plans to bring said contract up for discussion in judiciary so years ago sir we were told that this was brought up and we tried to change that and that the court system had ruled that this was not a actual contract um so so it was it was unsuccessful that was kind of the first thing to do is to say hey look we signed this we signed our hiring papers we went through training went through orientation let's honor this but the thought process from other people was that that was not the case so we were not successful okay questions thank you for your testimony and for your service does anyone else wish to testify on house bill 579 okay seeing none i will close the public hearing and without objection go into executive session representative Grota I do I have a motion of ITL for House Bill 540 579 is there a second okay I'll second it again and you wish to speak to your motion do.

1710
03:13:16.500 --> 03:13:25.000
And I don't want anyone in this room to think that I don't support what you're saying.

1711
03:13:25.000 --> 03:13:27.500
I'm not sympathetic to it.

1712
03:13:27.500 --> 03:13:32.500
And I'm deeply touched by the things that I've heard.

1713
03:13:32.500 --> 03:14:02.000
I've been on this committee for my third term, and this is something that's come up every single time and the thing that concerns me the most is the loss of trust that is a significant thing to me because it takes so long to build trust and it takes so long to rebuild it after you've lost it.

1714
03:14:02.000 --> 03:14:13.500
I also want you to know that the subcommittee is open to the public so that we have two bills to work with.

1715
03:14:13.500 --> 03:14:23.500
We have House Bill 436 and House Bill 449, which is why I don't think we need this other bill.

1716
03:14:23.500 --> 03:14:34.500
So I encourage you to come to those subcommittee meetings because they are public and make sure that your voice is heard.

1717
03:14:34.500 --> 03:14:36.500
I will be there.

1718
03:14:36.500 --> 03:14:41.500
I'm not on the subcommittee, but I will be there.

1719
03:14:41.500 --> 03:14:57.500
So because this bill is similar to the other bills, and I think that we can incorporate these concepts in another bill if we so choose, I make this motion of ITL.

1720
03:14:57.500 --> 03:15:01.000
I hope the committee will support me.

1721
03:15:01.000 --> 03:15:07.500
Yes, and I second it for the same reason as House Bill 525.

1722
03:15:07.500 --> 03:15:09.500
They're too similar.

1723
03:15:09.500 --> 03:15:22.000
They all address the same problem in very much the same way, and we'll have to consider which of these concepts we'll go forward with.

1724
03:15:22.000 --> 03:15:25.500
Any other comments, questions from the committee?

1725
03:15:25.500 --> 03:15:27.500
All right.

1726
03:15:27.500 --> 03:15:37.000
Seeing none, the motion is inexpedient to legislate on House Bill 579, and the clerk can call the roll.

1727
03:15:37.000 --> 03:15:39.000
Representative Bailey.

1728
03:15:39.000 --> 03:15:41.000
Yes.

1729
03:15:41.000 --> 03:15:43.000
Representative True.

1730
03:15:43.000 --> 03:15:45.000
Yes.

1731
03:15:45.000 --> 03:15:47.000
Representative Dolan.

1732
03:15:47.000 --> 03:15:49.000
Yes.

1733
03:15:49.000 --> 03:15:51.000
Representative Hebert.

1734
03:15:51.000 --> 03:15:53.000
Yes.

1735
03:15:53.000 --> 03:15:55.000
Representative Gerhard.

1736
03:15:55.000 --> 03:15:57.000
Yes.

1737
03:15:57.000 --> 03:16:07.000
The clerk votes yes representative grotta yes representative schuitt yes representative wilhelm yes representative davis yes representative fitzpatrick yes Yes.

1738
03:16:07.000 --> 03:16:09.000
And the chair?

1739
03:16:09.000 --> 03:16:11.000
Yes.

1740
03:16:11.000 --> 03:16:14.000
We have a vote 12-A, 0-Nay.

1741
03:16:14.000 --> 03:16:16.000
All right.

1742
03:16:16.000 --> 03:16:18.000
Is there any objection?

1743
03:16:18.000 --> 03:16:22.000
At a vote of 12-0, the motion passes.

1744
03:16:22.000 --> 03:16:25.000
Is there any objection to consent?

1745
03:16:25.000 --> 03:16:27.000
All right.

1746
03:16:27.000 --> 03:16:30.500
Seeing none, we'll put this on consent.

1747
03:16:30.500 --> 03:16:33.000
And at your earliest convenience.

1748
03:16:33.000 --> 03:17:45.000
