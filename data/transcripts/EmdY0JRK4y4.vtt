Okay.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,500
Why don't we start in on 645?

13
00:00:25,500 --> 00:01:25,500
Unfortunately, there are more copies coming, but we're going to be working on what we had last week two weeks ago excuse me um and uh where we were at and is there any uh you know at that time we just felt that everybody wanted to have more time to absorb it and understand it and and get comfortable with it so i just want to make sure there is anybody has any other feelings or questions uh about it or are we ready to take action on it this is just a subcommittee right yeah so we don't do we have the do we have the amendment number No, we had this is we this was handed out.

14
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,500
Yeah, but 3 weeks ago or 2327 20.

15
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,500
2327.

16
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,500
2327.

17
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,500
Okay.

18
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,500
Okay.

19
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,500
Okay.

20
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:43,500
Carrie, do you want to talk about it?

21
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,500
No.

22
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,500
Yeah, we're doing 645 right now.

23
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,500
The Dow.

24
00:01:50,500 --> 00:02:21,500
i think we should both be here okay can i make a comment yes keith i just want to make one comment to one way to think about this and i think representative spear you said this uh two weeks ago that these dowels are happening anyway, and this would â€“ this isn't to allow a DAO to happen or not happen.

25
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:31,500
This is to, if they register with the state, to give them similar protections as limited liability as an LLC.

26
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,000
It also protects the state.

27
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,500
It also protects the state.

28
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,500
And that's important to the rest of us.

29
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,500
Exactly.

30
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,500
Right.

31
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,500
So this isn't to allow them.

32
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,500
This is to have them register.

33
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,500
That's some guardrails.

34
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,500
Okay.

35
00:02:54,500 --> 00:03:01,500
So Representative Ammons, seconded by Representative Spears, moves ought to pass on the amendment.

36
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,000
Any discussion on the amendment?

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Seeing in the no we have the business committee do i have each committee here okay the business and cole taxton mclears here no he hit a deer they are so unbelievable how much we have this year.

38
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
We got enough here.

39
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
We got enough.

40
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,500
Right, because we got Ammon, Cole, Hunt, and Herbert, and Spear.

41
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:58,500
And you can replace it it as the minority you can replace uh people actually know if you live in the accident crossed each other out but no with maculaire you can you'll replace macula for today for for now yeah okay all those in favor uh say yes uh yeah right.

42
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,500
All those opposed.

43
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:06,000
So that's one, two, three, four, five, and then to one.

44
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
What do you mean who the one is?

45
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And he's on it.

46
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
He's on it.

47
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
No.

48
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,500
One, two, three, four, five, two, one.

49
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,500
And then we still have the exact one.

50
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,500
Right.

51
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,500
Okay.

52
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,500
You couldn't vote on this, John.

53
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,000
You're not on this committee.

54
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I crossed him and Jackson and Sean out.

55
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
So I like pairing.

56
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:51,500
I don't like this replacement never have okay so that's 10 o'clock so the next one is 20 25 27 2327 23, 27, 23, 27.

57
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,500

Okay.

95
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:47,500
Senate bill 82 is the 1st 1 I have here okay okay uh prompt payment for managed care and uh so i i have to admit i was very impressed with the department's presentation on the prompt payment issue um i will say that i did get an email from the commissioner on that if he really wanted us to get deeper into this thing, we could mandate that every step of the way that there would be notification.

96
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:57,500
and all I could think is cha-ching, cha-ching the cost of having the insurance companies have their software be notified.

97
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:40,500
all i could think is uh to ching to change the cost of of having a uh the insurance companies have their software be notifying the department for every step of the way and terming in terms of timing um so i i didn't go think too much more about that amendment but so um otherwise do we have any other comments anybody else have any comments this is the prompt pay and issue yeah yeah Okay, so I have Representative Terry making well to it.

98
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,000

House Bill 279.

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Okay.

175
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,500
And we have the latest, greatest amendment that's been passed around.

176
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:29,500
And because even after the last one where we changed it, it turns out we had another little technical correction.

177
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:33,000
Am I looking at the right bill?

178
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,500
That ain't the right bill.

179
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,500

Alright, so we're now adjourned until our session, which is scheduled 1 1.30?

208
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,500
Did I do it that late?

209
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:28,000
Oh, I guess I was worried about people wanting wanting people to talk.

210
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,500
Um Yeah, I I, I.

211
00:14:30,500 --> 00:15:15,500
that that was i got an email from uh the house clerk saying that the calendar was going to close early and my fear was in case we didn't get something done that we would need next week so I wanted to get in in the calendar so so that that just leaves that possibility that you know if if we can't resolve it today then we have next week but but we I I was it's purely a backup you know it's Hopefully we'll never get to that place.

212
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:20,500
All right, so I'll see you all at 1.30 then.

213
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:34,500
Okay, and I'm still looking for volunteers for anything that somebody wants to make a motion on, so I don't have to make motion like the marijuana ones.

214
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:40,500
There must be some other people who want to make that motion.

215
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,500
Interim study of the last two.

216
00:15:43,500 --> 00:16:49,000
either one to pick one right now if you look at the sheet you see my name is there way too much so i was willing to do it because honestly i'm on the commission but so is representative sullivan so maybe he would like to make the motion sure we need to keep it around to study it yeah we're just we're keeping around as vehicles all right of the two of them it said the house bill and then the senate bill okay all right how about condos do we have any don't anybody any democrats who have condos yeah there's one about there's one about the lanes yeah i think that should be okay all right so so you'll make them yeah this yeah that should be killed.

217
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Okay.

218
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
All right.

219
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
So you'll make the â€“ yeah.

220
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
This â€“ yeah.

221
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
That's 178.

222
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Yeah, 178.

223
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
And you're going to take that.

224
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

225
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Yeah, they're okay.

226
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
No, no, we're in an interim study now.

227
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:32,500
And I really do believe the interim study is the right issue because to put it into a chapter study committee, which we hope senators will show up for in the second year, is no, they don't show up.

228
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:47,500
So this way, we, the committee, and all those ones who, you know, give us an opportunity for everybody to really understand because it's a very, it's a long story.

229
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,500
Right.

230
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,500
Okay.

231
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,500
All right.

232
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,000
So Chris, you'll do 178.

233
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
The condo leans.

234
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000

And so otherwise, we'll get through this, see how fast we can do this, right?

375
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
All right.

376
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
First up is House Bill 73.

377
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
three and...

378
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I'd like to make a motion to move HB 73 relative to the repair of home appliances to interim study.

379
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Interim study.

380
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,500
And second to that motion.

381
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,500
Representative Thackson.

382
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:37,500
and you're recognized to speak to that motion.

383
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:42,500
Representative Jackson and you're recognized to speak to your motion.

384
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,500
Excuse me.

385
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:49,000
It's just not ready at this point in time.

386
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,500
So interim study would be a good way to.

387
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:58,500
Kind of tease out all the issues with that bill.

388
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,500
Okay.

389
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,500
Yeah, Representative Burroughs.

390
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:17,000
Just before we vote, Sean Faleo asked me to say that he felt that we should target manufacturer's practice of canceling warranties if another repair works on the product.

391
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:24,500
That's entirely different legislation and would need a lot of input and research and input.

392
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:36,000
And he said I was the one who fought to save this bill from ITL, but at this point see it as unsavable.

393
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,500
So I just wanted to share that.

394
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,500
Okay.

395
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,500
Okay.

396
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,500
So the motion is interim study.

397
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,500

And we already have government legislation that does not allow that.

And the state government has already issued words to the effect that they're not allowed to do it.

Next up is 225.

00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Relative to the prohibited use of currency that could be detrimental to privacy rights.

696
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
And I believe the subcommittee did interim study.

697
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,500
So who do I have?

698
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,500
Representative Ammon.

699
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,500
Seconded by Representative Burroughs.

700
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,500
Okay.

701
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:56,000
Seconded by Representative Patusek moves interim study and Representative Ammon is recognized to speak to his motion.

702
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Thank you, Mr.

703
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Chair.

704
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:12,000
I believe this bill was attempting to address central bank digital currencies, which is something that at least a few dozen countries are pursuing.

705
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:49,500
I think at this time it's too early to know exactly how to legislate one way or the other but the issue will keep coming back i think there has been another bill filed in the subject area that we'll be dealing with probably on this committee so i recommend interim study to keep it alive and have some future discussion about it other discussion on the motion of interim study for hospital 22 225?

706
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,500
Representative Spear.

707
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,500
Three comments.

708
00:43:53,500 --> 00:44:03,500
The state of Florida has attempted to do this, but in a slightly different fashion, and they passed the bill.

709
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:25,500
And in the, and I have a copy of it here, and in the FN for that bill, it says, if the Federal Reserve ever decides to issue a central bank digital currency that applies to the public, this bill will be considered unconstitutional.

710
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:31,500
We don't know what this central bank digital currency will look like.

711
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:40,500
We're putting in a law on the books for something we have no idea what it looks like.

712
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:47,500
In addition to that, the Federal Reserve has issued a paper describing what's involved.

713
00:44:47,500 --> 00:45:00,000
And in order to issue a public bank, a public version of a bank currency, it would take the place essentially of the local banks.

714
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:06,000
95% of people in this country already have relationships with their banks.

715
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:20,000
And they said, the Federal Reserve said that unless a law is passed, it would cost them hundreds of millions of dollars to issue such a public currency.

716
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:41,000
So the point of what I'm trying to say here is we're putting a law on the books that is both unconstitutional and we don't know what the Federal Reserve even looks like, and we don't know what the law should be.

717
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:50,000
This law does not belong to be â€“ it shouldn't be â€“ Right, but we're not passing anything.

718
00:45:50,000 --> 00:46:08,000
All we're doing is studying it and to see if there is some way that you could do it constitutionally, A, or B, whether this is just not necessary and when we don't need this bill.

719
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I made my comment.

720
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,000
That's what I got to say about it.

721
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Okay.

722
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Do whatever you want.

723
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:32,500
Well, you know what I really want is I want it just to go interim study and we put it on the consent calendar and call it a day.

724
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,500
Okay.

725
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:37,000
That's what I really want.

726
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
I'm so sorry.

727
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,500
Interim study goes on the consent calendar?

728
00:46:42,500 --> 00:47:20,500
if we vote for it but if if you were able to convince a large chunk of people here to go with not passing an interim study motion then we would have to uh have to have it on the regular calendar yeah we don't have to speak on it but it gives us the opportunity to speak yeah i know i just i just no i understand i made my comments that's all i do.

729
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:25,000
So let this thing disappear on the consent calendar.

730
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
There's another bill coming.

731
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Okay.

732
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
All right.

733
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Representative Ammon, you have a comment?

734
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:45,000
I was just going to say there's another bill filed by â€“ so we'll have to talk about this all over again.

735
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,000
That's a good point, what you just said.

736
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,500
So the governor signed an executive order.

737
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:55,000
I've talked about this before.

738
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,500
He created a cryptocurrency digital asset commission.

739
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:01,000
We met for a year.

740
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,500
We had a final report.

741
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:10,500
And in that final report, I put a statement about central bank digital currencies.

742
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:15,000
This is before any of these bills were filed.

743
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:23,000
And it was just to make people aware of it, not necessarily to act on legislation.

744
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,000
But somebody's trying to act on it, right?

745
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,500
Yeah, but we're going to study it.

746
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:32,500
Right.

747
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:38,500
We're're going to keep the issue around, but not act on it.

748
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:42,500
I have the problem with the word detrimental.

749
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:48,000
That's only one of the words you have a problem with.

750
00:48:48,000 --> 00:49:11,500
Just to start, so to me, yeah, but so in terms of really trying to fully understand what the issue here is, that idea that could there actually be a currency in which the government gets to know everything you're doing with that transaction and that currency.

751
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:17,000
Yeah, let me say, every bill has a grain of truth.

752
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:27,500
This has a grain of truth that does sound a little scary to me, that government could track my currency transaction.

753
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:31,000
The purpose of it is to track.

754
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Okay?

755
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:39,000
And I certainly would never want my government to be doing that.

756
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,500
I definitely disagree with you on that.

757
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:44,500
I absolutely disagree.

758
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:46,500
Okay.

759
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:52,500
You think that's a good idea, that government can track your transactions?

760
00:49:52,500 --> 00:50:00,500
I think that, first of all, banks do track every single thing that you do already.

761
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:09,500
But I do not believe that that is the intent of a central bank digital currency at all.

762
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:21,500
And if you go to the Federal Reserve website, words one after the other tell you that is not what they want to do.

763
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:26,000
And they don't want to do this at all.

764
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:36,000
They don't even want to do it because it's going to cost hundreds of millions of dollars to do it.

765
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,000
And they don't want to spend the money.

766
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:45,000
So we're legislating against something that isn't going to happen.

767
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:50,500
And if it ever did, we don't know what it is.

768
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:56,500
And if we outlawed it, it would be against the Constitution anyway.

769
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:59,500
We're far from passing this bill.

770
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:01,500
We're far, far away.

771
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:03,500
All right.

772
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,500
I've said my set.

773
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:07,500
Okay.

774
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:12,000
Any more discussion on the motion of interim study?

775
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Right.

776
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:39,000
See none will call the roll all right ammon yes thank you yes patusick yes terry yes post yes cole yes pocelli yes faxton yes Walsh yes burrows no herbert no clerk no um howard no vincent i wish i could say maybe I can't, so I'll just say yes.

777
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Labro?

778
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Yes.

779
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Gibbs?

780
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
No.

781
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Spear?

782
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:54,000
There are a few of us that want to IDL.

783
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,000
I just want this bill to go away.

784
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Sullivan.

785
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,500
I'm tempted to say yes.

786
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:10,500
You can say what she wants to say, but you do have to make an answer.

787
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,500
Really?

788
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:42,000
You do say yes or no yes you do have to you can't have seen you missed that opportunity walking out of the room i know and i if i wasn't so silly i would have realized what was happening okay so what's the what's the vote believe it or not i'm gonna say yes because i'm'm an idiot.

789
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
All right.

790
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Sullivan.

791
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Yes.

792
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
I'm sorry.

793
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Chairman.

794
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Yes.

795
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
All right.

796
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,500
So you guys don't want to change your votes.

797
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:03,000
You can change your vote.

798
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
14 to 5.

799
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
14 to 5.

800
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:11,000
And we'll leave that on the regular calendar.

801
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Okay.

802
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Yeah.

803
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Would there be a minority report?

804
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Yeah.

805
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Okay.

806
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Okay.

807
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Start up trouble.

808
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
No, that's fine.

809
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
No, that's fine.

810
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
That's fine.

811
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
That's fine.

812
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Okay.

813
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Start up trouble.

814
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
No, that's fine.

815
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
No, that's fine.

816
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
That's fine.

817
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
That's fine.

818
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Okay.

819
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:53,000
House Bill 227 relative to fair access to financial services.

820
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,500
Can we ITL this one?

821
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:58,500
John, you don't like it either.

822
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:00,500
Nobody likes this bill.

823
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:05,500
So ITL moved by Representative Bollier and seconded by Sullivan.

824
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:07,500
ITL.

825
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:10,000
When are you saying ITL?

826
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
I'll second that.

827
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Wait a minute.

828
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:20,500
We were going to have Persella was going to do an interim study.

829
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:23,000
Well, we made the motion.

830
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
You did?

831
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Did I?

832
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:31,000
This COVID thing makes me really deaf sometimes.

833
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Kirk made the motion.

834
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,500
I have my speaker on.

835
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:37,500
Hold on.

836
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:39,500
My mic.

837
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:41,500
Okay.

838
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:45,000
What motion was made and seconded first?

839
00:54:45,000 --> 00:55:36,500
Motion ITL was moved and seconded by Sullivan.ivan was that the motion on the floor then i guess so all right that's fine yes you can all right well first who said made the motion with sullivan myself oh you made the motion this is impressive i'm i'm uh okay all right well we won't let this happen again okay representative bullio is recognized to speak to our motion i never liked esgs i don't like the conversation that's been going on for four years now, and I just refuse to pass any bill recommending that the banks have to follow ESG rules.

840
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:38,500
Chairman Hunt?

841
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:40,500
Chairman Hunt?

842
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:42,500
Yes.

843
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:52,000
Again, could I ask that everybody speak into the microphone rather than turning their heads to address somebody else?

844
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Yes.

845
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Please speak to everybody.

846
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
It's very confusing.

847
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Thank you.

848
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Chairman Hunt?

849
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Yes.

850
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:13,500
Again, could I ask that everybody speak into the microphone rather than turning their heads to address somebody else?

851
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:15,500
Yes.

852
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:17,500
Please speak directly.

853
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:19,500
It's very confusing.

854
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:21,500
I'm sorry.

855
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:23,500
Listen to Representative Salah.

856
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:25,500
Yeah.

857
00:56:25,500 --> 00:57:23,500
No, so this was a â€“ I'm kind of surprised that this is actually as controversial as it is on this committee because I know that many on this committee from the opposing party of mine is are not supportive of this i mean we're basically saying to banks what they can and cannot consider when they're running their business and that just fundamentally goes against everything i believe in it goes in everything that a lot of other people in this committee believe in i think uh they came back with a slight tweak in their amendment but even so it it, it still hamstrings various banks if they want to change their business model.

858
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:27,000
It would be hard to do that.

859
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:45,500
I mean, just why are we in the business, why are we as a legislature in the business of telling banks what they can and cannot consider when they're making a loan or conducting business with people?

860
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:54,500
We already have federal statutes that prevent discrimination and banking against things like race or gender or religion.

861
00:57:54,500 --> 00:58:04,500
But beyond that, I think if you want to have a special niche that focuses on ESG things, that's fine.

862
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:13,500
If you want to have a special niche that focuses on oil and gas drilling companies, that's fine.

863
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:18,000
I don't think we should make laws prohibiting either.

864
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:29,500
And this is a law to prohibit one type of thing that is offensive to certain types of people who have certain worldviews.

865
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:35,000
And I don't think we should take a stance on that.

866
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:48,500
I think we should let the market do its job, which is to let the businesses, the banks, run the businesses how they want to run it.

867
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:56,000
And I think it's kind of crazy that we're trying to get involved in this.

868
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Well said.

869
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Representative Ammon.

870
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Thank you, Mr.

871
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Chair.

872
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:09,500
And I don't disagree with anything the previous speaker just said.

873
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:19,500
The history of this bill last term, the Senate turned it into a study commission that was supposed to happen.

874
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:30,500
And what they did was they said the first named Senate member calls the first meeting and they never called the meeting.

875
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:34,500
So they never actually had the study commission.

876
00:59:34,500 --> 01:00:08,000
So that's why I would be in favor of an alternate motion of interim study, just so that the subject matter is given its due, the market operates best with the most information, and maybe we could figure out exactly what's happening here, you know, in the meantime, and that information could inform the market to, you know, to be more, you know, to operate more optimally.

877
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,500
So that would be my alternate motion.

878
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:21,500
Okay, so the reason why I wanted to interim study it is that this is an issue that is ongoing.

879
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:26,000
It's being talked about by a lot of states.

880
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:39,500
And I like the opportunity for us to always keep the option open where we can keep a bill around that some of us find is controversial.

881
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:48,500
Some of us say it would be a cold day in hell that we'd ever vote for it.

882
01:00:48,500 --> 01:01:00,500
But at the same time, we want to make sure we understand the issue, understand what the people who are concerned about the issue.

883
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:08,000
And so that we have an opportunity to place where we can have that conversation.

884
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:15,500
And Lord knows there's some other bills on this that have the same situation, guys.

885
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:17,500
Okay.

886
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:21,000
And that's why it was interim study.

887
01:01:21,000 --> 01:02:07,500
It said we're just, you know, I understand, you know, that you can't really get behind its piece of truth to it, but the fact is that there have been stories where people have accused of financial institutions not giving a loan simply because of the nature of the business and and so if that is true then we should at least be looking into it no the bank is supposed to tell you why they're opposed to it so I the pending motion is ITL and the clerk will call the roll.

888
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:09,500
Ammon.

889

And second by Representative Patusek.

980
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:27,500
So, the intent of this bill by the sponsor was to require all condos to have to get to audited financials.

981
01:06:27,500 --> 01:07:21,500
And requiring audited financials is a very expensive tool, as some of you might know if you've been in business you know that getting a full full audit is a huge cost and um obviously there was no uh change the size of the condo or really need the condo or and you know you're basically you want to force the condo have to do it even though they don't see that they have a financial problem so at this point I think this bill should be inexpedient to legislate and who motioned I made the motion and representative Ptussek second Is there any discussion on the motion?

01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:18,500
18 to 1.

1253
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:20,500
18 to 1.

1254
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:27,000
Representative Gibbs, would you vote okay with putting this on the consent calendar?

1255
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
Yes.

1256
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Okay.

1257
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:35,500
All those in favor and consent, please say aye.

1258
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:37,500
Aye.

1259
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:39,500
Those opposed?

1260
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:41,500
Okay.

1261
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:43,500
All right.

1262
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:48,000
House Bill 373, relative to billing for ambulance services.

1263
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
No, you skipped one.

1264
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
353.

1265
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
353.

1266
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
Oh, okay.

1267
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
Sorry.

1268
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:01,000
Oh, I see what I did.

1269
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,500
I see what I did.

1270
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:05,500
Okay.

1271
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:10,000
353, establish an interstate compact for universal health care.

1272
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:14,500
And Representative McGill, you're going to take this one.

1273
01:26:14,500 --> 01:26:16,500
Thank you, Mr.

1274
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:18,500
Chairman.

1275
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:23,500
I'd like to move an expedient to legislate on 353.

1276
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:25,500
Okay.

1277
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:29,500
And you're recognized to speak to your motion.

1278
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:35,000
Seconded by Representative Patuzek, you're recognized to speak to your motion.

1279
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
Thank you, Mr.

1280
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
Chairman.

1281
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:48,000
This bill would have created a single-payer system in the form of a interstate compact in New Hampshire.

1282
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:53,500
I see no viable source of funding in the bill either.

1283
01:26:53,500 --> 01:27:42,000
Certainly needs a little more work and it's probably not the right time for this bill the the bill also relies on neighboring states creating similar interstate compacts with the intent that we would join those and join a national single-payer health care system so for those reasons i urge you to vote itl okay any other discussion on the motion of inexpedient to legislate seeing none the clerk will call the roll ammon yes thank you yes patoosic yes terry yes post yes cole yes bachelli yes faxton yes walsh yes burrows yes herbert yes Yes.

1284
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Cole.

1285
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
Yes.

1286
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
Coachelli.

1287
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
Yes.

1288
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
Baxton.

1289
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
Yes.

1290
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Walsh.

1291
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
Yes.

1292
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Burrows.

1293
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Yes.

1294
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Herbert.

1295
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Yes.

1296
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
Burke.

1297
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
Yes.

1298
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Howard.

1299
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
Yes.

1300
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
Vincent.

1301
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Yes.

1302
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Labro.

1303
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
Yes.

1304
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Gibbs.

1305
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
Spear.

1306
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Yes.

1307
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
Sullivan.

1308
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
Yes.

1309
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Chairman Hunt.

1310
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
Yes.

1311
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
18 to 1.

1312
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
Okay.

1313
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:46,500
All those in favor of placing on the consent calendar, please say aye.

1314
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:48,500
Aye.

1315
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:50,500
Those opposed?

1316
01:28:50,500 --> 01:28:52,500
So moved.

1317
01:28:52,500 --> 01:28:54,500
Okay.

1318
01:28:54,500 --> 01:28:59,000
House Bill 373 relative to billing for ambulance services.

1319
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:03,000
I'd like to make a motion to ITL.

1320
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
Okay.

1321
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
Okay.

1322
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:11,500
House Bill 373 relative to billing for ambulance services.

1323
01:29:11,500 --> 01:29:15,500
I'd like to make a motion to ITL.

1324
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:17,500
Okay.

1325
01:29:17,500 --> 01:29:23,000
Representative Burroughs, seconded by Representative Patusek, moves in expedient to legislate.

1326
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:28,000
And Representative Burroughs is recognized to speak to our motion.

1327
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
Yes.

1328
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:41,500
This bill has been rendered unnecessary because there's been a committee formed by the insurance commissioner with the stakeholders involved in this issue.

1329
01:29:41,500 --> 01:29:53,000
So that committee and the commissioner feel that this is not a legislative issue, and I feel this bill is no longer necessary.

1330
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
Okay.

1331
01:29:55,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Any more discussion on the motion of inexperience to legislate?

1332
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:13,500

Herbert.

1335
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:19,500
Yes.

1336
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:21,500
Clark.

1337
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:23,500
Yes.

1338
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:25,500
Howard.

1339
01:30:25,500 --> 01:30:27,500
Yes.

1340
01:30:27,500 --> 01:30:29,500
Vincent.

1341
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:31,500
Yes.

1342
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:33,500
Blabrow.

1343
01:30:33,500 --> 01:30:35,500
Yes.

1344
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:37,500
Gibbs.

1345
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:39,500
Yes.

1346
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:41,500
Spear.

1347
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:43,500
Yes.

1348
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:45,500
Sullivan.

1349
01:30:45,500 --> 01:30:47,500
Yes.

1350
01:30:47,500 --> 01:30:49,500
And Chairman Hunt.

1351
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:51,500
Yes.

1352
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:53,500
19 to 0.

1353
01:30:53,500 --> 01:31:00,500
All those in favor of placing it on the consent calendar, please say aye.

1354
01:31:00,500 --> 01:31:02,500
Aye.

1355
01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:05,500
Those opposed, so move to Hamsley.

1356
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:07,500
Okay.

1357
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:12,500
383, relative to provider contract standards for pharmacy benefit managers.

1358
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:17,000
Representative Patusek, seconded by Representative Burroughs, moves to legislate.

1359
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Thank you, Mr.

1360
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
Speaker.

1361
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
Mr.

1362
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
Chairman.

1363
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:31,500
I move ITL on HB 383 relative to provide contract standards for PBMs.

1364
01:31:31,500 --> 01:31:42,500
A very complex subject and it's just another law that we don't really need okay it's a little bit more than that.

1365
01:31:42,500 --> 01:31:55,000
But anyways, this was the issue that the pharmacies wanted to know if they, why can't they, you know, where can they get it cheaper?

1366
01:31:55,000 --> 01:32:04,000
And so that they were not being shortchanged on how much it would cost them to buy drugs.

1367
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:11,500
And clearly the PBMs are able to buy it cheaper than the independent pharmacists can.

1368
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:23,000
I just want to add that I think some of the larger pharmaceutical companies are going bankrupt because of this issue, the PBMs.

1369
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
Yeah.

1370
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:30,500
I don't know that Rite Aid is going because of PBMs.

1371
01:32:30,500 --> 01:32:40,500
I think Rite Aid is going bankrupt because they took out huge loans that they couldn't get too many locations.

1372
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:43,500
And their debt service was overwhelming.

1373
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:46,000
Well, there are some pharmacies.

1374
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:50,500
But, okay, that is your entitled to your opinion.

1375
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:52,500
Right.

1376
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:54,500
Representative Spear.

1377
01:32:54,500 --> 01:33:07,500
I did a lot of research on this one to find out what states had this law, and there were a bunch of states that do.

1378
01:33:07,500 --> 01:33:12,000
But this law by itself doesn't do the answer.

1379
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:26,000
It needs to have a bunch of other things that go with it, and we could go through that someday, but this law by itself won't do it.

1380
01:33:26,000 --> 01:34:06,000
So that's why I think we need to really ITL it, and if somebody wants to do something in the future that it needs to be more comprehensive if we want this to work okay all right so the motion is in the experience to legislate oh thank you okay clerk will call the roll all right amin yes mcqueue yes patoosic oh yes terry yes post yes cole yes picelli yes faxton yes walsh yes burrows yes herbert Yes.

1381
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
Herbert.

1382
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
Yes.

1383
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Yes.

1384
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
Howard.

1385
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
Yes.

1386
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Vincent.

1387
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Yes.

1388
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
Yes.

1389
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
Gibbs.

1390
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
Yes.

1391
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
Yes.

1392
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
Sullivan.

1393
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
Yes.

1394
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
Chairman.

1395
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
Yes.

1396
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
19 to 0.

1397
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
Okay.

1398
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:46,500
All those in favor of placing on the consent calendar, please say aye.

1399
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:48,500
Aye.

1400
01:34:48,500 --> 01:34:51,000
Those opposed, so move unanimously.

1401
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
Okay.

1402
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
All right.

1403
01:34:55,000 --> 01:35:01,000
House Bill 414, relative to health insurance coverage for preventative PFAS care?

1404
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:15,500
I make motion to I move the motion of ITL as we do not need this bill because we have two other bills coming which will be more comprehensive.

1405
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:23,500
Well that's the other PFAS bills, but yes, this one, sorry, I gave you bad advice.

1406
01:35:23,500 --> 01:35:25,500
Okay.

1407
01:35:25,500 --> 01:35:33,000
Yeah, so 414 is, this was the insurance companies who are already providing the services.

1408
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:39,500
Sorry, you asked me about it, and I gave you the wrong answer.

1409
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:41,500
That's my fault.

1410
01:35:41,500 --> 01:35:43,500
Yes, Representative Speer.

1411
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:58,000
The bill was based on a 300-page study that was submitted to the CDC, and the idea was the hope that that would have been adopted by the CDC.

1412
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:12,500
Since the CDC did not adopt it, we can't make the insurance companies adopt something that wasn't approved by the CDC, and that's why we don't want the bill.

1413
01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:14,500
All said.

1414
01:36:14,500 --> 01:36:16,500
Thank you.

1415
01:36:16,500 --> 01:36:20,000
At least somebody does their homework here.

1416
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
Yeah.

1417
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:25,000
Hey, I read my car manuals.

1418
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
Okay.

1419
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
Okay.

1420
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
All right.

1421
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:34,500
So the motion is inexperienced to legislate.

1422
01:36:34,500 --> 01:36:37,500
Any more discussion on the motion?

1423
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:54,000
Seeing see none the clerk will call the roll all right and this is ITO on 4 414 all right Ammon yes McHugh yes Tusek yes Terry yes post yes Cole yes Pacelli.

1424
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
Yes.

1425
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
McHugh.

1426
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
Yes.

1427

Yes.

1447
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
Howard.

1448
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
Yes.

1449
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
Vincent.

1450
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
Yes.

1451
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000

Yes.

1455
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
Spear.

1456
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
Yes.

1457
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
Sullivan.

1458
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
Yes.

1459
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
Chairman Hunt.

1460
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
Yes.

1461
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
19 to 0.

1462
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
Okay.

1463
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:16,500
All those in favor for consent, please say aye.

1464
01:38:16,500 --> 01:38:18,500
Aye.

1465
01:38:18,500 --> 01:38:21,000
Those opposed, so moved unanimously.

1466
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
Okay.

1467
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:30,000
Okay, next up is 465, restricting Use of PFAS Substances in Certain Consumer Products.

1468
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
Representative Spear.

1469
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
Right.

1470
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:50,500
The motion is to interim study this because, and for the same reason as HB 242, we have another bill that's coming along in the next session that will codify both bills together.

1471
01:38:50,500 --> 01:38:54,500
And so this bill isn't really needed anymore.

1472
01:38:54,500 --> 01:38:56,500
Okay.

1473
01:38:56,500 --> 01:39:00,500
Any more discussion on the interim study motion?

1474
01:39:00,500 --> 01:39:02,500
Who seconded it?

1475
01:39:02,500 --> 01:39:04,500

1500
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:51,500
Representative McGue, moves interim study, seconded by Representative Hunt.

1501
01:43:51,500 --> 01:43:56,000
Representative McGue, you'll recognize to speak to your motion.

1502
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
Thank you, Mr.

1503
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
Chairman.

1504
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:04,000
I was the prime sponsor on this bill.

1505
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:07,500
There was a great deal of confusion.

1506
01:44:07,500 --> 01:44:12,000
It started out addressing white bagging and brown bagging.

1507
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:20,000
The conversation evolved into discussing methods of billing for pharmacy, for pharmaceuticals under medical versus pharmacy.

1508
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:23,500
Need some more time to work on.

1509
01:44:23,500 --> 01:44:30,000
I'll be happy to work on it, and I'd appreciate the interim study.

1510
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
Okay.

1511
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:35,000
Any more discussion on the motion?

1512
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:39,000
Seeing none, the clerk will call the roll.

1513
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
Interim study.

1514
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
Ammon.

1515
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
Yes.

1516
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
McHugh.

1517
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
Yes.

1518
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
Patusick.

1519
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
Yes.

1520
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
Terry.

1521
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
Coase.

1522
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
Yes.

1523
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
Cole.

1524
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
Yes.

1525
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
Procelli.

1526
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
Yes.

1527
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:14,500
Max those in favor of placing the bill on the consent calendar, please say aye.

1528
01:45:14,500 --> 01:45:16,500
Aye.

1529
01:45:16,500 --> 01:45:19,000
Those opposed, so move unanimously.

1530
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:23,000
House Bill 544, legalizing cannabis for retail sale.

1531
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:27,500
I'd like to make a motion for interim study.

1532
01:45:27,500 --> 01:45:29,500
Okay.

1533
01:45:29,500 --> 01:45:34,500
Representative Burroughs moves out interim study, seconded by Representative Sullivan.

1534
01:45:34,500 --> 01:45:36,500
Okay.

1535
01:45:36,500 --> 01:45:41,000
Representative Burroughs, you're recognized to speak to your motion.

1536
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
Yeah.

1537
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
There is a commission.

1538
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:56,500
There's a new commission this year that is studying marijuana, and there has been another bill introduced that will be introduced next year.

1539
01:45:56,500 --> 01:46:10,000
But I think it's a good idea to keep the conversation open about cannabis because I believe it's really time that we legalize it in New Hampshire.

1540
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:16,000
We're losing revenue, and we desperately need cannabis gummies in the Statehouse.

1541
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
Oh, my God.

1542
01:46:18,000 --> 01:47:27,500
we're losing revenue and we desperately need cannabis gummies in the in the state house oh my god please don't make me pee in a cup okay oh boy all right all right uh the motion is uh interim interim study on house bell 544 the clerk may call the roll Ammon yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes walsh yes burrows yes herbert yes clerk yes howard yes vincent puff puff yes collabro yes gibbs yes spear yes sullivan yes and chairman hunt yes Gibbs Speer Sullivan Chairman Hunt Yes Okay, motion passes All those in favor Placing on the consent calendar, please say aye Those opposed So move unanimously Okay, last House bill Relative to the establishment of a decentralized autonomous organizations as legal entities within the state.

1543
01:47:27,500 --> 01:47:35,000
And Representative Ammon, seconded by Representative Burroughs, moves to pass on the amendment number 2327.

1544
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:39,500
Representative Ammon is recognized to speak to his motion.

1545
01:47:39,500 --> 01:48:23,500
Thank you, Mr you mr chair so we retained this bill to do further work over the summer and the amendment before us is the result of that it's a replacement of the bill beginning with the language of the original bill but it does a full uh replace after the enacting clause and this is a a product of consulting with the Department of Revenue, the Banking Department, the Secretary of State's office, and other experts to try to resolve some of the questions that came up.

1546
01:48:23,500 --> 01:48:30,000
Representative Filio asked a bunch of really helpful questions in the original testimony.

1547
01:48:30,000 --> 01:49:07,000
And so this is the end result of that so the the internet has allowed us to communicate in in brand new ways and and a a dow based on blockchain technology allows us to organize in brand new ways and that's what a dow allows for and it does so in a transparent way um so this bill would would legally recognize d, and it could attract positive economic activity to our state.

1548
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:28,500
Other states have done something similar, Utah most recently, and it instructs the Secretary of State to implement a registry so that the state would be able to register the activity of these DAOs just like they do with LLCs and other corporations.

1549
01:49:28,500 --> 01:49:32,500
This doesn't allow for DAOs to be created.

1550
01:49:32,500 --> 01:49:34,500
They're already being created.

1551
01:49:34,500 --> 01:49:50,000
This just allows for the DAOs, entices them to register with the state for legal protections, as long as they don't violate any of the rules that are in this amendment.

1552
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:55,000
So I ask for all to pass on the amendment.

1553
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
Great.

1554
01:49:57,000 --> 01:50:02,000
I just want to make a comment on the FN.

1555
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:05,500
Are you, are you fine with that?

1556
01:50:05,500 --> 01:50:08,000
There's a note, financial note.

1557
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:14,000
Yeah, but that, that would have been based on the original bill.

1558
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:18,000
So there's still, there's no FN on it?

1559
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
Who knows?

1560
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:27,500
If you have to pull up the original bill and see what the FN was.

1561
01:50:27,500 --> 01:50:29,500
So there'll be discussions.

1562
01:50:29,500 --> 01:50:33,500
I'm just going to give you a preview.

1563
01:50:33,500 --> 01:50:45,500
If it passes, there'll be discussions in the Senate about tweaking that to make sure that it's covered for the Secretary of State's office.

1564
01:50:45,500 --> 01:50:49,500
Will that be a tax or a fee?

1565
01:50:49,500 --> 01:50:51,500
No, it'll be fee-based.

1566
01:50:51,500 --> 01:50:53,500
It'll be fee-based.

1567
01:50:53,500 --> 01:50:57,000
I thought a fee was a tax.

1568
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
No, no.

1569
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
It's a user fee.

1570
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:05,500
You pay so well good attention on the house.

1571
01:51:05,500 --> 01:51:14,500
So you only pay for it if you're using the service, just like you do with a corporation.

1572
01:51:14,500 --> 01:51:16,500
Wow.

1573
01:51:16,500 --> 01:51:18,500
All right.

1574
01:51:18,500 --> 01:51:21,000
And wouldn't charge you here.

1575
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
Yeah.

1576
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:27,000
So again, this would be optional for DAOs.

1577
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:43,500
If DAOs want to have the protections in this bill, they would sign up for it, but DALs are being created all over the place at this time on the Internet right now.

1578
01:51:43,500 --> 01:51:45,500
Okay.

1579
01:51:45,500 --> 01:51:54,000
Any more discussion on the motion of ought to pass on the amendment to House Bill 645?

1580
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:58,000
Seeing none, the clerk will call the roll.

1581
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
Ammon.

1582
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
Yes.

1583
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
Hugh.

1584
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
Yes.

1585
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
Patusick.

1586
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
Yes.

1587
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
Terry.

1588
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
Yes.

1589
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:18,000
Seeing none, the clerk will call the roll.

1590
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:35,000
Clark no Howard yes Vincent yes yes yes yes yes yes all right 17 to 17 to 2 the motion is now represent Ammonmon, seconded by Representative Burroughs, moved off to pass as amended.

1591
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:38,500

I think this is an issue of a lot of importance to many of our constituents, some of whom are here today.

1658
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:55,500
And I know that there are quite a number of us on the committee that want to seriously study this and look for a solution.

1659
01:55:55,500 --> 01:56:10,000
And I just also, I was asked to tell you that Chris McAleer wanted to be here today, but he hit a deer and he could not be here.

1660
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:14,000
But he really is here to support you.

1666
01:56:35,500 --> 01:56:37,500
Okay.

1684
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,500
I'm just trying to understand.

1685
01:58:17,500 --> 01:58:19,500
Okay.

1686
01:58:19,500 --> 01:58:25,000
I was surprised that it got distributed, but it could have.

1687
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
This is a mistake.

1688
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
Yeah, okay.

1689
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
It was a mistake.

1690
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
Okay.

1691
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:37,500
If we could rewind the tape and omit that.

1692
01:58:37,500 --> 01:58:39,500
Mr.

1693
01:58:39,500 --> 01:58:41,500
Chairman, okay.

1694
01:58:41,500 --> 01:59:02,000
As you may recall, for all of those kids who are home from school now and watching on YouTube, we received a marvelous presentation from the Department of Insurance with 20 pages of slides that were put together as a handout.

1695
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
In living color.

1696
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:31,000
my understanding with the notes that i took that day which would have been the 17th of october that there was that was we were waiting for a draft bulletin by the insurance department do we know before i go on if that draft has been uh that's That's a different bill, isn't it?

1697
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
Final decision.

1698
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
Let's see.

1699
01:59:35,000 --> 02:00:19,500
Is this another one um no i think that was that was the man on this one that was the mental health one the bulletin okay there was only a mental um no a bulletin yeah the mental health All right, so okay, so scrap that as I understand it the the issue here was with respect to a to reconsiderations of claims that had some sort of problem in that there was a by statute there's a 45-day period during which the reconsideration process is to be completed.

1700
02:00:19,500 --> 02:00:29,500
Now, the problem that we heard is that not all of those issues are being resolved within the 45-day period.

1701
02:00:29,500 --> 02:00:55,500
nevertheless the way understand the, and I hope this is the final iteration of the bill that we had, was that if in fact the claim was not sent on to the next wicket in 45 days, that it must be considered as a clean claim and it has to be paid.

1702
02:00:55,500 --> 02:01:13,500
So the problem that we had as we really dove down into this was that there are multiple issues that could be at work with respect to what is going on within the 45-day time frame.

1703
02:01:13,500 --> 02:01:41,500
And so because the statute, the bill does not indicate that the claim may be paid, which of course means nothing, because if it may, it may not, and has no binding force, and that the word shall is retained, that this does not foresee or provide for any of the extenuating circumstances that were identified.

1704
02:01:41,500 --> 02:01:51,500
For that very reason, we believe it would be imprudent to enact this bill as it was presented to us.

1705
02:01:51,500 --> 02:01:56,500
And for that reason, the issue does not go away.

1706
02:01:56,500 --> 02:02:14,500
The issue not resolved but this is not a not the appropriate way to handle this given all that we heard and therefore um looping back uh yes mr chair i move ITL on SB 82.

1707
02:02:14,500 --> 02:02:17,000
Are you seconded by hon?

1708
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,000

Okay.

1710
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:25,500
Any discussion on the Any discussion on the motion?

1711
02:02:25,500 --> 02:02:42,000
Only to say that I thought this was an extraordinarily complicated issue and that the insurance department should be called out for assisting us greatly in coming to a better understanding of this.

1712
02:02:42,000 --> 02:03:48,500
Some of us coming from a fairly low point on the learning curve and having come to such clarity with respect not only to the process, which is very, very long and complicated, but in addition to identifying the real issues that are at work here and how difficult this is going to be to resolve thank you yeah and I remember just um the insurance division just saying that you know they can be phoned I mean they can they can have a you know conversation um and try to resolve it uh in in that way if they can or just more clarity like yes yes okay any more discussion on the motion seeing none the clerk will call the roll it on SB 82 Ammon yes thank you yes Tusek.

3 more.

1785
02:07:24,500 --> 02:07:34,500
Senate bill 198 directing the insurance department to conduct a cost study of providing coverages for certain reproductive health care.

1786
02:07:34,500 --> 02:07:37,000
Like to make a motion.

1787
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:39,000
Okay.

1788

Chairman.

1796
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:07,000
SB198, an act directing the insurance department to conduct a study providing coverage for certain reproductive health care.

1797
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:13,500
The state's already done this study and given this report to this committee.

1798
02:08:13,500 --> 02:08:18,500
And the bottom line was it would be extremely expensive.

1799
02:08:18,500 --> 02:08:21,500
For that reason, I moved ATL.

1800
02:08:21,500 --> 02:09:19,000
and and the also the report points out because of the requirements under the affordable care act slash obamacare that um if the state if we were to pass this mandate and hope to provide it to all new hampshire citizens the state would have to pay for all individuals and small group insurance so that makes the cost of it not just the coverage expensive but now it would require a fiscal note okay any other discussion on the motion of an expedient to legislate seeing none the clerk will call the roll amon yes you yes tusick yes terry yes post yes cole yes richelli yes daxton yes walsh yes burrows Yes, yes.

1807
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:33,000

1808
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,000

02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,000
Okay, 19 to 0.

1832
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:27,500
All those in favor of placing on the consent calendar, please say aye.

1833
02:10:27,500 --> 02:10:29,500
Aye.

1834
02:10:29,500 --> 02:10:31,500
Those opposed?

1835
02:10:31,500 --> 02:10:33,500

02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:47,500
Let me see if they're in here.

1841
02:10:47,500 --> 02:10:49,500
Page 2.

1842
02:10:49,500 --> 02:10:51,500
Okay.

1843
02:10:51,500 --> 02:10:53,500
All set.

1844
02:10:53,500 --> 02:10:55,500
All right.

1845
02:10:55,500 --> 02:11:00,000
Senate Bill 201 relative to resale of event tickets.

1846
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:03,000
I'd like to make a motion.

1847
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:05,000
Okay.

1848
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:09,500
I'd like to move interim study on this bill.

1849
02:11:09,500 --> 02:11:11,500
Interim study.

1850
02:11:11,500 --> 02:11:13,500
That's fine.

1851
02:11:13,500 --> 02:11:17,500

Yes, please.

1853
02:11:19,500 --> 02:11:21,500
Okay.

1854
02:11:21,500 --> 02:11:43,500
The reason I'm, I know that we had concerns about the enforceability of this bill, but since then, the Senate has been working with the Attorney General's office who believe that there are some things that can be done under the Consumer Protection Act.

1855
02:11:43,500 --> 02:15:50,000
So I think it behooves us to put this on interim study and take a look at at what they've come up with okay the pending motion is interim study any discussion on the motion all right see none the clerk will call the roll Ammon yes you yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes Yes.
