00:22:45.549 --> 00:22:45.559 align:start position:0%
come home to his family because he gave
 
00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:47.320 align:start position:0%
his life protecting those around him at
 
00:22:49.549 --> 00:22:49.559 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital Chief Bradley hos
 
00:22:52.029 --> 00:22:52.039 align:start position:0%
was a true hero we will never forget him
 
00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:54.200 align:start position:0%
and we'll never stop being grateful for
 
00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:55.190 align:start position:0%
and we'll never stop being grateful for
his

00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
his
 
00:22:57.789 --> 00:22:57.799 align:start position:0%
bravery our pats on the back today so to
 
00:22:58.870 --> 00:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
say say they're they're not going to
 
00:23:01.149 --> 00:23:01.159 align:start position:0%
bring bad Bradley back they also won't
 
00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
bring opportunities to families any
 
00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:05.720 align:start position:0%
faster but my hope is that it will give
 
00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:07.480 align:start position:0%
them confidence that New Hampshire has
 
00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:09.480 align:start position:0%
the right approach and the attention to
 
00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:11.320 align:start position:0%
individuals we're always willing to go
 
00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
the extra mile to be Innovative in
 
00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:16.400 align:start position:0%
providing opportunities to everyone so
 
00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
let's start with everyone's favorite
 
00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:21.080 align:start position:0%
topic politics he said to a room of
 
00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:23.960 align:start position:0%
politicians so less than a month ago uh
 
00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:25.880 align:start position:0%
our nation once again turned its eyes
 
00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
towards New Hampshire just as we have
 
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
for the last last 100 years we hosted
 
00:23:38.269 --> 00:23:38.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
primer now our place at the front of the
 
00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:43.000 align:start position:0%
nomination calendar is never a given it
 
00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:45.440 align:start position:0%
is always fought for earned and won we
 
00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
take our responsibility of getting the
 
00:23:50.549 --> 00:23:50.559 align:start position:0%
process right uh we take it very serious
 
00:23:52.149 --> 00:23:52.159 align:start position:0%

really made sure that this went off
 
00:24:26.789 --> 00:24:26.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:26.799 --> 00:24:29.070 align:start position:0%

is so New Hampshire was a banner uh 2023
 
00:24:47.549 --> 00:24:47.559 align:start position:0%
was a banner year for New Hampshire uh
 
00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:49.480 align:start position:0%
we had opportunities and we achieved an
 
00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:51.480 align:start position:0%
advancing Freedom we increased uh
 
00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
opportunities in our economies we put
 
00:24:55.549 --> 00:24:55.559 align:start position:0%
our families first and now you may have
 
00:24:57.310 --> 00:24:57.320 align:start position:0%
heard some of these data points before
 
00:24:58.590 --> 00:24:58.600 align:start position:0%
cuz I do like like to brag about them
 
00:25:00.669 --> 00:25:00.679 align:start position:0%
and in other speeches but in just the
 
00:25:03.789 --> 00:25:03.799 align:start position:0%
last year New Hampshire was rent the
 
00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:05.960 align:start position:0%
number one state for overall Freedom the
 
00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
number one state for economic freedom
 
00:25:09.389 --> 00:25:09.399 align:start position:0%
the number one state for child
 
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
well-being and we will continue working
 
00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
to ensure that we maintain the lowest
 
00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
poverty rate in the country great job
 
00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:24.200 align:start position:0%
job so those are some of the big
 
00:25:25.789 --> 00:25:25.799 align:start position:0%
headline ones some folks may have seen
 
00:25:27.269 --> 00:25:27.279 align:start position:0%
those before but there are a few
 
00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
rankings that maybe went under the radar
 
00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
but I do want to acknowledge did you
 
00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
know that this past year for the first
 
00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:35.080 align:start position:0%
time ever our correction system was
 
00:25:37.029 --> 00:25:37.039 align:start position:0%
ranked the best in the country so hats
 
00:25:42.269 --> 00:25:42.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
job or did you know that New Hampshire
 
00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
was the first state in the nation with a
 
00:25:50.029 --> 00:25:50.039 align:start position:0%
nationally approved cyber security plan
 
00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:52.440 align:start position:0%
uh nothing uh not an easy task and
 
00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
something that is on the Forefront of
 
00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:55.720 align:start position:0%
everything we do nowadays so again great
 
00:26:01.269 --> 00:26:01.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is now ranked as the best
 
00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:06.200 align:start position:0%
return on investment for taxpayers
 
00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
number one I like to call that the
 
00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
efficient government award so again
 
00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:11.480 align:start position:0%
living a to a gold standard for the rest
 
00:26:13.669 --> 00:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
country here's one New Hampshire in two
 
00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
separate reports New Hampshire is now
 
00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
ranked as having both the smartest and
 
00:26:23.389 --> 00:26:23.399 align:start position:0%
one of the most productive workforces in
 
00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
the country a Real Testament to our
 
00:26:27.149 --> 00:26:27.159 align:start position:0%
citizens and that is a big part of why
 
00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
businesses are coming here from all over
 
00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:29.669 align:start position:0%
businesses are coming here from all over
the

00:26:29.669 --> 00:26:29.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:32.120 align:start position:0%
country and I would be remiss I don't
 
00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
know I'd be remiss I'm looking for him
 
00:26:35.669 --> 00:26:35.679 align:start position:0%
somewhere uh if I didn't give a little
 
00:26:37.549 --> 00:26:37.559 align:start position:0%
shout out to commissioner Bill Cass and
 
00:26:39.669 --> 00:26:39.679 align:start position:0%
his amazing team at the Department of
 
00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:41.440 align:start position:0%
Transportation uh not only are they
 
00:26:43.870 --> 00:26:43.880 align:start position:0%
doing a great job plowing our road well
 
00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:44.840 align:start position:0%
this year they're getting off a little
 
00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:46.200 align:start position:0%
easy on the plow the roads and they are
 
00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
great don't get me wrong they're great
 
00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
mother nature's been very kind but again
 
00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
for the first time ever uh New Hampshire
 
00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:53.240 align:start position:0%
has been listed in one of the reports as
 
00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
having the best roads in America so
 
00:26:59.440 --> 00:26:59.450 align:start position:0%
great job bill
 
00:26:59.450 --> 00:27:01.070 align:start position:0%
great job bill
[Applause]

00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
[Applause]
 
00:27:02.269 --> 00:27:02.279 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't think it means we don't
 
00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
have any potholes but ours I guess are
 
00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
more pleasant than most I don't
 
00:27:08.909 --> 00:27:08.919 align:start position:0%
know um so look we could keep going on
 
00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:10.640 align:start position:0%
with a lot of these accolades but uh we
 
00:27:12.549 --> 00:27:12.559 align:start position:0%
we would be here all day um I know
 
00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
you're all getting anxious to get back
 
00:27:17.029 --> 00:27:17.039 align:start position:0%
to work um so we don't want to take the
 
00:27:18.909 --> 00:27:18.919 align:start position:0%
successes for granted right because
 
00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:21.200 align:start position:0%
continued success is not inevitable we
 
00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:23.000 align:start position:0%
must continually challenge ourselves
 
00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:25.720 align:start position:0%
putting individuals before the system to
 
00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:27.880 align:start position:0%
strive to be better stewards of tax pair
 
00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
dollars and more accountable to the
 
00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:30.440 align:start position:0%
people of the
 
00:27:33.269 --> 00:27:33.279 align:start position:0%
state being the best is earned it is not
 
00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:35.000 align:start position:0%
given and that is what has guided us
 
00:27:37.149 --> 00:27:37.159 align:start position:0%
this last 7 years and that is what will
 
00:27:39.549 --> 00:27:39.559 align:start position:0%
take us into more successes into the
 
00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
future so I still believe with all these
 
00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
great rankings one of the greatest
 
00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:44.840 align:start position:0%
achievements and I really believe this
 
00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
sincerely one of the greatest
 
00:27:47.549 --> 00:27:47.559 align:start position:0%
achievements that we have had and
 
00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:49.880 align:start position:0%
conquered was the passage of last year's
 
00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
bipartisan balanced budget with an
 
00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
evenly divided legislature on a on a
 
00:27:56.990 --> 00:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
Voice vote and that is just an amazing
 
00:27:59.110 --> 00:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
Testament to this body to the folks that
 
00:28:02.029 --> 00:28:02.039 align:start position:0%
work tirelessly in the state house um uh
 
00:28:03.389 --> 00:28:03.399 align:start position:0%
it didn't come with any gimmicks or
 
00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:05.200 align:start position:0%
empty promises it was achieved with a
 
00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
lot of hard work and so that is my
 
00:28:09.389 --> 00:28:09.399 align:start position:0%
personal thanks on behalf of the 1.4
 
00:28:11.509 --> 00:28:11.519 align:start position:0%
million constituents of this state to
 
00:28:17.909 --> 00:28:17.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:20.389 --> 00:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
done and that wasn't any small budget
 
00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:22.240 align:start position:0%
there is a lot to be proud of that you
 
00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
guys were able to achieve in that budget
 
00:28:25.509 --> 00:28:25.519 align:start position:0%
it ensured an eighth straight year in
 
00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire with no new taxes the full
 
00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:33.200 align:start position:0%

number one issues uh across New
 
00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:02.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the one I love the most
 
00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:04.360 align:start position:0%
after Decades of inaction we
 
00:29:06.149 --> 00:29:06.159 align:start position:0%
reconstructed the education funding
 
00:29:08.549 --> 00:29:08.559 align:start position:0%
formula ensuring efficiency fairness and
 
00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:10.840 align:start position:0%
adding hundreds of millions of dollars
 
00:29:12.789 --> 00:29:12.799 align:start position:0%
for the students of the state it it is a
 
00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:17.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:20.360 align:start position:0%
job New Hampshire leads from the front
 
00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:22.360 align:start position:0%
we do not follow that has been tried and
 
00:29:24.509 --> 00:29:24.519 align:start position:0%
true for a couple hundred years now so
 
00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
every policy Victory every economic win
 
00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:28.760 align:start position:0%
and record breaking statistic has been
 
00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:30.360 align:start position:0%
the direct result of that hard work
 
00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:32.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal discipline sound government
 
00:29:34.389 --> 00:29:34.399 align:start position:0%
stewardship and we should all be proud
 
00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
and that in itself is the New Hampshire
 
00:29:39.149 --> 00:29:39.159 align:start position:0%
success story today New Hampshire is
 
00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
more prosperous than ever our economy
 
00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
was ranked as the fastest growing in the
 
00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
country last year at 8.1% becoming the
 
00:29:48.389 --> 00:29:48.399 align:start position:0%
Envy the nation and the best place in
 
00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:51.640 align:start position:0%
America to live work and raise a family
 
00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
businesses are moving here in droves
 
00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:56.360 align:start position:0%
after years of more people leaving the
 
00:29:58.669 --> 00:29:58.679 align:start position:0%
state I think I think through 20 2015 we
 
00:29:59.909 --> 00:29:59.919 align:start position:0%
had something like six straight years of
 
00:30:01.149 --> 00:30:01.159 align:start position:0%
more people leaving the state than
 
00:30:03.909 --> 00:30:03.919 align:start position:0%
moving in since 2015 we've had a surge
 
00:30:06.389 --> 00:30:06.399 align:start position:0%
of domestic migration into New Hampshire
 
00:30:08.149 --> 00:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
resulting more in more people working
 
00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:11.080 align:start position:0%

there's no doubt about it businesses
 
00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:31.480 align:start position:0%
cannot be successful without Workforce
 
00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:33.080 align:start position:0%
and there won't be a Workforce unless we
 
00:31:34.509 --> 00:31:34.519 align:start position:0%
have the housing this is something we've
 
00:31:36.149 --> 00:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
really felt the burden of all across the
 
00:31:37.629 --> 00:31:37.639 align:start position:0%
country but here in New Hampshire is no
 
00:31:39.509 --> 00:31:39.519 align:start position:0%
exception uh for the past couple of
 
00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:41.960 align:start position:0%
years families and work workers are the
 
00:31:44.149 --> 00:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
backbone of a strong thriving State and
 
00:31:46.909 --> 00:31:46.919 align:start position:0%
without housing our Economic Opportunity
 
00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
suffers which is why with your support
 
00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:51.880 align:start position:0%
we are able to launch our invest New
 
00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:54.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire invest NH housing fund a first
 
00:31:56.350 --> 00:31:56.360 align:start position:0%
ofit kind fund to incentivize the
 
00:31:58.310 --> 00:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
construction of new housing projects
 
00:31:59.870 --> 00:31:59.880 align:start position:0%
this was just a couple years ago and the
 
00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:02.720 align:start position:0%
goal was to get permits out and houses
 
00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:05.480 align:start position:0%
up then the initial results are in in
 
00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:07.240 align:start position:0%
this past month and it has been an
 
00:32:09.549 --> 00:32:09.559 align:start position:0%
immediate success since launching the
 
00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
program two short years ago the total
 
00:32:13.629 --> 00:32:13.639 align:start position:0%
number of permits issued for residential
 
00:32:15.629 --> 00:32:15.639 align:start position:0%
construction has doubled our
 
00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
expectations in just this past year more
 
00:32:20.029 --> 00:32:20.039 align:start position:0%
permits issued in more than a decade and
 
00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:21.880 align:start position:0%
we're now on track to bring thousands of
 
00:32:25.549 --> 00:32:25.559 align:start position:0%
new units online by all through 2024 so
 
00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:27.720 align:start position:0%
already we have uh under the invest in h
 
00:32:29.149 --> 00:32:29.159 align:start position:0%
fund we have housing developments that
 
00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
have been completed in conquered in
 
00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:34.200 align:start position:0%
Conway Manchester Lebanon Littleton um
 
00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:36.200 align:start position:0%
almost all of which is Workforce housing
 
00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
which is exactly what the state's need
 
00:32:40.669 --> 00:32:40.679 align:start position:0%
it's a win for New Hampshire and again I
 
00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:43.240 align:start position:0%
thank the legislature for making it all
 
00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
happen so let's take a step back a
 
00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:46.840 align:start position:0%
little bit and we can discuss some of
 
00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
our Landmark strides in uh in the few
 
00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
years surrounding opportunities around
 
00:32:55.230 --> 00:32:55.240 align:start position:0%
kids and education obviously a Paramount
 
00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
discussion that we continually have in
 
00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:00.360 align:start position:0%
conquered now we can go back to the days
 
00:33:02.549 --> 00:33:02.559 align:start position:0%
when the balance of our education trust
 
00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:05.960 align:start position:0%
fund was negative by about $52 million
 
00:33:08.149 --> 00:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
and if you were in the four walls of
 
00:33:09.549 --> 00:33:09.559 align:start position:0%
that traditional classroom and it wasn't
 
00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
working for your kid you were stuck you
 
00:33:12.909 --> 00:33:12.919 align:start position:0%
were out of luck but that is not where

we are today not anymore next year the
 
00:33:17.629 --> 00:33:17.639 align:start position:0%

00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
right here in conquer for finally
 
00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:26.440 align:start position:0%
passing the education Freedom accounts
 
00:33:28.789 --> 00:33:28.799 align:start position:0%

ship them to the schools that's not what
 
00:35:16.829 --> 00:35:16.839 align:start position:0%
we did at all um the the new first
 
00:35:19.829 --> 00:35:19.839 align:start position:0%
robotics xrp robots they're now shipping
 
00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
out but this is the way they did it
 
00:35:24.829 --> 00:35:24.839 align:start position:0%
which I thought was really cool we're
 
00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:27.160 align:start position:0%
the students are making the robots not
 
00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
assembling them they literally are
 
00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
building them in the 3D uh print Farms
 
00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:34.640 align:start position:0%
right so the students are kind of
 
00:35:35.950 --> 00:35:35.960 align:start position:0%
vertically integrating what they're
 
00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
doing they're building the parts to the
 
00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:39.720 align:start position:0%
robot they're getting involved with
 
00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
supply chain and Manufacturing they're
 
00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
putting them in their packages this is a
 
00:35:45.109 --> 00:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
combination of high school students
 
00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:47.160 align:start position:0%
working with the community colleges and
 
00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:48.760 align:start position:0%
then they send them to other students in
 
00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:51.200 align:start position:0%
the state to learn how to use them well
 
00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:53.720 align:start position:0%
at the same time the teachers have a
 
00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:55.480 align:start position:0%
free opportunity to take classes to
 
00:35:57.790 --> 00:35:57.800 align:start position:0%
learn how to teach to them and at the
 
00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
same time you all passed an opportunity
 
00:36:02.349 --> 00:36:02.359 align:start position:0%
to give incentive bonuses to any school
 
00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:03.880 align:start position:0%
teacher in the state that wants to
 
00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
become a computer science teacher it's
 
00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
so vertically integrated but I'm telling
 
00:36:10.309 --> 00:36:10.319 align:start position:0%
you what you guys did is amazing this is
 
00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
the future it's opening up all these
 
00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:14.440 align:start position:0%
opportunities of Technology not just for
 
00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:16.640 align:start position:0%
a few students but for every student and
 
00:36:18.349 --> 00:36:18.359 align:start position:0%
not just for a few teachers but for
 
00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
every teacher for everyone to
 
00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:22.480 align:start position:0%
participate in that opportunity this is
 
00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
where Workforce is going this is the
 
00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:26.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity that we can give kids for
 
00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:28.520 align:start position:0%
real world skills um and again not just
 
00:36:30.069 --> 00:36:30.079 align:start position:0%
in their senior or junior year but up
 
00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:31.880 align:start position:0%
and down for every single classroom so I
 
00:36:33.829 --> 00:36:33.839 align:start position:0%
thought that was an amazing uh program
 
00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:35.440 align:start position:0%
Dean came in and and his folks are
 
00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:37.240 align:start position:0%
working again in conjunction with the
 
00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:38.920 align:start position:0%
community colleges and the and the high
 
00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:41.200 align:start position:0%
schools um when I went to this 3D print
 
00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
farm and there were literally like you
 
00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
know 40 different printers printing
 
00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:47.200 align:start position:0%
these pieces um really taking it from
 
00:36:49.349 --> 00:36:49.359 align:start position:0%
the supply chain all the way to seeing a
 
00:36:51.390 --> 00:36:51.400 align:start position:0%
kid in that classroom using that that
 
00:36:53.829 --> 00:36:53.839 align:start position:0%
device I thought it was amazing example
 
00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
of making sure that kids have an
 
00:36:56.829 --> 00:36:56.839 align:start position:0%
experiential something something
 
00:36:58.870 --> 00:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
learning and experiential at every step
 
00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:07.870 --> 00:37:07.880 align:start position:0%
great now there's one more aspect of
 
00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:09.640 align:start position:0%
Education I do want to touch upon
 
00:37:12.069 --> 00:37:12.079 align:start position:0%
earlier this year um I created a special
 
00:37:14.589 --> 00:37:14.599 align:start position:0%
task force to look at uh kind of a new
 
00:37:18.309 --> 00:37:18.319 align:start position:0%
21st century model for post-secondary
 
00:37:20.309 --> 00:37:20.319 align:start position:0%
Education uh I've asked the community
 
00:37:22.270 --> 00:37:22.280 align:start position:0%
colleges in the University system some
 
00:37:24.069 --> 00:37:24.079 align:start position:0%
folks in the business World some some
 
00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:26.200 align:start position:0%
folks in the public sector uh to really
 
00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
consider where the models for these
 
00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
opportunities are headed it is changing
 
00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:33.160 align:start position:0%
drastically when you become 17 18 years
 
00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
old it isn't just we're going to apply
 
00:37:36.270 --> 00:37:36.280 align:start position:0%
to some schools and go there's so many
 
00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:37.640 align:start position:0%
there's such a host of opportunities
 
00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
especially in this post-pandemic world
 
00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:41.560 align:start position:0%
more online opportunities whatever it
 
00:37:44.349 --> 00:37:44.359 align:start position:0%
might be so we've really challenged them
 
00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
to look at what's happening uh
 
00:37:47.829 --> 00:37:47.839 align:start position:0%
throughout that process and make sure
 
00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:49.560 align:start position:0%
that we're staying ahead of that curve
 
00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:51.200 align:start position:0%
and if we don't if we just kind of
 
00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
whistle past the graveyard we're going
 
00:37:54.430 --> 00:37:54.440 align:start position:0%
to see declining enrollments and we'll
 
00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
really be scrambling in a crisis now at
 
00:37:58.270 --> 00:37:58.280 align:start position:0%
the the same time I do want to I'd be
 
00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
remiss if I didn't give out a shout out
 
00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
and I thank you uh University of New
 
00:38:04.109 --> 00:38:04.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh is we have a great
 
00:38:05.470 --> 00:38:05.480 align:start position:0%
president in James Dean I think he's
 
00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
done a fantastic job over there he is
 
00:38:09.349 --> 00:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
retiring so we'll be bringing somebody
 
00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
in uh new on that level so that's we
 
00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
thank Jim for uh James for his service
 
00:38:16.069 --> 00:38:16.079 align:start position:0%
uh but there's opportunity there as well
 
00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:17.560 align:start position:0%
and it's not just combining the systems
 
00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:19.000 align:start position:0%
or what it might be but really making
 
00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:21.160 align:start position:0%
sure we're looking at those college and
 
00:38:23.069 --> 00:38:23.079 align:start position:0%
Community College opportunities from the
 
00:38:24.670 --> 00:38:24.680 align:start position:0%
customer perspective I'm passionate
 
00:38:26.069 --> 00:38:26.079 align:start position:0%
about it because I'm starting to tour
 
00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
colleges with my own daughter right and
 
00:38:29.710 --> 00:38:29.720 align:start position:0%
try try to see what what her is and so
 
00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:32.560 align:start position:0%
as a as a constituent as as a consumer
 
00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:34.200 align:start position:0%
if you will we're going through this as
 
00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:35.480 align:start position:0%
the family in terms of what all the
 
00:38:37.589 --> 00:38:37.599 align:start position:0%
options are uh the traditional models of
 
00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:39.480 align:start position:0%
college and and Community College don't
 
00:38:41.109 --> 00:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
work for everyone anymore but I think if
 
00:38:42.829 --> 00:38:42.839 align:start position:0%
we stay ahead of it we I think we have a
 
00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
a great opportunity with this task force
 
00:38:47.349 --> 00:38:47.359 align:start position:0%
and I'm excited to see uh what they'll
 
00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
what they'll be bringing us to ensure
 
00:38:51.349 --> 00:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire remains competitive
 
00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:53.400 align:start position:0%
um and while I'm on the subject of of
 
00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:55.640 align:start position:0%
colleges and post-secondary education
 
00:38:57.309 --> 00:38:57.319 align:start position:0%
you know one of the or one of the
 
00:38:59.670 --> 00:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
institutions uh I we don't often
 
00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
recognize uh here in conquer uh they're
 
00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:04.240 align:start position:0%
a private institution but a great
 
00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
institution is the great work done by
 
00:39:09.309 --> 00:39:09.319 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth College so let's take a little
 
00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
bit of a step back we have seen all
 
00:39:13.390 --> 00:39:13.400 align:start position:0%
across the country a lot of this growing
 
00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
hateful anti anti-semitic rhetoric
 
00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
across some of America's great college
 
00:39:20.910 --> 00:39:20.920 align:start position:0%
campuses and frankly I I personally
 
00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
think that the actions of many of the
 
00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
Ivy League schools in America as it
 
00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:25.240 align:start position:0%
pertains to this crisis I think it's
 
00:39:27.069 --> 00:39:27.079 align:start position:0%
been terrible I've even for some of the
 
00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
presidents of the Ivy Leagues to resign
 
00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:31.160 align:start position:0%
but I want to very much applaud the
 
00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
efforts of President Cen belock uh the
 
00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
new president over at Dartmouth in just
 
00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:38.040 align:start position:0%
her first year she has set Dartmouth
 
00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
apart and led as an example of ensuring
 
00:39:42.589 --> 00:39:42.599 align:start position:0%
free spe free speech and respect on
 
00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:44.960 align:start position:0%
campus uh and guess what I mean she used
 
00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
the situation to bring students together
 
00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
and make sure it was an educational
 
00:39:51.589 --> 00:39:51.599 align:start position:0%
process an educational form to learn on
 
00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
this issue and those students have very
 
00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:55.720 align:start position:0%
much responded in kind the rest of the
 
00:39:57.790 --> 00:39:57.800 align:start position:0%
ivy league schol schools are now looking
 
00:39:59.950 --> 00:39:59.960 align:start position:0%
as at Dartmouth as the example to follow
 
00:40:01.109 --> 00:40:01.119 align:start position:0%
and I just want to take the opportunity
 
00:40:02.430 --> 00:40:02.440 align:start position:0%
to thank her and her team for
 
00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:05.870 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:10.790 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:13.069 --> 00:40:13.079 align:start position:0%
well changing gears a little bit you
 
00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
know I go back to when I first got
 
00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:16.520 align:start position:0%
elected even during the campaign one
 
00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
thing I said a lot was that mental
 
00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
health mental health was the unspoken
 
00:40:22.309 --> 00:40:22.319 align:start position:0%
crisis of the time it was ignored the
 
00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:24.440 align:start position:0%
system was absolutely fractured but with
 
00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:25.640 align:start position:0%
a lot of the new funding that this
 
00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
legislature has moved forward the
 
00:40:29.230 --> 00:40:29.240 align:start position:0%
revamped programs an emphasis on
 
00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:31.640 align:start position:0%
prioritizing people over bureaucracy we
 
00:40:34.109 --> 00:40:34.119 align:start position:0%
have turned the tide now we're finally
 
00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
giving families a sense that in their
 
00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
toughest times there is a system that
 
00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
can be focused on some better Solutions
 
00:40:41.589 --> 00:40:41.599 align:start position:0%
thousands of New Hampshire families
 
00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:43.720 align:start position:0%
today are struggling with mental health
 
00:40:46.430 --> 00:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
issues in a variety of forms so why is
 
00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:47.800 align:start position:0%
there good cause for Hope knowing that
 
00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:49.400 align:start position:0%
you can have so many families out there
 
00:40:51.349 --> 00:40:51.359 align:start position:0%
struggling with this in all these
 
00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
different ways well let's take again a
 
00:40:54.670 --> 00:40:54.680 align:start position:0%
step back just a few years ago we
 
00:40:56.589 --> 00:40:56.599 align:start position:0%
challenged ourselves with a bold 10-year
 
00:40:58.270 --> 00:40:58.280 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Plan and it was bold it
 
00:41:00.030 --> 00:41:00.040 align:start position:0%
was stakeholder driven we didn't have
 
00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:01.640 align:start position:0%
bureaucrats write it we went out and
 
00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
talked to the families we talked to the
 
00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
students we talked to the kids we found
 
00:41:06.309 --> 00:41:06.319 align:start position:0%
out where the system had been failing
 
00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
them and then challenged ourselves to go
 
00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
after a lot of those barriers and this
 
00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:11.480 align:start position:0%
legislature has been aggressive and
 
00:41:13.829 --> 00:41:13.839 align:start position:0%
taking on all those recommendations now
 
00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:16.040 align:start position:0%

00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
summer the Department of Health and
 
00:41:19.349 --> 00:41:19.359 align:start position:0%

Hampshire now has the lowest rate in the
 
00:42:36.030 --> 00:42:36.040 align:start position:0%
country so there's a lot of work ahead
 
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
of us but these transformational changes
 
00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:40.160 align:start position:0%

00:42:41.829 --> 00:42:41.839 align:start position:0%

know that more always has to be done and
 
00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:12.480 align:start position:0%

00:44:58.870 --> 00:44:58.880 align:start position:0%
Texas problem this is a national crisis
 
00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:00.200 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire has the chance to
 
00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
provide specialized support follow the
 
00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:04.800 align:start position:0%

00:46:16.190 --> 00:46:16.200 align:start position:0%
no doubt about it times in New Hampshire
 
00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
are good good management fiscal prudence
 
00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:21.400 align:start position:0%
and a limited government worldview guide
 
00:46:23.109 --> 00:46:23.119 align:start position:0%
our decision-making over these last
 
00:46:24.589 --> 00:46:24.599 align:start position:0%
seven years New Hampshire has stood out
 
00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
as a beacon of success and a safe haven
 
00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:28.480 align:start position:0%
for freedom and
 
00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:30.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity we have all put in the hard
 
00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:32.720 align:start position:0%
work and this is what a true this has
 
00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:34.640 align:start position:0%
always been a true team effort we fought
 
00:46:36.790 --> 00:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
for lower taxes and it worked we fought
 
00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
for more efficient government and it
 
00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:40.640 align:start position:0%
worked we fought for local control and
 
00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:42.640 align:start position:0%
decentralized government it worked we
 
00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
fought for the rights of the individual
 
00:46:46.910 --> 00:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
putting them before government and it
 
00:46:49.510 --> 00:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
worked when we had one-time funds come
 
00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:51.240 align:start position:0%
in instead of growing government or
 
00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:53.200 align:start position:0%
instituting massive new programs we
 
00:46:55.910 --> 00:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
focused on one-time projects instead of
 
00:46:57.990 --> 00:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
a governing with a one-size fits-all
 
00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
approach out of conquered we engage
 
00:47:01.829 --> 00:47:01.839 align:start position:0%
stakeholders we engage those local
 
00:47:04.069 --> 00:47:04.079 align:start position:0%
officials and those families shifting
 
00:47:06.109 --> 00:47:06.119 align:start position:0%
decision-making in government to those
 
00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
constituents on the front lines so if I
 
00:47:10.549 --> 00:47:10.559 align:start position:0%
have one message to leave for this
 
00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:12.760 align:start position:0%
legislature it is this you cannot to
 
00:47:14.750 --> 00:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
take our amazing success for granted
 
00:47:18.589 --> 00:47:18.599 align:start position:0%
fiscal Prudence definitely rules the day
 
00:47:19.990 --> 00:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
understand that for the average citizen
 
00:47:22.030 --> 00:47:22.040 align:start position:0%
out there personal debt it is at an
 
00:47:24.910 --> 00:47:24.920 align:start position:0%
alltime high inflation has skyrocketed
 
00:47:27.950 --> 00:47:27.960 align:start position:0%
across cost across to Everyday Americans
 
00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
by over 20% in just a few years many New
 
00:47:32.109 --> 00:47:32.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire families are struggling
 
00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
because of the just something as simple
 
00:47:36.309 --> 00:47:36.319 align:start position:0%
as high prices at the grocery store and
 
00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:38.240 align:start position:0%
these challenges are ofered beyond our
 
00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:41.480 align:start position:0%
control so now more than ever it's more
 
00:47:43.349 --> 00:47:43.359 align:start position:0%
important that we continue to minimize
 
00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:45.800 align:start position:0%
the state's burden on taxpayers ensure
 
00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
that the services we provide focus on
 
00:47:50.309 --> 00:47:50.319 align:start position:0%
serving that individual and not just the
 
00:47:52.230 --> 00:47:52.240 align:start position:0%
system responsible management of
 
00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars will be of the utmost
 
00:47:57.430 --> 00:47:57.440 align:start position:0%
importance if a recession hits and I'm
 
00:47:58.750 --> 00:47:58.760 align:start position:0%
still a little concerned a recession
 
00:48:00.750 --> 00:48:00.760 align:start position:0%
across this country very much could hit
 
00:48:02.910 --> 00:48:02.920 align:start position:0%
it is our job as Leaders to make sure
 
00:48:04.750 --> 00:48:04.760 align:start position:0%
that we're the last state to hit into
 
00:48:06.630 --> 00:48:06.640 align:start position:0%
the recession and the first state to get
 
00:48:09.549 --> 00:48:09.559 align:start position:0%
out but that requires restraint we are
 
00:48:12.109 --> 00:48:12.119 align:start position:0%
strategic in New Hampshire we plan we
 
00:48:13.630 --> 00:48:13.640 align:start position:0%
don't believe in just that okay
 
00:48:15.549 --> 00:48:15.559 align:start position:0%
government's going to get it done we do
 
00:48:18.069 --> 00:48:18.079 align:start position:0%
empow Empower that private sector to be
 
00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
partners in our
 
00:48:22.589 --> 00:48:22.599 align:start position:0%
success next year there'll be a new
 
00:48:24.309 --> 00:48:24.319 align:start position:0%
governor and a new legislature and new
 
00:48:25.950 --> 00:48:25.960 align:start position:0%
challenges to address oh we got a cheer
 
00:48:27.670 --> 00:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
for that
 
00:48:30.549 --> 00:48:30.559 align:start position:0%
one that was
 
00:48:33.390 --> 00:48:33.400 align:start position:0%
funny but look we are so much better off
 
00:48:35.190 --> 00:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
when we are working together and it's up
 
00:48:37.150 --> 00:48:37.160 align:start position:0%
to each of you that return next year to
 
00:48:38.910 --> 00:48:38.920 align:start position:0%
bring that same level of energy
 
00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:41.240 align:start position:0%
cooperativeness and bipartisanship that
 
00:48:43.349 --> 00:48:43.359 align:start position:0%
has helped us achieve so much together
 
00:48:45.750 --> 00:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire truly has set a gold
 
00:48:47.829 --> 00:48:47.839 align:start position:0%
standard now I'm not going in any
 
00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
anywhere any anywhere anytime soon don't
 
00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
get too excited you can keep the cheers
 
00:48:54.230 --> 00:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
for another 10 months so let's keep
 
00:48:55.910 --> 00:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
working hard let's keep doing it as a
 
00:48:57.470 --> 00:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
team we can have our differences and the
 
00:48:59.150 --> 00:48:59.160 align:start position:0%
political divide that's okay but at the
 
00:49:00.910 --> 00:49:00.920 align:start position:0%
end of the day we have a great record
 
00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:02.720 align:start position:0%

colleagues I rise today against the
 
00:56:21.150 --> 00:56:21.160 align:start position:0%
ought to pass motion on this bill this
 
00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:24.200 align:start position:0%
bill would increase the free launch
 
00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:25.430 align:start position:0%
bill would increase the free launch
program

00:56:25.430 --> 00:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:56:27.870 --> 00:56:27.880 align:start position:0%
from 180% of federal poverty level to
 
00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
350% of federal poverty level and it
 
00:56:33.870 --> 00:56:33.880 align:start position:0%
does so um with 100% New Hampshire
 
00:56:35.710 --> 00:56:35.720 align:start position:0%
taxpayer funds with no hope for any
 
00:56:37.270 --> 00:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
amount of reimbursement from the federal
 
00:56:38.750 --> 00:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
government for
 
00:56:42.150 --> 00:56:42.160 align:start position:0%
this the language within the bill itself
 
00:56:45.750 --> 00:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
is slightly unclear as to whether one or
 
00:56:47.630 --> 00:56:47.640 align:start position:0%
two meals would be required per day
 
00:56:50.109 --> 00:56:50.119 align:start position:0%
resulting in competing fiscal analyses
 
00:56:51.309 --> 00:56:51.319 align:start position:0%
of this
 
00:56:55.390 --> 00:56:55.400 align:start position:0%
bill that put the final cost anywhere
 
00:56:59.430 --> 00:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
from 50 million per year to perhaps 100
 
00:57:02.430 --> 00:57:02.440 align:start position:0%
million per year or
 
00:57:05.430 --> 00:57:05.440 align:start position:0%
higher currently not all schools even
 
00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:08.240 align:start position:0%
opt into this program so the very Act of
 
00:57:10.230 --> 00:57:10.240 align:start position:0%
passing this legislation and requiring
 
00:57:12.069 --> 00:57:12.079 align:start position:0%
them to do so would represent an
 
00:57:14.430 --> 00:57:14.440 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate on these schools
 
00:57:16.510 --> 00:57:16.520 align:start position:0%
requiring them to build facilities that
 
00:57:19.829 --> 00:57:19.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:22.190 --> 00:57:22.200 align:start position:0%
have and as I said this is pure New
 
00:57:25.069 --> 00:57:25.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire taxpayer money yet it expands
 
00:57:27.670 --> 00:57:27.680 align:start position:0%
a federal program now what that means is
 
00:57:30.829 --> 00:57:30.839 align:start position:0%
we have zero ability to direct exactly
 
00:57:33.109 --> 00:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
where we want these funds to go because
 
00:57:36.069 --> 00:57:36.079 align:start position:0%
all federal USDA program mandates still
 
00:57:38.470 --> 00:57:38.480 align:start position:0%
apply to this money even though it's New
 
00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:40.589 align:start position:0%
apply to this money even though it's New
Hampshire

00:57:40.589 --> 00:57:40.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:57:43.710 --> 00:57:43.720 align:start position:0%
money the USDA program has been
 
00:57:45.710 --> 00:57:45.720 align:start position:0%
demonstrated out of a study in Boston to
 
00:57:49.789 --> 00:57:49.799 align:start position:0%
be very wasteful 30% 30% waste product
 
00:57:52.270 --> 00:57:52.280 align:start position:0%
from this program they attribute that
 
00:57:55.069 --> 00:57:55.079 align:start position:0%
per studies to the inherent UNP
 
00:57:57.430 --> 00:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
palatability of the foods because they
 
00:58:01.510 --> 00:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
don't emphasize quality in this program
 
00:58:03.390 --> 00:58:03.400 align:start position:0%
the nutrition guidelines themselves are
 
00:58:05.950 --> 00:58:05.960 align:start position:0%
very controversial they're very old
 
00:58:08.910 --> 00:58:08.920 align:start position:0%
guidelines they are very carbohydrate
 
00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:11.069 align:start position:0%
guidelines they are very carbohydrate
heavy

00:58:11.069 --> 00:58:11.079 align:start position:0%

guidelines
 
00:58:17.069 --> 00:58:17.079 align:start position:0%
finally we heard numbers regarding food
 
00:58:19.789 --> 00:58:19.799 align:start position:0%
insecurity we did not hear numbers on
 
00:58:21.349 --> 00:58:21.359 align:start position:0%
food insufficiency and let me tell you
 
00:58:23.430 --> 00:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
the difference they wanted to emphasize
 
00:58:25.270 --> 00:58:25.280 align:start position:0%
to us the numbers of food Security in
 
00:58:27.349 --> 00:58:27.359 align:start position:0%
the state are very high the definition
 
00:58:29.349 --> 00:58:29.359 align:start position:0%
for food insecurity is I don't have
 
00:58:32.470 --> 00:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
enough of the specific food that I want
 
00:58:36.549 --> 00:58:36.559 align:start position:0%
to eat how does a child answer that
 
00:58:39.470 --> 00:58:39.480 align:start position:0%
question the N food insecurity I'm sorry
 
00:58:41.510 --> 00:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
insufficiency on the other hand is
 
00:58:44.109 --> 00:58:44.119 align:start position:0%
actually the number of students who
 
00:58:47.710 --> 00:58:47.720 align:start position:0%
don't have enough food period they would
 
00:58:49.430 --> 00:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
not give us those
 
00:58:51.670 --> 00:58:51.680 align:start position:0%
numbers we would like to see them before
 
00:58:54.349 --> 00:58:54.359 align:start position:0%
we expend this kind of money and I would
 
00:59:01.069 --> 00:59:01.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:09.750 --> 00:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:13.029 --> 00:59:13.039 align:start position:0%

00:59:40.190 --> 00:59:40.200 align:start position:0%
twofold one to support a wider range of
 
00:59:43.109 --> 00:59:43.119 align:start position:0%

curtailed at a time when many families

continue to struggle with the rising

least one nutritious meal per

day hunger that's really what this bill
 
01:00:45.150 --> 01:00:45.160 align:start position:0%
is about childhood hunger over half of
 
01:00:47.390 --> 01:00:47.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire children reportedly live
 
01:00:50.710 --> 01:00:50.720 align:start position:0%
in households with insufficient food
 
01:00:53.190 --> 01:00:53.200 align:start position:0%
imagine that some child's reality is
 
01:00:54.910 --> 01:00:54.920 align:start position:0%
they don't know when their next meal
 
01:00:57.789 --> 01:00:57.799 align:start position:0%
will be we're asking kids to be their
 
01:01:00.470 --> 01:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
best selves under the worst of
 
01:01:03.109 --> 01:01:03.119 align:start position:0%
circumstances we can do better than this
 
01:01:05.470 --> 01:01:05.480 align:start position:0%
and we must do better than this this
 
01:01:07.589 --> 01:01:07.599 align:start position:0%
bill is a positive step toward ending
 
01:01:09.510 --> 01:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
childhood hunger in New
 
01:01:12.349 --> 01:01:12.359 align:start position:0%

01:01:17.109 --> 01:01:17.119 align:start position:0%
as buses books computers internet access
 
01:01:19.270 --> 01:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
let's do our part to ensure that New
 
01:01:20.950 --> 01:01:20.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire kids have food in their
 
01:01:24.510 --> 01:01:24.520 align:start position:0%
bellies at least during their school day
 
01:01:26.870 --> 01:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
a former superintendent testified that
 
01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
the toughest part of his job was having
 
01:01:31.829 --> 01:01:31.839 align:start position:0%
to make the decision to cancel school
 
01:01:33.630 --> 01:01:33.640 align:start position:0%
knowing that some kids would not get a
 
01:01:37.910 --> 01:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
meal that day House Bill 1212 is our
 
01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:39.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity to commit to assisting
 
01:01:42.789 --> 01:01:42.799 align:start position:0%
Granite State families in reducing food
 
01:01:44.990 --> 01:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
insecurity our neighboring states of
 
01:01:48.109 --> 01:01:48.119 align:start position:0%
Vermont Maine and Massachusetts all have
 
01:01:49.990 --> 01:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
passed permanent Universal meals
 
01:01:53.069 --> 01:01:53.079 align:start position:0%
legislation which this bill is not but
 
01:01:55.829 --> 01:01:55.839 align:start position:0%
on that note I'd like to share a social
 
01:01:57.910 --> 01:01:57.920 align:start position:0%

lunch bills at gron elementary school

significant burden off the shoulders of

especially now that all students will

inquiry thank you very much Mr
 
01:04:36.630 --> 01:04:36.640 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know 38 schools do not
 
01:04:38.670 --> 01:04:38.680 align:start position:0%
currently participate in the national
 
01:04:42.109 --> 01:04:42.119 align:start position:0%
school lunch or breakfast programs that
 
01:04:44.589 --> 01:04:44.599 align:start position:0%
this state mandate requiring their
 
01:04:46.870 --> 01:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
participation is made without
 
01:04:50.670 --> 01:04:50.680 align:start position:0%
consideration for local control
 
01:04:52.710 --> 01:04:52.720 align:start position:0%
decisionmaking and if I also know the
 
01:04:54.670 --> 01:04:54.680 align:start position:0%
Bill's fiscal note estimate Ates the
 
01:04:57.630 --> 01:04:57.640 align:start position:0%
total cost of the program to be more
 
01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
than $50 million and potentially cost up
 
01:05:04.990 --> 01:05:05.000 align:start position:0%
to $75 million with all funds coming
 
01:05:07.710 --> 01:05:07.720 align:start position:0%
from the education trust fund regardless
 
01:05:11.990 --> 01:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
of other high priority needs and if I
 
01:05:14.269 --> 01:05:14.279 align:start position:0%
understand the bill not only disre
 
01:05:17.510 --> 01:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
disregards local decision making but
 
01:05:20.549 --> 01:05:20.559 align:start position:0%
will also have a significant financial
 
01:05:23.150 --> 01:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
impact on the education trust fund would
 
01:05:26.269 --> 01:05:26.279 align:start position:0%
I then press the red button so another
 
01:05:28.950 --> 01:05:28.960 align:start position:0%

01:05:39.630 --> 01:05:39.640 align:start position:0%
inquiry afternoon thank you Mr
 
01:05:42.510 --> 01:05:42.520 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that today everyone
 
01:05:45.349 --> 01:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
sitting in this room had the opportunity
 
01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
to attend a free breakfast or lunch and
 
01:05:51.309 --> 01:05:51.319 align:start position:0%
had the ability to pay for it but didn't
 
01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
have to and if I know the thousands of
 
01:05:55.789 --> 01:05:55.799 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire students from needy
 
01:05:58.630 --> 01:05:58.640 align:start position:0%
families did not or will not have either
 
01:06:01.990 --> 01:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
a breakfast or a lunch today free or
 
01:06:04.309 --> 01:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
otherwise and if I know that many of us
 
01:06:06.789 --> 01:06:06.799 align:start position:0%
along the way had a hard Scrabble life
 
01:06:10.269 --> 01:06:10.279 align:start position:0%
but we had a hand up along the way if I
 
01:06:11.910 --> 01:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
know that I consistently hear from many
 
01:06:14.789 --> 01:06:14.799 align:start position:0%
sitting here that education is all about
 
01:06:17.269 --> 01:06:17.279 align:start position:0%
the kids well perhaps this is time to
 
01:06:20.029 --> 01:06:20.039 align:start position:0%
support the kids and if I know that
 
01:06:22.870 --> 01:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
fundament found foundationally the needs

suggestion this amendment makes this

materials in their schools and want
 
01:15:20.709 --> 01:15:20.719 align:start position:0%

State Board of Education to be in a
 
01:15:27.070 --> 01:15:27.080 align:start position:0%
part of the appeal process for a parent

to what we do here
 
01:15:59.669 --> 01:15:59.679 align:start position:0%

approach to tackling OB City within our

school districts have the choice to opt

four-prong approach and appeals process
 
01:17:10.270 --> 01:17:10.280 align:start position:0%
for grieved parents to pursue beginning
 
01:17:11.790 --> 01:17:11.800 align:start position:0%
with the school principal to the

assistant superintendent to the school
 
01:17:16.430 --> 01:17:16.440 align:start position:0%
superintendent and ultimately ending
 
01:17:18.550 --> 01:17:18.560 align:start position:0%
with the local school board being the
 
01:17:20.470 --> 01:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
final Arbiter of the

01:22:46.830 --> 01:22:46.840 align:start position:0%
the State Board of
 
01:22:49.709 --> 01:22:49.719 align:start position:0%

01:23:05.310 --> 01:23:05.320 align:start position:0%
board this bill would also provide civil
 
01:23:09.149 --> 01:23:09.159 align:start position:0%
action by a parent under two conditions
 
01:23:11.629 --> 01:23:11.639 align:start position:0%
one the district did not follow the
 
01:23:15.229 --> 01:23:15.239 align:start position:0%
complaint process or two there was a
 
01:23:17.550 --> 01:23:17.560 align:start position:0%
determination that the material should
 
01:23:20.550 --> 01:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
be moved or removed but the school did
 
01:23:24.070 --> 01:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
not act on it under only those two
 
01:23:27.149 --> 01:23:27.159 align:start position:0%
circumstances is there a civil
 
01:23:29.430 --> 01:23:29.440 align:start position:0%
process and what materials are we
 
01:23:32.510 --> 01:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
talking about we are talking about
 
01:23:35.590 --> 01:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
possibly sexually explicit materials
 
01:23:38.550 --> 01:23:38.560 align:start position:0%
books about suicide about cutting
 
01:23:41.189 --> 01:23:41.199 align:start position:0%

inappropriate to read on the house floor
 
01:35:28.629 --> 01:35:28.639 align:start position:0%

01:35:57.030 --> 01:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
um yeah actually I think that there are
 
01:36:00.990 --> 01:36:01.000 align:start position:0%
a couple of um indications there was um
 
01:36:04.830 --> 01:36:04.840 align:start position:0%
a recent uh youth risk behavior survey
 
01:36:07.669 --> 01:36:07.679 align:start position:0%
and I believe the um some of the results
 
01:36:11.550 --> 01:36:11.560 align:start position:0%
in there uh could be impacted by these
 
01:36:14.510 --> 01:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
materials um one of the questions was
 
01:36:17.030 --> 01:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
the percent of females ever physically
 
01:36:20.750 --> 01:36:20.760 align:start position:0%

it was 19% and Statewide it was
 
01:36:31.070 --> 01:36:31.080 align:start position:0%
14% second question females who have
 
01:36:33.669 --> 01:36:33.679 align:start position:0%
experienced sexual violence during the
 
01:36:38.350 --> 01:36:38.360 align:start position:0%
past year in my area it was 21% and in
 
01:36:40.149 --> 01:36:40.159 align:start position:0%
the state almost
 
01:36:45.430 --> 01:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
18% there was also a recent CDC report
 
01:36:51.030 --> 01:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
that said that between 2017 and 21 teen
 
01:36:53.070 --> 01:36:53.080 align:start position:0%
girl girls who experience sexual
 
01:36:55.350 --> 01:36:55.360 align:start position:0%
violence increased by
 
01:36:59.470 --> 01:36:59.480 align:start position:0%
20% I think that uh perhaps there are a
 
01:37:01.950 --> 01:37:01.960 align:start position:0%
number of factors but could materials
 
01:37:05.790 --> 01:37:05.800 align:start position:0%
such as the be one of them I think so is
 
01:37:08.350 --> 01:37:08.360 align:start position:0%
a member yeld to further questions yes
 
01:37:08.360 --> 01:37:09.830 align:start position:0%
a member yeld to further questions yes
remember

01:37:09.830 --> 01:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
remember
 
01:37:12.990 --> 01:37:13.000 align:start position:0%
Els uh thank you Mr Speaker and thank
 
01:37:16.189 --> 01:37:16.199 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question in the caca I
 
01:37:19.629 --> 01:37:19.639 align:start position:0%
I I may have lost it but in the words uh
 
01:37:22.470 --> 01:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
you were reading I I did you did you
 
01:37:25.750 --> 01:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
also mean to mention the images that are
 
01:37:27.830 --> 01:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
available since a picture is worth a
 
01:37:30.350 --> 01:37:30.360 align:start position:0%
thousand words I understand that there
 
01:37:34.350 --> 01:37:34.360 align:start position:0%
are some very graphic images of of uh
 
01:37:37.470 --> 01:37:37.480 align:start position:0%
sexual performance in these books as
 
01:37:42.430 --> 01:37:42.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:47.030 --> 01:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
not uh yes it is and uh uh on a number
 
01:37:49.109 --> 01:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
of occasions some of those images were
 
01:37:52.270 --> 01:37:52.280 align:start position:0%
passed around in our education committee
 
01:37:54.430 --> 01:37:54.440 align:start position:0%
and we had members of our committee who
 
01:37:57.830 --> 01:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
refused to look at them so you know I uh
 
01:38:00.629 --> 01:38:00.639 align:start position:0%
don't know what happens in schools but
 
01:38:02.910 --> 01:38:02.920 align:start position:0%
uh if our own members won't look at the
 
01:38:06.149 --> 01:38:06.159 align:start position:0%
images uh I fear for our children so
 
01:38:09.149 --> 01:38:09.159 align:start position:0%
member yield to further question
 
01:38:12.229 --> 01:38:12.239 align:start position:0%
yes you may inquire all right I thank
 
01:38:13.830 --> 01:38:13.840 align:start position:0%
the member for taking a question this is
 
01:38:15.629 --> 01:38:15.639 align:start position:0%
maybe a more specific question that he
 
01:38:18.790 --> 01:38:18.800 align:start position:0%
can answer but in the case of um
 
01:38:20.790 --> 01:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
teaching kids foreign languages um
 
01:38:23.149 --> 01:38:23.159 align:start position:0%
particular I'm thinking of Latin um do
 
01:38:26.390 --> 01:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
we are you do you support them being
 
01:38:29.790 --> 01:38:29.800 align:start position:0%
taught to count um above five because I
 
01:38:31.310 --> 01:38:31.320 align:start position:0%
believe any of us who stud in Latin know
 
01:38:33.870 --> 01:38:33.880 align:start position:0%
what the number Latin word for six is so
 
01:38:34.870 --> 01:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
do you
 
01:38:37.270 --> 01:38:37.280 align:start position:0%
support uh only limiting Latin
 
01:38:38.950 --> 01:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
instruction when they teach them about
 
01:38:44.589 --> 01:38:44.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:48.270 --> 01:38:48.280 align:start position:0%
not uh I'm sorry I don't know
 
01:38:50.589 --> 01:38:50.599 align:start position:0%
Latin does a member yeld a further
 
01:38:54.109 --> 01:38:54.119 align:start position:0%
question yes member
 
01:38:56.589 --> 01:38:56.599 align:start position:0%
yields thank you for taking my
 
01:38:59.350 --> 01:38:59.360 align:start position:0%
question are you aware in any of these
 
01:39:01.950 --> 01:39:01.960 align:start position:0%
books that these ebooks that are
 
01:39:04.390 --> 01:39:04.400 align:start position:0%

but I heard that they are available is a
 
01:39:28.830 --> 01:39:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:32.629 --> 01:39:32.639 align:start position:0%

recognized representative Myer for
 
01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:27.070 align:start position:0%
recognized representative Myer for
parliamentary

01:42:27.070 --> 01:42:27.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:29.470 --> 01:42:29.480 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr
 
01:42:32.109 --> 01:42:32.119 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I believe that this is an
 
01:42:34.709 --> 01:42:34.719 align:start position:0%
extreme and controversial
 
01:42:37.629 --> 01:42:37.639 align:start position:0%
bill and if I believe that this bill
 
01:42:40.870 --> 01:42:40.880 align:start position:0%
will ban books and censor material and
 
01:42:43.830 --> 01:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
the availability of controversial
 
01:42:47.109 --> 01:42:47.119 align:start position:0%
material if I believe that an individual
 
01:42:50.310 --> 01:42:50.320 align:start position:0%
parent has a right to select books and
 
01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:51.430 align:start position:0%
parent has a right to select books and
material

01:42:51.430 --> 01:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
material
 
01:42:53.350 --> 01:42:53.360 align:start position:0%
that are appropriate for their
 
01:42:56.910 --> 01:42:56.920 align:start position:0%
children but not but they cannot have
 
01:42:59.709 --> 01:42:59.719 align:start position:0%
that right to make for all
 
01:43:02.310 --> 01:43:02.320 align:start position:0%
parents if I believe that professional
 
01:43:05.149 --> 01:43:05.159 align:start position:0%
teachers and Librarians and others
 
01:43:08.229 --> 01:43:08.239 align:start position:0%
should not be subject to arrest
 
01:43:11.470 --> 01:43:11.480 align:start position:0%
discipline loss of professional license
 
01:43:13.669 --> 01:43:13.679 align:start position:0%
just because they are providing material
 
01:43:16.149 --> 01:43:16.159 align:start position:0%
they feel that is important for students
 
01:43:18.189 --> 01:43:18.199 align:start position:0%
to create critical
 
01:43:20.950 --> 01:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
thinkers and if I believe that this it's
 
01:43:24.310 --> 01:43:24.320 align:start position:0%
the duty of local elected school boards
 
01:43:27.189 --> 01:43:27.199 align:start position:0%
to create the community literacy
 
01:43:29.830 --> 01:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
standard that should be available to
 
01:43:32.470 --> 01:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
students and not have that local
 
01:43:35.629 --> 01:43:35.639 align:start position:0%
judgment challenged and adjudicated by
 
01:43:37.189 --> 01:43:37.199 align:start position:0%
the State Board of
 
01:43:40.669 --> 01:43:40.679 align:start position:0%
Education and finally Mr Speaker if I
 
01:43:44.589 --> 01:43:44.599 align:start position:0%
know that a bipartisan Bill HB
 
01:43:47.510 --> 01:43:47.520 align:start position:0%

01:43:50.310 --> 01:43:50.320 align:start position:0%

01:51:55.950 --> 01:51:55.960 align:start position:0%
proposed placement options this bill
 
01:51:58.310 --> 01:51:58.320 align:start position:0%
requires school districts to develop
 
01:52:01.430 --> 01:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
policies allowing classroom
 
01:52:03.589 --> 01:52:03.599 align:start position:0%
observation but isn't that opportunity
 
01:52:06.390 --> 01:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
already available apparently not
 
01:52:08.510 --> 01:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
everywhere because this bill comes at
 
01:52:11.390 --> 01:52:11.400 align:start position:0%
the request of a constituent of the
 
01:52:14.790 --> 01:52:14.800 align:start position:0%
sponsor during our hearings some object
 
01:52:17.510 --> 01:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
objected to the phrase inside the bill
 
01:52:20.149 --> 01:52:20.159 align:start position:0%
that reads school districts shall impose
 
01:52:23.189 --> 01:52:23.199 align:start position:0%
no conditions or restrictions on such
 
01:52:25.270 --> 01:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
observations and I agree that that
 
01:52:27.069 --> 01:52:27.079 align:start position:0%
sounds overly
 
01:52:29.270 --> 01:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
permissive but it has to be read in
 
01:52:31.310 --> 01:52:31.320 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the rest of the
 
01:52:35.270 --> 01:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
sentence that says except those
 
01:52:37.669 --> 01:52:37.679 align:start position:0%
necessary to ensure the safety of the
 
01:52:40.149 --> 01:52:40.159 align:start position:0%
children in the program to ensure the
 
01:52:42.149 --> 01:52:42.159 align:start position:0%
Integrity of the program while under
 
01:52:44.310 --> 01:52:44.320 align:start position:0%
observation and to protect the
 
01:52:47.229 --> 01:52:47.239 align:start position:0%
confidentiality of those involved in the
 
01:52:49.950 --> 01:52:49.960 align:start position:0%
program this bill recognizes the
 
01:52:52.350 --> 01:52:52.360 align:start position:0%
important role that parents play in
 
01:52:55.390 --> 01:52:55.400 align:start position:0%
special education and allows a parent to
 
01:52:58.310 --> 01:52:58.320 align:start position:0%
observe a program while still guarding
 
01:53:01.390 --> 01:53:01.400 align:start position:0%
the Integrity the safety and the
 
01:53:04.149 --> 01:53:04.159 align:start position:0%
confidentiality of the program I hope
 
01:53:06.189 --> 01:53:06.199 align:start position:0%
you will support extending this

01:55:17.470 --> 01:55:17.480 align:start position:0%
school districts already have policies
 
01:55:20.310 --> 01:55:20.320 align:start position:0%

students including those with special
 
01:55:33.629 --> 01:55:33.639 align:start position:0%

some material oh I'm sorry wrong Pi um
 
01:56:12.910 --> 01:56:12.920 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that HB
 
01:56:16.430 --> 01:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
1525 simply requires a district policy
 
01:56:18.950 --> 01:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
to allow parents to observe their
 
01:56:21.109 --> 01:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
special needs child in the
 
01:56:24.310 --> 01:56:24.320 align:start position:0%
classroom if I know that observations
 
01:56:26.910 --> 01:56:26.920 align:start position:0%
can be restricted by the school to
 
01:56:30.390 --> 01:56:30.400 align:start position:0%
ensure safety program integrity and
 
01:56:32.870 --> 01:56:32.880 align:start position:0%

the
 
01:56:36.270 --> 01:56:36.280 align:start position:0%
classroom and if I know that this just
 
01:56:38.910 --> 01:56:38.920 align:start position:0%
follows the goals of most districts to
 
01:56:41.910 --> 01:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
increase parental engagement and promote
 
01:56:45.709 --> 01:56:45.719 align:start position:0%
transparency would I now press the green
 
01:56:48.589 --> 01:56:48.599 align:start position:0%

afternoon colleagues House Bill 1652
 
01:58:45.270 --> 01:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
enables school districts to create a
 
01:58:48.790 --> 01:58:48.800 align:start position:0%
local taxpayer funded EFA program it
 
01:58:51.030 --> 01:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
would require require increased property
 
01:58:53.870 --> 01:58:53.880 align:start position:0%
taxes to pay for Education outside of
 
01:58:56.629 --> 01:58:56.639 align:start position:0%
local public schools students would be
 
01:58:59.189 --> 01:58:59.199 align:start position:0%
eligible regardless of the family income
 
01:59:03.350 --> 01:59:03.360 align:start position:0%
or capacity to pay make no mistake this
 
01:59:05.790 --> 01:59:05.800 align:start position:0%
is not a cost-saving measure for local
 
01:59:08.550 --> 01:59:08.560 align:start position:0%
school districts but rather it is a
 
01:59:10.510 --> 01:59:10.520 align:start position:0%
subsidy for private and religious
 
01:59:13.109 --> 01:59:13.119 align:start position:0%
education for students of wealthy
 
01:59:15.830 --> 01:59:15.840 align:start position:0%
families and unlike the current EFA
 
01:59:18.069 --> 01:59:18.079 align:start position:0%
program the costs would be borne
 
01:59:20.790 --> 01:59:20.800 align:start position:0%
entirely by local
 
01:59:23.589 --> 01:59:23.599 align:start position:0%
taxpayers as with the existing EFA
 
01:59:26.709 --> 01:59:26.719 align:start position:0%
program there is no accountability for
 
01:59:29.189 --> 01:59:29.199 align:start position:0%
expenditures there are no academic
 
01:59:31.589 --> 01:59:31.599 align:start position:0%
standards for services or materials paid
 
01:59:34.430 --> 01:59:34.440 align:start position:0%
for through the program there are no
 
01:59:36.510 --> 01:59:36.520 align:start position:0%
background checks to assure safety of
 
01:59:39.470 --> 01:59:39.480 align:start position:0%
the children there are no assessments to
 
01:59:42.430 --> 01:59:42.440 align:start position:0%
evaluate the outcomes and there is not
 
01:59:44.830 --> 01:59:44.840 align:start position:0%
even any data collected as to whether
 
01:59:46.990 --> 01:59:47.000 align:start position:0%
students received any educational
 
01:59:49.910 --> 01:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
services at all according to the
 
01:59:52.550 --> 01:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
Department of Education most students
 
01:59:55.189 --> 01:59:55.199 align:start position:0%
receiving state efas were not attending
 
01:59:57.189 --> 01:59:57.199 align:start position:0%
Public Schools when they entered the
 
01:59:59.990 --> 02:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
program we should expect the same if
 
02:00:03.189 --> 02:00:03.199 align:start position:0%
local efas are created public Community
 
02:00:06.270 --> 02:00:06.280 align:start position:0%
School costs will not go
 
02:00:09.870 --> 02:00:09.880 align:start position:0%
down further there is great risk that a
 
02:00:12.669 --> 02:00:12.679 align:start position:0%
small contingent of people motivated to
 
02:00:15.270 --> 02:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
dismantle Public Schools could vote to
 
02:00:18.430 --> 02:00:18.440 align:start position:0%
create local efas in small communities
 
02:00:20.709 --> 02:00:20.719 align:start position:0%
where School meting ings often lack
 
02:00:23.550 --> 02:00:23.560 align:start position:0%
substantial voter participation I'm from
 
02:00:27.149 --> 02:00:27.159 align:start position:0%
cin I know what that looks like the bill
 
02:00:29.149 --> 02:00:29.159 align:start position:0%
states that if a community starts a
 
02:00:32.990 --> 02:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
local EFA even if they later resend the
 
02:00:35.870 --> 02:00:35.880 align:start position:0%
program the students already enrolled
 
02:00:38.350 --> 02:00:38.360 align:start position:0%
must be covered until High School
 
02:00:41.149 --> 02:00:41.159 align:start position:0%
graduation this is an unfunded mandate
 
02:00:44.030 --> 02:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
which we all know is against statute you
 
02:00:46.229 --> 02:00:46.239 align:start position:0%
cannot bind the community to pay for
 
02:00:49.790 --> 02:00:49.800 align:start position:0%
Education grants for 12 years ahead
 
02:00:52.550 --> 02:00:52.560 align:start position:0%

especially in the context of Greater
 
02:01:09.350 --> 02:01:09.360 align:start position:0%

02:01:12.270 --> 02:01:12.280 align:start position:0%
out twice the amount of the state based
 
02:01:15.229 --> 02:01:15.239 align:start position:0%

qualify please join me in the fiscally

02:01:41.149 --> 02:01:41.159 align:start position:0%
enabling
 
02:01:43.870 --> 02:01:43.880 align:start position:0%
legislation this legislation just like
 
02:01:46.030 --> 02:01:46.040 align:start position:0%
the current law to allow a local
 
02:01:48.189 --> 02:01:48.199 align:start position:0%
community to go from traditional town
 
02:01:51.149 --> 02:01:51.159 align:start position:0%
meeting to to the sb2 form of town
 
02:01:53.589 --> 02:01:53.599 align:start position:0%
meeting or back to traditional town
 
02:01:56.030 --> 02:01:56.040 align:start position:0%
meeting it's the same mechanism it
 
02:01:59.910 --> 02:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
requires a 60% vote of the local school
 
02:02:02.870 --> 02:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
district to enable this legislation so
 
02:02:05.069 --> 02:02:05.079 align:start position:0%
it's hard to imagine that some small
 
02:02:07.750 --> 02:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
cabal looking to dismantle public
 
02:02:09.669 --> 02:02:09.679 align:start position:0%
education in New Hampshire and some
 
02:02:13.069 --> 02:02:13.079 align:start position:0%
Community is going to get 60% of the
 
02:02:16.109 --> 02:02:16.119 align:start position:0%
vote this is this is the vote of the
 
02:02:18.629 --> 02:02:18.639 align:start position:0%
people living in in their own District
 
02:02:21.069 --> 02:02:21.079 align:start position:0%
to to have their their voice heard for
 
02:02:23.390 --> 02:02:23.400 align:start position:0%
their own self-determination to decide
 
02:02:27.390 --> 02:02:27.400 align:start position:0%
if they want some some of the local uh
 
02:02:29.990 --> 02:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
education Monies to be able to to follow
 
02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:31.470 align:start position:0%
education Monies to be able to to follow
the

02:02:31.470 --> 02:02:31.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:02:35.270 --> 02:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
child it's easy ballot access requires
 
02:02:38.470 --> 02:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
25 signatures of registered voters from
 
02:02:42.470 --> 02:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
the community so it's it's easy
 
02:02:45.790 --> 02:02:45.800 align:start position:0%
access the question to enable and the
 
02:02:47.950 --> 02:02:47.960 align:start position:0%
question to disable the program in a
 
02:02:50.910 --> 02:02:50.920 align:start position:0%
district is defined in the
 
02:02:53.629 --> 02:02:53.639 align:start position:0%
RSA so there wouldn't be any playing of
 
02:02:55.709 --> 02:02:55.719 align:start position:0%
games with how the question is worded it
 
02:02:57.870 --> 02:02:57.880 align:start position:0%
shall we shall we vote to approve or
 
02:03:03.550 --> 02:03:03.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:07.270 --> 02:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
discontinue let's just pretend for a
 
02:03:12.270 --> 02:03:12.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:15.629 --> 02:03:15.639 align:start position:0%
this what's the uptake
 
02:03:18.229 --> 02:03:18.239 align:start position:0%
rate I think we all have to admit that's
 
02:03:19.629 --> 02:03:19.639 align:start position:0%
the great un
 
02:03:22.069 --> 02:03:22.079 align:start position:0%
known I can only speak for my own
 
02:03:24.350 --> 02:03:24.360 align:start position:0%
Community because that's that's where I
 
02:03:26.149 --> 02:03:26.159 align:start position:0%
have the intimate
 
02:03:28.910 --> 02:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
connection and if Deerfield enabled this
 
02:03:31.790 --> 02:03:31.800 align:start position:0%
program my gut tells me the uptake rate
 
02:03:33.310 --> 02:03:33.320 align:start position:0%
would be very
 
02:03:37.189 --> 02:03:37.199 align:start position:0%
low most people want their children to
 
02:03:40.589 --> 02:03:40.599 align:start position:0%
attend their local public school they
 
02:03:42.589 --> 02:03:42.599 align:start position:0%
want their children to be raised with
 
02:03:46.109 --> 02:03:46.119 align:start position:0%
that sense of community that sense of of
 
02:03:48.310 --> 02:03:48.320 align:start position:0%
neighborhood so that they grow up with
 
02:03:49.709 --> 02:03:49.719 align:start position:0%
the kids around around them and they
 
02:03:51.830 --> 02:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
have a sense of place as they grow up I
 
02:03:53.430 --> 02:03:53.440 align:start position:0%
think we all agree with
 
02:03:56.310 --> 02:03:56.320 align:start position:0%
that your local public school is
 
02:03:59.430 --> 02:03:59.440 align:start position:0%
obligated by state law prek through 8 to
 
02:04:02.390 --> 02:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
provide free transportation to and from
 
02:04:05.510 --> 02:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
school for most families that's a huge
 
02:04:08.470 --> 02:04:08.480 align:start position:0%
carrot it's a huge carrot so if your
 
02:04:11.189 --> 02:04:11.199 align:start position:0%
community enables this program if this
 
02:04:12.790 --> 02:04:12.800 align:start position:0%
when this bill
 
02:04:15.870 --> 02:04:15.880 align:start position:0%
passes then anybody that avails thems of
 
02:04:17.350 --> 02:04:17.360 align:start position:0%
this program they they have to provide
 
02:04:19.229 --> 02:04:19.239 align:start position:0%
their own transportation so it's it's
 
02:04:20.629 --> 02:04:20.639 align:start position:0%
it's not a free
 
02:04:23.830 --> 02:04:23.840 align:start position:0%
lunch the the only districts that would
 
02:04:26.030 --> 02:04:26.040 align:start position:0%
have to to be a little bit nervous if
 
02:04:27.629 --> 02:04:27.639 align:start position:0%
this was
 
02:04:31.270 --> 02:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
enabled is if they have what the people
 
02:04:34.149 --> 02:04:34.159 align:start position:0%
in the district would deem a failing
 
02:04:37.030 --> 02:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
public school it's not my opinion my
 
02:04:38.669 --> 02:04:38.679 align:start position:0%
opinion on the quality of their public
 
02:04:41.189 --> 02:04:41.199 align:start position:0%
schools has no bearing on this right
 
02:04:44.109 --> 02:04:44.119 align:start position:0%
it's it's the local community and if a
 
02:04:46.510 --> 02:04:46.520 align:start position:0%
school district enables this and all of
 
02:04:48.790 --> 02:04:48.800 align:start position:0%
a sudden kids are fleeing their local
 
02:04:51.069 --> 02:04:51.079 align:start position:0%
District doesn't that tell the Local
 
02:04:53.830 --> 02:04:53.840 align:start position:0%
District isn't that a positive feedback
 
02:04:55.990 --> 02:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
loop that they are not providing the
 
02:04:58.709 --> 02:04:58.719 align:start position:0%
goods and services that the children and
 
02:05:00.790 --> 02:05:00.800 align:start position:0%
the families of that District want and
 
02:05:02.910 --> 02:05:02.920 align:start position:0%
that is that is a feedback loop to
 
02:05:05.629 --> 02:05:05.639 align:start position:0%
improve public
 
02:05:08.629 --> 02:05:08.639 align:start position:0%
education we hear about private schools
 
02:05:10.870 --> 02:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
and parochial
 
02:05:13.390 --> 02:05:13.400 align:start position:0%
schools well there's nothing that would
 
02:05:16.669 --> 02:05:16.679 align:start position:0%
stop a family from taking this EFA Grant
 
02:05:19.310 --> 02:05:19.320 align:start position:0%
and applying it to another public school
 
02:05:22.390 --> 02:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
you know it you know it's state law that
 
02:05:25.350 --> 02:05:25.360 align:start position:0%
local public schools can tuition in
 
02:05:27.830 --> 02:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
students from other districts if they if
 
02:05:31.390 --> 02:05:31.400 align:start position:0%
they so choose right and so most school
 
02:05:33.830 --> 02:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
districts in this state uh have a long
 
02:05:37.270 --> 02:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
run decades run of declining student
 
02:05:40.069 --> 02:05:40.079 align:start position:0%
population so so maybe this would be a
 
02:05:42.149 --> 02:05:42.159 align:start position:0%
good way for schools to attract more
 
02:05:44.549 --> 02:05:44.559 align:start position:0%
students to buoy their local public
 
02:05:47.149 --> 02:05:47.159 align:start position:0%
school system right it's not all doom
 
02:05:50.069 --> 02:05:50.079 align:start position:0%
and gloom let's let's not let's not say
 
02:05:52.830 --> 02:05:52.840 align:start position:0%
that yeah it's it's double State
 
02:05:55.549 --> 02:05:55.559 align:start position:0%
adequacy it's double state adequacy in
 
02:05:58.310 --> 02:05:58.320 align:start position:0%
this bill if you enable it a child that
 
02:06:01.589 --> 02:06:01.599 align:start position:0%
takes a local EFA is counted towards the
 
02:06:03.950 --> 02:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
average daily attendance that I'm sorry
 
02:06:06.310 --> 02:06:06.320 align:start position:0%
average daily membership of the school
 
02:06:08.310 --> 02:06:08.320 align:start position:0%
so they are still considered a member of
 
02:06:10.310 --> 02:06:10.320 align:start position:0%
that local public school district so the
 
02:06:12.750 --> 02:06:12.760 align:start position:0%
state adequacy flows to the district and
 
02:06:15.189 --> 02:06:15.199 align:start position:0%
then flows to the child flows to the
 
02:06:17.990 --> 02:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
student and then the Local District only
 
02:06:20.709 --> 02:06:20.719 align:start position:0%
has to m that amount the vast majority
 
02:06:22.870 --> 02:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
of our school
 
02:06:26.549 --> 02:06:26.559 align:start position:0%
districts spend more than twice State
 
02:06:29.390 --> 02:06:29.400 align:start position:0%
adequacy on to educate students today in
 
02:06:31.950 --> 02:06:31.960 align:start position:0%
their districts that means that there is
 
02:06:35.149 --> 02:06:35.159 align:start position:0%
a a reserve of Revenue that still stays
 
02:06:37.910 --> 02:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
in the local school you know it's funny
 
02:06:39.510 --> 02:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
right when when somebody says a kid's
 
02:06:42.030 --> 02:06:42.040 align:start position:0%
going to leave a public school is 100%
 
02:06:43.950 --> 02:06:43.960 align:start position:0%
fixed cost oh my God if a kid leaves the
 
02:06:45.790 --> 02:06:45.800 align:start position:0%
funding unit goes and and we can't we
 
02:06:48.189 --> 02:06:48.199 align:start position:0%
can't make ends meet but yet when a kid
 
02:06:50.189 --> 02:06:50.199 align:start position:0%
shows is up it's all variable cost well
 
02:06:51.629 --> 02:06:51.639 align:start position:0%
we didn't plan for that extra kid it's
 
02:06:53.549 --> 02:06:53.559 align:start position:0%
going to cost all this extra money well
 
02:06:55.510 --> 02:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
it can't be both ways and it's not both
 
02:06:57.669 --> 02:06:57.679 align:start position:0%
ways it's in the middle and honestly it
 
02:06:59.470 --> 02:06:59.480 align:start position:0%
depends on the school district it
 
02:07:01.549 --> 02:07:01.559 align:start position:0%
depends on the the finances of the
 
02:07:04.069 --> 02:07:04.079 align:start position:0%
school district and this bill allows the
 
02:07:06.750 --> 02:07:06.760 align:start position:0%
local uh citizens of the school district
 
02:07:10.790 --> 02:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
to make this decision for them yeah yeah
 
02:07:13.589 --> 02:07:13.599 align:start position:0%
if you enable it and a kid participates
 
02:07:16.589 --> 02:07:16.599 align:start position:0%
they're grandfathered in you have to
 
02:07:19.430 --> 02:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
have a safety net for families
 
02:07:21.910 --> 02:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
so you're going to enable this as a
 
02:07:24.910 --> 02:07:24.920 align:start position:0%
program runs for a year two years 5
 
02:07:27.830 --> 02:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
years 10 years and it gets disabled for
 
02:07:29.709 --> 02:07:29.719 align:start position:0%
whatever reason right whatever the
 
02:07:32.270 --> 02:07:32.280 align:start position:0%
community decides well we don't want
 
02:07:34.589 --> 02:07:34.599 align:start position:0%
shifting Sands under our students right
 
02:07:36.990 --> 02:07:37.000 align:start position:0%
we all agree we want a measure of
 
02:07:39.990 --> 02:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
consistency in in children's education
 
02:07:42.709 --> 02:07:42.719 align:start position:0%
and so this is a safety net for families
 
02:07:45.549 --> 02:07:45.559 align:start position:0%
that in good faith choose to participate
 
02:07:49.229 --> 02:07:49.239 align:start position:0%
if if if a school district choos
 
02:07:52.310 --> 02:07:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh to make this make this
 
02:07:54.830 --> 02:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
possible surprised we haven't we haven't
 
02:07:58.109 --> 02:07:58.119 align:start position:0%
heard cries about special
 
02:08:00.990 --> 02:08:01.000 align:start position:0%
ed another beauty of this
 
02:08:04.549 --> 02:08:04.559 align:start position:0%
bill is that if the student qualifies
 
02:08:06.310 --> 02:08:06.320 align:start position:0%
for special ed
 
02:08:09.589 --> 02:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
services it grants unilateral authority
 
02:08:12.910 --> 02:08:12.920 align:start position:0%
to the local school district to decide
 
02:08:15.990 --> 02:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
where and when specialed services will
 
02:08:18.750 --> 02:08:18.760 align:start position:0%
be delivered so in other words if
 
02:08:21.069 --> 02:08:21.079 align:start position:0%
Deerfield enabled this and I took my
 
02:08:23.470 --> 02:08:23.480 align:start position:0%
child out of the public school and went
 
02:08:25.910 --> 02:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
somewhere else I can't tell the local
 
02:08:27.470 --> 02:08:27.480 align:start position:0%
school district by the way I want the
 
02:08:29.750 --> 02:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
speech pathologist uh down at the new
 
02:08:32.229 --> 02:08:32.239 align:start position:0%
school in Manchester on Tuesday at 9: I
 
02:08:33.830 --> 02:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
can't do that the school district can
 
02:08:36.109 --> 02:08:36.119 align:start position:0%
tell me the speech pathologist will be
 
02:08:38.390 --> 02:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
available Tuesdays at 9: in the local
 
02:08:42.629 --> 02:08:42.639 align:start position:0%
school right so it it adds fairness for
 
02:08:44.629 --> 02:08:44.639 align:start position:0%
everybody and it doesn't change it
 
02:08:46.750 --> 02:08:46.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't alter any of the special ed
 
02:08:48.990 --> 02:08:49.000 align:start position:0%
costs think about that doesn't change
 
02:08:50.669 --> 02:08:50.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't alter any of the special ed
 
02:08:53.589 --> 02:08:53.599 align:start position:0%
costs by enabling or not enabling this
 
02:08:53.599 --> 02:08:56.430 align:start position:0%
costs by enabling or not enabling this
this

02:08:56.430 --> 02:08:56.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:00.910 --> 02:09:00.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:04.709 --> 02:09:04.719 align:start position:0%
people we do not means test public
 
02:09:06.589 --> 02:09:06.599 align:start position:0%
education in New
 
02:09:09.069 --> 02:09:09.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire when my children became of
 
02:09:10.830 --> 02:09:10.840 align:start position:0%
school age and I brought them to the
 
02:09:12.950 --> 02:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
Deerfield community school that's our
 
02:09:15.149 --> 02:09:15.159 align:start position:0%
local public school they didn't say well
 
02:09:16.870 --> 02:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
excuse me Mr veral how much do you make
 
02:09:20.030 --> 02:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
a year well you qualify for English
 
02:09:23.830 --> 02:09:23.840 align:start position:0%
mathematics and science um art music gym
 
02:09:26.229 --> 02:09:26.239 align:start position:0%
history etc etc etc uh that's going to
 
02:09:27.669 --> 02:09:27.679 align:start position:0%
be a little extra because you know
 
02:09:29.109 --> 02:09:29.119 align:start position:0%
you're you're rich and we don't want to
 
02:09:32.149 --> 02:09:32.159 align:start position:0%
subsidize the education of your children
 
02:09:32.159 --> 02:09:33.470 align:start position:0%
subsidize the education of your children
public

02:09:33.470 --> 02:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
public
 
02:09:36.189 --> 02:09:36.199 align:start position:0%
education is paying for the education of
 
02:09:38.950 --> 02:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
children of a community using public
 
02:09:41.390 --> 02:09:41.400 align:start position:0%
dollars some people think that public
 
02:09:44.189 --> 02:09:44.199 align:start position:0%
education is a public school they think
 
02:09:46.870 --> 02:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
it's a building but it's not it's paying
 
02:09:49.510 --> 02:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
for the education of our children using
 
02:09:53.350 --> 02:09:53.360 align:start position:0%
public monies and this bill um stands
 
02:09:56.270 --> 02:09:56.280 align:start position:0%
that stands that test the rich already
 
02:09:56.280 --> 02:09:57.669 align:start position:0%
that stands that test the rich already
have

02:09:57.669 --> 02:09:57.679 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:09:59.830 --> 02:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
options State
 
02:10:03.270 --> 02:10:03.280 align:start position:0%
FAS they go a long ways it's I don't
 
02:10:05.910 --> 02:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
know where's where's representative 4500
 
02:10:07.750 --> 02:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
a year State adequacy somewhere around
 
02:10:10.589 --> 02:10:10.599 align:start position:0%
there right now right and that helps a
 
02:10:13.229 --> 02:10:13.239 align:start position:0%
lot of families that otherwise couldn't
 
02:10:15.750 --> 02:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
afford another option this doubles that
 
02:10:18.870 --> 02:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
amount it doubles state adequacy that
 
02:10:22.709 --> 02:10:22.719 align:start position:0%
puts a huge spectrum of educational
 
02:10:25.589 --> 02:10:25.599 align:start position:0%
possibilities Within Reach of even the
 
02:10:29.350 --> 02:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
most financially struggling families in
 
02:10:31.589 --> 02:10:31.599 align:start position:0%
the state the rich can already afford to
 
02:10:34.709 --> 02:10:34.719 align:start position:0%
send their kids to private school okay
 
02:10:36.830 --> 02:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
it's the Working Poor it's the lower
 
02:10:39.109 --> 02:10:39.119 align:start position:0%
middle class those are the people that
 
02:10:41.790 --> 02:10:41.800 align:start position:0%
can't afford it and and if we if we say
 
02:10:43.950 --> 02:10:43.960 align:start position:0%
adequacies $4,500 we're talking about
 
02:10:46.629 --> 02:10:46.639 align:start position:0%
nine grand a year per student that is
 
02:10:48.470 --> 02:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
more than enough to allow the V V
 
02:10:51.149 --> 02:10:51.159 align:start position:0%
majority of families uh wide openen
 
02:10:52.870 --> 02:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
educational opportunities that's a
 
02:10:55.430 --> 02:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
win-win that's a win for taxpayers
 
02:10:57.430 --> 02:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
that's a win for for parents that's a
 
02:11:06.350 --> 02:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:10.109 --> 02:11:10.119 align:start position:0%
thing the other thing I'll I'll
 
02:11:13.350 --> 02:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
say is we hear there's no accountability
 
02:11:15.870 --> 02:11:15.880 align:start position:0%
fiscally right but there's no lawsuit
 
02:11:18.270 --> 02:11:18.280 align:start position:0%
saying that there's fraud on State efas
 
02:11:20.430 --> 02:11:20.440 align:start position:0%
and the local EFA follows the same
 
02:11:23.669 --> 02:11:23.679 align:start position:0%
system so the system seems to be working
 
02:11:25.069 --> 02:11:25.079 align:start position:0%
at the state level because there's no
 
02:11:26.950 --> 02:11:26.960 align:start position:0%
court cases bringing it down with all
 
02:11:29.270 --> 02:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
this fraud so that's an accusation
 
02:11:31.589 --> 02:11:31.599 align:start position:0%
without any supporting evidence uh that
 
02:11:34.669 --> 02:11:34.679 align:start position:0%
I'm aware of so let's not worry about
 
02:11:37.870 --> 02:11:37.880 align:start position:0%
that and as for academic accountability
 
02:11:40.870 --> 02:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
I was a little surprised by that perhaps
 
02:11:43.189 --> 02:11:43.199 align:start position:0%
the the member of the education
 
02:11:45.549 --> 02:11:45.559 align:start position:0%
committee chose not to read the
 
02:11:49.510 --> 02:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
bill section 10 part three lowercase D
 
02:11:52.549 --> 02:11:52.559 align:start position:0%
number three to provide an annual record
 
02:11:54.030 --> 02:11:54.040 align:start position:0%
of Education
 
02:11:56.750 --> 02:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
attainment by the students they will
 
02:11:59.270 --> 02:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
take the Statewide student assessment
 
02:12:02.629 --> 02:12:02.639 align:start position:0%
test any child that participates in a
 
02:12:05.229 --> 02:12:05.239 align:start position:0%
local EFA if it's enabled takes the
 
02:12:07.669 --> 02:12:07.679 align:start position:0%
Statewide assessment test imagine that
 
02:12:09.549 --> 02:12:09.559 align:start position:0%
we'd finally get that data set they've
 
02:12:11.950 --> 02:12:11.960 align:start position:0%
been asking for they want to they want
 
02:12:13.990 --> 02:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
to know how are kids at private schools
 
02:12:16.069 --> 02:12:16.079 align:start position:0%
religious schools other schools doing
 
02:12:18.549 --> 02:12:18.559 align:start position:0%
this would give us that because kids
 
02:12:20.310 --> 02:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
that part choose to participate have to
 
02:12:22.109 --> 02:12:22.119 align:start position:0%
take the Statewide assessment we'd
 
02:12:24.030 --> 02:12:24.040 align:start position:0%
finally get that data if for no other
 
02:12:25.870 --> 02:12:25.880 align:start position:0%
reason I would vote for this bill just
 
02:12:29.030 --> 02:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
to get that that set of
 
02:12:34.149 --> 02:12:34.159 align:start position:0%
data this is a great bill it splits very
 
02:12:36.990 --> 02:12:37.000 align:start position:0%
carefully responsibility and fairness to
 
02:12:40.189 --> 02:12:40.199 align:start position:0%
school districts as well as to parents
 
02:12:43.390 --> 02:12:43.400 align:start position:0%
and students as well as
 
02:12:46.189 --> 02:12:46.199 align:start position:0%
taxpayers if it's a runaway fiscal train
 
02:12:48.390 --> 02:12:48.400 align:start position:0%
it won't be but if it is then the
 
02:12:51.430 --> 02:12:51.440 align:start position:0%

House Bill
 
02:14:34.750 --> 02:14:34.760 align:start position:0%
1652 this is a division
 
02:14:37.069 --> 02:14:37.079 align:start position:0%
vote chair recognized representative
 
02:14:41.149 --> 02:14:41.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:44.790 --> 02:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you very much Mr
 
02:14:47.950 --> 02:14:47.960 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know the EFA program isn't
 
02:14:50.669 --> 02:14:50.679 align:start position:0%
about kids leaving Public Schools but
 
02:14:53.430 --> 02:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
it's about the state using the state
 
02:14:55.990 --> 02:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
budget to pay tuition costs for kids
 
02:14:57.790 --> 02:14:57.800 align:start position:0%
already into private and religious
 
02:15:00.069 --> 02:15:00.079 align:start position:0%
schools and are way over budget today
 
02:15:02.470 --> 02:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
because of it and if I know local
 
02:15:05.270 --> 02:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
property taxes should not have to open
 
02:15:08.069 --> 02:15:08.079 align:start position:0%
up their checkbooks too to pay for these
 
02:15:10.669 --> 02:15:10.679 align:start position:0%
private school tuition costs and that
 
02:15:12.790 --> 02:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
property taxpayers shouldn't have to
 
02:15:15.229 --> 02:15:15.239 align:start position:0%
face these challenges and petitions
 
02:15:18.189 --> 02:15:18.199 align:start position:0%
every year then would I press the red
 
02:15:20.510 --> 02:15:20.520 align:start position:0%
button to defeat this motion so that
 
02:15:22.790 --> 02:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
another motion be could be made and put
 
02:15:24.750 --> 02:15:24.760 align:start position:0%

02:15:30.910 --> 02:15:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:34.310 --> 02:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr
 
02:15:36.870 --> 02:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know this bill allows the
 
02:15:38.830 --> 02:15:38.840 align:start position:0%
school district to establish a local
 
02:15:41.549 --> 02:15:41.559 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account program for
 
02:15:44.950 --> 02:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
eligible resident students and if I know
 
02:15:48.069 --> 02:15:48.079 align:start position:0%
this enabling legislation requiring a
 
02:15:51.549 --> 02:15:51.559 align:start position:0%
60% super majority vote of District
 
02:15:54.549 --> 02:15:54.559 align:start position:0%
voters that can also be rescinded by a
 
02:15:57.910 --> 02:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
similar action at any time and if I
 
02:16:00.189 --> 02:16:00.199 align:start position:0%
believe Educational Opportunity provided
 
02:16:02.830 --> 02:16:02.840 align:start position:0%
by local education Freedom accounts will
 
02:16:05.109 --> 02:16:05.119 align:start position:0%
give parents the power to choose the
 
02:16:08.189 --> 02:16:08.199 align:start position:0%
educational options that best fit their
 
02:16:11.069 --> 02:16:11.079 align:start position:0%
children through public dollars
 
02:16:12.390 --> 02:16:12.400 align:start position:0%
following the
 
02:16:14.669 --> 02:16:14.679 align:start position:0%
child would I then press the green
 
02:16:16.750 --> 02:16:16.760 align:start position:0%

02:16:19.669 --> 02:16:19.679 align:start position:0%
choice and this wonderful option that
 
02:16:22.030 --> 02:16:22.040 align:start position:0%

02:25:14.269 --> 02:25:14.279 align:start position:0%
economic resources and higher numbers of
 
02:25:17.590 --> 02:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
reduced and free lunch students these
 
02:25:20.070 --> 02:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
are areas where F many families could
 
02:25:23.110 --> 02:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
already apply based on income if they
 
02:25:26.630 --> 02:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
wanted to there is no data to indicate
 
02:25:28.870 --> 02:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
that children with education Freedom
 
02:25:31.510 --> 02:25:31.520 align:start position:0%

standardized assessments compared with
 
02:25:36.830 --> 02:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
students in public schools in fact most
 
02:25:38.630 --> 02:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
of those receiving vouchers are not
 
02:25:41.389 --> 02:25:41.399 align:start position:0%
required to do or take the same
 
02:25:44.710 --> 02:25:44.720 align:start position:0%
assessment as the public school students
 
02:25:48.230 --> 02:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
75% of EFA students have never attended
 
02:25:50.910 --> 02:25:50.920 align:start position:0%
public school and homeschooled students
 
02:25:52.870 --> 02:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
are not required to take
 
02:25:55.110 --> 02:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
assessments public school students take
 
02:25:57.510 --> 02:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
a test for English language arts and
 
02:26:00.910 --> 02:26:00.920 align:start position:0%
Mathematics in grades 38 and SATs in
 
02:26:03.750 --> 02:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
grade 11 science is only measured in
 
02:26:08.110 --> 02:26:08.120 align:start position:0%
grade 5 8 and 11 these are one-day tests
 
02:26:11.469 --> 02:26:11.479 align:start position:0%
given that give a limited snapshot into
 
02:26:14.790 --> 02:26:14.800 align:start position:0%
the ability and the achievement of
 
02:26:17.269 --> 02:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
students these test scores are not a
 
02:26:19.670 --> 02:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
true measure of the student or the
 
02:26:19.680 --> 02:26:20.670 align:start position:0%
true measure of the student or the
school's

school's
 
02:26:24.389 --> 02:26:24.399 align:start position:0%
success proficiency is a moving
 
02:26:27.590 --> 02:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
Target in I was asked or I asked the
 
02:26:30.150 --> 02:26:30.160 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this bill what proficiency
 
02:26:32.030 --> 02:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
would mean in terms of you know old
 
02:26:35.550 --> 02:26:35.560 align:start position:0%
school like when I went to school ABC D
 
02:26:38.710 --> 02:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
and no one seems to know or what's the
 
02:26:41.030 --> 02:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
standard just below proficiency is it
 
02:26:45.790 --> 02:26:45.800 align:start position:0%
basic intermediate nobody seems to know
 
02:26:49.389 --> 02:26:49.399 align:start position:0%
1677 allows a family who merely lives in

scores in any subject assessments that
 
02:27:01.190 --> 02:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
are only given potentially three times
 
02:27:04.630 --> 02:27:04.640 align:start position:0%
in a school students career those
 
02:27:06.469 --> 02:27:06.479 align:start position:0%
students do not have to be in public
 
02:27:09.510 --> 02:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
school or charter school or have an
 
02:27:12.389 --> 02:27:12.399 align:start position:0%

access to the
 
02:27:17.150 --> 02:27:17.160 align:start position:0%
EA they simply need to reside in that
 
02:27:19.950 --> 02:27:19.960 align:start position:0%
geographic area at that one moment of
 
02:27:22.710 --> 02:27:22.720 align:start position:0%
time to get the yearly money for the
 
02:27:25.190 --> 02:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
rest of their child's education from
 
02:27:27.550 --> 02:27:27.560 align:start position:0%
kindergarten to age
 
02:27:30.830 --> 02:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
22 without an income criteria the
 
02:27:32.790 --> 02:27:32.800 align:start position:0%
families who have already chosen private
 
02:27:35.150 --> 02:27:35.160 align:start position:0%
religious or homeschool options based
 
02:27:38.230 --> 02:27:38.240 align:start position:0%
solely on concerns about academic scores
 
02:27:40.349 --> 02:27:40.359 align:start position:0%
have already found a way to afford those
 
02:27:42.710 --> 02:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
options but under this program they
 
02:27:44.950 --> 02:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
would now be able to access taxpayer
 
02:27:47.110 --> 02:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
resourced money to add to their
 
02:27:49.830 --> 02:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
household income to offset the tuition
 
02:27:52.349 --> 02:27:52.359 align:start position:0%
and homeschool materials costs they
 
02:27:55.269 --> 02:27:55.279 align:start position:0%
already can afford the cost of this
 
02:27:57.030 --> 02:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
program for the current year is
 
02:27:59.990 --> 02:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
estimated at about $60 million money
 
02:28:02.670 --> 02:28:02.680 align:start position:0%
coming from the educational trust fund
 
02:28:05.469 --> 02:28:05.479 align:start position:0%
without a cap on this program's funding
 
02:28:07.389 --> 02:28:07.399 align:start position:0%
who knows what state funds will be
 
02:28:11.030 --> 02:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
needed uh to be raised in the future we
 
02:28:13.429 --> 02:28:13.439 align:start position:0%
continually see bills like this that
 
02:28:15.429 --> 02:28:15.439 align:start position:0%
imply that our New Hampshire schools are
 
02:28:17.630 --> 02:28:17.640 align:start position:0%
failing you heard heard this morning
 
02:28:20.550 --> 02:28:20.560 align:start position:0%
they're amazing and they're not failing
 
02:28:24.269 --> 02:28:24.279 align:start position:0%
we know that 165,000 students and their
 
02:28:26.389 --> 02:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
parents actively choose their
 
02:28:28.429 --> 02:28:28.439 align:start position:0%
neighborhood Public Schools where
 
02:28:30.469 --> 02:28:30.479 align:start position:0%
children go to school with their friends
 
02:28:32.349 --> 02:28:32.359 align:start position:0%
and neighbors where they have
 
02:28:34.550 --> 02:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
professionally licensed teachers who are
 
02:28:37.150 --> 02:28:37.160 align:start position:0%

learning academics and meeting the
 
02:28:42.070 --> 02:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
challenges of life for the future the
 
02:28:44.950 --> 02:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
EFA program is using money that could be
 
02:28:47.630 --> 02:28:47.640 align:start position:0%
used for our Public Schools in areas
 
02:28:50.110 --> 02:28:50.120 align:start position:0%
like building aid for schools where
 
02:28:53.389 --> 02:28:53.399 align:start position:0%
which are some a 100 years old money
 
02:28:54.950 --> 02:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
that could be spent to lower the burden
 
02:28:57.349 --> 02:28:57.359 align:start position:0%
of retirement fund cost to schools and
 
02:29:00.590 --> 02:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
taxpayers money to give more services
 
02:29:02.710 --> 02:29:02.720 align:start position:0%

lunches and breakfasts for Hungry kids
 
02:29:12.309 --> 02:29:12.319 align:start position:0%
Public Schools should be spent for the
 
02:29:14.870 --> 02:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
public good for the cherishing of public
 
02:29:17.349 --> 02:29:17.359 align:start position:0%

Constitution without an income
 
02:29:21.070 --> 02:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
requirement the state will be

subsidizing those already in exclusive

private schools this new category opens
 
02:29:28.469 --> 02:29:28.479 align:start position:0%
up an opportunity and will allow the
 
02:29:30.870 --> 02:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
ultra wealthy in our state who do not
 
02:29:33.590 --> 02:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
need the state's help to send their kids
 
02:29:36.309 --> 02:29:36.319 align:start position:0%
to these schools while doing nothing for
 
02:29:37.830 --> 02:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
our struggling neighborhood public
 
02:29:40.630 --> 02:29:40.640 align:start position:0%
schools in places like Berlin Claremont
 
02:29:44.070 --> 02:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
Franklin and elsewhere around the state
 
02:29:46.190 --> 02:29:46.200 align:start position:0%
we need to get more accountability in
 
02:29:48.590 --> 02:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
finan Financial guard rails expenditure
 
02:29:50.790 --> 02:29:50.800 align:start position:0%
caps on EFA
 
02:29:53.429 --> 02:29:53.439 align:start position:0%
program that on the EFA program that
 
02:29:55.750 --> 02:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
already exists and support our Public
 
02:29:58.389 --> 02:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
Schools before we accept these ideas on
 
02:29:59.790 --> 02:29:59.800 align:start position:0%
how to expand
 
02:30:01.990 --> 02:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
eligibility the result of all these
 
02:30:04.910 --> 02:30:04.920 align:start position:0%
proposed eligibility categories is to
 
02:30:08.190 --> 02:30:08.200 align:start position:0%
expand the education Freedom account to
 
02:30:10.950 --> 02:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
a financially unchecked Universal
 
02:30:13.590 --> 02:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
program that will become a very costly
 
02:30:16.630 --> 02:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
State obligation and an equally costly
 
02:30:20.150 --> 02:30:20.160 align:start position:0%
burden for the 165,000 public school
 
02:30:22.670 --> 02:30:22.680 align:start position:0%
students their parents and the local
 
02:30:25.349 --> 02:30:25.359 align:start position:0%
taxpayers I urge you to vote no on this
 
02:30:28.429 --> 02:30:28.439 align:start position:0%
bill so another motion may be made thank
 
02:30:30.429 --> 02:30:30.439 align:start position:0%
you Mr
 
02:30:32.910 --> 02:30:32.920 align:start position:0%
Speaker representative H is recognized
 
02:30:42.590 --> 02:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:44.790 --> 02:30:44.800 align:start position:0%
motion thank you Mr
 
02:30:48.230 --> 02:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
Speaker the bill before for us is known
 
02:30:50.710 --> 02:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
as the every student learns
 
02:30:53.269 --> 02:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
act L's education achievement in
 
02:30:55.950 --> 02:30:55.960 align:start position:0%
reforming neglectful schools that might
 
02:30:55.960 --> 02:30:56.830 align:start position:0%
reforming neglectful schools that might
be

02:30:56.830 --> 02:30:56.840 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:30:58.990 --> 02:30:59.000 align:start position:0%
harsh but if you look at what our
 
02:31:00.389 --> 02:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
schools are doing in terms of
 
02:31:03.389 --> 02:31:03.399 align:start position:0%
performance we're not delivering a
 
02:31:03.399 --> 02:31:05.550 align:start position:0%
performance we're not delivering a
quality

02:31:05.550 --> 02:31:05.560 align:start position:0%
quality
 
02:31:07.710 --> 02:31:07.720 align:start position:0%
education the the prior speaker
 
02:31:09.750 --> 02:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned this is only about wealthy
 
02:31:11.110 --> 02:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
towns they are delivering they're
 
02:31:13.630 --> 02:31:13.640 align:start position:0%
delivering education
 
02:31:16.429 --> 02:31:16.439 align:start position:0%
fine and it's only the the moderate low
 
02:31:18.870 --> 02:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
inome towns that have
 
02:31:21.230 --> 02:31:21.240 align:start position:0%
issues the find member from the corner
 
02:31:23.349 --> 02:31:23.359 align:start position:0%
office um our distinguished Governor his
 
02:31:25.150 --> 02:31:25.160 align:start position:0%
Excellency comes from the town of
 
02:31:27.230 --> 02:31:27.240 align:start position:0%
newfields and I just looked it up and
 
02:31:30.030 --> 02:31:30.040 align:start position:0%
only 40% of the students in that
 
02:31:32.870 --> 02:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
town and I say that again 40% are
 
02:31:35.429 --> 02:31:35.439 align:start position:0%
proficient in science that's just one of
 
02:31:37.750 --> 02:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
many towns I could go through the entire
 
02:31:39.469 --> 02:31:39.479 align:start position:0%
State town by
 
02:31:41.710 --> 02:31:41.720 align:start position:0%
town I point out some of these in an
 
02:31:43.429 --> 02:31:43.439 align:start position:0%
article this morning in the con sorry in
 
02:31:44.870 --> 02:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
the union
 
02:31:47.269 --> 02:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
leader I point out out the largest
 
02:31:48.870 --> 02:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
District in the the largest school
 
02:31:51.190 --> 02:31:51.200 align:start position:0%
district in the town or in the state is
 
02:31:54.429 --> 02:31:54.439 align:start position:0%
the town of Manchester or the city of
 
02:31:57.590 --> 02:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
Manchester and and every subject less
 
02:32:00.269 --> 02:32:00.279 align:start position:0%
than one in three is performing
 
02:32:03.030 --> 02:32:03.040 align:start position:0%
adequately or is proficient by the time
 
02:32:03.040 --> 02:32:03.750 align:start position:0%
adequately or is proficient by the time
they

02:32:03.750 --> 02:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:32:05.990 --> 02:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
graduate how can we defend spending
 
02:32:09.630 --> 02:32:09.640 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money for that level of quality
 
02:32:11.870 --> 02:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
if one out of four students is getting
 
02:32:13.830 --> 02:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
an education the other three aren't
 
02:32:19.070 --> 02:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:21.389 --> 02:32:21.399 align:start position:0%
Life the education committee heard this
 
02:32:22.830 --> 02:32:22.840 align:start position:0%
and they wanted to try and modify it a
 
02:32:23.910 --> 02:32:23.920 align:start position:0%
little bit to see if they could get it
 
02:32:25.790 --> 02:32:25.800 align:start position:0%
passed through that other body but this
 
02:32:27.990 --> 02:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
body should determine the policy and if
 
02:32:29.429 --> 02:32:29.439 align:start position:0%
the other body wants to pick it up
 
02:32:29.439 --> 02:32:30.190 align:start position:0%
the other body wants to pick it up
that's

02:32:30.190 --> 02:32:30.200 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:32:33.030 --> 02:32:33.040 align:start position:0%
great the bill has a fiscal note the
 
02:32:34.590 --> 02:32:34.600 align:start position:0%
fiscal note at the time of printing of
 
02:32:36.750 --> 02:32:36.760 align:start position:0%
the bill was UN right was undetermined
 
02:32:38.750 --> 02:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
it is still undetermined in the latest
 
02:32:40.870 --> 02:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal note I've seen online this will
 
02:32:43.269 --> 02:32:43.279 align:start position:0%
be going in to the fiscal committee for
 
02:32:45.309 --> 02:32:45.319 align:start position:0%
further analysis if passed out of this
 
02:32:45.319 --> 02:32:48.269 align:start position:0%
further analysis if passed out of this
chamber

02:32:48.269 --> 02:32:48.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:51.910 --> 02:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
this is not just about lowincome
 
02:32:53.710 --> 02:32:53.720 align:start position:0%
districts in the
 
02:32:56.870 --> 02:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
state there are those that but Hudson
 
02:32:59.349 --> 02:32:59.359 align:start position:0%
isn't in that list Hudson isn't making
 
02:33:03.349 --> 02:33:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:05.630 --> 02:33:05.640 align:start position:0%
performing this isn't about whether it's
 
02:33:07.990 --> 02:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
a minority District or single- income
 
02:33:10.150 --> 02:33:10.160 align:start position:0%
moms or single- income
 
02:33:12.510 --> 02:33:12.520 align:start position:0%
dads this is about giving our children
 
02:33:13.950 --> 02:33:13.960 align:start position:0%
the best possible
 
02:33:18.590 --> 02:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
education so that they can SU succeed in
 
02:33:20.750 --> 02:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
life in the
 
02:33:23.590 --> 02:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
70s somebody thought whole language was
 
02:33:26.030 --> 02:33:26.040 align:start position:0%
this great idea we should come up with a
 
02:33:29.349 --> 02:33:29.359 align:start position:0%
new way to teach kids to read and
 
02:33:31.710 --> 02:33:31.720 align:start position:0%
English they tried it in my local school
 
02:33:33.230 --> 02:33:33.240 align:start position:0%
system it was great we could learn to
 
02:33:34.870 --> 02:33:34.880 align:start position:0%
read really
 
02:33:37.389 --> 02:33:37.399 align:start position:0%
fast unfortunately phonetics was not
 
02:33:38.550 --> 02:33:38.560 align:start position:0%
part of the
 
02:33:40.950 --> 02:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
solution so I got to learn phonetics
 
02:33:42.990 --> 02:33:43.000 align:start position:0%
about how to sound out words when we
 
02:33:44.750 --> 02:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
started teaching my
 
02:33:48.150 --> 02:33:48.160 align:start position:0%
children English in my
 
02:33:51.429 --> 02:33:51.439 align:start position:0%
30s guess what learning really big long
 
02:33:53.030 --> 02:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
complicated words like you'd find in the
 
02:33:54.670 --> 02:33:54.680 align:start position:0%
medical field became
 
02:33:56.750 --> 02:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
hard because I couldn't break it down
 
02:33:59.510 --> 02:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
into the constituent
 
02:34:03.349 --> 02:34:03.359 align:start position:0%
Parts was easy in math because I learned
 
02:34:03.359 --> 02:34:05.030 align:start position:0%
Parts was easy in math because I learned
math

02:34:05.030 --> 02:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
math
 
02:34:08.309 --> 02:34:08.319 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that impacted my
 
02:34:11.710 --> 02:34:11.720 align:start position:0%
livelihood and my career
 
02:34:13.870 --> 02:34:13.880 align:start position:0%
choices our school system back then
 
02:34:16.950 --> 02:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
could have done better I want the best
 
02:34:18.389 --> 02:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
education for our children that's
 
02:34:20.349 --> 02:34:20.359 align:start position:0%
possible and if the child is not getting
 
02:34:22.269 --> 02:34:22.279 align:start position:0%
inadequate education meaning the
 
02:34:24.150 --> 02:34:24.160 align:start position:0%
majority of the children are hitting
 
02:34:26.190 --> 02:34:26.200 align:start position:0%
Proficiency in that District it is time
 
02:34:28.150 --> 02:34:28.160 align:start position:0%
to give the parents an option
 
02:34:31.670 --> 02:34:31.680 align:start position:0%
out we choose our education based on zip
 
02:34:34.070 --> 02:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
code and date of birth that's how we
 
02:34:35.630 --> 02:34:35.640 align:start position:0%
assign children to the
 
02:34:39.309 --> 02:34:39.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:42.790 --> 02:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
least sorry that is the most inefficient
 
02:34:45.070 --> 02:34:45.080 align:start position:0%
way to educate a child and to select a
 
02:34:46.910 --> 02:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
classroom has nothing to do with
 
02:34:49.150 --> 02:34:49.160 align:start position:0%
learning style are they an auditory
 
02:34:51.790 --> 02:34:51.800 align:start position:0%
learner do they learn Hands-On are they
 
02:34:53.150 --> 02:34:53.160 align:start position:0%
a visual
 
02:34:55.469 --> 02:34:55.479 align:start position:0%
learner do they have great aptitude and
 
02:34:57.429 --> 02:34:57.439 align:start position:0%
they should be ahead in a classroom no
 
02:34:59.150 --> 02:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
we put them in a classroom and we assign
 
02:35:01.389 --> 02:35:01.399 align:start position:0%
it by date of birth and zip code let's
 
02:35:04.150 --> 02:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
do better than that this bill says if
 
02:35:05.590 --> 02:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
you're not getting a good enough
 
02:35:08.349 --> 02:35:08.359 align:start position:0%
education at your home District then you
 
02:35:10.510 --> 02:35:10.520 align:start position:0%

new students accessing the program
 
02:37:21.750 --> 02:37:21.760 align:start position:0%

in the budget for the program if I know
 
02:37:27.630 --> 02:37:27.640 align:start position:0%
this bill expands eligibility to any
 
02:37:29.990 --> 02:37:30.000 align:start position:0%

03:05:17.670 --> 03:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
1560 this bill will take the remaining
 
03:05:20.750 --> 03:05:20.760 align:start position:0%
balance of the unspent unallocated funds
 
03:05:22.830 --> 03:05:22.840 align:start position:0%
from the education trust fund at the end
 
03:05:25.590 --> 03:05:25.600 align:start position:0%
of each fiscal year and move those
 
03:05:27.630 --> 03:05:27.640 align:start position:0%
Monies to the general
 
03:05:30.229 --> 03:05:30.239 align:start position:0%
fund currently the education trust fund
 
03:05:32.670 --> 03:05:32.680 align:start position:0%
balance is about 160 million and it's
 
03:05:36.309 --> 03:05:36.319 align:start position:0%
projected to grow close to 220 Million
 
03:05:38.269 --> 03:05:38.279 align:start position:0%
by the end of fiscal 25 under our
 
03:05:40.830 --> 03:05:40.840 align:start position:0%
current law the current concern
 
03:05:43.670 --> 03:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
expressed in our committee was that this
 
03:05:45.990 --> 03:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
sum of designated money sitting in the
 
03:05:48.830 --> 03:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
education trust fund is otherwise
 
03:05:52.469 --> 03:05:52.479 align:start position:0%
unavailable to the state so rather than
 
03:05:55.070 --> 03:05:55.080 align:start position:0%
protecting the education trust fund
 
03:05:58.269 --> 03:05:58.279 align:start position:0%
balance for educational purposes as the
 
03:06:01.150 --> 03:06:01.160 align:start position:0%
supreme court ordered in the 1990s and
 
03:06:03.790 --> 03:06:03.800 align:start position:0%
reaffirmed again this year the sponsors
 
03:06:06.469 --> 03:06:06.479 align:start position:0%
believe that the state should be given
 
03:06:09.110 --> 03:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
flexibility to use that money for all
 
03:06:11.630 --> 03:06:11.640 align:start position:0%
other future competing interests of the
 
03:06:14.550 --> 03:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
state proponents say that this bill does
 
03:06:17.030 --> 03:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
not eliminate the fund it just removes
 
03:06:19.750 --> 03:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
the balance at the end of the year so
 
03:06:22.070 --> 03:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund is replenished
 
03:06:23.870 --> 03:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
each year with new Revenue sources so
 
03:06:26.389 --> 03:06:26.399 align:start position:0%
there's nothing to fear but if there's
 
03:06:29.030 --> 03:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
nothing to fear then why did Granite
 
03:06:33.030 --> 03:06:33.040 align:start position:0%
stator sign in 133 to5 in opposition to
 
03:06:36.830 --> 03:06:36.840 align:start position:0%
this bill why did the New Hampshire Nea
 
03:06:38.790 --> 03:06:38.800 align:start position:0%
provide testimony against this bill and
 
03:06:40.309 --> 03:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
why did this bill get rushed through the
 
03:06:44.030 --> 03:06:44.040 align:start position:0%
committee process that's right hb15 1960
 
03:06:46.590 --> 03:06:46.600 align:start position:0%
was introduced in house finance on the
 
03:06:49.550 --> 03:06:49.560 align:start position:0%
morning of January 25th and referred to
 
03:06:53.269 --> 03:06:53.279 align:start position:0%
division 2 before lunch then after lunch
 
03:06:54.750 --> 03:06:54.760 align:start position:0%
the work session resulted in a
 
03:06:57.950 --> 03:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
recommendation of this bill to our full
 
03:07:00.790 --> 03:07:00.800 align:start position:0%
committee and then 3 days later after a
 
03:07:02.950 --> 03:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
long session day on February 1st where
 
03:07:04.950 --> 03:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
members were encouraged to limit
 
03:07:07.750 --> 03:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
discussion house finance voted 13 to 12
 
03:07:09.830 --> 03:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
to bring the bill to the floor today
 
03:07:12.349 --> 03:07:12.359 align:start position:0%
despite the unanswered questions about
 
03:07:14.269 --> 03:07:14.279 align:start position:0%
the attorney general en's interpretation
 
03:07:16.950 --> 03:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
of our recent Supreme Court decisions
 
03:07:20.110 --> 03:07:20.120 align:start position:0%
and our duty as legislators to respond
 
03:07:23.910 --> 03:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
this begs the question why the rush why
 
03:07:25.990 --> 03:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
especially when we know that this exact
 
03:07:29.150 --> 03:07:29.160 align:start position:0%
proposal was stripped out of the
 
03:07:31.110 --> 03:07:31.120 align:start position:0%
stripped out by the esteemed body behind
 
03:07:34.469 --> 03:07:34.479 align:start position:0%
the wall during the recent banian budget
 
03:07:36.630 --> 03:07:36.640 align:start position:0%
negotiations my discussion with members
 
03:07:38.550 --> 03:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
of that body's education committee is
 
03:07:41.309 --> 03:07:41.319 align:start position:0%
that no one there is asking for this and
 
03:07:44.070 --> 03:07:44.080 align:start position:0%
no one's asking for this Rush
 
03:07:46.429 --> 03:07:46.439 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker I oppose this bill for three
 
03:07:49.590 --> 03:07:49.600 align:start position:0%
reasons first the education I'm sorry
 
03:07:49.600 --> 03:07:50.670 align:start position:0%
reasons first the education I'm sorry
educ

03:07:50.670 --> 03:07:50.680 align:start position:0%
educ
 
03:07:53.110 --> 03:07:53.120 align:start position:0%
emptying the balance in the education
 
03:07:54.870 --> 03:07:54.880 align:start position:0%
trust fund at the end of the year is not
 
03:07:57.429 --> 03:07:57.439 align:start position:0%
prudent because of several unknowns
 
03:07:59.910 --> 03:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
monies in the education trust fund must
 
03:08:02.309 --> 03:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
be appropriated for a set of open
 
03:08:04.830 --> 03:08:04.840 align:start position:0%
warrants for things like kind
 
03:08:07.429 --> 03:08:07.439 align:start position:0%
kindergarten education Freedom accounts
 
03:08:09.389 --> 03:08:09.399 align:start position:0%
charter schools and core ordered
 
03:08:11.870 --> 03:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
placements these open warrants are built
 
03:08:13.630 --> 03:08:13.640 align:start position:0%
into the budget but we don't know how
 
03:08:15.670 --> 03:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
much we're going to spend year to year
 
03:08:18.030 --> 03:08:18.040 align:start position:0%
so when things like the education
 
03:08:20.309 --> 03:08:20.319 align:start position:0%
Freedom account program runs millions of
 
03:08:23.269 --> 03:08:23.279 align:start position:0%
dollars over budget or the new program
 
03:08:25.750 --> 03:08:25.760 align:start position:0%
for episodic treatment placements costs
 
03:08:28.550 --> 03:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
more than anticipated in its first year
 
03:08:32.269 --> 03:08:32.279 align:start position:0%
additional funding can be asked can be
 
03:08:34.750 --> 03:08:34.760 align:start position:0%
approved um by going to
 
03:08:37.910 --> 03:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee and once authorized
 
03:08:39.630 --> 03:08:39.640 align:start position:0%
those additional funds must be pulled
 
03:08:42.750 --> 03:08:42.760 align:start position:0%
from the education trust fund under law
 
03:08:45.349 --> 03:08:45.359 align:start position:0%
what the problem is is that there's a
 
03:08:47.950 --> 03:08:47.960 align:start position:0%
history in New Hampshire where when the
 
03:08:49.510 --> 03:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee has authorized those
 
03:08:51.030 --> 03:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
additional funds there has not been
 
03:08:53.510 --> 03:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
enough money in the education trust fund
 
03:08:55.830 --> 03:08:55.840 align:start position:0%
or the general fund to replenish and
 
03:08:58.429 --> 03:08:58.439 align:start position:0%
fully pay for those programs that result
 
03:09:01.590 --> 03:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
is that local taxpayers are on the hook
 
03:09:03.830 --> 03:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
for part of those shortfalls and those
 
03:09:06.670 --> 03:09:06.680 align:start position:0%
localities never recover those funds
 
03:09:09.670 --> 03:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
this is why it's imperative that
 
03:09:11.590 --> 03:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
protected educational monies and the
 
03:09:14.190 --> 03:09:14.200 align:start position:0%
education trust fund must stay in the
 
03:09:16.950 --> 03:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
education trust fund so that monies may
 
03:09:19.950 --> 03:09:19.960 align:start position:0%
be immediately available to backfill
 
03:09:19.960 --> 03:09:21.790 align:start position:0%
be immediately available to backfill
program

03:09:21.790 --> 03:09:21.800 align:start position:0%
program
 
03:09:24.349 --> 03:09:24.359 align:start position:0%
overruns and to lessen the burden our
 
03:09:26.990 --> 03:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
local taxpayers now we know that local
 
03:09:28.950 --> 03:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
taxpayers are already bearing the burden
 
03:09:31.269 --> 03:09:31.279 align:start position:0%
of 80% of New Hampshire's educational
 
03:09:34.150 --> 03:09:34.160 align:start position:0%
costs and this is absolutely the wrong
 
03:09:37.830 --> 03:09:37.840 align:start position:0%
move at the exact wrong time second Mr
 
03:09:40.110 --> 03:09:40.120 align:start position:0%
Speaker I oppose
 
03:09:40.120 --> 03:09:41.910 align:start position:0%
Speaker I oppose
hb50

03:09:41.910 --> 03:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
hb50
 
03:09:44.790 --> 03:09:44.800 align:start position:0%
1560 because the public is aware of
 
03:09:47.830 --> 03:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
these new recent Supreme Court rulings
 
03:09:50.429 --> 03:09:50.439 align:start position:0%
and they're watching us I knocked on
 
03:09:52.389 --> 03:09:52.399 align:start position:0%
over a thousand doors in the last
 
03:09:54.349 --> 03:09:54.359 align:start position:0%
election cycle and the number one
 
03:09:57.190 --> 03:09:57.200 align:start position:0%
constituent issue before my constituents
 
03:09:59.830 --> 03:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
was to protect public school funding it
 
03:10:02.229 --> 03:10:02.239 align:start position:0%
was not to drain the education trust
 
03:10:05.750 --> 03:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
fund the the public is not calling for
 
03:10:07.750 --> 03:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
this change and we must acknowledge that
 
03:10:10.150 --> 03:10:10.160 align:start position:0%
emptying the education trust fund will
 
03:10:13.349 --> 03:10:13.359 align:start position:0%
not reflect the will of the public
 
03:10:15.630 --> 03:10:15.640 align:start position:0%
as one constituent letter to finance put
 
03:10:19.190 --> 03:10:19.200 align:start position:0%
it and I quote we all know the state is
 
03:10:21.670 --> 03:10:21.680 align:start position:0%
shortchanging education and the recent
 
03:10:23.269 --> 03:10:23.279 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court ruling stated funding
 
03:10:24.510 --> 03:10:24.520 align:start position:0%
levels should be
 
03:10:27.910 --> 03:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
doubled end of quote my finance
 
03:10:29.910 --> 03:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
colleague brilliantly said any attempt
 
03:10:31.550 --> 03:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
to divert funds from New Hampshire's
 
03:10:33.910 --> 03:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
education trust fund will send a
 
03:10:36.990 --> 03:10:37.000 align:start position:0%
damaging message to our constituents
 
03:10:38.910 --> 03:10:38.920 align:start position:0%
even if we can move money around when we
 
03:10:41.510 --> 03:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
need it that this will be perceived as
 
03:10:44.950 --> 03:10:44.960 align:start position:0%
an attack on public educ ation yes
 
03:10:46.990 --> 03:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
passing this bill will be seen as an
 
03:10:49.190 --> 03:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
attack on public education at the very
 
03:10:51.429 --> 03:10:51.439 align:start position:0%
moment we've been ordered by our Supreme
 
03:10:56.030 --> 03:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
Court to protect it and to spend more
 
03:10:57.590 --> 03:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
finally Mr
 
03:11:00.389 --> 03:11:00.399 align:start position:0%
Speaker the house special education
 
03:11:02.030 --> 03:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
subcommittee has been tasked with the
 
03:11:04.429 --> 03:11:04.439 align:start position:0%
very question of how to better fund our
 
03:11:06.950 --> 03:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
Public Schools understanding how much
 
03:11:09.429 --> 03:11:09.439 align:start position:0%
money is available is a critical input
 
03:11:11.590 --> 03:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
into determining how much money we have
 
03:11:13.870 --> 03:11:13.880 align:start position:0%
to spend and emptying the education
 
03:11:16.429 --> 03:11:16.439 align:start position:0%
trust fund before the subcommittee has
 
03:11:17.910 --> 03:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
resolved this question is an
 
03:11:20.550 --> 03:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
irresponsible undermining of their work
 
03:11:22.269 --> 03:11:22.279 align:start position:0%
and that's why this bill should go to
 
03:11:24.750 --> 03:11:24.760 align:start position:0%
that subcommittee for these reasons Mr
 
03:11:27.150 --> 03:11:27.160 align:start position:0%
Speaker I urge you to vote no on the
 
03:11:29.550 --> 03:11:29.560 align:start position:0%

03:11:32.190 --> 03:11:32.200 align:start position:0%

thank you uh Mr
 
03:18:17.910 --> 03:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
chair speaker
 
03:18:25.550 --> 03:18:25.560 align:start position:0%
sorry um 1589 out of Judiciary um bill
 
03:18:30.469 --> 03:18:30.479 align:start position:0%
for uh a veteran treatment courts um
 
03:18:34.830 --> 03:18:34.840 align:start position:0%
passed otpa 18 to Zer bipartisan but the
 
03:18:36.750 --> 03:18:36.760 align:start position:0%
amendment the
 
03:18:40.750 --> 03:18:40.760 align:start position:0%
0334 was only approved on a 13-5 and the
 
03:18:43.309 --> 03:18:43.319 align:start position:0%
reason for that was some missing
 
03:18:45.910 --> 03:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
language in the
 
03:18:48.870 --> 03:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
U definition of
 
03:18:52.269 --> 03:18:52.279 align:start position:0%
veteran um there were like five pieces
 
03:18:55.229 --> 03:18:55.239 align:start position:0%
of the definition the piece that was
 
03:18:59.790 --> 03:18:59.800 align:start position:0%
problematic was in Roman 3 on page one
 
03:19:01.950 --> 03:19:01.960 align:start position:0%
in d
 
03:19:05.710 --> 03:19:05.720 align:start position:0%
section and it had written originally
 
03:19:09.710 --> 03:19:09.720 align:start position:0%
and in the 0334 Amendment a current or
 
03:19:12.750 --> 03:19:12.760 align:start position:0%
former military member of a fr foreign
 
03:19:17.870 --> 03:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:20.349 --> 03:19:20.359 align:start position:0%
qualification now it's important to
 
03:19:22.309 --> 03:19:22.319 align:start position:0%
qualify that
 
03:19:26.750 --> 03:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
because we had people working under our
 
03:19:29.150 --> 03:19:29.160 align:start position:0%
Command in combat
 
03:19:32.550 --> 03:19:32.560 align:start position:0%
areas and in coal and working in Co
 
03:19:35.150 --> 03:19:35.160 align:start position:0%
Coalition with Coalition
 
03:19:40.309 --> 03:19:40.319 align:start position:0%
forces so my Amendment adds the missing
 
03:19:42.950 --> 03:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
language that says a a current or former
 
03:19:45.070 --> 03:19:45.080 align:start position:0%
military member of a foreign Allied
 
03:19:48.590 --> 03:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
country who was attached to or under
 
03:19:51.870 --> 03:19:51.880 align:start position:0%
command of United States forces or
 
03:19:55.110 --> 03:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
Coalition forces therewith in a combat
 
03:19:58.510 --> 03:19:58.520 align:start position:0%
operations engagement this is a
 
03:20:01.590 --> 03:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
reciprocal um orientation for this
 
03:20:05.670 --> 03:20:05.680 align:start position:0%
because we have had people um support us
 
03:20:07.790 --> 03:20:07.800 align:start position:0%
who could no longer remain in their
 
03:20:10.790 --> 03:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
country um political Asylum and those
 
03:20:12.630 --> 03:20:12.640 align:start position:0%
have become citizens
 
03:20:14.910 --> 03:20:14.920 align:start position:0%
and that recognizes they performed
 
03:20:19.389 --> 03:20:19.399 align:start position:0%
valuable service to uh our country as uh
 
03:20:23.469 --> 03:20:23.479 align:start position:0%
other veterans uh U that had done so so
 
03:20:26.429 --> 03:20:26.439 align:start position:0%
I'm asking for you to help us clean that
 
03:20:30.150 --> 03:20:30.160 align:start position:0%
up and approve uh this uh amendment to
 
03:20:33.750 --> 03:20:33.760 align:start position:0%

03:26:02.710 --> 03:26:02.720 align:start position:0%
replacing our aging ACU vote machines so
 
03:26:06.710 --> 03:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
we have approved two new machines um and
 
03:26:09.349 --> 03:26:09.359 align:start position:0%
we are this bill is a housekeeping Bill
 
03:26:12.630 --> 03:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
to change B basically our current rsas
 
03:26:14.630 --> 03:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
are all written around the acuo machines
 
03:26:15.710 --> 03:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
they're written about around how the
 
03:26:18.110 --> 03:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
acuo machines work so everything in this
 
03:26:20.790 --> 03:26:20.800 align:start position:0%
is just changing it so an example is one
 
03:26:24.469 --> 03:26:24.479 align:start position:0%
of the machines reads squares our RSA
 
03:26:26.910 --> 03:26:26.920 align:start position:0%
says ovals so it's things like that to
 
03:26:29.030 --> 03:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
housekeeping bill it's not substantively
 
03:26:31.469 --> 03:26:31.479 align:start position:0%
changing how we operate our elections or
 
03:26:33.229 --> 03:26:33.239 align:start position:0%
anything like that it's just clearing
 
03:26:35.229 --> 03:26:35.239 align:start position:0%
the way for this process that has been o
 
03:26:37.429 --> 03:26:37.439 align:start position:0%
over the last six years so with that I
 
03:26:39.429 --> 03:26:39.439 align:start position:0%
would ask that the body move to concur
 
03:26:42.590 --> 03:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
with House Bill 154 the motion before us
 
03:26:44.750 --> 03:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
is the current House Bill 154 are ready
 
03:26:46.309 --> 03:26:46.319 align:start position:0%
for the question all those in favor say
 
03:26:49.349 --> 03:26:49.359 align:start position:0%
I I those oppose
 
03:27:03.150 --> 03:27:03.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:05.189 --> 03:27:05.199 align:start position:0%
passes majority of the committee on
 
03:27:06.870 --> 03:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
legislative Administration which was
 
03:27:09.950 --> 03:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
referred House Bill 1000 an act relative
 
03:27:12.189 --> 03:27:12.199 align:start position:0%
to classifying New Hampshire legislative
 
03:27:14.150 --> 03:27:14.160 align:start position:0%
Service as public service for certain
 
03:27:16.429 --> 03:27:16.439 align:start position:0%
federal purposes consider the same
 
03:27:17.750 --> 03:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
report the same with the following
 
03:27:20.110 --> 03:27:20.120 align:start position:0%
resolution resolve that is inexpedient
 
03:27:22.309 --> 03:27:22.319 align:start position:0%
to legislate representative Michael
 
03:27:25.790 --> 03:27:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:27.910 --> 03:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
majority minority of the committee
 
03:27:29.510 --> 03:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
having considered the same being unable
 
03:27:31.070 --> 03:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
to agree with the majority Report with
 
03:27:32.389 --> 03:27:32.399 align:start position:0%
the recommendation that the bill ought
 
03:27:34.229 --> 03:27:34.239 align:start position:0%
to pass representative Allison nning
 
03:27:36.429 --> 03:27:36.439 align:start position:0%
Wong for the minority of the committee
 
03:27:40.309 --> 03:27:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:40.319 --> 03:27:45.150 align:start position:0%

03:27:45.150 --> 03:27:45.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:46.790 --> 03:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
03:27:50.229 --> 03:27:50.239 align:start position:0%
Speaker in 2007 under the George W Bush
 
03:27:52.070 --> 03:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
Administration the federal government
 
03:27:54.389 --> 03:27:54.399 align:start position:0%
started the Public service loan
 
03:27:57.710 --> 03:27:57.720 align:start position:0%
forgiveness program whereby in order to
 
03:27:59.550 --> 03:27:59.560 align:start position:0%
encourage young people to enter Public
 
03:28:02.030 --> 03:28:02.040 align:start position:0%
Service which frequently doesn't pay as
 
03:28:04.389 --> 03:28:04.399 align:start position:0%
much um the federal government if you
 
03:28:06.630 --> 03:28:06.640 align:start position:0%
serve in public service for 10 years and
 
03:28:08.469 --> 03:28:08.479 align:start position:0%
make ontime payments on your student
 
03:28:10.710 --> 03:28:10.720 align:start position:0%
loans for those 10 years you would get
 
03:28:12.790 --> 03:28:12.800 align:start position:0%
the remainder of your federal student
 
03:28:12.800 --> 03:28:16.349 align:start position:0%
the remainder of your federal student
loans

03:28:16.349 --> 03:28:16.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:20.750 --> 03:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
forgiven I think I I hope that no one
 
03:28:22.510 --> 03:28:22.520 align:start position:0%
would argue that
 
03:28:25.630 --> 03:28:25.640 align:start position:0%
we offer Public Service I hope we're all
 
03:28:28.150 --> 03:28:28.160 align:start position:0%
here to serve the
 
03:28:31.389 --> 03:28:31.399 align:start position:0%
public it turns out almost every other
 
03:28:35.110 --> 03:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
state certifies their state legislators
 
03:28:37.110 --> 03:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
as public servants for the purposes of
 
03:28:39.830 --> 03:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
this program virtually every other state
 
03:28:42.269 --> 03:28:42.279 align:start position:0%
most of which are part-time
 
03:28:45.309 --> 03:28:45.319 align:start position:0%
ncsl was consulted to ask which of these
 
03:28:46.950 --> 03:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
states and we could only find two that
 
03:28:49.550 --> 03:28:49.560 align:start position:0%
didn't virtually every other state
 
03:28:52.269 --> 03:28:52.279 align:start position:0%
certifies public service for their state
 
03:28:54.630 --> 03:28:54.640 align:start position:0%
legislators some of them are so
 
03:28:56.349 --> 03:28:56.359 align:start position:0%
part-time that they only serve one out
 
03:28:59.229 --> 03:28:59.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:02.670 --> 03:29:02.680 align:start position:0%
years the decision on whether to certify
 
03:29:05.710 --> 03:29:05.720 align:start position:0%
our public service is a decision of this
 
03:29:08.389 --> 03:29:08.399 align:start position:0%
body like it has been for every other
 
03:29:10.630 --> 03:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
state in addition the commissioner of
 
03:29:11.790 --> 03:29:11.800 align:start position:0%
the Department of administrative
 
03:29:13.950 --> 03:29:13.960 align:start position:0%
Services has repeatedly said that he is
 
03:29:18.150 --> 03:29:18.160 align:start position:0%
fine in support certifying our Public
 
03:29:21.150 --> 03:29:21.160 align:start position:0%
Service as a donor State our New
 
03:29:24.389 --> 03:29:24.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire federal tax dollars instead of
 
03:29:27.070 --> 03:29:27.080 align:start position:0%
going to forgive some of the public the
 
03:29:28.790 --> 03:29:28.800 align:start position:0%
the public loans for our state
 
03:29:30.790 --> 03:29:30.800 align:start position:0%
legislators is going to
 
03:29:32.790 --> 03:29:32.800 align:start position:0%
forgive the student loans of
 
03:29:35.670 --> 03:29:35.680 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts state reps California
 
03:29:38.590 --> 03:29:38.600 align:start position:0%
state reps New York State reps but not
 
03:29:42.030 --> 03:29:42.040 align:start position:0%
our own we desperately need young people
 
03:29:45.910 --> 03:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
in this chamber we desperately need
 
03:29:49.189 --> 03:29:49.199 align:start position:0%
fresh blood newer ideas and we Beman the
 
03:29:52.030 --> 03:29:52.040 align:start position:0%
fact that we have a graying problem in
 
03:29:55.150 --> 03:29:55.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and in this
 
03:29:58.510 --> 03:29:58.520 align:start position:0%
chamber this body is significantly older
 
03:30:00.389 --> 03:30:00.399 align:start position:0%
and significantly different in many ways
 
03:30:03.670 --> 03:30:03.680 align:start position:0%
than the average New Hampshire citizens
 
03:30:05.910 --> 03:30:05.920 align:start position:0%
and so in order to encourage young
 
03:30:07.030 --> 03:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
people to
 
03:30:12.030 --> 03:30:12.040 align:start position:0%
serve we can certify our public service
 
03:30:14.590 --> 03:30:14.600 align:start position:0%
without costing the state a single
 
03:30:18.189 --> 03:30:18.199 align:start position:0%
dime as was the intention of that
 
03:30:21.469 --> 03:30:21.479 align:start position:0%
program so I ask you to overturn the itl
 
03:30:24.590 --> 03:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
and support OTP on
 
03:30:28.990 --> 03:30:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:32.030 --> 03:30:32.040 align:start position:0%
con does a member yield to
 
03:30:33.790 --> 03:30:33.800 align:start position:0%
questions I
 
03:30:36.269 --> 03:30:36.279 align:start position:0%
do member Mo
 
03:30:38.269 --> 03:30:38.279 align:start position:0%
inquire thank you Mr Speaker and thank
 
03:30:40.309 --> 03:30:40.319 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question uh I know
 
03:30:42.429 --> 03:30:42.439 align:start position:0%
that we've heard a a lot that uh we are
 
03:30:43.990 --> 03:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
supposedly not employees for the
 
03:30:45.910 --> 03:30:45.920 align:start position:0%
purposes of the state but isn't it true
 
03:30:47.229 --> 03:30:47.239 align:start position:0%
that the federal government does
 
03:30:50.269 --> 03:30:50.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:52.830 --> 03:30:52.840 align:start position:0%
employees thank you for the question it
 
03:30:55.630 --> 03:30:55.640 align:start position:0%
is indeed true that even though we often
 
03:30:59.229 --> 03:30:59.239 align:start position:0%
say that while our salary was set in the
 
03:31:01.349 --> 03:31:01.359 align:start position:0%
Constitution we're not employees of the
 
03:31:03.349 --> 03:31:03.359 align:start position:0%
State uh the federal government doesn't
 
03:31:05.189 --> 03:31:05.199 align:start position:0%
seem to care too much about that because
 
03:31:08.429 --> 03:31:08.439 align:start position:0%
as we all just recently got our W2s W2s
 
03:31:10.550 --> 03:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
you can look them up are only given to
 
03:31:13.189 --> 03:31:13.199 align:start position:0%
employees in addition we pay taxes
 
03:31:15.070 --> 03:31:15.080 align:start position:0%
federal taxes Medicaid and Social
 
03:31:17.070 --> 03:31:17.080 align:start position:0%
Security taxes out of those W2 so the
 
03:31:19.790 --> 03:31:19.800 align:start position:0%
federal government does indeed consider
 
03:31:23.349 --> 03:31:23.359 align:start position:0%
us employees of um consider us employees
 
03:31:25.990 --> 03:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
in addition the Ein the employer
 
03:31:28.950 --> 03:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
identification number that is on our W2s
 
03:31:30.990 --> 03:31:31.000 align:start position:0%
that's how the federal government
 
03:31:32.950 --> 03:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
determines whether or not your employer
 
03:31:35.670 --> 03:31:35.680 align:start position:0%
qualifies as public service that Ein
 
03:31:36.469 --> 03:31:36.479 align:start position:0%
which is
 
03:31:41.710 --> 03:31:41.720 align:start position:0%
02600 618 is the same Ein as every every
 
03:31:44.710 --> 03:31:44.720 align:start position:0%
state employee in this state Department
 
03:31:47.510 --> 03:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
of Transportation uh education you name
 
03:31:49.309 --> 03:31:49.319 align:start position:0%
it every single employee has the same
 
03:31:52.670 --> 03:31:52.680 align:start position:0%
Ein that we do and that Ein is
 
03:31:55.910 --> 03:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
considered public service by the federal
 
03:31:58.349 --> 03:31:58.359 align:start position:0%
government furthermore even though we
 
03:32:01.429 --> 03:32:01.439 align:start position:0%
are elected we have state employees who
 
03:32:04.429 --> 03:32:04.439 align:start position:0%
are hired and fired through election or
 
03:32:07.030 --> 03:32:07.040 align:start position:0%
in reelection including the Secretary of
 
03:32:09.269 --> 03:32:09.279 align:start position:0%
State the treasurer and the clerk all of
 
03:32:12.910 --> 03:32:12.920 align:start position:0%
which do qualify for Public service loan
 
03:32:16.030 --> 03:32:16.040 align:start position:0%
forgiveness we've already extended in
 
03:32:17.910 --> 03:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
legislation um things like health
 
03:32:21.150 --> 03:32:21.160 align:start position:0%
insurance benefits to the body because
 
03:32:23.229 --> 03:32:23.239 align:start position:0%
we can acknowledge that we're not
 
03:32:25.469 --> 03:32:25.479 align:start position:0%
employees for the purposes of the state
 
03:32:27.510 --> 03:32:27.520 align:start position:0%
while still extending those benefits
 
03:32:29.389 --> 03:32:29.399 align:start position:0%
this is just another extension of
 
03:32:31.189 --> 03:32:31.199 align:start position:0%
benefits we still wouldn't be considered
 
03:32:33.229 --> 03:32:33.239 align:start position:0%
employees by the state but the federal
 
03:32:35.189 --> 03:32:35.199 align:start position:0%
government already considers employees
 
03:32:36.630 --> 03:32:36.640 align:start position:0%
so it's just an extension of those
 
03:32:39.229 --> 03:32:39.239 align:start position:0%
benefits and it costs us
 
03:32:47.710 --> 03:32:47.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:51.630 --> 03:32:51.640 align:start position:0%
crossable thank you Mr Speaker I rise in
 
03:32:54.870 --> 03:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
support of the committee report of it in
 
03:32:54.880 --> 03:32:57.309 align:start position:0%
support of the committee report of it in
hp1000

03:32:57.309 --> 03:32:57.319 align:start position:0%
hp1000
 
03:33:00.750 --> 03:33:00.760 align:start position:0%
so there seems to be what the proponents
 
03:33:02.710 --> 03:33:02.720 align:start position:0%
of this bill would want to do is
 
03:33:05.950 --> 03:33:05.960 align:start position:0%
to make a gray area of what we are in
 
03:33:08.990 --> 03:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
terms of employees in terms of full-time
 
03:33:13.189 --> 03:33:13.199 align:start position:0%
and um it's it's not a gray area for
 
03:33:17.269 --> 03:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
me are you elected or are we employees
 
03:33:20.590 --> 03:33:20.600 align:start position:0%
of the state it's that simple yes or no
 
03:33:24.750 --> 03:33:24.760 align:start position:0%
the answer is no we are elected the $200
 
03:33:27.870 --> 03:33:27.880 align:start position:0%
W2 I would argue is a reason that um
 
03:33:30.309 --> 03:33:30.319 align:start position:0%
maybe we should look into re um
 
03:33:32.269 --> 03:33:32.279 align:start position:0%
addressing that clerical error it does
 
03:33:34.429 --> 03:33:34.439 align:start position:0%
not mean we employees of the
 
03:33:38.469 --> 03:33:38.479 align:start position:0%
state another point of this is that on
 
03:33:41.510 --> 03:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
average for the two-year term you would
 
03:33:43.389 --> 03:33:43.399 align:start position:0%
you would have needed to work 30 hours
 
03:33:47.269 --> 03:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
per week how many of you in July and
 
03:33:50.429 --> 03:33:50.439 align:start position:0%
August will attest that you've been here
 
03:33:53.910 --> 03:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
30 hours per week on any given it is for
 
03:33:56.030 --> 03:33:56.040 align:start position:0%
the whole it is not for the six months
 
03:33:57.950 --> 03:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
that you're here it's for the whole
 
03:34:01.630 --> 03:34:01.640 align:start position:0%
year um we so and we've never been
 
03:34:04.429 --> 03:34:04.439 align:start position:0%
considered a full-time legislature
 
03:34:07.870 --> 03:34:07.880 align:start position:0%
everyone says we are a volunteer
 
03:34:12.750 --> 03:34:12.760 align:start position:0%
part-time citizen legislature okay so to
 
03:34:15.510 --> 03:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
bend the rules to fit into this Federal
 
03:34:18.950 --> 03:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
program to me is is
 
03:34:22.670 --> 03:34:22.680 align:start position:0%
wrong um part one section one Roman
 
03:34:25.469 --> 03:34:25.479 align:start position:0%
numeral one of our ethics guidelines
 
03:34:27.110 --> 03:34:27.120 align:start position:0%
it's the first thing you read in your
 
03:34:29.229 --> 03:34:29.239 align:start position:0%
ethics guidelines and I'll paraphrase
 
03:34:32.229 --> 03:34:32.239 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to read it exactly is that
 
03:34:35.030 --> 03:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
we in this body should use our power and
 
03:34:37.910 --> 03:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
resource for the general interest of the
 
03:34:40.750 --> 03:34:40.760 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire and not to attain
 
03:34:43.910 --> 03:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
personal benefits I there's no good
 
03:34:46.229 --> 03:34:46.239 align:start position:0%
argument to say that a personal benefit
 
03:34:48.389 --> 03:34:48.399 align:start position:0%
of loan forgiveness is in the general
 
03:34:51.750 --> 03:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
interest of this state it's just simply
 
03:34:54.910 --> 03:34:54.920 align:start position:0%
not true it is a personal benefit that
 
03:34:57.830 --> 03:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
we should not be voting for
 
03:35:00.590 --> 03:35:00.600 align:start position:0%
ourselves it also begs the
 
03:35:02.750 --> 03:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
question how many of us have student
 
03:35:06.070 --> 03:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
loans in this body that would be
 
03:35:08.790 --> 03:35:08.800 align:start position:0%
possibly subject to the the windfall
 
03:35:11.630 --> 03:35:11.640 align:start position:0%
here um and I would look forward to the
 
03:35:14.550 --> 03:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
the uh letters of intent uh to
 
03:35:17.910 --> 03:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
participate on whether or not we we we
 
03:35:19.950 --> 03:35:19.960 align:start position:0%
hold student loans and should we even be
 
03:35:22.630 --> 03:35:22.640 align:start position:0%
allowed to vote on on that sort of
 
03:35:22.640 --> 03:35:25.830 align:start position:0%
allowed to vote on on that sort of
thing

03:35:25.830 --> 03:35:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:28.469 --> 03:35:28.479 align:start position:0%
um the the last thing I'll bring up real
 
03:35:31.750 --> 03:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
quick is this pushes the attestation of
 
03:35:34.389 --> 03:35:34.399 align:start position:0%
of certifying that we are full-time
 
03:35:37.870 --> 03:35:37.880 align:start position:0%
public employees not on us but onto the
 
03:35:39.710 --> 03:35:39.720 align:start position:0%
general Administration and and some
 
03:35:41.229 --> 03:35:41.239 align:start position:0%
people may have said they okay with that
 
03:35:43.309 --> 03:35:43.319 align:start position:0%
but go but but you're pushing under
 
03:35:45.349 --> 03:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
penalty of perjury on on this Pro
 
03:35:47.790 --> 03:35:47.800 align:start position:0%
program onto the administrative staff
 
03:35:49.950 --> 03:35:49.960 align:start position:0%
and not onto the person that is saying
 
03:35:53.670 --> 03:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
that um they're they're full-time and so
 
03:35:56.070 --> 03:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
for all four of these reasons I would
 
03:35:57.950 --> 03:35:57.960 align:start position:0%
ask you to support the committee of itl
 
03:35:59.550 --> 03:35:59.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker does the member
 
03:36:01.030 --> 03:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
yield to
 
03:36:01.040 --> 03:36:02.910 align:start position:0%
yield to
questions

03:36:02.910 --> 03:36:02.920 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:36:08.670 --> 03:36:08.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:10.750 --> 03:36:10.760 align:start position:0%
inquire I want to thank my friend from
 
03:36:10.760 --> 03:36:12.790 align:start position:0%
inquire I want to thank my friend from
legislative

03:36:12.790 --> 03:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
03:36:14.550 --> 03:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
Administration this mic needs to be
 
03:36:17.110 --> 03:36:17.120 align:start position:0%
turned up a bit I think I don't know
 
03:36:18.550 --> 03:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
thank you my friend from legislative
 
03:36:21.309 --> 03:36:21.319 align:start position:0%
Administration my question to you is uh
 
03:36:23.150 --> 03:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
you said Sheriff uh elected officials
 
03:36:24.950 --> 03:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
are not employees would that include
 
03:36:27.189 --> 03:36:27.199 align:start position:0%
sheriffs of the counties are would they
 
03:36:28.790 --> 03:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
be considered
 
03:36:32.870 --> 03:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
employees um yes but I I would note that
 
03:36:34.830 --> 03:36:34.840 align:start position:0%
this isn't all of the above it's not one
 
03:36:37.550 --> 03:36:37.560 align:start position:0%
or the other and if you like I said it
 
03:36:39.870 --> 03:36:39.880 align:start position:0%
is not just employees even if you bought
 
03:36:42.510 --> 03:36:42.520 align:start position:0%
into the W 2 argument you still have to
 
03:36:45.309 --> 03:36:45.319 align:start position:0%
claim the 30 hours per week for for the
 
03:36:47.389 --> 03:36:47.399 align:start position:0%
full two-year term for the full two
 
03:36:50.150 --> 03:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
years and even if you could claim a
 
03:36:52.110 --> 03:36:52.120 align:start position:0%
certain number of weeks during that
 
03:36:54.070 --> 03:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
six-month period that we're here I think
 
03:36:56.590 --> 03:36:56.600 align:start position:0%
would be a stretch you you still need
 
03:37:01.309 --> 03:37:01.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:05.070 --> 03:37:05.080 align:start position:0%

M Mr

Speaker if I

know that given all the responsibilities
 
03:38:59.030 --> 03:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
we in this legislature
 
03:39:02.389 --> 03:39:02.399 align:start position:0%
have it does not
 
03:39:02.399 --> 03:39:04.229 align:start position:0%
have it does not
include

03:39:04.229 --> 03:39:04.239 align:start position:0%

03:39:07.870 --> 03:39:07.880 align:start position:0%
interpreting for the federal government
 
03:39:09.870 --> 03:39:09.880 align:start position:0%
what the federal government should or
 
03:39:14.990 --> 03:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
should do and if I know that in
 
03:39:17.950 --> 03:39:17.960 align:start position:0%
virtually every
 
03:39:22.389 --> 03:39:22.399 align:start position:0%
state the states that meet 90
 
03:39:26.550 --> 03:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
days in a year the states that meet 90
 
03:39:29.870 --> 03:39:29.880 align:start position:0%
days in two years the states that meet
 
03:39:33.630 --> 03:39:33.640 align:start position:0%
every other year in practically every
 
03:39:35.790 --> 03:39:35.800 align:start position:0%
state in the United
 
03:39:39.429 --> 03:39:39.439 align:start position:0%
States this program is available for
 
03:39:42.910 --> 03:39:42.920 align:start position:0%
legislators who are paid at rates That
 
03:39:46.269 --> 03:39:46.279 align:start position:0%
Vary dramatically and the federal
 
03:39:48.950 --> 03:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
government responsible for this
 
03:39:53.710 --> 03:39:53.720 align:start position:0%
program have agreed to that
 
03:39:56.269 --> 03:39:56.279 align:start position:0%
eligibility not something that we have
 
03:39:58.349 --> 03:39:58.359 align:start position:0%
to worry about that's for them to worry
 
03:40:01.229 --> 03:40:01.239 align:start position:0%
about and if I
 
03:40:06.189 --> 03:40:06.199 align:start position:0%
know that just today I heard about one
 
03:40:10.189 --> 03:40:10.199 align:start position:0%
of our wonderful colleagues who is not
 
03:40:12.630 --> 03:40:12.640 align:start position:0%
going to be able to run again next year
 
03:40:14.710 --> 03:40:14.720 align:start position:0%
depriving us of that
 
03:40:18.750 --> 03:40:18.760 align:start position:0%
experience because of the problems of
 
03:40:22.349 --> 03:40:22.359 align:start position:0%
trying to pay back loans and if I know
 
03:40:25.510 --> 03:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
to be eligible you have to have been you
 
03:40:28.269 --> 03:40:28.279 align:start position:0%
have to have been in the program paying
 
03:40:31.710 --> 03:40:31.720 align:start position:0%
for 10 years once a
 
03:40:36.070 --> 03:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
month and if I know I said it I thought
 
03:40:38.950 --> 03:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
that you have to be have paid for 10
 
03:40:43.510 --> 03:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
years made a 100 20 payments on time
 
03:40:46.590 --> 03:40:46.600 align:start position:0%
following the requirements before you
 
03:40:49.910 --> 03:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
could be com con considered for this and
 
03:40:51.710 --> 03:40:51.720 align:start position:0%
if I know that with all those
 
03:40:53.510 --> 03:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
protections and with the federal
 
03:40:56.309 --> 03:40:56.319 align:start position:0%
government not being overly
 
03:40:58.990 --> 03:40:59.000 align:start position:0%
generous they have managed to approve
 
03:41:02.309 --> 03:41:02.319 align:start position:0%
this for every other state would I now
 
03:41:05.389 --> 03:41:05.399 align:start position:0%
say that New Hampshire legislators
 
03:41:08.510 --> 03:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
should be entitled to the same benefits
 
03:41:11.990 --> 03:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
that other legisl are across the country
 
03:41:16.229 --> 03:41:16.239 align:start position:0%
and therefore would you vote no on itl
 
03:41:18.630 --> 03:41:18.640 align:start position:0%
so that another motion could be made
 
03:41:21.469 --> 03:41:21.479 align:start position:0%
thank you do recognize repres
 
03:41:23.189 --> 03:41:23.199 align:start position:0%

inquir thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
03:41:31.389 --> 03:41:31.399 align:start position:0%

03:41:34.229 --> 03:41:34.239 align:start position:0%
have never been considered employees as
 
03:41:36.349 --> 03:41:36.359 align:start position:0%
required by the provisions of this
 
03:41:36.359 --> 03:41:37.510 align:start position:0%

Federal

03:41:37.510 --> 03:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
Federal
 
03:41:40.189 --> 03:41:40.199 align:start position:0%
program and if I know to qualify for for
 
03:41:42.229 --> 03:41:42.239 align:start position:0%
this program The General Court
 
03:41:43.990 --> 03:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
Administration would be required to
 
03:41:46.349 --> 03:41:46.359 align:start position:0%
certify to the federal government under
 
03:41:48.750 --> 03:41:48.760 align:start position:0%
penalty of perjury that a given
 
03:41:50.309 --> 03:41:50.319 align:start position:0%
representative or Senator worked
 
03:41:53.349 --> 03:41:53.359 align:start position:0%
full-time averaging 30 hours per week
 
03:41:56.550 --> 03:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
for the entire two-year term and lastly
 
03:41:58.550 --> 03:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that a
 
03:42:00.269 --> 03:42:00.279 align:start position:0%
representative or Senator would be
 
03:42:02.510 --> 03:42:02.520 align:start position:0%
receiving a personal benefit that would
 
03:42:04.670 --> 03:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
most likely not be available to our
 
03:42:06.670 --> 03:42:06.680 align:start position:0%

shortterm
 
03:44:38.910 --> 03:44:38.920 align:start position:0%
commission until November and that's it
 
03:44:41.590 --> 03:44:41.600 align:start position:0%
of six leg legislators half from each
 
03:44:44.469 --> 03:44:44.479 align:start position:0%

of our
 
03:44:57.990 --> 03:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
lbo the purpose is to develop a bill to
 
03:45:01.110 --> 03:45:01.120 align:start position:0%
add nonpartisan Dynamic analysis to our
 
03:45:04.030 --> 03:45:04.040 align:start position:0%
state's fiscal
 
03:45:07.469 --> 03:45:07.479 align:start position:0%
tollbox on we are confident that we can
 
03:45:09.710 --> 03:45:09.720 align:start position:0%
assemble a team quickly enough to comp
 
03:45:12.229 --> 03:45:12.239 align:start position:0%
complete the work by the November
 
03:45:15.429 --> 03:45:15.439 align:start position:0%
deadline this economics tool can be very
 
03:45:17.429 --> 03:45:17.439 align:start position:0%
useful for our decision making on
 
03:45:20.590 --> 03:45:20.600 align:start position:0%
financial issues we sometimes have
 
03:45:22.910 --> 03:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
attractive bills for new programs that
 
03:45:25.750 --> 03:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
would require new expenditures the
 
03:45:27.550 --> 03:45:27.560 align:start position:0%
sponsors say they will pay for
 
03:45:30.389 --> 03:45:30.399 align:start position:0%
themselves if in the end if only by
 
03:45:33.590 --> 03:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
making the workforce healthier or more
 
03:45:36.550 --> 03:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
qualified but is that really true and
 
03:45:39.429 --> 03:45:39.439 align:start position:0%
will it take decades or years to pay it
 
03:45:39.439 --> 03:45:40.990 align:start position:0%
will it take decades or years to pay it
back

03:45:40.990 --> 03:45:41.000 align:start position:0%
back
 
03:45:42.870 --> 03:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
that question is what kept us from
 
03:45:47.429 --> 03:45:47.439 align:start position:0%
passing adult dental care for 15
 
03:45:51.510 --> 03:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
years the basic tool is an unbiased
 
03:45:53.469 --> 03:45:53.479 align:start position:0%
econometric model which has been
 
03:45:56.630 --> 03:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
developed over 40 years feeding in data
 
03:46:00.229 --> 03:46:00.239 align:start position:0%
from changes made in many states we
 
03:46:02.389 --> 03:46:02.399 align:start position:0%
would use it to create a model of how
 
03:46:05.590 --> 03:46:05.600 align:start position:0%
our own State economy works that would
 
03:46:08.670 --> 03:46:08.680 align:start position:0%
be used to project the change proposed
 
03:46:10.229 --> 03:46:10.239 align:start position:0%
by a bill
 
03:46:14.189 --> 03:46:14.199 align:start position:0%
which on W what that bill would do five
 
03:46:17.149 --> 03:46:17.159 align:start position:0%
10 20 years out if we passed
 
03:46:20.389 --> 03:46:20.399 align:start position:0%
it changes to our employment our wage
 
03:46:23.309 --> 03:46:23.319 align:start position:0%
levels our education levels Health costs
 
03:46:26.070 --> 03:46:26.080 align:start position:0%
revenues expenditures whatever factors
 
03:46:29.469 --> 03:46:29.479 align:start position:0%
we feel are the most important the model
 
03:46:30.550 --> 03:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
is the
 
03:46:32.790 --> 03:46:32.800 align:start position:0%
infrastructure the building of our own
 
03:46:35.950 --> 03:46:35.960 align:start position:0%
model selection of a local operator and
 
03:46:38.630 --> 03:46:38.640 align:start position:0%
choice of which proposals to submit to
 
03:46:41.510 --> 03:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
it yearly would be up to
 
03:46:45.269 --> 03:46:45.279 align:start position:0%
us the econ economics team behind the
 
03:46:47.630 --> 03:46:47.640 align:start position:0%
national model would help the local
 
03:46:50.110 --> 03:46:50.120 align:start position:0%
operator learn the model and adapt it to
 
03:46:53.550 --> 03:46:53.560 align:start position:0%
our state the team I have observed over
 
03:46:55.750 --> 03:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
the last few years has worked with red
 
03:46:58.670 --> 03:46:58.680 align:start position:0%
States and blue States they produce
 
03:47:01.229 --> 03:47:01.239 align:start position:0%
external Revenue estimates and other
 
03:47:03.870 --> 03:47:03.880 align:start position:0%
special projects for many states and
 
03:47:03.880 --> 03:47:04.870 align:start position:0%

03:47:04.870 --> 03:47:04.880 align:start position:0%

03:47:10.229 --> 03:47:10.239 align:start position:0%
counties the New Hampshire Department of
 
03:47:13.149 --> 03:47:13.159 align:start position:0%
Employment Security already has this
 
03:47:15.870 --> 03:47:15.880 align:start position:0%
special unit which is the one that has
 
03:47:17.630 --> 03:47:17.640 align:start position:0%
been producing the really good
 
03:47:20.110 --> 03:47:20.120 align:start position:0%
employment analysis we've been seeing
 
03:47:22.950 --> 03:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
these past two year two
 
03:47:26.429 --> 03:47:26.439 align:start position:0%
terms the value of this tool is not in
 
03:47:29.389 --> 03:47:29.399 align:start position:0%
telling us what to do it is in providing
 
03:47:33.189 --> 03:47:33.199 align:start position:0%
an outside voice to put beh beside our
 
03:47:36.229 --> 03:47:36.239 align:start position:0%
current sources of information but a
 
03:47:38.309 --> 03:47:38.319 align:start position:0%
voice that has been trained to look
 
03:47:40.070 --> 03:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
longitudinally over
 
03:47:40.080 --> 03:47:41.910 align:start position:0%
longitudinally over
overtime

03:47:41.910 --> 03:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
overtime
 
03:47:44.429 --> 03:47:44.439 align:start position:0%
forecasting we have an incredibly good
 
03:47:47.110 --> 03:47:47.120 align:start position:0%
Revenue Department but when it estimates
 
03:47:49.309 --> 03:47:49.319 align:start position:0%
the business taxes and the interest in
 
03:47:52.990 --> 03:47:53.000 align:start position:0%
dividends for us it bases its decisions
 
03:47:55.429 --> 03:47:55.439 align:start position:0%
on three-year-old
 
03:47:59.750 --> 03:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
numbers because it will not go past hard
 
03:48:03.030 --> 03:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
facts even the comprehensive annual
 
03:48:05.630 --> 03:48:05.640 align:start position:0%
financial report of the state is not
 
03:48:09.110 --> 03:48:09.120 align:start position:0%
hard fact because audits on individual
 
03:48:11.630 --> 03:48:11.640 align:start position:0%
tax spares have not yet been
 
03:48:14.630 --> 03:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
completed we in Ways and Means need both
 
03:48:17.750 --> 03:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
s sources to combine with our own
 
03:48:20.349 --> 03:48:20.359 align:start position:0%
estimates as my distinguished colleague
 
03:48:24.030 --> 03:48:24.040 align:start position:0%
from Hudson always says we need Dynamic
 
03:48:27.149 --> 03:48:27.159 align:start position:0%
analysis analysis that both parties can
 
03:48:30.710 --> 03:48:30.720 align:start position:0%
have confidence in I hope you will allow
 
03:48:34.590 --> 03:48:34.600 align:start position:0%
this bipartisan commission with experts
 
03:48:36.790 --> 03:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
to go forward so we can bring you a
 
03:48:40.110 --> 03:48:40.120 align:start position:0%
proposal that best suits our state
 
03:48:40.120 --> 03:48:41.110 align:start position:0%

commission the bill as introduced tries
 
03:49:04.950 --> 03:49:04.960 align:start position:0%
to squeeze a complicated commission into
 
03:49:07.910 --> 03:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
the month prior to the November deadline

in an election year
 
03:49:12.590 --> 03:49:12.600 align:start position:0%
and we felt that it would likely produce
 
03:49:15.790 --> 03:49:15.800 align:start position:0%
poor results we felt a much better plan
 
03:49:18.630 --> 03:49:18.640 align:start position:0%
for the desired outcome would be an ad

all elected every two years and if I
 
03:51:14.429 --> 03:51:14.439 align:start position:0%
believe that having a commission to
 
03:51:17.189 --> 03:51:17.199 align:start position:0%
consider how to take a careful and
 
03:51:18.950 --> 03:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
considerate look at our state's
 
03:51:22.189 --> 03:51:22.199 align:start position:0%
long-term needs and Trends so they can

thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
know

03:51:39.830 --> 03:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:51:41.790 --> 03:51:41.800 align:start position:0%
that longer term studies would seem to
 
03:51:44.389 --> 03:51:44.399 align:start position:0%
be a valuable tool for a few select
 
03:51:47.429 --> 03:51:47.439 align:start position:0%
bills during this budgeting year and I
 
03:51:49.550 --> 03:51:49.560 align:start position:0%
know that the finance committee could
 
03:51:52.590 --> 03:51:52.600 align:start position:0%
examine a bill next year to fund a pilot
 
03:51:54.790 --> 03:51:54.800 align:start position:0%

this modeling and lastly Mr Speaker if I
 
03:51:59.590 --> 03:51:59.600 align:start position:0%
know it is very unlikely that a
 
03:52:02.469 --> 03:52:02.479 align:start position:0%

what they believe that a well-crafted
 
04:05:51.110 --> 04:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
message can accomplish this is evidenced
 
04:05:52.790 --> 04:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
by the existence of a multi-billion

hcr1 and abortion messaging in general
 
04:06:01.189 --> 04:06:01.199 align:start position:0%
gives us a master class in this with
 
04:06:03.429 --> 04:06:03.439 align:start position:0%
just a few simple phrases suborders have
 
04:06:05.229 --> 04:06:05.239 align:start position:0%
been able to effectively shape the
 
04:06:07.309 --> 04:06:07.319 align:start position:0%
conversation and in many cases have
 
04:06:09.269 --> 04:06:09.279 align:start position:0%
captured people's imagination around
 
04:06:12.590 --> 04:06:12.600 align:start position:0%
this issue for example they say that
 
04:06:15.110 --> 04:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
abortion is safe essential reproductive
 
04:06:17.510 --> 04:06:17.520 align:start position:0%

between a mother and her
 
04:06:21.070 --> 04:06:21.080 align:start position:0%
physician these are all attractive
 
04:06:22.710 --> 04:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
propositions that when taken at face
 
04:06:25.469 --> 04:06:25.479 align:start position:0%
value I would agree with wouldn't
 
04:06:28.750 --> 04:06:28.760 align:start position:0%
you now as this resolution puts it
 
04:06:30.750 --> 04:06:30.760 align:start position:0%
abortion is essential to protecting an
 
04:06:32.269 --> 04:06:32.279 align:start position:0%
individual's freedom to control their
 
04:06:35.830 --> 04:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
own body life and future it's an
 
04:06:38.309 --> 04:06:38.319 align:start position:0%
appealing conceit that uh one could
 
04:06:40.149 --> 04:06:40.159 align:start position:0%
actually control these things after all
 
04:06:42.389 --> 04:06:42.399 align:start position:0%
life is full of dangers and difficulties
 
04:06:44.750 --> 04:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
it's riddled by fears and uncertainty
 
04:06:47.790 --> 04:06:47.800 align:start position:0%
and in it there is no lack of pain toil
 
04:06:47.800 --> 04:06:48.630 align:start position:0%
and in it there is no lack of pain toil
or

04:06:48.630 --> 04:06:48.640 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:06:51.110 --> 04:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
tragedy if abortion could actually
 
04:06:53.750 --> 04:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
eliminate these problems then abortion
 
04:06:55.269 --> 04:06:55.279 align:start position:0%
would afford a kind of freedom to those
 
04:06:57.349 --> 04:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
who get one that has otherwise been
 
04:06:58.870 --> 04:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
unknown to
 
04:07:01.429 --> 04:07:01.439 align:start position:0%
mankind without question abortion would
 
04:07:04.790 --> 04:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
not only be a good but one might argue
 
04:07:06.710 --> 04:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
it would even border on the
 
04:07:09.670 --> 04:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
miraculous so if that was the actual
 
04:07:11.950 --> 04:07:11.960 align:start position:0%
reality of abortion then I wouldn't
 
04:07:11.960 --> 04:07:13.189 align:start position:0%
reality of abortion then I wouldn't
oppose

04:07:13.189 --> 04:07:13.199 align:start position:0%
oppose
 
04:07:16.349 --> 04:07:16.359 align:start position:0%
it however I've never been able to shake
 
04:07:17.870 --> 04:07:17.880 align:start position:0%
off the idea that these statements do
 
04:07:19.670 --> 04:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
not accurately reflect what an abortion
 
04:07:22.630 --> 04:07:22.640 align:start position:0%
is that perhaps these phrases are simply
 
04:07:22.640 --> 04:07:23.550 align:start position:0%
is that perhaps these phrases are simply
empty

04:07:23.550 --> 04:07:23.560 align:start position:0%
empty
 
04:07:25.830 --> 04:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
platitudes for amidst all the carefully
 
04:07:28.550 --> 04:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
crafted language of hcr1 a document that
 
04:07:30.429 --> 04:07:30.439 align:start position:0%
is designed to appeal to our sense of
 
04:07:33.070 --> 04:07:33.080 align:start position:0%
empathy and fairness it seems to me that
 
04:07:34.710 --> 04:07:34.720 align:start position:0%
there is very one very small but
 
04:07:37.750 --> 04:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
significant detail missing the direct
 
04:07:38.790 --> 04:07:38.800 align:start position:0%
object of the
 
04:07:41.109 --> 04:07:41.119 align:start position:0%
abortion the human
 
04:07:44.469 --> 04:07:44.479 align:start position:0%
child the human child that is the result
 
04:07:46.990 --> 04:07:47.000 align:start position:0%
of the reproduction that has already
 
04:07:49.269 --> 04:07:49.279 align:start position:0%
occurred so if a human child is the
 
04:07:51.510 --> 04:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
result of reproduction and abortion is
 
04:07:53.030 --> 04:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
the ending of that very same
 
04:07:54.830 --> 04:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
reproduction then I'm left with this
 
04:07:54.840 --> 04:07:55.990 align:start position:0%
reproduction then I'm left with this
haunting

04:07:55.990 --> 04:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
haunting
 
04:07:58.389 --> 04:07:58.399 align:start position:0%
thought are we killing innocent human
 
04:08:00.109 --> 04:08:00.119 align:start position:0%
children to solve our
 
04:08:02.790 --> 04:08:02.800 align:start position:0%
problems are we killing innocent human
 
04:08:04.990 --> 04:08:05.000 align:start position:0%
children to mitigate the dangers and
 
04:08:06.670 --> 04:08:06.680 align:start position:0%
difficulties of Life are we killing
 
04:08:08.550 --> 04:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
innocent children to assuage our fears
 
04:08:10.109 --> 04:08:10.119 align:start position:0%
and uncertainties are we killing
 
04:08:11.309 --> 04:08:11.319 align:start position:0%
innocent children under the
 
04:08:13.109 --> 04:08:13.119 align:start position:0%
misconception that it has the power to
 
04:08:15.189 --> 04:08:15.199 align:start position:0%
remove pain and toil from our
 
04:08:18.510 --> 04:08:18.520 align:start position:0%
futures Mr Speaker I'm convinced that
 
04:08:20.950 --> 04:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
the answer to these questions is a
 
04:08:23.830 --> 04:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
resounding yes when I look at this
 
04:08:25.670 --> 04:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
resolution every word seems to confirm
 
04:08:28.349 --> 04:08:28.359 align:start position:0%
it it jumps out at me from every line
 
04:08:30.550 --> 04:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
one of the central tenants of hdr1 seems
 
04:08:32.349 --> 04:08:32.359 align:start position:0%
to be that abortion is necessary to
 
04:08:34.790 --> 04:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
avoid poverty and hardship and ensure an
 
04:08:37.389 --> 04:08:37.399 align:start position:0%
unencumbered life defined by Pleasure
 
04:08:39.070 --> 04:08:39.080 align:start position:0%
even even if this were true which it
 
04:08:41.790 --> 04:08:41.800 align:start position:0%
isn't tell me is this all that it means
 
04:08:44.309 --> 04:08:44.319 align:start position:0%
to be human looking into our past
 
04:08:45.550 --> 04:08:45.560 align:start position:0%
starting with our own parents and
 
04:08:47.229 --> 04:08:47.239 align:start position:0%
Tracing Our Family Lines back to the
 
04:08:49.349 --> 04:08:49.359 align:start position:0%
dawn of humanity is there anyone here
 
04:08:51.630 --> 04:08:51.640 align:start position:0%
who can say with any level of confidence
 
04:08:53.189 --> 04:08:53.199 align:start position:0%
that there was no one in your family
 
04:08:55.710 --> 04:08:55.720 align:start position:0%
history who ever endured poverty so that
 
04:08:56.990 --> 04:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
you could be here
 
04:08:59.550 --> 04:08:59.560 align:start position:0%
today that none of them ever sacrificed
 
04:09:01.149 --> 04:09:01.159 align:start position:0%
when it was inconvenient that none of
 
04:09:03.149 --> 04:09:03.159 align:start position:0%
them delayed pleasure or for seasons of
 
04:09:04.710 --> 04:09:04.720 align:start position:0%
their life encumbered themselves for the
 
04:09:05.950 --> 04:09:05.960 align:start position:0%
sake of their
 
04:09:08.349 --> 04:09:08.359 align:start position:0%
descendants aren't we Greatful ful for
 
04:09:10.590 --> 04:09:10.600 align:start position:0%
this don't we honor them for the
 
04:09:12.590 --> 04:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
sacrifices that they made of which we
 
04:09:13.870 --> 04:09:13.880 align:start position:0%
are the
 
04:09:16.070 --> 04:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries don't we owe this same
 
04:09:19.469 --> 04:09:19.479 align:start position:0%
life-giving selflessness to the Next
 
04:09:22.070 --> 04:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
Generation but some will say surely
 
04:09:24.070 --> 04:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
these people are too little to actually
 
04:09:28.109 --> 04:09:28.119 align:start position:0%
be people then let me ask you when do we
 
04:09:30.950 --> 04:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
come when do we become people when do we
 
04:09:32.830 --> 04:09:32.840 align:start position:0%
cease to be a potential medical
 
04:09:34.389 --> 04:09:34.399 align:start position:0%
procedure for our
 
04:09:38.510 --> 04:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
mothers Mr Speaker here is what I know
 
04:09:40.070 --> 04:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
I know that when my father's sperm and
 
04:09:41.510 --> 04:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
my mother's egg connected in that
 
04:09:43.950 --> 04:09:43.960 align:start position:0%
literal flash of light my life began
 
04:09:46.149 --> 04:09:46.159 align:start position:0%
just as yours did for you did it
 
04:09:48.790 --> 04:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
not if within weeks of that moment your
 
04:09:50.790 --> 04:09:50.800 align:start position:0%
light had been snuffed out what would
 
04:09:53.349 --> 04:09:53.359 align:start position:0%
that have meant for you would you have
 
04:09:55.670 --> 04:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
just been put on some sort of pause as
 
04:09:57.149 --> 04:09:57.159 align:start position:0%
though ready to join the world people
 
04:09:59.309 --> 04:09:59.319 align:start position:0%
suddenly told you oh not yet we're not
 
04:10:01.790 --> 04:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
ready for you yet so you simply hung
 
04:10:02.950 --> 04:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
around the waiting room until your
 
04:10:04.349 --> 04:10:04.359 align:start position:0%
mother got pregnant again at a
 
04:10:04.359 --> 04:10:05.630 align:start position:0%
mother got pregnant again at a
convenient

04:10:05.630 --> 04:10:05.640 align:start position:0%
convenient
 
04:10:08.229 --> 04:10:08.239 align:start position:0%
time or would you just be
 
04:10:10.269 --> 04:10:10.279 align:start position:0%
de the next time your mother got
 
04:10:11.870 --> 04:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
pregnant if we sought for you would we
 
04:10:14.189 --> 04:10:14.199 align:start position:0%
have found you or would the child who

emerged from the womb be a totally
 
04:10:16.720 --> 04:10:18.389 align:start position:0%
emerged from the womb be a totally
different

04:10:18.389 --> 04:10:18.399 align:start position:0%
different
 
04:10:20.910 --> 04:10:20.920 align:start position:0%
person I do not oppose abortion out of
 
04:10:22.950 --> 04:10:22.960 align:start position:0%
any desire to control women's bodies or
 
04:10:24.710 --> 04:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
to insert myself into the legitimate
 
04:10:26.670 --> 04:10:26.680 align:start position:0%
medical decisions that occur between a
 
04:10:27.830 --> 04:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
woman and her
 
04:10:30.070 --> 04:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
doctor but I will stand up and speak
 
04:10:31.790 --> 04:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
when I read that 5 million women have
 
04:10:34.149 --> 04:10:34.159 align:start position:0%
used this abortion medication which the
 
04:10:35.630 --> 04:10:35.640 align:start position:0%
resolution describes as safe and
 
04:10:37.710 --> 04:10:37.720 align:start position:0%
effective and I know it has caused the
 
04:10:39.630 --> 04:10:39.640 align:start position:0%
death of at least one person every time
 
04:10:42.189 --> 04:10:42.199 align:start position:0%
it has been used when I know in fact
 
04:10:43.710 --> 04:10:43.720 align:start position:0%
that that is its very
 
04:10:46.030 --> 04:10:46.040 align:start position:0%
purpose I stand up here knowing that I
 
04:10:47.429 --> 04:10:47.439 align:start position:0%
will once again have to endure cold
 
04:10:50.750 --> 04:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
shoulders eye rolls angry tweets
 
04:10:52.389 --> 04:10:52.399 align:start position:0%
character assassination attempts and
 
04:10:54.910 --> 04:10:54.920 align:start position:0%
calls from my seat but these things are
 
04:10:57.349 --> 04:10:57.359 align:start position:0%
less than nothing to me because when I
 
04:10:58.910 --> 04:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
look into the depth of my daughter's
 
04:11:00.950 --> 04:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
eyes I see my children's Children's
 
04:11:03.070 --> 04:11:03.080 align:start position:0%
children's children and with them
 
04:11:06.429 --> 04:11:06.439 align:start position:0%
myriads of others Mr Speaker I can see
 
04:11:09.349 --> 04:11:09.359 align:start position:0%
them but not now now I can behold them
 
04:11:11.670 --> 04:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
but not near nevertheless the glory of
 
04:11:13.510 --> 04:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
God their creator shines upon them from
 
04:11:15.269 --> 04:11:15.279 align:start position:0%
generation to generation and in the
 
04:11:19.550 --> 04:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
warmth of his love and light I love them
 
04:11:21.910 --> 04:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
so I
 
04:11:24.309 --> 04:11:24.319 align:start position:0%
stand Mr Speaker as a member of this
 
04:11:25.910 --> 04:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
house and therefore as a person who has
 
04:11:27.950 --> 04:11:27.960 align:start position:0%
been endowed with authority and Mr
 
04:11:29.429 --> 04:11:29.439 align:start position:0%
Speaker as someone who has been asked to
 
04:11:31.710 --> 04:11:31.720 align:start position:0%
give my support to a resolution that
 
04:11:33.790 --> 04:11:33.800 align:start position:0%
calls it a good to direct the power of
 
04:11:36.109 --> 04:11:36.119 align:start position:0%
the sword in the form of a pill against
 
04:11:38.229 --> 04:11:38.239 align:start position:0%
those of us too young to have ever done
 
04:11:40.309 --> 04:11:40.319 align:start position:0%
anything good or evil paying the price
 
04:11:42.149 --> 04:11:42.159 align:start position:0%
for our problems with their lives will
 
04:11:44.830 --> 04:11:44.840 align:start position:0%
we declare without equivocation or shame
 
04:11:46.910 --> 04:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
that we will build a better world on the
 
04:11:48.469 --> 04:11:48.479 align:start position:0%
mountain of their dead
 
04:11:51.830 --> 04:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
bodies what choice do I have Mr Speaker
 
04:11:55.189 --> 04:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
other than to ethically and emphatically
 
04:11:57.830 --> 04:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
vote no I urge my colleagues to press
 
04:11:59.750 --> 04:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
the red button that a better motion be
 
04:12:06.269 --> 04:12:06.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:06.279 --> 04:12:07.870 align:start position:0%
 
Simpson

04:12:07.870 --> 04:12:07.880 align:start position:0%
Simpson
 
04:12:10.990 --> 04:12:11.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker I rise in support
 
04:12:14.070 --> 04:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
of hcr1 a resolution condemning
 
04:12:16.790 --> 04:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
medically unnecessary restrictions on
 
04:12:20.030 --> 04:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
mistone the first pill of medication
 
04:12:23.349 --> 04:12:23.359 align:start position:0%
abortion in 1991 New Hampshire was the
 
04:12:25.389 --> 04:12:25.399 align:start position:0%
first state in the country to pass a
 
04:12:27.510 --> 04:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
resolution which was also
 
04:12:31.269 --> 04:12:31.279 align:start position:0%
hcr1 urging the usfda to conduct
 
04:12:33.870 --> 04:12:33.880 align:start position:0%
clinical trials on mistone and to
 
04:12:36.109 --> 04:12:36.119 align:start position:0%
encourage its use due to the significant
 
04:12:37.870 --> 04:12:37.880 align:start position:0%
medical value
 
04:12:40.469 --> 04:12:40.479 align:start position:0%
this was a bipartisan vote because as we
 
04:12:42.750 --> 04:12:42.760 align:start position:0%
know New Hampshire has enjoyed for so
 
04:12:45.710 --> 04:12:45.720 align:start position:0%
long broad bipartisan support for
 
04:12:48.109 --> 04:12:48.119 align:start position:0%
abortion I introduced this resolution
 
04:12:49.790 --> 04:12:49.800 align:start position:0%
because of the significant threat we
 
04:12:52.109 --> 04:12:52.119 align:start position:0%
face right now as a country including
 
04:12:54.910 --> 04:12:54.920 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire the US Supreme
 
04:12:57.590 --> 04:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
Court has its first abortion case since
 
04:12:59.910 --> 04:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
they overturned roie Wade and the
 
04:13:02.830 --> 04:13:02.840 align:start position:0%
decision is expected in June the case
 
04:13:04.910 --> 04:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
was brought forward by anti-abortion
 
04:13:07.750 --> 04:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
activists and could remove m stoned from
 
04:13:10.189 --> 04:13:10.199 align:start position:0%
the market everywhere including in
 
04:13:12.349 --> 04:13:12.359 align:start position:0%
states where abortion is legal like here
 
04:13:13.229 --> 04:13:13.239 align:start position:0%
in New
 
04:13:15.950 --> 04:13:15.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the case ignores science and
 
04:13:19.469 --> 04:13:19.479 align:start position:0%
is entirely based on anti-abortion bias
 
04:13:21.990 --> 04:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
in fact just last week two studies cited
 
04:13:24.950 --> 04:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
as justification to restrict mistone
 
04:13:24.960 --> 04:13:26.149 align:start position:0%
as justification to restrict mistone
were

04:13:26.149 --> 04:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
were
 
04:13:29.030 --> 04:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
retracted here are the facts since the
 
04:13:32.590 --> 04:13:32.600 align:start position:0%
FDA approved mistone over 20 years ago 5
 
04:13:34.510 --> 04:13:34.520 align:start position:0%
million people in the United States have
 
04:13:38.149 --> 04:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
used mistone a prescribed drug a
 
04:13:41.189 --> 04:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
prescribed drug for a variety of
 
04:13:44.149 --> 04:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
purposes mistone is the first pill of
 
04:13:46.389 --> 04:13:46.399 align:start position:0%
medication abortion and is only
 
04:13:49.510 --> 04:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
available up until the 11th week of a
 
04:13:52.429 --> 04:13:52.439 align:start position:0%
pregnancy mistone is also used for
 
04:13:55.189 --> 04:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
miscarriage management we continue to
 
04:13:57.670 --> 04:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
hear stories of women in states where
 
04:14:00.269 --> 04:14:00.279 align:start position:0%
abortion is banned being unable to get
 
04:14:02.710 --> 04:14:02.720 align:start position:0%
miscarriage care because the medication
 
04:14:05.630 --> 04:14:05.640 align:start position:0%
mistone is the same one that is used for
 
04:14:07.870 --> 04:14:07.880 align:start position:0%
abortion we should not have Granite
 
04:14:10.710 --> 04:14:10.720 align:start position:0%
Staters facing those same
 
04:14:13.710 --> 04:14:13.720 align:start position:0%
threats another use of myth aistone the
 
04:14:15.630 --> 04:14:15.640 align:start position:0%
one mentioned in a committee report as
 
04:14:17.309 --> 04:14:17.319 align:start position:0%
something we can all agree on for
 
04:14:21.149 --> 04:14:21.159 align:start position:0%
today's vote is for ectopic
 
04:14:23.429 --> 04:14:23.439 align:start position:0%
pregnancies but I want to be clear the
 
04:14:25.590 --> 04:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
US Supreme Court's upcoming decision
 
04:14:29.910 --> 04:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
will impact M mistone overall not pick
 
04:14:32.550 --> 04:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
and choose which medical procedures are
 
04:14:34.910 --> 04:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
available in other words patients who
 
04:14:37.149 --> 04:14:37.159 align:start position:0%
have an ectopic pregnancy can be
 
04:14:39.510 --> 04:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
affected by the Supreme Court
 
04:14:43.189 --> 04:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
case Mya prisone is extremely safe safer
 
04:14:46.349 --> 04:14:46.359 align:start position:0%
than Tylenol for example it is effective
 
04:14:48.229 --> 04:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
and its approval should not be affected
 
04:14:50.349 --> 04:14:50.359 align:start position:0%
by the whims of Bad actors across the
 
04:14:53.030 --> 04:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
country we should oppose these tactics
 
04:14:56.309 --> 04:14:56.319 align:start position:0%
to pass a deao nationwide abortion ban
 
04:14:58.750 --> 04:14:58.760 align:start position:0%
if mistone is banned the results could
 
04:15:00.710 --> 04:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
have major implications that go far
 
04:15:03.590 --> 04:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
beyond abortion care we should all be
 
04:15:05.830 --> 04:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
able to agree that one judge in Texas
 
04:15:07.429 --> 04:15:07.439 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have the authority to
 
04:15:10.229 --> 04:15:10.239 align:start position:0%
undermine the entire drug approval
 
04:15:13.030 --> 04:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
system we have the opportunity today to
 
04:15:15.590 --> 04:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
send a message to Washington but even
 
04:15:18.189 --> 04:15:18.199 align:start position:0%
more important to send a message to our
 
04:15:20.309 --> 04:15:20.319 align:start position:0%
constituents where do we as the New
 
04:15:22.830 --> 04:15:22.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire house stand on medication
 
04:15:25.830 --> 04:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
abortion do we support abortion early in
 
04:15:28.429 --> 04:15:28.439 align:start position:0%
pregnancy specifically abortion up until
 
04:15:32.030 --> 04:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
the 11th week if we do the vote is easy
 
04:15:34.269 --> 04:15:34.279 align:start position:0%
and we pass this resolution in a strong
 
04:15:34.279 --> 04:15:35.469 align:start position:0%
and we pass this resolution in a strong
bipartisan

04:15:35.469 --> 04:15:35.479 align:start position:0%
bipartisan
 
04:15:37.630 --> 04:15:37.640 align:start position:0%
vote I've heard many many colleagues
 
04:15:39.670 --> 04:15:39.680 align:start position:0%
speak about our current abortion ban
 
04:15:42.389 --> 04:15:42.399 align:start position:0%
promising not to change it today all of
 
04:15:44.510 --> 04:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
us can demonstrate that we will fight
 
04:15:46.550 --> 04:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
against restrictions on abortion early
 
04:15:49.189 --> 04:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
in pregnancy we can show that we'll do
 
04:15:51.670 --> 04:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
everything in our power as a legislature
 
04:15:53.910 --> 04:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
to protect Granite State patients who
 
04:15:56.429 --> 04:15:56.439 align:start position:0%

asked every year to shoulder a heavier
 
04:38:22.310 --> 04:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
tax burden for their schools need to be
 
04:38:25.670 --> 04:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
able to trust these
 
04:38:28.029 --> 04:38:28.039 align:start position:0%
institutions many districts have a
 
04:38:31.029 --> 04:38:31.039 align:start position:0%
reconsideration policy but this bill
 
04:38:34.429 --> 04:38:34.439 align:start position:0%
would allow a neutral set of eyes to
 
04:38:38.189 --> 04:38:38.199 align:start position:0%
consider an appeal from parents I urge
 
04:38:41.189 --> 04:38:41.199 align:start position:0%
you to support it and Mr Speaker I
 
04:38:43.310 --> 04:38:43.320 align:start position:0%

Speaker if I look around this
 
04:40:59.788 --> 04:40:59.798 align:start position:0%
chamber at my colleagues of all
 
04:40:59.798 --> 04:41:00.708 align:start position:0%

04:41:00.708 --> 04:41:00.718 align:start position:0%
political
 
04:41:03.750 --> 04:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
stripes and believe that no member of
 
04:41:05.310 --> 04:41:05.320 align:start position:0%
this body
 
04:41:08.230 --> 04:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
supports the dissemination of harmful
 
04:41:11.110 --> 04:41:11.120 align:start position:0%
materials to our
 
04:41:14.868 --> 04:41:14.878 align:start position:0%
children but if I know that this
 
04:41:18.788 --> 04:41:18.798 align:start position:0%
bill creates a vague standard for
 
04:41:21.830 --> 04:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
defining obscenity using highly
 
04:41:26.030 --> 04:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
subjective determinations of materials
 
04:41:29.230 --> 04:41:29.240 align:start position:0%
appropriateness and if I understand that
 
04:41:33.628 --> 04:41:33.638 align:start position:0%
this bill is built around a fundamental
 
04:41:36.270 --> 04:41:36.280 align:start position:0%
contradiction that we Define the term
 
04:41:39.230 --> 04:41:39.240 align:start position:0%
harmful to minors based on prevailing
 
04:41:39.240 --> 04:41:40.510 align:start position:0%
harmful to minors based on prevailing
Community

04:41:40.510 --> 04:41:40.520 align:start position:0%
Community
 
04:41:43.470 --> 04:41:43.480 align:start position:0%
standards but that our locally elected
 
04:41:46.270 --> 04:41:46.280 align:start position:0%
boards who are accountable to their
 
04:41:50.230 --> 04:41:50.240 align:start position:0%
voters at The Ballot Box no longer have
 
04:41:53.788 --> 04:41:53.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:56.948 --> 04:41:56.958 align:start position:0%
here Mr Speaker if I believe that it is
 
04:42:00.470 --> 04:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
entirely inappropriate that a group of
 
04:42:03.190 --> 04:42:03.200 align:start position:0%
political appointees on the State Board
 
04:42:06.868 --> 04:42:06.878 align:start position:0%
of Education get to tell my community
 
04:42:10.750 --> 04:42:10.760 align:start position:0%
what our own Community standards
 
04:42:13.990 --> 04:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
are and finally Mr Speaker if I know
 
04:42:16.470 --> 04:42:16.480 align:start position:0%
that this body will have the opportunity
 
04:42:18.910 --> 04:42:18.920 align:start position:0%
to consider bipartisan
 
04:42:21.948 --> 04:42:21.958 align:start position:0%
legislation that addresses the concerns
 
04:42:24.430 --> 04:42:24.440 align:start position:0%
around due process for parents raising
 
04:42:28.470 --> 04:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
concerns while still preserving local
 
04:42:31.590 --> 04:42:31.600 align:start position:0%
control then would I press the red
 
04:42:34.830 --> 04:42:34.840 align:start position:0%
button so a better motion may be made
 
04:42:34.840 --> 04:42:35.590 align:start position:0%
button so a better motion may be made
thank

04:42:35.590 --> 04:42:35.600 align:start position:0%

04:42:49.190 --> 04:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr
 
04:42:52.270 --> 04:42:52.280 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that HB
 
04:42:54.788 --> 04:42:54.798 align:start position:0%
1419 has been
 
04:42:57.868 --> 04:42:57.878 align:start position:0%
misrepresented as a book Banning bill
 
04:43:00.550 --> 04:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
because real book Banning involves the
 
04:43:02.430 --> 04:43:02.440 align:start position:0%
government completely suppressing
 
04:43:04.868 --> 04:43:04.878 align:start position:0%
material and making it unobtainable by
 
04:43:08.030 --> 04:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
anyone anywhere something that this bill
 
04:43:12.310 --> 04:43:12.320 align:start position:0%
does not do if I know that hb1 1419
 
04:43:15.628 --> 04:43:15.638 align:start position:0%
employs an objective standard for
 
04:43:18.030 --> 04:43:18.040 align:start position:0%
identifying materials that are harmful
 
04:43:21.350 --> 04:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
to Miners and that this legal precedent
 
04:43:23.230 --> 04:43:23.240 align:start position:0%
provides clear guidelines that have been
 
04:43:26.590 --> 04:43:26.600 align:start position:0%
used in courts for over 50 years and
 
04:43:28.788 --> 04:43:28.798 align:start position:0%
that this bill also includes a minimum
 
04:43:32.948 --> 04:43:32.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:36.230 --> 04:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
material if I I was
 
04:43:38.670 --> 04:43:38.680 align:start position:0%
disturbed by the
 
04:43:41.110 --> 04:43:41.120 align:start position:0%
examples that have been
 
04:43:43.510 --> 04:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
given and the words that were just read
 
04:43:46.310 --> 04:43:46.320 align:start position:0%
from books currently held in public
 
04:43:49.910 --> 04:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
school libraries if I know that students
 
04:43:53.110 --> 04:43:53.120 align:start position:0%
go to school to learn and if I believe
 
04:43:55.270 --> 04:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
that they learn nothing of any value
 
04:43:56.750 --> 04:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
from this type of
 
04:43:59.948 --> 04:43:59.958 align:start position:0%
material would I now protect Children's
 
04:44:02.990 --> 04:44:03.000 align:start position:0%

liquefied natural gas from LNG it's the
 
04:49:34.470 --> 04:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
only place that New England can get it
 
04:49:36.910 --> 04:49:36.920 align:start position:0%
from and that terminal in Everett looks
 
04:49:38.270 --> 04:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
like it's going to stay open for quite
 
04:49:40.708 --> 04:49:40.718 align:start position:0%
some time now but it has to get filled
 
04:49:43.150 --> 04:49:43.160 align:start position:0%
the problem is because of the Jones act
 
04:49:45.590 --> 04:49:45.600 align:start position:0%
we can only get it from one place if
 
04:49:47.190 --> 04:49:47.200 align:start position:0%
there was no Jones act we could get
 
04:49:50.110 --> 04:49:50.120 align:start position:0%
domestic LNG from Maryland much shorter
 
04:49:52.270 --> 04:49:52.280 align:start position:0%
trip it would cost less money or we
 
04:49:53.830 --> 04:49:53.840 align:start position:0%
could get it from the Gulf Coast where
 
04:49:58.150 --> 04:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
again domestic uh LNG uh and it would be
 
04:50:00.030 --> 04:50:00.040 align:start position:0%
a plentiful Supply that we could get
 
04:50:01.830 --> 04:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
huge amounts of not never having to
 
04:50:04.948 --> 04:50:04.958 align:start position:0%
worry about a supply issue but the Jones
 
04:50:07.910 --> 04:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
act says this doesn't work it has to be
 
04:50:10.070 --> 04:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
a spefic specific ship built in the
 
04:50:12.470 --> 04:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
United States and manned by American
 
04:50:14.590 --> 04:50:14.600 align:start position:0%
Crews and they just do not exist there's
 
04:50:17.190 --> 04:50:17.200 align:start position:0%
no option here they do not exist and no
 
04:50:18.990 --> 04:50:19.000 align:start position:0%
one's going to build one just to bring
 
04:50:21.628 --> 04:50:21.638 align:start position:0%
LNG to New England so if something
 
04:50:23.990 --> 04:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
happens to Trinidad and Tobago in the
 
04:50:27.110 --> 04:50:27.120 align:start position:0%
winter and we have a severe cold snap we
 
04:50:29.470 --> 04:50:29.480 align:start position:0%
might not be able to get our LNG and
 
04:50:31.708 --> 04:50:31.718 align:start position:0%
that means we could have blackouts so
 
04:50:33.270 --> 04:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
your electric rates are already higher
 
04:50:35.030 --> 04:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
because of the Jones act you could have
 
04:50:37.030 --> 04:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
blackouts because of the Jones act and
 
04:50:39.470 --> 04:50:39.480 align:start position:0%
to show how serious this is last year
 
04:50:41.910 --> 04:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
all six New England Governors Democrat
 
04:50:44.030 --> 04:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
and Republican alike asked for a waiver
 
04:50:46.190 --> 04:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
on the Jones act for the winter so they
 
04:50:48.390 --> 04:50:48.400 align:start position:0%
could get LNG from other sources the
 
04:50:50.270 --> 04:50:50.280 align:start position:0%
Biden Administration turned that down
 
04:50:51.990 --> 04:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
but the six Governors thought it was
 
04:50:54.190 --> 04:50:54.200 align:start position:0%
important enough to ask for a waiver so
 
04:50:55.868 --> 04:50:55.878 align:start position:0%
that's just a small example of how the
 
04:50:58.670 --> 04:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
Jones act cost everyone in New England a
 
04:51:02.750 --> 04:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:12.310 --> 04:51:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:16.230 --> 04:51:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:19.830 --> 04:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
Speaker I unfortunately uh cannot agree
 
04:51:23.350 --> 04:51:23.360 align:start position:0%
with a not to pass and I'll tell you why
 
04:51:25.270 --> 04:51:25.280 align:start position:0%
and I'll make it simple there are sort
 
04:51:28.548 --> 04:51:28.558 align:start position:0%
of three points that are important to me
 
04:51:30.868 --> 04:51:30.878 align:start position:0%
and I realized we just had a discussion
 
04:51:33.310 --> 04:51:33.320 align:start position:0%
about the national impact of the Jones
 
04:51:37.830 --> 04:51:37.840 align:start position:0%
act which which requires us to buy
 
04:51:41.670 --> 04:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
americanmade American crude and American
 
04:51:41.680 --> 04:51:43.270 align:start position:0%
americanmade American crude and American
owned

04:51:43.270 --> 04:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
owned
 
04:51:46.590 --> 04:51:46.600 align:start position:0%
ships because of National Security
 
04:51:48.868 --> 04:51:48.878 align:start position:0%
concerns which were detailed in the
 
04:51:52.830 --> 04:51:52.840 align:start position:0%
original um act in 1920 which is still
 
04:51:56.350 --> 04:51:56.360 align:start position:0%
in force today but I'm going to look at
 
04:51:57.990 --> 04:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
how this impacts New Hampshire because
 
04:51:59.708 --> 04:51:59.718 align:start position:0%
I'm a New Hampshire state representative
 
04:52:02.070 --> 04:52:02.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not a congressional representative
 
04:52:04.430 --> 04:52:04.440 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
04:52:07.590 --> 04:52:07.600 align:start position:0%
although this creates 650,000 jobs
 
04:52:10.548 --> 04:52:10.558 align:start position:0%
Nationwide in New Hampshire it creates
 
04:52:14.470 --> 04:52:14.480 align:start position:0%
1,210 jobs these are good paying jobs
 
04:52:16.708 --> 04:52:16.718 align:start position:0%
people can afford to buy homes and raise
 
04:52:20.510 --> 04:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
families on these jobs secondly it
 
04:52:24.190 --> 04:52:24.200 align:start position:0%
provides us with uh border
 
04:52:27.510 --> 04:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
security as you know having only
 
04:52:30.350 --> 04:52:30.360 align:start position:0%
americanmade American-owned American
 
04:52:33.910 --> 04:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
crew ships in our Inland Waters that
 
04:52:36.390 --> 04:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
provides us with a level of security and
 
04:52:38.350 --> 04:52:38.360 align:start position:0%
at breakfast today I had breakfast with
 
04:52:42.030 --> 04:52:42.040 align:start position:0%
a couple of folks from our Public Safety
 
04:52:44.788 --> 04:52:44.798 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire and they said
 
04:52:47.510 --> 04:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
given our current environment they would
 
04:52:47.520 --> 04:52:48.510 align:start position:0%
given our current environment they would
not

04:52:48.510 --> 04:52:48.520 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:52:51.628 --> 04:52:51.638 align:start position:0%
change the Jones
 
04:52:53.470 --> 04:52:53.480 align:start position:0%
act and
 
04:52:57.910 --> 04:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
finally it provides tax dollars and
 
04:53:00.948 --> 04:53:00.958 align:start position:0%
Industry to us and that's important too
 
04:53:03.350 --> 04:53:03.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire maid is important and I
 
04:53:05.590 --> 04:53:05.600 align:start position:0%
think if we learn nothing during covid
 
04:53:08.430 --> 04:53:08.440 align:start position:0%
we learn the importance of making things
 
04:53:09.788 --> 04:53:09.798 align:start position:0%
here at
 
04:53:13.628 --> 04:53:13.638 align:start position:0%
home so Mr Speaker I would ask you to
 
04:53:16.548 --> 04:53:16.558 align:start position:0%
stand up with me for New Hampshire jobs
 
04:53:18.868 --> 04:53:18.878 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire made and a strong New
 
04:53:21.390 --> 04:53:21.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire border thank you Mr
 
04:53:29.750 --> 04:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:31.868 --> 04:53:31.878 align:start position:0%
McGuire thank you Mr
 
04:53:35.030 --> 04:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
Speaker so we've heard bit that that
 
04:53:38.590 --> 04:53:38.600 align:start position:0%
this Jones act creates jobs or protects
 
04:53:41.150 --> 04:53:41.160 align:start position:0%
jobs well there's there's no trick in
 
04:53:45.110 --> 04:53:45.120 align:start position:0%
using the law to create and protect jobs
 
04:53:49.390 --> 04:53:49.400 align:start position:0%
if you're willing to force people to be
 
04:53:52.990 --> 04:53:53.000 align:start position:0%
inefficient in what they what they
 
04:53:54.910 --> 04:53:54.920 align:start position:0%
do for
 
04:53:59.190 --> 04:53:59.200 align:start position:0%
example um suppose I was to ban
 
04:54:01.510 --> 04:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
excavators that would create a huge
 
04:54:04.430 --> 04:54:04.440 align:start position:0%
number of jobs for guys with
 
04:54:04.440 --> 04:54:06.510 align:start position:0%
number of jobs for guys with
s

04:54:06.510 --> 04:54:06.520 align:start position:0%
s
 
04:54:10.548 --> 04:54:10.558 align:start position:0%
right so the Jones Act is the same thing
 
04:54:14.430 --> 04:54:14.440 align:start position:0%
we ban shiers from using their equipment
 
04:54:17.190 --> 04:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
as efficiently as it could be used from
 
04:54:20.110 --> 04:54:20.120 align:start position:0%
using their ships a simple example
 
04:54:24.030 --> 04:54:24.040 align:start position:0%
suppose a ship is is coming from Japan
 
04:54:28.310 --> 04:54:28.320 align:start position:0%
with with um uh containers goes to Los
 
04:54:30.270 --> 04:54:30.280 align:start position:0%
Angeles goes to San Francisco goes to
 
04:54:32.948 --> 04:54:32.958 align:start position:0%
Seattle goes back to Japan because of
 
04:54:35.868 --> 04:54:35.878 align:start position:0%
the Jones act when that ship drops off
 
04:54:39.390 --> 04:54:39.400 align:start position:0%
containers in Los Angeles it's not
 
04:54:41.590 --> 04:54:41.600 align:start position:0%
allowed to pick up a container that's
 
04:54:44.708 --> 04:54:44.718 align:start position:0%
going to San Francisco so it has to go
 
04:54:47.070 --> 04:54:47.080 align:start position:0%
partially empty to San Francisco it has
 
04:54:49.670 --> 04:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
to go even more empty to Seattle and
 
04:54:51.030 --> 04:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
then go back to
 
04:54:56.750 --> 04:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
Japan right that empty chip is
 
04:54:59.230 --> 04:54:59.240 align:start position:0%
inefficient um we heard that there there
 
04:55:01.910 --> 04:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
are jobs in New Hampshire I I really
 
04:55:05.868 --> 04:55:05.878 align:start position:0%
doubt that almost all Jones act ships
 
04:55:09.310 --> 04:55:09.320 align:start position:0%
are tugboats and riverg goinging
 
04:55:13.708 --> 04:55:13.718 align:start position:0%
ships right no large container ships
 
04:55:15.548 --> 04:55:15.558 align:start position:0%
none of none of that sort of thing is
 
04:55:18.670 --> 04:55:18.680 align:start position:0%
built in the United States anymore of
 
04:55:18.680 --> 04:55:19.590 align:start position:0%
built in the United States anymore of
the

04:55:19.590 --> 04:55:19.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:55:23.190 --> 04:55:23.200 align:start position:0%
600 uh liquefied natural gas ships that
 
04:55:25.390 --> 04:55:25.400 align:start position:0%
that we and New England need for our
 
04:55:26.990 --> 04:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
heat and our
 
04:55:29.390 --> 04:55:29.400 align:start position:0%
electricity none of them have been built
 
04:55:32.190 --> 04:55:32.200 align:start position:0%
in the United States and no natural gas
 
04:55:33.708 --> 04:55:33.718 align:start position:0%
ship has been built in the unit United
 
04:55:35.830 --> 04:55:35.840 align:start position:0%
States for 40
 
04:55:38.910 --> 04:55:38.920 align:start position:0%
years only about
 
04:55:43.470 --> 04:55:43.480 align:start position:0%
three um oceangoing uh ships are built
 
04:55:46.830 --> 04:55:46.840 align:start position:0%
under the Jones act every year and of
 
04:55:49.590 --> 04:55:49.600 align:start position:0%
the three shipyards that build them two
 
04:55:51.110 --> 04:55:51.120 align:start position:0%
are foreign
 
04:55:54.868 --> 04:55:54.878 align:start position:0%
owned I mean it's just silly
 
04:55:57.390 --> 04:55:57.400 align:start position:0%
um all
 
04:55:57.400 --> 04:56:01.948 align:start position:0%
um all
right

04:56:01.948 --> 04:56:01.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:05.788 --> 04:56:05.798 align:start position:0%
uh econom IST from the organization for
 
04:56:07.788 --> 04:56:07.798 align:start position:0%
economic cooperation and development
 
04:56:09.990 --> 04:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
these are very well-respected economists
 
04:56:10.000 --> 04:56:11.030 align:start position:0%
these are very well-respected economists
the

04:56:11.030 --> 04:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:56:14.708 --> 04:56:14.718 align:start position:0%
oecd predict that ending the Jones
 
04:56:19.070 --> 04:56:19.080 align:start position:0%
act would increase US economic input e
 
04:56:21.628 --> 04:56:21.638 align:start position:0%
economic output by
 
04:56:24.750 --> 04:56:24.760 align:start position:0%
$135 billion dollar a
 
04:56:29.030 --> 04:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
year so this is not minor stuff all
 
04:56:33.788 --> 04:56:33.798 align:start position:0%
right uh that includes a 71% increase in
 
04:56:36.510 --> 04:56:36.520 align:start position:0%
commercial ship
 
04:56:40.510 --> 04:56:40.520 align:start position:0%
building all right um as the
 
04:56:43.110 --> 04:56:43.120 align:start position:0%
representative uh mentioned this is not
 
04:56:45.070 --> 04:56:45.080 align:start position:0%
a partisan
 
04:56:48.150 --> 04:56:48.160 align:start position:0%
issue all the governors of New England
 
04:56:50.910 --> 04:56:50.920 align:start position:0%
three Democrats three Republicans wrote
 
04:56:53.868 --> 04:56:53.878 align:start position:0%
a letter to Energy Secretary
 
04:56:58.510 --> 04:56:58.520 align:start position:0%
grolm two 18 months ago asking for a
 
04:57:00.830 --> 04:57:00.840 align:start position:0%
suspension of the Jones
 
04:57:04.670 --> 04:57:04.680 align:start position:0%
act um to bring us more natural gas for
 
04:57:13.948 --> 04:57:13.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:17.350 --> 04:57:17.360 align:start position:0%
winter let's stand with those
 
04:57:19.110 --> 04:57:19.120 align:start position:0%
governors with
 
04:57:22.628 --> 04:57:22.638 align:start position:0%
Alaska whose Governor is required by law
 
04:57:26.628 --> 04:57:26.638 align:start position:0%
to Lobby Congress against the Jones
 
04:57:30.430 --> 04:57:30.440 align:start position:0%
act with Puerto Rico who required a
 
04:57:33.190 --> 04:57:33.200 align:start position:0%
suspension of the Jones act um after
 
04:57:36.350 --> 04:57:36.360 align:start position:0%
their hurricane so that they could get
 
04:57:38.708 --> 04:57:38.718 align:start position:0%
resupplied with
 
04:57:42.110 --> 04:57:42.120 align:start position:0%
Hawaii where a container going from Los
 
04:57:45.470 --> 04:57:45.480 align:start position:0%
Angeles to Hawaii cost 10 times more in

Jones act creates 1,200 Jobs Here in the

our state economy and Mr Speaker if I
 
05:00:04.350 --> 05:00:04.360 align:start position:0%
ever need to remind myself the
 
05:00:06.990 --> 05:00:07.000 align:start position:0%
importance of American ship building to
 
05:00:09.750 --> 05:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
this state all I need to do is look at
 
05:00:11.708 --> 05:00:11.718 align:start position:0%
our state flag and see the friger
 
05:00:14.750 --> 05:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
Raleigh in the docks in Portsmouth would
 
05:00:16.868 --> 05:00:16.878 align:start position:0%
I now push the red button so another
 
05:00:19.270 --> 05:00:19.280 align:start position:0%

05:00:21.510 --> 05:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
Speaker chair recogniz representative
 
05:00:26.830 --> 05:00:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:28.990 --> 05:00:29.000 align:start position:0%
inquiring thank you Mr
 
05:00:33.430 --> 05:00:33.440 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that in part due to
 
05:00:35.190 --> 05:00:35.200 align:start position:0%
the Jones
 
05:00:37.830 --> 05:00:37.840 align:start position:0%
act which is a protectionist measure
 
05:00:39.948 --> 05:00:39.958 align:start position:0%
that precludes competition that domestic
 
05:00:42.430 --> 05:00:42.440 align:start position:0%
ship building has become expensive and
 
05:00:47.030 --> 05:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
slow and if I know that our non-defense
 
05:00:50.548 --> 05:00:50.558 align:start position:0%
oceangoing vessel fleet has subsequently
 
05:00:54.670 --> 05:00:54.680 align:start position:0%
declined from around 200 ships in
 
05:00:59.030 --> 05:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
2000 to less than 100 ships
 
05:01:03.350 --> 05:01:03.360 align:start position:0%
today and that our US Navy has declined
 
05:01:07.470 --> 05:01:07.480 align:start position:0%
from around 400 ships to only 280 ships
 
05:01:10.948 --> 05:01:10.958 align:start position:0%
today while the red Chinese army or as
 
05:01:14.310 --> 05:01:14.320 align:start position:0%
you were while the red Chinese Navy now
 
05:01:18.470 --> 05:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
has around 500 ships and if I know that
 
05:01:20.868 --> 05:01:20.878 align:start position:0%
competition breeds Improvement and
 
05:01:24.110 --> 05:01:24.120 align:start position:0%
excellence and that a revitalized ship
 
05:01:26.470 --> 05:01:26.480 align:start position:0%
building is industry would create not
 
05:01:29.628 --> 05:01:29.638 align:start position:0%
lose it would create not lose jobs and
 
05:01:31.990 --> 05:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
finally if I know that the Jones act
 
05:01:33.390 --> 05:01:33.400 align:start position:0%
makes fuel
 
05:01:35.230 --> 05:01:35.240 align:start position:0%
and other products more expensive here
 
05:01:37.868 --> 05:01:37.878 align:start position:0%
in New England would I then press the
 
05:01:40.310 --> 05:01:40.320 align:start position:0%

05:01:43.708 --> 05:01:43.718 align:start position:0%

05:01:47.070 --> 05:01:47.080 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker uh this is the
 
05:06:09.548 --> 05:06:09.558 align:start position:0%
first time I've pulled a bill from
 
05:06:11.990 --> 05:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
consent so uh I appreciate everybody's
 
05:06:15.510 --> 05:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
Indulgence it's late so I'll be brief uh
 
05:06:18.110 --> 05:06:18.120 align:start position:0%
hb152 would add the mental health flag
 
05:06:20.390 --> 05:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
to the statutory list of flags that
 
05:06:22.670 --> 05:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
could be flown at the State House at the
 
05:06:25.670 --> 05:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
discretion of legislative leadership
 
05:06:27.708 --> 05:06:27.718 align:start position:0%
last year folks working in the Mental
 
05:06:29.708 --> 05:06:29.718 align:start position:0%
Health Community reached out to me to
 
05:06:31.270 --> 05:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
ask if the mental health flag could be
 
05:06:33.750 --> 05:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
flown at the State House on the 1st of
 
05:06:36.670 --> 05:06:36.680 align:start position:0%
May to kick off mental health month when
 
05:06:38.350 --> 05:06:38.360 align:start position:0%
I told them that the flag could not be
 
05:06:40.510 --> 05:06:40.520 align:start position:0%
flown because it was not on the statuto
 
05:06:43.070 --> 05:06:43.080 align:start position:0%
list of authorized Flags they responded
 
05:06:45.628 --> 05:06:45.638 align:start position:0%
by asking me if I could file this bill
 
05:06:48.670 --> 05:06:48.680 align:start position:0%
to add it to the list the bill was itl
 
05:06:51.190 --> 05:06:51.200 align:start position:0%
in committee due to logistic concerns
 
05:06:53.788 --> 05:06:53.798 align:start position:0%
and concerns that if we Grant statutory
 
05:06:55.990 --> 05:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
approval then it might open the door to
 
05:06:58.270 --> 05:06:58.280 align:start position:0%
a flood of similar requests and this is
 
05:07:01.110 --> 05:07:01.120 align:start position:0%
not the only flag bill that was ited um
 
05:07:02.788 --> 05:07:02.798 align:start position:0%
a bill recognizing the honor and
 
05:07:04.868 --> 05:07:04.878 align:start position:0%
Remembrance flag was also rejected for
 
05:07:07.150 --> 05:07:07.160 align:start position:0%
similar reason and it turns out that the
 
05:07:09.150 --> 05:07:09.160 align:start position:0%
committee deals with a lot of flag bills
 
05:07:11.430 --> 05:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
all the time and usually rejects them
 
05:07:14.270 --> 05:07:14.280 align:start position:0%
for the reasons that I just mentioned um
 
05:07:16.110 --> 05:07:16.120 align:start position:0%
and while both these bills did not get
 
05:07:17.990 --> 05:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
the favorable recommendation in
 
05:07:20.230 --> 05:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
committee I spoken to the chair and the
 
05:07:22.708 --> 05:07:22.718 align:start position:0%
ranking member of the committee and they
 
05:07:24.868 --> 05:07:24.878 align:start position:0%
feel that it's worth studying rather
 
05:07:27.470 --> 05:07:27.480 align:start position:0%
than saying no all the time um they
 
05:07:29.350 --> 05:07:29.360 align:start position:0%
agree that there has to be a workable
 
05:07:31.910 --> 05:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
way that we as a legislature can
 
05:07:33.830 --> 05:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
evaluate groups such as Gold Star
 
05:07:35.750 --> 05:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
Mothers veterans and members of the
 
05:07:37.350 --> 05:07:37.360 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Community to see if they
 
05:07:39.310 --> 05:07:39.320 align:start position:0%
are worthy of recognition by this
 
05:07:42.030 --> 05:07:42.040 align:start position:0%
legislature and how to tangibly express
 
05:07:44.150 --> 05:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
that recognition so I'd like to give
 
05:07:46.230 --> 05:07:46.240 align:start position:0%
them the opportunity to do that study I
 
05:07:47.868 --> 05:07:47.878 align:start position:0%
would therefore ask my colleagues to
 
05:07:50.430 --> 05:07:50.440 align:start position:0%
vote no on the itl motion so that a
 
05:07:52.670 --> 05:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
motion of interim study can be brought
 
05:07:54.470 --> 05:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
forward and we can hopefully find a path
 
05:07:56.948 --> 05:07:56.958 align:start position:0%
forward to recognizing worthy groups
 
05:07:59.230 --> 05:07:59.240 align:start position:0%
within our committee uh Community uh
 
05:08:01.750 --> 05:08:01.760 align:start position:0%

05:08:29.470 --> 05:08:29.480 align:start position:0%
hunt Okay um so uh uh as some of you
 
05:08:31.948 --> 05:08:31.958 align:start position:0%
might know I'm now U chairman of the
 
05:08:33.910 --> 05:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
history history Committee of the State
 
05:08:36.310 --> 05:08:36.320 align:start position:0%
House and the flag issue and what would
 
05:08:38.270 --> 05:08:38.280 align:start position:0%
happen the flag poll came to me and say
 
05:08:40.788 --> 05:08:40.798 align:start position:0%
how can we solve the problem of who
 
05:08:43.788 --> 05:08:43.798 align:start position:0%
should have the flags there and really
 
05:08:46.190 --> 05:08:46.200 align:start position:0%
the resolution is that unfortunately the
 
05:08:47.910 --> 05:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
the right way to do this is to bring
 
05:08:50.110 --> 05:08:50.120 align:start position:0%
this bill through the legislative
 
05:08:53.110 --> 05:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
process and that's why you have it here
 
05:08:55.868 --> 05:08:55.878 align:start position:0%
um we would like to find a way so that
 
05:08:57.750 --> 05:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
we can find more places for these flags
 
05:09:00.110 --> 05:09:00.120 align:start position:0%
to fly uh and there's this is not the
 
05:09:02.270 --> 05:09:02.280 align:start position:0%
only one there's a lot of them but it's
 
05:09:03.948 --> 05:09:03.958 align:start position:0%
this point in time I would urge you to
 
05:09:06.948 --> 05:09:06.958 align:start position:0%
