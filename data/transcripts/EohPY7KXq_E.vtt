discussions this last time uh we did get
 
00:06:59.869 --> 00:06:59.879 align:start position:0%
a letter from um a physician I believe
 
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
at Dartmouth um that really spoke more
 
00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
to the original Bill not the how it was
 
00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:07.160 align:start position:0%
supposed to be that amended version I
 
00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
have not seen any statistics that we
 
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
were told or anything was going to come
 
00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:14.680 align:start position:0%
did anybody else get any statistics from
 
00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:17.080 align:start position:0%
anyone no
 
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
statistics just opinions yep and um we
 
00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:24.120 align:start position:0%
do have I'm going to give um you all
 
00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:26.039 align:start position:0%
just like a couple minutes to look so if
 
00:07:27.749 --> 00:07:27.759 align:start position:0%
you look in your emails if you have it
 
00:07:30.029 --> 00:07:30.039 align:start position:0%
with you but um our our committee
 
00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:32.680 align:start position:0%
researcher did look at other states that
 
00:07:36.749 --> 00:07:36.759 align:start position:0%
have um the uh prenatal part of it in
 
00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:40.520 align:start position:0%
there and the substance abuse uh part of
 
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
that in there so we just have that can
 
00:07:45.189 --> 00:07:45.199 align:start position:0%
you get that on yours um representative
 
00:07:48.469 --> 00:07:48.479 align:start position:0%
Deon or do you need to borrow my
 
00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
computer um it came in from Kristen
 
00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:53.080 align:start position:0%
Grant um she should have just sent that
 
00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.110 align:start position:0%
Grant um she should have just sent that
this

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:55.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.510 align:start position:0%
this
morning

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:07:59.950 --> 00:07:59.960 align:start position:0%
Grant um and this is listed
 
00:08:01.869 --> 00:08:01.879 align:start position:0%
all of the
 
00:08:05.469 --> 00:08:05.479 align:start position:0%
um 17 states that that states yes that
 
00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
do have it um most of them are not as
 
00:08:11.469 --> 00:08:11.479 align:start position:0%
protective of mothers as what ours is so
 
00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
um but you can go ahead and kind of look
 
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:14.800 align:start position:0%
at those I think that was one of the
 
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:58.430 align:start position:0%
 
time

00:08:58.430 --> 00:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:58.430 --> 00:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:59.829 --> 00:09:59.839 align:start position:0%
that this is really
 
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:03.160 align:start position:0%
a strong bipartisan bill this bill
 
00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:07.480 align:start position:0%
originated from Senator Carson who is of
 
00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:10.360 align:start position:0%
course the Senate President that there's
 
00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:14.360 align:start position:0%
no Republican or Democrat this is a
 
00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
bipartisan bill that was worked on for
 
00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:20.200 align:start position:0%
months correct really years and was it
 
00:10:23.069 --> 00:10:23.079 align:start position:0%
weekly that that you they worked on this
 
00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:27.320 align:start position:0%
last year yes so for and weekly for
 
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
months so it's not like this is just
 
00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
some Fly by Night
 
00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:35.000 align:start position:0%
legislation that this is has been worked
 
00:10:37.509 --> 00:10:37.519 align:start position:0%
on and and is a
 
00:10:37.519 --> 00:10:39.030 align:start position:0%
on and and is a
bipartisan

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
bipartisan
 
00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.629 align:start position:0%
bipartisan
bill

00:10:40.629 --> 00:10:40.639 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:10:44.069 --> 00:10:44.079 align:start position:0%
um spearheaded by Senator Carson so I
 
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
just wanted to get that out there so
 
00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
that people aren't thinking this is a
 
00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:52.360 align:start position:0%
Democrat bill or Republican bill this is
 
00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:56.360 align:start position:0%
a very responsible bipartisan
 
00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:00.720 align:start position:0%
Bill to update the defin s in the child
 
00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.190 align:start position:0%
Bill to update the defin s in the child
protection

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:02.200 align:start position:0%
protection
 
00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
act does nothing else no there's no
 
00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
criminal penalties anywhere nothing this
 
00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:11.480 align:start position:0%
is just updating the child protection
 
00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:14.600 align:start position:0%
act to bring us in line really with a
 
00:11:19.389 --> 00:11:19.399 align:start position:0%
lot of other states that are out there
 
00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
um so I just wanted
 
00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:27.240 align:start position:0%
to address that thank you yeah I think
 
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:29.680 align:start position:0%
it's important to note that this has not
 
00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
really been updated since 1980 since
 
00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:34.760 align:start position:0%
then we have had a plethora of um
 
00:11:37.389 --> 00:11:37.399 align:start position:0%
knowledge and finding as to what abuse
 
00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839 align:start position:0%
looks like as to what toxic uh
 
00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
situations look like within families and
 
00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:44.240 align:start position:0%
we also understand and we have said
 
00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
multiple times in this legislature that
 
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
we do think that family is the best
 
00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
place that's the best place for kids so
 
00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
we want to be able to identify when
 
00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:56.680 align:start position:0%
there's an issue within a family so that
 
00:11:58.710 --> 00:11:58.720 align:start position:0%
we can have support for them so that
 
00:12:01.829 --> 00:12:01.839 align:start position:0%
they can you know work on those things
 
00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
and have ways to come together as a
 
00:12:08.389 --> 00:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
healthy family so certainly right now
 
00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:10.240 align:start position:0%
the way that the definitions are there's
 
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of
 
00:12:15.509 --> 00:12:15.519 align:start position:0%
um vagueness as far as when DCF can step
 
00:12:17.629 --> 00:12:17.639 align:start position:0%
in with
 
00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
um uh interventions not to take the kids
 
00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:25.160 align:start position:0%
away but just to um Provide support yeah
 
00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
services and support and so we're really
 
00:12:29.949 --> 00:12:29.959 align:start position:0%
at a situation where we have seen some
 
00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:32.440 align:start position:0%
extreme cases where when we're hearing
 
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
about it um it's too late for the child
 
00:12:37.389 --> 00:12:37.399 align:start position:0%
we certainly have had testimony of
 
00:12:40.509 --> 00:12:40.519 align:start position:0%
doctors um from Dartmouth come in and
 
00:12:43.629 --> 00:12:43.639 align:start position:0%
talk about babies who um have broken
 
00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:46.040 align:start position:0%
bones that are not able to move or
 
00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
anything and then they go back to the
 
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
parents because there's no there's
 
00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:51.880 align:start position:0%
nothing in our Provisions right now that
 
00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:53.560 align:start position:0%
would prevent that as a matter of fact
 
00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
the way that we have it now is stated
 
00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
that they do go back to their parents
 
00:12:59.430 --> 00:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
nobody can say anything if there's no
 
00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:02.920 align:start position:0%
finding which nobody's talking um then
 
00:13:04.829 --> 00:13:04.839 align:start position:0%
that that's part of the problem we also
 
00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:08.600 align:start position:0%
have a state where parents can decline
 
00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
to have dcyf come in um this does not
 
00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:15.160 align:start position:0%
change that either so this um simply
 
00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
says that we understand that uh the
 
00:13:19.949 --> 00:13:19.959 align:start position:0%
safety of children is important and this
 
00:13:22.829 --> 00:13:22.839 align:start position:0%
is what we're outlining is uh we find
 
00:13:25.389 --> 00:13:25.399 align:start position:0%
abuse or neglect um we do have
 
00:13:27.949 --> 00:13:27.959 align:start position:0%
rebuttable presumptions of harm to make
 
00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:30.440 align:start position:0%
sure that we're mitigating and not um
 
00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:32.600 align:start position:0%
over penalizing parents but also I think
 
00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
it's important to have updated
 
00:13:37.189 --> 00:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
definitions because because not only do
 
00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
we protect kids in this we actually
 
00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
protect parents too if we have a deeper
 
00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
understanding of what abuse is in a
 
00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:46.360 align:start position:0%
modern way we're not penalizing parents
 
00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:49.839 align:start position:0%
that maybe that's not abuse so um do you
 
00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:51.880 align:start position:0%
have a question yeah um I just I just
 
00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:54.440 align:start position:0%
want to point out um I'm just why I'm
 
00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:57.160 align:start position:0%
here and and uh I'm on house criminal
 
00:13:59.389 --> 00:13:59.399 align:start position:0%
justice and Public Safety and we're
 
00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:01.720 align:start position:0%
considering a bill HB
 
00:14:06.269 --> 00:14:06.279 align:start position:0%
257 which expand greatly expands the
 
00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:11.160 align:start position:0%
criminalization of uh uh let's call it
 
00:14:13.389 --> 00:14:13.399 align:start position:0%
inadequate parenting it it's entitled
 
00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
it's a child neglect Bill and uh
 
00:14:19.269 --> 00:14:19.279 align:start position:0%
criminalizes neglectful parenting with
 
00:14:19.279 --> 00:14:20.310 align:start position:0%
criminalizes neglectful parenting with
some

00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
specifics uh there is it's we're really
 
00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
struggling with the bill because um I
 
00:14:29.189 --> 00:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
think many on the committee believe
 
00:14:34.509 --> 00:14:34.519 align:start position:0%
believe the DCF system the Civil system
 
00:14:38.189 --> 00:14:38.199 align:start position:0%
is better able to manage families that
 
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
are having problems going forward than
 
00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
is the criminal system uh there's a lot
 
00:14:46.389 --> 00:14:46.399 align:start position:0%
more limits you know in the criminal
 
00:14:49.509 --> 00:14:49.519 align:start position:0%
system and um
 
00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:52.680 align:start position:0%
it's it may be that
 
00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:55.720 align:start position:0%
257 doesn't need to go forward or needs
 
00:15:00.069 --> 00:15:00.079 align:start position:0%
to be significantly scaled back
 
00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
as the committee understands what's
 
00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:04.120 align:start position:0%
going on with 553 so that's that's why
 
00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:07.320 align:start position:0%
I'm here thank you I appreciate that
 
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:33.189 --> 00:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
session and I think that um you know
 
00:15:37.509 --> 00:15:37.519 align:start position:0%
you'll see within our committee our
 
00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:38.920 align:start position:0%
regular committee and stuff we have a
 
00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:40.720 align:start position:0%
lot of bills coming forth this year
 
00:15:43.309 --> 00:15:43.319 align:start position:0%
trying to kind of attack this problem
 
00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:45.680 align:start position:0%
that we see certainly um with Harmony
 
00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
Montgomery and some of our other um uh
 
00:15:51.749 --> 00:15:51.759 align:start position:0%
notable cases that we've seen we have
 
00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:53.720 align:start position:0%
seen the breakdown of the system so we
 
00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:56.440 align:start position:0%
have a lot of different bills trying to
 
00:15:58.670 --> 00:15:58.680 align:start position:0%
really come at this issue of protecting
 
00:15:58.680 --> 00:15:59.509 align:start position:0%
really come at this issue of protecting
kids

00:15:59.509 --> 00:15:59.519 align:start position:0%
kids
 
00:16:01.749 --> 00:16:01.759 align:start position:0%
I think this is the F A foundational
 
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
bill because this is what these other
 
00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:06.040 align:start position:0%
bills then um get built off of this is
 
00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
simply definitions um so that way then
 
00:16:13.509 --> 00:16:13.519 align:start position:0%
we can um basically not have a crumbling
 
00:16:15.389 --> 00:16:15.399 align:start position:0%
Foundation as to how we're protecting
 
00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:17.240 align:start position:0%
kids right now we have a very outdated
 
00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
and crumbling Foundation which is
 
00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:22.240 align:start position:0%
leading to um a lot of bills that either
 
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
can't be followed or that are just
 
00:16:27.389 --> 00:16:27.399 align:start position:0%
ineffective or um maybe too punitive as
 
00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:29.160 align:start position:0%
well so we need to make sure that we
 
00:16:32.309 --> 00:16:32.319 align:start position:0%
have this um foundation in there have
 
00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:33.839 align:start position:0%
you guys gotten a chance to kind of look
 
00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
at that and see that there are a lot of
 
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
other states that have
 
00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.110 align:start position:0%
other states that have
that

00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:16:42.629 --> 00:16:42.639 align:start position:0%
okay um just to paraphrase so last time
 
00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
we did talk about uh constitutionality
 
00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
of this bill um representative deimon it
 
00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:50.920 align:start position:0%
is one of her jobs to make sure that it
 
00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
is you know constitutional as far as
 
00:16:55.389 --> 00:16:55.399 align:start position:0%
what we're doing and so um you did find
 
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
it is absolutely
 
00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:05.470 align:start position:0%
it is absolutely
constitutional

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:05.480 align:start position:0%
constitutional
 
00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:10.280 align:start position:0%
uh I found I think four three court
 
00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
cases that the uh Supreme Court found it
 
00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:17.829 align:start position:0%
cases that the uh Supreme Court found it
constitutional

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:17.839 align:start position:0%
constitutional
 
00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
um people need to remember when they
 
00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:22.429 align:start position:0%
um people need to remember when they
talk

00:17:22.429 --> 00:17:22.439 align:start position:0%
talk
 
00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
about the constitutionality of bills is
 
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.190 align:start position:0%
about the constitutionality of bills is
that

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
unless it is specifically stated
 
00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:33.320 align:start position:0%
otherwise bills are
 
00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
constitutional this bill happens to be
 
00:17:38.669 --> 00:17:38.679 align:start position:0%
be a bill
 
00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:42.760 align:start position:0%
where for many many years due to the
 
00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:52.640 align:start position:0%
to actuality and perception
 
00:17:58.190 --> 00:17:58.200 align:start position:0%
are the biggest hurdles that we face so
 
00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.470 align:start position:0%
are the biggest hurdles that we face so
the

00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:04.760 align:start position:0%
perception of what is and is not child
 
00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect is not always actual
 
00:18:13.549 --> 00:18:13.559 align:start position:0%
it is not always specific enough so one
 
00:18:17.669 --> 00:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
of the uh issues that we face right now
 
00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
or questions
 
00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
is so if I say to my
 
00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
child that's it go to your room and
 
00:18:30.029 --> 00:18:30.039 align:start position:0%
don't come out until so your room is
 
00:18:33.789 --> 00:18:33.799 align:start position:0%
clean that that could be
 
00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
neglect I've checked with attorneys with
 
00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
judges with psychologist with
 
00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
psychiatrists now that
 
00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
that's a situation where on the face
 
00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:55.830 align:start position:0%
that's a situation where on the face
absolutely

00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
00:18:59.430 --> 00:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
not if you say
 
00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:01.880 align:start position:0%
to your child if I have to leave you in
 
00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:04.840 align:start position:0%
that room for a month and you
 
00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:08.440 align:start position:0%
do and you refuse to give the child food
 
00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
or access to bathroom facilities or
 
00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:16.280 align:start position:0%
water now we're talking a different
 
00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
story but actually saying that's it go
 
00:19:20.669 --> 00:19:20.679 align:start position:0%
to your room and don't come out until
 
00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
it's clean or that's it go to your room
 
00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:26.600 align:start position:0%
until you can change your attitude
 
00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:30.360 align:start position:0%
things of that sort there it's not
 
00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:34.480 align:start position:0%
emotional abuse it absolutely is not so
 
00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
the Fear Factor that and I'm go I'll go
 
00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:41.000 align:start position:0%
back to the media situation The Fear
 
00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
Factor that the
 
00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:46.600 align:start position:0%
media ends up putting out there for
 
00:19:52.149 --> 00:19:52.159 align:start position:0%
people is the problem that we have
 
00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
with society's perception of what is and
 
00:19:59.230 --> 00:19:59.240 align:start position:0%
is not one the perception that it's
 
00:20:05.669 --> 00:20:05.679 align:start position:0%
constitutional is in my opinion not
 
00:20:09.669 --> 00:20:09.679 align:start position:0%
true two the perception of what is and
 
00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
is not emotional abuse has
 
00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
already been talked about in 13 other
 
00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
states and it has already been discussed
 
00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
in the courts in the past all this bill
 
00:20:25.909 --> 00:20:25.919 align:start position:0%
is doing is putting a
 
00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:29.240 align:start position:0%
finite list of
 
00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
definitions it is not saying that if you
 
00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:34.440 align:start position:0%
do this you're going to have your
 
00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:37.720 align:start position:0%
children removed first of all another
 
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
perception is that um dcyf or DHHS can
 
00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:45.480 align:start position:0%
walk in your house and take your
 
00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
kids that's illegal to be honest with
 
00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:51.950 align:start position:0%
kids that's illegal to be honest with
you

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:55.549 --> 00:20:55.559 align:start position:0%
um they still have to call the police
 
00:20:58.630 --> 00:20:58.640 align:start position:0%
department and the police are who
 
00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
removed the children from the home and
 
00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
put the children
 
00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
someplace deemed safe until the
 
00:21:11.149 --> 00:21:11.159 align:start position:0%
investigation can be done so that's
 
00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:14.720 align:start position:0%
another perception it is not in this
 
00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:18.640 align:start position:0%
bill it does not give any
 
00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:22.200 align:start position:0%
entity any more latitude than what the
 
00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
law already
 
00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:29.000 align:start position:0%
provides to keep children safe this is
 
00:21:32.029 --> 00:21:32.039 align:start position:0%
the definitions are
 
00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:34.720 align:start position:0%
merely helping those
 
00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
entities parents and the
 
00:21:42.549 --> 00:21:42.559 align:start position:0%
courts understand the definition of all
 
00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
of these abusive
 
00:21:48.269 --> 00:21:48.279 align:start position:0%
behaviors so that you can't be brought
 
00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:50.840 align:start position:0%
into court and your
 
00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
child my child did it so my child who is
 
00:21:59.950 --> 00:21:59.960 align:start position:0%
now almost 50 when she was 12 decided
 
00:22:02.269 --> 00:22:02.279 align:start position:0%
that I was an abusive parent because I
 
00:22:04.029 --> 00:22:04.039 align:start position:0%
told her that she had to switch the
 
00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:05.320 align:start position:0%
toilet every
 
00:22:08.549 --> 00:22:08.559 align:start position:0%
day and she called child abuse and I I
 
00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:11.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
number it it it is a perception that is
 
00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
that a gross disgusting job
 
00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely but is it child abuse
 
00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely not so the perceptions are
 
00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:29.480 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to clean up and make
 
00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
finite in this bill and that's what I
 
00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
hope people take away from this bill
 
00:22:37.669 --> 00:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
there if you look at the list of
 
00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
sponsors it is typical of Children and
 
00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:43.960 align:start position:0%
Family Law committee
 
00:22:48.789 --> 00:22:48.799 align:start position:0%
that it is not a Democrat bill it is not
 
00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:54.640 align:start position:0%
a Republican bill it is a good
 
00:22:58.510 --> 00:22:58.520 align:start position:0%
bipartisan effort to help the children
 
00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
children and the families of this state
 
00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:03.880 align:start position:0%
and that's why we're working together to
 
00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:06.360 align:start position:0%
get this done and get it done
 
00:23:09.549 --> 00:23:09.559 align:start position:0%
well and and and that's my
 
00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:11.480 align:start position:0%
perception thank
 
00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:14.120 align:start position:0%
you thank you I appreciate that you know
 
00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
I would like to um normally I'd say
 
00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:17.320 align:start position:0%
elephant but I'll say gorilla in the
 
00:23:18.909 --> 00:23:18.919 align:start position:0%
room I'd like to talk about the gorilla
 
00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
in the room there has been question what
 
00:23:23.789 --> 00:23:23.799 align:start position:0%
if I disagree with my child's religious
 
00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:27.080 align:start position:0%
choices what if I disagree with their um
 
00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:29.320 align:start position:0%
orientation um you know and that kind of
 
00:23:31.549 --> 00:23:31.559 align:start position:0%
stuff is that then if I disagree with
 
00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
them can they take my kids away what if
 
00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:36.760 align:start position:0%
my kid is is you know tells me that
 
00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
they're trans and I say no I disagree
 
00:23:43.029 --> 00:23:43.039 align:start position:0%
with that is that in itself reason for
 
00:23:44.909 --> 00:23:44.919 align:start position:0%
them to have an intervention take away
 
00:23:47.909 --> 00:23:47.919 align:start position:0%
no not at all I will be quite Frank my
 
00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
son when I was getting threats from a
 
00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:51.950 align:start position:0%
son when I was getting threats from a
particular

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
particular
 
00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
group that my son decided to say that
 
00:23:56.909 --> 00:23:56.919 align:start position:0%
that's the political leaning he was he
 
00:23:59.510 --> 00:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
was um it was a rough moment in time
 
00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
that was last year I was getting death
 
00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
threats I was getting threats of getting
 
00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:04.600 align:start position:0%
feathered and tarred because I said not
 
00:24:07.269 --> 00:24:07.279 align:start position:0%
all parents are good parents um not only
 
00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:08.600 align:start position:0%
am I going to stand by that but I'm
 
00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:10.480 align:start position:0%
going to stand by my son who said that's
 
00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
his political leaning and did we have a
 
00:24:17.149 --> 00:24:17.159 align:start position:0%
a disagreement absolutely I mean did I
 
00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
say how could you do this and did I get
 
00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
upset yes but the difference is I didn't
 
00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:25.360 align:start position:0%
take it to the point where now he
 
00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
trembles when he gets around me and he
 
00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:29.640 align:start position:0%
wants to talk about it or he curls into
 
00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:32.120 align:start position:0%
a fetal position if somebody brings up
 
00:24:34.909 --> 00:24:34.919 align:start position:0%
this particular topic there are levels
 
00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:37.320 align:start position:0%
you are allowed to disagree with your
 
00:24:40.549 --> 00:24:40.559 align:start position:0%
kids it's how you go about it that makes
 
00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
the difference whether or not it's abuse
 
00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:45.480 align:start position:0%
our children need to understand that not
 
00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:47.000 align:start position:0%
everybody's going to always agree with
 
00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:49.880 align:start position:0%
them that's okay but they also need to
 
00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:51.480 align:start position:0%
understand that they are an individual
 
00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
who has rights who has entitled to their
 
00:24:58.149 --> 00:24:58.159 align:start position:0%
own opinions and can make a disagreement
 
00:24:59.389 --> 00:24:59.399 align:start position:0%
with somebody else that's what we're
 
00:25:01.549 --> 00:25:01.559 align:start position:0%
raising them for we're raising them to
 
00:25:04.269 --> 00:25:04.279 align:start position:0%
go out and and think critically in the
 
00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
world so I think that's very important
 
00:25:07.789 --> 00:25:07.799 align:start position:0%
to acknowledge too because I do
 
00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:09.200 align:start position:0%
understand that people have that fear
 
00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:11.000 align:start position:0%
right now and I
 
00:25:13.149 --> 00:25:13.159 align:start position:0%
don't as my grandma used to say I want
 
00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
them to borrow trouble don't have a fear
 
00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
that you don't have to have um it's just
 
00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:19.960 align:start position:0%
not a reality that we're looking at with
 
00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:21.310 align:start position:0%
not a reality that we're looking at with
these

00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:21.320 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:22.830 align:start position:0%
these
definitions

00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:22.840 align:start position:0%
definitions
 
00:25:25.549 --> 00:25:25.559 align:start position:0%
so Jody do you have any representative
 
00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
Nelson do you have any input hi yeah
 
00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:31.240 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you thank you madam
 
00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:34.360 align:start position:0%
chairwoman um yeah you know just further
 
00:25:38.149 --> 00:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
um to that there you know there are
 
00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:40.720 align:start position:0%
clear definitions of what emotional
 
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
abuse is I think that representative D
 
00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:45.720 align:start position:0%
Simon had brought up the last time that
 
00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:49.360 align:start position:0%
there in in uh law already in New
 
00:25:51.909 --> 00:25:51.919 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there the other types of abuse
 
00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
are defined so I think be very helpful
 
00:25:57.630 --> 00:25:57.640 align:start position:0%
to have that definition as well with you
 
00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
know um what the definition of emotional
 
00:26:04.149 --> 00:26:04.159 align:start position:0%
abuse is um I have done a lot of
 
00:26:06.669 --> 00:26:06.679 align:start position:0%
research and
 
00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:10.240 align:start position:0%
um Most states now do include some
 
00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:13.880 align:start position:0%
definition of emotional mental
 
00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
psychological you know abuse in their
 
00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
child abuse laws um also too I'm going
 
00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
to be quite Frank with everybody I was
 
00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
in involved in a
 
00:26:29.549 --> 00:26:29.559 align:start position:0%
um emotionally uh and physic
 
00:26:31.389 --> 00:26:31.399 align:start position:0%
um abusive relationship when I was a
 
00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
young adult and I think a lot of us um
 
00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:37.000 align:start position:0%
who have can understand the
 
00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
statement that I'm going to say I did
 
00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:41.960 align:start position:0%
have in in the times of when I was
 
00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:46.120 align:start position:0%
berated for hours I had said hit me
 
00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
because it would hurt
 
00:26:50.909 --> 00:26:50.919 align:start position:0%
less as an adult I would say that a
 
00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
child can't say that and I know because
 
00:26:56.669 --> 00:26:56.679 align:start position:0%
I've spoken with people and particularly
 
00:26:59.149 --> 00:26:59.159 align:start position:0%
men who who speak speak about their
 
00:27:03.909 --> 00:27:03.919 align:start position:0%
severe emotional neglect and abuse
 
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
um they you can see that hurt child in
 
00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
their eyes no matter if they're 30 or 80
 
00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:13.480 align:start position:0%
so um I
 
00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:16.480 align:start position:0%
really um I I I hear some of the
 
00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:18.760 align:start position:0%
concerns I'm not just discounting
 
00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
that if we're not going to include
 
00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
emotional abuse in the definition of
 
00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:34.240 align:start position:0%
child abuse in New Hampshire we are
 
00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:37.880 align:start position:0%
worrying about what is conjecture to the
 
00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
result of children here in New Hampshire
 
00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
and families not getting the help that
 
00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:44.840 align:start position:0%
they need and Des
 
00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:47.720 align:start position:0%
deserve that's
 
00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:55.720 align:start position:0%
good I concur thank you it I couldn't
 
00:27:59.430 --> 00:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
have said it better thank you
 
00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
that's very good go ahead have do you
 
00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
have a proposed amendment or well one
 
00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:07.240 align:start position:0%
thing that we talked about so I I don't
 
00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
know if anybody else had a proposed
 
00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:11.080 align:start position:0%
amendment um but one thing that we did
 
00:28:13.029 --> 00:28:13.039 align:start position:0%
talk about and that has also come up is
 
00:28:16.909 --> 00:28:16.919 align:start position:0%
that trauma and form language around um
 
00:28:19.789 --> 00:28:19.799 align:start position:0%
uh substance abuse disorder we have that
 
00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
is another concern that we have heard
 
00:28:24.149 --> 00:28:24.159 align:start position:0%
about I've spent our week off doing a
 
00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
lot of research um looking at that
 
00:28:28.149 --> 00:28:28.159 align:start position:0%
substance abuse disorder because I also
 
00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
o heard that currently
 
00:28:35.269 --> 00:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
sorry we had People based on what we
 
00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:38.120 align:start position:0%
have right now we have people afraid to
 
00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:40.760 align:start position:0%
go seek medical care if they are have
 
00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
substance abuse disorder and are
 
00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:45.880 align:start position:0%
pregnant and so they're already afraid
 
00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
so then it's looking well how can we
 
00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
make this better so one thing that I do
 
00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
like about the language that Senator
 
00:28:53.789 --> 00:28:53.799 align:start position:0%
Carson worked on is that we do talk
 
00:28:57.149 --> 00:28:57.159 align:start position:0%
about um and first of all this is not in
 
00:28:58.830 --> 00:28:58.840 align:start position:0%
the the original bill this is the
 
00:29:00.509 --> 00:29:00.519 align:start position:0%
amendment because the original bill when
 
00:29:03.149 --> 00:29:03.159 align:start position:0%
it went to OS got
 
00:29:06.269 --> 00:29:06.279 align:start position:0%
um reevaluated I don't know how to say
 
00:29:09.549 --> 00:29:09.559 align:start position:0%
that but it was not what we wanted um so
 
00:29:11.669 --> 00:29:11.679 align:start position:0%
the what we actually wanted is the
 
00:29:13.549 --> 00:29:13.559 align:start position:0%
amendment that we have and that talks
 
00:29:15.269 --> 00:29:15.279 align:start position:0%
about the rebuttable presumption of harm
 
00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
it also talks not about when um the baby
 
00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:20.440 align:start position:0%
is in utero because that does not fall
 
00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:22.600 align:start position:0%
under the child protection statute until
 
00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
the baby is born um but we do want to
 
00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that harm can come if a
 
00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:31.640 align:start position:0%
child is substance uh has is substance
 
00:29:35.509 --> 00:29:35.519 align:start position:0%
exposed but that can't be the only thing
 
00:29:37.909 --> 00:29:37.919 align:start position:0%
that counts as neglect because we also
 
00:29:39.029 --> 00:29:39.039 align:start position:0%
understand that there are a lot of
 
00:29:41.669 --> 00:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
parents when they find out they're
 
00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:44.200 align:start position:0%
pregnant they decide you know that's it
 
00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:46.120 align:start position:0%
they want to they want to end that and
 
00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:47.960 align:start position:0%
stuff so they are struggling with trying
 
00:29:50.269 --> 00:29:50.279 align:start position:0%
to get to that next step I think it's
 
00:29:53.669 --> 00:29:53.679 align:start position:0%
important that we have in here that if
 
00:29:56.909 --> 00:29:56.919 align:start position:0%
um they are monitored by a licensed
 
00:29:58.430 --> 00:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
healthc care provider which by the way
 
00:29:59.870 --> 00:29:59.880 align:start position:0%
there is not a timeline on that it
 
00:30:01.789 --> 00:30:01.799 align:start position:0%
doesn't say the whole nine months it
 
00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:03.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't say it just says that and I
 
00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:06.360 align:start position:0%
think that's an important um when this
 
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
bill goes through I think that would be
 
00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:12.240 align:start position:0%
important um thing for people to note to
 
00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
hopefully help them to want to get
 
00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:17.440 align:start position:0%
medical care and get that provider
 
00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:22.360 align:start position:0%
involved because if a provider is um
 
00:30:25.230 --> 00:30:25.240 align:start position:0%
monitoring them then that falls under
 
00:30:28.149 --> 00:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
the exemption here that we understand
 
00:30:30.149 --> 00:30:30.159 align:start position:0%
that what that there are a lot of
 
00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
nuances to substance abuse disorder and
 
00:30:35.029 --> 00:30:35.039 align:start position:0%
that we understand that people are
 
00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
trying to get help and should not be
 
00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:38.360 align:start position:0%
penalized they should not be unfairly
 
00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:40.720 align:start position:0%
looked at right now it is my
 
00:30:42.549 --> 00:30:42.559 align:start position:0%
understanding that because we do not
 
00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
have anything in there and because we
 
00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:46.600 align:start position:0%
are all mandated reporters if someone
 
00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:49.360 align:start position:0%
would come and say have a baby that's
 
00:30:52.029 --> 00:30:52.039 align:start position:0%
been substance um exposed it is a an
 
00:30:55.789 --> 00:30:55.799 align:start position:0%
automatic screen in because there is not
 
00:30:58.149 --> 00:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
um any kind of exception right now so if
 
00:31:00.549 --> 00:31:00.559 align:start position:0%
that gets called in which there's
 
00:31:02.509 --> 00:31:02.519 align:start position:0%
nothing telling the doctors not to at
 
00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:05.039 align:start position:0%
this point because in law because we're
 
00:31:07.269 --> 00:31:07.279 align:start position:0%
all mandated reporters so I think that's
 
00:31:11.389 --> 00:31:11.399 align:start position:0%
important to note as well um and trying
 
00:31:13.149 --> 00:31:13.159 align:start position:0%
to do once again right by the children
 
00:31:15.029 --> 00:31:15.039 align:start position:0%
we do understand the complications that
 
00:31:19.789 --> 00:31:19.799 align:start position:0%
children have um so we do have more
 
00:31:21.629 --> 00:31:21.639 align:start position:0%
trauma inform form language for that
 
00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
particular section that we discussed did
 
00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
anybody else have anything for an
 
00:31:29.549 --> 00:31:29.559 align:start position:0%
amendment um on any of this
 
00:31:29.559 --> 00:31:32.710 align:start position:0%
amendment um on any of this
the

00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:36.509 --> 00:31:36.519 align:start position:0%
definition we need to add uh as
 
00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:39.320 align:start position:0%
representative um Nelson said I think we
 
00:31:43.029 --> 00:31:43.039 align:start position:0%
need to add uh the specific definition
 
00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
for emotional abuse um I I I don't think
 
00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
what we have is specific enough to
 
00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:53.960 align:start position:0%
properly cover it okay um I'd like to
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
call the I know office of child advocate
 
00:31:57.629 --> 00:31:57.639 align:start position:0%
is here and I'd like to call them up
 
00:31:59.830 --> 00:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
about that uh
 
00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:03.240 align:start position:0%
definition why it's not in there can we
 
00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:11.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
um and then DCF to I don't know we don't
 
00:32:17.149 --> 00:32:17.159 align:start position:0%
have four chairs but you guys would be
 
00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:37.909 --> 00:32:37.919 align:start position:0%
you're fine sorry to like call you up
 
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
it's like you don't want the teacher to
 
00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:41.200 align:start position:0%
call on you apologize so I know we
 
00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:44.600 align:start position:0%
talked about defining emotional abuse
 
00:32:48.629 --> 00:32:48.639 align:start position:0%
during um eight weeks of weekly two to
 
00:32:50.509 --> 00:32:50.519 align:start position:0%
threeh hour long sessions with Senator
 
00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
Carson um and you know
 
00:32:55.750 --> 00:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
Senator Ganon was also Senator
 
00:32:58.669 --> 00:32:58.679 align:start position:0%
representative McMahon was also there um
 
00:33:02.389 --> 00:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
we in looking at all the other
 
00:33:06.029 --> 00:33:06.039 align:start position:0%
states rather than defining emotional
 
00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
abuse or emotional neglect it was more
 
00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:11.480 align:start position:0%
the way it currently is
 
00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
that abuse or neglect was being defined
 
00:33:18.669 --> 00:33:18.679 align:start position:0%
as the mental emotional psychological so
 
00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
through all those conversations and and
 
00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:24.200 align:start position:0%
maybe uh Susan or Jen remember more
 
00:33:27.149 --> 00:33:27.159 align:start position:0%
distinctly we ended up going kind of
 
00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
back and forth but not putting in a
 
00:33:34.190 --> 00:33:34.200 align:start position:0%
specific definition of emotional abuse
 
00:33:36.509 --> 00:33:36.519 align:start position:0%
or neglect
 
00:33:38.789 --> 00:33:38.799 align:start position:0%
because you know we didn't Al we also
 
00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
didn't Define mental abuse or neglect or
 
00:33:43.549 --> 00:33:43.559 align:start position:0%
you know psychological abuse or neglect
 
00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:47.000 align:start position:0%
the that sort of list of words is what
 
00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:50.480 align:start position:0%
the abuse or neglect is so I think the
 
00:33:52.909 --> 00:33:52.919 align:start position:0%
decision had been made rather than get
 
00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
into the weeds and defining every single
 
00:33:57.990 --> 00:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
one of those um but we could certainly
 
00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
um talk about it where we did Focus was
 
00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:03.480 align:start position:0%
the definition of psychological
 
00:34:05.549 --> 00:34:05.559 align:start position:0%
maltreatment which again is actually
 
00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
coming back to more of the examples like
 
00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
representative D simonia just gave about
 
00:34:11.669 --> 00:34:11.679 align:start position:0%
the belittling so I think that's how we
 
00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
kind of ended up resolving that issue
 
00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
that most of the concerns and examples
 
00:34:19.470 --> 00:34:19.480 align:start position:0%
we were hearing actually were defined in
 
00:34:21.869 --> 00:34:21.879 align:start position:0%
that psychological maltreatment which
 
00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:23.919 align:start position:0%
was already a definition in there that's
 
00:34:26.669 --> 00:34:26.679 align:start position:0%
not new but the language became a lot
 
00:34:29.349 --> 00:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
clearer like what you're saying of sort
 
00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
of those specific examples and that was
 
00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
language we pulled from a couple of
 
00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
other states it had actually been a
 
00:34:38.069 --> 00:34:38.079 align:start position:0%
longer list during those many many hours
 
00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:40.200 align:start position:0%
of committee hearings in the fall we
 
00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
deleted one that we were afraid may go
 
00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
too far so it it was really an evolution
 
00:34:50.349 --> 00:34:50.359 align:start position:0%
of that language and rather than Define
 
00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:53.720 align:start position:0%
the sort of emotional piece um we
 
00:34:55.149 --> 00:34:55.159 align:start position:0%
focused on that psychological
 
00:34:59.230 --> 00:34:59.240 align:start position:0%
maltreatment which is um
 
00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:01.280 align:start position:0%
at the bottom of page six of the
 
00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
25A if I can read roman numerals which
 
00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:11.440 align:start position:0%
is possible not um so that was really
 
00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:13.720 align:start position:0%
where we'd Focus that piece because that
 
00:35:15.589 --> 00:35:15.599 align:start position:0%
is where sort of the demeaning
 
00:35:15.599 --> 00:35:17.230 align:start position:0%
is where sort of the demeaning
threatening

00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:17.240 align:start position:0%
threatening
 
00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:19.640 align:start position:0%
humiliating um which seems to be the
 
00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
examples everyone gives when they're
 
00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
thinking emotional it's really
 
00:35:25.870 --> 00:35:25.880 align:start position:0%
psychological so um that is sort of how
 
00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
we landed with that other committee
 
00:35:29.589 --> 00:35:29.599 align:start position:0%
after a lot of
 
00:35:32.829 --> 00:35:32.839 align:start position:0%
conversations um and then within serious
 
00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
impairment emotional was already in
 
00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
serious impairment so that's the middle
 
00:35:39.109 --> 00:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
of page seven serious impairment is
 
00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:41.640 align:start position:0%
another place where we really were
 
00:35:44.109 --> 00:35:44.119 align:start position:0%
striving to be a little bit more exact
 
00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
because if you look at the definition of
 
00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
neglect it's the enumerated plus serious
 
00:35:53.109 --> 00:35:53.119 align:start position:0%
impairment or likely to cause serious
 
00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
impairment so it's not just the
 
00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
definition of GCT that goes hand inand
 
00:35:58.710 --> 00:35:58.720 align:start position:0%
with serious impairment so serious
 
00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
impairment was another piece and that
 
00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
was where we'd seen a lot of gaps in
 
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
cases that had come to the oca's
 
00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:08.440 align:start position:0%
attention um either the division or the
 
00:36:11.069 --> 00:36:11.079 align:start position:0%
courts sort of trying to get into the
 
00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
nuance and nitty-gritty of what was
 
00:36:15.349 --> 00:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
serious impairment in some cases
 
00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:18.520 align:start position:0%
including those severely injured infants
 
00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:21.200 align:start position:0%
that we were seeing gaps where um you
 
00:36:22.750 --> 00:36:22.760 align:start position:0%
know the division might think we have a
 
00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:25.240 align:start position:0%
solid case and a court or or somewhere
 
00:36:26.829 --> 00:36:26.839 align:start position:0%
else saying me you don't quite meet
 
00:36:29.109 --> 00:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
serious impairment so those were the two
 
00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
places we tried to focus on to build out
 
00:36:34.990 --> 00:36:35.000 align:start position:0%
the nuance and Clarity um rather than
 
00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
try and defined emotional abuse or
 
00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:40.200 align:start position:0%
neglect because then you're starting to
 
00:36:42.109 --> 00:36:42.119 align:start position:0%
like do you define mental abuse do you
 
00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
def you know it got a little bit too um
 
00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:46.760 align:start position:0%
detailed but we did definitely talk
 
00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
about that a lot and go back and forth
 
00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
on it a lot so hopefully looking at
 
00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:54.720 align:start position:0%
serious impairment together with neglect
 
00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:56.640 align:start position:0%
and then that psychological maltreatment
 
00:36:58.870 --> 00:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
which is really underutilized currently
 
00:37:00.589 --> 00:37:00.599 align:start position:0%
I was a former dcyf attorney and there
 
00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:03.480 align:start position:0%
were lots of cases that we felt did rise
 
00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
to the level of psychological Mal
 
00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:06.200 align:start position:0%
treatment sort of what you're talking
 
00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:08.440 align:start position:0%
about representative Nelson of just the
 
00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
berating that's almost worse than the
 
00:37:13.109 --> 00:37:13.119 align:start position:0%
physical we would see in cases and in
 
00:37:14.589 --> 00:37:14.599 align:start position:0%
psychological Mal treatment was very
 
00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:16.079 align:start position:0%
rarely used because it was just really
 
00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
hard to prove um so that was a gap we
 
00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
had seen and in cases um but certainly
 
00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
if on the emotional AB if I can add in
 
00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
in looking at different emotional abuse
 
00:37:29.829 --> 00:37:29.839 align:start position:0%
um definitions across the country in
 
00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:31.720 align:start position:0%
different states there was a lot of
 
00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:34.760 align:start position:0%
bringing it back to um emotional injury
 
00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:36.440 align:start position:0%
and it was talking about an injury as
 
00:37:39.109 --> 00:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
you know an incident and defined event
 
00:37:41.109 --> 00:37:41.119 align:start position:0%
um and in really digging deeper into
 
00:37:43.829 --> 00:37:43.839 align:start position:0%
that it we found that that could
 
00:37:46.990 --> 00:37:47.000 align:start position:0%
actually um reduce the amount of of
 
00:37:48.910 --> 00:37:48.920 align:start position:0%
supported allegations or or calls to the
 
00:37:51.589 --> 00:37:51.599 align:start position:0%
agency if you have it so strictly
 
00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:54.280 align:start position:0%
defined because it's hard to then Define
 
00:37:55.589 --> 00:37:55.599 align:start position:0%
that injury and there was a lot of
 
00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
conversation in the committee as well
 
00:37:58.069 --> 00:37:58.079 align:start position:0%
about well would that have to be
 
00:37:59.710 --> 00:37:59.720 align:start position:0%
something that a doctor then diagnoses
 
00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
that an injury actually occurred um you
 
00:38:04.030 --> 00:38:04.040 align:start position:0%
know a therapist or a counselor as
 
00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:07.000 align:start position:0%
opposed to a medical doctor and a lot of
 
00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:08.920 align:start position:0%
questions around is that going to hold
 
00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
up if we're looking for a specific
 
00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
injury versus spreading it in these
 
00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
other areas to catch more of it because
 
00:38:19.470 --> 00:38:19.480 align:start position:0%
that would be a high cost to the state
 
00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
if you're having to hire experts for
 
00:38:24.829 --> 00:38:24.839 align:start position:0%
every single case um so you know there's
 
00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:27.240 align:start position:0%
a Supreme Court case of it's around
 
00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
point ography but you know you know it
 
00:38:31.150 --> 00:38:31.160 align:start position:0%
when you see it it's real hard to Define
 
00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:33.440 align:start position:0%
but in sort of the totality of the
 
00:38:35.870 --> 00:38:35.880 align:start position:0%
circumstances um so that's why we we try
 
00:38:38.309 --> 00:38:38.319 align:start position:0%
to put that clarifying language in
 
00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:41.800 align:start position:0%
places um without raising the bar so
 
00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:45.160 align:start position:0%
high that now and we' had a case where a
 
00:38:47.589 --> 00:38:47.599 align:start position:0%
child had been um physically assaulted
 
00:38:50.670 --> 00:38:50.680 align:start position:0%
by a caregiver received a black eye and
 
00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
a court had said oh that's not serious
 
00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
impairment because the black eye heals
 
00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:57.200 align:start position:0%
but being physically assaulted to that
 
00:39:00.309 --> 00:39:00.319 align:start position:0%
extent by your primary caregiver is a
 
00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
different type of injury that is
 
00:39:05.069 --> 00:39:05.079 align:start position:0%
difficult to Define because the the fear
 
00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
um like you were talking about
 
00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
representative Greg of you can have a
 
00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:10.240 align:start position:0%
disagreement it's when your kid flinches
 
00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:11.560 align:start position:0%
every time you walk into the room but
 
00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
that's very hard to Define um so that
 
00:39:19.349 --> 00:39:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:21.870 --> 00:39:21.880 align:start position:0%
super hello thank you for your thank you
 
00:39:27.630 --> 00:39:27.640 align:start position:0%
for your answer um I also um my I have a
 
00:39:29.390 --> 00:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
representative Rice gave me a nickname
 
00:39:31.829 --> 00:39:31.839 align:start position:0%
I'm the late night researcher because if
 
00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:35.560 align:start position:0%
I can't sleep on researching and sending
 
00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:36.550 align:start position:0%
I can't sleep on researching and sending
her

00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
her
 
00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
stuff um and I think that feedback that
 
00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
I've just gotten from other legislators
 
00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:44.720 align:start position:0%
and concerned um constituents is that in
 
00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
our law in our rsas now like literally
 
00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:50.240 align:start position:0%
it would say physical abuse is blah
 
00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:53.000 align:start position:0%
right so I I definitely see what you're
 
00:39:56.349 --> 00:39:56.359 align:start position:0%
saying but I think it's hard for people
 
00:39:57.950 --> 00:39:57.960 align:start position:0%
to kind of get
 
00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
around that it's not a
 
00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:03.240 align:start position:0%
specific you
 
00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:05.510 align:start position:0%
specific you
know

00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
um definition to refer to like some
 
00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
other types of abuse in RSA and
 
00:40:17.349 --> 00:40:17.359 align:start position:0%
um I know also in other states like for
 
00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
where did I say for example um well
 
00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:23.200 align:start position:0%
never mind because I just clicked out of
 
00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:25.160 align:start position:0%
it I don't want to waste our time but um
 
00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
there are other definitions that um
 
00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
are um I'm sorry uh if you could just
 
00:40:34.109 --> 00:40:34.119 align:start position:0%
please hold on one second I think it is
 
00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:36.680 align:start position:0%
here otherwise um I can return to it
 
00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:38.349 align:start position:0%
here otherwise um I can return to it
later

00:40:38.349 --> 00:40:38.359 align:start position:0%
later
 
00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:43.480 align:start position:0%
um it was more um less um what you were
 
00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
talking about and more of uh defining um
 
00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
it as something that is Habitual you
 
00:40:57.270 --> 00:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
know um and being vague like that um
 
00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:07.150 --> 00:41:07.160 align:start position:0%
um that's all and I think that's that is
 
00:41:08.589 --> 00:41:08.599 align:start position:0%
sort of the language that ended up in
 
00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
psychological maltreatment is that it
 
00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
did require a pattern of threatening de
 
00:41:15.870 --> 00:41:15.880 align:start position:0%
meaning humiliated which may include but
 
00:41:17.589 --> 00:41:17.599 align:start position:0%
not be limited too and then gave very
 
00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
specific examples and I think this
 
00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
language came directly from Colorado
 
00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
maybe or maybe been Connecticut some
 
00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
examples yeah so and that was and again
 
00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
so that's in psychological
 
00:41:33.829 --> 00:41:33.839 align:start position:0%
maltreatment but maybe that's a
 
00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
definition of
 
00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:38.680 align:start position:0%
emotional abuse I mean I I guess you
 
00:41:39.990 --> 00:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
know the words but it's talking about
 
00:41:42.109 --> 00:41:42.119 align:start position:0%
belittling Terror terrorizing
 
00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
threatening abandonment or harm um
 
00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
exposure to criminal activities it is
 
00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
sort of a a laundry list can I just do a
 
00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:51.720 align:start position:0%
followup I'm just trying to get this
 
00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
bill passed you know and there are a lot
 
00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
of legislators that have a problem that
 
00:41:57.309 --> 00:41:57.319 align:start position:0%
we don't have some sort of definition so
 
00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:01.240 align:start position:0%
do we combine those two together and you
 
00:42:03.309 --> 00:42:03.319 align:start position:0%
know um so I that maybe is something
 
00:42:06.750 --> 00:42:06.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
on okay so in
 
00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
research types of emotional child abuse
 
00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:15.880 align:start position:0%
rejection ignoring shaming or
 
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
humiliating terrorizing and
 
00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
isolating and
 
00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:22.910 align:start position:0%
isolating and
gaslighting

00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
gaslighting
 
00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:25.160 align:start position:0%
so why can't
 
00:42:28.750 --> 00:42:28.760 align:start position:0%
we I mean I just
 
00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
why can't we just put that in there
 
00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
rejection telling a child they are
 
00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
worthless unwanted or
 
00:42:37.309 --> 00:42:37.319 align:start position:0%
unloved ignoring failing to respond to a
 
00:42:39.549 --> 00:42:39.559 align:start position:0%
child's emotional needs or withholding
 
00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
affection shaming or humiliating
 
00:42:44.589 --> 00:42:44.599 align:start position:0%
constantly criticizing belittling or
 
00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
making a child feel ashamed terrorizing
 
00:42:50.430 --> 00:42:50.440 align:start position:0%
using threats yelling or intimidating
 
00:42:53.309 --> 00:42:53.319 align:start position:0%
Behavior to control a child isolating
 
00:42:55.309 --> 00:42:55.319 align:start position:0%
keeping a child away from friends family
 
00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:05.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:09.990 --> 00:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
we did incate l oh I'm sorry I was not
 
00:43:12.030 --> 00:43:12.040 align:start position:0%
um the bottom of page two under the
 
00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
definition of abuse and it's hard to
 
00:43:16.829 --> 00:43:16.839 align:start position:0%
read Because all the cross outs but we
 
00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
did Define emotional harm under abuse
 
00:43:22.750 --> 00:43:22.760 align:start position:0%
and includes that psychological see I
 
00:43:24.829 --> 00:43:24.839 align:start position:0%
knew psychological Mal treatment was
 
00:43:27.790 --> 00:43:27.800 align:start position:0%
reference so that was how we built in so
 
00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:31.640 align:start position:0%
emotional harm is defined under abuse
 
00:43:35.790 --> 00:43:35.800 align:start position:0%
paragraph B and it incorporates um that
 
00:43:37.549 --> 00:43:37.559 align:start position:0%
psychological maltreatment that I was
 
00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
reading which is similar language but I
 
00:43:40.829 --> 00:43:40.839 align:start position:0%
like that language you were reading uh
 
00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
representative right too so certainly
 
00:43:46.549 --> 00:43:46.559 align:start position:0%
there could be um tweaks to it but we so
 
00:43:48.349 --> 00:43:48.359 align:start position:0%
we did try and Define emotional Herm
 
00:43:48.359 --> 00:43:50.829 align:start position:0%
we did try and Define emotional Herm
it's

00:43:50.829 --> 00:43:50.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
there yeah we have so I have something
 
00:43:57.710 --> 00:43:57.720 align:start position:0%
actually just forward to you um uh that
 
00:43:59.910 --> 00:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
has a it it defines each like ver what
 
00:44:02.109 --> 00:44:02.119 align:start position:0%
verbal abuse is constant criticism or
 
00:44:05.349 --> 00:44:05.359 align:start position:0%
each of the like seven parts that they
 
00:44:07.470 --> 00:44:07.480 align:start position:0%
have defined officially as emotional
 
00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
abuse um and I I'll forward that to all
 
00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:12.200 align:start position:0%
of you as well maybe that's something
 
00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
that we if you really feel strongly that
 
00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
we need to be more specific with this
 
00:44:18.309 --> 00:44:18.319 align:start position:0%
because certainly if this is going to
 
00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:20.720 align:start position:0%
upend a very important bill I can't
 
00:44:22.829 --> 00:44:22.839 align:start position:0%
stress enough how important this is
 
00:44:24.309 --> 00:44:24.319 align:start position:0%
we've been trying to get this updated
 
00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
for ages so if this is something yeah go
 
00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:27.589 align:start position:0%
for ages so if this is something yeah go
ahead

00:44:27.589 --> 00:44:27.599 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
00:44:29.829 --> 00:44:29.839 align:start position:0%
hi and I'm sorry I don't know why I said
 
00:44:33.069 --> 00:44:33.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:36.760 align:start position:0%
taking hi oh gosh
 
00:44:41.950 --> 00:44:41.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
it's um it I'm trying to um streamline
 
00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:55.230 --> 00:44:55.240 align:start position:0%
um issues with family
 
00:44:59.510 --> 00:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
court and parents not understanding
 
00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:03.400 align:start position:0%
certain parts of law regarding to family
 
00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:07.720 align:start position:0%
court and um I think that by being vague
 
00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:09.150 align:start position:0%
court and um I think that by being vague
in

00:45:09.150 --> 00:45:09.160 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
describing um this kind of thing
 
00:45:15.109 --> 00:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
honestly doesn't give a fair shake to
 
00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:17.240 align:start position:0%
the parents you know they might not
 
00:45:19.230 --> 00:45:19.240 align:start position:0%
might not understand specifically what
 
00:45:22.109 --> 00:45:22.119 align:start position:0%
they've done wrong by law and to have it
 
00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
be deter determined by somebody they
 
00:45:27.470 --> 00:45:27.480 align:start position:0%
might feel is being
 
00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:29.230 align:start position:0%
might feel is being
subjected

00:45:29.230 --> 00:45:29.240 align:start position:0%
subjected
 
00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:30.829 align:start position:0%
subjected
subjective

00:45:30.829 --> 00:45:30.839 align:start position:0%
subjective
 
00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:36.400 align:start position:0%
um you know I don't I don't know if
 
00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:38.910 align:start position:0%
um you know I don't I don't know if
that's

00:45:38.910 --> 00:45:38.920 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:46.109 --> 00:45:46.119 align:start position:0%
ahead I'm agreeing with that 100% saving
 
00:45:46.119 --> 00:45:46.870 align:start position:0%
ahead I'm agreeing with that 100% saving
a

00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
few key strokes is not going to save a
 
00:45:53.349 --> 00:45:53.359 align:start position:0%
child I remember a person that used to
 
00:45:55.470 --> 00:45:55.480 align:start position:0%
come to our committee representative
 
00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:00.040 align:start position:0%
rice will remember him the poor man had
 
00:46:03.230 --> 00:46:03.240 align:start position:0%
just absolutely no idea that what he had
 
00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:04.640 align:start position:0%
done was
 
00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:06.750 align:start position:0%
done was
wrong

00:46:06.750 --> 00:46:06.760 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
he it w it was a horrible thing to his
 
00:46:14.430 --> 00:46:14.440 align:start position:0%
child when he thought nothing about
 
00:46:17.069 --> 00:46:17.079 align:start position:0%
going up to her with his hands touching
 
00:46:20.549 --> 00:46:20.559 align:start position:0%
her and saying oh you're almost as big
 
00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
as your
 
00:46:27.290 --> 00:46:27.300 align:start position:0%
mother he meant in his mind
 
00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:28.790 align:start position:0%
mother he meant in his mind
[Music]

00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:33.400 align:start position:0%
nothing bad about that he had no idea
 
00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:34.530 align:start position:0%
nothing bad about that he had no idea
how

00:46:34.530 --> 00:46:34.540 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:36.190 align:start position:0%
how
[Music]

00:46:36.190 --> 00:46:36.200 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:46:39.910 --> 00:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
inappropriate that was he had absolutely
 
00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:44.800 align:start position:0%
no idea and that in many other reasons
 
00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:48.160 align:start position:0%
his children were removed from his
 
00:46:50.270 --> 00:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
home and he used to come to our
 
00:46:52.630 --> 00:46:52.640 align:start position:0%
committee and say they took my kids for
 
00:46:55.349 --> 00:46:55.359 align:start position:0%
no reason I asked him to bring his
 
00:46:57.910 --> 00:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
transcripts of the tri
 
00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:00.640 align:start position:0%
he and I sat for an hour and a half
 
00:47:03.309 --> 00:47:03.319 align:start position:0%
going over them and I pointed out to him
 
00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:05.880 align:start position:0%
at that point how inappropriate the
 
00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:08.030 align:start position:0%
at that point how inappropriate the
behavior

00:47:08.030 --> 00:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
behavior
 
00:47:10.390 --> 00:47:10.400 align:start position:0%
was and he
 
00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:12.309 align:start position:0%
was and he
said

00:47:12.309 --> 00:47:12.319 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
oh now how come it doesn't say that in
 
00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.069 align:start position:0%
oh now how come it doesn't say that in
the

00:47:18.069 --> 00:47:18.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:47:22.030 --> 00:47:22.040 align:start position:0%
law that's the point of these
 
00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:24.640 align:start position:0%
definitions this particular person may
 
00:47:27.589 --> 00:47:27.599 align:start position:0%
God Rest his soul
 
00:47:30.030 --> 00:47:30.040 align:start position:0%
had no
 
00:47:33.950 --> 00:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
idea that what he was doing was wrong he
 
00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
had no idea the effect that it had on
 
00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
his children none and that's what we're
 
00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
hearing a lot of is that they just don't
 
00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
get it in this bill if this does not
 
00:47:51.790 --> 00:47:51.800 align:start position:0%
pass and it is not
 
00:47:55.230 --> 00:47:55.240 align:start position:0%
specific like representative Nelson said
 
00:47:59.069 --> 00:47:59.079 align:start position:0%
then we have not done on our job MH I
 
00:48:00.630 --> 00:48:00.640 align:start position:0%
agree and I think that's really common
 
00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:02.720 align:start position:0%
for um people who are probably caught up
 
00:48:04.750 --> 00:48:04.760 align:start position:0%
in Cycles you know passed down from
 
00:48:07.109 --> 00:48:07.119 align:start position:0%
generations of what they think is
 
00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate um you know they don't have
 
00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:11.400 align:start position:0%
that insight into their own behavior and
 
00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
of course we have mental health issues
 
00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
and other things so there are some some
 
00:48:18.069 --> 00:48:18.079 align:start position:0%
hiccups in our system for sure yes um
 
00:48:21.430 --> 00:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
just speaking as a lawyer who you know
 
00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
for my whole career works with language
 
00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:26.960 align:start position:0%
and and and what
 
00:48:29.069 --> 00:48:29.079 align:start position:0%
what covers things from the point of
 
00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:32.240 align:start position:0%
view of Prosecuting cases and or or
 
00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:35.960 align:start position:0%
getting DC involved and uh the way the
 
00:48:39.230 --> 00:48:39.240 align:start position:0%
better and giving also giving notice I
 
00:48:43.270 --> 00:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
I'm supportive of the idea of having a
 
00:48:47.589 --> 00:48:47.599 align:start position:0%
list but I'm also supportive of changing
 
00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
the language that you see all the time
 
00:48:52.470 --> 00:48:52.480 align:start position:0%
in the law which may include but is not
 
00:48:55.230 --> 00:48:55.240 align:start position:0%
limited to you know that kind of we
 
00:48:57.309 --> 00:48:57.319 align:start position:0%
don't want the list to be
 
00:49:00.589 --> 00:49:00.599 align:start position:0%
uh exclusive I think instead of having
 
00:49:02.430 --> 00:49:02.440 align:start position:0%
which may include but it's not limited
 
00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
to language you need a a a subparagraph
 
00:49:10.589 --> 00:49:10.599 align:start position:0%
that says some version of and and I can
 
00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
you know later today I can write it up
 
00:49:16.349 --> 00:49:16.359 align:start position:0%
if it's valuable to anyone some version
 
00:49:16.359 --> 00:49:17.870 align:start position:0%
if it's valuable to anyone some version
of

00:49:17.870 --> 00:49:17.880 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:49:21.990 --> 00:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh the exam the examples given in this
 
00:49:25.829 --> 00:49:25.839 align:start position:0%
statute are just examples it's not an
 
00:49:27.309 --> 00:49:27.319 align:start position:0%
exclusive list
 
00:49:30.069 --> 00:49:30.079 align:start position:0%
and there there may well be other
 
00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
behavior that uh it falls within this I
 
00:49:35.349 --> 00:49:35.359 align:start position:0%
think that kind of notice to parents
 
00:49:39.270 --> 00:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
would be more explicit than the language
 
00:49:41.349 --> 00:49:41.359 align:start position:0%
everybody ignores including but not
 
00:49:44.190 --> 00:49:44.200 align:start position:0%
limited to it would be I think that we
 
00:49:45.990 --> 00:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
run the risk when we start giving
 
00:49:48.109 --> 00:49:48.119 align:start position:0%
examples is that there's no way we can
 
00:49:50.670 --> 00:49:50.680 align:start position:0%
list the millions of examples that we
 
00:49:53.589 --> 00:49:53.599 align:start position:0%
have so I think I understand and I hear
 
00:49:56.390 --> 00:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
the need for a specific definition um
 
00:49:59.870 --> 00:49:59.880 align:start position:0%
for those of you that um at DCF and
 
00:50:02.990 --> 00:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
office of child I've sent you um maybe
 
00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
something in all of you something that
 
00:50:07.309 --> 00:50:07.319 align:start position:0%
we can kind of start from and say could
 
00:50:09.789 --> 00:50:09.799 align:start position:0%
this work um this is a standard
 
00:50:11.549 --> 00:50:11.559 align:start position:0%
definitions of what emotional abuse
 
00:50:14.150 --> 00:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
looks like I certainly don't want to
 
00:50:16.630 --> 00:50:16.640 align:start position:0%
upend anything in here but I do see the
 
00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
need that I think we're going to have to
 
00:50:20.670 --> 00:50:20.680 align:start position:0%
have another subcommittee meeting to be
 
00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:22.109 align:start position:0%
have another subcommittee meeting to be
honest

00:50:22.109 --> 00:50:22.119 align:start position:0%
honest
 
00:50:22.119 --> 00:50:25.349 align:start position:0%
honest
unless

00:50:25.349 --> 00:50:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:29.910 --> 00:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
are yeah are we yeah so so we'll need an
 
00:50:32.670 --> 00:50:32.680 align:start position:0%
amendment did you just send it I sent
 
00:50:35.589 --> 00:50:35.599 align:start position:0%
yeah and that's what um representative
 
00:50:39.069 --> 00:50:39.079 align:start position:0%
pone think should go in um and then we
 
00:50:42.390 --> 00:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
could include the language of may
 
00:50:45.270 --> 00:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
include but not limited
 
00:50:48.190 --> 00:50:48.200 align:start position:0%
to again I would I would recommend a
 
00:50:50.109 --> 00:50:50.119 align:start position:0%
better language than that instead of
 
00:50:52.870 --> 00:50:52.880 align:start position:0%
having the language uh may include but
 
00:50:55.510 --> 00:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
it's not limited to I would I would say
 
00:50:58.750 --> 00:50:58.760 align:start position:0%
for example and then have the list and
 
00:51:01.150 --> 00:51:01.160 align:start position:0%
then at the end of the list say these
 
00:51:03.870 --> 00:51:03.880 align:start position:0%
are only examples
 
00:51:07.630 --> 00:51:07.640 align:start position:0%
um well we can have we can we can have a
 
00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
motion to have an amendment but not have
 
00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:12.640 align:start position:0%
the full Amendment language right now so
 
00:51:15.870 --> 00:51:15.880 align:start position:0%
I move that we have an amendment okay if
 
00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
I may add second okay A bit of context
 
00:51:20.750 --> 00:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
as well um we did I just want to share
 
00:51:23.349 --> 00:51:23.359 align:start position:0%
from the prior committee work um we did
 
00:51:25.309 --> 00:51:25.319 align:start position:0%
have a longer list that one under here I
 
00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
believe it may have been the seven that
 
00:51:28.510 --> 00:51:28.520 align:start position:0%
that you had that you have shared with
 
00:51:31.309 --> 00:51:31.319 align:start position:0%
us um and it was parsed down a bit
 
00:51:32.950 --> 00:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
because there were a lot of questions
 
00:51:36.190 --> 00:51:36.200 align:start position:0%
about um some of the the belittling
 
00:51:38.510 --> 00:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
aspects and really wanting to ensure
 
00:51:41.309 --> 00:51:41.319 align:start position:0%
that it stays at that um real high level
 
00:51:43.069 --> 00:51:43.079 align:start position:0%
that's fitting abuse and not those
 
00:51:44.589 --> 00:51:44.599 align:start position:0%
parents that are you know just
 
00:51:45.870 --> 00:51:45.880 align:start position:0%
threatening their their child that
 
00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
you're going to be in trouble if type of
 
00:51:51.349 --> 00:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
situation so um this list under
 
00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
psychological maltreatment is parsed
 
00:51:57.630 --> 00:51:57.640 align:start position:0%
down after those many commit meetings in
 
00:52:00.109 --> 00:52:00.119 align:start position:0%
the fall um so I just wanted to make
 
00:52:02.230 --> 00:52:02.240 align:start position:0%
sure that as we look at it again we may
 
00:52:03.630 --> 00:52:03.640 align:start position:0%
have to have some further conversations
 
00:52:05.069 --> 00:52:05.079 align:start position:0%
or we may be able to share some context
 
00:52:07.710 --> 00:52:07.720 align:start position:0%
with you all about which ones we were
 
00:52:10.190 --> 00:52:10.200 align:start position:0%
asked to parse down by that committee
 
00:52:13.710 --> 00:52:13.720 align:start position:0%
already and and I can also the including
 
00:52:15.510 --> 00:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
but not limited to language and and
 
00:52:18.829 --> 00:52:18.839 align:start position:0%
again U we we had all talked about that
 
00:52:21.510 --> 00:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
I in criminal law I know it's it's much
 
00:52:23.510 --> 00:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
less common it's got to be very exact
 
00:52:26.750 --> 00:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
and clear for criminal uh penalties but
 
00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
you know with child welfare and social
 
00:52:33.309 --> 00:52:33.319 align:start position:0%
work while we want it to be clear and
 
00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
transparent for parents to know I think
 
00:52:39.670 --> 00:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
there is a certain amount of once you
 
00:52:41.870 --> 00:52:41.880 align:start position:0%
start listing things anything not on
 
00:52:45.190 --> 00:52:45.200 align:start position:0%
that list is fine and if you start
 
00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
listing every single thing it it it does
 
00:52:50.549 --> 00:52:50.559 align:start position:0%
become it's going to be a 300 page long
 
00:52:50.559 --> 00:52:52.069 align:start position:0%
become it's going to be a 300 page long
statute

00:52:52.069 --> 00:52:52.079 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:52:54.549 --> 00:52:54.559 align:start position:0%
so a lot of the conversations we had in
 
00:52:56.670 --> 00:52:56.680 align:start position:0%
the fall also with Senator Carson and
 
00:52:56.680 --> 00:52:58.630 align:start position:0%
the fall also with Senator Carson and
subcommittee

00:52:58.630 --> 00:52:58.640 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
00:53:01.390 --> 00:53:01.400 align:start position:0%
was building that trust in the child
 
00:53:03.990 --> 00:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
welfare system that these are trained
 
00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
social workers going into a home and you
 
00:53:09.230 --> 00:53:09.240 align:start position:0%
never know what you're going to find and
 
00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
the thing that got called in might not
 
00:53:13.030 --> 00:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
be the worst thing you find when you set
 
00:53:16.510 --> 00:53:16.520 align:start position:0%
foot in that home and so there was
 
00:53:19.589 --> 00:53:19.599 align:start position:0%
conversations with various players of
 
00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
how because this whole statute is about
 
00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
protecting children and being able to
 
00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
have that little bit of leeway so it
 
00:53:28.109 --> 00:53:28.119 align:start position:0%
really was sort of trying to find
 
00:53:31.390 --> 00:53:31.400 align:start position:0%
that gray area of that the statute is
 
00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
clear to make sure you're not getting
 
00:53:35.069 --> 00:53:35.079 align:start position:0%
called in for sending your kid do their
 
00:53:38.549 --> 00:53:38.559 align:start position:0%
room or clean their room but also
 
00:53:40.430 --> 00:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
allowing the the child protection
 
00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
workers who are The Trusted
 
00:53:44.630 --> 00:53:44.640 align:start position:0%
Professionals in this field the the
 
00:53:48.309 --> 00:53:48.319 align:start position:0%
latitude to protect children um and some
 
00:53:50.990 --> 00:53:51.000 align:start position:0%
of those gaps we found were places where
 
00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
where you know the division already felt
 
00:53:55.750 --> 00:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
that they knew that this was abuse or
 
00:53:58.190 --> 00:53:58.200 align:start position:0%
neglect but that the law was not sort of
 
00:54:01.990 --> 00:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
allowing them to offer services um so
 
00:54:03.510 --> 00:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
Clarity is great especially as an
 
00:54:05.430 --> 00:54:05.440 align:start position:0%
attorney we like things to say exactly
 
00:54:07.670 --> 00:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
what we mean for them to say but we also
 
00:54:10.150 --> 00:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
do want to find that line to allow when
 
00:54:12.990 --> 00:54:13.000 align:start position:0%
you walk into a situation some latitude
 
00:54:14.430 --> 00:54:14.440 align:start position:0%
to be able to protect the children in
 
00:54:16.829 --> 00:54:16.839 align:start position:0%
that home um because it could be
 
00:54:20.190 --> 00:54:20.200 align:start position:0%
something completely unrelated going
 
00:54:23.470 --> 00:54:23.480 align:start position:0%
on so would
 
00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
you speak a little bit about if the
 
00:54:29.950 --> 00:54:29.960 align:start position:0%
verbage was in there that said shall be
 
00:54:33.950 --> 00:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
to and and that's the verbiage that is
 
00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
currently used in the current statute
 
00:54:40.549 --> 00:54:40.559 align:start position:0%
and in many other states and I I'd be
 
00:54:43.510 --> 00:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
interested of Representative U Nelson
 
00:54:45.390 --> 00:54:45.400 align:start position:0%
what what you found on your exhaustive
 
00:54:47.789 --> 00:54:47.799 align:start position:0%
review of States it's it's hard to make
 
00:54:50.510 --> 00:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
a law that you want to allow some wiggle
 
00:54:52.630 --> 00:54:52.640 align:start position:0%
room to protect children but you want to
 
00:54:55.030 --> 00:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
be clear without using that language and
 
00:54:57.470 --> 00:54:57.480 align:start position:0%
I think what um Cassandra was just
 
00:54:59.630 --> 00:54:59.640 align:start position:0%
saying is we really parsed out it's in
 
00:55:01.230 --> 00:55:01.240 align:start position:0%
the psychological maltreatment section
 
00:55:02.990 --> 00:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
but we could certainly move it to make
 
00:55:05.230 --> 00:55:05.240 align:start position:0%
it clearer
 
00:55:09.030 --> 00:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
um that that was sort of a laundry list
 
00:55:11.870 --> 00:55:11.880 align:start position:0%
with specific examples and you know it
 
00:55:14.510 --> 00:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
included trafficking and there was a lot
 
00:55:17.030 --> 00:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
of language in there um and Senator
 
00:55:19.309 --> 00:55:19.319 align:start position:0%
Carson and her committee did purse some
 
00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
of it out as kind of addressing some of
 
00:55:25.750 --> 00:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
the fears that were being felt um but I
 
00:55:27.789 --> 00:55:27.799 align:start position:0%
mean I guess language that this is these
 
00:55:30.390 --> 00:55:30.400 align:start position:0%
are just examples but that's no clearer
 
00:55:32.510 --> 00:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
if you're just saying here's a bunch of
 
00:55:33.870 --> 00:55:33.880 align:start position:0%
examples but those aren't all of them
 
00:55:35.910 --> 00:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's really just the same way to
 
00:55:39.950 --> 00:55:39.960 align:start position:0%
say including but not limited to so I I
 
00:55:42.069 --> 00:55:42.079 align:start position:0%
I'd be open if you have other language
 
00:55:44.910 --> 00:55:44.920 align:start position:0%
or or whatever that that that is the the
 
00:55:47.309 --> 00:55:47.319 align:start position:0%
problem you're trying to address the for
 
00:55:50.069 --> 00:55:50.079 align:start position:0%
example I I the only reason I brought up
 
00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
the four example language is we all I
 
00:55:55.750 --> 00:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
certainly as a lawyer they as lawyers
 
00:55:58.069 --> 00:55:58.079 align:start position:0%
all of you who've worked on drafting and
 
00:56:00.589 --> 00:56:00.599 align:start position:0%
legislation like this we all understand
 
00:56:03.309 --> 00:56:03.319 align:start position:0%
what including but not limited to means
 
00:56:05.349 --> 00:56:05.359 align:start position:0%
I think that language just goes right by
 
00:56:07.710 --> 00:56:07.720 align:start position:0%
people's head who are reading it so I
 
00:56:11.390 --> 00:56:11.400 align:start position:0%
you know the for example language
 
00:56:16.349 --> 00:56:16.359 align:start position:0%
uh the people the parents who who are
 
00:56:18.910 --> 00:56:18.920 align:start position:0%
subject to this understand that it's
 
00:56:20.309 --> 00:56:20.319 align:start position:0%
just a language thing but I think it's
 
00:56:22.150 --> 00:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
an important one the for example
 
00:56:24.990 --> 00:56:25.000 align:start position:0%
language what I I believe it was EG to
 
00:56:26.829 --> 00:56:26.839 align:start position:0%
begin with the I don't know if what you
 
00:56:30.710 --> 00:56:30.720 align:start position:0%
read it had an EG which EG is even worse
 
00:56:34.109 --> 00:56:34.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:36.710 --> 00:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
that so I just need to remind everyone
 
00:56:38.349 --> 00:56:38.359 align:start position:0%
that everything has to go through the
 
00:56:41.349 --> 00:56:41.359 align:start position:0%
chair okay that is out of respect for
 
00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
her so these conversations you can't
 
00:56:45.950 --> 00:56:45.960 align:start position:0%
just speak up like that she is the
 
00:56:48.589 --> 00:56:48.599 align:start position:0%
chairwoman okay thank
 
00:56:52.150 --> 00:56:52.160 align:start position:0%
you thank you um I think you know the
 
00:56:55.069 --> 00:56:55.079 align:start position:0%
more that I hear and and I did pour over
 
00:56:57.190 --> 00:56:57.200 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:56:59.309 --> 00:56:59.319 align:start position:0%
uh Senator Carson's work their committee
 
00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:02.480 align:start position:0%
and certainly this was a lot of ours um
 
00:57:03.950 --> 00:57:03.960 align:start position:0%
representative McMahon is on our
 
00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
committee you know he worked very hard
 
00:57:07.829 --> 00:57:07.839 align:start position:0%
on that I think what happens is and this
 
00:57:11.510 --> 00:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
is pretty typical in today's society is
 
00:57:14.670 --> 00:57:14.680 align:start position:0%
that our first shot at this came out OS
 
00:57:17.390 --> 00:57:17.400 align:start position:0%
did not give us back what we gave them
 
00:57:18.589 --> 00:57:18.599 align:start position:0%
and you know that led to some
 
00:57:20.589 --> 00:57:20.599 align:start position:0%
misconceptions certainly out in the
 
00:57:23.789 --> 00:57:23.799 align:start position:0%
public um and then those that little
 
00:57:25.430 --> 00:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
that little snowflake it turns into a
 
00:57:27.430 --> 00:57:27.440 align:start position:0%
snowball and then we continue on so a
 
00:57:28.910 --> 00:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
lot of this is having these
 
00:57:31.309 --> 00:57:31.319 align:start position:0%
conversations to help people understand
 
00:57:33.710 --> 00:57:33.720 align:start position:0%
what this is and what this is not this
 
00:57:36.789 --> 00:57:36.799 align:start position:0%
is not in any way punitive this is not
 
00:57:40.270 --> 00:57:40.280 align:start position:0%
in any way um you know the
 
00:57:43.109 --> 00:57:43.119 align:start position:0%
final say on now you get your kids taken
 
00:57:44.270 --> 00:57:44.280 align:start position:0%
away or anything else and we've already
 
00:57:45.990 --> 00:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
discussed this but I don't think it can
 
00:57:49.589 --> 00:57:49.599 align:start position:0%
be said enough so I understand with
 
00:57:51.470 --> 00:57:51.480 align:start position:0%
specific language and I did read in
 
00:57:54.270 --> 00:57:54.280 align:start position:0%
their report why they did not get so
 
00:57:56.589 --> 00:57:56.599 align:start position:0%
specific with some of that because part
 
00:57:58.230 --> 00:57:58.240 align:start position:0%
of this is in the training these are
 
00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
bills that we also have you know what
 
00:58:03.029 --> 00:58:03.039 align:start position:0%
does training look like what does um you
 
00:58:04.910 --> 00:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
know what
 
00:58:08.430 --> 00:58:08.440 align:start position:0%
uh what um gosh what I can't think I'm
 
00:58:11.430 --> 00:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
can't think of it right now uh what DCF
 
00:58:12.910 --> 00:58:12.920 align:start position:0%
is able to do what the office of the
 
00:58:14.670 --> 00:58:14.680 align:start position:0%
child advocate what they're directed to
 
00:58:16.829 --> 00:58:16.839 align:start position:0%
do all of these things fall in line This
 
00:58:18.710 --> 00:58:18.720 align:start position:0%
is not while this is a foundation this
 
00:58:20.750 --> 00:58:20.760 align:start position:0%
is not the end all on what we're going
 
00:58:22.990 --> 00:58:23.000 align:start position:0%
to do with it certainly things come
 
00:58:26.270 --> 00:58:26.280 align:start position:0%
after that so I do want to be super min
 
00:58:27.950 --> 00:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
ful because I do know that they talked
 
00:58:31.109 --> 00:58:31.119 align:start position:0%
about why they didn't have um things
 
00:58:33.829 --> 00:58:33.839 align:start position:0%
listed and it really is because of you
 
00:58:35.109 --> 00:58:35.119 align:start position:0%
know because they did have that in there
 
00:58:37.109 --> 00:58:37.119 align:start position:0%
first I think actually representative
 
00:58:38.589 --> 00:58:38.599 align:start position:0%
McMahon was one that you know was
 
00:58:40.750 --> 00:58:40.760 align:start position:0%
talking about that pretty specifically
 
00:58:42.589 --> 00:58:42.599 align:start position:0%
and also came to the realization that
 
00:58:43.910 --> 00:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
when they started doing that there was
 
00:58:46.430 --> 00:58:46.440 align:start position:0%
an issue so I think that we could look
 
00:58:48.630 --> 00:58:48.640 align:start position:0%
at if there's something more specific or
 
00:58:50.470 --> 00:58:50.480 align:start position:0%
putting it in a different area what is
 
00:58:52.150 --> 00:58:52.160 align:start position:0%
already defined that's the other thing
 
00:58:55.230 --> 00:58:55.240 align:start position:0%
too when we look at this this bill I
 
00:58:57.190 --> 00:58:57.200 align:start position:0%
think sometimes people see one section
 
00:58:59.150 --> 00:58:59.160 align:start position:0%
of it and you really have to read it in
 
00:59:00.990 --> 00:59:01.000 align:start position:0%
its entirety and I know that you all
 
00:59:02.430 --> 00:59:02.440 align:start position:0%
have I know that you've done your due
 
00:59:04.309 --> 00:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
diligence on that and I appreciate all
 
00:59:07.349 --> 00:59:07.359 align:start position:0%
of your work on that um and and that's
 
00:59:09.069 --> 00:59:09.079 align:start position:0%
part of our our issue right now but
 
00:59:11.069 --> 00:59:11.079 align:start position:0%
certainly if we you know can maybe
 
00:59:12.990 --> 00:59:13.000 align:start position:0%
outline it in another section as well
 
00:59:15.230 --> 00:59:15.240 align:start position:0%
that would be good but um I do think we
 
00:59:17.309 --> 00:59:17.319 align:start position:0%
have agreement that we need an amendment
 
00:59:18.829 --> 00:59:18.839 align:start position:0%
certainly we want to have more trauma in
 
00:59:21.309 --> 00:59:21.319 align:start position:0%
form language that's um we want to be
 
00:59:24.349 --> 00:59:24.359 align:start position:0%
sensitive to that um and I think that we
 
00:59:27.470 --> 00:59:27.480 align:start position:0%
could um look the definitions with
 
00:59:30.829 --> 00:59:30.839 align:start position:0%
office of child advocate this week if um
 
00:59:32.670 --> 00:59:32.680 align:start position:0%
representative deimon and Nelson if you
 
00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to talk to them and then you
 
00:59:37.150 --> 00:59:37.160 align:start position:0%
could put forth the amendment if you'd
 
00:59:40.349 --> 00:59:40.359 align:start position:0%
like um if you come up with one I just I
 
00:59:41.789 --> 00:59:41.799 align:start position:0%
know that we're all hearing from a lot
 
00:59:43.349 --> 00:59:43.359 align:start position:0%
of different sources and we're getting a
 
00:59:44.950 --> 00:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
lot of different emails and a lot of the
 
00:59:47.309 --> 00:59:47.319 align:start position:0%
fears that we're hearing are unfounded I
 
00:59:50.270 --> 00:59:50.280 align:start position:0%
will say that they are just you know
 
00:59:53.150 --> 00:59:53.160 align:start position:0%
misconceptions about what we have here
 
00:59:55.870 --> 00:59:55.880 align:start position:0%
so um you know it's it's hard to put it
 
00:59:57.630 --> 00:59:57.640 align:start position:0%
all it's that toothpaste it's hard to
 
00:59:59.750 --> 00:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
put all back in the tube once it's out
 
01:00:01.349 --> 01:00:01.359 align:start position:0%
but we're trying to figure out how to
 
01:00:02.829 --> 01:00:02.839 align:start position:0%
mitigate this for people because I don't
 
01:00:04.349 --> 01:00:04.359 align:start position:0%
want people to be afraid they're going
 
01:00:05.910 --> 01:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
to lose their kids we have a lot of
 
01:00:07.589 --> 01:00:07.599 align:start position:0%
really great parents in the granite
 
01:00:09.630 --> 01:00:09.640 align:start position:0%
state and we have a lot of parents who
 
01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
want to be great parents um but they
 
01:00:13.829 --> 01:00:13.839 align:start position:0%
just need the help to become great
 
01:00:15.430 --> 01:00:15.440 align:start position:0%
parents and so I want to make sure that
 
01:00:17.270 --> 01:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
we're including all of them did you have
 
01:00:20.470 --> 01:00:20.480 align:start position:0%
something and I would just like to um
 
01:00:22.349 --> 01:00:22.359 align:start position:0%
reiterate that this is about
 
01:00:24.630 --> 01:00:24.640 align:start position:0%
intervention right they're not coming in
 
01:00:28.470 --> 01:00:28.480 align:start position:0%
to take your children if you if they see
 
01:00:31.589 --> 01:00:31.599 align:start position:0%
that you you need help or guidance in an
 
01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:34.440 align:start position:0%
area they can provide those services to
 
01:00:37.950 --> 01:00:37.960 align:start position:0%
you but they're not coming in to rip
 
01:00:40.069 --> 01:00:40.079 align:start position:0%
your children out these are the days of
 
01:00:43.589 --> 01:00:43.599 align:start position:0%
the old system we have done so much work
 
01:00:46.789 --> 01:00:46.799 align:start position:0%
over the years to keep families together
 
01:00:49.589 --> 01:00:49.599 align:start position:0%
because we know that that's what's best
 
01:00:52.470 --> 01:00:52.480 align:start position:0%
for those kids even the most abused
 
01:00:54.470 --> 01:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
child will want to stay with their
 
01:00:58.109 --> 01:00:58.119 align:start position:0%
parent and sometimes can do more harm to
 
01:01:00.589 --> 01:01:00.599 align:start position:0%
pull them out of that home than to keep
 
01:01:02.789 --> 01:01:02.799 align:start position:0%
them in it so these are things that we
 
01:01:05.069 --> 01:01:05.079 align:start position:0%
have to remember you know there were the
 
01:01:08.789 --> 01:01:08.799 align:start position:0%
old days these are the new days where we
 
01:01:11.950 --> 01:01:11.960 align:start position:0%
are focusing on keeping families
 
01:01:13.750 --> 01:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
together I
 
01:01:19.710 --> 01:01:19.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:24.190 --> 01:01:24.200 align:start position:0%
you I Echo those sentiments exactly the
 
01:01:26.589 --> 01:01:26.599 align:start position:0%
good news/bad news is that people are
 
01:01:30.150 --> 01:01:30.160 align:start position:0%
really being being focused on um that
 
01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:31.309 align:start position:0%
really being being focused on um that
one

01:01:31.309 --> 01:01:31.319 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:01:35.029 --> 01:01:35.039 align:start position:0%
section and I say good news bad news the
 
01:01:36.789 --> 01:01:36.799 align:start position:0%
bad news is people don't have a
 
01:01:40.309 --> 01:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
conception as to actually what emotional
 
01:01:43.950 --> 01:01:43.960 align:start position:0%
abuse is and the reason for that is
 
01:01:48.029 --> 01:01:48.039 align:start position:0%
because most people don't see it they
 
01:01:51.109 --> 01:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
don't see the result in the child you
 
01:01:55.230 --> 01:01:55.240 align:start position:0%
cannot always see a broken heart the
 
01:01:59.670 --> 01:01:59.680 align:start position:0%
good news is that we do have specific
 
01:02:02.910 --> 01:02:02.920 align:start position:0%
criteria that we can amend the bill to
 
01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:04.670 align:start position:0%
criteria that we can amend the bill to
speak

01:02:04.670 --> 01:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
speak
 
01:02:09.829 --> 01:02:09.839 align:start position:0%
to we as a society many many many of us
 
01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
are coming out of a generation where all
 
01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:18.640 align:start position:0%
of this abuse was so
 
01:02:21.269 --> 01:02:21.279 align:start position:0%
prevalent we didn't even know we were
 
01:02:21.279 --> 01:02:22.549 align:start position:0%
prevalent we didn't even know we were
being

01:02:22.549 --> 01:02:22.559 align:start position:0%
being
 
01:02:26.950 --> 01:02:26.960 align:start position:0%
abused so if what how many of you here
 
01:02:31.390 --> 01:02:31.400 align:start position:0%
well I turned out all right uh Maybe not
 
01:02:33.589 --> 01:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
maybe not so much I was a hot mess
 
01:02:39.510 --> 01:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
before therapy Bingo as was I as was I
 
01:02:43.390 --> 01:02:43.400 align:start position:0%
so if we can pass this bill which and it
 
01:02:45.150 --> 01:02:45.160 align:start position:0%
it's the same as what we're dealing with
 
01:02:49.069 --> 01:02:49.079 align:start position:0%
right now with kids who are involved in
 
01:02:52.230 --> 01:02:52.240 align:start position:0%
um a multitude of issues like drug
 
01:02:57.069 --> 01:02:57.079 align:start position:0%
addiction and um violence and being
 
01:03:01.309 --> 01:03:01.319 align:start position:0%
thieves and whatnot when we started
 
01:03:01.319 --> 01:03:05.029 align:start position:0%
thieves and whatnot when we started
having

01:03:05.029 --> 01:03:05.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:09.190 --> 01:03:09.200 align:start position:0%
um agencies that would put kids through
 
01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:10.430 align:start position:0%
um agencies that would put kids through
challenge

01:03:10.430 --> 01:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
challenge
 
01:03:14.470 --> 01:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
programs a and so forth and so on we
 
01:03:18.109 --> 01:03:18.119 align:start position:0%
started teaching the children in a nice
 
01:03:21.670 --> 01:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
way an easy to understand way their
 
01:03:24.269 --> 01:03:24.279 align:start position:0%
behavior was wrong and now the state's
 
01:03:27.109 --> 01:03:27.119 align:start position:0%
focus is more on
 
01:03:31.230 --> 01:03:31.240 align:start position:0%
intervention so if we have this bill
 
01:03:37.510 --> 01:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:39.990 --> 01:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
definition zero
 
01:03:43.630 --> 01:03:43.640 align:start position:0%
consequences in this bill because the
 
01:03:46.150 --> 01:03:46.160 align:start position:0%
consequences if you break the law are
 
01:03:49.670 --> 01:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
already there but understanding that
 
01:03:52.109 --> 01:03:52.119 align:start position:0%
this is all for
 
01:03:56.150 --> 01:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
intervention it it it is
 
01:03:57.990 --> 01:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
then we go to the
 
01:04:00.190 --> 01:04:00.200 align:start position:0%
prevention and and that's what this is
 
01:04:02.269 --> 01:04:02.279 align:start position:0%
about so I agree with you there and I
 
01:04:05.269 --> 01:04:05.279 align:start position:0%
think that a small
 
01:04:08.069 --> 01:04:08.079 align:start position:0%
Amendment to the bill
 
01:04:10.990 --> 01:04:11.000 align:start position:0%
to just
 
01:04:14.950 --> 01:04:14.960 align:start position:0%
Define the emotional abuse
 
01:04:19.109 --> 01:04:19.119 align:start position:0%
aspect but not limited
 
01:04:21.349 --> 01:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
to will bring
 
01:04:24.430 --> 01:04:24.440 align:start position:0%
us right into this
 
01:04:26.710 --> 01:04:26.720 align:start position:0%
century and it it's going to help the
 
01:04:28.910 --> 01:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
kids stay with their parents and it's
 
01:04:30.190 --> 01:04:30.200 align:start position:0%
going to help
 
01:04:34.029 --> 01:04:34.039 align:start position:0%
parents be able to love and and adore
 
01:04:37.069 --> 01:04:37.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:41.069 --> 01:04:41.079 align:start position:0%
more um so thank you and I think that we
 
01:04:42.549 --> 01:04:42.559 align:start position:0%
will be talking to you so we already
 
01:04:45.829 --> 01:04:45.839 align:start position:0%
have um a motion in a second to have an
 
01:04:48.829 --> 01:04:48.839 align:start position:0%
amendment um before we can close though
 
01:04:50.589 --> 01:04:50.599 align:start position:0%
so we do understand that we're going to
 
01:04:52.710 --> 01:04:52.720 align:start position:0%
be working on this and and have that
 
01:04:56.510 --> 01:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
before we have the um
 
01:05:00.670 --> 01:05:00.680 align:start position:0%
exact session on it it's a Monday um lot
 
01:05:03.470 --> 01:05:03.480 align:start position:0%
going got lot going through my head um
 
01:05:05.789 --> 01:05:05.799 align:start position:0%
we do need a motion on how we feel about
 
01:05:07.510 --> 01:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
this bill whether our recommendation
 
01:05:10.069 --> 01:05:10.079 align:start position:0%
will be OTP otpa so we'll have to have a
 
01:05:12.269 --> 01:05:12.279 align:start position:0%
motion in a second and a vote on
 
01:05:16.950 --> 01:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
thepa okay vpa second okay um all in
 
01:05:20.630 --> 01:05:20.640 align:start position:0%
favor I all opposed okay so that will be
 
01:05:22.950 --> 01:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
our recommendation um thank you all this
 
01:05:26.390 --> 01:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
has been hundreds of hours for
 
01:05:28.190 --> 01:05:28.200 align:start position:0%
I think we're over a hundred people now
 
01:05:30.510 --> 01:05:30.520 align:start position:0%
and we are really trying to get it right
 
01:05:33.309 --> 01:05:33.319 align:start position:0%
um for the kids so and that's really the
 
01:05:35.990 --> 01:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
the basis of our uh committee is to get
 
01:05:38.109 --> 01:05:38.119 align:start position:0%
it right for the kids and make sure that
 
01:05:41.910 --> 01:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
