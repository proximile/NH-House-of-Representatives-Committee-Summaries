00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 align:start position:0%
the hearing for the finance committee
 
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 align:start position:0%
and will then go into recess we have
 
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 align:start position:0%
some members running late we want to
 
00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
make sure everybody arrives and gets to
 
00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 align:start position:0%
vote on these six bills that we have
 
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
before us I don't think it's too
 
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 align:start position:0%
controversial some of the bills were
 
00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 align:start position:0%
unanimous so out of the division so I
 
00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
don't think we'll have a lot of
 
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 align:start position:0%
discussion so hopefully
 
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
we'll take a 30-minute recess to wait
 
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
for the arrival of of some of our
 
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
members that
 
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 align:start position:0%
either left early or left late or uh
 
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
told us they couldn't make it on time
 
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 align:start position:0%
so yeah right
 
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
so we are in recess I hope to return
 
00:33:00.889 --> 00:33:00.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:04.140 align:start position:0%
the recess I'm told that representative
 
00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
Bean is on his way
 
00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:08.940 align:start position:0%
and we'll begin with the we have six
 
00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:11.640 align:start position:0%
bills on the docket for today beginning
 
00:33:14.289 --> 00:33:14.299 align:start position:0%
with division one I'll recognize
 
00:33:17.149 --> 00:33:17.159 align:start position:0%
representative leishman
 
00:33:17.159 --> 00:33:18.529 align:start position:0%
representative leishman
foreign

00:33:18.529 --> 00:33:18.539 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:20.700 align:start position:0%
thanks Mr chairman and good morning I'd
 
00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
just like to turn this over to
 
00:33:24.049 --> 00:33:24.059 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire who will speak
 
00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
briefly to the unanimous decision of the
 
00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:29.940 align:start position:0%
division to retain the bill
 
00:33:32.930 --> 00:33:32.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and Mr chairman
 
00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
um so I'd like to move to retain Senate
 
00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:43.549 --> 00:33:43.559 align:start position:0%
okay so this is a bill
 
00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
um that moves spending for
 
00:33:50.049 --> 00:33:50.059 align:start position:0%
legal services for those who are
 
00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:52.640 align:start position:0%
involuntarily committed
 
00:33:55.930 --> 00:33:55.940 align:start position:0%
for mental care
 
00:33:59.450 --> 00:33:59.460 align:start position:0%
from the spending is currently in the
 
00:34:01.009 --> 00:34:01.019 align:start position:0%
health and human services department
 
00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:04.260 align:start position:0%
this moves it to the judicial Council
 
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
and when when we heard the the testimony
 
00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:08.820 align:start position:0%
on the bill
 
00:34:11.930 --> 00:34:11.940 align:start position:0%
it was extremely lukewarm I would say
 
00:34:14.629 --> 00:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
you know the the motivation for doing
 
00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:17.820 align:start position:0%
this uh you know the sponsor didn't show
 
00:34:19.849 --> 00:34:19.859 align:start position:0%
up the motivation for doing it was
 
00:34:22.669 --> 00:34:22.679 align:start position:0%
somewhat unclear and uh representative
 
00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:25.800 align:start position:0%
Griffin uh pointed out that it's
 
00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:29.820 align:start position:0%
possible that as when this this item is
 
00:34:32.869 --> 00:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
part of Health and Human Services that
 
00:34:36.409 --> 00:34:36.419 align:start position:0%
there's matching funds available in that
 
00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
under that venue but if it were moved to
 
00:34:40.849 --> 00:34:40.859 align:start position:0%
judicial Council it's possible that
 
00:34:42.889 --> 00:34:42.899 align:start position:0%
there would not be right it's likely
 
00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:45.720 align:start position:0%
that there would not be in that case so
 
00:34:48.649 --> 00:34:48.659 align:start position:0%
you know this could be a significant
 
00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
cost increase for what seemed to us to
 
00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.369 align:start position:0%
cost increase for what seemed to us to
be

00:34:52.369 --> 00:34:52.379 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:34:52.379 --> 00:34:53.470 align:start position:0%
be
um

00:34:53.470 --> 00:34:53.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:57.829 --> 00:34:57.839 align:start position:0%
not really a strong benefit and so we
 
00:34:59.690 --> 00:34:59.700 align:start position:0%
really want to make sure and no one from
 
00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:01.500 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services came to talk
 
00:35:03.829 --> 00:35:03.839 align:start position:0%
to us so we really want to make sure
 
00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
that that's not the case before we we
 
00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:08.820 align:start position:0%
let this go so we we need more info
 
00:35:10.490 --> 00:35:10.500 align:start position:0%
information and that's why we're
 
00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:12.660 align:start position:0%
retaining them
 
00:35:14.329 --> 00:35:14.339 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
representative hole thank you Mr
 
00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:17.690 align:start position:0%
representative hole thank you Mr
chairman

00:35:17.690 --> 00:35:17.700 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:35:20.930 --> 00:35:20.940 align:start position:0%
so do those who are committed today have
 
00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
access to Legal Services it's just
 
00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
funded just for clarity right it's just
 
00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
funded through DHHS instead
 
00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:31.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:34.140 align:start position:0%
and for those not familiar with judicial
 
00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:37.020 align:start position:0%
Council we start off with very little in
 
00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:39.960 align:start position:0%
their budget they come to fiscal for all
 
00:35:42.410 --> 00:35:42.420 align:start position:0%
their their needs and they come almost
 
00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:45.420 align:start position:0%
every meeting as as money is needed to
 
00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:48.540 align:start position:0%
hire the uh Indigent Council and so on
 
00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:50.700 align:start position:0%
so it'd be the same thing representative
 
00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:51.770 align:start position:0%
so it'd be the same thing representative
Griffin

00:35:51.770 --> 00:35:51.780 align:start position:0%

00:35:54.890 --> 00:35:54.900 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair
 
00:35:58.609 --> 00:35:58.619 align:start position:0%
we also heard from the judicial Council
 
00:36:02.450 --> 00:36:02.460 align:start position:0%
and uh the estimated number of cases
 
00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:06.540 align:start position:0%
here runs somewhere from 2200 to 2500
 
00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:07.730 align:start position:0%
here runs somewhere from 2200 to 2500
Plus

00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:07.740 align:start position:0%
Plus
 
00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
and the judicial Council right now
 
00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:12.780 align:start position:0%
consists of three people
 
00:36:15.050 --> 00:36:15.060 align:start position:0%
and they said they would be absolutely
 
00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:16.550 align:start position:0%
and they said they would be absolutely
overwhelmed

00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed
 
00:36:20.810 --> 00:36:20.820 align:start position:0%
to take on the added caseload so that
 
00:36:23.329 --> 00:36:23.339 align:start position:0%
was another major reason for retaining
 
00:36:27.170 --> 00:36:27.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:30.720 align:start position:0%

00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:41.880 align:start position:0%
see no further discussion
 
00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
the clerk will call the roll on motion
 
00:36:46.490 --> 00:36:46.500 align:start position:0%

00:39:19.250 --> 00:39:19.260 align:start position:0%
so Senate bill
 
00:39:24.770 --> 00:39:24.780 align:start position:0%
um 204 is uh directs the state to put
 
00:39:29.930 --> 00:39:29.940 align:start position:0%
trauma kits into state-owned buildings a
 
00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
trauma kit is like a specialized first
 
00:39:37.250 --> 00:39:37.260 align:start position:0%
aid kit that specifically designed to
 
00:39:41.089 --> 00:39:41.099 align:start position:0%
um to help someone who is massively
 
00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
bleeding bleeding very quickly so it it
 
00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:46.680 align:start position:0%
contains two main elements one is a
 
00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
tourniquet and one is what's called it
 
00:39:51.829 --> 00:39:51.839 align:start position:0%
an Israeli compression bandage it's a
 
00:39:54.589 --> 00:39:54.599 align:start position:0%
very large bandage that puts pressure on
 
00:39:57.410 --> 00:39:57.420 align:start position:0%
a large wound and so
 
00:39:57.420 --> 00:39:58.310 align:start position:0%
a large wound and so
um

00:39:58.310 --> 00:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:00.290 --> 00:40:00.300 align:start position:0%
and the kit has a few other things but
 
00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:02.700 align:start position:0%
that's the main thing it's it's for it's
 
00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:03.829 align:start position:0%
that's the main thing it's it's for it's
for

00:40:03.829 --> 00:40:03.839 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
use when when the EMTs are a little too
 
00:40:10.370 --> 00:40:10.380 align:start position:0%
far away to to help someone who's who's
 
00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
significantly bleeding and
 
00:40:17.210 --> 00:40:17.220 align:start position:0%
um the the the amendment makes a few
 
00:40:19.730 --> 00:40:19.740 align:start position:0%
improvements to the bill for one thing
 
00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:22.040 align:start position:0%
the bill was originally specified
 
00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:25.260 align:start position:0%
state-owned buildings but we have a lot
 
00:40:27.890 --> 00:40:27.900 align:start position:0%
of buildings that are State occupied
 
00:40:29.870 --> 00:40:29.880 align:start position:0%
particularly things like liquor stores
 
00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:33.240 align:start position:0%
and other buildings that are leased and
 
00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
those could benefit from having these
 
00:40:38.690 --> 00:40:38.700 align:start position:0%
kind of kits as well so we added that
 
00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
um the the
 
00:40:44.210 --> 00:40:44.220 align:start position:0%
um the original Bill had a section that
 
00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:47.700 align:start position:0%
was a little bit Overkill we felt it it
 
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
created a committee of EMTs to create a
 
00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:53.640 align:start position:0%
list of buildings and so on but it turns
 
00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:55.800 align:start position:0%
out the people that that normally deal
 
00:40:58.550 --> 00:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
with facilities and buildings is the
 
00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
Department of administrative services so
 
00:41:02.569 --> 00:41:02.579 align:start position:0%
we changed the bill to have the
 
00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:05.060 align:start position:0%
department of administrative Services
 
00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
handle the distribution and the you know
 
00:41:10.310 --> 00:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
purchasing and distribution of the kits
 
00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
in can and let them consult with the
 
00:41:16.490 --> 00:41:16.500 align:start position:0%
Emergency Services
 
00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
um section of safety and then the the
 
00:41:22.849 --> 00:41:22.859 align:start position:0%
final thing was the money
 
00:41:25.849 --> 00:41:25.859 align:start position:0%
um the bill originally simply had a
 
00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:27.480 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund that it could accept
 
00:41:30.109 --> 00:41:30.119 align:start position:0%
gifts and grants but but it didn't
 
00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:32.220 align:start position:0%
actually put any money in the fund so
 
00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:33.960 align:start position:0%
therefore it wouldn't have acquired the
 
00:41:36.770 --> 00:41:36.780 align:start position:0%
kits until such gifts and grants showed
 
00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:39.180 align:start position:0%
up but the the amount of money here is
 
00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
relatively small so we changed it so to
 
00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:45.540 align:start position:0%
to eliminate the dedicated fund and to
 
00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
allocate fifty thousand dollars for the
 
00:41:50.690 --> 00:41:50.700 align:start position:0%
purpose that should get us somewhere
 
00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
around 250 buildings
 
00:41:59.210 --> 00:41:59.220 align:start position:0%
supplied and so if necessary to go from
 
00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
there then future budgets could could
 
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:07.370 --> 00:42:07.380 align:start position:0%
any questions on the amendment
 
00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:09.540 align:start position:0%
representative hole
 
00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:11.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:42:13.069 --> 00:42:13.079 align:start position:0%
um line 30 right section does not apply
 
00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:14.460 align:start position:0%
to state-owned buildings that are is
 
00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:16.680 align:start position:0%
vacant or under construction should that
 
00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:19.980 align:start position:0%
be broader to than just vacant
 
00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:21.109 align:start position:0%
be broader to than just vacant
um

00:42:21.109 --> 00:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:23.930 --> 00:42:23.940 align:start position:0%
for it we discussed earlier maybe things
 
00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:25.490 align:start position:0%
for it we discussed earlier maybe things
like

00:42:25.490 --> 00:42:25.500 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:42:27.109 --> 00:42:27.119 align:start position:0%
um at the sununu center their storage
 
00:42:30.650 --> 00:42:30.660 align:start position:0%
buildings is that under vacant
 
00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:33.720 align:start position:0%
um how are we defining bacon I guess
 
00:42:35.930 --> 00:42:35.940 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for the question this is
 
00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
a line that's unchanged from the the
 
00:42:41.810 --> 00:42:41.820 align:start position:0%
amendment just for clarity is is a
 
00:42:44.210 --> 00:42:44.220 align:start position:0%
replace all but this particular line is
 
00:42:46.849 --> 00:42:46.859 align:start position:0%
unchanged from the original Bill and and
 
00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
basically these kits are most useful
 
00:42:50.930 --> 00:42:50.940 align:start position:0%
when there's a lot of people around
 
00:42:54.349 --> 00:42:54.359 align:start position:0%
right so so places that are vacant or
 
00:42:57.589 --> 00:42:57.599 align:start position:0%
otherwise rarely used uh you know it's
 
00:43:00.290 --> 00:43:00.300 align:start position:0%
less useful
 
00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:02.230 align:start position:0%
less useful
oh

00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:02.240 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:03.780 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards and
 
00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
representative Carol McGuire uh thank
 
00:43:10.130 --> 00:43:10.140 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair uh I I have a few but I'll
 
00:43:14.569 --> 00:43:14.579 align:start position:0%
just uh go at your leisure uh the
 
00:43:14.579 --> 00:43:15.170 align:start position:0%
just uh go at your leisure uh the
um

00:43:15.170 --> 00:43:15.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:18.410 --> 00:43:18.420 align:start position:0%
first thing I I'm curious about is this
 
00:43:21.109 --> 00:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
is a very small list of medical items
 
00:43:22.849 --> 00:43:22.859 align:start position:0%
that would be in there and it's mostly
 
00:43:25.730 --> 00:43:25.740 align:start position:0%
stop the bleeding kinds of things are
 
00:43:28.970 --> 00:43:28.980 align:start position:0%
there any of these components that have
 
00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
an expiration date that they have a term
 
00:43:36.170 --> 00:43:36.180 align:start position:0%
at which they need to be rotated and did
 
00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:39.960 align:start position:0%
you give consideration for those on uh
 
00:43:43.370 --> 00:43:43.380 align:start position:0%
who would be having unexpired items in
 
00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:45.480 align:start position:0%
this kit and who would be responsible
 
00:43:48.290 --> 00:43:48.300 align:start position:0%
for rotating the stock and how the old
 
00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
stuff would get disposed was there any
 
00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:52.140 align:start position:0%
thought about that
 
00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
um yes thank you for the question
 
00:43:55.970 --> 00:43:55.980 align:start position:0%
representative that did come up in our
 
00:43:59.450 --> 00:43:59.460 align:start position:0%
committee and we learned that these have
 
00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
a shelf life of of three to five years
 
00:44:05.329 --> 00:44:05.339 align:start position:0%
some of the items in the kit are
 
00:44:07.849 --> 00:44:07.859 align:start position:0%
one-time use only so like the tourniquet
 
00:44:10.309 --> 00:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
for example once you use it you need a
 
00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
new one
 
00:44:14.410 --> 00:44:14.420 align:start position:0%
um but because this
 
00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
uh this
 
00:44:19.550 --> 00:44:19.560 align:start position:0%
requirement is sort of a new requirement
 
00:44:24.589 --> 00:44:24.599 align:start position:0%
for das and their their Property
 
00:44:27.829 --> 00:44:27.839 align:start position:0%
Services area this would be an ongoing
 
00:44:29.569 --> 00:44:29.579 align:start position:0%
thing that they would have to they would
 
00:44:31.609 --> 00:44:31.619 align:start position:0%
have to keep track of we didn't
 
00:44:33.950 --> 00:44:33.960 align:start position:0%
explicitly put in the bill
 
00:44:36.530 --> 00:44:36.540 align:start position:0%
you know obviously this is something
 
00:44:37.849 --> 00:44:37.859 align:start position:0%
they would end up putting in their
 
00:44:39.530 --> 00:44:39.540 align:start position:0%
budget right so when they need to
 
00:44:42.109 --> 00:44:42.119 align:start position:0%
replace and and all that sort of thing
 
00:44:42.119 --> 00:44:43.790 align:start position:0%
replace and and all that sort of thing
follow-up

00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:43.800 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:48.060 align:start position:0%
um and then uh was there any estimate of
 
00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
how many times this might have been
 
00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:53.400 align:start position:0%
useful over the last 10 years in all
 
00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
state buildings is there any consumption
 
00:44:59.329 --> 00:44:59.339 align:start position:0%
rate uh assumption built into here
 
00:45:01.730 --> 00:45:01.740 align:start position:0%
um no we did not we did not hear that
 
00:45:03.829 --> 00:45:03.839 align:start position:0%
the only thing related to that that we
 
00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
heard is that and this was from the EMTs
 
00:45:10.970 --> 00:45:10.980 align:start position:0%
that that there were basically two sorts
 
00:45:15.290 --> 00:45:15.300 align:start position:0%
of conditions that that happened that
 
00:45:17.450 --> 00:45:17.460 align:start position:0%
the EMTs can't get there quick enough
 
00:45:21.589 --> 00:45:21.599 align:start position:0%
one of them is this severe bleeding and
 
00:45:23.569 --> 00:45:23.579 align:start position:0%
the other one is heart attacks and
 
00:45:25.609 --> 00:45:25.619 align:start position:0%
that's why we have these aeds the
 
00:45:28.309 --> 00:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
defibrillators right and so both of
 
00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
those are starting to get spread through
 
00:45:33.710 --> 00:45:33.720 align:start position:0%
the community in various ways but this
 
00:45:37.069 --> 00:45:37.079 align:start position:0%
is uh we did not hear about specific
 
00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:45.540 align:start position:0%
and and so was there discussion uh I
 
00:45:48.410 --> 00:45:48.420 align:start position:0%
think with the aeds that comes with a
 
00:45:50.210 --> 00:45:50.220 align:start position:0%
sort of an annual requirement for people
 
00:45:52.130 --> 00:45:52.140 align:start position:0%
that become familiar with that equipment
 
00:45:55.849 --> 00:45:55.859 align:start position:0%
uh it was there anything in this uh bill
 
00:45:59.150 --> 00:45:59.160 align:start position:0%
or your amendment to require stop the
 
00:46:01.490 --> 00:46:01.500 align:start position:0%
bleeding training
 
00:46:03.589 --> 00:46:03.599 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for the question
 
00:46:05.690 --> 00:46:05.700 align:start position:0%
um no there's there's requirement in
 
00:46:09.530 --> 00:46:09.540 align:start position:0%
here specifically for instruction uh
 
00:46:11.809 --> 00:46:11.819 align:start position:0%
material to be in the kit but there
 
00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
isn't the requirement for training
 
00:46:17.569 --> 00:46:17.579 align:start position:0%
all right thank thank you Mr chair I I
 
00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna end up being the only person
 
00:46:22.609 --> 00:46:22.619 align:start position:0%
voting no on this just just because of
 
00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
my health care background in the Army I
 
00:46:27.890 --> 00:46:27.900 align:start position:0%
I just don't see this as being practical
 
00:46:30.770 --> 00:46:30.780 align:start position:0%
in terms of being able to implement it
 
00:46:33.170 --> 00:46:33.180 align:start position:0%
and achieve the it's a great intent but
 
00:46:34.670 --> 00:46:34.680 align:start position:0%
I just I just don't see it being
 
00:46:37.730 --> 00:46:37.740 align:start position:0%
practical but thank you well some of
 
00:46:39.770 --> 00:46:39.780 align:start position:0%
these things could go in rules or in a
 
00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
bill next year
 
00:46:44.690 --> 00:46:44.700 align:start position:0%
represent Carol McGuire thank you Mr
 
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
chair the the this bill went through my
 
00:46:49.609 --> 00:46:49.619 align:start position:0%
committee first
 
00:46:52.609 --> 00:46:52.619 align:start position:0%
we got an estimate that the first wave
 
00:46:55.190 --> 00:46:55.200 align:start position:0%
of kits would cost something in the
 
00:46:57.829 --> 00:46:57.839 align:start position:0%
vicinity of five to ten thousand dollars
 
00:46:59.870 --> 00:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
depending on how much of a deal we could
 
00:47:02.270 --> 00:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
get for buying them in quantity
 
00:47:04.990 --> 00:47:05.000 align:start position:0%
and that it was
 
00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
the cheapest and easiest way to prevent
 
00:47:11.390 --> 00:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
the third major cause of death in New
 
00:47:15.349 --> 00:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire which is bleeding out so
 
00:47:19.069 --> 00:47:19.079 align:start position:0%
we were informed that if you call 9-1-1
 
00:47:22.490 --> 00:47:22.500 align:start position:0%
all of the dispatchers are fully trained
 
00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
and how to use these kits so you don't
 
00:47:25.370 --> 00:47:25.380 align:start position:0%
have to say well where's the
 
00:47:27.250 --> 00:47:27.260 align:start position:0%
instructions what do I do now
 
00:47:30.410 --> 00:47:30.420 align:start position:0%
it the use of these kits is also taught
 
00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:32.089 align:start position:0%
it the use of these kits is also taught
in

00:47:32.089 --> 00:47:32.099 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:47:35.450 --> 00:47:35.460 align:start position:0%
CPR and first aid in other places so
 
00:47:38.650 --> 00:47:38.660 align:start position:0%
it's not as rare as you might think and
 
00:47:42.349 --> 00:47:42.359 align:start position:0%
so we thought that even if it prevented
 
00:47:44.450 --> 00:47:44.460 align:start position:0%
one death
 
00:47:48.410 --> 00:47:48.420 align:start position:0%
from a tragic accident someone coming in
 
00:47:51.050 --> 00:47:51.060 align:start position:0%
and deciding to shoot up the DMV
 
00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
or something like that we said okay this
 
00:47:57.109 --> 00:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
this might prevent front to death at a
 
00:47:58.490 --> 00:47:58.500 align:start position:0%
very cheap price
 
00:48:01.609 --> 00:48:01.619 align:start position:0%
and it's something that the the
 
00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
buildings can keep on hand it doesn't go
 
00:48:08.089 --> 00:48:08.099 align:start position:0%
bad the expiration date on things like
 
00:48:11.630 --> 00:48:11.640 align:start position:0%
latex gloves I mean that's
 
00:48:13.730 --> 00:48:13.740 align:start position:0%
you could still use them after they've
 
00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
expired I imagine it's not it's not as
 
00:48:19.130 --> 00:48:19.140 align:start position:0%
critical as some other things that you
 
00:48:21.349 --> 00:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
have to replace immediately
 
00:48:24.290 --> 00:48:24.300 align:start position:0%
so that was why we were we thought it
 
00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:25.130 align:start position:0%
so that was why we were we thought it
was

00:48:25.130 --> 00:48:25.140 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:48:27.470 --> 00:48:27.480 align:start position:0%
getting an awful lot of bang for very
 
00:48:28.910 --> 00:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
little amount of money
 
00:48:30.770 --> 00:48:30.780 align:start position:0%
well we're glad you're here to add that
 
00:48:33.890 --> 00:48:33.900 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin when the EMTs
 
00:48:37.490 --> 00:48:37.500 align:start position:0%
were asked the question that uh
 
00:48:41.329 --> 00:48:41.339 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards raised they said
 
00:48:44.809 --> 00:48:44.819 align:start position:0%
the most important thing is if someone's
 
00:48:46.910 --> 00:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
on the phone with 9-1-1
 
00:48:49.250 --> 00:48:49.260 align:start position:0%
that this equipment be available because
 
00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
the people on 9-1-1 are trained to tell
 
00:48:55.490 --> 00:48:55.500 align:start position:0%
people over the phone how to use the
 
00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:57.829 align:start position:0%
people over the phone how to use the
equipment

00:48:57.829 --> 00:48:57.839 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
00:49:00.050 --> 00:49:00.060 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you Mr
 
00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
chairman the availability of these
 
00:49:04.430 --> 00:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
materials are definitely important I
 
00:49:06.410 --> 00:49:06.420 align:start position:0%
have a friend who lost his leg in combat
 
00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:08.640 align:start position:0%
and on his prosthetic he actually keeps
 
00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
the trauma kit bungeed on so that if
 
00:49:12.829 --> 00:49:12.839 align:start position:0%
somebody else is in a similar situation
 
00:49:15.170 --> 00:49:15.180 align:start position:0%
he has the tools on board so having
 
00:49:16.849 --> 00:49:16.859 align:start position:0%
these available for people should they
 
00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
be needed is is I think a low-cost way
 
00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:26.390 --> 00:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
further discussion on Amendment 2080
 
00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
everyone has a copy
 
00:49:32.510 --> 00:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
is a show of hand sufficient to adopt it
 
00:49:34.849 --> 00:49:34.859 align:start position:0%
all those in favor of adopting Amendment
 
00:49:34.859 --> 00:49:38.690 align:start position:0%

Senate bill 267. thank you Mr chairman
 
00:51:58.609 --> 00:51:58.619 align:start position:0%
I'd like to recognize representative
 
00:52:01.309 --> 00:52:01.319 align:start position:0%
Abel to speak to the division's vote to
 
00:52:03.470 --> 00:52:03.480 align:start position:0%
retain of seven to one
 
00:52:08.410 --> 00:52:08.420 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman um H SB
 
00:52:11.630 --> 00:52:11.640 align:start position:0%
267 is a little bit complicated to
 
00:52:14.690 --> 00:52:14.700 align:start position:0%
understand perhaps it helps if you um
 
00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
know that it started out Life as a bill
 
00:52:20.809 --> 00:52:20.819 align:start position:0%
that would have required Des to
 
00:52:25.130 --> 00:52:25.140 align:start position:0%
um issue regulations on Advanced
 
00:52:27.650 --> 00:52:27.660 align:start position:0%
recycling which you may remember that
 
00:52:31.849 --> 00:52:31.859 align:start position:0%
process from last year that we passed in
 
00:52:34.549 --> 00:52:34.559 align:start position:0%
conversations in the Senate it was
 
00:52:38.329 --> 00:52:38.339 align:start position:0%
decided that perhaps what one should
 
00:52:41.290 --> 00:52:41.300 align:start position:0%
look at is the cumulative
 
00:52:45.910 --> 00:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
impact of a bill such that was say admit
 
00:52:48.950 --> 00:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
emitting polluted air because the way
 
00:52:52.130 --> 00:52:52.140 align:start position:0%
permitting works right now in permitting
 
00:52:55.010 --> 00:52:55.020 align:start position:0%
by Des you're basically just looking at
 
00:52:57.589 --> 00:52:57.599 align:start position:0%
what potential sources of pollution are
 
00:52:59.470 --> 00:52:59.480 align:start position:0%
being emitted by that particular
 
00:53:02.630 --> 00:53:02.640 align:start position:0%
facility being permitted as opposed to
 
00:53:05.109 --> 00:53:05.119 align:start position:0%
the cumulative impacts of other
 
00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
facilities in the area
 
00:53:10.130 --> 00:53:10.140 align:start position:0%
so this bill
 
00:53:12.530 --> 00:53:12.540 align:start position:0%
um which passed with a very very strong
 
00:53:16.490 --> 00:53:16.500 align:start position:0%
vote on the house floor and 19-0 coming
 
00:53:19.609 --> 00:53:19.619 align:start position:0%
out of Ena would have required the
 
00:53:22.490 --> 00:53:22.500 align:start position:0%
commissioner of Des to consider a
 
00:53:26.589 --> 00:53:26.599 align:start position:0%
cumulative impacts analysis in rules and
 
00:53:29.450 --> 00:53:29.460 align:start position:0%
statutes and it would have authorized
 
00:53:32.809 --> 00:53:32.819 align:start position:0%
the hiring of someone to sort of look at
 
00:53:35.210 --> 00:53:35.220 align:start position:0%
existing rules and statutes and it was
 
00:53:38.210 --> 00:53:38.220 align:start position:0%
going to authorize the a scoping study
 
00:53:41.809 --> 00:53:41.819 align:start position:0%
and the ultimate idea was that the
 
00:53:46.150 --> 00:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
analysis would recommend any rules and
 
00:53:51.170 --> 00:53:51.180 align:start position:0%
potential legislation to require us to
 
00:53:53.690 --> 00:53:53.700 align:start position:0%
look at cumulative impacts of any
 
00:53:57.470 --> 00:53:57.480 align:start position:0%
facility that was permitted in
 
00:54:00.890 --> 00:54:00.900 align:start position:0%
discussions in the division we talked a
 
00:54:03.170 --> 00:54:03.180 align:start position:0%
little bit about what the word facility
 
00:54:07.370 --> 00:54:07.380 align:start position:0%
meant in the in the bill we talked some
 
00:54:10.510 --> 00:54:10.520 align:start position:0%
more about cumulative impacts and
 
00:54:14.390 --> 00:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
overall we felt like we really needed to
 
00:54:17.990 --> 00:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
look at it longer and so we decided to
 
00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:23.750 --> 00:54:23.760 align:start position:0%

it's one it's listed as 182 but the real
 
00:56:50.809 --> 00:56:50.819 align:start position:0%

um for for those who have not looked at
 
00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
this bill this is essentially uh
 
00:57:15.290 --> 00:57:15.300 align:start position:0%
extending the eligibility for Aid to
 
00:57:17.990 --> 00:57:18.000 align:start position:0%

00:57:29.450 --> 00:57:29.460 align:start position:0%
they step in to fulfill uh the role of a
 
00:57:32.210 --> 00:57:32.220 align:start position:0%
long list of people who are currently
 
00:57:35.930 --> 00:57:35.940 align:start position:0%
eligible if you looked at line nine you
 
00:57:37.849 --> 00:57:37.859 align:start position:0%
would see that current eligibility
 
00:57:40.490 --> 00:57:40.500 align:start position:0%
extends to fathers mothers grandfathers
 
00:57:42.109 --> 00:57:42.119 align:start position:0%
grandmothers brothers sisters
 
00:57:44.150 --> 00:57:44.160 align:start position:0%

stepsisters first cousins nephews or

niece uncles aunts and it adds court
 
00:57:53.809 --> 00:57:53.819 align:start position:0%
appointed Guardian this seems to be a
 
00:57:55.089 --> 00:57:55.099 align:start position:0%
very reasonable
 
00:57:57.829 --> 00:57:57.839 align:start position:0%
extension of eligibility requirements
 
00:58:04.730 --> 00:58:04.740 align:start position:0%

is um this is a friendly retention
 
01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:16.430 align:start position:0%
is um this is a friendly retention
effort

01:00:16.430 --> 01:00:16.440 align:start position:0%
effort
 
01:00:19.309 --> 01:00:19.319 align:start position:0%
um I've reached out to Senator Waters
 
01:00:22.789 --> 01:00:22.799 align:start position:0%
who came in and testified on this bill
 
01:00:24.890 --> 01:00:24.900 align:start position:0%
um and I've talked to a few other people
 
01:00:29.710 --> 01:00:29.720 align:start position:0%
this this bill uh does a a couple of
 
01:00:32.990 --> 01:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
new things or three three new things
 
01:00:35.870 --> 01:00:35.880 align:start position:0%
that cause some concern
 
01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
um and and and an interest in more
 
01:00:41.809 --> 01:00:41.819 align:start position:0%
Precision the first thing it does uh
 
01:00:44.510 --> 01:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
from my perspective that causes concern
 
01:00:50.710 --> 01:00:50.720 align:start position:0%
is on page four uh lines 20 21 and 22
 
01:00:55.250 --> 01:00:55.260 align:start position:0%
where we have had a Prohibition in our
 
01:00:57.730 --> 01:00:57.740 align:start position:0%
current law
 
01:00:59.809 --> 01:00:59.819 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
01:01:01.910 --> 01:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
say again oh should I stop or you no
 
01:01:04.370 --> 01:01:04.380 align:start position:0%
he's just getting sorry to interrupt no
 
01:01:06.890 --> 01:01:06.900 align:start position:0%
no no I'm I I just want to follow your
 
01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
lead so
 
01:01:11.450 --> 01:01:11.460 align:start position:0%
um what this does is in the current law
 
01:01:16.010 --> 01:01:16.020 align:start position:0%
we have had a the prohibition on using
 
01:01:19.750 --> 01:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
State money to pay for needle exchanges
 
01:01:22.789 --> 01:01:22.799 align:start position:0%
so so there have been some exception
 
01:01:25.069 --> 01:01:25.079 align:start position:0%
cases where we've specifically
 
01:01:27.530 --> 01:01:27.540 align:start position:0%
authorized State money for needle
 
01:01:29.750 --> 01:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
exchanges but this would get rid of sort
 
01:01:33.049 --> 01:01:33.059 align:start position:0%
of the blanket uh prohibition on use of
 
01:01:36.829 --> 01:01:36.839 align:start position:0%
State money and and I uh I I think we
 
01:01:39.289 --> 01:01:39.299 align:start position:0%
want to take a deeper look at that and
 
01:01:42.289 --> 01:01:42.299 align:start position:0%
see what the implications of of having
 
01:01:44.930 --> 01:01:44.940 align:start position:0%
State money spent in that manner would
 
01:01:49.190 --> 01:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
be uh my instinct says it's not good but
 
01:01:51.170 --> 01:01:51.180 align:start position:0%
there there will be a committee put
 
01:01:53.109 --> 01:01:53.119 align:start position:0%
together small work group
 
01:01:55.190 --> 01:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
led by
 
01:01:58.069 --> 01:01:58.079 align:start position:0%
um I've asked Dr David Nagel who's a
 
01:02:01.329 --> 01:02:01.339 align:start position:0%
national expert on opioid
 
01:02:04.910 --> 01:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
reduction in harm reduction to have him
 
01:02:06.770 --> 01:02:06.780 align:start position:0%
come in and basically take the
 
01:02:08.870 --> 01:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
intellectual lead on this there are a
 
01:02:11.630 --> 01:02:11.640 align:start position:0%
few other people waiting for Senator
 
01:02:14.289 --> 01:02:14.299 align:start position:0%
Waters to come in and nominate somebody
 
01:02:19.210 --> 01:02:19.220 align:start position:0%
the other two things it does is it um
 
01:02:22.609 --> 01:02:22.619 align:start position:0%
introduces kind of A New Concept in New
 
01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Law related to reduction or
 
01:02:28.910 --> 01:02:28.920 align:start position:0%
harm reduction rather and this is a
 
01:02:31.549 --> 01:02:31.559 align:start position:0%
poorly defined term that got fixed a
 
01:02:34.549 --> 01:02:34.559 align:start position:0%
little bit in HHS before it went to the
 
01:02:38.030 --> 01:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
house but talking to some folks who
 
01:02:40.549 --> 01:02:40.559 align:start position:0%
participated in that process they're
 
01:02:42.230 --> 01:02:42.240 align:start position:0%
still not comfortable that we've got the
 
01:02:45.049 --> 01:02:45.059 align:start position:0%
harm reduction right and and just as a
 
01:02:47.630 --> 01:02:47.640 align:start position:0%
kind of a personal story I I I think
 
01:02:51.530 --> 01:02:51.540 align:start position:0%
we're about 10 to 15 years behind Europe
 
01:02:55.250 --> 01:02:55.260 align:start position:0%
on the harm reduction efforts
 
01:02:57.230 --> 01:02:57.240 align:start position:0%
um I you know I used to travel to
 
01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
Amsterdam a lot and they decided to
 
01:03:03.890 --> 01:03:03.900 align:start position:0%
follow a harm reduction program and the
 
01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
town of Amsterdam and key tourists areas
 
01:03:13.069 --> 01:03:13.079 align:start position:0%
just became profligate with open-air use
 
01:03:15.710 --> 01:03:15.720 align:start position:0%
of of drugs and narcotics even though
 
01:03:17.870 --> 01:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
they were trying to go a harm reduction
 
01:03:20.990 --> 01:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
route so I just want to make sure that
 
01:03:24.109 --> 01:03:24.119 align:start position:0%
this subgroup really makes sure that the
 
01:03:26.630 --> 01:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
definition and boundaries on what harm
 
01:03:30.349 --> 01:03:30.359 align:start position:0%
reduction truly means is defined because
 
01:03:34.569 --> 01:03:34.579 align:start position:0%
in San Francisco it includes
 
01:03:38.510 --> 01:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
safe injection sites where people can go
 
01:03:41.650 --> 01:03:41.660 align:start position:0%
and get illicit drugs injected into them
 
01:03:45.170 --> 01:03:45.180 align:start position:0%
and I don't think that's consistent with
 
01:03:47.569 --> 01:03:47.579 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire culture so but we'll look
 
01:03:49.789 --> 01:03:49.799 align:start position:0%
at that and then the third thing it does
 
01:03:54.170 --> 01:03:54.180 align:start position:0%
is it imposes a minimal uh requirement
 
01:03:58.130 --> 01:03:58.140 align:start position:0%
on new training for all licenses related
 
01:04:00.470 --> 01:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
to controlled prescription health and
 
01:04:03.049 --> 01:04:03.059 align:start position:0%
safety programs I'd like to see that in
 
01:04:06.230 --> 01:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
context you know what how much training
 
01:04:08.329 --> 01:04:08.339 align:start position:0%
are they already being mandated to take
 
01:04:10.730 --> 01:04:10.740 align:start position:0%
and and what is the impact of requiring
 
01:04:12.770 --> 01:04:12.780 align:start position:0%
three more hours and is three the right
 
01:04:14.510 --> 01:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
number should it be one or two or
 
01:04:16.789 --> 01:04:16.799 align:start position:0%
something else so so I think there's
 
01:04:19.250 --> 01:04:19.260 align:start position:0%
some real work this is like I said this
 
01:04:22.490 --> 01:04:22.500 align:start position:0%
is all friendly you know the idea of
 
01:04:26.329 --> 01:04:26.339 align:start position:0%
having less harm done in our society is
 
01:04:28.250 --> 01:04:28.260 align:start position:0%
a good one I think we can all subscribe
 
01:04:31.130 --> 01:04:31.140 align:start position:0%
to but I really would recommend that we
 
01:04:34.490 --> 01:04:34.500 align:start position:0%
look before we leap and I know this is
 
01:04:38.750 --> 01:04:38.760 align:start position:0%
going to be a tight vote but I would ask
 
01:04:44.510 --> 01:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:46.190 --> 01:04:46.200 align:start position:0%
thank you further discussion
 
01:04:47.809 --> 01:04:47.819 align:start position:0%
representative Leon
 
01:04:49.490 --> 01:04:49.500 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:04:51.289 --> 01:04:51.299 align:start position:0%
for that great breakdown of some of the
 
01:04:52.970 --> 01:04:52.980 align:start position:0%
challenges with the current structure of
 
01:04:54.109 --> 01:04:54.119 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:04:56.089 --> 01:04:56.099 align:start position:0%
um in Health and Human Services we did
 
01:04:57.650 --> 01:04:57.660 align:start position:0%
do a lot of work in order to try and
 
01:04:59.470 --> 01:04:59.480 align:start position:0%
refine the definition of harm reduction
 
01:05:01.910 --> 01:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
and it's absolutely critical to make
 
01:05:03.829 --> 01:05:03.839 align:start position:0%
sure that we get that right there was
 
01:05:05.750 --> 01:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
some great work done to make sure that
 
01:05:08.030 --> 01:05:08.040 align:start position:0%
people at end of life or with chronic
 
01:05:10.910 --> 01:05:10.920 align:start position:0%
pain were not wrapped up in some of the
 
01:05:13.250 --> 01:05:13.260 align:start position:0%
drug use mitigation efforts because for
 
01:05:15.289 --> 01:05:15.299 align:start position:0%
some people opiates are the correct
 
01:05:18.049 --> 01:05:18.059 align:start position:0%
choice and truly the reducing harm is by
 
01:05:19.430 --> 01:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
making sure that they have appropriate
 
01:05:22.130 --> 01:05:22.140 align:start position:0%
access just as we worked through it
 
01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
there were a lot of challenges that
 
01:05:25.549 --> 01:05:25.559 align:start position:0%
conceptually Health and Human Services
 
01:05:27.349 --> 01:05:27.359 align:start position:0%
knew that this was a good idea to start
 
01:05:30.349 --> 01:05:30.359 align:start position:0%
working towards but financially we need
 
01:05:31.730 --> 01:05:31.740 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we understand the
 
01:05:34.010 --> 01:05:34.020 align:start position:0%
consequences because harm reduction has
 
01:05:35.630 --> 01:05:35.640 align:start position:0%
been drawn very very broadly in other
 
01:05:39.049 --> 01:05:39.059 align:start position:0%
states we did a good first effort in
 
01:05:41.390 --> 01:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
defining it here but before we open up
 
01:05:43.130 --> 01:05:43.140 align:start position:0%
more funding and more State funding we
 
01:05:44.390 --> 01:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
need to make sure that our other harm
 
01:05:47.030 --> 01:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
reduction efforts that we sent over such
 
01:05:49.309 --> 01:05:49.319 align:start position:0%
as the the drug checking to make sure
 
01:05:50.569 --> 01:05:50.579 align:start position:0%
that people who are using Straight
 
01:05:52.730 --> 01:05:52.740 align:start position:0%
Street drugs can make sure that the
 
01:05:54.470 --> 01:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
Cannabis they purchase isn't laced with
 
01:05:56.329 --> 01:05:56.339 align:start position:0%
fentanyl where a woman in my district
 
01:05:58.670 --> 01:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
has now lost her son that we make sure
 
01:06:00.710 --> 01:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
our entire harm reduction efforts come
 
01:06:02.329 --> 01:06:02.339 align:start position:0%
together to make sure that not only
 
01:06:04.549 --> 01:06:04.559 align:start position:0%
state-funded harm reduction but those
 
01:06:06.589 --> 01:06:06.599 align:start position:0%
are people taking initiative are
 
01:06:08.510 --> 01:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
embraced is absolutely critical because
 
01:06:10.670 --> 01:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
harm reduction isn't just one approach
 
01:06:12.470 --> 01:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
this is why we're working so hard on the
 
01:06:14.510 --> 01:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
definition and we need to enable people
 
01:06:16.130 --> 01:06:16.140 align:start position:0%
all throughout the state to reduce harm
 
01:06:18.589 --> 01:06:18.599 align:start position:0%
so thank you I'd support a retained
 
01:06:18.599 --> 01:06:20.390 align:start position:0%
so thank you I'd support a retained
motion

01:06:20.390 --> 01:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
motion
 
01:06:23.510 --> 01:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham uh thank you Mr
 
01:06:26.510 --> 01:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
chairman SB 239 was a highly supported
 
01:06:30.170 --> 01:06:30.180 align:start position:0%
bill by in the house after a lengthy
 
01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
floor discussion led by Dr Nagel the
 
01:06:35.870 --> 01:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
bill passed overwhelmingly
 
01:06:38.750 --> 01:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
there are no Financial Appropriations in
 
01:06:41.930 --> 01:06:41.940 align:start position:0%
this bill therefore any reasons for
 
01:06:44.329 --> 01:06:44.339 align:start position:0%
retaining the bill related to policy not
 
01:06:46.910 --> 01:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
financing at this point the floor debate
 
01:06:49.430 --> 01:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
was very persuasive the vote of the
 
01:06:52.970 --> 01:06:52.980 align:start position:0%
house clear and no Financial impact I'm
 
01:06:54.710 --> 01:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
going to vote against the motion to
 
01:06:57.589 --> 01:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
retain and I urge you all to join me
 
01:07:00.289 --> 01:07:00.299 align:start position:0%
uh and but thank you for the opportunity
 
01:07:01.910 --> 01:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
to speak
 
01:07:04.309 --> 01:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
 
01:07:06.589 --> 01:07:06.599 align:start position:0%
tolerski thank you Mr chairman I just
 
01:07:09.049 --> 01:07:09.059 align:start position:0%
wanted to make one clarification at the
 
01:07:11.210 --> 01:07:11.220 align:start position:0%
hearing with the senator who's the Prime
 
01:07:13.789 --> 01:07:13.799 align:start position:0%
sponsor he was asked directly would this
 
01:07:16.250 --> 01:07:16.260 align:start position:0%
bill fund safe infections injection
 
01:07:18.470 --> 01:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
sites and the answer was no absolutely
 
01:07:20.809 --> 01:07:20.819 align:start position:0%
not this bill does not support safe
 
01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:22.799 align:start position:0%
injection sites it is not in the bill is
 
01:07:24.230 --> 01:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
allowable so I just wanted to clarify
 
01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
that I will be joining my colleague
 
01:07:27.829 --> 01:07:27.839 align:start position:0%
voting against this I believe this bill
 
01:07:29.630 --> 01:07:29.640 align:start position:0%
will actually save lives and I think
 
01:07:31.250 --> 01:07:31.260 align:start position:0%
it's unfortunate that it potentially
 
01:07:35.329 --> 01:07:35.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:38.089 --> 01:07:38.099 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
01:07:39.529 --> 01:07:39.539 align:start position:0%
seeing none are you ready for the
 
01:07:41.630 --> 01:07:41.640 align:start position:0%
question the clerk will call a role on
 
01:07:43.609 --> 01:07:43.619 align:start position:0%

like to speak to that motion
second

01:09:22.249 --> 01:09:22.259 align:start position:0%
second
 
01:09:25.849 --> 01:09:25.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:25.859 --> 01:09:29.110 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:09:29.110 --> 01:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:09:34.729 --> 01:09:34.739 align:start position:0%
um so as a member of the commission that
 
01:09:37.010 --> 01:09:37.020 align:start position:0%
looked at the granite state Advantage
 
01:09:37.020 --> 01:09:37.930 align:start position:0%
looked at the granite state Advantage
Program

01:09:37.930 --> 01:09:37.940 align:start position:0%
Program
 
01:09:41.450 --> 01:09:41.460 align:start position:0%
in uh I'm already in record on that
 
01:09:45.470 --> 01:09:45.480 align:start position:0%
report as approving the
 
01:09:47.570 --> 01:09:47.580 align:start position:0%
um the granite Advantage Health Care
 
01:09:52.070 --> 01:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
Program and its extension uh I I would I
 
01:09:55.669 --> 01:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
would just like to point out that we
 
01:09:59.689 --> 01:09:59.699 align:start position:0%
that report did not specify a length of
 
01:10:02.450 --> 01:10:02.460 align:start position:0%
time at which the for which the program
 
01:10:06.650 --> 01:10:06.660 align:start position:0%
should be repealed or extended so it was
 
01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
silent on that and so there has been
 
01:10:11.810 --> 01:10:11.820 align:start position:0%
some a lot of discussion on it the
 
01:10:14.689 --> 01:10:14.699 align:start position:0%
initial house position was two the
 
01:10:16.669 --> 01:10:16.679 align:start position:0%
initial Senate position was forever
 
01:10:19.790 --> 01:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
current bill before us essentially says
 
01:10:24.890 --> 01:10:24.900 align:start position:0%
forever we we put this item into hb2 so
 
01:10:27.050 --> 01:10:27.060 align:start position:0%
that it could be a better discussion
 
01:10:30.550 --> 01:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
just it's uh it's my understanding
 
01:10:35.090 --> 01:10:35.100 align:start position:0%
that there's a rapidly developing
 
01:10:39.410 --> 01:10:39.420 align:start position:0%
consensus around a sunset of six or
 
01:10:42.350 --> 01:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
seven years I'll I I won't I won't put
 
01:10:44.930 --> 01:10:44.940 align:start position:0%
my thumb on that too much but
 
01:10:48.350 --> 01:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
um the uh so there is no doubt we want
 
01:10:50.030 --> 01:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
to take this to another five-year
 
01:10:52.910 --> 01:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
contract and that's how we get to six or
 
01:10:55.370 --> 01:10:55.380 align:start position:0%
seven if you if you recognize that we
 
01:10:57.770 --> 01:10:57.780 align:start position:0%
need one year to get to the new contract
 
01:11:00.290 --> 01:11:00.300 align:start position:0%
and that every contract in Medicaid
 
01:11:03.649 --> 01:11:03.659 align:start position:0%
wants to be a five-year contract that's
 
01:11:06.669 --> 01:11:06.679 align:start position:0%
six so the argument for the seventh year
 
01:11:10.850 --> 01:11:10.860 align:start position:0%
is is I think a rational one where it
 
01:11:13.490 --> 01:11:13.500 align:start position:0%
would be good to be able to add the
 
01:11:16.130 --> 01:11:16.140 align:start position:0%
option and the contract of extending it
 
01:11:19.669 --> 01:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
for one more year just in case we have
 
01:11:19.679 --> 01:11:21.250 align:start position:0%
for one more year just in case we have
some

01:11:21.250 --> 01:11:21.260 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:11:23.810 --> 01:11:23.820 align:start position:0%
turbulence towards the end of the
 
01:11:25.910 --> 01:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
contract where the legislature needs to
 
01:11:28.430 --> 01:11:28.440 align:start position:0%
be more clear so so so why bother with
 
01:11:30.590 --> 01:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
the sunset you all have heard this
 
01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:32.149 align:start position:0%
the sunset you all have heard this
before

01:11:32.149 --> 01:11:32.159 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:11:35.030 --> 01:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
um uh we we know that the legislation
 
01:11:37.370 --> 01:11:37.380 align:start position:0%
that's already in fact in effect says
 
01:11:39.770 --> 01:11:39.780 align:start position:0%
that if the federal government backs off
 
01:11:42.709 --> 01:11:42.719 align:start position:0%
of its current ninety percent uh match
 
01:11:45.590 --> 01:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
level that that gives us the potential
 
01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:46.850 align:start position:0%
level that that gives us the potential
to

01:11:46.850 --> 01:11:46.860 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:11:50.330 --> 01:11:50.340 align:start position:0%
get out of the program but the current
 
01:11:52.790 --> 01:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
law does not talk about changes in
 
01:11:56.750 --> 01:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
eligibility so uh it it so if the
 
01:11:58.729 --> 01:11:58.739 align:start position:0%
federal government who I don't think we
 
01:12:00.830 --> 01:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
have any business trusting to keep their
 
01:12:05.330 --> 01:12:05.340 align:start position:0%
promises uh changes something I think
 
01:12:08.870 --> 01:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
it's an incumbent upon us today and and
 
01:12:12.290 --> 01:12:12.300 align:start position:0%
with this legislature to give us a
 
01:12:15.709 --> 01:12:15.719 align:start position:0%
future legislature a graceful way out if
 
01:12:18.530 --> 01:12:18.540 align:start position:0%
this is a good program if the feds uh
 
01:12:20.209 --> 01:12:20.219 align:start position:0%
you know surprise us and keep their
 
01:12:23.450 --> 01:12:23.460 align:start position:0%
promises then I suspect this program
 
01:12:27.770 --> 01:12:27.780 align:start position:0%
will be easily extended and if not it
 
01:12:32.330 --> 01:12:32.340 align:start position:0%
can be easily uh exited so so the motion
 
01:12:36.229 --> 01:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
is basically let's retain 263 and let
 
01:12:40.250 --> 01:12:40.260 align:start position:0%
the hb2 item be worked out between the
 
01:12:41.510 --> 01:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
president of the Senate and the speaker
 
01:12:45.410 --> 01:12:45.420 align:start position:0%
of the house if I were to bet I would
 
01:12:48.229 --> 01:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
bet that they would agree on either six
 
01:12:50.930 --> 01:12:50.940 align:start position:0%
or seven years which ought to give us
 
01:12:53.270 --> 01:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
all confidence that we're going to be
 
01:12:54.950 --> 01:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
taking care of the health care needs of
 
01:12:58.010 --> 01:12:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:59.990 --> 01:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
 
01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.550 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
Stringham

01:13:01.550 --> 01:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
Stringham
 
01:13:05.209 --> 01:13:05.219 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman as SB 263 passed
 
01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
in the house by a wide margin and
 
01:13:10.430 --> 01:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
unanimously in the Senate 24-0
 
01:13:12.110 --> 01:13:12.120 align:start position:0%
it provides for permanently
 
01:13:14.450 --> 01:13:14.460 align:start position:0%
reauthorization of the widely supported
 
01:13:18.169 --> 01:13:18.179 align:start position:0%
Granite Advantage Program which sunsets
 
01:13:22.450 --> 01:13:22.460 align:start position:0%
December 31st 2023 by current law
 
01:13:26.630 --> 01:13:26.640 align:start position:0%
retaining the bill won't help us if we
 
01:13:28.550 --> 01:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
bring it back here after January 1st
 
01:13:31.010 --> 01:13:31.020 align:start position:0%
when the program is expired
 
01:13:34.550 --> 01:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
the retention of the bill is principally
 
01:13:37.990 --> 01:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
in favor of the budget house B2
 
01:13:40.850 --> 01:13:40.860 align:start position:0%
program extension which currently is two
 
01:13:43.790 --> 01:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
years in our view the non-arbitrary
 
01:13:46.610 --> 01:13:46.620 align:start position:0%
calendar triggers in the existing bill
 
01:13:49.250 --> 01:13:49.260 align:start position:0%
that Safeguard future budgets are
 
01:13:49.260 --> 01:13:50.209 align:start position:0%
that Safeguard future budgets are
adequate

01:13:50.209 --> 01:13:50.219 align:start position:0%
adequate
 
01:13:52.910 --> 01:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
and adding another calendar
 
01:13:56.209 --> 01:13:56.219 align:start position:0%
trigger is not necessary and in fact
 
01:13:59.630 --> 01:13:59.640 align:start position:0%
could be harmful to the program itself
 
01:14:02.630 --> 01:14:02.640 align:start position:0%
and create inefficiencies during any
 
01:14:05.330 --> 01:14:05.340 align:start position:0%
reauthorization or recontracting that
 
01:14:07.490 --> 01:14:07.500 align:start position:0%
may come up we'll have plenty of
 
01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
opportunities to challenge the program
 
01:14:12.649 --> 01:14:12.659 align:start position:0%
modify the program if the federal
 
01:14:15.530 --> 01:14:15.540 align:start position:0%
government changes his mind without a
 
01:14:17.169 --> 01:14:17.179 align:start position:0%
calendar trigger
 
01:14:17.179 --> 01:14:19.010 align:start position:0%
calendar trigger
therefore

01:14:19.010 --> 01:14:19.020 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
01:14:21.770 --> 01:14:21.780 align:start position:0%
um I think we should continue uh to make
 
01:14:24.410 --> 01:14:24.420 align:start position:0%
our our intent known of keeping this
 
01:14:26.870 --> 01:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
program in place which is serving our
 
01:14:29.209 --> 01:14:29.219 align:start position:0%
constituents so well there's nothing
 
01:14:34.250 --> 01:14:34.260 align:start position:0%
graceful about a time trigger two years
 
01:14:36.290 --> 01:14:36.300 align:start position:0%
from now six years from now or seven
 
01:14:39.050 --> 01:14:39.060 align:start position:0%
years from now for so for these Reasons
 
01:14:41.450 --> 01:14:41.460 align:start position:0%
I'm going to vote against this motion to
 
01:14:43.250 --> 01:14:43.260 align:start position:0%
retain so a better motion could be
 
01:14:45.590 --> 01:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
brought forward
 
01:14:48.110 --> 01:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
01:14:51.470 --> 01:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:53.870 --> 01:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman in all the
 
01:14:56.810 --> 01:14:56.820 align:start position:0%
discussion on this bill that we had on
 
01:14:59.410 --> 01:14:59.420 align:start position:0%
the house floor and and here today
 
01:15:02.810 --> 01:15:02.820 align:start position:0%
it's been talked about as as a great you
 
01:15:05.090 --> 01:15:05.100 align:start position:0%
know program and and strong and so on
 
01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:06.649 align:start position:0%
know program and and strong and so on
and

01:15:06.649 --> 01:15:06.659 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:15:10.189 --> 01:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
um but there is a downside to this
 
01:15:13.090 --> 01:15:13.100 align:start position:0%
um and I'd like to at least mention it
 
01:15:16.669 --> 01:15:16.679 align:start position:0%
this program has very poor incentives
 
01:15:19.550 --> 01:15:19.560 align:start position:0%
the structure of it is all wrong from my
 
01:15:20.689 --> 01:15:20.699 align:start position:0%
point of view
 
01:15:24.050 --> 01:15:24.060 align:start position:0%
I'm a part owner of a restaurant
 
01:15:26.570 --> 01:15:26.580 align:start position:0%
and our experience in the restaurant was
 
01:15:29.330 --> 01:15:29.340 align:start position:0%
that in the old days when we wanted
 
01:15:33.470 --> 01:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
people to work extra hours they were
 
01:15:36.110 --> 01:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
very willing to do so right they wanted
 
01:15:38.750 --> 01:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
to earn more money and so on
 
01:15:42.169 --> 01:15:42.179 align:start position:0%
but today even though we have roughly
 
01:15:45.110 --> 01:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
the same number of employees that we had
 
01:15:47.689 --> 01:15:47.699 align:start position:0%
prior to the pandemic
 
01:15:50.630 --> 01:15:50.640 align:start position:0%
we they are working many many fewer
 
01:15:55.010 --> 01:15:55.020 align:start position:0%
hours because they're well aware that
 
01:15:58.669 --> 01:15:58.679 align:start position:0%
that programs like this have a cliff and
 
01:16:02.270 --> 01:16:02.280 align:start position:0%
if they work too much they they lose
 
01:16:04.669 --> 01:16:04.679 align:start position:0%
their eligibility for this kind of a
 
01:16:07.189 --> 01:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
program and so therefore when we ask
 
01:16:10.490 --> 01:16:10.500 align:start position:0%
people please can you work you know an
 
01:16:12.950 --> 01:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
extra evening or an extra whatever they
 
01:16:16.610 --> 01:16:16.620 align:start position:0%
say no I can't because all of a sudden I
 
01:16:19.070 --> 01:16:19.080 align:start position:0%
would lose this particular benefit and
 
01:16:22.430 --> 01:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
so there this program you know is well
 
01:16:25.070 --> 01:16:25.080 align:start position:0%
intentioned but I think it needs if
 
01:16:28.010 --> 01:16:28.020 align:start position:0%
possible to be restructured in such a
 
01:16:30.530 --> 01:16:30.540 align:start position:0%
way that there's not a cliff but a but a
 
01:16:30.540 --> 01:16:32.209 align:start position:0%
way that there's not a cliff but a but a
ramp

01:16:32.209 --> 01:16:32.219 align:start position:0%
ramp
 
01:16:35.149 --> 01:16:35.159 align:start position:0%
um so that so that
 
01:16:38.450 --> 01:16:38.460 align:start position:0%
um people it doesn't disincentivize work
 
01:16:41.450 --> 01:16:41.460 align:start position:0%
we are no longer able to we used to be
 
01:16:44.750 --> 01:16:44.760 align:start position:0%
open for lunch and dinner every day now
 
01:16:47.090 --> 01:16:47.100 align:start position:0%
we are only open for lunch a few days a
 
01:16:50.630 --> 01:16:50.640 align:start position:0%
week because we simply can't get enough
 
01:16:53.270 --> 01:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
people to work it's that simple thank
 
01:16:56.390 --> 01:16:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:57.950 --> 01:16:57.960 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
 
01:17:00.709 --> 01:17:00.719 align:start position:0%
Edwards uh uh thank you Mr chair and and
 
01:17:02.810 --> 01:17:02.820 align:start position:0%
thank you for for your remarks and your
 
01:17:06.229 --> 01:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
observation uh I I didn't mention in my
 
01:17:08.270 --> 01:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
intro but
 
01:17:13.070 --> 01:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
um uh I I sort of feel accountable as
 
01:17:16.370 --> 01:17:16.380 align:start position:0%
maybe all of us should that while the
 
01:17:18.890 --> 01:17:18.900 align:start position:0%
granite state Advantage program has been
 
01:17:22.910 --> 01:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
in place there hasn't been an effort to
 
01:17:25.850 --> 01:17:25.860 align:start position:0%
go and work through the details of what
 
01:17:29.450 --> 01:17:29.460 align:start position:0%
an alternative ought to look like and um
 
01:17:33.010 --> 01:17:33.020 align:start position:0%
and so this was a a major
 
01:17:35.570 --> 01:17:35.580 align:start position:0%
observation on my part of a little Dam
 
01:17:37.610 --> 01:17:37.620 align:start position:0%
how come we haven't been working on
 
01:17:40.729 --> 01:17:40.739 align:start position:0%
something that's better than this and um
 
01:17:43.850 --> 01:17:43.860 align:start position:0%
and we just didn't so so my commitment
 
01:17:47.149 --> 01:17:47.159 align:start position:0%
to you would be if I'm still around in
 
01:17:49.010 --> 01:17:49.020 align:start position:0%
eight years that you can feel the
 
01:17:52.130 --> 01:17:52.140 align:start position:0%
shutter run through the room but if I'm
 
01:17:55.610 --> 01:17:55.620 align:start position:0%
that I I will have tried to get the
 
01:17:57.410 --> 01:17:57.420 align:start position:0%
smart people like you and others
 
01:18:00.649 --> 01:18:00.659 align:start position:0%
together to figure out what the future
 
01:18:03.229 --> 01:18:03.239 align:start position:0%
might look like so that when this bill
 
01:18:05.270 --> 01:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
is coming towards termination maybe
 
01:18:08.510 --> 01:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
before then that we show up with
 
01:18:11.149 --> 01:18:11.159 align:start position:0%
something and and my sort of attitude is
 
01:18:12.910 --> 01:18:12.920 align:start position:0%
you can't beat something with nothing
 
01:18:15.410 --> 01:18:15.420 align:start position:0%
and this is something and we don't have
 
01:18:17.990 --> 01:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
anything so so I I think there's some
 
01:18:20.570 --> 01:18:20.580 align:start position:0%
work to be done and I hope hopefully we
 
01:18:22.610 --> 01:18:22.620 align:start position:0%
can talk about that
 
01:18:22.620 --> 01:18:25.570 align:start position:0%
can talk about that
foreign

01:18:25.570 --> 01:18:25.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:28.550 --> 01:18:28.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman looking back to
 
01:18:29.990 --> 01:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
our last session
 
01:18:32.450 --> 01:18:32.460 align:start position:0%
um there had been a very good
 
01:18:34.430 --> 01:18:34.440 align:start position:0%
effort in order to try and discuss some
 
01:18:36.890 --> 01:18:36.900 align:start position:0%
of the challenges around the program and
 
01:18:38.870 --> 01:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
why it's important to have a sunset but
 
01:18:40.610 --> 01:18:40.620 align:start position:0%
unfortunately a lot of those discussions
 
01:18:43.850 --> 01:18:43.860 align:start position:0%
were not permitted this program provides
 
01:18:45.850 --> 01:18:45.860 align:start position:0%
a very valuable benefit for people
 
01:18:49.430 --> 01:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
however if we were to move to a
 
01:18:51.950 --> 01:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
permanent extension with no Sunset that
 
01:18:53.330 --> 01:18:53.340 align:start position:0%
would continue to shift the whole
 
01:18:55.070 --> 01:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
landscape in this country around Health
 
01:18:57.350 --> 01:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
Care as it stands there are a few States
 
01:18:59.090 --> 01:18:59.100 align:start position:0%
who have not adopted expanded medicaid
 
01:19:00.950 --> 01:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
at all and when you look to the National
 
01:19:03.470 --> 01:19:03.480 align:start position:0%
level I'm with National Council Of State
 
01:19:05.030 --> 01:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
legislatures on some of the health care
 
01:19:08.030 --> 01:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
policy teams and when there's a shift
 
01:19:09.410 --> 01:19:09.420 align:start position:0%
and if all of the states are on board
 
01:19:10.970 --> 01:19:10.980 align:start position:0%
there will be more shifts in the
 
01:19:13.669 --> 01:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion World in DC because
 
01:19:15.649 --> 01:19:15.659 align:start position:0%
we're moving to a much more controlled
 
01:19:17.990 --> 01:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
Health Care system and when those
 
01:19:20.030 --> 01:19:20.040 align:start position:0%
holdouts move to Medicaid expansion
 
01:19:21.290 --> 01:19:21.300 align:start position:0%
they're going to be more ships in the
 
01:19:23.810 --> 01:19:23.820 align:start position:0%
Health Care system as more and more
 
01:19:27.050 --> 01:19:27.060 align:start position:0%
States ex have permanent Medicaid
 
01:19:29.030 --> 01:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
expansion that further shifts the
 
01:19:31.250 --> 01:19:31.260 align:start position:0%
discussion on a national level by having
 
01:19:33.410 --> 01:19:33.420 align:start position:0%
reauthorization pair periodically here
 
01:19:35.270 --> 01:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we have a better check
 
01:19:37.189 --> 01:19:37.199 align:start position:0%
on what happens in Washington DC
 
01:19:39.709 --> 01:19:39.719 align:start position:0%
regardless of who is in power there one
 
01:19:41.330 --> 01:19:41.340 align:start position:0%
party or the other there's always going
 
01:19:43.010 --> 01:19:43.020 align:start position:0%
to be changes that may not be a benefit
 
01:19:44.930 --> 01:19:44.940 align:start position:0%
to the people of New Hampshire so
 
01:19:46.910 --> 01:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
needing to reauthorize it is absolutely
 
01:19:49.010 --> 01:19:49.020 align:start position:0%
critical that's one of those areas that
 
01:19:50.870 --> 01:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
helps to keep our cost under containment
 
01:19:54.470 --> 01:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
by having these discussions and I think
 
01:19:55.850 --> 01:19:55.860 align:start position:0%
that it's very important that we retain
 
01:19:57.410 --> 01:19:57.420 align:start position:0%
it this is this language is in the
 
01:20:00.169 --> 01:20:00.179 align:start position:0%
budget I fully support the efforts that
 
01:20:01.970 --> 01:20:01.980 align:start position:0%
are moving forward on the budget and I I
 
01:20:03.050 --> 01:20:03.060 align:start position:0%
believe we will come to a good
 
01:20:04.430 --> 01:20:04.440 align:start position:0%
compromise for the people of New
 
01:20:06.530 --> 01:20:06.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and this program will continue
 
01:20:08.990 --> 01:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
I think that a vote to retain this is a
 
01:20:10.790 --> 01:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
vote of confidence in US passing a
 
01:20:14.030 --> 01:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
budget in the house because assuming we
 
01:20:16.310 --> 01:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
pass a budget this is unnecessary
 
01:20:17.810 --> 01:20:17.820 align:start position:0%
because it's already going to be
 
01:20:19.490 --> 01:20:19.500 align:start position:0%
continued for the people of New
 
01:20:20.990 --> 01:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I quite honestly think
 
01:20:22.669 --> 01:20:22.679 align:start position:0%
that saying that this bill needs to
 
01:20:24.590 --> 01:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
continue so that we don't meet the the
 
01:20:26.689 --> 01:20:26.699 align:start position:0%
cliff is a vote of no confidence in the
 
01:20:28.189 --> 01:20:28.199 align:start position:0%
budget and I I was really hoping we
 
01:20:30.290 --> 01:20:30.300 align:start position:0%
could continue this bipartisan effort to
 
01:20:32.149 --> 01:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
work for the people of New Hampshire and
 
01:20:34.130 --> 01:20:34.140 align:start position:0%
bring the solutions that they're asking
 
01:20:37.430 --> 01:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
for forward so I'll be voting to retain
 
01:20:40.850 --> 01:20:40.860 align:start position:0%
thank you further discussion
 
01:20:40.860 --> 01:20:45.830 align:start position:0%
thank you further discussion
representative

01:20:45.830 --> 01:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:49.490 --> 01:20:49.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman Miller
 
01:20:51.649 --> 01:20:51.659 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to very quickly uh
 
01:20:53.990 --> 01:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
comment on an earlier statement made by
 
01:20:55.430 --> 01:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
distinguished colleague that said that
 
01:20:57.530 --> 01:20:57.540 align:start position:0%
the bill had broad support it was
 
01:20:59.090 --> 01:20:59.100 align:start position:0%
broadly supported
 
01:21:02.149 --> 01:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
I didn't want to just let my
 
01:21:04.310 --> 01:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
recollection and I checked the results
 
01:21:05.990 --> 01:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:21:08.990 --> 01:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
OTP motion had 189 votes from the
 
01:21:11.090 --> 01:21:11.100 align:start position:0%
Democrats four from the Republicans out
 
01:21:12.770 --> 01:21:12.780 align:start position:0%
the 400 people
 
01:21:15.770 --> 01:21:15.780 align:start position:0%
I think it's important when we use broad
 
01:21:19.130 --> 01:21:19.140 align:start position:0%
support to maybe at least wait until it
 
01:21:22.070 --> 01:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
gets over 200 out of 400 before we call
 
01:21:26.030 --> 01:21:26.040 align:start position:0%
it that so it was a narrow vote and the
 
01:21:27.649 --> 01:21:27.659 align:start position:0%
house had every right to vote that way
 
01:21:29.689 --> 01:21:29.699 align:start position:0%
and I see the results but I don't
 
01:21:31.610 --> 01:21:31.620 align:start position:0%
consider that a broad mandate from the
 
01:21:33.649 --> 01:21:33.659 align:start position:0%
house thank you
 
01:21:35.630 --> 01:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
for the discussion on the motion to
 
01:21:38.630 --> 01:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
retain Senate Bill 263 FM representative
 
01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:40.430 align:start position:0%
retain Senate Bill 263 FM representative
Hewitt

01:21:40.430 --> 01:21:40.440 align:start position:0%
Hewitt
 
01:21:43.430 --> 01:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I'm also going to vote in
 
01:21:45.430 --> 01:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
opposition to
 
01:21:49.370 --> 01:21:49.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:52.310 --> 01:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
talking about when the people when it
 
01:21:56.330 --> 01:21:56.340 align:start position:0%
will work harder if they if you put a
 
01:21:58.490 --> 01:21:58.500 align:start position:0%
work requirement in
 
01:22:01.370 --> 01:22:01.380 align:start position:0%
the reason I think that in most cases at
 
01:22:03.709 --> 01:22:03.719 align:start position:0%
least today when it comes to Health Care
 
01:22:05.390 --> 01:22:05.400 align:start position:0%
that the reason that people are
 
01:22:07.729 --> 01:22:07.739 align:start position:0%
unwilling to work a lot of extra hours
 
01:22:10.910 --> 01:22:10.920 align:start position:0%
is that the remuneration for working the
 
01:22:14.090 --> 01:22:14.100 align:start position:0%
extra hours isn't sufficient to make up
 
01:22:16.310 --> 01:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
the difference between what they're
 
01:22:18.470 --> 01:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
going to get in benefits if they get
 
01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:19.490 align:start position:0%
going to get in benefits if they get
sick

01:22:19.490 --> 01:22:19.500 align:start position:0%
sick
 
01:22:22.790 --> 01:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
that as they would get if they're well
 
01:22:25.550 --> 01:22:25.560 align:start position:0%
and that's a really concern for people
 
01:22:27.350 --> 01:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
particularly because people with small
 
01:22:30.950 --> 01:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
children and people with small children
 
01:22:33.229 --> 01:22:33.239 align:start position:0%
are people who are frequently involved
 
01:22:37.850 --> 01:22:37.860 align:start position:0%
in the business of a work requirement
 
01:22:37.860 --> 01:22:39.470 align:start position:0%
in the business of a work requirement
um

01:22:39.470 --> 01:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:41.090 align:start position:0%
um
the

01:22:41.090 --> 01:22:41.100 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:22:45.770 --> 01:22:45.780 align:start position:0%
the other thing that concerns me is that
 
01:22:47.810 --> 01:22:47.820 align:start position:0%
we're putting we're putting a time limit
 
01:22:50.270 --> 01:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
on it the time limit right now the
 
01:22:54.590 --> 01:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
deadline is December 31st this year
 
01:22:55.970 --> 01:22:55.980 align:start position:0%
ain't talking about how many years out
 
01:22:59.030 --> 01:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
it is or not uh the the statute that's
 
01:23:00.470 --> 01:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
in effect now
 
01:23:04.189 --> 01:23:04.199 align:start position:0%
expires on December 31st and whatever
 
01:23:06.530 --> 01:23:06.540 align:start position:0%
position you take on any other aspect of
 
01:23:10.070 --> 01:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
the bill uh legally that's a really
 
01:23:13.250 --> 01:23:13.260 align:start position:0%
important deadline to consider because
 
01:23:15.169 --> 01:23:15.179 align:start position:0%
you don't you don't have the you don't
 
01:23:17.990 --> 01:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
have the luxury of retaining and just
 
01:23:20.030 --> 01:23:20.040 align:start position:0%
retaining and doing going from one thing
 
01:23:22.430 --> 01:23:22.440 align:start position:0%
to the other in order to change things
 
01:23:22.440 --> 01:23:23.709 align:start position:0%
to the other in order to change things
without

01:23:23.709 --> 01:23:23.719 align:start position:0%
without
 
01:23:26.330 --> 01:23:26.340 align:start position:0%
bearing that firmly in mind
 
01:23:26.340 --> 01:23:28.669 align:start position:0%
bearing that firmly in mind
and

01:23:28.669 --> 01:23:28.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:23:28.679 --> 01:23:30.770 align:start position:0%
and
furthermore

01:23:30.770 --> 01:23:30.780 align:start position:0%
furthermore
 
01:23:35.470 --> 01:23:35.480 align:start position:0%
um if you if you put a drop dead
 
01:23:38.330 --> 01:23:38.340 align:start position:0%
provision then such as the the one
 
01:23:40.310 --> 01:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
that's being proposed uh in connection
 
01:23:44.209 --> 01:23:44.219 align:start position:0%
with the with the the
 
01:23:46.010 --> 01:23:46.020 align:start position:0%
discussion of the Republicans have been
 
01:23:48.110 --> 01:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
having had
 
01:23:50.689 --> 01:23:50.699 align:start position:0%
it's simply another way of saying well
 
01:23:52.070 --> 01:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
we're gonna we're gonna end this thing
 
01:23:54.590 --> 01:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
without having to do anything
 
01:23:56.990 --> 01:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
uh you don't have to you don't have to
 
01:23:59.090 --> 01:23:59.100 align:start position:0%
find that there's anything wrong with it
 
01:24:02.570 --> 01:24:02.580 align:start position:0%
in order to uh in order to stop it if
 
01:24:04.130 --> 01:24:04.140 align:start position:0%
you have a deadline
 
01:24:06.950 --> 01:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh as far as I can see there isn't any
 
01:24:10.070 --> 01:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
big push right at the moment for saying
 
01:24:13.970 --> 01:24:13.980 align:start position:0%
that the Medicare Medicaid Advantage is
 
01:24:17.330 --> 01:24:17.340 align:start position:0%
a bad thing in fact uh the experience
 
01:24:19.490 --> 01:24:19.500 align:start position:0%
around the country is kind of quite the
 
01:24:22.970 --> 01:24:22.980 align:start position:0%
opposite so I'm I'm going to uh I'm
 
01:24:24.310 --> 01:24:24.320 align:start position:0%
going to vote
 
01:24:29.149 --> 01:24:29.159 align:start position:0%
in in my conscience to make sure that
 
01:24:30.709 --> 01:24:30.719 align:start position:0%
this this
 
01:24:34.070 --> 01:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
um the the Medicaid expansion continues
 
01:24:36.590 --> 01:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
and is available to people but so long
 
01:24:39.950 --> 01:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
as it does a job that does not does not
 
01:24:47.390 --> 01:24:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:49.370 --> 01:24:49.380 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman and I think the
 
01:24:51.050 --> 01:24:51.060 align:start position:0%
previous representative speaking for his
 
01:24:52.910 --> 01:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
remarks um I think that there's a lot of
 
01:24:55.010 --> 01:24:55.020 align:start position:0%
confusion about what Medicaid expansion
 
01:24:57.050 --> 01:24:57.060 align:start position:0%
actually is if you are somebody with
 
01:24:58.430 --> 01:24:58.440 align:start position:0%
young children you are not actually
 
01:25:00.770 --> 01:25:00.780 align:start position:0%
eligible for Medicaid expansion because
 
01:25:03.649 --> 01:25:03.659 align:start position:0%
you are on traditional Medicaid when we
 
01:25:05.330 --> 01:25:05.340 align:start position:0%
had received different feedback we would
 
01:25:07.490 --> 01:25:07.500 align:start position:0%
received feedback from people in the in
 
01:25:09.709 --> 01:25:09.719 align:start position:0%
the disability Community however people
 
01:25:11.810 --> 01:25:11.820 align:start position:0%
on disability are on traditional
 
01:25:14.689 --> 01:25:14.699 align:start position:0%
Medicaid not Medicaid expansion this is
 
01:25:16.310 --> 01:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
yet one more example about how
 
01:25:18.950 --> 01:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
misunderstood this program is and how it
 
01:25:22.250 --> 01:25:22.260 align:start position:0%
requires the the ongoing review of the
 
01:25:23.870 --> 01:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
legislature to make sure that we
 
01:25:25.250 --> 01:25:25.260 align:start position:0%
continue to do things right for the
 
01:25:27.050 --> 01:25:27.060 align:start position:0%
people of the state because we do things
 
01:25:31.430 --> 01:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:33.530 --> 01:25:33.540 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the motion to
 
01:25:39.590 --> 01:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:41.689 --> 01:25:41.699 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham I thank my
