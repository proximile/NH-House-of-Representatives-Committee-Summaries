thank you everyone
 
00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:05.159 align:start position:0%
um before I get into the the first bill
 
00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 align:start position:0%
and the first set of hearings I just
 
00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 align:start position:0%
wanted to thank all the committee
 
00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
members for getting their reports in
 
00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 align:start position:0%
last night I've sent them on to
 
00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 align:start position:0%
Christina Dyer and Lindsay ostrike I
 
00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
believe is oh the name is pronounced so
 
00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 align:start position:0%
again thank you all very much
 
00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
the first bill to um consider this
 
00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 align:start position:0%
morning is House Bill 406 and it's
 
00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 align:start position:0%
sponsored by representative kovalt who's
 
00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 align:start position:0%
a member of our committee
 
00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:41.870 align:start position:0%
a member of our committee
foreign

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 align:start position:0%
um this bill I think is uh
 
00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 align:start position:0%
quite straightforward in its language
 
00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 align:start position:0%
um it asserts that a parent or Guardian
 
00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 align:start position:0%
has the right to access their minor
 
00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
unemancipated child's medical records
 
00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
with some exceptions and those
 
00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
exceptions are wherever there is a
 
00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 align:start position:0%
specific provision in State Statute or
 
00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 align:start position:0%
state law or federal law
 
00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:14.699 align:start position:0%
that allows for those records to be uh
 
00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:17.699 align:start position:0%
to be to be kept confidential
 
00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 align:start position:0%
or where there is suspected abuse
 
00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:24.419 align:start position:0%
or in cases where the parent has agreed
 
00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:27.479 align:start position:0%
in writing to waive the right to access
 
00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 align:start position:0%
those records
 
00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 align:start position:0%
so you may ask why this is necessary
 
00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
it's because in state law we don't have
 
00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 align:start position:0%
anything that's specifically asserts a
 
00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 align:start position:0%
parent's right to access medical records
 
00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
and in fact some health care providers
 
00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:44.039 align:start position:0%
have issued letters to
 
00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:44.689 align:start position:0%
have issued letters to
um

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:44.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:47.639 align:start position:0%
to parents I have one in front of me
 
00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 align:start position:0%
here which outlines all of the uh all of
 
00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:53.639 align:start position:0%
the categories of medical records that a
 
00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:56.039 align:start position:0%
parent would not have access to because
 
00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
their child turned 12. and so from the
 
00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:01.160 align:start position:0%
age of 12 to 18
 
00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:04.139 align:start position:0%
there were certain records that these
 
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:05.880 align:start position:0%
there are certain records that Health
 
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
Care Providers are choosing to withhold
 
00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:09.900 align:start position:0%
from parents
 
00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.890 align:start position:0%
from parents
so

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:12.900 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:15.900 align:start position:0%
and that includes for example lab test
 
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
results in under State Statute there are
 
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:21.900 align:start position:0%
some lab test results and even the fact
 
00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.029 align:start position:0%
some lab test results and even the fact
that

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:23.039 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
a lab test was ordered could be withheld
 
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:28.860 align:start position:0%
and I'll talk about some of those
 
00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:32.100 align:start position:0%
examples now so HIV testing for example
 
00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:35.000 align:start position:0%
is confidential
 
00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:38.340 align:start position:0%
likewise sexually transmitted diseases
 
00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:40.620 align:start position:0%
we we would not want
 
00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:43.620 align:start position:0%
a 17 year old who suspects that may they
 
00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:46.919 align:start position:0%
may have a sexually transmitted disease
 
00:06:49.249 --> 00:06:49.259 align:start position:0%
to not seek care and not seek treatment
 
00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:51.780 align:start position:0%
so there are specific
 
00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:54.060 align:start position:0%
um there are specific carve-outs like
 
00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.809 align:start position:0%
um there are specific carve-outs like
those

00:06:56.809 --> 00:06:56.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:00.600 align:start position:0%
the the bill is actually worded that any
 
00:07:04.249 --> 00:07:04.259 align:start position:0%
treatment that would require the parents
 
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
consent also affords the parent the
 
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:09.240 align:start position:0%
right to those medical records so there
 
00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:10.380 align:start position:0%
are some other things that don't require
 
00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:13.199 align:start position:0%
parental consent for example a minor age
 
00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:17.060 align:start position:0%
12 or older May consent to treatment for
 
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
drug dependency so if they have
 
00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
substance abuse problems 12 or older can
 
00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:26.580 align:start position:0%
consent to treatment without the consent
 
00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
of a parent or Guardian
 
00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
um so these and a number of other
 
00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:33.960 align:start position:0%
categories are covered under both
 
00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:36.360 align:start position:0%
federal and state law so they would not
 
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
be subject to the disclosure uh to to
 
00:07:41.089 --> 00:07:41.099 align:start position:0%
the uh to the mandatory disclosure
 
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:43.740 align:start position:0%
parents under under this bill
 
00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:45.900 align:start position:0%
um mandatory disclosure is probably not
 
00:07:47.629 --> 00:07:47.639 align:start position:0%
an accurate way of describing it it's
 
00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:49.380 align:start position:0%
not that they are required to
 
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
proactively disclose it is um it is that
 
00:07:54.469 --> 00:07:54.479 align:start position:0%
parents have a right to access it upon
 
00:07:54.479 --> 00:07:56.330 align:start position:0%
parents have a right to access it upon
request

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:56.340 align:start position:0%
request
 
00:07:59.570 --> 00:07:59.580 align:start position:0%
um so everything else essentially any
 
00:08:01.129 --> 00:08:01.139 align:start position:0%
medical records relating to any
 
00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
treatment that requires consent that is
 
00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:04.340 align:start position:0%
not otherwise
 
00:08:07.189 --> 00:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
carved out in state or federal law would
 
00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:09.180 align:start position:0%
be made available to parents if this
 
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
bill were to become law
 
00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:14.280 align:start position:0%
um and I just want to
 
00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:14.950 align:start position:0%
um and I just want to
um

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
mention that the Constitutional law
 
00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:22.520 align:start position:0%
asserts that parents
 
00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:24.900 align:start position:0%
there is a there's a presumption that
 
00:08:26.869 --> 00:08:26.879 align:start position:0%
parents have the best interest of their
 
00:08:29.629 --> 00:08:29.639 align:start position:0%
children in mind and this was affirmed
 
00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:31.860 align:start position:0%
in Parham versus Jr and this was a
 
00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court case
 
00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:37.260 align:start position:0%
in which a Georgia couple wanted to
 
00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:40.740 align:start position:0%
commit their minor child to a mental
 
00:08:44.269 --> 00:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
facility and the court determined that
 
00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
this was in fact in the bet that the the
 
00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:48.180 align:start position:0%
parents were acting in the best interest
 
00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:50.540 align:start position:0%
of the child and that you know they they
 
00:08:53.389 --> 00:08:53.399 align:start position:0%
allowed for some sort of follow-up
 
00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:56.220 align:start position:0%
process to affirm that that process was
 
00:08:59.389 --> 00:08:59.399 align:start position:0%
being done in good faith but that there
 
00:09:00.949 --> 00:09:00.959 align:start position:0%
was not a need to have a preemptive
 
00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:02.940 align:start position:0%
court order to make it happen so the
 
00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
presumption there in the to quote from
 
00:09:06.889 --> 00:09:06.899 align:start position:0%
Parham versus Jr the court stated that
 
00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
the natural bonds of affection lead
 
00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:10.620 align:start position:0%
parents to act in the best interest of
 
00:09:12.769 --> 00:09:12.779 align:start position:0%
their children so this is established in
 
00:09:14.449 --> 00:09:14.459 align:start position:0%
constitutional law it's affirmed by the
 
00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:16.860 align:start position:0%
U.S Supreme Court and it is the basis
 
00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
upon which this bill is founded
 
00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:22.380 align:start position:0%
and with that I will and my testimony
 
00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:25.620 align:start position:0%
and take questions okay great thank you
 
00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:32.220 align:start position:0%
looking at uh thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:09:33.949 --> 00:09:33.959 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Koval for
 
00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:36.240 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:09:38.449 --> 00:09:38.459 align:start position:0%
um I'm looking at lines eight and nine
 
00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
and I I see the words reasonable
 
00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
reasonably believes
 
00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:46.980 align:start position:0%
is it not true that uh if they
 
00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:50.580 align:start position:0%
reasonably believe that there's uh that
 
00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:53.220 align:start position:0%
there's domestic violence abuse or
 
00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:54.720 align:start position:0%
neglect that they would actually have to
 
00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:56.820 align:start position:0%
report that
 
00:10:00.769 --> 00:10:00.779 align:start position:0%
that is that is correct yes thank you
 
00:10:02.389 --> 00:10:02.399 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:10:05.329 --> 00:10:05.339 align:start position:0%
yes representative Weber
 
00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:07.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you very
 
00:10:09.769 --> 00:10:09.779 align:start position:0%
much for taking my question
 
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:12.240 align:start position:0%
um I'm wondering if you could provide
 
00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
the committee members with a list both
 
00:10:19.269 --> 00:10:19.279 align:start position:0%
of uh the things that you were informed
 
00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
that the doctor would not supply
 
00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:27.720 align:start position:0%
and also with a list of things that as
 
00:10:30.769 --> 00:10:30.779 align:start position:0%
this bill is drafted would be supplied
 
00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
that would be really very helpful in
 
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
terms of because I know there's a fairly
 
00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:37.620 align:start position:0%
large Global Universe out there yes and
 
00:10:40.009 --> 00:10:40.019 align:start position:0%
I'll be happy to email the committee
 
00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
copies of of a letter from Elliott
 
00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
Health to uh to parents this this does
 
00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:46.740 align:start position:0%
not have any names on it so it doesn't
 
00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
need to be redacted
 
00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:51.240 align:start position:0%
um and it is a bit dated it is dated
 
00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.970 align:start position:0%
um and it is a bit dated it is dated
2012.

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:52.980 align:start position:0%
2012.
 
00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
um so they may have different policies
 
00:10:58.090 --> 00:10:58.100 align:start position:0%
in place at this time nevertheless
 
00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:00.300 align:start position:0%
there's still nothing in State Statute
 
00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:01.860 align:start position:0%
that prevents them them or other
 
00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:03.839 align:start position:0%
providers from taking this position so
 
00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:06.660 align:start position:0%
I'll just list a couple of things
 
00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:07.730 align:start position:0%
I'll just list a couple of things
um

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:07.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:09.889 --> 00:11:09.899 align:start position:0%
parents do not have the the right acts
 
00:11:12.829 --> 00:11:12.839 align:start position:0%
the access under this letter from
 
00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:15.320 align:start position:0%
Elliott Health to view lab test results
 
00:11:18.769 --> 00:11:18.779 align:start position:0%
uh to track ongoing health concerns to
 
00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:22.500 align:start position:0%
view past office visits or to view
 
00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:24.540 align:start position:0%
future appointments to cancel
 
00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
appointments or to refill
 
00:11:29.949 --> 00:11:29.959 align:start position:0%
prescriptions so
 
00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
that specific list has to do with
 
00:11:38.329 --> 00:11:38.339 align:start position:0%
online access but it is accompanying a
 
00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:41.100 align:start position:0%
letter that essentially says you know
 
00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
you're you know there there will be
 
00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:45.660 align:start position:0%
automatic changes for patients turning
 
00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:46.790 align:start position:0%
automatic changes for patients turning
12

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
12
 
00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:48.660 align:start position:0%
years old
 
00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:50.640 align:start position:0%
um and that that certain
 
00:11:53.509 --> 00:11:53.519 align:start position:0%
access to certain records will be
 
00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:55.980 align:start position:0%
um will be limited for parents from that
 
00:11:57.769 --> 00:11:57.779 align:start position:0%
point forward so I'll be happy to email
 
00:11:59.870 --> 00:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
that to the committee
 
00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:01.740 align:start position:0%
representative McLean
 
00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:03.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:12:05.569 --> 00:12:05.579 align:start position:0%
taking my question so I'm a little bit
 
00:12:05.579 --> 00:12:06.710 align:start position:0%
taking my question so I'm a little bit
confused

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:06.720 align:start position:0%
confused
 
00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
um and maybe you can help me so if if
 
00:12:11.449 --> 00:12:11.459 align:start position:0%
there is no if there's currently no
 
00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:13.500 align:start position:0%
right to access
 
00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:16.500 align:start position:0%
records for the parent once a child gets
 
00:12:18.769 --> 00:12:18.779 align:start position:0%
over the age of 12 you mentioned that
 
00:12:20.269 --> 00:12:20.279 align:start position:0%
there are all these carve outs that
 
00:12:20.279 --> 00:12:21.170 align:start position:0%
there are all these carve outs that
exist

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:21.180 align:start position:0%
exist
 
00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:25.260 align:start position:0%
why do those carvarks exist and if there
 
00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:28.500 align:start position:0%
is no right you know what I'm saying so
 
00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't have to create an exception
 
00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:32.690 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't have to create an exception
to

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:32.700 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
um not to prevent access if the law
 
00:12:36.829 --> 00:12:36.839 align:start position:0%
currently does not allow access at all
 
00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:42.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:45.660 align:start position:0%
um it does make sense I I think that
 
00:12:47.329 --> 00:12:47.339 align:start position:0%
that when
 
00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:49.260 align:start position:0%
when certain
 
00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:52.260 align:start position:0%
legislation was passed for example the
 
00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
RSA 141c 18 and I will provide a copy of
 
00:12:58.250 --> 00:12:58.260 align:start position:0%
my testimony to to members of the
 
00:13:01.269 --> 00:13:01.279 align:start position:0%
committee but 141c 18
 
00:13:05.389 --> 00:13:05.399 align:start position:0%
is is specifically about a minor child
 
00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:09.240 align:start position:0%
14 years of adult or 14 years of age or
 
00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:12.240 align:start position:0%
older May voluntarily submit himself
 
00:13:14.509 --> 00:13:14.519 align:start position:0%
or herself to medical diagnosis and
 
00:13:16.069 --> 00:13:16.079 align:start position:0%
treatment for a sexually transmitted
 
00:13:16.079 --> 00:13:17.150 align:start position:0%
treatment for a sexually transmitted
disease

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
disease
 
00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
and a licensed physician May diagnose
 
00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:21.420 align:start position:0%
treat or prescribe for the treatment of
 
00:13:23.509 --> 00:13:23.519 align:start position:0%
a sexually transmitted disease in a
 
00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
minor 14 years of age or older without
 
00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:27.180 align:start position:0%
the knowledge or consent of the parent
 
00:13:29.389 --> 00:13:29.399 align:start position:0%
or legal guardian of such minor so I
 
00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
believe that that language was added in
 
00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
order to just affirmatively assert that
 
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
in this case
 
00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:37.970 align:start position:0%
in this case
um

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:37.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
if if another bill like the one we're
 
00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:43.740 align:start position:0%
hearing today were to come along that
 
00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:47.100 align:start position:0%
the the legislators who who filed that
 
00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:49.380 align:start position:0%
legislation wanted to affirmatively
 
00:13:51.769 --> 00:13:51.779 align:start position:0%
assert that this is a situation in which
 
00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:53.660 align:start position:0%
we would want to maintain Conte
 
00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
confidentiality and that there is a
 
00:13:58.910 --> 00:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
compelling State interest in doing so
 
00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.410 align:start position:0%
compelling State interest in doing so
yeah

00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:00.420 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:02.519 align:start position:0%
um did you want to follow yeah just a
 
00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:06.180 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up so the the the items
 
00:14:08.090 --> 00:14:08.100 align:start position:0%
mentioned in your testimony earlier
 
00:14:11.269 --> 00:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
about the Elliot are those currently
 
00:14:11.279 --> 00:14:11.870 align:start position:0%
about the Elliot are those currently
um

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
are they
 
00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:15.380 align:start position:0%
are there
 
00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:17.700 align:start position:0%
restrictions on those things currently
 
00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:19.800 align:start position:0%
in statute or is that just kind of that
 
00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:21.060 align:start position:0%
umbrella language that you were talking
 
00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:22.430 align:start position:0%
umbrella language that you were talking
about

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:14:25.069 --> 00:14:25.079 align:start position:0%
um there's nothing in State Statute that
 
00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
says the parents affirmatively have a
 
00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:28.040 align:start position:0%
right to this information
 
00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
under HIPAA the apparent acting in local
 
00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
you know basic or parent or person
 
00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
acting acting in local parentis has the
 
00:14:42.769 --> 00:14:42.779 align:start position:0%
um has the right to give consent
 
00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:46.980 align:start position:0%
on behalf of a minor and has the right
 
00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:49.620 align:start position:0%
to the miners Health Care records and
 
00:14:52.069 --> 00:14:52.079 align:start position:0%
again in federal statute there are also
 
00:14:54.769 --> 00:14:54.779 align:start position:0%
some carve-outs so this bill essentially
 
00:14:57.410 --> 00:14:57.420 align:start position:0%
says those carve outs remain intact so
 
00:14:59.930 --> 00:14:59.940 align:start position:0%
again in sexually transmitted diseases
 
00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
are also covered in federal law Family
 
00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:05.160 align:start position:0%
Planning is covered in federal law so
 
00:15:08.689 --> 00:15:08.699 align:start position:0%
there are it's it's actually a fairly
 
00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
confusing mix of uh of laws and I know
 
00:15:15.949 --> 00:15:15.959 align:start position:0%
that the the memo that we got uh just a
 
00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:18.540 align:start position:0%
few minutes ago includes a document that
 
00:15:21.949 --> 00:15:21.959 align:start position:0%
I think is actually quite useful
 
00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:25.740 align:start position:0%
um and it contains a table
 
00:15:27.769 --> 00:15:27.779 align:start position:0%
um so so it's sort of a long document
 
00:15:32.449 --> 00:15:32.459 align:start position:0%
but if you go to the table which is
 
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
well those pages are numbered
 
00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
um and if it's it's page 10 uh table one
 
00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:45.660 align:start position:0%
and then page 11 table 2 is is a useful
 
00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:48.260 align:start position:0%
reference that can outline
 
00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:52.620 align:start position:0%
which which procedures a a miner would
 
00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:54.240 align:start position:0%
need to consent to
 
00:15:56.629 --> 00:15:56.639 align:start position:0%
and what the specific confidentiality
 
00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
laws are with respect to those I did
 
00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:03.240 align:start position:0%
speak to an attorney about
 
00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
um sort of mental health and had a
 
00:16:08.389 --> 00:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
little bit of a disagreement between
 
00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
this document and the attorney with whom
 
00:16:13.189 --> 00:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
I spoke regarding mental health
 
00:16:14.889 --> 00:16:14.899 align:start position:0%
um and I'm trying to find it right now
 
00:16:17.569 --> 00:16:17.579 align:start position:0%
there is a case Berg versus Berg which
 
00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:19.320 align:start position:0%
was a New Hampshire Supreme Court case
 
00:16:23.829 --> 00:16:23.839 align:start position:0%
in which the the court determined that
 
00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:27.660 align:start position:0%
a minor child May assert their rights of
 
00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:30.180 align:start position:0%
sort of privileged communication with a
 
00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:32.820 align:start position:0%
mental health provider
 
00:16:35.449 --> 00:16:35.459 align:start position:0%
um under certain at least under certain
 
00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:37.560 align:start position:0%
circumstances and the circumstances of
 
00:16:38.749 --> 00:16:38.759 align:start position:0%
that case were that the parents were
 
00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
getting divorced they were at battle
 
00:16:43.189 --> 00:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
with each other the the father wanted
 
00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:45.660 align:start position:0%
access to the mental health records the
 
00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:47.150 align:start position:0%
access to the mental health records the
the

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
counselor's notes
 
00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:51.839 align:start position:0%
um to determine whether there were
 
00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
parental alienation efforts going on by
 
00:16:57.949 --> 00:16:57.959 align:start position:0%
the wife in this case the judge
 
00:16:59.269 --> 00:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
determined that it was not in the best
 
00:17:00.949 --> 00:17:00.959 align:start position:0%
that that was not done in good faith in
 
00:17:02.749 --> 00:17:02.759 align:start position:0%
the best interest of the child and
 
00:17:04.549 --> 00:17:04.559 align:start position:0%
therefore asserted that the the father
 
00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:07.020 align:start position:0%
did not have a right to access those
 
00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:09.240 align:start position:0%
records under those situations so the
 
00:17:10.909 --> 00:17:10.919 align:start position:0%
difference I think is
 
00:17:13.309 --> 00:17:13.319 align:start position:0%
where some of the some of the opinions
 
00:17:15.409 --> 00:17:15.419 align:start position:0%
that I have seen assert that that was
 
00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
sort of a broad
 
00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
a broad decision some other uh some
 
00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
other records or some other opinions
 
00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:25.260 align:start position:0%
that I have seen assert that it no it
 
00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:27.480 align:start position:0%
was actually quite narrowly defined
 
00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:29.340 align:start position:0%
um around that best interest of the
 
00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:32.100 align:start position:0%
child standard
 
00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
representative Palmer and then
 
00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:35.580 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
00:17:37.549 --> 00:17:37.559 align:start position:0%
so I'm glad I'm not a pediatrician
 
00:17:37.559 --> 00:17:39.590 align:start position:0%
so I'm glad I'm not a pediatrician
because

00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:43.140 align:start position:0%
um so I guess my concern
 
00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
would be um some of the Lesser issues I
 
00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:50.280 align:start position:0%
know when my kids got to that age after
 
00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
the first part of a you know well child
 
00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:54.360 align:start position:0%
check we would be ushered out of the
 
00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
room and the pediatrician was talking to
 
00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:01.320 align:start position:0%
them about risky behaviors so it wasn't
 
00:18:03.049 --> 00:18:03.059 align:start position:0%
as didn't reach the level of treatment
 
00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
for an STD as far as I know but it was
 
00:18:09.789 --> 00:18:09.799 align:start position:0%
more about tobacco drugs alcohol
 
00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
sex all of those things that they would
 
00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:16.140 align:start position:0%
not want to maybe talk about in front of
 
00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:19.260 align:start position:0%
their parents but as a parent I would
 
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
like my pediatrician to talk to my kids
 
00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:23.150 align:start position:0%
like my pediatrician to talk to my kids
about

00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:23.160 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:25.260 align:start position:0%
um and I just want to make sure that
 
00:18:28.549 --> 00:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
that doesn't get quashed
 
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
I mean I guess I'd like you to comment
 
00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
yeah so so I think that's a very very
 
00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:35.160 align:start position:0%
valid concern
 
00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:37.740 align:start position:0%
um I think all of us when we're at that
 
00:18:39.409 --> 00:18:39.419 align:start position:0%
stage in our lives probably had things
 
00:18:40.789 --> 00:18:40.799 align:start position:0%
that we didn't want to talk to our
 
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
parents about but there were other
 
00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
trusted adults that we wanted to have
 
00:18:45.529 --> 00:18:45.539 align:start position:0%
those conversations with
 
00:18:47.029 --> 00:18:47.039 align:start position:0%
um I actually think there's a simple
 
00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:50.220 align:start position:0%
answer to this and and that lies in the
 
00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
bill itself
 
00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:52.909 align:start position:0%
bill itself
um

00:18:52.909 --> 00:18:52.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:55.260 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral three one of the
 
00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
exceptions in which a parent's parent
 
00:18:59.570 --> 00:18:59.580 align:start position:0%
would not have access to medical records
 
00:19:01.549 --> 00:19:01.559 align:start position:0%
would be if the parent or legal guardian
 
00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:03.480 align:start position:0%
agrees to a confidential communication
 
00:19:05.029 --> 00:19:05.039 align:start position:0%
between the minor and a health care
 
00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:07.380 align:start position:0%
provider so I think again this puts the
 
00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
power in the hands of the parent to make
 
00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
that decision I think that the parent
 
00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:13.500 align:start position:0%
again is presumed to be acting in the
 
00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:16.020 align:start position:0%
best interest of the child and
 
00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:17.029 align:start position:0%
best interest of the child and
um

00:19:17.029 --> 00:19:17.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:19.320 align:start position:0%
you know I I ultimately believe that
 
00:19:21.169 --> 00:19:21.179 align:start position:0%
parents should be in control of of
 
00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:22.980 align:start position:0%
whether those conversations happen who
 
00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:24.360 align:start position:0%
has those conversations with their
 
00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:25.669 align:start position:0%
has those conversations with their
children

00:19:25.669 --> 00:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:28.380 align:start position:0%
um and and has some awareness that
 
00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:29.820 align:start position:0%
they're happening
 
00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
um even if
 
00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:33.480 align:start position:0%
you know they they choose to
 
00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
allow that you know someone else may be
 
00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:37.740 align:start position:0%
the better person to have some of those
 
00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
confidential conversations
 
00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
representative Weber and then
 
00:19:43.909 --> 00:19:43.919 align:start position:0%
representative Seth King
 
00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:46.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I just wanted to
 
00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:49.260 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that between the time uh the
 
00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
last question was asked and the time I
 
00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:53.820 align:start position:0%
put my hand up I I had discovered the
 
00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:55.860 align:start position:0%
excellent research that Ms Dyer has
 
00:19:57.650 --> 00:19:57.660 align:start position:0%
provided us with and I just wanted to
 
00:19:59.750 --> 00:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
say thank you and that
 
00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:01.620 align:start position:0%
um relieves you of some of the questions
 
00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:04.620 align:start position:0%
that I asked earlier but I would still
 
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
love to see the the Elliott letter if
 
00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:07.980 align:start position:0%
you're willing to share it happy to do
 
00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:09.480 align:start position:0%
that thank you so much
 
00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
Christina how we always does a great job
 
00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:14.100 align:start position:0%
representative King thank you chairman
 
00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:17.460 align:start position:0%
McDonald thank you for taking questions
 
00:20:19.789 --> 00:20:19.799 align:start position:0%
so you mentioned that
 
00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:22.740 align:start position:0%
um there are times where the doctors are
 
00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:25.260 align:start position:0%
refusing to give the information to the
 
00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
parents and it and it doesn't fit into
 
00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:29.460 align:start position:0%
one of these three categories
 
00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
can you can you give me any examples not
 
00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:33.720 align:start position:0%
just of doctors not giving information
 
00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
but where maybe it was later found out
 
00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
that there was some very inappropriate
 
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
behavior or abuse or
 
00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:44.940 align:start position:0%
something happening from the medical
 
00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:47.220 align:start position:0%
profession towards the children because
 
00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
I think that's really at the heart of it
 
00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
what we're really concerned about is hey
 
00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:53.400 align:start position:0%
the doctors aren't doing what's in the
 
00:20:56.029 --> 00:20:56.039 align:start position:0%
best interest of the children but do we
 
00:20:58.789 --> 00:20:58.799 align:start position:0%
have any any real documentation that
 
00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
that's the case thank you
 
00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
um I'm gonna I'm gonna actually say
 
00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
that's that's not my concern I mean my
 
00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
concern is that parents be informed and
 
00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
have have a full right to access medical
 
00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:15.660 align:start position:0%
records I think uh generally speaking
 
00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:17.930 align:start position:0%
records I think uh generally speaking
um

00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:17.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:19.909 --> 00:21:19.919 align:start position:0%
I I think that
 
00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:22.260 align:start position:0%
you know Physicians get into in
 
00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
healthcare providers in general get into
 
00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
the field that they get into because
 
00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
they they want to get into a caring
 
00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:29.510 align:start position:0%
they they want to get into a caring
profession

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
profession
 
00:21:32.029 --> 00:21:32.039 align:start position:0%
um my concern is that
 
00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:35.100 align:start position:0%
in order for parents to do their job
 
00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:37.380 align:start position:0%
effectively they need to be fully
 
00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
informed and it concerns me greatly when
 
00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:42.360 align:start position:0%
I see a form letter with a kind of
 
00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:43.980 align:start position:0%
blanket statement there's all this
 
00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
information that you're not going to
 
00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
have access to and
 
00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:48.409 align:start position:0%
have access to and
um

00:21:48.409 --> 00:21:48.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:50.700 align:start position:0%
you know I just generally think that we
 
00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
need to remedy that and a lot of this I
 
00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
think ultimately is about trust because
 
00:21:57.230 --> 00:21:57.240 align:start position:0%
when I when I
 
00:21:59.750 --> 00:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
um when I think about parents rights
 
00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:01.980 align:start position:0%
issues and this to me is a parental
 
00:22:03.289 --> 00:22:03.299 align:start position:0%
rights issue
 
00:22:05.029 --> 00:22:05.039 align:start position:0%
um I think that you know it's about
 
00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:08.220 align:start position:0%
establishing a a framework for trust and
 
00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:10.980 align:start position:0%
a foundation for that and I I think that
 
00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:13.860 align:start position:0%
this does that creating a foundation for
 
00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:16.740 align:start position:0%
trust does not automatically imply that
 
00:22:19.549 --> 00:22:19.559 align:start position:0%
there's distrust it it simply says that
 
00:22:21.169 --> 00:22:21.179 align:start position:0%
you know we need to we need full
 
00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
communication and fully informed parents
 
00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:31.860 align:start position:0%
yes representative Merchant
 
00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:35.220 align:start position:0%
representative couple taking the
 
00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:36.110 align:start position:0%
representative couple taking the
question

00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
does this preclude a court I'm not an
 
00:22:40.789 --> 00:22:40.799 align:start position:0%
attorney so I'm looking at two here on
 
00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:45.240 align:start position:0%
is does this preclude a court order from
 
00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:46.620 align:start position:0%
releasing the information if the court
 
00:22:50.149 --> 00:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:50.159 --> 00:22:52.070 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:53.900 align:start position:0%
I would have to consult with an attorney
 
00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:56.700 align:start position:0%
my intention would be that yes a court
 
00:22:59.630 --> 00:22:59.640 align:start position:0%
could could order records sealed because
 
00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:02.940 align:start position:0%
we currently have processes around some
 
00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
of the carve outs that are or some of
 
00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
the things that are in uh in in the law
 
00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:10.430 align:start position:0%
the things that are in uh in in the law
today

00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:10.440 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
um you know for example you know we
 
00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
require parental notification for
 
00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:17.750 align:start position:0%
require parental notification for
abortion

00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
abortion
 
00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:18.409 align:start position:0%
abortion
um

00:23:18.409 --> 00:23:18.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:20.940 align:start position:0%
as I understand it there is there is a
 
00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
process that a minor can go through if
 
00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:28.500 align:start position:0%
if there are abuse issues or other
 
00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:32.100 align:start position:0%
concerns that would lead a court to
 
00:23:35.289 --> 00:23:35.299 align:start position:0%
to allow that process to be to be
 
00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:38.100 align:start position:0%
accepted so
 
00:23:41.029 --> 00:23:41.039 align:start position:0%
um so so my my intention and my
 
00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
understanding is that yes a court could
 
00:23:45.529 --> 00:23:45.539 align:start position:0%
could order otherwise as they did in the
 
00:23:48.289 --> 00:23:48.299 align:start position:0%
Berg versus Berg case
 
00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:50.100 align:start position:0%
which was a New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:53.100 align:start position:0%
case a follow-up follow-up do we need to
 
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
include something in the bill to be
 
00:23:57.289 --> 00:23:57.299 align:start position:0%
clear that that is in fact the case
 
00:23:59.630 --> 00:23:59.640 align:start position:0%
I would be happy to work with members of
 
00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:01.380 align:start position:0%
the committee if you decide you would
 
00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:03.320 align:start position:0%
like to do that yes
 
00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:05.460 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman
 
00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:07.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:10.190 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:10.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:13.140 align:start position:0%
I'm just thinking as a parent
 
00:24:15.409 --> 00:24:15.419 align:start position:0%
uh and I and I have heard complaints
 
00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
from other parents too about this very
 
00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:19.430 align:start position:0%
from other parents too about this very
problem

00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
um do you see this kind of practice
 
00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
where there's a blanket policy for not
 
00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:26.930 align:start position:0%
where there's a blanket policy for not
releasing

00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:26.940 align:start position:0%
releasing
 
00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
um you know the Exempted medical records
 
00:24:33.289 --> 00:24:33.299 align:start position:0%
to the parents would deter parents or
 
00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:35.220 align:start position:0%
make them you know think they don't want
 
00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
to bring their child to the doctor for
 
00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:40.130 align:start position:0%
to bring their child to the doctor for
care

00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:40.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:41.510 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
it's interesting that you should ask
 
00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:46.620 align:start position:0%
that so I I have spoken to parents who
 
00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:47.590 align:start position:0%
that so I I have spoken to parents who
are

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:24:49.909 --> 00:24:49.919 align:start position:0%
reluctant I think there was a comment
 
00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:51.900 align:start position:0%
earlier about
 
00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:54.360 align:start position:0%
um you know the the parent is asked to
 
00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
leave the room I have certainly spoken
 
00:24:58.490 --> 00:24:58.500 align:start position:0%
to parents who say I'm not comfortable
 
00:25:00.649 --> 00:25:00.659 align:start position:0%
with that and I don't like that and I
 
00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
again I believe that the parent acting
 
00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:04.740 align:start position:0%
in the best interest of their child has
 
00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:06.780 align:start position:0%
has every right to assert that an
 
00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:09.380 align:start position:0%
exception would be in the case of
 
00:25:12.649 --> 00:25:12.659 align:start position:0%
suspected abuse and you know there there
 
00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:16.020 align:start position:0%
is a scenario included in the bill in
 
00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
which if there is suspected abuse then
 
00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:20.700 align:start position:0%
medical records may be withheld I'm not
 
00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
sure how a physician would handle that
 
00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:23.820 align:start position:0%
scenario where they're asking the parent
 
00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
to leave the room and they suspect abuse
 
00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:28.500 align:start position:0%
but it seems to me that as mandatory
 
00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
reporters at that point it's time to
 
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
call in
 
00:25:34.490 --> 00:25:34.500 align:start position:0%
um the you know dcyf or or someone who
 
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
can who can look into the situation
 
00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
okay other questions yes representative
 
00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:43.919 align:start position:0%
Nagle thank you Mr chairman thanks for
 
00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:45.380 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:47.460 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to figure out how to turn
 
00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:49.020 align:start position:0%
this into a question but it's an
 
00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:50.580 align:start position:0%
important issue
 
00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:53.460 align:start position:0%
um I think this bill is very helpful for
 
00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:54.890 align:start position:0%
um I think this bill is very helpful for
um

00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:54.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:57.049 --> 00:25:57.059 align:start position:0%
removing some of the confusion that we
 
00:25:59.930 --> 00:25:59.940 align:start position:0%
as doctors have so we treat adolescents
 
00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
like they're quasi adults
 
00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:05.940 align:start position:0%
um what we're taught in this age group
 
00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
is that we should give them some freedom
 
00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:10.380 align:start position:0%
to express themselves without the parent
 
00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:13.380 align:start position:0%
present I think that what you've seen
 
00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
from Elliot Hospital is turning that
 
00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:17.820 align:start position:0%
into a very different issue that the kid
 
00:26:19.789 --> 00:26:19.799 align:start position:0%
has the right to do this without the
 
00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:22.260 align:start position:0%
parents being involved
 
00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
um that's why I'm struggling to turn
 
00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:25.140 align:start position:0%
this into a question but I think this is
 
00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:27.720 align:start position:0%
really important to teach doctors that
 
00:26:30.529 --> 00:26:30.539 align:start position:0%
that yeah this is important to develop
 
00:26:33.409 --> 00:26:33.419 align:start position:0%
Independence but
 
00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
we need to have some sort of standard
 
00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:38.520 align:start position:0%
I'm still struggling to make this a
 
00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:41.580 align:start position:0%
question yeah
 
00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:43.010 align:start position:0%
question yeah
yeah

00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:43.020 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:26:45.289 --> 00:26:45.299 align:start position:0%
I'm really
 
00:26:47.570 --> 00:26:47.580 align:start position:0%
is that would you believe I am
 
00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:51.500 align:start position:0%
struggling with the issue that yeah
 
00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:54.120 align:start position:0%
would you believe I'm trying to find the
 
00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:57.240 align:start position:0%
words for yeah you're right you're
 
00:26:58.610 --> 00:26:58.620 align:start position:0%
definitely not ready for a parliamentary
 
00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:01.500 align:start position:0%
no definitely not not but I have three
 
00:27:03.289 --> 00:27:03.299 align:start position:0%
minutes I was told earlier this morning
 
00:27:03.299 --> 00:27:04.730 align:start position:0%
minutes I was told earlier this morning
so

00:27:04.730 --> 00:27:04.740 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:27:06.769 --> 00:27:06.779 align:start position:0%
um chairman
 
00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:10.200 align:start position:0%
uh uh yes representative Weber point
 
00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
point of question to the chair this is
 
00:27:16.909 --> 00:27:16.919 align:start position:0%
our time to receive information from the
 
00:27:18.789 --> 00:27:18.799 align:start position:0%
person sitting at the chair not give it
 
00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:22.440 align:start position:0%
and we have chances to talk among
 
00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
ourselves afterwards and draft among
 
00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
ourselves afterwards and certainly give
 
00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:29.340 align:start position:0%
our opinions knowledge and wisdom at the
 
00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
well yeah Mr Mr chairman can follow
 
00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:34.450 align:start position:0%
well yeah Mr Mr chairman can follow
later

00:27:34.450 --> 00:27:34.460 align:start position:0%
later
 
00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:37.380 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro
 
00:27:39.409 --> 00:27:39.419 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:27:41.029 --> 00:27:41.039 align:start position:0%
taking the question in fact thank you
 
00:27:41.039 --> 00:27:42.649 align:start position:0%
taking the question in fact thank you
for

00:27:42.649 --> 00:27:42.659 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:46.140 align:start position:0%
being so thorough and so sensitive to
 
00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:47.029 align:start position:0%
being so thorough and so sensitive to
the

00:27:47.029 --> 00:27:47.039 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:50.340 align:start position:0%
you know what's in law already and
 
00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:53.460 align:start position:0%
what's not in law and how um complicated
 
00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:56.460 align:start position:0%
it is because it really is incredibly
 
00:28:00.649 --> 00:28:00.659 align:start position:0%
complicated so in terms of complications
 
00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:04.200 align:start position:0%
I see that you've tried and and in Roman
 
00:28:07.909 --> 00:28:07.919 align:start position:0%
numeral two that you've talked about
 
00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:10.440 align:start position:0%
um what could be further exceptions
 
00:28:13.669 --> 00:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
besides what's in law if there was some
 
00:28:15.529 --> 00:28:15.539 align:start position:0%
kind of danger to the child specifically
 
00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
domestic violence and the last line on
 
00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:23.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
could endanger the child and
 
00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:28.740 align:start position:0%
um I guess I'm wondering if you've given
 
00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:31.020 align:start position:0%
any thought to that
 
00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
that phrase because that phrase is
 
00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:37.260 align:start position:0%
somewhat subjective especially
 
00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:38.330 align:start position:0%
somewhat subjective especially
um

00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:38.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:40.500 align:start position:0%
the mental health field
 
00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
um when we're talking about not not
 
00:28:45.769 --> 00:28:45.779 align:start position:0%
necessarily physical danger but you know
 
00:28:47.269 --> 00:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
what might be
 
00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
traumatic or be problematic for somebody
 
00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:54.360 align:start position:0%
who's in therapy for example I don't
 
00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
have a better phrase to give you but um
 
00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:00.900 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if you feel like that may
 
00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
be still leave things open to a great
 
00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:05.460 align:start position:0%
deal of subjectivity
 
00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:08.100 align:start position:0%
I I thank you for for your question and
 
00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:13.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:15.409 --> 00:29:15.419 align:start position:0%
think that there is potentially room to
 
00:29:18.289 --> 00:29:18.299 align:start position:0%
to tighten that up my concern is that if
 
00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:20.520 align:start position:0%
it's tightened up too much it doesn't
 
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
give Mental Health Providers the
 
00:29:26.029 --> 00:29:26.039 align:start position:0%
the decision-making power that they
 
00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:29.220 align:start position:0%
necessarily need I would say that
 
00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:29.810 align:start position:0%
necessarily need I would say that
um

00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:29.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:32.049 --> 00:29:32.059 align:start position:0%
could endanger the child
 
00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:36.360 align:start position:0%
to me generally means the the physical
 
00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:38.340 align:start position:0%
health welfare and well-being of the
 
00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:40.440 align:start position:0%
child and as soon as I say well-being
 
00:29:42.529 --> 00:29:42.539 align:start position:0%
we're crossing over into the subjective
 
00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:45.720 align:start position:0%
territory again I actually believe that
 
00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
um with this bill in place it's it's
 
00:29:49.549 --> 00:29:49.559 align:start position:0%
highly likely that people in the mental
 
00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:52.020 align:start position:0%
health profession would probably
 
00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
um begin sort of sort of their intake
 
00:29:57.230 --> 00:29:57.240 align:start position:0%
process might include a waiver of
 
00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
confidentiality statement uh the parents
 
00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:01.860 align:start position:0%
would sign that would acknowledge
 
00:30:04.130 --> 00:30:04.140 align:start position:0%
because if a parent I think is taking
 
00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:05.640 align:start position:0%
their child to a mental health
 
00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
professional or consenting to Mental
 
00:30:09.649 --> 00:30:09.659 align:start position:0%
Health Services from a professional that
 
00:30:11.090 --> 00:30:11.100 align:start position:0%
it would
 
00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
um it would be prudent for them to
 
00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:15.240 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that part of the value of
 
00:30:17.269 --> 00:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
that relationship is the ability for
 
00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:20.460 align:start position:0%
that child to have Frank and open
 
00:30:23.210 --> 00:30:23.220 align:start position:0%
conversations with a trusted adult and
 
00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
so so I would imagine that that would
 
00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:28.440 align:start position:0%
potentially become part of a standard
 
00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:29.350 align:start position:0%
potentially become part of a standard
practice

00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:29.360 align:start position:0%
practice
 
00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
in taking on new patients and that that
 
00:30:34.669 --> 00:30:34.679 align:start position:0%
would resolve a lot of those kinds of of
 
00:30:34.679 --> 00:30:37.370 align:start position:0%
would resolve a lot of those kinds of of
concerns

00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:37.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:40.020 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions
 
00:30:42.409 --> 00:30:42.419 align:start position:0%
yes representative McKay
 
00:30:44.409 --> 00:30:44.419 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:30:48.769 --> 00:30:48.779 align:start position:0%
this is a follow-up on my friend's uh
 
00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:52.380 align:start position:0%
mental health discussion I I had a
 
00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
situation that is it a question
 
00:30:57.529 --> 00:30:57.539 align:start position:0%
representative yes I'm getting a bad
 
00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
reputation but would you believe that
 
00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:04.269 align:start position:0%
reputation but would you believe that
that

00:31:04.269 --> 00:31:04.279 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
there are some very serious
 
00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:09.320 align:start position:0%
complications in the mental health field
 
00:31:12.529 --> 00:31:12.539 align:start position:0%
this this was a situation where the
 
00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:15.240 align:start position:0%
mother had custody of the child
 
00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
the parents hadn't got divorced yet but
 
00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
were in the process of getting a divorce
 
00:31:23.169 --> 00:31:23.179 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:31:23.179 --> 00:31:25.029 align:start position:0%
the the
Sun

00:31:25.029 --> 00:31:25.039 align:start position:0%
Sun
 
00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:27.320 align:start position:0%
that I was seeing
 
00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
was very torn between both parents
 
00:31:34.909 --> 00:31:34.919 align:start position:0%
the father came to me and said I want
 
00:31:36.529 --> 00:31:36.539 align:start position:0%
all of his records
 
00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
and I said in essence you can go to hell
 
00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:41.340 align:start position:0%
because you're not getting any records
 
00:31:42.649 --> 00:31:42.659 align:start position:0%
from me
 
00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:46.200 align:start position:0%
I had no idea where that could lead to
 
00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:49.250 align:start position:0%
I had no idea where that could lead to
that

00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:49.810 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:31:49.810 --> 00:31:49.820 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:52.440 align:start position:0%
situation was extremely difficult
 
00:31:57.430 --> 00:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
because this man had sued several local
 
00:31:59.870 --> 00:31:59.880 align:start position:0%
Selectmen and other elected type
 
00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:01.370 align:start position:0%
Selectmen and other elected type
individuals

00:32:01.370 --> 00:32:01.380 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
00:32:04.370 --> 00:32:04.380 align:start position:0%
to make a long story short this was
 
00:32:06.049 --> 00:32:06.059 align:start position:0%
something that I was never trained to
 
00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:09.240 align:start position:0%
deal with it's not a medical thing it's
 
00:32:12.610 --> 00:32:12.620 align:start position:0%
a PhD thing and they're very similar
 
00:32:15.649 --> 00:32:15.659 align:start position:0%
what saved the day for me is that this
 
00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:19.500 align:start position:0%
fellow turned 18. the day before and
 
00:32:21.649 --> 00:32:21.659 align:start position:0%
said they're my records he's not getting
 
00:32:26.090 --> 00:32:26.100 align:start position:0%
them but that from an educational point
 
00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:28.860 align:start position:0%
of view this presents extremely
 
00:32:31.850 --> 00:32:31.860 align:start position:0%
complicated issues particularly in the
 
00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
mental health field
 
00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:37.320 align:start position:0%
so first of all thank you I want to say
 
00:32:39.049 --> 00:32:39.059 align:start position:0%
thank you for for standing up for your
 
00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:40.860 align:start position:0%
patient doing what I think was the right
 
00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:44.100 align:start position:0%
thing the bird versus bird case was very
 
00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:46.140 align:start position:0%
very similar to that it was a divorce
 
00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:47.940 align:start position:0%
case it was a case in which the the
 
00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:50.940 align:start position:0%
father was serving his own interests not
 
00:32:53.149 --> 00:32:53.159 align:start position:0%
the the best interest of the child and
 
00:32:55.250 --> 00:32:55.260 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Supreme Court came
 
00:32:58.430 --> 00:32:58.440 align:start position:0%
down firmly uh in favor of keeping those
 
00:33:00.409 --> 00:33:00.419 align:start position:0%
medical records private because the the
 
00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
parent was not requesting them in the
 
00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
best interest of the child
 
00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:11.580 align:start position:0%
yes representative McLean just a just a
 
00:33:13.789 --> 00:33:13.799 align:start position:0%
quick question just kind of cement my
 
00:33:16.009 --> 00:33:16.019 align:start position:0%
understanding of the current process So
 
00:33:16.019 --> 00:33:17.210 align:start position:0%
understanding of the current process So
currently

00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:17.220 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:33:20.149 --> 00:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned that um you received a
 
00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:22.440 align:start position:0%
letter that says we we can't even give
 
00:33:24.169 --> 00:33:24.179 align:start position:0%
you lab results but it's my
 
00:33:27.169 --> 00:33:27.179 align:start position:0%
understanding that if a parent wanted to
 
00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:29.580 align:start position:0%
act something let's say it was hey you
 
00:33:32.029 --> 00:33:32.039 align:start position:0%
have cancer and so you have to go
 
00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:34.260 align:start position:0%
forward we want to have surgery so that
 
00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:37.740 align:start position:0%
would require parental consent I would
 
00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:38.810 align:start position:0%
would require parental consent I would
assume

00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:38.820 align:start position:0%
assume
 
00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:42.120 align:start position:0%
so it's not an emergency yes there are
 
00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:43.980 align:start position:0%
some exceptions if it's an emergency
 
00:33:47.450 --> 00:33:47.460 align:start position:0%
situation yes so so okay so that's in
 
00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
that case it already is it would be
 
00:33:50.810 --> 00:33:50.820 align:start position:0%
disclosed in order to get parental
 
00:33:53.149 --> 00:33:53.159 align:start position:0%
consent they would have to disclose that
 
00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:58.730 --> 00:33:58.740 align:start position:0%
informed consent would dictate that yes
 
00:34:00.049 --> 00:34:00.059 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:34:03.169 --> 00:34:03.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:05.570 --> 00:34:05.580 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions okay thank you
 
00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:11.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:13.919 align:start position:0%
also signed up to testify is Paula
 
00:34:15.409 --> 00:34:15.419 align:start position:0%

foreign

00:34:42.490 --> 00:34:42.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:44.869 --> 00:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman members of the committee for
 
00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:46.560 align:start position:0%

Senior vice president state government

relations with the New Hampshire
 
00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:50.580 align:start position:0%
Hospital Association representing all
 
00:34:52.490 --> 00:34:52.500 align:start position:0%
our hospitals throughout the state we
 
00:34:55.490 --> 00:34:55.500 align:start position:0%
are opposed to House Bill 406 relative
 
00:34:58.550 --> 00:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
to release of teenagers medical records
 
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
to a parent or Guardian this bill is
 
00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:02.220 align:start position:0%
almost identical to a bill that was
 
00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
introduced last year House Bill 1345 we
 
00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:07.500 align:start position:0%
were opposed to that as well and had
 
00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
many concerns however House Bill 406 was
 
00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
amended to address some of the concerns
 
00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:16.020 align:start position:0%
at the health care Community has raised
 
00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:19.020 align:start position:0%
last year however we continue to believe
 
00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:21.420 align:start position:0%
that this bill is unnecessary as the
 
00:35:24.109 --> 00:35:24.119 align:start position:0%
health insurance portability and
 
00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:27.060 align:start position:0%
accountability act HIPAA already covers
 
00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:29.820 align:start position:0%
when a Minor's medical records can be
 
00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:32.460 align:start position:0%
released however if this bill were to
 
00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:34.500 align:start position:0%
move forward there is another major
 
00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
concern with the bill before you on line
 
00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:40.440 align:start position:0%
nine the word and after neglect needs to
 
00:35:43.370 --> 00:35:43.380 align:start position:0%
be changed to or it should be it should
 
00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:48.109 align:start position:0%
be changed to or it should be it should
read

00:35:48.109 --> 00:35:48.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:50.990 --> 00:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
I'm Excuse me
 
00:35:54.349 --> 00:35:54.359 align:start position:0%
so it goes the CH on line nine the child
 
00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
has been or may be subjected to domestic
 
00:36:00.109 --> 00:36:00.119 align:start position:0%
violence comma abuse or neglect comma
 
00:36:03.109 --> 00:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
and then it says and that the release of
 
00:36:04.849 --> 00:36:04.859 align:start position:0%
the medical records to the parent or
 
00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
Guardian shouldn't what could endanger
 
00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:10.200 align:start position:0%
the child it should be or that was that
 
00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
was debated last year
 
00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:14.460 align:start position:0%
um this bill like I said was made it to
 
00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
the Senate HHS but we um and other
 
00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:19.220 align:start position:0%
stakeholders that I think are here today
 
00:36:21.790 --> 00:36:21.800 align:start position:0%
that represent Health Care Providers
 
00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:24.720 align:start position:0%
requested that the and be changed to or
 
00:36:27.349 --> 00:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
the bill didn't go forward in the Senate
 
00:36:30.589 --> 00:36:30.599 align:start position:0%
HHS it was laid on the table but again
 
00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:33.780 align:start position:0%
that that is our request if in fact the
 
00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
committee determines it is necessary to
 
00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:40.200 align:start position:0%
move this bill forward we remain
 
00:36:42.290 --> 00:36:42.300 align:start position:0%
convinced that this bill is unnecessary
 
00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:43.800 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:36:46.010 --> 00:36:46.020 align:start position:0%
I am not an expert in this area this is
 
00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
very complex as you have identified and
 
00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:51.839 align:start position:0%
as representative Cole fault um I think
 
00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
did a great job trying to explain on
 
00:36:56.210 --> 00:36:56.220 align:start position:0%
this pretty complicated issue but if you
 
00:36:57.710 --> 00:36:57.720 align:start position:0%
have questions I'm happy to take them
 
00:36:59.030 --> 00:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
back and
 
00:37:00.530 --> 00:37:00.540 align:start position:0%
get you an answer
 
00:37:03.589 --> 00:37:03.599 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative Leon thank
 
00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you for being
 
00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:06.540 align:start position:0%
here today
 
00:37:08.210 --> 00:37:08.220 align:start position:0%
um I was wondering if you could speak
 
00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:10.140 align:start position:0%
with Exeter Hospital and see what their
 
00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
current policy is regarding the release
 
00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
of miners records so that we can
 
00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:15.900 align:start position:0%
understand that this is an ongoing issue
 
00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
today or not
 
00:37:20.650 --> 00:37:20.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:24.660 align:start position:0%
I apologize yeah I I very much doubt
 
00:37:26.329 --> 00:37:26.339 align:start position:0%
that they are violating any laws because
 
00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
of HIPAA but I am happy to look into it
 
00:37:30.170 --> 00:37:30.180 align:start position:0%
I would love if he could confirm that
 
00:37:32.569 --> 00:37:32.579 align:start position:0%
for us thank you sure
 
00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:36.060 align:start position:0%
yes representative Shapiro
 
00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you uh
 
00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:40.740 align:start position:0%
Mr Shanahan for taking my question
 
00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:43.380 align:start position:0%
um I understand you saying that um your
 
00:37:45.050 --> 00:37:45.060 align:start position:0%
opinion is that this is not necessary
 
00:37:48.109 --> 00:37:48.119 align:start position:0%
and maybe duplicative
 
00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:51.780 align:start position:0%
um but I'm wondering if you or the
 
00:37:54.349 --> 00:37:54.359 align:start position:0%
providers you represent
 
00:37:54.359 --> 00:37:55.390 align:start position:0%
providers you represent
um

00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:55.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:59.450 --> 00:37:59.460 align:start position:0%
could tell us what problems might occur
 
00:38:03.589 --> 00:38:03.599 align:start position:0%
because of a a law like this
 
00:38:05.930 --> 00:38:05.940 align:start position:0%
um let let me get you something in
 
00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:06.829 align:start position:0%
um let let me get you something in
writing

00:38:06.829 --> 00:38:06.839 align:start position:0%
writing
 
00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
because again this is a complicated
 
00:38:11.810 --> 00:38:11.820 align:start position:0%
issue and and I know you appreciate that
 
00:38:15.470 --> 00:38:15.480 align:start position:0%
so let me get you a thorough response
 
00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:17.640 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:38:21.349 --> 00:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
representative McLean thank you Mr uh
 
00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Miss Manor for taking my
 
00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
question are you aware of any elements
 
00:38:28.370 --> 00:38:28.380 align:start position:0%
of this law that is in conflict with
 
00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:32.280 align:start position:0%
HIPAA and if so you know what is a
 
00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:34.740 align:start position:0%
normal resolution does HIPAA Trump
 
00:38:37.310 --> 00:38:37.320 align:start position:0%
in that case
 
00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
so our state has a more restrictive
 
00:38:43.849 --> 00:38:43.859 align:start position:0%
HIPAA law than the federal government so
 
00:38:45.770 --> 00:38:45.780 align:start position:0%
the state HIPAA
 
00:38:48.050 --> 00:38:48.060 align:start position:0%
privacy laws Trump
 
00:38:51.290 --> 00:38:51.300 align:start position:0%
um any you can be more restrictive than
 
00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh but not less restrictive than the
 
00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:53.810 align:start position:0%
uh but not less restrictive than the
federal

00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:53.820 align:start position:0%
federal
 
00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:56.640 align:start position:0%
um so again not I am not a HIPAA expert
 
00:39:00.050 --> 00:39:00.060 align:start position:0%
either this is a very very complicated
 
00:39:02.329 --> 00:39:02.339 align:start position:0%
um uh area of of
 
00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:04.680 align:start position:0%
um Health policy and law so
 
00:39:06.530 --> 00:39:06.540 align:start position:0%
um I don't know that I can answer your
 
00:39:10.250 --> 00:39:10.260 align:start position:0%
question thoroughly follow up so so but
 
00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:11.700 align:start position:0%
to the best of your knowledge this this
 
00:39:14.329 --> 00:39:14.339 align:start position:0%
is within the constraints of HIPAA you
 
00:39:14.339 --> 00:39:16.609 align:start position:0%
is within the constraints of HIPAA you
believe

00:39:16.609 --> 00:39:16.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
um as
 
00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
representative kofault indicated um
 
00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:22.200 align:start position:0%
HIPAA is
 
00:39:25.370 --> 00:39:25.380 align:start position:0%
um contemplated in this bill
 
00:39:27.410 --> 00:39:27.420 align:start position:0%
um as an exception
 
00:39:30.170 --> 00:39:30.180 align:start position:0%
um when they would not be able to
 
00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
release medical records so it's you know
 
00:39:35.210 --> 00:39:35.220 align:start position:0%
it's it's Roman 3.
 
00:39:37.849 --> 00:39:37.859 align:start position:0%
um so HIPAA is contemplated
 
00:39:41.589 --> 00:39:41.599 align:start position:0%
um in this bill again our
 
00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
concern is well two things one we don't
 
00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:46.260 align:start position:0%
believe it's necessary second of all
 
00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:47.690 align:start position:0%
believe it's necessary second of all
again

00:39:47.690 --> 00:39:47.700 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:39:49.569 --> 00:39:49.579 align:start position:0%
um the and should be changed to or
 
00:39:52.370 --> 00:39:52.380 align:start position:0%
because that is one word but it's uh
 
00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
it's an important word
 
00:39:56.930 --> 00:39:56.940 align:start position:0%
um so the and if it read or that the
 
00:39:58.910 --> 00:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
release of medical records could
 
00:40:01.010 --> 00:40:01.020 align:start position:0%
endanger the child and I think that
 
00:40:03.349 --> 00:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
addresses um representative McKay and
 
00:40:06.410 --> 00:40:06.420 align:start position:0%
other clinicians on the committee's um
 
00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:07.970 align:start position:0%
other clinicians on the committee's um
concerns

00:40:07.970 --> 00:40:07.980 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
yeah other questions yes representative
 
00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:13.490 align:start position:0%
yeah other questions yes representative
Weber

00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:13.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:15.349 --> 00:40:15.359 align:start position:0%
I can't believe I'm actually asking this
 
00:40:15.359 --> 00:40:16.609 align:start position:0%
I can't believe I'm actually asking this
but

00:40:16.609 --> 00:40:16.619 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:40:18.829 --> 00:40:18.839 align:start position:0%
um as I read it
 
00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
obviously the or is necessary for to
 
00:40:27.349 --> 00:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
cover the issue of a child who was not
 
00:40:30.050 --> 00:40:30.060 align:start position:0%
previously abused or neglected but might
 
00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:32.220 align:start position:0%
be in the future if the records were
 
00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:33.230 align:start position:0%
be in the future if the records were
released

00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:33.240 align:start position:0%
released
 
00:40:38.810 --> 00:40:38.820 align:start position:0%
but uh doesn't isn't that covered by the
 
00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
phrase the child has been or may be
 
00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:43.609 align:start position:0%
phrase the child has been or may be
subjected

00:40:43.609 --> 00:40:43.619 align:start position:0%
subjected
 
00:40:46.930 --> 00:40:46.940 align:start position:0%
to domestic violence abuse or neglect
 
00:40:48.829 --> 00:40:48.839 align:start position:0%
does that
 
00:40:51.770 --> 00:40:51.780 align:start position:0%
change the need for the ore
 
00:40:55.849 --> 00:40:55.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:59.510 --> 00:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that it covers thank you
 
00:41:00.890 --> 00:41:00.900 align:start position:0%
for your question I'm not sure that it
 
00:41:03.050 --> 00:41:03.060 align:start position:0%
covers every
 
00:41:05.569 --> 00:41:05.579 align:start position:0%
circumstance potentially
 
00:41:07.609 --> 00:41:07.619 align:start position:0%
I know that there are others here that
 
00:41:11.569 --> 00:41:11.579 align:start position:0%
are more expert in this area relative to
 
00:41:14.210 --> 00:41:14.220 align:start position:0%
mental health so um hopefully they can
 
00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:15.900 align:start position:0%
raise other
 
00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
um answer that question more thoroughly
 
00:41:19.849 --> 00:41:19.859 align:start position:0%
and could I have a follow-up follow-up
 
00:41:21.770 --> 00:41:21.780 align:start position:0%
as I'm as I keep reading this over and
 
00:41:26.089 --> 00:41:26.099 align:start position:0%
over uh could the difference be that the
 
00:41:28.010 --> 00:41:28.020 align:start position:0%
standard in the first half of the
 
00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
sentence is subjected to domestic
 
00:41:32.329 --> 00:41:32.339 align:start position:0%
violence or abuse or neglect and the
 
00:41:34.609 --> 00:41:34.619 align:start position:0%
second part of the sentence
 
00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:37.260 align:start position:0%
says release of the medical records
 
00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:39.240 align:start position:0%
could endanger the child and doesn't
 
00:41:42.290 --> 00:41:42.300 align:start position:0%
specify how so it might be broader yes
 
00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:44.460 align:start position:0%
okay yes I agree
 
00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative
 
00:41:48.650 --> 00:41:48.660 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you thank you Mr chair
 
00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:50.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Ms minnehan for taking the
 
00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:51.109 align:start position:0%
thank you Ms minnehan for taking the
question

00:41:51.109 --> 00:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:41:54.290 --> 00:41:54.300 align:start position:0%
in regards to the HIPAA what I heard was
 
00:41:58.550 --> 00:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
State HIPAA law is more strict than the
 
00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:00.720 align:start position:0%
federal but this only
 
00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:03.660 align:start position:0%
goes back to the quote Federal not to
 
00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
the state so should we include reference
 
00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:07.980 align:start position:0%
to the state HIPAA as well as the
 
00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:10.260 align:start position:0%
federal to ensure that we have the more
 
00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:12.660 align:start position:0%
stringent one included in the bill
 
00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
except at the beginning on line six
 
00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
as directed by federal or specific state
 
00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
law so it may be covered there
 
00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
again this is um a small it's a it's a
 
00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
simple bill it looks like a simple bill
 
00:42:28.849 --> 00:42:28.859 align:start position:0%
but it's not it's it's really
 
00:42:28.859 --> 00:42:29.990 align:start position:0%
but it's not it's it's really
complicated

00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:31.740 align:start position:0%
um and we just got to make sure that I
 
00:42:34.609 --> 00:42:34.619 align:start position:0%
we believe we want to make sure that um
 
00:42:36.589 --> 00:42:36.599 align:start position:0%
uh miners
 
00:42:38.450 --> 00:42:38.460 align:start position:0%
um over the age of um you know between
 
00:42:41.450 --> 00:42:41.460 align:start position:0%
13 and 19 I think that's what this yeah
 
00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:44.640 align:start position:0%
18 excuse me are um protected
 
00:42:47.450 --> 00:42:47.460 align:start position:0%
um as they um as the law contemplates
 
00:42:50.270 --> 00:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
but you make a good point maybe it needs
 
00:42:53.569 --> 00:42:53.579 align:start position:0%
more clarity I just again why do we call
 
00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
it out in number three HIPAA when we
 
00:42:58.250 --> 00:42:58.260 align:start position:0%
have online
 
00:42:58.260 --> 00:42:58.970 align:start position:0%
have online
um

00:42:58.970 --> 00:42:58.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:01.800 align:start position:0%
6 that we say both federal and state but
 
00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
we then refer to HIPAA in line 12.
 
00:43:07.490 --> 00:43:07.500 align:start position:0%
so I just want to be clear that we're
 
00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:10.200 align:start position:0%
consistent with a reference to HIPAA
 
00:43:11.809 --> 00:43:11.819 align:start position:0%
both at the federal and state level and
 
00:43:11.819 --> 00:43:12.650 align:start position:0%
both at the federal and state level and
line

00:43:12.650 --> 00:43:12.660 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:16.490 align:start position:0%
line
12.

00:43:16.490 --> 00:43:16.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:19.849 --> 00:43:19.859 align:start position:0%
valid point representative King
 
00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman thank you for taking
 
00:43:24.890 --> 00:43:24.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:27.829 --> 00:43:27.839 align:start position:0%
on issues that are present I and
 
00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
confusing I like to look to our
 
00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:33.180 align:start position:0%
ancestors for guidance surely issues
 
00:43:36.170 --> 00:43:36.180 align:start position:0%
like this must have come up in the 1800s
 
00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
early 1900s
 
00:43:41.630 --> 00:43:41.640 align:start position:0%
somebody 15 years old going to a doctor
 
00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:43.560 align:start position:0%
and the parents maybe didn't know or
 
00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
they did know
 
00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
can you tell me I don't know if you have
 
00:43:47.809 --> 00:43:47.819 align:start position:0%
this information but can you tell me
 
00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
what it was like back in the day did
 
00:43:53.329 --> 00:43:53.339 align:start position:0%
parents always have the ability to get
 
00:43:55.609 --> 00:43:55.619 align:start position:0%
this information or was it understood
 
00:43:57.710 --> 00:43:57.720 align:start position:0%
that nope 15 year olds that's their
 
00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
private information I mean I just like
 
00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
to look to our ancestors what can our
 
00:44:04.130 --> 00:44:04.140 align:start position:0%
ancestors tell us around back then I
 
00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:06.240 align:start position:0%
know I was going to say that is kind of
 
00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
a slight to my age I think but I'll try
 
00:44:12.530 --> 00:44:12.540 align:start position:0%
not to take it that way um I do not know
 
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
the answer to that
 
00:44:16.309 --> 00:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
um and I think you have some experts on
 
00:44:18.970 --> 00:44:18.980 align:start position:0%
the committee that are have um were are
 
00:44:22.130 --> 00:44:22.140 align:start position:0%
or were Physicians that maybe can um
 
00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
help you a little bit more as far as the
 
00:44:27.770 --> 00:44:27.780 align:start position:0%
historical nature of um how health care
 
00:44:30.290 --> 00:44:30.300 align:start position:0%
was handled back in the whenever the
 
00:44:33.349 --> 00:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
ancestors but um I do not know the
 
00:44:35.450 --> 00:44:35.460 align:start position:0%
answer to that
 
00:44:37.849 --> 00:44:37.859 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman thank you Mr
 
00:44:39.890 --> 00:44:39.900 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:44:42.109 --> 00:44:42.119 align:start position:0%
question uh
 
00:44:46.069 --> 00:44:46.079 align:start position:0%
I I'm thinking about how parents are you
 
00:44:47.930 --> 00:44:47.940 align:start position:0%
know it's accepted that in most
 
00:44:49.309 --> 00:44:49.319 align:start position:0%
situations they have the best interest
 
00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
of the child in mind and I'm wondering
 
00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
does the New Hampshire Hospital
 
00:44:57.050 --> 00:44:57.060 align:start position:0%
Association have any guidance that they
 
00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
give to the hospital systems uh
 
00:45:03.349 --> 00:45:03.359 align:start position:0%
regarding this and you know reminding
 
00:45:06.170 --> 00:45:06.180 align:start position:0%
them that they can't just keep records
 
00:45:08.450 --> 00:45:08.460 align:start position:0%
closed and if the law is truly
 
00:45:11.210 --> 00:45:11.220 align:start position:0%
unnecessary you know is there do they
 
00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:13.020 align:start position:0%
have guidance on that from you guys uh
 
00:45:15.410 --> 00:45:15.420 align:start position:0%
HIPAA guides them um we don't need to
 
00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
guide them the federal I mean they know
 
00:45:18.890 --> 00:45:18.900 align:start position:0%
about HIPAA so it's really the
 
00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:21.720 align:start position:0%
overarching Privacy requirements federal
 
00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
and state law
 
00:45:25.609 --> 00:45:25.619 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you
 
00:45:27.050 --> 00:45:27.060 align:start position:0%
um well we just heard and I've heard
 
00:45:29.390 --> 00:45:29.400 align:start position:0%
personally from parents that these these
 
00:45:31.370 --> 00:45:31.380 align:start position:0%
policies do exist and there have been
 
00:45:33.170 --> 00:45:33.180 align:start position:0%
emails and I know sometimes you don't
 
00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:34.740 align:start position:0%
like to believe parents when they're
 
00:45:36.349 --> 00:45:36.359 align:start position:0%
telling you these things but it is
 
00:45:38.569 --> 00:45:38.579 align:start position:0%
happening so I think there there does
 
00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:40.200 align:start position:0%
need to be some guidance and would you
 
00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
consider bringing that to the New
 
00:45:44.329 --> 00:45:44.339 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Hospital Association
 
00:45:46.550 --> 00:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
if this law is truly unnecessary and
 
00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
just using your your power in your
 
00:45:51.530 --> 00:45:51.540 align:start position:0%
organization to deal with the problem
 
00:45:53.390 --> 00:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman what you just
 
00:45:55.970 --> 00:45:55.980 align:start position:0%
said was insulting to me I do believe
 
00:45:58.790 --> 00:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
parents um we we are I represent
 
00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
hospitals and they treat parents and
 
00:46:04.250 --> 00:46:04.260 align:start position:0%
children and um and all sorts of
 
00:46:07.010 --> 00:46:07.020 align:start position:0%
patients and for you to stay that was
 
00:46:09.349 --> 00:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
insulting to me so I I will not answer
 
00:46:11.870 --> 00:46:11.880 align:start position:0%
your question I certainly will talk with
 
00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:14.640 align:start position:0%
the hospitals but please do not insult
 
00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:16.920 align:start position:0%
um me in the future I think I'm all set
 
00:46:19.069 --> 00:46:19.079 align:start position:0%
thank you I apologize I was not
 
00:46:21.530 --> 00:46:21.540 align:start position:0%
intending to insult you just going off
 
00:46:23.569 --> 00:46:23.579 align:start position:0%
of our previous experiences together
 
00:46:26.089 --> 00:46:26.099 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:46:26.099 --> 00:46:27.109 align:start position:0%
thank you
foreign

00:46:27.109 --> 00:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:46:29.809 --> 00:46:29.819 align:start position:0%
also signed up to testify is Sam Hawkins
 
00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:38.809 --> 00:46:38.819 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative Palmer
 
00:46:40.849 --> 00:46:40.859 align:start position:0%
I'd just like to make a comment about
 
00:46:43.490 --> 00:46:43.500 align:start position:0%
HIPAA that perhaps we should offline
 
00:46:46.069 --> 00:46:46.079 align:start position:0%
review that because it is
 
00:46:49.250 --> 00:46:49.260 align:start position:0%
um it's a very strict law and hospitals
 
00:46:51.710 --> 00:46:51.720 align:start position:0%
are extremely and and medical practices
 
00:46:54.109 --> 00:46:54.119 align:start position:0%
are extremely wary of it because the
 
00:46:57.170 --> 00:46:57.180 align:start position:0%
penalties are huge so a lot of the
 
00:46:59.650 --> 00:46:59.660 align:start position:0%
reason that people are so wary about
 
00:47:02.329 --> 00:47:02.339 align:start position:0%
institutions and Physicians are so wary
 
00:47:04.309 --> 00:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
about giving out this information is
 
00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
because they can they can end up in
 
00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:09.480 align:start position:0%
court and so I just would suggest that
 
00:47:11.630 --> 00:47:11.640 align:start position:0%
people familiarize themselves with that
 
00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
law a little bit because that's part of
 
00:47:17.809 --> 00:47:17.819 align:start position:0%
what the problem is here okay thank you
 
00:47:20.210 --> 00:47:20.220 align:start position:0%
good morning sir good morning minutes
 
00:47:21.829 --> 00:47:21.839 align:start position:0%
please yes
 
00:47:23.690 --> 00:47:23.700 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chairman to the committee
 
00:47:25.490 --> 00:47:25.500 align:start position:0%
for the opportunity to testify today my
 
00:47:26.870 --> 00:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
name is Sam Hawkins I'm the public
 
00:47:28.910 --> 00:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
policy assistant at Nami New Hampshire
 
00:47:30.770 --> 00:47:30.780 align:start position:0%
uh the National Alliance on Mental
 
00:47:32.510 --> 00:47:32.520 align:start position:0%
Illness Nami New Hampshire is a
 
00:47:34.490 --> 00:47:34.500 align:start position:0%
non-profit Grassroots organization whose
 
00:47:35.870 --> 00:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
mission is to improve the lives of all
 
00:47:37.609 --> 00:47:37.619 align:start position:0%
people impacted by mental illness and
 
00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:39.480 align:start position:0%
suicide through support education and
 
00:47:41.809 --> 00:47:41.819 align:start position:0%
advocacy on behalf of Nami I'm here
 
00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
today to speak in opposition to HB 406
 
00:47:45.589 --> 00:47:45.599 align:start position:0%
and I'll keep my comments brief because
 
00:47:47.569 --> 00:47:47.579 align:start position:0%
our stance is very close to the New
 
00:47:49.849 --> 00:47:49.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital associations we
 
00:47:51.530 --> 00:47:51.540 align:start position:0%
recognize the importance of familial
 
00:47:53.150 --> 00:47:53.160 align:start position:0%
support throughout our system of care
 
00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
for children's mental health and in our
 
00:47:56.809 --> 00:47:56.819 align:start position:0%
experience counselors and therapists who
 
00:47:58.670 --> 00:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
are proficient in their practice will
 
00:48:00.410 --> 00:48:00.420 align:start position:0%
involve the family including the parents
 
00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
and Guardians and the treatment of an
 
00:48:04.130 --> 00:48:04.140 align:start position:0%
adolescent patient
 
00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:05.640 align:start position:0%
but we do know where there are some
 
00:48:07.250 --> 00:48:07.260 align:start position:0%
situations where a child may be
 
00:48:08.990 --> 00:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
endangered by the disclosure of mental
 
00:48:10.670 --> 00:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
health records and for these children we
 
00:48:12.050 --> 00:48:12.060 align:start position:0%
believe that access to a private
 
00:48:14.569 --> 00:48:14.579 align:start position:0%
therapeutic relationship is essential so
 
00:48:15.829 --> 00:48:15.839 align:start position:0%
we would be asking for the same thing
 
00:48:16.730 --> 00:48:16.740 align:start position:0%
about the New Hampshire Hospital
 
00:48:18.530 --> 00:48:18.540 align:start position:0%
Association would be asking for is that
 
00:48:21.290 --> 00:48:21.300 align:start position:0%
and on line nine changed to an or if
 
00:48:22.730 --> 00:48:22.740 align:start position:0%
that were to be changed our position
 
00:48:24.770 --> 00:48:24.780 align:start position:0%
would be neutral on this but as
 
00:48:28.370 --> 00:48:28.380 align:start position:0%
introduced we are opposed thank you
 
00:48:31.069 --> 00:48:31.079 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Leon thank you
 
00:48:32.690 --> 00:48:32.700 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you very much for
 
00:48:34.069 --> 00:48:34.079 align:start position:0%
being here
 
00:48:36.170 --> 00:48:36.180 align:start position:0%
um we're dealing with all sorts of
 
00:48:38.030 --> 00:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
problems today in our society we
 
00:48:39.290 --> 00:48:39.300 align:start position:0%
actually just lost somebody in my
 
00:48:43.010 --> 00:48:43.020 align:start position:0%
community the other day my question is
 
00:48:46.010 --> 00:48:46.020 align:start position:0%
if there's a provider who is seeing a
 
00:48:48.770 --> 00:48:48.780 align:start position:0%
child who has potential suicidal
 
00:48:51.410 --> 00:48:51.420 align:start position:0%
ideation and the parent does not know
 
00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
about that not because of any specific
 
00:48:56.089 --> 00:48:56.099 align:start position:0%
threat but because in general I think
 
00:48:57.710 --> 00:48:57.720 align:start position:0%
that could hurt the parents that could
 
00:48:59.750 --> 00:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
hurt the child and then that child does
 
00:49:01.849 --> 00:49:01.859 align:start position:0%
follow through on that is there anything
 
00:49:03.829 --> 00:49:03.839 align:start position:0%
being done to catch that from falling
 
00:49:05.329 --> 00:49:05.339 align:start position:0%
through the tracks because I think every
 
00:49:07.250 --> 00:49:07.260 align:start position:0%
parent I don't do you agree with me that
 
00:49:09.109 --> 00:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
every parent should have the chance to
 
00:49:10.370 --> 00:49:10.380 align:start position:0%
support their child while they're still
 
00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:11.450 align:start position:0%
support their child while they're still
alive

00:49:11.450 --> 00:49:11.460 align:start position:0%
alive
 
00:49:13.730 --> 00:49:13.740 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your question
 
00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:17.690 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your question
um

00:49:17.690 --> 00:49:17.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:20.930 --> 00:49:20.940 align:start position:0%
if if a provider believes it is my my
 
00:49:22.730 --> 00:49:22.740 align:start position:0%
belief that I'm not sure if it's if it's
 
00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
in law or just standards I believe it's
 
00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
in law that if a provider believes that
 
00:49:29.210 --> 00:49:29.220 align:start position:0%
there is a real harmed self or others
 
00:49:31.069 --> 00:49:31.079 align:start position:0%
for the child they are under a duty to
 
00:49:33.349 --> 00:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
act and a duty to report
 
00:49:35.630 --> 00:49:35.640 align:start position:0%
um of course there are still still kids
 
00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
who slip through the cracks and that is
 
00:49:38.809 --> 00:49:38.819 align:start position:0%
very tragic but I do believe that
 
00:49:41.690 --> 00:49:41.700 align:start position:0%
there's still a duty to act relevant to
 
00:49:44.030 --> 00:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
what you're asking
 
00:49:46.670 --> 00:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
follow up um thank you and um if there
 
00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
are any processes to find those children
 
00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
who slip through the cracks I'd really
 
00:49:52.609 --> 00:49:52.619 align:start position:0%
be help happy to find out about that and
 
00:49:54.170 --> 00:49:54.180 align:start position:0%
support those efforts with you yeah
 
00:49:55.730 --> 00:49:55.740 align:start position:0%
that's what I think thank you
 
00:49:58.309 --> 00:49:58.319 align:start position:0%
representative McLean thank you Mr chair
 
00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question
 
00:50:03.109 --> 00:50:03.119 align:start position:0%
um I just I'm curious we had a lot of
 
00:50:04.730 --> 00:50:04.740 align:start position:0%
talk about disclosure versus
 
00:50:08.030 --> 00:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
non-disclosure and and HIPAA and I'm not
 
00:50:10.069 --> 00:50:10.079 align:start position:0%
a HIPAA expert so I guess I'm just
 
00:50:12.410 --> 00:50:12.420 align:start position:0%
trying to understand when
 
00:50:14.589 --> 00:50:14.599 align:start position:0%
um a provider or an institution
 
00:50:17.870 --> 00:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
implements its policy do they have
 
00:50:19.970 --> 00:50:19.980 align:start position:0%
discretion when they're implementing
 
00:50:22.550 --> 00:50:22.560 align:start position:0%
their disclosure policy
 
00:50:25.490 --> 00:50:25.500 align:start position:0%
to go beyond HIPAA in other words I know
 
00:50:28.490 --> 00:50:28.500 align:start position:0%
that they can't violate HIPAA but do
 
00:50:31.849 --> 00:50:31.859 align:start position:0%
they have the discretion to go even
 
00:50:33.710 --> 00:50:33.720 align:start position:0%
further that and say no HIPAA would
 
00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
allow this release but we are not going
 
00:50:37.490 --> 00:50:37.500 align:start position:0%
to I hope you understood what I'm saying
 
00:50:39.349 --> 00:50:39.359 align:start position:0%
I I think for your question I think I
 
00:50:41.329 --> 00:50:41.339 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying I'm not at
 
00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
all a hip expert as we've acknowledged
 
00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
this very complicated issue
 
00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:46.370 align:start position:0%
this very complicated issue
um

00:50:46.370 --> 00:50:46.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:48.109 --> 00:50:48.119 align:start position:0%
as to whether they can choose to
 
00:50:51.170 --> 00:50:51.180 align:start position:0%
withhold beyond what HIPAA um what what
 
00:50:52.730 --> 00:50:52.740 align:start position:0%
HIPAA requires
 
00:50:52.740 --> 00:50:53.569 align:start position:0%
HIPAA requires
um

00:50:53.569 --> 00:50:53.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:55.730 --> 00:50:55.740 align:start position:0%
I believe in the chase in the case of a
 
00:50:56.990 --> 00:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
relationship between a parent and a
 
00:50:58.910 --> 00:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
child and if laws like this were to pass
 
00:51:01.790 --> 00:51:01.800 align:start position:0%
they would not be able to do so
 
00:51:04.430 --> 00:51:04.440 align:start position:0%
follow-up but in in the current state do
 
00:51:05.930 --> 00:51:05.940 align:start position:0%
they have that discretion or you're not
 
00:51:07.309 --> 00:51:07.319 align:start position:0%
sure I'm not sure but I can look into
 
00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
that thank you
 
00:51:10.750 --> 00:51:10.760 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:51:13.609 --> 00:51:13.619 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:51:15.950 --> 00:51:15.960 align:start position:0%
yes representative King thank you
 
00:51:18.349 --> 00:51:18.359 align:start position:0%
chairman McDonald
 
00:51:20.690 --> 00:51:20.700 align:start position:0%
this bill is dealing with 13 to 18 year
 
00:51:20.700 --> 00:51:21.530 align:start position:0%
this bill is dealing with 13 to 18 year
olds

00:51:21.530 --> 00:51:21.540 align:start position:0%
olds
 
00:51:24.290 --> 00:51:24.300 align:start position:0%
and I think
 
00:51:27.530 --> 00:51:27.540 align:start position:0%
I think people can disagree have an
 
00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
honest debate on just exactly when a
 
00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
person becomes more adult than less
 
00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:33.230 align:start position:0%
person becomes more adult than less
adult

00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:33.240 align:start position:0%
adult
 
00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
and so you're opposed to this bill but
 
00:51:39.049 --> 00:51:39.059 align:start position:0%
if this bill were let's just say for 0
 
00:51:41.450 --> 00:51:41.460 align:start position:0%
to 12 year olds would you support it I
 
00:51:43.549 --> 00:51:43.559 align:start position:0%
mean is there any age where you finally
 
00:51:45.410 --> 00:51:45.420 align:start position:0%
say yeah you know what we need to
 
00:51:48.770 --> 00:51:48.780 align:start position:0%
support that or is 13 your limit or is
 
00:51:50.990 --> 00:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
there no limit that you know what I mean
 
00:51:52.490 --> 00:51:52.500 align:start position:0%
is there is there I mean we're dealing
 
00:51:54.349 --> 00:51:54.359 align:start position:0%
with just a specific set here but if
 
00:51:56.750 --> 00:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
we're talking 0 to 12 is that when you
 
00:51:58.849 --> 00:51:58.859 align:start position:0%
support the bill or I don't know I'm
 
00:52:00.470 --> 00:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
just curious where where your cutoff
 
00:52:02.990 --> 00:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
line is thank you I appreciate your
 
00:52:06.290 --> 00:52:06.300 align:start position:0%
question I I'm not sure I'm able to
 
00:52:07.849 --> 00:52:07.859 align:start position:0%
speak to the organization's viewpoint on
 
00:52:09.950 --> 00:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
that at this point look into it right
 
00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:11.450 align:start position:0%
that at this point look into it right
now

00:52:11.450 --> 00:52:11.460 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:52:16.010 --> 00:52:16.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:21.710 --> 00:52:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:23.630 --> 00:52:23.640 align:start position:0%
the last person signed up to testify
 
00:52:25.970 --> 00:52:25.980 align:start position:0%
this morning on this bill is uh Emma
 
00:52:38.990 --> 00:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:40.910 --> 00:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and members of the
 
00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Emma savini I am
 
00:52:44.990 --> 00:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
the children's Behavioral Health policy
 
00:52:46.849 --> 00:52:46.859 align:start position:0%
coordinator at new Futures new Futures
 
00:52:49.250 --> 00:52:49.260 align:start position:0%
is a nonpartisan non-profit advocacy
 
00:52:51.890 --> 00:52:51.900 align:start position:0%
organization that Advocates educates and
 
00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
collaborates for the great health and
 
00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
wellness of all Granite Staters
 
00:52:58.670 --> 00:52:58.680 align:start position:0%
we are here in opposition to House Bill
 
00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
406 and our position is very similar to
 
00:53:03.410 --> 00:53:03.420 align:start position:0%
nami's in the hospital associations
 
00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
um we in the first instance believe that
 
00:53:08.210 --> 00:53:08.220 align:start position:0%
this bill is unnecessary and could have
 
00:53:10.250 --> 00:53:10.260 align:start position:0%
a chilling effect on a child's
 
00:53:11.870 --> 00:53:11.880 align:start position:0%
relationship with their mental health
 
00:53:14.450 --> 00:53:14.460 align:start position:0%
provider which could impact treatment
 
00:53:18.170 --> 00:53:18.180 align:start position:0%
outcomes and cause children to avoid
 
00:53:21.290 --> 00:53:21.300 align:start position:0%
getting treatment early or avoid being
 
00:53:23.450 --> 00:53:23.460 align:start position:0%
fully honest with a provider in a way
 
00:53:25.069 --> 00:53:25.079 align:start position:0%
that would
 
00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
um you know have a chilling effect on
 
00:53:29.210 --> 00:53:29.220 align:start position:0%
their ability to receive uh proper and
 
00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
efficient treatment
 
00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:31.970 align:start position:0%
efficient treatment
um

00:53:31.970 --> 00:53:31.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:33.829 --> 00:53:33.839 align:start position:0%
as you heard wonderfully from
 
00:53:37.309 --> 00:53:37.319 align:start position:0%
representative kopal about the Berg
 
00:53:39.589 --> 00:53:39.599 align:start position:0%
decision that decision really emphasized
 
00:53:41.710 --> 00:53:41.720 align:start position:0%
the importance of having
 
00:53:44.329 --> 00:53:44.339 align:start position:0%
confidentiality in situ certain
 
00:53:46.430 --> 00:53:46.440 align:start position:0%
situations for mental health records for
 
00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:48.530 align:start position:0%
situations for mental health records for
minors

00:53:48.530 --> 00:53:48.540 align:start position:0%
minors
 
00:53:51.109 --> 00:53:51.119 align:start position:0%
um and so we just would ask in the first
 
00:53:53.630 --> 00:53:53.640 align:start position:0%
instance that this bill be voted itl and
 
00:53:55.309 --> 00:53:55.319 align:start position:0%
then in the second instance if you do
 
00:53:56.510 --> 00:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
believe that this bill needs to move
 
00:53:59.390 --> 00:53:59.400 align:start position:0%
forward have that carve out where it is
 
00:54:03.170 --> 00:54:03.180 align:start position:0%
changing that and on line nine to an or
 
00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
in an amendment and I'm happy to take
 
00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
any questions questions yes
 
00:54:09.410 --> 00:54:09.420 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
00:54:11.569 --> 00:54:11.579 align:start position:0%
this is a follow-up to a question that
 
00:54:13.730 --> 00:54:13.740 align:start position:0%
representative merchand asked earlier do
 
00:54:16.630 --> 00:54:16.640 align:start position:0%
you have any opinion about
 
00:54:20.210 --> 00:54:20.220 align:start position:0%
the effect of this bill on the ability
 
00:54:22.250 --> 00:54:22.260 align:start position:0%
of a court to order
 
00:54:24.609 --> 00:54:24.619 align:start position:0%
in either direction either order
 
00:54:27.549 --> 00:54:27.559 align:start position:0%
disclosure to a parent or order
 
00:54:30.109 --> 00:54:30.119 align:start position:0%
non-disclosure of
 
00:54:33.290 --> 00:54:33.300 align:start position:0%
a medical record yes
 
00:54:35.870 --> 00:54:35.880 align:start position:0%
um so I am an attorney but I have been
 
00:54:37.549 --> 00:54:37.559 align:start position:0%
out of practice for a little bit so I
 
00:54:38.870 --> 00:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
don't have the answer off the top of my
 
00:54:40.609 --> 00:54:40.619 align:start position:0%
head that I'm happy to get that for you
 
00:54:42.650 --> 00:54:42.660 align:start position:0%
if you could that would be very helpful
 
00:54:44.690 --> 00:54:44.700 align:start position:0%
to us absolutely thank you
 
00:54:46.790 --> 00:54:46.800 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
yes representative Nagel believe it or
 
00:54:51.549 --> 00:54:51.559 align:start position:0%
not I do have a question
 
00:54:54.530 --> 00:54:54.540 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:54:56.329 --> 00:54:56.339 align:start position:0%
um we focused a lot on mental health and
 
00:54:58.730 --> 00:54:58.740 align:start position:0%
I do understand that um on page 10 of
 
00:55:00.829 --> 00:55:00.839 align:start position:0%
the guide that we were handed it seems
 
00:55:04.069 --> 00:55:04.079 align:start position:0%
to be accepted from this bill is that
 
00:55:06.890 --> 00:55:06.900 align:start position:0%
your understanding or not so
 
00:55:08.870 --> 00:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry I left my bill the bill
 
00:55:10.309 --> 00:55:10.319 align:start position:0%
text it's not in the bill I'm sorry it's
 
00:55:12.829 --> 00:55:12.839 align:start position:0%
something you're right-handed so um I
 
00:55:14.329 --> 00:55:14.339 align:start position:0%
don't think mental health is necessarily
 
00:55:16.069 --> 00:55:16.079 align:start position:0%
accepted to the full extent it would be
 
00:55:18.349 --> 00:55:18.359 align:start position:0%
under current law this bill would be
 
00:55:20.750 --> 00:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
narrowing the scope of the ability for a
 
00:55:22.849 --> 00:55:22.859 align:start position:0%
provider to keep confidential records
 
00:55:24.829 --> 00:55:24.839 align:start position:0%
for mental health purposes
 
00:55:26.329 --> 00:55:26.339 align:start position:0%
um and that's why we were requesting
 
00:55:28.309 --> 00:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
that change from an aunt to an or to
 
00:55:30.349 --> 00:55:30.359 align:start position:0%
bring it more in line with the mature
 
00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:32.640 align:start position:0%
minor statue or mature minor standard
 
00:55:36.410 --> 00:55:36.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:38.930 --> 00:55:38.940 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:55:41.150 --> 00:55:41.160 align:start position:0%
representative palazzov
 
00:55:43.490 --> 00:55:43.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Chen thank you for taking
 
00:55:46.430 --> 00:55:46.440 align:start position:0%
my question uh I want to ask what
 
00:55:48.410 --> 00:55:48.420 align:start position:0%
percentage of
 
00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:51.200 align:start position:0%
your patients we are talking about
 
00:55:54.410 --> 00:55:54.420 align:start position:0%
obviously probably it's a significant
 
00:55:56.750 --> 00:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
one since
 
00:55:56.760 --> 00:55:57.290 align:start position:0%
one since
um

00:55:57.290 --> 00:55:57.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:00.650 --> 00:56:00.660 align:start position:0%
it's important for you to testify here
 
00:56:05.770 --> 00:56:05.780 align:start position:0%
is it like one percent of kids who seek
 
00:56:09.290 --> 00:56:09.300 align:start position:0%
mental health problems that you assess
 
00:56:11.870 --> 00:56:11.880 align:start position:0%
as antagonistic with parents and you
 
00:56:15.170 --> 00:56:15.180 align:start position:0%
don't want to release this record so is
 
00:56:17.930 --> 00:56:17.940 align:start position:0%
it like half of your clients what
 
00:56:20.329 --> 00:56:20.339 align:start position:0%
percentage just to clarify I am not a
 
00:56:22.609 --> 00:56:22.619 align:start position:0%
mental health provider I'm a policy
 
00:56:24.349 --> 00:56:24.359 align:start position:0%
coordinator with a with the non-profit
 
00:56:26.990 --> 00:56:27.000 align:start position:0%
so I don't actually give mental health
 
00:56:29.630 --> 00:56:29.640 align:start position:0%
treatment but I can absolutely try and
 
00:56:31.910 --> 00:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
find that statistic for you across New
 
00:56:33.770 --> 00:56:33.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm not sure it's necessarily
 
00:56:35.809 --> 00:56:35.819 align:start position:0%
exists but I'll look for it for you
 
00:56:37.549 --> 00:56:37.559 align:start position:0%
thank you very much yes representative
 
00:56:37.559 --> 00:56:38.630 align:start position:0%
thank you very much yes representative
McLean

00:56:38.630 --> 00:56:38.640 align:start position:0%
McLean
 
00:56:40.490 --> 00:56:40.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and and thank you for
 
00:56:43.130 --> 00:56:43.140 align:start position:0%
taking my question so um one of the
 
00:56:45.829 --> 00:56:45.839 align:start position:0%
things that this bill is sort of
 
00:56:47.390 --> 00:56:47.400 align:start position:0%
explicit about it from reading is the
 
00:56:49.790 --> 00:56:49.800 align:start position:0%
fact and we heard testimony to this that
 
00:56:52.010 --> 00:56:52.020 align:start position:0%
that HIPAA is still there and all the
 
00:56:54.109 --> 00:56:54.119 align:start position:0%
protection is given by HIPAA are still
 
00:56:57.890 --> 00:56:57.900 align:start position:0%
there so I think this is clarifying so
 
00:56:59.569 --> 00:56:59.579 align:start position:0%
can you can you think of an example
 
00:57:01.190 --> 00:57:01.200 align:start position:0%
because I don't have your experience
 
00:57:03.770 --> 00:57:03.780 align:start position:0%
where you might come across a situation
 
00:57:06.349 --> 00:57:06.359 align:start position:0%
where this might actually impede
 
00:57:08.030 --> 00:57:08.040 align:start position:0%
treatment can you think of a specific
 
00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:09.650 align:start position:0%
treatment can you think of a specific
case

00:57:09.650 --> 00:57:09.660 align:start position:0%
case
 
00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
um where this bill would impede
 
00:57:13.849 --> 00:57:13.859 align:start position:0%
treatment yes so
 
00:57:16.970 --> 00:57:16.980 align:start position:0%
um I think just in a situation where a
 
00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
minor is seeking treatment and maybe
 
00:57:21.470 --> 00:57:21.480 align:start position:0%
um you know discussing something that
 
00:57:23.930 --> 00:57:23.940 align:start position:0%
their parents may not necessarily know
 
00:57:26.089 --> 00:57:26.099 align:start position:0%
or agree about with and they're scared
 
00:57:27.650 --> 00:57:27.660 align:start position:0%
to discuss that with their parents but
 
00:57:28.970 --> 00:57:28.980 align:start position:0%
they're looking to their treatment
 
00:57:31.490 --> 00:57:31.500 align:start position:0%
mental health treatment provider to find
 
00:57:33.230 --> 00:57:33.240 align:start position:0%
a healthy way to discuss that with their
 
00:57:34.309 --> 00:57:34.319 align:start position:0%
parents a lot of times treatment
 
00:57:37.430 --> 00:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
providers as Mr Hawkins mentioned from
 
00:57:39.049 --> 00:57:39.059 align:start position:0%
Nami will try to bring in the parents
 
00:57:41.329 --> 00:57:41.339 align:start position:0%
when it's appropriate so a lot of times
 
00:57:42.950 --> 00:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
they'll work together but they are not
 
00:57:44.809 --> 00:57:44.819 align:start position:0%
ready to disclose something to a parent
 
00:57:46.309 --> 00:57:46.319 align:start position:0%
right away
 
00:57:50.150 --> 00:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
follow up and and that that kind of
 
00:57:53.089 --> 00:57:53.099 align:start position:0%
conversation is currently not protected
 
00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
by HIPAA but it is by state law as your
 
00:58:00.290 --> 00:58:00.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:02.630 --> 00:58:02.640 align:start position:0%
so my understanding is that in the event
 
00:58:05.870 --> 00:58:05.880 align:start position:0%
that a minor has approached their mental
 
00:58:07.490 --> 00:58:07.500 align:start position:0%
health provider and it's understood that
 
00:58:09.349 --> 00:58:09.359 align:start position:0%
the conversation is confidential under
 
00:58:11.930 --> 00:58:11.940 align:start position:0%
state law under HIPAA under
 
00:58:13.549 --> 00:58:13.559 align:start position:0%
um maybe a waiver of confidentiality
 
00:58:16.790 --> 00:58:16.800 align:start position:0%
then those medical records are protected
 
00:58:18.710 --> 00:58:18.720 align:start position:0%
from the parent until the minor decides
 
00:58:20.710 --> 00:58:20.720 align:start position:0%
to disclose them
 
00:58:22.609 --> 00:58:22.619 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman did you have your
 
00:58:23.750 --> 00:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
hand up earlier
 
00:58:25.730 --> 00:58:25.740 align:start position:0%
um and thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:58:27.589 --> 00:58:27.599 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh I'm thinking
 
00:58:29.329 --> 00:58:29.339 align:start position:0%
about you were speaking to the chilling
 
00:58:30.770 --> 00:58:30.780 align:start position:0%
effect that this might have on the
 
00:58:32.450 --> 00:58:32.460 align:start position:0%
ability to have those prank
 
00:58:34.549 --> 00:58:34.559 align:start position:0%
conversations with minors
 
00:58:36.230 --> 00:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
um do you see that there may be also a
 
00:58:38.329 --> 00:58:38.339 align:start position:0%
chilling effect on parents even bringing
 
00:58:40.670 --> 00:58:40.680 align:start position:0%
their their children to a therapist to
 
00:58:43.910 --> 00:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
seek treatment if they can't have you
 
00:58:46.490 --> 00:58:46.500 align:start position:0%
know reasonable information you know
 
00:58:48.710 --> 00:58:48.720 align:start position:0%
when they request it besides what's
 
00:58:51.950 --> 00:58:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:52.789 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:58:52.789 --> 00:58:52.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:54.710 --> 00:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
I could see it both ways and thank you
 
00:58:55.849 --> 00:58:55.859 align:start position:0%
for your question
 
00:58:58.849 --> 00:58:58.859 align:start position:0%
um I think that in most instances as
 
00:59:02.210 --> 00:59:02.220 align:start position:0%
have been has been mentioned parents are
 
00:59:04.010 --> 00:59:04.020 align:start position:0%
typically included in mental health
 
00:59:06.650 --> 00:59:06.660 align:start position:0%
treatment and are encouraged to be an
 
00:59:08.990 --> 00:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
active participant whether that's you
 
00:59:11.329 --> 00:59:11.339 align:start position:0%
know set limits with them coming into
 
00:59:13.130 --> 00:59:13.140 align:start position:0%
treatment or something
 
00:59:15.530 --> 00:59:15.540 align:start position:0%
um that's between the provider and the
 
00:59:17.630 --> 00:59:17.640 align:start position:0%
parent and the child
 
00:59:20.089 --> 00:59:20.099 align:start position:0%
um so I don't necessarily see that this
 
00:59:21.349 --> 00:59:21.359 align:start position:0%
would have as much of a chilling effect
 
00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
as it would on the child seeking
 
00:59:27.049 --> 00:59:27.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:29.990 --> 00:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:31.670 --> 00:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
saying no other questions
 
00:59:35.450 --> 00:59:35.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:37.789 --> 00:59:37.799 align:start position:0%
no one else has signed up to testify uh
 
00:59:40.789 --> 00:59:40.799 align:start position:0%
testify on House Bill 406 has anyone
 
00:59:43.250 --> 00:59:43.260 align:start position:0%

2000 and 2007.
 
01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
then things picked up
 
01:01:58.130 --> 01:01:58.140 align:start position:0%
and from 2007 to 2017
 
01:02:00.650 --> 01:02:00.660 align:start position:0%
the teen suicide rate spiked by nearly

01:04:16.970 --> 01:04:16.980 align:start position:0%
this bill will not will not solve all
 
01:04:20.630 --> 01:04:20.640 align:start position:0%
youth mental health issues however
 
01:04:24.650 --> 01:04:24.660 align:start position:0%
it will add another tool to our youth
 
01:04:27.549 --> 01:04:27.559 align:start position:0%
mental health toolbox
 
01:04:27.559 --> 01:04:29.450 align:start position:0%
mental health toolbox
when

01:04:29.450 --> 01:04:29.460 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:04:32.750 --> 01:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
after my testimony when I because I am
 
01:04:34.549 --> 01:04:34.559 align:start position:0%
going to have to leave after the
 
01:04:37.190 --> 01:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
testimony because my committee is in in
 
01:04:40.809 --> 01:04:40.819 align:start position:0%
session uh in an executive session
 
01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
however I will give your clerk that
 
01:04:48.650 --> 01:04:48.660 align:start position:0%
Trevor report a hard copy but I did give
 
01:04:52.930 --> 01:04:52.940 align:start position:0%
you a Google doc on it also the
 
01:04:55.490 --> 01:04:55.500 align:start position:0%
Nami research
 
01:04:57.890 --> 01:04:57.900 align:start position:0%
and the other part is there was a
 
01:04:59.210 --> 01:04:59.220 align:start position:0%
similar bill
 
01:04:59.220 --> 01:05:01.309 align:start position:0%
similar bill
uh

01:05:01.309 --> 01:05:01.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:05:05.410 --> 01:05:05.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:07.549 --> 01:05:07.559 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
01:05:14.390 --> 01:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:15.770 align:start position:0%
 
submitted

01:05:15.770 --> 01:05:15.780 align:start position:0%
submitted
 
01:05:18.109 --> 01:05:18.119 align:start position:0%
the data from the other states how they
 
01:05:20.170 --> 01:05:20.180 align:start position:0%
handle this issue
 
01:05:23.870 --> 01:05:23.880 align:start position:0%
so you should all have that but I will
 
01:05:27.049 --> 01:05:27.059 align:start position:0%
give a a hard copy to the to the clerk
 
01:05:29.210 --> 01:05:29.220 align:start position:0%
and thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:05:31.130 --> 01:05:31.140 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for taking
 
01:05:34.609 --> 01:05:34.619 align:start position:0%
my testimon and I'll take questions okay
 
01:05:38.930 --> 01:05:38.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:40.970 --> 01:05:40.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:05:42.890 --> 01:05:42.900 align:start position:0%
um and thank you representative Bouchard
 
01:05:45.710 --> 01:05:45.720 align:start position:0%
would you believe that this bill
 
01:05:49.069 --> 01:05:49.079 align:start position:0%
might actually clarify and actually
 
01:05:51.530 --> 01:05:51.540 align:start position:0%
limit the age at which people were able
 
01:05:53.809 --> 01:05:53.819 align:start position:0%
to seek treatment
 
01:05:53.819 --> 01:05:57.430 align:start position:0%
to seek treatment
um

01:05:57.430 --> 01:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:00.589 --> 01:06:00.599 align:start position:0%
rather than create a new right if we
 
01:06:02.990 --> 01:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
refer to um
 
01:06:11.270 --> 01:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
Miss Dyer's research on RSA 135 C12 it
 
01:06:14.030 --> 01:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
refers to the fact that any person
 
01:06:17.470 --> 01:06:17.480 align:start position:0%
without giving an age can
 
01:06:21.230 --> 01:06:21.240 align:start position:0%
can apply for treatment mental health
 
01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:22.549 align:start position:0%
can apply for treatment mental health
treatment

01:06:22.549 --> 01:06:22.559 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
01:06:22.559 --> 01:06:24.710 align:start position:0%
treatment
so

01:06:24.710 --> 01:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:06:27.109 --> 01:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
this would you believe that this might
 
01:06:29.569 --> 01:06:29.579 align:start position:0%
actually limit the age from to 16 and
 
01:06:31.789 --> 01:06:31.799 align:start position:0%
above and clarify a situation that's
 
01:06:31.799 --> 01:06:33.529 align:start position:0%
above and clarify a situation that's
really

01:06:33.529 --> 01:06:33.539 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:06:35.029 --> 01:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
um unclear
 
01:06:37.370 --> 01:06:37.380 align:start position:0%
and furthermore would you believe that
 
01:06:38.690 --> 01:06:38.700 align:start position:0%
when I tried to find out information
 
01:06:40.730 --> 01:06:40.740 align:start position:0%
about this
 
01:06:40.740 --> 01:06:41.750 align:start position:0%
about this
um

01:06:41.750 --> 01:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:43.789 --> 01:06:43.799 align:start position:0%
in the in the past few years because
 
01:06:45.589 --> 01:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
other bills have come up when I called
 
01:06:47.510 --> 01:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
my Community Mental Health Center and
 
01:06:50.029 --> 01:06:50.039 align:start position:0%
spoke to the CEO and I said what would
 
01:06:54.829 --> 01:06:54.839 align:start position:0%
you do if a 17 year old in distress came
 
01:06:57.470 --> 01:06:57.480 align:start position:0%
to seek mental health services without
 
01:06:59.930 --> 01:06:59.940 align:start position:0%
the consent of their parents that they
 
01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:00.829 align:start position:0%
the consent of their parents that they
said

01:07:00.829 --> 01:07:00.839 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:07:03.109 --> 01:07:03.119 align:start position:0%
we would call our attorney because they
 
01:07:05.510 --> 01:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
didn't know what to do so that this
 
01:07:07.370 --> 01:07:07.380 align:start position:0%
would so would you believe that this
 
01:07:09.049 --> 01:07:09.059 align:start position:0%
would actually clarify a situation
 
01:07:11.750 --> 01:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
that's very unclear presently
 
01:07:13.730 --> 01:07:13.740 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question and no I
 
01:07:14.750 --> 01:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
did not
 
01:07:16.370 --> 01:07:16.380 align:start position:0%
but that's
 
01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:17.690 align:start position:0%
but that's
that's great

01:07:17.690 --> 01:07:17.700 align:start position:0%
that's great
 
01:07:20.510 --> 01:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
and representative Leon uh thank you Mr
 
01:07:21.890 --> 01:07:21.900 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you representative
 
01:07:24.049 --> 01:07:24.059 align:start position:0%
for bringing this bill to us
 
01:07:26.329 --> 01:07:26.339 align:start position:0%
um I recognize that there is a lot of
 
01:07:28.309 --> 01:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
need to be able to go to somebody and
 
01:07:30.309 --> 01:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
speak I'm curious if you would support
 
01:07:32.270 --> 01:07:32.280 align:start position:0%
limiting this to non-directive
 
01:07:34.309 --> 01:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
counseling where you'd be in an
 
01:07:36.349 --> 01:07:36.359 align:start position:0%
encouraging atmosphere but not offering
 
01:07:38.870 --> 01:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
advice interpretation or action to
 
01:07:41.089 --> 01:07:41.099 align:start position:0%
direct the therapeutic process so that
 
01:07:43.190 --> 01:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
these children can go into a safe
 
01:07:45.650 --> 01:07:45.660 align:start position:0%
sounding area with a professional but
 
01:07:49.309 --> 01:07:49.319 align:start position:0%
not necessarily be guided to any obvious
 
01:07:51.470 --> 01:07:51.480 align:start position:0%
now obviously you're going to be guided
 
01:07:52.870 --> 01:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
against suicide
 
01:07:55.190 --> 01:07:55.200 align:start position:0%
because you're because that's one of
 
01:07:57.710 --> 01:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
those issues but to not not end up in
 
01:07:59.750 --> 01:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
any sort of guided therapy but just have
 
01:08:02.569 --> 01:08:02.579 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to speak freely and
 
01:08:04.549 --> 01:08:04.559 align:start position:0%
address their issues
 
01:08:07.430 --> 01:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
now uh thank you for the question now
 
01:08:09.349 --> 01:08:09.359 align:start position:0%
I'm not clear if I understand the
 
01:08:14.270 --> 01:08:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
I I understand it please please do do
 
01:08:20.689 --> 01:08:20.699 align:start position:0%
you intend for this to include any sort
 
01:08:23.090 --> 01:08:23.100 align:start position:0%
of therapy where it goes into a specific
 
01:08:27.050 --> 01:08:27.060 align:start position:0%
intention somebody sent coming in or do
 
01:08:28.309 --> 01:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
you intend that it just provides an
 
01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity for somebody to go talk with
 
01:08:33.229 --> 01:08:33.239 align:start position:0%
a professional I'm just the the only
 
01:08:34.849 --> 01:08:34.859 align:start position:0%
purpose of the bill is to give the
 
01:08:37.490 --> 01:08:37.500 align:start position:0%
opportunity and that's it nothing else
 
01:08:41.150 --> 01:08:41.160 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions
 
01:08:46.070 --> 01:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:47.450 --> 01:08:47.460 align:start position:0%
would you believe representative
 
01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
Bouchard that I've just had a fairly
 
01:08:52.130 --> 01:08:52.140 align:start position:0%

01:09:09.169 --> 01:09:09.179 align:start position:0%
um we understand you have other
 
01:09:11.450 --> 01:09:11.460 align:start position:0%
responsibilities but are there any other
 
01:09:13.610 --> 01:09:13.620 align:start position:0%

um minors and then in the long term as
 
01:10:25.260 --> 01:10:26.510 align:start position:0%
um minors and then in the long term as
well

01:10:26.510 --> 01:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
um when a minor is exhibiting symptoms
 
01:10:32.709 --> 01:10:32.719 align:start position:0%
of a mental health uh challenge early
 
01:10:35.570 --> 01:10:35.580 align:start position:0%
interventions are most effective and
 
01:10:35.580 --> 01:10:36.649 align:start position:0%
interventions are most effective and
most

01:10:36.649 --> 01:10:36.659 align:start position:0%
most
 
01:10:39.169 --> 01:10:39.179 align:start position:0%
um offer the best benefit for treatment
 
01:10:42.050 --> 01:10:42.060 align:start position:0%
outcomes especially long term
 
01:10:44.990 --> 01:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
if conditions are left untreated not
 
01:10:47.390 --> 01:10:47.400 align:start position:0%
only is it detrimental to a child's
 
01:10:48.970 --> 01:10:48.980 align:start position:0%
ability to
 
01:10:51.010 --> 01:10:51.020 align:start position:0%
successfully participate in school
 
01:10:53.450 --> 01:10:53.460 align:start position:0%
extracurricular Sports it will have
 
01:10:56.570 --> 01:10:56.580 align:start position:0%
long-term negative effects for most of
 
01:10:59.330 --> 01:10:59.340 align:start position:0%
their lives if not all of it allowing a
 
01:11:01.010 --> 01:11:01.020 align:start position:0%
minor the ability to seek mental health
 
01:11:02.930 --> 01:11:02.940 align:start position:0%
treatment when they need it without
 
01:11:05.450 --> 01:11:05.460 align:start position:0%
necessarily needing to get a parental
 
01:11:05.460 --> 01:11:06.430 align:start position:0%
necessarily needing to get a parental
consent

01:11:06.430 --> 01:11:06.440 align:start position:0%
consent
 
01:11:08.630 --> 01:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
we'll give those children the
 
01:11:11.450 --> 01:11:11.460 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get treatment early and
 
01:11:11.460 --> 01:11:13.970 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get treatment early and
effectively

01:11:13.970 --> 01:11:13.980 align:start position:0%
effectively
 
01:11:16.490 --> 01:11:16.500 align:start position:0%
um as you heard at the last hearing it's
 
01:11:20.330 --> 01:11:20.340 align:start position:0%
typical and most practitioners of mental
 
01:11:22.130 --> 01:11:22.140 align:start position:0%
health treatment encourage parent
 
01:11:24.110 --> 01:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
involvement so if a minor comes to them
 
01:11:27.169 --> 01:11:27.179 align:start position:0%
without parental consent initially they
 
01:11:29.450 --> 01:11:29.460 align:start position:0%
will likely encourage that child to
 
01:11:31.430 --> 01:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
eventually Loop in the parent and
 
01:11:34.850 --> 01:11:34.860 align:start position:0%
encourage a an open and honest lines of
 
01:11:36.530 --> 01:11:36.540 align:start position:0%
communication between the child child
 
01:11:39.950 --> 01:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:42.410 --> 01:11:42.420 align:start position:0%
um for those reasons new Futures urges
 
01:11:44.390 --> 01:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
this committee to vote ought to pass on
 
01:11:45.950 --> 01:11:45.960 align:start position:0%
this bill and I'm happy to take any
 
01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:47.030 align:start position:0%
this bill and I'm happy to take any
questions

01:11:47.030 --> 01:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:11:49.610 --> 01:11:49.620 align:start position:0%
thank you questions yes representative
 
01:11:52.669 --> 01:11:52.679 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you I was interested in
 
01:11:54.709 --> 01:11:54.719 align:start position:0%
exploring representative Shapiro's
 
01:11:57.229 --> 01:11:57.239 align:start position:0%
question a little bit more
 
01:11:57.239 --> 01:11:59.090 align:start position:0%
question a little bit more
um

01:11:59.090 --> 01:11:59.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:03.649 --> 01:12:03.659 align:start position:0%
and I am wondering if
 
01:12:06.530 --> 01:12:06.540 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering now if we pass this are we
 
01:12:09.050 --> 01:12:09.060 align:start position:0%
perhaps for closing
 
01:12:11.229 --> 01:12:11.239 align:start position:0%
the option
 
01:12:14.570 --> 01:12:14.580 align:start position:0%
or a younger
 
01:12:17.030 --> 01:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
but mature
 
01:12:19.370 --> 01:12:19.380 align:start position:0%
person seeking
 
01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
counseling or guidance
 
01:12:25.189 --> 01:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
um I think I absolutely thank you for
 
01:12:26.090 --> 01:12:26.100 align:start position:0%
your question
 
01:12:28.070 --> 01:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
um rep Shapiro is definitely more of an
 
01:12:30.110 --> 01:12:30.120 align:start position:0%
expert on Mental Health practice day to
 
01:12:32.570 --> 01:12:32.580 align:start position:0%
day so I would have to do a little more
 
01:12:34.729 --> 01:12:34.739 align:start position:0%
digging to determine exactly what the
 
01:12:36.649 --> 01:12:36.659 align:start position:0%
current practice is
 
01:12:38.709 --> 01:12:38.719 align:start position:0%
um and get you a more clear answer
 
01:12:41.930 --> 01:12:41.940 align:start position:0%
for that so I'll get back to you
 
01:12:45.290 --> 01:12:45.300 align:start position:0%
representative McLean
 
01:12:46.790 --> 01:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:12:49.490 --> 01:12:49.500 align:start position:0%
taking my question so um we got this
 
01:12:51.770 --> 01:12:51.780 align:start position:0%
awesome Memo from Christina Dyer which I
 
01:12:53.450 --> 01:12:53.460 align:start position:0%
have not had an opportunity to fully
 
01:12:56.270 --> 01:12:56.280 align:start position:0%
digest but it it states in the summary
 
01:12:58.550 --> 01:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
section that a New Hampshire law
 
01:13:00.709 --> 01:13:00.719 align:start position:0%
provides that any person can apply for
 
01:13:02.450 --> 01:13:02.460 align:start position:0%
mental health services but it doesn't
 
01:13:04.550 --> 01:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
specifically address the applicability
 
01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
to minors so I guess my question is is
 
01:13:10.130 --> 01:13:10.140 align:start position:0%
it needed or is it not needed so are you
 
01:13:12.229 --> 01:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
aware has anybody come to you at new
 
01:13:14.689 --> 01:13:14.699 align:start position:0%
Futures and says listen you know we're
 
01:13:18.169 --> 01:13:18.179 align:start position:0%
looking for care we want to talk to
 
01:13:20.810 --> 01:13:20.820 align:start position:0%
somebody but we have been expressly
 
01:13:23.630 --> 01:13:23.640 align:start position:0%
denied that opportunity because of our
 
01:13:25.550 --> 01:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
age as do you have any experience with
 
01:13:28.610 --> 01:13:28.620 align:start position:0%
that so I haven't but I'm also not the
 
01:13:30.290 --> 01:13:30.300 align:start position:0%
best person people would likely reach
 
01:13:31.970 --> 01:13:31.980 align:start position:0%
out to on that issue just because we
 
01:13:34.910 --> 01:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
don't provide direct service to folks so
 
01:13:36.530 --> 01:13:36.540 align:start position:0%
um while I do know a lot of the services
 
01:13:38.030 --> 01:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
that are available and I'm happy to
 
01:13:40.189 --> 01:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
provide information to people who call
 
01:13:41.510 --> 01:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
um typically they go to direct service
 
01:13:43.010 --> 01:13:43.020 align:start position:0%
providers with those types of questions
 
01:13:44.930 --> 01:13:44.940 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
01:13:48.050 --> 01:13:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:49.970 --> 01:13:49.980 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you Mr
 
01:13:52.370 --> 01:13:52.380 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for being here my
 
01:13:54.709 --> 01:13:54.719 align:start position:0%
question is similar to before would new
 
01:13:56.209 --> 01:13:56.219 align:start position:0%
Futures support doing this for
 
01:13:58.550 --> 01:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
non-directive counseling where it's just
 
01:14:00.950 --> 01:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
limited to when they um when when the
 
01:14:03.050 --> 01:14:03.060 align:start position:0%
minor is trying to get the handle on
 
01:14:04.910 --> 01:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
what's going on and if anything becomes
 
01:14:06.590 --> 01:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
more engaged that the parents would get
 
01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:09.169 align:start position:0%
more engaged that the parents would get
involved

01:14:09.169 --> 01:14:09.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:10.970 --> 01:14:10.980 align:start position:0%
um I would have to do a little bit more
 
01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
research before I could get you a firm
 
01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
answer on that okay thank you
 
01:14:17.870 --> 01:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:19.490 --> 01:14:19.500 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:14:22.490 --> 01:14:22.500 align:start position:0%
uh representative Merchant
 
01:14:23.990 --> 01:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for the
 
01:14:25.729 --> 01:14:25.739 align:start position:0%
question I wanted to follow up on
 
01:14:28.689 --> 01:14:28.699 align:start position:0%
representative Weber's comment about the
 
01:14:32.450 --> 01:14:32.460 align:start position:0%
downside if we put 16 in there
 
01:14:35.209 --> 01:14:35.219 align:start position:0%
currently says any person could you by
 
01:14:37.910 --> 01:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
any chance would you be willing to
 
01:14:39.830 --> 01:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
survey the providers out there and find
 
01:14:42.050 --> 01:14:42.060 align:start position:0%
out in their opinion it's just going to
 
01:14:44.990 --> 01:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
become a problem for children or minors
 
01:14:47.630 --> 01:14:47.640 align:start position:0%
if you will under the age of 16. if it's
 
01:14:49.550 --> 01:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
only one percent is different but if
 
01:14:51.649 --> 01:14:51.659 align:start position:0%
they're running into real concerns about
 
01:14:53.810 --> 01:14:53.820 align:start position:0%
making the age limit at 12 having some
 
01:14:56.149 --> 01:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
any person to 16. it does provide
 
01:14:59.149 --> 01:14:59.159 align:start position:0%
Clarity but also the same time it does
 
01:15:02.570 --> 01:15:02.580 align:start position:0%
sort of limit it to anybody below 16.
 
01:15:05.209 --> 01:15:05.219 align:start position:0%
yeah absolutely I um would share that
 
01:15:07.310 --> 01:15:07.320 align:start position:0%
concern if we're precluding minors from
 
01:15:08.630 --> 01:15:08.640 align:start position:0%
getting mental health treatment so I'm
 
01:15:09.890 --> 01:15:09.900 align:start position:0%
happy to
 
01:15:11.689 --> 01:15:11.699 align:start position:0%
um as I said do some digging and try and
 
01:15:14.930 --> 01:15:14.940 align:start position:0%
get some more clarity on that
 
01:15:16.310 --> 01:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
representative Weber did you have your
 
01:15:18.770 --> 01:15:18.780 align:start position:0%
hand up I did but I think I've
 
01:15:22.790 --> 01:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
oh all set other questions
 
01:15:24.350 --> 01:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
representative King
 
01:15:26.090 --> 01:15:26.100 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman McDonald thank you
 
01:15:27.890 --> 01:15:27.900 align:start position:0%
for taking questions
 
01:15:31.729 --> 01:15:31.739 align:start position:0%
when I was 16 and 17 if I had you know
 
01:15:33.290 --> 01:15:33.300 align:start position:0%
mental health problems and I needed to
 
01:15:35.090 --> 01:15:35.100 align:start position:0%
go somewhere I have no idea where I
 
01:15:36.169 --> 01:15:36.179 align:start position:0%
would have gone maybe the school
 
01:15:38.990 --> 01:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
counselor or something like that
 
01:15:42.050 --> 01:15:42.060 align:start position:0%
um assuming this were law where would a
 
01:15:45.470 --> 01:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
16 or 17 year old go today to get mental
 
01:15:47.330 --> 01:15:47.340 align:start position:0%
health treatment and
 
01:15:49.729 --> 01:15:49.739 align:start position:0%
please list as many places that you know
 
01:15:52.610 --> 01:15:52.620 align:start position:0%
of do the 16 and 17 year olds know of
 
01:15:54.830 --> 01:15:54.840 align:start position:0%
these places and does this also include
 
01:15:57.590 --> 01:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
Telehealth thank you
 
01:16:00.830 --> 01:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
um I am not 16 or 17 and I think that
 
01:16:03.290 --> 01:16:03.300 align:start position:0%
was maybe a compliment but I'm not
 
01:16:04.790 --> 01:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
entirely sure
 
01:16:06.470 --> 01:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
um what is going on in the minds of the
 
01:16:08.689 --> 01:16:08.699 align:start position:0%
16 and 17 year olds I think similar to
 
01:16:13.250 --> 01:16:13.260 align:start position:0%
you they'll reach out to the closest uh
 
01:16:15.290 --> 01:16:15.300 align:start position:0%
person they have so maybe somebody at
 
01:16:16.669 --> 01:16:16.679 align:start position:0%
the school
 
01:16:18.709 --> 01:16:18.719 align:start position:0%
um maybe you know a friend has a
 
01:16:20.330 --> 01:16:20.340 align:start position:0%
recommendation of a counselor they've
 
01:16:23.270 --> 01:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
been seeing I know there are vast number
 
01:16:25.090 --> 01:16:25.100 align:start position:0%
of resources out there I could list
 
01:16:27.590 --> 01:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
dozens I don't know of 16 and 17 year
 
01:16:29.630 --> 01:16:29.640 align:start position:0%
olds are aware of them of mental health
 
01:16:31.250 --> 01:16:31.260 align:start position:0%
providers and communities community
 
01:16:33.709 --> 01:16:33.719 align:start position:0%
behavioral health centers Telehealth
 
01:16:35.630 --> 01:16:35.640 align:start position:0%
offerings those types of things
 
01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:36.709 align:start position:0%
offerings those types of things
um

01:16:36.709 --> 01:16:36.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:39.729 --> 01:16:39.739 align:start position:0%
so I don't know what they're necessarily
 
01:16:42.290 --> 01:16:42.300 align:start position:0%
in tune with what the what the kids are
 
01:16:45.290 --> 01:16:45.300 align:start position:0%
doing these days but um I'm sure that
 
01:16:46.970 --> 01:16:46.980 align:start position:0%
they would be able to reach out to a
 
01:16:51.169 --> 01:16:51.179 align:start position:0%
trusted adult and get reliable resources
 
01:16:53.390 --> 01:16:53.400 align:start position:0%
um through either their school a coach
 
01:16:56.209 --> 01:16:56.219 align:start position:0%
somebody like that
 
01:16:57.890 --> 01:16:57.900 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative
 
01:16:57.900 --> 01:16:59.510 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative
Palazzo

01:16:59.510 --> 01:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
Palazzo
 
01:17:01.669 --> 01:17:01.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Chen thank you for taking
 
01:17:04.729 --> 01:17:04.739 align:start position:0%
my question what's your understanding of
 
01:17:06.310 --> 01:17:06.320 align:start position:0%
the scope of
 
01:17:10.189 --> 01:17:10.199 align:start position:0%
mental health practice as I discovered
 
01:17:14.810 --> 01:17:14.820 align:start position:0%
here would it include some medications
 
01:17:18.850 --> 01:17:18.860 align:start position:0%
with possible side effects like
 
01:17:18.860 --> 01:17:20.709 align:start position:0%
with possible side effects like
antidepressants

01:17:20.709 --> 01:17:20.719 align:start position:0%
antidepressants
 
01:17:24.229 --> 01:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
or would it possibly include in the
 
01:17:24.239 --> 01:17:25.090 align:start position:0%
or would it possibly include in the
future

01:17:25.090 --> 01:17:25.100 align:start position:0%
future
 
01:17:29.890 --> 01:17:29.900 align:start position:0%
like medical marijuana for different
 
01:17:29.900 --> 01:17:31.810 align:start position:0%
like medical marijuana for different
anxieties

01:17:31.810 --> 01:17:31.820 align:start position:0%
anxieties
 
01:17:35.990 --> 01:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
or is it simply a
 
01:17:39.110 --> 01:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
um non non-pharmaceutical
 
01:17:41.930 --> 01:17:41.940 align:start position:0%
so um again I left my bill back at my
 
01:17:44.810 --> 01:17:44.820 align:start position:0%
seat but I believe it requires that um a
 
01:17:47.270 --> 01:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
parental involvement if medication is on
 
01:17:49.010 --> 01:17:49.020 align:start position:0%
the table to be discussed the bill the
 
01:17:52.610 --> 01:17:52.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:55.010 --> 01:17:55.020 align:start position:0%
IST and that would include I assume any
 
01:17:58.189 --> 01:17:58.199 align:start position:0%

01:18:00.590 --> 01:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel thank you Mr
 
01:18:02.330 --> 01:18:02.340 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks for taking my question
 
01:18:04.970 --> 01:18:04.980 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm just a question about current
 
01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
state law and how this will address that
 
01:18:09.110 --> 01:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
but use the word trusted adult
 
01:18:11.090 --> 01:18:11.100 align:start position:0%
see a lot of kids that are brought in by
 
01:18:12.890 --> 01:18:12.900 align:start position:0%
somebody other than their parent for
 
01:18:14.689 --> 01:18:14.699 align:start position:0%
very specific reasons what is the
 
01:18:16.189 --> 01:18:16.199 align:start position:0%
current law and how does this affect
 
01:18:19.010 --> 01:18:19.020 align:start position:0%
that is about the ability of a trusted
 
01:18:19.020 --> 01:18:20.090 align:start position:0%
that is about the ability of a trusted
adult

01:18:20.090 --> 01:18:20.100 align:start position:0%
adult
 
01:18:20.100 --> 01:18:22.550 align:start position:0%
adult
um to

01:18:22.550 --> 01:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
um to
 
01:18:25.610 --> 01:18:25.620 align:start position:0%
give consent or whatever so um I don't
 
01:18:27.470 --> 01:18:27.480 align:start position:0%
think a trusted adult is able to give
 
01:18:30.530 --> 01:18:30.540 align:start position:0%
consent on behalf of a minor if the
 
01:18:32.090 --> 01:18:32.100 align:start position:0%
minor is able to give consent on their
 
01:18:33.410 --> 01:18:33.420 align:start position:0%
own behalf they're able to receive
 
01:18:35.630 --> 01:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
treatment if it's a medical procedure in
 
01:18:37.430 --> 01:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
which a parent needs to give or a
 
01:18:38.810 --> 01:18:38.820 align:start position:0%
guardian needs to give consent they
 
01:18:40.910 --> 01:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
would have to give consent I don't think
 
01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
there's any law that allows just you
 
01:18:44.750 --> 01:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
know a trusted family friend to give
 
01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:48.010 align:start position:0%
know a trusted family friend to give
consent

01:18:48.010 --> 01:18:48.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:53.390 --> 01:18:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:56.209 --> 01:18:56.219 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:18:58.130 --> 01:18:58.140 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
01:18:58.140 --> 01:19:01.790 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
you

01:19:01.790 --> 01:19:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Sam Hawkins
 
01:19:20.090 --> 01:19:20.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
thank you again for the opportunity to

01:19:25.189 --> 01:19:25.199 align:start position:0%
uh my name is Sam Hawkins I'm the public
 
01:19:26.770 --> 01:19:26.780 align:start position:0%
policy assistant in Nami New Hampshire
 
01:19:29.570 --> 01:19:29.580 align:start position:0%
here today on behalf of Nami to speak in
 
01:19:31.790 --> 01:19:31.800 align:start position:0%
support of hb114
 
01:19:33.649 --> 01:19:33.659 align:start position:0%
. so over the past decade already high
 
01:19:35.270 --> 01:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
suicide rates have been rising in the
 
01:19:36.830 --> 01:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
new in the United States and New
 
01:19:38.630 --> 01:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire according to health Affairs
 
01:19:42.130 --> 01:19:42.140 align:start position:0%
between 2007 and 2018 suicide increased
 
01:19:45.709 --> 01:19:45.719 align:start position:0%
57.4 percent in 10 to 24 year olds in
 
01:19:47.270 --> 01:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
one survey of high school students one
 
01:19:48.890 --> 01:19:48.900 align:start position:0%
in three youth reported persistent
 
01:19:50.990 --> 01:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
feelings of sadness or hopelessness and
 
01:19:52.610 --> 01:19:52.620 align:start position:0%
one in five had seriously considered
 
01:19:52.620 --> 01:19:53.870 align:start position:0%
one in five had seriously considered
suicide

01:19:53.870 --> 01:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
suicide
 
01:19:56.750 --> 01:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
more precisely 2019 New Hampshire data
 
01:19:58.790 --> 01:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
indicated that 18.8 percent of high
 
01:20:00.229 --> 01:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
school students seriously considered
 
01:20:03.470 --> 01:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
suicide and 8.9 percent attempted it in
 
01:20:05.149 --> 01:20:05.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire suicide is the second
 
01:20:06.770 --> 01:20:06.780 align:start position:0%
leading cause of death for individuals
 
01:20:08.750 --> 01:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
ages 10 to 24.
 
01:20:10.370 --> 01:20:10.380 align:start position:0%
we need to look at new ways to address
 
01:20:12.050 --> 01:20:12.060 align:start position:0%
our youth Mental Health crisis and
 
01:20:13.850 --> 01:20:13.860 align:start position:0%
reduce barriers to care
 
01:20:16.250 --> 01:20:16.260 align:start position:0%
this bill is one important measure in
 
01:20:17.630 --> 01:20:17.640 align:start position:0%
doing so
 
01:20:19.850 --> 01:20:19.860 align:start position:0%
many factors impact an individual's
 
01:20:21.169 --> 01:20:21.179 align:start position:0%
willingness to seek care for their
 
01:20:22.910 --> 01:20:22.920 align:start position:0%
mental health concerns over personal
 
01:20:25.189 --> 01:20:25.199 align:start position:0%
privacy social stigma and the fear of
 
01:20:26.810 --> 01:20:26.820 align:start position:0%
rejection have the potential to leave
 
01:20:28.729 --> 01:20:28.739 align:start position:0%
someone struggling alone and in silence
 
01:20:30.890 --> 01:20:30.900 align:start position:0%
for teenagers these possible
 
01:20:32.510 --> 01:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
consequences can seem even more
 
01:20:34.430 --> 01:20:34.440 align:start position:0%
intimidating and without care their
 
01:20:35.930 --> 01:20:35.940 align:start position:0%
mental well-being will likely continue
 
01:20:38.930 --> 01:20:38.940 align:start position:0%
to decline towards crisis
 
01:20:41.270 --> 01:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor already spoke to uh
 
01:20:43.970 --> 01:20:43.980 align:start position:0%
the statistics for lgbtq individuals but
 
01:20:45.770 --> 01:20:45.780 align:start position:0%
I'll just quickly restate that within
 
01:20:48.110 --> 01:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
that population 52 percent wanted mental
 
01:20:49.669 --> 01:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
health care but were not able to receive
 
01:20:52.910 --> 01:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
it and of those 37 reported that this
 
01:20:54.410 --> 01:20:54.420 align:start position:0%
was due to not wanting to have to get
 
01:20:56.990 --> 01:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
their parent or caregivers permission
 
01:20:59.330 --> 01:20:59.340 align:start position:0%
again we do believe that familial
 
01:21:01.070 --> 01:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
support and involvement can make a huge
 
01:21:04.010 --> 01:21:04.020 align:start position:0%
positive impact on treatment and our
 
01:21:05.990 --> 01:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
experienced providers will focus on
 
01:21:07.550 --> 01:21:07.560 align:start position:0%
helping a child get to a point where
 
01:21:08.870 --> 01:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
they feel comfortable reaching out to
 
01:21:10.850 --> 01:21:10.860 align:start position:0%
their parent or Guardian but for those
 
01:21:12.470 --> 01:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
miners who who would be unsafe
 
01:21:14.810 --> 01:21:14.820 align:start position:0%
disclosing their condition or just feel
 
01:21:16.490 --> 01:21:16.500 align:start position:0%
more comfortable talking out the initial
 
01:21:17.990 --> 01:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
steps towards treatment private
 
01:21:19.910 --> 01:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
privately access to care without
 
01:21:22.250 --> 01:21:22.260 align:start position:0%
parental consent is crucial and could be
 
01:21:23.870 --> 01:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
potentially life-saving
 
01:21:25.910 --> 01:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
for these reasons Nami New Hampshire
 
01:21:27.169 --> 01:21:27.179 align:start position:0%
urges the committee to recommend ought
 
01:21:29.510 --> 01:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
to pass for hb-114
 
01:21:33.669 --> 01:21:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:36.110 --> 01:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
representative McLean
 
01:21:37.550 --> 01:21:37.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:21:39.950 --> 01:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm really looking at
 
01:21:42.950 --> 01:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
this 37 number
 
01:21:44.630 --> 01:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
um and that's a that's a that's a pretty
 
01:21:46.550 --> 01:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
big number so I just kind of want to
 
01:21:48.649 --> 01:21:48.659 align:start position:0%
understand that a little bit
 
01:21:53.090 --> 01:21:53.100 align:start position:0%
um was that 37 people that didn't even
 
01:21:55.790 --> 01:21:55.800 align:start position:0%
ask because they thought they would not
 
01:21:59.270 --> 01:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
get it or is it 37 that they had
 
01:22:00.950 --> 01:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
actually sought those services and they
 
01:22:03.890 --> 01:22:03.900 align:start position:0%
said no you're too young and we cannot
 
01:22:05.810 --> 01:22:05.820 align:start position:0%
give it to you without the parental
 
01:22:07.790 --> 01:22:07.800 align:start position:0%
consent was it a perception or was it a
 
01:22:09.950 --> 01:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
reality is I guess my question all right
 
01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question so yes it's
 
01:22:14.450 --> 01:22:14.460 align:start position:0%
that that 52 of lgbtq individuals and
 
01:22:16.790 --> 01:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
then within the report breaks it down uh
 
01:22:19.790 --> 01:22:19.800 align:start position:0%
reasons why they they did not seek or
 
01:22:21.410 --> 01:22:21.420 align:start position:0%
did not get treatment I believe the
 
01:22:22.850 --> 01:22:22.860 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor said he'd be getting you
 
01:22:25.970 --> 01:22:25.980 align:start position:0%
that report this was one of those items
 
01:22:30.050 --> 01:22:30.060 align:start position:0%
um and that is 37 of that 52 uh I do
 
01:22:32.390 --> 01:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
believe this specific Factor would just
 
01:22:34.070 --> 01:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
include them not even trying to seek
 
01:22:36.530 --> 01:22:36.540 align:start position:0%
treatment but I'm not sure sure about
 
01:22:38.090 --> 01:22:38.100 align:start position:0%
the other factors yeah
 
01:22:42.110 --> 01:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you Mr chair so again to
 
01:22:43.970 --> 01:22:43.980 align:start position:0%
kind of follow on representative Weber's
 
01:22:45.830 --> 01:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
and representative Merchants questions I
 
01:22:49.189 --> 01:22:49.199 align:start position:0%
don't want to kind of cut stuff off so
 
01:22:53.870 --> 01:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
um are you aware of situations where
 
01:22:58.070 --> 01:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
service was actively denied because of
 
01:23:00.590 --> 01:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
someone's age because it's not explicit
 
01:23:02.030 --> 01:23:02.040 align:start position:0%
in current law
 
01:23:04.370 --> 01:23:04.380 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not currently aware of any
 
01:23:07.610 --> 01:23:07.620 align:start position:0%
specific situations but that's uh I I'm
 
01:23:10.250 --> 01:23:10.260 align:start position:0%
not a provider so yeah
 
01:23:12.590 --> 01:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you Mr
 
01:23:14.810 --> 01:23:14.820 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for being here
 
01:23:16.790 --> 01:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
um I would like to know if Nami would be
 
01:23:19.070 --> 01:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
in support of um limiting this to
 
01:23:20.510 --> 01:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
non-directive counseling where there's
 
01:23:22.430 --> 01:23:22.440 align:start position:0%
not an outcome with a specific carve out
 
01:23:24.830 --> 01:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
for suicide self-harm um those types of
 
01:23:26.510 --> 01:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
dangerous behaviors where obviously
 
01:23:28.970 --> 01:23:28.980 align:start position:0%
you'd want to cancel against that right
 
01:23:30.590 --> 01:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
now thank you for your question right
 
01:23:32.510 --> 01:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
now we believe the current limitation of
 
01:23:35.330 --> 01:23:35.340 align:start position:0%
the uh um did not prescribing medication
 
01:23:37.790 --> 01:23:37.800 align:start position:0%
without parental consent uh is where
 
01:23:39.229 --> 01:23:39.239 align:start position:0%
we're comfortable I don't think we would
 
01:23:40.790 --> 01:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
want to limit it further
 
01:23:43.310 --> 01:23:43.320 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:23:45.649 --> 01:23:45.659 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:23:48.169 --> 01:23:48.179 align:start position:0%
follow up um sorry I'd be interested in
 
01:23:49.669 --> 01:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
knowing what types of directive
 
01:23:51.169 --> 01:23:51.179 align:start position:0%
counseling that you would want to
 
01:23:53.570 --> 01:23:53.580 align:start position:0%
specifically authorize without parental
 
01:23:55.610 --> 01:23:55.620 align:start position:0%
consent so even if that's a follow-up
 
01:23:57.350 --> 01:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
I'd love to get that information from it
 
01:23:59.030 --> 01:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
that would absolutely be a follow-up
 
01:24:06.830 --> 01:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:09.830 --> 01:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:12.590 --> 01:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing no other questions
 
01:24:18.530 --> 01:24:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:20.810 --> 01:24:20.820 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak this morning is
 
01:24:27.910 --> 01:24:27.920 align:start position:0%

01:24:32.930 --> 01:24:32.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:35.630 --> 01:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
I'm here to speak in support but with a
 
01:24:38.689 --> 01:24:38.699 align:start position:0%
reservation about this question of what
 
01:24:42.350 --> 01:24:42.360 align:start position:0%
age and whether it's appropriate to set
 
01:24:46.010 --> 01:24:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:48.229 --> 01:24:48.239 align:start position:0%
um I think
 
01:24:52.250 --> 01:24:52.260 align:start position:0%
most kids by the time they are in
 
01:24:52.260 --> 01:24:53.630 align:start position:0%
most kids by the time they are in
puberty

01:24:53.630 --> 01:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
puberty
 
01:24:56.030 --> 01:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
which is often before that
 
01:25:00.410 --> 01:25:00.420 align:start position:0%
and in the pressures of Middle School
 
01:25:03.290 --> 01:25:03.300 align:start position:0%
are already if they're going to struggle
 
01:25:05.810 --> 01:25:05.820 align:start position:0%
with things like I have struggled with
 
01:25:08.649 --> 01:25:08.659 align:start position:0%
are struggling with it so that's why I
 
01:25:11.030 --> 01:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
asked say that
 
01:25:14.530 --> 01:25:14.540 align:start position:0%
I'm transgender
 
01:25:19.510 --> 01:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
I took another few decades past 16 to
 
01:25:23.450 --> 01:25:23.460 align:start position:0%
get to really understand that
 
01:25:25.430 --> 01:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
and I want to just comment to
 
01:25:29.030 --> 01:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
representative Leon's question that I
 
01:25:30.830 --> 01:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
think directive counseling is an
 
01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:33.050 align:start position:0%
think directive counseling is an
oxymoron

01:25:33.050 --> 01:25:33.060 align:start position:0%
oxymoron
 
01:25:35.570 --> 01:25:35.580 align:start position:0%
so I don't think you need to have that
 
01:25:38.270 --> 01:25:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:38.870 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:25:38.870 --> 01:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:41.390 --> 01:25:41.400 align:start position:0%
counseling should be non-directive I
 
01:25:43.010 --> 01:25:43.020 align:start position:0%
know my first
 
01:25:45.950 --> 01:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
decent counselor in my early 40s when I
 
01:25:48.169 --> 01:25:48.179 align:start position:0%
finally recognized I really needed to
 
01:25:49.850 --> 01:25:49.860 align:start position:0%
have counseling instead of trying to
 
01:25:51.590 --> 01:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
work it out by myself
 
01:25:54.350 --> 01:25:54.360 align:start position:0%
was completely non-directive
 
01:25:56.689 --> 01:25:56.699 align:start position:0%
when I went specifically to a gender
 
01:25:58.970 --> 01:25:58.980 align:start position:0%
counselor I think she was also
 
01:25:58.980 --> 01:26:00.890 align:start position:0%
counselor I think she was also
non-directive

01:26:00.890 --> 01:26:00.900 align:start position:0%
non-directive
 
01:26:04.010 --> 01:26:04.020 align:start position:0%
but the opportunity to seek that care
 
01:26:05.810 --> 01:26:05.820 align:start position:0%
was vital
 
01:26:08.570 --> 01:26:08.580 align:start position:0%
I'm also a retired primary care doctor
 
01:26:11.470 --> 01:26:11.480 align:start position:0%
and so these legal questions are
 
01:26:13.970 --> 01:26:13.980 align:start position:0%
important and I hope you take the time
 
01:26:17.629 --> 01:26:17.639 align:start position:0%
to really work them out and what the age
 
01:26:22.310 --> 01:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
lower limit might be I'm not sure I know
 
01:26:26.750 --> 01:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
the answer to that but I know when I saw
 
01:26:28.729 --> 01:26:28.739 align:start position:0%
a child
 
01:26:31.430 --> 01:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
adolescent or just pre-adolescent with
 
01:26:33.830 --> 01:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
their parents I made it clear to parents
 
01:26:36.050 --> 01:26:36.060 align:start position:0%
that if something was brought to me that
 
01:26:38.149 --> 01:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
the child wanted kept confidential I
 
01:26:40.310 --> 01:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
would do that
 
01:26:42.050 --> 01:26:42.060 align:start position:0%
and if you didn't like that you needed
 
01:26:44.330 --> 01:26:44.340 align:start position:0%
to seek a different position
 
01:26:46.850 --> 01:26:46.860 align:start position:0%
so and I don't think I ever had anybody
 
01:26:49.310 --> 01:26:49.320 align:start position:0%
who said that they objected to that but
 
01:26:50.450 --> 01:26:50.460 align:start position:0%
that may be
 
01:26:52.430 --> 01:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
the kind of people that I took care of
 
01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:53.990 align:start position:0%
the kind of people that I took care of
so

01:26:53.990 --> 01:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:26:58.490 --> 01:26:58.500 align:start position:0%
I I do think it's incredibly important
 
01:27:02.149 --> 01:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
that we not allow barriers to be erected
 
01:27:05.689 --> 01:27:05.699 align:start position:0%
to lgbtq youth or anyone else for that
 
01:27:09.830 --> 01:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
matter whose cultural background
 
01:27:12.229 --> 01:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
is really a conflict with who they feel
 
01:27:14.689 --> 01:27:14.699 align:start position:0%
they need to be
 
01:27:17.870 --> 01:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
and that's that's pretty uh wide group
 
01:27:20.570 --> 01:27:20.580 align:start position:0%
of people and I I appreciate the mention
 
01:27:23.090 --> 01:27:23.100 align:start position:0%
about immigrants I'm very involved in
 
01:27:26.149 --> 01:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
support of immigrant communities
 
01:27:29.510 --> 01:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
and I know this to be really difficult
 
01:27:33.110 --> 01:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
I also have done working
 
01:27:36.169 --> 01:27:36.179 align:start position:0%
Latin America and Africa
 
01:27:39.229 --> 01:27:39.239 align:start position:0%
and I know that attitudes where people
 
01:27:42.290 --> 01:27:42.300 align:start position:0%
come from in those places are severely
 
01:27:44.750 --> 01:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
worse than in most places in this
 
01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:46.129 align:start position:0%
worse than in most places in this
country

01:27:46.129 --> 01:27:46.139 align:start position:0%
country
 
01:27:51.770 --> 01:27:51.780 align:start position:0%
and so trying to allow people not to
 
01:27:53.990 --> 01:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
get to the point that they are suicidal
 
01:27:57.470 --> 01:27:57.480 align:start position:0%
is just incredibly important so please
 
01:28:00.290 --> 01:28:00.300 align:start position:0%
take the time you need on this bill and
 
01:28:03.590 --> 01:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
I prefer a much lower age than 16. thank
 
01:28:07.370 --> 01:28:07.380 align:start position:0%
you okay I will take questions yes
 
01:28:10.310 --> 01:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
uh representative Cushman
 
01:28:11.930 --> 01:28:11.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:28:14.149 --> 01:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:28:16.729 --> 01:28:16.739 align:start position:0%
um I'm just wondering do you see any
 
01:28:19.370 --> 01:28:19.380 align:start position:0%
concern with a parent not knowing that
 
01:28:22.070 --> 01:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
their child is in a private room with an
 
01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:24.050 align:start position:0%
their child is in a private room with an
adult

01:28:24.050 --> 01:28:24.060 align:start position:0%
adult
 
01:28:26.570 --> 01:28:26.580 align:start position:0%
of course that's always an issue when
 
01:28:28.970 --> 01:28:28.980 align:start position:0%
like my faith community we have a very
 
01:28:31.850 --> 01:28:31.860 align:start position:0%
explicit policy for child safety
 
01:28:33.830 --> 01:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
and there's always at least two people
 
01:28:38.510 --> 01:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:40.250 --> 01:28:40.260 align:start position:0%
um and I think that's that is
 
01:28:42.649 --> 01:28:42.659 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily important
 
01:28:47.810 --> 01:28:47.820 align:start position:0%
I hope that we don't have too many cases
 
01:28:50.810 --> 01:28:50.820 align:start position:0%
anywhere of counselors who take
 
01:28:50.820 --> 01:28:51.950 align:start position:0%
anywhere of counselors who take
advantage

01:28:51.950 --> 01:28:51.960 align:start position:0%
advantage
 
01:28:53.870 --> 01:28:53.880 align:start position:0%
um that has happened obviously and
 
01:28:56.030 --> 01:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
that's a an issue that's not
 
01:28:58.970 --> 01:28:58.980 align:start position:0%
non-directive counseling that's for sure
 
01:29:02.470 --> 01:29:02.480 align:start position:0%
and so it's a you know illegal unethical
 
01:29:05.209 --> 01:29:05.219 align:start position:0%
immoral kind of activity you're speaking
 
01:29:07.610 --> 01:29:07.620 align:start position:0%
about so follow-up representative
 
01:29:07.620 --> 01:29:08.570 align:start position:0%
about so follow-up representative
Cushman

01:29:08.570 --> 01:29:08.580 align:start position:0%
Cushman
 
01:29:09.950 --> 01:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:29:13.189 --> 01:29:13.199 align:start position:0%
um just uh what would you think if we
 
01:29:14.990 --> 01:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
required to have two people in the room
 
01:29:16.910 --> 01:29:16.920 align:start position:0%
since that seems like a good way to keep
 
01:29:19.310 --> 01:29:19.320 align:start position:0%
the kids safe during that wow I don't
 
01:29:23.030 --> 01:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
know the a good answer to that obviously
 
01:29:24.830 --> 01:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
um since I presented this mail
 
01:29:27.590 --> 01:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
throughout my career
 
01:29:29.990 --> 01:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
I I always
 
01:29:33.470 --> 01:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
except for extreme older age with women
 
01:29:36.229 --> 01:29:36.239 align:start position:0%
who prefer or not bring a nurse in I
 
01:29:38.689 --> 01:29:38.699 align:start position:0%
always had a nurse come in for anything
 
01:29:42.169 --> 01:29:42.179 align:start position:0%
that was even vaguely intimate
 
01:29:46.129 --> 01:29:46.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:49.850 --> 01:29:49.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:52.610 --> 01:29:52.620 align:start position:0%
would you be willing to tell us a little
 
01:29:55.010 --> 01:29:55.020 align:start position:0%
bit about your professional background I
 
01:29:58.490 --> 01:29:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:01.250 --> 01:30:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:03.290 --> 01:30:03.300 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:30:08.750 --> 01:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:10.850 --> 01:30:10.860 align:start position:0%
also signed up to testify is William
 
01:30:19.610 --> 01:30:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:22.850 --> 01:30:22.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I apologize to the
 
01:30:25.689 --> 01:30:25.699 align:start position:0%
committee I'm way out of my league here
 
01:30:28.129 --> 01:30:28.139 align:start position:0%
and I'm nervous as anything I've heard
 
01:30:30.950 --> 01:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
all the phds and doctors and stuff but
 
01:30:34.070 --> 01:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
I'm just a parent and a grandparent and
 
01:30:37.189 --> 01:30:37.199 align:start position:0%
it would seem to me I've heard the word
 
01:30:40.490 --> 01:30:40.500 align:start position:0%
uh Team suicide is up it's up it's up we
 
01:30:42.770 --> 01:30:42.780 align:start position:0%
need to get them into counseling and
 
01:30:45.229 --> 01:30:45.239 align:start position:0%
stuff it would seem to me that would
 
01:30:49.129 --> 01:30:49.139 align:start position:0%
make common sense that if a child that
 
01:30:52.729 --> 01:30:52.739 align:start position:0%
age who we know is very confused it's a
 
01:30:55.129 --> 01:30:55.139 align:start position:0%
rough aid for any kid to be at it would
 
01:30:56.689 --> 01:30:56.699 align:start position:0%
seem to me the health professionals
 
01:30:59.570 --> 01:30:59.580 align:start position:0%
would want more than anything
 
01:31:01.970 --> 01:31:01.980 align:start position:0%
more than anything to have the parents
 
01:31:01.980 --> 01:31:03.890 align:start position:0%
more than anything to have the parents
involved

01:31:03.890 --> 01:31:03.900 align:start position:0%
involved
 
01:31:06.110 --> 01:31:06.120 align:start position:0%
so it would see so this seems
 
01:31:07.790 --> 01:31:07.800 align:start position:0%
counterintuitive to me why would you
 
01:31:09.890 --> 01:31:09.900 align:start position:0%
want to do it without the parents
 
01:31:09.900 --> 01:31:11.629 align:start position:0%
want to do it without the parents
consent

01:31:11.629 --> 01:31:11.639 align:start position:0%
consent
 
01:31:13.370 --> 01:31:13.380 align:start position:0%
the parents would have a right to know
 
01:31:16.430 --> 01:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
not a need to know the parents are the
 
01:31:18.669 --> 01:31:18.679 align:start position:0%
ones most likely to help that child
 
01:31:21.410 --> 01:31:21.420 align:start position:0%
reach the correct decision
 
01:31:25.550 --> 01:31:25.560 align:start position:0%
and I I would not bring this up but I've
 
01:31:27.410 --> 01:31:27.420 align:start position:0%
heard three of the people tests and by
 
01:31:28.910 --> 01:31:28.920 align:start position:0%
the way I'm opposed to this bill I'm
 
01:31:31.129 --> 01:31:31.139 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm not used to this I guess
 
01:31:32.990 --> 01:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
you're supposed to say that first
 
01:31:34.850 --> 01:31:34.860 align:start position:0%
but I've heard three of the people who
 
01:31:37.490 --> 01:31:37.500 align:start position:0%
were for this bill testify and bring up
 
01:31:37.500 --> 01:31:38.810 align:start position:0%
were for this bill testify and bring up
the

01:31:38.810 --> 01:31:38.820 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:31:41.229 --> 01:31:41.239 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:31:45.890 --> 01:31:45.900 align:start position:0%
lgbtq and frankly a lot of parents are
 
01:31:47.990 --> 01:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
very frightened of of
 
01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.209 align:start position:0%
very frightened of of
what

01:31:50.209 --> 01:31:50.219 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:31:52.910 --> 01:31:52.920 align:start position:0%
it's one thing to how do I put it's one
 
01:31:55.629 --> 01:31:55.639 align:start position:0%
thing if a child is honestly feeling
 
01:31:59.510 --> 01:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
confused and gender confused and stuff
 
01:32:02.270 --> 01:32:02.280 align:start position:0%
and people they talk about it or
 
01:32:04.550 --> 01:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
whatever but it definitely seems and I
 
01:32:06.770 --> 01:32:06.780 align:start position:0%
know a lot of parents feel that this is
 
01:32:10.310 --> 01:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
being pushed being pushed and so maybe
 
01:32:13.129 --> 01:32:13.139 align:start position:0%
I'm crazy but it seems to me like this
 
01:32:15.530 --> 01:32:15.540 align:start position:0%
bill is trying to hide what's going on
 
01:32:18.709 --> 01:32:18.719 align:start position:0%
from the parents so I think that's all I
 
01:32:20.629 --> 01:32:20.639 align:start position:0%
have to say thank you okay you taking
 
01:32:23.209 --> 01:32:23.219 align:start position:0%
questions sir are you all set well if I
 
01:32:25.310 --> 01:32:25.320 align:start position:0%
don't I don't know anything so but you
 
01:32:29.390 --> 01:32:29.400 align:start position:0%
can ask okay okay thank you uh
 
01:32:31.729 --> 01:32:31.739 align:start position:0%
representative King
 
01:32:33.530 --> 01:32:33.540 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman McDonald thank you
 
01:32:35.689 --> 01:32:35.699 align:start position:0%
for speaking today
 
01:32:35.699 --> 01:32:36.229 align:start position:0%
for speaking today
um

01:32:36.229 --> 01:32:36.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:38.390 --> 01:32:38.400 align:start position:0%
if I had to take a guess if I had to
 
01:32:39.470 --> 01:32:39.480 align:start position:0%
take a guess I'm just making an
 
01:32:41.689 --> 01:32:41.699 align:start position:0%
assumption you probably see you and
 
01:32:43.250 --> 01:32:43.260 align:start position:0%
probably your wife as pretty good
 
01:32:44.990 --> 01:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
parents and you probably had pretty good
 
01:32:46.910 --> 01:32:46.920 align:start position:0%
parents yourself yes
 
01:32:50.090 --> 01:32:50.100 align:start position:0%
um but no no no no no okay well then
 
01:32:52.129 --> 01:32:52.139 align:start position:0%
that's a incorrect incorrect assumption
 
01:32:53.570 --> 01:32:53.580 align:start position:0%
of my part but
 
01:32:56.090 --> 01:32:56.100 align:start position:0%
um troubled childhood I was very blessed
 
01:32:57.770 --> 01:32:57.780 align:start position:0%
to have wonderful parents but you know
 
01:32:59.870 --> 01:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
some of my some of my friends they had
 
01:33:03.169 --> 01:33:03.179 align:start position:0%
terrible parents really terrible parents
 
01:33:03.179 --> 01:33:05.030 align:start position:0%
terrible parents really terrible parents
and

01:33:05.030 --> 01:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:33:07.850 --> 01:33:07.860 align:start position:0%
um the only reason that I could see that
 
01:33:11.510 --> 01:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
a 16 or 17 year old would go to get
 
01:33:13.970 --> 01:33:13.980 align:start position:0%
mental health counseling without the
 
01:33:16.189 --> 01:33:16.199 align:start position:0%
knowledge of their parents is if there's
 
01:33:18.050 --> 01:33:18.060 align:start position:0%
a serious issue between them and their
 
01:33:20.030 --> 01:33:20.040 align:start position:0%
parents and
 
01:33:21.830 --> 01:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
um does that concern I mean what about
 
01:33:23.930 --> 01:33:23.940 align:start position:0%
the kids who who have really awful
 
01:33:26.270 --> 01:33:26.280 align:start position:0%
parents and and they need somebody I
 
01:33:27.229 --> 01:33:27.239 align:start position:0%
mean what are your thoughts on that
 
01:33:29.570 --> 01:33:29.580 align:start position:0%
thank you I could certainly see that and
 
01:33:31.970 --> 01:33:31.980 align:start position:0%
that's certainly that may have been the
 
01:33:34.310 --> 01:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
case even I had a very very rough
 
01:33:36.649 --> 01:33:36.659 align:start position:0%
childhood because of
 
01:33:38.689 --> 01:33:38.699 align:start position:0%
rough parenting
 
01:33:38.699 --> 01:33:39.410 align:start position:0%
rough parenting
um

01:33:39.410 --> 01:33:39.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:39.420 --> 01:33:40.910 align:start position:0%
um
but

01:33:40.910 --> 01:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:33:43.669 --> 01:33:43.679 align:start position:0%
of course of course the parents might be
 
01:33:45.709 --> 01:33:45.719 align:start position:0%
the problem if it's an abusive or
 
01:33:48.290 --> 01:33:48.300 align:start position:0%
something but
 
01:33:50.510 --> 01:33:50.520 align:start position:0%
is shouldn't there be
 
01:33:54.709 --> 01:33:54.719 align:start position:0%
us shouldn't it be some way where an
 
01:33:56.810 --> 01:33:56.820 align:start position:0%
impartial third party here's what's
 
01:33:58.370 --> 01:33:58.380 align:start position:0%
going on
 
01:34:02.090 --> 01:34:02.100 align:start position:0%
and then make a determination yes this
 
01:34:03.709 --> 01:34:03.719 align:start position:0%
we should go forward with mental health
 
01:34:06.169 --> 01:34:06.179 align:start position:0%
treatment for this child without parents
 
01:34:08.570 --> 01:34:08.580 align:start position:0%
consent or no there's really no reason
 
01:34:11.810 --> 01:34:11.820 align:start position:0%
to let's get the parents involved I can
 
01:34:14.750 --> 01:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
certainly see that but
 
01:34:17.810 --> 01:34:17.820 align:start position:0%
but again the fear is
 
01:34:21.950 --> 01:34:21.960 align:start position:0%
is that there is a push
 
01:34:25.189 --> 01:34:25.199 align:start position:0%
to to transition our children I don't
 
01:34:27.530 --> 01:34:27.540 align:start position:0%
know how to say it without saying it
 
01:34:30.530 --> 01:34:30.540 align:start position:0%
thank you the other representative King
 
01:34:34.490 --> 01:34:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:34.500 --> 01:34:38.169 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:34:38.169 --> 01:34:38.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:40.669 --> 01:34:40.679 align:start position:0%
oh it's okay
 
01:34:42.410 --> 01:34:42.420 align:start position:0%
can you tell I'm not comfortable and
 
01:34:44.990 --> 01:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
want to get out of here at least out of

um and thank you for obliging
 
01:34:55.790 --> 01:34:55.800 align:start position:0%
um but can we just make it clear that
 
01:34:57.229 --> 01:34:57.239 align:start position:0%
they don't have to answer questions
 
01:34:59.209 --> 01:34:59.219 align:start position:0%
right you don't you're not obligated no
 
01:35:00.830 --> 01:35:00.840 align:start position:0%
no that's why I asked you if you wanted
 
01:35:03.649 --> 01:35:03.659 align:start position:0%
any questions no no I'm I'm perfectly

non-doctors and non-nurses on this
 
01:35:35.350 --> 01:35:35.360 align:start position:0%
committee I'm also intimidated
 
01:35:38.149 --> 01:35:38.159 align:start position:0%
so thank you for coming out today my
 
01:35:40.430 --> 01:35:40.440 align:start position:0%
questions along the same lines of the
 
01:35:45.050 --> 01:35:45.060 align:start position:0%
other representative Seth King and
 
01:35:46.430 --> 01:35:46.440 align:start position:0%
um and I
 
01:35:48.709 --> 01:35:48.719 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of bad parents out there
 
01:35:51.250 --> 01:35:51.260 align:start position:0%
that don't know how to deal with this
 
01:35:56.030 --> 01:35:56.040 align:start position:0%
and my question to you is how how do we
 
01:35:59.810 --> 01:35:59.820 align:start position:0%
uh inform parents how do we uh I don't
 
01:36:02.330 --> 01:36:02.340 align:start position:0%
know if it's a community or whatever but
 
01:36:07.070 --> 01:36:07.080 align:start position:0%
how how could you get involved in your
 
01:36:10.129 --> 01:36:10.139 align:start position:0%
community to to inform parents on the
 
01:36:12.709 --> 01:36:12.719 align:start position:0%
right way to uh to approach this
 
01:36:14.890 --> 01:36:14.900 align:start position:0%
thank you bye
 
01:36:17.390 --> 01:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
that's that's that's out there I don't
 
01:36:19.370 --> 01:36:19.380 align:start position:0%
know that I have the expertise
 
01:36:22.550 --> 01:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
to even get involved but
 
01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:24.770 align:start position:0%
to even get involved but
again

01:36:24.770 --> 01:36:24.780 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:36:28.790 --> 01:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't know I'm sorry
 
01:36:31.070 --> 01:36:31.080 align:start position:0%
it's a good question and that I'm
 
01:36:32.270 --> 01:36:32.280 align:start position:0%
supposed to say thank you for that
 
01:36:32.280 --> 01:36:33.550 align:start position:0%
supposed to say thank you for that
question

01:36:33.550 --> 01:36:33.560 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:36:36.890 --> 01:36:36.900 align:start position:0%
and it's a good question but
 
01:36:38.209 --> 01:36:38.219 align:start position:0%
yeah I just want to say it's an
 
01:36:39.649 --> 01:36:39.659 align:start position:0%
opportunity out there and I don't know
 
01:36:41.990 --> 01:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
if Mr Hawkins is still here but you may
 
01:36:44.870 --> 01:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
want to talk to somebody from Nami and
 
01:36:47.270 --> 01:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
um and that might help that may be a way
 
01:36:49.669 --> 01:36:49.679 align:start position:0%
to go is you know again the third party
 
01:36:53.870 --> 01:36:53.880 align:start position:0%
thing is is let someone who has no
 
01:36:53.880 --> 01:36:54.890 align:start position:0%
thing is is let someone who has no
um

01:36:54.890 --> 01:36:54.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:56.870 --> 01:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
it you know I don't know what no chicken
 
01:36:59.990 --> 01:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
in the fight or something no no no ax to
 
01:37:02.330 --> 01:37:02.340 align:start position:0%
grind No Agenda
 
01:37:05.330 --> 01:37:05.340 align:start position:0%
that they might help be help maybe we
 
01:37:08.149 --> 01:37:08.159 align:start position:0%
have a community board that
 
01:37:10.250 --> 01:37:10.260 align:start position:0%
if that comes up a professional can go
 
01:37:13.129 --> 01:37:13.139 align:start position:0%
to the board and lay out the facts and
 
01:37:15.470 --> 01:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
hear everything in the board make that
 
01:37:17.450 --> 01:37:17.460 align:start position:0%
determination although that seems
 
01:37:19.070 --> 01:37:19.080 align:start position:0%
counterintuitive because we've got way
 
01:37:20.930 --> 01:37:20.940 align:start position:0%
too many boards and way too many rules
 
01:37:23.810 --> 01:37:23.820 align:start position:0%
and way too many laws already so hey
 
01:37:26.030 --> 01:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr I'm going to sit here all
 
01:37:28.490 --> 01:37:28.500 align:start position:0%

01:38:51.530 --> 01:38:51.540 align:start position:0%
before I joined but due to my plan to
 
01:38:54.709 --> 01:38:54.719 align:start position:0%
expand my own family I chose to delay my
 
01:38:57.530 --> 01:38:57.540 align:start position:0%
participation until 2017.
 
01:39:02.090 --> 01:39:02.100 align:start position:0%
I was given this 18-page document
 
01:39:04.490 --> 01:39:04.500 align:start position:0%
explaining the risks benefits and
 
01:39:07.669 --> 01:39:07.679 align:start position:0%
expectations of a participant and what
 
01:39:09.649 --> 01:39:09.659 align:start position:0%
the responsibility and liability the
 
01:39:12.530 --> 01:39:12.540 align:start position:0%
researchers had by conducting the trial
 
01:39:14.990 --> 01:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
all participants in the lead researchers
 
01:39:16.970 --> 01:39:16.980 align:start position:0%
sign these informed consent agreements
 
01:39:19.490 --> 01:39:19.500 align:start position:0%
in my personal Research into this I read
 
01:39:21.830 --> 01:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
the data from the trials conducted on
 
01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:22.850 align:start position:0%

and the previous 100-year human use of
 
01:39:27.410 --> 01:39:27.420 align:start position:0%
this particular vaccine before making my
 
01:39:29.810 --> 01:39:29.820 align:start position:0%
decision to move forward I volunteered
 
01:39:32.209 --> 01:39:32.219 align:start position:0%
for an experiment knowing my risks and
 
01:39:35.149 --> 01:39:35.159 align:start position:0%
reward potential
 
01:39:37.430 --> 01:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
just as I have done times before because
 
01:39:40.250 --> 01:39:40.260 align:start position:0%
I believe in science I know data must be
 
01:39:41.990 --> 01:39:42.000 align:start position:0%

early last month the FDA and CDC

uncovered a possible safety issue for
 
01:40:58.129 --> 01:40:58.139 align:start position:0%
individuals over age 65 that showed they
 
01:40:59.990 --> 01:41:00.000 align:start position:0%

England Journal of Medicine has

01:42:11.689 --> 01:42:11.699 align:start position:0%
response on November 22nd the CDC
 
01:42:13.550 --> 01:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
published data on the effectiveness of
 
01:42:16.970 --> 01:42:16.980 align:start position:0%

monovalent vaccine two to three months
 
01:42:28.070 --> 01:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
earlier the Extra Protection associated
 
01:42:30.590 --> 01:42:30.600 align:start position:0%
with the bivalent booster range from 28

to 31 percent
 
01:42:34.910 --> 01:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
I would not suggest we limit a private
 
01:42:37.189 --> 01:42:37.199 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy hospital or Provider from
 
01:42:39.050 --> 01:42:39.060 align:start position:0%
choosing to distribute any products for
 
01:42:41.750 --> 01:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
clinical trial the this legislation does
 
01:42:43.910 --> 01:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
not limit their ability to do that
 
01:42:46.669 --> 01:42:46.679 align:start position:0%
according to my inquiries with DHHS
 
01:42:48.470 --> 01:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
pharmacies participating in the federal
 
01:42:50.450 --> 01:42:50.460 align:start position:0%
Retail Pharmacy partnership program
 
01:42:52.370 --> 01:42:52.380 align:start position:0%
places orders through a Supply Chain
 
01:42:54.229 --> 01:42:54.239 align:start position:0%
management system independent of the
 
01:42:54.239 --> 01:42:55.129 align:start position:0%
management system independent of the
state

01:42:55.129 --> 01:42:55.139 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:42:57.169 --> 01:42:57.179 align:start position:0%
they also received direct shipments from
 
01:42:58.669 --> 01:42:58.679 align:start position:0%
manufacturers without passing through
 
01:43:00.470 --> 01:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
the state this is a federal program
 
01:43:02.570 --> 01:43:02.580 align:start position:0%
where retail pharmacies vaccinate in
 
01:43:05.510 --> 01:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
long-term care settings however in cases
 
01:43:07.910 --> 01:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
where quantities did not meet the Direct
 
01:43:09.830 --> 01:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
ship threshold the vaccine was
 
01:43:11.689 --> 01:43:11.699 align:start position:0%
distributed by the state after September
 
01:43:14.030 --> 01:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
6th after taking into consideration the
 
01:43:16.310 --> 01:43:16.320 align:start position:0%
needs of the vaccinating provider
 
01:43:19.129 --> 01:43:19.139 align:start position:0%
this would stop the spending of taxpayer
 
01:43:21.410 --> 01:43:21.420 align:start position:0%
funds on Advertising dispensing and
 
01:43:23.209 --> 01:43:23.219 align:start position:0%
purchasing of products or vaccines that
 
01:43:24.709 --> 01:43:24.719 align:start position:0%
have not been tested
 
01:43:27.709 --> 01:43:27.719 align:start position:0%
through human clinical trials the people
 
01:43:29.390 --> 01:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire deserve the opportunity
 
01:43:31.870 --> 01:43:31.880 align:start position:0%
to give informed consent
 
01:43:35.750 --> 01:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
thank you questions
 
01:43:38.149 --> 01:43:38.159 align:start position:0%
representative Coachman thank you Mr
 
01:43:38.159 --> 01:43:39.109 align:start position:0%
representative Coachman thank you Mr
chairman

01:43:39.109 --> 01:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:43:42.050 --> 01:43:42.060 align:start position:0%
thank you for bringing this bill forward
 
01:43:43.550 --> 01:43:43.560 align:start position:0%
um what would be the consequences of
 
01:43:46.430 --> 01:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
skipping human clinical trials in a drug
 
01:43:47.930 --> 01:43:47.940 align:start position:0%
development do you have any background
 
01:43:50.090 --> 01:43:50.100 align:start position:0%
on that
 
01:43:50.100 --> 01:43:51.109 align:start position:0%
on that
death

01:43:51.109 --> 01:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
death
 
01:43:52.970 --> 01:43:52.980 align:start position:0%
I mean so like
 
01:43:55.970 --> 01:43:55.980 align:start position:0%
phase of clinical one of human trials is
 
01:43:57.590 --> 01:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
phase one and that determines whether or
 
01:43:59.330 --> 01:43:59.340 align:start position:0%
not it will it will kill a human subject
 
01:44:04.310 --> 01:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:10.490 --> 01:44:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:14.390 --> 01:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't we by passing this legislation
 
01:44:16.970 --> 01:44:16.980 align:start position:0%
be interfering severely with the rights
 
01:44:20.030 --> 01:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
of those of us who uh during the
 
01:44:22.669 --> 01:44:22.679 align:start position:0%
pandemic and understanding just as you
 
01:44:24.770 --> 01:44:24.780 align:start position:0%
understood the risks and made a decision
 
01:44:26.390 --> 01:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
for yourself
 
01:44:29.149 --> 01:44:29.159 align:start position:0%
uh wouldn't it be interfering with the
 
01:44:31.550 --> 01:44:31.560 align:start position:0%
rights of those of us who
 
01:44:31.560 --> 01:44:32.649 align:start position:0%
rights of those of us who
um

01:44:32.649 --> 01:44:32.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:35.330 --> 01:44:35.340 align:start position:0%
knew the lack of knowledge
 
01:44:40.790 --> 01:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
and chose very willingly to accept the
 
01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:42.070 align:start position:0%
and chose very willingly to accept the
vaccines

01:44:42.070 --> 01:44:42.080 align:start position:0%
vaccines
 
01:44:45.109 --> 01:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
aren't you interfering in the other
 
01:44:45.119 --> 01:44:46.970 align:start position:0%
aren't you interfering in the other
direction

01:44:46.970 --> 01:44:46.980 align:start position:0%
direction
 
01:44:49.970 --> 01:44:49.980 align:start position:0%
no because the private you know
 
01:44:52.129 --> 01:44:52.139 align:start position:0%
pharmacies providers could still
 
01:44:53.689 --> 01:44:53.699 align:start position:0%
distribute it if they want I still want
 
01:44:59.149 --> 01:44:59.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:02.030 --> 01:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:04.189 --> 01:45:04.199 align:start position:0%
but isn't it true that in the case of
 
01:45:06.410 --> 01:45:06.420 align:start position:0%
the pandemic if it had not been paid for
 
01:45:08.090 --> 01:45:08.100 align:start position:0%
by the state it would not have been
 
01:45:11.330 --> 01:45:11.340 align:start position:0%
manufactured or available
 
01:45:14.689 --> 01:45:14.699 align:start position:0%
so the federal government bought the
 
01:45:16.850 --> 01:45:16.860 align:start position:0%
vaccines and then distributed them to
 
01:45:19.250 --> 01:45:19.260 align:start position:0%
state so I don't agree with that but the
 
01:45:22.609 --> 01:45:22.619 align:start position:0%
state did pay to advertise it and I mean
 
01:45:24.830 --> 01:45:24.840 align:start position:0%
they they may speak on it to say that it
 
01:45:27.590 --> 01:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
came from federal grants
 
01:45:29.450 --> 01:45:29.460 align:start position:0%
um so like there is no fiscal note on
 
01:45:31.609 --> 01:45:31.619 align:start position:0%
this which I'm surprised because if they
 
01:45:32.930 --> 01:45:32.940 align:start position:0%
stop doing it they must be getting it
 
01:45:35.149 --> 01:45:35.159 align:start position:0%
from federal grants so I'm sorry I
 
01:45:38.270 --> 01:45:38.280 align:start position:0%
forgot the original question I was
 
01:45:41.930 --> 01:45:41.940 align:start position:0%
the point of my original question was my
 
01:45:43.910 --> 01:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
concern would be that if this were in
 
01:45:43.920 --> 01:45:45.050 align:start position:0%
concern would be that if this were in
place

01:45:45.050 --> 01:45:45.060 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:45:45.060 --> 01:45:46.430 align:start position:0%
place
uh

01:45:46.430 --> 01:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:45:50.709 --> 01:45:50.719 align:start position:0%
no matter whose dollars they were
 
01:45:53.570 --> 01:45:53.580 align:start position:0%
the drug would not have been
 
01:45:56.330 --> 01:45:56.340 align:start position:0%
manufactured in the quantities it was or
 
01:45:58.910 --> 01:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
made available to the many many people
 
01:46:01.850 --> 01:46:01.860 align:start position:0%
who very much wanted it despite the lack
 
01:46:03.290 --> 01:46:03.300 align:start position:0%
of knowledge
 
01:46:07.370 --> 01:46:07.380 align:start position:0%
uh if federal dollars had not been
 
01:46:09.590 --> 01:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
involved because the drug simply
 
01:46:11.510 --> 01:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have been manufactured if you
 
01:46:13.609 --> 01:46:13.619 align:start position:0%
had to wait until after somebody was
 
01:46:13.619 --> 01:46:15.490 align:start position:0%
had to wait until after somebody was
ready

01:46:15.490 --> 01:46:15.500 align:start position:0%
ready
 
01:46:17.870 --> 01:46:17.880 align:start position:0%
until there wouldn't have been the
 
01:46:19.490 --> 01:46:19.500 align:start position:0%
demand and
 
01:46:21.770 --> 01:46:21.780 align:start position:0%
the payment in advance for the
 
01:46:21.780 --> 01:46:27.050 align:start position:0%
the payment in advance for the
manufacturing

01:46:27.050 --> 01:46:27.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:29.030 --> 01:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
I'm not
 
01:46:30.530 --> 01:46:30.540 align:start position:0%
I'm not sorry I don't know the answer to
 
01:46:33.709 --> 01:46:33.719 align:start position:0%
your question okay thank you though
 
01:46:37.070 --> 01:46:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:38.870 --> 01:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:46:40.070 --> 01:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
01:46:44.990 --> 01:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
um I heard you to say that you were not
 
01:46:47.390 --> 01:46:47.400 align:start position:0%
um against the vaccines per se but
 
01:46:48.649 --> 01:46:48.659 align:start position:0%
rather that
 
01:46:50.270 --> 01:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
um that you felt they were rushed
 
01:46:52.910 --> 01:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
through without the proper testing on
 
01:46:52.920 --> 01:46:54.229 align:start position:0%
through without the proper testing on
um

01:46:54.229 --> 01:46:54.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:57.770 --> 01:46:57.780 align:start position:0%
on human beings but at the same time a
 
01:47:00.530 --> 01:47:00.540 align:start position:0%
lot of your testimony was talking about
 
01:47:04.010 --> 01:47:04.020 align:start position:0%
how detrimental the vaccines were
 
01:47:07.070 --> 01:47:07.080 align:start position:0%
as someone who took every vaccine I
 
01:47:09.169 --> 01:47:09.179 align:start position:0%
could get and who believes in the
 
01:47:10.910 --> 01:47:10.920 align:start position:0%
vaccines and who believes they've been
 
01:47:13.910 --> 01:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
extremely helpful I would have to say I
 
01:47:17.510 --> 01:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
agree with you that this was rushed
 
01:47:17.520 --> 01:47:18.770 align:start position:0%
agree with you that this was rushed
through

01:47:18.770 --> 01:47:18.780 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:47:21.830 --> 01:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
and that there was not um
 
01:47:25.370 --> 01:47:25.380 align:start position:0%
as much research and as much testing as
 
01:47:28.070 --> 01:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
all of us would have liked
 
01:47:31.970 --> 01:47:31.980 align:start position:0%
um but it was an emergency a million
 
01:47:33.410 --> 01:47:33.420 align:start position:0%
Americans died
 
01:47:38.689 --> 01:47:38.699 align:start position:0%
and um I wonder at what point you might
 
01:47:42.169 --> 01:47:42.179 align:start position:0%
have thought that it does make sense for
 
01:47:46.189 --> 01:47:46.199 align:start position:0%
vaccines to be used without the
 
01:47:46.199 --> 01:47:47.750 align:start position:0%
vaccines to be used without the
um

01:47:47.750 --> 01:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:50.510 --> 01:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
optimal amount of testing I mean what if
 
01:47:53.270 --> 01:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
covid-19 had killed people at twice the
 
01:47:55.790 --> 01:47:55.800 align:start position:0%
rate or three times the rate
 
01:47:55.800 --> 01:47:56.750 align:start position:0%
rate or three times the rate
um

01:47:56.750 --> 01:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:00.290 --> 01:48:00.300 align:start position:0%
would then it have made sense to
 
01:48:03.109 --> 01:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
um go forward without the optimal amount
 
01:48:06.530 --> 01:48:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:08.209 --> 01:48:08.219 align:start position:0%
I believe in informed consent and I do
 
01:48:09.830 --> 01:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
believe that Granite State or
 
01:48:12.229 --> 01:48:12.239 align:start position:0%
specifically have taken this thinking it
 
01:48:14.930 --> 01:48:14.940 align:start position:0%
was safer or further tested than it was
 
01:48:16.669 --> 01:48:16.679 align:start position:0%
and I think we're finding out now that
 
01:48:18.350 --> 01:48:18.360 align:start position:0%
it's maybe not as effective as they
 
01:48:19.790 --> 01:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
touted in the beginning or they thought
 
01:48:22.370 --> 01:48:22.380 align:start position:0%
it to be and that it might be dangerous
 
01:48:24.410 --> 01:48:24.420 align:start position:0%
which is why I read those those pieces
 
01:48:26.209 --> 01:48:26.219 align:start position:0%
of information
 
01:48:29.209 --> 01:48:29.219 align:start position:0%
um I'm not like I said I did a five-year
 
01:48:31.609 --> 01:48:31.619 align:start position:0%
trial and I participated in it because I
 
01:48:33.050 --> 01:48:33.060 align:start position:0%
thought it could improve an outcome that
 
01:48:35.390 --> 01:48:35.400 align:start position:0%
I personally was from a chronic illness
 
01:48:37.310 --> 01:48:37.320 align:start position:0%
so I think that people can still
 
01:48:39.530 --> 01:48:39.540 align:start position:0%
participate in these trials or like you
 
01:48:42.229 --> 01:48:42.239 align:start position:0%
said in an emergency but what
 
01:48:43.729 --> 01:48:43.739 align:start position:0%
there are people who are mandated to
 
01:48:45.109 --> 01:48:45.119 align:start position:0%
take this as well that's a whole nother
 
01:48:46.970 --> 01:48:46.980 align:start position:0%
we don't want to go down that road but
 
01:48:48.910 --> 01:48:48.920 align:start position:0%
they had to take it to keep their job
 
01:48:51.229 --> 01:48:51.239 align:start position:0%
right and so people will say you have
 
01:48:52.729 --> 01:48:52.739 align:start position:0%
choice you could just not have a job but
 
01:48:54.590 --> 01:48:54.600 align:start position:0%
you know there's I think that the state
 
01:48:56.209 --> 01:48:56.219 align:start position:0%
should get out of the business of of
 
01:48:58.850 --> 01:48:58.860 align:start position:0%
enrolling our citizens into a clinical
 
01:49:01.189 --> 01:49:01.199 align:start position:0%
trial which is what this was emergency
 
01:49:03.109 --> 01:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
or not
 
01:49:03.119 --> 01:49:04.550 align:start position:0%
or not
follow

01:49:04.550 --> 01:49:04.560 align:start position:0%
follow
 
01:49:08.270 --> 01:49:08.280 align:start position:0%
I'll just ask you again can you conceive
 
01:49:10.189 --> 01:49:10.199 align:start position:0%
of any emergency that might have been
 
01:49:14.930 --> 01:49:14.940 align:start position:0%
more intense or the rate of fatalities
 
01:49:18.290 --> 01:49:18.300 align:start position:0%
larger where
 
01:49:21.290 --> 01:49:21.300 align:start position:0%
it would have shortcuts would have been
 
01:49:21.300 --> 01:49:24.109 align:start position:0%
it would have shortcuts would have been
okay

01:49:24.109 --> 01:49:24.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:26.990 --> 01:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
I believe that the covid-19 virus was
 
01:49:29.810 --> 01:49:29.820 align:start position:0%
was deadly to some groups I do I so I
 
01:49:32.570 --> 01:49:32.580 align:start position:0%
believe that maybe the emergency youth
 
01:49:35.270 --> 01:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
of this vaccine
 
01:49:37.250 --> 01:49:37.260 align:start position:0%
might have been more
 
01:49:40.189 --> 01:49:40.199 align:start position:0%
appropriately geared towards older
 
01:49:42.169 --> 01:49:42.179 align:start position:0%
populations in the beginning I'm not
 
01:49:43.490 --> 01:49:43.500 align:start position:0%
sure if I agree with that now I'm I'm
 
01:49:45.410 --> 01:49:45.420 align:start position:0%
just it's I'm not a doctor I just think
 
01:49:47.930 --> 01:49:47.940 align:start position:0%
what happened is not being transparent
 
01:49:51.350 --> 01:49:51.360 align:start position:0%
and I think informed consent is a very
 
01:49:54.350 --> 01:49:54.360 align:start position:0%
important step and I don't think we had
 
01:49:55.970 --> 01:49:55.980 align:start position:0%
that I think it was very rushed and I
 
01:49:57.950 --> 01:49:57.960 align:start position:0%
don't understand why the state is
 
01:49:59.570 --> 01:49:59.580 align:start position:0%
involved in this
 
01:50:01.729 --> 01:50:01.739 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Merchant and
 
01:50:03.530 --> 01:50:03.540 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman
 
01:50:06.350 --> 01:50:06.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Miss Mr chairman and also
 
01:50:07.010 --> 01:50:07.020 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question
 
01:50:07.020 --> 01:50:08.810 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question
representative

01:50:08.810 --> 01:50:08.820 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:50:10.970 --> 01:50:10.980 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned about creating a two-tier
 
01:50:10.980 --> 01:50:11.810 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned about creating a two-tier
system

01:50:11.810 --> 01:50:11.820 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:50:14.689 --> 01:50:14.699 align:start position:0%
so if I have private insurance
 
01:50:17.930 --> 01:50:17.940 align:start position:0%
I can take the ability to opt in and get
 
01:50:20.030 --> 01:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
the vaccine however from covered by a
 
01:50:22.189 --> 01:50:22.199 align:start position:0%
state-funded program I don't have that
 
01:50:23.629 --> 01:50:23.639 align:start position:0%
right so therefore you're taking my
 
01:50:26.930 --> 01:50:26.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:28.910 --> 01:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
I mean they say this vaccine is free
 
01:50:31.490 --> 01:50:31.500 align:start position:0%
they don't charge the the federal
 
01:50:33.770 --> 01:50:33.780 align:start position:0%
government paid for this taxpayers paid
 
01:50:36.770 --> 01:50:36.780 align:start position:0%
for this follow-up sure follow up I
 
01:50:38.570 --> 01:50:38.580 align:start position:0%
guess the question is that if the state
 
01:50:41.750 --> 01:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
is paying for it and I'm covered through
 
01:50:44.030 --> 01:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
a policy insurance policy funded by
 
01:50:46.250 --> 01:50:46.260 align:start position:0%
public dollars
 
01:50:48.649 --> 01:50:48.659 align:start position:0%
I don't have the same rights as somebody
 
01:50:50.689 --> 01:50:50.699 align:start position:0%
else who has private insurance
 
01:50:52.609 --> 01:50:52.619 align:start position:0%
and that's basically taken my rights
 
01:50:53.870 --> 01:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
away from me
 
01:50:56.270 --> 01:50:56.280 align:start position:0%
and I don't believe in the state we want
 
01:50:59.209 --> 01:50:59.219 align:start position:0%
to take people's rights away you can opt
 
01:51:01.310 --> 01:51:01.320 align:start position:0%
in or opt out so therefore if the
 
01:51:03.109 --> 01:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
state's not paying for it I pay for it
 
01:51:05.450 --> 01:51:05.460 align:start position:0%
on my pocket you're taking my rights
 
01:51:07.850 --> 01:51:07.860 align:start position:0%
away from me are you not
 
01:51:09.709 --> 01:51:09.719 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't believe that any
 
01:51:12.350 --> 01:51:12.360 align:start position:0%
insurance Medicaid or otherwise paid for
 
01:51:14.450 --> 01:51:14.460 align:start position:0%
doses of vaccine
 
01:51:16.310 --> 01:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
is that your question
 
01:51:18.109 --> 01:51:18.119 align:start position:0%
no because the question I'm trying to
 
01:51:20.750 --> 01:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
get to is that if you boil it down to
 
01:51:23.030 --> 01:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
the state regardless of how it was
 
01:51:25.070 --> 01:51:25.080 align:start position:0%
funded by the federal government of the
 
01:51:26.149 --> 01:51:26.159 align:start position:0%
state government
 
01:51:28.490 --> 01:51:28.500 align:start position:0%
if I'm under a state policy that's
 
01:51:30.109 --> 01:51:30.119 align:start position:0%
funded by the state
 
01:51:33.830 --> 01:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
my rights as an individual are being
 
01:51:33.840 --> 01:51:35.030 align:start position:0%
my rights as an individual are being
denied

01:51:35.030 --> 01:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
denied
 
01:51:37.729 --> 01:51:37.739 align:start position:0%
versus if I have commercial payer on my
 
01:51:39.530 --> 01:51:39.540 align:start position:0%
own insurance policy that right's not
 
01:51:42.109 --> 01:51:42.119 align:start position:0%
taken away I still have it so I see this
 
01:51:44.629 --> 01:51:44.639 align:start position:0%
is basically interfering with someone's
 
01:51:46.910 --> 01:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
rights based upon the payment method
 
01:51:49.669 --> 01:51:49.679 align:start position:0%
that's in place
 
01:51:52.370 --> 01:51:52.380 align:start position:0%
I could be wrong obviously but I think
 
01:51:53.930 --> 01:51:53.940 align:start position:0%
that once if the vaccine become
 
01:51:55.669 --> 01:51:55.679 align:start position:0%
commercialized down the road and then
 
01:51:57.290 --> 01:51:57.300 align:start position:0%
they start charging insurances maybe
 
01:51:59.209 --> 01:51:59.219 align:start position:0%
that might apply but as of right now
 
01:52:01.970 --> 01:52:01.980 align:start position:0%
we're still under this emergency use
 
01:52:04.070 --> 01:52:04.080 align:start position:0%
so maybe I can listen you're still
 
01:52:05.689 --> 01:52:05.699 align:start position:0%
you're still denying me my rights that's
 
01:52:07.609 --> 01:52:07.619 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to get to to elect the
 
01:52:09.649 --> 01:52:09.659 align:start position:0%
vaccine yes because if someone doesn't
 
01:52:11.689 --> 01:52:11.699 align:start position:0%
pay for it through Medicaid or through
 
01:52:13.550 --> 01:52:13.560 align:start position:0%
the state program and so forth because
 
01:52:14.990 --> 01:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
you're talking about the purchase of it
 
01:52:17.570 --> 01:52:17.580 align:start position:0%
or payment of it my right has been
 
01:52:19.609 --> 01:52:19.619 align:start position:0%
denied because I would have to pay for
 
01:52:21.050 --> 01:52:21.060 align:start position:0%
it out of my own pocket and sometimes I
 
01:52:21.060 --> 01:52:22.189 align:start position:0%
it out of my own pocket and sometimes I
can't

01:52:22.189 --> 01:52:22.199 align:start position:0%
can't
 
01:52:24.410 --> 01:52:24.420 align:start position:0%
I hope we have an expert who can clarify
 
01:52:26.209 --> 01:52:26.219 align:start position:0%
that because I I don't believe you're
 
01:52:28.729 --> 01:52:28.739 align:start position:0%
asked to pay for the covid-19 vaccine
 
01:52:30.470 --> 01:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
when you go to Rite Aid
 
01:52:33.109 --> 01:52:33.119 align:start position:0%
to get it or provide insurance I don't
 
01:52:34.310 --> 01:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
believe that if this doesn't cover
 
01:52:36.410 --> 01:52:36.420 align:start position:0%
strictly covet it covers any vaccine
 
01:52:39.709 --> 01:52:39.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:43.310 --> 01:52:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:44.810 --> 01:52:44.820 align:start position:0%
I'll look into it I don't I don't I'm
 
01:52:46.729 --> 01:52:46.739 align:start position:0%
sorry I don't have the answer
 
01:52:48.050 --> 01:52:48.060 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman and then
 
01:52:49.550 --> 01:52:49.560 align:start position:0%
representative farmer
 
01:52:51.470 --> 01:52:51.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:52:54.050 --> 01:52:54.060 align:start position:0%
um first a clarifying question and then
 
01:52:56.090 --> 01:52:56.100 align:start position:0%
if I could have a follow-up okay
 
01:52:59.510 --> 01:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
um is it it's just the boosters that
 
01:53:01.490 --> 01:53:01.500 align:start position:0%
didn't have human clinical trials
 
01:53:06.770 --> 01:53:06.780 align:start position:0%
correct correct okay and um so
 
01:53:09.770 --> 01:53:09.780 align:start position:0%
my understanding is
 
01:53:12.950 --> 01:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
that the federal government paid for
 
01:53:14.870 --> 01:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
this through the emergency use
 
01:53:18.350 --> 01:53:18.360 align:start position:0%
authorization act and
 
01:53:21.290 --> 01:53:21.300 align:start position:0%
then the states received the vaccine the
 
01:53:23.209 --> 01:53:23.219 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire did not pay for
 
01:53:26.149 --> 01:53:26.159 align:start position:0%
it that itself
 
01:53:28.430 --> 01:53:28.440 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding correct thank
 
01:53:28.440 --> 01:53:29.209 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding correct thank
you

01:53:29.209 --> 01:53:29.219 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:53:31.010 --> 01:53:31.020 align:start position:0%
representative Parma then representative
 
01:53:31.020 --> 01:53:32.450 align:start position:0%
representative Parma then representative
McLean

01:53:32.450 --> 01:53:32.460 align:start position:0%
McLean
 
01:53:34.729 --> 01:53:34.739 align:start position:0%
so I have a sort of two part one is to
 
01:53:36.890 --> 01:53:36.900 align:start position:0%
follow up on uh representative Shapiro
 
01:53:39.370 --> 01:53:39.380 align:start position:0%
which is so Ebola has about a 50
 
01:53:41.149 --> 01:53:41.159 align:start position:0%
fatality rate
 
01:53:43.850 --> 01:53:43.860 align:start position:0%
um would that you know exceed your
 
01:53:45.709 --> 01:53:45.719 align:start position:0%
threshold for like okay whatever we can
 
01:53:47.689 --> 01:53:47.699 align:start position:0%
do we're gonna do
 
01:53:50.330 --> 01:53:50.340 align:start position:0%
um the other thing is if if this is more
 
01:53:52.430 --> 01:53:52.440 align:start position:0%
an issue of consent should the law
 
01:53:55.850 --> 01:53:55.860 align:start position:0%
should this bill be about the state
 
01:53:58.729 --> 01:53:58.739 align:start position:0%
offering informed consent before any
 
01:54:01.430 --> 01:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
vaccine that fits the parameters you're
 
01:54:03.530 --> 01:54:03.540 align:start position:0%
talking about rather than just Banning
 
01:54:06.950 --> 01:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
the state from doing it
 
01:54:08.689 --> 01:54:08.699 align:start position:0%
let's start with your second question so
 
01:54:10.490 --> 01:54:10.500 align:start position:0%
part of informed consent I think we're
 
01:54:12.530 --> 01:54:12.540 align:start position:0%
familiar that these vaccines came with
 
01:54:14.030 --> 01:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
blank inserts so there was no
 
01:54:15.830 --> 01:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
information for the provider let alone
 
01:54:18.890 --> 01:54:18.900 align:start position:0%
the patient to really see the insert on
 
01:54:20.330 --> 01:54:20.340 align:start position:0%
what was even in it so I don't think
 
01:54:23.090 --> 01:54:23.100 align:start position:0%
there was an opportunity for that your
 
01:54:25.310 --> 01:54:25.320 align:start position:0%
first part about ebola I believe they've
 
01:54:27.050 --> 01:54:27.060 align:start position:0%
done human clinical trials on the Ebola
 
01:54:30.590 --> 01:54:30.600 align:start position:0%
vaccine maybe is there a new strain like
 
01:54:32.930 --> 01:54:32.940 align:start position:0%
I'm just asking for that to be tested on
 
01:54:35.390 --> 01:54:35.400 align:start position:0%
humans before the state gets involved
 
01:54:37.070 --> 01:54:37.080 align:start position:0%
with Distributing it
 
01:54:39.590 --> 01:54:39.600 align:start position:0%
so my example of Ebola was not so much
 
01:54:41.270 --> 01:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
whether or not there's a vaccine there
 
01:54:45.109 --> 01:54:45.119 align:start position:0%
but the fatality rate was so high that
 
01:54:47.990 --> 01:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
you in in let's just say it's a new a
 
01:54:50.990 --> 01:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
new a new pandemic with that kind of
 
01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.090 align:start position:0%
new a new pandemic with that kind of
rate

01:54:53.090 --> 01:54:53.100 align:start position:0%
rate
 
01:54:56.570 --> 01:54:56.580 align:start position:0%
um I wouldn't want to see a barrier to
 
01:54:58.129 --> 01:54:58.139 align:start position:0%
treatment because that would be
 
01:55:02.149 --> 01:55:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:04.609 --> 01:55:04.619 align:start position:0%
um I believe that to improve treatment
 
01:55:08.689 --> 01:55:08.699 align:start position:0%
you have to try medicine and have trials
 
01:55:08.699 --> 01:55:10.070 align:start position:0%
you have to try medicine and have trials
so

01:55:10.070 --> 01:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:55:12.649 --> 01:55:12.659 align:start position:0%
I think that there's a divide here in
 
01:55:15.530 --> 01:55:15.540 align:start position:0%
general that vaccines are
 
01:55:17.750 --> 01:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
um without concern to some and that
 
01:55:19.790 --> 01:55:19.800 align:start position:0%
there's no big deal but there are real
 
01:55:22.010 --> 01:55:22.020 align:start position:0%
vaccine injuries so I think that taking
 
01:55:23.810 --> 01:55:23.820 align:start position:0%
a vaccine just in case it might have a
 
01:55:23.820 --> 01:55:25.550 align:start position:0%
a vaccine just in case it might have a
beneficial

01:55:25.550 --> 01:55:25.560 align:start position:0%
beneficial
 
01:55:28.250 --> 01:55:28.260 align:start position:0%
um component to a deadly disease or not
 
01:55:30.229 --> 01:55:30.239 align:start position:0%
that's not something that some people
 
01:55:32.209 --> 01:55:32.219 align:start position:0%
are willing to do or want to do or the
 
01:55:34.129 --> 01:55:34.139 align:start position:0%
state should be involved in
 
01:55:37.070 --> 01:55:37.080 align:start position:0%
okay representative McLean thank you Mr
 
01:55:38.330 --> 01:55:38.340 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:55:38.340 --> 01:55:39.350 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
question

01:55:39.350 --> 01:55:39.360 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:55:43.430 --> 01:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
um you know so absent uh a compelling uh
 
01:55:45.590 --> 01:55:45.600 align:start position:0%
State need which is a very high
 
01:55:47.629 --> 01:55:47.639 align:start position:0%
constitutional buyer
 
01:55:50.149 --> 01:55:50.159 align:start position:0%
um I believe every person every citizen
 
01:55:52.490 --> 01:55:52.500 align:start position:0%
whatever should have the right to do
 
01:55:55.490 --> 01:55:55.500 align:start position:0%
their own risk benefit analysis with
 
01:55:58.669 --> 01:55:58.679 align:start position:0%
respect to a drug so for example
 
01:56:01.250 --> 01:56:01.260 align:start position:0%
um if the zombie apocalypse was to come
 
01:56:03.169 --> 01:56:03.179 align:start position:0%
and they said well we don't have this
 
01:56:05.990 --> 01:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
vaccine tested on humans I would do my
 
01:56:07.850 --> 01:56:07.860 align:start position:0%
risk benefit analysis and probably say
 
01:56:10.310 --> 01:56:10.320 align:start position:0%
I'm going to take that vaccine because I
 
01:56:13.010 --> 01:56:13.020 align:start position:0%
don't want to be a zombie but I think
 
01:56:16.669 --> 01:56:16.679 align:start position:0%
the the the bigger concern I had for me
 
01:56:19.729 --> 01:56:19.739 align:start position:0%
specifically coming out of this pandemic
 
01:56:22.609 --> 01:56:22.619 align:start position:0%
was the fact that it was very hard to do
 
01:56:25.189 --> 01:56:25.199 align:start position:0%
that risk benefit analysis because it
 
01:56:27.410 --> 01:56:27.420 align:start position:0%
was very you know what's real what's not
 
01:56:29.990 --> 01:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
real and I know that many of my
 
01:56:32.090 --> 01:56:32.100 align:start position:0%
colleagues put up peer-reviewed studies
 
01:56:34.970 --> 01:56:34.980 align:start position:0%
out of Europe that were prompt taken
 
01:56:37.970 --> 01:56:37.980 align:start position:0%
down and so that for me was the bigger
 
01:56:40.070 --> 01:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
problem was just that it was hard what
 
01:56:41.570 --> 01:56:41.580 align:start position:0%
is real what is not real what is
 
01:56:44.030 --> 01:56:44.040 align:start position:0%
misinformation what is not and I see the
 
01:56:47.510 --> 01:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
the promote the States involvement in
 
01:56:51.109 --> 01:56:51.119 align:start position:0%
promoting the vaccine as kind of kind of
 
01:56:53.149 --> 01:56:53.159 align:start position:0%
damping down on some of that debate so
 
01:56:55.430 --> 01:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
would you be open to amending the
 
01:56:58.669 --> 01:56:58.679 align:start position:0%
legislation to just removing the
 
01:57:00.410 --> 01:57:00.420 align:start position:0%
promoting part
 
01:57:02.450 --> 01:57:02.460 align:start position:0%
um I think in representative Merchant's
 
01:57:05.689 --> 01:57:05.699 align:start position:0%
point is well taken if we want to
 
01:57:07.609 --> 01:57:07.619 align:start position:0%
get this out as quickly as possible
 
01:57:10.010 --> 01:57:10.020 align:start position:0%
maybe there needs to be some State
 
01:57:12.350 --> 01:57:12.360 align:start position:0%
involvement but I think everybody should
 
01:57:15.830 --> 01:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
have the right to have an informed risk
 
01:57:18.890 --> 01:57:18.900 align:start position:0%
benefit analysis and so I I I would be
 
01:57:21.109 --> 01:57:21.119 align:start position:0%
open to looking at it but just taking
 
01:57:22.970 --> 01:57:22.980 align:start position:0%
out that promotion part so what are your
 
01:57:25.010 --> 01:57:25.020 align:start position:0%
thoughts on that
 
01:57:26.570 --> 01:57:26.580 align:start position:0%
so you want to ban the state from
 
01:57:28.490 --> 01:57:28.500 align:start position:0%
Distributing it or purchasing it or you
 
01:57:30.109 --> 01:57:30.119 align:start position:0%
you just want to keep the promoting part
 
01:57:32.209 --> 01:57:32.219 align:start position:0%
no I I think
 
01:57:34.070 --> 01:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
especially in an emergency like the
 
01:57:36.229 --> 01:57:36.239 align:start position:0%
zombie apocalypse if you want to get
 
01:57:39.050 --> 01:57:39.060 align:start position:0%
something out quickly the state may be
 
01:57:42.770 --> 01:57:42.780 align:start position:0%
the most effective way to do that and so
 
01:57:44.990 --> 01:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
I don't necessarily want to take that
 
01:57:49.070 --> 01:57:49.080 align:start position:0%
you know out of the equation my bare
 
01:57:50.870 --> 01:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
concern as I said people should be able
 
01:57:52.850 --> 01:57:52.860 align:start position:0%
to do their own risk benefit analysis
 
01:57:55.850 --> 01:57:55.860 align:start position:0%
and so when the state actively gets into
 
01:57:59.030 --> 01:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
promoting one side of it that's where I
 
01:58:01.430 --> 01:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
think in this pandemic I I saw them go a
 
01:58:03.410 --> 01:58:03.420 align:start position:0%
little bit over the line and so I would
 
01:58:05.629 --> 01:58:05.639 align:start position:0%
be comfortable taking out the promoting
 
01:58:07.609 --> 01:58:07.619 align:start position:0%
part but I think the other elements of
 
01:58:09.050 --> 01:58:09.060 align:start position:0%
the state they have a role so I just
 
01:58:10.790 --> 01:58:10.800 align:start position:0%
wanted to get your thoughts on that
 
01:58:12.050 --> 01:58:12.060 align:start position:0%
what I'm hearing is that you want to
 
01:58:13.390 --> 01:58:13.400 align:start position:0%
keep the promoting
 
01:58:16.189 --> 01:58:16.199 align:start position:0%
keep the Banning of promoting promoting
 
01:58:18.709 --> 01:58:18.719 align:start position:0%
it yes yes
 
01:58:20.390 --> 01:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
I think that's the most important part
 
01:58:21.950 --> 01:58:21.960 align:start position:0%
because I agree with you if you're if
 
01:58:23.450 --> 01:58:23.460 align:start position:0%
you're getting all your information from
 
01:58:25.729 --> 01:58:25.739 align:start position:0%
the government and in the age of
 
01:58:28.010 --> 01:58:28.020 align:start position:0%
censorship we're not getting like you
 
01:58:30.109 --> 01:58:30.119 align:start position:0%
said access to peer-reviewed studies and
 
01:58:32.330 --> 01:58:32.340 align:start position:0%
whatnot I mean it's it's within the
 
01:58:34.310 --> 01:58:34.320 align:start position:0%
committee's hands to amend it as they
 
01:58:36.649 --> 01:58:36.659 align:start position:0%
see fit um so I think there's
 
01:58:38.629 --> 01:58:38.639 align:start position:0%
improvements in many different areas so
 
01:58:41.149 --> 01:58:41.159 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Leon thank you
 
01:58:43.330 --> 01:58:43.340 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you representative
 
01:58:45.770 --> 01:58:45.780 align:start position:0%
my question comes to the idea of
 
01:58:47.390 --> 01:58:47.400 align:start position:0%
informed consent and our lack of human
 
01:58:51.830 --> 01:58:51.840 align:start position:0%
data my question is if you would be
 
01:58:54.770 --> 01:58:54.780 align:start position:0%
um what you think about the idea of if
 
01:58:57.410 --> 01:58:57.420 align:start position:0%
the state is purchasing and distributing
 
01:58:59.570 --> 01:58:59.580 align:start position:0%
a product that has not been fully tested
 
01:59:02.750 --> 01:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
and especially one where the data can no
 
01:59:04.189 --> 01:59:04.199 align:start position:0%
longer be collected because a crossover
 
01:59:07.910 --> 01:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
effect if the state could instead have a
 
01:59:09.890 --> 01:59:09.900 align:start position:0%
registry program that allows people to
 
01:59:11.870 --> 01:59:11.880 align:start position:0%
either opt-in or opt out and be
 
01:59:13.669 --> 01:59:13.679 align:start position:0%
essentially blinded to the world so that
 
01:59:15.830 --> 01:59:15.840 align:start position:0%
we can actually get some data so that
 
01:59:18.649 --> 01:59:18.659 align:start position:0%
those who want to participate in in a
 
01:59:21.050 --> 01:59:21.060 align:start position:0%
actual clinical research for the benefit
 
01:59:24.050 --> 01:59:24.060 align:start position:0%
of themselves get that and then we avoid
 
01:59:26.330 --> 01:59:26.340 align:start position:0%
the moral issues of having somebody in
 
01:59:27.709 --> 01:59:27.719 align:start position:0%
the control group if they would rather
 
01:59:29.810 --> 01:59:29.820 align:start position:0%
have the treatment what do you think
 
01:59:32.209 --> 01:59:32.219 align:start position:0%
about that
 
01:59:35.570 --> 01:59:35.580 align:start position:0%
normally I'm against Registries but
 
01:59:37.189 --> 01:59:37.199 align:start position:0%
um yeah that's an opportunity for
 
01:59:39.530 --> 01:59:39.540 align:start position:0%
somebody to willingly opt in uh because
 
01:59:41.209 --> 01:59:41.219 align:start position:0%
you're right that clinical trial I keep
 
01:59:42.530 --> 01:59:42.540 align:start position:0%
saying that it's not it's not actually
 
01:59:43.790 --> 01:59:43.800 align:start position:0%
happening anymore because nobody's
 
01:59:46.089 --> 01:59:46.099 align:start position:0%
collecting the data and it's completely
 
01:59:49.010 --> 01:59:49.020 align:start position:0%
muddied the water so yeah I mean I'm I'd
 
01:59:50.750 --> 01:59:50.760 align:start position:0%
be interested in hearing more about it
 
01:59:53.390 --> 01:59:53.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Seth King thank
 
01:59:55.129 --> 01:59:55.139 align:start position:0%
you chairman McDonald and thank you for
 
01:59:56.750 --> 01:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
being here today
 
02:00:00.950 --> 02:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
isn't it true that there is a massive
 
02:00:04.430 --> 02:00:04.440 align:start position:0%
financial interest on behard on behalf
 
02:00:07.430 --> 02:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
of the pharmaceutical companies to get
 
02:00:10.310 --> 02:00:10.320 align:start position:0%
the government to subsidize their the
 
02:00:13.129 --> 02:00:13.139 align:start position:0%
purchasing of their product for every
 
02:00:15.109 --> 02:00:15.119 align:start position:0%
citizen in this country and isn't it
 
02:00:17.149 --> 02:00:17.159 align:start position:0%
true that the pharmaceutical companies
 
02:00:20.270 --> 02:00:20.280 align:start position:0%
made ungodly amounts of money from this
 
02:00:23.149 --> 02:00:23.159 align:start position:0%
pandemic and doesn't that create a moral
 
02:00:25.669 --> 02:00:25.679 align:start position:0%
hazard thank you
 
02:00:25.679 --> 02:00:27.589 align:start position:0%
hazard thank you
yes

02:00:27.589 --> 02:00:27.599 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:00:27.599 --> 02:00:28.669 align:start position:0%
yes
yes

02:00:28.669 --> 02:00:28.679 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:00:28.679 --> 02:00:30.490 align:start position:0%
yes
representative

02:00:30.490 --> 02:00:30.500 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:00:33.229 --> 02:00:33.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Chen thank you for taking
 
02:00:36.530 --> 02:00:36.540 align:start position:0%
my question uh help me understand how
 
02:00:40.870 --> 02:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
this legislation uh Falls uh into
 
02:00:46.430 --> 02:00:46.440 align:start position:0%
current uh legal framework and um I'm
 
02:00:47.870 --> 02:00:47.880 align:start position:0%
kind of surprised by some questions
 
02:00:50.209 --> 02:00:50.219 align:start position:0%
because my understanding we are already
 
02:00:54.250 --> 02:00:54.260 align:start position:0%
deny uh freedom of people when it
 
02:00:59.510 --> 02:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
comes to be financed for some harmful
 
02:01:03.530 --> 02:01:03.540 align:start position:0%
uh drugs or be financed for some drugs
 
02:01:05.589 --> 02:01:05.599 align:start position:0%
that were not
 
02:01:09.470 --> 02:01:09.480 align:start position:0%
scientifically proven to be helpful so
 
02:01:13.870 --> 02:01:13.880 align:start position:0%
and we already have regulations that
 
02:01:16.810 --> 02:01:16.820 align:start position:0%
medication need to be
 
02:01:20.169 --> 02:01:20.179 align:start position:0%
tested including
 
02:01:24.850 --> 02:01:24.860 align:start position:0%
those steps that you outline
 
02:01:28.209 --> 02:01:28.219 align:start position:0%
in this legislation
 
02:01:32.229 --> 02:01:32.239 align:start position:0%
so that fact that
 
02:01:35.410 --> 02:01:35.420 align:start position:0%
boosters did not have the human trial
 
02:01:37.910 --> 02:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
how does it fall with current
 
02:01:41.990 --> 02:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
legislation was was some lost break we
 
02:01:44.510 --> 02:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
can buy that or did we actually need
 
02:01:47.450 --> 02:01:47.460 align:start position:0%
this new legislation to fix this
 
02:01:50.629 --> 02:01:50.639 align:start position:0%
situation thank you
 
02:01:52.129 --> 02:01:52.139 align:start position:0%
I'm probably not the best person to
 
02:01:54.350 --> 02:01:54.360 align:start position:0%
answer the legality of what happened but
 
02:01:56.030 --> 02:01:56.040 align:start position:0%
I think because it's under emergency use
 
02:01:57.770 --> 02:01:57.780 align:start position:0%
authorization what happened obviously
 
02:01:59.629 --> 02:01:59.639 align:start position:0%
it's unprecedented at least in my
 
02:02:02.450 --> 02:02:02.460 align:start position:0%
lifetime so um for this to happen but uh
 
02:02:04.070 --> 02:02:04.080 align:start position:0%
we do have hopefully someone who can
 
02:02:05.930 --> 02:02:05.940 align:start position:0%
hear who could answer this question more
 
02:02:05.940 --> 02:02:07.070 align:start position:0%
hear who could answer this question more
accurately

02:02:07.070 --> 02:02:07.080 align:start position:0%
accurately
 
02:02:07.080 --> 02:02:09.189 align:start position:0%
accurately
um

02:02:09.189 --> 02:02:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:11.030 --> 02:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
I don't
 
02:02:13.850 --> 02:02:13.860 align:start position:0%
I guess I don't have any more things to
 
02:02:15.589 --> 02:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
say about your question I'm sorry thank
 
02:02:17.990 --> 02:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
you all the questions
 
02:02:27.290 --> 02:02:27.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:30.229 --> 02:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak today is a Orion

02:02:41.169 --> 02:02:41.179 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:44.390 --> 02:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
morning gentlemen uh you indicate you
 
02:02:46.189 --> 02:02:46.199 align:start position:0%
need five plus minutes is that combined
 
02:02:48.530 --> 02:02:48.540 align:start position:0%
or or
 
02:02:52.129 --> 02:02:52.139 align:start position:0%
uh we'll try to keep it tonight five
 
02:02:53.450 --> 02:02:53.460 align:start position:0%
plus minutes for the two of you is fine
 
02:02:55.970 --> 02:02:55.980 align:start position:0%
yeah right
 
02:02:58.070 --> 02:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman uh McDonald and
 
02:02:59.390 --> 02:02:59.400 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is Ryan
 
02:03:01.669 --> 02:03:01.679 align:start position:0%
Tanny and I am a registered pharmacist
 
02:03:03.229 --> 02:03:03.239 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire and I'm
 
02:03:04.310 --> 02:03:04.320 align:start position:0%
also the chief of the Bureau of
 
02:03:06.410 --> 02:03:06.420 align:start position:0%
Infectious Disease Control at the
 
02:03:07.930 --> 02:03:07.940 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
02:03:09.830 --> 02:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
Division I'm having a little trouble
 
02:03:11.270 --> 02:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
hearing if you could move the microphone
 
02:03:13.430 --> 02:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
up absolutely sure
 
02:03:13.440 --> 02:03:14.570 align:start position:0%
up absolutely sure
try

02:03:14.570 --> 02:03:14.580 align:start position:0%
try
 
02:03:17.270 --> 02:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
so uh I'm also joined today by Dr
 
02:03:19.250 --> 02:03:19.260 align:start position:0%
Benjamin Chan and infectious disease
 
02:03:20.870 --> 02:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
physician in the New Hampshire State
 
02:03:23.209 --> 02:03:23.219 align:start position:0%
epidemiologist and we're here today to
 
02:03:26.950 --> 02:03:26.960 align:start position:0%
speak in opposition to house bill 575.
 
02:03:29.689 --> 02:03:29.699 align:start position:0%
to begin the wording of this proposed
 
02:03:31.729 --> 02:03:31.739 align:start position:0%
legislation could I just ask if you put
 
02:03:33.410 --> 02:03:33.420 align:start position:0%
it right in front
 
02:03:35.149 --> 02:03:35.159 align:start position:0%
of them sideways they're very
 
02:03:37.010 --> 02:03:37.020 align:start position:0%
directional they don't they don't pick
 
02:03:40.430 --> 02:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
up anything from any other side perfect
 
02:03:42.169 --> 02:03:42.179 align:start position:0%
so we believe the wording of the
 
02:03:44.510 --> 02:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation is both vague in
 
02:03:47.270 --> 02:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
its intent and it's unclear we also
 
02:03:48.770 --> 02:03:48.780 align:start position:0%
believe that there's insufficient
 
02:03:52.669 --> 02:03:52.679 align:start position:0%
insufficient detail to know the intent
 
02:03:55.189 --> 02:03:55.199 align:start position:0%
behind requiring human or voluntary
 
02:03:57.709 --> 02:03:57.719 align:start position:0%
clinical trials there are different
 
02:04:00.229 --> 02:04:00.239 align:start position:0%
types of clinical trials some that study
 
02:04:02.990 --> 02:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
safety some that study Effectiveness and
 
02:04:05.510 --> 02:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
then others that actually do both and
 
02:04:07.250 --> 02:04:07.260 align:start position:0%
then there's also different methods to
 
02:04:10.129 --> 02:04:10.139 align:start position:0%
measure effectiveness of vaccines and
 
02:04:11.990 --> 02:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical products
 
02:04:15.050 --> 02:04:15.060 align:start position:0%
so we also believe that uh there this
 
02:04:16.430 --> 02:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
was brought forth due to concerns
 
02:04:19.070 --> 02:04:19.080 align:start position:0%
related to the covid-19 bivalent vaccine
 
02:04:19.080 --> 02:04:20.990 align:start position:0%
related to the covid-19 bivalent vaccine
formulations

02:04:20.990 --> 02:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
formulations
 
02:04:23.330 --> 02:04:23.340 align:start position:0%
um however this did follow a similar
 
02:04:25.490 --> 02:04:25.500 align:start position:0%
process to our annual influenza
 
02:04:28.370 --> 02:04:28.380 align:start position:0%
vaccinations so a comprehensive
 
02:04:30.649 --> 02:04:30.659 align:start position:0%
collection of this data in the covid-19
 
02:04:33.290 --> 02:04:33.300 align:start position:0%
vaccine safety and Effectiveness studies
 
02:04:36.169 --> 02:04:36.179 align:start position:0%
they were reviewed by the FDA and CDC
 
02:04:38.270 --> 02:04:38.280 align:start position:0%
prior to their release in September of
 
02:04:38.280 --> 02:04:39.890 align:start position:0%
prior to their release in September of
2022

02:04:39.890 --> 02:04:39.900 align:start position:0%
2022
 
02:04:42.290 --> 02:04:42.300 align:start position:0%
and this did include human clinical
 
02:04:44.209 --> 02:04:44.219 align:start position:0%
trials of the previous monovalent
 
02:04:46.669 --> 02:04:46.679 align:start position:0%
vaccine formulations human clinical
 
02:04:48.649 --> 02:04:48.659 align:start position:0%
trials of different bivalent vaccine
 
02:04:51.050 --> 02:04:51.060 align:start position:0%
formulations including beta variant
 
02:04:54.470 --> 02:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
bivalent vaccines and the ba.1 bivalent
 
02:04:54.480 --> 02:04:56.209 align:start position:0%
bivalent vaccines and the ba.1 bivalent
vaccines

02:04:56.209 --> 02:04:56.219 align:start position:0%
vaccines
 
02:04:58.430 --> 02:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
this comprehensive collection of data
 
02:05:00.470 --> 02:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
was also summarized in a New Hampshire
 
02:05:02.930 --> 02:05:02.940 align:start position:0%
science brief that was also published in
 
02:05:05.450 --> 02:05:05.460 align:start position:0%
September of 2022.
 
02:05:07.370 --> 02:05:07.380 align:start position:0%
and then additionally we are unable to
 
02:05:09.350 --> 02:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
identify the intent or reason for the
 
02:05:12.550 --> 02:05:12.560 align:start position:0%
use of the word voluntary as federal law
 
02:05:17.030 --> 02:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
21 CFR section 50.20 prohibits the use
 
02:05:19.129 --> 02:05:19.139 align:start position:0%
of involuntary human subjects in
 
02:05:21.050 --> 02:05:21.060 align:start position:0%
clinical trials as that is considered
 
02:05:21.060 --> 02:05:22.669 align:start position:0%
clinical trials as that is considered
unethical

02:05:22.669 --> 02:05:22.679 align:start position:0%
unethical
 
02:05:25.370 --> 02:05:25.380 align:start position:0%
so because covid-19 vaccines followed a
 
02:05:27.770 --> 02:05:27.780 align:start position:0%
process similar to our annual influenza
 
02:05:27.780 --> 02:05:28.970 align:start position:0%
process similar to our annual influenza
vaccines

02:05:28.970 --> 02:05:28.980 align:start position:0%
vaccines
 
02:05:32.450 --> 02:05:32.460 align:start position:0%
if House Bill 575 is enacted it is
 
02:05:34.669 --> 02:05:34.679 align:start position:0%
likely that the department and our
 
02:05:37.490 --> 02:05:37.500 align:start position:0%
partners would be unable to purchase
 
02:05:39.109 --> 02:05:39.119 align:start position:0%
promote or distribute the annual
 
02:05:41.330 --> 02:05:41.340 align:start position:0%
influenza vaccine and this could
 
02:05:43.310 --> 02:05:43.320 align:start position:0%
negatively impact patients and staff
 
02:05:45.470 --> 02:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
that are in our County nursing homes and
 
02:05:47.810 --> 02:05:47.820 align:start position:0%
Correctional Facilities those at the New
 
02:05:50.209 --> 02:05:50.219 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital Glencliff home and
 
02:05:51.709 --> 02:05:51.719 align:start position:0%
our veterans at the New Hampshire State
 
02:05:53.510 --> 02:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
Veterans Home in Tilton
 
02:05:55.669 --> 02:05:55.679 align:start position:0%
as well as the Manchester and Nashua
 
02:05:57.950 --> 02:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
Public Health departments and this is
 
02:05:59.750 --> 02:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
contrary to the mission of not only
 
02:06:01.669 --> 02:06:01.679 align:start position:0%
these individual organizations but the
 
02:06:03.530 --> 02:06:03.540 align:start position:0%
department as well
 
02:06:06.770 --> 02:06:06.780 align:start position:0%
also depending on how House Bill 575 is
 
02:06:09.530 --> 02:06:09.540 align:start position:0%
interpreted in cases where child and
 
02:06:12.350 --> 02:06:12.360 align:start position:0%
adult vaccines are periodically updated
 
02:06:15.709 --> 02:06:15.719 align:start position:0%
without a new clinical trial this may
 
02:06:17.990 --> 02:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
impact our ability to purchase and
 
02:06:20.089 --> 02:06:20.099 align:start position:0%
distribute other vaccines that prevent
 
02:06:22.189 --> 02:06:22.199 align:start position:0%
life-threatening bacterial infections
 
02:06:24.050 --> 02:06:24.060 align:start position:0%
and an example of this would be the
 
02:06:26.450 --> 02:06:26.460 align:start position:0%
pneumococcal vaccine
 
02:06:28.070 --> 02:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
so we also believe that there would be
 
02:06:30.770 --> 02:06:30.780 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences for our state
 
02:06:32.810 --> 02:06:32.820 align:start position:0%
vaccine for children program which
 
02:06:35.270 --> 02:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
allows us to purchase vaccines on a
 
02:06:37.850 --> 02:06:37.860 align:start position:0%
federal contract at a discounted rate
 
02:06:40.490 --> 02:06:40.500 align:start position:0%
so without this program New Hampshire
 
02:06:42.410 --> 02:06:42.420 align:start position:0%
providers would be forced to purchase
 
02:06:44.689 --> 02:06:44.699 align:start position:0%
the vaccine commercially resulting in
 
02:06:47.629 --> 02:06:47.639 align:start position:0%
higher costs to the health system
 
02:06:50.870 --> 02:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
and then although covid-19 was the
 
02:06:53.570 --> 02:06:53.580 align:start position:0%
leading cause of death by infections and
 
02:06:55.729 --> 02:06:55.739 align:start position:0%
respiratory illnesses in children the
 
02:06:58.070 --> 02:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
department continues to make the
 
02:06:59.750 --> 02:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
statement that we do not intend to make
 
02:07:03.290 --> 02:07:03.300 align:start position:0%
Cova 19 or influenza vaccinations a
 
02:07:05.030 --> 02:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
requirement for school or Child Care
 
02:07:05.040 --> 02:07:06.530 align:start position:0%
requirement for school or Child Care
attendance

02:07:06.530 --> 02:07:06.540 align:start position:0%
attendance
 
02:07:08.270 --> 02:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
and then lastly an additional
 
02:07:12.290 --> 02:07:12.300 align:start position:0%
consequence of House Bill 575 is the
 
02:07:14.870 --> 02:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
potential negative effect it could have
 
02:07:17.810 --> 02:07:17.820 align:start position:0%
on the FDA provision known as expanded
 
02:07:19.609 --> 02:07:19.619 align:start position:0%
access which this is also known as
 
02:07:21.229 --> 02:07:21.239 align:start position:0%
Compassionate Care
 
02:07:23.689 --> 02:07:23.699 align:start position:0%
so Compassionate Care is a mechanism
 
02:07:26.089 --> 02:07:26.099 align:start position:0%
where patients with serious or
 
02:07:27.770 --> 02:07:27.780 align:start position:0%
immediately life-threatening diseases
 
02:07:30.169 --> 02:07:30.179 align:start position:0%
and conditions have access to medical
 
02:07:32.689 --> 02:07:32.699 align:start position:0%
products to include biologics vaccines
 
02:07:35.089 --> 02:07:35.099 align:start position:0%
and other pharmaceutical products which
 
02:07:37.310 --> 02:07:37.320 align:start position:0%
are outside the scope of the clinical
 
02:07:40.010 --> 02:07:40.020 align:start position:0%
trial for which it was designed after
 
02:07:43.010 --> 02:07:43.020 align:start position:0%
they meet certain and strict criteria so
 
02:07:44.990 --> 02:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
these products are undergoing a clinical
 
02:07:47.450 --> 02:07:47.460 align:start position:0%
trial but in Desperate situations and
 
02:07:49.129 --> 02:07:49.139 align:start position:0%
under the compassionate use provision
 
02:07:51.830 --> 02:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
there's usually no other alternative
 
02:07:53.629 --> 02:07:53.639 align:start position:0%
therapy that's available
 
02:07:56.510 --> 02:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
and then this would this is most often
 
02:07:58.550 --> 02:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
seen in patients with conditions such as
 
02:08:02.270 --> 02:08:02.280 align:start position:0%
ALS muscular dystrophy or certain types
 
02:08:03.410 --> 02:08:03.420 align:start position:0%
of cancer
 
02:08:05.570 --> 02:08:05.580 align:start position:0%
so in summary we are opposed to House
 
02:08:07.910 --> 02:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
Bill 575 as we believe the language to
 
02:08:10.070 --> 02:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
be vague and the intent is unclear
 
02:08:13.129 --> 02:08:13.139 align:start position:0%
there's also a robust Federal regulatory
 
02:08:15.050 --> 02:08:15.060 align:start position:0%
process to assess vaccine and
 
02:08:17.149 --> 02:08:17.159 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical product and safety as
 
02:08:19.129 --> 02:08:19.139 align:start position:0%
well as Effectiveness and we believe
 
02:08:20.990 --> 02:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
that this will result in several
 
02:08:23.450 --> 02:08:23.460 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences and it would
 
02:08:25.430 --> 02:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
decrease the access to life-saving
 
02:08:28.669 --> 02:08:28.679 align:start position:0%
vaccines Therapeutics and lead to an
 
02:08:30.709 --> 02:08:30.719 align:start position:0%
increased cost for health care
 
02:08:32.570 --> 02:08:32.580 align:start position:0%
and we will also be submitting written
 
02:08:35.330 --> 02:08:35.340 align:start position:0%
testimony after we stay and answer any
 
02:08:36.589 --> 02:08:36.599 align:start position:0%
questions that the committee may have
 
02:08:41.689 --> 02:08:41.699 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:44.570 --> 02:08:44.580 align:start position:0%
can you hear me okay I can great Mr
 
02:08:46.370 --> 02:08:46.380 align:start position:0%
chair Madam Vice chair members of the
 
02:08:47.810 --> 02:08:47.820 align:start position:0%
committee thank you so much for um
 
02:08:50.030 --> 02:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
taking our testimony today on how spill
 
02:08:52.729 --> 02:08:52.739 align:start position:0%
575 I don't want to take a lot of extra
 
02:08:55.129 --> 02:08:55.139 align:start position:0%
time as Dr tanian just mentioned we will
 
02:08:57.410 --> 02:08:57.420 align:start position:0%
be submitting testimony on this but we
 
02:09:00.410 --> 02:09:00.420 align:start position:0%
have a number of concerns around this
 
02:09:03.109 --> 02:09:03.119 align:start position:0%
legislation what I heard from the
 
02:09:05.629 --> 02:09:05.639 align:start position:0%
sponsor was primarily concern about the
 
02:09:08.450 --> 02:09:08.460 align:start position:0%
covid-19 bivalent formulation of the
 
02:09:11.270 --> 02:09:11.280 align:start position:0%
vaccine and I think I'm happy and we're
 
02:09:14.270 --> 02:09:14.280 align:start position:0%
happy to discuss this the concerns
 
02:09:15.950 --> 02:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
further and take questions during the
 
02:09:17.689 --> 02:09:17.699 align:start position:0%
during the Q a
 
02:09:19.370 --> 02:09:19.380 align:start position:0%
um but do want to just summarize and
 
02:09:21.790 --> 02:09:21.800 align:start position:0%
highlight that the wording in this bill
 
02:09:24.589 --> 02:09:24.599 align:start position:0%
is very Broad
 
02:09:26.930 --> 02:09:26.940 align:start position:0%
um and so that will have likely
 
02:09:29.209 --> 02:09:29.219 align:start position:0%
um a number of unintended consequences
 
02:09:32.750 --> 02:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
on our ability to promote purchase
 
02:09:36.169 --> 02:09:36.179 align:start position:0%
distribute uh other Therapeutics not
 
02:09:38.689 --> 02:09:38.699 align:start position:0%
just vaccines but certainly vaccines are
 
02:09:40.370 --> 02:09:40.380 align:start position:0%
included in this and I think Dr tanyan
 
02:09:42.350 --> 02:09:42.360 align:start position:0%
highlighted the potential impact on
 
02:09:44.810 --> 02:09:44.820 align:start position:0%
influenza vaccine I will say that the
 
02:09:47.930 --> 02:09:47.940 align:start position:0%
annual updated influenza vaccine every
 
02:09:51.890 --> 02:09:51.900 align:start position:0%
year that is well studied and has proven
 
02:09:51.900 --> 02:09:53.169 align:start position:0%
year that is well studied and has proven
safety

02:09:53.169 --> 02:09:53.179 align:start position:0%
safety
 
02:09:56.149 --> 02:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
that goes through a similar process by
 
02:09:58.790 --> 02:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
which the FDA transitioned to the
 
02:10:00.770 --> 02:10:00.780 align:start position:0%
bivalent vaccines rolling out every year
 
02:10:03.229 --> 02:10:03.239 align:start position:0%
and so but it's it's unclear what is
 
02:10:05.870 --> 02:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
intended in the legislation by clinical
 
02:10:11.390 --> 02:10:11.400 align:start position:0%
trials but if the intent is to stop what
 
02:10:13.370 --> 02:10:13.380 align:start position:0%
happened with rollout of the bivalent
 
02:10:16.070 --> 02:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccine that likely will also
 
02:10:18.530 --> 02:10:18.540 align:start position:0%
have implications on our ability to
 
02:10:20.149 --> 02:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
promote distribute purchase other
 
02:10:22.070 --> 02:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
vaccines like the influenza vaccine
 
02:10:24.530 --> 02:10:24.540 align:start position:0%
which doesn't undergo full human
 
02:10:27.169 --> 02:10:27.179 align:start position:0%
clinical trials every year before it is
 
02:10:30.470 --> 02:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
updated and distributed so I do want to
 
02:10:32.390 --> 02:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
try and sort of separate you know the
 
02:10:35.510 --> 02:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
the issues in the wording of the current
 
02:10:38.330 --> 02:10:38.340 align:start position:0%
legislation versus the concern from the
 
02:10:40.790 --> 02:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
Copa 19 bivalent vaccine
 
02:10:42.169 --> 02:10:42.179 align:start position:0%
um but let me stop there because I know
 
02:10:43.550 --> 02:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
that we're over time but we're happy to
 
02:10:45.109 --> 02:10:45.119 align:start position:0%
take questions and expand on it on any
 
02:10:46.370 --> 02:10:46.380 align:start position:0%
of those points thank you all right
 
02:10:51.550 --> 02:10:51.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:54.649 --> 02:10:54.659 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking this question
 
02:10:57.709 --> 02:10:57.719 align:start position:0%
um you know one of the concerns only one
 
02:10:59.750 --> 02:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
of the concerns addressed in the bill
 
02:11:02.209 --> 02:11:02.219 align:start position:0%
and addressed by the sponsor was about
 
02:11:05.990 --> 02:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
informed consent and um you know when I
 
02:11:08.450 --> 02:11:08.460 align:start position:0%
got my first vaccines I
 
02:11:11.149 --> 02:11:11.159 align:start position:0%
drove it was a drive-by with a National
 
02:11:13.609 --> 02:11:13.619 align:start position:0%
Guards person giving me a shot
 
02:11:17.390 --> 02:11:17.400 align:start position:0%
so my question to you is
 
02:11:20.570 --> 02:11:20.580 align:start position:0%
leaving aside some of the other problems
 
02:11:22.790 --> 02:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
in this legislation can do you have
 
02:11:27.169 --> 02:11:27.179 align:start position:0%
ideas about how New Hampshire
 
02:11:30.669 --> 02:11:30.679 align:start position:0%
in the future could have a more robust
 
02:11:34.250 --> 02:11:34.260 align:start position:0%
informed consent process maybe maybe if
 
02:11:36.770 --> 02:11:36.780 align:start position:0%
I can I'll start by answering and see if
 
02:11:39.010 --> 02:11:39.020 align:start position:0%
Dr tanyan has any other comments
 
02:11:41.930 --> 02:11:41.940 align:start position:0%
informed consent happens
 
02:11:45.169 --> 02:11:45.179 align:start position:0%
between a healthcare provider and the
 
02:11:46.850 --> 02:11:46.860 align:start position:0%
patient that's receiving the vaccine
 
02:11:48.910 --> 02:11:48.920 align:start position:0%
from that health care provider
 
02:11:52.370 --> 02:11:52.380 align:start position:0%
so in most of the situations that are
 
02:11:54.229 --> 02:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
being discussed it's not actually
 
02:11:57.470 --> 02:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the Department to obtain
 
02:11:59.270 --> 02:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
informed consent because we're not
 
02:12:01.669 --> 02:12:01.679 align:start position:0%
administering the vaccine to the patient
 
02:12:03.830 --> 02:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
we're not serving as the medical
 
02:12:05.870 --> 02:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
provider if you will to the patient
 
02:12:08.330 --> 02:12:08.340 align:start position:0%
receiving the vaccine now there were
 
02:12:10.310 --> 02:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
situations during the covid-19 pandemic
 
02:12:13.490 --> 02:12:13.500 align:start position:0%
where that did happen as you mentioned
 
02:12:17.270 --> 02:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
the National Guard run Coba 19 Community
 
02:12:20.030 --> 02:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
vaccination clinics were done under
 
02:12:22.070 --> 02:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
medical direction from the Department of
 
02:12:23.470 --> 02:12:23.480 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services
 
02:12:27.109 --> 02:12:27.119 align:start position:0%
there were networks that are Regional
 
02:12:28.910 --> 02:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
public health networks were out doing
 
02:12:31.669 --> 02:12:31.679 align:start position:0%
targeted kova 19 vaccination clinics to
 
02:12:33.410 --> 02:12:33.420 align:start position:0%
for example nursing homes and long-term
 
02:12:35.689 --> 02:12:35.699 align:start position:0%
care facilities and in those situations
 
02:12:38.030 --> 02:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
where we had to stand up those types of
 
02:12:40.250 --> 02:12:40.260 align:start position:0%
mass vaccination clinics those Community
 
02:12:42.470 --> 02:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
vaccination clinics the the department
 
02:12:45.950 --> 02:12:45.960 align:start position:0%
does in emergencies step into the role
 
02:12:48.109 --> 02:12:48.119 align:start position:0%
of serving as that health care provider
 
02:12:49.850 --> 02:12:49.860 align:start position:0%
but that's that's really sort of the
 
02:12:52.990 --> 02:12:53.000 align:start position:0%
rare exception and when we do that
 
02:12:56.450 --> 02:12:56.460 align:start position:0%
we go to Great Lengths to make sure that
 
02:12:58.550 --> 02:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
there is informed consent and there's a
 
02:13:00.530 --> 02:13:00.540 align:start position:0%
whole team teams of people and a whole
 
02:13:02.930 --> 02:13:02.940 align:start position:0%
process by which we do that there was I
 
02:13:06.290 --> 02:13:06.300 align:start position:0%
think a 50 to 60 page protocol which
 
02:13:09.169 --> 02:13:09.179 align:start position:0%
clinics were required to operate under
 
02:13:11.390 --> 02:13:11.400 align:start position:0%
um documents that people were required
 
02:13:14.930 --> 02:13:14.940 align:start position:0%
to sign you know parents that were um
 
02:13:17.450 --> 02:13:17.460 align:start position:0%
you know attending clinics with their
 
02:13:20.930 --> 02:13:20.940 align:start position:0%
children to sign informed consents but
 
02:13:23.270 --> 02:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
when we talk about how the routine
 
02:13:26.089 --> 02:13:26.099 align:start position:0%
delivery of medications and vaccines
 
02:13:26.099 --> 02:13:27.709 align:start position:0%
delivery of medications and vaccines
occurs

02:13:27.709 --> 02:13:27.719 align:start position:0%
occurs
 
02:13:29.330 --> 02:13:29.340 align:start position:0%
um the majority of the time outside of
 
02:13:31.430 --> 02:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
an emergency it's not the department or
 
02:13:32.930 --> 02:13:32.940 align:start position:0%
state government getting informed
 
02:13:35.149 --> 02:13:35.159 align:start position:0%
consent it's informed consent and that
 
02:13:36.770 --> 02:13:36.780 align:start position:0%
situation happens between
 
02:13:39.950 --> 02:13:39.960 align:start position:0%
a provider and the patient in that
 
02:13:42.830 --> 02:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:45.290 --> 02:13:45.300 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you Mr
 
02:13:46.970 --> 02:13:46.980 align:start position:0%
chairman I have two questions one of
 
02:13:49.550 --> 02:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
which is very quick I'm hopeful that I
 
02:13:51.410 --> 02:13:51.420 align:start position:0%
could we could get a list of those
 
02:13:53.089 --> 02:13:53.099 align:start position:0%
vaccines and Therapeutics that would be
 
02:13:55.129 --> 02:13:55.139 align:start position:0%
at risk from this legislation obviously
 
02:13:56.450 --> 02:13:56.460 align:start position:0%
it won't be complete but you already
 
02:13:58.609 --> 02:13:58.619 align:start position:0%
have a good number of them and now my
 
02:14:01.189 --> 02:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
actual real question is around informed
 
02:14:02.169 --> 02:14:02.179 align:start position:0%
consent and there's someone
 
02:14:04.729 --> 02:14:04.739 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding about whether it's a
 
02:14:06.830 --> 02:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
provider-based informed consent in New
 
02:14:09.169 --> 02:14:09.179 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or a patient based and I'm
 
02:14:10.970 --> 02:14:10.980 align:start position:0%
curious as to whether you and the
 
02:14:12.709 --> 02:14:12.719 align:start position:0%
department would support for the future
 
02:14:14.390 --> 02:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
legislation to make it clear that
 
02:14:17.209 --> 02:14:17.219 align:start position:0%
informed consent is based upon that
 
02:14:19.629 --> 02:14:19.639 align:start position:0%
individual that patient or their parent
 
02:14:22.430 --> 02:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
understanding the risks and benefits and
 
02:14:24.470 --> 02:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
making it clear that any any outside
 
02:14:27.550 --> 02:14:27.560 align:start position:0%
force including a risk of losing a job
 
02:14:29.750 --> 02:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
invalidates that consent because that
 
02:14:32.750 --> 02:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
actually is compelling use
 
02:14:34.790 --> 02:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
so maybe I'll respond to your second
 
02:14:36.709 --> 02:14:36.719 align:start position:0%
question first
 
02:14:36.719 --> 02:14:38.149 align:start position:0%
question first
um

02:14:38.149 --> 02:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:40.010 --> 02:14:40.020 align:start position:0%
the and I'm sorry that was a complex
 
02:14:42.950 --> 02:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
question so I I may not be fully um
 
02:14:44.689 --> 02:14:44.699 align:start position:0%
understanding it
 
02:14:47.870 --> 02:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
um but I do want to point out that the
 
02:14:50.209 --> 02:14:50.219 align:start position:0%
the reference earlier to human clinical
 
02:14:53.810 --> 02:14:53.820 align:start position:0%
trials and informed consent for studying
 
02:14:56.930 --> 02:14:56.940 align:start position:0%
vaccines is a very different situation
 
02:15:00.470 --> 02:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
and a very different process uh from a
 
02:15:02.030 --> 02:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
patient coming into the health care
 
02:15:05.149 --> 02:15:05.159 align:start position:0%
setting and choosing to get
 
02:15:08.330 --> 02:15:08.340 align:start position:0%
a vaccine a medication a colonoscopy
 
02:15:11.209 --> 02:15:11.219 align:start position:0%
cancer screening Etc and there are
 
02:15:13.430 --> 02:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
currently medical processes and
 
02:15:16.250 --> 02:15:16.260 align:start position:0%
standards already established by which
 
02:15:18.350 --> 02:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
that occurs you know by which informed
 
02:15:20.629 --> 02:15:20.639 align:start position:0%
consent occurs between a provider and a
 
02:15:23.030 --> 02:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
patient so I I'm not sure that I'm that
 
02:15:24.649 --> 02:15:24.659 align:start position:0%
we're maybe the best
 
02:15:26.810 --> 02:15:26.820 align:start position:0%
Department to address or answer that
 
02:15:26.820 --> 02:15:28.069 align:start position:0%
Department to address or answer that
question

02:15:28.069 --> 02:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:15:30.649 --> 02:15:30.659 align:start position:0%
um but responding to your first question
 
02:15:33.290 --> 02:15:33.300 align:start position:0%
um I we don't have a full list of
 
02:15:36.109 --> 02:15:36.119 align:start position:0%
potential impacts of this legislation in
 
02:15:38.030 --> 02:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
terms of Therapeutics and vaccines and
 
02:15:40.370 --> 02:15:40.380 align:start position:0%
partly that's because the intent of it
 
02:15:42.050 --> 02:15:42.060 align:start position:0%
isn't clear and it's not clear what's
 
02:15:44.089 --> 02:15:44.099 align:start position:0%
meant by you know requiring human
 
02:15:46.490 --> 02:15:46.500 align:start position:0%
clinical trials as Dr tanyon said you
 
02:15:48.109 --> 02:15:48.119 align:start position:0%
know there's different types of clinical
 
02:15:50.330 --> 02:15:50.340 align:start position:0%
trials are we talking about you know
 
02:15:51.890 --> 02:15:51.900 align:start position:0%
randomized double-blinded
 
02:15:53.750 --> 02:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
placebo-controlled clinical trials we're
 
02:15:55.370 --> 02:15:55.380 align:start position:0%
talking about observational clinical
 
02:15:56.750 --> 02:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
trials we're talking about trials that
 
02:15:58.669 --> 02:15:58.679 align:start position:0%
are focused and required to report out
 
02:16:02.149 --> 02:16:02.159 align:start position:0%
on vaccine efficacy or clinical trials
 
02:16:04.189 --> 02:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
looking at immune response or clinical
 
02:16:05.990 --> 02:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
trials looking at safety there's a whole
 
02:16:07.910 --> 02:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
as I'm sure you're you're aware um
 
02:16:09.470 --> 02:16:09.480 align:start position:0%
Madame Vice chair there's a whole range
 
02:16:11.990 --> 02:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
of uh clinical trials and so there's
 
02:16:13.970 --> 02:16:13.980 align:start position:0%
it's very hard to know how this
 
02:16:17.149 --> 02:16:17.159 align:start position:0%
legislation will impact that range of
 
02:16:19.490 --> 02:16:19.500 align:start position:0%
Therapeutics what I can say and what I
 
02:16:20.750 --> 02:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
what I alluded to was the fact that
 
02:16:23.569 --> 02:16:23.579 align:start position:0%
there are vaccines that undergo periodic
 
02:16:25.970 --> 02:16:25.980 align:start position:0%
updates and those are the vaccines in
 
02:16:27.290 --> 02:16:27.300 align:start position:0%
particular that I would have most
 
02:16:29.209 --> 02:16:29.219 align:start position:0%
concern about so we saw that of course
 
02:16:31.250 --> 02:16:31.260 align:start position:0%
with the kova 19 bivalent vaccine where
 
02:16:33.950 --> 02:16:33.960 align:start position:0%
the strain was updated we referenced the
 
02:16:35.750 --> 02:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
influenza vaccine where the influenza
 
02:16:38.030 --> 02:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
vaccine gets updated every year the
 
02:16:40.669 --> 02:16:40.679 align:start position:0%
formulation doesn't change but there's a
 
02:16:42.770 --> 02:16:42.780 align:start position:0%
tweak to the strain of virus that's
 
02:16:45.530 --> 02:16:45.540 align:start position:0%
covered so it's not really a new vaccine
 
02:16:47.450 --> 02:16:47.460 align:start position:0%
it's an update or a tweak to an existing
 
02:16:50.089 --> 02:16:50.099 align:start position:0%
vaccine but this also occurs in some of
 
02:16:52.629 --> 02:16:52.639 align:start position:0%
for example the pneumococcal vaccines
 
02:16:55.150 --> 02:16:55.160 align:start position:0%
Pneumovax prevnar
 
02:16:58.330 --> 02:16:58.340 align:start position:0%
for some brand names where over time
 
02:17:00.469 --> 02:17:00.479 align:start position:0%
there are additional
 
02:17:00.479 --> 02:17:01.370 align:start position:0%
there are additional
um

02:17:01.370 --> 02:17:01.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:03.410 --> 02:17:03.420 align:start position:0%
formulations inclusions of different
 
02:17:05.389 --> 02:17:05.399 align:start position:0%
strains of the bacteria that are
 
02:17:07.070 --> 02:17:07.080 align:start position:0%
included in the vaccine that get updated
 
02:17:09.709 --> 02:17:09.719 align:start position:0%
and there aren't necessarily you know
 
02:17:13.009 --> 02:17:13.019 align:start position:0%
full you know vaccine efficacy trials
 
02:17:14.690 --> 02:17:14.700 align:start position:0%
what oftentimes happens with some of
 
02:17:15.950 --> 02:17:15.960 align:start position:0%
these updates is that they compare
 
02:17:19.129 --> 02:17:19.139 align:start position:0%
antibody response right they they infer
 
02:17:22.730 --> 02:17:22.740 align:start position:0%
vaccine efficacy by looking at antibody
 
02:17:24.950 --> 02:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
response from to the new vaccine
 
02:17:26.810 --> 02:17:26.820 align:start position:0%
compared to the old vaccine and so so
 
02:17:28.910 --> 02:17:28.920 align:start position:0%
the impact of this largely depends on
 
02:17:31.910 --> 02:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
what's meant by human clinical trials an
 
02:17:35.570 --> 02:17:35.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:39.889 --> 02:17:39.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:41.629 --> 02:17:41.639 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
02:17:43.910 --> 02:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking the question
 
02:17:46.790 --> 02:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
how would this impact off-label use of a
 
02:17:49.370 --> 02:17:49.380 align:start position:0%
vaccine a lot of times operable use does
 
02:17:52.429 --> 02:17:52.439 align:start position:0%
not go through clinical trials so the
 
02:17:54.709 --> 02:17:54.719 align:start position:0%
way it's written here would that impact
 
02:17:57.349 --> 02:17:57.359 align:start position:0%
the ability for a provider to use the
 
02:18:00.889 --> 02:18:00.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:02.150 --> 02:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:18:04.669 --> 02:18:04.679 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant that was a
 
02:18:08.150 --> 02:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
concern however again where the intent
 
02:18:10.669 --> 02:18:10.679 align:start position:0%
and scope of this legislation is as
 
02:18:10.679 --> 02:18:11.770 align:start position:0%
and scope of this legislation is as
written

02:18:11.770 --> 02:18:11.780 align:start position:0%
written
 
02:18:15.230 --> 02:18:15.240 align:start position:0%
we we do fear that it could be open for
 
02:18:18.830 --> 02:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
interpretation it we sort of touched
 
02:18:20.570 --> 02:18:20.580 align:start position:0%
upon that when we discussed the FDA
 
02:18:23.629 --> 02:18:23.639 align:start position:0%
compassionate use provision there you
 
02:18:25.129 --> 02:18:25.139 align:start position:0%
know as we know there's nothing to
 
02:18:26.810 --> 02:18:26.820 align:start position:0%
prohibit a provider from writing
 
02:18:29.230 --> 02:18:29.240 align:start position:0%
something from uh from an off-label use
 
02:18:32.270 --> 02:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
and to just you know briefly touch upon
 
02:18:34.310 --> 02:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
the previous topic of informed consent
 
02:18:36.709 --> 02:18:36.719 align:start position:0%
there you know again speaking
 
02:18:38.570 --> 02:18:38.580 align:start position:0%
specifically to perhaps the the
 
02:18:40.969 --> 02:18:40.979 align:start position:0%
profession of Pharmacy where under RSA
 
02:18:44.270 --> 02:18:44.280 align:start position:0%
318 and other administrative rules
 
02:18:47.929 --> 02:18:47.939 align:start position:0%
um you know there there is a process for
 
02:18:50.030 --> 02:18:50.040 align:start position:0%
instance when someone is receiving a
 
02:18:51.589 --> 02:18:51.599 align:start position:0%
medication or a vaccine in the pharmacy
 
02:18:54.469 --> 02:18:54.479 align:start position:0%
setting by law the they are supposed to
 
02:18:56.570 --> 02:18:56.580 align:start position:0%
be offered the opportunity to receive
 
02:18:59.089 --> 02:18:59.099 align:start position:0%
counseling from from a pharmacist and
 
02:19:01.310 --> 02:19:01.320 align:start position:0%
the patient does have the ability to to
 
02:19:03.230 --> 02:19:03.240 align:start position:0%
accept or decline that and that is just
 
02:19:05.750 --> 02:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
another opportunity or touch point where
 
02:19:08.270 --> 02:19:08.280 align:start position:0%
that health care provider and patient
 
02:19:10.969 --> 02:19:10.979 align:start position:0%
have that opportunity to discuss and
 
02:19:12.469 --> 02:19:12.479 align:start position:0%
make that determination regarding
 
02:19:12.479 --> 02:19:13.490 align:start position:0%
make that determination regarding
consent

02:19:13.490 --> 02:19:13.500 align:start position:0%
consent
 
02:19:16.370 --> 02:19:16.380 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Weber
 
02:19:17.929 --> 02:19:17.939 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:19:20.509 --> 02:19:20.519 align:start position:0%
aren't we making things a little too
 
02:19:23.089 --> 02:19:23.099 align:start position:0%
simplistic when we only look at the
 
02:19:27.169 --> 02:19:27.179 align:start position:0%
rights of the person who is receiving
 
02:19:30.049 --> 02:19:30.059 align:start position:0%
the vaccine and there's all the
 
02:19:32.509 --> 02:19:32.519 align:start position:0%
questions about voluntary involuntary
 
02:19:34.190 --> 02:19:34.200 align:start position:0%
and how much information they've got
 
02:19:38.650 --> 02:19:38.660 align:start position:0%
which is very important but are we not
 
02:19:38.660 --> 02:19:40.209 align:start position:0%
which is very important but are we not
also

02:19:40.209 --> 02:19:40.219 align:start position:0%
also
 
02:19:43.250 --> 02:19:43.260 align:start position:0%
neglecting particularly when we're
 
02:19:44.929 --> 02:19:44.939 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
02:19:44.939 --> 02:19:46.429 align:start position:0%
talking about
um

02:19:46.429 --> 02:19:46.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:48.950 --> 02:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
the cases in which there is a job
 
02:19:52.250 --> 02:19:52.260 align:start position:0%
requirement for example that we are
 
02:19:56.690 --> 02:19:56.700 align:start position:0%
balancing the right of one person not to
 
02:19:59.570 --> 02:19:59.580 align:start position:0%
receive a treatment that they do not
 
02:20:01.730 --> 02:20:01.740 align:start position:0%
believe is going to be helpful or
 
02:20:05.270 --> 02:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
effective for them with the rights of
 
02:20:07.389 --> 02:20:07.399 align:start position:0%
another person
 
02:20:11.929 --> 02:20:11.939 align:start position:0%
who might very well suffer Health
 
02:20:11.939 --> 02:20:13.790 align:start position:0%
who might very well suffer Health
consequences

02:20:13.790 --> 02:20:13.800 align:start position:0%
consequences
 
02:20:16.130 --> 02:20:16.140 align:start position:0%
from coming in contact with an
 
02:20:19.190 --> 02:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated person and isn't it true
 
02:20:22.969 --> 02:20:22.979 align:start position:0%
that we have to both of those rights are
 
02:20:26.450 --> 02:20:26.460 align:start position:0%
deeply personal and fundamental and that
 
02:20:28.910 --> 02:20:28.920 align:start position:0%
we need to find the appropriate balance
 
02:20:33.010 --> 02:20:33.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:36.110 --> 02:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
yeah so so I agree with you and I think
 
02:20:38.030 --> 02:20:38.040 align:start position:0%
that that what you're expressing is
 
02:20:39.830 --> 02:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
exactly what public health tries to do
 
02:20:41.270 --> 02:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
we look out for the health and the
 
02:20:43.490 --> 02:20:43.500 align:start position:0%
well-being not just of individuals
 
02:20:45.050 --> 02:20:45.060 align:start position:0%
although that's the case as well but
 
02:20:46.849 --> 02:20:46.859 align:start position:0%
also communities however you define
 
02:20:48.590 --> 02:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
Community whether it's a school
 
02:20:51.110 --> 02:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
Community or a business Community or the
 
02:20:53.270 --> 02:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
population of a state or a region
 
02:20:54.889 --> 02:20:54.899 align:start position:0%
um you know I think our our comments and
 
02:20:57.710 --> 02:20:57.720 align:start position:0%
our Focus here um in the testimony has
 
02:20:57.720 --> 02:20:58.730 align:start position:0%
our Focus here um in the testimony has
been

02:20:58.730 --> 02:20:58.740 align:start position:0%
been
 
02:21:00.889 --> 02:21:00.899 align:start position:0%
um more you know because of the the
 
02:21:03.590 --> 02:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
wording of House Bill seven excuse me
 
02:21:03.600 --> 02:21:05.690 align:start position:0%
wording of House Bill seven excuse me
575.

02:21:05.690 --> 02:21:05.700 align:start position:0%
575.
 
02:21:07.190 --> 02:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
um you know the focus of that really is
 
02:21:08.630 --> 02:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
is on
 
02:21:11.150 --> 02:21:11.160 align:start position:0%
um government's ability to distribute
 
02:21:13.730 --> 02:21:13.740 align:start position:0%
promote purchase vaccine but but I do
 
02:21:15.469 --> 02:21:15.479 align:start position:0%
think it's an important point that it's
 
02:21:18.410 --> 02:21:18.420 align:start position:0%
not just government you know one of the
 
02:21:20.150 --> 02:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
other areas where the the wording is a
 
02:21:21.830 --> 02:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
little bit vague is that you know this
 
02:21:23.510 --> 02:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
isn't just state government this this
 
02:21:25.070 --> 02:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
bill and the implications of this bill
 
02:21:28.130 --> 02:21:28.140 align:start position:0%
would also extend to County cities towns
 
02:21:30.830 --> 02:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
water districts school districts uh
 
02:21:32.809 --> 02:21:32.819 align:start position:0%
school administrative units and other as
 
02:21:35.510 --> 02:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
I public entities and so this
 
02:21:37.090 --> 02:21:37.100 align:start position:0%
potentially not only
 
02:21:39.889 --> 02:21:39.899 align:start position:0%
potentially has broad reaching
 
02:21:42.410 --> 02:21:42.420 align:start position:0%
implications for other Community
 
02:21:45.170 --> 02:21:45.180 align:start position:0%
Partners which are also trying to look
 
02:21:46.610 --> 02:21:46.620 align:start position:0%
out exactly for for what you're saying
 
02:21:48.290 --> 02:21:48.300 align:start position:0%
that the health of the health of the
 
02:21:49.969 --> 02:21:49.979 align:start position:0%
community and not necessarily just the
 
02:21:49.979 --> 02:21:52.849 align:start position:0%
community and not necessarily just the
individual

02:21:52.849 --> 02:21:52.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:54.889 --> 02:21:54.899 align:start position:0%
nice representative King
 
02:21:56.870 --> 02:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman McDonald and thank
 
02:21:59.150 --> 02:21:59.160 align:start position:0%
the two of you for being here today I
 
02:22:01.010 --> 02:22:01.020 align:start position:0%
really appreciate your testimony I think
 
02:22:02.450 --> 02:22:02.460 align:start position:0%
you guys brought some excellent balance
 
02:22:04.370 --> 02:22:04.380 align:start position:0%
to the conversation
 
02:22:04.380 --> 02:22:05.870 align:start position:0%
to the conversation
um

02:22:05.870 --> 02:22:05.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:08.450 --> 02:22:08.460 align:start position:0%
I I hope you can help help me and uh
 
02:22:10.910 --> 02:22:10.920 align:start position:0%
understand what's going on so
 
02:22:12.950 --> 02:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
um we have a bunch of other not just
 
02:22:14.330 --> 02:22:14.340 align:start position:0%
this vaccine but a bunch of other
 
02:22:16.849 --> 02:22:16.859 align:start position:0%
vaccines and Therapeutics that currently
 
02:22:19.490 --> 02:22:19.500 align:start position:0%
all the time are being given to people
 
02:22:20.809 --> 02:22:20.819 align:start position:0%
to patients
 
02:22:22.429 --> 02:22:22.439 align:start position:0%
um some of which are you know they've
 
02:22:24.889 --> 02:22:24.899 align:start position:0%
got nothing left to lose and
 
02:22:27.469 --> 02:22:27.479 align:start position:0%
um and that goes on all the time
 
02:22:29.389 --> 02:22:29.399 align:start position:0%
my question for you is and I've got a
 
02:22:32.510 --> 02:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
follow-up my question for you is
 
02:22:34.730 --> 02:22:34.740 align:start position:0%
who is currently making the decisions
 
02:22:36.370 --> 02:22:36.380 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's
 
02:22:38.990 --> 02:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
a bureaucracy right that makes the
 
02:22:41.809 --> 02:22:41.819 align:start position:0%
decisions on which Therapeutics or
 
02:22:44.929 --> 02:22:44.939 align:start position:0%
vaccines that they choose to promote
 
02:22:47.630 --> 02:22:47.640 align:start position:0%
purchase distribute
 
02:22:47.640 --> 02:22:48.349 align:start position:0%
purchase distribute
um

02:22:48.349 --> 02:22:48.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:50.090 --> 02:22:50.100 align:start position:0%
and there's others there's got to be
 
02:22:53.750 --> 02:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
other Therapeutics and such that some
 
02:22:55.730 --> 02:22:55.740 align:start position:0%
bureaucrat or some bureaucracy is saying
 
02:22:57.590 --> 02:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
nah we're not going to buy that we're
 
02:22:59.510 --> 02:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
not going to We're Not Gonna promote
 
02:23:02.750 --> 02:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
that so my my first question is who's
 
02:23:05.330 --> 02:23:05.340 align:start position:0%
making the decisions on which ones to
 
02:23:08.389 --> 02:23:08.399 align:start position:0%
promote and purchase and such
 
02:23:10.429 --> 02:23:10.439 align:start position:0%
yeah so so maybe I'll start again and
 
02:23:12.290 --> 02:23:12.300 align:start position:0%
see if Dr Tanya wants to comment but I I
 
02:23:14.150 --> 02:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
think your your point is well taken that
 
02:23:15.230 --> 02:23:15.240 align:start position:0%
you know it's not the New Hampshire
 
02:23:16.969 --> 02:23:16.979 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
02:23:19.370 --> 02:23:19.380 align:start position:0%
or New Hampshire state government which
 
02:23:22.790 --> 02:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
is approving and authorizing
 
02:23:26.929 --> 02:23:26.939 align:start position:0%
um these you know any therapeutic that I
 
02:23:28.550 --> 02:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
can think of any vaccine and any
 
02:23:28.560 --> 02:23:29.809 align:start position:0%
can think of any vaccine and any
medication

02:23:29.809 --> 02:23:29.819 align:start position:0%
medication
 
02:23:31.070 --> 02:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
um and I think the larger Point here is
 
02:23:34.070 --> 02:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
that there is a federal process that
 
02:23:35.510 --> 02:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
we've seen play out with the kova 19
 
02:23:37.429 --> 02:23:37.439 align:start position:0%
vaccines but there's a federal process
 
02:23:38.929 --> 02:23:38.939 align:start position:0%
by which there you know that there's
 
02:23:42.230 --> 02:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
requirements on the part of the FDA uh
 
02:23:44.990 --> 02:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
the U.S federal drug uh Food and Drug
 
02:23:47.630 --> 02:23:47.640 align:start position:0%
Administration to ensure that there are
 
02:23:49.490 --> 02:23:49.500 align:start position:0%
requirements in place for pharmaceutical
 
02:23:51.650 --> 02:23:51.660 align:start position:0%
companies that develop vaccines to study
 
02:23:53.510 --> 02:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
them appropriately so that they're shown
 
02:23:56.270 --> 02:23:56.280 align:start position:0%
to be safe and effective but even you
 
02:23:58.250 --> 02:23:58.260 align:start position:0%
know approval or authorization on the
 
02:23:59.990 --> 02:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
part of the FDA
 
02:24:01.849 --> 02:24:01.859 align:start position:0%
um isn't the only
 
02:24:04.309 --> 02:24:04.319 align:start position:0%
check and balance so to speak those
 
02:24:06.290 --> 02:24:06.300 align:start position:0%
vaccines if we're talking about vaccines
 
02:24:08.210 --> 02:24:08.220 align:start position:0%
then goes to
 
02:24:10.490 --> 02:24:10.500 align:start position:0%
um you know the CDC and the advisory
 
02:24:12.710 --> 02:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
committee and immunization practices to
 
02:24:15.889 --> 02:24:15.899 align:start position:0%
make clinical recommendations so I think
 
02:24:17.030 --> 02:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
the point is that there's a whole
 
02:24:19.969 --> 02:24:19.979 align:start position:0%
Federal process by which these vaccines
 
02:24:22.370 --> 02:24:22.380 align:start position:0%
and these Therapeutics get reviewed and
 
02:24:24.469 --> 02:24:24.479 align:start position:0%
or recommended
 
02:24:27.290 --> 02:24:27.300 align:start position:0%
um and then there are National medical
 
02:24:29.630 --> 02:24:29.640 align:start position:0%
organizations which also put out
 
02:24:32.270 --> 02:24:32.280 align:start position:0%
clinical guidelines
 
02:24:35.630 --> 02:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
um and so at a state level that's not
 
02:24:37.550 --> 02:24:37.560 align:start position:0%
that's not our role we don't approve we
 
02:24:40.670 --> 02:24:40.680 align:start position:0%
don't authorize vaccines what we do do
 
02:24:43.809 --> 02:24:43.819 align:start position:0%
however is we ensure that um
 
02:24:45.469 --> 02:24:45.479 align:start position:0%
particularly in the case of something
 
02:24:47.510 --> 02:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
like a pandemic in the covid-19 vaccines
 
02:24:50.030 --> 02:24:50.040 align:start position:0%
we do review the science we do make sure
 
02:24:52.670 --> 02:24:52.680 align:start position:0%
that they are safe and that they are
 
02:24:54.469 --> 02:24:54.479 align:start position:0%
shown to be effective and that's part of
 
02:24:55.490 --> 02:24:55.500 align:start position:0%
the reason there were a lot of questions
 
02:24:57.530 --> 02:24:57.540 align:start position:0%
coming in about the covid-19 vaccines
 
02:24:58.790 --> 02:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
and that's part of the reason that we
 
02:25:01.010 --> 02:25:01.020 align:start position:0%
put together that Dr tanian mentioned
 
02:25:03.830 --> 02:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
this New Hampshire science brief so that
 
02:25:03.840 --> 02:25:04.929 align:start position:0%
this New Hampshire science brief so that
our

02:25:04.929 --> 02:25:04.939 align:start position:0%
our
 
02:25:07.250 --> 02:25:07.260 align:start position:0%
communities could be reassured that we
 
02:25:09.290 --> 02:25:09.300 align:start position:0%
were in fact reviewing and looking at
 
02:25:11.630 --> 02:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
the science around the bivalent Copa 19
 
02:25:14.450 --> 02:25:14.460 align:start position:0%
vaccines okay follow-up follow-up I
 
02:25:15.770 --> 02:25:15.780 align:start position:0%
appreciate your response although I'm
 
02:25:17.510 --> 02:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
not sure it really addressed my issue
 
02:25:18.710 --> 02:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
and that is
 
02:25:21.050 --> 02:25:21.060 align:start position:0%
when there's a therapeutic of any kind
 
02:25:24.650 --> 02:25:24.660 align:start position:0%
forget vaccine just therapeutic it's not
 
02:25:28.190 --> 02:25:28.200 align:start position:0%
it's not Vice chair Leon or chairman
 
02:25:29.929 --> 02:25:29.939 align:start position:0%
McDonald who says this is this is
 
02:25:31.370 --> 02:25:31.380 align:start position:0%
something I want to do and we're going
 
02:25:32.690 --> 02:25:32.700 align:start position:0%
to promote it and we're going to buy it
 
02:25:34.550 --> 02:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
and we're going to let the patients get
 
02:25:37.190 --> 02:25:37.200 align:start position:0%
it somebody is making the decision to
 
02:25:38.630 --> 02:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
finally say yeah we're going to promote
 
02:25:40.910 --> 02:25:40.920 align:start position:0%
it we're going to buy it that the only
 
02:25:43.010 --> 02:25:43.020 align:start position:0%
person or people or group of people I
 
02:25:45.050 --> 02:25:45.060 align:start position:0%
can think of are bureaucracies and
 
02:25:46.610 --> 02:25:46.620 align:start position:0%
bureaucrats they're the only ones that
 
02:25:48.830 --> 02:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day or if my
 
02:25:50.030 --> 02:25:50.040 align:start position:0%
understanding is correct that are going
 
02:25:51.230 --> 02:25:51.240 align:start position:0%
to say yeah this is something we're
 
02:25:52.610 --> 02:25:52.620 align:start position:0%
going to do here
 
02:25:54.950 --> 02:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:25:58.010 --> 02:25:58.020 align:start position:0%
I guess the concern I have is
 
02:25:59.809 --> 02:25:59.819 align:start position:0%
so for example you have what's known as
 
02:26:01.670 --> 02:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
regulatory capture where
 
02:26:04.309 --> 02:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
the the the regulatory body that is
 
02:26:07.130 --> 02:26:07.140 align:start position:0%
meant to you know protect the public
 
02:26:10.309 --> 02:26:10.319 align:start position:0%
from say the pharmaceutical industry
 
02:26:12.710 --> 02:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
they end up being populated with people
 
02:26:14.330 --> 02:26:14.340 align:start position:0%
that used to work for the pharmaceutical
 
02:26:15.950 --> 02:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
industry and it's sort of a revolving
 
02:26:18.710 --> 02:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
door and it's like the chicken and the
 
02:26:20.330 --> 02:26:20.340 align:start position:0%
head you know the the fox guarding the
 
02:26:22.969 --> 02:26:22.979 align:start position:0%
hen house and I'm just curious how we as
 
02:26:22.979 --> 02:26:24.130 align:start position:0%
hen house and I'm just curious how we as
as

02:26:24.130 --> 02:26:24.140 align:start position:0%
as
 
02:26:26.510 --> 02:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
representatives of the people can
 
02:26:29.870 --> 02:26:29.880 align:start position:0%
provide oversight over over this whole
 
02:26:31.849 --> 02:26:31.859 align:start position:0%
system when because right now it just
 
02:26:34.010 --> 02:26:34.020 align:start position:0%
feels like the bureaucrats have a blank
 
02:26:36.050 --> 02:26:36.060 align:start position:0%
check to to make total unilateral
 
02:26:38.690 --> 02:26:38.700 align:start position:0%
decisions and I don't feel like there's
 
02:26:41.090 --> 02:26:41.100 align:start position:0%
any input from we the people so can you
 
02:26:42.410 --> 02:26:42.420 align:start position:0%
just explain that a little bit thank you
 
02:26:44.870 --> 02:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
so so two comments and I'll try to make
 
02:26:46.610 --> 02:26:46.620 align:start position:0%
these more direct first you know I don't
 
02:26:49.130 --> 02:26:49.140 align:start position:0%
think we generally recommend legislating
 
02:26:51.230 --> 02:26:51.240 align:start position:0%
Medical Care and so when you're talking
 
02:26:51.240 --> 02:26:52.309 align:start position:0%
Medical Care and so when you're talking
about

02:26:52.309 --> 02:26:52.319 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:26:54.050 --> 02:26:54.060 align:start position:0%
um you know vaccines Therapeutics
 
02:26:57.290 --> 02:26:57.300 align:start position:0%
whatever the pharmaceutical therapeutic
 
02:26:58.969 --> 02:26:58.979 align:start position:0%
is you're talking about essentially
 
02:27:02.750 --> 02:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
delivery of that in a healthcare setting
 
02:27:05.090 --> 02:27:05.100 align:start position:0%
um there's always dangers with that
 
02:27:06.590 --> 02:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
um the second comment I would have is
 
02:27:09.530 --> 02:27:09.540 align:start position:0%
that there is a federal system or
 
02:27:12.110 --> 02:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy maybe as you put it
 
02:27:14.950 --> 02:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
um that initially assesses and evaluates
 
02:27:17.030 --> 02:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
Therapeutics to see if they're safe and
 
02:27:20.030 --> 02:27:20.040 align:start position:0%
effective to make them available but
 
02:27:22.630 --> 02:27:22.640 align:start position:0%
then there's a Whole Net medical
 
02:27:25.790 --> 02:27:25.800 align:start position:0%
professional network of
 
02:27:28.849 --> 02:27:28.859 align:start position:0%
um of medical providers Professional
 
02:27:32.330 --> 02:27:32.340 align:start position:0%
Medical organizations which assess and
 
02:27:32.340 --> 02:27:33.710 align:start position:0%
Medical organizations which assess and
recommend

02:27:33.710 --> 02:27:33.720 align:start position:0%
recommend
 
02:27:36.650 --> 02:27:36.660 align:start position:0%
you know how that therapeutic should be
 
02:27:39.410 --> 02:27:39.420 align:start position:0%
used at the at the patient level so it's
 
02:27:41.330 --> 02:27:41.340 align:start position:0%
really sort of a multi-tier system you
 
02:27:43.309 --> 02:27:43.319 align:start position:0%
know the bureaucracy if you will that I
 
02:27:45.889 --> 02:27:45.899 align:start position:0%
think the public oftentimes sees is you
 
02:27:48.290 --> 02:27:48.300 align:start position:0%
know for example the FDA uh reviewing
 
02:27:50.150 --> 02:27:50.160 align:start position:0%
and approving a therapeutic or a
 
02:27:52.190 --> 02:27:52.200 align:start position:0%
medication but then what happens is that
 
02:27:53.809 --> 02:27:53.819 align:start position:0%
there's an assessment about how that
 
02:27:55.670 --> 02:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
medication or that therapeutic is
 
02:27:58.730 --> 02:27:58.740 align:start position:0%
appropriately appropriately used at a
 
02:28:00.469 --> 02:28:00.479 align:start position:0%
clinical level
 
02:28:02.770 --> 02:28:02.780 align:start position:0%
um and that's where non-governmental
 
02:28:05.210 --> 02:28:05.220 align:start position:0%
groups come in
 
02:28:05.220 --> 02:28:06.170 align:start position:0%
groups come in
um

02:28:06.170 --> 02:28:06.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:07.910 --> 02:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
you know so for example when you're
 
02:28:10.070 --> 02:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
talking about you know covid-19 and
 
02:28:12.590 --> 02:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
treating kova 19 there are professional
 
02:28:14.330 --> 02:28:14.340 align:start position:0%
medical societies like the Infectious
 
02:28:16.070 --> 02:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
Disease Society of America for example
 
02:28:18.170 --> 02:28:18.180 align:start position:0%
or idsa which weighs in and has
 
02:28:20.150 --> 02:28:20.160 align:start position:0%
recommendations on how to appropriately
 
02:28:25.510 --> 02:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:27.950 --> 02:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
if I may add to that uh representative
 
02:28:30.410 --> 02:28:30.420 align:start position:0%
King one of the outcomes of the previous
 
02:28:32.630 --> 02:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
legislative session was the passage of
 
02:28:35.929 --> 02:28:35.939 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1045 which established a
 
02:28:38.990 --> 02:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
ethics advisory committee and that
 
02:28:41.030 --> 02:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
committee also includes members of the
 
02:28:43.670 --> 02:28:43.680 align:start position:0%
House and Senate and they are there to
 
02:28:46.910 --> 02:28:46.920 align:start position:0%
as well as other stakeholders as well to
 
02:28:48.650 --> 02:28:48.660 align:start position:0%
advise the commissioner in the
 
02:28:52.370 --> 02:28:52.380 align:start position:0%
department on matters such as this
 
02:28:55.490 --> 02:28:55.500 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative Nagel
 
02:28:57.469 --> 02:28:57.479 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thanks for taking
 
02:29:00.110 --> 02:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
my question I this is a fairly maybe not
 
02:29:00.120 --> 02:29:01.490 align:start position:0%
my question I this is a fairly maybe not
simple

02:29:01.490 --> 02:29:01.500 align:start position:0%
simple
 
02:29:03.349 --> 02:29:03.359 align:start position:0%
um we had heard an earlier testimony
 
02:29:05.450 --> 02:29:05.460 align:start position:0%
from somebody else that there is no
 
02:29:07.429 --> 02:29:07.439 align:start position:0%
ongoing effort to assess risk and
 
02:29:11.030 --> 02:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
benefit of these vaccines is that true
 
02:29:13.130 --> 02:29:13.140 align:start position:0%
um and what is actually being done and
 
02:29:15.650 --> 02:29:15.660 align:start position:0%
third how would a provider report uh
 
02:29:18.290 --> 02:29:18.300 align:start position:0%
adverse effects yeah so so that is that
 
02:29:21.590 --> 02:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
is not true there is ongoing multiple
 
02:29:23.450 --> 02:29:23.460 align:start position:0%
trials and I would lump them into two
 
02:29:26.330 --> 02:29:26.340 align:start position:0%
categories one are the pharmaceutical
 
02:29:29.150 --> 02:29:29.160 align:start position:0%
clinical trials so this is where we're
 
02:29:30.650 --> 02:29:30.660 align:start position:0%
talking about the you know phase one
 
02:29:32.570 --> 02:29:32.580 align:start position:0%
phase two phase three clinical trials
 
02:29:35.150 --> 02:29:35.160 align:start position:0%
and in fact there are ongoing um
 
02:29:37.490 --> 02:29:37.500 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical clinical trials for the
 
02:29:39.770 --> 02:29:39.780 align:start position:0%
original monovalent vaccines I I believe
 
02:29:41.450 --> 02:29:41.460 align:start position:0%
they're still ongoing the plan had been
 
02:29:43.550 --> 02:29:43.560 align:start position:0%
to continue those clinical trials for at
 
02:29:45.230 --> 02:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
least a couple of years
 
02:29:46.969 --> 02:29:46.979 align:start position:0%
um but there are all there are also
 
02:29:48.770 --> 02:29:48.780 align:start position:0%
clinical trials that were conducted for
 
02:29:53.170 --> 02:29:53.180 align:start position:0%
beta variant bivalent vaccines ba1 one
 
02:29:56.710 --> 02:29:56.720 align:start position:0%
Omicron bivalent vaccines
 
02:30:01.250 --> 02:30:01.260 align:start position:0%
ba45 bivalent vaccines they're study
 
02:30:03.710 --> 02:30:03.720 align:start position:0%
into other sort of types of in
 
02:30:05.210 --> 02:30:05.220 align:start position:0%
combination vaccines so so there's
 
02:30:07.550 --> 02:30:07.560 align:start position:0%
always those pharmaceutical clinical
 
02:30:10.309 --> 02:30:10.319 align:start position:0%
trials going on but on top of that
 
02:30:12.410 --> 02:30:12.420 align:start position:0%
um there are what we call real world
 
02:30:16.130 --> 02:30:16.140 align:start position:0%
vaccine Effectiveness trials and so you
 
02:30:18.050 --> 02:30:18.060 align:start position:0%
have studies coming out of you know
 
02:30:20.389 --> 02:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
Medical Systems like Kaiser Permanente
 
02:30:23.330 --> 02:30:23.340 align:start position:0%
in California and there was actually a
 
02:30:25.670 --> 02:30:25.680 align:start position:0%
study recently from North Carolina
 
02:30:27.710 --> 02:30:27.720 align:start position:0%
published in in the New England Journal
 
02:30:30.530 --> 02:30:30.540 align:start position:0%
of Medicine showing that the bivalent
 
02:30:34.150 --> 02:30:34.160 align:start position:0%
vaccines have significant added benefit
 
02:30:37.490 --> 02:30:37.500 align:start position:0%
over the monovalent vaccine formulations
 
02:30:40.370 --> 02:30:40.380 align:start position:0%
when used as boosters for protection
 
02:30:43.130 --> 02:30:43.140 align:start position:0%
against infection hospitalization severe
 
02:30:45.349 --> 02:30:45.359 align:start position:0%
disease so so these are studies that are
 
02:30:47.270 --> 02:30:47.280 align:start position:0%
continually rolling out
 
02:30:49.730 --> 02:30:49.740 align:start position:0%
um every week I get new studies in my
 
02:30:52.849 --> 02:30:52.859 align:start position:0%
inbox and so there's no shortage of
 
02:30:55.730 --> 02:30:55.740 align:start position:0%
study of these vaccines and and the the
 
02:30:57.889 --> 02:30:57.899 align:start position:0%
trials are pointing to a number of
 
02:30:57.899 --> 02:30:58.790 align:start position:0%
trials are pointing to a number of
things

02:30:58.790 --> 02:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
things
 
02:31:00.889 --> 02:31:00.899 align:start position:0%
one is that the bivalent Copa 19
 
02:31:03.469 --> 02:31:03.479 align:start position:0%
vaccines do produce a higher antibody
 
02:31:06.349 --> 02:31:06.359 align:start position:0%
response particularly against the more
 
02:31:06.359 --> 02:31:07.309 align:start position:0%
response particularly against the more
recent

02:31:07.309 --> 02:31:07.319 align:start position:0%
recent
 
02:31:10.730 --> 02:31:10.740 align:start position:0%
Omicron variants compared to the older
 
02:31:12.349 --> 02:31:12.359 align:start position:0%
or original formulation of the vaccines
 
02:31:14.210 --> 02:31:14.220 align:start position:0%
there's actually
 
02:31:16.670 --> 02:31:16.680 align:start position:0%
um the the bivalent vaccines are more
 
02:31:19.190 --> 02:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
protective against severe disease and
 
02:31:20.510 --> 02:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
actually there's one trial that just
 
02:31:21.650 --> 02:31:21.660 align:start position:0%
came out I don't want to go two in the
 
02:31:23.210 --> 02:31:23.220 align:start position:0%
weeds here there's one trial that just
 
02:31:25.670 --> 02:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
came out that um was a head-to-head
 
02:31:28.550 --> 02:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
comparison put out by one of the
 
02:31:31.010 --> 02:31:31.020 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical companies from the UK
 
02:31:33.530 --> 02:31:33.540 align:start position:0%
comparing monovalent boosters versus
 
02:31:35.210 --> 02:31:35.220 align:start position:0%
bivalent boosters and they actually in
 
02:31:37.790 --> 02:31:37.800 align:start position:0%
show that they actually showed uh not
 
02:31:40.370 --> 02:31:40.380 align:start position:0%
only decreased risk for severe disease
 
02:31:42.650 --> 02:31:42.660 align:start position:0%
but decreased risk for
 
02:31:45.170 --> 02:31:45.180 align:start position:0%
um people getting covid-19 itself
 
02:31:47.630 --> 02:31:47.640 align:start position:0%
getting infected and developing sickness
 
02:31:50.150 --> 02:31:50.160 align:start position:0%
even if it's not severe disease
 
02:31:50.160 --> 02:31:51.429 align:start position:0%
even if it's not severe disease
yeah

02:31:51.429 --> 02:31:51.439 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:31:51.439 --> 02:31:52.969 align:start position:0%
yeah
also

02:31:52.969 --> 02:31:52.979 align:start position:0%
also
 
02:31:55.849 --> 02:31:55.859 align:start position:0%
I representative Missouri no go ahead
 
02:31:57.530 --> 02:31:57.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:31:59.929 --> 02:31:59.939 align:start position:0%
my question so what vaccine on the
 
02:32:02.270 --> 02:32:02.280 align:start position:0%
childhood schedule has ever not had
 
02:32:04.550 --> 02:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
clinical trials
 
02:32:05.750 --> 02:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
um well I think that comes down to how
 
02:32:08.150 --> 02:32:08.160 align:start position:0%
you Define clinical trials
 
02:32:10.969 --> 02:32:10.979 align:start position:0%
so so you know are you any clinical
 
02:32:13.550 --> 02:32:13.560 align:start position:0%
trial I mean the the kova 19 bivalent
 
02:32:17.150 --> 02:32:17.160 align:start position:0%
vaccines wouldn't fit that criteria
 
02:32:20.450 --> 02:32:20.460 align:start position:0%
the covid-19 bivalent vaccines had
 
02:32:22.690 --> 02:32:22.700 align:start position:0%
clinical trials
 
02:32:26.330 --> 02:32:26.340 align:start position:0%
so I think it comes down to the details
 
02:32:27.590 --> 02:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
of like what do you mean by clinical
 
02:32:27.600 --> 02:32:28.670 align:start position:0%
of like what do you mean by clinical
trials

02:32:28.670 --> 02:32:28.680 align:start position:0%
trials
 
02:32:31.130 --> 02:32:31.140 align:start position:0%
okay and I I think that's I think that's
 
02:32:32.389 --> 02:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
part of our concern and part of our
 
02:32:34.849 --> 02:32:34.859 align:start position:0%
point is that um you know yet there were
 
02:32:37.670 --> 02:32:37.680 align:start position:0%
absolutely problems with the rollout of
 
02:32:40.429 --> 02:32:40.439 align:start position:0%
the bivalent covid-19 vaccines we'll be
 
02:32:42.290 --> 02:32:42.300 align:start position:0%
the first to acknowledge that but a lot
 
02:32:44.809 --> 02:32:44.819 align:start position:0%
of those issues were around the
 
02:32:46.969 --> 02:32:46.979 align:start position:0%
communication and the coordination of
 
02:32:49.490 --> 02:32:49.500 align:start position:0%
that not because there wasn't data
 
02:32:51.349 --> 02:32:51.359 align:start position:0%
showing that the covid-19 vaccines
 
02:32:54.349 --> 02:32:54.359 align:start position:0%
weren't safe or effective
 
02:32:56.030 --> 02:32:56.040 align:start position:0%
and those are two separate issues I
 
02:32:56.040 --> 02:32:56.750 align:start position:0%
and those are two separate issues I
think

02:32:56.750 --> 02:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:33:00.530 --> 02:33:00.540 align:start position:0%
okay follow-up follow-up so out of
 
02:33:04.429 --> 02:33:04.439 align:start position:0%
um the 50 people that I know uh who have
 
02:33:07.190 --> 02:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
received the coveted vaccine probably
 
02:33:08.630 --> 02:33:08.640 align:start position:0%
even more
 
02:33:11.389 --> 02:33:11.399 align:start position:0%
50 of those people still received still
 
02:33:14.450 --> 02:33:14.460 align:start position:0%
got covered and many of them did end up
 
02:33:16.910 --> 02:33:16.920 align:start position:0%
in the hospital so at what point and I
 
02:33:18.770 --> 02:33:18.780 align:start position:0%
think it's you know as an add-on to your
 
02:33:20.210 --> 02:33:20.220 align:start position:0%
question I'm not sure if I heard the
 
02:33:23.150 --> 02:33:23.160 align:start position:0%
answer as at what what point do we put a
 
02:33:26.809 --> 02:33:26.819 align:start position:0%
pause on promoting and distributing
 
02:33:29.630 --> 02:33:29.640 align:start position:0%
vaccines like this that
 
02:33:31.730 --> 02:33:31.740 align:start position:0%
many of us looking around are saying not
 
02:33:35.030 --> 02:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
super effective and honestly as of
 
02:33:38.150 --> 02:33:38.160 align:start position:0%
lately been causing some damage and
 
02:33:40.370 --> 02:33:40.380 align:start position:0%
every single day we are seeing on the
 
02:33:42.469 --> 02:33:42.479 align:start position:0%
news if you're paying attention of
 
02:33:44.410 --> 02:33:44.420 align:start position:0%
people have perfectly healthy people
 
02:33:47.570 --> 02:33:47.580 align:start position:0%
dropping suddenly and people can't
 
02:33:48.969 --> 02:33:48.979 align:start position:0%
figure it out
 
02:33:52.010 --> 02:33:52.020 align:start position:0%
but the timing of it seems interesting
 
02:33:55.730 --> 02:33:55.740 align:start position:0%
to me so but at what point do we put a
 
02:33:58.730 --> 02:33:58.740 align:start position:0%
pause on a vaccine that didn't undergo
 
02:34:01.969 --> 02:34:01.979 align:start position:0%
intensive testing to begin with on
 
02:34:04.849 --> 02:34:04.859 align:start position:0%
humans and
 
02:34:07.730 --> 02:34:07.740 align:start position:0%
you know try and go like
 
02:34:10.849 --> 02:34:10.859 align:start position:0%
we a lot of us have natural immunity you
 
02:34:12.349 --> 02:34:12.359 align:start position:0%
know that should count for something too
 
02:34:14.809 --> 02:34:14.819 align:start position:0%
so at what point do we just stop pushing
 
02:34:17.330 --> 02:34:17.340 align:start position:0%
the vaccine vaccine when some of us see
 
02:34:20.809 --> 02:34:20.819 align:start position:0%
it as at this point not super effective
 
02:34:23.809 --> 02:34:23.819 align:start position:0%
yeah so excuse me
 
02:34:25.250 --> 02:34:25.260 align:start position:0%
um feel free to jump in here if you want
 
02:34:25.260 --> 02:34:26.270 align:start position:0%
um feel free to jump in here if you want
anytime

02:34:26.270 --> 02:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
anytime
 
02:34:29.030 --> 02:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
um so so thank you for those questions
 
02:34:32.690 --> 02:34:32.700 align:start position:0%
um you know the vaccines so I think
 
02:34:33.830 --> 02:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
you've raised a number of different
 
02:34:37.670 --> 02:34:37.680 align:start position:0%
issues um or at different points the
 
02:34:39.590 --> 02:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
first response that I would have is that
 
02:34:41.870 --> 02:34:41.880 align:start position:0%
the vaccines are effective
 
02:34:43.910 --> 02:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
um and this gets I think to the initial
 
02:34:45.530 --> 02:34:45.540 align:start position:0%
question of like well what are what are
 
02:34:47.570 --> 02:34:47.580 align:start position:0%
we measuring what what is the purpose of
 
02:34:51.230 --> 02:34:51.240 align:start position:0%
vaccination and in the early days of the
 
02:34:54.290 --> 02:34:54.300 align:start position:0%
vaccines rolling out there was hope
 
02:34:56.809 --> 02:34:56.819 align:start position:0%
and early data showing that the vaccines
 
02:35:00.469 --> 02:35:00.479 align:start position:0%
were 94 95 effective at preventing even
 
02:35:00.479 --> 02:35:02.330 align:start position:0%
were 94 95 effective at preventing even
infection

02:35:02.330 --> 02:35:02.340 align:start position:0%
infection
 
02:35:04.849 --> 02:35:04.859 align:start position:0%
um and so there was hope and even
 
02:35:07.190 --> 02:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
expectation that the covid-19 vaccines
 
02:35:09.050 --> 02:35:09.060 align:start position:0%
would be um
 
02:35:11.150 --> 02:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
uh would would prevent transmission
 
02:35:13.370 --> 02:35:13.380 align:start position:0%
prevent infection prevent circulation of
 
02:35:15.290 --> 02:35:15.300 align:start position:0%
covet 19. now that didn't pan out for a
 
02:35:17.570 --> 02:35:17.580 align:start position:0%
couple of reasons uh new variants
 
02:35:20.450 --> 02:35:20.460 align:start position:0%
emerged which were more likely to evade
 
02:35:24.170 --> 02:35:24.180 align:start position:0%
or Escape immunity and we've seen the
 
02:35:26.990 --> 02:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
vaccine protection Wane or decrease over
 
02:35:28.969 --> 02:35:28.979 align:start position:0%
time but that doesn't mean that the
 
02:35:30.710 --> 02:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
vaccines aren't effective and don't work
 
02:35:33.770 --> 02:35:33.780 align:start position:0%
there's there's a plethora of data out
 
02:35:35.690 --> 02:35:35.700 align:start position:0%
there showing that the vaccines are
 
02:35:38.510 --> 02:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
effective highly effective still at
 
02:35:40.490 --> 02:35:40.500 align:start position:0%
preventing severe disease preventing
 
02:35:43.250 --> 02:35:43.260 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations preventing deaths
 
02:35:45.469 --> 02:35:45.479 align:start position:0%
um and you know some of that data we
 
02:35:48.050 --> 02:35:48.060 align:start position:0%
highlight in our in our science brief
 
02:35:51.650 --> 02:35:51.660 align:start position:0%
um so I think that uh we we don't agree
 
02:35:53.330 --> 02:35:53.340 align:start position:0%
with the statement that they're not
 
02:35:55.969 --> 02:35:55.979 align:start position:0%
effective they are still effective but
 
02:35:59.030 --> 02:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
the focus of the vaccination programs is
 
02:36:01.130 --> 02:36:01.140 align:start position:0%
Shifting to preventing severe disease
 
02:36:02.809 --> 02:36:02.819 align:start position:0%
severe outcomes like hospitalizations
 
02:36:05.990 --> 02:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
and deaths and in fact we've seen the
 
02:36:07.849 --> 02:36:07.859 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations related to covid-19
 
02:36:11.030 --> 02:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
we've seen deaths related 19 drop and
 
02:36:13.250 --> 02:36:13.260 align:start position:0%
even this past you know since the summer
 
02:36:15.770 --> 02:36:15.780 align:start position:0%
time deaths hospitalizations while they
 
02:36:18.230 --> 02:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
still remain too high are much lower
 
02:36:19.730 --> 02:36:19.740 align:start position:0%
than they were at any other point during
 
02:36:21.410 --> 02:36:21.420 align:start position:0%
the pandemic
 
02:36:24.650 --> 02:36:24.660 align:start position:0%
regarding safety of the vaccines
 
02:36:29.630 --> 02:36:29.640 align:start position:0%
um you know I am uh so there are there
 
02:36:29.640 --> 02:36:31.070 align:start position:0%
um you know I am uh so there are there
is

02:36:31.070 --> 02:36:31.080 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:36:33.950 --> 02:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of wrong information out
 
02:36:38.270 --> 02:36:38.280 align:start position:0%
there about kova 19 vaccines causing a
 
02:36:39.650 --> 02:36:39.660 align:start position:0%
huge number of deaths and that's not
 
02:36:42.530 --> 02:36:42.540 align:start position:0%
true every death that occurs after
 
02:36:45.050 --> 02:36:45.060 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccination gets reported to
 
02:36:46.910 --> 02:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
theirs and part of the reason it's
 
02:36:49.130 --> 02:36:49.140 align:start position:0%
reported is as a surveillance system so
 
02:36:51.410 --> 02:36:51.420 align:start position:0%
it can be investigated further and most
 
02:36:53.030 --> 02:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
of the time what's found is that people
 
02:36:56.030 --> 02:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
died from covid-19 itself the infection
 
02:37:00.110 --> 02:37:00.120 align:start position:0%
not the vaccine or in older adults they
 
02:37:02.389 --> 02:37:02.399 align:start position:0%
died from chronic illness like heart
 
02:37:02.399 --> 02:37:03.429 align:start position:0%
died from chronic illness like heart
disease

02:37:03.429 --> 02:37:03.439 align:start position:0%
disease
 
02:37:05.389 --> 02:37:05.399 align:start position:0%
there are
 
02:37:08.750 --> 02:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge very few
 
02:37:10.610 --> 02:37:10.620 align:start position:0%
if any
 
02:37:13.849 --> 02:37:13.859 align:start position:0%
deaths for example related to covid-19
 
02:37:15.650 --> 02:37:15.660 align:start position:0%
vaccination and this is this is data
 
02:37:16.969 --> 02:37:16.979 align:start position:0%
coming from you know National
 
02:37:18.770 --> 02:37:18.780 align:start position:0%
investigations into each and every one
 
02:37:20.690 --> 02:37:20.700 align:start position:0%
of these deaths that's reported
 
02:37:24.410 --> 02:37:24.420 align:start position:0%
can I have a follow-up so sorry so are
 
02:37:26.150 --> 02:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
you not seeing an increase in myocard
 
02:37:27.770 --> 02:37:27.780 align:start position:0%
artists and teens
 
02:37:30.170 --> 02:37:30.180 align:start position:0%
yeah so so the the exception there is
 
02:37:32.389 --> 02:37:32.399 align:start position:0%
myocarditis there um there has been an
 
02:37:35.690 --> 02:37:35.700 align:start position:0%
association so first off um uh New
 
02:37:36.770 --> 02:37:36.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire doesn't have New Hampshire
 
02:37:38.389 --> 02:37:38.399 align:start position:0%
specific numbers on this but you're
 
02:37:40.550 --> 02:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
right there is an association between
 
02:37:43.670 --> 02:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
kova 19 vaccination and myocarditis or
 
02:37:46.070 --> 02:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
inflammation of the heart muscle there
 
02:37:47.990 --> 02:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
are you know numbers on this you know
 
02:37:50.389 --> 02:37:50.399 align:start position:0%
measuring it in number of cases per
 
02:37:53.990 --> 02:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
million doses administered but again you
 
02:37:54.950 --> 02:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
have to take into account the
 
02:37:57.050 --> 02:37:57.060 align:start position:0%
complications from covid-19 itself and
 
02:37:59.090 --> 02:37:59.100 align:start position:0%
so multiple studies showing that the
 
02:38:01.270 --> 02:38:01.280 align:start position:0%
risks of myocarditis after infection
 
02:38:04.010 --> 02:38:04.020 align:start position:0%
even in that highest risk group young
 
02:38:06.950 --> 02:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
adult adolescent males is anywhere from
 
02:38:09.410 --> 02:38:09.420 align:start position:0%
two to eight times higher from viral
 
02:38:12.050 --> 02:38:12.060 align:start position:0%
infection versus the vaccine and most of
 
02:38:13.610 --> 02:38:13.620 align:start position:0%
the time when people get myocarditis
 
02:38:16.309 --> 02:38:16.319 align:start position:0%
after vaccination it's limited and
 
02:38:18.770 --> 02:38:18.780 align:start position:0%
people recover on their own so there are
 
02:38:20.630 --> 02:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
these concerns I want to acknowledge
 
02:38:20.640 --> 02:38:21.830 align:start position:0%
these concerns I want to acknowledge
that

02:38:21.830 --> 02:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:38:25.670 --> 02:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
um but the the risk benefit analysis
 
02:38:27.770 --> 02:38:27.780 align:start position:0%
that's done has shown that the benefit
 
02:38:29.410 --> 02:38:29.420 align:start position:0%
of vaccination
 
02:38:34.130 --> 02:38:34.140 align:start position:0%
outweighs the minimal safety risks and
 
02:38:36.590 --> 02:38:36.600 align:start position:0%
the rest risk from covid-19 is greater
 
02:38:38.330 --> 02:38:38.340 align:start position:0%
the risk from infection itself is
 
02:38:40.870 --> 02:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
greater than from vaccination
 
02:38:43.790 --> 02:38:43.800 align:start position:0%
was myocarditis you also representative
 
02:38:48.110 --> 02:38:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:50.570 --> 02:38:50.580 align:start position:0%
to uh Dr tanium by the way it's good to
 
02:38:51.770 --> 02:38:51.780 align:start position:0%
see you again
 
02:38:54.469 --> 02:38:54.479 align:start position:0%
nice to have you back in the state
 
02:38:57.469 --> 02:38:57.479 align:start position:0%
when we talk about the efficacy of a
 
02:38:59.210 --> 02:38:59.220 align:start position:0%
vaccine and so forth could you speak to
 
02:39:01.309 --> 02:39:01.319 align:start position:0%
the fact that influenza vaccine itself
 
02:39:03.650 --> 02:39:03.660 align:start position:0%
it doesn't always prevent anybody from
 
02:39:05.750 --> 02:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
getting flu if you will and the
 
02:39:07.429 --> 02:39:07.439 align:start position:0%
complications of it so therefore there's
 
02:39:09.349 --> 02:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
a vaccine that we take almost every
 
02:39:11.630 --> 02:39:11.640 align:start position:0%
single year many of us it does not mean
 
02:39:13.250 --> 02:39:13.260 align:start position:0%
that because we had the vaccine we'll
 
02:39:14.990 --> 02:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
never come down with influenza could you
 
02:39:17.510 --> 02:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
clarify that for me
 
02:39:17.520 --> 02:39:18.889 align:start position:0%
clarify that for me
foreign

02:39:18.889 --> 02:39:18.899 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
02:39:21.230 --> 02:39:21.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so I'll I'll
 
02:39:23.150 --> 02:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
start with the first part of that and
 
02:39:24.889 --> 02:39:24.899 align:start position:0%
then I can hand it over to Dr Chan for
 
02:39:26.990 --> 02:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up and this kind of relates
 
02:39:28.849 --> 02:39:28.859 align:start position:0%
to uh the concerns I have representative
 
02:39:30.410 --> 02:39:30.420 align:start position:0%
Missouri had
 
02:39:32.929 --> 02:39:32.939 align:start position:0%
um where one of our concerns with this
 
02:39:35.450 --> 02:39:35.460 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation is
 
02:39:35.460 --> 02:39:36.230 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation is
um

02:39:36.230 --> 02:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:39.950 --> 02:39:39.960 align:start position:0%
for the Department to not be involved in
 
02:39:42.050 --> 02:39:42.060 align:start position:0%
some of the promotion for certain
 
02:39:43.550 --> 02:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
vaccines and if we really start looking
 
02:39:46.610 --> 02:39:46.620 align:start position:0%
at effect efficacy year over year we
 
02:39:48.170 --> 02:39:48.180 align:start position:0%
know that some years the influenza
 
02:39:50.990 --> 02:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
vaccine is considered 40 to 45 percent
 
02:39:53.330 --> 02:39:53.340 align:start position:0%
effective while other years it can be
 
02:39:55.190 --> 02:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
upwards a double of that for
 
02:39:57.770 --> 02:39:57.780 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness so so to draw a line on
 
02:39:59.389 --> 02:39:59.399 align:start position:0%
what we're going to Define as as
 
02:40:01.910 --> 02:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
effective is one of the concerns that we
 
02:40:03.830 --> 02:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
would have with the legislation as as
 
02:40:03.840 --> 02:40:05.450 align:start position:0%
would have with the legislation as as
written

02:40:05.450 --> 02:40:05.460 align:start position:0%
written
 
02:40:08.030 --> 02:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
okay uh anyone who has not asked a
 
02:40:09.290 --> 02:40:09.300 align:start position:0%
question yet I don't think you have on
 
02:40:11.389 --> 02:40:11.399 align:start position:0%
this bill have you representative McLean
 
02:40:12.830 --> 02:40:12.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr thank you for taking my
 
02:40:15.170 --> 02:40:15.180 align:start position:0%
question so I agree that the bill is
 
02:40:17.450 --> 02:40:17.460 align:start position:0%
problematic but I may think I think
 
02:40:20.389 --> 02:40:20.399 align:start position:0%
there may be a bit of a nugget on on the
 
02:40:22.130 --> 02:40:22.140 align:start position:0%
promotional side of it and so I just
 
02:40:23.870 --> 02:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
wondered if you guys could tease out a
 
02:40:24.889 --> 02:40:24.899 align:start position:0%
little bit more I know that you've
 
02:40:26.990 --> 02:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
talked about it uh with respect to where
 
02:40:29.990 --> 02:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
you see the role of the state in in
 
02:40:31.550 --> 02:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
promoting whether it's the coveted
 
02:40:34.550 --> 02:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
vaccine or the influenza vaccine my
 
02:40:37.910 --> 02:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
personal experience has been that risk
 
02:40:40.790 --> 02:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
benefit analysis is done but it really
 
02:40:43.550 --> 02:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't get down to the patient so I
 
02:40:45.770 --> 02:40:45.780 align:start position:0%
hear on the radio all the time the covet
 
02:40:48.170 --> 02:40:48.180 align:start position:0%
vaccine is safe and effective go out get
 
02:40:50.330 --> 02:40:50.340 align:start position:0%
your influenza vaccine but I'm the guy
 
02:40:52.849 --> 02:40:52.859 align:start position:0%
who always shows up an hour early reads
 
02:40:55.070 --> 02:40:55.080 align:start position:0%
the paperwork I request the written copy
 
02:40:57.770 --> 02:40:57.780 align:start position:0%
of the paperwork on one and so I ask
 
02:41:01.370 --> 02:41:01.380 align:start position:0%
questions and unless it's my pharmacist
 
02:41:03.110 --> 02:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
you know it's coming Direct in the
 
02:41:06.710 --> 02:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
pharmacist invariably the the person can
 
02:41:08.809 --> 02:41:08.819 align:start position:0%
ask answer not if well it's right here
 
02:41:10.250 --> 02:41:10.260 align:start position:0%
I'm just asking a question what does
 
02:41:12.050 --> 02:41:12.060 align:start position:0%
this mean well I don't know what does
 
02:41:14.090 --> 02:41:14.100 align:start position:0%
this mean well I don't know and if
 
02:41:16.490 --> 02:41:16.500 align:start position:0%
that's not from the pharmacist who
 
02:41:19.130 --> 02:41:19.140 align:start position:0%
typically can answer anybody else cannot
 
02:41:22.490 --> 02:41:22.500 align:start position:0%
so in terms of me being able to execute
 
02:41:26.030 --> 02:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
my risk benefit analysis as a patient at
 
02:41:27.670 --> 02:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
your level you may understand
 
02:41:29.990 --> 02:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
but all that the patient's getting
 
02:41:32.450 --> 02:41:32.460 align:start position:0%
really is the promotion and when it
 
02:41:34.370 --> 02:41:34.380 align:start position:0%
comes to getting the data to complete
 
02:41:37.190 --> 02:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
that risk benefit analysis it's just
 
02:41:39.230 --> 02:41:39.240 align:start position:0%
you're not able to do it unless like I
 
02:41:40.910 --> 02:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
said the pharmacist was the person
 
02:41:43.790 --> 02:41:43.800 align:start position:0%
actually delivering the vaccine so what
 
02:41:45.469 --> 02:41:45.479 align:start position:0%
I and that's where I think there may be
 
02:41:47.990 --> 02:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
something in portions of this just want
 
02:41:49.670 --> 02:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
to invite your thoughts on that where
 
02:41:52.969 --> 02:41:52.979 align:start position:0%
you see promotion and what might be done
 
02:41:56.030 --> 02:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
yep thank you for that question so it as
 
02:41:58.429 --> 02:41:58.439 align:start position:0%
we've seen with other key words in this
 
02:42:01.429 --> 02:42:01.439 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation it's very unclear
 
02:42:03.950 --> 02:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
how certain things are being defined and
 
02:42:07.309 --> 02:42:07.319 align:start position:0%
we would say that promotion is another
 
02:42:09.590 --> 02:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
one of those key words
 
02:42:13.730 --> 02:42:13.740 align:start position:0%
um is promotion going to be defined as a
 
02:42:15.830 --> 02:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
physician at the New Hampshire Veterans
 
02:42:19.010 --> 02:42:19.020 align:start position:0%
Home offering a veteran would you like
 
02:42:22.130 --> 02:42:22.140 align:start position:0%
your annual influenza vaccine we don't
 
02:42:23.809 --> 02:42:23.819 align:start position:0%
have answers to these questions because
 
02:42:25.610 --> 02:42:25.620 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the the language in this
 
02:42:28.490 --> 02:42:28.500 align:start position:0%
bill is just so vague and the the intent
 
02:42:30.070 --> 02:42:30.080 align:start position:0%
really isn't clear there
 
02:42:32.990 --> 02:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
is you know and as you mentioned before
 
02:42:36.469 --> 02:42:36.479 align:start position:0%
uh you know great on you for doing all
 
02:42:38.150 --> 02:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
that additional research and asking
 
02:42:39.770 --> 02:42:39.780 align:start position:0%
those questions and being engaged and
 
02:42:41.210 --> 02:42:41.220 align:start position:0%
that is something that you know any
 
02:42:43.250 --> 02:42:43.260 align:start position:0%
provider any pharmacist loves to see
 
02:42:45.590 --> 02:42:45.600 align:start position:0%
from their patients but again there are
 
02:42:47.929 --> 02:42:47.939 align:start position:0%
other mechanisms in place where
 
02:42:50.750 --> 02:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
in that facility you know for
 
02:42:52.429 --> 02:42:52.439 align:start position:0%
particularly the pharmacy you know that
 
02:42:55.010 --> 02:42:55.020 align:start position:0%
person is supposed to be offered the uh
 
02:42:56.870 --> 02:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
right to receive counseling from a
 
02:42:59.570 --> 02:42:59.580 align:start position:0%
pharmacist and that person can choose or
 
02:43:01.969 --> 02:43:01.979 align:start position:0%
you know Choose Or deny that um that
 
02:43:01.979 --> 02:43:03.290 align:start position:0%
you know Choose Or deny that um that
offer

02:43:03.290 --> 02:43:03.300 align:start position:0%
offer
 
02:43:05.150 --> 02:43:05.160 align:start position:0%
and if I can just quickly add from like
 
02:43:07.250 --> 02:43:07.260 align:start position:0%
a practical standpoint you know we we
 
02:43:10.130 --> 02:43:10.140 align:start position:0%
talk about influenza every year and we
 
02:43:13.130 --> 02:43:13.140 align:start position:0%
get asked uh publicly by media what can
 
02:43:14.690 --> 02:43:14.700 align:start position:0%
people do to protect themselves from
 
02:43:16.849 --> 02:43:16.859 align:start position:0%
influenza and so this legislation
 
02:43:19.429 --> 02:43:19.439 align:start position:0%
potentially would prevent us from saying
 
02:43:22.309 --> 02:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
publicly well influenza activity is
 
02:43:24.950 --> 02:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
going up get a flu vaccine right that's
 
02:43:26.750 --> 02:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
promotion of a flu vaccine so so there's
 
02:43:28.190 --> 02:43:28.200 align:start position:0%
real I think practical real world
 
02:43:30.050 --> 02:43:30.060 align:start position:0%
implications for how Public Health talks
 
02:43:32.330 --> 02:43:32.340 align:start position:0%
about and messages some of these
 
02:43:34.550 --> 02:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
Therapeutics and you know that doesn't
 
02:43:34.560 --> 02:43:35.990 align:start position:0%
Therapeutics and you know that doesn't
seem

02:43:35.990 --> 02:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
seem
 
02:43:37.429 --> 02:43:37.439 align:start position:0%
right to us but it also doesn't seem
 
02:43:38.630 --> 02:43:38.640 align:start position:0%
like maybe that's the intent the
 
02:43:40.130 --> 02:43:40.140 align:start position:0%
underlying intent for the legislation so
 
02:43:41.150 --> 02:43:41.160 align:start position:0%
we just want to acknowledge that there
 
02:43:42.290 --> 02:43:42.300 align:start position:0%
are some
 
02:43:45.110 --> 02:43:45.120 align:start position:0%
potentially significant impacts on our
 
02:43:46.730 --> 02:43:46.740 align:start position:0%
ability but also our partner's ability
 
02:43:48.830 --> 02:43:48.840 align:start position:0%
to operate with the some of the vague
 
02:43:49.990 --> 02:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
wording in this legislation
 
02:43:52.130 --> 02:43:52.140 align:start position:0%
representative Palazzo
 
02:43:54.530 --> 02:43:54.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:43:58.550 --> 02:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh two parts first it
 
02:44:00.830 --> 02:44:00.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't only talk about vaccines it
 
02:44:03.849 --> 02:44:03.859 align:start position:0%
talks about pharmaceutical products but
 
02:44:07.010 --> 02:44:07.020 align:start position:0%
what about some other medications would
 
02:44:10.790 --> 02:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
you be open to expand it for example in
 
02:44:14.389 --> 02:44:14.399 align:start position:0%
terms of masks policies now most people
 
02:44:17.630 --> 02:44:17.640 align:start position:0%
in this room are musculus despite some
 
02:44:21.950 --> 02:44:21.960 align:start position:0%
cells covered to violence go going
 
02:44:25.790 --> 02:44:25.800 align:start position:0%
around and but it was slow to implement
 
02:44:30.230 --> 02:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
and stop masks mandates even when there
 
02:44:32.690 --> 02:44:32.700 align:start position:0%
were some facts that they were
 
02:44:35.389 --> 02:44:35.399 align:start position:0%
ineffective at the same time it's the
 
02:44:38.510 --> 02:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
beginning of pandemic in the early 2020
 
02:44:40.849 --> 02:44:40.859 align:start position:0%
the citation was the opposite all the
 
02:44:46.010 --> 02:44:46.020 align:start position:0%
data was that the masks were helpful but
 
02:44:46.020 --> 02:44:47.770 align:start position:0%
data was that the masks were helpful but
uh

02:44:47.770 --> 02:44:47.780 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:44:50.349 --> 02:44:50.359 align:start position:0%
Professionals in your organizations
 
02:44:52.969 --> 02:44:52.979 align:start position:0%
believed that masks were helpful but
 
02:44:55.130 --> 02:44:55.140 align:start position:0%
were advising public
 
02:44:58.309 --> 02:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
in middle west because there was a push
 
02:45:01.610 --> 02:45:01.620 align:start position:0%
to I don't know Federal push Point
 
02:45:04.190 --> 02:45:04.200 align:start position:0%
border Mr chairman yes representative
 
02:45:04.200 --> 02:45:05.450 align:start position:0%
border Mr chairman yes representative
Weber

02:45:05.450 --> 02:45:05.460 align:start position:0%
Weber
 
02:45:07.969 --> 02:45:07.979 align:start position:0%
um in the interest of time I would like
 
02:45:10.969 --> 02:45:10.979 align:start position:0%
to ask if if mandates aren't well
 
02:45:13.550 --> 02:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
outside of what is covered with this
 
02:45:13.560 --> 02:45:20.510 align:start position:0%
outside of what is covered with this
bill

02:45:20.510 --> 02:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:23.450 --> 02:45:23.460 align:start position:0%
okay I can I will concentrate on if I
 
02:45:27.790 --> 02:45:27.800 align:start position:0%
may uh on on this bill and uh
 
02:45:31.429 --> 02:45:31.439 align:start position:0%
so in in terms of uh pharmaceutical
 
02:45:35.030 --> 02:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
products and vaccines wouldn't be easier
 
02:45:38.410 --> 02:45:38.420 align:start position:0%
for you to follow fact-based medicine
 
02:45:43.190 --> 02:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
because you testified that sometimes uh
 
02:45:47.809 --> 02:45:47.819 align:start position:0%
um public health and sometimes just hope
 
02:45:52.130 --> 02:45:52.140 align:start position:0%
is guiding your or let's say like I hope
 
02:45:54.950 --> 02:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
that vaccines will prevent infections
 
02:45:59.750 --> 02:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
and sometimes that hope uh and let's say
 
02:46:02.389 --> 02:46:02.399 align:start position:0%
it did not materialized so it wouldn't
 
02:46:05.270 --> 02:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
be easier for you if you will be guided
 
02:46:05.280 --> 02:46:06.849 align:start position:0%
be easier for you if you will be guided
by

02:46:06.849 --> 02:46:06.859 align:start position:0%
by
 
02:46:11.770 --> 02:46:11.780 align:start position:0%
fact-based well-tested sort ofly tested
 
02:46:15.550 --> 02:46:15.560 align:start position:0%
guidance thank you
 
02:46:18.590 --> 02:46:18.600 align:start position:0%
well I'll just say uh quickly that you
 
02:46:21.950 --> 02:46:21.960 align:start position:0%
know I don't I think I we use science
 
02:46:24.710 --> 02:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
and evidence and studies to
 
02:46:24.720 --> 02:46:25.550 align:start position:0%
and evidence and studies to
um

02:46:25.550 --> 02:46:25.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:46:28.130 --> 02:46:28.140 align:start position:0%
uh talk about and promote vaccination
 
02:46:29.630 --> 02:46:29.640 align:start position:0%
that's why we're out there talking about
 
02:46:31.730 --> 02:46:31.740 align:start position:0%
numbers and vaccine Effectiveness
 
02:46:33.889 --> 02:46:33.899 align:start position:0%
numbers and different studies that are
 
02:46:36.110 --> 02:46:36.120 align:start position:0%
done and so so much of that literature
 
02:46:37.969 --> 02:46:37.979 align:start position:0%
that we've been reviewing on
 
02:46:39.349 --> 02:46:39.359 align:start position:0%
particularly vaccines throughout the
 
02:46:42.349 --> 02:46:42.359 align:start position:0%
pandemic but but also other Therapeutics
 
02:46:44.210 --> 02:46:44.220 align:start position:0%
um you know but but the vaccine science
 
02:46:46.190 --> 02:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
is outlined in our New Hampshire science
 
02:46:47.809 --> 02:46:47.819 align:start position:0%
data brief
 
02:46:49.610 --> 02:46:49.620 align:start position:0%
so anyone who has not asked a question
 
02:46:51.889 --> 02:46:51.899 align:start position:0%
yet of these gentlemen
 
02:46:53.870 --> 02:46:53.880 align:start position:0%
I think we've pretty well covered it so
 
02:47:01.750 --> 02:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:04.550 --> 02:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
also signed up to test uh to speak today
 
02:47:10.250 --> 02:47:10.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:11.809 --> 02:47:11.819 align:start position:0%
you asked for three to five minutes if
 
02:47:13.370 --> 02:47:13.380 align:start position:0%
you could keep closer to the three
 
02:47:38.270 --> 02:47:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:38.280 --> 02:47:41.750 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:47:41.750 --> 02:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:44.630 --> 02:47:44.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for inviting me
 
02:47:47.030 --> 02:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
um I've given you my written testimony
 
02:47:49.090 --> 02:47:49.100 align:start position:0%
I'm uh
 
02:47:51.830 --> 02:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
confused right now because the previous
 
02:47:54.170 --> 02:47:54.180 align:start position:0%
speakers have obfuscated and made some
 
02:47:56.330 --> 02:47:56.340 align:start position:0%
errors in what they've said and I wanted
 
02:47:58.670 --> 02:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
to correct those errors but I also want
 
02:48:01.010 --> 02:48:01.020 align:start position:0%
to give you my testimony so help me tell
 
02:48:02.809 --> 02:48:02.819 align:start position:0%
me what I should do
 
02:48:05.690 --> 02:48:05.700 align:start position:0%
testimony first please okay
 
02:48:08.330 --> 02:48:08.340 align:start position:0%
uh my name is Dr Merrill nass
 
02:48:11.150 --> 02:48:11.160 align:start position:0%
um I'm in favor of this bill I'm a main
 
02:48:14.690 --> 02:48:14.700 align:start position:0%
physician I am currently suspended on my
 
02:48:17.389 --> 02:48:17.399 align:start position:0%
license for providing early treatment
 
02:48:20.270 --> 02:48:20.280 align:start position:0%
for covid and uh telling the truth about
 
02:48:21.950 --> 02:48:21.960 align:start position:0%
the vaccines I'm in the middle of a
 
02:48:21.960 --> 02:48:23.570 align:start position:0%
the vaccines I'm in the middle of a
hearing

02:48:23.570 --> 02:48:23.580 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
02:48:26.750 --> 02:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
a vaccine okay there are two kinds of
 
02:48:29.570 --> 02:48:29.580 align:start position:0%
products under the FDA under the law in
 
02:48:31.250 --> 02:48:31.260 align:start position:0%
the United States there are licensed
 
02:48:33.349 --> 02:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
products and unlicensed products there
 
02:48:35.929 --> 02:48:35.939 align:start position:0%
are only two kinds licensed is called
 
02:48:39.770 --> 02:48:39.780 align:start position:0%
approved in FDA terminology unlicensed
 
02:48:43.490 --> 02:48:43.500 align:start position:0%
if it's under eua is called authorized
 
02:48:45.950 --> 02:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
in this written testimony that you have
 
02:48:49.550 --> 02:48:49.560 align:start position:0%
I've given you statements from glaxo
 
02:48:51.590 --> 02:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
from the American College of Physicians
 
02:48:54.530 --> 02:48:54.540 align:start position:0%
and from the CDC about what it takes to
 
02:48:56.690 --> 02:48:56.700 align:start position:0%
license a vaccine
 
02:48:59.270 --> 02:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
the reason why it's such an arduous long
 
02:49:01.969 --> 02:49:01.979 align:start position:0%
process is because there's been lots of
 
02:49:05.630 --> 02:49:05.640 align:start position:0%
problems found in vaccine development in
 
02:49:07.429 --> 02:49:07.439 align:start position:0%
the United States over at least the last
 
02:49:13.610 --> 02:49:13.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:13.620 --> 02:49:14.150 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:49:14.150 --> 02:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:49:17.330 --> 02:49:17.340 align:start position:0%
vaccines in cats still cause sarcomas
 
02:49:20.290 --> 02:49:20.300 align:start position:0%
which are Cancers
 
02:49:24.230 --> 02:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
multiple vaccines are grown in tissue
 
02:49:27.230 --> 02:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
cultures and these tissue cultures the
 
02:49:29.630 --> 02:49:29.640 align:start position:0%
cells may contain oncogenes in other
 
02:49:31.910 --> 02:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
words genes that have been inserted into
 
02:49:36.650 --> 02:49:36.660 align:start position:0%
the DNA of of the cell line but may come
 
02:49:38.690 --> 02:49:38.700 align:start position:0%
out and potentially could cause a cancer
 
02:49:41.870 --> 02:49:41.880 align:start position:0%
for example the flu cell vacs is one of
 
02:49:44.570 --> 02:49:44.580 align:start position:0%
about 10 flu vaccines that are licensed
 
02:49:47.030 --> 02:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
in the United States it is grown in the
 
02:49:49.670 --> 02:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
maiden Darby canine kidney tissue
 
02:49:52.790 --> 02:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
culture if you take those cells and give
 
02:49:55.730 --> 02:49:55.740 align:start position:0%
them to nude mice they cause cancer
 
02:49:57.770 --> 02:49:57.780 align:start position:0%
but we are getting those as flu shots
 
02:49:59.750 --> 02:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
they generally don't cause cancer in us
 
02:50:02.210 --> 02:50:02.220 align:start position:0%
but this is the reason you have to go
 
02:50:04.250 --> 02:50:04.260 align:start position:0%
through a process
 
02:50:06.170 --> 02:50:06.180 align:start position:0%
there are other vaccines that cause
 
02:50:09.110 --> 02:50:09.120 align:start position:0%
thyroid diseases in dogs there are many
 
02:50:11.990 --> 02:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
many potential problems in a colored
 
02:50:14.889 --> 02:50:14.899 align:start position:0%
graphic I've shown you five disasters
 
02:50:18.349 --> 02:50:18.359 align:start position:0%
when vaccines were rolled out quickly in
 
02:50:22.190 --> 02:50:22.200 align:start position:0%
the United States and in fact this
 
02:50:24.410 --> 02:50:24.420 align:start position:0%
coveted vaccine was not the fastest that
 
02:50:27.230 --> 02:50:27.240 align:start position:0%
got rolled out it apparently took 326
 
02:50:29.389 --> 02:50:29.399 align:start position:0%
days we've had them roll out before in
 
02:50:30.650 --> 02:50:30.660 align:start position:0%
six months
 
02:50:32.929 --> 02:50:32.939 align:start position:0%
there's a big problem potentially coming
 
02:50:36.410 --> 02:50:36.420 align:start position:0%
up and that is a non-profit called sepi
 
02:50:40.670 --> 02:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
Coalition for epidemic preparedness it
 
02:50:41.990 --> 02:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
is funded by the United States
 
02:50:45.110 --> 02:50:45.120 align:start position:0%
government Norway UK many countries over
 
02:50:47.630 --> 02:50:47.640 align:start position:0%
30 countries fund it and they are
 
02:50:49.730 --> 02:50:49.740 align:start position:0%
pledging to roll out vaccines in the
 
02:50:53.889 --> 02:50:53.899 align:start position:0%
future in 100 days for the next pandemic
 
02:50:56.330 --> 02:50:56.340 align:start position:0%
that is extremely dangerous there will
 
02:50:58.790 --> 02:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
be no possibility to test them in humans
 
02:51:00.530 --> 02:51:00.540 align:start position:0%
for safety
 
02:51:00.540 --> 02:51:01.250 align:start position:0%
for safety
um

02:51:01.250 --> 02:51:01.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:03.410 --> 02:51:03.420 align:start position:0%
but that is what's coming up and I've
 
02:51:05.030 --> 02:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
shown you a little bit about that that
 
02:51:06.650 --> 02:51:06.660 align:start position:0%
is they are funded also by Bill and
 
02:51:08.929 --> 02:51:08.939 align:start position:0%
Melinda Gates Foundation and
 
02:51:10.790 --> 02:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
um the welcome trust it's a very
 
02:51:14.090 --> 02:51:14.100 align:start position:0%
important it the the president is an
 
02:51:15.469 --> 02:51:15.479 align:start position:0%
American who spent his career working
 
02:51:17.150 --> 02:51:17.160 align:start position:0%
for the U.S government
 
02:51:17.160 --> 02:51:18.590 align:start position:0%
for the U.S government
okay

02:51:18.590 --> 02:51:18.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:51:18.600 --> 02:51:19.490 align:start position:0%
okay
um

02:51:19.490 --> 02:51:19.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:21.710 --> 02:51:21.720 align:start position:0%
I would ask that you amend the language
 
02:51:23.510 --> 02:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
02:51:25.730 --> 02:51:25.740 align:start position:0%
um the speakers before me made a mistake
 
02:51:29.330 --> 02:51:29.340 align:start position:0%
the only vaccines that are available in
 
02:51:31.790 --> 02:51:31.800 align:start position:0%
the United States that are licensed
 
02:51:34.309 --> 02:51:34.319 align:start position:0%
without human clinical trials are the
 
02:51:37.790 --> 02:51:37.800 align:start position:0%
flu vaccines no others are and no others
 
02:51:39.590 --> 02:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
will be there are no pneumococcal
 
02:51:41.630 --> 02:51:41.640 align:start position:0%
vaccines that are licensed without
 
02:51:44.990 --> 02:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:47.030 --> 02:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
um this is this has been done for
 
02:51:49.610 --> 02:51:49.620 align:start position:0%
decades it's considered safe these
 
02:51:51.650 --> 02:51:51.660 align:start position:0%
vaccines are pretty well known although
 
02:51:55.010 --> 02:51:55.020 align:start position:0%
they keep developing new platforms for
 
02:51:56.389 --> 02:51:56.399 align:start position:0%
flu vaccines
 
02:51:58.490 --> 02:51:58.500 align:start position:0%
so we have a flu vaccine that's been
 
02:52:00.469 --> 02:52:00.479 align:start position:0%
around for about 10 years now that's
 
02:52:02.809 --> 02:52:02.819 align:start position:0%
grown up in cells in tissue culture of
 
02:52:05.929 --> 02:52:05.939 align:start position:0%
the full army worm for example and
 
02:52:07.670 --> 02:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
there's a small amount of DNA and
 
02:52:11.809 --> 02:52:11.819 align:start position:0%
protein from that worm or or moth just
 
02:52:13.730 --> 02:52:13.740 align:start position:0%
as there is a tiny amount of DNA and
 
02:52:15.349 --> 02:52:15.359 align:start position:0%
protein from the
 
02:52:18.830 --> 02:52:18.840 align:start position:0%
kidney the the dog kidney cells in the
 
02:52:22.190 --> 02:52:22.200 align:start position:0%
flucelvax vaccine the army worm vaccine
 
02:52:24.349 --> 02:52:24.359 align:start position:0%
is called flu block
 
02:52:26.150 --> 02:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
and when you go to a pharmacy you really
 
02:52:27.590 --> 02:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
don't know what you're getting unless
 
02:52:29.450 --> 02:52:29.460 align:start position:0%
unless you ask
 
02:52:36.230 --> 02:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:38.570 --> 02:52:38.580 align:start position:0%
so almost every time a vaccine has been
 
02:52:40.309 --> 02:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
rolled out quickly because it was an
 
02:52:42.530 --> 02:52:42.540 align:start position:0%
emergency there was an unanticipated
 
02:52:45.349 --> 02:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
disaster and usually it led to the
 
02:52:48.110 --> 02:52:48.120 align:start position:0%
ending of the vaccine program
 
02:52:51.769 --> 02:52:51.779 align:start position:0%
in 1955 the Qatar incident occurred in
 
02:52:53.750 --> 02:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
which forty thousand children got polio
 
02:52:56.269 --> 02:52:56.279 align:start position:0%
from an improperly activated inactivated
 
02:53:00.290 --> 02:53:00.300 align:start position:0%
vaccine and in 1976 400 Americans got
 
02:53:02.269 --> 02:53:02.279 align:start position:0%
Guillain-Barre syndrome a paralytic
 
02:53:05.090 --> 02:53:05.100 align:start position:0%
illness at least 25 died in the swine
 
02:53:07.490 --> 02:53:07.500 align:start position:0%
flu vaccine program ended could you
 
02:53:09.769 --> 02:53:09.779 align:start position:0%
begin wrapping up ma'am please I have a
 
02:53:12.590 --> 02:53:12.600 align:start position:0%
couple more paragraphs since 2020
 
02:53:14.210 --> 02:53:14.220 align:start position:0%
thousands of Americans have developed
 
02:53:16.550 --> 02:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
myocarditis and I will give you in a
 
02:53:20.150 --> 02:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
future testimony today data on the
 
02:53:22.490 --> 02:53:22.500 align:start position:0%
myocarditis problem
 
02:53:24.769 --> 02:53:24.779 align:start position:0%
if you don't want New Hampshire citizens
 
02:53:27.230 --> 02:53:27.240 align:start position:0%
to be among the guinea pigs for these
 
02:53:30.710 --> 02:53:30.720 align:start position:0%
rapidly rolled out future vaccines as
 
02:53:32.870 --> 02:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
well as potentially we don't know what
 
02:53:34.790 --> 02:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
the problems are yet with a bivalence
 
02:53:36.170 --> 02:53:36.180 align:start position:0%
because they only were rolled out in
 
02:53:36.180 --> 02:53:37.370 align:start position:0%
because they only were rolled out in
September

02:53:37.370 --> 02:53:37.380 align:start position:0%
September
 
02:53:40.070 --> 02:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
vote for this bill New Hampshire can
 
02:53:41.929 --> 02:53:41.939 align:start position:0%
protect its citizens from precipitous
 
02:53:43.790 --> 02:53:43.800 align:start position:0%
and Reckless medical experiments by
 
02:53:45.889 --> 02:53:45.899 align:start position:0%
simply requiring that all vaccines
 
02:53:48.889 --> 02:53:48.899 align:start position:0%
accept the seasonal flu vaccines go
 
02:53:50.510 --> 02:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
through human clinical trials before
 
02:53:52.550 --> 02:53:52.560 align:start position:0%
being rolled out for Mass use
 
02:53:55.550 --> 02:53:55.560 align:start position:0%
this is what it takes to be licensed and
 
02:53:58.429 --> 02:53:58.439 align:start position:0%
be called safe and effective citizens of
 
02:54:01.250 --> 02:54:01.260 align:start position:0%
the Granite State deserve no less please
 
02:54:04.610 --> 02:54:04.620 align:start position:0%
protect us thank you thank you
 
02:54:04.620 --> 02:54:08.809 align:start position:0%
protect us thank you thank you
questions

02:54:08.809 --> 02:54:08.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:11.450 --> 02:54:11.460 align:start position:0%
yes representative McLean
 
02:54:13.010 --> 02:54:13.020 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:54:16.190 --> 02:54:16.200 align:start position:0%
taking my question I mean at 10 years is
 
02:54:18.309 --> 02:54:18.319 align:start position:0%
a is a very long time
 
02:54:22.070 --> 02:54:22.080 align:start position:0%
to approve a vaccine and given that
 
02:54:24.309 --> 02:54:24.319 align:start position:0%
there may be situations where there's
 
02:54:26.710 --> 02:54:26.720 align:start position:0%
life-saving opportunity
 
02:54:30.230 --> 02:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
uh don't you think if you say I'm gonna
 
02:54:32.990 --> 02:54:33.000 align:start position:0%
take away that right all together
 
02:54:35.030 --> 02:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
um that you would be depriving people of
 
02:54:36.830 --> 02:54:36.840 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to make their own
 
02:54:36.840 --> 02:54:38.450 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to make their own
assessment

02:54:38.450 --> 02:54:38.460 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
02:54:40.490 --> 02:54:40.500 align:start position:0%
um what do you think of that so there's
 
02:54:42.410 --> 02:54:42.420 align:start position:0%
two answers to your question
 
02:54:44.830 --> 02:54:44.840 align:start position:0%
um the first is yes if you give people
 
02:54:47.269 --> 02:54:47.279 align:start position:0%
adequate informed consent they should be
 
02:54:49.429 --> 02:54:49.439 align:start position:0%
able to do whatever they want no one
 
02:54:51.290 --> 02:54:51.300 align:start position:0%
received in for adequate informed
 
02:54:52.910 --> 02:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
consent for the coveted vaccines and
 
02:54:55.730 --> 02:54:55.740 align:start position:0%
they generally don't I mean if you got a
 
02:54:58.250 --> 02:54:58.260 align:start position:0%
the flu vaccine made in the fall army
 
02:55:00.349 --> 02:55:00.359 align:start position:0%
worm or the dog kidney cell were you
 
02:55:02.870 --> 02:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
told that there was an oncogenic uh you
 
02:55:05.389 --> 02:55:05.399 align:start position:0%
know virus in it so that's the problem
 
02:55:07.429 --> 02:55:07.439 align:start position:0%
particularly with covid when these
 
02:55:09.590 --> 02:55:09.600 align:start position:0%
things were deliberately given out by
 
02:55:11.389 --> 02:55:11.399 align:start position:0%
national Guardsmen who have no medical
 
02:55:13.190 --> 02:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
training there could be no informed
 
02:55:15.530 --> 02:55:15.540 align:start position:0%
consent there were a variety of informed
 
02:55:17.630 --> 02:55:17.640 align:start position:0%
consent forms that I have reviewed and
 
02:55:19.190 --> 02:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
some of them simply asked for your name
 
02:55:21.469 --> 02:55:21.479 align:start position:0%
your address your demographics and then
 
02:55:23.030 --> 02:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
said you're signing an informed consent
 
02:55:26.330 --> 02:55:26.340 align:start position:0%
form so the other part of informed
 
02:55:28.309 --> 02:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
consent and what is required by law but
 
02:55:30.530 --> 02:55:30.540 align:start position:0%
didn't always happen under the emergency
 
02:55:32.450 --> 02:55:32.460 align:start position:0%
use authorization bill which is called
 
02:55:35.450 --> 02:55:35.460 align:start position:0%
the prep act and was only passed in 2005
 
02:55:38.030 --> 02:55:38.040 align:start position:0%
before 2005 there were no emergency use
 
02:55:40.130 --> 02:55:40.140 align:start position:0%
authorizations there are only licensed
 
02:55:43.429 --> 02:55:43.439 align:start position:0%
drugs and compassionate use
 
02:55:46.670 --> 02:55:46.680 align:start position:0%
um that that bill requires that all
 
02:55:49.429 --> 02:55:49.439 align:start position:0%
significant known risks and benefits be
 
02:55:51.769 --> 02:55:51.779 align:start position:0%
provided to the patient and that is in
 
02:55:54.650 --> 02:55:54.660 align:start position:0%
lieu of the previous written informed
 
02:55:54.660 --> 02:55:55.670 align:start position:0%
lieu of the previous written informed
consent

02:55:55.670 --> 02:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
consent
 
02:55:58.370 --> 02:55:58.380 align:start position:0%
and even that minimized informed consent
 
02:56:01.969 --> 02:56:01.979 align:start position:0%
has not been provided to people so
 
02:56:04.550 --> 02:56:04.560 align:start position:0%
um so that's where the problem is now
 
02:56:07.250 --> 02:56:07.260 align:start position:0%
yeah it doesn't necessarily have to take
 
02:56:09.830 --> 02:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
10 years to make a vaccine some are made
 
02:56:11.929 --> 02:56:11.939 align:start position:0%
faster and some slower
 
02:56:14.450 --> 02:56:14.460 align:start position:0%
we had another problem with covid which
 
02:56:18.110 --> 02:56:18.120 align:start position:0%
was that the CDC and the FDA or and some
 
02:56:20.750 --> 02:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
other people already knew that we had
 
02:56:23.630 --> 02:56:23.640 align:start position:0%
drugs that would kill the covet virus in
 
02:56:25.550 --> 02:56:25.560 align:start position:0%
tissue culture and they suppressed their
 
02:56:28.370 --> 02:56:28.380 align:start position:0%
use in order to wait for a vaccine
 
02:56:31.490 --> 02:56:31.500 align:start position:0%
it's very and they knew because they had
 
02:56:35.150 --> 02:56:35.160 align:start position:0%
tested the 60 over 60 drugs were
 
02:56:37.550 --> 02:56:37.560 align:start position:0%
identified by the NIH in a paper
 
02:56:41.510 --> 02:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
published in 2014 that killed the
 
02:56:45.530 --> 02:56:45.540 align:start position:0%
um SARS one and or MERS both beta
 
02:56:47.690 --> 02:56:47.700 align:start position:0%
coronaviruses in tissue culture they
 
02:56:49.849 --> 02:56:49.859 align:start position:0%
knew about this their people published
 
02:56:52.969 --> 02:56:52.979 align:start position:0%
it they suppressed it it's very likely
 
02:56:54.710 --> 02:56:54.720 align:start position:0%
that there are other drugs that will
 
02:56:57.650 --> 02:56:57.660 align:start position:0%
work against other new
 
02:56:57.660 --> 02:56:58.790 align:start position:0%
work against other new
um

02:56:58.790 --> 02:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:57:02.750 --> 02:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
pandemic viruses or bacteria but we need
 
02:57:04.250 --> 02:57:04.260 align:start position:0%
federal agencies that are going to allow
 
02:57:06.410 --> 02:57:06.420 align:start position:0%
us to to have them I lost my license
 
02:57:08.570 --> 02:57:08.580 align:start position:0%
because I was providing fully licensed
 
02:57:12.050 --> 02:57:12.060 align:start position:0%
drugs which I'm perfectly legally able
 
02:57:14.630 --> 02:57:14.640 align:start position:0%
to do to patients who wanted them you
 
02:57:16.910 --> 02:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
know and and that was considered a
 
02:57:19.250 --> 02:57:19.260 align:start position:0%
heinous crime and my license was
 
02:57:21.650 --> 02:57:21.660 align:start position:0%
immediately suspended
 
02:57:23.389 --> 02:57:23.399 align:start position:0%
um there's one other thing I wanted to
 
02:57:25.070 --> 02:57:25.080 align:start position:0%
say and now I've I've forgotten what it
 
02:57:26.570 --> 02:57:26.580 align:start position:0%
is okay
 
02:57:28.670 --> 02:57:28.680 align:start position:0%
a quick follow-up please thank you Mr
 
02:57:28.680 --> 02:57:29.510 align:start position:0%
a quick follow-up please thank you Mr
chair

02:57:29.510 --> 02:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:57:31.910 --> 02:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
um so while I agree
 
02:57:34.010 --> 02:57:34.020 align:start position:0%
um with your comments about informed
 
02:57:36.410 --> 02:57:36.420 align:start position:0%
consent and that it wasn't the best
 
02:57:39.050 --> 02:57:39.060 align:start position:0%
um but this bill goes Way Beyond
 
02:57:41.030 --> 02:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
addressing that
 
02:57:42.650 --> 02:57:42.660 align:start position:0%
um so do you
 
02:57:45.290 --> 02:57:45.300 align:start position:0%
because basically it takes the state out
 
02:57:48.530 --> 02:57:48.540 align:start position:0%
of everything Distributing purchasing
 
02:57:50.809 --> 02:57:50.819 align:start position:0%
um so what are your thoughts on that
 
02:57:50.819 --> 02:57:51.769 align:start position:0%
um so what are your thoughts on that
though

02:57:51.769 --> 02:57:51.779 align:start position:0%
though
 
02:57:57.590 --> 02:57:57.600 align:start position:0%
so I want to emphasize that almost all
 
02:58:00.950 --> 02:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
the vaccines that we have are licensed
 
02:58:02.870 --> 02:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
everything is licensed otherwise you
 
02:58:05.750 --> 02:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
can't get it unless it's under eua so
 
02:58:08.389 --> 02:58:08.399 align:start position:0%
right now only the covid vaccines are
 
02:58:11.510 --> 02:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
under eua previously an anthrax vaccine
 
02:58:14.990 --> 02:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
a smallpox vaccine have been under eua
 
02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:17.570 align:start position:0%
a smallpox vaccine have been under eua
um

02:58:17.570 --> 02:58:17.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:17.580 --> 02:58:19.730 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:58:19.730 --> 02:58:19.740 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:58:23.210 --> 02:58:23.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:25.969 --> 02:58:25.979 align:start position:0%
the covid vaccines don't really work I'm
 
02:58:27.710 --> 02:58:27.720 align:start position:0%
going to tell you in a later testimony
 
02:58:30.769 --> 02:58:30.779 align:start position:0%
what Tony fauci said to uh three or
 
02:58:32.510 --> 02:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
three weeks ago in a paper he just
 
02:58:35.690 --> 02:58:35.700 align:start position:0%
published the efficacy is poor the
 
02:58:38.030 --> 02:58:38.040 align:start position:0%
duration there's a very brief positive
 
02:58:40.910 --> 02:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
duration of action then it goes to zero
 
02:58:44.030 --> 02:58:44.040 align:start position:0%
and then the effects become negative
 
02:58:46.969 --> 02:58:46.979 align:start position:0%
um overall there's been no real risk
 
02:58:48.950 --> 02:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
benefit analysis of the coveted vaccines
 
02:58:52.429 --> 02:58:52.439 align:start position:0%
because when you look draw it out for a
 
02:58:54.469 --> 02:58:54.479 align:start position:0%
long period of time you find that people
 
02:58:56.809 --> 02:58:56.819 align:start position:0%
become more susceptible to covid and in
 
02:58:58.610 --> 02:58:58.620 align:start position:0%
the UK data and some other countries
 
02:59:01.610 --> 02:59:01.620 align:start position:0%
data but not the U.S data which is not
 
02:59:03.110 --> 02:59:03.120 align:start position:0%
very reliable
 
02:59:05.330 --> 02:59:05.340 align:start position:0%
there are higher mortality rates in the
 
02:59:07.370 --> 02:59:07.380 align:start position:0%
vaccinated so
 
02:59:07.380 --> 02:59:08.150 align:start position:0%
vaccinated so
um

02:59:08.150 --> 02:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:59:10.429 --> 02:59:10.439 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a complicated picture but in
 
02:59:12.170 --> 02:59:12.180 align:start position:0%
the testimonies I will be providing you
 
02:59:15.349 --> 02:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
today I'm giving you data from FDA CDC
 
02:59:18.070 --> 02:59:18.080 align:start position:0%
why don't we deal with those testimonies
 
02:59:20.809 --> 02:59:20.819 align:start position:0%
the appropriate time okay
 
02:59:23.990 --> 02:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
the other relevant to subsequent bills
 
02:59:28.030 --> 02:59:28.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:30.710 --> 02:59:30.720 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman thank you Mr
 
02:59:33.410 --> 02:59:33.420 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for being here
 
02:59:36.650 --> 02:59:36.660 align:start position:0%
um my question is related to
 
02:59:38.630 --> 02:59:38.640 align:start position:0%
um the kind of
 
02:59:42.410 --> 02:59:42.420 align:start position:0%
evolution of medical ethics
 
02:59:44.929 --> 02:59:44.939 align:start position:0%
um it seems that since the beginning of
 
02:59:47.929 --> 02:59:47.939 align:start position:0%
the covet pandemic we have seen the
 
02:59:50.690 --> 02:59:50.700 align:start position:0%
practice of Public Health which used to
 
02:59:53.269 --> 02:59:53.279 align:start position:0%
operate under the um
 
02:59:56.030 --> 02:59:56.040 align:start position:0%
uh the principal
 
02:59:59.630 --> 02:59:59.640 align:start position:0%
where we like I can't remember the name
 
03:00:02.630 --> 03:00:02.640 align:start position:0%
no it's um anyway
 
03:00:04.150 --> 03:00:04.160 align:start position:0%
Public Health
 
03:00:06.370 --> 03:00:06.380 align:start position:0%
precautionary principle thank you ma'am
 
03:00:09.410 --> 03:00:09.420 align:start position:0%
yes so it used to be operated under that
 
03:00:10.730 --> 03:00:10.740 align:start position:0%
principle and it seems like we're
 
03:00:12.950 --> 03:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
stepping away from that
 
03:00:15.230 --> 03:00:15.240 align:start position:0%
um and now it's you know throw a dart
 
03:00:17.750 --> 03:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
and hope that it sticks and I'm just
 
03:00:20.809 --> 03:00:20.819 align:start position:0%
wondering where you see medical ethics
 
03:00:23.210 --> 03:00:23.220 align:start position:0%
going I've seen chipping away at the
 
03:00:25.910 --> 03:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
informed consent process for clinical
 
03:00:29.210 --> 03:00:29.220 align:start position:0%
trials in general with some changes to
 
03:00:29.220 --> 03:00:30.410 align:start position:0%
trials in general with some changes to
the

03:00:30.410 --> 03:00:30.420 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:00:34.790 --> 03:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
um the common rule in 2016 now you don't
 
03:00:36.290 --> 03:00:36.300 align:start position:0%
need to be informed that you're in a
 
03:00:39.590 --> 03:00:39.600 align:start position:0%
clinical trial unless uh the IRB if an
 
03:00:41.870 --> 03:00:41.880 align:start position:0%
IRB votes that you don't need to be in
 
03:00:44.030 --> 03:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
informed that you're enrolled in one and
 
03:00:46.010 --> 03:00:46.020 align:start position:0%
where do you see this going
 
03:00:47.929 --> 03:00:47.939 align:start position:0%
well I think you know what's clear to
 
03:00:49.429 --> 03:00:49.439 align:start position:0%
everybody is that public health has
 
03:00:52.910 --> 03:00:52.920 align:start position:0%
become entirely politicized and
 
03:00:55.670 --> 03:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
um you know it is being run for in some
 
03:00:57.349 --> 03:00:57.359 align:start position:0%
cases commercial interests in some cases
 
03:00:59.269 --> 03:00:59.279 align:start position:0%
political interests
 
03:01:02.450 --> 03:01:02.460 align:start position:0%
um the precautionary principle has in
 
03:01:04.269 --> 03:01:04.279 align:start position:0%
large part been thrown out the window
 
03:01:08.269 --> 03:01:08.279 align:start position:0%
regulation at the FDA it has been
 
03:01:11.330 --> 03:01:11.340 align:start position:0%
eaten away in in certain ways for
 
03:01:13.670 --> 03:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
example project warp speed did not go
 
03:01:18.050 --> 03:01:18.060 align:start position:0%
through normal FDA processes because
 
03:01:20.889 --> 03:01:20.899 align:start position:0%
um because it was an eua and because
 
03:01:23.929 --> 03:01:23.939 align:start position:0%
the manufacturing was run through a
 
03:01:26.929 --> 03:01:26.939 align:start position:0%
military army program
 
03:01:28.849 --> 03:01:28.859 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to point out that in terms
 
03:01:31.010 --> 03:01:31.020 align:start position:0%
of Ebola there's actually a licensed
 
03:01:34.370 --> 03:01:34.380 align:start position:0%
Ebola vaccine in the U.S now FDA
 
03:01:35.990 --> 03:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
licensed it about three years ago it was
 
03:01:38.510 --> 03:01:38.520 align:start position:0%
used in the second largest Ebola
 
03:01:40.429 --> 03:01:40.439 align:start position:0%
epidemic which occurred in the Congo in
 
03:01:43.550 --> 03:01:43.560 align:start position:0%
2018 and 19 and it did not reduce
 
03:01:44.990 --> 03:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
mortality and they had the highest
 
03:01:48.050 --> 03:01:48.060 align:start position:0%
mortality yet of 60 percent in that
 
03:01:48.060 --> 03:01:50.809 align:start position:0%
mortality yet of 60 percent in that
epidemic

03:01:50.809 --> 03:01:50.819 align:start position:0%
epidemic
 
03:01:53.210 --> 03:01:53.220 align:start position:0%
uh you know that's the problem when you
 
03:01:55.610 --> 03:01:55.620 align:start position:0%
look you're licensing vaccines now on
 
03:01:57.590 --> 03:01:57.600 align:start position:0%
the basis of antibody levels and they
 
03:02:00.670 --> 03:02:00.680 align:start position:0%
are not a good surrogate for immunity
 
03:02:02.990 --> 03:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
and yet we're doing that because that's
 
03:02:05.690 --> 03:02:05.700 align:start position:0%
what you can do quickly
 
03:02:07.610 --> 03:02:07.620 align:start position:0%
okay other questions
 
03:02:09.769 --> 03:02:09.779 align:start position:0%
yes representative Nagel thank you Mr
 
03:02:11.630 --> 03:02:11.640 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks for taking my question I
 
03:02:13.309 --> 03:02:13.319 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious I I don't know if you
 
03:02:14.510 --> 03:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
said this uh what is your medical
 
03:02:17.150 --> 03:02:17.160 align:start position:0%
specialty Internal Medicine okay thank
 
03:02:17.160 --> 03:02:18.290 align:start position:0%
specialty Internal Medicine okay thank
you

03:02:18.290 --> 03:02:18.300 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:02:21.410 --> 03:02:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:23.210 --> 03:02:23.220 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing no other questions
 
03:02:26.870 --> 03:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:29.630 --> 03:02:29.640 align:start position:0%
uh we have quite a list of bills to come
 
03:02:32.030 --> 03:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
and we are not uh when we we have a
 
03:02:33.889 --> 03:02:33.899 align:start position:0%
couple more speakers on this bill by the
 
03:02:37.250 --> 03:02:37.260 align:start position:0%
way also uh what I'm thinking
 
03:02:37.260 --> 03:02:37.849 align:start position:0%
way also uh what I'm thinking
um

03:02:37.849 --> 03:02:37.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:02:39.910 --> 03:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
in terms of the committee members
 
03:02:43.130 --> 03:02:43.140 align:start position:0%
perhaps we continue and those who wish
 
03:02:45.490 --> 03:02:45.500 align:start position:0%
to go to lunch may do so
 
03:02:48.650 --> 03:02:48.660 align:start position:0%
and you know obviously those who want to
 
03:02:53.510 --> 03:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
stick it out May do so also so I'm
 
03:02:55.070 --> 03:02:55.080 align:start position:0%
assuming that what you're you're
 
03:02:56.990 --> 03:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
proposing is what we used to call
 
03:02:59.510 --> 03:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
rolling lunch and some of the good good
 
03:03:01.730 --> 03:03:01.740 align:start position:0%
way to folks stay here in some well
 
03:03:03.710 --> 03:03:03.720 align:start position:0%
we'll keep the hearings going and people
 
03:03:06.590 --> 03:03:06.600 align:start position:0%
can go to lunch as as they wish fine
 
03:03:10.550 --> 03:03:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:16.490 --> 03:03:16.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:19.250 --> 03:03:19.260 align:start position:0%
also signed up to testify is Kate Horgan
 
03:03:20.870 --> 03:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire Association of
 
03:03:20.880 --> 03:03:34.190 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire Association of
counties

03:03:34.190 --> 03:03:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:36.290 --> 03:03:36.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair my name is Kate
 
03:03:37.790 --> 03:03:37.800 align:start position:0%
Horgan I represent the New Hampshire
 
03:03:39.650 --> 03:03:39.660 align:start position:0%
Association of counties I don't think
 
03:03:41.090 --> 03:03:41.100 align:start position:0%
I've had the pleasure of being in front
 
03:03:43.429 --> 03:03:43.439 align:start position:0%
of this committee this year yet so just
 
03:03:45.710 --> 03:03:45.720 align:start position:0%
to give you a quick overview of what the
 
03:03:48.950 --> 03:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
association is we represent all of the
 
03:03:51.530 --> 03:03:51.540 align:start position:0%
elected and appointed officials in your
 
03:03:53.750 --> 03:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
County government and specifically in
 
03:03:55.309 --> 03:03:55.319 align:start position:0%
this case I am here for your County
 
03:03:58.849 --> 03:03:58.859 align:start position:0%
nursing homes the association is in
 
03:04:00.650 --> 03:04:00.660 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill and we share
 
03:04:03.349 --> 03:04:03.359 align:start position:0%
many of the same concerns that Dr Chan
 
03:04:05.630 --> 03:04:05.640 align:start position:0%
in the department brought up County
 
03:04:08.090 --> 03:04:08.100 align:start position:0%
nursing homes are sometimes the only
 
03:04:11.210 --> 03:04:11.220 align:start position:0%
ways or options for individuals to get
 
03:04:11.220 --> 03:04:12.309 align:start position:0%
ways or options for individuals to get
Services

03:04:12.309 --> 03:04:12.319 align:start position:0%
Services
 
03:04:15.410 --> 03:04:15.420 align:start position:0%
County homes offer flu vaccines every
 
03:04:18.110 --> 03:04:18.120 align:start position:0%
year and this bill the way it is worded
 
03:04:21.349 --> 03:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
could prevent that in the future in
 
03:04:23.330 --> 03:04:23.340 align:start position:0%
addition this could prevent a resident
 
03:04:26.210 --> 03:04:26.220 align:start position:0%
of a nursing home who is participating
 
03:04:28.370 --> 03:04:28.380 align:start position:0%
in a clinical trial from participating
 
03:04:30.590 --> 03:04:30.600 align:start position:0%
in that clinical trial the way that we
 
03:04:33.469 --> 03:04:33.479 align:start position:0%
read that this bill they may need
 
03:04:34.969 --> 03:04:34.979 align:start position:0%
support or whether that be
 
03:04:38.510 --> 03:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
Transportation or uh
 
03:04:40.790 --> 03:04:40.800 align:start position:0%
delivery of services from the County
 
03:04:42.469 --> 03:04:42.479 align:start position:0%
nursing home does that count as
 
03:04:44.990 --> 03:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
promotion as I read this Bill yes it
 
03:04:47.570 --> 03:04:47.580 align:start position:0%
does finally the association would like
 
03:04:50.210 --> 03:04:50.220 align:start position:0%
to notice that we would oppose any
 
03:04:53.269 --> 03:04:53.279 align:start position:0%
legislation that would create a
 
03:04:55.130 --> 03:04:55.140 align:start position:0%
situation where state and federal
 
03:04:58.130 --> 03:04:58.140 align:start position:0%
statutes are in uh set against one
 
03:05:00.769 --> 03:05:00.779 align:start position:0%
another forcing the counties to choose
 
03:05:03.170 --> 03:05:03.180 align:start position:0%
which set of statutes they are going to
 
03:05:05.870 --> 03:05:05.880 align:start position:0%
follow which could result in dire
 
03:05:07.730 --> 03:05:07.740 align:start position:0%
consequences for the long-term care
 
03:05:10.010 --> 03:05:10.020 align:start position:0%
system in New Hampshire I will conclude
 
03:05:11.630 --> 03:05:11.640 align:start position:0%
my testimony because they are far more
 
03:05:13.910 --> 03:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
expert people behind me coming but I'm
 
03:05:15.530 --> 03:05:15.540 align:start position:0%
happy to try and answer any questions
 
03:05:17.750 --> 03:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
that the committee has representative
 
03:05:19.790 --> 03:05:19.800 align:start position:0%
Leon thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
03:05:21.349 --> 03:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
very much welcome to the committee this
 
03:05:21.359 --> 03:05:22.429 align:start position:0%
very much welcome to the committee this
year

03:05:22.429 --> 03:05:22.439 align:start position:0%
year
 
03:05:24.050 --> 03:05:24.060 align:start position:0%
um that caught my ear that there may be
 
03:05:26.269 --> 03:05:26.279 align:start position:0%
some conflicting Federal statutes if you
 
03:05:27.469 --> 03:05:27.479 align:start position:0%
don't know them off the top of your head
 
03:05:28.910 --> 03:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
I'd appreciate if you could send them to
 
03:05:31.250 --> 03:05:31.260 align:start position:0%
us I would be happy to look into that
 
03:05:33.050 --> 03:05:33.060 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you
 
03:05:34.910 --> 03:05:34.920 align:start position:0%
representative palazzov
 
03:05:37.010 --> 03:05:37.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
03:05:39.769 --> 03:05:39.779 align:start position:0%
taking my question if we still try to
 
03:05:42.769 --> 03:05:42.779 align:start position:0%
save this uh Bill what would you propose
 
03:05:45.530 --> 03:05:45.540 align:start position:0%
you mentioned uh clinical trials so
 
03:05:49.370 --> 03:05:49.380 align:start position:0%
maybe we can write the amendment to put
 
03:05:53.030 --> 03:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
exception for clinical trial but other
 
03:05:55.730 --> 03:05:55.740 align:start position:0%
any other specific things that we can
 
03:05:58.250 --> 03:05:58.260 align:start position:0%
add to this build to make it more
 
03:06:00.769 --> 03:06:00.779 align:start position:0%
tolerable thank you representative for
 
03:06:02.450 --> 03:06:02.460 align:start position:0%
the question I believe you will find
 
03:06:04.670 --> 03:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
last year in several of the bills this
 
03:06:07.630 --> 03:06:07.640 align:start position:0%
body did put exemption language in for
 
03:06:10.370 --> 03:06:10.380 align:start position:0%
uh long-term care facilities and we
 
03:06:11.809 --> 03:06:11.819 align:start position:0%
would recommend that you include that
 
03:06:14.030 --> 03:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
language in this bill
 
03:06:17.210 --> 03:06:17.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:19.670 --> 03:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions
 
03:06:25.130 --> 03:06:25.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:28.070 --> 03:06:28.080 align:start position:0%

thank you for the opportunity to speak
 
03:06:51.710 --> 03:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
to the committee
 
03:06:53.570 --> 03:06:53.580 align:start position:0%
um Jeffrey Federer I'm the chief medical
 
03:06:56.510 --> 03:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
officer at New Hampshire hospital
 
03:06:59.990 --> 03:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
um and um I want to speak about the
 
03:07:02.990 --> 03:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
impact of this bill on our patients and
 
03:07:05.330 --> 03:07:05.340 align:start position:0%
our institution patients with severe and
 
03:07:07.550 --> 03:07:07.560 align:start position:0%
persistent mental illness have a 25-year
 
03:07:10.490 --> 03:07:10.500 align:start position:0%
lower life expectancy primarily due to
 
03:07:13.490 --> 03:07:13.500 align:start position:0%
medical illness not suicide or homicide
 
03:07:15.670 --> 03:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
or other injuries
 
03:07:18.590 --> 03:07:18.600 align:start position:0%
and access to Medical Care is the
 
03:07:20.590 --> 03:07:20.600 align:start position:0%
primary reason that
 
03:07:24.429 --> 03:07:24.439 align:start position:0%
medical morbidity exists
 
03:07:27.050 --> 03:07:27.060 align:start position:0%
we know that patients with severe and
 
03:07:28.250 --> 03:07:28.260 align:start position:0%
persistent mental illness have
 
03:07:31.849 --> 03:07:31.859 align:start position:0%
difficulty accessing flu vaccination and
 
03:07:34.010 --> 03:07:34.020 align:start position:0%
as you have heard in previous testimony
 
03:07:36.710 --> 03:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
this bill as written would present an
 
03:07:40.130 --> 03:07:40.140 align:start position:0%
obstacle to our providing flu
 
03:07:41.769 --> 03:07:41.779 align:start position:0%
vaccination and potentially other
 
03:07:46.090 --> 03:07:46.100 align:start position:0%
relevant vaccinations to our patients
 
03:07:50.150 --> 03:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
I also am concerned from the standpoint
 
03:07:50.160 --> 03:07:51.230 align:start position:0%
I also am concerned from the standpoint
that

03:07:51.230 --> 03:07:51.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:07:53.090 --> 03:07:53.100 align:start position:0%
if a patient were not at New Hampshire
 
03:07:55.250 --> 03:07:55.260 align:start position:0%
hospital in the same situation they
 
03:07:58.130 --> 03:07:58.140 align:start position:0%
would be able to obtain a flu
 
03:08:00.769 --> 03:08:00.779 align:start position:0%
vaccination otherwise this may expose
 
03:08:02.389 --> 03:08:02.399 align:start position:0%
the state to
 
03:08:04.610 --> 03:08:04.620 align:start position:0%
um a violation of the Americans with
 
03:08:07.429 --> 03:08:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:10.429 --> 03:08:10.439 align:start position:0%
um conjugate congregate living of the
 
03:08:11.570 --> 03:08:11.580 align:start position:0%
sort that happens at New Hampshire
 
03:08:15.050 --> 03:08:15.060 align:start position:0%
hospital Glencliff home and group homes
 
03:08:17.389 --> 03:08:17.399 align:start position:0%
where many of our patients reside our
 
03:08:19.070 --> 03:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
high-risk situations for Respiratory
 
03:08:20.809 --> 03:08:20.819 align:start position:0%
illness and vaccinations a very
 
03:08:22.550 --> 03:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
important tool
 
03:08:24.650 --> 03:08:24.660 align:start position:0%
um our ability to to provide these
 
03:08:26.150 --> 03:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
vaccinations to eat mechanisms is
 
03:08:26.160 --> 03:08:28.250 align:start position:0%
vaccinations to eat mechanisms is
important

03:08:28.250 --> 03:08:28.260 align:start position:0%
important
 
03:08:31.190 --> 03:08:31.200 align:start position:0%
um I am concerned also about the um the
 
03:08:33.349 --> 03:08:33.359 align:start position:0%
promotion language in this bill from the
 
03:08:34.969 --> 03:08:34.979 align:start position:0%
standpoint that it could be interpreted
 
03:08:38.809 --> 03:08:38.819 align:start position:0%
to make it difficult or prohibited for
 
03:08:40.370 --> 03:08:40.380 align:start position:0%
um State Physicians and nurse
 
03:08:40.380 --> 03:08:41.510 align:start position:0%
um State Physicians and nurse
practitioners

03:08:41.510 --> 03:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
practitioners
 
03:08:43.670 --> 03:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
and nurses to have Frank conversations
 
03:08:45.889 --> 03:08:45.899 align:start position:0%
with our patients about the risks and
 
03:08:48.950 --> 03:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
benefits of vaccination
 
03:08:50.750 --> 03:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
finally I want to address the issue of
 
03:08:54.230 --> 03:08:54.240 align:start position:0%
informed consent in this population
 
03:08:56.510 --> 03:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
um in form of consent is something we
 
03:08:59.210 --> 03:08:59.220 align:start position:0%
take really seriously uh in an
 
03:09:01.070 --> 03:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
environment where there is an element of
 
03:09:03.790 --> 03:09:03.800 align:start position:0%
coercion there's an involuntary
 
03:09:06.349 --> 03:09:06.359 align:start position:0%
hospitalization and and other legal
 
03:09:08.769 --> 03:09:08.779 align:start position:0%
constrictions on folks we
 
03:09:12.710 --> 03:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
have very uh strict procedures to ensure
 
03:09:14.950 --> 03:09:14.960 align:start position:0%
that Guardians and
 
03:09:16.910 --> 03:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
capacity medical decision-making
 
03:09:19.070 --> 03:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
capacity uh considerations are addressed
 
03:09:21.530 --> 03:09:21.540 align:start position:0%
properly so that that is that is a part
 
03:09:23.510 --> 03:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
of the fabric of how Medical Care is
 
03:09:25.070 --> 03:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
delivered not just about vaccination
 
03:09:28.849 --> 03:09:28.859 align:start position:0%
about everything in our Institution
 
03:09:31.550 --> 03:09:31.560 align:start position:0%
so I'll keep my comments brief and be
 
03:09:33.410 --> 03:09:33.420 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions thank you
 
03:09:36.110 --> 03:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
any questions yes representative Shapiro
 
03:09:39.230 --> 03:09:39.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and um just so I'm
 
03:09:41.389 --> 03:09:41.399 align:start position:0%
understanding completely
 
03:09:43.370 --> 03:09:43.380 align:start position:0%
um I had a relative who lived for a long
 
03:09:45.530 --> 03:09:45.540 align:start position:0%
time until he passed away at Glen Cliff
 
03:09:45.540 --> 03:09:46.490 align:start position:0%
time until he passed away at Glen Cliff
home

03:09:46.490 --> 03:09:46.500 align:start position:0%
home
 
03:09:49.490 --> 03:09:49.500 align:start position:0%
um where he got fantastic care
 
03:09:49.500 --> 03:09:50.929 align:start position:0%
um where he got fantastic care
um

03:09:50.929 --> 03:09:50.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:09:54.530 --> 03:09:54.540 align:start position:0%
you know he had a guardian and um so
 
03:09:56.630 --> 03:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
informed consent would have gone in that
 
03:09:59.210 --> 03:09:59.220 align:start position:0%
direction but are you saying that
 
03:10:02.330 --> 03:10:02.340 align:start position:0%
um for for that population for my
 
03:10:04.790 --> 03:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
relative that um
 
03:10:07.190 --> 03:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
the covet vaccine and flu vaccine just
 
03:10:09.530 --> 03:10:09.540 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be available to them
 
03:10:12.530 --> 03:10:12.540 align:start position:0%
if this law was to be passed that that
 
03:10:15.050 --> 03:10:15.060 align:start position:0%
is the way it appears that the intention
 
03:10:19.130 --> 03:10:19.140 align:start position:0%
of the bill is and I suspect that the
 
03:10:21.469 --> 03:10:21.479 align:start position:0%
from the previous testimony that flu
 
03:10:23.210 --> 03:10:23.220 align:start position:0%
vaccination was not intended to be
 
03:10:25.250 --> 03:10:25.260 align:start position:0%
included but but the plain language
 
03:10:30.050 --> 03:10:30.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:34.490 --> 03:10:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:39.830 --> 03:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:39.840 --> 03:10:40.550 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:10:40.550 --> 03:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
03:10:43.790 --> 03:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Kate pray
 
03:10:45.469 --> 03:10:45.479 align:start position:0%
from new futures
 
03:10:46.910 --> 03:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
hopefully I pronounce that name
 
03:10:46.920 --> 03:10:53.570 align:start position:0%
hopefully I pronounce that name
correctly

03:10:53.570 --> 03:10:53.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:55.910 --> 03:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
close enough it's Frye what that's it's
 
03:10:58.610 --> 03:10:58.620 align:start position:0%
spelled Fray so I understand I think we
 
03:11:00.650 --> 03:11:00.660 align:start position:0%
should keep your testimony I have
 
03:11:02.450 --> 03:11:02.460 align:start position:0%
written testimony so I'll be about two
 
03:11:03.950 --> 03:11:03.960 align:start position:0%
minutes I'll leave you my testimony
 
03:11:06.590 --> 03:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
again Kate Frye from I'm the vice
 
03:11:08.990 --> 03:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
president of advocacy at new Futures new
 
03:11:11.090 --> 03:11:11.100 align:start position:0%
features that poses this bill we work
 
03:11:14.330 --> 03:11:14.340 align:start position:0%
very closely with uh partners and policy
 
03:11:14.340 --> 03:11:15.530 align:start position:0%
very closely with uh partners and policy
makers

03:11:15.530 --> 03:11:15.540 align:start position:0%
makers
 
03:11:17.929 --> 03:11:17.939 align:start position:0%
um on to improve overall public health
 
03:11:19.969 --> 03:11:19.979 align:start position:0%
and improve health Equity across the
 
03:11:22.190 --> 03:11:22.200 align:start position:0%
granite state we agree with concerns
 
03:11:24.110 --> 03:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
from the department and others who spoke
 
03:11:27.349 --> 03:11:27.359 align:start position:0%
about the lack of clarity to this will
 
03:11:29.570 --> 03:11:29.580 align:start position:0%
and one of the major concerns we would
 
03:11:32.870 --> 03:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
have is um the affecting
 
03:11:35.269 --> 03:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
um really important valuable and
 
03:11:37.610 --> 03:11:37.620 align:start position:0%
effective programs such as a vaccine for
 
03:11:40.309 --> 03:11:40.319 align:start position:0%
children program in New Hampshire
 
03:11:42.349 --> 03:11:42.359 align:start position:0%
um what would would be concerned about
 
03:11:45.410 --> 03:11:45.420 align:start position:0%
the impact if the state could not
 
03:11:47.870 --> 03:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
provide those at a reduced cost to our
 
03:11:49.370 --> 03:11:49.380 align:start position:0%
communities and therefore that cost
 
03:11:52.250 --> 03:11:52.260 align:start position:0%
would be passed on to families and just
 
03:11:54.469 --> 03:11:54.479 align:start position:0%
to keep them mind that vaccines
 
03:11:57.290 --> 03:11:57.300 align:start position:0%
particularly for children are one of the
 
03:11:59.450 --> 03:11:59.460 align:start position:0%
number one Public Health accomplishments
 
03:12:03.290 --> 03:12:03.300 align:start position:0%
over time and has prevented diseases
 
03:12:05.510 --> 03:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
such as polio mumps measles the list
 
03:12:09.230 --> 03:12:09.240 align:start position:0%
goes on and for a bill that doesn't have
 
03:12:11.870 --> 03:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
um the proper intent there could be some
 
03:12:14.330 --> 03:12:14.340 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences I'm happy to
 
03:12:15.769 --> 03:12:15.779 align:start position:0%
leave my testimony with the committee
 
03:12:17.690 --> 03:12:17.700 align:start position:0%
that'd be great thank you
 
03:12:21.230 --> 03:12:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:25.570 --> 03:12:25.580 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
03:12:38.880 --> 03:12:39.889 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

03:12:39.889 --> 03:12:39.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:12:42.590 --> 03:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
mine is a question
 
03:12:45.469 --> 03:12:45.479 align:start position:0%
um to some of these people that make the
 
03:12:48.110 --> 03:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
decisions for us
 
03:12:48.120 --> 03:12:49.490 align:start position:0%
decisions for us
um

03:12:49.490 --> 03:12:49.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:12:52.309 --> 03:12:52.319 align:start position:0%
why did the FDA try to seal the coveted
 
03:12:54.410 --> 03:12:54.420 align:start position:0%
vaccine research documents including
 
03:12:57.769 --> 03:12:57.779 align:start position:0%
trial results documents for 75 years and
 
03:12:59.690 --> 03:12:59.700 align:start position:0%
why did it take a court order to release
 
03:13:01.429 --> 03:13:01.439 align:start position:0%
these documents which are now being
 
03:13:03.950 --> 03:13:03.960 align:start position:0%
studied by a team of over 3 500
 
03:13:06.650 --> 03:13:06.660 align:start position:0%
researchers under Naomi wolf with very
 
03:13:08.929 --> 03:13:08.939 align:start position:0%
concerning findings and why should the
 
03:13:11.570 --> 03:13:11.580 align:start position:0%
public have any trust for information if
 
03:13:13.429 --> 03:13:13.439 align:start position:0%
it is not allowed if we're not allowed
 
03:13:14.690 --> 03:13:14.700 align:start position:0%
to see it
 
03:13:14.700 --> 03:13:18.950 align:start position:0%
to see it
and

03:13:18.950 --> 03:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:18.960 --> 03:13:22.070 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

03:13:22.070 --> 03:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:24.170 --> 03:13:24.180 align:start position:0%
and that's really um does anybody have
 
03:13:25.670 --> 03:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
questions for me oh okay that was quick
 
03:13:28.910 --> 03:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
uh any questions at all
 
03:13:34.070 --> 03:13:34.080 align:start position:0%

hi my name is Therese Grinnell I
 
03:15:05.150 --> 03:15:05.160 align:start position:0%
appreciate the time to speak I am a
 
03:15:06.950 --> 03:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
hospice nurse I live in Loudoun New
 
03:15:06.960 --> 03:15:08.510 align:start position:0%
hospice nurse I live in Loudoun New
Hampshire

03:15:08.510 --> 03:15:08.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:15:10.250 --> 03:15:10.260 align:start position:0%
um I have a few quick comments just
 
03:15:12.250 --> 03:15:12.260 align:start position:0%
based on the testimonies that I've heard
 
03:15:15.469 --> 03:15:15.479 align:start position:0%
one as clinicians we take an oath to
 
03:15:17.630 --> 03:15:17.640 align:start position:0%
office we take an oath not to do any
 
03:15:17.640 --> 03:15:18.530 align:start position:0%
office we take an oath not to do any
harm

03:15:18.530 --> 03:15:18.540 align:start position:0%
harm
 
03:15:21.650 --> 03:15:21.660 align:start position:0%
so what I saw in the last two years is a
 
03:15:23.330 --> 03:15:23.340 align:start position:0%
lot of clinicians including this doctor
 
03:15:25.910 --> 03:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
that gave up her entire livelihood and
 
03:15:27.710 --> 03:15:27.720 align:start position:0%
everything she worked for
 
03:15:29.630 --> 03:15:29.640 align:start position:0%
to be able to try and prescribe
 
03:15:31.910 --> 03:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
medications or give the opportunity to
 
03:15:34.849 --> 03:15:34.859 align:start position:0%
her patients to try something that was a
 
03:15:38.210 --> 03:15:38.220 align:start position:0%
known medication why that was stifled is
 
03:15:40.429 --> 03:15:40.439 align:start position:0%
a question all of us have to ask because
 
03:15:41.750 --> 03:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
the science is there that those
 
03:15:43.910 --> 03:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
medications worked
 
03:15:47.690 --> 03:15:47.700 align:start position:0%
these vaccines we are seeing tremendous
 
03:15:50.450 --> 03:15:50.460 align:start position:0%
tremendous Fallout
 
03:15:53.210 --> 03:15:53.220 align:start position:0%
there was a documentary that my nursing
 
03:15:55.429 --> 03:15:55.439 align:start position:0%
instructor had us watch before we
 
03:15:57.530 --> 03:15:57.540 align:start position:0%
graduated and I would encourage all of
 
03:15:59.570 --> 03:15:59.580 align:start position:0%
you to take the time to look at it this
 
03:16:01.910 --> 03:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
was 15 years ago and I am so glad she
 
03:16:04.370 --> 03:16:04.380 align:start position:0%
had me watch it it was called the caring
 
03:16:06.710 --> 03:16:06.720 align:start position:0%
corrupt corrupted nurses of the Third
 
03:16:09.349 --> 03:16:09.359 align:start position:0%
Reich and it talks about how the
 
03:16:09.359 --> 03:16:10.309 align:start position:0%
Reich and it talks about how the
government

03:16:10.309 --> 03:16:10.319 align:start position:0%
government
 
03:16:14.150 --> 03:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
actually came in and the elderly and the
 
03:16:16.790 --> 03:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
mentally unstable that were in these
 
03:16:18.889 --> 03:16:18.899 align:start position:0%
facilities were the first that they
 
03:16:22.010 --> 03:16:22.020 align:start position:0%
tried to go ahead and do away with
 
03:16:24.050 --> 03:16:24.060 align:start position:0%
I don't care if I sound like a
 
03:16:25.910 --> 03:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
conspiracy theorist but I'm here to tell
 
03:16:27.889 --> 03:16:27.899 align:start position:0%
you that is exactly what I am witnessing
 
03:16:29.510 --> 03:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
in my practice
 
03:16:31.910 --> 03:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
and I'm not ashamed to say it
 
03:16:34.910 --> 03:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
we have children and families who trust
 
03:16:37.130 --> 03:16:37.140 align:start position:0%
the government that these vaccine mobile
 
03:16:39.769 --> 03:16:39.779 align:start position:0%
clinics mean that this is safe for their
 
03:16:39.779 --> 03:16:41.030 align:start position:0%
clinics mean that this is safe for their
child

03:16:41.030 --> 03:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
child
 
03:16:44.630 --> 03:16:44.640 align:start position:0%
only to see four children die in New
 
03:16:49.130 --> 03:16:49.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:51.410 --> 03:16:51.420 align:start position:0%
we are going to have to take account as
 
03:16:53.210 --> 03:16:53.220 align:start position:0%
the history Marches On whether we rush
 
03:16:55.670 --> 03:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
to Market this intervention
 
03:16:57.469 --> 03:16:57.479 align:start position:0%
whether or not there was something else
 
03:16:59.929 --> 03:16:59.939 align:start position:0%
therapeutic that we denied the right for
 
03:17:01.490 --> 03:17:01.500 align:start position:0%
people to try
 
03:17:03.769 --> 03:17:03.779 align:start position:0%
I have so many clinicians one that left
 
03:17:06.769 --> 03:17:06.779 align:start position:0%
Concord Hospital she got an email if you
 
03:17:08.929 --> 03:17:08.939 align:start position:0%
prescribe this medication you will be
 
03:17:11.750 --> 03:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
put on notice you will lose your license
 
03:17:13.969 --> 03:17:13.979 align:start position:0%
since when are we taking it away from
 
03:17:15.830 --> 03:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
the doctors and the nurses and the
 
03:17:18.050 --> 03:17:18.060 align:start position:0%
clinicians who took an oath to do no
 
03:17:20.690 --> 03:17:20.700 align:start position:0%
harm and now we're forcing them to
 
03:17:22.490 --> 03:17:22.500 align:start position:0%
actually do harm
 
03:17:24.710 --> 03:17:24.720 align:start position:0%
to withhold a medication that might work
 
03:17:26.990 --> 03:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
as soon as someone's symptomatic or to
 
03:17:29.210 --> 03:17:29.220 align:start position:0%
force the vaccine or encourage a vaccine
 
03:17:32.450 --> 03:17:32.460 align:start position:0%
or Market falsely a vaccine that's going
 
03:17:34.790 --> 03:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
to keep you from getting this virus when
 
03:17:38.389 --> 03:17:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:40.910 --> 03:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
as far as the County homes and the
 
03:17:43.070 --> 03:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
nursing homes and the mental health
 
03:17:43.080 --> 03:17:44.510 align:start position:0%
nursing homes and the mental health
hospital

03:17:44.510 --> 03:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
03:17:47.630 --> 03:17:47.640 align:start position:0%
each of those patients is under they're
 
03:17:49.309 --> 03:17:49.319 align:start position:0%
assigned a provider
 
03:17:51.349 --> 03:17:51.359 align:start position:0%
it is between that provider and that
 
03:17:53.809 --> 03:17:53.819 align:start position:0%
patient to have informed consent whether
 
03:17:55.790 --> 03:17:55.800 align:start position:0%
it be with a guardian or a family member
 
03:17:58.370 --> 03:17:58.380 align:start position:0%
who's cognitively intact to understand
 
03:18:00.410 --> 03:18:00.420 align:start position:0%
the options of treatment and the risk
 
03:18:02.630 --> 03:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
and reward for each of those
 
03:18:05.170 --> 03:18:05.180 align:start position:0%
that is not something that a government
 
03:18:08.389 --> 03:18:08.399 align:start position:0%
should be
 
03:18:11.269 --> 03:18:11.279 align:start position:0%
falsely leading young parents
 
03:18:14.210 --> 03:18:14.220 align:start position:0%
family members and everyone else to
 
03:18:16.550 --> 03:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
believe is safe
 
03:18:18.590 --> 03:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
there's a responsibility to each of you
 
03:18:21.530 --> 03:18:21.540 align:start position:0%
here to your constituents and I would
 
03:18:23.510 --> 03:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
just beg that we would pause and make
 
03:18:25.370 --> 03:18:25.380 align:start position:0%
sure that we're not doing harm
 
03:18:27.050 --> 03:18:27.060 align:start position:0%
that you take a moment to watch that
 
03:18:27.060 --> 03:18:28.309 align:start position:0%
that you take a moment to watch that
documentary

03:18:28.309 --> 03:18:28.319 align:start position:0%
documentary
 
03:18:30.710 --> 03:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
it's not anything new it's not just some
 
03:18:32.870 --> 03:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
random Youtube it was my nursing
 
03:18:35.330 --> 03:18:35.340 align:start position:0%
instructor at nhti that wanted to make
 
03:18:37.610 --> 03:18:37.620 align:start position:0%
sure that I watched that and if I had
 
03:18:39.170 --> 03:18:39.180 align:start position:0%
not watched that I would not have had
 
03:18:41.269 --> 03:18:41.279 align:start position:0%
the red flags go off the way that they
 
03:18:43.670 --> 03:18:43.680 align:start position:0%
did for me and I'm glad that I stood up
 
03:18:45.230 --> 03:18:45.240 align:start position:0%
and said whoa
 
03:18:47.690 --> 03:18:47.700 align:start position:0%
there might be risk here
 
03:18:49.969 --> 03:18:49.979 align:start position:0%
and I'm sad when I go into The Birches
 
03:18:52.070 --> 03:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
and one of the nurses says hey T are you
 
03:18:53.690 --> 03:18:53.700 align:start position:0%
still standing up
 
03:18:56.090 --> 03:18:56.100 align:start position:0%
about the vaccines I saw you on the
 
03:18:58.309 --> 03:18:58.319 align:start position:0%
corner well it kind of evolved from
 
03:19:00.110 --> 03:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
there she goes well I wish I would have
 
03:19:01.969 --> 03:19:01.979 align:start position:0%
stood with you and she points to arm
 
03:19:01.979 --> 03:19:03.849 align:start position:0%
stood with you and she points to arm
crutches

03:19:03.849 --> 03:19:03.859 align:start position:0%
crutches
 
03:19:06.650 --> 03:19:06.660 align:start position:0%
she can no longer ambulate without
 
03:19:08.870 --> 03:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
crutches and she once used to hike all
 
03:19:10.969 --> 03:19:10.979 align:start position:0%
of our mountains
 
03:19:13.730 --> 03:19:13.740 align:start position:0%
it's a reality these vaccines and these
 
03:19:15.349 --> 03:19:15.359 align:start position:0%
boosters are doing harm
 
03:19:17.750 --> 03:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
and we need to be aware of that thank
 
03:19:19.010 --> 03:19:19.020 align:start position:0%
you for your time thank you any
 
03:19:19.020 --> 03:19:21.469 align:start position:0%
you for your time thank you any
questions

03:19:21.469 --> 03:19:21.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:23.389 --> 03:19:23.399 align:start position:0%
representative Palazzo are you taking
 
03:19:25.250 --> 03:19:25.260 align:start position:0%
questions ma'am or
 
03:19:27.830 --> 03:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
are you taking questions or you don't
 
03:19:29.590 --> 03:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
have to if you don't want any questions
 
03:19:33.050 --> 03:19:33.060 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman and
 
03:19:36.710 --> 03:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh am I
 
03:19:40.309 --> 03:19:40.319 align:start position:0%
right in understanding that those four
 
03:19:43.929 --> 03:19:43.939 align:start position:0%
cases of minus uh dying in New Hampshire
 
03:19:47.389 --> 03:19:47.399 align:start position:0%
after receiving a covet vaccines that
 
03:19:49.790 --> 03:19:49.800 align:start position:0%
those four cases the officially
 
03:19:53.990 --> 03:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
documented in the wireless database
 
03:19:57.410 --> 03:19:57.420 align:start position:0%
so the virus reporting does have the
 
03:19:59.210 --> 03:19:59.220 align:start position:0%
cause of death
 
03:20:02.210 --> 03:20:02.220 align:start position:0%
as related to the vaccine if that's the
 
03:20:04.670 --> 03:20:04.680 align:start position:0%
question so yes it is well documented
 
03:20:07.849 --> 03:20:07.859 align:start position:0%
through representative Cushman
 
03:20:09.050 --> 03:20:09.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
03:20:10.670 --> 03:20:10.680 align:start position:0%
being here
 
03:20:12.950 --> 03:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
um so to your point about in the County
 
03:20:15.170 --> 03:20:15.180 align:start position:0%
nursing homes and you know where we see
 
03:20:17.630 --> 03:20:17.640 align:start position:0%
that we may have this conflict if we put
 
03:20:19.250 --> 03:20:19.260 align:start position:0%
something in the bill to say that this
 
03:20:22.730 --> 03:20:22.740 align:start position:0%
does not apply to you know a pace
 
03:20:24.650 --> 03:20:24.660 align:start position:0%
provider patient
 
03:20:28.510 --> 03:20:28.520 align:start position:0%
decision making that if a physician
 
03:20:30.830 --> 03:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
truly believes that they should be
 
03:20:32.630 --> 03:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
promoting this that they can have the
 
03:20:34.490 --> 03:20:34.500 align:start position:0%
conversation with their patients and
 
03:20:37.250 --> 03:20:37.260 align:start position:0%
that way it can put that concern to rest
 
03:20:39.650 --> 03:20:39.660 align:start position:0%
yeah I believe informed consent is part
 
03:20:42.110 --> 03:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
of the way that we make sure that our
 
03:20:43.849 --> 03:20:43.859 align:start position:0%
patients know the risk reward it's
 
03:20:45.710 --> 03:20:45.720 align:start position:0%
always been you know how we are supposed
 
03:20:47.870 --> 03:20:47.880 align:start position:0%
to practice and we've taken that away
 
03:20:50.389 --> 03:20:50.399 align:start position:0%
and I think that's very dangerous in
 
03:20:52.849 --> 03:20:52.859 align:start position:0%
addition you have people who desperately
 
03:20:55.550 --> 03:20:55.560 align:start position:0%
need to be in these facilities and they
 
03:20:57.469 --> 03:20:57.479 align:start position:0%
cannot be accepted into one of those
 
03:21:00.590 --> 03:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
beds unless they get this vaccine to me
 
03:21:01.910 --> 03:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
that is
 
03:21:04.429 --> 03:21:04.439 align:start position:0%
which is horrible if I have a family
 
03:21:06.590 --> 03:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
member that needs mental health crisis
 
03:21:07.910 --> 03:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
and needs to be at the New Hampshire
 
03:21:10.309 --> 03:21:10.319 align:start position:0%
state hospital or needs to be at
 
03:21:12.769 --> 03:21:12.779 align:start position:0%
Merrimack County nursing home for care
 
03:21:14.690 --> 03:21:14.700 align:start position:0%
they're forced to take something into
 
03:21:17.269 --> 03:21:17.279 align:start position:0%
their body that we don't know isn't
 
03:21:19.429 --> 03:21:19.439 align:start position:0%
going to harm them
 
03:21:21.950 --> 03:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
to me that's discrimination that's
 
03:21:24.410 --> 03:21:24.420 align:start position:0%
that's putting this person into a place
 
03:21:26.570 --> 03:21:26.580 align:start position:0%
where they have to do something that we
 
03:21:28.790 --> 03:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
don't have informed consent for them to
 
03:21:31.670 --> 03:21:31.680 align:start position:0%
even it just it's dangerous
 
03:21:35.210 --> 03:21:35.220 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you um what you what you
 
03:21:37.670 --> 03:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
just said is pretty striking so
 
03:21:39.590 --> 03:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
um and I'm not aware of this happening
 
03:21:42.110 --> 03:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
so enlighten me if it is
 
03:21:44.510 --> 03:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
um are you saying that some patients are
 
03:21:47.809 --> 03:21:47.819 align:start position:0%
being denied beds at these facilities if
 
03:21:50.330 --> 03:21:50.340 align:start position:0%
they don't receive the vaccinations my
 
03:21:52.429 --> 03:21:52.439 align:start position:0%
understanding is many of our almost all
 
03:21:54.410 --> 03:21:54.420 align:start position:0%
of our nursing home facilities in New
 
03:21:56.330 --> 03:21:56.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire require that the patient be
 
03:21:58.309 --> 03:21:58.319 align:start position:0%
completely vaccinated and boosted and
 
03:22:00.290 --> 03:22:00.300 align:start position:0%
they're not able to get an exemption in
 
03:22:04.010 --> 03:22:04.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:07.130 --> 03:22:07.140 align:start position:0%
which is dangerous to me thank you other
 
03:22:07.140 --> 03:22:09.710 align:start position:0%
which is dangerous to me thank you other
questions

03:22:09.710 --> 03:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:11.870 --> 03:22:11.880 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing no other questions okay thank
 
03:22:15.469 --> 03:22:15.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:17.990 --> 03:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
I have a partially completed card
 
03:22:20.090 --> 03:22:20.100 align:start position:0%
indicating somebody supported the bill
 
03:22:23.210 --> 03:22:23.220 align:start position:0%
but nobody put their name on it
 
03:22:24.830 --> 03:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
um I mean we have a blue sheet over
 
03:22:26.150 --> 03:22:26.160 align:start position:0%
there you can sign in just Express
 
03:22:29.630 --> 03:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
support if you don't want to testify
 
03:22:31.670 --> 03:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
um so again I don't have any name on
 
03:22:33.950 --> 03:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
this card no one else has signed up to
 
03:22:37.070 --> 03:22:37.080 align:start position:0%

03:23:00.230 --> 03:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:03.230 --> 03:23:03.240 align:start position:0%
I've heard a lot about it a microphone

03:23:20.929 --> 03:23:20.939 align:start position:0%
okay you have three minutes okay I've
 
03:23:23.150 --> 03:23:23.160 align:start position:0%
heard a lot about it informed consent
 
03:23:25.070 --> 03:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
here which is addressed by this bill
 
03:23:28.849 --> 03:23:28.859 align:start position:0%
because uh because of the term promotion
 
03:23:33.830 --> 03:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
that's in it and uh I would I would I
 
03:23:37.750 --> 03:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
would uh assert that the
 
03:23:41.090 --> 03:23:41.100 align:start position:0%
promotion is disinformation it's
 
03:23:45.050 --> 03:23:45.060 align:start position:0%
disinformed consent I have I have a
 
03:23:48.490 --> 03:23:48.500 align:start position:0%
I have a document here and it's from
 
03:23:54.889 --> 03:23:54.899 align:start position:0%
two uh Ohio uh or Oregon State Senators
 
03:23:57.410 --> 03:23:57.420 align:start position:0%
and they um
 
03:24:00.950 --> 03:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
it's a formal grand jury petition sent
 
03:24:03.530 --> 03:24:03.540 align:start position:0%
to the Department of Justice Biden's
 
03:24:06.110 --> 03:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice it was sent in
 
03:24:09.769 --> 03:24:09.779 align:start position:0%
October of 2021.
 
03:24:11.990 --> 03:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
and what it what it describes I'm a
 
03:24:14.630 --> 03:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
statistician by the way I'm a uh I'm a
 
03:24:18.650 --> 03:24:18.660 align:start position:0%
graduate of MIT mathematics I uh I have
 
03:24:20.990 --> 03:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
an MBA from Columbia University in
 
03:24:23.210 --> 03:24:23.220 align:start position:0%
finance okay that's uh much of my
 
03:24:24.110 --> 03:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
credentials I have no medical
 
03:24:24.120 --> 03:24:26.269 align:start position:0%
credentials I have no medical
credentials

03:24:26.269 --> 03:24:26.279 align:start position:0%
credentials
 
03:24:28.550 --> 03:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
um but this um
 
03:24:30.910 --> 03:24:30.920 align:start position:0%
they talk about statistical
 
03:24:33.229 --> 03:24:33.239 align:start position:0%
irregularities that have been used to
 
03:24:36.170 --> 03:24:36.180 align:start position:0%
establish public health policies that
 
03:24:39.950 --> 03:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
infringe upon the con constitutionally
 
03:24:41.809 --> 03:24:41.819 align:start position:0%
protected civil liberties of the
 
03:24:44.330 --> 03:24:44.340 align:start position:0%
citizens and represent irregularities
 
03:24:46.610 --> 03:24:46.620 align:start position:0%
that have laid to Major collateral
 
03:24:49.450 --> 03:24:49.460 align:start position:0%
damage including but not limited to one
 
03:24:51.950 --> 03:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
historic small business laws and
 
03:24:54.769 --> 03:24:54.779 align:start position:0%
Community economic collapse two
 
03:24:56.990 --> 03:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
unacceptable rises in mental illness
 
03:25:00.710 --> 03:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
drug abuse and suicide rates now this is
 
03:25:03.530 --> 03:25:03.540 align:start position:0%
they're saying that this is what let
 
03:25:05.510 --> 03:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
What's led to that now we're looking for
 
03:25:07.250 --> 03:25:07.260 align:start position:0%
one of the other bills we're looking for
 
03:25:09.290 --> 03:25:09.300 align:start position:0%
the cures for these things but these are
 
03:25:10.729 --> 03:25:10.739 align:start position:0%
the this is a source you have to get rid
 
03:25:10.739 --> 03:25:11.750 align:start position:0%
the this is a source you have to get rid
of

03:25:11.750 --> 03:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:25:14.389 --> 03:25:14.399 align:start position:0%
and unnecessary loss of life due to the
 
03:25:17.870 --> 03:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
withholding of evidence-based treatments
 
03:25:20.330 --> 03:25:20.340 align:start position:0%
from citizens in need and I think Dr
 
03:25:23.830 --> 03:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
Nash talked a little bit about that
 
03:25:25.790 --> 03:25:25.800 align:start position:0%
the um
 
03:25:27.950 --> 03:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
this formal petition acts as both an
 
03:25:29.510 --> 03:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
official Complaint and preliminary
 
03:25:32.210 --> 03:25:32.220 align:start position:0%
exhibit to assist grand jury members in
 
03:25:34.550 --> 03:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
orienting themselves to the scope of
 
03:25:37.309 --> 03:25:37.319 align:start position:0%
alleged crimes committed and there's a
 
03:25:41.570 --> 03:25:41.580 align:start position:0%
CDC and FDA which are being accused of
 
03:25:44.150 --> 03:25:44.160 align:start position:0%
this misinformation which has led us
 
03:25:46.729 --> 03:25:46.739 align:start position:0%
which has led us to um
 
03:25:51.769 --> 03:25:51.779 align:start position:0%
the the medical malpractice that the
 
03:25:54.710 --> 03:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
um our providers and our governments
 
03:25:57.290 --> 03:25:57.300 align:start position:0%
have been leaning on okay so this that's
 
03:25:58.309 --> 03:25:58.319 align:start position:0%
the problem
 
03:26:00.469 --> 03:26:00.479 align:start position:0%
second thing is
 
03:26:02.929 --> 03:26:02.939 align:start position:0%
um you might I mean just just common
 
03:26:06.170 --> 03:26:06.180 align:start position:0%
sense you know have I I hope all of you
 
03:26:07.790 --> 03:26:07.800 align:start position:0%
have looked at the bear system and
 
03:26:10.330 --> 03:26:10.340 align:start position:0%
limited to New Hampshire and and stuff
 
03:26:13.969 --> 03:26:13.979 align:start position:0%
why and the bear system in general
 
03:26:18.710 --> 03:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
it 2000 the first two thousand people at
 
03:26:20.090 --> 03:26:20.100 align:start position:0%
least two more than two thousand people
 
03:26:22.670 --> 03:26:22.680 align:start position:0%
have died on the day of the shot more
 
03:26:24.650 --> 03:26:24.660 align:start position:0%
more than two thousand people have died
 
03:26:26.570 --> 03:26:26.580 align:start position:0%
on the second day and the thousand
 
03:26:28.309 --> 03:26:28.319 align:start position:0%
people have died on the third day not in
 
03:26:30.469 --> 03:26:30.479 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that's that's the United
 
03:26:33.110 --> 03:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
States and other it's probably half of
 
03:26:34.790 --> 03:26:34.800 align:start position:0%
that is probably United States if you
 
03:26:36.710 --> 03:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
could begin wrapping up Sir what if you
 
03:26:38.090 --> 03:26:38.100 align:start position:0%
could please start wrapping up your
 
03:26:40.729 --> 03:26:40.739 align:start position:0%
testimony okay
 
03:26:40.739 --> 03:26:41.870 align:start position:0%
testimony okay
um

03:26:41.870 --> 03:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:26:44.570 --> 03:26:44.580 align:start position:0%
here's the results for this for the
 
03:26:47.990 --> 03:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
shots as of the the first year the
 
03:26:50.269 --> 03:26:50.279 align:start position:0%
numbers the percentage of people who
 
03:26:53.570 --> 03:26:53.580 align:start position:0%
died with covid that were under age 70
 
03:26:56.349 --> 03:26:56.359 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire in New Hampshire 12
 
03:26:59.870 --> 03:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
okay first year the first year of covid
 
03:27:03.530 --> 03:27:03.540 align:start position:0%
only the um
 
03:27:05.870 --> 03:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
only the the at-risk population could
 
03:27:08.450 --> 03:27:08.460 align:start position:0%
get the shots the second year of covet
 
03:27:11.690 --> 03:27:11.700 align:start position:0%
it was given to the wider Community the
 
03:27:13.130 --> 03:27:13.140 align:start position:0%
health the healthy Community the working
 
03:27:14.510 --> 03:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
age people
 
03:27:18.950 --> 03:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
it's like second year 37 percent
 
03:27:22.790 --> 03:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
of of the uh those who died with covid
 
03:27:25.309 --> 03:27:25.319 align:start position:0%
were under age 70. okay so it went from
 
03:27:26.630 --> 03:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
12 percent
 
03:27:30.050 --> 03:27:30.060 align:start position:0%
under a 70 to 37 percent one under 870
 
03:27:36.130 --> 03:27:36.140 align:start position:0%
and one last thing on April 29th uh 2021
 
03:27:41.990 --> 03:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh Beth Daly of HHS told us that only
 
03:27:46.490 --> 03:27:46.500 align:start position:0%
one person under age 65
 
03:27:49.670 --> 03:27:49.680 align:start position:0%
who had no core morbidities only one or
 
03:27:51.830 --> 03:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
two one or maybe two she said it was at
 
03:27:54.290 --> 03:27:54.300 align:start position:0%
the gov the governor's press conference
 
03:27:57.590 --> 03:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
said it's online you can get the text
 
03:28:00.170 --> 03:28:00.180 align:start position:0%
um one or maybe two
 
03:28:00.180 --> 03:28:01.429 align:start position:0%

going to end
 
03:29:42.950 --> 03:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
I thought about that and I've been
 
03:29:44.389 --> 03:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
thinking about that since the started
 
03:29:45.889 --> 03:29:45.899 align:start position:0%
but it's going to end when they get out
 
03:29:48.229 --> 03:29:48.239 align:start position:0%

you go to that lady who lost his
 
03:29:58.190 --> 03:29:58.200 align:start position:0%
three-year-old daughter in Raymond and
 
03:29:59.870 --> 03:29:59.880 align:start position:0%
tell her your vaccine is safe and
 
03:30:02.330 --> 03:30:02.340 align:start position:0%
effective I like to go see who do that
 
03:30:04.490 --> 03:30:04.500 align:start position:0%
all right I call it I call Bull
 
03:30:06.050 --> 03:30:06.060 align:start position:0%

have you ever noticed sir can you keep
 
03:30:11.210 --> 03:30:11.220 align:start position:0%
it to the topic and not to anything yes
 
03:30:12.290 --> 03:30:12.300 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to save something I do
 
03:30:14.030 --> 03:30:14.040 align:start position:0%
support this bill it's about time that
 
03:30:16.490 --> 03:30:16.500 align:start position:0%
we you as a community make the right
 
03:30:17.990 --> 03:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
decision and protect the people of New
 
03:30:19.910 --> 03:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire not these lobbyists and
 
03:30:21.170 --> 03:30:21.180 align:start position:0%
pharmaceuticals that was pushing Us
 
03:30:23.750 --> 03:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
Poison down our bodies I like I said I
 
03:30:26.030 --> 03:30:26.040 align:start position:0%
speak here as a grandfather a parent and
 
03:30:28.610 --> 03:30:28.620 align:start position:0%
a concerned citizen okay I speak from
 
03:30:30.349 --> 03:30:30.359 align:start position:0%
the heart okay I don't have all my
 
03:30:33.110 --> 03:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
literature but I do uh belong to a lot
 
03:30:34.670 --> 03:30:34.680 align:start position:0%
of groups and I see a lot of people
 
03:30:36.650 --> 03:30:36.660 align:start position:0%
going down it's not ironic about seeing
 
03:30:39.170 --> 03:30:39.180 align:start position:0%
Peak Athletic uh athletes dying in the
 
03:30:41.929 --> 03:30:41.939 align:start position:0%
prime and it's all over the world or you
 
03:30:43.130 --> 03:30:43.140 align:start position:0%
know you're absolutely ahead of us it's
 
03:30:44.269 --> 03:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
happening here
 
03:30:46.309 --> 03:30:46.319 align:start position:0%
anybody watch football is that just like
 
03:30:46.319 --> 03:30:47.389 align:start position:0%
anybody watch football is that just like
ironic

03:30:47.389 --> 03:30:47.399 align:start position:0%
ironic
 
03:30:50.030 --> 03:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
and that guy Hamlet cannot talk about it
 
03:30:52.429 --> 03:30:52.439 align:start position:0%
why because it's safe and effective it's
 
03:30:54.349 --> 03:30:54.359 align:start position:0%
not safe in effect I lost an uncle to it
 
03:30:56.750 --> 03:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
I lost two neighbors to this poison so
 
03:30:58.070 --> 03:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
really do the right thing for New
 
03:30:59.929 --> 03:30:59.939 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens that's all I have to
 
03:31:01.429 --> 03:31:01.439 align:start position:0%
say I'm open for comments or questions
 
03:31:02.809 --> 03:31:02.819 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to be but I'm speaking
 
03:31:03.710 --> 03:31:03.720 align:start position:0%
from the heart I don't have a
 
03:31:05.450 --> 03:31:05.460 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet I'm speaking Point knowledge
 
03:31:08.590 --> 03:31:08.600 align:start position:0%

no one else has signed up to testify I'm
 
03:31:39.410 --> 03:31:39.420 align:start position:0%

03:31:41.330 --> 03:31:41.340 align:start position:0%

03:32:30.170 --> 03:32:30.180 align:start position:0%
my apologies Mr chairman in the
 
03:32:32.150 --> 03:32:32.160 align:start position:0%
committee uh thank you for hearing my
 
03:32:34.250 --> 03:32:34.260 align:start position:0%

03:32:40.490 --> 03:32:40.500 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County
 
03:32:44.990 --> 03:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:46.490 --> 03:32:46.500 align:start position:0%
so many of you in the room may be
 
03:32:48.290 --> 03:32:48.300 align:start position:0%
familiar with the language of this bill
 
03:32:50.929 --> 03:32:50.939 align:start position:0%
we saw something very similar to it
 
03:32:54.950 --> 03:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
last year in the form of House Bill 1379
 
03:32:57.530 --> 03:32:57.540 align:start position:0%
and this is
 
03:32:57.540 --> 03:32:58.250 align:start position:0%
and this is
um

03:32:58.250 --> 03:32:58.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:33:01.130 --> 03:33:01.140 align:start position:0%
essentially about whether or not
 
03:33:03.229 --> 03:33:03.239 align:start position:0%
the mandating of immunizations for
 
03:33:05.570 --> 03:33:05.580 align:start position:0%
children in our state should be a matter
 
03:33:08.630 --> 03:33:08.640 align:start position:0%
for the legislature to decide or whether
 
03:33:10.849 --> 03:33:10.859 align:start position:0%
the legislature ought to delegate that
 
03:33:10.859 --> 03:33:12.130 align:start position:0%
the legislature ought to delegate that
power

03:33:12.130 --> 03:33:12.140 align:start position:0%
power
 
03:33:17.750 --> 03:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
to to unelected people in the agencies
 
03:33:17.760 --> 03:33:18.469 align:start position:0%
to to unelected people in the agencies
um

03:33:18.469 --> 03:33:18.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:33:18.479 --> 03:33:20.389 align:start position:0%
um
essentially

03:33:20.389 --> 03:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
03:33:22.309 --> 03:33:22.319 align:start position:0%
I guess I'll I'll start by kind of
 
03:33:24.229 --> 03:33:24.239 align:start position:0%
breaking down where we are and how we
 
03:33:27.769 --> 03:33:27.779 align:start position:0%
got here so RSA 141c
 
03:33:29.750 --> 03:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
um 20a stipulates that certain
 
03:33:32.450 --> 03:33:32.460 align:start position:0%
immunizations are required for children
 
03:33:35.090 --> 03:33:35.100 align:start position:0%
living in the state of New Hampshire
 
03:33:38.269 --> 03:33:38.279 align:start position:0%
um practically speaking this is enforced
 
03:33:40.910 --> 03:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
at the uh at the child care and school
 
03:33:44.330 --> 03:33:44.340 align:start position:0%
level nevertheless it is a requirement
 
03:33:47.450 --> 03:33:47.460 align:start position:0%
whether a child is in child care or or
 
03:33:49.429 --> 03:33:49.439 align:start position:0%
school or not
 
03:33:51.830 --> 03:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
there are also certain exemptions such
 
03:33:53.690 --> 03:33:53.700 align:start position:0%
as a medical exemption or a religious
 
03:33:55.490 --> 03:33:55.500 align:start position:0%
exemption that families can Avail
 
03:33:56.990 --> 03:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
themselves of
 
03:33:57.000 --> 03:33:58.429 align:start position:0%
themselves of
but

03:33:58.429 --> 03:33:58.439 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:34:00.410 --> 03:34:00.420 align:start position:0%
the the immunizations there are a number
 
03:34:02.870 --> 03:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
of immunizations mentioned specifically
 
03:34:04.550 --> 03:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
in statute which means that the
 
03:34:08.150 --> 03:34:08.160 align:start position:0%
legislature at some point heard
 
03:34:10.370 --> 03:34:10.380 align:start position:0%
testimony in hearings like this came to
 
03:34:11.990 --> 03:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
a decision and decided that those should
 
03:34:14.330 --> 03:34:14.340 align:start position:0%
be required immunizations
 
03:34:16.790 --> 03:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
those include diphtheria mumps pertussis
 
03:34:20.570 --> 03:34:20.580 align:start position:0%
polio rebello rubiola and tetanus
 
03:34:24.769 --> 03:34:24.779 align:start position:0%
um the same RSA also specifies that the
 
03:34:25.910 --> 03:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of Health and Human
 
03:34:28.550 --> 03:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
Services has the power to adopt rules
 
03:34:30.710 --> 03:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
with respect to other diseases requiring
 
03:34:30.720 --> 03:34:32.030 align:start position:0%
with respect to other diseases requiring
immunization

03:34:32.030 --> 03:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
immunization
 
03:34:34.070 --> 03:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
this has led to three additional
 
03:34:36.410 --> 03:34:36.420 align:start position:0%
immunization requirements being
 
03:34:38.510 --> 03:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
established within administrative rule
 
03:34:42.190 --> 03:34:42.200 align:start position:0%
these include varicella or chickenpox
 
03:34:46.429 --> 03:34:46.439 align:start position:0%
hemophilus influenza type B and
 
03:34:49.309 --> 03:34:49.319 align:start position:0%
hepatitis B
 
03:34:52.190 --> 03:34:52.200 align:start position:0%
this bill is not intended to argue for
 
03:34:56.229 --> 03:34:56.239 align:start position:0%
or against any of those immunizations
 
03:34:58.969 --> 03:34:58.979 align:start position:0%
the you know personally I believe that
 
03:35:00.710 --> 03:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
that should be a decision that rests
 
03:35:03.170 --> 03:35:03.180 align:start position:0%
with each family
 
03:35:04.969 --> 03:35:04.979 align:start position:0%
um the concern that I have that I've
 
03:35:06.670 --> 03:35:06.680 align:start position:0%
raised before and will continue to raise
 
03:35:08.570 --> 03:35:08.580 align:start position:0%
is that
 
03:35:11.090 --> 03:35:11.100 align:start position:0%
the decision to mandate a medical
 
03:35:13.070 --> 03:35:13.080 align:start position:0%
procedure of any kind
 
03:35:16.729 --> 03:35:16.739 align:start position:0%
is a very grave decision
 
03:35:18.170 --> 03:35:18.180 align:start position:0%
I believe that the people of New
 
03:35:19.910 --> 03:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire deserve to have that decision
 
03:35:25.190 --> 03:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:28.010 --> 03:35:28.020 align:start position:0%
there is uh
 
03:35:29.809 --> 03:35:29.819 align:start position:0%
you know there there is a rulemaking
 
03:35:32.090 --> 03:35:32.100 align:start position:0%
process and there are there's a
 
03:35:33.590 --> 03:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
potential for hearings in the rulemaking
 
03:35:35.450 --> 03:35:35.460 align:start position:0%
process but let's be very clear about
 
03:35:37.849 --> 03:35:37.859 align:start position:0%
the what the rulemaking process is and
 
03:35:39.130 --> 03:35:39.140 align:start position:0%
is not
 
03:35:42.410 --> 03:35:42.420 align:start position:0%
specifically the rulemaking process does
 
03:35:47.990 --> 03:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:51.469 --> 03:35:51.479 align:start position:0%
but it uh you know It ultimately places
 
03:35:54.110 --> 03:35:54.120 align:start position:0%
the decision in the hands of arguably a
 
03:35:56.150 --> 03:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
single person there is a
 
03:35:57.710 --> 03:35:57.720 align:start position:0%
a committee The Joint legislative
 
03:35:59.290 --> 03:35:59.300 align:start position:0%
committee on administrative rules
 
03:36:02.210 --> 03:36:02.220 align:start position:0%
consisting of legislators from both the
 
03:36:04.670 --> 03:36:04.680 align:start position:0%
House and Senate who have an opportunity
 
03:36:07.010 --> 03:36:07.020 align:start position:0%
to raise objections those objections
 
03:36:09.170 --> 03:36:09.180 align:start position:0%
must be made on statutory terms in other
 
03:36:09.180 --> 03:36:10.130 align:start position:0%
must be made on statutory terms in other
words

03:36:10.130 --> 03:36:10.140 align:start position:0%
words
 
03:36:14.150 --> 03:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
a majority of the committee must vote
 
03:36:18.590 --> 03:36:18.600 align:start position:0%
that a rule is not authorized in statute
 
03:36:21.250 --> 03:36:21.260 align:start position:0%
in order to block it from taking effect
 
03:36:24.469 --> 03:36:24.479 align:start position:0%
so it's uh it's sort of the the deck is
 
03:36:25.910 --> 03:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
stack that administrative rules do
 
03:36:25.920 --> 03:36:27.110 align:start position:0%
stack that administrative rules do
become

03:36:27.110 --> 03:36:27.120 align:start position:0%
become
 
03:36:29.990 --> 03:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
have do do become law have the effect of
 
03:36:32.690 --> 03:36:32.700 align:start position:0%
law unless members of that committee a
 
03:36:33.889 --> 03:36:33.899 align:start position:0%
majority of members of that committee
 
03:36:35.929 --> 03:36:35.939 align:start position:0%
find a reason
 
03:36:38.750 --> 03:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
um that it it would violate statutes to
 
03:36:42.710 --> 03:36:42.720 align:start position:0%
to allow it to go into effect so
 
03:36:44.450 --> 03:36:44.460 align:start position:0%
um what we have heard multiple times
 
03:36:46.070 --> 03:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Health and Human
 
03:36:47.929 --> 03:36:47.939 align:start position:0%
Services is that the department does not
 
03:36:50.809 --> 03:36:50.819 align:start position:0%
intend to implement required for
 
03:36:53.269 --> 03:36:53.279 align:start position:0%
requirements for a covid-19 vaccination
 
03:36:56.929 --> 03:36:56.939 align:start position:0%
at this time it is always qualified with
 
03:36:59.870 --> 03:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
the phrase at this time and although
 
03:37:02.389 --> 03:37:02.399 align:start position:0%
this is not this this bill is certainly
 
03:37:05.510 --> 03:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
not specific to covid-19 I think it's a
 
03:37:07.190 --> 03:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
concern for a great many people as we've
 
03:37:09.410 --> 03:37:09.420 align:start position:0%
heard and um
 
03:37:12.830 --> 03:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
I think that there are as we as we see
 
03:37:17.650 --> 03:37:17.660 align:start position:0%
the CDC and asip uh move forward with
 
03:37:19.790 --> 03:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
placing the
 
03:37:23.150 --> 03:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
um the covid-19 vaccine on the list of
 
03:37:26.150 --> 03:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
recommended vaccinations I think that
 
03:37:29.929 --> 03:37:29.939 align:start position:0%
the concern of that possibility is
 
03:37:32.150 --> 03:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
increasing and
 
03:37:35.410 --> 03:37:35.420 align:start position:0%
it's interesting that a CDC director Dr
 
03:37:37.729 --> 03:37:37.739 align:start position:0%
Rochelle wolinsky
 
03:37:37.739 --> 03:37:38.630 align:start position:0%
Rochelle wolinsky
um

03:37:38.630 --> 03:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:41.809 --> 03:37:41.819 align:start position:0%
testified a couple of weeks ago
 
03:37:44.769 --> 03:37:44.779 align:start position:0%
before Congress and was asked why
 
03:37:48.170 --> 03:37:48.180 align:start position:0%
why did they make the decision to put an
 
03:37:50.929 --> 03:37:50.939 align:start position:0%
emergency use authorization vaccine
 
03:37:53.570 --> 03:37:53.580 align:start position:0%
on the the immunization schedule for a
 
03:37:55.250 --> 03:37:55.260 align:start position:0%
disease that poses very little risk to
 
03:37:58.309 --> 03:37:58.319 align:start position:0%
children and for which uh the vaccine
 
03:38:00.250 --> 03:38:00.260 align:start position:0%
poses many potential side effects
 
03:38:02.769 --> 03:38:02.779 align:start position:0%
without actually preventing transmission
 
03:38:06.110 --> 03:38:06.120 align:start position:0%
and her answer is very telling
 
03:38:06.120 --> 03:38:07.250 align:start position:0%
and her answer is very telling
quote

03:38:07.250 --> 03:38:07.260 align:start position:0%
quote
 
03:38:09.410 --> 03:38:09.420 align:start position:0%
the reason that the asip recommended the
 
03:38:13.070 --> 03:38:13.080 align:start position:0%
CDs the CDC put the covid-19 vaccine on
 
03:38:15.530 --> 03:38:15.540 align:start position:0%
the Pediatric schedule was only because
 
03:38:17.929 --> 03:38:17.939 align:start position:0%
it was the only way it could be covered
 
03:38:22.010 --> 03:38:22.020 align:start position:0%
in our vaccines for children program
 
03:38:23.570 --> 03:38:23.580 align:start position:0%
it was the only way that our
 
03:38:25.309 --> 03:38:25.319 align:start position:0%
underinsured children would be able to
 
03:38:27.950 --> 03:38:27.960 align:start position:0%
have access to the vaccines that was the
 
03:38:29.769 --> 03:38:29.779 align:start position:0%
reason they put it there in other words
 
03:38:33.349 --> 03:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
the CDC is now recommending vaccines not
 
03:38:35.570 --> 03:38:35.580 align:start position:0%
because they're recommended not because
 
03:38:37.010 --> 03:38:37.020 align:start position:0%
they're effective not because they're
 
03:38:39.950 --> 03:38:39.960 align:start position:0%
helpful but because
 
03:38:42.469 --> 03:38:42.479 align:start position:0%
they can provide them for free
 
03:38:45.370 --> 03:38:45.380 align:start position:0%
I find that to be a sort of disturbing
 
03:38:49.190 --> 03:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
development in in this process and I
 
03:38:51.889 --> 03:38:51.899 align:start position:0%
think it raises concerns with respect to
 
03:38:53.809 --> 03:38:53.819 align:start position:0%
what could potentially happen in New
 
03:38:55.610 --> 03:38:55.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire one of the questions that came
 
03:38:57.530 --> 03:38:57.540 align:start position:0%
up the last time I presented this bill
 
03:38:57.540 --> 03:38:59.450 align:start position:0%
up the last time I presented this bill
was

03:38:59.450 --> 03:38:59.460 align:start position:0%
was
 
03:39:02.030 --> 03:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
um you know don't you think our current
 
03:39:03.710 --> 03:39:03.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner has done a good job and the
 
03:39:06.170 --> 03:39:06.180 align:start position:0%
answer was yes and I can my answer
 
03:39:09.469 --> 03:39:09.479 align:start position:0%
continues to be yes with respect to the
 
03:39:11.269 --> 03:39:11.279 align:start position:0%
acting commissioner as well I am very
 
03:39:13.849 --> 03:39:13.859 align:start position:0%
pleased that they have actually
 
03:39:16.150 --> 03:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
exercised a good deal of restraint
 
03:39:19.370 --> 03:39:19.380 align:start position:0%
in not adding a lot of those asip
 
03:39:21.349 --> 03:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
recommended vaccines
 
03:39:23.870 --> 03:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
to the requirements in New Hampshire in
 
03:39:25.969 --> 03:39:25.979 align:start position:0%
other words they've only chosen to
 
03:39:29.150 --> 03:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
require a fairly small subset
 
03:39:31.309 --> 03:39:31.319 align:start position:0%
having said that
 
03:39:33.349 --> 03:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
I believe this legislation is necessary
 
03:39:35.809 --> 03:39:35.819 align:start position:0%
because I think that these kinds of
 
03:39:38.450 --> 03:39:38.460 align:start position:0%
decisions as I said before
 
03:39:41.750 --> 03:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
are extraordinarily serious and that the
 
03:39:43.070 --> 03:39:43.080 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire deserve to have
 
03:39:46.370 --> 03:39:46.380 align:start position:0%
them made by elected representatives
 
03:39:46.380 --> 03:39:47.990 align:start position:0%
them made by elected representatives
so

03:39:47.990 --> 03:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:39:48.000 --> 03:39:49.849 align:start position:0%
so
um

03:39:49.849 --> 03:39:49.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:52.130 --> 03:39:52.140 align:start position:0%
you know we don't know what a future
 
03:39:53.210 --> 03:39:53.220 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of Health and Human
 
03:39:56.710 --> 03:39:56.720 align:start position:0%
Services might decide to do
 
03:39:56.720 --> 03:39:58.370 align:start position:0%
Services might decide to do
so

03:39:58.370 --> 03:39:58.380 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:40:00.410 --> 03:40:00.420 align:start position:0%
the bill does
 
03:40:00.420 --> 03:40:02.389 align:start position:0%
the bill does
um

03:40:02.389 --> 03:40:02.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:04.130 --> 03:40:04.140 align:start position:0%
the bill does contain a provision that
 
03:40:06.309 --> 03:40:06.319 align:start position:0%
last year's Bill did not
 
03:40:09.530 --> 03:40:09.540 align:start position:0%
namely there's a concern that the
 
03:40:12.290 --> 03:40:12.300 align:start position:0%
the immunizations that are named in rule
 
03:40:14.469 --> 03:40:14.479 align:start position:0%
but not in statute
 
03:40:17.030 --> 03:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
based on last year's bill would have
 
03:40:19.010 --> 03:40:19.020 align:start position:0%
just disappeared as soon as that bill
 
03:40:21.410 --> 03:40:21.420 align:start position:0%
went into effect and that would leave us
 
03:40:24.710 --> 03:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
suddenly without a mandate for varicella
 
03:40:27.410 --> 03:40:27.420 align:start position:0%
Hepatitis B or hemophilus influenza type
 
03:40:27.420 --> 03:40:29.030 align:start position:0%
Hepatitis B or hemophilus influenza type
B

03:40:29.030 --> 03:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
B
 
03:40:32.269 --> 03:40:32.279 align:start position:0%
um this bill addresses that concern by
 
03:40:35.150 --> 03:40:35.160 align:start position:0%
asserting that those rules would remain
 
03:40:38.030 --> 03:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
in effect until their expiration date of
 
03:40:41.330 --> 03:40:41.340 align:start position:0%
June 30th 2026 that would give the
 
03:40:43.610 --> 03:40:43.620 align:start position:0%
legislature ample time
 
03:40:48.070 --> 03:40:48.080 align:start position:0%
to bring forward legislation and and
 
03:40:51.229 --> 03:40:51.239 align:start position:0%
submit those to a full public hearing
 
03:40:53.269 --> 03:40:53.279 align:start position:0%
such as the one we're we're sitting
 
03:40:54.610 --> 03:40:54.620 align:start position:0%
through today
 
03:40:57.830 --> 03:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
so that ends my testimony and with that
 
03:40:59.210 --> 03:40:59.220 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I will take any questions
 
03:41:03.590 --> 03:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Shapiro
 
03:41:05.450 --> 03:41:05.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thanks for
 
03:41:06.650 --> 03:41:06.660 align:start position:0%
taking this question
 
03:41:06.660 --> 03:41:09.349 align:start position:0%
taking this question
um

03:41:09.349 --> 03:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:11.690 --> 03:41:11.700 align:start position:0%
I hear you and I agree with you about
 
03:41:15.950 --> 03:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
what um an important decision it is to
 
03:41:17.870 --> 03:41:17.880 align:start position:0%
either add a vaccine which it will then
 
03:41:20.450 --> 03:41:20.460 align:start position:0%
be required or or not
 
03:41:20.460 --> 03:41:21.170 align:start position:0%
be required or or not
um

03:41:21.170 --> 03:41:21.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:23.870 --> 03:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
and like many of the bills that maybe
 
03:41:26.150 --> 03:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
all the bills that we hear there are
 
03:41:27.349 --> 03:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
03:41:27.359 --> 03:41:28.790 align:start position:0%
going to be
um

03:41:28.790 --> 03:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:31.370 --> 03:41:31.380 align:start position:0%
they're going to be positive things that
 
03:41:33.769 --> 03:41:33.779 align:start position:0%
come out of it if we pass it
 
03:41:33.779 --> 03:41:34.969 align:start position:0%
come out of it if we pass it
um

03:41:34.969 --> 03:41:34.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:37.309 --> 03:41:37.319 align:start position:0%
and there might be positive things that
 
03:41:38.570 --> 03:41:38.580 align:start position:0%
come out of it if we don't pass we're
 
03:41:40.610 --> 03:41:40.620 align:start position:0%
always you know we're always making a
 
03:41:42.590 --> 03:41:42.600 align:start position:0%
measured decision about which is the
 
03:41:45.229 --> 03:41:45.239 align:start position:0%
most positive direction to go in so my
 
03:41:48.769 --> 03:41:48.779 align:start position:0%
question to you is if we were to pass
 
03:41:50.870 --> 03:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
this legislation
 
03:41:53.809 --> 03:41:53.819 align:start position:0%
and future decisions about vaccines were
 
03:41:56.870 --> 03:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
fully in the hands of the legislature do
 
03:42:00.530 --> 03:42:00.540 align:start position:0%
you have any ideas about how we could
 
03:42:05.150 --> 03:42:05.160 align:start position:0%
avoid the incredible partisan
 
03:42:05.160 --> 03:42:09.710 align:start position:0%
avoid the incredible partisan
um

03:42:09.710 --> 03:42:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:12.050 --> 03:42:12.060 align:start position:0%
um turmoil
 
03:42:12.060 --> 03:42:13.070 align:start position:0%
um turmoil
um

03:42:13.070 --> 03:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:15.410 --> 03:42:15.420 align:start position:0%
within which environment will have to
 
03:42:18.290 --> 03:42:18.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:20.090 --> 03:42:20.100 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
03:42:20.100 --> 03:42:22.610 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
um

03:42:22.610 --> 03:42:22.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:24.650 --> 03:42:24.660 align:start position:0%
people have strong feelings about this
 
03:42:27.349 --> 03:42:27.359 align:start position:0%
there is no doubt
 
03:42:27.359 --> 03:42:29.510 align:start position:0%
there is no doubt
um

03:42:29.510 --> 03:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:33.290 --> 03:42:33.300 align:start position:0%
I generally default to the the wisdom of
 
03:42:35.750 --> 03:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
parents in making these kinds of
 
03:42:38.630 --> 03:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
decisions for their children I would I
 
03:42:40.370 --> 03:42:40.380 align:start position:0%
guess one of the things I would point
 
03:42:42.170 --> 03:42:42.180 align:start position:0%
out is that if you look at voluntary
 
03:42:43.670 --> 03:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
vaccination rates and we've actually
 
03:42:46.550 --> 03:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
we've we've asked this question of
 
03:42:47.929 --> 03:42:47.939 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services although I
 
03:42:50.030 --> 03:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
think we didn't ask it very specifically
 
03:42:52.550 --> 03:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
so if they were you know they had some
 
03:42:56.090 --> 03:42:56.100 align:start position:0%
general numbers and the voluntary
 
03:42:58.250 --> 03:42:58.260 align:start position:0%
vaccination rates in the state of New
 
03:42:58.260 --> 03:42:59.050 align:start position:0%
vaccination rates in the state of New
Hampshire

03:42:59.050 --> 03:42:59.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:43:01.910 --> 03:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
if memory serves me correctly and
 
03:43:04.550 --> 03:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
perhaps they can clarify this is
 
03:43:08.269 --> 03:43:08.279 align:start position:0%
somewhere between 70 and 90 early low
 
03:43:12.110 --> 03:43:12.120 align:start position:0%
90s percent on various types of vaccines
 
03:43:14.570 --> 03:43:14.580 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire so the the
 
03:43:16.429 --> 03:43:16.439 align:start position:0%
reality is that voluntary vaccination
 
03:43:19.790 --> 03:43:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:23.929 --> 03:43:23.939 align:start position:0%
and you know I I guess I'm I'm kind of a
 
03:43:26.809 --> 03:43:26.819 align:start position:0%
Live and Let Live kind of a guy and this
 
03:43:29.510 --> 03:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
to me is the sort of legislation that
 
03:43:31.790 --> 03:43:31.800 align:start position:0%
that asserts that we all ought to be
 
03:43:34.130 --> 03:43:34.140 align:start position:0%
able to make these decisions and and get
 
03:43:37.670 --> 03:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
along reasonably uh on that basis
 
03:43:40.370 --> 03:43:40.380 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
03:43:43.490 --> 03:43:43.500 align:start position:0%
I think I'm also a live-in Let Live guy
 
03:43:46.309 --> 03:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
and I think um
 
03:43:47.870 --> 03:43:47.880 align:start position:0%
you know while we might be on different
 
03:43:50.330 --> 03:43:50.340 align:start position:0%
sides of issues I also think parents
 
03:43:52.490 --> 03:43:52.500 align:start position:0%
should be fully involved in making
 
03:43:55.309 --> 03:43:55.319 align:start position:0%
decisions for their children my question
 
03:43:58.070 --> 03:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
really is more if we're looking forward
 
03:44:00.229 --> 03:44:00.239 align:start position:0%
to the legislature making decisions
 
03:44:04.190 --> 03:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
about these kinds of issues not families
 
03:44:04.200 --> 03:44:05.809 align:start position:0%
about these kinds of issues not families
um

03:44:05.809 --> 03:44:05.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:09.889 --> 03:44:09.899 align:start position:0%
how can we avoid the kind of intense
 
03:44:13.670 --> 03:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
partisan conflict and that that we're
 
03:44:15.530 --> 03:44:15.540 align:start position:0%
seeing in the room today to be perfectly
 
03:44:18.170 --> 03:44:18.180 align:start position:0%
honest with you and how is that a good
 
03:44:20.990 --> 03:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
environment to make these decisions
 
03:44:22.849 --> 03:44:22.859 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I guess I I
 
03:44:24.410 --> 03:44:24.420 align:start position:0%
would just respond that I think a good
 
03:44:27.410 --> 03:44:27.420 align:start position:0%
healthy debate is is good
 
03:44:30.349 --> 03:44:30.359 align:start position:0%
um it
 
03:44:32.090 --> 03:44:32.100 align:start position:0%
I think it bothers me as much as anybody
 
03:44:35.150 --> 03:44:35.160 align:start position:0%
when I see that an unhealthy debate
 
03:44:36.530 --> 03:44:36.540 align:start position:0%
um and so I think it's just incumbent
 
03:44:38.450 --> 03:44:38.460 align:start position:0%
upon all of us to try to maintain that
 
03:44:43.130 --> 03:44:43.140 align:start position:0%
kind of a tone yes it will get
 
03:44:44.630 --> 03:44:44.640 align:start position:0%
um you know it can get heated at times
 
03:44:45.950 --> 03:44:45.960 align:start position:0%
because people have strong feelings
 
03:44:47.929 --> 03:44:47.939 align:start position:0%
about it but I I think we can we can do
 
03:44:50.090 --> 03:44:50.100 align:start position:0%
well and it deserves a public hearing
 
03:44:52.429 --> 03:44:52.439 align:start position:0%
another discussion yes representative
 
03:44:52.439 --> 03:44:54.410 align:start position:0%
another discussion yes representative
McLean

03:44:54.410 --> 03:44:54.420 align:start position:0%
McLean
 
03:44:55.610 --> 03:44:55.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
03:44:56.929 --> 03:44:56.939 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:44:56.939 --> 03:44:57.769 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

03:44:57.769 --> 03:44:57.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:59.870 --> 03:44:59.880 align:start position:0%
um maybe you could kind of inform the
 
03:45:01.729 --> 03:45:01.739 align:start position:0%
committee a little bit about some of the
 
03:45:04.670 --> 03:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
history as to what because it used to be
 
03:45:07.190 --> 03:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
just statute and then it evolved to to
 
03:45:09.650 --> 03:45:09.660 align:start position:0%
Grant this rule-making Authority were
 
03:45:13.910 --> 03:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
there any concerns or issues that drove
 
03:45:15.769 --> 03:45:15.779 align:start position:0%
the decision to kind of move in that
 
03:45:17.630 --> 03:45:17.640 align:start position:0%
direction that you're aware of
 
03:45:20.150 --> 03:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so I
 
03:45:24.050 --> 03:45:24.060 align:start position:0%
um I I would probably defer to the folks
 
03:45:27.050 --> 03:45:27.060 align:start position:0%
from from DHHS here who who can State
 
03:45:28.849 --> 03:45:28.859 align:start position:0%
their concerns I know that one concern
 
03:45:30.530 --> 03:45:30.540 align:start position:0%
that has come up in these discussions
 
03:45:33.950 --> 03:45:33.960 align:start position:0%
fairly frequently is what if there's an
 
03:45:35.030 --> 03:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
emergency if there's a public health
 
03:45:38.330 --> 03:45:38.340 align:start position:0%
emergency and we have to act fast
 
03:45:41.389 --> 03:45:41.399 align:start position:0%
um I would say I have a couple of
 
03:45:45.469 --> 03:45:45.479 align:start position:0%
responses to that first of all that the
 
03:45:49.550 --> 03:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
um the voluntary rate of vaccination is
 
03:45:53.330 --> 03:45:53.340 align:start position:0%
very high even for the covid-19 vaccine
 
03:45:55.790 --> 03:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
which many people were you know were
 
03:45:58.429 --> 03:45:58.439 align:start position:0%
questioning had a very very high rate of
 
03:46:00.110 --> 03:46:00.120 align:start position:0%
voluntary vaccination in the state of
 
03:46:01.969 --> 03:46:01.979 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
03:46:04.070 --> 03:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
um the the other thing I would point out
 
03:46:06.830 --> 03:46:06.840 align:start position:0%
is that under the emergency statute the
 
03:46:09.170 --> 03:46:09.180 align:start position:0%
governor has pretty broad Powers
 
03:46:10.790 --> 03:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
um and
 
03:46:14.630 --> 03:46:14.640 align:start position:0%
can can can issue mandates if there is a
 
03:46:18.170 --> 03:46:18.180 align:start position:0%
grave Public Health concern there so
 
03:46:20.809 --> 03:46:20.819 align:start position:0%
um I think that there are there are ways
 
03:46:23.630 --> 03:46:23.640 align:start position:0%
to handle those those concerns uh
 
03:46:25.969 --> 03:46:25.979 align:start position:0%
without necessarily granting the sort of
 
03:46:28.790 --> 03:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
blanket uh Power for mandating new
 
03:46:28.800 --> 03:46:30.469 align:start position:0%
blanket uh Power for mandating new
immunizations

03:46:30.469 --> 03:46:30.479 align:start position:0%
immunizations
 
03:46:32.870 --> 03:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
03:46:35.030 --> 03:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
and rep representative Missouri yep
 
03:46:36.349 --> 03:46:36.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
03:46:37.670 --> 03:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
my question
 
03:46:40.729 --> 03:46:40.739 align:start position:0%
um so I hear that so
 
03:46:44.090 --> 03:46:44.100 align:start position:0%
that this bill removes the rule-making
 
03:46:46.670 --> 03:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
authority from DHHS and then I heard
 
03:46:48.349 --> 03:46:48.359 align:start position:0%
someone else say that it hands it over
 
03:46:51.110 --> 03:46:51.120 align:start position:0%
to the legislature but I don't see that
 
03:46:53.809 --> 03:46:53.819 align:start position:0%
authority of legislature on here did I
 
03:46:55.130 --> 03:46:55.140 align:start position:0%
miss something
 
03:46:57.830 --> 03:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
just just by virtue that the power the
 
03:47:00.469 --> 03:47:00.479 align:start position:0%
legislature is is endowed by the
 
03:47:02.090 --> 03:47:02.100 align:start position:0%
Constitution with the power to make laws
 
03:47:02.100 --> 03:47:03.650 align:start position:0%
Constitution with the power to make laws
so

03:47:03.650 --> 03:47:03.660 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:47:03.660 --> 03:47:04.610 align:start position:0%
so
um

03:47:04.610 --> 03:47:04.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:07.490 --> 03:47:07.500 align:start position:0%
it it's the what is already in statute
 
03:47:09.889 --> 03:47:09.899 align:start position:0%
so if you look at the bill
 
03:47:12.950 --> 03:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
um line four
 
03:47:15.050 --> 03:47:15.060 align:start position:0%
um that's what
 
03:47:17.030 --> 03:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
the legislature has already deemed
 
03:47:19.190 --> 03:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
should be a required immunization under
 
03:47:24.170 --> 03:47:24.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:26.750 --> 03:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:28.309 --> 03:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
a little bit
 
03:47:30.290 --> 03:47:30.300 align:start position:0%
so yeah so I guess my concern with that
 
03:47:31.849 --> 03:47:31.859 align:start position:0%
a little bit is
 
03:47:34.010 --> 03:47:34.020 align:start position:0%
what representative Shapiro alluded to
 
03:47:34.020 --> 03:47:36.050 align:start position:0%
what representative Shapiro alluded to
is

03:47:36.050 --> 03:47:36.060 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:47:36.060 --> 03:47:36.769 align:start position:0%
is
um

03:47:36.769 --> 03:47:36.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:40.070 --> 03:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
so majority versus minority in the
 
03:47:43.670 --> 03:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
legislature and how a decision
 
03:47:46.250 --> 03:47:46.260 align:start position:0%
this could be a like a big
 
03:47:48.889 --> 03:47:48.899 align:start position:0%
if something like covid comes up again
 
03:47:48.899 --> 03:47:49.910 align:start position:0%
if something like covid comes up again
and

03:47:49.910 --> 03:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:47:53.330 --> 03:47:53.340 align:start position:0%
in a future uh where the majority
 
03:47:55.010 --> 03:47:55.020 align:start position:0%
mandates something that is against the
 
03:47:56.750 --> 03:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
will of the people
 
03:47:56.760 --> 03:47:58.130 align:start position:0%
will of the people
uh

03:47:58.130 --> 03:47:58.140 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:48:01.190 --> 03:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
that concerns me a little bit but so so
 
03:48:03.650 --> 03:48:03.660 align:start position:0%
last year there was a bill before this
 
03:48:05.330 --> 03:48:05.340 align:start position:0%
committee which would have mandated the
 
03:48:07.790 --> 03:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccine for
 
03:48:09.950 --> 03:48:09.960 align:start position:0%
the bill called them children but it was
 
03:48:12.070 --> 03:48:12.080 align:start position:0%
children up to age 26
 
03:48:14.210 --> 03:48:14.220 align:start position:0%
including anyone enrolled in an
 
03:48:16.070 --> 03:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
Institute of higher education which
 
03:48:19.010 --> 03:48:19.020 align:start position:0%
might include children up to age 99 for
 
03:48:20.990 --> 03:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
for all we know I would have to go back
 
03:48:22.969 --> 03:48:22.979 align:start position:0%
and read that bill to get it exactly but
 
03:48:26.210 --> 03:48:26.220 align:start position:0%
those kinds of bills do come before us
 
03:48:29.510 --> 03:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
um that one I think was was retained or
 
03:48:33.110 --> 03:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
it yelled fairly quickly we I think are
 
03:48:34.670 --> 03:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
going to be hearing a bill later that
 
03:48:36.170 --> 03:48:36.180 align:start position:0%
would repeal the medical freedom in
 
03:48:39.290 --> 03:48:39.300 align:start position:0%
immunizations act so
 
03:48:43.490 --> 03:48:43.500 align:start position:0%
um also part of 141 a or C actually at
 
03:48:47.570 --> 03:48:47.580 align:start position:0%
141c I believe so it it's it is within
 
03:48:50.210 --> 03:48:50.220 align:start position:0%
our power as a legislature to to decide
 
03:48:52.910 --> 03:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
these things unless somebody wants to
 
03:48:55.670 --> 03:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
um sort of assert in the Constitution
 
03:48:57.889 --> 03:48:57.899 align:start position:0%
that we don't yeah
 
03:49:00.950 --> 03:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:03.229 --> 03:49:03.239 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman
 
03:49:05.510 --> 03:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
03:49:07.010 --> 03:49:07.020 align:start position:0%
um so I'm
 
03:49:09.349 --> 03:49:09.359 align:start position:0%
to follow up on uh representative
 
03:49:12.710 --> 03:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
mazur's uh question
 
03:49:15.590 --> 03:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
there is more public input
 
03:49:19.370 --> 03:49:19.380 align:start position:0%
when the legislature is required to take
 
03:49:23.330 --> 03:49:23.340 align:start position:0%
up a bill as opposed to when the
 
03:49:25.429 --> 03:49:25.439 align:start position:0%
department proposes an administrative
 
03:49:28.670 --> 03:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
rule is that correct yes it is
 
03:49:30.710 --> 03:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
absolutely and and that's part of my
 
03:49:32.210 --> 03:49:32.220 align:start position:0%
concern and part of the reason I I
 
03:49:34.190 --> 03:49:34.200 align:start position:0%
raised this bill is you know
 
03:49:35.630 --> 03:49:35.640 align:start position:0%
fundamentally that these things should
 
03:49:37.070 --> 03:49:37.080 align:start position:0%
be decided by The People's elected
 
03:49:39.349 --> 03:49:39.359 align:start position:0%
representatives but
 
03:49:41.510 --> 03:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
um that the the hearing process the
 
03:49:44.150 --> 03:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
public input process is is considerably
 
03:49:47.269 --> 03:49:47.279 align:start position:0%
greater in the legislative process than
 
03:49:49.790 --> 03:49:49.800 align:start position:0%
it is in the rulemaking process
 
03:49:52.010 --> 03:49:52.020 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you Mr
 
03:49:53.750 --> 03:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you representative I
 
03:49:54.950 --> 03:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
have a question related to the
 
03:49:57.050 --> 03:49:57.060 align:start position:0%
rulemaking process and what Authority
 
03:49:58.790 --> 03:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
jailcar has
 
03:50:01.010 --> 03:50:01.020 align:start position:0%
um it's it's my understanding that gel
 
03:50:03.710 --> 03:50:03.720 align:start position:0%
Carr can only reject a bill if it's
 
03:50:06.530 --> 03:50:06.540 align:start position:0%
contrary to current statutes so with the
 
03:50:08.389 --> 03:50:08.399 align:start position:0%
current statute of medical freedom and
 
03:50:10.190 --> 03:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
immunizations they would not be able to
 
03:50:13.010 --> 03:50:13.020 align:start position:0%
to add the covid-19 vaccination through
 
03:50:15.290 --> 03:50:15.300 align:start position:0%
rulemaking however if that was removed
 
03:50:18.110 --> 03:50:18.120 align:start position:0%
it would be fair game is that correct
 
03:50:19.670 --> 03:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
can you repeat the last part of your
 
03:50:22.370 --> 03:50:22.380 align:start position:0%
question again I'm sorry that rules can
 
03:50:24.050 --> 03:50:24.060 align:start position:0%
only be rejected if they're contrary to
 
03:50:26.570 --> 03:50:26.580 align:start position:0%
the statutes and there's currently a
 
03:50:28.490 --> 03:50:28.500 align:start position:0%
statute that prohibits mandating the
 
03:50:30.710 --> 03:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccine for any public benefit
 
03:50:32.870 --> 03:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
which would include school
 
03:50:32.880 --> 03:50:34.969 align:start position:0%
which would include school
um

03:50:34.969 --> 03:50:34.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:38.750 --> 03:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
there there is a
 
03:50:42.370 --> 03:50:42.380 align:start position:0%
so so the current so 141's
 
03:50:46.670 --> 03:50:46.680 align:start position:0%
141c actually stipulates that this is a
 
03:50:48.229 --> 03:50:48.239 align:start position:0%
requirement for every child in New
 
03:50:48.239 --> 03:50:50.450 align:start position:0%
requirement for every child in New
Hampshire

03:50:50.450 --> 03:50:50.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:53.450 --> 03:50:53.460 align:start position:0%
it would be interesting to explore what
 
03:50:56.150 --> 03:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
you just said which is you know if if it
 
03:50:58.370 --> 03:50:58.380 align:start position:0%
becomes a condition for attending a
 
03:51:02.809 --> 03:51:02.819 align:start position:0%
public school could it then be excluded
 
03:51:04.610 --> 03:51:04.620 align:start position:0%
um that would that would put people in
 
03:51:06.769 --> 03:51:06.779 align:start position:0%
the unusual position that homeschoolers
 
03:51:08.570 --> 03:51:08.580 align:start position:0%
could then be mandated the coveted
 
03:51:11.530 --> 03:51:11.540 align:start position:0%
vaccine whereas everybody else would not
 
03:51:14.050 --> 03:51:14.060 align:start position:0%
so it's
 
03:51:17.510 --> 03:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
it's I think it's it's Uncharted
 
03:51:17.520 --> 03:51:19.250 align:start position:0%
it's I think it's it's Uncharted
Territory

03:51:19.250 --> 03:51:19.260 align:start position:0%
Territory
 
03:51:20.389 --> 03:51:20.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:51:27.050 --> 03:51:27.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:28.670 --> 03:51:28.680 align:start position:0%
you agree
 
03:51:31.389 --> 03:51:31.399 align:start position:0%
with a slightly different
 
03:51:35.590 --> 03:51:35.600 align:start position:0%
formulation of the authority of jalcar
 
03:51:39.550 --> 03:51:39.560 align:start position:0%
which is that I believe that the review
 
03:51:43.969 --> 03:51:43.979 align:start position:0%
is whether or not the decision they are
 
03:51:43.979 --> 03:51:45.710 align:start position:0%
is whether or not the decision they are
taking

03:51:45.710 --> 03:51:45.720 align:start position:0%
taking
 
03:51:49.610 --> 03:51:49.620 align:start position:0%
is one that has been
 
03:51:52.370 --> 03:51:52.380 align:start position:0%
one that is within the powers that have
 
03:51:54.610 --> 03:51:54.620 align:start position:0%
been appropriatedly
 
03:51:57.830 --> 03:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
appropriately delegated to them by
 
03:51:57.840 --> 03:51:58.910 align:start position:0%
appropriately delegated to them by
Statute

03:51:58.910 --> 03:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
Statute
 
03:52:03.910 --> 03:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
so the review is in this case
 
03:52:08.030 --> 03:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
is would be very limited because
 
03:52:11.570 --> 03:52:11.580 align:start position:0%
the legislature currently has delegated
 
03:52:14.809 --> 03:52:14.819 align:start position:0%
a fairly broad authority to the
 
03:52:18.769 --> 03:52:18.779 align:start position:0%
commissioner whereas in other statutes
 
03:52:22.010 --> 03:52:22.020 align:start position:0%
we have limited it much more
 
03:52:25.790 --> 03:52:25.800 align:start position:0%
and it's not necessarily a review
 
03:52:31.010 --> 03:52:31.020 align:start position:0%
about every other Statute in
 
03:52:33.110 --> 03:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
the Canon thank you for the question
 
03:52:34.969 --> 03:52:34.979 align:start position:0%
that that is actually my understanding
 
03:52:37.849 --> 03:52:37.859 align:start position:0%
is that it it is not gel car's
 
03:52:40.190 --> 03:52:40.200 align:start position:0%
um responsibility to review every
 
03:52:42.170 --> 03:52:42.180 align:start position:0%
administrative rule
 
03:52:44.690 --> 03:52:44.700 align:start position:0%
um and whether it conforms to the entire
 
03:52:47.510 --> 03:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
body of of revised statutes
 
03:52:50.330 --> 03:52:50.340 align:start position:0%
but rather does it conform to the
 
03:52:52.130 --> 03:52:52.140 align:start position:0%
authority delegated in this specific
 
03:52:54.469 --> 03:52:54.479 align:start position:0%
instance and in this case being the
 
03:53:02.030 --> 03:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:05.389 --> 03:53:05.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:07.450 --> 03:53:07.460 align:start position:0%
are you all set okay
 
03:53:11.389 --> 03:53:11.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:13.070 --> 03:53:13.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
03:53:14.690 --> 03:53:14.700 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative Koval
 
03:53:17.450 --> 03:53:17.460 align:start position:0%
taking the question it's would you be
 
03:53:21.950 --> 03:53:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:24.710 --> 03:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
the oversight committee for DHHS before
 
03:53:26.750 --> 03:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
it goes to rulemaking weighs in on the
 
03:53:30.530 --> 03:53:30.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:33.410 --> 03:53:33.420 align:start position:0%
I am I am concerned about watering down
 
03:53:35.030 --> 03:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
the intent of this bill the intent of
 
03:53:37.190 --> 03:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
this bill is that the legislature the
 
03:53:39.590 --> 03:53:39.600 align:start position:0%
people's Representatives as a body not
 
03:53:41.809 --> 03:53:41.819 align:start position:0%
as a small subset of the body but as a
 
03:53:45.769 --> 03:53:45.779 align:start position:0%
body makes decisions of this gravity
 
03:53:47.809 --> 03:53:47.819 align:start position:0%
um you know they're they're I'll leave
 
03:53:50.510 --> 03:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:53.870 --> 03:53:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:55.610 --> 03:53:55.620 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions thank you
 
03:53:57.349 --> 03:53:57.359 align:start position:0%
representative thank you
 
03:53:59.090 --> 03:53:59.100 align:start position:0%
I'm going to step out for a while and
 
03:54:00.729 --> 03:54:00.739 align:start position:0%
I'm going to turn over the meeting to
 
03:54:03.050 --> 03:54:03.060 align:start position:0%

03:54:04.510 --> 03:54:04.520 align:start position:0%

03:54:38.929 --> 03:54:38.939 align:start position:0%
registered pharmacist and chief of the
 
03:54:41.210 --> 03:54:41.220 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Infectious Disease Control at
 
03:54:42.410 --> 03:54:42.420 align:start position:0%
the division of Public Health Services
 
03:54:43.849 --> 03:54:43.859 align:start position:0%
and the department of health human
 
03:54:46.550 --> 03:54:46.560 align:start position:0%
health health and human services did you
 
03:54:48.050 --> 03:54:48.060 align:start position:0%
bring the microphone a little bit closer
 
03:54:49.670 --> 03:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
there's people watching at home I'm
 
03:54:52.250 --> 03:54:52.260 align:start position:0%
joined with me today by Dr Benjamin Chan
 
03:54:54.710 --> 03:54:54.720 align:start position:0%
an infectious disease physician and the
 
03:54:57.290 --> 03:54:57.300 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire State epidemiologist and
 
03:54:59.030 --> 03:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
we are here today to speak in opposition
 
03:55:02.689 --> 03:55:02.699 align:start position:0%
to House Bill 557 which is stated is
 
03:55:04.309 --> 03:55:04.319 align:start position:0%
relative to the rulemaking authority
 
03:55:04.319 --> 03:55:06.830 align:start position:0%
relative to the rulemaking authority
regarding

03:55:06.830 --> 03:55:06.840 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
03:55:08.570 --> 03:55:08.580 align:start position:0%
point of order
 
03:55:10.790 --> 03:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
um when the Departments come are they
 
03:55:12.349 --> 03:55:12.359 align:start position:0%
supposed to give aren't they supposed to
 
03:55:13.790 --> 03:55:13.800 align:start position:0%
be neutral and only offer technical
 
03:55:15.590 --> 03:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
advice I don't believe they're supposed
 
03:55:18.710 --> 03:55:18.720 align:start position:0%
to oppose or there is no such rule
 
03:55:20.990 --> 03:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
they often choose to just come and give
 
03:55:22.790 --> 03:55:22.800 align:start position:0%
us technical advice but they have a
 
03:55:25.969 --> 03:55:25.979 align:start position:0%
right to Advocate and sometimes some
 
03:55:28.070 --> 03:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
departments not the particularly this
 
03:55:30.290 --> 03:55:30.300 align:start position:0%
one I have seen advocate in ways that I
 
03:55:33.110 --> 03:55:33.120 align:start position:0%
think is far exceeding what I think
 
03:55:34.910 --> 03:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
there should be Authority should be but
 
03:55:37.070 --> 03:55:37.080 align:start position:0%
they have that right
 
03:55:39.830 --> 03:55:39.840 align:start position:0%
um and and particularly as it pertains
 
03:55:41.830 --> 03:55:41.840 align:start position:0%
to their particular
 
03:55:44.809 --> 03:55:44.819 align:start position:0%
area of expertise and control
 
03:55:47.269 --> 03:55:47.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:55:49.670 --> 03:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
thank you so preventing the spread of
 
03:55:51.290 --> 03:55:51.300 align:start position:0%
infectious disease in our schools and
 
03:55:53.389 --> 03:55:53.399 align:start position:0%
child care settings is a important
 
03:55:55.790 --> 03:55:55.800 align:start position:0%
Public Health function we believe that
 
03:55:57.229 --> 03:55:57.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire children and communities
 
03:55:59.210 --> 03:55:59.220 align:start position:0%
are best protected by keeping the
 
03:56:01.130 --> 03:56:01.140 align:start position:0%
rule-making Authority for immunization
 
03:56:03.710 --> 03:56:03.720 align:start position:0%
requirements for the attendance at
 
03:56:06.229 --> 03:56:06.239 align:start position:0%
schools and child care agencies should
 
03:56:08.090 --> 03:56:08.100 align:start position:0%
rest with the Commissioner of Health and
 
03:56:10.189 --> 03:56:10.199 align:start position:0%
Human Services and the department as
 
03:56:13.130 --> 03:56:13.140 align:start position:0%
defined in RSA 141c
 
03:56:15.650 --> 03:56:15.660 align:start position:0%
there's currently a transparent process
 
03:56:18.530 --> 03:56:18.540 align:start position:0%
to remove or add vaccines for school and
 
03:56:22.070 --> 03:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
child care requirement requirements and
 
03:56:24.349 --> 03:56:24.359 align:start position:0%
it also encourages input from all
 
03:56:26.929 --> 03:56:26.939 align:start position:0%
stakeholders including the public and
 
03:56:28.189 --> 03:56:28.199 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
03:56:30.889 --> 03:56:30.899 align:start position:0%
so the department not only engages with
 
03:56:32.990 --> 03:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
clinical and infectious disease experts
 
03:56:36.290 --> 03:56:36.300 align:start position:0%
but the public and policy makers from
 
03:56:38.389 --> 03:56:38.399 align:start position:0%
start to finish during this process
 
03:56:40.670 --> 03:56:40.680 align:start position:0%
first the administrative rules process
 
03:56:43.429 --> 03:56:43.439 align:start position:0%
is transparent open to the public and it
 
03:56:45.349 --> 03:56:45.359 align:start position:0%
considers the input of all stakeholders
 
03:56:47.510 --> 03:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
and an example of this is in September
 
03:56:50.150 --> 03:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
of 2022 we the department worked
 
03:56:52.309 --> 03:56:52.319 align:start position:0%
collaboratively with stakeholders and
 
03:56:54.830 --> 03:56:54.840 align:start position:0%
legislators on the joint legislative
 
03:56:57.050 --> 03:56:57.060 align:start position:0%
committee on administrative rules or gel
 
03:56:59.689 --> 03:56:59.699 align:start position:0%
car to develop a process and a new form
 
03:57:01.610 --> 03:57:01.620 align:start position:0%
which actually reduces barriers for
 
03:57:03.590 --> 03:57:03.600 align:start position:0%
parents and legal Guardians who are
 
03:57:05.150 --> 03:57:05.160 align:start position:0%
seeking religious exemptions for
 
03:57:07.189 --> 03:57:07.199 align:start position:0%
vaccinations for school or Child Care
 
03:57:07.199 --> 03:57:08.630 align:start position:0%
vaccinations for school or Child Care
attendance

03:57:08.630 --> 03:57:08.640 align:start position:0%
attendance
 
03:57:11.030 --> 03:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
second from the last legislative session
 
03:57:14.750 --> 03:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1379 which is similar to this
 
03:57:17.450 --> 03:57:17.460 align:start position:0%
bill that was referred to the Senate to
 
03:57:19.010 --> 03:57:19.020 align:start position:0%
a study committee and that study
 
03:57:20.450 --> 03:57:20.460 align:start position:0%
committee was titled the listing of
 
03:57:22.729 --> 03:57:22.739 align:start position:0%
immunizations for children
 
03:57:24.170 --> 03:57:24.180 align:start position:0%
and that committee was chaired by
 
03:57:27.110 --> 03:57:27.120 align:start position:0%
Senator Kevin avard and the intent of
 
03:57:29.210 --> 03:57:29.220 align:start position:0%
that committee was to review the list of
 
03:57:31.070 --> 03:57:31.080 align:start position:0%
vaccinations for school and child care
 
03:57:34.429 --> 03:57:34.439 align:start position:0%
attendance as a result that committee
 
03:57:36.170 --> 03:57:36.180 align:start position:0%
was comprised of both members of the
 
03:57:39.349 --> 03:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
Senate and the house and the final
 
03:57:41.570 --> 03:57:41.580 align:start position:0%
report of that committee contained
 
03:57:42.889 --> 03:57:42.899 align:start position:0%
recommendations from Individual
 
03:57:44.750 --> 03:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
committee members however it did not
 
03:57:47.090 --> 03:57:47.100 align:start position:0%
issue recommendations based on a
 
03:57:48.950 --> 03:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
majority consensus after a thorough
 
03:57:48.960 --> 03:57:50.269 align:start position:0%
majority consensus after a thorough
review

03:57:50.269 --> 03:57:50.279 align:start position:0%
review
 
03:57:52.550 --> 03:57:52.560 align:start position:0%
and third another outcome of the
 
03:57:54.710 --> 03:57:54.720 align:start position:0%
previous uh legislative session was the
 
03:57:57.530 --> 03:57:57.540 align:start position:0%
passage of House Bill 1045 which as we
 
03:57:59.170 --> 03:57:59.180 align:start position:0%
mentioned previously
 
03:58:01.250 --> 03:58:01.260 align:start position:0%
establishes the ethics oversight
 
03:58:04.010 --> 03:58:04.020 align:start position:0%
advisory committee and legislative
 
03:58:06.110 --> 03:58:06.120 align:start position:0%
oversight was incorporated into the
 
03:58:08.870 --> 03:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
structure of this committee and includes
 
03:58:11.809 --> 03:58:11.819 align:start position:0%
members of both the House and Senate in
 
03:58:13.670 --> 03:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
addition to a diverse group of
 
03:58:13.680 --> 03:58:14.990 align:start position:0%
addition to a diverse group of
stakeholders

03:58:14.990 --> 03:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
stakeholders
 
03:58:17.389 --> 03:58:17.399 align:start position:0%
and should the commissioner consider
 
03:58:20.150 --> 03:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
changes to the list of vaccinations that
 
03:58:21.830 --> 03:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
are required for a school of child care
 
03:58:23.450 --> 03:58:23.460 align:start position:0%
attendance the ethics oversight
 
03:58:26.150 --> 03:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
committee would convene and review these
 
03:58:26.160 --> 03:58:27.530 align:start position:0%
committee would convene and review these
recommendations

03:58:27.530 --> 03:58:27.540 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
03:58:30.410 --> 03:58:30.420 align:start position:0%
and then the department does have a
 
03:58:32.750 --> 03:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
comprehensive review process anytime a
 
03:58:35.389 --> 03:58:35.399 align:start position:0%
new vaccine is added for school or Child
 
03:58:37.729 --> 03:58:37.739 align:start position:0%
Care attendance these decisions are
 
03:58:40.729 --> 03:58:40.739 align:start position:0%
uncommon and infrequent they're actually
 
03:58:42.849 --> 03:58:42.859 align:start position:0%
only made after extensive discussion
 
03:58:45.349 --> 03:58:45.359 align:start position:0%
including input and recommendations from
 
03:58:48.110 --> 03:58:48.120 align:start position:0%
subject matter experts in the fields of
 
03:58:50.889 --> 03:58:50.899 align:start position:0%
medicine and vaccine science and then
 
03:58:53.870 --> 03:58:53.880 align:start position:0%
the last time for example a vaccine was
 
03:58:57.229 --> 03:58:57.239 align:start position:0%
added to this list was in 2003 for
 
03:58:59.090 --> 03:58:59.100 align:start position:0%
varicilla which actually came eight
 
03:59:02.510 --> 03:59:02.520 align:start position:0%
years after FDA and ASAP approval
 
03:59:04.550 --> 03:59:04.560 align:start position:0%
and then in addition to vaccine safety
 
03:59:06.349 --> 03:59:06.359 align:start position:0%
and efficacy the department does take
 
03:59:08.870 --> 03:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
into consideration consideration methods
 
03:59:10.969 --> 03:59:10.979 align:start position:0%
of transmission likelihood of infection
 
03:59:13.370 --> 03:59:13.380 align:start position:0%
and then we also take into account the
 
03:59:15.110 --> 03:59:15.120 align:start position:0%
potential Health impacts for both
 
03:59:17.570 --> 03:59:17.580 align:start position:0%
individuals and communities including
 
03:59:19.490 --> 03:59:19.500 align:start position:0%
those who are most vulnerable and that
 
03:59:21.469 --> 03:59:21.479 align:start position:0%
would also include persons where
 
03:59:23.090 --> 03:59:23.100 align:start position:0%
immunizations May otherwise be
 
03:59:25.790 --> 03:59:25.800 align:start position:0%
contraindicated due to medical reasons
 
03:59:27.530 --> 03:59:27.540 align:start position:0%
which would place them at a higher risk
 
03:59:29.510 --> 03:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
of adverse outcomes
 
03:59:33.410 --> 03:59:33.420 align:start position:0%
and then we do oppose House Bill 557 due
 
03:59:35.929 --> 03:59:35.939 align:start position:0%
to the removal of varicella hepatitis B
 
03:59:37.910 --> 03:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
and haemophilus influenza type B
 
03:59:40.969 --> 03:59:40.979 align:start position:0%
vaccinations when their listing expires
 
03:59:44.330 --> 03:59:44.340 align:start position:0%
in June 2026 these diseases are highly
 
03:59:46.849 --> 03:59:46.859 align:start position:0%
infectious in school-aged children and
 
03:59:48.830 --> 03:59:48.840 align:start position:0%
in severe cases can result in permanent
 
03:59:51.110 --> 03:59:51.120 align:start position:0%
death or disability I will hand that
 
03:59:53.269 --> 03:59:53.279 align:start position:0%
over to Dr Benjamin Chan to discuss
 
03:59:53.279 --> 03:59:56.150 align:start position:0%
over to Dr Benjamin Chan to discuss
further

03:59:56.150 --> 03:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:58.490 --> 03:59:58.500 align:start position:0%
thank you madam Vice chair and members
 
04:00:00.050 --> 04:00:00.060 align:start position:0%
of the committee I will keep my remarks
 
04:00:02.570 --> 04:00:02.580 align:start position:0%
short I just wanted to expand on what Dr
 
04:00:04.670 --> 04:00:04.680 align:start position:0%
tanyan mentioned about uh these three
 
04:00:07.490 --> 04:00:07.500 align:start position:0%
vaccines varicella Hepatitis B virus and
 
04:00:10.670 --> 04:00:10.680 align:start position:0%
haemophilus influenza type B I I
 
04:00:12.410 --> 04:00:12.420 align:start position:0%
understand from representative co-fulton
 
04:00:14.750 --> 04:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
hearing his comments that the intent is
 
04:00:17.650 --> 04:00:17.660 align:start position:0%
to give some time for the legislature to
 
04:00:20.330 --> 04:00:20.340 align:start position:0%
potentially adopt these vaccines into
 
04:00:24.469 --> 04:00:24.479 align:start position:0%
you know RSA 141c however I think our
 
04:00:26.750 --> 04:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
concern here is that if no action is
 
04:00:29.990 --> 04:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
taken and this uh house bill
 
04:00:33.410 --> 04:00:33.420 align:start position:0%
um 557 passes that these three vaccines
 
04:00:36.410 --> 04:00:36.420 align:start position:0%
will be dropped from the required list
 
04:00:38.150 --> 04:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to go into a lot of
 
04:00:40.550 --> 04:00:40.560 align:start position:0%
detail I think you have our testimony
 
04:00:43.189 --> 04:00:43.199 align:start position:0%
there's some information on these three
 
04:00:43.199 --> 04:00:44.809 align:start position:0%
there's some information on these three
vaccines

04:00:44.809 --> 04:00:44.819 align:start position:0%
vaccines
 
04:00:46.969 --> 04:00:46.979 align:start position:0%
um sort of outlining details as to why
 
04:00:50.090 --> 04:00:50.100 align:start position:0%
these vaccines remain on the required
 
04:00:52.729 --> 04:00:52.739 align:start position:0%
vaccination list I will simply leave it
 
04:00:55.189 --> 04:00:55.199 align:start position:0%
at saying that these are highly
 
04:00:56.990 --> 04:00:57.000 align:start position:0%
effective vaccines with the primary
 
04:00:58.729 --> 04:00:58.739 align:start position:0%
Series right so they don't require
 
04:01:02.090 --> 04:01:02.100 align:start position:0%
repeated boosting and that these
 
04:01:05.990 --> 04:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
diseases have the potential to either
 
04:01:08.630 --> 04:01:08.640 align:start position:0%
cause large outbreaks or are highly
 
04:01:10.689 --> 04:01:10.699 align:start position:0%
infectious person to person
 
04:01:14.210 --> 04:01:14.220 align:start position:0%
or have significant and potentially
 
04:01:17.150 --> 04:01:17.160 align:start position:0%
severe Health consequences for people
 
04:01:18.910 --> 04:01:18.920 align:start position:0%
and so just as an example of that
 
04:01:20.750 --> 04:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
varicella the virus that causes
 
04:01:24.710 --> 04:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
chickenpox most people will develop a
 
04:01:27.050 --> 04:01:27.060 align:start position:0%
febrile rash illness the chickenpox
 
04:01:29.570 --> 04:01:29.580 align:start position:0%
illness and most people will develop a
 
04:01:32.269 --> 04:01:32.279 align:start position:0%
mild illness and get better but this is
 
04:01:34.210 --> 04:01:34.220 align:start position:0%
a virus particularly in people who are
 
04:01:36.490 --> 04:01:36.500 align:start position:0%
immunocompromised but even in in
 
04:01:39.050 --> 04:01:39.060 align:start position:0%
immunocompetent people this is a virus
 
04:01:41.269 --> 04:01:41.279 align:start position:0%
that can cause serious disease central
 
04:01:43.790 --> 04:01:43.800 align:start position:0%
nervous system infection meningitis
 
04:01:46.429 --> 04:01:46.439 align:start position:0%
Encephalitis and actually before the
 
04:01:49.189 --> 04:01:49.199 align:start position:0%
Advent of the vaccine it was estimated
 
04:01:52.309 --> 04:01:52.319 align:start position:0%
that about one per 100
 
04:01:55.849 --> 04:01:55.859 align:start position:0%
000 children who got varicella died from
 
04:01:58.370 --> 04:01:58.380 align:start position:0%
their infection right so we don't see
 
04:02:01.550 --> 04:02:01.560 align:start position:0%
severe disease much anymore and in large
 
04:02:04.309 --> 04:02:04.319 align:start position:0%
part it's because of the implementation
 
04:02:07.070 --> 04:02:07.080 align:start position:0%
and high vaccination rates amongst our
 
04:02:09.349 --> 04:02:09.359 align:start position:0%
children and amongst our populations so
 
04:02:10.910 --> 04:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
take a look at the testimony please
 
04:02:13.010 --> 04:02:13.020 align:start position:0%
there's more detail sort of justifying
 
04:02:16.010 --> 04:02:16.020 align:start position:0%
why these three vaccines in particular
 
04:02:18.410 --> 04:02:18.420 align:start position:0%
are on the required list but I will
 
04:02:19.729 --> 04:02:19.739 align:start position:0%
leave it at that and thank you for your
 
04:02:22.250 --> 04:02:22.260 align:start position:0%
time and uh happy to take questions
 
04:02:24.410 --> 04:02:24.420 align:start position:0%
thank you very much before we take
 
04:02:26.030 --> 04:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
questions I do want to make an
 
04:02:27.530 --> 04:02:27.540 align:start position:0%
announcement as many people are coming
 
04:02:30.290 --> 04:02:30.300 align:start position:0%
back in from lunch the only food or
 
04:02:31.790 --> 04:02:31.800 align:start position:0%
drink that is allowed in this room is
 
04:02:34.490 --> 04:02:34.500 align:start position:0%
water because we have had some problems
 
04:02:36.110 --> 04:02:36.120 align:start position:0%
before with coffee and other drinks
 
04:02:38.330 --> 04:02:38.340 align:start position:0%
spilling so if anybody has those I'd
 
04:02:39.950 --> 04:02:39.960 align:start position:0%
please ask them to take them out of the
 
04:02:42.729 --> 04:02:42.739 align:start position:0%
room and now we'll take questions
 
04:02:45.889 --> 04:02:45.899 align:start position:0%
representative McLean
 
04:02:48.050 --> 04:02:48.060 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair and thank you
 
04:02:51.229 --> 04:02:51.239 align:start position:0%
uh for taking my question gentlemen so
 
04:02:54.110 --> 04:02:54.120 align:start position:0%
um you testified uh two quick questions
 
04:02:56.450 --> 04:02:56.460 align:start position:0%
so you testified about the transparency
 
04:02:58.429 --> 04:02:58.439 align:start position:0%
of the rulemaking process and it does
 
04:03:00.410 --> 04:03:00.420 align:start position:0%
sound like it's very transparent but I
 
04:03:02.809 --> 04:03:02.819 align:start position:0%
think the legislature in addition to
 
04:03:04.490 --> 04:03:04.500 align:start position:0%
being transparent there's a certain
 
04:03:06.290 --> 04:03:06.300 align:start position:0%
amount of accountability there you know
 
04:03:07.849 --> 04:03:07.859 align:start position:0%
just ask anybody who's had to kind of
 
04:03:10.429 --> 04:03:10.439 align:start position:0%
stand at the polls so I would just kind
 
04:03:12.170 --> 04:03:12.180 align:start position:0%
of you know follow up on the question
 
04:03:14.330 --> 04:03:14.340 align:start position:0%
that I asked to the prime sponsor what
 
04:03:17.150 --> 04:03:17.160 align:start position:0%
was the driver to kind of move it into
 
04:03:20.030 --> 04:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
the administrative rules role and the
 
04:03:22.010 --> 04:03:22.020 align:start position:0%
second question would just be
 
04:03:23.990 --> 04:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
um understanding that
 
04:03:28.189 --> 04:03:28.199 align:start position:0%
um would you support the bill if um the
 
04:03:31.610 --> 04:03:31.620 align:start position:0%
the three immunizations listed for um
 
04:03:34.490 --> 04:03:34.500 align:start position:0%
song setting in 2026 were moved into the
 
04:03:39.729 --> 04:03:39.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:41.769 --> 04:03:41.779 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:03:44.210 --> 04:03:44.220 align:start position:0%
sure thank you for the question so if I
 
04:03:46.490 --> 04:03:46.500 align:start position:0%
am following correct the first question
 
04:03:49.550 --> 04:03:49.560 align:start position:0%
uh is surrounding the the rulemaking
 
04:03:51.469 --> 04:03:51.479 align:start position:0%
process exactly what was the Genesis
 
04:03:53.750 --> 04:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
because it used to be statues and so
 
04:03:57.229 --> 04:03:57.239 align:start position:0%
there was a migration sure uh so
 
04:03:59.510 --> 04:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
in full transparency that was something
 
04:04:01.670 --> 04:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
that did happen uh prior to my time but
 
04:04:03.590 --> 04:04:03.600 align:start position:0%
from talking with other members within
 
04:04:05.570 --> 04:04:05.580 align:start position:0%
the department as representative
 
04:04:07.790 --> 04:04:07.800 align:start position:0%
colfault had mentioned
 
04:04:11.269 --> 04:04:11.279 align:start position:0%
um one concern that the department does
 
04:04:15.050 --> 04:04:15.060 align:start position:0%
have is if we do have to respond to an
 
04:04:17.330 --> 04:04:17.340 align:start position:0%
emerging or imminent threat related to a
 
04:04:20.269 --> 04:04:20.279 align:start position:0%
communicable disease so the
 
04:04:22.849 --> 04:04:22.859 align:start position:0%
by having it out of Statute and in the
 
04:04:24.650 --> 04:04:24.660 align:start position:0%
administrative rules process and having
 
04:04:27.710 --> 04:04:27.720 align:start position:0%
the commissioner have this Authority it
 
04:04:30.110 --> 04:04:30.120 align:start position:0%
does make our department we have the
 
04:04:31.849 --> 04:04:31.859 align:start position:0%
ability to act more nimbly and swiftly
 
04:04:34.010 --> 04:04:34.020 align:start position:0%
in these cases
 
04:04:36.110 --> 04:04:36.120 align:start position:0%
and I'll just add that it was also
 
04:04:38.630 --> 04:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
before my time as as you heard Dr tanian
 
04:04:40.070 --> 04:04:40.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned the last vaccine that was
 
04:04:41.450 --> 04:04:41.460 align:start position:0%
added to the requirement list was in
 
04:04:43.550 --> 04:04:43.560 align:start position:0%
2003 which was you know a good decade
 
04:04:46.250 --> 04:04:46.260 align:start position:0%
before I started at the state but my
 
04:04:48.229 --> 04:04:48.239 align:start position:0%
understanding also is that it was added
 
04:04:50.929 --> 04:04:50.939 align:start position:0%
to provide more flexibility particularly
 
04:04:52.849 --> 04:04:52.859 align:start position:0%
of vaccine recommendations change which
 
04:04:56.750 --> 04:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
they periodically do to be able to more
 
04:04:59.510 --> 04:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
readily add vaccines or remove vaccines
 
04:05:01.790 --> 04:05:01.800 align:start position:0%
from from the list I think an answer to
 
04:05:03.469 --> 04:05:03.479 align:start position:0%
your second question
 
04:05:06.170 --> 04:05:06.180 align:start position:0%
um you know moving those three vaccines
 
04:05:08.630 --> 04:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
from the rules into the into the
 
04:05:10.969 --> 04:05:10.979 align:start position:0%
legislation you know I think I think
 
04:05:13.370 --> 04:05:13.380 align:start position:0%
that that depends on what happens with
 
04:05:16.010 --> 04:05:16.020 align:start position:0%
this bill and the Authority for for rule
 
04:05:17.450 --> 04:05:17.460 align:start position:0%
making you know certainly if this
 
04:05:19.550 --> 04:05:19.560 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation passes that we
 
04:05:22.969 --> 04:05:22.979 align:start position:0%
would you know support that move into
 
04:05:25.250 --> 04:05:25.260 align:start position:0%
full legislation
 
04:05:28.670 --> 04:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
um but the process as it is now
 
04:05:30.650 --> 04:05:30.660 align:start position:0%
um I I'm not I don't I don't know that
 
04:05:33.050 --> 04:05:33.060 align:start position:0%
there's a huge difference to having with
 
04:05:34.370 --> 04:05:34.380 align:start position:0%
the current process to having those
 
04:05:35.809 --> 04:05:35.819 align:start position:0%
vaccines listed in the in the current
 
04:05:38.689 --> 04:05:38.699 align:start position:0%
rulemaking process versus the you know
 
04:05:41.210 --> 04:05:41.220 align:start position:0%
RSA 141c but there may be you know
 
04:05:43.010 --> 04:05:43.020 align:start position:0%
technical experts that are more familiar
 
04:05:45.110 --> 04:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
with the differences between you know
 
04:05:49.130 --> 04:05:49.140 align:start position:0%
the rules and the and the RS uh the um
 
04:05:51.590 --> 04:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
the law thanks
 
04:05:57.110 --> 04:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:58.790 --> 04:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and also thank you
 
04:06:02.630 --> 04:06:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:04.670 --> 04:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
what I heard was the last time we added
 
04:06:08.590 --> 04:06:08.600 align:start position:0%
a vaccine was 2000 2003
 
04:06:08.600 --> 04:06:10.429 align:start position:0%
a vaccine was 2000 2003
varicella

04:06:10.429 --> 04:06:10.439 align:start position:0%
varicella
 
04:06:13.790 --> 04:06:13.800 align:start position:0%
so that's almost 20 years ago
 
04:06:17.210 --> 04:06:17.220 align:start position:0%
so if we were to lock down and say these
 
04:06:20.990 --> 04:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
are the last vaccine that can be added
 
04:06:23.510 --> 04:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
without legislative approval would that
 
04:06:25.250 --> 04:06:25.260 align:start position:0%
be acceptable to the agency given the
 
04:06:27.410 --> 04:06:27.420 align:start position:0%
fact that we don't do it so often to
 
04:06:34.150 --> 04:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:35.630 --> 04:06:35.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:06:37.610 --> 04:06:37.620 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant so
 
04:06:37.620 --> 04:06:39.710 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant so
um

04:06:39.710 --> 04:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:42.170 --> 04:06:42.180 align:start position:0%
any proposed amendments or changes to
 
04:06:43.790 --> 04:06:43.800 align:start position:0%
this is something that we would probably
 
04:06:46.010 --> 04:06:46.020 align:start position:0%
take under advisement internally at the
 
04:06:47.990 --> 04:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
department we would consult with other
 
04:06:51.229 --> 04:06:51.239 align:start position:0%
subject matter experts we would you know
 
04:06:53.809 --> 04:06:53.819 align:start position:0%
engage the legislature or our other
 
04:06:55.550 --> 04:06:55.560 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and then we would also look
 
04:06:58.130 --> 04:06:58.140 align:start position:0%
to the ethics oversight committee on
 
04:07:01.070 --> 04:07:01.080 align:start position:0%
that topic as well follow-up follow-up
 
04:07:02.630 --> 04:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:07:05.330 --> 04:07:05.340 align:start position:0%
the other part with rulemaking
 
04:07:07.729 --> 04:07:07.739 align:start position:0%
many times I would say many times but
 
04:07:10.729 --> 04:07:10.739 align:start position:0%
there are times in which the CDC will
 
04:07:12.590 --> 04:07:12.600 align:start position:0%
change the frequency in which a vaccine
 
04:07:14.809 --> 04:07:14.819 align:start position:0%
is given not so much the requirement for
 
04:07:16.490 --> 04:07:16.500 align:start position:0%
the vaccine but the way it's
 
04:07:20.090 --> 04:07:20.100 align:start position:0%
administered so would you be
 
04:07:22.550 --> 04:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
commenting if you will if we type take
 
04:07:25.130 --> 04:07:25.140 align:start position:0%
rulemaking away completely then that
 
04:07:27.290 --> 04:07:27.300 align:start position:0%
means that the agency wouldn't have the
 
04:07:29.929 --> 04:07:29.939 align:start position:0%
ability to change the rules to adapt to
 
04:07:34.250 --> 04:07:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:36.710 --> 04:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
yeah I I believe that's correct and
 
04:07:39.050 --> 04:07:39.060 align:start position:0%
that's one of the benefits I think to
 
04:07:41.150 --> 04:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
keeping and one of the intents between
 
04:07:43.010 --> 04:07:43.020 align:start position:0%
why some vaccines are in the rule making
 
04:07:46.729 --> 04:07:46.739 align:start position:0%
process versus in RSA 141c it's exactly
 
04:07:48.469 --> 04:07:48.479 align:start position:0%
for the point that you outline the
 
04:07:51.050 --> 04:07:51.060 align:start position:0%
flexibility to be able to change when
 
04:07:53.150 --> 04:07:53.160 align:start position:0%
vaccine recommendations change right so
 
04:07:55.550 --> 04:07:55.560 align:start position:0%
so we're not necessarily changing which
 
04:07:57.469 --> 04:07:57.479 align:start position:0%
vaccines are added or removed but there
 
04:07:59.570 --> 04:07:59.580 align:start position:0%
may be a change in the frequency of
 
04:07:59.580 --> 04:08:01.070 align:start position:0%
may be a change in the frequency of
vaccination

04:08:01.070 --> 04:08:01.080 align:start position:0%
vaccination
 
04:08:03.110 --> 04:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
um and the rule making process as it is
 
04:08:05.090 --> 04:08:05.100 align:start position:0%
now allows I believe that that
 
04:08:08.269 --> 04:08:08.279 align:start position:0%
flexibility is my understanding
 
04:08:10.610 --> 04:08:10.620 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
04:08:15.229 --> 04:08:15.239 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair because whoever is
 
04:08:18.590 --> 04:08:18.600 align:start position:0%
presiding under our custom and usage is
 
04:08:21.950 --> 04:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
referred to as the chair
 
04:08:23.750 --> 04:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
um and thank you very much for taking my
 
04:08:23.760 --> 04:08:25.370 align:start position:0%
um and thank you very much for taking my
question

04:08:25.370 --> 04:08:25.380 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:08:28.250 --> 04:08:28.260 align:start position:0%
um I just want to be clear
 
04:08:31.189 --> 04:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
it's true is it not that
 
04:08:33.530 --> 04:08:33.540 align:start position:0%
we've been we've been talking about the
 
04:08:36.530 --> 04:08:36.540 align:start position:0%
gel car process which is Byzantine and
 
04:08:39.769 --> 04:08:39.779 align:start position:0%
confusing but prior to the gel car
 
04:08:43.010 --> 04:08:43.020 align:start position:0%
process and prior to a rule being
 
04:08:45.469 --> 04:08:45.479 align:start position:0%
adopted in the first place by the
 
04:08:45.479 --> 04:08:46.610 align:start position:0%
adopted in the first place by the
commissioner

04:08:46.610 --> 04:08:46.620 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
04:08:51.050 --> 04:08:51.060 align:start position:0%
is the commissioner not required to not
 
04:08:55.250 --> 04:08:55.260 align:start position:0%
only hold public hearings on the
 
04:08:57.590 --> 04:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
adoption of the rule before it's adopted
 
04:08:57.600 --> 04:08:59.689 align:start position:0%
adoption of the rule before it's adopted
but

04:08:59.689 --> 04:08:59.699 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:09:02.570 --> 04:09:02.580 align:start position:0%
is that hearing and notice of that
 
04:09:04.969 --> 04:09:04.979 align:start position:0%
hearing not given in a publication that
 
04:09:09.110 --> 04:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
the department puts out regularly that
 
04:09:12.050 --> 04:09:12.060 align:start position:0%
anybody may look up what their what the
 
04:09:15.650 --> 04:09:15.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:17.689 --> 04:09:17.699 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so
 
04:09:20.330 --> 04:09:20.340 align:start position:0%
to answer simply yes okay that is
 
04:09:20.340 --> 04:09:22.849 align:start position:0%
to answer simply yes okay that is
correct

04:09:22.849 --> 04:09:22.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:25.189 --> 04:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
if you know do they hold more than one
 
04:09:27.650 --> 04:09:27.660 align:start position:0%
hearing or just one hearing I know we
 
04:09:29.469 --> 04:09:29.479 align:start position:0%
are at the legislature hold only one
 
04:09:32.870 --> 04:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
it's one hearing okay so we're on the
 
04:09:34.790 --> 04:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
same plane there and could I have one
 
04:09:36.830 --> 04:09:36.840 align:start position:0%
follow-up Madam chair yes
 
04:09:36.840 --> 04:09:38.030 align:start position:0%
follow-up Madam chair yes
um

04:09:38.030 --> 04:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:41.030 --> 04:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
I noticed that you emailed testimony
 
04:09:43.429 --> 04:09:43.439 align:start position:0%
today uh
 
04:09:46.010 --> 04:09:46.020 align:start position:0%
did you hand in a written copy or did
 
04:09:49.130 --> 04:09:49.140 align:start position:0%
you file it online did somebody file it
 
04:09:52.490 --> 04:09:52.500 align:start position:0%
online because our rule is that
 
04:09:55.130 --> 04:09:55.140 align:start position:0%
testimony that's merely emailed doesn't
 
04:09:57.710 --> 04:09:57.720 align:start position:0%
become part of the record and the online
 
04:10:00.710 --> 04:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
testimony or that which is handed in on
 
04:10:00.720 --> 04:10:01.910 align:start position:0%
testimony or that which is handed in on
paper

04:10:01.910 --> 04:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
paper
 
04:10:06.650 --> 04:10:06.660 align:start position:0%
is our testimony so have you filed one
 
04:10:08.809 --> 04:10:08.819 align:start position:0%
of those other ways yes we do have
 
04:10:10.309 --> 04:10:10.319 align:start position:0%
written testimony that we will provide
 
04:10:12.110 --> 04:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
04:10:14.450 --> 04:10:14.460 align:start position:0%
representative mazur thank you madam
 
04:10:16.670 --> 04:10:16.680 align:start position:0%
chair thanks for taking my question
 
04:10:19.189 --> 04:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
um so the CDC has recently implemented
 
04:10:22.130 --> 04:10:22.140 align:start position:0%
the Cova vaccine into their schedule for
 
04:10:24.950 --> 04:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
children correct
 
04:10:27.950 --> 04:10:27.960 align:start position:0%
yes that's correct and but you have not
 
04:10:30.950 --> 04:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire is that correct
 
04:10:34.790 --> 04:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
that is correct can you tell me why
 
04:10:34.800 --> 04:10:38.269 align:start position:0%
that is correct can you tell me why
sure

04:10:38.269 --> 04:10:38.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:40.250 --> 04:10:40.260 align:start position:0%
so uh I will start with that thank you
 
04:10:42.469 --> 04:10:42.479 align:start position:0%
for the question Dr Chan will follow up
 
04:10:46.130 --> 04:10:46.140 align:start position:0%
um so the department has said in
 
04:10:47.630 --> 04:10:47.640 align:start position:0%
multiple different testimonies that we
 
04:10:50.570 --> 04:10:50.580 align:start position:0%
do not intend to require the kova 19
 
04:10:53.570 --> 04:10:53.580 align:start position:0%
vaccine or the influenza vaccine as part
 
04:10:56.870 --> 04:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
of child care or School requirements the
 
04:10:58.849 --> 04:10:58.859 align:start position:0%
reasons for that I will let Dr Chan
 
04:10:58.859 --> 04:11:01.130 align:start position:0%
reasons for that I will let Dr Chan
explain

04:11:01.130 --> 04:11:01.140 align:start position:0%
explain
 
04:11:04.490 --> 04:11:04.500 align:start position:0%
yeah so I will just say that um the so
 
04:11:05.929 --> 04:11:05.939 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:11:08.269 --> 04:11:08.279 align:start position:0%
um and I just want to be clear that we
 
04:11:10.189 --> 04:11:10.199 align:start position:0%
have no intent of adding the kova 19
 
04:11:13.010 --> 04:11:13.020 align:start position:0%
vaccine to the required list of vaccines
 
04:11:16.790 --> 04:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
for um schools or Child Care entry
 
04:11:18.349 --> 04:11:18.359 align:start position:0%
um and the reason for that is very
 
04:11:20.689 --> 04:11:20.699 align:start position:0%
similar exactly that actually the same
 
04:11:22.429 --> 04:11:22.439 align:start position:0%
reason why we don't add the info the
 
04:11:24.590 --> 04:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
annual influenza vaccine
 
04:11:27.050 --> 04:11:27.060 align:start position:0%
um every year as a requirement for uh
 
04:11:29.689 --> 04:11:29.699 align:start position:0%
child care or School entry
 
04:11:33.290 --> 04:11:33.300 align:start position:0%
um and that's because uh it's looking
 
04:11:35.929 --> 04:11:35.939 align:start position:0%
like the kova 19 vaccine will become
 
04:11:38.870 --> 04:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
likely and again this isn't set in stone
 
04:11:41.950 --> 04:11:41.960 align:start position:0%
but likely an annual booster vaccine
 
04:11:44.630 --> 04:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
so there are a number of things we look
 
04:11:46.790 --> 04:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
at when deciding on whether or not to
 
04:11:49.550 --> 04:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
add a vaccine to the required list
 
04:11:52.250 --> 04:11:52.260 align:start position:0%
um all of the vaccines that are on the
 
04:11:55.790 --> 04:11:55.800 align:start position:0%
list now are for diseases that are
 
04:11:57.769 --> 04:11:57.779 align:start position:0%
easily transmissible person to person
 
04:12:00.769 --> 04:12:00.779 align:start position:0%
able to cause large outbreaks have
 
04:12:02.349 --> 04:12:02.359 align:start position:0%
potential potentially severe
 
04:12:04.670 --> 04:12:04.680 align:start position:0%
complications for people that get
 
04:12:08.689 --> 04:12:08.699 align:start position:0%
infected not everybody but certainly a
 
04:12:10.550 --> 04:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
proportion of people that get infected
 
04:12:12.889 --> 04:12:12.899 align:start position:0%
will have severe complications but
 
04:12:16.010 --> 04:12:16.020 align:start position:0%
importantly the vaccines also are highly
 
04:12:18.650 --> 04:12:18.660 align:start position:0%
effective and have very long lasting
 
04:12:18.660 --> 04:12:19.809 align:start position:0%
effective and have very long lasting
protection

04:12:19.809 --> 04:12:19.819 align:start position:0%
protection
 
04:12:24.849 --> 04:12:24.859 align:start position:0%
against infection against disease
 
04:12:27.889 --> 04:12:27.899 align:start position:0%
with just a primary series that does not
 
04:12:31.250 --> 04:12:31.260 align:start position:0%
apply to the kova 19 vaccine as we
 
04:12:33.729 --> 04:12:33.739 align:start position:0%
stated I think in earlier testimony
 
04:12:36.170 --> 04:12:36.180 align:start position:0%
protection against infection and disease
 
04:12:38.809 --> 04:12:38.819 align:start position:0%
wanes over time it Remains the covid-19
 
04:12:40.969 --> 04:12:40.979 align:start position:0%
vaccine remains protective against more
 
04:12:42.530 --> 04:12:42.540 align:start position:0%
severe outcomes of disease and that's
 
04:12:45.469 --> 04:12:45.479 align:start position:0%
the primary goal now of covid-19
 
04:12:47.450 --> 04:12:47.460 align:start position:0%
vaccination but because it's looking
 
04:12:49.309 --> 04:12:49.319 align:start position:0%
like the covid-19 vaccine is moving
 
04:12:51.769 --> 04:12:51.779 align:start position:0%
towards an annual booster similar to why
 
04:12:53.570 --> 04:12:53.580 align:start position:0%
we don't recommend or require the flu
 
04:12:55.490 --> 04:12:55.500 align:start position:0%
vaccine every year we do recommend the
 
04:12:56.689 --> 04:12:56.699 align:start position:0%
flu vaccine everywhere we don't require
 
04:13:00.170 --> 04:13:00.180 align:start position:0%
it for school or child entry similar
 
04:13:02.510 --> 04:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
reasons we have no plans on on adding
 
04:13:04.490 --> 04:13:04.500 align:start position:0%
the kova 19 vaccine
 
04:13:06.170 --> 04:13:06.180 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up
 
04:13:09.110 --> 04:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
follow-up I say this in just but can I
 
04:13:11.750 --> 04:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
get that in writing
 
04:13:14.990 --> 04:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
I I mean it's it's in the um
 
04:13:18.229 --> 04:13:18.239 align:start position:0%
it's in the committee uh the study
 
04:13:18.239 --> 04:13:19.550 align:start position:0%
it's in the committee uh the study
committees

04:13:19.550 --> 04:13:19.560 align:start position:0%
committees
 
04:13:22.490 --> 04:13:22.500 align:start position:0%
report that was filed the one uh chaired
 
04:13:24.769 --> 04:13:24.779 align:start position:0%
by senator avard
 
04:13:26.570 --> 04:13:26.580 align:start position:0%
it actually specifically mentions by
 
04:13:28.030 --> 04:13:28.040 align:start position:0%
name too I guess
 
04:13:30.889 --> 04:13:30.899 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
04:13:33.050 --> 04:13:33.060 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
04:13:35.750 --> 04:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh you you mentioned
 
04:13:39.290 --> 04:13:39.300 align:start position:0%
the immunocompromised and varicella uh
 
04:13:41.450 --> 04:13:41.460 align:start position:0%
can you tell me what the main mechanism
 
04:13:43.389 --> 04:13:43.399 align:start position:0%
of protecting
 
04:13:46.370 --> 04:13:46.380 align:start position:0%
immunocompromised for example in case of
 
04:13:50.750 --> 04:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
Federal cell is it that vaccine gives
 
04:13:54.410 --> 04:13:54.420 align:start position:0%
immunity to immuno compromised or is it
 
04:13:57.290 --> 04:13:57.300 align:start position:0%
more like a herd immunity that other
 
04:14:01.070 --> 04:14:01.080 align:start position:0%
people want transmit it because it stop
 
04:14:01.080 --> 04:14:02.750 align:start position:0%
people want transmit it because it stop
transmission

04:14:02.750 --> 04:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
transmission
 
04:14:04.370 --> 04:14:04.380 align:start position:0%
yeah so thanks for the question I think
 
04:14:05.929 --> 04:14:05.939 align:start position:0%
I think your question is about how how
 
04:14:08.269 --> 04:14:08.279 align:start position:0%
the particularly the varicella vaccine
 
04:14:08.279 --> 04:14:09.950 align:start position:0%
the particularly the varicella vaccine
Works

04:14:09.950 --> 04:14:09.960 align:start position:0%
Works
 
04:14:12.229 --> 04:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
um I I will say that uh that the purpose
 
04:14:16.070 --> 04:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
of um vaccination is for both protection
 
04:14:18.469 --> 04:14:18.479 align:start position:0%
of the individual and also preventing
 
04:14:20.750 --> 04:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
transmission and creating herd herd
 
04:14:20.760 --> 04:14:22.490 align:start position:0%
transmission and creating herd herd
immunity

04:14:22.490 --> 04:14:22.500 align:start position:0%
immunity
 
04:14:22.500 --> 04:14:23.469 align:start position:0%
immunity
um

04:14:23.469 --> 04:14:23.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:26.630 --> 04:14:26.640 align:start position:0%
the I mean the varicella virus the
 
04:14:28.250 --> 04:14:28.260 align:start position:0%
chickenpox virus is one of those virus
 
04:14:32.450 --> 04:14:32.460 align:start position:0%
that is a true Airborne virus and if you
 
04:14:35.090 --> 04:14:35.100 align:start position:0%
look at data on what we call secondary
 
04:14:37.790 --> 04:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
attack rates that's the the rate of
 
04:14:40.189 --> 04:14:40.199 align:start position:0%
transmission in a susceptible population
 
04:14:42.769 --> 04:14:42.779 align:start position:0%
like a household for example if you have
 
04:14:44.630 --> 04:14:44.640 align:start position:0%
a person introduced varicella or
 
04:14:46.189 --> 04:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
chickenpox into a household and the
 
04:14:47.689 --> 04:14:47.699 align:start position:0%
people in the household are not
 
04:14:49.849 --> 04:14:49.859 align:start position:0%
protected not immune
 
04:14:51.469 --> 04:14:51.479 align:start position:0%
um you know the the attack rate is
 
04:14:54.290 --> 04:14:54.300 align:start position:0%
upwards of like 60 to 100 percent and so
 
04:14:56.389 --> 04:14:56.399 align:start position:0%
that applies also to situations like
 
04:14:59.090 --> 04:14:59.100 align:start position:0%
Child Care settings schools where you
 
04:15:01.610 --> 04:15:01.620 align:start position:0%
have because it's an Airborne virus it
 
04:15:03.370 --> 04:15:03.380 align:start position:0%
has the potential for
 
04:15:05.570 --> 04:15:05.580 align:start position:0%
large transmission events large
 
04:15:07.429 --> 04:15:07.439 align:start position:0%
outbreaks and so the purpose of
 
04:15:09.110 --> 04:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
vaccination is to not only protect the
 
04:15:10.729 --> 04:15:10.739 align:start position:0%
individual particularly you know
 
04:15:12.769 --> 04:15:12.779 align:start position:0%
including immunocompromised people
 
04:15:14.929 --> 04:15:14.939 align:start position:0%
against severe complications of disease
 
04:15:18.050 --> 04:15:18.060 align:start position:0%
but also preventing outbreaks like we
 
04:15:22.550 --> 04:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:24.110 --> 04:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
um thank you that's Public Health then
 
04:15:26.689 --> 04:15:26.699 align:start position:0%
has to investigate and respond to
 
04:15:29.090 --> 04:15:29.100 align:start position:0%
um and I have a question for you as well
 
04:15:31.250 --> 04:15:31.260 align:start position:0%
um are the only vaccines that are
 
04:15:33.349 --> 04:15:33.359 align:start position:0%
offered by the state um those that are
 
04:15:35.269 --> 04:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
on this list or is there some other
 
04:15:38.450 --> 04:15:38.460 align:start position:0%
program that um recommends them and is
 
04:15:40.309 --> 04:15:40.319 align:start position:0%
there any sort of encouragement by the
 
04:15:46.250 --> 04:15:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:47.630 --> 04:15:47.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question Madam chair
 
04:15:52.090 --> 04:15:52.100 align:start position:0%
so the as Dr Chan said this is a
 
04:15:57.170 --> 04:15:57.180 align:start position:0%
small list of the vaccines that are when
 
04:15:59.389 --> 04:15:59.399 align:start position:0%
you look at asip as a whole there's 17
 
04:16:01.070 --> 04:16:01.080 align:start position:0%
different vaccines that are recommended
 
04:16:03.710 --> 04:16:03.720 align:start position:0%
for the this age group and population
 
04:16:07.189 --> 04:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
we're discussing there are nine for
 
04:16:09.889 --> 04:16:09.899 align:start position:0%
school age kids that are a requirement
 
04:16:11.929 --> 04:16:11.939 align:start position:0%
for school and child care attendance and
 
04:16:14.450 --> 04:16:14.460 align:start position:0%
then there are 10 for the younger age in
 
04:16:16.010 --> 04:16:16.020 align:start position:0%
the uh specifically the child care and
 
04:16:18.590 --> 04:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
preschool settings so not all ASAP
 
04:16:21.469 --> 04:16:21.479 align:start position:0%
recommended vaccines are required for
 
04:16:21.479 --> 04:16:22.250 align:start position:0%
recommended vaccines are required for
school

04:16:22.250 --> 04:16:22.260 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:16:25.250 --> 04:16:25.260 align:start position:0%
however as part of our vaccines for
 
04:16:28.189 --> 04:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
children program which is a mechanism to
 
04:16:30.410 --> 04:16:30.420 align:start position:0%
purchase these vaccines and provide to
 
04:16:33.170 --> 04:16:33.180 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire providers
 
04:16:36.290 --> 04:16:36.300 align:start position:0%
that when vaccines are approved have an
 
04:16:38.689 --> 04:16:38.699 align:start position:0%
ASAP recommendation and then we discuss
 
04:16:40.809 --> 04:16:40.819 align:start position:0%
it and agree internally
 
04:16:43.969 --> 04:16:43.979 align:start position:0%
at the state if we choose to offer this
 
04:16:46.370 --> 04:16:46.380 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire providers then that
 
04:16:48.229 --> 04:16:48.239 align:start position:0%
would be another mechanism
 
04:16:50.630 --> 04:16:50.640 align:start position:0%
thank you and then as follow-up are
 
04:16:52.309 --> 04:16:52.319 align:start position:0%
there any repercussions on the providers
 
04:16:54.110 --> 04:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
if they have patients who choose not to
 
04:16:58.429 --> 04:16:58.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:01.189 --> 04:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
no so I I think it's important to um
 
04:17:03.050 --> 04:17:03.060 align:start position:0%
differentiate so so the vaccines for
 
04:17:06.050 --> 04:17:06.060 align:start position:0%
children program the vfc program is an
 
04:17:07.250 --> 04:17:07.260 align:start position:0%
access program
 
04:17:10.610 --> 04:17:10.620 align:start position:0%
and it has cost implications
 
04:17:12.769 --> 04:17:12.779 align:start position:0%
um but there's no like repercussions if
 
04:17:14.150 --> 04:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
something like somebody can choose to
 
04:17:16.550 --> 04:17:16.560 align:start position:0%
get vaccinated or not under the vfc
 
04:17:18.410 --> 04:17:18.420 align:start position:0%
program the vfc program simply is a
 
04:17:20.150 --> 04:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
program by which
 
04:17:22.610 --> 04:17:22.620 align:start position:0%
um state government can purchase vaccine
 
04:17:25.250 --> 04:17:25.260 align:start position:0%
at a reduced rate from the federal
 
04:17:26.630 --> 04:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
government on federal government
 
04:17:28.849 --> 04:17:28.859 align:start position:0%
contract and then give it to Providers
 
04:17:31.309 --> 04:17:31.319 align:start position:0%
to administer if the patient chooses to
 
04:17:33.769 --> 04:17:33.779 align:start position:0%
uh free of charge essentially meaning
 
04:17:35.750 --> 04:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
the vaccine is free of charge there's no
 
04:17:37.610 --> 04:17:37.620 align:start position:0%
cost to the person for that vaccine
 
04:17:40.910 --> 04:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
there may be an administration fee for
 
04:17:43.250 --> 04:17:43.260 align:start position:0%
you know Health Care Personnel time for
 
04:17:45.830 --> 04:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
example but there's no charge for That
 
04:17:48.170 --> 04:17:48.180 align:start position:0%
vaccine or somebody can get the vaccine
 
04:17:50.870 --> 04:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
essentially for free and so it's it's a
 
04:17:54.110 --> 04:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
cost access program it has really
 
04:17:56.570 --> 04:17:56.580 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with whether or not
 
04:17:58.309 --> 04:17:58.319 align:start position:0%
somebody chooses to get vaccinated or
 
04:18:01.729 --> 04:18:01.739 align:start position:0%
not and I was under the impression that
 
04:18:04.490 --> 04:18:04.500 align:start position:0%
providers who have unvaccinated patients
 
04:18:07.370 --> 04:18:07.380 align:start position:0%
from that list are financially
 
04:18:09.650 --> 04:18:09.660 align:start position:0%
accountable for that through lower rates
 
04:18:11.689 --> 04:18:11.699 align:start position:0%
or through otherwise having to pay for
 
04:18:13.189 --> 04:18:13.199 align:start position:0%
it when it's done used is there are
 
04:18:15.189 --> 04:18:15.199 align:start position:0%
there financial implications for
 
04:18:17.210 --> 04:18:17.220 align:start position:0%
pediatricians that have unvaccinated
 
04:18:20.570 --> 04:18:20.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:21.950 --> 04:18:21.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so
 
04:18:23.630 --> 04:18:23.640 align:start position:0%
specifically through the vaccines for
 
04:18:25.849 --> 04:18:25.859 align:start position:0%
children program no
 
04:18:25.859 --> 04:18:26.450 align:start position:0%
children program no
um

04:18:26.450 --> 04:18:26.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:29.750 --> 04:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
however I can't speak to the Managed
 
04:18:32.210 --> 04:18:32.220 align:start position:0%
Care contracts that physicians may have
 
04:18:33.889 --> 04:18:33.899 align:start position:0%
independently with managed care or
 
04:18:38.050 --> 04:18:38.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:40.370 --> 04:18:40.380 align:start position:0%
nope another question from
 
04:18:42.710 --> 04:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
representative palazzov thank you madam
 
04:18:44.510 --> 04:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my other
 
04:18:47.150 --> 04:18:47.160 align:start position:0%
question uh can you tell a little bit
 
04:18:51.530 --> 04:18:51.540 align:start position:0%
more uh about uh process of adding or
 
04:18:54.710 --> 04:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
removing vaccines from this list uh you
 
04:18:57.229 --> 04:18:57.239 align:start position:0%
mentioned some criteria that you use but
 
04:19:00.469 --> 04:19:00.479 align:start position:0%
I wonder like what vaccine is closest to
 
04:19:04.130 --> 04:19:04.140 align:start position:0%
be added to the list and also like what
 
04:19:08.030 --> 04:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
you see in any perceivable future some
 
04:19:10.189 --> 04:19:10.199 align:start position:0%
of this vaccines been dropped for
 
04:19:12.889 --> 04:19:12.899 align:start position:0%
example let's for the sake of argument
 
04:19:17.510 --> 04:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
say that poly militis will be I'm almost
 
04:19:21.170 --> 04:19:21.180 align:start position:0%
teledicated worldwide would it be some
 
04:19:23.809 --> 04:19:23.819 align:start position:0%
risk benefit analysis that might be it's
 
04:19:26.750 --> 04:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
time to develop this vaccinations here
 
04:19:29.570 --> 04:19:29.580 align:start position:0%
if we don't see this disease around
 
04:19:34.849 --> 04:19:34.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:34.859 --> 04:19:35.750 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:19:35.750 --> 04:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:37.729 --> 04:19:37.739 align:start position:0%
so if I understand your question
 
04:19:40.130 --> 04:19:40.140 align:start position:0%
correctly it's about adding and removing
 
04:19:42.229 --> 04:19:42.239 align:start position:0%
vaccines and what I will say is that
 
04:19:44.570 --> 04:19:44.580 align:start position:0%
there are not any vaccines that I'm
 
04:19:47.210 --> 04:19:47.220 align:start position:0%
aware of that we are actively discussing
 
04:19:48.790 --> 04:19:48.800 align:start position:0%
adding to this list
 
04:19:52.429 --> 04:19:52.439 align:start position:0%
and in terms of removal there are no
 
04:19:54.889 --> 04:19:54.899 align:start position:0%
vaccines listed here that we would
 
04:19:57.229 --> 04:19:57.239 align:start position:0%
support removal of you mentioned
 
04:19:59.689 --> 04:19:59.699 align:start position:0%
poliomyelitis and I'll just point to the
 
04:20:01.610 --> 04:20:01.620 align:start position:0%
situation occurring outside of New York
 
04:20:03.050 --> 04:20:03.060 align:start position:0%
City right now where they have
 
04:20:06.710 --> 04:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
identified local transmission of polio
 
04:20:09.110 --> 04:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
for the first time in you know decades
 
04:20:12.349 --> 04:20:12.359 align:start position:0%
in the U.S and so you know there's a
 
04:20:14.750 --> 04:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
saying you know disease anywhere is
 
04:20:18.290 --> 04:20:18.300 align:start position:0%
disease everywhere so you know polio is
 
04:20:20.210 --> 04:20:20.220 align:start position:0%
still a problem in other parts of the
 
04:20:20.220 --> 04:20:21.229 align:start position:0%
still a problem in other parts of the
world

04:20:21.229 --> 04:20:21.239 align:start position:0%
world
 
04:20:23.990 --> 04:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
um and the risk for importation
 
04:20:25.610 --> 04:20:25.620 align:start position:0%
um either from other areas of the globe
 
04:20:27.769 --> 04:20:27.779 align:start position:0%
or from other areas of the U.S the risk
 
04:20:31.490 --> 04:20:31.500 align:start position:0%
for importation of um many of these
 
04:20:36.769 --> 04:20:36.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:38.510 --> 04:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions thank you
 
04:20:40.250 --> 04:20:40.260 align:start position:0%
very much
 
04:20:42.290 --> 04:20:42.300 align:start position:0%
next we'll call The Honorable Jerry
 
04:20:42.300 --> 04:20:45.290 align:start position:0%
next we'll call The Honorable Jerry
knurk

04:20:45.290 --> 04:20:45.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:47.210 --> 04:20:47.220 align:start position:0%
who I had the pleasure of serving on
 
04:20:49.070 --> 04:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
that study committee with representative
 
04:20:50.929 --> 04:20:50.939 align:start position:0%
kenark Senator avard and representative
 
04:20:59.809 --> 04:20:59.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:01.189 --> 04:21:01.199 align:start position:0%
and I'll remind you we're doing three
 
04:21:10.370 --> 04:21:10.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:11.990 --> 04:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
yes and for the record Jerry canerkin
 
04:21:14.210 --> 04:21:14.220 align:start position:0%
yes I did serve in the SB 288 Senate uh
 
04:21:16.729 --> 04:21:16.739 align:start position:0%
so study subcommittee and I'm actually
 
04:21:20.030 --> 04:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
here to oppose HB 557 their current
 
04:21:22.790 --> 04:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
system in place in DHHS for determining
 
04:21:24.650 --> 04:21:24.660 align:start position:0%
required immunizations is appropriate
 
04:21:27.110 --> 04:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
and cautious the decision is not made
 
04:21:29.929 --> 04:21:29.939 align:start position:0%
lightheartedly it requires uh when
 
04:21:31.429 --> 04:21:31.439 align:start position:0%
you're going to change it by rule you
 
04:21:34.130 --> 04:21:34.140 align:start position:0%
have the CDC ASAP recommendations and
 
04:21:35.689 --> 04:21:35.699 align:start position:0%
you have to be approved by gel Carr with
 
04:21:37.490 --> 04:21:37.500 align:start position:0%
a public hearing but the point is the
 
04:21:39.050 --> 04:21:39.060 align:start position:0%
department weighs the medical risks of a
 
04:21:40.790 --> 04:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
given disease with regard to its
 
04:21:42.650 --> 04:21:42.660 align:start position:0%
communicability the seriousness of
 
04:21:44.269 --> 04:21:44.279 align:start position:0%
infection and the risks of immunization
 
04:21:46.550 --> 04:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
the department takes into account also
 
04:21:48.530 --> 04:21:48.540 align:start position:0%
the burdens on child care providers and
 
04:21:50.570 --> 04:21:50.580 align:start position:0%
schools to comply
 
04:21:52.729 --> 04:21:52.739 align:start position:0%
all required vaccinations are highly
 
04:21:54.170 --> 04:21:54.180 align:start position:0%
effective in preventing disease and
 
04:21:56.150 --> 04:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
serious outcomes and there are clear
 
04:21:58.189 --> 04:21:58.199 align:start position:0%
mechanisms for children to be Exempted
 
04:21:59.510 --> 04:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
from vaccine requirement for other
 
04:22:02.510 --> 04:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
medical reasons or religious exemption
 
04:22:04.670 --> 04:22:04.680 align:start position:0%
immunization again really important to
 
04:22:05.630 --> 04:22:05.640 align:start position:0%
keep understanding this that
 
04:22:07.070 --> 04:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
immunization has done not just to
 
04:22:08.750 --> 04:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
protect the child being immunized but
 
04:22:11.090 --> 04:22:11.100 align:start position:0%
the other members of the community this
 
04:22:12.410 --> 04:22:12.420 align:start position:0%
is particularly important to protect
 
04:22:14.870 --> 04:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
children who are unable to be immunized
 
04:22:16.849 --> 04:22:16.859 align:start position:0%
or cannot mount a protective response to
 
04:22:18.469 --> 04:22:18.479 align:start position:0%
immunization either due to the fact they
 
04:22:20.710 --> 04:22:20.720 align:start position:0%
have cancer they're immunosuppressed
 
04:22:23.030 --> 04:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
and an infected child in the classroom
 
04:22:24.590 --> 04:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
can easily infect those vulnerable
 
04:22:26.150 --> 04:22:26.160 align:start position:0%
children or probably most at risk of
 
04:22:27.969 --> 04:22:27.979 align:start position:0%
getting complications of the disease
 
04:22:30.889 --> 04:22:30.899 align:start position:0%
rubella is especially a problem a child
 
04:22:33.110 --> 04:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
infected at school can bring it home in
 
04:22:34.490 --> 04:22:34.500 align:start position:0%
fact their mother their pregnant mother
 
04:22:36.950 --> 04:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
leading to her infection and then severe
 
04:22:38.570 --> 04:22:38.580 align:start position:0%
damage to the fetus from congenital
 
04:22:40.729 --> 04:22:40.739 align:start position:0%
rubella syndrome and that is a real
 
04:22:42.229 --> 04:22:42.239 align:start position:0%
problem we don't see much because of
 
04:22:44.570 --> 04:22:44.580 align:start position:0%
vaccination a lot of the checks the
 
04:22:46.670 --> 04:22:46.680 align:start position:0%
vaccination or childhood diseases are
 
04:22:48.710 --> 04:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
indeed rare and it's because of
 
04:22:50.150 --> 04:22:50.160 align:start position:0%
vaccination which is why you don't take
 
04:22:52.490 --> 04:22:52.500 align:start position:0%
them off scattered outbreaks still occur
 
04:22:55.309 --> 04:22:55.319 align:start position:0%
in pockets of immunization that are low
 
04:22:57.410 --> 04:22:57.420 align:start position:0%
in order to prevent an outbreak you have
 
04:22:59.330 --> 04:22:59.340 align:start position:0%
to have a high level of immunization and
 
04:23:01.550 --> 04:23:01.560 align:start position:0%
representative Koval just noted when he
 
04:23:03.170 --> 04:23:03.180 align:start position:0%
made his introduction that making
 
04:23:05.030 --> 04:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
immunizations required rather than the
 
04:23:06.769 --> 04:23:06.779 align:start position:0%
recommended didn't make a big impact
 
04:23:08.750 --> 04:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
because it only increased the rate from
 
04:23:11.689 --> 04:23:11.699 align:start position:0%
about 80 to 90 percent but actually that
 
04:23:14.090 --> 04:23:14.100 align:start position:0%
is important a loss of just a few
 
04:23:15.710 --> 04:23:15.720 align:start position:0%
percent makes a difference and during
 
04:23:18.349 --> 04:23:18.359 align:start position:0%
covid with the decrease in people coming
 
04:23:20.210 --> 04:23:20.220 align:start position:0%
in to see their doctor
 
04:23:22.429 --> 04:23:22.439 align:start position:0%
um and uh there there was a big
 
04:23:24.410 --> 04:23:24.420 align:start position:0%
difference of just three percent in the
 
04:23:26.269 --> 04:23:26.279 align:start position:0%
vaccination rate in Minnesota and they
 
04:23:28.010 --> 04:23:28.020 align:start position:0%
saw an outbreak of measles so it's
 
04:23:30.110 --> 04:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
sensitive you have to keep a high level
 
04:23:31.910 --> 04:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
and it does make a difference whether
 
04:23:34.490 --> 04:23:34.500 align:start position:0%
it's just 80 percent or 90 percent
 
04:23:36.469 --> 04:23:36.479 align:start position:0%
consideration to include a vaccination
 
04:23:38.750 --> 04:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
includes not just the health of the
 
04:23:40.189 --> 04:23:40.199 align:start position:0%
child and the others with whom the child
 
04:23:42.710 --> 04:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
may come in contact but also the health
 
04:23:44.510 --> 04:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
of the school
 
04:23:46.670 --> 04:23:46.680 align:start position:0%
some diseases require a child to be
 
04:23:48.830 --> 04:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
quarantined for a period of time if
 
04:23:50.990 --> 04:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
they're exposed leading to many children
 
04:23:52.670 --> 04:23:52.680 align:start position:0%
then needing to be out of the classroom
 
04:23:55.309 --> 04:23:55.319 align:start position:0%
if somebody comes in with a communicable
 
04:23:57.229 --> 04:23:57.239 align:start position:0%
disease you don't have to do that if
 
04:23:58.849 --> 04:23:58.859 align:start position:0%
they're immunized so that's another
 
04:24:00.110 --> 04:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
important point
 
04:24:01.849 --> 04:24:01.859 align:start position:0%
and as the department has said they have
 
04:24:03.530 --> 04:24:03.540 align:start position:0%
no interest in adding coveted vaccine
 
04:24:04.670 --> 04:24:04.680 align:start position:0%
for the very reasons that were
 
04:24:06.590 --> 04:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
recommended or stated and that is that
 
04:24:07.849 --> 04:24:07.859 align:start position:0%
it's going to appear to be perhaps like
 
04:24:09.710 --> 04:24:09.720 align:start position:0%
the flu vaccine compliance and
 
04:24:11.510 --> 04:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
documentation would be difficult for the
 
04:24:13.070 --> 04:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
schools and child cares and that's why
 
04:24:14.269 --> 04:24:14.279 align:start position:0%
it's not there
 
04:24:16.309 --> 04:24:16.319 align:start position:0%
I disagree with removing the language in
 
04:24:17.870 --> 04:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
lines four and five which would take
 
04:24:19.370 --> 04:24:19.380 align:start position:0%
away the power of the commissioner to
 
04:24:21.110 --> 04:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
add other immunizations by rule when
 
04:24:21.120 --> 04:24:22.189 align:start position:0%
add other immunizations by rule when
necessary

04:24:22.189 --> 04:24:22.199 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
04:24:24.050 --> 04:24:24.060 align:start position:0%
the department should retain that power
 
04:24:25.910 --> 04:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
to implement an immunization requirement
 
04:24:28.130 --> 04:24:28.140 align:start position:0%
under rule in order to deal with a
 
04:24:30.229 --> 04:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
sudden unexpected outbreak of a
 
04:24:31.610 --> 04:24:31.620 align:start position:0%
communicable disease we never know
 
04:24:33.050 --> 04:24:33.060 align:start position:0%
what's going to be coming down the road
 
04:24:36.830 --> 04:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
the legislative process is too slow to
 
04:24:39.290 --> 04:24:39.300 align:start position:0%
respond in a Nimble process now in a
 
04:24:41.450 --> 04:24:41.460 align:start position:0%
Nimble fashion I should say
 
04:24:43.250 --> 04:24:43.260 align:start position:0%
Gathering the legislature in a special
 
04:24:45.469 --> 04:24:45.479 align:start position:0%
session in the situation of an outbreak
 
04:24:47.030 --> 04:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
of a communicable disease would be
 
04:24:49.729 --> 04:24:49.739 align:start position:0%
medically unwise and it would require a
 
04:24:52.490 --> 04:24:52.500 align:start position:0%
two-thirds majority vote to enact a
 
04:24:53.809 --> 04:24:53.819 align:start position:0%
change leaving the department without
 
04:24:56.210 --> 04:24:56.220 align:start position:0%
one of its most important tools to use
 
04:24:58.490 --> 04:24:58.500 align:start position:0%
in dealing with an outbreak we should
 
04:25:00.290 --> 04:25:00.300 align:start position:0%
not tie the hands of our Public Health
 
04:25:02.689 --> 04:25:02.699 align:start position:0%
officials leaving them unable to
 
04:25:04.370 --> 04:25:04.380 align:start position:0%
effectively respond to a public health
 
04:25:07.010 --> 04:25:07.020 align:start position:0%
emergency representative kovalt also
 
04:25:08.330 --> 04:25:08.340 align:start position:0%
discussed using a public health
 
04:25:10.790 --> 04:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
emergency to address this but you know
 
04:25:12.889 --> 04:25:12.899 align:start position:0%
we kind of saw that during covid the
 
04:25:14.150 --> 04:25:14.160 align:start position:0%
Declaration of Public Health Emergency
 
04:25:16.610 --> 04:25:16.620 align:start position:0%
wasn't exactly welcomed with open arms
 
04:25:18.290 --> 04:25:18.300 align:start position:0%
that's not necessarily well received
 
04:25:21.469 --> 04:25:21.479 align:start position:0%
either so in summary Matt oh
 
04:25:21.479 --> 04:25:23.870 align:start position:0%
either so in summary Matt oh
sorry

04:25:23.870 --> 04:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
04:25:26.330 --> 04:25:26.340 align:start position:0%
I was going to say that in in having
 
04:25:28.189 --> 04:25:28.199 align:start position:0%
objected before when somebody was going
 
04:25:32.330 --> 04:25:32.340 align:start position:0%
over I felt it was impelling to object
 
04:25:34.790 --> 04:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
but if you're summarizing I mean I saw
 
04:25:36.290 --> 04:25:36.300 align:start position:0%
where he was when it dinged in summary
 
04:25:38.510 --> 04:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
the current decision-making process uh
 
04:25:40.309 --> 04:25:40.319 align:start position:0%
adding immunization requirements by rule
 
04:25:42.229 --> 04:25:42.239 align:start position:0%
is appropriate to protect children
 
04:25:44.929 --> 04:25:44.939 align:start position:0%
protect the community and maximize the
 
04:25:46.610 --> 04:25:46.620 align:start position:0%
ability of children to stay in school
 
04:25:48.349 --> 04:25:48.359 align:start position:0%
while still respecting parental rights
 
04:25:49.849 --> 04:25:49.859 align:start position:0%
thank you and I'll take questions if you
 
04:25:52.969 --> 04:25:52.979 align:start position:0%
haven't representative Shapiro
 
04:25:54.950 --> 04:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
04:25:56.689 --> 04:25:56.699 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'll ask you the same
 
04:25:59.149 --> 04:25:59.159 align:start position:0%
question I asked the sponsor of the bill
 
04:26:00.710 --> 04:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
which is
 
04:26:00.720 --> 04:26:03.229 align:start position:0%
which is
um

04:26:03.229 --> 04:26:03.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:05.330 --> 04:26:05.340 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that essentially where
 
04:26:08.330 --> 04:26:08.340 align:start position:0%
the legislature currently is delegating
 
04:26:10.370 --> 04:26:10.380 align:start position:0%
the responsibility to Public Health
 
04:26:12.769 --> 04:26:12.779 align:start position:0%
officials and medical officials to make
 
04:26:15.170 --> 04:26:15.180 align:start position:0%
these or at least to facilitate making
 
04:26:17.929 --> 04:26:17.939 align:start position:0%
these decisions I understand that
 
04:26:20.210 --> 04:26:20.220 align:start position:0%
there's a growing distrust of
 
04:26:23.630 --> 04:26:23.640 align:start position:0%
of medical people and Public Health
 
04:26:25.610 --> 04:26:25.620 align:start position:0%
um but I'll ask you the same question I
 
04:26:28.969 --> 04:26:28.979 align:start position:0%
asked representative kofolt which is if
 
04:26:32.269 --> 04:26:32.279 align:start position:0%
this legislation should pass and it
 
04:26:34.130 --> 04:26:34.140 align:start position:0%
should fall to the legislature to make
 
04:26:36.710 --> 04:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
these decisions
 
04:26:39.050 --> 04:26:39.060 align:start position:0%
can you conceive of any way that these
 
04:26:41.990 --> 04:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
decisions could be made with less
 
04:26:44.269 --> 04:26:44.279 align:start position:0%
partisanship and less contentiousness
 
04:26:47.630 --> 04:26:47.640 align:start position:0%
than is currently the atmosphere
 
04:26:50.210 --> 04:26:50.220 align:start position:0%
not really um and I think that we should
 
04:26:52.130 --> 04:26:52.140 align:start position:0%
not be legislating the practice of
 
04:26:54.410 --> 04:26:54.420 align:start position:0%
medicine deciding what vaccinations you
 
04:26:55.790 --> 04:26:55.800 align:start position:0%
know should be there is really basically
 
04:26:57.710 --> 04:26:57.720 align:start position:0%
the practice of medicine Public Health
 
04:27:00.050 --> 04:27:00.060 align:start position:0%
in this case rather than individual but
 
04:27:02.570 --> 04:27:02.580 align:start position:0%
we should not be dictating that as a
 
04:27:05.510 --> 04:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
group of legislators because well to be
 
04:27:07.790 --> 04:27:07.800 align:start position:0%
perfectly blunt there's an enormous
 
04:27:09.889 --> 04:27:09.899 align:start position:0%
amount of misinformation around which a
 
04:27:12.710 --> 04:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
lot of people believe and it is a
 
04:27:14.149 --> 04:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
problem because it makes it difficult to
 
04:27:16.630 --> 04:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
make clear-eyed decisions
 
04:27:22.250 --> 04:27:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:23.809 --> 04:27:23.819 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions thank you
 
04:27:29.330 --> 04:27:29.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:31.610 --> 04:27:31.620 align:start position:0%
and uh we're going to try sticking to
 
04:27:34.130 --> 04:27:34.140 align:start position:0%
that three minutes
 
04:27:35.809 --> 04:27:35.819 align:start position:0%
I'll let this ring a little bit longer
 
04:27:37.429 --> 04:27:37.439 align:start position:0%
for everybody since everybody seems to
 
04:27:40.910 --> 04:27:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:43.729 --> 04:27:43.739 align:start position:0%
honorable members and Senators my name
 
04:27:45.769 --> 04:27:45.779 align:start position:0%
is Dr Merrill Nas and I'm testifying in
 
04:27:50.570 --> 04:27:50.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:53.689 --> 04:27:53.699 align:start position:0%
um by the way many states do adopt the
 
04:27:56.929 --> 04:27:56.939 align:start position:0%
entire asip recommended schedule as a
 
04:27:59.210 --> 04:27:59.220 align:start position:0%
requirement for attending school and
 
04:28:01.010 --> 04:28:01.020 align:start position:0%
it's wonderful that New Hampshire does
 
04:28:01.020 --> 04:28:01.849 align:start position:0%
it's wonderful that New Hampshire does
not

04:28:01.849 --> 04:28:01.859 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:28:03.469 --> 04:28:03.479 align:start position:0%
why should decisions regarding
 
04:28:05.630 --> 04:28:05.640 align:start position:0%
vaccination protocols be reserved to the
 
04:28:08.630 --> 04:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
legislature it's claimed that the DHHS
 
04:28:11.090 --> 04:28:11.100 align:start position:0%
has the experts but the department is
 
04:28:13.309 --> 04:28:13.319 align:start position:0%
unelected not answerable to Citizens and
 
04:28:14.689 --> 04:28:14.699 align:start position:0%
might not always act in their best
 
04:28:14.699 --> 04:28:16.849 align:start position:0%
might not always act in their best
interests

04:28:16.849 --> 04:28:16.859 align:start position:0%
interests
 
04:28:18.950 --> 04:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
um there are four things I want to point
 
04:28:21.590 --> 04:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
out the health department takes its cues
 
04:28:23.510 --> 04:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
and significant funding from the federal
 
04:28:26.210 --> 04:28:26.220 align:start position:0%
CDC during the last three years the
 
04:28:28.849 --> 04:28:28.859 align:start position:0%
federal CDC has shown itself to be both
 
04:28:31.309 --> 04:28:31.319 align:start position:0%
politicized and unable to carry out its
 
04:28:31.319 --> 04:28:33.229 align:start position:0%
politicized and unable to carry out its
mission

04:28:33.229 --> 04:28:33.239 align:start position:0%
mission
 
04:28:34.429 --> 04:28:34.439 align:start position:0%
um I'll point out that the life
 
04:28:37.189 --> 04:28:37.199 align:start position:0%
expectancy has fallen three years for
 
04:28:39.530 --> 04:28:39.540 align:start position:0%
all Americans in that time
 
04:28:41.809 --> 04:28:41.819 align:start position:0%
the headlines tell the story New York
 
04:28:44.450 --> 04:28:44.460 align:start position:0%
Times wolensky citing botched pandemic
 
04:28:47.290 --> 04:28:47.300 align:start position:0%
response calls for CDC reorganization
 
04:28:51.050 --> 04:28:51.060 align:start position:0%
CNN CDC needs a reset requiring support
 
04:28:53.090 --> 04:28:53.100 align:start position:0%
from the federal level new Think Tank
 
04:28:54.769 --> 04:28:54.779 align:start position:0%
report fines
 
04:28:58.130 --> 04:28:58.140 align:start position:0%
Daily Mail CDC is not fit for purpose
 
04:29:00.170 --> 04:29:00.180 align:start position:0%
has lost the Public's trust and needs a
 
04:29:01.969 --> 04:29:01.979 align:start position:0%
complete overhaul says report by
 
04:29:04.550 --> 04:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
agency's former director if I can
 
04:29:06.349 --> 04:29:06.359 align:start position:0%
interrupt you I appreciate those parts
 
04:29:07.969 --> 04:29:07.979 align:start position:0%
of it you can submit those but we just
 
04:29:09.830 --> 04:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
don't want to be going too much against
 
04:29:11.630 --> 04:29:11.640 align:start position:0%
different agencies if you can go more to
 
04:29:13.490 --> 04:29:13.500 align:start position:0%
the facts of this bill
 
04:29:17.689 --> 04:29:17.699 align:start position:0%
yes um so federal agencies
 
04:29:21.889 --> 04:29:21.899 align:start position:0%
have given large Financial grants to
 
04:29:24.349 --> 04:29:24.359 align:start position:0%
State agencies to promote covid as well
 
04:29:26.330 --> 04:29:26.340 align:start position:0%
as other vaccinations but particularly
 
04:29:29.149 --> 04:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
covid five trillion dollars has been
 
04:29:31.309 --> 04:29:31.319 align:start position:0%
spent on the federal pandemic response
 
04:29:35.269 --> 04:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:37.910 --> 04:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
um Financial incentives are likely to
 
04:29:40.370 --> 04:29:40.380 align:start position:0%
result in rule making to mandate
 
04:29:43.429 --> 04:29:43.439 align:start position:0%
vaccinations even of experimental and
 
04:29:46.490 --> 04:29:46.500 align:start position:0%
inadequately tested vaccines and in
 
04:29:48.590 --> 04:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
Maine rulemaking has recently added
 
04:29:50.570 --> 04:29:50.580 align:start position:0%
mandates for both children and health
 
04:29:53.090 --> 04:29:53.100 align:start position:0%
care workers of vaccines
 
04:29:57.830 --> 04:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
third the CDC okay fourth the CDC just
 
04:30:00.830 --> 04:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
added covid messenger RNA vaccines to
 
04:30:02.689 --> 04:30:02.699 align:start position:0%
the childhood schedule only two weeks
 
04:30:05.570 --> 04:30:05.580 align:start position:0%
ago encouraging states to promote or
 
04:30:07.610 --> 04:30:07.620 align:start position:0%
mandate them no wonder New Hampshire
 
04:30:09.649 --> 04:30:09.659 align:start position:0%
hasn't tried to add them because it was
 
04:30:12.769 --> 04:30:12.779 align:start position:0%
only added by the Aesop two weeks ago
 
04:30:15.110 --> 04:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
the bivalent boosters underwent no human
 
04:30:17.750 --> 04:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
testing before their rollout this is the
 
04:30:19.550 --> 04:30:19.560 align:start position:0%
first time CDC put an experimental
 
04:30:21.469 --> 04:30:21.479 align:start position:0%
unlicensed product on the childhood
 
04:30:23.389 --> 04:30:23.399 align:start position:0%
schedule ever
 
04:30:25.610 --> 04:30:25.620 align:start position:0%
such irresponsible Behavior should not
 
04:30:27.469 --> 04:30:27.479 align:start position:0%
be repeated at the state level and only
 
04:30:29.689 --> 04:30:29.699 align:start position:0%
the legislature can be relied on to
 
04:30:32.450 --> 04:30:32.460 align:start position:0%
prevent it we know the risk of covid
 
04:30:34.969 --> 04:30:34.979 align:start position:0%
vaccine-induced myocarditis is high in
 
04:30:38.570 --> 04:30:38.580 align:start position:0%
teenagers up to according to CDC up to
 
04:30:42.830 --> 04:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
one diagnosed case per 5000 doses or 30
 
04:30:45.229 --> 04:30:45.239 align:start position:0%
to 90 times the Baseline risk and I've
 
04:30:47.210 --> 04:30:47.220 align:start position:0%
provided you with graphs from FDA and
 
04:30:49.510 --> 04:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
CDC confirming this
 
04:30:52.370 --> 04:30:52.380 align:start position:0%
yet last month children were being given
 
04:30:54.830 --> 04:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
75 dollar gift cards to get vaccinated
 
04:30:57.649 --> 04:30:57.659 align:start position:0%
in Amherst Massachusetts and the town
 
04:30:59.389 --> 04:30:59.399 align:start position:0%
was paid two thousand dollars by the
 
04:31:02.450 --> 04:31:02.460 align:start position:0%
state to host a vaccine clinic these are
 
04:31:04.070 --> 04:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
vaccines for which the manufacturers
 
04:31:05.929 --> 04:31:05.939 align:start position:0%
have and the state and the government
 
04:31:07.670 --> 04:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
and the federal government have no
 
04:31:07.680 --> 04:31:09.710 align:start position:0%
and the federal government have no
liability

04:31:09.710 --> 04:31:09.720 align:start position:0%
liability
 
04:31:12.349 --> 04:31:12.359 align:start position:0%
so if you could wrap up your testimony
 
04:31:14.689 --> 04:31:14.699 align:start position:0%
four months after an Amherst High School
 
04:31:17.510 --> 04:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
student died during a track meet and it
 
04:31:19.490 --> 04:31:19.500 align:start position:0%
was known that her autopsy showed her
 
04:31:22.250 --> 04:31:22.260 align:start position:0%
death was due to myocarditis
 
04:31:25.250 --> 04:31:25.260 align:start position:0%
and Amherst the Amherst schools hosted
 
04:31:27.889 --> 04:31:27.899 align:start position:0%
this vaccine clinic after one of their
 
04:31:29.689 --> 04:31:29.699 align:start position:0%
own students had died
 
04:31:31.429 --> 04:31:31.439 align:start position:0%
hopefully New Hampshire will be more
 
04:31:32.809 --> 04:31:32.819 align:start position:0%
careful there's never been a more
 
04:31:34.790 --> 04:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
crucial time for you to protect the
 
04:31:36.830 --> 04:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
citizens from overreach by federal and
 
04:31:40.130 --> 04:31:40.140 align:start position:0%
state Executive offices thank you thank
 
04:31:42.469 --> 04:31:42.479 align:start position:0%
you are there any questions
 
04:31:44.330 --> 04:31:44.340 align:start position:0%
and if you could hand the testimony in
 
04:31:45.769 --> 04:31:45.779 align:start position:0%
for our clerk so we can make that part
 
04:31:47.269 --> 04:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
of the record
 
04:31:49.790 --> 04:31:49.800 align:start position:0%
um I only have one copy but
 
04:31:51.950 --> 04:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
um one copy is actually fine because he
 
04:31:53.870 --> 04:31:53.880 align:start position:0%
puts it all into a record so people can
 
04:31:55.849 --> 04:31:55.859 align:start position:0%
see this in the future super it's
 
04:31:59.269 --> 04:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:01.729 --> 04:32:01.739 align:start position:0%
thank you next we have thank you very

hi and you have three minutes and you

04:32:25.910 --> 04:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
read good morning my name is Lynn Lind
 
04:32:28.010 --> 04:32:28.020 align:start position:0%
painter thank you very much for hearing
 
04:32:30.530 --> 04:32:30.540 align:start position:0%
my testimony today I'm a retired doctor
 
04:32:32.689 --> 04:32:32.699 align:start position:0%
I live here in Concord I practiced
 
04:32:34.910 --> 04:32:34.920 align:start position:0%
medicine for nearly 40 years most
 
04:32:37.610 --> 04:32:37.620 align:start position:0%
recently at Concord Hospital I'm here to
 
04:32:40.729 --> 04:32:40.739 align:start position:0%
speak in opposition to House Bill 557
 
04:32:42.769 --> 04:32:42.779 align:start position:0%
and bear with me my testimony begins
 
04:32:44.630 --> 04:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
with a story about when I was a medical
 
04:32:47.510 --> 04:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
student in 1983.
 
04:32:49.550 --> 04:32:49.560 align:start position:0%
that was when I had the opportunity to
 
04:32:51.710 --> 04:32:51.720 align:start position:0%
study and work in Bangladesh for two
 
04:32:53.750 --> 04:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
months and at that time Bangladesh was
 
04:32:56.090 --> 04:32:56.100 align:start position:0%
one of the very poorest nations in the
 
04:32:58.550 --> 04:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
world that probably still is
 
04:33:00.849 --> 04:33:00.859 align:start position:0%
there was essentially no Public Health
 
04:33:03.110 --> 04:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
infrastructure in the country at that
 
04:33:06.470 --> 04:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
time fewer than one in ten children
 
04:33:09.410 --> 04:33:09.420 align:start position:0%
single digit rate of vaccinations was
 
04:33:11.330 --> 04:33:11.340 align:start position:0%
available against communicable disease
 
04:33:14.570 --> 04:33:14.580 align:start position:0%
at that time and it was very common
 
04:33:17.090 --> 04:33:17.100 align:start position:0%
very common for children to die before
 
04:33:19.010 --> 04:33:19.020 align:start position:0%
the age of five
 
04:33:22.250 --> 04:33:22.260 align:start position:0%
think about that for a moment
 
04:33:24.769 --> 04:33:24.779 align:start position:0%
in Bangladesh I witnessed children and
 
04:33:28.429 --> 04:33:28.439 align:start position:0%
babies dying of preventable diseases
 
04:33:31.490 --> 04:33:31.500 align:start position:0%
diseases like tetanus which we also call
 
04:33:34.310 --> 04:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
lockjaw and that is a truly horrible way
 
04:33:37.189 --> 04:33:37.199 align:start position:0%
to die I've never seen even one case in
 
04:33:38.390 --> 04:33:38.400 align:start position:0%
my training
 
04:33:41.689 --> 04:33:41.699 align:start position:0%
or in my practice in the United States
 
04:33:44.090 --> 04:33:44.100 align:start position:0%
and I remember at the time so many years
 
04:33:46.551 --> 04:33:46.561 align:start position:0%
ago suddenly realizing that gosh if
 
04:33:48.769 --> 04:33:48.779 align:start position:0%
these kids had been living in the U.S
 
04:33:50.689 --> 04:33:50.699 align:start position:0%
they would not be dying because they
 
04:33:53.390 --> 04:33:53.400 align:start position:0%
would have been protected
 
04:33:53.400 --> 04:33:54.170 align:start position:0%
would have been protected
um

04:33:54.170 --> 04:33:54.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:56.810 --> 04:33:56.820 align:start position:0%
that was my most Vivid lesson from that
 
04:33:59.810 --> 04:33:59.820 align:start position:0%
entire interesting experience it was to
 
04:34:02.631 --> 04:34:02.641 align:start position:0%
realize suddenly as a young doctor how
 
04:34:05.209 --> 04:34:05.219 align:start position:0%
fortunate I was to have grown up in the
 
04:34:07.849 --> 04:34:07.859 align:start position:0%
United States which was a country with
 
04:34:11.390 --> 04:34:11.400 align:start position:0%
the resources the will and the public
 
04:34:14.090 --> 04:34:14.100 align:start position:0%
health infrastructure and professionals
 
04:34:18.051 --> 04:34:18.061 align:start position:0%
which are successful in protecting its
 
04:34:18.061 --> 04:34:19.250 align:start position:0%
which are successful in protecting its
citizens

04:34:19.250 --> 04:34:19.260 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
04:34:23.390 --> 04:34:23.400 align:start position:0%
protecting me with vaccinations
 
04:34:26.029 --> 04:34:26.039 align:start position:0%
there have been vaccine requirements in
 
04:34:29.209 --> 04:34:29.219 align:start position:0%
this country ever since 1855 when
 
04:34:32.090 --> 04:34:32.100 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts was the first required
 
04:34:34.970 --> 04:34:34.980 align:start position:0%
state to require smallpox vaccinations
 
04:34:38.090 --> 04:34:38.100 align:start position:0%
for school children we that are living
 
04:34:40.250 --> 04:34:40.260 align:start position:0%
today and our children have been well
 
04:34:44.150 --> 04:34:44.160 align:start position:0%
protected it's not surprising to me that
 
04:34:47.269 --> 04:34:47.279 align:start position:0%
we've forgotten as a nation how serious
 
04:34:50.510 --> 04:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
and dangerous these these infections are
 
04:34:52.910 --> 04:34:52.920 align:start position:0%
and how serious they are in an
 
04:34:55.310 --> 04:34:55.320 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated population as we've just
 
04:34:57.470 --> 04:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
heard even a decrement of three percent
 
04:35:01.970 --> 04:35:01.980 align:start position:0%
in a vaccine rate leads to outbreaks
 
04:35:01.980 --> 04:35:03.289 align:start position:0%
in a vaccine rate leads to outbreaks
um

04:35:03.289 --> 04:35:03.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:05.990 --> 04:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
at the same time we have recent memory
 
04:35:08.209 --> 04:35:08.219 align:start position:0%
of an imperfect Public Health response
 
04:35:10.910 --> 04:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
to a terrible epidemic pandemic we all
 
04:35:12.769 --> 04:35:12.779 align:start position:0%
know bad it's present in our minds and
 
04:35:14.390 --> 04:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
we want to do something about it and I
 
04:35:16.789 --> 04:35:16.799 align:start position:0%
sense that this bill may have come out
 
04:35:19.609 --> 04:35:19.619 align:start position:0%
of that wish which is legitimate but I
 
04:35:21.709 --> 04:35:21.719 align:start position:0%
disagree with the means that are being
 
04:35:21.719 --> 04:35:23.390 align:start position:0%
disagree with the means that are being
proposed

04:35:23.390 --> 04:35:23.400 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
04:35:25.689 --> 04:35:25.699 align:start position:0%
we want to be better prepared of course
 
04:35:29.689 --> 04:35:29.699 align:start position:0%
when not if but when the next pandemic
 
04:35:29.699 --> 04:35:32.090 align:start position:0%
when not if but when the next pandemic
occurs

04:35:32.090 --> 04:35:32.100 align:start position:0%
occurs
 
04:35:34.849 --> 04:35:34.859 align:start position:0%
and to me being more prepared now I'm
 
04:35:36.890 --> 04:35:36.900 align:start position:0%
getting to the bill this means we need
 
04:35:38.689 --> 04:35:38.699 align:start position:0%
to strengthen our Public Health System
 
04:35:40.910 --> 04:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
not weaken it
 
04:35:43.131 --> 04:35:43.141 align:start position:0%
it's been responsible for our successes
 
04:35:45.410 --> 04:35:45.420 align:start position:0%
and we don't want to change horses in
 
04:35:47.390 --> 04:35:47.400 align:start position:0%
Midstream and start legislating Medical
 
04:35:50.390 --> 04:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
Care we've been successful Take the Long
 
04:35:50.400 --> 04:35:51.410 align:start position:0%
Care we've been successful Take the Long
View

04:35:51.410 --> 04:35:51.420 align:start position:0%
View
 
04:35:53.209 --> 04:35:53.219 align:start position:0%
this bill would weaken it by removing
 
04:35:54.769 --> 04:35:54.779 align:start position:0%
the rulemaking authority of the
 
04:35:56.209 --> 04:35:56.219 align:start position:0%
commissioner that we've already heard
 
04:35:59.631 --> 04:35:59.641 align:start position:0%
quite a bit about I won't repeat that
 
04:36:01.551 --> 04:36:01.561 align:start position:0%
if you could wrap up you're already past
 
04:36:03.949 --> 04:36:03.959 align:start position:0%
three minutes please yes I just would
 
04:36:04.970 --> 04:36:04.980 align:start position:0%
ask you
 
04:36:08.029 --> 04:36:08.039 align:start position:0%
as elected officials to and continue to
 
04:36:10.551 --> 04:36:10.561 align:start position:0%
entrust these scientific judgments to
 
04:36:12.410 --> 04:36:12.420 align:start position:0%
the public health professionals and to
 
04:36:14.570 --> 04:36:14.580 align:start position:0%
support their work in other ways thank
 
04:36:16.010 --> 04:36:16.020 align:start position:0%
you very much I'll be happy to answer
 
04:36:17.689 --> 04:36:17.699 align:start position:0%

thank you are there any questions
 
04:36:22.010 --> 04:36:22.020 align:start position:0%
and if you have a copy of your written
 
04:36:23.689 --> 04:36:23.699 align:start position:0%
testimony the clerk would love that
 
04:36:27.051 --> 04:36:27.061 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:29.631 --> 04:36:29.641 align:start position:0%

04:36:37.010 --> 04:36:37.020 align:start position:0%
it's a sad way to find out thank you
 
04:36:42.051 --> 04:36:42.061 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:45.109 --> 04:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
and three minutes Laura

vaccines at DHHS requires and purchases
 
04:37:16.010 --> 04:37:16.020 align:start position:0%
and sells when the legislature gave the
 
04:37:17.330 --> 04:37:17.340 align:start position:0%
commissioner authority to determine
 
04:37:19.189 --> 04:37:19.199 align:start position:0%
vaccine requirements by rule there are
 
04:37:21.109 --> 04:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
only seven vaccines listed in statute
 
04:37:23.510 --> 04:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
and DHHS was not in the vaccine business
 
04:37:26.150 --> 04:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
much has changed since then and Time Has
 
04:37:27.650 --> 04:37:27.660 align:start position:0%
Come For The expansive inclusive
 
04:37:29.810 --> 04:37:29.820 align:start position:0%

any additional vaccine requirements
 
04:37:32.990 --> 04:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
imposed on children to relieve the
 
04:37:35.269 --> 04:37:35.279 align:start position:0%
commissioner of that Authority also
 
04:37:37.070 --> 04:37:37.080 align:start position:0%
since that time DHHS has put in the
 
04:37:39.890 --> 04:37:39.900 align:start position:0%
vaccine business per RSA 126q capturing
 
04:37:41.689 --> 04:37:41.699 align:start position:0%
and fully controlling the entire Market
 
04:37:43.910 --> 04:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
of vaccines targeted at children
 
04:37:45.289 --> 04:37:45.299 align:start position:0%
per the New Hampshire vaccine
 
04:37:47.631 --> 04:37:47.641 align:start position:0%
Association for fiscal year 2022 there's
 
04:37:49.789 --> 04:37:49.799 align:start position:0%
expected vaccine participle the 33
 
04:37:51.709 --> 04:37:51.719 align:start position:0%
million dollars what was once a two
 
04:37:53.150 --> 04:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
million dollar vaccine purchase program
 
04:37:55.849 --> 04:37:55.859 align:start position:0%
in 2000 and 2 has now become a big
 
04:37:58.789 --> 04:37:58.799 align:start position:0%
business for DHHS this is an unchecked
 
04:38:00.230 --> 04:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
unaccountable State vaccine business
 
04:38:02.209 --> 04:38:02.219 align:start position:0%
there's no public input to vaccine
 
04:38:04.250 --> 04:38:04.260 align:start position:0%
selections and more costly combo
 
04:38:05.631 --> 04:38:05.641 align:start position:0%
vaccines are being purchased as a
 
04:38:07.849 --> 04:38:07.859 align:start position:0%
combined three four five vaccines in one
 
04:38:09.410 --> 04:38:09.420 align:start position:0%
shot all at once parents no longer have
 
04:38:10.970 --> 04:38:10.980 align:start position:0%
the option of getting just one vaccine
 
04:38:13.010 --> 04:38:13.020 align:start position:0%
at a time there's no reporting in any
 
04:38:15.609 --> 04:38:15.619 align:start position:0%
measurable health benefits
 
04:38:18.529 --> 04:38:18.539 align:start position:0%
DHHS purchases vaccines from the CDC and
 
04:38:20.449 --> 04:38:20.459 align:start position:0%
is rewarded with grant money to run
 
04:38:22.070 --> 04:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
their immunization division there now
 
04:38:23.869 --> 04:38:23.879 align:start position:0%
exists a huge financial incentive to
 
04:38:25.910 --> 04:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
mandate and sell as many vaccines as
 
04:38:27.830 --> 04:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
possible this of course conflicts with
 
04:38:29.269 --> 04:38:29.279 align:start position:0%
the duty of Public Health to protect
 
04:38:31.250 --> 04:38:31.260 align:start position:0%
Public Health from harm one cannot
 
04:38:32.810 --> 04:38:32.820 align:start position:0%
ethically be in the business of buying
 
04:38:34.730 --> 04:38:34.740 align:start position:0%
and selling vaccines and also overseeing
 
04:38:36.830 --> 04:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
Public Safety with regard to vaccine use
 
04:38:38.631 --> 04:38:38.641 align:start position:0%
the commission should be relieved of
 
04:38:40.970 --> 04:38:40.980 align:start position:0%
this terrible conflict of interest oh my
 
04:38:42.470 --> 04:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
gosh how do we ever get to this many
 
04:38:44.631 --> 04:38:44.641 align:start position:0%
doses many people think it's three or
 
04:38:46.429 --> 04:38:46.439 align:start position:0%
four shots we got here because of
 
04:38:48.289 --> 04:38:48.299 align:start position:0%
vaccine failure while many think that
 
04:38:49.609 --> 04:38:49.619 align:start position:0%
vaccine failure is a new thing because
 
04:38:51.170 --> 04:38:51.180 align:start position:0%
of the total failure of the coveted
 
04:38:53.209 --> 04:38:53.219 align:start position:0%
shots to prevent infection illness or
 
04:38:54.769 --> 04:38:54.779 align:start position:0%
spread vaccine failure has been with us
 
04:38:57.109 --> 04:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
since the beginning of vaccine use the
 
04:38:58.551 --> 04:38:58.561 align:start position:0%
vaccines you may have gotten 50 years
 
04:39:00.230 --> 04:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
ago have long since been pulled for the
 
04:39:02.150 --> 04:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
market for either vaccine failure or
 
04:39:04.490 --> 04:39:04.500 align:start position:0%
harm or both give me again I'm going to
 
04:39:06.709 --> 04:39:06.719 align:start position:0%
give you an example the Hepatitis B that
 
04:39:09.529 --> 04:39:09.539 align:start position:0%
they've added the conflicts with it Dr
 
04:39:11.510 --> 04:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
Chan's testimony the Hepatitis B is an
 
04:39:13.970 --> 04:39:13.980 align:start position:0%
adult lifestyle illness caused mostly by
 
04:39:17.090 --> 04:39:17.100 align:start position:0%
per the CDC Italy go IV drug abusers and
 
04:39:19.131 --> 04:39:19.141 align:start position:0%
men who have sex with men it is not an
 
04:39:21.289 --> 04:39:21.299 align:start position:0%
illness of childhood and should never
 
04:39:23.390 --> 04:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
have been added as a daycare and school
 
04:39:23.400 --> 04:39:25.070 align:start position:0%
have been added as a daycare and school
requirement

04:39:25.070 --> 04:39:25.080 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
04:39:26.631 --> 04:39:26.641 align:start position:0%
something as serious the vaccines
 
04:39:28.070 --> 04:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
requires a full and thorough review
 
04:39:30.289 --> 04:39:30.299 align:start position:0%
before imposing requirements on children
 
04:39:32.510 --> 04:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
or adults especially the new coveted
 
04:39:34.429 --> 04:39:34.439 align:start position:0%
shots only the legislature is positioned
 
04:39:35.929 --> 04:39:35.939 align:start position:0%
to provide the thorough and complete
 
04:39:38.030 --> 04:39:38.040 align:start position:0%
evaluation of all possible need for
 
04:39:39.890 --> 04:39:39.900 align:start position:0%
vaccines the benefits risk and failures
 
04:39:42.110 --> 04:39:42.120 align:start position:0%
it is only in this venue that all people
 
04:39:44.208 --> 04:39:44.218 align:start position:0%
can weigh in including doctors and
 
04:39:46.070 --> 04:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
various other medical experts in
 
04:39:47.810 --> 04:39:47.820 align:start position:0%
addition to the parents whose legal
 
04:39:49.610 --> 04:39:49.620 align:start position:0%
responsibility and loving duties to care
 
04:39:51.470 --> 04:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
for and protect their children from harm
 
04:39:53.330 --> 04:39:53.340 align:start position:0%
there are many eyes and Minds involved
 
04:39:55.430 --> 04:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
in this legislative process and there is
 
04:39:57.830 --> 04:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
no process more thorough whereas the
 
04:39:59.690 --> 04:39:59.700 align:start position:0%
rulemaking process allows I'm wrapping
 
04:40:01.610 --> 04:40:01.620 align:start position:0%
up the commissioner to impose any and
 
04:40:03.470 --> 04:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
all vaccine requirements that he desires
 
04:40:05.510 --> 04:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
and I can tell you is one who's probably
 
04:40:08.390 --> 04:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
attempted to to testify before gel carb
 
04:40:10.310 --> 04:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
more than anybody else in the state it
 
04:40:13.190 --> 04:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
is not an open process you often do not
 
04:40:14.690 --> 04:40:14.700 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to testify and
 
04:40:16.130 --> 04:40:16.140 align:start position:0%
often or shut out
 
04:40:18.350 --> 04:40:18.360 align:start position:0%
with DHHS now being in the vaccine
 
04:40:20.030 --> 04:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
business it would be appropriate for the
 
04:40:21.530 --> 04:40:21.540 align:start position:0%
legislature to remove the commissioner's
 
04:40:23.930 --> 04:40:23.940 align:start position:0%
Authority and retake their legislative
 
04:40:25.910 --> 04:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
Authority and duty to perform to
 
04:40:27.890 --> 04:40:27.900 align:start position:0%
determine vaccine requirements I urge
 
04:40:31.670 --> 04:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
House Bill 557 as ought to pass and if I
 
04:40:35.090 --> 04:40:35.100 align:start position:0%
may representative land you asked a
 
04:40:37.550 --> 04:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
couple of questions about
 
04:40:39.890 --> 04:40:39.900 align:start position:0%
um so we can put that into questions for
 
04:40:42.770 --> 04:40:42.780 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you that Dr Chan did not
 
04:40:44.390 --> 04:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
provide you with answers for but I have
 
04:40:45.590 --> 04:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
answers for you
 
04:40:46.970 --> 04:40:46.980 align:start position:0%
do you have a question for me thank you
 
04:40:49.670 --> 04:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
yes I have a question our providers uh
 
04:40:51.708 --> 04:40:51.718 align:start position:0%
penalized if they do not provide the
 
04:40:53.150 --> 04:40:53.160 align:start position:0%
vaccines and the vaccines for children
 
04:40:56.750 --> 04:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
program in in fact providers um the DHHS
 
04:40:58.550 --> 04:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
has taken captive the entire child
 
04:41:01.310 --> 04:41:01.320 align:start position:0%
vaccine Market in New Hampshire doctors
 
04:41:03.350 --> 04:41:03.360 align:start position:0%
are not allowed to purchase their own
 
04:41:04.670 --> 04:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
vaccines and maintain their own
 
04:41:06.948 --> 04:41:06.958 align:start position:0%
inventory they must take inventory from
 
04:41:09.770 --> 04:41:09.780 align:start position:0%
DHHS in order to get that inventory they
 
04:41:12.288 --> 04:41:12.298 align:start position:0%
must sign a contract as a vfc contract
 
04:41:14.330 --> 04:41:14.340 align:start position:0%
and I'd provide you with a copy that
 
04:41:16.730 --> 04:41:16.740 align:start position:0%
says that they shall take all vaccines
 
04:41:19.250 --> 04:41:19.260 align:start position:0%
and promote all vaccines furthermore the
 
04:41:21.770 --> 04:41:21.780 align:start position:0%
CDC requires that they are personally
 
04:41:24.708 --> 04:41:24.718 align:start position:0%
liable for any wasted vaccine so a
 
04:41:26.750 --> 04:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
couple of contracts they they must abide
 
04:41:28.550 --> 04:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
by could you provide those to the
 
04:41:30.530 --> 04:41:30.540 align:start position:0%
committee in writing I I certainly will
 
04:41:35.330 --> 04:41:35.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:37.610 --> 04:41:37.620 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for wealth of
 
04:41:40.128 --> 04:41:40.138 align:start position:0%
information as always yeah you would
 
04:41:41.990 --> 04:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
also asked why the somebody had asked
 
04:41:43.730 --> 04:41:43.740 align:start position:0%
why the coveted shots weren't required
 
04:41:46.310 --> 04:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
and Dr Chan said that those are
 
04:41:46.320 --> 04:41:47.590 align:start position:0%
and Dr Chan said that those are
anticipated

04:41:47.590 --> 04:41:47.600 align:start position:0%
anticipated
 
04:41:50.150 --> 04:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
if we could call hold everybody to the
 
04:41:53.330 --> 04:41:53.340 align:start position:0%
same standards yes we we held everybody
 
04:41:55.128 --> 04:41:55.138 align:start position:0%
to that time if you'd like to add that
 
04:41:56.930 --> 04:41:56.940 align:start position:0%
email to the committee with that extra
 
04:41:58.610 --> 04:41:58.620 align:start position:0%
information about why it wasn't added
 
04:42:00.890 --> 04:42:00.900 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
04:42:02.448 --> 04:42:02.458 align:start position:0%
and if he could bring your testimony
 
04:42:07.990 --> 04:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:11.030 --> 04:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
electronic access that that wasn't part
 
04:42:12.470 --> 04:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
of the record that's also part of the
 
04:42:14.208 --> 04:42:14.218 align:start position:0%
record this is also another way to
 
04:42:15.708 --> 04:42:15.718 align:start position:0%
capture it to make sure that both the
 
04:42:17.208 --> 04:42:17.218 align:start position:0%
digital and the in-person are
 
04:42:19.368 --> 04:42:19.378 align:start position:0%
appropriately included and and just to
 
04:42:22.250 --> 04:42:22.260 align:start position:0%
be clear I was only concerned about
 
04:42:24.770 --> 04:42:24.780 align:start position:0%
somebody who had only emailed not the
 
04:42:27.530 --> 04:42:27.540 align:start position:0%
people who submitted the testimony
 
04:42:30.948 --> 04:42:30.958 align:start position:0%
electronically through that process and
 
04:42:34.970 --> 04:42:34.980 align:start position:0%
I will also say that we do actually read
 
04:42:38.390 --> 04:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
our emails and and so I often get
 
04:42:41.090 --> 04:42:41.100 align:start position:0%
supplemental uh clarification from
 
04:42:41.100 --> 04:42:42.050 align:start position:0%
supplemental uh clarification from
people

04:42:42.050 --> 04:42:42.060 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:42:44.990 --> 04:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
yes and thank you next we have Dr
 
04:42:46.310 --> 04:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
Jennifer Smith
 
04:42:49.970 --> 04:42:49.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:52.310 --> 04:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
welcome back thank you um

um and members of the committee
 
04:42:58.070 --> 04:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
um I do not have written testimony I
 
04:42:59.930 --> 04:42:59.940 align:start position:0%
like the power of story and I hope there
 
04:43:01.788 --> 04:43:01.798 align:start position:0%
are enough of you here to
 
04:43:05.270 --> 04:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
deal with that and and keep it in mind
 
04:43:05.280 --> 04:43:05.990 align:start position:0%
deal with that and and keep it in mind
um

04:43:05.990 --> 04:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:08.868 --> 04:43:08.878 align:start position:0%
20 years ago almost I decided I really
 
04:43:10.430 --> 04:43:10.440 align:start position:0%
wanted a public health degree in
 
04:43:12.530 --> 04:43:12.540 align:start position:0%
addition to my medical degree and I
 
04:43:14.868 --> 04:43:14.878 align:start position:0%
started working part-time at New
 
04:43:16.670 --> 04:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital providing Medical
 
04:43:16.680 --> 04:43:17.810 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital providing Medical
Care

04:43:17.810 --> 04:43:17.820 align:start position:0%
Care
 
04:43:20.150 --> 04:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
for people with chronic
 
04:43:24.650 --> 04:43:24.660 align:start position:0%
mental illness and I started studying
 
04:43:26.270 --> 04:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
Public Health at Dartmouth
 
04:43:30.410 --> 04:43:30.420 align:start position:0%
and very pleased with that education and
 
04:43:32.390 --> 04:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
part way through that the the medical
 
04:43:35.868 --> 04:43:35.878 align:start position:0%
director of New Hampshire hospital asked
 
04:43:35.878 --> 04:43:36.770 align:start position:0%
director of New Hampshire hospital asked
me

04:43:36.770 --> 04:43:36.780 align:start position:0%
me
 
04:43:40.368 --> 04:43:40.378 align:start position:0%
to comment on the request he had for New
 
04:43:41.930 --> 04:43:41.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital to do certain things
 
04:43:45.170 --> 04:43:45.180 align:start position:0%
under a pandemic response
 
04:43:48.708 --> 04:43:48.718 align:start position:0%
it was really eye-opening to see how
 
04:43:51.110 --> 04:43:51.120 align:start position:0%
poorly things were being planned on
 
04:43:54.170 --> 04:43:54.180 align:start position:0%
pandemic response and that's been true
 
04:43:54.180 --> 04:43:56.708 align:start position:0%
pandemic response and that's been true
and

04:43:56.708 --> 04:43:56.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:43:59.030 --> 04:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
compounded our difficulties in the early
 
04:44:01.128 --> 04:44:01.138 align:start position:0%
stages of this pandemic
 
04:44:04.670 --> 04:44:04.680 align:start position:0%
and we had probably a far greater loss
 
04:44:07.970 --> 04:44:07.980 align:start position:0%
of people than we needed to have because
 
04:44:09.170 --> 04:44:09.180 align:start position:0%
of that
 
04:44:11.930 --> 04:44:11.940 align:start position:0%
and getting into that why that happened
 
04:44:15.948 --> 04:44:15.958 align:start position:0%
is hard to say but just be aware
 
04:44:19.430 --> 04:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
this is not the last pandemic that
 
04:44:21.470 --> 04:44:21.480 align:start position:0%
younger people are likely to see and
 
04:44:23.990 --> 04:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
maybe some of us old people too
 
04:44:26.868 --> 04:44:26.878 align:start position:0%
this was not the pandemic that when I
 
04:44:29.628 --> 04:44:29.638 align:start position:0%
was studying Public Health we expected
 
04:44:31.850 --> 04:44:31.860 align:start position:0%
to see sometime soon and actually we've
 
04:44:33.890 --> 04:44:33.900 align:start position:0%
been talking about it before I studied
 
04:44:35.150 --> 04:44:35.160 align:start position:0%
Public Health
 
04:44:38.330 --> 04:44:38.340 align:start position:0%
we expected another influenza pandemic
 
04:44:41.350 --> 04:44:41.360 align:start position:0%
similar to 1819
 
04:44:44.330 --> 04:44:44.340 align:start position:0%
00 18 1919
 
04:44:47.510 --> 04:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
and that was truly a terrible
 
04:44:49.788 --> 04:44:49.798 align:start position:0%
pandemic there was no chance of
 
04:44:51.830 --> 04:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
immunization for that
 
04:44:54.708 --> 04:44:54.718 align:start position:0%
and it actually didn't stop in two years
 
04:44:58.070 --> 04:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
it took three years and people got so
 
04:44:59.750 --> 04:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
much pandemic fatigue that people
 
04:45:02.628 --> 04:45:02.638 align:start position:0%
started ignoring at the third year you
 
04:45:05.150 --> 04:45:05.160 align:start position:0%
see I still have my mask on
 
04:45:07.368 --> 04:45:07.378 align:start position:0%
I will continue to do that in places
 
04:45:09.770 --> 04:45:09.780 align:start position:0%
where I just don't know enough about who
 
04:45:11.270 --> 04:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
I'm with
 
04:45:13.730 --> 04:45:13.740 align:start position:0%
because I think it's really serious and
 
04:45:16.250 --> 04:45:16.260 align:start position:0%
that could happen again and when we see
 
04:45:19.190 --> 04:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
that happen again if another major
 
04:45:22.730 --> 04:45:22.740 align:start position:0%
pandemic influenza hits I think we need
 
04:45:24.170 --> 04:45:24.180 align:start position:0%
the ability
 
04:45:27.530 --> 04:45:27.540 align:start position:0%
to mandate a vaccine for children if
 
04:45:29.570 --> 04:45:29.580 align:start position:0%
it's hitting them hard
 
04:45:32.868 --> 04:45:32.878 align:start position:0%
and and some of the pandemic
 
04:45:35.208 --> 04:45:35.218 align:start position:0%
strains we've seen which have not been
 
04:45:38.510 --> 04:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
anything like the 1918-1919 have hit
 
04:45:41.690 --> 04:45:41.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:44.270 --> 04:45:44.280 align:start position:0%
um and so I think that's important and
 
04:45:45.890 --> 04:45:45.900 align:start position:0%
then if I have a little more time I'll
 
04:45:47.750 --> 04:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
just comment
 
04:45:49.850 --> 04:45:49.860 align:start position:0%
you're just at the end of your time
 
04:45:49.860 --> 04:45:51.470 align:start position:0%
you're just at the end of your time
smallpox

04:45:51.470 --> 04:45:51.480 align:start position:0%
smallpox
 
04:45:54.410 --> 04:45:54.420 align:start position:0%
was very controversial in terms of both
 
04:45:56.570 --> 04:45:56.580 align:start position:0%
first the variolation which is an
 
04:45:59.390 --> 04:45:59.400 align:start position:0%
immunization and then vaccination once
 
04:46:00.610 --> 04:46:00.620 align:start position:0%
that became available the
 
04:46:02.570 --> 04:46:02.580 align:start position:0%
commander-in-chief of the Continental
 
04:46:05.270 --> 04:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
Army decided that everyone had to have
 
04:46:08.090 --> 04:46:08.100 align:start position:0%
smallpox vaccination without that we
 
04:46:09.170 --> 04:46:09.180 align:start position:0%
probably would have lost the
 
04:46:11.510 --> 04:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
Revolutionary War it wasn't vaccination
 
04:46:14.448 --> 04:46:14.458 align:start position:0%
excuse me very elation
 
04:46:16.190 --> 04:46:16.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
04:46:18.470 --> 04:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
and that inoculation history
 
04:46:21.230 --> 04:46:21.240 align:start position:0%
are there any questions no thank you
 
04:46:24.230 --> 04:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
very much doctor next up we have William
 
04:46:24.240 --> 04:46:25.788 align:start position:0%
very much doctor next up we have William
Rogers

04:46:25.788 --> 04:46:25.798 align:start position:0%
Rogers
 
04:46:30.170 --> 04:46:30.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:32.030 --> 04:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
I can't talk for three minutes don't
 
04:46:32.040 --> 04:46:34.190 align:start position:0%
I can't talk for three minutes don't
worry

04:46:34.190 --> 04:46:34.200 align:start position:0%
worry
 
04:46:37.788 --> 04:46:37.798 align:start position:0%
thank you last as always welcome I am
 
04:46:40.070 --> 04:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
going to talk about vaccines I don't
 
04:46:41.750 --> 04:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
know a thing about them
 
04:46:45.050 --> 04:46:45.060 align:start position:0%
I know that we're as a country we're
 
04:46:47.810 --> 04:46:47.820 align:start position:0%
very divided if you would listen to the
 
04:46:49.910 --> 04:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
testimony of the people who want and I
 
04:46:51.470 --> 04:46:51.480 align:start position:0%
support this bill
 
04:46:53.810 --> 04:46:53.820 align:start position:0%
if you listen to the people who don't
 
04:46:55.850 --> 04:46:55.860 align:start position:0%
want to support the bill who don't agree
 
04:46:58.730 --> 04:46:58.740 align:start position:0%
with it you would it would seem like if
 
04:47:00.770 --> 04:47:00.780 align:start position:0%
we don't if we pass this bill we're
 
04:47:02.150 --> 04:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
going to go back to a third world
 
04:47:05.030 --> 04:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
country and every vaccine is going to be
 
04:47:07.070 --> 04:47:07.080 align:start position:0%
taken care of and it's going to be gloom
 
04:47:09.470 --> 04:47:09.480 align:start position:0%
and doom and if you listen to the people
 
04:47:11.930 --> 04:47:11.940 align:start position:0%
who do support it some of them make it
 
04:47:13.910 --> 04:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
seem like
 
04:47:17.390 --> 04:47:17.400 align:start position:0%
if like like the the way it is right now
 
04:47:19.190 --> 04:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
that they're gonna you know they're
 
04:47:21.110 --> 04:47:21.120 align:start position:0%
gonna jab us and we're all gonna become
 
04:47:23.868 --> 04:47:23.878 align:start position:0%
zombies I don't believe either one but I
 
04:47:25.730 --> 04:47:25.740 align:start position:0%
know it's been a rough three years it's
 
04:47:27.830 --> 04:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
been a rough couple of years and I know
 
04:47:30.110 --> 04:47:30.120 align:start position:0%
people don't trust the government
 
04:47:31.910 --> 04:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
they especially don't trust
 
04:47:31.920 --> 04:47:33.490 align:start position:0%
they especially don't trust
bureaucracies

04:47:33.490 --> 04:47:33.500 align:start position:0%
bureaucracies
 
04:47:38.208 --> 04:47:38.218 align:start position:0%
and I think that you have an opportunity
 
04:47:41.930 --> 04:47:41.940 align:start position:0%
to start to to mend that Rift because
 
04:47:44.390 --> 04:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
it's it's not that people don't want to
 
04:47:47.270 --> 04:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
trust people want to trust but we trust
 
04:47:50.690 --> 04:47:50.700 align:start position:0%
what I trust more is this right here I
 
04:47:52.550 --> 04:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
trust you I trust that you as a
 
04:47:55.150 --> 04:47:55.160 align:start position:0%
committee to take everything into
 
04:47:58.250 --> 04:47:58.260 align:start position:0%
consideration and make the best choice
 
04:48:02.288 --> 04:48:02.298 align:start position:0%
best vote on your conscience and I think
 
04:48:04.910 --> 04:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
putting this bill forward and having
 
04:48:07.250 --> 04:48:07.260 align:start position:0%
that same legislation
 
04:48:10.310 --> 04:48:10.320 align:start position:0%
doing the same thing is going to start
 
04:48:13.250 --> 04:48:13.260 align:start position:0%
to build trust back up in the government
 
04:48:16.128 --> 04:48:16.138 align:start position:0%
that we need to trust that's all
 
04:48:18.530 --> 04:48:18.540 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:48:20.990 --> 04:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
seeing no questions thank you can I help
 
04:48:23.090 --> 04:48:23.100 align:start position:0%
yes yes you can
 
04:48:26.690 --> 04:48:26.700 align:start position:0%
thank you next up we have um
 
04:48:28.368 --> 04:48:28.378 align:start position:0%
somebody from new Futures will need to
 
04:48:30.410 --> 04:48:30.420 align:start position:0%
put your name on this card as well
 
04:48:31.430 --> 04:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
um you've asked for three to five
 
04:48:32.930 --> 04:48:32.940 align:start position:0%
minutes for limiting people to three
 
04:48:32.940 --> 04:48:35.110 align:start position:0%
minutes for limiting people to three
minutes

04:48:35.110 --> 04:48:35.120 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
04:48:37.610 --> 04:48:37.620 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
04:48:40.070 --> 04:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
um it might be Kate Frey we do have
 
04:48:41.690 --> 04:48:41.700 align:start position:0%
submitted testimony and I guess if she's
 
04:48:42.770 --> 04:48:42.780 align:start position:0%
not in the room
 
04:48:48.948 --> 04:48:48.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:50.868 --> 04:48:50.878 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:48:52.670 --> 04:48:52.680 align:start position:0%
one minute we'd appreciate shorter than
 
04:49:00.590 --> 04:49:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:03.110 --> 04:49:03.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair my name is Thomas

McLeod I resided in Mount Vernon and
 
04:49:06.298 --> 04:49:07.610 align:start position:0%
McLeod I resided in Mount Vernon and
support

04:49:07.610 --> 04:49:07.620 align:start position:0%
support
 
04:49:11.150 --> 04:49:11.160 align:start position:0%
HP 557 I'll be brief
 
04:49:13.430 --> 04:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
and not take any questions I'm the chair
 
04:49:15.770 --> 04:49:15.780 align:start position:0%
of health room New Hampshire a Statewide
 
04:49:17.868 --> 04:49:17.878 align:start position:0%
advocacy organization
 
04:49:21.410 --> 04:49:21.420 align:start position:0%
with over 3 000 members
 
04:49:24.470 --> 04:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
um and supporters and the overwhelming
 
04:49:26.810 --> 04:49:26.820 align:start position:0%
sense of our members
 
04:49:30.890 --> 04:49:30.900 align:start position:0%
is That vaccine mandate decisions
 
04:49:33.708 --> 04:49:33.718 align:start position:0%
are made by agencies that are frankly uh
 
04:49:38.930 --> 04:49:38.940 align:start position:0%
beholden to Industry and to unelected
 
04:49:42.890 --> 04:49:42.900 align:start position:0%
Global Health agencies
 
04:49:46.730 --> 04:49:46.740 align:start position:0%
these are the same agencies that attempt
 
04:49:48.530 --> 04:49:48.540 align:start position:0%
to limit discussion
 
04:49:52.190 --> 04:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
by labeling those who disagree with them
 
04:49:54.890 --> 04:49:54.900 align:start position:0%
as spreaders of misinformation
 
04:49:57.670 --> 04:49:57.680 align:start position:0%
and to the concern about
 
04:50:01.128 --> 04:50:01.138 align:start position:0%
partisan conflict uh quite frankly this
 
04:50:02.930 --> 04:50:02.940 align:start position:0%
will happen
 
04:50:02.940 --> 04:50:03.708 align:start position:0%
will happen
um

04:50:03.708 --> 04:50:03.718 align:start position:0%
um

State Health Department the department
 
04:52:25.190 --> 04:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
current system
 
04:52:27.230 --> 04:52:27.240 align:start position:0%
protects the public health and provides
 
04:52:29.150 --> 04:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
a balanced choice for parents and
 
04:52:31.128 --> 04:52:31.138 align:start position:0%
individuals it allows for legislative

and public input to protect the health
 
04:52:36.550 --> 04:52:36.560 align:start position:0%
of all children the system is not broken
 
04:52:39.910 --> 04:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
the department carefully reviews
 
04:52:42.350 --> 04:52:42.360 align:start position:0%
childhood vaccines recommend
 
04:52:44.150 --> 04:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
recommendations and key criteria
 
04:52:46.448 --> 04:52:46.458 align:start position:0%
including vaccine efficacy

04:52:49.910 --> 04:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
disease
 
04:52:52.128 --> 04:52:52.138 align:start position:0%
likelihood of infection and method of
 
04:52:54.410 --> 04:52:54.420 align:start position:0%
transmission in order to determine which
 
04:52:56.570 --> 04:52:56.580 align:start position:0%
should be required for school and child
 
04:52:59.570 --> 04:52:59.580 align:start position:0%
care and child care entry
 
04:52:59.580 --> 04:53:01.788 align:start position:0%
care and child care entry
um

04:53:01.788 --> 04:53:01.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:04.550 --> 04:53:04.560 align:start position:0%
from hearing from from hearing the
 
04:53:07.550 --> 04:53:07.560 align:start position:0%
sponsor uh give an overview of
 
04:53:11.150 --> 04:53:11.160 align:start position:0%
um of the proposed bill it seems like
 
04:53:13.850 --> 04:53:13.860 align:start position:0%
the current system is not broken and
 
04:53:17.150 --> 04:53:17.160 align:start position:0%
it's very inclusive it offers
 
04:53:19.810 --> 04:53:19.820 align:start position:0%
legislative input it offers public input
 
04:53:23.208 --> 04:53:23.218 align:start position:0%
and and the proposed system or proposed
 
04:53:26.208 --> 04:53:26.218 align:start position:0%
structure it's more exclusive and it
 
04:53:29.750 --> 04:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
puts the burden on the legislators so uh
 
04:53:32.810 --> 04:53:32.820 align:start position:0%
that is a concern that there is no
 
04:53:35.690 --> 04:53:35.700 align:start position:0%
public input there is no involvement
 
04:53:37.550 --> 04:53:37.560 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Health and Human
 
04:53:37.560 --> 04:53:39.110 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Health and Human
Services

04:53:39.110 --> 04:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
Services
 
04:53:39.120 --> 04:53:41.030 align:start position:0%
Services
um

04:53:41.030 --> 04:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:53:42.650 --> 04:53:42.660 align:start position:0%
um which something that currently the
 
04:53:44.030 --> 04:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
04:53:48.470 --> 04:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
offers so therefore we see that house
 
04:53:51.770 --> 04:53:51.780 align:start position:0%
bill 557 furthers uh it furthers no
 
04:53:54.170 --> 04:53:54.180 align:start position:0%
valid Public Health policy and we would
 
04:53:58.670 --> 04:53:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:00.530 --> 04:54:00.540 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and just for your
 
04:54:00.540 --> 04:54:01.850 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and just for your
clarification

04:54:01.850 --> 04:54:01.860 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
04:54:03.470 --> 04:54:03.480 align:start position:0%
um any changes in the future would need
 
04:54:05.628 --> 04:54:05.638 align:start position:0%
a process oh sorry that was mine just
 
04:54:08.090 --> 04:54:08.100 align:start position:0%
like this so if there were any future
 
04:54:10.128 --> 04:54:10.138 align:start position:0%
changes we'd be back in this room with a
 
04:54:12.590 --> 04:54:12.600 align:start position:0%
much larger crowd I'm sure are there any
 
04:54:12.600 --> 04:54:14.208 align:start position:0%
much larger crowd I'm sure are there any
questions

04:54:14.208 --> 04:54:14.218 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:54:17.510 --> 04:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
now say no more thank you very much next

04:54:23.628 --> 04:54:23.638 align:start position:0%
I'll set the timer for three minutes but
 
04:54:35.270 --> 04:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:37.550 --> 04:54:37.560 align:start position:0%

04:54:48.708 --> 04:54:48.718 align:start position:0%
text of Article 2 in the New Hampshire
 
04:54:51.708 --> 04:54:51.718 align:start position:0%
Constitution it says how the legislature
 
04:54:54.770 --> 04:54:54.780 align:start position:0%
is constituted the Supreme legislature
 
04:54:56.810 --> 04:54:56.820 align:start position:0%

Representatives Each of which shall have
 
04:55:02.510 --> 04:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
a negative on the other
 
04:55:08.090 --> 04:55:08.100 align:start position:0%
rules are not laws DHS DHHS JL Carr
 
04:55:10.490 --> 04:55:10.500 align:start position:0%
never had this authority to begin with
 
04:55:14.150 --> 04:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
this is what our job is the legislature
 
04:55:16.190 --> 04:55:16.200 align:start position:0%
the people of New Hampshire did not
 
04:55:19.190 --> 04:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
elect DHHS the people of New Hampshire
 
04:55:22.128 --> 04:55:22.138 align:start position:0%
did not give the authority to a subset
 
04:55:25.788 --> 04:55:25.798 align:start position:0%
of the legislature which is JL Carr
 
04:55:28.250 --> 04:55:28.260 align:start position:0%
basically politicians are the ones that
 
04:55:31.368 --> 04:55:31.378 align:start position:0%
set policy not
 
04:55:35.750 --> 04:55:35.760 align:start position:0%

04:55:46.490 --> 04:55:46.500 align:start position:0%
you're up if you have copies of your
 
04:55:48.170 --> 04:55:48.180 align:start position:0%
testimony um otherwise we'll take the
 
04:55:49.430 --> 04:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
one copy for the record if you don't
 
04:55:51.410 --> 04:55:51.420 align:start position:0%
mind and press the button so it's read
 
04:55:53.090 --> 04:55:53.100 align:start position:0%
up here okay she didn't know she turned
 
04:55:54.110 --> 04:55:54.120 align:start position:0%
it off
 
04:55:57.788 --> 04:55:57.798 align:start position:0%
um I'm here as a parent of two children
 
04:56:02.208 --> 04:56:02.218 align:start position:0%
that have chronic illnesses so I'm here
 
04:56:05.770 --> 04:56:05.780 align:start position:0%
to support this uh Bill mainly because
 
04:56:08.150 --> 04:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
both of them have been injured by
 
04:56:11.510 --> 04:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
vaccines that were required and
 
04:56:14.448 --> 04:56:14.458 align:start position:0%
um there is no recourse one of my
 
04:56:16.670 --> 04:56:16.680 align:start position:0%
children has traumatic brain injury from
 
04:56:20.030 --> 04:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
That vaccine and she will never be able
 
04:56:22.788 --> 04:56:22.798 align:start position:0%
to fully realize the career that she
 
04:56:25.490 --> 04:56:25.500 align:start position:0%
wanted to to do because of her vaccine
 
04:56:25.500 --> 04:56:26.868 align:start position:0%
wanted to to do because of her vaccine
injury

04:56:26.868 --> 04:56:26.878 align:start position:0%
injury
 
04:56:30.170 --> 04:56:30.180 align:start position:0%
there is no recourse for her or myself
 
04:56:32.150 --> 04:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
or anyone else that gets injured by
 
04:56:33.650 --> 04:56:33.660 align:start position:0%
these vaccines
 
04:56:37.128 --> 04:56:37.138 align:start position:0%
and to sit there and keep adding more
 
04:56:40.628 --> 04:56:40.638 align:start position:0%
and more we are now at
 
04:56:44.448 --> 04:56:44.458 align:start position:0%
32 to almost 40 shots
 
04:56:46.730 --> 04:56:46.740 align:start position:0%
when you think about each vaccine there
 
04:56:50.330 --> 04:56:50.340 align:start position:0%
are two to three if not four doses of
 
04:56:52.670 --> 04:56:52.680 align:start position:0%
each of those vaccines so we're up to 40
 
04:56:55.850 --> 04:56:55.860 align:start position:0%
Shots by a time a child is about 17 18
 
04:56:57.288 --> 04:56:57.298 align:start position:0%
years of age
 
04:56:59.090 --> 04:56:59.100 align:start position:0%
and there are more on top of that and
 
04:57:01.788 --> 04:57:01.798 align:start position:0%
that's not including the flu vaccine or
 
04:57:03.650 --> 04:57:03.660 align:start position:0%
whatever they do with covid
 
04:57:06.230 --> 04:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
and you say oh yeah go to your doctor or
 
04:57:08.868 --> 04:57:08.878 align:start position:0%
go get you know exemptions for this well
 
04:57:10.310 --> 04:57:10.320 align:start position:0%
since covid
 
04:57:13.128 --> 04:57:13.138 align:start position:0%
I cannot get a doctor to exempt my child
 
04:57:17.510 --> 04:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
medically and some places do not accept
 
04:57:20.390 --> 04:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
the religious exemption especially when
 
04:57:22.970 --> 04:57:22.980 align:start position:0%
you try to go to places outside of the
 
04:57:24.590 --> 04:57:24.600 align:start position:0%
state because there are New England
 
04:57:27.170 --> 04:57:27.180 align:start position:0%
states that are no longer allowing the
 
04:57:29.990 --> 04:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
religious exemption so then my child is
 
04:57:30.000 --> 04:57:31.070 align:start position:0%
religious exemption so then my child is
stuck

04:57:31.070 --> 04:57:31.080 align:start position:0%
stuck
 
04:57:33.230 --> 04:57:33.240 align:start position:0%
and then you have to decide does she
 
04:57:35.750 --> 04:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
want to take this vaccine to go and have
 
04:57:38.150 --> 04:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
this other opportunity and risk having
 
04:57:41.208 --> 04:57:41.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:45.050 --> 04:57:45.060 align:start position:0%
and again no recourse to what she can or
 
04:57:47.270 --> 04:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
can't do against anyone that made this
 
04:57:47.280 --> 04:57:49.190 align:start position:0%
can't do against anyone that made this
vaccine

04:57:49.190 --> 04:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
04:57:49.200 --> 04:57:50.628 align:start position:0%
vaccine
um

04:57:50.628 --> 04:57:50.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:57:52.430 --> 04:57:52.440 align:start position:0%
this burden needs to be on the
 
04:57:54.590 --> 04:57:54.600 align:start position:0%
legislature we elected you to take on
 
04:57:56.750 --> 04:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
this burden this is your job
 
04:58:00.470 --> 04:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
this is not the job of a few people that
 
04:58:02.990 --> 04:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
were placed there and are very much
 
04:58:05.150 --> 04:58:05.160 align:start position:0%
affected by whatever big Pharma and
 
04:58:06.948 --> 04:58:06.958 align:start position:0%
whatever lobbyists are sitting there and
 
04:58:09.288 --> 04:58:09.298 align:start position:0%
in their ear all day long because we
 
04:58:11.208 --> 04:58:11.218 align:start position:0%
don't have access to them we have access
 
04:58:14.448 --> 04:58:14.458 align:start position:0%
to you we don't have access to them
 
04:58:19.128 --> 04:58:19.138 align:start position:0%
and um as far as you know what is
 
04:58:21.170 --> 04:58:21.180 align:start position:0%
available and going to be brought at
 
04:58:23.690 --> 04:58:23.700 align:start position:0%
school and whatnot I was a teacher for
 
04:58:25.550 --> 04:58:25.560 align:start position:0%
12 years you know that risk going in
 
04:58:27.110 --> 04:58:27.120 align:start position:0%
there I was pregnant
 
04:58:29.810 --> 04:58:29.820 align:start position:0%
twice what I was teaching
 
04:58:32.090 --> 04:58:32.100 align:start position:0%
you know fifth disease there is no
 
04:58:34.368 --> 04:58:34.378 align:start position:0%
vaccine for that that is one of the most
 
04:58:36.288 --> 04:58:36.298 align:start position:0%
harmful diseases that will happen to a
 
04:58:37.788 --> 04:58:37.798 align:start position:0%
pregnant woman if they come and contact
 
04:58:40.070 --> 04:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
it I knew that as a teacher going and I
 
04:58:41.570 --> 04:58:41.580 align:start position:0%
took that risk
 
04:58:42.770 --> 04:58:42.780 align:start position:0%
but I'm not going to sit there and
 
04:58:44.990 --> 04:58:45.000 align:start position:0%
mandate a child has to have a vaccine if
 
04:58:47.628 --> 04:58:47.638 align:start position:0%
they're going to get injured by it
 
04:58:50.270 --> 04:58:50.280 align:start position:0%
finally what we need to start realizing
 
04:58:53.150 --> 04:58:53.160 align:start position:0%
in the medical field is just because we
 
04:58:56.510 --> 04:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
can do this doesn't mean we should
 
04:58:59.150 --> 04:58:59.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:59:02.090 --> 04:59:02.100 align:start position:0%
thank you and perfect timing that was
 
04:59:03.890 --> 04:59:03.900 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:59:13.970 --> 04:59:13.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:16.070 --> 04:59:16.080 align:start position:0%
hi everyone thank you for being here
 
04:59:16.080 --> 04:59:16.910 align:start position:0%
hi everyone thank you for being here
today

04:59:16.910 --> 04:59:16.920 align:start position:0%
today
 
04:59:19.368 --> 04:59:19.378 align:start position:0%
um I just I know you've
 
04:59:21.830 --> 04:59:21.840 align:start position:0%
heard a lot of great testimony but um I
 
04:59:24.830 --> 04:59:24.840 align:start position:0%
just want to acknowledge the um
 
04:59:26.810 --> 04:59:26.820 align:start position:0%
the great number of lobbyists that are
 
04:59:28.670 --> 04:59:28.680 align:start position:0%
here today and the very few number of
 
04:59:28.680 --> 04:59:30.708 align:start position:0%
here today and the very few number of
parents

04:59:30.708 --> 04:59:30.718 align:start position:0%
parents
 
04:59:32.868 --> 04:59:32.878 align:start position:0%
um and the lobbyists are paid to be here
 
04:59:36.590 --> 04:59:36.600 align:start position:0%
and I took the day off to be here and I
 
04:59:38.810 --> 04:59:38.820 align:start position:0%
have a lot of friends who
 
04:59:41.390 --> 04:59:41.400 align:start position:0%
could not take the day off either from
 
04:59:43.670 --> 04:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
their jobs or being parents to be here
 
04:59:46.430 --> 04:59:46.440 align:start position:0%
so I just want to make sure that um
 
04:59:48.948 --> 04:59:48.958 align:start position:0%
Everybody reads the testimonies that are
 
04:59:51.050 --> 04:59:51.060 align:start position:0%
coming in via email because it's really
 
04:59:53.448 --> 04:59:53.458 align:start position:0%
important that you hear us like there
 
04:59:56.510 --> 04:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
appeared to be they're getting paid we
 
04:59:57.830 --> 04:59:57.840 align:start position:0%
just have to live with whatever you
 
05:00:00.350 --> 05:00:00.360 align:start position:0%
decide so thank you
 
05:00:02.050 --> 05:00:02.060 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:00:04.550 --> 05:00:04.560 align:start position:0%
next we have the honorable Melissa
 
05:00:04.560 --> 05:00:11.930 align:start position:0%
next we have the honorable Melissa
blazak

05:00:11.930 --> 05:00:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:14.270 --> 05:00:14.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
05:00:16.010 --> 05:00:16.020 align:start position:0%
committee uh
 
05:00:18.350 --> 05:00:18.360 align:start position:0%
my name is Melissa blasik of Merrimack
 
05:00:20.690 --> 05:00:20.700 align:start position:0%
I'm here representing rebuild New
 
05:00:23.510 --> 05:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we do support this bill
 
05:00:24.890 --> 05:00:24.900 align:start position:0%
um just after hearing some of the other
 
05:00:26.390 --> 05:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
testimony I want to say I don't think
 
05:00:29.510 --> 05:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
that this is really a vaccine bill I
 
05:00:31.128 --> 05:00:31.138 align:start position:0%
don't it doesn't argue the Merit of
 
05:00:34.310 --> 05:00:34.320 align:start position:0%
vaccination the purpose of rules is to
 
05:00:36.708 --> 05:00:36.718 align:start position:0%
technically enact the details of policy
 
05:00:39.948 --> 05:00:39.958 align:start position:0%
set forth by politicians and this makes
 
05:00:41.810 --> 05:00:41.820 align:start position:0%
sense politicians should be the only
 
05:00:44.510 --> 05:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
people to set policy since they unlike
 
05:00:46.250 --> 05:00:46.260 align:start position:0%
administrators are accountable to the
 
05:00:46.260 --> 05:00:47.270 align:start position:0%
administrators are accountable to the
voters

05:00:47.270 --> 05:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
voters
 
05:00:49.190 --> 05:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
adding a vaccine to the school schedule
 
05:00:52.368 --> 05:00:52.378 align:start position:0%
is absolutely a policy decision and I
 
05:00:53.930 --> 05:00:53.940 align:start position:0%
believe it has no place in the rule
 
05:00:55.490 --> 05:00:55.500 align:start position:0%
making process
 
05:00:58.128 --> 05:00:58.138 align:start position:0%
this shouldn't be a partisan issue in my
 
05:01:00.170 --> 05:01:00.180 align:start position:0%
mind it is simply making sure that all
 
05:01:02.448 --> 05:01:02.458 align:start position:0%
policy is set by politicians who are
 
05:01:02.458 --> 05:01:03.890 align:start position:0%
policy is set by politicians who are
accountable

05:01:03.890 --> 05:01:03.900 align:start position:0%
accountable
 
05:01:05.930 --> 05:01:05.940 align:start position:0%
legislative seasons are fairly short in
 
05:01:07.310 --> 05:01:07.320 align:start position:0%
almost every state and I believe our
 
05:01:09.288 --> 05:01:09.298 align:start position:0%
Founders limited the time available to
 
05:01:11.990 --> 05:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
legislate to limit the size and scope of
 
05:01:13.430 --> 05:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
government and having a small government
 
05:01:15.410 --> 05:01:15.420 align:start position:0%
is something that many people in New
 
05:01:17.150 --> 05:01:17.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are very proud of but when New
 
05:01:18.650 --> 05:01:18.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was founded we did not have
 
05:01:20.510 --> 05:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
the type of administrative state that we
 
05:01:22.490 --> 05:01:22.500 align:start position:0%
have now who work year-round
 
05:01:24.110 --> 05:01:24.120 align:start position:0%
and I understand that one of the reasons
 
05:01:25.910 --> 05:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
why we have come to rely so heavily on
 
05:01:27.230 --> 05:01:27.240 align:start position:0%
the administrative state is because
 
05:01:29.448 --> 05:01:29.458 align:start position:0%
rules can be adopted in a faster process
 
05:01:31.670 --> 05:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
however the legislature does have
 
05:01:33.288 --> 05:01:33.298 align:start position:0%
emergency Powers built into the
 
05:01:35.208 --> 05:01:35.218 align:start position:0%
constitution in form in the form of
 
05:01:37.190 --> 05:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
special sessions this is what our
 
05:01:38.750 --> 05:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
Founders Envision should an emergency
 
05:01:41.270 --> 05:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
arise necessitating emergency action
 
05:01:44.510 --> 05:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
however there is no history of such an
 
05:01:46.128 --> 05:01:46.138 align:start position:0%
emergency appearing that required a
 
05:01:47.810 --> 05:01:47.820 align:start position:0%
vaccine to be quickly added to the
 
05:01:49.368 --> 05:01:49.378 align:start position:0%
school schedule so I find the likelihood
 
05:01:51.770 --> 05:01:51.780 align:start position:0%
of this scenario very slim
 
05:01:53.868 --> 05:01:53.878 align:start position:0%
we've seen other versions of this bill
 
05:01:55.910 --> 05:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
in the past but as we all know sometimes
 
05:01:58.788 --> 05:01:58.798 align:start position:0%
it takes time to find the best solution
 
05:02:01.128 --> 05:02:01.138 align:start position:0%
to a problem and I believe that this
 
05:02:03.110 --> 05:02:03.120 align:start position:0%
bill is the correct solution and I hope
 
05:02:04.490 --> 05:02:04.500 align:start position:0%
that the committee willfully support
 
05:02:06.530 --> 05:02:06.540 align:start position:0%
this Bill thank you
 
05:02:08.208 --> 05:02:08.218 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the testimony
 
05:02:11.050 --> 05:02:11.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:13.910 --> 05:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
that's all right thank you very much
 
05:02:15.410 --> 05:02:15.420 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to check and see if the
 
05:02:17.030 --> 05:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
representative from new Futures was back
 
05:02:19.250 --> 05:02:19.260 align:start position:0%
in the room
 
05:02:21.530 --> 05:02:21.540 align:start position:0%
and uh then just before I close this
 
05:02:22.970 --> 05:02:22.980 align:start position:0%
hearing I'll just remind everybody no
 
05:02:26.270 --> 05:02:26.280 align:start position:0%
clapping booing waves anything like that
 
05:02:28.070 --> 05:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much and I'll hand the
 
05:02:36.350 --> 05:02:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:38.390 --> 05:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
oh thank you
 
05:02:40.970 --> 05:02:40.980 align:start position:0%
um okay so there's no one else saying no
 
05:02:44.270 --> 05:02:44.280 align:start position:0%
one else to testify on HP 557 I think
 
05:02:45.470 --> 05:02:45.480 align:start position:0%
you already did that right I'm sorry
 
05:02:47.208 --> 05:02:47.218 align:start position:0%
gotta get back in the swing of things
 
05:02:49.730 --> 05:02:49.740 align:start position:0%
now uh I'm not I am now going to open
 
05:02:53.090 --> 05:02:53.100 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on HB 408 and once
 
05:02:55.310 --> 05:02:55.320 align:start position:0%
again recognize our very own Committee
 
05:02:57.830 --> 05:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
Member representative Jim cofult for the
 
05:03:07.970 --> 05:03:07.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:10.070 --> 05:03:10.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
05:03:11.448 --> 05:03:11.458 align:start position:0%
committee I promise this is the last
 
05:03:12.650 --> 05:03:12.660 align:start position:0%
time I'm going to be sitting down here
 
05:03:15.708 --> 05:03:15.718 align:start position:0%
and you have to listen to me today
 
05:03:15.718 --> 05:03:17.150 align:start position:0%
and you have to listen to me today
um

05:03:17.150 --> 05:03:17.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:03:20.570 --> 05:03:20.580 align:start position:0%
so House Bill 408 is kind of a
 
05:03:22.850 --> 05:03:22.860 align:start position:0%
complicated situation
 
05:03:25.368 --> 05:03:25.378 align:start position:0%
um it is illustrative of what can happen
 
05:03:28.610 --> 05:03:28.620 align:start position:0%
however with administrative rule when
 
05:03:28.620 --> 05:03:29.390 align:start position:0%
however with administrative rule when
um

05:03:29.390 --> 05:03:29.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:03:33.310 --> 05:03:33.320 align:start position:0%
when we delegate lawmaking Authority
 
05:03:36.948 --> 05:03:36.958 align:start position:0%
uh outside of the legislature and when
 
05:03:38.930 --> 05:03:38.940 align:start position:0%
uh the the people who make
 
05:03:40.730 --> 05:03:40.740 align:start position:0%
administrative rules turn around and
 
05:03:43.190 --> 05:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
delegate or defer
 
05:03:45.350 --> 05:03:45.360 align:start position:0%
to an outside party in this case to the
 
05:03:48.050 --> 05:03:48.060 align:start position:0%
CDC and asip and others
 
05:03:48.060 --> 05:03:49.150 align:start position:0%
CDC and asip and others
um

05:03:49.150 --> 05:03:49.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:03:51.890 --> 05:03:51.900 align:start position:0%
so essentially here here's here's what
 
05:03:55.390 --> 05:03:55.400 align:start position:0%
happened in how we got here um RSA 170e
 
05:04:00.310 --> 05:04:00.320 align:start position:0%
section 34 addresses requirements for
 
05:04:04.368 --> 05:04:04.378 align:start position:0%
foster care homes among other things
 
05:04:06.590 --> 05:04:06.600 align:start position:0%
and there's a section of that that
 
05:04:09.830 --> 05:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
states that for in of that of the rules
 
05:04:11.330 --> 05:04:11.340 align:start position:0%
um sorry not of the statute but of the
 
05:04:14.448 --> 05:04:14.458 align:start position:0%
rules authorized by the statute it says
 
05:04:17.330 --> 05:04:17.340 align:start position:0%
or any foster parent seeking to provide
 
05:04:20.628 --> 05:04:20.638 align:start position:0%
care to a child under six years old or a
 
05:04:23.030 --> 05:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
child with special medical needs
 
05:04:25.128 --> 05:04:25.138 align:start position:0%
all children who are household members
 
05:04:27.470 --> 05:04:27.480 align:start position:0%
shall be up to date on immunizations
 
05:04:29.750 --> 05:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
consistent with the recommendations of
 
05:04:32.510 --> 05:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
the American Academy of Pediatrics the
 
05:04:34.070 --> 05:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
advisory committee on immunization
 
05:04:36.830 --> 05:04:36.840 align:start position:0%
practices that's asip of the Center for
 
05:04:40.070 --> 05:04:40.080 align:start position:0%
Disease Control and prevention and the
 
05:04:41.930 --> 05:04:41.940 align:start position:0%
American Academy of family physicians
 
05:04:44.390 --> 05:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
unless the immunization is contrary to
 
05:04:46.670 --> 05:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
the child's health as documented by a
 
05:04:49.190 --> 05:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
licensed health care professional
 
05:04:49.200 --> 05:04:50.510 align:start position:0%
licensed health care professional
so

05:04:50.510 --> 05:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:04:52.430 --> 05:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
what are the implications of this well
 
05:04:54.970 --> 05:04:54.980 align:start position:0%
as we noted earlier
 
05:04:57.288 --> 05:04:57.298 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire only mandates
 
05:05:00.190 --> 05:05:00.200 align:start position:0%
a subset of asip recommended vaccines
 
05:05:04.010 --> 05:05:04.020 align:start position:0%
for all children living in the state
 
05:05:07.250 --> 05:05:07.260 align:start position:0%
this rule however mandates all asip
 
05:05:09.288 --> 05:05:09.298 align:start position:0%
recommended vaccines for certain
 
05:05:10.788 --> 05:05:10.798 align:start position:0%
children in the state
 
05:05:12.288 --> 05:05:12.298 align:start position:0%
which children
 
05:05:15.530 --> 05:05:15.540 align:start position:0%
I want to point out that the the name of
 
05:05:17.448 --> 05:05:17.458 align:start position:0%
the bill is actually
 
05:05:19.970 --> 05:05:19.980 align:start position:0%
slightly misleading probably needs to be
 
05:05:23.030 --> 05:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
corrected it says relative to foster
 
05:05:25.128 --> 05:05:25.138 align:start position:0%
children and vaccinations this actually
 
05:05:27.948 --> 05:05:27.958 align:start position:0%
does not affect foster children it
 
05:05:30.170 --> 05:05:30.180 align:start position:0%
affects other children living in a
 
05:05:32.690 --> 05:05:32.700 align:start position:0%
foster home in other words adopted or
 
05:05:35.570 --> 05:05:35.580 align:start position:0%
natural born children or even children
 
05:05:36.970 --> 05:05:36.980 align:start position:0%
who are
 
05:05:39.830 --> 05:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
long-term guests perhaps in a foster
 
05:05:44.270 --> 05:05:44.280 align:start position:0%
care home are subject to this mandate
 
05:05:44.280 --> 05:05:45.310 align:start position:0%
care home are subject to this mandate
um

05:05:45.310 --> 05:05:45.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:48.050 --> 05:05:48.060 align:start position:0%
the foster children themselves are not
 
05:05:49.730 --> 05:05:49.740 align:start position:0%
subject to the Mandate because of a bill
 
05:05:52.670 --> 05:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
we passed in the previous biennium that
 
05:05:54.948 --> 05:05:54.958 align:start position:0%
exempts anyone essentially says you you
 
05:05:58.550 --> 05:05:58.560 align:start position:0%
are not subject to a covid-19 mandate in
 
05:06:00.770 --> 05:06:00.780 align:start position:0%
uh as a condition for receiving a
 
05:06:02.690 --> 05:06:02.700 align:start position:0%
benefit from the state so I would
 
05:06:04.128 --> 05:06:04.138 align:start position:0%
actually correct what I just said they
 
05:06:05.868 --> 05:06:05.878 align:start position:0%
may be subject to
 
05:06:08.990 --> 05:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
the entire asip recommended list minus
 
05:06:11.868 --> 05:06:11.878 align:start position:0%
the covid-19 vaccine
 
05:06:15.288 --> 05:06:15.298 align:start position:0%
um so so it gets into a rather sort of
 
05:06:18.230 --> 05:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
complicated and difficult situation
 
05:06:20.990 --> 05:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
um in which we're mandating the entire
 
05:06:24.650 --> 05:06:24.660 align:start position:0%
asip recommended list for very specific
 
05:06:28.070 --> 05:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
a very specific group of children and we
 
05:06:30.050 --> 05:06:30.060 align:start position:0%
are not allowing them the same due
 
05:06:32.510 --> 05:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
process that other children in the state
 
05:06:34.490 --> 05:06:34.500 align:start position:0%
have because they do not have a right to
 
05:06:37.730 --> 05:06:37.740 align:start position:0%
a religious exemption okay so under this
 
05:06:39.770 --> 05:06:39.780 align:start position:0%
it's it says unless the immunization is
 
05:06:41.868 --> 05:06:41.878 align:start position:0%
contrary to the child's health as
 
05:06:43.670 --> 05:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
documented by a licensed Healthcare
 
05:06:46.610 --> 05:06:46.620 align:start position:0%
professional so there is nothing here
 
05:06:46.620 --> 05:06:48.530 align:start position:0%
professional so there is nothing here
that

05:06:48.530 --> 05:06:48.540 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:06:52.190 --> 05:06:52.200 align:start position:0%
um that exempts them from mandatory
 
05:06:55.788 --> 05:06:55.798 align:start position:0%
vaccination outside of uh outside of a
 
05:06:58.190 --> 05:06:58.200 align:start position:0%
medical exemption so that's another
 
05:07:01.970 --> 05:07:01.980 align:start position:0%
concern with this bill
 
05:07:01.980 --> 05:07:02.750 align:start position:0%
concern with this bill
um

05:07:02.750 --> 05:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:07:06.050 --> 05:07:06.060 align:start position:0%
so you know I already spoke earlier to
 
05:07:08.448 --> 05:07:08.458 align:start position:0%
my concerns about the fact that the CDC
 
05:07:10.788 --> 05:07:10.798 align:start position:0%
is now putting vaccines on the
 
05:07:12.470 --> 05:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
recommended list not because they are
 
05:07:14.868 --> 05:07:14.878 align:start position:0%
recommended but because they can get
 
05:07:17.628 --> 05:07:17.638 align:start position:0%
them paid for by doing that so
 
05:07:20.270 --> 05:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
um you know I I think there there is a
 
05:07:20.280 --> 05:07:21.590 align:start position:0%
um you know I I think there there is a
um

05:07:21.590 --> 05:07:21.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:07:23.930 --> 05:07:23.940 align:start position:0%
a change in practices or a change in
 
05:07:26.470 --> 05:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
philosophy at the CDC
 
05:07:29.330 --> 05:07:29.340 align:start position:0%
that directly impacts a population of
 
05:07:32.570 --> 05:07:32.580 align:start position:0%
children in the United States now their
 
05:07:36.410 --> 05:07:36.420 align:start position:0%
to their credit I think DHHS has issued
 
05:07:40.250 --> 05:07:40.260 align:start position:0%
an emergency rule back in November in
 
05:07:42.430 --> 05:07:42.440 align:start position:0%
response to this and the emergency rule
 
05:07:44.448 --> 05:07:44.458 align:start position:0%
states that
 
05:07:46.670 --> 05:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
um and I was I apologize because I was
 
05:07:48.350 --> 05:07:48.360 align:start position:0%
trying to look it up and I I've lost
 
05:07:49.850 --> 05:07:49.860 align:start position:0%
track of it here but the the emergency
 
05:07:53.208 --> 05:07:53.218 align:start position:0%
rule essentially states that
 
05:07:55.788 --> 05:07:55.798 align:start position:0%
um the the covid-19
 
05:07:59.208 --> 05:07:59.218 align:start position:0%
uh mandate or the covid-19 vaccine will
 
05:08:02.750 --> 05:08:02.760 align:start position:0%
will be excluded from this list in other
 
05:08:05.628 --> 05:08:05.638 align:start position:0%
words the the children who would be
 
05:08:07.550 --> 05:08:07.560 align:start position:0%
affected under this are not required to
 
05:08:10.310 --> 05:08:10.320 align:start position:0%
take the covid-19 vaccine and the reason
 
05:08:12.288 --> 05:08:12.298 align:start position:0%
cited was that there is widespread
 
05:08:13.970 --> 05:08:13.980 align:start position:0%
public concern about the covid-19
 
05:08:16.070 --> 05:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
vaccine and that this would be
 
05:08:17.690 --> 05:08:17.700 align:start position:0%
detrimental to the Foster Care Program
 
05:08:19.788 --> 05:08:19.798 align:start position:0%
because there are a lot of people who do
 
05:08:21.530 --> 05:08:21.540 align:start position:0%
not want to subject their children to
 
05:08:24.590 --> 05:08:24.600 align:start position:0%
the covid-19 vaccine as a condition for
 
05:08:29.208 --> 05:08:29.218 align:start position:0%
being foster care parents so
 
05:08:31.490 --> 05:08:31.500 align:start position:0%
you know I think that there is a a
 
05:08:34.128 --> 05:08:34.138 align:start position:0%
broader concern here about
 
05:08:36.590 --> 05:08:36.600 align:start position:0%
um the fact that we are nevertheless
 
05:08:40.128 --> 05:08:40.138 align:start position:0%
mandating the rest of the list of
 
05:08:44.930 --> 05:08:44.940 align:start position:0%
um of asip recommended vaccines without
 
05:08:47.330 --> 05:08:47.340 align:start position:0%
um you know without an explicit reason
 
05:08:49.490 --> 05:08:49.500 align:start position:0%
to do so
 
05:08:49.500 --> 05:08:52.368 align:start position:0%
to do so
um

05:08:52.368 --> 05:08:52.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:55.670 --> 05:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
I guess I I also wanted to
 
05:08:55.680 --> 05:08:56.690 align:start position:0%
I guess I I also wanted to
um

05:08:56.690 --> 05:08:56.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:58.628 --> 05:08:58.638 align:start position:0%
point out that the emergency
 
05:09:03.050 --> 05:09:03.060 align:start position:0%
rule is in effect I believe for 120 days
 
05:09:05.868 --> 05:09:05.878 align:start position:0%
presumably it can be renewed I have to
 
05:09:07.570 --> 05:09:07.580 align:start position:0%
confess I am not
 
05:09:10.128 --> 05:09:10.138 align:start position:0%
so familiar with that that I would would
 
05:09:11.868 --> 05:09:11.878 align:start position:0%
be able to tell you definitively whether
 
05:09:14.330 --> 05:09:14.340 align:start position:0%
it could be renewed but
 
05:09:15.890 --> 05:09:15.900 align:start position:0%
um I do have
 
05:09:15.900 --> 05:09:16.610 align:start position:0%
um I do have
um

05:09:16.610 --> 05:09:16.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:09:18.890 --> 05:09:18.900 align:start position:0%
I I do have some concerns about the fact
 
05:09:21.890 --> 05:09:21.900 align:start position:0%
that that is just a uh at this point a
 
05:09:23.990 --> 05:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
temporary change
 
05:09:26.150 --> 05:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
um what this bill would do is to
 
05:09:30.470 --> 05:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
essentially say that there is no
 
05:09:33.708 --> 05:09:33.718 align:start position:0%
vaccination requirement for the affected
 
05:09:34.910 --> 05:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
children that I've just in the group
 
05:09:37.430 --> 05:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
that I've described that goes beyond
 
05:09:39.288 --> 05:09:39.298 align:start position:0%
what is required for any other child in
 
05:09:42.770 --> 05:09:42.780 align:start position:0%
the state I do want to let you know that
 
05:09:46.368 --> 05:09:46.378 align:start position:0%
I have asked OLS to provide to to draft
 
05:09:47.770 --> 05:09:47.780 align:start position:0%
an amendment
 
05:09:51.530 --> 05:09:51.540 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately that amendment was not
 
05:09:53.208 --> 05:09:53.218 align:start position:0%
ready as of the beginning of this
 
05:09:56.030 --> 05:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
hearing I will get it to the committee
 
05:09:59.750 --> 05:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
as soon as possible I would say that it
 
05:09:59.760 --> 05:10:01.070 align:start position:0%
as soon as possible I would say that it
it is

05:10:01.070 --> 05:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
it is
 
05:10:04.128 --> 05:10:04.138 align:start position:0%
it is substantively the same which is
 
05:10:06.890 --> 05:10:06.900 align:start position:0%
the intended effect of that language is
 
05:10:09.948 --> 05:10:09.958 align:start position:0%
to ensure that children who would
 
05:10:11.690 --> 05:10:11.700 align:start position:0%
currently be affected by this mandate
 
05:10:13.910 --> 05:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
will not be subjected to additional
 
05:10:16.368 --> 05:10:16.378 align:start position:0%
immunization requirements I would say
 
05:10:18.110 --> 05:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
that the the phrasing of that language
 
05:10:20.930 --> 05:10:20.940 align:start position:0%
is different it was called it was
 
05:10:24.070 --> 05:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
brought to my attention that the the the
 
05:10:26.270 --> 05:10:26.280 align:start position:0%
statute that that
 
05:10:28.970 --> 05:10:28.980 align:start position:0%
under which these rules were written may
 
05:10:31.510 --> 05:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
not actually authorize
 
05:10:34.610 --> 05:10:34.620 align:start position:0%
DHHS to impose vaccination requirements
 
05:10:36.670 --> 05:10:36.680 align:start position:0%
on Foster family homes
 
05:10:40.788 --> 05:10:40.798 align:start position:0%
and that as written this might imply
 
05:10:42.530 --> 05:10:42.540 align:start position:0%
that they do
 
05:10:45.890 --> 05:10:45.900 align:start position:0%
therefore I have asked for some new
 
05:10:47.750 --> 05:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
language that would just very clearly
 
05:10:49.610 --> 05:10:49.620 align:start position:0%
state that there shall not be any
 
05:10:52.070 --> 05:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
vaccination requirements for uh for
 
05:10:55.010 --> 05:10:55.020 align:start position:0%
imposed on Foster Homes outside of those
 
05:10:57.650 --> 05:10:57.660 align:start position:0%
which are already imposed on the the
 
05:10:59.690 --> 05:10:59.700 align:start position:0%
population at large and that all
 
05:11:01.788 --> 05:11:01.798 align:start position:0%
exemptions that are available to the
 
05:11:04.690 --> 05:11:04.700 align:start position:0%
population at large also be available to
 
05:11:07.788 --> 05:11:07.798 align:start position:0%
to people living in foster family
 
05:11:07.798 --> 05:11:09.948 align:start position:0%
to people living in foster family
households

05:11:09.948 --> 05:11:09.958 align:start position:0%
households
 
05:11:12.650 --> 05:11:12.660 align:start position:0%
with that I'm finished with my testimony
 
05:11:14.628 --> 05:11:14.638 align:start position:0%
and I will take questions thank you

05:11:18.730 --> 05:11:18.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:21.590 --> 05:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
thank you and so for clarification what
 
05:11:25.070 --> 05:11:25.080 align:start position:0%
we're really looking at here is not the
 
05:11:27.410 --> 05:11:27.420 align:start position:0%
foster children but the choices of the
 
05:11:31.010 --> 05:11:31.020 align:start position:0%
parents who are foster parents for those
 
05:11:33.170 --> 05:11:33.180 align:start position:0%
other children living in their home
 
05:11:35.270 --> 05:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
under or under their care is that right
 
05:11:37.850 --> 05:11:37.860 align:start position:0%
that is correct in in one person with
 
05:11:39.590 --> 05:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
whom I discussed this
 
05:11:42.830 --> 05:11:42.840 align:start position:0%
um made the point that those foster
 
05:11:44.868 --> 05:11:44.878 align:start position:0%
parents could therefore decide that they
 
05:11:46.788 --> 05:11:46.798 align:start position:0%
are not going to participate in the
 
05:11:50.590 --> 05:11:50.600 align:start position:0%
program right and that is true
 
05:11:53.150 --> 05:11:53.160 align:start position:0%
nevertheless that has a detrimental
 
05:11:56.090 --> 05:11:56.100 align:start position:0%
effect on the Foster Care Program
 
05:11:58.788 --> 05:11:58.798 align:start position:0%
um as I think DHHS has acknowledged with
 
05:12:01.368 --> 05:12:01.378 align:start position:0%
their emergency role and and may I have
 
05:12:04.128 --> 05:12:04.138 align:start position:0%
a follow-up Mr chairman follow-up
 
05:12:05.708 --> 05:12:05.718 align:start position:0%
um I wonder
 
05:12:09.050 --> 05:12:09.060 align:start position:0%
what the effect would be
 
05:12:09.060 --> 05:12:11.390 align:start position:0%
what the effect would be
um if

05:12:11.390 --> 05:12:11.400 align:start position:0%
um if
 
05:12:14.810 --> 05:12:14.820 align:start position:0%
instead of stating it as you have which
 
05:12:17.150 --> 05:12:17.160 align:start position:0%
is sort of a negative or maybe even a
 
05:12:21.470 --> 05:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
double negative uh one just stated and
 
05:12:23.868 --> 05:12:23.878 align:start position:0%
this is just a drafting it's not whether
 
05:12:27.650 --> 05:12:27.660 align:start position:0%
or not I agree with it uh that we make
 
05:12:30.110 --> 05:12:30.120 align:start position:0%
either direct reference to the statute
 
05:12:32.530 --> 05:12:32.540 align:start position:0%
where the other requirements are
 
05:12:36.170 --> 05:12:36.180 align:start position:0%
or put in the actual list
 
05:12:38.628 --> 05:12:38.638 align:start position:0%
with the language of the other ones
 
05:12:41.990 --> 05:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
right so as as we're speaking I received
 
05:12:44.990 --> 05:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
the draft copy from OLS so I can email
 
05:12:47.448 --> 05:12:47.458 align:start position:0%
that to the committee it is relatively
 
05:12:49.610 --> 05:12:49.620 align:start position:0%
short if the committee would like me to
 
05:12:51.470 --> 05:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
read it I can do that otherwise if it's
 
05:12:53.990 --> 05:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
your preference I can email it
 
05:12:59.208 --> 05:12:59.218 align:start position:0%
uh if it's really short go ahead okay uh
 
05:13:01.970 --> 05:13:01.980 align:start position:0%
inserting insert after section 27A the
 
05:13:04.128 --> 05:13:04.138 align:start position:0%

05:14:03.530 --> 05:14:03.540 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:14:07.970 --> 05:14:07.980 align:start position:0%
other questions representative Shapiro
 
05:14:09.890 --> 05:14:09.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:14:11.628 --> 05:14:11.638 align:start position:0%
taking this question
 
05:14:11.638 --> 05:14:12.890 align:start position:0%
taking this question
um

05:14:12.890 --> 05:14:12.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:16.550 --> 05:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
could you give us some indication it
 
05:14:19.070 --> 05:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be exact but what the
 
05:14:21.350 --> 05:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
you know comparative numbers of
 
05:14:25.070 --> 05:14:25.080 align:start position:0%
vaccinations in in that are required for
 
05:14:28.490 --> 05:14:28.500 align:start position:0%
schools in New Hampshire versus these
 
05:14:32.090 --> 05:14:32.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:34.490 --> 05:14:34.500 align:start position:0%
I actually tried to
 
05:14:36.830 --> 05:14:36.840 align:start position:0%
find out what the asip recommended list
 
05:14:40.910 --> 05:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
is and and I counted 32 however
 
05:14:43.128 --> 05:14:43.138 align:start position:0%
there may have been some there that were
 
05:14:43.138 --> 05:14:44.570 align:start position:0%
there may have been some there that were
not

05:14:44.570 --> 05:14:44.580 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:14:46.970 --> 05:14:46.980 align:start position:0%
recommended or not do don't fall under
 
05:14:49.788 --> 05:14:49.798 align:start position:0%
this requirement so I have to apologize
 
05:14:52.430 --> 05:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
that I was having trouble coming to a
 
05:14:54.948 --> 05:14:54.958 align:start position:0%
definitive number in part because there
 
05:14:56.448 --> 05:14:56.458 align:start position:0%
there are different lists for different
 
05:14:59.448 --> 05:14:59.458 align:start position:0%
age ranges so I think that some of the
 
05:15:01.490 --> 05:15:01.500 align:start position:0%
representatives from DHHS may be in a
 
05:15:03.250 --> 05:15:03.260 align:start position:0%
better position to answer that question
 
05:15:06.830 --> 05:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up I think the
 
05:15:07.850 --> 05:15:07.860 align:start position:0%
important thing is that it's
 
05:15:11.510 --> 05:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
significantly different correct but um
 
05:15:15.350 --> 05:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
second question or follow-up is
 
05:15:19.490 --> 05:15:19.500 align:start position:0%
do you have any sense of what the
 
05:15:23.628 --> 05:15:23.638 align:start position:0%
justification was for
 
05:15:26.708 --> 05:15:26.718 align:start position:0%
um having this increased coverage for
 
05:15:29.030 --> 05:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
children who were living in the foster
 
05:15:31.970 --> 05:15:31.980 align:start position:0%
homes does it was it indicative of a
 
05:15:34.310 --> 05:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
vulnerability for
 
05:15:37.010 --> 05:15:37.020 align:start position:0%
many foster children or maybe you don't
 
05:15:40.250 --> 05:15:40.260 align:start position:0%
know why it is well so the the
 
05:15:42.708 --> 05:15:42.718 align:start position:0%
the rule states that it applies to any
 
05:15:44.390 --> 05:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
situation which there is a foster child
 
05:15:47.570 --> 05:15:47.580 align:start position:0%
under six or a foster child with
 
05:15:50.448 --> 05:15:50.458 align:start position:0%
special medical needs so I think that
 
05:15:50.458 --> 05:15:51.890 align:start position:0%
special medical needs so I think that
the

05:15:51.890 --> 05:15:51.900 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:15:51.900 --> 05:15:52.610 align:start position:0%
the
um

05:15:52.610 --> 05:15:52.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:54.230 --> 05:15:54.240 align:start position:0%
I think the justification for it was
 
05:15:56.330 --> 05:15:56.340 align:start position:0%
well let's just do everything
 
05:15:59.570 --> 05:15:59.580 align:start position:0%
um so I I I don't know for sure
 
05:16:01.490 --> 05:16:01.500 align:start position:0%
um again DHHS may be able to speak to
 
05:16:03.530 --> 05:16:03.540 align:start position:0%
that I also want to point out that you
 
05:16:05.570 --> 05:16:05.580 align:start position:0%
know I think DHHS acted very promptly
 
05:16:07.850 --> 05:16:07.860 align:start position:0%
and very responsibly in when this issue
 
05:16:10.670 --> 05:16:10.680 align:start position:0%
was raised especially with respect to
 
05:16:14.390 --> 05:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
the covid-19 vaccine so I I just want to
 
05:16:15.708 --> 05:16:15.718 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that and thank the people
 
05:16:17.208 --> 05:16:17.218 align:start position:0%
who are responsible for that emergency
 
05:16:20.448 --> 05:16:20.458 align:start position:0%
rule having said that I I think there's
 
05:16:22.128 --> 05:16:22.138 align:start position:0%
a number you know we need to address the
 
05:16:23.990 --> 05:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
the problem in its entirety and that's
 
05:16:25.788 --> 05:16:25.798 align:start position:0%
why I brought the bill forward thank you
 
05:16:29.208 --> 05:16:29.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:35.090 --> 05:16:35.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:37.910 --> 05:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Beth Marjan
 
05:16:47.090 --> 05:16:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:49.070 --> 05:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
you you have five minutes ma'am I think
 
05:16:50.930 --> 05:16:50.940 align:start position:0%
but we've been asking people to hold the
 
05:16:53.090 --> 05:16:53.100 align:start position:0%
three so I will try
 
05:16:55.190 --> 05:16:55.200 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair thank you Mr chair Madam
 
05:16:56.628 --> 05:16:56.638 align:start position:0%
Vice chair members of the committee of
 
05:16:59.270 --> 05:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
the division uh appreciates the
 
05:17:00.948 --> 05:17:00.958 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak here today on this
 
05:17:04.250 --> 05:17:04.260 align:start position:0%
bill so as to representative kovalt's a
 
05:17:06.288 --> 05:17:06.298 align:start position:0%
question about the temporary rule making
 
05:17:08.510 --> 05:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
with respect to the covet vaccine that
 
05:17:11.208 --> 05:17:11.218 align:start position:0%
will be a permanent rule in about six
 
05:17:13.850 --> 05:17:13.860 align:start position:0%
months or so uh the reason being that I
 
05:17:16.310 --> 05:17:16.320 align:start position:0%
guess Dr Chan had testified the division
 
05:17:20.208 --> 05:17:20.218 align:start position:0%
is going to be in coordination with uh
 
05:17:23.090 --> 05:17:23.100 align:start position:0%
uh vaccination requirements for
 
05:17:25.868 --> 05:17:25.878 align:start position:0%
school-aged children and that it is a
 
05:17:28.250 --> 05:17:28.260 align:start position:0%
recommended but not required vaccination
 
05:17:30.410 --> 05:17:30.420 align:start position:0%
just like the flu vaccination so the
 
05:17:32.948 --> 05:17:32.958 align:start position:0%
coveted vaccine will be permanently uh
 
05:17:36.708 --> 05:17:36.718 align:start position:0%
Exempted from the rule in six months the
 
05:17:38.810 --> 05:17:38.820 align:start position:0%
other issue we do want to bring to the
 
05:17:42.650 --> 05:17:42.660 align:start position:0%
uh committee's attention is that the
 
05:17:44.930 --> 05:17:44.940 align:start position:0%
division already carves out vaccine
 
05:17:47.570 --> 05:17:47.580 align:start position:0%
station requirements for children over
 
05:17:50.150 --> 05:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
six and Foster homes under six we do
 
05:17:51.650 --> 05:17:51.660 align:start position:0%
require vaccinations because children
 
05:17:53.390 --> 05:17:53.400 align:start position:0%
are seem to be more vulnerable at that
 
05:17:56.750 --> 05:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
point the other issue we'd like to bring
 
05:17:58.610 --> 05:17:58.620 align:start position:0%
to the attention of the committee is
 
05:18:00.650 --> 05:18:00.660 align:start position:0%
that the national the national model
 
05:18:04.270 --> 05:18:04.280 align:start position:0%
Foster him I'm sorry National model
 
05:18:07.150 --> 05:18:07.160 align:start position:0%
Foster Family Home licensing standards
 
05:18:11.868 --> 05:18:11.878 align:start position:0%
uh was issued by the in 2019 by the
 
05:18:13.310 --> 05:18:13.320 align:start position:0%
federal government which actually was
 
05:18:16.368 --> 05:18:16.378 align:start position:0%
mandating the vaccines since then we
 
05:18:19.670 --> 05:18:19.680 align:start position:0%
have done the carve out for the um and
 
05:18:21.110 --> 05:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
this was prior to the covet vaccine but
 
05:18:23.208 --> 05:18:23.218 align:start position:0%
we have done the carve out for the covid
 
05:18:25.788 --> 05:18:25.798 align:start position:0%
vaccine we have done the carve out for
 
05:18:27.708 --> 05:18:27.718 align:start position:0%
exempting children over the age of six
 
05:18:31.850 --> 05:18:31.860 align:start position:0%
from uh from vaccination requirements
 
05:18:36.410 --> 05:18:36.420 align:start position:0%
um and so our concern is that
 
05:18:36.420 --> 05:18:37.190 align:start position:0%
um and so our concern is that
um

05:18:37.190 --> 05:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:39.650 --> 05:18:39.660 align:start position:0%
if we continue to carve out exemptions
 
05:18:42.288 --> 05:18:42.298 align:start position:0%
from these national standards that we
 
05:18:44.868 --> 05:18:44.878 align:start position:0%
may be at loss of risk of losing our 40
 
05:18:47.208 --> 05:18:47.218 align:start position:0%
funding and that is a concern for the
 
05:18:49.850 --> 05:18:49.860 align:start position:0%
division I do want to note that our
 
05:18:52.368 --> 05:18:52.378 align:start position:0%
foster families are very dedicated
 
05:18:56.208 --> 05:18:56.218 align:start position:0%
um and uh wonderful people who often
 
05:18:58.550 --> 05:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
accept more stringent requirements for
 
05:19:01.310 --> 05:19:01.320 align:start position:0%
in you know issues in their home perhaps
 
05:19:04.788 --> 05:19:04.798 align:start position:0%
fire code and other things and so they
 
05:19:07.368 --> 05:19:07.378 align:start position:0%
do volunteer to be our foster parents
 
05:19:08.930 --> 05:19:08.940 align:start position:0%
and they do this knowing all of the
 
05:19:11.510 --> 05:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
requirements that we that we require of
 
05:19:13.490 --> 05:19:13.500 align:start position:0%
them both from a state and a federal
 
05:19:13.500 --> 05:19:15.470 align:start position:0%
them both from a state and a federal
standard

05:19:15.470 --> 05:19:15.480 align:start position:0%
standard
 
05:19:17.330 --> 05:19:17.340 align:start position:0%
and I'll take any questions if anyone
 
05:19:19.368 --> 05:19:19.378 align:start position:0%
has any thank you representative Leon
 
05:19:21.650 --> 05:19:21.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:19:23.448 --> 05:19:23.458 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
05:19:25.128 --> 05:19:25.138 align:start position:0%
um a lot of my concern around this is
 
05:19:26.510 --> 05:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
that there may be families who are
 
05:19:28.250 --> 05:19:28.260 align:start position:0%
willing to foster but they don't want to
 
05:19:29.690 --> 05:19:29.700 align:start position:0%
have that forward requirement on their
 
05:19:31.310 --> 05:19:31.320 align:start position:0%
children do you know if we currently
 
05:19:33.288 --> 05:19:33.298 align:start position:0%
have an oversupply of foster families in
 
05:19:35.208 --> 05:19:35.218 align:start position:0%
the state we do not
 
05:19:37.730 --> 05:19:37.740 align:start position:0%
um we have had uh we have had less
 
05:19:39.590 --> 05:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
foster care applications we attribute
 
05:19:42.110 --> 05:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
that to the pandemic however we are
 
05:19:44.150 --> 05:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
actually getting uh we have a now robust
 
05:19:47.030 --> 05:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
very foster care outreach program and we
 
05:19:48.490 --> 05:19:48.500 align:start position:0%
are starting to get more foster care
 
05:19:51.650 --> 05:19:51.660 align:start position:0%
foster families online follow-up and as
 
05:19:53.150 --> 05:19:53.160 align:start position:0%
a follow-up generally do you have more
 
05:19:54.948 --> 05:19:54.958 align:start position:0%
trouble placing the younger foster kids
 
05:19:57.770 --> 05:19:57.780 align:start position:0%
or is that easier just because people
 
05:20:00.948 --> 05:20:00.958 align:start position:0%
like puppies and babies I I think so I
 
05:20:02.810 --> 05:20:02.820 align:start position:0%
mean I don't have any data just my
 
05:20:05.810 --> 05:20:05.820 align:start position:0%
anecdotal observations that from being
 
05:20:08.208 --> 05:20:08.218 align:start position:0%
working for dcy I think it is easier to
 
05:20:10.250 --> 05:20:10.260 align:start position:0%
to place younger children
 
05:20:12.230 --> 05:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
representative Weber and then
 
05:20:16.750 --> 05:20:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:19.910 --> 05:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
my first question would be uh are you
 
05:20:22.310 --> 05:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
aware of families who have dropped out
 
05:20:24.288 --> 05:20:24.298 align:start position:0%
of the foster care specifically because
 
05:20:27.770 --> 05:20:27.780 align:start position:0%
of these requirements I am not now okay
 
05:20:29.868 --> 05:20:29.878 align:start position:0%
thank you and may I have a follow-up Mr
 
05:20:29.878 --> 05:20:31.368 align:start position:0%
thank you and may I have a follow-up Mr
chairman

05:20:31.368 --> 05:20:31.378 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
05:20:31.378 --> 05:20:32.390 align:start position:0%
chairman
um

05:20:32.390 --> 05:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:20:35.448 --> 05:20:35.458 align:start position:0%
so what I'm interested in exploring is
 
05:20:35.458 --> 05:20:37.010 align:start position:0%
so what I'm interested in exploring is
that

05:20:37.010 --> 05:20:37.020 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:20:38.510 --> 05:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
I get that there are some national
 
05:20:44.530 --> 05:20:44.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:50.390 --> 05:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:52.550 --> 05:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
actually I think you may have actually
 
05:20:54.288 --> 05:20:54.298 align:start position:0%
answered that question when you said
 
05:20:56.330 --> 05:20:56.340 align:start position:0%
that we require a lot of things of
 
05:20:58.788 --> 05:20:58.798 align:start position:0%
foster families that we don't rip that
 
05:21:01.730 --> 05:21:01.740 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't have as requirements if
 
05:21:03.230 --> 05:21:03.240 align:start position:0%
they were just making decisions for
 
05:21:05.330 --> 05:21:05.340 align:start position:0%
their own kids so I think I've answered
 
05:21:07.690 --> 05:21:07.700 align:start position:0%
my own question thank you thank you
 
05:21:09.890 --> 05:21:09.900 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro
 
05:21:09.900 --> 05:21:11.090 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro
yes

05:21:11.090 --> 05:21:11.100 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:21:12.830 --> 05:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
05:21:12.840 --> 05:21:13.788 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman and thank you
for

05:21:13.788 --> 05:21:13.798 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:21:15.350 --> 05:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
um responding to my question I think
 
05:21:18.770 --> 05:21:18.780 align:start position:0%
alarms go off for many people in our
 
05:21:21.970 --> 05:21:21.980 align:start position:0%
committee when we hear that um
 
05:21:24.910 --> 05:21:24.920 align:start position:0%
that's some medical
 
05:21:26.990 --> 05:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
procedure is going to be required
 
05:21:29.270 --> 05:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
because we might lose money
 
05:21:31.310 --> 05:21:31.320 align:start position:0%
um and so I'll ask you the same question
 
05:21:33.788 --> 05:21:33.798 align:start position:0%
which is what is the medical
 
05:21:37.070 --> 05:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
justification for adding a greater list
 
05:21:40.788 --> 05:21:40.798 align:start position:0%
for the children of foster or parents
 
05:21:43.430 --> 05:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
um what is what are the protective
 
05:21:47.750 --> 05:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
factors that we're trying to cover here
 
05:21:50.030 --> 05:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
Nation requirements sir I can't answer
 
05:21:51.770 --> 05:21:51.780 align:start position:0%
that I would defer
 
05:21:52.970 --> 05:21:52.980 align:start position:0%
deferred health
 
05:21:54.770 --> 05:21:54.780 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:21:57.590 --> 05:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
05:21:59.810 --> 05:21:59.820 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you okay thank you so
 
05:21:59.820 --> 05:22:02.230 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you okay thank you so
much

05:22:02.230 --> 05:22:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:06.288 --> 05:22:06.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:08.750 --> 05:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
no I think I'll withdraw that one too I
 
05:22:11.510 --> 05:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
I I'm still trying to formulate what I'm
 
05:22:12.590 --> 05:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
trying to get at but I think it's
 
05:22:14.890 --> 05:22:14.900 align:start position:0%
probably best left to Executive session
 
05:22:17.810 --> 05:22:17.820 align:start position:0%
okay representative Cushman thank you Mr
 
05:22:19.430 --> 05:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
05:22:22.430 --> 05:22:22.440 align:start position:0%
question uh you mentioned uh worrying
 
05:22:24.708 --> 05:22:24.718 align:start position:0%
about if we do any more carve outs from
 
05:22:26.868 --> 05:22:26.878 align:start position:0%
these Federal standards that uh we may
 
05:22:29.208 --> 05:22:29.218 align:start position:0%
be at risk of losing any funding
 
05:22:31.788 --> 05:22:31.798 align:start position:0%
um but it seems that it's already been
 
05:22:34.190 --> 05:22:34.200 align:start position:0%
done twice have has there been any loss
 
05:22:35.990 --> 05:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
of funding there hasn't we've been
 
05:22:37.070 --> 05:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
working closely with the federal
 
05:22:38.628 --> 05:22:38.638 align:start position:0%
government on those two current carve
 
05:22:40.910 --> 05:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
outs that we've had for them
 
05:22:44.448 --> 05:22:44.458 align:start position:0%
follow up so is it does it follow
 
05:22:46.310 --> 05:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
logically then that you could continue
 
05:22:47.650 --> 05:22:47.660 align:start position:0%
working with the federal government
 
05:22:51.830 --> 05:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
regarding this if we pass this bill
 
05:22:53.150 --> 05:22:53.160 align:start position:0%
I don't know again that was something I
 
05:22:54.650 --> 05:22:54.660 align:start position:0%
would defer to Public Health about
 
05:22:56.628 --> 05:22:56.638 align:start position:0%
because this is a broader range of
 
05:22:58.730 --> 05:22:58.740 align:start position:0%
vaccination requirements
 
05:23:00.230 --> 05:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
um than what the federal government had
 
05:23:01.910 --> 05:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
approved in 2019. thank you
 
05:23:03.590 --> 05:23:03.600 align:start position:0%

chairman
 
05:23:06.288 --> 05:23:06.298 align:start position:0%
um just following up on the potential
 
05:23:08.868 --> 05:23:08.878 align:start position:0%
loss of funds we've heard from other
 
05:23:10.910 --> 05:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
divisions in other departments that when
 
05:23:12.590 --> 05:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
it were out of compliance they don't
 
05:23:14.448 --> 05:23:14.458 align:start position:0%
immediately withdraw the funds there's a
 
05:23:16.490 --> 05:23:16.500 align:start position:0%
remediation process have you ever had
 
05:23:17.990 --> 05:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
the experience where the funds have
 
05:23:20.570 --> 05:23:20.580 align:start position:0%
automatic have immediately been revoked
 
05:23:22.250 --> 05:23:22.260 align:start position:0%
I do not know the answer to that
 
05:23:24.350 --> 05:23:24.360 align:start position:0%
question thank you sorry
 
05:23:26.930 --> 05:23:26.940 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
05:23:29.628 --> 05:23:29.638 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions okay thank you
 
05:23:34.910 --> 05:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:36.470 --> 05:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is
 
05:23:38.150 --> 05:23:38.160 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly Potenza from
 
05:23:38.160 --> 05:23:52.490 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly Potenza from
Rochester

05:23:52.490 --> 05:23:52.500 align:start position:0%

05:23:56.208 --> 05:23:56.218 align:start position:0%
thank you chair uh representative

Potenza Stratford District 19.
 
05:24:01.550 --> 05:24:01.560 align:start position:0%
so this kind of piggybacks on what I had
 
05:24:02.930 --> 05:24:02.940 align:start position:0%
said before
 
05:24:05.510 --> 05:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
um in regards with a subset making
 
05:24:07.128 --> 05:24:07.138 align:start position:0%
decisions but
 
05:24:10.250 --> 05:24:10.260 align:start position:0%
this was passed June 5th of 2020 and
 
05:24:12.288 --> 05:24:12.298 align:start position:0%
there's many of us that were screaming
 
05:24:15.410 --> 05:24:15.420 align:start position:0%
very loudly about this this is truly
 
05:24:15.420 --> 05:24:17.170 align:start position:0%
very loudly about this this is truly
discrimination

05:24:17.170 --> 05:24:17.180 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
05:24:20.270 --> 05:24:20.280 align:start position:0%
no question about it so we're going to
 
05:24:21.590 --> 05:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
have rules
 
05:24:25.190 --> 05:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
for some in different rules for others
 
05:24:27.110 --> 05:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
and to answer the question of
 
05:24:29.510 --> 05:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
Representative Weber I will give you
 
05:24:32.208 --> 05:24:32.218 align:start position:0%
five names of families that decided that
 
05:24:35.030 --> 05:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
they were not going to Foster and
 
05:24:37.128 --> 05:24:37.138 align:start position:0%
actually a family that did Foster that
 
05:24:37.138 --> 05:24:38.570 align:start position:0%
actually a family that did Foster that
moved

05:24:38.570 --> 05:24:38.580 align:start position:0%
moved
 
05:24:39.890 --> 05:24:39.900 align:start position:0%
um out of state
 
05:24:42.770 --> 05:24:42.780 align:start position:0%
because of this when it passed and it
 
05:24:44.390 --> 05:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
was so heart-wrenching
 
05:24:47.208 --> 05:24:47.218 align:start position:0%
and everybody was so confused by it they
 
05:24:49.368 --> 05:24:49.378 align:start position:0%
thought it was going to be affecting
 
05:24:52.610 --> 05:24:52.620 align:start position:0%
this the children that were coming in it
 
05:24:52.620 --> 05:24:53.570 align:start position:0%
this the children that were coming in it
wasn't

05:24:53.570 --> 05:24:53.580 align:start position:0%
wasn't
 
05:24:56.270 --> 05:24:56.280 align:start position:0%
it was a you know Wonderful giving kind

loving families that wanted to take
 
05:24:58.620 --> 05:24:59.690 align:start position:0%
loving families that wanted to take
children

05:24:59.690 --> 05:24:59.700 align:start position:0%
children
 
05:25:01.310 --> 05:25:01.320 align:start position:0%
into their homes
 
05:25:03.410 --> 05:25:03.420 align:start position:0%
that they were going to have to to
 
05:25:05.990 --> 05:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
include the parents go all the way back
 
05:25:08.208 --> 05:25:08.218 align:start position:0%
to a schedule so
 
05:25:10.910 --> 05:25:10.920 align:start position:0%
it was just unbelievable that there
 
05:25:12.770 --> 05:25:12.780 align:start position:0%
would be no exemptions for those
 
05:25:12.780 --> 05:25:13.910 align:start position:0%
would be no exemptions for those
families

05:25:13.910 --> 05:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
families
 
05:25:16.128 --> 05:25:16.138 align:start position:0%
and that the children coming in would
 
05:25:18.350 --> 05:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
have to be up to date wouldn't have to
 
05:25:19.850 --> 05:25:19.860 align:start position:0%
be up to date on any schedule they could
 
05:25:21.890 --> 05:25:21.900 align:start position:0%
have an exemption
 
05:25:26.150 --> 05:25:26.160 align:start position:0%
this is truly common sense to me so when
 
05:25:28.250 --> 05:25:28.260 align:start position:0%
JL Carr passed this
 
05:25:30.770 --> 05:25:30.780 align:start position:0%
it was a vote of seven to three
 
05:25:33.350 --> 05:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
how many people fall in our legislature
 
05:25:33.360 --> 05:25:36.050 align:start position:0%
how many people fall in our legislature
400.

05:25:36.050 --> 05:25:36.060 align:start position:0%
400.
 
05:25:38.930 --> 05:25:38.940 align:start position:0%
I I can't believe here we are in 2023
 
05:25:40.990 --> 05:25:41.000 align:start position:0%
and we're finally getting rid of this
 
05:25:43.850 --> 05:25:43.860 align:start position:0%
this is not this is this is not a
 
05:25:43.860 --> 05:25:45.288 align:start position:0%
this is not this is this is not a
partisan

05:25:45.288 --> 05:25:45.298 align:start position:0%
partisan
 
05:25:47.570 --> 05:25:47.580 align:start position:0%
um Bill this is the right thing to do
 
05:25:49.750 --> 05:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
for something very wrong that happened
 
05:25:53.030 --> 05:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
and uh I'm really passionate about it so
 
05:25:54.230 --> 05:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
there's going to be someone else that's
 
05:25:55.550 --> 05:25:55.560 align:start position:0%
going to come up to speak that got me
 
05:25:57.410 --> 05:25:57.420 align:start position:0%
really passionate about it so if you
 
05:25:59.510 --> 05:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
have any questions
 
05:26:01.970 --> 05:26:01.980 align:start position:0%
any questions yes representative King
 
05:26:03.590 --> 05:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman McDonald and thank
 
05:26:05.150 --> 05:26:05.160 align:start position:0%
you for being here today
 
05:26:05.160 --> 05:26:05.930 align:start position:0%
you for being here today
um

05:26:05.930 --> 05:26:05.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:07.430 --> 05:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
I don't fully understand everything
 
05:26:09.830 --> 05:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
about the foster care system is there is
 
05:26:12.170 --> 05:26:12.180 align:start position:0%
it is it strictly government run or is
 
05:26:14.868 --> 05:26:14.878 align:start position:0%
there a private alternative that people
 
05:26:16.310 --> 05:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
can be a part of that has different
 
05:26:18.650 --> 05:26:18.660 align:start position:0%
standards because I mean it makes sense
 
05:26:20.390 --> 05:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
to me that if the government is running
 
05:26:22.550 --> 05:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
it that there's they're going to make
 
05:26:24.590 --> 05:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
the standards on what is required I mean
 
05:26:26.330 --> 05:26:26.340 align:start position:0%
you don't want to send poor foster
 
05:26:27.770 --> 05:26:27.780 align:start position:0%
children that have no control over their
 
05:26:29.990 --> 05:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
own lives into like a really bad living
 
05:26:30.000 --> 05:26:31.670 align:start position:0%
own lives into like a really bad living
situation

05:26:31.670 --> 05:26:31.680 align:start position:0%
situation
 
05:26:33.350 --> 05:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
um and so it makes sense at least
 
05:26:34.788 --> 05:26:34.798 align:start position:0%
logically that you know you're going to
 
05:26:36.410 --> 05:26:36.420 align:start position:0%
make sure that they're not sent into a
 
05:26:37.970 --> 05:26:37.980 align:start position:0%
disease-ridden home or something like
 
05:26:37.980 --> 05:26:39.170 align:start position:0%
disease-ridden home or something like
that

05:26:39.170 --> 05:26:39.180 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:26:41.330 --> 05:26:41.340 align:start position:0%
um so but but the thing is is that I
 
05:26:43.788 --> 05:26:43.798 align:start position:0%
also understand that you know we have
 
05:26:45.110 --> 05:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
different values in this country and
 
05:26:47.090 --> 05:26:47.100 align:start position:0%
there might be some people who have a
 
05:26:48.830 --> 05:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
more hands-off approach to vaccines and
 
05:26:50.330 --> 05:26:50.340 align:start position:0%
some people who are much more stringent
 
05:26:52.128 --> 05:26:52.138 align:start position:0%
about it and that if there was some
 
05:26:54.170 --> 05:26:54.180 align:start position:0%
choice in the matter that would that
 
05:26:55.610 --> 05:26:55.620 align:start position:0%
would be really nice so can you just
 
05:26:57.830 --> 05:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
clue me in is there choice right now for
 
05:27:00.230 --> 05:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
there is no choice that's the difference
 
05:27:03.708 --> 05:27:03.718 align:start position:0%
it's mandate just for that specific
 
05:27:05.868 --> 05:27:05.878 align:start position:0%
group that subset that's just
 
05:27:08.390 --> 05:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
discriminatory it's appalling to be
 
05:27:11.208 --> 05:27:11.218 align:start position:0%
honest that this ever went through
 
05:27:13.910 --> 05:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
05:27:19.490 --> 05:27:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:22.610 --> 05:27:22.620 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Laura Condon
 
05:27:30.230 --> 05:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:33.170 --> 05:27:33.180 align:start position:0%
I promise thank you but I can tell you
 
05:27:35.208 --> 05:27:35.218 align:start position:0%
this is my file from have attending gel
 
05:27:37.250 --> 05:27:37.260 align:start position:0%
Carr I went through the process of these
 
05:27:39.830 --> 05:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
Foster family Rules
 
05:27:39.840 --> 05:27:45.850 align:start position:0%
Foster family Rules
foreign

05:27:45.850 --> 05:27:45.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:49.070 --> 05:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
my name is my name is Laura Condon I'm
 
05:27:51.350 --> 05:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
from Bedford and I'm here in support of
 
05:27:53.868 --> 05:27:53.878 align:start position:0%
House Bill 508 as amended with the
 
05:27:56.330 --> 05:27:56.340 align:start position:0%
amendment that representative colfault
 
05:27:56.340 --> 05:27:57.530 align:start position:0%
amendment that representative colfault
presented

05:27:57.530 --> 05:27:57.540 align:start position:0%
presented
 
05:27:59.690 --> 05:27:59.700 align:start position:0%
um I do want to mention first that
 
05:28:03.410 --> 05:28:03.420 align:start position:0%
contrary to Dr Chan's claim that DHHS
 
05:28:05.448 --> 05:28:05.458 align:start position:0%
does not mandate covet and flu shots
 
05:28:05.458 --> 05:28:06.708 align:start position:0%
does not mandate covet and flu shots
because

05:28:06.708 --> 05:28:06.718 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:28:08.750 --> 05:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
he said that they are you know annual
 
05:28:13.430 --> 05:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
shots in fact it was dhhs's rule that
 
05:28:16.670 --> 05:28:16.680 align:start position:0%
imposes covet and flu shots on Foster
 
05:28:19.190 --> 05:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
family so in fact they do do exactly
 
05:28:20.690 --> 05:28:20.700 align:start position:0%
what he said they don't do
 
05:28:23.288 --> 05:28:23.298 align:start position:0%
the Foster family rule
 
05:28:27.708 --> 05:28:27.718 align:start position:0%
hac-6446 sets into law authority to the
 
05:28:29.930 --> 05:28:29.940 align:start position:0%
CDC to set State vaccine requirements
 
05:28:31.970 --> 05:28:31.980 align:start position:0%
that include the entire vaccine schedule
 
05:28:33.948 --> 05:28:33.958 align:start position:0%
they recommend today and in the future
 
05:28:36.850 --> 05:28:36.860 align:start position:0%
without any state oversight review
 
05:28:40.490 --> 05:28:40.500 align:start position:0%
anytime the CDC has additional doses to
 
05:28:43.070 --> 05:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
vaccines automatically that's imposed on
 
05:28:45.830 --> 05:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
children and Foster Family households
 
05:28:45.840 --> 05:28:47.690 align:start position:0%
children and Foster Family households
um

05:28:47.690 --> 05:28:47.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:28:50.150 --> 05:28:50.160 align:start position:0%
there and and correct some information
 
05:28:50.160 --> 05:28:51.350 align:start position:0%
there and and correct some information
here

05:28:51.350 --> 05:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:28:53.690 --> 05:28:53.700 align:start position:0%
um they're they're the requirements are
 
05:28:56.810 --> 05:28:56.820 align:start position:0%
in children of all ages the age six is
 
05:28:59.208 --> 05:28:59.218 align:start position:0%
just that when there is a foster child
 
05:29:02.150 --> 05:29:02.160 align:start position:0%
in the family who is six years and older
 
05:29:04.970 --> 05:29:04.980 align:start position:0%
then the rules change
 
05:29:08.570 --> 05:29:08.580 align:start position:0%
um but they don't change on the the the
 
05:29:12.050 --> 05:29:12.060 align:start position:0%
um the children in the household so when
 
05:29:13.368 --> 05:29:13.378 align:start position:0%
um in situations where there's a
 
05:29:15.830 --> 05:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
biological child who's not in daycare a
 
05:29:17.570 --> 05:29:17.580 align:start position:0%
public private school there's no
 
05:29:19.910 --> 05:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
exemptions for them because they're only
 
05:29:23.628 --> 05:29:23.638 align:start position:0%
allowed the school vaccine exemptions
 
05:29:25.690 --> 05:29:25.700 align:start position:0%
state law
 
05:29:28.128 --> 05:29:28.138 align:start position:0%
excuse me please be mindful that the
 
05:29:29.990 --> 05:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
Foster family Rules also impose vaccine
 
05:29:31.430 --> 05:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
requirements on adults for the first
 
05:29:33.530 --> 05:29:33.540 align:start position:0%
time ever with the pertussis and flu
 
05:29:35.570 --> 05:29:35.580 align:start position:0%
shot mandates where there's a foster
 
05:29:37.250 --> 05:29:37.260 align:start position:0%
infant and a foster child with special
 
05:29:38.868 --> 05:29:38.878 align:start position:0%
medical needs they all have special
 
05:29:41.208 --> 05:29:41.218 align:start position:0%
medical needs there is no exemption to
 
05:29:43.010 --> 05:29:43.020 align:start position:0%
these mandates on adults other than
 
05:29:44.690 --> 05:29:44.700 align:start position:0%
medical there's no exemptions for
 
05:29:46.788 --> 05:29:46.798 align:start position:0%
pregnant women prior adverse reactions
 
05:29:48.590 --> 05:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
religious beliefs or beliefs of
 
05:29:51.708 --> 05:29:51.718 align:start position:0%
conscience DHHS did not have to adopt
 
05:29:54.410 --> 05:29:54.420 align:start position:0%
such aggressive rules and I testified to
 
05:29:56.570 --> 05:29:56.580 align:start position:0%
that fact and provided evidence they
 
05:29:58.070 --> 05:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
will claim they needed to impose these
 
05:29:59.810 --> 05:29:59.820 align:start position:0%
mandates to receive federal money that
 
05:30:01.250 --> 05:30:01.260 align:start position:0%
is not true
 
05:30:03.770 --> 05:30:03.780 align:start position:0%
they needed only to recommend all these
 
05:30:06.230 --> 05:30:06.240 align:start position:0%
vaccines in all situations not require
 
05:30:08.750 --> 05:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
them and we've seen other states do it
 
05:30:10.750 --> 05:30:10.760 align:start position:0%
just make a recommendation
 
05:30:13.310 --> 05:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
a recommendation that rule would have
 
05:30:14.868 --> 05:30:14.878 align:start position:0%
put them in compliance with the strings
 
05:30:17.330 --> 05:30:17.340 align:start position:0%
attached to Federal money they chose not
 
05:30:18.830 --> 05:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
to make it a recommendation they had
 
05:30:21.288 --> 05:30:21.298 align:start position:0%
chose to impose requirements that's
 
05:30:23.628 --> 05:30:23.638 align:start position:0%
because if I testified earlier DHHS is
 
05:30:25.490 --> 05:30:25.500 align:start position:0%
in the vaccine business having taken
 
05:30:26.868 --> 05:30:26.878 align:start position:0%
over the purchase and sailed all
 
05:30:28.750 --> 05:30:28.760 align:start position:0%
vaccines targeted children
 
05:30:31.730 --> 05:30:31.740 align:start position:0%
and is fully funded by the CDC for their
 
05:30:34.430 --> 05:30:34.440 align:start position:0%
High vaccine purchases DHHS seeks every
 
05:30:36.050 --> 05:30:36.060 align:start position:0%
opportunity to increase these vaccine
 
05:30:38.330 --> 05:30:38.340 align:start position:0%
sales and this is a huge conflict of
 
05:30:38.340 --> 05:30:41.030 align:start position:0%
sales and this is a huge conflict of
interest

05:30:41.030 --> 05:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:43.368 --> 05:30:43.378 align:start position:0%
um and and yes the the bill you have
 
05:30:45.350 --> 05:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
before you inadvertently gives authority
 
05:30:47.868 --> 05:30:47.878 align:start position:0%
to DHHS to impose these vaccine
 
05:30:49.550 --> 05:30:49.560 align:start position:0%
requirements and I urge you to strongly
 
05:30:51.470 --> 05:30:51.480 align:start position:0%
consider I'm repping up the the
 
05:30:51.480 --> 05:30:52.730 align:start position:0%
consider I'm repping up the the
amendment

05:30:52.730 --> 05:30:52.740 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:30:54.830 --> 05:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
um as a replace for this bill I think
 
05:30:56.570 --> 05:30:56.580 align:start position:0%
that is does appropriate worded to
 
05:30:58.730 --> 05:30:58.740 align:start position:0%
protect not just the foster children but
 
05:30:59.930 --> 05:30:59.940 align:start position:0%
the other children in the household
 
05:31:02.390 --> 05:31:02.400 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions thank you
 
05:31:02.400 --> 05:31:05.090 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions thank you
questions

05:31:05.090 --> 05:31:05.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:07.368 --> 05:31:07.378 align:start position:0%
seeing no questions
 
05:31:13.670 --> 05:31:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:15.948 --> 05:31:15.958 align:start position:0%
last person who has signed up to testify
 
05:31:25.310 --> 05:31:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:29.448 --> 05:31:29.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:33.170 --> 05:31:33.180 align:start position:0%
I'm testifying in favor of HB 408 and I
 
05:31:35.628 --> 05:31:35.638 align:start position:0%
believe the last person also meant they
 
05:31:39.230 --> 05:31:39.240 align:start position:0%
were testifying in favor of 408 not 508
 
05:31:41.990 --> 05:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
the the cdc's advisory committee on
 
05:31:44.150 --> 05:31:44.160 align:start position:0%
immunization practices is a group of
 
05:31:46.730 --> 05:31:46.740 align:start position:0%
about a dozen vaccine scientists who've
 
05:31:49.368 --> 05:31:49.378 align:start position:0%
been appointed by the CDC and this group
 
05:31:52.310 --> 05:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
is asked to sign off on CDC vaccine
 
05:31:54.470 --> 05:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
recommendations and invariably always
 
05:31:56.448 --> 05:31:56.458 align:start position:0%
does so
 
05:31:58.190 --> 05:31:58.200 align:start position:0%
um the asip
 
05:32:00.708 --> 05:32:00.718 align:start position:0%
has issued recommendations for 26
 
05:32:02.810 --> 05:32:02.820 align:start position:0%
vaccine different vaccines
 
05:32:05.030 --> 05:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
and at least 15 different vaccines are
 
05:32:06.770 --> 05:32:06.780 align:start position:0%
recommended for healthy children in the
 
05:32:06.780 --> 05:32:07.970 align:start position:0%
recommended for healthy children in the
U.S

05:32:07.970 --> 05:32:07.980 align:start position:0%
U.S
 
05:32:09.890 --> 05:32:09.900 align:start position:0%
there are two groups of consumer
 
05:32:11.510 --> 05:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
products for which manufacturer
 
05:32:14.930 --> 05:32:14.940 align:start position:0%
liability is waived in the U.S the first
 
05:32:17.510 --> 05:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
group includes every vaccine that is
 
05:32:20.510 --> 05:32:20.520 align:start position:0%
recommended by the acip for the
 
05:32:23.090 --> 05:32:23.100 align:start position:0%
childhood schedule
 
05:32:25.850 --> 05:32:25.860 align:start position:0%
in other words that's how you get your
 
05:32:28.190 --> 05:32:28.200 align:start position:0%
liability waived is by getting your
 
05:32:30.590 --> 05:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
vaccine placed on the childhood schedule
 
05:32:33.470 --> 05:32:33.480 align:start position:0%
and all it requires is a vote by the
 
05:32:33.480 --> 05:32:34.910 align:start position:0%
and all it requires is a vote by the
asip

05:32:34.910 --> 05:32:34.920 align:start position:0%
asip
 
05:32:37.670 --> 05:32:37.680 align:start position:0%
the second group contains vaccines and
 
05:32:39.948 --> 05:32:39.958 align:start position:0%
drugs designated as covered
 
05:32:42.410 --> 05:32:42.420 align:start position:0%
countermeasures for pandemics or
 
05:32:44.628 --> 05:32:44.638 align:start position:0%
biological warfare and this group
 
05:32:47.868 --> 05:32:47.878 align:start position:0%
includes all coveted vaccines
 
05:32:50.868 --> 05:32:50.878 align:start position:0%
all ASAP recommended childhood vaccines
 
05:32:53.690 --> 05:32:53.700 align:start position:0%
have no liability
 
05:32:56.090 --> 05:32:56.100 align:start position:0%
avoiding product liability for their
 
05:32:58.310 --> 05:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
vaccines is obviously a huge financial
 
05:33:01.128 --> 05:33:01.138 align:start position:0%
Boon for the industry and therefore
 
05:33:03.890 --> 05:33:03.900 align:start position:0%
great pressure has been applied to
 
05:33:06.170 --> 05:33:06.180 align:start position:0%
expand the vaccines recommended for the
 
05:33:09.410 --> 05:33:09.420 align:start position:0%
childhood schedule in fact in 2016 a law
 
05:33:11.390 --> 05:33:11.400 align:start position:0%
was passed by Congress saying that every
 
05:33:13.448 --> 05:33:13.458 align:start position:0%
vaccine recommended for pregnant women
 
05:33:18.250 --> 05:33:18.260 align:start position:0%
would also get this liability waiver
 
05:33:21.530 --> 05:33:21.540 align:start position:0%
turning vaccines during pregnancy into a
 
05:33:25.430 --> 05:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:28.970 --> 05:33:28.980 align:start position:0%
thus the ACP acip recommendations have
 
05:33:31.730 --> 05:33:31.740 align:start position:0%
become commercialized and should never
 
05:33:35.510 --> 05:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
be adopted wholesale by the states
 
05:33:38.090 --> 05:33:38.100 align:start position:0%
but in New Hampshire they are yet only
 
05:33:40.910 --> 05:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
for the non-fostered children of foster
 
05:33:40.920 --> 05:33:42.530 align:start position:0%
for the non-fostered children of foster
parents

05:33:42.530 --> 05:33:42.540 align:start position:0%
parents
 
05:33:47.570 --> 05:33:47.580 align:start position:0%
please fix this anomaly bypassing hb408
 
05:33:49.128 --> 05:33:49.138 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
05:33:49.138 --> 05:33:50.570 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
questions

05:33:50.570 --> 05:33:50.580 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:33:53.030 --> 05:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
yes representative Cushman thank you Mr
 
05:33:56.330 --> 05:33:56.340 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you again for testifying
 
05:33:58.970 --> 05:33:58.980 align:start position:0%
um so what it sounds like here is there
 
05:34:01.788 --> 05:34:01.798 align:start position:0%
is some Financial incentive to get
 
05:34:06.948 --> 05:34:06.958 align:start position:0%
vaccines onto under this coverage this
 
05:34:10.910 --> 05:34:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:13.788 --> 05:34:13.798 align:start position:0%
so for that to happen it would mean that
 
05:34:16.850 --> 05:34:16.860 align:start position:0%
this board the AI acip would members of
 
05:34:18.350 --> 05:34:18.360 align:start position:0%
it may be compromised and have some
 
05:34:21.110 --> 05:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
conflicts of interest do you know of any
 
05:34:26.208 --> 05:34:26.218 align:start position:0%
um mem any evidence or or yes I I do so
 
05:34:28.788 --> 05:34:28.798 align:start position:0%
um representative Dan Burton who was the
 
05:34:31.430 --> 05:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
head of the committee on government
 
05:34:36.128 --> 05:34:36.138 align:start position:0%
reform in the house in 2000 2001
 
05:34:38.570 --> 05:34:38.580 align:start position:0%
investigated this and at that time found
 
05:34:41.090 --> 05:34:41.100 align:start position:0%
that about half the members on the acip
 
05:34:43.670 --> 05:34:43.680 align:start position:0%
had Financial conflicts of interest with
 
05:34:46.670 --> 05:34:46.680 align:start position:0%
the vaccine industry and subsequent to
 
05:34:49.010 --> 05:34:49.020 align:start position:0%
that there have been papers published
 
05:34:51.948 --> 05:34:51.958 align:start position:0%
showing that members of federal advisory
 
05:34:53.390 --> 05:34:53.400 align:start position:0%
committees have
 
05:34:56.810 --> 05:34:56.820 align:start position:0%
forward and backward conflicts so many
 
05:34:58.970 --> 05:34:58.980 align:start position:0%
of them can be assured they will get
 
05:35:02.030 --> 05:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
contracts or jobs after they finish
 
05:35:04.190 --> 05:35:04.200 align:start position:0%
their service on a federal advisory
 
05:35:04.200 --> 05:35:06.650 align:start position:0%
their service on a federal advisory
committee

05:35:06.650 --> 05:35:06.660 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:35:09.948 --> 05:35:09.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:24.770 --> 05:35:24.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:27.110 --> 05:35:27.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:35:28.850 --> 05:35:28.860 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is
 
05:35:33.288 --> 05:35:33.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:43.730 --> 05:35:43.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:45.230 --> 05:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
oh thank you very much I'm president
 
05:35:46.970 --> 05:35:46.980 align:start position:0%
Timothy Horrigan from Stratford County
 
05:35:49.970 --> 05:35:49.980 align:start position:0%
district 10. and look I was mostly here
 
05:35:51.770 --> 05:35:51.780 align:start position:0%
for another bill sponsoring that's
 
05:35:54.650 --> 05:35:54.660 align:start position:0%
coming in much later than this but
 
05:35:57.410 --> 05:35:57.420 align:start position:0%
I just think it's a simple common sense
 
05:36:00.470 --> 05:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
that uh that's the chill that children
 
05:36:02.510 --> 05:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
who are placed in foster care
 
05:36:02.520 --> 05:36:03.530 align:start position:0%
who are placed in foster care
um

05:36:03.530 --> 05:36:03.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:36:07.550 --> 05:36:07.560 align:start position:0%
should be uh they should be uh subject
 
05:36:10.430 --> 05:36:10.440 align:start position:0%
to subject to like the uh should be
 
05:36:13.550 --> 05:36:13.560 align:start position:0%
vaccinated um I don't uh and the and
 
05:36:15.830 --> 05:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
that should apply also to the
 
05:36:17.990 --> 05:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
Foster families other children since the
 
05:36:20.390 --> 05:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
vaccines uh don't really care whether or
 
05:36:21.770 --> 05:36:21.780 align:start position:0%
not you're a foster child they're not
 
05:36:23.750 --> 05:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
aware of that it's a uh
 
05:36:26.330 --> 05:36:26.340 align:start position:0%
it's an inanimate object that just wants
 
05:36:28.550 --> 05:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
to reproduce itself so it like doesn't
 
05:36:30.530 --> 05:36:30.540 align:start position:0%
know who's to foster child and who's not
 
05:36:33.890 --> 05:36:33.900 align:start position:0%
so and I um
 
05:36:36.288 --> 05:36:36.298 align:start position:0%
and I also think the uh
 
05:36:38.628 --> 05:36:38.638 align:start position:0%
I also believe the vaccines are not
 
05:36:40.610 --> 05:36:40.620 align:start position:0%
perfect but they were thoroughly tested
 
05:36:42.050 --> 05:36:42.060 align:start position:0%
they're thoroughly safe and of course
 
05:36:44.150 --> 05:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
this comes into context
 
05:36:46.670 --> 05:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
of the covid-19 pandemic which is still
 
05:36:49.128 --> 05:36:49.138 align:start position:0%
going on even though we've now moved on
 
05:36:50.628 --> 05:36:50.638 align:start position:0%
to worrying about worrying about other
 
05:36:53.270 --> 05:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
things it has killed 250 000 people just
 
05:36:55.310 --> 05:36:55.320 align:start position:0%
in the last year
 
05:36:58.670 --> 05:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
um about 1.15 million uh since we first
 
05:37:00.650 --> 05:37:00.660 align:start position:0%
discovered it three years ago so that's
 
05:37:02.868 --> 05:37:02.878 align:start position:0%
that's a very major catastrophe major
 
05:37:04.910 --> 05:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
cause of death it's uh
 
05:37:07.010 --> 05:37:07.020 align:start position:0%
worse than a lot of other things that we
 
05:37:09.288 --> 05:37:09.298 align:start position:0%
worry about a lot more at the moment so
 
05:37:10.910 --> 05:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
I would uh
 
05:37:13.850 --> 05:37:13.860 align:start position:0%
so so I would say this bill uh and
 
05:37:15.770 --> 05:37:15.780 align:start position:0%
Austin bills also it's kind of
 
05:37:18.288 --> 05:37:18.298 align:start position:0%
it's confusing and badly written anyways
 
05:37:20.510 --> 05:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
I think for those I think so I think
 
05:37:21.530 --> 05:37:21.540 align:start position:0%
first of all
 
05:37:24.110 --> 05:37:24.120 align:start position:0%
making sure the families Foster family's
 
05:37:25.490 --> 05:37:25.500 align:start position:0%
own children are vaccinated is not an
 
05:37:27.590 --> 05:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
unreasonable requirement in my in my
 
05:37:29.390 --> 05:37:29.400 align:start position:0%
opinion and there may be valid
 
05:37:31.610 --> 05:37:31.620 align:start position:0%
exceptions for that um
 
05:37:33.110 --> 05:37:33.120 align:start position:0%
and bear in mind they are paid a
 
05:37:34.610 --> 05:37:34.620 align:start position:0%
significant amount of even though no
 
05:37:36.708 --> 05:37:36.718 align:start position:0%
one's doing it to get rich they are you
 
05:37:37.910 --> 05:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
know the state is finished a different
 
05:37:39.650 --> 05:37:39.660 align:start position:0%
amount of money to care for the children
 
05:37:41.750 --> 05:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
and also uh
 
05:37:44.090 --> 05:37:44.100 align:start position:0%
and then also this bill aside from that
 
05:37:46.250 --> 05:37:46.260 align:start position:0%
too it's I think it appears to be poorly
 
05:37:47.868 --> 05:37:47.878 align:start position:0%
drafted so that's the second reason not
 
05:37:49.970 --> 05:37:49.980 align:start position:0%
to pass it so I would urge you to to itl
 
05:37:52.190 --> 05:37:52.200 align:start position:0%
it so thank you and thank you uh
 
05:37:54.288 --> 05:37:54.298 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative Leon thank
 
05:37:56.030 --> 05:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
05:37:57.948 --> 05:37:57.958 align:start position:0%
representative for speaking
 
05:38:00.170 --> 05:38:00.180 align:start position:0%
um my question is this applies to those
 
05:38:02.150 --> 05:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
children who are opening up their home
 
05:38:03.948 --> 05:38:03.958 align:start position:0%
and their parents to other kids who are
 
05:38:05.868 --> 05:38:05.878 align:start position:0%
in need do you think that those kids who
 
05:38:07.788 --> 05:38:07.798 align:start position:0%
are already sacrificing so much don't
 
05:38:09.350 --> 05:38:09.360 align:start position:0%
deserve the same protections as other
 
05:38:11.690 --> 05:38:11.700 align:start position:0%
kids in the state
 
05:38:14.090 --> 05:38:14.100 align:start position:0%
um well that's uh that's fair enough
 
05:38:16.310 --> 05:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
that the uh the family should be subject
 
05:38:18.288 --> 05:38:18.298 align:start position:0%
to the same requirement yeah but there
 
05:38:20.030 --> 05:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
should be a requirement for uh for
 
05:38:22.670 --> 05:38:22.680 align:start position:0%
foster families they certainly uh the
 
05:38:24.830 --> 05:38:24.840 align:start position:0%
Foster family is doing a very Noble deed
 
05:38:26.150 --> 05:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't necessarily give them
 
05:38:28.310 --> 05:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
the right to endanger the foster
 
05:38:31.190 --> 05:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
children and so
 
05:38:34.730 --> 05:38:34.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:36.590 --> 05:38:36.600 align:start position:0%
representative Missouri thank you Mr
 
05:38:38.150 --> 05:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
chair thanks for taking my question and
 
05:38:39.830 --> 05:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
maybe this was asked earlier I'm sorry I
 
05:38:41.868 --> 05:38:41.878 align:start position:0%
came in a little bit late but so our
 
05:38:44.810 --> 05:38:44.820 align:start position:0%
foster parents required to be vaccinated
 
05:38:46.368 --> 05:38:46.378 align:start position:0%
right now
 
05:38:48.770 --> 05:38:48.780 align:start position:0%
that's that's a good question I do not
 
05:38:50.570 --> 05:38:50.580 align:start position:0%
know I mean there's a very
 
05:38:53.810 --> 05:38:53.820 align:start position:0%
detailed list of uh requirements for the
 
05:38:55.010 --> 05:38:55.020 align:start position:0%
home and that would I mean that would
 
05:38:57.170 --> 05:38:57.180 align:start position:0%
not be an unreasonable unreasonable
 
05:38:58.610 --> 05:38:58.620 align:start position:0%
requirement and there could be
 
05:39:00.170 --> 05:39:00.180 align:start position:0%
exemptions for religious or health
 
05:39:02.690 --> 05:39:02.700 align:start position:0%
reasons so that you that's a question
 
05:39:04.430 --> 05:39:04.440 align:start position:0%
you have to direct at someone else I'm
 
05:39:06.590 --> 05:39:06.600 align:start position:0%
afraid so I can try to find out if you
 
05:39:08.090 --> 05:39:08.100 align:start position:0%
want to but thanks
 
05:39:11.030 --> 05:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:16.310 --> 05:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:17.810 --> 05:39:17.820 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is
 
05:39:28.250 --> 05:39:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:30.350 --> 05:39:30.360 align:start position:0%
only Phillips representing Rockingham 7
 
05:39:32.150 --> 05:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
Fremont New Hampshire I wasn't
 
05:39:33.470 --> 05:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
originally going to speak on this but I
 
05:39:36.230 --> 05:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
thought it was very important to
 
05:39:38.270 --> 05:39:38.280 align:start position:0%
um point out that this is just
 
05:39:39.830 --> 05:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
discrimination we're treating Children
 
05:39:41.628 --> 05:39:41.638 align:start position:0%
and Families differently if they're in
 
05:39:44.510 --> 05:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
the Foster system and there's
 
05:39:44.520 --> 05:39:45.170 align:start position:0%
the Foster system and there's
um

05:39:45.170 --> 05:39:45.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:39:47.270 --> 05:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
from what I do understand is that they
 
05:39:49.550 --> 05:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
are required the foster parents and
 
05:39:51.530 --> 05:39:51.540 align:start position:0%
Foster families are required to do the
 
05:39:54.770 --> 05:39:54.780 align:start position:0%
full CDC schedule all of it so I just
 
05:39:56.090 --> 05:39:56.100 align:start position:0%
don't even understand why this law even
 
05:39:58.430 --> 05:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
exists discriminatory and like someone
 
05:40:00.050 --> 05:40:00.060 align:start position:0%
else said we have a shortage of foster
 
05:40:02.090 --> 05:40:02.100 align:start position:0%
families um I myself would love to
 
05:40:03.650 --> 05:40:03.660 align:start position:0%
welcome a foster child but I'm not
 
05:40:06.410 --> 05:40:06.420 align:start position:0%
willing to comply with the requirement
 
05:40:08.330 --> 05:40:08.340 align:start position:0%
so why would we be deterring people from
 
05:40:10.250 --> 05:40:10.260 align:start position:0%
opening their homes to children I just
 
05:40:11.628 --> 05:40:11.638 align:start position:0%
don't understand it I'll answer
 
05:40:12.948 --> 05:40:12.958 align:start position:0%
questions but
 
05:40:14.690 --> 05:40:14.700 align:start position:0%
representative King
 
05:40:16.310 --> 05:40:16.320 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman McDonald thank you
 
05:40:18.590 --> 05:40:18.600 align:start position:0%
for taking questions
 
05:40:20.390 --> 05:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
um I'm glad that you noted that there
 
05:40:24.128 --> 05:40:24.138 align:start position:0%
are an under supply of foster homes
 
05:40:27.770 --> 05:40:27.780 align:start position:0%
where are children who would be in the
 
05:40:29.930 --> 05:40:29.940 align:start position:0%
foster care system where where are they
 
05:40:31.788 --> 05:40:31.798 align:start position:0%
currently if they're not where we want
 
05:40:33.350 --> 05:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
them to be which is in foster home what
 
05:40:36.830 --> 05:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
happens to them do you know I am I am no
 
05:40:39.410 --> 05:40:39.420 align:start position:0%
Foster expert I don't know but I would
 
05:40:41.330 --> 05:40:41.340 align:start position:0%
assume I I would assume they're in other
 
05:40:43.128 --> 05:40:43.138 align:start position:0%
foster homes that maybe don't have their
 
05:40:44.390 --> 05:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
own maybe someone else can answer that
 
05:40:46.730 --> 05:40:46.740 align:start position:0%
question but
 
05:40:46.740 --> 05:40:48.230 align:start position:0%
question but
doesn't

05:40:48.230 --> 05:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
05:40:50.690 --> 05:40:50.700 align:start position:0%
nobody has the answer but we have we
 
05:40:53.030 --> 05:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
definitely have kids who need homes
 
05:40:55.550 --> 05:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
05:41:00.288 --> 05:41:00.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:02.810 --> 05:41:02.820 align:start position:0%
awesome one more
 
05:41:04.970 --> 05:41:04.980 align:start position:0%
also signed up to testify is Melissa
 
05:41:15.970 --> 05:41:15.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:19.190 --> 05:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
hi thank you again um I do support this
 
05:41:21.170 --> 05:41:21.180 align:start position:0%
bill I think I forgot to say that the
 
05:41:23.690 --> 05:41:23.700 align:start position:0%
last time I spoke but um so I'm I'm a
 
05:41:26.270 --> 05:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
mom I'm not a doctor but um I can read
 
05:41:28.910 --> 05:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
and I can understand conversations with
 
05:41:28.920 --> 05:41:30.288 align:start position:0%
and I can understand conversations with
doctors

05:41:30.288 --> 05:41:30.298 align:start position:0%
doctors
 
05:41:33.430 --> 05:41:33.440 align:start position:0%
um I just want to say that
 
05:41:36.250 --> 05:41:36.260 align:start position:0%
vaccination does not equal immunization
 
05:41:39.650 --> 05:41:39.660 align:start position:0%
so I've heard kind of hopefully it was a
 
05:41:42.050 --> 05:41:42.060 align:start position:0%
joke but um someone suggested that
 
05:41:44.330 --> 05:41:44.340 align:start position:0%
children who are unvaccinated are
 
05:41:46.850 --> 05:41:46.860 align:start position:0%
disease ridden and the gentleman a
 
05:41:46.860 --> 05:41:48.170 align:start position:0%
disease ridden and the gentleman a
couple

05:41:48.170 --> 05:41:48.180 align:start position:0%
couple
 
05:41:51.110 --> 05:41:51.120 align:start position:0%
testimonies before suggested that
 
05:41:53.270 --> 05:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
um you know the the children that were
 
05:41:56.510 --> 05:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
we would be endangering children by
 
05:41:58.788 --> 05:41:58.798 align:start position:0%
allowing them to be around unvaccinated
 
05:41:58.798 --> 05:42:00.170 align:start position:0%
allowing them to be around unvaccinated
children

05:42:00.170 --> 05:42:00.180 align:start position:0%
children
 
05:42:04.610 --> 05:42:04.620 align:start position:0%
um but I I really want to suggest to the
 
05:42:05.810 --> 05:42:05.820 align:start position:0%
to the
 
05:42:07.910 --> 05:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
committee that um
 
05:42:10.368 --> 05:42:10.378 align:start position:0%
you know there's a couple great studies
 
05:42:12.050 --> 05:42:12.060 align:start position:0%
out there comparing unvaccinated
 
05:42:14.270 --> 05:42:14.280 align:start position:0%
children to vaccinated children and
 
05:42:16.368 --> 05:42:16.378 align:start position:0%
partially partially vaccinated and fully
 
05:42:19.490 --> 05:42:19.500 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and the children who are
 
05:42:23.090 --> 05:42:23.100 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated are exponentially healthier
 
05:42:25.190 --> 05:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
than the children who are vaccinated I
 
05:42:26.590 --> 05:42:26.600 align:start position:0%
know that's not the purpose of this
 
05:42:29.930 --> 05:42:29.940 align:start position:0%
hearing today but um it's something that
 
05:42:32.330 --> 05:42:32.340 align:start position:0%
we need to take into consideration and
 
05:42:32.340 --> 05:42:32.990 align:start position:0%
we need to take into consideration and
um

05:42:32.990 --> 05:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:42:34.910 --> 05:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
if you look around at today's children
 
05:42:37.250 --> 05:42:37.260 align:start position:0%
they're very very ill they're
 
05:42:39.470 --> 05:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
chronically ill not not sick with
 
05:42:42.410 --> 05:42:42.420 align:start position:0%
measles but they have everything else so
 
05:42:45.110 --> 05:42:45.120 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry again if I'm
 
05:42:47.090 --> 05:42:47.100 align:start position:0%
stepping out outside the bounds of the
 
05:42:49.730 --> 05:42:49.740 align:start position:0%
hearing but I just needed to to say that
 
05:42:54.650 --> 05:42:54.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:57.590 --> 05:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
also signed up to testify is Ann Marie
 
05:42:59.330 --> 05:42:59.340 align:start position:0%
McCurry from the Department of Health
 
05:43:05.868 --> 05:43:05.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:07.910 --> 05:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chair my name is Abby Rogers I'm the
 
05:43:09.530 --> 05:43:09.540 align:start position:0%
legislative liaison for the division of
 
05:43:11.510 --> 05:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
Public Health Services I'm here with
 
05:43:13.310 --> 05:43:13.320 align:start position:0%
Anne-Marie Mercury who's a section chief
 
05:43:15.410 --> 05:43:15.420 align:start position:0%
for immunization we're here to support
 
05:43:17.570 --> 05:43:17.580 align:start position:0%
our colleague from dcyf with any
 
05:43:19.550 --> 05:43:19.560 align:start position:0%
vaccination immunization related
 
05:43:21.350 --> 05:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
questions that the kid midi may have
 
05:43:23.448 --> 05:43:23.458 align:start position:0%
speak specifically on those immunization
 
05:43:25.550 --> 05:43:25.560 align:start position:0%
questions if the committee if we can be
 
05:43:27.050 --> 05:43:27.060 align:start position:0%
a resource on any questions that were
 
05:43:28.850 --> 05:43:28.860 align:start position:0%
unanswered previously
 
05:43:28.860 --> 05:43:30.288 align:start position:0%
unanswered previously
okay

05:43:30.288 --> 05:43:30.298 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:43:33.530 --> 05:43:33.540 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative Shapiro
 
05:43:35.810 --> 05:43:35.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I've asked a few
 
05:43:37.430 --> 05:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
people this but I feel like I haven't
 
05:43:40.128 --> 05:43:40.138 align:start position:0%
gotten an answer I'm I'm wondering what
 
05:43:42.470 --> 05:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
the medical we've heard a lot about
 
05:43:45.230 --> 05:43:45.240 align:start position:0%
losing money we've heard a lot about how
 
05:43:48.110 --> 05:43:48.120 align:start position:0%
unfair this is but I still have don't
 
05:43:50.150 --> 05:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
think I've heard anything about the
 
05:43:53.930 --> 05:43:53.940 align:start position:0%
medical Public Health protective
 
05:43:56.448 --> 05:43:56.458 align:start position:0%
um intention of
 
05:43:59.030 --> 05:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
um having the children of foster parents
 
05:44:01.250 --> 05:44:01.260 align:start position:0%
have a greater number of vaccinations
 
05:44:03.230 --> 05:44:03.240 align:start position:0%
what do what do we
 
05:44:06.288 --> 05:44:06.298 align:start position:0%
what are we trying to do
 
05:44:08.208 --> 05:44:08.218 align:start position:0%
hello for the record in Murray McCurry
 
05:44:09.830 --> 05:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
immunization section chief thank you
 
05:44:11.930 --> 05:44:11.940 align:start position:0%
very much for the question
 
05:44:14.690 --> 05:44:14.700 align:start position:0%
um so we do want to be clear that um the
 
05:44:16.190 --> 05:44:16.200 align:start position:0%
Department of Public Health does not
 
05:44:18.948 --> 05:44:18.958 align:start position:0%
have the oversight of the administrative
 
05:44:22.610 --> 05:44:22.620 align:start position:0%
rules that are required for dcyf so um I
 
05:44:24.770 --> 05:44:24.780 align:start position:0%
do have a limited understanding it would
 
05:44:26.868 --> 05:44:26.878 align:start position:0%
rely on my dcif counterparts to answer
 
05:44:29.330 --> 05:44:29.340 align:start position:0%
some of these questions however you know
 
05:44:32.350 --> 05:44:32.360 align:start position:0%
as far as a medical necessity these are
 
05:44:35.330 --> 05:44:35.340 align:start position:0%
from what my understanding is is that is
 
05:44:37.430 --> 05:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
based on federal standards and National
 
05:44:40.490 --> 05:44:40.500 align:start position:0%
guidelines based on protecting the
 
05:44:42.170 --> 05:44:42.180 align:start position:0%
children who are coming into the Foster
 
05:44:44.868 --> 05:44:44.878 align:start position:0%
families these children do oftentimes
 
05:44:47.690 --> 05:44:47.700 align:start position:0%
have a lot more special needs medical
 
05:44:50.628 --> 05:44:50.638 align:start position:0%
conditions and offering a higher level
 
05:44:54.288 --> 05:44:54.298 align:start position:0%
of protection where they live is a
 
05:44:57.350 --> 05:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
rationale for why that would be I also
 
05:44:58.670 --> 05:44:58.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to be able to provide a little
 
05:45:00.110 --> 05:45:00.120 align:start position:0%
bit of clarification on some of the
 
05:45:02.628 --> 05:45:02.638 align:start position:0%
questions you posed earlier as far as
 
05:45:05.990 --> 05:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
the acip recommended vaccines there are
 
05:45:08.990 --> 05:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
17 acip recommended vaccines are in
 
05:45:12.350 --> 05:45:12.360 align:start position:0%
schedule for children up to age 18 for
 
05:45:14.208 --> 05:45:14.218 align:start position:0%
school immunization requirements which
 
05:45:16.250 --> 05:45:16.260 align:start position:0%
is what Dr Ben Chan was referring to
 
05:45:18.590 --> 05:45:18.600 align:start position:0%
earlier that do not include covet and
 
05:45:22.850 --> 05:45:22.860 align:start position:0%
influenza that covers 10 of the 17 acip
 
05:45:25.850 --> 05:45:25.860 align:start position:0%
recommended vaccines so there is a
 
05:45:27.830 --> 05:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
difference between what we see for what
 
05:45:29.628 --> 05:45:29.638 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has in place for school
 
05:45:32.270 --> 05:45:32.280 align:start position:0%
immunization requirements versus the
 
05:45:34.490 --> 05:45:34.500 align:start position:0%
dcyf requirements
 
05:45:37.910 --> 05:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
follow up so
 
05:45:41.150 --> 05:45:41.160 align:start position:0%
this may be outside of your area of
 
05:45:42.830 --> 05:45:42.840 align:start position:0%
expertise but
 
05:45:45.788 --> 05:45:45.798 align:start position:0%
could you give an example of
 
05:45:49.730 --> 05:45:49.740 align:start position:0%
what a under six-year-old or a young
 
05:45:52.070 --> 05:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
child with special Health needs
 
05:45:55.010 --> 05:45:55.020 align:start position:0%
might be specifically more vulnerable to
 
05:45:55.020 --> 05:45:56.510 align:start position:0%
might be specifically more vulnerable to
than

05:45:56.510 --> 05:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
than
 
05:45:58.850 --> 05:45:58.860 align:start position:0%
um than other kids that this vaccination
 
05:46:01.190 --> 05:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
would um
 
05:46:03.530 --> 05:46:03.540 align:start position:0%
sure would protect them from sure I can
 
05:46:05.390 --> 05:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
speak a little bit to that um sometimes
 
05:46:07.190 --> 05:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
I can just speak to some children have
 
05:46:09.830 --> 05:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
seizure disorders which is
 
05:46:11.750 --> 05:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
contraindicated for them to have for
 
05:46:13.548 --> 05:46:13.558 align:start position:0%
example pertussis which is part of the
 
05:46:16.368 --> 05:46:16.378 align:start position:0%
DPT that can exacerbate seizure
 
05:46:18.650 --> 05:46:18.660 align:start position:0%
disorders so many times and kids with
 
05:46:20.570 --> 05:46:20.580 align:start position:0%
children with seizure disorders the
 
05:46:22.070 --> 05:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
neurologist might say we'll give you the
 
05:46:23.810 --> 05:46:23.820 align:start position:0%
D and the T but leave the P out because
 
05:46:26.410 --> 05:46:26.420 align:start position:0%
that exacerbates
 
05:46:29.448 --> 05:46:29.458 align:start position:0%
that condition in in children some
 
05:46:30.590 --> 05:46:30.600 align:start position:0%
children who are being treated with
 
05:46:32.330 --> 05:46:32.340 align:start position:0%
cancer contraindicated to have certain
 
05:46:35.170 --> 05:46:35.180 align:start position:0%
vaccinations while undergoing treatment
 
05:46:37.310 --> 05:46:37.320 align:start position:0%
and you know mostly I think it's
 
05:46:38.810 --> 05:46:38.820 align:start position:0%
children that are affected with certain
 
05:46:41.750 --> 05:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
neurologic disorders but I I certainly
 
05:46:42.890 --> 05:46:42.900 align:start position:0%
don't have that much information but
 
05:46:45.350 --> 05:46:45.360 align:start position:0%
those are the two that I can provide I
 
05:46:46.610 --> 05:46:46.620 align:start position:0%
would also say that it's my
 
05:46:48.830 --> 05:46:48.840 align:start position:0%
understanding that some children and
 
05:46:50.990 --> 05:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
Beth can certainly clarify but some
 
05:46:52.930 --> 05:46:52.940 align:start position:0%
children do come to a foster family home
 
05:46:55.490 --> 05:46:55.500 align:start position:0%
mostly I think the goal is to be fully
 
05:46:57.350 --> 05:46:57.360 align:start position:0%
vaccinated but the only people that can
 
05:46:59.570 --> 05:46:59.580 align:start position:0%
make decisions on vaccination for the
 
05:47:00.948 --> 05:47:00.958 align:start position:0%
foster child are the parent and legal
 
05:47:02.390 --> 05:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
guardian and then sometimes perhaps
 
05:47:04.670 --> 05:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
those children are under vaccinated so
 
05:47:06.530 --> 05:47:06.540 align:start position:0%
having the Foster family had those
 
05:47:08.750 --> 05:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
vaccination Services of protection for
 
05:47:10.190 --> 05:47:10.200 align:start position:0%
that child if that child should be under
 
05:47:10.200 --> 05:47:12.110 align:start position:0%
that child if that child should be under
vaccinated

05:47:12.110 --> 05:47:12.120 align:start position:0%
vaccinated
 
05:47:14.150 --> 05:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
other questions thank you representative
 
05:47:14.160 --> 05:47:15.830 align:start position:0%
other questions thank you representative
Weber

05:47:15.830 --> 05:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
Weber
 
05:47:17.570 --> 05:47:17.580 align:start position:0%
and isn't it true I know this is not
 
05:47:20.150 --> 05:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
your specific area of
 
05:47:22.190 --> 05:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
practice or expertise but isn't it true
 
05:47:25.970 --> 05:47:25.980 align:start position:0%
that we require all sorts of extra
 
05:47:25.980 --> 05:47:28.310 align:start position:0%
that we require all sorts of extra
precautions

05:47:28.310 --> 05:47:28.320 align:start position:0%
precautions
 
05:47:30.770 --> 05:47:30.780 align:start position:0%
of families who are fostering other
 
05:47:33.070 --> 05:47:33.080 align:start position:0%
people's children
 
05:47:37.310 --> 05:47:37.320 align:start position:0%
for safety and other reasons we talk
 
05:47:40.548 --> 05:47:40.558 align:start position:0%
about fire exits we talk about all kinds
 
05:47:42.470 --> 05:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
of different safety measures in the home
 
05:47:44.690 --> 05:47:44.700 align:start position:0%
before somebody becomes licensed to be a
 
05:47:47.208 --> 05:47:47.218 align:start position:0%
foster care home
 
05:47:50.750 --> 05:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
um and this is strictly speaking because
 
05:47:52.730 --> 05:47:52.740 align:start position:0%
the first of all they're fostering
 
05:47:54.288 --> 05:47:54.298 align:start position:0%
somebody else's kid
 
05:47:57.530 --> 05:47:57.540 align:start position:0%
and secondly because
 
05:47:59.990 --> 05:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
um if something goes wrong in that home
 
05:48:01.788 --> 05:48:01.798 align:start position:0%
and we have seen that happen
 
05:48:06.170 --> 05:48:06.180 align:start position:0%
occasionally uh when the department gets
 
05:48:09.530 --> 05:48:09.540 align:start position:0%
it wrong whether with respect to a
 
05:48:11.510 --> 05:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
natural parent or a foster family or
 
05:48:14.930 --> 05:48:14.940 align:start position:0%
anybody else the consequences are very
 
05:48:14.940 --> 05:48:16.910 align:start position:0%
anybody else the consequences are very
severe

05:48:16.910 --> 05:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
severe
 
05:48:19.610 --> 05:48:19.620 align:start position:0%
yes I would agree that and certainly um
 
05:48:22.670 --> 05:48:22.680 align:start position:0%
as sort of the the state agency
 
05:48:25.010 --> 05:48:25.020 align:start position:0%
um that would would take basically over
 
05:48:27.350 --> 05:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
oversight over someone else's child has
 
05:48:28.910 --> 05:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
the responsibility to make sure that
 
05:48:30.350 --> 05:48:30.360 align:start position:0%
environment that they're placed in is
 
05:48:31.970 --> 05:48:31.980 align:start position:0%
meeting all the safety standards and
 
05:48:33.650 --> 05:48:33.660 align:start position:0%
that child is protected within that
 
05:48:33.660 --> 05:48:35.690 align:start position:0%
that child is protected within that
system

05:48:35.690 --> 05:48:35.700 align:start position:0%
system
 
05:48:38.208 --> 05:48:38.218 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you Mr
 
05:48:39.590 --> 05:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you very much for
 
05:48:40.548 --> 05:48:40.558 align:start position:0%
coming up
 
05:48:42.530 --> 05:48:42.540 align:start position:0%
um I have a question about the public
 
05:48:45.230 --> 05:48:45.240 align:start position:0%
health benefit of requiring just these
 
05:48:47.208 --> 05:48:47.218 align:start position:0%
children who are sharing their home to
 
05:48:50.510 --> 05:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
be vaccinated against rotavirus HPV and
 
05:48:53.690 --> 05:48:53.700 align:start position:0%
Dengue Fever especially when rotavirus
 
05:48:55.128 --> 05:48:55.138 align:start position:0%
is a third world disease that was
 
05:48:57.048 --> 05:48:57.058 align:start position:0%
included for financial reasons in our
 
05:48:57.058 --> 05:48:58.610 align:start position:0%
included for financial reasons in our
schedule

05:48:58.610 --> 05:48:58.620 align:start position:0%
schedule
 
05:49:00.530 --> 05:49:00.540 align:start position:0%
I think that's where we would rely on
 
05:49:03.288 --> 05:49:03.298 align:start position:0%
our dcy F counterparts to have these
 
05:49:06.010 --> 05:49:06.020 align:start position:0%
carve outs obviously there are things
 
05:49:09.350 --> 05:49:09.360 align:start position:0%
where especially where you say Dengue it
 
05:49:12.530 --> 05:49:12.540 align:start position:0%
we're not in an endemic state it is on
 
05:49:14.570 --> 05:49:14.580 align:start position:0%
the acip recommended it would make sense
 
05:49:16.250 --> 05:49:16.260 align:start position:0%
for these carve routes to take place
 
05:49:17.990 --> 05:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
where it's applicable
 
05:49:19.430 --> 05:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:49:21.110 --> 05:49:21.120 align:start position:0%
other questions representative King
 
05:49:22.910 --> 05:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman McDonald thank you
 
05:49:24.708 --> 05:49:24.718 align:start position:0%
for taking questions I know you were
 
05:49:27.170 --> 05:49:27.180 align:start position:0%
here mostly to talk about vaccines
 
05:49:27.180 --> 05:49:27.890 align:start position:0%
here mostly to talk about vaccines
um

05:49:27.890 --> 05:49:27.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:49:30.170 --> 05:49:30.180 align:start position:0%
I wish I had asked my question a long
 
05:49:32.510 --> 05:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
time ago to somebody else but I'm still
 
05:49:34.430 --> 05:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
hoping I can get an answer um do you
 
05:49:37.368 --> 05:49:37.378 align:start position:0%
know what happens to children that you
 
05:49:38.868 --> 05:49:38.878 align:start position:0%
know we're trying to get into a foster
 
05:49:40.430 --> 05:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
home but there's there's not enough
 
05:49:42.170 --> 05:49:42.180 align:start position:0%
Supply where where are they where are
 
05:49:43.548 --> 05:49:43.558 align:start position:0%
they living what's happening to them
 
05:49:45.350 --> 05:49:45.360 align:start position:0%
where what kind of situation are they
 
05:49:48.410 --> 05:49:48.420 align:start position:0%
currently in thank you
 
05:49:51.110 --> 05:49:51.120 align:start position:0%
I can ask my colleague Beth marginson to
 
05:49:52.730 --> 05:49:52.740 align:start position:0%
come back up and answer that question if
 
05:49:55.010 --> 05:49:55.020 align:start position:0%
that's appropriate that's out of not an
 
05:49:56.810 --> 05:49:56.820 align:start position:0%
under our purview
 
05:49:58.010 --> 05:49:58.020 align:start position:0%
would that be okay with the committee
 
05:49:59.270 --> 05:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
05:50:10.368 --> 05:50:10.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:11.930 --> 05:50:11.940 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
05:50:14.390 --> 05:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
um I mean we are we are making do as we
 
05:50:16.788 --> 05:50:16.798 align:start position:0%
can right now with the foster care with
 
05:50:19.430 --> 05:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
the foster home supply that we have but
 
05:50:21.650 --> 05:50:21.660 align:start position:0%
um obviously we're looking to expand the
 
05:50:24.350 --> 05:50:24.360 align:start position:0%
number of foster homes that we have
 
05:50:26.690 --> 05:50:26.700 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up can you just be a
 
05:50:28.010 --> 05:50:28.020 align:start position:0%
little bit more specific on what you
 
05:50:29.570 --> 05:50:29.580 align:start position:0%
mean by making do does that mean that
 
05:50:31.070 --> 05:50:31.080 align:start position:0%
the children are with their biological
 
05:50:32.990 --> 05:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
parents still and and we're trying to
 
05:50:34.190 --> 05:50:34.200 align:start position:0%
get them out of there or does that mean
 
05:50:36.288 --> 05:50:36.298 align:start position:0%
that they are living in another foster
 
05:50:38.030 --> 05:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
home a foster home that maybe you only
 
05:50:39.590 --> 05:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to have two foster children and
 
05:50:41.628 --> 05:50:41.638 align:start position:0%
now they've got five is that what you
 
05:50:43.368 --> 05:50:43.378 align:start position:0%
mean by making do or are they in like
 
05:50:46.250 --> 05:50:46.260 align:start position:0%
like a state like a state-run like
 
05:50:47.990 --> 05:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
facility I don't know what you mean by
 
05:50:50.090 --> 05:50:50.100 align:start position:0%
making do they're not at a state-run
 
05:50:50.100 --> 05:50:51.048 align:start position:0%
making do they're not at a state-run
facility

05:50:51.048 --> 05:50:51.058 align:start position:0%
facility
 
05:50:52.250 --> 05:50:52.260 align:start position:0%
um they're not with their biological
 
05:50:54.350 --> 05:50:54.360 align:start position:0%
children if it has been determined that
 
05:50:57.470 --> 05:50:57.480 align:start position:0%
is necessary for them to remove them our
 
05:51:00.048 --> 05:51:00.058 align:start position:0%
foster homes are allowed to have six are
 
05:51:03.368 --> 05:51:03.378 align:start position:0%
allowed to have six children in it
 
05:51:05.448 --> 05:51:05.458 align:start position:0%
representative McLean
 
05:51:07.070 --> 05:51:07.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
05:51:09.048 --> 05:51:09.058 align:start position:0%
taking my question so
 
05:51:11.990 --> 05:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
um we talk a lot about uh the deficit of
 
05:51:15.350 --> 05:51:15.360 align:start position:0%
foster families so I question you know
 
05:51:18.048 --> 05:51:18.058 align:start position:0%
given that situation you know is it
 
05:51:21.948 --> 05:51:21.958 align:start position:0%
necessarily good public policy to have a
 
05:51:24.590 --> 05:51:24.600 align:start position:0%
blanket vaccination instead of uh you
 
05:51:26.330 --> 05:51:26.340 align:start position:0%
know maybe certain people would maybe
 
05:51:28.128 --> 05:51:28.138 align:start position:0%
certain people wouldn't if this
 
05:51:31.548 --> 05:51:31.558 align:start position:0%
legislation were to pass
 
05:51:34.628 --> 05:51:34.638 align:start position:0%
um would there be anything that would
 
05:51:37.788 --> 05:51:37.798 align:start position:0%
prevent uh the department from saying
 
05:51:39.830 --> 05:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
you know because we have these children
 
05:51:42.110 --> 05:51:42.120 align:start position:0%
specifically in their immunocompromised
 
05:51:43.390 --> 05:51:43.400 align:start position:0%
in this area
 
05:51:46.430 --> 05:51:46.440 align:start position:0%
we would need those foster families to
 
05:51:48.590 --> 05:51:48.600 align:start position:0%
be immunized here or there
 
05:51:50.270 --> 05:51:50.280 align:start position:0%
um you know but not such a blanket
 
05:51:52.730 --> 05:51:52.740 align:start position:0%
approach if this was to pass yes there's
 
05:51:57.110 --> 05:51:57.120 align:start position:0%
so in the in the national standards for
 
05:51:57.120 --> 05:51:58.070 align:start position:0%
so in the in the national standards for
instance

05:51:58.070 --> 05:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
instance
 
05:52:00.650 --> 05:52:00.660 align:start position:0%
um medically needy children cannot be
 
05:52:02.390 --> 05:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
with unvaccinated adults against
 
05:52:05.330 --> 05:52:05.340 align:start position:0%
whooping cough so that would be that
 
05:52:07.128 --> 05:52:07.138 align:start position:0%
would be uh something that would concern
 
05:52:09.410 --> 05:52:09.420 align:start position:0%
at the end of that we could not place a
 
05:52:11.990 --> 05:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
child in a home
 
05:52:13.310 --> 05:52:13.320 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
05:52:15.650 --> 05:52:15.660 align:start position:0%
so just to clarify so if this was to
 
05:52:19.128 --> 05:52:19.138 align:start position:0%
pass you would still have flexibility
 
05:52:20.948 --> 05:52:20.958 align:start position:0%
for those children in our
 
05:52:22.910 --> 05:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
immunocompromise to still be able to go
 
05:52:25.368 --> 05:52:25.378 align:start position:0%
to those parents and say yes we do
 
05:52:27.590 --> 05:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
require this in your case no we couldn't
 
05:52:29.208 --> 05:52:29.218 align:start position:0%
because as I just read the amendment
 
05:52:31.730 --> 05:52:31.740 align:start position:0%
it's saying that nobody no there shall
 
05:52:33.530 --> 05:52:33.540 align:start position:0%
be no requirements of any adults in the
 
05:52:36.288 --> 05:52:36.298 align:start position:0%
home and currently I don't believe I'm a
 
05:52:38.448 --> 05:52:38.458 align:start position:0%
little at lost because the the foster
 
05:52:41.570 --> 05:52:41.580 align:start position:0%
care sort of expert had pre-approved
 
05:52:43.430 --> 05:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
leave today so she couldn't be here so
 
05:52:44.810 --> 05:52:44.820 align:start position:0%
you know we will certainly take
 
05:52:47.510 --> 05:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
follow-up questions by email if that's
 
05:52:49.128 --> 05:52:49.138 align:start position:0%
appropriate but
 
05:52:53.030 --> 05:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:54.708 --> 05:52:54.718 align:start position:0%
just kind of lost with my train of
 
05:52:59.510 --> 05:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
thought sorry about that but the um
 
05:53:02.270 --> 05:53:02.280 align:start position:0%
if the amended version of this bill
 
05:53:05.390 --> 05:53:05.400 align:start position:0%
would re would uh mandate that no adult
 
05:53:07.128 --> 05:53:07.138 align:start position:0%
in the home would require to be
 
05:53:10.310 --> 05:53:10.320 align:start position:0%
vaccinated if that were to pass then we
 
05:53:13.670 --> 05:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
would not be able to require any any
 
05:53:15.770 --> 05:53:15.780 align:start position:0%
adults to be vaccinated against whooping
 
05:53:17.390 --> 05:53:17.400 align:start position:0%
cough and we would have a problem with
 
05:53:20.390 --> 05:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
placing medically needy children
 
05:53:22.190 --> 05:53:22.200 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman
 
05:53:24.708 --> 05:53:24.718 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and uh thank you
 
05:53:27.530 --> 05:53:27.540 align:start position:0%
for coming up uh can a child be placed
 
05:53:30.890 --> 05:53:30.900 align:start position:0%
with extended family if like in a
 
05:53:33.770 --> 05:53:33.780 align:start position:0%
temporary foster situation if those
 
05:53:36.230 --> 05:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
family members and the children in that
 
05:53:38.330 --> 05:53:38.340 align:start position:0%
home are not vaccinated on the CDC
 
05:53:40.670 --> 05:53:40.680 align:start position:0%
schedule does that does the rule
 
05:53:42.890 --> 05:53:42.900 align:start position:0%
currently in place prevent that no it
 
05:53:44.990 --> 05:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
does not and in fact the division first
 
05:53:46.788 --> 05:53:46.798 align:start position:0%
looks to family members to place
 
05:53:48.708 --> 05:53:48.718 align:start position:0%
children prior to putting putting them
 
05:53:51.350 --> 05:53:51.360 align:start position:0%
in the foster home follow-up follow-up
 
05:53:54.708 --> 05:53:54.718 align:start position:0%
so just just clarify so extended family
 
05:53:58.070 --> 05:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
are exempt from this requirement yes
 
05:53:59.690 --> 05:53:59.700 align:start position:0%
because they're not licensed foster
 
05:54:01.368 --> 05:54:01.378 align:start position:0%
homes thank you
 
05:54:03.770 --> 05:54:03.780 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
05:54:05.570 --> 05:54:05.580 align:start position:0%
thank you and to go back to the very
 
05:54:06.890 --> 05:54:06.900 align:start position:0%
beginning when we were talking about
 
05:54:08.628 --> 05:54:08.638 align:start position:0%
making do
 
05:54:08.638 --> 05:54:10.368 align:start position:0%
making do
isn't

05:54:10.368 --> 05:54:10.378 align:start position:0%
isn't
 
05:54:12.230 --> 05:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
part of what we're talking about when
 
05:54:14.448 --> 05:54:14.458 align:start position:0%
we're talking about making do
 
05:54:18.890 --> 05:54:18.900 align:start position:0%
is that what we would want for our
 
05:54:21.048 --> 05:54:21.058 align:start position:0%
foster children
 
05:54:25.610 --> 05:54:25.620 align:start position:0%
is to match the needs of that foster
 
05:54:28.368 --> 05:54:28.378 align:start position:0%
child as closely as we possibly can
 
05:54:30.548 --> 05:54:30.558 align:start position:0%
including things like
 
05:54:32.930 --> 05:54:32.940 align:start position:0%
keeping them in their same school
 
05:54:35.150 --> 05:54:35.160 align:start position:0%
district keeping them close to where
 
05:54:38.930 --> 05:54:38.940 align:start position:0%
their friends are and that that is one
 
05:54:41.030 --> 05:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
of the things that with the lack of
 
05:54:44.270 --> 05:54:44.280 align:start position:0%
foster parents sometimes a child who
 
05:54:46.850 --> 05:54:46.860 align:start position:0%
came into the Foster system from Keene
 
05:54:50.390 --> 05:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
is placed with somebody very far away in
 
05:54:52.788 --> 05:54:52.798 align:start position:0%
the state yes that can't happen thank
 
05:54:55.670 --> 05:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
you representative Leon thank you very
 
05:54:57.288 --> 05:54:57.298 align:start position:0%
much Mr chairman thank you right over
 
05:54:57.298 --> 05:54:58.030 align:start position:0%
much Mr chairman thank you right over
here

05:54:58.030 --> 05:54:58.040 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:55:00.948 --> 05:55:00.958 align:start position:0%
that the definition of medically needed
 
05:55:02.690 --> 05:55:02.700 align:start position:0%
child do you know specifically what that
 
05:55:04.548 --> 05:55:04.558 align:start position:0%
is because that might be an important
 
05:55:05.990 --> 05:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
touch Point here and if you don't would
 
05:55:08.690 --> 05:55:08.700 align:start position:0%
you mind sending that to us I don't um
 
05:55:11.150 --> 05:55:11.160 align:start position:0%
it may be I think perhaps the public
 
05:55:12.410 --> 05:55:12.420 align:start position:0%
health people might be able to answer
 
05:55:14.448 --> 05:55:14.458 align:start position:0%
that but I cannot answer that now thank
 
05:55:16.670 --> 05:55:16.680 align:start position:0%
you yeah keeping these kids as close to
 
05:55:17.868 --> 05:55:17.878 align:start position:0%
home and in their schools is good
 
05:55:21.830 --> 05:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you any other questions
 
05:55:23.868 --> 05:55:23.878 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant
 
05:55:25.970 --> 05:55:25.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
05:55:28.670 --> 05:55:28.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question we heard earlier at
 
05:55:31.548 --> 05:55:31.558 align:start position:0%
least I thought he did about the impact
 
05:55:34.788 --> 05:55:34.798 align:start position:0%
this has had on Foster families
 
05:55:36.948 --> 05:55:36.958 align:start position:0%
and then exiting if you will providing
 
05:55:38.628 --> 05:55:38.638 align:start position:0%
that kind of care
 
05:55:41.270 --> 05:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
is this going to bypassing this all of a
 
05:55:42.590 --> 05:55:42.600 align:start position:0%
sudden open the floodgates are going to
 
05:55:43.730 --> 05:55:43.740 align:start position:0%
have lots of people who want to be
 
05:55:44.990 --> 05:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
foster parents because they don't have
 
05:55:46.670 --> 05:55:46.680 align:start position:0%
to worry about vaccines or basically are
 
05:55:48.590 --> 05:55:48.600 align:start position:0%
we just looking at something that really
 
05:55:49.910 --> 05:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist
 
05:55:52.010 --> 05:55:52.020 align:start position:0%
so in other words a solution to a
 
05:55:54.590 --> 05:55:54.600 align:start position:0%
problem or something my guess my
 
05:55:56.990 --> 05:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
question yes is is this a solution to a
 
05:55:58.430 --> 05:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
problem that exists or a problem looking
 
05:56:01.610 --> 05:56:01.620 align:start position:0%
for a solution we have not I have not
 
05:56:03.310 --> 05:56:03.320 align:start position:0%
extensively with our foster care
 
05:56:06.110 --> 05:56:06.120 align:start position:0%
licensing program but I am not aware
 
05:56:09.048 --> 05:56:09.058 align:start position:0%
that the vaccination requirements for uh
 
05:56:12.948 --> 05:56:12.958 align:start position:0%
for our foster homes are problematic
 
05:56:16.368 --> 05:56:16.378 align:start position:0%
did I see another hand up down here
 
05:56:18.530 --> 05:56:18.540 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
05:56:20.330 --> 05:56:20.340 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much okay
 
05:56:22.670 --> 05:56:22.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:56:25.250 --> 05:56:25.260 align:start position:0%
no one else has signed up to testify on
 
05:56:28.670 --> 05:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
this bill uh House Bill 408 has anyone
 
05:56:30.410 --> 05:56:30.420 align:start position:0%
else wish to testify
 
05:56:32.150 --> 05:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
seeing no one I'm going to close the
 
05:56:34.670 --> 05:56:34.680 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill 408 and
 
05:56:37.548 --> 05:56:37.558 align:start position:0%
open the public hearing on 217 and
 
05:56:40.010 --> 05:56:40.020 align:start position:0%
recognize representative Schmidt who is
 
05:56:52.850 --> 05:56:52.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:55.610 --> 05:56:55.620 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman for the
 
05:56:57.470 --> 05:56:57.480 align:start position:0%
record my name is Peter Schmidt I
 
05:56:59.930 --> 05:56:59.940 align:start position:0%
represent Dover award one
 
05:57:04.128 --> 05:57:04.138 align:start position:0%
Stratford Stratford County 14.
 
05:57:07.250 --> 05:57:07.260 align:start position:0%
um so uh I appreciate the opportunity to
 
05:57:09.110 --> 05:57:09.120 align:start position:0%
be before Health and Human Services
 
05:57:11.628 --> 05:57:11.638 align:start position:0%
committee which is a rare opportunity
 
05:57:14.750 --> 05:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
for me but but this is a matter that I
 
05:57:21.850 --> 05:57:21.860 align:start position:0%
am not a newly arrived at uh I first um
 
05:57:23.990 --> 05:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
encountered the subject of water
 
05:57:26.208 --> 05:57:26.218 align:start position:0%
fluoridation probably something like 50
 
05:57:29.570 --> 05:57:29.580 align:start position:0%
years ago when I read an article in a in
 
05:57:32.030 --> 05:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
a some kind of a journal that prompt me
 
05:57:34.190 --> 05:57:34.200 align:start position:0%
to think at some point I'm going to have
 
05:57:35.690 --> 05:57:35.700 align:start position:0%
to look into this because I found it
 
05:57:37.250 --> 05:57:37.260 align:start position:0%
quite troubling
 
05:57:37.260 --> 05:57:38.090 align:start position:0%
quite troubling
um

05:57:38.090 --> 05:57:38.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:57:40.548 --> 05:57:40.558 align:start position:0%
and that opportunity presented itself
 
05:57:42.948 --> 05:57:42.958 align:start position:0%
about 18 years ago when I was on the
 
05:57:44.150 --> 05:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
municipal and Colony government
 
05:57:47.448 --> 05:57:47.458 align:start position:0%
committee and there was a bill uh that
 
05:57:49.670 --> 05:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
involved permitting the city of
 
05:57:53.750 --> 05:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
Manchester to re-uh uh conduct a
 
05:57:56.208 --> 05:57:56.218 align:start position:0%
plebiscite involving the city of
 
05:57:59.990 --> 05:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
Manchester's water supply but was also
 
05:58:04.310 --> 05:58:04.320 align:start position:0%
water supply for the surrounding collar
 
05:58:06.770 --> 05:58:06.780 align:start position:0%
communities of it if you will and there
 
05:58:08.990 --> 05:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
had been a lawsuit challenging the
 
05:58:11.150 --> 05:58:11.160 align:start position:0%
plebiscite that had been held previously
 
05:58:14.510 --> 05:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
which had narrowly permitted water
 
05:58:16.548 --> 05:58:16.558 align:start position:0%
fluoridation for the city of Manchester
 
05:58:19.730 --> 05:58:19.740 align:start position:0%
and the suit said but you didn't include
 
05:58:23.690 --> 05:58:23.700 align:start position:0%
a question or election or plebiscite for
 
05:58:25.670 --> 05:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
the surrounding communities and
 
05:58:27.650 --> 05:58:27.660 align:start position:0%
therefore they're being supplied water
 
05:58:31.128 --> 05:58:31.138 align:start position:0%
with uh that's fluoridated and they
 
05:58:33.708 --> 05:58:33.718 align:start position:0%
didn't have any say in that so the court
 
05:58:35.990 --> 05:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
decided they were correct and there had
 
05:58:38.690 --> 05:58:38.700 align:start position:0%
to be a a new plebiscite and involving
 
05:58:41.448 --> 05:58:41.458 align:start position:0%
all the people who were consuming the
 
05:58:43.810 --> 05:58:43.820 align:start position:0%
city of Manchester Water
 
05:58:47.930 --> 05:58:47.940 align:start position:0%
and the people who came in to testify on
 
05:58:50.510 --> 05:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
that bill were men most of them were
 
05:58:52.190 --> 05:58:52.200 align:start position:0%
very passionately opposed to water
 
05:58:52.200 --> 05:58:53.628 align:start position:0%
very passionately opposed to water
fluoridation

05:58:53.628 --> 05:58:53.638 align:start position:0%
fluoridation
 
05:58:55.670 --> 05:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
I I didn't know anything really about
 
05:58:57.708 --> 05:58:57.718 align:start position:0%
the subject at the time except what the
 
05:59:02.208 --> 05:59:02.218 align:start position:0%
average citizen does and uh so I saw a
 
05:59:03.288 --> 05:59:03.298 align:start position:0%
lot of people who had a lot of
 
05:59:05.150 --> 05:59:05.160 align:start position:0%
information and I started reading up on
 
05:59:08.390 --> 05:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
it I'm still very troubled by the idea
 
05:59:12.288 --> 05:59:12.298 align:start position:0%
of water fluoridation in terms of its
 
05:59:15.350 --> 05:59:15.360 align:start position:0%
possible impact on people's health and
 
05:59:18.490 --> 05:59:18.500 align:start position:0%
its efficacy and its safety
 
05:59:22.190 --> 05:59:22.200 align:start position:0%
so uh I've I've brought you this bill
 
05:59:26.650 --> 05:59:26.660 align:start position:0%
because there are several new studies
 
05:59:29.930 --> 05:59:29.940 align:start position:0%
that are of high value as I understand
 
05:59:34.128 --> 05:59:34.138 align:start position:0%
it's uh they are funded by the EPA and
 
05:59:36.048 --> 05:59:36.058 align:start position:0%
so forth I'm not going to talk about
 
05:59:39.350 --> 05:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
that because we I have people here who
 
05:59:41.570 --> 05:59:41.580 align:start position:0%
are very much more knowledgeable and
 
05:59:43.430 --> 05:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
some of them have even been involved I
 
05:59:45.890 --> 05:59:45.900 align:start position:0%
believe but I'll conclude my remarks
 
05:59:50.030 --> 05:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
with one final thing and that is that
 
05:59:50.040 --> 05:59:52.070 align:start position:0%
with one final thing and that is that
um

05:59:52.070 --> 05:59:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:52.080 --> 05:59:53.570 align:start position:0%
 
yep

05:59:53.570 --> 05:59:53.580 align:start position:0%
yep
 
05:59:56.390 --> 05:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
the perfect Bill senior moment has just
 
05:59:59.208 --> 05:59:59.218 align:start position:0%
struck uh that that's what happens when
 
06:00:02.330 --> 06:00:02.340 align:start position:0%
you get to be my age sometimes you're
 
06:00:04.430 --> 06:00:04.440 align:start position:0%
lucky if you can find certain body parts
 
06:00:07.788 --> 06:00:07.798 align:start position:0%
in the morning uh so uh the thing is
 
06:00:07.798 --> 06:00:08.990 align:start position:0%
in the morning uh so uh the thing is
that

06:00:08.990 --> 06:00:09.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:00:13.670 --> 06:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
um that this this this question is one
 
06:00:16.610 --> 06:00:16.620 align:start position:0%
of considerable urgency uh and and I
 
06:00:18.350 --> 06:00:18.360 align:start position:0%
hope you will look at it carefully and
 
06:00:20.810 --> 06:00:20.820 align:start position:0%
and ask questions oh I remember what I
 
06:00:22.610 --> 06:00:22.620 align:start position:0%
was going to tell you I believe that the
 
06:00:24.708 --> 06:00:24.718 align:start position:0%
committee has been provided a wealth of
 
06:00:27.650 --> 06:00:27.660 align:start position:0%
information by email uh that you should
 
06:00:31.010 --> 06:00:31.020 align:start position:0%
have all received quite recently that
 
06:00:33.708 --> 06:00:33.718 align:start position:0%
that I urge you to read I I've read some
 
06:00:36.350 --> 06:00:36.360 align:start position:0%
of it and I find it equally troubling so
 
06:00:38.330 --> 06:00:38.340 align:start position:0%
if there are any questions I'll try to
 
06:00:40.310 --> 06:00:40.320 align:start position:0%
answer but I think it's much better to
 
06:00:43.070 --> 06:00:43.080 align:start position:0%
hear from the experts behind me
 
06:00:45.708 --> 06:00:45.718 align:start position:0%
yeah yes representative Cushman
 
06:00:48.230 --> 06:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you representative for
 
06:00:49.910 --> 06:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
bringing this bill
 
06:00:51.470 --> 06:00:51.480 align:start position:0%
um on the subject of infants and
 
06:00:53.690 --> 06:00:53.700 align:start position:0%
children if I recall correctly because I
 
06:00:56.330 --> 06:00:56.340 align:start position:0%
brought a bill about fluoride before
 
06:00:59.150 --> 06:00:59.160 align:start position:0%
um if I recall correctly there there was
 
06:01:01.128 --> 06:01:01.138 align:start position:0%
something in New Hampshire statute that
 
06:01:03.890 --> 06:01:03.900 align:start position:0%
required a warning on municipality
 
06:01:07.750 --> 06:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
website if they had Municipal Water
 
06:01:11.150 --> 06:01:11.160 align:start position:0%
advising parents not to reconstitute for
 
06:01:15.850 --> 06:01:15.860 align:start position:0%
baby formula with fluoride due to the
 
06:01:18.170 --> 06:01:18.180 align:start position:0%
health issues associated do you remember
 
06:01:21.048 --> 06:01:21.058 align:start position:0%
that I do not
 
06:01:22.490 --> 06:01:22.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:01:24.230 --> 06:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
06:01:27.650 --> 06:01:27.660 align:start position:0%
yes representative navel thank you Mr
 
06:01:30.230 --> 06:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks for taking my question
 
06:01:32.810 --> 06:01:32.820 align:start position:0%
um this seems like a very big issue
 
06:01:35.090 --> 06:01:35.100 align:start position:0%
um that should not have escaped study in
 
06:01:36.530 --> 06:01:36.540 align:start position:0%
other states so there are other states
 
06:01:38.208 --> 06:01:38.218 align:start position:0%
other places that have looked at this
 
06:01:38.218 --> 06:01:39.410 align:start position:0%
other places that have looked at this
issue

06:01:39.410 --> 06:01:39.420 align:start position:0%
issue
 
06:01:41.990 --> 06:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh I would believe there are but I'm not
 
06:01:44.390 --> 06:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
Authority I've served 20 years in this
 
06:01:46.548 --> 06:01:46.558 align:start position:0%
legislature but I don't know that much
 
06:01:49.548 --> 06:01:49.558 align:start position:0%
about the rest of the nation
 
06:01:49.558 --> 06:01:52.070 align:start position:0%
about the rest of the nation
representative

06:01:52.070 --> 06:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:01:54.230 --> 06:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro thank you Mr
 
06:01:54.240 --> 06:01:55.670 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro thank you Mr
chairman

06:01:55.670 --> 06:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
06:01:58.128 --> 06:01:58.138 align:start position:0%
um representative
 
06:01:59.628 --> 06:01:59.638 align:start position:0%
um I know this is putting the cart
 
06:02:01.250 --> 06:02:01.260 align:start position:0%
before the horse because we're going to
 
06:02:03.230 --> 06:02:03.240 align:start position:0%
study this but I think the idea of these
 
06:02:04.910 --> 06:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
committees is frequently that
 
06:02:07.548 --> 06:02:07.558 align:start position:0%
legislation will be recommended so I'm
 
06:02:07.558 --> 06:02:09.548 align:start position:0%
legislation will be recommended so I'm
wondering

06:02:09.548 --> 06:02:09.558 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
06:02:11.990 --> 06:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
legislation I just want to make sure I'm
 
06:02:14.030 --> 06:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
here okay another one of the defects of
 
06:02:14.990 --> 06:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
old age
 
06:02:15.000 --> 06:02:17.868 align:start position:0%
old age
um

06:02:17.868 --> 06:02:17.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:21.890 --> 06:02:21.900 align:start position:0%
what What legislation do you think might
 
06:02:23.690 --> 06:02:23.700 align:start position:0%
come out of this
 
06:02:25.610 --> 06:02:25.620 align:start position:0%
well I don't want to project What
 
06:02:27.708 --> 06:02:27.718 align:start position:0%
legislation might come out of it but but
 
06:02:30.708 --> 06:02:30.718 align:start position:0%
I think if you look at lines uh 10
 
06:02:34.368 --> 06:02:34.378 align:start position:0%
through 20 the the the the bill which is
 
06:02:36.288 --> 06:02:36.298 align:start position:0%
very straightforward and simple which
 
06:02:38.150 --> 06:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
mostly said just sets up the study
 
06:02:40.970 --> 06:02:40.980 align:start position:0%
committee but it it's specifically that
 
06:02:42.830 --> 06:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
directs that the committee shall study
 
06:02:44.930 --> 06:02:44.940 align:start position:0%
the effects of fluoride exposure
 
06:02:46.970 --> 06:02:46.980 align:start position:0%
including neurotoxicity and other
 
06:02:49.368 --> 06:02:49.378 align:start position:0%
potential side effects on fetuses
 
06:02:51.470 --> 06:02:51.480 align:start position:0%
Children and adolescents and then it
 
06:02:54.470 --> 06:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
gives some some additional specifics uh
 
06:02:56.270 --> 06:02:56.280 align:start position:0%
and and I think that whatever
 
06:02:58.730 --> 06:02:58.740 align:start position:0%
legislation might come out of it should
 
06:03:01.610 --> 06:03:01.620 align:start position:0%
be dictated by what the what the latest
 
06:03:05.150 --> 06:03:05.160 align:start position:0%
and best science uh would uh would
 
06:03:07.368 --> 06:03:07.378 align:start position:0%
suggest that that we do with regard to
 
06:03:10.510 --> 06:03:10.520 align:start position:0%
the fact that water fluoridation I I I
 
06:03:14.030 --> 06:03:14.040 align:start position:0%
let me just say one thing there's a lot
 
06:03:15.770 --> 06:03:15.780 align:start position:0%
of fluoride available in fluoride
 
06:03:15.780 --> 06:03:17.030 align:start position:0%
of fluoride available in fluoride
toothpaste

06:03:17.030 --> 06:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
toothpaste
 
06:03:20.208 --> 06:03:20.218 align:start position:0%
uh their people are consciously deciding
 
06:03:24.470 --> 06:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
to to topically apply and hopefully
 
06:03:27.110 --> 06:03:27.120 align:start position:0%
carefully because the package says do
 
06:03:28.610 --> 06:03:28.620 align:start position:0%
not swallow
 
06:03:31.070 --> 06:03:31.080 align:start position:0%
if you swallow contact the Poison
 
06:03:33.890 --> 06:03:33.900 align:start position:0%
Control Center
 
06:03:37.070 --> 06:03:37.080 align:start position:0%
um so or if you go to a dentist and have
 
06:03:40.190 --> 06:03:40.200 align:start position:0%
the fluoride topically applied then
 
06:03:42.590 --> 06:03:42.600 align:start position:0%
you're also not going to be ingesting it
 
06:03:45.350 --> 06:03:45.360 align:start position:0%
when you're drinking fluoridated water
 
06:03:48.650 --> 06:03:48.660 align:start position:0%
depending on how much water you drink
 
06:03:50.810 --> 06:03:50.820 align:start position:0%
um and how much you uh cook with with
 
06:03:53.930 --> 06:03:53.940 align:start position:0%
with water and so forth you're going to
 
06:03:57.410 --> 06:03:57.420 align:start position:0%
get way differing rates of exposure to
 
06:04:00.830 --> 06:04:00.840 align:start position:0%
fluoridated water uh but but the the
 
06:04:03.230 --> 06:04:03.240 align:start position:0%
basic answer to your question is let's
 
06:04:04.548 --> 06:04:04.558 align:start position:0%
find out what the latest science
 
06:04:08.270 --> 06:04:08.280 align:start position:0%
suggests the the best current knowledge
 
06:04:11.690 --> 06:04:11.700 align:start position:0%
is and act accordingly
 
06:04:15.350 --> 06:04:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:15.360 --> 06:04:16.270 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:04:16.270 --> 06:04:16.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:04:16.280 --> 06:04:18.170 align:start position:0%
um
so

06:04:18.170 --> 06:04:18.180 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:04:22.430 --> 06:04:22.440 align:start position:0%
I I assume that one eventual result way
 
06:04:25.730 --> 06:04:25.740 align:start position:0%
down the line is that maybe there would
 
06:04:29.750 --> 06:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
be a Prohibition against municipalities
 
06:04:34.670 --> 06:04:34.680 align:start position:0%
um using fluoride in their in their
 
06:04:34.680 --> 06:04:35.750 align:start position:0%
um using fluoride in their in their
um

06:04:35.750 --> 06:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:04:38.390 --> 06:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
public drinking water
 
06:04:41.150 --> 06:04:41.160 align:start position:0%
um so my question really is have you
 
06:04:44.030 --> 06:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
thought about whether this should be
 
06:04:46.490 --> 06:04:46.500 align:start position:0%
addressed on the state level versus the
 
06:04:49.310 --> 06:04:49.320 align:start position:0%
local level for example in Keene
 
06:04:51.650 --> 06:04:51.660 align:start position:0%
um we've made the decision to not have
 
06:04:55.850 --> 06:04:55.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:57.590 --> 06:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm just wondering if you've
 
06:04:59.330 --> 06:04:59.340 align:start position:0%
given consideration to whether this
 
06:05:01.910 --> 06:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
should be a local decision or a
 
06:05:03.708 --> 06:05:03.718 align:start position:0%
Statewide issue
 
06:05:06.230 --> 06:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
I certainly have considered all kinds of
 
06:05:08.628 --> 06:05:08.638 align:start position:0%
things but what I'm suggesting to the
 
06:05:10.850 --> 06:05:10.860 align:start position:0%
this committee into the legislature is
 
06:05:12.590 --> 06:05:12.600 align:start position:0%
that we
 
06:05:15.590 --> 06:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
take a new look at water fluoridation
 
06:05:19.250 --> 06:05:19.260 align:start position:0%
and its impact especially on children
 
06:05:21.230 --> 06:05:21.240 align:start position:0%
either in utero
 
06:05:25.730 --> 06:05:25.740 align:start position:0%
or in uh no that are young toddlers who
 
06:05:29.690 --> 06:05:29.700 align:start position:0%
are being either breastfed or with with
 
06:05:32.750 --> 06:05:32.760 align:start position:0%
formula because I think that is
 
06:05:34.490 --> 06:05:34.500 align:start position:0%
something that it would be very
 
06:05:36.770 --> 06:05:36.780 align:start position:0%
troubling water fluoridation the science
 
06:05:38.868 --> 06:05:38.878 align:start position:0%
of water fluoridation you know is quite
 
06:05:41.150 --> 06:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
old I mean I think it's been around for
 
06:05:44.628 --> 06:05:44.638 align:start position:0%
something like 80 years
 
06:05:46.868 --> 06:05:46.878 align:start position:0%
uh I think some of the original
 
06:05:50.330 --> 06:05:50.340 align:start position:0%
scientific beliefs have been uh have
 
06:05:53.868 --> 06:05:53.878 align:start position:0%
been disproven uh over time and there
 
06:05:56.810 --> 06:05:56.820 align:start position:0%
are these recent studies as I say that
 
06:05:59.628 --> 06:05:59.638 align:start position:0%
that I really think the the state of New
 
06:06:01.730 --> 06:06:01.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has an obligation to look at
 
06:06:04.788 --> 06:06:04.798 align:start position:0%
and then then you in the first instance
 
06:06:08.570 --> 06:06:08.580 align:start position:0%
but the legislator legislature as a
 
06:06:10.910 --> 06:06:10.920 align:start position:0%
whole subsequently should look at these
 
06:06:15.350 --> 06:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
and decide whether science dictates or
 
06:06:17.868 --> 06:06:17.878 align:start position:0%
suggests a different course of action
 
06:06:19.970 --> 06:06:19.980 align:start position:0%
than we currently have in New Hampshire
 
06:06:23.150 --> 06:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
at the moment and based on that either I
 
06:06:26.448 --> 06:06:26.458 align:start position:0%
if I'm still around uh or someone else
 
06:06:28.910 --> 06:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
in the future should draw the
 
06:06:31.190 --> 06:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
consequences and the conclusions that
 
06:06:34.190 --> 06:06:34.200 align:start position:0%
would would arise out of the kind of
 
06:06:38.090 --> 06:06:38.100 align:start position:0%
study that this bill requests
 
06:06:40.730 --> 06:06:40.740 align:start position:0%
yeah representative Leon thank you Mr
 
06:06:42.250 --> 06:06:42.260 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you representative
 
06:06:44.570 --> 06:06:44.580 align:start position:0%
with the number of committees we have
 
06:06:46.368 --> 06:06:46.378 align:start position:0%
and the people on this one would you be
 
06:06:48.110 --> 06:06:48.120 align:start position:0%
willing to serve on this if we were to
 
06:06:50.390 --> 06:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
move forward and help find others I'm
 
06:06:53.448 --> 06:06:53.458 align:start position:0%
still around I I would love to to have
 
06:06:57.590 --> 06:06:57.600 align:start position:0%
the opportunity well I'm almost 85. uh I
 
06:07:00.890 --> 06:07:00.900 align:start position:0%
I'll be 87 at the end of this term
 
06:07:03.288 --> 06:07:03.298 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I want to do this for two
 
06:07:05.448 --> 06:07:05.458 align:start position:0%
more years after that oh that's all
 
06:07:07.250 --> 06:07:07.260 align:start position:0%
right the report's due by November 1st
 
06:07:08.270 --> 06:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
of this year
 
06:07:10.368 --> 06:07:10.378 align:start position:0%
okay so I hope you're around much longer
 
06:07:11.510 --> 06:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
than that
 
06:07:14.330 --> 06:07:14.340 align:start position:0%
other questions not doing bad for 85 but
 
06:07:16.150 --> 06:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
uh but the the
 
06:07:19.310 --> 06:07:19.320 align:start position:0%
degenerative process accelerates in some
 
06:07:22.368 --> 06:07:22.378 align:start position:0%
cases I'm saying no other questions
 
06:07:25.368 --> 06:07:25.378 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative thank you
 
06:07:30.170 --> 06:07:30.180 align:start position:0%

for the record I am Brenda berkal I am
 
06:07:50.208 --> 06:07:50.218 align:start position:0%
president of the New Hampshire Dental
 
06:07:50.218 --> 06:07:52.070 align:start position:0%
president of the New Hampshire Dental
Society

06:07:52.070 --> 06:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
Society
 
06:07:54.890 --> 06:07:54.900 align:start position:0%
we represent dentists Dental team
 
06:07:56.990 --> 06:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
members and our patients
 
06:07:59.510 --> 06:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
it's on behalf of the latter group our
 
06:08:02.810 --> 06:08:02.820 align:start position:0%
patients which hopefully includes all of
 
06:08:02.820 --> 06:08:03.770 align:start position:0%
patients which hopefully includes all of
you

06:08:03.770 --> 06:08:03.780 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:08:06.170 --> 06:08:06.180 align:start position:0%
um that I appear before you today in
 
06:08:10.070 --> 06:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
opposition to hb217 as most of you know
 
06:08:11.570 --> 06:08:11.580 align:start position:0%
last year
 
06:08:16.070 --> 06:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
after Decades of intensive bipartisan
 
06:08:16.080 --> 06:08:17.090 align:start position:0%
after Decades of intensive bipartisan
work

06:08:17.090 --> 06:08:17.100 align:start position:0%
work
 
06:08:19.368 --> 06:08:19.378 align:start position:0%
the general court passed and the
 
06:08:23.570 --> 06:08:23.580 align:start position:0%
governor signed a Medicaid bill for
 
06:08:25.310 --> 06:08:25.320 align:start position:0%
adult benefits
 
06:08:27.530 --> 06:08:27.540 align:start position:0%
like the children's benefit
 
06:08:29.510 --> 06:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
that's currently in place the new law
 
06:08:31.610 --> 06:08:31.620 align:start position:0%
will help thousands of New Hampshire
 
06:08:33.770 --> 06:08:33.780 align:start position:0%
residents who otherwise haven't been
 
06:08:36.770 --> 06:08:36.780 align:start position:0%
able to access Dental Care
 
06:08:36.780 --> 06:08:39.708 align:start position:0%
able to access Dental Care
um

06:08:39.708 --> 06:08:39.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:43.070 --> 06:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
and that affects their overall health
 
06:08:45.470 --> 06:08:45.480 align:start position:0%
uh that age thing
 
06:08:47.868 --> 06:08:47.878 align:start position:0%
um many of those at this very table
 
06:08:51.230 --> 06:08:51.240 align:start position:0%
helped Champion that very important work
 
06:08:53.750 --> 06:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
using reliable economic and scientific
 
06:08:56.990 --> 06:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
studies as the basis for your work our
 
06:08:58.490 --> 06:08:58.500 align:start position:0%
residents will thank you for that
 
06:09:01.030 --> 06:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
approach as do I
 
06:09:04.128 --> 06:09:04.138 align:start position:0%
unfortunately this bill is
 
06:09:06.350 --> 06:09:06.360 align:start position:0%
representative of a desire to move away
 
06:09:09.170 --> 06:09:09.180 align:start position:0%
from a scientifically proven benefit for
 
06:09:10.868 --> 06:09:10.878 align:start position:0%
the public oral health
 
06:09:14.330 --> 06:09:14.340 align:start position:0%
hb217 would give air to those who would
 
06:09:16.970 --> 06:09:16.980 align:start position:0%
use faulty and unfounded studies to
 
06:09:18.288 --> 06:09:18.298 align:start position:0%
bring an end to community water
 
06:09:18.298 --> 06:09:20.150 align:start position:0%
bring an end to community water
fluoridation

06:09:20.150 --> 06:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
fluoridation
 
06:09:22.610 --> 06:09:22.620 align:start position:0%
that safely and equitably protect the
 
06:09:24.170 --> 06:09:24.180 align:start position:0%
health of all of New Hampshire's
 
06:09:26.330 --> 06:09:26.340 align:start position:0%
children including those within the
 
06:09:28.548 --> 06:09:28.558 align:start position:0%
Medicaid population
 
06:09:30.830 --> 06:09:30.840 align:start position:0%
young children who don't know how to
 
06:09:33.650 --> 06:09:33.660 align:start position:0%
spit out yet cannot use fluoride
 
06:09:33.660 --> 06:09:35.150 align:start position:0%
spit out yet cannot use fluoride
toothpaste

06:09:35.150 --> 06:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
toothpaste
 
06:09:38.150 --> 06:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
so um they need to ingest the fluoride
 
06:09:40.548 --> 06:09:40.558 align:start position:0%
to help their teeth develop
 
06:09:42.470 --> 06:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
I have a patient
 
06:09:44.270 --> 06:09:44.280 align:start position:0%
he's been with me for about a dozen
 
06:09:46.910 --> 06:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
years he's in his mid 70s
 
06:09:50.390 --> 06:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
for all the time I had known him
 
06:09:52.368 --> 06:09:52.378 align:start position:0%
he might have had a filling wear out but
 
06:09:54.948 --> 06:09:54.958 align:start position:0%
he never had cavities about a month ago
 
06:09:57.650 --> 06:09:57.660 align:start position:0%
he came into my practice with half a
 
06:09:59.750 --> 06:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
dozen brand new cavities on the roots of
 
06:10:02.150 --> 06:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
his teeth which is a really bad spot to
 
06:10:04.610 --> 06:10:04.620 align:start position:0%
get a cavity and we were talking to try
 
06:10:07.070 --> 06:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
and figure out what had happened and his
 
06:10:09.048 --> 06:10:09.058 align:start position:0%
wife had decided that they should start
 
06:10:10.910 --> 06:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
using a toothpaste with no fluoride
 
06:10:13.368 --> 06:10:13.378 align:start position:0%
within the last year and it had a major
 
06:10:16.670 --> 06:10:16.680 align:start position:0%
drastic effect on his oral health
 
06:10:18.590 --> 06:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
as a dentist and health care
 
06:10:21.410 --> 06:10:21.420 align:start position:0%
practitioner I constantly examine the
 
06:10:22.970 --> 06:10:22.980 align:start position:0%
latest data that comes from
 
06:10:25.548 --> 06:10:25.558 align:start position:0%
evidence-based studies on the best way
 
06:10:28.970 --> 06:10:28.980 align:start position:0%
to protect oral and overall health
 
06:10:31.368 --> 06:10:31.378 align:start position:0%
I like my dentist colleagues am
 
06:10:34.250 --> 06:10:34.260 align:start position:0%
committed to a strict code of ethics and
 
06:10:35.930 --> 06:10:35.940 align:start position:0%
professional conduct
 
06:10:38.628 --> 06:10:38.638 align:start position:0%
as well as the Hippocratic Oath both of
 
06:10:40.310 --> 06:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
which demand that we dedicate our
 
06:10:42.470 --> 06:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
professional lives to safeguarding the
 
06:10:44.510 --> 06:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
health of our patients and do them no
 
06:10:44.520 --> 06:10:45.610 align:start position:0%
health of our patients and do them no
harm

06:10:45.610 --> 06:10:45.620 align:start position:0%
harm
 
06:10:48.890 --> 06:10:48.900 align:start position:0%
hb217 however encourages the Embrace of
 
06:10:51.590 --> 06:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
misinformation in an effort to violate
 
06:10:53.390 --> 06:10:53.400 align:start position:0%
my ethical codes
 
06:10:56.930 --> 06:10:56.940 align:start position:0%
so it is for these reasons that I
 
06:10:59.208 --> 06:10:59.218 align:start position:0%
um hope that you will vote 217 in
 
06:11:01.070 --> 06:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate
 
06:11:04.190 --> 06:11:04.200 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative King
 
06:11:06.230 --> 06:11:06.240 align:start position:0%
are you taking questions ma'am or yes
 
06:11:07.670 --> 06:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman McDonald thank you
 
06:11:10.070 --> 06:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
for taking questions
 
06:11:13.788 --> 06:11:13.798 align:start position:0%
um I take it you've read this bill and
 
06:11:15.530 --> 06:11:15.540 align:start position:0%
the way I see it that there's going to
 
06:11:16.788 --> 06:11:16.798 align:start position:0%
be four members of the House of
 
06:11:18.230 --> 06:11:18.240 align:start position:0%
Representatives and one member of the
 
06:11:21.350 --> 06:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
Senate it doesn't say in this bill that
 
06:11:24.048 --> 06:11:24.058 align:start position:0%
these five members are going to be of
 
06:11:28.250 --> 06:11:28.260 align:start position:0%
the crackpot wing of you know of the
 
06:11:30.288 --> 06:11:30.298 align:start position:0%
anti-science Brigade
 
06:11:33.470 --> 06:11:33.480 align:start position:0%
um it could very well end up being that
 
06:11:36.708 --> 06:11:36.718 align:start position:0%
uh they find out that fluoride is like
 
06:11:38.390 --> 06:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
the best thing ever and then you get
 
06:11:42.410 --> 06:11:42.420 align:start position:0%
cities like Keene that Implement uh you
 
06:11:44.628 --> 06:11:44.638 align:start position:0%
know fluoride in their drinking water
 
06:11:47.390 --> 06:11:47.400 align:start position:0%
um why is it that you're afraid that
 
06:11:49.610 --> 06:11:49.620 align:start position:0%
it's why are you so convinced that it's
 
06:11:51.470 --> 06:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
going to come out negative
 
06:11:55.788 --> 06:11:55.798 align:start position:0%
um yeah there has been massive
 
06:12:00.410 --> 06:12:00.420 align:start position:0%
public study of fluoride over the last
 
06:12:02.690 --> 06:12:02.700 align:start position:0%
80 years basically
 
06:12:04.970 --> 06:12:04.980 align:start position:0%
when fluoridation was first started
 
06:12:07.670 --> 06:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
there were towns that had it next to
 
06:12:10.190 --> 06:12:10.200 align:start position:0%
towns that didn't have it and they
 
06:12:12.470 --> 06:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
compared the demographics
 
06:12:14.690 --> 06:12:14.700 align:start position:0%
and they studied the populations of both
 
06:12:17.930 --> 06:12:17.940 align:start position:0%
towns and there were no ill effects in
 
06:12:20.750 --> 06:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
the fluoridated towns so I do not think
 
06:12:24.530 --> 06:12:24.540 align:start position:0%
that any bad effects would be found the
 
06:12:26.628 --> 06:12:26.638 align:start position:0%
World Health Organization has declared
 
06:12:29.810 --> 06:12:29.820 align:start position:0%
that public water fluoridation is the
 
06:12:31.610 --> 06:12:31.620 align:start position:0%
most cost effective Public Health
 
06:12:33.530 --> 06:12:33.540 align:start position:0%
measure ever
 
06:12:37.368 --> 06:12:37.378 align:start position:0%
um so I'm just hoping that the house
 
06:12:40.970 --> 06:12:40.980 align:start position:0%
doesn't waste time follow up follow up
 
06:12:43.190 --> 06:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
so yes I understand what your position
 
06:12:46.010 --> 06:12:46.020 align:start position:0%
is but it could very well be that the
 
06:12:48.110 --> 06:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
committee comes to your conclusion and
 
06:12:49.850 --> 06:12:49.860 align:start position:0%
and I it just seems to me like you've
 
06:12:52.430 --> 06:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
already got this uh preconceived notion
 
06:12:53.448 --> 06:12:53.458 align:start position:0%
that they're going to come to the
 
06:12:55.310 --> 06:12:55.320 align:start position:0%
opposite conclusion and if they were to
 
06:12:57.530 --> 06:12:57.540 align:start position:0%
come to your conclusion it could result
 
06:13:00.170 --> 06:13:00.180 align:start position:0%
in more cities Florida in their water so
 
06:13:01.670 --> 06:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
I just again I don't understand why
 
06:13:03.410 --> 06:13:03.420 align:start position:0%
you're automatically thinking that this
 
06:13:04.970 --> 06:13:04.980 align:start position:0%
committee is going to come to the
 
06:13:06.590 --> 06:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
conclusion that's opposite of you thank
 
06:13:09.948 --> 06:13:09.958 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman could I remind all of us
 
06:13:12.770 --> 06:13:12.780 align:start position:0%
that we don't question what's in other
 
06:13:15.650 --> 06:13:15.660 align:start position:0%
people's minds or or inquiring to them
 
06:13:17.628 --> 06:13:17.638 align:start position:0%
they're they're allowed to give their
 
06:13:19.970 --> 06:13:19.980 align:start position:0%
testimony without being examined or
 
06:13:22.610 --> 06:13:22.620 align:start position:0%
having motives or thoughts attributed to
 
06:13:22.620 --> 06:13:23.330 align:start position:0%
having motives or thoughts attributed to
them

06:13:23.330 --> 06:13:23.340 align:start position:0%
them
 
06:13:27.650 --> 06:13:27.660 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you any other questions
 
06:13:31.010 --> 06:13:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:33.590 --> 06:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
I definitely need a longer hand thank
 
06:13:34.730 --> 06:13:34.740 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for my
 
06:13:34.740 --> 06:13:35.990 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for my
question

06:13:35.990 --> 06:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:13:38.810 --> 06:13:38.820 align:start position:0%
I I do support the committee in partner
 
06:13:40.788 --> 06:13:40.798 align:start position:0%
with rationale to doing that when I
 
06:13:42.410 --> 06:13:42.420 align:start position:0%
looked at a study that came out of
 
06:13:44.810 --> 06:13:44.820 align:start position:0%
Canada in 2019
 
06:13:47.628 --> 06:13:47.638 align:start position:0%
what it references in the US we have 66
 
06:13:49.010 --> 06:13:49.020 align:start position:0%
percent of residents covered with
 
06:13:50.390 --> 06:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
fluorinated water
 
06:13:53.208 --> 06:13:53.218 align:start position:0%
in Canada it's only 38 in Europe is
 
06:13:55.010 --> 06:13:55.020 align:start position:0%
three percent and I'd like to understand
 
06:13:56.570 --> 06:13:56.580 align:start position:0%
why there's such variance between
 
06:13:58.070 --> 06:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
countries and I think this would be a
 
06:13:59.510 --> 06:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
way for the committee to begin to
 
06:14:01.250 --> 06:14:01.260 align:start position:0%
understand why we have such a variance
 
06:14:03.048 --> 06:14:03.058 align:start position:0%
throughout the world given what you
 
06:14:05.090 --> 06:14:05.100 align:start position:0%
talked about again with who so therefore
 
06:14:06.650 --> 06:14:06.660 align:start position:0%
would you be in support of this because
 
06:14:09.708 --> 06:14:09.718 align:start position:0%
there is tremendous variance in how
 
06:14:13.128 --> 06:14:13.138 align:start position:0%
countries utilize foreign Nation
 
06:14:16.310 --> 06:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
I am not very well informed about why
 
06:14:18.830 --> 06:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
various locations have or don't have
 
06:14:18.840 --> 06:14:20.570 align:start position:0%
various locations have or don't have
fluoridation

06:14:20.570 --> 06:14:20.580 align:start position:0%
fluoridation
 
06:14:22.610 --> 06:14:22.620 align:start position:0%
some of it may be
 
06:14:25.250 --> 06:14:25.260 align:start position:0%
like areas with Wells but I don't really
 
06:14:28.128 --> 06:14:28.138 align:start position:0%
feel that I can speak
 
06:14:32.448 --> 06:14:32.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:38.628 --> 06:14:38.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:41.030 --> 06:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Katie lajoy
 
06:14:47.090 --> 06:14:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:47.100 --> 06:14:52.548 align:start position:0%

06:14:52.548 --> 06:14:52.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:56.150 --> 06:14:56.160 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Katie lajoy
 
06:14:58.490 --> 06:14:58.500 align:start position:0%
I'm a nurse I live in Charlestown I'm
 
06:15:00.590 --> 06:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
here just today to support house bill
 
06:15:00.600 --> 06:15:02.150 align:start position:0%
here just today to support house bill
217.

06:15:02.150 --> 06:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
217.
 
06:15:04.548 --> 06:15:04.558 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire law currently allows
 
06:15:06.110 --> 06:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
for the addition of fluoridation
 
06:15:09.110 --> 06:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
chemicals to the public water supplies
 
06:15:11.510 --> 06:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
of about a dozen communities in the
 
06:15:14.150 --> 06:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
state the legislature however has not
 
06:15:16.190 --> 06:15:16.200 align:start position:0%
independently looked at the latest
 
06:15:18.708 --> 06:15:18.718 align:start position:0%
science on how the practice can impact
 
06:15:18.718 --> 06:15:20.030 align:start position:0%
science on how the practice can impact
citizens

06:15:20.030 --> 06:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
06:15:22.310 --> 06:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
I support such a fact-finding mission
 
06:15:24.708 --> 06:15:24.718 align:start position:0%
because according to lamphere at Al in
 
06:15:27.470 --> 06:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
2020 the debate on the fluoridation of
 
06:15:30.350 --> 06:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
drinking water has been reignited as new
 
06:15:33.048 --> 06:15:33.058 align:start position:0%
studies find that fluoride is toxic to
 
06:15:35.750 --> 06:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
the developing brain and this occurs at
 
06:15:37.490 --> 06:15:37.500 align:start position:0%
levels routinely found in the general
 
06:15:37.500 --> 06:15:39.048 align:start position:0%
levels routinely found in the general
population

06:15:39.048 --> 06:15:39.058 align:start position:0%
population
 
06:15:41.448 --> 06:15:41.458 align:start position:0%
I'm here today as a private citizen but
 
06:15:43.070 --> 06:15:43.080 align:start position:0%
for many years I worked as a public
 
06:15:45.230 --> 06:15:45.240 align:start position:0%
health nurse with a childhood lead
 
06:15:47.810 --> 06:15:47.820 align:start position:0%
poisoning prevention program and I
 
06:15:50.030 --> 06:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
understand about lead being neurotoxic
 
06:15:51.770 --> 06:15:51.780 align:start position:0%
and affecting children's growth and
 
06:15:51.780 --> 06:15:52.730 align:start position:0%
and affecting children's growth and
development

06:15:52.730 --> 06:15:52.740 align:start position:0%
development
 
06:15:54.708 --> 06:15:54.718 align:start position:0%
I also understand that in the United
 
06:15:56.628 --> 06:15:56.638 align:start position:0%
States there was pushback from the lead
 
06:15:59.750 --> 06:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
industry with regard to regulations and
 
06:16:02.448 --> 06:16:02.458 align:start position:0%
bans on lead-based paint according to
 
06:16:05.390 --> 06:16:05.400 align:start position:0%
Rosner and Markowitz since the 1920s the
 
06:16:07.368 --> 06:16:07.378 align:start position:0%
lead industry had organized to fight
 
06:16:09.770 --> 06:16:09.780 align:start position:0%
bans restrictions even warnings on paint
 
06:16:12.530 --> 06:16:12.540 align:start position:0%
can labels it had marketed the deadly
 
06:16:14.150 --> 06:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
product to children and parents
 
06:16:16.548 --> 06:16:16.558 align:start position:0%
spreading the lie that lead paint is
 
06:16:19.010 --> 06:16:19.020 align:start position:0%
safe it was safe we want to write Bill
 
06:16:21.890 --> 06:16:21.900 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman yeah but again it's about
 
06:16:24.048 --> 06:16:24.058 align:start position:0%
fluoride not about lead paint man I'm
 
06:16:26.330 --> 06:16:26.340 align:start position:0%
making the connection oh honestly I beg
 
06:16:29.090 --> 06:16:29.100 align:start position:0%
your pardon it's okay with regard to
 
06:16:31.490 --> 06:16:31.500 align:start position:0%
water flow Edition we must avoid the
 
06:16:34.190 --> 06:16:34.200 align:start position:0%
nature and extent of the denial seen in
 
06:16:36.230 --> 06:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
the past with childhood lead poisoning
 
06:16:40.190 --> 06:16:40.200 align:start position:0%
and I see a really big similarity in the
 
06:16:41.570 --> 06:16:41.580 align:start position:0%
history of fluoride in the history of
 
06:16:43.868 --> 06:16:43.878 align:start position:0%
lead in terms of the denial
 
06:16:46.610 --> 06:16:46.620 align:start position:0%
according to lamphereadau mounting
 
06:16:48.948 --> 06:16:48.958 align:start position:0%
evidence suggests fluoride may be hand
 
06:16:51.530 --> 06:16:51.540 align:start position:0%
um hampering brain development and
 
06:16:54.170 --> 06:16:54.180 align:start position:0%
reducing kids IQ the U.S needs to
 
06:16:56.690 --> 06:16:56.700 align:start position:0%
rethink this exposure for pregnant women
 
06:16:58.150 --> 06:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
and children
 
06:17:00.708 --> 06:17:00.718 align:start position:0%
consider the following an important
 
06:17:02.690 --> 06:17:02.700 align:start position:0%
research study concerning the
 
06:17:04.490 --> 06:17:04.500 align:start position:0%

06:17:16.610 --> 06:17:16.620 align:start position:0%
Jama this is a very prestigious journal
 
06:17:18.708 --> 06:17:18.718 align:start position:0%
the study States fluoride exposure
 
06:17:20.930 --> 06:17:20.940 align:start position:0%

three of the authors said our studies is
 
06:17:34.368 --> 06:17:34.378 align:start position:0%
consistent with other high quality
 
06:17:36.948 --> 06:17:36.958 align:start position:0%
research it's not a standalone study
 
06:17:39.830 --> 06:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
more than 50 Studies have shown an
 
06:17:42.590 --> 06:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
association between high or fluoride
 
06:17:46.610 --> 06:17:46.620 align:start position:0%
exposure and IQ lower IQ Basha Shadel
 
06:17:49.128 --> 06:17:49.138 align:start position:0%
also found IQ decrements in children
 
06:17:51.708 --> 06:17:51.718 align:start position:0%
exposed to fluoride and utero they
 
06:17:53.628 --> 06:17:53.638 align:start position:0%
report in this study higher prenatal
 
06:17:55.430 --> 06:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
fluoride exposure in the general range
 
06:17:57.708 --> 06:17:57.718 align:start position:0%
of exposures reported for other general
 
06:18:00.048 --> 06:18:00.058 align:start position:0%
population samples of pregnant women and
 
06:18:02.510 --> 06:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
non-pregnant adults was associated with
 
06:18:04.310 --> 06:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
lower scores on tests of cognitive
 
06:18:06.770 --> 06:18:06.780 align:start position:0%
function in The Offspring at age four
 
06:18:09.650 --> 06:18:09.660 align:start position:0%
and age 6 to 12 years
 
06:18:12.350 --> 06:18:12.360 align:start position:0%
riddle it all found that higher tap
 
06:18:14.510 --> 06:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
water fluoride levels and fluoridation
 
06:18:16.548 --> 06:18:16.558 align:start position:0%
of Municipal Water Supplies were
 
06:18:19.010 --> 06:18:19.020 align:start position:0%
associated with a higher risk of an ADHD

diagnosis as well as increased symptoms
 
06:18:23.270 --> 06:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
of hyperactivity and inattention
 
06:18:26.448 --> 06:18:26.458 align:start position:0%
especially among adolescents this points
 
06:18:28.430 --> 06:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
to a potential cumulative effect of
 
06:18:30.410 --> 06:18:30.420 align:start position:0%
fluoride exposure and highlights the
 
06:18:32.750 --> 06:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
need for further investigation of the
 
06:18:34.670 --> 06:18:34.680 align:start position:0%

06:18:45.048 --> 06:18:45.058 align:start position:0%
wrapping up please pardon me please stop
 
06:18:47.208 --> 06:18:47.218 align:start position:0%
wrapping up your testimony I'm just well
 
06:18:50.750 --> 06:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
could you start concluding you had three
 
06:18:52.490 --> 06:18:52.500 align:start position:0%
minutes ma'am okay
 
06:18:55.430 --> 06:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
um I I will send you this by uh email
 
06:18:57.350 --> 06:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
and there's a couple other studies
 
06:18:59.208 --> 06:18:59.218 align:start position:0%
showing the direct link between
 
06:19:02.030 --> 06:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
fluoridation and um
 
06:19:04.548 --> 06:19:04.558 align:start position:0%
uh lower IQs
 
06:19:08.208 --> 06:19:08.218 align:start position:0%
um according to till at L uh mounting
 
06:19:10.310 --> 06:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
scientific evidence showing a consistent
 
06:19:12.650 --> 06:19:12.660 align:start position:0%
pattern of lower IQ associated with
 
06:19:15.590 --> 06:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
early if exposure to fluoride she asked
 
06:19:17.090 --> 06:19:17.100 align:start position:0%
how much more information is needed
 
06:19:19.490 --> 06:19:19.500 align:start position:0%
before we raise concern at least for a
 
06:19:22.310 --> 06:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
particular subset of the population she
 
06:19:24.110 --> 06:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
cautions that failure to act could
 
06:19:26.208 --> 06:19:26.218 align:start position:0%
amount to enormous costs at the
 
06:19:28.670 --> 06:19:28.680 align:start position:0%
population level
 
06:19:28.680 --> 06:19:29.208 align:start position:0%
population level
um

06:19:29.208 --> 06:19:29.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:19:31.788 --> 06:19:31.798 align:start position:0%
okay thank you ma'am and um your support
 
06:19:33.770 --> 06:19:33.780 align:start position:0%
will help for this bill will help
 
06:19:35.628 --> 06:19:35.638 align:start position:0%
increase our understanding of fluoride's
 
06:19:37.670 --> 06:19:37.680 align:start position:0%
risk to the developing brain and will
 
06:19:39.708 --> 06:19:39.718 align:start position:0%
inform policies going forward regarding
 
06:19:41.810 --> 06:19:41.820 align:start position:0%
dental care for our children thank you
 
06:19:44.628 --> 06:19:44.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:46.670 --> 06:19:46.680 align:start position:0%
saying no questions thank you I'll get
 
06:19:49.368 --> 06:19:49.378 align:start position:0%
this to you by uh electronically
 
06:19:51.948 --> 06:19:51.958 align:start position:0%
yeah okay thank you
 
06:19:54.890 --> 06:19:54.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:56.570 --> 06:19:56.580 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is
 
06:20:09.048 --> 06:20:09.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:11.090 --> 06:20:11.100 align:start position:0%
hello Emily Phillips Rockingham 7
 
06:20:12.770 --> 06:20:12.780 align:start position:0%
Fremont New Hampshire I want to thank
 
06:20:14.628 --> 06:20:14.638 align:start position:0%
the sponsor for bringing this bill
 
06:20:17.690 --> 06:20:17.700 align:start position:0%
forward uh as it suggests in the
 
06:20:20.810 --> 06:20:20.820 align:start position:0%
language fluoride is a neurotoxin
 
06:20:23.270 --> 06:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
um there's nothing in the the bill the
 
06:20:24.948 --> 06:20:24.958 align:start position:0%
legislation to say anything against
 
06:20:26.930 --> 06:20:26.940 align:start position:0%
Dental practices I don't see that as a
 
06:20:28.910 --> 06:20:28.920 align:start position:0%
threat right now there are many sources
 
06:20:30.948 --> 06:20:30.958 align:start position:0%
of fluoride drinking water toothpaste
 
06:20:32.690 --> 06:20:32.700 align:start position:0%
topical varnishes I think we're talking
 
06:20:34.788 --> 06:20:34.798 align:start position:0%
about cumulative exposure being the
 
06:20:37.730 --> 06:20:37.740 align:start position:0%
concern and something worth studying my
 
06:20:40.610 --> 06:20:40.620 align:start position:0%
parental motto is To Know Better do
 
06:20:43.490 --> 06:20:43.500 align:start position:0%
better so let's find out
 
06:20:45.350 --> 06:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
um I don't believe I want to thank rep
 
06:20:47.090 --> 06:20:47.100 align:start position:0%
King for his question we are not wasting
 
06:20:49.670 --> 06:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
time by forming this committee what are
 
06:20:52.610 --> 06:20:52.620 align:start position:0%
we so afraid of is it the truth
 
06:20:54.590 --> 06:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
06:20:57.948 --> 06:20:57.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:02.868 --> 06:21:02.878 align:start position:0%

division of Public Health Services as I
 
06:21:40.368 --> 06:21:40.378 align:start position:0%
said no position on the bill but we
 
06:21:42.590 --> 06:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
would be happy to be at the study
 
06:21:44.330 --> 06:21:44.340 align:start position:0%
committee if the bill was enacted to
 
06:21:46.670 --> 06:21:46.680 align:start position:0%
discuss the benefits of fluoride in
 
06:21:49.548 --> 06:21:49.558 align:start position:0%
regards to oral health thank you
 
06:21:52.250 --> 06:21:52.260 align:start position:0%
thank you questions

06:22:19.128 --> 06:22:19.138 align:start position:0%
well we don't know if it's pretty good
 
06:22:21.110 --> 06:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
yet I want to hear
 
06:22:27.590 --> 06:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:29.990 --> 06:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
it's all right but it's erante actually
 
06:22:32.270 --> 06:22:32.280 align:start position:0%
okay I'm sorry that's all right uh don't
 
06:22:33.830 --> 06:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
worry about it it's not the first time
 
06:22:36.650 --> 06:22:36.660 align:start position:0%
it's been mispronounced that's for sure
 
06:22:39.048 --> 06:22:39.058 align:start position:0%
um I'm here representing Northeast Delta
 
06:22:40.788 --> 06:22:40.798 align:start position:0%
Dental I am a dentist Mickey speaking to
 
06:22:44.570 --> 06:22:44.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:46.430 --> 06:22:46.440 align:start position:0%
is that better
 
06:22:50.628 --> 06:22:50.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:53.930 --> 06:22:53.940 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you
 
06:22:56.810 --> 06:22:56.820 align:start position:0%
um so I'm Joseph orante and I work for
 
06:22:59.628 --> 06:22:59.638 align:start position:0%
Northeast Delta Dental I'm a dentist as
 
06:23:03.048 --> 06:23:03.058 align:start position:0%
well uh practice for about 20 years in
 
06:23:06.650 --> 06:23:06.660 align:start position:0%
uh in Tucson Arizona which is the
 
06:23:09.230 --> 06:23:09.240 align:start position:0%
largest metropolitan area in the country
 
06:23:11.990 --> 06:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
in the world actually that's totally on
 
06:23:14.930 --> 06:23:14.940 align:start position:0%
Subterranean water or it used to be it's
 
06:23:17.930 --> 06:23:17.940 align:start position:0%
now got uh
 
06:23:22.128 --> 06:23:22.138 align:start position:0%
above ground water as well but and we
 
06:23:24.110 --> 06:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
did have some communities on the edges
 
06:23:26.930 --> 06:23:26.940 align:start position:0%
of Tucson metropolitan area that had
 
06:23:29.448 --> 06:23:29.458 align:start position:0%
very high concentrations of fluoride in
 
06:23:32.810 --> 06:23:32.820 align:start position:0%
the water and the floridosis the
 
06:23:36.890 --> 06:23:36.900 align:start position:0%
fluorosis that I found was uh minimal
 
06:23:39.530 --> 06:23:39.540 align:start position:0%
and it was really you could only see it
 
06:23:43.250 --> 06:23:43.260 align:start position:0%
with uh with the dental light and dry
 
06:23:46.090 --> 06:23:46.100 align:start position:0%
tooth and so it was a pretty nominal
 
06:23:50.750 --> 06:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
issue and I guess my concern in my read
 
06:23:53.390 --> 06:23:53.400 align:start position:0%
of the bill is not so much worried about
 
06:23:57.410 --> 06:23:57.420 align:start position:0%
what new science is out there but it's
 
06:23:59.930 --> 06:23:59.940 align:start position:0%
more about it seemed like my read of the
 
06:23:59.940 --> 06:24:00.650 align:start position:0%
more about it seemed like my read of the
bill

06:24:00.650 --> 06:24:00.660 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:24:03.770 --> 06:24:03.780 align:start position:0%
indicates that it's going to be focused
 
06:24:06.530 --> 06:24:06.540 align:start position:0%
on the ill effects and not so much on
 
06:24:08.628 --> 06:24:08.638 align:start position:0%
all of the effects and I think that
 
06:24:12.170 --> 06:24:12.180 align:start position:0%
there's been uh many years at least 50
 
06:24:15.350 --> 06:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
years of my time in since in dentistry
 
06:24:18.830 --> 06:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
where it's been demonstrated to be uh at
 
06:24:21.470 --> 06:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
least beneficial when it comes to
 
06:24:24.708 --> 06:24:24.718 align:start position:0%
carries or tooth decay and prevention
 
06:24:29.448 --> 06:24:29.458 align:start position:0%
and so I just want to make sure that if
 
06:24:32.390 --> 06:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
it goes forward that there's that we're
 
06:24:34.368 --> 06:24:34.378 align:start position:0%
not just considering the ill effects
 
06:24:36.708 --> 06:24:36.718 align:start position:0%
we're considering all of the effects and
 
06:24:40.070 --> 06:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
making a balanced decision about that
 
06:24:42.230 --> 06:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
uh that the science is pretty much
 
06:24:46.548 --> 06:24:46.558 align:start position:0%
settled in my view at least and uh and
 
06:24:48.948 --> 06:24:48.958 align:start position:0%
so I I just kind of was
 
06:24:51.890 --> 06:24:51.900 align:start position:0%
responding to the representative King's
 
06:24:53.990 --> 06:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh question about
 
06:24:56.270 --> 06:24:56.280 align:start position:0%
um about what are we afraid of we're not
 
06:24:58.670 --> 06:24:58.680 align:start position:0%
really afraid of anything if there's new
 
06:25:01.510 --> 06:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
science out there and there's new uh
 
06:25:04.850 --> 06:25:04.860 align:start position:0%
demonstrations of uh ill effects that's
 
06:25:06.590 --> 06:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
great but we just want to make sure that
 
06:25:10.910 --> 06:25:10.920 align:start position:0%
we understand all the effects of it
 
06:25:13.970 --> 06:25:13.980 align:start position:0%
and we're supporting we're not
 
06:25:16.788 --> 06:25:16.798 align:start position:0%
supporting the bill as written and that
 
06:25:20.090 --> 06:25:20.100 align:start position:0%
we don't really see why we're going
 
06:25:22.610 --> 06:25:22.620 align:start position:0%
through this process again it seems like
 
06:25:24.890 --> 06:25:24.900 align:start position:0%
every other year or so we go through
 
06:25:27.230 --> 06:25:27.240 align:start position:0%
this process with a anti-water
 
06:25:30.170 --> 06:25:30.180 align:start position:0%
fluoridation process
 
06:25:32.208 --> 06:25:32.218 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you questions
 
06:25:34.190 --> 06:25:34.200 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman
 
06:25:36.110 --> 06:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
06:25:38.930 --> 06:25:38.940 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned water fluoridation I I
 
06:25:41.570 --> 06:25:41.580 align:start position:0%
didn't I don't know that I saw anything
 
06:25:44.030 --> 06:25:44.040 align:start position:0%
about water fluoridation and if whether
 
06:25:45.948 --> 06:25:45.958 align:start position:0%
the committee should
 
06:25:48.830 --> 06:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
look at that it doesn't that seems like
 
06:25:50.750 --> 06:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
it may be outside the scope of this it
 
06:25:52.510 --> 06:25:52.520 align:start position:0%
looks like it's just talking about
 
06:25:54.650 --> 06:25:54.660 align:start position:0%
fluoride in general and its health
 
06:25:57.590 --> 06:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
effects can you clarify
 
06:26:00.708 --> 06:26:00.718 align:start position:0%
well I think as we heard earlier the it
 
06:26:04.430 --> 06:26:04.440 align:start position:0%
seems like the the uh the bill the
 
06:26:06.110 --> 06:26:06.120 align:start position:0%
legislation that might come out of a
 
06:26:08.448 --> 06:26:08.458 align:start position:0%
committee a recommendation for
 
06:26:09.948 --> 06:26:09.958 align:start position:0%
legislation that might come out of a
 
06:26:11.930 --> 06:26:11.940 align:start position:0%
committee might be
 
06:26:15.048 --> 06:26:15.058 align:start position:0%
leveled at water fluoridation and that's
 
06:26:17.990 --> 06:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
why I connected the two
 
06:26:24.350 --> 06:26:24.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:34.128 --> 06:26:34.138 align:start position:0%

asking everybody to stay at three or you
 
06:26:55.548 --> 06:26:55.558 align:start position:0%
know start wrapping up at least at three
 
06:26:57.048 --> 06:26:57.058 align:start position:0%
I'll keep it as brief as possible my

fluoride our organization supports this
 
06:27:15.708 --> 06:27:15.718 align:start position:0%
legislation which has bipartisan
 
06:27:18.110 --> 06:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
sponsorship and support and the last
 
06:27:19.368 --> 06:27:19.378 align:start position:0%
time was before this committee was in
 
06:27:22.368 --> 06:27:22.378 align:start position:0%
2012 when I came here to urge you to
 
06:27:25.010 --> 06:27:25.020 align:start position:0%
look at the dental fluorosis rates and
 
06:27:27.650 --> 06:27:27.660 align:start position:0%
the cdc's own data on it and at the time
 
06:27:29.930 --> 06:27:29.940 align:start position:0%
the dental fluorosis rates were at 41
 
06:27:31.730 --> 06:27:31.740 align:start position:0%
percent of our adolescents had Dental
 
06:27:33.410 --> 06:27:33.420 align:start position:0%
fluorosis Dental fluorosis is a
 
06:27:36.590 --> 06:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
biomarker of overexposure ingesting too
 
06:27:38.810 --> 06:27:38.820 align:start position:0%
much fluoride in infancy you see it in
 
06:27:40.730 --> 06:27:40.740 align:start position:0%
the white and brown splotches on the
 
06:27:43.310 --> 06:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
teeth the same people that opposed that
 
06:27:45.470 --> 06:27:45.480 align:start position:0%
bill are here today posing this bill for
 
06:27:47.990 --> 06:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
these very same reasons you and your
 
06:27:49.970 --> 06:27:49.980 align:start position:0%
wisdom looked at the cdc's own data and
 
06:27:52.310 --> 06:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
decided wait a minute Stuart and fan are
 
06:27:55.128 --> 06:27:55.138 align:start position:0%
correct we are over exposing our systems
 
06:27:57.890 --> 06:27:57.900 align:start position:0%
and you pass a bill that now is codified
 
06:28:01.368 --> 06:28:01.378 align:start position:0%
into law which warns citizens not to
 
06:28:02.868 --> 06:28:02.878 align:start position:0%
reconstitute infant formula with
 
06:28:04.910 --> 06:28:04.920 align:start position:0%
fluoridated water so what we're doing
 
06:28:07.850 --> 06:28:07.860 align:start position:0%
now is since 2017 there have been about
 
06:28:10.788 --> 06:28:10.798 align:start position:0%
10 nih-funded studies looking at
 
06:28:13.430 --> 06:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
fluoride and in Florida communities
 
06:28:15.890 --> 06:28:15.900 align:start position:0%
primarily in North America and the link
 
06:28:18.590 --> 06:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
to developmental neurotoxicity guess
 
06:28:20.270 --> 06:28:20.280 align:start position:0%
what every single one of them has found
 
06:28:22.190 --> 06:28:22.200 align:start position:0%
a link to developmental neurotoxicity
 
06:28:25.548 --> 06:28:25.558 align:start position:0%
every single one and I think you've sent
 
06:28:27.410 --> 06:28:27.420 align:start position:0%
you've seen some of that I've provided
 
06:28:29.330 --> 06:28:29.340 align:start position:0%
that data I also provide you an op-ed
 
06:28:31.250 --> 06:28:31.260 align:start position:0%
from the former director of the national
 
06:28:34.128 --> 06:28:34.138 align:start position:0%
toxicology program Linda Birnbaum saying
 
06:28:36.410 --> 06:28:36.420 align:start position:0%
I hope policy makers take notice of this
 
06:28:38.750 --> 06:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
and do something about it and I'd urge
 
06:28:41.330 --> 06:28:41.340 align:start position:0%
you to read that that person's uh op-ed
 
06:28:44.090 --> 06:28:44.100 align:start position:0%
I only have three minutes but this bill
 
06:28:45.590 --> 06:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
does nothing to change fluoridation
 
06:28:49.610 --> 06:28:49.620 align:start position:0%
policy it's a study and I trust you with
 
06:28:51.890 --> 06:28:51.900 align:start position:0%
looking at the data I'm not saying don't
 
06:28:54.048 --> 06:28:54.058 align:start position:0%
look at the data trust me I'm saying no
 
06:28:56.628 --> 06:28:56.638 align:start position:0%
I trust you look at the data to please I
 
06:28:58.010 --> 06:28:58.020 align:start position:0%
think you'll be shocked at what you find
 
06:29:00.590 --> 06:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
and it may end up in saying hey maybe we
 
06:29:02.510 --> 06:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
need a commission of scientists or
 
06:29:04.070 --> 06:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
something to study it or maybe we just
 
06:29:05.510 --> 06:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
need to have a warning for pregnant
 
06:29:07.970 --> 06:29:07.980 align:start position:0%
women so the IQ has dropped doesn't
 
06:29:09.410 --> 06:29:09.420 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean or maybe we love
 
06:29:11.090 --> 06:29:11.100 align:start position:0%
fluoridation and everybody should do it
 
06:29:13.850 --> 06:29:13.860 align:start position:0%
I leave that in your hands I think my
 
06:29:15.650 --> 06:29:15.660 align:start position:0%
job is just provide the studies to you
 
06:29:17.270 --> 06:29:17.280 align:start position:0%
all of them not just cherry pick them
 
06:29:19.250 --> 06:29:19.260 align:start position:0%
but all of them and leave it in your
 
06:29:21.590 --> 06:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
hands why is this important right now
 
06:29:25.070 --> 06:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
well guess what in a couple weeks the
 
06:29:27.530 --> 06:29:27.540 align:start position:0%
national toxicology program is about to
 
06:29:30.410 --> 06:29:30.420 align:start position:0%
publish their final draft of a word
 
06:29:31.970 --> 06:29:31.980 align:start position:0%
study they've done for many years you
 
06:29:33.708 --> 06:29:33.718 align:start position:0%
haven't heard about it I'm shocked that
 
06:29:35.448 --> 06:29:35.458 align:start position:0%
the bureaucrats here in New Hampshire
 
06:29:36.770 --> 06:29:36.780 align:start position:0%
haven't brought this to your attention
 
06:29:38.930 --> 06:29:38.940 align:start position:0%
but they've studied Developmental
 
06:29:40.548 --> 06:29:40.558 align:start position:0%
neurotoxicity and this research that
 
06:29:42.770 --> 06:29:42.780 align:start position:0%
they funded over the years and let's
 
06:29:44.868 --> 06:29:44.878 align:start position:0%
just say the drafts that they've
 
06:29:46.730 --> 06:29:46.740 align:start position:0%
supplied to the public have have said
 
06:29:49.190 --> 06:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
it's a presumed developmental neurotoxin
 
06:29:50.570 --> 06:29:50.580 align:start position:0%
the fact that this hasn't been brought
 
06:29:52.970 --> 06:29:52.980 align:start position:0%
to your attention already is abysmal and
 
06:29:54.770 --> 06:29:54.780 align:start position:0%
you should be concerned that it hasn't
 
06:29:56.448 --> 06:29:56.458 align:start position:0%
brought to you attention as well as now
 
06:29:58.368 --> 06:29:58.378 align:start position:0%
the dental fluorosis rate when I came in
 
06:30:01.730 --> 06:30:01.740 align:start position:0%
2012 it was at 41 the CDC now says it's
 
06:30:04.070 --> 06:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
at 70 percent 70 percent of our
 
06:30:05.628 --> 06:30:05.638 align:start position:0%
adolescents now have dental fluorosis
 
06:30:08.390 --> 06:30:08.400 align:start position:0%
you guys have had 20 years to act and we
 
06:30:09.708 --> 06:30:09.718 align:start position:0%
can't wait for the federal government to
 
06:30:11.570 --> 06:30:11.580 align:start position:0%
do it and we can't wait several more
 
06:30:14.090 --> 06:30:14.100 align:start position:0%
years for other people that promoted the
 
06:30:15.890 --> 06:30:15.900 align:start position:0%
practice for 75 years to get on board
 
06:30:18.110 --> 06:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
that's why we're giving you you the data
 
06:30:20.930 --> 06:30:20.940 align:start position:0%
we're hoping that researchers will reach
 
06:30:22.190 --> 06:30:22.200 align:start position:0%
out to you and you can ask them
 
06:30:24.350 --> 06:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
questions not special interests not
 
06:30:26.390 --> 06:30:26.400 align:start position:0%
lobbyists but actual the authors of
 
06:30:28.730 --> 06:30:28.740 align:start position:0%
these studies and I think it'll be
 
06:30:31.670 --> 06:30:31.680 align:start position:0%
rarely informative to uh for all of you
 
06:30:35.330 --> 06:30:35.340 align:start position:0%
um it's not wrapping up okay uh I guess
 
06:30:37.610 --> 06:30:37.620 align:start position:0%
I'll just say I've supplied the
 
06:30:38.990 --> 06:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
information I've supplied the studies
 
06:30:40.128 --> 06:30:40.138 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be sending you an email
 
06:30:43.788 --> 06:30:43.798 align:start position:0%
with video presentations all short from
 
06:30:45.948 --> 06:30:45.958 align:start position:0%
some of these authors as well as the
 
06:30:47.930 --> 06:30:47.940 align:start position:0%
former ntp director and I urge you to
 
06:30:50.208 --> 06:30:50.218 align:start position:0%
please watch these videos don't trust me
 
06:30:52.430 --> 06:30:52.440 align:start position:0%
don't trust them you know look at the
 
06:30:54.230 --> 06:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
data yourself you guys are wise enough
 
06:30:56.090 --> 06:30:56.100 align:start position:0%
thank you and I support the this and
 
06:30:57.650 --> 06:30:57.660 align:start position:0%
open up questions thank you our
 
06:30:59.448 --> 06:30:59.458 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman
 
06:31:01.490 --> 06:31:01.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman you read my mind I
 
06:31:03.350 --> 06:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
didn't write in my hand but you would
 
06:31:04.670 --> 06:31:04.680 align:start position:0%
wait a moment ago
 
06:31:06.948 --> 06:31:06.958 align:start position:0%
I was just telling you about the time
 
06:31:09.048 --> 06:31:09.058 align:start position:0%
um oh I'm sorry that's okay I do have a
 
06:31:11.510 --> 06:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
question uh is that
 
06:31:13.548 --> 06:31:13.558 align:start position:0%
um do you know if that statute requiring
 
06:31:15.770 --> 06:31:15.780 align:start position:0%
the warning for pregnant women is that
 
06:31:18.470 --> 06:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
in uh and reconstituting baby formulas
 
06:31:21.110 --> 06:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
that's still in effect oh yeah yep it's
 
06:31:22.548 --> 06:31:22.558 align:start position:0%
still a law here in New Hampshire has to
 
06:31:24.288 --> 06:31:24.298 align:start position:0%
be on the water Consumer Reports the
 
06:31:25.670 --> 06:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
ghost all water consumers and Florida
 
06:31:27.890 --> 06:31:27.900 align:start position:0%
communities thank you which are 12 of
 
06:31:29.628 --> 06:31:29.638 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire representative
 
06:31:31.548 --> 06:31:31.558 align:start position:0%
Shapiro thank you Mr chairman and just
 
06:31:31.558 --> 06:31:32.690 align:start position:0%
Shapiro thank you Mr chairman and just
quickly

06:31:32.690 --> 06:31:32.700 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
06:31:35.750 --> 06:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
um is there fluoride in water naturally
 
06:31:38.570 --> 06:31:38.580 align:start position:0%
as well as in um introduced into
 
06:31:40.670 --> 06:31:40.680 align:start position:0%
Municipal Water Systems yep typically
 
06:31:43.490 --> 06:31:43.500 align:start position:0%
groundwater is about 0.1 part per
 
06:31:45.288 --> 06:31:45.298 align:start position:0%
million and when we introduce it
 
06:31:47.510 --> 06:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
chemically it increases at 700 percent
 
06:31:51.110 --> 06:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
to about 0.7 there are some about it's
 
06:31:52.548 --> 06:31:52.558 align:start position:0%
about I don't know less than five
 
06:31:54.410 --> 06:31:54.420 align:start position:0%
percent of the communities like Grantham
 
06:31:57.650 --> 06:31:57.660 align:start position:0%
for instance that has natural phosphorus
 
06:31:59.690 --> 06:31:59.700 align:start position:0%
you know bedrock and stuff and they have
 
06:32:02.270 --> 06:32:02.280 align:start position:0%
levels naturally about one and there are
 
06:32:03.890 --> 06:32:03.900 align:start position:0%
some communities up in the mountains
 
06:32:07.010 --> 06:32:07.020 align:start position:0%
smaller that have higher levels like 0.2
 
06:32:10.610 --> 06:32:10.620 align:start position:0%
or pardon me 2.0 or four so these this
 
06:32:12.708 --> 06:32:12.718 align:start position:0%
bill would affect those people as well
 
06:32:16.970 --> 06:32:16.980 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:19.128 --> 06:32:19.138 align:start position:0%
you have another one representative
 
06:32:21.530 --> 06:32:21.540 align:start position:0%
Coachman uh someone had asked and I
 
06:32:24.170 --> 06:32:24.180 align:start position:0%
wanted to hear the answer but um no one
 
06:32:26.330 --> 06:32:26.340 align:start position:0%
had given it so thank you for uh
 
06:32:30.110 --> 06:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
indulging me is uh are there other are
 
06:32:31.670 --> 06:32:31.680 align:start position:0%
there parts of the country that are
 
06:32:32.930 --> 06:32:32.940 align:start position:0%
looking at this issue like
 
06:32:35.030 --> 06:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities or states or anything
 
06:32:36.890 --> 06:32:36.900 align:start position:0%
like that that are that are re
 
06:32:39.410 --> 06:32:39.420 align:start position:0%
reevaluating based on these safety
 
06:32:41.810 --> 06:32:41.820 align:start position:0%
concerns yes there's a I mean just
 
06:32:43.250 --> 06:32:43.260 align:start position:0%
legislatively there's a bill in Oklahoma
 
06:32:45.530 --> 06:32:45.540 align:start position:0%
to prohibit fluoridation there's a bill
 
06:32:47.090 --> 06:32:47.100 align:start position:0%
in a Hawaii
 
06:32:49.788 --> 06:32:49.798 align:start position:0%
to prohibit fluoridation State College
 
06:32:53.030 --> 06:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
PA their water authority is made up of
 
06:32:55.850 --> 06:32:55.860 align:start position:0%
seven phds from Penn State and they just
 
06:32:58.128 --> 06:32:58.138 align:start position:0%
voted after years of research to end
 
06:33:02.270 --> 06:33:02.280 align:start position:0%
fluoridation and just so yes it's we're
 
06:33:04.250 --> 06:33:04.260 align:start position:0%
seeing a Groundswell and we're now
 
06:33:06.310 --> 06:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
hearing because the ntp report of state
 
06:33:08.230 --> 06:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
epidemiologists now
 
06:33:10.730 --> 06:33:10.740 align:start position:0%
having major concerns and no longer
 
06:33:12.530 --> 06:33:12.540 align:start position:0%
endorsing the practice because of the
 
06:33:14.230 --> 06:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
government-funded studies yep
 
06:33:16.490 --> 06:33:16.500 align:start position:0%
representative King thank you chairman
 
06:33:18.110 --> 06:33:18.120 align:start position:0%
McDonald thank you for taking questions
 
06:33:21.530 --> 06:33:21.540 align:start position:0%
is it your understanding that this
 
06:33:24.288 --> 06:33:24.298 align:start position:0%
really isn't a partisan issue and that
 
06:33:26.628 --> 06:33:26.638 align:start position:0%
there are both blue and red states that
 
06:33:29.350 --> 06:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
have either stopped or never were taking
 
06:33:32.030 --> 06:33:32.040 align:start position:0%
uh or fluoridating their water thank you
 
06:33:33.770 --> 06:33:33.780 align:start position:0%
yeah this is absolutely nonpartisan
 
06:33:35.208 --> 06:33:35.218 align:start position:0%
whatsoever I mean the makeup of our
 
06:33:38.510 --> 06:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
organization we have people on all sides
 
06:33:41.390 --> 06:33:41.400 align:start position:0%
um right now Senator gabbard a democrat
 
06:33:43.510 --> 06:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
in Hawaii has a bill
 
06:33:45.650 --> 06:33:45.660 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support in Kentucky for a
 
06:33:47.270 --> 06:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
bill there to prohibit fluoridation
 
06:33:50.030 --> 06:33:50.040 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support here on our bill we
 
06:33:51.530 --> 06:33:51.540 align:start position:0%
have Republicans and Democrats this is
 
06:33:52.970 --> 06:33:52.980 align:start position:0%
not political
 
06:33:54.170 --> 06:33:54.180 align:start position:0%
um and we have people on both sides of
 
06:33:55.190 --> 06:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
the vaccine issue you probably don't
 
06:33:56.930 --> 06:33:56.940 align:start position:0%
want to hear about but it's like this is
 
06:33:58.788 --> 06:33:58.798 align:start position:0%
a water issue this is a water safety
 
06:34:00.948 --> 06:34:00.958 align:start position:0%
issue has nothing to do with politics
 
06:34:03.708 --> 06:34:03.718 align:start position:0%
from our perspective thank you other
 
06:34:03.718 --> 06:34:05.208 align:start position:0%
from our perspective thank you other
questions

06:34:05.208 --> 06:34:05.218 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:34:07.610 --> 06:34:07.620 align:start position:0%
yes representative Nagel thank you Mr
 
06:34:10.970 --> 06:34:10.980 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks for taking my question
 
06:34:13.368 --> 06:34:13.378 align:start position:0%
um the dental issue is a huge issue
 
06:34:15.890 --> 06:34:15.900 align:start position:0%
um in terms of Public Health and and our
 
06:34:18.048 --> 06:34:18.058 align:start position:0%
introduction of fluoridation one way or
 
06:34:20.390 --> 06:34:20.400 align:start position:0%
another has dramatically improved Dental
 
06:34:22.490 --> 06:34:22.500 align:start position:0%
Health in this country and health in
 
06:34:24.708 --> 06:34:24.718 align:start position:0%
general I'm just curious these other
 
06:34:27.350 --> 06:34:27.360 align:start position:0%
places what strategies they use to make
 
06:34:29.930 --> 06:34:29.940 align:start position:0%
sure that that public health measure
 
06:34:31.250 --> 06:34:31.260 align:start position:0%
doesn't go away
 
06:34:33.650 --> 06:34:33.660 align:start position:0%
that's a good thank you yeah that's a
 
06:34:36.230 --> 06:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
good question so probably a good example
 
06:34:38.510 --> 06:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
uh well here in the United States what's
 
06:34:40.610 --> 06:34:40.620 align:start position:0%
what they're utilizing are school-based
 
06:34:42.770 --> 06:34:42.780 align:start position:0%
programs School ceiling programs topical
 
06:34:44.510 --> 06:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
fluoride programs School seal and
 
06:34:47.090 --> 06:34:47.100 align:start position:0%
screening programs we've also seen the
 
06:34:49.610 --> 06:34:49.620 align:start position:0%
usage of mid-level providers see it's
 
06:34:52.490 --> 06:34:52.500 align:start position:0%
about getting access to dental care it's
 
06:34:54.650 --> 06:34:54.660 align:start position:0%
about using topical fluoride it's not
 
06:34:58.070 --> 06:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
about ingesting fluoride uh so and and
 
06:34:59.690 --> 06:34:59.700 align:start position:0%
one of the probably one of the countries
 
06:35:01.910 --> 06:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
Scotland had reduced their childhood
 
06:35:04.490 --> 06:35:04.500 align:start position:0%
decay in school by 70 percent they don't
 
06:35:05.990 --> 06:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
use fluoridated water they use a
 
06:35:08.448 --> 06:35:08.458 align:start position:0%
school-based program
 
06:35:12.048 --> 06:35:12.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:14.030 --> 06:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
so you know other questions thank you
 
06:35:16.788 --> 06:35:16.798 align:start position:0%
thank you

in the Concord area where we treat
 
06:35:45.230 --> 06:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
hundreds of children every year
 
06:35:45.240 --> 06:35:45.770 align:start position:0%
hundreds of children every year
um

06:35:45.770 --> 06:35:45.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:35:49.910 --> 06:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:52.910 --> 06:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
okay did I repeat what I just said okay
 
06:35:54.470 --> 06:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
I'm a practicing dentist I've been
 
06:35:56.690 --> 06:35:56.700 align:start position:0%
practicing for almost 30 years I'm also
 
06:35:58.548 --> 06:35:58.558 align:start position:0%
a supervising dentist for 10 public
 
06:36:00.708 --> 06:36:00.718 align:start position:0%
schools in the area of the Concord area
 
06:36:02.990 --> 06:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
and it's surrounding towns I'm a
 
06:36:05.090 --> 06:36:05.100 align:start position:0%
proponent for fluoride in safe levels
 
06:36:06.948 --> 06:36:06.958 align:start position:0%
like we have it currently in our in our
 
06:36:09.110 --> 06:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
water systems I understand that this
 
06:36:11.448 --> 06:36:11.458 align:start position:0%
this bill is for a study
 
06:36:12.948 --> 06:36:12.958 align:start position:0%
um just hearing what everybody's saying
 
06:36:15.288 --> 06:36:15.298 align:start position:0%
today I just want to reflectively say
 
06:36:17.690 --> 06:36:17.700 align:start position:0%
it's not that we're against a study I'm
 
06:36:19.850 --> 06:36:19.860 align:start position:0%
for every part of Education possible I
 
06:36:21.590 --> 06:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
love to see people read I encourage all
 
06:36:23.868 --> 06:36:23.878 align:start position:0%
the kids I see in schools to read and I
 
06:36:25.548 --> 06:36:25.558 align:start position:0%
want you guys to read everything you can
 
06:36:27.890 --> 06:36:27.900 align:start position:0%
as well we're not against a study in any
 
06:36:30.650 --> 06:36:30.660 align:start position:0%
way shape or form what we want though is
 
06:36:32.990 --> 06:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
that you're looking at the proper proper
 
06:36:35.570 --> 06:36:35.580 align:start position:0%
studies the proper material I've been
 
06:36:37.070 --> 06:36:37.080 align:start position:0%
testifying here some of you may
 
06:36:39.230 --> 06:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
recognize me I've been testifying here
 
06:36:42.230 --> 06:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
for almost six or seven years and one
 
06:36:44.690 --> 06:36:44.700 align:start position:0%
year that I came I said I want to see
 
06:36:47.690 --> 06:36:47.700 align:start position:0%
the opposition's information that
 
06:36:49.430 --> 06:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
they're presenting I want to read it so
 
06:36:51.470 --> 06:36:51.480 align:start position:0%
for a couple nights prior to coming I
 
06:36:54.110 --> 06:36:54.120 align:start position:0%
read about 80 pages is and as a mother
 
06:36:56.628 --> 06:36:56.638 align:start position:0%
as a teacher and as a professional in
 
06:36:57.830 --> 06:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
the community
 
06:37:00.048 --> 06:37:00.058 align:start position:0%
if I didn't have my science background I
 
06:37:01.250 --> 06:37:01.260 align:start position:0%
might have walked in here that day and
 
06:37:02.750 --> 06:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
said I'm scared of having fluoride in
 
06:37:04.128 --> 06:37:04.138 align:start position:0%
the water
 
06:37:05.930 --> 06:37:05.940 align:start position:0%
because those studies could lead you to
 
06:37:08.150 --> 06:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
be to think bad why did I think
 
06:37:09.770 --> 06:37:09.780 align:start position:0%
different as I read those studies
 
06:37:11.690 --> 06:37:11.700 align:start position:0%
because I have a science background and
 
06:37:13.250 --> 06:37:13.260 align:start position:0%
I know you need to have double-blind
 
06:37:15.170 --> 06:37:15.180 align:start position:0%
studies that are cross-sectional you
 
06:37:17.990 --> 06:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
can't use anecdotal situations and much
 
06:37:20.628 --> 06:37:20.638 align:start position:0%
of those 80 pages that I read were that
 
06:37:24.350 --> 06:37:24.360 align:start position:0%
so in going forward if you do decide to
 
06:37:26.448 --> 06:37:26.458 align:start position:0%
go through with a study which I do think
 
06:37:28.430 --> 06:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
is a waste of time just honestly but I
 
06:37:30.470 --> 06:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
would never discard you from doing that
 
06:37:33.770 --> 06:37:33.780 align:start position:0%
I what I want most is that you read the
 
06:37:36.948 --> 06:37:36.958 align:start position:0%
proper materials and bring in the proper
 
06:37:38.868 --> 06:37:38.878 align:start position:0%
professionals the proper scientists the
 
06:37:40.490 --> 06:37:40.500 align:start position:0%
proper researchers because I can tell
 
06:37:42.770 --> 06:37:42.780 align:start position:0%
you honestly in this room as much
 
06:37:44.810 --> 06:37:44.820 align:start position:0%
knowledge as I as I have I don't have
 
06:37:46.610 --> 06:37:46.620 align:start position:0%
the studies memorized and I'm not the
 
06:37:47.930 --> 06:37:47.940 align:start position:0%
person that should just sit here and
 
06:37:49.190 --> 06:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
speak to you if you're going to make the
 
06:37:51.230 --> 06:37:51.240 align:start position:0%
decision to remove fluoride out of the
 
06:37:53.030 --> 06:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
water I can only tell you what I've seen
 
06:37:56.090 --> 06:37:56.100 align:start position:0%
over my 30 years of practice and what I
 
06:37:58.730 --> 06:37:58.740 align:start position:0%
know and what should what I think should
 
06:38:00.410 --> 06:38:00.420 align:start position:0%
be done based on the studies I've read
 
06:38:02.990 --> 06:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
but you should have a professional and
 
06:38:04.368 --> 06:38:04.378 align:start position:0%
and that's what you would need in that
 
06:38:07.850 --> 06:38:07.860 align:start position:0%
study bring the right people in and you
 
06:38:09.770 --> 06:38:09.780 align:start position:0%
know there there are studies that are
 
06:38:12.288 --> 06:38:12.298 align:start position:0%
even currently as in as in 2020 that
 
06:38:14.570 --> 06:38:14.580 align:start position:0%
will explain the what fluoride does for
 
06:38:18.530 --> 06:38:18.540 align:start position:0%
children yes fluorosis is a fact do you
 
06:38:20.510 --> 06:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
want one little pitiflarosis like I have
 
06:38:22.190 --> 06:38:22.200 align:start position:0%
on on my front tooth that none of you
 
06:38:24.410 --> 06:38:24.420 align:start position:0%
can probably see I would be one in that
 
06:38:26.208 --> 06:38:26.218 align:start position:0%
study and that 70 percent that it's gone
 
06:38:28.190 --> 06:38:28.200 align:start position:0%
up to that little pit on my front tooth
 
06:38:30.410 --> 06:38:30.420 align:start position:0%
would put me into that study but I'd
 
06:38:32.030 --> 06:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
much rather that little pit on my front
 
06:38:33.770 --> 06:38:33.780 align:start position:0%
tooth and a big hole in my back tooth
 
06:38:35.570 --> 06:38:35.580 align:start position:0%
that requires a root canal crown and
 
06:38:37.910 --> 06:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
extraction or an implant I don't want to
 
06:38:39.170 --> 06:38:39.180 align:start position:0%
see children go through the pain and
 
06:38:40.850 --> 06:38:40.860 align:start position:0%
suffering that we've seen children go
 
06:38:42.590 --> 06:38:42.600 align:start position:0%
through for many many years because they
 
06:38:44.390 --> 06:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
didn't have fluoride or currently still
 
06:38:46.490 --> 06:38:46.500 align:start position:0%
don't have fluoride that's what I want
 
06:38:47.868 --> 06:38:47.878 align:start position:0%
to prevent I want to make it safe for
 
06:38:49.250 --> 06:38:49.260 align:start position:0%
all the children and prevent the pain
 
06:38:50.868 --> 06:38:50.878 align:start position:0%
and suffering that they don't need to
 
06:38:52.430 --> 06:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
have based on the science and research
 
06:38:55.128 --> 06:38:55.138 align:start position:0%
that we have today
 
06:38:56.990 --> 06:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
thank you questions representative King
 
06:38:58.970 --> 06:38:58.980 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman McDonald
 
06:39:00.288 --> 06:39:00.298 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned that and thank you for
 
06:39:02.448 --> 06:39:02.458 align:start position:0%
taking questions uh you mentioned that
 
06:39:04.548 --> 06:39:04.558 align:start position:0%
you want us to look at the proper
 
06:39:06.350 --> 06:39:06.360 align:start position:0%
studies and I'm just curious if you
 
06:39:08.868 --> 06:39:08.878 align:start position:0%
would consider uh the National Institute
 
06:39:10.250 --> 06:39:10.260 align:start position:0%
of Health the Journal of the American
 
06:39:12.230 --> 06:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
Medical Association and the national
 
06:39:15.288 --> 06:39:15.298 align:start position:0%
toxicology program to be valid studies
 
06:39:17.628 --> 06:39:17.638 align:start position:0%
thank you I'd have to see the study
 
06:39:19.548 --> 06:39:19.558 align:start position:0%
myself and I'd want to read through it
 
06:39:22.670 --> 06:39:22.680 align:start position:0%
but yeah those are valid resources
 
06:39:24.288 --> 06:39:24.298 align:start position:0%
other questions just representative
 
06:39:24.298 --> 06:39:25.430 align:start position:0%
other questions just representative
Palmer

06:39:25.430 --> 06:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
Palmer
 
06:39:27.830 --> 06:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
so what was brought up a little while
 
06:39:30.410 --> 06:39:30.420 align:start position:0%
ago was the application of fluoride on
 
06:39:32.628 --> 06:39:32.638 align:start position:0%
teeth and my question is if we start
 
06:39:35.868 --> 06:39:35.878 align:start position:0%
looking at Alternatives what's the Gap
 
06:39:38.690 --> 06:39:38.700 align:start position:0%
now if if you took all the fluoride out
 
06:39:40.128 --> 06:39:40.138 align:start position:0%
of water and you just said we're going
 
06:39:43.010 --> 06:39:43.020 align:start position:0%
to just apply it how how big a project
 
06:39:45.470 --> 06:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
is that and how many kids are being
 
06:39:47.330 --> 06:39:47.340 align:start position:0%
missed or would be missed well
 
06:39:50.030 --> 06:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely many children would be missed
 
06:39:51.830 --> 06:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
um you know if I look at the schools
 
06:39:54.288 --> 06:39:54.298 align:start position:0%
that I see a lot of underserved children
 
06:39:55.850 --> 06:39:55.860 align:start position:0%
in I won't speak from my private
 
06:39:57.230 --> 06:39:57.240 align:start position:0%
practice because these are mostly
 
06:39:58.548 --> 06:39:58.558 align:start position:0%
families that are coming in that have
 
06:40:01.490 --> 06:40:01.500 align:start position:0%
regular dental care so if I speak to the
 
06:40:03.948 --> 06:40:03.958 align:start position:0%
school programs that I'm seeing a lot of
 
06:40:05.030 --> 06:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
these children don't even have a
 
06:40:07.128 --> 06:40:07.138 align:start position:0%
toothbrush in their home many times we
 
06:40:08.750 --> 06:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
give them a toothbrush and they say do I
 
06:40:10.788 --> 06:40:10.798 align:start position:0%
continue to share this with everyone
 
06:40:12.830 --> 06:40:12.840 align:start position:0%
they're sharing one toothbrush with five
 
06:40:15.708 --> 06:40:15.718 align:start position:0%
children sometimes so they don't have
 
06:40:17.510 --> 06:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
access to care they don't have access to
 
06:40:19.730 --> 06:40:19.740 align:start position:0%
care in their own home so without
 
06:40:21.530 --> 06:40:21.540 align:start position:0%
fluoride in the water many of them are
 
06:40:22.850 --> 06:40:22.860 align:start position:0%
not going to have toothpaste at home to
 
06:40:25.250 --> 06:40:25.260 align:start position:0%
use it's it's still happening today so
 
06:40:26.868 --> 06:40:26.878 align:start position:0%
many people think this is something of
 
06:40:29.090 --> 06:40:29.100 align:start position:0%
the 60s and 70s it's not it's happening
 
06:40:29.100 --> 06:40:30.590 align:start position:0%
the 60s and 70s it's not it's happening
today

06:40:30.590 --> 06:40:30.600 align:start position:0%
today
 
06:40:32.868 --> 06:40:32.878 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
06:40:34.970 --> 06:40:34.980 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel thank you Mr
 
06:40:37.128 --> 06:40:37.138 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks for taking my question I
 
06:40:38.868 --> 06:40:38.878 align:start position:0%
have to say when we started this process
 
06:40:41.750 --> 06:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
I kind of shared your cynicism we just
 
06:40:43.730 --> 06:40:43.740 align:start position:0%
did an entertaining literature search
 
06:40:45.350 --> 06:40:45.360 align:start position:0%
here and it became convinced that
 
06:40:47.090 --> 06:40:47.100 align:start position:0%
there's two separate potential Public
 
06:40:49.368 --> 06:40:49.378 align:start position:0%
Health crises here and it's not the mark
 
06:40:51.590 --> 06:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
and the tooth but the developmental
 
06:40:53.750 --> 06:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
disabilities and in the children's a big
 
06:40:57.350 --> 06:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
issue um what I'm wondering about maybe
 
06:40:59.510 --> 06:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to convince you of something
 
06:40:59.520 --> 06:41:01.128 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to convince you of something
um

06:41:01.128 --> 06:41:01.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:41:04.128 --> 06:41:04.138 align:start position:0%
we may not be talking about you know an
 
06:41:06.048 --> 06:41:06.058 align:start position:0%
amount fluoride in the water but a
 
06:41:07.490 --> 06:41:07.500 align:start position:0%
certain amount that's important and I
 
06:41:09.830 --> 06:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
think we do have to have a discussion at
 
06:41:11.690 --> 06:41:11.700 align:start position:0%
a public level about that or alternative
 
06:41:14.030 --> 06:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
strategies to get and I'm curious what
 
06:41:15.770 --> 06:41:15.780 align:start position:0%
your thoughts are about that and if that
 
06:41:17.208 --> 06:41:17.218 align:start position:0%
changes your point of view on whether
 
06:41:19.128 --> 06:41:19.138 align:start position:0%
this committee is important
 
06:41:20.990 --> 06:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
are you referencing
 
06:41:23.390 --> 06:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
um like changing the amount from the 0.7
 
06:41:26.890 --> 06:41:26.900 align:start position:0%
milligrams per liter or yeah
 
06:41:29.570 --> 06:41:29.580 align:start position:0%
that are alternative strategies to get
 
06:41:31.970 --> 06:41:31.980 align:start position:0%
Florida on kids I guess what the only
 
06:41:34.850 --> 06:41:34.860 align:start position:0%
thing I could say is the 0.7 milligrams
 
06:41:36.890 --> 06:41:36.900 align:start position:0%
per liter that's been studied has been
 
06:41:38.448 --> 06:41:38.458 align:start position:0%
shown to be very safe and effective
 
06:41:41.330 --> 06:41:41.340 align:start position:0%
especially in a state like New Hampshire
 
06:41:43.490 --> 06:41:43.500 align:start position:0%
where it's not a hot area like there's
 
06:41:46.128 --> 06:41:46.138 align:start position:0%
been studies in places like Sudan where
 
06:41:47.628 --> 06:41:47.638 align:start position:0%
the climate's very very hot and they
 
06:41:49.910 --> 06:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
might drink a far more excessive amounts
 
06:41:52.070 --> 06:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
of water than a place like New Hampshire
 
06:41:54.590 --> 06:41:54.600 align:start position:0%
and as I noticed a question came up
 
06:41:57.230 --> 06:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
earlier today about different areas and
 
06:41:59.330 --> 06:41:59.340 align:start position:0%
and you know it's climate and Geographic
 
06:42:01.788 --> 06:42:01.798 align:start position:0%
and geologic uh based on you know what's
 
06:42:03.770 --> 06:42:03.780 align:start position:0%
in the water you know in terms of rock
 
06:42:06.708 --> 06:42:06.718 align:start position:0%
beds and things like that but am I
 
06:42:08.990 --> 06:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
helping answering a lot I learned a lot
 
06:42:11.690 --> 06:42:11.700 align:start position:0%
about Flora in the last 20 minutes okay
 
06:42:11.700 --> 06:42:13.670 align:start position:0%
about Flora in the last 20 minutes okay
representative

06:42:13.670 --> 06:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:42:15.770 --> 06:42:15.780 align:start position:0%
would you believe from the quick
 
06:42:19.730 --> 06:42:19.740 align:start position:0%
research I just did only 22 towns in New
 
06:42:21.708 --> 06:42:21.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire have fluoride in their water
 
06:42:25.730 --> 06:42:25.740 align:start position:0%
and 199 do not I do believe that I know
 
06:42:27.948 --> 06:42:27.958 align:start position:0%
the number and it saddens me I will say
 
06:42:29.990 --> 06:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
that I've practiced in Chicago Rhode
 
06:42:31.970 --> 06:42:31.980 align:start position:0%
Island and New Hampshire and I started
 
06:42:33.470 --> 06:42:33.480 align:start position:0%
practicing when I first came to New
 
06:42:35.628 --> 06:42:35.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in Bedford on the border of
 
06:42:37.368 --> 06:42:37.378 align:start position:0%
Manchester and when I saw the number of
 
06:42:40.128 --> 06:42:40.138 align:start position:0%
children with cavities I I was confused
 
06:42:42.350 --> 06:42:42.360 align:start position:0%
I I'd never seen this many cavities in
 
06:42:44.390 --> 06:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
children's mouths and so I asked that
 
06:42:45.890 --> 06:42:45.900 align:start position:0%
gentleman that I was practicing with I
 
06:42:47.990 --> 06:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
said I've only been out of school for
 
06:42:50.150 --> 06:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
five years so it was Chicago and Rhode
 
06:42:51.890 --> 06:42:51.900 align:start position:0%
Island but I feel like I'm in a third
 
06:42:53.990 --> 06:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
world country and he said well there's
 
06:42:56.030 --> 06:42:56.040 align:start position:0%
no Floyd in the Manchester Water and
 
06:42:57.830 --> 06:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
there's no fluoride in many of their
 
06:43:00.288 --> 06:43:00.298 align:start position:0%
homes because they're on well water and
 
06:43:02.270 --> 06:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
unless we educate them to be on fluoride
 
06:43:04.070 --> 06:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
tablets and educate them on what's
 
06:43:05.868 --> 06:43:05.878 align:start position:0%
happening this is why you're seeing that
 
06:43:07.730 --> 06:43:07.740 align:start position:0%
and I didn't see that in inner city
 
06:43:09.410 --> 06:43:09.420 align:start position:0%
Chicago I didn't see the Decay that I
 
06:43:10.910 --> 06:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
was seeing in a private practice and on
 
06:43:13.190 --> 06:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
the Bedford Manchester line
 
06:43:15.410 --> 06:43:15.420 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
06:43:18.288 --> 06:43:18.298 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman thank you Mr
 
06:43:19.548 --> 06:43:19.558 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
06:43:19.558 --> 06:43:20.690 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
question

06:43:20.690 --> 06:43:20.700 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:43:22.128 --> 06:43:22.138 align:start position:0%
um what you said just conflicted with
 
06:43:24.830 --> 06:43:24.840 align:start position:0%
the previous testimony or from the
 
06:43:24.840 --> 06:43:26.510 align:start position:0%
the previous testimony or from the
introduction

06:43:26.510 --> 06:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
introduction
 
06:43:28.010 --> 06:43:28.020 align:start position:0%
um it's my understanding that Manchester
 
06:43:32.330 --> 06:43:32.340 align:start position:0%
Water Works and the every town that that
 
06:43:34.610 --> 06:43:34.620 align:start position:0%
um serves does have Florida apparently
 
06:43:36.770 --> 06:43:36.780 align:start position:0%
fluoridated okay so when at that time
 
06:43:39.350 --> 06:43:39.360 align:start position:0%
right when I first came yeah okay and
 
06:43:41.090 --> 06:43:41.100 align:start position:0%
have you seen
 
06:43:43.310 --> 06:43:43.320 align:start position:0%
um in in that area have you seen the
 
06:43:45.890 --> 06:43:45.900 align:start position:0%
rates decrease since then I don't
 
06:43:47.930 --> 06:43:47.940 align:start position:0%
practice there I practice in Concord now
 
06:43:49.430 --> 06:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
it's just when I first had moved here
 
06:43:53.270 --> 06:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions
 
06:43:56.448 --> 06:43:56.458 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you and
 
06:43:57.830 --> 06:43:57.840 align:start position:0%

06:44:12.650 --> 06:44:12.660 align:start position:0%
you've asked for eight minutes sir I'd
 
06:44:15.650 --> 06:44:15.660 align:start position:0%
really appreciate it I've been cutting
 
06:44:17.628 --> 06:44:17.638 align:start position:0%
it down as we go
 
06:44:19.868 --> 06:44:19.878 align:start position:0%
um thank you my name is Chris new wrath

um
 
06:44:33.010 --> 06:44:33.020 align:start position:0%
the um
 
06:44:36.170 --> 06:44:36.180 align:start position:0%
oh yeah all right I'll have to hold this
 
06:44:38.330 --> 06:44:38.340 align:start position:0%
I'll have to hold this so I can read it
 
06:44:40.548 --> 06:44:40.558 align:start position:0%
and uh talk into it
 
06:44:43.788 --> 06:44:43.798 align:start position:0%
um the handout that's being given to you
 
06:44:46.548 --> 06:44:46.558 align:start position:0%
is a packet of scientific papers and
 
06:44:48.770 --> 06:44:48.780 align:start position:0%
it's just the first pages and I can
 
06:44:52.128 --> 06:44:52.138 align:start position:0%
supply the whole papers and any other
 
06:44:52.138 --> 06:44:53.510 align:start position:0%
supply the whole papers and any other
papers

06:44:53.510 --> 06:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
papers
 
06:44:56.448 --> 06:44:56.458 align:start position:0%
um for any anybody who's interested on
 
06:44:58.190 --> 06:44:58.200 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
06:45:01.368 --> 06:45:01.378 align:start position:0%
um I'm giving you these because Dental
 
06:45:03.048 --> 06:45:03.058 align:start position:0%
organizations and government Health
 
06:45:05.810 --> 06:45:05.820 align:start position:0%
departments claim there are thousands of
 
06:45:07.970 --> 06:45:07.980 align:start position:0%
studies proving the safety of
 
06:45:10.670 --> 06:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
fluoridation but that is a false
 
06:45:12.890 --> 06:45:12.900 align:start position:0%
statement now it's true that there's
 
06:45:15.948 --> 06:45:15.958 align:start position:0%
been thousands of studies of the adverse
 
06:45:19.670 --> 06:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
effects of fluoride but it is false to
 
06:45:21.890 --> 06:45:21.900 align:start position:0%
say that they that those that collection
 
06:45:25.190 --> 06:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
of uh many studies could conceivably be
 
06:45:28.190 --> 06:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
said to prove
 
06:45:30.948 --> 06:45:30.958 align:start position:0%
uh that see that it proves fluoride is
 
06:45:33.548 --> 06:45:33.558 align:start position:0%
safe the national research Council
 
06:45:37.368 --> 06:45:37.378 align:start position:0%
reviewed over a thousand of them in 2006
 
06:45:40.128 --> 06:45:40.138 align:start position:0%
in the only comprehensive review of the
 
06:45:42.470 --> 06:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
adverse health effects of fluoride ever
 
06:45:45.730 --> 06:45:45.740 align:start position:0%
done and the majority of them found
 
06:45:48.470 --> 06:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
there were adverse health effects and
 
06:45:50.628 --> 06:45:50.638 align:start position:0%
some at exposures experienced by people
 
06:45:52.788 --> 06:45:52.798 align:start position:0%
in the USA
 
06:45:58.548 --> 06:45:58.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:02.390 --> 06:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
um there is uh one specific adverse
 
06:46:04.430 --> 06:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
effect which has been the focus of
 
06:46:06.590 --> 06:46:06.600 align:start position:0%
intense scientific research just in the
 
06:46:08.570 --> 06:46:08.580 align:start position:0%
past five or ten years and that's the

low Arena of IQ of children from early
 
06:46:15.110 --> 06:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
life exposure a systematic review by the
 
06:46:17.570 --> 06:46:17.580 align:start position:0%
national toxicology program has now
 
06:46:19.850 --> 06:46:19.860 align:start position:0%
identified over a hundred of these
 
06:46:22.788 --> 06:46:22.798 align:start position:0%
studies and over 95 percent of them find

lowering of IQ
 
06:46:27.590 --> 06:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
the ntp report on fluoride neurotics
 
06:46:29.628 --> 06:46:29.638 align:start position:0%
toxicity was scheduled to be released
 
06:46:34.190 --> 06:46:34.200 align:start position:0%
released last May but was blocked by
 
06:46:37.670 --> 06:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
political reasons but as Stuart Cooper
 
06:46:42.490 --> 06:46:42.500 align:start position:0%
mentioned it is now a court decision has
 
06:46:46.250 --> 06:46:46.260 align:start position:0%
arranged for it to be released within a
 
06:46:46.260 --> 06:46:47.350 align:start position:0%
arranged for it to be released within a
month

06:46:47.350 --> 06:46:47.360 align:start position:0%
month
 
06:46:50.628 --> 06:46:50.638 align:start position:0%
the dry air is getting to my eyes I'm
 
06:46:52.490 --> 06:46:52.500 align:start position:0%
gonna just
 
06:46:52.500 --> 06:46:54.830 align:start position:0%
gonna just
allergies

06:46:54.830 --> 06:46:54.840 align:start position:0%
allergies
 
06:46:54.840 --> 06:46:58.250 align:start position:0%
allergies
um

06:46:58.250 --> 06:46:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:00.070 --> 06:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
so the New Hampshire
 
06:47:02.628 --> 06:47:02.638 align:start position:0%
legislature will have a chance to see
 
06:47:05.590 --> 06:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
for themselves what the ntp has found
 
06:47:08.150 --> 06:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
unfiltered by those who try to say this
 
06:47:10.190 --> 06:47:10.200 align:start position:0%
five-year long systematic review is
 
06:47:12.948 --> 06:47:12.958 align:start position:0%
invalid and can be ignored
 
06:47:14.930 --> 06:47:14.940 align:start position:0%
several of the most recent and strongest
 
06:47:14.940 --> 06:47:16.010 align:start position:0%
several of the most recent and strongest
studies

06:47:16.010 --> 06:47:16.020 align:start position:0%
studies
 
06:47:18.410 --> 06:47:18.420 align:start position:0%
have been funded with NIH grants and
 
06:47:20.810 --> 06:47:20.820 align:start position:0%
have been conducted by the preeminent
 
06:47:23.150 --> 06:47:23.160 align:start position:0%
environmental epidemiologists and
 
06:47:26.390 --> 06:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
specialists in neurotoxicity these
 
06:47:29.150 --> 06:47:29.160 align:start position:0%
experts include scientists who've
 
06:47:31.390 --> 06:47:31.400 align:start position:0%
conducted studies on lead Mercury
 
06:47:33.788 --> 06:47:33.798 align:start position:0%
perfluorinated compounds
 
06:47:36.730 --> 06:47:36.740 align:start position:0%
and their work has helped
 
06:47:41.150 --> 06:47:41.160 align:start position:0%
the CDC and the EPA set regulations on
 
06:47:43.368 --> 06:47:43.378 align:start position:0%
lead and Mercury
 
06:47:43.378 --> 06:47:44.150 align:start position:0%
lead and Mercury
um

06:47:44.150 --> 06:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:47:45.948 --> 06:47:45.958 align:start position:0%
they have turned their attention to
 
06:47:48.830 --> 06:47:48.840 align:start position:0%
fluoride and have found fluoride is also
 
06:47:53.770 --> 06:47:53.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:56.330 --> 06:47:56.340 align:start position:0%
but don't take my word for it the bill
 
06:47:58.910 --> 06:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
before you would establish a study
 
06:48:01.548 --> 06:48:01.558 align:start position:0%
committee where you can look at the
 
06:48:06.530 --> 06:48:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:06.540 --> 06:48:12.548 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:48:12.548 --> 06:48:12.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:17.810 --> 06:48:17.820 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to quote from uh again this
 
06:48:19.788 --> 06:48:19.798 align:start position:0%
is this is not don't have to take it
 
06:48:24.530 --> 06:48:24.540 align:start position:0%
from me uh the the chief editors of Jama
 
06:48:25.670 --> 06:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
the Journal of the American Medical
 
06:48:28.610 --> 06:48:28.620 align:start position:0%
Association I had a podcast where they
 
06:48:31.968 --> 06:48:31.978 align:start position:0%
discussed that paper and the idea and
 
06:48:33.890 --> 06:48:33.900 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to do a few quotes from
 
06:48:33.900 --> 06:48:34.868 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to do a few quotes from
them

06:48:34.868 --> 06:48:34.878 align:start position:0%
them
 
06:48:37.788 --> 06:48:37.798 align:start position:0%
Dr Rivera the paper is about fluoride
 
06:48:39.590 --> 06:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
and maternal fluoride exposure during
 
06:48:41.990 --> 06:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
pregnancy and its effects upon IQ scores
 
06:48:45.288 --> 06:48:45.298 align:start position:0%
of children which in itself is like a
 
06:48:47.208 --> 06:48:47.218 align:start position:0%
shocking title because I had never known
 
06:48:48.948 --> 06:48:48.958 align:start position:0%
that there was even any concern that
 
06:48:50.930 --> 06:48:50.940 align:start position:0%
maternal fluoride use might affect
 
06:48:54.650 --> 06:48:54.660 align:start position:0%
children's IQ Dr christakis yeah please
 
06:48:57.110 --> 06:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
wrap up I will the traditional teaching
 
06:48:58.788 --> 06:48:58.798 align:start position:0%
when I was going on was that fluoride
 
06:49:01.128 --> 06:49:01.138 align:start position:0%
was completely safe so when I first saw
 
06:49:03.410 --> 06:49:03.420 align:start position:0%
this title my initial inclination was
 
06:49:05.930 --> 06:49:05.940 align:start position:0%
what the hell
 
06:49:05.940 --> 06:49:07.070 align:start position:0%
what the hell
um

06:49:07.070 --> 06:49:07.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:49:09.230 --> 06:49:09.240 align:start position:0%
a one milligram per liter increase in
 
06:49:11.390 --> 06:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
maternal urinary fluoride was associated
 
06:49:13.910 --> 06:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
with a five-point lower skin and I'm
 
06:49:16.368 --> 06:49:16.378 align:start position:0%
going to add my concern to yours we have
 
06:49:18.708 --> 06:49:18.718 align:start position:0%
limited strictly other people one minute
 
06:49:21.288 --> 06:49:21.298 align:start position:0%
one minute sorry we were strictly
 
06:49:23.208 --> 06:49:23.218 align:start position:0%
limited other people and you have gone
 
06:49:26.750 --> 06:49:26.760 align:start position:0%
over time and it's not fair okay to them
 
06:49:29.628 --> 06:49:29.638 align:start position:0%
a final final sentence
 
06:49:29.638 --> 06:49:30.590 align:start position:0%
a final final sentence
um

06:49:30.590 --> 06:49:30.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:49:32.810 --> 06:49:32.820 align:start position:0%
so if mothers now come into their
 
06:49:34.310 --> 06:49:34.320 align:start position:0%
doctor's offices and ask the
 
06:49:35.868 --> 06:49:35.878 align:start position:0%
pediatrician what to do what are you
 
06:49:38.510 --> 06:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
going to say I think I would advise them
 
06:49:40.628 --> 06:49:40.638 align:start position:0%
to drink bottled water or filtered water
 
06:49:43.670 --> 06:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
okay thank you sir those are the editors
 
06:49:47.270 --> 06:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
of Jama Pediatrics and Tama online thank
 
06:49:48.530 --> 06:49:48.540 align:start position:0%
you so much I'd be happy to answer any
 
06:49:48.540 --> 06:49:50.930 align:start position:0%
you so much I'd be happy to answer any
questions

06:49:50.930 --> 06:49:50.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:53.390 --> 06:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
I'm saying no question thank you thank
 
06:49:53.400 --> 06:49:54.530 align:start position:0%
I'm saying no question thank you thank
you

06:49:54.530 --> 06:49:54.540 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:49:57.650 --> 06:49:57.660 align:start position:0%
also signed up to testify and I don't
 
06:49:59.448 --> 06:49:59.458 align:start position:0%
think I can pronounce this last name so
 
06:50:01.548 --> 06:50:01.558 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to try Dr Christine from
 
06:50:05.030 --> 06:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:05.040 --> 06:50:06.350 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:50:06.350 --> 06:50:06.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:50:08.750 --> 06:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
you know who you are it's my husband's
 
06:50:11.330 --> 06:50:11.340 align:start position:0%
last name I took it I apologize for not
 
06:50:13.850 --> 06:50:13.860 align:start position:0%
being able to read it but hi I'm Chris
 
06:50:15.890 --> 06:50:15.900 align:start position:0%
Blackwelder I'm a general dentist in
 
06:50:15.900 --> 06:50:17.030 align:start position:0%
Blackwelder I'm a general dentist in
Tilton

06:50:17.030 --> 06:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
Tilton
 
06:50:19.368 --> 06:50:19.378 align:start position:0%
um I'm a general dentist but I only see
 
06:50:22.670 --> 06:50:22.680 align:start position:0%
children in the elderly the the bookends
 
06:50:23.930 --> 06:50:23.940 align:start position:0%
um I don't want to be redundant again
 
06:50:25.910 --> 06:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
you have three minutes yes of course I
 
06:50:27.170 --> 06:50:27.180 align:start position:0%
don't want to be redundant of my
 
06:50:28.730 --> 06:50:28.740 align:start position:0%
colleagues but I do want to highlight a
 
06:50:28.740 --> 06:50:29.570 align:start position:0%
colleagues but I do want to highlight a
couple

06:50:29.570 --> 06:50:29.580 align:start position:0%
couple
 
06:50:31.190 --> 06:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
um questions that I've heard so far
 
06:50:32.868 --> 06:50:32.878 align:start position:0%
today so I want to take a moment and
 
06:50:35.090 --> 06:50:35.100 align:start position:0%
talk about systemic versus topical
 
06:50:38.330 --> 06:50:38.340 align:start position:0%
fluoride so systemic fluoride for the
 
06:50:39.890 --> 06:50:39.900 align:start position:0%
children is what we need is a building
 
06:50:42.048 --> 06:50:42.058 align:start position:0%
block to create that stronger enamel
 
06:50:44.868 --> 06:50:44.878 align:start position:0%
Matrix topical fluoride is what you and
 
06:50:47.448 --> 06:50:47.458 align:start position:0%
I use on our teeth to prevent Decay day
 
06:50:50.090 --> 06:50:50.100 align:start position:0%
to day but our our Matrix is already
 
06:50:52.368 --> 06:50:52.378 align:start position:0%
formed so the topical fluoride from a
 
06:50:54.830 --> 06:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
Fluoride Varnish or a dentrifice would
 
06:50:57.110 --> 06:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
come topically of course and then the
 
06:51:00.110 --> 06:51:00.120 align:start position:0%
systemic the systemic fluoride is
 
06:51:01.788 --> 06:51:01.798 align:start position:0%
typically in community water as we've
 
06:51:03.288 --> 06:51:03.298 align:start position:0%
heard already today we have very few
 
06:51:06.288 --> 06:51:06.298 align:start position:0%
communities in our in our state I
 
06:51:08.448 --> 06:51:08.458 align:start position:0%
practice in The Lakes Region and when I
 
06:51:10.788 --> 06:51:10.798 align:start position:0%
see a child from Laconia I take a little
 
06:51:12.288 --> 06:51:12.298 align:start position:0%
sigh of relief because I know that
 
06:51:14.868 --> 06:51:14.878 align:start position:0%
child's got like one check in the in the
 
06:51:16.250 --> 06:51:16.260 align:start position:0%
Pro box
 
06:51:16.260 --> 06:51:17.030 align:start position:0%
Pro box
um

06:51:17.030 --> 06:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:51:19.788 --> 06:51:19.798 align:start position:0%
so I wanted to highlight that we should
 
06:51:21.590 --> 06:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
know that Dental caries is the most
 
06:51:23.810 --> 06:51:23.820 align:start position:0%
common chronic disease of childhood and
 
06:51:25.430 --> 06:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
it's the number one cause of missing
 
06:51:27.770 --> 06:51:27.780 align:start position:0%
school hours I think that's significant
 
06:51:30.530 --> 06:51:30.540 align:start position:0%
to highlight and I say this to my
 
06:51:32.810 --> 06:51:32.820 align:start position:0%
patients you know I'm a mother as well I
 
06:51:35.090 --> 06:51:35.100 align:start position:0%
I live on well water and I had to
 
06:51:36.948 --> 06:51:36.958 align:start position:0%
examine what the Baseline of our well
 
06:51:39.468 --> 06:51:39.478 align:start position:0%
water is we have to be prescriptive in
 
06:51:41.830 --> 06:51:41.840 align:start position:0%
how we use this
 
06:51:44.990 --> 06:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
this mineral so we have to look at what
 
06:51:46.968 --> 06:51:46.978 align:start position:0%
the Baseline is on a well water or a
 
06:51:48.850 --> 06:51:48.860 align:start position:0%
community and prescribe accordingly
 
06:51:51.708 --> 06:51:51.718 align:start position:0%
vitamin C you can overdose on and get
 
06:51:54.650 --> 06:51:54.660 align:start position:0%
severe diarrhea and vomiting so too much
 
06:51:57.770 --> 06:51:57.780 align:start position:0%
of a good thing can be a bad thing
 
06:51:57.780 --> 06:52:00.110 align:start position:0%
of a good thing can be a bad thing
um

06:52:00.110 --> 06:52:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:00.120 --> 06:52:04.090 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

06:52:04.090 --> 06:52:04.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:07.850 --> 06:52:07.860 align:start position:0%
again I I'm not fearful of a study I I
 
06:52:10.910 --> 06:52:10.920 align:start position:0%
welcome all information but as Dr Rosado
 
06:52:12.468 --> 06:52:12.478 align:start position:0%
said I think we just need to be
 
06:52:15.530 --> 06:52:15.540 align:start position:0%
conscientious of of the source
 
06:52:17.510 --> 06:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
um making sure that you know it's a
 
06:52:19.070 --> 06:52:19.080 align:start position:0%
double-blind study and we'll leave you
 
06:52:22.070 --> 06:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
today with a robust meta-analysis of of
 
06:52:24.650 --> 06:52:24.660 align:start position:0%
current I saw on our bibliography today
 
06:52:29.448 --> 06:52:29.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:31.968 --> 06:52:31.978 align:start position:0%
okay thank you questions
 
06:52:33.948 --> 06:52:33.958 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman
 
06:52:35.570 --> 06:52:35.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for taking my
 
06:52:35.580 --> 06:52:36.708 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for taking my
question

06:52:36.708 --> 06:52:36.718 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:52:38.570 --> 06:52:38.580 align:start position:0%
um and thank you for taking my I mean
 
06:52:41.150 --> 06:52:41.160 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you uh so my
 
06:52:42.948 --> 06:52:42.958 align:start position:0%
question is related to diet because all
 
06:52:44.810 --> 06:52:44.820 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing a lot about you need
 
06:52:44.820 --> 06:52:46.128 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing a lot about you need
fluoride

06:52:46.128 --> 06:52:46.138 align:start position:0%
fluoride
 
06:52:49.310 --> 06:52:49.320 align:start position:0%
um for infants and small children who
 
06:52:52.310 --> 06:52:52.320 align:start position:0%
can't yet spit out topical fluoride but
 
06:52:54.410 --> 06:52:54.420 align:start position:0%
haven't heard much about diet and I know
 
06:52:56.330 --> 06:52:56.340 align:start position:0%
the Western A price foundation has done
 
06:52:58.850 --> 06:52:58.860 align:start position:0%
extensive research on
 
06:53:01.250 --> 06:53:01.260 align:start position:0%
um different uh populations around the
 
06:53:04.010 --> 06:53:04.020 align:start position:0%
world and their dental health and how
 
06:53:06.288 --> 06:53:06.298 align:start position:0%
their diets related to that and what was
 
06:53:08.990 --> 06:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
in common and they found that vitamin
 
06:53:13.548 --> 06:53:13.558 align:start position:0%
sufficient vitamin D organ Meats animal
 
06:53:16.190 --> 06:53:16.200 align:start position:0%
fats and proteins were vital to
 
06:53:16.200 --> 06:53:17.448 align:start position:0%
fats and proteins were vital to
establish

06:53:17.448 --> 06:53:17.458 align:start position:0%
establish
 
06:53:19.850 --> 06:53:19.860 align:start position:0%
um you know good oral health from the
 
06:53:19.860 --> 06:53:21.170 align:start position:0%
um you know good oral health from the
beginning

06:53:21.170 --> 06:53:21.180 align:start position:0%
beginning
 
06:53:24.910 --> 06:53:24.920 align:start position:0%
um and I I know that sugar is especially
 
06:53:27.770 --> 06:53:27.780 align:start position:0%
detrimental to dental health and as well
 
06:53:29.570 --> 06:53:29.580 align:start position:0%
as an imbalance in the microbiome of the
 
06:53:33.890 --> 06:53:33.900 align:start position:0%
mouth so I'm just wondering how much of
 
06:53:35.990 --> 06:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
you know what you're seeing where you
 
06:53:37.548 --> 06:53:37.558 align:start position:0%
see tooth decay in children how much of
 
06:53:39.530 --> 06:53:39.540 align:start position:0%
that is related to fluoride and how much
 
06:53:42.410 --> 06:53:42.420 align:start position:0%
is really diet related and how can you
 
06:53:44.628 --> 06:53:44.638 align:start position:0%
differentiate between that this is my
 
06:53:46.128 --> 06:53:46.138 align:start position:0%
love language I'm getting all excited
 
06:53:49.190 --> 06:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
okay so we need to start with a a strong
 
06:53:52.128 --> 06:53:52.138 align:start position:0%
foundation so you have a tooth and if
 
06:53:53.690 --> 06:53:53.700 align:start position:0%
it's been exposed to fluoride it has
 
06:53:56.090 --> 06:53:56.100 align:start position:0%
this strong enamel Matrix but if it's
 
06:53:58.190 --> 06:53:58.200 align:start position:0%
not then it's it can be more compromised
 
06:54:00.170 --> 06:54:00.180 align:start position:0%
so you bring in our diet our Western
 
06:54:02.390 --> 06:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
diet which is totally carbohydrate based
 
06:54:04.128 --> 06:54:04.138 align:start position:0%
we are getting more cavities these days
 
06:54:06.288 --> 06:54:06.298 align:start position:0%
not from sugar not from soda from
 
06:54:09.410 --> 06:54:09.420 align:start position:0%
goldfish any fermentable carbohydrate a
 
06:54:11.990 --> 06:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
potato chip a Wheat Thin it can be a
 
06:54:13.730 --> 06:54:13.740 align:start position:0%
whole grain and that's still feeding the
 
06:54:16.128 --> 06:54:16.138 align:start position:0%
bad bacteria and to your point right we
 
06:54:17.690 --> 06:54:17.700 align:start position:0%
all have ten thousand I'm getting all
 
06:54:19.610 --> 06:54:19.620 align:start position:0%
excited 10 000 different kinds of
 
06:54:20.930 --> 06:54:20.940 align:start position:0%
bacteria in our mouth and we have good
 
06:54:23.030 --> 06:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
bacteria and we have bad bacteria so now
 
06:54:24.708 --> 06:54:24.718 align:start position:0%
the science knows that we are feeding
 
06:54:27.170 --> 06:54:27.180 align:start position:0%
those bad bacteria all of those
 
06:54:29.390 --> 06:54:29.400 align:start position:0%
fermentable carbohydrate and then not
 
06:54:32.868 --> 06:54:32.878 align:start position:0%
adequately removing them at night so I
 
06:54:35.270 --> 06:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
had one other thought oh we can't we do
 
06:54:37.910 --> 06:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
have science to combat those or I'm
 
06:54:39.350 --> 06:54:39.360 align:start position:0%
sorry to combat the bad bacteria and
 
06:54:40.730 --> 06:54:40.740 align:start position:0%
promote the good bacteria through like
 
06:54:43.128 --> 06:54:43.138 align:start position:0%
Xylitol and more night
 
06:54:46.190 --> 06:54:46.200 align:start position:0%
um like basic type foods so you're
 
06:54:48.110 --> 06:54:48.120 align:start position:0%
getting more than you need but eggs nuts
 
06:54:49.250 --> 06:54:49.260 align:start position:0%
and cheeses and all those things that
 
06:54:51.230 --> 06:54:51.240 align:start position:0%
help promote those Basic Foods will
 
06:54:53.390 --> 06:54:53.400 align:start position:0%
certainly help so it is so complicated
 
06:54:56.750 --> 06:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's the the structure it's the
 
06:54:59.868 --> 06:54:59.878 align:start position:0%
diet and it's removing the Schmutz
 
06:55:03.230 --> 06:55:03.240 align:start position:0%
does that end to your question more than
 
06:55:06.410 --> 06:55:06.420 align:start position:0%
representative Palazzo thank you Mr Chen
 
06:55:08.690 --> 06:55:08.700 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so
 
06:55:11.690 --> 06:55:11.700 align:start position:0%
first I want to understand if a kid
 
06:55:15.530 --> 06:55:15.540 align:start position:0%
plays with uh to play two space to
 
06:55:18.288 --> 06:55:18.298 align:start position:0%
explore early then accidentally consumes
 
06:55:22.490 --> 06:55:22.500 align:start position:0%
it does it becomes systemic fluoride and
 
06:55:25.610 --> 06:55:25.620 align:start position:0%
also like what age do you want this
 
06:55:28.090 --> 06:55:28.100 align:start position:0%
systemic fluoride
 
06:55:31.190 --> 06:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
for adolescent
 
06:55:33.708 --> 06:55:33.718 align:start position:0%
um obviously you say it needs to form
 
06:55:37.368 --> 06:55:37.378 align:start position:0%
this tooth tissue but before they have
 
06:55:42.170 --> 06:55:42.180 align:start position:0%
cheese or when the fetuses do they still
 
06:55:45.830 --> 06:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
need it or can we cut off some
 
06:55:50.448 --> 06:55:50.458 align:start position:0%
exemptions for young ages before two
 
06:55:53.448 --> 06:55:53.458 align:start position:0%
spin from okay so your first question
 
06:55:55.430 --> 06:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
was about ingesting a tube or toothpaste
 
06:55:56.930 --> 06:55:56.940 align:start position:0%
and yes too much of a good thing is a
 
06:55:59.810 --> 06:55:59.820 align:start position:0%
bad thing not good would want them to
 
06:56:02.448 --> 06:56:02.458 align:start position:0%
not ingest the tube of toothpaste and to
 
06:56:03.770 --> 06:56:03.780 align:start position:0%
your second Point
 
06:56:03.780 --> 06:56:04.430 align:start position:0%
your second Point
um

06:56:04.430 --> 06:56:04.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:56:07.610 --> 06:56:07.620 align:start position:0%
so we I advocate for my patients to be
 
06:56:10.070 --> 06:56:10.080 align:start position:0%
on systemic fluoride until about 16 and
 
06:56:12.650 --> 06:56:12.660 align:start position:0%
then they're fully mineralized and for
 
06:56:14.628 --> 06:56:14.638 align:start position:0%
my pregnant patients who are on well
 
06:56:16.850 --> 06:56:16.860 align:start position:0%
water or in a community with no fluoride
 
06:56:18.350 --> 06:56:18.360 align:start position:0%
in their water I recommend that they
 
06:56:20.810 --> 06:56:20.820 align:start position:0%
then drink the nursery water it's a it's
 
06:56:22.788 --> 06:56:22.798 align:start position:0%
a jug of water that has the perfect
 
06:56:25.310 --> 06:56:25.320 align:start position:0%
amount of fluoride added back to it was
 
06:56:27.468 --> 06:56:27.478 align:start position:0%
there another
 
06:56:30.048 --> 06:56:30.058 align:start position:0%
concept representative Nagel did you
 
06:56:32.030 --> 06:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
have your hand up
 
06:56:33.770 --> 06:56:33.780 align:start position:0%
answered my question
 
06:56:36.368 --> 06:56:36.378 align:start position:0%
um I I really struggle with
 
06:56:39.830 --> 06:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
epidemiologic studies on complex social
 
06:56:42.850 --> 06:56:42.860 align:start position:0%
um physical things
 
06:56:45.048 --> 06:56:45.058 align:start position:0%
Association doesn't necessarily mean
 
06:56:45.058 --> 06:56:46.150 align:start position:0%
Association doesn't necessarily mean
cause

06:56:46.150 --> 06:56:46.160 align:start position:0%
cause
 
06:56:48.350 --> 06:56:48.360 align:start position:0%
with that said
 
06:56:51.230 --> 06:56:51.240 align:start position:0%
um we have had a number of papers that
 
06:56:53.830 --> 06:56:53.840 align:start position:0%
implied that there is an association of
 
06:56:56.570 --> 06:56:56.580 align:start position:0%
neonatal problems with fluoride and
 
06:56:58.490 --> 06:56:58.500 align:start position:0%
water and I'm curious what you recommend
 
06:57:01.070 --> 06:57:01.080 align:start position:0%
to your patients which I think
 
06:57:05.208 --> 06:57:05.218 align:start position:0%
yeah I I supplement my children not your
 
06:57:08.510 --> 06:57:08.520 align:start position:0%
children but a pregnant woman oh so same
 
06:57:11.930 --> 06:57:11.940 align:start position:0%
um I I have her uh drink drinking the
 
06:57:13.730 --> 06:57:13.740 align:start position:0%
nursery water so that has the added
 
06:57:16.670 --> 06:57:16.680 align:start position:0%
fluoride in it yes I do
 
06:57:19.548 --> 06:57:19.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:21.110 --> 06:57:21.120 align:start position:0%
representative King
 
06:57:23.030 --> 06:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman McDonald I feel like
 
06:57:25.070 --> 06:57:25.080 align:start position:0%
the committee that we're trying to
 
06:57:27.048 --> 06:57:27.058 align:start position:0%
establish is almost happening right now
 
06:57:29.930 --> 06:57:29.940 align:start position:0%
as we speak I I failed to I failed to
 
06:57:31.670 --> 06:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
catch whether or not you were in favor
 
06:57:34.250 --> 06:57:34.260 align:start position:0%
or against having this committee sorry I
 
06:57:36.590 --> 06:57:36.600 align:start position:0%
I'm against I just think that you're
 
06:57:38.270 --> 06:57:38.280 align:start position:0%
you're wise enough to be able to process
 
06:57:39.948 --> 06:57:39.958 align:start position:0%
the information we're leaving with you
 
06:57:44.690 --> 06:57:44.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:46.548 --> 06:57:46.558 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
06:57:48.890 --> 06:57:48.900 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much I
 
06:57:51.590 --> 06:57:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:53.330 --> 06:57:53.340 align:start position:0%
and the final person signed up to
 
06:57:56.868 --> 06:57:56.878 align:start position:0%
testify today is Michael Abra back from
 
06:58:03.830 --> 06:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:05.930 --> 06:58:05.940 align:start position:0%
did I did I butcher it
 
06:58:05.940 --> 06:58:07.490 align:start position:0%
did I did I butcher it
okay

06:58:07.490 --> 06:58:07.500 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:58:13.310 --> 06:58:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:18.230 --> 06:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:19.670 --> 06:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and the three
 
06:58:21.708 --> 06:58:21.718 align:start position:0%
years to the members and uh I do have a
 
06:58:23.330 --> 06:58:23.340 align:start position:0%
missive here but uh I'm just going to
 
06:58:25.250 --> 06:58:25.260 align:start position:0%
send this to you separately
 
06:58:27.350 --> 06:58:27.360 align:start position:0%
um as part of the collection of
 
06:58:30.230 --> 06:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
legitimate studies uh and comments on
 
06:58:32.030 --> 06:58:32.040 align:start position:0%
such studies that we've heard previously
 
06:58:36.230 --> 06:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
about the ntp and uh other factors that
 
06:58:38.690 --> 06:58:38.700 align:start position:0%
were disregarded uh when discussing
 
06:58:40.690 --> 06:58:40.700 align:start position:0%
fluorides and it's so-called
 
06:58:43.368 --> 06:58:43.378 align:start position:0%
neurotoxicity uh when it's added to the
 
06:58:45.948 --> 06:58:45.958 align:start position:0%
water my name is Michael Auerbach I'm
 
06:58:47.208 --> 06:58:47.218 align:start position:0%
the executive director of the New
 
06:58:49.368 --> 06:58:49.378 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Dental Society on behalf of
 
06:58:51.770 --> 06:58:51.780 align:start position:0%
our nearly 1100 member dentists some of
 
06:58:54.430 --> 06:58:54.440 align:start position:0%
whom you've just heard just today
 
06:58:57.410 --> 06:58:57.420 align:start position:0%
hygienists assistance and office staff I
 
06:58:59.150 --> 06:58:59.160 align:start position:0%
am speaking to you today in opposition
 
06:59:03.770 --> 06:59:03.780 align:start position:0%
to HB 217. we've been here before uh in
 
06:59:05.810 --> 06:59:05.820 align:start position:0%
the last uh well I've been here for
 
06:59:07.910 --> 06:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
eight years I've testified against
 
06:59:09.708 --> 06:59:09.718 align:start position:0%
efforts to ban Community water
 
06:59:12.468 --> 06:59:12.478 align:start position:0%
fluoridation based on flawed studies
 
06:59:15.350 --> 06:59:15.360 align:start position:0%
four times during those eight years
 
06:59:17.208 --> 06:59:17.218 align:start position:0%
and each time the Health and Human
 
06:59:19.610 --> 06:59:19.620 align:start position:0%
Services committee has chimed in with
 
06:59:22.010 --> 06:59:22.020 align:start position:0%
questions just like you've had
 
06:59:24.788 --> 06:59:24.798 align:start position:0%
I will not go into the motivations
 
06:59:28.128 --> 06:59:28.138 align:start position:0%
beyond the fact that the effort is to
 
06:59:31.430 --> 06:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
create some sort of scientific uh
 
06:59:33.048 --> 06:59:33.058 align:start position:0%
Foundation or perceived scientific
 
06:59:35.868 --> 06:59:35.878 align:start position:0%
foundation for Banning fluoride
 
06:59:38.510 --> 06:59:38.520 align:start position:0%
when every legitimate scientific source
 
06:59:40.430 --> 06:59:40.440 align:start position:0%
that we've seen including those that
 
06:59:42.288 --> 06:59:42.298 align:start position:0%
you've just seen that were in the last
 
06:59:45.170 --> 06:59:45.180 align:start position:0%
month would tell you otherwise
 
06:59:47.868 --> 06:59:47.878 align:start position:0%
but the question that was asked several
 
06:59:52.250 --> 06:59:52.260 align:start position:0%
times here was why are we afraid of a
 
06:59:54.890 --> 06:59:54.900 align:start position:0%
committee why are we forming a committee
 
06:59:56.990 --> 06:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
it's because you don't need a committee
 
06:59:59.750 --> 06:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
everybody here at this table everybody
 
07:00:01.430 --> 07:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
here behind me
 
07:00:03.350 --> 07:00:03.360 align:start position:0%
has already the answers at their
 
07:00:06.948 --> 07:00:06.958 align:start position:0%
disposal ask a dentist they have no
 
07:00:09.590 --> 07:00:09.600 align:start position:0%
personal gain financial gain from giving
 
07:00:12.288 --> 07:00:12.298 align:start position:0%
you the best health information possible
 
07:00:15.350 --> 07:00:15.360 align:start position:0%
they read the studies they hear the the
 
07:00:15.360 --> 07:00:16.670 align:start position:0%
they read the studies they hear the the
information

07:00:16.670 --> 07:00:16.680 align:start position:0%
information
 
07:00:19.010 --> 07:00:19.020 align:start position:0%
they attend CES Community commit
 
07:00:21.288 --> 07:00:21.298 align:start position:0%
continuing education on a monthly basis
 
07:00:23.208 --> 07:00:23.218 align:start position:0%
and are required to do so for their
 
07:00:25.368 --> 07:00:25.378 align:start position:0%
licensure they have all the information
 
07:00:26.930 --> 07:00:26.940 align:start position:0%
that you need
 
07:00:29.750 --> 07:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
so rather than waste your time
 
07:00:32.570 --> 07:00:32.580 align:start position:0%
and waste your resources everybody here
 
07:00:34.368 --> 07:00:34.378 align:start position:0%
I encourage you
 
07:00:35.990 --> 07:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
talk to these four
 
07:00:38.150 --> 07:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
that are behind me talk to your own
 
07:00:40.070 --> 07:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
dentist because they're going to give
 
07:00:42.230 --> 07:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
you the information you need I ask that
 
07:00:44.448 --> 07:00:44.458 align:start position:0%
you vote this bill in expedient to
 
07:00:46.670 --> 07:00:46.680 align:start position:0%
legislate and I ask I'm happy to answer
 
07:00:48.410 --> 07:00:48.420 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
07:00:52.010 --> 07:00:52.020 align:start position:0%
thank you questions from the committee
 
07:00:54.110 --> 07:00:54.120 align:start position:0%
seeing no questions thank you sir thank
 
07:00:54.120 --> 07:00:56.628 align:start position:0%
seeing no questions thank you sir thank
you

07:00:56.628 --> 07:00:56.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:00.288 --> 07:01:00.298 align:start position:0%
okay I have no other uh individual side
 
07:01:02.448 --> 07:01:02.458 align:start position:0%
I have no one else signed up to speak
 
07:01:05.270 --> 07:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
today does anyone else wish to speak on
 
07:01:08.390 --> 07:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
House Bill 217 if not I am going to
 
07:01:09.830 --> 07:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing on House Bill
 
07:01:13.070 --> 07:01:13.080 align:start position:0%
217 and open the Committee hearing on
 
07:01:15.770 --> 07:01:15.780 align:start position:0%
House Bill 342 and this time I'll
 
07:01:17.150 --> 07:01:17.160 align:start position:0%
recognize the prime sponsor

okay

07:02:02.150 --> 07:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:04.548 --> 07:02:04.558 align:start position:0%
okay good afternoon good afternoon chair
 
07:02:06.590 --> 07:02:06.600 align:start position:0%
McDonald members of the committee for
 
07:02:08.810 --> 07:02:08.820 align:start position:0%
the record I'm Nancy Murphy representing
 
07:02:11.868 --> 07:02:11.878 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro 12 the town of Merrimack I'm
 
07:02:15.288 --> 07:02:15.298 align:start position:0%
here as Prime sponsor of HB 342 relative
 
07:02:17.570 --> 07:02:17.580 align:start position:0%
to lead testing in children
 
07:02:19.730 --> 07:02:19.740 align:start position:0%
in the interest of time his expertise
 
07:02:22.610 --> 07:02:22.620 align:start position:0%
and his work on this uh prior I'd ask
 
07:02:26.930 --> 07:02:26.940 align:start position:0%
that I honorable Dr Jerry knurk former
 
07:02:29.208 --> 07:02:29.218 align:start position:0%
HHS Community Committee Member be
 
07:02:31.368 --> 07:02:31.378 align:start position:0%
afforded the opportunity to use my time
 
07:02:34.548 --> 07:02:34.558 align:start position:0%
to introduce it thank you Mr chair thank
 
07:02:36.948 --> 07:02:36.958 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
07:02:36.958 --> 07:02:55.548 align:start position:0%
you representative
foreign

07:02:55.548 --> 07:02:55.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:57.590 --> 07:02:57.600 align:start position:0%
good afternoon yes good afternoon thank
 
07:03:00.170 --> 07:03:00.180 align:start position:0%
you very much so yes this uh this bill
 
07:03:01.910 --> 07:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
is identical to the amended version of
 
07:03:07.128 --> 07:03:07.138 align:start position:0%
HB 1642 from 2022 uh which this
 
07:03:09.230 --> 07:03:09.240 align:start position:0%
committee recommended otpa with a vote
 
07:03:11.750 --> 07:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
of 20 to 1 and I managed that bill
 
07:03:13.548 --> 07:03:13.558 align:start position:0%
through the house and was asked by the
 
07:03:15.708 --> 07:03:15.718 align:start position:0%
sponsor to introduce this bill
 
07:03:17.868 --> 07:03:17.878 align:start position:0%
this bill establishes a blood level
 
07:03:20.690 --> 07:03:20.700 align:start position:0%
testing lead level sorry testing
 
07:03:22.310 --> 07:03:22.320 align:start position:0%
requirement for children entering day
 
07:03:25.070 --> 07:03:25.080 align:start position:0%
care and public schools requiring the
 
07:03:26.750 --> 07:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
completed test to be documented on
 
07:03:29.448 --> 07:03:29.458 align:start position:0%
Children's Health assessment forms the
 
07:03:31.010 --> 07:03:31.020 align:start position:0%
goal is to improve compliance with lead
 
07:03:33.770 --> 07:03:33.780 align:start position:0%
testing by serving as a reminder at a
 
07:03:36.530 --> 07:03:36.540 align:start position:0%
common point of contact with children
 
07:03:38.810 --> 07:03:38.820 align:start position:0%
now important to understand there is no
 
07:03:41.810 --> 07:03:41.820 align:start position:0%
safe level for lead lead is a neurotoxin
 
07:03:43.368 --> 07:03:43.378 align:start position:0%
which is particularly damaging to the
 
07:03:45.288 --> 07:03:45.298 align:start position:0%
brain during development this one is not
 
07:03:46.910 --> 07:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
controversial the previous we had a lot
 
07:03:48.770 --> 07:03:48.780 align:start position:0%
of controversy that has been well
 
07:03:50.530 --> 07:03:50.540 align:start position:0%
accepted to be a problem
 
07:03:52.788 --> 07:03:52.798 align:start position:0%
so it's really very dangerous to young
 
07:03:53.868 --> 07:03:53.878 align:start position:0%
children because their brain is
 
07:03:56.448 --> 07:03:56.458 align:start position:0%
developing even low levels of lead in
 
07:03:58.368 --> 07:03:58.378 align:start position:0%
the blood will negatively affect a
 
07:04:00.590 --> 07:04:00.600 align:start position:0%
child's ability to learn and behave and
 
07:04:02.930 --> 07:04:02.940 align:start position:0%
these effects may be permanent it's
 
07:04:04.670 --> 07:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
estimated that about one in five cases
 
07:04:06.650 --> 07:04:06.660 align:start position:0%
of attention deficit disorder are due to
 
07:04:09.048 --> 07:04:09.058 align:start position:0%
lead exposure but if you catch it early
 
07:04:10.788 --> 07:04:10.798 align:start position:0%
there are things parents can do to
 
07:04:12.890 --> 07:04:12.900 align:start position:0%
prevent further exposure and reduce
 
07:04:14.990 --> 07:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
damage to their child's health in
 
07:04:17.208 --> 07:04:17.218 align:start position:0%
addition there is a multiplier effect as
 
07:04:18.708 --> 07:04:18.718 align:start position:0%
the interventions you do to reduce the
 
07:04:20.750 --> 07:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
lead exposure for that child will
 
07:04:22.190 --> 07:04:22.200 align:start position:0%
protect the health of that child's
 
07:04:24.770 --> 07:04:24.780 align:start position:0%
siblings in the home who are also at
 
07:04:24.780 --> 07:04:25.850 align:start position:0%
siblings in the home who are also at
risk

07:04:25.850 --> 07:04:25.860 align:start position:0%
risk
 
07:04:27.948 --> 07:04:27.958 align:start position:0%
there are many sources of lead with the
 
07:04:29.390 --> 07:04:29.400 align:start position:0%
most common being the presence of lead
 
07:04:31.010 --> 07:04:31.020 align:start position:0%
paint in the home
 
07:04:33.070 --> 07:04:33.080 align:start position:0%
lead was not prohibited in paint until
 
07:04:35.930 --> 07:04:35.940 align:start position:0%
1978 but New Hampshire has the oldest
 
07:04:37.850 --> 07:04:37.860 align:start position:0%
housing stock in the nation with 63
 
07:04:40.490 --> 07:04:40.500 align:start position:0%
percent of the stock built prior to 78
 
07:04:42.590 --> 07:04:42.600 align:start position:0%
and therefore at risk the most common
 
07:04:44.750 --> 07:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
exposure to lead exposure most common
 
07:04:46.730 --> 07:04:46.740 align:start position:0%
reason for lead exposure is the lead
 
07:04:49.190 --> 07:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
dust from the friction of paint surfaces
 
07:04:50.930 --> 07:04:50.940 align:start position:0%
when opening Windows and Doors it's not
 
07:04:52.968 --> 07:04:52.978 align:start position:0%
because they nibble on the door door
 
07:04:55.670 --> 07:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
frames the dust gets on the floor then
 
07:04:57.650 --> 07:04:57.660 align:start position:0%
it gets on toys pacifiers and fingers
 
07:04:59.510 --> 07:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
and all of your parents know those
 
07:05:01.490 --> 07:05:01.500 align:start position:0%
things all go in the mouth in addition
 
07:05:04.128 --> 07:05:04.138 align:start position:0%
to lead dust in the home lead levels may
 
07:05:06.230 --> 07:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
be high in the soil of the drip Zone
 
07:05:08.090 --> 07:05:08.100 align:start position:0%
around the house due to leaching of lead
 
07:05:10.850 --> 07:05:10.860 align:start position:0%
from exterior house paint which was
 
07:05:13.968 --> 07:05:13.978 align:start position:0%
before the 70s and in soil adjacent to
 
07:05:15.770 --> 07:05:15.780 align:start position:0%
highways secondary to Persistence of
 
07:05:19.128 --> 07:05:19.138 align:start position:0%
lead in gas prior to the 1970s and in
 
07:05:20.930 --> 07:05:20.940 align:start position:0%
water from lead pipes
 
07:05:20.940 --> 07:05:22.208 align:start position:0%
water from lead pipes
now

07:05:22.208 --> 07:05:22.218 align:start position:0%
now
 
07:05:26.208 --> 07:05:26.218 align:start position:0%
sb147 was passed into law in 2018 and
 
07:05:27.468 --> 07:05:27.478 align:start position:0%
that was the result of a study
 
07:05:30.288 --> 07:05:30.298 align:start position:0%
Commission on lead poisoning that is the
 
07:05:32.030 --> 07:05:32.040 align:start position:0%
bill that established a requirement for
 
07:05:34.730 --> 07:05:34.740 align:start position:0%
bullet blood lead level testing in
 
07:05:36.890 --> 07:05:36.900 align:start position:0%
children by age one
 
07:05:39.890 --> 07:05:39.900 align:start position:0%
and again by age two this bill does not
 
07:05:42.410 --> 07:05:42.420 align:start position:0%
establish that it builds on that
 
07:05:44.270 --> 07:05:44.280 align:start position:0%
was then in order to identify children
 
07:05:46.128 --> 07:05:46.138 align:start position:0%
who have been poisoned and also then
 
07:05:48.468 --> 07:05:48.478 align:start position:0%
therefore identify unsafe housing
 
07:05:51.590 --> 07:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
however compliance with this testing
 
07:05:54.048 --> 07:05:54.058 align:start position:0%
requirement has been low testing peaked
 
07:05:57.048 --> 07:05:57.058 align:start position:0%
in 2019 prior to the pandemic but still
 
07:05:59.448 --> 07:05:59.458 align:start position:0%
only 64 percent of one-year-olds and 75
 
07:06:01.548 --> 07:06:01.558 align:start position:0%
percent of two-year-olds had been tested
 
07:06:04.968 --> 07:06:04.978 align:start position:0%
by 2021 secondary to decrease visits
 
07:06:07.070 --> 07:06:07.080 align:start position:0%
during covet and some recall on testing
 
07:06:09.468 --> 07:06:09.478 align:start position:0%
supplies the testing rates dropped by 20
 
07:06:13.310 --> 07:06:13.320 align:start position:0%
percent to 51 and 60 respectively
 
07:06:15.288 --> 07:06:15.298 align:start position:0%
states that have implemented a
 
07:06:17.030 --> 07:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
requirement to document lead testing
 
07:06:19.128 --> 07:06:19.138 align:start position:0%
upon admission to child care and school
 
07:06:21.968 --> 07:06:21.978 align:start position:0%
have seen increased rates of compliance
 
07:06:24.410 --> 07:06:24.420 align:start position:0%
Maryland's rate increased Maryland when
 
07:06:26.810 --> 07:06:26.820 align:start position:0%
it did it increased compliance by 61
 
07:06:26.820 --> 07:06:28.250 align:start position:0%
it did it increased compliance by 61
percent

07:06:28.250 --> 07:06:28.260 align:start position:0%
percent
 
07:06:31.190 --> 07:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
now in order that a child would not be
 
07:06:33.230 --> 07:06:33.240 align:start position:0%
kept out of school or that a parent
 
07:06:36.230 --> 07:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
would not lose a valuable daycare slot
 
07:06:39.708 --> 07:06:39.718 align:start position:0%
if you look at lines 9 to 11 and 23 to
 
07:06:42.530 --> 07:06:42.540 align:start position:0%
24 provision is made to Grant a
 
07:06:45.048 --> 07:06:45.058 align:start position:0%
six-month grace period to remedy the
 
07:06:47.510 --> 07:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
deficiency but do notice the typo in
 
07:06:50.150 --> 07:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
line 10 which should read granted not
 
07:06:50.160 --> 07:06:52.190 align:start position:0%
line 10 which should read granted not
grated

07:06:52.190 --> 07:06:52.200 align:start position:0%
grated
 
07:06:54.590 --> 07:06:54.600 align:start position:0%
parents have the right to exempt their
 
07:06:57.010 --> 07:06:57.020 align:start position:0%
child from lead testing under
 
07:06:59.628 --> 07:06:59.638 align:start position:0%
rsa-130a5c that's already existed in law
 
07:07:03.170 --> 07:07:03.180 align:start position:0%
an HB 342 does not interfere with their
 
07:07:06.110 --> 07:07:06.120 align:start position:0%
ability to exercise that right exemption
 
07:07:08.810 --> 07:07:08.820 align:start position:0%
of testing would not serve as a barrier
 
07:07:10.850 --> 07:07:10.860 align:start position:0%
to being admitted to school or child
 
07:07:10.860 --> 07:07:12.410 align:start position:0%
to being admitted to school or child
care

07:07:12.410 --> 07:07:12.420 align:start position:0%
care
 
07:07:15.770 --> 07:07:15.780 align:start position:0%
now in 2022 HB 1642 passed through the
 
07:07:17.570 --> 07:07:17.580 align:start position:0%
house initially but in finance concern
 
07:07:19.250 --> 07:07:19.260 align:start position:0%
was raised about the administrative
 
07:07:21.590 --> 07:07:21.600 align:start position:0%
burden on the schools and that would
 
07:07:23.208 --> 07:07:23.218 align:start position:0%
cause kids to be turned away from child
 
07:07:24.650 --> 07:07:24.660 align:start position:0%
care in school
 
07:07:27.170 --> 07:07:27.180 align:start position:0%
but as I just noted it will not turn
 
07:07:29.150 --> 07:07:29.160 align:start position:0%
kids away from child care in school you
 
07:07:30.830 --> 07:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
can still be Exempted that's not a
 
07:07:30.840 --> 07:07:32.330 align:start position:0%
can still be Exempted that's not a
problem

07:07:32.330 --> 07:07:32.340 align:start position:0%
problem
 
07:07:36.708 --> 07:07:36.718 align:start position:0%
in addition the burden on schools and
 
07:07:38.330 --> 07:07:38.340 align:start position:0%
child care will really be extremely
 
07:07:38.340 --> 07:07:39.468 align:start position:0%
child care will really be extremely
small

07:07:39.468 --> 07:07:39.478 align:start position:0%
small
 
07:07:41.628 --> 07:07:41.638 align:start position:0%
schools and child care facilities
 
07:07:44.270 --> 07:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
already must maintain a health form on
 
07:07:46.490 --> 07:07:46.500 align:start position:0%
each child Which documents the
 
07:07:48.650 --> 07:07:48.660 align:start position:0%
immunization status the New Hampshire
 
07:07:50.930 --> 07:07:50.940 align:start position:0%
Early Childhood Health form which is
 
07:07:52.490 --> 07:07:52.500 align:start position:0%
currently in use in many schools and
 
07:07:54.410 --> 07:07:54.420 align:start position:0%
child care facilities for documentation
 
07:07:57.410 --> 07:07:57.420 align:start position:0%
of immunizations already includes a
 
07:07:59.690 --> 07:07:59.700 align:start position:0%
place to document blood lead level
 
07:08:02.990 --> 07:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
testing results Dartmouth just added a
 
07:08:04.968 --> 07:08:04.978 align:start position:0%
space for documentation of the lead
 
07:08:07.010 --> 07:08:07.020 align:start position:0%
level to their health form that they
 
07:08:09.350 --> 07:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
automatically generate from the EHR for
 
07:08:10.968 --> 07:08:10.978 align:start position:0%
the immunization history
 
07:08:13.788 --> 07:08:13.798 align:start position:0%
as a result the documentation of the
 
07:08:15.708 --> 07:08:15.718 align:start position:0%
lead level in the school should probably
 
07:08:17.510 --> 07:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
add less than a minute because you're
 
07:08:18.650 --> 07:08:18.660 align:start position:0%
already looking at the form you just
 
07:08:19.850 --> 07:08:19.860 align:start position:0%
check that the lead level has been
 
07:08:22.128 --> 07:08:22.138 align:start position:0%
reported as well probably less than a
 
07:08:23.868 --> 07:08:23.878 align:start position:0%
minute per child and if the school
 
07:08:25.670 --> 07:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
documentation requirement helps just
 
07:08:27.948 --> 07:08:27.958 align:start position:0%
catch one child per year with lead
 
07:08:30.288 --> 07:08:30.298 align:start position:0%
poisoning who can then be appropriately
 
07:08:33.048 --> 07:08:33.058 align:start position:0%
treated to prevent learning disabilities
 
07:08:34.670 --> 07:08:34.680 align:start position:0%
that school would save much more money
 
07:08:36.230 --> 07:08:36.240 align:start position:0%
on their special ed costs than would
 
07:08:37.788 --> 07:08:37.798 align:start position:0%
ever be expended on the administrative
 
07:08:39.708 --> 07:08:39.718 align:start position:0%
work of compliance for the whole school
 
07:08:41.150 --> 07:08:41.160 align:start position:0%
for a year
 
07:08:42.948 --> 07:08:42.958 align:start position:0%
now I've also been informed though that
 
07:08:44.930 --> 07:08:44.940 align:start position:0%
some stakeholders have concern about the
 
07:08:47.868 --> 07:08:47.878 align:start position:0%
lack of an age limit in this bill and it
 
07:08:50.330 --> 07:08:50.340 align:start position:0%
probably is not necessary for older
 
07:08:51.890 --> 07:08:51.900 align:start position:0%
children who were in after school
 
07:08:54.410 --> 07:08:54.420 align:start position:0%
programs to be included this is not in
 
07:08:56.270 --> 07:08:56.280 align:start position:0%
my written testimony
 
07:08:58.090 --> 07:08:58.100 align:start position:0%
um because I just became aware of that
 
07:09:00.948 --> 07:09:00.958 align:start position:0%
you know one could place an age limit in
 
07:09:03.590 --> 07:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
this bill that would only apply to ages
 
07:09:06.230 --> 07:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
nine months to six years old so that a
 
07:09:07.730 --> 07:09:07.740 align:start position:0%
kid who's in middle school that was
 
07:09:09.288 --> 07:09:09.298 align:start position:0%
going to an after school doesn't have to
 
07:09:10.850 --> 07:09:10.860 align:start position:0%
comply with this that would certainly be
 
07:09:13.070 --> 07:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
very reasonable because the focus is on
 
07:09:15.530 --> 07:09:15.540 align:start position:0%
kids six and under the reason for saying
 
07:09:17.208 --> 07:09:17.218 align:start position:0%
nine months is that some kids go into
 
07:09:19.490 --> 07:09:19.500 align:start position:0%
Child Care earlier than nine months and
 
07:09:21.110 --> 07:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
it's not routine to be testing before
 
07:09:23.570 --> 07:09:23.580 align:start position:0%
nine months it's the requirement is by a
 
07:09:25.368 --> 07:09:25.378 align:start position:0%
year and as when your checks usually go
 
07:09:26.750 --> 07:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
on between about nine months and 12
 
07:09:26.760 --> 07:09:28.010 align:start position:0%
on between about nine months and 12
months

07:09:28.010 --> 07:09:28.020 align:start position:0%
months
 
07:09:28.020 --> 07:09:29.170 align:start position:0%
months
um

07:09:29.170 --> 07:09:29.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:09:31.730 --> 07:09:31.740 align:start position:0%
the other thing is and I just became
 
07:09:34.190 --> 07:09:34.200 align:start position:0%
aware one came in here that you guys
 
07:09:36.530 --> 07:09:36.540 align:start position:0%
were given a memorandum from house
 
07:09:38.628 --> 07:09:38.638 align:start position:0%
committee services that talks about the
 
07:09:41.448 --> 07:09:41.458 align:start position:0%
legislative history of 1642 and it was
 
07:09:45.530 --> 07:09:45.540 align:start position:0%
also mentioned that uh the by the report
 
07:09:47.810 --> 07:09:47.820 align:start position:0%
from Jess Edwards and the one Finance
 
07:09:50.930 --> 07:09:50.940 align:start position:0%
handled the bill that the DHHS should
 
07:09:53.208 --> 07:09:53.218 align:start position:0%
have a public education program they
 
07:09:55.490 --> 07:09:55.500 align:start position:0%
already do they have a board book they
 
07:09:57.350 --> 07:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
have posters they have all kinds of
 
07:10:00.110 --> 07:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
stuff so they are already doing that
 
07:10:02.448 --> 07:10:02.458 align:start position:0%
so in summary the goal of this bill is
 
07:10:04.850 --> 07:10:04.860 align:start position:0%
to improve compliance with blood lead
 
07:10:07.850 --> 07:10:07.860 align:start position:0%
level testing of our children when they
 
07:10:10.010 --> 07:10:10.020 align:start position:0%
are very young to allow early
 
07:10:12.650 --> 07:10:12.660 align:start position:0%
intervention and to identify unsafe
 
07:10:15.650 --> 07:10:15.660 align:start position:0%
housing it's time to get the let out so
 
07:10:18.170 --> 07:10:18.180 align:start position:0%
I'll be glad to take questions about how
 
07:10:19.430 --> 07:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
the bill is constructed it's really
 
07:10:21.048 --> 07:10:21.058 align:start position:0%
pretty simple and short but I begot to
 
07:10:24.948 --> 07:10:24.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:27.910 --> 07:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and also thank you
 
07:10:31.490 --> 07:10:31.500 align:start position:0%
honorable doctor
 
07:10:34.610 --> 07:10:34.620 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:36.530 --> 07:10:36.540 align:start position:0%
it's good to see you again yeah
 
07:10:39.948 --> 07:10:39.958 align:start position:0%
um as we discussed last year when we saw
 
07:10:42.948 --> 07:10:42.958 align:start position:0%
either this bill or a similar one the
 
07:10:45.590 --> 07:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
the testing really isn't in my mind
 
07:10:48.590 --> 07:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
isn't really the issue and how easily
 
07:10:51.170 --> 07:10:51.180 align:start position:0%
you can document all this the real
 
07:10:53.510 --> 07:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
problem comes when you actually Discover
 
07:10:56.090 --> 07:10:56.100 align:start position:0%
it and then what happens to the
 
07:10:59.448 --> 07:10:59.458 align:start position:0%
landlords that own the property or uh or
 
07:11:01.850 --> 07:11:01.860 align:start position:0%
the homeowner that owns the property and
 
07:11:04.610 --> 07:11:04.620 align:start position:0%
we live in a state that has some really
 
07:11:06.650 --> 07:11:06.660 align:start position:0%
old buildings so how do we how do we
 
07:11:09.590 --> 07:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
deal with the getting the lead out
 
07:11:12.110 --> 07:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
okay well that she I knew you'd like
 
07:11:12.120 --> 07:11:12.890 align:start position:0%
okay well that she I knew you'd like
that

07:11:12.890 --> 07:11:12.900 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:11:14.448 --> 07:11:14.458 align:start position:0%
um okay that gets a little more
 
07:11:15.890 --> 07:11:15.900 align:start position:0%
complicated that's what a lot of uh
 
07:11:19.430 --> 07:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
sp147 in 2018 dealt with there are funds
 
07:11:21.110 --> 07:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
available for remediation first of all
 
07:11:22.968 --> 07:11:22.978 align:start position:0%
it's uh at the hearing last year
 
07:11:24.230 --> 07:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
somebody made a comment well why don't
 
07:11:25.610 --> 07:11:25.620 align:start position:0%
we just remediate all the buildings
 
07:11:28.070 --> 07:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
that's been estimated to cost about 1
 
07:11:30.530 --> 07:11:30.540 align:start position:0%
billion with the B dollars and I don't
 
07:11:32.030 --> 07:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
think we want to increase our budget by
 
07:11:33.590 --> 07:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
eight percent so I don't think that's
 
07:11:35.390 --> 07:11:35.400 align:start position:0%
going to happen this year but the bottom
 
07:11:37.070 --> 07:11:37.080 align:start position:0%
line is that's why one identifies the
 
07:11:39.770 --> 07:11:39.780 align:start position:0%
at-risk houses so for example
 
07:11:42.410 --> 07:11:42.420 align:start position:0%
um if uh I'm I'm I happen to be in a
 
07:11:43.670 --> 07:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
somewhat newer house but if we're in an
 
07:11:45.048 --> 07:11:45.058 align:start position:0%
older house it's not going to be a big
 
07:11:46.788 --> 07:11:46.798 align:start position:0%
deal because I don't have kids there I
 
07:11:48.590 --> 07:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
do have grandkids but we still you know
 
07:11:50.150 --> 07:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
don't have to worry about it but the
 
07:11:52.368 --> 07:11:52.378 align:start position:0%
thing is that you there are different
 
07:11:55.128 --> 07:11:55.138 align:start position:0%
levels uh different times when there are
 
07:11:56.810 --> 07:11:56.820 align:start position:0%
action levels like if you're over if
 
07:11:58.610 --> 07:11:58.620 align:start position:0%
you're three you have to give I hope I
 
07:12:00.048 --> 07:12:00.058 align:start position:0%
got these correct you have to give
 
07:12:01.968 --> 07:12:01.978 align:start position:0%
information to the parents about it and
 
07:12:03.350 --> 07:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
then there are higher levels when you're
 
07:12:05.570 --> 07:12:05.580 align:start position:0%
over six and so on and so forth that
 
07:12:07.670 --> 07:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
action has to be taken and Remediation
 
07:12:09.288 --> 07:12:09.298 align:start position:0%
needs to happen but there are also our
 
07:12:11.530 --> 07:12:11.540 align:start position:0%
funds to help with that as well
 
07:12:14.270 --> 07:12:14.280 align:start position:0%
so the goal of this is again to try to
 
07:12:18.048 --> 07:12:18.058 align:start position:0%
prevent and it's not something which
 
07:12:20.750 --> 07:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
is going to be impossible to it's not
 
07:12:22.610 --> 07:12:22.620 align:start position:0%
like the person has to then move out of
 
07:12:23.810 --> 07:12:23.820 align:start position:0%
that housing and become homeless that's
 
07:12:26.650 --> 07:12:26.660 align:start position:0%
not the issue we try to help the the the
 
07:12:28.910 --> 07:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
department tries to help them to deal
 
07:12:30.530 --> 07:12:30.540 align:start position:0%
with it and there are a lot of resources
 
07:12:32.930 --> 07:12:32.940 align:start position:0%
and actually okay this is somewhat
 
07:12:34.610 --> 07:12:34.620 align:start position:0%
personal for me
 
07:12:37.850 --> 07:12:37.860 align:start position:0%
um we have a two year and three month
 
07:12:40.730 --> 07:12:40.740 align:start position:0%
old grandson who's being raised in Eaton
 
07:12:44.930 --> 07:12:44.940 align:start position:0%
and it lives in a 1830 house and
 
07:12:46.910 --> 07:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
um I found that there was some lead I
 
07:12:48.530 --> 07:12:48.540 align:start position:0%
did a bunch of soil testing around it's
 
07:12:50.150 --> 07:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
in the drip Zone and so on and so forth
 
07:12:52.070 --> 07:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
It's been partially remediated but in
 
07:12:53.930 --> 07:12:53.940 align:start position:0%
spite of that he still tested out with a
 
07:12:56.510 --> 07:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
blood double test of three and now
 
07:12:58.128 --> 07:12:58.138 align:start position:0%
unfortunately even his was a little bit
 
07:12:59.750 --> 07:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
delayed because of the problem with the
 
07:13:01.910 --> 07:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
testing supplies but being in a high
 
07:13:03.110 --> 07:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
risk house they should have just
 
07:13:04.968 --> 07:13:04.978 align:start position:0%
proceeded to the Venus test immediately
 
07:13:07.010 --> 07:13:07.020 align:start position:0%
because that's what you do you can do as
 
07:13:09.350 --> 07:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
well in any case
 
07:13:11.270 --> 07:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
um at two years and three months he's
 
07:13:13.010 --> 07:13:13.020 align:start position:0%
just finally beginning to use some words
 
07:13:15.708 --> 07:13:15.718 align:start position:0%
but the uh the school actually his child
 
07:13:18.230 --> 07:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
care actually uh helped facilitate
 
07:13:19.968 --> 07:13:19.978 align:start position:0%
getting some Speech Pathology work for
 
07:13:22.368 --> 07:13:22.378 align:start position:0%
him because it's not we can't know it's
 
07:13:23.810 --> 07:13:23.820 align:start position:0%
from the lead but there's certainly a
 
07:13:25.670 --> 07:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
reason to believe it is because that is
 
07:13:28.070 --> 07:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
one of the cause one of the side effects
 
07:13:30.110 --> 07:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
so the goal is to you know improve
 
07:13:31.430 --> 07:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
that's why you want to identify the
 
07:13:33.288 --> 07:13:33.298 align:start position:0%
unsafe housing in addition to that
 
07:13:35.090 --> 07:13:35.100 align:start position:0%
particular kit
 
07:13:36.230 --> 07:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
another question yeah representative
 
07:13:37.850 --> 07:13:37.860 align:start position:0%
Shapiro thank you
 
07:13:42.170 --> 07:13:42.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and um excuse me
 
07:13:44.750 --> 07:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
um if I'm missing something here but it
 
07:13:46.250 --> 07:13:46.260 align:start position:0%
seems like in the first part when
 
07:13:48.468 --> 07:13:48.478 align:start position:0%
children go to school the mechanism by
 
07:13:50.990 --> 07:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
which this gets a lead test gets
 
07:13:54.230 --> 07:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
recorded is because there has to be a a
 
07:13:56.990 --> 07:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
child's physical prior to entering
 
07:13:57.000 --> 07:13:57.890 align:start position:0%
child's physical prior to entering
School

07:13:57.890 --> 07:13:57.900 align:start position:0%
School
 
07:14:00.770 --> 07:14:00.780 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't say anything about that
 
07:14:03.830 --> 07:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
in regard to a child entering take a
 
07:14:07.070 --> 07:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
daycare agency it just says that it will
 
07:14:07.080 --> 07:14:07.788 align:start position:0%
daycare agency it just says that it will
um

07:14:07.788 --> 07:14:07.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:14:10.128 --> 07:14:10.138 align:start position:0%
Health form she'll include it so is is
 
07:14:12.590 --> 07:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
the mechanism the same does it does do
 
07:14:14.930 --> 07:14:14.940 align:start position:0%
the does there need to be a physical
 
07:14:17.810 --> 07:14:17.820 align:start position:0%
before they go to daycare as well that's
 
07:14:20.448 --> 07:14:20.458 align:start position:0%
in section two section one is a physical
 
07:14:23.208 --> 07:14:23.218 align:start position:0%
examination of pupils and that is uh
 
07:14:24.708 --> 07:14:24.718 align:start position:0%
prior to first entry into a public
 
07:14:27.288 --> 07:14:27.298 align:start position:0%
school system section two beginning of
 
07:14:29.570 --> 07:14:29.580 align:start position:0%
line 14 that is about child care
 
07:14:31.128 --> 07:14:31.138 align:start position:0%
residential care and child placing
 
07:14:33.410 --> 07:14:33.420 align:start position:0%
agencies and that is that every each
 
07:14:35.990 --> 07:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
child care agency so that's going to be
 
07:14:38.270 --> 07:14:38.280 align:start position:0%
like your local daycare she'll maintain
 
07:14:40.250 --> 07:14:40.260 align:start position:0%
the same records so that's that is
 
07:14:42.048 --> 07:14:42.058 align:start position:0%
covered in both of those
 
07:14:44.090 --> 07:14:44.100 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up but it doesn't say
 
07:14:45.770 --> 07:14:45.780 align:start position:0%
anything about requiring a physical
 
07:14:49.070 --> 07:14:49.080 align:start position:0%
before you go actually no you're right
 
07:14:50.150 --> 07:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
because it's slightly different what
 
07:14:51.530 --> 07:14:51.540 align:start position:0%
they do in the child care is they
 
07:14:53.270 --> 07:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
maintain records because they still have
 
07:14:56.990 --> 07:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
to uh document the immunization and so
 
07:14:58.730 --> 07:14:58.740 align:start position:0%
usually what happens is apparent you
 
07:15:00.230 --> 07:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
know so it goes to their Dock and they
 
07:15:01.670 --> 07:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
get the health form that has
 
07:15:03.288 --> 07:15:03.298 align:start position:0%
immunizations and would have the blood
 
07:15:05.570 --> 07:15:05.580 align:start position:0%
test on it as well so it's not adding a
 
07:15:08.448 --> 07:15:08.458 align:start position:0%
requirement to parents who because they
 
07:15:10.070 --> 07:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
would have to get come with medical
 
07:15:12.770 --> 07:15:12.780 align:start position:0%
records anyway as best I understand the
 
07:15:14.330 --> 07:15:14.340 align:start position:0%
child care licensing people can answer
 
07:15:16.670 --> 07:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
that probably more precisely than I yeah
 
07:15:18.350 --> 07:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
and actually I would add one thing too
 
07:15:20.628 --> 07:15:20.638 align:start position:0%
for representative King's comment when
 
07:15:22.910 --> 07:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
it does identify to it there's also
 
07:15:25.070 --> 07:15:25.080 align:start position:0%
things one can do as I said to lessen
 
07:15:27.048 --> 07:15:27.058 align:start position:0%
the exposure things like frequent wiping
 
07:15:29.208 --> 07:15:29.218 align:start position:0%
down a surface is using a HEPA vacuum to
 
07:15:30.708 --> 07:15:30.718 align:start position:0%
make sure that the dust gets tracked in
 
07:15:32.628 --> 07:15:32.638 align:start position:0%
from the drip Zone gets cleaned up you
 
07:15:34.128 --> 07:15:34.138 align:start position:0%
know all those kind of things washing
 
07:15:35.930 --> 07:15:35.940 align:start position:0%
the kids hands before they eat and
 
07:15:37.368 --> 07:15:37.378 align:start position:0%
trying to you can't keep stuff out of
 
07:15:39.830 --> 07:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
kids mouths so that's hopeless
 
07:15:41.810 --> 07:15:41.820 align:start position:0%
representative Palazzo
 
07:15:44.208 --> 07:15:44.218 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
07:15:47.570 --> 07:15:47.580 align:start position:0%
taking my question so you testified that
 
07:15:52.128 --> 07:15:52.138 align:start position:0%
uh testing peaked in 2019 and I'm
 
07:15:55.010 --> 07:15:55.020 align:start position:0%
looking into this uh lead exposure in
 
07:15:57.590 --> 07:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that I believe it shows
 
07:16:01.128 --> 07:16:01.138 align:start position:0%
that uh it peaked in 2019 but actually
 
07:16:06.530 --> 07:16:06.540 align:start position:0%
the number of positive tests positive
 
07:16:11.448 --> 07:16:11.458 align:start position:0%
results were going down uh since two
 
07:16:14.208 --> 07:16:14.218 align:start position:0%
years before which tells me that
 
07:16:18.170 --> 07:16:18.180 align:start position:0%
situation may be improving and with us
 
07:16:21.350 --> 07:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
using new technology it looks like this
 
07:16:23.690 --> 07:16:23.700 align:start position:0%
situation will be improving in the
 
07:16:26.750 --> 07:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
future so could it be that it eventually
 
07:16:31.910 --> 07:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
solved itself and as you said we can't
 
07:16:35.930 --> 07:16:35.940 align:start position:0%
like replace all the pipe lead pipes and
 
07:16:39.468 --> 07:16:39.478 align:start position:0%
the lead paint this year but maybe we
 
07:16:42.948 --> 07:16:42.958 align:start position:0%
can put some Sunset Amendment maybe in
 
07:16:45.410 --> 07:16:45.420 align:start position:0%
five or ten years we don't need this
 
07:16:47.570 --> 07:16:47.580 align:start position:0%
testing anymore what are you thought
 
07:16:51.468 --> 07:16:51.478 align:start position:0%
thank you and actually the testing rate
 
07:16:53.810 --> 07:16:53.820 align:start position:0%
is dropped but if we look at figure
 
07:16:55.310 --> 07:16:55.320 align:start position:0%
three I think we're looking at the same
 
07:16:58.070 --> 07:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
thing the number of children 72 months
 
07:17:01.430 --> 07:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
or younger above the Action level that's
 
07:17:05.330 --> 07:17:05.340 align:start position:0%
actually increased in 21 significantly
 
07:17:05.340 --> 07:17:06.410 align:start position:0%
actually increased in 21 significantly
um

07:17:06.410 --> 07:17:06.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:17:08.930 --> 07:17:08.940 align:start position:0%
at least that's my understanding so the
 
07:17:10.850 --> 07:17:10.860 align:start position:0%
bottom line is the lead isn't going to
 
07:17:12.948 --> 07:17:12.958 align:start position:0%
go away in 10 years in our housing stock
 
07:17:14.810 --> 07:17:14.820 align:start position:0%
or our our
 
07:17:18.170 --> 07:17:18.180 align:start position:0%
um water and actually in water varies a
 
07:17:20.208 --> 07:17:20.218 align:start position:0%
great deal obviously I mean a lot of the
 
07:17:22.070 --> 07:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
houses don't have any lead water problem
 
07:17:24.048 --> 07:17:24.058 align:start position:0%
anyway I'm in an area where almost
 
07:17:25.968 --> 07:17:25.978 align:start position:0%
everything's in a well you don't have
 
07:17:28.190 --> 07:17:28.200 align:start position:0%
Municipal supplies usually but the house
 
07:17:30.170 --> 07:17:30.180 align:start position:0%
may have an old lead Supply but if it's
 
07:17:32.208 --> 07:17:32.218 align:start position:0%
clean it's clean but as far as the lead
 
07:17:35.270 --> 07:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
until we get until all of our old houses
 
07:17:37.610 --> 07:17:37.620 align:start position:0%
fall down and are replaced it's going to
 
07:17:39.110 --> 07:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
continue to be a problem
 
07:17:41.030 --> 07:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
so I don't see any reason to Sunset it
 
07:17:44.090 --> 07:17:44.100 align:start position:0%
because it's a highly significant risk
 
07:17:47.990 --> 07:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:49.788 --> 07:17:49.798 align:start position:0%
see no other questions
 
07:17:51.770 --> 07:17:51.780 align:start position:0%
good thank you sure thing thank you very
 
07:17:51.780 --> 07:17:54.788 align:start position:0%
good thank you sure thing thank you very
much

07:17:54.788 --> 07:17:54.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:56.628 --> 07:17:56.638 align:start position:0%
and I don't think they'll be bothering
 
07:18:01.190 --> 07:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:03.230 --> 07:18:03.240 align:start position:0%

can you hear me okay okay I can uh good
 
07:18:24.468 --> 07:18:24.478 align:start position:0%
afternoon members of the committee for

is the divisions healthy homes and
 
07:18:39.468 --> 07:18:39.478 align:start position:0%
environment section administrator
 
07:18:41.090 --> 07:18:41.100 align:start position:0%
the department would like to thank the
 
07:18:43.190 --> 07:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
sponsors of this bill for their interest
 
07:18:45.788 --> 07:18:45.798 align:start position:0%
in supporting our vulnerable populations
 
07:18:48.410 --> 07:18:48.420 align:start position:0%
bloodlet testing is critically important
 
07:18:50.930 --> 07:18:50.940 align:start position:0%
to ensure the health of children in New
 
07:18:53.150 --> 07:18:53.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as the only way to know if a
 
07:18:55.368 --> 07:18:55.378 align:start position:0%
child is poisoned by lead is through a
 
07:18:58.430 --> 07:18:58.440 align:start position:0%
blood lead test any amount of lead in a
 
07:19:00.830 --> 07:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
child's body is dangerous and can cause
 
07:19:03.350 --> 07:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
Health cognitive impairment and
 
07:19:05.868 --> 07:19:05.878 align:start position:0%
behavioral problems these health effects
 
07:19:07.250 --> 07:19:07.260 align:start position:0%
are more harmful to young children
 
07:19:10.190 --> 07:19:10.200 align:start position:0%
because their bodies are developing and
 
07:19:12.948 --> 07:19:12.958 align:start position:0%
growing young children often put hands
 
07:19:14.690 --> 07:19:14.700 align:start position:0%
and other objects that may be
 
07:19:16.548 --> 07:19:16.558 align:start position:0%
contaminated with lead dust into their
 
07:19:19.010 --> 07:19:19.020 align:start position:0%
mouths so they are more likely to be
 
07:19:21.110 --> 07:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
directly impacted by lead than older
 
07:19:21.120 --> 07:19:23.110 align:start position:0%
directly impacted by lead than older
children

07:19:23.110 --> 07:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
children
 
07:19:26.150 --> 07:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
by testing at ages 1 and 2 parents and
 
07:19:28.670 --> 07:19:28.680 align:start position:0%
health care providers can learn if
 
07:19:31.368 --> 07:19:31.378 align:start position:0%
mitigation strategies are needed to
 
07:19:33.590 --> 07:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
reduce further exposure prior to
 
07:19:36.048 --> 07:19:36.058 align:start position:0%
negative health effects under state law
 
07:19:37.910 --> 07:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
currently all children in New Hampshire
 
07:19:40.430 --> 07:19:40.440 align:start position:0%
are required to have a blood lead level
 
07:19:43.310 --> 07:19:43.320 align:start position:0%
test at ages 1 and a second test at age
 
07:19:46.190 --> 07:19:46.200 align:start position:0%
two the department also recommends blood
 
07:19:48.708 --> 07:19:48.718 align:start position:0%
lead testing for all children ages three
 
07:19:51.350 --> 07:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
to six who have not been tested at one
 
07:19:52.430 --> 07:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
or two
 
07:19:54.288 --> 07:19:54.298 align:start position:0%
according to the Centers for Disease
 
07:19:56.510 --> 07:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
Control and prevention similar lead
 
07:19:58.430 --> 07:19:58.440 align:start position:0%
testing requirements exist for all
 
07:20:00.530 --> 07:20:00.540 align:start position:0%
children enrolled in Medicaid and the
 
07:20:02.170 --> 07:20:02.180 align:start position:0%
American Academy of Pediatrics
 
07:20:04.208 --> 07:20:04.218 align:start position:0%
recommends that providers test
 
07:20:06.708 --> 07:20:06.718 align:start position:0%
asymptomatic children for elevated blood
 
07:20:09.770 --> 07:20:09.780 align:start position:0%
lead concentrations according to federal
 
07:20:12.350 --> 07:20:12.360 align:start position:0%
state and local requirements
 
07:20:14.390 --> 07:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
as noted in the Department's most recent
 
07:20:16.610 --> 07:20:16.620 align:start position:0%
lead exposure data brief which I believe
 
07:20:18.490 --> 07:20:18.500 align:start position:0%
we're passing around now
 
07:20:21.368 --> 07:20:21.378 align:start position:0%
in 2021
 
07:20:24.708 --> 07:20:24.718 align:start position:0%
5360 fewer children had blood lead level
 
07:20:28.128 --> 07:20:28.138 align:start position:0%
tests since 2019. in large part this was
 
07:20:31.010 --> 07:20:31.020 align:start position:0%
due to the covid-19 pandemic and a
 
07:20:33.890 --> 07:20:33.900 align:start position:0%
nationwide recall in the in-office blood
 
07:20:37.190 --> 07:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
lead testing supplies this represents a
 
07:20:39.590 --> 07:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
25 percent drop in the number of
 
07:20:42.170 --> 07:20:42.180 align:start position:0%
children tested in New Hampshire for
 
07:20:45.890 --> 07:20:45.900 align:start position:0%
blood lead levels since 2019.
 
07:20:49.850 --> 07:20:49.860 align:start position:0%
as introduced HP 342 is well intended
 
07:20:52.030 --> 07:20:52.040 align:start position:0%
but the requirements for blood lead test
 
07:20:55.250 --> 07:20:55.260 align:start position:0%
for entry into public schools and child
 
07:20:58.250 --> 07:20:58.260 align:start position:0%
day care facilities is Broad it appears
 
07:20:59.990 --> 07:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
that the text would require children of
 
07:21:03.110 --> 07:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
all ages not just young children to
 
07:21:05.150 --> 07:21:05.160 align:start position:0%
provide blood tests prior to entry to
 
07:21:06.410 --> 07:21:06.420 align:start position:0%
public school
 
07:21:08.570 --> 07:21:08.580 align:start position:0%
in addition the same requirement could
 
07:21:10.730 --> 07:21:10.740 align:start position:0%
apply to Children older than six
 
07:21:12.708 --> 07:21:12.718 align:start position:0%
attending a licensed after-school
 
07:21:12.718 --> 07:21:13.910 align:start position:0%
attending a licensed after-school
program

07:21:13.910 --> 07:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
program
 
07:21:15.770 --> 07:21:15.780 align:start position:0%
while the department is very supportive
 
07:21:17.510 --> 07:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
of innovative ways to promote lead
 
07:21:19.730 --> 07:21:19.740 align:start position:0%
testing we recognize that some of these
 
07:21:21.468 --> 07:21:21.478 align:start position:0%
requirements could place additional
 
07:21:23.930 --> 07:21:23.940 align:start position:0%
burden on school and child care
 
07:21:26.390 --> 07:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
administrators the department feels that
 
07:21:29.868 --> 07:21:29.878 align:start position:0%
HB 342 could be strengthened by focusing
 
07:21:32.510 --> 07:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
on younger children ages one to six
 
07:21:35.270 --> 07:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
years of age which I believe the sponsor
 
07:21:38.150 --> 07:21:38.160 align:start position:0%
of the bill mentioned in the testimony I
 
07:21:40.670 --> 07:21:40.680 align:start position:0%
do begin wrapping up your testimony I'd
 
07:21:42.230 --> 07:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
just like to note that similar efforts
 
07:21:43.788 --> 07:21:43.798 align:start position:0%
have been established in the City of
 
07:21:45.708 --> 07:21:45.718 align:start position:0%
Claremont The Claremont School Board
 
07:21:48.708 --> 07:21:48.718 align:start position:0%
instituted a policy in 2017 that
 
07:21:50.570 --> 07:21:50.580 align:start position:0%
required both the one and two-year-old
 
07:21:53.090 --> 07:21:53.100 align:start position:0%
blood lead level test be documented on
 
07:21:55.430 --> 07:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
the physical examination form for entry
 
07:21:58.310 --> 07:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
into pre-K in kindergarten thank you for
 
07:21:59.930 --> 07:21:59.940 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to provide this
 
07:22:01.910 --> 07:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
testimony today we would certainly be
 
07:22:03.590 --> 07:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
willing to work with the sponsor on any
 
07:22:06.048 --> 07:22:06.058 align:start position:0%
revisions to the language and we'd be
 
07:22:07.750 --> 07:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions
 
07:22:10.010 --> 07:22:10.020 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you Mr
 
07:22:11.468 --> 07:22:11.478 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for being here
 
07:22:13.368 --> 07:22:13.378 align:start position:0%
there had already been mention of
 
07:22:15.048 --> 07:22:15.058 align:start position:0%
changing the child Child Care section
 
07:22:17.690 --> 07:22:17.700 align:start position:0%
would you be in favor in the school
 
07:22:21.110 --> 07:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
entry to say Exempted under RSA 130 a5c
 
07:22:25.150 --> 07:22:25.160 align:start position:0%
or entering after age six
 
07:22:28.910 --> 07:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
so the language would focus on I'm sorry
 
07:22:31.490 --> 07:22:31.500 align:start position:0%
this is for the school entry one yeah
 
07:22:33.468 --> 07:22:33.478 align:start position:0%
which you're intending to catch that
 
07:22:35.930 --> 07:22:35.940 align:start position:0%
nine month through six year old yes if
 
07:22:37.430 --> 07:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
that language because you're worried
 
07:22:39.048 --> 07:22:39.058 align:start position:0%
about casting too broad a net in the
 
07:22:41.930 --> 07:22:41.940 align:start position:0%
school system said unexempted under this
 
07:22:46.368 --> 07:22:46.378 align:start position:0%
RSA or entering after age six yes we
 
07:22:48.468 --> 07:22:48.478 align:start position:0%
could I think that would be so it would
 
07:22:51.288 --> 07:22:51.298 align:start position:0%
be really focusing on years one to six
 
07:22:54.468 --> 07:22:54.478 align:start position:0%
for those for those tests yeah thank you
 
07:22:59.270 --> 07:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:00.650 --> 07:23:00.660 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
07:23:00.660 --> 07:23:03.830 align:start position:0%
any other questions
representative

07:23:03.830 --> 07:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:05.930 --> 07:23:05.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
07:23:08.628 --> 07:23:08.638 align:start position:0%
taking my question help me understand uh
 
07:23:10.610 --> 07:23:10.620 align:start position:0%
Does it include use
 
07:23:13.430 --> 07:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
new requirements for Destiny is it just
 
07:23:16.368 --> 07:23:16.378 align:start position:0%
making sure that previous requirements
 
07:23:18.410 --> 07:23:18.420 align:start position:0%
for testing are followed
 
07:23:21.288 --> 07:23:21.298 align:start position:0%
so no it doesn't require any new testing
 
07:23:24.850 --> 07:23:24.860 align:start position:0%
So currently in state law RSA 130a
 
07:23:28.250 --> 07:23:28.260 align:start position:0%
does require tests be done at ages one
 
07:23:29.690 --> 07:23:29.700 align:start position:0%
and two
 
07:23:32.150 --> 07:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
um and uh there is an exemption parents
 
07:23:33.708 --> 07:23:33.718 align:start position:0%
there is an exemption that currently
 
07:23:35.990 --> 07:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
exists in that law as well so there's no
 
07:23:39.070 --> 07:23:39.080 align:start position:0%
additional testing requirements in this
 
07:23:48.410 --> 07:23:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:54.350 --> 07:23:54.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:55.788 --> 07:23:55.798 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is
 
07:24:04.910 --> 07:24:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:06.530 --> 07:24:06.540 align:start position:0%
I had no idea I'd have such relevant
 
07:24:08.868 --> 07:24:08.878 align:start position:0%
testimony all day so I'm sorry I'll be
 
07:24:08.878 --> 07:24:09.650 align:start position:0%
testimony all day so I'm sorry I'll be
quick

07:24:09.650 --> 07:24:09.660 align:start position:0%
quick
 
07:24:11.690 --> 07:24:11.700 align:start position:0%
um so my brother's 34 he was lead pain
 
07:24:13.548 --> 07:24:13.558 align:start position:0%
poisoned when he was two years old in
 
07:24:17.090 --> 07:24:17.100 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts my uh parents were told uh
 
07:24:20.270 --> 07:24:20.280 align:start position:0%
we had to evacuate like leave our home
 
07:24:21.948 --> 07:24:21.958 align:start position:0%
that my dad bought this bunny pit of a
 
07:24:23.570 --> 07:24:23.580 align:start position:0%
Victorian long story short he was
 
07:24:27.048 --> 07:24:27.058 align:start position:0%
sanding he poisoned my brother and we
 
07:24:29.390 --> 07:24:29.400 align:start position:0%
were basically homeless for six months
 
07:24:31.850 --> 07:24:31.860 align:start position:0%
my dad went and got licensed to become a
 
07:24:33.830 --> 07:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
licensed the letter to fix his dream
 
07:24:35.628 --> 07:24:35.638 align:start position:0%
home because it was too expensive for
 
07:24:38.628 --> 07:24:38.638 align:start position:0%
him to take on the cost to remove the
 
07:24:40.310 --> 07:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
lead or hire it out I should say I know
 
07:24:41.208 --> 07:24:41.218 align:start position:0%
that was
 
07:24:44.390 --> 07:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
you know 20 32 years ago now so um
 
07:24:45.890 --> 07:24:45.900 align:start position:0%
hopefully that's not the situation now
 
07:24:49.850 --> 07:24:49.860 align:start position:0%
my concern with this bill is that it
 
07:24:51.170 --> 07:24:51.180 align:start position:0%
um there needs to be clear consequences
 
07:24:53.150 --> 07:24:53.160 align:start position:0%
of what happens when a child tests High
 
07:24:55.548 --> 07:24:55.558 align:start position:0%
I know that in the bill it says if a
 
07:24:57.590 --> 07:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
child has not had a blood level test at
 
07:24:59.510 --> 07:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
the time of admission they shall be
 
07:25:01.670 --> 07:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
granted six months to remedy the
 
07:25:04.788 --> 07:25:04.798 align:start position:0%
deficiency what happens then are there
 
07:25:06.770 --> 07:25:06.780 align:start position:0%
legal ramifications for the parents who
 
07:25:08.930 --> 07:25:08.940 align:start position:0%
don't get the blood test
 
07:25:10.730 --> 07:25:10.740 align:start position:0%
um and then I'm just not a fan of
 
07:25:12.468 --> 07:25:12.478 align:start position:0%
mandates requirements versus
 
07:25:13.968 --> 07:25:13.978 align:start position:0%
recommendations so I just want to make
 
07:25:15.650 --> 07:25:15.660 align:start position:0%
sure that the committee takes into
 
07:25:17.750 --> 07:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
consideration what happens if a child
 
07:25:20.628 --> 07:25:20.638 align:start position:0%
tests High what happens to those parents
 
07:25:22.430 --> 07:25:22.440 align:start position:0%
what happens to that child what are the
 
07:25:22.440 --> 07:25:23.868 align:start position:0%
what happens to that child what are the
expectations

07:25:23.868 --> 07:25:23.878 align:start position:0%
expectations
 
07:25:26.990 --> 07:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:29.990 --> 07:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
being none thank you
 
07:25:32.930 --> 07:25:32.940 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Henry vayu
 
07:25:38.510 --> 07:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:40.850 --> 07:25:40.860 align:start position:0%
good late afternoon uh members of the
 
07:25:40.860 --> 07:25:41.990 align:start position:0%
good late afternoon uh members of the
committee

07:25:41.990 --> 07:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
committee
 
07:25:44.628 --> 07:25:44.638 align:start position:0%
um I'll be very brief Henry vayu on
 
07:25:46.250 --> 07:25:46.260 align:start position:0%
behalf of the New Hampshire Alliance of
 
07:25:50.270 --> 07:25:50.280 align:start position:0%
YMCAs we have child care programs all
 
07:25:53.750 --> 07:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
around the state we are happy to be part
 
07:25:56.930 --> 07:25:56.940 align:start position:0%
of the solution to getting a kids more
 
07:25:59.570 --> 07:25:59.580 align:start position:0%
kids tested but here's the one concern
 
07:26:02.868 --> 07:26:02.878 align:start position:0%
that we have with the approach that the
 
07:26:04.810 --> 07:26:04.820 align:start position:0%
bill is taking
 
07:26:08.868 --> 07:26:08.878 align:start position:0%
so it basically this is the form that
 
07:26:11.330 --> 07:26:11.340 align:start position:0%
needs to be supplied by the parents to
 
07:26:13.730 --> 07:26:13.740 align:start position:0%
enter into the program and it does have
 
07:26:17.510 --> 07:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
a section in here for the results of
 
07:26:18.650 --> 07:26:18.660 align:start position:0%
lead test
 
07:26:22.670 --> 07:26:22.680 align:start position:0%
uh but what this law will do is it says
 
07:26:26.090 --> 07:26:26.100 align:start position:0%
you have uh you have to have the results
 
07:26:29.390 --> 07:26:29.400 align:start position:0%
of the test on the form
 
07:26:31.368 --> 07:26:31.378 align:start position:0%
a supply you know filled out by The
 
07:26:34.670 --> 07:26:34.680 align:start position:0%
Physician and if you don't within six
 
07:26:34.680 --> 07:26:36.530 align:start position:0%
Physician and if you don't within six
months

07:26:36.530 --> 07:26:36.540 align:start position:0%
months
 
07:26:39.048 --> 07:26:39.058 align:start position:0%
um these are well these These are the
 
07:26:40.788 --> 07:26:40.798 align:start position:0%
repercussions um we asked in the
 
07:26:43.368 --> 07:26:43.378 align:start position:0%
department last year when the bill uh
 
07:26:46.548 --> 07:26:46.558 align:start position:0%
was in play and this was the response
 
07:26:49.968 --> 07:26:49.978 align:start position:0%
um should this law pass my initial
 
07:26:52.548 --> 07:26:52.558 align:start position:0%
interpretation is that parents must
 
07:26:55.190 --> 07:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
Supply the testing result and the date
 
07:26:57.830 --> 07:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
of the test or the information that they
 
07:26:59.750 --> 07:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
have opted out of testing
 
07:27:02.510 --> 07:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
should it not be provided initially then
 
07:27:04.730 --> 07:27:04.740 align:start position:0%
parents have six months to provide the
 
07:27:04.740 --> 07:27:05.810 align:start position:0%
parents have six months to provide the
information

07:27:05.810 --> 07:27:05.820 align:start position:0%
information
 
07:27:08.390 --> 07:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
when child care licensing reviews the
 
07:27:12.230 --> 07:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
forms on file with the provider
 
07:27:14.208 --> 07:27:14.218 align:start position:0%
we would review whether or not the
 
07:27:16.968 --> 07:27:16.978 align:start position:0%
programs have the information as we do
 
07:27:21.110 --> 07:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
for immunizations so if the test result
 
07:27:24.890 --> 07:27:24.900 align:start position:0%
is not on here we would cite the program
 
07:27:27.650 --> 07:27:27.660 align:start position:0%
for the missing information and the
 
07:27:29.090 --> 07:27:29.100 align:start position:0%
program would need to provide a
 
07:27:31.368 --> 07:27:31.378 align:start position:0%
corrective action plan that includes the
 
07:27:33.010 --> 07:27:33.020 align:start position:0%
required information
 
07:27:37.190 --> 07:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
so we already know that the testing
 
07:27:40.368 --> 07:27:40.378 align:start position:0%
rates are going down they're the
 
07:27:43.310 --> 07:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
department reported recently that the
 
07:27:45.590 --> 07:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
testing rates have gone down so the
 
07:27:48.170 --> 07:27:48.180 align:start position:0%
providers the the child care providers
 
07:27:50.330 --> 07:27:50.340 align:start position:0%
are not just going to be asking the
 
07:27:53.208 --> 07:27:53.218 align:start position:0%
parents to provide the forms they're
 
07:27:54.288 --> 07:27:54.298 align:start position:0%
basically going to be telling some
 
07:27:56.270 --> 07:27:56.280 align:start position:0%
parents you've got to go get the test
 
07:27:58.910 --> 07:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
and provide the form and I can guarantee
 
07:28:00.830 --> 07:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
you that there are going to be some
 
07:28:02.990 --> 07:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
parents after six months that will not
 
07:28:06.468 --> 07:28:06.478 align:start position:0%
have supplied that and if in the form if
 
07:28:08.868 --> 07:28:08.878 align:start position:0%
in the file of the provider there's
 
07:28:12.048 --> 07:28:12.058 align:start position:0%
either not the result test or something
 
07:28:15.048 --> 07:28:15.058 align:start position:0%
signed by the parent that says they are
 
07:28:17.930 --> 07:28:17.940 align:start position:0%
opting out then the provider the child
 
07:28:20.930 --> 07:28:20.940 align:start position:0%
care provider gets cited and has to so
 
07:28:23.750 --> 07:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
that's the concern that the providers
 
07:28:23.760 --> 07:28:24.610 align:start position:0%
that's the concern that the providers
have

07:28:24.610 --> 07:28:24.620 align:start position:0%
have
 
07:28:28.490 --> 07:28:28.500 align:start position:0%
right now uh working in a Child Care
 
07:28:31.548 --> 07:28:31.558 align:start position:0%
Agency is Pretty Tough there's staffing
 
07:28:34.990 --> 07:28:35.000 align:start position:0%
issues I try to do the best we can
 
07:28:38.150 --> 07:28:38.160 align:start position:0%
and we are happy to be part of the
 
07:28:42.110 --> 07:28:42.120 align:start position:0%
solution it just seems when the primary
 
07:28:44.810 --> 07:28:44.820 align:start position:0%
care physician is filling out the form
 
07:28:46.910 --> 07:28:46.920 align:start position:0%
maybe that's the appropriate time to say
 
07:28:49.610 --> 07:28:49.620 align:start position:0%
you got to get the test done uh the
 
07:28:51.770 --> 07:28:51.780 align:start position:0%
providers don't have all the information
 
07:28:54.708 --> 07:28:54.718 align:start position:0%
about lead testing and we're not
 
07:28:56.330 --> 07:28:56.340 align:start position:0%
Physicians to be able to talk with the
 
07:28:58.368 --> 07:28:58.378 align:start position:0%
parent in the office we're happy to
 
07:29:00.590 --> 07:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
remind them if this is more of an
 
07:29:02.690 --> 07:29:02.700 align:start position:0%
approach you need to remind the parent
 
07:29:04.968 --> 07:29:04.978 align:start position:0%
and we're fine to have them sign the
 
07:29:07.850 --> 07:29:07.860 align:start position:0%
form and that says we've been reminded
 
07:29:10.190 --> 07:29:10.200 align:start position:0%
by the provider the child care provider
 
07:29:12.890 --> 07:29:12.900 align:start position:0%
that we should get this test we're happy
 
07:29:15.410 --> 07:29:15.420 align:start position:0%
with doing that but it just penalizes
 
07:29:18.288 --> 07:29:18.298 align:start position:0%
the provider with this approach by
 
07:29:20.030 --> 07:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
saying if they if the parent doesn't
 
07:29:22.670 --> 07:29:22.680 align:start position:0%
provide the information you get cited so
 
07:29:24.288 --> 07:29:24.298 align:start position:0%
that's that's the problem that we have
 
07:29:26.208 --> 07:29:26.218 align:start position:0%
with the approach that this takes thank
 
07:29:28.128 --> 07:29:28.138 align:start position:0%
you any questions yes representative
 
07:29:30.468 --> 07:29:30.478 align:start position:0%
Nagel thank you for taking or thank you
 
07:29:32.030 --> 07:29:32.040 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thanks for taking my
 
07:29:32.040 --> 07:29:32.810 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thanks for taking my
question

07:29:32.810 --> 07:29:32.820 align:start position:0%
question
 
07:29:35.570 --> 07:29:35.580 align:start position:0%
um is this legislation fixable
 
07:29:38.030 --> 07:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
you know again we are happy to be part
 
07:29:39.948 --> 07:29:39.958 align:start position:0%
of the solution
 
07:29:42.708 --> 07:29:42.718 align:start position:0%
if the proponents have said we just want
 
07:29:44.690 --> 07:29:44.700 align:start position:0%
you to be the reminder and we're happy
 
07:29:47.930 --> 07:29:47.940 align:start position:0%
to be the reminder like I said if if
 
07:29:50.090 --> 07:29:50.100 align:start position:0%
over the course of six months
 
07:29:52.368 --> 07:29:52.378 align:start position:0%
you have them sign the sheet again yes
 
07:29:54.590 --> 07:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
we've been reminded we need to get this
 
07:29:57.048 --> 07:29:57.058 align:start position:0%
done we've been reminded so our our duty
 
07:29:59.448 --> 07:29:59.458 align:start position:0%
will be to remind the parent you got to
 
07:30:01.910 --> 07:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
get this done but don't penalize the
 
07:30:05.628 --> 07:30:05.638 align:start position:0%
provider if the parent doesn't get it in
 
07:30:08.690 --> 07:30:08.700 align:start position:0%
 
07:30:10.850 --> 07:30:10.860 align:start position:0%
saying no other questions okay thank you
 
07:30:13.010 --> 07:30:13.020 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:30:15.170 --> 07:30:15.180 align:start position:0%
and the final person who signed up to
 
07:30:18.530 --> 07:30:18.540 align:start position:0%
speak today and I have the bill down is
 
07:30:21.230 --> 07:30:21.240 align:start position:0%
324 I'm assuming it's for 342. William
 
07:30:26.628 --> 07:30:26.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:30:29.448 --> 07:30:29.458 align:start position:0%
you do you did mean you did mean 342
 
07:30:29.458 --> 07:30:30.708 align:start position:0%
you do you did mean you did mean 342
right

07:30:30.708 --> 07:30:30.718 align:start position:0%
right
 
07:30:33.468 --> 07:30:33.478 align:start position:0%
this one okay yeah
 
07:30:35.510 --> 07:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
my name is William Rogers Winchester
 
07:30:39.230 --> 07:30:39.240 align:start position:0%
again thank you this I can talk a little
 
07:30:42.230 --> 07:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
bit knowledgeably about I held my lead
 
07:30:44.868 --> 07:30:44.878 align:start position:0%
abatement license and asbestos abatement
 
07:30:47.090 --> 07:30:47.100 align:start position:0%
license in the state of Rhode Island for
 
07:30:49.010 --> 07:30:49.020 align:start position:0%
many years I'm since retired of course
 
07:30:52.310 --> 07:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
but um one of the representatives asked
 
07:30:55.128 --> 07:30:55.138 align:start position:0%
about the cost uh and uh
 
07:30:55.138 --> 07:30:57.468 align:start position:0%
about the cost uh and uh
possible

07:30:57.468 --> 07:30:57.478 align:start position:0%
possible
 
07:30:59.448 --> 07:30:59.458 align:start position:0%
cost to landlords I think he was going
 
07:31:03.048 --> 07:31:03.058 align:start position:0%
at fortunately lead mitigation is is not
 
07:31:06.650 --> 07:31:06.660 align:start position:0%
that expensive as the sponsor said most
 
07:31:08.390 --> 07:31:08.400 align:start position:0%
of the lead poisoning comes from the
 
07:31:10.610 --> 07:31:10.620 align:start position:0%
windows where they rub together and go
 
07:31:12.830 --> 07:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
up and down and they continue to rub
 
07:31:16.128 --> 07:31:16.138 align:start position:0%
that's where most of the toxicity comes
 
07:31:19.250 --> 07:31:19.260 align:start position:0%
from some from the Baseline the the drip
 
07:31:21.890 --> 07:31:21.900 align:start position:0%
line outside but simply replacing the
 
07:31:24.890 --> 07:31:24.900 align:start position:0%
windows and painting the inside of the
 
07:31:27.590 --> 07:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
windows the interior wood frame is going
 
07:31:31.070 --> 07:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
to knock out probably 95 percent of the
 
07:31:33.890 --> 07:31:33.900 align:start position:0%
toxins in a home it's the rubbing that
 
07:31:35.810 --> 07:31:35.820 align:start position:0%
does it it's the dust it's not the paint
 
07:31:38.208 --> 07:31:38.218 align:start position:0%
once you cover the lead paint which most
 
07:31:40.430 --> 07:31:40.440 align:start position:0%
of it's been covered so that's not the
 
07:31:42.110 --> 07:31:42.120 align:start position:0%
problem but the windows continue to go
 
07:31:45.590 --> 07:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
up and down so it's not it's not a huge
 
07:31:47.750 --> 07:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
huge process it's not hundreds of
 
07:31:50.570 --> 07:31:50.580 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars to get rid of a
 
07:31:55.010 --> 07:31:55.020 align:start position:0%
lead and keep the child that that if
 
07:31:56.628 --> 07:31:56.638 align:start position:0%
this law passes
 
07:31:59.150 --> 07:31:59.160 align:start position:0%
you'll you'll recognize it and it's not
 
07:32:01.730 --> 07:32:01.740 align:start position:0%
from The Next Step of course would be to
 
07:32:04.190 --> 07:32:04.200 align:start position:0%
mitigate it and it's not that daunting a
 
07:32:06.830 --> 07:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
situation really that's all I wanted to
 
07:32:09.548 --> 07:32:09.558 align:start position:0%
say thank you questions representative
 
07:32:11.990 --> 07:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Mr
 
07:32:14.810 --> 07:32:14.820 align:start position:0%
Rogers so you're saying if I paint paint
 
07:32:18.288 --> 07:32:18.298 align:start position:0%
latex paint over my the wooden parts of
 
07:32:20.270 --> 07:32:20.280 align:start position:0%
my windows that's
 
07:32:23.510 --> 07:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
better than nothing over in particular
 
07:32:25.968 --> 07:32:25.978 align:start position:0%
if you think of your window like think
 
07:32:28.788 --> 07:32:28.798 align:start position:0%
of a typical double Hall window the
 
07:32:31.250 --> 07:32:31.260 align:start position:0%
sashes that go up and down yep every
 
07:32:33.770 --> 07:32:33.780 align:start position:0%
place inside there where they rub up and
 
07:32:36.468 --> 07:32:36.478 align:start position:0%
down and the the wood that's the potting
 
07:32:38.868 --> 07:32:38.878 align:start position:0%
stop that's generally in between those
 
07:32:40.850 --> 07:32:40.860 align:start position:0%
would need to be replaced what I'm
 
07:32:44.570 --> 07:32:44.580 align:start position:0%
saying is if the interior the frame
 
07:32:47.030 --> 07:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
where your curtains hang from and the
 
07:32:49.850 --> 07:32:49.860 align:start position:0%
sill that can be painted over and that
 
07:32:52.490 --> 07:32:52.500 align:start position:0%
encaps encapsulates the lead okay unless
 
07:32:54.590 --> 07:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
you take a hammer to it or a child
 
07:32:56.690 --> 07:32:56.700 align:start position:0%
starts chewing on it that lead is
 
07:32:58.670 --> 07:32:58.680 align:start position:0%
encapsulated and is not going to be a
 
07:33:00.410 --> 07:33:00.420 align:start position:0%
threat to anyone thank you very much of
 
07:33:02.930 --> 07:33:02.940 align:start position:0%
course in the event of a fire or
 
07:33:04.850 --> 07:33:04.860 align:start position:0%
something that would disturb that then
 
07:33:07.610 --> 07:33:07.620 align:start position:0%
the lead could again have a a chance to
 
07:33:10.010 --> 07:33:10.020 align:start position:0%
come out but yeah Mr Rogers
 
07:33:12.410 --> 07:33:12.420 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
07:33:17.868 --> 07:33:17.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:20.330 --> 07:33:20.340 align:start position:0%
could I ask Mr Senator Bland sorry thank
 
07:33:22.490 --> 07:33:22.500 align:start position:0%
you could I ask Mr velu I forgot to ask
 
07:33:24.468 --> 07:33:24.478 align:start position:0%
you to send that letter that you had
 
07:33:25.910 --> 07:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
about what would happen with the child
 
07:33:27.350 --> 07:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
care agencies that would be informative
 
07:33:29.390 --> 07:33:29.400 align:start position:0%
for us thank you very much
 
07:33:31.610 --> 07:33:31.620 align:start position:0%
that's fine I have no one else signed up
 
07:33:34.610 --> 07:33:34.620 align:start position:0%
to testify on House Bill 342 does
 
07:33:36.650 --> 07:33:36.660 align:start position:0%
anybody else wish to
 
07:33:39.110 --> 07:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
but yes
 
07:33:43.730 --> 07:33:43.740 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:43.740 --> 07:33:47.350 align:start position:0%

my name is Danielle warboys I'm a
 
07:33:53.150 --> 07:33:53.160 align:start position:0%
legislative liaison for DHHS okay you
 
07:33:55.310 --> 07:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
have three minutes ma'am okay I work um
 
07:33:57.170 --> 07:33:57.180 align:start position:0%
I work in the child care licensing unit
 
07:33:59.990 --> 07:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
and this um what was cited to earlier is
 
07:34:01.510 --> 07:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
they do have to provide a health
 
07:34:04.730 --> 07:34:04.740 align:start position:0%
assessment form and
 
07:34:06.590 --> 07:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
um it can be in lieu of a physical
 
07:34:09.410 --> 07:34:09.420 align:start position:0%
examination but they can also opt out of
 
07:34:12.110 --> 07:34:12.120 align:start position:0%
this our child care licensing is to keep
 
07:34:15.708 --> 07:34:15.718 align:start position:0%
child children safe it's not to penalize
 
07:34:17.208 --> 07:34:17.218 align:start position:0%
the providers and I just want to make
 
07:34:19.670 --> 07:34:19.680 align:start position:0%
that clarification that there is a form
 
07:34:21.468 --> 07:34:21.478 align:start position:0%
available where they can opt out or they
 
07:34:24.010 --> 07:34:24.020 align:start position:0%
can provide documentation of a physician
 
07:34:26.330 --> 07:34:26.340 align:start position:0%
examination great thank you any
 
07:34:26.340 --> 07:34:27.288 align:start position:0%
examination great thank you any

could give us some information on that
 
07:34:32.448 --> 07:34:32.458 align:start position:0%
process by emailing it to the committee
 
07:34:34.010 --> 07:34:34.020 align:start position:0%

07:34:34.730 --> 07:34:34.740 align:start position:0%
you
 
07:34:36.650 --> 07:34:36.660 align:start position:0%
another questions
 
07:34:38.930 --> 07:34:38.940 align:start position:0%
thank you and please fill out that pink
 
07:34:41.448 --> 07:34:41.458 align:start position:0%
card for us

okay if I no one else wishes to testify
 
07:34:47.690 --> 07:34:47.700 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 342 I am going to close
 
07:34:50.448 --> 07:34:50.458 align:start position:0%

07:34:52.250 --> 07:34:52.260 align:start position:0%

425 and recognize the prime sponsor
 
07:34:58.250 --> 07:34:58.260 align:start position:0%
representative Timothy Horrigan
 
07:34:58.260 --> 07:35:28.810 align:start position:0%
representative Timothy Horrigan
foreign

07:35:28.810 --> 07:35:28.820 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:41.708 --> 07:35:41.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:43.788 --> 07:35:43.798 align:start position:0%
you think after
 
07:35:45.590 --> 07:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
I think after two hours I'd be ready to
 
07:35:47.810 --> 07:35:47.820 align:start position:0%
start instantaneously but but no anyway
 
07:35:50.090 --> 07:35:50.100 align:start position:0%
so I'm president Timothy Horrigan I'm
 
07:35:51.948 --> 07:35:51.958 align:start position:0%
from Trafford County District
 
07:35:54.530 --> 07:35:54.540 align:start position:0%
10 which is the town of Durham
 
07:35:57.830 --> 07:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
and I'm here to introduce HB 425 and
 
07:35:59.150 --> 07:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
it's uh
 
07:36:01.968 --> 07:36:01.978 align:start position:0%
huh doesn't have the most enticing time
 
07:36:03.948 --> 07:36:03.958 align:start position:0%
to repeal the statue relative to Medical
 
07:36:05.930 --> 07:36:05.940 align:start position:0%
freedom and immunizations and of course
 
07:36:05.940 --> 07:36:06.890 align:start position:0%
freedom and immunizations and of course
uh

07:36:06.890 --> 07:36:06.900 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:36:08.570 --> 07:36:08.580 align:start position:0%
I guess not everybody's in favor of
 
07:36:10.910 --> 07:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
immunizations but he wasn't in favor of
 
07:36:14.270 --> 07:36:14.280 align:start position:0%
medical freedom but um
 
07:36:15.948 --> 07:36:15.958 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
07:36:17.990 --> 07:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
and this was uh actually it's a repeat
 
07:36:20.690 --> 07:36:20.700 align:start position:0%
of a bill that was uh introduced in this
 
07:36:22.548 --> 07:36:22.558 align:start position:0%
committee uh last year and there's
 
07:36:23.868 --> 07:36:23.878 align:start position:0%
actually I think this was the one where
 
07:36:25.610 --> 07:36:25.620 align:start position:0%
I had the Music Experience where I had
 
07:36:27.468 --> 07:36:27.478 align:start position:0%
to Sprint all the way from
 
07:36:29.750 --> 07:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
the farthest corner of the lob to reps
 
07:36:31.430 --> 07:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
Hall and I was like severely out of
 
07:36:32.628 --> 07:36:32.638 align:start position:0%
breath by God and I thought it was
 
07:36:35.030 --> 07:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
ironically if I drop dead they would
 
07:36:36.708 --> 07:36:36.718 align:start position:0%
have blamed it on the vaccine or some
 
07:36:38.208 --> 07:36:38.218 align:start position:0%
people would have blamed it on covid but
 
07:36:40.430 --> 07:36:40.440 align:start position:0%
I was fine I caught my breath today I
 
07:36:42.110 --> 07:36:42.120 align:start position:0%
had plenty more a couple hours to rest
 
07:36:42.120 --> 07:36:43.010 align:start position:0%
had plenty more a couple hours to rest
up

07:36:43.010 --> 07:36:43.020 align:start position:0%
up
 
07:36:45.530 --> 07:36:45.540 align:start position:0%
first of all there is no legal natural
 
07:36:47.448 --> 07:36:47.458 align:start position:0%
legal or constitutional right to spread
 
07:36:50.468 --> 07:36:50.478 align:start position:0%
any communical disease especially not a
 
07:36:53.030 --> 07:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
respiratory virus like covid-19 which
 
07:36:57.048 --> 07:36:57.058 align:start position:0%
has killed over 1.14 million Americans
 
07:36:58.968 --> 07:36:58.978 align:start position:0%
a little bit to plant tend to make it
 
07:37:00.890 --> 07:37:00.900 align:start position:0%
slow down a little since I
 
07:37:03.170 --> 07:37:03.180 align:start position:0%
introduced the earlier Bill almost
 
07:37:05.030 --> 07:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
exactly a year ago I think I think maybe
 
07:37:07.310 --> 07:37:07.320 align:start position:0%
it was a year ago to the day when the
 
07:37:09.708 --> 07:37:09.718 align:start position:0%
death toll stood around 900 000. so only
 
07:37:11.448 --> 07:37:11.458 align:start position:0%
a quarter of a million have died in the
 
07:37:13.010 --> 07:37:13.020 align:start position:0%
last 52 weeks
 
07:37:14.810 --> 07:37:14.820 align:start position:0%
but even a quarter of a million is a
 
07:37:16.968 --> 07:37:16.978 align:start position:0%
horrific loss of life this pandemic is
 
07:37:18.830 --> 07:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
the worst catastrophe in U.S history in
 
07:37:20.690 --> 07:37:20.700 align:start position:0%
terms of loss of life even worse than
 
07:37:23.030 --> 07:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
the Civil War and of course that's
 
07:37:25.010 --> 07:37:25.020 align:start position:0%
probably more shocking when you consider
 
07:37:26.868 --> 07:37:26.878 align:start position:0%
that medicine was much better now than
 
07:37:30.048 --> 07:37:30.058 align:start position:0%
it was back then roadway death toll last
 
07:37:32.448 --> 07:37:32.458 align:start position:0%
I checked which is yesterday 6.78
 
07:37:34.610 --> 07:37:34.620 align:start position:0%
million and Counting
 
07:37:36.708 --> 07:37:36.718 align:start position:0%
and I know the vaccines are not 100
 
07:37:39.170 --> 07:37:39.180 align:start position:0%
effective they're not 100 safe but
 
07:37:40.788 --> 07:37:40.798 align:start position:0%
they're very good
 
07:37:42.770 --> 07:37:42.780 align:start position:0%
there's a lot we still don't know about
 
07:37:45.230 --> 07:37:45.240 align:start position:0%
the virus but we do know for sure that
 
07:37:47.150 --> 07:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
it's extraordinarily contagious and it's
 
07:37:48.590 --> 07:37:48.600 align:start position:0%
still dangerous people are still getting
 
07:37:50.570 --> 07:37:50.580 align:start position:0%
sick people some people are still dying
 
07:37:52.850 --> 07:37:52.860 align:start position:0%
we're not
 
07:37:54.468 --> 07:37:54.478 align:start position:0%
um there's some treatments for it but we
 
07:37:56.270 --> 07:37:56.280 align:start position:0%
still haven't found a cure
 
07:37:58.090 --> 07:37:58.100 align:start position:0%
and then uh
 
07:38:01.250 --> 07:38:01.260 align:start position:0%
everything on NPR this morning they're
 
07:38:02.810 --> 07:38:02.820 align:start position:0%
driving down and they've identified a
 
07:38:04.910 --> 07:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
new technology for debt for identifying
 
07:38:06.708 --> 07:38:06.718 align:start position:0%
respiratory viruses unfortunately now
 
07:38:08.270 --> 07:38:08.280 align:start position:0%
they're going to be finding
 
07:38:10.968 --> 07:38:10.978 align:start position:0%
a lot more of them because they're
 
07:38:12.650 --> 07:38:12.660 align:start position:0%
actually like checking
 
07:38:14.510 --> 07:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
uh they're not taking samples from
 
07:38:16.070 --> 07:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
humans who are actually sick rather than
 
07:38:18.948 --> 07:38:18.958 align:start position:0%
taking animal samples and uh then trying
 
07:38:20.448 --> 07:38:20.458 align:start position:0%
to see if they're replicated in humans
 
07:38:22.968 --> 07:38:22.978 align:start position:0%
but that's uh
 
07:38:25.070 --> 07:38:25.080 align:start position:0%
and I represent Durham as I said that's
 
07:38:27.170 --> 07:38:27.180 align:start position:0%
the whole of unh and UNH took a very
 
07:38:28.788 --> 07:38:28.798 align:start position:0%
aggressive approach to fighting the
 
07:38:30.650 --> 07:38:30.660 align:start position:0%
pandemic beginning with masking up and
 
07:38:32.448 --> 07:38:32.458 align:start position:0%
social distancing and continuing with
 
07:38:35.750 --> 07:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
testing for the virus and I guess
 
07:38:37.788 --> 07:38:37.798 align:start position:0%
another factor in Durham too although
 
07:38:40.250 --> 07:38:40.260 align:start position:0%
there's a lot fewer of them now due to
 
07:38:41.690 --> 07:38:41.700 align:start position:0%
the political events that have
 
07:38:43.070 --> 07:38:43.080 align:start position:0%
transpired since then but they had a
 
07:38:44.990 --> 07:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
large number of Chinese exchange
 
07:38:46.968 --> 07:38:46.978 align:start position:0%
students especially grad students and so
 
07:38:46.978 --> 07:38:47.930 align:start position:0%
students especially grad students and so
the

07:38:47.930 --> 07:38:47.940 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:38:51.288 --> 07:38:51.298 align:start position:0%
Chinese students at UNH being probably
 
07:38:53.448 --> 07:38:53.458 align:start position:0%
smarter than the average person
 
07:38:55.430 --> 07:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
um and of course being in touch with
 
07:38:57.890 --> 07:38:57.900 align:start position:0%
their family and friends back home and
 
07:39:00.650 --> 07:39:00.660 align:start position:0%
do new Nuvo was up with that pandemic
 
07:39:03.708 --> 07:39:03.718 align:start position:0%
maybe before before uh we did those of
 
07:39:05.750 --> 07:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
us who have to rely on uh you know the
 
07:39:07.730 --> 07:39:07.740 align:start position:0%
U.S media
 
07:39:10.430 --> 07:39:10.440 align:start position:0%
anyway and um anyway they're very
 
07:39:12.468 --> 07:39:12.478 align:start position:0%
aggressive in dealing with the virus
 
07:39:14.090 --> 07:39:14.100 align:start position:0%
um and rightly so they're a close-knit
 
07:39:16.310 --> 07:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
community when the coveted vaccines
 
07:39:18.230 --> 07:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
became available which was exactly two
 
07:39:21.230 --> 07:39:21.240 align:start position:0%
years ago UNH did everything in its
 
07:39:22.310 --> 07:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
power to
 
07:39:24.350 --> 07:39:24.360 align:start position:0%
to get make sure everybody in the
 
07:39:25.968 --> 07:39:25.978 align:start position:0%
student body as well as the faculty
 
07:39:29.150 --> 07:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
staff got immunized and uh Phoenix's
 
07:39:30.830 --> 07:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
private school it could have enacted a
 
07:39:32.570 --> 07:39:32.580 align:start position:0%
rule acquiring everyone in campus who
 
07:39:34.730 --> 07:39:34.740 align:start position:0%
can be vaccinated um not everybody can
 
07:39:37.070 --> 07:39:37.080 align:start position:0%
be but the vast majority of people can
 
07:39:38.330 --> 07:39:38.340 align:start position:0%
be vaccinated
 
07:39:41.810 --> 07:39:41.820 align:start position:0%
to get vaccinated ever since UNH was a
 
07:39:43.730 --> 07:39:43.740 align:start position:0%
public institution uh
 
07:39:47.810 --> 07:39:47.820 align:start position:0%
RSA 141 c1a the so-called uh medical
 
07:39:49.788 --> 07:39:49.798 align:start position:0%
freedom and immunization act which I
 
07:39:51.708 --> 07:39:51.718 align:start position:0%
have to admit is a very nice title so
 
07:39:54.590 --> 07:39:54.600 align:start position:0%
whoever wrote that was pretty smart
 
07:39:56.448 --> 07:39:56.458 align:start position:0%
um anyway UNH was forbidden from taking
 
07:39:58.010 --> 07:39:58.020 align:start position:0%
that step and that makes no sense to me
 
07:39:59.750 --> 07:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
even though I agree that was a snazzy
 
07:40:02.150 --> 07:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
title the law account
 
07:40:04.368 --> 07:40:04.378 align:start position:0%
and the public our public College
 
07:40:06.468 --> 07:40:06.478 align:start position:0%
University the same responsibilities any
 
07:40:08.150 --> 07:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
other institution educational or
 
07:40:09.948 --> 07:40:09.958 align:start position:0%
otherwise public or private from
 
07:40:13.330 --> 07:40:13.340 align:start position:0%
protecting their uh people from covid-19
 
07:40:15.530 --> 07:40:15.540 align:start position:0%
so I believe they should have the right
 
07:40:17.330 --> 07:40:17.340 align:start position:0%
to require vaccination is if that's
 
07:40:20.208 --> 07:40:20.218 align:start position:0%
what's needed and um that also applies
 
07:40:23.030 --> 07:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
to a non-educational government
 
07:40:26.090 --> 07:40:26.100 align:start position:0%
institutions as well so uh
 
07:40:28.010 --> 07:40:28.020 align:start position:0%
so I urge you to uh
 
07:40:32.510 --> 07:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
I urge you to uh repeal this unwise law
 
07:40:35.628 --> 07:40:35.638 align:start position:0%
by passing HB 425 and if maybe he's an
 
07:40:37.490 --> 07:40:37.500 align:start position:0%
offense too I might notice the even
 
07:40:39.110 --> 07:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
though the pandemic is still raging
 
07:40:40.788 --> 07:40:40.798 align:start position:0%
we'll probably have more pandemics the
 
07:40:43.430 --> 07:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
our awareness of this one seems to faded
 
07:40:44.930 --> 07:40:44.940 align:start position:0%
a little bit so it's not quite the
 
07:40:46.788 --> 07:40:46.798 align:start position:0%
Forefront of people's things thank you
 
07:40:50.390 --> 07:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
07:40:52.548 --> 07:40:52.558 align:start position:0%
yeah representative Leon
 
07:40:53.930 --> 07:40:53.940 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
07:40:53.940 --> 07:40:55.548 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman and thank you
representative

07:40:55.548 --> 07:40:55.558 align:start position:0%
representative
 
07:40:57.590 --> 07:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
um I I guess first this this is only
 
07:41:00.708 --> 07:41:00.718 align:start position:0%
about covid-19 I believe right well uh
 
07:41:02.690 --> 07:41:02.700 align:start position:0%
and that's what the statute is I mean
 
07:41:04.010 --> 07:41:04.020 align:start position:0%
there's something important I forgot to
 
07:41:05.570 --> 07:41:05.580 align:start position:0%
bring to me what the bill says or faster
 
07:41:08.270 --> 07:41:08.280 align:start position:0%
into covid-19 pandemic but I think it
 
07:41:10.850 --> 07:41:10.860 align:start position:0%
was more General than that that's sorry
 
07:41:12.410 --> 07:41:12.420 align:start position:0%
someone probably
 
07:41:15.410 --> 07:41:15.420 align:start position:0%
I can pull it up on my on my device if
 
07:41:17.868 --> 07:41:17.878 align:start position:0%
you want to okay yeah the statute you're
 
07:41:19.850 --> 07:41:19.860 align:start position:0%
referring to is only the covid-19
 
07:41:23.150 --> 07:41:23.160 align:start position:0%
vaccination so my question was does the
 
07:41:25.190 --> 07:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccination prevent
 
07:41:28.368 --> 07:41:28.378 align:start position:0%
transmission so is this a matter where
 
07:41:29.990 --> 07:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
somebody who's vaccinated could still
 
07:41:32.810 --> 07:41:32.820 align:start position:0%
spreads covid-19 to somebody else well I
 
07:41:35.330 --> 07:41:35.340 align:start position:0%
was I was vaccinated and I
 
07:41:37.788 --> 07:41:37.798 align:start position:0%
in fact I was vaccinated and multiply
 
07:41:40.010 --> 07:41:40.020 align:start position:0%
boosted and I caught covet I know other
 
07:41:42.590 --> 07:41:42.600 align:start position:0%
people who did I don't know if I pass it
 
07:41:44.270 --> 07:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
on to anyone else but you know as I said
 
07:41:46.968 --> 07:41:46.978 align:start position:0%
the vaccine is not 100 effective but uh
 
07:41:46.978 --> 07:41:48.230 align:start position:0%
the vaccine is not 100 effective but uh
it's

07:41:48.230 --> 07:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
it's
 
07:41:50.330 --> 07:41:50.340 align:start position:0%
a lot better than just doing nothing
 
07:41:51.830 --> 07:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
which is what some people would have
 
07:41:54.468 --> 07:41:54.478 align:start position:0%
wanted us to do that didn't work very
 
07:41:57.230 --> 07:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
well where it was tried you know then
 
07:42:00.048 --> 07:42:00.058 align:start position:0%
I mean there there may be I mean some
 
07:42:01.490 --> 07:42:01.500 align:start position:0%
countries may have gone to Extremes in
 
07:42:03.650 --> 07:42:03.660 align:start position:0%
the other direction but uh yeah so it
 
07:42:05.270 --> 07:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
was it was a very dangerous vaccine
 
07:42:09.350 --> 07:42:09.360 align:start position:0%
still around and possibly uh and was
 
07:42:11.690 --> 07:42:11.700 align:start position:0%
very much for that one and of course it
 
07:42:13.190 --> 07:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
was for that if I believe it was for the
 
07:42:15.048 --> 07:42:15.058 align:start position:0%
one vaccine that makes sense because it
 
07:42:17.750 --> 07:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
was a new vaccine the actual all else it
 
07:42:18.708 --> 07:42:18.718 align:start position:0%
came along when there's a lot of
 
07:42:20.690 --> 07:42:20.700 align:start position:0%
distrust and
 
07:42:22.788 --> 07:42:22.798 align:start position:0%
both governmental and other institutions
 
07:42:24.230 --> 07:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
and this was something very new they
 
07:42:25.490 --> 07:42:25.500 align:start position:0%
came along to people didn't understand
 
07:42:28.010 --> 07:42:28.020 align:start position:0%
and the vaccines uh
 
07:42:29.868 --> 07:42:29.878 align:start position:0%
vaccines I think they were tested very
 
07:42:32.390 --> 07:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
thoroughly um I think they were but they
 
07:42:35.448 --> 07:42:35.458 align:start position:0%
were tested rather quickly I think there
 
07:42:37.788 --> 07:42:37.798 align:start position:0%
were some I think you could say I think
 
07:42:38.750 --> 07:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
it's because there were some similar
 
07:42:40.730 --> 07:42:40.740 align:start position:0%
diseases they're already working on but
 
07:42:43.070 --> 07:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
also they put aside a lot of the
 
07:42:45.830 --> 07:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical providers put aside a lot
 
07:42:47.448 --> 07:42:47.458 align:start position:0%
of other projects that develop you know
 
07:42:49.730 --> 07:42:49.740 align:start position:0%
do sort of like a moon shot or crash
 
07:42:51.468 --> 07:42:51.478 align:start position:0%
course or whatever program to develop
 
07:42:54.048 --> 07:42:54.058 align:start position:0%
the coveted vaccine and it was a
 
07:42:56.628 --> 07:42:56.638 align:start position:0%
my mind was remarkably successful I know
 
07:42:58.968 --> 07:42:58.978 align:start position:0%
not everybody agrees and you know thank
 
07:43:01.310 --> 07:43:01.320 align:start position:0%
you nothing's ever 100 effective and of
 
07:43:02.270 --> 07:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
course you're always going to have
 
07:43:03.948 --> 07:43:03.958 align:start position:0%
unexplained deaths and right now there's
 
07:43:05.570 --> 07:43:05.580 align:start position:0%
some people blame every unexplained
 
07:43:07.310 --> 07:43:07.320 align:start position:0%
deaths that's happened since the last
 
07:43:08.990 --> 07:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
two years on the vaccine which thank you
 
07:43:10.670 --> 07:43:10.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Hogan any other
 
07:43:10.680 --> 07:43:11.990 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Hogan any other
questions

07:43:11.990 --> 07:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
questions
 
07:43:14.448 --> 07:43:14.458 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro
 
07:43:17.448 --> 07:43:17.458 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman my my memory
 
07:43:19.010 --> 07:43:19.020 align:start position:0%
of the bill was that there was some kind
 
07:43:20.628 --> 07:43:20.638 align:start position:0%
of ruling that it only applied to
 
07:43:23.570 --> 07:43:23.580 align:start position:0%
covid-19 at one point after the bill was
 
07:43:27.048 --> 07:43:27.058 align:start position:0%
passed so my question is that
 
07:43:30.890 --> 07:43:30.900 align:start position:0%
since the illness has evolved the
 
07:43:35.170 --> 07:43:35.180 align:start position:0%
treatments have evolved time has passed
 
07:43:38.448 --> 07:43:38.458 align:start position:0%
if we repeal this bill which was I was
 
07:43:41.288 --> 07:43:41.298 align:start position:0%
dead set against when we passed it
 
07:43:43.850 --> 07:43:43.860 align:start position:0%
if we repealed it
 
07:43:46.850 --> 07:43:46.860 align:start position:0%
concretely what would be different now
 
07:43:50.750 --> 07:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
than if we didn't repeal it well we it
 
07:43:52.788 --> 07:43:52.798 align:start position:0%
still hasn't uh still hasn't gone away
 
07:43:54.468 --> 07:43:54.478 align:start position:0%
it's still peaking
 
07:43:57.170 --> 07:43:57.180 align:start position:0%
peeking in some places at a big
 
07:43:57.180 --> 07:43:58.730 align:start position:0%
peeking in some places at a big
China

07:43:58.730 --> 07:43:58.740 align:start position:0%
China
 
07:44:01.850 --> 07:44:01.860 align:start position:0%
yeah China took a very much more
 
07:44:03.830 --> 07:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
aggressive they took probably was an
 
07:44:05.150 --> 07:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
unworkable approach although they did
 
07:44:06.590 --> 07:44:06.600 align:start position:0%
manage to keep it going for about two
 
07:44:08.090 --> 07:44:08.100 align:start position:0%
years and then they kind of went in the
 
07:44:09.230 --> 07:44:09.240 align:start position:0%
opposite direction and they're having
 
07:44:11.390 --> 07:44:11.400 align:start position:0%
like a lot of spread at the moment but
 
07:44:14.570 --> 07:44:14.580 align:start position:0%
and it might even though viruses
 
07:44:17.570 --> 07:44:17.580 align:start position:0%
uh viruses tend to become uh well
 
07:44:19.430 --> 07:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
viruses do to him a little bit more like
 
07:44:20.750 --> 07:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
we might call virulent over the time
 
07:44:22.368 --> 07:44:22.378 align:start position:0%
because killing the host is usually a
 
07:44:24.350 --> 07:44:24.360 align:start position:0%
really bad strategy for the virus you
 
07:44:25.968 --> 07:44:25.978 align:start position:0%
know but also um
 
07:44:28.250 --> 07:44:28.260 align:start position:0%
and also I think we could still get a
 
07:44:30.530 --> 07:44:30.540 align:start position:0%
dangerous uh dangerous outbreak and
 
07:44:32.208 --> 07:44:32.218 align:start position:0%
people are still getting sick and even
 
07:44:34.910 --> 07:44:34.920 align:start position:0%
dying you know there's uh we even had
 
07:44:36.830 --> 07:44:36.840 align:start position:0%
members of this legislature have lost
 
07:44:38.930 --> 07:44:38.940 align:start position:0%
time from work because they're they
 
07:44:40.610 --> 07:44:40.620 align:start position:0%
caught covet
 
07:44:44.330 --> 07:44:44.340 align:start position:0%
 
07:44:54.250 --> 07:44:54.260 align:start position:0%
 
07:44:56.868 --> 07:44:56.878 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
07:44:56.878 --> 07:44:58.310 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
question

07:44:58.310 --> 07:44:58.320 align:start position:0%
question
 
07:45:01.368 --> 07:45:01.378 align:start position:0%
um in the um
 
07:45:03.070 --> 07:45:03.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much in the statute
 
07:45:05.690 --> 07:45:05.700 align:start position:0%
actually there was there were there's a
 
07:45:08.270 --> 07:45:08.280 align:start position:0%
schedule of fines for violating uh the
 
07:45:10.788 --> 07:45:10.798 align:start position:0%
statute in place do you know if there
 
07:45:12.650 --> 07:45:12.660 align:start position:0%
were any violations that were recorded
 
07:45:14.690 --> 07:45:14.700 align:start position:0%
during since that was implemented why
 
07:45:16.850 --> 07:45:16.860 align:start position:0%
would I I would I would hope not I mean
 
07:45:16.860 --> 07:45:17.628 align:start position:0%
would I I would I would hope not I mean
I'm

07:45:17.628 --> 07:45:17.638 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
07:45:21.048 --> 07:45:21.058 align:start position:0%
I've always I've never criminalizing any
 
07:45:23.628 --> 07:45:23.638 align:start position:0%
uh medical procedures almost always a
 
07:45:26.150 --> 07:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
bad idea I think I I do not know of
 
07:45:28.250 --> 07:45:28.260 align:start position:0%
anybody anybody was actually prosecuted
 
07:45:30.230 --> 07:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
or fined as a result of that but that
 
07:45:31.730 --> 07:45:31.740 align:start position:0%
would that was certainly not a good
 
07:45:33.110 --> 07:45:33.120 align:start position:0%
feature of the bill
 
07:45:36.890 --> 07:45:36.900 align:start position:0%
 
07:45:38.930 --> 07:45:38.940 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions okay great
 
07:45:47.690 --> 07:45:47.700 align:start position:0%
 
07:45:49.850 --> 07:45:49.860 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is former
 
07:45:51.468 --> 07:45:51.478 align:start position:0%
representative Melissa blasik for
 
07:46:00.948 --> 07:46:00.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:46:02.868 --> 07:46:02.878 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
07:46:04.968 --> 07:46:04.978 align:start position:0%
committee yes Melissa blasik from
 
07:46:07.850 --> 07:46:07.860 align:start position:0%
Merrimack I'm here representing rebuild
 
07:46:09.530 --> 07:46:09.540 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and we are opposing this
 
07:46:12.288 --> 07:46:12.298 align:start position:0%
bill I will keep it very short and it's
 
07:46:13.968 --> 07:46:13.978 align:start position:0%
been a long day
 
07:46:16.788 --> 07:46:16.798 align:start position:0%
um when this law unanimously passed this
 
07:46:19.010 --> 07:46:19.020 align:start position:0%
committee on the consent calendar two
 
07:46:21.350 --> 07:46:21.360 align:start position:0%
years ago it actually applied to every
 
07:46:23.750 --> 07:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
vaccine but it was reduced to only
 
07:46:26.090 --> 07:46:26.100 align:start position:0%
applying to the covid-19 vaccine in the
 
07:46:26.100 --> 07:46:27.830 align:start position:0%
applying to the covid-19 vaccine in the
Senate

07:46:27.830 --> 07:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
07:46:30.830 --> 07:46:30.840 align:start position:0%
um I'm struggling to find any valid
 
07:46:34.430 --> 07:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
reason for repealing this law it's
 
07:46:36.708 --> 07:46:36.718 align:start position:0%
simply a proactive protection of the
 
07:46:39.110 --> 07:46:39.120 align:start position:0%
right to bodily autonomy and in fact the
 
07:46:42.830 --> 07:46:42.840 align:start position:0%
only policy that I know of that was
 
07:46:45.230 --> 07:46:45.240 align:start position:0%
prevented to be enacted because of this
 
07:46:48.048 --> 07:46:48.058 align:start position:0%
law was the coveted vaccine mandates in
 
07:46:51.350 --> 07:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
public universities and
 
07:46:55.788 --> 07:46:55.798 align:start position:0%
as a result of that lack of mandate
 
07:46:58.070 --> 07:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely nothing bad happened so there
 
07:46:59.090 --> 07:46:59.100 align:start position:0%
you go
 
07:47:01.490 --> 07:47:01.500 align:start position:0%
um I please vote to itl this Bill thank
 
07:47:01.500 --> 07:47:02.330 align:start position:0%
um I please vote to itl this Bill thank
you

07:47:02.330 --> 07:47:02.340 align:start position:0%
you
 
07:47:05.270 --> 07:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions for Mrs boys I
 
07:47:07.070 --> 07:47:07.080 align:start position:0%
guess representative Palazzo
 
07:47:09.468 --> 07:47:09.478 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
07:47:11.770 --> 07:47:11.780 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
07:47:15.110 --> 07:47:15.120 align:start position:0%
is previous speakers that we had to do
 
07:47:18.230 --> 07:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
something that's why we needed this
 
07:47:21.350 --> 07:47:21.360 align:start position:0%
vaccine that doesn't effectively
 
07:47:24.650 --> 07:47:24.660 align:start position:0%
stop the transmission or would you
 
07:47:29.150 --> 07:47:29.160 align:start position:0%
rather agree that there was a need for
 
07:47:32.090 --> 07:47:32.100 align:start position:0%
now or unhealthy push for emergency use
 
07:47:35.570 --> 07:47:35.580 align:start position:0%
socialization so some other alternative
 
07:47:38.150 --> 07:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
treatments will actually pushed aside
 
07:47:42.350 --> 07:47:42.360 align:start position:0%
and not allowed to be developed because
 
07:47:45.110 --> 07:47:45.120 align:start position:0%
to get emergency use socialization my
 
07:47:49.010 --> 07:47:49.020 align:start position:0%
understanding is it has to be the only
 
07:47:53.750 --> 07:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
treatment right available so yes for a
 
07:47:54.948 --> 07:47:54.958 align:start position:0%
vaccine to get emergency use
 
07:47:57.468 --> 07:47:57.478 align:start position:0%
authorization there cannot be any known
 
07:48:00.530 --> 07:48:00.540 align:start position:0%
treatment for the disease that's the
 
07:48:02.090 --> 07:48:02.100 align:start position:0%
Benchmark for emergency use
 
07:48:05.090 --> 07:48:05.100 align:start position:0%
authorization so it yes that's a
 
07:48:07.610 --> 07:48:07.620 align:start position:0%
possibility that perhaps treatments were
 
07:48:10.070 --> 07:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
not developed because we were pushing
 
07:48:13.368 --> 07:48:13.378 align:start position:0%
for a vaccine to have eua I would also
 
07:48:15.230 --> 07:48:15.240 align:start position:0%
add that
 
07:48:18.410 --> 07:48:18.420 align:start position:0%
um the covid vaccines were never tested
 
07:48:20.628 --> 07:48:20.638 align:start position:0%
originally in the primary endpoint of
 
07:48:22.548 --> 07:48:22.558 align:start position:0%
the original trial was not transmission
 
07:48:24.788 --> 07:48:24.798 align:start position:0%
so when
 
07:48:27.350 --> 07:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
other Representatives say that you know
 
07:48:30.468 --> 07:48:30.478 align:start position:0%
we have to have mandates I mean I never
 
07:48:32.390 --> 07:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
believe in a vaccine mandate because I
 
07:48:33.830 --> 07:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
believe in the right to bodily autonomy
 
07:48:36.948 --> 07:48:36.958 align:start position:0%
but hypothetically if you were going to
 
07:48:39.288 --> 07:48:39.298 align:start position:0%
justify one it would have to be because
 
07:48:41.090 --> 07:48:41.100 align:start position:0%
there's a community benefit of stopping
 
07:48:44.150 --> 07:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
transmission we actually never even knew
 
07:48:45.830 --> 07:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
that that was the case to begin with
 
07:48:47.628 --> 07:48:47.638 align:start position:0%
because the primary endpoint of the
 
07:48:49.670 --> 07:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
original study was
 
07:48:51.468 --> 07:48:51.478 align:start position:0%
um symptomatic infection not
 
07:48:51.478 --> 07:48:53.990 align:start position:0%
um symptomatic infection not
transmission

07:48:53.990 --> 07:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:48:56.330 --> 07:48:56.340 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
07:48:58.128 --> 07:48:58.138 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions thank you
 
07:49:02.030 --> 07:49:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:49:04.330 --> 07:49:04.340 align:start position:0%

hey

07:49:36.888 --> 07:49:36.898 align:start position:0%
hey
 
07:49:40.670 --> 07:49:40.680 align:start position:0%
I'm William Rogers from Winchester
 
07:49:40.680 --> 07:49:41.570 align:start position:0%
I'm William Rogers from Winchester
um

07:49:41.570 --> 07:49:41.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:49:44.150 --> 07:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
the president himself has said that the
 
07:49:46.250 --> 07:49:46.260 align:start position:0%
pandemic is over
 
07:49:50.270 --> 07:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
his own words and a a national
 
07:49:53.510 --> 07:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
to all of us he said it's over
 
07:49:55.010 --> 07:49:55.020 align:start position:0%
um what's not over
 
07:49:57.948 --> 07:49:57.958 align:start position:0%
is that there are still questions about
 
07:50:00.590 --> 07:50:00.600 align:start position:0%
what happened during the pandemic about
 
07:50:03.770 --> 07:50:03.780 align:start position:0%
government overreaches things that have
 
07:50:07.430 --> 07:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
been done wrong so much so that that we
 
07:50:09.650 --> 07:50:09.660 align:start position:0%
know that there's been calls for amnesty
 
07:50:12.530 --> 07:50:12.540 align:start position:0%
for things to be done to repeal this
 
07:50:16.548 --> 07:50:16.558 align:start position:0%
bill does no good it's it's it's it's
 
07:50:20.150 --> 07:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
just ludicrous that's all we know
 
07:50:21.830 --> 07:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
there's more questions now than there's
 
07:50:24.350 --> 07:50:24.360 align:start position:0%
ever been we know that more stuff
 
07:50:26.330 --> 07:50:26.340 align:start position:0%
happened this shouldn't have happened
 
07:50:29.570 --> 07:50:29.580 align:start position:0%
and I do take offense to the saying that
 
07:50:32.868 --> 07:50:32.878 align:start position:0%
nobody has the right to a force of
 
07:50:34.548 --> 07:50:34.558 align:start position:0%
communicable disease or spread a
 
07:50:37.850 --> 07:50:37.860 align:start position:0%
communical disease on anybody else but
 
07:50:40.310 --> 07:50:40.320 align:start position:0%
that's never what this was about
 
07:50:41.868 --> 07:50:41.878 align:start position:0%
um they they had admitted from the very
 
07:50:44.388 --> 07:50:44.398 align:start position:0%
first that it wasn't about stopping
 
07:50:46.730 --> 07:50:46.740 align:start position:0%
transmission so so that's an insult to
 
07:50:50.270 --> 07:50:50.280 align:start position:0%
anybody who ever opposed this vaccine or
 
07:50:53.270 --> 07:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
whoever opposed any of the stuff the
 
07:50:55.368 --> 07:50:55.378 align:start position:0%
government has done which is now coming
 
07:50:58.190 --> 07:50:58.200 align:start position:0%
out that there was a lot of malfeasance
 
07:51:00.770 --> 07:51:00.780 align:start position:0%
done very high places in this government
 
07:51:03.530 --> 07:51:03.540 align:start position:0%
thank you very much not this government
 
07:51:07.128 --> 07:51:07.138 align:start position:0%
that government okay thank you sir
 
07:51:09.230 --> 07:51:09.240 align:start position:0%
I have no one else signed up to testify
 
07:51:11.510 --> 07:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
does anyone else wish to testify on
 
07:51:15.350 --> 07:51:15.360 align:start position:0%
House Bill 425 seeing no one I'm going
 
07:51:16.610 --> 07:51:16.620 align:start position:0%
to close the public hearing on House
 
07:51:19.490 --> 07:51:19.500 align:start position:0%

07:51:21.888 --> 07:51:21.898 align:start position:0%
had noticed for hearings today we are
