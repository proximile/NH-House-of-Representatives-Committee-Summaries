00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.390 align:start position:0%
item is to review the minutes the
previous

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 align:start position:0%
previous
 
00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 align:start position:0%

or
 
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
comments seeing none those in favor I
 
00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
much so our
 
00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 align:start position:0%
next item is to review the Actuarial
 
00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:20.149 align:start position:0%
 
comfortable

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 align:start position:0%
does everyone on the commission have a
 
00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:23.319 align:start position:0%
copy went about in the mail this email
 
00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:28.670 align:start position:0%
copy went about in the mail this email
this

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:34.350 align:start position:0%
 
morning

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
morning okay there I believe there's
 
00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:07.910 align:start position:0%
 
thank

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
okay uh thank you madam chair um for the
 
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 align:start position:0%
record Marty Carlin with the New
 
00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement system three of the
 
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 align:start position:0%
grid uh that you should all be familiar
 
00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 align:start position:0%
with by now uh the two two rows
 
00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:22.479 align:start position:0%
highlighted in Gray at the top of the
 
00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 align:start position:0%
page and just as a
 
00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:27.199 align:start position:0%
refresher what this does is it takes a
 
00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
previous proposal that was analyzed that
 
00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 align:start position:0%
called for uh the multiplier for all
 
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 align:start position:0%
group two members in tier B and tier c
 
00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 align:start position:0%
as well as future hires to uh change to
 
00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
a 2.5% multiplier for every year worked
 
00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 align:start position:0%
after attainment of 20 years so last
 
00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
week the commission asked if GRS could
 
00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:51.039 align:start position:0%
turn around uh analysis with that two
 
00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 align:start position:0%
and a half multiplier kicking in at 15
 
00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
years of service after completing 15
 
00:04:58.189 --> 00:04:58.199 align:start position:0%
years and after 10 years so those are
 
00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 align:start position:0%
the two um proposals at the top of the
 
00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 align:start position:0%
page um you know there's an unfunded
 
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 align:start position:0%
liability uh component to both and they
 
00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
um you know obviously the 10 year is is
 
00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 align:start position:0%
larger than the um uh 15-year and then
 
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 align:start position:0%
in column three it shows uh first at the
 
00:05:19.749 --> 00:05:19.759 align:start position:0%
top of that column the rate
 
00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 align:start position:0%
increase um over you know in addition to
 
00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:26.479 align:start position:0%
the current rates um with no prefunding
 
00:05:28.309 --> 00:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
by the state for the unfunded or
 
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
anything else um would raise the um
 
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 align:start position:0%
percentages by about 1.35 to 1.4% of pay
 
00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 align:start position:0%
uh on the employer rates um with uh pre
 
00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.440 align:start position:0%
prefunding an appropriation from the
 
00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:46.199 align:start position:0%
state for the unfunded liability uh the
 
00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600 align:start position:0%
the second set of numbers there uh 0 6
 
00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:50.919 align:start position:0%
and 63 would be the percentage increase
 
00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:53.759 align:start position:0%
which is about 3.3 million a year spread
 
00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560 align:start position:0%
out across the employers proportionately
 
00:05:58.749 --> 00:05:58.759 align:start position:0%
based on the size of their uh Public
 
00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 align:start position:0%
Safety payroll Ro um similarly in the
 
00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:03.759 align:start position:0%
next column uh which is the 10-year it
 
00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:08.360 align:start position:0%
shows a higher unfunded um a higher
 
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
um membership uh member uh employer rate
 
00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:14.199 align:start position:0%
increase um you know and with and
 
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
without unfunded liability so those are
 
00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:18.680 align:start position:0%
those are basically how those proposals
 
00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.120 align:start position:0%
would lay out and again this would
 
00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:23.080 align:start position:0%
impact not only group two tier B
 
00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:28.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
hires thank you so if I understand you
 
00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:35.960 align:start position:0%
correctly it would be 44 million in
 
00:06:38.589 --> 00:06:38.599 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 26
 
00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:43.199 align:start position:0%
to um deal with the current employees or
 
00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:45.919 align:start position:0%
54 million to deal with the the current
 
00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.080 align:start position:0%
employees plus all future hires is that
 
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
correct yeah you're talking about the
 
00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
SEC second row The 10e Proposal yeah
 
00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
yeah so so the unfunded if if that was
 
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
appropriated uh you know by from the
 
00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
state the increase to employer rates for
 
00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
the ongoing future costs of this change
 
00:07:12.749 --> 00:07:12.759 align:start position:0%
would be um 0.95 or 0 94% of pay um now
 
00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
would increase beginning in fiscal year
 
00:07:18.869 --> 00:07:18.879 align:start position:0%
26 the contribution rates uh collected
 
00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:20.680 align:start position:0%
from participating employers of group
 
00:07:23.469 --> 00:07:23.479 align:start position:0%
two people by 5.1 million a
 
00:07:25.469 --> 00:07:25.479 align:start position:0%
year and that that's that's not a
 
00:07:27.749 --> 00:07:27.759 align:start position:0%
one-year cost that's you know because
 
00:07:29.589 --> 00:07:29.599 align:start position:0%
this is an open-ended everybody who's
 
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:31.080 align:start position:0%
coming into the system there there will
 
00:07:33.869 --> 00:07:33.879 align:start position:0%
be a normal cost associated with it
 
00:07:36.749 --> 00:07:36.759 align:start position:0%
going forward that could moderate over
 
00:07:39.029 --> 00:07:39.039 align:start position:0%
time based on other demographic changes
 
00:07:42.749 --> 00:07:42.759 align:start position:0%
but this one you can't pay in advance on
 
00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:43.720 align:start position:0%
because it's
 
00:07:46.189 --> 00:07:46.199 align:start position:0%
open-ended okay thank you very much does
 
00:07:49.029 --> 00:07:49.039 align:start position:0%
anyone have a question Senator
 
00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:53.240 align:start position:0%
Susi but that could be mitigated by the
 
00:07:56.149 --> 00:07:56.159 align:start position:0%
ongoing reduction of rates as we pay off
 
00:07:58.749 --> 00:07:58.759 align:start position:0%
the unfunded liability correct yeah yeah
 
00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
so it mean the rates could even out even
 
00:08:04.589 --> 00:08:04.599 align:start position:0%
with yeah the you know the the the rates
 
00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:07.280 align:start position:0%
change every two years um you know the
 
00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:09.240 align:start position:0%
statutory you know the ACT crunches the
 
00:08:11.309 --> 00:08:11.319 align:start position:0%
numbers and comes back with new rates so
 
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
depending on how investment experience
 
00:08:15.869 --> 00:08:15.879 align:start position:0%
demographic experience happened
 
00:08:18.909 --> 00:08:18.919 align:start position:0%
certainly the rates could fluctuate um
 
00:08:21.469 --> 00:08:21.479 align:start position:0%
you know over twoyear periods ultimately
 
00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:23.560 align:start position:0%
once the bulk of the unfunded is paid
 
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
off in in the end of the 2030s you know
 
00:08:28.589 --> 00:08:28.599 align:start position:0%
we're going to see a fairly large cliff
 
00:08:31.629 --> 00:08:31.639 align:start position:0%
in the rates at that point yeah followup
 
00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:34.760 align:start position:0%
question follow and then just going back
 
00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:38.240 align:start position:0%
to the discussion we had last week the
 
00:08:40.829 --> 00:08:40.839 align:start position:0%
number of
 
00:08:40.839 --> 00:08:43.269 align:start position:0%
number of
1731

00:08:43.269 --> 00:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
1731
 
00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:47.200 align:start position:0%
employees um for the tier B what is
 
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
identified as tier B that number is from
 
00:08:54.829 --> 00:08:54.839 align:start position:0%
last year correct correct so that number
 
00:08:57.829 --> 00:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
may have declined a bit since then yeah
 
00:08:59.870 --> 00:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
I we we expect to get some final
 
00:09:01.389 --> 00:09:01.399 align:start position:0%
headcount numbers and things you know
 
00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
broken out by the the tiers from the
 
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
actuary fairly soon this month but um
 
00:09:10.509 --> 00:09:10.519 align:start position:0%
you know um but yet but as PRI our prior
 
00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:12.360 align:start position:0%
conversation yeah that it's going to be
 
00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:14.440 align:start position:0%
less than 1732 because people have in
 
00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:16.760 align:start position:0%
that tier have left service either
 
00:09:18.829 --> 00:09:18.839 align:start position:0%
through retirement or we choosing to
 
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:21.880 align:start position:0%
move on over the past year and and as
 
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
the number shrinks there's you know
 
00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:26.680 align:start position:0%
there's more of an unfunded impact for
 
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:28.120 align:start position:0%
that tier because they have more years
 
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
in the system already so you know these
 
00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:32.120 align:start position:0%
these numbers again should be thought of
 
00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:34.720 align:start position:0%
as sort of a you know the ceiling for
 
00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:37.880 align:start position:0%
numbers and it may ultimately um have
 
00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:39.480 align:start position:0%
less pressure on the rates by an
 
00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
indeterminable amount not you I can't
 
00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
say it's going to be a lot it could be
 
00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:45.200 align:start position:0%
next to nothing or it could be no
 
00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:47.360 align:start position:0%
disable but yeah thank
 
00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
you other questions Senator Greg I just
 
00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
want to make it
 
00:09:53.829 --> 00:09:53.839 align:start position:0%
clear I just want to make it clear for
 
00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
people uh whether the 3.3 is an annual
 
00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
cost an estimate made an annual cost or
 
00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
is that a cost over a period of time and
 
00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:06.200 align:start position:0%
I believe it is an annual cost yeah that
 
00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:08.200 align:start position:0%
that's an annual cost basically when we
 
00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
talk about the percentages in an
 
00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
employer contribution rate it's a
 
00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:17.320 align:start position:0%
percentage of pensionable salary okay so
 
00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
um based on the payroll projections for
 
00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
what fiscal 26 is going to be uh for the
 
00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
police and fire the you know increase of
 
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
you know 0.95% of pay and 0.9 for is
 
00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:32.440 align:start position:0%
about 3 million so as payroll grows over
 
00:10:34.829 --> 00:10:34.839 align:start position:0%
time you know the actual dollar amounts
 
00:10:37.629 --> 00:10:37.639 align:start position:0%
would be likely to Rise um you know but
 
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
is a percentage of the the total pool
 
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
you know the you know the the percentage
 
00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:44.720 align:start position:0%
of pay shouldn't change follow up follow
 
00:10:48.949 --> 00:10:48.959 align:start position:0%
up so if I look at the 10-year cost I've
 
00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:52.600 align:start position:0%
got the 30 and I'm going to use the 15
 
00:10:56.269 --> 00:10:56.279 align:start position:0%
uh year one I would have the
 
00:10:59.389 --> 00:10:59.399 align:start position:0%
36.3 Y and then if I was getting all the
 
00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
way to
 
00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:05.320 align:start position:0%
2036 I would have an additional 33
 
00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:08.440 align:start position:0%
million so for a total cost
 
00:11:18.269 --> 00:11:18.279 align:start position:0%
of uh 33 plus 36 get me to 69 million it
 
00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
for for like you know back of the
 
00:11:21.949 --> 00:11:21.959 align:start position:0%
envelope math yes I mean you you would
 
00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to get a bigger slightly
 
00:11:25.629 --> 00:11:25.639 align:start position:0%
bigger envelope you you would just
 
00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:28.040 align:start position:0%
increase that 3.3 by the the payroll
 
00:11:30.509 --> 00:11:30.519 align:start position:0%
growth assumption which is like a
 
00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:32.680 align:start position:0%
2.75% a year so there there's a there's
 
00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:35.800 align:start position:0%
a nominal increase in that 3.3 but
 
00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:38.200 align:start position:0%
multiplying it by 10 and you know it's
 
00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
it's in that range I'm I'm just trying
 
00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:43.320 align:start position:0%
to give everyone a you know a sense of
 
00:11:45.389 --> 00:11:45.399 align:start position:0%
what it looks like for a 10year period
 
00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:47.560 align:start position:0%
yes yeah thank
 
00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:50.920 align:start position:0%
you Senator Bradley uh thank you madam
 
00:11:56.269 --> 00:11:56.279 align:start position:0%
chair so um Marty what is the 3.3
 
00:11:59.949 --> 00:11:59.959 align:start position:0%
million the normal cost that would be
 
00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
projected in rates represent as a
 
00:12:07.829 --> 00:12:07.839 align:start position:0%
percentage of the overall employer cost
 
00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:12.680 align:start position:0%
for um tier B and well the group two
 
00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
cost the overall employer
 
00:12:18.509 --> 00:12:18.519 align:start position:0%
costs okay um the employers are
 
00:12:20.189 --> 00:12:20.199 align:start position:0%
currently paying I think a little bit
 
00:12:22.949 --> 00:12:22.959 align:start position:0%
more than 600 million a year in total
 
00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:25.000 align:start position:0%
for all four member groups so this you
 
00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:26.600 align:start position:0%
know as as a percentage of total
 
00:12:29.629 --> 00:12:29.639 align:start position:0%
employer contributions you know 3.3 out
 
00:12:34.189 --> 00:12:34.199 align:start position:0%
of over 600 is that like a okay five or
 
00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:38.120 align:start position:0%
5% um yeah 0 five so yeah so so that's
 
00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:41.240 align:start position:0%
that's the uh you know that's that's the
 
00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:43.480 align:start position:0%
in context that's the the additional
 
00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:45.720 align:start position:0%
amount okay thank you and that's
 
00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
proportional too so a larger Community
 
00:12:50.189 --> 00:12:50.199 align:start position:0%
with more with a higher payroll for
 
00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:52.240 align:start position:0%
group two is going to pay more dollars
 
00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
than a smaller Community with little or
 
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
none but they'd have more employees they
 
00:12:59.389 --> 00:12:59.399 align:start position:0%
yeah just it's all based on payroll size
 
00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions from the
 
00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
commission Mr
 
00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:07.880 align:start position:0%
real thank you madam chair thank you
 
00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:10.760 align:start position:0%
Marty um I just want to uh clarify a
 
00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:14.720 align:start position:0%
question I think Senator Susi asked
 
00:13:19.949 --> 00:13:19.959 align:start position:0%
um employer rates are on schedule to
 
00:13:22.269 --> 00:13:22.279 align:start position:0%
decline as we pay off the unfunded
 
00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:24.920 align:start position:0%
liability is that correct
 
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
um for through
 
00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
2039 you know if all assumptions are met
 
00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:32.360 align:start position:0%
which we all know that isn't really
 
00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
possible in the real world with
 
00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:36.920 align:start position:0%
everything going on um they should be
 
00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
relatively within the same range as they
 
00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
are now for the next 15 years and when
 
00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:44.600 align:start position:0%
that liability is is um exercised and
 
00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:47.000 align:start position:0%
off the books in 2039 it'll have a more
 
00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
steep drop then but you know if to the
 
00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:53.000 align:start position:0%
extent that we um have investment
 
00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:55.160 align:start position:0%
performance you know better than
 
00:13:56.829 --> 00:13:56.839 align:start position:0%
expected that's going to lower the rates
 
00:13:59.430 --> 00:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
you know over the next 10 or 15 years uh
 
00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:01.240 align:start position:0%
that that's what happened with the rates
 
00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:03.560 align:start position:0%
in effect now the 2425 rates the
 
00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:06.160 align:start position:0%
investment performance and the F prior
 
00:14:08.509 --> 00:14:08.519 align:start position:0%
five years lowered them from what they
 
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
were the the two years before so there's
 
00:14:13.749 --> 00:14:13.759 align:start position:0%
going to be variability in the rates to
 
00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:15.320 align:start position:0%
some extent they could go up they could
 
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
go down but the Actuarial goal is to
 
00:14:21.069 --> 00:14:21.079 align:start position:0%
keep them relatively stable you know and
 
00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:23.320 align:start position:0%
then anything any good news is only
 
00:14:26.069 --> 00:14:26.079 align:start position:0%
going to lower them and
 
00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
then have the uh
 
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
the rate of return have they over longer
 
00:14:36.069 --> 00:14:36.079 align:start position:0%
periods of time have they exceeded the
 
00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:39.800 align:start position:0%
assumed rates um you know we we just
 
00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:43.000 align:start position:0%
posted um although another New Hampshire
 
00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
media picked it up we just posted our 23
 
00:14:47.509 --> 00:14:47.519 align:start position:0%
investment returns uh earlier this week
 
00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:51.240 align:start position:0%
and I believe the the the fiveyear
 
00:14:53.069 --> 00:14:53.079 align:start position:0%
average was um
 
00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:56.120 align:start position:0%
7% um and I think the 10 was
 
00:14:58.629 --> 00:14:58.639 align:start position:0%
7.6 um and you know our right now we're
 
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
assuming six and 3/4 so that that that's
 
00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:04.120 align:start position:0%
positive news that's what you you would
 
00:15:05.949 --> 00:15:05.959 align:start position:0%
consider the overage above your assume
 
00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:08.600 align:start position:0%
rate of return uh is an Actuarial gain
 
00:15:11.509 --> 00:15:11.519 align:start position:0%
and that that extra money that comes in
 
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
goes straight to lowering the unfunded
 
00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
and that's going to lower the rates so
 
00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:19.160 align:start position:0%
um you know as they say past performance
 
00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:21.680 align:start position:0%
isn't a guarantee but um we're happy
 
00:15:24.189 --> 00:15:24.199 align:start position:0%
with the the longer term you know five
 
00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:27.320 align:start position:0%
you know it was 8 8.2% this year and
 
00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:37.749 --> 00:15:37.759 align:start position:0%
well yes the we set the the rates every
 
00:15:41.269 --> 00:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
two years by calculating all the changes
 
00:15:45.069 --> 00:15:45.079 align:start position:0%
and that difference is laid on top of
 
00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
the current rate whether it's plus or
 
00:15:51.189 --> 00:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
minus so we're hoping hoping to have it
 
00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:55.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:56.910 align:start position:0%
 
not

00:15:56.910 --> 00:15:56.920 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:16:00.949 --> 00:16:00.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:12.440 align:start position:0%
Carlin okay Senator
 
00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:15.720 align:start position:0%
Susy thank you madam chair um at this
 
00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:19.240 align:start position:0%
time I'd like to make a motion to accept
 
00:16:21.829 --> 00:16:21.839 align:start position:0%
the second shaded plan which is
 
00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
identified as the gray 2.5 multiplier at
 
00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
10 years and if I could speak to my
 
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
motion uh please thank you
 
00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:34.440 align:start position:0%
um I think the creation of this
 
00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:37.240 align:start position:0%
commission although the language is
 
00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
Broad in scope looking at a number of
 
00:16:41.749 --> 00:16:41.759 align:start position:0%
retirement issues the creation really
 
00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:43.880 align:start position:0%
occurred because we were unable to
 
00:16:46.389 --> 00:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
quickly enough
 
00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
ascertain um a modified version of the
 
00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:52.600 align:start position:0%
language in houseo 436 dealing with the
 
00:16:55.829 --> 00:16:55.839 align:start position:0%
multiplier since that time we as today
 
00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
have gotten a series of numbers to to
 
00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:00.600 align:start position:0%
better quantify exactly the actions the
 
00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
legislature is taking and the concerns
 
00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
I've heard expressed about previous
 
00:17:10.029 --> 00:17:10.039 align:start position:0%
Plans offered are that they're too
 
00:17:13.189 --> 00:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
narrow in scope they only impact a small
 
00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:17.400 align:start position:0%
number this plan does not and they cost
 
00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:19.640 align:start position:0%
even more we were talking about upwards
 
00:17:23.949 --> 00:17:23.959 align:start position:0%
of 80 million I think the beauty of this
 
00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:27.400 align:start position:0%
plan is that it satisfies the concerns
 
00:17:31.789 --> 00:17:31.799 align:start position:0%
that people came in with it accomplishes
 
00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
what had always been the intention which
 
00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
is to come up with a way to retain
 
00:17:39.909 --> 00:17:39.919 align:start position:0%
employees um because that's one of our
 
00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:41.640 align:start position:0%
our biggest challenges right now is
 
00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:44.320 align:start position:0%
retaining and attracting new employees
 
00:17:46.029 --> 00:17:46.039 align:start position:0%
and I think this
 
00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
plan strives to hit the right balance
 
00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:53.000 align:start position:0%
and does actually hit the right balance
 
00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:57.200 align:start position:0%
in the benefit portion and also the cost
 
00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:00.720 align:start position:0%
portion um for our group two
 
00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
members and the only other thing I would
 
00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
add is we've also done something
 
00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
previously which I did file the bill on
 
00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:09.720 align:start position:0%
um the fiveyear vesting which would
 
00:18:12.549 --> 00:18:12.559 align:start position:0%
impact group one so I I I feel like the
 
00:18:16.789 --> 00:18:16.799 align:start position:0%
committee has hit a critical point where
 
00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
we are ready to make recommendations and
 
00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
for those reasons I would support the
 
00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
10year okay is there a second
 
00:18:27.909 --> 00:18:27.919 align:start position:0%
Mr thank you madam chair I would like to
 
00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
second uh Senator susi's motion uh for
 
00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
all the reasons that she U stated I'd
 
00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
like to Echo that i' also like to say
 
00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
that um you know when we when we started
 
00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:41.480 align:start position:0%
this process uh well over a year ago and
 
00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:44.360 align:start position:0%
having these conversations about how we
 
00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:47.240 align:start position:0%
can impact Recruitment and Retention in
 
00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
the state there was a lot of productive
 
00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
dialogue um obviously we we stalled out
 
00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
but when we developed this commission we
 
00:18:57.149 --> 00:18:57.159 align:start position:0%
all came in with the same uh goal in
 
00:18:59.669 --> 00:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
mind and that was to to fix uh a
 
00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
recruitment and retention issue that we
 
00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:03.440 align:start position:0%
all agreed that we have in the State uh
 
00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
firefighters police officers state
 
00:19:09.029 --> 00:19:09.039 align:start position:0%
troopers Corrections parole um there was
 
00:19:11.789 --> 00:19:11.799 align:start position:0%
no debate that we had a recruitment and
 
00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
retention problem the debate was on how
 
00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:19.000 align:start position:0%
we fix it and um you know there's plenty
 
00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:22.520 align:start position:0%
of data and plenty um of research to be
 
00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:24.400 align:start position:0%
done that shows that retirement is one
 
00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
of the number one um players in keeping
 
00:19:35.029 --> 00:19:35.039 align:start position:0%
qualified Personnel on the line and
 
00:19:37.149 --> 00:19:37.159 align:start position:0%
that's why we're here today and I think
 
00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
um you know this this proposal may not
 
00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
be everything that that the employees
 
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
wanted it may not be everything that the
 
00:19:46.669 --> 00:19:46.679 align:start position:0%
state wanted but I think that to some
 
00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
degree uh a compromise means everybody
 
00:19:53.549 --> 00:19:53.559 align:start position:0%
needs to walk away um feeling as though
 
00:19:56.909 --> 00:19:56.919 align:start position:0%
they got something that is impactful U
 
00:19:59.149 --> 00:19:59.159 align:start position:0%
but also a sense of of feeling a little
 
00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
bit uncomfortable um and that's what a
 
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
negotiation is and I appreciate
 
00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:05.200 align:start position:0%
everybody coming together and being
 
00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
willing to do this Senator gray we heard
 
00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:09.720 align:start position:0%
you um and your remarks and that you
 
00:20:13.029 --> 00:20:13.039 align:start position:0%
wanted to impact more than uh the 1700
 
00:20:16.029 --> 00:20:16.039 align:start position:0%
folks in the sliding scale um we heard
 
00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:19.720 align:start position:0%
you loud and clear we um are are fine
 
00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:23.000 align:start position:0%
with with agreeing to that um under this
 
00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
proposal and Senator Bradley we know
 
00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
that you needed the cost to come down
 
00:20:28.909 --> 00:20:28.919 align:start position:0%
and and as you mentioned last week week
 
00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
uh this this number or the number very
 
00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
similar to this one uh was getting
 
00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:34.520 align:start position:0%
closer and closer to the number that you
 
00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
were comfortable with so I think we've
 
00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
uh made a fine negotiation here and I
 
00:20:40.549 --> 00:20:40.559 align:start position:0%
support that thank
 
00:20:44.789 --> 00:20:44.799 align:start position:0%
you all right thank you any you Senator
 
00:20:44.799 --> 00:20:46.430 align:start position:0%
you all right thank you any you Senator
greay

00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:46.440 align:start position:0%
greay
 
00:20:49.549 --> 00:20:49.559 align:start position:0%
um I would have been very happy to
 
00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:52.400 align:start position:0%
support and even second the motion if we
 
00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
were doing the 15-year
 
00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:01.240 align:start position:0%
plan um taking it down to to 2.5 at the
 
00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
10e um becomes a problem for me okay uh
 
00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
the reason I was happy with the 15-year
 
00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:10.600 align:start position:0%
plan it would have been like halfway
 
00:21:13.149 --> 00:21:13.159 align:start position:0%
through their career okay figuring that
 
00:21:16.149 --> 00:21:16.159 align:start position:0%
they would work 30 years you know at 15
 
00:21:18.269 --> 00:21:18.279 align:start position:0%
years halfway through then we boost
 
00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:20.600 align:start position:0%
their rate from the two to the
 
00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:24.520 align:start position:0%
2.5 um the cost and again when I asked
 
00:21:27.549 --> 00:21:27.559 align:start position:0%
the questions before I looked at
 
00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
basically 10-year cost okay and since
 
00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
the rates don't adjust until 26 you're
 
00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
not going to see either that 3 million
 
00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:38.360 align:start position:0%
or the five million you know reflected
 
00:21:41.149 --> 00:21:41.159 align:start position:0%
in rates until that time but when you
 
00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:43.640 align:start position:0%
take that into consideration for that 10
 
00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
years from 26 to
 
00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
36 um that is a significant number and
 
00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:53.720 align:start position:0%
that when you look at it uh over the two
 
00:21:56.269 --> 00:21:56.279 align:start position:0%
different plans that's that's just under
 
00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
$40 million the 37.6 I think is if I'm
 
00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:02.120 align:start position:0%
looking in the right place on my
 
00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:06.200 align:start position:0%
scribble sheet here um
 
00:22:09.149 --> 00:22:09.159 align:start position:0%
and it's you know given the economy that
 
00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
we're in given the other obligations
 
00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:16.200 align:start position:0%
that we're going to have um that's why I
 
00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:20.720 align:start position:0%
would be more comfortable at the 15-year
 
00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
Point uh with the 36.3 million plus the
 
00:22:30.669 --> 00:22:30.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:30.679 --> 00:22:32.549 align:start position:0%
 
anyone

00:22:32.549 --> 00:22:32.559 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
00:22:34.909 --> 00:22:34.919 align:start position:0%
else Senator
 
00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:37.400 align:start position:0%
Bradley um thank you very
 
00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
much so I find myself in
 
00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
agreement um on a principal basis with
 
00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
Senator Susi Mr reel and Senator gray
 
00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:53.480 align:start position:0%
because um these two versions actually
 
00:22:58.390 --> 00:22:58.400 align:start position:0%
do address retention and Group C and if
 
00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
we're going to deal with retention we
 
00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:02.440 align:start position:0%
have to address Group
 
00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:06.200 align:start position:0%
C so as I said last week
 
00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
um when the analysis of my Amendment
 
00:23:13.669 --> 00:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
which was just Group B came in at $43
 
00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:17.400 align:start position:0%
million um that was getting to the range
 
00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
of what I thought was
 
00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:23.480 align:start position:0%
affordable okay so I think
 
00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:25.190 align:start position:0%
affordable okay so I think
55

00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
55
 
00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:26.870 align:start position:0%
55
um

00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:29.149 align:start position:0%
um
really

00:23:29.149 --> 00:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:23:32.669 --> 00:23:32.679 align:start position:0%
is more than the affordability index
 
00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
that I'm willing to um go at this point
 
00:23:38.269 --> 00:23:38.279 align:start position:0%
and so just looking and and I want to
 
00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
tell you why just looking at the which
 
00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
we didn't have last week the final
 
00:23:44.669 --> 00:23:44.679 align:start position:0%
numbers for October they were they were
 
00:23:46.149 --> 00:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
better than
 
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
anticipated we have a general fund
 
00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
surplus of $58 million so we would
 
00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
basically use 96% of the existing
 
00:23:58.549 --> 00:23:58.559 align:start position:0%
Surplus to fund
 
00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
The Upfront cost of this
 
00:24:04.789 --> 00:24:04.799 align:start position:0%
benefit I think that's a bridge too far
 
00:24:07.029 --> 00:24:07.039 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry to say it but that's what I
 
00:24:10.909 --> 00:24:10.919 align:start position:0%
think and here's why I think that
 
00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:13.640 align:start position:0%
so what Senator gray and I because we're
 
00:24:15.669 --> 00:24:15.679 align:start position:0%
both on the fiscal committee have access
 
00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
to and I it's it is a public document
 
00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:21.880 align:start position:0%
and you can find it um on Justice brc's
 
00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:23.320 align:start position:0%
website for the
 
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
YDC um settlement process or Mr Kane can
 
00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
get it to anybody it's a public
 
00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:31.470 align:start position:0%
get it to anybody it's a public
document

00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:31.480 align:start position:0%
document
 
00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:34.600 align:start position:0%
so right now as of the end of the third
 
00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:38.200 align:start position:0%
quarter 180 claims have been filed by
 
00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:41.240 align:start position:0%
the YDC about $13 million in benefits
 
00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:44.840 align:start position:0%
have been paid out that's about
 
00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
$460,000 per claim
 
00:24:51.909 --> 00:24:51.919 align:start position:0%
the amount of filings are accelerating
 
00:24:53.669 --> 00:24:53.679 align:start position:0%
that's a good thing that was why the
 
00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
fund was
 
00:24:58.950 --> 00:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
created 180 claim claims have been
 
00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
filed the aggregate amount of money of
 
00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
the claims filed through quarter 3 is
 
00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:08.590 align:start position:0%
the claims filed through quarter 3 is
174.000

00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:08.600 align:start position:0%
174.000
 
00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
million and when I asked the question of
 
00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:15.320 align:start position:0%
you know this is as of the end of third
 
00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
quarter so October more claims are
 
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.070 align:start position:0%
quarter so October more claims are
coming

00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
coming
 
00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
in so I'm just troubled sorry to say it
 
00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:26.669 align:start position:0%
in so I'm just troubled sorry to say it
by

00:25:26.669 --> 00:25:26.679 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
dedicating over 95% of today's
 
00:25:34.269 --> 00:25:34.279 align:start position:0%
Surplus to this purpose and this purpose
 
00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
alone when we're looking at this right
 
00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
in the face knowing that this is a big
 
00:25:44.389 --> 00:25:44.399 align:start position:0%
issue that has to be dealt
 
00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:46.840 align:start position:0%
with I don't know what the end results
 
00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:49.720 align:start position:0%
going to be of the YDC
 
00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:53.240 align:start position:0%
process I don't know my crystal hat
 
00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't say if you know next year is
 
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
going to be a good year or bad year
 
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
economically a lot of people are
 
00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:04.640 align:start position:0%
predicting you know a recession with 8%
 
00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.110 align:start position:0%
predicting you know a recession with 8%
interest

00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:06.120 align:start position:0%
interest
 
00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
rates um you know in the home mortgage
 
00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:12.200 align:start position:0%
our our real estate transfer tax is
 
00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
already off will business taxes be off
 
00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:19.000 align:start position:0%
we don't know we don't know and
 
00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.710 align:start position:0%
we don't know we don't know and
knowing

00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
knowing
 
00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
um you know what we're facing I think
 
00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:28.760 align:start position:0%
the more cautious approach is the right
 
00:26:32.389 --> 00:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
approach and if this motion is rejected
 
00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:34.720 align:start position:0%
either Senator gray or I will make the
 
00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
subsequent motion to recommend
 
00:26:39.909 --> 00:26:39.919 align:start position:0%
legislation at the $36
 
00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
million uh 15-year range that I think is
 
00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:47.480 align:start position:0%
achievable and gets through the
 
00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:50.440 align:start position:0%
process and if there's anything I've
 
00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:53.360 align:start position:0%
learned over my time in this building is
 
00:26:56.149 --> 00:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
how do you get to the end of the process
 
00:26:59.190 --> 00:26:59.200 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot that goes into getting
 
00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:00.269 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot that goes into getting
to

00:27:00.269 --> 00:27:00.279 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
yes and the other thing that I would say
 
00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:08.720 align:start position:0%
is you can't look at um whether it's $36
 
00:27:12.549 --> 00:27:12.559 align:start position:0%
million or $55 million in a vacuum we
 
00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
all voted
 
00:27:18.549 --> 00:27:18.559 align:start position:0%
for House Bill 1587 which as I recall
 
00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
cost $ 42.9 million in
 
00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
2022 so whatever you want to call it
 
00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:29.200 align:start position:0%
um if we were to
 
00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:34.120 align:start position:0%
do the 15year and $36 million plus the
 
00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
42 that we did a couple of years ago
 
00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
that's almost $80 million for relatively
 
00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
small group of people now I happen to
 
00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:43.720 align:start position:0%
think it's worthwhile given our
 
00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:47.240 align:start position:0%
retention issues given the duress that
 
00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:50.200 align:start position:0%
our Public Safety folks are
 
00:27:53.669 --> 00:27:53.679 align:start position:0%
facing but at the at the end of the day
 
00:27:57.149 --> 00:27:57.159 align:start position:0%
we also have to be cognizant in my
 
00:27:57.159 --> 00:27:58.190 align:start position:0%
we also have to be cognizant in my
opinion

00:27:58.190 --> 00:27:58.200 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:02.120 align:start position:0%
of you know
 
00:28:06.389 --> 00:28:06.399 align:start position:0%
this problem that we are facing
 
00:28:11.029 --> 00:28:11.039 align:start position:0%
that with potentially a thousand claims
 
00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:14.360 align:start position:0%
out there for YDC and knowing that the
 
00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:17.640 align:start position:0%
aggregate request for the 180 that have
 
00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
been filed today is $175 million I think
 
00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
that the prudent course is to
 
00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
recommend the 15 years so I'll be voting
 
00:28:32.269 --> 00:28:32.279 align:start position:0%
against it I hope that motion fails and
 
00:28:35.269 --> 00:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
then either as I said Senator gray or I
 
00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
will introduce the subsequent
 
00:28:43.269 --> 00:28:43.279 align:start position:0%
motion Senator Waters thank you madam
 
00:28:43.279 --> 00:28:45.509 align:start position:0%
motion Senator Waters thank you madam
chair

00:28:45.509 --> 00:28:45.519 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:48.640 align:start position:0%
um I do think that you know we know that
 
00:28:51.269 --> 00:28:51.279 align:start position:0%
whatever vote we take today it's just a
 
00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:52.760 align:start position:0%
recommendation to the commission and
 
00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
that the real work will be done uh when
 
00:28:58.870 --> 00:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
it comes to early next year here and we
 
00:29:00.789 --> 00:29:00.799 align:start position:0%
will have some more numbers at that
 
00:29:04.269 --> 00:29:04.279 align:start position:0%
point my own take on this is that while
 
00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
I really understand the what's hanging
 
00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:09.240 align:start position:0%
over us with the
 
00:29:13.669 --> 00:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
YDC money um it just it's a little hard
 
00:29:16.509 --> 00:29:16.519 align:start position:0%
to think that we're in a situation where
 
00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
one Injustice seems to
 
00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:22.200 align:start position:0%
be um and the funding for that is going
 
00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:24.640 align:start position:0%
to preempt potentially trying to address
 
00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
another Injustice which is the way I see
 
00:29:30.549 --> 00:29:30.559 align:start position:0%
what the situation we're in here and it
 
00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
just the more and more we talk about it
 
00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:34.480 align:start position:0%
the more awkward it seems to me that
 
00:29:36.669 --> 00:29:36.679 align:start position:0%
that that is the reason why we can't do
 
00:29:39.149 --> 00:29:39.159 align:start position:0%
what I think is appropriate policy but
 
00:29:42.389 --> 00:29:42.399 align:start position:0%
you know dollars are dollars um my own
 
00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:45.080 align:start position:0%
sense of this um particular addressing
 
00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley um on this is
 
00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:49.960 align:start position:0%
that I do think that the motion that's
 
00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
made is
 
00:29:55.549 --> 00:29:55.559 align:start position:0%
aspirational in that it recognizes that
 
00:29:58.630 --> 00:29:58.640 align:start position:0%
this is a way to address some important
 
00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
principles to expand a number of people
 
00:30:04.669 --> 00:30:04.679 align:start position:0%
covered um to go to the 10 years and I
 
00:30:07.269 --> 00:30:07.279 align:start position:0%
think potentially affordable we will
 
00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:10.760 align:start position:0%
have a couple three more months of
 
00:30:13.149 --> 00:30:13.159 align:start position:0%
Revenue um before we have to take votes
 
00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:15.440 align:start position:0%
on the in committees and on the on the
 
00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
floor on this so I I I think it would be
 
00:30:20.029 --> 00:30:20.039 align:start position:0%
I personally it be better for us to pass
 
00:30:20.039 --> 00:30:20.789 align:start position:0%
I personally it be better for us to pass
this

00:30:20.789 --> 00:30:20.799 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
motion understanding that it is going to
 
00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
be dependent on what the revenues look
 
00:30:28.149 --> 00:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
like in order to get support folks like
 
00:30:30.549 --> 00:30:30.559 align:start position:0%
yourself who who need to support it to
 
00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:32.480 align:start position:0%
pass it I don't think it would be
 
00:30:34.669 --> 00:30:34.679 align:start position:0%
inappropriate either to slice and dice
 
00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:37.360 align:start position:0%
it a little bit we got 15 years what if
 
00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
we had you know and we got 10 what if we
 
00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:41.720 align:start position:0%
had 11 years what if we had 12 years I
 
00:30:44.549 --> 00:30:44.559 align:start position:0%
think there's a way to do that I just
 
00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:46.600 align:start position:0%
fear that if we reject this motion and
 
00:30:49.669 --> 00:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
go with the other motion that um it is
 
00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:51.200 align:start position:0%
it is I think it's going to be very
 
00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:52.149 align:start position:0%
it is I think it's going to be very
difficult

00:30:52.149 --> 00:30:52.159 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
to um to see that as as really
 
00:30:58.950 --> 00:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
addressing the the issues that we were
 
00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
wared to address thank you madam chair
 
00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:04.360 align:start position:0%
uh represent o Brian and then Senator
 
00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
I'll give to Senator Su first you
 
00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
haven't spoken oh okay well thank you
 
00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
Madame chair thank you Senator
 
00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:15.480 align:start position:0%
Susie uh I think Senator Bradley is wise
 
00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:18.360 align:start position:0%
to bring up you know concerns about the
 
00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:22.720 align:start position:0%
uh YDC situation that is pending but
 
00:31:26.029 --> 00:31:26.039 align:start position:0%
however in my time and it's been uh I
 
00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
don't know 15 years like you madam chair
 
00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:31.240 align:start position:0%
a long time up here there's always got
 
00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:34.120 align:start position:0%
to be something that's coming over the
 
00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
horizon okay it's time to stop that you
 
00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:41.320 align:start position:0%
know let's focus with what's in front of
 
00:31:44.669 --> 00:31:44.679 align:start position:0%
us right now and here is the important
 
00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:47.240 align:start position:0%
thing you take communities such that I
 
00:31:48.549 --> 00:31:48.559 align:start position:0%
represent in
 
00:31:52.149 --> 00:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
Nash the state used to pay the 35% now
 
00:31:54.190 --> 00:31:54.200 align:start position:0%
it's down to nothing and that is born by
 
00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
the city of Nashville yet now what used
 
00:32:00.789 --> 00:32:00.799 align:start position:0%
to be the old adage that the job stinks
 
00:32:03.029 --> 00:32:03.039 align:start position:0%
but the bennies are great now the job
 
00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
stinks and the Benny stink and we can't
 
00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:09.080 align:start position:0%
get people to come in and try to get
 
00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:12.120 align:start position:0%
into this type of position it's fine
 
00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:13.960 align:start position:0%
when you live in a community that has a
 
00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
volunteer Force but nashar cannot or
 
00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
ever even cons seem to have a volunteer
 
00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
Force because businesses will not allow
 
00:32:27.549 --> 00:32:27.559 align:start position:0%
people to disappear during the day to go
 
00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:29.440 align:start position:0%
out to answer some of the alarms and
 
00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:32.240 align:start position:0%
Medicals and stuff like that my son is
 
00:32:34.909 --> 00:32:34.919 align:start position:0%
on the fire department his average shift
 
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
is almost like 15 runs per shift so
 
00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
therefore the needs of the city uh are
 
00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
great and I think I could speak well for
 
00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:47.720 align:start position:0%
nashal and its mayor they're coming to
 
00:32:52.269 --> 00:32:52.279 align:start position:0%
the I'm going to support the uh the
 
00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
second part of the gray proposal the
 
00:32:58.590 --> 00:32:58.600 align:start position:0%
55.9 million because it will solve the
 
00:33:00.789 --> 00:33:00.799 align:start position:0%
problem that's directly right in front
 
00:33:03.549 --> 00:33:03.559 align:start position:0%
of us that's what we need to focus on
 
00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
again always something on the horizon
 
00:33:08.269 --> 00:33:08.279 align:start position:0%
that's going to deter our our shiny
 
00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
objects is going to distract our
 
00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
attention let's solve one problem at a
 
00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
time and what's in front of us right now
 
00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
I think is the uh the second grace
 
00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:21.200 align:start position:0%
proposal so I support it thank you madam
 
00:33:24.669 --> 00:33:24.679 align:start position:0%
chair Susy thank you madam chair um I
 
00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
just want to reiterate what I said
 
00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:29.440 align:start position:0%
earlier during the budget process we
 
00:33:31.629 --> 00:33:31.639 align:start position:0%
were literally on the precipice of
 
00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:34.600 align:start position:0%
adopting a plan we were extremely
 
00:33:38.669 --> 00:33:38.679 align:start position:0%
extremely close but for more precise
 
00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
numbers we would have adopted an earlier
 
00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:43.360 align:start position:0%
version of a plan that would have only
 
00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:45.720 align:start position:0%
impacted the smaller group so the fact
 
00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
that we're here talking about a plan
 
00:33:50.509 --> 00:33:50.519 align:start position:0%
that impacts even more I think is better
 
00:33:52.629 --> 00:33:52.639 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm actually glad that we've been
 
00:33:55.230 --> 00:33:55.240 align:start position:0%
able to move forward with respect to the
 
00:33:57.950 --> 00:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
Surplus I would say this Senator Bradley
 
00:33:59.230 --> 00:33:59.240 align:start position:0%
I haven't brought this up at the
 
00:34:00.750 --> 00:34:00.760 align:start position:0%
commission but I have brought up with
 
00:34:04.750 --> 00:34:04.760 align:start position:0%
you privately um I think there is apart
 
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
from the existing surplus of General
 
00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:10.760 align:start position:0%
funds another way to fully fund this
 
00:34:13.589 --> 00:34:13.599 align:start position:0%
plan and I have introduced legislation
 
00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:16.280 align:start position:0%
confidential at this point um but it
 
00:34:18.750 --> 00:34:18.760 align:start position:0%
would be legislation to cap the
 
00:34:22.589 --> 00:34:22.599 align:start position:0%
education trust and there would be more
 
00:34:25.990 --> 00:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
than sufficient money to fund this
 
00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
proposal as it could currently stands um
 
00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:31.320 align:start position:0%
that is something that could at some
 
00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:33.560 align:start position:0%
point be attached to this proposal as it
 
00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:36.399 align:start position:0%
moves forward and I hope that it will be
 
00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
because I think we can fully fund this
 
00:34:42.909 --> 00:34:42.919 align:start position:0%
and put this issue um aside for the
 
00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:46.520 align:start position:0%
coming year once we enact this plan so
 
00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
once again for all those reasons that's
 
00:34:51.909 --> 00:34:51.919 align:start position:0%
why I do support the tenure Miss
 
00:34:54.149 --> 00:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
Stacy thank you madam chair so I'm going
 
00:34:56.349 --> 00:34:56.359 align:start position:0%
to add to Senator Bradley's comments and
 
00:34:58.230 --> 00:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
just let you to know as a register of
 
00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:01.720 align:start position:0%
deeds talking about revenues my transfer
 
00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
tax and L chip revenues are down almost
 
00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
20% they were down 15% last year this
 
00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
year I'm looking at over 20% and it's
 
00:35:12.349 --> 00:35:12.359 align:start position:0%
going to continue I've been in the
 
00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
business for over 30 years and looking
 
00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
at the Horizon um we're going to be
 
00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:21.640 align:start position:0%
struggling uh coming after the first of
 
00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:23.320 align:start position:0%
the year I know it and we've done it
 
00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:25.240 align:start position:0%
before and come out of it but our
 
00:35:29.790 --> 00:35:29.800 align:start position:0%
revenues are Statewide down considerably
 
00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:31.270 align:start position:0%
revenues are Statewide down considerably
thank

00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
you anyone out Mr real oh excuse me Mr
 
00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
Karen first he's hasn't spoken thank you
 
00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
madam chair uh one issue which has not
 
00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:41.200 align:start position:0%
been discussed today and I'm I'm Fair
 
00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
we're losing sight of it is the impact
 
00:35:46.349 --> 00:35:46.359 align:start position:0%
upon the property taxpayers all these
 
00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:48.520 align:start position:0%
proposals do include some additional
 
00:35:50.829 --> 00:35:50.839 align:start position:0%
increases to the rates which will go
 
00:35:52.069 --> 00:35:52.079 align:start position:0%
directly to our
 
00:35:54.750 --> 00:35:54.760 align:start position:0%
taxpayers uh looking back at the number
 
00:35:58.030 --> 00:35:58.040 align:start position:0%
which Senator Bradley was speaking of of
 
00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
last meeting which was the $43 million
 
00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
and I know I know it's not my money so I
 
00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
can play with the house money at this
 
00:36:05.069 --> 00:36:05.079 align:start position:0%
point uh you
 
00:36:09.109 --> 00:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
know if everyone agrees that this needs
 
00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
to happen for retention my experience
 
00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
tells me that's not accurate but let's
 
00:36:15.069 --> 00:36:15.079 align:start position:0%
presume it is for a minute then if you
 
00:36:17.589 --> 00:36:17.599 align:start position:0%
look at Senator Gray's proposal of 2.5%
 
00:36:21.309 --> 00:36:21.319 align:start position:0%
multiplier at 20 years that cost is 18.5
 
00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
million the Delta between
 
00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:26.440 align:start position:0%
18.5 and the 43 we spoke of at the last
 
00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:29.240 align:start position:0%
meeting is about 25 million on that one
 
00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:30.760 align:start position:0%
there's a one-time State appropriation
 
00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
of 185 and the increase in group two
 
00:36:35.950 --> 00:36:35.960 align:start position:0%
rates is 1.7 million if we can take the
 
00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:38.200 align:start position:0%
Delta between the 43 and the 18 which is
 
00:36:41.470 --> 00:36:41.480 align:start position:0%
about 25 an advanced fund and a separate
 
00:36:43.829 --> 00:36:43.839 align:start position:0%
Fund in the retirement system to pay for
 
00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:46.040 align:start position:0%
the contributions of the rates that'll
 
00:36:48.589 --> 00:36:48.599 align:start position:0%
cover the increase in rates of 14 years
 
00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:51.640 align:start position:0%
and 14 years bring us almost to the end
 
00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
of the agreement we all had in which
 
00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
Municipal rates went through the roof to
 
00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
pay for all of our trans transgressions
 
00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
of the past so I I would hope that the
 
00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:02.280 align:start position:0%
uh commission would consider that
 
00:37:04.309 --> 00:37:04.319 align:start position:0%
proposal as
 
00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
well so could you be so your proposal is
 
00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:10.109 align:start position:0%
well so could you be so your proposal is
to

00:37:10.109 --> 00:37:10.119 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:37:15.069 --> 00:37:15.079 align:start position:0%
take the basic Senator Senator Greg
 
00:37:15.079 --> 00:37:17.790 align:start position:0%
take the basic Senator Senator Greg
and

00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:17.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
um could you explain what your proposal
 
00:37:22.109 --> 00:37:22.119 align:start position:0%
exactly so I know if you look at the
 
00:37:24.309 --> 00:37:24.319 align:start position:0%
bottom of the second page which Marty
 
00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:27.160 align:start position:0%
passed out to us it says of the gray
 
00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:30.760 align:start position:0%
proposal at 2.5% multiplier at 20 years
 
00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
right there's a onetime state
 
00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:35.560 align:start position:0%
appropriation of$ 18.5 million but there
 
00:37:37.829 --> 00:37:37.839 align:start position:0%
is an impact on the rates of $1.7
 
00:37:41.309 --> 00:37:41.319 align:start position:0%
million a year if you look at that what
 
00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
I consider to be the target number of 43
 
00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:46.520 align:start position:0%
million you spend 18 one time leaves you
 
00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:49.720 align:start position:0%
a balance of 25 and if you through
 
00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:52.280 align:start position:0%
legislation put that in a fund to offset
 
00:37:55.349 --> 00:37:55.359 align:start position:0%
the rate increases of 1.7 that covers
 
00:37:58.309 --> 00:37:58.319 align:start position:0%
those rate increases for 14 years which
 
00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
essentially gets us to
 
00:38:04.030 --> 00:38:04.040 align:start position:0%
2037 and there's a 2-year gap between
 
00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:05.960 align:start position:0%
then and when the employer rates will
 
00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:08.560 align:start position:0%
drop because uh our promise will have
 
00:38:10.750 --> 00:38:10.760 align:start position:0%
been fulfilled to pay off the unfunded
 
00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:13.630 align:start position:0%
been fulfilled to pay off the unfunded
acred

00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:13.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
liability ah
 
00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:23.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
else Mr
 
00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:27.270 align:start position:0%
else Mr
martines

00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
martines
 
00:38:29.950 --> 00:38:29.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I support this
 
00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:32.680 align:start position:0%
motion I think it should pass I think
 
00:38:36.069 --> 00:38:36.079 align:start position:0%
that we should go forward and then there
 
00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
will be opportunities to find different
 
00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
ways to fund it but this is not what
 
00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:42.200 align:start position:0%
we're doing today this is not a meeting
 
00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
about funding we are coming out with
 
00:38:48.069 --> 00:38:48.079 align:start position:0%
proposals and for bills that we should
 
00:38:51.270 --> 00:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
pass to examine what we can do to this
 
00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
one thing that we don't say enough is
 
00:38:57.150 --> 00:38:57.160 align:start position:0%
that these workers are the same workers
 
00:38:59.829 --> 00:38:59.839 align:start position:0%
that had 2% of their contribution
 
00:39:03.109 --> 00:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
increased with reduced benefits so we
 
00:39:05.470 --> 00:39:05.480 align:start position:0%
reduce benefits and we increase
 
00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
contribution and we keep not saying that
 
00:39:10.349 --> 00:39:10.359 align:start position:0%
enough times right but these are the
 
00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:12.680 align:start position:0%
same workers and then we recognize that
 
00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
we made a mistake but when it comes to
 
00:39:17.109 --> 00:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
the time that we got to do something to
 
00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
fix it then we want bring why this why
 
00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:21.240 align:start position:0%
that why this see there's always going
 
00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
to be enough wise there as to why we
 
00:39:25.950 --> 00:39:25.960 align:start position:0%
can't do something I say why not we
 
00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:28.720 align:start position:0%
should TR try this and go forward with
 
00:39:30.990 --> 00:39:31.000 align:start position:0%
the Motion makes a lot of sense and we
 
00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
can make it work so I hope you support
 
00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
that thank you
 
00:39:39.109 --> 00:39:39.119 align:start position:0%
okay Mr
 
00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
Fuller yes I just would also like to
 
00:39:43.829 --> 00:39:43.839 align:start position:0%
lend my support to Senator su's proposal
 
00:39:45.870 --> 00:39:45.880 align:start position:0%
I think it makes a lot of sense and just
 
00:39:48.309 --> 00:39:48.319 align:start position:0%
Echo some previous comments as well um
 
00:39:49.589 --> 00:39:49.599 align:start position:0%
while there's other issues on the
 
00:39:51.870 --> 00:39:51.880 align:start position:0%
horizon I can certainly respect that we
 
00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
have one issue in front of us right here
 
00:39:55.870 --> 00:39:55.880 align:start position:0%
and the fact is is that Senator sui
 
00:39:57.670 --> 00:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
proposal would I think address that
 
00:39:59.710 --> 00:39:59.720 align:start position:0%
issue fully so I think if we're looking
 
00:40:01.349 --> 00:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
at that if addresses the issue we should
 
00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
be looking at things one one thing at a
 
00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
time and if we can solve one thing here
 
00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:06.920 align:start position:0%
now then we should absolutely do it
 
00:40:13.230 --> 00:40:13.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:16.109 --> 00:40:16.119 align:start position:0%
else representa
 
00:40:19.390 --> 00:40:19.400 align:start position:0%
lean thank you madam chair I'll
 
00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
certainly be supporting rep uh Senator
 
00:40:24.829 --> 00:40:24.839 align:start position:0%
susi's motion and like to point out that
 
00:40:27.390 --> 00:40:27.400 align:start position:0%
we've been kicking this issue
 
00:40:30.069 --> 00:40:30.079 align:start position:0%
for more than a decade on the 1700
 
00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
employees and the house was willing to
 
00:40:35.630 --> 00:40:35.640 align:start position:0%
support both Democrats and Republicans
 
00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
an $80 million proposal just to take
 
00:40:42.990 --> 00:40:43.000 align:start position:0%
care of the 1700 employees uh I think
 
00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
this is a good compromise I would have
 
00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:47.440 align:start position:0%
still been happy with the initial
 
00:40:49.829 --> 00:40:49.839 align:start position:0%
proposal that was in $436 so the $80
 
00:40:51.990 --> 00:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
million but this takes it a lot further
 
00:40:54.190 --> 00:40:54.200 align:start position:0%
out to take care of another
 
00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
3,200 people that have been affected
 
00:40:59.829 --> 00:40:59.839 align:start position:0%
um I'd Echo all the positive remarks and
 
00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:04.280 align:start position:0%
I do sympathize with uh the remarks of U
 
00:41:08.069 --> 00:41:08.079 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley as far as the YDC issue
 
00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:10.640 align:start position:0%
I also serve on fiscal and very
 
00:41:13.109 --> 00:41:13.119 align:start position:0%
concerned about that situation but I
 
00:41:15.069 --> 00:41:15.079 align:start position:0%
think this is a time we need to put this
 
00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
issue behind us especially for those
 
00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
1700 people that have been affected for
 
00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:22.680 align:start position:0%
over a decade and again I hope you will
 
00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:25.240 align:start position:0%
support Senator susi's
 
00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:32.309 align:start position:0%
support Senator susi's
motion

00:41:32.309 --> 00:41:32.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:32.319 --> 00:41:35.670 align:start position:0%
 
any

00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:38.430 --> 00:41:38.440 align:start position:0%
else all right then um I think we should
 
00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:40.240 align:start position:0%
take a roll call on this one Mr real
 
00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:55.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:55.240 --> 00:42:02.270 align:start position:0%
 
roll

00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:05.510 align:start position:0%
 
no

00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:15.190 --> 00:42:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:18.349 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:42:18.349 --> 00:42:18.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:18.359 --> 00:42:21.349 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:42:21.349 --> 00:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:42:21.359 --> 00:42:25.150 align:start position:0%
yes
yes

00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:25.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:33.150 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:42:33.150 --> 00:42:33.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:37.950 --> 00:42:37.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:42.270 --> 00:42:42.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:47.470 --> 00:42:47.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:51.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:15.670 --> 00:43:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:19.829 align:start position:0%
 
six

00:43:19.829 --> 00:43:19.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:23.230 --> 00:43:23.240 align:start position:0%
okay in that case as we discussed
 
00:43:25.309 --> 00:43:25.319 align:start position:0%
earlier I'm going to recommend that
 
00:43:25.319 --> 00:43:27.589 align:start position:0%
earlier I'm going to recommend that
representative

00:43:27.589 --> 00:43:27.599 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
prepare to incorporate this
 
00:43:33.390 --> 00:43:33.400 align:start position:0%
recommendation into house bill 436 which
 
00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:41.630 --> 00:43:41.640 align:start position:0%
to we will do that we actually have
 
00:43:44.790 --> 00:43:44.800 align:start position:0%
scheduled a meeting for the division one
 
00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
members on this coming Tuesday at 900
 
00:43:51.309 --> 00:43:51.319 align:start position:0%
am. so we'll be discussing this um
 
00:43:55.069 --> 00:43:55.079 align:start position:0%
motion Amendment at that
 
00:43:58.230 --> 00:43:58.240 align:start position:0%
time okay that takes care of that
 
00:44:01.109 --> 00:44:01.119 align:start position:0%
recommendation are there any other
 
00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:03.400 align:start position:0%
additional plans that somebody wants to
 
00:44:05.309 --> 00:44:05.319 align:start position:0%
recommend to the
 
00:44:07.390 --> 00:44:07.400 align:start position:0%
legislature Senator
 
00:44:11.109 --> 00:44:11.119 align:start position:0%
gray um out of the last uh meeting I was
 
00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
asked to reduce my recommendation to
 
00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:16.240 align:start position:0%
writing I think that's been distributed
 
00:44:19.349 --> 00:44:19.359 align:start position:0%
to everyone it would provide enabling
 
00:44:23.069 --> 00:44:23.079 align:start position:0%
legislation to allow state employees to
 
00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:26.040 align:start position:0%
rece pursuant to a collective bargaining
 
00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
agreement up to a 5% match on their
 
00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
contributions to the public employees
 
00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:33.400 align:start position:0%
Deferred Compensation Plan established
 
00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:42.400 align:start position:0%
101-b okay just thank you is there a
 
00:44:46.430 --> 00:44:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:50.030 --> 00:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
motion yeah second okay moved by Senator
 
00:44:53.549 --> 00:44:53.559 align:start position:0%
gray seconded by Senator Waters to
 
00:44:56.549 --> 00:44:56.559 align:start position:0%
submit legislation to allow the the
 
00:44:59.549 --> 00:44:59.559 align:start position:0%
state to make matching payments to a
 
00:45:03.109 --> 00:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
Deferred Compensation Plan for its
 
00:45:05.710 --> 00:45:05.720 align:start position:0%
employees other Employers in the system
 
00:45:08.670 --> 00:45:08.680 align:start position:0%
already have that ability but the state
 
00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:11.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't Senator gray and I'll speak to
 
00:45:14.390 --> 00:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
the motion if I may M chair uh what you
 
00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
have in front of you is also a sample
 
00:45:20.430 --> 00:45:20.440 align:start position:0%
legislation when I went to OSS uh to
 
00:45:23.230 --> 00:45:23.240 align:start position:0%
discuss it with them uh they said that
 
00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:24.870 align:start position:0%
discuss it with them uh they said that
101

00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
101
 
00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:28.240 align:start position:0%
db7 uh would need to have an additional
 
00:45:30.589 --> 00:45:30.599 align:start position:0%
sentence put in uh which you see at the
 
00:45:33.589 --> 00:45:33.599 align:start position:0%
bottom in bold uh and the funding of any
 
00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
collectively bargaining matched
 
00:45:39.790 --> 00:45:39.800 align:start position:0%
contribution amount um modification to
 
00:45:43.589 --> 00:45:43.599 align:start position:0%
uh colon 8 uh which changes the title
 
00:45:45.030 --> 00:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
except for funding required for the
 
00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:46.470 align:start position:0%
except for funding required for the
matching

00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
matching
 
00:45:50.349 --> 00:45:50.359 align:start position:0%
contribution and then the the last one
 
00:45:52.109 --> 00:45:52.119 align:start position:0%
uh B would be a new
 
00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:54.640 align:start position:0%
paragraph um and it would talk to the
 
00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
state employees
 
00:45:59.589 --> 00:45:59.599 align:start position:0%
uh being able to do that uh also saying
 
00:46:00.990 --> 00:46:01.000 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:46:04.309 --> 00:46:04.319 align:start position:0%
agencies um should uh look at their
 
00:46:08.230 --> 00:46:08.240 align:start position:0%
other non-union employees and offer
 
00:46:10.069 --> 00:46:10.079 align:start position:0%
similar uh
 
00:46:15.109 --> 00:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
negotiations uh this uh there is no cost
 
00:46:17.710 --> 00:46:17.720 align:start position:0%
associated with this at this point uh
 
00:46:19.349 --> 00:46:19.359 align:start position:0%
because it would be something that they
 
00:46:21.790 --> 00:46:21.800 align:start position:0%
would do through bargaining uh and it
 
00:46:24.109 --> 00:46:24.119 align:start position:0%
would come through with a as a benefit
 
00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:27.400 align:start position:0%
cost similar to the way salary increases
 
00:46:30.910 --> 00:46:30.920 align:start position:0%
come um it would put the state employees
 
00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:34.640 align:start position:0%
On a par with those local employees who
 
00:46:37.630 --> 00:46:37.640 align:start position:0%
are already through other means uh able
 
00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
to do a matching contribution thank you
 
00:46:45.829 --> 00:46:45.839 align:start position:0%
okay Senator Waters wish to speak
 
00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
to um I hadn't planned to no
 
00:46:53.630 --> 00:46:53.640 align:start position:0%
okay anyone Senator Susi just a question
 
00:46:56.630 --> 00:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
and this is for Senator Greg or perhaps
 
00:46:58.870 --> 00:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
Mr martines knows what's the current
 
00:47:01.270 --> 00:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
expiration date of the existing state
 
00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:03.190 align:start position:0%
expiration date of the existing state
employee

00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:03.200 align:start position:0%
employee
 
00:47:06.910 --> 00:47:06.920 align:start position:0%
contract I'm not 100% sure on that the
 
00:47:09.109 --> 00:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
expiration of the contract that we have
 
00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
now I believe it will be in the next
 
00:47:14.430 --> 00:47:14.440 align:start position:0%
year June 30 uh of next year the
 
00:47:16.990 --> 00:47:17.000 align:start position:0%
contract that we have now it's enforced
 
00:47:19.230 --> 00:47:19.240 align:start position:0%
until then
 
00:47:22.109 --> 00:47:22.119 align:start position:0%
24 so as I understand it this would not
 
00:47:25.150 --> 00:47:25.160 align:start position:0%
apply until the next negotiation if it's
 
00:47:29.470 --> 00:47:29.480 align:start position:0%
successful would be July 1st 24th
 
00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:31.109 align:start position:0%
successful would be July 1st 24th
following

00:47:31.109 --> 00:47:31.119 align:start position:0%
following
 
00:47:35.470 --> 00:47:35.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:39.349 --> 00:47:39.359 align:start position:0%
else Senator Bray and then Mr Martin um
 
00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
just a comment on Senator sus um that
 
00:47:46.309 --> 00:47:46.319 align:start position:0%
certainly I would be willing to work
 
00:47:49.069 --> 00:47:49.079 align:start position:0%
with her on doing something that would
 
00:47:52.470 --> 00:47:52.480 align:start position:0%
make this effective uh sooner if uh the
 
00:47:55.069 --> 00:47:55.079 align:start position:0%
commission wanted to recommend it uh so
 
00:47:58.630 --> 00:47:58.640 align:start position:0%
that it could be uh available for June
 
00:47:59.710 --> 00:47:59.720 align:start position:0%
of next
 
00:48:03.390 --> 00:48:03.400 align:start position:0%
year but no no guarantees of
 
00:48:05.309 --> 00:48:05.319 align:start position:0%
course Mr
 
00:48:07.870 --> 00:48:07.880 align:start position:0%
martinz thank you madam chair I'd like
 
00:48:11.950 --> 00:48:11.960 align:start position:0%
to speak on the motion itself and uh
 
00:48:15.190 --> 00:48:15.200 align:start position:0%
with all respect to to the Senate to The
 
00:48:18.790 --> 00:48:18.800 align:start position:0%
Honorable Senator I do not believe that
 
00:48:22.349 --> 00:48:22.359 align:start position:0%
we need a legislative bill or law to
 
00:48:26.309 --> 00:48:26.319 align:start position:0%
tell us to Collective bargain anything
 
00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:30.640 align:start position:0%
for now I would say that in my mind the
 
00:48:33.349 --> 00:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
Deferred Compensation wheel it's already
 
00:48:37.309 --> 00:48:37.319 align:start position:0%
invented we have a Deferred Compensation
 
00:48:40.349 --> 00:48:40.359 align:start position:0%
Plan that most people a lot of people
 
00:48:44.109 --> 00:48:44.119 align:start position:0%
participate including myself so I would
 
00:48:46.910 --> 00:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
think that this is
 
00:48:51.030 --> 00:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
not anything in the Realms of what we
 
00:48:54.190 --> 00:48:54.200 align:start position:0%
need to do which is
 
00:48:58.510 --> 00:48:58.520 align:start position:0%
this we had a cost of living adjustment
 
00:48:58.520 --> 00:48:59.589 align:start position:0%
this we had a cost of living adjustment
since

00:48:59.589 --> 00:48:59.599 align:start position:0%
since
 
00:49:02.549 --> 00:49:02.559 align:start position:0%
1967 when the retirement system came
 
00:49:07.150 --> 00:49:07.160 align:start position:0%
together and is stayed in place until
 
00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
2011 it was always the intent of the
 
00:49:14.549 --> 00:49:14.559 align:start position:0%
legislature that we have a vital cost of
 
00:49:17.430 --> 00:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
living adjustment so much so that in
 
00:49:21.109 --> 00:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
1983 we put together a cola account
 
00:49:24.190 --> 00:49:24.200 align:start position:0%
which was not perfect it had some IRS
 
00:49:26.230 --> 00:49:26.240 align:start position:0%
implication it was not correct
 
00:49:28.430 --> 00:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
but like with any vehicle that is not
 
00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:30.640 align:start position:0%
working well you either fix it or
 
00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:33.240 align:start position:0%
replace it but in this case the state
 
00:49:36.630 --> 00:49:36.640 align:start position:0%
decided to stop driving altogether we
 
00:49:39.309 --> 00:49:39.319 align:start position:0%
cannot have a retirement system where
 
00:49:42.309 --> 00:49:42.319 align:start position:0%
the benefits will water and wash away
 
00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:44.480 align:start position:0%
over the years because of
 
00:49:46.470 --> 00:49:46.480 align:start position:0%
inflation the thing that would make
 
00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
sense is to return to what was meant to
 
00:49:52.750 --> 00:49:52.760 align:start position:0%
be and have a defined benefit
 
00:49:56.190 --> 00:49:56.200 align:start position:0%
Cola spelled out in RSA in our
 
00:49:59.589 --> 00:49:59.599 align:start position:0%
retirement system as we
 
00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
did a defined a Deferred Compensation
 
00:50:06.829 --> 00:50:06.839 align:start position:0%
Plan that will just replace what we have
 
00:50:09.910 --> 00:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
or duplicates that will
 
00:50:14.069 --> 00:50:14.079 align:start position:0%
only changes by having perhaps a
 
00:50:18.750 --> 00:50:18.760 align:start position:0%
employer Buy in I do not think that is
 
00:50:19.710 --> 00:50:19.720 align:start position:0%
what we
 
00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
intend to do I would think that this
 
00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
would only
 
00:50:27.589 --> 00:50:27.599 align:start position:0%
obfuscate the Mission and the goal to
 
00:50:30.349 --> 00:50:30.359 align:start position:0%
get cola back and fix it as it was
 
00:50:31.870 --> 00:50:31.880 align:start position:0%
always intended to
 
00:50:36.390 --> 00:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
be um so in because of that you know I
 
00:50:38.549 --> 00:50:38.559 align:start position:0%
do not support this this motion I think
 
00:50:41.470 --> 00:50:41.480 align:start position:0%
we need to stick to stick with working
 
00:50:43.349 --> 00:50:43.359 align:start position:0%
on a cost of leing adjustment as a
 
00:50:46.630 --> 00:50:46.640 align:start position:0%
defined benefit in RSA through New
 
00:50:48.430 --> 00:50:48.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement system thank you
 
00:50:51.789 --> 00:50:51.799 align:start position:0%
and I'll you thank you Senator BR uh
 
00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
just responding a little bit to uh uh
 
00:50:59.069 --> 00:50:59.079 align:start position:0%
gentleman 's comments um as to being
 
00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
able to do it now if you read U 101 B7
 
00:51:08.950 --> 00:51:08.960 align:start position:0%
and 101b colon 8 uh those Provisions
 
00:51:10.829 --> 00:51:10.839 align:start position:0%
there would prevent you for state
 
00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
employees from doing this um so you
 
00:51:18.069 --> 00:51:18.079 align:start position:0%
right now uh the local employees because
 
00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
they have done different things uh are
 
00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
able to do this whether they're doing it
 
00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
through a deferred Benefit Plan or
 
00:51:30.270 --> 00:51:30.280 align:start position:0%
whatever uh they have taken care of that
 
00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
uh but right now for a state employee
 
00:51:35.430 --> 00:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
you cannot do it okay you cannot
 
00:51:37.510 --> 00:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
dedicate the funds you can't spend the
 
00:51:40.349 --> 00:51:40.359 align:start position:0%
funds uh and and deposited into that
 
00:51:46.990 --> 00:51:47.000 align:start position:0%
because of uh 101 B7 and 101 B8 uh and I
 
00:51:48.430 --> 00:51:48.440 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:51:50.670 --> 00:51:50.680 align:start position:0%
although you know I would like to see
 
00:51:53.870 --> 00:51:53.880 align:start position:0%
something done for for the group one
 
00:51:56.230 --> 00:51:56.240 align:start position:0%
employees uh this is is the one thing
 
00:51:59.030 --> 00:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
that that that I think that we can do
 
00:52:02.750 --> 00:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
for group one um because this retirement
 
00:52:05.589 --> 00:52:05.599 align:start position:0%
commission is uh is not limited just to
 
00:52:09.589 --> 00:52:09.599 align:start position:0%
group two um and the discussion of any
 
00:52:12.510 --> 00:52:12.520 align:start position:0%
Cola um if there's a proposal in front
 
00:52:14.750 --> 00:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
of us we we'll vote on that certainly
 
00:52:18.030 --> 00:52:18.040 align:start position:0%
separately from from this proposal thank
 
00:52:23.069 --> 00:52:23.079 align:start position:0%
you yes Mr R thank you madam chair um I
 
00:52:25.630 --> 00:52:25.640 align:start position:0%
would uh also vote against this proposal
 
00:52:28.670 --> 00:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
for a few reasons first um I would like
 
00:52:32.829 --> 00:52:32.839 align:start position:0%
to uh address Senator Gray's uh comments
 
00:52:35.349 --> 00:52:35.359 align:start position:0%
that uh we're not doing anything for the
 
00:52:39.150 --> 00:52:39.160 align:start position:0%
group one folks and um while I support
 
00:52:40.870 --> 00:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
uh the cost of living adjustment
 
00:52:43.030 --> 00:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
conversation for all I think that's a
 
00:52:44.910 --> 00:52:44.920 align:start position:0%
part of a bigger uh discussion that
 
00:52:47.470 --> 00:52:47.480 align:start position:0%
needs to continue um and I understand
 
00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
we're limited on time with this
 
00:52:50.829 --> 00:52:50.839 align:start position:0%
commission but uh if there's an
 
00:52:52.950 --> 00:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
extension of the commission to discuss
 
00:52:54.630 --> 00:52:54.640 align:start position:0%
that issue I would love to be a part of
 
00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:55.829 align:start position:0%
that issue I would love to be a part of
those

00:52:55.829 --> 00:52:55.839 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:52:59.430 --> 00:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
conversations um but we also need to
 
00:53:01.829 --> 00:53:01.839 align:start position:0%
remember that the the legislature just
 
00:53:04.710 --> 00:53:04.720 align:start position:0%
passed um the the Social Security offset
 
00:53:07.829 --> 00:53:07.839 align:start position:0%
bill which was a pretty significant um
 
00:53:09.510 --> 00:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh Victory I think for for both the
 
00:53:13.549 --> 00:53:13.559 align:start position:0%
state and group one um last session and
 
00:53:15.430 --> 00:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
this was uh part of the problem that we
 
00:53:19.349 --> 00:53:19.359 align:start position:0%
were trying to fix was this um inequity
 
00:53:23.230 --> 00:53:23.240 align:start position:0%
on the uh group two uh or perceived
 
00:53:25.789 --> 00:53:25.799 align:start position:0%
inequity I should say um so
 
00:53:29.069 --> 00:53:29.079 align:start position:0%
so with that I think Senator Gray's
 
00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
proposal while I think it comes from a
 
00:53:33.390 --> 00:53:33.400 align:start position:0%
good place um I I believe that it's a
 
00:53:35.750 --> 00:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
solution in search of a problem um I've
 
00:53:38.030 --> 00:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
not heard this as an
 
00:53:41.710 --> 00:53:41.720 align:start position:0%
overwhelming uh issue with with group
 
00:53:45.109 --> 00:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
one employees uh I represent uh a few
 
00:53:46.789 --> 00:53:46.799 align:start position:0%
group one employees in in my
 
00:53:50.030 --> 00:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
organization and this has never come up
 
00:53:53.549 --> 00:53:53.559 align:start position:0%
um so with that I would um agree with M
 
00:53:57.309 --> 00:53:57.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
any else I'd like to say that simply by
 
00:54:05.430 --> 00:54:05.440 align:start position:0%
removing the prohibition on such a uh
 
00:54:09.309 --> 00:54:09.319 align:start position:0%
contribution by the employ employer to
 
00:54:12.589 --> 00:54:12.599 align:start position:0%
their to the existing plan that many
 
00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
employees are already contributing to
 
00:54:18.510 --> 00:54:18.520 align:start position:0%
this is doesn't say that it has to be
 
00:54:21.549 --> 00:54:21.559 align:start position:0%
negotiated or how it just says that if
 
00:54:24.549 --> 00:54:24.559 align:start position:0%
the employees choose to ask for it it's
 
00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
not illeg
 
00:54:27.950 --> 00:54:27.960 align:start position:0%
legal and so I I'm going to be
 
00:54:30.750 --> 00:54:30.760 align:start position:0%
supporting it on that
 
00:54:33.430 --> 00:54:33.440 align:start position:0%
ground anyone
 
00:54:36.230 --> 00:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
else all right
 
00:54:39.390 --> 00:54:39.400 align:start position:0%
um those in favor of Senator Gray's
 
00:54:44.750 --> 00:54:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:50.789 --> 00:54:50.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:55.390 --> 00:54:55.400 align:start position:0%
opposed ah the motion fails on a tie so
 
00:54:59.750 --> 00:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:03.470 --> 00:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:07.710 --> 00:55:07.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:12.470 --> 00:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
right in that case I think the immediate
 
00:55:15.630 --> 00:55:15.640 align:start position:0%
work of this commission is done we need
 
00:55:18.309 --> 00:55:18.319 align:start position:0%
to keep talking to each other because
 
00:55:21.230 --> 00:55:21.240 align:start position:0%
some of the issues that were brought up
 
00:55:23.190 --> 00:55:23.200 align:start position:0%
have not reached a
 
00:55:26.430 --> 00:55:26.440 align:start position:0%
solution possi living increases for one
 
00:55:28.430 --> 00:55:28.440 align:start position:0%
we have recommended I believe four
 
00:55:29.789 --> 00:55:29.799 align:start position:0%
pieces of
 
00:55:34.109 --> 00:55:34.119 align:start position:0%
legislation um the earlier vesting
 
00:55:38.589 --> 00:55:38.599 align:start position:0%
mandatory over only three and and um and
 
00:55:38.599 --> 00:55:39.750 align:start position:0%
mandatory over only three and and um and
this

00:55:39.750 --> 00:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:55:42.710 --> 00:55:42.720 align:start position:0%
plan uh but we have not come up with
 
00:55:45.910 --> 00:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
anything on the cost of living issue
 
00:55:49.309 --> 00:55:49.319 align:start position:0%
because we've been unable to reach any
 
00:55:51.670 --> 00:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
kind of even a rough agreement so we
 
00:55:54.029 --> 00:55:54.039 align:start position:0%
need to keep talking to each other to
 
00:55:56.190 --> 00:55:56.200 align:start position:0%
resolve that issue
 
00:56:00.589 --> 00:56:00.599 align:start position:0%
point of inquiry Madam chair uh in that
 
00:56:05.630 --> 00:56:05.640 align:start position:0%
list do we have an item
 
00:56:09.510 --> 00:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
for employees that already vested and
 
00:56:12.150 --> 00:56:12.160 align:start position:0%
left service and came back in a
 
00:56:13.990 --> 00:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
part-time position that would allow them
 
00:56:16.630 --> 00:56:16.640 align:start position:0%
to contribute to the retirement system
 
00:56:18.710 --> 00:56:18.720 align:start position:0%
because they already
 
00:56:22.190 --> 00:56:22.200 align:start position:0%
vested um I believe that's if a person
 
00:56:26.150 --> 00:56:26.160 align:start position:0%
comes back um
 
00:56:28.990 --> 00:56:29.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not miss Mr Carlin could you explain
 
00:56:31.309 --> 00:56:31.319 align:start position:0%
that issue to us I think you you're more
 
00:56:38.230 --> 00:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:41.549 --> 00:56:41.559 align:start position:0%
am thank you uh Madam chair for calling
 
00:56:43.910 --> 00:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
me up can I just clarify are you talking
 
00:56:46.950 --> 00:56:46.960 align:start position:0%
about a vested um member who ceases
 
00:56:48.589 --> 00:56:48.599 align:start position:0%
employment and then comes back in a
 
00:56:52.150 --> 00:56:52.160 align:start position:0%
part-time capacity yes okay so that that
 
00:56:54.270 --> 00:56:54.280 align:start position:0%
there's no law against that happening
 
00:56:55.829 --> 00:56:55.839 align:start position:0%
but the person wouldn't acrew any
 
00:56:58.549 --> 00:56:58.559 align:start position:0%
service for that part-time right now so
 
00:57:01.349 --> 00:57:01.359 align:start position:0%
I thought the question was creating a
 
00:57:03.029 --> 00:57:03.039 align:start position:0%
changing the law so that they could
 
00:57:05.950 --> 00:57:05.960 align:start position:0%
continue crew nhrs membership credit for
 
00:57:08.870 --> 00:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
that time continue to pay into the fund
 
00:57:11.990 --> 00:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
yeah they don't part-time person doesn't
 
00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
pay into the retirement system correct
 
00:57:14.950 --> 00:57:14.960 align:start position:0%
correct correct yeah and the employer
 
00:57:17.710 --> 00:57:17.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't pay anything on no no part-time
 
00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
employee is none of their salar is
 
00:57:22.789 --> 00:57:22.799 align:start position:0%
contributed to nhrs the employer doesn't
 
00:57:24.150 --> 00:57:24.160 align:start position:0%
pay anything on any of them now
 
00:57:26.510 --> 00:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
currently for all groups okay there
 
00:57:28.950 --> 00:57:28.960 align:start position:0%
there is definitions of um full-time
 
00:57:32.109 --> 00:57:32.119 align:start position:0%
permanent positions both um somewhat in
 
00:57:33.789 --> 00:57:33.799 align:start position:0%
the statute and also in our
 
00:57:36.910 --> 00:57:36.920 align:start position:0%
administrative rules to Define
 
00:57:39.390 --> 00:57:39.400 align:start position:0%
full-time no part-time person
 
00:57:42.150 --> 00:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
contributes to the retirement system
 
00:57:45.190 --> 00:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
whether they're previously employed or
 
00:57:48.029 --> 00:57:48.039 align:start position:0%
not so and I think that's a bigger issue
 
00:57:50.589 --> 00:57:50.599 align:start position:0%
it came up when Mr Fuller was talking
 
00:57:53.470 --> 00:57:53.480 align:start position:0%
about part-time
 
00:57:58.510 --> 00:57:58.520 align:start position:0%
people so Madam chair if I may I think
 
00:58:00.990 --> 00:58:01.000 align:start position:0%
I'm in favor of obviously to have
 
00:58:02.630 --> 00:58:02.640 align:start position:0%
part-time contribute to the retirement
 
00:58:05.630 --> 00:58:05.640 align:start position:0%
system but I'll say this is be a good
 
00:58:07.870 --> 00:58:07.880 align:start position:0%
place to start with an employee who's
 
00:58:09.910 --> 00:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
already part of the system who's already
 
00:58:12.750 --> 00:58:12.760 align:start position:0%
vested and would be an added value to
 
00:58:15.870 --> 00:58:15.880 align:start position:0%
the system to have further contributions
 
00:58:18.390 --> 00:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
that could be used for Investments and
 
00:58:22.950 --> 00:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
build that pension so I I would uh
 
00:58:25.710 --> 00:58:25.720 align:start position:0%
respectfully ask to uh include that in
 
00:58:27.910 --> 00:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
one of the uh items on this commission
 
00:58:31.950 --> 00:58:31.960 align:start position:0%
to look at as we go forward to allow
 
00:58:34.950 --> 00:58:34.960 align:start position:0%
full-time allow vested workers who
 
00:58:36.750 --> 00:58:36.760 align:start position:0%
retire come back
 
00:58:39.470 --> 00:58:39.480 align:start position:0%
part-time not retired come back
 
00:58:41.910 --> 00:58:41.920 align:start position:0%
part-time to contribute to the
 
00:58:45.150 --> 00:58:45.160 align:start position:0%
retirement system okay we will and and
 
00:58:46.270 --> 00:58:46.280 align:start position:0%
build a
 
00:58:49.950 --> 00:58:49.960 align:start position:0%
retirement I beg your pardon did someone
 
00:58:51.349 --> 00:58:51.359 align:start position:0%
someone wish to
 
00:58:55.510 --> 00:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
speak okay all right so we'll make that
 
00:58:59.870 --> 00:58:59.880 align:start position:0%
a comment that to look into part-time
 
00:59:04.510 --> 00:59:04.520 align:start position:0%
contributions bested well we you will
 
00:59:07.789 --> 00:59:07.799 align:start position:0%
have to look at the overall part-time
 
00:59:10.910 --> 00:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
issue I mean I don't think that that
 
00:59:13.510 --> 00:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
specific case would be common enough to
 
00:59:16.549 --> 00:59:16.559 align:start position:0%
be worth doing the proper analysis for
 
00:59:19.230 --> 00:59:19.240 align:start position:0%
it but looking at part-time employees
 
00:59:21.510 --> 00:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
yes we've got a lot of them Madam chair
 
00:59:25.750 --> 00:59:25.760 align:start position:0%
if I may follow up on bit uh we do have
 
00:59:29.670 --> 00:59:29.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of workers that are returning that
 
00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
return and they
 
00:59:34.789 --> 00:59:34.799 align:start position:0%
have vested uh not just group one one
 
00:59:38.309 --> 00:59:38.319 align:start position:0%
teachers uh and it might be group two as
 
00:59:40.870 --> 00:59:40.880 align:start position:0%
well I don't know but would be nice to
 
00:59:43.750 --> 00:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
look into it if if we may right thank
 
00:59:45.710 --> 00:59:45.720 align:start position:0%
you all
 
00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
right all right if no one else has any
 
00:59:52.710 --> 00:59:52.720 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley um I think either
 
00:59:55.109 --> 00:59:55.119 align:start position:0%
Senator gray or I will probably file a
 
01:00:00.029 --> 01:00:00.039 align:start position:0%
Minority Report um you know in support
 
01:00:01.270 --> 01:00:01.280 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:00:04.589 --> 01:00:04.599 align:start position:0%
15-year um proposal thank you that was I
 
01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:06.160 align:start position:0%

01:00:10.589 --> 01:00:10.599 align:start position:0%
report oh okay then I'll stop there okay
 
01:00:13.230 --> 01:00:13.240 align:start position:0%

01:00:16.870 --> 01:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
committee report and send it out
 
01:00:19.750 --> 01:00:19.760 align:start position:0%

01:00:22.510 --> 01:00:22.520 align:start position:0%

01:00:25.589 --> 01:00:25.599 align:start position:0%

01:00:31.510 --> 01:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
1st and I have another point of inquir
 
01:00:34.750 --> 01:00:34.760 align:start position:0%
Madam yes M Mar um did you say this
 
01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
report will include a study for the cost
 
01:00:39.990 --> 01:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
of living
 
01:00:42.510 --> 01:00:42.520 align:start position:0%
adjustment that's one of the issues that
 
01:00:45.630 --> 01:00:45.640 align:start position:0%
we need to keep in mind because we have
 
01:00:48.670 --> 01:00:48.680 align:start position:0%
not reached a conclusion in this group
 
01:00:52.309 --> 01:00:52.319 align:start position:0%
yes there there's a couple of
 
01:00:55.309 --> 01:00:55.319 align:start position:0%
open-ended items that we need need to
 
01:00:57.349 --> 01:00:57.359 align:start position:0%
keep thinking about and talking to each
 
01:01:00.430 --> 01:01:00.440 align:start position:0%
other about because as you've noticed
 
01:01:02.950 --> 01:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
we' that even this small group has some
 
01:01:04.910 --> 01:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
very different opinions on different
 
01:01:07.710 --> 01:01:07.720 align:start position:0%
things so we need to talk to each other
 
01:01:09.549 --> 01:01:09.559 align:start position:0%
and find out what's important and what
 
01:01:11.870 --> 01:01:11.880 align:start position:0%
needs to be done and cost of living
 
01:01:15.710 --> 01:01:15.720 align:start position:0%
increases are one of them okay I must
 
01:01:17.190 --> 01:01:17.200 align:start position:0%
