00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:53.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:53.840 --> 00:04:55.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:38.550 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you members
 
00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:43.919 align:start position:0%
for allowing me to introduce this
 
00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:47.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
i have
 
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
i have to say that as
 
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 align:start position:0%
i've heard the expression i'm hoping
 
00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
you'll agree that this is a no-brainer
 
00:05:56.309 --> 00:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
i've heard that probably four or five
 
00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720 align:start position:0%
times in the course of discussions with
 
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
folks talking about the bill so i'm
 
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
we'll see but my hope and is that this
 
00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:05.360 align:start position:0%
is a pretty straightforward
 
00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
bill the purpose of the bill
 
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
really is to ensure that there's a
 
00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:11.919 align:start position:0%
robust plan and transition for students
 
00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
with disabilities once
 
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
they prepare and ultimately leave public
 
00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:20.240 align:start position:0%
schools so that they become independent
 
00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
and civically engaged
 
00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
community participants which
 
00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:26.560 align:start position:0%
we all want whether we have children
 
00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
with disabilities or not is certainly
 
00:06:30.309 --> 00:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
the goal
 
00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:32.560 align:start position:0%
and the whole point i think of our
 
00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
public schools and our school system
 
00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:38.479 align:start position:0%
in is to ensure that we have
 
00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
competent participants who are actively
 
00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
engaged in their communities through
 
00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.309 align:start position:0%
engaged in their communities through
whatever

00:06:44.309 --> 00:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
means that may be
 
00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:47.600 align:start position:0%
and certainly the individuals with
 
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:49.840 align:start position:0%
disabilities education act and section
 
00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.029 align:start position:0%
disabilities education act and section
504

00:06:51.029 --> 00:06:51.039 align:start position:0%
504
 
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
are ways that we ensure that those
 
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
full educational opportunities are
 
00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.550 align:start position:0%
full educational opportunities are
available

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:56.560 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:06:59.110 --> 00:06:59.120 align:start position:0%
for students with disabilities so
 
00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
we've we've come a long way
 
00:07:04.469 --> 00:07:04.479 align:start position:0%
with that but we have a long way to go
 
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
in my conversations with parents
 
00:07:08.309 --> 00:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
as they talk about
 
00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
their experience with special education
 
00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
one of the most frustrating i shouldn't
 
00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
say frustrating but anxiety producing
 
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
moments in that conversation as they
 
00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:23.759 align:start position:0%
navigate a pretty complicated sometimes
 
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
intimidating system of special education
 
00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:27.909 align:start position:0%
intimidating system of special education
laws

00:07:27.909 --> 00:07:27.919 align:start position:0%
laws
 
00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
is when their child is prepared to is
 
00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
preparing to leave
 
00:07:33.029 --> 00:07:33.039 align:start position:0%
the schools
 
00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
there's a sense of anxiety and worry
 
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
that i think we all have
 
00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:38.639 align:start position:0%
for our kids
 
00:07:38.639 --> 00:07:39.589 align:start position:0%
for our kids
when

00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
we want to
 
00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:43.360 align:start position:0%
have our kids exit public schools
 
00:07:46.309 --> 00:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
and and be full independent participants
 
00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:48.560 align:start position:0%
in their community and society
 
00:07:50.309 --> 00:07:50.319 align:start position:0%
and there is
 
00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
a strong sense of anxiety and worry when
 
00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
parents reach this moment in time
 
00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:57.670 align:start position:0%
parents reach this moment in time
there's

00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:07:59.350 --> 00:07:59.360 align:start position:0%
and in fact i would suggest it's
 
00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
probably the most anxiety producing
 
00:08:04.629 --> 00:08:04.639 align:start position:0%
moment in a child's special education
 
00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
career if you will with with their
 
00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
parents um what this bill does is it
 
00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
leverages the pre-existing framework
 
00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:13.360 align:start position:0%
that we have with under special
 
00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:16.240 align:start position:0%
education law that's intended to
 
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
assist students with disabilities get
 
00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
the education the educational
 
00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:22.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity that they deserve
 
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
so that they are they can tap their full
 
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
potential once they leave school public
 
00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
formal schooling that's the whole point
 
00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
of public schools and schooling and
 
00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
that's the whole point of special
 
00:08:35.269 --> 00:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
education is that
 
00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:37.200 align:start position:0%
kids transition out
 
00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
we have existing frameworks particularly
 
00:08:42.469 --> 00:08:42.479 align:start position:0%
with the um individuals with
 
00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
disabilities education act under the
 
00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:46.160 align:start position:0%
requirement that there be transition
 
00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.190 align:start position:0%
requirement that there be transition
planning

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:47.200 align:start position:0%

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:50.240 align:start position:0%
for kids when they are preparing to
 
00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.350 align:start position:0%
for kids when they are preparing to
leave

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
leave
 
00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
public public schools and that there are
 
00:08:55.829 --> 00:08:55.839 align:start position:0%
goals that need to be set among the iep
 
00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
team with parents with the child with
 
00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
the school officials to ensure that
 
00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:02.720 align:start position:0%
once the doors open from the schoolhouse
 
00:09:04.389 --> 00:09:04.399 align:start position:0%
and they've graduated
 
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
or left the system
 
00:09:08.389 --> 00:09:08.399 align:start position:0%
that there is a web
 
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
and there is a network and there is some
 
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.030 align:start position:0%
and there is a network and there is some
plan

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
plan
 
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
b behind
 
00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
making sure that a child has their can
 
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:17.200 align:start position:0%
reach their fullest potential um
 
00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:20.720 align:start position:0%
it would be a shame if we invest
 
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
so much in our formal schooling to
 
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
ensure that children get the equal
 
00:09:26.389 --> 00:09:26.399 align:start position:0%
educational opportunity they deserve
 
00:09:29.509 --> 00:09:29.519 align:start position:0%
in the k-12 setting if you will but then
 
00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:32.720 align:start position:0%
the the the planning to go beyond isn't
 
00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
sufficient enough or isn't robust enough
 
00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
and that's part of the anxiety that i
 
00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:38.720 align:start position:0%
hear from parents it's part of what i
 
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:41.680 align:start position:0%
see and that's what this bill intends
 
00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
to address
 
00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
include section 504 as part of this bill
 
00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.630 align:start position:0%
include section 504 as part of this bill
because

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
that also captures and protects students
 
00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
with disabilities although it does not
 
00:09:53.269 --> 00:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
have a specific transition services
 
00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
requirement like the iep structure
 
00:09:58.310 --> 00:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
it seems to make if the whole goal is
 
00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
equal educational access and opportunity
 
00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:02.720 align:start position:0%
then it makes sense to include
 
00:10:05.269 --> 00:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
children with with section 504
 
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
plans the there is a second part of the
 
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
bill um this basically two operative
 
00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
parts part dealing with students with
 
00:10:13.509 --> 00:10:13.519 align:start position:0%
disabilities and transition planning in
 
00:10:15.269 --> 00:10:15.279 align:start position:0%
section 504
 
00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
the second part of the bill would
 
00:10:19.509 --> 00:10:19.519 align:start position:0%
relieve stu schools of that if they
 
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
already have
 
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:22.720 align:start position:0%
in school um
 
00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
voter registration drives my
 
00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
understanding in developing the bill is
 
00:10:27.509 --> 00:10:27.519 align:start position:0%
that there are few not many that already
 
00:10:29.509 --> 00:10:29.519 align:start position:0%
do this but the provision this bill
 
00:10:31.269 --> 00:10:31.279 align:start position:0%
requires that they and i hope that they
 
00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
would already be doing this if they're
 
00:10:34.389 --> 00:10:34.399 align:start position:0%
offering that service in school that
 
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
they are providing the accommodations
 
00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:38.240 align:start position:0%
that are required under 504 or a child's
 
00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
iep in any in an event but this bill
 
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
makes it clear that they must um why
 
00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
voting well
 
00:10:46.069 --> 00:10:46.079 align:start position:0%
this this would only start a
 
00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
conversation about registering to vote
 
00:10:51.509 --> 00:10:51.519 align:start position:0%
and it leaves it to the team
 
00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
be it a 504 team or iep team to
 
00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not that makes
 
00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
sense in that child's case and if so
 
00:11:00.949 --> 00:11:00.959 align:start position:0%
they make a plan to to do that
 
00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
voting obviously i think we could all
 
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
agree folks in this room um is of
 
00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
critical importance um i imagine you
 
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
know we're here
 
00:11:10.949 --> 00:11:10.959 align:start position:0%
as representatives by virtue of people
 
00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
who have voted um it's a fundamental
 
00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:16.240 align:start position:0%
right under the constitution um and so
 
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
it's we recognize that it's important
 
00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
but but
 
00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
there there's a symbolic and a
 
00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
substantive value to it that relates to
 
00:11:26.949 --> 00:11:26.959 align:start position:0%
the primary goal of special education
 
00:11:30.069 --> 00:11:30.079 align:start position:0%
which is to to prepare a child to go out
 
00:11:32.069 --> 00:11:32.079 align:start position:0%
in the world to be independent an active
 
00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:34.240 align:start position:0%
civic participant in the in their
 
00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:36.720 align:start position:0%
community and in the world and voting
 
00:11:39.269 --> 00:11:39.279 align:start position:0%
does that and even the conversation
 
00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
about registering to vote is an
 
00:11:43.509 --> 00:11:43.519 align:start position:0%
empowering conversation for a child and
 
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
a parent at a table to talk about you
 
00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
can make a difference there's a symbolic
 
00:11:49.269 --> 00:11:49.279 align:start position:0%
nature of going in there and we all i
 
00:11:49.279 --> 00:11:50.389 align:start position:0%
nature of going in there and we all i
think

00:11:50.389 --> 00:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
maybe we're political nerds we feel the
 
00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
thrill of you know voting for an issue a
 
00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
candidate whatever it is or a town
 
00:11:59.509 --> 00:11:59.519 align:start position:0%
meeting or wherever it is so there is an
 
00:12:02.069 --> 00:12:02.079 align:start position:0%
empowering feeling and i think for for
 
00:12:03.829 --> 00:12:03.839 align:start position:0%
children with disabilities in particular
 
00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
who have historically been marginalized
 
00:12:08.629 --> 00:12:08.639 align:start position:0%
um and still face obstacles once they
 
00:12:11.829 --> 00:12:11.839 align:start position:0%
leave school that is a particularly
 
00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
powerful effect that even the
 
00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
conversation about registering vote
 
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
never mind actually registering a vote
 
00:12:19.269 --> 00:12:19.279 align:start position:0%
or actually voting
 
00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
can can have and obviously there's the
 
00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
substantive value to it um you know in
 
00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:27.200 align:start position:0%
my town i think we'll probably get 10
 
00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
percent will vote in in the march uh
 
00:12:32.389 --> 00:12:32.399 align:start position:0%
election and that's a thousand people a
 
00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
give or take of registered voters one
 
00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
vote makes a difference we all know that
 
00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:38.240 align:start position:0%
we've seen elections decided on on on
 
00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
that so there's the the power to that
 
00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
but research shows that people who
 
00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
register to vote and people who vote are
 
00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:48.240 align:start position:0%
are active and engaged in their
 
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
community they belong to civic groups
 
00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
they um they care about who's on the
 
00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
local board of trustees for the library
 
00:12:58.069 --> 00:12:58.079 align:start position:0%
they are independent they are civic
 
00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
minded and that is the exact purpose of
 
00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
our public schools but also the exact
 
00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
purpose and promise of the special
 
00:13:09.509 --> 00:13:09.519 align:start position:0%
education laws that we have so
 
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
to me
 
00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
uh ensuring that that conversation
 
00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
happens at the iep table with the parent
 
00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
and with the child
 
00:13:20.629 --> 00:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
is is a gateway to leverage what we have
 
00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
now and fully allow a child to to
 
00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:26.720 align:start position:0%
to get the return on investment that we
 
00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
make in a child through the k to 12
 
00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
formal schooling once they leave school
 
00:13:32.389 --> 00:13:32.399 align:start position:0%
because the whole goal is to have them
 
00:13:34.389 --> 00:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
independent and self-sufficient and
 
00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
active members of their community um and
 
00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
and voting and registering a vote is is
 
00:13:42.389 --> 00:13:42.399 align:start position:0%
a means that has a direct link to that
 
00:13:44.629 --> 00:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
so that explains why why that is there
 
00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:46.720 align:start position:0%
it's consistent entirely consistent i've
 
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
submitted written testimony
 
00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:49.350 align:start position:0%
submitted written testimony
with

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:13:51.269 --> 00:13:51.279 align:start position:0%
the congressional intent
 
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
which i've i've comment i've noted in my
 
00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
written testimony of the idea the
 
00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
individuals disability education act in
 
00:14:00.389 --> 00:14:00.399 align:start position:0%
in terms of what we're trying to do so
 
00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
in some that's what this bill does it
 
00:14:03.829 --> 00:14:03.839 align:start position:0%
seeks really to leverage
 
00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
what we have as an infrastructure to to
 
00:14:08.629 --> 00:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
give students with disabilities make
 
00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:10.160 align:start position:0%
good on the promise that we give them k
 
00:14:12.069 --> 00:14:12.079 align:start position:0%
to 12 and make sure that that promise is
 
00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:14.240 align:start position:0%
kept uh there's there's a network in
 
00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
place for when those kids go on and
 
00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
become citizens in our our communities
 
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
and with that i'll take any questions
 
00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative are
 
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:27.509 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:14:27.509 --> 00:14:27.519 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:14:29.269 --> 00:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
representative litchfield thank you for
 
00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question thank you for
 
00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
bringing this forward i just wanted to
 
00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
ask you what do you know what now right
 
00:14:37.189 --> 00:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
now the standard is for children in the
 
00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:40.160 align:start position:0%
regular education program as far as them
 
00:14:42.069 --> 00:14:42.079 align:start position:0%
being taught the importance of voting
 
00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
and how you go out and register to vote
 
00:14:47.509 --> 00:14:47.519 align:start position:0%
i don't know i don't know thank you for
 
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
the question um i don't know the exact
 
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming that it it would occur i
 
00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
don't know if there's a standard that
 
00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
speaks to it if you know
 
00:14:59.430 --> 00:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
specifically um i know we passed i think
 
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
was the last session of build regarding
 
00:15:03.269 --> 00:15:03.279 align:start position:0%
the test for uh
 
00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
civics uh education i believe which you
 
00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
know makes what i'm doing pretty
 
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
consistent i think with what that that
 
00:15:11.509 --> 00:15:11.519 align:start position:0%
is i don't i don't know per se i would
 
00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
assume that
 
00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
i know some schools i believe
 
00:15:14.639 --> 00:15:15.750 align:start position:0%
i know some schools i believe
do

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:15:18.389 --> 00:15:18.399 align:start position:0%
offer some sort of in-service
 
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
voting registration drive i think it's
 
00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
not many
 
00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
so i assume that that conversation
 
00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:24.069 align:start position:0%
so i assume that that conversation
happens

00:15:24.069 --> 00:15:24.079 align:start position:0%
happens
 
00:15:26.069 --> 00:15:26.079 align:start position:0%
in that context if not in the context of
 
00:15:27.829 --> 00:15:27.839 align:start position:0%
perhaps a social studies
 
00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:30.160 align:start position:0%
class or history class
 
00:15:31.269 --> 00:15:31.279 align:start position:0%
so i don't know if that answer i don't
 
00:15:31.279 --> 00:15:33.269 align:start position:0%
so i don't know if that answer i don't
know

00:15:33.269 --> 00:15:33.279 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:15:33.279 --> 00:15:35.030 align:start position:0%
know
yes

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
so i'm trying to think how to word it as
 
00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:38.240 align:start position:0%
a question
 
00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:40.240 align:start position:0%
i just see so often that we're carving
 
00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
out different
 
00:15:43.189 --> 00:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
different groups of students and it's
 
00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:44.720 align:start position:0%
not equitable
 
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
and my question is would you be open to
 
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
this bill being for all students so we
 
00:15:51.829 --> 00:15:51.839 align:start position:0%
teach all students the value of the i
 
00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
understand we have a citizenship test i
 
00:15:55.509 --> 00:15:55.519 align:start position:0%
don't remember how deep it goes
 
00:15:57.829 --> 00:15:57.839 align:start position:0%
but would you be open to
 
00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
we teach this to all students
 
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
yeah and i want i want to so so the
 
00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:04.720 align:start position:0%
second operative provision of the bill
 
00:16:06.629 --> 00:16:06.639 align:start position:0%
allows schools to do that and it gives
 
00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
them that authority and local control to
 
00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
do that so um you know if i
 
00:16:14.069 --> 00:16:14.079 align:start position:0%
i think in terms of um you know i
 
00:16:15.749 --> 00:16:15.759 align:start position:0%
understand the point about you know
 
00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
carve outs if you will it's my term not
 
00:16:19.509 --> 00:16:19.519 align:start position:0%
yours um
 
00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:21.680 align:start position:0%
it seems that this particular student
 
00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
population given given the history and
 
00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:26.079 align:start position:0%
poor treatment public schools have had
 
00:16:27.749 --> 00:16:27.759 align:start position:0%
with students with disabilities that
 
00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
certainly deserving of that of sort of a
 
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
special treatment but
 
00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean if schools want to do that
 
00:16:36.629 --> 00:16:36.639 align:start position:0%
or if we were to insist that all schools
 
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
do that
 
00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:38.870 align:start position:0%
do that
um

00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
yes that be agreeable and
 
00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
um the only thing i would ask is that
 
00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
and i would assume that this would be
 
00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:46.069 align:start position:0%
and i would assume that this would be
uh

00:16:46.069 --> 00:16:46.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:48.320 align:start position:0%
and i do codify it if this was to become
 
00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:50.320 align:start position:0%
law is that the accommodations that a
 
00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
child would need who is a student with
 
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
disabilities would be provided in that
 
00:16:55.269 --> 00:16:55.279 align:start position:0%
process of registering to vote if they
 
00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
if they're whatever it may be so yeah
 
00:16:59.269 --> 00:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
i have one question for you uh in your
 
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
second portion of the bill here in roman
 
00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:06.150 align:start position:0%
second portion of the bill here in roman
two

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
it speaks to all students on one or more
 
00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
days each academic year whereas uh i
 
00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
know in the district i have it's it's
 
00:17:15.669 --> 00:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
taught in
 
00:17:17.029 --> 00:17:17.039 align:start position:0%
civics class
 
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
at the that the high school level
 
00:17:21.189 --> 00:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
you take civics just once while you're
 
00:17:22.549 --> 00:17:22.559 align:start position:0%
in high school
 
00:17:22.559 --> 00:17:24.230 align:start position:0%
in high school
so

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:17:26.309 --> 00:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
it's being done but it's not being done
 
00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:28.720 align:start position:0%
every year but every student is required
 
00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
to have civics so it is being done for
 
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
all students
 
00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
but this
 
00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
is the way that this is worded would
 
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
that then eliminate the process that the
 
00:17:41.029 --> 00:17:41.039 align:start position:0%
some of these districts have chosen to
 
00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
do this
 
00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:46.240 align:start position:0%
uh if we incorporate it for all students
 
00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
as this says
 
00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:50.720 align:start position:0%
does your bill kind of uh
 
00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
re re-think or or have us rethink what's
 
00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:56.240 align:start position:0%
going on with how curriculum is managed
 
00:17:59.029 --> 00:17:59.039 align:start position:0%
locally in our districts
 
00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question um
 
00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
not necessarily i don't believe i i
 
00:18:05.909 --> 00:18:05.919 align:start position:0%
think the two things could could exist
 
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
at the same at the sign at the same time
 
00:18:09.669 --> 00:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
that the civics
 
00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
instruction could occur as you're
 
00:18:13.909 --> 00:18:13.919 align:start position:0%
describing it and a school could make uh
 
00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
good on
 
00:18:16.789 --> 00:18:16.799 align:start position:0%
roman two
 
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
in this bill uh and provide that for all
 
00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:22.480 align:start position:0%
it may spark a conversation about um you
 
00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
know how best to to proceed
 
00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
um at the local level
 
00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
if we were to do that would it not take
 
00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
some changing of how you worded it in
 
00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
um if we were to do
 
00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:40.240 align:start position:0%
through the civics class that's taught
 
00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
in the high school
 
00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:45.110 align:start position:0%
in the high school
potentially

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
potentially it could
 
00:18:48.789 --> 00:18:48.799 align:start position:0%
if i'm understanding the question
 
00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
correctly i think there's nothing that
 
00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:54.630 align:start position:0%
correctly i think there's nothing that
prohibits

00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:54.640 align:start position:0%
prohibits
 
00:18:58.150 --> 00:18:58.160 align:start position:0%
a civics class in addition to doing
 
00:18:59.590 --> 00:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
what they would do here and that's
 
00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
assuming that
 
00:19:03.029 --> 00:19:03.039 align:start position:0%
the school uh chose that they were going
 
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
to go with operative with uh roman two
 
00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
as opposed to sticking to roman one just
 
00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:10.240 align:start position:0%
in the special education process so
 
00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
potentially i suppose if we on a
 
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
case-by-case basis
 
00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
thank you language further questions
 
00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
representative nelson
 
00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
if a special ed student is going through
 
00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:26.240 align:start position:0%
the process for these extra years and
 
00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
they are
 
00:19:29.669 --> 00:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
very difficult
 
00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
problem they're severely handicapped
 
00:19:35.029 --> 00:19:35.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:35.039 --> 00:19:35.990 align:start position:0%
 
what

00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
how do you plan to work with those when
 
00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
maybe they could benefit from something
 
00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
from something else
 
00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
that might be more beneficial for their
 
00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um
 
00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:55.909 align:start position:0%
i think
that

00:19:55.909 --> 00:19:55.919 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:19:55.919 --> 00:20:01.190 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:03.440 align:start position:0%
as a matter of practice you know that
 
00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:05.200 align:start position:0%
that the bill only requires that a
 
00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
conversation happen at the at the iep
 
00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:09.200 align:start position:0%
table with the parents the child and the
 
00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
school officials about whether or not
 
00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:11.669 align:start position:0%
school officials about whether or not
registering

00:20:11.669 --> 00:20:11.679 align:start position:0%
registering
 
00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
um to to to vote would be appropriate so
 
00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
those case-by-case basis could be
 
00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
handled there
 
00:20:21.029 --> 00:20:21.039 align:start position:0%
but i think
 
00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
in my view
 
00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
i'm getting older
 
00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
but having seen how much progress we've
 
00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:29.190 align:start position:0%
but having seen how much progress we've
made

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:29.200 align:start position:0%
made
 
00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
removing barriers for children and
 
00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities in a short time
 
00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
i mean in the 1970s children with
 
00:20:41.029 --> 00:20:41.039 align:start position:0%
disabilities were
 
00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
wholesalely foreclosed from accessing a
 
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
public education so my hope
 
00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
would be that with that in mind and we
 
00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
have a lot more to do
 
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
uh no doubt um but but what my hope
 
00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
would be that with that in mind that
 
00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
those opportunities especially one
 
00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
um so important as a fundamental right
 
00:21:01.029 --> 00:21:01.039 align:start position:0%
to vote
 
00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
um and that as empowering as that can be
 
00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
for any of us um but particularly for
 
00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:08.549 align:start position:0%
for any of us um but particularly for
maybe

00:21:08.549 --> 00:21:08.559 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
00:21:08.559 --> 00:21:09.510 align:start position:0%
maybe
students

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh who who may not feel empowered and
 
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
and may be regular uh non-disabled
 
00:21:15.909 --> 00:21:15.919 align:start position:0%
children who are
 
00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:17.440 align:start position:0%
you know voting for the first time that
 
00:21:19.029 --> 00:21:19.039 align:start position:0%
they feel empowered wow i can make a
 
00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
difference but but with respect to
 
00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:22.240 align:start position:0%
students with disabilities my hope is
 
00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:23.029 align:start position:0%
students with disabilities my hope is
that

00:21:23.029 --> 00:21:23.039 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:21:23.039 --> 00:21:24.230 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
that that it would be
 
00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
recognize the significance of what
 
00:21:31.669 --> 00:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
voting would be um and at that
 
00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
conversation at that at that table with
 
00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
with the players there
 
00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
for the representative porter
 
00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:40.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:44.480 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm a little confused now
 
00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
the roman 2 section of your of the bill
 
00:21:51.909 --> 00:21:51.919 align:start position:0%
talks about in-school voter registration
 
00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
and that's a process that maybe the town
 
00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
clerk comes in and registers students
 
00:21:58.390 --> 00:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
it's not talking about a civics
 
00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
class am i right in that or am i wrong
 
00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
in that yes and i think thank you for
 
00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
the question and the bill does not touch
 
00:22:09.029 --> 00:22:09.039 align:start position:0%
a civic's curriculum or class or those
 
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
decisions there it just simply
 
00:22:13.669 --> 00:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
would call for an in-school voter
 
00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:17.200 align:start position:0%
registration not nothing in terms of the
 
00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
specific content about about
 
00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
civics or what that means
 
00:22:24.789 --> 00:22:24.799 align:start position:0%
no so that's a separate issue but thank
 
00:22:26.549 --> 00:22:26.559 align:start position:0%
you thank you for that question
 
00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli
 
00:22:30.149 --> 00:22:30.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
00:22:30.159 --> 00:22:31.350 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
representative

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:34.720 align:start position:0%
um i'm just wondering about your intent
 
00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
with lines 9 and 10 in roman 1
 
00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:40.710 align:start position:0%
with lines 9 and 10 in roman 1
um

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:40.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
what decisions are you talking about
 
00:22:46.549 --> 00:22:46.559 align:start position:0%
should be included in an iep plan
 
00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
so in in the iep plan process there's
 
00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
the prior to that in in the
 
00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
section within that section but above
 
00:22:56.549 --> 00:22:56.559 align:start position:0%
that sentence
 
00:22:59.430 --> 00:22:59.440 align:start position:0%
it describes um
 
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
bringing up the conversation about
 
00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
whether or not registration would be an
 
00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
appropriate goal and then the iep itself
 
00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
has grids for transition services so
 
00:23:12.549 --> 00:23:12.559 align:start position:0%
presumably if that was
 
00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
determined to be a reasonable goal
 
00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
for the child it would be in that and
 
00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
typically in my experience it would
 
00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:21.110 align:start position:0%
typically in my experience it would
explain

00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
explain
 
00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
what that meant so
 
00:23:23.909 --> 00:23:23.919 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
mom will take
 
00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
this child to
 
00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
town hall
 
00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
and and register to vote within the next
 
00:23:32.149 --> 00:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
year something along along lowe's
 
00:23:32.159 --> 00:23:33.190 align:start position:0%
year something along along lowe's
assuming

00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:33.200 align:start position:0%
assuming
 
00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
you know that that's what they determine
 
00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate appropriate goal
 
00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
so be codified in the plan itself
 
00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:44.240 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
not seeing any hands thank you very much
 
00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:47.200 align:start position:0%

00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
do you have a a button you can push
 
00:24:31.269 --> 00:24:31.279 align:start position:0%
there when it comes on red you're out
 
00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:33.200 align:start position:0%
here i'm on okay
 
00:24:35.029 --> 00:24:35.039 align:start position:0%
thank you for this opportunity to
 
00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
testify my name is liz tentarelli i'm
 
00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
president of the non-partisan league of
 
00:24:43.269 --> 00:24:43.279 align:start position:0%
women voters of new hampshire
 
00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:46.720 align:start position:0%
and we have been working on improving
 
00:24:48.789 --> 00:24:48.799 align:start position:0%
access to voting
 
00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
empowering voters for the last 102 years
 
00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
so i am here in support of this bill
 
00:24:59.750 --> 00:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
my written testimony talks about some
 
00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
specific things related to part two
 
00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
and that is where a school holds an
 
00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
in-person voter registration drive for
 
00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:11.029 align:start position:0%
in-person voter registration drive for
students

00:25:11.029 --> 00:25:11.039 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
in the last few years some of these have
 
00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
been held
 
00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
a league member organized in conway
 
00:25:20.549 --> 00:25:20.559 align:start position:0%
which is a regional school district and
 
00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:22.640 align:start position:0%
actually had supervisors of the
 
00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
checklist or town clerks
 
00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:28.480 align:start position:0%
from several towns right on site that's
 
00:25:31.269 --> 00:25:31.279 align:start position:0%
not easy to do you know we know that in
 
00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:34.240 align:start position:0%
regional school districts another league
 
00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
member who was a supervisor of the
 
00:25:38.789 --> 00:25:38.799 align:start position:0%
checklist in nashua offered a drive
 
00:25:38.799 --> 00:25:39.830 align:start position:0%
checklist in nashua offered a drive
there

00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
and recently a young person a student in
 
00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:45.750 align:start position:0%
and recently a young person a student in
laconia

00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
laconia
 
00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
organized this
 
00:25:50.549 --> 00:25:50.559 align:start position:0%
for the most part that doesn't happen so
 
00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
even young people without disabilities
 
00:25:56.710 --> 00:25:56.720 align:start position:0%
sometimes don't quite realize how they
 
00:25:58.789 --> 00:25:58.799 align:start position:0%
have to register
 
00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
what voting means what the procedures
 
00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:02.310 align:start position:0%
what voting means what the procedures
are

00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:04.720 align:start position:0%
that's particularly a problem for
 
00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
students with some disabilities
 
00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:10.240 align:start position:0%
for instance a blind student needs to
 
00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
know that we do have
 
00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
facilities at the polling place for
 
00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
students with visual impairments
 
00:26:20.149 --> 00:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
students who don't have driver's
 
00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
licenses and that includes both students
 
00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
with disabilities and those without for
 
00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:27.200 align:start position:0%
economic reasons
 
00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:29.440 align:start position:0%
need to know what they can do to get a
 
00:26:32.149 --> 00:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
voter id
 
00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:37.360 align:start position:0%
the non-driver voter id that applies
 
00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
for that reason the league publishes a
 
00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:42.400 align:start position:0%
lot of material both on its website and
 
00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:43.750 align:start position:0%
lot of material both on its website and
in

00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:26:45.909 --> 00:26:45.919 align:start position:0%
specific brochures
 
00:26:48.149 --> 00:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
to help people understand what the
 
00:26:49.909 --> 00:26:49.919 align:start position:0%
process is
 
00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:52.400 align:start position:0%
i think this is a wonderful bill
 
00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
to include this in the iep planning for
 
00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.190 align:start position:0%
to include this in the iep planning for
students

00:26:57.190 --> 00:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:27:00.149 --> 00:27:00.159 align:start position:0%
with disabilities so they understand the
 
00:27:00.159 --> 00:27:01.990 align:start position:0%
with disabilities so they understand the
accommodations

00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
accommodations
 
00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:04.240 align:start position:0%
that are available to them
 
00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
so that the parents will understand
 
00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
what those accommodations are and how
 
00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
they can get that young person
 
00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:12.789 align:start position:0%
they can get that young person
registered

00:27:12.789 --> 00:27:12.799 align:start position:0%
registered
 
00:27:15.909 --> 00:27:15.919 align:start position:0%
even if he or she can't drive
 
00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
can't get to the the polls or to the
 
00:27:20.389 --> 00:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
registration place
 
00:27:23.029 --> 00:27:23.039 align:start position:0%
so for those reasons the league heartily
 
00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
supports this
 
00:27:27.269 --> 00:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
we know that young people are the least
 
00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:31.360 align:start position:0%
likely group the 18 to 28 group is the
 
00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:35.440 align:start position:0%
least likely to vote in this country
 
00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
that's improving slightly over the over
 
00:27:39.029 --> 00:27:39.039 align:start position:0%
the last
 
00:27:41.269 --> 00:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
six years or so more of them are doing
 
00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
it and i just want to be sure that
 
00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:46.240 align:start position:0%
students with disabilities are included
 
00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
in that group
 
00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:50.320 align:start position:0%
of getting more interest in politics and
 
00:27:53.269 --> 00:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
knowing how they can become active
 
00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
members of it
 
00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
i'd be glad to take questions if you
 
00:27:58.950 --> 00:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
have any thank you very much liz
 
00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
represent hobson
 
00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:02.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question thank you for
 
00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
testifying today i was just wondering if
 
00:28:08.549 --> 00:28:08.559 align:start position:0%
you had tried any outreach to uh parents
 
00:28:11.269 --> 00:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
of children with disabilities no we have
 
00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:14.720 align:start position:0%
not not at this point we try to get
 
00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
someone in the schools
 
00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
to distribute our brochures our student
 
00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
age specific brochures about how to
 
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:28.480 align:start position:0%
you can't just bring them to the schools
 
00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
obviously there has to be somebody there
 
00:28:32.389 --> 00:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
actively doing it so we try to make
 
00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:34.480 align:start position:0%
contact with civics teachers for
 
00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:36.710 align:start position:0%
contact with civics teachers for
instance

00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
instance
 
00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:40.000 align:start position:0%
but no we have not so far reached out to
 
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
any specific
 
00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:42.870 align:start position:0%
any specific
student

00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
student
 
00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:45.200 align:start position:0%
disabilities groups it's a good idea
 
00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
though thank you for that
 
00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
might be a
 
00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:50.320 align:start position:0%
confidentiality issue associated with
 
00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:52.480 align:start position:0%
that you're not going to get names no no
 
00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
no i didn't i did not intend that i
 
00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
meant that we provide materials that
 
00:28:58.950 --> 00:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
they could then distribute to students
 
00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:00.640 align:start position:0%
that's the way to do it yes further
 
00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:02.710 align:start position:0%
that's the way to do it yes further

00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
students with disabilities for
 
00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
further employment further education in

learning how to be a responsible adult

age 16
 
00:29:59.669 --> 00:29:59.679 align:start position:0%
to include transition goals and the

goal is to prepare that student for
adulthood

00:30:04.149 --> 00:30:04.159 align:start position:0%
adulthood
 
00:30:06.149 --> 00:30:06.159 align:start position:0%
and when the student reaches the age of
 
00:30:08.389 --> 00:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
17 so one year before they reach the age
 
00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
of majority the iep has to include a
 
00:30:13.029 --> 00:30:13.039 align:start position:0%
statement stating that the child has
 
00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:15.200 align:start position:0%
been informed of what rights under idea
 
00:30:17.029 --> 00:30:17.039 align:start position:0%
will transfer to them upon their
 
00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
reaching the age of majority
 
00:30:21.029 --> 00:30:21.039 align:start position:0%
discussing voter registration as an
 
00:30:22.389 --> 00:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
appropriate community living and
 
00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
citizenship training goal to be included
 
00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:27.520 align:start position:0%
in the iep or 504 plan seems like a
 
00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:29.360 align:start position:0%
logical companion to informing the
 
00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
student of what special education rights
 
00:30:34.149 --> 00:30:34.159 align:start position:0%
will transfer to them at age 18.
 
00:30:35.909 --> 00:30:35.919 align:start position:0%
on a personal level i'm the parent of an
 
00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
adult son with disabilities sean has
 
00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
down syndrome and a mitochondrial
 
00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:40.950 align:start position:0%
down syndrome and a mitochondrial
disorder

00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
disorder
 
00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:41.750 align:start position:0%
disorder
and

00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
i know that voting is an important part
 
00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
of his identity as a responsible adult
 
00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
sean knows who doesn't vote children and
 
00:30:50.549 --> 00:30:50.559 align:start position:0%
people who don't care and he knows that
 
00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
he is neither of those people
 
00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
when sean was born people with
 
00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
disabilities were not expected to go to
 
00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:57.590 align:start position:0%
disabilities were not expected to go to
school

00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
they were not expected to get jobs or
 
00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
contribute to their communities
 
00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:05.200 align:start position:0%
he does he did go to school
 
00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
he has a job he's had it for 20 years
 
00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
since he finished school
 
00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:10.960 align:start position:0%
and he takes the civic duties very
 
00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
responsibly he volunteers he votes and
 
00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:14.480 align:start position:0%
he recycles
 
00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:16.240 align:start position:0%
we take careful steps to ensure that he
 
00:31:18.389 --> 00:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
can make informed choices that means
 
00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:20.480 align:start position:0%
reading candidates websites and campaign
 
00:31:22.789 --> 00:31:22.799 align:start position:0%
campaign literature and he goes to
 
00:31:24.549 --> 00:31:24.559 align:start position:0%
events and asks questions about things
 
00:31:26.389 --> 00:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
that matter to him he's never missed
 
00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
voting in an election even when he woke
 
00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
up with pneumonia he insisted that he
 
00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
had to vote before we went to the
 
00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:33.669 align:start position:0%
had to vote before we went to the
hospital

00:31:33.669 --> 00:31:33.679 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
we took sean to register when he turned
 
00:31:37.669 --> 00:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
18 just as we did to his sister with his
 
00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
sister but i know that not every parent
 
00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:42.640 align:start position:0%
votes i also know that
 
00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:44.480 align:start position:0%
parents sometimes have been
 
00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:46.640 align:start position:0%
given the impression that their children
 
00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
have such low abilities the culture of
 
00:31:51.669 --> 00:31:51.679 align:start position:0%
low expectations that they may not even
 
00:31:53.909 --> 00:31:53.919 align:start position:0%
consider that their student their child
 
00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
would want to vote or be able to neither
 
00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
of those are true
 
00:31:58.950 --> 00:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
this bill treats students with
 
00:32:01.669 --> 00:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
disabilities as responsible adults by
 
00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
compelling the iep team which includes
 
00:32:05.509 --> 00:32:05.519 align:start position:0%
the youth with a disability beginning by
 
00:32:07.269 --> 00:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
age 16
 
00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
to discuss the student registering to
 
00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:11.039 align:start position:0%
vote and about how they would accomplish
 
00:32:11.039 --> 00:32:11.909 align:start position:0%
vote and about how they would accomplish
that

00:32:11.909 --> 00:32:11.919 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
00:32:14.549 --> 00:32:14.559 align:start position:0%
great bill and i encourage you to
 
00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
support it
 
00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much bonnie are there
 
00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:20.240 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
not seeing any hands thank you very much
 
00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:32.789 --> 00:32:32.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:33.909 --> 00:32:33.919 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:32:36.389 --> 00:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
i'm karen rosenberg i am the new policy
 
00:32:38.549 --> 00:32:38.559 align:start position:0%
director at the disability rights center
 
00:32:41.269 --> 00:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
prior to becoming the policy director i
 
00:32:43.509 --> 00:32:43.519 align:start position:0%
represented students and parents of
 
00:32:45.509 --> 00:32:45.519 align:start position:0%
students with disabilities in special
 
00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:47.440 align:start position:0%
education matters and i'm here to
 
00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
encourage you to support house bill 1594
 
00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
which as you know would basically use
 
00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:56.240 align:start position:0%
our existing iep and 504 infrastructure
 
00:32:58.549 --> 00:32:58.559 align:start position:0%
to include a discussion about in
 
00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
transition planning um about whether it
 
00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
makes sense for a student to register to
 
00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:04.389 align:start position:0%
makes sense for a student to register to
vote

00:33:04.389 --> 00:33:04.399 align:start position:0%
vote
 
00:33:04.399 --> 00:33:05.590 align:start position:0%
vote
and

00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:33:07.669 --> 00:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
as bonnie mentioned the purpose of the
 
00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
individuals with disabilities act idea
 
00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:12.640 align:start position:0%
is to prepare our students to become
 
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
independent employed and fully engaged
 
00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:16.310 align:start position:0%
independent employed and fully engaged
citizens

00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
00:33:18.789 --> 00:33:18.799 align:start position:0%
the focus of idea is to educate our
 
00:33:20.149 --> 00:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
students in the least restrictive
 
00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
environment with their peers so that
 
00:33:24.149 --> 00:33:24.159 align:start position:0%
they can be part of the school community
 
00:33:26.789 --> 00:33:26.799 align:start position:0%
and part of the larger community
 
00:33:29.909 --> 00:33:29.919 align:start position:0%
voting is essential to citizenship in
 
00:33:32.149 --> 00:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
this country it is one of the privileges
 
00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
we all enjoy
 
00:33:36.389 --> 00:33:36.399 align:start position:0%
and it's one that it comes with some
 
00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and so
 
00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:39.909 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and so
using

00:33:39.909 --> 00:33:39.919 align:start position:0%
using
 
00:33:43.509 --> 00:33:43.519 align:start position:0%
the ied i um the iep process
 
00:33:43.519 --> 00:33:44.310 align:start position:0%
the ied i um the iep process
and

00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:46.640 align:start position:0%
the 504 meetings as an opportunity to
 
00:33:49.269 --> 00:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
help further prepare students to be
 
00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:51.440 align:start position:0%
civically engaged independent adults
 
00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
makes a lot of sense
 
00:33:56.389 --> 00:33:56.399 align:start position:0%
it would be great if our schools
 
00:33:56.399 --> 00:33:57.350 align:start position:0%
it would be great if our schools
would

00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
include this kind of discussion in for
 
00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
all of our students i think
 
00:34:03.269 --> 00:34:03.279 align:start position:0%
representative litchfield you asked
 
00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
about that i know from um it's been a
 
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
little while since my kids were in high
 
00:34:08.950 --> 00:34:08.960 align:start position:0%
school they took civics i think it was
 
00:34:12.149 --> 00:34:12.159 align:start position:0%
in ninth or tenth grade and um so they
 
00:34:14.149 --> 00:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
weren't really close to being of age to
 
00:34:16.389 --> 00:34:16.399 align:start position:0%
register one and also students with
 
00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
disabilities may require some supports
 
00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
that students without disabilities don't
 
00:34:23.669 --> 00:34:23.679 align:start position:0%
require in terms of figuring out how to
 
00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
register and maybe getting some support
 
00:34:26.950 --> 00:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:28.869 align:start position:0%
to do that
so

00:34:28.869 --> 00:34:28.879 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
yes it's important for all of our
 
00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:32.240 align:start position:0%
students our job
 
00:34:34.389 --> 00:34:34.399 align:start position:0%
is to our school's job is to prepare all
 
00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
of our students to be productive
 
00:34:39.589 --> 00:34:39.599 align:start position:0%
independent engaged adults um students
 
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
with disabilities may just need a little
 
00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
bit of extra time and assistance with
 
00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:45.270 align:start position:0%
bit of extra time and assistance with
that

00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:46.720 align:start position:0%
and also just so you know a lot of
 
00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
schools do this already
 
00:34:51.669 --> 00:34:51.679 align:start position:0%
there are model materials that schools
 
00:34:53.109 --> 00:34:53.119 align:start position:0%
use to
 
00:34:55.589 --> 00:34:55.599 align:start position:0%
undergo transition planning for students
 
00:34:57.510 --> 00:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
with disabilities and a lot of those
 
00:34:59.670 --> 00:34:59.680 align:start position:0%
model materials include discussions
 
00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:00.950 align:start position:0%
model materials include discussions
about

00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:02.720 align:start position:0%
like a checklist have you discussed how
 
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
to get an id in states like ours that
 
00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
requires identification to vote um have
 
00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
you discussed voter registration so some
 
00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
of those things are already in the
 
00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
curriculum and in
 
00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
materials that iep teams use this would
 
00:35:17.589 --> 00:35:17.599 align:start position:0%
really standardize it and make sure that
 
00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
all of our students with disabilities
 
00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:22.240 align:start position:0%
have those discussions and are afforded
 
00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
this opportunity so thank you for what i
 
00:35:27.109 --> 00:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
hope will be your support of this bill
 
00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to take any questions you
 
00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
might have thank you very much questions
 
00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
do you have access to these model
 
00:35:37.349 --> 00:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
materials that we you know maybe a best
 
00:35:40.069 --> 00:35:40.079 align:start position:0%
practice that could be embedded within
 
00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
our instruction at the high schools
 
00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
right now so there are materials all
 
00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
online in fact i think the depart u.s
 
00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
department of education has a link to
 
00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
materials on transition planning but um
 
00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
the parent information center i believe
 
00:35:56.069 --> 00:35:56.079 align:start position:0%
has a link to information on transition
 
00:35:58.630 --> 00:35:58.640 align:start position:0%
planning i'd be happy to share some of
 
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
that with you if you want me to collate
 
00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
it but there's so much there's a lot out
 
00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
there that's okay i think i know that
 
00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
our life skills teachers do a lot of
 
00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:08.640 align:start position:0%
this but that's just one portion of the
 
00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
iep whole process right so thank you

okay welcome good morning

00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:35.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
i'm kathleen cintavi from dover new
 
00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire and i'm a lifelong educator
 
00:36:45.589 --> 00:36:45.599 align:start position:0%
and i have sat in on many 504 and iep
 
00:36:45.599 --> 00:36:46.710 align:start position:0%
and i have sat in on many 504 and iep
plans

00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:46.720 align:start position:0%
plans
 
00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
and i can tell you that they are very
 
00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
complex with a lot involved in there
 
00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
many of our iep and 504 students are
 
00:36:59.670 --> 00:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
mainstream they are in regular education
 
00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
classes as much as fits in with their
 
00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
iep they may have an aid with them in
 
00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
that class to help them to understand
 
00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
what is going on
 
00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
in that class so
 
00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:17.200 align:start position:0%
they should be by and large exposed to
 
00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:18.630 align:start position:0%
they should be by and large exposed to
this

00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:18.640 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
but do keep in mind there there is a
 
00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
wide variety of disabilities
 
00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:24.790 align:start position:0%
wide variety of disabilities
and

00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
some students
 
00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
because of their disability may actually
 
00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
have a difficulty in truly understanding
 
00:37:36.310 --> 00:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
the voting process and selecting the
 
00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:37.510 align:start position:0%
the voting process and selecting the
person

00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
who would best meet their particular
 
00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:42.710 align:start position:0%
who would best meet their particular
needs

00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
needs
 
00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:43.670 align:start position:0%
needs
but

00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
part of voting is to register to vote
 
00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:48.150 align:start position:0%
part of voting is to register to vote
and

00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:50.240 align:start position:0%
i think that as we're trying to
 
00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
mainstream our students it is probably
 
00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:56.720 align:start position:0%
in their best interest for them to do
 
00:38:00.310 --> 00:38:00.320 align:start position:0%
this as the general population does this
 
00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:02.960 align:start position:0%
by bringing in documentation
 
00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
proof of residence a birth certificate a
 
00:38:07.829 --> 00:38:07.839 align:start position:0%
picture id
 
00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of opportunities to
 
00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
register at city or town halls also on
 
00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
the date of voting and i have registered
 
00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
people in dover personally and i can
 
00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
tell you that any help or support that
 
00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
is needed
 
00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
for anyone who comes in to register we
 
00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
do that
 
00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:32.720 align:start position:0%
for several years i helped to register
 
00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:35.680 align:start position:0%
people for instance in a nursing home
 
00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
who were at all various levels of
 
00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
understanding and we helped each and
 
00:38:43.829 --> 00:38:43.839 align:start position:0%
every one of them so in regards to
 
00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:46.720 align:start position:0%
actually registering to vote i believe
 
00:38:50.310 --> 00:38:50.320 align:start position:0%
that in general there is a lot of help
 
00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
available there
 
00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
but part of what we want all of our
 
00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
students whether they have an iep a 504
 
00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
plan or anything else we want them to
 
00:39:03.109 --> 00:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
all learn rights and responsibilities
 
00:39:05.589 --> 00:39:05.599 align:start position:0%
and how to practice them
 
00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
and fortunately we also have parents to
 
00:39:11.589 --> 00:39:11.599 align:start position:0%
help support this undertaking
 
00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
and i just hesitate to see parental
 
00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
rights further erode and give more and
 
00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
more responsibility to our schools
 
00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
teachers are quite overwhelmed very
 
00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
often with all the responsibilities that
 
00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
they have at present
 
00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
and adding one more thing like this
 
00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
and making it a requirement i'm not sure
 
00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
is the best way
 
00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
to go i would i would like us to make
 
00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:44.960 align:start position:0%
sure if this does pass
 
00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
that the parents understand their role
 
00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
and all of this and their rights and
 
00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and that here in new
 
00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:54.630 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and that here in new
hampshire

00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:54.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
we remain
 
00:39:59.030 --> 00:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
a state that
 
00:40:01.829 --> 00:40:01.839 align:start position:0%
recognizes the rights responsibilities
 
00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
not only of the child but of the parent
 
00:40:07.589 --> 00:40:07.599 align:start position:0%
as well and we do not acquiesce to
 
00:40:07.599 --> 00:40:08.630 align:start position:0%
as well and we do not acquiesce to
giving

00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
giving
 
00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
more and more responsibilities to our
 
00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:12.470 align:start position:0%
more and more responsibilities to our
schools

00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:40:15.829 --> 00:40:15.839 align:start position:0%
you know we lose control over what's
 
00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:18.880 align:start position:0%
going on in our schools it's very hard
 
00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
for instance in the city of dover the
 
00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
public is not welcome in the school so
 
00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
we couldn't even go in and visit a class
 
00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
to see
 
00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
what's going on in a civics class or
 
00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
anything else so i think we need to
 
00:40:38.069 --> 00:40:38.079 align:start position:0%
tread cautiously
 
00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
as we approach
 
00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:42.240 align:start position:0%

community i just am confused whether you
 
00:40:59.510 --> 00:40:59.520 align:start position:0%

00:41:02.790 --> 00:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
bill um i am not supporting all the
 
00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:04.640 align:start position:0%
parts of this bill
 
00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:08.480 align:start position:0%

believe that we need to let civic
 
00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:18.069 align:start position:0%
believe that we need to let civic
responsibilities

00:41:18.069 --> 00:41:18.079 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
 
00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:20.720 align:start position:0%
be civic responsibility and not bring
 
00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:25.200 align:start position:0%

good morning and thank you mr chairman

for the record my name is peter teroshan
 
00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
i represent the
 
00:48:45.510 --> 00:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
rockingham county district 14 which is
 
00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
the towns of atkinson and blasto
 
00:48:51.430 --> 00:48:51.440 align:start position:0%
i'm here today as the prime sponsor of
 
00:48:55.829 --> 00:48:55.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:57.910 --> 00:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
and i'm asking you to
 
00:49:00.309 --> 00:49:00.319 align:start position:0%
consider passage of this legislation
 
00:49:02.470 --> 00:49:02.480 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is prevent prohibits
 
00:49:05.109 --> 00:49:05.119 align:start position:0%
higher education institutions
 
00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:08.640 align:start position:0%
that take new hampshire taxpayer
 
00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:09.670 align:start position:0%
that take new hampshire taxpayer
funds

00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:49:12.069 --> 00:49:12.079 align:start position:0%
from requiring a coven 19 vaccination or
 
00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:16.240 align:start position:0%
face mass for enrollment or attendance
 
00:49:19.829 --> 00:49:19.839 align:start position:0%
so there's times that people enroll
 
00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:22.240 align:start position:0%
in a university particularly these days
 
00:49:24.549 --> 00:49:24.559 align:start position:0%
with technology where they may not even
 
00:49:27.190 --> 00:49:27.200 align:start position:0%
have an in-person class or it may be a
 
00:49:29.109 --> 00:49:29.119 align:start position:0%
small class where there's certainly
 
00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
plenty of room for
 
00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:33.030 align:start position:0%
plenty of room for
instructors

00:49:33.030 --> 00:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
instructors
 
00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:35.270 align:start position:0%
instructors
to

00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
exercise a six-foot
 
00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:40.160 align:start position:0%
rule that we've come to know
 
00:49:44.230 --> 00:49:44.240 align:start position:0%
very well the last couple of years
 
00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
we we now have
 
00:49:48.790 --> 00:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
data on the transmission of cover 19
 
00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
particularly the delta and omnicron
 
00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:52.069 align:start position:0%
particularly the delta and omnicron
variants

00:49:52.069 --> 00:49:52.079 align:start position:0%
variants
 
00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:56.069 --> 00:49:56.079 align:start position:0%
seems that there is a very similar
 
00:49:57.430 --> 00:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
transmission rate now between the
 
00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and non-vaccinated uh
 
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:01.190 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and non-vaccinated uh
folks

00:50:01.190 --> 00:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
folks
 
00:50:03.829 --> 00:50:03.839 align:start position:0%
in fact i do some part-time work for a
 
00:50:03.839 --> 00:50:05.270 align:start position:0%
in fact i do some part-time work for a
retail

00:50:05.270 --> 00:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
retail
 
00:50:07.430 --> 00:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
company down in salem
 
00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:08.640 align:start position:0%
we're about
 
00:50:11.109 --> 00:50:11.119 align:start position:0%
95 percent of the people
 
00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
probably even higher than that or
 
00:50:15.829 --> 00:50:15.839 align:start position:0%
vaccinated in the facility
 
00:50:15.839 --> 00:50:17.750 align:start position:0%
vaccinated in the facility
and

00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:50:19.829 --> 00:50:19.839 align:start position:0%
recently somebody this was back in
 
00:50:19.839 --> 00:50:21.829 align:start position:0%
recently somebody this was back in
november

00:50:21.829 --> 00:50:21.839 align:start position:0%
november
 
00:50:23.829 --> 00:50:23.839 align:start position:0%
was out because they found out they
 
00:50:25.349 --> 00:50:25.359 align:start position:0%
tested positive
 
00:50:27.430 --> 00:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
for covid
 
00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:29.190 align:start position:0%
for covid
everybody

00:50:29.190 --> 00:50:29.200 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:30.230 align:start position:0%
everybody
there

00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:50:32.309 --> 00:50:32.319 align:start position:0%
with only one exception whether they
 
00:50:35.670 --> 00:50:35.680 align:start position:0%
were vaccinated not vaccinated
 
00:50:37.510 --> 00:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
came down with covert
 
00:50:39.589 --> 00:50:39.599 align:start position:0%
the only person that didn't
 
00:50:41.430 --> 00:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
did have covert
 
00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:42.309 align:start position:0%
did have covert
um

00:50:42.309 --> 00:50:42.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:44.790 --> 00:50:44.800 align:start position:0%
initially in 2020
 
00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:46.470 align:start position:0%
initially in 2020
and

00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:50:48.069 --> 00:50:48.079 align:start position:0%
he did not
 
00:50:48.079 --> 00:50:49.589 align:start position:0%
he did not
get

00:50:49.589 --> 00:50:49.599 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:50:52.829 --> 00:50:52.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:55.670 --> 00:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
virus how was the outcome for people it
 
00:50:57.190 --> 00:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
was all over the place but there were
 
00:50:59.030 --> 00:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
many that weren't vaccinated that
 
00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
actually um
 
00:51:02.549 --> 00:51:02.559 align:start position:0%
recovered quicker than those that were
 
00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
so there didn't seem to be an
 
00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
appreciable difference one will never
 
00:51:09.030 --> 00:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
know but anyway
 
00:51:10.710 --> 00:51:10.720 align:start position:0%
i only mention that because we do have
 
00:51:12.549 --> 00:51:12.559 align:start position:0%
data now and
 
00:51:14.549 --> 00:51:14.559 align:start position:0%
we do um there are
 
00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
you know options that schools can use
 
00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:17.910 align:start position:0%
you know options that schools can use
um

00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:20.790 --> 00:51:20.800 align:start position:0%
with six foot spacing this this
 
00:51:22.950 --> 00:51:22.960 align:start position:0%
legislation doesn't prohibit them from
 
00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
putting up shields or barriers
 
00:51:27.750 --> 00:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh and um again there's times that you
 
00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
are taking a remote class you're
 
00:51:31.510 --> 00:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
enrolled but you're not necessarily in a
 
00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
classroom closer than six feet to other
 
00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:36.710 align:start position:0%
classroom closer than six feet to other
students

00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:36.720 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:51:38.790 --> 00:51:38.800 align:start position:0%
one of my concerns with the with the way
 
00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:40.640 align:start position:0%
things are done currently is that i
 
00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
believe that by requiring uh
 
00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:44.640 align:start position:0%
particularly a
 
00:51:47.109 --> 00:51:47.119 align:start position:0%
vaccine i'll use the word passport to
 
00:51:49.589 --> 00:51:49.599 align:start position:0%
enroll and attend is you're singling out
 
00:51:51.910 --> 00:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
you're creating a class you're dividing
 
00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:52.790 align:start position:0%
you're creating a class you're dividing
people

00:51:52.790 --> 00:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:51:56.150 --> 00:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't take into consideration uh
 
00:51:56.160 --> 00:51:57.670 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't take into consideration uh
what

00:51:57.670 --> 00:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:51:57.680 --> 00:51:58.950 align:start position:0%
what
the

00:51:58.950 --> 00:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:52:01.349 --> 00:52:01.359 align:start position:0%
admissions people usually look at
 
00:52:03.829 --> 00:52:03.839 align:start position:0%
the students
 
00:52:05.589 --> 00:52:05.599 align:start position:0%
background and so forth it simply says
 
00:52:07.109 --> 00:52:07.119 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter none of that matters
 
00:52:08.470 --> 00:52:08.480 align:start position:0%
if you're not vaccinated you can't
 
00:52:10.549 --> 00:52:10.559 align:start position:0%
enroll so that that's concerning i
 
00:52:11.630 --> 00:52:11.640 align:start position:0%
believe it's
 
00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:13.190 align:start position:0%
believe it's
discriminatory

00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
discriminatory
 
00:52:15.030 --> 00:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
and also there are students who are
 
00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
elected to go to in to other
 
00:52:18.870 --> 00:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
universities in other states where they
 
00:52:20.150 --> 00:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
don't do this
 
00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:21.440 align:start position:0%
and they leave it up to individual
 
00:52:22.549 --> 00:52:22.559 align:start position:0%
choice which at the end of the day i
 
00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
believe it should be
 
00:52:26.390 --> 00:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
and so there's an economic
 
00:52:28.069 --> 00:52:28.079 align:start position:0%
potential economic loss there as well
 
00:52:30.790 --> 00:52:30.800 align:start position:0%
from students that we end up uh losing
 
00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:37.910 --> 00:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
the other in an important issue here is
 
00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:40.390 align:start position:0%
the other in an important issue here is
that

00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:41.829 --> 00:52:41.839 align:start position:0%
the vaccine
 
00:52:43.270 --> 00:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
you know how
 
00:52:45.670 --> 00:52:45.680 align:start position:0%
much have we seen on the various
 
00:52:48.549 --> 00:52:48.559 align:start position:0%
vaccines and their effectiveness that
 
00:52:48.559 --> 00:52:49.430 align:start position:0%
vaccines and their effectiveness that
was

00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
i'll use the word promised it ended up
 
00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
being the case so there's a lot we still
 
00:52:54.630 --> 00:52:54.640 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:55.589 align:start position:0%
don't know
and

00:52:55.589 --> 00:52:55.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:52:57.430 --> 00:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
the so-called experts have changed their
 
00:53:00.309 --> 00:53:00.319 align:start position:0%
mind and opinions on much of this and at
 
00:53:02.470 --> 00:53:02.480 align:start position:0%
the end of the day it's still
 
00:53:03.910 --> 00:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
a very
 
00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:06.069 align:start position:0%
a very
new

00:53:06.069 --> 00:53:06.079 align:start position:0%
new
 
00:53:08.470 --> 00:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
vaccine that we don't know the long-term
 
00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:10.720 align:start position:0%
effects on and more and more you know
 
00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
i'm reading information from
 
00:53:15.910 --> 00:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
the u.s army that keeps data there's
 
00:53:18.309 --> 00:53:18.319 align:start position:0%
they're seeing now in vaccinated people
 
00:53:19.750 --> 00:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
there was a couple whistleblowers came
 
00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:20.710 align:start position:0%
there was a couple whistleblowers came
forward

00:53:20.710 --> 00:53:20.720 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:53:22.790 --> 00:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
an increased rate in cancers and in
 
00:53:25.030 --> 00:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
other afflictions now it's too early to
 
00:53:27.109 --> 00:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
tell you know exactly what there but
 
00:53:30.549 --> 00:53:30.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
i would never fault and i don't think i
 
00:53:34.150 --> 00:53:34.160 align:start position:0%
should we should discriminate against
 
00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
somebody who is concerned about their
 
00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:37.270 align:start position:0%
somebody who is concerned about their
health

00:53:37.270 --> 00:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
health
 
00:53:38.950 --> 00:53:38.960 align:start position:0%
and about any long-term effect they may
 
00:53:40.069 --> 00:53:40.079 align:start position:0%
have from
 
00:53:42.549 --> 00:53:42.559 align:start position:0%
the vaccination and or fertility
 
00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
potential fertility issues
 
00:53:47.829 --> 00:53:47.839 align:start position:0%
and for all those reasons i believe that
 
00:53:50.950 --> 00:53:50.960 align:start position:0%
this should be an individual choice
 
00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:51.829 align:start position:0%
this should be an individual choice
uh

00:53:51.829 --> 00:53:51.839 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
universities and colleges are certainly
 
00:53:54.829 --> 00:53:54.839 align:start position:0%
free to
 
00:53:58.549 --> 00:53:58.559 align:start position:0%
to use other means to
 
00:54:00.549 --> 00:54:00.559 align:start position:0%
enforce social distancing if they
 
00:54:01.990 --> 00:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
believe that makes a difference when it
 
00:54:03.349 --> 00:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
comes to mass
 
00:54:04.630 --> 00:54:04.640 align:start position:0%
we've seen that
 
00:54:07.670 --> 00:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
again at the retail establishment
 
00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
everybody's wearing a mask
 
00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:12.400 align:start position:0%
all the time in there and again it it it
 
00:54:14.069 --> 00:54:14.079 align:start position:0%
spreads so
 
00:54:15.510 --> 00:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
some of these things that maybe make us
 
00:54:18.069 --> 00:54:18.079 align:start position:0%
feel good and again i i don't let me
 
00:54:19.829 --> 00:54:19.839 align:start position:0%
back up and say it's an individual
 
00:54:21.990 --> 00:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
choice and i respect any choice somebody
 
00:54:23.829 --> 00:54:23.839 align:start position:0%
makes but again i believe at the end of
 
00:54:25.109 --> 00:54:25.119 align:start position:0%
the day it should be the individual's
 
00:54:25.119 --> 00:54:26.069 align:start position:0%
the day it should be the individual's
choice

00:54:26.069 --> 00:54:26.079 align:start position:0%
choice
 
00:54:26.079 --> 00:54:27.190 align:start position:0%
choice
not

00:54:27.190 --> 00:54:27.200 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:29.270 align:start position:0%
not
um

00:54:29.270 --> 00:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:31.270 --> 00:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
a college or university not the state
 
00:54:33.589 --> 00:54:33.599 align:start position:0%
government i believe it should be up to
 
00:54:35.750 --> 00:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
the individual and we could particularly
 
00:54:38.470 --> 00:54:38.480 align:start position:0%
with what we know now i think we can do
 
00:54:41.589 --> 00:54:41.599 align:start position:0%
that in a way that does not
 
00:54:42.950 --> 00:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
really change
 
00:54:45.190 --> 00:54:45.200 align:start position:0%
the the final outcome
 
00:54:46.470 --> 00:54:46.480 align:start position:0%
many states
 
00:54:48.549 --> 00:54:48.559 align:start position:0%
have elected to go different ways during
 
00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
the pandemic at the end of the day if
 
00:54:53.510 --> 00:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
you look at data it it comes down to
 
00:54:54.950 --> 00:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
pretty much we're all in kind of in the
 
00:54:56.630 --> 00:54:56.640 align:start position:0%
same spot
 
00:54:59.109 --> 00:54:59.119 align:start position:0%
between the beginning and now
 
00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
some places have suffered more
 
00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:02.870 align:start position:0%
some places have suffered more
economically

00:55:02.870 --> 00:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
economically
 
00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
and there's been plenty of um increase
 
00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:07.589 align:start position:0%
and there's been plenty of um increase
of

00:55:07.589 --> 00:55:07.599 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:55:09.270 --> 00:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
particularly in the student population
 
00:55:10.470 --> 00:55:10.480 align:start position:0%
of people that are suffering from
 
00:55:12.470 --> 00:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
depression and suicide rates have gone
 
00:55:14.630 --> 00:55:14.640 align:start position:0%
up so that's a that's a is a byproduct
 
00:55:15.750 --> 00:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
of all of this
 
00:55:19.030 --> 00:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
so anyway to kind of wrap up my
 
00:55:21.430 --> 00:55:21.440 align:start position:0%
my um testimony here
 
00:55:25.349 --> 00:55:25.359 align:start position:0%
um particularly where this targets
 
00:55:27.829 --> 00:55:27.839 align:start position:0%
higher education institutions that take
 
00:55:30.470 --> 00:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
state money i believe
 
00:55:31.750 --> 00:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
if they're taking state money they
 
00:55:34.150 --> 00:55:34.160 align:start position:0%
should be very careful that they don't
 
00:55:36.789 --> 00:55:36.799 align:start position:0%
create classes and discriminate against
 
00:55:38.710 --> 00:55:38.720 align:start position:0%
people that elect not to take the
 
00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:41.910 align:start position:0%
people that elect not to take the
vaccine

00:55:41.910 --> 00:55:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
i thank you for listening today i hope
 
00:55:46.710 --> 00:55:46.720 align:start position:0%
you consider not to pass motion on house
 
00:55:48.549 --> 00:55:48.559 align:start position:0%
bill 12
 
00:55:50.950 --> 00:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
33 this concludes my
 
00:55:52.630 --> 00:55:52.640 align:start position:0%
testimony and i would be glad to answer
 
00:55:54.549 --> 00:55:54.559 align:start position:0%
any questions that you may have thank
 
00:55:56.390 --> 00:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
you very much representative are there
 
00:55:59.430 --> 00:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:00.829 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
representative

00:56:00.829 --> 00:56:00.839 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:56:03.430 --> 00:56:03.440 align:start position:0%
tanner thank you mr chair and thank you
 
00:56:05.190 --> 00:56:05.200 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
00:56:07.270 --> 00:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
i was wondering if you could succinctly
 
00:56:09.109 --> 00:56:09.119 align:start position:0%
in in a sentence or two just say what
 
00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:10.480 align:start position:0%
your intent
 
00:56:15.990 --> 00:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
as succinctly as i can the intent um
 
00:56:22.390 --> 00:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
which i did speak to is to ensure that
 
00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:23.589 align:start position:0%
which i did speak to is to ensure that
students

00:56:23.589 --> 00:56:23.599 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:56:25.109 --> 00:56:25.119 align:start position:0%
every student
 
00:56:27.750 --> 00:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
irregardless of their vaccine status
 
00:56:32.309 --> 00:56:32.319 align:start position:0%
has the right to attend a state funded
 
00:56:35.109 --> 00:56:35.119 align:start position:0%
high institution
 
00:56:35.119 --> 00:56:36.230 align:start position:0%
high institution
and

00:56:36.230 --> 00:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:56:39.109 --> 00:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
but it's that simple
 
00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:40.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:56:43.270 --> 00:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock
 
00:56:45.109 --> 00:56:45.119 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman ladd thank you
 
00:56:46.230 --> 00:56:46.240 align:start position:0%
uh representative thank you for taking
 
00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
my question i just want to get clarity
 
00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:50.960 align:start position:0%
on a statement i thought i heard you say
 
00:56:52.710 --> 00:56:52.720 align:start position:0%
uh i thought i heard you say a moment
 
00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
ago that
 
00:56:57.030 --> 00:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh the mass and the vaccinations
 
00:56:59.829 --> 00:56:59.839 align:start position:0%
this bill um
 
00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
is um
 
00:57:04.309 --> 00:57:04.319 align:start position:0%
has been part and parcel basically of
 
00:57:07.109 --> 00:57:07.119 align:start position:0%
increasing the suicide rate
 
00:57:09.270 --> 00:57:09.280 align:start position:0%
and and you were talking
 
00:57:11.589 --> 00:57:11.599 align:start position:0%
after army stats uh
 
00:57:13.030 --> 00:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
and everything i've read about the
 
00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
increased suicide rates
 
00:57:17.510 --> 00:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
has not been a reflection of masking or
 
00:57:19.829 --> 00:57:19.839 align:start position:0%
vaccinations but rather the isolation
 
00:57:22.390 --> 00:57:22.400 align:start position:0%
and loneliness of remote learning
 
00:57:24.470 --> 00:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
so i i was wondering how you where you
 
00:57:26.150 --> 00:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
get your information that's in mass and
 
00:57:28.630 --> 00:57:28.640 align:start position:0%
or vaccinations uh increase suicide
 
00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:29.670 align:start position:0%
or vaccinations uh increase suicide
rates

00:57:29.670 --> 00:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
rates
 
00:57:30.950 --> 00:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative for the
 
00:57:33.109 --> 00:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
question and what i was referring to is
 
00:57:35.190 --> 00:57:35.200 align:start position:0%
it was a general statement that through
 
00:57:38.230 --> 00:57:38.240 align:start position:0%
the pandemic um this has been an issue
 
00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:39.349 align:start position:0%
the pandemic um this has been an issue
and

00:57:39.349 --> 00:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:57:40.549 --> 00:57:40.559 align:start position:0%
it it
 
00:57:42.069 --> 00:57:42.079 align:start position:0%
there's a number of triggers i mean
 
00:57:43.349 --> 00:57:43.359 align:start position:0%
everything from people losing their
 
00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
businesses to people that you know
 
00:57:47.829 --> 00:57:47.839 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:50.240 align:start position:0%
have their choices denied somebody that
 
00:57:51.829 --> 00:57:51.839 align:start position:0%
wants to go to a new hampshire
 
00:57:54.069 --> 00:57:54.079 align:start position:0%
university that can't now because they
 
00:57:55.670 --> 00:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
feel very strongly
 
00:57:57.430 --> 00:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
that they
 
00:57:58.630 --> 00:57:58.640 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:58:00.789 --> 00:58:00.799 align:start position:0%
they don't want to take what they feel
 
00:58:02.309 --> 00:58:02.319 align:start position:0%
is the risk
 
00:58:04.069 --> 00:58:04.079 align:start position:0%
to what long-term effects may be out
 
00:58:06.470 --> 00:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
there you know we we take a look i'm i'm
 
00:58:08.470 --> 00:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
not one who watches tv but
 
00:58:10.150 --> 00:58:10.160 align:start position:0%
anytime you see a
 
00:58:13.589 --> 00:58:13.599 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical company advertising
 
00:58:15.510 --> 00:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
various um
 
00:58:17.750 --> 00:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
cures that they have
 
00:58:19.510 --> 00:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
they go on and on about all the side
 
00:58:21.430 --> 00:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
effects that they have that's that's
 
00:58:23.190 --> 00:58:23.200 align:start position:0%
without exception but you don't hear
 
00:58:25.589 --> 00:58:25.599 align:start position:0%
about any side effects with this and
 
00:58:27.510 --> 00:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
and i hope and pray that there won't be
 
00:58:30.230 --> 00:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
any significant ones but
 
00:58:31.670 --> 00:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
where it's such a new
 
00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:32.870 align:start position:0%
where it's such a new
uh

00:58:32.870 --> 00:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:35.109 align:start position:0%
uh
vaccine

00:58:35.109 --> 00:58:35.119 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
00:58:36.950 --> 00:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
i respect and understand why some people
 
00:58:38.950 --> 00:58:38.960 align:start position:0%
might not want to partake
 
00:58:40.470 --> 00:58:40.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:58:41.349 --> 00:58:41.359 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:58:44.069 --> 00:58:44.079 align:start position:0%
thank you so a follow-up then it's it's
 
00:58:45.910 --> 00:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
your general statement
 
00:58:48.549 --> 00:58:48.559 align:start position:0%
of of the suicide rate based on max or
 
00:58:50.230 --> 00:58:50.240 align:start position:0%
that had nothing to do with statistical
 
00:58:52.069 --> 00:58:52.079 align:start position:0%
facts or metrics
 
00:58:53.510 --> 00:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
as he said
 
00:58:55.109 --> 00:58:55.119 align:start position:0%
thanks for the follow-up again i'm not
 
00:58:57.109 --> 00:58:57.119 align:start position:0%
suggesting that it's necessarily because
 
00:58:57.119 --> 00:58:57.910 align:start position:0%
suggesting that it's necessarily because
of

00:58:57.910 --> 00:58:57.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:58:59.670 --> 00:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
wearing a vaccine
 
00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
wearing a mask or not or whether they've

00:59:07.910 --> 00:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
with what we've done and this is part of
 
00:59:10.549 --> 00:59:10.559 align:start position:0%
what we've done adds to that
 
00:59:12.789 --> 00:59:12.799 align:start position:0%
depression thank you thank you
 
00:59:14.950 --> 00:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much further questions
 
00:59:17.190 --> 00:59:17.200 align:start position:0%
not seeing any hands thank you very much
 
00:59:19.270 --> 00:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
thank you next person we like to call
 
00:59:20.789 --> 00:59:20.799 align:start position:0%
forward is

00:59:33.589 --> 00:59:33.599 align:start position:0%
uh good morning mr chairman members of
 
00:59:34.870 --> 00:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
the committee tom cronin director of
 
00:59:36.549 --> 00:59:36.559 align:start position:0%
government relations for the university
 
00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
system of new hampshire thank you for
 
00:59:40.630 --> 00:59:40.640 align:start position:0%
having us here this morning uh
 
00:59:44.069 --> 00:59:44.079 align:start position:0%
we are opposed to uh house bill 1233
 
00:59:46.309 --> 00:59:46.319 align:start position:0%
maybe i'll just start quickly with a
 
00:59:48.789 --> 00:59:48.799 align:start position:0%
clarification uh no institution at the
 
00:59:50.150 --> 00:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
university system of new hampshire
 
00:59:52.789 --> 00:59:52.799 align:start position:0%
requires the covet 19 vaccination for
 
00:59:55.270 --> 00:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
enrollment uh i think the community
 
00:59:56.470 --> 00:59:56.480 align:start position:0%
college system would say the same but
 
00:59:57.990 --> 00:59:58.000 align:start position:0%
i'll let ms reed speak to that in a
 
00:59:58.000 --> 00:59:58.870 align:start position:0%
i'll let ms reed speak to that in a
moment

00:59:58.870 --> 00:59:58.880 align:start position:0%
moment
 
01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
uh we focused our testimony on largely
 
01:00:04.950 --> 01:00:04.960 align:start position:0%
on the mask portion of the legislation
 
01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh as that is something that is
 
01:00:08.470 --> 01:00:08.480 align:start position:0%
currently in our toolbox to try and
 
01:00:09.990 --> 01:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
prevent the spread of coven 19 on our
 
01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.190 align:start position:0%
prevent the spread of coven 19 on our
campuses

01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:11.200 align:start position:0%
campuses
 
01:00:12.870 --> 01:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
throughout the pandemic we've adjusted
 
01:00:14.950 --> 01:00:14.960 align:start position:0%
our campus guidance around masking
 
01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
gathering distancing and other guidance
 
01:00:19.510 --> 01:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
really based on on three i think
 
01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
important pieces one public health
 
01:00:24.630 --> 01:00:24.640 align:start position:0%
guidance from the state and from the cdc
 
01:00:26.230 --> 01:00:26.240 align:start position:0%
community transmission rates that we
 
01:00:28.470 --> 01:00:28.480 align:start position:0%
track and report on regularly and then
 
01:00:30.549 --> 01:00:30.559 align:start position:0%
the unique characteristics of a busy
 
01:00:30.559 --> 01:00:32.150 align:start position:0%
the unique characteristics of a busy
residential

01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
residential
 
01:00:33.910 --> 01:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
group of college campuses
 
01:00:36.150 --> 01:00:36.160 align:start position:0%
the flexibility to adapt based on those
 
01:00:38.230 --> 01:00:38.240 align:start position:0%
conditions have largely helped us to
 
01:00:39.990 --> 01:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
keep our case counts on our campuses
 
01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
well below our regional averages and i
 
01:00:43.910 --> 01:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
think most importantly to us and really
 
01:00:45.270 --> 01:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
to our students and their families is
 
01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:46.720 align:start position:0%
they've helped us to keep our campuses
 
01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:48.630 align:start position:0%
they've helped us to keep our campuses
open

01:00:48.630 --> 01:00:48.640 align:start position:0%
open
 
01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
we think it's important that we retain
 
01:00:53.190 --> 01:00:53.200 align:start position:0%
our flexibility to continue to adjust
 
01:00:55.109 --> 01:00:55.119 align:start position:0%
these requirements based on local
 
01:00:57.589 --> 01:00:57.599 align:start position:0%
conditions and based on ever evolving
 
01:00:59.430 --> 01:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
guidance that is how we sort of make our
 
01:01:01.349 --> 01:01:01.359 align:start position:0%
decisions around what we ask our
 
01:01:03.270 --> 01:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
students our faculty and our staff to do
 
01:01:04.710 --> 01:01:04.720 align:start position:0%
to try and keep each other and our
 
01:01:06.150 --> 01:01:06.160 align:start position:0%
communities and our host communities for
 
01:01:08.069 --> 01:01:08.079 align:start position:0%
that matter safe as we're continuing to
 
01:01:09.750 --> 01:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
understand this virus and try and all
 
01:01:11.349 --> 01:01:11.359 align:start position:0%
get through it together
 
01:01:13.589 --> 01:01:13.599 align:start position:0%
um i think that more or less summarizes
 
01:01:14.870 --> 01:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
what i'd like to share but of course i'd
 
01:01:16.630 --> 01:01:16.640 align:start position:0%
be happy to take questions from all of
 
01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much questions
 
01:01:22.230 --> 01:01:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
i was just wondering if you were aware
 
01:01:26.470 --> 01:01:26.480 align:start position:0%
how some of your
 
01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
students felt i know a number of them
 
01:01:30.630 --> 01:01:30.640 align:start position:0%
came to me
 
01:01:34.470 --> 01:01:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
their admittance fees and had been told
 
01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:40.640 align:start position:0%
prior to that that no masks and then by
 
01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
the next day suddenly there were masks
 
01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:43.670 align:start position:0%
the next day suddenly there were masks
and

01:01:43.670 --> 01:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:01:46.630 --> 01:01:46.640 align:start position:0%
uh quite a few of your students came and
 
01:01:48.309 --> 01:01:48.319 align:start position:0%
said you've got to do something they
 
01:01:48.319 --> 01:01:49.670 align:start position:0%
said you've got to do something they
lied

01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
lied
 
01:01:52.309 --> 01:01:52.319 align:start position:0%
so i i think broadly and i did check
 
01:01:53.829 --> 01:01:53.839 align:start position:0%
this prior to this conversation today to
 
01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
make sure i was right broadly our
 
01:01:56.309 --> 01:01:56.319 align:start position:0%
students are supportive of the
 
01:01:58.710 --> 01:01:58.720 align:start position:0%
requirements they appreciate that it is
 
01:02:00.789 --> 01:02:00.799 align:start position:0%
a community requirement that folks are
 
01:02:02.069 --> 01:02:02.079 align:start position:0%
wearing mass and trying to slow the
 
01:02:04.950 --> 01:02:04.960 align:start position:0%
spread um i i appreciate those students
 
01:02:07.829 --> 01:02:07.839 align:start position:0%
who if you recall where we were in in
 
01:02:10.470 --> 01:02:10.480 align:start position:0%
terms of transmission and this virus
 
01:02:12.150 --> 01:02:12.160 align:start position:0%
back when students were paying initial
 
01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
deposits to start last fall right we
 
01:02:17.670 --> 01:02:17.680 align:start position:0%
were in the summer of 2021 when
 
01:02:19.430 --> 01:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
community spread was significantly lower
 
01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
i don't know if we had started even
 
01:02:22.230 --> 01:02:22.240 align:start position:0%
hearing of delta yet we certainly hadn't
 
01:02:24.470 --> 01:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
heard of omicron yet we were in a very
 
01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
different place and that i think is the
 
01:02:28.309 --> 01:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
the crux of our testimony is the ongoing
 
01:02:31.029 --> 01:02:31.039 align:start position:0%
flexibility to continue to evolve
 
01:02:32.390 --> 01:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
how we
 
01:02:34.630 --> 01:02:34.640 align:start position:0%
react in an attempt to
 
01:02:36.870 --> 01:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
to to slow this virus on our residential
 
01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:38.150 align:start position:0%
to to slow this virus on our residential
campuses

01:02:38.150 --> 01:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
campuses
 
01:02:40.390 --> 01:02:40.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative moffitt thank
 
01:02:42.390 --> 01:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
you mr thank you mr cronin for being
 
01:02:45.190 --> 01:02:45.200 align:start position:0%
here what are the potential consequences
 
01:02:47.349 --> 01:02:47.359 align:start position:0%
to a student who
 
01:02:49.910 --> 01:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
defies a mask requirement thanks
 
01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
representative um we
 
01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
for both students and employees have
 
01:02:56.230 --> 01:02:56.240 align:start position:0%
different disciplinary processes for any
 
01:02:59.029 --> 01:02:59.039 align:start position:0%
violations of agreed-upon rules and
 
01:03:01.109 --> 01:03:01.119 align:start position:0%
requirements right so students
 
01:03:03.190 --> 01:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
follow what is called the student rules
 
01:03:05.670 --> 01:03:05.680 align:start position:0%
rights and responsibilities
 
01:03:08.470 --> 01:03:08.480 align:start position:0%
if there are violations of that they
 
01:03:10.390 --> 01:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
can go through a conduct process that
 
01:03:11.589 --> 01:03:11.599 align:start position:0%
attempts to understand exactly what
 
01:03:14.950 --> 01:03:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:17.109 --> 01:03:17.119 align:start position:0%
again checked this before uh kind of
 
01:03:18.789 --> 01:03:18.799 align:start position:0%
anticipating that question we have had
 
01:03:20.390 --> 01:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
no students have any serious
 
01:03:24.309 --> 01:03:24.319 align:start position:0%
disciplinary issues related to masking
 
01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:03:27.349 --> 01:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
i have one question then represent
 
01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
cordell are there any exceptions to
 
01:03:30.549 --> 01:03:30.559 align:start position:0%
wearing masks like during athletic
 
01:03:32.789 --> 01:03:32.799 align:start position:0%
events etc
 
01:03:35.029 --> 01:03:35.039 align:start position:0%
yes is the short answer uh i would need
 
01:03:35.039 --> 01:03:35.910 align:start position:0%
yes is the short answer uh i would need
to

01:03:35.910 --> 01:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:03:37.829 --> 01:03:37.839 align:start position:0%
i'd want to drill down exactly on on
 
01:03:39.029 --> 01:03:39.039 align:start position:0%
where you were
 
01:03:41.029 --> 01:03:41.039 align:start position:0%
asking but right if you watch our
 
01:03:42.789 --> 01:03:42.799 align:start position:0%
athletic events you don't see students
 
01:03:45.670 --> 01:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
wearing masks while they're playing
 
01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:47.440 align:start position:0%
does that also apply to those who are
 
01:03:49.589 --> 01:03:49.599 align:start position:0%
observing no so in for example the
 
01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
whittemore center
 
01:03:53.349 --> 01:03:53.359 align:start position:0%
you are required to wear masks thank you
 
01:03:54.950 --> 01:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli
 
01:03:56.309 --> 01:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you mr
 
01:03:56.319 --> 01:03:58.150 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you mr
cronin

01:03:58.150 --> 01:03:58.160 align:start position:0%
cronin
 
01:04:01.029 --> 01:04:01.039 align:start position:0%
i've had several conversations with a
 
01:04:04.950 --> 01:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
lady i know whose daughter attends unh
 
01:04:06.309 --> 01:04:06.319 align:start position:0%
but has been
 
01:04:09.270 --> 01:04:09.280 align:start position:0%
forced out of the nursing program
 
01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
because of vaccination requirements
 
01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
in working
 
01:04:17.029 --> 01:04:17.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:17.039 --> 01:04:18.549 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:04:18.549 --> 01:04:18.559 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:04:22.789 --> 01:04:22.799 align:start position:0%
naturally is very upset about that
 
01:04:22.799 --> 01:04:24.950 align:start position:0%
naturally is very upset about that
what

01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:04:28.230 --> 01:04:28.240 align:start position:0%
maybe is the policy or um
 
01:04:31.029 --> 01:04:31.039 align:start position:0%
what happens with a nursing student
 
01:04:33.270 --> 01:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
who is unvaccinated
 
01:04:35.029 --> 01:04:35.039 align:start position:0%
thank you representative um so i'll say
 
01:04:36.710 --> 01:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
a couple things i do know there was at
 
01:04:38.150 --> 01:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
least another piece of legislation i
 
01:04:39.990 --> 01:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
forget if it was in hhs or labor that
 
01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
specifically tried to speak to that
 
01:04:43.109 --> 01:04:43.119 align:start position:0%
clinical piece
 
01:04:45.430 --> 01:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
broadly for us as universities we
 
01:04:47.670 --> 01:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
partner with clinical sites in an effort
 
01:04:50.069 --> 01:04:50.079 align:start position:0%
to ensure that our students in nursing
 
01:04:51.829 --> 01:04:51.839 align:start position:0%
and other health professions have the
 
01:04:54.309 --> 01:04:54.319 align:start position:0%
opportunity to gain the real world
 
01:04:56.390 --> 01:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
experience they need to pass their
 
01:04:58.230 --> 01:04:58.240 align:start position:0%
license exams and become employed in the
 
01:04:58.240 --> 01:04:59.109 align:start position:0%
license exams and become employed in the
state

01:04:59.109 --> 01:04:59.119 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
in so doing we follow the rules that
 
01:05:03.430 --> 01:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
those clinical sites set for their
 
01:05:05.910 --> 01:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
employees so in that case i am going to
 
01:05:08.230 --> 01:05:08.240 align:start position:0%
assume that
 
01:05:10.549 --> 01:05:10.559 align:start position:0%
the site that the student was placed at
 
01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
had a vaccination requirement for their
 
01:05:15.109 --> 01:05:15.119 align:start position:0%
employees as such our student in order
 
01:05:16.710 --> 01:05:16.720 align:start position:0%
to be placed there has to follow those
 
01:05:18.549 --> 01:05:18.559 align:start position:0%
same rules
 
01:05:18.559 --> 01:05:19.910 align:start position:0%
same rules
follow-up

01:05:19.910 --> 01:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:05:22.630 --> 01:05:22.640 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um
 
01:05:25.349 --> 01:05:25.359 align:start position:0%
do you have exemptions such as medical
 
01:05:28.870 --> 01:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
exemptions for that requirement or um if
 
01:05:31.109 --> 01:05:31.119 align:start position:0%
they have had covet and have natural
 
01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
antibodies um
 
01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
which i think is part of the
 
01:05:41.349 --> 01:05:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:43.270 --> 01:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
so again that is not a policy that we
 
01:05:44.870 --> 01:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
have it is a policy that the clinical
 
01:05:46.470 --> 01:05:46.480 align:start position:0%
site has so i would ask the clinical
 
01:05:49.190 --> 01:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
site do you have an exemption uh for
 
01:05:50.710 --> 01:05:50.720 align:start position:0%
medical for
 
01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:51.589 align:start position:0%
medical for
uh

01:05:51.589 --> 01:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:05:51.599 --> 01:05:52.789 align:start position:0%
uh
pre-existing

01:05:52.789 --> 01:05:52.799 align:start position:0%
pre-existing
 
01:05:52.799 --> 01:05:53.990 align:start position:0%
pre-existing
exposure

01:05:53.990 --> 01:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
exposure
 
01:05:56.870 --> 01:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
one last one last
 
01:05:58.309 --> 01:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
do you have
 
01:06:03.109 --> 01:06:03.119 align:start position:0%
clinical facilities that do not have
 
01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
vaccination requirements or
 
01:06:07.829 --> 01:06:07.839 align:start position:0%
allow for medical exemptions
 
01:06:10.309 --> 01:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
i would need to double check um again i
 
01:06:11.670 --> 01:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
think that's a little bit of a better
 
01:06:13.750 --> 01:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
question for uh
 
01:06:17.670 --> 01:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:21.029 --> 01:06:21.039 align:start position:0%
but what i will say is we are challenged
 
01:06:23.670 --> 01:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
with the number of clinical sites that
 
01:06:25.510 --> 01:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
are available to our students this is
 
01:06:27.029 --> 01:06:27.039 align:start position:0%
this is a long-running challenge in
 
01:06:29.109 --> 01:06:29.119 align:start position:0%
terms of our ability to put more health
 
01:06:32.710 --> 01:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
care professionals into
 
01:06:34.870 --> 01:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
a bottleneck in terms of where they can
 
01:06:36.870 --> 01:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
uh go and get this this required
 
01:06:38.950 --> 01:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
clinical experience um so the number of
 
01:06:39.990 --> 01:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
sites are limited the number of
 
01:06:42.549 --> 01:06:42.559 align:start position:0%
placements are limited so i can't speak
 
01:06:44.870 --> 01:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
to exactly uh what the various
 
01:06:45.910 --> 01:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
requirements for all of them you
 
01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned nursing but there are similar
 
01:06:50.309 --> 01:06:50.319 align:start position:0%
rules in other allied health professions
 
01:06:52.069 --> 01:06:52.079 align:start position:0%
uh where the rules may be different so i
 
01:06:54.150 --> 01:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
can't speak exactly i'm happy to do a
 
01:06:55.270 --> 01:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up and see what i can get
 
01:06:57.430 --> 01:06:57.440 align:start position:0%
back to you on that but obviously
 
01:06:59.190 --> 01:06:59.200 align:start position:0%
as i think you know those requirements
 
01:07:01.510 --> 01:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
are are becoming more and more uh
 
01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:02.630 align:start position:0%
are are becoming more and more uh
broad-based

01:07:02.630 --> 01:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
broad-based
 
01:07:04.710 --> 01:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
in healthcare
 
01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh i have one question representative
 
01:07:08.549 --> 01:07:08.559 align:start position:0%
go ahead first
 
01:07:10.470 --> 01:07:10.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair and thank
 
01:07:13.510 --> 01:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
you mr cronin for taking my question
 
01:07:15.349 --> 01:07:15.359 align:start position:0%
representative trojan
 
01:07:17.750 --> 01:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
made reference to college students
 
01:07:21.109 --> 01:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
leaving new hampshire as a result of
 
01:07:23.670 --> 01:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
vaccine or mask requirements
 
01:07:26.309 --> 01:07:26.319 align:start position:0%
do you at the university have any sense
 
01:07:30.150 --> 01:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
of admission numbers or transfer numbers
 
01:07:31.349 --> 01:07:31.359 align:start position:0%
and how
 
01:07:33.430 --> 01:07:33.440 align:start position:0%
they would relate to the vaccine or the
 
01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:34.470 align:start position:0%
they would relate to the vaccine or the
masks

01:07:34.470 --> 01:07:34.480 align:start position:0%
masks
 
01:07:37.190 --> 01:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
we don't um so
 
01:07:38.789 --> 01:07:38.799 align:start position:0%
two pieces of that question again we do
 
01:07:40.470 --> 01:07:40.480 align:start position:0%
not have a vaccination requirement so
 
01:07:43.029 --> 01:07:43.039 align:start position:0%
there can be no to my knowledge a reason
 
01:07:44.150 --> 01:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
why somebody would leave because of
 
01:07:46.470 --> 01:07:46.480 align:start position:0%
vaccine requirement we can say however
 
01:07:48.789 --> 01:07:48.799 align:start position:0%
that if you look at our peers around the
 
01:07:50.470 --> 01:07:50.480 align:start position:0%
country and in new england there are a
 
01:07:51.430 --> 01:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
number of schools that do have
 
01:07:53.029 --> 01:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
vaccination requirements and we did hear
 
01:07:55.910 --> 01:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
early on from parents that they are
 
01:07:57.510 --> 01:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
concerned about sending their children
 
01:08:00.390 --> 01:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
to a school that doesn't have a
 
01:08:03.190 --> 01:08:03.200 align:start position:0%
stronger push towards a vaccine um so
 
01:08:05.029 --> 01:08:05.039 align:start position:0%
it's unclear if we didn't enroll
 
01:08:06.309 --> 01:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
students who chose instead to go
 
01:08:07.910 --> 01:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
somewhere else but again we do not have
 
01:08:09.670 --> 01:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
a vaccine requirement so i can't see why
 
01:08:11.109 --> 01:08:11.119 align:start position:0%
students would leave because of a
 
01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
vaccine requirement uh and then again
 
01:08:16.149 --> 01:08:16.159 align:start position:0%
broadly uh understanding there are cases
 
01:08:18.070 --> 01:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
of individuals who
 
01:08:19.669 --> 01:08:19.679 align:start position:0%
would rather not be wearing a mask i
 
01:08:20.789 --> 01:08:20.799 align:start position:0%
think we'd all rather not be wearing a
 
01:08:22.390 --> 01:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
mask we'd all rather not have a
 
01:08:23.829 --> 01:08:23.839 align:start position:0%
contagious airborne virus that we're
 
01:08:25.510 --> 01:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
dealing with also
 
01:08:27.829 --> 01:08:27.839 align:start position:0%
broadly i think uh
 
01:08:30.070 --> 01:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
we have very good compliance amongst our
 
01:08:33.030 --> 01:08:33.040 align:start position:0%
students on on masking requirements
 
01:08:34.789 --> 01:08:34.799 align:start position:0%
and i'll just ask mine very quickly and
 
01:08:36.070 --> 01:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
i think you can give me a quick answer
 
01:08:37.189 --> 01:08:37.199 align:start position:0%
in that
 
01:08:40.309 --> 01:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
the vaccines that students have we i've
 
01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
heard the percentages for keen psu unh
 
01:08:46.789 --> 01:08:46.799 align:start position:0%
they're quite high
 
01:08:49.189 --> 01:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
at least you know as in percentage-wise
 
01:08:50.950 --> 01:08:50.960 align:start position:0%
several months ago do you have any of
 
01:08:52.470 --> 01:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
that information available now of what
 
01:08:54.550 --> 01:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
you have as students that have been
 
01:08:56.870 --> 01:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
vaccinated yeah we are in the high 80
 
01:08:58.470 --> 01:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
percent among students it's actually
 
01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
probably higher if you take everybody
 
01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:01.990 align:start position:0%
probably higher if you take everybody
together

01:09:01.990 --> 01:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:09:04.229 --> 01:09:04.239 align:start position:0%
yes so we have a very highly vaccinated
 
01:09:05.990 --> 01:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
population of students employees and
 
01:09:08.550 --> 01:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
faculty voluntarily does that include
 
01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:10.239 align:start position:0%
the those campuses which were in the
 
01:09:12.550 --> 01:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
lower percentage like like keen at that
 
01:09:14.309 --> 01:09:14.319 align:start position:0%
time yes everybody has continued to
 
01:09:16.149 --> 01:09:16.159 align:start position:0%
trend upwards and i'm happy to get exact
 
01:09:17.590 --> 01:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
numbers for each of the campuses and get
 
01:09:20.229 --> 01:09:20.239 align:start position:0%
those over to you thank you
 
01:09:21.669 --> 01:09:21.679 align:start position:0%
not seeing any other questions thank you
 
01:09:23.749 --> 01:09:23.759 align:start position:0%
very much thank you all
 
01:09:24.870 --> 01:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
the next
 
01:09:27.030 --> 01:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
person on
 
01:09:41.269 --> 01:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:43.749 --> 01:09:43.759 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is sally stoddy i
 
01:09:46.950 --> 01:09:46.960 align:start position:0%
live in dover new hampshire
 
01:09:49.269 --> 01:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
i'm commenting as a
 
01:09:52.229 --> 01:09:52.239 align:start position:0%
self-interested citizen on this
 
01:09:54.310 --> 01:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
because i think
 
01:09:57.189 --> 01:09:57.199 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing are more and more
 
01:09:57.199 --> 01:09:58.390 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing are more and more
government

01:09:58.390 --> 01:09:58.400 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:10:00.229 --> 01:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
type regulations
 
01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
on everything in life related to
 
01:10:04.950 --> 01:10:04.960 align:start position:0%
anything they can
 
01:10:08.229 --> 01:10:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:12.790 --> 01:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
uh so i am in support of this bill
 
01:10:15.590 --> 01:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
and i'm very interested
 
01:10:18.149 --> 01:10:18.159 align:start position:0%
to see the science and i worked in
 
01:10:20.709 --> 01:10:20.719 align:start position:0%
medical research for 40 years
 
01:10:23.110 --> 01:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
in infectious disease transplant other
 
01:10:25.350 --> 01:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
disease areas i'm interested to see the
 
01:10:27.030 --> 01:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
data that show
 
01:10:31.910 --> 01:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:34.390 --> 01:10:34.400 align:start position:0%
an example used by one infectious
 
01:10:37.189 --> 01:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
disease person who i'm familiar with
 
01:10:39.189 --> 01:10:39.199 align:start position:0%
said using a mask
 
01:10:42.149 --> 01:10:42.159 align:start position:0%
to eliminate passage of a virus is like
 
01:10:44.790 --> 01:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
using a chain-link fence to keep the
 
01:10:46.950 --> 01:10:46.960 align:start position:0%
mosquitoes out
 
01:10:49.030 --> 01:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
the poor size
 
01:10:52.229 --> 01:10:52.239 align:start position:0%
in a mask even the n95s which are coming
 
01:10:54.950 --> 01:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
from china by the way most of them
 
01:10:58.470 --> 01:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
they're not stopping passage of a virus
 
01:11:00.310 --> 01:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
and certainly not
 
01:11:02.390 --> 01:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
all the rest of the masks that everyone
 
01:11:05.350 --> 01:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
is wearing even if you're double masked
 
01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:07.030 align:start position:0%
is wearing even if you're double masked
so

01:11:07.030 --> 01:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:11:09.430 --> 01:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
slowing the spread is
 
01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
an issue that people keep using the
 
01:11:12.550 --> 01:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
words of
 
01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:15.280 align:start position:0%
but yet they're not showing the science
 
01:11:17.030 --> 01:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
that would that would
 
01:11:20.070 --> 01:11:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:22.229 --> 01:11:22.239 align:start position:0%
if we have 80 or more of
 
01:11:23.750 --> 01:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
college kids
 
01:11:27.590 --> 01:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
vaccinated now uh
 
01:11:29.910 --> 01:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
you know we were told initially that
 
01:11:33.030 --> 01:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
vaccination stops the spread
 
01:11:35.830 --> 01:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
and the infection i mean the the true
 
01:11:38.790 --> 01:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
definition of vaccination is preventing
 
01:11:41.590 --> 01:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
infection and preventing transmission
 
01:11:44.390 --> 01:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
and interestingly now the cdc has tried
 
01:11:47.830 --> 01:11:47.840 align:start position:0%
to change the definition of vaccination
 
01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:49.030 align:start position:0%
to change the definition of vaccination
to

01:11:49.030 --> 01:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:50.070 align:start position:0%
to
prevent

01:11:50.070 --> 01:11:50.080 align:start position:0%
prevent
 
01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:51.110 align:start position:0%
prevent
um

01:11:51.110 --> 01:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:52.950 --> 01:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
serious infection something to that
 
01:11:55.270 --> 01:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
effect they're changing the definition
 
01:11:57.830 --> 01:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
of what vaccine actually means so
 
01:11:59.350 --> 01:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
there's a clear
 
01:12:01.590 --> 01:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
there's a clear government
 
01:12:03.990 --> 01:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
desire to
 
01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:04.870 align:start position:0%
desire to
change

01:12:04.870 --> 01:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:12:07.110 --> 01:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
how we think about things like this
 
01:12:11.910 --> 01:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
and for us to adopt whatever they say
 
01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:13.030 align:start position:0%
and for us to adopt whatever they say
um

01:12:13.030 --> 01:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:16.229 --> 01:12:16.239 align:start position:0%
if we're look we're talking about safety
 
01:12:18.550 --> 01:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
the adverse event reporting with these
 
01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:19.990 align:start position:0%
the adverse event reporting with these
vaccines

01:12:19.990 --> 01:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
vaccines
 
01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:20.830 align:start position:0%
vaccines
and

01:12:20.830 --> 01:12:20.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:12:24.709 --> 01:12:24.719 align:start position:0%
um the whole process is so under
 
01:12:24.719 --> 01:12:25.990 align:start position:0%
um the whole process is so under
reported

01:12:25.990 --> 01:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
reported
 
01:12:28.390 --> 01:12:28.400 align:start position:0%
it's it's seriously dangerous and for
 
01:12:30.229 --> 01:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
these young people
 
01:12:31.830 --> 01:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
these young adults they are in the
 
01:12:34.470 --> 01:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
highest bracket of to see the adverse
 
01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:36.630 align:start position:0%
highest bracket of to see the adverse
events

01:12:36.630 --> 01:12:36.640 align:start position:0%
events
 
01:12:38.870 --> 01:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
so to see that we're in the high 80
 
01:12:41.270 --> 01:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
percent in the vaccinations of all the
 
01:12:43.430 --> 01:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
unh type campuses
 
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
is quite concerning and i wonder who is
 
01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:47.750 align:start position:0%
is quite concerning and i wonder who is
pursuing

01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
pursuing
 
01:12:50.390 --> 01:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
reporting of adverse events with those
 
01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:52.229 align:start position:0%
reporting of adverse events with those
students

01:12:52.229 --> 01:12:52.239 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:12:55.110 --> 01:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
but back to the masks
 
01:12:57.590 --> 01:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
they really don't do anything that has
 
01:13:00.550 --> 01:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
been clearly documented
 
01:13:02.149 --> 01:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
relative to viral
 
01:13:02.159 --> 01:13:06.630 align:start position:0%
relative to viral
transmission

01:13:06.630 --> 01:13:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:08.149 --> 01:13:08.159 align:start position:0%
that's the point i think is most
 
01:13:08.159 --> 01:13:09.189 align:start position:0%
that's the point i think is most
important

01:13:09.189 --> 01:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:13:10.149 --> 01:13:10.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:13:11.669 --> 01:13:11.679 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there questions
 
01:13:13.510 --> 01:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
from the committee yes representative
 
01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:15.750 align:start position:0%
from the committee yes representative
waltz

01:13:15.750 --> 01:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
waltz
 
01:13:17.430 --> 01:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um
 
01:13:19.830 --> 01:13:19.840 align:start position:0%
so you have made a lot of assertions
 
01:13:21.910 --> 01:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
here and you have not given us any of
 
01:13:23.990 --> 01:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
the scientific information based on this
 
01:13:25.110 --> 01:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering if you have any
 
01:13:27.910 --> 01:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
studies to support your assertions that
 
01:13:30.310 --> 01:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
masks are not helpful that adverse
 
01:13:32.149 --> 01:13:32.159 align:start position:0%
events are high particularly among young
 
01:13:32.159 --> 01:13:33.430 align:start position:0%
events are high particularly among young
people

01:13:33.430 --> 01:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:13:35.910 --> 01:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
and i just you know it's you can say
 
01:13:37.510 --> 01:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
anything you want
 
01:13:40.310 --> 01:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
we get an enormous amount of email and
 
01:13:41.990 --> 01:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
information every day that includes a
 
01:13:45.189 --> 01:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
lot of scientific studies that actually
 
01:13:47.030 --> 01:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
contradict what you're saying and i'm
 
01:13:48.630 --> 01:13:48.640 align:start position:0%
wondering if you have the scientific
 
01:13:50.790 --> 01:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
studies on the other side to prove what
 
01:13:53.830 --> 01:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
you're saying i can certainly uh forward
 
01:13:56.709 --> 01:13:56.719 align:start position:0%
them to people um i certainly didn't
 
01:13:56.719 --> 01:13:57.990 align:start position:0%
them to people um i certainly didn't
come

01:13:57.990 --> 01:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
come
 
01:14:00.550 --> 01:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
you know ready to
 
01:14:02.630 --> 01:14:02.640 align:start position:0%
share them with anybody here today but i
 
01:14:04.709 --> 01:14:04.719 align:start position:0%
can certainly send them to whomever
 
01:14:06.630 --> 01:14:06.640 align:start position:0%
would be the point person
 
01:14:08.390 --> 01:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
follow-up go ahead
 
01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:09.430 align:start position:0%
follow-up go ahead
um

01:14:09.430 --> 01:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:11.189 --> 01:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
you also
 
01:14:13.990 --> 01:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
reference that the cdc is changing some
 
01:14:15.750 --> 01:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
of its recommendations and observations
 
01:14:17.270 --> 01:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
along the way
 
01:14:19.990 --> 01:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
would you agree that as more scientific
 
01:14:21.990 --> 01:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
information becomes available it's
 
01:14:23.350 --> 01:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
appropriate to update your
 
01:14:25.350 --> 01:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
recommendations and information based on
 
01:14:27.110 --> 01:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
the additional information that's coming
 
01:14:29.669 --> 01:14:29.679 align:start position:0%
out as this pandemic progresses
 
01:14:32.229 --> 01:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
well i'm not saying that recommendations
 
01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
cannot be fluid based on how
 
01:14:36.390 --> 01:14:36.400 align:start position:0%
how the
 
01:14:38.950 --> 01:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
pandemic has gone but when you redefine
 
01:14:41.110 --> 01:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
the word vaccine and vaccination that
 
01:14:44.550 --> 01:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
has been in place for 75 years just to
 
01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:45.830 align:start position:0%
has been in place for 75 years just to
fit

01:14:45.830 --> 01:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
fit
 
01:14:47.990 --> 01:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
a current situation
 
01:14:50.870 --> 01:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
that's not scientific
 
01:14:52.709 --> 01:14:52.719 align:start position:0%
so if there's a point person that i can
 
01:14:54.550 --> 01:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
forward the links to i will be most
 
01:14:57.990 --> 01:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
happy to do so yes you can uh on the web
 
01:14:59.990 --> 01:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
you you we have a site where you can
 
01:15:02.709 --> 01:15:02.719 align:start position:0%
email directly to all committee members
 
01:15:06.390 --> 01:15:06.400 align:start position:0%
or to any individual on the committee
 
01:15:08.870 --> 01:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
and we also have a committee researcher
 
01:15:10.790 --> 01:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
that we can get after this hearing we
 
01:15:13.510 --> 01:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
can give you the data email address as
 
01:15:15.189 --> 01:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
well i would i would appreciate that
 
01:15:17.510 --> 01:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
because i can supply those thank you so
 
01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:19.830 align:start position:0%
because i can supply those thank you so
much

01:15:19.830 --> 01:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
okay the next individual is shannon reed
 
01:15:34.229 --> 01:15:34.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:35.830 --> 01:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman and members of
 
01:15:37.990 --> 01:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is shannon reed i
 
01:15:39.830 --> 01:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
am director of government affairs for
 
01:15:41.110 --> 01:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
the community college system of new
 
01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:42.070 align:start position:0%
the community college system of new
hampshire

01:15:42.070 --> 01:15:42.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:15:43.750 --> 01:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
i'm here this morning to speak in
 
01:15:47.030 --> 01:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
opposition to house bill 1233.
 
01:15:48.630 --> 01:15:48.640 align:start position:0%
this bill would remove the ability of
 
01:15:50.630 --> 01:15:50.640 align:start position:0%
our institutions to manage campus
 
01:15:52.790 --> 01:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
environments in ways that support
 
01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
on-site learning
 
01:15:55.990 --> 01:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
while the community college system does
 
01:15:58.149 --> 01:15:58.159 align:start position:0%
not have a covid 19 vaccination
 
01:16:00.390 --> 01:16:00.400 align:start position:0%
requirement we do consider the ability
 
01:16:02.310 --> 01:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
to require masks in certain
 
01:16:04.790 --> 01:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
circumstances to be an important tool to
 
01:16:06.870 --> 01:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
keep our campuses open for in-person
 
01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:07.910 align:start position:0%
keep our campuses open for in-person
learning

01:16:07.910 --> 01:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
learning
 
01:16:10.229 --> 01:16:10.239 align:start position:0%
we are therefore opposed to a statutory
 
01:16:11.990 --> 01:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
prohibition on our college's ability to
 
01:16:14.390 --> 01:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
require masks or facial coverings
 
01:16:16.470 --> 01:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
community colleges are known for
 
01:16:17.910 --> 01:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
hands-on learning
 
01:16:19.830 --> 01:16:19.840 align:start position:0%
ranging from programs like nursing
 
01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
respiratory therapy
 
01:16:24.390 --> 01:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
radiation therapy dental assisting
 
01:16:26.630 --> 01:16:26.640 align:start position:0%
to firefighting welding
 
01:16:29.590 --> 01:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
diesel technology hvac and many more
 
01:16:32.070 --> 01:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
focused on-site in-person classroom and
 
01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
lab work is critical and indispensable
 
01:16:36.550 --> 01:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
to these and many other programs that we
 
01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:38.550 align:start position:0%
to these and many other programs that we
offer

01:16:38.550 --> 01:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
offer
 
01:16:41.510 --> 01:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
in march of 2020 our colleges shifted
 
01:16:43.430 --> 01:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
almost entirely to remote learning as
 
01:16:44.709 --> 01:16:44.719 align:start position:0%
did most of the colleges and
 
01:16:46.390 --> 01:16:46.400 align:start position:0%
universities in the country
 
01:16:48.709 --> 01:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
in the summer of 2020 we began bringing
 
01:16:51.030 --> 01:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
students back to on-site instruction
 
01:16:53.110 --> 01:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
beginning with our lab courses
 
01:16:55.189 --> 01:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
in bringing students back we implemented
 
01:16:56.870 --> 01:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
several strategies to mitigate the
 
01:16:59.350 --> 01:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
potential spread of covid these included
 
01:17:01.590 --> 01:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
reconfiguring classrooms and lab spaces
 
01:17:03.830 --> 01:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
installing plexiglass dividers adjusting
 
01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
scheduling improving ventilation
 
01:17:08.070 --> 01:17:08.080 align:start position:0%
reducing class sizes and in certain
 
01:17:10.470 --> 01:17:10.480 align:start position:0%
circumstances requiring masks
 
01:17:12.470 --> 01:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
we have adjusted our approach as local
 
01:17:14.390 --> 01:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
circumstances have evolved
 
01:17:16.070 --> 01:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
following community transmission rates
 
01:17:17.750 --> 01:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
and being responsive to other specific
 
01:17:20.070 --> 01:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
situations on our campuses i'd like you
 
01:17:22.390 --> 01:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
all to picture a nursing lab
 
01:17:23.669 --> 01:17:23.679 align:start position:0%
you have
 
01:17:26.310 --> 01:17:26.320 align:start position:0%
a room that's set up like a hospital
 
01:17:28.830 --> 01:17:28.840 align:start position:0%
wing might be with beds you have
 
01:17:31.189 --> 01:17:31.199 align:start position:0%
students working together with an
 
01:17:33.430 --> 01:17:33.440 align:start position:0%
instructor clustered around a mannequin
 
01:17:35.669 --> 01:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
which is a technologically enabled kind
 
01:17:39.110 --> 01:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
of model of a human body that can be
 
01:17:40.550 --> 01:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
you can implement simulations for
 
01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
certain conditions that the students are
 
01:17:43.990 --> 01:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
then are then obligated to kind of
 
01:17:45.830 --> 01:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
figure out and solve together
 
01:17:47.510 --> 01:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
this is not a situation where you can
 
01:17:49.030 --> 01:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
really socially distance from one
 
01:17:51.110 --> 01:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
another or from your instructor
 
01:17:52.470 --> 01:17:52.480 align:start position:0%
sure there are there are classrooms
 
01:17:54.390 --> 01:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
where we might be able to
 
01:17:56.070 --> 01:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
like a room like this it's a very large
 
01:17:59.030 --> 01:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
room we are all spaced out
 
01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
so to speak um
 
01:18:02.950 --> 01:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
that's it's possible in a room like this
 
01:18:05.110 --> 01:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
in some circumstances but in a lot of
 
01:18:06.550 --> 01:18:06.560 align:start position:0%
our hands-on learning environments
 
01:18:09.110 --> 01:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
that's simply not possible or or
 
01:18:11.510 --> 01:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
feasible or realistic or effective from
 
01:18:13.830 --> 01:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
a learning perspective
 
01:18:15.590 --> 01:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
the use of masks in certain conditions
 
01:18:17.510 --> 01:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
such as i just described
 
01:18:19.030 --> 01:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
when people are likely to be in close
 
01:18:21.270 --> 01:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
proximity for sustained periods of time
 
01:18:22.950 --> 01:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
continues to be the recommendation of
 
01:18:24.709 --> 01:18:24.719 align:start position:0%
public health authorities
 
01:18:26.310 --> 01:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
and it's a tool that we can employ to
 
01:18:28.709 --> 01:18:28.719 align:start position:0%
keep our colleges open to keep educating
 
01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
new hampshire students and keep
 
01:18:31.110 --> 01:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
graduating granite staters who will
 
01:18:33.110 --> 01:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
become part of our workforce
 
01:18:35.030 --> 01:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
i'd like to mention that we train
 
01:18:36.709 --> 01:18:36.719 align:start position:0%
students for the professions that are in
 
01:18:38.630 --> 01:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
high demand and this is even more
 
01:18:40.390 --> 01:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
important now given the present labor
 
01:18:42.229 --> 01:18:42.239 align:start position:0%
market dynamics
 
01:18:43.830 --> 01:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
unprecedented numbers of people are
 
01:18:45.669 --> 01:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
opting out of the workforce whether
 
01:18:47.910 --> 01:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
they're displaced stopping out while
 
01:18:49.590 --> 01:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
home lives and domestic economies are
 
01:18:51.669 --> 01:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
disrupted or choosing to be part of the
 
01:18:53.110 --> 01:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
great resignation
 
01:18:54.550 --> 01:18:54.560 align:start position:0%
our students are enrolled in community
 
01:18:56.310 --> 01:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
college programs because they want to
 
01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:57.110 align:start position:0%
college programs because they want to
work

01:18:57.110 --> 01:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:18:58.470 --> 01:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
they want to complete their their
 
01:19:00.709 --> 01:19:00.719 align:start position:0%
training and take their place as nurses
 
01:19:02.790 --> 01:19:02.800 align:start position:0%
medical assistants electrical line
 
01:19:05.270 --> 01:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
workers cdl drivers firefighters and
 
01:19:07.669 --> 01:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
paramedics chefs pipe welders child care
 
01:19:09.910 --> 01:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
teachers and more and more
 
01:19:11.750 --> 01:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
we can only help them do that if we have
 
01:19:13.270 --> 01:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
the tools to keep their learning
 
01:19:15.590 --> 01:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
environments open and accessible to them
 
01:19:16.950 --> 01:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
and to the faculty whose role is
 
01:19:18.550 --> 01:19:18.560 align:start position:0%
critical to preparing the next wave of
 
01:19:20.470 --> 01:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
our state's workforce
 
01:19:22.709 --> 01:19:22.719 align:start position:0%
we strongly believe that requiring masks
 
01:19:24.790 --> 01:19:24.800 align:start position:0%
in certain circumstances has been a key
 
01:19:27.669 --> 01:19:27.679 align:start position:0%
element in our ability to do that
 
01:19:29.910 --> 01:19:29.920 align:start position:0%
just last month we graduated a class of
 
01:19:32.550 --> 01:19:32.560 align:start position:0%
40 new lpns from river valley community
 
01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:33.510 align:start position:0%
40 new lpns from river valley community
college

01:19:33.510 --> 01:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
college
 
01:19:35.030 --> 01:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
these students were able to complete
 
01:19:36.550 --> 01:19:36.560 align:start position:0%
their program of study without
 
01:19:38.630 --> 01:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
significant disruption and we believe
 
01:19:39.990 --> 01:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
the fact that they were masked while
 
01:19:42.070 --> 01:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
working together in classrooms and labs
 
01:19:44.070 --> 01:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
as they will in the workplace was an
 
01:19:46.229 --> 01:19:46.239 align:start position:0%
important part of our ability to to help
 
01:19:47.910 --> 01:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
them complete the program
 
01:19:50.709 --> 01:19:50.719 align:start position:0%
these 40 lpns and all the newer cohorts
 
01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
of students who are going through the
 
01:19:53.990 --> 01:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
program now are desperately needed in
 
01:19:55.669 --> 01:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
today's assisted living facilities
 
01:19:57.910 --> 01:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
hospitals and other environments
 
01:19:59.189 --> 01:19:59.199 align:start position:0%
as you're no doubt hearing from your
 
01:20:00.630 --> 01:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
constituents in your districts across
 
01:20:01.669 --> 01:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:20:03.750 --> 01:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
we do not believe that masking is too
 
01:20:05.270 --> 01:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
high a burden to protect the education
 
01:20:08.149 --> 01:20:08.159 align:start position:0%
of students like these new nurses
 
01:20:10.070 --> 01:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
when i was preparing testimony i reached
 
01:20:11.590 --> 01:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
out to our college leadership to ask if
 
01:20:13.110 --> 01:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
they had heard a lot of complaints from
 
01:20:15.189 --> 01:20:15.199 align:start position:0%
students about the masking requirement
 
01:20:17.430 --> 01:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
and the answer was was
 
01:20:19.750 --> 01:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
very resoundingly no in fact they had
 
01:20:21.510 --> 01:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
more complaints before
 
01:20:23.510 --> 01:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
we were requiring masks in these indoor
 
01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:25.350 align:start position:0%
we were requiring masks in these indoor
circumstances

01:20:25.350 --> 01:20:25.360 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
01:20:26.390 --> 01:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
because people were concerned about
 
01:20:27.590 --> 01:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
their safety they were concerned about
 
01:20:29.350 --> 01:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
their ability to continue to come to
 
01:20:31.350 --> 01:20:31.360 align:start position:0%
campus for that on-site instruction i
 
01:20:33.510 --> 01:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
have a few letters that i'll submit from
 
01:20:35.350 --> 01:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
students at our colleges
 
01:20:36.950 --> 01:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
i'd like to just read a couple excerpts
 
01:20:37.910 --> 01:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
for you
 
01:20:40.070 --> 01:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
one is from a respiratory care student
 
01:20:42.149 --> 01:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
at river valley community college
 
01:20:44.070 --> 01:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
he says the high quality of the programs
 
01:20:45.510 --> 01:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire's community college
 
01:20:47.510 --> 01:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
network will not only equip me with the
 
01:20:49.270 --> 01:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
skill set needed to care for the state's
 
01:20:51.189 --> 01:20:51.199 align:start position:0%
sickest patients but afford me the
 
01:20:53.270 --> 01:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
financial stability to support my family
 
01:20:54.629 --> 01:20:54.639 align:start position:0%
it's of the highest importance to me
 
01:20:56.229 --> 01:20:56.239 align:start position:0%
that it's higher education system
 
01:20:58.390 --> 01:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
promotes a safe learning environment and
 
01:20:59.910 --> 01:20:59.920 align:start position:0%
keeps students attending in-person
 
01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:00.950 align:start position:0%
keeps students attending in-person
classes

01:21:00.950 --> 01:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
classes
 
01:21:02.470 --> 01:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
he also notes a high percentage of
 
01:21:04.229 --> 01:21:04.239 align:start position:0%
healthcare workers who have experienced
 
01:21:06.550 --> 01:21:06.560 align:start position:0%
burnout and he says if i am to
 
01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
successfully join the ranks to support
 
01:21:11.430 --> 01:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's healthcare workforce
 
01:21:13.270 --> 01:21:13.280 align:start position:0%
it's important that policies protect
 
01:21:14.950 --> 01:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
both the professional and the patient
 
01:21:17.430 --> 01:21:17.440 align:start position:0%
setting starting not in the icu but in
 
01:21:19.270 --> 01:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
the classroom
 
01:21:22.070 --> 01:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
a letter from a nursing student at nhgi
 
01:21:23.590 --> 01:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
she says she's lived in the lakes region
 
01:21:25.350 --> 01:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
her whole life and hopes to work locally
 
01:21:26.870 --> 01:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
once she graduates providing nursing
 
01:21:28.870 --> 01:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
care to fellow new hampshire residents
 
01:21:30.870 --> 01:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
and she says wearing masks is what makes
 
01:21:33.270 --> 01:21:33.280 align:start position:0%
me feel safe going to my classes labs
 
01:21:35.350 --> 01:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
and clinical assignments it is also a
 
01:21:36.950 --> 01:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
standard practice in healthcare and has
 
01:21:38.229 --> 01:21:38.239 align:start position:0%
helped to protect the patients i work
 
01:21:40.310 --> 01:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
with each week in clinical
 
01:21:41.830 --> 01:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
she said it's essential that we're able
 
01:21:43.910 --> 01:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
to participate in on-site hands-on
 
01:21:46.629 --> 01:21:46.639 align:start position:0%
learning and wearing masks is one way to
 
01:21:48.870 --> 01:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
keep students from becoming sick missing
 
01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:49.990 align:start position:0%
keep students from becoming sick missing
classes

01:21:49.990 --> 01:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
classes
 
01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
and missing those clinical experiences
 
01:21:55.189 --> 01:21:55.199 align:start position:0%
a final letter i have is from the
 
01:21:56.629 --> 01:21:56.639 align:start position:0%
student government association at great
 
01:21:58.629 --> 01:21:58.639 align:start position:0%
bay community college saying this bill
 
01:22:00.470 --> 01:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
would disrupt the precautionary systems
 
01:22:02.310 --> 01:22:02.320 align:start position:0%
we have in place to ensure the safety of
 
01:22:03.590 --> 01:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
our students from the exposure to the
 
01:22:05.590 --> 01:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
coveted illness we know that layered
 
01:22:07.910 --> 01:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
measures such as immunizations masks
 
01:22:09.430 --> 01:22:09.440 align:start position:0%
sufficient ventilation and other
 
01:22:11.910 --> 01:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
regulations may help save lives and
 
01:22:12.950 --> 01:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
guarantee that our students and
 
01:22:14.470 --> 01:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
instructors can remain in in-person
 
01:22:17.110 --> 01:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
educational environments

um over the course of the last four
 
01:23:14.719 --> 01:23:15.590 align:start position:0%
um over the course of the last four

weeks
 
01:23:17.270 --> 01:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
i haven't been before this committee
 
01:23:19.030 --> 01:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
i've been to a number of other house
 
01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:20.470 align:start position:0%
i've been to a number of other house
bills

01:23:20.470 --> 01:23:20.480 align:start position:0%
bills
 
01:23:22.550 --> 01:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
in regards to i like to call them
 
01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:23.910 align:start position:0%
in regards to i like to call them
freedom

01:23:23.910 --> 01:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
freedom
 
01:23:25.830 --> 01:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
mandates mass
 
01:23:27.910 --> 01:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
all of all of this it's been two years
 
01:23:29.910 --> 01:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
and it's time to end it all
 
01:23:32.390 --> 01:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
and there seems to be a common theme
 
01:23:34.870 --> 01:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
people on our side um
 
01:23:37.110 --> 01:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
we're just individuals again i'm just at
 
01:23:38.950 --> 01:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
groves from hooksett new hampshire i do
 
01:23:40.310 --> 01:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
have a daughter at keene state college
 
01:23:42.310 --> 01:23:42.320 align:start position:0%
which i'll get to that in a second
 
01:23:45.350 --> 01:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
um but at other hearings it's it's just
 
01:23:47.510 --> 01:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
individuals coming here to fight for our
 
01:23:49.830 --> 01:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
freedoms and the other side
 
01:23:52.629 --> 01:23:52.639 align:start position:0%
um seems to be you know paid lobbyists
 
01:23:55.830 --> 01:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
lawyers hospital administrators and it
 
01:23:57.669 --> 01:23:57.679 align:start position:0%
seems to be all about the money they're
 
01:23:59.270 --> 01:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
they're worried that you know all these
 
01:24:00.870 --> 01:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
bills if we pass them we're gonna lose
 
01:24:03.430 --> 01:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
all this federal funding and
 
01:24:05.750 --> 01:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
we we've got to get beyond that because
 
01:24:07.030 --> 01:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
it's not going to happen they're not
 
01:24:08.470 --> 01:24:08.480 align:start position:0%
going to stop our medicaid money if we
 
01:24:09.990 --> 01:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
if we pass these bills it's not going to
 
01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:11.430 align:start position:0%
if we pass these bills it's not going to
happen

01:24:11.430 --> 01:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
happen
 
01:24:13.270 --> 01:24:13.280 align:start position:0%
states break federal laws all the time
 
01:24:15.510 --> 01:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
and i'll just say sanctuary cities they
 
01:24:16.950 --> 01:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
still get their money
 
01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:18.550 align:start position:0%
still get their money
um

01:24:18.550 --> 01:24:18.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:19.830 --> 01:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
getting back to
 
01:24:21.910 --> 01:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
this bill and all of these bills i'm
 
01:24:23.669 --> 01:24:23.679 align:start position:0%

torture because i've seen it
 
01:24:29.350 --> 01:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
our kids for two years
 
01:24:31.270 --> 01:24:31.280 align:start position:0%
imagine a three-year-old who's now five
 
01:24:33.270 --> 01:24:33.280 align:start position:0%
who's been stuck in a mask
 
01:24:35.270 --> 01:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
what's going through that kid's head
 
01:24:37.270 --> 01:24:37.280 align:start position:0%
i've watched my daughter graduated
 
01:24:39.750 --> 01:24:39.760 align:start position:0%

she was taken for 10 days put in
 
01:25:14.870 --> 01:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
isolation with all the other coveted
 
01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:15.910 align:start position:0%

01:25:18.470 --> 01:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
meanwhile my daughter who's now living
 
01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:20.470 align:start position:0%
meanwhile my daughter who's now living
alone

01:25:20.470 --> 01:25:20.480 align:start position:0%
alone
 
01:25:22.790 --> 01:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
couldn't because she wasn't vaccinated
 
01:25:25.430 --> 01:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
she had to go to another dorm of
 
01:25:27.350 --> 01:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
isolation for 10 days or she had the
 
01:25:29.110 --> 01:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
option of going home
 
01:25:32.310 --> 01:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
so she called me crying all alone in a
 
01:25:35.590 --> 01:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
room with in a dorm with no other people
 
01:25:37.910 --> 01:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
i guess there was one ra there
 
01:25:41.430 --> 01:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
and she just felt again 18 years old
 
01:25:43.510 --> 01:25:43.520 align:start position:0%

01:25:46.149 --> 01:25:46.159 align:start position:0%
isolated alone and just trying to just
 
01:25:47.910 --> 01:25:47.920 align:start position:0%
trying to go to school
 
01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:49.030 align:start position:0%
trying to go to school
um

01:25:49.030 --> 01:25:49.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:50.550 --> 01:25:50.560 align:start position:0%
after three days she called me because i
 
01:25:51.910 --> 01:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
said why don't you just come home she
 
01:25:53.669 --> 01:25:53.679 align:start position:0%
chose not to
 
01:25:55.750 --> 01:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
acclimated to it said hey i got my own
 
01:25:58.229 --> 01:25:58.239 align:start position:0%
bathroom i get to eat alone i can study
 
01:26:00.310 --> 01:26:00.320 align:start position:0%
i got my own tv anyway the point of the
 
01:26:01.750 --> 01:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
story is
 
01:26:03.350 --> 01:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
that she went back to her second
 
01:26:05.590 --> 01:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
semester and about a week into her
 
01:26:07.910 --> 01:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
second semester she was visited by a
 
01:26:10.390 --> 01:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
girl named kathy who said she was an
 
01:26:12.790 --> 01:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
advocate for the for the school
 
01:26:15.350 --> 01:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
and she was a senior and she was asked
 
01:26:17.189 --> 01:26:17.199 align:start position:0%
well how'd your first semester go great
 
01:26:18.709 --> 01:26:18.719 align:start position:0%
blah blah blah blah blah and then
 
01:26:20.390 --> 01:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
towards the end i got into the you know
 
01:26:22.149 --> 01:26:22.159 align:start position:0%
the cover discussion and she asked my
 
01:26:23.750 --> 01:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
daughter why she wasn't vaccinated and
 
01:26:25.830 --> 01:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
she said well that's my choice my father
 
01:26:27.270 --> 01:26:27.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't want me to be vaccinated i don't
 
01:26:29.830 --> 01:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
want to be vaccinated and that's that
 
01:26:31.750 --> 01:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
and she said well you might as well
 
01:26:33.270 --> 01:26:33.280 align:start position:0%
and again correct me if
 
01:26:34.950 --> 01:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
this doesn't sound
 
01:26:37.189 --> 01:26:37.199 align:start position:0%
like something an advocate would do
 
01:26:38.550 --> 01:26:38.560 align:start position:0%
said why don't you just you might as
 
01:26:39.990 --> 01:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
well get vaccinated because by the time
 
01:26:41.110 --> 01:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
you graduate you're going to have to be
 
01:26:43.350 --> 01:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
vaccinated anyway so
 
01:26:44.870 --> 01:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure why that was said to her
 
01:26:47.110 --> 01:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure who this cathy girl was
 
01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:48.070 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure who this cathy girl was
but

01:26:48.070 --> 01:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:26:50.070 --> 01:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
these kids have enough to do just
 
01:26:51.990 --> 01:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
getting their studies done and not
 
01:26:53.910 --> 01:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
having to worry about being vaccinated
 
01:26:56.629 --> 01:26:56.639 align:start position:0%
or wearing a mask and
 
01:26:58.629 --> 01:26:58.639 align:start position:0%
you mentioned about the evidence of
 
01:27:00.709 --> 01:27:00.719 align:start position:0%
whether the masks work or not there's
 
01:27:02.229 --> 01:27:02.239 align:start position:0%
been doctors at all of these other
 
01:27:04.070 --> 01:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
hearings i i've got the notes and i can
 
01:27:06.229 --> 01:27:06.239 align:start position:0%
find these the doctor yesterday in one
 
01:27:08.950 --> 01:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
of the meetings he phenomenal i forget
 
01:27:11.910 --> 01:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
his name but he went through details
 
01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:12.950 align:start position:0%
his name but he went through details
about

01:27:12.950 --> 01:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:27:16.709 --> 01:27:16.719 align:start position:0%
the cloth masks the n95s and and micron
 
01:27:19.030 --> 01:27:19.040 align:start position:0%
sizes and everything and
 
01:27:21.510 --> 01:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
if you do the research the cloth masks
 
01:27:23.030 --> 01:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
really are
 
01:27:25.910 --> 01:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
fairly useless now so you know
 
01:27:28.070 --> 01:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
we got to move on i mean we're the
 
01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:29.760 align:start position:0%

starting new year's day
 
01:27:58.790 --> 01:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
it was with a number of other drugs with
 
01:28:01.189 --> 01:28:01.199 align:start position:0%
vitamins and zinc
 
01:28:03.910 --> 01:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
it's an amazing drug please do your
 
01:28:05.990 --> 01:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
research on that other countries are
 
01:28:08.790 --> 01:28:08.800 align:start position:0%
getting out of covet india
 
01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:10.390 align:start position:0%
getting out of covet india
japan

01:28:10.390 --> 01:28:10.400 align:start position:0%
japan
 
01:28:12.390 --> 01:28:12.400 align:start position:0%
it works it's been fda approved since
 
01:28:14.870 --> 01:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
1987 they just need to repurpose it
 
01:28:16.550 --> 01:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much are there
 
01:28:18.310 --> 01:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
any questions representative are you
 
01:28:19.590 --> 01:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
willing to take a question
 
01:28:21.270 --> 01:28:21.280 align:start position:0%
representative moffatt thank you mr and
 
01:28:23.830 --> 01:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming in and
 
01:28:25.110 --> 01:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
making the effort
 
01:28:27.750 --> 01:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh you mentioned that kathy the advocate
 
01:28:30.070 --> 01:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
at keene state uh
 
01:28:31.590 --> 01:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
asked your daughter about a vaccination
 
01:28:33.990 --> 01:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
status how did this
 
01:28:35.510 --> 01:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
advocate as you put it how did she know
 
01:28:37.270 --> 01:28:37.280 align:start position:0%
your daughter's vaccination status
 
01:28:38.790 --> 01:28:38.800 align:start position:0%
that's what i'd like to know but they
 
01:28:39.910 --> 01:28:39.920 align:start position:0%
all know it
 
01:28:41.590 --> 01:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
the kids all know it too as a matter of
 
01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:42.950 align:start position:0%
the kids all know it too as a matter of
fact

01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
fact
 
01:28:44.790 --> 01:28:44.800 align:start position:0%
the kids are making a mockery of this
 
01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:45.750 align:start position:0%
the kids are making a mockery of this
okay

01:28:45.750 --> 01:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:28:47.669 --> 01:28:47.679 align:start position:0%
they have five or more kids in their
 
01:28:49.510 --> 01:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
dorm it's a spreader party if they have
 
01:28:51.110 --> 01:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
ten or more it's a super spreader then
 
01:28:52.790 --> 01:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
they have the ultra super spreaders
 
01:28:55.350 --> 01:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
these guys are having fun with this at
 
01:28:56.950 --> 01:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
our expense i mean
 
01:28:59.750 --> 01:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
the kids know that this
 
01:29:01.990 --> 01:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
the vaccine
 
01:29:03.430 --> 01:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
well it doesn't work let's face it it
 
01:29:04.790 --> 01:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
does not work
 
01:29:06.070 --> 01:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
and i'm driving here this morning
 
01:29:08.310 --> 01:29:08.320 align:start position:0%
listening to an advertisement for pfizer
 
01:29:11.110 --> 01:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
now has a double shot dose for six month
 
01:29:12.629 --> 01:29:12.639 align:start position:0%
old babies
 
01:29:14.390 --> 01:29:14.400 align:start position:0%
this is out of control
 
01:29:16.390 --> 01:29:16.400 align:start position:0%
but no i don't know how kathy the
 
01:29:18.310 --> 01:29:18.320 align:start position:0%
advocate i'm i'm actually looking into
 
01:29:19.189 --> 01:29:19.199 align:start position:0%
this mike
 
01:29:21.030 --> 01:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
you know how kids are dad stay away stay
 
01:29:22.790 --> 01:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
away don't get involved don't you know
 
01:29:25.990 --> 01:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
but i'm concerned that an advocate would
 
01:29:29.990 --> 01:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:31.669 --> 01:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much are there
 
01:29:33.110 --> 01:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
01:29:35.590 --> 01:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you very much
 
01:29:48.629 --> 01:29:48.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:50.709 --> 01:29:50.719 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is carla smith i'm
 
01:29:52.709 --> 01:29:52.719 align:start position:0%
a registered nurse i'm here representing
 
01:29:54.629 --> 01:29:54.639 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire nurses association and
 
01:29:56.870 --> 01:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
we are in opposition of this bill
 
01:29:58.709 --> 01:29:58.719 align:start position:0%
i would also like to share with you my
 
01:30:01.030 --> 01:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
personal perspective today i am a
 
01:30:03.590 --> 01:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
professor of nursing in new hampshire
 
01:30:06.790 --> 01:30:06.800 align:start position:0%
i work at a private university and quite
 
01:30:08.310 --> 01:30:08.320 align:start position:0%
in contrast
 
01:30:10.550 --> 01:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
we have very strict
 
01:30:12.629 --> 01:30:12.639 align:start position:0%
restrictions on our campus
 
01:30:14.470 --> 01:30:14.480 align:start position:0%
we do require masking
 
01:30:16.390 --> 01:30:16.400 align:start position:0%
we require vaccination unless you have
 
01:30:18.149 --> 01:30:18.159 align:start position:0%
an exemption in place
 
01:30:21.189 --> 01:30:21.199 align:start position:0%
we require weekly testing
 
01:30:23.830 --> 01:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
the community system and unh system here
 
01:30:25.430 --> 01:30:25.440 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire i they just want
 
01:30:27.270 --> 01:30:27.280 align:start position:0%
flexibility they're not asking to go to
 
01:30:28.870 --> 01:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
this strict rigid
 
01:30:31.590 --> 01:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
form that i live every day
 
01:30:34.870 --> 01:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
i had my pcr test done on on monday so i
 
01:30:36.390 --> 01:30:36.400 align:start position:0%
could be cleared to be safe to be in
 
01:30:37.990 --> 01:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
campus and therefore i'm safe to be here
 
01:30:39.830 --> 01:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
with you today
 
01:30:41.189 --> 01:30:41.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't bother me
 
01:30:43.990 --> 01:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
i have 129 nursing students in my
 
01:30:45.590 --> 01:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
program right now
 
01:30:48.629 --> 01:30:48.639 align:start position:0%
we haven't lost a single one with the
 
01:30:50.310 --> 01:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
most stringent restrictions there could
 
01:30:52.229 --> 01:30:52.239 align:start position:0%
possibly be
 
01:30:54.070 --> 01:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
i have two students that do have
 
01:30:56.229 --> 01:30:56.239 align:start position:0%
exemptions for vaccines
 
01:30:57.750 --> 01:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
we have worked with them to find them
 
01:31:00.390 --> 01:31:00.400 align:start position:0%
clinical sites and opportunities
 
01:31:02.390 --> 01:31:02.400 align:start position:0%
that still fit within the course
 
01:31:03.990 --> 01:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
objectives because that's very important
 
01:31:06.149 --> 01:31:06.159 align:start position:0%
you can't just send a nurse a student
 
01:31:08.149 --> 01:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
anywhere to complete these clinical
 
01:31:09.669 --> 01:31:09.679 align:start position:0%
hours it has to meet their course and
 
01:31:12.070 --> 01:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
their learning objectives
 
01:31:13.510 --> 01:31:13.520 align:start position:0%
but we've been able to find those
 
01:31:15.990 --> 01:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
exceptions for them
 
01:31:17.830 --> 01:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
having a mask mandate or having a
 
01:31:20.550 --> 01:31:20.560 align:start position:0%
vaccine policy has not restricted their
 
01:31:22.870 --> 01:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
learning in any way
 
01:31:24.470 --> 01:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
and like i said we haven't lost any
 
01:31:25.990 --> 01:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
students if anything our program has
 
01:31:27.350 --> 01:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
only grown
 
01:31:29.430 --> 01:31:29.440 align:start position:0%
because they truly want to be part of
 
01:31:32.149 --> 01:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
this workforce solution this nursing
 
01:31:37.350 --> 01:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:39.350 --> 01:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
with all of these restrictions i have to
 
01:31:41.750 --> 01:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
tell you i feel the safest
 
01:31:44.550 --> 01:31:44.560 align:start position:0%
on campus than i do anywhere else i feel
 
01:31:46.310 --> 01:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
safer going to work
 
01:31:48.709 --> 01:31:48.719 align:start position:0%
than i do going to the grocery store
 
01:31:50.550 --> 01:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
going to the gas station
 
01:31:54.470 --> 01:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:58.709 --> 01:31:58.719 align:start position:0%
it's not a burden it's only a help
 
01:32:00.550 --> 01:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
in contrast to some of the comments that
 
01:32:01.910 --> 01:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
have been made
 
01:32:05.510 --> 01:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
by previous speakers today
 
01:32:07.430 --> 01:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
yes these systems are funded by public
 
01:32:09.189 --> 01:32:09.199 align:start position:0%
tax dollars but you know what what else
 
01:32:10.950 --> 01:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
do we fund with public tax dollars we
 
01:32:13.350 --> 01:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
fund our military systems we fund our
 
01:32:15.990 --> 01:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officers
 
01:32:17.510 --> 01:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
body armor
 
01:32:21.510 --> 01:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
bulletproof vests those are all tools
 
01:32:23.030 --> 01:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
that prevent
 
01:32:25.110 --> 01:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
or help to prevent
 
01:32:27.430 --> 01:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
a devastating injury
 
01:32:30.550 --> 01:32:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:32.390 --> 01:32:32.400 align:start position:0%
would we defund that
 
01:32:34.390 --> 01:32:34.400 align:start position:0%
may not stop them
 
01:32:36.390 --> 01:32:36.400 align:start position:0%
from becoming hurt
 
01:32:37.910 --> 01:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
but you know what it's going to prevent
 
01:32:40.229 --> 01:32:40.239 align:start position:0%
them from having that mortality and
 
01:32:41.669 --> 01:32:41.679 align:start position:0%
that's what masks do that's what
 
01:32:43.270 --> 01:32:43.280 align:start position:0%
vaccines do no one's saying that they
 
01:32:46.629 --> 01:32:46.639 align:start position:0%
can 100 stop the spread of covet
 
01:32:49.990 --> 01:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
but they certainly minimize that risk
 
01:32:51.189 --> 01:32:51.199 align:start position:0%
i think that's something that's
 
01:32:53.830 --> 01:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
important to to consider if you can
 
01:32:56.470 --> 01:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
minimize risk why are we taking that
 
01:33:01.350 --> 01:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:03.669 --> 01:33:03.679 align:start position:0%
i think that's very important to know
 
01:33:05.990 --> 01:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
lastly i want to share some
 
01:33:07.910 --> 01:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
financial perspective that i think is
 
01:33:10.550 --> 01:33:10.560 align:start position:0%
worth considering i got my research from
 
01:33:12.470 --> 01:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
becker's hospital review it's considered
 
01:33:16.550 --> 01:33:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:18.550 --> 01:33:18.560 align:start position:0%
they broke down the cost of a coveted
 
01:33:21.350 --> 01:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
hospitalization case by each state
 
01:33:23.750 --> 01:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
this research was published in december
 
01:33:25.830 --> 01:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire a complex
 
01:33:27.910 --> 01:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
coveted hospitalization
 
01:33:29.510 --> 01:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
that means the person's admitted to the
 
01:33:31.750 --> 01:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
hospital has received icu treatment and
 
01:33:33.550 --> 01:33:33.560 align:start position:0%
is intubated
 
01:33:37.590 --> 01:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
256 thousand dollars
 
01:33:40.070 --> 01:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
the average cost for a non-complex case
 
01:33:41.270 --> 01:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
meaning they were admitted to the
 
01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:42.470 align:start position:0%
meaning they were admitted to the
hospital

01:33:42.470 --> 01:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
01:33:44.149 --> 01:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
maybe on a general floor needed some
 
01:33:46.149 --> 01:33:46.159 align:start position:0%
respiratory support some oxygen but did
 
01:33:48.310 --> 01:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
not require icu or do not require
 
01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:49.669 align:start position:0%
not require icu or do not require
intubation

01:33:49.669 --> 01:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
intubation
 
01:33:53.110 --> 01:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
sixty two thousand dollars
 
01:33:54.790 --> 01:33:54.800 align:start position:0%
sixty two thousand dollars that's more
 
01:33:56.149 --> 01:33:56.159 align:start position:0%
than the average teacher makes in new
 
01:33:56.159 --> 01:33:57.750 align:start position:0%
than the average teacher makes in new
hampshire

01:33:57.750 --> 01:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:33:59.430 --> 01:33:59.440 align:start position:0%
two hundred fifty six thousand dollars i
 
01:34:01.510 --> 01:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
could go buy a house
 
01:34:03.830 --> 01:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
if we can minimize
 
01:34:05.990 --> 01:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
these costs and that's what vaccinations
 
01:34:08.070 --> 01:34:08.080 align:start position:0%
do that's what masks do they decrease
 
01:34:10.470 --> 01:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
the risk
 
01:34:12.629 --> 01:34:12.639 align:start position:0%
as for these super spreader parties
 
01:34:13.830 --> 01:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
would you have your children play
 
01:34:16.550 --> 01:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
russian roulette
 
01:34:18.390 --> 01:34:18.400 align:start position:0%
just because they can because they can
 
01:34:21.110 --> 01:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
get together it's really a gamble
 
01:34:22.709 --> 01:34:22.719 align:start position:0%
i think it's very important that we
 
01:34:24.470 --> 01:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
allow these universities to have the
 
01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:27.110 align:start position:0%
allow these universities to have the
flexibility

01:34:27.110 --> 01:34:27.120 align:start position:0%
flexibility
 
01:34:29.350 --> 01:34:29.360 align:start position:0%
to institute these mask policies or a
 
01:34:32.629 --> 01:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
vaccination policy if they feel it's fit
 
01:34:35.030 --> 01:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
to safeguard their community
 
01:34:36.790 --> 01:34:36.800 align:start position:0%
and have the best health outcomes thank
 
01:34:39.669 --> 01:34:39.679 align:start position:0%
you thank you are there questions
 
01:34:41.750 --> 01:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
not seeing any hands thank you
 
01:34:44.629 --> 01:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:48.229 --> 01:34:48.239 align:start position:0%
i'm just curious as to how much um
 
01:34:51.109 --> 01:34:51.119 align:start position:0%
you've seen of covet on your campus
 
01:34:52.950 --> 01:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
we have seen it but i have to say it's
 
01:34:55.270 --> 01:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
been very little the last time i looked
 
01:34:57.109 --> 01:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
up our positivity rate was less than
 
01:34:59.510 --> 01:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
three percent thank you you're welcome
 
01:35:00.950 --> 01:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
01:35:03.030 --> 01:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you very much
 
01:35:15.070 --> 01:35:15.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:18.229 --> 01:35:18.239 align:start position:0%
kathleens and tavi dover new hampshire
 
01:35:22.310 --> 01:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
and i'm speaking in support of this bill
 
01:35:24.310 --> 01:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
our students when they go away to
 
01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:26.790 align:start position:0%
our students when they go away to
college

01:35:26.790 --> 01:35:26.800 align:start position:0%
college
 
01:35:31.270 --> 01:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
are able to drive handle their finances
 
01:35:34.149 --> 01:35:34.159 align:start position:0%
do research of all types
 
01:35:36.310 --> 01:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
so they are asked to make adult
 
01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:37.590 align:start position:0%
so they are asked to make adult
decisions

01:35:37.590 --> 01:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
01:35:40.470 --> 01:35:40.480 align:start position:0%
day in and day out
 
01:35:43.109 --> 01:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
whether or not to wear a face mask
 
01:35:46.470 --> 01:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
is an adult decision that certainly this
 
01:35:47.750 --> 01:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
age group
 
01:35:51.030 --> 01:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
should be able to do based upon the
 
01:35:54.070 --> 01:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
research that is available at that point
 
01:35:55.750 --> 01:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
in time
 
01:35:58.070 --> 01:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
also based upon
 
01:35:59.910 --> 01:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
what i have read
 
01:36:02.629 --> 01:36:02.639 align:start position:0%
this age group is the most healthy age
 
01:36:04.229 --> 01:36:04.239 align:start position:0%
group of all
 
01:36:07.669 --> 01:36:07.679 align:start position:0%
and the least likely to have bad effects
 
01:36:11.350 --> 01:36:11.360 align:start position:0%
from contracting covet
 
01:36:13.910 --> 01:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
what we do then is we will draw their
 
01:36:16.709 --> 01:36:16.719 align:start position:0%
blood and use it to create
 
01:36:19.030 --> 01:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
the antibody plasma
 
01:36:22.870 --> 01:36:22.880 align:start position:0%
that we give to people who are older or
 
01:36:25.910 --> 01:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
have very adverse effects to help get
 
01:36:25.920 --> 01:36:26.709 align:start position:0%
have very adverse effects to help get
them

01:36:26.709 --> 01:36:26.719 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:36:30.870 --> 01:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
over the hump of their illness
 
01:36:33.430 --> 01:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
the only according to what i have read
 
01:36:37.109 --> 01:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
the only face mask that actually works
 
01:36:41.350 --> 01:36:41.360 align:start position:0%
for the teeny tiny particles that are
 
01:36:45.350 --> 01:36:45.360 align:start position:0%
the virus it's an n95 that is properly
 
01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:46.790 align:start position:0%
the virus it's an n95 that is properly
fitted

01:36:46.790 --> 01:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
fitted
 
01:36:48.790 --> 01:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
i don't know if anyone in this room has
 
01:36:51.950 --> 01:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
an n95 mask on but i do it is my
 
01:36:54.709 --> 01:36:54.719 align:start position:0%
understanding that they are difficult to
 
01:36:57.430 --> 01:36:57.440 align:start position:0%
come across and from what i've read
 
01:37:01.990 --> 01:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
cloth masks really do not do a lot of
 
01:37:04.870 --> 01:37:04.880 align:start position:0%
good that they may help you for a few
 
01:37:08.870 --> 01:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
minutes if somebody is close by but
 
01:37:11.830 --> 01:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
in between the fibers those little tiny
 
01:37:14.070 --> 01:37:14.080 align:start position:0%
particles of
 
01:37:17.030 --> 01:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
illness will go right through
 
01:37:18.950 --> 01:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
the fabric
 
01:37:20.470 --> 01:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
the cdc
 
01:37:22.470 --> 01:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
yes they do get more and more
 
01:37:22.480 --> 01:37:23.830 align:start position:0%
yes they do get more and more
information

01:37:23.830 --> 01:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:37:26.229 --> 01:37:26.239 align:start position:0%
but they are also not all that good in
 
01:37:28.390 --> 01:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
getting the information out in an
 
01:37:31.430 --> 01:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
understandable way to the public and
 
01:37:35.750 --> 01:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
what has happened is a loss of trust in
 
01:37:39.270 --> 01:37:39.280 align:start position:0%
what they are putting out there
 
01:37:40.950 --> 01:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
my concern
 
01:37:43.350 --> 01:37:43.360 align:start position:0%
are students who are on the autistic
 
01:37:43.360 --> 01:37:44.470 align:start position:0%
are students who are on the autistic
spectrum

01:37:44.470 --> 01:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
spectrum
 
01:37:47.910 --> 01:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
students who are deaf students who have
 
01:37:51.270 --> 01:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
504 or iep plans who are in the
 
01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:52.629 align:start position:0%
504 or iep plans who are in the
university

01:37:52.629 --> 01:37:52.639 align:start position:0%
university
 
01:37:55.990 --> 01:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
who may need to read lips or who may not
 
01:37:59.109 --> 01:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
be able to have a face covering on but
 
01:38:02.070 --> 01:38:02.080 align:start position:0%
yet we are requiring it so what are we
 
01:38:05.669 --> 01:38:05.679 align:start position:0%
doing i have not heard accommodations
 
01:38:07.910 --> 01:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
that are being made for this type of
 
01:38:10.070 --> 01:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
student who would like to attend the
 
01:38:14.070 --> 01:38:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:17.030 --> 01:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
vaccines should be they are
 
01:38:20.390 --> 01:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
a choice that people should make
 
01:38:23.109 --> 01:38:23.119 align:start position:0%
regarding their own health
 
01:38:25.830 --> 01:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
from what i've read the vaccines do not
 
01:38:29.270 --> 01:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
work against the omicron variant which
 
01:38:32.390 --> 01:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
is a far weaker variant than previous
 
01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:33.830 align:start position:0%
is a far weaker variant than previous
strains

01:38:33.830 --> 01:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
strains
 
01:38:36.790 --> 01:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
and that it is not as deadly or as
 
01:38:39.990 --> 01:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
lethal for many people and i have
 
01:38:43.109 --> 01:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
friends right now who have this who have
 
01:38:47.590 --> 01:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
been triple vaccinated who do wear masks
 
01:38:49.910 --> 01:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
but they still i have two friends that i
 
01:38:52.790 --> 01:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
get emails from this morning who have
 
01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:53.910 align:start position:0%
get emails from this morning who have
this

01:38:53.910 --> 01:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:38:56.709 --> 01:38:56.719 align:start position:0%
so it's telling me that you're asking
 
01:38:59.510 --> 01:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
people or requiring people to put a
 
01:39:01.910 --> 01:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
vaccine in their body that they don't
 
01:39:04.790 --> 01:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
know what the long-term effects are and
 
01:39:08.709 --> 01:39:08.719 align:start position:0%
yet it is not working universally like
 
01:39:13.350 --> 01:39:13.360 align:start position:0%
it was put out to do originally
 
01:39:16.310 --> 01:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
so we have a lot of unknown effects for
 
01:39:19.430 --> 01:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
the vaccine but i'm just wondering why
 
01:39:21.510 --> 01:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
the government is saying we have to wait
 
01:39:25.990 --> 01:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
55 years to read the data from moderna
 
01:39:28.870 --> 01:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
pfizer and johnson and johnson
 
01:39:31.669 --> 01:39:31.679 align:start position:0%
why is that being withheld from the
 
01:39:31.679 --> 01:39:32.709 align:start position:0%
why is that being withheld from the
public

01:39:32.709 --> 01:39:32.719 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:39:36.709 --> 01:39:36.719 align:start position:0%
if there are no ill effects to this
 
01:39:36.719 --> 01:39:37.510 align:start position:0%
if there are no ill effects to this
so

01:39:37.510 --> 01:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:39:41.750 --> 01:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
i am hoping that you will strongly
 
01:39:44.070 --> 01:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
consider giving back
 
01:39:47.750 --> 01:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
freedom to our young adults so that they
 
01:39:50.390 --> 01:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
will further learn their rights and
 
01:39:52.870 --> 01:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
responsibilities in the great state of
 
01:39:54.790 --> 01:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:39:55.910 --> 01:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:39:57.669 --> 01:39:57.679 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
 
01:39:57.679 --> 01:39:58.709 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
committee

01:39:58.709 --> 01:39:58.719 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:40:03.350 --> 01:40:03.360 align:start position:0%

01:40:16.470 --> 01:40:16.480 align:start position:0%
hello thank you for having me my name is
 
01:40:18.709 --> 01:40:18.719 align:start position:0%
heath howard i'm a resident of stratford
 
01:40:21.270 --> 01:40:21.280 align:start position:0%
a lifelong resident of new hampshire i
 
01:40:22.790 --> 01:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
am currently a junior at the university
 
01:40:24.790 --> 01:40:24.800 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
01:40:27.270 --> 01:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
i am quite appalled by the bill that has
 
01:40:29.030 --> 01:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
been proposed
 
01:40:32.149 --> 01:40:32.159 align:start position:0%
before us and i feel strongly that it
 
01:40:33.510 --> 01:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
undermines the health and safety
 
01:40:35.990 --> 01:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
initiatives that the university system
 
01:40:39.350 --> 01:40:39.360 align:start position:0%
has put in place to protect our students
 
01:40:41.430 --> 01:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
i know personally that some of the
 
01:40:43.350 --> 01:40:43.360 align:start position:0%
infrastructure at the university of new
 
01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:44.229 align:start position:0%
infrastructure at the university of new
hampshire

01:40:44.229 --> 01:40:44.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:40:46.950 --> 01:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
allows for more cramped classrooms than
 
01:40:49.510 --> 01:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
would be preferred
 
01:40:50.790 --> 01:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
allowing for
 
01:40:53.750 --> 01:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
the prevention of uh social distancing
 
01:40:55.669 --> 01:40:55.679 align:start position:0%
meaning that masks are really the front
 
01:40:58.629 --> 01:40:58.639 align:start position:0%
line of protection among students
 
01:41:01.750 --> 01:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh personally i know some uh
 
01:41:04.229 --> 01:41:04.239 align:start position:0%
some of my friends who have hearing
 
01:41:06.950 --> 01:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
disabilities who are all for the mask
 
01:41:09.590 --> 01:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
mandate that is currently in place
 
01:41:11.270 --> 01:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
they do not struggle they have hearing
 
01:41:13.590 --> 01:41:13.600 align:start position:0%
aids and if necessary
 
01:41:16.790 --> 01:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
there are sas opportunities for students
 
01:41:20.550 --> 01:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:22.550 --> 01:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
i did want to address one thing one of
 
01:41:23.510 --> 01:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
the questions from one of the
 
01:41:26.950 --> 01:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
representatives about
 
01:41:29.270 --> 01:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
how students have been leaving the state
 
01:41:31.590 --> 01:41:31.600 align:start position:0%
i know that before covet even hit around
 
01:41:33.669 --> 01:41:33.679 align:start position:0%
60 percent of our high school graduates
 
01:41:35.430 --> 01:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
were leaving the state to attend
 
01:41:37.350 --> 01:41:37.360 align:start position:0%
out-of-state universities for those who
 
01:41:40.149 --> 01:41:40.159 align:start position:0%
were going on to pursue higher education
 
01:41:42.470 --> 01:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
and that's mostly due to the highest
 
01:41:43.830 --> 01:41:43.840 align:start position:0%
in-state tuition in the nation that we
 
01:41:45.750 --> 01:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
currently have
 
01:41:51.030 --> 01:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:52.629 --> 01:41:52.639 align:start position:0%
alongside that
 
01:41:54.709 --> 01:41:54.719 align:start position:0%
it's also important that we actually
 
01:41:54.719 --> 01:41:56.390 align:start position:0%
it's also important that we actually
have

01:41:56.390 --> 01:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:41:58.229 --> 01:41:58.239 align:start position:0%
protection among students
 
01:42:00.550 --> 01:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
and i feel strongly that you should vote
 
01:42:02.709 --> 01:42:02.719 align:start position:0%
against this bill thank you
 
01:42:04.950 --> 01:42:04.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there questions
 
01:42:07.910 --> 01:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:09.669 --> 01:42:09.679 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you very much for
 
01:42:10.950 --> 01:42:10.960 align:start position:0%
coming up today
 
01:42:13.350 --> 01:42:13.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:42:26.229 --> 01:42:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:28.629 --> 01:42:28.639 align:start position:0%
good morning everybody good morning
 
01:42:28.639 --> 01:42:29.430 align:start position:0%

um
 
01:42:32.310 --> 01:42:32.320 align:start position:0%
my name is jenny wilson and i am a
 
01:42:35.590 --> 01:42:35.600 align:start position:0%
resident of barrington new hampshire
 
01:42:38.470 --> 01:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
and i am here to speak in support of
 
01:42:40.070 --> 01:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:42:41.430 --> 01:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to make this very short
 
01:42:42.470 --> 01:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
and sweet
 
01:42:46.070 --> 01:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:48.470 --> 01:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
the reason i i decided to speak is
 
01:42:50.629 --> 01:42:50.639 align:start position:0%
because i want to share with you my own
 
01:42:52.790 --> 01:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
personal experience
 
01:42:54.950 --> 01:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
this is not anecdotal i didn't hear this
 
01:42:57.590 --> 01:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
from my neighbor or anybody else
 
01:42:59.030 --> 01:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
but my husband
 
01:43:02.149 --> 01:43:02.159 align:start position:0%
has had the two shots
 
01:43:04.550 --> 01:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
and uh just recently he got a phone call
 
01:43:06.470 --> 01:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
saying from his musical group one of
 
01:43:08.790 --> 01:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
them came down with covet and he said
 
01:43:10.709 --> 01:43:10.719 align:start position:0%
you need to test yourself
 
01:43:13.669 --> 01:43:13.679 align:start position:0%
when my husband was having the symptoms
 
01:43:16.550 --> 01:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
and he tested himself and he tested
 
01:43:16.560 --> 01:43:18.070 align:start position:0%
and he tested himself and he tested
positive

01:43:18.070 --> 01:43:18.080 align:start position:0%
positive
 
01:43:19.270 --> 01:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:43:21.990 --> 01:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
he looked at me and he said
 
01:43:24.390 --> 01:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
you better test yourself because i have
 
01:43:26.390 --> 01:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
not been vaccinated
 
01:43:27.830 --> 01:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
and i have not received any of the
 
01:43:27.840 --> 01:43:29.750 align:start position:0%
and i have not received any of the
vaccinations

01:43:29.750 --> 01:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
vaccinations
 
01:43:32.950 --> 01:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
so i said okay he went to the store and
 
01:43:35.350 --> 01:43:35.360 align:start position:0%
got four of the
 
01:43:37.350 --> 01:43:37.360 align:start position:0%
rapid tests
 
01:43:39.830 --> 01:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
he tested himself twice and both times
 
01:43:41.990 --> 01:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
he was positive
 
01:43:44.550 --> 01:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
i tested and i was negative
 
01:43:47.430 --> 01:43:47.440 align:start position:0%
this is my own personal experience
 
01:43:49.430 --> 01:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
we don't wear masks in the house we live
 
01:43:51.590 --> 01:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
together we're married to each other we
 
01:43:54.390 --> 01:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
don't keep six feet of distance
 
01:43:56.470 --> 01:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
and i hear all this information about
 
01:43:58.870 --> 01:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
being this virus being so deadly
 
01:44:01.830 --> 01:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
and so contagious that you have to stay
 
01:44:03.910 --> 01:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
away you have to wear a mask you have to
 
01:44:06.870 --> 01:44:06.880 align:start position:0%
wear two masks
 
01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:08.629 align:start position:0%
wear two masks
and

01:44:08.629 --> 01:44:08.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:44:11.270 --> 01:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
this is just my personal experience and
 
01:44:13.030 --> 01:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
i want to tell you i'm not a spring
 
01:44:15.430 --> 01:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
chicken i am just one year away from
 
01:44:17.590 --> 01:44:17.600 align:start position:0%
being 70.
 
01:44:17.600 --> 01:44:19.669 align:start position:0%
being 70.
so

01:44:19.669 --> 01:44:19.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:44:22.149 --> 01:44:22.159 align:start position:0%
you know i'm not like 25 years old that
 
01:44:24.070 --> 01:44:24.080 align:start position:0%
can you know leap tall buildings in a
 
01:44:25.750 --> 01:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
single bound so
 
01:44:28.149 --> 01:44:28.159 align:start position:0%
um just
 
01:44:29.669 --> 01:44:29.679 align:start position:0%
sharing this information with you and
 
01:44:32.950 --> 01:44:32.960 align:start position:0%
you can do with it what um you like but
 
01:44:34.629 --> 01:44:34.639 align:start position:0%
i think that masks don't do anything and
 
01:44:36.310 --> 01:44:36.320 align:start position:0%
vaccinations are
 
01:44:38.709 --> 01:44:38.719 align:start position:0%
pretty risky in my opinion that's why i
 
01:44:40.550 --> 01:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
haven't gotten mine
 
01:44:43.189 --> 01:44:43.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for hearing me
 
01:44:44.550 --> 01:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
01:44:46.550 --> 01:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
01:44:49.430 --> 01:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
70 is not a spring chicken
 
01:44:51.510 --> 01:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
very much a spring chicken
 
01:44:53.430 --> 01:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
wait till you get about six or seven on
 
01:44:55.910 --> 01:44:55.920 align:start position:0%

committee my name is sean locke
 
01:45:37.270 --> 01:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
i'm an assistant attorney general i
 
01:45:38.709 --> 01:45:38.719 align:start position:0%
direct the attorney general's civil
 
01:45:40.550 --> 01:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
rights unit i'm here on behalf of the
 
01:45:41.430 --> 01:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
attorney general to provide
 
01:45:43.510 --> 01:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
informational testimony so to be clear
 
01:45:45.350 --> 01:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
the ag does not take a position on the
 
01:45:47.350 --> 01:45:47.360 align:start position:0%
underlying policy
 
01:45:48.790 --> 01:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
but asks particularly if the committee
 
01:45:50.070 --> 01:45:50.080 align:start position:0%
is considering an ought to pass
 
01:45:51.910 --> 01:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
recommendation that the committee bear
 
01:45:53.270 --> 01:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
in mind
 
01:45:55.590 --> 01:45:55.600 align:start position:0%
the need for schools of all types to
 
01:45:57.590 --> 01:45:57.600 align:start position:0%
protect and accommodate the needs of
 
01:45:59.270 --> 01:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
students with disabilities
 
01:46:00.709 --> 01:46:00.719 align:start position:0%
as the committee may be aware states
 
01:46:02.790 --> 01:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
including iowa florida texas virgin and
 
01:46:05.030 --> 01:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
recently virginia have passed laws or
 
01:46:05.040 --> 01:46:05.910 align:start position:0%
recently virginia have passed laws or
issued

01:46:05.910 --> 01:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
issued
 
01:46:07.750 --> 01:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
orders prohibiting mass requirements or
 
01:46:09.669 --> 01:46:09.679 align:start position:0%
leaving mask wearing to the sole
 
01:46:11.669 --> 01:46:11.679 align:start position:0%
discretion of either students or the
 
01:46:14.390 --> 01:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
parents of students
 
01:46:15.990 --> 01:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
these laws have been challenged by
 
01:46:17.830 --> 01:46:17.840 align:start position:0%
parents disability rights advocates and
 
01:46:19.510 --> 01:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
the federal government
 
01:46:21.830 --> 01:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
as recently as last week the 8th circuit
 
01:46:23.270 --> 01:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
court of appeals
 
01:46:26.229 --> 01:46:26.239 align:start position:0%
found that schools need to consider
 
01:46:28.310 --> 01:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
01:46:29.910 --> 01:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
other students their need their
 
01:46:32.629 --> 01:46:32.639 align:start position:0%
expectation to wear masks to protect and
 
01:46:33.669 --> 01:46:33.679 align:start position:0%
accommodate their peers with
 
01:46:33.679 --> 01:46:35.030 align:start position:0%
accommodate their peers with
disabilities

01:46:35.030 --> 01:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
disabilities
 
01:46:37.030 --> 01:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
yes comes because the legislation has
 
01:46:38.870 --> 01:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
currently drafted may cause confusion
 
01:46:40.709 --> 01:46:40.719 align:start position:0%
for schools in determining how to follow
 
01:46:43.270 --> 01:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
this law while also protecting students
 
01:46:45.350 --> 01:46:45.360 align:start position:0%
with disabilities as they need to under
 
01:46:47.109 --> 01:46:47.119 align:start position:0%
other state law the americans with
 
01:46:48.950 --> 01:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
disabilities act and the rehabilitation
 
01:46:48.960 --> 01:46:49.669 align:start position:0%
disabilities act and the rehabilitation
act

01:46:49.669 --> 01:46:49.679 align:start position:0%
act
 
01:46:49.679 --> 01:46:50.390 align:start position:0%
act
and

01:46:50.390 --> 01:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:46:52.149 --> 01:46:52.159 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions it's also a
 
01:46:53.350 --> 01:46:53.360 align:start position:0%
theme you'll probably hear multiple
 
01:46:54.870 --> 01:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
times for me over the coming weeks as
 
01:46:56.870 --> 01:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
there are other mass legislation before
 
01:46:58.310 --> 01:46:58.320 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you uh
 
01:47:00.470 --> 01:47:00.480 align:start position:0%

thank you very much mr chair thank you

joining us this morning
 
01:47:09.750 --> 01:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
um do um would a uh would a compromised
 
01:47:12.629 --> 01:47:12.639 align:start position:0%
immune system be considered a disability
 
01:47:14.149 --> 01:47:14.159 align:start position:0%
it could be unders and so one thing i
 
01:47:15.830 --> 01:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
will say about the accommodation process
 
01:47:17.990 --> 01:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
it's a fact intensive process so
 
01:47:19.270 --> 01:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
i'll do my best to kind of answer
 
01:47:20.870 --> 01:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
hypotheticals but i can't necessarily
 
01:47:23.030 --> 01:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
speak in absolutes but yes there are
 
01:47:24.310 --> 01:47:24.320 align:start position:0%
circumstances where that could be a
 
01:47:24.320 --> 01:47:25.590 align:start position:0%
circumstances where that could be a
disability

01:47:25.590 --> 01:47:25.600 align:start position:0%
disability
 
01:47:28.310 --> 01:47:28.320 align:start position:0%
thank you on a follow-up yes would um
 
01:47:29.430 --> 01:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
would all
 
01:47:32.550 --> 01:47:32.560 align:start position:0%
um state regulations or state laws be an
 
01:47:34.390 --> 01:47:34.400 align:start position:0%
infringement on civil rights and if you
 
01:47:37.270 --> 01:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
could give us an example of um maybe one
 
01:47:39.109 --> 01:47:39.119 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:47:39.119 --> 01:47:40.470 align:start position:0%
that is
um

01:47:40.470 --> 01:47:40.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:42.070 --> 01:47:42.080 align:start position:0%
sorry uh
 
01:47:44.149 --> 01:47:44.159 align:start position:0%
not necessarily so
 
01:47:45.750 --> 01:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
in general the way particularly the
 
01:47:47.350 --> 01:47:47.360 align:start position:0%
americans with disabilities act but also
 
01:47:49.270 --> 01:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
state law i mean the accommodation
 
01:47:50.709 --> 01:47:50.719 align:start position:0%
process would be
 
01:47:52.629 --> 01:47:52.639 align:start position:0%
the ability to in you know so a person
 
01:47:54.629 --> 01:47:54.639 align:start position:0%
with a disability say i need an
 
01:47:56.229 --> 01:47:56.239 align:start position:0%
exemption or i need an adjustment to a
 
01:47:58.790 --> 01:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
particular policy practice uh as a
 
01:48:01.270 --> 01:48:01.280 align:start position:0%
result of my disability and so then
 
01:48:02.550 --> 01:48:02.560 align:start position:0%
depending on the circumstances there
 
01:48:04.629 --> 01:48:04.639 align:start position:0%
could be an engagement with whoever has
 
01:48:05.990 --> 01:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
imposed the requirement whether it's an
 
01:48:08.070 --> 01:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
employer whether it's a school
 
01:48:09.590 --> 01:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
to determine what an appropriate
 
01:48:10.950 --> 01:48:10.960 align:start position:0%
accommodation may be under the
 
01:48:13.830 --> 01:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
circumstances and so certainly you know
 
01:48:15.109 --> 01:48:15.119 align:start position:0%
under this law that could be something
 
01:48:17.109 --> 01:48:17.119 align:start position:0%
that happens the concern is more the
 
01:48:18.470 --> 01:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
confusion that it could create where you
 
01:48:19.910 --> 01:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
have a law that says you can't require
 
01:48:21.270 --> 01:48:21.280 align:start position:0%
masks but then you have laws that say
 
01:48:22.629 --> 01:48:22.639 align:start position:0%
well you need to accommodate students
 
01:48:25.030 --> 01:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
with disabilities and and kind of giving
 
01:48:27.350 --> 01:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
making sure that it's clear that you
 
01:48:29.430 --> 01:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
know both things can occur at the same
 
01:48:29.440 --> 01:48:31.109 align:start position:0%
know both things can occur at the same
time

01:48:31.109 --> 01:48:31.119 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:48:33.750 --> 01:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
up one follow up on this and and are you
 
01:48:36.950 --> 01:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
aware if um if those um accommodations
 
01:48:39.510 --> 01:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
as you've uh discussed here are in fact
 
01:48:41.910 --> 01:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
not being um um
 
01:48:44.229 --> 01:48:44.239 align:start position:0%
uh integrated in with the um
 
01:48:45.830 --> 01:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
with the requirements that the
 
01:48:47.109 --> 01:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
university system and the community
 
01:48:49.590 --> 01:48:49.600 align:start position:0%
college system are um are have in place
 
01:48:51.350 --> 01:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
today i certainly haven't received
 
01:48:52.310 --> 01:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
complaints with respect to the
 
01:48:54.149 --> 01:48:54.159 align:start position:0%
university system or the community
 
01:48:55.910 --> 01:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
college system with respect for in our
 
01:48:57.830 --> 01:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
office and i would have to kind of defer
 
01:48:59.189 --> 01:48:59.199 align:start position:0%
to other agencies about whether or not
 
01:49:00.629 --> 01:49:00.639 align:start position:0%
they've received similar complaints but
 
01:49:00.639 --> 01:49:01.430 align:start position:0%
they've received similar complaints but
where

01:49:01.430 --> 01:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:49:02.629 --> 01:49:02.639 align:start position:0%
they're expecting mass i haven't
 
01:49:03.910 --> 01:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
received complaints that masks are
 
01:49:05.910 --> 01:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
infringing on anybody's rights as people
 
01:49:07.669 --> 01:49:07.679 align:start position:0%
with disabilities
 
01:49:09.669 --> 01:49:09.679 align:start position:0%
representative porter
 
01:49:11.430 --> 01:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair this is a question
 
01:49:13.430 --> 01:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
that's been percolating in my mind as
 
01:49:14.709 --> 01:49:14.719 align:start position:0%
i've been listening
 
01:49:16.790 --> 01:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
so right now we're hearing a lot about
 
01:49:18.709 --> 01:49:18.719 align:start position:0%
the coveted vaccine and
 
01:49:21.350 --> 01:49:21.360 align:start position:0%
masks and that maybe not being effective
 
01:49:21.360 --> 01:49:22.310 align:start position:0%
masks and that maybe not being effective
for

01:49:22.310 --> 01:49:22.320 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:49:24.950 --> 01:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
for transmission of covert but if in the
 
01:49:28.870 --> 01:49:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:31.589 --> 01:49:31.599 align:start position:0%
illness would have happened where we
 
01:49:31.599 --> 01:49:32.390 align:start position:0%
illness would have happened where we
knew

01:49:32.390 --> 01:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
knew
 
01:49:34.950 --> 01:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
for sure that the vaccine would prevent
 
01:49:37.189 --> 01:49:37.199 align:start position:0%
it and we knew for sure
 
01:49:38.870 --> 01:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
that wearing a mask would prevent
 
01:49:41.750 --> 01:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
transmission would having this
 
01:49:43.910 --> 01:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
language in place
 
01:49:46.390 --> 01:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
prevent the universities and and
 
01:49:46.400 --> 01:49:47.750 align:start position:0%
prevent the universities and and
colleges

01:49:47.750 --> 01:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
colleges
 
01:49:51.830 --> 01:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
from implementing or requiring those
 
01:49:53.350 --> 01:49:53.360 align:start position:0%
so my
 
01:49:54.709 --> 01:49:54.719 align:start position:0%
you follow where i'm going yes i'm
 
01:49:54.719 --> 01:49:55.990 align:start position:0%
you follow where i'm going yes i'm
looking

01:49:55.990 --> 01:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
looking
 
01:49:56.950 --> 01:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:49:59.510 --> 01:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
we're here but 10 years from now
 
01:50:01.030 --> 01:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen if this is in
 
01:50:03.189 --> 01:50:03.199 align:start position:0%
place right and so my read of the
 
01:50:05.189 --> 01:50:05.199 align:start position:0%
legislation would be
 
01:50:06.629 --> 01:50:06.639 align:start position:0%
at least with respect to the vaccine
 
01:50:09.030 --> 01:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
requirement is explicitly to the covet
 
01:50:11.270 --> 01:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
19 vaccine so if there's a future
 
01:50:13.430 --> 01:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
disease or a vaccine work this law may
 
01:50:14.950 --> 01:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
not apply but i'm pretty i'm fairly
 
01:50:15.990 --> 01:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
certain if i
 
01:50:17.350 --> 01:50:17.360 align:start position:0%
please correct me if i'm wrong that it
 
01:50:17.360 --> 01:50:18.390 align:start position:0%
please correct me if i'm wrong that it
says

01:50:18.390 --> 01:50:18.400 align:start position:0%
says
 
01:50:20.950 --> 01:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
covet related vaccines but for mass
 
01:50:22.629 --> 01:50:22.639 align:start position:0%
requirements that's that seems absolute
 
01:50:24.310 --> 01:50:24.320 align:start position:0%
it doesn't it's not just limited to
 
01:50:26.470 --> 01:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
preventing transmission of covet so it
 
01:50:28.790 --> 01:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
could be a concern that arises in
 
01:50:31.189 --> 01:50:31.199 align:start position:0%
if there was a future disease
 
01:50:33.350 --> 01:50:33.360 align:start position:0%
thank you i have a question
 
01:50:35.030 --> 01:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
i could take you to john farmela maybe
 
01:50:38.790 --> 01:50:38.800 align:start position:0%
but uh i'll i'll deal with you uh
 
01:50:40.550 --> 01:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
the issue of
 
01:50:43.270 --> 01:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
eliminating state funds
 
01:50:45.750 --> 01:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
if mass are required we know that in
 
01:50:47.990 --> 01:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
certain situations we've heard that word
 
01:50:51.589 --> 01:50:51.599 align:start position:0%
circumstances that they're required
 
01:50:54.149 --> 01:50:54.159 align:start position:0%
is there potential for suits to come
 
01:50:56.629 --> 01:50:56.639 align:start position:0%
back against the state
 
01:50:56.639 --> 01:50:57.589 align:start position:0%
back against the state
for

01:50:57.589 --> 01:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:51:00.550 --> 01:51:00.560 align:start position:0%
loss of scholarship money that's paid
 
01:51:03.510 --> 01:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:04.870 --> 01:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
revenues which go to either the
 
01:51:06.310 --> 01:51:06.320 align:start position:0%
community college system or the
 
01:51:08.229 --> 01:51:08.239 align:start position:0%
university system in new hampshire or
 
01:51:11.990 --> 01:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
other like situations where
 
01:51:14.870 --> 01:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
we are now discriminating against a
 
01:51:16.470 --> 01:51:16.480 align:start position:0%
person that maybe doesn't have the
 
01:51:18.830 --> 01:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
wherewithal to
 
01:51:18.840 --> 01:51:20.390 align:start position:0%
wherewithal to
attend

01:51:20.390 --> 01:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
attend
 
01:51:22.229 --> 01:51:22.239 align:start position:0%
so let me make sure i understand your
 
01:51:23.830 --> 01:51:23.840 align:start position:0%
correct question correctly before i
 
01:51:25.430 --> 01:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
answer so you're you're kind of
 
01:51:27.589 --> 01:51:27.599 align:start position:0%
describing a situation where state funds
 
01:51:29.830 --> 01:51:29.840 align:start position:0%
are used to pay a scholarship to a
 
01:51:31.430 --> 01:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
particular student and they're choosing
 
01:51:33.430 --> 01:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
to go to the university that was just
 
01:51:36.149 --> 01:51:36.159 align:start position:0%
one example of possibly how state monies
 
01:51:39.589 --> 01:51:39.599 align:start position:0%
could be used right um so i'm i'm and
 
01:51:41.430 --> 01:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
with the this
 
01:51:43.189 --> 01:51:43.199 align:start position:0%
if a a
 
01:51:45.270 --> 01:51:45.280 align:start position:0%
system or institution within the other
 
01:51:45.280 --> 01:51:46.790 align:start position:0%
system or institution within the other
system

01:51:46.790 --> 01:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:51:48.950 --> 01:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
decide we are going to go have continue
 
01:51:51.350 --> 01:51:51.360 align:start position:0%
this mandate whereas and if this bill
 
01:51:54.310 --> 01:51:54.320 align:start position:0%
pat were to pass would we then have you
 
01:51:54.320 --> 01:51:55.589 align:start position:0%
pat were to pass would we then have you
know

01:51:55.589 --> 01:51:55.599 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:51:57.990 --> 01:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
the that type of condition occur whether
 
01:51:59.430 --> 01:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
it be you know litigation brought
 
01:52:01.030 --> 01:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
against the state
 
01:52:03.350 --> 01:52:03.360 align:start position:0%
i don't because i mean the issue would
 
01:52:05.109 --> 01:52:05.119 align:start position:0%
have to one i highly doubt the
 
01:52:06.310 --> 01:52:06.320 align:start position:0%
university system or the community
 
01:52:08.229 --> 01:52:08.239 align:start position:0%
college system would would
 
01:52:09.750 --> 01:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
refuse all the state funding that they
 
01:52:11.589 --> 01:52:11.599 align:start position:0%
receive if the law were to pass but i
 
01:52:13.589 --> 01:52:13.599 align:start position:0%
won't speak for them but they
 
01:52:16.229 --> 01:52:16.239 align:start position:0%
but if you had a student so they want to
 
01:52:17.830 --> 01:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
use their scholarship at a university at
 
01:52:19.830 --> 01:52:19.840 align:start position:0%
a state university that's requiring a
 
01:52:21.750 --> 01:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
mass requirement with this lawn effect
 
01:52:22.870 --> 01:52:22.880 align:start position:0%
so the
 
01:52:24.709 --> 01:52:24.719 align:start position:0%
law itself would prohibit
 
01:52:26.550 --> 01:52:26.560 align:start position:0%
i apologize i'm thinking aloud as i'm
 
01:52:28.550 --> 01:52:28.560 align:start position:0%
saying this
 
01:52:30.870 --> 01:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
the law would prohibit
 
01:52:33.030 --> 01:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
state funds from going to the university
 
01:52:33.990 --> 01:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
and so the question would be basically
 
01:52:35.510 --> 01:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
would that scholarship have i guess it's
 
01:52:37.270 --> 01:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
two parts one would that scholarship
 
01:52:39.669 --> 01:52:39.679 align:start position:0%
have to be rescinded as a result of that
 
01:52:41.270 --> 01:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
choice and two
 
01:52:42.950 --> 01:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
what remedy the student would have if
 
01:52:44.709 --> 01:52:44.719 align:start position:0%
that scholarship would rescinded that's
 
01:52:46.070 --> 01:52:46.080 align:start position:0%
correct um
 
01:52:51.270 --> 01:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:53.189 --> 01:52:53.199 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i have i'd have to really
 
01:52:54.629 --> 01:52:54.639 align:start position:0%
think more about that particular
 
01:52:56.470 --> 01:52:56.480 align:start position:0%
question to answer it correctly or to
 
01:52:58.790 --> 01:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
give you kind of a more complete answer
 
01:52:58.800 --> 01:52:59.669 align:start position:0%
give you kind of a more complete answer
um

01:52:59.669 --> 01:52:59.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:01.350 --> 01:53:01.360 align:start position:0%
and just because the issue is kind of
 
01:53:02.870 --> 01:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
the student's choice and where they want
 
01:53:04.629 --> 01:53:04.639 align:start position:0%
to use that scholarship
 
01:53:06.390 --> 01:53:06.400 align:start position:0%
you know that that they may be able to
 
01:53:08.070 --> 01:53:08.080 align:start position:0%
use it in a different state if the
 
01:53:09.270 --> 01:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
program allows them to use in a
 
01:53:10.709 --> 01:53:10.719 align:start position:0%
different state or if it's exclusive to
 
01:53:12.550 --> 01:53:12.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire it really comes down to
 
01:53:13.990 --> 01:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
that students choices and kind of like
 
01:53:16.629 --> 01:53:16.639 align:start position:0%
this indirect funding a use of state
 
01:53:18.470 --> 01:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
funds into the university system i'm
 
01:53:20.870 --> 01:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
talking about the money which goes for
 
01:53:22.790 --> 01:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
in our operational budget goes directly
 
01:53:22.800 --> 01:53:23.510 align:start position:0%
in our operational budget goes directly
to

01:53:23.510 --> 01:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:53:26.629 --> 01:53:26.639 align:start position:0%
university system new hampshire right
 
01:53:28.709 --> 01:53:28.719 align:start position:0%
then the university of new hampshire
 
01:53:30.550 --> 01:53:30.560 align:start position:0%
decides throughout we're going to use
 
01:53:32.629 --> 01:53:32.639 align:start position:0%
some of that to offset the cost for for
 
01:53:34.550 --> 01:53:34.560 align:start position:0%
a student that is coming from an
 
01:53:37.030 --> 01:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
economic situation where they cannot pay
 
01:53:39.109 --> 01:53:39.119 align:start position:0%
full full freight
 
01:53:41.109 --> 01:53:41.119 align:start position:0%
okay so i see so you're saying
 
01:53:42.629 --> 01:53:42.639 align:start position:0%
basically if the money isn't going to
 
01:53:44.390 --> 01:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
the university system to pay for these
 
01:53:46.709 --> 01:53:46.719 align:start position:0%
scholarships would the students have
 
01:53:48.629 --> 01:53:48.639 align:start position:0%
it'd be state money flowing to the
 
01:53:48.639 --> 01:53:49.990 align:start position:0%
it'd be state money flowing to the
system

01:53:49.990 --> 01:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:53:52.470 --> 01:53:52.480 align:start position:0%
and the system you know uses money in a
 
01:53:53.830 --> 01:53:53.840 align:start position:0%
whole lot of different ways it's just
 
01:53:55.910 --> 01:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
one example how they may use it and i'm
 
01:53:57.990 --> 01:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
just looking at are there any possible
 
01:54:00.070 --> 01:54:00.080 align:start position:0%
results which we could end up
 
01:54:02.229 --> 01:54:02.239 align:start position:0%
in litigation as a result of following
 
01:54:05.990 --> 01:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:09.830 --> 01:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
i would assume i again i i can't
 
01:54:11.830 --> 01:54:11.840 align:start position:0%
it's a possibility but i can't think of
 
01:54:13.270 --> 01:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
a concrete example at the top of my head
 
01:54:14.950 --> 01:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
i mean there's certainly
 
01:54:17.189 --> 01:54:17.199 align:start position:0%
always the risk for litigation when when
 
01:54:19.350 --> 01:54:19.360 align:start position:0%
someone is denied funding
 
01:54:21.189 --> 01:54:21.199 align:start position:0%
um whether or not that is kind of
 
01:54:22.629 --> 01:54:22.639 align:start position:0%
successful litigation is something i
 
01:54:24.149 --> 01:54:24.159 align:start position:0%
would have to think more carefully about
 
01:54:25.510 --> 01:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
before thank you very much
 
01:54:27.910 --> 01:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
are there further questions
 
01:54:30.870 --> 01:54:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:32.390 --> 01:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
yes um
 
01:54:35.310 --> 01:54:35.320 align:start position:0%
what about the issue of competing
 
01:54:38.310 --> 01:54:38.320 align:start position:0%
disabilities if somebody really needed
 
01:54:41.030 --> 01:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
to be able to see somebody's
 
01:54:44.390 --> 01:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
facial expressions mouth etc for
 
01:54:47.830 --> 01:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
understanding etc
 
01:54:51.109 --> 01:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
would they be able to have their class
 
01:54:55.430 --> 01:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
be maskless if it was a mask mandate
 
01:54:57.030 --> 01:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
so considering that particular question
 
01:54:58.310 --> 01:54:58.320 align:start position:0%
i remember you i think you had mentioned
 
01:54:59.910 --> 01:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
it earlier or someone had mentioned kind
 
01:55:01.910 --> 01:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
of the seeing the face they do make
 
01:55:03.910 --> 01:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
masks that have kind of the clear panel
 
01:55:05.589 --> 01:55:05.599 align:start position:0%
across the person's mouth so you can
 
01:55:07.189 --> 01:55:07.199 align:start position:0%
continue to read lips my understanding
 
01:55:09.030 --> 01:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
is certain law enforcement agencies may
 
01:55:10.310 --> 01:55:10.320 align:start position:0%
use this when they're interacting with
 
01:55:12.629 --> 01:55:12.639 align:start position:0%
members of the public to enable that
 
01:55:15.990 --> 01:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
um but so there is an opportunity there
 
01:55:19.910 --> 01:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:21.669 --> 01:55:21.679 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any further
 
01:55:24.149 --> 01:55:24.159 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much and your
 
01:55:34.310 --> 01:55:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:35.830 --> 01:55:35.840 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
01:55:37.990 --> 01:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
i wasn't expected to
 
01:55:39.990 --> 01:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
speak today but since i heard everybody
 
01:55:42.310 --> 01:55:42.320 align:start position:0%
else's testimony i feel like i have
 
01:55:43.510 --> 01:55:43.520 align:start position:0%

01:55:46.070 --> 01:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
um i'm a retired recreation therapist i

01:56:15.679 --> 01:56:16.470 align:start position:0%
i'm not wearing a mask today because
i

01:56:16.470 --> 01:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:56:18.950 --> 01:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
very early on read the research and
 
01:56:20.390 --> 01:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
decided i was not going to do the
 
01:56:20.400 --> 01:56:22.070 align:start position:0%
decided i was not going to do the
vaccine

01:56:22.070 --> 01:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
01:56:25.990 --> 01:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
i used a mask during when i was working
 
01:56:27.589 --> 01:56:27.599 align:start position:0%
but when
 
01:56:27.599 --> 01:56:28.870 align:start position:0%
but when
the

01:56:28.870 --> 01:56:28.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:56:28.880 --> 01:56:30.229 align:start position:0%
the
um

01:56:30.229 --> 01:56:30.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:31.910 --> 01:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
you know two years ago in march when i
 
01:56:34.470 --> 01:56:34.480 align:start position:0%
was working at the wellness center um
 
01:56:36.709 --> 01:56:36.719 align:start position:0%
they turned us over to close the
 
01:56:37.990 --> 01:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
wellness center
 
01:56:40.870 --> 01:56:40.880 align:start position:0%
and we were told to
 
01:56:45.270 --> 01:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
um wear masks and then now be front line
 
01:56:47.669 --> 01:56:47.679 align:start position:0%
and so for five months i worked front
 
01:56:47.679 --> 01:56:48.709 align:start position:0%
and so for five months i worked front
line

01:56:48.709 --> 01:56:48.719 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:56:50.470 --> 01:56:50.480 align:start position:0%
doing check-in
 
01:56:53.750 --> 01:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
for temperatures i still didn't get sick
 
01:56:56.470 --> 01:56:56.480 align:start position:0%
i'm a big advocate of health and
 
01:56:59.430 --> 01:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
wellness and exercise and vitamins
 
01:56:59.440 --> 01:57:00.390 align:start position:0%
wellness and exercise and vitamins
um

01:57:00.390 --> 01:57:00.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:02.149 --> 01:57:02.159 align:start position:0%
and i wanted to say a little bit about
 
01:57:05.589 --> 01:57:05.599 align:start position:0%
some of my experiences um i was doing a
 
01:57:08.229 --> 01:57:08.239 align:start position:0%
pcr because my husband's a diplomat
 
01:57:10.950 --> 01:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
we're part-time down in the bahamas and
 
01:57:13.830 --> 01:57:13.840 align:start position:0%
um i had to take a pcr test to fly down
 
01:57:15.510 --> 01:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
to the bahamas
 
01:57:18.550 --> 01:57:18.560 align:start position:0%
and i had my mask on my n95 that i see
 
01:57:20.950 --> 01:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
many people wearing today
 
01:57:23.270 --> 01:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
it gives you a little bit more oxygen
 
01:57:25.910 --> 01:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
and i said i would like to test
 
01:57:28.149 --> 01:57:28.159 align:start position:0%
my oxygen level while i'm sitting here
 
01:57:29.669 --> 01:57:29.679 align:start position:0%
at resting level because that's what
 
01:57:31.189 --> 01:57:31.199 align:start position:0%
something i was doing with all my
 
01:57:33.109 --> 01:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
cardiac patients and
 
01:57:35.510 --> 01:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
in the wellness center and i knew the
 
01:57:37.030 --> 01:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
levels of
 
01:57:40.709 --> 01:57:40.719 align:start position:0%
what was somebody that was ill and
 
01:57:43.830 --> 01:57:43.840 align:start position:0%
somebody that was normal and i my oxygen
 
01:57:45.990 --> 01:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
level was usually about a 97 i'm an
 
01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:47.030 align:start position:0%
level was usually about a 97 i'm an
athlete

01:57:47.030 --> 01:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
athlete
 
01:57:51.270 --> 01:57:51.280 align:start position:0%
um to 99 when i was working out
 
01:57:54.790 --> 01:57:54.800 align:start position:0%
and it turned out to be 95
 
01:57:58.870 --> 01:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
which was the level of my cardiac oldest
 
01:58:00.790 --> 01:58:00.800 align:start position:0%
most sickest patient
 
01:58:03.030 --> 01:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
and i was like whoa
 
01:58:03.040 --> 01:58:03.990 align:start position:0%
and i was like whoa
um

01:58:03.990 --> 01:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:06.229 --> 01:58:06.239 align:start position:0%
what is happening to us in a society
 
01:58:08.310 --> 01:58:08.320 align:start position:0%
wearing these masks and what is
 
01:58:09.830 --> 01:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
happening to our
 
01:58:12.310 --> 01:58:12.320 align:start position:0%
young children and young adults wearing
 
01:58:13.830 --> 01:58:13.840 align:start position:0%
these masks
 
01:58:15.990 --> 01:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
nobody's researching this and i just
 
01:58:18.229 --> 01:58:18.239 align:start position:0%
wanted to tell you that this is my
 
01:58:18.239 --> 01:58:20.550 align:start position:0%
wanted to tell you that this is my
experience

01:58:20.550 --> 01:58:20.560 align:start position:0%
experience
 
01:58:22.709 --> 01:58:22.719 align:start position:0%
i also was i'm involved in rise up new
 
01:58:24.870 --> 01:58:24.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire very minimally
 
01:58:27.270 --> 01:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
i went to a support group
 
01:58:28.790 --> 01:58:28.800 align:start position:0%
and there were about seven or eight of
 
01:58:28.800 --> 01:58:30.790 align:start position:0%
and there were about seven or eight of
us

01:58:30.790 --> 01:58:30.800 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:58:32.790 --> 01:58:32.800 align:start position:0%
this is before i got
 
01:58:35.830 --> 01:58:35.840 align:start position:0%
covid which i did on thanksgiving
 
01:58:37.430 --> 01:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
my husband's fully vaccinated because he
 
01:58:39.189 --> 01:58:39.199 align:start position:0%
works for the state department
 
01:58:39.199 --> 01:58:40.390 align:start position:0%
works for the state department
and

01:58:40.390 --> 01:58:40.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:58:41.589 --> 01:58:41.599 align:start position:0%
he got
 
01:58:45.270 --> 01:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
omicron as well as my son
 
01:58:48.310 --> 01:58:48.320 align:start position:0%
and we were all about at the same level
 
01:58:50.870 --> 01:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
we i took ivermectin um that i had a
 
01:58:52.070 --> 01:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
little bit of
 
01:58:55.750 --> 01:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
we also took chaga tea and um
 
01:58:57.109 --> 01:58:57.119 align:start position:0%
just to have this written down for
 
01:59:00.550 --> 01:59:00.560 align:start position:0%
people to know um and wormwood which is
 
01:59:02.229 --> 01:59:02.239 align:start position:0%
also a
 
01:59:03.990 --> 01:59:04.000 align:start position:0%
antiviral there's lots of natural
 
01:59:06.390 --> 01:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
antivirals that are out there along with
 
01:59:09.270 --> 01:59:09.280 align:start position:0%
all the vitamins that i took the
 
01:59:11.430 --> 01:59:11.440 align:start position:0%
increased dc zinc
 
01:59:11.440 --> 01:59:13.990 align:start position:0%
increased dc zinc
quercetin

01:59:13.990 --> 01:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
quercetin
 
01:59:15.910 --> 01:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
so we were all about the same level my
 
01:59:17.430 --> 01:59:17.440 align:start position:0%
husband actually sicker
 
01:59:17.440 --> 01:59:18.390 align:start position:0%
husband actually sicker
um

01:59:18.390 --> 01:59:18.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:21.189 --> 01:59:21.199 align:start position:0%
than i was and um
 
01:59:23.109 --> 01:59:23.119 align:start position:0%
he has always been i've been the one
 
01:59:24.550 --> 01:59:24.560 align:start position:0%
with all the respiratory problems and
 
01:59:26.790 --> 01:59:26.800 align:start position:0%
the allergies and everything and he was
 
01:59:29.589 --> 01:59:29.599 align:start position:0%
a lot sicker than i was um
 
01:59:32.470 --> 01:59:32.480 align:start position:0%
and so i don't know what that relates to
 
01:59:34.229 --> 01:59:34.239 align:start position:0%
but it could be because he was
 
01:59:34.239 --> 01:59:35.430 align:start position:0%
but it could be because he was
vaccinated

01:59:35.430 --> 01:59:35.440 align:start position:0%
vaccinated
 
01:59:37.990 --> 01:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
um so anyways i want to go back to the
 
01:59:40.390 --> 01:59:40.400 align:start position:0%
support group um
 
01:59:42.229 --> 01:59:42.239 align:start position:0%
we were sitting around and there were
 
01:59:44.790 --> 01:59:44.800 align:start position:0%
eight of us and um
 
01:59:47.430 --> 01:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
one of them was a college nurse
 
01:59:50.950 --> 01:59:50.960 align:start position:0%
she's not here today which i'm surprised
 
01:59:53.830 --> 01:59:53.840 align:start position:0%
and she was so upset and it took the
 
01:59:53.840 --> 01:59:54.870 align:start position:0%
and she was so upset and it took the
whole

01:59:54.870 --> 01:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
whole
 
01:59:57.109 --> 01:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
session to calm her down
 
02:00:00.229 --> 02:00:00.239 align:start position:0%
because she told us that she had a stack
 
02:00:01.669 --> 02:00:01.679 align:start position:0%
about this high
 
02:00:04.070 --> 02:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
of all the college students that came in
 
02:00:04.080 --> 02:00:06.709 align:start position:0%
of all the college students that came in
from

02:00:06.709 --> 02:00:06.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:08.870 --> 02:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
their adverse reactions
 
02:00:10.550 --> 02:00:10.560 align:start position:0%
their depression
 
02:00:13.750 --> 02:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
from the vaccine from all the mandates
 
02:00:16.149 --> 02:00:16.159 align:start position:0%
and she didn't know what to do
 
02:00:18.550 --> 02:00:18.560 align:start position:0%
i told her to write it down but you know
 
02:00:19.750 --> 02:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
some people
 
02:00:22.470 --> 02:00:22.480 align:start position:0%
um just want to
 
02:00:22.480 --> 02:00:23.990 align:start position:0%
um just want to
uh

02:00:23.990 --> 02:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:00:25.750 --> 02:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
they want to keep their jobs you know so
 
02:00:29.669 --> 02:00:29.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:31.990 --> 02:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
and lastly i wanted to say i am support
 
02:00:33.430 --> 02:00:33.440 align:start position:0%
of this
 
02:00:33.440 --> 02:00:35.350 align:start position:0%
of this
bill

02:00:35.350 --> 02:00:35.360 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:00:37.109 --> 02:00:37.119 align:start position:0%
i know that a couple weeks ago i heard
 
02:00:39.750 --> 02:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
on the radio that dartmouth college was
 
02:00:43.109 --> 02:00:43.119 align:start position:0%
double vaccinated and boostered and were
 
02:00:45.510 --> 02:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
requiring masks and still
 
02:00:48.870 --> 02:00:48.880 align:start position:0%
um 700 students got sick
 
02:00:51.510 --> 02:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
so that's something to consider
 
02:00:53.030 --> 02:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
maybe also consider
 
02:00:54.709 --> 02:00:54.719 align:start position:0%
finding out from some of these college
 
02:00:54.719 --> 02:00:55.669 align:start position:0%
finding out from some of these college
nurses

02:00:55.669 --> 02:00:55.679 align:start position:0%
nurses
 
02:00:57.990 --> 02:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
um what they're seeing
 
02:00:58.000 --> 02:00:58.870 align:start position:0%
um what they're seeing
um

02:00:58.870 --> 02:00:58.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:01.750 --> 02:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
not just from me saying this but
 
02:01:04.149 --> 02:01:04.159 align:start position:0%
actually bringing in some college nurses
 
02:01:06.790 --> 02:01:06.800 align:start position:0%
and and seeing what their reactions are
 
02:01:06.800 --> 02:01:07.830 align:start position:0%
and and seeing what their reactions are
to

02:01:07.830 --> 02:01:07.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:01:10.310 --> 02:01:10.320 align:start position:0%
all these effects
 
02:01:11.990 --> 02:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
that's all i have to say thank you very
 
02:01:13.830 --> 02:01:13.840 align:start position:0%
much are there any questions from the
 
02:01:13.840 --> 02:01:15.510 align:start position:0%

go ahead with uh hb 1332
 
02:02:45.270 --> 02:02:45.280 align:start position:0%
this is a bill
 
02:02:46.950 --> 02:02:46.960 align:start position:0%
accepting public universities and
 
02:02:49.030 --> 02:02:49.040 align:start position:0%

this bill is a very small but important
 
02:03:34.950 --> 02:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
bill it does one thing in one thing only
 
02:03:38.950 --> 02:03:38.960 align:start position:0%
it takes hb 220 the medical freedom in

colon 1 and adds one further exception
 
02:03:52.870 --> 02:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
to those already listed public
 
02:03:56.229 --> 02:03:56.239 align:start position:0%
institutions of higher learning
 
02:03:57.910 --> 02:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
when this bill became before my
 
02:03:57.920 --> 02:03:59.189 align:start position:0%
when this bill became before my
committee

02:03:59.189 --> 02:03:59.199 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:04:01.589 --> 02:04:01.599 align:start position:0%
last year health human services and
 
02:04:04.149 --> 02:04:04.159 align:start position:0%
elderly affairs the committee had the
 
02:04:06.069 --> 02:04:06.079 align:start position:0%
committee and the sponsor had the wisdom
 
02:04:08.709 --> 02:04:08.719 align:start position:0%
and foresight to exempt nursing homes
 
02:04:10.950 --> 02:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
and public hospitals from what was
 
02:04:12.870 --> 02:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
essentially a ban on vaccine
 
02:04:12.880 --> 02:04:15.109 align:start position:0%
essentially a ban on vaccine
requirements

02:04:15.109 --> 02:04:15.119 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
02:04:16.790 --> 02:04:16.800 align:start position:0%
we were told that this was because of
 
02:04:19.430 --> 02:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
the congregant congregate living nature
 
02:04:21.189 --> 02:04:21.199 align:start position:0%
of those institutions
 
02:04:23.109 --> 02:04:23.119 align:start position:0%
we were told that people were housed in
 
02:04:25.830 --> 02:04:25.840 align:start position:0%
such close proximity that requiring
 
02:04:27.830 --> 02:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
vaccines by employees
 
02:04:29.669 --> 02:04:29.679 align:start position:0%
might be necessary to mitigate the
 
02:04:32.709 --> 02:04:32.719 align:start position:0%
spread of covet 19.
 
02:04:35.109 --> 02:04:35.119 align:start position:0%
my bill proposes accepting colleges and
 
02:04:37.030 --> 02:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
universities as well
 
02:04:39.189 --> 02:04:39.199 align:start position:0%
dormitory living is also congregate
 
02:04:39.199 --> 02:04:40.310 align:start position:0%
dormitory living is also congregate
living

02:04:40.310 --> 02:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
living
 
02:04:42.550 --> 02:04:42.560 align:start position:0%
people share small bedrooms
 
02:04:45.430 --> 02:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
use the same bathrooms and congregate
 
02:04:47.750 --> 02:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
congregate in common living spaces and
 
02:04:47.760 --> 02:04:50.149 align:start position:0%
congregate in common living spaces and
classrooms

02:04:50.149 --> 02:04:50.159 align:start position:0%
classrooms
 
02:04:52.390 --> 02:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
this bill will not require
 
02:04:55.350 --> 02:04:55.360 align:start position:0%
covid 19 vaccinations
 
02:04:57.350 --> 02:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
it will merely leave it as an option
 
02:04:59.270 --> 02:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
should administrators
 
02:05:01.270 --> 02:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
at colleges and universities with the
 
02:05:02.790 --> 02:05:02.800 align:start position:0%
consultation of public health
 
02:05:05.270 --> 02:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
professionals decide that it is the best
 
02:05:07.669 --> 02:05:07.679 align:start position:0%
way to keep their school open with
 
02:05:10.149 --> 02:05:10.159 align:start position:0%
in-person classes while protecting the
 
02:05:14.069 --> 02:05:14.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:16.149 --> 02:05:16.159 align:start position:0%
keene state college as you know is a new
 
02:05:17.990 --> 02:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire public college
 
02:05:20.470 --> 02:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
there is no vaccine mandate for students
 
02:05:22.550 --> 02:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
faculty or staff
 
02:05:24.069 --> 02:05:24.079 align:start position:0%
they have done an excellent job at
 
02:05:26.709 --> 02:05:26.719 align:start position:0%
preventing overwhelming spread of covid
 
02:05:28.790 --> 02:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
they have regular testing
 
02:05:31.270 --> 02:05:31.280 align:start position:0%
masking and they have pioneered the use
 
02:05:33.750 --> 02:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
of wastewater testing to gauge increases
 
02:05:38.390 --> 02:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
in spread to to inform their policies
 
02:05:40.229 --> 02:05:40.239 align:start position:0%
they have a rapid response team that
 
02:05:42.629 --> 02:05:42.639 align:start position:0%
does intensive and timely contract
 
02:05:44.550 --> 02:05:44.560 align:start position:0%
contact tracing
 
02:05:46.149 --> 02:05:46.159 align:start position:0%
as we've heard from one of the speakers
 
02:05:51.910 --> 02:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:53.910 --> 02:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
and students who are unvaccinated must
 
02:05:55.830 --> 02:05:55.840 align:start position:0%
immediately quarantine if they've been
 
02:05:55.840 --> 02:05:57.910 align:start position:0%
immediately quarantine if they've been
exposed

02:05:57.910 --> 02:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
exposed
 
02:05:59.669 --> 02:05:59.679 align:start position:0%
they have stayed open and students have
 
02:06:01.589 --> 02:06:01.599 align:start position:0%
been able to have a somewhat normal
 
02:06:03.910 --> 02:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
college experience
 
02:06:06.229 --> 02:06:06.239 align:start position:0%
also in cheshire county is franklin
 
02:06:08.229 --> 02:06:08.239 align:start position:0%
pierce college which does
 
02:06:10.790 --> 02:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
does have a vaccine mandate
 
02:06:12.709 --> 02:06:12.719 align:start position:0%
i am not a scientist nor am i a
 
02:06:12.719 --> 02:06:14.069 align:start position:0%
i am not a scientist nor am i a
statistician

02:06:14.069 --> 02:06:14.079 align:start position:0%
statistician
 
02:06:16.470 --> 02:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
i know there are many variables
 
02:06:18.390 --> 02:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
still both colleges have a cova
 
02:06:20.550 --> 02:06:20.560 align:start position:0%
dashboard and i took a look
 
02:06:23.589 --> 02:06:23.599 align:start position:0%
it's just one point in time but franklin
 
02:06:27.510 --> 02:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
pierce had 2.2 active cases for 1 000
 
02:06:27.520 --> 02:06:28.709 align:start position:0%
pierce had 2.2 active cases for 1 000
students

02:06:28.709 --> 02:06:28.719 align:start position:0%
students
 
02:06:32.149 --> 02:06:32.159 align:start position:0%
while keene state college had 26.6
 
02:06:34.149 --> 02:06:34.159 align:start position:0%
active cases per thousand students and
 
02:06:36.709 --> 02:06:36.719 align:start position:0%
that was just
 
02:06:39.510 --> 02:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
last week of january
 
02:06:41.350 --> 02:06:41.360 align:start position:0%
once again this is a small bill that
 
02:06:44.629 --> 02:06:44.639 align:start position:0%
makes a small change it mandates nothing
 
02:06:46.790 --> 02:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
rather it allows school administrators
 
02:06:49.030 --> 02:06:49.040 align:start position:0%
the option of using vaccine requirements
 
02:06:50.709 --> 02:06:50.719 align:start position:0%
in the future should a more lethal
 
02:06:53.830 --> 02:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
variant of covid19 come along or should
 
02:06:55.510 --> 02:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
there be a new and different deadly
 
02:06:57.350 --> 02:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
communicable illness in the next few
 
02:06:57.360 --> 02:06:59.189 align:start position:0%
communicable illness in the next few
years

02:06:59.189 --> 02:06:59.199 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:07:01.430 --> 02:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
if you were an administrator
 
02:07:03.430 --> 02:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
or the parent of a college student or a
 
02:07:05.669 --> 02:07:05.679 align:start position:0%
college student yourself wouldn't you
 
02:07:08.950 --> 02:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:10.550 --> 02:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
and that is the end of my
 
02:07:12.390 --> 02:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
testimony i hope that you will consider
 
02:07:14.310 --> 02:07:14.320 align:start position:0%
this bill and um

what was just said
 
02:07:57.750 --> 02:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
college systems are congregal living we
 
02:07:59.270 --> 02:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
feel that they belong in the same
 
02:08:01.990 --> 02:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
exemption category as our
 
02:08:04.390 --> 02:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
long-term care facilities in our new
 
02:08:06.790 --> 02:08:06.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital system the rest of my
 
02:08:08.310 --> 02:08:08.320 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
02:08:32.069 --> 02:08:32.079 align:start position:0%
good morning again mr chairman uh
 
02:08:33.189 --> 02:08:33.199 align:start position:0%
members of the committee tom cronin
 
02:08:34.629 --> 02:08:34.639 align:start position:0%
director of government relations for the
 
02:08:37.270 --> 02:08:37.280 align:start position:0%
university system uh
 
02:08:38.629 --> 02:08:38.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for having us here on house
 
02:08:40.790 --> 02:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
bill 1332 we are in support of this
 
02:08:43.589 --> 02:08:43.599 align:start position:0%
legislation really for two key reasons
 
02:08:43.599 --> 02:08:44.470 align:start position:0%
legislation really for two key reasons
um

02:08:44.470 --> 02:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:46.550 --> 02:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
first as has been mentioned
 
02:08:48.550 --> 02:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
the proposal recognizes the importance
 
02:08:51.270 --> 02:08:51.280 align:start position:0%
of treating residential college campuses
 
02:08:53.109 --> 02:08:53.119 align:start position:0%
differently on matters of public health
 
02:08:55.109 --> 02:08:55.119 align:start position:0%
than other public facilities
 
02:08:56.550 --> 02:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
for a little bit of scale we have
 
02:08:59.189 --> 02:08:59.199 align:start position:0%
approximately 10 000 students who live
 
02:09:01.669 --> 02:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
on our campuses during the academic year
 
02:09:04.470 --> 02:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
and another 18 000 or so who live off
 
02:09:07.030 --> 02:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
campus but in close proximity and then
 
02:09:08.390 --> 02:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
come to campus
 
02:09:11.589 --> 02:09:11.599 align:start position:0%
to learn socialize with our residential
 
02:09:11.599 --> 02:09:12.470 align:start position:0%
to learn socialize with our residential
students

02:09:12.470 --> 02:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
students
 
02:09:14.069 --> 02:09:14.079 align:start position:0%
conditions on a residential campus
 
02:09:15.910 --> 02:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
include as mentioned congregate living
 
02:09:17.910 --> 02:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
dining studying athletics events and
 
02:09:19.830 --> 02:09:19.840 align:start position:0%
other social opportunities
 
02:09:21.990 --> 02:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
they require special protocols and extra
 
02:09:23.589 --> 02:09:23.599 align:start position:0%
vigilance to protect health and the
 
02:09:25.669 --> 02:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
well-being of campus
 
02:09:25.679 --> 02:09:27.430 align:start position:0%
well-being of campus
second

02:09:27.430 --> 02:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
second
 
02:09:29.990 --> 02:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
as you all well know rsa 187a grants
 
02:09:32.229 --> 02:09:32.239 align:start position:0%
broad authority to the usnh board of
 
02:09:34.229 --> 02:09:34.239 align:start position:0%
trustees to manage the property and
 
02:09:36.550 --> 02:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
affairs of the university system to our
 
02:09:38.870 --> 02:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
mind the continued success of usnh and
 
02:09:41.510 --> 02:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
our institution depends in large measure
 
02:09:43.430 --> 02:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
measure on our bot having the
 
02:09:45.430 --> 02:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
flexibility to address constantly
 
02:09:47.990 --> 02:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
evolving health and safety conditions
 
02:09:50.069 --> 02:09:50.079 align:start position:0%
as testified to in the last hearing we
 
02:09:51.430 --> 02:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
do not have a vaccination mandate at
 
02:09:53.030 --> 02:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
this time there's no conversation at
 
02:09:54.870 --> 02:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
this time to have a vaccine mandate i
 
02:09:56.310 --> 02:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
think we can all agree however that
 
02:09:58.870 --> 02:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
nobody knows what is next be it kovid be
 
02:10:01.669 --> 02:10:01.679 align:start position:0%
it anything else and a law that is
 
02:10:03.910 --> 02:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
currently in place um through 220 last
 
02:10:05.430 --> 02:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
year that
 
02:10:08.069 --> 02:10:08.079 align:start position:0%
to our reading prohibits our ability
 
02:10:10.550 --> 02:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
to have a mandate on students
 
02:10:13.830 --> 02:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
in the event of some sort of an outbreak
 
02:10:15.669 --> 02:10:15.679 align:start position:0%
on a variant we haven't seen yet is
 
02:10:15.679 --> 02:10:17.109 align:start position:0%
on a variant we haven't seen yet is
simply

02:10:17.109 --> 02:10:17.119 align:start position:0%
simply
 
02:10:18.550 --> 02:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
preventing the flexibility that we spoke
 
02:10:20.709 --> 02:10:20.719 align:start position:0%
to in the last hearing so really for us
 
02:10:22.709 --> 02:10:22.719 align:start position:0%
this bill improves the existing
 
02:10:24.390 --> 02:10:24.400 align:start position:0%
flexibility we have to try and manage
 
02:10:26.069 --> 02:10:26.079 align:start position:0%
the health and safety of our campus
 
02:10:27.589 --> 02:10:27.599 align:start position:0%
along with all of the other health
 
02:10:29.030 --> 02:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
health measures we spoke about in the
 
02:10:31.510 --> 02:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
last hearing uh
 
02:10:32.790 --> 02:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
yeah so i'll conclude there and be happy
 
02:10:33.750 --> 02:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
to take a question thank you very much
 
02:10:38.629 --> 02:10:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:41.270 --> 02:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
if this law had not been in place would
 
02:10:44.310 --> 02:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
you have required vaccines thank you for
 
02:10:47.189 --> 02:10:47.199 align:start position:0%
the question so it's hard to
 
02:10:49.350 --> 02:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
you know that's obviously hypothetical i
 
02:10:51.030 --> 02:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
can say there were conversations um
 
02:10:53.189 --> 02:10:53.199 align:start position:0%
throughout last year as the vaccine came
 
02:10:56.069 --> 02:10:56.079 align:start position:0%
online it was out in the public um it
 
02:10:59.350 --> 02:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
was clear we are a public institution um
 
02:11:02.390 --> 02:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
who has a degree of uh responsibility to
 
02:11:04.550 --> 02:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
understand how you all as lawmakers feel
 
02:11:06.709 --> 02:11:06.719 align:start position:0%
on these issues and it was obvious to us
 
02:11:08.709 --> 02:11:08.719 align:start position:0%
from the conversations uh occurring last
 
02:11:11.030 --> 02:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
year that it wasn't something that the
 
02:11:12.470 --> 02:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
legislature would have been supportive
 
02:11:13.750 --> 02:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
of so that certainly played into our
 
02:11:15.910 --> 02:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
decision so again i can't say for sure
 
02:11:17.910 --> 02:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
if 220 never happened and these
 
02:11:19.510 --> 02:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
conversations never happened exactly
 
02:11:22.069 --> 02:11:22.079 align:start position:0%
where we would be today um but i can say
 
02:11:24.629 --> 02:11:24.639 align:start position:0%
we certainly took that as a suggestion
 
02:11:26.870 --> 02:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
um and we also i think had some
 
02:11:29.350 --> 02:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
confidence in our our student body in
 
02:11:31.589 --> 02:11:31.599 align:start position:0%
our faculty and staff that they would
 
02:11:34.550 --> 02:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
come together voluntarily um to try and
 
02:11:36.950 --> 02:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
take steps to to protect each other um
 
02:11:39.189 --> 02:11:39.199 align:start position:0%
as a follow-up on a question from the
 
02:11:42.629 --> 02:11:42.639 align:start position:0%
last conversation um we have at unh and
 
02:11:43.990 --> 02:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
at plymouth i believe we're about 80
 
02:11:45.589 --> 02:11:45.599 align:start position:0%
percent of our students
 
02:11:47.430 --> 02:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
are vaccinated uh keen i think they've
 
02:11:49.350 --> 02:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
reported about 74
 
02:11:51.030 --> 02:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
and again those are voluntarily reported
 
02:11:54.229 --> 02:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
vaccination numbers so we ask uh folks
 
02:11:55.589 --> 02:11:55.599 align:start position:0%
to let us know one way or another it
 
02:11:57.350 --> 02:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
helps us sort of gauge how things are
 
02:11:58.950 --> 02:11:58.960 align:start position:0%
going on campus so they could
 
02:12:01.270 --> 02:12:01.280 align:start position:0%
potentially be higher um but that's sort
 
02:12:02.550 --> 02:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
of the number we have so
 
02:12:04.470 --> 02:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
largely we did fall back on knowing we
 
02:12:06.069 --> 02:12:06.079 align:start position:0%
could trust our community to try to come
 
02:12:08.149 --> 02:12:08.159 align:start position:0%
together and do this voluntarily thank
 
02:12:08.159 --> 02:12:08.870 align:start position:0%
together and do this voluntarily thank
you

02:12:08.870 --> 02:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:12:08.880 --> 02:12:10.310 align:start position:0%
you
representative

02:12:10.310 --> 02:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:12:11.589 --> 02:12:11.599 align:start position:0%
thank you monsieur thank you miss corn
 
02:12:13.350 --> 02:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
for being here again
 
02:12:15.270 --> 02:12:15.280 align:start position:0%
exchange students come to new hampshire
 
02:12:17.510 --> 02:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
from a variety of other countries with
 
02:12:19.830 --> 02:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
different cultures backgrounds and
 
02:12:21.430 --> 02:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
medical practices
 
02:12:23.830 --> 02:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
so if this were to become law and if a
 
02:12:27.830 --> 02:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
vax mandate came about on on
 
02:12:30.550 --> 02:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
public campuses would exchange students
 
02:12:32.310 --> 02:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
be exempted depending on their
 
02:12:34.149 --> 02:12:34.159 align:start position:0%
backgrounds or they would exchange
 
02:12:37.350 --> 02:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
students be mandated to get shots
 
02:12:37.360 --> 02:12:38.550 align:start position:0%
students be mandated to get shots
uh

02:12:38.550 --> 02:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:12:38.560 --> 02:12:39.750 align:start position:0%
uh
i'm

02:12:39.750 --> 02:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
02:12:41.589 --> 02:12:41.599 align:start position:0%
assuming that
 
02:12:43.030 --> 02:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
they would fall under the same rules as
 
02:12:44.149 --> 02:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
every other student the same way they
 
02:12:45.350 --> 02:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
currently do
 
02:12:46.550 --> 02:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
as i think folks are aware the
 
02:12:48.310 --> 02:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
university system has a series of
 
02:12:50.310 --> 02:12:50.320 align:start position:0%
required vaccinations already
 
02:12:52.069 --> 02:12:52.079 align:start position:0%
and exchange students have to have to do
 
02:12:53.510 --> 02:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
those as well
 
02:12:55.750 --> 02:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:12:58.629 --> 02:12:58.639 align:start position:0%
further questions representative tanner
 
02:13:00.709 --> 02:13:00.719 align:start position:0%

02:13:02.790 --> 02:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:13:05.350 --> 02:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
are international students subject to
 
02:13:07.830 --> 02:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
vaccination requirements by the united
 
02:13:09.910 --> 02:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
states government to actually come to
 
02:13:11.990 --> 02:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
the united states to participate at a
 
02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.310 align:start position:0%
the united states to participate at a
college

02:13:14.310 --> 02:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
college
 
02:13:20.390 --> 02:13:20.400 align:start position:0%

nelson
 
02:13:25.350 --> 02:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
02:13:26.790 --> 02:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:13:29.589 --> 02:13:29.599 align:start position:0%
are there any exemptions for uh specific
 
02:13:31.350 --> 02:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
religious reasons
 
02:13:32.310 --> 02:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:13:36.629 --> 02:13:36.639 align:start position:0%
yes um we have a uh both religious uh
 
02:13:38.629 --> 02:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
and medical exemptions for so we're
 
02:13:41.990 --> 02:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
talking about our existing uh
 
02:13:43.589 --> 02:13:43.599 align:start position:0%
vaccination requirements we do have
 
02:13:46.069 --> 02:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
those and they are easily understood and
 
02:13:46.079 --> 02:13:48.069 align:start position:0%
those and they are easily understood and
accessible

02:13:48.069 --> 02:13:48.079 align:start position:0%
accessible
 
02:13:49.510 --> 02:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
and again it's maybe just a follow-up
 
02:13:51.910 --> 02:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
representative tanner's question
 
02:13:54.149 --> 02:13:54.159 align:start position:0%
again we have required vaccinations on
 
02:13:56.310 --> 02:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
campus a student coming from anywhere to
 
02:13:58.310 --> 02:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
live on campus would need to either meet
 
02:14:00.390 --> 02:14:00.400 align:start position:0%
those requirements or take advantage of
 
02:14:02.390 --> 02:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
existing religious or medical exemptions
 
02:14:04.069 --> 02:14:04.079 align:start position:0%
so i can't say for sure exactly what the
 
02:14:06.229 --> 02:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
nation on a whole provides but to come
 
02:14:09.109 --> 02:14:09.119 align:start position:0%
study on our campuses
 
02:14:14.310 --> 02:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:16.550 --> 02:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
were to pass or not passed how is that
 
02:14:18.310 --> 02:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
going to impact
 
02:14:18.320 --> 02:14:19.109 align:start position:0%
going to impact
the

02:14:19.109 --> 02:14:19.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:14:22.069 --> 02:14:22.079 align:start position:0%
situation we experienced oh at the end
 
02:14:24.709 --> 02:14:24.719 align:start position:0%
of last year when we had the nasa grant
 
02:14:27.350 --> 02:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
nosha now that's all been reversed right
 
02:14:30.550 --> 02:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
now however by mandating the vaccination
 
02:14:33.589 --> 02:14:33.599 align:start position:0%
of contractors we've lost well over 100
 
02:14:35.109 --> 02:14:35.119 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
02:14:37.109 --> 02:14:37.119 align:start position:0%
in in grant funding
 
02:14:40.310 --> 02:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
if we have this in place for for example
 
02:14:42.709 --> 02:14:42.719 align:start position:0%
we are now re if we required
 
02:14:42.719 --> 02:14:44.310 align:start position:0%
we are now re if we required
vaccinations

02:14:44.310 --> 02:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
vaccinations
 
02:14:47.189 --> 02:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
and then you have an or didn't require
 
02:14:49.189 --> 02:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
vaccinations i'll take it didn't require
 
02:14:52.149 --> 02:14:52.159 align:start position:0%
the vaccination and we had something
 
02:14:54.149 --> 02:14:54.159 align:start position:0%
potentially come down
 
02:14:56.229 --> 02:14:56.239 align:start position:0%
with loss of grant money
 
02:14:58.950 --> 02:14:58.960 align:start position:0%
is that potent potentially an issue that
 
02:15:01.830 --> 02:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
you are considering or looking at
 
02:15:03.189 --> 02:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question mr chairman
 
02:15:05.189 --> 02:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
um so i think a couple points to that
 
02:15:07.669 --> 02:15:07.679 align:start position:0%
first the the nasa requirement and the
 
02:15:09.830 --> 02:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
federal requirement last year was
 
02:15:14.149 --> 02:15:14.159 align:start position:0%
specific to covered employees uh we view
 
02:15:14.159 --> 02:15:15.109 align:start position:0%
specific to covered employees uh we view
the

02:15:15.109 --> 02:15:15.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:15:16.229 --> 02:15:16.239 align:start position:0%
existing medical freedom and
 
02:15:19.589 --> 02:15:19.599 align:start position:0%
immunization law 141c colon one as
 
02:15:22.390 --> 02:15:22.400 align:start position:0%
applying to students so other than a
 
02:15:23.990 --> 02:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
small section of students who are also
 
02:15:26.470 --> 02:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
employees we don't feel as though those
 
02:15:28.390 --> 02:15:28.400 align:start position:0%
were necessarily in conflict we
 
02:15:29.990 --> 02:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
understand there were some folks that
 
02:15:32.390 --> 02:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
disagreed with that interpretation
 
02:15:34.629 --> 02:15:34.639 align:start position:0%
and there are i believe pieces of
 
02:15:36.550 --> 02:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
legislation moving in other committees
 
02:15:39.430 --> 02:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
that would amend 141c to perhaps more
 
02:15:41.669 --> 02:15:41.679 align:start position:0%
clearly define it as including public
 
02:15:41.679 --> 02:15:43.109 align:start position:0%
clearly define it as including public
employment

02:15:43.109 --> 02:15:43.119 align:start position:0%
employment
 
02:15:45.589 --> 02:15:45.599 align:start position:0%
in that case we would be concerned that
 
02:15:48.229 --> 02:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
right state law and a federal mandate
 
02:15:50.870 --> 02:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
would conflict um on those bills in
 
02:15:53.270 --> 02:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
particular we have submitted testimony
 
02:15:55.270 --> 02:15:55.280 align:start position:0%
just to clearly state that the way the
 
02:15:58.229 --> 02:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
federal guidance on that mandate um came
 
02:16:00.550 --> 02:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
down was very clear that it was a duly
 
02:16:02.950 --> 02:16:02.960 align:start position:0%
enacted federal uh requirement and that
 
02:16:05.430 --> 02:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
it superseded any conflicting state or
 
02:16:08.229 --> 02:16:08.239 align:start position:0%
local regulations to the contrary so we
 
02:16:09.510 --> 02:16:09.520 align:start position:0%
obviously don't want to be in a place
 
02:16:10.950 --> 02:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
where we feel like we're in conflict
 
02:16:12.790 --> 02:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
well that that answers my
 
02:16:14.229 --> 02:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
my question i was worried about the
 
02:16:16.950 --> 02:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
student that's considered the contractor
 
02:16:19.510 --> 02:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
right so in though again in those cases
 
02:16:20.390 --> 02:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
they were
 
02:16:21.990 --> 02:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
somewhat few
 
02:16:23.430 --> 02:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
but we did let students know in that
 
02:16:25.270 --> 02:16:25.280 align:start position:0%
case that if they did continue to want
 
02:16:27.669 --> 02:16:27.679 align:start position:0%
to be an employee of the university they
 
02:16:29.350 --> 02:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
would need to comply by the same rules
 
02:16:31.830 --> 02:16:31.840 align:start position:0%
as other covered contractors if however
 
02:16:34.230 --> 02:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
if they chose to no longer uh
 
02:16:36.070 --> 02:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
participate in whatever in a lot of
 
02:16:37.429 --> 02:16:37.439 align:start position:0%
cases work study they were currently
 
02:16:39.110 --> 02:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
doing then there'd be no further
 
02:16:41.750 --> 02:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
consequence uh in that regard thank you
 
02:16:43.990 --> 02:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
further questions represent luno thank
 
02:16:46.150 --> 02:16:46.160 align:start position:0%
you very much mr chair thank you again
 
02:16:49.110 --> 02:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
mr cronin um earlier this morning we
 
02:16:51.349 --> 02:16:51.359 align:start position:0%
heard from one of your students um mr
 
02:16:54.230 --> 02:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
howard who uh who spoke in support of
 
02:16:55.589 --> 02:16:55.599 align:start position:0%
current um
 
02:16:57.910 --> 02:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
uh university system practices and i was
 
02:17:00.389 --> 02:17:00.399 align:start position:0%
wondering do um have you what have you
 
02:17:04.549 --> 02:17:04.559 align:start position:0%
received as far as um you know a
 
02:17:06.389 --> 02:17:06.399 align:start position:0%
truckload of complaints
 
02:17:09.030 --> 02:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
uh against your um your current prac
 
02:17:11.910 --> 02:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
your your current practice or um
 
02:17:13.509 --> 02:17:13.519 align:start position:0%
for um
 
02:17:15.990 --> 02:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
required vaccination
 
02:17:17.910 --> 02:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
thank you so again we do not have a
 
02:17:20.070 --> 02:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
current vaccine requirement on related
 
02:17:22.870 --> 02:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
to covid we do have a series of
 
02:17:25.110 --> 02:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
vaccinations required for other
 
02:17:27.750 --> 02:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
communicable diseases and certainly we
 
02:17:30.070 --> 02:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
do each year uh have a student or two
 
02:17:33.270 --> 02:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
who objects um who for any some some
 
02:17:35.190 --> 02:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
reason does not fit into either the
 
02:17:37.429 --> 02:17:37.439 align:start position:0%
medical or religious uh
 
02:17:39.030 --> 02:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
exemption and we try to work with those
 
02:17:40.469 --> 02:17:40.479 align:start position:0%
students help them understand why we
 
02:17:42.389 --> 02:17:42.399 align:start position:0%
believe they're important but it's
 
02:17:43.990 --> 02:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
certainly not a
 
02:17:46.629 --> 02:17:46.639 align:start position:0%
widespread concern about those if that
 
02:17:49.270 --> 02:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
answers your question
 
02:17:51.990 --> 02:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh any other
 
02:17:53.110 --> 02:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee yes
 
02:17:53.120 --> 02:17:55.349 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee yes
representatives

02:17:55.349 --> 02:17:55.359 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
02:17:57.509 --> 02:17:57.519 align:start position:0%
do you have i i know you said you had
 
02:17:59.429 --> 02:17:59.439 align:start position:0%
medical exemptions for
 
02:18:01.509 --> 02:18:01.519 align:start position:0%
vaccines which is great do you have a
 
02:18:04.309 --> 02:18:04.319 align:start position:0%
medical exemption for masks for people
 
02:18:06.309 --> 02:18:06.319 align:start position:0%
who do have breathing issues and their
 
02:18:08.629 --> 02:18:08.639 align:start position:0%
o2 does drop dramatically so my
 
02:18:10.870 --> 02:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
understanding is we do have i think a
 
02:18:12.709 --> 02:18:12.719 align:start position:0%
prior speaker mentioned
 
02:18:14.150 --> 02:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
either the clear face shields or other
 
02:18:15.910 --> 02:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
so i think we would work i know we will
 
02:18:17.589 --> 02:18:17.599 align:start position:0%
work with students who if they have a
 
02:18:19.830 --> 02:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
medical reason that they uh
 
02:18:21.110 --> 02:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
feel they'd be compromised by wearing a
 
02:18:22.790 --> 02:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
mask for a long period of time either we
 
02:18:24.070 --> 02:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
work with them to try and provide the
 
02:18:26.709 --> 02:18:26.719 align:start position:0%
opportunity to continue to intend in
 
02:18:29.429 --> 02:18:29.439 align:start position:0%
person but of course every
 
02:18:31.110 --> 02:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
should be careful on every
 
02:18:33.429 --> 02:18:33.439 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of our
 
02:18:35.030 --> 02:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
opportunities for education also could
 
02:18:35.040 --> 02:18:36.309 align:start position:0%
opportunities for education also could
be

02:18:36.309 --> 02:18:36.319 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:18:37.990 --> 02:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
achieved online for students who for
 
02:18:39.349 --> 02:18:39.359 align:start position:0%
whatever reason don't feel comfortable
 
02:18:42.070 --> 02:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
going into a classroom um and have
 
02:18:42.080 --> 02:18:42.950 align:start position:0%
going into a classroom um and have
some

02:18:42.950 --> 02:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
some
 
02:18:45.509 --> 02:18:45.519 align:start position:0%
medical uh issue we can't help them to
 
02:18:47.190 --> 02:18:47.200 align:start position:0%
accommodate but i know we do try to make
 
02:18:48.150 --> 02:18:48.160 align:start position:0%
sure that if they want to be in the
 
02:18:49.429 --> 02:18:49.439 align:start position:0%
classroom we're going to do what we can
 
02:18:51.270 --> 02:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
to ensure that can happen thank you
 
02:18:53.110 --> 02:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
02:18:54.709 --> 02:18:54.719 align:start position:0%
now saying thank you very much thank you
 
02:19:07.110 --> 02:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:12.389 --> 02:19:12.399 align:start position:0%
kathleen cintavi dover new hampshire
 
02:19:15.589 --> 02:19:15.599 align:start position:0%
i first want to make abundantly clear
 
02:19:17.669 --> 02:19:17.679 align:start position:0%
that college campus
 
02:19:20.549 --> 02:19:20.559 align:start position:0%
is not like a rest home
 
02:19:23.750 --> 02:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
which was previously stated
 
02:19:25.669 --> 02:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
i have worked
 
02:19:28.150 --> 02:19:28.160 align:start position:0%
in a rest home
 
02:19:32.549 --> 02:19:32.559 align:start position:0%
with autistic people and so forth
 
02:19:35.509 --> 02:19:35.519 align:start position:0%
people in a rest home very often have
 
02:19:38.469 --> 02:19:38.479 align:start position:0%
compromised immune systems have heart
 
02:19:42.389 --> 02:19:42.399 align:start position:0%
ailments or other end of life ailments
 
02:19:45.190 --> 02:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
that put them at much higher risk
 
02:19:45.200 --> 02:19:46.870 align:start position:0%
that put them at much higher risk
for

02:19:46.870 --> 02:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:19:50.150 --> 02:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
diseases that we either have now or
 
02:19:53.830 --> 02:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
coming down the pike in the future that
 
02:19:57.030 --> 02:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
could have dire outcomes and if we look
 
02:20:00.389 --> 02:20:00.399 align:start position:0%
at the difference in
 
02:20:03.349 --> 02:20:03.359 align:start position:0%
the dire outcome rate for college age
 
02:20:05.590 --> 02:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
students versus rest home students there
 
02:20:09.670 --> 02:20:09.680 align:start position:0%
really is no comparison
 
02:20:11.670 --> 02:20:11.680 align:start position:0%
college age students are young and
 
02:20:11.680 --> 02:20:13.349 align:start position:0%
college age students are young and
healthy

02:20:13.349 --> 02:20:13.359 align:start position:0%
healthy
 
02:20:16.550 --> 02:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
but one of the biggest lessons that i
 
02:20:18.790 --> 02:20:18.800 align:start position:0%
believe they need to learn during their
 
02:20:21.830 --> 02:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
college years is to practice their
 
02:20:24.230 --> 02:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
rights and responsibilities
 
02:20:27.349 --> 02:20:27.359 align:start position:0%
and to do this by doing research so if
 
02:20:31.110 --> 02:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
some future illness comes down the pike
 
02:20:31.120 --> 02:20:32.790 align:start position:0%
some future illness comes down the pike
certainly

02:20:32.790 --> 02:20:32.800 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
02:20:35.910 --> 02:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
such as we have now there is a plethora
 
02:20:39.349 --> 02:20:39.359 align:start position:0%
of information that becomes available
 
02:20:41.750 --> 02:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
and i believe that this bill
 
02:20:44.469 --> 02:20:44.479 align:start position:0%
takes away the right of individual
 
02:20:47.830 --> 02:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
students to learn to
 
02:20:50.550 --> 02:20:50.560 align:start position:0%
use their rights responsibilities
 
02:20:53.910 --> 02:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
and to make a critical
 
02:20:56.150 --> 02:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
use of critical thinking to make the
 
02:20:59.670 --> 02:20:59.680 align:start position:0%
best decision for themselves
 
02:21:02.469 --> 02:21:02.479 align:start position:0%
this is a hypothetical bill that in my
 
02:21:05.590 --> 02:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
opinion limits the freedom of health and
 
02:21:08.309 --> 02:21:08.319 align:start position:0%
wellness decisions for an age group who
 
02:21:13.110 --> 02:21:13.120 align:start position:0%
really needs to learn how to do exactly
 
02:21:16.309 --> 02:21:16.319 align:start position:0%
that to make critical decisions for
 
02:21:18.870 --> 02:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
themselves so when i look at it and
 
02:21:22.630 --> 02:21:22.640 align:start position:0%
listen to the fact that 80 of students
 
02:21:23.990 --> 02:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
at unh
 
02:21:28.469 --> 02:21:28.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:31.270 --> 02:21:31.280 align:start position:0%
what's to say that
 
02:21:33.190 --> 02:21:33.200 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't do something like that
 
02:21:36.150 --> 02:21:36.160 align:start position:0%
with the future illness so i am not in
 
02:21:38.630 --> 02:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
support of this bill because it does
 
02:21:41.830 --> 02:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
limit the rights responsibilities and
 
02:21:44.950 --> 02:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
freedoms of our youth who are the future
 
02:21:48.309 --> 02:21:48.319 align:start position:0%
of our state and our country
 
02:21:51.030 --> 02:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you any questions
 
02:21:52.550 --> 02:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
02:21:54.469 --> 02:21:54.479 align:start position:0%
yes representative woodcock thank you
 
02:21:54.479 --> 02:21:55.510 align:start position:0%
yes representative woodcock thank you
chairman

02:21:55.510 --> 02:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
02:21:58.309 --> 02:21:58.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um
 
02:22:01.030 --> 02:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
i understand your comparison between the
 
02:22:02.710 --> 02:22:02.720 align:start position:0%
nursing home situation and the college
 
02:22:02.720 --> 02:22:03.830 align:start position:0%
nursing home situation and the college
campus

02:22:03.830 --> 02:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
campus
 
02:22:06.389 --> 02:22:06.399 align:start position:0%
would you agree however that the
 
02:22:08.630 --> 02:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
college universities does have
 
02:22:11.349 --> 02:22:11.359 align:start position:0%
congregate housing and therefore has an
 
02:22:12.790 --> 02:22:12.800 align:start position:0%
option to provide
 
02:22:15.750 --> 02:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
uh reasonable accommodations absolutely
 
02:22:17.429 --> 02:22:17.439 align:start position:0%
and and
 
02:22:18.550 --> 02:22:18.560 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
02:22:21.830 --> 02:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you further questions
 
02:22:23.830 --> 02:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
seeing you thank you very much
 
02:22:29.990 --> 02:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:32.870 --> 02:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for having me again uh so i am
 
02:22:35.750 --> 02:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
here to speak in support of this bill
 
02:22:37.830 --> 02:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
of course as you know
 
02:22:39.510 --> 02:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
growing up i
 
02:22:41.670 --> 02:22:41.680 align:start position:0%
had gotten my vaccinations to go to
 
02:22:43.990 --> 02:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
elementary school and just like every
 
02:22:45.190 --> 02:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
other student
 
02:22:46.630 --> 02:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
and of course you know those
 
02:22:49.830 --> 02:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
vaccinations have had to be updated over
 
02:22:51.830 --> 02:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
the course of my life in order to be
 
02:22:53.270 --> 02:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
able to attend the university system
 
02:22:55.030 --> 02:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire
 
02:22:57.590 --> 02:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
and i don't see why a kova 19
 
02:22:57.600 --> 02:22:59.590 align:start position:0%
and i don't see why a kova 19
vaccination

02:22:59.590 --> 02:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
vaccination
 
02:23:01.990 --> 02:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
would be any different of course they've
 
02:23:04.630 --> 02:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
just gotten fda approval they've been
 
02:23:06.230 --> 02:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
proven to be safe
 
02:23:08.230 --> 02:23:08.240 align:start position:0%
they've been proven to be effective
 
02:23:10.070 --> 02:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
and we need to make sure that we can
 
02:23:12.550 --> 02:23:12.560 align:start position:0%
protect the staff faculty and students
 
02:23:14.230 --> 02:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
that go through our higher education
 
02:23:14.240 --> 02:23:15.190 align:start position:0%
that go through our higher education
system

02:23:15.190 --> 02:23:15.200 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:23:17.750 --> 02:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
and of course having that option to
 
02:23:20.550 --> 02:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
allow for the university to institute a
 
02:23:22.469 --> 02:23:22.479 align:start position:0%
vaccine mandate
 
02:23:24.150 --> 02:23:24.160 align:start position:0%
would allow for the highest level of
 
02:23:25.830 --> 02:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
safety that we can provide for our
 
02:23:28.710 --> 02:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
students faculty and staff thank you
 
02:23:30.550 --> 02:23:30.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there questions
 
02:23:32.630 --> 02:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
from the committee yes represent luna
 
02:23:34.150 --> 02:23:34.160 align:start position:0%
sure thank you very much and thank you
 
02:23:36.150 --> 02:23:36.160 align:start position:0%
very much mr howard for uh for joining
 
02:23:38.710 --> 02:23:38.720 align:start position:0%
us this morning um i don't really expect
 
02:23:41.750 --> 02:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
you to have a a detailed answer to uh to
 
02:23:44.230 --> 02:23:44.240 align:start position:0%
this question but would you expect that
 
02:23:46.950 --> 02:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
in a community
 
02:23:48.710 --> 02:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
such as unh
 
02:23:51.110 --> 02:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
where i think you've got close to
 
02:23:53.910 --> 02:23:53.920 align:start position:0%
what sixteen thousand
 
02:23:55.910 --> 02:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
i believe something like that yeah yeah
 
02:23:58.469 --> 02:23:58.479 align:start position:0%
plus uh plus faculty and staff
 
02:24:00.230 --> 02:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
that that among this community
 
02:24:02.309 --> 02:24:02.319 align:start position:0%
population that there may be people with
 
02:24:04.469 --> 02:24:04.479 align:start position:0%
disabilities including compromised
 
02:24:06.790 --> 02:24:06.800 align:start position:0%
immune systems and other um
 
02:24:09.030 --> 02:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
other um uh conditions that might place
 
02:24:10.710 --> 02:24:10.720 align:start position:0%
them at higher risk
 
02:24:12.950 --> 02:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
than say um
 
02:24:14.630 --> 02:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
well that may just place them at higher
 
02:24:18.710 --> 02:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
risk yeah of course uh so personally uh
 
02:24:18.720 --> 02:24:19.429 align:start position:0%
risk yeah of course uh so personally uh
i

02:24:19.429 --> 02:24:19.439 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:24:22.070 --> 02:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
i've had two major back surgeries uh one
 
02:24:24.950 --> 02:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
of which was in 2020 uh of course you
 
02:24:26.950 --> 02:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
know that put me in one of the higher
 
02:24:29.190 --> 02:24:29.200 align:start position:0%
risk groups
 
02:24:30.790 --> 02:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
of course i'm triple vaccinated and i
 
02:24:33.750 --> 02:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
got the vaccine as soon as i was able to
 
02:24:35.270 --> 02:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
um i know
 
02:24:37.270 --> 02:24:37.280 align:start position:0%
of several other
 
02:24:39.030 --> 02:24:39.040 align:start position:0%
students who have immune
 
02:24:41.190 --> 02:24:41.200 align:start position:0%
immunocompromised systems
 
02:24:43.590 --> 02:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
who have also gotten the vaccine
 
02:24:46.389 --> 02:24:46.399 align:start position:0%
and it does make them feel a bit safer
 
02:24:47.910 --> 02:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
of course they're still worried about
 
02:24:50.309 --> 02:24:50.319 align:start position:0%
the possibility of getting kovid
 
02:24:50.319 --> 02:24:51.190 align:start position:0%
the possibility of getting kovid
and

02:24:51.190 --> 02:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:24:53.030 --> 02:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
you know that's that's a worry for all
 
02:24:54.309 --> 02:24:54.319 align:start position:0%
of our students
 
02:24:58.230 --> 02:24:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:00.230 --> 02:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there further
 
02:25:01.910 --> 02:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee not seeing
 
02:25:03.990 --> 02:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
hands thank you very much
 
02:25:06.309 --> 02:25:06.319 align:start position:0%
and our last pink card which we have on
 
02:25:12.870 --> 02:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:17.349 --> 02:25:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:18.870 --> 02:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:25:20.870 --> 02:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
i keep hearing the word safety thrown
 
02:25:20.880 --> 02:25:21.990 align:start position:0%
i keep hearing the word safety thrown
around

02:25:21.990 --> 02:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
around
 
02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:23.110 align:start position:0%
around
but

02:25:23.110 --> 02:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:25:26.710 --> 02:25:26.720 align:start position:0%
safety isn't being defined specifically
 
02:25:29.110 --> 02:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
and and scientifically
 
02:25:32.389 --> 02:25:32.399 align:start position:0%
so that's just a comment that um
 
02:25:35.990 --> 02:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
the people who are in in favor of these
 
02:25:38.469 --> 02:25:38.479 align:start position:0%
limitations to our freedoms
 
02:25:42.870 --> 02:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
are all voicing the word safety
 
02:25:42.880 --> 02:25:45.110 align:start position:0%
are all voicing the word safety
um

02:25:45.110 --> 02:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:47.990 --> 02:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
i'm kind of puzzled about this bill
 
02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:49.110 align:start position:0%
i'm kind of puzzled about this bill
because

02:25:49.110 --> 02:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:25:52.870 --> 02:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
it appears to be a hypothetical because
 
02:25:55.030 --> 02:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
it's saying well we don't have a vaccine
 
02:25:58.630 --> 02:25:58.640 align:start position:0%
requirement for these state universities
 
02:25:58.640 --> 02:25:59.590 align:start position:0%
requirement for these state universities
so

02:25:59.590 --> 02:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:26:03.429 --> 02:26:03.439 align:start position:0%
why is it actually being proposed
 
02:26:05.510 --> 02:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
if we don't have a vaccine requirement
 
02:26:07.830 --> 02:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
then why are we
 
02:26:12.070 --> 02:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
kind of preemptively wanting to exempt
 
02:26:14.870 --> 02:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh medical freedoms from immunizations
 
02:26:17.830 --> 02:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
i'm really puzzled by that
 
02:26:20.550 --> 02:26:20.560 align:start position:0%
so i have to start there
 
02:26:20.560 --> 02:26:22.070 align:start position:0%
so i have to start there
also

02:26:22.070 --> 02:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
also
 
02:26:24.630 --> 02:26:24.640 align:start position:0%
vaccines are not vaccines all the old
 
02:26:27.750 --> 02:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
vaccines are dna vaccines they were
 
02:26:30.630 --> 02:26:30.640 align:start position:0%
studied and observed for
 
02:26:32.790 --> 02:26:32.800 align:start position:0%
adverse events for all kinds of
 
02:26:36.550 --> 02:26:36.560 align:start position:0%
connections for decades and decades and
 
02:26:38.710 --> 02:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
so we don't know
 
02:26:40.790 --> 02:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
that the current vaccine
 
02:26:43.110 --> 02:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
in quotes is safe
 
02:26:45.510 --> 02:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
and effective we know it's not effective
 
02:26:49.190 --> 02:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
in transmission and infection rates
 
02:26:51.670 --> 02:26:51.680 align:start position:0%
i have a daughter who had a very serious
 
02:26:53.270 --> 02:26:53.280 align:start position:0%
adverse event
 
02:26:55.349 --> 02:26:55.359 align:start position:0%
immediately following the johnson and
 
02:26:57.820 --> 02:26:57.830 align:start position:0%
johnson vaccine
 
02:26:57.830 --> 02:27:00.150 align:start position:0%
johnson vaccine
[Music]

02:27:00.150 --> 02:27:00.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:27:03.030 --> 02:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
i reported it as a serious adverse event
 
02:27:05.670 --> 02:27:05.680 align:start position:0%
to the fda and to the company which
 
02:27:07.990 --> 02:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
ought to be the pattern for everyone so
 
02:27:11.510 --> 02:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
that the numbers of adverse events it is
 
02:27:13.910 --> 02:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
closer to being accurate
 
02:27:16.630 --> 02:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
i can assure you she will never receive
 
02:27:19.190 --> 02:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
another rna vaccine
 
02:27:19.200 --> 02:27:20.710 align:start position:0%
another rna vaccine
um

02:27:20.710 --> 02:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:23.910 --> 02:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
and she is of college age so if this if
 
02:27:26.070 --> 02:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
this were put in place and that and the
 
02:27:27.990 --> 02:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
in the university all of a sudden
 
02:27:30.710 --> 02:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
decided well we are now going to
 
02:27:33.110 --> 02:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
require a vaccine
 
02:27:35.270 --> 02:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
this person has now had a serious
 
02:27:37.990 --> 02:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
adverse event
 
02:27:40.790 --> 02:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
is she going to get a medical exemption
 
02:27:43.990 --> 02:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
i'm curious on the number of medical and
 
02:27:45.510 --> 02:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
other exemptions
 
02:27:47.510 --> 02:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
that the university system here has
 
02:27:49.510 --> 02:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
actually granted
 
02:27:52.150 --> 02:27:52.160 align:start position:0%
so i think that question needs to be
 
02:27:52.160 --> 02:27:53.429 align:start position:0%
so i think that question needs to be
answered

02:27:53.429 --> 02:27:53.439 align:start position:0%
answered
 
02:27:55.990 --> 02:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
instead of uh well we'll make some kind
 
02:27:58.070 --> 02:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
of an agreement with a student who can't
 
02:28:00.710 --> 02:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
wear a mask or can't have a vaccine
 
02:28:02.630 --> 02:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
we'll work something out i want to know
 
02:28:04.630 --> 02:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
what the numbers are that they have
 
02:28:07.349 --> 02:28:07.359 align:start position:0%
actually granted so far
 
02:28:09.750 --> 02:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
i am definitely not in favor of this
 
02:28:12.550 --> 02:28:12.560 align:start position:0%
bill thank you
 
02:28:19.190 --> 02:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:20.790 --> 02:28:20.800 align:start position:0%
question are you aware that johnson and
 
02:28:23.750 --> 02:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
johnson is not in our mna next
 
02:28:27.190 --> 02:28:27.200 align:start position:0%
mrna vaccine it's not a dna vaccine well
 
02:28:28.950 --> 02:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
it's a traditional vaccine it's not the
 
02:28:30.710 --> 02:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
new technology
 
02:28:33.590 --> 02:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
it's a vector vaccine not an rna right
 
02:28:35.990 --> 02:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
but it but it is grouped with the other
 
02:28:39.270 --> 02:28:39.280 align:start position:0%
vaccines and it is so recently developed
 
02:28:42.070 --> 02:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
that there is no long-term safety
 
02:28:43.750 --> 02:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
associated with it
 
02:28:45.590 --> 02:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
so my question to you is if johnson
 
02:28:48.950 --> 02:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
johnson is not an mrna vaccine why are
 
02:28:50.150 --> 02:28:50.160 align:start position:0%
you saying your daughter will never
 
02:28:52.389 --> 02:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
receive another one mrna because it
 
02:28:54.550 --> 02:28:54.560 align:start position:0%
sounds like she never received an
 
02:28:56.950 --> 02:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
rna vaccine
 
02:28:59.429 --> 02:28:59.439 align:start position:0%
she she won't receive any further ones
 
02:29:01.670 --> 02:29:01.680 align:start position:0%
or boosters because of the serious
 
02:29:04.550 --> 02:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
adverse event she had to this
 
02:29:07.510 --> 02:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
and and the type of reaction she had is
 
02:29:10.630 --> 02:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
very commonly associated with pfizer and
 
02:29:14.070 --> 02:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
the moderna so it's there is overlap of
 
02:29:20.150 --> 02:29:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:22.070 --> 02:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
further questions not seeing any hands
 
02:29:23.910 --> 02:29:23.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and our last person
 
02:29:33.590 --> 02:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:35.349 --> 02:29:35.359 align:start position:0%
hi i'm mary sawwitch i didn't say before
 
02:29:37.990 --> 02:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
that i'm from hancock
 
02:29:41.349 --> 02:29:41.359 align:start position:0%
i oppose this bill
 
02:29:43.670 --> 02:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
because i'm hearing the testimony i
 
02:29:46.790 --> 02:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
really liked what she just said before
 
02:29:46.800 --> 02:29:48.309 align:start position:0%
really liked what she just said before
about

02:29:48.309 --> 02:29:48.319 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:29:50.550 --> 02:29:50.560 align:start position:0%
all the adverse effects and i just want
 
02:29:53.750 --> 02:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
to add one little thing um
 
02:29:56.070 --> 02:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
please look up christine northrup
 
02:29:58.550 --> 02:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
she was um
 
02:30:00.150 --> 02:30:00.160 align:start position:0%
probably one of the most noted
 
02:30:02.230 --> 02:30:02.240 align:start position:0%
gynecologists in the country until
 
02:30:03.429 --> 02:30:03.439 align:start position:0%
coveted hit
 
02:30:04.710 --> 02:30:04.720 align:start position:0%
and then
 
02:30:08.150 --> 02:30:08.160 align:start position:0%
her popularity went down to nothing
 
02:30:10.630 --> 02:30:10.640 align:start position:0%
she has been seeing
 
02:30:12.550 --> 02:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
women young women
 
02:30:17.030 --> 02:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:19.590 --> 02:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
even older women like menopausal women
 
02:30:19.600 --> 02:30:20.790 align:start position:0%
even older women like menopausal women
bleeding

02:30:20.790 --> 02:30:20.800 align:start position:0%
bleeding
 
02:30:23.910 --> 02:30:23.920 align:start position:0%
women that are young um having all
 
02:30:27.030 --> 02:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
different types of gynecological issues
 
02:30:29.349 --> 02:30:29.359 align:start position:0%
and i really encourage you to do your
 
02:30:31.750 --> 02:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
research and look that up because we're
 
02:30:33.270 --> 02:30:33.280 align:start position:0%
our young people
 
02:30:35.590 --> 02:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
this vaccine it looks like on the
 
02:30:39.270 --> 02:30:39.280 align:start position:0%
outside oh i didn't get an effect um
 
02:30:42.309 --> 02:30:42.319 align:start position:0%
today and tomorrow but you could have
 
02:30:44.389 --> 02:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
this long-term effect that you won't
 
02:30:46.710 --> 02:30:46.720 align:start position:0%
find out until
 
02:30:49.750 --> 02:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
you know you want to bear children
 
02:30:49.760 --> 02:30:51.190 align:start position:0%
you know you want to bear children
or

02:30:51.190 --> 02:30:51.200 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:30:53.510 --> 02:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
anything in the in the future
 
02:30:55.510 --> 02:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
and it can possibly cause cancer you
 
02:30:59.190 --> 02:30:59.200 align:start position:0%
don't know what this vaccine could do
 
02:31:02.309 --> 02:31:02.319 align:start position:0%
so um i've listened to lots of the
 
02:31:04.630 --> 02:31:04.640 align:start position:0%
alternative the news max and
 
02:31:08.309 --> 02:31:08.319 align:start position:0%
and um all the different uh
 
02:31:10.870 --> 02:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
news is that talk about the effects of
 
02:31:12.710 --> 02:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
this vaccine and i really encourage you
 
02:31:14.710 --> 02:31:14.720 align:start position:0%
to oppose this
 
02:31:17.110 --> 02:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
bill thank you thank you very much any
 
02:31:17.120 --> 02:31:18.150 align:start position:0%
bill thank you thank you very much any
questions

02:31:18.150 --> 02:31:18.160 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:31:20.469 --> 02:31:20.479 align:start position:0%
nope that's okay
 
02:31:21.510 --> 02:31:21.520 align:start position:0%
we're done
 
02:31:26.150 --> 02:31:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:27.670 --> 02:31:27.680 align:start position:0%
and we're going to start the next
 
02:31:29.190 --> 02:31:29.200 align:start position:0%
hearing in about five minutes i want
 
02:31:30.389 --> 02:31:30.399 align:start position:0%
everybody have a chance to get up and
 
02:31:50.950 --> 02:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:50.960 --> 02:32:05.270 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:32:05.270 --> 02:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:06.630 --> 02:32:06.640 align:start position:0%
oh yeah
 
02:32:08.309 --> 02:32:08.319 align:start position:0%
but you know
 
02:32:47.270 --> 02:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:57.910 --> 02:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:27.750 --> 02:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:50.150 --> 02:33:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:50.160 --> 02:34:12.630 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:34:12.630 --> 02:34:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:12.640 --> 02:34:23.750 align:start position:0%
 
is

02:34:23.750 --> 02:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:57.349 --> 02:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:59.510 --> 02:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
i mean i was interested in learning
 
02:35:01.510 --> 02:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
but i was also interested in having a
 
02:35:03.030 --> 02:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
social experience that was really
 
02:35:03.040 --> 02:35:06.150 align:start position:0%
social experience that was really
important

02:35:06.150 --> 02:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:09.110 --> 02:35:09.120 align:start position:0%
dramatically yeah it's something where
 
02:35:09.120 --> 02:35:19.110 align:start position:0%
dramatically yeah it's something where
um

02:35:19.110 --> 02:35:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:19.120 --> 02:35:37.270 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:35:37.270 --> 02:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:37.280 --> 02:35:38.710 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:35:38.710 --> 02:35:38.720 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:35:40.950 --> 02:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
so kind of as i mentioned in my
 
02:35:43.990 --> 02:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
testimony uh i have had a back surgery
 
02:35:46.710 --> 02:35:46.720 align:start position:0%
so i have kind of had a bit of sure
 
02:35:48.710 --> 02:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
off college experience thus far sure
 
02:35:51.870 --> 02:35:51.880 align:start position:0%
kind of taken some semesters
 
02:35:55.990 --> 02:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
off yeah well um this is a good
 
02:35:57.990 --> 02:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
education yeah
 
02:36:04.550 --> 02:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:20.389 --> 02:36:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:33.349 --> 02:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:34.950 --> 02:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
i haven't thought about it all that much
 
02:36:36.309 --> 02:36:36.319 align:start position:0%
cool um
 
02:36:37.429 --> 02:36:37.439 align:start position:0%
cool but
 
02:36:43.670 --> 02:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:45.750 --> 02:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
hopefully you know we need more young
 
02:36:47.030 --> 02:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
where do you
 
02:37:38.870 --> 02:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:38.880 --> 02:37:58.790 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:37:58.790 --> 02:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:27.349 --> 02:43:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:29.830 --> 02:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
okay folks we need to get moving here on
 
02:43:34.710 --> 02:43:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:37.429 --> 02:43:37.439 align:start position:0%
this is hb 1637 requiring parents of
 
02:43:39.190 --> 02:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
public school students to submit a
 
02:43:41.510 --> 02:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
survey when electing an education
 
02:43:46.469 --> 02:43:46.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:49.590 --> 02:43:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:55.990 --> 02:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:58.790 --> 02:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
okay representative chase you're here to
 
02:44:01.429 --> 02:44:01.439 align:start position:0%
present the bill i'm still looking it up
 
02:44:03.670 --> 02:44:03.680 align:start position:0%
there we go yeah there you are thank you
 
02:44:05.030 --> 02:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
02:44:06.230 --> 02:44:06.240 align:start position:0%
thank you to the committee for letting
 
02:44:09.349 --> 02:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
me introduce house bill 1637 today this
 
02:44:11.429 --> 02:44:11.439 align:start position:0%
bill would require a parent submitting
 
02:44:12.950 --> 02:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
an application under the education
 
02:44:14.469 --> 02:44:14.479 align:start position:0%
freedom account if their child was
 
02:44:16.230 --> 02:44:16.240 align:start position:0%
previously full-time enrolled at a
 
02:44:17.590 --> 02:44:17.600 align:start position:0%
public school
 
02:44:20.309 --> 02:44:20.319 align:start position:0%
to um to complete and submit a survey
 
02:44:21.910 --> 02:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
issued by the department of education
 
02:44:23.269 --> 02:44:23.279 align:start position:0%
the reason for this survey is in the
 
02:44:25.030 --> 02:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
bill's language quote
 
02:44:26.630 --> 02:44:26.640 align:start position:0%
and this is lines i believe five and
 
02:44:28.469 --> 02:44:28.479 align:start position:0%
seven of the legislation five through
 
02:44:30.070 --> 02:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
seven um
 
02:44:31.990 --> 02:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
begins quote the survey shall be
 
02:44:33.190 --> 02:44:33.200 align:start position:0%
designed by the department for the
 
02:44:34.790 --> 02:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
purpose of ascertaining the reasons for
 
02:44:36.309 --> 02:44:36.319 align:start position:0%
the parents election to remove the
 
02:44:38.550 --> 02:44:38.560 align:start position:0%
student from this public school system
 
02:44:40.230 --> 02:44:40.240 align:start position:0%
and the parents receive benefits of
 
02:44:41.990 --> 02:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
utilizing an education freedom account
 
02:44:43.190 --> 02:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
the survey shall be returned to the
 
02:44:45.190 --> 02:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
department prior to acceptance into the
 
02:44:46.630 --> 02:44:46.640 align:start position:0%
fa program and shared with the
 
02:44:48.630 --> 02:44:48.640 align:start position:0%
administration of the local school
 
02:44:50.150 --> 02:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
district from which the student is
 
02:44:52.070 --> 02:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
leaving the reason i introduced this
 
02:44:53.510 --> 02:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
bill was to help my local school
 
02:44:54.870 --> 02:44:54.880 align:start position:0%
district and other school districts
 
02:44:56.790 --> 02:44:56.800 align:start position:0%
across the state figure out why students
 
02:44:59.510 --> 02:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
would choose to leave public education a
 
02:45:00.710 --> 02:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
survey will provide school
 
02:45:02.150 --> 02:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
administrators school boards in the
 
02:45:03.910 --> 02:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
department of education with vital
 
02:45:05.590 --> 02:45:05.600 align:start position:0%
information and data that can help
 
02:45:07.750 --> 02:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
improve public education it will make
 
02:45:09.990 --> 02:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
public education more responsive to
 
02:45:11.590 --> 02:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
students needs
 
02:45:13.269 --> 02:45:13.279 align:start position:0%
if people are obviously leaving you know
 
02:45:14.790 --> 02:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
our public school system they must have
 
02:45:17.030 --> 02:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
some kind of perceived you know reasons
 
02:45:18.309 --> 02:45:18.319 align:start position:0%
why they're leaving they must have a
 
02:45:19.830 --> 02:45:19.840 align:start position:0%
number of grievances and i think it's
 
02:45:22.550 --> 02:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
important for for our local policy
 
02:45:24.870 --> 02:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
makers and state policy makers to really
 
02:45:27.349 --> 02:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
understand you know why exactly and even
 
02:45:29.030 --> 02:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
more specific for different school
 
02:45:30.389 --> 02:45:30.399 align:start position:0%
districts since not every school
 
02:45:31.910 --> 02:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
district has the same problems as other
 
02:45:33.750 --> 02:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
school districts and not every school
 
02:45:35.429 --> 02:45:35.439 align:start position:0%
district has the same benefits as other
 
02:45:37.910 --> 02:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
school districts um if we do not know
 
02:45:39.510 --> 02:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
why parents are upset with a specific
 
02:45:41.830 --> 02:45:41.840 align:start position:0%
school or sau you know it's going to be
 
02:45:43.910 --> 02:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
tough to actually be able to improve
 
02:45:45.670 --> 02:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
right i mean part of the reason for the
 
02:45:47.830 --> 02:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
education freedom accounts was to create
 
02:45:50.630 --> 02:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
some you know some competition
 
02:45:52.550 --> 02:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
amongst you know education options and
 
02:45:55.110 --> 02:45:55.120 align:start position:0%
that was a big reason why myself i did
 
02:45:56.710 --> 02:45:56.720 align:start position:0%
support the efa program and i still
 
02:45:58.870 --> 02:45:58.880 align:start position:0%
support the efa program right being
 
02:46:00.870 --> 02:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
making sure that we have a public school
 
02:46:03.349 --> 02:46:03.359 align:start position:0%
system that is responsive to students
 
02:46:05.910 --> 02:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
needs but if school administrators and
 
02:46:07.590 --> 02:46:07.600 align:start position:0%
school board members and teachers don't
 
02:46:09.030 --> 02:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
understand why their students are
 
02:46:11.429 --> 02:46:11.439 align:start position:0%
leaving then it can be pretty difficult
 
02:46:13.510 --> 02:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
for them to be able to respond to those
 
02:46:15.349 --> 02:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
students uh their overall needs
 
02:46:16.710 --> 02:46:16.720 align:start position:0%
additionally the department of education
 
02:46:18.550 --> 02:46:18.560 align:start position:0%
school districts should find these very
 
02:46:20.469 --> 02:46:20.479 align:start position:0%
specific trends all the way down to the
 
02:46:22.469 --> 02:46:22.479 align:start position:0%
specific schools right even
 
02:46:24.630 --> 02:46:24.640 align:start position:0%
theoretically to specific you know
 
02:46:27.190 --> 02:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
courses or specific curriculum within
 
02:46:29.110 --> 02:46:29.120 align:start position:0%
schools school districts or even in
 
02:46:32.070 --> 02:46:32.080 align:start position:0%
different areas of the state
 
02:46:33.990 --> 02:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
and so i think it's important that we
 
02:46:35.750 --> 02:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
collect this data because more data is
 
02:46:37.910 --> 02:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
going to help us as local and state
 
02:46:40.309 --> 02:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
policy makers improve education all
 
02:46:42.150 --> 02:46:42.160 align:start position:0%
education right it's going to help us
 
02:46:44.469 --> 02:46:44.479 align:start position:0%
improve all education overall some of
 
02:46:45.750 --> 02:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
the data that's currently collected
 
02:46:48.150 --> 02:46:48.160 align:start position:0%
right now is mostly by
 
02:46:50.230 --> 02:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
outside third party groups i think it's
 
02:46:52.230 --> 02:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
good for public transparency for our
 
02:46:53.910 --> 02:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
state to be directly collecting this
 
02:46:56.230 --> 02:46:56.240 align:start position:0%
data so that we know that the data is
 
02:46:58.230 --> 02:46:58.240 align:start position:0%
clear transparent and that there's no
 
02:46:59.750 --> 02:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
kind of outside influence because you
 
02:47:01.510 --> 02:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
could conceivably see you know some
 
02:47:03.349 --> 02:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
groups that might be anti-efas trying to
 
02:47:04.710 --> 02:47:04.720 align:start position:0%
collect the data and say you know
 
02:47:06.550 --> 02:47:06.560 align:start position:0%
students are leaving for you know
 
02:47:08.790 --> 02:47:08.800 align:start position:0%
unrealistic reasons and some that are
 
02:47:10.870 --> 02:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
very pro efa saying students are leaving
 
02:47:12.630 --> 02:47:12.640 align:start position:0%
because public education is terrible i
 
02:47:14.150 --> 02:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
think we want to get data that's the
 
02:47:16.950 --> 02:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
most transparent that's the most clear
 
02:47:18.230 --> 02:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
and that's going to be able to really
 
02:47:21.349 --> 02:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
inform all of us as to one you know why
 
02:47:23.429 --> 02:47:23.439 align:start position:0%
people are using efas and what kind of
 
02:47:25.030 --> 02:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
benefits that they're getting from that
 
02:47:26.309 --> 02:47:26.319 align:start position:0%
and to
 
02:47:28.790 --> 02:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
why people feel as if their their public
 
02:47:30.630 --> 02:47:30.640 align:start position:0%
school systems or their local districts
 
02:47:32.710 --> 02:47:32.720 align:start position:0%
might be failing them
 
02:47:35.750 --> 02:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
so with that i'll uh i'll yield to
 
02:47:37.349 --> 02:47:37.359 align:start position:0%
any well i'll mention one actually one
 
02:47:39.590 --> 02:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
last thing and one concern that i saw
 
02:47:40.870 --> 02:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
which i thought was a very good concern
 
02:47:42.469 --> 02:47:42.479 align:start position:0%
that was brought up by um someone from
 
02:47:45.510 --> 02:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
nashua was um the anonymity of the
 
02:47:47.269 --> 02:47:47.279 align:start position:0%
survey and i think it would be a smart
 
02:47:49.590 --> 02:47:49.600 align:start position:0%
idea for the committee to update it to
 
02:47:51.910 --> 02:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
make it so the survey is anonymous so
 
02:47:51.920 --> 02:47:52.710 align:start position:0%
make it so the survey is anonymous so
then

02:47:52.710 --> 02:47:52.720 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:47:54.469 --> 02:47:54.479 align:start position:0%
people aren't scared about sharing
 
02:47:56.309 --> 02:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
honest and earnest feedback and i think
 
02:47:57.830 --> 02:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
the one way to do that would just be to
 
02:48:01.190 --> 02:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
add before the term survey anonymous
 
02:48:02.870 --> 02:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
you just added that word you know
 
02:48:04.150 --> 02:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
throughout the legislation which i think
 
02:48:05.510 --> 02:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
the term surveys mentioned you know
 
02:48:07.190 --> 02:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
maybe three or four times i think that
 
02:48:08.950 --> 02:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
would be a great way to make sure that
 
02:48:10.550 --> 02:48:10.560 align:start position:0%
you know students who are sharing this
 
02:48:11.590 --> 02:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
and parents who are sharing this
 
02:48:13.910 --> 02:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
information don't feel as if that you
 
02:48:15.429 --> 02:48:15.439 align:start position:0%
know that they can't be earnest and
 
02:48:17.190 --> 02:48:17.200 align:start position:0%
honest and that they don't feel as if if
 
02:48:19.110 --> 02:48:19.120 align:start position:0%
they go back to the public school system
 
02:48:20.309 --> 02:48:20.319 align:start position:0%
that there'll be any kind of you know
 
02:48:23.269 --> 02:48:23.279 align:start position:0%
perceived retribution um and then we
 
02:48:25.269 --> 02:48:25.279 align:start position:0%
still get the data overall that uh
 
02:48:27.030 --> 02:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
people might feel as if it's necessary
 
02:48:28.710 --> 02:48:28.720 align:start position:0%
to be able to continue improving public
 
02:48:30.950 --> 02:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
education and address
 
02:48:33.030 --> 02:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
students needs and with that i'll yield
 
02:48:34.950 --> 02:48:34.960 align:start position:0%
to any questions thank you are there any
 
02:48:37.670 --> 02:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
questions representative cordelli
 
02:48:38.870 --> 02:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
02:48:38.880 --> 02:48:40.070 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
representative

02:48:40.070 --> 02:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:48:41.910 --> 02:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
um i'm just
 
02:48:44.790 --> 02:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
wondering why you're concerned with just
 
02:48:47.429 --> 02:48:47.439 align:start position:0%
efa students leaving
 
02:48:49.030 --> 02:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
the school
 
02:48:50.469 --> 02:48:50.479 align:start position:0%
i think you're familiar with the
 
02:48:52.870 --> 02:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
governor wentworth district
 
02:48:52.880 --> 02:48:54.070 align:start position:0%
governor wentworth district
and

02:48:54.070 --> 02:48:54.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:48:56.070 --> 02:48:56.080 align:start position:0%
as of october
 
02:49:00.550 --> 02:49:00.560 align:start position:0%
the enrollment decline was 104 students
 
02:49:00.560 --> 02:49:01.269 align:start position:0%
the enrollment decline was 104 students
but

02:49:01.269 --> 02:49:01.279 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:49:05.429 --> 02:49:05.439 align:start position:0%
13 from wolfeboro left for efas
 
02:49:08.550 --> 02:49:08.560 align:start position:0%
you don't care about why the other 81
 
02:49:08.560 --> 02:49:09.510 align:start position:0%
you don't care about why the other 81
students

02:49:09.510 --> 02:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
students
 
02:49:09.520 --> 02:49:10.469 align:start position:0%
students
left

02:49:10.469 --> 02:49:10.479 align:start position:0%
left
 
02:49:12.710 --> 02:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
the school oh of course and i think um
 
02:49:14.469 --> 02:49:14.479 align:start position:0%
if the you know if the committee
 
02:49:16.309 --> 02:49:16.319 align:start position:0%
believes that we should expand it to all
 
02:49:17.990 --> 02:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
students leaving the school district but
 
02:49:19.590 --> 02:49:19.600 align:start position:0%
there's also a question too of of those
 
02:49:21.910 --> 02:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
104 i mean the vast majority that you're
 
02:49:24.389 --> 02:49:24.399 align:start position:0%
speaking about left because of either
 
02:49:26.389 --> 02:49:26.399 align:start position:0%
you know was a decline so it might have
 
02:49:27.590 --> 02:49:27.600 align:start position:0%
been graduation right some of our
 
02:49:30.070 --> 02:49:30.080 align:start position:0%
biggest classes are currently i mean
 
02:49:32.150 --> 02:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
maybe i'm mistaken but um and people may
 
02:49:34.230 --> 02:49:34.240 align:start position:0%
be moving out of district two
 
02:49:35.510 --> 02:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
right so there might be a number of
 
02:49:37.830 --> 02:49:37.840 align:start position:0%
other reasons but i think um if someone
 
02:49:39.429 --> 02:49:39.439 align:start position:0%
is leaving the district i think that's a
 
02:49:40.790 --> 02:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
good point i think maybe we should
 
02:49:43.750 --> 02:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
expand this past jesse of phase
 
02:49:43.760 --> 02:49:45.110 align:start position:0%
expand this past jesse of phase
follow-up

02:49:45.110 --> 02:49:45.120 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:49:48.150 --> 02:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
thank you um how about if
 
02:49:50.790 --> 02:49:50.800 align:start position:0%
at the end of the year you survey
 
02:49:52.389 --> 02:49:52.399 align:start position:0%
all parents
 
02:49:55.590 --> 02:49:55.600 align:start position:0%
in the school or in the district to see
 
02:49:57.750 --> 02:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
their satisfaction it could be that
 
02:49:59.110 --> 02:49:59.120 align:start position:0%
they're living
 
02:50:01.510 --> 02:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
next year but this way you'll get a full
 
02:50:03.830 --> 02:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
picture of everyone in the school
 
02:50:06.230 --> 02:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
and their degree of satisfaction with
 
02:50:08.230 --> 02:50:08.240 align:start position:0%
their child's education would you
 
02:50:10.070 --> 02:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
support something like that i saw that
 
02:50:11.429 --> 02:50:11.439 align:start position:0%
you had a legislation billing for that
 
02:50:13.190 --> 02:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
and i 100 to support it i think it's a
 
02:50:15.030 --> 02:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
great idea i think it's good i think
 
02:50:16.550 --> 02:50:16.560 align:start position:0%
it's good to get everyone's satisfaction
 
02:50:18.150 --> 02:50:18.160 align:start position:0%
but i think it's also good to know
 
02:50:19.990 --> 02:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
because you have to
 
02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:21.349 align:start position:0%
because you have to
so

02:50:21.349 --> 02:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:50:22.790 --> 02:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
and maybe i'm wrong and you can correct
 
02:50:25.030 --> 02:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
me mr vice chairman but we wouldn't be
 
02:50:26.550 --> 02:50:26.560 align:start position:0%
able to collect the data for the
 
02:50:27.830 --> 02:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
students that have already left it would
 
02:50:29.670 --> 02:50:29.680 align:start position:0%
only be the students that are currently
 
02:50:30.950 --> 02:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
in the school district i think it's
 
02:50:32.309 --> 02:50:32.319 align:start position:0%
still important to know why someone has
 
02:50:34.550 --> 02:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
made that full you know jump into the
 
02:50:36.630 --> 02:50:36.640 align:start position:0%
program maybe you know maybe i'm
 
02:50:38.389 --> 02:50:38.399 align:start position:0%
mistaken maybe the committee and other
 
02:50:40.710 --> 02:50:40.720 align:start position:0%
members can you know um can set me
 
02:50:42.309 --> 02:50:42.319 align:start position:0%
straight but um i think it's important
 
02:50:44.469 --> 02:50:44.479 align:start position:0%
for us to get as much data as we can and
 
02:50:46.309 --> 02:50:46.319 align:start position:0%
if you know between your bill and maybe
 
02:50:48.309 --> 02:50:48.319 align:start position:0%
an amended version of this bill we could
 
02:50:51.429 --> 02:50:51.439 align:start position:0%
really maximize that data collection
 
02:50:51.439 --> 02:50:52.550 align:start position:0%
really maximize that data collection
great

02:50:52.550 --> 02:50:52.560 align:start position:0%
great
 
02:50:54.389 --> 02:50:54.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:50:54.399 --> 02:50:56.150 align:start position:0%
thank you
just

02:50:56.150 --> 02:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:50:59.750 --> 02:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
the efa program the current law does not
 
02:50:59.760 --> 02:51:01.349 align:start position:0%
the efa program the current law does not
require

02:51:01.349 --> 02:51:01.359 align:start position:0%
require
 
02:51:02.790 --> 02:51:02.800 align:start position:0%
a survey
 
02:51:04.790 --> 02:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
of parents
 
02:51:07.190 --> 02:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
as does the tax credit scholarship
 
02:51:07.200 --> 02:51:08.389 align:start position:0%
as does the tax credit scholarship
program

02:51:08.389 --> 02:51:08.399 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:51:08.399 --> 02:51:09.990 align:start position:0%
program
but

02:51:09.990 --> 02:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:51:12.870 --> 02:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
would you believe that i talked to
 
02:51:15.110 --> 02:51:15.120 align:start position:0%
children's scholarship fund and they
 
02:51:16.870 --> 02:51:16.880 align:start position:0%
will voluntarily
 
02:51:20.150 --> 02:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
work with the department and dra to come
 
02:51:22.710 --> 02:51:22.720 align:start position:0%
up with a survey to send to
 
02:51:22.720 --> 02:51:24.070 align:start position:0%
up with a survey to send to
efa's

02:51:24.070 --> 02:51:24.080 align:start position:0%
efa's
 
02:51:24.080 --> 02:51:25.429 align:start position:0%
efa's
families

02:51:25.429 --> 02:51:25.439 align:start position:0%
families
 
02:51:27.590 --> 02:51:27.600 align:start position:0%
i would um i i would certainly believe
 
02:51:27.600 --> 02:51:28.950 align:start position:0%
i would um i i would certainly believe
that

02:51:28.950 --> 02:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:51:30.790 --> 02:51:30.800 align:start position:0%
in working with the department i still i
 
02:51:33.269 --> 02:51:33.279 align:start position:0%
think there's some merit in
 
02:51:34.790 --> 02:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
because we don't know how you know i
 
02:51:36.950 --> 02:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
assume this this this program is going
 
02:51:38.790 --> 02:51:38.800 align:start position:0%
to exist for an eternity right it's
 
02:51:40.389 --> 02:51:40.399 align:start position:0%
going to continue to exist as long as we
 
02:51:42.630 --> 02:51:42.640 align:start position:0%
have a public education system and
 
02:51:44.230 --> 02:51:44.240 align:start position:0%
theoretically there could be you know
 
02:51:46.070 --> 02:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
different kinds of groups that end up in
 
02:51:48.230 --> 02:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
the future you know 50 years from now
 
02:51:49.910 --> 02:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
operating the program and the program is
 
02:51:51.110 --> 02:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
definitely going to shift and change
 
02:51:53.269 --> 02:51:53.279 align:start position:0%
over the next 50 years i think it's good
 
02:51:55.750 --> 02:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
for us to have in statutory law
 
02:51:58.630 --> 02:51:58.640 align:start position:0%
some kind of data collection requirement
 
02:52:00.150 --> 02:52:00.160 align:start position:0%
and for us to be able to collect that
 
02:52:01.750 --> 02:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
and be able to aggregate that and to
 
02:52:04.150 --> 02:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
better understand students needs but i
 
02:52:05.910 --> 02:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
definitely think you know if for the
 
02:52:07.269 --> 02:52:07.279 align:start position:0%
time being
 
02:52:08.790 --> 02:52:08.800 align:start position:0%
the scholarship organization working
 
02:52:09.830 --> 02:52:09.840 align:start position:0%
with the department of education if
 
02:52:10.790 --> 02:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
they're willing to do that i think
 
02:52:13.030 --> 02:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
that's a great thing for all students in
 
02:52:15.269 --> 02:52:15.279 align:start position:0%
our state for the program itself and for
 
02:52:16.710 --> 02:52:16.720 align:start position:0%
public education i think it's a
 
02:52:16.720 --> 02:52:18.550 align:start position:0%
public education i think it's a
win-win-win

02:52:18.550 --> 02:52:18.560 align:start position:0%
win-win-win
 
02:52:23.030 --> 02:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:24.469 --> 02:52:24.479 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
02:52:26.150 --> 02:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:52:28.230 --> 02:52:28.240 align:start position:0%
um i noticed when you talked about the
 
02:52:31.190 --> 02:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
survey and you were talked about
 
02:52:33.190 --> 02:52:33.200 align:start position:0%
parents grievances
 
02:52:35.349 --> 02:52:35.359 align:start position:0%
why they were upset
 
02:52:37.590 --> 02:52:37.600 align:start position:0%
and why the school had failed their
 
02:52:37.600 --> 02:52:38.790 align:start position:0%
and why the school had failed their
student

02:52:38.790 --> 02:52:38.800 align:start position:0%
student
 
02:52:38.800 --> 02:52:39.590 align:start position:0%
student
um

02:52:39.590 --> 02:52:39.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:52:41.340 --> 02:52:41.350 align:start position:0%
and it sounds like
 
02:52:41.350 --> 02:52:43.030 align:start position:0%
and it sounds like
[Music]

02:52:43.030 --> 02:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:52:45.110 --> 02:52:45.120 align:start position:0%
that that's the only reason people leave
 
02:52:45.120 --> 02:52:46.950 align:start position:0%
that that's the only reason people leave
school

02:52:46.950 --> 02:52:46.960 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:52:48.469 --> 02:52:48.479 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering
 
02:52:48.479 --> 02:52:49.349 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering
if

02:52:49.349 --> 02:52:49.359 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:52:52.150 --> 02:52:52.160 align:start position:0%
you have any indication
 
02:52:54.230 --> 02:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
and any assurance to me that the survey
 
02:52:56.469 --> 02:52:56.479 align:start position:0%
will be
 
02:53:00.070 --> 02:53:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:02.630 --> 02:53:02.640 align:start position:0%
set up a situation where all we hear are
 
02:53:05.269 --> 02:53:05.279 align:start position:0%
grievances upset parents and failing
 
02:53:05.279 --> 02:53:09.030 align:start position:0%
grievances upset parents and failing
students

02:53:09.030 --> 02:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:10.870 --> 02:53:10.880 align:start position:0%
well i can i wouldn't be able to promise
 
02:53:12.309 --> 02:53:12.319 align:start position:0%
that because the point of the survey is
 
02:53:14.469 --> 02:53:14.479 align:start position:0%
to find out grievances um i think the
 
02:53:16.230 --> 02:53:16.240 align:start position:0%
department and i trust our department of
 
02:53:17.750 --> 02:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
education would do a fair
 
02:53:19.590 --> 02:53:19.600 align:start position:0%
job of wording a survey in a way that
 
02:53:21.269 --> 02:53:21.279 align:start position:0%
would be trying to get you know
 
02:53:22.950 --> 02:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
objective kind of data but obviously
 
02:53:24.550 --> 02:53:24.560 align:start position:0%
people are leaving the system are upset
 
02:53:25.830 --> 02:53:25.840 align:start position:0%
but i think it's important that we find
 
02:53:27.510 --> 02:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
out why they're upset right and what
 
02:53:30.309 --> 02:53:30.319 align:start position:0%
exactly their largest um
 
02:53:33.190 --> 02:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
kind of current complaints are with the
 
02:53:35.110 --> 02:53:35.120 align:start position:0%
current public education system and how
 
02:53:36.550 --> 02:53:36.560 align:start position:0%
we can continue to improve public
 
02:53:39.190 --> 02:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
education to address those concerns
 
02:53:40.309 --> 02:53:40.319 align:start position:0%
because i think that's you know we need
 
02:53:42.309 --> 02:53:42.319 align:start position:0%
to recognize public education as
 
02:53:43.830 --> 02:53:43.840 align:start position:0%
somewhat and this is someone who is a
 
02:53:45.349 --> 02:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
product of public education it's gotten
 
02:53:48.309 --> 02:53:48.319 align:start position:0%
fairly stale and in some ways it's not
 
02:53:49.830 --> 02:53:49.840 align:start position:0%
reaching to every child's potential and
 
02:53:52.070 --> 02:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
that was part of the reason for the efas
 
02:53:53.750 --> 02:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
but if we don't have any kind of data of
 
02:53:55.910 --> 02:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
how to tell our public school systems of
 
02:53:57.590 --> 02:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
how to improve and why students are
 
02:53:58.950 --> 02:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
leaving the you know the public
 
02:54:00.790 --> 02:54:00.800 align:start position:0%
education system and
 
02:54:02.790 --> 02:54:02.800 align:start position:0%
i think it's going to be more difficult
 
02:54:04.550 --> 02:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
for us to be able to react and to
 
02:54:07.830 --> 02:54:07.840 align:start position:0%
respond to the public's demands
 
02:54:10.230 --> 02:54:10.240 align:start position:0%
yes you may
 
02:54:12.070 --> 02:54:12.080 align:start position:0%
so it's my understanding
 
02:54:15.030 --> 02:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
that a large majority of these students
 
02:54:17.110 --> 02:54:17.120 align:start position:0%
leave the public school and are going to
 
02:54:18.550 --> 02:54:18.560 align:start position:0%
religious schools
 
02:54:21.269 --> 02:54:21.279 align:start position:0%
and i would think that if a parent
 
02:54:21.279 --> 02:54:22.469 align:start position:0%
and i would think that if a parent
wanted

02:54:22.469 --> 02:54:22.479 align:start position:0%
wanted
 
02:54:24.309 --> 02:54:24.319 align:start position:0%
their student to have a religious
 
02:54:27.190 --> 02:54:27.200 align:start position:0%
education in a particular religious
 
02:54:27.200 --> 02:54:28.790 align:start position:0%
education in a particular religious
ideology

02:54:28.790 --> 02:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
ideology
 
02:54:30.309 --> 02:54:30.319 align:start position:0%
that that would be
 
02:54:33.590 --> 02:54:33.600 align:start position:0%
a reason for them to leave
 
02:54:35.750 --> 02:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
that should be included
 
02:54:37.670 --> 02:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
and i hope you would agree with me
 
02:54:39.910 --> 02:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
should be included on this survey rather
 
02:54:41.670 --> 02:54:41.680 align:start position:0%
than the fact that
 
02:54:43.750 --> 02:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
they have a grievance or that they're
 
02:54:46.469 --> 02:54:46.479 align:start position:0%
upset or that they are
 
02:54:49.429 --> 02:54:49.439 align:start position:0%
the student the public school is failing
 
02:54:51.030 --> 02:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:54:53.269 --> 02:54:53.279 align:start position:0%
well i'll respond with some
 
02:54:55.269 --> 02:54:55.279 align:start position:0%
some statistics that i saw in an article
 
02:54:56.550 --> 02:54:56.560 align:start position:0%
i actually read last night i believe it
 
02:54:57.670 --> 02:54:57.680 align:start position:0%
was a new hampshire journal that
 
02:54:59.269 --> 02:54:59.279 align:start position:0%
mentioned um or maybe it was josiah
 
02:55:01.830 --> 02:55:01.840 align:start position:0%
bartlett um their their policy research
 
02:55:03.349 --> 02:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
institute were that mentioned that
 
02:55:05.510 --> 02:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
according to ed choice a big reason why
 
02:55:06.790 --> 02:55:06.800 align:start position:0%
a number of students in our state are
 
02:55:08.630 --> 02:55:08.640 align:start position:0%
leaving one of it has to do with covet
 
02:55:10.150 --> 02:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
protocol but another the second biggest
 
02:55:11.990 --> 02:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
reason has to do with curriculum right
 
02:55:14.469 --> 02:55:14.479 align:start position:0%
and feeling as if this students that
 
02:55:16.710 --> 02:55:16.720 align:start position:0%
they're not being taught to their
 
02:55:18.870 --> 02:55:18.880 align:start position:0%
potential and so i think that's a big
 
02:55:21.429 --> 02:55:21.439 align:start position:0%
thing if we have you know i believe
 
02:55:22.550 --> 02:55:22.560 align:start position:0%
you know right now i'm kind of
 
02:55:24.389 --> 02:55:24.399 align:start position:0%
estimating based on i'm going based on
 
02:55:26.309 --> 02:55:26.319 align:start position:0%
memory so please take take with a grain
 
02:55:28.790 --> 02:55:28.800 align:start position:0%
of salt but um if we have about 30
 
02:55:29.990 --> 02:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
percent of students that are leaving
 
02:55:31.830 --> 02:55:31.840 align:start position:0%
because they feel as if they're you know
 
02:55:32.950 --> 02:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
the parents feel as if their students
 
02:55:34.550 --> 02:55:34.560 align:start position:0%
aren't being challenged
 
02:55:36.550 --> 02:55:36.560 align:start position:0%
right i think that's that's a sizable
 
02:55:38.150 --> 02:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
portion of students
 
02:55:40.070 --> 02:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
and you know that the public school
 
02:55:42.230 --> 02:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
system is essentially saying you know
 
02:55:44.870 --> 02:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
what we you know we have no interest in
 
02:55:46.150 --> 02:55:46.160 align:start position:0%
being able to challenge our brightest
 
02:55:47.429 --> 02:55:47.439 align:start position:0%
students so we're going to let some of
 
02:55:48.550 --> 02:55:48.560 align:start position:0%
our brightest students in our best
 
02:55:50.230 --> 02:55:50.240 align:start position:0%
performance on standardized tests and
 
02:55:52.070 --> 02:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
some of our you know students that are
 
02:55:54.230 --> 02:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
going to be going towards a tall college
 
02:55:56.469 --> 02:55:56.479 align:start position:0%
degree we're going to let them leave the
 
02:55:57.750 --> 02:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
public school system because we're not
 
02:55:59.030 --> 02:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
going to address their concerns i think
 
02:56:00.630 --> 02:56:00.640 align:start position:0%
the public school system should you know
 
02:56:01.910 --> 02:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
react and say you know what we want to
 
02:56:03.349 --> 02:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
keep these students we want to improve
 
02:56:05.510 --> 02:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
education we want our curriculum to be
 
02:56:07.429 --> 02:56:07.439 align:start position:0%
you know top notch in the united states
 
02:56:09.349 --> 02:56:09.359 align:start position:0%
and nationally and i think data like
 
02:56:11.190 --> 02:56:11.200 align:start position:0%
this is going to help us really you know
 
02:56:13.190 --> 02:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
understand that and even get feedback
 
02:56:15.030 --> 02:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
for if it's science it's lacking or math
 
02:56:18.469 --> 02:56:18.479 align:start position:0%
or reading or writing etc
 
02:56:21.349 --> 02:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i've got a question
 
02:56:23.110 --> 02:56:23.120 align:start position:0%
we all know that
 
02:56:24.710 --> 02:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
folks and parents are always looking for
 
02:56:26.230 --> 02:56:26.240 align:start position:0%
the best fit for their child be it a
 
02:56:28.630 --> 02:56:28.640 align:start position:0%
charter school homeschooling
 
02:56:30.389 --> 02:56:30.399 align:start position:0%
moving with the parent to somewhere else
 
02:56:31.830 --> 02:56:31.840 align:start position:0%
private schools religious schools et
 
02:56:31.840 --> 02:56:32.870 align:start position:0%
private schools religious schools et
cetera

02:56:32.870 --> 02:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
cetera
 
02:56:32.880 --> 02:56:34.309 align:start position:0%
cetera
efas

02:56:34.309 --> 02:56:34.319 align:start position:0%
efas
 
02:56:36.469 --> 02:56:36.479 align:start position:0%
but i as a parent
 
02:56:38.870 --> 02:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
decide to take my child and place them
 
02:56:40.469 --> 02:56:40.479 align:start position:0%
in an efa
 
02:56:42.230 --> 02:56:42.240 align:start position:0%
do you think i'm going to give you the
 
02:56:45.590 --> 02:56:45.600 align:start position:0%
reason why if i have other students in
 
02:56:47.910 --> 02:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
that same school coming up in the lower
 
02:56:50.950 --> 02:56:50.960 align:start position:0%
grades and fearful of retribution
 
02:56:52.950 --> 02:56:52.960 align:start position:0%
towards those students well i take this
 
02:56:54.389 --> 02:56:54.399 align:start position:0%
out because
 
02:56:56.870 --> 02:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh i don't believe my child would get an
 
02:57:00.230 --> 02:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
adequate education with teacher x
 
02:57:02.150 --> 02:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
well i am i certainly and that's why i
 
02:57:03.590 --> 02:57:03.600 align:start position:0%
think you know it would be wise of the
 
02:57:05.030 --> 02:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
committee to amend it so that it's an
 
02:57:07.349 --> 02:57:07.359 align:start position:0%
anonymous survey um then you do run into
 
02:57:08.630 --> 02:57:08.640 align:start position:0%
the issue of such a small school
 
02:57:10.230 --> 02:57:10.240 align:start position:0%
district and there's only
 
02:57:12.950 --> 02:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
two or one yeah two or one so and i do i
 
02:57:15.990 --> 02:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
do recognize that and um i would i would
 
02:57:17.269 --> 02:57:17.279 align:start position:0%
i would find it difficult of how to
 
02:57:19.349 --> 02:57:19.359 align:start position:0%
reconcile it maybe another amendment
 
02:57:20.870 --> 02:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
would be making it so the information
 
02:57:22.550 --> 02:57:22.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't just go directly to the
 
02:57:23.910 --> 02:57:23.920 align:start position:0%
administrators but it just stays with
 
02:57:25.670 --> 02:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
the department of education for all
 
02:57:26.790 --> 02:57:26.800 align:start position:0%
students in the state of new hampshire
 
02:57:28.230 --> 02:57:28.240 align:start position:0%
be aggregated but then it becomes more
 
02:57:30.870 --> 02:57:30.880 align:start position:0%
difficult to find out how specific
 
02:57:32.630 --> 02:57:32.640 align:start position:0%
school districts might you know have
 
02:57:34.870 --> 02:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
certain failings so i mean this is a you
 
02:57:36.710 --> 02:57:36.720 align:start position:0%
know this is a uh
 
02:57:38.389 --> 02:57:38.399 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't say at this point that this
 
02:57:40.070 --> 02:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
bill is ready for prime time after some
 
02:57:41.269 --> 02:57:41.279 align:start position:0%
of these questions i'll be honest and
 
02:57:43.030 --> 02:57:43.040 align:start position:0%
i'm willing to admit when i've um when
 
02:57:44.070 --> 02:57:44.080 align:start position:0%
i'm wrong
 
02:57:45.670 --> 02:57:45.680 align:start position:0%
but i also think though that it's
 
02:57:47.110 --> 02:57:47.120 align:start position:0%
important that we collect data i know
 
02:57:48.630 --> 02:57:48.640 align:start position:0%
the vice chairman is going to have a
 
02:57:50.790 --> 02:57:50.800 align:start position:0%
good bill that i hope the committee will
 
02:57:52.469 --> 02:57:52.479 align:start position:0%
unanimously support for collecting data
 
02:57:54.389 --> 02:57:54.399 align:start position:0%
from these public school students but i
 
02:57:55.990 --> 02:57:56.000 align:start position:0%
also think it's important to know though
 
02:57:57.670 --> 02:57:57.680 align:start position:0%
when the students are leaving the public
 
02:57:59.670 --> 02:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
education system what the biggest
 
02:58:01.269 --> 02:58:01.279 align:start position:0%
impetus reasons for that are and i hope
 
02:58:02.870 --> 02:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
that we can find a way in the future to
 
02:58:05.590 --> 02:58:05.600 align:start position:0%
really ascertain that
 
02:58:06.790 --> 02:58:06.800 align:start position:0%
okay representative porter then
 
02:58:08.710 --> 02:58:08.720 align:start position:0%
represent leicester thank you mr
 
02:58:10.070 --> 02:58:10.080 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you representative for
 
02:58:12.790 --> 02:58:12.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question um from
 
02:58:14.950 --> 02:58:14.960 align:start position:0%
sources that i've seen
 
02:58:17.910 --> 02:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
this year's efa recipients the vast
 
02:58:19.830 --> 02:58:19.840 align:start position:0%
majority of them were already
 
02:58:22.070 --> 02:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
homeschooled or in private schools do
 
02:58:25.030 --> 02:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
you know what percentage of the efa
 
02:58:25.040 --> 02:58:26.710 align:start position:0%
you know what percentage of the efa
students

02:58:26.710 --> 02:58:26.720 align:start position:0%
students
 
02:58:28.870 --> 02:58:28.880 align:start position:0%
this year are actually leaving their
 
02:58:31.030 --> 02:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
public schools
 
02:58:33.030 --> 02:58:33.040 align:start position:0%
i don't have that information i'm sorry
 
02:58:35.510 --> 02:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
representative no guest with the
 
02:58:35.520 --> 02:58:37.030 align:start position:0%
representative no guest with the
number

02:58:37.030 --> 02:58:37.040 align:start position:0%
number
 
02:58:38.230 --> 02:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to make i'm not going to
 
02:58:40.070 --> 02:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
make an educated guess
 
02:58:42.550 --> 02:58:42.560 align:start position:0%
i just really have no idea
 
02:58:43.510 --> 02:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:58:45.030 --> 02:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
the department does have that
 
02:58:45.040 --> 02:58:50.150 align:start position:0%
the department does have that
information

02:58:50.150 --> 02:58:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:51.910 --> 02:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
representative coming across the way
 
02:58:54.389 --> 02:58:54.399 align:start position:0%
represent like us
 
02:58:57.510 --> 02:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
would you be amenable to this being a
 
02:59:00.070 --> 02:59:00.080 align:start position:0%
voluntary survey so that those parents
 
02:59:02.710 --> 02:59:02.720 align:start position:0%
who do fear retribution
 
02:59:05.349 --> 02:59:05.359 align:start position:0%
will not be held up from
 
02:59:06.630 --> 02:59:06.640 align:start position:0%
joining this
 
02:59:08.469 --> 02:59:08.479 align:start position:0%
i think i think that'd be more than fair
 
02:59:09.750 --> 02:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
i still think that there's a number of
 
02:59:11.030 --> 02:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
other things though that might need to
 
02:59:13.429 --> 02:59:13.439 align:start position:0%
be worked out but voluntary making it
 
02:59:15.190 --> 02:59:15.200 align:start position:0%
anonymous i think those are good steps
 
02:59:17.269 --> 02:59:17.279 align:start position:0%
in the right direction certainly
 
02:59:18.309 --> 02:59:18.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:59:20.309 --> 02:59:20.319 align:start position:0%
representative ellison thank you mr
 
02:59:22.630 --> 02:59:22.640 align:start position:0%
chair thanks for taking my question
 
02:59:24.309 --> 02:59:24.319 align:start position:0%
uh are you aware that
 
02:59:26.710 --> 02:59:26.720 align:start position:0%
at this point in time 87 percent of the
 
02:59:28.389 --> 02:59:28.399 align:start position:0%
students who were in school
 
02:59:30.870 --> 02:59:30.880 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and public schools i i
 
02:59:33.269 --> 02:59:33.279 align:start position:0%
was not aware but um if that's that's a
 
02:59:35.190 --> 02:59:35.200 align:start position:0%
current figure then i would believe it
 
02:59:38.790 --> 02:59:38.800 align:start position:0%
thank you representative woodcock
 
02:59:40.630 --> 02:59:40.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um probably the
 
02:59:42.469 --> 02:59:42.479 align:start position:0%
shay that i appreciate you coming
 
02:59:44.550 --> 02:59:44.560 align:start position:0%
forward with this i didn't i was not
 
02:59:46.150 --> 02:59:46.160 align:start position:0%
able to discern what dui was actually
 
02:59:47.190 --> 02:59:47.200 align:start position:0%
going to do with the data because it's
 
02:59:48.550 --> 02:59:48.560 align:start position:0%
not outlined
 
02:59:49.910 --> 02:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
but um
 
02:59:52.230 --> 02:59:52.240 align:start position:0%
that's a different than my point
 
02:59:54.790 --> 02:59:54.800 align:start position:0%
i take i take exception
 
02:59:56.950 --> 02:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
to your comment
 
02:59:59.510 --> 02:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
as a public school employee for a long
 
03:00:02.469 --> 03:00:02.479 align:start position:0%
time and a teacher
 
03:00:04.790 --> 03:00:04.800 align:start position:0%
that you made the comment and i quote
 
03:00:07.190 --> 03:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
referring to public schools we have no
 
03:00:09.190 --> 03:00:09.200 align:start position:0%
interest in challenging our brightest
 
03:00:11.429 --> 03:00:11.439 align:start position:0%
students that's what you said
 
03:00:13.590 --> 03:00:13.600 align:start position:0%
and i think that is a total disregard
 
03:00:15.429 --> 03:00:15.439 align:start position:0%
for the the
 
03:00:17.429 --> 03:00:17.439 align:start position:0%
public school teachers
 
03:00:19.429 --> 03:00:19.439 align:start position:0%
and administrators because they
 
03:00:21.830 --> 03:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
challenge their students every single
 
03:00:21.840 --> 03:00:22.630 align:start position:0%
challenge their students every single
day

03:00:22.630 --> 03:00:22.640 align:start position:0%
day
 
03:00:24.389 --> 03:00:24.399 align:start position:0%
and to make that blanket statement i
 
03:00:26.389 --> 03:00:26.399 align:start position:0%
think it's i think it's um
 
03:00:28.150 --> 03:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
at least upsetting to me
 
03:00:29.990 --> 03:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you all right be nice to have a
 
03:00:32.230 --> 03:00:32.240 align:start position:0%
question you could would you believe and
 
03:00:35.110 --> 03:00:35.120 align:start position:0%
would you believe you said that um
 
03:00:36.710 --> 03:00:36.720 align:start position:0%
i'll have to i'll have to rewatch the
 
03:00:37.910 --> 03:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
youtube recording later but i don't
 
03:00:39.349 --> 03:00:39.359 align:start position:0%
think that might have been entirely my
 
03:00:41.510 --> 03:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
direct quote but i was more speaking to
 
03:00:43.990 --> 03:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
how people are perceiving it
 
03:00:44.000 --> 03:00:45.190 align:start position:0%
how people are perceiving it
now

03:00:45.190 --> 03:00:45.200 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:00:46.550 --> 03:00:46.560 align:start position:0%
i think there are people who might have
 
03:00:48.389 --> 03:00:48.399 align:start position:0%
that perception whether or not it's true
 
03:00:50.389 --> 03:00:50.399 align:start position:0%
that's a different story but if people
 
03:00:51.990 --> 03:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
have that perception i think it's
 
03:00:53.269 --> 03:00:53.279 align:start position:0%
important for us to address it or at
 
03:00:54.550 --> 03:00:54.560 align:start position:0%
least to prove
 
03:00:56.469 --> 03:00:56.479 align:start position:0%
that you know that that
 
03:00:58.389 --> 03:00:58.399 align:start position:0%
perception might be misguided and that
 
03:01:00.790 --> 03:01:00.800 align:start position:0%
public schools and public administrators
 
03:01:02.950 --> 03:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
and teachers are working their hardest
 
03:01:06.150 --> 03:01:06.160 align:start position:0%
to um to to meet um the needs of
 
03:01:08.309 --> 03:01:08.319 align:start position:0%
students every student's need
 
03:01:10.790 --> 03:01:10.800 align:start position:0%
we have a couple more cards are there
 
03:01:12.710 --> 03:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
any more questions here
 
03:01:13.990 --> 03:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
from the committee for our
 
03:01:14.000 --> 03:01:15.429 align:start position:0%
from the committee for our
representative

03:01:15.429 --> 03:01:15.439 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:01:21.349 --> 03:01:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:33.269 --> 03:01:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:35.269 --> 03:01:35.279 align:start position:0%
you indicate that you're able to provide
 
03:01:37.110 --> 03:01:37.120 align:start position:0%
technical support
 
03:01:39.190 --> 03:01:39.200 align:start position:0%
do you have any testimony that you just
 
03:01:51.110 --> 03:01:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:52.950 --> 03:01:52.960 align:start position:0%
um okay so
 
03:01:54.550 --> 03:01:54.560 align:start position:0%
there's a couple issues that i just
 
03:01:57.110 --> 03:01:57.120 align:start position:0%
thought would add to uh
 
03:01:58.710 --> 03:01:58.720 align:start position:0%
matt why don't you give the organization
 
03:02:00.950 --> 03:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry yeah matt southerton from
 
03:02:03.030 --> 03:02:03.040 align:start position:0%
children's scholarship fund
 
03:02:04.710 --> 03:02:04.720 align:start position:0%
there's a couple issues that i think
 
03:02:06.630 --> 03:02:06.640 align:start position:0%
that the committee would
 
03:02:08.870 --> 03:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate knowing we currently collect
 
03:02:11.349 --> 03:02:11.359 align:start position:0%
this data for the education tax credit
 
03:02:13.349 --> 03:02:13.359 align:start position:0%
that data is available publicly to
 
03:02:13.359 --> 03:02:14.389 align:start position:0%
that data is available publicly to
everyone

03:02:14.389 --> 03:02:14.399 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
03:02:17.110 --> 03:02:17.120 align:start position:0%
of course it's non-identifiable data
 
03:02:17.120 --> 03:02:18.469 align:start position:0%
of course it's non-identifiable data
so

03:02:18.469 --> 03:02:18.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:02:19.429 --> 03:02:19.439 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:02:20.550 --> 03:02:20.560 align:start position:0%
you won't be able to look up the
 
03:02:22.309 --> 03:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
student's name and
 
03:02:23.910 --> 03:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
and so that
 
03:02:25.349 --> 03:02:25.359 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't be able to retaliate
 
03:02:27.590 --> 03:02:27.600 align:start position:0%
against the students one issue with this
 
03:02:30.309 --> 03:02:30.319 align:start position:0%
current language is it it's actually as
 
03:02:32.070 --> 03:02:32.080 align:start position:0%
it's written it's a condition of
 
03:02:34.230 --> 03:02:34.240 align:start position:0%
enrollment that
 
03:02:36.630 --> 03:02:36.640 align:start position:0%
we think could be an issue because
 
03:02:39.429 --> 03:02:39.439 align:start position:0%
currently students can apply for the efa
 
03:02:42.309 --> 03:02:42.319 align:start position:0%
and they may or may not accept it right
 
03:02:43.670 --> 03:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
so when we
 
03:02:45.030 --> 03:02:45.040 align:start position:0%
when we
 
03:02:48.550 --> 03:02:48.560 align:start position:0%
um share the survey with families
 
03:02:50.389 --> 03:02:50.399 align:start position:0%
first it's not conditional of acceptance
 
03:02:50.399 --> 03:02:51.190 align:start position:0%
first it's not conditional of acceptance
right

03:02:51.190 --> 03:02:51.200 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:02:53.590 --> 03:02:53.600 align:start position:0%
and then secondly they can decide that
 
03:02:56.230 --> 03:02:56.240 align:start position:0%
they want to fill it out or not
 
03:02:56.240 --> 03:02:57.510 align:start position:0%
they want to fill it out or not
um

03:02:57.510 --> 03:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:02:57.520 --> 03:02:58.870 align:start position:0%
um
and

03:02:58.870 --> 03:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:02:58.880 --> 03:03:00.630 align:start position:0%
and
so

03:03:00.630 --> 03:03:00.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:03:00.640 --> 03:03:01.670 align:start position:0%
so
currently

03:03:01.670 --> 03:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
currently
 
03:03:04.550 --> 03:03:04.560 align:start position:0%
if i looked at the 6 221 survey i found
 
03:03:07.510 --> 03:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
it interesting 49 of the respondents
 
03:03:10.150 --> 03:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
uh they just responded as other and then
 
03:03:11.830 --> 03:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
they put in
 
03:03:14.230 --> 03:03:14.240 align:start position:0%
individual responses
 
03:03:17.269 --> 03:03:17.279 align:start position:0%
43 of them said that they chose the etc
 
03:03:18.710 --> 03:03:18.720 align:start position:0%
because their student was below grade
 
03:03:18.720 --> 03:03:19.510 align:start position:0%
because their student was below grade
level

03:03:19.510 --> 03:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
level
 
03:03:22.230 --> 03:03:22.240 align:start position:0%
11 and a half because of safety and nine
 
03:03:23.510 --> 03:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
a little over nine percent because of
 
03:03:24.830 --> 03:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
special days
 
03:03:24.840 --> 03:03:26.469 align:start position:0%
special days
so

03:03:26.469 --> 03:03:26.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:03:27.750 --> 03:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
i don't think they're choosing it
 
03:03:30.070 --> 03:03:30.080 align:start position:0%
because you know they had a an issue
 
03:03:31.990 --> 03:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
with the public school per se i think
 
03:03:33.269 --> 03:03:33.279 align:start position:0%
that they just wanted options that
 
03:03:35.269 --> 03:03:35.279 align:start position:0%
better fit their student
 
03:03:37.190 --> 03:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
that was my takeaway and again this is
 
03:03:38.830 --> 03:03:38.840 align:start position:0%
all available
 
03:03:41.269 --> 03:03:41.279 align:start position:0%
publicly are there any questions for
 
03:03:42.870 --> 03:03:42.880 align:start position:0%
matt southerton
 
03:03:44.790 --> 03:03:44.800 align:start position:0%
yes represent luna
 
03:03:46.389 --> 03:03:46.399 align:start position:0%
thanks very much mr chair thanks very
 
03:03:48.710 --> 03:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
much for uh for being with us um uh this
 
03:03:51.349 --> 03:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
morning um and uh you may have said it
 
03:03:54.550 --> 03:03:54.560 align:start position:0%
and maybe i missed it but in that survey
 
03:03:56.790 --> 03:03:56.800 align:start position:0%
were those open-ended questions or were
 
03:03:59.349 --> 03:03:59.359 align:start position:0%
those options that were given uh
 
03:03:59.359 --> 03:04:00.389 align:start position:0%
those options that were given uh
the

03:04:00.389 --> 03:04:00.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:04:02.150 --> 03:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
there were categories and then there was
 
03:04:04.630 --> 03:04:04.640 align:start position:0%
an open-ended the other was open-ended
 
03:04:06.469 --> 03:04:06.479 align:start position:0%
and that was 49
 
03:04:09.670 --> 03:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
49 was correct so they could yes correct
 
03:04:13.030 --> 03:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
so so of the 40 of of that 49
 
03:04:14.630 --> 03:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
could be
 
03:04:17.990 --> 03:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
um and this is a question so paul um
 
03:04:20.070 --> 03:04:20.080 align:start position:0%
could be family tradition to attend a
 
03:04:22.389 --> 03:04:22.399 align:start position:0%
private school it could be family
 
03:04:24.070 --> 03:04:24.080 align:start position:0%
tradition to be home schooled it could
 
03:04:26.950 --> 03:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
be change of school because of athletic
 
03:04:26.960 --> 03:04:28.469 align:start position:0%
be change of school because of athletic
opportunities

03:04:28.469 --> 03:04:28.479 align:start position:0%
opportunities
 
03:04:30.070 --> 03:04:30.080 align:start position:0%
um you know sports programs not
 
03:04:31.830 --> 03:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
available in my local school stuff so
 
03:04:33.349 --> 03:04:33.359 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at one now financial
 
03:04:35.830 --> 03:04:35.840 align:start position:0%
assistance family of six low-income
 
03:04:39.110 --> 03:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
sister was already homeschooling so
 
03:04:40.870 --> 03:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
name omitted joined in with
 
03:04:42.790 --> 03:04:42.800 align:start position:0%
homeschooling routine
 
03:04:45.030 --> 03:04:45.040 align:start position:0%
our family was assigned the public
 
03:04:47.590 --> 03:04:47.600 align:start position:0%
school did not work for my child
 
03:04:49.510 --> 03:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh and you know it goes okay and then
 
03:04:51.910 --> 03:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
final final question are we going to
 
03:04:53.590 --> 03:04:53.600 align:start position:0%
fight is this committee going to find
 
03:04:56.550 --> 03:04:56.560 align:start position:0%
out um um and hopefully sooner rather
 
03:04:57.670 --> 03:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
than later
 
03:04:59.429 --> 03:04:59.439 align:start position:0%
uh of the
 
03:05:00.870 --> 03:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
and i'm looking at the commissioner's
 
03:05:03.110 --> 03:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
report of the
 
03:05:05.030 --> 03:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
of the
 
03:05:06.710 --> 03:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
to do
 
03:05:08.389 --> 03:05:08.399 align:start position:0%
where's the number
 
03:05:10.710 --> 03:05:10.720 align:start position:0%
i seem to remember it was like
 
03:05:12.230 --> 03:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
sixteen hundred
 
03:05:13.910 --> 03:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
fifty students approximately i think
 
03:05:18.389 --> 03:05:18.399 align:start position:0%
it's 16.85 yes of the 1685 students how
 
03:05:21.349 --> 03:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
many students were in
 
03:05:23.750 --> 03:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
their a public school
 
03:05:25.910 --> 03:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
during the prior year okay a public
 
03:05:28.070 --> 03:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
charter school which public school i'd
 
03:05:30.469 --> 03:05:30.479 align:start position:0%
call that a public school if you want
 
03:05:33.110 --> 03:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
the prior year home schooled uh the
 
03:05:35.590 --> 03:05:35.600 align:start position:0%
prior year or in a private or a
 
03:05:38.070 --> 03:05:38.080 align:start position:0%
non-public school during the uh during
 
03:05:40.469 --> 03:05:40.479 align:start position:0%
the prior year because the um
 
03:05:42.230 --> 03:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
the commissioner's
 
03:05:42.240 --> 03:05:43.349 align:start position:0%
the commissioner's
report

03:05:43.349 --> 03:05:43.359 align:start position:0%
report
 
03:05:45.750 --> 03:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
indicates that um the expectation was
 
03:05:48.389 --> 03:05:48.399 align:start position:0%
that 75 percent were going to be coming
 
03:05:50.870 --> 03:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
from directly from
 
03:05:53.429 --> 03:05:53.439 align:start position:0%
uh from their public school but at least
 
03:05:55.110 --> 03:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
based on the commissioner's data it
 
03:05:57.590 --> 03:05:57.600 align:start position:0%
looks that only 3.6 percent came from
 
03:05:59.110 --> 03:05:59.120 align:start position:0%
their public school i think this goes to
 
03:06:01.429 --> 03:06:01.439 align:start position:0%
an earlier question so i think we'd be
 
03:06:03.190 --> 03:06:03.200 align:start position:0%
very this okay committee would be very
 
03:06:04.630 --> 03:06:04.640 align:start position:0%
interesting yeah i believe we can pull
 
03:06:10.309 --> 03:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:10.319 --> 03:06:11.190 align:start position:0%
 
uh

03:06:11.190 --> 03:06:11.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:06:11.200 --> 03:06:12.830 align:start position:0%
uh
representative

03:06:12.830 --> 03:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:06:15.910 --> 03:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
mullen thank you mr chair thank you matt
 
03:06:17.590 --> 03:06:17.600 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
03:06:21.349 --> 03:06:21.359 align:start position:0%
uh if you peruse the other list
 
03:06:25.990 --> 03:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
do you get a sense that uh giftedness or
 
03:06:28.790 --> 03:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
a lack of challenge or whatever is on
 
03:06:30.630 --> 03:06:30.640 align:start position:0%
that list to any
 
03:06:32.550 --> 03:06:32.560 align:start position:0%
large degree
 
03:06:34.230 --> 03:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
and i asked that question based on the
 
03:06:36.070 --> 03:06:36.080 align:start position:0%
fact that we've sat here for years
 
03:06:38.790 --> 03:06:38.800 align:start position:0%
talking now about uh
 
03:06:41.349 --> 03:06:41.359 align:start position:0%
the reasons why a student might lead
 
03:06:43.110 --> 03:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
leave public school but this is one of
 
03:06:46.070 --> 03:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
the first times that i've heard
 
03:06:48.469 --> 03:06:48.479 align:start position:0%
giftedness or a lack of challenge or
 
03:06:50.469 --> 03:06:50.479 align:start position:0%
whatever thank you
 
03:06:52.389 --> 03:06:52.399 align:start position:0%
i think that i would i would be
 
03:06:55.670 --> 03:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
speculating i see 268 responses
 
03:06:57.590 --> 03:06:57.600 align:start position:0%
currently and i i don't know if you'd
 
03:06:59.190 --> 03:06:59.200 align:start position:0%
want me to review them all in front of
 
03:07:00.630 --> 03:07:00.640 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
03:07:00.640 --> 03:07:01.590 align:start position:0%
the committee
um

03:07:01.590 --> 03:07:01.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:04.150 --> 03:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
to financially help me afford to send my
 
03:07:06.469 --> 03:07:06.479 align:start position:0%
child to the school that they love
 
03:07:08.070 --> 03:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
siblings changed school we were not
 
03:07:09.910 --> 03:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
comfortable at their that their previous
 
03:07:09.920 --> 03:07:11.269 align:start position:0%
comfortable at their that their previous
school

03:07:11.269 --> 03:07:11.279 align:start position:0%
school
 
03:07:11.279 --> 03:07:12.150 align:start position:0%
school
uh

03:07:12.150 --> 03:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:07:13.990 --> 03:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
let's see this was two years ago when we
 
03:07:17.190 --> 03:07:17.200 align:start position:0%
made the decision to switch to school
 
03:07:18.950 --> 03:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
i wanted to be able to choose the school
 
03:07:20.710 --> 03:07:20.720 align:start position:0%
that my child would attend
 
03:07:22.950 --> 03:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
so i think it's it's really about choice
 
03:07:27.030 --> 03:07:27.040 align:start position:0%
and a lot of it is a financial need
 
03:07:31.429 --> 03:07:31.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:34.150 --> 03:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
would it be possible to also find out
 
03:07:37.030 --> 03:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
how many of those students who chose
 
03:07:39.910 --> 03:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
efas were at some point
 
03:07:42.309 --> 03:07:42.319 align:start position:0%
enrolled in public schools
 
03:07:45.670 --> 03:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
because my understanding is
 
03:07:49.110 --> 03:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
the year before was a big exodus
 
03:07:52.870 --> 03:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
based on schools not being open and that
 
03:07:54.630 --> 03:07:54.640 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you know that wouldn't show up
 
03:07:57.190 --> 03:07:57.200 align:start position:0%
in these numbers in these questions
 
03:08:00.309 --> 03:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
and then others i believe pulled out
 
03:08:02.790 --> 03:08:02.800 align:start position:0%
prior to that and were just trying to
 
03:08:05.110 --> 03:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
make do and that's why they were
 
03:08:06.790 --> 03:08:06.800 align:start position:0%
homeschooled because public school
 
03:08:08.230 --> 03:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
wasn't working
 
03:08:08.240 --> 03:08:09.269 align:start position:0%
wasn't working
and

03:08:09.269 --> 03:08:09.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:08:11.030 --> 03:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you even have those but
 
03:08:13.990 --> 03:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
if so could you find that out i believe
 
03:08:16.230 --> 03:08:16.240 align:start position:0%
we do so when i was looking at the data
 
03:08:18.070 --> 03:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
approximately half of the students in
 
03:08:20.630 --> 03:08:20.640 align:start position:0%
the program currently uh have attended a
 
03:08:22.550 --> 03:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
pri uh have attended a public a
 
03:08:24.550 --> 03:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
traditional public school before
 
03:08:26.389 --> 03:08:26.399 align:start position:0%
um but i think we can pull those numbers
 
03:08:27.990 --> 03:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
forward thank you very much sure are
 
03:08:30.710 --> 03:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
there any other questions for our
 
03:08:30.720 --> 03:08:31.670 align:start position:0%
there any other questions for our
matt

03:08:31.670 --> 03:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
matt
 
03:08:35.510 --> 03:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
not seeing any hands thank you very much
 
03:08:38.550 --> 03:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
and kathleen
 
03:08:43.429 --> 03:08:43.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:45.349 --> 03:08:45.359 align:start position:0%
your handwriting changes from one card
 
03:08:52.469 --> 03:08:52.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:55.830 --> 03:08:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:59.750 --> 03:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
okay hello kathleen cintavi from dover
 
03:09:01.429 --> 03:09:01.439 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
03:09:04.870 --> 03:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
in reading this bill there are
 
03:09:06.950 --> 03:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
the word shall
 
03:09:09.349 --> 03:09:09.359 align:start position:0%
shows up in line four
 
03:09:11.990 --> 03:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
five and seven
 
03:09:15.269 --> 03:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
shall is a very strong word that means
 
03:09:18.230 --> 03:09:18.240 align:start position:0%
that it becomes a requirement
 
03:09:18.240 --> 03:09:19.190 align:start position:0%
that it becomes a requirement
and

03:09:19.190 --> 03:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:09:22.150 --> 03:09:22.160 align:start position:0%
i do oppose the fact that this would
 
03:09:24.309 --> 03:09:24.319 align:start position:0%
become a requirement
 
03:09:24.319 --> 03:09:25.349 align:start position:0%
become a requirement
however

03:09:25.349 --> 03:09:25.359 align:start position:0%
however
 
03:09:29.110 --> 03:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
data is extremely important and i can
 
03:09:31.349 --> 03:09:31.359 align:start position:0%
tell you just speaking about dover
 
03:09:35.030 --> 03:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
schools during covid when it was online
 
03:09:37.830 --> 03:09:37.840 align:start position:0%
parents were told not
 
03:09:40.550 --> 03:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
to be in the room with their children by
 
03:09:43.830 --> 03:09:43.840 align:start position:0%
the teachers this is reported to me by
 
03:09:45.590 --> 03:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
numerous parents
 
03:09:48.389 --> 03:09:48.399 align:start position:0%
they did not want them in the room but
 
03:09:51.030 --> 03:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
parents stayed in the room they became
 
03:09:53.349 --> 03:09:53.359 align:start position:0%
extremely unhappy
 
03:09:56.630 --> 03:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
with the crt that was being taught
 
03:10:00.070 --> 03:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
and the fact that pace was very much
 
03:10:01.750 --> 03:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
slowed down
 
03:10:03.990 --> 03:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
and i can tell you on my street there
 
03:10:06.630 --> 03:10:06.640 align:start position:0%
are seven children four of them now go
 
03:10:08.790 --> 03:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
to private school
 
03:10:11.510 --> 03:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
as a result of that
 
03:10:13.269 --> 03:10:13.279 align:start position:0%
and i
 
03:10:16.309 --> 03:10:16.319 align:start position:0%
did go through the elementary buildings
 
03:10:16.319 --> 03:10:17.190 align:start position:0%
did go through the elementary buildings
and

03:10:17.190 --> 03:10:17.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:10:19.750 --> 03:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
each principal we have three
 
03:10:22.870 --> 03:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
has a decline of about 100 students per
 
03:10:22.880 --> 03:10:24.150 align:start position:0%
has a decline of about 100 students per
building

03:10:24.150 --> 03:10:24.160 align:start position:0%
building
 
03:10:26.630 --> 03:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
so that is when you have 400 students
 
03:10:29.670 --> 03:10:29.680 align:start position:0%
that is a big decline in children going
 
03:10:29.680 --> 03:10:30.950 align:start position:0%
that is a big decline in children going
elsewhere

03:10:30.950 --> 03:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
elsewhere
 
03:10:33.269 --> 03:10:33.279 align:start position:0%
there's private christian academy that
 
03:10:35.349 --> 03:10:35.359 align:start position:0%
is filled up to the gills
 
03:10:37.750 --> 03:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
the local catholic school is filled up
 
03:10:39.750 --> 03:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
they were driving their people their
 
03:10:43.030 --> 03:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
children down to portsmouth so there
 
03:10:45.110 --> 03:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
there are a number of things that we
 
03:10:47.990 --> 03:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
need to start examining i believe in our
 
03:10:50.790 --> 03:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
public schools so to me
 
03:10:52.309 --> 03:10:52.319 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
03:10:55.830 --> 03:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
the idea of an anonymous survey that is
 
03:10:57.990 --> 03:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
given to each and every student
 
03:11:00.790 --> 03:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
regardless of the reason why they are
 
03:11:02.950 --> 03:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
leaving should be done
 
03:11:04.790 --> 03:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
even in the middle of the year whenever
 
03:11:06.790 --> 03:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
it is that a child is leaving whether
 
03:11:08.630 --> 03:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
it's for moving
 
03:11:11.429 --> 03:11:11.439 align:start position:0%
or for they're going to religious school
 
03:11:13.990 --> 03:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
or private school home schooling
 
03:11:16.150 --> 03:11:16.160 align:start position:0%
we need to know
 
03:11:18.790 --> 03:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
what is going on in our schools and i
 
03:11:21.110 --> 03:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
can tell you speaking from dover's
 
03:11:23.750 --> 03:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
perspective parents are not welcome in
 
03:11:26.469 --> 03:11:26.479 align:start position:0%
the building and they want to know what
 
03:11:29.429 --> 03:11:29.439 align:start position:0%
is going on they had a glimpse into it
 
03:11:32.790 --> 03:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
during covid and they were not
 
03:11:32.800 --> 03:11:33.830 align:start position:0%
during covid and they were not
happy

03:11:33.830 --> 03:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
happy
 
03:11:35.990 --> 03:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
so we have to be careful when we're
 
03:11:39.349 --> 03:11:39.359 align:start position:0%
doing a survey to make sure that it is
 
03:11:42.389 --> 03:11:42.399 align:start position:0%
not seen as targeting and the number of
 
03:11:44.309 --> 03:11:44.319 align:start position:0%
parents who spoke with me
 
03:11:46.630 --> 03:11:46.640 align:start position:0%
said please don't ever
 
03:11:50.229 --> 03:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
reveal who i am because i'm afraid of
 
03:11:50.239 --> 03:11:51.830 align:start position:0%
reveal who i am because i'm afraid of
repercussions

03:11:51.830 --> 03:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
repercussions
 
03:11:54.630 --> 03:11:54.640 align:start position:0%
for my child so we have to be very
 
03:11:58.070 --> 03:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
careful and dread tread cautiously but i
 
03:12:00.710 --> 03:12:00.720 align:start position:0%
do believe that in some form
 
03:12:03.269 --> 03:12:03.279 align:start position:0%
we need information
 
03:12:06.070 --> 03:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
otherwise how are we going to turn
 
03:12:08.790 --> 03:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
things around
 
03:12:10.229 --> 03:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
03:12:11.830 --> 03:12:11.840 align:start position:0%

thank you good afternoon chair and my
 
03:56:09.199 --> 03:56:11.030 align:start position:0%
thank you good afternoon chair and my
committee

03:56:11.030 --> 03:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:56:12.189 --> 03:56:12.199 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
03:56:12.199 --> 03:56:13.990 align:start position:0%
house bill
1115

03:56:13.990 --> 03:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
1115
 
03:56:15.910 --> 03:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
relative to the record of educational
 
03:56:17.670 --> 03:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
attendant under the educational freedom
 
03:56:19.750 --> 03:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
account program
 
03:56:22.070 --> 03:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
the intent of this bill is actually
 
03:56:24.790 --> 03:56:24.800 align:start position:0%
accountability and transparency
 
03:56:27.269 --> 03:56:27.279 align:start position:0%
it requires students who participate in
 
03:56:29.910 --> 03:56:29.920 align:start position:0%
the education freedom accounts to take
 
03:56:32.229 --> 03:56:32.239 align:start position:0%
the annual statewide
 
03:56:32.239 --> 03:56:33.429 align:start position:0%
the annual statewide
assessment

03:56:33.429 --> 03:56:33.439 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
03:56:34.870 --> 03:56:34.880 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:56:36.950 --> 03:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
addresses concerns that we heard during
 
03:56:39.349 --> 03:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
the public hearings for this program
 
03:56:42.389 --> 03:56:42.399 align:start position:0%
regarding academic accountability
 
03:56:44.630 --> 03:56:44.640 align:start position:0%
it fall makes sure that we follow the
 
03:56:47.429 --> 03:56:47.439 align:start position:0%
basic rules of public funds our public
 
03:56:49.349 --> 03:56:49.359 align:start position:0%
and charter school students take the
 
03:56:52.070 --> 03:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
statewide assessment and because efa
 
03:56:54.550 --> 03:56:54.560 align:start position:0%
students receive public funds it's only
 
03:56:56.150 --> 03:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
fair that they're held to the same
 
03:56:59.550 --> 03:56:59.560 align:start position:0%
academic accountability requirements
 
03:57:02.389 --> 03:57:02.399 align:start position:0%
hbill1115 does not require any minimum
 
03:57:04.710 --> 03:57:04.720 align:start position:0%
score or performance to continue
 
03:57:07.590 --> 03:57:07.600 align:start position:0%
participating in the program it's just
 
03:57:09.590 --> 03:57:09.600 align:start position:0%
to help see if
 
03:57:12.150 --> 03:57:12.160 align:start position:0%
students are doing equally as well
 
03:57:12.160 --> 03:57:13.189 align:start position:0%
students are doing equally as well
better

03:57:13.189 --> 03:57:13.199 align:start position:0%
better
 
03:57:16.790 --> 03:57:16.800 align:start position:0%
whatever in the um private or
 
03:57:18.550 --> 03:57:18.560 align:start position:0%
religious schools where they are using
 
03:57:24.150 --> 03:57:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:26.150 --> 03:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome are there any
 
03:57:28.389 --> 03:57:28.399 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
03:57:31.349 --> 03:57:31.359 align:start position:0%
representative lakas
 
03:57:34.870 --> 03:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
yes many times you have said to us that
 
03:57:38.150 --> 03:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
this one exam is not a good assessment
 
03:57:40.229 --> 03:57:40.239 align:start position:0%
and we really need broader assessments
 
03:57:40.239 --> 03:57:41.750 align:start position:0%
and we really need broader assessments
etc

03:57:41.750 --> 03:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
etc
 
03:57:43.830 --> 03:57:43.840 align:start position:0%
which is why these three different
 
03:57:46.389 --> 03:57:46.399 align:start position:0%
assessments were put in there and you
 
03:57:49.349 --> 03:57:49.359 align:start position:0%
can still see progress my concern comes
 
03:57:51.110 --> 03:57:51.120 align:start position:0%
i know that
 
03:57:53.510 --> 03:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
a number of the students in the efa
 
03:57:56.469 --> 03:57:56.479 align:start position:0%
program are special needs students
 
03:57:59.750 --> 03:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:03.110 --> 03:58:03.120 align:start position:0%
some of these a portfolio is a much
 
03:58:03.120 --> 03:58:04.150 align:start position:0%
some of these a portfolio is a much
better

03:58:04.150 --> 03:58:04.160 align:start position:0%
better
 
03:58:05.510 --> 03:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
way of
 
03:58:07.830 --> 03:58:07.840 align:start position:0%
seeing progress than the standardized
 
03:58:09.670 --> 03:58:09.680 align:start position:0%
test and some of them probably have
 
03:58:09.680 --> 03:58:11.910 align:start position:0%
test and some of them probably have
difficulties

03:58:11.910 --> 03:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
difficulties
 
03:58:14.150 --> 03:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
with that test
 
03:58:15.750 --> 03:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i think the
 
03:58:17.830 --> 03:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
same accommodations would be made for
 
03:58:21.429 --> 03:58:21.439 align:start position:0%
students getting the efas in private
 
03:58:22.950 --> 03:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
schools that are made for the students
 
03:58:24.469 --> 03:58:24.479 align:start position:0%
that are taking those tests in the
 
03:58:28.229 --> 03:58:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:30.950 --> 03:58:30.960 align:start position:0%
but what about home school students they
 
03:58:33.670 --> 03:58:33.680 align:start position:0%
don't have an iep or any of that kind of
 
03:58:33.680 --> 03:58:34.870 align:start position:0%
don't have an iep or any of that kind of
stuff

03:58:34.870 --> 03:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
03:58:34.880 --> 03:58:36.229 align:start position:0%
stuff
um

03:58:36.229 --> 03:58:36.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:39.590 --> 03:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
and that's and and the portfolio has to
 
03:58:43.830 --> 03:58:43.840 align:start position:0%
be looked at by a certified teacher
 
03:58:45.510 --> 03:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
or a teacher currently teaching in a
 
03:58:47.349 --> 03:58:47.359 align:start position:0%
non-public school
 
03:58:49.030 --> 03:58:49.040 align:start position:0%
so they're still getting
 
03:58:51.670 --> 03:58:51.680 align:start position:0%
and they're still getting an assessment
 
03:58:51.680 --> 03:58:52.710 align:start position:0%
and they're still getting an assessment
done

03:58:52.710 --> 03:58:52.720 align:start position:0%
done
 
03:58:55.030 --> 03:58:55.040 align:start position:0%
but that way
 
03:58:57.189 --> 03:58:57.199 align:start position:0%
the parent can choose the assessment
 
03:59:00.229 --> 03:59:00.239 align:start position:0%
that makes the most sense and for some
 
03:59:02.150 --> 03:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
kids the other i mean
 
03:59:03.990 --> 03:59:04.000 align:start position:0%
when my son for the
 
03:59:05.830 --> 03:59:05.840 align:start position:0%
my youngest son was homeschooled and i
 
03:59:07.590 --> 03:59:07.600 align:start position:0%
did the statewide assessment because it
 
03:59:09.429 --> 03:59:09.439 align:start position:0%
was cheap easy and quick
 
03:59:11.910 --> 03:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
and i knew how he was doing and so i you
 
03:59:14.630 --> 03:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
know i assessed him all the time
 
03:59:19.750 --> 03:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:21.750 --> 03:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
some of the kids who do have some
 
03:59:24.389 --> 03:59:24.399 align:start position:0%
serious learning disabilities
 
03:59:27.110 --> 03:59:27.120 align:start position:0%
that would be not the best
 
03:59:27.120 --> 03:59:30.229 align:start position:0%
that would be not the best
assessment

03:59:30.229 --> 03:59:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:32.550 --> 03:59:32.560 align:start position:0%
is that a question
 
03:59:40.070 --> 03:59:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:42.710 --> 03:59:42.720 align:start position:0%
all students in all public and charter
 
03:59:45.990 --> 03:59:46.000 align:start position:0%
schools take this test so i think to be
 
03:59:49.030 --> 03:59:49.040 align:start position:0%
equal accor across the board measuring
 
03:59:49.040 --> 03:59:50.309 align:start position:0%
equal accor across the board measuring
achievement

03:59:50.309 --> 03:59:50.319 align:start position:0%
achievement
 
03:59:53.349 --> 03:59:53.359 align:start position:0%
all students should take the same test
 
03:59:55.670 --> 03:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
a public school student can't say i'm
 
03:59:58.229 --> 03:59:58.239 align:start position:0%
going to submit a portfolio instead
 
04:00:01.910 --> 04:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
instead of taking this chess test
 
04:00:02.870 --> 04:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:00:04.950 --> 04:00:04.960 align:start position:0%
representative mullen
 
04:00:06.630 --> 04:00:06.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
04:00:08.469 --> 04:00:08.479 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative
 
04:00:10.950 --> 04:00:10.960 align:start position:0%
cornell is there anything in your bill
 
04:00:14.550 --> 04:00:14.560 align:start position:0%
that would prevent a student from also
 
04:00:18.469 --> 04:00:18.479 align:start position:0%
keeping a portfolio to demonstrate their
 
04:00:22.150 --> 04:00:22.160 align:start position:0%
performance or competencies
 
04:00:22.160 --> 04:00:23.189 align:start position:0%
performance or competencies
no

04:00:23.189 --> 04:00:23.199 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:00:24.950 --> 04:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
that's nothing like that in the bill at
 
04:00:24.960 --> 04:00:27.429 align:start position:0%
that's nothing like that in the bill at
all

04:00:27.429 --> 04:00:27.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:29.269 --> 04:00:29.279 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the committee
 
04:00:32.389 --> 04:00:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:34.950 --> 04:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
is this a way to make
 
04:00:37.990 --> 04:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
the looking at schools and how effective
 
04:00:39.030 --> 04:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
they are
 
04:00:39.040 --> 04:00:40.469 align:start position:0%
they are
um

04:00:40.469 --> 04:00:40.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:43.670 --> 04:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
apples to apples uh so that you have
 
04:00:43.680 --> 04:00:44.550 align:start position:0%
apples to apples uh so that you have
like

04:00:44.550 --> 04:00:44.560 align:start position:0%
like
 
04:00:47.510 --> 04:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
assessments is that what the intent is
 
04:00:52.229 --> 04:00:52.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:55.030 --> 04:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative moffatt thank you
 
04:00:57.349 --> 04:00:57.359 align:start position:0%
mr thank you for taking my question and
 
04:00:59.510 --> 04:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh as you may know i'm sympathetic to
 
04:01:00.950 --> 04:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
assessments i really think there's a
 
04:01:02.389 --> 04:01:02.399 align:start position:0%
place for them so i'm really intrigued
 
04:01:04.389 --> 04:01:04.399 align:start position:0%
by this my question is
 
04:01:04.399 --> 04:01:06.389 align:start position:0%
by this my question is
homeschoolers

04:01:06.389 --> 04:01:06.399 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers
 
04:01:06.399 --> 04:01:07.110 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers
the

04:01:07.110 --> 04:01:07.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:01:09.990 --> 04:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
efas can go to homeschoolers
 
04:01:10.000 --> 04:01:11.750 align:start position:0%
efas can go to homeschoolers
so

04:01:11.750 --> 04:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:01:13.349 --> 04:01:13.359 align:start position:0%
would this measure apply to
 
04:01:13.359 --> 04:01:16.389 align:start position:0%
would this measure apply to
homeschoolers

04:01:16.389 --> 04:01:16.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:17.590 --> 04:01:17.600 align:start position:0%
you know i have to think about that
 
04:01:20.710 --> 04:01:20.720 align:start position:0%
because right now homeschoolers
 
04:01:23.830 --> 04:01:23.840 align:start position:0%
aren't under the same
 
04:01:23.840 --> 04:01:25.590 align:start position:0%
aren't under the same
as

04:01:25.590 --> 04:01:25.600 align:start position:0%
as
 
04:01:30.309 --> 04:01:30.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:32.790 --> 04:01:32.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:01:34.070 --> 04:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
representative mullen
 
04:01:35.990 --> 04:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative cordelli
 
04:01:38.150 --> 04:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
representative cornell would you believe
 
04:01:40.229 --> 04:01:40.239 align:start position:0%
that when i was a school counselor
 
04:01:42.150 --> 04:01:42.160 align:start position:0%
somewhat recently
 
04:01:45.030 --> 04:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers used to come to school
 
04:01:46.870 --> 04:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
we would send out a notice saying that
 
04:01:49.429 --> 04:01:49.439 align:start position:0%
the state assessment was being given
 
04:01:51.670 --> 04:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
and we had any number of home school
 
04:01:54.710 --> 04:01:54.720 align:start position:0%
students join us at school to take the
 
04:01:56.710 --> 04:01:56.720 align:start position:0%
state assessment there
 
04:01:56.720 --> 04:01:58.229 align:start position:0%
state assessment there
so

04:01:58.229 --> 04:01:58.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:02:01.349 --> 04:02:01.359 align:start position:0%
that that's always an option as well
 
04:02:03.750 --> 04:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
it is thank you
 
04:02:05.590 --> 04:02:05.600 align:start position:0%
representative porter
 
04:02:07.429 --> 04:02:07.439 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair representative
 
04:02:09.830 --> 04:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
cornell maybe this is unfair because you
 
04:02:12.150 --> 04:02:12.160 align:start position:0%
have eliminated the language
 
04:02:12.160 --> 04:02:12.870 align:start position:0%
have eliminated the language
in

04:02:12.870 --> 04:02:12.880 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:02:14.389 --> 04:02:14.399 align:start position:0%
the current law
 
04:02:16.950 --> 04:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
by filing this bill i'm especially
 
04:02:18.070 --> 04:02:18.080 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
04:02:21.429 --> 04:02:21.439 align:start position:0%
what would be lines 10 through
 
04:02:24.389 --> 04:02:24.399 align:start position:0%
14 about the portfolio
 
04:02:26.790 --> 04:02:26.800 align:start position:0%
my reading of that is that
 
04:02:28.790 --> 04:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
i have i'm a certified teacher in early
 
04:02:30.550 --> 04:02:30.560 align:start position:0%
childhood education
 
04:02:32.389 --> 04:02:32.399 align:start position:0%
and if i'm reading this right it would
 
04:02:35.269 --> 04:02:35.279 align:start position:0%
be permissible for parents
 
04:02:37.990 --> 04:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
of a high school chemistry student to
 
04:02:40.389 --> 04:02:40.399 align:start position:0%
use my knowledge to approve
 
04:02:42.790 --> 04:02:42.800 align:start position:0%
or express the performance of their
 
04:02:47.269 --> 04:02:47.279 align:start position:0%
child because i am a certified teacher
 
04:02:49.349 --> 04:02:49.359 align:start position:0%
is that how you read that
 
04:02:51.110 --> 04:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
is that
 
04:02:52.870 --> 04:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure are you talking about the
 
04:02:52.880 --> 04:02:54.469 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure are you talking about the
part

04:02:54.469 --> 04:02:54.479 align:start position:0%
part
 
04:02:56.070 --> 04:02:56.080 align:start position:0%
yes that's one of the reasons why you
 
04:02:58.790 --> 04:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
might have taken it out the portfolio
 
04:03:00.309 --> 04:03:00.319 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
04:03:03.269 --> 04:03:03.279 align:start position:0%
partly but partly because
 
04:03:05.269 --> 04:03:05.279 align:start position:0%
to fairly have accountability and
 
04:03:07.030 --> 04:03:07.040 align:start position:0%
transparency i think everybody should be
 
04:03:12.710 --> 04:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:14.229 --> 04:03:14.239 align:start position:0%
are there further questions represented
 
04:03:14.239 --> 04:03:16.070 align:start position:0%
are there further questions represented
litchfield

04:03:16.070 --> 04:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
litchfield
 
04:03:17.510 --> 04:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question and
 
04:03:19.110 --> 04:03:19.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:03:22.070 --> 04:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to clarify something
 
04:03:24.150 --> 04:03:24.160 align:start position:0%
right now in the public school are you
 
04:03:26.469 --> 04:03:26.479 align:start position:0%
able to opt out can a parent have a
 
04:03:33.030 --> 04:03:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:34.710 --> 04:03:34.720 align:start position:0%
i think so but i think the school is
 
04:03:37.510 --> 04:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
responsible for making sure that 95
 
04:03:41.990 --> 04:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:44.550 --> 04:03:44.560 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm not 100 sure
 
04:03:50.870 --> 04:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:53.830 --> 04:03:53.840 align:start position:0%
recently recently retired myself not
 
04:03:56.070 --> 04:03:56.080 align:start position:0%
that many do opt out in a public school
 
04:03:59.990 --> 04:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:01.189 --> 04:04:01.199 align:start position:0%
yes you may
 
04:04:03.670 --> 04:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
thank you um i just i've noticed in our
 
04:04:05.269 --> 04:04:05.279 align:start position:0%
district over the past couple years that
 
04:04:07.510 --> 04:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
many parents have started to opt out
 
04:04:08.950 --> 04:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
more and more i'm assuming it's the
 
04:04:10.550 --> 04:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
state assessment that they're opting out
 
04:04:13.510 --> 04:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
of my question is regarding this bill is
 
04:04:15.429 --> 04:04:15.439 align:start position:0%
this also going to have private schools
 
04:04:17.349 --> 04:04:17.359 align:start position:0%
be required to administer the assessment
 
04:04:21.670 --> 04:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
as well if they're getting the efa yes
 
04:04:23.750 --> 04:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
wow okay thank you
 
04:04:25.990 --> 04:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
just the point of clarification for 95
 
04:04:28.150 --> 04:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
you're correct but that is a federal
 
04:04:30.070 --> 04:04:30.080 align:start position:0%
requirement with our application for the
 
04:04:32.150 --> 04:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
monies which we're seeking out we try to
 
04:04:33.510 --> 04:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
hit that when you get down below there
 
04:04:38.870 --> 04:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:40.710 --> 04:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
okay further
 
04:04:43.750 --> 04:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:45.990 --> 04:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um i'm
 
04:04:47.349 --> 04:04:47.359 align:start position:0%
not really sure if i'm going to form
 
04:04:49.910 --> 04:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
this question correctly
 
04:04:53.189 --> 04:04:53.199 align:start position:0%
but if we have say a charter school
 
04:04:54.870 --> 04:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
or a charter schools or public schools
 
04:04:56.469 --> 04:04:56.479 align:start position:0%
so i guess that would really wouldn't it
 
04:04:59.750 --> 04:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't matter in that case but
 
04:05:02.550 --> 04:05:02.560 align:start position:0%
private schools may choose to use
 
04:05:04.790 --> 04:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
different curriculum
 
04:05:07.910 --> 04:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
to achieve the same standards
 
04:05:10.229 --> 04:05:10.239 align:start position:0%
in the statewide assessment
 
04:05:13.189 --> 04:05:13.199 align:start position:0%
would it be possible for say
 
04:05:14.790 --> 04:05:14.800 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to go back to like
 
04:05:16.389 --> 04:05:16.399 align:start position:0%
everyday math
 
04:05:16.399 --> 04:05:18.309 align:start position:0%
everyday math
um

04:05:18.309 --> 04:05:18.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:21.030 --> 04:05:21.040 align:start position:0%
for those types of questions to be on
 
04:05:23.990 --> 04:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
the statewide assessment that say maybe
 
04:05:24.000 --> 04:05:24.790 align:start position:0%
the statewide assessment that say maybe
a

04:05:24.790 --> 04:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:05:26.309 --> 04:05:26.319 align:start position:0%
private school
 
04:05:27.830 --> 04:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't use
 
04:05:29.269 --> 04:05:29.279 align:start position:0%
am i making sense is that a clear
 
04:05:29.279 --> 04:05:31.429 align:start position:0%
am i making sense is that a clear
question

04:05:31.429 --> 04:05:31.439 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:05:32.790 --> 04:05:32.800 align:start position:0%
is that a clear question
 
04:05:35.830 --> 04:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
i i think so but i i think the material
 
04:05:38.229 --> 04:05:38.239 align:start position:0%
that gets assessed is the material
 
04:05:39.990 --> 04:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
that's supposed to be covered in that
 
04:05:42.309 --> 04:05:42.319 align:start position:0%
grade so whether you're in a private
 
04:05:42.319 --> 04:05:43.189 align:start position:0%
grade so whether you're in a private
school

04:05:43.189 --> 04:05:43.199 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:05:44.790 --> 04:05:44.800 align:start position:0%
public charter
 
04:05:46.309 --> 04:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
religious school it should all be
 
04:05:47.910 --> 04:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
covering the same material in the same
 
04:05:47.920 --> 04:05:49.670 align:start position:0%
covering the same material in the same
grade

04:05:49.670 --> 04:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
grade
 
04:05:49.680 --> 04:05:50.870 align:start position:0%
grade
yes

04:05:50.870 --> 04:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:05:54.070 --> 04:05:54.080 align:start position:0%
so specifically i'm thinking of say a
 
04:05:55.910 --> 04:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
different curriculum
 
04:05:59.510 --> 04:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
being used to achieve the same standards
 
04:06:02.550 --> 04:06:02.560 align:start position:0%
the same competencies may look different
 
04:06:03.990 --> 04:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
in a
 
04:06:05.990 --> 04:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
in a private school than in a public
 
04:06:08.870 --> 04:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
school and would that cause
 
04:06:17.990 --> 04:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:23.510 --> 04:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:29.349 --> 04:06:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:32.229 --> 04:06:32.239 align:start position:0%
as i said my son when he when we use
 
04:06:32.239 --> 04:06:33.349 align:start position:0%
as i said my son when he when we use
this

04:06:33.349 --> 04:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:06:35.189 --> 04:06:35.199 align:start position:0%
we just let the school do the test
 
04:06:37.030 --> 04:06:37.040 align:start position:0%
because it was like i said faster
 
04:06:38.950 --> 04:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
cheaper and easier and he could always
 
04:06:41.990 --> 04:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
ace him so and you know one
 
04:06:44.309 --> 04:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
got it over with quickly and easily for
 
04:06:45.910 --> 04:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
me but
 
04:06:49.910 --> 04:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:51.830 --> 04:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
and i would have to set up a special
 
04:06:53.750 --> 04:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
thing with the
 
04:06:56.150 --> 04:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
guidance counselor to be able to do it
 
04:06:58.389 --> 04:06:58.399 align:start position:0%
and it has as an option
 
04:07:00.309 --> 04:07:00.319 align:start position:0%
a nationally standardized norm
 
04:07:02.229 --> 04:07:02.239 align:start position:0%
referenced achievement test and that was
 
04:07:04.070 --> 04:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
put in because a lot of the private
 
04:07:06.790 --> 04:07:06.800 align:start position:0%
schools use a different test
 
04:07:10.150 --> 04:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
it's still an assessment test
 
04:07:12.469 --> 04:07:12.479 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:07:14.790 --> 04:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
so i'm wondering are we going to have
 
04:07:16.790 --> 04:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
all these kids who don't even have i
 
04:07:18.469 --> 04:07:18.479 align:start position:0%
mean it was easy for me because he'd
 
04:07:21.349 --> 04:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
been in the school for five years
 
04:07:23.510 --> 04:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
and they knew him and it was easy to set
 
04:07:24.950 --> 04:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
up a test
 
04:07:27.189 --> 04:07:27.199 align:start position:0%
and the guidance counselor knew him and
 
04:07:29.269 --> 04:07:29.279 align:start position:0%
you know wasn't particularly worried
 
04:07:32.070 --> 04:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
about it right but
 
04:07:34.229 --> 04:07:34.239 align:start position:0%
are we gonna then have all these kids
 
04:07:35.670 --> 04:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
you know have to
 
04:07:37.910 --> 04:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
come up with some way i know
 
04:07:40.309 --> 04:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers who have been keeping a
 
04:07:42.630 --> 04:07:42.640 align:start position:0%
portfolio and have a teacher and as the
 
04:07:45.349 --> 04:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
kids got older they picked a different
 
04:07:45.359 --> 04:07:46.389 align:start position:0%
kids got older they picked a different
teacher

04:07:46.389 --> 04:07:46.399 align:start position:0%
teacher
 
04:07:48.469 --> 04:07:48.479 align:start position:0%
who was more appropriate for the age at
 
04:07:51.030 --> 04:07:51.040 align:start position:0%
which the kids were at
 
04:07:52.550 --> 04:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
how are we going to deal with this if
 
04:07:53.990 --> 04:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
we're making them all take this
 
04:07:56.070 --> 04:07:56.080 align:start position:0%
statewide assessment which isn't given
 
04:07:56.080 --> 04:07:59.910 align:start position:0%
statewide assessment which isn't given
annually

04:07:59.910 --> 04:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:02.389 --> 04:08:02.399 align:start position:0%
this is the test that's given annually
 
04:08:05.110 --> 04:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
it is given annually
 
04:08:06.870 --> 04:08:06.880 align:start position:0%
this is the statewide assessment test
 
04:08:08.870 --> 04:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
that is given every year
 
04:08:10.710 --> 04:08:10.720 align:start position:0%
okay so not the other test that you take
 
04:08:12.229 --> 04:08:12.239 align:start position:0%
in the third eighth
 
04:08:15.429 --> 04:08:15.439 align:start position:0%
and eleventh okay thank you
 
04:08:17.349 --> 04:08:17.359 align:start position:0%
i do have one question for you and i
 
04:08:19.349 --> 04:08:19.359 align:start position:0%
i'll try not to get down into the weeds
 
04:08:21.590 --> 04:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
too much on standardized testing
 
04:08:23.349 --> 04:08:23.359 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:08:25.349 --> 04:08:25.359 align:start position:0%
looking at some of those scores which we
 
04:08:28.389 --> 04:08:28.399 align:start position:0%
oftentimes oftentimes the the public
 
04:08:30.630 --> 04:08:30.640 align:start position:0%
likes to see a percentile score
 
04:08:33.349 --> 04:08:33.359 align:start position:0%
which is really uh not a score which i
 
04:08:34.790 --> 04:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
as the school administrator wanted to
 
04:08:36.550 --> 04:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
look at all the time
 
04:08:38.149 --> 04:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
uh there are other scores like a stay
 
04:08:39.269 --> 04:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
nine i won't i don't want to look at
 
04:08:41.750 --> 04:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
that either but there are some scores
 
04:08:43.910 --> 04:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
which show you that
 
04:08:45.750 --> 04:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
if you're taking the old-fashioned gates
 
04:08:47.670 --> 04:08:47.680 align:start position:0%
mckinney reading test or the iowa test
 
04:08:49.590 --> 04:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
of basic skills or the california test
 
04:08:51.830 --> 04:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
any of them there are some scores which
 
04:08:54.070 --> 04:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
parallel between them normal curve
 
04:08:56.149 --> 04:08:56.159 align:start position:0%
equivalent and then you can look at some
 
04:08:58.469 --> 04:08:58.479 align:start position:0%
growth scores as well so is there any
 
04:09:01.269 --> 04:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
reason why you have eliminated the
 
04:09:03.429 --> 04:09:03.439 align:start position:0%
national standardized norm reference
 
04:09:05.349 --> 04:09:05.359 align:start position:0%
achievement test which has those scores
 
04:09:07.590 --> 04:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
which are very comparable and relate
 
04:09:07.600 --> 04:09:08.630 align:start position:0%
which are very comparable and relate
between

04:09:08.630 --> 04:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
between
 
04:09:11.030 --> 04:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
the statewide tests that we give here
 
04:09:11.040 --> 04:09:11.830 align:start position:0%
the statewide tests that we give here
and

04:09:11.830 --> 04:09:11.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:09:14.149 --> 04:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
the achievement test which is nationally
 
04:09:16.149 --> 04:09:16.159 align:start position:0%
normed and has the nce scores and all
 
04:09:18.550 --> 04:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
that which we can compare
 
04:09:23.030 --> 04:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:24.710 --> 04:09:24.720 align:start position:0%
i guess my thought was just that it
 
04:09:26.830 --> 04:09:26.840 align:start position:0%
would be
 
04:09:29.750 --> 04:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
more um
 
04:09:29.760 --> 04:09:31.110 align:start position:0%
more um
transparent

04:09:31.110 --> 04:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
transparent
 
04:09:31.120 --> 04:09:33.590 align:start position:0%
transparent
more

04:09:33.590 --> 04:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:35.910 --> 04:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
easily looked at if everybody took the
 
04:09:39.429 --> 04:09:39.439 align:start position:0%
same test okay thank you
 
04:09:42.070 --> 04:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
representative tanner
 
04:09:44.469 --> 04:09:44.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:44.479 --> 04:09:45.349 align:start position:0%
 
the

04:09:45.349 --> 04:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:09:47.030 --> 04:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
tests that the
 
04:09:49.830 --> 04:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire allows as a
 
04:09:51.830 --> 04:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
testing level i know at the high school
 
04:09:54.309 --> 04:09:54.319 align:start position:0%
level sats were one of them
 
04:09:56.149 --> 04:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
wouldn't they be the same for everybody
 
04:09:57.910 --> 04:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
in the united states
 
04:09:59.590 --> 04:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
uh whether they were home schooled
 
04:10:01.429 --> 04:10:01.439 align:start position:0%
private schooled or whatever if you're
 
04:10:03.429 --> 04:10:03.439 align:start position:0%
if you have to take an sat test to get
 
04:10:06.389 --> 04:10:06.399 align:start position:0%
into college for college entrance it it
 
04:10:08.550 --> 04:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
effectively covers
 
04:10:10.550 --> 04:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
the general
 
04:10:12.950 --> 04:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
level of competency
 
04:10:16.070 --> 04:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
in language and math and whatever
 
04:10:18.950 --> 04:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh across the board so it wouldn't it be
 
04:10:20.950 --> 04:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
a better
 
04:10:23.349 --> 04:10:23.359 align:start position:0%
whatever we use in the public schools uh
 
04:10:26.550 --> 04:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
the knee app or the sat
 
04:10:28.710 --> 04:10:28.720 align:start position:0%
if we use that across the board then we
 
04:10:31.590 --> 04:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
could it would be a level playing field
 
04:10:33.990 --> 04:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
and we would see we could compare apples
 
04:10:35.590 --> 04:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
to apples and oranges to oranges isn't
 
04:10:35.600 --> 04:10:36.630 align:start position:0%
to apples and oranges to oranges isn't
that

04:10:36.630 --> 04:10:36.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:10:39.750 --> 04:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
what this is about yes
 
04:10:40.710 --> 04:10:40.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:10:42.710 --> 04:10:42.720 align:start position:0%
i got another pursuing question then
 
04:10:44.469 --> 04:10:44.479 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you believe that
 
04:10:47.189 --> 04:10:47.199 align:start position:0%
either the s.a.t or the act
 
04:10:49.349 --> 04:10:49.359 align:start position:0%
aren't even required by 70 of our
 
04:10:51.269 --> 04:10:51.279 align:start position:0%
colleges now wouldn't it be better then
 
04:10:52.870 --> 04:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
that we use a nationally normed
 
04:10:55.110 --> 04:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
reference test somewhere in the high
 
04:10:57.429 --> 04:10:57.439 align:start position:0%
school level to give us this information
 
04:10:59.590 --> 04:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
that you're looking for
 
04:11:01.590 --> 04:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
seeing that the sat is no longer
 
04:11:11.030 --> 04:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:13.349 --> 04:11:13.359 align:start position:0%
okay don't worry
 
04:11:15.830 --> 04:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
04:11:17.269 --> 04:11:17.279 align:start position:0%
i've got a question for you represent
 
04:11:20.870 --> 04:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
luna yes thanks thanks very much um and
 
04:11:23.429 --> 04:11:23.439 align:start position:0%
mr chair during during a comment you
 
04:11:25.429 --> 04:11:25.439 align:start position:0%
made earlier i just want to follow up
 
04:11:27.510 --> 04:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
with it because i think um i think it's
 
04:11:29.429 --> 04:11:29.439 align:start position:0%
it would be good for the committee to
 
04:11:30.790 --> 04:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
other members to
 
04:11:32.550 --> 04:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
understand it you talked about how a
 
04:11:36.149 --> 04:11:36.159 align:start position:0%
norm reference test um outcome could
 
04:11:40.309 --> 04:11:40.319 align:start position:0%
somehow be compared with with that of um
 
04:11:44.229 --> 04:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
of the sat or a statewide assessment
 
04:11:46.630 --> 04:11:46.640 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm not referencing the sat at all
 
04:11:48.389 --> 04:11:48.399 align:start position:0%
i'm representing another
 
04:11:50.950 --> 04:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
achievement norm reference achievement
 
04:11:53.670 --> 04:11:53.680 align:start position:0%
test but but so so specifically i
 
04:11:55.349 --> 04:11:55.359 align:start position:0%
thought i heard you say
 
04:11:57.990 --> 04:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
the the statewide achievement tests that
 
04:11:58.000 --> 04:11:59.349 align:start position:0%
the the statewide achievement tests that
other

04:11:59.349 --> 04:11:59.359 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:12:01.910 --> 04:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
students in public schools are taking
 
04:12:04.309 --> 04:12:04.319 align:start position:0%
and that a norm reference test could
 
04:12:06.790 --> 04:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
could be
 
04:12:09.189 --> 04:12:09.199 align:start position:0%
measured an outcome on a norm reference
 
04:12:10.790 --> 04:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
test could be measured
 
04:12:13.189 --> 04:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
comparably to that so that and i think
 
04:12:15.750 --> 04:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
you use the term apples to apples if if
 
04:12:17.670 --> 04:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
you're using the right type of
 
04:12:19.590 --> 04:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
comparative data
 
04:12:21.429 --> 04:12:21.439 align:start position:0%
from that test
 
04:12:23.030 --> 04:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
you don't want to take your percentile
 
04:12:25.030 --> 04:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
score but if you take another
 
04:12:28.149 --> 04:12:28.159 align:start position:0%
score which is designed around
 
04:12:29.910 --> 04:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to achieve here in
 
04:12:32.070 --> 04:12:32.080 align:start position:0%
terms of looking at
 
04:12:34.469 --> 04:12:34.479 align:start position:0%
two different achievement tests you can
 
04:12:36.469 --> 04:12:36.479 align:start position:0%
do it it's not just a percentile against
 
04:12:37.590 --> 04:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
a certain
 
04:12:39.349 --> 04:12:39.359 align:start position:0%
number of students that are above or
 
04:12:42.710 --> 04:12:42.720 align:start position:0%
below within that particular group
 
04:12:44.790 --> 04:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
that's taking it in your school
 
04:12:44.800 --> 04:12:46.229 align:start position:0%
that's taking it in your school
um

04:12:46.229 --> 04:12:46.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:48.229 --> 04:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
and that's that's uh
 
04:12:51.030 --> 04:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
what i'm what i said was that it you can
 
04:12:51.040 --> 04:12:52.070 align:start position:0%
what i'm what i said was that it you can
compare

04:12:52.070 --> 04:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
compare
 
04:12:55.750 --> 04:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
data from an iowa test a california test
 
04:12:58.389 --> 04:12:58.399 align:start position:0%
any of those achievement tests
 
04:13:01.189 --> 04:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
if you use the proper
 
04:13:02.950 --> 04:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
testing data
 
04:13:04.950 --> 04:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't use a percentile score to
 
04:13:06.309 --> 04:13:06.319 align:start position:0%
do that
 
04:13:08.389 --> 04:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
you'd use something like a normal curve
 
04:13:10.149 --> 04:13:10.159 align:start position:0%
equivalent score
 
04:13:11.590 --> 04:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
and i can see
 
04:13:13.510 --> 04:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of test and measurement
 
04:13:15.590 --> 04:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
information out there that i think that
 
04:13:18.710 --> 04:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
at this particular committee uh
 
04:13:20.229 --> 04:13:20.239 align:start position:0%
we would have to get
 
04:13:22.469 --> 04:13:22.479 align:start position:0%
you know uh people that are familiar
 
04:13:24.229 --> 04:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
with it to really get a good
 
04:13:26.149 --> 04:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
understanding here right right well we
 
04:13:28.870 --> 04:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
have have that you know college class
 
04:13:31.990 --> 04:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
under our belts and even at that time
 
04:13:33.189 --> 04:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
04:13:35.110 --> 04:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
no thanks thank you but you can compare
 
04:13:36.710 --> 04:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
achievement tests to achievable i'm sure
 
04:13:38.070 --> 04:13:38.080 align:start position:0%
i'm sure you can i oftentimes did it
 
04:13:39.830 --> 04:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
with the case mckinney and with an
 
04:13:42.469 --> 04:13:42.479 align:start position:0%
achievement test in the area of reading
 
04:13:44.149 --> 04:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
or comprehension okay
 
04:13:46.149 --> 04:13:46.159 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you yes representative
 
04:13:46.159 --> 04:13:47.110 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you yes representative
porter

04:13:47.110 --> 04:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
porter
 
04:13:49.750 --> 04:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh representative one
 
04:13:51.750 --> 04:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
of the things that we hear a lot is that
 
04:13:53.349 --> 04:13:53.359 align:start position:0%
with the federal money comes
 
04:13:57.670 --> 04:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:59.750 --> 04:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
is it your intent with this bill
 
04:14:01.830 --> 04:14:01.840 align:start position:0%
that if
 
04:14:04.229 --> 04:14:04.239 align:start position:0%
state money is going to an ins a
 
04:14:06.389 --> 04:14:06.399 align:start position:0%
provider an education provider that they
 
04:14:09.189 --> 04:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
also have some requirements
 
04:14:10.710 --> 04:14:10.720 align:start position:0%
that they have to
 
04:14:14.070 --> 04:14:14.080 align:start position:0%
uphold in order to keep receiving
 
04:14:17.670 --> 04:14:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:19.030 --> 04:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
i don't know i
 
04:14:21.990 --> 04:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
didn't say in the bill that it would
 
04:14:24.149 --> 04:14:24.159 align:start position:0%
result in their losing the money or not
 
04:14:25.269 --> 04:14:25.279 align:start position:0%
it just
 
04:14:28.149 --> 04:14:28.159 align:start position:0%
that they should take the same um
 
04:14:30.710 --> 04:14:30.720 align:start position:0%
achievement tests it won't they won't
 
04:14:32.710 --> 04:14:32.720 align:start position:0%
lose their money if the students don't
 
04:14:35.030 --> 04:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
do well on it no but would it be a
 
04:14:39.269 --> 04:14:39.279 align:start position:0%
requirement in receiving an efa student
 
04:14:41.030 --> 04:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
that they'd give this test because
 
04:14:42.790 --> 04:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
they're receiving state money with that
 
04:14:45.189 --> 04:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
student yes
 
04:14:48.149 --> 04:14:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:50.790 --> 04:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
not yes represent litchfield
 
04:14:51.830 --> 04:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
04:14:53.349 --> 04:14:53.359 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to figure out a way to wrap
 
04:14:55.030 --> 04:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
three and one and i don't know how i'm
 
04:14:58.149 --> 04:14:58.159 align:start position:0%
just trying to understand it so
 
04:15:00.309 --> 04:15:00.319 align:start position:0%
if you're saying that the results of the
 
04:15:02.550 --> 04:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
test they don't i don't want to say they
 
04:15:03.910 --> 04:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
don't matter because that's not a
 
04:15:05.670 --> 04:15:05.680 align:start position:0%
correct way to put it but
 
04:15:07.349 --> 04:15:07.359 align:start position:0%
what's the point of them taking the test
 
04:15:10.149 --> 04:15:10.159 align:start position:0%
what is the end goal here
 
04:15:13.590 --> 04:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
i think a lot of the arguments for efas
 
04:15:15.750 --> 04:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
were students were not doing well in
 
04:15:17.510 --> 04:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
their public school and they want to go
 
04:15:19.990 --> 04:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
to a private school where they will do
 
04:15:21.750 --> 04:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
where they do much better and this would
 
04:15:23.750 --> 04:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
be a way of measuring
 
04:15:26.630 --> 04:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
um are they doing better in the private
 
04:15:26.640 --> 04:15:28.469 align:start position:0%
um are they doing better in the private
school

04:15:28.469 --> 04:15:28.479 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:15:28.479 --> 04:15:29.189 align:start position:0%
school
yes

04:15:29.189 --> 04:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:15:33.189 --> 04:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
so we are going to use the results then
 
04:15:35.510 --> 04:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
and are they not anonymous too at that
 
04:15:35.520 --> 04:15:37.269 align:start position:0%
and are they not anonymous too at that
point

04:15:37.269 --> 04:15:37.279 align:start position:0%
point
 
04:15:38.469 --> 04:15:38.479 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to understand i have
 
04:15:40.309 --> 04:15:40.319 align:start position:0%
children in public and private school
 
04:15:42.149 --> 04:15:42.159 align:start position:0%
and the beauty of a private school is it
 
04:15:43.990 --> 04:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
is accredited and i trust that they're
 
04:15:46.070 --> 04:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
going to do a good job and you know
 
04:15:47.590 --> 04:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
people argue do you teach to the test i
 
04:15:49.110 --> 04:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
don't worry about any of that the kids
 
04:15:50.469 --> 04:15:50.479 align:start position:0%
don't have to deal with that so my
 
04:15:51.750 --> 04:15:51.760 align:start position:0%
question is i'm just trying to
 
04:15:53.590 --> 04:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
understand what is the point of giving
 
04:15:55.110 --> 04:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
an assessment if we're not going to do
 
04:15:57.189 --> 04:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
anything with it but now i feel like i'm
 
04:15:59.110 --> 04:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
hearing you say that yes we are going to
 
04:16:02.309 --> 04:16:02.319 align:start position:0%
use it to measure the private schools
 
04:16:04.070 --> 04:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to use it to measure the
 
04:16:07.110 --> 04:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
students that are getting the efa if
 
04:16:09.750 --> 04:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
they're if they are achieving
 
04:16:12.070 --> 04:16:12.080 align:start position:0%
just compare to themselves
 
04:16:14.229 --> 04:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
okay so maybe just one more sure is
 
04:16:16.070 --> 04:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
there would there be a financial note
 
04:16:17.990 --> 04:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
with this though who would who would
 
04:16:24.309 --> 04:16:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:26.229 --> 04:16:26.239 align:start position:0%
it would be part of the private school
 
04:16:26.239 --> 04:16:27.429 align:start position:0%
it would be part of the private school
program

04:16:27.429 --> 04:16:27.439 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:16:32.229 --> 04:16:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:34.550 --> 04:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
it would be paid by the state
 
04:16:36.309 --> 04:16:36.319 align:start position:0%
because it's already agreed that you
 
04:16:37.750 --> 04:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
know you can bring a kid and get the
 
04:16:37.760 --> 04:16:39.429 align:start position:0%
know you can bring a kid and get the
test

04:16:39.429 --> 04:16:39.439 align:start position:0%
test
 
04:16:41.670 --> 04:16:41.680 align:start position:0%
from a private school to the resident
 
04:16:48.149 --> 04:16:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:50.070 --> 04:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
represent nelson
 
04:16:51.510 --> 04:16:51.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
04:16:53.590 --> 04:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
taking the question you mentioned that
 
04:16:55.990 --> 04:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
private schools would lose the money how
 
04:16:58.229 --> 04:16:58.239 align:start position:0%
about public schools i never said
 
04:17:00.070 --> 04:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
anything about losing money i thought it
 
04:17:01.750 --> 04:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
was discussed that if a private school
 
04:17:03.590 --> 04:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
didn't reach a certain thing they would
 
04:17:05.429 --> 04:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
lose their money from the state coming
 
04:17:10.550 --> 04:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:12.710 --> 04:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
oh more questions
 
04:17:14.950 --> 04:17:14.960 align:start position:0%
it's your day you hit the jackpot it
 
04:17:17.189 --> 04:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
represents like us
 
04:17:18.710 --> 04:17:18.720 align:start position:0%
i'm still
 
04:17:20.710 --> 04:17:20.720 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm still wondering how you're
 
04:17:23.269 --> 04:17:23.279 align:start position:0%
going to deal with the special needs
 
04:17:25.349 --> 04:17:25.359 align:start position:0%
kids because as we heard an awful lot of
 
04:17:27.429 --> 04:17:27.439 align:start position:0%
the kids who do
 
04:17:29.670 --> 04:17:29.680 align:start position:0%
and they may be homeschooled not private
 
04:17:29.680 --> 04:17:31.030 align:start position:0%
and they may be homeschooled not private
schooled

04:17:31.030 --> 04:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
schooled
 
04:17:31.040 --> 04:17:33.830 align:start position:0%
schooled
um

04:17:33.830 --> 04:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:35.830 --> 04:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
how are you gonna do like
 
04:17:37.670 --> 04:17:37.680 align:start position:0%
i know home school kids who are
 
04:17:40.149 --> 04:17:40.159 align:start position:0%
extremely dyslexic and their spelling is
 
04:17:42.389 --> 04:17:42.399 align:start position:0%
something that you wouldn't even
 
04:17:45.510 --> 04:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
it's challenging to read
 
04:17:45.520 --> 04:17:46.309 align:start position:0%
it's challenging to read
but

04:17:46.309 --> 04:17:46.319 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:17:48.550 --> 04:17:48.560 align:start position:0%
they are phenomenal in chemistry which
 
04:17:51.189 --> 04:17:51.199 align:start position:0%
isn't tested on the standardized test
 
04:17:53.670 --> 04:17:53.680 align:start position:0%
phenomenal in electricity and magnetism
 
04:17:56.229 --> 04:17:56.239 align:start position:0%
which isn't tested and i'm wondering and
 
04:17:59.429 --> 04:17:59.439 align:start position:0%
their progress is slow i mean we see
 
04:18:00.870 --> 04:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
from year to year they get a little
 
04:18:03.429 --> 04:18:03.439 align:start position:0%
better but in the percentiles they may
 
04:18:04.870 --> 04:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
not get better they may look like
 
04:18:07.110 --> 04:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
they're getting worse compared to their
 
04:18:07.120 --> 04:18:08.790 align:start position:0%
they're getting worse compared to their
classmates

04:18:08.790 --> 04:18:08.800 align:start position:0%
classmates
 
04:18:11.750 --> 04:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
but compared to themselves
 
04:18:14.630 --> 04:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
they they are slowly getting better at
 
04:18:16.469 --> 04:18:16.479 align:start position:0%
spelling but it's because they're very
 
04:18:19.030 --> 04:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
dyslexic and that's a learning
 
04:18:19.040 --> 04:18:20.469 align:start position:0%
dyslexic and that's a learning
disability

04:18:20.469 --> 04:18:20.479 align:start position:0%
disability
 
04:18:21.830 --> 04:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering i still don't
 
04:18:23.429 --> 04:18:23.439 align:start position:0%
understand how you're going to deal with
 
04:18:25.670 --> 04:18:25.680 align:start position:0%
that that was part of the point of the
 
04:18:25.680 --> 04:18:27.189 align:start position:0%
that that was part of the point of the
portfolios

04:18:27.189 --> 04:18:27.199 align:start position:0%
portfolios
 
04:18:29.269 --> 04:18:29.279 align:start position:0%
because then they're not taking this
 
04:18:31.670 --> 04:18:31.680 align:start position:0%
standardized test they're able to
 
04:18:33.590 --> 04:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
display their work
 
04:18:34.950 --> 04:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
and say
 
04:18:37.269 --> 04:18:37.279 align:start position:0%
see the progress i've made
 
04:18:39.510 --> 04:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
and progress in all kinds of fields that
 
04:18:41.269 --> 04:18:41.279 align:start position:0%
aren't even tested so you can see
 
04:18:42.950 --> 04:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
they're learning a lot
 
04:18:45.830 --> 04:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
even if their spelling is very slow and
 
04:18:45.840 --> 04:18:49.030 align:start position:0%
even if their spelling is very slow and
improving

04:18:49.030 --> 04:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:50.630 --> 04:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
so that's how are you going to deal with
 
04:18:52.630 --> 04:18:52.640 align:start position:0%
them that's my question
 
04:18:54.790 --> 04:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
accommodations for testing can be in the
 
04:18:54.800 --> 04:18:56.870 align:start position:0%
accommodations for testing can be in the
iep

04:18:56.870 --> 04:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
iep
 
04:18:58.950 --> 04:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
but homeschool kids don't have an iep
 
04:19:00.870 --> 04:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
that's my point
 
04:19:03.110 --> 04:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
how do you deal with them
 
04:19:04.870 --> 04:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
because that's a lot of homeschoolers
 
04:19:07.670 --> 04:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
are special needs kids
 
04:19:14.070 --> 04:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:16.309 --> 04:19:16.319 align:start position:0%
i i think what we can do is some of this
 
04:19:18.070 --> 04:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
can be discussed during executive
 
04:19:20.309 --> 04:19:20.319 align:start position:0%
session i i don't think we need to
 
04:19:22.469 --> 04:19:22.479 align:start position:0%
rattle through all this right now
 
04:19:23.830 --> 04:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
um there's
 
04:19:25.510 --> 04:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
getting in the area of special education
 
04:19:27.830 --> 04:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of alternative ways of
 
04:19:30.389 --> 04:19:30.399 align:start position:0%
assessing a child that's in special ed
 
04:19:32.309 --> 04:19:32.319 align:start position:0%
including not giving the statewide
 
04:19:32.319 --> 04:19:33.990 align:start position:0%
including not giving the statewide
assessment

04:19:33.990 --> 04:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
04:19:35.910 --> 04:19:35.920 align:start position:0%
and there's alternatives so we can
 
04:19:37.510 --> 04:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
discuss that in executive session when
 
04:19:38.950 --> 04:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
we get there
 
04:19:40.870 --> 04:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
are there any remaining questions for
 
04:19:43.429 --> 04:19:43.439 align:start position:0%
representative cornell
 
04:19:54.469 --> 04:19:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:57.670 --> 04:19:57.680 align:start position:0%
okay we have uh
 
04:20:00.550 --> 04:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
sarah scott from the americans for
 
04:20:00.560 --> 04:20:11.269 align:start position:0%
sarah scott from the americans for
prosperity

04:20:11.269 --> 04:20:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:13.429 --> 04:20:13.439 align:start position:0%
all right thank you mr chairman and
 
04:20:14.870 --> 04:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the
 
04:20:17.349 --> 04:20:17.359 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify here
 
04:20:19.110 --> 04:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
my name is sarah scott and i'm the
 
04:20:21.189 --> 04:20:21.199 align:start position:0%
director of grassroots operations with
 
04:20:23.590 --> 04:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
americans for prosperity new hampshire
 
04:20:26.950 --> 04:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
and on behalf of afp new hampshire and
 
04:20:29.429 --> 04:20:29.439 align:start position:0%
our activists all across the state
 
04:20:30.630 --> 04:20:30.640 align:start position:0%
we urge you to
 
04:20:34.070 --> 04:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
oppose house bill 1115 which changes the
 
04:20:35.990 --> 04:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
assessment requirements for students
 
04:20:37.990 --> 04:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
participating in the education freedom
 
04:20:39.910 --> 04:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
accounts program
 
04:20:41.670 --> 04:20:41.680 align:start position:0%
under the legislation that was passed
 
04:20:44.309 --> 04:20:44.319 align:start position:0%
last year efa students have three
 
04:20:46.550 --> 04:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
options for assessment that are in line
 
04:20:48.070 --> 04:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
with the requirements that we have
 
04:20:50.389 --> 04:20:50.399 align:start position:0%
currently for home educated students
 
04:20:52.070 --> 04:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
this bill would take away two of those
 
04:20:54.469 --> 04:20:54.479 align:start position:0%
options and force parents and schools
 
04:20:56.469 --> 04:20:56.479 align:start position:0%
into a single assessment that is
 
04:20:58.469 --> 04:20:58.479 align:start position:0%
inconsistent with our currently approved
 
04:20:58.479 --> 04:20:59.510 align:start position:0%
inconsistent with our currently approved
options

04:20:59.510 --> 04:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
options
 
04:21:01.030 --> 04:21:01.040 align:start position:0%
right now students who are in a private
 
04:21:02.630 --> 04:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
school are already taking approved
 
04:21:04.070 --> 04:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
assessments and students who are
 
04:21:06.630 --> 04:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
educated at home are also fulfilling an
 
04:21:09.030 --> 04:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
approved assessment requirement
 
04:21:11.189 --> 04:21:11.199 align:start position:0%
there's no reason to test efa students
 
04:21:13.110 --> 04:21:13.120 align:start position:0%
any differently than we do the students
 
04:21:15.349 --> 04:21:15.359 align:start position:0%
who are at accredited schools or who are
 
04:21:17.189 --> 04:21:17.199 align:start position:0%
home educated
 
04:21:18.790 --> 04:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
this legislation would really just
 
04:21:21.030 --> 04:21:21.040 align:start position:0%
create an unnecessary burden for
 
04:21:23.189 --> 04:21:23.199 align:start position:0%
families and educators who are already
 
04:21:24.790 --> 04:21:24.800 align:start position:0%
working hard to stay compliant with
 
04:21:26.630 --> 04:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
assessment requirements
 
04:21:28.309 --> 04:21:28.319 align:start position:0%
and kids really learn in so many
 
04:21:30.469 --> 04:21:30.479 align:start position:0%
different ways and providing multiple
 
04:21:32.790 --> 04:21:32.800 align:start position:0%
options for assessment really ensures
 
04:21:34.550 --> 04:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
that we are more accurately able to
 
04:21:34.560 --> 04:21:35.750 align:start position:0%
that we are more accurately able to
review

04:21:35.750 --> 04:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
review
 
04:21:37.510 --> 04:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
student achievement and also remain
 
04:21:39.590 --> 04:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
consistent with the current assessment
 
04:21:42.469 --> 04:21:42.479 align:start position:0%
requirements we have across the board
 
04:21:45.189 --> 04:21:45.199 align:start position:0%
if efas lead to new education models
 
04:21:47.429 --> 04:21:47.439 align:start position:0%
outside of the accredited schools
 
04:21:49.429 --> 04:21:49.439 align:start position:0%
approved state programs and home
 
04:21:49.439 --> 04:21:50.630 align:start position:0%
approved state programs and home
education

04:21:50.630 --> 04:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
education
 
04:21:52.389 --> 04:21:52.399 align:start position:0%
then we could revisit testing models at
 
04:21:54.469 --> 04:21:54.479 align:start position:0%
some point but right now i think this is
 
04:21:54.479 --> 04:21:55.910 align:start position:0%
some point but right now i think this is
premature

04:21:55.910 --> 04:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
premature
 
04:21:57.990 --> 04:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
all of our approved education options
 
04:22:00.149 --> 04:22:00.159 align:start position:0%
have a system in place already to review
 
04:22:02.309 --> 04:22:02.319 align:start position:0%
student achievement so it's for these
 
04:22:04.870 --> 04:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
reasons that we ask that you oppose this
 
04:22:04.880 --> 04:22:06.309 align:start position:0%
reasons that we ask that you oppose this
bill

04:22:06.309 --> 04:22:06.319 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:22:07.910 --> 04:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
and happy to take questions thank you
 
04:22:10.870 --> 04:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
very much are there any questions
 
04:22:10.880 --> 04:22:12.469 align:start position:0%
very much are there any questions
perhaps

04:22:12.469 --> 04:22:12.479 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
04:22:14.469 --> 04:22:14.479 align:start position:0%
thank you very much excuse me thank you
 
04:22:15.990 --> 04:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
very much mr chair
 
04:22:17.990 --> 04:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much miss scott a couple
 
04:22:20.070 --> 04:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
times you just mentioned um
 
04:22:22.790 --> 04:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
um uh people that are quoting i think i
 
04:22:24.630 --> 04:22:24.640 align:start position:0%
got your quote right already working
 
04:22:26.550 --> 04:22:26.560 align:start position:0%
hard to be in compliance with assessment
 
04:22:27.990 --> 04:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
requirements i was wondering if you
 
04:22:29.510 --> 04:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
could tell us what those assessment
 
04:22:31.349 --> 04:22:31.359 align:start position:0%
requirements are that they're already
 
04:22:33.189 --> 04:22:33.199 align:start position:0%
working hard on so the current
 
04:22:35.349 --> 04:22:35.359 align:start position:0%
assessments uh for home educated
 
04:22:36.550 --> 04:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
students in particular is what i'm
 
04:22:38.550 --> 04:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
referencing um there are the three
 
04:22:41.030 --> 04:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
options and especially a lot of students
 
04:22:43.429 --> 04:22:43.439 align:start position:0%
do the portfolio review and they're very
 
04:22:44.950 --> 04:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
diligent throughout the year to keep
 
04:22:47.110 --> 04:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
track of all of their work and put
 
04:22:47.120 --> 04:22:48.149 align:start position:0%
track of all of their work and put
together

04:22:48.149 --> 04:22:48.159 align:start position:0%
together
 
04:22:50.149 --> 04:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
we're not talking like a couple of pages
 
04:22:52.389 --> 04:22:52.399 align:start position:0%
here they're fairly substantial binders
 
04:22:54.790 --> 04:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
of work okay so follow-up so you're
 
04:22:55.990 --> 04:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
04:22:56.000 --> 04:22:57.429 align:start position:0%
talking about
these

04:22:57.429 --> 04:22:57.439 align:start position:0%
these
 
04:22:59.590 --> 04:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
requirements that are in place right now
 
04:23:01.590 --> 04:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
for home school
 
04:23:01.600 --> 04:23:02.950 align:start position:0%
for home school
students

04:23:02.950 --> 04:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
students
 
04:23:05.910 --> 04:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
who are not part of the the efa program
 
04:23:08.149 --> 04:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
obviously the requirement here is for
 
04:23:10.229 --> 04:23:10.239 align:start position:0%
students that are participating in the
 
04:23:13.590 --> 04:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
efa program so so the question would be
 
04:23:17.429 --> 04:23:17.439 align:start position:0%
do you feel that that accountability
 
04:23:17.439 --> 04:23:18.229 align:start position:0%
do you feel that that accountability
in

04:23:18.229 --> 04:23:18.239 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:23:19.910 --> 04:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
accountability and transparency is
 
04:23:23.349 --> 04:23:23.359 align:start position:0%
important in a any program that uses
 
04:23:25.429 --> 04:23:25.439 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars
 
04:23:27.590 --> 04:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
i think we already have systems systems
 
04:23:30.229 --> 04:23:30.239 align:start position:0%
in place for all of the approved options
 
04:23:32.389 --> 04:23:32.399 align:start position:0%
and i don't see why an efa student would
 
04:23:34.469 --> 04:23:34.479 align:start position:0%
be tested any differently than we test
 
04:23:38.389 --> 04:23:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:39.510 --> 04:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
representative porter and then
 
04:23:39.520 --> 04:23:40.830 align:start position:0%
representative porter and then
representative

04:23:40.830 --> 04:23:40.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:23:43.110 --> 04:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
tanner thank you mr chair i'm going to
 
04:23:44.950 --> 04:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
ask my question again
 
04:23:47.189 --> 04:23:47.199 align:start position:0%
to you because you obviously know more
 
04:23:49.269 --> 04:23:49.279 align:start position:0%
about how things are working
 
04:23:51.750 --> 04:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
i have a certificate
 
04:23:53.910 --> 04:23:53.920 align:start position:0%
in early childhood education
 
04:23:57.269 --> 04:23:57.279 align:start position:0%
could a parent use me to assess the
 
04:23:59.110 --> 04:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
portfolio for their high school
 
04:24:01.510 --> 04:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
chemistry student
 
04:24:03.030 --> 04:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question
 
04:24:07.030 --> 04:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
so um i don't know specifically i would
 
04:24:10.550 --> 04:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
assume it is probably legally allowed
 
04:24:12.630 --> 04:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
but typically parents choose somebody
 
04:24:14.469 --> 04:24:14.479 align:start position:0%
that is in line with
 
04:24:16.469 --> 04:24:16.479 align:start position:0%
the student's progress
 
04:24:18.229 --> 04:24:18.239 align:start position:0%
parents do use these assessments and
 
04:24:19.990 --> 04:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
portfolio reviews as their own
 
04:24:21.750 --> 04:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
assessment they don't do it just to
 
04:24:26.469 --> 04:24:26.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:29.030 --> 04:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
do you have any statistics on that
 
04:24:30.550 --> 04:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
i don't believe any statistics are
 
04:24:30.560 --> 04:24:31.990 align:start position:0%
i don't believe any statistics are
collected

04:24:31.990 --> 04:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
collected
 
04:24:33.510 --> 04:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:24:35.750 --> 04:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
representative tanner
 
04:24:37.189 --> 04:24:37.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
04:24:38.710 --> 04:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
taking my questions
 
04:24:38.720 --> 04:24:39.670 align:start position:0%
taking my questions
um

04:24:39.670 --> 04:24:39.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:41.510 --> 04:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
how do you think
 
04:24:44.870 --> 04:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
the public can be assured
 
04:24:44.880 --> 04:24:45.750 align:start position:0%
the public can be assured
that

04:24:45.750 --> 04:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:24:45.760 --> 04:24:46.950 align:start position:0%
that
without

04:24:46.950 --> 04:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
without
 
04:24:49.990 --> 04:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
without public view of assessment and
 
04:24:52.790 --> 04:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
and like you do with the public schools
 
04:24:54.790 --> 04:24:54.800 align:start position:0%
that their public funds
 
04:24:57.030 --> 04:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
are being spent the way they're supposed
 
04:24:59.030 --> 04:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
to be spent and effectively and
 
04:24:59.040 --> 04:25:00.309 align:start position:0%
to be spent and effectively and
efficiently

04:25:00.309 --> 04:25:00.319 align:start position:0%
efficiently
 
04:25:00.319 --> 04:25:02.630 align:start position:0%
efficiently
um

04:25:02.630 --> 04:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:04.790 --> 04:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
because i don't think those other
 
04:25:06.870 --> 04:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
assessments or the assessments of the
 
04:25:08.710 --> 04:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
efa program
 
04:25:10.790 --> 04:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
the private schools or the
 
04:25:10.800 --> 04:25:12.309 align:start position:0%
the private schools or the
homeschoolers

04:25:12.309 --> 04:25:12.319 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers
 
04:25:14.630 --> 04:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
that there's a public accounting
 
04:25:17.429 --> 04:25:17.439 align:start position:0%
of what happens with those assessments
 
04:25:19.030 --> 04:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
each year like there is for the public
 
04:25:22.149 --> 04:25:22.159 align:start position:0%
schools uh thanks for the question so i
 
04:25:24.710 --> 04:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
would just say that um in particular for
 
04:25:26.469 --> 04:25:26.479 align:start position:0%
the students who are doing a portfolio
 
04:25:26.479 --> 04:25:27.590 align:start position:0%
the students who are doing a portfolio
review

04:25:27.590 --> 04:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
review
 
04:25:29.429 --> 04:25:29.439 align:start position:0%
a certified teacher does have to review
 
04:25:30.710 --> 04:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
it and
 
04:25:33.110 --> 04:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that the student is
 
04:25:35.110 --> 04:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
at academic levels that they should be
 
04:25:36.710 --> 04:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
so i think we're really trusting that
 
04:25:38.389 --> 04:25:38.399 align:start position:0%
the teachers we've certified through the
 
04:25:40.149 --> 04:25:40.159 align:start position:0%
state are accurate in their assessments
 
04:25:43.269 --> 04:25:43.279 align:start position:0%
of the students performance
 
04:25:43.279 --> 04:25:45.670 align:start position:0%
of the students performance
yes

04:25:45.670 --> 04:25:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:48.550 --> 04:25:48.560 align:start position:0%
my question was more about
 
04:25:51.189 --> 04:25:51.199 align:start position:0%
transparency and accountability for the
 
04:25:51.199 --> 04:25:52.149 align:start position:0%
transparency and accountability for the
public

04:25:52.149 --> 04:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
public
 
04:25:54.630 --> 04:25:54.640 align:start position:0%
because now we're using public funds
 
04:25:56.550 --> 04:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
to support these programs
 
04:25:57.349 --> 04:25:57.359 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:25:59.429 --> 04:25:59.439 align:start position:0%
rather than a home school program before
 
04:26:01.349 --> 04:26:01.359 align:start position:0%
where we didn't have public funds
 
04:26:02.550 --> 04:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
supporting them
 
04:26:04.229 --> 04:26:04.239 align:start position:0%
and every year
 
04:26:06.550 --> 04:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
the public school system
 
04:26:06.560 --> 04:26:07.990 align:start position:0%
the public school system
has

04:26:07.990 --> 04:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
has
 
04:26:10.229 --> 04:26:10.239 align:start position:0%
there is published at the doe and also
 
04:26:12.229 --> 04:26:12.239 align:start position:0%
in a lot of papers
 
04:26:15.110 --> 04:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
the results of assessments uh aggregate
 
04:26:15.120 --> 04:26:16.630 align:start position:0%
the results of assessments uh aggregate
assessments

04:26:16.630 --> 04:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
assessments
 
04:26:18.550 --> 04:26:18.560 align:start position:0%
for schools and often schools are
 
04:26:20.469 --> 04:26:20.479 align:start position:0%
compared one against the other about how
 
04:26:22.469 --> 04:26:22.479 align:start position:0%
their achievement scores are
 
04:26:24.950 --> 04:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
whether they're above or below in math
 
04:26:27.670 --> 04:26:27.680 align:start position:0%
we use those we use the data here in in
 
04:26:29.429 --> 04:26:29.439 align:start position:0%
the education
 
04:26:32.790 --> 04:26:32.800 align:start position:0%
committee to make certain decisions
 
04:26:35.670 --> 04:26:35.680 align:start position:0%
and i'm just wondering how
 
04:26:37.349 --> 04:26:37.359 align:start position:0%
how you feel we could
 
04:26:39.990 --> 04:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
use the current assessment program
 
04:26:42.950 --> 04:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
and assure the public
 
04:26:44.950 --> 04:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
with transparency
 
04:26:48.229 --> 04:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
that uh the the prog our money is being
 
04:26:50.149 --> 04:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
spent efficiently effectively and that
 
04:26:52.229 --> 04:26:52.239 align:start position:0%
students are actually learning
 
04:26:54.389 --> 04:26:54.399 align:start position:0%
uh i think that by showing the public
 
04:26:56.870 --> 04:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
that these students did achieve at grade
 
04:26:59.110 --> 04:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
level we've done our part to ensure
 
04:27:01.590 --> 04:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
transparency and that the education for
 
04:27:05.910 --> 04:27:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:08.790 --> 04:27:08.800 align:start position:0%
further questions represent cordelia
 
04:27:10.630 --> 04:27:10.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
04:27:13.189 --> 04:27:13.199 align:start position:0%
miss scott for being here
 
04:27:15.269 --> 04:27:15.279 align:start position:0%
since one of the
 
04:27:17.349 --> 04:27:17.359 align:start position:0%
testing options that is being eliminated
 
04:27:19.830 --> 04:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
is the portfolio similar to what is in
 
04:27:19.840 --> 04:27:20.710 align:start position:0%
is the portfolio similar to what is in
place

04:27:20.710 --> 04:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
place
 
04:27:22.790 --> 04:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
for homeschool children
 
04:27:25.110 --> 04:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
do you have any information on
 
04:27:27.429 --> 04:27:27.439 align:start position:0%
achievement levels for home school
 
04:27:27.439 --> 04:27:28.870 align:start position:0%
achievement levels for home school
students

04:27:28.870 --> 04:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
students
 
04:27:31.429 --> 04:27:31.439 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question in all of
 
04:27:33.110 --> 04:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
the studies that have been done
 
04:27:34.710 --> 04:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
homeschool students have consistently
 
04:27:36.149 --> 04:27:36.159 align:start position:0%
ranked above
 
04:27:38.550 --> 04:27:38.560 align:start position:0%
many other education options
 
04:27:40.469 --> 04:27:40.479 align:start position:0%
i know a number of homeschoolers do take
 
04:27:40.479 --> 04:27:41.189 align:start position:0%
i know a number of homeschoolers do take
the

04:27:41.189 --> 04:27:41.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:27:43.349 --> 04:27:43.359 align:start position:0%
nationally recognized standardized tests
 
04:27:45.189 --> 04:27:45.199 align:start position:0%
and in the information that's been
 
04:27:47.189 --> 04:27:47.199 align:start position:0%
collected for those the students have
 
04:27:48.950 --> 04:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
consistently ranked among the top
 
04:27:48.960 --> 04:27:52.070 align:start position:0%
consistently ranked among the top
students

04:27:52.070 --> 04:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:54.710 --> 04:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
further questions represent luna sure
 
04:27:56.710 --> 04:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair um that's
 
04:27:58.550 --> 04:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
very interesting uh thanks for bringing
 
04:28:00.870 --> 04:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
that up does the department of education
 
04:28:03.110 --> 04:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
uh collect that information and provide
 
04:28:05.110 --> 04:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
it for comparison purposes
 
04:28:06.710 --> 04:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
the students that take the nationally
 
04:28:08.550 --> 04:28:08.560 align:start position:0%
recognized test that's
 
04:28:11.189 --> 04:28:11.199 align:start position:0%
collected by the testing service not by
 
04:28:14.630 --> 04:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire department
 
04:28:16.630 --> 04:28:16.640 align:start position:0%
so there's no way to validate what so
 
04:28:18.389 --> 04:28:18.399 align:start position:0%
let me say it another way how did you
 
04:28:20.389 --> 04:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
come across this information
 
04:28:22.630 --> 04:28:22.640 align:start position:0%
uh this is just based on studies that
 
04:28:23.910 --> 04:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
have been done that are out there in the
 
04:28:25.750 --> 04:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
public that you can look back at just to
 
04:28:28.070 --> 04:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
see how um homeschool students have
 
04:28:29.670 --> 04:28:29.680 align:start position:0%
traditionally ranked amongst other
 
04:28:31.830 --> 04:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
students across the country all up to
 
04:28:31.840 --> 04:28:32.630 align:start position:0%
students across the country all up to
that

04:28:32.630 --> 04:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:28:35.269 --> 04:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
so how did those studies acquire the
 
04:28:37.670 --> 04:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
information that was collected by
 
04:28:39.750 --> 04:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
private testing companies
 
04:28:41.750 --> 04:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
these testing companies often do ask
 
04:28:41.760 --> 04:28:42.870 align:start position:0%
these testing companies often do ask
students

04:28:42.870 --> 04:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
students
 
04:28:44.309 --> 04:28:44.319 align:start position:0%
what their
 
04:28:46.710 --> 04:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
education model is some public schools
 
04:28:48.710 --> 04:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
do use these nationally recognized tests
 
04:28:51.110 --> 04:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
as well so some of that
 
04:28:52.950 --> 04:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
you do usually give the information that
 
04:28:54.630 --> 04:28:54.640 align:start position:0%
it is either you're at a public school
 
04:28:56.710 --> 04:28:56.720 align:start position:0%

the committee with the with how we can
 
04:29:04.870 --> 04:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
find that information specifically where
 
04:29:07.429 --> 04:29:07.439 align:start position:0%
that information is for
 
04:29:09.830 --> 04:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
school for home school students
 
04:29:11.590 --> 04:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
that take a um
 
04:29:14.870 --> 04:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
a private assessment uh assessment test
 
04:29:16.630 --> 04:29:16.640 align:start position:0%
and how that data can be compared to
 
04:29:18.950 --> 04:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
public school students sure absolutely
 
04:29:21.990 --> 04:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:24.870 --> 04:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
04:29:27.830 --> 04:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
maxine yes represent hobson
 
04:29:29.590 --> 04:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question of
 
04:29:31.510 --> 04:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
sarah scott and thank you for allowing
 
04:29:32.389 --> 04:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
me to
 
04:29:32.399 --> 04:29:33.429 align:start position:0%
me to
um

04:29:33.429 --> 04:29:33.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:36.070 --> 04:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
it was my understanding when the efa
 
04:29:38.389 --> 04:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
program was established that
 
04:29:39.349 --> 04:29:39.359 align:start position:0%
i guess it's going through the
 
04:29:41.670 --> 04:29:41.680 align:start position:0%
children's scholarship fund that we
 
04:29:44.229 --> 04:29:44.239 align:start position:0%
would be able to
 
04:29:47.110 --> 04:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
look at the expenses of maybe audit
 
04:29:49.030 --> 04:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
isn't the right word
 
04:29:51.429 --> 04:29:51.439 align:start position:0%
down to the pencil and i'm wondering is
 
04:29:54.469 --> 04:29:54.479 align:start position:0%
that information available to the public
 
04:29:57.750 --> 04:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
or is that information specific to
 
04:29:59.590 --> 04:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
maybe the department of ed do you know
 
04:30:01.189 --> 04:30:01.199 align:start position:0%
the answer to that question i don't have
 
04:30:03.670 --> 04:30:03.680 align:start position:0%
the answer to that i do believe that the
 
04:30:05.590 --> 04:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
majority of that information is public
 
04:30:07.429 --> 04:30:07.439 align:start position:0%
but i could be wrong on that
 
04:30:12.550 --> 04:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:14.950 --> 04:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
further questions don't see any hands
 
04:30:16.790 --> 04:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:30:18.870 --> 04:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
uh mr southerntown are you going to
 
04:30:20.790 --> 04:30:20.800 align:start position:0%
testify in this one that there's a card
 
04:30:22.710 --> 04:30:22.720 align:start position:0%
up here
 
04:30:22.720 --> 04:30:25.670 align:start position:0%
up here
um

04:30:25.670 --> 04:30:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:27.269 --> 04:30:27.279 align:start position:0%
see that that is
 
04:30:28.550 --> 04:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:30:31.590 --> 04:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
do no you're going to pass on it okay
 
04:30:33.269 --> 04:30:33.279 align:start position:0%

04:30:40.950 --> 04:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
would you believe
 
04:32:33.830 --> 04:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:33.840 --> 04:33:15.830 align:start position:0%

04:33:15.840 --> 04:34:39.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:34:39.830 --> 04:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:39.840 --> 04:35:26.789 align:start position:0%

okay
so

04:36:16.949 --> 04:36:16.959 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:36:19.990 --> 04:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
house bill 1376
 
04:36:20.000 --> 04:36:22.230 align:start position:0%
house bill 1376
um

04:36:22.230 --> 04:36:22.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:24.390 --> 04:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
it's the education freedom accounts and
 
04:36:27.029 --> 04:36:27.039 align:start position:0%
it's the intent of it is to make sure
 
04:36:27.039 --> 04:36:28.150 align:start position:0%
it's the intent of it is to make sure
that

04:36:28.150 --> 04:36:28.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:36:31.269 --> 04:36:31.279 align:start position:0%
parents who place their children in a
 
04:36:34.869 --> 04:36:34.879 align:start position:0%
private school and with taking education
 
04:36:37.269 --> 04:36:37.279 align:start position:0%
freedom accounts know that they waive
 
04:36:39.510 --> 04:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
their special education rights under
 
04:36:39.520 --> 04:36:40.949 align:start position:0%
their special education rights under
idea

04:36:40.949 --> 04:36:40.959 align:start position:0%
idea
 
04:36:44.310 --> 04:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
so the amendment that i put in
 
04:36:48.230 --> 04:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
corrected i had rsa 194
 
04:36:53.189 --> 04:36:53.199 align:start position:0%
dash b colon 4 and it should be 194-f
 
04:36:56.310 --> 04:36:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:58.390 --> 04:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
and what i
 
04:37:00.551 --> 04:37:00.561 align:start position:0%
want to say is that a child
 
04:37:02.869 --> 04:37:02.879 align:start position:0%
participating in a publicly funded
 
04:37:05.429 --> 04:37:05.439 align:start position:0%
education freedom account program
 
04:37:07.349 --> 04:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
forfeits the rights for a free and
 
04:37:10.629 --> 04:37:10.639 align:start position:0%
appropriate education or fape
 
04:37:13.109 --> 04:37:13.119 align:start position:0%
this is because parts participation in a
 
04:37:14.470 --> 04:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
voucher program
 
04:37:17.990 --> 04:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
amounts to a parental placement under 20
 
04:37:24.150 --> 04:37:24.160 align:start position:0%
usc section 1412 small a 10 capital a
 
04:37:24.160 --> 04:37:25.269 align:start position:0%
usc section 1412 small a 10 capital a
presently

04:37:25.269 --> 04:37:25.279 align:start position:0%
presently
 
04:37:25.279 --> 04:37:26.230 align:start position:0%
presently
school

04:37:26.230 --> 04:37:26.240 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:37:29.510 --> 04:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
voucher or efa programs do not always
 
04:37:31.830 --> 04:37:31.840 align:start position:0%
adequately inform parents of the
 
04:37:34.629 --> 04:37:34.639 align:start position:0%
consequence they should receive advance
 
04:37:37.189 --> 04:37:37.199 align:start position:0%
notice of that consequence that a child
 
04:37:38.869 --> 04:37:38.879 align:start position:0%
forfeits the rights to a free and
 
04:37:40.470 --> 04:37:40.480 align:start position:0%
appropriate education while
 
04:37:43.990 --> 04:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
participating in the efa program
 
04:37:46.070 --> 04:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
that's the whole bill that's it that's
 
04:37:47.830 --> 04:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
it thank you very much are there
 
04:37:49.189 --> 04:37:49.199 align:start position:0%
questions for representative cornell
 
04:37:51.029 --> 04:37:51.039 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chairman thank you
representative

04:37:53.429 --> 04:37:53.439 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:37:53.439 --> 04:37:54.551 align:start position:0%
representative
um

04:37:54.551 --> 04:37:54.561 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:58.551 --> 04:37:58.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:58.561 --> 04:37:59.590 align:start position:0%
 
this

04:37:59.590 --> 04:37:59.600 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:38:02.310 --> 04:38:02.320 align:start position:0%
efas are not not vouchers
 
04:38:02.320 --> 04:38:03.189 align:start position:0%
efas are not not vouchers
so

04:38:03.189 --> 04:38:03.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:38:04.949 --> 04:38:04.959 align:start position:0%
there are not
 
04:38:07.269 --> 04:38:07.279 align:start position:0%
there's not a voucher given to a student
 
04:38:08.949 --> 04:38:08.959 align:start position:0%
to attend a particular
 
04:38:11.349 --> 04:38:11.359 align:start position:0%
let's say private school
 
04:38:11.359 --> 04:38:12.709 align:start position:0%
let's say private school
so

04:38:12.709 --> 04:38:12.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:38:14.470 --> 04:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
efa funds
 
04:38:17.349 --> 04:38:17.359 align:start position:0%
can be used for a whole range of options
 
04:38:21.109 --> 04:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:23.429 --> 04:38:23.439 align:start position:0%
private school placement because this
 
04:38:25.910 --> 04:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
bill refers to
 
04:38:28.789 --> 04:38:28.799 align:start position:0%
a parental placement in a private school
 
04:38:30.949 --> 04:38:30.959 align:start position:0%
which does not encompass
 
04:38:33.910 --> 04:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
all efa students
 
04:38:36.830 --> 04:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
so would you see that as an
 
04:38:39.349 --> 04:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
issue i don't think so because i think
 
04:38:41.670 --> 04:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
if a parent places their school in the
 
04:38:44.470 --> 04:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
private program and then uses the efa to
 
04:38:46.070 --> 04:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
pay for part of that
 
04:38:46.080 --> 04:38:47.109 align:start position:0%
pay for part of that
they

04:38:47.109 --> 04:38:47.119 align:start position:0%
they
 
04:38:49.590 --> 04:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
could be giving up their rights um they
 
04:38:51.269 --> 04:38:51.279 align:start position:0%
could be forfeiting their rights to
 
04:38:54.789 --> 04:38:54.799 align:start position:0%
special ed under idea so i think this is
 
04:38:57.830 --> 04:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
just notifying the parents that that may
 
04:38:57.840 --> 04:39:00.230 align:start position:0%
just notifying the parents that that may
happen

04:39:00.230 --> 04:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:01.510 --> 04:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
you follow
 
04:39:04.070 --> 04:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:07.029 --> 04:39:07.039 align:start position:0%
but if they do not place their child in
 
04:39:09.349 --> 04:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
a private school
 
04:39:11.910 --> 04:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
but take a from the list of
 
04:39:14.390 --> 04:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
other educational options
 
04:39:17.429 --> 04:39:17.439 align:start position:0%
um i don't think any of that falls into
 
04:39:19.830 --> 04:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
your bill your bill is assuming doesn't
 
04:39:21.269 --> 04:39:21.279 align:start position:0%
it that
 
04:39:22.869 --> 04:39:22.879 align:start position:0%
all students would be placed in a
 
04:39:35.029 --> 04:39:35.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:36.789 --> 04:39:36.799 align:start position:0%
i think it's just
 
04:39:38.868 --> 04:39:38.878 align:start position:0%
referring to students that are placed in
 
04:39:43.510 --> 04:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:50.868 --> 04:39:50.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:53.270 --> 04:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
and i i think there'll be people someone
 
04:39:55.430 --> 04:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
speaking after me who can address it
 
04:39:57.030 --> 04:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
better than i can
 
04:39:57.040 --> 04:39:57.990 align:start position:0%
better than i can
okay

04:39:57.990 --> 04:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:39:58.000 --> 04:39:58.868 align:start position:0%
okay
um

04:39:58.868 --> 04:39:58.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:58.878 --> 04:39:59.990 align:start position:0%
um
and

04:39:59.990 --> 04:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:40:00.000 --> 04:40:01.190 align:start position:0%
and
um

04:40:01.190 --> 04:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:03.510 --> 04:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
do you think that
 
04:40:03.520 --> 04:40:04.230 align:start position:0%
do you think that
the

04:40:04.230 --> 04:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:40:06.230 --> 04:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
language about waiving
 
04:40:08.310 --> 04:40:08.320 align:start position:0%
rights is correct
 
04:40:09.590 --> 04:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
in that
 
04:40:11.590 --> 04:40:11.600 align:start position:0%
at any point
 
04:40:13.030 --> 04:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
a student
 
04:40:16.550 --> 04:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
could go back into a public school or a
 
04:40:18.550 --> 04:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
public charter school
 
04:40:20.628 --> 04:40:20.638 align:start position:0%
and resume
 
04:40:23.110 --> 04:40:23.120 align:start position:0%
being covered by ida so they're really
 
04:40:23.120 --> 04:40:23.990 align:start position:0%
being covered by ida so they're really
not

04:40:23.990 --> 04:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:40:26.070 --> 04:40:26.080 align:start position:0%
waiving rights
 
04:40:27.750 --> 04:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
they may be waiving their rights while
 
04:40:29.430 --> 04:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
they're in the private school
 
04:40:30.948 --> 04:40:30.958 align:start position:0%
if they went back to the public or the
 
04:40:32.708 --> 04:40:32.718 align:start position:0%
public charter school
 
04:40:34.470 --> 04:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
they would be
 
04:40:36.310 --> 04:40:36.320 align:start position:0%
covered again
 
04:40:37.750 --> 04:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
04:40:37.760 --> 04:40:39.190 align:start position:0%
follow up
but

04:40:39.190 --> 04:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:40:41.510 --> 04:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
children in a private school
 
04:40:44.230 --> 04:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
as you indicate here are covered under
 
04:40:48.390 --> 04:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
uh usc section 1412 etc so they are
 
04:40:52.948 --> 04:40:52.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:56.150 --> 04:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:59.430 --> 04:40:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:59.440 --> 04:41:03.030 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:41:03.030 --> 04:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:03.040 --> 04:41:03.830 align:start position:0%
 
they

04:41:03.830 --> 04:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
they
 
04:41:06.708 --> 04:41:06.718 align:start position:0%
they are not waiving rights under idea
 
04:41:10.070 --> 04:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
because as stated in lines four through
 
04:41:10.080 --> 04:41:12.230 align:start position:0%
because as stated in lines four through
five

04:41:12.230 --> 04:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
five
 
04:41:13.670 --> 04:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
they are covered
 
04:41:15.190 --> 04:41:15.200 align:start position:0%
when they place their student in a
 
04:41:16.868 --> 04:41:16.878 align:start position:0%
private school
 
04:41:16.878 --> 04:41:17.910 align:start position:0%
private school
under

04:41:17.910 --> 04:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
under
 
04:41:24.070 --> 04:41:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:32.948 --> 04:41:32.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:34.708 --> 04:41:34.718 align:start position:0%
is that is that correct
 
04:41:34.718 --> 04:41:35.430 align:start position:0%
is that is that correct
no

04:41:35.430 --> 04:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:41:37.990 --> 04:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
because the way it reads is they receive
 
04:41:40.390 --> 04:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
notice that participation in the efa
 
04:41:43.110 --> 04:41:43.120 align:start position:0%
program is a parental placement under 20
 
04:41:45.750 --> 04:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
usc section
 
04:41:49.910 --> 04:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
1412 individual so they receive if they
 
04:41:51.910 --> 04:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
do place them there they receive notice
 
04:41:53.830 --> 04:41:53.840 align:start position:0%
that participation is a parental
 
04:41:53.840 --> 04:41:55.350 align:start position:0%
that participation is a parental
placement

04:41:55.350 --> 04:41:55.360 align:start position:0%
placement
 
04:41:57.110 --> 04:41:57.120 align:start position:0%
so the parent is placing them in the
 
04:41:58.868 --> 04:41:58.878 align:start position:0%
private school
 
04:42:01.350 --> 04:42:01.360 align:start position:0%
and they may waive their rights to a
 
04:42:05.990 --> 04:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:06.000 --> 04:42:07.510 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:42:07.510 --> 04:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:42:08.868 --> 04:42:08.878 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
04:42:11.270 --> 04:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
04:42:13.670 --> 04:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
is it not true
 
04:42:13.680 --> 04:42:15.270 align:start position:0%
is it not true
that

04:42:15.270 --> 04:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:42:18.070 --> 04:42:18.080 align:start position:0%
there has been concern over
 
04:42:21.430 --> 04:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
parents just assuming that the private
 
04:42:23.270 --> 04:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
school that they placed their child in
 
04:42:26.390 --> 04:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
would pick up their special ed services
 
04:42:28.628 --> 04:42:28.638 align:start position:0%
by virtue of the fact that the student
 
04:42:31.270 --> 04:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
had an iep or a 504 plan when they were
 
04:42:33.190 --> 04:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
in the public school
 
04:42:34.868 --> 04:42:34.878 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:42:38.390 --> 04:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
it does is this bill not in response to
 
04:42:40.470 --> 04:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
that that parents thought that the kids
 
04:42:42.868 --> 04:42:42.878 align:start position:0%
were going to receive services when
 
04:42:45.750 --> 04:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
they weren't going to because it was
 
04:42:48.708 --> 04:42:48.718 align:start position:0%
a unilateral decision
 
04:42:48.718 --> 04:42:52.868 align:start position:0%
a unilateral decision
yes

04:42:52.868 --> 04:42:52.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:54.390 --> 04:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
04:42:56.390 --> 04:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
represent tanner
 
04:42:58.868 --> 04:42:58.878 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you for taking my question
 
04:43:00.788 --> 04:43:00.798 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering about
 
04:43:04.070 --> 04:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
schools like prenda and also uh schools
 
04:43:06.470 --> 04:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
that are only for tuition purposes only
 
04:43:09.830 --> 04:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
uh if if some if a parent had took an
 
04:43:12.070 --> 04:43:12.080 align:start position:0%
efa and placed their student in one of
 
04:43:13.270 --> 04:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
those two
 
04:43:14.550 --> 04:43:14.560 align:start position:0%
uh groups
 
04:43:17.750 --> 04:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh would they then waive their right for
 
04:43:23.110 --> 04:43:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:26.788 --> 04:43:26.798 align:start position:0%
prenda is the the third part yeah
 
04:43:28.628 --> 04:43:28.638 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm not sure about printed because
 
04:43:30.708 --> 04:43:30.718 align:start position:0%
i i really don't know enough about the
 
04:43:32.390 --> 04:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
rules of prenda but
 
04:43:32.400 --> 04:43:33.990 align:start position:0%
rules of prenda but
um

04:43:33.990 --> 04:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:35.270 --> 04:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
i i think
 
04:43:36.948 --> 04:43:36.958 align:start position:0%
basically it's the private school that
 
04:43:38.628 --> 04:43:38.638 align:start position:0%
they're placed into so if prenda is
 
04:43:41.910 --> 04:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
considered a private school under these
 
04:43:41.920 --> 04:43:42.948 align:start position:0%
considered a private school under these
rules

04:43:42.948 --> 04:43:42.958 align:start position:0%
rules
 
04:43:46.948 --> 04:43:46.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:49.030 --> 04:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
rep san luna thank you very much mr
 
04:43:51.270 --> 04:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
chair is the um
 
04:43:53.110 --> 04:43:53.120 align:start position:0%
representative cornell is the intent of
 
04:43:54.310 --> 04:43:54.320 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:43:57.830 --> 04:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
to make um like a material change to the
 
04:44:01.270 --> 04:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
to the efa program or is it to provide
 
04:44:05.430 --> 04:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
clarity and transparency so that
 
04:44:09.190 --> 04:44:09.200 align:start position:0%
families know what they're getting into
 
04:44:11.510 --> 04:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
it's simply to provide clarity that
 
04:44:13.430 --> 04:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
parents realize when they're placing
 
04:44:15.110 --> 04:44:15.120 align:start position:0%
their child in the school they may be
 
04:44:17.270 --> 04:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
giving up their rights to a free and
 
04:44:22.550 --> 04:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:24.788 --> 04:44:24.798 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
04:44:32.310 --> 04:44:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:54.470 --> 04:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:56.628 --> 04:44:56.638 align:start position:0%
uh bonnie can you turn the red light on
 
04:44:58.470 --> 04:44:58.480 align:start position:0%
press the button
 
04:45:00.310 --> 04:45:00.320 align:start position:0%
okay yes thank you
 
04:45:03.270 --> 04:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
apparently no i could not um so
 
04:45:05.910 --> 04:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
thank you um i'm here in support of this
 
04:45:08.708 --> 04:45:08.718 align:start position:0%
bill and i appreciate so much the
 
04:45:10.788 --> 04:45:10.798 align:start position:0%
sponsors introducing it
 
04:45:12.628 --> 04:45:12.638 align:start position:0%
and then providing additional clarity
 
04:45:14.390 --> 04:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
through the amendment that they've
 
04:45:14.400 --> 04:45:16.310 align:start position:0%
through the amendment that they've
proposed

04:45:16.310 --> 04:45:16.320 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
04:45:18.310 --> 04:45:18.320 align:start position:0%
i think that this bill will help to
 
04:45:19.990 --> 04:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
ensure that parents of students with
 
04:45:22.708 --> 04:45:22.718 align:start position:0%
disabilities who choose to enroll in the
 
04:45:25.270 --> 04:45:25.280 align:start position:0%
efa program do so with a clear
 
04:45:27.270 --> 04:45:27.280 align:start position:0%
understanding of how that participation
 
04:45:28.948 --> 04:45:28.958 align:start position:0%
will affect their child's rights under
 
04:45:28.958 --> 04:45:30.788 align:start position:0%
will affect their child's rights under
idea

04:45:30.788 --> 04:45:30.798 align:start position:0%
idea
 
04:45:32.470 --> 04:45:32.480 align:start position:0%
if a parent enrolls their child with a
 
04:45:35.030 --> 04:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
disability who has an efa in a public or
 
04:45:37.030 --> 04:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
private nonprofit elementary or
 
04:45:38.788 --> 04:45:38.798 align:start position:0%
secondary school that meets the
 
04:45:41.030 --> 04:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
definition established by the state
 
04:45:42.708 --> 04:45:42.718 align:start position:0%
then that child is considered to be a
 
04:45:44.550 --> 04:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
parentally placed private school child
 
04:45:46.470 --> 04:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
with a disability
 
04:45:48.868 --> 04:45:48.878 align:start position:0%
if the parent places their child in a
 
04:45:51.430 --> 04:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
for-profit private school or homeschools
 
04:45:52.628 --> 04:45:52.638 align:start position:0%
their child
 
04:45:55.110 --> 04:45:55.120 align:start position:0%
or in any setting that is not does not
 
04:45:57.110 --> 04:45:57.120 align:start position:0%
meet the definition of an elementary or
 
04:45:58.868 --> 04:45:58.878 align:start position:0%
secondary school
 
04:46:02.230 --> 04:46:02.240 align:start position:0%
under state law then that child is not a
 
04:46:03.990 --> 04:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
parentally placed private school child
 
04:46:06.310 --> 04:46:06.320 align:start position:0%
with a disability they're just a child
 
04:46:08.310 --> 04:46:08.320 align:start position:0%
with a disability
 
04:46:11.190 --> 04:46:11.200 align:start position:0%
the child who is in a for-profit private
 
04:46:13.430 --> 04:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
school or is homeschooled because they
 
04:46:15.110 --> 04:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
are not a parentally placed private
 
04:46:17.350 --> 04:46:17.360 align:start position:0%
school child with a disability has no
 
04:46:20.550 --> 04:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
right to special education at all the
 
04:46:22.550 --> 04:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
parentally placed private school child
 
04:46:24.310 --> 04:46:24.320 align:start position:0%
which is a child who was placed by their
 
04:46:26.470 --> 04:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
parent in a non-profit
 
04:46:28.390 --> 04:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
public or private elementary or
 
04:46:30.550 --> 04:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
secondary school
 
04:46:32.628 --> 04:46:32.638 align:start position:0%
does have some
 
04:46:34.708 --> 04:46:34.718 align:start position:0%
group right to
 
04:46:37.190 --> 04:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
a free appropriate public education or
 
04:46:39.750 --> 04:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
to some services under idea
 
04:46:41.270 --> 04:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
and that's because
 
04:46:43.670 --> 04:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
of the equitable services requirement in
 
04:46:46.948 --> 04:46:46.958 align:start position:0%
idea and that requirement says that the
 
04:46:49.590 --> 04:46:49.600 align:start position:0%
school district the lea must spend an
 
04:46:51.350 --> 04:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
amount proportionate to the amount of
 
04:46:54.230 --> 04:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
idea funds or the federal funds the lea
 
04:46:55.990 --> 04:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
receives for the group of parentally
 
04:46:58.070 --> 04:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
placed private school students with
 
04:47:00.230 --> 04:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
disabilities attending private
 
04:47:02.070 --> 04:47:02.080 align:start position:0%
elementary or secondary schools in the
 
04:47:04.150 --> 04:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
school district served by the lea
 
04:47:07.110 --> 04:47:07.120 align:start position:0%
so whatever amount of federal funds that
 
04:47:09.030 --> 04:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
the school district gets for that group
 
04:47:10.948 --> 04:47:10.958 align:start position:0%
of students they must spend on that
 
04:47:13.270 --> 04:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
group of students
 
04:47:15.990 --> 04:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
but only if that child is in a placement
 
04:47:17.590 --> 04:47:17.600 align:start position:0%
that meets the definition of an
 
04:47:19.590 --> 04:47:19.600 align:start position:0%
elementary or secondary school which
 
04:47:21.990 --> 04:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
means a non-profit elementary or
 
04:47:23.750 --> 04:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
secondary school public or private
 
04:47:25.190 --> 04:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter
 
04:47:27.670 --> 04:47:27.680 align:start position:0%
because children who are not parentally
 
04:47:29.030 --> 04:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
placed private school children with
 
04:47:29.040 --> 04:47:32.550 align:start position:0%
placed private school children with
disabilities

04:47:32.550 --> 04:47:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:35.510 --> 04:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
if they are in a not in a for-profit or
 
04:47:38.708 --> 04:47:38.718 align:start position:0%
are in a homeschool situation the lea
 
04:47:40.708 --> 04:47:40.718 align:start position:0%
does not receive any idea funds for
 
04:47:43.430 --> 04:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
those students so the equitable
 
04:47:45.270 --> 04:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
calculation the calculation for the
 
04:47:46.868 --> 04:47:46.878 align:start position:0%
proportionate share of equitable
 
04:47:49.350 --> 04:47:49.360 align:start position:0%
services is not applicable you can't
 
04:47:52.390 --> 04:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
have an equitable proportion of money
 
04:47:54.788 --> 04:47:54.798 align:start position:0%
that doesn't exist
 
04:47:57.270 --> 04:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
i guess zero of zero is zero the lea
 
04:47:59.270 --> 04:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
does continue for all of those children
 
04:48:00.788 --> 04:48:00.798 align:start position:0%
for every child
 
04:48:02.390 --> 04:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
with a disability who is in their
 
04:48:03.910 --> 04:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
catchment area
 
04:48:05.830 --> 04:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
they're still responsible for child find
 
04:48:07.910 --> 04:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
activities and so a parent can make an
 
04:48:09.510 --> 04:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
initial referral
 
04:48:12.070 --> 04:48:12.080 align:start position:0%
if their child had an iep and then they
 
04:48:14.948 --> 04:48:14.958 align:start position:0%
choose to re rejoin the public system
 
04:48:17.430 --> 04:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
they can again have their child be found
 
04:48:19.830 --> 04:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
eligible for special education and all
 
04:48:21.830 --> 04:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
of the rights remain intact
 
04:48:23.670 --> 04:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
for that child once they are determined
 
04:48:25.590 --> 04:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
to con that they continue to be a child
 
04:48:27.350 --> 04:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
with a disability
 
04:48:29.910 --> 04:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
and they are in that public system
 
04:48:31.750 --> 04:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
so the distinction between a child with
 
04:48:33.510 --> 04:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
a disability
 
04:48:35.670 --> 04:48:35.680 align:start position:0%
who is and who is not considered to be a
 
04:48:37.350 --> 04:48:37.360 align:start position:0%
parentally placed private school child
 
04:48:39.830 --> 04:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
with a disability can be confusing and
 
04:48:42.470 --> 04:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
that was in the original statute so this
 
04:48:44.550 --> 04:48:44.560 align:start position:0%
this amendment um
 
04:48:46.390 --> 04:48:46.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't doesn't confuse doesn't
 
04:48:48.628 --> 04:48:48.638 align:start position:0%
conflagrate those those that was already
 
04:48:50.948 --> 04:48:50.958 align:start position:0%
um confusing in the original statute
 
04:48:53.990 --> 04:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
that was passed a couple of years ago
 
04:48:55.750 --> 04:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
because those those are two separate
 
04:48:57.910 --> 04:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
situations children who are and children
 
04:48:59.590 --> 04:48:59.600 align:start position:0%
who are not parentally placed private
 
04:49:01.750 --> 04:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
school children with a disability so
 
04:49:03.910 --> 04:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
because it's confusing it's really
 
04:49:05.510 --> 04:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
really important that parents of
 
04:49:07.430 --> 04:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
children with disabilities regardless of
 
04:49:09.190 --> 04:49:09.200 align:start position:0%
where they're going to be placing them
 
04:49:11.670 --> 04:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
if they have an efa have a clear
 
04:49:13.430 --> 04:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
understanding get a clear and
 
04:49:16.470 --> 04:49:16.480 align:start position:0%
user-friendly explanation of what rights
 
04:49:19.110 --> 04:49:19.120 align:start position:0%
under idea they will no longer have and
 
04:49:21.670 --> 04:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
what rights they they may still have
 
04:49:23.910 --> 04:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
i because of the confusing nature of
 
04:49:26.390 --> 04:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
that i do hope that the department of
 
04:49:26.400 --> 04:49:27.670 align:start position:0%
that i do hope that the department of
education

04:49:27.670 --> 04:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
education
 
04:49:30.390 --> 04:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
is given the authority to either
 
04:49:33.510 --> 04:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
write or approve whatever explanation is
 
04:49:35.190 --> 04:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
developed that is provided to those
 
04:49:37.990 --> 04:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
parents thank you
 
04:49:40.310 --> 04:49:40.320 align:start position:0%
are there questions for
 
04:49:42.070 --> 04:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
bonnie dunham
 
04:49:43.510 --> 04:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli
 
04:49:47.270 --> 04:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for being here um
 
04:49:48.310 --> 04:49:48.320 align:start position:0%
so just
 
04:49:50.390 --> 04:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
um going back to my original line of
 
04:49:50.400 --> 04:49:53.030 align:start position:0%
um going back to my original line of
questioning

04:49:53.030 --> 04:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:56.788 --> 04:49:56.798 align:start position:0%
a child with an efa who was placed in a
 
04:49:59.910 --> 04:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
non-public school according to law
 
04:50:02.550 --> 04:50:02.560 align:start position:0%
is still covered by idea
 
04:50:04.310 --> 04:50:04.320 align:start position:0%
but a different portion a different
 
04:50:07.110 --> 04:50:07.120 align:start position:0%
section of idea as as if they had been
 
04:50:09.430 --> 04:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
in a public school is that correct
 
04:50:11.670 --> 04:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
a child who was in a private school is
 
04:50:13.190 --> 04:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
considered to be a parentally placed
 
04:50:15.110 --> 04:50:15.120 align:start position:0%
private school child if that private
 
04:50:17.430 --> 04:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
school is a non-profit elementary or
 
04:50:17.440 --> 04:50:18.470 align:start position:0%
school is a non-profit elementary or
secondary

04:50:18.470 --> 04:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
secondary
 
04:50:20.628 --> 04:50:20.638 align:start position:0%
school if it is not they are not the
 
04:50:22.788 --> 04:50:22.798 align:start position:0%
section of idea that
 
04:50:22.798 --> 04:50:23.670 align:start position:0%
section of idea that
that

04:50:23.670 --> 04:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:50:25.590 --> 04:50:25.600 align:start position:0%
applies to those student is the one that
 
04:50:27.830 --> 04:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
explains how school districts do not
 
04:50:29.910 --> 04:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
have to use state or local funds to pay
 
04:50:32.470 --> 04:50:32.480 align:start position:0%
for it so it's a particular section and
 
04:50:34.948 --> 04:50:34.958 align:start position:0%
in fact in the regulations they clarify
 
04:50:36.868 --> 04:50:36.878 align:start position:0%
that by saying
 
04:50:36.878 --> 04:50:37.830 align:start position:0%
that by saying
that

04:50:37.830 --> 04:50:37.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:50:39.590 --> 04:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
no parentally placed private school
 
04:50:41.190 --> 04:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
child with a disability has an
 
04:50:43.430 --> 04:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
individual right to receive some or all
 
04:50:45.590 --> 04:50:45.600 align:start position:0%
of the special education and related
 
04:50:47.430 --> 04:50:47.440 align:start position:0%
services that the child would receive if
 
04:50:50.628 --> 04:50:50.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:53.270 --> 04:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
go follow up
 
04:50:53.280 --> 04:50:54.230 align:start position:0%
go follow up
so

04:50:54.230 --> 04:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:50:56.550 --> 04:50:56.560 align:start position:0%
if they are
 
04:50:58.390 --> 04:50:58.400 align:start position:0%
getting an efa and placed in a
 
04:51:00.310 --> 04:51:00.320 align:start position:0%
non-public school by their parent they
 
04:51:03.590 --> 04:51:03.600 align:start position:0%
are still covered by ida is that correct
 
04:51:06.708 --> 04:51:06.718 align:start position:0%
is it a non is it a non-profit yes it's
 
04:51:08.708 --> 04:51:08.718 align:start position:0%
an approved non-public school by the
 
04:51:09.990 --> 04:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
state then they are covered by the
 
04:51:11.990 --> 04:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
section of idea that says they have no
 
04:51:17.190 --> 04:51:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:17.200 --> 04:51:18.150 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:51:18.150 --> 04:51:18.160 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:51:19.830 --> 04:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
no individual
 
04:51:19.840 --> 04:51:20.628 align:start position:0%
no individual
okay

04:51:20.628 --> 04:51:20.638 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:51:22.310 --> 04:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
that gets into the whole how you
 
04:51:25.910 --> 04:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
calculate what percentage of funds uh
 
04:51:29.270 --> 04:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
title one funds that the uh
 
04:51:31.030 --> 04:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
non-public school will receive to
 
04:51:33.270 --> 04:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
provide services for that child under an
 
04:51:35.270 --> 04:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
individual service plan
 
04:51:37.430 --> 04:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
so if they're is that correct
 
04:51:39.270 --> 04:51:39.280 align:start position:0%
sort of if there are ten students with
 
04:51:41.590 --> 04:51:41.600 align:start position:0%
disabilities enrolled in a private
 
04:51:41.600 --> 04:51:42.550 align:start position:0%
disabilities enrolled in a private
school

04:51:42.550 --> 04:51:42.560 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:51:44.230 --> 04:51:44.240 align:start position:0%
then the school that in the school
 
04:51:46.150 --> 04:51:46.160 align:start position:0%
district would have to use the funds
 
04:51:48.150 --> 04:51:48.160 align:start position:0%
that came in for those 10 students on
 
04:51:50.550 --> 04:51:50.560 align:start position:0%
those 10 students but if nine of those
 
04:51:52.390 --> 04:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
students need reading help then the
 
04:51:54.150 --> 04:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
school district could choose to spend
 
04:51:56.470 --> 04:51:56.480 align:start position:0%
all of the money on a reading specialist
 
04:51:58.708 --> 04:51:58.718 align:start position:0%
to support those children on a part-time
 
04:52:00.868 --> 04:52:00.878 align:start position:0%
basis the one child who does not need
 
04:52:02.550 --> 04:52:02.560 align:start position:0%
reading support even though they are a
 
04:52:04.708 --> 04:52:04.718 align:start position:0%
child with a disability may get no
 
04:52:10.310 --> 04:52:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:10.320 --> 04:52:11.750 align:start position:0%
 
further

04:52:11.750 --> 04:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
further
 
04:52:11.760 --> 04:52:13.270 align:start position:0%
further
so

04:52:13.270 --> 04:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:52:14.868 --> 04:52:14.878 align:start position:0%
if they're all 10 students are in a
 
04:52:17.430 --> 04:52:17.440 align:start position:0%
public school
 
04:52:18.948 --> 04:52:18.958 align:start position:0%
and the school
 
04:52:22.390 --> 04:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
chooses to give reading services
 
04:52:25.670 --> 04:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
to nine children all using up all those
 
04:52:25.680 --> 04:52:26.708 align:start position:0%
to nine children all using up all those
funds

04:52:26.708 --> 04:52:26.718 align:start position:0%
funds
 
04:52:29.590 --> 04:52:29.600 align:start position:0%
the one child in the public school
 
04:52:31.670 --> 04:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
who has needs
 
04:52:34.390 --> 04:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:36.550 --> 04:52:36.560 align:start position:0%
eliminated from receiving any special
 
04:52:39.270 --> 04:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
needs funds did you mean to say public
 
04:52:41.830 --> 04:52:41.840 align:start position:0%
school no private right in
 
04:52:43.270 --> 04:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
a public in excuse me in a pro
 
04:52:44.708 --> 04:52:44.718 align:start position:0%
non-public school
 
04:52:46.788 --> 04:52:46.798 align:start position:0%
yes yes they are not entitled to the
 
04:52:49.030 --> 04:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
school district has to engage in
 
04:52:50.948 --> 04:52:50.958 align:start position:0%
meaningful and timely consultation with
 
04:52:52.708 --> 04:52:52.718 align:start position:0%
the private schools so that they can
 
04:52:53.750 --> 04:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
make a
 
04:52:55.990 --> 04:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
decision about how they can best expend
 
04:52:57.510 --> 04:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
those funds and my
 
04:52:59.270 --> 04:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
understanding is that they do their best
 
04:53:02.550 --> 04:53:02.560 align:start position:0%
to give children something but if
 
04:53:05.030 --> 04:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
financially and and consulting with
 
04:53:07.270 --> 04:53:07.280 align:start position:0%
everyone it turns out that that is
 
04:53:10.150 --> 04:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
that the way to best use those funds is
 
04:53:11.910 --> 04:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
that one child will be left out yes one
 
04:53:13.510 --> 04:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
child would be left out
 
04:53:17.350 --> 04:53:17.360 align:start position:0%
so your position is in looking at idea
 
04:53:18.830 --> 04:53:18.840 align:start position:0%
that the public
 
04:53:21.910 --> 04:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
school district does not have to provide
 
04:53:25.990 --> 04:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
funds under idea to that child in a
 
04:53:27.670 --> 04:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
non-public school
 
04:53:29.430 --> 04:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
that has a service plan that has been
 
04:53:31.350 --> 04:53:31.360 align:start position:0%
agreed to they wouldn't have a service
 
04:53:33.430 --> 04:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
plan a service plan is only for those
 
04:53:35.670 --> 04:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
students who through me timely and
 
04:53:37.270 --> 04:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
meaningful consultation the school
 
04:53:40.868 --> 04:53:40.878 align:start position:0%
district decides to expend funds on idea
 
04:53:43.030 --> 04:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
funds on the children who do not get
 
04:53:45.590 --> 04:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
services do not have a services plan i
 
04:53:48.390 --> 04:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
provided the entire section of idea in
 
04:53:50.150 --> 04:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
my written testimony where you can read
 
04:53:50.160 --> 04:53:54.070 align:start position:0%
my written testimony where you can read
that

04:53:54.070 --> 04:53:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:56.150 --> 04:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
04:53:57.670 --> 04:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
representative porter
 
04:53:59.350 --> 04:53:59.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair and thank
 
04:54:01.830 --> 04:54:01.840 align:start position:0%
you bonnie for taking my question i
 
04:54:03.510 --> 04:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
really want to thank you for what you
 
04:54:06.788 --> 04:54:06.798 align:start position:0%
sent to us um it helped to help me to
 
04:54:08.948 --> 04:54:08.958 align:start position:0%
understand what was going on here
 
04:54:12.708 --> 04:54:12.718 align:start position:0%
so let me see if if i've got it right
 
04:54:15.110 --> 04:54:15.120 align:start position:0%
the federal government sends school
 
04:54:17.190 --> 04:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
districts money
 
04:54:18.868 --> 04:54:18.878 align:start position:0%
for their
 
04:54:20.868 --> 04:54:20.878 align:start position:0%
idea kids
 
04:54:20.878 --> 04:54:21.830 align:start position:0%
idea kids
okay

04:54:21.830 --> 04:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:54:24.628 --> 04:54:24.638 align:start position:0%
if 10 of those kids
 
04:54:28.470 --> 04:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
go to a private school
 
04:54:31.590 --> 04:54:31.600 align:start position:0%
this the prac the public school takes
 
04:54:34.470 --> 04:54:34.480 align:start position:0%
the money for those 10 kids and can use
 
04:54:36.150 --> 04:54:36.160 align:start position:0%
and shares it out with those kids that
 
04:54:38.708 --> 04:54:38.718 align:start position:0%
are in the private school is that right
 
04:54:40.708 --> 04:54:40.718 align:start position:0%
they spend it on that group of students
 
04:54:42.948 --> 04:54:42.958 align:start position:0%
it's a little more complicated because
 
04:54:44.708 --> 04:54:44.718 align:start position:0%
the school district that gets those
 
04:54:46.470 --> 04:54:46.480 align:start position:0%
funds is the school district in which
 
04:54:48.390 --> 04:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
the private school is located it has
 
04:54:50.230 --> 04:54:50.240 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with where the child lives
 
04:54:53.270 --> 04:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
the child could live in
 
04:54:55.350 --> 04:54:55.360 align:start position:0%
san francisco and be attending a school
 
04:54:57.270 --> 04:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire or private school
 
04:54:58.788 --> 04:54:58.798 align:start position:0%
and the school district where the
 
04:55:00.550 --> 04:55:00.560 align:start position:0%
private school is located would get the
 
04:55:03.670 --> 04:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
idea funds for that child they really
 
04:55:05.110 --> 04:55:05.120 align:start position:0%
complicated it the last time they
 
04:55:08.150 --> 04:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
revised idea so can i have a follow-up
 
04:55:10.788 --> 04:55:10.798 align:start position:0%
then so the public school the kids who
 
04:55:15.510 --> 04:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:19.510 --> 04:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
the cost of those services to those kids
 
04:55:21.030 --> 04:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
over and above what the federal
 
04:55:23.110 --> 04:55:23.120 align:start position:0%
government sends is what's absorbed by
 
04:55:26.310 --> 04:55:26.320 align:start position:0%
the local taxpayers and by the state yes
 
04:55:28.708 --> 04:55:28.718 align:start position:0%
so once those kids are out of the public
 
04:55:28.718 --> 04:55:30.150 align:start position:0%
so once those kids are out of the public
school

04:55:30.150 --> 04:55:30.160 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:55:30.160 --> 04:55:31.110 align:start position:0%
school
under

04:55:31.110 --> 04:55:31.120 align:start position:0%
under
 
04:55:32.628 --> 04:55:32.638 align:start position:0%
the idea
 
04:55:32.638 --> 04:55:33.910 align:start position:0%
the idea
law

04:55:33.910 --> 04:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
law
 
04:55:35.750 --> 04:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
they are no longer
 
04:55:38.868 --> 04:55:38.878 align:start position:0%
public schools are no longer required to
 
04:55:40.708 --> 04:55:40.718 align:start position:0%
use their
 
04:55:43.830 --> 04:55:43.840 align:start position:0%
property tax money and the state money
 
04:55:45.830 --> 04:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
to fund the services for the kids in the
 
04:55:47.350 --> 04:55:47.360 align:start position:0%
private school
 
04:55:49.430 --> 04:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
the only thing they're responsible for
 
04:55:51.670 --> 04:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
is the money that comes from the feds
 
04:55:55.430 --> 04:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
yes is that right thank you very much
 
04:55:56.948 --> 04:55:56.958 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
04:55:58.550 --> 04:55:58.560 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
04:56:02.868 --> 04:56:02.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:04.390 --> 04:56:04.400 align:start position:0%
go ahead thank you bonnie for coming
 
04:56:06.070 --> 04:56:06.080 align:start position:0%
because you're really making a lot of
 
04:56:09.910 --> 04:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
this clear to us and i still have
 
04:56:11.510 --> 04:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
in trying to understand this you've
 
04:56:13.350 --> 04:56:13.360 align:start position:0%
explained the private schools very well
 
04:56:16.390 --> 04:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
and i think i get what's going on there
 
04:56:19.350 --> 04:56:19.360 align:start position:0%
what if a parent places a student in
 
04:56:21.830 --> 04:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
another public school that's not in
 
04:56:24.868 --> 04:56:24.878 align:start position:0%
their district what happens in that case
 
04:56:27.030 --> 04:56:27.040 align:start position:0%
it all it's all based on whether or not
 
04:56:29.590 --> 04:56:29.600 align:start position:0%
the school is considered to be
 
04:56:29.600 --> 04:56:30.628 align:start position:0%
the school is considered to be
a

04:56:30.628 --> 04:56:30.638 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:56:32.628 --> 04:56:32.638 align:start position:0%
an elementary or secondary school under
 
04:56:35.190 --> 04:56:35.200 align:start position:0%
idea new hampshire may have some wanky
 
04:56:38.470 --> 04:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
things that i'm not aware of where
 
04:56:40.310 --> 04:56:40.320 align:start position:0%
they may decide that placement in a
 
04:56:41.510 --> 04:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
public school would carry some
 
04:56:43.270 --> 04:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
additional pieces just like a parent
 
04:56:45.270 --> 04:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
could tuition a child to a public school
 
04:56:47.590 --> 04:56:47.600 align:start position:0%
another public school
 
04:56:49.270 --> 04:56:49.280 align:start position:0%
and through an arrangement that's made
 
04:56:51.030 --> 04:56:51.040 align:start position:0%
and i'm really not sure
 
04:56:53.430 --> 04:56:53.440 align:start position:0%
i don't think that this statute is clear
 
04:56:55.110 --> 04:56:55.120 align:start position:0%
enough on that issue
 
04:56:56.470 --> 04:56:56.480 align:start position:0%
for me to be able to answer that
 
04:56:56.480 --> 04:56:57.670 align:start position:0%
for me to be able to answer that
question

04:56:57.670 --> 04:56:57.680 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:56:59.510 --> 04:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that it
 
04:57:01.430 --> 04:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
would be treated as if they placed them
 
04:57:01.440 --> 04:57:02.150 align:start position:0%
would be treated as if they placed them
in

04:57:02.150 --> 04:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:57:03.830 --> 04:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
you know they made a unilateral
 
04:57:03.840 --> 04:57:04.948 align:start position:0%
you know they made a unilateral
placement

04:57:04.948 --> 04:57:04.958 align:start position:0%
placement
 
04:57:07.350 --> 04:57:07.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:57:08.550 --> 04:57:08.560 align:start position:0%
i think that has to be looked at a
 
04:57:11.750 --> 04:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
little bit it does i think i i'm saying
 
04:57:13.030 --> 04:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
i think we're
 
04:57:15.430 --> 04:57:15.440 align:start position:0%
not interpreting it maybe the way does
 
04:57:19.510 --> 04:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
interpreting it right now or as an efa
 
04:57:19.520 --> 04:57:20.310 align:start position:0%
interpreting it right now or as an efa
that

04:57:20.310 --> 04:57:20.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:57:23.430 --> 04:57:23.440 align:start position:0%
fourth leg of the stool
 
04:57:26.150 --> 04:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
um there's you know more to the story
 
04:57:28.550 --> 04:57:28.560 align:start position:0%
than we're getting at right here right
 
04:57:30.230 --> 04:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
yes and the u.s department of ed through
 
04:57:31.910 --> 04:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
their office of special ed programs
 
04:57:35.030 --> 04:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
keeps issuing guidance on this issue and
 
04:57:37.110 --> 04:57:37.120 align:start position:0%
many issues because
 
04:57:38.708 --> 04:57:38.718 align:start position:0%
some things are not clear enough in the
 
04:57:40.628 --> 04:57:40.638 align:start position:0%
beginning and the work needs to be done
 
04:57:42.550 --> 04:57:42.560 align:start position:0%
to make them more clear
 
04:57:44.708 --> 04:57:44.718 align:start position:0%
representative luna thank you very much
 
04:57:46.708 --> 04:57:46.718 align:start position:0%
mr chair and thank you very much miss
 
04:57:49.030 --> 04:57:49.040 align:start position:0%
tom but but would you would you say
 
04:57:51.030 --> 04:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
though that the language that's been
 
04:57:53.190 --> 04:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
provided here and
 
04:57:54.708 --> 04:57:54.718 align:start position:0%
particularly in the amendment that was
 
04:57:56.628 --> 04:57:56.638 align:start position:0%
handed out for 39
 
04:57:58.868 --> 04:57:58.878 align:start position:0%
um uh doesn't
 
04:57:58.878 --> 04:58:00.550 align:start position:0%
um uh doesn't
um

04:58:00.550 --> 04:58:00.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:03.670 --> 04:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't change the responsibility that
 
04:58:06.390 --> 04:58:06.400 align:start position:0%
that public or private
 
04:58:08.310 --> 04:58:08.320 align:start position:0%
schools have or that the federal
 
04:58:11.590 --> 04:58:11.600 align:start position:0%
government has but clarifies uh
 
04:58:14.708 --> 04:58:14.718 align:start position:0%
substantially over what is in current
 
04:58:18.070 --> 04:58:18.080 align:start position:0%
law yes it doesn't change any of the
 
04:58:20.070 --> 04:58:20.080 align:start position:0%
of the responsibilities of the school
 
04:58:23.030 --> 04:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
district or the rights of the parents it
 
04:58:25.030 --> 04:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
just makes sure that they are aware of
 
04:58:27.430 --> 04:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
what those rights are what rights they
 
04:58:29.990 --> 04:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
retain and what rights they don't retain
 
04:58:31.990 --> 04:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
and how that whole process would work
 
04:58:34.150 --> 04:58:34.160 align:start position:0%
you know how a school district would
 
04:58:36.310 --> 04:58:36.320 align:start position:0%
decide how to spend that federal
 
04:58:38.550 --> 04:58:38.560 align:start position:0%
money on that group of students because
 
04:58:42.948 --> 04:58:42.958 align:start position:0%
it really is a confusing thing
 
04:58:45.270 --> 04:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
represent porter thank you and i don't
 
04:58:47.110 --> 04:58:47.120 align:start position:0%
mean to put you on the spot bonnie book
 
04:58:48.708 --> 04:58:48.718 align:start position:0%
can you give us
 
04:58:49.910 --> 04:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
why do you know all this good
 
04:58:51.590 --> 04:58:51.600 align:start position:0%
information you have
 
04:58:54.390 --> 04:58:54.400 align:start position:0%
an organization that you're representing
 
04:58:56.070 --> 04:58:56.080 align:start position:0%
i work at the parent information center
 
04:58:58.150 --> 04:58:58.160 align:start position:0%
i'm here as a private citizen because as
 
04:59:00.948 --> 04:59:00.958 align:start position:0%
a parent of a child with a disability
 
04:59:03.030 --> 04:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
we all find each other and so i know a
 
04:59:04.390 --> 04:59:04.400 align:start position:0%
lot of other parents of children with
 
04:59:06.310 --> 04:59:06.320 align:start position:0%
disabilities some who have chosen to
 
04:59:07.990 --> 04:59:08.000 align:start position:0%
homeschool their children
 
04:59:09.510 --> 04:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
some who have chosen to place them
 
04:59:11.910 --> 04:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
privately with or with with
 
04:59:13.270 --> 04:59:13.280 align:start position:0%
through the school district and some
 
04:59:16.390 --> 04:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
unilaterally um and i
 
04:59:19.750 --> 04:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
am aware of just how often parents
 
04:59:21.990 --> 04:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
make decisions based on incomplete or
 
04:59:24.230 --> 04:59:24.240 align:start position:0%
inaccurate information
 
04:59:26.470 --> 04:59:26.480 align:start position:0%
and then end up being sorry and having
 
04:59:28.868 --> 04:59:28.878 align:start position:0%
to go back and fix what problem has been
 
04:59:31.830 --> 04:59:31.840 align:start position:0%
created and so i just feel very strongly
 
04:59:33.990 --> 04:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
as a parent that parents need to have
 
04:59:36.310 --> 04:59:36.320 align:start position:0%
accurate information so they can make
 
04:59:38.470 --> 04:59:38.480 align:start position:0%
informed decisions whatever those
 
04:59:40.470 --> 04:59:40.480 align:start position:0%
decisions may be i might disagree but
 
04:59:43.590 --> 04:59:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:45.830 --> 04:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
bonnie has worked with special education
 
04:59:47.750 --> 04:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
ever since i can remember
 
04:59:49.830 --> 04:59:49.840 align:start position:0%
and on task force now i can just
 
04:59:51.030 --> 04:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
remember all the times we've worked
 
04:59:52.708 --> 04:59:52.718 align:start position:0%
together bonnie and this so her
 
04:59:54.070 --> 04:59:54.080 align:start position:0%
expertise is
 
04:59:55.670 --> 04:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
it goes down deep
 
04:59:57.990 --> 04:59:58.000 align:start position:0%
my son was born with a disability 41
 
05:00:00.868 --> 05:00:00.878 align:start position:0%
years ago and when he was two i started
 
05:00:03.670 --> 05:00:03.680 align:start position:0%
taking classes and i hung out so often
 
05:00:05.270 --> 05:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
at those classes that one day they said
 
05:00:07.110 --> 05:00:07.120 align:start position:0%
do you want to stay we'll pay you and i
 
05:00:10.470 --> 05:00:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:12.470 --> 05:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
okay are there any more questions to ask
 
05:00:14.708 --> 05:00:14.718 align:start position:0%
of bonnie dunham
 
05:00:18.830 --> 05:00:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:21.350 --> 05:00:21.360 align:start position:0%
much let's see
 
05:00:25.270 --> 05:00:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:27.430 --> 05:00:27.440 align:start position:0%
okay so we are done that one right now
 
05:00:34.788 --> 05:00:34.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:37.190 --> 05:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
and we'll get ready to go into the next
 
05:00:39.590 --> 05:00:39.600 align:start position:0%
hearing here which starts in about two
 
05:00:42.948 --> 05:00:42.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:15.830 --> 05:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:15.840 --> 05:02:11.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

05:02:11.830 --> 05:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:11.840 --> 05:03:01.110 align:start position:0%
 
you

05:03:01.110 --> 05:03:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:04.708 --> 05:03:04.718 align:start position:0%
we're at hb6 uh 1670 right now relative
 
05:03:06.788 --> 05:03:06.798 align:start position:0%

05:03:17.360 --> 05:03:18.550 align:start position:0%
we have represented bonnie hamm no
yes

05:03:18.550 --> 05:03:18.560 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:03:21.190 --> 05:03:21.200 align:start position:0%
mask i can't see through the mass
 
05:03:22.868 --> 05:03:22.878 align:start position:0%
there no no you don't don't take it off
 
05:03:24.070 --> 05:03:24.080 align:start position:0%
i'm just saying
 
05:03:33.030 --> 05:03:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:35.350 --> 05:03:35.360 align:start position:0%
press the silver button
 
05:03:36.788 --> 05:03:36.798 align:start position:0%
there you go
 
05:03:39.190 --> 05:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
hi there i am representative bonnie ham
 
05:03:40.948 --> 05:03:40.958 align:start position:0%
i represent lincoln woodstock in
 
05:03:42.550 --> 05:03:42.560 align:start position:0%
waterville valley
 
05:03:46.788 --> 05:03:46.798 align:start position:0%
and i am here to introduce and support
 
05:03:49.750 --> 05:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
house bill 1670 which is a bill relative
 
05:03:51.990 --> 05:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
to funds of the education freedom
 
05:03:54.070 --> 05:03:54.080 align:start position:0%
account program after termination of a
 
05:03:55.990 --> 05:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
student's participation
 
05:03:58.788 --> 05:03:58.798 align:start position:0%
in the program and responsibilities of
 
05:04:02.830 --> 05:04:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:08.310 --> 05:04:08.320 align:start position:0%
basically if i feel and and this bill um
 
05:04:11.190 --> 05:04:11.200 align:start position:0%
states that if a student chooses to stop
 
05:04:14.230 --> 05:04:14.240 align:start position:0%
participating in an education fund
 
05:04:16.550 --> 05:04:16.560 align:start position:0%
account program for any reason there can
 
05:04:19.430 --> 05:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
be a number of reasons
 
05:04:22.070 --> 05:04:22.080 align:start position:0%
that that could happen
 
05:04:22.080 --> 05:04:23.110 align:start position:0%
that that could happen
that

05:04:23.110 --> 05:04:23.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:04:25.590 --> 05:04:25.600 align:start position:0%
subsequent payments
 
05:04:27.670 --> 05:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
and further expenditures should
 
05:04:29.910 --> 05:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
terminate upon
 
05:04:32.550 --> 05:04:32.560 align:start position:0%
that student choosing not to participate
 
05:04:34.708 --> 05:04:34.718 align:start position:0%
in the education
 
05:04:37.670 --> 05:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:39.110 --> 05:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
whether they go back to the public
 
05:04:41.030 --> 05:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
school whether there's been misuse of
 
05:04:43.430 --> 05:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
the funds or whether they've
 
05:04:46.310 --> 05:04:46.320 align:start position:0%
have another idea for their education
 
05:04:48.390 --> 05:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire should not
 
05:04:50.868 --> 05:04:50.878 align:start position:0%
continue to support
 
05:04:54.310 --> 05:04:54.320 align:start position:0%
his education fund
 
05:04:56.470 --> 05:04:56.480 align:start position:0%
account any further
 
05:04:59.750 --> 05:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
and so the money should stop the flow of
 
05:05:02.470 --> 05:05:02.480 align:start position:0%
money should stop both payments
 
05:05:05.190 --> 05:05:05.200 align:start position:0%
and expenses that we pay out
 
05:05:08.788 --> 05:05:08.798 align:start position:0%
now if the student decides to go back in
 
05:05:11.030 --> 05:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
to the program at a later date
 
05:05:11.040 --> 05:05:11.830 align:start position:0%
to the program at a later date
then

05:05:11.830 --> 05:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
then
 
05:05:14.788 --> 05:05:14.798 align:start position:0%
the student can reapply
 
05:05:17.590 --> 05:05:17.600 align:start position:0%
and funding will resume
 
05:05:17.600 --> 05:05:18.310 align:start position:0%
and funding will resume
so

05:05:18.310 --> 05:05:18.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:05:19.590 --> 05:05:19.600 align:start position:0%
to me it just
 
05:05:22.070 --> 05:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
makes sense that we shouldn't be sending
 
05:05:22.080 --> 05:05:23.190 align:start position:0%
makes sense that we shouldn't be sending
money

05:05:23.190 --> 05:05:23.200 align:start position:0%
money
 
05:05:25.430 --> 05:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
to a program that the student isn't
 
05:05:27.190 --> 05:05:27.200 align:start position:0%
participating in
 
05:05:29.510 --> 05:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
and it further requires
 
05:05:31.030 --> 05:05:31.040 align:start position:0%
an audit
 
05:05:31.040 --> 05:05:31.910 align:start position:0%
an audit
of

05:05:31.910 --> 05:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:05:34.788 --> 05:05:34.798 align:start position:0%
the individual's account
 
05:05:37.510 --> 05:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
and or random audit audits of the
 
05:05:39.510 --> 05:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
program in general
 
05:05:41.510 --> 05:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the funds are being
 
05:05:41.520 --> 05:05:42.550 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the funds are being
used

05:05:42.550 --> 05:05:42.560 align:start position:0%
used
 
05:05:42.560 --> 05:05:44.868 align:start position:0%
used
appropriately

05:05:44.868 --> 05:05:44.878 align:start position:0%
appropriately
 
05:05:47.350 --> 05:05:47.360 align:start position:0%
and i'm open to any questions or further
 
05:05:50.070 --> 05:05:50.080 align:start position:0%
explanations of
 
05:05:52.310 --> 05:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
my idea for a bill
 
05:05:53.830 --> 05:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative ham
 
05:05:54.830 --> 05:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
are there
 
05:05:54.840 --> 05:05:56.628 align:start position:0%
are there
questions

05:05:56.628 --> 05:05:56.638 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:05:58.948 --> 05:05:58.958 align:start position:0%
reps and lakers
 
05:06:00.550 --> 05:06:00.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:06:03.830 --> 05:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:07.190 --> 05:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
if in in in law already it says that the
 
05:06:09.990 --> 05:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
funds will immediately be suspended but
 
05:06:13.350 --> 05:06:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:16.470 --> 05:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
parents often first they have to
 
05:06:16.480 --> 05:06:17.430 align:start position:0%
parents often first they have to
apply

05:06:17.430 --> 05:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
apply
 
05:06:19.510 --> 05:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
they have to get permission from the
 
05:06:21.750 --> 05:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization to spend
 
05:06:21.760 --> 05:06:23.270 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization to spend
anything

05:06:23.270 --> 05:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
anything
 
05:06:25.430 --> 05:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
then they may have to
 
05:06:28.310 --> 05:06:28.320 align:start position:0%
order etc whatever it is that they're
 
05:06:30.390 --> 05:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
trying to get which sometimes can take
 
05:06:31.830 --> 05:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
some time
 
05:06:33.990 --> 05:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
and then off and then
 
05:06:36.310 --> 05:06:36.320 align:start position:0%
sometimes they actually have to pay up
 
05:06:38.550 --> 05:06:38.560 align:start position:0%
front for that item
 
05:06:42.868 --> 05:06:42.878 align:start position:0%
and then eventually once they submit the
 
05:06:46.470 --> 05:06:46.480 align:start position:0%
receipt then they get reimbursed and i'm
 
05:06:48.390 --> 05:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
wondering what happens to the parent
 
05:06:50.708 --> 05:06:50.718 align:start position:0%
who's caught in the middle of that
 
05:06:52.948 --> 05:06:52.958 align:start position:0%
if they've gotten the okay
 
05:06:55.270 --> 05:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
put in the order potentially paid out of
 
05:06:55.280 --> 05:06:56.868 align:start position:0%
put in the order potentially paid out of
pocket

05:06:56.868 --> 05:06:56.878 align:start position:0%
pocket
 
05:06:58.788 --> 05:06:58.798 align:start position:0%
counting on that money coming in from
 
05:07:02.628 --> 05:07:02.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:04.708 --> 05:07:04.718 align:start position:0%
and they've been in the program like it
 
05:07:06.708 --> 05:07:06.718 align:start position:0%
says here at least a year so it's an
 
05:07:08.230 --> 05:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
ongoing thing
 
05:07:11.110 --> 05:07:11.120 align:start position:0%
and then decide for whatever reason that
 
05:07:12.390 --> 05:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
actually they're going to put the kid
 
05:07:14.788 --> 05:07:14.798 align:start position:0%
back in public school are they can they
 
05:07:16.788 --> 05:07:16.798 align:start position:0%
still be reimbursed for that okayed
 
05:07:19.270 --> 05:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
expense that they incurred while the
 
05:07:20.788 --> 05:07:20.798 align:start position:0%
student was
 
05:07:23.030 --> 05:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
an afa student or
 
05:07:25.830 --> 05:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
are they now on the hook for that
 
05:07:28.390 --> 05:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
in my opinion and i don't know if this
 
05:07:29.990 --> 05:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
bill states it
 
05:07:32.390 --> 05:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
adequately certainly
 
05:07:34.788 --> 05:07:34.798 align:start position:0%
anything that was ordered
 
05:07:37.910 --> 05:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
as part of the educational opportunity
 
05:07:40.470 --> 05:07:40.480 align:start position:0%
the child was participating in
 
05:07:42.628 --> 05:07:42.638 align:start position:0%
should be reimbursed and i do agree
 
05:07:44.788 --> 05:07:44.798 align:start position:0%
there can be a delay
 
05:07:44.798 --> 05:07:45.590 align:start position:0%
there can be a delay
in

05:07:45.590 --> 05:07:45.600 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:07:49.350 --> 05:07:49.360 align:start position:0%
getting bills paid and so forth but um
 
05:07:50.708 --> 05:07:50.718 align:start position:0%
i would think
 
05:07:52.628 --> 05:07:52.638 align:start position:0%
that and i would welcome any language
 
05:07:54.230 --> 05:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
that made it clear
 
05:07:57.990 --> 05:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
if any expenditure that had to do with
 
05:08:00.550 --> 05:08:00.560 align:start position:0%
his his educational opportunity while he
 
05:08:04.070 --> 05:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:06.470 --> 05:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
should be reimbursed
 
05:08:06.480 --> 05:08:07.430 align:start position:0%
should be reimbursed
but

05:08:07.430 --> 05:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:08:07.440 --> 05:08:09.510 align:start position:0%
but
certainly

05:08:09.510 --> 05:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
05:08:12.708 --> 05:08:12.718 align:start position:0%
the year if the child is in the program
 
05:08:14.550 --> 05:08:14.560 align:start position:0%
six months and
 
05:08:16.070 --> 05:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
you know we shouldn't be paying for
 
05:08:17.750 --> 05:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
bills for the
 
05:08:17.760 --> 05:08:18.628 align:start position:0%
bills for the
uh

05:08:18.628 --> 05:08:18.638 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:08:22.150 --> 05:08:22.160 align:start position:0%
second sixth month the year the year um
 
05:08:23.990 --> 05:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
one of the key things in here is that
 
05:08:24.000 --> 05:08:24.948 align:start position:0%
one of the key things in here is that
year

05:08:24.948 --> 05:08:24.958 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:08:27.910 --> 05:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
that year if we could somehow word it so
 
05:08:29.270 --> 05:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
that we are
 
05:08:32.070 --> 05:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
legitimately reimbursing for
 
05:08:34.788 --> 05:08:34.798 align:start position:0%
expenses for the opportunity he
 
05:08:37.110 --> 05:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
participated in and received
 
05:08:38.390 --> 05:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
and didn't
 
05:08:39.670 --> 05:08:39.680 align:start position:0%
pay for
 
05:08:41.830 --> 05:08:41.840 align:start position:0%
other items
 
05:08:44.150 --> 05:08:44.160 align:start position:0%
that had nothing to do with the
 
05:08:46.150 --> 05:08:46.160 align:start position:0%
educational weapon opportunity he
 
05:08:46.160 --> 05:08:47.190 align:start position:0%
educational weapon opportunity he
enjoyed

05:08:47.190 --> 05:08:47.200 align:start position:0%
enjoyed
 
05:08:49.750 --> 05:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
i would welcome any amendment that
 
05:08:53.430 --> 05:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:55.110 --> 05:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
whoops thank you very much
 
05:08:56.150 --> 05:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:08:59.110 --> 05:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
further further questions
 
05:09:00.868 --> 05:09:00.878 align:start position:0%
so thank you thank you very much mr
 
05:09:02.390 --> 05:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
chair and um
 
05:09:05.830 --> 05:09:05.840 align:start position:0%
and uh and thank you very much um um uh
 
05:09:09.750 --> 05:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
representative ham for for bringing 1670
 
05:09:11.430 --> 05:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
forward this afternoon
 
05:09:14.150 --> 05:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
one of the things that um that that this
 
05:09:16.948 --> 05:09:16.958 align:start position:0%
committee has wrestled with a little bit
 
05:09:18.230 --> 05:09:18.240 align:start position:0%
is the um
 
05:09:22.390 --> 05:09:22.400 align:start position:0%
is the the the language in here that um
 
05:09:26.470 --> 05:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
where um where uh misuse of funds misuse
 
05:09:29.190 --> 05:09:29.200 align:start position:0%
of funds must be intentional and
 
05:09:29.200 --> 05:09:30.628 align:start position:0%
of funds must be intentional and
substantial

05:09:30.628 --> 05:09:30.638 align:start position:0%
substantial
 
05:09:30.638 --> 05:09:31.510 align:start position:0%
substantial
and

05:09:31.510 --> 05:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:09:33.110 --> 05:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
uh and i was wondering if you could talk
 
05:09:35.510 --> 05:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
with us a little bit about um
 
05:09:36.948 --> 05:09:36.958 align:start position:0%
about maybe
 
05:09:39.350 --> 05:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
you know why intentional is something
 
05:09:41.750 --> 05:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
the attorney general would investigate
 
05:09:43.990 --> 05:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
and substantial would be something the
 
05:09:46.948 --> 05:09:46.958 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization would determine
 
05:09:48.708 --> 05:09:48.718 align:start position:0%
if you know
 
05:09:51.830 --> 05:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
the words intentional
 
05:09:53.270 --> 05:09:53.280 align:start position:0%
have been
 
05:09:53.280 --> 05:09:56.628 align:start position:0%
have been
deleted

05:09:56.628 --> 05:09:56.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:00.230 --> 05:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
they have that change has been suggested
 
05:10:03.510 --> 05:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
and i think it's because pretty hard
 
05:10:03.520 --> 05:10:04.788 align:start position:0%
and i think it's because pretty hard
to

05:10:04.788 --> 05:10:04.798 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:10:06.390 --> 05:10:06.400 align:start position:0%
prove intent
 
05:10:07.750 --> 05:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:10:09.670 --> 05:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
we really don't want to go there we just
 
05:10:11.430 --> 05:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
don't want to pay for
 
05:10:13.590 --> 05:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
uh expenses that weren't part of the
 
05:10:15.750 --> 05:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
education received
 
05:10:18.550 --> 05:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
so that the word intentional was deleted
 
05:10:23.110 --> 05:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:24.948 --> 05:10:24.958 align:start position:0%
was retained
 
05:10:24.958 --> 05:10:25.700 align:start position:0%
was retained
and

05:10:25.700 --> 05:10:25.710 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:10:25.710 --> 05:10:27.510 align:start position:0%
and
[Music]

05:10:27.510 --> 05:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:10:30.390 --> 05:10:30.400 align:start position:0%
you notice substantial is a word used in
 
05:10:31.910 --> 05:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
several places substantial
 
05:10:31.920 --> 05:10:35.190 align:start position:0%
several places substantial
misrepresentation

05:10:35.190 --> 05:10:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:37.990 --> 05:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
substantial misuse
 
05:10:41.270 --> 05:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
um and and i would say uh when they
 
05:10:42.868 --> 05:10:42.878 align:start position:0%
drafted this
 
05:10:42.878 --> 05:10:43.830 align:start position:0%
drafted this
um

05:10:43.830 --> 05:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:10:43.840 --> 05:10:44.708 align:start position:0%
um
that

05:10:44.708 --> 05:10:44.718 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:10:47.670 --> 05:10:47.680 align:start position:0%
that's kind of indicating to me
 
05:10:50.550 --> 05:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
that well perhaps it isn't worthwhile to
 
05:10:52.390 --> 05:10:52.400 align:start position:0%
chase down
 
05:10:54.390 --> 05:10:54.400 align:start position:0%
fifty dollars you know i don't know what
 
05:10:57.350 --> 05:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
dollar amount you'd wanna use but
 
05:10:59.590 --> 05:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
i think that's to indicate
 
05:11:01.830 --> 05:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
substantial you know the definition of
 
05:11:01.840 --> 05:11:03.270 align:start position:0%
substantial you know the definition of
substantial

05:11:03.270 --> 05:11:03.280 align:start position:0%
substantial
 
05:11:05.350 --> 05:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
something that's worthwhile
 
05:11:07.590 --> 05:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
something that's a number big enough
 
05:11:10.070 --> 05:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
that's worth um
 
05:11:12.070 --> 05:11:12.080 align:start position:0%
going after or trying to recapture or
 
05:11:13.510 --> 05:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
whatever not
 
05:11:16.310 --> 05:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
not a dollar not fifty dollars
 
05:11:18.230 --> 05:11:18.240 align:start position:0%
and there again maybe there might be
 
05:11:20.310 --> 05:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
need to be some clarification
 
05:11:22.868 --> 05:11:22.878 align:start position:0%
or a definition of substantial but this
 
05:11:24.150 --> 05:11:24.160 align:start position:0%
isn't to
 
05:11:27.190 --> 05:11:27.200 align:start position:0%
to to take parents and students
 
05:11:29.590 --> 05:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
to court or go after them or
 
05:11:32.788 --> 05:11:32.798 align:start position:0%
or turn this into a bad experience
 
05:11:34.868 --> 05:11:34.878 align:start position:0%
this is just to
 
05:11:38.070 --> 05:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
recapture some state funds
 
05:11:38.080 --> 05:11:40.310 align:start position:0%
recapture some state funds
that

05:11:40.310 --> 05:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:11:42.310 --> 05:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
might be outlaid
 
05:11:44.628 --> 05:11:44.638 align:start position:0%
with no value
 
05:11:48.628 --> 05:11:48.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:50.788 --> 05:11:50.798 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:11:52.868 --> 05:11:52.878 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock
 
05:11:54.628 --> 05:11:54.638 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman live
 
05:11:56.150 --> 05:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
good afternoon uh thank you thank you
 
05:11:57.750 --> 05:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my question just let me show
 
05:11:59.670 --> 05:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
i understand the particular part dealing
 
05:12:02.550 --> 05:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
with lines 19 and 20.
 
05:12:04.550 --> 05:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
i'm talking about the change from may to
 
05:12:04.560 --> 05:12:05.510 align:start position:0%
i'm talking about the change from may to
shell

05:12:05.510 --> 05:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
shell
 
05:12:08.470 --> 05:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
so if i understand this bill correctly
 
05:12:11.430 --> 05:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
every student that does withdraw
 
05:12:14.230 --> 05:12:14.240 align:start position:0%
from the efa during the time of the
 
05:12:17.270 --> 05:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
their account the account is frozen
 
05:12:19.030 --> 05:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
except for the types of bills you talk
 
05:12:21.990 --> 05:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
with president weakest but their their
 
05:12:24.948 --> 05:12:24.958 align:start position:0%
account will be all audited yes okay
 
05:12:26.150 --> 05:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
that's what it means okay thank you so
 
05:12:27.990 --> 05:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
much thank you representative you're
 
05:12:31.030 --> 05:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
welcome any further questions
 
05:12:33.190 --> 05:12:33.200 align:start position:0%
bonnie i i have one question for you on
 
05:12:35.270 --> 05:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
the other page it's kind of a
 
05:12:37.510 --> 05:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
just a technical type thing on line 14
 
05:12:38.948 --> 05:12:38.958 align:start position:0%
on page two
 
05:12:40.868 --> 05:12:40.878 align:start position:0%
you talk about notifying the parent
 
05:12:43.270 --> 05:12:43.280 align:start position:0%
within five business days
 
05:12:45.030 --> 05:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
it takes about five days believe it or
 
05:12:46.470 --> 05:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
not for a letter to get from haverhill
 
05:12:47.990 --> 05:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
to concord
 
05:12:48.000 --> 05:12:49.670 align:start position:0%
to concord
um

05:12:49.670 --> 05:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:51.990 --> 05:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
it's all downhill that's right
 
05:12:54.470 --> 05:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
um so is that just a number that
 
05:12:56.470 --> 05:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
somebody selected or could it be
 
05:12:58.390 --> 05:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
extended like to 10 days
 
05:13:00.550 --> 05:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
sure that was just a number as opposed
 
05:13:03.030 --> 05:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
to as quickly as possible which could
 
05:13:04.550 --> 05:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
mean anything
 
05:13:06.788 --> 05:13:06.798 align:start position:0%
could be months could be whatever i
 
05:13:09.030 --> 05:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
think uh we tried to
 
05:13:12.070 --> 05:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
put a number to it meaning quickly
 
05:13:14.948 --> 05:13:14.958 align:start position:0%
quickly not two months later so i mean
 
05:13:18.150 --> 05:13:18.160 align:start position:0%
certainly five days um
 
05:13:20.628 --> 05:13:20.638 align:start position:0%
is is a tough uh bar
 
05:13:24.070 --> 05:13:24.080 align:start position:0%
to maintain or even ten maybe ten or two
 
05:13:27.030 --> 05:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
weeks or something or something prompt a
 
05:13:29.350 --> 05:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
notice not not let this hanging for
 
05:13:31.590 --> 05:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
months okay thank you uh further

you know that's
 
05:13:49.030 --> 05:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
that that is grafton county

bill we've been just discussing
 
05:14:15.110 --> 05:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
luno has one question quick compliance
 
05:14:15.120 --> 05:14:16.070 align:start position:0%
luno has one question quick compliance
question

05:14:16.070 --> 05:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:14:17.190 --> 05:14:17.200 align:start position:0%
very quick
 
05:14:19.990 --> 05:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
and it actually relates to
 
05:14:22.550 --> 05:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
representative lucas's
 
05:14:24.390 --> 05:14:24.400 align:start position:0%
question on
 
05:14:26.470 --> 05:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
on page one
 
05:14:28.708 --> 05:14:28.718 align:start position:0%
beginning at line
 
05:14:31.270 --> 05:14:31.280 align:start position:0%
five where where
 
05:14:33.270 --> 05:14:33.280 align:start position:0%
we're enrolling as a full-time student
 
05:14:35.190 --> 05:14:35.200 align:start position:0%
in the resident district
 
05:14:35.200 --> 05:14:36.868 align:start position:0%
in the resident district
um

05:14:36.868 --> 05:14:36.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:38.550 --> 05:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
shall result in
 
05:14:40.150 --> 05:14:40.160 align:start position:0%
the first part is immediate suspension
 
05:14:41.990 --> 05:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
of payment of additional funds into the
 
05:14:43.990 --> 05:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
student cfa
 
05:14:46.070 --> 05:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
or mac oh he's filling out a card all
 
05:14:46.080 --> 05:14:48.550 align:start position:0%
or mac oh he's filling out a card all
right

05:14:48.550 --> 05:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:14:50.708 --> 05:14:50.718 align:start position:0%
here i am reading it is even like uh and
 
05:14:52.070 --> 05:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
he left
 
05:14:53.990 --> 05:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
he's out of the building
 
05:14:55.590 --> 05:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
okay i'm sorry no no that's all right
 
05:14:58.390 --> 05:14:58.400 align:start position:0%
that's all right so um looking at um
 
05:15:00.230 --> 05:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
looking at page one starting at line
 
05:15:00.240 --> 05:15:01.110 align:start position:0%
looking at page one starting at line
five

05:15:01.110 --> 05:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
five
 
05:15:03.910 --> 05:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
where a student has has enrolled back in
 
05:15:05.670 --> 05:15:05.680 align:start position:0%
their um in their
 
05:15:09.190 --> 05:15:09.200 align:start position:0%
uh home uh resident um public school
 
05:15:10.550 --> 05:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:15:12.310 --> 05:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
and current law says that that results
 
05:15:14.150 --> 05:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
in the immediate suspension of payment
 
05:15:15.670 --> 05:15:15.680 align:start position:0%
of additional funds
 
05:15:18.150 --> 05:15:18.160 align:start position:0%
into the fa so that's state dollars
 
05:15:19.990 --> 05:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
going into the efa
 
05:15:22.550 --> 05:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
not not necessarily
 
05:15:24.628 --> 05:15:24.638 align:start position:0%
withdrawals that you're making from the
 
05:15:24.638 --> 05:15:25.910 align:start position:0%
withdrawals that you're making from the
efa

05:15:25.910 --> 05:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
efa
 
05:15:28.150 --> 05:15:28.160 align:start position:0%
under current law that would be correct
 
05:15:31.670 --> 05:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
to to to pay um uh
 
05:15:33.350 --> 05:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
provider costs or
 
05:15:36.150 --> 05:15:36.160 align:start position:0%
or something like that correct but um
 
05:15:39.030 --> 05:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
but but i think um replicas brings up a
 
05:15:40.390 --> 05:15:40.400 align:start position:0%
good point
 
05:15:42.708 --> 05:15:42.718 align:start position:0%
uh what if um
 
05:15:45.910 --> 05:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
what if uh um based on the the language
 
05:15:48.470 --> 05:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
on lines 11 and 12
 
05:15:51.350 --> 05:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
were to were to kick in
 
05:15:51.360 --> 05:15:52.150 align:start position:0%
were to were to kick in
um

05:15:52.150 --> 05:15:52.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:54.310 --> 05:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
uh does um
 
05:15:57.110 --> 05:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
does the scholarship organization
 
05:15:59.910 --> 05:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
have any and and i think it might
 
05:16:02.390 --> 05:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
even including this the lang the
 
05:16:04.550 --> 05:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
proposed language have an ability to
 
05:16:04.560 --> 05:16:05.910 align:start position:0%
proposed language have an ability to
encumber

05:16:05.910 --> 05:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
encumber
 
05:16:07.750 --> 05:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
um funds
 
05:16:10.550 --> 05:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
once you get a request for reimbursement
 
05:16:12.708 --> 05:16:12.718 align:start position:0%
even if that reimbursement hasn't been
 
05:16:15.750 --> 05:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
made are you able to encumber funds
 
05:16:16.948 --> 05:16:16.958 align:start position:0%
so that
 
05:16:18.788 --> 05:16:18.798 align:start position:0%
you know if something intervening
 
05:16:21.030 --> 05:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
happens like the student decides to go
 
05:16:22.708 --> 05:16:22.718 align:start position:0%
to a public school
 
05:16:24.948 --> 05:16:24.958 align:start position:0%
but you still owe the first semester
 
05:16:26.868 --> 05:16:26.878 align:start position:0%
tuition bill for wherever they were
 
05:16:29.270 --> 05:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
attending before i'm just making it up
 
05:16:31.750 --> 05:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
um that you'd still be able to pay that
 
05:16:33.830 --> 05:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
uh i think i mean this is a this is sort
 
05:16:36.550 --> 05:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
of a technical issue in the weeds it's
 
05:16:38.550 --> 05:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
an accounting in the weeds right i think
 
05:16:41.750 --> 05:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
yeah so uh i think what we would do is
 
05:16:44.230 --> 05:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
if if a student left the efa program to
 
05:16:45.750 --> 05:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
return to their in-district public
 
05:16:48.150 --> 05:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
school obviously the account would not
 
05:16:49.830 --> 05:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
receive any more
 
05:16:52.868 --> 05:16:52.878 align:start position:0%
public public funds because
 
05:16:55.110 --> 05:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
as you said in statute they're that's
 
05:16:57.350 --> 05:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
not allowable um so we would turn off
 
05:16:59.510 --> 05:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
their ability to to get any more funds i
 
05:17:02.550 --> 05:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
think that we could put a process in
 
05:17:02.560 --> 05:17:04.070 align:start position:0%
think that we could put a process in
place

05:17:04.070 --> 05:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
place
 
05:17:07.110 --> 05:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
where that account could be flagged
 
05:17:10.230 --> 05:17:10.240 align:start position:0%
somehow um and then we we you know we
 
05:17:12.470 --> 05:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
could we could work something out right
 
05:17:13.830 --> 05:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
i think so
 
05:17:16.470 --> 05:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
such as encumbering funds like what
 
05:17:18.868 --> 05:17:18.878 align:start position:0%
well it's it's it's hard to know because
 
05:17:21.350 --> 05:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't we wouldn't know okay right
 
05:17:24.550 --> 05:17:24.560 align:start position:0%
what what what the cost would be um what
 
05:17:26.948 --> 05:17:26.958 align:start position:0%
they would be spending those
 
05:17:28.788 --> 05:17:28.798 align:start position:0%
funds on well i guess
 
05:17:29.590 --> 05:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:17:31.830 --> 05:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
fault follow-up though but yes but but
 
05:17:34.230 --> 05:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
those requests have already been put in
 
05:17:36.788 --> 05:17:36.798 align:start position:0%
because they were subject to approval
 
05:17:39.190 --> 05:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
by the scholarship organization upfront
 
05:17:41.590 --> 05:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
certainly if they made the request prior
 
05:17:43.590 --> 05:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
to exiting that's true absolutely right
 
05:17:45.030 --> 05:17:45.040 align:start position:0%
that's all i'm saying made the request
 
05:17:46.470 --> 05:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
prior to exiting and i think that would
 
05:17:48.310 --> 05:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
then yeah that would be they would be
 
05:17:50.310 --> 05:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
queued up in the system all right great
 
05:17:52.788 --> 05:17:52.798 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:17:54.948 --> 05:17:54.958 align:start position:0%
any further questions uh representative
 
05:17:54.958 --> 05:17:56.230 align:start position:0%
any further questions uh representative
baum

05:17:56.230 --> 05:17:56.240 align:start position:0%
baum
 
05:17:58.070 --> 05:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you matt
 
05:18:00.550 --> 05:18:00.560 align:start position:0%
taking a question for example
 
05:18:03.190 --> 05:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
following up on representative luna
 
05:18:03.200 --> 05:18:03.910 align:start position:0%
following up on representative luna
a

05:18:03.910 --> 05:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:18:03.920 --> 05:18:04.948 align:start position:0%
a
tuition

05:18:04.948 --> 05:18:04.958 align:start position:0%
tuition
 
05:18:06.948 --> 05:18:06.958 align:start position:0%
payment has already been made to a
 
05:18:06.958 --> 05:18:07.910 align:start position:0%
payment has already been made to a
school

05:18:07.910 --> 05:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
school
 
05:18:09.990 --> 05:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
and it drops out halfway through
 
05:18:11.990 --> 05:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
representative can you look for the
 
05:18:15.990 --> 05:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:17.670 --> 05:18:17.680 align:start position:0%
if a tuition payment has already been
 
05:18:19.430 --> 05:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
made to the school
 
05:18:21.750 --> 05:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
okay and the student drops out and goes
 
05:18:23.030 --> 05:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
back to the public school halfway
 
05:18:24.948 --> 05:18:24.958 align:start position:0%
through they're probably not going to be
 
05:18:27.190 --> 05:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
any way of getting half of that tuition
 
05:18:28.788 --> 05:18:28.798 align:start position:0%
payment correct
 
05:18:31.190 --> 05:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
no there's probably not any way and any
 
05:18:33.270 --> 05:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
refunds would come back to their efa
 
05:18:35.510 --> 05:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
account not obviously not to the parents
 
05:18:40.628 --> 05:18:40.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:43.270 --> 05:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
yes representative porter thank you so
 
05:18:44.830 --> 05:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
if someone was
 
05:18:48.628 --> 05:18:48.638 align:start position:0%
um decided that they needed a
 
05:18:51.190 --> 05:18:51.200 align:start position:0%
new computer as part of their
 
05:18:53.350 --> 05:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
program homeschooled or whatever and
 
05:18:55.110 --> 05:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
they put the uh
 
05:18:57.190 --> 05:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
request in
 
05:18:58.868 --> 05:18:58.878 align:start position:0%
those funds would be encumbered or
 
05:19:00.948 --> 05:19:00.958 align:start position:0%
whatever they'd you'd say okay yeah you
 
05:19:03.270 --> 05:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
can go get the computer and then a few
 
05:19:06.788 --> 05:19:06.798 align:start position:0%
months later they drop out that
 
05:19:06.798 --> 05:19:09.110 align:start position:0%
months later they drop out that
still

05:19:09.110 --> 05:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
still
 
05:19:11.190 --> 05:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
that would be paid for because it was
 
05:19:13.270 --> 05:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
put in prior to
 
05:19:13.280 --> 05:19:14.310 align:start position:0%
put in prior to
there

05:19:14.310 --> 05:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:19:17.270 --> 05:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
well assuming that they had the funds
 
05:19:18.868 --> 05:19:18.878 align:start position:0%
and assuming that they had not purchased
 
05:19:20.550 --> 05:19:20.560 align:start position:0%
a computer because administrative rules
 
05:19:22.470 --> 05:19:22.480 align:start position:0%
you can only purchase one computer every
 
05:19:23.510 --> 05:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
three years
 
05:19:25.590 --> 05:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
uh then that would be considered an
 
05:19:28.070 --> 05:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
allowable expense
 
05:19:30.070 --> 05:19:30.080 align:start position:0%

no
 
05:38:03.510 --> 05:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
i i asked that question here i was
 
05:38:05.190 --> 05:38:05.200 align:start position:0%
saying can we take you know do something
 
05:38:07.190 --> 05:38:07.200 align:start position:0%

i i thought you know it'd be great to do
 
05:38:18.628 --> 05:38:18.638 align:start position:0%
it but you know we can't
 
05:38:20.628 --> 05:38:20.638 align:start position:0%

stop on the way but
no

05:38:21.430 --> 05:38:21.440 align:start position:0%
no
 
05:38:23.590 --> 05:38:23.600 align:start position:0%
so we're not going to be meeting on that
 
05:38:29.190 --> 05:38:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:31.350 --> 05:38:31.360 align:start position:0%

05:38:33.030 --> 05:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
or something gets put in what the 18th
 
05:38:34.628 --> 05:38:34.638 align:start position:0%

05:38:36.708 --> 05:38:36.718 align:start position:0%
yeah uh i haven't looked at that week
 
05:38:38.310 --> 05:38:38.320 align:start position:0%
i'm not looking at all those bills we
 
05:38:40.150 --> 05:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
have yet to do and we have a lot of
 
05:38:41.430 --> 05:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
stuff and we're going to have a lot of
 
05:38:43.830 --> 05:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
bills coming up with a lot of debate
 
05:38:46.310 --> 05:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
uh so we're going to have to start
 
05:38:49.030 --> 05:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
scheduling that in i have set up so on
 
05:38:52.628 --> 05:38:52.638 align:start position:0%
the 9th there will be
 
05:38:54.548 --> 05:38:54.558 align:start position:0%
on the 9th we're going to have to exact
 
05:38:56.868 --> 05:38:56.878 align:start position:0%
those 7 early bills which we have
 
05:38:59.430 --> 05:38:59.440 align:start position:0%
remaining we had
 
05:39:02.070 --> 05:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
what 16 early bills i think we thought
 
05:39:03.990 --> 05:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
it was 15 we had one added on which i
 
05:39:07.350 --> 05:39:07.360 align:start position:0%
wasn't aware of so we have 16 we we have
 
05:39:09.990 --> 05:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
done nine of them so far we have seven
 
05:39:11.030 --> 05:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
to go
 
05:39:12.230 --> 05:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
and then
 
05:39:14.150 --> 05:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
after we're done on the ninth those
 
05:39:15.990 --> 05:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
early bills we'll start whittling down
 
05:39:17.350 --> 05:39:17.360 align:start position:0%
that list
 
05:39:19.750 --> 05:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
of the bills which i've
 
05:39:21.030 --> 05:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
selected here
 
05:39:23.110 --> 05:39:23.120 align:start position:0%
and i've given a copy to representative
 
05:39:25.510 --> 05:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
cordelli and to representative luna
 
05:39:27.110 --> 05:39:27.120 align:start position:0%
we're going to work down into that list
 
05:39:30.070 --> 05:39:30.080 align:start position:0%
of bills to start executing
 
05:39:40.150 --> 05:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:44.830 --> 05:39:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:48.150 --> 05:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
yes i haven't planned on that at this
 
05:39:49.430 --> 05:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
point in time
 
05:39:49.440 --> 05:39:51.990 align:start position:0%
point in time
um

05:39:51.990 --> 05:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:12.948 --> 05:40:12.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:14.470 --> 05:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
i haven't you know i have to look at
 
05:40:16.948 --> 05:40:16.958 align:start position:0%
that schedule here um
 
05:40:19.030 --> 05:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
i have not i had not been planning to
 
05:40:20.788 --> 05:40:20.798 align:start position:0%
exact we can exec anytime we wanted
 
05:40:23.030 --> 05:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
exactly if we finished some
 
05:40:28.150 --> 05:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:30.628 --> 05:40:30.638 align:start position:0%
let's we have a hearing right now
 
05:40:32.310 --> 05:40:32.320 align:start position:0%
after this hearing we'll get into some
 
05:40:34.470 --> 05:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
of this discussion okay but we have
 
05:40:36.070 --> 05:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
people here waiting i don't want to keep
 
05:40:37.510 --> 05:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
them waiting as well we're also

05:40:45.190 --> 05:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
so in looking at the calendar right now
 
05:40:47.350 --> 05:40:47.360 align:start position:0%
we have one bill left today that's hb
 
05:40:47.360 --> 05:40:50.150 align:start position:0%
we have one bill left today that's hb

05:40:52.230 --> 05:40:52.240 align:start position:0%
that is uh requiring the department of

and i'm here to introduce and sponsor
 
05:41:27.830 --> 05:41:27.840 align:start position:0%

uh

05:41:42.628 --> 05:41:42.638 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:41:47.430 --> 05:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
department has been um inserted instead
 
05:41:47.440 --> 05:41:49.030 align:start position:0%
department has been um inserted instead
um

05:41:49.030 --> 05:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:41:52.868 --> 05:41:52.878 align:start position:0%
and i feel strongly that
 
05:41:56.948 --> 05:41:56.958 align:start position:0%
this a new program this is a new idea
 
05:41:56.958 --> 05:41:58.150 align:start position:0%
this a new program this is a new idea
and

05:41:58.150 --> 05:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:42:00.788 --> 05:42:00.798 align:start position:0%
going to become part of our overall
 
05:42:00.798 --> 05:42:02.230 align:start position:0%
going to become part of our overall
educational

05:42:02.230 --> 05:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
educational
 
05:42:04.788 --> 05:42:04.798 align:start position:0%
opportunities that we offer students in
 
05:42:06.708 --> 05:42:06.718 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
05:42:08.628 --> 05:42:08.638 align:start position:0%
i feel strongly
 
05:42:11.910 --> 05:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
that this needs to be administered by
 
05:42:14.150 --> 05:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
the department of education
 
05:42:16.230 --> 05:42:16.240 align:start position:0%
just as the department of education
 
05:42:16.240 --> 05:42:17.590 align:start position:0%
just as the department of education
oversees

05:42:17.590 --> 05:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
oversees
 
05:42:21.590 --> 05:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
public schools and other opportunities
 
05:42:23.190 --> 05:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
i do not
 
05:42:24.948 --> 05:42:24.958 align:start position:0%
support it
 
05:42:24.958 --> 05:42:26.390 align:start position:0%
support it
being

05:42:26.390 --> 05:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
being
 
05:42:29.030 --> 05:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
looked at separately over here
 
05:42:31.510 --> 05:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
by a separate uh entity
 
05:42:35.910 --> 05:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
that perhaps doesn't have the same focus
 
05:42:37.190 --> 05:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
that what
 
05:42:38.868 --> 05:42:38.878 align:start position:0%
i think this
 
05:42:41.910 --> 05:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
idea this new idea needs
 
05:42:44.150 --> 05:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
it needs to be looked at in conjunction
 
05:42:46.390 --> 05:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
with the public school opportunities
 
05:42:49.030 --> 05:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
we're now offering it's an alternative
 
05:42:50.390 --> 05:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
it's another
 
05:42:52.470 --> 05:42:52.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity for students
 
05:42:54.788 --> 05:42:54.798 align:start position:0%
and i think it deserves
 
05:42:57.830 --> 05:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
the department of education's oversight
 
05:43:00.548 --> 05:43:00.558 align:start position:0%
along with that comes rulemaking along
 
05:43:02.948 --> 05:43:02.958 align:start position:0%
with that comes
 
05:43:05.270 --> 05:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
our involvement the legislative
 
05:43:05.280 --> 05:43:06.548 align:start position:0%
our involvement the legislative
involvement

05:43:06.548 --> 05:43:06.558 align:start position:0%
involvement
 
05:43:09.590 --> 05:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
it becomes more accountability
 
05:43:12.548 --> 05:43:12.558 align:start position:0%
it's public money
 
05:43:15.670 --> 05:43:15.680 align:start position:0%
it affects state and local
 
05:43:19.030 --> 05:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
it it can potentially have an impact
 
05:43:22.310 --> 05:43:22.320 align:start position:0%
on local schools
 
05:43:25.990 --> 05:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
um and so i think we need to bring it in
 
05:43:26.000 --> 05:43:27.510 align:start position:0%
um and so i think we need to bring it in
house

05:43:27.510 --> 05:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
house
 
05:43:30.788 --> 05:43:30.798 align:start position:0%
i do not think that that this is an idea
 
05:43:32.788 --> 05:43:32.798 align:start position:0%
that we should outsource
 
05:43:34.868 --> 05:43:34.878 align:start position:0%
to someone else
 
05:43:36.708 --> 05:43:36.718 align:start position:0%
to be responsible
 
05:43:40.070 --> 05:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
to make all these decisions
 
05:43:42.070 --> 05:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
i think the program
 
05:43:42.080 --> 05:43:42.948 align:start position:0%
i think the program
uh

05:43:42.948 --> 05:43:42.958 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:43:44.788 --> 05:43:44.798 align:start position:0%
could be administered
 
05:43:47.270 --> 05:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
along the same lines as
 
05:43:47.280 --> 05:43:48.548 align:start position:0%
along the same lines as
envisioned

05:43:48.548 --> 05:43:48.558 align:start position:0%
envisioned
 
05:43:51.030 --> 05:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
that there's applications for it
 
05:43:54.548 --> 05:43:54.558 align:start position:0%
and there's qualifications needed
 
05:43:57.430 --> 05:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
and so forth but
 
05:43:58.470 --> 05:43:58.480 align:start position:0%
i just
 
05:44:00.628 --> 05:44:00.638 align:start position:0%
don't see
 
05:44:00.638 --> 05:44:01.830 align:start position:0%
don't see
it

05:44:01.830 --> 05:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:44:03.750 --> 05:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
becoming part
 
05:44:06.390 --> 05:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
of our master plan
 
05:44:07.990 --> 05:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
as readily
 
05:44:10.070 --> 05:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
or as appropriately
 
05:44:13.910 --> 05:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps as it needs to become part of
 
05:44:16.868 --> 05:44:16.878 align:start position:0%
our overall education plan for our
 
05:44:16.878 --> 05:44:18.070 align:start position:0%
our overall education plan for our
students

05:44:18.070 --> 05:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
students
 
05:44:19.670 --> 05:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
for our communities
 
05:44:21.670 --> 05:44:21.680 align:start position:0%
for our
 
05:44:23.750 --> 05:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
05:44:23.760 --> 05:44:25.430 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
and

05:44:25.430 --> 05:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:44:25.440 --> 05:44:27.030 align:start position:0%
and
um

05:44:27.030 --> 05:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:44:29.030 --> 05:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
in my mind
 
05:44:31.990 --> 05:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
the same monies that perhaps
 
05:44:34.070 --> 05:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
we are paying um
 
05:44:36.628 --> 05:44:36.638 align:start position:0%
to have someone else administer this
 
05:44:36.638 --> 05:44:37.750 align:start position:0%
to have someone else administer this
program

05:44:37.750 --> 05:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
program
 
05:44:38.788 --> 05:44:38.798 align:start position:0%
can be
 
05:44:41.190 --> 05:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
monies used to offset
 
05:44:41.200 --> 05:44:42.310 align:start position:0%
monies used to offset
the

05:44:42.310 --> 05:44:42.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:44:44.150 --> 05:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
additions we need
 
05:44:44.160 --> 05:44:44.948 align:start position:0%
additions we need
to

05:44:44.948 --> 05:44:44.958 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:44:46.868 --> 05:44:46.878 align:start position:0%
provide to the department of education
 
05:44:48.948 --> 05:44:48.958 align:start position:0%
to perhaps oversee this
 
05:44:51.750 --> 05:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
but i see so many advantages
 
05:44:51.760 --> 05:44:53.270 align:start position:0%
but i see so many advantages
to

05:44:53.270 --> 05:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:44:55.670 --> 05:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
it becoming part
 
05:44:55.680 --> 05:44:56.708 align:start position:0%
it becoming part
of

05:44:56.708 --> 05:44:56.718 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:44:59.510 --> 05:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire's
 
05:45:02.150 --> 05:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
education plan i think it i think it's
 
05:45:03.990 --> 05:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
an idea that may
 
05:45:06.628 --> 05:45:06.638 align:start position:0%
take off even better than
 
05:45:09.990 --> 05:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
than we envisioned i think there may be
 
05:45:12.628 --> 05:45:12.638 align:start position:0%
a good deal of interest in this
 
05:45:12.638 --> 05:45:14.150 align:start position:0%
a good deal of interest in this
additional

05:45:14.150 --> 05:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
additional
 
05:45:14.160 --> 05:45:15.750 align:start position:0%
additional
opportunity

05:45:15.750 --> 05:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
05:45:18.150 --> 05:45:18.160 align:start position:0%
to custom tailor
 
05:45:22.708 --> 05:45:22.718 align:start position:0%
the needs of each individual child
 
05:45:24.708 --> 05:45:24.718 align:start position:0%
the public schools
 
05:45:27.670 --> 05:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
do a good job in general
 
05:45:27.680 --> 05:45:28.628 align:start position:0%
do a good job in general
but

05:45:28.628 --> 05:45:28.638 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:45:28.638 --> 05:45:30.310 align:start position:0%
but
they

05:45:30.310 --> 05:45:30.320 align:start position:0%
they
 
05:45:32.708 --> 05:45:32.718 align:start position:0%
perhaps are not the
 
05:45:34.628 --> 05:45:34.638 align:start position:0%
exact right program
 
05:45:36.390 --> 05:45:36.400 align:start position:0%
for every child
 
05:45:38.470 --> 05:45:38.480 align:start position:0%
i do not want to see
 
05:45:41.670 --> 05:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
this program erode
 
05:45:43.030 --> 05:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
what we're doing
 
05:45:43.040 --> 05:45:44.070 align:start position:0%
what we're doing
for

05:45:44.070 --> 05:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:45:46.470 --> 05:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
the children in our public school
 
05:45:46.480 --> 05:45:47.910 align:start position:0%
the children in our public school
systems

05:45:47.910 --> 05:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
systems
 
05:45:49.590 --> 05:45:49.600 align:start position:0%
i think we can't look at we can't look
 
05:45:51.670 --> 05:45:51.680 align:start position:0%
at one without looking at the whole
 
05:45:51.680 --> 05:45:53.510 align:start position:0%
at one without looking at the whole
overall

05:45:53.510 --> 05:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
overall
 
05:45:53.520 --> 05:45:54.390 align:start position:0%
overall
um

05:45:54.390 --> 05:45:54.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:57.830 --> 05:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
picture here so that's it in a nutshell
 
05:45:59.510 --> 05:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
the accountability
 
05:46:01.670 --> 05:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
the coordination
 
05:46:03.910 --> 05:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
the efficiency
 
05:46:08.150 --> 05:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:09.990 --> 05:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
in my mind
 
05:46:10.000 --> 05:46:11.830 align:start position:0%
in my mind
is

05:46:11.830 --> 05:46:11.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:46:13.350 --> 05:46:13.360 align:start position:0%
far better
 
05:46:15.350 --> 05:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
if we make it a priority most
 
05:46:18.548 --> 05:46:18.558 align:start position:0%
departments when we take on a new idea
 
05:46:20.070 --> 05:46:20.080 align:start position:0%
or a new program
 
05:46:22.390 --> 05:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
that is a major program this is a major
 
05:46:22.400 --> 05:46:23.750 align:start position:0%
that is a major program this is a major
program

05:46:23.750 --> 05:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
program
 
05:46:23.760 --> 05:46:24.788 align:start position:0%
program
i

05:46:24.788 --> 05:46:24.798 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:46:27.110 --> 05:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
are usually done in house
 
05:46:29.190 --> 05:46:29.200 align:start position:0%
very rarely this is kind of an
 
05:46:31.110 --> 05:46:31.120 align:start position:0%
exceptional thing
 
05:46:33.030 --> 05:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
in my mind rarely
 
05:46:33.040 --> 05:46:34.150 align:start position:0%
in my mind rarely
does

05:46:34.150 --> 05:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
does
 
05:46:36.310 --> 05:46:36.320 align:start position:0%
the department of environmental services
 
05:46:38.628 --> 05:46:38.638 align:start position:0%
for instance or any department
 
05:46:39.910 --> 05:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
i think it would be the same for any
 
05:46:39.920 --> 05:46:42.708 align:start position:0%
i think it would be the same for any
department

05:46:42.708 --> 05:46:42.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:45.110 --> 05:46:45.120 align:start position:0%
sort of sub contract
 
05:46:48.310 --> 05:46:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:51.270 --> 05:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
in the private sector to try to develop
 
05:46:53.510 --> 05:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
a state program
 
05:46:55.590 --> 05:46:55.600 align:start position:0%
that's going to affect you can't look at
 
05:46:58.070 --> 05:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
things in a vacuum
 
05:47:02.470 --> 05:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
and that's it in a nutshell i
 
05:47:05.590 --> 05:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
originally wrestled with
 
05:47:05.600 --> 05:47:06.948 align:start position:0%
originally wrestled with
um

05:47:06.948 --> 05:47:06.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:47:09.510 --> 05:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
the education freedom account
 
05:47:11.830 --> 05:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
concept i did
 
05:47:15.190 --> 05:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
because i'm very very vested in my local
 
05:47:17.190 --> 05:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
school district
 
05:47:19.830 --> 05:47:19.840 align:start position:0%
and i worried worried worried
 
05:47:22.230 --> 05:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
about what impact this would have
 
05:47:22.240 --> 05:47:23.510 align:start position:0%
about what impact this would have
on

05:47:23.510 --> 05:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:47:25.590 --> 05:47:25.600 align:start position:0%
our local school
 
05:47:28.628 --> 05:47:28.638 align:start position:0%
and i thought about it a lot and
 
05:47:28.638 --> 05:47:30.788 align:start position:0%
and i thought about it a lot and
i

05:47:30.788 --> 05:47:30.798 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:47:33.510 --> 05:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
just feel the majority of us wanted to
 
05:47:34.788 --> 05:47:34.798 align:start position:0%
try this
 
05:47:36.390 --> 05:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
the majority
 
05:47:36.400 --> 05:47:37.590 align:start position:0%
the majority
of

05:47:37.590 --> 05:47:37.600 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:47:37.600 --> 05:47:38.948 align:start position:0%
of
us

05:47:38.948 --> 05:47:38.958 align:start position:0%
us
 
05:47:42.708 --> 05:47:42.718 align:start position:0%
said this idea is worthy
 
05:47:44.948 --> 05:47:44.958 align:start position:0%
and therefore
 
05:47:48.230 --> 05:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
the last thing in the world
 
05:47:51.110 --> 05:47:51.120 align:start position:0%
i would want to do is to
 
05:47:51.120 --> 05:47:52.230 align:start position:0%
i would want to do is to
to

05:47:52.230 --> 05:47:52.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:47:55.350 --> 05:47:55.360 align:start position:0%
repeal it or be negative about it i want
 
05:47:57.990 --> 05:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
to be positive about it i want to give
 
05:48:00.548 --> 05:48:00.558 align:start position:0%
it a chance and i hope it i hope it
 
05:48:03.350 --> 05:48:03.360 align:start position:0%
totally exceeds my expectations
 
05:48:04.788 --> 05:48:04.798 align:start position:0%
i hope i'm
 
05:48:08.230 --> 05:48:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:08.240 --> 05:48:11.430 align:start position:0%
 
about

05:48:11.430 --> 05:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:13.190 --> 05:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
how many people are going to be
 
05:48:15.030 --> 05:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
interested in this
 
05:48:17.910 --> 05:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
and what impact it's going to have
 
05:48:22.628 --> 05:48:22.638 align:start position:0%
for the 30 out of 288 children let's say
 
05:48:25.190 --> 05:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
in my district to enhance their
 
05:48:27.910 --> 05:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity is a wonderful thing
 
05:48:30.628 --> 05:48:30.638 align:start position:0%
a wonderful thing and if it can be done
 
05:48:34.948 --> 05:48:34.958 align:start position:0%
so that it's not detrimental to the 158
 
05:48:37.350 --> 05:48:37.360 align:start position:0%
left in the school building i'm all for
 
05:48:40.150 --> 05:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
it i am absolutely all for it and i
 
05:48:42.310 --> 05:48:42.320 align:start position:0%
think it can be done i think this is
 
05:48:44.230 --> 05:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
going to be part of our overall
 
05:48:46.070 --> 05:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
educational up this is just the
 
05:48:46.080 --> 05:48:47.430 align:start position:0%
educational up this is just the
beginning

05:48:47.430 --> 05:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
beginning
 
05:48:50.470 --> 05:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
education needs reform we've been
 
05:48:52.628 --> 05:48:52.638 align:start position:0%
a little stale
 
05:48:52.638 --> 05:48:54.708 align:start position:0%
a little stale
recently

05:48:54.708 --> 05:48:54.718 align:start position:0%
recently
 
05:48:56.628 --> 05:48:56.638 align:start position:0%
in our town
 
05:48:59.750 --> 05:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
and we need to look outside the box
 
05:49:01.910 --> 05:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
and offer more opportunities
 
05:49:04.868 --> 05:49:04.878 align:start position:0%
we want our children in new hampshire
 
05:49:06.788 --> 05:49:06.798 align:start position:0%
to be successful
 
05:49:08.788 --> 05:49:08.798 align:start position:0%
at whatever they want to do
 
05:49:11.350 --> 05:49:11.360 align:start position:0%
and one size doesn't fit all
 
05:49:13.910 --> 05:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
and whatever they're interested in i
 
05:49:15.590 --> 05:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
want to be able to afford them that
 
05:49:15.600 --> 05:49:16.948 align:start position:0%
want to be able to afford them that
opportunity

05:49:16.948 --> 05:49:16.958 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
05:49:16.958 --> 05:49:18.230 align:start position:0%
opportunity
to

05:49:18.230 --> 05:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:49:21.510 --> 05:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
learn all about it and do it well
 
05:49:23.990 --> 05:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
and contribute to our economy
 
05:49:26.070 --> 05:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
and to our quality of life here and
 
05:49:28.390 --> 05:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
that's in it in a nutshell
 
05:49:30.548 --> 05:49:30.558 align:start position:0%
i want to make it be a good program and
 
05:49:32.150 --> 05:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
i want it to get off to a very good
 
05:49:32.160 --> 05:49:33.430 align:start position:0%
i want it to get off to a very good
start

05:49:33.430 --> 05:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
start
 
05:49:35.110 --> 05:49:35.120 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
05:49:36.310 --> 05:49:36.320 align:start position:0%
it has
 
05:49:39.270 --> 05:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
more chance of doing that if it's within
 
05:49:41.270 --> 05:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
the department of education
 
05:49:43.910 --> 05:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
and it's within our overall master plan
 
05:49:46.070 --> 05:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
for education you can tell i feel
 
05:49:48.230 --> 05:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
strongly about it and and thank you very
 
05:49:50.868 --> 05:49:50.878 align:start position:0%
much for hearing me out
 
05:49:52.708 --> 05:49:52.718 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much uh
 
05:49:53.990 --> 05:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
representative cordelia did you have
 
05:49:54.948 --> 05:49:54.958 align:start position:0%
your hand up
 
05:49:56.868 --> 05:49:56.878 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman uh thank you
 
05:49:58.868 --> 05:49:58.878 align:start position:0%
for uh sticking around for this bill
 
05:49:58.878 --> 05:49:59.910 align:start position:0%
for uh sticking around for this bill
also

05:49:59.910 --> 05:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
also
 
05:49:59.920 --> 05:50:01.510 align:start position:0%
also
um

05:50:01.510 --> 05:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:50:03.510 --> 05:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
i was just wondering in terms of
 
05:50:06.070 --> 05:50:06.080 align:start position:0%
the legislation and the department of
 
05:50:09.030 --> 05:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
education takeover of the program
 
05:50:10.390 --> 05:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
do you feel
 
05:50:13.110 --> 05:50:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:15.750 --> 05:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
efa legislative oversight committee that
 
05:50:18.150 --> 05:50:18.160 align:start position:0%
we have in place
 
05:50:19.270 --> 05:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
and the
 
05:50:20.948 --> 05:50:20.958 align:start position:0%
contract that
 
05:50:23.350 --> 05:50:23.360 align:start position:0%
the department has put in place
 
05:50:26.070 --> 05:50:26.080 align:start position:0%
with the children scholarship fund
 
05:50:28.230 --> 05:50:28.240 align:start position:0%
are insufficient
 
05:50:30.948 --> 05:50:30.958 align:start position:0%
to monitor the program
 
05:50:30.958 --> 05:50:32.310 align:start position:0%
to monitor the program
i

05:50:32.310 --> 05:50:32.320 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:50:33.830 --> 05:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
i think
 
05:50:36.948 --> 05:50:36.958 align:start position:0%
that if we if we go that route
 
05:50:40.230 --> 05:50:40.240 align:start position:0%
and i'm not saying it might work i'm not
 
05:50:43.830 --> 05:50:43.840 align:start position:0%
i don't know i'm but i'm i'm i'm not as
 
05:50:43.840 --> 05:50:45.670 align:start position:0%
i don't know i'm but i'm i'm i'm not as
confident

05:50:45.670 --> 05:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
confident
 
05:50:45.680 --> 05:50:46.628 align:start position:0%
confident
as

05:50:46.628 --> 05:50:46.638 align:start position:0%
as
 
05:50:48.470 --> 05:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
as i am
 
05:50:51.670 --> 05:50:51.680 align:start position:0%
with the thought that if this is
 
05:50:54.948 --> 05:50:54.958 align:start position:0%
studied if this is administered
 
05:50:57.190 --> 05:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
and is part of the department of
 
05:51:00.390 --> 05:51:00.400 align:start position:0%
education who has a mission
 
05:51:02.868 --> 05:51:02.878 align:start position:0%
to provide an excellent education to all
 
05:51:04.310 --> 05:51:04.320 align:start position:0%
our children
 
05:51:06.150 --> 05:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
and looks at it in conjunction with
 
05:51:08.070 --> 05:51:08.080 align:start position:0%
everything else out there that's being
 
05:51:08.080 --> 05:51:09.030 align:start position:0%
everything else out there that's being
offered

05:51:09.030 --> 05:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
offered
 
05:51:11.110 --> 05:51:11.120 align:start position:0%
and has the oversight
 
05:51:13.510 --> 05:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
of rulemaking and has the oversight of
 
05:51:16.868 --> 05:51:16.878 align:start position:0%
the legislature and has the support

it it
 
05:51:25.590 --> 05:51:25.600 align:start position:0%
is apt to be
 
05:51:28.390 --> 05:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
a better and more successful
 
05:51:28.400 --> 05:51:32.470 align:start position:0%
a better and more successful
program

thank you very much for the question i

05:52:00.718 --> 05:52:01.590 align:start position:0%
know nothing about i know nothing
about

05:52:01.590 --> 05:52:01.600 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:52:04.548 --> 05:52:04.558 align:start position:0%
the entity being proposed to administer
 
05:52:06.830 --> 05:52:06.840 align:start position:0%
this is no reflection on them
 
05:52:09.990 --> 05:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
whatsoever not at all not at all i know
 
05:52:12.788 --> 05:52:12.798 align:start position:0%
nothing about them on purpose i didn't
 
05:52:14.470 --> 05:52:14.480 align:start position:0%
look into
 
05:52:14.480 --> 05:52:15.430 align:start position:0%
look into
um

05:52:15.430 --> 05:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:52:18.070 --> 05:52:18.080 align:start position:0%
what they're about at all i just feel
 
05:52:19.830 --> 05:52:19.840 align:start position:0%
strongly that
 
05:52:22.628 --> 05:52:22.638 align:start position:0%
that this is an important part of what
 
05:52:24.548 --> 05:52:24.558 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire does
 
05:52:24.558 --> 05:52:25.670 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire does
provide

05:52:25.670 --> 05:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
provide
 
05:52:28.470 --> 05:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
and encourage a good education and to me
 
05:52:30.708 --> 05:52:30.718 align:start position:0%
it's important enough it's an important
 
05:52:32.150 --> 05:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
enough mission
 
05:52:33.910 --> 05:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
that we should
 
05:52:35.270 --> 05:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire should give
 
05:52:39.350 --> 05:52:39.360 align:start position:0%
it an awful lot of attention and backing
 
05:52:41.750 --> 05:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
and oversight and
 
05:52:44.788 --> 05:52:44.798 align:start position:0%
monitoring i just i just can't help but
 
05:52:46.470 --> 05:52:46.480 align:start position:0%

05:52:48.310 --> 05:52:48.320 align:start position:0%
a better project
 
05:52:49.510 --> 05:52:49.520 align:start position:0%

05:53:01.510 --> 05:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
a high responsibility
 
05:53:04.708 --> 05:53:04.718 align:start position:0%
a fiduciary responsibility to do a good
 
05:53:07.510 --> 05:53:07.520 align:start position:0%

staffing to do this maybe not
 
05:55:26.708 --> 05:55:26.718 align:start position:0%

you again
 
05:55:51.110 --> 05:55:51.120 align:start position:0%
ms ham representative for joining us
 
05:55:52.948 --> 05:55:52.958 align:start position:0%
this afternoon and bringing this bill
 
05:55:52.958 --> 05:55:55.030 align:start position:0%
this afternoon and bringing this bill
forward

05:55:55.030 --> 05:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
forward
 
05:55:58.628 --> 05:55:58.638 align:start position:0%
the the bill does have a a fiscal note
 
05:56:00.788 --> 05:56:00.798 align:start position:0%
on it and turning to the uh
 
05:56:03.190 --> 05:56:03.200 align:start position:0%
the back page there's not a lot of
 
05:56:06.548 --> 05:56:06.558 align:start position:0%
information uh in the fiscal note
 
05:56:09.990 --> 05:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
um uh other than uh the department sort
 
05:56:12.230 --> 05:56:12.240 align:start position:0%
of wonders whether they would require to
 
05:56:15.030 --> 05:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
build out a technology system and an rfp
 
05:56:17.510 --> 05:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
and coordinate it with the department of
 
05:56:19.910 --> 05:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
of information technology all of the do
 
05:56:19.920 --> 05:56:21.510 align:start position:0%
of information technology all of the do
it

05:56:21.510 --> 05:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:56:22.628 --> 05:56:22.638 align:start position:0%
part there
 
05:56:22.638 --> 05:56:23.430 align:start position:0%
part there
and

05:56:23.430 --> 05:56:23.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:56:25.430 --> 05:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
and that the bill provides neither an
 
05:56:27.270 --> 05:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
appropriation nor authority for new
 
05:56:27.280 --> 05:56:28.390 align:start position:0%
appropriation nor authority for new
personnel

05:56:28.390 --> 05:56:28.400 align:start position:0%
personnel
 
05:56:31.030 --> 05:56:31.040 align:start position:0%
and and i guess it does this
 
05:56:34.070 --> 05:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
um with the backdrop that the um the
 
05:56:36.310 --> 05:56:36.320 align:start position:0%
education freedom account program
 
05:56:39.190 --> 05:56:39.200 align:start position:0%
was uh was budgeted um not even a year
 
05:56:39.200 --> 05:56:40.390 align:start position:0%
was uh was budgeted um not even a year
ago

05:56:40.390 --> 05:56:40.400 align:start position:0%
ago
 
05:56:43.990 --> 05:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
at 129 000 and it's already up over 8.1
 
05:56:45.270 --> 05:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
05:56:47.750 --> 05:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
so given the fact that it's already gone
 
05:56:50.548 --> 05:56:50.558 align:start position:0%
over budget so much do you think that
 
05:56:52.708 --> 05:56:52.718 align:start position:0%
the that the department would be able to
 
05:56:54.788 --> 05:56:54.798 align:start position:0%
find the money to um
 
05:56:58.230 --> 05:56:58.240 align:start position:0%
to uh to provide the implementation of
 
05:57:01.030 --> 05:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
this and possibly even find that money
 
05:57:03.110 --> 05:57:03.120 align:start position:0%
out of the 10 that the scholarship
 
05:57:05.990 --> 05:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
organization retained so the out of the
 
05:57:07.750 --> 05:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
8.1 million
 
05:57:07.760 --> 05:57:08.708 align:start position:0%
8.1 million
um

05:57:08.708 --> 05:57:08.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:57:10.070 --> 05:57:10.080 align:start position:0%
in the program the scholarship
 
05:57:13.670 --> 05:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
organization retains 810 000
 
05:57:13.680 --> 05:57:14.948 align:start position:0%
organization retains 810 000
um

05:57:14.948 --> 05:57:14.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:57:17.510 --> 05:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
for administrative costs um that that
 
05:57:19.190 --> 05:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
the department may be able to find the
 
05:57:19.200 --> 05:57:20.548 align:start position:0%
the department may be able to find the
funds

05:57:20.548 --> 05:57:20.558 align:start position:0%
funds
 
05:57:23.750 --> 05:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your question um
 
05:57:26.868 --> 05:57:26.878 align:start position:0%
thank you and my answer is yes i mean
 
05:57:29.670 --> 05:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
just that ten percent just that amount
 
05:57:31.910 --> 05:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
is a good start
 
05:57:34.390 --> 05:57:34.400 align:start position:0%
and it's going towards
 
05:57:34.400 --> 05:57:36.070 align:start position:0%
and it's going towards
um

05:57:36.070 --> 05:57:36.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:57:38.708 --> 05:57:38.718 align:start position:0%
education you know there isn't a
 
05:57:41.350 --> 05:57:41.360 align:start position:0%
uh we're not outsourcing so there isn't
 
05:57:46.070 --> 05:57:46.080 align:start position:0%
a management fee or something a profit
 
05:57:47.670 --> 05:57:47.680 align:start position:0%
margin in there
 
05:57:47.680 --> 05:57:48.868 align:start position:0%
margin in there
that

05:57:48.868 --> 05:57:48.878 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:57:51.670 --> 05:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
that money would go a long ways towards
 
05:57:53.910 --> 05:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
underwriting this program
 
05:57:53.920 --> 05:57:55.190 align:start position:0%
underwriting this program
and

05:57:55.190 --> 05:57:55.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:57:57.270 --> 05:57:57.280 align:start position:0%
the statistics you just
 
05:57:57.280 --> 05:57:58.548 align:start position:0%
the statistics you just
quoted

05:57:58.548 --> 05:57:58.558 align:start position:0%
quoted
 
05:58:00.150 --> 05:58:00.160 align:start position:0%
tells me
 
05:58:03.590 --> 05:58:03.600 align:start position:0%
this program is going to take off
 
05:58:06.948 --> 05:58:06.958 align:start position:0%
our restorations for the interest in it
 
05:58:09.670 --> 05:58:09.680 align:start position:0%
were grossly underestimated
 
05:58:11.830 --> 05:58:11.840 align:start position:0%
and so that's how important this program
 
05:58:11.840 --> 05:58:12.548 align:start position:0%
and so that's how important this program
is

05:58:12.548 --> 05:58:12.558 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:58:14.070 --> 05:58:14.080 align:start position:0%
this is not
 
05:58:16.548 --> 05:58:16.558 align:start position:0%
going to be a little program
 
05:58:18.788 --> 05:58:18.798 align:start position:0%
that helps 20 kids
 
05:58:20.868 --> 05:58:20.878 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire or whatever
 
05:58:23.750 --> 05:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
it is going to
 
05:58:23.760 --> 05:58:24.948 align:start position:0%
it is going to
challenge

05:58:24.948 --> 05:58:24.958 align:start position:0%
challenge
 
05:58:27.990 --> 05:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
the public school system
 
05:58:30.470 --> 05:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh tremendously
 
05:58:33.430 --> 05:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
and that that isn't a bad thing change
 
05:58:35.350 --> 05:58:35.360 align:start position:0%
is inevitable um
 
05:58:39.030 --> 05:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
and and it's always good to take
 
05:58:40.948 --> 05:58:40.958 align:start position:0%
a second look at what you're doing it's
 
05:58:42.548 --> 05:58:42.558 align:start position:0%
always good to
 
05:58:42.558 --> 05:58:43.350 align:start position:0%
always good to
to

05:58:43.350 --> 05:58:43.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:58:45.510 --> 05:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
challenge the public schools
 
05:58:45.520 --> 05:58:47.430 align:start position:0%
challenge the public schools
to

05:58:47.430 --> 05:58:47.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:58:47.440 --> 05:58:48.788 align:start position:0%
to
continue

05:58:48.788 --> 05:58:48.798 align:start position:0%
continue
 
05:58:48.798 --> 05:58:50.150 align:start position:0%
continue
to

05:58:50.150 --> 05:58:50.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:58:52.830 --> 05:58:52.840 align:start position:0%
improve their offering
 
05:58:55.270 --> 05:58:55.280 align:start position:0%
because this indicates
 
05:58:58.708 --> 05:58:58.718 align:start position:0%
the amount of interest and alternatives
 
05:59:00.948 --> 05:59:00.958 align:start position:0%
to what we're doing right now i don't
 
05:59:03.510 --> 05:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
think we can sit here and have
 
05:59:05.990 --> 05:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
any idea for sure how far this is going
 
05:59:08.070 --> 05:59:08.080 align:start position:0%
to go or whether this is just the
 
05:59:09.830 --> 05:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
beginning of
 
05:59:12.230 --> 05:59:12.240 align:start position:0%
additional educational opportunities for
 
05:59:12.240 --> 05:59:13.350 align:start position:0%
additional educational opportunities for
children

05:59:13.350 --> 05:59:13.360 align:start position:0%
children
 
05:59:15.590 --> 05:59:15.600 align:start position:0%
i agree with you 100 percent
 
05:59:17.910 --> 05:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
that we can find the money we need to
 
05:59:20.470 --> 05:59:20.480 align:start position:0%
find the money to do the job right
 
05:59:22.948 --> 05:59:22.958 align:start position:0%
it needs to be a priority there's very
 
05:59:22.958 --> 05:59:23.750 align:start position:0%
it needs to be a priority there's very
little

05:59:23.750 --> 05:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
little
 
05:59:27.590 --> 05:59:27.600 align:start position:0%
that is more important than education
 
05:59:31.750 --> 05:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:35.030 --> 05:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
yes you may so thanks very much and and
 
05:59:37.110 --> 05:59:37.120 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking um my follow-up
 
05:59:40.470 --> 05:59:40.480 align:start position:0%
question so um would it be fair to say
 
05:59:43.350 --> 05:59:43.360 align:start position:0%
then that that one of your concerns that
 
05:59:45.830 --> 05:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
you just articulated and maybe one of
 
05:59:47.670 --> 05:59:47.680 align:start position:0%
the intents of this bill
 
05:59:49.830 --> 05:59:49.840 align:start position:0%
is also to make sure that all of our
 
05:59:53.110 --> 05:59:53.120 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money is spent on educational
 
05:59:56.390 --> 05:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
purposes and that as this program grows
 
05:59:59.510 --> 05:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
beyond 8.1 million dollars to 20 million
 
06:00:02.948 --> 06:00:02.958 align:start position:0%
dollars to 50 million dollars to 75
 
06:00:04.788 --> 06:00:04.798 align:start position:0%
million dollars that we're not going to
 
06:00:07.270 --> 06:00:07.280 align:start position:0%
be seeing 10 percent of that money
 
06:00:09.510 --> 06:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
7.5 million dollars
 
06:00:09.520 --> 06:00:10.390 align:start position:0%
7.5 million dollars
um

06:00:10.390 --> 06:00:10.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:00:12.868 --> 06:00:12.878 align:start position:0%
going to uh costs not associated with
 
06:00:15.190 --> 06:00:15.200 align:start position:0%
educating new hampshire's kids
 
06:00:18.628 --> 06:00:18.638 align:start position:0%
that that is correct i i
 
06:00:20.948 --> 06:00:20.958 align:start position:0%
i think this program is going to be a
 
06:00:22.628 --> 06:00:22.638 align:start position:0%
huge success
 
06:00:27.190 --> 06:00:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:29.350 --> 06:00:29.360 align:start position:0%
i'm making i'm i i don't want to make
 
06:00:29.360 --> 06:00:30.390 align:start position:0%
i'm making i'm i i don't want to make
any

06:00:30.390 --> 06:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
any
 
06:00:34.390 --> 06:00:34.400 align:start position:0%
reflection on on whomever is interested
 
06:00:37.590 --> 06:00:37.600 align:start position:0%
in managing this account not at all not
 
06:00:39.910 --> 06:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
at all i just think
 
06:00:42.628 --> 06:00:42.638 align:start position:0%
that we need to spend public dollars
 
06:00:45.510 --> 06:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
very very wisely and this is
 
06:00:47.910 --> 06:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
important project that we need to look
 
06:00:47.920 --> 06:00:48.788 align:start position:0%
important project that we need to look
at

06:00:48.788 --> 06:00:48.798 align:start position:0%
at
 
06:00:51.270 --> 06:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
in conjunction with everything
 
06:00:53.510 --> 06:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
else we're doing on the local level and
 
06:00:55.910 --> 06:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
state level to educate our children
 
06:00:58.310 --> 06:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
so i really believe
 
06:01:01.750 --> 06:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
that the money
 
06:01:03.270 --> 06:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
and the oversight
 
06:01:05.270 --> 06:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
of the spending of that money
 
06:01:07.590 --> 06:01:07.600 align:start position:0%
can be better
 
06:01:10.628 --> 06:01:10.638 align:start position:0%
handled in-house
 
06:01:12.830 --> 06:01:12.840 align:start position:0%
i really do
 
06:01:15.350 --> 06:01:15.360 align:start position:0%
think uh that
 
06:01:18.230 --> 06:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
in-house when your focus is
 
06:01:20.868 --> 06:01:20.878 align:start position:0%
and your loyalty and your fiduciary
 
06:01:23.590 --> 06:01:23.600 align:start position:0%
responsibility and everything
 
06:01:26.230 --> 06:01:26.240 align:start position:0%
is to the state of new hampshire
 
06:01:29.030 --> 06:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
and its towns and cities and
 
06:01:31.030 --> 06:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
citizens and children
 
06:01:32.788 --> 06:01:32.798 align:start position:0%
that's your focus
 
06:01:34.310 --> 06:01:34.320 align:start position:0%
not just
 
06:01:36.390 --> 06:01:36.400 align:start position:0%
running one program you got to look at
 
06:01:38.390 --> 06:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
the bigger picture and i think this is
 
06:01:40.150 --> 06:01:40.160 align:start position:0%
something that needs
 
06:01:41.830 --> 06:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
that bigger picture
 
06:01:41.840 --> 06:01:43.830 align:start position:0%
that bigger picture
focus

06:01:43.830 --> 06:01:43.840 align:start position:0%
focus
 
06:01:45.750 --> 06:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
great thank you thank you very much
 
06:01:48.470 --> 06:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli
 
06:01:50.150 --> 06:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
06:01:52.470 --> 06:01:52.480 align:start position:0%
i was just wondering if if you were
 
06:01:54.150 --> 06:01:54.160 align:start position:0%
aware that um
 
06:01:56.708 --> 06:01:56.718 align:start position:0%
based on data reported to the department
 
06:01:58.470 --> 06:01:58.480 align:start position:0%
by school districts
 
06:02:01.670 --> 06:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh the administrative costs for school
 
06:02:04.070 --> 06:02:04.080 align:start position:0%
districts is 10
 
06:02:04.080 --> 06:02:07.270 align:start position:0%
districts is 10
also

06:02:07.270 --> 06:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:09.670 --> 06:02:09.680 align:start position:0%
i know in my town it's much more than
 
06:02:09.680 --> 06:02:10.548 align:start position:0%
i know in my town it's much more than
that

06:02:10.548 --> 06:02:10.558 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:02:12.788 --> 06:02:12.798 align:start position:0%
i can tell you
 
06:02:15.430 --> 06:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
having served on the
 
06:02:17.910 --> 06:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
a school budget committee for well more
 
06:02:20.310 --> 06:02:20.320 align:start position:0%
than 30 years probably
 
06:02:22.830 --> 06:02:22.840 align:start position:0%
and just got off it
 
06:02:26.390 --> 06:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
it's the cost to administer
 
06:02:28.708 --> 06:02:28.718 align:start position:0%
a local school
 
06:02:30.628 --> 06:02:30.638 align:start position:0%
um district
 
06:02:32.150 --> 06:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
is enormous
 
06:02:32.160 --> 06:02:33.750 align:start position:0%
is enormous
enormous

06:02:33.750 --> 06:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
enormous
 
06:02:37.350 --> 06:02:37.360 align:start position:0%
it is a large figure and and our
 
06:02:40.150 --> 06:02:40.160 align:start position:0%
particular our community
 
06:02:41.430 --> 06:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
it is
 
06:02:41.440 --> 06:02:43.910 align:start position:0%
it is
conservatively

06:02:43.910 --> 06:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
conservatively
 
06:02:43.920 --> 06:02:46.070 align:start position:0%
conservatively
one-eighth

06:02:46.070 --> 06:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
one-eighth
 
06:02:47.430 --> 06:02:47.440 align:start position:0%
of the cost
 
06:02:49.430 --> 06:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
to administer our
 
06:02:51.830 --> 06:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
local uh school district and part of the
 
06:02:55.350 --> 06:02:55.360 align:start position:0%
problem is there's only 288 kids
 
06:02:57.110 --> 06:02:57.120 align:start position:0%
we're not big enough we could handle
 
06:02:59.030 --> 06:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
twice as many kids and so therefore the
 
06:03:00.708 --> 06:03:00.718 align:start position:0%
numbers would look better
 
06:03:03.030 --> 06:03:03.040 align:start position:0%
but um
 
06:03:05.830 --> 06:03:05.840 align:start position:0%
i i know it's it's quite costly to
 
06:03:05.840 --> 06:03:07.030 align:start position:0%
i i know it's it's quite costly to
administer

06:03:07.030 --> 06:03:07.040 align:start position:0%
administer
 
06:03:10.868 --> 06:03:10.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:13.430 --> 06:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
further questions representative tanner
 
06:03:16.150 --> 06:03:16.160 align:start position:0%
uh thank you over here again
 
06:03:16.160 --> 06:03:16.948 align:start position:0%
uh thank you over here again
and

06:03:16.948 --> 06:03:16.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:03:18.150 --> 06:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
thanks for serving on the budget
 
06:03:19.910 --> 06:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
committee i'm on one too and it's it's
 
06:03:22.390 --> 06:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
quite a journey thank you um but as i
 
06:03:24.390 --> 06:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
look at the school budget um and
 
06:03:26.390 --> 06:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
probably you do too at our the school
 
06:03:28.868 --> 06:03:28.878 align:start position:0%
that i'm working with our administrative
 
06:03:31.270 --> 06:03:31.280 align:start position:0%
costs are high but it includes
 
06:03:34.070 --> 06:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
transportation it includes the building
 
06:03:37.670 --> 06:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
um you know the curriculum uh
 
06:03:40.470 --> 06:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
the the budget with the with the town
 
06:03:42.150 --> 06:03:42.160 align:start position:0%
and the school board the bond issues a
 
06:03:44.390 --> 06:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
whole lot of other things that that just
 
06:03:46.310 --> 06:03:46.320 align:start position:0%
the cfa program
 
06:03:49.430 --> 06:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh would not entail i think is
 
06:03:52.150 --> 06:03:52.160 align:start position:0%
certainly a fraction of probably what
 
06:03:54.070 --> 06:03:54.080 align:start position:0%
the total costs are for schools would
 
06:03:55.670 --> 06:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
you agree to that
 
06:03:55.680 --> 06:03:58.628 align:start position:0%
you agree to that
um

06:03:58.628 --> 06:03:58.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:02.070 --> 06:04:02.080 align:start position:0%
yes in general our our school is is
 
06:04:05.510 --> 06:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
quite an expensive operation um to to
 
06:04:07.510 --> 06:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
fund we spend
 
06:04:07.520 --> 06:04:08.628 align:start position:0%
fund we spend
um

06:04:08.628 --> 06:04:08.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:04:12.150 --> 06:04:12.160 align:start position:0%
roughly 9 million for 288 children so
 
06:04:14.948 --> 06:04:14.958 align:start position:0%
the numbers i quoted you one-eighth was
 
06:04:16.868 --> 06:04:16.878 align:start position:0%
just for the
 
06:04:16.878 --> 06:04:18.548 align:start position:0%
just for the
strictly

06:04:18.548 --> 06:04:18.558 align:start position:0%
strictly

guidance
 
06:04:24.788 --> 06:04:24.798 align:start position:0%
not transportation not teachers not
 
06:04:26.948 --> 06:04:26.958 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
06:04:28.868 --> 06:04:28.878 align:start position:0%
we're a unique situation because we're
 
06:04:30.868 --> 06:04:30.878 align:start position:0%
small in size
 
06:04:30.878 --> 06:04:32.868 align:start position:0%
small in size
but

06:04:32.868 --> 06:04:32.878 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:04:32.878 --> 06:04:34.310 align:start position:0%
but
it

06:04:34.310 --> 06:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:04:36.548 --> 06:04:36.558 align:start position:0%
i do know
 
06:04:36.558 --> 06:04:38.150 align:start position:0%
i do know
that

06:04:38.150 --> 06:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:04:40.948 --> 06:04:40.958 align:start position:0%
the education budget
 
06:04:42.110 --> 06:04:42.120 align:start position:0%
in our
 
06:04:44.548 --> 06:04:44.558 align:start position:0%
municipalities is
 
06:04:47.190 --> 06:04:47.200 align:start position:0%
larger than the town
 
06:04:49.110 --> 06:04:49.120 align:start position:0%
we spend more on
 
06:04:49.120 --> 06:04:49.910 align:start position:0%
we spend more on
on

06:04:49.910 --> 06:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
on
 
06:04:52.470 --> 06:04:52.480 align:start position:0%
the school than we do on everything else
 
06:04:55.830 --> 06:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
in the town from sewer water highway
 
06:04:57.430 --> 06:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
police fire
 
06:04:59.510 --> 06:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely everything else it
 
06:05:00.868 --> 06:05:00.878 align:start position:0%
it exceeds
 
06:05:02.948 --> 06:05:02.958 align:start position:0%
what we're spending for for all our
 
06:05:06.628 --> 06:05:06.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:08.470 --> 06:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock
 
06:05:09.830 --> 06:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
06:05:11.350 --> 06:05:11.360 align:start position:0%
good afternoon again representative pam
 
06:05:13.750 --> 06:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
thank you and i appreciate this bill it
 
06:05:16.310 --> 06:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
sounds extremely uh thank you forward
 
06:05:19.190 --> 06:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
thinking i i just have a question on the
 
06:05:20.948 --> 06:05:20.958 align:start position:0%
uh effective date
 
06:05:23.030 --> 06:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh i don't look did you have a chance to
 
06:05:24.830 --> 06:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
speak with d.o.e
 
06:05:28.070 --> 06:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
uh let's assume in a positive uh that
 
06:05:30.070 --> 06:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
this was passed did you have the chance
 
06:05:31.670 --> 06:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
to speak with doe to see if the fact
 
06:05:33.670 --> 06:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
that this could be ramped up in time for
 
06:05:36.230 --> 06:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
july 1 or this just as a standard
 
06:05:39.030 --> 06:05:39.040 align:start position:0%
placeholder date uh no i did not i did
 
06:05:41.190 --> 06:05:41.200 align:start position:0%
not consult with them and that
 
06:05:44.150 --> 06:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
probably is quite ambitious i would
 
06:05:44.160 --> 06:05:45.030 align:start position:0%
probably is quite ambitious i would
think

06:05:45.030 --> 06:05:45.040 align:start position:0%
think
 
06:05:48.070 --> 06:05:48.080 align:start position:0%
that the effective date might
 
06:05:49.910 --> 06:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
have to be beyond that
 
06:05:52.708 --> 06:05:52.718 align:start position:0%
okay that's just a date we
 
06:05:54.708 --> 06:05:54.718 align:start position:0%
we picked but
 
06:05:56.948 --> 06:05:56.958 align:start position:0%
i agree uh
 
06:05:58.628 --> 06:05:58.638 align:start position:0%
i don't think there's any way we can get
 
06:05:59.910 --> 06:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
it done by
 
06:06:02.230 --> 06:06:02.240 align:start position:0%
july 1.
 
06:06:03.830 --> 06:06:03.840 align:start position:0%

06:08:06.628 --> 06:08:06.638 align:start position:0%
know
 
06:08:08.628 --> 06:08:08.638 align:start position:0%
is it is the list of bills that we're
 
06:08:08.638 --> 06:08:09.910 align:start position:0%
is it is the list of bills that we're
executing

06:08:09.910 --> 06:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
executing
 
06:08:11.670 --> 06:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
available to the public i know when
 
06:08:12.868 --> 06:08:12.878 align:start position:0%
you're printed in the calendar the
 
06:08:22.070 --> 06:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:23.990 --> 06:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
picking bills may just occur right after
 
06:08:26.788 --> 06:08:26.798 align:start position:0%
we hear the bill or they can pop up at
 
06:08:29.430 --> 06:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
any time um
 
06:08:31.110 --> 06:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
what i'm trying to do is work with all
 
06:08:32.548 --> 06:08:32.558 align:start position:0%
the people here knowing here's where
 
06:08:33.750 --> 06:08:33.760 align:start position:0%
we're going
 
06:08:35.750 --> 06:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
executive sessions are not for the
 
06:08:35.760 --> 06:08:37.190 align:start position:0%
executive sessions are not for the
public

06:08:37.190 --> 06:08:37.200 align:start position:0%
public
 
06:08:39.190 --> 06:08:39.200 align:start position:0%
executive sessions are for this group
 
06:08:41.190 --> 06:08:41.200 align:start position:0%
right here to make we've already had our
 
06:08:42.868 --> 06:08:42.878 align:start position:0%
hearing every one of the bills we exec
 
06:08:44.390 --> 06:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
has been heard
 
06:08:46.788 --> 06:08:46.798 align:start position:0%
now there's occasion when we may ask for
 
06:08:49.350 --> 06:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
some technical support during a exact
 
06:08:51.670 --> 06:08:51.680 align:start position:0%
session that's not uncommon it's been
 
06:08:54.310 --> 06:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
done by every chair that i can remember
 
06:08:57.110 --> 06:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
working with but there again too
 
06:08:57.120 --> 06:08:58.150 align:start position:0%
working with but there again too
um

06:08:58.150 --> 06:08:58.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:09:00.708 --> 06:09:00.718 align:start position:0%
the the uh
 
06:09:02.070 --> 06:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
the public
 
06:09:04.230 --> 06:09:04.240 align:start position:0%
really has to give their input
 
06:09:06.868 --> 06:09:06.878 align:start position:0%
on the hearing side but there are people
 
06:09:08.708 --> 06:09:08.718 align:start position:0%
who are invested
 
06:09:10.948 --> 06:09:10.958 align:start position:0%
in these issues and
 
06:09:13.270 --> 06:09:13.280 align:start position:0%
curious as to when a decision is going
 
06:09:15.830 --> 06:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
to be made and if if they don't know
 
06:09:18.150 --> 06:09:18.160 align:start position:0%
when it's going to be
 
06:09:20.948 --> 06:09:20.958 align:start position:0%
exact they they don't get an opportunity
 
06:09:22.788 --> 06:09:22.798 align:start position:0%
to watch us doing that work and that's
 
06:09:24.548 --> 06:09:24.558 align:start position:0%
quite possible seeing that so and that
 
06:09:26.708 --> 06:09:26.718 align:start position:0%
will be quite possible this year or this
 
06:09:29.430 --> 06:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
session as well we may get down after we
 
06:09:31.830 --> 06:09:31.840 align:start position:0%
come back after the the first session
 
06:09:33.430 --> 06:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
down in manchester
 
06:09:36.230 --> 06:09:36.240 align:start position:0%
and get into some bills have a real hole
 
06:09:37.750 --> 06:09:37.760 align:start position:0%
and we're just going to start executing
 
06:09:40.070 --> 06:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
bills um that's the only way we're going
 
06:09:41.350 --> 06:09:41.360 align:start position:0%
to get out of here and that's the only
 
06:09:43.350 --> 06:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
time way we're going to get these 102
 
06:09:45.110 --> 06:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
bills completed
 
06:09:47.430 --> 06:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
by the 17th of march
 
06:09:49.350 --> 06:09:49.360 align:start position:0%
it's going to slide on us very quickly
 
06:09:49.360 --> 06:09:51.670 align:start position:0%
it's going to slide on us very quickly
here

06:09:51.670 --> 06:09:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:53.830 --> 06:09:53.840 align:start position:0%
it's coming
 
06:09:55.750 --> 06:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
so ralph
 
06:09:57.910 --> 06:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
it looks like municipal county is going
 
06:09:59.830 --> 06:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
to be on the ninth foot but it looks
 
06:10:02.628 --> 06:10:02.638 align:start position:0%
like our bill's gonna be on the 15th
 
06:10:02.638 --> 06:10:03.670 align:start position:0%
like our bill's gonna be on the 15th
from

06:10:03.670 --> 06:10:03.680 align:start position:0%
from
 
06:10:07.750 --> 06:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
what we were supposed to do on friday
 
06:10:09.510 --> 06:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
yeah what we're doing on friday we're
 
06:10:11.350 --> 06:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
going to be doing on the 15th yeah we
