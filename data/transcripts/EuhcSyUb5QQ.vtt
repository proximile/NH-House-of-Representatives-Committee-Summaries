00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:28.910 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 align:start position:0%

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 align:start position:0%
okay good morning everybody um we're
 
00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 align:start position:0%
going to open up our first uh hearing
 
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.869 align:start position:0%
going to open up our first uh hearing
for

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:25.879 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
today uh for those in the public it's uh
 
00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
or it's 9:30 obviously you can read the
 
00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
clock just as well as I can but I want
 
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 align:start position:0%
to remind people on the committee here
 
00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:39.879 align:start position:0%
that are just inform you that yesterday
 
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 align:start position:0%
we s received a slug of slug of more
 
00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 align:start position:0%
bills here and so we now this committee
 
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 align:start position:0%
has 21 early bills which we have to deal
 
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
with by March 6 and I was just over
 
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
talking with the finance people over in
 
00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 align:start position:0%
the other building on the bottom level
 
00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
there uh with Mickey and um they're
 
00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 align:start position:0%
being swamped with fiscal report trying
 
00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
to get them all together and uh they
 
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 align:start position:0%
still don't have the fiscal notes on
 
00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 align:start position:0%
many of these bills and fact they don't
 
00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 align:start position:0%
even know they don't even have all the
 
00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 align:start position:0%
bills that have been released by OS yet
 
00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
so um it's uh that's putting a crunch
 
00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
and the time frames for submitting
 
00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 align:start position:0%
legislation need to change because it's
 
00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
just getting impossible for us to do
 
00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
what we need to do and and get the
 
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets that I just requested uh so
 
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
it is 9:30 and we're going to open up HB
 
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 align:start position:0%
295 this is a bill making School
 
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 align:start position:0%
building Aid programs funds
 
00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 align:start position:0%
non-aps and I'd like to welcome
 
00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.030 align:start position:0%
non-aps and I'd like to welcome
representa

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 align:start position:0%
representa
 
00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 align:start position:0%
kahill thank you Mr chairman uh my name
 
00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 align:start position:0%
is Michael kahill I represent Rockingham
 
00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 align:start position:0%
10 the towns of newfields and New Market
 
00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 align:start position:0%
and um you may recall last week we we
 
00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 align:start position:0%
talked about HB 366 which also has this
 
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
language but just in case you don't pass
 
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
that bill I brought 295 which only has
 
00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 align:start position:0%
this language making building Aid non-
 
00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:11.599 align:start position:0%
laabs and and the reason we'd like to do
 
00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
that is because if there's money left
 
00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
over that wasn't used either uh the
 
00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 align:start position:0%
community didn't pass their warrant
 
00:04:20.749 --> 00:04:20.759 align:start position:0%
article or there was just some change
 
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 align:start position:0%
back from your dollar every every little
 
00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 align:start position:0%
bit we can save for the following bium
 
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
could make a difference it could be that
 
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 align:start position:0%
we do a we might have a million or two
 
00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
to do
 
00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 align:start position:0%
a small project maybe it could even be
 
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 align:start position:0%
moved from number 28 on the list to uh
 
00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
to Next in order because the money would
 
00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:41.039 align:start position:0%
be there and failing that there would be
 
00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
just a little bit more money to allow us
 
00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
to work harder on this list which I know
 
00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
you still have from the other
 
00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 align:start position:0%
Bill and uh or the other list that uh
 
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 align:start position:0%
you still have from the other
 
00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 align:start position:0%
Bill we just we haven't put the money in
 
00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 align:start position:0%
and any way we can get a little bit more
 
00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:01.639 align:start position:0%
money into this you know as Senator ever
 
00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:03.759 align:start position:0%
derkson said a million here a million
 
00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:05.199 align:start position:0%
there before you know what you're
 
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 align:start position:0%
talking real money and we do need some
 
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 align:start position:0%
real money dedicated to this program and
 
00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
uh this is just one way to get a little
 
00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 align:start position:0%
bit more to help fix those schools that
 
00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 align:start position:0%
we know need
 
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
fixing thank you that didn't take seven
 
00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
minutes after all okay thank you very
 
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
much are there any questions from the
 
00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680 align:start position:0%
committee members yes rep representative
 
00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 align:start position:0%
McGuire thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 align:start position:0%
do you have figures for the past X years
 
00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 align:start position:0%
of how much has
 
00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
lapsed that's a very good question and
 
00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
it didn't come to me until late last
 
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
night so I have made a request and when
 
00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:45.160 align:start position:0%
I get it I will certainly get it to you
 
00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 align:start position:0%
and I I know there wouldn't have been
 
00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
any during the moratorium but in recent
 
00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
years and perhaps you know the decade
 
00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080 align:start position:0%
before the moratorium it might be
 
00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:55.039 align:start position:0%
interesting to know how much we're
 
00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
talking about but there there were there
 
00:05:59.870 --> 00:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
would have been some lapses and every
 
00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
little bit helps yeah we can ask the LBA
 
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
followup please yes go ahead thank you
 
00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:09.400 align:start position:0%
so um I believe that the education fund
 
00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:12.680 align:start position:0%
as a whole is non-aps and these monies
 
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
come from the education fund do you am I
 
00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:19.280 align:start position:0%
correct to your knowledge um I believe
 
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
that the building Aid is is separate
 
00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:25.280 align:start position:0%
from the education trust fund otherwise
 
00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:27.880 align:start position:0%
I my understanding was that we can't put
 
00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
the Surplus that we had
 
00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:32.240 align:start position:0%
bu in the education trust fund toward
 
00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:34.360 align:start position:0%
any of the projects in building Aid I
 
00:06:36.309 --> 00:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
mean I'm I thought it was a separate pot
 
00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:39.160 align:start position:0%
of money uh or unless it's just because
 
00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
of the $50 million Max which we're
 
00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:43.919 align:start position:0%
trying to address in 366 that we that we
 
00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:46.199 align:start position:0%
can't do it but I think it is a separate
 
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
separate money we didn't do we didn't
 
00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
include uh building Aid in the education
 
00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
trust fund because we had because we
 
00:06:54.309 --> 00:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
already had building Aid we didn't
 
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:55.800 align:start position:0%
include an
 
00:06:58.990 --> 00:06:59.000 align:start position:0%
adequacy thank you I do have a question
 
00:07:00.309 --> 00:07:00.319 align:start position:0%
on that
 
00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
um within the statute we have the the
 
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:07.560 align:start position:0%
wording that the upcoming projects the
 
00:07:09.309 --> 00:07:09.319 align:start position:0%
next one on the list and let's say we
 
00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:12.280 align:start position:0%
have $15 million left in that project
 
00:07:15.749 --> 00:07:15.759 align:start position:0%
the state share would be let's say 23
 
00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:18.440 align:start position:0%
million they have the option of taking
 
00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:21.160 align:start position:0%
that 15 million and using that for that
 
00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:23.800 align:start position:0%
project or rejecting it and you move on
 
00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:26.639 align:start position:0%
down the list and you find a project
 
00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:29.720 align:start position:0%
that might fit th those needs I was
 
00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:32.800 align:start position:0%
under the in that's how this money was
 
00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:36.280 align:start position:0%
being spent other words our our debt
 
00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
right now coming up for FY 26 is roughly
 
00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:42.639 align:start position:0%
and and I see the department is here uh
 
00:07:47.909 --> 00:07:47.919 align:start position:0%
around um 21.8 or some somewhere in that
 
00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:51.720 align:start position:0%
neighborhood and that that leaves you
 
00:07:54.909 --> 00:07:54.919 align:start position:0%
know 20.1 or something such that where
 
00:07:58.230 --> 00:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
we end up with about 28.9 million for
 
00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:02.280 align:start position:0%
construction right I've not heard that
 
00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
the money reverts back to the state I
 
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
thought that stay and maybe uh if you're
 
00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
unaware of that then maybe we could ask
 
00:08:13.029 --> 00:08:13.039 align:start position:0%
the department to give us some
 
00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:16.520 align:start position:0%
information on that uh yes um Mr chair I
 
00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
think this this was a request from our
 
00:08:22.589 --> 00:08:22.599 align:start position:0%
the previous uh administrator Amy
 
00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
Clark so I I uh there may be some
 
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
mechanism I know the the tail is getting
 
00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
shorter and shorter which is good which
 
00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
also is another means of getting us more
 
00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
money ability if it's if we in fact fund
 
00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:38.919 align:start position:0%
the program but I believe this uh this
 
00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:41.320 align:start position:0%
was a request that this would make a
 
00:08:43.509 --> 00:08:43.519 align:start position:0%
difference so I I believe from that
 
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
perspective that uh Amy Clark felt that
 
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
this uh was necessary okay thank you
 
00:08:51.949 --> 00:08:51.959 align:start position:0%
forther repres
 
00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:55.800 align:start position:0%
pellow thank you Mr chair um I I don't
 
00:08:59.590 --> 00:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
know if you can answer this question but
 
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:02.800 align:start position:0%
um having been on ways and means I know
 
00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
that there's a long list of funds that
 
00:09:08.829 --> 00:09:08.839 align:start position:0%
that are dedicated funds and you can
 
00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:11.800 align:start position:0%
they can be designated lapsing or
 
00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:18.440 align:start position:0%
non-lps so one way to keep this money
 
00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
accomplish what you're saying you want
 
00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:23.640 align:start position:0%
to accomplish would be to have it go
 
00:09:26.269 --> 00:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
into um the appropriation from general
 
00:09:30.069 --> 00:09:30.079 align:start position:0%
fund go into a a dedicated fund
 
00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:32.680 align:start position:0%
and then you can make the fund non-aps
 
00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
so I agree with you know what you're
 
00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:39.240 align:start position:0%
trying to do um dick and I we're just
 
00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
both from Ways and Means and um we're
 
00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:45.160 align:start position:0%
not 100% sure but we want to look at
 
00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
that possibility to set it up that way
 
00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
to achieve what this is trying to
 
00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
do um I'm I'm not uh steeped in the ways
 
00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
of ways and means but I know there there
 
00:09:59.470 --> 00:09:59.480 align:start position:0%
are people who have an aversion to dedic
 
00:10:03.829 --> 00:10:03.839 align:start position:0%
ated funds who are uh powerful pembers
 
00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
of the finance committee so I whatever
 
00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:09.880 align:start position:0%
way will work best that's the path uh I
 
00:10:11.269 --> 00:10:11.279 align:start position:0%
would appreciate you would take are
 
00:10:14.069 --> 00:10:14.079 align:start position:0%
there any other questions in that case I
 
00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:15.160 align:start position:0%
want to thank you for coming and
 
00:10:17.269 --> 00:10:17.279 align:start position:0%
bringing that to us I'd like to invite
 
00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
the department up if they're able to
 
00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:21.720 align:start position:0%
answer some of our questions excellent
 
00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.269 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:10:30.269 --> 00:10:30.279 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
good morning excuse me good
 
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:34.720 align:start position:0%

of Education good morning Mr Carney uh
 
00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:40.240 align:start position:0%
Carney um I know you're you're stepping
 
00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
into the shoes of Amy Clark correct yeah
 
00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:45.160 align:start position:0%
some big shoes uh but could you help us
 
00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:47.519 align:start position:0%
out a little bit on the issue that we
 
00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
just been discussing in terms of laps
 
00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:51.030 align:start position:0%
just been discussing in terms of laps
versus

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
versus
 
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
non-aps yeah so a couple um points um
 
00:10:57.629 --> 00:10:57.639 align:start position:0%
your number was correct uh the
 
00:11:00.069 --> 00:11:00.079 align:start position:0%
29.1 would be what would be available if
 
00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:02.839 align:start position:0%
it's uh School building ID is funded to
 
00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
the 50 million uh maximum for 26 you
 
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned that um also it's my
 
00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:10.360 align:start position:0%
understanding that it is from the
 
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
education trust fund that is a source of
 
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
funds for school building Aid um and I
 
00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
can also uh reiterate what
 
00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
representative kahill mentioned that Amy
 
00:11:22.389 --> 00:11:22.399 align:start position:0%
Clark did um mentioned to me that it
 
00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:25.480 align:start position:0%
would be important in her mind to have
 
00:11:28.949 --> 00:11:28.959 align:start position:0%
this become a non-aps fund because the
 
00:11:31.269 --> 00:11:31.279 align:start position:0%
fund currently do lapse
 
00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:34.240 align:start position:0%
back and do you have uh information or
 
00:11:37.269 --> 00:11:37.279 align:start position:0%
can you get a hold of information and uh
 
00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
represent McGuire's asked okay what's
 
00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
this look like in far as those non those
 
00:11:46.629 --> 00:11:46.639 align:start position:0%
lapsing dollars over the last decade yes
 
00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:48.200 align:start position:0%
well I decade I'm matter because it's
 
00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.310 align:start position:0%
well I decade I'm matter because it's
all

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:52.600 align:start position:0%
moratorium so going recently and then
 
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
prior to correct yeah so we received a
 
00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
request uh late yesterday for that
 
00:11:59.310 --> 00:11:59.320 align:start position:0%
information and so I'm working with the
 
00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:01.480 align:start position:0%
director Davis on having our business
 
00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:05.560 align:start position:0%
office uh get that information and 2004
 
00:12:08.069 --> 00:12:08.079 align:start position:0%
and one last question for you y um from
 
00:12:11.829 --> 00:12:11.839 align:start position:0%
me the others are welcome um has there
 
00:12:13.949 --> 00:12:13.959 align:start position:0%
been any thought if there is lapsing
 
00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
dollar available to use that to pay off
 
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.189 align:start position:0%
dollar available to use that to pay off
the

00:12:17.189 --> 00:12:17.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:12:20.629 --> 00:12:20.639 align:start position:0%
debt uh I can't pay off yeah that would
 
00:12:23.949 --> 00:12:23.959 align:start position:0%
be a legislative decision yeah represent
 
00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
McGuire thank you can you answer my
 
00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:29.720 align:start position:0%
other question does this lapse to the
 
00:12:31.949 --> 00:12:31.959 align:start position:0%
education trust fund or to the general
 
00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:35.320 align:start position:0%
fund and and also is the education trust
 
00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:38.680 align:start position:0%
fund itself non-aps I think I cannot
 
00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:40.240 align:start position:0%
answer those questions unfortunately I
 
00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
can't get you those answers though I the
 
00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
education trust is non that's what I
 
00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:48.680 align:start position:0%
thought that
 
00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
raises yeah yeah Mr chair and and I
 
00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
think it goes to representative
 
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
Maguire's earlier question about the
 
00:12:56.829 --> 00:12:56.839 align:start position:0%
source of the funds because if the ETF
 
00:12:56.839 --> 00:12:57.629 align:start position:0%
source of the funds because if the ETF
is

00:12:57.629 --> 00:12:57.639 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
non-aps and and this and building Aid
 
00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:03.160 align:start position:0%
comes out of the education trust
 
00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
fund yeah then it's already non-lps and
 
00:13:09.829 --> 00:13:09.839 align:start position:0%
so well in a way not specifically for
 
00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:12.040 align:start position:0%
building aid but for for the fund in
 
00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:15.160 align:start position:0%
general in general so I yeah I think
 
00:13:18.069 --> 00:13:18.079 align:start position:0%
there's a lot we need to thank you Mr Mr
 
00:13:19.629 --> 00:13:19.639 align:start position:0%
chairman can I follow up or ask a
 
00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:21.240 align:start position:0%
different question yes you may and then
 
00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:23.480 align:start position:0%
represent excuse me represent pH had her
 
00:13:25.069 --> 00:13:25.079 align:start position:0%
hand I don't if she's following up on
 
00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:27.240 align:start position:0%
what we were discussing yeah so I'm
 
00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
pretty sure I'm I can't say 100% but I'm
 
00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:32.360 align:start position:0%
pretty sure that the building Aid is not
 
00:13:34.829 --> 00:13:34.839 align:start position:0%
in the trust fund this I didn't quite
 
00:13:37.189 --> 00:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
hear the last part I'm I'm pretty sure
 
00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:40.720 align:start position:0%
that the Ed that building Aid is not
 
00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:56.829 --> 00:13:56.839 align:start position:0%
it okay represent McGuire thank you yeah
 
00:13:58.389 --> 00:13:58.399 align:start position:0%
I'm maybe I'm wrong about that that
 
00:14:00.389 --> 00:14:00.399 align:start position:0%
that's what I read at some point but
 
00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:02.519 align:start position:0%
anyways let me ask you slightly a
 
00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
different qu question besides your
 
00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:09.320 align:start position:0%
yourself um or maybe not even yourself
 
00:14:11.509 --> 00:14:11.519 align:start position:0%
how many employees does the department
 
00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:14.120 align:start position:0%
have that are dedicated to the building
 
00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
Aid um process so I would say we have
 
00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
four employees in the Bureau of school
 
00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:23.680 align:start position:0%
facilities and I work on school building
 
00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
Aid in part and then we have one other
 
00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:28.440 align:start position:0%
employee that does uh much of the
 
00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
accounting site of it and reimbursements
 
00:14:33.629 --> 00:14:33.639 align:start position:0%
and so forth so and that's most of her
 
00:14:38.629 --> 00:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
full-time job so I'd say 1.5
 
00:14:42.269 --> 00:14:42.279 align:start position:0%
1.75 any further questions at this time
 
00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:44.120 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:14:46.389 --> 00:14:46.399 align:start position:0%
department not seeing any
 
00:14:48.749 --> 00:14:48.759 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you very much
 
00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
are there any other pink
 
00:14:52.509 --> 00:14:52.519 align:start position:0%
cards do you have one last comment
 
00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:00.440 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you Mr Mr chair I believe
 
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
there was some discussion about being
 
00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:04.680 align:start position:0%
able to pay down the debt that you the
 
00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:08.440 align:start position:0%
tail and that wasn't possible uh because
 
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
of the bond agreements that you can't
 
00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:13.160 align:start position:0%
just pay it off and be done with it as
 
00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:19.880 align:start position:0%
be anything is
 
00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:22.160 align:start position:0%
possible okay we're seeing that in our
 
00:15:24.269 --> 00:15:24.279 align:start position:0%

close this down and we can't start oh
 
00:15:39.389 --> 00:15:39.399 align:start position:0%
represent dick looking at the
 
00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
uh thank you I was just looking at the
 
00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:46.440 align:start position:0%
um education trust fund statute and just
 
00:15:49.629 --> 00:15:49.639 align:start position:0%
to say that it does have as one of
 
00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
its um compartments subc compartments uh
 
00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:57.480 align:start position:0%

statute so that's there I I don't know I
 
00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
don't know how it's used
 
00:16:09.389 --> 00:16:09.399 align:start position:0%
but yeah we we'll ask
 
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
LBA that's what we got to do allowed
 
00:16:15.069 --> 00:16:15.079 align:start position:0%

other day but uh so we're closing down
 
00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:21.160 align:start position:0%
uh this hearing and we'll start the next
 
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:31.880 align:start position:0%
yeah if I get a
 
00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
response on on all these we're going to
 
00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
have a work session um we we just got to
 
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
get through these early bills get them
 
00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
heard and then get the work sessions
 
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
going on these various topics and that's
 
00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:46.720 align:start position:0%
going to take a lot of work and a lot of
 
00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:49.240 align:start position:0%
time I was up to one o'clock last night
 
00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:52.440 align:start position:0%
working on this stuff and it's it
 
00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of lot of ends that have
 
00:16:57.629 --> 00:16:57.639 align:start position:0%
to be tied together here so so we're on
 
00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:25.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:27.830 --> 00:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
so I think I
 
00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:57.830 align:start position:0%
so I think I
read

00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:27.750 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:27.760 align:start position:0%

00:32:08.549 --> 00:32:08.559 align:start position:0%
Bill 237 prohibiting the use of special
 
00:32:11.269 --> 00:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
education State funds and differentiated
 
00:32:14.029 --> 00:32:14.039 align:start position:0%
Aid special education funds on students

um yeah I I actually did read this bill
 
00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
so I could say something about it
 
00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:29.000 align:start position:0%
because it didn't strike me as um
 
00:32:31.549 --> 00:32:31.559 align:start position:0%
well McGuire if you want to start
 
00:32:33.549 --> 00:32:33.559 align:start position:0%

one then okay uh Becky Wilson from the
 
00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:22.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:24.549 --> 00:33:24.559 align:start position:0%
Association good morning chairman lad
 
00:33:27.029 --> 00:33:27.039 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee uh for
 
00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
those of you I haven't met previously I
 
00:33:30.789 --> 00:33:30.799 align:start position:0%
am Becky Wilson uh director of
 
00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
governmental relations for the New
 
00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school boards
 
00:33:35.789 --> 00:33:35.799 align:start position:0%
Association uh we are opposed to this
 
00:33:38.029 --> 00:33:38.039 align:start position:0%
bill the way that it's currently uh
 
00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:40.360 align:start position:0%
presented we feel the bill is perhaps
 
00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
unnecessary it's also unclear as to
 
00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
exactly what the sponsors of this bill
 
00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:47.200 align:start position:0%
are trying to formalize uh we certainly
 
00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
want to be sensitive to the underlying
 
00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
concern of making sure that students
 
00:33:53.669 --> 00:33:53.679 align:start position:0%
with uh eligibility for special
 
00:33:56.029 --> 00:33:56.039 align:start position:0%
education are receiving the services
 
00:33:57.310 --> 00:33:57.320 align:start position:0%
that they need in order to make
 
00:33:59.710 --> 00:33:59.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate progress but we're not sure
 
00:34:01.389 --> 00:34:01.399 align:start position:0%
this bill is something that can be
 
00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
implemented to really meet the spirit of
 
00:34:06.549 --> 00:34:06.559 align:start position:0%
that um it's a little bit questionable
 
00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
from our first reading about whether or
 
00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:10.520 align:start position:0%
not this is just for the differentiated
 
00:34:14.629 --> 00:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
Aid um adequacy monies uh those as you
 
00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:17.399 align:start position:0%
know are provided to districts quarterly
 
00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
as a lumpsum payment it's not parsed out
 
00:34:23.629 --> 00:34:23.639 align:start position:0%
in terms of this is your base adequacy
 
00:34:26.069 --> 00:34:26.079 align:start position:0%
Aid this is your differentiated Aid um
 
00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
it's based on your admr um those
 
00:34:30.629 --> 00:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
adequacy monies are used throughout the
 
00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:33.560 align:start position:0%
operating budget uh for the district
 
00:34:35.669 --> 00:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
it's fairly easy for people to see the
 
00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
line items that are within a School
 
00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
District budget that would be applicable
 
00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:40.760 align:start position:0%
to special education those are primarily
 
00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
your 1200 lines in most operating
 
00:34:46.109 --> 00:34:46.119 align:start position:0%
budgets um while a majority of the
 
00:34:47.669 --> 00:34:47.679 align:start position:0%
operating budget for special ed would
 
00:34:49.629 --> 00:34:49.639 align:start position:0%
include staff or specific training or
 
00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:51.320 align:start position:0%
curriculum for specially designed
 
00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:53.560 align:start position:0%
instruction there certainly are things
 
00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
such as specialized
 
00:34:57.230 --> 00:34:57.240 align:start position:0%
Transportation uh training for regular
 
00:34:58.710 --> 00:34:58.720 align:start position:0%
education teachers to be able to
 
00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:01.320 align:start position:0%
implement required aspects of a child's
 
00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
IEP perhaps staff who work primarily
 
00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
with students who are eligible for
 
00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
special education but may also share
 
00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:09.560 align:start position:0%
some aspects of their time with students
 
00:35:11.829 --> 00:35:11.839 align:start position:0%
who are not eligible or maybe not yet
 
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
eligible um as you may know such as a
 
00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
school psychologist um those people may
 
00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:20.680 align:start position:0%
be funded partially um in the operating
 
00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
budget with differentiated Aid monies
 
00:35:24.589 --> 00:35:24.599 align:start position:0%
although it's not parsed out that way in
 
00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:27.320 align:start position:0%
terms of budgeting um but they may also
 
00:35:29.349 --> 00:35:29.359 align:start position:0%
work with students who are not eligible
 
00:35:31.589 --> 00:35:31.599 align:start position:0%
for special education uh we also have
 
00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
students who are referred for special
 
00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
education who technically would not be
 
00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
considered students for special
 
00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:39.240 align:start position:0%
education at that time but whom special
 
00:35:40.829 --> 00:35:40.839 align:start position:0%
education staff would be working with
 
00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:43.240 align:start position:0%
them to do the evaluations and determine
 
00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
whether or not they are eligible what
 
00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:47.640 align:start position:0%
would that mean for those staff um
 
00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
evaluation tools things like that it's
 
00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:53.480 align:start position:0%
also slightly unclear if this would also
 
00:35:55.750 --> 00:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
apply to any other grant funding it does
 
00:35:57.950 --> 00:35:57.960 align:start position:0%
say adequacy grants specifically but is
 
00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
there any aspect of this about the idea
 
00:36:02.309 --> 00:36:02.319 align:start position:0%
grants that are given to districts um
 
00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:03.880 align:start position:0%
how those are used those activities are
 
00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
already all approved by the department
 
00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
of Ed um to make sure that they are
 
00:36:11.349 --> 00:36:11.359 align:start position:0%
approvable eligible activities um as
 
00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
related to special ed in the district
 
00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:14.240 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to answer any questions
 
00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much other questions yes
 
00:36:19.309 --> 00:36:19.319 align:start position:0%
represent luno thanks very much Mr chair
 
00:36:21.589 --> 00:36:21.599 align:start position:0%
thank you very much M Wilson how do
 
00:36:23.829 --> 00:36:23.839 align:start position:0%
districts currently track the use of uh
 
00:36:23.839 --> 00:36:25.510 align:start position:0%
districts currently track the use of uh
Revenue

00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
dollars thank you for the question um
 
00:36:29.309 --> 00:36:29.319 align:start position:0%
you know certainly Revenue that comes
 
00:36:31.829 --> 00:36:31.839 align:start position:0%
into the district um as you've all
 
00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
passed recently you know needs to be
 
00:36:35.349 --> 00:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
posted on the district's website in
 
00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:37.240 align:start position:0%
terms of what revenues are coming in the
 
00:36:39.069 --> 00:36:39.079 align:start position:0%
majority of revenues so to speak in the
 
00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
operating budget I mean those are all
 
00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:43.960 align:start position:0%
included in the day-to-day budget the
 
00:36:46.069 --> 00:36:46.079 align:start position:0%
school board has to sign off on that
 
00:36:48.990 --> 00:36:49.000 align:start position:0%
monthly when bills are being paid Etc
 
00:36:52.829 --> 00:36:52.839 align:start position:0%
through payroll and things like that um
 
00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
is there a specific question about
 
00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
special ed funding yeah yeah so so
 
00:37:01.349 --> 00:37:01.359 align:start position:0%
thanks so so so I guess um use of of of
 
00:37:03.349 --> 00:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
let's say in this case State revenues
 
00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
that were associated with a student um
 
00:37:08.589 --> 00:37:08.599 align:start position:0%
as part of the adequacy funding formula
 
00:37:09.309 --> 00:37:09.319 align:start position:0%
so we're talking about the
 
00:37:11.950 --> 00:37:11.960 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid um you know in the
 
00:37:17.069 --> 00:37:17.079 align:start position:0%
adequacy funding formula um do we do we
 
00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
track state or you know revenues that
 
00:37:21.829 --> 00:37:21.839 align:start position:0%
may come from any Source state grants
 
00:37:26.270 --> 00:37:26.280 align:start position:0%
federal grants um um local taxpayers
 
00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
that may may have arrived at the school
 
00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
district because of the funding formula
 
00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
and a and specific students you know the
 
00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:39.720 align:start position:0%
me members of the admr um do we track
 
00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
that down to that level so that we know
 
00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
that those specific dollars uh would be
 
00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
spent on those specific students thank
 
00:37:49.829 --> 00:37:49.839 align:start position:0%
you for the question I think I think I
 
00:37:50.910 --> 00:37:50.920 align:start position:0%
understand what you're asking
 
00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:53.480 align:start position:0%
differentiated a is not associated with
 
00:37:55.870 --> 00:37:55.880 align:start position:0%
a specific pupil identifier or anything
 
00:37:57.790 --> 00:37:57.800 align:start position:0%
like that it is based off of numbers in
 
00:37:59.670 --> 00:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
your District under the assumption that
 
00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
certain districts who have certain
 
00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:03.240 align:start position:0%
numbers of students who are eligible for
 
00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:05.880 align:start position:0%
certain supports and need more resources
 
00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:07.720 align:start position:0%
as a whole and the in the community it's
 
00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
not a pupil specific dollar amount that
 
00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:12.760 align:start position:0%
money is not assigned to that child so
 
00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
to speak it is part of the larger
 
00:38:17.349 --> 00:38:17.359 align:start position:0%
adequacy payment a quick follow up on
 
00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:21.200 align:start position:0%
that yes and thank thank you and and is
 
00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
it um um is it I guess your your
 
00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:29.480 align:start position:0%
impression um that that at least those
 
00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:33.240 align:start position:0%
at least those dollars that are that are
 
00:38:36.030 --> 00:38:36.040 align:start position:0%
that were you know that came through the
 
00:38:38.309 --> 00:38:38.319 align:start position:0%
adequacy funding formula as a result of
 
00:38:41.309 --> 00:38:41.319 align:start position:0%
special education differential Aid that
 
00:38:43.710 --> 00:38:43.720 align:start position:0%
districts are spending at least that
 
00:38:46.510 --> 00:38:46.520 align:start position:0%
amount of money on special education
 
00:38:48.349 --> 00:38:48.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I think that
 
00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
this committee has spoken extensively
 
00:38:52.589 --> 00:38:52.599 align:start position:0%
about the cost of special education as a
 
00:38:55.470 --> 00:38:55.480 align:start position:0%
whole and what it costs what the average
 
00:38:57.589 --> 00:38:57.599 align:start position:0%
cost is to educate a child with a
 
00:39:00.109 --> 00:39:00.119 align:start position:0%
disability what is the is far more than
 
00:39:02.069 --> 00:39:02.079 align:start position:0%
what the adequacy and the differentiated
 
00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:04.640 align:start position:0%
Aid payment is for those
 
00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:06.920 align:start position:0%
students thank you and just as a
 
00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:10.440 align:start position:0%
followup to all this the differentiated
 
00:39:13.069 --> 00:39:13.079 align:start position:0%
Aid monies within the adequacy formula
 
00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
are not targeted money
 
00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
non-targeted so it may say for special
 
00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
ed or elll or
 
00:39:28.309 --> 00:39:28.319 align:start position:0%
fnr no it's not targeted to one child
 
00:39:31.069 --> 00:39:31.079 align:start position:0%
it's targeted to the whole District to
 
00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
Ames uh isn't it true
 
00:39:46.069 --> 00:39:46.079 align:start position:0%
that uh special education
 
00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:49.720 align:start position:0%
services uh apart from those that
 
00:39:54.270 --> 00:39:54.280 align:start position:0%
involve actual separation of a child by
 
00:39:58.390 --> 00:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
necessity into a different environment
 
00:40:02.430 --> 00:40:02.440 align:start position:0%
are at the that the integration of
 
00:40:05.470 --> 00:40:05.480 align:start position:0%
special education into regular education
 
00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
is a core element of special education
 
00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:12.160 align:start position:0%
and has been ever since the Ida was
 
00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
enacted um back in whenever it was 70s
 
00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:21.720 align:start position:0%
um and uh and almost by
 
00:40:25.109 --> 00:40:25.119 align:start position:0%
definition if extra costs and there are
 
00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:26.920 align:start position:0%
extra costs to have an A in the
 
00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
um will
 
00:40:37.150 --> 00:40:37.160 align:start position:0%
necessarily involve other children who
 
00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
are not special education children along
 
00:40:43.109 --> 00:40:43.119 align:start position:0%
with children who do have
 
00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:48.720 align:start position:0%
IEPs um so that if the practice that
 
00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
we've heard about of not separating the
 
00:40:55.230 --> 00:40:55.240 align:start position:0%
money is entirely consistent with the
 
00:40:59.069 --> 00:40:59.079 align:start position:0%
purpose of the special education
 
00:41:01.829 --> 00:41:01.839 align:start position:0%
law thank you for the question special
 
00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:04.520 align:start position:0%
education Law requires that IEP teams
 
00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:06.160 align:start position:0%
Place students in the least restrictive
 
00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
environment that is appropriate to meet
 
00:41:09.349 --> 00:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
their needs and for the majority of
 
00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
students the least restrictive
 
00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:12.040 align:start position:0%
environment is the general education
 
00:41:15.069 --> 00:41:15.079 align:start position:0%
classroom so yes there's a lot of um
 
00:41:17.150 --> 00:41:17.160 align:start position:0%
attention and funding and planning that
 
00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
goes into trying to create a general
 
00:41:20.829 --> 00:41:20.839 align:start position:0%
education environment that is accessible
 
00:41:23.309 --> 00:41:23.319 align:start position:0%
for all students sometimes that requires
 
00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:24.800 align:start position:0%
Staffing sometimes that requires
 
00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:26.720 align:start position:0%
training sometimes that requires a
 
00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
certain type of specially designed
 
00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:30.800 align:start position:0%
instruction um all of those things again
 
00:41:33.349 --> 00:41:33.359 align:start position:0%
are not tied to an individual student
 
00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
per se even though you know there may be
 
00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
five six 10 students in a classroom who
 
00:41:39.550 --> 00:41:39.560 align:start position:0%
could benefit from that it's also
 
00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
benefiting a strong General Leed
 
00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
curriculum across the
 
00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
board thank you you're welcome are there
 
00:41:47.109 --> 00:41:47.119 align:start position:0%
any further questions we do have the
 
00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
department here too that might be able
 
00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
to give us the technical support
 
00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:51.910 align:start position:0%
to give us the technical support
represent

00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:54.160 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
being here to help
 
00:41:58.109 --> 00:41:58.119 align:start position:0%
us so would it be
 
00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
a concern if this legislation were to
 
00:42:04.069 --> 00:42:04.079 align:start position:0%
pass that we might not be in compliance
 
00:42:06.870 --> 00:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
with federal law if we in order to
 
00:42:09.829 --> 00:42:09.839 align:start position:0%
comply with this separation of special
 
00:42:09.839 --> 00:42:11.230 align:start position:0%
comply with this separation of special
education

00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:11.240 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
funding would that decrease inclusion
 
00:42:16.069 --> 00:42:16.079 align:start position:0%
and mean that students would not be in
 
00:42:18.270 --> 00:42:18.280 align:start position:0%
their least restrictive
 
00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
environment thank you for the question
 
00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
it's I think that's hard for me to give
 
00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
a clear yes or no answer however I will
 
00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:28.640 align:start position:0%
say that if T money become student
 
00:42:30.829 --> 00:42:30.839 align:start position:0%
specific a that would be a privacy
 
00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
concern I think to some extent
 
00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:33.960 align:start position:0%
especially in a smaller District where
 
00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:36.880 align:start position:0%
perhaps there are not um a large number
 
00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
of students who would be accessing These
 
00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
funds in the same way that you might
 
00:42:41.470 --> 00:42:41.480 align:start position:0%
have in a larger District I'm not sure
 
00:42:44.589 --> 00:42:44.599 align:start position:0%
how you would protect a students um
 
00:42:46.109 --> 00:42:46.119 align:start position:0%
privacy in terms of whether or not they
 
00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:49.160 align:start position:0%
are eligible for special education um in
 
00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
addition I
 
00:42:54.109 --> 00:42:54.119 align:start position:0%
think it would be very difficult for a
 
00:42:57.430 --> 00:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
school district to
 
00:43:00.270 --> 00:43:00.280 align:start position:0%
parse out a you know Staffing things
 
00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
like that if it's a very student
 
00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:04.440 align:start position:0%
specific money I mean at what point do
 
00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:06.160 align:start position:0%
you say to that staff member okay your
 
00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
time is up uh based on this funding for
 
00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:10.720 align:start position:0%
the day like move on to something else
 
00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
and that money is going to come out of
 
00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
some other aspect of a District's
 
00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
operating budget I'm not sure how that
 
00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:18.640 align:start position:0%
would be accounted for I think or to
 
00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
meet the spirit of I what I believe this
 
00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
bill is trying to do which is to ensure
 
00:43:26.069 --> 00:43:26.079 align:start position:0%
that students are getting services that
 
00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:27.720 align:start position:0%
they require those services are going to
 
00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
be required regardless of where the
 
00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
funding is coming
 
00:43:34.109 --> 00:43:34.119 align:start position:0%
from thank you very much and when we get
 
00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:37.800 align:start position:0%
down into the specifics on idea and what
 
00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
it can be used for we're gonna I'm going
 
00:43:41.230 --> 00:43:41.240 align:start position:0%
to those questions I'm going to parcel
 
00:43:43.069 --> 00:43:43.079 align:start position:0%
over to Melissa white if Melissa if
 
00:43:46.109 --> 00:43:46.119 align:start position:0%
you're able to come up
 
00:43:50.990 --> 00:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
after Becky here but is you pardon
 
00:43:55.829 --> 00:43:55.839 align:start position:0%
me for for Miss Wilson yes go ahead so
 
00:44:01.710 --> 00:44:01.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
thank you so this is about the first
 
00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
section only which is the special
 
00:44:10.549 --> 00:44:10.559 align:start position:0%
education Aid which previously was known
 
00:44:13.870 --> 00:44:13.880 align:start position:0%
as catastrophic Aid and I'm thinking
 
00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:17.200 align:start position:0%
that we don't need this paragraph at all
 
00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:20.240 align:start position:0%
because that's a program that
 
00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:22.520 align:start position:0%
reimburses expenditures that were
 
00:44:25.549 --> 00:44:25.559 align:start position:0%
previously made which were only made for
 
00:44:28.829 --> 00:44:28.839 align:start position:0%
special education students stents and
 
00:44:32.069 --> 00:44:32.079 align:start position:0%
and for a student to qualify for this
 
00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:34.200 align:start position:0%
their cost has to be three and a half
 
00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:36.520 align:start position:0%
times the state average cost which is
 
00:44:39.390 --> 00:44:39.400 align:start position:0%
thousands and thousands of dollars so we
 
00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
would not need this paragraph at all
 
00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
would you agree with that thank you for
 
00:44:46.109 --> 00:44:46.119 align:start position:0%
the question I would agree that students
 
00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:47.680 align:start position:0%
who are not eligible for special
 
00:44:49.589 --> 00:44:49.599 align:start position:0%
education would never be included in the
 
00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:51.640 align:start position:0%
special ed Aid or the catastrophic Aid
 
00:44:53.630 --> 00:44:53.640 align:start position:0%
category for
 
00:44:55.630 --> 00:44:55.640 align:start position:0%
reimbursement thank
 
00:44:58.190 --> 00:44:58.200 align:start position:0%
you yes
 
00:44:59.549 --> 00:44:59.559 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:45:01.829 --> 00:45:01.839 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'd like to go back
 
00:45:04.349 --> 00:45:04.359 align:start position:0%
to the um previous question not this
 
00:45:05.589 --> 00:45:05.599 align:start position:0%
last one that you answered the one
 
00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:09.640 align:start position:0%
before that where you commented that um
 
00:45:11.069 --> 00:45:11.079 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure I understood where we
 
00:45:13.109 --> 00:45:13.119 align:start position:0%
were going so I apologize you commented
 
00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
that we wouldn't want a teacher to stop
 
00:45:16.670 --> 00:45:16.680 align:start position:0%
teaching because they've run out of
 
00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:20.240 align:start position:0%
money um or something to that effect
 
00:45:23.069 --> 00:45:23.079 align:start position:0%
right is that really the case the way
 
00:45:24.430 --> 00:45:24.440 align:start position:0%
I'm understanding this bill is that the
 
00:45:26.270 --> 00:45:26.280 align:start position:0%
special education funds would not be for
 
00:45:28.309 --> 00:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
students not receiving special education
 
00:45:31.069 --> 00:45:31.079 align:start position:0%
services so where would that instance
 
00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:33.160 align:start position:0%
fall where somebody would have to stop
 
00:45:34.589 --> 00:45:34.599 align:start position:0%
their instruction because they've run
 
00:45:36.670 --> 00:45:36.680 align:start position:0%
out of money uh based off of what you
 
00:45:38.230 --> 00:45:38.240 align:start position:0%
were trying to explain to
 
00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
us thank you for the question there are
 
00:45:45.829 --> 00:45:45.839 align:start position:0%
there are situations where um again this
 
00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
money is not parsed out when it comes to
 
00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
the school district in this manner and
 
00:45:53.109 --> 00:45:53.119 align:start position:0%
being a student specific pot of money um
 
00:45:55.950 --> 00:45:55.960 align:start position:0%
so there are staff that are used perhaps
 
00:45:57.670 --> 00:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
in the regular ed class classroom to
 
00:45:59.630 --> 00:45:59.640 align:start position:0%
teach not only special education
 
00:46:01.349 --> 00:46:01.359 align:start position:0%
students but perhaps a small group of
 
00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:03.640 align:start position:0%
students of which some of those students
 
00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
are eligible for special education and
 
00:46:06.829 --> 00:46:06.839 align:start position:0%
are receiving their specially designed
 
00:46:08.710 --> 00:46:08.720 align:start position:0%
instruction within that group there may
 
00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
also be other regular Ed peers in that
 
00:46:12.670 --> 00:46:12.680 align:start position:0%
group because that is the least
 
00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:14.720 align:start position:0%
restrictive environment for that for
 
00:46:16.030 --> 00:46:16.040 align:start position:0%
that student who is getting those
 
00:46:18.309 --> 00:46:18.319 align:start position:0%
Services I think it would be very
 
00:46:18.319 --> 00:46:19.349 align:start position:0%
Services I think it would be very
difficult

00:46:19.349 --> 00:46:19.359 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
00:46:22.030 --> 00:46:22.040 align:start position:0%
to adhere to the spirit of what I
 
00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
believe this bill is trying to do which
 
00:46:26.910 --> 00:46:26.920 align:start position:0%
is at what point do you say that those
 
00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
funds for that staff member are being
 
00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:31.240 align:start position:0%
used for students outside of special
 
00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
education if you're not only solely
 
00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
teaching special education students
 
00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
which would be very restrictive for most
 
00:46:39.589 --> 00:46:39.599 align:start position:0%
students to pull them out of a situation
 
00:46:41.710 --> 00:46:41.720 align:start position:0%
where there are regular Ed peers and put
 
00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:44.440 align:start position:0%
them in a group with just other eligible
 
00:46:46.309 --> 00:46:46.319 align:start position:0%
special education students is fairly
 
00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
restrictive you're
 
00:46:51.309 --> 00:46:51.319 align:start position:0%
welcome just go
 
00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you Mr chair so for the
 
00:46:57.470 --> 00:46:57.480 align:start position:0%
second section we're talking about
 
00:47:01.589 --> 00:47:01.599 align:start position:0%
adequacy Aid and the reimbursement under
 
00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:04.280 align:start position:0%
current adequacy aid for a student that
 
00:47:08.829 --> 00:47:08.839 align:start position:0%
has an IEP is 2 TH or close to this I'm
 
00:47:11.589 --> 00:47:11.599 align:start position:0%
reading it out of this book
 
00:47:15.549 --> 00:47:15.559 align:start position:0%
$2,100 per student do you have any sense
 
00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:18.640 align:start position:0%
of how much it costs just to develop an
 
00:47:21.790 --> 00:47:21.800 align:start position:0%
IEP for a student and then that also has
 
00:47:25.470 --> 00:47:25.480 align:start position:0%
to be renewed every year correct so just
 
00:47:27.829 --> 00:47:27.839 align:start position:0%
in term staff time and think it adds up
 
00:47:30.309 --> 00:47:30.319 align:start position:0%
to quite a bit
 
00:47:34.589 --> 00:47:34.599 align:start position:0%
so that wasn't that question know I
 
00:47:38.589 --> 00:47:38.599 align:start position:0%
would agree I most Staffing for an IEP
 
00:47:41.349 --> 00:47:41.359 align:start position:0%
team meeting which is a required meeting
 
00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
has at least four to five staff members
 
00:47:47.549 --> 00:47:47.559 align:start position:0%
at a given time most special education
 
00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
staff because of some of the other
 
00:47:51.150 --> 00:47:51.160 align:start position:0%
special education aspects like Medicade
 
00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
and things like that you do figure out
 
00:47:54.630 --> 00:47:54.640 align:start position:0%
everyone's hourly rate I can tell you
 
00:47:58.430 --> 00:47:58.440 align:start position:0%
that the $2,100 would be rather
 
00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:01.470 align:start position:0%
that the $2,100 would be rather
quickly

00:48:01.470 --> 00:48:01.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:04.430 --> 00:48:04.440 align:start position:0%
2180 okay yes
 
00:48:06.589 --> 00:48:06.599 align:start position:0%
projected yes a quick one then I would
 
00:48:08.349 --> 00:48:08.359 align:start position:0%
like to get to the department because
 
00:48:10.349 --> 00:48:10.359 align:start position:0%
they're going to have the answers that
 
00:48:10.359 --> 00:48:11.549 align:start position:0%
they're going to have the answers that
we

00:48:11.549 --> 00:48:11.559 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:48:15.150 --> 00:48:15.160 align:start position:0%
need yes I from the
 
00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
director she talked about coordinating
 
00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:20.720 align:start position:0%
early interven Services what if you to
 
00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
talk about that and is that in essence
 
00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:26.960 align:start position:0%
applying the entire
 
00:48:29.589 --> 00:48:29.599 align:start position:0%
Provisions specialed to every single kid
 
00:48:32.549 --> 00:48:32.559 align:start position:0%

00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
you for the question um early
 
00:48:36.990 --> 00:48:37.000 align:start position:0%
intervention services and early supports
 
00:48:39.790 --> 00:48:39.800 align:start position:0%

00:48:55.710 --> 00:48:55.720 align:start position:0%
a community agency saying that they need
 
00:48:57.549 --> 00:48:57.559 align:start position:0%
extra support and service
 
00:49:00.309 --> 00:49:00.319 align:start position:0%
those students um the community agencies
 
00:49:01.710 --> 00:49:01.720 align:start position:0%
have to tell the school district when
 
00:49:03.589 --> 00:49:03.599 align:start position:0%
that child turns 2 and a half that they
 
00:49:06.270 --> 00:49:06.280 align:start position:0%
are coming up to age three and the
 
00:49:07.950 --> 00:49:07.960 align:start position:0%
district has a responsibility to
 
00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
evaluate them based on School District
 
00:49:11.710 --> 00:49:11.720 align:start position:0%
criteria about whether or not they would
 
00:49:15.990 --> 00:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:18.309 --> 00:49:18.319 align:start position:0%
intervention thank you very
 
00:49:21.069 --> 00:49:21.079 align:start position:0%

Melissa white come up and Melissa we do
 
00:49:30.990 --> 00:49:31.000 align:start position:0%
have some questions maybe you could
 
00:49:33.150 --> 00:49:33.160 align:start position:0%
start out with
 
00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
u getting into the issue of
 
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
idea and the federal law with those
 
00:49:41.510 --> 00:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
monies are coming down to us have some
 
00:49:45.950 --> 00:49:45.960 align:start position:0%
permissions by federal code or it's
 
00:49:49.549 --> 00:49:49.559 align:start position:0%
maybe it's law I don't know uh that that
 
00:49:51.430 --> 00:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
monies can be
 
00:49:54.910 --> 00:49:54.920 align:start position:0%
used after school or for other programs
 
00:49:57.829 --> 00:49:57.839 align:start position:0%
where there may not be special educ
 
00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:00.640 align:start position:0%
maybe remedial children there uh are you
 
00:50:02.950 --> 00:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
familiar with where I'm going um so MOA
 
00:50:04.190 --> 00:50:04.200 align:start position:0%
white division director for learner
 
00:50:05.710 --> 00:50:05.720 align:start position:0%

00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
of Education so just to be clear special
 
00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:11.430 align:start position:0%
of Education so just to be clear special
education

00:50:11.430 --> 00:50:11.440 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:50:14.870 --> 00:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
Aid those funds have to be spent on a
 
00:50:18.309 --> 00:50:18.319 align:start position:0%
student that has an IEP we receive the
 
00:50:21.470 --> 00:50:21.480 align:start position:0%
actual invoices for services we look at
 
00:50:24.910 --> 00:50:24.920 align:start position:0%
those invoices go into our Nessa system
 
00:50:27.309 --> 00:50:27.319 align:start position:0%
which looks at the students IEP and we
 
00:50:29.390 --> 00:50:29.400 align:start position:0%
were able to see this service that
 
00:50:31.789 --> 00:50:31.799 align:start position:0%
they're requesting funds for is in the
 
00:50:34.789 --> 00:50:34.799 align:start position:0%
students IEP so special education Aid
 
00:50:36.670 --> 00:50:36.680 align:start position:0%
those funds are not being spent on
 
00:50:39.390 --> 00:50:39.400 align:start position:0%
anything but what's in the formula
 
00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
specified in law for that student
 
00:50:43.950 --> 00:50:43.960 align:start position:0%
special education needs so there's you
 
00:50:45.870 --> 00:50:45.880 align:start position:0%
know this section in here regarding
 
00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:48.160 align:start position:0%
special education Aid it's not happening
 
00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
it can't happen it's very clear
 
00:50:55.309 --> 00:50:55.319 align:start position:0%
already with the idea funds the federal
 
00:50:58.390 --> 00:50:58.400 align:start position:0%
law does allow out for certain
 
00:51:03.069 --> 00:51:03.079 align:start position:0%
percentages to be used for what could be
 
00:51:05.789 --> 00:51:05.799 align:start position:0%
considered um not remediation but more
 
00:51:08.589 --> 00:51:08.599 align:start position:0%
like mitigation and and uh kind of a
 
00:51:11.349 --> 00:51:11.359 align:start position:0%
tier one or all student services
 
00:51:15.549 --> 00:51:15.559 align:start position:0%
however we're pretty stringent upon if
 
00:51:17.230 --> 00:51:17.240 align:start position:0%
you're going to use your funds for that
 
00:51:19.630 --> 00:51:19.640 align:start position:0%
type of an activity and the FEDS are
 
00:51:21.789 --> 00:51:21.799 align:start position:0%
also very stringent on if funds are
 
00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:23.160 align:start position:0%
going to be used for that type of
 
00:51:25.549 --> 00:51:25.559 align:start position:0%
activity you have to do a lot of data
 
00:51:27.870 --> 00:51:27.880 align:start position:0%
collection you have to do your needs
 
00:51:30.430 --> 00:51:30.440 align:start position:0%
assessment you have to do um kind of a
 
00:51:32.549 --> 00:51:32.559 align:start position:0%
baseline collection of data to look at
 
00:51:34.990 --> 00:51:35.000 align:start position:0%
okay here all the students and here
 
00:51:36.990 --> 00:51:37.000 align:start position:0%
where their skills are now now that
 
00:51:38.589 --> 00:51:38.599 align:start position:0%
we've instituted this program that
 
00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:40.640 align:start position:0%
serves all the students this is how it
 
00:51:44.349 --> 00:51:44.359 align:start position:0%
has helped us to reduce maybe um special
 
00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
education identification or redo
 
00:51:50.430 --> 00:51:50.440 align:start position:0%
something so it requires so
 
00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
much um analysis and work schools rarely
 
00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
tend to use it for something like that
 
00:51:58.829 --> 00:51:58.839 align:start position:0%
because their special education costs
 
00:52:02.990 --> 00:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
and needs are already um pretty clear
 
00:52:04.910 --> 00:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
that they're using those just directly
 
00:52:06.789 --> 00:52:06.799 align:start position:0%
for serving those special education
 
00:52:09.190 --> 00:52:09.200 align:start position:0%
students so so there it's in there but I
 
00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:11.200 align:start position:0%
will tell you that I I mean going down
 
00:52:14.069 --> 00:52:14.079 align:start position:0%
that route rarely is it happening um
 
00:52:16.829 --> 00:52:16.839 align:start position:0%
because when a school submits to us how
 
00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
they want to use their idea funds and if
 
00:52:20.829 --> 00:52:20.839 align:start position:0%
they're saying oh okay we want to do it
 
00:52:22.309 --> 00:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
for an after school program we're going
 
00:52:24.349 --> 00:52:24.359 align:start position:0%
to be very very strict about okay you
 
00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
need to provide us data on every single
 
00:52:28.150 --> 00:52:28.160 align:start position:0%
one of those students students how this
 
00:52:32.309 --> 00:52:32.319 align:start position:0%
program is supposed to help um special
 
00:52:35.470 --> 00:52:35.480 align:start position:0%
education students specifically and they
 
00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
tend to not do that because they have
 
00:52:38.710 --> 00:52:38.720 align:start position:0%
other federal funds they could use for
 
00:52:41.630 --> 00:52:41.640 align:start position:0%
an after school program so just to to
 
00:52:44.270 --> 00:52:44.280 align:start position:0%
follow up on that I'm not talking about
 
00:52:47.390 --> 00:52:47.400 align:start position:0%
the whole program but for mitigation
 
00:52:51.309 --> 00:52:51.319 align:start position:0%
factors regarding some children I as an
 
00:52:53.789 --> 00:52:53.799 align:start position:0%
administrator there are a lot of Hoops
 
00:52:57.390 --> 00:52:57.400 align:start position:0%
but federal law says you can do this
 
00:52:59.789 --> 00:52:59.799 align:start position:0%
uh so by this legislation right here
 
00:53:02.190 --> 00:53:02.200 align:start position:0%
that would take that little tool out of
 
00:53:05.309 --> 00:53:05.319 align:start position:0%
the bag that we couldn't do this I don't
 
00:53:07.030 --> 00:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
think so because it says that it's
 
00:53:09.549 --> 00:53:09.559 align:start position:0%
specific to special education state aid
 
00:53:11.910 --> 00:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
and it's specific
 
00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:14.640 align:start position:0%
to Grants distributed to M
 
00:53:16.309 --> 00:53:16.319 align:start position:0%
municipalities calculated persuant to
 
00:53:22.309 --> 00:53:22.319 align:start position:0%
RSA 1984a to uh Roman numeral 2D so that
 
00:53:24.430 --> 00:53:24.440 align:start position:0%
is not related to
 
00:53:27.710 --> 00:53:27.720 align:start position:0%
idea that's adequacy
 
00:53:28.910 --> 00:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
that's State
 
00:53:32.349 --> 00:53:32.359 align:start position:0%
funds that's my understanding okay are
 
00:53:34.510 --> 00:53:34.520 align:start position:0%
there any other questions for the
 
00:53:36.950 --> 00:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
Department on this right now yes
 
00:53:39.309 --> 00:53:39.319 align:start position:0%
represent McGuire uh thank you Mr
 
00:53:40.670 --> 00:53:40.680 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:53:44.829 --> 00:53:44.839 align:start position:0%
question so more big picture my
 
00:53:46.630 --> 00:53:46.640 align:start position:0%
understanding is total cost of special
 
00:53:50.829 --> 00:53:50.839 align:start position:0%
ed Statewide is 900 million plus per
 
00:53:54.670 --> 00:53:54.680 align:start position:0%
year and um the amount of money that
 
00:53:57.030 --> 00:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
would be under this restriction is way
 
00:53:59.870 --> 00:53:59.880 align:start position:0%
way less than that right so the chance
 
00:54:04.109 --> 00:54:04.119 align:start position:0%
that that um in some particular
 
00:54:06.630 --> 00:54:06.640 align:start position:0%
School uh they're getting more of this
 
00:54:10.349 --> 00:54:10.359 align:start position:0%
money and and spending less than that on
 
00:54:14.030 --> 00:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
on on special ed is is either can't
 
00:54:16.630 --> 00:54:16.640 align:start position:0%
happen or is extremely unlikely is that
 
00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
correct it's extremely unlikely all
 
00:54:22.309 --> 00:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:26.069 --> 00:54:26.079 align:start position:0%
you uh well while we are here then uh in
 
00:54:28.349 --> 00:54:28.359 align:start position:0%
term terms of the special education
 
00:54:34.069 --> 00:54:34.079 align:start position:0%
Aid previously catastrophic Aid um
 
00:54:37.829 --> 00:54:37.839 align:start position:0%
the there is a separate pot of money for
 
00:54:40.789 --> 00:54:40.799 align:start position:0%
that we've just heard the $34 million
 
00:54:43.630 --> 00:54:43.640 align:start position:0%
which we appropriate and we've spent or
 
00:54:46.390 --> 00:54:46.400 align:start position:0%
we have requests for approximately 51 of
 
00:54:49.109 --> 00:54:49.119 align:start position:0%
that so we have $17 million
 
00:54:53.470 --> 00:54:53.480 align:start position:0%
shortfall that money and the
 
00:54:58.270 --> 00:54:58.280 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid money the 20 1880 per
 
00:54:58.280 --> 00:54:59.829 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid money the 20 1880 per
pupil

00:54:59.829 --> 00:54:59.839 align:start position:0%
pupil
 
00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:04.960 align:start position:0%
um is catastrophic aid used for any of
 
00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
those students that may
 
00:55:09.630 --> 00:55:09.640 align:start position:0%
also be in a
 
00:55:13.829 --> 00:55:13.839 align:start position:0%
classroom for less than 20% of the time
 
00:55:16.470 --> 00:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
but enrolled in the school or is the
 
00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
school using catastrophic aid for
 
00:55:21.390 --> 00:55:21.400 align:start position:0%
reimbursement of that program you see
 
00:55:24.230 --> 00:55:24.240 align:start position:0%
where I'm coming from I think I
 
00:55:26.430 --> 00:55:26.440 align:start position:0%
understand special education Aid can can
 
00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
be used for a variety of services it can
 
00:55:31.630 --> 00:55:31.640 align:start position:0%
range from maybe Transportation needs it
 
00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
could be for out of District placement
 
00:55:35.870 --> 00:55:35.880 align:start position:0%
needs it could be for specialist needs
 
00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
so it's going to vary what the most
 
00:55:41.109 --> 00:55:41.119 align:start position:0%
important part is is that it's in the
 
00:55:44.430 --> 00:55:44.440 align:start position:0%
students IEP so we don't necessarily
 
00:55:46.589 --> 00:55:46.599 align:start position:0%
look at percentage of the student the
 
00:55:47.990 --> 00:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
time is spending in the classroom or
 
00:55:49.510 --> 00:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
specifying it that because it doesn't
 
00:55:52.309 --> 00:55:52.319 align:start position:0%
get into that spe level of specificity
 
00:55:55.109 --> 00:55:55.119 align:start position:0%
in the admin rules or in the RSA what we
 
00:55:57.950 --> 00:55:57.960 align:start position:0%
look at is is it in the students I AP
 
00:55:59.829 --> 00:55:59.839 align:start position:0%
collectively the cost the district has
 
00:56:01.870 --> 00:56:01.880 align:start position:0%
we look at the formula and then that's
 
00:56:03.069 --> 00:56:03.079 align:start position:0%
how we make our
 
00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
determination there is this concept or
 
00:56:08.870 --> 00:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
understanding that cat special education
 
00:56:12.390 --> 00:56:12.400 align:start position:0%
Aid is used for residential placements
 
00:56:15.910 --> 00:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
for transportation associate as well
 
00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:17.430 align:start position:0%
for transportation associate as well
homebound

00:56:17.430 --> 00:56:17.440 align:start position:0%
homebound
 
00:56:21.670 --> 00:56:21.680 align:start position:0%
504 or possibly a
 
00:56:24.349 --> 00:56:24.359 align:start position:0%
hospitalization uh so are we using
 
00:56:26.270 --> 00:56:26.280 align:start position:0%
catastrophic Aid to support student
 
00:56:29.349 --> 00:56:29.359 align:start position:0%
students which are in the classrooms are
 
00:56:33.950 --> 00:56:33.960 align:start position:0%
are are schools collecting that money uh
 
00:56:36.230 --> 00:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
to of course they have to spend over
 
00:56:38.270 --> 00:56:38.280 align:start position:0%
$70,000 before they get anything in
 
00:56:41.270 --> 00:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
anyways it's a wide range of services
 
00:56:44.670 --> 00:56:44.680 align:start position:0%
but it has to be in the students IEP so
 
00:56:47.230 --> 00:56:47.240 align:start position:0%
whether it's for a specific student that
 
00:56:49.670 --> 00:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
may have an out of District placement if
 
00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
it's for a student that hasn't it's
 
00:56:53.829 --> 00:56:53.839 align:start position:0%
there in the classroom but needs
 
00:56:55.789 --> 00:56:55.799 align:start position:0%
additional Services it's as long as it's
 
00:56:56.990 --> 00:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
in the student
 
00:57:00.750 --> 00:57:00.760 align:start position:0%
IEP that's what we look at the costs if
 
00:57:03.029 --> 00:57:03.039 align:start position:0%
they were um putting them for some sort
 
00:57:04.990 --> 00:57:05.000 align:start position:0%
of cost that would not be allowable we
 
00:57:06.510 --> 00:57:06.520 align:start position:0%
would just you know and we do get that
 
00:57:08.710 --> 00:57:08.720 align:start position:0%
we do get here's our submission of costs
 
00:57:10.390 --> 00:57:10.400 align:start position:0%
we would like you to reimburse us for
 
00:57:11.710 --> 00:57:11.720 align:start position:0%
and then we go through every single one
 
00:57:12.950 --> 00:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
of them and then say okay these are the
 
00:57:15.190 --> 00:57:15.200 align:start position:0%
ones that are actually allowable and I
 
00:57:16.910 --> 00:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
guess at least to my what I'm trying to
 
00:57:19.430 --> 00:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
find out do you when you're looking at
 
00:57:22.270 --> 00:57:22.280 align:start position:0%
these requests for funds say no you
 
00:57:24.510 --> 00:57:24.520 align:start position:0%
can't touch this pool of money which is
 
00:57:28.150 --> 00:57:28.160 align:start position:0%
catastrophic Aid ESP education unless
 
00:57:31.430 --> 00:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
the child is homebound
 
00:57:35.510 --> 00:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
504 maybe not 504 but hospitalization
 
00:57:38.470 --> 00:57:38.480 align:start position:0%
residential no because that's not listed
 
00:57:41.270 --> 00:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
in the RSA or in the administrative
 
00:57:43.870 --> 00:57:43.880 align:start position:0%
rules so it's all costs associated with
 
00:57:45.630 --> 00:57:45.640 align:start position:0%
special education Aid it could include
 
00:57:47.349 --> 00:57:47.359 align:start position:0%
those but it can include other costs as
 
00:57:49.150 --> 00:57:49.160 align:start position:0%
well we don't say it's just for these
 
00:57:50.710 --> 00:57:50.720 align:start position:0%
specific type of students or this type
 
00:57:52.190 --> 00:57:52.200 align:start position:0%
of student that has this specific
 
00:57:55.029 --> 00:57:55.039 align:start position:0%
disability we do not do that okay thank
 
00:57:57.750 --> 00:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
you that gets
 
00:58:00.789 --> 00:58:00.799 align:start position:0%
further questions of the
 
00:58:03.910 --> 00:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
department well thank you very much are
 
00:58:05.750 --> 00:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
there any other pink cards for this
 
00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:09.109 align:start position:0%
there any other pink cards for this
particular

00:58:09.109 --> 00:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:11.910 --> 00:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
bill then we will close the
 
00:58:17.109 --> 00:58:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:17.119 --> 00:58:18.750 align:start position:0%
 
237

00:58:18.750 --> 00:58:18.760 align:start position:0%
237
 
00:58:21.349 --> 00:58:21.359 align:start position:0%
is 10:30 and we're going to have to roll
 
00:58:31.750 --> 00:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:35.150 --> 00:58:35.160 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I I believe that clock is
 
00:58:38.349 --> 00:58:38.359 align:start position:0%
fast it's actually 10:27 so I don't want
 
00:58:40.349 --> 00:58:40.359 align:start position:0%
to push us into an issue where we get in
 
00:58:42.230 --> 00:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
trouble no well we have different time
 
00:58:44.309 --> 00:58:44.319 align:start position:0%
zones in this building you understand
 
00:58:46.029 --> 00:58:46.039 align:start position:0%
understand you go into the office in
 
00:58:47.950 --> 00:58:47.960 align:start position:0%
there and the clock is different you go
 
00:58:49.870 --> 00:58:49.880 align:start position:0%
in there it's different you go next door
 
00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:50.750 align:start position:0%
in there it's different you go next door
it's

00:58:50.750 --> 00:58:50.760 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:58:53.990 --> 00:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
different so so we have the fudge rule
 
00:58:56.150 --> 00:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
around here if it's pointed in the sort
 
00:58:57.990 --> 00:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
the right
 
00:59:02.710 --> 00:59:02.720 align:start position:0%
direction South then we go for
 
00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:04.470 align:start position:0%
direction South then we go for
it

00:59:04.470 --> 00:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:59:09.390 --> 00:59:09.400 align:start position:0%
yeah but at any rate um I'm going to Dan
 
00:59:11.589 --> 00:59:11.599 align:start position:0%
yeah I gotta introduce this would you
 
00:59:11.599 --> 00:59:19.670 align:start position:0%
yeah I gotta introduce this would you
chair

00:59:19.670 --> 00:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:23.710 --> 00:59:23.720 align:start position:0%
it let me get my garbage out the way
 
00:59:37.470 --> 00:59:37.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:37.480 --> 00:59:42.230 align:start position:0%
 
354

00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:44.470 --> 00:59:44.480 align:start position:0%
yeah oh they're not up there it was
 
00:59:48.470 --> 00:59:48.480 align:start position:0%
originally in that policy oh so
 
00:59:59.190 --> 00:59:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:01.109 --> 01:00:01.119 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to we're does who's
 
01:00:03.589 --> 01:00:03.599 align:start position:0%
missing these P the the bill itself
 
01:00:03.599 --> 01:00:05.230 align:start position:0%
missing these P the the bill itself
right

01:00:05.230 --> 01:00:05.240 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:00:08.829 --> 01:00:08.839 align:start position:0%
now so we'll we'll hold off a second or
 
01:00:11.710 --> 01:00:11.720 align:start position:0%
two until we can get that let me explain
 
01:00:16.109 --> 01:00:16.119 align:start position:0%
to you What 354 is um 354 is a bill that
 
01:00:18.270 --> 01:00:18.280 align:start position:0%
looks at Pathways for in Career
 
01:00:20.510 --> 01:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
Technical education to obtain
 
01:00:23.069 --> 01:00:23.079 align:start position:0%
alternative certification different
 
01:00:27.710 --> 01:00:27.720 align:start position:0%
Pathways and um if was it's referred to
 
01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:29.430 align:start position:0%
Pathways and um if was it's referred to
this

01:00:29.430 --> 01:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:00:31.750 --> 01:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
committee because it's a Career
 
01:00:35.029 --> 01:00:35.039 align:start position:0%
Technical education bill there's we'll
 
01:00:36.630 --> 01:00:36.640 align:start position:0%
get some bills in that do not have
 
01:00:39.910 --> 01:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
Financial notes on them uh that're not a
 
01:00:43.589 --> 01:00:43.599 align:start position:0%
funding issue but if they G get into two
 
01:00:46.390 --> 01:00:46.400 align:start position:0%
different categories higher education or
 
01:00:48.630 --> 01:00:48.640 align:start position:0%
Career Technical education they come to
 
01:00:50.029 --> 01:00:50.039 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
01:00:52.870 --> 01:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
automatically um it's just we Define
 
01:00:54.910 --> 01:00:54.920 align:start position:0%
that area policy where that area of
 
01:00:56.430 --> 01:00:56.440 align:start position:0%
policy is
 
01:00:58.470 --> 01:00:58.480 align:start position:0%
in the hands of this committee and then
 
01:01:00.309 --> 01:01:00.319 align:start position:0%
anything that has to do with funding
 
01:01:03.270 --> 01:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
issues that usually gets about $10,000
 
01:01:06.109 --> 01:01:06.119 align:start position:0%
per fiscal note they'll come there as
 
01:01:08.430 --> 01:01:08.440 align:start position:0%
well so that's the way how they when
 
01:01:10.109 --> 01:01:10.119 align:start position:0%
they're saying you go here or you go
 
01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
here with the bills this is how they're
 
01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:12.309 align:start position:0%
here with the bills this is how they're
doing

01:01:12.309 --> 01:01:12.319 align:start position:0%
doing
 
01:01:15.230 --> 01:01:15.240 align:start position:0%
it so we'll wait a few more seconds I'll
 
01:01:17.789 --> 01:01:17.799 align:start position:0%
go get myself planted and this a copy of
 
01:01:30.650 --> 01:01:30.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:30.660 --> 01:01:42.190 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:01:42.190 --> 01:01:42.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:52.990 --> 01:01:53.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
glasses go ahead start okay so the time
 
01:02:00.150 --> 01:02:00.160 align:start position:0%
being 10:30 we will um open the public
 
01:02:03.309 --> 01:02:03.319 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 354 and recognize
 
01:02:08.390 --> 01:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:10.750 --> 01:02:10.760 align:start position:0%
lad thank you very much representative
 
01:02:13.390 --> 01:02:13.400 align:start position:0%
McGuire and members of the committee uh
 
01:02:15.710 --> 01:02:15.720 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Rick lad I
 
01:02:17.870 --> 01:02:17.880 align:start position:0%
come from hail New Hampshire and I'm
 
01:02:21.109 --> 01:02:21.119 align:start position:0%
here today to introduce 354 which is a
 
01:02:24.510 --> 01:02:24.520 align:start position:0%
bill that uh relative to the alternative
 
01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:26.240 align:start position:0%
certification Pathways for Career and
 
01:02:29.789 --> 01:02:29.799 align:start position:0%
Technical education instructors um also
 
01:02:32.109 --> 01:02:32.119 align:start position:0%
sitting behind me we have the director
 
01:02:33.630 --> 01:02:33.640 align:start position:0%
of this program from Department of
 
01:02:36.829 --> 01:02:36.839 align:start position:0%
Education and then we have folks that
 
01:02:38.950 --> 01:02:38.960 align:start position:0%
are on The Advisory Group here or have
 
01:02:41.470 --> 01:02:41.480 align:start position:0%
been on The Advisory Group and and uh
 
01:02:44.349 --> 01:02:44.359 align:start position:0%
prior directors of director of the
 
01:02:48.430 --> 01:02:48.440 align:start position:0%
conquered CTE Center um I would like to
 
01:02:51.510 --> 01:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
go ahead and start this what this bill
 
01:02:57.029 --> 01:02:57.039 align:start position:0%
does we have in rule right now in 50
 
01:02:59.269 --> 01:02:59.279 align:start position:0%
5.01 parentheses
 
01:03:03.430 --> 01:03:03.440 align:start position:0%
G um language which is very similar to
 
01:03:06.069 --> 01:03:06.079 align:start position:0%
what you're seeing here very very
 
01:03:09.230 --> 01:03:09.240 align:start position:0%
similar the only difference is now what
 
01:03:11.789 --> 01:03:11.799 align:start position:0%
this program does it provides an
 
01:03:15.230 --> 01:03:15.240 align:start position:0%
alternative route for those that are
 
01:03:17.510 --> 01:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
going to be instructors at the Career
 
01:03:20.910 --> 01:03:20.920 align:start position:0%
Technical education centers in specific
 
01:03:25.829 --> 01:03:25.839 align:start position:0%
trades content areas to seek this path
 
01:03:27.390 --> 01:03:27.400 align:start position:0%
where you don't have to go through the
 
01:03:29.870 --> 01:03:29.880 align:start position:0%
same path that if you're going to be for
 
01:03:32.789 --> 01:03:32.799 align:start position:0%
example a teacher in a riger classroom
 
01:03:34.990 --> 01:03:35.000 align:start position:0%
or Elementary or middle school classroom
 
01:03:36.750 --> 01:03:36.760 align:start position:0%
or high school
 
01:03:39.230 --> 01:03:39.240 align:start position:0%
classroom and it allows us to
 
01:03:43.109 --> 01:03:43.119 align:start position:0%
incorporate the in the training and the
 
01:03:45.269 --> 01:03:45.279 align:start position:0%
knowledge and the skills that have been
 
01:03:49.829 --> 01:03:49.839 align:start position:0%
acquired through working in the field in
 
01:03:52.230 --> 01:03:52.240 align:start position:0%
their specific area they come with
 
01:03:54.589 --> 01:03:54.599 align:start position:0%
credentials that have maybe been offered
 
01:03:56.549 --> 01:03:56.559 align:start position:0%
by Ford Motor Company
 
01:03:59.750 --> 01:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
or as a mechanic or uh credentials that
 
01:04:03.230 --> 01:04:03.240 align:start position:0%
come in from uh working in a lab
 
01:04:05.230 --> 01:04:05.240 align:start position:0%
robotics area and they've been working
 
01:04:06.670 --> 01:04:06.680 align:start position:0%
there so they can come in and start
 
01:04:09.910 --> 01:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
teaching this or if they're coming in as
 
01:04:12.670 --> 01:04:12.680 align:start position:0%
an experienced welder and they have that
 
01:04:14.630 --> 01:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
from the American Association for
 
01:04:17.710 --> 01:04:17.720 align:start position:0%
welders so what we're trying to do is
 
01:04:21.470 --> 01:04:21.480 align:start position:0%
because there is a very uh I would say a
 
01:04:24.309 --> 01:04:24.319 align:start position:0%
large shortage of the skilled people
 
01:04:27.390 --> 01:04:27.400 align:start position:0%
necessary for our trade in for the CTE
 
01:04:30.190 --> 01:04:30.200 align:start position:0%
centers and we're in competition with
 
01:04:32.269 --> 01:04:32.279 align:start position:0%
you know folks so we're there's also a
 
01:04:35.069 --> 01:04:35.079 align:start position:0%
pool of retired people out there that
 
01:04:37.510 --> 01:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
have all this background information
 
01:04:39.390 --> 01:04:39.400 align:start position:0%
that we can tap
 
01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
into um so um there's a lot of
 
01:04:44.910 --> 01:04:44.920 align:start position:0%
experiences we've encountered our
 
01:04:46.510 --> 01:04:46.520 align:start position:0%
information that's been provided to us
 
01:04:49.190 --> 01:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
on the uh advisory Council for his
 
01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:50.480 align:start position:0%
career technical
 
01:04:54.430 --> 01:04:54.440 align:start position:0%
education and I can recall one down at a
 
01:04:56.029 --> 01:04:56.039 align:start position:0%
school on the southern part of state I'm
 
01:04:57.670 --> 01:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
not going to mention which one but they
 
01:04:59.549 --> 01:04:59.559 align:start position:0%
had a person already to come on board
 
01:05:02.230 --> 01:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
just before school started in the it
 
01:05:04.789 --> 01:05:04.799 align:start position:0%
area and that person was all of a sudden
 
01:05:06.829 --> 01:05:06.839 align:start position:0%
offered a job out in the midwest which
 
01:05:09.349 --> 01:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
almost tripled his salary and so he
 
01:05:11.029 --> 01:05:11.039 align:start position:0%
didn't so we had a hard time finding
 
01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
somebody to come in and fulfill this job
 
01:05:14.470 --> 01:05:14.480 align:start position:0%
because we had certain Hoops we had to
 
01:05:16.870 --> 01:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
jump through but there were people that
 
01:05:19.309 --> 01:05:19.319 align:start position:0%
were had the adequate knowledge and
 
01:05:22.950 --> 01:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
Concepts to do the job so with that I'm
 
01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
going to get in a little bit here on
 
01:05:28.029 --> 01:05:28.039 align:start position:0%
specifically what the differences are
 
01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
between the bills because there's only
 
01:05:32.829 --> 01:05:32.839 align:start position:0%
in only a couple words which are
 
01:05:35.190 --> 01:05:35.200 align:start position:0%
difference between this bill and what we
 
01:05:37.470 --> 01:05:37.480 align:start position:0%
have that's in rule right now that's
 
01:05:42.430 --> 01:05:42.440 align:start position:0%
been provided approved by jel car
 
01:05:47.430 --> 01:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
um the jel car approved rule
 
01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:49.269 align:start position:0%
um the jel car approved rule
505.01

01:05:49.269 --> 01:05:49.279 align:start position:0%
505.01
 
01:05:53.109 --> 01:05:53.119 align:start position:0%
saying a fulltime if you have full-time
 
01:05:55.390 --> 01:05:55.400 align:start position:0%
experience you and be working up the
 
01:05:59.069 --> 01:05:59.079 align:start position:0%
full whole time 40 hours a week or more
 
01:06:01.870 --> 01:06:01.880 align:start position:0%
then that's one of the qualifiers that
 
01:06:03.870 --> 01:06:03.880 align:start position:0%
you could come in on this alternative
 
01:06:06.750 --> 01:06:06.760 align:start position:0%
pathway the alternative pathway requires
 
01:06:08.349 --> 01:06:08.359 align:start position:0%
three years of professional paid
 
01:06:10.870 --> 01:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
full-time experience in the area for
 
01:06:13.950 --> 01:06:13.960 align:start position:0%
which the license is sought a current
 
01:06:16.269 --> 01:06:16.279 align:start position:0%
industry recognized credential approved
 
01:06:18.630 --> 01:06:18.640 align:start position:0%
by the department in a published list of
 
01:06:20.549 --> 01:06:20.559 align:start position:0%
acceptable credentials there's two areas
 
01:06:24.630 --> 01:06:24.640 align:start position:0%
right there so the the rule currently
 
01:06:28.589 --> 01:06:28.599 align:start position:0%
says 3 years of full-time experience
 
01:06:32.670 --> 01:06:32.680 align:start position:0%
this bill right here changes that to 3
 
01:06:37.630 --> 01:06:37.640 align:start position:0%
years of professional paid full-time
 
01:06:41.109 --> 01:06:41.119 align:start position:0%
experience and that's an that's an those
 
01:06:44.109 --> 01:06:44.119 align:start position:0%
extra two words
 
01:06:46.750 --> 01:06:46.760 align:start position:0%
um professional
 
01:06:51.470 --> 01:06:51.480 align:start position:0%
paid if you look at RSA
 
01:06:56.109 --> 01:06:56.119 align:start position:0%
193 excuse not 193 uh 21 and9 I'm used
 
01:06:58.670 --> 01:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
to saying 193 for just about everything
 
01:07:00.269 --> 01:07:00.279 align:start position:0%
uh 21
 
01:07:02.750 --> 01:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
and9 and get down underneath the rulle
 
01:07:04.750 --> 01:07:04.760 align:start position:0%
making authority of the State Board of
 
01:07:07.029 --> 01:07:07.039 align:start position:0%
Education they have rule making
 
01:07:09.309 --> 01:07:09.319 align:start position:0%
Authority for the
 
01:07:11.789 --> 01:07:11.799 align:start position:0%
qualifications of employees that are
 
01:07:13.230 --> 01:07:13.240 align:start position:0%
working in the classroom of course they
 
01:07:15.430 --> 01:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
do but it reads qualifications and
 
01:07:17.510 --> 01:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
duties of school administrative unit
 
01:07:20.670 --> 01:07:20.680 align:start position:0%
professional employees SAU professional
 
01:07:23.750 --> 01:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
employees they say professional
 
01:07:26.269 --> 01:07:26.279 align:start position:0%
employees going on
 
01:07:28.269 --> 01:07:28.279 align:start position:0%
it says professional preparation
 
01:07:30.309 --> 01:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
standards and approval of professional
 
01:07:32.670 --> 01:07:32.680 align:start position:0%
preparation programs for educators
 
01:07:34.470 --> 01:07:34.480 align:start position:0%
teaching and postsecondary institutions
 
01:07:37.510 --> 01:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
as authorized by the RSA the word
 
01:07:39.870 --> 01:07:39.880 align:start position:0%
professional is very very important and
 
01:07:42.150 --> 01:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
I'm going to give you a couple examples
 
01:07:43.910 --> 01:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
that I was trying to think how would I
 
01:07:46.269 --> 01:07:46.279 align:start position:0%
go about saying this last
 
01:07:50.029 --> 01:07:50.039 align:start position:0%
night and I'm going to just read several
 
01:07:51.870 --> 01:07:51.880 align:start position:0%
examples might for your consideration
 
01:07:53.069 --> 01:07:53.079 align:start position:0%
that might help you understand what
 
01:07:55.670 --> 01:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
we're trying to drive for here the first
 
01:07:58.750 --> 01:07:58.760 align:start position:0%
example full-time experience may be
 
01:08:01.630 --> 01:08:01.640 align:start position:0%
working full-time 40 hours a week at a
 
01:08:05.069 --> 01:08:05.079 align:start position:0%
gasoline station pumping gas or working
 
01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
full-time 40 hours per week washing cars
 
01:08:10.870 --> 01:08:10.880 align:start position:0%
at a car wash that's your
 
01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
experience now professional paid
 
01:08:15.670 --> 01:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
full-time experience may be working 40
 
01:08:19.189 --> 01:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
hours a week that's similar at a toota
 
01:08:22.149 --> 01:08:22.159 align:start position:0%
dealership as a Certified mechanic
 
01:08:24.630 --> 01:08:24.640 align:start position:0%
having completed a training program and
 
01:08:29.110 --> 01:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
possessing certification test done by
 
01:08:32.390 --> 01:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
toota Technical Training and education
 
01:08:34.870 --> 01:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
nwork they education Network and it's
 
01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:36.550 align:start position:0%
nwork they education Network and it's
parentheses

01:08:36.550 --> 01:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
parentheses
 
01:08:38.950 --> 01:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
t-teen they're coming in with that
 
01:08:41.189 --> 01:08:41.199 align:start position:0%
certification whereas the other person's
 
01:08:43.269 --> 01:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
doing that work you might be doing this
 
01:08:45.829 --> 01:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
work at home for yourself as your hobby
 
01:08:47.309 --> 01:08:47.319 align:start position:0%
and that is that going to be three years
 
01:08:50.470 --> 01:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
of experience no we want to elevate the
 
01:08:51.910 --> 01:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
standard for these people that are
 
01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
coming into CTE so it's a standard where
 
01:08:57.910 --> 01:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
we have have a list of approved
 
01:08:59.789 --> 01:08:59.799 align:start position:0%
certifications which were going to allow
 
01:09:03.349 --> 01:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
you to come in with three years prior
 
01:09:05.630 --> 01:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
experience and that's done through three
 
01:09:10.030 --> 01:09:10.040 align:start position:0%
years of Prior paid professional
 
01:09:12.829 --> 01:09:12.839 align:start position:0%
experience and so what this bill is
 
01:09:15.229 --> 01:09:15.239 align:start position:0%
trying to do is provide this alternative
 
01:09:17.030 --> 01:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
pathway so we can get these experienced
 
01:09:20.550 --> 01:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
people into our they may not have the
 
01:09:22.789 --> 01:09:22.799 align:start position:0%
certification or gone the certification
 
01:09:25.470 --> 01:09:25.480 align:start position:0%
route that for example I went through to
 
01:09:27.070 --> 01:09:27.080 align:start position:0%
get my certification to be a teacher in
 
01:09:29.189 --> 01:09:29.199 align:start position:0%
the classroom but they're coming in with
 
01:09:31.030 --> 01:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
all this other experience is that
 
01:09:33.870 --> 01:09:33.880 align:start position:0%
equivalent I would say in the in CTE
 
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
centers that's more than equivalent that
 
01:09:37.789 --> 01:09:37.799 align:start position:0%
even surpasses that's what I want to
 
01:09:40.910 --> 01:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
have I don't want to have PhD Mr Brown I
 
01:09:46.269 --> 01:09:46.279 align:start position:0%
want to have the Mr Brown that has the
 
01:09:49.550 --> 01:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
experience and the knowhow and how to
 
01:09:52.030 --> 01:09:52.040 align:start position:0%
turn that wrench or how to work in that
 
01:09:54.990 --> 01:09:55.000 align:start position:0%
kitchen and and so uh that's what we're
 
01:09:57.430 --> 01:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
doing it's just trying to tighten it up
 
01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
and put what we have in rule into
 
01:10:04.110 --> 01:10:04.120 align:start position:0%
statute but changing the rule slightly
 
01:10:07.350 --> 01:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
to say rather just full-time experience
 
01:10:10.229 --> 01:10:10.239 align:start position:0%
which we have in rule we want to make it
 
01:10:13.270 --> 01:10:13.280 align:start position:0%
with the professional paid
 
01:10:15.590 --> 01:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
fulltime and I will conclude with that
 
01:10:17.149 --> 01:10:17.159 align:start position:0%
because there's others here would
 
01:10:19.950 --> 01:10:19.960 align:start position:0%
probably want to speak on that um thank
 
01:10:22.070 --> 01:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
you but I I don't have any pink cards so
 
01:10:23.870 --> 01:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
if anyone else is going to want to speak
 
01:10:27.149 --> 01:10:27.159 align:start position:0%
on this please get us a pink card
 
01:10:29.310 --> 01:10:29.320 align:start position:0%
otherwise these this is your chance to
 
01:10:30.470 --> 01:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
ask questions I'll start with
 
01:10:32.470 --> 01:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
representative Mahan thank you
 
01:10:35.830 --> 01:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire um representative
 
01:10:40.149 --> 01:10:40.159 align:start position:0%
lad I just have one question is a a
 
01:10:42.430 --> 01:10:42.440 align:start position:0%
French a person who's fluent in French
 
01:10:45.630 --> 01:10:45.640 align:start position:0%
is he included in what you call career
 
01:10:47.270 --> 01:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
type of thing is is the French language
 
01:10:48.990 --> 01:10:49.000 align:start position:0%
because of the dir of language teachers
 
01:10:51.430 --> 01:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
in the schools is it possible that the a
 
01:10:53.709 --> 01:10:53.719 align:start position:0%
French speaking person can be included
 
01:10:55.590 --> 01:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
in this and let me let the second
 
01:10:57.990 --> 01:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
question then I'm done um say for
 
01:11:00.750 --> 01:11:00.760 align:start position:0%
instance you have one who graduated from
 
01:11:04.270 --> 01:11:04.280 align:start position:0%
the sorun system uh and he is absolutely
 
01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
fluent in French qualified by the French
 
01:11:08.550 --> 01:11:08.560 align:start position:0%
system and and certified there but he
 
01:11:09.910 --> 01:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
hasn't been paid because he was a
 
01:11:12.070 --> 01:11:12.080 align:start position:0%
student is there any way he can be
 
01:11:15.229 --> 01:11:15.239 align:start position:0%
included in this bill this is only for
 
01:11:18.310 --> 01:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
Career Technical Education Centers
 
01:11:19.910 --> 01:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
you're going to be teaching French at
 
01:11:21.830 --> 01:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
the high school now there's a prior High
 
01:11:24.149 --> 01:11:24.159 align:start position:0%
School teach uh vice principal sitting
 
01:11:26.870 --> 01:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
behind me from conquered high he may be
 
01:11:28.510 --> 01:11:28.520 align:start position:0%
able to answer how you know and he's
 
01:11:31.430 --> 01:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
been a director of the CTE program for a
 
01:11:33.310 --> 01:11:33.320 align:start position:0%
number of years now he's retired making
 
01:11:36.590 --> 01:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
some real bucks uh so but he may be able
 
01:11:38.229 --> 01:11:38.239 align:start position:0%
to answer that question for you but I
 
01:11:40.830 --> 01:11:40.840 align:start position:0%
would say no that that's not what the
 
01:11:43.110 --> 01:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
CTE Center is I don't believe there's
 
01:11:46.270 --> 01:11:46.280 align:start position:0%
any clusters or programs within the C
 
01:11:52.350 --> 01:11:52.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:56.550 --> 01:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
French thank you thank you um
 
01:12:00.910 --> 01:12:00.920 align:start position:0%
so I what I understand is that both A
 
01:12:03.070 --> 01:12:03.080 align:start position:0%
and B would be
 
01:12:06.070 --> 01:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
required yes so they need to be
 
01:12:08.910 --> 01:12:08.920 align:start position:0%
professional and they need the
 
01:12:14.270 --> 01:12:14.280 align:start position:0%
certificate um does that list of
 
01:12:17.270 --> 01:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
Industry recognized credentials that
 
01:12:20.390 --> 01:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
already exist is there some list
 
01:12:21.990 --> 01:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
somewhere the the director of the
 
01:12:23.510 --> 01:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
program is sitting here in the room as
 
01:12:27.030 --> 01:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
well so you know I don't have a list in
 
01:12:29.149 --> 01:12:29.159 align:start position:0%
front of me because I'm not over doe but
 
01:12:30.950 --> 01:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
yes there is you know if you were talk
 
01:12:33.149 --> 01:12:33.159 align:start position:0%
to Mr applebe too who is in charge
 
01:12:35.229 --> 01:12:35.239 align:start position:0%
licensure over there there are programs
 
01:12:36.669 --> 01:12:36.679 align:start position:0%
which they've looked at these type of
 
01:12:38.110 --> 01:12:38.120 align:start position:0%
credentials they are doing that
 
01:12:39.910 --> 01:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
currently I met with him this morning
 
01:12:42.470 --> 01:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
that was a question I did ask him and he
 
01:12:45.310 --> 01:12:45.320 align:start position:0%
says yes however we also have the
 
01:12:47.350 --> 01:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
director here well the reason I asked
 
01:12:48.990 --> 01:12:49.000 align:start position:0%
him because he left no Financial note
 
01:12:50.070 --> 01:12:50.080 align:start position:0%
and I
 
01:12:52.270 --> 01:12:52.280 align:start position:0%
thought to
 
01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:53.830 align:start position:0%
thought to
be

01:12:53.830 --> 01:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:12:56.070 --> 01:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
um there is no financially you're
 
01:12:57.310 --> 01:12:57.320 align:start position:0%
correct this is one of those policy
 
01:13:00.110 --> 01:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
issues that if if the list needed to be
 
01:13:01.590 --> 01:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
made then there would have been a
 
01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:03.550 align:start position:0%
made then there would have been a
financial

01:13:03.550 --> 01:13:03.560 align:start position:0%
financial
 
01:13:06.629 --> 01:13:06.639 align:start position:0%
right if that research had to
 
01:13:09.189 --> 01:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
happen that might be a question for doe
 
01:13:12.590 --> 01:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
because yeah yep yep other
 
01:13:15.950 --> 01:13:15.960 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative culc thank
 
01:13:19.990 --> 01:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
you very much Mr chair um in in
 
01:13:22.270 --> 01:13:22.280 align:start position:0%
reviewing this I love the idea um when
 
01:13:23.790 --> 01:13:23.800 align:start position:0%
you're talking about the 3 years of
 
01:13:26.189 --> 01:13:26.199 align:start position:0%
professional paid full fulltime
 
01:13:28.550 --> 01:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
experience should we also be thinking
 
01:13:31.470 --> 01:13:31.480 align:start position:0%
about adding in a licensed professional
 
01:13:33.750 --> 01:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
so if they are a welder they're a
 
01:13:36.350 --> 01:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
licensed welder um or are we getting
 
01:13:38.669 --> 01:13:38.679 align:start position:0%
away from having them carry their
 
01:13:42.910 --> 01:13:42.920 align:start position:0%
license on through this teaching
 
01:13:46.189 --> 01:13:46.199 align:start position:0%
program The lure in many of these uh
 
01:13:51.030 --> 01:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
areas are issued by various professional
 
01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:54.440 align:start position:0%
associations um and the certification uh
 
01:13:57.910 --> 01:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
so again I I think you're getting to I'm
 
01:13:59.950 --> 01:13:59.960 align:start position:0%
not a director I think you need be
 
01:14:01.510 --> 01:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
asking the people that are running this
 
01:14:04.229 --> 01:14:04.239 align:start position:0%
program that question behind me it's a
 
01:14:04.239 --> 01:14:05.149 align:start position:0%
program that question behind me it's a
good

01:14:05.149 --> 01:14:05.159 align:start position:0%
good
 
01:14:08.910 --> 01:14:08.920 align:start position:0%
question thank you all right let me ask
 
01:14:11.470 --> 01:14:11.480 align:start position:0%
a question I want to ask about a section
 
01:14:16.510 --> 01:14:16.520 align:start position:0%
B here uh certified credential so I was
 
01:14:19.110 --> 01:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
a u Computer Engineering professor and I
 
01:14:23.149 --> 01:14:23.159 align:start position:0%
got my job based on my degree but I
 
01:14:26.310 --> 01:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
don't know that in my field or in the
 
01:14:29.390 --> 01:14:29.400 align:start position:0%
general field of of software development
 
01:14:31.590 --> 01:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
there is such a
 
01:14:34.310 --> 01:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
credential available to someone you see
 
01:14:36.229 --> 01:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
what I mean I I'm not sure this applies
 
01:14:40.030 --> 01:14:40.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily to all Fields what do you
 
01:14:42.910 --> 01:14:42.920 align:start position:0%
think I would talk from a historical
 
01:14:44.830 --> 01:14:44.840 align:start position:0%
background when we were just coming out
 
01:14:48.350 --> 01:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
when we had the rudimentary
 
01:14:51.750 --> 01:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
computers uh desktop and Microsoft had
 
01:14:55.229 --> 01:14:55.239 align:start position:0%
some credentials which they issued
 
01:14:57.750 --> 01:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
however since then I I'm not aware and
 
01:14:59.950 --> 01:14:59.960 align:start position:0%
there probably is you know it's a field
 
01:15:01.390 --> 01:15:01.400 align:start position:0%
that's just
 
01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:03.030 align:start position:0%
that's just
mushroomed

01:15:03.030 --> 01:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
mushroomed
 
01:15:06.070 --> 01:15:06.080 align:start position:0%
uh I don't have a total answer on that
 
01:15:07.990 --> 01:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
one at one time I knew there were
 
01:15:10.750 --> 01:15:10.760 align:start position:0%
credentials issued by Microsoft and they
 
01:15:12.110 --> 01:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
had training and professional
 
01:15:15.070 --> 01:15:15.080 align:start position:0%
development for teachers for their
 
01:15:17.229 --> 01:15:17.239 align:start position:0%
specific product for their specific
 
01:15:20.030 --> 01:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
product yes their applications yes all
 
01:15:22.750 --> 01:15:22.760 align:start position:0%
right thank you other questions no all
 
01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
right well thank you very much
 
01:15:25.350 --> 01:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
representative and I do have another
 
01:15:26.669 --> 01:15:26.679 align:start position:0%
pink card
 
01:15:31.149 --> 01:15:31.159 align:start position:0%
now from Steve uh thanks Steve rberg I
 
01:15:34.229 --> 01:15:34.239 align:start position:0%
guess um he's representing his company
 
01:15:36.110 --> 01:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll clarify which we'll find out
 
01:15:38.430 --> 01:15:38.440 align:start position:0%
what that Rick Rick Rick spoke very well
 
01:15:40.950 --> 01:15:40.960 align:start position:0%
of me I was the CT principal in conquer
 
01:15:42.629 --> 01:15:42.639 align:start position:0%
for 14 years I retired a couple years
 
01:15:44.709 --> 01:15:44.719 align:start position:0%
ago um the other thing he said is I'm
 
01:15:46.189 --> 01:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
making tons of money that wasn't quite
 
01:15:48.669 --> 01:15:48.679 align:start position:0%
accurate but we we'll leave that aside
 
01:15:50.950 --> 01:15:50.960 align:start position:0%
um so presently I did start a company
 
01:15:52.750 --> 01:15:52.760 align:start position:0%
called Rothenberg consulant group very
 
01:15:55.830 --> 01:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
original name um and I service is the
 
01:15:57.149 --> 01:15:57.159 align:start position:0%
reason my relevance for this committee
 
01:15:59.629 --> 01:15:59.639 align:start position:0%
aside from my background is I have a
 
01:16:00.990 --> 01:16:01.000 align:start position:0%
contract with the State Career and
 
01:16:03.110 --> 01:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
Technical Association and I service
 
01:16:06.430 --> 01:16:06.440 align:start position:0%
about 95 to 100 teachers at any one time
 
01:16:08.550 --> 01:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
who would be affected by this bill so
 
01:16:10.310 --> 01:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
every any Career Technical teacher in
 
01:16:13.110 --> 01:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
the state with my contract they contact
 
01:16:15.189 --> 01:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
me at the earliest stage of interest and
 
01:16:16.910 --> 01:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
I bring them through a three-year plus
 
01:16:19.149 --> 01:16:19.159 align:start position:0%
process of getting certified so I'm on
 
01:16:20.709 --> 01:16:20.719 align:start position:0%
the front lines all the questions you've
 
01:16:22.550 --> 01:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
asked I'm on the front lines of those
 
01:16:24.430 --> 01:16:24.440 align:start position:0%
questions right now so I wonder if I can
 
01:16:25.709 --> 01:16:25.719 align:start position:0%
just address some of the questions and
 
01:16:27.310 --> 01:16:27.320 align:start position:0%
help Rick out a little bit the question
 
01:16:29.590 --> 01:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
about lure totally relevant but the
 
01:16:31.870 --> 01:16:31.880 align:start position:0%
common denominator is years in the field
 
01:16:34.510 --> 01:16:34.520 align:start position:0%
so uh a a plumber or a licensed plumber
 
01:16:36.189 --> 01:16:36.199 align:start position:0%
or a licensed cosmetologist or a
 
01:16:39.430 --> 01:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
licensed um um electrician would
 
01:16:41.149 --> 01:16:41.159 align:start position:0%
generally also have those three years in
 
01:16:43.310 --> 01:16:43.320 align:start position:0%
the field so there's very very few
 
01:16:44.790 --> 01:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
licensed professions that would affect
 
01:16:46.430 --> 01:16:46.440 align:start position:0%
Career and Technical education so that's
 
01:16:48.229 --> 01:16:48.239 align:start position:0%
probably why licensing wasn't there the
 
01:16:50.110 --> 01:16:50.120 align:start position:0%
key was it the the key is that they're
 
01:16:51.910 --> 01:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
authentic they've been in the field
 
01:16:53.229 --> 01:16:53.239 align:start position:0%
they've been working with people you
 
01:16:55.070 --> 01:16:55.080 align:start position:0%
know and using your example as a
 
01:16:58.950 --> 01:16:58.960 align:start position:0%
Professor um the the two things were
 
01:17:00.030 --> 01:17:00.040 align:start position:0%
said first I want to address the
 
01:17:01.870 --> 01:17:01.880 align:start position:0%
certification piece so if you entered
 
01:17:03.590 --> 01:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
care technical education and you became
 
01:17:05.709 --> 01:17:05.719 align:start position:0%
a you be you really would fall under a
 
01:17:08.350 --> 01:17:08.360 align:start position:0%
very large sort of area for
 
01:17:10.270 --> 01:17:10.280 align:start position:0%
qualification it's not like uh you're
 
01:17:13.470 --> 01:17:13.480 align:start position:0%
going to do uh just one thing so there
 
01:17:15.590 --> 01:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
are certifications and a wide spectrum
 
01:17:19.510 --> 01:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
of them in that space um that uh range
 
01:17:22.350 --> 01:17:22.360 align:start position:0%
from programming to network routers to a
 
01:17:25.430 --> 01:17:25.440 align:start position:0%
variety of things of that sort um the
 
01:17:26.950 --> 01:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
the scope of it there's a list in the
 
01:17:28.030 --> 01:17:28.040 align:start position:0%
state going back to your question
 
01:17:29.750 --> 01:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
earlier there's a list already
 
01:17:31.430 --> 01:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
pre-approved that was built in
 
01:17:33.950 --> 01:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
partnership with the uh Department of
 
01:17:36.750 --> 01:17:36.760 align:start position:0%
Education as well as the uh director's
 
01:17:39.430 --> 01:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
Association and the state has been
 
01:17:41.470 --> 01:17:41.480 align:start position:0%
exceptional in their open-mindedness to
 
01:17:43.270 --> 01:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
look at other ones that are not on the
 
01:17:45.669 --> 01:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
list you have people who come uh from
 
01:17:48.669 --> 01:17:48.679 align:start position:0%
HVAC careers and they have some Nuance
 
01:17:52.030 --> 01:17:52.040 align:start position:0%
training dealing with HVAC units that
 
01:17:53.430 --> 01:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
the state even though it's not the list
 
01:17:55.270 --> 01:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
they accept it is this common sense they
 
01:17:57.430 --> 01:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
they've demonstrated their expertise um
 
01:18:00.669 --> 01:18:00.679 align:start position:0%
as part of the mix um but there's a this
 
01:18:03.790 --> 01:18:03.800 align:start position:0%
is a major road getting in and I I do I
 
01:18:06.629 --> 01:18:06.639 align:start position:0%
do support the bill as mentioned uh just
 
01:18:09.110 --> 01:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
and really what in reality of way the
 
01:18:11.910 --> 01:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
Rick explained it that word professional
 
01:18:13.990 --> 01:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
um sort of has been the operating model
 
01:18:15.830 --> 01:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
so far this is some of this stuff is in
 
01:18:18.030 --> 01:18:18.040 align:start position:0%
rules with the with the Department of
 
01:18:19.830 --> 01:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
Education so everything sort of being
 
01:18:21.669 --> 01:18:21.679 align:start position:0%
talked about today is already happening
 
01:18:24.830 --> 01:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
this is not a new space a lot of this is
 
01:18:26.470 --> 01:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
is in place it's been mature it's been
 
01:18:28.310 --> 01:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
going for decades this is not just a
 
01:18:30.229 --> 01:18:30.239 align:start position:0%
couple of years but a long long time
 
01:18:32.750 --> 01:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
what's nice is to see it codified uh in
 
01:18:35.390 --> 01:18:35.400 align:start position:0%
statute um so that it becomes sort of
 
01:18:37.910 --> 01:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
part of where we are and who we are but
 
01:18:40.790 --> 01:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
uh it's a remarkably positive piece of
 
01:18:43.709 --> 01:18:43.719 align:start position:0%
the puzzle um it you have to I think the
 
01:18:44.990 --> 01:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
last thing this morning I was writing
 
01:18:46.830 --> 01:18:46.840 align:start position:0%
job descriptions for the new uh
 
01:18:48.830 --> 01:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
winnisquam Career and Technical Center
 
01:18:50.790 --> 01:18:50.800 align:start position:0%
and they've got to attract a machining
 
01:18:52.790 --> 01:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
person and a cosmetologist to come work
 
01:18:55.110 --> 01:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
there and I think the main my last
 
01:18:57.590 --> 01:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
message and I'll take any questions is
 
01:18:59.350 --> 01:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
you have to sort of understand the
 
01:19:01.590 --> 01:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
cultural shift to attract somebody to
 
01:19:03.950 --> 01:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
leave industry and become a high school
 
01:19:06.350 --> 01:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
teacher it's it's night and day might be
 
01:19:09.669 --> 01:19:09.679 align:start position:0%
a two week of an analogy um and so how
 
01:19:11.950 --> 01:19:11.960 align:start position:0%
do you sort of convince them and what we
 
01:19:14.030 --> 01:19:14.040 align:start position:0%
know is that um they're educated they
 
01:19:15.350 --> 01:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
have a ton of experience in the field
 
01:19:16.910 --> 01:19:16.920 align:start position:0%
they're going to bring a lot to students
 
01:19:18.590 --> 01:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
they need a ton of training you know to
 
01:19:20.870 --> 01:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
become Educators but the system has set
 
01:19:23.070 --> 01:19:23.080 align:start position:0%
up that um they demonstrate the fact
 
01:19:25.229 --> 01:19:25.239 align:start position:0%
they basic skills they demonstrate they
 
01:19:27.070 --> 01:19:27.080 align:start position:0%
have content knowledge they demonstrate
 
01:19:28.310 --> 01:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
the law enforcement that they're all
 
01:19:30.110 --> 01:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
cleared they have to go through a hiring
 
01:19:31.750 --> 01:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
process um and then they get in there
 
01:19:33.310 --> 01:19:33.320 align:start position:0%
and they need a ton of training but our
 
01:19:35.350 --> 01:19:35.360 align:start position:0%
job is get them in
 
01:19:37.950 --> 01:19:37.960 align:start position:0%
there all right yeah that's training ped
 
01:19:40.590 --> 01:19:40.600 align:start position:0%
pedagogical training yeah all right over
 
01:19:46.510 --> 01:19:46.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:51.510 --> 01:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:55.790 --> 01:19:55.800 align:start position:0%
um so uh the question I had was about
 
01:19:58.310 --> 01:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
actually about pedagogy so this is an
 
01:20:02.070 --> 01:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
alternative pathway so would it be like
 
01:20:04.229 --> 01:20:04.239 align:start position:0%
all three all four kind of yeah so if
 
01:20:05.590 --> 01:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
you go back to the old days you call it
 
01:20:08.390 --> 01:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
all four now it's called sblp site-based
 
01:20:11.390 --> 01:20:11.400 align:start position:0%
licensing plans okay and what that is if
 
01:20:12.990 --> 01:20:13.000 align:start position:0%
I just sort of give one paragraph
 
01:20:16.470 --> 01:20:16.480 align:start position:0%
overview um I I work with the new
 
01:20:19.270 --> 01:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
teacher uh the superintendent and the
 
01:20:22.430 --> 01:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
the CT director principal and we develop
 
01:20:26.229 --> 01:20:26.239 align:start position:0%
a three-year plan for them to two sets
 
01:20:28.750 --> 01:20:28.760 align:start position:0%
of Education two pieces one is what Rick
 
01:20:30.590 --> 01:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
said a second ago pedagogy which is
 
01:20:32.110 --> 01:20:32.120 align:start position:0%
generally curriculum instruction
 
01:20:34.790 --> 01:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
assessment and uh access special ed
 
01:20:36.830 --> 01:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
those four general areas um and then
 
01:20:38.310 --> 01:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
they have to develop and those are
 
01:20:40.189 --> 01:20:40.199 align:start position:0%
generally done through acquired
 
01:20:41.950 --> 01:20:41.960 align:start position:0%
coursework um and then they have to
 
01:20:43.750 --> 01:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
develop the knowledge the nuances of
 
01:20:45.229 --> 01:20:45.239 align:start position:0%
Career and Technical education which is
 
01:20:47.149 --> 01:20:47.159 align:start position:0%
done through mentoring coaching
 
01:20:49.950 --> 01:20:49.960 align:start position:0%
networking but not formal classes so
 
01:20:51.189 --> 01:20:51.199 align:start position:0%
they have a three-year window to
 
01:20:55.350 --> 01:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
complete that um and uh I I think what's
 
01:20:56.910 --> 01:20:56.920 align:start position:0%
important is the beauty of this model is
 
01:20:59.070 --> 01:20:59.080 align:start position:0%
they do start on day one they're not
 
01:21:00.510 --> 01:21:00.520 align:start position:0%
they're not they don't have to wait four
 
01:21:03.550 --> 01:21:03.560 align:start position:0%
years to get a degree but on day one and
 
01:21:05.590 --> 01:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
day week week one and month one and
 
01:21:07.830 --> 01:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
month two it's a lot as you can imagine
 
01:21:10.590 --> 01:21:10.600 align:start position:0%
so you're balancing pedagog learning the
 
01:21:12.590 --> 01:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
pedagogical techniques with managing a
 
01:21:14.470 --> 01:21:14.480 align:start position:0%
classroom which you know up till now
 
01:21:16.669 --> 01:21:16.679 align:start position:0%
they may have been in the in working in
 
01:21:18.590 --> 01:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
a hospital as a nurse they may have been
 
01:21:20.470 --> 01:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
auto technician maybe a graphic designer
 
01:21:22.149 --> 01:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
working at their computer all day and
 
01:21:23.310 --> 01:21:23.320 align:start position:0%
now you're working your computer all day
 
01:21:25.950 --> 01:21:25.960 align:start position:0%
with 25 students standing next to you
 
01:21:29.070 --> 01:21:29.080 align:start position:0%
okay a little different thanks yep see
 
01:21:31.830 --> 01:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
did I see a hand down the go ahead
 
01:21:35.110 --> 01:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
represent thank you Mr chair
 
01:21:38.470 --> 01:21:38.480 align:start position:0%
um this is a related question so you've
 
01:21:40.110 --> 01:21:40.120 align:start position:0%
partly answered it but could you tell us
 
01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:41.270 align:start position:0%
partly answered it but could you tell us
more

01:21:41.270 --> 01:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:21:45.709 --> 01:21:45.719 align:start position:0%
about that process of helping a trades
 
01:21:47.430 --> 01:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
person or whatever discipline they're
 
01:21:51.030 --> 01:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
skilled in also become a capable
 
01:21:54.550 --> 01:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
educator and do they end up with an
 
01:21:58.390 --> 01:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
education credential yeah so um the the
 
01:22:00.990 --> 01:22:01.000 align:start position:0%
structural answer is um you you get
 
01:22:01.910 --> 01:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
something called a statement of
 
01:22:03.910 --> 01:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
Eligibility which demonstrates your
 
01:22:06.669 --> 01:22:06.679 align:start position:0%
content knowledge basic skills knowledge
 
01:22:08.430 --> 01:22:08.440 align:start position:0%
and your criminal background check that
 
01:22:10.709 --> 01:22:10.719 align:start position:0%
makes you eligible to get hired you get
 
01:22:12.750 --> 01:22:12.760 align:start position:0%
hired in the first 60 days we build to
 
01:22:15.149 --> 01:22:15.159 align:start position:0%
plan and then you become an intern and
 
01:22:17.310 --> 01:22:17.320 align:start position:0%
that's a three-year window to be an
 
01:22:19.470 --> 01:22:19.480 align:start position:0%
intern and then you earn at the end of
 
01:22:20.430 --> 01:22:20.440 align:start position:0%
those three years something called a
 
01:22:23.270 --> 01:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
beginning educator certificate which is
 
01:22:25.950 --> 01:22:25.960 align:start position:0%
98% of a regular a teacher certificate
 
01:22:27.229 --> 01:22:27.239 align:start position:0%
and then there's three more years after
 
01:22:28.229 --> 01:22:28.239 align:start position:0%
that you get what's called an
 
01:22:29.750 --> 01:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
experienced educator and then you're
 
01:22:31.510 --> 01:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
like the full poor the only difference
 
01:22:33.149 --> 01:22:33.159 align:start position:0%
between experienced and a beginner is
 
01:22:34.830 --> 01:22:34.840 align:start position:0%
they can't Mentor somebody in that year
 
01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
four to
 
01:22:38.510 --> 01:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
six so so that's the that's the concrete
 
01:22:40.270 --> 01:22:40.280 align:start position:0%
part of it the I think you're asking
 
01:22:41.870 --> 01:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
also on the cultural side of it too I
 
01:22:44.910 --> 01:22:44.920 align:start position:0%
wasn't quite yeah so cultural side is
 
01:22:47.870 --> 01:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
very complex uh as you can imagine um so
 
01:22:49.270 --> 01:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
I'm going to I'm going to reference my
 
01:22:53.790 --> 01:22:53.800 align:start position:0%
time in conquered um we we I'm telling
 
01:22:55.910 --> 01:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
you this as an alory as a story less as
 
01:22:59.470 --> 01:22:59.480 align:start position:0%
an answer I saw the absolute need to
 
01:23:03.030 --> 01:23:03.040 align:start position:0%
have common structures in pedagogi in
 
01:23:05.590 --> 01:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
the whole Center so that whether you the
 
01:23:07.189 --> 01:23:07.199 align:start position:0%
cosmetology teacher the health science
 
01:23:10.070 --> 01:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
teacher the computer science teacher we
 
01:23:11.430 --> 01:23:11.440 align:start position:0%
need common structures around
 
01:23:13.550 --> 01:23:13.560 align:start position:0%
particularly assessment for example
 
01:23:15.070 --> 01:23:15.080 align:start position:0%
because if you don't have that common
 
01:23:17.669 --> 01:23:17.679 align:start position:0%
structure these folks take this job and
 
01:23:19.310 --> 01:23:19.320 align:start position:0%
their only favor referen is their own
 
01:23:21.550 --> 01:23:21.560 align:start position:0%
high school experience and then you're
 
01:23:22.629 --> 01:23:22.639 align:start position:0%
you're in trouble at that point you're
 
01:23:26.110 --> 01:23:26.120 align:start position:0%
in deep trouble um so these folks need
 
01:23:28.870 --> 01:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
Services uh locally in their school they
 
01:23:31.149 --> 01:23:31.159 align:start position:0%
need services from regular Ed teachers I
 
01:23:33.229 --> 01:23:33.239 align:start position:0%
I I I'm writing an article right now
 
01:23:35.590 --> 01:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
where we had a real master biology
 
01:23:38.669 --> 01:23:38.679 align:start position:0%
teacher uh at Conger high and I had her
 
01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
Mentor a new auto teacher who you know
 
01:23:42.990 --> 01:23:43.000 align:start position:0%
was brand new out but he was a bright
 
01:23:44.950 --> 01:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
guy and he always says to me that was
 
01:23:46.229 --> 01:23:46.239 align:start position:0%
the greatest thing that ever happened to
 
01:23:48.310 --> 01:23:48.320 align:start position:0%
me being mentored by that biology
 
01:23:49.629 --> 01:23:49.639 align:start position:0%
teacher who was you know practically a
 
01:23:53.430 --> 01:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
PhD and she said the same thing uh but
 
01:23:55.070 --> 01:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
it's really hard that's the that's the
 
01:23:56.709 --> 01:23:56.719 align:start position:0%
spirit of what I'm answering you on
 
01:23:58.189 --> 01:23:58.199 align:start position:0%
there's resources in the state there's
 
01:24:00.350 --> 01:24:00.360 align:start position:0%
resources locally there's resources in
 
01:24:01.590 --> 01:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
the professional association there's
 
01:24:04.229 --> 01:24:04.239 align:start position:0%
resources from Jeff uh from the from the
 
01:24:06.310 --> 01:24:06.320 align:start position:0%
from the Department of the state it
 
01:24:08.830 --> 01:24:08.840 align:start position:0%
needs more it needs more attention
 
01:24:10.189 --> 01:24:10.199 align:start position:0%
because it's it's it's a really really
 
01:24:11.910 --> 01:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
hard prompt but the beauty of it is is
 
01:24:13.550 --> 01:24:13.560 align:start position:0%
you get those folks in and they're
 
01:24:14.910 --> 01:24:14.920 align:start position:0%
teaching these classes as you can
 
01:24:17.430 --> 01:24:17.440 align:start position:0%
imagine students love it but they have
 
01:24:19.030 --> 01:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
to be able to maintain their ability to
 
01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:20.229 align:start position:0%
to be able to maintain their ability to
be

01:24:20.229 --> 01:24:20.239 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:24:25.709 --> 01:24:25.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:28.550 --> 01:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very helpful
 
01:24:31.229 --> 01:24:31.239 align:start position:0%
explanation could you inform us about
 
01:24:34.750 --> 01:24:34.760 align:start position:0%
the adequacy or lack thereof of people
 
01:24:38.350 --> 01:24:38.360 align:start position:0%
to be mentors and in in the context that
 
01:24:41.390 --> 01:24:41.400 align:start position:0%
you just described yeah um um and is
 
01:24:44.149 --> 01:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
there compensation for that additional
 
01:24:45.910 --> 01:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
work it's good that's a good question so
 
01:24:49.590 --> 01:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
first um the the state of New Hampshire
 
01:24:52.270 --> 01:24:52.280 align:start position:0%
uh and sponsored by the Bureau of Crea
 
01:24:55.830 --> 01:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
development um has a cluster model so
 
01:24:58.910 --> 01:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
when I become the new um Plumbing
 
01:25:01.070 --> 01:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
teacher or the new graphic design
 
01:25:04.310 --> 01:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
teacher um I join a group of my peers in
 
01:25:08.629 --> 01:25:08.639 align:start position:0%
the state via an online entity and so
 
01:25:10.990 --> 01:25:11.000 align:start position:0%
that's a very powerful mentoring model
 
01:25:12.669 --> 01:25:12.679 align:start position:0%
then there's local mentoring models that
 
01:25:15.229 --> 01:25:15.239 align:start position:0%
depend on the district to some degree uh
 
01:25:17.790 --> 01:25:17.800 align:start position:0%
for example when conquered uh part of
 
01:25:19.830 --> 01:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
the collective buying agreement mandated
 
01:25:21.430 --> 01:25:21.440 align:start position:0%
mentors you had to you know you you had
 
01:25:23.629 --> 01:25:23.639 align:start position:0%
to have a mentor uh and mentors come in
 
01:25:25.470 --> 01:25:25.480 align:start position:0%
two Frameworks one is I'm going to meor
 
01:25:26.990 --> 01:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
you how to enter grades in your grade
 
01:25:29.189 --> 01:25:29.199 align:start position:0%
book you know very sort of survival kind
 
01:25:31.629 --> 01:25:31.639 align:start position:0%
of stuff and then there's really true
 
01:25:33.510 --> 01:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
pedagogical mentoring that are going to
 
01:25:35.390 --> 01:25:35.400 align:start position:0%
bring you through how to how to do all
 
01:25:37.550 --> 01:25:37.560 align:start position:0%
those things and I think it's erratic I
 
01:25:38.750 --> 01:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
mean that's the best answer I can give
 
01:25:41.310 --> 01:25:41.320 align:start position:0%
you that's very local based um on a
 
01:25:44.470 --> 01:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
state level um that cluster piece is the
 
01:25:47.590 --> 01:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
answer um there's also a Statewide
 
01:25:49.390 --> 01:25:49.400 align:start position:0%
conference in August people get together
 
01:25:51.629 --> 01:25:51.639 align:start position:0%
but what we know is mentoring is
 
01:25:53.229 --> 01:25:53.239 align:start position:0%
essential but I think when you're
 
01:25:54.790 --> 01:25:54.800 align:start position:0%
nodding your head earlier
 
01:25:56.590 --> 01:25:56.600 align:start position:0%
when you're you don't have a luxury of
 
01:25:58.910 --> 01:25:58.920 align:start position:0%
being at UNH for 3 years starting to be
 
01:26:01.310 --> 01:26:01.320 align:start position:0%
a teacher uh September 1 all of a sudden
 
01:26:03.590 --> 01:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
you're in the thick and we've got to
 
01:26:05.229 --> 01:26:05.239 align:start position:0%
figure out ways to reach these folks and
 
01:26:07.270 --> 01:26:07.280 align:start position:0%
it's constantly
 
01:26:09.350 --> 01:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
evolving yeah I spend a lot of time in
 
01:26:10.750 --> 01:26:10.760 align:start position:0%
that space it's I think it's the most
 
01:26:12.310 --> 01:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
critical we can talk about everything we
 
01:26:14.470 --> 01:26:14.480 align:start position:0%
want in this room this is the most we
 
01:26:16.310 --> 01:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
we'll get them into the job but if we
 
01:26:18.070 --> 01:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
don't offer them tremendous amount of
 
01:26:20.830 --> 01:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
support and training um as evidenced by
 
01:26:22.550 --> 01:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
Rick's story of the money whatever
 
01:26:24.790 --> 01:26:24.800 align:start position:0%
Midwest money they'll leave you know uh
 
01:26:26.310 --> 01:26:26.320 align:start position:0%
and we got to find a way where they feel
 
01:26:31.590 --> 01:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:35.149 --> 01:26:35.159 align:start position:0%
fellow thank you um I have I have a
 
01:26:39.030 --> 01:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
concern about the requirement B that
 
01:26:41.629 --> 01:26:41.639 align:start position:0%
they need a current industry recognized
 
01:26:46.629 --> 01:26:46.639 align:start position:0%
credential for one of our most needed uh
 
01:26:48.510 --> 01:26:48.520 align:start position:0%
skill set and that's people who can work
 
01:26:51.510 --> 01:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
on building houses because I know that
 
01:26:54.870 --> 01:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
the carpentry Union has a a training
 
01:26:57.790 --> 01:26:57.800 align:start position:0%
program but I live up by Plymouth and
 
01:27:00.470 --> 01:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
I've never run into anybody that works
 
01:27:02.709 --> 01:27:02.719 align:start position:0%
on houses that has any kind of
 
01:27:05.669 --> 01:27:05.679 align:start position:0%
credential yeah so I I I feel like I can
 
01:27:07.750 --> 01:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
give you a good answer to that so you
 
01:27:10.590 --> 01:27:10.600 align:start position:0%
are correct that and when Rick was
 
01:27:12.550 --> 01:27:12.560 align:start position:0%
talking about the professional standard
 
01:27:13.750 --> 01:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
the first thing came to my mind was
 
01:27:15.669 --> 01:27:15.679 align:start position:0%
construction trades it's it's all over
 
01:27:17.669 --> 01:27:17.679 align:start position:0%
the place to some degree unless you're
 
01:27:19.510 --> 01:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
in a union unions are very structured in
 
01:27:21.270 --> 01:27:21.280 align:start position:0%
terms of what you get but there there's
 
01:27:22.910 --> 01:27:22.920 align:start position:0%
a very simple cocation that the state
 
01:27:24.470 --> 01:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
accepts and I think that's part of it is
 
01:27:27.470 --> 01:27:27.480 align:start position:0%
OSHA um and OSHA is applicable to
 
01:27:30.030 --> 01:27:30.040 align:start position:0%
everything you do in construction um and
 
01:27:33.270 --> 01:27:33.280 align:start position:0%
it's a very manageable one to get so
 
01:27:35.310 --> 01:27:35.320 align:start position:0%
let's just say you're a trades person
 
01:27:36.910 --> 01:27:36.920 align:start position:0%
you're a mason or electrician you've
 
01:27:38.870 --> 01:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
done 15 years in the field obviously if
 
01:27:40.390 --> 01:27:40.400 align:start position:0%
you're a master electrician or Master
 
01:27:42.669 --> 01:27:42.679 align:start position:0%
Plumber you have a c certificate but the
 
01:27:45.109 --> 01:27:45.119 align:start position:0%
better example be a Mason um or someone
 
01:27:47.470 --> 01:27:47.480 align:start position:0%
who does some specialty like flooring or
 
01:27:49.270 --> 01:27:49.280 align:start position:0%
whatever else or carpentry where there
 
01:27:52.189 --> 01:27:52.199 align:start position:0%
is no lure they would say okay I can
 
01:27:53.510 --> 01:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
demonstrate to you I've done 10 years in
 
01:27:55.590 --> 01:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
the field so they they they can show
 
01:27:57.390 --> 01:27:57.400 align:start position:0%
customers and then they get the oosha
 
01:27:58.870 --> 01:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
which is very manageable and then they
 
01:28:01.109 --> 01:28:01.119 align:start position:0%
can get hired so I think the system
 
01:28:03.229 --> 01:28:03.239 align:start position:0%
respects that we're not going to have
 
01:28:05.550 --> 01:28:05.560 align:start position:0%
you do a makeup one like a fake one I
 
01:28:08.030 --> 01:28:08.040 align:start position:0%
think that's a spirit of my
 
01:28:11.390 --> 01:28:11.400 align:start position:0%
response one followup then represent bur
 
01:28:14.109 --> 01:28:14.119 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking of like the the people who
 
01:28:16.669 --> 01:28:16.679 align:start position:0%
um do the framing of the house and that
 
01:28:18.669 --> 01:28:18.679 align:start position:0%
kind of thing do OA would definitely
 
01:28:21.790 --> 01:28:21.800 align:start position:0%
apply okay without a doubt OSHA is a Val
 
01:28:23.109 --> 01:28:23.119 align:start position:0%
M fact a lot of times you can't get a
 
01:28:24.550 --> 01:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
job in the field without your 10 hour
 
01:28:27.189 --> 01:28:27.199 align:start position:0%
oosha card like building codes yeah well
 
01:28:28.550 --> 01:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
building codes would be more extreme
 
01:28:30.709 --> 01:28:30.719 align:start position:0%
example but it may not be a you got to
 
01:28:32.070 --> 01:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
realiz like you've been in the field 15
 
01:28:33.270 --> 01:28:33.280 align:start position:0%
years you don't have a certificate you
 
01:28:35.350 --> 01:28:35.360 align:start position:0%
need to get you you you know that you
 
01:28:37.030 --> 01:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
know woodworking you know framing you
 
01:28:39.070 --> 01:28:39.080 align:start position:0%
know Ro we just need to get you a
 
01:28:40.990 --> 01:28:41.000 align:start position:0%
certificate and OSHA is generally a very
 
01:28:42.750 --> 01:28:42.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable one and most folks do it and
 
01:28:44.189 --> 01:28:44.199 align:start position:0%
they don't and they they they're they're
 
01:28:45.669 --> 01:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
fine with it it makes sense a lot of
 
01:28:46.990 --> 01:28:47.000 align:start position:0%
them have it already but if they don't
 
01:28:49.669 --> 01:28:49.679 align:start position:0%
get it it's very easy to get
 
01:28:49.679 --> 01:28:50.910 align:start position:0%
get it it's very easy to get
representative

01:28:50.910 --> 01:28:50.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:28:53.350 --> 01:28:53.360 align:start position:0%
Burton uh thank you Mr chairman and
 
01:28:56.390 --> 01:28:56.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for your taking my question I
 
01:28:58.590 --> 01:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
had the experience of running a
 
01:29:00.390 --> 01:29:00.400 align:start position:0%
community college a couple years ago
 
01:29:03.590 --> 01:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
with the traditional fashion and it was
 
01:29:05.430 --> 01:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
very hard to find instructors because
 
01:29:07.790 --> 01:29:07.800 align:start position:0%
they can make a lot more money working
 
01:29:10.990 --> 01:29:11.000 align:start position:0%
in their field and I I take it and I had
 
01:29:12.709 --> 01:29:12.719 align:start position:0%
diesel carpentry air conditioning
 
01:29:15.870 --> 01:29:15.880 align:start position:0%
electricians trying to find instructors
 
01:29:17.750 --> 01:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
is hard so I think one of the impetus
 
01:29:20.590 --> 01:29:20.600 align:start position:0%
for this bill is to broaden your ability
 
01:29:23.790 --> 01:29:23.800 align:start position:0%
to find people to to be instructors in
 
01:29:27.030 --> 01:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
these field is that is that true do you
 
01:29:29.990 --> 01:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
have a shortage of yeah without a doubt
 
01:29:33.350 --> 01:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
right now there's a shortage uh it of
 
01:29:35.149 --> 01:29:35.159 align:start position:0%
particularly trades people that's what
 
01:29:37.430 --> 01:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
we're referring to uh to leave their
 
01:29:39.950 --> 01:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
trades but what is unique is that there
 
01:29:43.030 --> 01:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
are people at a certain age who are sort
 
01:29:45.310 --> 01:29:45.320 align:start position:0%
of ready to leave the trades um their
 
01:29:47.709 --> 01:29:47.719 align:start position:0%
knees are saying uh the wallet the
 
01:29:49.950 --> 01:29:49.960 align:start position:0%
wallet likes the job but the knees do
 
01:29:52.669 --> 01:29:52.679 align:start position:0%
not like the job um and so you've got to
 
01:29:54.870 --> 01:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
sort of find people ready transition and
 
01:29:56.390 --> 01:29:56.400 align:start position:0%
then I think the spirit of your comment
 
01:29:58.750 --> 01:29:58.760 align:start position:0%
represent Burton is if they're ready to
 
01:30:00.470 --> 01:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
transition we've got to have a nice
 
01:30:02.229 --> 01:30:02.239 align:start position:0%
runway for them to do it that has that
 
01:30:04.750 --> 01:30:04.760 align:start position:0%
does is not filled with friction just a
 
01:30:04.760 --> 01:30:06.189 align:start position:0%
does is not filled with friction just a
quick

01:30:06.189 --> 01:30:06.199 align:start position:0%
quick
 
01:30:08.629 --> 01:30:08.639 align:start position:0%
follow I I was lucky because I was my
 
01:30:10.189 --> 01:30:10.199 align:start position:0%
Camp was right in the middle of
 
01:30:14.430 --> 01:30:14.440 align:start position:0%
darling's Volvo Ford everything my
 
01:30:15.950 --> 01:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
question is
 
01:30:18.950 --> 01:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
um do these vehic can work part-time too
 
01:30:21.910 --> 01:30:21.920 align:start position:0%
or these you have to get the credentials
 
01:30:21.920 --> 01:30:22.950 align:start position:0%
or these you have to get the credentials
on

01:30:22.950 --> 01:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:30:25.189 --> 01:30:25.199 align:start position:0%
people teaching part-time as well as
 
01:30:28.229 --> 01:30:28.239 align:start position:0%
full-time so could they have a job at a
 
01:30:31.149 --> 01:30:31.159 align:start position:0%
dealership and still be instructing in
 
01:30:33.950 --> 01:30:33.960 align:start position:0%
the auto program for example they could
 
01:30:36.629 --> 01:30:36.639 align:start position:0%
um it's hard but yes they could I I
 
01:30:38.550 --> 01:30:38.560 align:start position:0%
think what I want to mix up is the the
 
01:30:40.750 --> 01:30:40.760 align:start position:0%
DAT the language of the bill says you
 
01:30:43.189 --> 01:30:43.199 align:start position:0%
need have had full-time experience so
 
01:30:45.830 --> 01:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
that's before but once you enter the
 
01:30:48.390 --> 01:30:48.400 align:start position:0%
world could you do a hybrid yes it's
 
01:30:50.470 --> 01:30:50.480 align:start position:0%
extremely difficult and I think
 
01:30:53.149 --> 01:30:53.159 align:start position:0%
generally is not that productive because
 
01:30:54.510 --> 01:30:54.520 align:start position:0%
you teaching
 
01:30:55.990 --> 01:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
teaching is not 9
 
01:30:59.669 --> 01:30:59.679 align:start position:0%
to5 as you know thank you all right well
 
01:31:01.310 --> 01:31:01.320 align:start position:0%
we're out of time thank you very much
 
01:31:04.030 --> 01:31:04.040 align:start position:0%
Sor I spoke too long there no it's very
 
01:31:06.070 --> 01:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
useful and so I'll close the public
 
01:31:22.910 --> 01:31:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:59.669 --> 01:31:59.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:03.830 --> 01:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:07.229 --> 01:32:07.239 align:start position:0%
now okay we're on HP
 
01:32:10.510 --> 01:32:10.520 align:start position:0%

we're ready well thank you thank you Mr
 
01:32:49.149 --> 01:32:49.159 align:start position:0%
chairman uh good morning Mr chairman and
 
01:32:50.750 --> 01:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
01:32:52.830 --> 01:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
my name is Gary Daniels I'm the state
 
01:32:55.149 --> 01:32:55.159 align:start position:0%
representative from Hillsboro District
 
01:32:57.470 --> 01:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
43 representing the town of
 
01:33:02.669 --> 01:33:02.679 align:start position:0%
Milford uh under current law RSA 188
 
01:33:05.229 --> 01:33:05.239 align:start position:0%
e32 states that once a district has
 
01:33:07.709 --> 01:33:07.719 align:start position:0%
accepted funds for the from the state
 
01:33:10.310 --> 01:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of building space for a
 
01:33:12.910 --> 01:33:12.920 align:start position:0%
Career and Technical education class or
 
01:33:15.669 --> 01:33:15.679 align:start position:0%
CTE that space must be used by the
 
01:33:18.790 --> 01:33:18.800 align:start position:0%
Career and Technical education center
 
01:33:21.189 --> 01:33:21.199 align:start position:0%
exclusively the option of repurposing
 
01:33:23.870 --> 01:33:23.880 align:start position:0%
the space is I understand it would
 
01:33:25.750 --> 01:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
require that the school district buy
 
01:33:31.070 --> 01:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
back from the state uh the space uh that
 
01:33:33.990 --> 01:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
it that it the state had given it before
 
01:33:35.950 --> 01:33:35.960 align:start position:0%
through the funding uh while I
 
01:33:37.870 --> 01:33:37.880 align:start position:0%
understand the purpose of this policy in
 
01:33:40.270 --> 01:33:40.280 align:start position:0%
in the short term I believe that the
 
01:33:42.270 --> 01:33:42.280 align:start position:0%
policy could limit the opportunity for
 
01:33:44.950 --> 01:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
students in the long term if the
 
01:33:47.350 --> 01:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
district offered a CTE class in for
 
01:33:51.030 --> 01:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
instance microbiology or biotech in the
 
01:33:52.950 --> 01:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
interest of the students in this class
 
01:33:55.270 --> 01:33:55.280 align:start position:0%
expanded Beyond the capacity of the
 
01:33:57.830 --> 01:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
class any District wishing to build
 
01:34:00.750 --> 01:34:00.760 align:start position:0%
additional space and vacate the current
 
01:34:02.590 --> 01:34:02.600 align:start position:0%
space would need to reimburse the state
 
01:34:05.470 --> 01:34:05.480 align:start position:0%
for the cost of the state the co the
 
01:34:08.390 --> 01:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
cost of the space being vacated in other
 
01:34:11.550 --> 01:34:11.560 align:start position:0%
words if you had 10,000 square foot of
 
01:34:14.270 --> 01:34:14.280 align:start position:0%
classroom space for CTE and you wish to
 
01:34:16.790 --> 01:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
expand that class to 20,000 Square F
 
01:34:19.350 --> 01:34:19.360 align:start position:0%
feet to offer more opportunity for
 
01:34:22.669 --> 01:34:22.679 align:start position:0%
students the choices now seem to be to
 
01:34:25.390 --> 01:34:25.400 align:start position:0%
reimburse the state or to raise that is
 
01:34:28.790 --> 01:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
to tear down the classroom so that the
 
01:34:31.870 --> 01:34:31.880 align:start position:0%
larger classroom can be built in some
 
01:34:33.750 --> 01:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
cases this may result in tearing down
 
01:34:36.070 --> 01:34:36.080 align:start position:0%
the newest part of a school at an
 
01:34:39.189 --> 01:34:39.199 align:start position:0%
additional and unnecessary cost to the
 
01:34:39.199 --> 01:34:40.270 align:start position:0%
additional and unnecessary cost to the
school

01:34:40.270 --> 01:34:40.280 align:start position:0%

01:34:44.470 --> 01:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
district House Bill 484 simply adds this
 
01:34:49.030 --> 01:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
conditional language to RSA 188 E3 after
 
01:34:50.470 --> 01:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
the word

01:35:13.149 --> 01:35:13.159 align:start position:0%
Technical education program that
 
01:35:17.109 --> 01:35:17.119 align:start position:0%
occupies the space if the space being V
 
01:35:19.950 --> 01:35:19.960 align:start position:0%
vacated has been used for TW at least 20
 
01:35:22.310 --> 01:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
years and the expansion is being done to
 
01:35:25.149 --> 01:35:25.159 align:start position:0%
offer more opportunities students I feel
 
01:35:27.510 --> 01:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
that the state the school districts and
 
01:35:32.750 --> 01:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
the students all win the State wins by
 
01:35:35.950 --> 01:35:35.960 align:start position:0%
helping to create a a CTE class that
 
01:35:38.950 --> 01:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
over 20 years has shown to be successful
 
01:35:42.590 --> 01:35:42.600 align:start position:0%
and in it's growing the school district
 
01:35:45.390 --> 01:35:45.400 align:start position:0%
wins by saving money the taxpayers win
 
01:35:47.350 --> 01:35:47.360 align:start position:0%
by saving money because they don't have
 
01:35:50.229 --> 01:35:50.239 align:start position:0%
to tear down part of the building and
 
01:35:52.709 --> 01:35:52.719 align:start position:0%
they can save that expense in the
 
01:35:55.709 --> 01:35:55.719 align:start position:0%
expansion and the students win because
 
01:35:57.470 --> 01:35:57.480 align:start position:0%
the there's more
 
01:36:00.109 --> 01:36:00.119 align:start position:0%
opportunity uh for them in their
 
01:36:02.629 --> 01:36:02.639 align:start position:0%
learning uh I would before I close I
 
01:36:04.990 --> 01:36:05.000 align:start position:0%
would like to just give one one example
 
01:36:07.790 --> 01:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
and this is kind of what prompted uh
 
01:36:11.510 --> 01:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
this bill in Milford we had a CTE
 
01:36:14.030 --> 01:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
expansion of Warren article last
 
01:36:17.950 --> 01:36:17.960 align:start position:0%
year uh that Warren article failed and
 
01:36:20.350 --> 01:36:20.360 align:start position:0%
the school district did a survey
 
01:36:22.590 --> 01:36:22.600 align:start position:0%
subsequent to that to try to get an idea
 
01:36:24.470 --> 01:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
of why it failed
 
01:36:27.750 --> 01:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
the most common opposition to this came
 
01:36:30.950 --> 01:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
in it's too much money you need to kind
 
01:36:34.430 --> 01:36:34.440 align:start position:0%
cut the cost down uh second there were
 
01:36:37.910 --> 01:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
other things in there but why are we
 
01:36:39.550 --> 01:36:39.560 align:start position:0%
tearing down the newest part of the
 
01:36:42.590 --> 01:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
school so that we can expand it was in
 
01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:44.030 align:start position:0%
school so that we can expand it was in
there

01:36:44.030 --> 01:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:36:48.910 --> 01:36:48.920 align:start position:0%
so if we're able to repurpose this space
 
01:36:50.950 --> 01:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
I think it allows those that do the
 
01:36:54.430 --> 01:36:54.440 align:start position:0%
designing to uh say that money that it
 
01:36:56.910 --> 01:36:56.920 align:start position:0%
would cost to raise it and rebuild it in
 
01:36:59.470 --> 01:36:59.480 align:start position:0%
this in this case here I mean the we've
 
01:37:01.390 --> 01:37:01.400 align:start position:0%
got a current proposal that was coming
 
01:37:03.629 --> 01:37:03.639 align:start position:0%
in it has since Been Changed by the
 
01:37:05.470 --> 01:37:05.480 align:start position:0%
school board but they were in the
 
01:37:07.590 --> 01:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
expansion proposal for this year they
 
01:37:09.750 --> 01:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
were going to tear down two chemistry
 
01:37:14.709 --> 01:37:14.719 align:start position:0%
labs to rebuild them in in the new CTE
 
01:37:16.910 --> 01:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
expansion um I think there's a way that
 
01:37:19.910 --> 01:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
we can save money in in there and so
 
01:37:22.750 --> 01:37:22.760 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill uh hopes to do uh
 
01:37:25.550 --> 01:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
through legisl research it was DET uh I
 
01:37:27.510 --> 01:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
did find out that there is no standard
 
01:37:30.430 --> 01:37:30.440 align:start position:0%
operating procedure for for what to do
 
01:37:33.830 --> 01:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
with the vacated CTE space but that one
 
01:37:36.310 --> 01:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
is needed and my hope is that this might
 
01:37:39.470 --> 01:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
be the the the springboard to to get
 
01:37:42.030 --> 01:37:42.040 align:start position:0%
something like that done and with that
 
01:37:45.229 --> 01:37:45.239 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I conclude my testimony and
 
01:37:47.669 --> 01:37:47.679 align:start position:0%
be happy to take questions thank you
 
01:37:49.189 --> 01:37:49.199 align:start position:0%
very much represent we learn something
 
01:37:51.910 --> 01:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
every day I just learned a lot about
 
01:37:57.350 --> 01:37:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:00.109 --> 01:38:00.119 align:start position:0%
committee yeah yes representative Damon
 
01:38:02.149 --> 01:38:02.159 align:start position:0%
then representative
 
01:38:04.470 --> 01:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
P thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
01:38:05.750 --> 01:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
01:38:08.430 --> 01:38:08.440 align:start position:0%
question I think I need a little
 
01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:10.270 align:start position:0%
question I think I need a little
clarification

01:38:10.270 --> 01:38:10.280 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
01:38:14.109 --> 01:38:14.119 align:start position:0%
um so if I understand this proposal
 
01:38:17.470 --> 01:38:17.480 align:start position:0%
correctly the space being vacated still
 
01:38:21.430 --> 01:38:21.440 align:start position:0%
needs to be used for CTE or it doesn't
 
01:38:23.750 --> 01:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
still need to be used for CTE under the
 
01:38:25.990 --> 01:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
law it would have to be used exclusively
 
01:38:29.229 --> 01:38:29.239 align:start position:0%
for CTE but in your proposed legislation
 
01:38:31.390 --> 01:38:31.400 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm I'm I'm saying that if has been
 
01:38:34.550 --> 01:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
used for 20 years then it has run its
 
01:38:37.950 --> 01:38:37.960 align:start position:0%
course and if that uh space needs to be
 
01:38:42.390 --> 01:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
used for general education another CTE
 
01:38:46.030 --> 01:38:46.040 align:start position:0%
program um storage
 
01:38:49.950 --> 01:38:49.960 align:start position:0%
space i i purposely left it open to be
 
01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:51.790 align:start position:0%
space i i purposely left it open to be
just

01:38:51.790 --> 01:38:51.800 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:38:56.030 --> 01:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:58.149 --> 01:38:58.159 align:start position:0%
it would appear please tell me if I'm
 
01:39:00.750 --> 01:39:00.760 align:start position:0%
correct about this that this does not
 
01:39:03.790 --> 01:39:03.800 align:start position:0%
address the situation where a district
 
01:39:06.430 --> 01:39:06.440 align:start position:0%
might be interested in using CTE space
 
01:39:09.750 --> 01:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
for non CTE purposes and they're not
 
01:39:13.149 --> 01:39:13.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:15.470 --> 01:39:15.480 align:start position:0%
expansion and under the current law you
 
01:39:16.990 --> 01:39:17.000 align:start position:0%
could not do
 
01:39:20.870 --> 01:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
that and this doesn't change that no
 
01:39:23.990 --> 01:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
this this with the exception
 
01:39:26.430 --> 01:39:26.440 align:start position:0%
if if you've used it for 20 years it
 
01:39:30.189 --> 01:39:30.199 align:start position:0%
does change so in other words if you had
 
01:39:35.189 --> 01:39:35.199 align:start position:0%
CTE space that uh you had used for 18
 
01:39:38.629 --> 01:39:38.639 align:start position:0%
years and you wanted to repurpose that
 
01:39:40.910 --> 01:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
for something else but again I've got
 
01:39:42.589 --> 01:39:42.599 align:start position:0%
two conditions in here that have to be
 
01:39:45.229 --> 01:39:45.239 align:start position:0%
met number one that it h that it has to
 
01:39:48.709 --> 01:39:48.719 align:start position:0%
have been used for 20 years number two
 
01:39:51.709 --> 01:39:51.719 align:start position:0%
that that it is being vacated because
 
01:39:55.189 --> 01:39:55.199 align:start position:0%
you are expanding that
 
01:39:57.830 --> 01:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
class and in those with those two
 
01:40:00.470 --> 01:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
conditions you may take that old space
 
01:40:02.270 --> 01:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
and repurpose
 
01:40:05.189 --> 01:40:05.199 align:start position:0%
it thank
 
01:40:08.990 --> 01:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
you representa fellow um yes I I
 
01:40:10.350 --> 01:40:10.360 align:start position:0%
understand what you're doing and I think
 
01:40:13.669 --> 01:40:13.679 align:start position:0%
it's a great idea the part that I don't
 
01:40:18.109 --> 01:40:18.119 align:start position:0%
understand is where does it say in
 
01:40:21.310 --> 01:40:21.320 align:start position:0%
statute that if we didn't put your
 
01:40:24.390 --> 01:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
amendment in that they would have to pay
 
01:40:25.830 --> 01:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
back the
 
01:40:29.669 --> 01:40:29.679 align:start position:0%
money yeah as I as I the way I phrased
 
01:40:31.910 --> 01:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
it was it is my understanding that's
 
01:40:35.030 --> 01:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
what I have been told because uh we we
 
01:40:36.750 --> 01:40:36.760 align:start position:0%
brought I'm on the school budget
 
01:40:39.030 --> 01:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
committee and I I brought up this
 
01:40:43.310 --> 01:40:43.320 align:start position:0%
question if uh we could repurpose it and
 
01:40:48.030 --> 01:40:48.040 align:start position:0%
I was told that uh the the district
 
01:40:50.070 --> 01:40:50.080 align:start position:0%
would have to buy the space back from
 
01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:51.390 align:start position:0%
would have to buy the space back from
the

01:40:51.390 --> 01:40:51.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:40:54.270 --> 01:40:54.280 align:start position:0%
state yeah we don't have
 
01:40:56.030 --> 01:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
let me try to give you a little
 
01:40:57.629 --> 01:40:57.639 align:start position:0%
background in another area where the
 
01:40:59.589 --> 01:40:59.599 align:start position:0%
20-year deal is
 
01:41:02.629 --> 01:41:02.639 align:start position:0%
applicable if you receive School
 
01:41:06.510 --> 01:41:06.520 align:start position:0%
building aid for a new renovation
 
01:41:08.430 --> 01:41:08.440 align:start position:0%
project which meets the guidelines other
 
01:41:11.510 --> 01:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
words it's going to cost more than 25%
 
01:41:14.149 --> 01:41:14.159 align:start position:0%
of a new building so you want to
 
01:41:17.750 --> 01:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
renovate the old and if you do that and
 
01:41:20.430 --> 01:41:20.440 align:start position:0%
you accept let's say the $3.5 million to
 
01:41:24.669 --> 01:41:24.679 align:start position:0%
do this and then after 10 years you
 
01:41:26.709 --> 01:41:26.719 align:start position:0%
close this building
 
01:41:30.030 --> 01:41:30.040 align:start position:0%
down then you as a district are still
 
01:41:33.030 --> 01:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
within that 20year window you owe back
 
01:41:35.470 --> 01:41:35.480 align:start position:0%
to the state the amount of the grant you
 
01:41:37.430 --> 01:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
received to construct that building or
 
01:41:40.550 --> 01:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
renovate that building now there is a
 
01:41:43.270 --> 01:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
another provision where if in fact
 
01:41:45.589 --> 01:41:45.599 align:start position:0%
something occurs like the building burns
 
01:41:47.990 --> 01:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
down or something the commissioner of
 
01:41:51.189 --> 01:41:51.199 align:start position:0%
education is allowed to do a waiver
 
01:41:53.550 --> 01:41:53.560 align:start position:0%
process of that for various exceptions
 
01:41:55.910 --> 01:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
that he or she may discern that might be
 
01:41:58.350 --> 01:41:58.360 align:start position:0%
more applicable so I I I'm just trying
 
01:41:59.629 --> 01:41:59.639 align:start position:0%
to figure where you came up with 20
 
01:42:01.390 --> 01:42:01.400 align:start position:0%
years and I started thinking maybe the
 
01:42:04.350 --> 01:42:04.360 align:start position:0%
20 years is already used in that other
 
01:42:07.629 --> 01:42:07.639 align:start position:0%
other area yeah I think I C came up with
 
01:42:09.189 --> 01:42:09.199 align:start position:0%
the 20 years after a talk with
 
01:42:11.350 --> 01:42:11.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner Adel blue there you go yeah
 
01:42:13.629 --> 01:42:13.639 align:start position:0%
and and his his comment was if if you've
 
01:42:16.189 --> 01:42:16.199 align:start position:0%
run the program for 20 years it seems
 
01:42:19.510 --> 01:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
though it's run its course yeah further
 
01:42:21.229 --> 01:42:21.239 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee do
 
01:42:23.390 --> 01:42:23.400 align:start position:0%
we have any other cards other than uh
 
01:42:25.550 --> 01:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
represent Daniels my intent was to get
 
01:42:27.350 --> 01:42:27.360 align:start position:0%
you back on
 
01:42:29.950 --> 01:42:29.960 align:start position:0%
schedule you're doing just that I don't
 
01:42:32.430 --> 01:42:32.440 align:start position:0%
think we are off were we
 
01:42:36.870 --> 01:42:36.880 align:start position:0%
no we've been uh really okay today does
 
01:42:38.270 --> 01:42:38.280 align:start position:0%
the department have anything to add to
 
01:42:40.189 --> 01:42:40.199 align:start position:0%
that Jeff or are you
 
01:42:43.870 --> 01:42:43.880 align:start position:0%
good okay so with that not having any
 
01:42:45.270 --> 01:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
more pink cards we're going to close
 
01:42:46.470 --> 01:42:46.480 align:start position:0%
this hearing thank you very much
 
01:42:48.310 --> 01:42:48.320 align:start position:0%
representative Daniels thank you Mr

his test oh okay I'm sorry I didn't see

02:03:34.910 --> 02:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:36.709 --> 02:03:36.719 align:start position:0%
good morning or good morning almost the
 
02:03:38.149 --> 02:03:38.159 align:start position:0%
end of the morning yeah education
 
02:03:40.069 --> 02:03:40.079 align:start position:0%
funding committee chairman lad and
 
02:03:42.189 --> 02:03:42.199 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
02:03:44.189 --> 02:03:44.199 align:start position:0%
my name is Keith Ammon I represent
 
02:03:46.990 --> 02:03:47.000 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro District 42 and that's New
 
02:03:49.270 --> 02:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
Boston Mount Vernon and line
 
02:03:51.750 --> 02:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
bro so the testimony that I ser
 
02:03:53.870 --> 02:03:53.880 align:start position:0%
circulated here it comes from the chair
 
02:03:56.870 --> 02:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
of our new Boston School Board his name
 
02:03:58.149 --> 02:03:58.159 align:start position:0%
is Bill
 
02:04:01.390 --> 02:04:01.400 align:start position:0%
Schmidt um and the gist of what we're
 
02:04:03.750 --> 02:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
trying to do with this with this bill is
 
02:04:05.069 --> 02:04:05.079 align:start position:0%
eliminate a
 
02:04:08.189 --> 02:04:08.199 align:start position:0%
mandate so New Boston we have a central
 
02:04:10.830 --> 02:04:10.840 align:start position:0%
school it's a it's K through
 
02:04:14.750 --> 02:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
six and we still have half day
 
02:04:17.750 --> 02:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
kindergarten so what we're finding or
 
02:04:19.149 --> 02:04:19.159 align:start position:0%
what what the school board in town is
 
02:04:23.390 --> 02:04:23.400 align:start position:0%
finding is that mandates on busing and
 
02:04:27.629 --> 02:04:27.639 align:start position:0%
lunches uh meal service are overly
 
02:04:30.430 --> 02:04:30.440 align:start position:0%
restrictive for our situation and so
 
02:04:33.990 --> 02:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
this testimony here from Cher Schmidt
 
02:04:35.270 --> 02:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
I'll just I won't read the whole thing
 
02:04:37.510 --> 02:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
because you have it in front of you but
 
02:04:37.520 --> 02:04:38.350 align:start position:0%
because you have it in front of you but
we

02:04:38.350 --> 02:04:38.360 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:04:40.790 --> 02:04:40.800 align:start position:0%
have we currently have second paragraph
 
02:04:42.910 --> 02:04:42.920 align:start position:0%
we currently have halfday kindergarten
 
02:04:45.149 --> 02:04:45.159 align:start position:0%
program and have not implemented a full
 
02:04:47.910 --> 02:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
day program due to space and cost
 
02:04:49.950 --> 02:04:49.960 align:start position:0%
constraints this program has worked out
 
02:04:52.350 --> 02:04:52.360 align:start position:0%
well for our students so he goes on to
 
02:04:55.310 --> 02:04:55.320 align:start position:0%
talk about how it's been part of the
 
02:04:58.189 --> 02:04:58.199 align:start position:0%
culture in town that parents uh in the
 
02:05:00.709 --> 02:05:00.719 align:start position:0%
school cooperate on making sure the half
 
02:05:02.350 --> 02:05:02.360 align:start position:0%
day students end up where they're
 
02:05:05.589 --> 02:05:05.599 align:start position:0%
supposed to be after the the half day is
 
02:05:07.669 --> 02:05:07.679 align:start position:0%
over so and that has worked out well for
 
02:05:11.149 --> 02:05:11.159 align:start position:0%
our town um the fourth paragraph when it
 
02:05:13.790 --> 02:05:13.800 align:start position:0%
comes to meals we already have a short
 
02:05:15.589 --> 02:05:15.599 align:start position:0%
period of time when these children are
 
02:05:17.470 --> 02:05:17.480 align:start position:0%
at school the meal requirement not only
 
02:05:20.430 --> 02:05:20.440 align:start position:0%
adds unnecessary cost but takes away
 
02:05:22.430 --> 02:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
from instruction time so I thought that
 
02:05:24.669 --> 02:05:24.679 align:start position:0%
was a Salient
 
02:05:28.589 --> 02:05:28.599 align:start position:0%
point and uh he concludes by asking the
 
02:05:30.549 --> 02:05:30.559 align:start position:0%
committee to recommend ought to pass on
 
02:05:33.189 --> 02:05:33.199 align:start position:0%
this legislation so with that you guys
 
02:05:36.629 --> 02:05:36.639 align:start position:0%
are the experts on on education funding
 
02:05:38.229 --> 02:05:38.239 align:start position:0%
but that's the intent of what we're
 
02:05:41.510 --> 02:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
trying to do is eliminate mandates that
 
02:05:44.189 --> 02:05:44.199 align:start position:0%
apply more to full day kindergarten and
 
02:05:48.069 --> 02:05:48.079 align:start position:0%
that are a little awkward for our school
 
02:05:50.709 --> 02:05:50.719 align:start position:0%
district thank you very much uh are
 
02:05:52.350 --> 02:05:52.360 align:start position:0%

02:05:54.109 --> 02:05:54.119 align:start position:0%

02:07:14.790 --> 02:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
geographically widespread
 
02:07:17.430 --> 02:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
District I mean if you've been to New
 
02:07:19.790 --> 02:07:19.800 align:start position:0%
Boston it's a have not not it's not a
 
02:07:21.549 --> 02:07:21.559 align:start position:0%
big town but it's not a Tiny Town either
 
02:07:22.870 --> 02:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
either so we have a lot of Hills and
 
02:07:25.830 --> 02:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
Valleys and windy roads in town that can
 
02:07:27.549 --> 02:07:27.559 align:start position:0%
add some time to trips and
 
02:07:27.559 --> 02:07:29.229 align:start position:0%
add some time to trips and
transportation

02:07:29.229 --> 02:07:29.239 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
02:07:34.149 --> 02:07:34.159 align:start position:0%
so okay further questions from the
 
02:07:36.350 --> 02:07:36.360 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any thank you very
 
02:07:38.350 --> 02:07:38.360 align:start position:0%

02:08:24.510 --> 02:08:24.520 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman lad and and

honorable members of the committee my
 
02:08:28.750 --> 02:08:28.760 align:start position:0%
name is Laura milikin I'm the executive
 
02:08:30.109 --> 02:08:30.119 align:start position:0%
director of New Hampshire hunger
 
02:08:32.510 --> 02:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
Solutions we appreciate the opportunity
 
02:08:36.229 --> 02:08:36.239 align:start position:0%
to testify today in opposition to uh HB
 
02:08:38.910 --> 02:08:38.920 align:start position:0%
319 we're a Statewide nonpartisan
 
02:08:40.990 --> 02:08:41.000 align:start position:0%
nonprofit organization that Advocates to
 
02:08:43.189 --> 02:08:43.199 align:start position:0%
end food insecurity improve Equitable
 
02:08:45.109 --> 02:08:45.119 align:start position:0%
access to nutritious food and address
 
02:08:47.470 --> 02:08:47.480 align:start position:0%
hunger root causes for all New Hampshire
 
02:08:50.470 --> 02:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
residents we all agree that children
 
02:08:52.950 --> 02:08:52.960 align:start position:0%
should have an equal opportunity at
 
02:08:56.229 --> 02:08:56.239 align:start position:0%
success in school and in life we agree
 
02:08:58.830 --> 02:08:58.840 align:start position:0%
that children need a classroom a teacher
 
02:09:02.629 --> 02:09:02.639 align:start position:0%
books curriculum but access to meals is
 
02:09:05.109 --> 02:09:05.119 align:start position:0%
even more important because children
 
02:09:07.430 --> 02:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
cannot learn when they're
 
02:09:10.229 --> 02:09:10.239 align:start position:0%
hungry this bill comes at a time that we
 
02:09:12.229 --> 02:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
know that many families are struggling
 
02:09:14.510 --> 02:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
to make ends meet and food insecurity
 
02:09:16.990 --> 02:09:17.000 align:start position:0%
has been increasing the Census Data tell
 
02:09:18.750 --> 02:09:18.760 align:start position:0%
us that currently over a third of
 
02:09:20.830 --> 02:09:20.840 align:start position:0%
households with children are reporting
 
02:09:23.390 --> 02:09:23.400 align:start position:0%
that they have sufficient food School
 
02:09:25.549 --> 02:09:25.559 align:start position:0%
meals are essential to providing
 
02:09:27.310 --> 02:09:27.320 align:start position:0%
children with the nutrition they need to
 
02:09:29.910 --> 02:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
succeed in school many Studies have
 
02:09:33.030 --> 02:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
found that children who eat uh School
 
02:09:35.470 --> 02:09:35.480 align:start position:0%
meals have better nutrition better
 
02:09:37.430 --> 02:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
physical and mental health and I've
 
02:09:40.350 --> 02:09:40.360 align:start position:0%
provided you with the research about
 
02:09:44.709 --> 02:09:44.719 align:start position:0%
that kindergarten is fundamental to the
 
02:09:47.350 --> 02:09:47.360 align:start position:0%
rest of a child's academic
 
02:09:49.510 --> 02:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
career this bill would take away
 
02:09:51.430 --> 02:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
nutritious meals from some of our
 
02:09:53.189 --> 02:09:53.199 align:start position:0%
youngest students threatening their
 
02:09:55.830 --> 02:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
ability to focus and learn please vote
 
02:09:59.189 --> 02:09:59.199 align:start position:0%
in expediate to legislate on HB 319
 
02:10:01.549 --> 02:10:01.559 align:start position:0%
because every child deserves an equal
 
02:10:03.229 --> 02:10:03.239 align:start position:0%
opportunity to
 
02:10:05.510 --> 02:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
succeed thank you thank you very much
 
02:10:09.229 --> 02:10:09.239 align:start position:0%
are there questions from our
 
02:10:12.510 --> 02:10:12.520 align:start position:0%
committee yes representa luno thanks
 
02:10:14.149 --> 02:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
thanks very much Mr chair and thank you
 
02:10:16.149 --> 02:10:16.159 align:start position:0%
very much M Milligan for joining us
 
02:10:20.910 --> 02:10:20.920 align:start position:0%
again um you know as as the the the bill
 
02:10:24.629 --> 02:10:24.639 align:start position:0%
applies to both transportation and um
 
02:10:27.629 --> 02:10:27.639 align:start position:0%
and food nutrition programs and meals so
 
02:10:30.870 --> 02:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
and and seems to uh eliminate the
 
02:10:34.950 --> 02:10:34.960 align:start position:0%
requirement to provide either to um to
 
02:10:37.950 --> 02:10:37.960 align:start position:0%
students who attend half day uh
 
02:10:39.870 --> 02:10:39.880 align:start position:0%
kindergarten programs is that is that
 
02:10:43.149 --> 02:10:43.159 align:start position:0%
your read on that is my read yeah yeah
 
02:10:48.149 --> 02:10:48.159 align:start position:0%
thanks thanks and and um and so so in in
 
02:10:51.310 --> 02:10:51.320 align:start position:0%
a situation where where a student
 
02:10:54.229 --> 02:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
student is um and we're talking about
 
02:10:55.790 --> 02:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
what 5year
 
02:10:59.270 --> 02:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
olds you know um attending a halfday
 
02:11:01.669 --> 02:11:01.679 align:start position:0%
kindergarten program what could their if
 
02:11:03.629 --> 02:11:03.639 align:start position:0%
they were attending a halfday morning
 
02:11:06.750 --> 02:11:06.760 align:start position:0%
program or a halfday afternoon program
 
02:11:08.629 --> 02:11:08.639 align:start position:0%
what would their day look like or what
 
02:11:11.149 --> 02:11:11.159 align:start position:0%
could their day look like from the time
 
02:11:13.830 --> 02:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
they leave home
 
02:11:18.510 --> 02:11:18.520 align:start position:0%
um get to school and then get back
 
02:11:22.229 --> 02:11:22.239 align:start position:0%
home you know in terms of um
 
02:11:23.870 --> 02:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
actually having a
 
02:11:27.350 --> 02:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
meal so you know it of course varies by
 
02:11:31.189 --> 02:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
School District um but uh I'm really
 
02:11:32.950 --> 02:11:32.960 align:start position:0%
saying like in the worst case if you're
 
02:11:36.669 --> 02:11:36.679 align:start position:0%
if you're not providing Transportation
 
02:11:40.149 --> 02:11:40.159 align:start position:0%
or meals in the worst case they would be
 
02:11:42.030 --> 02:11:42.040 align:start position:0%
in half toe kindergarten in the morning
 
02:11:44.870 --> 02:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
leave school without breakfast get uh if
 
02:11:46.790 --> 02:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
this bill pass they could get to school
 
02:11:49.189 --> 02:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
and have no breakfast it would be very
 
02:11:51.390 --> 02:11:51.400 align:start position:0%
difficult for such a child to to
 
02:11:53.669 --> 02:11:53.679 align:start position:0%
concentrate they would likely I mean
 
02:11:55.629 --> 02:11:55.639 align:start position:0%
5-year-olds they would likely act out
 
02:11:57.830 --> 02:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
because they're hungry um you know it is
 
02:11:59.870 --> 02:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
not uh it's not a benefit to school
 
02:12:04.709 --> 02:12:04.719 align:start position:0%
districts to not feed kids um and um you
 
02:12:07.470 --> 02:12:07.480 align:start position:0%
know I mean without transportation I
 
02:12:08.910 --> 02:12:08.920 align:start position:0%
don't I don't know how they get to
 
02:12:10.950 --> 02:12:10.960 align:start position:0%
school I uh you know I spent many years
 
02:12:13.030 --> 02:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
working in early childhood policy and I
 
02:12:15.990 --> 02:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
certainly understand that um children
 
02:12:20.510 --> 02:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
who aren't able to get uh the Early
 
02:12:20.520 --> 02:12:21.790 align:start position:0%
who aren't able to get uh the Early
Education

02:12:21.790 --> 02:12:21.800 align:start position:0%
Education
 
02:12:23.109 --> 02:12:23.119 align:start position:0%
um that they need are not ready for
 
02:12:25.350 --> 02:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
school when they come they are at a
 
02:12:27.750 --> 02:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
significant disadvantage um and so we
 
02:12:29.750 --> 02:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
just we just don't want to disident into
 
02:12:33.149 --> 02:12:33.159 align:start position:0%
our kids in any way um and so we need to
 
02:12:35.910 --> 02:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
to feed them and transport them thank
 
02:12:42.870 --> 02:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:46.069 --> 02:12:46.079 align:start position:0%
yes um my question is were you are you
 
02:12:48.030 --> 02:12:48.040 align:start position:0%
talking about providing them with a
 
02:12:50.709 --> 02:12:50.719 align:start position:0%
breakfast meal before they begin their
 
02:12:54.069 --> 02:12:54.079 align:start position:0%
class or are you talking about providing
 
02:12:56.510 --> 02:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
them with like a bag lunch to take with
 
02:12:56.520 --> 02:12:58.470 align:start position:0%
them with like a bag lunch to take with
them

02:12:58.470 --> 02:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:13:01.709 --> 02:13:01.719 align:start position:0%
um what what exactly
 
02:13:03.750 --> 02:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
um because I understand what you're
 
02:13:06.030 --> 02:13:06.040 align:start position:0%
saying about uh the young children
 
02:13:08.830 --> 02:13:08.840 align:start position:0%
without having breakfast I've been there
 
02:13:11.830 --> 02:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
so I understand what that means and is
 
02:13:13.709 --> 02:13:13.719 align:start position:0%
that what you're talking about providing
 
02:13:16.629 --> 02:13:16.639 align:start position:0%
something before they begin
 
02:13:19.350 --> 02:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
school so the bill doesn't address which
 
02:13:23.990 --> 02:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
meal um uh the Bill addresses uh the
 
02:13:25.990 --> 02:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
fact that um schools are currently
 
02:13:29.470 --> 02:13:29.480 align:start position:0%
required to offer a meal to students um
 
02:13:32.350 --> 02:13:32.360 align:start position:0%
and so I would certainly I would
 
02:13:34.870 --> 02:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
certainly like it if um schools offered
 
02:13:39.069 --> 02:13:39.079 align:start position:0%
breakfast and lunch um I think that um
 
02:13:43.149 --> 02:13:43.159 align:start position:0%
you know whether it's uh in a a bag or
 
02:13:46.069 --> 02:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
in um in the cafeteria um it doesn't
 
02:13:47.910 --> 02:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
matter as long as it you know meets
 
02:13:51.149 --> 02:13:51.159 align:start position:0%
nutritional requirements I you know
 
02:13:53.069 --> 02:13:53.079 align:start position:0%
every children child deserves to have a
 
02:13:56.310 --> 02:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
nutritious meal um if they're expected
 
02:13:58.510 --> 02:13:58.520 align:start position:0%
to be able to function in
 
02:14:00.830 --> 02:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
school thank you very much are there
 
02:14:03.589 --> 02:14:03.599 align:start position:0%
further questions yes representa
 
02:14:05.870 --> 02:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
02:14:08.470 --> 02:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
being here and helping us with
 
02:14:12.750 --> 02:14:12.760 align:start position:0%
this there is a statement in the written
 
02:14:15.430 --> 02:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
it wasn't presented fully testimony from
 
02:14:17.990 --> 02:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
the chair of the school board who
 
02:14:22.069 --> 02:14:22.079 align:start position:0%
requested this um proposed legislation
 
02:14:24.830 --> 02:14:24.840 align:start position:0%
that um the meal requirement would not
 
02:14:26.870 --> 02:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
only add unnecessary cost but it takes
 
02:14:29.669 --> 02:14:29.679 align:start position:0%
away from instruction
 
02:14:32.149 --> 02:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
time I'm interested in your perspective
 
02:14:34.750 --> 02:14:34.760 align:start position:0%
on the validity of that statement it
 
02:14:36.390 --> 02:14:36.400 align:start position:0%
seems to me there are a number of ways
 
02:14:38.109 --> 02:14:38.119 align:start position:0%
that males can be provided that do not
 
02:14:40.790 --> 02:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
take away from instruction time thank
 
02:14:44.149 --> 02:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
you for the question I I think that um
 
02:14:46.270 --> 02:14:46.280 align:start position:0%
what I what I said before and what I
 
02:14:49.149 --> 02:14:49.159 align:start position:0%
what I believe the research shows is
 
02:14:51.189 --> 02:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
that children have a much better chance
 
02:14:54.350 --> 02:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
of success when they've eaten breakfast
 
02:14:58.270 --> 02:14:58.280 align:start position:0%
um that children can't learn like all of
 
02:14:59.990 --> 02:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
us when we're hungry we have difficulty
 
02:15:03.030 --> 02:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
focusing and and a 5-year-old has a much
 
02:15:05.669 --> 02:15:05.679 align:start position:0%
harder time um and so we want to make
 
02:15:07.750 --> 02:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
sure that they have the tools they need
 
02:15:11.549 --> 02:15:11.559 align:start position:0%
to be able to succeed in school um and I
 
02:15:15.270 --> 02:15:15.280 align:start position:0%
think that um the the instructional time
 
02:15:17.549 --> 02:15:17.559 align:start position:0%
you know I mean children at that age act
 
02:15:20.629 --> 02:15:20.639 align:start position:0%
out when they are hungry um so I think
 
02:15:22.830 --> 02:15:22.840 align:start position:0%
that the idea that you would be saving
 
02:15:27.229 --> 02:15:27.239 align:start position:0%
instructional time um is is uh not is a
 
02:15:29.830 --> 02:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
fallacy I just don't think that's real
 
02:15:32.390 --> 02:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:36.350 --> 02:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
much one one more question that's it I
 
02:15:38.430 --> 02:15:38.440 align:start position:0%
have other question you know nutrition
 
02:15:40.189 --> 02:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
is interesting to
 
02:15:40.199 --> 02:15:42.069 align:start position:0%
is interesting to
me

02:15:42.069 --> 02:15:42.079 align:start position:0%
me
 
02:15:46.589 --> 02:15:46.599 align:start position:0%
um so am I correct that it would be
 
02:15:49.030 --> 02:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
possible for a district with a half day
 
02:15:51.149 --> 02:15:51.159 align:start position:0%
kindergarten program where children are
 
02:15:53.830 --> 02:15:53.840 align:start position:0%
certainly having a snack of some sort
 
02:15:55.750 --> 02:15:55.760 align:start position:0%
during the morning whether parent or
 
02:15:55.760 --> 02:15:56.870 align:start position:0%
during the morning whether parent or
District

02:15:56.870 --> 02:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
District
 
02:15:59.990 --> 02:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
provided can the school create a
 
02:16:02.149 --> 02:16:02.159 align:start position:0%
situation where they make that snack
 
02:16:07.470 --> 02:16:07.480 align:start position:0%
qualify as a meal per the federal meal
 
02:16:10.510 --> 02:16:10.520 align:start position:0%
standards uh I don't know the answer to
 
02:16:12.390 --> 02:16:12.400 align:start position:0%
that I'm sorry to say I can get back to
 
02:16:13.830 --> 02:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
you on that that's a question that you
 
02:16:15.189 --> 02:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
might want to ask the Department of
 
02:16:18.229 --> 02:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
Education um or or you know or folks who
 
02:16:20.229 --> 02:16:20.239 align:start position:0%
were a little more familiar with the ins
 
02:16:22.910 --> 02:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
and outs of the of the USDA requirements
 
02:16:26.830 --> 02:16:26.840 align:start position:0%
than I am okay thank you thank you um so
 
02:16:28.990 --> 02:16:29.000 align:start position:0%
what I'd like to do now if we do have
 
02:16:31.470 --> 02:16:31.480 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education here and I
 
02:16:33.150 --> 02:16:33.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
02:16:37.589 --> 02:16:37.599 align:start position:0%
let's switch it to the doe right now and
 
02:16:39.549 --> 02:16:39.559 align:start position:0%
I have one question then I'm going to
 
02:16:43.549 --> 02:16:43.559 align:start position:0%
open it up to the representatives
 
02:16:46.509 --> 02:16:46.519 align:start position:0%
here how many halfday kindergarten
 
02:16:48.950 --> 02:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
programs do we have in the state and
 
02:16:51.589 --> 02:16:51.599 align:start position:0%
that the second part of that question is
 
02:16:54.950 --> 02:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
when I was in the a school principal in
 
02:16:57.230 --> 02:16:57.240 align:start position:0%
the other state I came from which was
 
02:16:59.549 --> 02:16:59.559 align:start position:0%
Alaska we'd have the kids in the half
 
02:17:01.790 --> 02:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
day program come in because our school
 
02:17:04.429 --> 02:17:04.439 align:start position:0%
wasn't large enough to contain all the
 
02:17:06.309 --> 02:17:06.319 align:start position:0%
students so we split this particular
 
02:17:08.509 --> 02:17:08.519 align:start position:0%
group up one group would come in the
 
02:17:11.990 --> 02:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
morning stay through lunch the other
 
02:17:15.110 --> 02:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
group would come in prior to lunch and
 
02:17:17.030 --> 02:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
come to the end of the day and and after
 
02:17:18.750 --> 02:17:18.760 align:start position:0%
the first group's done lunch then they
 
02:17:21.389 --> 02:17:21.399 align:start position:0%
went home but we provided that social
 
02:17:22.950 --> 02:17:22.960 align:start position:0%
experience for both groups to get to
 
02:17:25.230 --> 02:17:25.240 align:start position:0%
know each other at that lunch time and
 
02:17:26.629 --> 02:17:26.639 align:start position:0%
they both receive the meal and they
 
02:17:29.509 --> 02:17:29.519 align:start position:0%
receive Transportation on the buses uh
 
02:17:31.070 --> 02:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
do we have any programs operating like
 
02:17:32.509 --> 02:17:32.519 align:start position:0%
that in the state that have these half
 
02:17:34.070 --> 02:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
day programs due to maybe space
 
02:17:36.389 --> 02:17:36.399 align:start position:0%
availability in the building well so
 
02:17:37.629 --> 02:17:37.639 align:start position:0%
white division director for learner
 
02:17:40.750 --> 02:17:40.760 align:start position:0%
Support Department of Education um every
 
02:17:42.309 --> 02:17:42.319 align:start position:0%
school in their Logistics on how they're
 
02:17:44.509 --> 02:17:44.519 align:start position:0%
serving meals is a little bit different
 
02:17:48.030 --> 02:17:48.040 align:start position:0%
I think the um component I wanted to
 
02:17:51.790 --> 02:17:51.800 align:start position:0%
speak to is that the the US Department
 
02:17:51.800 --> 02:17:52.509 align:start position:0%
speak to is that the the US Department
of

02:17:52.509 --> 02:17:52.519 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:17:54.750 --> 02:17:54.760 align:start position:0%
Agriculture um national school lunch
 
02:17:56.709 --> 02:17:56.719 align:start position:0%
program and the school breakfast program
 
02:18:01.429 --> 02:18:01.439 align:start position:0%
requires a meal to be offered to every
 
02:18:03.790 --> 02:18:03.800 align:start position:0%
student regardless of whether they're
 
02:18:06.549 --> 02:18:06.559 align:start position:0%
full-time or part-time in order to
 
02:18:09.030 --> 02:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
participate in that
 
02:18:12.790 --> 02:18:12.800 align:start position:0%
program so if it's a federal
 
02:18:15.190 --> 02:18:15.200 align:start position:0%
requirement that that I think pretty
 
02:18:18.990 --> 02:18:19.000 align:start position:0%
much sums it up so in followup to that
 
02:18:21.509 --> 02:18:21.519 align:start position:0%
though if if they require that every
 
02:18:24.309 --> 02:18:24.319 align:start position:0%
student had this every student should be
 
02:18:27.469 --> 02:18:27.479 align:start position:0%
offered offered meal okay offered so
 
02:18:30.549 --> 02:18:30.559 align:start position:0%
changing it and that's for the all all
 
02:18:32.030 --> 02:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
students that attend that school
 
02:18:34.990 --> 02:18:35.000 align:start position:0%
regardless of their grade level correct
 
02:18:38.629 --> 02:18:38.639 align:start position:0%
so if you have grades let's say one
 
02:18:38.639 --> 02:18:40.190 align:start position:0%
so if you have grades let's say one
through

02:18:40.190 --> 02:18:40.200 align:start position:0%
through
 
02:18:42.669 --> 02:18:42.679 align:start position:0%
six getting involved in this program but
 
02:18:47.669 --> 02:18:47.679 align:start position:0%
the kids in grade K aren't getting that
 
02:18:49.509 --> 02:18:49.519 align:start position:0%
is that in violation of what you just
 
02:18:49.519 --> 02:18:51.349 align:start position:0%
is that in violation of what you just
said

02:18:51.349 --> 02:18:51.359 align:start position:0%
said
 
02:18:53.669 --> 02:18:53.679 align:start position:0%
that is in violation okay and when we
 
02:18:57.230 --> 02:18:57.240 align:start position:0%
find schools that are conducting that we
 
02:18:59.349 --> 02:18:59.359 align:start position:0%
make sure that they offer a meal to
 
02:18:59.359 --> 02:19:00.429 align:start position:0%
make sure that they offer a meal to
those

02:19:00.429 --> 02:19:00.439 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:19:03.070 --> 02:19:03.080 align:start position:0%
students any other questions for Melissa
 
02:19:03.080 --> 02:19:04.790 align:start position:0%
students any other questions for Melissa
white

02:19:04.790 --> 02:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
white
 
02:19:06.830 --> 02:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
yes I'm sorry because I might have
 
02:19:08.509 --> 02:19:08.519 align:start position:0%
missed something did you say that these
 
02:19:09.950 --> 02:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
are for the schools that are accepting
 
02:19:11.870 --> 02:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
the federal money for the federal school
 
02:19:13.870 --> 02:19:13.880 align:start position:0%
program if the school is participating
 
02:19:15.509 --> 02:19:15.519 align:start position:0%
in the national school lunch program or
 
02:19:18.190 --> 02:19:18.200 align:start position:0%
the school breakfast program so followup
 
02:19:20.070 --> 02:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
mhm so is it possible that we have
 
02:19:22.030 --> 02:19:22.040 align:start position:0%
schools that are not participating in
 
02:19:23.469 --> 02:19:23.479 align:start position:0%
that program like such as the charter
 
02:19:23.479 --> 02:19:24.910 align:start position:0%
that program like such as the charter
school

02:19:24.910 --> 02:19:24.920 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:19:30.030 --> 02:19:30.040 align:start position:0%
right thank you and we have um 440
 
02:19:31.830 --> 02:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
schools throughout the state that are
 
02:19:35.669 --> 02:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:37.750 --> 02:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
programs oh I don't have that one off
 
02:19:40.549 --> 02:19:40.559 align:start position:0%
the top of my list
 
02:19:43.870 --> 02:19:43.880 align:start position:0%
here I can get that to you
 
02:19:46.910 --> 02:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
though there are a few I can remember
 
02:19:48.670 --> 02:19:48.680 align:start position:0%
representative B speaking to his
 
02:19:50.910 --> 02:19:50.920 align:start position:0%
community was one which they had their
 
02:19:52.510 --> 02:19:52.520 align:start position:0%
own meal
 
02:19:56.670 --> 02:19:56.680 align:start position:0%
program yeah so
 
02:20:00.150 --> 02:20:00.160 align:start position:0%
that if this was to be
 
02:20:04.270 --> 02:20:04.280 align:start position:0%
passed then you really couldn't
 
02:20:07.389 --> 02:20:07.399 align:start position:0%
require the school to be serving meals
 
02:20:10.270 --> 02:20:10.280 align:start position:0%
at the reduced C rate reduced cost rate
 
02:20:11.550 --> 02:20:11.560 align:start position:0%
and meeting the federal income
 
02:20:13.790 --> 02:20:13.800 align:start position:0%
eligibility guidelines because you
 
02:20:17.349 --> 02:20:17.359 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to access the USDA
 
02:20:20.910 --> 02:20:20.920 align:start position:0%
programs so
 
02:20:24.349 --> 02:20:24.359 align:start position:0%
hey yes represent repres thank you Mr
 
02:20:26.710 --> 02:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks for taking my question
 
02:20:29.070 --> 02:20:29.080 align:start position:0%
so the letter we have from New Boston
 
02:20:32.630 --> 02:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
says they have obtained a waiver for
 
02:20:35.670 --> 02:20:35.680 align:start position:0%
this uh meal requirement is that from
 
02:20:37.190 --> 02:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
your department from the federal
 
02:20:39.550 --> 02:20:39.560 align:start position:0%
government from um so that would be from
 
02:20:41.309 --> 02:20:41.319 align:start position:0%
our department but that's a waiver to
 
02:20:46.150 --> 02:20:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:49.070 --> 02:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
compliance all right maybe may I follow
 
02:20:50.790 --> 02:20:50.800 align:start position:0%
yeah that they they were found to not
 
02:20:52.590 --> 02:20:52.600 align:start position:0%
offered that program and so if you're
 
02:20:54.070 --> 02:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
operating the national school lunch
 
02:20:55.870 --> 02:20:55.880 align:start position:0%
program or the school breakfast program
 
02:20:57.910 --> 02:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
you have to make a meal available so if
 
02:20:59.910 --> 02:20:59.920 align:start position:0%
it's found that a school is not making
 
02:21:02.110 --> 02:21:02.120 align:start position:0%
that meal available they can have a
 
02:21:04.710 --> 02:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
temporary waiver but then they have to
 
02:21:07.110 --> 02:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
come into compliance with that
 
02:21:09.349 --> 02:21:09.359 align:start position:0%
requirement and changing the state law
 
02:21:12.190 --> 02:21:12.200 align:start position:0%
is not going to change the federal
 
02:21:17.309 --> 02:21:17.319 align:start position:0%
law thank you wow look they're scooting
 
02:21:20.710 --> 02:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
around repesent fellows yes thank you
 
02:21:24.590 --> 02:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
you um it's my understanding that
 
02:21:26.830 --> 02:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
waivers have been issued to schools and
 
02:21:29.510 --> 02:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
there are also my understanding that
 
02:21:31.990 --> 02:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
this apply does this apply to Charter
 
02:21:34.110 --> 02:21:34.120 align:start position:0%
Schools if the charter school is
 
02:21:35.950 --> 02:21:35.960 align:start position:0%
operating the national school lunch
 
02:21:38.309 --> 02:21:38.319 align:start position:0%
program or the school breakfast program
 
02:21:41.830 --> 02:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
then yes are but if they are not then no
 
02:21:43.270 --> 02:21:43.280 align:start position:0%
are are they
 
02:21:47.790 --> 02:21:47.800 align:start position:0%
not required to no school is required to
 
02:21:50.150 --> 02:21:50.160 align:start position:0%
operate those programs but they have if
 
02:21:54.710 --> 02:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
they want want to partake in the um meal
 
02:21:56.670 --> 02:21:56.680 align:start position:0%
program and be able to offer free meals
 
02:21:59.590 --> 02:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
and reduceed price meals then
 
02:22:02.110 --> 02:22:02.120 align:start position:0%
yes it's a school's choice though
 
02:22:04.830 --> 02:22:04.840 align:start position:0%
schools can choose not to operate those
 
02:22:04.840 --> 02:22:07.630 align:start position:0%
schools can choose not to operate those
programs

02:22:07.630 --> 02:22:07.640 align:start position:0%
programs
 
02:22:11.190 --> 02:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
okay so and follow quickly on on that is
 
02:22:11.200 --> 02:22:12.110 align:start position:0%
okay so and follow quickly on on that is
there

02:22:12.110 --> 02:22:12.120 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:22:16.270 --> 02:22:16.280 align:start position:0%
a criteria or conditions which the
 
02:22:18.830 --> 02:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
federal government have that a waiver to
 
02:22:21.270 --> 02:22:21.280 align:start position:0%
the program be can be given
 
02:22:23.790 --> 02:22:23.800 align:start position:0%
yes is there where can I find the
 
02:22:24.870 --> 02:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
information I can send that to the
 
02:22:27.070 --> 02:22:27.080 align:start position:0%
committee so it stipulates here's your
 
02:22:29.590 --> 02:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
waivers possible areas you can waiver
 
02:22:31.309 --> 02:22:31.319 align:start position:0%
for and it really gives us the
 
02:22:33.030 --> 02:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to then provide technical
 
02:22:35.870 --> 02:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
assistance our department our uh
 
02:22:38.270 --> 02:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
nutrition program to then help them
 
02:22:40.510 --> 02:22:40.520 align:start position:0%
Implement whatever changes or systems
 
02:22:41.990 --> 02:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
they might need in order to be able to
 
02:22:43.710 --> 02:22:43.720 align:start position:0%
provide and to come into
 
02:22:48.030 --> 02:22:48.040 align:start position:0%
compliance thank you yes so the waiver
 
02:22:50.070 --> 02:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
is temporary it's not like you're going
 
02:22:53.230 --> 02:22:53.240 align:start position:0%
to have forever and ever correct okay
 
02:22:54.750 --> 02:22:54.760 align:start position:0%
representa Fells you got your second
 
02:22:57.830 --> 02:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
question ready yes I'm wondering if you
 
02:23:00.790 --> 02:23:00.800 align:start position:0%
could give us a list of the waivers that
 
02:23:02.950 --> 02:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
have been granted for the last 5 years
 
02:23:04.349 --> 02:23:04.359 align:start position:0%
because I do believe that there are
 
02:23:07.270 --> 02:23:07.280 align:start position:0%
schools who repeatedly are receiving
 
02:23:10.510 --> 02:23:10.520 align:start position:0%
waivers okay yes further questions from
 
02:23:12.110 --> 02:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
the committee yes
 
02:23:14.230 --> 02:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
representative reading the testimony
 
02:23:17.429 --> 02:23:17.439 align:start position:0%
from New Boston it seems like the the
 
02:23:20.950 --> 02:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
weight of this mandate is the 75,000 in
 
02:23:23.309 --> 02:23:23.319 align:start position:0%
transportation is it possible that the
 
02:23:25.469 --> 02:23:25.479 align:start position:0%
food won't cost near that much the food
 
02:23:27.510 --> 02:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
that's being offered and mandated by the
 
02:23:31.349 --> 02:23:31.359 align:start position:0%
feds is that can we can we divorce the
 
02:23:35.230 --> 02:23:35.240 align:start position:0%
if they're offering a meal to meet the
 
02:23:37.830 --> 02:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
requirements all of those students that
 
02:23:40.429 --> 02:23:40.439 align:start position:0%
are um at a reduced
 
02:23:42.910 --> 02:23:42.920 align:start position:0%
cost there's going to be the feds you
 
02:23:45.790 --> 02:23:45.800 align:start position:0%
know covering a component of that cost
 
02:23:48.750 --> 02:23:48.760 align:start position:0%
plus then there's a cost to the student
 
02:23:50.910 --> 02:23:50.920 align:start position:0%
then for the students that are free
 
02:23:54.150 --> 02:23:54.160 align:start position:0%
that's meal is covered if you're
 
02:23:56.550 --> 02:23:56.560 align:start position:0%
offering a meal to the rest of those
 
02:23:59.030 --> 02:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
students they're paying that cost or
 
02:24:01.030 --> 02:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
depending on whatever that school's
 
02:24:03.750 --> 02:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
policy is for charging for meals so for
 
02:24:06.550 --> 02:24:06.560 align:start position:0%
those children that don't qualify for
 
02:24:08.349 --> 02:24:08.359 align:start position:0%
the free and reduced price lunches if
 
02:24:10.630 --> 02:24:10.640 align:start position:0%
you're offering a meal to them they
 
02:24:15.510 --> 02:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:18.070 --> 02:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
meal can I follow yes go ahead but none
 
02:24:19.590 --> 02:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
of that enters into the cost of the
 
02:24:21.670 --> 02:24:21.680 align:start position:0%
transportation they really are in
 
02:24:23.269 --> 02:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
reality divorced thank you food yeah
 
02:24:25.230 --> 02:24:25.240 align:start position:0%
food and nutrition program completely
 
02:24:28.790 --> 02:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
separate from Transportation
 
02:24:31.550 --> 02:24:31.560 align:start position:0%
costs yes represent
 
02:24:35.190 --> 02:24:35.200 align:start position:0%
Damon so what is the length of time for
 
02:24:38.550 --> 02:24:38.560 align:start position:0%
a temporary waiver in this case I'm not
 
02:24:40.830 --> 02:24:40.840 align:start position:0%
sure so I would have to get that
 
02:24:42.990 --> 02:24:43.000 align:start position:0%
information and give more information on
 
02:24:45.590 --> 02:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
the waiver process thank you appreciate
 
02:24:47.190 --> 02:24:47.200 align:start position:0%
I can look this information I probably
 
02:24:48.870 --> 02:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
find it what's the population of this
 
02:24:51.070 --> 02:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
school in New Boston do you have any
 
02:24:53.590 --> 02:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
idea do they have several sessions of
 
02:24:55.469 --> 02:24:55.479 align:start position:0%
kindergarten that I don't know off the
 
02:24:57.750 --> 02:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
top of my head either Becky maybe you
 
02:24:57.760 --> 02:24:59.510 align:start position:0%
top of my head either Becky maybe you
have

02:24:59.510 --> 02:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:25:02.389 --> 02:25:02.399 align:start position:0%
the so my question would be that where
 
02:25:05.990 --> 02:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
there's a transportation cost a bus has
 
02:25:08.590 --> 02:25:08.600 align:start position:0%
to take the morning kids home or maybe
 
02:25:11.110 --> 02:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
they're not doing that or or bring them
 
02:25:13.510 --> 02:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
to school they're not doing that
 
02:25:15.830 --> 02:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
either they do in the morning when the
 
02:25:17.910 --> 02:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
buses are going by the
 
02:25:22.990 --> 02:25:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:26.429 --> 02:25:26.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:31.990 --> 02:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
evening mid okay I so morning class see
 
02:25:34.309 --> 02:25:34.319 align:start position:0%
usually when you have two the bus brings
 
02:25:36.429 --> 02:25:36.439 align:start position:0%
in and takes the others
 
02:25:46.630 --> 02:25:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:51.750 --> 02:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:56.150 --> 02:25:56.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much appreciate it any
 
02:25:58.710 --> 02:25:58.720 align:start position:0%
other folks that have pink cards or
 
02:26:00.990 --> 02:26:01.000 align:start position:0%
desire to give us some input on this
 
02:26:03.110 --> 02:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
one not seeing it so we're going to
 
02:26:05.510 --> 02:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
close this hearing and the next hearing
 
02:26:16.750 --> 02:26:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:16.760 --> 02:26:18.710 align:start position:0%
 
12:45

02:26:18.710 --> 02:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
12:45
 
02:26:21.750 --> 02:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
only well it this is an EFA bill you
 
02:26:23.510 --> 02:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
never know what's going to go on I want
 
02:26:26.190 --> 02:26:26.200 align:start position:0%
to call I just got to call Kate Baker
 
02:26:28.429 --> 02:26:28.439 align:start position:0%
make sure Kate's here or Matt Southerton
 
02:26:31.070 --> 02:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
here in case there's questions because I
 
02:26:32.630 --> 02:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
don't get in that
 
02:26:36.990 --> 02:26:37.000 align:start position:0%

we're ready to go ahead and start on the
 
03:17:21.710 --> 03:17:21.720 align:start position:0%
hearing at this
 
03:17:24.110 --> 03:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
time uh what we we have in front of us
 
03:17:26.630 --> 03:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
is one bill this afternoon it's HB
 
03:17:29.229 --> 03:17:29.239 align:start position:0%
549 it's relative to the use of
 
03:17:30.990 --> 03:17:31.000 align:start position:0%
Education Freedom account funds in
 
03:17:32.870 --> 03:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
religious schools and institutions of
 
03:17:32.880 --> 03:17:33.950 align:start position:0%
religious schools and institutions of
higher

03:17:33.950 --> 03:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
higher
 
03:17:36.750 --> 03:17:36.760 align:start position:0%
education I I'd like to welcome
 
03:17:39.630 --> 03:17:39.640 align:start position:0%
representative Tim Horgan to present uh
 
03:17:42.070 --> 03:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
the bill as he is the prime sponsor
 
03:17:43.750 --> 03:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much before I sit down
 
03:17:47.229 --> 03:17:47.239 align:start position:0%
I'll uh I've got two two uh two pieces
 
03:17:49.389 --> 03:17:49.399 align:start position:0%
of written material my testimony and
 
03:17:51.229 --> 03:17:51.239 align:start position:0%
then an article from the conquer monitor
 
03:17:54.429 --> 03:17:54.439 align:start position:0%
but so we I've already passed it down to
 
03:17:55.990 --> 03:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
that side of the table but I'll just
 
03:17:57.670 --> 03:17:57.680 align:start position:0%
pass it down the first person on the
 
03:17:59.070 --> 03:17:59.080 align:start position:0%
other side and make sure everybody gets
 
03:18:00.750 --> 03:18:00.760 align:start position:0%
one okay and they they can pass it
 
03:18:00.760 --> 03:18:13.630 align:start position:0%
one okay and they they can pass it
around

03:18:13.630 --> 03:18:13.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:16.429 --> 03:18:16.439 align:start position:0%
yeah I was I was I was expecting a
 
03:18:18.429 --> 03:18:18.439 align:start position:0%
bigger crowd because this is a uh
 
03:18:20.429 --> 03:18:20.439 align:start position:0%
controversial issue but um I guess
 
03:18:22.510 --> 03:18:22.520 align:start position:0%
everybody came to the previous hearing
 
03:18:26.030 --> 03:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
so right I'm T represent Timothy Horan
 
03:18:28.830 --> 03:18:28.840 align:start position:0%
from straford County district 6 which is
 
03:18:32.189 --> 03:18:32.199 align:start position:0%
the town of Durham um also uh one of my
 
03:18:35.389 --> 03:18:35.399 align:start position:0%
fellow straford County District 10 um
 
03:18:37.389 --> 03:18:37.399 align:start position:0%
members is a member of this committee so
 
03:18:42.309 --> 03:18:42.319 align:start position:0%
I see he's here so so
 
03:18:45.750 --> 03:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
um so what this does pretty simply well
 
03:18:47.189 --> 03:18:47.199 align:start position:0%
it does a couple of other things but the
 
03:18:49.590 --> 03:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
main thing it does it forbids using
 
03:18:51.189 --> 03:18:51.199 align:start position:0%
money from the so-called education
 
03:18:52.830 --> 03:18:52.840 align:start position:0%
Freedom account to pay for Religious
 
03:18:56.550 --> 03:18:56.560 align:start position:0%
Education then that program as uh
 
03:18:58.429 --> 03:18:58.439 align:start position:0%
everybody all of you know is sometimes
 
03:19:00.389 --> 03:19:00.399 align:start position:0%
also called the school voucher program
 
03:19:02.990 --> 03:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
but by either name I believe is the
 
03:19:04.950 --> 03:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
program violates several articles of the
 
03:19:07.469 --> 03:19:07.479 align:start position:0%
State Constitution especially part first
 
03:19:11.710 --> 03:19:11.720 align:start position:0%
article six um and uh I don't know do
 
03:19:13.030 --> 03:19:13.040 align:start position:0%
you want me to read the whole thing or
 
03:19:14.790 --> 03:19:14.800 align:start position:0%
it's you've got you've got the text it
 
03:19:16.990 --> 03:19:17.000 align:start position:0%
be wise if you don't read it all because
 
03:19:19.990 --> 03:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
uh we've got it here we can read it yeah
 
03:19:23.469 --> 03:19:23.479 align:start position:0%
okay anyway by either name the program
 
03:19:25.990 --> 03:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
authorized by RSA 94f doesn't merely
 
03:19:27.990 --> 03:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
allow state tax taxpayer funds to be
 
03:19:30.269 --> 03:19:30.279 align:start position:0%
used to support religious education that
 
03:19:33.189 --> 03:19:33.199 align:start position:0%
actively encourages it um the same could
 
03:19:35.309 --> 03:19:35.319 align:start position:0%
be said about the education tax credit
 
03:19:39.349 --> 03:19:39.359 align:start position:0%
program established by RSA um
 
03:19:42.830 --> 03:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
77g um this bill um this bill makes no
 
03:19:44.950 --> 03:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
changes to that program it's smaller
 
03:19:46.750 --> 03:19:46.760 align:start position:0%
more constrained and it's a voluntary
 
03:19:48.469 --> 03:19:48.479 align:start position:0%
tax credit which doesn't take money
 
03:19:50.269 --> 03:19:50.279 align:start position:0%
directly from the general or education
 
03:19:50.279 --> 03:19:52.389 align:start position:0%
directly from the general or education
funds

03:19:52.389 --> 03:19:52.399 align:start position:0%
funds
 
03:19:54.950 --> 03:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
and um as and this is something you all
 
03:19:57.110 --> 03:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
know but uh I'll state it for the record
 
03:19:59.870 --> 03:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
anyway both the EFA and Etc programs are
 
03:20:01.670 --> 03:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
ministered to the children's scholarship
 
03:20:03.590 --> 03:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
fund New Hampshire which is its name
 
03:20:05.469 --> 03:20:05.479 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding Incorporated in New York
 
03:20:07.229 --> 03:20:07.239 align:start position:0%
City rather than New Hampshire it does
 
03:20:10.110 --> 03:20:10.120 align:start position:0%
however have an office in conquer um out
 
03:20:12.910 --> 03:20:12.920 align:start position:0%
in Lowden Road interestingly on the uh
 
03:20:14.469 --> 03:20:14.479 align:start position:0%
Campus of a local church I'm not sure
 
03:20:15.550 --> 03:20:15.560 align:start position:0%
whether it's in the basement but
 
03:20:17.870 --> 03:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the property of the church
 
03:20:20.670 --> 03:20:20.680 align:start position:0%
and I was just wondering about csfs NH
 
03:20:21.950 --> 03:20:21.960 align:start position:0%
when it arrived here in Grand stage
 
03:20:23.830 --> 03:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
several years ago since it was and still
 
03:20:25.630 --> 03:20:25.640 align:start position:0%
is a small organization administering a
 
03:20:27.349 --> 03:20:27.359 align:start position:0%
very complicated entitlement program on
 
03:20:30.429 --> 03:20:30.439 align:start position:0%
a Cost Plus basis um I'm still dubious
 
03:20:32.750 --> 03:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
today especially the much larger much
 
03:20:34.630 --> 03:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
more ambitious EFA program has been
 
03:20:36.990 --> 03:20:37.000 align:start position:0%
added on top of the old Etc program and
 
03:20:39.030 --> 03:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
it could become even bigger than it is
 
03:20:41.349 --> 03:20:41.359 align:start position:0%
now depending what action is taken you
 
03:20:45.349 --> 03:20:45.359 align:start position:0%
know on other legislation so it its main
 
03:20:47.830 --> 03:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
mission is uh quite openly to support
 
03:20:49.990 --> 03:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
religious education which is fine you
 
03:20:51.349 --> 03:20:51.359 align:start position:0%
can look at their own public relations
 
03:20:53.269 --> 03:20:53.279 align:start position:0%
material it states very explicitly that
 
03:20:56.070 --> 03:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
they favor spending public money on
 
03:20:58.630 --> 03:20:58.640 align:start position:0%
religious education so I'm certainly I
 
03:21:01.110 --> 03:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
am not opposed to religious education
 
03:21:05.710 --> 03:21:05.720 align:start position:0%
but using taxpayer dollar support um
 
03:21:08.510 --> 03:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
such education is is a blatant violation
 
03:21:12.429 --> 03:21:12.439 align:start position:0%
of part first article six and it's um
 
03:21:14.349 --> 03:21:14.359 align:start position:0%
it's questionable under the federal
 
03:21:16.110 --> 03:21:16.120 align:start position:0%
Federal Constitution too so using
 
03:21:17.870 --> 03:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
taxpayer do for that purposes is also
 
03:21:21.229 --> 03:21:21.239 align:start position:0%
bad policy um to name to name just for
 
03:21:22.910 --> 03:21:22.920 align:start position:0%
many reasons name just one reason the
 
03:21:24.630 --> 03:21:24.640 align:start position:0%
EFA program gives the government the
 
03:21:26.229 --> 03:21:26.239 align:start position:0%
power to reward some religions which it
 
03:21:28.550 --> 03:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
approves of approves of while punishing
 
03:21:32.990 --> 03:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
others it disapproves of and um and I
 
03:21:35.269 --> 03:21:35.279 align:start position:0%
was in the legislature 2012 as you were
 
03:21:38.030 --> 03:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
Mr chair when Etc program was created as
 
03:21:40.790 --> 03:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
well as 2021 when the EFA was created
 
03:21:42.710 --> 03:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
and the scholarship organization written
 
03:21:45.150 --> 03:21:45.160 align:start position:0%
both programs and I believe this is
 
03:21:47.510 --> 03:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
pretty openly stated at the time with
 
03:21:49.189 --> 03:21:49.199 align:start position:0%
the expectation that it' be exempt from
 
03:21:50.389 --> 03:21:50.399 align:start position:0%
many of the state and federal
 
03:21:53.950 --> 03:21:53.960 align:start position:0%
regulations which an agency such as the
 
03:21:55.469 --> 03:21:55.479 align:start position:0%
state department of education is
 
03:21:58.510 --> 03:21:58.520 align:start position:0%
required to obey so I was
 
03:22:01.790 --> 03:22:01.800 align:start position:0%
um and uh I was not in the legislation
 
03:22:04.070 --> 03:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
1995 when the Charter Public School
 
03:22:06.910 --> 03:22:06.920 align:start position:0%
program is established with the laws uh
 
03:22:08.469 --> 03:22:08.479 align:start position:0%
company that program are pretty much the
 
03:22:10.790 --> 03:22:10.800 align:start position:0%
same over the last three decades and the
 
03:22:13.269 --> 03:22:13.279 align:start position:0%
chared school program explicitly
 
03:22:15.790 --> 03:22:15.800 align:start position:0%
excluded religious education which was
 
03:22:17.070 --> 03:22:17.080 align:start position:0%
um I think the right thing to do for
 
03:22:18.830 --> 03:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
constitutional practical and financial
 
03:22:23.030 --> 03:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
reasons So speaking of finances the EA's
 
03:22:25.710 --> 03:22:25.720 align:start position:0%
recent growth has been uh i prepar to
 
03:22:29.389 --> 03:22:29.399 align:start position:0%
describe it as out of control um HB 549
 
03:22:31.429 --> 03:22:31.439 align:start position:0%
in my opinion reduced the cost of the
 
03:22:33.550 --> 03:22:33.560 align:start position:0%
fir by a huge amount um certainly more
 
03:22:37.389 --> 03:22:37.399 align:start position:0%
than half and U and I know the fiscal
 
03:22:41.309 --> 03:22:41.319 align:start position:0%
note just says it's indeterminable um I
 
03:22:47.110 --> 03:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
and it's uh incomplete the but LBA uh
 
03:22:50.070 --> 03:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
the LBA um asked asked for a fiscal note
 
03:22:52.389 --> 03:22:52.399 align:start position:0%
worksheet um from the Department of
 
03:22:54.389 --> 03:22:54.399 align:start position:0%
Education they and they've not filled it
 
03:22:57.309 --> 03:22:57.319 align:start position:0%
out as far as I I checked I checked on
 
03:22:59.150 --> 03:22:59.160 align:start position:0%
the bill docket the most recent version
 
03:23:00.389 --> 03:23:00.399 align:start position:0%
of the bill do still not have the
 
03:23:02.910 --> 03:23:02.920 align:start position:0%
revised fiscal note so or the fiscal not
 
03:23:06.750 --> 03:23:06.760 align:start position:0%
if there FIS was revised um it was it's
 
03:23:08.790 --> 03:23:08.800 align:start position:0%
uh hard to figure out where to find it
 
03:23:10.950 --> 03:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
so um and they
 
03:23:14.590 --> 03:23:14.600 align:start position:0%
also they they did make a comment that
 
03:23:17.070 --> 03:23:17.080 align:start position:0%
they didn't know like uh to what extent
 
03:23:18.870 --> 03:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
EFA programs participants would remain
 
03:23:20.429 --> 03:23:20.439 align:start position:0%
in the program and just repurpose their
 
03:23:21.830 --> 03:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
available funding to comply with the
 
03:23:23.550 --> 03:23:23.560 align:start position:0%
changes in the bill so I would think
 
03:23:23.560 --> 03:23:25.349 align:start position:0%
changes in the bill so I would think
probably

03:23:25.349 --> 03:23:25.359 align:start position:0%
probably
 
03:23:28.349 --> 03:23:28.359 align:start position:0%
uh I think I think probably many of them
 
03:23:30.349 --> 03:23:30.359 align:start position:0%
many of them would but anyway
 
03:23:33.510 --> 03:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
so and um we had this bill last year and
 
03:23:35.630 --> 03:23:35.640 align:start position:0%
I analyzed the available data which is a
 
03:23:38.070 --> 03:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
couple years out of date um there's an
 
03:23:39.790 --> 03:23:39.800 align:start position:0%
article in December by the conquer
 
03:23:42.030 --> 03:23:42.040 align:start position:0%
Monitor jery margalus and that showed
 
03:23:44.750 --> 03:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
the vouch which um I'll say first of all
 
03:23:46.309 --> 03:23:46.319 align:start position:0%
his analysis was pretty similar to what
 
03:23:48.790 --> 03:23:48.800 align:start position:0%
I did in uh two years ago and I had a
 
03:23:51.870 --> 03:23:51.880 align:start position:0%
similar bill it's um and I double
 
03:23:54.950 --> 03:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
checked it myself and um he you know I
 
03:23:56.950 --> 03:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
think he basically got everything right
 
03:23:56.960 --> 03:23:58.389 align:start position:0%
think he basically got everything right
so

03:23:58.389 --> 03:23:58.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:24:01.910 --> 03:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
um anyway so his his article and I I
 
03:24:04.510 --> 03:24:04.520 align:start position:0%
sent around a copy the article it says
 
03:24:06.990 --> 03:24:07.000 align:start position:0%
there's a the program directly
 
03:24:10.790 --> 03:24:10.800 align:start position:0%
subsidizes 115 private schools 60 of
 
03:24:13.590 --> 03:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
which are religious schools uh 24 of the
 
03:24:16.750 --> 03:24:16.760 align:start position:0%
20 20 25 schools receiving those fund as
 
03:24:20.670 --> 03:24:20.680 align:start position:0%
of the 2023 Academic Year which for some
 
03:24:24.269 --> 03:24:24.279 align:start position:0%
reason the numbers for 2324 aren't
 
03:24:26.750 --> 03:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
available are explicitly religious
 
03:24:32.550 --> 03:24:32.560 align:start position:0%
including the top 10 and uh in 22 and 23
 
03:24:34.830 --> 03:24:34.840 align:start position:0%
private schools received 6.5 million
 
03:24:39.189 --> 03:24:39.199 align:start position:0%
religious schools got um 1 5.6 million
 
03:24:42.950 --> 03:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
and secular schools got only uh 900 well
 
03:24:47.309 --> 03:24:47.319 align:start position:0%
a little over 900,000 so that's uh 86
 
03:24:50.229 --> 03:24:50.239 align:start position:0%
86% went to religious schools 14% went
 
03:24:52.229 --> 03:24:52.239 align:start position:0%
to secular schools even though Private
 
03:24:54.189 --> 03:24:54.199 align:start position:0%
School enrollment is about equally
 
03:24:56.910 --> 03:24:56.920 align:start position:0%
divided between private and uh religious
 
03:24:59.830 --> 03:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
and secular schools and uh and that's
 
03:25:02.070 --> 03:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
out of the whole program which is 10.4
 
03:25:05.150 --> 03:25:05.160 align:start position:0%
million so the uh families who are
 
03:25:07.510 --> 03:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
paying for for other expenses uh some of
 
03:25:09.189 --> 03:25:09.199 align:start position:0%
which are related to Religious Education
 
03:25:13.550 --> 03:25:13.560 align:start position:0%
they only spend uh 3.9 million and
 
03:25:17.150 --> 03:25:17.160 align:start position:0%
uh those figures are all much higher in
 
03:25:20.670 --> 03:25:20.680 align:start position:0%
in in in this Academic Year and also for
 
03:25:22.750 --> 03:25:22.760 align:start position:0%
the previous one but they've not really
 
03:25:25.550 --> 03:25:25.560 align:start position:0%
released those detailed numbers so I
 
03:25:26.910 --> 03:25:26.920 align:start position:0%
would assume the I assume the
 
03:25:28.550 --> 03:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
percentages are
 
03:25:30.710 --> 03:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
probably um pretty much the same from
 
03:25:32.429 --> 03:25:32.439 align:start position:0%
from year to year and I think that
 
03:25:34.910 --> 03:25:34.920 align:start position:0%
certainly is a certain as a topic that
 
03:25:36.670 --> 03:25:36.680 align:start position:0%
might be approprate appropriate for a
 
03:25:39.070 --> 03:25:39.080 align:start position:0%
work session if you want to have one and
 
03:25:41.630 --> 03:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
um Andor you can leave that I assume
 
03:25:44.229 --> 03:25:44.239 align:start position:0%
this bill if if passed would go to
 
03:25:45.790 --> 03:25:45.800 align:start position:0%
finance as a second committee do you
 
03:25:49.830 --> 03:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
know that Mr chair or um okay I I don't
 
03:25:53.349 --> 03:25:53.359 align:start position:0%
know so um as I said I I think the the
 
03:25:55.469 --> 03:25:55.479 align:start position:0%
article I passed around that's uh that's
 
03:25:57.429 --> 03:25:57.439 align:start position:0%
that's accurate that's about about the
 
03:25:59.150 --> 03:25:59.160 align:start position:0%
same as what I would have come up if I
 
03:26:01.030 --> 03:26:01.040 align:start position:0%
went through the same available data on
 
03:26:05.150 --> 03:26:05.160 align:start position:0%
my own and um that 3.9 million the other
 
03:26:08.150 --> 03:26:08.160 align:start position:0%
dollars well two years ago 3.9 million
 
03:26:09.750 --> 03:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
um I think a lot of percentage of those
 
03:26:11.309 --> 03:26:11.319 align:start position:0%
bucks are also being spent on other
 
03:26:13.030 --> 03:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
forms of religious education so that's
 
03:26:15.750 --> 03:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
the main main most controversial thing
 
03:26:17.389 --> 03:26:17.399 align:start position:0%
although it's less controversial than I
 
03:26:19.990 --> 03:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
thought because nobody's here
 
03:26:23.870 --> 03:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
but um although the committee is mostly
 
03:26:26.670 --> 03:26:26.680 align:start position:0%
here so that's good there um there's two
 
03:26:28.189 --> 03:26:28.199 align:start position:0%
other issues which are not directly
 
03:26:29.269 --> 03:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
related to the issue of funding
 
03:26:31.550 --> 03:26:31.560 align:start position:0%
religious education section one
 
03:26:33.630 --> 03:26:33.640 align:start position:0%
stipulates the higher education
 
03:26:35.790 --> 03:26:35.800 align:start position:0%
institutions receiving EFA funds would
 
03:26:38.269 --> 03:26:38.279 align:start position:0%
have to be accredited and um
 
03:26:41.990 --> 03:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
I when I L at the 2223 numbers I
 
03:26:43.510 --> 03:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
couldn't actually find any non-
 
03:26:46.309 --> 03:26:46.319 align:start position:0%
accredited higher education institutions
 
03:26:47.790 --> 03:26:47.800 align:start position:0%
but uh if there are any they're no
 
03:26:49.990 --> 03:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
longer eligible for the
 
03:26:52.550 --> 03:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
program and also section three takes out
 
03:26:54.349 --> 03:26:54.359 align:start position:0%
special legal protections which are
 
03:26:56.269 --> 03:26:56.279 align:start position:0%
granted to EFA recipients and to the
 
03:26:58.990 --> 03:26:59.000 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization itself um
 
03:27:00.870 --> 03:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
henceforth if this bill passes when you
 
03:27:02.830 --> 03:27:02.840 align:start position:0%
use the EFA program to violate the law
 
03:27:04.750 --> 03:27:04.760 align:start position:0%
or to violate anyone else's Constitution
 
03:27:07.070 --> 03:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
or common law rights you could be held
 
03:27:09.229 --> 03:27:09.239 align:start position:0%
liable just like anyone else who misuses
 
03:27:12.590 --> 03:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers money so I've covered so
 
03:27:14.429 --> 03:27:14.439 align:start position:0%
that's my written testimony which all of
 
03:27:16.309 --> 03:27:16.319 align:start position:0%
you have probably read by now and I also
 
03:27:19.550 --> 03:27:19.560 align:start position:0%
say as also reiterate again um this is
 
03:27:21.229 --> 03:27:21.239 align:start position:0%
already one of the larger entitlement
 
03:27:23.030 --> 03:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
programs in the state if the bill we
 
03:27:27.110 --> 03:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
heard two weeks ago or or seem like or
 
03:27:30.590 --> 03:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
whenever that was but re fairly recently
 
03:27:32.309 --> 03:27:32.319 align:start position:0%
which I testified on if that passes that
 
03:27:34.710 --> 03:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
would probably become the second largest
 
03:27:36.429 --> 03:27:36.439 align:start position:0%
entitlement program in the whole state
 
03:27:40.349 --> 03:27:40.359 align:start position:0%
aside from uh aside from snap for food
 
03:27:42.710 --> 03:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
stamps and food stamps has a very robust
 
03:27:44.309 --> 03:27:44.319 align:start position:0%
administrative structure around it
 
03:27:46.630 --> 03:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
there's a both
 
03:27:48.229 --> 03:27:48.239 align:start position:0%
Department of Human Health and Human
 
03:27:49.590 --> 03:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
Services the Federal Department of
 
03:27:51.590 --> 03:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
Agriculture like have a lot of people
 
03:27:53.990 --> 03:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
overseeing it they've got a you know got
 
03:27:57.189 --> 03:27:57.199 align:start position:0%
very detailed rules um this this program
 
03:27:58.910 --> 03:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
um it's
 
03:28:01.070 --> 03:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
getting the way it's structured gives
 
03:28:03.150 --> 03:28:03.160 align:start position:0%
very the doe very little power over or
 
03:28:04.870 --> 03:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
any other state agency and then the doe
 
03:28:07.189 --> 03:28:07.199 align:start position:0%
in my opinion has not necessarily been
 
03:28:08.710 --> 03:28:08.720 align:start position:0%
very aggressive and even using what
 
03:28:12.670 --> 03:28:12.680 align:start position:0%
power we power it has and there's um
 
03:28:15.070 --> 03:28:15.080 align:start position:0%
there's also the issue of uh it's can't
 
03:28:17.429 --> 03:28:17.439 align:start position:0%
really it's hard to audit and what
 
03:28:18.870 --> 03:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
there's a very limited audit and that
 
03:28:20.990 --> 03:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
found an alarmingly high percentage of
 
03:28:22.790 --> 03:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
incorrect you know incorrect
 
03:28:26.229 --> 03:28:26.239 align:start position:0%
transactions and I'm not I'm not
 
03:28:27.630 --> 03:28:27.640 align:start position:0%
integrating the Integrity of the
 
03:28:28.910 --> 03:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
children's scholarship fund New
 
03:28:30.309 --> 03:28:30.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but it's a it's a small
 
03:28:32.590 --> 03:28:32.600 align:start position:0%
organization it's very it's um not
 
03:28:34.670 --> 03:28:34.680 align:start position:0%
really there very few people who
 
03:28:36.950 --> 03:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
experience in compliance like in
 
03:28:38.750 --> 03:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
administering entitlement programs so
 
03:28:41.670 --> 03:28:41.680 align:start position:0%
it's primarily it's focuses on on on
 
03:28:44.469 --> 03:28:44.479 align:start position:0%
other issues so turning a large program
 
03:28:46.269 --> 03:28:46.279 align:start position:0%
like that over to an organization like
 
03:28:48.950 --> 03:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
that is fairly risky and I assume if the
 
03:28:51.389 --> 03:28:51.399 align:start position:0%
I'm going to guess not that Crystal Ball
 
03:28:53.189 --> 03:28:53.199 align:start position:0%
but uh if this program continues in the
 
03:28:55.510 --> 03:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
future probably there will be more
 
03:28:57.790 --> 03:28:57.800 align:start position:0%
administrative uh oversight of it just
 
03:29:00.110 --> 03:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
because there's a there's a lot of money
 
03:29:01.870 --> 03:29:01.880 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of ways to abute anytime
 
03:29:03.309 --> 03:29:03.319 align:start position:0%
the government hands out money as it
 
03:29:04.950 --> 03:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
doing here there's lots of ways to abuse
 
03:29:07.189 --> 03:29:07.199 align:start position:0%
it and uh people will find them so
 
03:29:09.269 --> 03:29:09.279 align:start position:0%
that's my uh that's my testimony here
 
03:29:10.950 --> 03:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to take any questions
 
03:29:12.150 --> 03:29:12.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
03:29:13.830 --> 03:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
03:29:17.389 --> 03:29:17.399 align:start position:0%
committee representative fellows
 
03:29:20.229 --> 03:29:20.239 align:start position:0%
thank you um this is enlightening um I'm
 
03:29:24.910 --> 03:29:24.920 align:start position:0%
looking at the the monitor article and
 
03:29:27.590 --> 03:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
with the list of the religious schools
 
03:29:29.630 --> 03:29:29.640 align:start position:0%
where the funding goes and then I also
 
03:29:31.790 --> 03:29:31.800 align:start position:0%
see that somebody connected with the
 
03:29:36.030 --> 03:29:36.040 align:start position:0%
voucher program says that kids attending
 
03:29:36.040 --> 03:29:36.910 align:start position:0%
voucher program says that kids attending
those

03:29:36.910 --> 03:29:36.920 align:start position:0%
those
 
03:29:40.070 --> 03:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
schools um they're not necessarily
 
03:29:42.910 --> 03:29:42.920 align:start position:0%
looking for the religious part of the of
 
03:29:46.830 --> 03:29:46.840 align:start position:0%
the um curriculum but they looking for
 
03:29:49.070 --> 03:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
more traditional
 
03:29:51.349 --> 03:29:51.359 align:start position:0%
experiences and then the other day when
 
03:29:53.349 --> 03:29:53.359 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony on the voucher Bill
 
03:29:57.670 --> 03:29:57.680 align:start position:0%
we heard about um schools that were more
 
03:30:01.429 --> 03:30:01.439 align:start position:0%
in line with their family values um do
 
03:30:05.229 --> 03:30:05.239 align:start position:0%
you have any thoughts on what that well
 
03:30:05.239 --> 03:30:06.150 align:start position:0%
you have any thoughts on what that well
I

03:30:06.150 --> 03:30:06.160 align:start position:0%
I
 
03:30:08.429 --> 03:30:08.439 align:start position:0%
think if you go to if you go to a
 
03:30:10.950 --> 03:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
religious religious school um you're you
 
03:30:13.229 --> 03:30:13.239 align:start position:0%
know you're going to learn about the the
 
03:30:14.870 --> 03:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
religion I myself spent the last two
 
03:30:17.349 --> 03:30:17.359 align:start position:0%
years of my high school career at a uh
 
03:30:19.150 --> 03:30:19.160 align:start position:0%
the Northville M Herman school which is
 
03:30:20.590 --> 03:30:20.600 align:start position:0%
uh in Massachusetts although it's right
 
03:30:22.229 --> 03:30:22.239 align:start position:0%
on the state line but it's still in that
 
03:30:26.150 --> 03:30:26.160 align:start position:0%
other state and uh but um you know they
 
03:30:28.550 --> 03:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
they had students of of like all faith
 
03:30:31.229 --> 03:30:31.239 align:start position:0%
my parents were not uh they're brought
 
03:30:33.670 --> 03:30:33.680 align:start position:0%
up brought of as my father's a Roman
 
03:30:35.349 --> 03:30:35.359 align:start position:0%
Catholic and my mother's Episcopalian
 
03:30:37.189 --> 03:30:37.199 align:start position:0%
they're not particularly religious
 
03:30:38.630 --> 03:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
people but they sent me there and I you
 
03:30:41.630 --> 03:30:41.640 align:start position:0%
know I I absorbed a lot of it although
 
03:30:43.269 --> 03:30:43.279 align:start position:0%
it still turned out the way I did so
 
03:30:44.750 --> 03:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
that I think anytime you send some to
 
03:30:47.070 --> 03:30:47.080 align:start position:0%
Religious Education regards what the
 
03:30:49.150 --> 03:30:49.160 align:start position:0%
parents motivation is the kids children
 
03:30:51.389 --> 03:30:51.399 align:start position:0%
are going to uh learn what they're being
 
03:30:52.510 --> 03:30:52.520 align:start position:0%
children going to learn learn what
 
03:30:57.510 --> 03:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
they're being taught um and and uh the
 
03:31:00.030 --> 03:31:00.040 align:start position:0%
AL like the family values um I mean
 
03:31:02.910 --> 03:31:02.920 align:start position:0%
guess uh I mean I think our Public
 
03:31:04.910 --> 03:31:04.920 align:start position:0%
Schools do respect Family Values
 
03:31:06.349 --> 03:31:06.359 align:start position:0%
everybody's a different opinion about
 
03:31:10.030 --> 03:31:10.040 align:start position:0%
family values is and also so sometimes a
 
03:31:12.630 --> 03:31:12.640 align:start position:0%
lot of the um comments I heard in
 
03:31:14.590 --> 03:31:14.600 align:start position:0%
support of like expanding the program we
 
03:31:16.309 --> 03:31:16.319 align:start position:0%
were and maybe that's it's a good thing
 
03:31:17.870 --> 03:31:17.880 align:start position:0%
May it's a bad thing we're definitely
 
03:31:21.750 --> 03:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
many cases uh a subsidizing sort of
 
03:31:23.429 --> 03:31:23.439 align:start position:0%
lifestyle decisions that families make
 
03:31:24.790 --> 03:31:24.800 align:start position:0%
about how they're going to live which
 
03:31:27.670 --> 03:31:27.680 align:start position:0%
often involves uh one parent or
 
03:31:30.309 --> 03:31:30.319 align:start position:0%
sometimes both um with especially when
 
03:31:31.710 --> 03:31:31.720 align:start position:0%
your homeschooling sometimes involes one
 
03:31:33.590 --> 03:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
parent kind of withdrawing from uh the
 
03:31:36.870 --> 03:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
conventional Workforce and uh you know
 
03:31:38.590 --> 03:31:38.600 align:start position:0%
devoting their devoted time to
 
03:31:40.389 --> 03:31:40.399 align:start position:0%
homeschooling the kids which is fine and
 
03:31:41.710 --> 03:31:41.720 align:start position:0%
actually this pill doesn't really
 
03:31:45.429 --> 03:31:45.439 align:start position:0%
directly affect homeschoolers so but um
 
03:31:47.750 --> 03:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean everybody you know every
 
03:31:49.429 --> 03:31:49.439 align:start position:0%
family every family has values
 
03:31:50.870 --> 03:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
regardless of what type of school
 
03:31:52.229 --> 03:31:52.239 align:start position:0%
they're going to they're going the
 
03:31:54.670 --> 03:31:54.680 align:start position:0%
children are going to absorb it and even
 
03:31:56.870 --> 03:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
even if it's a very you know even if
 
03:31:58.510 --> 03:31:58.520 align:start position:0%
you're very liberal family you'll learn
 
03:31:59.910 --> 03:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
about traditional stuff you very
 
03:32:01.030 --> 03:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
traditional family you know they'll
 
03:32:03.429 --> 03:32:03.439 align:start position:0%
learn about stuff outside the family so
 
03:32:06.630 --> 03:32:06.640 align:start position:0%
um I I I feel like ass with the state
 
03:32:09.309 --> 03:32:09.319 align:start position:0%
budget crisis we should be very careful
 
03:32:10.830 --> 03:32:10.840 align:start position:0%
about what we're subsidizing or State
 
03:32:12.429 --> 03:32:12.439 align:start position:0%
dollars in some cases I think we're
 
03:32:16.389 --> 03:32:16.399 align:start position:0%
subsidizing uh subsidizing Act ities
 
03:32:19.670 --> 03:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
that may not need the subsidy um
 
03:32:24.150 --> 03:32:24.160 align:start position:0%
and R SES do you have a question yeah um
 
03:32:26.309 --> 03:32:26.319 align:start position:0%
first first a question to you if you
 
03:32:30.150 --> 03:32:30.160 align:start position:0%
don't mind um and that is do you have
 
03:32:33.030 --> 03:32:33.040 align:start position:0%
any other pink cards or is anybody else
 
03:32:35.670 --> 03:32:35.680 align:start position:0%
testifying no I I don't have any other
 
03:32:39.189 --> 03:32:39.199 align:start position:0%
pink cards up here okay
 
03:32:42.309 --> 03:32:42.319 align:start position:0%
so I'll ask a couple of questions the
 
03:32:46.349 --> 03:32:46.359 align:start position:0%
one witness we have um but um I really
 
03:32:47.830 --> 03:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
think it's important this is an
 
03:32:50.790 --> 03:32:50.800 align:start position:0%
important issue that we at least hear
 
03:32:54.189 --> 03:32:54.199 align:start position:0%
from the children's scholarship fund and
 
03:32:59.349 --> 03:32:59.359 align:start position:0%
also uh from the uh uh the what is it
 
03:33:03.790 --> 03:33:03.800 align:start position:0%
LBA yeah uh uh regarding the audit and
 
03:33:06.389 --> 03:33:06.399 align:start position:0%
uh also that we hear from the Department
 
03:33:10.790 --> 03:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
of Education on uh how on the logistics
 
03:33:13.630 --> 03:33:13.640 align:start position:0%
the actual way in which these vouchers
 
03:33:18.229 --> 03:33:18.239 align:start position:0%
are processed um and what role the uh
 
03:33:20.710 --> 03:33:20.720 align:start position:0%
Department plays in the processing and
 
03:33:23.750 --> 03:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
what role the uh and approval I should
 
03:33:26.870 --> 03:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
say and uh what role the scholarship
 
03:33:30.189 --> 03:33:30.199 align:start position:0%
fund plays and what role the parents
 
03:33:32.389 --> 03:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
play you know getting getting all the
 
03:33:34.389 --> 03:33:34.399 align:start position:0%
dimensions of this out on the table so
 
03:33:36.229 --> 03:33:36.239 align:start position:0%
that we can make a reasonable judgment
 
03:33:40.510 --> 03:33:40.520 align:start position:0%
on this proposal um so I hope we will I
 
03:33:44.429 --> 03:33:44.439 align:start position:0%
will just say I I hope we will have uh a
 
03:33:48.630 --> 03:33:48.640 align:start position:0%
uh opportunity to work on this in a in a
 
03:33:52.590 --> 03:33:52.600 align:start position:0%
session after we finish this hearing um
 
03:33:54.710 --> 03:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
which is uh limited by the number of
 
03:33:58.030 --> 03:33:58.040 align:start position:0%
people we have before us uh so well let
 
03:34:00.070 --> 03:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
me quickly respond to that we had a
 
03:34:02.950 --> 03:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
hearing for 115 which started at 1:00 we
 
03:34:05.590 --> 03:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
completed around 6 o' in the afternoon
 
03:34:07.189 --> 03:34:07.199 align:start position:0%
so we had a 5H hour
 
03:34:10.429 --> 03:34:10.439 align:start position:0%
hearing and the balance of cards that
 
03:34:13.189 --> 03:34:13.199 align:start position:0%
came in not those which were done
 
03:34:14.670 --> 03:34:14.680 align:start position:0%
through the portal but the cards came in
 
03:34:16.550 --> 03:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
was pretty even
 
03:34:20.110 --> 03:34:20.120 align:start position:0%
and what we we heard from one side is
 
03:34:23.229 --> 03:34:23.239 align:start position:0%
the is the position that uh I believe
 
03:34:26.070 --> 03:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
represent Horgan is coming from and then
 
03:34:27.550 --> 03:34:27.560 align:start position:0%
the other side was
 
03:34:31.349 --> 03:34:31.359 align:start position:0%
saying this bill specifically is
 
03:34:33.710 --> 03:34:33.720 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional the courts have already
 
03:34:37.309 --> 03:34:37.319 align:start position:0%
declared that public money can be used
 
03:34:40.630 --> 03:34:40.640 align:start position:0%
for uh private education including
 
03:34:43.150 --> 03:34:43.160 align:start position:0%
religious education and if we disallow
 
03:34:44.309 --> 03:34:44.319 align:start position:0%
that it's
 
03:34:46.990 --> 03:34:47.000 align:start position:0%
discrimination so uh there are two
 
03:34:50.150 --> 03:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
diametrically opposed positions on this
 
03:34:54.349 --> 03:34:54.359 align:start position:0%
um so I I think that after a 5our
 
03:34:57.510 --> 03:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
conversation of hearing and hearing and
 
03:35:00.150 --> 03:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
hearing you I I think it's time for us
 
03:35:01.670 --> 03:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
eventually we're getting very close to
 
03:35:03.269 --> 03:35:03.279 align:start position:0%
having to make a decision where we're
 
03:35:05.950 --> 03:35:05.960 align:start position:0%
going to go on this bill uh in terms of
 
03:35:08.469 --> 03:35:08.479 align:start position:0%
today uh I don't see anybody else here
 
03:35:10.750 --> 03:35:10.760 align:start position:0%
because it's a specific Bill dealing
 
03:35:12.750 --> 03:35:12.760 align:start position:0%
about these money's being used for
 
03:35:12.760 --> 03:35:14.389 align:start position:0%
about these money's being used for
Religious

03:35:14.389 --> 03:35:14.399 align:start position:0%
Religious
 
03:35:17.469 --> 03:35:17.479 align:start position:0%
Education and with that I think was
 
03:35:20.590 --> 03:35:20.600 align:start position:0%
pretty well identified by those that
 
03:35:22.870 --> 03:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
came in saying no it's not
 
03:35:24.630 --> 03:35:24.640 align:start position:0%
constitutional that we went through that
 
03:35:26.790 --> 03:35:26.800 align:start position:0%
hp15 I don't think it's necessary to go
 
03:35:28.110 --> 03:35:28.120 align:start position:0%
through it again
 
03:35:31.710 --> 03:35:31.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:36.870 --> 03:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
representative I but no I I don't know
 
03:35:38.510 --> 03:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
how to actually well I'm just gonna say
 
03:35:40.110 --> 03:35:40.120 align:start position:0%
it but we have not heard from the
 
03:35:43.590 --> 03:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
children's scholarship fund about this
 
03:35:47.510 --> 03:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
yet have we they weren't here the so is
 
03:35:49.830 --> 03:35:49.840 align:start position:0%
that something that we should like when
 
03:35:52.429 --> 03:35:52.439 align:start position:0%
we have a work session or I mean I
 
03:35:54.309 --> 03:35:54.319 align:start position:0%
assume we have a work session that don't
 
03:35:56.349 --> 03:35:56.359 align:start position:0%
forget this is my first year so I'm a
 
03:35:56.359 --> 03:35:57.110 align:start position:0%
forget this is my first year so I'm a
little

03:35:57.110 --> 03:35:57.120 align:start position:0%
little
 
03:36:02.670 --> 03:36:02.680 align:start position:0%
bit um I don't know lost maybe but when
 
03:36:04.150 --> 03:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
we have a work
 
03:36:06.229 --> 03:36:06.239 align:start position:0%
session is that the kind of thing that
 
03:36:07.710 --> 03:36:07.720 align:start position:0%
we would have in the work session like
 
03:36:09.429 --> 03:36:09.439 align:start position:0%
would we hear from would we be able to
 
03:36:11.630 --> 03:36:11.640 align:start position:0%
question the children's scholarship fund
 
03:36:14.670 --> 03:36:14.680 align:start position:0%
would we be able to question like the
 
03:36:14.680 --> 03:36:16.349 align:start position:0%
would we be able to question like the
DOE

03:36:16.349 --> 03:36:16.359 align:start position:0%
DOE
 
03:36:21.070 --> 03:36:21.080 align:start position:0%
about oversight and all that stuff I so
 
03:36:23.990 --> 03:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
we do have an oversight committee for
 
03:36:27.070 --> 03:36:27.080 align:start position:0%
this purpose the EFA oversight committee
 
03:36:30.150 --> 03:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
they issued a report this last year and
 
03:36:33.469 --> 03:36:33.479 align:start position:0%
well recently for the last year and they
 
03:36:36.070 --> 03:36:36.080 align:start position:0%
went through and looked at all the
 
03:36:39.870 --> 03:36:39.880 align:start position:0%
reports the audits the the information
 
03:36:43.150 --> 03:36:43.160 align:start position:0%
regarding the how funds are being used
 
03:36:45.990 --> 03:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh for for what types of activities
 
03:36:49.229 --> 03:36:49.239 align:start position:0%
whether it be books or tutoring Etc uh
 
03:36:51.469 --> 03:36:51.479 align:start position:0%
we went through and looked at the report
 
03:36:54.550 --> 03:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
which identified some of the the errors
 
03:36:57.349 --> 03:36:57.359 align:start position:0%
which had be made regard for example the
 
03:37:00.229 --> 03:37:00.239 align:start position:0%
net gross income net income versus gross
 
03:37:02.950 --> 03:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
income uh which have all been taken care
 
03:37:08.309 --> 03:37:08.319 align:start position:0%
of uh so there this has been done in the
 
03:37:11.550 --> 03:37:11.560 align:start position:0%
scholarship uh children's scholarship uh
 
03:37:12.990 --> 03:37:13.000 align:start position:0%
uh fund
 
03:37:15.750 --> 03:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
organization has testified on this this
 
03:37:20.950 --> 03:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
before the Committees before um I not in
 
03:37:23.110 --> 03:37:23.120 align:start position:0%
this committee no not in this committee
 
03:37:28.389 --> 03:37:28.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:32.469 --> 03:37:32.479 align:start position:0%
hb15 sorry so you mean when through
 
03:37:36.269 --> 03:37:36.279 align:start position:0%
folks there so I didn't the children's
 
03:37:38.110 --> 03:37:38.120 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund was here
 
03:37:42.389 --> 03:37:42.399 align:start position:0%
on last week I don't think that
 
03:37:45.990 --> 03:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
happened no K Baker did not test but
 
03:37:47.790 --> 03:37:47.800 align:start position:0%
true folks that were
 
03:37:50.389 --> 03:37:50.399 align:start position:0%
attending that that or you know the
 
03:37:53.030 --> 03:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
thefa program they did
 
03:37:55.510 --> 03:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
testify so you know whether we have a
 
03:37:56.870 --> 03:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
work session or not I'm going to have to
 
03:38:02.590 --> 03:38:02.600 align:start position:0%
decide that um um it's it's one where um
 
03:38:03.950 --> 03:38:03.960 align:start position:0%
quite truthfully I know where the vote's
 
03:38:04.990 --> 03:38:05.000 align:start position:0%
going on
 
03:38:08.110 --> 03:38:08.120 align:start position:0%
this and I think you do
 
03:38:11.429 --> 03:38:11.439 align:start position:0%
too and and when I have to prioritize
 
03:38:12.750 --> 03:38:12.760 align:start position:0%
where and how we're going to be using
 
03:38:16.150 --> 03:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
our time here
 
03:38:17.830 --> 03:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
I I believe we have some other very
 
03:38:19.189 --> 03:38:19.199 align:start position:0%
critical issues which going to have to
 
03:38:22.830 --> 03:38:22.840 align:start position:0%
develop a lot of time too and so um I'm
 
03:38:24.950 --> 03:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
not going to say yay or nay on on the
 
03:38:27.429 --> 03:38:27.439 align:start position:0%
work session on that a lot of the
 
03:38:31.070 --> 03:38:31.080 align:start position:0%
bills uh we don't do work sessions on
 
03:38:33.510 --> 03:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
and so if you are desirous of gaining
 
03:38:35.269 --> 03:38:35.279 align:start position:0%
some information from them you're more
 
03:38:39.950 --> 03:38:39.960 align:start position:0%
than welcome to contact them to get the
 
03:38:44.030 --> 03:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
information any other questions for
 
03:38:46.429 --> 03:38:46.439 align:start position:0%
represent thank you Mr Mr chairman and
 
03:38:47.870 --> 03:38:47.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
03:38:50.550 --> 03:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
question so you made a point here um
 
03:38:53.870 --> 03:38:53.880 align:start position:0%
from this conquer monitor article that a
 
03:38:57.630 --> 03:38:57.640 align:start position:0%
lot of a lot of money goes to religious
 
03:39:01.150 --> 03:39:01.160 align:start position:0%
schools and um is it possible that the
 
03:39:05.110 --> 03:39:05.120 align:start position:0%
reason for that is that the EFA program
 
03:39:09.030 --> 03:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
is limited to parents of modest means
 
03:39:11.670 --> 03:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
and that the schools that are available
 
03:39:14.349 --> 03:39:14.359 align:start position:0%
in the state that are accessible to
 
03:39:17.670 --> 03:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
people of modest means tend to be
 
03:39:20.030 --> 03:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
religious um I think there's a lot more
 
03:39:23.590 --> 03:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
to it than that um which I spoke um I
 
03:39:25.950 --> 03:39:25.960 align:start position:0%
didn't I wasn't I didn't speak to I
 
03:39:28.309 --> 03:39:28.319 align:start position:0%
spoke to like several of uh the schools
 
03:39:30.910 --> 03:39:30.920 align:start position:0%
that uh receive funds although only one
 
03:39:34.030 --> 03:39:34.040 align:start position:0%
of which was a uh Roman Catholic School
 
03:39:35.590 --> 03:39:35.600 align:start position:0%
which was explicitly religious was the
 
03:39:36.990 --> 03:39:37.000 align:start position:0%
Roman Catholic School actually a
 
03:39:39.189 --> 03:39:39.199 align:start position:0%
boarding school located in Pennsylvania
 
03:39:42.070 --> 03:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
which um and but what what I heard from
 
03:39:44.070 --> 03:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
officials at all three institutions is
 
03:39:46.349 --> 03:39:46.359 align:start position:0%
that they try as much as POS well some
 
03:39:49.070 --> 03:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
of them have explicitly need blind um
 
03:39:52.070 --> 03:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
need blind uh admissions policies like I
 
03:39:54.269 --> 03:39:54.279 align:start position:0%
talked to some who actually very or you
 
03:39:55.870 --> 03:39:55.880 align:start position:0%
say very one of them has a very large
 
03:39:58.590 --> 03:39:58.600 align:start position:0%
endowment probably bigger richer than
 
03:40:00.150 --> 03:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
most colleges and three other
 
03:40:02.590 --> 03:40:02.600 align:start position:0%
institutions are two other secular
 
03:40:03.910 --> 03:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
institutions here in New Hampshire were
 
03:40:05.910 --> 03:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
somewhat smaller but they told me they
 
03:40:09.550 --> 03:40:09.560 align:start position:0%
they they work first by identifying the
 
03:40:12.389 --> 03:40:12.399 align:start position:0%
students who apply who they think are
 
03:40:13.910 --> 03:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
good fit for the program and of course
 
03:40:16.630 --> 03:40:16.640 align:start position:0%
that's problematic to to because this
 
03:40:18.229 --> 03:40:18.239 align:start position:0%
these schools
 
03:40:20.710 --> 03:40:20.720 align:start position:0%
usually don't they have some special
 
03:40:22.469 --> 03:40:22.479 align:start position:0%
need students but they don't you know do
 
03:40:24.150 --> 03:40:24.160 align:start position:0%
the very difficult special needs cases
 
03:40:25.870 --> 03:40:25.880 align:start position:0%
and actually the religious school that
 
03:40:28.229 --> 03:40:28.239 align:start position:0%
was out of state explicitly said they
 
03:40:30.110 --> 03:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
don't want anybody who any learning
 
03:40:32.110 --> 03:40:32.120 align:start position:0%
disabilities at the program was only for
 
03:40:35.429 --> 03:40:35.439 align:start position:0%
it was only for boys too but um they
 
03:40:37.229 --> 03:40:37.239 align:start position:0%
they explicitly that they need a certain
 
03:40:39.030 --> 03:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
type of young man for this program and
 
03:40:41.110 --> 03:40:41.120 align:start position:0%
that was fine I mean that it was seemed
 
03:40:42.710 --> 03:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
like a good program for a certain type
 
03:40:46.269 --> 03:40:46.279 align:start position:0%
of young young man but they all they all
 
03:40:48.510 --> 03:40:48.520 align:start position:0%
to lesser greater or lesser extent have
 
03:40:50.309 --> 03:40:50.319 align:start position:0%
uh endowments they have other sources of
 
03:40:54.070 --> 03:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
funding they um solicit um solicit
 
03:40:56.110 --> 03:40:56.120 align:start position:0%
donations they basically most of them so
 
03:40:58.469 --> 03:40:58.479 align:start position:0%
the way they typically operated they
 
03:41:00.110 --> 03:41:00.120 align:start position:0%
find a student who's interested and then
 
03:41:01.990 --> 03:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
they find a way for the family to afford
 
03:41:05.429 --> 03:41:05.439 align:start position:0%
it so this is uh at the EFA at least the
 
03:41:06.550 --> 03:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
way the especially at least way the
 
03:41:08.150 --> 03:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
secular schools the way it works that's
 
03:41:09.990 --> 03:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
one of the sources of funding so
 
03:41:12.269 --> 03:41:12.279 align:start position:0%
somebody I mean they know who's a modest
 
03:41:15.030 --> 03:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
means and who isn't but they they they
 
03:41:16.910 --> 03:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
they find they find the family and then
 
03:41:18.389 --> 03:41:18.399 align:start position:0%
they figure how the family can pay for
 
03:41:19.590 --> 03:41:19.600 align:start position:0%
it and sometimes it's out of the
 
03:41:21.309 --> 03:41:21.319 align:start position:0%
school's own endowment sometimes it's
 
03:41:24.469 --> 03:41:24.479 align:start position:0%
out of loans you know sometimes it's if
 
03:41:26.309 --> 03:41:26.319 align:start position:0%
they're lucky the family's own funds
 
03:41:28.149 --> 03:41:28.159 align:start position:0%
fact you a really wealthy family they'll
 
03:41:30.429 --> 03:41:30.439 align:start position:0%
try to get you for more donations on top
 
03:41:32.070 --> 03:41:32.080 align:start position:0%
of tuition but it's a familiesal funds
 
03:41:35.550 --> 03:41:35.560 align:start position:0%
and then the EA voucher is uh if it's
 
03:41:36.990 --> 03:41:37.000 align:start position:0%
available is one of the other things
 
03:41:39.590 --> 03:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
that goes into the mix so I think um
 
03:41:41.070 --> 03:41:41.080 align:start position:0%
think a lot of the spending both of the
 
03:41:43.269 --> 03:41:43.279 align:start position:0%
second religious schools is displacing
 
03:41:44.990 --> 03:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
spending that otherwise would have come
 
03:41:47.349 --> 03:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
from the the private sector you know so
 
03:41:50.349 --> 03:41:50.359 align:start position:0%
that's uh and so that's why I think this
 
03:41:53.189 --> 03:41:53.199 align:start position:0%
bill is I think why I think my bill is
 
03:41:55.710 --> 03:41:55.720 align:start position:0%
is is uh is good policy not you know
 
03:41:57.710 --> 03:41:57.720 align:start position:0%
especially with the budget crisis we're
 
03:42:00.309 --> 03:42:00.319 align:start position:0%
having this year so that's U it's along
 
03:42:02.229 --> 03:42:02.239 align:start position:0%
with the answer I think there's more to
 
03:42:04.670 --> 03:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
it than that it's not just because uh
 
03:42:07.229 --> 03:42:07.239 align:start position:0%
the um especially the Roman Catholic
 
03:42:09.389 --> 03:42:09.399 align:start position:0%
parochial schools charge lower tuition
 
03:42:12.429 --> 03:42:12.439 align:start position:0%
than most other private institutions
 
03:42:16.429 --> 03:42:16.439 align:start position:0%
thanks forther questions yes
 
03:42:18.870 --> 03:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
uh you mentioned that they don't um
 
03:42:21.590 --> 03:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
receive special students is it possible
 
03:42:23.830 --> 03:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
that they just don't have the budget to
 
03:42:25.790 --> 03:42:25.800 align:start position:0%
receive special ed students because they
 
03:42:27.910 --> 03:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
don't receive any state funding for
 
03:42:32.349 --> 03:42:32.359 align:start position:0%
those special ed students um that's uh I
 
03:42:35.149 --> 03:42:35.159 align:start position:0%
mean the uh well that's probably that's
 
03:42:36.670 --> 03:42:36.680 align:start position:0%
probably true that might be another
 
03:42:38.550 --> 03:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
topic you discuss at a work session it's
 
03:42:40.389 --> 03:42:40.399 align:start position:0%
based on the adequacy funding which does
 
03:42:42.950 --> 03:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
give you a little bit more funding for
 
03:42:44.550 --> 03:42:44.560 align:start position:0%
the special education students but
 
03:42:46.550 --> 03:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
that's uh know that's a question
 
03:42:48.189 --> 03:42:48.199 align:start position:0%
probably that somebody else can answer
 
03:42:50.349 --> 03:42:50.359 align:start position:0%
but you know there are there definitely
 
03:42:51.590 --> 03:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
are some of these institutions who
 
03:42:53.870 --> 03:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
explicitly exclude uh special needs
 
03:42:56.710 --> 03:42:56.720 align:start position:0%
students and they're all and of course
 
03:42:59.189 --> 03:42:59.199 align:start position:0%
they all probably best suited for you
 
03:43:02.870 --> 03:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
know children of who's with supportive
 
03:43:06.429 --> 03:43:06.439 align:start position:0%
families and who have like a maybe uh at
 
03:43:08.870 --> 03:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
least like a good work work work ethic
 
03:43:11.110 --> 03:43:11.120 align:start position:0%
and higher intelligence and the kids who
 
03:43:13.269 --> 03:43:13.279 align:start position:0%
don't get admitted who have to go to
 
03:43:14.910 --> 03:43:14.920 align:start position:0%
school somewhere in the public schools
 
03:43:17.630 --> 03:43:17.640 align:start position:0%
uh get a higher percentage of those
 
03:43:19.070 --> 03:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
students who you know have a little bit
 
03:43:20.830 --> 03:43:20.840 align:start position:0%
more difficulty reaching their academic
 
03:43:22.309 --> 03:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
goals than the ones that are in these
 
03:43:22.319 --> 03:43:24.309 align:start position:0%
goals than the ones that are in these
institutions

03:43:24.309 --> 03:43:24.319 align:start position:0%
institutions
 
03:43:28.389 --> 03:43:28.399 align:start position:0%
so further yes go ahead okay thank you
 
03:43:30.510 --> 03:43:30.520 align:start position:0%
chairman uh thank you representative for
 
03:43:31.429 --> 03:43:31.439 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
03:43:34.389 --> 03:43:34.399 align:start position:0%
question you stated in your testimony
 
03:43:36.710 --> 03:43:36.720 align:start position:0%
that you felt this program is wildly out
 
03:43:39.269 --> 03:43:39.279 align:start position:0%
of control yeah couldn't that conversely
 
03:43:42.389 --> 03:43:42.399 align:start position:0%
be construed as wildly
 
03:43:45.710 --> 03:43:45.720 align:start position:0%
successful um I
 
03:43:47.349 --> 03:43:47.359 align:start position:0%
it's it's successful for the families
 
03:43:49.189 --> 03:43:49.199 align:start position:0%
who who benefit from them but I think
 
03:43:51.429 --> 03:43:51.439 align:start position:0%
it's not not necessarily successful for
 
03:43:54.349 --> 03:43:54.359 align:start position:0%
the population as a whole so and one
 
03:43:57.630 --> 03:43:57.640 align:start position:0%
thing about all these education debates
 
03:44:00.910 --> 03:44:00.920 align:start position:0%
too is that families generally speaking
 
03:44:02.229 --> 03:44:02.239 align:start position:0%
and the children themselves like the
 
03:44:05.550 --> 03:44:05.560 align:start position:0%
schools they're at so uh much as we
 
03:44:08.309 --> 03:44:08.319 align:start position:0%
Grumble about education and what very
 
03:44:10.070 --> 03:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
obviously very difficult process very
 
03:44:12.590 --> 03:44:12.600 align:start position:0%
long and painful process going through
 
03:44:15.469 --> 03:44:15.479 align:start position:0%
Elementary and secondary education but
 
03:44:17.750 --> 03:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
most families you know most children and
 
03:44:19.870 --> 03:44:19.880 align:start position:0%
most parents like their schools whatever
 
03:44:21.630 --> 03:44:21.640 align:start position:0%
type of school it is and like their like
 
03:44:23.469 --> 03:44:23.479 align:start position:0%
their teachers one thing with the debate
 
03:44:24.630 --> 03:44:24.640 align:start position:0%
is the public
 
03:44:27.710 --> 03:44:27.720 align:start position:0%
schools don't have as much don't have
 
03:44:29.469 --> 03:44:29.479 align:start position:0%
much opportunity to come to conquer like
 
03:44:33.710 --> 03:44:33.720 align:start position:0%
so if a child like say uh I to live near
 
03:44:34.950 --> 03:44:34.960 align:start position:0%
the school bus stomp from my
 
03:44:36.469 --> 03:44:36.479 align:start position:0%
neighborhood back it's right across the
 
03:44:38.229 --> 03:44:38.239 align:start position:0%
street so those kids who get picked up
 
03:44:42.349 --> 03:44:42.359 align:start position:0%
around and get at 8 8 8 8:10 a.m. and it
 
03:44:44.590 --> 03:44:44.600 align:start position:0%
get dropped off you know they're they're
 
03:44:46.990 --> 03:44:47.000 align:start position:0%
happy going to school you know I mean
 
03:44:48.990 --> 03:44:49.000 align:start position:0%
maybe not sometimes they Grumble but
 
03:44:50.070 --> 03:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
they're they're happy to be going to
 
03:44:52.389 --> 03:44:52.399 align:start position:0%
school they're uh having a positive
 
03:44:55.070 --> 03:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
experience while there and they're um
 
03:44:56.510 --> 03:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
dropped off again having had a
 
03:44:59.110 --> 03:44:59.120 align:start position:0%
productive day and um they're very cute
 
03:45:00.550 --> 03:45:00.560 align:start position:0%
very beautiful and doing great things
 
03:45:02.790 --> 03:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
and we don't see these we don't see
 
03:45:04.149 --> 03:45:04.159 align:start position:0%
these kids just because they're in
 
03:45:06.189 --> 03:45:06.199 align:start position:0%
school and you know Public Schools can't
 
03:45:09.030 --> 03:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
bu students here to up here to the
 
03:45:10.990 --> 03:45:11.000 align:start position:0%
second floor of the LLB to attend
 
03:45:13.830 --> 03:45:13.840 align:start position:0%
education funding or education policy
 
03:45:16.309 --> 03:45:16.319 align:start position:0%
committee hearings and then often times
 
03:45:18.870 --> 03:45:18.880 align:start position:0%
the parents or other people affiliated
 
03:45:21.189 --> 03:45:21.199 align:start position:0%
with the other forms of Education make
 
03:45:22.630 --> 03:45:22.640 align:start position:0%
uh comments about our public schools
 
03:45:24.110 --> 03:45:24.120 align:start position:0%
which are pass more negative than what
 
03:45:25.469 --> 03:45:25.479 align:start position:0%
they should be Although our Public
 
03:45:27.349 --> 03:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
Schools you know are far from perfect
 
03:45:29.429 --> 03:45:29.439 align:start position:0%
and need to be improved
 
03:45:34.309 --> 03:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
but thank you was it repr
 
03:45:38.229 --> 03:45:38.239 align:start position:0%
names yeah I said I'd ask a couple of
 
03:45:40.229 --> 03:45:40.239 align:start position:0%
questions directly to the witness rather
 
03:45:42.990 --> 03:45:43.000 align:start position:0%
than to you U so I'm going to try to do
 
03:45:46.070 --> 03:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
that um
 
03:45:48.870 --> 03:45:48.880 align:start position:0%
representative haran do you um have
 
03:45:50.910 --> 03:45:50.920 align:start position:0%
information or knowledge
 
03:45:54.990 --> 03:45:55.000 align:start position:0%
of discriminatory practices that for a
 
03:45:58.389 --> 03:45:58.399 align:start position:0%
public school would be illegal that uh
 
03:46:01.469 --> 03:46:01.479 align:start position:0%
private school recipients of these
 
03:46:06.990 --> 03:46:07.000 align:start position:0%
EFA funds um may be engaging in um I
 
03:46:08.389 --> 03:46:08.399 align:start position:0%
think there I think there think there
 
03:46:11.189 --> 03:46:11.199 align:start position:0%
are some um I'm not prepared to go into
 
03:46:13.429 --> 03:46:13.439 align:start position:0%
like whole detail about it that's
 
03:46:15.429 --> 03:46:15.439 align:start position:0%
another Poss another topic that should
 
03:46:18.110 --> 03:46:18.120 align:start position:0%
be studied I mean certainly we certainly
 
03:46:20.830 --> 03:46:20.840 align:start position:0%
in terms of a religious discrimination
 
03:46:23.830 --> 03:46:23.840 align:start position:0%
just even though these religious schols
 
03:46:25.469 --> 03:46:25.479 align:start position:0%
will admit people from other faiths
 
03:46:28.469 --> 03:46:28.479 align:start position:0%
obviously that's obviously there's uh
 
03:46:30.590 --> 03:46:30.600 align:start position:0%
the parents religious beliefs have to be
 
03:46:32.510 --> 03:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
at least somewhat compatible with the
 
03:46:35.510 --> 03:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
religious beliefs of the school um and
 
03:46:37.110 --> 03:46:37.120 align:start position:0%
um so I think there's a certain amount
 
03:46:39.790 --> 03:46:39.800 align:start position:0%
of that even um you know I mean they're
 
03:46:41.750 --> 03:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
all run by honorable people and they
 
03:46:43.710 --> 03:46:43.720 align:start position:0%
make an effort to be inclusive and uh
 
03:46:46.710 --> 03:46:46.720 align:start position:0%
you know we still you know we still have
 
03:46:48.510 --> 03:46:48.520 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination laws on the books
 
03:46:50.030 --> 03:46:50.040 align:start position:0%
regardless of any you know executive
 
03:46:51.590 --> 03:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
orders that may have been introduced in
 
03:46:53.429 --> 03:46:53.439 align:start position:0%
Washington DC but although that's not
 
03:46:54.830 --> 03:46:54.840 align:start position:0%
really our problem we're in Conquer New
 
03:46:55.950 --> 03:46:55.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we've got enough to worry
 
03:46:57.550 --> 03:46:57.560 align:start position:0%
about so I think there may be problems
 
03:46:59.870 --> 03:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
in that that certainly should be looked
 
03:47:02.550 --> 03:47:02.560 align:start position:0%
into further question repres
 
03:47:05.710 --> 03:47:05.720 align:start position:0%
B uh clarification Mr
 
03:47:08.229 --> 03:47:08.239 align:start position:0%
chairman I'm a little confused earlier
 
03:47:11.269 --> 03:47:11.279 align:start position:0%
you said that you seem to infer that the
 
03:47:15.670 --> 03:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
3700 people who voted who weighed in
 
03:47:18.950 --> 03:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
because it was competing with at a time
 
03:47:21.990 --> 03:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
when they were feeling tax poor that
 
03:47:26.349 --> 03:47:26.359 align:start position:0%
their opinion was less valuable than the
 
03:47:28.870 --> 03:47:28.880 align:start position:0%
even number of people who attended the
 
03:47:31.990 --> 03:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
hearing I I don't think you meant to do
 
03:47:35.269 --> 03:47:35.279 align:start position:0%
that uh I I would hope we would respect
 
03:47:38.389 --> 03:47:38.399 align:start position:0%
the people who can't get to conquered
 
03:47:41.710 --> 03:47:41.720 align:start position:0%
and weigh in as equal to the people who
 
03:47:44.830 --> 03:47:44.840 align:start position:0%
come to the actual hearing make their
 
03:47:48.269 --> 03:47:48.279 align:start position:0%
feelings known the fact is there was a 4
 
03:47:52.269 --> 03:47:52.279 align:start position:0%
to1 ratio of people opposed mainly
 
03:47:56.950 --> 03:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
because I think it they see it's a uh a
 
03:48:00.070 --> 03:48:00.080 align:start position:0%
conflict uh not not necessar
 
03:48:02.429 --> 03:48:02.439 align:start position:0%
religious but at a time when the state
 
03:48:04.910 --> 03:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
is Cash
 
03:48:08.309 --> 03:48:08.319 align:start position:0%
trapped it seems to be a a a use of
 
03:48:12.269 --> 03:48:12.279 align:start position:0%
funds that is out of control anyone who
 
03:48:14.349 --> 03:48:14.359 align:start position:0%
has an income a high income can
 
03:48:14.359 --> 03:48:16.269 align:start position:0%
has an income a high income can
participate

03:48:16.269 --> 03:48:16.279 align:start position:0%
participate
 
03:48:19.590 --> 03:48:19.600 align:start position:0%
I I don't think you meant to do that did
 
03:48:22.269 --> 03:48:22.279 align:start position:0%
you I think you're asserting a lot of
 
03:48:25.750 --> 03:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
your personal opinion into this thing um
 
03:48:28.269 --> 03:48:28.279 align:start position:0%
I indicated that yes we had a number of
 
03:48:31.349 --> 03:48:31.359 align:start position:0%
people in the portal who signed
 
03:48:33.830 --> 03:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
in but when we came to the actual
 
03:48:33.840 --> 03:48:35.309 align:start position:0%
in but when we came to the actual
hearing

03:48:35.309 --> 03:48:35.319 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
03:48:37.750 --> 03:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
itself it went back and forth back and
 
03:48:41.670 --> 03:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
forth throughout the day uh so that's
 
03:48:44.830 --> 03:48:44.840 align:start position:0%
where I was coming from that there are
 
03:48:46.630 --> 03:48:46.640 align:start position:0%
two sides to this
 
03:48:49.510 --> 03:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
equation and uh the number of people
 
03:48:52.870 --> 03:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
that came in on the portal
 
03:48:56.309 --> 03:48:56.319 align:start position:0%
um there there are large large groups
 
03:48:58.349 --> 03:48:58.359 align:start position:0%
out there that can send out boom and it
 
03:49:00.110 --> 03:49:00.120 align:start position:0%
hits you know a couple thousand people
 
03:49:03.110 --> 03:49:03.120 align:start position:0%
just like that and you can have coming
 
03:49:05.510 --> 03:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
in I respect all the people that come in
 
03:49:08.070 --> 03:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
a portal don't misunderstand me there
 
03:49:10.630 --> 03:49:10.640 align:start position:0%
and I respect that
 
03:49:13.990 --> 03:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
message um so where I am right now on
 
03:49:15.229 --> 03:49:15.239 align:start position:0%
this particular
 
03:49:17.590 --> 03:49:17.600 align:start position:0%
bill this particular bill is dealing
 
03:49:20.189 --> 03:49:20.199 align:start position:0%
with one section of one thing that's the
 
03:49:22.910 --> 03:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
use of money used for religious schools
 
03:49:24.670 --> 03:49:24.680 align:start position:0%
by the EFA
 
03:49:27.670 --> 03:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
program and some of the areas we're
 
03:49:29.870 --> 03:49:29.880 align:start position:0%
getting into are discussions which
 
03:49:32.510 --> 03:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
belong in the policy and administration
 
03:49:34.750 --> 03:49:34.760 align:start position:0%
committee they're the ones which would
 
03:49:39.110 --> 03:49:39.120 align:start position:0%
do oversight of the EFA program we're
 
03:49:42.790 --> 03:49:42.800 align:start position:0%
looking primarily at the fiscal impacts
 
03:49:44.910 --> 03:49:44.920 align:start position:0%
that this program may have on our state
 
03:49:48.790 --> 03:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
Budget on on on the revenues coming in
 
03:49:51.149 --> 03:49:51.159 align:start position:0%
and um that's what we're looking at and
 
03:49:54.070 --> 03:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
that's what we're hearing so um I think
 
03:49:56.269 --> 03:49:56.279 align:start position:0%
you've put a l a lot of inference into
 
03:49:59.870 --> 03:49:59.880 align:start position:0%
that represent Burton and um you're
 
03:50:01.590 --> 03:50:01.600 align:start position:0%
trying to read people's
 
03:50:04.950 --> 03:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
minds I would suggest that uh you are
 
03:50:07.830 --> 03:50:07.840 align:start position:0%
not reading mine properly I'm open to
 
03:50:09.910 --> 03:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
everybody participating everybody coming
 
03:50:12.269 --> 03:50:12.279 align:start position:0%
into a hearing we've always welcomed
 
03:50:14.830 --> 03:50:14.840 align:start position:0%
people as we're welcoming represent
 
03:50:17.429 --> 03:50:17.439 align:start position:0%
again today and he does a lot of work in
 
03:50:19.389 --> 03:50:19.399 align:start position:0%
putting his paperwork together when he
 
03:50:21.590 --> 03:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
comes in here and that's understood and
 
03:50:21.600 --> 03:50:22.710 align:start position:0%
comes in here and that's understood and
that's

03:50:22.710 --> 03:50:22.720 align:start position:0%
that's
 
03:50:25.389 --> 03:50:25.399 align:start position:0%
appreciated but in this particular
 
03:50:27.510 --> 03:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
situation right now I know where we're
 
03:50:29.630 --> 03:50:29.640 align:start position:0%
going to go with this thing we went last
 
03:50:32.229 --> 03:50:32.239 align:start position:0%
year when you weren't in the house it
 
03:50:34.389 --> 03:50:34.399 align:start position:0%
was pretty evenly split and we came out
 
03:50:37.550 --> 03:50:37.560 align:start position:0%
with numerous no recommendation votes
 
03:50:40.309 --> 03:50:40.319 align:start position:0%
this year I don't see that
 
03:50:44.149 --> 03:50:44.159 align:start position:0%
happening yes would you be willing to to
 
03:50:45.990 --> 03:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
put another number on the amount of
 
03:50:48.309 --> 03:50:48.319 align:start position:0%
money we should spend on this everything
 
03:50:49.830 --> 03:50:49.840 align:start position:0%
else in the budget is going to have a
 
03:50:52.189 --> 03:50:52.199 align:start position:0%
cap except this one you're going Way
 
03:50:54.510 --> 03:50:54.520 align:start position:0%
Beyond this bill now put a number on it
 
03:50:56.790 --> 03:50:56.800 align:start position:0%
well can you put a number on all the
 
03:50:58.950 --> 03:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
issues which we're talking about can you
 
03:51:01.630 --> 03:51:01.640 align:start position:0%
put a number on what we need to put on
 
03:51:03.229 --> 03:51:03.239 align:start position:0%
school building 8 the governor is going
 
03:51:04.830 --> 03:51:04.840 align:start position:0%
to put a number on all of those that's
 
03:51:07.309 --> 03:51:07.319 align:start position:0%
the Governor's job representa B except
 
03:51:08.830 --> 03:51:08.840 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to get into a discussion
 
03:51:10.630 --> 03:51:10.640 align:start position:0%
with you at this meeting on that that's
 
03:51:13.630 --> 03:51:13.640 align:start position:0%
way off task of this hearing are there
 
03:51:16.870 --> 03:51:16.880 align:start position:0%
any other questions regarding this Bill
 
03:51:18.189 --> 03:51:18.199 align:start position:0%
yes represent
 
03:51:22.269 --> 03:51:22.279 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair um I'm asking
 
03:51:24.830 --> 03:51:24.840 align:start position:0%
for clarification from your remarks a
 
03:51:28.469 --> 03:51:28.479 align:start position:0%
moment ago I believe you were saying
 
03:51:30.550 --> 03:51:30.560 align:start position:0%
that this bill should perhaps be heard
 
03:51:32.870 --> 03:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
in the other education committee did I
 
03:51:35.429 --> 03:51:35.439 align:start position:0%
understand no that's not what I said
 
03:51:36.349 --> 03:51:36.359 align:start position:0%
well that's why I asked for
 
03:51:38.870 --> 03:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
clarification there are policy issues
 
03:51:40.950 --> 03:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
associated with the EFA program which
 
03:51:45.429 --> 03:51:45.439 align:start position:0%
are strictly policy issues and not money
 
03:51:49.070 --> 03:51:49.080 align:start position:0%
issues this when we come to the bills
 
03:51:52.349 --> 03:51:52.359 align:start position:0%
which come to this committee on efas we
 
03:51:54.189 --> 03:51:54.199 align:start position:0%
are directly looking at the fiscal
 
03:51:57.790 --> 03:51:57.800 align:start position:0%
impacts to our state budget that's the
 
03:52:01.149 --> 03:52:01.159 align:start position:0%
mission of this committee right here the
 
03:52:03.110 --> 03:52:03.120 align:start position:0%
other side of the coin where we talk
 
03:52:06.510 --> 03:52:06.520 align:start position:0%
strictly policy and physical is when it
 
03:52:08.070 --> 03:52:08.080 align:start position:0%
comes to Career Technical education
 
03:52:10.030 --> 03:52:10.040 align:start position:0%
higher education all those other
 
03:52:12.990 --> 03:52:13.000 align:start position:0%
programs have been left to the other
 
03:52:17.229 --> 03:52:17.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:19.590 --> 03:52:19.600 align:start position:0%
committee and that was one the reason
 
03:52:21.429 --> 03:52:21.439 align:start position:0%
why we did it you saw the load you were
 
03:52:23.070 --> 03:52:23.080 align:start position:0%
on it last year you know the load of
 
03:52:25.389 --> 03:52:25.399 align:start position:0%
bills which we came in and we had
 
03:52:27.750 --> 03:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
virtually no time for subcommittee work
 
03:52:30.229 --> 03:52:30.239 align:start position:0%
at all we're just trying to get bills
 
03:52:34.229 --> 03:52:34.239 align:start position:0%
heard exact and out and doing that with
 
03:52:36.229 --> 03:52:36.239 align:start position:0%
those 235 bills over the course of that
 
03:52:38.790 --> 03:52:38.800 align:start position:0%
buying was a real load that's why we
 
03:52:41.070 --> 03:52:41.080 align:start position:0%
split this up so when it comes to the
 
03:52:43.429 --> 03:52:43.439 align:start position:0%
policy side that's their chore on the
 
03:52:45.229 --> 03:52:45.239 align:start position:0%
other side of
 
03:52:47.870 --> 03:52:47.880 align:start position:0%
well you in this room we're not
 
03:52:52.349 --> 03:52:52.359 align:start position:0%
here may I yes thank you I appreciate
 
03:52:55.269 --> 03:52:55.279 align:start position:0%
the explanation and review for all of us
 
03:52:57.349 --> 03:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
and I do appreciate that there are two
 
03:52:59.910 --> 03:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
education committees as you noted last
 
03:53:03.349 --> 03:53:03.359 align:start position:0%
year's workload was very
 
03:53:06.269 --> 03:53:06.279 align:start position:0%
significant and that leads me
 
03:53:11.590 --> 03:53:11.600 align:start position:0%
to um respectfully urge that we do have
 
03:53:13.670 --> 03:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
a work session on this bill so that we
 
03:53:16.349 --> 03:53:16.359 align:start position:0%
can get full financial information as
 
03:53:17.710 --> 03:53:17.720 align:start position:0%
much as it's
 
03:53:20.750 --> 03:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
available on the costs
 
03:53:24.510 --> 03:53:24.520 align:start position:0%
of the spending through the EFA program
 
03:53:26.990 --> 03:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
for religious schools or other religious
 
03:53:29.349 --> 03:53:29.359 align:start position:0%
expenses I think we should have that
 
03:53:31.870 --> 03:53:31.880 align:start position:0%
information I do not feel like I
 
03:53:33.990 --> 03:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
received that information in the hearing
 
03:53:37.349 --> 03:53:37.359 align:start position:0%
on 115 last week and it seems to me
 
03:53:39.630 --> 03:53:39.640 align:start position:0%
there's a number of other folks with
 
03:53:42.030 --> 03:53:42.040 align:start position:0%
questions are there any other
 
03:53:45.149 --> 03:53:45.159 align:start position:0%
questions of the
 
03:53:45.159 --> 03:53:46.389 align:start position:0%
questions of the
person

03:53:46.389 --> 03:53:46.399 align:start position:0%
person
 
03:53:48.830 --> 03:53:48.840 align:start position:0%
testifying yes ref some
 
03:53:53.149 --> 03:53:53.159 align:start position:0%
mire thank you Mr chairman um I'd like
 
03:53:56.389 --> 03:53:56.399 align:start position:0%
to our chairman made a interesting uh
 
03:54:00.870 --> 03:54:00.880 align:start position:0%
point about um the legal history of this
 
03:54:03.990 --> 03:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
topic right that that that the religious
 
03:54:06.870 --> 03:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
aspect has been litigated and courts
 
03:54:11.070 --> 03:54:11.080 align:start position:0%
have found that what we're doing is
 
03:54:15.229 --> 03:54:15.239 align:start position:0%
constitutional and that um should we try
 
03:54:17.950 --> 03:54:17.960 align:start position:0%
to discriminate against
 
03:54:21.830 --> 03:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
religious um schools or persons in the
 
03:54:24.469 --> 03:54:24.479 align:start position:0%
way that that this bill might
 
03:54:29.030 --> 03:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
do we might run a foul of of
 
03:54:31.349 --> 03:54:31.359 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination aspect so what do
 
03:54:34.710 --> 03:54:34.720 align:start position:0%
you think of of um that argument well
 
03:54:37.389 --> 03:54:37.399 align:start position:0%
the the Court decisions Al there have
 
03:54:38.830 --> 03:54:38.840 align:start position:0%
been many Federal Court decisions
 
03:54:41.590 --> 03:54:41.600 align:start position:0%
related to um government expenditures
 
03:54:43.870 --> 03:54:43.880 align:start position:0%
supporting religious education but some
 
03:54:43.880 --> 03:54:45.229 align:start position:0%
supporting religious education but some
mostly

03:54:45.229 --> 03:54:45.239 align:start position:0%
mostly
 
03:54:47.950 --> 03:54:47.960 align:start position:0%
and most of those don't apply any the
 
03:54:50.590 --> 03:54:50.600 align:start position:0%
situations those applies to are not 100%
 
03:54:53.790 --> 03:54:53.800 align:start position:0%
analogous to this one and the um just on
 
03:54:56.070 --> 03:54:56.080 align:start position:0%
the state level state level I think the
 
03:54:57.750 --> 03:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
black the plain letter law of the
 
03:54:59.670 --> 03:54:59.680 align:start position:0%
Constitution is pretty clear that this
 
03:55:01.590 --> 03:55:01.600 align:start position:0%
program is a violation of the of the
 
03:55:05.309 --> 03:55:05.319 align:start position:0%
State uh of the uh state constitution I
 
03:55:07.349 --> 03:55:07.359 align:start position:0%
think there's Federal issues with it too
 
03:55:11.590 --> 03:55:11.600 align:start position:0%
and also we um of course an alternative
 
03:55:13.189 --> 03:55:13.199 align:start position:0%
alter another alternative approach you
 
03:55:15.469 --> 03:55:15.479 align:start position:0%
can take uh which I would consider and
 
03:55:17.389 --> 03:55:17.399 align:start position:0%
that not be a popular Amendment but I
 
03:55:18.750 --> 03:55:18.760 align:start position:0%
would consider a friendly Amendment
 
03:55:20.429 --> 03:55:20.439 align:start position:0%
would be just to phase out the program
 
03:55:22.990 --> 03:55:23.000 align:start position:0%
Al together because I think um I think I
 
03:55:24.670 --> 03:55:24.680 align:start position:0%
think it's I think it's not a good
 
03:55:26.389 --> 03:55:26.399 align:start position:0%
policy on top of you know top of the
 
03:55:27.910 --> 03:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
Constitutional issue I also think it's a
 
03:55:30.429 --> 03:55:30.439 align:start position:0%
bad policy and one one of the choices we
 
03:55:34.590 --> 03:55:34.600 align:start position:0%
have is to uh just you know get rid of
 
03:55:35.910 --> 03:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
it you probably have to phase it out
 
03:55:37.710 --> 03:55:37.720 align:start position:0%
over the course of at least a year
 
03:55:39.590 --> 03:55:39.600 align:start position:0%
because families are depending on it in
 
03:55:43.870 --> 03:55:43.880 align:start position:0%
good faith but um yeah so that's um so I
 
03:55:46.590 --> 03:55:46.600 align:start position:0%
I if I if I believed that this bill was
 
03:55:48.750 --> 03:55:48.760 align:start position:0%
totally unconstitutional I would not I
 
03:55:50.790 --> 03:55:50.800 align:start position:0%
would not have filed it and I probably
 
03:55:53.670 --> 03:55:53.680 align:start position:0%
would have also been at least chided by
 
03:55:56.790 --> 03:55:56.800 align:start position:0%
the drafting attorney that this is this
 
03:55:59.149 --> 03:55:59.159 align:start position:0%
is UN that this is unconstitutional but
 
03:56:01.429 --> 03:56:01.439 align:start position:0%
this this similar language has been
 
03:56:04.349 --> 03:56:04.359 align:start position:0%
approved by ol you know last session and
 
03:56:06.870 --> 03:56:06.880 align:start position:0%
this session and there's also also even
 
03:56:08.309 --> 03:56:08.319 align:start position:0%
if you don't like the religious
 
03:56:10.070 --> 03:56:10.080 align:start position:0%
education part there are like the last
 
03:56:11.550 --> 03:56:11.560 align:start position:0%
two sections of bill which we didn't
 
03:56:13.630 --> 03:56:13.640 align:start position:0%
talk about much and those those have
 
03:56:16.030 --> 03:56:16.040 align:start position:0%
Merit on their own to regardless of the
 
03:56:19.990 --> 03:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
religious issue thanks any further
 
03:56:23.469 --> 03:56:23.479 align:start position:0%
questions represent mhan thank you thank
 
03:56:25.590 --> 03:56:25.600 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman I I just have a question
 
03:56:28.189 --> 03:56:28.199 align:start position:0%
from the article that you raised what I
 
03:56:29.630 --> 03:56:29.640 align:start position:0%
see in that article from the conquer
 
03:56:31.429 --> 03:56:31.439 align:start position:0%
monitor is a significant choice that
 
03:56:32.750 --> 03:56:32.760 align:start position:0%
people have made it's almost a
 
03:56:36.070 --> 03:56:36.080 align:start position:0%
unilateral Choice do you think it's wise
 
03:56:39.110 --> 03:56:39.120 align:start position:0%
to um to deny them their constitutional
 
03:56:40.510 --> 03:56:40.520 align:start position:0%
right to the free practice of their
 
03:56:40.520 --> 03:56:45.189 align:start position:0%
right to the free practice of their
choices

03:56:45.189 --> 03:56:45.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:47.790 --> 03:56:47.800 align:start position:0%
I mean I don't think I don't think
 
03:56:49.910 --> 03:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
restricting or Li this program like
 
03:56:53.469 --> 03:56:53.479 align:start position:0%
restricts anybody's religious choices I
 
03:56:55.790 --> 03:56:55.800 align:start position:0%
mean families do have different choices
 
03:56:58.590 --> 03:56:58.600 align:start position:0%
if we subsidize certain forms of
 
03:57:01.469 --> 03:57:01.479 align:start position:0%
Education that will incentivize them to
 
03:57:03.429 --> 03:57:03.439 align:start position:0%
choose that over others but think it's
 
03:57:06.550 --> 03:57:06.560 align:start position:0%
there's still other ways they can be
 
03:57:08.990 --> 03:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
able to make make that choice and um and
 
03:57:10.030 --> 03:57:10.040 align:start position:0%
even with the current income
 
03:57:12.269 --> 03:57:12.279 align:start position:0%
restrictions they're fairly uh fairly
 
03:57:14.750 --> 03:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
liberal especially
 
03:57:16.710 --> 03:57:16.720 align:start position:0%
because there's a provision that if you
 
03:57:17.950 --> 03:57:17.960 align:start position:0%
put your child in there even in
 
03:57:19.790 --> 03:57:19.800 align:start position:0%
kindergarten they're eligible until they
 
03:57:21.510 --> 03:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
graduate from high school and usually
 
03:57:22.870 --> 03:57:22.880 align:start position:0%
the family
 
03:57:25.309 --> 03:57:25.319 align:start position:0%
income if if your parents are like most
 
03:57:27.630 --> 03:57:27.640 align:start position:0%
parents they're like uh in the they're
 
03:57:30.710 --> 03:57:30.720 align:start position:0%
in a um time of life when their earnings
 
03:57:32.469 --> 03:57:32.479 align:start position:0%
potential like increases a lot every
 
03:57:34.910 --> 03:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
year too so the families most cases the
 
03:57:37.309 --> 03:57:37.319 align:start position:0%
family's uh income if things go the way
 
03:57:38.790 --> 03:57:38.800 align:start position:0%
they should and usually be as like Much
 
03:57:41.269 --> 03:57:41.279 align:start position:0%
Higher by the time that the child is is
 
03:57:43.229 --> 03:57:43.239 align:start position:0%
out of there and that's actually not
 
03:57:44.950 --> 03:57:44.960 align:start position:0%
addressed by this spill but that's like
 
03:57:47.870 --> 03:57:47.880 align:start position:0%
a something that you could look at as uh
 
03:57:49.429 --> 03:57:49.439 align:start position:0%
changing the way the eligibility is
 
03:57:52.189 --> 03:57:52.199 align:start position:0%
determined but so that's long with
 
03:57:54.870 --> 03:57:54.880 align:start position:0%
answer but I mean I think you have the
 
03:57:56.990 --> 03:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
freedom of freedom of religion anyway
 
03:57:59.670 --> 03:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
and also the Constitution the state
 
03:58:03.070 --> 03:58:03.080 align:start position:0%
constitution rision is also like so that
 
03:58:06.030 --> 03:58:06.040 align:start position:0%
uh people aren't citizens aren't um
 
03:58:08.389 --> 03:58:08.399 align:start position:0%
subsidizing being forced to subsidize
 
03:58:10.189 --> 03:58:10.199 align:start position:0%
somebody else's religion which I believe
 
03:58:12.670 --> 03:58:12.680 align:start position:0%
is this current
 
03:58:15.189 --> 03:58:15.199 align:start position:0%
situation that answer your question but
 
03:58:17.349 --> 03:58:17.359 align:start position:0%
thanks are there further questions from
 
03:58:17.359 --> 03:58:18.429 align:start position:0%
thanks are there further questions from
the

03:58:18.429 --> 03:58:18.439 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:58:21.309 --> 03:58:21.319 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any any further
 
03:58:25.189 --> 03:58:25.199 align:start position:0%
cards red card pink cards out there none
 
03:58:28.229 --> 03:58:28.239 align:start position:0%
coming in
 
03:58:32.389 --> 03:58:32.399 align:start position:0%
so only one so with that I so with that
 
03:58:34.070 --> 03:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to close this hearing on
 
03:58:39.189 --> 03:58:39.199 align:start position:0%
than you on HB 549 thank you so I have a
 
03:58:42.870 --> 03:58:42.880 align:start position:0%
question for oh for you about can what
 
03:58:44.870 --> 03:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
can we do to make sure we get people
 
03:58:46.590 --> 03:58:46.600 align:start position:0%
here from the Department of Education
 
03:58:53.269 --> 03:58:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:56.750 --> 03:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
session for which work session well the
 
03:59:00.710 --> 03:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
one there's one next week oh that that
 
03:59:02.870 --> 03:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
that s yes they've already been
 
03:59:06.030 --> 03:59:06.040 align:start position:0%
contacted yeah yeah yeah I thought you
 
03:59:10.229 --> 03:59:10.239 align:start position:0%
were referencing this okay no no the the
 
03:59:12.510 --> 03:59:12.520 align:start position:0%
the Department's already commun uh been
 
03:59:14.630 --> 03:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
contacted regarding what's going on on
 
03:59:17.590 --> 03:59:17.600 align:start position:0%
Friday next week on Thursday we are
 
03:59:19.469 --> 03:59:19.479 align:start position:0%
looking at four bills which deal
 
03:59:21.870 --> 03:59:21.880 align:start position:0%
specifically with special
 
03:59:24.990 --> 03:59:25.000 align:start position:0%
education couple catastrophic bills or
 
03:59:27.030 --> 03:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
special education Aid and the others on
 
03:59:28.070 --> 03:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
the other side of the coin on
 
03:59:31.309 --> 03:59:31.319 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid uh that portion of it
 
03:59:34.429 --> 03:59:34.439 align:start position:0%
we will be starting that on on uh all
 
03:59:36.710 --> 03:59:36.720 align:start position:0%
all that morning on Friday morning there
 
03:59:38.950 --> 03:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
will be a work session for that topic
 
03:59:41.110 --> 03:59:41.120 align:start position:0%
we'll be doing similar type work
 
03:59:42.590 --> 03:59:42.600 align:start position:0%
sessions and I'm not saying that's the
 
03:59:44.389 --> 03:59:44.399 align:start position:0%
end of it either for the special Ed
 
03:59:46.990 --> 03:59:47.000 align:start position:0%
because the catastrophic Aid is one
 
03:59:49.269 --> 03:59:49.279 align:start position:0%
where I also have this evening a
 
03:59:53.630 --> 03:59:53.640 align:start position:0%
teleconference call with a individual in
 
03:59:56.510 --> 03:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
Arkansas which is in charge of the
 
04:00:00.550 --> 04:00:00.560 align:start position:0%
catastrophic uh program down there and
 
04:00:02.189 --> 04:00:02.199 align:start position:0%
trying to find out they have some
 
04:00:04.389 --> 04:00:04.399 align:start position:0%
interesting Financial ways of handling
 
04:00:06.110 --> 04:00:06.120 align:start position:0%
that a little different than how we do
 
04:00:09.030 --> 04:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
it with 70 grand up top for the district
 
04:00:11.429 --> 04:00:11.439 align:start position:0%
and then going on with the 2080 right up
 
04:00:13.510 --> 04:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
through the 10 times that comes out
 
04:00:16.309 --> 04:00:16.319 align:start position:0%
little sh of $100,000 you have to put
 
04:00:19.189 --> 04:00:19.199 align:start position:0%
forth immediately as as a
 
04:00:22.670 --> 04:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
town and they are putting forward a
 
04:00:25.910 --> 04:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
system where the first $155,000 is on
 
04:00:29.670 --> 04:00:29.680 align:start position:0%
the town from 15 to
 
04:00:34.389 --> 04:00:34.399 align:start position:0%
$65,000 it's 100% on the state and from
 
04:00:39.229 --> 04:00:39.239 align:start position:0%
65% on up to I I'm I'm estimating from
 
04:00:40.429 --> 04:00:40.439 align:start position:0%
doing the reading through the lines
 
04:00:42.149 --> 04:00:42.159 align:start position:0%
here's about $ 110
 
04:00:44.550 --> 04:00:44.560 align:start position:0%
$120,000 there's a combination between
 
04:00:48.790 --> 04:00:48.800 align:start position:0%
State and uh local but going beyond that
 
04:00:51.110 --> 04:00:51.120 align:start position:0%
the state has a
 
04:00:54.389 --> 04:00:54.399 align:start position:0%
cap and that's just one system that I've
 
04:00:56.790 --> 04:00:56.800 align:start position:0%
looked at you can find these on the
 
04:00:58.229 --> 04:00:58.239 align:start position:0%
education Commission of the states and
 
04:01:00.670 --> 04:01:00.680 align:start position:0%
so I've had our research gen do some
 
04:01:02.950 --> 04:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
contacting and we're trying to set up a
 
04:01:05.070 --> 04:01:05.080 align:start position:0%
a system where we can get this
 
04:01:06.429 --> 04:01:06.439 align:start position:0%
information and find out is there
 
04:01:08.030 --> 04:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
another way of handling this because we
 
04:01:10.750 --> 04:01:10.760 align:start position:0%
have bills coming in oh drop it a 3% or
 
04:01:12.870 --> 04:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
three times drop it a two times what's
 
04:01:14.349 --> 04:01:14.359 align:start position:0%
the difference well we trying to get a
 
04:01:16.070 --> 04:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
handle on what type numbers of kids
 
04:01:19.070 --> 04:01:19.080 align:start position:0%
that's dealing with and then we've also
 
04:01:21.229 --> 04:01:21.239 align:start position:0%
have other forms coming in where we're
 
04:01:24.590 --> 04:01:24.600 align:start position:0%
change that pration rate where you prate
 
04:01:27.670 --> 04:01:27.680 align:start position:0%
the monies if you're not meeting that uh
 
04:01:31.149 --> 04:01:31.159 align:start position:0%
$34 million and it's coming out 51 point
 
04:01:33.630 --> 04:01:33.640 align:start position:0%
something uh you have to make that $17
 
04:01:37.070 --> 04:01:37.080 align:start position:0%
million up well we prate it and now
 
04:01:40.750 --> 04:01:40.760 align:start position:0%
we're prorating somewhere around 67 68%
 
04:01:43.510 --> 04:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
right now we've done that in the past we
 
04:01:44.830 --> 04:01:44.840 align:start position:0%
did it back in
 
04:01:47.389 --> 04:01:47.399 align:start position:0%
2013 we climbed out of it and we've
 
04:01:50.229 --> 04:01:50.239 align:start position:0%
recently been funding pretty much all of
 
04:01:53.389 --> 04:01:53.399 align:start position:0%
it however it's it's we haven't done
 
04:01:56.269 --> 04:01:56.279 align:start position:0%
that this year for whatever reason I
 
04:02:00.429 --> 04:02:00.439 align:start position:0%
don't know but uh we cannot continue
 
04:02:03.389 --> 04:02:03.399 align:start position:0%
like this districts cannot handle this
 
04:02:05.349 --> 04:02:05.359 align:start position:0%
it's it's a cost it's just hitting them
 
04:02:08.429 --> 04:02:08.439 align:start position:0%
boom like hitting a brick wall and so
 
04:02:10.030 --> 04:02:10.040 align:start position:0%
there probably will be further
 
04:02:12.149 --> 04:02:12.159 align:start position:0%
conversations on this we have the whole
 
04:02:13.469 --> 04:02:13.479 align:start position:0%
month of February where we're going to
 
04:02:14.670 --> 04:02:14.680 align:start position:0%
be working on this and there's going to
 
04:02:16.269 --> 04:02:16.279 align:start position:0%
be a lot of work
 
04:02:18.510 --> 04:02:18.520 align:start position:0%
sessions and then we tackle the other
 
04:02:20.670 --> 04:02:20.680 align:start position:0%
subjects which we have and you know what
 
04:02:23.630 --> 04:02:23.640 align:start position:0%
they are um those are going to be just
 
04:02:26.309 --> 04:02:26.319 align:start position:0%
as difficult uh seeing that we're
 
04:02:28.670 --> 04:02:28.680 align:start position:0%
hearing departments being told right now
 
04:02:34.070 --> 04:02:34.080 align:start position:0%
cut it 4% cut at 8% cut it 10% cut it
 
04:02:36.469 --> 04:02:36.479 align:start position:0%
14% um
 
04:02:40.790 --> 04:02:40.800 align:start position:0%
that has to be dealt with um if we if we
 
04:02:42.550 --> 04:02:42.560 align:start position:0%
have to do that if we have to do that if
 
04:02:44.670 --> 04:02:44.680 align:start position:0%
Revenue say that's where we go
 
04:02:46.349 --> 04:02:46.359 align:start position:0%
then we're going to we're going to have
 
04:02:48.469 --> 04:02:48.479 align:start position:0%
to make some decisions here from this
 
04:02:51.070 --> 04:02:51.080 align:start position:0%
education funding policy
 
04:02:54.269 --> 04:02:54.279 align:start position:0%
side how do we prioritize
 
04:02:58.149 --> 04:02:58.159 align:start position:0%
that so I I see this as you know and and
 
04:02:59.790 --> 04:02:59.800 align:start position:0%
those people coming over to where
 
04:03:03.309 --> 04:03:03.319 align:start position:0%
borrowing from Finance we appreciate
 
04:03:06.189 --> 04:03:06.199 align:start position:0%
their support and help in doing that and
 
04:03:07.950 --> 04:03:07.960 align:start position:0%
the people that coming that had
 
04:03:09.349 --> 04:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
experience on ways and means there's
 
04:03:12.990 --> 04:03:13.000 align:start position:0%
several here right now um we got to look
 
04:03:15.429 --> 04:03:15.439 align:start position:0%
at every so that that's what's I'll tell
 
04:03:17.550 --> 04:03:17.560 align:start position:0%
you this is the program these are the
 
04:03:20.510 --> 04:03:20.520 align:start position:0%
programs which are bothering me the
 
04:03:23.269 --> 04:03:23.279 align:start position:0%
most because they hit everybody in this
 
04:03:25.149 --> 04:03:25.159 align:start position:0%
state and they hit our
 
04:03:29.110 --> 04:03:29.120 align:start position:0%
Workforce and so it's a it's a
 
04:03:32.950 --> 04:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
challenge yeah can you you've got a we
 
04:03:35.269 --> 04:03:35.279 align:start position:0%
may have exact sections next Tuesday I
 
04:03:39.110 --> 04:03:39.120 align:start position:0%
think on there we put that on the bottom
 
04:03:41.910 --> 04:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
there I always work with the ranking
 
04:03:44.349 --> 04:03:44.359 align:start position:0%
representative who's not here
 
04:03:48.030 --> 04:03:48.040 align:start position:0%
and we try to find those bills which we
 
04:03:48.040 --> 04:03:49.990 align:start position:0%
and we try to find those bills which we
can

04:03:49.990 --> 04:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
can
 
04:03:53.990 --> 04:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
pass with a majority or very close to a
 
04:03:56.229 --> 04:03:56.239 align:start position:0%
majority maybe one shallow or something
 
04:03:59.429 --> 04:03:59.439 align:start position:0%
like that but by doing that I'm also
 
04:04:03.070 --> 04:04:03.080 align:start position:0%
cognizant that for those District
 
04:04:05.349 --> 04:04:05.359 align:start position:0%
committees to put that little line
 
04:04:07.469 --> 04:04:07.479 align:start position:0%
underneath you always had to worry about
 
04:04:10.189 --> 04:04:10.199 align:start position:0%
getting substitutes for your committee
 
04:04:13.830 --> 04:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
that's a costly deal yeah and so if if
 
04:04:15.269 --> 04:04:15.279 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:04:18.710 --> 04:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
that we'll let you know through your
 
04:04:21.469 --> 04:04:21.479 align:start position:0%
ranking or through you know the vice
 
04:04:23.750 --> 04:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
chair right here which ones we're going
 
04:04:26.309 --> 04:04:26.319 align:start position:0%
to attack there's some bills we know
 
04:04:28.269 --> 04:04:28.279 align:start position:0%
with a proper Amendment we're going to
 
04:04:30.950 --> 04:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
get those things out of here and and we
 
04:04:33.349 --> 04:04:33.359 align:start position:0%
can get it out with a strong vote
 
04:04:35.349 --> 04:04:35.359 align:start position:0%
hopefully get them on consent if not get
 
04:04:37.429 --> 04:04:37.439 align:start position:0%
them leased onto the calendar where we
 
04:04:39.870 --> 04:04:39.880 align:start position:0%
know we can debate them on the floor I
 
04:04:41.990 --> 04:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
I'm just I'm collecting all kinds of
 
04:04:45.590 --> 04:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
material on uh due process from the
 
04:04:48.429 --> 04:04:48.439 align:start position:0%
University system I was just I'm not
 
04:04:50.110 --> 04:04:50.120 align:start position:0%
being controversial I just that will
 
04:04:51.950 --> 04:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
probably come in because you you made a
 
04:04:53.710 --> 04:04:53.720 align:start position:0%
comment uh last time that you're going
 
04:04:56.510 --> 04:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
to try to get the early bills out oh not
 
04:04:59.910 --> 04:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
try we got to yeah okay March 6 is our
 
04:05:03.149 --> 04:05:03.159 align:start position:0%
date there and when we when I went back
 
04:05:04.950 --> 04:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
to the desk last night and found nine
 
04:05:08.590 --> 04:05:08.600 align:start position:0%
new early bills sitting on top of us or
 
04:05:13.870 --> 04:05:13.880 align:start position:0%
not nine it was 12 or 11 or 12 yeah and
 
04:05:17.790 --> 04:05:17.800 align:start position:0%
was wow okay and so we had to schedule
 
04:05:19.429 --> 04:05:19.439 align:start position:0%
bills coming up in the calendar next
 
04:05:21.229 --> 04:05:21.239 align:start position:0%
week before we knew about these other
 
04:05:23.349 --> 04:05:23.359 align:start position:0%
early bills coming at us so you're going
 
04:05:24.910 --> 04:05:24.920 align:start position:0%
to see some other bills on there that
 
04:05:27.309 --> 04:05:27.319 align:start position:0%
are bills which are more or less
 
04:05:31.429 --> 04:05:31.439 align:start position:0%
strictly policy from the CTE and the HD
 
04:05:33.070 --> 04:05:33.080 align:start position:0%
uh which we should be able to get
 
04:05:35.429 --> 04:05:35.439 align:start position:0%
through but they take time for every
 
04:05:37.910 --> 04:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
hearing there's an executive session I
 
04:05:41.110 --> 04:05:41.120 align:start position:0%
know so I'm I'm trying to get these
 
04:05:43.990 --> 04:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
early bills done first now they some
 
04:05:46.510 --> 04:05:46.520 align:start position:0%
today which weren't early bills but they
 
04:05:48.710 --> 04:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
were the bills which were left over of
 
04:05:50.149 --> 04:05:50.159 align:start position:0%
those first bills there's only one that
 
04:05:51.830 --> 04:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
we haven't done but we now have a slug
 
04:05:53.389 --> 04:05:53.399 align:start position:0%
of others saying we have 40 bills out
 
04:05:55.309 --> 04:05:55.319 align:start position:0%
there I just have to tell a kennel when
 
04:05:58.429 --> 04:05:58.439 align:start position:0%
I'm picking up my dog that's all yeah
 
04:06:02.030 --> 04:06:02.040 align:start position:0%
so so yeah so uh we will have work
 
04:06:03.830 --> 04:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
sessions that was the whole concept
 
04:06:06.269 --> 04:06:06.279 align:start position:0%
behind this but I want to have the work
 
04:06:08.830 --> 04:06:08.840 align:start position:0%
sessions first for the bills I know
 
04:06:11.550 --> 04:06:11.560 align:start position:0%
we've got to do something with and I
 
04:06:14.030 --> 04:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
know we have to be respectful those
 
04:06:16.870 --> 04:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
towns which are not with the money to do
 
04:06:18.630 --> 04:06:18.640 align:start position:0%
what we think they can we got to be
 
04:06:20.910 --> 04:06:20.920 align:start position:0%
asking those good questions why are you
 
04:06:23.149 --> 04:06:23.159 align:start position:0%
unable to do that is it because of the
 
04:06:25.630 --> 04:06:25.640 align:start position:0%
dollar sign or is it possibly because of
 
04:06:27.510 --> 04:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
the aspiration of the community or your
 
04:06:30.630 --> 04:06:30.640 align:start position:0%
school board or you know all those other
 
04:06:35.110 --> 04:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
issues which can you know impact
 
04:06:37.149 --> 04:06:37.159 align:start position:0%
attitudes and all that the stuff that
 
04:06:40.469 --> 04:06:40.479 align:start position:0%
you can't buy with your dollar sign uh
 
04:06:43.269 --> 04:06:43.279 align:start position:0%
that that's a real Factor I've seen that
 
04:06:43.279 --> 04:06:44.429 align:start position:0%
that that's a real Factor I've seen that
in

04:06:44.429 --> 04:06:44.439 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:06:49.030 --> 04:06:49.040 align:start position:0%
schools uh how there some of it is
 
04:06:52.070 --> 04:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
leadership and so so we got our work cut
 
04:06:53.990 --> 04:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
out for us and I just hope we can stick
 
04:06:55.269 --> 04:06:55.279 align:start position:0%
together and just try to get our
 
04:06:57.750 --> 04:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
priorities together rather than trying
 
04:06:59.590 --> 04:06:59.600 align:start position:0%
to tackle everything with equal amount
 
04:07:03.229 --> 04:07:03.239 align:start position:0%
of time we learned last year those bills
 
04:07:05.309 --> 04:07:05.319 align:start position:0%
come out with no recommendation you
 
04:07:07.710 --> 04:07:07.720 align:start position:0%
can't fix them you go through everything
 
04:07:09.830 --> 04:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
octopath itl this and this and this you
 
04:07:11.429 --> 04:07:11.439 align:start position:0%
finally come out no recommendation get
 
04:07:13.750 --> 04:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
in the floor and you hammer it out again
 
04:07:16.590 --> 04:07:16.600 align:start position:0%
and then somebody gets up let's table it
 
04:07:19.070 --> 04:07:19.080 align:start position:0%
you know all those hours spent and days
 
04:07:21.269 --> 04:07:21.279 align:start position:0%
spent on this stuff we could have been
 
04:07:25.189 --> 04:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
using for the things we need to be doing
 
04:07:26.670 --> 04:07:26.680 align:start position:0%
not that we shouldn't be doing that
 
04:07:29.070 --> 04:07:29.080 align:start position:0%
other stuff but where we know we can get
 
04:07:29.080 --> 04:07:30.590 align:start position:0%
other stuff but where we know we can get
the

04:07:30.590 --> 04:07:30.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:07:33.229 --> 04:07:33.239 align:start position:0%
compromise I I'm a firm believer that
 
04:07:35.750 --> 04:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
legislation legislator can be very
 
04:07:38.389 --> 04:07:38.399 align:start position:0%
effective I saw it happen when I first
 
04:07:39.990 --> 04:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
got on board
 
04:07:43.590 --> 04:07:43.600 align:start position:0%
here and it was one where we sat
 
04:07:45.910 --> 04:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
together we went out to lunch together
 
04:07:49.189 --> 04:07:49.199 align:start position:0%
and but we all knew where we stood but
 
04:07:52.469 --> 04:07:52.479 align:start position:0%
we Tred to work and find that common end
 
04:07:55.670 --> 04:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
we did on a lot of bills we really did
 
04:07:58.670 --> 04:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
um it's it's sort of gone the that other
 
04:08:01.349 --> 04:08:01.359 align:start position:0%
direction and not just in the last
 
04:08:04.870 --> 04:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
several years it it's been gradually
 
04:08:07.670 --> 04:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
happening represent McGuire and thank
 
04:08:12.469 --> 04:08:12.479 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman so um I a few remarks on
 
04:08:15.950 --> 04:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
all this schle and so on um I really
 
04:08:19.349 --> 04:08:19.359 align:start position:0%
appreciate your um pushing us to
 
04:08:22.550 --> 04:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
emphasize those bills that that are
 
04:08:26.229 --> 04:08:26.239 align:start position:0%
likely to to uh to pass or maybe close
 
04:08:28.830 --> 04:08:28.840 align:start position:0%
to not passing but but sort of the ones
 
04:08:32.670 --> 04:08:32.680 align:start position:0%
that that um have a chance right because
 
04:08:35.189 --> 04:08:35.199 align:start position:0%
um and not spend a lot of time on those
 
04:08:39.229 --> 04:08:39.239 align:start position:0%
that don't um just because myself and my
 
04:08:40.950 --> 04:08:40.960 align:start position:0%
two colleagues who haven't been here
 
04:08:44.910 --> 04:08:44.920 align:start position:0%
much um we get really busy 3 weeks from
 
04:08:47.510 --> 04:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
now so and I will push them I will talk
 
04:08:50.469 --> 04:08:50.479 align:start position:0%
to them and push them to join us for the
 
04:08:53.349 --> 04:08:53.359 align:start position:0%
next 3 weeks so that we have you know
 
04:08:56.429 --> 04:08:56.439 align:start position:0%
we're more at full strength um my
 
04:08:58.590 --> 04:08:58.600 align:start position:0%
question to you was
 
04:09:01.469 --> 04:09:01.479 align:start position:0%
um do you plan when we were doing this
 
04:09:06.590 --> 04:09:06.600 align:start position:0%
work session uh phase to uh split into
 
04:09:08.950 --> 04:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittees or to be generally
 
04:09:11.950 --> 04:09:11.960 align:start position:0%
speaking a full committee on all the
 
04:09:14.870 --> 04:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
bills that's a a very good question uh
 
04:09:16.109 --> 04:09:16.119 align:start position:0%
I've always as I said at the very
 
04:09:17.309 --> 04:09:17.319 align:start position:0%
beginning I
 
04:09:21.670 --> 04:09:21.680 align:start position:0%
always done uh with this committee the
 
04:09:23.269 --> 04:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
education policy Committee in the past
 
04:09:25.109 --> 04:09:25.119 align:start position:0%
when we've had an opportunity I like
 
04:09:28.630 --> 04:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
Committee of the whole however um there
 
04:09:31.229 --> 04:09:31.239 align:start position:0%
have been times to when we dealt with I
 
04:09:32.870 --> 04:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
can remember a bill years ago when we
 
04:09:35.269 --> 04:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
went to concussion injury amongst our
 
04:09:38.030 --> 04:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
athletes on the field and we broke that
 
04:09:40.990 --> 04:09:41.000 align:start position:0%
down into a smaller subgroup about five
 
04:09:44.189 --> 04:09:44.199 align:start position:0%
people we invited people in from the FL
 
04:09:47.309 --> 04:09:47.319 align:start position:0%
and we we took testimony as we went down
 
04:09:50.349 --> 04:09:50.359 align:start position:0%
the road it took us about 3 years to get
 
04:09:52.309 --> 04:09:52.319 align:start position:0%
that bill finally where we wanted to get
 
04:09:54.389 --> 04:09:54.399 align:start position:0%
it after talking with the nursing
 
04:09:59.349 --> 04:09:59.359 align:start position:0%
associations and and Sports nhia Group
 
04:10:01.950 --> 04:10:01.960 align:start position:0%
and in schools and administrators and
 
04:10:04.750 --> 04:10:04.760 align:start position:0%
teachers and parents and trying to find
 
04:10:06.790 --> 04:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
when is advisable what conditions do you
 
04:10:08.670 --> 04:10:08.680 align:start position:0%
need to get the kid back on the field of
 
04:10:10.269 --> 04:10:10.279 align:start position:0%
course you need a doctor they said a
 
04:10:12.109 --> 04:10:12.119 align:start position:0%
doctor's permission I said you also need
 
04:10:14.030 --> 04:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
the parents permission
 
04:10:16.630 --> 04:10:16.640 align:start position:0%
and so we got great Bill small group
 
04:10:19.309 --> 04:10:19.319 align:start position:0%
though it was a working group and
 
04:10:21.269 --> 04:10:21.279 align:start position:0%
represent McGuire I know that you're
 
04:10:22.750 --> 04:10:22.760 align:start position:0%
used to working like on those divisions
 
04:10:24.910 --> 04:10:24.920 align:start position:0%
up in finance which are small groups to
 
04:10:28.710 --> 04:10:28.720 align:start position:0%
begin with but um here we're we're we
 
04:10:32.269 --> 04:10:32.279 align:start position:0%
got the task of also looking at policy
 
04:10:35.349 --> 04:10:35.359 align:start position:0%
and fiscal side as well to send it on to
 
04:10:36.910 --> 04:10:36.920 align:start position:0%
these guys right there that are going to
 
04:10:40.109 --> 04:10:40.119 align:start position:0%
be able to not spend as much time on the
 
04:10:42.750 --> 04:10:42.760 align:start position:0%
policy side because they've often times
 
04:10:45.910 --> 04:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
done the work that we should do and and
 
04:10:47.790 --> 04:10:47.800 align:start position:0%
they've ended up spending their wheels
 
04:10:49.389 --> 04:10:49.399 align:start position:0%
when in fact they have the big picture
 
04:10:52.109 --> 04:10:52.119 align:start position:0%
of hb1 staring them in the face and
 
04:10:54.229 --> 04:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
that's what this bium this year is all
 
04:10:57.550 --> 04:10:57.560 align:start position:0%
about so we will have undoubtedly on
 
04:10:59.910 --> 04:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
some groups we may split it up small so
 
04:11:02.950 --> 04:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
we can do two things at one time the the
 
04:11:05.550 --> 04:11:05.560 align:start position:0%
counter to that is there's some folks
 
04:11:07.030 --> 04:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
there are some people that counter to
 
04:11:09.149 --> 04:11:09.159 align:start position:0%
having two education committees because
 
04:11:10.429 --> 04:11:10.439 align:start position:0%
they felt well that's going to
 
04:11:11.630 --> 04:11:11.640 align:start position:0%
something's going to go on there and I
 
04:11:14.070 --> 04:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
don't know about and I want to stay a
 
04:11:16.630 --> 04:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
breast of that so I can be knowledgeable
 
04:11:20.429 --> 04:11:20.439 align:start position:0%
when I'm working later on I get it and
 
04:11:22.870 --> 04:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
so it's and also when we have the
 
04:11:25.030 --> 04:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
committee a whole sometimes we don't get
 
04:11:27.710 --> 04:11:27.720 align:start position:0%
people coming and and then it whittles
 
04:11:31.109 --> 04:11:31.119 align:start position:0%
down to a smaller group anyways but I
 
04:11:33.510 --> 04:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
there I sometimes I've asked who wants
 
04:11:35.630 --> 04:11:35.640 align:start position:0%
to be on it by the hands pop up from all
 
04:11:39.670 --> 04:11:39.680 align:start position:0%
over the place um so it's I'm going to
 
04:11:41.510 --> 04:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
have to work that one out some will be
 
04:11:44.149 --> 04:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
small some are going to be the whole
 
04:11:46.030 --> 04:11:46.040 align:start position:0%
and you know there's when we're talking
 
04:11:46.040 --> 04:11:47.109 align:start position:0%
and you know there's when we're talking
about

04:11:47.109 --> 04:11:47.119 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:11:49.389 --> 04:11:49.399 align:start position:0%
Finance that's where for example a
 
04:11:52.550 --> 04:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
person would dick ames's background
 
04:11:55.109 --> 04:11:55.119 align:start position:0%
would be very very valuable Sally you've
 
04:11:57.990 --> 04:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
got a whole background on how things
 
04:12:01.229 --> 04:12:01.239 align:start position:0%
worked over at the
 
04:12:03.349 --> 04:12:03.359 align:start position:0%
department that history is going to be
 
04:12:05.269 --> 04:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
necessary right now if we have to do a
 
04:12:07.189 --> 04:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
lot of cutting we're going to have to
 
04:12:09.950 --> 04:12:09.960 align:start position:0%
know where we got can and where this
 
04:12:15.109 --> 04:12:15.119 align:start position:0%
funding's coming from Ways and Means
 
04:12:17.630 --> 04:12:17.640 align:start position:0%
so so if you don't get put on something
 
04:12:18.950 --> 04:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
believe me you'll be put on something
 
04:12:21.030 --> 04:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
else and I can remember when I first got
 
04:12:24.870 --> 04:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
on board Mary guile was one of them um
 
04:12:27.590 --> 04:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh representative Rouse was there prior
 
04:12:33.229 --> 04:12:33.239 align:start position:0%
to Mary but um Emma but uh the she would
 
04:12:35.309 --> 04:12:35.319 align:start position:0%
stand sit right here and say okay I am
 
04:12:37.149 --> 04:12:37.159 align:start position:0%
putting on it these five people well
 
04:12:39.229 --> 04:12:39.239 align:start position:0%
bing bing bing bing bing you know three
 
04:12:41.710 --> 04:12:41.720 align:start position:0%
dams and two Republicans she made that
 
04:12:44.790 --> 04:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
mind up I I also want to find out before
 
04:12:48.510 --> 04:12:48.520 align:start position:0%
we do that whether for example Sally
 
04:12:50.750 --> 04:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
fellows is going to be available to be
 
04:12:53.510 --> 04:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
one of those five people and so I I have
 
04:12:55.229 --> 04:12:55.239 align:start position:0%
to do that chatting and that's where I
 
04:12:58.030 --> 04:12:58.040 align:start position:0%
work with with the ranking Democrat
 
04:13:00.710 --> 04:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
right here and and and I would be
 
04:13:02.990 --> 04:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
working with a vice chair trying to find
 
04:13:06.790 --> 04:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
out who who they recommend to so it's
 
04:13:08.750 --> 04:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
just not Rick lad making these decisions
 
04:13:12.109 --> 04:13:12.119 align:start position:0%
alone so I don't have all those
 
04:13:14.309 --> 04:13:14.319 align:start position:0%
answers anything else for the good of
 
04:13:18.630 --> 04:13:18.640 align:start position:0%
the order right now any other Pearls of
 
04:13:20.710 --> 04:13:20.720 align:start position:0%

04:13:22.550 --> 04:13:22.560 align:start position:0%

easy coming you know I scheduled it
 
04:13:33.149 --> 04:13:33.159 align:start position:0%
there just simply because it could have
 
04:13:35.550 --> 04:13:35.560 align:start position:0%
been a whole load of people like as you
 
04:13:37.910 --> 04:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned the beginning and or it went
 
04:13:40.710 --> 04:13:40.720 align:start position:0%
the other way um hard to predict it's
 
04:13:44.429 --> 04:13:44.439 align:start position:0%
hard to predict yeah
 
04:14:12.030 --> 04:14:12.040 align:start position:0%
