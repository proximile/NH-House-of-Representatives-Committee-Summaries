00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:27.750 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:30.949 --> 00:09:30.959 align:start position:0%
so just to remind everybody that uh
 
00:09:32.389 --> 00:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
the schedule
 
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:35.200 align:start position:0%
for early bills was pushed up a week so
 
00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.230 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:40.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:09:43.269 --> 00:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:43.279 --> 00:09:45.750 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:47.829 --> 00:09:47.839 align:start position:0%
uh why was it pushed up a week there was
 
00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:50.800 align:start position:0%
something about scheduling the exact the
 
00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:51.910 align:start position:0%
something about scheduling the exact the
actual

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
actual
 
00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:53.910 align:start position:0%
actual
session

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:09:55.829 --> 00:09:55.839 align:start position:0%
and so that the session was going to be
 
00:09:58.949 --> 00:09:58.959 align:start position:0%
the 17th i believe
 
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
so uh of february yeah so i'm not sure
 
00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:05.519 align:start position:0%
what the what the the issue was but they
 
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
we were told to you know get get
 
00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
everything out this week
 
00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:10.389 align:start position:0%
everything out this week
so

00:10:10.389 --> 00:10:10.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:12.720 align:start position:0%
so you need to do what you're told
 
00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.990 align:start position:0%
so you need to do what you're told
i

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
no i had scheduled so that we could
 
00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
exact tomorrow
 
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
if necessary
 
00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
so we could we didn't i give it give it
 
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
you know another
 
00:10:36.389 --> 00:10:36.399 align:start position:0%
we might need more subcommittees right
 
00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
there's another issue which is up north
 
00:10:40.949 --> 00:10:40.959 align:start position:0%
there's going to be an ice storm
 
00:10:40.959 --> 00:10:41.670 align:start position:0%
there's going to be an ice storm
so

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:41.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
so you might not want to be here
 
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
tomorrow well i'll do everything i can
 
00:10:47.269 --> 00:10:47.279 align:start position:0%
but i'm not gonna drive in a sleet storm
 
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:53.269 --> 00:10:53.279 align:start position:0%
all right um so we'll start out uh the
 
00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
first one up is the
 
00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:00.230 align:start position:0%
first one up is the
uh

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
uh what what do we have here uh no
 
00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
that's the public hearing where's my sub
 
00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:06.160 align:start position:0%
where's my subcommittee work schedule
 
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
here we have okay the mental health
 
00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
parity all right
 
00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
so we have in front of us two different
 
00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
amendments on the mental health parity
 
00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
one is that i drew up
 
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
related to
 
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
the issue of
 
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:24.160 align:start position:0%
what is going on in terms of getting
 
00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
whether we really have adequate coverage
 
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
in in terms of network adequacy
 
00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.150 align:start position:0%
in in terms of network adequacy
and

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
my my approach is to
 
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
say that we can solve
 
00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:38.240 align:start position:0%
the fact that the physician the mental
 
00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
health providers are not getting paid
 
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
enough if we put pressure on in
 
00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
ensuring that the network is truly
 
00:11:47.269 --> 00:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
adequate and there's certainly enough
 
00:11:48.949 --> 00:11:48.959 align:start position:0%
providers there
 
00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:51.680 align:start position:0%
so um i now have another amendment here
 
00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:53.680 align:start position:0%
in front of me so uh representative leno
 
00:11:55.269 --> 00:11:55.279 align:start position:0%
you want to tell us what's in this
 
00:11:55.279 --> 00:11:56.629 align:start position:0%
you want to tell us what's in this
amendment

00:11:56.629 --> 00:11:56.639 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:12:01.829 --> 00:12:01.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:04.160 align:start position:0%
he's going to join join me also this
 
00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
morning so in in what you've got uh
 
00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
stapled in front of you john
 
00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
um mr chair is is actually three
 
00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:14.710 align:start position:0%
um mr chair is is actually three
amendments

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:16.949 --> 00:12:16.959 align:start position:0%
yeah because this this came
 
00:12:19.269 --> 00:12:19.279 align:start position:0%
as a result of um
 
00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
of negotiating um um an amendment with
 
00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:25.200 align:start position:0%
uh with the with anthem uh particularly
 
00:12:26.389 --> 00:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
with uh
 
00:12:28.629 --> 00:12:28.639 align:start position:0%
with um with ms rogers
 
00:12:28.639 --> 00:12:29.910 align:start position:0%
with um with ms rogers
uh

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
we we prepared um amendment four one one
 
00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
which is at the top of uh of that staple
 
00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:37.110 align:start position:0%
which is at the top of uh of that staple
sheet

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
sheet
 
00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
basically thins down the uh the bill
 
00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
quite substantially
 
00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:45.670 align:start position:0%
quite substantially
and

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
addresses directly i think the
 
00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
uh the some of the criticism we heard
 
00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
during the last work session with
 
00:12:57.269 --> 00:12:57.279 align:start position:0%
regards to requiring the same rate so it
 
00:12:59.269 --> 00:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
gets rid of the word rates
 
00:13:01.829 --> 00:13:01.839 align:start position:0%
in section 2 roman 2
 
00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
and replaces that with
 
00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
a statutory reference to the network
 
00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
adequacy standard in the state so now
 
00:13:11.509 --> 00:13:11.519 align:start position:0%
you would have that reference
 
00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:14.720 align:start position:0%
under the the mental health parity
 
00:13:16.949 --> 00:13:16.959 align:start position:0%
act in section two
 
00:13:20.949 --> 00:13:20.959 align:start position:0%
that that references 420 j7
 
00:13:20.959 --> 00:13:21.910 align:start position:0%
that that references 420 j7
so

00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:23.680 align:start position:0%
so provide benefit for treatment and
 
00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
diagnosis of certain biologically based
 
00:13:28.069 --> 00:13:28.079 align:start position:0%
mental illnesses under the same access
 
00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
standards established in 420 j colon 7
 
00:13:34.389 --> 00:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
comma terms and conditions
 
00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
which are no less extensive than
 
00:13:38.069 --> 00:13:38.079 align:start position:0%
coverage provided for any other type of
 
00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:40.160 align:start position:0%
any other type of health care for
 
00:13:44.389 --> 00:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
physical illness so now we've now we
 
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
we we're not requiring the same rates
 
00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
but at least the same access and
 
00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
availability and i think that's that's
 
00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
what came through loud and clear
 
00:13:55.509 --> 00:13:55.519 align:start position:0%
from the uh from last week's work
 
00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
session the second
 
00:13:59.430 --> 00:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
version so
 
00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
so these these sort of came over
 
00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:04.310 align:start position:0%
so these these sort of came over
sequentially

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
from anthem and um uh we're um
 
00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
and we're fine with this so this is now
 
00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:12.160 align:start position:0%
amendment 412
 
00:14:14.629 --> 00:14:14.639 align:start position:0%
where um where some of the language down
 
00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
on the
 
00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
section 2 roman 2
 
00:14:21.269 --> 00:14:21.279 align:start position:0%
lines 28 and 29
 
00:14:21.279 --> 00:14:22.389 align:start position:0%
lines 28 and 29
are

00:14:22.389 --> 00:14:22.399 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
sort of jiggled around a little bit to
 
00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
read better and um and ms rogers i think
 
00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:28.790 align:start position:0%
read better and um and ms rogers i think
can

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
can speak to um to the the rationale
 
00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
behind that it uh it doesn't change
 
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
anything materially from the from the
 
00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
amendment i just spoke about
 
00:14:42.949 --> 00:14:42.959 align:start position:0%
and then the third one which came over
 
00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
after i had
 
00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
sent the the other two
 
00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
up to the up over to
 
00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:51.189 align:start position:0%
up to the up over to
ols

00:14:51.189 --> 00:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
ols
 
00:14:53.189 --> 00:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
to be prepared
 
00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:56.720 align:start position:0%
strikes section 1 roman 2
 
00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:00.160 align:start position:0%
which is a reporting requirement
 
00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.350 align:start position:0%
which is a reporting requirement
to

00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
which would require the insurance
 
00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
department to
 
00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
to investigate violations of the
 
00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
wellstone domenici parity act
 
00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
and the reason section two has been
 
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
struck in this third version
 
00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
uh is because my understanding is that
 
00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:21.680 align:start position:0%
there is a senate bill
 
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
senate bill 373
 
00:15:27.509 --> 00:15:27.519 align:start position:0%
that is um has been put in i believe at
 
00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:29.680 align:start position:0%
the request of the department uh but uh
 
00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:32.240 align:start position:0%
mr brannon i think can uh can can
 
00:15:33.829 --> 00:15:33.839 align:start position:0%
clarify that
 
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
uh and so it would would not necessarily
 
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
be required to be in uh in this bill
 
00:15:44.069 --> 00:15:44.079 align:start position:0%
so so what we're offering mr chair
 
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
is um is uh is basically a bill that
 
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
that addresses that improves the mental
 
00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
health uh parity act by requiring
 
00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:57.430 align:start position:0%
health uh parity act by requiring
insurers

00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
insurers
 
00:16:00.389 --> 00:16:00.399 align:start position:0%
to comply with access standards access
 
00:16:02.949 --> 00:16:02.959 align:start position:0%
and availability standards that are in
 
00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
law today but in the the managed
 
00:16:09.749 --> 00:16:09.759 align:start position:0%
health care law but also apply those
 
00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
access and availability standards to the
 
00:16:15.749 --> 00:16:15.759 align:start position:0%
mental health parity um act so
 
00:16:18.949 --> 00:16:18.959 align:start position:0%
theoretically that should already be law
 
00:16:20.629 --> 00:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
it is law but it's and it's it's in the
 
00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
manage it's just not referenced in the
 
00:16:25.269 --> 00:16:25.279 align:start position:0%
uh okay so this is
 
00:16:27.189 --> 00:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
i think in the words of my former
 
00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
chairman this is belts and suspenders
 
00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:32.240 align:start position:0%
reaffirming something that's already in
 
00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
the stack could be in case it's in case
 
00:16:37.509 --> 00:16:37.519 align:start position:0%
it has gotten lost and uh and
 
00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
we certainly we certainly heard um heard
 
00:16:42.629 --> 00:16:42.639 align:start position:0%
substantial testimony
 
00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
to the lack of uh access and
 
00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
availability i mean if i'm if i'm a
 
00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
parent and my my child's got an earache
 
00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm i'm in the uh the physician's
 
00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:54.320 align:start position:0%
office in 15 minutes right and we need
 
00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
to have that so
 
00:16:57.509 --> 00:16:57.519 align:start position:0%
i just want you to know when you what
 
00:16:59.509 --> 00:16:59.519 align:start position:0%
you just said there was what the purpose
 
00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
of my amendment was
 
00:17:03.509 --> 00:17:03.519 align:start position:0%
was to make sure there was more
 
00:17:06.309 --> 00:17:06.319 align:start position:0%
availability access and availability
 
00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
okay so notwithstanding that uh we
 
00:17:13.029 --> 00:17:13.039 align:start position:0%
um i mean i i guess theoretically if if
 
00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
i find out that section two
 
00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
tyler just reaffirms it's already
 
00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
current law
 
00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
so all it is is it's kind of feel good
 
00:17:23.429 --> 00:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
but it reaffirms what we're doing
 
00:17:23.439 --> 00:17:24.870 align:start position:0%
but it reaffirms what we're doing
okay

00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't i i guess i would not
 
00:17:29.029 --> 00:17:29.039 align:start position:0%
particularly have a problem of adding
 
00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
this to to
 
00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
my amendment that that section um the
 
00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
preamble part no i don't i don't see any
 
00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:38.480 align:start position:0%
you know legislative
 
00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:40.640 align:start position:0%
need for the preamble part
 
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
uh but if this if this paragraph
 
00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:45.200 align:start position:0%
makes everybody feel a little better
 
00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
that that we're we're reaffirming what's
 
00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
current law then um i i can't
 
00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
particularly have a problem with it so
 
00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
so mr chair do we do do we think it's
 
00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
worth worth it for the uh for the
 
00:17:58.390 --> 00:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
committee to hear from uh the insurance
 
00:18:00.549 --> 00:18:00.559 align:start position:0%
department and also maybe i don't know
 
00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
if we have anybody with uh that
 
00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
represents providers with respect to uh
 
00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
to uh the uh the elements from the
 
00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
amendment that you had proposed oh right
 
00:18:13.029 --> 00:18:13.039 align:start position:0%
well i can see how providers might not
 
00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
like to have to make that phone call but
 
00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
if if
 
00:18:18.549 --> 00:18:18.559 align:start position:0%
they're making they're taking phone
 
00:18:19.909 --> 00:18:19.919 align:start position:0%
calls when people are calling up and
 
00:18:21.669 --> 00:18:21.679 align:start position:0%
saying will you take me as a patient and
 
00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
they have to say no
 
00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't it be easier just to call
 
00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
up the insurance
 
00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
company at the moment you're not taking
 
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
patients anymore and tell them yeah i i
 
00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
but i think it's just worth worth it
 
00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
hearing from uh from them if we're
 
00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
putting up well we're very limited on
 
00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
time here yep okay so is there any
 
00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:40.640 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee for
 
00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
representative leno
 
00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:44.240 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you very much for your
 
00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
testimony okay tyler you're on
 
00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:50.310 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
yeah

00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
could i just be clear about what we're
 
00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
doing yes i don't have um your amendment
 
00:18:57.990 --> 00:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
mr j uh i i it's it's over here i'm
 
00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
sorry i didn't no it wasn't we're going
 
00:19:02.549 --> 00:19:02.559 align:start position:0%
to request an another amendment that
 
00:19:05.029 --> 00:19:05.039 align:start position:0%
would be um
 
00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
we could be between now if we get this
 
00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
resolved we could have something for the
 
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
full committee at
 
00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
one o'clock 1 15. yep at one o'clock
 
00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
okay yep thanks very much yes please
 
00:19:18.549 --> 00:19:18.559 align:start position:0%
distribute it
 
00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
yeah okay no problem
 
00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:22.160 align:start position:0%
okay so tyler so
 
00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
so theoretically and i'm correct in
 
00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
saying that uh access standards
 
00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
establish that that's this the 420 j7 is
 
00:19:32.549 --> 00:19:32.559 align:start position:0%
universal it covers
 
00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
everything but by putting it into this
 
00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
paragraph it reaffirms that once again
 
00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:40.720 align:start position:0%
those procedures need to be followed
 
00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
yeah that's correct so the network
 
00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
adequacy section is statute is
 
00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
relatively general our administrative
 
00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
rule that deals with network adequacy
 
00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
which has specific time and distance
 
00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
standards potentially by county um there
 
00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
are actually services are divided into
 
00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
those that are most specialized those
 
00:19:58.789 --> 00:19:58.799 align:start position:0%
are least specialized and you should
 
00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
have the closest proximity to those
 
00:20:04.149 --> 00:20:04.159 align:start position:0%
services yep there are about 30 services
 
00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
in what we call considered core up there
 
00:20:08.549 --> 00:20:08.559 align:start position:0%
with primary care physical therapy about
 
00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
half of them are behavior health
 
00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:12.640 align:start position:0%
services so it's actually fairly robust
 
00:20:13.909 --> 00:20:13.919 align:start position:0%
when we look at kind of the network
 
00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
adequacy standard related to mental
 
00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
health when i say behavioral health i'm
 
00:20:19.669 --> 00:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
actually including sud but the point is
 
00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
yes we have a network adequate sustainer
 
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
general very detailed rule very strong
 
00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
standards for access to
 
00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
sud and mental services
 
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
okay great
 
00:20:32.149 --> 00:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
uh then in terms of my amendment which
 
00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
you drew up can you just briefly
 
00:20:36.549 --> 00:20:36.559 align:start position:0%
describe what this amendment does um
 
00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
that would address the
 
00:20:40.789 --> 00:20:40.799 align:start position:0%
it is currently required by federal law
 
00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
that carriers update their their
 
00:20:46.789 --> 00:20:46.799 align:start position:0%
provider directories and do so with a
 
00:20:48.549 --> 00:20:48.559 align:start position:0%
indicator as to whether the provider is
 
00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:51.440 align:start position:0%
accepting new patients however to the
 
00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:53.200 align:start position:0%
extent that we regulate the carrier if
 
00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
the carrier does not have current
 
00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:56.240 align:start position:0%
information from the provider then that
 
00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
creates a certain challenge in making
 
00:20:59.510 --> 00:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
sure that that kind of information is
 
00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
accurate so the amendment would make it
 
00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
clear that through a provider contract
 
00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
standard in other words the contract
 
00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
between the insurer and the provider
 
00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:09.200 align:start position:0%
would require the provider to tell the
 
00:21:11.029 --> 00:21:11.039 align:start position:0%
the carrier within i think it was two
 
00:21:13.669 --> 00:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
days right in a timely fashion actually
 
00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
30 days yeah timely fashion uh that
 
00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:18.320 align:start position:0%
they're no longer accepting new patients
 
00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
right okay
 
00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
any questions here
 
00:21:24.789 --> 00:21:24.799 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett okay i'm sorry
 
00:21:27.669 --> 00:21:27.679 align:start position:0%
um i just gonna clarify who who is
 
00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
actually gonna be responsible for
 
00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:30.710 align:start position:0%
actually gonna be responsible for
amending

00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
amending
 
00:21:32.789 --> 00:21:32.799 align:start position:0%
all these amendments i will take care of
 
00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:34.480 align:start position:0%
getting the amendment dropped okay got
 
00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:35.110 align:start position:0%
getting the amendment dropped okay got
it

00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:21:37.029 --> 00:21:37.039 align:start position:0%
thank and um do we have a number on the
 
00:21:38.549 --> 00:21:38.559 align:start position:0%
third amendment
 
00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:40.480 align:start position:0%
representative luna
 
00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:41.590 align:start position:0%
representative luna
okay

00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
but okay we're going to coordinate that
 
00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
before 1 15.
 
00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:47.669 align:start position:0%
before 1 15.
right

00:21:47.669 --> 00:21:47.679 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
i was going to as uh assume we didn't
 
00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:51.440 align:start position:0%

and that was in our discus the bill was
 
00:27:57.269 --> 00:27:57.279 align:start position:0%
to um reduce
 
00:28:00.549 --> 00:28:00.559 align:start position:0%
the tobacco requirement uh percentage
 
00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
requirement of a cigar bar
 
00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:05.200 align:start position:0%
um from uh
 
00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
60 to 50 uh for two years
 
00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
and sunset and put it back to where it
 
00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:12.710 align:start position:0%
and sunset and put it back to where it
was

00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
in the discussion of the bill
 
00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:17.190 align:start position:0%
in the discussion of the bill
we

00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
we talked a little bit about what was uh
 
00:28:23.909 --> 00:28:23.919 align:start position:0%
the 60 percent based on
 
00:28:23.919 --> 00:28:25.430 align:start position:0%
the 60 percent based on
and

00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
for better for worse the wisdom of the
 
00:28:29.269 --> 00:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
legislature when they passed the cigar
 
00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
bar legislation
 
00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:31.269 align:start position:0%
bar legislation
at

00:28:31.269 --> 00:28:31.279 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
the beginning
 
00:28:35.669 --> 00:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
uh emphasized uh that the it was
 
00:28:38.149 --> 00:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
expected that that 60 percent
 
00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
um would be just to back cigar type
 
00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:42.630 align:start position:0%
um would be just to back cigar type
products

00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:42.640 align:start position:0%
products
 
00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
and in particular it specifically said
 
00:28:47.269 --> 00:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
uh cigarettes
 
00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
and loose tobacco sales could not be
 
00:28:52.549 --> 00:28:52.559 align:start position:0%
included in the 60 percent
 
00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
um so in thinking about that i i'm
 
00:28:57.909 --> 00:28:57.919 align:start position:0%
thinking that that doesn't make sense
 
00:29:00.549 --> 00:29:00.559 align:start position:0%
because if they didn't have the wine if
 
00:29:02.549 --> 00:29:02.559 align:start position:0%
they weren't in this business if they
 
00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
were just a tobacco shop i'm sure that
 
00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
they would be selling cigarettes
 
00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
and so why would we mess with with the
 
00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
fundamental business model they should
 
00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
be having which is they're in the
 
00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
business of selling tobacco products
 
00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
which includes cigarettes and loose
 
00:29:20.789 --> 00:29:20.799 align:start position:0%
tobacco so basically all we did is move
 
00:29:20.799 --> 00:29:21.750 align:start position:0%
tobacco so basically all we did is move
the

00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
exemption line
 
00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:30.389 --> 00:29:30.399 align:start position:0%
any discussion
 
00:29:32.789 --> 00:29:32.799 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:34.640 align:start position:0%
yes representative bartlett okay thank
 
00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
you mr chair so um all this was doing
 
00:29:38.549 --> 00:29:38.559 align:start position:0%
was clarifying what we had in discussion
 
00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
during larry can you just move a little
 
00:29:43.669 --> 00:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
i need to talk about that um
 
00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
so this is just clarifying the
 
00:29:50.549 --> 00:29:50.559 align:start position:0%
discussion we had in the subcommittee
 
00:29:52.149 --> 00:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
about how
 
00:29:52.159 --> 00:29:53.190 align:start position:0%
about how
cigarette

00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:53.200 align:start position:0%
cigarette
 
00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:54.640 align:start position:0%
sales are
 
00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:56.720 align:start position:0%
audited is that correct right and then
 
00:29:58.870 --> 00:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
the next question i have is um
 
00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
so does this allow a cigar bar if the
 
00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
tobacco sales go up to be able to sell
 
00:30:07.269 --> 00:30:07.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:09.200 align:start position:0%
uh but i'm wondering theoretically that
 
00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:12.240 align:start position:0%
is true they could still their way of of
 
00:30:14.149 --> 00:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
increasing liquor sales
 
00:30:16.789 --> 00:30:16.799 align:start position:0%
they could sell more liquor if yeah if
 
00:30:18.549 --> 00:30:18.559 align:start position:0%
if all of a sudden you know having all
 
00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:22.240 align:start position:0%
this they're 60 but i i'm pretty sure
 
00:30:24.389 --> 00:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
that that it really doesn't that that
 
00:30:27.029 --> 00:30:27.039 align:start position:0%
the law wasn't driving that per se
 
00:30:27.039 --> 00:30:27.990 align:start position:0%
the law wasn't driving that per se
because

00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
once we said above 60 it didn't matter
 
00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
as long as they were selling plenty of
 
00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
tobacco products
 
00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
then there was never any pressure about
 
00:30:37.909 --> 00:30:37.919 align:start position:0%
how much alcohol they sold
 
00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:40.480 align:start position:0%
right so the fact that we're
 
00:30:42.549 --> 00:30:42.559 align:start position:0%
raising it doesn't mean all of a sudden
 
00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:45.440 align:start position:0%
they're going to go out and find more
 
00:30:47.909 --> 00:30:47.919 align:start position:0%
wine tasting you know whatever alcohol
 
00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
tasting customers
 
00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
see i'm i'm wondering if it's not a
 
00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
backdoor way of allowing more liquor
 
00:30:57.509 --> 00:30:57.519 align:start position:0%
sales in that that's where the profit is
 
00:30:57.519 --> 00:30:59.350 align:start position:0%
sales in that that's where the profit is
yeah

00:30:59.350 --> 00:30:59.360 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
i guess i'd like to hear from the liquor
 
00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:02.320 align:start position:0%
commission what their thoughts are on
 
00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
this uh okay there he is
 
00:31:08.789 --> 00:31:08.799 align:start position:0%
so yes representative johnson but they
 
00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
still have to sell 60
 
00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
of tobacco so it doesn't it doesn't
 
00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:15.440 align:start position:0%
change anything
 
00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
it just gives them more of a tobacco
 
00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
stuff that they can sell
 
00:31:22.149 --> 00:31:22.159 align:start position:0%
to meet that 60 marker
 
00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
right but it also when that gross
 
00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
revenue goes up it's also going to allow
 
00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
for um higher liquor sales
 
00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
increase liquor sales right
 
00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
my name is lieutenant matthew culver the
 
00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:38.240 align:start position:0%
new hampshire state liquor commission
 
00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
division of enforcement licensing thank
 
00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:40.549 align:start position:0%
division of enforcement licensing thank
you

00:31:40.549 --> 00:31:40.559 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
mr chairman and committee members
 
00:31:45.669 --> 00:31:45.679 align:start position:0%
that is correct uh fundamentally when
 
00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:48.480 align:start position:0%
you increase the revenue for the 60
 
00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:51.200 align:start position:0%
requirement in cigars or cigar related
 
00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:52.549 align:start position:0%
requirement in cigars or cigar related
products

00:31:52.549 --> 00:31:52.559 align:start position:0%
products
 
00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
you have the
 
00:31:57.430 --> 00:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
availability to increase the alcohol
 
00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
sales based on the data that we have on
 
00:32:04.389 --> 00:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
on these specific
 
00:32:07.029 --> 00:32:07.039 align:start position:0%
business models that have obtained
 
00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
recently obtained the cigar bar license
 
00:32:11.509 --> 00:32:11.519 align:start position:0%
we can
 
00:32:11.519 --> 00:32:12.549 align:start position:0%
we can
definitely

00:32:12.549 --> 00:32:12.559 align:start position:0%
definitely
 
00:32:14.789 --> 00:32:14.799 align:start position:0%
draw a conclusion
 
00:32:14.799 --> 00:32:16.389 align:start position:0%
draw a conclusion
that

00:32:16.389 --> 00:32:16.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:32:16.399 --> 00:32:17.509 align:start position:0%
that
the

00:32:17.509 --> 00:32:17.519 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
this those models are experiencing
 
00:32:22.389 --> 00:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
difficulties and compliance
 
00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
what we based on our data we can't draw
 
00:32:26.389 --> 00:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
the conclusion
 
00:32:29.509 --> 00:32:29.519 align:start position:0%
that that is based or has a propensity
 
00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
to be based on the increase of tobacco
 
00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:34.240 align:start position:0%
or alcohol sales
 
00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:35.190 align:start position:0%
or alcohol sales
so

00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:35.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
just because you are increasing the
 
00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
amount of alcohol sales doesn't mean
 
00:32:42.389 --> 00:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
that they're going to
 
00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:44.720 align:start position:0%
increase the amount of violations they
 
00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
have in fact with adding these products
 
00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:48.950 align:start position:0%
have in fact with adding these products
into

00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
into
 
00:32:49.909 --> 00:32:49.919 align:start position:0%
the law
 
00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
they're going to be
 
00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
uh there will be a larger chance of them
 
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:32:58.389 --> 00:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
um less non-compliant with a 60
 
00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
further question you may include
 
00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:04.789 align:start position:0%
further question you may include
so

00:33:04.789 --> 00:33:04.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
do we have even anecdotal
 
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
information about
 
00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
how many cigarettes are
 
00:33:15.029 --> 00:33:15.039 align:start position:0%
sold from a typical cigar bar i i know
 
00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:16.640 align:start position:0%
that hasn't been a
 
00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:23.200 align:start position:0%
we have some data on that it's not
 
00:33:25.269 --> 00:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
broken down by what kind of tobacco
 
00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:26.720 align:start position:0%
product it is
 
00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
we do have that data yes
 
00:33:33.669 --> 00:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
so the question is
 
00:33:33.679 --> 00:33:34.630 align:start position:0%
so the question is
has

00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:34.640 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:33:37.029 --> 00:33:37.039 align:start position:0%
given the current situation with the 60
 
00:33:40.389 --> 00:33:40.399 align:start position:0%
have businesses been saying no we can't
 
00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:42.640 align:start position:0%
sell you wine anymore this month because
 
00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
we've already hit our 60 percent
 
00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:46.640 align:start position:0%
have you ever had anybody who actually
 
00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
says to us 40 or 40 that that well the
 
00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
ratios were were out of whack that we
 
00:33:56.149 --> 00:33:56.159 align:start position:0%
got we got to shut down because of it
 
00:33:58.710 --> 00:33:58.720 align:start position:0%
yes that has occurred and in
 
00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
establishments that are that know that
 
00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
they're close to their 60 percent
 
00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:04.630 align:start position:0%
they're close to their 60 percent
requirement

00:34:04.630 --> 00:34:04.640 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
00:34:07.029 --> 00:34:07.039 align:start position:0%
60 40 ratio
 
00:34:07.039 --> 00:34:07.830 align:start position:0%
60 40 ratio
they

00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
monitor those sometimes on a daily basis
 
00:34:12.149 --> 00:34:12.159 align:start position:0%
per night that they're open
 
00:34:12.159 --> 00:34:12.869 align:start position:0%
per night that they're open
so

00:34:12.869 --> 00:34:12.879 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:34:15.349 --> 00:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
yes there are circumstances where
 
00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
they limit drink amounts to two drinks
 
00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
because if they serve four drinks their
 
00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
60 ratio is going to be
 
00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
way out of line and if they're way out
 
00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
of line more than
 
00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
say a week
 
00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:29.919 align:start position:0%
for their
 
00:34:31.669 --> 00:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
quarterly reports
 
00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
they're going to be
 
00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
by the end of that quarter massively out
 
00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
of compliance
 
00:34:38.470 --> 00:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
00:34:40.950 --> 00:34:40.960 align:start position:0%
so does the commission take a position
 
00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
on this um amendment because it sounds
 
00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
like your auditors had different ways of
 
00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:48.800 align:start position:0%
currently have different ways of
 
00:34:53.109 --> 00:34:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:55.669 --> 00:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
different ways of interpreting that
 
00:34:58.470 --> 00:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
other than cigar tobacco sales
 
00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
because it sounded like some were
 
00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
including the cigarettes and some were
 
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.030 align:start position:0%
including the cigarettes and some were
not

00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:35:05.829 --> 00:35:05.839 align:start position:0%
is that what we heard from testimony
 
00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
the tobacco the cigarette were
 
00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
specifically excluded from that so the
 
00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:14.240 align:start position:0%
law was specific on what was included in
 
00:35:17.349 --> 00:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
the cigar related products
 
00:35:19.589 --> 00:35:19.599 align:start position:0%
so does the commission take a position
 
00:35:23.109 --> 00:35:23.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
i believe that the commission is is
 
00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:26.720 align:start position:0%
remaining neutral on this yeah no as far
 
00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:28.640 align:start position:0%
as i know they're neutral
 
00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
i think the commission would be frank
 
00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
the commission's more worried about the
 
00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:34.470 align:start position:0%
the commission's more worried about the
hookahs

00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
hookahs
 
00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:36.160 align:start position:0%
and hookah
 
00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:38.720 align:start position:0%
is not as what i was concerned was loose
 
00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:41.200 align:start position:0%
tobacco but evidently it's not tobacco
 
00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:44.720 align:start position:0%
it's some other herbs and spices that so
 
00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:46.720 align:start position:0%
so in that sense we're not
 
00:35:49.109 --> 00:35:49.119 align:start position:0%
going we're not allowing that which that
 
00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
which is what the commission's already
 
00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:57.990 --> 00:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chair thank you
 
00:36:00.069 --> 00:36:00.079 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh loose tobacco
 
00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:02.320 align:start position:0%
to me would include pipe tobacco which
 
00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
is a an offering a lot of cigar shops um
 
00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
and they also sell pipes that could be a
 
00:36:11.109 --> 00:36:11.119 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars or more um
 
00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:14.240 align:start position:0%
should we're including cigar ashtrays
 
00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
should we include uh pipes for the loose
 
00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
and thank you for the question certainly
 
00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
that that is um a possibility to to look
 
00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:28.720 align:start position:0%
at to be included in in those types of
 
00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
products um just for point of
 
00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:32.720 align:start position:0%
clarification there department of
 
00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
revenue does
 
00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:36.710 align:start position:0%
revenue does
tax

00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
tax
 
00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
uh shisha or hookah okay on uh
 
00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
as loose tobacco
 
00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
oh okay so it is loose tobacco then i i
 
00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:47.440 align:start position:0%
think there's a discrepancy in the in
 
00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:48.310 align:start position:0%
think there's a discrepancy in the in
the

00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
definitions of that um i know there's a
 
00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:51.839 align:start position:0%
representative from health and human
 
00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
services here who
 
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:54.640 align:start position:0%
has it
 
00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
under their
 
00:36:57.430 --> 00:36:57.440 align:start position:0%
uh definitions have a different
 
00:36:59.270 --> 00:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
interpretation of that
 
00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:00.470 align:start position:0%
interpretation of that
okay

00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
all right well i think i was just trying
 
00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
to minimize what we're taking from one
 
00:37:07.030 --> 00:37:07.040 align:start position:0%
line and moving up to the x line uh but
 
00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
it sounds like that we need to wait to
 
00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:11.200 align:start position:0%
the dust settles on those
 
00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
those issues in terms of uh
 
00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:14.870 align:start position:0%
those issues in terms of uh
what

00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:37:17.349 --> 00:37:17.359 align:start position:0%
what what is in and what is out and and
 
00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
maybe we want to
 
00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
want to revisit this again in the future
 
00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:24.640 align:start position:0%
that may be beneficial to look at what
 
00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
these definitions uh
 
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
entail i know there's a discrepancy and
 
00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
definition between dra
 
00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:32.150 align:start position:0%
definition between dra
and

00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
but at the very
 
00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
basic level um including these products
 
00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
would assist cigar bar licensees in
 
00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
helping reach that 60 percent right
 
00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
maybe we should do just cigarettes and
 
00:37:52.150 --> 00:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:53.829 --> 00:37:53.839 align:start position:0%
pipe tobacco you know i know that you
 
00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
have five years and to me twice it was
 
00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.750 align:start position:0%
have five years and to me twice it was
definitely

00:37:57.750 --> 00:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
definitely
 
00:37:59.270 --> 00:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
all right so let's leave it like this
 
00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
and then and and then once once that has
 
00:38:03.349 --> 00:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
been refereed
 
00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
between the hhs and dra then maybe we
 
00:38:09.109 --> 00:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
can revisit this in the future
 
00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
are you okay with that representative
 
00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:12.150 align:start position:0%
are you okay with that representative
bartlett

00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
bartlett
 
00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
i have some discomfort over the fact
 
00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:15.349 align:start position:0%
i have some discomfort over the fact
that

00:38:15.349 --> 00:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
this is probably going to make it
 
00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
easier to sell more liquor
 
00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
however i don't feel like i'm in a
 
00:38:25.109 --> 00:38:25.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:25.119 --> 00:38:27.589 align:start position:0%
 
dictate

00:38:27.589 --> 00:38:27.599 align:start position:0%
dictate
 
00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
how the cigar bar stays financially
 
00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:33.839 align:start position:0%
right viable
 
00:38:33.839 --> 00:38:34.870 align:start position:0%
right viable
um

00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
like assuming we we have this whole
 
00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:40.240 align:start position:0%
statue wrapped around lodging
 
00:38:43.109 --> 00:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
we don't henry's not in the room is he
 
00:38:43.119 --> 00:38:43.990 align:start position:0%
we don't henry's not in the room is he
um

00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:46.160 align:start position:0%
but i guess we could check it but i i my
 
00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
assumption is that the lodging in the
 
00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
restaurant who really is the one that's
 
00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
most concerned
 
00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
about them you know having this liquor i
 
00:38:55.990 --> 00:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
i would assume they're happy because we
 
00:38:58.950 --> 00:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
still have not allowed them to sell food
 
00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
and and so i would assume that they
 
00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
would be happy but we can certainly i
 
00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
could check up with them before we take
 
00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
this up
 
00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:08.150 align:start position:0%
this up
okay

00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
all right uh
 
00:39:11.430 --> 00:39:11.440 align:start position:0%
anybody else have any other discussion
 
00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:12.880 align:start position:0%

00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:14.880 align:start position:0%

00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:16.880 align:start position:0%

all right so
 
00:40:36.069 --> 00:40:36.079 align:start position:0%
uh 1502 1503 and 1504 all right so as
 
00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
some of you may know just to make sure
 
00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
everybody knows what we're doing here
 
00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
um 1503 even though i scheduled it with
 
00:40:45.829 --> 00:40:45.839 align:start position:0%
the other bills
 
00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
as though um because it was a crypto
 
00:40:49.109 --> 00:40:49.119 align:start position:0%
bill and i thought really if we're going
 
00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
to talk crypto we should be be unified
 
00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
in our conversation
 
00:40:57.270 --> 00:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
with them it turns out 1503 did not have
 
00:41:00.069 --> 00:41:00.079 align:start position:0%
that evil uh fiscal note to it
 
00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
the five million dollar fiscal note and
 
00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
so therefore did not have an early
 
00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
departure date
 
00:41:08.309 --> 00:41:08.319 align:start position:0%
so it is the 1503 does not have to be
 
00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
out of this committee until february
 
00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:11.910 align:start position:0%
out of this committee until february
10th

00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
10th
 
00:41:15.109 --> 00:41:15.119 align:start position:0%
so that gives us a month to do what okay
 
00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
so 1502 is uh we already very well so we
 
00:41:20.230 --> 00:41:20.240 align:start position:0%
have 1502 and that not least 1502 and
 
00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:21.670 align:start position:0%
have 1502 and that not least 1502 and
1504

00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
1504
 
00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:22.720 align:start position:0%
okay but
 
00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
you know it still has a fiscal note is
 
00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
00:41:27.109 --> 00:41:27.119 align:start position:0%
both of these had the same fiscal note
 
00:41:29.589 --> 00:41:29.599 align:start position:0%
attached to it okay got it okay
 
00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
so what would i like to do uh if if it
 
00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
will humor of the subcommittee is that
 
00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:37.829 align:start position:0%
will humor of the subcommittee is that
1504

00:41:37.829 --> 00:41:37.839 align:start position:0%
1504
 
00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
is the one that really was the driver
 
00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
for the fiscal note because it was
 
00:41:45.349 --> 00:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
creating a separate division within the
 
00:41:47.910 --> 00:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
banking department and um i think
 
00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
everyone pretty much agrees that that's
 
00:41:51.349 --> 00:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
probably not a good idea for new
 
00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire so i would then uh entertain
 
00:41:56.470 --> 00:41:56.480 align:start position:0%
it's uh once we finish with this that we
 
00:41:58.870 --> 00:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
would want to just kill 1504 and really
 
00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
send the message that no we're not
 
00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
interested in creating that division
 
00:42:05.589 --> 00:42:05.599 align:start position:0%
the uh 1502
 
00:42:08.069 --> 00:42:08.079 align:start position:0%
um had some of the language and and then
 
00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
in 1503
 
00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:12.640 align:start position:0%
was obviously securities related
 
00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
but what we do know now is that
 
00:42:19.829 --> 00:42:19.839 align:start position:0%
we want to go forward with a ucc model
 
00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
legislation which uh theoretically in
 
00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:24.640 align:start position:0%
the next two or three years i don't know
 
00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
how many years before they officially
 
00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
announced it
 
00:42:28.550 --> 00:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
that every state is going to have the
 
00:42:31.270 --> 00:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
same similar statute so the advantages
 
00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:32.640 align:start position:0%
here is that new hampshire will be the
 
00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:33.510 align:start position:0%
here is that new hampshire will be the
first

00:42:33.510 --> 00:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
to have a ucc statute related to crypto
 
00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
and i the sense of urgency i feel about
 
00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
this is is i am i am shocked in awe
 
00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:45.200 align:start position:0%
that how many financial institutions
 
00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:46.720 align:start position:0%
already are doing it i mean i was
 
00:42:48.870 --> 00:42:48.880 align:start position:0%
looking at my paypal account and it's
 
00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
telling me yeah it's in the business of
 
00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
doing crypto um i know trust departments
 
00:42:55.589 --> 00:42:55.599 align:start position:0%
uh absolutely are
 
00:42:57.270 --> 00:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
jumping at the bit to be carrying it in
 
00:42:58.950 --> 00:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
people's portfolios
 
00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
so if that is true then that that makes
 
00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
our sense of urgency of doing the ucc
 
00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
that much more anyways is to you know to
 
00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:10.720 align:start position:0%
have that so um the plan would be today
 
00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
would be to uh dispose of 1502 and 1504
 
00:43:17.589 --> 00:43:17.599 align:start position:0%
because they're early bills
 
00:43:21.109 --> 00:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
and that way 1503 will then be the uh
 
00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
our crypto bill that we will then take
 
00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
up um by the end of the first week of
 
00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:29.910 align:start position:0%
up um by the end of the first week of
february

00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
this is the first week of february
 
00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
excuse me first week of march i'm sorry
 
00:43:35.349 --> 00:43:35.359 align:start position:0%
okay chairman
 
00:43:35.359 --> 00:43:36.230 align:start position:0%
okay chairman
yes

00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:43:39.109 --> 00:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
i think did you so i thought you were
 
00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:40.640 align:start position:0%
saying we were
 
00:43:43.750 --> 00:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
taking away 1503 and 1504 and we're
 
00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:46.160 align:start position:0%
gonna use 1502. no
 
00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:46.950 align:start position:0%
gonna use 1502. no
no

00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:46.960 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:43:49.309 --> 00:43:49.319 align:start position:0%
okay let me try again okay
 
00:43:52.309 --> 00:43:52.319 align:start position:0%
1502 i think we should interim study it
 
00:43:54.069 --> 00:43:54.079 align:start position:0%
so that we always have something that's
 
00:43:56.470 --> 00:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
in still in the committee
 
00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:58.069 align:start position:0%
in still in the committee
1503

00:43:58.069 --> 00:43:58.079 align:start position:0%
1503
 
00:43:59.510 --> 00:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
we will take up
 
00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:02.309 align:start position:0%
we will take up
march

00:44:02.309 --> 00:44:02.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:09.349 --> 00:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
1504 i think we should just dispose of
 
00:44:09.359 --> 00:44:13.670 align:start position:0%
1504 i think we should just dispose of
today

00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:15.200 align:start position:0%
this sounds good
 
00:44:18.309 --> 00:44:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:20.309 --> 00:44:20.319 align:start position:0%
yeah i i'm sorry i could have misspoke
 
00:44:23.109 --> 00:44:23.119 align:start position:0%
and obviously i spoke about the dates
 
00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:24.880 align:start position:0%

00:47:23.349 --> 00:47:23.359 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
and 1503 we're not taking up today
 
00:47:28.549 --> 00:47:28.559 align:start position:0%
because uh we're we're going to be
 
00:47:31.270 --> 00:47:31.280 align:start position:0%
holding on to that and working on that
 
00:47:33.829 --> 00:47:33.839 align:start position:0%
some more the interim study is there a
 
00:47:33.839 --> 00:47:34.710 align:start position:0%
some more the interim study is there a
time

00:47:34.710 --> 00:47:34.720 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:35.670 align:start position:0%
time
certain

00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
certain
 
00:47:38.309 --> 00:47:38.319 align:start position:0%
interim study bill if that if the house
 
00:47:40.710 --> 00:47:40.720 align:start position:0%
concurs with that motion would mean that
 
00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
we would keep that bill in committee and
 
00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
we would probably revisit it next fall
 
00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
and then by by october
 
00:47:50.309 --> 00:47:50.319 align:start position:0%
of next year
 
00:47:52.549 --> 00:47:52.559 align:start position:0%
we would have to say recommend or not
 
00:47:56.470 --> 00:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:58.870 --> 00:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
so just so i got it straight
 
00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
nothing's going to get passed until
 
00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
there's further study
 
00:48:03.589 --> 00:48:03.599 align:start position:0%
and discussion
 
00:48:06.549 --> 00:48:06.559 align:start position:0%
on the cryptocurrency issue nothing is
 
00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
good nothing we hope
 
00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
one month
 
00:48:20.309 --> 00:48:20.319 align:start position:0%
we would have an amendment for 1503.
 
00:48:22.309 --> 00:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
and in that amendment
 
00:48:24.549 --> 00:48:24.559 align:start position:0%
we'll have the agreed upon language for
 
00:48:24.559 --> 00:48:26.630 align:start position:0%
we'll have the agreed upon language for
securities

00:48:26.630 --> 00:48:26.640 align:start position:0%
securities
 
00:48:28.150 --> 00:48:28.160 align:start position:0%
and then the
 
00:48:30.390 --> 00:48:30.400 align:start position:0%
attempt to put
 
00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
create a new ucc chapter chapter 12
 
00:48:36.309 --> 00:48:36.319 align:start position:0%
that will be
 
00:48:39.910 --> 00:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
blockchain technology
 
00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
all right so um
 
00:48:45.109 --> 00:48:45.119 align:start position:0%
there is a there is the potential that
 
00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:51.910 align:start position:0%
 
blockchain

00:48:51.910 --> 00:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
blockchain
 
00:48:54.630 --> 00:48:54.640 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry yeah stay tuned that's where
 
00:48:56.710 --> 00:48:56.720 align:start position:0%
yes ucc
 
00:48:58.230 --> 00:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
we hope
 
00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
to have in front of us
 
00:49:04.150 --> 00:49:04.160 align:start position:0%
a month from now one month okay i just
 
00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
you can vote against it then chris
 
00:49:08.950 --> 00:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
you will get your chance to vote against
 
00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:09.990 align:start position:0%
you will get your chance to vote against
it

00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:49:11.190 --> 00:49:11.200 align:start position:0%
no i just
 
00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:14.390 align:start position:0%
no i just
okay

00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:15.430 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:49:15.430 --> 00:49:15.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:49:17.430 --> 00:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
any more discussion all right so oh we
 
00:49:19.670 --> 00:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
do have one more thing
 
00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
oh of course the most important
 
00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
important one right 1469.
 
00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:26.720 align:start position:0%
okay so we do have an amendment for 1469
 
00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:57.030 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:49:57.030 --> 00:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:59.910 --> 00:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:22.870 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:25.270 --> 00:50:25.280 align:start position:0%
all right so the amendment should say
 
00:50:27.430 --> 00:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
three four two have my name on it and
 
00:50:32.069 --> 00:50:32.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:37.030 --> 00:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:41.670 --> 00:50:41.680 align:start position:0%
okay uh so what uh 342 does is it uh
 
00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
basically replace the entire bill so
 
00:50:45.670 --> 00:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
we'll start with that concept we've
 
00:50:47.589 --> 00:50:47.599 align:start position:0%
replaced the entire
 
00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
00:50:52.390 --> 00:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
it changes the title to the bill
 
00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
relative prohibited acts for banks
 
00:50:56.950 --> 00:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
credit unions and businesses
 
00:50:58.950 --> 00:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
and amends the bill with two sections
 
00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
section one section two
 
00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
section one is in the banking statute
 
00:51:04.549 --> 00:51:04.559 align:start position:0%
section two is in the consumer
 
00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:16.069 --> 00:51:16.079 align:start position:0%
so brandy do you want to
 
00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:27.030 --> 00:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
and you since i'm the only one in the
 
00:51:28.230 --> 00:51:28.240 align:start position:0%
room who knows who you are you might
 
00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
yeah do you have to make sure the mic is
 
00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
on and pull it close to you
 
00:51:39.589 --> 00:51:39.599 align:start position:0%
so they can hear you at home
 
00:51:41.109 --> 00:51:41.119 align:start position:0%
yeah the button there should be a button
 
00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:46.309 --> 00:51:46.319 align:start position:0%
red is on
 
00:51:48.150 --> 00:51:48.160 align:start position:0%
camera's on there
 
00:51:49.270 --> 00:51:49.280 align:start position:0%
opposite of what they do in the
 
00:51:51.510 --> 00:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
courthouses yes
 
00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
everybody hear me okay yes
 
00:51:55.510 --> 00:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
morning members of the committee mr
 
00:51:57.430 --> 00:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
chairperson my name is brandon garad i'm
 
00:51:59.750 --> 00:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
a senior assistant attorney general uh
 
00:52:00.950 --> 00:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
also the chief of the consumer
 
00:52:02.549 --> 00:52:02.559 align:start position:0%
protection and anti-trust bureau at the
 
00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
department of justice um so i am here
 
00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
just to point out some observations
 
00:52:10.470 --> 00:52:10.480 align:start position:0%
uh that the department of justice has
 
00:52:12.390 --> 00:52:12.400 align:start position:0%
about 1469
 
00:52:14.309 --> 00:52:14.319 align:start position:0%
not to speak to the merit of the bill
 
00:52:17.270 --> 00:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
itself or the underlying intention of it
 
00:52:18.870 --> 00:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
but simply speak
 
00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:21.440 align:start position:0%
as mr chairperson you pointed out
 
00:52:23.510 --> 00:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
about 50 of this amendment would be
 
00:52:25.030 --> 00:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
placed under new hampshire's consumer
 
00:52:26.309 --> 00:52:26.319 align:start position:0%
protection act
 
00:52:28.069 --> 00:52:28.079 align:start position:0%
uh the consumer protection bureau of the
 
00:52:30.309 --> 00:52:30.319 align:start position:0%
department of justice are the enforcers
 
00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
of the consumer protection act so
 
00:52:34.630 --> 00:52:34.640 align:start position:0%
anytime something is being added or
 
00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
amended in the consumer protection act
 
00:52:39.270 --> 00:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
as the enforcer i look at it as a matter
 
00:52:40.870 --> 00:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
of enforceability
 
00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
if somebody were to file a complaint
 
00:52:44.950 --> 00:52:44.960 align:start position:0%
with our office alleging a violation of
 
00:52:47.109 --> 00:52:47.119 align:start position:0%
this statute would the department of
 
00:52:48.870 --> 00:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
justice be able to meaningfully
 
00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:50.390 align:start position:0%
justice be able to meaningfully
investigate

00:52:50.390 --> 00:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
investigate
 
00:52:52.069 --> 00:52:52.079 align:start position:0%
and determine whether or not a violation
 
00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
has occurred
 
00:52:55.270 --> 00:52:55.280 align:start position:0%
and i think there are some great
 
00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
concerns with the way that this
 
00:52:59.510 --> 00:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
amendment is currently written and that
 
00:53:02.390 --> 00:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
many complaints under or allegations
 
00:53:05.430 --> 00:53:05.440 align:start position:0%
made under uh the way this is worded now
 
00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
would largely be unenforceable by the
 
00:53:09.430 --> 00:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
department of justice now i'll give you
 
00:53:11.829 --> 00:53:11.839 align:start position:0%
an example of what i mean
 
00:53:13.589 --> 00:53:13.599 align:start position:0%
you know currently the consumer
 
00:53:15.670 --> 00:53:15.680 align:start position:0%
protection act gives us the ability when
 
00:53:17.190 --> 00:53:17.200 align:start position:0%
somebody files a complaint at the
 
00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:18.720 align:start position:0%
department of justice
 
00:53:22.150 --> 00:53:22.160 align:start position:0%
there is subpoena authority under the
 
00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act that allows us
 
00:53:25.589 --> 00:53:25.599 align:start position:0%
to investigate
 
00:53:27.349 --> 00:53:27.359 align:start position:0%
interview witnesses take testimony
 
00:53:29.670 --> 00:53:29.680 align:start position:0%
subpoena documents in order to make sure
 
00:53:31.109 --> 00:53:31.119 align:start position:0%
that if somebody's making a complaint
 
00:53:32.549 --> 00:53:32.559 align:start position:0%
against somebody before the department
 
00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:34.720 align:start position:0%
of justice is bringing civil or criminal
 
00:53:36.549 --> 00:53:36.559 align:start position:0%
charges forward we're able to
 
00:53:38.549 --> 00:53:38.559 align:start position:0%
corroborate what's being said we're able
 
00:53:40.630 --> 00:53:40.640 align:start position:0%
to build a case and we're able to
 
00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
clearly show that a violation of the
 
00:53:44.069 --> 00:53:44.079 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act has happened and
 
00:53:45.589 --> 00:53:45.599 align:start position:0%
that there are unfair and deceptive acts
 
00:53:49.349 --> 00:53:49.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:49.359 --> 00:53:50.309 align:start position:0%
 
to

00:53:50.309 --> 00:53:50.319 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:53:52.470 --> 00:53:52.480 align:start position:0%
to make it a unfair and deceptive act or
 
00:53:54.309 --> 00:53:54.319 align:start position:0%
practice to discriminate against an
 
00:53:56.950 --> 00:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
individual in the course of business
 
00:53:59.430 --> 00:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
based on these various factors absent
 
00:54:01.349 --> 00:54:01.359 align:start position:0%
some sort of written policy by the
 
00:54:01.359 --> 00:54:02.390 align:start position:0%
some sort of written policy by the
business

00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:54:03.829 --> 00:54:03.839 align:start position:0%
that the attorney general's office was
 
00:54:06.549 --> 00:54:06.559 align:start position:0%
able to subpoena and review um and
 
00:54:07.990 --> 00:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
so in that circumstance it would be
 
00:54:09.349 --> 00:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
enforceable if a business keeps a
 
00:54:10.870 --> 00:54:10.880 align:start position:0%
written policy that says you know we're
 
00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
going to treat this group of people
 
00:54:13.829 --> 00:54:13.839 align:start position:0%
different than this group of people
 
00:54:16.309 --> 00:54:16.319 align:start position:0%
right that would be enforceable we'd be
 
00:54:17.750 --> 00:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
able to subpoena the business we'd be
 
00:54:19.510 --> 00:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
able to subpoena the business owner in
 
00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
ask them about written policies ask
 
00:54:23.430 --> 00:54:23.440 align:start position:0%
employees about written policies and to
 
00:54:25.030 --> 00:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
the extent that those written policies
 
00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:27.109 align:start position:0%
the extent that those written policies
existed

00:54:27.109 --> 00:54:27.119 align:start position:0%
existed
 
00:54:28.790 --> 00:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
this would potentially be enforceable
 
00:54:31.190 --> 00:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
but absent something like that
 
00:54:32.790 --> 00:54:32.800 align:start position:0%
if a business is taking an action
 
00:54:35.589 --> 00:54:35.599 align:start position:0%
against somebody and the purpose that
 
00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
the business is behind their action is
 
00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
really the the
 
00:54:41.589 --> 00:54:41.599 align:start position:0%
employee or the business owners
 
00:54:44.950 --> 00:54:44.960 align:start position:0%
subjective intent in doing so absent a
 
00:54:47.109 --> 00:54:47.119 align:start position:0%
confession by the bad actor in that case
 
00:54:48.789 --> 00:54:48.799 align:start position:0%
that their motivation for taking the
 
00:54:50.390 --> 00:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
action that they took
 
00:54:52.470 --> 00:54:52.480 align:start position:0%
was in fact one of the factors listed in
 
00:54:54.309 --> 00:54:54.319 align:start position:0%
the statute the attorney general's
 
00:54:55.910 --> 00:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
office would be left without any
 
00:54:57.829 --> 00:54:57.839 align:start position:0%
recourse to be able to investigate to
 
00:55:00.150 --> 00:55:00.160 align:start position:0%
determine um what the underlying purpose
 
00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:02.240 align:start position:0%
of the action was
 
00:55:03.829 --> 00:55:03.839 align:start position:0%
so i just don't want to create the
 
00:55:06.470 --> 00:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
impression that if this is passed and
 
00:55:07.829 --> 00:55:07.839 align:start position:0%
complaints are made to the attorney
 
00:55:09.190 --> 00:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
general's office that this is something
 
00:55:11.109 --> 00:55:11.119 align:start position:0%
that's going to be easily investigated
 
00:55:13.030 --> 00:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
and easily prosecuted
 
00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
we take our responsibility
 
00:55:17.510 --> 00:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
in you know investigating and bringing
 
00:55:19.430 --> 00:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
charges especially criminal charges very
 
00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:20.390 align:start position:0%
charges especially criminal charges very
seriously

00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
seriously
 
00:55:21.829 --> 00:55:21.839 align:start position:0%
and we can only do so if we have
 
00:55:23.589 --> 00:55:23.599 align:start position:0%
evidence to prove beyond a reasonable
 
00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
doubt that a crime has occurred
 
00:55:28.789 --> 00:55:28.799 align:start position:0%
and in this case we would have to prove
 
00:55:31.190 --> 00:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
not only that an action took place
 
00:55:33.109 --> 00:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
some sort of discriminatory act taken
 
00:55:34.710 --> 00:55:34.720 align:start position:0%
against a customer in the course of
 
00:55:37.109 --> 00:55:37.119 align:start position:0%
business but that the underlying purpose
 
00:55:39.510 --> 00:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
of that action was in fact to
 
00:55:42.390 --> 00:55:42.400 align:start position:0%
discriminate based on any of the factors
 
00:55:44.470 --> 00:55:44.480 align:start position:0%
that are listed in the statute so it's
 
00:55:46.630 --> 00:55:46.640 align:start position:0%
not just enough that an act takes place
 
00:55:48.630 --> 00:55:48.640 align:start position:0%
but we would have to prove
 
00:55:50.309 --> 00:55:50.319 align:start position:0%
beyond a reasonable doubt in a criminal
 
00:55:50.319 --> 00:55:51.430 align:start position:0%
beyond a reasonable doubt in a criminal
case

00:55:51.430 --> 00:55:51.440 align:start position:0%
case
 
00:55:53.109 --> 00:55:53.119 align:start position:0%
and by preponderance of the evidence in
 
00:55:55.270 --> 00:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
a civil case that the purpose behind
 
00:55:58.069 --> 00:55:58.079 align:start position:0%
that action was in fact because of an
 
00:55:58.079 --> 00:55:59.829 align:start position:0%
that action was in fact because of an
individual's

00:55:59.829 --> 00:55:59.839 align:start position:0%
individual's
 
00:56:03.030 --> 00:56:03.040 align:start position:0%
political affiliations or philosophical
 
00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:04.150 align:start position:0%
political affiliations or philosophical
ideas

00:56:04.150 --> 00:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
ideas
 
00:56:06.789 --> 00:56:06.799 align:start position:0%
and there's no real way to do that
 
00:56:09.109 --> 00:56:09.119 align:start position:0%
unless it's either in writing or the
 
00:56:10.309 --> 00:56:10.319 align:start position:0%
person is willing to give a full
 
00:56:12.390 --> 00:56:12.400 align:start position:0%
confession and say you know this was my
 
00:56:14.069 --> 00:56:14.079 align:start position:0%
intention i'm happy to take a question
 
00:56:15.589 --> 00:56:15.599 align:start position:0%
okay so before i take this question
 
00:56:16.630 --> 00:56:16.640 align:start position:0%
because i'm pretty sure i know where
 
00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:18.640 align:start position:0%
he's going so i just want to ask this
 
00:56:20.630 --> 00:56:20.640 align:start position:0%
question of you sure would you believe
 
00:56:22.630 --> 00:56:22.640 align:start position:0%
that this legislation is built around
 
00:56:26.549 --> 00:56:26.559 align:start position:0%
someone actually publicly admitting
 
00:56:28.230 --> 00:56:28.240 align:start position:0%
that they are
 
00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
uh discriminating for instance deutsche
 
00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:33.440 align:start position:0%
bank said that they refused to do loans
 
00:56:35.430 --> 00:56:35.440 align:start position:0%
with the trump
 
00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:37.430 align:start position:0%
with the trump
company

00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
company
 
00:56:39.589 --> 00:56:39.599 align:start position:0%
if some so if a business were to admit
 
00:56:41.190 --> 00:56:41.200 align:start position:0%
to a practice like that and this statute
 
00:56:43.510 --> 00:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
wasn't in fact sure we would be able to
 
00:56:46.069 --> 00:56:46.079 align:start position:0%
enforce it in that limited circumstance
 
00:56:48.150 --> 00:56:48.160 align:start position:0%
but that would basically be the only
 
00:56:50.549 --> 00:56:50.559 align:start position:0%
circumstance exactly i would i just said
 
00:56:51.910 --> 00:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
would you believe this legislation
 
00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
intent is really people really are going
 
00:56:56.549 --> 00:56:56.559 align:start position:0%
to be public about their discrimination
 
00:56:58.710 --> 00:56:58.720 align:start position:0%
and that's what we really want to make
 
00:57:00.710 --> 00:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
sure it does not occur yeah i understood
 
00:57:03.270 --> 00:57:03.280 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to you know i i imagine
 
00:57:05.990 --> 00:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
that if this legislation were to pass
 
00:57:07.990 --> 00:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
um what would happen
 
00:57:09.829 --> 00:57:09.839 align:start position:0%
is that we would receive a lot of
 
00:57:11.430 --> 00:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
complaints from people that felt that
 
00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
they were treated unfairly in the course
 
00:57:15.990 --> 00:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
of business throughout the state um and
 
00:57:18.230 --> 00:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
that that was as a result of their
 
00:57:20.630 --> 00:57:20.640 align:start position:0%
personal ideologies political beliefs
 
00:57:22.950 --> 00:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
facebook posts whatever have you and you
 
00:57:25.109 --> 00:57:25.119 align:start position:0%
know if we look at that complaint and
 
00:57:26.630 --> 00:57:26.640 align:start position:0%
it's a business that hasn't made any
 
00:57:28.710 --> 00:57:28.720 align:start position:0%
public statements right about you're
 
00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
discriminating against a certain class
 
00:57:31.990 --> 00:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
of people or a certain group of people
 
00:57:33.670 --> 00:57:33.680 align:start position:0%
and we reach out to the business and say
 
00:57:35.589 --> 00:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
hey can you respond to this complaint
 
00:57:38.150 --> 00:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
and they say no we're not going to
 
00:57:40.069 --> 00:57:40.079 align:start position:0%
that ends our ability to investigate
 
00:57:42.549 --> 00:57:42.559 align:start position:0%
that type of complaint so i think those
 
00:57:44.230 --> 00:57:44.240 align:start position:0%
concerns uh
 
00:57:46.549 --> 00:57:46.559 align:start position:0%
to the extent that you know
 
00:57:48.549 --> 00:57:48.559 align:start position:0%
that type of enforceability can be
 
00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:50.960 align:start position:0%
tightened up or can be drafted in a way
 
00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
where the attorney general's office
 
00:57:54.950 --> 00:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
would be able to
 
00:57:57.349 --> 00:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
take enforcement action or investigate
 
00:57:59.109 --> 00:57:59.119 align:start position:0%
those types of complaints i think that's
 
00:58:00.950 --> 00:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
a concern that the committee should
 
00:58:02.309 --> 00:58:02.319 align:start position:0%
think so
 
00:58:05.589 --> 00:58:05.599 align:start position:0%
obviously one of the other uh
 
00:58:09.510 --> 00:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
what do i say avenues of resolution to a
 
00:58:12.950 --> 00:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
statute is the right of private action
 
00:58:14.549 --> 00:58:14.559 align:start position:0%
so i'm sure there are plenty of times
 
00:58:16.870 --> 00:58:16.880 align:start position:0%
you have said to people who called and
 
00:58:18.789 --> 00:58:18.799 align:start position:0%
complained listen we're never going to
 
00:58:20.069 --> 00:58:20.079 align:start position:0%
be able you know unless you've got a
 
00:58:22.150 --> 00:58:22.160 align:start position:0%
smoking gun there's nothing we can do
 
00:58:23.829 --> 00:58:23.839 align:start position:0%
but you there's nothing stopping you
 
00:58:25.349 --> 00:58:25.359 align:start position:0%
from suing
 
00:58:26.710 --> 00:58:26.720 align:start position:0%
that business
 
00:58:29.270 --> 00:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
that is true mr chairperson but you know
 
00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:30.069 align:start position:0%
that is true mr chairperson but you know
we

00:58:30.069 --> 00:58:30.079 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:58:32.630 --> 00:58:32.640 align:start position:0%
are the authority on consumer protection
 
00:58:34.789 --> 00:58:34.799 align:start position:0%
in the state and the public looks to us
 
00:58:36.630 --> 00:58:36.640 align:start position:0%
to enforce the consumer protection act
 
00:58:39.109 --> 00:58:39.119 align:start position:0%
so we certainly want to be in a position
 
00:58:40.710 --> 00:58:40.720 align:start position:0%
to enforce it whenever there is a
 
00:58:42.390 --> 00:58:42.400 align:start position:0%
violation and there are unfair and
 
00:58:45.190 --> 00:58:45.200 align:start position:0%
deceptive acts of practice is occurring
 
00:58:46.950 --> 00:58:46.960 align:start position:0%
i don't want to be in a situation where
 
00:58:49.190 --> 00:58:49.200 align:start position:0%
we're receiving an onslaught of
 
00:58:51.430 --> 00:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
complaints and we have to continually
 
00:58:54.069 --> 00:58:54.079 align:start position:0%
tell consumers you know this is
 
00:58:55.270 --> 00:58:55.280 align:start position:0%
simply not enough evidence there's
 
00:58:56.870 --> 00:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
nothing we can do at that point it looks
 
00:58:59.430 --> 00:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
like you know your the people's consumer
 
00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
protection bureau has failed them and
 
00:59:02.710 --> 00:59:02.720 align:start position:0%
it's telling them to you know go to
 
00:59:04.549 --> 00:59:04.559 align:start position:0%
court and do it yourself we don't like
 
00:59:06.069 --> 00:59:06.079 align:start position:0%
to be in that position no i i hear you i
 
00:59:08.470 --> 00:59:08.480 align:start position:0%
hear you but i i guess i i guess i'm i'm
 
00:59:10.710 --> 00:59:10.720 align:start position:0%
i'm not i'm not sure that is going to
 
00:59:13.510 --> 00:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
occur so but i hear you and that you
 
00:59:15.270 --> 00:59:15.280 align:start position:0%
know if we if we did see this an
 
00:59:17.270 --> 00:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
overwhelming problem then i you know i'd
 
00:59:19.349 --> 00:59:19.359 align:start position:0%
say yes we probably could say something
 
00:59:21.270 --> 00:59:21.280 align:start position:0%
to to people like don't please don't
 
00:59:23.670 --> 00:59:23.680 align:start position:0%
bother us if you don't have evidence but
 
00:59:26.230 --> 00:59:26.240 align:start position:0%
um at this point i i don't you know we
 
00:59:28.230 --> 00:59:28.240 align:start position:0%
have to we have to assume that people
 
00:59:30.230 --> 00:59:30.240 align:start position:0%
that the the intent of the legislation
 
00:59:32.710 --> 00:59:32.720 align:start position:0%
is from the sponsors is that is that
 
00:59:33.910 --> 00:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:59:36.309 --> 00:59:36.319 align:start position:0%
uh that the these guilty parties will be
 
00:59:38.549 --> 00:59:38.559 align:start position:0%
public about their position that they
 
00:59:40.950 --> 00:59:40.960 align:start position:0%
are they've been publicly
 
00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:41.829 align:start position:0%
are they've been publicly
uh

00:59:41.829 --> 00:59:41.839 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:59:44.309 --> 00:59:44.319 align:start position:0%
i don't say browbeated into doing that
 
00:59:46.309 --> 00:59:46.319 align:start position:0%
so we want to just make on record that
 
00:59:49.109 --> 00:59:49.119 align:start position:0%
we don't want that to happen
 
00:59:51.510 --> 00:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative terry
 
00:59:54.230 --> 00:59:54.240 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman so first if i
 
00:59:55.750 --> 00:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
may ask a question of you
 
00:59:59.109 --> 00:59:59.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:00.950 --> 01:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
i i understand that in a couple of
 
01:00:02.710 --> 01:00:02.720 align:start position:0%
different ways one is that it's out in
 
01:00:05.109 --> 01:00:05.119 align:start position:0%
the open for people to see right or
 
01:00:07.030 --> 01:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
public do you mean by publicly that it's
 
01:00:09.750 --> 01:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
actually a stated policy it had he had a
 
01:00:12.789 --> 01:00:12.799 align:start position:0%
you you mean state of health yes okay so
 
01:00:15.910 --> 01:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
because public means it's in view
 
01:00:18.630 --> 01:00:18.640 align:start position:0%
uh stated it can also mean that yes you
 
01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
mean stated all right so i have a
 
01:00:22.630 --> 01:00:22.640 align:start position:0%
question for the yes okay sir thank you
 
01:00:25.589 --> 01:00:25.599 align:start position:0%
so um i understand what you're saying i
 
01:00:27.670 --> 01:00:27.680 align:start position:0%
think i understand what you're saying
 
01:00:29.870 --> 01:00:29.880 align:start position:0%
with respect to
 
01:00:35.109 --> 01:00:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:37.270 --> 01:00:37.280 align:start position:0%
would it be enough though
 
01:00:39.589 --> 01:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
if a company did not
 
01:00:43.030 --> 01:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
advertise or state publicly
 
01:00:44.950 --> 01:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
a particular
 
01:00:47.430 --> 01:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
potentially discriminatory practice
 
01:00:49.589 --> 01:00:49.599 align:start position:0%
would it be enough for the department if
 
01:00:52.630 --> 01:00:52.640 align:start position:0%
it observed a pattern
 
01:00:54.950 --> 01:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
potentially i mean that is that is a
 
01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
method that we
 
01:00:58.870 --> 01:00:58.880 align:start position:0%
use in evaluating consumer complaints
 
01:00:58.880 --> 01:00:59.829 align:start position:0%
use in evaluating consumer complaints
follow

01:00:59.829 --> 01:00:59.839 align:start position:0%
follow
 
01:01:02.230 --> 01:01:02.240 align:start position:0%
so that now would not require subpoena
 
01:01:03.670 --> 01:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
power that would
 
01:01:04.630 --> 01:01:04.640 align:start position:0%
all you
 
01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
all you'd have to see would be a
 
01:01:09.750 --> 01:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
pattern of behavior that suggested
 
01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:12.150 align:start position:0%
pattern of behavior that suggested
discrimination

01:01:12.150 --> 01:01:12.160 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
01:01:15.349 --> 01:01:15.359 align:start position:0%
if it was a consistent enough and a
 
01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
continuous enough pattern there is a
 
01:01:19.829 --> 01:01:19.839 align:start position:0%
possibility that that could lead to
 
01:01:21.910 --> 01:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
enough for us to move forward yes but it
 
01:01:23.910 --> 01:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
would all depend on you know the
 
01:01:25.589 --> 01:01:25.599 align:start position:0%
complaints would have to be very similar
 
01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
and they would have to be you know
 
01:01:29.510 --> 01:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
so that would be in addition to
 
01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
something stated
 
01:01:33.030 --> 01:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
yes yes another criteria or data point
 
01:01:35.589 --> 01:01:35.599 align:start position:0%
representative greeson
 
01:01:37.270 --> 01:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr and thank you for answering
 
01:01:39.430 --> 01:01:39.440 align:start position:0%
our questions uh how many businesses
 
01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
have written policies to discriminate
 
01:01:43.270 --> 01:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
against any of the other protected
 
01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:44.309 align:start position:0%
against any of the other protected
groups

01:01:44.309 --> 01:01:44.319 align:start position:0%
groups
 
01:01:45.670 --> 01:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
i i can't
 
01:01:47.109 --> 01:01:47.119 align:start position:0%
discriminate and answer that question
 
01:01:48.789 --> 01:01:48.799 align:start position:0%
this morning unfortunately and does
 
01:01:50.549 --> 01:01:50.559 align:start position:0%
discrimination still occur despite
 
01:01:52.150 --> 01:01:52.160 align:start position:0%
having laws on the books that say thou
 
01:01:53.910 --> 01:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
shalt not discriminate
 
01:01:57.029 --> 01:01:57.039 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry can you repeat your question
 
01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
does discrimination still occur
 
01:02:02.789 --> 01:02:02.799 align:start position:0%
does any discrimination occur
 
01:02:04.950 --> 01:02:04.960 align:start position:0%
a discrimination of course occurs and
 
01:02:06.630 --> 01:02:06.640 align:start position:0%
and when you investigate this
 
01:02:08.309 --> 01:02:08.319 align:start position:0%
discrimination how many of those places
 
01:02:09.829 --> 01:02:09.839 align:start position:0%
that were alleged to have discriminated
 
01:02:11.270 --> 01:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
have on their paul in their books a
 
01:02:13.270 --> 01:02:13.280 align:start position:0%
policy written policy that you know
 
01:02:15.270 --> 01:02:15.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to discriminate against
 
01:02:16.710 --> 01:02:16.720 align:start position:0%
x y or z group
 
01:02:20.069 --> 01:02:20.079 align:start position:0%
discrimination is not currently a part
 
01:02:22.230 --> 01:02:22.240 align:start position:0%
of the consumer protection act so we do
 
01:02:24.630 --> 01:02:24.640 align:start position:0%
not do we do have a civil rights bureau
 
01:02:26.069 --> 01:02:26.079 align:start position:0%
in the attorney general's office human
 
01:02:27.990 --> 01:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
rights commission yes but what i want to
 
01:02:29.990 --> 01:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
say he mentioned earlier
 
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.990 align:start position:0%
say he mentioned earlier
that

01:02:31.990 --> 01:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:02:34.390 --> 01:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
it would have to be in a businesses
 
01:02:35.910 --> 01:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
written policy that they're going to
 
01:02:37.430 --> 01:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
discriminate against in order to be
 
01:02:39.270 --> 01:02:39.280 align:start position:0%
enforceable this act or written it
 
01:02:40.470 --> 01:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be a written policy it
 
01:02:42.230 --> 01:02:42.240 align:start position:0%
could be a it could be an advertised
 
01:02:44.230 --> 01:02:44.240 align:start position:0%
policy it could be a pattern i'm i'm
 
01:02:47.109 --> 01:02:47.119 align:start position:0%
using his words i know but that's that's
 
01:02:49.349 --> 01:02:49.359 align:start position:0%
but how many businesses have a written
 
01:02:51.270 --> 01:02:51.280 align:start position:0%
policy to discriminate
 
01:02:52.870 --> 01:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
but again i can't answer that question i
 
01:02:54.549 --> 01:02:54.559 align:start position:0%
haven't survived obviously the answer is
 
01:02:54.559 --> 01:02:57.270 align:start position:0%
haven't survived obviously the answer is
none

01:02:57.270 --> 01:02:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:57.280 --> 01:02:58.230 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:02:58.230 --> 01:02:58.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:03:00.950 --> 01:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
representative rose
 
01:03:03.670 --> 01:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
i have a quick question um on line 28
 
01:03:04.950 --> 01:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
and i don't know if i'm asking this to
 
01:03:07.829 --> 01:03:07.839 align:start position:0%
you mr chair um it says that when such
 
01:03:09.589 --> 01:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
action is necessary for the physical
 
01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
safety of the person the business or the
 
01:03:13.910 --> 01:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
business employees should there be
 
01:03:15.589 --> 01:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
something in there that would also
 
01:03:15.599 --> 01:03:16.390 align:start position:0%
something in there that would also
protect

01:03:16.390 --> 01:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
protect
 
01:03:18.309 --> 01:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
the public
 
01:03:20.150 --> 01:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
if the public would be
 
01:03:25.670 --> 01:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:30.710 --> 01:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:32.150 --> 01:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
if somebody if somebody on let's say
 
01:03:34.230 --> 01:03:34.240 align:start position:0%
okay i'll give you a what if somebody is
 
01:03:38.309 --> 01:03:38.319 align:start position:0%
on social media advocating a um 911 type
 
01:03:39.990 --> 01:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
attack in new hampshire
 
01:03:41.349 --> 01:03:41.359 align:start position:0%
with that
 
01:03:43.750 --> 01:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
i mean that's an extreme but is there is
 
01:03:46.150 --> 01:03:46.160 align:start position:0%
there cause to put into also to protect
 
01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:50.710 --> 01:03:50.720 align:start position:0%
representation you wrote this do you
 
01:03:56.630 --> 01:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:01.109 --> 01:04:01.119 align:start position:0%
in in discussions with the with the um
 
01:04:02.470 --> 01:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
with the
 
01:04:04.390 --> 01:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
bankers association
 
01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:06.870 align:start position:0%
bankers association
uh

01:04:06.870 --> 01:04:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:09.750 --> 01:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
there may be an a need to
 
01:04:13.430 --> 01:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
protect the employees of that business
 
01:04:16.150 --> 01:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
from physical harm
 
01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:04:20.230 --> 01:04:20.240 align:start position:0%
that's where this comes in
 
01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:22.069 align:start position:0%
that's where this comes in
okay

01:04:22.069 --> 01:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:04:25.270 --> 01:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
as far as protecting the public
 
01:04:27.829 --> 01:04:27.839 align:start position:0%
you're talking about a criminal
 
01:04:27.839 --> 01:04:29.190 align:start position:0%
you're talking about a criminal
act

01:04:29.190 --> 01:04:29.200 align:start position:0%
act
 
01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:31.589 align:start position:0%
act
and

01:04:31.589 --> 01:04:31.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:34.230 --> 01:04:34.240 align:start position:0%
that then becomes a different issue
 
01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:35.990 align:start position:0%
that then becomes a different issue
entirely

01:04:35.990 --> 01:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
entirely
 
01:04:38.710 --> 01:04:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:41.430 --> 01:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
this is not dealing with
 
01:04:43.910 --> 01:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
criminal action in that regard so no
 
01:04:47.029 --> 01:04:47.039 align:start position:0%
it's not necessary in the context uh if
 
01:04:49.349 --> 01:04:49.359 align:start position:0%
somebody goes out and says i am going to
 
01:04:51.510 --> 01:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
do something at this particular bank
 
01:04:55.349 --> 01:04:55.359 align:start position:0%
because of x y or z uh then they that
 
01:04:57.270 --> 01:04:57.280 align:start position:0%
that bank would have the ability to say
 
01:04:58.470 --> 01:04:58.480 align:start position:0%
we're not going to do business with that
 
01:05:01.109 --> 01:05:01.119 align:start position:0%
guy because of of clear threats against
 
01:05:04.710 --> 01:05:04.720 align:start position:0%
specific uh that bank but just general
 
01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:06.150 align:start position:0%
specific uh that bank but just general
stupidity

01:05:06.150 --> 01:05:06.160 align:start position:0%
stupidity
 
01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:06.950 align:start position:0%
stupidity
uh

01:05:06.950 --> 01:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
you know threats to the public how would
 
01:05:10.549 --> 01:05:10.559 align:start position:0%
you define that but if there's any
 
01:05:12.069 --> 01:05:12.079 align:start position:0%
credible threats that becomes a police
 
01:05:15.270 --> 01:05:15.280 align:start position:0%
matter and not the business itself
 
01:05:18.309 --> 01:05:18.319 align:start position:0%
okay representative herbert
 
01:05:18.319 --> 01:05:19.829 align:start position:0%
okay representative herbert
um

01:05:19.829 --> 01:05:19.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:19.839 --> 01:05:20.710 align:start position:0%
um
my

01:05:20.710 --> 01:05:20.720 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:05:22.789 --> 01:05:22.799 align:start position:0%
i'm not inclined to
 
01:05:25.029 --> 01:05:25.039 align:start position:0%
support this bill anyway but
 
01:05:27.670 --> 01:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
01:05:29.190 --> 01:05:29.200 align:start position:0%
haven't there been
 
01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:31.190 align:start position:0%
haven't there been
rulings

01:05:31.190 --> 01:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
rulings
 
01:05:33.829 --> 01:05:33.839 align:start position:0%
what was it hobby lobby
 
01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
where some businesses do discriminate
 
01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:37.430 align:start position:0%
where some businesses do discriminate
have

01:05:37.430 --> 01:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:05:39.750 --> 01:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
and they have been allowed to legally
 
01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:41.109 align:start position:0%
and they have been allowed to legally
discriminate

01:05:41.109 --> 01:05:41.119 align:start position:0%
discriminate
 
01:05:43.990 --> 01:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
so i i'm a little confused here in terms
 
01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.109 align:start position:0%
so i i'm a little confused here in terms
of

01:05:45.109 --> 01:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:05:45.119 --> 01:05:46.750 align:start position:0%
of
uh

01:05:46.750 --> 01:05:46.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:05:49.190 --> 01:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination what's i mean hobby
 
01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:50.150 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination what's i mean hobby
lobbies

01:05:50.150 --> 01:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
lobbies
 
01:05:54.150 --> 01:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
was that a national uh law of some sort
 
01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
because they didn't they didn't want to
 
01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:57.109 align:start position:0%
because they didn't they didn't want to
uh

01:05:57.109 --> 01:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:05:59.109 --> 01:05:59.119 align:start position:0%
i can't remember yeah i'm not sure what
 
01:06:00.549 --> 01:06:00.559 align:start position:0%
you're referring to but but at this
 
01:06:02.390 --> 01:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
point we're just dealing with what's in
 
01:06:03.510 --> 01:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
front of us
 
01:06:04.950 --> 01:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
01:06:07.510 --> 01:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
i'm just saying i i'm a little confused
 
01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:08.789 align:start position:0%
i'm just saying i i'm a little confused
because

01:06:08.789 --> 01:06:08.799 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:06:12.069 --> 01:06:12.079 align:start position:0%
it has already been done okay well we
 
01:06:13.270 --> 01:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
understand all right representative
 
01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:14.390 align:start position:0%
understand all right representative

01:06:14.390 --> 01:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
bartlett
 
01:06:16.150 --> 01:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair so i've got a
 
01:06:17.670 --> 01:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
question um
 
01:06:19.750 --> 01:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
if a bank decides that they're not going
 
01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:20.710 align:start position:0%
if a bank decides that they're not going
to

01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:20.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:06:23.910 --> 01:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:25.829 --> 01:06:25.839 align:start position:0%
loan money to
 
01:06:28.789 --> 01:06:28.799 align:start position:0%
a fossil fuel producer
 
01:06:31.270 --> 01:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
without this law
 
01:06:33.670 --> 01:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
but would this actually would this bill
 
01:06:36.069 --> 01:06:36.079 align:start position:0%
if it became law
 
01:06:38.549 --> 01:06:38.559 align:start position:0%
allow you to
 
01:06:38.559 --> 01:06:39.589 align:start position:0%
allow you to
enforce

01:06:39.589 --> 01:06:39.599 align:start position:0%
enforce
 
01:06:42.630 --> 01:06:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:44.630 --> 01:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
well in your hypothetical a bank has
 
01:06:47.190 --> 01:06:47.200 align:start position:0%
decided not to loan to a fossil fuel
 
01:06:49.990 --> 01:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
producer is it simply because they're a
 
01:06:52.549 --> 01:06:52.559 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel producer yes they've decided
 
01:06:54.710 --> 01:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
that i mean there's certain universities
 
01:06:56.470 --> 01:06:56.480 align:start position:0%
there's certain
 
01:06:58.870 --> 01:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
foundations that are not investing in
 
01:07:01.430 --> 01:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel but if a fossil fuel
 
01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:03.029 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel but if a fossil fuel
producer

01:07:03.029 --> 01:07:03.039 align:start position:0%
producer
 
01:07:03.039 --> 01:07:04.789 align:start position:0%
producer
came

01:07:04.789 --> 01:07:04.799 align:start position:0%
came
 
01:07:06.150 --> 01:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
came to a bank and said i want to borrow
 
01:07:07.910 --> 01:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
money and they said no our policy is
 
01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:10.640 align:start position:0%
that we're not going to
 
01:07:13.109 --> 01:07:13.119 align:start position:0%
loan money to a fossil fuel producer
 
01:07:15.270 --> 01:07:15.280 align:start position:0%
would you need this law in order to be
 
01:07:16.390 --> 01:07:16.400 align:start position:0%
able to
 
01:07:19.589 --> 01:07:19.599 align:start position:0%
um keep them from disre discriminating
 
01:07:22.950 --> 01:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
so it's a it's a complicated question
 
01:07:25.910 --> 01:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
assuming that it was a discrimination by
 
01:07:27.589 --> 01:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
the bank
 
01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
that fits one of the factors in this
 
01:07:32.549 --> 01:07:32.559 align:start position:0%
statute yes this would allow us in that
 
01:07:35.430 --> 01:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
circumstance to investigate
 
01:07:36.630 --> 01:07:36.640 align:start position:0%
but again
 
01:07:38.470 --> 01:07:38.480 align:start position:0%
you know it i assume that a lot of
 
01:07:40.549 --> 01:07:40.559 align:start position:0%
decisions go into you know
 
01:07:42.789 --> 01:07:42.799 align:start position:0%
significant business decisions like that
 
01:07:45.270 --> 01:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
um we could ask the bank you know
 
01:07:46.630 --> 01:07:46.640 align:start position:0%
we've received this report from this
 
01:07:48.870 --> 01:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
company you've been denied uh they
 
01:07:51.109 --> 01:07:51.119 align:start position:0%
believe it's discrimination you simply
 
01:07:52.710 --> 01:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
are making a political statement about
 
01:07:54.630 --> 01:07:54.640 align:start position:0%
your your your disbelief in the business
 
01:07:56.549 --> 01:07:56.559 align:start position:0%
that they do what's your position
 
01:07:58.390 --> 01:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
if the bank says no you know it was
 
01:08:01.270 --> 01:08:01.280 align:start position:0%
largely a financial decision on our part
 
01:08:03.430 --> 01:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
we don't have the ability to then do any
 
01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:04.799 align:start position:0%
further investigation to show that
 
01:08:06.390 --> 01:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
that's not actually the case because
 
01:08:07.910 --> 01:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
what happened was a decision within the
 
01:08:09.990 --> 01:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
inner workings of somebody's mind and
 
01:08:11.190 --> 01:08:11.200 align:start position:0%
this is kind of the example that i'm
 
01:08:12.230 --> 01:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
here to
 
01:08:14.710 --> 01:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
point out to you you know if if the bank
 
01:08:16.309 --> 01:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
said to us oh yeah you know we
 
01:08:17.829 --> 01:08:17.839 align:start position:0%
definitely don't want to do business
 
01:08:19.829 --> 01:08:19.839 align:start position:0%
with any fossil fuel producers and we
 
01:08:21.030 --> 01:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
won't do it and we intend to
 
01:08:22.950 --> 01:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
discriminate against them in the future
 
01:08:24.789 --> 01:08:24.799 align:start position:0%
then yes that would be a violation of
 
01:08:27.189 --> 01:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
this but you know
 
01:08:29.110 --> 01:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
unless there is a full confession you
 
01:08:31.030 --> 01:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
know yes we made this decision and yes
 
01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
this was the motivation behind the
 
01:08:35.110 --> 01:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
decision that we made this is very very
 
01:08:37.189 --> 01:08:37.199 align:start position:0%
difficult to enforce so but i actually
 
01:08:38.950 --> 01:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
want to respond too because there's two
 
01:08:40.229 --> 01:08:40.239 align:start position:0%
ways to look at this question you
 
01:08:41.669 --> 01:08:41.679 align:start position:0%
actually brought up two different type
 
01:08:44.950 --> 01:08:44.960 align:start position:0%
of models one is if a a higher
 
01:08:48.789 --> 01:08:48.799 align:start position:0%
institution decides to divest
 
01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
in a stock
 
01:08:52.309 --> 01:08:52.319 align:start position:0%
okay uh and they have made that
 
01:08:54.550 --> 01:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
motivation that actually is permitted in
 
01:08:56.709 --> 01:08:56.719 align:start position:0%
this statute so your investment
 
01:09:00.149 --> 01:09:00.159 align:start position:0%
decisions and investing in something is
 
01:09:02.309 --> 01:09:02.319 align:start position:0%
perfectly permitted right okay so
 
01:09:04.309 --> 01:09:04.319 align:start position:0%
there's nothing barring you know harvard
 
01:09:07.669 --> 01:09:07.679 align:start position:0%
from selling its oil stocks okay now the
 
01:09:10.950 --> 01:09:10.960 align:start position:0%
next question was is if a bank were to
 
01:09:14.229 --> 01:09:14.239 align:start position:0%
say we are not going to loan money
 
01:09:14.239 --> 01:09:15.110 align:start position:0%
say we are not going to loan money
to

01:09:15.110 --> 01:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:09:18.550 --> 01:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
um somebody who's in the oil business
 
01:09:20.550 --> 01:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
okay we decided went on to do it
 
01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
well that wouldn't go to his department
 
01:09:25.110 --> 01:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
that would go to amelia's department and
 
01:09:27.990 --> 01:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
when milia would have to say to the bank
 
01:09:31.590 --> 01:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
what is your rationale
 
01:09:33.510 --> 01:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
they would have to document to the bank
 
01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:34.709 align:start position:0%
they would have to document to the bank
department

01:09:34.709 --> 01:09:34.719 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:09:37.590 --> 01:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
why they have created that exclusion and
 
01:09:41.590 --> 01:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
if they say we have decided through our
 
01:09:46.070 --> 01:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
evidence that they are a bad investment
 
01:09:47.910 --> 01:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
and we have documented where we have
 
01:09:50.789 --> 01:09:50.799 align:start position:0%
cases where they the company uh failed
 
01:09:53.349 --> 01:09:53.359 align:start position:0%
to to uh pay their loan they had
 
01:09:55.510 --> 01:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
structural problems or whatever that if
 
01:09:57.510 --> 01:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
they can make that example that the
 
01:10:00.070 --> 01:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
banking that financial institution can
 
01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
make a case
 
01:10:03.910 --> 01:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
that that decision they're making
 
01:10:05.590 --> 01:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
is based upon
 
01:10:09.350 --> 01:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
past history of loans in that category
 
01:10:11.669 --> 01:10:11.679 align:start position:0%
then it would be permitted so
 
01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
this law is going to keep
 
01:10:17.990 --> 01:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
would would potentially keep banks or
 
01:10:19.270 --> 01:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
credit unions
 
01:10:21.110 --> 01:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
or businesses
 
01:10:23.110 --> 01:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
from being able to set their own policy
 
01:10:24.950 --> 01:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
is that correct no it just reaffirms
 
01:10:28.229 --> 01:10:28.239 align:start position:0%
that that they better have a rationale
 
01:10:31.669 --> 01:10:31.679 align:start position:0%
for that policy just like insurance
 
01:10:35.590 --> 01:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
company can't do use credit scoring
 
01:10:37.750 --> 01:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
unless they can document that credit
 
01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
scoring is a direct effect on your
 
01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:41.510 align:start position:0%
scoring is a direct effect on your
ability

01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
ability
 
01:10:47.669 --> 01:10:47.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:53.669 --> 01:10:53.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:55.669 --> 01:10:55.679 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair thank you for
 
01:10:57.430 --> 01:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:10:57.440 --> 01:10:59.110 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

01:10:59.110 --> 01:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:01.110 --> 01:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
if it's a business decision then it's a
 
01:11:02.709 --> 01:11:02.719 align:start position:0%
business decision it's not
 
01:11:07.270 --> 01:11:07.280 align:start position:0%
discrimination can you expand on that
 
01:11:09.030 --> 01:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
can i expand on that i mean can you i
 
01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:10.870 align:start position:0%
can i expand on that i mean can you i
mean

01:11:10.870 --> 01:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
mean
 
01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
like if i owned a business and i didn't
 
01:11:14.470 --> 01:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
want to do business with someone because
 
01:11:16.310 --> 01:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not
 
01:11:18.790 --> 01:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
a good business decision then a bank
 
01:11:22.070 --> 01:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
could decide not to you know work with a
 
01:11:24.149 --> 01:11:24.159 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel company because it's you
 
01:11:26.470 --> 01:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
know not a good business decision
 
01:11:28.790 --> 01:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
so i i think what you're pointing out
 
01:11:31.189 --> 01:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
again highlights the enforceability
 
01:11:34.149 --> 01:11:34.159 align:start position:0%
problems here which is that even once if
 
01:11:35.990 --> 01:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
this is passed and this is a law in the
 
01:11:37.990 --> 01:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire businesses still
 
01:11:40.470 --> 01:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
get to make those decisions based on you
 
01:11:42.550 --> 01:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
know legitimate business factors that
 
01:11:43.830 --> 01:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
aren't purely motivated by a
 
01:11:46.390 --> 01:11:46.400 align:start position:0%
discriminatory purpose and what the
 
01:11:47.510 --> 01:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office and the
 
01:11:49.430 --> 01:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
banking commission would have to do in
 
01:11:51.510 --> 01:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
investigating these types of reports is
 
01:11:54.149 --> 01:11:54.159 align:start position:0%
determine conclusively by sufficient
 
01:11:57.189 --> 01:11:57.199 align:start position:0%
evidence whether a specific decision was
 
01:12:00.470 --> 01:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
purely discriminatory or was in some way
 
01:12:02.790 --> 01:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
motivated by um a sound business
 
01:12:04.950 --> 01:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
decision or a sound business practice
 
01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
unrelated to discrimination and you know
 
01:12:09.270 --> 01:12:09.280 align:start position:0%
the the reason coming for the committee
 
01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:10.390 align:start position:0%
the the reason coming for the committee
today

01:12:10.390 --> 01:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:12:11.910 --> 01:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
is to point out that
 
01:12:14.630 --> 01:12:14.640 align:start position:0%
absent very rare circumstances where
 
01:12:16.790 --> 01:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
there either is a written policy or an
 
01:12:18.950 --> 01:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
express verbal policy or a full
 
01:12:21.510 --> 01:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
confession by the business it's very
 
01:12:23.830 --> 01:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
difficult if not enforceable
 
01:12:26.070 --> 01:12:26.080 align:start position:0%
impossible for us to investigate and
 
01:12:28.390 --> 01:12:28.400 align:start position:0%
enforce and prove which of the two it
 
01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:29.510 align:start position:0%
enforce and prove which of the two it
was

01:12:29.510 --> 01:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:12:31.110 --> 01:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
i think that's very well stated thank
 
01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:31.990 align:start position:0%
i think that's very well stated thank
you

01:12:31.990 --> 01:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:12:34.390 --> 01:12:34.400 align:start position:0%
okay representative burroughs
 
01:12:37.270 --> 01:12:37.280 align:start position:0%
clarification on this let's say that a a
 
01:12:39.270 --> 01:12:39.280 align:start position:0%
business um their court their corporate
 
01:12:41.430 --> 01:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
they have a corporate philosophy they
 
01:12:43.830 --> 01:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
use an order or a mission statement to
 
01:12:46.470 --> 01:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
attract customers um our mission is to
 
01:12:49.669 --> 01:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
only invest in in clean energy
 
01:12:52.470 --> 01:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
could they go after them for that
 
01:12:54.390 --> 01:12:54.400 align:start position:0%
if they you know discriminated against a
 
01:12:56.070 --> 01:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel company when that is the
 
01:12:58.790 --> 01:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
mission of the bank and and it stated
 
01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:01.510 align:start position:0%
mission of the bank and and it stated
clearly

01:13:01.510 --> 01:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:04.310 --> 01:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
again he doesn't cover banks
 
01:13:06.630 --> 01:13:06.640 align:start position:0%
he does not do banks okay
 
01:13:09.030 --> 01:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
the bank either banking the banking is
 
01:13:11.669 --> 01:13:11.679 align:start position:0%
in particularly excluded
 
01:13:12.950 --> 01:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
from the consumer price okay then
 
01:13:14.790 --> 01:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
another another type so what i would say
 
01:13:18.070 --> 01:13:18.080 align:start position:0%
is if i if i were in the oil business
 
01:13:20.229 --> 01:13:20.239 align:start position:0%
and the bank has goes out and says we
 
01:13:20.239 --> 01:13:21.430 align:start position:0%
and the bank has goes out and says we
don't

01:13:21.430 --> 01:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:13:23.030 --> 01:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
do business
 
01:13:24.870 --> 01:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
with oil companies
 
01:13:27.669 --> 01:13:27.679 align:start position:0%
and because that that we this is our our
 
01:13:29.990 --> 01:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
approach to consumers
 
01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
i would be wondering why would they be
 
01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
pursuing that law you know loan from
 
01:13:36.149 --> 01:13:36.159 align:start position:0%
that institution knowing full well that
 
01:13:37.830 --> 01:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
institution has publicly said that they
 
01:13:40.630 --> 01:13:40.640 align:start position:0%
don't do it but notwithstanding that
 
01:13:43.990 --> 01:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
that that yes a in the financial
 
01:13:46.229 --> 01:13:46.239 align:start position:0%
institution is going to say their that
 
01:13:48.149 --> 01:13:48.159 align:start position:0%
bank is doing that for their marketing
 
01:13:48.159 --> 01:13:49.110 align:start position:0%
bank is doing that for their marketing
approach

01:13:49.110 --> 01:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
approach
 
01:13:51.189 --> 01:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
and therefore they can document why they
 
01:13:52.870 --> 01:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
think that that's what the consumers
 
01:13:54.470 --> 01:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
want and that's what they're doing and
 
01:13:56.950 --> 01:13:56.960 align:start position:0%
that would be a rationale okay thanks
 
01:13:58.630 --> 01:13:58.640 align:start position:0%
representative mike later thank you mr
 
01:14:00.790 --> 01:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
chairman um
 
01:14:02.790 --> 01:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
question this would have to do with
 
01:14:05.270 --> 01:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
employment as well would it not
 
01:14:07.669 --> 01:14:07.679 align:start position:0%
employment um
 
01:14:09.110 --> 01:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
employment practices are business
 
01:14:10.950 --> 01:14:10.960 align:start position:0%
practices right yes i believe it would
 
01:14:13.590 --> 01:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
but it seems to me that it's it is
 
01:14:15.229 --> 01:14:15.239 align:start position:0%
taking every bit of
 
01:14:18.550 --> 01:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
subjectivity out of any choice
 
01:14:20.550 --> 01:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
in other words it's really telling a
 
01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
business what they can or cannot do
 
01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:26.080 align:start position:0%
in other words if if i'm interviewing a
 
01:14:28.950 --> 01:14:28.960 align:start position:0%
a prospect that i might want to hire uh
 
01:14:31.270 --> 01:14:31.280 align:start position:0%
i just might not like the guy
 
01:14:33.270 --> 01:14:33.280 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:14:35.189 --> 01:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
well you can't that you can't use that
 
01:14:37.750 --> 01:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
as an excuse
 
01:14:38.870 --> 01:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
i don't like that
 
01:14:42.310 --> 01:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
i don't like the cut of his gym okay um
 
01:14:44.310 --> 01:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
and and he may have put
 
01:14:46.229 --> 01:14:46.239 align:start position:0%
and i also think this is the possibility
 
01:14:48.070 --> 01:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
that people might put something on their
 
01:14:50.790 --> 01:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
social media that would sort of give
 
01:14:53.750 --> 01:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
them an excuse to uh
 
01:14:56.310 --> 01:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
to bring out a complaint i see that
 
01:14:58.149 --> 01:14:58.159 align:start position:0%
happening as well i just find this
 
01:15:00.790 --> 01:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
extremely vague i find it sort of
 
01:15:03.030 --> 01:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
dictating to a business
 
01:15:04.870 --> 01:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
how they should operate and i'm taking
 
01:15:08.149 --> 01:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
all the subject subjectivity out of a
 
01:15:11.189 --> 01:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
decision when i just don't like this guy
 
01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
i don't like the cut of his jib
 
01:15:15.830 --> 01:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
would you believe would you believe okay
 
01:15:18.390 --> 01:15:18.400 align:start position:0%
so very much you know i think that the
 
01:15:20.229 --> 01:15:20.239 align:start position:0%
the issue that you're seeing is more of
 
01:15:22.630 --> 01:15:22.640 align:start position:0%
a policy issue uh which is a question
 
01:15:24.149 --> 01:15:24.159 align:start position:0%
for you know the commission and the
 
01:15:25.430 --> 01:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
legislature not for the attorney
 
01:15:27.350 --> 01:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
general's office i'm just here to talk
 
01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
about the enforceability if it was
 
01:15:30.709 --> 01:15:30.719 align:start position:0%
passed in its current form so do you
 
01:15:34.229 --> 01:15:34.239 align:start position:0%
have a question that's not bank related
 
01:15:34.239 --> 01:15:35.030 align:start position:0%
have a question that's not bank related
yes

01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:36.390 align:start position:0%
yes
okay

01:15:36.390 --> 01:15:36.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:15:38.390 --> 01:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
first of all
 
01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
this is not just
 
01:15:42.470 --> 01:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
we've been looking at it as business to
 
01:15:44.070 --> 01:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
business transactions and we need to
 
01:15:46.790 --> 01:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
break it down to the individual person
 
01:15:48.790 --> 01:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
because there's coming a time when
 
01:15:50.790 --> 01:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
somebody's going to be going to work one
 
01:15:52.470 --> 01:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
day and they're going to stop to put gas
 
01:15:55.510 --> 01:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
in their car and their their their their
 
01:15:57.189 --> 01:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
card their debit card is going to get
 
01:15:59.350 --> 01:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
declined not because they don't have
 
01:16:02.709 --> 01:16:02.719 align:start position:0%
money in the bank but because they drive
 
01:16:04.470 --> 01:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
that's a banking quit that's a banking
 
01:16:06.470 --> 01:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
question no no hold on hold on debit
 
01:16:08.070 --> 01:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
card is a banking question i understand
 
01:16:09.830 --> 01:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
it but it's all because they drive a
 
01:16:11.590 --> 01:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
fossil fueled car and they have to drive
 
01:16:13.510 --> 01:16:13.520 align:start position:0%
to work and if somebody is determined
 
01:16:16.470 --> 01:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
that they drive too far to get to work
 
01:16:19.350 --> 01:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
and their job is not important
 
01:16:21.030 --> 01:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
okay that that's a would you believe
 
01:16:22.070 --> 01:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
question that's a would you believe
 
01:16:24.550 --> 01:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
question but it goes beyond that
 
01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:25.830 align:start position:0%
question but it goes beyond that
to

01:16:25.830 --> 01:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:16:28.390 --> 01:16:28.400 align:start position:0%
you know it's this is how how we we had
 
01:16:30.550 --> 01:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
the the attorney excuse me the
 
01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:32.229 align:start position:0%
the the attorney excuse me the
um

01:16:32.229 --> 01:16:32.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:33.990 --> 01:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
oh my goodness um what's his position
 
01:16:35.830 --> 01:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
dude we're really tight on time the
 
01:16:38.070 --> 01:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
surgeon general of the united states
 
01:16:40.790 --> 01:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
came out this is an official now
 
01:16:42.310 --> 01:16:42.320 align:start position:0%
from the from the biden administration
 
01:16:45.750 --> 01:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
itself calling for private business
 
01:16:47.350 --> 01:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
to censor
 
01:16:49.590 --> 01:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
a private citizen
 
01:16:51.669 --> 01:16:51.679 align:start position:0%
this the surgeon general called for
 
01:16:55.510 --> 01:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
spotify to censor joe rogan
 
01:16:55.520 --> 01:16:57.189 align:start position:0%
spotify to censor joe rogan
okay

01:16:57.189 --> 01:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:17:00.070 --> 01:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
up until joe rogan made a comment
 
01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:00.950 align:start position:0%
up until joe rogan made a comment
that

01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
the surgeon general didn't like
 
01:17:06.390 --> 01:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
joe rogan was fine
 
01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:07.270 align:start position:0%
joe rogan was fine
okay

01:17:07.270 --> 01:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:17:10.470 --> 01:17:10.480 align:start position:0%
but the point is we now have an official
 
01:17:12.470 --> 01:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:13.669 align:start position:0%
federal government
policy

01:17:13.669 --> 01:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
policy
 
01:17:15.110 --> 01:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
calling for
 
01:17:17.110 --> 01:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
the censorship
 
01:17:19.990 --> 01:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
through the use of a business
 
01:17:21.750 --> 01:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
so now the government is now telling the
 
01:17:23.990 --> 01:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
business we want you to censor this guy
 
01:17:25.910 --> 01:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter why
 
01:17:27.510 --> 01:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
the federal government is now telling a
 
01:17:29.590 --> 01:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
private business to censor now at this
 
01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:30.550 align:start position:0%
private business to censor now at this
point

01:17:30.550 --> 01:17:30.560 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:17:32.550 --> 01:17:32.560 align:start position:0%
spotify has said
 
01:17:34.070 --> 01:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to tell neil young to go
 
01:17:35.189 --> 01:17:35.199 align:start position:0%
pound sand and we're going to keep joe
 
01:17:36.550 --> 01:17:36.560 align:start position:0%
rogan because he generates more money
 
01:17:37.990 --> 01:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
for us
 
01:17:40.950 --> 01:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
okay so so this is this is this is the
 
01:17:42.709 --> 01:17:42.719 align:start position:0%
kind of thing that is happening joe
 
01:17:44.950 --> 01:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
rogan is not a conservative okay
 
01:17:47.110 --> 01:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
so it's not about one specific political
 
01:17:49.750 --> 01:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
ideology it's about government telling
 
01:17:51.669 --> 01:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
businesses to censor because they can't
 
01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
do it because the first amendment but if
 
01:17:55.830 --> 01:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
i can coerce a private business to
 
01:17:57.750 --> 01:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
censor somebody then that's how they're
 
01:17:58.870 --> 01:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
going to do it they're going to turn the
 
01:18:01.350 --> 01:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
screws on the private businesses to
 
01:18:03.270 --> 01:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
screw over the people okay so that's
 
01:18:04.310 --> 01:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
where the discrimination is going to
 
01:18:06.229 --> 01:18:06.239 align:start position:0%
come it's not it and i'm telling you you
 
01:18:07.669 --> 01:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
don't want my guy in charge either
 
01:18:09.430 --> 01:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
telling telling business to turn you
 
01:18:11.830 --> 01:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
down either so it's not one-sided it's
 
01:18:13.510 --> 01:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
both ways
 
01:18:15.430 --> 01:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
okay so that's a would you believe
 
01:18:17.110 --> 01:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
question no you better believe it
 
01:18:20.229 --> 01:18:20.239 align:start position:0%
because it just happened okay so
 
01:18:22.709 --> 01:18:22.719 align:start position:0%
okay all right do we
 
01:18:22.719 --> 01:18:23.830 align:start position:0%
okay all right do we
um

01:18:23.830 --> 01:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:27.189 --> 01:18:27.199 align:start position:0%
thank you real specific question now
 
01:18:29.910 --> 01:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
well um my question is does that sound
 
01:18:32.310 --> 01:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
like a political motive to you his
 
01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:33.270 align:start position:0%
like a political motive to you his
question

01:18:33.270 --> 01:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:18:35.189 --> 01:18:35.199 align:start position:0%
does that sound like a political motive
 
01:18:37.910 --> 01:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
or not so i don't think that that is a
 
01:18:39.189 --> 01:18:39.199 align:start position:0%
question that's appropriate for me to
 
01:18:40.630 --> 01:18:40.640 align:start position:0%

01:25:46.550 --> 01:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:50.310 --> 01:25:50.320 align:start position:0%

the committee mr chair
 
01:26:06.470 --> 01:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
my bill is quite simple just a few lines
 
01:26:08.149 --> 01:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
this is about health insurance this is
 
01:26:12.870 --> 01:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:14.470 --> 01:26:14.480 align:start position:0%
with friends help i found out that the
 
01:26:16.470 --> 01:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
short-term health insurance in new
 
01:26:18.709 --> 01:26:18.719 align:start position:0%
hampshire is restricted unlike
 
01:26:21.750 --> 01:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
in some other states and the short-term
 
01:26:23.110 --> 01:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
insurance though may not be
 
01:26:25.590 --> 01:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
comprehensive this is perfect uh
 
01:26:27.990 --> 01:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
vehicle for people with low-income
 
01:26:29.669 --> 01:26:29.679 align:start position:0%
people people who are working gig
 
01:26:31.110 --> 01:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
economy people
 
01:26:32.950 --> 01:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
who are between jobs in these uncertain
 
01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:33.990 align:start position:0%
who are between jobs in these uncertain
times

01:26:33.990 --> 01:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
times
 
01:26:35.910 --> 01:26:35.920 align:start position:0%
who can't afford the multi thousand
 
01:26:38.390 --> 01:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
dollar premiums per month
 
01:26:41.510 --> 01:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
and who would enjoy this kind of care or
 
01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:43.430 align:start position:0%
and who would enjoy this kind of care or
coverage

01:26:43.430 --> 01:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
coverage
 
01:26:44.629 --> 01:26:44.639 align:start position:0%
while they're looking for something else
 
01:26:48.950 --> 01:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:50.229 --> 01:26:50.239 align:start position:0%
that's what my build is about it's
 
01:26:52.229 --> 01:26:52.239 align:start position:0%
opening up that market to the people who
 
01:26:54.629 --> 01:26:54.639 align:start position:0%
don't have any insurance right now
 
01:26:56.790 --> 01:26:56.800 align:start position:0%
we have the fiscal note on the bill
 
01:26:59.030 --> 01:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
it's all zeros throughout every year
 
01:27:00.790 --> 01:27:00.800 align:start position:0%
there's no appropriations there are no
 
01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:02.830 align:start position:0%
there's no appropriations there are no
expenditures

01:27:02.830 --> 01:27:02.840 align:start position:0%
expenditures
 
01:27:05.830 --> 01:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
revenue is undetermined
 
01:27:08.149 --> 01:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
now the fiscal note states that opening
 
01:27:10.149 --> 01:27:10.159 align:start position:0%
up lower cost
 
01:27:12.870 --> 01:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
options to consumers will
 
01:27:15.510 --> 01:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
um affect the
 
01:27:19.110 --> 01:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
established companies so by having these
 
01:27:20.950 --> 01:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
options given to consumers they make it
 
01:27:22.950 --> 01:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
sound like that's a bad thing to people
 
01:27:25.030 --> 01:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
who do not have insurance currently but
 
01:27:26.070 --> 01:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
i don't believe the established
 
01:27:27.430 --> 01:27:27.440 align:start position:0%
companies will suffer because some of
 
01:27:29.430 --> 01:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
them already provide these term plans in
 
01:27:31.189 --> 01:27:31.199 align:start position:0%
other states where they can
 
01:27:32.790 --> 01:27:32.800 align:start position:0%
and in new hampshire we're looking at
 
01:27:34.470 --> 01:27:34.480 align:start position:0%
five percent of all granite staters are
 
01:27:36.149 --> 01:27:36.159 align:start position:0%
uninsured currently
 
01:27:37.669 --> 01:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
just because they cannot afford anything
 
01:27:37.679 --> 01:27:38.790 align:start position:0%
just because they cannot afford anything
better

01:27:38.790 --> 01:27:38.800 align:start position:0%
better
 
01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:39.510 align:start position:0%
better
so

01:27:39.510 --> 01:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:27:41.270 --> 01:27:41.280 align:start position:0%
by removing the restrictions that exist
 
01:27:43.030 --> 01:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
in statute today will provide for better
 
01:27:47.189 --> 01:27:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:49.510 --> 01:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
for example in other states i like in
 
01:27:51.189 --> 01:27:51.199 align:start position:0%
florida i look in florida they do not
 
01:27:53.910 --> 01:27:53.920 align:start position:0%
have restrictions such as we do
 
01:27:55.910 --> 01:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
there are seven providers that provide
 
01:27:57.990 --> 01:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
term plans in florida in new hampshire
 
01:28:00.790 --> 01:28:00.800 align:start position:0%
there's only one and they only do six
 
01:28:03.270 --> 01:28:03.280 align:start position:0%
effectively five months plan
 
01:28:06.470 --> 01:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
once in florida consumers are
 
01:28:09.270 --> 01:28:09.280 align:start position:0%
able to purchase a year at a time and
 
01:28:11.669 --> 01:28:11.679 align:start position:0%
renew three times
 
01:28:13.189 --> 01:28:13.199 align:start position:0%
now there are there's oversight at the
 
01:28:14.790 --> 01:28:14.800 align:start position:0%
federal level that affects everybody
 
01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:15.830 align:start position:0%
federal level that affects everybody
else

01:28:15.830 --> 01:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
else
 
01:28:17.830 --> 01:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
but it's working in other states and
 
01:28:19.350 --> 01:28:19.360 align:start position:0%
providers are moving in so i'd like to
 
01:28:23.110 --> 01:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:24.070 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:28:24.070 --> 01:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:28:25.669 --> 01:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
i think this is perfect time to look at
 
01:28:28.310 --> 01:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
these options because with the current
 
01:28:29.990 --> 01:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
shortages and scheduling issues and
 
01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:31.590 align:start position:0%
shortages and scheduling issues and
precautions

01:28:31.590 --> 01:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
precautions
 
01:28:32.870 --> 01:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
the few months that the new hampshire
 
01:28:34.550 --> 01:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
consumers get in these term plans is
 
01:28:35.910 --> 01:28:35.920 align:start position:0%
really not enough if there's something
 
01:28:37.189 --> 01:28:37.199 align:start position:0%
serious they need to go back for a
 
01:28:39.590 --> 01:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
consultation they need to do
 
01:28:41.990 --> 01:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
some extra
 
01:28:44.229 --> 01:28:44.239 align:start position:0%
interfacing with providers so the few
 
01:28:45.990 --> 01:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
months that they get is really nothing
 
01:28:47.750 --> 01:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
quite useless i would say again we're
 
01:28:49.590 --> 01:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
looking at five percent of
 
01:28:52.070 --> 01:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
citizens uninsured at this point
 
01:28:53.669 --> 01:28:53.679 align:start position:0%
so i'd like to give them
 
01:28:55.510 --> 01:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
these options because this is new age
 
01:28:57.590 --> 01:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
this is after the chaos of the last few
 
01:29:00.709 --> 01:29:00.719 align:start position:0%
years in the medical health fields
 
01:29:03.270 --> 01:29:03.280 align:start position:0%
i think they need this and i understand
 
01:29:05.430 --> 01:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
there are bureaucracies that are
 
01:29:07.430 --> 01:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes lazy to look at new options
 
01:29:08.950 --> 01:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
but not all of them the smart ones
 
01:29:10.950 --> 01:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
already offering these plans and the
 
01:29:13.910 --> 01:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
smart ones will get the consumers
 
01:29:16.229 --> 01:29:16.239 align:start position:0%
the from the news pool of people which
 
01:29:18.870 --> 01:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
is probably close to 100 000 in new
 
01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:21.270 align:start position:0%
is probably close to 100 000 in new
hampshire

01:29:21.270 --> 01:29:21.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:29:21.280 --> 01:29:22.070 align:start position:0%
hampshire
so

01:29:22.070 --> 01:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:24.310 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:29:24.310 --> 01:29:24.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:26.629 --> 01:29:26.639 align:start position:0%
so the these people usually younger
 
01:29:28.550 --> 01:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
people people in between jobs people of
 
01:29:31.030 --> 01:29:31.040 align:start position:0%
lower means lower income they don't
 
01:29:32.709 --> 01:29:32.719 align:start position:0%
require the belts and whistles plans
 
01:29:32.719 --> 01:29:34.070 align:start position:0%
require the belts and whistles plans
that

01:29:34.070 --> 01:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:29:36.149 --> 01:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
many other companies provide they can go
 
01:29:38.550 --> 01:29:38.560 align:start position:0%
for something simple and these plans the
 
01:29:40.470 --> 01:29:40.480 align:start position:0%
term plans would cost less than 100 a
 
01:29:42.550 --> 01:29:42.560 align:start position:0%
month which is quite affordable to those
 
01:29:44.629 --> 01:29:44.639 align:start position:0%
who seek it so let's please give them
 
01:29:45.830 --> 01:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
the option
 
01:29:48.149 --> 01:29:48.159 align:start position:0%
let's give them the option to enroll to
 
01:29:49.590 --> 01:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
get insured with the coverage they can
 
01:29:50.870 --> 01:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
actually afford
 
01:29:53.189 --> 01:29:53.199 align:start position:0%
so thank you okay
 
01:29:53.199 --> 01:29:54.070 align:start position:0%
so thank you okay
uh

01:29:54.070 --> 01:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:29:56.149 --> 01:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
representative weston had a question yes
 
01:29:57.669 --> 01:29:57.679 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for coming today and thanks
 
01:29:59.750 --> 01:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my question you mentioned
 
01:30:01.590 --> 01:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
some federal oversight and i wonder if
 
01:30:03.910 --> 01:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
you could clarify what you mean by that
 
01:30:06.310 --> 01:30:06.320 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you for the question so
 
01:30:06.320 --> 01:30:07.350 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you for the question so
currently

01:30:07.350 --> 01:30:07.360 align:start position:0%
currently
 
01:30:09.590 --> 01:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
um the federal oversight is renewals
 
01:30:11.350 --> 01:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
there are three renewals of these plans
 
01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:12.950 align:start position:0%
there are three renewals of these plans
allowed

01:30:12.950 --> 01:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
allowed
 
01:30:14.709 --> 01:30:14.719 align:start position:0%
that's what they are thank you
 
01:30:18.229 --> 01:30:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:20.709 --> 01:30:20.719 align:start position:0%
i thought they the
 
01:30:22.950 --> 01:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
obamacare banned
 
01:30:24.950 --> 01:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
banned them because they were considered
 
01:30:27.910 --> 01:30:27.920 align:start position:0%
under insured that their policies were
 
01:30:30.229 --> 01:30:30.239 align:start position:0%
limited they had caps they had things
 
01:30:31.910 --> 01:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
and so theoretically
 
01:30:33.669 --> 01:30:33.679 align:start position:0%
they were illegal
 
01:30:37.189 --> 01:30:37.199 align:start position:0%
under after under the federal law
 
01:30:39.510 --> 01:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question not today
 
01:30:41.350 --> 01:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
three renewals are allowed
 
01:30:45.189 --> 01:30:45.199 align:start position:0%
and again these are 400 a month
 
01:30:46.550 --> 01:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
well the reason yeah the reason they're
 
01:30:48.149 --> 01:30:48.159 align:start position:0%
so cheap is some of them were only ten
 
01:30:50.070 --> 01:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
01:30:51.510 --> 01:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
over the year
 
01:30:52.709 --> 01:30:52.719 align:start position:0%
that the whole plan that was the only
 
01:30:54.470 --> 01:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
thing it would cover a payout maximum
 
01:30:56.149 --> 01:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
was ten thousand dollars so that was
 
01:30:59.910 --> 01:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:02.149 --> 01:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
so so that that that's why it was
 
01:31:02.159 --> 01:31:03.350 align:start position:0%
so so that that that's why it was
considered

01:31:03.350 --> 01:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
considered
 
01:31:04.790 --> 01:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
back then yes
 
01:31:06.470 --> 01:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
thank you there were some changes made
 
01:31:08.709 --> 01:31:08.719 align:start position:0%
so you know they are allowed and with
 
01:31:10.629 --> 01:31:10.639 align:start position:0%
three renewals at the federal level that
 
01:31:11.910 --> 01:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
would be interesting to find out okay
 
01:31:14.310 --> 01:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
thank you robertson griesen thank you mr
 
01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:15.189 align:start position:0%
thank you robertson griesen thank you mr
chair

01:31:15.189 --> 01:31:15.199 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:31:17.750 --> 01:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for uh representative for this
 
01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:18.870 align:start position:0%
thank you for uh representative for this
uh

01:31:18.870 --> 01:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:31:20.950 --> 01:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
do these plans
 
01:31:23.990 --> 01:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
also cover mental health or should they
 
01:31:26.550 --> 01:31:26.560 align:start position:0%
because it's not specified in
 
01:31:30.070 --> 01:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
the wording that you presently have
 
01:31:31.910 --> 01:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question
 
01:31:35.030 --> 01:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not quite sure if they do
 
01:31:36.709 --> 01:31:36.719 align:start position:0%
um it's up to the providers when they
 
01:31:38.950 --> 01:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
come in again like in say florida there
 
01:31:40.149 --> 01:31:40.159 align:start position:0%
are seven different providers so i'm
 
01:31:41.590 --> 01:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
sure there are some differences between
 
01:31:43.430 --> 01:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
them in new hampshire we only have one
 
01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:44.390 align:start position:0%
them in new hampshire we only have one
currently

01:31:44.390 --> 01:31:44.400 align:start position:0%
currently
 
01:31:46.229 --> 01:31:46.239 align:start position:0%
and as more more of them will move in
 
01:31:47.830 --> 01:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
i'm sure they'll provide
 
01:31:50.229 --> 01:31:50.239 align:start position:0%
what the public is seeking the most
 
01:31:52.310 --> 01:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
but yeah but mine is a restriction i
 
01:31:54.870 --> 01:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
don't go into specific coverage
 
01:31:56.870 --> 01:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
in the ability
 
01:31:57.910 --> 01:31:57.920 align:start position:0%
none thank you very much for your
 
01:32:00.950 --> 01:32:00.960 align:start position:0%

01:32:00.960 --> 01:32:02.310 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you okay

01:32:22.709 --> 01:32:22.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:26.870 --> 01:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:28.629 --> 01:32:28.639 align:start position:0%

01:32:31.270 --> 01:32:31.280 align:start position:0%
button and pull it up close to you
 
01:32:32.709 --> 01:32:32.719 align:start position:0%
uh good morning mr chair members of the
 
01:32:33.990 --> 01:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
committee my name is justin o'donnell
 
01:32:36.390 --> 01:32:36.400 align:start position:0%
from manchester um i have extensive
 
01:32:38.229 --> 01:32:38.239 align:start position:0%
experience in the insurance industry
 
01:32:40.070 --> 01:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
it's been my prime field of work for the
 
01:32:43.110 --> 01:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
past decade in all fields underwriting
 
01:32:46.149 --> 01:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
plan design plan construction sales and
 
01:32:48.950 --> 01:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
plan management um from everything from
 
01:32:51.270 --> 01:32:51.280 align:start position:0%
selling medicare plans to underwriting
 
01:32:53.110 --> 01:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
specific covert exemptions over the past
 
01:32:56.149 --> 01:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
two years and i helped representative
 
01:32:58.550 --> 01:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
yakubovich research this bill and when
 
01:33:00.390 --> 01:33:00.400 align:start position:0%
he approached me uh looking for
 
01:33:01.669 --> 01:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
something that we could do to expand the
 
01:33:03.990 --> 01:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
market one of my biggest concerns was
 
01:33:05.430 --> 01:33:05.440 align:start position:0%
seeing people that i've been selling
 
01:33:07.750 --> 01:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
insurance to for the past decade who are
 
01:33:09.030 --> 01:33:09.040 align:start position:0%
in that bubble
 
01:33:11.189 --> 01:33:11.199 align:start position:0%
where they make too much money to
 
01:33:13.830 --> 01:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
qualify for the subsidies to be able to
 
01:33:15.830 --> 01:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
afford the obamacare plans but not
 
01:33:17.189 --> 01:33:17.199 align:start position:0%
enough money
 
01:33:18.629 --> 01:33:18.639 align:start position:0%
to actually be able to afford them out
 
01:33:19.990 --> 01:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
of pocket while still paying their other
 
01:33:22.149 --> 01:33:22.159 align:start position:0%
bills and this is that little bubble of
 
01:33:23.270 --> 01:33:23.280 align:start position:0%
people that five percent of new
 
01:33:24.709 --> 01:33:24.719 align:start position:0%
hampshire that just do not have
 
01:33:27.510 --> 01:33:27.520 align:start position:0%
insurance because they have decided
 
01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:28.310 align:start position:0%
insurance because they have decided
that

01:33:28.310 --> 01:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:33:30.550 --> 01:33:30.560 align:start position:0%
the six hundred dollar a month premium
 
01:33:32.229 --> 01:33:32.239 align:start position:0%
with an eight thousand dollar a year
 
01:33:33.830 --> 01:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
deductible before they're actually
 
01:33:35.910 --> 01:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
covered for anything
 
01:33:37.669 --> 01:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
isn't worth the out-of-pocket expense
 
01:33:39.510 --> 01:33:39.520 align:start position:0%
for something they might may not need
 
01:33:40.790 --> 01:33:40.800 align:start position:0%
and it tends to be younger people it
 
01:33:42.790 --> 01:33:42.800 align:start position:0%
tends to be healthier people people who
 
01:33:44.629 --> 01:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
could pass a medical underwriting exam
 
01:33:47.590 --> 01:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
for a short-term plan people who
 
01:33:49.669 --> 01:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
would like catastrophic coverage in case
 
01:33:51.110 --> 01:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
something were to happen especially
 
01:33:52.550 --> 01:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
maybe a car accident because their
 
01:33:54.550 --> 01:33:54.560 align:start position:0%
primary source of income is uber or
 
01:33:56.709 --> 01:33:56.719 align:start position:0%
doordash and these gigan economies with
 
01:33:58.470 --> 01:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
employers that don't provide coverage
 
01:34:00.390 --> 01:34:00.400 align:start position:0%
for them removing these instruction
 
01:34:02.550 --> 01:34:02.560 align:start position:0%
restrictions on short-term plans would
 
01:34:04.629 --> 01:34:04.639 align:start position:0%
only benefit by
 
01:34:06.629 --> 01:34:06.639 align:start position:0%
allowing people greater access to a
 
01:34:08.229 --> 01:34:08.239 align:start position:0%
marketplace and to some of the questions
 
01:34:10.229 --> 01:34:10.239 align:start position:0%
that were asked some of the older plans
 
01:34:13.030 --> 01:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
with caps they just don't exist anymore
 
01:34:15.350 --> 01:34:15.360 align:start position:0%
those were true catastrophic plans so
 
01:34:17.270 --> 01:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
where they would just pay out the event
 
01:34:19.350 --> 01:34:19.360 align:start position:0%
that something were to happen
 
01:34:21.669 --> 01:34:21.679 align:start position:0%
similar to life insurance we call them
 
01:34:23.270 --> 01:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
they still exist and they're still
 
01:34:24.790 --> 01:34:24.800 align:start position:0%
actually very popular in new hampshire
 
01:34:26.390 --> 01:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
they were never regulated out we call
 
01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:27.110 align:start position:0%
they were never regulated out we call
them

01:34:27.110 --> 01:34:27.120 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:28.070 align:start position:0%
them
uh

01:34:28.070 --> 01:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:34:29.910 --> 01:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
named sickness or named illness plans
 
01:34:31.669 --> 01:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
the most popular cancer heart attack and
 
01:34:33.350 --> 01:34:33.360 align:start position:0%
stroke insurance where if you're
 
01:34:34.950 --> 01:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with cancer or if you have a
 
01:34:36.950 --> 01:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
heart attack or a stroke it pays out a
 
01:34:39.030 --> 01:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
ten thousand dollar lump sum
 
01:34:40.790 --> 01:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
the point of which is to cover the
 
01:34:42.870 --> 01:34:42.880 align:start position:0%
deductible on your obamacare plan that
 
01:34:45.669 --> 01:34:45.679 align:start position:0%
wouldn't pay for it otherwise
 
01:34:45.679 --> 01:34:46.550 align:start position:0%
wouldn't pay for it otherwise
so

01:34:46.550 --> 01:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:48.149 align:start position:0%
so
the

01:34:48.149 --> 01:34:48.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:34:49.990 --> 01:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
huge increase that we have seen in
 
01:34:51.910 --> 01:34:51.920 align:start position:0%
regulation over the past
 
01:34:53.910 --> 01:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
decade with health insurance has just
 
01:34:55.590 --> 01:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
left people
 
01:34:57.830 --> 01:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
in these odd positions where with your
 
01:34:59.430 --> 01:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
you're tethered to
 
01:35:02.070 --> 01:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
a w2 employment because you can't afford
 
01:35:04.390 --> 01:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
to be an entrepreneur because you can't
 
01:35:06.070 --> 01:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
afford to insure yourself and your
 
01:35:08.629 --> 01:35:08.639 align:start position:0%
family and a lot of young people like
 
01:35:11.189 --> 01:35:11.199 align:start position:0%
myself are in a position where we can't
 
01:35:13.109 --> 01:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
afford the health insurance that's on
 
01:35:15.430 --> 01:35:15.440 align:start position:0%
the marketplace
 
01:35:18.070 --> 01:35:18.080 align:start position:0%
unless we're tethered to a higher paying
 
01:35:21.030 --> 01:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
1099 job and are willing to pay the
 
01:35:23.030 --> 01:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a month for it whereas
 
01:35:24.790 --> 01:35:24.800 align:start position:0%
myself i would love to
 
01:35:27.030 --> 01:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
take a lower paying contract and focus
 
01:35:28.790 --> 01:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
on building my business and setting
 
01:35:31.030 --> 01:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
myself up for a future with my family
 
01:35:33.109 --> 01:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
but if i had to pay the insurance
 
01:35:35.109 --> 01:35:35.119 align:start position:0%
premiums that lower paying contract
 
01:35:38.470 --> 01:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:41.030 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:35:41.030 --> 01:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:42.149 --> 01:35:42.159 align:start position:0%
represent representative greeson has a
 
01:35:42.159 --> 01:35:43.990 align:start position:0%
represent representative greeson has a
question

01:35:43.990 --> 01:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:35:45.590 --> 01:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr and thank you for uh for
 
01:35:47.590 --> 01:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
your testimony uh
 
01:35:49.990 --> 01:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
would it be a correct assessment
 
01:35:51.990 --> 01:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
that this bill would open up the market
 
01:35:54.390 --> 01:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
to more choices for consumers and to
 
01:35:56.070 --> 01:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
actually be able to meet their needs
 
01:35:59.030 --> 01:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely as representative yakubovic
 
01:36:00.229 --> 01:36:00.239 align:start position:0%
said in florida there are seven
 
01:36:02.870 --> 01:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
providers in new hampshire there's one
 
01:36:04.149 --> 01:36:04.159 align:start position:0%
currently i'm a licensed health
 
01:36:06.310 --> 01:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
insurance sales agent in all 50 states i
 
01:36:08.070 --> 01:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
don't sell in new hampshire
 
01:36:10.070 --> 01:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
it's not worth it because there's no
 
01:36:14.070 --> 01:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:16.149 --> 01:36:16.159 align:start position:0%
so when you're the one policy that is
 
01:36:19.030 --> 01:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
here you don't consider it a viable
 
01:36:20.470 --> 01:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
product i don't consider it a viable
 
01:36:21.910 --> 01:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
product because
 
01:36:24.310 --> 01:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
it's it's very corner case it's a niche
 
01:36:26.390 --> 01:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
product it's you lose your job you get
 
01:36:28.550 --> 01:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
the short-term insurance and you have a
 
01:36:30.790 --> 01:36:30.800 align:start position:0%
new responsibility to hunt for a new job
 
01:36:31.750 --> 01:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
that's going to give you employer
 
01:36:33.350 --> 01:36:33.360 align:start position:0%
coverage because you're not allowed to
 
01:36:35.590 --> 01:36:35.600 align:start position:0%
renew that plan the one available in new
 
01:36:38.229 --> 01:36:38.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire what this bill does is list
 
01:36:39.910 --> 01:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
restrictions on the availability of
 
01:36:41.910 --> 01:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
renewals the insurance companies don't
 
01:36:43.109 --> 01:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
want to sell in new hampshire with
 
01:36:44.629 --> 01:36:44.639 align:start position:0%
short-term plans because they can't be
 
01:36:44.639 --> 01:36:45.669 align:start position:0%
short-term plans because they can't be
renewed

01:36:45.669 --> 01:36:45.679 align:start position:0%
renewed
 
01:36:47.189 --> 01:36:47.199 align:start position:0%
and if somebody has had short-term
 
01:36:48.629 --> 01:36:48.639 align:start position:0%
coverage in new hampshire right now
 
01:36:50.550 --> 01:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
anytime in the past three years they're
 
01:36:52.390 --> 01:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
ineligible to purchase a new short-term
 
01:36:54.629 --> 01:36:54.639 align:start position:0%
policy even if it's not a renewal
 
01:36:56.790 --> 01:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
so there's no incentive for insurance
 
01:36:58.390 --> 01:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
companies to even enter the market in
 
01:37:00.310 --> 01:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
new hampshire because they're restricted
 
01:37:02.550 --> 01:37:02.560 align:start position:0%
from offering consumers the ability to
 
01:37:04.629 --> 01:37:04.639 align:start position:0%
retain their products
 
01:37:06.950 --> 01:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
it's sort of an oxymoron if it's
 
01:37:09.510 --> 01:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
if it's short-term shouldn't it be
 
01:37:11.510 --> 01:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
non-renewal i mean isn't that the whole
 
01:37:14.070 --> 01:37:14.080 align:start position:0%
point non-renewal because if it's
 
01:37:15.830 --> 01:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
if you can keep renewing it then it
 
01:37:17.510 --> 01:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a short-term policy would it
 
01:37:19.270 --> 01:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
now so we look at short-term and on the
 
01:37:20.629 --> 01:37:20.639 align:start position:0%
sales side of insurance a little bit
 
01:37:22.070 --> 01:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
differently than people might look at it
 
01:37:24.629 --> 01:37:24.639 align:start position:0%
from a bureaucratic or legislative side
 
01:37:27.270 --> 01:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
where short term to us is the term of
 
01:37:29.270 --> 01:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
the policy before it resets
 
01:37:31.830 --> 01:37:31.840 align:start position:0%
and whether six months or one year as
 
01:37:34.149 --> 01:37:34.159 align:start position:0%
opposed to an indefinite period as long
 
01:37:35.669 --> 01:37:35.679 align:start position:0%
as you're employed
 
01:37:37.669 --> 01:37:37.679 align:start position:0%
the difference between the obamacare
 
01:37:39.910 --> 01:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
plans and the short-term plans
 
01:37:42.149 --> 01:37:42.159 align:start position:0%
is the medical underwriting and whether
 
01:37:43.510 --> 01:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
or not they cover pre-existing
 
01:37:44.950 --> 01:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
conditions there was a question about
 
01:37:47.030 --> 01:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
mental health again that does vary plan
 
01:37:48.709 --> 01:37:48.719 align:start position:0%
to plan not every plan will cover
 
01:37:50.709 --> 01:37:50.719 align:start position:0%
preventative mental health some will
 
01:37:52.390 --> 01:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
some won't and that will be reflected in
 
01:37:54.229 --> 01:37:54.239 align:start position:0%
their market price premiums and their
 
01:37:56.950 --> 01:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
deductibles that those plans have but
 
01:37:59.189 --> 01:37:59.199 align:start position:0%
usually short-term plans do have medical
 
01:38:01.550 --> 01:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
underwriting these would not be a
 
01:38:04.390 --> 01:38:04.400 align:start position:0%
one-size-fits-all approach to everybody
 
01:38:07.350 --> 01:38:07.360 align:start position:0%
this would not be a good plan for a lot
 
01:38:08.629 --> 01:38:08.639 align:start position:0%
of people
 
01:38:10.390 --> 01:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
but having the option out there for the
 
01:38:13.270 --> 01:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
people who it would be a good choice for
 
01:38:15.590 --> 01:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
is a good thing in my opinion
 
01:38:18.229 --> 01:38:18.239 align:start position:0%
would you just hit the magic word
 
01:38:18.239 --> 01:38:20.310 align:start position:0%
would you just hit the magic word
underwriting

01:38:20.310 --> 01:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
underwriting
 
01:38:23.750 --> 01:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
obamacare banned underwriting
 
01:38:25.189 --> 01:38:25.199 align:start position:0%
we actually
 
01:38:27.590 --> 01:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
banned underwriting in this state only
 
01:38:29.910 --> 01:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
for long-term credible coverage and the
 
01:38:31.990 --> 01:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
restrictions and definitions on what is
 
01:38:33.990 --> 01:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
credible coverage have been changed
 
01:38:35.990 --> 01:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
under the trump administration
 
01:38:37.750 --> 01:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
the penalties for not having credible
 
01:38:39.270 --> 01:38:39.280 align:start position:0%
coverage moved
 
01:38:41.590 --> 01:38:41.600 align:start position:0%
no i'm saying that
 
01:38:43.830 --> 01:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire actually
 
01:38:46.310 --> 01:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
banned medical underwriting
 
01:38:48.229 --> 01:38:48.239 align:start position:0%
for group health insurance this wouldn't
 
01:38:49.590 --> 01:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
be group health insurance this would be
 
01:38:50.790 --> 01:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
an individual
 
01:38:53.270 --> 01:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
we experimented with
 
01:38:53.280 --> 01:38:54.709 align:start position:0%
we experimented with
repealing

01:38:54.709 --> 01:38:54.719 align:start position:0%
repealing
 
01:38:57.350 --> 01:38:57.360 align:start position:0%
that ban for individuals
 
01:39:00.390 --> 01:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
for a brief period of time
 
01:39:04.629 --> 01:39:04.639 align:start position:0%
but then we unilaterally reversed that
 
01:39:07.109 --> 01:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
because the premiums
 
01:39:09.189 --> 01:39:09.199 align:start position:0%
to remove the medical underwriting was
 
01:39:12.870 --> 01:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:15.669 --> 01:39:15.679 align:start position:0%
so by removing medical underwriting
 
01:39:15.679 --> 01:39:16.470 align:start position:0%
so by removing medical underwriting
right

01:39:16.470 --> 01:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:39:18.229 --> 01:39:18.239 align:start position:0%
you would put the premiums to the roof
 
01:39:20.070 --> 01:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
because you would be de facto creating
 
01:39:22.550 --> 01:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
only a single large group where the
 
01:39:23.910 --> 01:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
insurance company would have to share
 
01:39:25.750 --> 01:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
every ensure every individual as part of
 
01:39:27.270 --> 01:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
a group and assume
 
01:39:29.109 --> 01:39:29.119 align:start position:0%
the worst case statistics guaranteed
 
01:39:30.470 --> 01:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
issue no
 
01:39:32.070 --> 01:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
assuming there's not guaranteed issue
 
01:39:33.270 --> 01:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
assuming that
 
01:39:34.709 --> 01:39:34.719 align:start position:0%
medical under in other words the whole
 
01:39:37.030 --> 01:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
reason why new hampshire plan is
 
01:39:38.790 --> 01:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
medically underwritten the premiums go
 
01:39:40.709 --> 01:39:40.719 align:start position:0%
down because the insurance company is
 
01:39:42.709 --> 01:39:42.719 align:start position:0%
allowed to assess the risk
 
01:39:45.430 --> 01:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
exactly so his plans these short-term
 
01:39:47.830 --> 01:39:47.840 align:start position:0%
plans would not be a would not be a good
 
01:39:49.830 --> 01:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
fit as i'm saying for somebody who has
 
01:39:51.750 --> 01:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
medical issues the target of these
 
01:39:53.990 --> 01:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
short-term plans is younger healthier
 
01:39:56.390 --> 01:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
people who might work in a gig economy
 
01:39:58.390 --> 01:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
who don't have a need for comprehensive
 
01:40:00.470 --> 01:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
coverage but want coverage that's
 
01:40:02.790 --> 01:40:02.800 align:start position:0%
cheaper and more affordable for them in
 
01:40:04.950 --> 01:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
the event something does happen these
 
01:40:07.750 --> 01:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
plans are ideal for covering a sickness
 
01:40:09.270 --> 01:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
that comes up or an accident that
 
01:40:11.590 --> 01:40:11.600 align:start position:0%
happens and in fact the word health
 
01:40:13.750 --> 01:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
insurance doesn't actually appear in
 
01:40:15.910 --> 01:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
most state laws we call it accident and
 
01:40:17.910 --> 01:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
sickness insurance correct
 
01:40:17.920 --> 01:40:19.270 align:start position:0%
sickness insurance correct
okay

01:40:19.270 --> 01:40:19.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:40:20.709 --> 01:40:20.719 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much for your
 
01:40:20.719 --> 01:40:22.709 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much for your
testimony

01:40:22.709 --> 01:40:22.719 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:40:25.750 --> 01:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
the chair will call greg moore from
 
01:40:27.990 --> 01:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
americans for prosperity who is in
 
01:40:34.470 --> 01:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:35.830 --> 01:40:35.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman members of the
 
01:40:37.270 --> 01:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
committee always a pleasure to come
 
01:40:39.030 --> 01:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
before the house commerce committee
 
01:40:41.189 --> 01:40:41.199 align:start position:0%
always a pleasure to see you greg thank
 
01:40:42.709 --> 01:40:42.719 align:start position:0%
you uh
 
01:40:44.229 --> 01:40:44.239 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is greg moore i'm
 
01:40:45.590 --> 01:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
the state director for americans for
 
01:40:47.510 --> 01:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
prosperity here in new hampshire and we
 
01:40:49.510 --> 01:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
come to testify in support of house bill
 
01:40:49.520 --> 01:40:51.430 align:start position:0%
come to testify in support of house bill
1028

01:40:51.430 --> 01:40:51.440 align:start position:0%
1028
 
01:40:54.390 --> 01:40:54.400 align:start position:0%
fundamentally uh it's a different space
 
01:40:56.070 --> 01:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
for us we don't usually play in the the
 
01:40:58.070 --> 01:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
the carrier space or the insurance base
 
01:41:00.070 --> 01:41:00.080 align:start position:0%
our focus in terms of reducing health
 
01:41:01.750 --> 01:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
care costs and i know that everybody on
 
01:41:03.430 --> 01:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
this committee has a an interest in
 
01:41:05.109 --> 01:41:05.119 align:start position:0%
trying to reduce healthcare costs we're
 
01:41:07.750 --> 01:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
more focused on increasing increa
 
01:41:10.149 --> 01:41:10.159 align:start position:0%
increasing the supply of providers and
 
01:41:11.430 --> 01:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
creating more competition in the
 
01:41:13.189 --> 01:41:13.199 align:start position:0%
provider space more than an insurance
 
01:41:14.790 --> 01:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
base but
 
01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:16.070 align:start position:0%
base but
um

01:41:16.070 --> 01:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:19.350 --> 01:41:19.360 align:start position:0%
the the sponsor uh
 
01:41:20.709 --> 01:41:20.719 align:start position:0%
reached out
 
01:41:22.790 --> 01:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
maybe even badgered uh
 
01:41:22.800 --> 01:41:23.750 align:start position:0%
maybe even badgered uh
us

01:41:23.750 --> 01:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:41:25.910 --> 01:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
to take a look at this particular piece
 
01:41:27.990 --> 01:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
of legislation so he did and i went back
 
01:41:30.229 --> 01:41:30.239 align:start position:0%
and i looked at the the history
 
01:41:31.590 --> 01:41:31.600 align:start position:0%
the initial
 
01:41:33.229 --> 01:41:33.239 align:start position:0%
genesis of
 
01:41:37.510 --> 01:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
rsa4155 roman 3 actually dates back to
 
01:41:39.189 --> 01:41:39.199 align:start position:0%
senate bill 30
 
01:41:41.830 --> 01:41:41.840 align:start position:0%
which is from 1995.
 
01:41:41.840 --> 01:41:42.870 align:start position:0%
which is from 1995.
um

01:41:42.870 --> 01:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:45.750 --> 01:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
it's a very thick piece of legislation
 
01:41:47.189 --> 01:41:47.199 align:start position:0%
that looks like it
 
01:41:49.590 --> 01:41:49.600 align:start position:0%
apparently came out of a out of a
 
01:41:52.550 --> 01:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
study committee but uh senate bill 30 is
 
01:41:54.149 --> 01:41:54.159 align:start position:0%
where the genesis of this this
 
01:41:57.350 --> 01:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
particular provision came into law now
 
01:41:57.360 --> 01:41:58.070 align:start position:0%
particular provision came into law now
the

01:41:58.070 --> 01:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:42:00.229 --> 01:42:00.239 align:start position:0%
the archives don't go back that far
 
01:42:06.149 --> 01:42:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:07.750 --> 01:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
about the same time that congress was
 
01:42:09.910 --> 01:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
discussing uh what ultimately ended up
 
01:42:12.629 --> 01:42:12.639 align:start position:0%
becoming hipaa and for those of for
 
01:42:13.590 --> 01:42:13.600 align:start position:0%
those folks
 
01:42:15.109 --> 01:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
hipaa doesn't just include medical
 
01:42:17.510 --> 01:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
privacy a lot of hipaa is about
 
01:42:19.669 --> 01:42:19.679 align:start position:0%
insurance regulation so it seems like
 
01:42:20.870 --> 01:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of concurrent issues
 
01:42:24.070 --> 01:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
with hipaa that are included in uh
 
01:42:26.470 --> 01:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
in in san diego 30.
 
01:42:28.550 --> 01:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
that initial iteration allowed for up to
 
01:42:30.550 --> 01:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
six months and no renewals so it was
 
01:42:33.350 --> 01:42:33.360 align:start position:0%
just six months and no renewals on that
 
01:42:35.109 --> 01:42:35.119 align:start position:0%
that was changed twice at the request of
 
01:42:37.590 --> 01:42:37.600 align:start position:0%
the department of insurance um
 
01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:38.709 align:start position:0%
the department of insurance um
in

01:42:38.709 --> 01:42:38.719 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:42:42.709 --> 01:42:42.719 align:start position:0%
2001 we have house bill 394 and that
 
01:42:45.830 --> 01:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
allowed for one renewal
 
01:42:48.149 --> 01:42:48.159 align:start position:0%
so two such policies
 
01:42:50.229 --> 01:42:50.239 align:start position:0%
within within a 12-month period but then
 
01:42:52.149 --> 01:42:52.159 align:start position:0%
you'd have to take a break before
 
01:42:54.310 --> 01:42:54.320 align:start position:0%
getting another one
 
01:42:58.390 --> 01:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
that changed in 2009 with house bill uh
 
01:43:02.310 --> 01:43:02.320 align:start position:0%
237 hospital 237 has the existing lane i
 
01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:04.790 align:start position:0%
237 hospital 237 has the existing lane i
was

01:43:04.790 --> 01:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:04.800 --> 01:43:05.750 align:start position:0%
 
for

01:43:05.750 --> 01:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:43:08.629 --> 01:43:08.639 align:start position:0%
540 days which essentially is 18 months
 
01:43:09.510 --> 01:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
out of
 
01:43:11.750 --> 01:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
out of any two-year period so
 
01:43:12.870 --> 01:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
the department of insurance has
 
01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:13.990 align:start position:0%
the department of insurance has
basically

01:43:13.990 --> 01:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
basically
 
01:43:16.229 --> 01:43:16.239 align:start position:0%
pushed out the the duration of these
 
01:43:17.669 --> 01:43:17.679 align:start position:0%
types of plans
 
01:43:17.679 --> 01:43:19.030 align:start position:0%
types of plans
and

01:43:19.030 --> 01:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:43:20.629 --> 01:43:20.639 align:start position:0%
ultimately there has been nothing since
 
01:43:23.109 --> 01:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
then largely because a lot of the
 
01:43:25.030 --> 01:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
individual market has been subsumed
 
01:43:27.590 --> 01:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
thanks to the affordable care act uh as
 
01:43:29.350 --> 01:43:29.360 align:start position:0%
a federal priority and to be fair the
 
01:43:31.189 --> 01:43:31.199 align:start position:0%
affordable care act is a great deal if
 
01:43:33.910 --> 01:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
you're between 138 and 200 percent of
 
01:43:35.830 --> 01:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
federal property level and it's a good
 
01:43:37.910 --> 01:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
deal if you're between 200 and 250
 
01:43:39.430 --> 01:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
percent of the federal property property
 
01:43:41.750 --> 01:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
level and then it sort of progressively
 
01:43:43.830 --> 01:43:43.840 align:start position:0%
becomes less and less a good deal until
 
01:43:46.390 --> 01:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
you hit 400 when the subsidies just drop
 
01:43:49.270 --> 01:43:49.280 align:start position:0%
off and you have to pay the full freight
 
01:43:51.270 --> 01:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
uh that's fine uh
 
01:43:53.590 --> 01:43:53.600 align:start position:0%
percent of the federal poverty level
 
01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:54.470 align:start position:0%
percent of the federal poverty level
is

01:43:54.470 --> 01:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:43:56.310 --> 01:43:56.320 align:start position:0%
for an individual is fifty four thousand
 
01:43:58.790 --> 01:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
three hundred and sixty dollars
 
01:44:00.229 --> 01:44:00.239 align:start position:0%
the catch is is that here in new
 
01:44:01.910 --> 01:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire the average
 
01:44:03.669 --> 01:44:03.679 align:start position:0%
weekly wage is thirteen hundred and
 
01:44:05.910 --> 01:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
forty five dollars which annualizes
 
01:44:07.350 --> 01:44:07.360 align:start position:0%
sixty nine thousand nine hundred and
 
01:44:09.590 --> 01:44:09.600 align:start position:0%
forty dollars or five hundred and
 
01:44:11.669 --> 01:44:11.679 align:start position:0%
fifteen percent of the federal property
 
01:44:13.750 --> 01:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
level which means that the average job
 
01:44:15.030 --> 01:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
01:44:16.870 --> 01:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
is putting you in a position where as an
 
01:44:19.109 --> 01:44:19.119 align:start position:0%
individual anyway obviously you have you
 
01:44:21.910 --> 01:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
can have a if you have a family your 400
 
01:44:24.470 --> 01:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
fpl goes up but as an individual you are
 
01:44:27.189 --> 01:44:27.199 align:start position:0%
now outside of getting any subsidies uh
 
01:44:29.510 --> 01:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
within the individual marketplace
 
01:44:30.790 --> 01:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
and i think there are a lot of people
 
01:44:33.109 --> 01:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
who are transitioning out of more
 
01:44:35.030 --> 01:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
traditional jobs into
 
01:44:37.270 --> 01:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
gig economy jobs who might be making the
 
01:44:39.510 --> 01:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
average wage for whom this this is a
 
01:44:41.350 --> 01:44:41.360 align:start position:0%
problem and so i spent a little time
 
01:44:43.430 --> 01:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
went on the
 
01:44:45.109 --> 01:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire marketplace which some
 
01:44:45.119 --> 01:44:46.870 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire marketplace which some
people

01:44:46.870 --> 01:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:44:48.629 --> 01:44:48.639 align:start position:0%
still colloquially referred to as the
 
01:44:50.870 --> 01:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
obamacare exchange but in the individual
 
01:44:52.950 --> 01:44:52.960 align:start position:0%
marketplace went in plugged in some
 
01:44:52.960 --> 01:44:53.990 align:start position:0%
marketplace went in plugged in some
numbers

01:44:53.990 --> 01:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
01:44:56.550 --> 01:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
put in i put in a 45 year old male
 
01:44:56.560 --> 01:44:57.830 align:start position:0%
put in i put in a 45 year old male
non-smoker

01:44:57.830 --> 01:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
non-smoker
 
01:44:59.750 --> 01:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
what did i get for a silver plan that's
 
01:45:02.629 --> 01:45:02.639 align:start position:0%
349 a month that's your that would be
 
01:45:04.790 --> 01:45:04.800 align:start position:0%
your your premium
 
01:45:06.390 --> 01:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
then they went over to ehealth to check
 
01:45:09.350 --> 01:45:09.360 align:start position:0%
the one provider of uh short-term health
 
01:45:10.629 --> 01:45:10.639 align:start position:0%
insurance in new hampshire and plugged
 
01:45:11.990 --> 01:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
in the same number
 
01:45:13.070 --> 01:45:13.080 align:start position:0%
came in at
 
01:45:15.990 --> 01:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
193 dollars a month which is 45 percent
 
01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:17.189 align:start position:0%
193 dollars a month which is 45 percent
less

01:45:17.189 --> 01:45:17.199 align:start position:0%
less
 
01:45:19.590 --> 01:45:19.600 align:start position:0%
obviously uh that's a savings of you
 
01:45:21.350 --> 01:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
know if you had it annualized it would
 
01:45:22.430 --> 01:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
be uh
 
01:45:24.629 --> 01:45:24.639 align:start position:0%
1876 dollars a month
 
01:45:26.149 --> 01:45:26.159 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:45:26.159 --> 01:45:27.189 align:start position:0%
and so
the

01:45:27.189 --> 01:45:27.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:45:29.430 --> 01:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
ability for folks particularly young
 
01:45:30.709 --> 01:45:30.719 align:start position:0%
people who
 
01:45:32.790 --> 01:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
no longer have access to
 
01:45:34.950 --> 01:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
no longer have access to employer
 
01:45:37.270 --> 01:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
insurance and frankly are looking at
 
01:45:39.750 --> 01:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
what's available as a silver plan in the
 
01:45:40.790 --> 01:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:45:43.830 --> 01:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
insurance the new hampshire marketplace
 
01:45:45.669 --> 01:45:45.679 align:start position:0%
these this might create an opportunity
 
01:45:48.709 --> 01:45:48.719 align:start position:0%
for them and so from our perspective as
 
01:45:50.390 --> 01:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
a deregulatory approach giving people
 
01:45:52.390 --> 01:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
another option and i'll grant you it's
 
01:45:54.550 --> 01:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
not the same policy it's not apples to
 
01:45:56.629 --> 01:45:56.639 align:start position:0%
apples we're not talking they're
 
01:45:58.550 --> 01:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
different types of plans
 
01:45:58.560 --> 01:45:59.669 align:start position:0%
different types of plans
and

01:45:59.669 --> 01:45:59.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:46:01.430 --> 01:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
i think but i think that the language
 
01:46:04.550 --> 01:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
here is is a positive deregulatory step
 
01:46:06.709 --> 01:46:06.719 align:start position:0%
um we think it's a good idea to move
 
01:46:08.470 --> 01:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
forward and it's it's a good idea to
 
01:46:10.709 --> 01:46:10.719 align:start position:0%
provide some option for some people
 
01:46:13.510 --> 01:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
it's but i'll i'll be the first person
 
01:46:15.189 --> 01:46:15.199 align:start position:0%
person to admit i've i went through the
 
01:46:17.669 --> 01:46:17.679 align:start position:0%
legislative history looking at the two
 
01:46:20.790 --> 01:46:20.800 align:start position:0%
the two pieces of 2001 and 2009. the
 
01:46:22.390 --> 01:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
good news is those archives are
 
01:46:24.070 --> 01:46:24.080 align:start position:0%
available those calendars are available
 
01:46:25.590 --> 01:46:25.600 align:start position:0%
so you can read the blurb you can read
 
01:46:26.709 --> 01:46:26.719 align:start position:0%
the minutes
 
01:46:26.719 --> 01:46:27.750 align:start position:0%
the minutes
and

01:46:27.750 --> 01:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:46:30.310 --> 01:46:30.320 align:start position:0%
and the historical complaint is that uh
 
01:46:31.510 --> 01:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
consumers don't know what they're
 
01:46:33.430 --> 01:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
getting and and
 
01:46:34.950 --> 01:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
that's been the complaint that they
 
01:46:36.629 --> 01:46:36.639 align:start position:0%
don't know what they're getting and i i
 
01:46:38.390 --> 01:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
think the legislation is a positive but
 
01:46:40.470 --> 01:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
i would i would say that we've certainly
 
01:46:42.070 --> 01:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
from the standpoint of uh from the
 
01:46:44.629 --> 01:46:44.639 align:start position:0%
standpoint of people purchasing and now
 
01:46:46.229 --> 01:46:46.239 align:start position:0%
when you're buying these types of plans
 
01:46:48.229 --> 01:46:48.239 align:start position:0%
a lot of them buy them via the internet
 
01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:50.080 align:start position:0%
which just adds one more level of
 
01:46:52.470 --> 01:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
obscurity i think that that putting
 
01:46:54.629 --> 01:46:54.639 align:start position:0%
something in there uh in addition to
 
01:46:55.990 --> 01:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
this about
 
01:46:57.590 --> 01:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
maybe giving the department of insurance
 
01:47:00.790 --> 01:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
uh some authority on it under 541a to
 
01:47:03.030 --> 01:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
require some disclosures uh
 
01:47:04.229 --> 01:47:04.239 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't be a bad idea
 
01:47:07.510 --> 01:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
generally but uh if and if you decide to
 
01:47:09.109 --> 01:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
move forward favorably on this type of
 
01:47:11.510 --> 01:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
plan it would be a definitely a positive
 
01:47:13.750 --> 01:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
step because um it used to be if you
 
01:47:15.510 --> 01:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to go buy a short-term policy you
 
01:47:17.270 --> 01:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
probably had to call a company directly
 
01:47:19.590 --> 01:47:19.600 align:start position:0%
or go through an agent who might explain
 
01:47:21.270 --> 01:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
some of the limitations of a plan like
 
01:47:23.910 --> 01:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
this right now there are none so that
 
01:47:25.270 --> 01:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
might be something that
 
01:47:27.109 --> 01:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
the committee wants to consider but we
 
01:47:28.390 --> 01:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
do support the bill and i'd be happy to
 
01:47:31.750 --> 01:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:35.109 --> 01:47:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:37.030 --> 01:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so this
 
01:47:39.189 --> 01:47:39.199 align:start position:0%
just so i make sure i understand it this
 
01:47:41.430 --> 01:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
would cover it as an example
 
01:47:43.830 --> 01:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
um a college student coming out of
 
01:47:45.590 --> 01:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
college they're coming off their parents
 
01:47:47.189 --> 01:47:47.199 align:start position:0%
plan at 26
 
01:47:49.270 --> 01:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
there 25 26 i can't remember exact
 
01:47:51.990 --> 01:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
cutoff but they haven't fully found a
 
01:47:53.350 --> 01:47:53.360 align:start position:0%
job that
 
01:47:55.350 --> 01:47:55.360 align:start position:0%
offers insurance yet this could cover
 
01:47:55.360 --> 01:47:56.470 align:start position:0%
offers insurance yet this could cover
them

01:47:56.470 --> 01:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:47:59.189 --> 01:47:59.199 align:start position:0%
in that short term
 
01:48:00.950 --> 01:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
i would say that depends on a case by
 
01:48:03.910 --> 01:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
case basis if you are somebody who is
 
01:48:06.629 --> 01:48:06.639 align:start position:0%
not making a lot of money i wouldn't go
 
01:48:08.310 --> 01:48:08.320 align:start position:0%
this route i think that going but if
 
01:48:10.070 --> 01:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
they had like a small job but they
 
01:48:12.709 --> 01:48:12.719 align:start position:0%
weren't in their career right if per se
 
01:48:14.149 --> 01:48:14.159 align:start position:0%
if they had a job where they were making
 
01:48:15.910 --> 01:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
the average new hampshire wage and
 
01:48:18.229 --> 01:48:18.239 align:start position:0%
they're outside of that 400 percent and
 
01:48:19.990 --> 01:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
maybe even you know once you get outside
 
01:48:22.310 --> 01:48:22.320 align:start position:0%
of like 300 percent it you know like i
 
01:48:24.070 --> 01:48:24.080 align:start position:0%
said progressively the the subsidies
 
01:48:26.229 --> 01:48:26.239 align:start position:0%
drop off pretty quickly this might be an
 
01:48:27.590 --> 01:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
option that would be a good choice for
 
01:48:30.149 --> 01:48:30.159 align:start position:0%
someone like that
 
01:48:34.790 --> 01:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
thank you okay thank you very much
 
01:48:36.950 --> 01:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh chair we'll call on michelle heaton
 
01:48:39.669 --> 01:48:39.679 align:start position:0%
from the insurance department because
 
01:48:42.629 --> 01:48:42.639 align:start position:0%
i guess tyler had to go somewhere else
 
01:48:45.510 --> 01:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
yeah i think he's in the senate
 
01:48:48.790 --> 01:48:48.800 align:start position:0%
what they're more important than us
 
01:48:50.870 --> 01:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
hello my name is michelle heaton i'm the
 
01:48:53.109 --> 01:48:53.119 align:start position:0%
health law and policy legal counsel at
 
01:48:55.109 --> 01:48:55.119 align:start position:0%
the insurance department you just pulled
 
01:48:56.790 --> 01:48:56.800 align:start position:0%
the mic a little bit closer
 
01:48:56.800 --> 01:48:58.950 align:start position:0%
the mic a little bit closer
thanks

01:48:58.950 --> 01:48:58.960 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
01:49:01.830 --> 01:49:01.840 align:start position:0%
is this better yeah
 
01:49:03.430 --> 01:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
so the insurance department does not
 
01:49:05.030 --> 01:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
have a formal position on this bill
 
01:49:06.709 --> 01:49:06.719 align:start position:0%
we're just here for really informational
 
01:49:06.719 --> 01:49:07.830 align:start position:0%
we're just here for really informational
purposes

01:49:07.830 --> 01:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
01:49:09.510 --> 01:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
and one of the concerns we do have with
 
01:49:12.149 --> 01:49:12.159 align:start position:0%
this bill is that
 
01:49:14.390 --> 01:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
the effect that's intended is not what's
 
01:49:16.470 --> 01:49:16.480 align:start position:0%
going to be accomplished by this bill
 
01:49:18.390 --> 01:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
and part of that reason is because the
 
01:49:21.109 --> 01:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
way short-term limited duration policies
 
01:49:23.430 --> 01:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
are defined at the federal level would
 
01:49:25.589 --> 01:49:25.599 align:start position:0%
preclude us from doing too much to
 
01:49:29.830 --> 01:49:29.840 align:start position:0%
deregulate it at a state level
 
01:49:32.070 --> 01:49:32.080 align:start position:0%
these are largely unregulated products
 
01:49:33.910 --> 01:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
but we do regulate them
 
01:49:35.990 --> 01:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire they are subject to
 
01:49:38.229 --> 01:49:38.239 align:start position:0%
insurance laws and there are specific
 
01:49:40.390 --> 01:49:40.400 align:start position:0%
insurance rules for short-term limited
 
01:49:42.950 --> 01:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
duration policies as well as ancillary
 
01:49:44.709 --> 01:49:44.719 align:start position:0%
health policies which are different than
 
01:49:46.709 --> 01:49:46.719 align:start position:0%
major medical and i know there was some
 
01:49:53.109 --> 01:49:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:56.149 --> 01:49:56.159 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
01:49:58.709 --> 01:49:58.719 align:start position:0%
consumers that usually
 
01:50:00.870 --> 01:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
buy these
 
01:50:03.350 --> 01:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
it is a stop gap measure and there are
 
01:50:04.790 --> 01:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
that's the reason why it is for a
 
01:50:06.790 --> 01:50:06.800 align:start position:0%
limited duration
 
01:50:09.109 --> 01:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
they do allow pre-existing conditions
 
01:50:11.350 --> 01:50:11.360 align:start position:0%
and they are not guaranteed renewable so
 
01:50:12.790 --> 01:50:12.800 align:start position:0%
they're not subject to the same
 
01:50:15.270 --> 01:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
requirements as typical major medical
 
01:50:15.280 --> 01:50:18.709 align:start position:0%
requirements as typical major medical
insurance

01:50:18.709 --> 01:50:18.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:20.149 --> 01:50:20.159 align:start position:0%
nationally there are reports that many
 
01:50:21.669 --> 01:50:21.679 align:start position:0%
consumers don't really understand what
 
01:50:23.270 --> 01:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
they're purchasing when they get these
 
01:50:25.589 --> 01:50:25.599 align:start position:0%
types of products and that they are
 
01:50:27.750 --> 01:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
misled into thinking that it covers more
 
01:50:30.149 --> 01:50:30.159 align:start position:0%
than what a traditional major med policy
 
01:50:33.030 --> 01:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:34.790 --> 01:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
there's also the concern that short-term
 
01:50:37.830 --> 01:50:37.840 align:start position:0%
policies may appeal to younger healthier
 
01:50:39.589 --> 01:50:39.599 align:start position:0%
people and those people are being pulled
 
01:50:41.750 --> 01:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
from the major medical insurance market
 
01:50:43.189 --> 01:50:43.199 align:start position:0%
which could cause
 
01:50:45.030 --> 01:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
an increase in premium for major med
 
01:50:45.040 --> 01:50:46.390 align:start position:0%
an increase in premium for major med

okay

okay
 
01:50:58.149 --> 01:50:58.159 align:start position:0%
all right uh any questions yes
 
01:50:59.910 --> 01:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
representative abel
 
01:51:02.390 --> 01:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
yes thank you thank you very much um and
 
01:51:04.870 --> 01:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for for testifying
 
01:51:07.030 --> 01:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
is it accurate to
 
01:51:09.750 --> 01:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
describe these kinds of policies as
 
01:51:12.629 --> 01:51:12.639 align:start position:0%
catastrophic coverage they are different
 
01:51:14.550 --> 01:51:14.560 align:start position:0%
than catastrophic coverage catastrophic
 
01:51:17.030 --> 01:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
coverage has different requirements and
 
01:51:18.870 --> 01:51:18.880 align:start position:0%
they are subject to certain aca
 
01:51:20.709 --> 01:51:20.719 align:start position:0%
requirements whereas short-term limited
 
01:51:22.790 --> 01:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
duration the way they're defined on the
 
01:51:25.109 --> 01:51:25.119 align:start position:0%
federal level specifically exempts them
 
01:51:29.830 --> 01:51:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:31.669 --> 01:51:31.679 align:start position:0%
representative greeson
 
01:51:33.030 --> 01:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
thank you ann thank you for your
 
01:51:34.790 --> 01:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
testimony the recommendation that came
 
01:51:36.310 --> 01:51:36.320 align:start position:0%
just a moment ago
 
01:51:39.189 --> 01:51:39.199 align:start position:0%
to uh require the insurance company to
 
01:51:42.709 --> 01:51:42.719 align:start position:0%
provide disclosures would would that be
 
01:51:44.149 --> 01:51:44.159 align:start position:0%
because you had said something about
 
01:51:44.159 --> 01:51:45.109 align:start position:0%
because you had said something about
people

01:51:45.109 --> 01:51:45.119 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:51:46.310 --> 01:51:46.320 align:start position:0%
not necessarily knowing what they're
 
01:51:46.320 --> 01:51:47.750 align:start position:0%
not necessarily knowing what they're
buying

01:51:47.750 --> 01:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
buying
 
01:51:49.350 --> 01:51:49.360 align:start position:0%
and therefore they could cause them some
 
01:51:52.390 --> 01:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
troubles would that be the solution uh
 
01:51:55.910 --> 01:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
these disclosures or or or how would
 
01:51:57.750 --> 01:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
what is it that was recommended versus
 
01:51:59.430 --> 01:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
how do we solve the problem of people
 
01:52:01.189 --> 01:52:01.199 align:start position:0%
not necessarily understanding
 
01:52:03.350 --> 01:52:03.360 align:start position:0%
what they're getting
 
01:52:05.109 --> 01:52:05.119 align:start position:0%
it's a harder problem to solve than you
 
01:52:06.070 --> 01:52:06.080 align:start position:0%
would think
 
01:52:06.080 --> 01:52:07.270 align:start position:0%
would think
under

01:52:07.270 --> 01:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
under
 
01:52:10.229 --> 01:52:10.239 align:start position:0%
we currently do have filing requirements
 
01:52:12.229 --> 01:52:12.239 align:start position:0%
and rules that regulate short-term
 
01:52:14.390 --> 01:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
limited duration policies as well as
 
01:52:15.910 --> 01:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
ancillary health policies and the
 
01:52:17.510 --> 01:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
ancillary health for those who may not
 
01:52:19.589 --> 01:52:19.599 align:start position:0%
be familiar would be like your hospital
 
01:52:19.599 --> 01:52:20.629 align:start position:0%
be familiar would be like your hospital
only

01:52:20.629 --> 01:52:20.639 align:start position:0%
only
 
01:52:22.870 --> 01:52:22.880 align:start position:0%
coverage for specific disease
 
01:52:24.950 --> 01:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
all of our rules do require a lot of
 
01:52:27.430 --> 01:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
these very specific disclosures and you
 
01:52:29.030 --> 01:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
know embold that this is not major
 
01:52:30.470 --> 01:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
medical coverage
 
01:52:32.709 --> 01:52:32.719 align:start position:0%
yet despite our efforts to try to put in
 
01:52:35.430 --> 01:52:35.440 align:start position:0%
these regulations and to
 
01:52:37.990 --> 01:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
help educate consumers on this it's a
 
01:52:39.990 --> 01:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
constant problem throughout the country
 
01:52:41.669 --> 01:52:41.679 align:start position:0%
that a lot of these ancillary health
 
01:52:43.430 --> 01:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
products are marketed in a way that
 
01:52:45.589 --> 01:52:45.599 align:start position:0%
misleads people into thinking they're
 
01:52:47.189 --> 01:52:47.199 align:start position:0%
buying major med coverage and it's
 
01:52:49.430 --> 01:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
something that not only our department
 
01:52:51.270 --> 01:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
but all insurance departments across the
 
01:52:53.189 --> 01:52:53.199 align:start position:0%
country are constantly trying to figure
 
01:52:55.750 --> 01:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
out ways to make it clearer
 
01:52:58.229 --> 01:52:58.239 align:start position:0%
for the question may inquire thank you
 
01:53:01.270 --> 01:53:01.280 align:start position:0%
so would you if we were to
 
01:53:03.990 --> 01:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
amend this bill to try to tackle that
 
01:53:05.669 --> 01:53:05.679 align:start position:0%
problem would you be able to assist us
 
01:53:07.270 --> 01:53:07.280 align:start position:0%
with language
 
01:53:10.310 --> 01:53:10.320 align:start position:0%
uh that
 
01:53:11.750 --> 01:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
i guess what i'm getting at is we want
 
01:53:13.270 --> 01:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
people to understand what they're buying
 
01:53:14.790 --> 01:53:14.800 align:start position:0%
but how many people buy all kinds of
 
01:53:16.310 --> 01:53:16.320 align:start position:0%
things not necessarily knowing exactly
 
01:53:17.830 --> 01:53:17.840 align:start position:0%
what they're buying like say automobile
 
01:53:19.430 --> 01:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
insurance for example
 
01:53:19.440 --> 01:53:20.310 align:start position:0%
insurance for example
uh

01:53:20.310 --> 01:53:20.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:53:21.669 --> 01:53:21.679 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:53:23.189 --> 01:53:23.199 align:start position:0%
is there is there a recommendation of
 
01:53:25.030 --> 01:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
language could you provide language that
 
01:53:26.709 --> 01:53:26.719 align:start position:0%
would work from an enforcement
 
01:53:28.870 --> 01:53:28.880 align:start position:0%
standpoint from the consumer protection
 
01:53:30.629 --> 01:53:30.639 align:start position:0%
standpoint and from the business that
 
01:53:32.950 --> 01:53:32.960 align:start position:0%
wants to sell the product standpoint
 
01:53:34.550 --> 01:53:34.560 align:start position:0%
yeah we would be happy this is something
 
01:53:36.310 --> 01:53:36.320 align:start position:0%
that we could do yeah and i believe we
 
01:53:37.910 --> 01:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
do have rules already on that so we
 
01:53:42.709 --> 01:53:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:44.470 --> 01:53:44.480 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions see none thank
 
01:53:47.910 --> 01:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:47.920 --> 01:53:49.030 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:53:49.030 --> 01:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:53:50.229 --> 01:53:50.239 align:start position:0%

on behalf of nami new hampshire i'm here

today to oppose
 
01:55:00.709 --> 01:55:00.719 align:start position:0%
house bill 1028
 
01:55:02.629 --> 01:55:02.639 align:start position:0%
as you've heard under current new
 
01:55:05.430 --> 01:55:05.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire law there is a restriction on
 
01:55:06.870 --> 01:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
these short-term
 
01:55:09.669 --> 01:55:09.679 align:start position:0%
limited duration plans
 
01:55:11.750 --> 01:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
that they can be no more than six months
 
01:55:15.270 --> 01:55:15.280 align:start position:0%
and there's restrictions on
 
01:55:17.270 --> 01:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
you know how many times they can be
 
01:55:19.589 --> 01:55:19.599 align:start position:0%
renewed and those are in place for a
 
01:55:22.070 --> 01:55:22.080 align:start position:0%
good reason
 
01:55:23.910 --> 01:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
especially for people with mental health
 
01:55:26.310 --> 01:55:26.320 align:start position:0%
conditions having access to affordable
 
01:55:26.320 --> 01:55:27.830 align:start position:0%
conditions having access to affordable
comprehensive

01:55:27.830 --> 01:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
comprehensive
 
01:55:30.149 --> 01:55:30.159 align:start position:0%
health insurance is critical for getting
 
01:55:32.550 --> 01:55:32.560 align:start position:0%
the mental health care they need
 
01:55:34.149 --> 01:55:34.159 align:start position:0%
the aca
 
01:55:35.430 --> 01:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
as we know
 
01:55:37.910 --> 01:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
set forth a lot of provisions that these
 
01:55:41.030 --> 01:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
plans do not have to follow
 
01:55:42.790 --> 01:55:42.800 align:start position:0%
one of them is the essential health
 
01:55:42.800 --> 01:55:45.189 align:start position:0%
one of them is the essential health
benefits

01:55:45.189 --> 01:55:45.199 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
01:55:47.270 --> 01:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
so they don't have to cover mental
 
01:55:50.629 --> 01:55:50.639 align:start position:0%
health or substance use disorder
 
01:55:52.550 --> 01:55:52.560 align:start position:0%
services they don't have to cover
 
01:55:52.560 --> 01:55:54.550 align:start position:0%
services they don't have to cover
prescriptions

01:55:54.550 --> 01:55:54.560 align:start position:0%
prescriptions
 
01:55:56.470 --> 01:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
as a matter of fact there was a survey
 
01:55:56.480 --> 01:55:58.390 align:start position:0%
as a matter of fact there was a survey
done

01:55:58.390 --> 01:55:58.400 align:start position:0%
done
 
01:56:00.229 --> 01:56:00.239 align:start position:0%
of a lot of these plans throughout the
 
01:56:01.990 --> 01:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
country and at the time there were two
 
01:56:04.229 --> 01:56:04.239 align:start position:0%
providers in new hampshire neither one
 
01:56:05.030 --> 01:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
of them
 
01:56:09.669 --> 01:56:09.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:12.550 --> 01:56:12.560 align:start position:0%
these short-term plans can reject
 
01:56:14.470 --> 01:56:14.480 align:start position:0%
applicants based on their mental health
 
01:56:14.480 --> 01:56:16.950 align:start position:0%
applicants based on their mental health
conditions

01:56:16.950 --> 01:56:16.960 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
01:56:18.550 --> 01:56:18.560 align:start position:0%
they can charge people with mental
 
01:56:21.109 --> 01:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
health conditions more than they charge
 
01:56:24.070 --> 01:56:24.080 align:start position:0%
people without mental health conditions
 
01:56:26.870 --> 01:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
they can exclude because exclude them
 
01:56:28.390 --> 01:56:28.400 align:start position:0%
from coverage because they have a
 
01:56:31.750 --> 01:56:31.760 align:start position:0%
pre-existing mental health condition
 
01:56:33.030 --> 01:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
again they don't have to cover the
 
01:56:36.149 --> 01:56:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:36.159 --> 01:56:37.830 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:56:37.830 --> 01:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:56:40.149 --> 01:56:40.159 align:start position:0%
one of the things that the sponsor had
 
01:56:41.510 --> 01:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned that sometimes with these
 
01:56:41.520 --> 01:56:42.790 align:start position:0%
mentioned that sometimes with these
plans

01:56:42.790 --> 01:56:42.800 align:start position:0%
plans
 
01:56:45.189 --> 01:56:45.199 align:start position:0%
somebody during that first initial six
 
01:56:48.070 --> 01:56:48.080 align:start position:0%
months will become sick
 
01:56:50.390 --> 01:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
and that six months doesn't allow them
 
01:56:52.229 --> 01:56:52.239 align:start position:0%
time to follow up with their care
 
01:56:54.070 --> 01:56:54.080 align:start position:0%
ongoing well guess what
 
01:56:55.669 --> 01:56:55.679 align:start position:0%
once you get sick you have a
 
01:56:57.669 --> 01:56:57.679 align:start position:0%
pre-existing condition
 
01:56:59.510 --> 01:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
and they do not have to renew your
 
01:56:59.520 --> 01:57:01.270 align:start position:0%
and they do not have to renew your
policy

01:57:01.270 --> 01:57:01.280 align:start position:0%
policy
 
01:57:01.280 --> 01:57:02.229 align:start position:0%
policy
so

01:57:02.229 --> 01:57:02.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:57:03.990 --> 01:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
you know all of a sudden you actually
 
01:57:06.709 --> 01:57:06.719 align:start position:0%
have an illness that needs coverage
 
01:57:08.790 --> 01:57:08.800 align:start position:0%
and at the end of that six months term
 
01:57:11.350 --> 01:57:11.360 align:start position:0%
they say see you later
 
01:57:14.390 --> 01:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
go find a major medical plan uh that
 
01:57:16.550 --> 01:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
falls under the aca we're not gonna
 
01:57:18.870 --> 01:57:18.880 align:start position:0%
renew your coverage for you
 
01:57:18.880 --> 01:57:19.830 align:start position:0%
renew your coverage for you
so

01:57:19.830 --> 01:57:19.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:57:21.830 --> 01:57:21.840 align:start position:0%
you know they've just paid for six
 
01:57:23.589 --> 01:57:23.599 align:start position:0%
months for a plan
 
01:57:24.870 --> 01:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:57:26.310 --> 01:57:26.320 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden they don't get to follow
 
01:57:27.750 --> 01:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
up with those providers they have to
 
01:57:30.149 --> 01:57:30.159 align:start position:0%
find a new plan so that's something that
 
01:57:32.390 --> 01:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
should be considered by this committee
 
01:57:32.400 --> 01:57:41.350 align:start position:0%
should be considered by this committee
um

01:57:41.350 --> 01:57:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:44.070 --> 01:57:44.080 align:start position:0%
there was a national study done that
 
01:57:45.669 --> 01:57:45.679 align:start position:0%
showed that 50
 
01:57:48.229 --> 01:57:48.239 align:start position:0%
of these plans across the country did
 
01:57:52.310 --> 01:57:52.320 align:start position:0%
not cover mental health and sud services
 
01:57:54.870 --> 01:57:54.880 align:start position:0%
which is huge
 
01:57:56.709 --> 01:57:56.719 align:start position:0%
and many as you've heard many of them
 
01:57:59.990 --> 01:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
are sold using deceptive tactics and
 
01:58:01.990 --> 01:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
i've included some footnotes in my
 
01:58:04.470 --> 01:58:04.480 align:start position:0%
testimony for the sources of those
 
01:58:06.629 --> 01:58:06.639 align:start position:0%
information you can certainly go and
 
01:58:08.870 --> 01:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
look up those reports and i've also
 
01:58:11.270 --> 01:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
included a
 
01:58:13.910 --> 01:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
i think it's a four-page report
 
01:58:15.510 --> 01:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
giving some information on these
 
01:58:17.189 --> 01:58:17.199 align:start position:0%
short-term plans
 
01:58:19.750 --> 01:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
that can be found on the nami national
 
01:58:19.760 --> 01:58:23.189 align:start position:0%
that can be found on the nami national
website

01:58:23.189 --> 01:58:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:25.350 --> 01:58:25.360 align:start position:0%
these plans are
 
01:58:26.950 --> 01:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
of particular
 
01:58:29.350 --> 01:58:29.360 align:start position:0%
interest to younger individuals because
 
01:58:31.350 --> 01:58:31.360 align:start position:0%
they are cheaper and they think okay
 
01:58:32.709 --> 01:58:32.719 align:start position:0%
it's cheaper
 
01:58:33.990 --> 01:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
you know i'm going to sign up for this
 
01:58:36.790 --> 01:58:36.800 align:start position:0%
plan not realizing that
 
01:58:38.229 --> 01:58:38.239 align:start position:0%
they're not getting what they think
 
01:58:39.589 --> 01:58:39.599 align:start position:0%
they're getting
 
01:58:42.310 --> 01:58:42.320 align:start position:0%
and the other thing that we know about
 
01:58:45.109 --> 01:58:45.119 align:start position:0%
mental illness is that
 
01:58:47.510 --> 01:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
symptoms for major mental illnesses
 
01:58:52.149 --> 01:58:52.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:52.159 --> 01:58:53.430 align:start position:0%
 
when

01:58:53.430 --> 01:58:53.440 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:58:55.589 --> 01:58:55.599 align:start position:0%
you know kids are in college when
 
01:58:58.390 --> 01:58:58.400 align:start position:0%
they're just leaving college
 
01:58:59.910 --> 01:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
or i should say young adults they're not
 
01:59:02.550 --> 01:59:02.560 align:start position:0%
kids at that point but these are the the
 
01:59:04.070 --> 01:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
individuals that these
 
01:59:06.950 --> 01:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
plans are targeted at
 
01:59:10.229 --> 01:59:10.239 align:start position:0%
and if they buy one of these plans and
 
01:59:12.390 --> 01:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
then have
 
01:59:14.830 --> 01:59:14.840 align:start position:0%
their first episode of psychosis
 
01:59:14.840 --> 01:59:16.390 align:start position:0%
their first episode of psychosis
say

01:59:16.390 --> 01:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:59:18.550 --> 01:59:18.560 align:start position:0%
and that plan doesn't cover any mental
 
01:59:20.070 --> 01:59:20.080 align:start position:0%
health treatment
 
01:59:21.990 --> 01:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
they've just played for a plan that they
 
01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:23.350 align:start position:0%
they've just played for a plan that they
have

01:59:23.350 --> 01:59:23.360 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:59:25.350 --> 01:59:25.360 align:start position:0%
there's nothing they it gives them
 
01:59:27.510 --> 01:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
nothing in return and you're talking
 
01:59:29.350 --> 01:59:29.360 align:start position:0%
about potentially
 
01:59:31.350 --> 01:59:31.360 align:start position:0%
being hospitalized
 
01:59:31.360 --> 01:59:32.149 align:start position:0%
being hospitalized
for

01:59:32.149 --> 01:59:32.159 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:59:35.270 --> 01:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
a significant period of time
 
01:59:37.910 --> 01:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
needing ongoing medications and needing
 
01:59:39.750 --> 01:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
ongoing treatment
 
01:59:42.149 --> 01:59:42.159 align:start position:0%
that the plan they just paid for
 
01:59:44.629 --> 01:59:44.639 align:start position:0%
is not going to cover
 
01:59:44.639 --> 01:59:46.390 align:start position:0%
is not going to cover
um

01:59:46.390 --> 01:59:46.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:47.430 --> 01:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
so they're going to have to end up
 
01:59:51.669 --> 01:59:51.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:54.629 --> 01:59:54.639 align:start position:0%
so you know in short these plans you
 
01:59:58.390 --> 01:59:58.400 align:start position:0%
know really fail to provide what they
 
02:00:01.750 --> 02:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
seem to provide on the surface
 
02:00:03.910 --> 02:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
and i think it really should hit home
 
02:00:06.149 --> 02:00:06.159 align:start position:0%
that if you get sick in that first six
 
02:00:07.750 --> 02:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
months there's a good chance you're not
 
02:00:11.669 --> 02:00:11.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:13.990 --> 02:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
because of the nature of the the plan so
 
02:00:15.830 --> 02:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
with that i just urge the committee to
 
02:00:18.149 --> 02:00:18.159 align:start position:0%
really seriously think about this
 
02:00:20.470 --> 02:00:20.480 align:start position:0%
um and
 
02:00:24.629 --> 02:00:24.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:27.830 --> 02:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
representative johnson has a question
 
02:00:29.350 --> 02:00:29.360 align:start position:0%
so my question thank you for taking my
 
02:00:29.360 --> 02:00:31.189 align:start position:0%
so my question thank you for taking my
question

02:00:31.189 --> 02:00:31.199 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:00:32.390 --> 02:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out the right way to
 
02:00:34.470 --> 02:00:34.480 align:start position:0%
word this so it doesn't come out
 
02:00:34.480 --> 02:00:36.709 align:start position:0%
word this so it doesn't come out
incorrectly

02:00:36.709 --> 02:00:36.719 align:start position:0%
incorrectly
 
02:00:36.719 --> 02:00:37.669 align:start position:0%
incorrectly
if

02:00:37.669 --> 02:00:37.679 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:00:40.790 --> 02:00:40.800 align:start position:0%
we open this up so that insurance
 
02:00:43.830 --> 02:00:43.840 align:start position:0%
providers can offer this to
 
02:00:46.149 --> 02:00:46.159 align:start position:0%
these individuals
 
02:00:48.550 --> 02:00:48.560 align:start position:0%
with knowing that they need to explain
 
02:00:51.910 --> 02:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
off doesn't that give the consumers a
 
02:00:55.350 --> 02:00:55.360 align:start position:0%
chance to look at all their options and
 
02:00:57.430 --> 02:00:57.440 align:start position:0%
it's isn't it the consumers
 
02:00:59.750 --> 02:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
who need to do their due diligence to
 
02:01:02.229 --> 02:01:02.239 align:start position:0%
make sure what they're asking for a plan
 
02:01:03.830 --> 02:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
is being offered and if they don't like
 
02:01:05.189 --> 02:01:05.199 align:start position:0%
what they're being offered they don't
 
02:01:06.950 --> 02:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
have to choose that plan aren't we
 
02:01:08.870 --> 02:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
restricting the consumers to make their
 
02:01:12.149 --> 02:01:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:16.310 --> 02:01:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:19.030 --> 02:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
the regulations that new hampshire put
 
02:01:21.589 --> 02:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
in place many years ago
 
02:01:24.870 --> 02:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
were put in place because
 
02:01:26.709 --> 02:01:26.719 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:01:28.709 --> 02:01:28.719 align:start position:0%
this committee and others like them felt
 
02:01:32.470 --> 02:01:32.480 align:start position:0%
that individuals needed to be protected
 
02:01:35.109 --> 02:01:35.119 align:start position:0%
the house commerce and consumer affairs
 
02:01:37.910 --> 02:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
committee and consumer affairs is a part
 
02:01:39.109 --> 02:01:39.119 align:start position:0%
of the name
 
02:01:41.669 --> 02:01:41.679 align:start position:0%
of this committee
 
02:01:45.750 --> 02:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
you know really is here to help
 
02:01:47.589 --> 02:01:47.599 align:start position:0%
protect consumers there's reasons that
 
02:01:50.390 --> 02:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
we have consumer protection laws
 
02:01:54.310 --> 02:01:54.320 align:start position:0%
and there are times when due to
 
02:01:56.790 --> 02:01:56.800 align:start position:0%
the way that things are marketed
 
02:01:59.109 --> 02:01:59.119 align:start position:0%
i i will tell you you know prior to
 
02:02:01.669 --> 02:02:01.679 align:start position:0%
coming to nami new hampshire i was the
 
02:02:03.030 --> 02:02:03.040 align:start position:0%
health policy
 
02:02:05.350 --> 02:02:05.360 align:start position:0%
coordinator at new futures for five
 
02:02:05.360 --> 02:02:06.709 align:start position:0%
coordinator at new futures for five
years

02:02:06.709 --> 02:02:06.719 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:02:09.910 --> 02:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
and i don't know how many conversations
 
02:02:13.350 --> 02:02:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:15.270 --> 02:02:15.280 align:start position:0%
who have no idea how their health plans
 
02:02:17.589 --> 02:02:17.599 align:start position:0%
work whether their employers sponsored
 
02:02:19.990 --> 02:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
plans self-insured plans
 
02:02:22.390 --> 02:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
so i mean i think that there are times
 
02:02:26.470 --> 02:02:26.480 align:start position:0%
that products are very very confusing
 
02:02:26.480 --> 02:02:27.669 align:start position:0%
that products are very very confusing
and

02:02:27.669 --> 02:02:27.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:02:29.589 --> 02:02:29.599 align:start position:0%
it's really difficult to educate
 
02:02:33.030 --> 02:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
yourself about what you're getting and
 
02:02:34.870 --> 02:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
you know young people
 
02:02:37.030 --> 02:02:37.040 align:start position:0%
think that they're not going to get sick
 
02:02:40.950 --> 02:02:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:42.870 --> 02:02:42.880 align:start position:0%
and so i would just say that you know
 
02:02:46.070 --> 02:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
part of this committee's job is to also
 
02:02:50.470 --> 02:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:53.430 --> 02:02:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:54.310 --> 02:02:54.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:02:56.550 --> 02:02:56.560 align:start position:0%
i believe that i heard from one of the
 
02:02:58.950 --> 02:02:58.960 align:start position:0%
previous uh speakers
 
02:03:01.589 --> 02:03:01.599 align:start position:0%
that there either are uh
 
02:03:03.990 --> 02:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
no companies or only one company that
 
02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:05.189 align:start position:0%
no companies or only one company that
provides

02:03:05.189 --> 02:03:05.199 align:start position:0%
provides
 
02:03:07.669 --> 02:03:07.679 align:start position:0%
short-term policies
 
02:03:07.679 --> 02:03:09.430 align:start position:0%
short-term policies
uh

02:03:09.430 --> 02:03:09.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:03:11.589 --> 02:03:11.599 align:start position:0%
so what what's the situation for the
 
02:03:13.350 --> 02:03:13.360 align:start position:0%
folks that you're talking about right
 
02:03:15.910 --> 02:03:15.920 align:start position:0%
now when there's only
 
02:03:17.750 --> 02:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
one well it's not even an option because
 
02:03:18.790 --> 02:03:18.800 align:start position:0%
you have to have more than one to have
 
02:03:21.750 --> 02:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
an option when you only got one
 
02:03:24.790 --> 02:03:24.800 align:start position:0%
and how would this bill be any worse
 
02:03:28.070 --> 02:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
than the situation that exists right now
 
02:03:30.790 --> 02:03:30.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:03:33.510 --> 02:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
there is only one right now but as you
 
02:03:35.270 --> 02:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
heard the reason there's only one right
 
02:03:37.350 --> 02:03:37.360 align:start position:0%
now is because
 
02:03:39.430 --> 02:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has tight restrictions on
 
02:03:41.430 --> 02:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
these policies you lift those
 
02:03:43.669 --> 02:03:43.679 align:start position:0%
restrictions and you could have numerous
 
02:03:47.510 --> 02:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:47.520 --> 02:03:48.709 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:03:48.709 --> 02:03:48.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:03:51.109 --> 02:03:51.119 align:start position:0%
these will not be targeted just at that
 
02:03:54.550 --> 02:03:54.560 align:start position:0%
five percent of individuals who do not
 
02:03:56.470 --> 02:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
currently have insurance
 
02:03:59.510 --> 02:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
there is nothing in this bill that says
 
02:04:03.589 --> 02:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
you know if you are below 400 percent of
 
02:04:05.510 --> 02:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
the federal poverty level
 
02:04:07.270 --> 02:04:07.280 align:start position:0%
and therefore
 
02:04:08.629 --> 02:04:08.639 align:start position:0%
are covered
 
02:04:10.790 --> 02:04:10.800 align:start position:0%
have have the ability to get subsidies
 
02:04:12.950 --> 02:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
on the aca plan
 
02:04:12.960 --> 02:04:14.149 align:start position:0%
on the aca plan
um

02:04:14.149 --> 02:04:14.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:17.510 --> 02:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:19.750 --> 02:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
get a short-term plan instead there's
 
02:04:22.550 --> 02:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
nothing that's in there that says that
 
02:04:24.149 --> 02:04:24.159 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in there that says if
 
02:04:26.310 --> 02:04:26.320 align:start position:0%
you were afforded you know health care
 
02:04:28.629 --> 02:04:28.639 align:start position:0%
under your employer
 
02:04:32.229 --> 02:04:32.239 align:start position:0%
that um and a lot of employers do allow
 
02:04:34.950 --> 02:04:34.960 align:start position:0%
you to turn down their insurance
 
02:04:37.430 --> 02:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't say that you know you
 
02:04:39.830 --> 02:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
can't turn down that coverage
 
02:04:41.270 --> 02:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
and get one of these plans and get a
 
02:04:44.629 --> 02:04:44.639 align:start position:0%
stipend from your from your employer
 
02:04:44.639 --> 02:04:48.550 align:start position:0%
stipend from your from your employer
so

02:04:48.550 --> 02:04:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:50.310 --> 02:04:50.320 align:start position:0%
again i mean if you're only looking at
 
02:04:52.550 --> 02:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
that five percent versus nothing versus
 
02:04:52.560 --> 02:04:54.069 align:start position:0%
that five percent versus nothing versus
this

02:04:54.069 --> 02:04:54.079 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:04:55.430 --> 02:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
that's one thing but that's not what
 
02:04:57.189 --> 02:04:57.199 align:start position:0%
you're looking at you're looking at a
 
02:04:59.189 --> 02:04:59.199 align:start position:0%
hundred percent of new hampshire
 
02:05:01.350 --> 02:05:01.360 align:start position:0%
residents being able to buy one of those
 
02:05:01.360 --> 02:05:03.830 align:start position:0%
residents being able to buy one of those
plans

02:05:03.830 --> 02:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:06.790 --> 02:05:06.800 align:start position:0%
for the question main query
 
02:05:06.800 --> 02:05:07.589 align:start position:0%
for the question main query
so

02:05:07.589 --> 02:05:07.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:05:07.599 --> 02:05:08.950 align:start position:0%
so
how

02:05:08.950 --> 02:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
how
 
02:05:11.350 --> 02:05:11.360 align:start position:0%
given that i believe that one of the
 
02:05:13.990 --> 02:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
states that was cited was florida with
 
02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:15.430 align:start position:0%
states that was cited was florida with
seven

02:05:15.430 --> 02:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
seven
 
02:05:18.709 --> 02:05:18.719 align:start position:0%
uh providers under their their law
 
02:05:20.470 --> 02:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
i i don't know whether you're familiar
 
02:05:22.390 --> 02:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
with the situation
 
02:05:24.950 --> 02:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
in florida i guess i'm asking that
 
02:05:27.189 --> 02:05:27.199 align:start position:0%
or an another state where
 
02:05:29.430 --> 02:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
the there are multiple
 
02:05:34.149 --> 02:05:34.159 align:start position:0%
carriers that are in the market
 
02:05:36.550 --> 02:05:36.560 align:start position:0%
with respect to the concerns that you're
 
02:05:38.550 --> 02:05:38.560 align:start position:0%
raising for the particular group of
 
02:05:41.750 --> 02:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
people with the mental health issues
 
02:05:43.990 --> 02:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
are they are they worse off or better
 
02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:44.950 align:start position:0%
are they are they worse off or better
off

02:05:44.950 --> 02:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
off
 
02:05:46.310 --> 02:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
with those
 
02:05:49.750 --> 02:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
types of policies than than the existing
 
02:05:52.069 --> 02:05:52.079 align:start position:0%
situation in new hampshire
 
02:05:53.750 --> 02:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
or are you saying that the existing
 
02:05:53.760 --> 02:05:54.790 align:start position:0%
or are you saying that the existing
state

02:05:54.790 --> 02:05:54.800 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:05:56.790 --> 02:05:56.800 align:start position:0%
of affairs here in new hampshire is
 
02:05:59.030 --> 02:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
actually better for folks with mental
 
02:06:02.069 --> 02:06:02.079 align:start position:0%
health issues and that under this bill
 
02:06:02.079 --> 02:06:03.350 align:start position:0%
health issues and that under this bill
or

02:06:03.350 --> 02:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:06:05.990 --> 02:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
in other states that have options that
 
02:06:09.750 --> 02:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:12.229 --> 02:06:12.239 align:start position:0%
i don't have any information about other
 
02:06:15.270 --> 02:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
states um
 
02:06:15.280 --> 02:06:16.550 align:start position:0%
states um
but

02:06:16.550 --> 02:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:06:19.669 --> 02:06:19.679 align:start position:0%
you know knowing that these plans a lot
 
02:06:22.870 --> 02:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
of times don't even cover
 
02:06:25.589 --> 02:06:25.599 align:start position:0%
the services that those folks would need
 
02:06:28.069 --> 02:06:28.079 align:start position:0%
they would be paying a monthly premium
 
02:06:31.350 --> 02:06:31.360 align:start position:0%
premium and i believe that um it was
 
02:06:32.709 --> 02:06:32.719 align:start position:0%
cited that they're around two hundred
 
02:06:34.950 --> 02:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
dollars a month so if you're paying
 
02:06:37.030 --> 02:06:37.040 align:start position:0%
you know 200 a month for something that
 
02:06:39.910 --> 02:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
you can't even use i would say that
 
02:06:41.750 --> 02:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
you're in a worse position
 
02:06:44.629 --> 02:06:44.639 align:start position:0%
so so excuse me just one file so are you
 
02:06:47.350 --> 02:06:47.360 align:start position:0%
suggesting that we'd be going from good
 
02:06:53.270 --> 02:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:54.950 --> 02:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
i don't know the answer to that question
 
02:06:56.629 --> 02:06:56.639 align:start position:0%
so you don't know whether this bill
 
02:06:58.950 --> 02:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
you've spoken against the bill yes so is
 
02:07:00.229 --> 02:07:00.239 align:start position:0%
it worse
 
02:07:02.149 --> 02:07:02.159 align:start position:0%
it's absolutely going to be worse i mean
 
02:07:04.310 --> 02:07:04.320 align:start position:0%
i don't know that we're good that's the
 
02:07:06.870 --> 02:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
the caveat bad
 
02:07:09.030 --> 02:07:09.040 align:start position:0%
bad currently and it'll be worse under
 
02:07:10.709 --> 02:07:10.719 align:start position:0%
this bill or it's good and it's going to
 
02:07:14.470 --> 02:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
be drastically worse i don't
 
02:07:16.390 --> 02:07:16.400 align:start position:0%
represent if i don't have the numbers of
 
02:07:18.950 --> 02:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
how many individuals with mental illness
 
02:07:21.910 --> 02:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
young folks currently are uninsured but
 
02:07:23.430 --> 02:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
i can certainly try to find that out
 
02:07:25.750 --> 02:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
uninsured in new hampshire for you
 
02:07:27.270 --> 02:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
if that would be helpful
 
02:07:31.669 --> 02:07:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:33.910 --> 02:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
02:07:35.189 --> 02:07:35.199 align:start position:0%
see none thank you very much for your
 
02:07:35.199 --> 02:07:37.270 align:start position:0%
see none thank you very much for your
testimony

02:07:37.270 --> 02:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:07:51.189 --> 02:07:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:51.199 --> 02:07:52.310 align:start position:0%
 
right

02:07:52.310 --> 02:07:52.320 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:07:53.910 --> 02:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman honorable
 
02:07:55.430 --> 02:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is jake
 
02:07:57.189 --> 02:07:57.199 align:start position:0%
berry i'm the vice president of policy
 
02:07:59.350 --> 02:07:59.360 align:start position:0%
at new futures as many of you know new
 
02:08:01.189 --> 02:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
future is a non-partisan nonprofit
 
02:08:03.750 --> 02:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
health policy and advocacy organization
 
02:08:05.270 --> 02:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
we've been working for a number of years
 
02:08:07.430 --> 02:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
to increase access to quality affordable
 
02:08:10.149 --> 02:08:10.159 align:start position:0%
health care in this state
 
02:08:11.750 --> 02:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
i don't want to repeat too much of what
 
02:08:13.750 --> 02:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
has been said already this morning but i
 
02:08:15.589 --> 02:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
do want to emphasize new futures strong
 
02:08:17.589 --> 02:08:17.599 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill
 
02:08:18.950 --> 02:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
the federal protections that have been
 
02:08:21.109 --> 02:08:21.119 align:start position:0%
so spoken about repeatedly
 
02:08:22.950 --> 02:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
that were put in place by the affordable
 
02:08:24.550 --> 02:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
care act they're a real thing they've
 
02:08:27.350 --> 02:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
really gone far to increase access to
 
02:08:29.109 --> 02:08:29.119 align:start position:0%
mental health as holly just mentioned to
 
02:08:31.350 --> 02:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
substance use treatment to the other
 
02:08:34.149 --> 02:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
essential health benefits including
 
02:08:36.790 --> 02:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
emergency care maternity care child
 
02:08:39.830 --> 02:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
birth care so on and so forth uh
 
02:08:41.830 --> 02:08:41.840 align:start position:0%
under this bill short term health plans
 
02:08:43.669 --> 02:08:43.679 align:start position:0%
aren't required to cover any of this as
 
02:08:45.589 --> 02:08:45.599 align:start position:0%
you have heard and in fact many of them
 
02:08:46.950 --> 02:08:46.960 align:start position:0%
do not
 
02:08:46.960 --> 02:08:47.830 align:start position:0%
do not
a

02:08:47.830 --> 02:08:47.840 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:08:49.589 --> 02:08:49.599 align:start position:0%
2018 study that i was looking at from
 
02:08:52.390 --> 02:08:52.400 align:start position:0%
the kaiser family foundation found that
 
02:08:55.270 --> 02:08:55.280 align:start position:0%
43 percent of short-term health plans
 
02:08:57.030 --> 02:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
across the country cover
 
02:08:59.270 --> 02:08:59.280 align:start position:0%
mental health uh i'm sorry do not cover
 
02:09:01.830 --> 02:09:01.840 align:start position:0%
mental health 62 do not cover substance
 
02:09:03.830 --> 02:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
use treatment and not a single plan
 
02:09:06.229 --> 02:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
covered maternity care i will note that
 
02:09:08.310 --> 02:09:08.320 align:start position:0%
these are some benefits that are most
 
02:09:09.750 --> 02:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
essential to the
 
02:09:11.910 --> 02:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
or that are supremely essential to the
 
02:09:13.750 --> 02:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
younger population that uh that was
 
02:09:15.109 --> 02:09:15.119 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier as a
 
02:09:17.990 --> 02:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
particular target for these plans
 
02:09:20.310 --> 02:09:20.320 align:start position:0%
so essentially these plans
 
02:09:22.149 --> 02:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
have lesser coverage
 
02:09:23.910 --> 02:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
they lead to higher out-of-pocket costs
 
02:09:25.510 --> 02:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
for consumers
 
02:09:27.910 --> 02:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
decreased access to care for consumers
 
02:09:29.669 --> 02:09:29.679 align:start position:0%
greater uncompensated care which as
 
02:09:31.830 --> 02:09:31.840 align:start position:0%
we've seen in your past to higher health
 
02:09:34.870 --> 02:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
care across all across the spectrum and
 
02:09:36.709 --> 02:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
generally lead to poorer health outcomes
 
02:09:38.629 --> 02:09:38.639 align:start position:0%
i would say that unlike our current
 
02:09:38.639 --> 02:09:39.750 align:start position:0%
i would say that unlike our current
plans

02:09:39.750 --> 02:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
plans
 
02:09:41.350 --> 02:09:41.360 align:start position:0%
these plans are not not only not
 
02:09:42.950 --> 02:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
comprehensive in many cases they're
 
02:09:42.960 --> 02:09:44.470 align:start position:0%
comprehensive in many cases they're
predatory

02:09:44.470 --> 02:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
predatory
 
02:09:47.109 --> 02:09:47.119 align:start position:0%
and so i i would strongly uh uh urge you
 
02:09:48.950 --> 02:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
to uh oppose this bill vote this bill
 
02:09:48.960 --> 02:09:50.629 align:start position:0%
to uh oppose this bill vote this bill
itl

02:09:50.629 --> 02:09:50.639 align:start position:0%
itl
 
02:09:51.750 --> 02:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to take questions
 
02:09:51.760 --> 02:09:54.550 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to take questions
predatory

02:09:54.550 --> 02:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
predatory
 
02:09:58.390 --> 02:09:58.400 align:start position:0%
why are they predatory it's a and it's a
 
02:10:00.069 --> 02:10:00.079 align:start position:0%
strong word i should say but i think
 
02:10:02.149 --> 02:10:02.159 align:start position:0%
that they um
 
02:10:04.709 --> 02:10:04.719 align:start position:0%
many of them again uh you know we've
 
02:10:06.229 --> 02:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
talked about their their marketing
 
02:10:07.750 --> 02:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
practices and their sort of lack of
 
02:10:09.510 --> 02:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
transparency around the benefits that
 
02:10:12.550 --> 02:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
they provide i think that they charge
 
02:10:15.270 --> 02:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
a you know monthly premiums to people
 
02:10:16.870 --> 02:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
knowing that these people are not aware
 
02:10:18.229 --> 02:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
of the benefits that they will or will
 
02:10:21.270 --> 02:10:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:21.280 --> 02:10:23.830 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:10:23.830 --> 02:10:23.840 align:start position:0%

the american heart association
 
02:11:29.669 --> 02:11:29.679 align:start position:0%
appreciates this opportunity
 
02:11:31.669 --> 02:11:31.679 align:start position:0%
to be able to offer comments in
 
02:11:34.870 --> 02:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
opposition to house bill 1028
 
02:11:37.669 --> 02:11:37.679 align:start position:0%
primarily around our concerns on the
 
02:11:39.910 --> 02:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
lack of consumer protections
 
02:11:41.830 --> 02:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
short-term limited duration plans
 
02:11:45.189 --> 02:11:45.199 align:start position:0%
originally meant to be you know coverage
 
02:11:47.589 --> 02:11:47.599 align:start position:0%
for gaps such as in between jobs or
 
02:11:49.109 --> 02:11:49.119 align:start position:0%
young adults coming off their parents
 
02:11:50.790 --> 02:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
insurance plan
 
02:11:52.629 --> 02:11:52.639 align:start position:0%
but only for those individuals who do
 
02:11:55.350 --> 02:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
not have pre-existing conditions
 
02:11:57.270 --> 02:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
short-term plans as
 
02:11:59.510 --> 02:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
others have said provide the same cut do
 
02:12:00.950 --> 02:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
not provide the same coverage that
 
02:12:02.950 --> 02:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
people have come to expect traditional
 
02:12:04.390 --> 02:12:04.400 align:start position:0%
health insurance
 
02:12:05.910 --> 02:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
and if these plans are allowed to be
 
02:12:07.510 --> 02:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
sold in new hampshire for longer time
 
02:12:09.990 --> 02:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
periods with unlimited renewals an
 
02:12:11.669 --> 02:12:11.679 align:start position:0%
individual's health status could change
 
02:12:12.790 --> 02:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
and they could end up facing
 
02:12:15.270 --> 02:12:15.280 align:start position:0%
considerable financial risk
 
02:12:15.280 --> 02:12:16.310 align:start position:0%
considerable financial risk
from

02:12:16.310 --> 02:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:12:16.320 --> 02:12:17.910 align:start position:0%
from
unexpected

02:12:17.910 --> 02:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
unexpected
 
02:12:17.920 --> 02:12:19.030 align:start position:0%
unexpected
illness

02:12:19.030 --> 02:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
illness
 
02:12:21.510 --> 02:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
and the the cost of health care services
 
02:12:22.870 --> 02:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
that would not be
 
02:12:27.350 --> 02:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:29.669 --> 02:12:29.679 align:start position:0%
while short-term limited duration plans
 
02:12:32.229 --> 02:12:32.239 align:start position:0%
can offer cheaper premiums for consumers
 
02:12:34.069 --> 02:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
they are not required to adhere to
 
02:12:35.910 --> 02:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
important standards including coverage
 
02:12:38.310 --> 02:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
of state mandated health benefits age
 
02:12:39.990 --> 02:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
and gender rating prohibitions on
 
02:12:41.430 --> 02:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
discriminating against people with
 
02:12:43.510 --> 02:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
pre-existing conditions the annual
 
02:12:45.910 --> 02:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
out-of-pocket maximums
 
02:12:47.910 --> 02:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
nor the prohibitions on annual and
 
02:12:50.229 --> 02:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
lifetime coverage limits
 
02:12:51.910 --> 02:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
limiting the duration and renewability
 
02:12:53.270 --> 02:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
of short-term plans as the state
 
02:12:55.270 --> 02:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
currently does allows a market for the
 
02:12:57.510 --> 02:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
product but only as a temporary coverage
 
02:13:00.149 --> 02:13:00.159 align:start position:0%
options limits on short-term plans can
 
02:13:02.950 --> 02:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
also make it more obvious to consumers
 
02:13:04.550 --> 02:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
shopping for coverage that these are a
 
02:13:06.229 --> 02:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
different type of insurance
 
02:13:08.629 --> 02:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
product intended only for temporary
 
02:13:08.639 --> 02:13:09.669 align:start position:0%
product intended only for temporary
coverage

02:13:09.669 --> 02:13:09.679 align:start position:0%
coverage
 
02:13:11.350 --> 02:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for your consideration of the
 
02:13:13.189 --> 02:13:13.199 align:start position:0%

uh

02:14:12.069 --> 02:14:12.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:12.079 --> 02:14:30.870 align:start position:0%

02:14:46.629 --> 02:14:46.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:14:49.830 --> 02:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
and members of commerce
 
02:14:54.149 --> 02:14:54.159 align:start position:0%
um i'm betty gay and i represent salem
 
02:14:57.270 --> 02:14:57.280 align:start position:0%
i'm very concerned about people who got
 
02:15:00.229 --> 02:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
bad reactions to vaccines
 
02:15:02.310 --> 02:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
even though they're in the
 
02:15:04.709 --> 02:15:04.719 align:start position:0%
small percentage if it happens to them
 
02:15:06.550 --> 02:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
it's a hundred percent
 
02:15:06.560 --> 02:15:07.350 align:start position:0%
it's a hundred percent
and

02:15:07.350 --> 02:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:15:09.350 --> 02:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
if you're interested if you haven't seen
 
02:15:14.629 --> 02:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:16.950 --> 02:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
is a place that you can read about these
 
02:15:18.310 --> 02:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
very wide
 
02:15:20.390 --> 02:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
very different kind of responses that
 
02:15:22.550 --> 02:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
some people's bodies have done
 
02:15:25.910 --> 02:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
and i was horrified to find out that
 
02:15:28.310 --> 02:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
if you get a reaction
 
02:15:30.470 --> 02:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
to a
 
02:15:31.750 --> 02:15:31.760 align:start position:0%
a treatment
 
02:15:34.149 --> 02:15:34.159 align:start position:0%
like a vaccine is a treatment
 
02:15:35.990 --> 02:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
if you get a bad reaction to one that
 
02:15:39.350 --> 02:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
does not have full-fledged fda approval
 
02:15:41.830 --> 02:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
and all you know so far
 
02:15:43.350 --> 02:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
excuse me all
 
02:15:46.149 --> 02:15:46.159 align:start position:0%
all vaccines except for one
 
02:15:48.069 --> 02:15:48.079 align:start position:0%
that we don't even have
 
02:15:48.079 --> 02:15:48.870 align:start position:0%
that we don't even have
uh

02:15:48.870 --> 02:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:15:51.350 --> 02:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
were released under emergency
 
02:15:51.360 --> 02:15:53.350 align:start position:0%
were released under emergency
authorization

02:15:53.350 --> 02:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
authorization
 
02:15:55.270 --> 02:15:55.280 align:start position:0%
so under current law if you have
 
02:15:57.270 --> 02:15:57.280 align:start position:0%
something that if you have any kind of
 
02:15:59.270 --> 02:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
treatment that is not
 
02:16:03.589 --> 02:16:03.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:05.430 --> 02:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
your insurance company is not obligated
 
02:16:07.910 --> 02:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
to cover the treatment for that
 
02:16:10.390 --> 02:16:10.400 align:start position:0%
so i thought it was going to be just
 
02:16:13.430 --> 02:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
really simple and unfortunately the to
 
02:16:16.310 --> 02:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
me this bill looks has almost like a
 
02:16:18.470 --> 02:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
double negative in it but it gets
 
02:16:20.950 --> 02:16:20.960 align:start position:0%
scrambled by legislative services yes so
 
02:16:22.629 --> 02:16:22.639 align:start position:0%
let's just stick to what your intent is
 
02:16:24.229 --> 02:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
and don't worry about the wording okay
 
02:16:25.910 --> 02:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
we'll figure that out thank you you can
 
02:16:27.109 --> 02:16:27.119 align:start position:0%
fix it
 
02:16:29.830 --> 02:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
um oh and then right now there's a hard
 
02:16:31.910 --> 02:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
there's a glitch there's a bug in the
 
02:16:35.349 --> 02:16:35.359 align:start position:0%
rsa look up on our website
 
02:16:37.589 --> 02:16:37.599 align:start position:0%
so but they're working on it
 
02:16:40.870 --> 02:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
okay so if you can see on the bill the
 
02:16:43.270 --> 02:16:43.280 align:start position:0%
coverage the old words are covered for
 
02:16:46.150 --> 02:16:46.160 align:start position:0%
experimental or investigational drugs or
 
02:16:48.230 --> 02:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
really it's in the list of what is not
 
02:16:50.709 --> 02:16:50.719 align:start position:0%
covered by insurance so they modified it
 
02:16:52.950 --> 02:16:52.960 align:start position:0%
to add besides experimental or
 
02:16:56.150 --> 02:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
investigational drugs vaccines devices
 
02:16:58.549 --> 02:16:58.559 align:start position:0%
medications are the reactions to them
 
02:17:00.870 --> 02:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
the important thing is or the reactions
 
02:17:03.190 --> 02:17:03.200 align:start position:0%
to them
 
02:17:05.429 --> 02:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
if they're not approved by the fda
 
02:17:05.439 --> 02:17:06.629 align:start position:0%
if they're not approved by the fda
but

02:17:06.629 --> 02:17:06.639 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:17:08.870 --> 02:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
what it's saying
 
02:17:10.309 --> 02:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
that has been
 
02:17:12.469 --> 02:17:12.479 align:start position:0%
unless they're authorized by emergency
 
02:17:16.469 --> 02:17:16.479 align:start position:0%
use so that just adds in that it's
 
02:17:19.349 --> 02:17:19.359 align:start position:0%
emergency authorization would cover
 
02:17:22.070 --> 02:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
those reactions too
 
02:17:23.830 --> 02:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
and so they apparently was in two
 
02:17:26.709 --> 02:17:26.719 align:start position:0%
different rsa so it's almost the same
 
02:17:31.030 --> 02:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:33.110 --> 02:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
good so hopefully this is the simplest
 
02:17:35.750 --> 02:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
bill you have to look at today so simply
 
02:17:38.150 --> 02:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
that that if uh if you did have an
 
02:17:38.160 --> 02:17:39.110 align:start position:0%
that that if uh if you did have an
adverse

02:17:39.110 --> 02:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
adverse
 
02:17:40.629 --> 02:17:40.639 align:start position:0%
effect you don't want the insurance
 
02:17:41.750 --> 02:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
companies to
 
02:17:44.790 --> 02:17:44.800 align:start position:0%
not cover it simply because it was not
 
02:17:47.910 --> 02:17:47.920 align:start position:0%
uh officially approved it will be
 
02:17:49.190 --> 02:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
it's actually it's interesting because
 
02:17:51.190 --> 02:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
it's the first paragraph in the off
 
02:17:53.190 --> 02:17:53.200 align:start position:0%
label prescription and i was around when
 
02:17:54.950 --> 02:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
we passed that statute
 
02:17:57.349 --> 02:17:57.359 align:start position:0%
which was that you're if you were you
 
02:17:57.359 --> 02:17:58.469 align:start position:0%
which was that you're if you were you
know

02:17:58.469 --> 02:17:58.479 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:18:00.629 --> 02:18:00.639 align:start position:0%
using a medication for something that it
 
02:18:03.750 --> 02:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
was not originally designed for so
 
02:18:05.509 --> 02:18:05.519 align:start position:0%
and you had a bad reaction and you had
 
02:18:07.270 --> 02:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
well in that case you know you it would
 
02:18:08.549 --> 02:18:08.559 align:start position:0%
be covered the insurance companies would
 
02:18:10.709 --> 02:18:10.719 align:start position:0%
still cover it so all you want to do is
 
02:18:12.709 --> 02:18:12.719 align:start position:0%
make sure insurance companies cover you
 
02:18:12.719 --> 02:18:14.230 align:start position:0%
make sure insurance companies cover you
regardless

02:18:14.230 --> 02:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
regardless
 
02:18:16.309 --> 02:18:16.319 align:start position:0%
uh well excuse me they're the regard it
 
02:18:17.990 --> 02:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
had to be if you had to had the
 
02:18:20.469 --> 02:18:20.479 align:start position:0%
emergency use approved by the fda if it
 
02:18:23.110 --> 02:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
did then you want whatever the
 
02:18:24.950 --> 02:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
the symptoms
 
02:18:27.030 --> 02:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
be covered by the insurance company
 
02:18:28.950 --> 02:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for your wording
 
02:18:28.960 --> 02:18:29.990 align:start position:0%
thank you for your wording
okay

02:18:29.990 --> 02:18:30.000 align:start position:0%

um
 
02:19:09.509 --> 02:19:09.519 align:start position:0%
i support this uh this legislation
 
02:19:11.990 --> 02:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
because there's been a very strong push
 
02:19:15.750 --> 02:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
for folks to use the the covid vaccines
 
02:19:17.830 --> 02:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
yet they were approved with emergency
 
02:19:22.150 --> 02:19:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:23.589 --> 02:19:23.599 align:start position:0%
and until
 
02:19:25.910 --> 02:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
late fall
 
02:19:25.920 --> 02:19:28.070 align:start position:0%
late fall
pfizer

02:19:28.070 --> 02:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
pfizer
 
02:19:32.150 --> 02:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
finally got full approval but only for
 
02:19:32.160 --> 02:19:33.910 align:start position:0%
finally got full approval but only for
adults

02:19:33.910 --> 02:19:33.920 align:start position:0%
adults
 
02:19:36.549 --> 02:19:36.559 align:start position:0%
and last week modernist vaccine got
 
02:19:36.559 --> 02:19:37.589 align:start position:0%
and last week modernist vaccine got
approval

02:19:37.589 --> 02:19:37.599 align:start position:0%
approval
 
02:19:39.830 --> 02:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
again only for adults
 
02:19:39.840 --> 02:19:40.790 align:start position:0%
again only for adults
so

02:19:40.790 --> 02:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:19:43.830 --> 02:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
emergency youth authorization
 
02:19:46.309 --> 02:19:46.319 align:start position:0%
still stands for
 
02:19:49.830 --> 02:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
children and and younger adults and if
 
02:19:52.230 --> 02:19:52.240 align:start position:0%
you look at the vares database that's
 
02:19:52.240 --> 02:19:53.270 align:start position:0%
you look at the vares database that's
the

02:19:53.270 --> 02:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:19:56.710 --> 02:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
vaccine adverse event reporting system
 
02:20:00.150 --> 02:20:00.160 align:start position:0%
the number of adverse events for these
 
02:20:03.270 --> 02:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
vaccines are substantially higher than
 
02:20:05.910 --> 02:20:05.920 align:start position:0%
traditional vaccines
 
02:20:05.920 --> 02:20:08.230 align:start position:0%
traditional vaccines
so

02:20:08.230 --> 02:20:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:11.190 --> 02:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
young men are experiencing myocarditis
 
02:20:13.429 --> 02:20:13.439 align:start position:0%
young women are experiencing fertility
 
02:20:13.439 --> 02:20:14.790 align:start position:0%
young women are experiencing fertility
problems

02:20:14.790 --> 02:20:14.800 align:start position:0%
problems
 
02:20:16.790 --> 02:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
and yet because
 
02:20:18.389 --> 02:20:18.399 align:start position:0%
of the way the insurance rules are
 
02:20:18.399 --> 02:20:19.910 align:start position:0%
of the way the insurance rules are
written

02:20:19.910 --> 02:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
written
 
02:20:22.710 --> 02:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
emergency use authorization
 
02:20:24.550 --> 02:20:24.560 align:start position:0%
products are not covered by their
 
02:20:27.030 --> 02:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
insurance and so what we want to do is
 
02:20:31.270 --> 02:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:33.270 --> 02:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
good representative bartlett
 
02:20:35.750 --> 02:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i'd like you to um
 
02:20:39.590 --> 02:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
cite the information regarding um women
 
02:20:42.230 --> 02:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
having problems with fertility and men
 
02:20:42.240 --> 02:20:43.190 align:start position:0%
having problems with fertility and men
with

02:20:43.190 --> 02:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:20:46.469 --> 02:20:46.479 align:start position:0%
myocarditis it's in the vares database
 
02:20:46.479 --> 02:20:49.990 align:start position:0%
myocarditis it's in the vares database

02:20:52.469 --> 02:20:52.479 align:start position:0%
federal database you can check those
 
02:20:53.910 --> 02:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
numbers i didn't bring those numbers
 
02:20:58.469 --> 02:20:58.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:00.469 --> 02:21:00.479 align:start position:0%
well let's just take infertility uh
 
02:21:02.630 --> 02:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
since we now have that mandate in new
 
02:21:02.640 --> 02:21:03.990 align:start position:0%
since we now have that mandate in new
hampshire

02:21:03.990 --> 02:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:05.750 align:start position:0%
hampshire
um

02:21:05.750 --> 02:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:07.590 --> 02:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
is there any report where an insurance
 
02:21:10.550 --> 02:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
company would not cover the infertility
 
02:21:12.630 --> 02:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
coverage because
 
02:21:16.230 --> 02:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
they said it was due to
 
02:21:16.240 --> 02:21:17.270 align:start position:0%
they said it was due to
this

02:21:17.270 --> 02:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:21:18.710 --> 02:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
a vaccine
 
02:21:20.150 --> 02:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
02:21:22.070 --> 02:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
i i can't give you any particular
 
02:21:25.190 --> 02:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
citation i just i'm aware of the fact
 
02:21:28.230 --> 02:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
that the database is suggesting that
 
02:21:28.240 --> 02:21:29.750 align:start position:0%
that the database is suggesting that
uh

02:21:29.750 --> 02:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:21:31.750 --> 02:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
that the there was a potential bad
 
02:21:33.910 --> 02:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
outcome that there's a potential for
 
02:21:35.990 --> 02:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
over accumulation
 
02:21:39.190 --> 02:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
of the vaccine causing uh infertility
 
02:21:43.270 --> 02:21:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:44.630 --> 02:21:44.640 align:start position:0%

um

02:21:47.670 --> 02:21:47.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:49.750 --> 02:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
so the department of defense maintains
 
02:21:51.110 --> 02:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
its own
 
02:21:54.230 --> 02:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
vaccine database does it not yes it does
 
02:21:58.150 --> 02:21:58.160 align:start position:0%
um and this is a more robust in-depth
 
02:22:00.070 --> 02:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
collection of data
 
02:22:02.150 --> 02:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
more robust in that the
 
02:22:04.870 --> 02:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
only people that can enter data into the
 
02:22:04.880 --> 02:22:06.230 align:start position:0%
only people that can enter data into the
dod

02:22:06.230 --> 02:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
dod
 
02:22:09.110 --> 02:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
database are physicians as opposed as
 
02:22:11.750 --> 02:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
opposed to the vares database you can
 
02:22:13.110 --> 02:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
have public
 
02:22:15.270 --> 02:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
entry of data correct
 
02:22:17.349 --> 02:22:17.359 align:start position:0%
according to the dod's database there
 
02:22:19.429 --> 02:22:19.439 align:start position:0%
has been a hundred percent a thousand
 
02:22:21.750 --> 02:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
percent increase in neurological
 
02:22:23.990 --> 02:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
neurological issues
 
02:22:26.070 --> 02:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
and 300
 
02:22:28.630 --> 02:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
percent increase in miscarriages and
 
02:22:33.510 --> 02:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:34.830 --> 02:22:34.840 align:start position:0%
so my question
 
02:22:37.510 --> 02:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
is are all these data points just
 
02:22:40.550 --> 02:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
anti-vaxxed fairy tales or i mean are
 
02:22:40.560 --> 02:22:41.429 align:start position:0%
anti-vaxxed fairy tales or i mean are
these

02:22:41.429 --> 02:22:41.439 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:22:43.590 --> 02:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
real numbers that they're showing in
 
02:22:45.030 --> 02:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
this data
 
02:22:47.990 --> 02:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
they're real numbers in the dod database
 
02:22:49.750 --> 02:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
and and
 
02:22:52.230 --> 02:22:52.240 align:start position:0%
just to add to that
 
02:22:55.510 --> 02:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
this database was put together uh it's
 
02:22:57.830 --> 02:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
been going for several years
 
02:23:01.910 --> 02:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
so you look at the 2020 numbers when
 
02:23:06.070 --> 02:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:08.550 --> 02:23:08.560 align:start position:0%
covid prior to covid then you can look
 
02:23:12.550 --> 02:23:12.560 align:start position:0%
at 2021 when we had covid here but no
 
02:23:14.790 --> 02:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
vaccines available and then you can look
 
02:23:14.800 --> 02:23:15.670 align:start position:0%
vaccines available and then you can look
at

02:23:15.670 --> 02:23:15.680 align:start position:0%
at
 
02:23:18.309 --> 02:23:18.319 align:start position:0%
the current data and and you see what
 
02:23:20.389 --> 02:23:20.399 align:start position:0%
you're suggesting is or what the
 
02:23:22.710 --> 02:23:22.720 align:start position:0%
database is saying is that
 
02:23:26.469 --> 02:23:26.479 align:start position:0%
clearly there has been a
 
02:23:29.270 --> 02:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
serious increase in the number of a
 
02:23:31.750 --> 02:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
broad spectrum of adverse events
 
02:23:34.870 --> 02:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
associated with the vaccine that's the
 
02:23:38.389 --> 02:23:38.399 align:start position:0%
only real change in
 
02:23:40.950 --> 02:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
what's going on with these young folks
 
02:23:43.429 --> 02:23:43.439 align:start position:0%
in the military it's a you know a young
 
02:23:45.990 --> 02:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
healthy population why are we seeing
 
02:23:49.349 --> 02:23:49.359 align:start position:0%
this tremendous change and and
 
02:23:52.550 --> 02:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:55.030 --> 02:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
the medical opinion is it's being driven
 
02:23:57.750 --> 02:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
by the vaccine
 
02:23:59.349 --> 02:23:59.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for your answer thank you very
 
02:24:00.550 --> 02:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
much for your oh representative
 
02:24:00.560 --> 02:24:02.870 align:start position:0%
much for your oh representative
burroughs

02:24:02.870 --> 02:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
burroughs
 
02:24:04.870 --> 02:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question can you
 
02:24:11.190 --> 02:24:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:13.910 --> 02:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
any studies done by credible agencies to
 
02:24:16.469 --> 02:24:16.479 align:start position:0%
support the the correlation between the
 
02:24:18.309 --> 02:24:18.319 align:start position:0%
vaccines and
 
02:24:22.150 --> 02:24:22.160 align:start position:0%
these incidents and and problems
 
02:24:25.429 --> 02:24:25.439 align:start position:0%
i i would suggest that the dod database
 
02:24:28.309 --> 02:24:28.319 align:start position:0%
is the best study that you have you have
 
02:24:29.349 --> 02:24:29.359 align:start position:0%
you have
 
02:24:29.359 --> 02:24:31.270 align:start position:0%
you have
young

02:24:31.270 --> 02:24:31.280 align:start position:0%
young
 
02:24:32.710 --> 02:24:32.720 align:start position:0%
healthy folks
 
02:24:34.389 --> 02:24:34.399 align:start position:0%
in the military
 
02:24:34.399 --> 02:24:35.910 align:start position:0%
in the military
and

02:24:35.910 --> 02:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:24:37.910 --> 02:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
they're they're being followed their
 
02:24:40.950 --> 02:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
entire military career and that that is
 
02:24:43.030 --> 02:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
the best data that we have on on this
 
02:24:44.150 --> 02:24:44.160 align:start position:0%
right now
 
02:24:45.190 --> 02:24:45.200 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
02:24:47.429 --> 02:24:47.439 align:start position:0%
for the question you mean car um
 
02:24:49.590 --> 02:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
so again in the database are there just
 
02:24:51.110 --> 02:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
numbers let's say
 
02:24:52.550 --> 02:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
what what does the database tell you
 
02:24:54.950 --> 02:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
does it tell you that there are 3 000
 
02:24:57.590 --> 02:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
women with fertility problems uh after
 
02:24:59.990 --> 02:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
having the vaccine
 
02:25:02.870 --> 02:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
it tell it gives you an incidence rates
 
02:25:04.870 --> 02:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
of various
 
02:25:06.950 --> 02:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh conditions
 
02:25:08.950 --> 02:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
they may not be called adverse events i
 
02:25:11.590 --> 02:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
mean you heard uh representative johnson
 
02:25:14.870 --> 02:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
say all right neurological problems okay
 
02:25:18.790 --> 02:25:18.800 align:start position:0%
that that that so what you see is
 
02:25:18.800 --> 02:25:19.670 align:start position:0%
that that that so what you see is
a

02:25:19.670 --> 02:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:25:23.270 --> 02:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
a increase in all these different areas
 
02:25:23.280 --> 02:25:24.389 align:start position:0%
a increase in all these different areas
of of

02:25:24.389 --> 02:25:24.399 align:start position:0%
of of
 
02:25:26.710 --> 02:25:26.720 align:start position:0%
medical problems
 
02:25:26.720 --> 02:25:27.429 align:start position:0%
medical problems
and

02:25:27.429 --> 02:25:27.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:25:30.630 --> 02:25:30.640 align:start position:0%
and you then you have to say what caused
 
02:25:33.190 --> 02:25:33.200 align:start position:0%
this what changed
 
02:25:35.110 --> 02:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
from last year
 
02:25:37.429 --> 02:25:37.439 align:start position:0%
and the year before what's what is
 
02:25:40.790 --> 02:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
different that we haven't had before now
 
02:25:42.389 --> 02:25:42.399 align:start position:0%
maybe there's another medical
 
02:25:44.790 --> 02:25:44.800 align:start position:0%
explanation but the only credible
 
02:25:47.830 --> 02:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
explanation that's been posited today is
 
02:25:50.309 --> 02:25:50.319 align:start position:0%
these are effects of the vaccine
 
02:25:54.230 --> 02:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up okay just real quick um
 
02:25:56.950 --> 02:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
you know i would would you believe that
 
02:25:58.309 --> 02:25:58.319 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
02:25:59.590 --> 02:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
more data
 
02:26:01.830 --> 02:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
to to find out where these numbers are
 
02:26:03.670 --> 02:26:03.680 align:start position:0%
coming from would be really important
 
02:26:06.630 --> 02:26:06.640 align:start position:0%
before we decide that there is a cause
 
02:26:08.469 --> 02:26:08.479 align:start position:0%
and an effect kind of thing with the
 
02:26:12.950 --> 02:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:17.510 --> 02:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:19.349 --> 02:26:19.359 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you very much for your
 
02:26:19.359 --> 02:26:21.510 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you very much for your
testimony

02:26:21.510 --> 02:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:26:23.510 --> 02:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
oh you take another question
 
02:26:23.520 --> 02:26:26.230 align:start position:0%
oh you take another question
representative

02:26:26.230 --> 02:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:28.710 --> 02:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
yeah uh i'm just looking on the ver's
 
02:26:28.720 --> 02:26:30.389 align:start position:0%
yeah uh i'm just looking on the ver's
website

02:26:30.389 --> 02:26:30.399 align:start position:0%
website
 
02:26:33.510 --> 02:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
site and um are you familiar with
 
02:26:35.990 --> 02:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
this paragraph which
 
02:26:38.070 --> 02:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
begins with but with newfound attention
 
02:26:40.469 --> 02:26:40.479 align:start position:0%
on theirs this crucial public health
 
02:26:43.429 --> 02:26:43.439 align:start position:0%
system which anyone can access is ripe
 
02:26:44.790 --> 02:26:44.800 align:start position:0%
for abuse
 
02:26:47.349 --> 02:26:47.359 align:start position:0%
misuse and plain misunderstanding have
 
02:26:49.670 --> 02:26:49.680 align:start position:0%
you read that on that website
 
02:26:51.510 --> 02:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
yes that's why i made the comment that
 
02:26:53.750 --> 02:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
the the the distinction between the
 
02:26:56.790 --> 02:26:56.800 align:start position:0%
theirs database and the dod database is
 
02:26:59.750 --> 02:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
the vera's database
 
02:27:02.070 --> 02:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
you do not have to be a physician to
 
02:27:05.429 --> 02:27:05.439 align:start position:0%
have filed the adverse event claim
 
02:27:07.990 --> 02:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
and hence that that causes that
 
02:27:10.870 --> 02:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
statement to be part of the public
 
02:27:13.590 --> 02:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
notice with respect to that database
 
02:27:15.830 --> 02:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
whereas the dod database that
 
02:27:18.150 --> 02:27:18.160 align:start position:0%
representative johnson uh
 
02:27:18.160 --> 02:27:19.190 align:start position:0%
representative johnson uh
as

02:27:19.190 --> 02:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
as
 
02:27:22.870 --> 02:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
has brought to the uh our attention is
 
02:27:22.880 --> 02:27:25.030 align:start position:0%
has brought to the uh our attention is
only

02:27:25.030 --> 02:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
only
 
02:27:26.389 --> 02:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
managed by
 
02:27:29.349 --> 02:27:29.359 align:start position:0%
physicians in the military and therefore
 
02:27:33.270 --> 02:27:33.280 align:start position:0%
does not contain that same disclaimer
 
02:27:35.110 --> 02:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
yeah so actually uh representative
 
02:27:37.270 --> 02:27:37.280 align:start position:0%
creation just reminded that he sent out
 
02:27:40.389 --> 02:27:40.399 align:start position:0%
an email to all of us uh which had a
 
02:27:42.950 --> 02:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
video clip and he told us to watch
 
02:27:45.110 --> 02:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
part of it that four hour the four hour
 
02:27:47.750 --> 02:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
mark which i did do which it directly
 
02:27:49.190 --> 02:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
addresses this
 
02:27:51.190 --> 02:27:51.200 align:start position:0%
uh information from the department of
 
02:27:51.200 --> 02:27:52.230 align:start position:0%
uh information from the department of
defense

02:27:52.230 --> 02:27:52.240 align:start position:0%
defense
 
02:27:54.710 --> 02:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
so so you can learn more by watching
 
02:27:56.469 --> 02:27:56.479 align:start position:0%
that video
 
02:27:57.349 --> 02:27:57.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:27:59.190 --> 02:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
02:28:01.429 --> 02:28:01.439 align:start position:0%
representative terry and is it is it not
 
02:28:03.030 --> 02:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
also true that
 
02:28:05.110 --> 02:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
uh the vares database
 
02:28:07.429 --> 02:28:07.439 align:start position:0%
uh would capture
 
02:28:09.910 --> 02:28:09.920 align:start position:0%
potentially uh reports from the entire
 
02:28:12.630 --> 02:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
population of the united states whereas
 
02:28:14.309 --> 02:28:14.319 align:start position:0%
the dod
 
02:28:16.550 --> 02:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
universe is much smaller
 
02:28:18.469 --> 02:28:18.479 align:start position:0%
therefore a figure
 
02:28:22.830 --> 02:28:22.840 align:start position:0%
of 82 000 and change in 2020 to
 
02:28:24.950 --> 02:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
836 thousand
 
02:28:28.389 --> 02:28:28.399 align:start position:0%
or 863 000 in 2021
 
02:28:31.670 --> 02:28:31.680 align:start position:0%
is an enormous number in that smaller
 
02:28:34.630 --> 02:28:34.640 align:start position:0%
universe am i correct in that
 
02:28:38.790 --> 02:28:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:40.550 --> 02:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you very much for your
 
02:28:40.560 --> 02:28:42.469 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you very much for your
testimony

02:28:42.469 --> 02:28:42.479 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:28:45.349 --> 02:28:45.359 align:start position:0%
uh represent oh no it's good michelle
 
02:28:46.870 --> 02:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
eaton from the insurance department
 
02:28:55.030 --> 02:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:57.110 --> 02:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
hello again i'm michelle heaton the
 
02:28:59.349 --> 02:28:59.359 align:start position:0%
health law and policy legal counsel from
 
02:29:01.830 --> 02:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
the insurance department um as i said
 
02:29:03.510 --> 02:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
before we're we don't take a position on
 
02:29:04.469 --> 02:29:04.479 align:start position:0%
this but we're really here for
 
02:29:06.630 --> 02:29:06.640 align:start position:0%
informational purposes and when we first
 
02:29:07.670 --> 02:29:07.680 align:start position:0%
looked at the bill we weren't really
 
02:29:08.950 --> 02:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
sure what it was trying to accomplish
 
02:29:10.469 --> 02:29:10.479 align:start position:0%
but now i understand it's because of the
 
02:29:13.110 --> 02:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
way legislative services put it in um
 
02:29:15.429 --> 02:29:15.439 align:start position:0%
which makes a little bit more sense um
 
02:29:17.110 --> 02:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
but there are a couple things in here
 
02:29:19.349 --> 02:29:19.359 align:start position:0%
that i just wanted to clarify um
 
02:29:22.309 --> 02:29:22.319 align:start position:0%
experimental investigational drugs are
 
02:29:24.150 --> 02:29:24.160 align:start position:0%
it's a different process and different
 
02:29:25.990 --> 02:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
classification than emergency use drugs
 
02:29:28.070 --> 02:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
so i just want to point that out also i
 
02:29:30.389 --> 02:29:30.399 align:start position:0%
don't think that
 
02:29:30.399 --> 02:29:31.750 align:start position:0%
don't think that
this

02:29:31.750 --> 02:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:29:34.790 --> 02:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
this amendment is even necessary
 
02:29:37.510 --> 02:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
under essential health benefits insurers
 
02:29:39.110 --> 02:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
would have to cover any medically
 
02:29:41.190 --> 02:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
necessary treatment whether that came
 
02:29:43.429 --> 02:29:43.439 align:start position:0%
from um receiving an experimental
 
02:29:47.670 --> 02:29:47.680 align:start position:0%
vaccine or treatment or not so um
 
02:29:50.710 --> 02:29:50.720 align:start position:0%
i i don't think that this is necessary
 
02:29:52.150 --> 02:29:52.160 align:start position:0%
but um
 
02:29:53.910 --> 02:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
if if we did want to go ahead with it i
 
02:29:55.830 --> 02:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
would just
 
02:29:57.590 --> 02:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
suggest cleaning up the language more so
 
02:29:59.830 --> 02:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
it's a bit clearer as to what we're
 
02:30:01.590 --> 02:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish so there's knowing
 
02:30:03.190 --> 02:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
a big beauty in the future but i'm happy
 
02:30:04.469 --> 02:30:04.479 align:start position:0%
to take any questions
 
02:30:06.870 --> 02:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
okay uh did i see your hand yes
 
02:30:09.110 --> 02:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
representative johnson
 
02:30:11.270 --> 02:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
hi thank you for taking my question
 
02:30:13.990 --> 02:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
so i have a kind of a scenario and asked
 
02:30:16.550 --> 02:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
and to find out if this is true
 
02:30:19.429 --> 02:30:19.439 align:start position:0%
that i had say someone purchase a has a
 
02:30:22.070 --> 02:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
health insurance policy they have taken
 
02:30:24.469 --> 02:30:24.479 align:start position:0%
this experimental shot
 
02:30:25.429 --> 02:30:25.439 align:start position:0%
and they
 
02:30:27.750 --> 02:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
die from it
 
02:30:29.670 --> 02:30:29.680 align:start position:0%
is their insurance
 
02:30:29.680 --> 02:30:31.270 align:start position:0%
is their insurance
policy

02:30:31.270 --> 02:30:31.280 align:start position:0%
policy
 
02:30:33.349 --> 02:30:33.359 align:start position:0%
liable to is still
 
02:30:34.790 --> 02:30:34.800 align:start position:0%
eligible to have they have to pay for
 
02:30:37.190 --> 02:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
that policy because i've been told there
 
02:30:39.190 --> 02:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
are people who have put the claims in
 
02:30:40.710 --> 02:30:40.720 align:start position:0%
for their death
 
02:30:42.790 --> 02:30:42.800 align:start position:0%
you know they're survivors
 
02:30:45.110 --> 02:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
and they were saying no because
 
02:30:48.230 --> 02:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
the death was contributed to the shot
 
02:30:49.830 --> 02:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
and now they will not cover it because
 
02:30:53.270 --> 02:30:53.280 align:start position:0%
the shot is still experimental
 
02:30:53.280 --> 02:30:55.030 align:start position:0%
the shot is still experimental
well

02:30:55.030 --> 02:30:55.040 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:30:56.790 --> 02:30:56.800 align:start position:0%
i'm not exactly sure what you're asking
 
02:30:59.190 --> 02:30:59.200 align:start position:0%
because major medical coverage covers
 
02:31:01.270 --> 02:31:01.280 align:start position:0%
your medical expenses and if someone
 
02:31:02.710 --> 02:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
were to die you wouldn't get a death
 
02:31:04.150 --> 02:31:04.160 align:start position:0%
benefit that from that that would be
 
02:31:06.150 --> 02:31:06.160 align:start position:0%
like life insurance
 
02:31:07.429 --> 02:31:07.439 align:start position:0%
that's what i'm talking about the life
 
02:31:08.630 --> 02:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
insurance i would have to say to you
 
02:31:10.389 --> 02:31:10.399 align:start position:0%
that unfortunately this bill in the
 
02:31:10.399 --> 02:31:11.510 align:start position:0%
that unfortunately this bill in the
amendment

02:31:11.510 --> 02:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:31:13.830 --> 02:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
the bill as we've seen is addressing
 
02:31:15.429 --> 02:31:15.439 align:start position:0%
health insurance
 
02:31:17.670 --> 02:31:17.680 align:start position:0%
a life insurance is a different section
 
02:31:20.150 --> 02:31:20.160 align:start position:0%
of the statute so if that were true then
 
02:31:21.429 --> 02:31:21.439 align:start position:0%
we would have to look at a different
 
02:31:23.670 --> 02:31:23.680 align:start position:0%
section of the statute to ensure that
 
02:31:23.680 --> 02:31:24.550 align:start position:0%
section of the statute to ensure that
that

02:31:24.550 --> 02:31:24.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:31:28.630 --> 02:31:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:30.950 --> 02:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:31:33.030 --> 02:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
i have one more caller left and it's
 
02:31:35.510 --> 02:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
paula minihan and she did not make it
 
02:31:38.710 --> 02:31:38.720 align:start position:0%
back to the committee room uh and she is
 
02:31:40.070 --> 02:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
representing new hampshire hospital
 
02:31:42.550 --> 02:31:42.560 align:start position:0%
association in opposition to the bill
 
02:31:44.550 --> 02:31:44.560 align:start position:0%
and she will let you know get uh send
 
02:31:46.389 --> 02:31:46.399 align:start position:0%
her written testimony
 
02:31:46.399 --> 02:31:47.830 align:start position:0%
her written testimony
and

02:31:47.830 --> 02:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:31:50.550 --> 02:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
did i just get another card
 
02:31:53.830 --> 02:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:56.550 --> 02:31:56.560 align:start position:0%
okay uh and and you signed it you know
 
02:31:58.710 --> 02:31:58.720 align:start position:0%
you think
 
02:31:58.720 --> 02:31:59.910 align:start position:0%
you think
okay

02:31:59.910 --> 02:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:32:03.190 --> 02:32:03.200 align:start position:0%
why don't you tell us your name because
 
02:32:05.110 --> 02:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
it looks like stroganoff or something to
 
02:32:05.120 --> 02:32:12.870 align:start position:0%
it looks like stroganoff or something to
me

02:32:12.870 --> 02:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:14.950 --> 02:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
you have to turn push the little button
 
02:32:17.270 --> 02:32:17.280 align:start position:0%
so the red light goes on and talk closer
 
02:32:18.710 --> 02:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman ladies and
 
02:32:21.270 --> 02:32:21.280 align:start position:0%
gentlemen of the committee um
 
02:32:23.190 --> 02:32:23.200 align:start position:0%
my name is mark stagnone i'm a
 
02:32:25.429 --> 02:32:25.439 align:start position:0%
chiropractor from londonderry i've been
 
02:32:28.389 --> 02:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
in practice there for 35 years i'm just
 
02:32:30.950 --> 02:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
going to take two minutes
 
02:32:34.070 --> 02:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
because i actually do have before me a
 
02:32:35.830 --> 02:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
study that you may find interesting in
 
02:32:38.469 --> 02:32:38.479 align:start position:0%
this topic i'm not from totally familiar
 
02:32:39.990 --> 02:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
with the language in this bill but i
 
02:32:43.190 --> 02:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
will i'll simply share with you a study
 
02:32:45.830 --> 02:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
from the american heart association it
 
02:32:49.429 --> 02:32:49.439 align:start position:0%
is abstract number one zero seven one
 
02:32:49.439 --> 02:32:50.469 align:start position:0%
is abstract number one zero seven one
two

02:32:50.469 --> 02:32:50.479 align:start position:0%
two
 
02:32:52.630 --> 02:32:52.640 align:start position:0%
and it came out in november
 
02:32:54.230 --> 02:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
it is entitled
 
02:32:57.670 --> 02:32:57.680 align:start position:0%
mrna coveted vaccines dramatically
 
02:32:57.680 --> 02:32:58.830 align:start position:0%
mrna coveted vaccines dramatically
increase

02:32:58.830 --> 02:32:58.840 align:start position:0%
increase
 
02:33:02.150 --> 02:33:02.160 align:start position:0%

02:33:06.150 --> 02:33:06.160 align:start position:0%

acs stands for acute coronary syndrome
 
02:33:17.750 --> 02:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
and i will just read you the last two
 
02:33:20.389 --> 02:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
lines of this report
 
02:33:23.190 --> 02:33:23.200 align:start position:0%
we conclude that the mrna facts
 
02:33:25.510 --> 02:33:25.520 align:start position:0%
dramatically increase inflammation on
 
02:33:28.550 --> 02:33:28.560 align:start position:0%
the endothelium and t cell infiltration
 
02:33:31.270 --> 02:33:31.280 align:start position:0%
of cardiac muscle and may account for
 
02:33:34.030 --> 02:33:34.040 align:start position:0%
the observations of increased thrombosis
 
02:33:37.190 --> 02:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
cardiomyopathy and other events
 
02:33:39.349 --> 02:33:39.359 align:start position:0%
following vaccination
 
02:33:42.550 --> 02:33:42.560 align:start position:0%
now one side note to this study
 
02:33:44.469 --> 02:33:44.479 align:start position:0%
three weeks later i went to share it
 
02:33:46.710 --> 02:33:46.720 align:start position:0%
with my colleague representative
 
02:33:46.720 --> 02:33:47.750 align:start position:0%
with my colleague representative
lundgren

02:33:47.750 --> 02:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
lundgren
 
02:33:50.790 --> 02:33:50.800 align:start position:0%
and the title was changed
 
02:33:54.710 --> 02:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
and the paragraph i just read to you was
 
02:33:57.830 --> 02:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
changed and modified and all of the
 
02:34:01.110 --> 02:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
language was subdued the results were
 
02:34:02.550 --> 02:34:02.560 align:start position:0%
the same
 
02:34:05.190 --> 02:34:05.200 align:start position:0%
and the risk factor for an acute
 
02:34:10.550 --> 02:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
coronary syndrome went from 11 to 25
 
02:34:12.870 --> 02:34:12.880 align:start position:0%
in a test population that they had
 
02:34:17.270 --> 02:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
followed for eight years 506
 
02:34:20.389 --> 02:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
patients that were in this ongoing study
 
02:34:22.469 --> 02:34:22.479 align:start position:0%
where they met with them every three to
 
02:34:24.870 --> 02:34:24.880 align:start position:0%
six months they did all the lab work to
 
02:34:27.349 --> 02:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
measure their their risk of a cardiac
 
02:34:27.359 --> 02:34:28.389 align:start position:0%
measure their their risk of a cardiac
event

02:34:28.389 --> 02:34:28.399 align:start position:0%
event
 
02:34:30.230 --> 02:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
and then when they started getting their
 
02:34:33.030 --> 02:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
shots they continued the program and
 
02:34:35.750 --> 02:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
these were the observations they made
 
02:34:39.429 --> 02:34:39.439 align:start position:0%
as the individuals came in post
 
02:34:39.439 --> 02:34:41.510 align:start position:0%
as the individuals came in post
vaccination

02:34:41.510 --> 02:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
vaccination
 
02:34:43.910 --> 02:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
obviously there's more study on their
 
02:34:45.270 --> 02:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
behalf to do
 
02:34:47.030 --> 02:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
but given what i was hearing i thought
 
02:34:49.030 --> 02:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
you might be interested in this
 
02:34:51.910 --> 02:34:51.920 align:start position:0%
conversation so not that i'm a physician
 
02:34:53.590 --> 02:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
so i don't know too much about that but
 
02:34:55.910 --> 02:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
cardiac's one word to me but i do know
 
02:34:57.510 --> 02:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
isn't this the reason why the johnson

johnson was suspended for a period of
 
02:34:59.680 --> 02:35:02.309 align:start position:0%
johnson was suspended for a period of
time

02:35:02.309 --> 02:35:02.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:04.950 --> 02:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
well mr chairman i'm i i'm not certain
 
02:35:06.950 --> 02:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
as to the specifics i think that's
 
02:35:08.950 --> 02:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
possible the interesting thing here was
 
02:35:10.830 --> 02:35:10.840 align:start position:0%
it's that it's the
 
02:35:14.309 --> 02:35:14.319 align:start position:0%
mrna vaccine i think that the j j was a
 
02:35:14.319 --> 02:35:15.510 align:start position:0%
mrna vaccine i think that the j j was a
different

02:35:15.510 --> 02:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:35:19.030 --> 02:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
vehicle by which that that one worked
 
02:35:19.040 --> 02:35:19.990 align:start position:0%
vehicle by which that that one worked
okay

02:35:19.990 --> 02:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:35:21.750 --> 02:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett has a question
 
02:35:24.070 --> 02:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
thanks very much mr chair um can you
 
02:35:25.670 --> 02:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
tell me what that has to do with this
 
02:35:27.429 --> 02:35:27.439 align:start position:0%
bill that we're looking at
 
02:35:30.230 --> 02:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
well uh i'm i'm not terribly familiar
 
02:35:32.230 --> 02:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
with the bill but i heard the the
 
02:35:33.910 --> 02:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
gentleman that was up here questioned
 
02:35:35.750 --> 02:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
earlier that there was the question
 
02:35:35.760 --> 02:35:36.630 align:start position:0%
earlier that there was the question
about

02:35:36.630 --> 02:35:36.640 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:35:38.950 --> 02:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
any solid studies or something to that
 
02:35:41.910 --> 02:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
effect and i i just thought this study
 
02:35:46.950 --> 02:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
would be one that might fit into
 
02:35:49.270 --> 02:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
the topic that you're discussing
 
02:35:49.280 --> 02:35:51.030 align:start position:0%
the topic that you're discussing
and

02:35:51.030 --> 02:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:35:53.349 --> 02:35:53.359 align:start position:0%
and i appreciate the the chairman's
 
02:35:55.670 --> 02:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
ability to let me come up here and share
 
02:35:57.590 --> 02:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
it well it's very fortuitous that you
 
02:35:59.830 --> 02:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
did because now paula minnihan is here
 
02:36:02.389 --> 02:36:02.399 align:start position:0%
so she can't testify
 
02:36:03.590 --> 02:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
any more ques
 
02:36:06.830 --> 02:36:06.840 align:start position:0%
he's okay liverpool
 
02:36:10.309 --> 02:36:10.319 align:start position:0%
burroughs so that study was there any
 
02:36:12.230 --> 02:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
data to show a correlation between the
 
02:36:14.389 --> 02:36:14.399 align:start position:0%
participants and pre-existing heart
 
02:36:14.399 --> 02:36:16.389 align:start position:0%
participants and pre-existing heart
problems

02:36:16.389 --> 02:36:16.399 align:start position:0%
problems
 
02:36:18.630 --> 02:36:18.640 align:start position:0%
well from what i read in the experiment
 
02:36:21.349 --> 02:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
this is why they followed these patients
 
02:36:23.110 --> 02:36:23.120 align:start position:0%
for the length of time that they did is
 
02:36:25.670 --> 02:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
that they obviously were
 
02:36:27.750 --> 02:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
at some level of risk that they were
 
02:36:30.870 --> 02:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
trying to assess and i can't tell you if
 
02:36:34.630 --> 02:36:34.640 align:start position:0%
11 to 25 percent is dramatic
 
02:36:36.630 --> 02:36:36.640 align:start position:0%
it's more than double we can do that
 
02:36:38.710 --> 02:36:38.720 align:start position:0%
math pretty simply
 
02:36:40.630 --> 02:36:40.640 align:start position:0%
i don't know how that fits into the word
 
02:36:42.550 --> 02:36:42.560 align:start position:0%
of cardiology it's certainly not my
 
02:36:42.560 --> 02:36:44.150 align:start position:0%
of cardiology it's certainly not my
specialty

02:36:44.150 --> 02:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
specialty
 
02:36:46.070 --> 02:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
i did feel that it was interesting that
 
02:36:48.870 --> 02:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
they felt it necessary to issue a
 
02:36:48.880 --> 02:36:52.790 align:start position:0%
they felt it necessary to issue a
warning

02:36:52.790 --> 02:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:54.630 --> 02:36:54.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:36:56.870 --> 02:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you
 
02:36:59.190 --> 02:36:59.200 align:start position:0%
and now paula
 
02:37:11.030 --> 02:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:28.309 --> 02:37:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:32.150 --> 02:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
and it is still morning good morning
 
02:37:34.389 --> 02:37:34.399 align:start position:0%
mr chairman sorry it was delayed
 
02:37:34.399 --> 02:37:35.990 align:start position:0%
mr chairman sorry it was delayed
downstairs

02:37:35.990 --> 02:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
downstairs
 
02:37:38.070 --> 02:37:38.080 align:start position:0%
my name is paula minihan senior vice
 
02:37:39.990 --> 02:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
president state government relations
 
02:37:41.030 --> 02:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
with the new hampshire hospital
 
02:37:42.389 --> 02:37:42.399 align:start position:0%
association representing all our
 
02:37:45.590 --> 02:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
hospitals we are opposed to house bill
 
02:37:47.990 --> 02:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
1162 i did not hear
 
02:37:50.550 --> 02:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
the sponsor introduce the bill so and i
 
02:37:52.790 --> 02:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
was honestly a little confused in
 
02:37:54.309 --> 02:37:54.319 align:start position:0%
reading it um
 
02:37:56.550 --> 02:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
so so the consensus we know what she's
 
02:37:59.510 --> 02:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
intended to do which is simply that
 
02:38:02.150 --> 02:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
if it was one of these emergency
 
02:38:02.160 --> 02:38:03.750 align:start position:0%
if it was one of these emergency
vaccines

02:38:03.750 --> 02:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
vaccines
 
02:38:05.830 --> 02:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
that the insurance companies would cover
 
02:38:05.840 --> 02:38:06.469 align:start position:0%
that the insurance companies would cover
it

02:38:06.469 --> 02:38:06.479 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:38:08.710 --> 02:38:08.720 align:start position:0%
if it was under emergency use
 
02:38:11.670 --> 02:38:11.680 align:start position:0%
authorization if it is if it is that
 
02:38:13.510 --> 02:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
situation then the insurance companies
 
02:38:14.790 --> 02:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
must cover it
 
02:38:16.630 --> 02:38:16.640 align:start position:0%
okay that was the intent
 
02:38:16.640 --> 02:38:17.910 align:start position:0%
okay that was the intent
okay

02:38:17.910 --> 02:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:38:17.920 --> 02:38:19.590 align:start position:0%
okay
um

02:38:19.590 --> 02:38:19.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:21.110 --> 02:38:21.120 align:start position:0%
i don't know that this bill does that
 
02:38:23.429 --> 02:38:23.439 align:start position:0%
though well we can we'll the committee
 
02:38:25.510 --> 02:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
will have that responsibility just to
 
02:38:26.790 --> 02:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
unwind that
 
02:38:28.469 --> 02:38:28.479 align:start position:0%
situation okay
 
02:38:31.349 --> 02:38:31.359 align:start position:0%
so again um we were confused
 
02:38:32.710 --> 02:38:32.720 align:start position:0%
in reading it
 
02:38:34.870 --> 02:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
because it implied that the bill would
 
02:38:37.590 --> 02:38:37.600 align:start position:0%
prohibit insurers from excluding
 
02:38:39.750 --> 02:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
coverage for any vaccines devices or
 
02:38:41.990 --> 02:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
medication that has been authorized for
 
02:38:43.670 --> 02:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
emergency use by the
 
02:38:43.680 --> 02:38:44.790 align:start position:0%
emergency use by the
u.s

02:38:44.790 --> 02:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
u.s
 
02:38:47.110 --> 02:38:47.120 align:start position:0%
food and drug administration however
 
02:38:48.550 --> 02:38:48.560 align:start position:0%
if you read the statute that's being
 
02:38:50.550 --> 02:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
amended in its entirety this bill would
 
02:38:52.309 --> 02:38:52.319 align:start position:0%
in fact allow for the insurer to not
 
02:38:52.319 --> 02:38:53.349 align:start position:0%
in fact allow for the insurer to not
cover

02:38:53.349 --> 02:38:53.359 align:start position:0%
cover
 
02:38:55.590 --> 02:38:55.600 align:start position:0%
those vaccines um not approved by the
 
02:38:57.590 --> 02:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
fda and again i think the wording is a
 
02:38:57.600 --> 02:38:59.110 align:start position:0%
fda and again i think the wording is a
little

02:38:59.110 --> 02:38:59.120 align:start position:0%
little
 
02:39:00.950 --> 02:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
challenging because
 
02:39:03.750 --> 02:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
the fda these if we're talking about
 
02:39:05.349 --> 02:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
covet vaccines and they're under
 
02:39:07.670 --> 02:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
emergency use authorization not
 
02:39:09.270 --> 02:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
under um they're not considered
 
02:39:09.280 --> 02:39:11.110 align:start position:0%
under um they're not considered
experimental

02:39:11.110 --> 02:39:11.120 align:start position:0%
experimental
 
02:39:13.590 --> 02:39:13.600 align:start position:0%
so we do not
 
02:39:13.600 --> 02:39:14.389 align:start position:0%
so we do not
want

02:39:14.389 --> 02:39:14.399 align:start position:0%
want
 
02:39:16.630 --> 02:39:16.640 align:start position:0%
or believe that the insurers should and
 
02:39:19.590 --> 02:39:19.600 align:start position:0%
i don't think they are so i question the
 
02:39:21.349 --> 02:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
need of this bill
 
02:39:23.030 --> 02:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
that we do not want them to deny
 
02:39:25.190 --> 02:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
vaccinations that have been approved
 
02:39:28.309 --> 02:39:28.319 align:start position:0%
under emergency use authorization
 
02:39:30.150 --> 02:39:30.160 align:start position:0%
so that's why we do not support any
 
02:39:31.990 --> 02:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
limitations of insurance coverage and
 
02:39:34.870 --> 02:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
again i don't believe in sure i i
 
02:39:37.110 --> 02:39:37.120 align:start position:0%
believe insurance companies are covering
 
02:39:39.110 --> 02:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
them so i am not worried about that i
 
02:39:40.150 --> 02:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
just don't
 
02:39:42.070 --> 02:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
understand what we need why we would
 
02:39:44.150 --> 02:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
need this bill so i think um that was
 
02:39:46.950 --> 02:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
our concern so thank you so uh again the
 
02:39:49.030 --> 02:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
question i would request for view from
 
02:39:51.030 --> 02:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
your associate members if you could send
 
02:39:53.030 --> 02:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
out a bulletin and see if they have any
 
02:39:54.870 --> 02:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
evidence that an insurance company did
 
02:39:56.070 --> 02:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
not cover
 
02:39:57.830 --> 02:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
a symptom
 
02:40:02.790 --> 02:40:02.800 align:start position:0%
a bad outcome from having to take the
 
02:40:05.830 --> 02:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
quote-unquote experimental vaccine
 
02:40:08.230 --> 02:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
okay so the question is i should check
 
02:40:10.630 --> 02:40:10.640 align:start position:0%
any insurance company refused any if
 
02:40:13.429 --> 02:40:13.439 align:start position:0%
there was a symptom related to a covet
 
02:40:15.349 --> 02:40:15.359 align:start position:0%
vaccine vaccination i'm going to start
 
02:40:17.030 --> 02:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
on the assumption that you of course you
 
02:40:18.950 --> 02:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
covered it and took care of them yes
 
02:40:21.030 --> 02:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
that was that patient was there that's
 
02:40:22.870 --> 02:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
right so i just want to know whether
 
02:40:24.790 --> 02:40:24.800 align:start position:0%
there was any any any
 
02:40:26.389 --> 02:40:26.399 align:start position:0%
issue with insurance had any problems
 
02:40:27.670 --> 02:40:27.680 align:start position:0%
did you guys have anything i will
 
02:40:29.750 --> 02:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
research that right and get back to you
 
02:40:31.510 --> 02:40:31.520 align:start position:0%

1245 and hear from the prime sponsor
 
02:41:59.110 --> 02:41:59.120 align:start position:0%
representative london

02:42:14.230 --> 02:42:14.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and uh fine committee
 
02:42:17.269 --> 02:42:17.279 align:start position:0%
for allowing us to talk on house bill
 
02:42:19.830 --> 02:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
1245. i'll be very brief because i know
 
02:42:21.910 --> 02:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
what it's like to be sitting there for
 
02:42:23.590 --> 02:42:23.600 align:start position:0%
hours on end
 
02:42:23.600 --> 02:42:24.389 align:start position:0%
hours on end
um

02:42:24.389 --> 02:42:24.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:42:27.429 --> 02:42:27.439 align:start position:0%
basically this bill uh has to do with
 
02:42:29.349 --> 02:42:29.359 align:start position:0%
reduction of co-pays
 
02:42:31.269 --> 02:42:31.279 align:start position:0%
for chiropractors
 
02:42:32.790 --> 02:42:32.800 align:start position:0%
and also
 
02:42:35.269 --> 02:42:35.279 align:start position:0%
reducing our
 
02:42:37.830 --> 02:42:37.840 align:start position:0%
from specialists to a primary care
 
02:42:37.840 --> 02:42:40.710 align:start position:0%
from specialists to a primary care
provider

02:42:40.710 --> 02:42:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:42.230 --> 02:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
the copays
 
02:42:44.710 --> 02:42:44.720 align:start position:0%
reduction make it much more accessible
 
02:42:47.590 --> 02:42:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:51.590 --> 02:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
yeah just make it closer i'm sorry
 
02:42:53.510 --> 02:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
believe it or not we're actually
 
02:42:55.510 --> 02:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
translating your words
 
02:42:57.429 --> 02:42:57.439 align:start position:0%
oh so
 
02:42:58.710 --> 02:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
well i should speak in a foreign
 
02:42:58.720 --> 02:42:59.590 align:start position:0%
well i should speak in a foreign
language

02:42:59.590 --> 02:42:59.600 align:start position:0%
language
 
02:43:05.590 --> 02:43:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:05.600 --> 02:43:07.269 align:start position:0%
 
anyway

02:43:07.269 --> 02:43:07.279 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
02:43:09.590 --> 02:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
what we find is that p patients come in
 
02:43:13.190 --> 02:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
a primary for for pain relief
 
02:43:13.200 --> 02:43:14.389 align:start position:0%
a primary for for pain relief
and

02:43:14.389 --> 02:43:14.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:43:17.030 --> 02:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
we find that by our treatments we're
 
02:43:18.469 --> 02:43:18.479 align:start position:0%
reducing costs
 
02:43:20.870 --> 02:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
with insurance companies
 
02:43:23.110 --> 02:43:23.120 align:start position:0%
due to avoiding any
 
02:43:23.120 --> 02:43:24.469 align:start position:0%
due to avoiding any
opioids

02:43:24.469 --> 02:43:24.479 align:start position:0%
opioids
 
02:43:27.750 --> 02:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh this bill will be no increase to
 
02:43:29.510 --> 02:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
insurance costs
 
02:43:29.520 --> 02:43:30.309 align:start position:0%
insurance costs
and

02:43:30.309 --> 02:43:30.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:43:32.870 --> 02:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
i just have a couple other things uh
 
02:43:36.630 --> 02:43:36.640 align:start position:0%
90 percent of
 
02:43:38.630 --> 02:43:38.640 align:start position:0%
the literature that i've seen showed
 
02:43:40.950 --> 02:43:40.960 align:start position:0%
cost savings which improved patient
 
02:43:43.990 --> 02:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
satisfaction lower opioid use among
 
02:43:45.910 --> 02:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
patients with first-line access to
 
02:43:45.920 --> 02:43:47.030 align:start position:0%
patients with first-line access to
compute

02:43:47.030 --> 02:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
compute
 
02:43:47.040 --> 02:43:48.550 align:start position:0%
compute
chiropractors

02:43:48.550 --> 02:43:48.560 align:start position:0%
chiropractors
 
02:43:50.469 --> 02:43:50.479 align:start position:0%
chiropractors are not specialists and
 
02:43:52.309 --> 02:43:52.319 align:start position:0%
we'd like to be taken out of that
 
02:43:55.030 --> 02:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
category to make it
 
02:43:58.309 --> 02:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
allowable for us to reduce our co-pays
 
02:44:03.190 --> 02:44:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:07.269 --> 02:44:07.279 align:start position:0%
uh pcp uh runs from say 10 10 to 20 it
 
02:44:09.590 --> 02:44:09.600 align:start position:0%
makes it the access to our care that
 
02:44:12.230 --> 02:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
much easier um i'll be happy to try to
 
02:44:14.389 --> 02:44:14.399 align:start position:0%
answer any questions i know i have three
 
02:44:15.990 --> 02:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
other people in back of me that want to
 
02:44:17.510 --> 02:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
speak so i just don't want to spend any
 
02:44:19.110 --> 02:44:19.120 align:start position:0%
more time
 
02:44:20.389 --> 02:44:20.399 align:start position:0%
uh representative bartlett has a
 
02:44:22.790 --> 02:44:22.800 align:start position:0%

representative burroughs
 
02:44:45.190 --> 02:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
yeah and this may be a question for
 
02:44:46.710 --> 02:44:46.720 align:start position:0%
chairman hunt and i generally don't i
 
02:44:48.469 --> 02:44:48.479 align:start position:0%
really don't know the answer to this has
 
02:44:50.950 --> 02:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
the legislature ever been responsible
 
02:44:54.070 --> 02:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
for setting co-payment rates
 
02:44:54.080 --> 02:44:55.110 align:start position:0%
for setting co-payment rates
uh

02:44:55.110 --> 02:44:55.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:44:57.910 --> 02:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
well yeah yeah sure yes
 
02:44:59.990 --> 02:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
co-pays and deductibles
 
02:45:01.510 --> 02:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
i would say the only the only
 
02:45:05.349 --> 02:45:05.359 align:start position:0%
chiropractor bill i remember in the past
 
02:45:09.590 --> 02:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
was um that that if the company was to
 
02:45:11.990 --> 02:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
cover it they'd had to give you 12
 
02:45:15.429 --> 02:45:15.439 align:start position:0%
visits a year and and
 
02:45:17.190 --> 02:45:17.200 align:start position:0%
i and and much of that was a health
 
02:45:19.349 --> 02:45:19.359 align:start position:0%
insurance mandate that that
 
02:45:22.070 --> 02:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
the chair generally just never supports
 
02:45:22.080 --> 02:45:23.510 align:start position:0%
the chair generally just never supports
mandates

02:45:23.510 --> 02:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
mandates
 
02:45:26.150 --> 02:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
uh she voted against that one and sure
 
02:45:28.790 --> 02:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
enough there was in carriers
 
02:45:31.190 --> 02:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
that stopped covering chiropractic
 
02:45:31.200 --> 02:45:33.030 align:start position:0%
that stopped covering chiropractic
altogether

02:45:33.030 --> 02:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
altogether
 
02:45:35.190 --> 02:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
because we passed that
 
02:45:38.630 --> 02:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
legislation so that is a sign that so
 
02:45:40.230 --> 02:45:40.240 align:start position:0%
there is a potential that if we were to
 
02:45:42.710 --> 02:45:42.720 align:start position:0%
pass this there there might be less
 
02:45:44.230 --> 02:45:44.240 align:start position:0%
insurance companies offering
 
02:45:46.150 --> 02:45:46.160 align:start position:0%
chiropractic coverage
 
02:45:48.389 --> 02:45:48.399 align:start position:0%
so representative bartlett well mr chair
 
02:45:50.550 --> 02:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
since you opened the door
 
02:45:52.710 --> 02:45:52.720 align:start position:0%
may i ask if you have any carriers that
 
02:45:53.990 --> 02:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
will not
 
02:45:57.269 --> 02:45:57.279 align:start position:0%
cover chiropractic i haven't had any
 
02:45:59.750 --> 02:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you i haven't had any but
 
02:46:02.469 --> 02:46:02.479 align:start position:0%
i will say that
 
02:46:02.479 --> 02:46:03.750 align:start position:0%
i will say that
teachers

02:46:03.750 --> 02:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
02:46:05.910 --> 02:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
uh state employees
 
02:46:08.950 --> 02:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
uh that are covered uh and get the 12
 
02:46:11.030 --> 02:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
visits a year they
 
02:46:13.349 --> 02:46:13.359 align:start position:0%
their co-pays run between
 
02:46:15.510 --> 02:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
five dollars for the teachers ten
 
02:46:18.469 --> 02:46:18.479 align:start position:0%
dollars for the state employees whereas
 
02:46:20.150 --> 02:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
the general public
 
02:46:22.830 --> 02:46:22.840 align:start position:0%
could start at 40 and go to
 
02:46:26.230 --> 02:46:26.240 align:start position:0%
60. i would say uh as you know that
 
02:46:28.309 --> 02:46:28.319 align:start position:0%
those two entities are what we call
 
02:46:30.710 --> 02:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
self-insured erisa plans
 
02:46:32.630 --> 02:46:32.640 align:start position:0%
under federal law we do not regulate
 
02:46:34.469 --> 02:46:34.479 align:start position:0%
them and this bill will not affect
 
02:46:36.150 --> 02:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
correct affect that
 
02:46:36.160 --> 02:46:38.950 align:start position:0%
correct affect that
situation

02:46:38.950 --> 02:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
situation
 
02:46:41.030 --> 02:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much thank you for
 
02:46:44.230 --> 02:46:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:48.230 --> 02:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:49.830 --> 02:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
okay mark
 
02:46:49.840 --> 02:47:05.429 align:start position:0%
okay mark
stagnell

02:47:05.429 --> 02:47:05.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:07.349 --> 02:47:07.359 align:start position:0%
mr chairman ladies and gentlemen thank
 
02:47:09.269 --> 02:47:09.279 align:start position:0%
you once again
 
02:47:11.750 --> 02:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh my name is mark stagnone i am a
 
02:47:14.950 --> 02:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
chiropractor also in londonderry
 
02:47:17.670 --> 02:47:17.680 align:start position:0%
uh i've been practicing there for 35
 
02:47:17.680 --> 02:47:19.110 align:start position:0%
uh i've been practicing there for 35
years

02:47:19.110 --> 02:47:19.120 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:47:21.030 --> 02:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
and actually for about roughly about
 
02:47:23.349 --> 02:47:23.359 align:start position:0%
half of my career now we've been trying
 
02:47:26.309 --> 02:47:26.319 align:start position:0%
to address this particular issue related
 
02:47:30.309 --> 02:47:30.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:32.309 --> 02:47:32.319 align:start position:0%
over the years and some of our hearings
 
02:47:35.590 --> 02:47:35.600 align:start position:0%
we've gotten into cost studies cost
 
02:47:38.710 --> 02:47:38.720 align:start position:0%
shift cost analysis how effective are
 
02:47:40.950 --> 02:47:40.960 align:start position:0%
you people at you know saving money
 
02:47:42.870 --> 02:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
that's always been a long convoluted
 
02:47:45.190 --> 02:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
discussion i will stay away from it
 
02:47:48.950 --> 02:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
for this purpose of saving time for you
 
02:47:52.309 --> 02:47:52.319 align:start position:0%
our basic premise on this legislation
 
02:47:53.510 --> 02:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:47:56.469 --> 02:47:56.479 align:start position:0%
we are not specialists
 
02:48:00.150 --> 02:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
we do not practice like specialists
 
02:48:04.389 --> 02:48:04.399 align:start position:0%
our mode of care is totally different
 
02:48:07.590 --> 02:48:07.600 align:start position:0%
we are not reimbursed even remotely
 
02:48:11.110 --> 02:48:11.120 align:start position:0%
similar to specialists and therefore
 
02:48:13.990 --> 02:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
when our patients arrive and and we have
 
02:48:15.990 --> 02:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
to notify them that they have a
 
02:48:18.790 --> 02:48:18.800 align:start position:0%
specialist co-payment
 
02:48:22.070 --> 02:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
this is a complete surprise to them
 
02:48:24.950 --> 02:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
because they are typically in my office
 
02:48:26.710 --> 02:48:26.720 align:start position:0%
i don't even see the forty dollar
 
02:48:30.070 --> 02:48:30.080 align:start position:0%
specialist copay it's usually 50 and up
 
02:48:32.309 --> 02:48:32.319 align:start position:0%
and what happens in those instances is
 
02:48:35.590 --> 02:48:35.600 align:start position:0%
the patient is bearing the brunt of the
 
02:48:38.790 --> 02:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
entire cost of their care
 
02:48:42.309 --> 02:48:42.319 align:start position:0%
and this causes some of them to
 
02:48:45.190 --> 02:48:45.200 align:start position:0%
not pursue care at all
 
02:48:48.230 --> 02:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
some of them have to discontinue their
 
02:48:50.790 --> 02:48:50.800 align:start position:0%
care prematurely
 
02:48:55.030 --> 02:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
um and and we feel that this is harmful
 
02:48:55.040 --> 02:48:55.990 align:start position:0%
um and and we feel that this is harmful
to

02:48:55.990 --> 02:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:48:57.269 --> 02:48:57.279 align:start position:0%
the patient
 
02:49:00.870 --> 02:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
that it is it is an unfair practice
 
02:49:04.710 --> 02:49:04.720 align:start position:0%
uh it is implemented in a fashion as
 
02:49:06.630 --> 02:49:06.640 align:start position:0%
dr representative lundgren just
 
02:49:06.640 --> 02:49:07.990 align:start position:0%
dr representative lundgren just
mentioned

02:49:07.990 --> 02:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
02:49:09.750 --> 02:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
you know our patients that come in that
 
02:49:12.630 --> 02:49:12.640 align:start position:0%
are municipal employees police fire
 
02:49:15.030 --> 02:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
state workers
 
02:49:18.070 --> 02:49:18.080 align:start position:0%
etc generally aren't influenced by this
 
02:49:20.870 --> 02:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
in fact there are there are thousands of
 
02:49:23.269 --> 02:49:23.279 align:start position:0%
policies out there that aren't affected
 
02:49:24.830 --> 02:49:24.840 align:start position:0%
by this
 
02:49:24.840 --> 02:49:26.550 align:start position:0%
by this
particular

02:49:26.550 --> 02:49:26.560 align:start position:0%
particular
 
02:49:26.560 --> 02:49:28.230 align:start position:0%
particular
classification

02:49:28.230 --> 02:49:28.240 align:start position:0%
classification
 
02:49:30.870 --> 02:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
but there is enough of them that we see
 
02:49:33.030 --> 02:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
particularly in view of the opioid
 
02:49:36.389 --> 02:49:36.399 align:start position:0%
epidemic now we addressed this
 
02:49:39.349 --> 02:49:39.359 align:start position:0%
long before the opioid epidemic came to
 
02:49:39.359 --> 02:49:40.469 align:start position:0%
long before the opioid epidemic came to
bear

02:49:40.469 --> 02:49:40.479 align:start position:0%
bear
 
02:49:43.550 --> 02:49:43.560 align:start position:0%
and in february of
 
02:49:46.870 --> 02:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
2014 in one of our hearings i held up
 
02:49:48.389 --> 02:49:48.399 align:start position:0%
this issue
 
02:49:50.710 --> 02:49:50.720 align:start position:0%
of the union leader which was the first
 
02:49:53.990 --> 02:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
major headline relative to the opioid
 
02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:55.269 align:start position:0%
major headline relative to the opioid
epidemic

02:49:55.269 --> 02:49:55.279 align:start position:0%
epidemic
 
02:49:56.389 --> 02:49:56.399 align:start position:0%
and said
 
02:49:59.429 --> 02:49:59.439 align:start position:0%
as part of our support this is coming
 
02:50:02.150 --> 02:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
and and we need to make sure that we
 
02:50:03.830 --> 02:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
have all the tools
 
02:50:06.830 --> 02:50:06.840 align:start position:0%
which includes access
 
02:50:09.990 --> 02:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
to people like us that can enter into
 
02:50:12.710 --> 02:50:12.720 align:start position:0%
the care of these patients and keep them
 
02:50:14.389 --> 02:50:14.399 align:start position:0%
away from
 
02:50:16.870 --> 02:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
a pharmaceutically based
 
02:50:19.349 --> 02:50:19.359 align:start position:0%
decision for their care now what happens
 
02:50:21.030 --> 02:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
with some of our patients that have
 
02:50:23.590 --> 02:50:23.600 align:start position:0%
these specialist co-pays
 
02:50:25.510 --> 02:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
is they end up going to the
 
02:50:27.590 --> 02:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical care when they abandon
 
02:50:29.429 --> 02:50:29.439 align:start position:0%
their chiropractic care because they're
 
02:50:32.230 --> 02:50:32.240 align:start position:0%
carrying the entire brunt of
 
02:50:35.910 --> 02:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
their their costs and how this works is
 
02:50:37.429 --> 02:50:37.439 align:start position:0%
the insurance carrier goes to the
 
02:50:39.510 --> 02:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
employee they and those of you that are
 
02:50:41.349 --> 02:50:41.359 align:start position:0%
in small business know this every year
 
02:50:42.790 --> 02:50:42.800 align:start position:0%
you try to figure out what are we going
 
02:50:44.870 --> 02:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
to what are we going to buy this year
 
02:50:46.710 --> 02:50:46.720 align:start position:0%
and you sit down and you say well what's
 
02:50:48.870 --> 02:50:48.880 align:start position:0%
it got and they come in they saw it has
 
02:50:51.030 --> 02:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
chiropractic okay that's good my people
 
02:50:52.070 --> 02:50:52.080 align:start position:0%
like that
 
02:50:54.710 --> 02:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
and mr chairman there is been a huge
 
02:50:56.750 --> 02:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
attitude shift relative to the
 
02:50:59.030 --> 02:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
desirability of chiropractic as a
 
02:51:01.349 --> 02:51:01.359 align:start position:0%
benefit over the years in my career it
 
02:51:04.469 --> 02:51:04.479 align:start position:0%
has it has pleasantly blossomed
 
02:51:06.469 --> 02:51:06.479 align:start position:0%
and so the employer is like oh that's
 
02:51:09.190 --> 02:51:09.200 align:start position:0%
good yeah chiropractic has got it
 
02:51:11.510 --> 02:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
and then these policies show up at our
 
02:51:14.070 --> 02:51:14.080 align:start position:0%
office and we have the
 
02:51:16.389 --> 02:51:16.399 align:start position:0%
pleasure of notifying these patients so
 
02:51:19.590 --> 02:51:19.600 align:start position:0%
while you have a specialist co-pay we
 
02:51:22.150 --> 02:51:22.160 align:start position:0%
have been declared as a specialist under
 
02:51:24.469 --> 02:51:24.479 align:start position:0%
your policy there's thousands of them
 
02:51:27.030 --> 02:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
that don't have it but some of these do
 
02:51:28.230 --> 02:51:28.240 align:start position:0%
come in
 
02:51:30.309 --> 02:51:30.319 align:start position:0%
and we have to share with the patient
 
02:51:32.469 --> 02:51:32.479 align:start position:0%
now say well your care is not going to
 
02:51:35.590 --> 02:51:35.600 align:start position:0%
be covered because your co-pays up here
 
02:51:38.230 --> 02:51:38.240 align:start position:0%
and our mac which is called your maximum
 
02:51:41.510 --> 02:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
allowable charge is down here is what
 
02:51:44.150 --> 02:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
the insurance company sets our rate for
 
02:51:45.990 --> 02:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
us when we make an agreement with them
 
02:51:47.349 --> 02:51:47.359 align:start position:0%
they say we're going to pay you this
 
02:51:47.359 --> 02:51:48.230 align:start position:0%
they say we're going to pay you this
much

02:51:48.230 --> 02:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
much
 
02:51:50.230 --> 02:51:50.240 align:start position:0%
and then the specialist co-pays up here
 
02:51:53.030 --> 02:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
usually by 10 or 15 dollars separation
 
02:51:55.269 --> 02:51:55.279 align:start position:0%
and so the patients face the situation
 
02:51:56.309 --> 02:51:56.319 align:start position:0%
where they
 
02:51:58.150 --> 02:51:58.160 align:start position:0%
they just basically say
 
02:51:59.110 --> 02:51:59.120 align:start position:0%
either they're going to foot it
 
02:52:01.670 --> 02:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
themselves or or or they
 
02:52:02.790 --> 02:52:02.800 align:start position:0%
they just
 
02:52:05.670 --> 02:52:05.680 align:start position:0%
they bail out as far as that goes and
 
02:52:07.510 --> 02:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
and this is they've been a lot of
 
02:52:09.510 --> 02:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
studies now and i have to tell you some
 
02:52:11.349 --> 02:52:11.359 align:start position:0%
great research coming out of new
 
02:52:11.359 --> 02:52:12.550 align:start position:0%
great research coming out of new
hampshire

02:52:12.550 --> 02:52:12.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:52:14.710 --> 02:52:14.720 align:start position:0%
they use the the database that new
 
02:52:16.950 --> 02:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire set up there are researchers
 
02:52:19.030 --> 02:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
up at dartmouth college and some out in
 
02:52:20.950 --> 02:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
southern california that have been
 
02:52:23.670 --> 02:52:23.680 align:start position:0%
cranking out the research
 
02:52:26.070 --> 02:52:26.080 align:start position:0%
that has demonstrated
 
02:52:30.230 --> 02:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
one of them which came out in in 2015.
 
02:52:31.990 --> 02:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
they used the database from the years
 
02:52:35.110 --> 02:52:35.120 align:start position:0%
2013 and 14 they looked at 13 000 new
 
02:52:38.150 --> 02:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire residents policyholders and
 
02:52:40.710 --> 02:52:40.720 align:start position:0%
they found that there was a 55 percent
 
02:52:42.469 --> 02:52:42.479 align:start position:0%
reduced likelihood that they would
 
02:52:46.150 --> 02:52:46.160 align:start position:0%
utilize an opioid if they had
 
02:52:48.389 --> 02:52:48.399 align:start position:0%
access to chiropractic care as their
 
02:52:49.910 --> 02:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
first line
 
02:52:52.790 --> 02:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
of treatment 55 percent
 
02:52:54.469 --> 02:52:54.479 align:start position:0%
i sat down with the governor
 
02:52:56.150 --> 02:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
representative longer and i have sat
 
02:52:58.309 --> 02:52:58.319 align:start position:0%
with the governor and david meyer on
 
02:53:00.630 --> 02:53:00.640 align:start position:0%
this on this information
 
02:53:03.190 --> 02:53:03.200 align:start position:0%
we're trying to get opioid legislation
 
02:53:05.990 --> 02:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
passed it also improves access to these
 
02:53:09.190 --> 02:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
types of alternative as we love that
 
02:53:11.510 --> 02:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
term these alternative
 
02:53:13.670 --> 02:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
methods of care but they have they are
 
02:53:15.750 --> 02:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
proving time and time again
 
02:53:18.469 --> 02:53:18.479 align:start position:0%
to be beneficial in this battle against
 
02:53:21.429 --> 02:53:21.439 align:start position:0%
against the use of the opioids
 
02:53:25.110 --> 02:53:25.120 align:start position:0%
in conclusion i'd just like to say that
 
02:53:26.389 --> 02:53:26.399 align:start position:0%
you know there's even been some
 
02:53:28.070 --> 02:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
questions over the years as to the
 
02:53:28.080 --> 02:53:29.670 align:start position:0%
questions over the years as to the
legality

02:53:29.670 --> 02:53:29.680 align:start position:0%
legality
 
02:53:31.750 --> 02:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
of this type of
 
02:53:34.630 --> 02:53:34.640 align:start position:0%
behavior as far as giving us this
 
02:53:37.269 --> 02:53:37.279 align:start position:0%
special designation that doesn't fit us
 
02:53:38.950 --> 02:53:38.960 align:start position:0%
it's just not us
 
02:53:41.590 --> 02:53:41.600 align:start position:0%
and even in one of um
 
02:53:44.469 --> 02:53:44.479 align:start position:0%
my uh our interactions with mr brennan
 
02:53:46.790 --> 02:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
from the insurance company back in
 
02:53:49.429 --> 02:53:49.439 align:start position:0%
november of 2011 when we were working on
 
02:53:49.439 --> 02:53:50.309 align:start position:0%
november of 2011 when we were working on
this

02:53:50.309 --> 02:53:50.319 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:53:52.870 --> 02:53:52.880 align:start position:0%
even in his um
 
02:53:52.880 --> 02:53:53.830 align:start position:0%
even in his um
um

02:53:53.830 --> 02:53:53.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:53:56.790 --> 02:53:56.800 align:start position:0%
his correspondence with us questioned
 
02:53:59.590 --> 02:53:59.600 align:start position:0%
the legality of this he he indicated to
 
02:54:01.429 --> 02:54:01.439 align:start position:0%
us that you know that these companies
 
02:54:02.710 --> 02:54:02.720 align:start position:0%
have the ability to set their
 
02:54:04.950 --> 02:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
co-payments with their where they want
 
02:54:06.469 --> 02:54:06.479 align:start position:0%
and we agree with that
 
02:54:08.790 --> 02:54:08.800 align:start position:0%
but he did say and i quote him we do
 
02:54:11.510 --> 02:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
feel there is a potential legal issue
 
02:54:13.830 --> 02:54:13.840 align:start position:0%
with the co-payments
 
02:54:16.550 --> 02:54:16.560 align:start position:0%
exceeding what is otherwise due and that
 
02:54:18.550 --> 02:54:18.560 align:start position:0%
they were going to look into it and
 
02:54:20.389 --> 02:54:20.399 align:start position:0%
really nothing further that took place
 
02:54:23.269 --> 02:54:23.279 align:start position:0%
as far as that goes we've tried to
 
02:54:26.150 --> 02:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
work with them um
 
02:54:27.429 --> 02:54:27.439 align:start position:0%
in this
 
02:54:28.870 --> 02:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
but i i would hope that you would
 
02:54:30.630 --> 02:54:30.640 align:start position:0%
consider this
 
02:54:32.790 --> 02:54:32.800 align:start position:0%
bill very seriously
 
02:54:34.630 --> 02:54:34.640 align:start position:0%
because there are
 
02:54:36.550 --> 02:54:36.560 align:start position:0%
individuals out there that are not
 
02:54:38.630 --> 02:54:38.640 align:start position:0%
getting their proper access because of
 
02:54:43.110 --> 02:54:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:43.120 --> 02:54:44.309 align:start position:0%
 
strategy

02:54:44.309 --> 02:54:44.319 align:start position:0%
strategy
 
02:54:48.070 --> 02:54:48.080 align:start position:0%
that the insurance companies are using
 
02:54:48.080 --> 02:54:49.990 align:start position:0%
that the insurance companies are using
okay

02:54:49.990 --> 02:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:54:52.230 --> 02:54:52.240 align:start position:0%
um here are questions
 
02:54:54.070 --> 02:54:54.080 align:start position:0%
represented below
 
02:54:55.590 --> 02:54:55.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:54:56.630 --> 02:54:56.640 align:start position:0%
my question
 
02:54:58.309 --> 02:54:58.319 align:start position:0%
uh so are you considering our
 
02:55:01.670 --> 02:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
chiropractors considered
 
02:55:04.070 --> 02:55:04.080 align:start position:0%
using alternative
 
02:55:08.070 --> 02:55:08.080 align:start position:0%
treatments or similar to a naturopath
 
02:55:10.790 --> 02:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
i think our official classifications we
 
02:55:14.950 --> 02:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
are primary portal of entry
 
02:55:18.790 --> 02:55:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:22.070 --> 02:55:22.080 align:start position:0%
we're not primary care physicians
 
02:55:24.389 --> 02:55:24.399 align:start position:0%
we are primary portal in that we are
 
02:55:28.150 --> 02:55:28.160 align:start position:0%
accessible directly without a referral
 
02:55:30.550 --> 02:55:30.560 align:start position:0%
from a medical physician
 
02:55:32.389 --> 02:55:32.399 align:start position:0%
that was an issue we addressed at one
 
02:55:35.030 --> 02:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
point years ago uh mr chairman where the
 
02:55:37.349 --> 02:55:37.359 align:start position:0%
where the gatekeeper as they were
 
02:55:39.830 --> 02:55:39.840 align:start position:0%
referred to would have to give the
 
02:55:39.840 --> 02:55:41.190 align:start position:0%
referred to would have to give the
blessing

02:55:41.190 --> 02:55:41.200 align:start position:0%
blessing
 
02:55:42.389 --> 02:55:42.399 align:start position:0%
for the patient to go to the
 
02:55:45.190 --> 02:55:45.200 align:start position:0%
chiropractor so i think mr chairman was
 
02:55:47.429 --> 02:55:47.439 align:start position:0%
influential in helping us
 
02:55:49.670 --> 02:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
address that issue
 
02:55:52.150 --> 02:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
and now we're hopeful that this part of
 
02:55:54.230 --> 02:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
the issue i mean we're just constantly
 
02:55:54.240 --> 02:55:55.269 align:start position:0%
the issue i mean we're just constantly
fighting

02:55:55.269 --> 02:55:55.279 align:start position:0%
fighting
 
02:55:55.279 --> 02:55:57.349 align:start position:0%
fighting
strategies

02:55:57.349 --> 02:55:57.359 align:start position:0%
strategies
 
02:55:59.030 --> 02:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
that come around that
 
02:56:02.070 --> 02:56:02.080 align:start position:0%
are meant to restrict you know
 
02:56:03.910 --> 02:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
our ability i mean
 
02:56:06.710 --> 02:56:06.720 align:start position:0%
we they can limit the number of visits
 
02:56:08.389 --> 02:56:08.399 align:start position:0%
they limit the amount that they're going
 
02:56:10.230 --> 02:56:10.240 align:start position:0%
to pay us
 
02:56:12.550 --> 02:56:12.560 align:start position:0%
but this this part is most painful
 
02:56:14.870 --> 02:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
because it it throws the financial
 
02:56:20.230 --> 02:56:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:22.630 --> 02:56:22.640 align:start position:0%
okay representative johnson
 
02:56:24.830 --> 02:56:24.840 align:start position:0%
i have more of a would you
 
02:56:26.950 --> 02:56:26.960 align:start position:0%
believe that
 
02:56:29.670 --> 02:56:29.680 align:start position:0%
i actually have a i'm very grateful for
 
02:56:31.429 --> 02:56:31.439 align:start position:0%
an insurance policy that gives me
 
02:56:33.590 --> 02:56:33.600 align:start position:0%
unlimited chiropractic
 
02:56:35.269 --> 02:56:35.279 align:start position:0%
which has been beneficial because it's
 
02:56:37.429 --> 02:56:37.439 align:start position:0%
kept me pretty healthy over the last 10
 
02:56:39.030 --> 02:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
20 years
 
02:56:41.670 --> 02:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
and my co-pays are pretty low because
 
02:56:44.150 --> 02:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
the insurance company that we have
 
02:56:47.190 --> 02:56:47.200 align:start position:0%
um allows unlimited chiropractic
 
02:56:48.710 --> 02:56:48.720 align:start position:0%
for my whole family
 
02:56:52.950 --> 02:56:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:56.150 --> 02:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
well yeah i mean to me it's
 
02:56:57.830 --> 02:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
much more affordable than going to a
 
02:57:00.309 --> 02:57:00.319 align:start position:0%
surgeon you know you know which is what
 
02:57:01.670 --> 02:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
i hear people do all the time which
 
02:57:04.469 --> 02:57:04.479 align:start position:0%
seems insane to me but um
 
02:57:08.550 --> 02:57:08.560 align:start position:0%
so i guess my question is due
 
02:57:10.309 --> 02:57:10.319 align:start position:0%
i guess i dare to do this because i
 
02:57:13.670 --> 02:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
really shouldn't but i um
 
02:57:16.150 --> 02:57:16.160 align:start position:0%
which companies are doing it because i'm
 
02:57:19.510 --> 02:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
worried that that um the
 
02:57:21.510 --> 02:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
we only can affect this legislation and
 
02:57:24.469 --> 02:57:24.479 align:start position:0%
only affect small group health insurance
 
02:57:27.830 --> 02:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
in individuals so i'm just wondering
 
02:57:27.840 --> 02:57:29.269 align:start position:0%
in individuals so i'm just wondering
um

02:57:29.269 --> 02:57:29.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:57:31.269 --> 02:57:31.279 align:start position:0%
is anthem and harvard are is that are
 
02:57:33.910 --> 02:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
they part of the problem well i can i
 
02:57:35.830 --> 02:57:35.840 align:start position:0%
can share with you that
 
02:57:38.710 --> 02:57:38.720 align:start position:0%
anthem was
 
02:57:41.670 --> 02:57:41.680 align:start position:0%
the initiator of this
 
02:57:41.680 --> 02:57:43.670 align:start position:0%
the initiator of this
strategy

02:57:43.670 --> 02:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
strategy
 
02:57:43.680 --> 02:57:45.190 align:start position:0%
strategy
and

02:57:45.190 --> 02:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:57:47.510 --> 02:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
actually we tried the work directly with
 
02:57:47.520 --> 02:57:49.510 align:start position:0%
actually we tried the work directly with
anthem

02:57:49.510 --> 02:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
anthem
 
02:57:51.510 --> 02:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
the first hearing we had on this was
 
02:57:53.269 --> 02:57:53.279 align:start position:0%
actually over in the senate commerce
 
02:57:54.870 --> 02:57:54.880 align:start position:0%
committee and at the time that the
 
02:57:54.880 --> 02:57:56.469 align:start position:0%
committee and at the time that the
chairman

02:57:56.469 --> 02:57:56.479 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
02:57:58.710 --> 02:57:58.720 align:start position:0%
he didn't want to mandate this he
 
02:58:00.389 --> 02:58:00.399 align:start position:0%
thought that the marketplace might be
 
02:58:03.269 --> 02:58:03.279 align:start position:0%
able to help you know manage this
 
02:58:05.110 --> 02:58:05.120 align:start position:0%
problem it hasn't
 
02:58:08.389 --> 02:58:08.399 align:start position:0%
um but i will never forget
 
02:58:09.910 --> 02:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
in that hearing
 
02:58:11.510 --> 02:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
the chairman pointed at the
 
02:58:14.389 --> 02:58:14.399 align:start position:0%
representative from anthem and he said
 
02:58:17.429 --> 02:58:17.439 align:start position:0%
this isn't right you need to fix it
 
02:58:19.110 --> 02:58:19.120 align:start position:0%
and that's pretty much how the hearing
 
02:58:21.110 --> 02:58:21.120 align:start position:0%
ended and we were optimistic but nothing
 
02:58:22.389 --> 02:58:22.399 align:start position:0%
ever happened
 
02:58:25.110 --> 02:58:25.120 align:start position:0%
now what now what happened also as we
 
02:58:26.950 --> 02:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
were back and forth communicating with
 
02:58:29.110 --> 02:58:29.120 align:start position:0%
them there was a point in time in april
 
02:58:31.110 --> 02:58:31.120 align:start position:0%
of 2011
 
02:58:34.630 --> 02:58:34.640 align:start position:0%
in our uh interactions with paula rogers
 
02:58:36.389 --> 02:58:36.399 align:start position:0%
from from anthem
 
02:58:39.190 --> 02:58:39.200 align:start position:0%
where in her communication to with mr
 
02:58:41.590 --> 02:58:41.600 align:start position:0%
james monahan who was
 
02:58:43.670 --> 02:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
our lobbyist at the time
 
02:58:46.150 --> 02:58:46.160 align:start position:0%
when they actually indicated to us that
 
02:58:48.230 --> 02:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
that they couldn't change this
 
02:58:50.550 --> 02:58:50.560 align:start position:0%
designation because their computer
 
02:58:52.230 --> 02:58:52.240 align:start position:0%
systems were
 
02:58:55.830 --> 02:58:55.840 align:start position:0%
were a multi-state and and they couldn't
 
02:58:57.670 --> 02:58:57.680 align:start position:0%
assure us that
 
02:58:58.870 --> 02:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
with any
 
02:59:01.110 --> 02:59:01.120 align:start position:0%
time element or anything of that nature
 
02:59:02.870 --> 02:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
that they would be able to fix this
 
02:59:05.750 --> 02:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
anytime soon that it was a computer
 
02:59:07.269 --> 02:59:07.279 align:start position:0%
system issue
 
02:59:09.990 --> 02:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
and so once again
 
02:59:11.910 --> 02:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
we were left kind of you know kicking
 
02:59:13.830 --> 02:59:13.840 align:start position:0%
the can down the road someone this is
 
02:59:16.150 --> 02:59:16.160 align:start position:0%
why we keep coming back on on this this
 
02:59:18.630 --> 02:59:18.640 align:start position:0%
issue it hasn't gone away in fact what
 
02:59:20.389 --> 02:59:20.399 align:start position:0%
has happened is that
 
02:59:22.630 --> 02:59:22.640 align:start position:0%
there have been other
 
02:59:25.510 --> 02:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
insurance companies that have
 
02:59:27.510 --> 02:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
probably noticed the effect
 
02:59:30.309 --> 02:59:30.319 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of this strategy
 
02:59:33.349 --> 02:59:33.359 align:start position:0%
and we have started to see these
 
02:59:36.309 --> 02:59:36.319 align:start position:0%
these specialist co-pays creep up in
 
02:59:37.429 --> 02:59:37.439 align:start position:0%
some other
 
02:59:39.269 --> 02:59:39.279 align:start position:0%
policies as well
 
02:59:42.070 --> 02:59:42.080 align:start position:0%
but i would suggest to you that it began
 
02:59:43.510 --> 02:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
with the anthem
 
02:59:43.520 --> 02:59:45.429 align:start position:0%
with the anthem
okay

02:59:45.429 --> 02:59:45.439 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:59:47.590 --> 02:59:47.600 align:start position:0%
uh representative macular just a quick
 
02:59:50.150 --> 02:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
question if we if this bill passed
 
02:59:51.830 --> 02:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
do you see any way that the insurance
 
02:59:53.429 --> 02:59:53.439 align:start position:0%
companies could
 
02:59:59.429 --> 02:59:59.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:02.790 --> 03:00:02.800 align:start position:0%
well i'm sure there there is something
 
03:00:05.429 --> 03:00:05.439 align:start position:0%
you know that that could take place i'm
 
03:00:07.910 --> 03:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not savvy with
 
03:00:08.870 --> 03:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
the the
 
03:00:10.710 --> 03:00:10.720 align:start position:0%
with the possibilities that would be
 
03:00:10.720 --> 03:00:11.750 align:start position:0%
with the possibilities that would be
there

03:00:11.750 --> 03:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:00:15.269 --> 03:00:15.279 align:start position:0%
uh my hope is that and in being here
 
03:00:17.429 --> 03:00:17.439 align:start position:0%
talking about this that there's not some
 
03:00:19.830 --> 03:00:19.840 align:start position:0%
type of punitive um
 
03:00:23.590 --> 03:00:23.600 align:start position:0%
uh result that would occur either to us
 
03:00:26.870 --> 03:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
as a profession or our patients uh
 
03:00:29.429 --> 03:00:29.439 align:start position:0%
if some of these strategies were
 
03:00:32.070 --> 03:00:32.080 align:start position:0%
to be to be nullified but
 
03:00:33.910 --> 03:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
but you know
 
03:00:35.990 --> 03:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
there are there are thousands of these
 
03:00:38.630 --> 03:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
policies out there that are working very
 
03:00:38.640 --> 03:00:39.510 align:start position:0%
policies out there that are working very
well

03:00:39.510 --> 03:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:00:41.990 --> 03:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
for them i mean we don't hear
 
03:00:44.469 --> 03:00:44.479 align:start position:0%
from the police or fire or teachers
 
03:00:46.389 --> 03:00:46.399 align:start position:0%
where they're saying oh gee the the
 
03:00:48.389 --> 03:00:48.399 align:start position:0%
chiropractors are running us broke you
 
03:00:49.990 --> 03:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
know in fact the studies that are out
 
03:00:51.670 --> 03:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
there demonstrate that as you increase
 
03:00:55.190 --> 03:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
utilization for chiropractic utilization
 
03:00:58.389 --> 03:00:58.399 align:start position:0%
you reduce costs on the medical side of
 
03:00:59.750 --> 03:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
that equation
 
03:01:02.389 --> 03:01:02.399 align:start position:0%
we end up and there are so many studies
 
03:01:04.150 --> 03:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
that we have submitted on this over the
 
03:01:08.150 --> 03:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
years where other anthems tennessee
 
03:01:09.590 --> 03:01:09.600 align:start position:0%
anthem in
 
03:01:11.510 --> 03:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
2010 i think it was
 
03:01:11.520 --> 03:01:12.630 align:start position:0%
2010 i think it was
witnessed

03:01:12.630 --> 03:01:12.640 align:start position:0%
witnessed
 
03:01:15.110 --> 03:01:15.120 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars of savings
 
03:01:17.190 --> 03:01:17.200 align:start position:0%
when they increased their access to
 
03:01:20.790 --> 03:01:20.800 align:start position:0%
chiropractic so we're not trying to
 
03:01:20.800 --> 03:01:22.230 align:start position:0%
chiropractic so we're not trying to
burden

03:01:22.230 --> 03:01:22.240 align:start position:0%
burden
 
03:01:25.349 --> 03:01:25.359 align:start position:0%
uh the insurance companies with this uh
 
03:01:27.349 --> 03:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
with this we really think and we truly
 
03:01:29.349 --> 03:01:29.359 align:start position:0%
believe that if they actually used us
 
03:01:31.830 --> 03:01:31.840 align:start position:0%
more that there they would see cost
 
03:01:34.710 --> 03:01:34.720 align:start position:0%
savings we would see beneficial results
 
03:01:37.349 --> 03:01:37.359 align:start position:0%
in the opioid
 
03:01:37.359 --> 03:01:39.349 align:start position:0%
in the opioid
crisis

03:01:39.349 --> 03:01:39.359 align:start position:0%
crisis
 
03:01:41.110 --> 03:01:41.120 align:start position:0%
so many studies that are coming out of
 
03:01:43.269 --> 03:01:43.279 align:start position:0%
dartmouth on this and i'm happy to share
 
03:01:45.190 --> 03:01:45.200 align:start position:0%
these studies with you
 
03:01:46.950 --> 03:01:46.960 align:start position:0%
in whatever fashion you would ever want
 
03:01:48.710 --> 03:01:48.720 align:start position:0%
me to
 
03:01:50.550 --> 03:01:50.560 align:start position:0%
but i would just say that
 
03:01:53.110 --> 03:01:53.120 align:start position:0%
i'm sure there are strategies but i just
 
03:01:55.830 --> 03:01:55.840 align:start position:0%
don't know what they would be
 
03:01:57.110 --> 03:01:57.120 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much for your
 
03:01:58.469 --> 03:01:58.479 align:start position:0%
testimony mr chairman thank you very
 
03:02:00.950 --> 03:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
much okay
 
03:02:05.030 --> 03:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh chair we'll call on dr ken gabriel
 
03:02:06.389 --> 03:02:06.399 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire chiropractic
 
03:02:06.399 --> 03:02:09.429 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire chiropractic
association

03:02:09.429 --> 03:02:09.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:14.309 --> 03:02:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:17.030 --> 03:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
hello mr chairman thank you um i'd like
 
03:02:19.190 --> 03:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
to apologize in advance
 
03:02:20.790 --> 03:02:20.800 align:start position:0%
i'm a little nervous i'm not a public
 
03:02:23.429 --> 03:02:23.439 align:start position:0%
speaker this is uh very intimidating to
 
03:02:23.439 --> 03:02:24.230 align:start position:0%
speaker this is uh very intimidating to
me

03:02:24.230 --> 03:02:24.240 align:start position:0%
me
 
03:02:25.510 --> 03:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:02:27.750 --> 03:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
just forgive my passion forgive my
 
03:02:30.550 --> 03:02:30.560 align:start position:0%
emotion as i approach the subject from a
 
03:02:34.309 --> 03:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
more anecdotal personal side having lost
 
03:02:36.230 --> 03:02:36.240 align:start position:0%
family members to opioid addiction and
 
03:02:38.070 --> 03:02:38.080 align:start position:0%
i'm sure i'm not the only one
 
03:02:40.550 --> 03:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
in the room who has suffered loss
 
03:02:43.190 --> 03:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
from this epidemic
 
03:02:45.750 --> 03:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
i want to speak in support of this bill
 
03:02:47.670 --> 03:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
from that perspective because i feel
 
03:02:49.830 --> 03:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
like this is an opportunity
 
03:02:51.349 --> 03:02:51.359 align:start position:0%
to make a difference
 
03:02:53.590 --> 03:02:53.600 align:start position:0%
this is an opportunity for this group in
 
03:02:55.030 --> 03:02:55.040 align:start position:0%
this room
 
03:02:57.110 --> 03:02:57.120 align:start position:0%
to look at this situation and try to
 
03:02:59.990 --> 03:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
take a small step in the right direction
 
03:03:02.550 --> 03:03:02.560 align:start position:0%
in addressing the chronic pain
 
03:03:06.070 --> 03:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
issues in this state and in this country
 
03:03:08.070 --> 03:03:08.080 align:start position:0%
i happened to watch a tv series this
 
03:03:09.510 --> 03:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
week called dope sick and i don't know
 
03:03:11.510 --> 03:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
if anybody has seen it but i suggest you
 
03:03:13.750 --> 03:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
look at it on hulu it's a very
 
03:03:13.760 --> 03:03:15.990 align:start position:0%
look at it on hulu it's a very
disturbing

03:03:15.990 --> 03:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
disturbing
 
03:03:18.469 --> 03:03:18.479 align:start position:0%
tv series with based in fact about the
 
03:03:20.950 --> 03:03:20.960 align:start position:0%
opioid epidemic and its beginnings and i
 
03:03:22.950 --> 03:03:22.960 align:start position:0%
think it rings true on an anecdotal
 
03:03:26.150 --> 03:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
level in my life and i'm sure if you uh
 
03:03:28.070 --> 03:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
see this series it may ring true in your
 
03:03:29.349 --> 03:03:29.359 align:start position:0%
life as well
 
03:03:31.110 --> 03:03:31.120 align:start position:0%
i think we have an opportunity as a
 
03:03:31.120 --> 03:03:32.389 align:start position:0%
i think we have an opportunity as a
profession

03:03:32.389 --> 03:03:32.399 align:start position:0%
profession
 
03:03:35.510 --> 03:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
to get in the trenches as dr stagnone
 
03:03:38.070 --> 03:03:38.080 align:start position:0%
stated we are
 
03:03:39.830 --> 03:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
portal of entry what does that mean that
 
03:03:42.550 --> 03:03:42.560 align:start position:0%
means we are first line of defense
 
03:03:44.389 --> 03:03:44.399 align:start position:0%
when somebody hurts their back they have
 
03:03:46.230 --> 03:03:46.240 align:start position:0%
a choice and we know that there are
 
03:03:48.710 --> 03:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
studies out there that say if you pick
 
03:03:50.870 --> 03:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
up the phone and call a chiropractor you
 
03:03:50.880 --> 03:03:51.469 align:start position:0%
up the phone and call a chiropractor you
are

03:03:51.469 --> 03:03:51.479 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:03:54.630 --> 03:03:54.640 align:start position:0%
47.2 percent less likely to go to
 
03:03:54.640 --> 03:03:55.910 align:start position:0%
47.2 percent less likely to go to
surgery

03:03:55.910 --> 03:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
surgery
 
03:03:57.750 --> 03:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
that's a huge statistic and i can get
 
03:03:59.190 --> 03:03:59.200 align:start position:0%
you that study
 
03:04:01.670 --> 03:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
so who you pick up and call as the first
 
03:04:03.110 --> 03:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
line of defense
 
03:04:06.630 --> 03:04:06.640 align:start position:0%
is certainly a great way to
 
03:04:06.640 --> 03:04:07.670 align:start position:0%
is certainly a great way to
limit

03:04:07.670 --> 03:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
limit
 
03:04:10.550 --> 03:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
the entryway into the opioid
 
03:04:13.349 --> 03:04:13.359 align:start position:0%
epidemic for for those people so the
 
03:04:15.269 --> 03:04:15.279 align:start position:0%
chiropractors there is nobody more
 
03:04:17.429 --> 03:04:17.439 align:start position:0%
competent in this country to treat lower
 
03:04:19.110 --> 03:04:19.120 align:start position:0%
back pain as a matter of fact on the way
 
03:04:20.870 --> 03:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
in today i had a chance to look up the
 
03:04:23.590 --> 03:04:23.600 align:start position:0%
top three reasons why people go to see a
 
03:04:25.349 --> 03:04:25.359 align:start position:0%
primary care physician
 
03:04:27.670 --> 03:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
the first one was skin conditions the
 
03:04:30.070 --> 03:04:30.080 align:start position:0%
second one was osteoarthritis
 
03:04:32.150 --> 03:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
the third one was back pain
 
03:04:35.030 --> 03:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
two out of the three chiropractors are
 
03:04:37.429 --> 03:04:37.439 align:start position:0%
ready to deal with on the first level
 
03:04:38.870 --> 03:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
basis now that doesn't mean we don't
 
03:04:40.950 --> 03:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
send people for surgery if they need
 
03:04:43.190 --> 03:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
surgery that doesn't mean we don't send
 
03:04:43.200 --> 03:04:44.070 align:start position:0%
surgery that doesn't mean we don't send
people

03:04:44.070 --> 03:04:44.080 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:04:44.080 --> 03:04:44.950 align:start position:0%
people
for

03:04:44.950 --> 03:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:04:47.190 --> 03:04:47.200 align:start position:0%
pharmacological treatment if necessary
 
03:04:49.830 --> 03:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
but it's a lot less likely and it's an
 
03:04:51.510 --> 03:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
alternative and now we're gaining
 
03:04:54.070 --> 03:04:54.080 align:start position:0%
support by many different
 
03:04:56.550 --> 03:04:56.560 align:start position:0%
studies that say that medical care
 
03:04:58.389 --> 03:04:58.399 align:start position:0%
combined with chiropractic care and
 
03:05:00.550 --> 03:05:00.560 align:start position:0%
alternative care and other forms of
 
03:05:03.190 --> 03:05:03.200 align:start position:0%
conservative therapy are really
 
03:05:05.590 --> 03:05:05.600 align:start position:0%
much better than medical care by itself
 
03:05:07.910 --> 03:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
and pharmacological intervention so
 
03:05:09.830 --> 03:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
again we're looking to work with the
 
03:05:12.469 --> 03:05:12.479 align:start position:0%
medical field we're not looking to be
 
03:05:14.469 --> 03:05:14.479 align:start position:0%
to be the primary source here but we
 
03:05:17.429 --> 03:05:17.439 align:start position:0%
want to do our part we are educated to
 
03:05:20.309 --> 03:05:20.319 align:start position:0%
do our part we we are the best spinal
 
03:05:22.550 --> 03:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
manipulators in the world people from
 
03:05:24.230 --> 03:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
across the world come
 
03:05:26.710 --> 03:05:26.720 align:start position:0%
to the united states where chiropractic
 
03:05:30.469 --> 03:05:30.479 align:start position:0%
was developed and studied and researched
 
03:05:30.479 --> 03:05:32.150 align:start position:0%
was developed and studied and researched
so

03:05:32.150 --> 03:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:05:34.389 --> 03:05:34.399 align:start position:0%
taking my passion and saying this is an
 
03:05:36.150 --> 03:05:36.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity for us
 
03:05:39.349 --> 03:05:39.359 align:start position:0%
to make a small step and to bring equity
 
03:05:41.030 --> 03:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
back to the patient and give the choice
 
03:05:42.790 --> 03:05:42.800 align:start position:0%
back to the patient so it's not an
 
03:05:45.750 --> 03:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
economic choice i can't afford six
 
03:05:48.150 --> 03:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
visits to the chiropractor it's 70
 
03:05:51.269 --> 03:05:51.279 align:start position:0%
dollar copay that's 420 dollars i don't
 
03:05:53.670 --> 03:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
have is what i hear i heard it today
 
03:05:55.990 --> 03:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
this morning seeing a patient doc i know
 
03:05:57.910 --> 03:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
you want me to come for six visits i can
 
03:05:59.510 --> 03:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
afford two
 
03:06:02.309 --> 03:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
it severely limits my ability to treat a
 
03:06:04.550 --> 03:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
patient and it's hurting the people of
 
03:06:06.469 --> 03:06:06.479 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and i encourage you to
 
03:06:08.630 --> 03:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
vote for this bill for that reason
 
03:06:11.670 --> 03:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:13.269 --> 03:06:13.279 align:start position:0%
representative greeson
 
03:06:15.670 --> 03:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
thank you sir for uh for your testimony
 
03:06:17.830 --> 03:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
by being one of these
 
03:06:22.070 --> 03:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
first the line of first line of defense
 
03:06:23.590 --> 03:06:23.600 align:start position:0%
do you
 
03:06:27.030 --> 03:06:27.040 align:start position:0%
experience the access issues
 
03:06:28.630 --> 03:06:28.640 align:start position:0%
that we have heard about especially with
 
03:06:30.950 --> 03:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
mental health care
 
03:06:30.960 --> 03:06:32.230 align:start position:0%
mental health care
because

03:06:32.230 --> 03:06:32.240 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:06:34.389 --> 03:06:34.399 align:start position:0%
they require a referral and there may
 
03:06:36.070 --> 03:06:36.080 align:start position:0%
not be enough providers in the network
 
03:06:38.389 --> 03:06:38.399 align:start position:0%
taking new patients
 
03:06:39.830 --> 03:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
since you are a first line of defense
 
03:06:41.510 --> 03:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
where they can call you directly is
 
03:06:44.230 --> 03:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
there an issue with lack of access and
 
03:06:46.550 --> 03:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
then just on top of that would are you
 
03:06:48.630 --> 03:06:48.640 align:start position:0%
aware of the the multi-billion dollar
 
03:06:50.150 --> 03:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
settlement against johnson and johnson
 
03:06:51.990 --> 03:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
just this week for their involvement in
 
03:06:53.910 --> 03:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
the opioid crisis
 
03:06:56.070 --> 03:06:56.080 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of of the johnson johnson
 
03:06:57.670 --> 03:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
situation but i can assure you there are
 
03:07:00.309 --> 03:07:00.319 align:start position:0%
400 practicing chiropractors in the
 
03:07:02.150 --> 03:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire we have 400
 
03:07:03.990 --> 03:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
licenses in the state
 
03:07:05.910 --> 03:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
we do have some difficulties with the
 
03:07:07.750 --> 03:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
more rural areas
 
03:07:09.429 --> 03:07:09.439 align:start position:0%
you know most of us tend to be
 
03:07:12.230 --> 03:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
concentrated in the more populist areas
 
03:07:14.150 --> 03:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
but new hampshire is a small state we
 
03:07:16.309 --> 03:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
have 400 practicing chiropractors new
 
03:07:18.070 --> 03:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire is a great state to live in
 
03:07:20.070 --> 03:07:20.080 align:start position:0%
and i know that we're adding licenses
 
03:07:21.990 --> 03:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
every year we add licenses we're not
 
03:07:23.910 --> 03:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
losing licenses every year we're
 
03:07:25.510 --> 03:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
actually adding licenses every year
 
03:07:27.269 --> 03:07:27.279 align:start position:0%
which is a great positive sign for our
 
03:07:29.269 --> 03:07:29.279 align:start position:0%
profession and for our state in terms of
 
03:07:32.550 --> 03:07:32.560 align:start position:0%
access that's great
 
03:07:34.790 --> 03:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much thank you
 
03:07:37.110 --> 03:07:37.120 align:start position:0%
we got one more card left michelle
 
03:07:39.510 --> 03:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
heaton from the insurance department
 
03:07:45.830 --> 03:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:48.309 --> 03:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
hello again michelle heaton health law
 
03:07:49.510 --> 03:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
and policy legal counsel for the
 
03:07:51.349 --> 03:07:51.359 align:start position:0%
insurance department
 
03:07:52.870 --> 03:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
as you said we don't take a position on
 
03:07:54.230 --> 03:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
this we just want to provide some
 
03:07:57.190 --> 03:07:57.200 align:start position:0%
background for this bill
 
03:07:59.590 --> 03:07:59.600 align:start position:0%
we do have currently under our statutes
 
03:07:59.600 --> 03:08:03.190 align:start position:0%
we do have currently under our statutes
rsa420j6-b

03:08:03.190 --> 03:08:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:05.429 --> 03:08:05.439 align:start position:0%
self-referrals for chiropractor this is
 
03:08:07.030 --> 03:08:07.040 align:start position:0%
the bill that i think
 
03:08:09.030 --> 03:08:09.040 align:start position:0%
has been mentioned several times that
 
03:08:09.040 --> 03:08:10.070 align:start position:0%
has been mentioned several times that
allows

03:08:10.070 --> 03:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
allows
 
03:08:12.870 --> 03:08:12.880 align:start position:0%
if chiropractic coverage is part of your
 
03:08:15.030 --> 03:08:15.040 align:start position:0%
insurance plan then you're entitled to
 
03:08:17.110 --> 03:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
at least 12 visits
 
03:08:19.990 --> 03:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
without a referral
 
03:08:21.230 --> 03:08:21.240 align:start position:0%
back in
 
03:08:25.349 --> 03:08:25.359 align:start position:0%
2014 we did have a bill that passed that
 
03:08:27.990 --> 03:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
implemented cost-sharing parity
 
03:08:31.349 --> 03:08:31.359 align:start position:0%
for chiropractic and pcp as part of that
 
03:08:34.230 --> 03:08:34.240 align:start position:0%
bill the department was required to do a
 
03:08:36.389 --> 03:08:36.399 align:start position:0%
couple studies to see how this panned
 
03:08:39.030 --> 03:08:39.040 align:start position:0%
out over time so the first study was
 
03:08:39.040 --> 03:08:39.830 align:start position:0%
out over time so the first study was
done

03:08:39.830 --> 03:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
done
 
03:08:42.389 --> 03:08:42.399 align:start position:0%
in 2014 to kind of get a lay of the land
 
03:08:44.389 --> 03:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
and then another updated one was done at
 
03:08:47.110 --> 03:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
the end of 2017 which is when the parity
 
03:08:49.750 --> 03:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
requirement sunseted
 
03:08:53.110 --> 03:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
when we looked back
 
03:08:55.030 --> 03:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
well starting with the the
 
03:08:57.750 --> 03:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
2014 report
 
03:09:00.710 --> 03:09:00.720 align:start position:0%
its conclusions were that consistent
 
03:09:03.110 --> 03:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
with other studies lower co-payment
 
03:09:04.550 --> 03:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
levels were associated with higher
 
03:09:06.550 --> 03:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
spending on those services
 
03:09:08.630 --> 03:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
the findings suggest that there was
 
03:09:09.990 --> 03:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
partial substitution between
 
03:09:11.830 --> 03:09:11.840 align:start position:0%
chiropractic services and other medical
 
03:09:14.070 --> 03:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
services although not enough to offset
 
03:09:15.990 --> 03:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
the system-wide cost of chiropractic
 
03:09:16.000 --> 03:09:17.030 align:start position:0%
the system-wide cost of chiropractic
care

03:09:17.030 --> 03:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
care
 
03:09:19.190 --> 03:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
and consistent with past studies it was
 
03:09:21.510 --> 03:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
found that any use of and the amount of
 
03:09:23.990 --> 03:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
use of chiropractic care was associated
 
03:09:26.309 --> 03:09:26.319 align:start position:0%
with lower use of opioids
 
03:09:29.429 --> 03:09:29.439 align:start position:0%
so that was our starting point in 2017
 
03:09:31.990 --> 03:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
the report came out in january of 2018
 
03:09:34.070 --> 03:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
we looked back at what happened with
 
03:09:36.550 --> 03:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
this parity requirement and generally
 
03:09:38.790 --> 03:09:38.800 align:start position:0%
equalized cost sharing with primary care
 
03:09:40.790 --> 03:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
services occurred but increased cost
 
03:09:43.670 --> 03:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
sharing for primary care so there was
 
03:09:46.469 --> 03:09:46.479 align:start position:0%
parity between this but overall the cost
 
03:09:50.469 --> 03:09:50.479 align:start position:0%
of the co-pay amounts did go up
 
03:09:52.150 --> 03:09:52.160 align:start position:0%
there was no assumptions made about this
 
03:09:54.469 --> 03:09:54.479 align:start position:0%
relationship though
 
03:09:56.870 --> 03:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
cairo cost sharing declined slightly and
 
03:09:58.630 --> 03:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
utilization increased
 
03:10:00.469 --> 03:10:00.479 align:start position:0%
lower cost sharing was associated with
 
03:10:02.070 --> 03:10:02.080 align:start position:0%
higher utilization of chiropractic
 
03:10:02.080 --> 03:10:03.269 align:start position:0%
higher utilization of chiropractic
services

03:10:03.269 --> 03:10:03.279 align:start position:0%
services
 
03:10:05.030 --> 03:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
and after risk
 
03:10:05.040 --> 03:10:06.309 align:start position:0%
and after risk
adjustment

03:10:06.309 --> 03:10:06.319 align:start position:0%
adjustment
 
03:10:08.150 --> 03:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
an increase in spending on chiropractic
 
03:10:10.710 --> 03:10:10.720 align:start position:0%
services is associated with an increase
 
03:10:12.870 --> 03:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
in total spending when considering all
 
03:10:14.630 --> 03:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
the conditions which chiropractic care
 
03:10:16.150 --> 03:10:16.160 align:start position:0%
is used there is not enough of a
 
03:10:18.710 --> 03:10:18.720 align:start position:0%
reduction in other services to make up
 
03:10:20.469 --> 03:10:20.479 align:start position:0%
for the increase in chiropractic
 
03:10:22.790 --> 03:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
services spending this results in an
 
03:10:25.030 --> 03:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
overall increase in total spending
 
03:10:26.710 --> 03:10:26.720 align:start position:0%
and there was an association though not
 
03:10:28.950 --> 03:10:28.960 align:start position:0%
statistically significant between use of
 
03:10:31.269 --> 03:10:31.279 align:start position:0%
chiropractic care and lower opioid use
 
03:10:33.510 --> 03:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
so like i said in 2017 these provisions
 
03:10:35.910 --> 03:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
sunseted so currently there is no parity
 
03:10:37.750 --> 03:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
requirement but i think a lot of the
 
03:10:39.590 --> 03:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
testimony we've heard is the overall
 
03:10:41.429 --> 03:10:41.439 align:start position:0%
cost of chiropractic care
 
03:10:41.439 --> 03:10:42.950 align:start position:0%
cost of chiropractic care
and

03:10:42.950 --> 03:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:10:44.710 --> 03:10:44.720 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage of that and i don't
 
03:10:46.150 --> 03:10:46.160 align:start position:0%
think necessarily that this bill is
 
03:10:48.150 --> 03:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
going to address those issues i don't
 
03:10:49.590 --> 03:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
have to take any questions and also
 
03:10:51.190 --> 03:10:51.200 align:start position:0%
those two reports are available on the
 
03:10:53.030 --> 03:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
insurance department's website if you
 
03:10:55.269 --> 03:10:55.279 align:start position:0%
want to read up on it and get
 
03:10:57.030 --> 03:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
your mind just sending us the link where
 
03:10:59.670 --> 03:10:59.680 align:start position:0%
it is so we can we can find that so i
 
03:11:02.229 --> 03:11:02.239 align:start position:0%
think that would be very helpful
 
03:11:04.710 --> 03:11:04.720 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
03:11:09.910 --> 03:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:11.349 --> 03:11:11.359 align:start position:0%
so representative burrows i just
 
03:11:15.190 --> 03:11:15.200 align:start position:0%
remembered we we passed a limitation on
 
03:11:18.229 --> 03:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
insulin for diabetics
 
03:11:19.429 --> 03:11:19.439 align:start position:0%
we capped
 
03:11:21.750 --> 03:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
the copays and deductibles at a hundred
 
03:11:21.760 --> 03:11:23.670 align:start position:0%
the copays and deductibles at a hundred
dollars

03:11:23.670 --> 03:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:11:26.309 --> 03:11:26.319 align:start position:0%
i think if i'm correct
 
03:11:26.319 --> 03:11:27.830 align:start position:0%
i think if i'm correct
um

03:11:27.830 --> 03:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:11:31.830 --> 03:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
so this is 12 45. uh lindsay nano from
 
03:11:34.150 --> 03:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
cigna is opposed and heidi kroll from
 
03:11:36.469 --> 03:11:36.479 align:start position:0%
ahip is also opposed
 
03:11:36.479 --> 03:11:37.830 align:start position:0%
ahip is also opposed
and

03:11:37.830 --> 03:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:11:41.910 --> 03:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
do i have this is 12 45 which one
 
03:11:44.309 --> 03:11:44.319 align:start position:0%
midnight writer
 
03:11:49.110 --> 03:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
59 people in support and nobody opposed
 
03:12:02.830 --> 03:12:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:05.190 --> 03:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
hearing you survive
 
04:07:31.670 --> 04:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:31.680 --> 04:26:43.189 align:start position:0%
 
maybe

04:26:43.189 --> 04:26:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:45.189 --> 04:26:45.199 align:start position:0%
okay do we do we have the sign-in cheat
 
04:26:47.269 --> 04:26:47.279 align:start position:0%
does anybody see the the clipboard with
 
04:26:52.710 --> 04:26:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:57.189 --> 04:26:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:57.199 --> 04:26:58.950 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:26:58.950 --> 04:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:26:59.990 --> 04:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:27:03.110 --> 04:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
so um why don't we have some
 
04:27:04.870 --> 04:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity for people to introduce
 
04:27:06.790 --> 04:27:06.800 align:start position:0%

04:33:27.349 --> 04:33:27.359 align:start position:0%
we are entering a different era of
 
04:33:27.359 --> 04:33:29.029 align:start position:0%
we are entering a different era of
discrimination

04:33:29.029 --> 04:33:29.039 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
04:33:31.029 --> 04:33:31.039 align:start position:0%
how people are are potentially going to
 
04:33:33.189 --> 04:33:33.199 align:start position:0%
be discriminated against it's not as
 
04:33:35.990 --> 04:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
clear and cut as a person's gender or
 
04:33:38.310 --> 04:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
their color of their skin
 
04:33:41.670 --> 04:33:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:42.949 --> 04:33:42.959 align:start position:0%
areas that we
 
04:33:44.551 --> 04:33:44.561 align:start position:0%
never would have imagined when when
 
04:33:47.910 --> 04:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
initial discrimination laws were written
 
04:33:50.390 --> 04:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
so in order to protect everyone against
 
04:33:52.310 --> 04:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
this type of discrimination it's
 
04:33:53.750 --> 04:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunate that a bill like house bill
 
04:33:56.230 --> 04:33:56.240 align:start position:0%
1469 would even need to be written it
 
04:33:58.470 --> 04:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
protects everyone regardless of your
 
04:34:01.910 --> 04:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
political philosophy regardless of of uh
 
04:34:04.551 --> 04:34:04.561 align:start position:0%
other things that again are being or
 
04:34:07.189 --> 04:34:07.199 align:start position:0%
will be as they are becoming more aware
 
04:34:09.349 --> 04:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
of the types of discrimination so this
 
04:34:10.830 --> 04:34:10.840 align:start position:0%
is truly an
 
04:34:12.949 --> 04:34:12.959 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination bill
 
04:34:14.070 --> 04:34:14.080 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:34:16.390 --> 04:34:16.400 align:start position:0%
just trying to protect businesses
 
04:34:19.189 --> 04:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
protect consumers and individual people
 
04:34:21.670 --> 04:34:21.680 align:start position:0%
alike from this type of discrimination
 
04:34:22.949 --> 04:34:22.959 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:34:22.959 --> 04:34:23.990 align:start position:0%
thank you
question

04:34:23.990 --> 04:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:34:26.551 --> 04:34:26.561 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett thanks mr chair
 
04:34:29.990 --> 04:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
so my question would be then
 
04:34:32.709 --> 04:34:32.719 align:start position:0%
if a an abortion clinic came
 
04:34:32.719 --> 04:34:34.709 align:start position:0%
if a an abortion clinic came
for

04:34:34.709 --> 04:34:34.719 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:34:36.310 --> 04:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
a fund funding
 
04:34:38.470 --> 04:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
then there would be no discrimination
 
04:34:43.750 --> 04:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:47.029 --> 04:34:47.039 align:start position:0%
if an abortion clinic goes to
 
04:34:48.709 --> 04:34:48.719 align:start position:0%
a bank
 
04:34:51.590 --> 04:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
and wants to open an account
 
04:34:52.830 --> 04:34:52.840 align:start position:0%
conduct its
 
04:34:55.510 --> 04:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
transactions they're they they they
 
04:34:55.520 --> 04:34:57.109 align:start position:0%
transactions they're they they they
cannot

04:34:57.109 --> 04:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
cannot
 
04:35:00.310 --> 04:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
discriminate against that based on that
 
04:35:03.109 --> 04:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
political philosophy
 
04:35:04.869 --> 04:35:04.879 align:start position:0%
that would be for any loans for in doing
 
04:35:06.709 --> 04:35:06.719 align:start position:0%
any business
 
04:35:10.551 --> 04:35:10.561 align:start position:0%
that is correct okay thank you
 
04:35:12.789 --> 04:35:12.799 align:start position:0%
any other discussion on the motion of
 
04:35:15.750 --> 04:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on the amendment
 
04:35:17.750 --> 04:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
yes representative could you remind me
 
04:35:20.949 --> 04:35:20.959 align:start position:0%
or remind the committee and the
 
04:35:22.470 --> 04:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
people in the audience how many people
 
04:35:25.349 --> 04:35:25.359 align:start position:0%
signed it signed in in or opposed do you
 
04:35:28.949 --> 04:35:28.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:31.910 --> 04:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh i'm not sure we have the blue sheet
 
04:35:33.910 --> 04:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
here no the folder no no we don't
 
04:35:36.070 --> 04:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
actually have the folder here sorry we
 
04:35:40.230 --> 04:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:40.240 --> 04:35:41.269 align:start position:0%
 
well

04:35:41.269 --> 04:35:41.279 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:35:42.709 --> 04:35:42.719 align:start position:0%
in terms of the amendment or turn the
 
04:35:44.789 --> 04:35:44.799 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
04:35:46.789 --> 04:35:46.799 align:start position:0%
either one yeah i i'm sorry we don't
 
04:35:49.510 --> 04:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
have the folder that you know that
 
04:35:51.029 --> 04:35:51.039 align:start position:0%
because i i think the general public
 
04:35:52.709 --> 04:35:52.719 align:start position:0%
needs to know how many people signed in
 
04:35:56.310 --> 04:35:56.320 align:start position:0%
in or uh for or oppose this bill
 
04:35:59.910 --> 04:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:59.920 --> 04:36:00.869 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:36:00.869 --> 04:36:00.879 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:36:02.869 --> 04:36:02.879 align:start position:0%
uh because we're we are representing
 
04:36:02.879 --> 04:36:07.109 align:start position:0%
uh because we're we are representing
constituents

04:36:07.109 --> 04:36:07.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:08.869 --> 04:36:08.879 align:start position:0%
sorry that's anecdotal we don't have the
 
04:36:11.189 --> 04:36:11.199 align:start position:0%
question is uh when we had the public
 
04:36:11.199 --> 04:36:12.551 align:start position:0%
question is uh when we had the public
hearing

04:36:12.551 --> 04:36:12.561 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
04:36:14.949 --> 04:36:14.959 align:start position:0%
who signed in on the blue sheet for and
 
04:36:18.949 --> 04:36:18.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:20.629 --> 04:36:20.639 align:start position:0%
do you really want to recess and get
 
04:36:21.910 --> 04:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
that number is that really that
 
04:36:21.920 --> 04:36:23.670 align:start position:0%
that number is that really that
important

04:36:23.670 --> 04:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
important
 
04:36:26.470 --> 04:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
well i think it makes a difference
 
04:36:27.750 --> 04:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
really i mean
 
04:36:30.390 --> 04:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
really okay so if there's
 
04:36:32.390 --> 04:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
if there's 50 people opposed
 
04:36:35.670 --> 04:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
and five that are for the bill
 
04:36:37.349 --> 04:36:37.359 align:start position:0%
and we passed the bill what does that
 
04:36:38.789 --> 04:36:38.799 align:start position:0%
say about the constituents that we're
 
04:36:38.799 --> 04:36:40.310 align:start position:0%
say about the constituents that we're
representing

04:36:40.310 --> 04:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
representing
 
04:36:40.320 --> 04:36:41.510 align:start position:0%
representing
so

04:36:41.510 --> 04:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:36:44.629 --> 04:36:44.639 align:start position:0%
my experience with people signing in
 
04:36:46.869 --> 04:36:46.879 align:start position:0%
that there have been some lobbyists
 
04:36:46.879 --> 04:36:47.830 align:start position:0%
that there have been some lobbyists
efforts

04:36:47.830 --> 04:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
efforts
 
04:36:51.109 --> 04:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
to you know get people to send in and
 
04:36:52.789 --> 04:36:52.799 align:start position:0%
you know get online and do that so i
 
04:36:55.429 --> 04:36:55.439 align:start position:0%
mean i i respect anybody's opinion in
 
04:36:57.349 --> 04:36:57.359 align:start position:0%
doing it but at the end of the day we
 
04:36:59.510 --> 04:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
vote on what we think is the right for
 
04:37:01.189 --> 04:37:01.199 align:start position:0%
new hampshire i don't
 
04:37:02.709 --> 04:37:02.719 align:start position:0%
i don't i would never say that i've
 
04:37:02.719 --> 04:37:04.310 align:start position:0%
i don't i would never say that i've
suddenly

04:37:04.310 --> 04:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
suddenly
 
04:37:06.789 --> 04:37:06.799 align:start position:0%
decided that way i feel about a bill is
 
04:37:09.349 --> 04:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
certainly wrong suddenly because i got
 
04:37:11.510 --> 04:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
hundreds and hundreds of emails telling
 
04:37:13.910 --> 04:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
people for me to vote against something
 
04:37:16.310 --> 04:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
that i think is a good idea
 
04:37:18.551 --> 04:37:18.561 align:start position:0%
so i'm not i'm not sure i would ever do
 
04:37:20.551 --> 04:37:20.561 align:start position:0%
that but if you know if you really want
 
04:37:22.150 --> 04:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
to recess are you going are you going to
 
04:37:24.869 --> 04:37:24.879 align:start position:0%
ask this for every bill no no no i just
 
04:37:26.150 --> 04:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
wanted to pose a question because i
 
04:37:28.789 --> 04:37:28.799 align:start position:0%
think okay okay and i think if this mr
 
04:37:30.070 --> 04:37:30.080 align:start position:0%
chair if this is the only bill that we
 
04:37:31.510 --> 04:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
don't have that information for i really
 
04:37:33.189 --> 04:37:33.199 align:start position:0%
do think we should have it okay well
 
04:37:35.109 --> 04:37:35.119 align:start position:0%
we're in recess and we'll go get the
 
04:37:35.119 --> 04:37:54.709 align:start position:0%
we're in recess and we'll go get the
phone

04:37:54.709 --> 04:37:54.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:01.269 --> 04:38:01.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:01.279 --> 04:38:38.390 align:start position:0%

healthcare provider she'll contain a
 
04:51:31.350 --> 04:51:31.360 align:start position:0%
provision that requires the healthcare
 
04:51:34.310 --> 04:51:34.320 align:start position:0%
provider to notify the carrier when the
 
04:51:35.510 --> 04:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
healthcare provider is no longer
 
04:51:37.910 --> 04:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
accepting new patients
 
04:51:40.150 --> 04:51:40.160 align:start position:0%
this still puts the onus on the provider
 
04:51:44.470 --> 04:51:44.480 align:start position:0%
having to tell the the carrier
 
04:51:45.750 --> 04:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
and then coverage for certain

04:55:09.590 --> 04:55:09.600 align:start position:0%
now you got a little taste of what i'm
 
04:55:12.628 --> 04:55:12.638 align:start position:0%
doing here
 
05:07:27.110 --> 05:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:29.270 --> 05:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
we'll open up the public hearing
 
05:07:29.280 --> 05:07:32.190 align:start position:0%
we'll open up the public hearing

05:07:52.230 --> 05:07:52.240 align:start position:0%
you gotta press the button press it
 
05:07:54.070 --> 05:07:54.080 align:start position:0%
and we're told it's completely opposite
 
05:07:55.430 --> 05:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
what is in the courts that's what i was
 
05:07:57.990 --> 05:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
gonna yes yes so for all you lawyers who

trial lawyers this is opposite it's
 
05:08:02.070 --> 05:08:02.080 align:start position:0%
completely different so you see the
 
05:08:05.270 --> 05:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:07.910 --> 05:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
so anyway thank you and um so i'm becky
 
05:08:10.070 --> 05:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
macbeth i
 
05:08:11.350 --> 05:08:11.360 align:start position:0%
was a member of this committee for six
 
05:08:14.150 --> 05:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
wonderful years i'm now in judiciary but
 
05:08:15.510 --> 05:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
i have to say i used to always wonder
 
05:08:17.030 --> 05:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
when members would come in and say you
 
05:08:18.390 --> 05:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
know i used to be here and i didn't
 
05:08:20.150 --> 05:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
recognize them i kind of felt sorry for
 
05:08:22.150 --> 05:08:22.160 align:start position:0%
them and then i also wondered if they
 
05:08:23.910 --> 05:08:23.920 align:start position:0%
were still doing quite as much work as
 
05:08:26.470 --> 05:08:26.480 align:start position:0%
we were so i want to tell you that um i
 
05:08:28.070 --> 05:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
am doing quite a bit of work but maybe
 
05:08:29.270 --> 05:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
not as much
 
05:08:32.230 --> 05:08:32.240 align:start position:0%
um so i'm here today to introduce a bill
 
05:08:34.150 --> 05:08:34.160 align:start position:0%
um that i think was heard all three
 
05:08:36.390 --> 05:08:36.400 align:start position:0%
sessions that i said on this committee
 
05:08:37.830 --> 05:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
it's hb
 
05:08:40.230 --> 05:08:40.240 align:start position:0%
1501 fn
 
05:08:41.670 --> 05:08:41.680 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to try to say this right
 
05:08:43.990 --> 05:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
it's um it's regarding um insurance
 
05:08:46.150 --> 05:08:46.160 align:start position:0%
coverage for pediatric autoimmune
 
05:08:48.470 --> 05:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
neuropsychic disorders
 
05:08:50.708 --> 05:08:50.718 align:start position:0%
um and you probably have heard the um
 
05:08:54.390 --> 05:08:54.400 align:start position:0%
acronym pandas or pans i really don't
 
05:08:55.750 --> 05:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
that is what
 
05:08:57.990 --> 05:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
this is referring to or that but i think
 
05:09:00.868 --> 05:09:00.878 align:start position:0%
that that acronym is kind of getting
 
05:09:03.750 --> 05:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
misused we're finding out more about
 
05:09:03.760 --> 05:09:04.590 align:start position:0%
misused we're finding out more about
these

05:09:04.590 --> 05:09:04.600 align:start position:0%
these
 
05:09:08.708 --> 05:09:08.718 align:start position:0%
neuropsychic autoimmune disorders and
 
05:09:08.718 --> 05:09:09.590 align:start position:0%
neuropsychic autoimmune disorders and
but

05:09:09.590 --> 05:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:09:09.600 --> 05:09:10.868 align:start position:0%
but
about

05:09:10.868 --> 05:09:10.878 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:09:13.750 --> 05:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
three years ago this committee heard
 
05:09:14.868 --> 05:09:14.878 align:start position:0%
had heard
 
05:09:17.350 --> 05:09:17.360 align:start position:0%
testimony from citizens in new hampshire
 
05:09:19.190 --> 05:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
that were having trouble
 
05:09:21.830 --> 05:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
getting insurance companies when their
 
05:09:23.350 --> 05:09:23.360 align:start position:0%
family members had been
 
05:09:24.830 --> 05:09:24.840 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with
 
05:09:27.830 --> 05:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
this coverage from this
 
05:09:31.190 --> 05:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
treatment called it's iv ig
 
05:09:33.590 --> 05:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
but it's intravenous
 
05:09:35.430 --> 05:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
immunoglobulin therapy and i'm so
 
05:09:36.628 --> 05:09:36.638 align:start position:0%
embarrassed that i can't say those i
 
05:09:38.868 --> 05:09:38.878 align:start position:0%
should but that therapy i can't really
 
05:09:40.230 --> 05:09:40.240 align:start position:0%
scientifically describe it to you but
 
05:09:41.830 --> 05:09:41.840 align:start position:0%
it's a lot what the therapy that you get
 
05:09:43.750 --> 05:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
when you've been exposed to rabies it's
 
05:09:45.910 --> 05:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
a blood um
 
05:09:47.750 --> 05:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
product byproduct of other people's
 
05:09:49.110 --> 05:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
blood and you know they depending on
 
05:09:50.470 --> 05:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
your height and weight and what your
 
05:09:52.628 --> 05:09:52.638 align:start position:0%
symptoms are it's got other things mixed
 
05:09:54.150 --> 05:09:54.160 align:start position:0%
in it but it's a very expensive
 
05:09:56.070 --> 05:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
treatment and
 
05:09:57.270 --> 05:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
some of the citizens felt like they
 
05:09:58.628 --> 05:09:58.638 align:start position:0%
weren't getting that
 
05:10:02.150 --> 05:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
approved by insurance companies so
 
05:10:04.470 --> 05:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
about three years ago we added into the
 
05:10:06.230 --> 05:10:06.240 align:start position:0%
committee added into the legislation
 
05:10:07.590 --> 05:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
that it would be covered by new
 
05:10:09.350 --> 05:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire health insurers and that that
 
05:10:12.628 --> 05:10:12.638 align:start position:0%
treatment specifically would be
 
05:10:14.310 --> 05:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
offered or approved if if it was
 
05:10:16.628 --> 05:10:16.638 align:start position:0%
recommended by the provider
 
05:10:19.430 --> 05:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
so i'm here now because the sun sets
 
05:10:20.670 --> 05:10:20.680 align:start position:0%
coming up in
 
05:10:23.430 --> 05:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
2004. and
 
05:10:24.628 --> 05:10:24.638 align:start position:0%
so i don't want to feel like i'm
 
05:10:26.470 --> 05:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
reneging on my deal because i think
 
05:10:28.390 --> 05:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
there was concern at the time that we
 
05:10:30.070 --> 05:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
passed that there might be a run on
 
05:10:31.270 --> 05:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
insurance companies that there would be
 
05:10:34.150 --> 05:10:34.160 align:start position:0%
a huge demand for this or that
 
05:10:35.750 --> 05:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
maybe it wasn't going to be an effective
 
05:10:37.430 --> 05:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
treatment i'm not really sure all the
 
05:10:39.510 --> 05:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
reasons but i think none of that has
 
05:10:42.390 --> 05:10:42.400 align:start position:0%
panned out and i i think that um
 
05:10:43.910 --> 05:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
you're going to hear from the insurers
 
05:10:45.910 --> 05:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
themselves or their representatives but
 
05:10:47.750 --> 05:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
i think this has been you know an
 
05:10:51.350 --> 05:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
effective tool for citizens to use
 
05:10:53.990 --> 05:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
people have been getting treatment
 
05:10:54.000 --> 05:10:55.270 align:start position:0%
people have been getting treatment
and

05:10:55.270 --> 05:10:55.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:10:57.190 --> 05:10:57.200 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's been you know
 
05:10:59.590 --> 05:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
overused by providers
 
05:11:01.910 --> 05:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
as well as you know during this covet
 
05:11:03.990 --> 05:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
time people have put off some of their
 
05:11:05.670 --> 05:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
treatment so
 
05:11:07.510 --> 05:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
there's another issue that i asked for
 
05:11:09.350 --> 05:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
an extension of that so this is kind of
 
05:11:11.990 --> 05:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
a permanent extension but um you know we
 
05:11:13.750 --> 05:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
can hear that out and i i saw that i
 
05:11:15.350 --> 05:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
think the chairman has scheduled it for
 
05:11:18.628 --> 05:11:18.638 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee hearing next week
 
05:11:21.350 --> 05:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
amazing how quickly that happens
 
05:11:23.430 --> 05:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
all right so thank you very much i will
 
05:11:25.030 --> 05:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
take questions but i think probably
 
05:11:26.868 --> 05:11:26.878 align:start position:0%
people behind me might have better
 
05:11:31.110 --> 05:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:33.030 --> 05:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
i guess you're off the oh oh i'm
 
05:11:33.040 --> 05:11:35.590 align:start position:0%
i guess you're off the oh oh i'm
confused

05:11:35.590 --> 05:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
confused
 
05:11:37.270 --> 05:11:37.280 align:start position:0%
representative johnson has
 
05:11:39.750 --> 05:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
her hand up first
 
05:11:41.750 --> 05:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
05:11:44.150 --> 05:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
um i was in another committee
 
05:11:48.788 --> 05:11:48.798 align:start position:0%
and a similar issue was brought up um
 
05:11:51.270 --> 05:11:51.280 align:start position:0%
but what they did was they took us uh 3
 
05:11:53.590 --> 05:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
000 foot view and included you know
 
05:11:53.600 --> 05:11:54.390 align:start position:0%
000 foot view and included you know
other

05:11:54.390 --> 05:11:54.400 align:start position:0%
other
 
05:11:56.070 --> 05:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
disorders and stuff
 
05:11:58.708 --> 05:11:58.718 align:start position:0%
could this be maybe amended to include
 
05:12:01.110 --> 05:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
some other disorders and or treatments
 
05:12:03.350 --> 05:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
that we might see
 
05:12:05.030 --> 05:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
the same thing happening so we're not
 
05:12:07.750 --> 05:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
just targeting one but we're we're
 
05:12:10.708 --> 05:12:10.718 align:start position:0%
expanding it to other pieces that may be
 
05:12:18.470 --> 05:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:19.350 --> 05:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
that would
 
05:12:21.110 --> 05:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
be a question i think for the committee
 
05:12:23.750 --> 05:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
to look into pandas itself
 
05:12:27.270 --> 05:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
is a broad spectrum of
 
05:12:29.990 --> 05:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
conditions and symptoms and it's still
 
05:12:31.670 --> 05:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
you know very i think malleable as far
 
05:12:34.230 --> 05:12:34.240 align:start position:0%
as how it's going to be defined
 
05:12:35.270 --> 05:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
i think if you're talking about some of
 
05:12:36.868 --> 05:12:36.878 align:start position:0%
those or if you're just talking about
 
05:12:36.878 --> 05:12:38.230 align:start position:0%
those or if you're just talking about
other

05:12:38.230 --> 05:12:38.240 align:start position:0%
other
 
05:12:40.868 --> 05:12:40.878 align:start position:0%
issues that you know or diagnosis or
 
05:12:42.150 --> 05:12:42.160 align:start position:0%
that people are having trouble getting
 
05:12:44.788 --> 05:12:44.798 align:start position:0%
coverage for um i i wouldn't comment on
 
05:12:44.798 --> 05:12:47.430 align:start position:0%
coverage for um i i wouldn't comment on
that

05:12:47.430 --> 05:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:48.708 --> 05:12:48.718 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett did you have a
 
05:12:51.750 --> 05:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
question thank you mr chair so um
 
05:12:53.510 --> 05:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
representative macbeth we're glad to
 
05:12:55.270 --> 05:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
have you back we know we worked hard on
 
05:12:58.070 --> 05:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
this for two terms i think it was before
 
05:12:59.830 --> 05:12:59.840 align:start position:0%
we got this through so all you're asking
 
05:13:01.350 --> 05:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
is that the sunset
 
05:13:05.350 --> 05:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
crosby repeal is that what you're asking
 
05:13:07.830 --> 05:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
yes that's what i'm asking um
 
05:13:09.990 --> 05:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
it's very short and it's actually we put
 
05:13:11.750 --> 05:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
in two phrases but it's just the last
 
05:13:13.750 --> 05:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
phrase the the
 
05:13:16.948 --> 05:13:16.958 align:start position:0%
recognizing the pandas disorders as a um
 
05:13:17.910 --> 05:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:13:17.920 --> 05:13:20.550 align:start position:0%
you know
diagnostic

05:13:20.550 --> 05:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
diagnostic
 
05:13:21.670 --> 05:13:21.680 align:start position:0%
what i don't know what it would be
 
05:13:23.350 --> 05:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
diagnostic code or i don't know if
 
05:13:25.590 --> 05:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
there's a code or not but um
 
05:13:28.150 --> 05:13:28.160 align:start position:0%
that would stay it's just this iv ig
 
05:13:29.670 --> 05:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
treatment that
 
05:13:30.788 --> 05:13:30.798 align:start position:0%
we like to
 
05:13:30.798 --> 05:13:31.990 align:start position:0%
we like to
extend

05:13:31.990 --> 05:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
extend
 
05:13:33.350 --> 05:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
can i follow up where's the question you
 
05:13:35.990 --> 05:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
mean claire thank you so um
 
05:13:37.430 --> 05:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
we had this
 
05:13:39.030 --> 05:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
last year
 
05:13:40.868 --> 05:13:40.878 align:start position:0%
didn't we because i think we had the
 
05:13:42.230 --> 05:13:42.240 align:start position:0%
insurance department come in and say
 
05:13:44.550 --> 05:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
that it's been really tough to code this
 
05:13:46.708 --> 05:13:46.718 align:start position:0%
because it is such an unusual
 
05:13:46.718 --> 05:13:48.150 align:start position:0%
because it is such an unusual
condition

05:13:48.150 --> 05:13:48.160 align:start position:0%
condition
 
05:13:48.160 --> 05:13:49.750 align:start position:0%
condition
um

05:13:49.750 --> 05:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:13:52.390 --> 05:13:52.400 align:start position:0%
should i just wait and ask tyler i think
 
05:13:54.948 --> 05:13:54.958 align:start position:0%
actually i think um
 
05:13:56.868 --> 05:13:56.878 align:start position:0%
townie manful who's here might have some
 
05:13:58.310 --> 05:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
and i know that tyler's here to give a
 
05:13:59.990 --> 05:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
history but i'm glad that you mentioned
 
05:14:01.670 --> 05:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
that as well because one of the reasons
 
05:14:03.830 --> 05:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
why i'd like to extend the deadline is
 
05:14:03.840 --> 05:14:04.788 align:start position:0%
why i'd like to extend the deadline is
because

05:14:04.788 --> 05:14:04.798 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:14:06.550 --> 05:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
i and i had filed a bill before about
 
05:14:08.070 --> 05:14:08.080 align:start position:0%
trying to collect data it's been really
 
05:14:09.750 --> 05:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
hard to collect data i didn't realize
 
05:14:11.990 --> 05:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
how hard it was or how much time
 
05:14:13.830 --> 05:14:13.840 align:start position:0%
probably too much time then that you
 
05:14:15.430 --> 05:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
know we want as legislators for the
 
05:14:17.750 --> 05:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
department of um insurance to put in on
 
05:14:19.990 --> 05:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
it so what the trade-off for that is
 
05:14:22.070 --> 05:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
since we can't get the data to let it go
 
05:14:23.910 --> 05:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
longer so maybe that data will trickle
 
05:14:25.590 --> 05:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
down or you know we can get something
 
05:14:26.550 --> 05:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
that's more
 
05:14:28.868 --> 05:14:28.878 align:start position:0%
you know usable to educate the
 
05:14:30.948 --> 05:14:30.958 align:start position:0%
legislators about it you know is this
 
05:14:34.948 --> 05:14:34.958 align:start position:0%
working and do we want to keep it
 
05:14:34.958 --> 05:14:35.830 align:start position:0%
working and do we want to keep it
yeah

05:14:35.830 --> 05:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:14:37.590 --> 05:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
read the fiscal note the little
 
05:14:40.230 --> 05:14:40.240 align:start position:0%
paragraph there that's it's helpful to
 
05:14:43.190 --> 05:14:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:45.510 --> 05:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you
 
05:14:48.948 --> 05:14:48.958 align:start position:0%
uh and one card tyler
 
05:14:51.750 --> 05:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:56.708 --> 05:14:56.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:58.868 --> 05:14:58.878 align:start position:0%
okay so tyler brennan life and health
 
05:14:59.990 --> 05:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
director with the new hampshire
 
05:15:02.390 --> 05:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
insurance department we do not have a
 
05:15:04.550 --> 05:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
position on the bill and
 
05:15:06.390 --> 05:15:06.400 align:start position:0%
agree it is about repealing the sunset
 
05:15:09.670 --> 05:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:11.510 --> 05:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
this is a little bit of an unusual
 
05:15:13.190 --> 05:15:13.200 align:start position:0%
mandate so
 
05:15:15.590 --> 05:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
when insurance coverage is provided it's
 
05:15:18.230 --> 05:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
provided on the basis of scopus services
 
05:15:20.150 --> 05:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
so think hospital services think
 
05:15:22.150 --> 05:15:22.160 align:start position:0%
ambulance services think surgery they're
 
05:15:23.510 --> 05:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
in collaboratory
 
05:15:25.350 --> 05:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
if a carrier were to decide well we're
 
05:15:26.628 --> 05:15:26.638 align:start position:0%
not going to cover
 
05:15:28.390 --> 05:15:28.400 align:start position:0%
care for diabetics
 
05:15:30.070 --> 05:15:30.080 align:start position:0%
we're not going to cover care for people
 
05:15:31.110 --> 05:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
with a particular mental health
 
05:15:32.788 --> 05:15:32.798 align:start position:0%
condition we would consider that
 
05:15:34.550 --> 05:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
discriminatory and that would be a
 
05:15:37.030 --> 05:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
prohibited practice what's unusual about
 
05:15:38.948 --> 05:15:38.958 align:start position:0%
pandas is that there's some disagreement
 
05:15:40.390 --> 05:15:40.400 align:start position:0%
in the medical community about the
 
05:15:41.990 --> 05:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
condition and how it should be best
 
05:15:44.310 --> 05:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
treated so typically if there is a
 
05:15:46.230 --> 05:15:46.240 align:start position:0%
determination by an insurance carrier
 
05:15:47.910 --> 05:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
that treatment is not medically
 
05:15:50.070 --> 05:15:50.080 align:start position:0%
necessary for the condition there's kind
 
05:15:51.750 --> 05:15:51.760 align:start position:0%
of an appeals process including an
 
05:15:53.670 --> 05:15:53.680 align:start position:0%
external appeals process that would go
 
05:15:55.430 --> 05:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
to clinicians and they would decide
 
05:15:56.708 --> 05:15:56.718 align:start position:0%
whether or not treatment is medically
 
05:15:59.190 --> 05:15:59.200 align:start position:0%
necessary i think the reason that this
 
05:16:01.430 --> 05:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
this mandate passed and the way it did
 
05:16:02.948 --> 05:16:02.958 align:start position:0%
is because there wasn't enough
 
05:16:04.788 --> 05:16:04.798 align:start position:0%
confidence in that appeals process to
 
05:16:07.030 --> 05:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
get to a place where coverage would be
 
05:16:09.190 --> 05:16:09.200 align:start position:0%
provided consistently
 
05:16:11.190 --> 05:16:11.200 align:start position:0%
because it's a condition that's a little
 
05:16:14.070 --> 05:16:14.080 align:start position:0%
less specific a little bit um
 
05:16:16.230 --> 05:16:16.240 align:start position:0%
more vague within the medical community
 
05:16:18.230 --> 05:16:18.240 align:start position:0%
the diagnosis code in other words the
 
05:16:19.590 --> 05:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
code that gets submitted on the claim
 
05:16:21.110 --> 05:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
form describing the condition that
 
05:16:24.150 --> 05:16:24.160 align:start position:0%
somebody has is actually a general code
 
05:16:25.990 --> 05:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
it's described as other specified
 
05:16:28.150 --> 05:16:28.160 align:start position:0%
disorders involving the immune mechanism
 
05:16:30.550 --> 05:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
not elsewhere classified one of the
 
05:16:32.788 --> 05:16:32.798 align:start position:0%
questions we had about a year ago was
 
05:16:35.510 --> 05:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
well how many patients are showing up
 
05:16:37.750 --> 05:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
in insurers coverage how many patients
 
05:16:39.430 --> 05:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
are showing up in the claims data that
 
05:16:41.830 --> 05:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
we have collected in an anonymous way
 
05:16:44.150 --> 05:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
and how much are those patients costing
 
05:16:46.390 --> 05:16:46.400 align:start position:0%
well we all agree that this code is
 
05:16:48.070 --> 05:16:48.080 align:start position:0%
probably not going to be the best it may
 
05:16:49.670 --> 05:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
bring in other patients but let's
 
05:16:51.430 --> 05:16:51.440 align:start position:0%
explore to figure out whether or not
 
05:16:53.430 --> 05:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
it's at all reliable and whether or not
 
05:16:54.868 --> 05:16:54.878 align:start position:0%
there was an increase in the number of
 
05:16:56.470 --> 05:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
people who recovered after the
 
05:16:58.550 --> 05:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
legislation passed including the the
 
05:17:01.030 --> 05:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
mandate and we did the analysis and we
 
05:17:02.470 --> 05:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
quickly determined the code was not
 
05:17:04.070 --> 05:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
going to be reliable there were a lot of
 
05:17:06.550 --> 05:17:06.560 align:start position:0%
adults under that diagnosis code so
 
05:17:08.788 --> 05:17:08.798 align:start position:0%
really just a lot of false positives the
 
05:17:10.550 --> 05:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
legislation that was considered about a
 
05:17:12.470 --> 05:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
year ago actually would look at kind of
 
05:17:14.230 --> 05:17:14.240 align:start position:0%
a reporting requirement for insurance
 
05:17:15.750 --> 05:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
companies to report to the insurance
 
05:17:15.760 --> 05:17:16.788 align:start position:0%
companies to report to the insurance
department

05:17:16.788 --> 05:17:16.798 align:start position:0%
department
 
05:17:17.990 --> 05:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
because they're going to be in the same
 
05:17:19.430 --> 05:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
place the same problem they're not going
 
05:17:21.430 --> 05:17:21.440 align:start position:0%
to identify in the claims data they
 
05:17:23.030 --> 05:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
would have to do something like prior
 
05:17:24.788 --> 05:17:24.798 align:start position:0%
authorization or some sort of case
 
05:17:26.550 --> 05:17:26.560 align:start position:0%
management to identify the patients keep
 
05:17:28.628 --> 05:17:28.638 align:start position:0%
track of the information report the cost
 
05:17:30.948 --> 05:17:30.958 align:start position:0%
to us so any type of retrospective
 
05:17:32.470 --> 05:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
reporting really wouldn't work very well
 
05:17:33.590 --> 05:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
you'd have to kind of set it up
 
05:17:35.830 --> 05:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
prospectively and that ended up sort of
 
05:17:38.390 --> 05:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
not actually moving forward so the place
 
05:17:40.470 --> 05:17:40.480 align:start position:0%
we are today is is again i mean kind of
 
05:17:42.628 --> 05:17:42.638 align:start position:0%
evaluating on a long-term basis whether
 
05:17:44.230 --> 05:17:44.240 align:start position:0%
or not a mandate that is targeting a
 
05:17:46.150 --> 05:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
specific condition
 
05:17:48.070 --> 05:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
is something that you want to do and i
 
05:17:49.670 --> 05:17:49.680 align:start position:0%
think actually the question that was
 
05:17:51.750 --> 05:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
raised is a good one because once you
 
05:17:53.430 --> 05:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
start to go down that road about trying
 
05:17:55.270 --> 05:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
to identify all the conditions you
 
05:17:57.270 --> 05:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
expect insurance to coverage
 
05:17:59.030 --> 05:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
that potentially raises questions about
 
05:18:00.788 --> 05:18:00.798 align:start position:0%
what if anything that's not included i
 
05:18:02.470 --> 05:18:02.480 align:start position:0%
mean we've always looked at it from
 
05:18:03.750 --> 05:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
anything that's excluded is
 
05:18:05.430 --> 05:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
discriminatory but if you came up with a
 
05:18:06.788 --> 05:18:06.798 align:start position:0%
robust enough list it's kind of like
 
05:18:08.150 --> 05:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
well wait a minute how are we going
 
05:18:10.708 --> 05:18:10.718 align:start position:0%
about this so that's a kind of a word of
 
05:18:12.550 --> 05:18:12.560 align:start position:0%
caution and to the extent that the
 
05:18:15.670 --> 05:18:15.680 align:start position:0%
condition the treatment evolve over time
 
05:18:17.510 --> 05:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
it's rare our statutes keep up with
 
05:18:19.190 --> 05:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
those changes so it's just sort of
 
05:18:21.110 --> 05:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
another area of caution i mean typically
 
05:18:23.110 --> 05:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
if you want kind of a mandate scope of
 
05:18:24.708 --> 05:18:24.718 align:start position:0%
services work pretty well but again if
 
05:18:26.708 --> 05:18:26.718 align:start position:0%
they're too specific
 
05:18:28.390 --> 05:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
the practice of medicine can change and
 
05:18:30.550 --> 05:18:30.560 align:start position:0%
you may need to adjust it that being
 
05:18:32.230 --> 05:18:32.240 align:start position:0%
said there's this is clearly a very
 
05:18:33.830 --> 05:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
emotional subject for a lot of people
 
05:18:35.590 --> 05:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
and there appears to have been problems
 
05:18:37.030 --> 05:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
with people getting coverage and
 
05:18:38.948 --> 05:18:38.958 align:start position:0%
treatment for it we heard that during
 
05:18:41.110 --> 05:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
testimony over the years the insurance
 
05:18:42.868 --> 05:18:42.878 align:start position:0%
department has not received complaints
 
05:18:44.868 --> 05:18:44.878 align:start position:0%
about coverage on it the only thing i'm
 
05:18:47.030 --> 05:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
aware of is we heard from a physician at
 
05:18:49.270 --> 05:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
one of the hospitals dartmouth who was
 
05:18:50.628 --> 05:18:50.638 align:start position:0%
raising questions about whether or not
 
05:18:53.110 --> 05:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
mcos were covering it and we had to
 
05:18:54.788 --> 05:18:54.798 align:start position:0%
explain that no that the mandate
 
05:18:56.230 --> 05:18:56.240 align:start position:0%
requirement is for commercial insurance
 
05:18:59.510 --> 05:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't apply to the medicaid mcos
 
05:19:01.750 --> 05:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
so that's that's i guess that's as much
 
05:19:03.830 --> 05:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
as i can offer you in terms of insight
 
05:19:09.030 --> 05:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:11.190 --> 05:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
would there be any way to improve the
 
05:19:14.628 --> 05:19:14.638 align:start position:0%
language or because i i think i i'm
 
05:19:17.350 --> 05:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
i'm sure this sunset was put in for a
 
05:19:17.360 --> 05:19:19.030 align:start position:0%
i'm sure this sunset was put in for a
reason

05:19:19.030 --> 05:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
reason
 
05:19:21.910 --> 05:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
to say that if we don't really get
 
05:19:24.628 --> 05:19:24.638 align:start position:0%
viable information then probably best
 
05:19:26.150 --> 05:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
just let it go
 
05:19:28.628 --> 05:19:28.638 align:start position:0%
so how do you feel any way we can make
 
05:19:30.868 --> 05:19:30.878 align:start position:0%
this work better or should we just let
 
05:19:32.708 --> 05:19:32.718 align:start position:0%
it sunset
 
05:19:34.868 --> 05:19:34.878 align:start position:0%
um that's certainly a policy decision i
 
05:19:36.470 --> 05:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
haven't heard any complaints about the
 
05:19:38.948 --> 05:19:38.958 align:start position:0%
way it's described in terms of coverage
 
05:19:40.390 --> 05:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
and again because we haven't received
 
05:19:41.990 --> 05:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
complaints about people not getting
 
05:19:44.390 --> 05:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
coverage or being interpreted
 
05:19:46.230 --> 05:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
in a way that's not beneficial i'm not
 
05:19:47.750 --> 05:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
sure it could offer improvements i think
 
05:19:49.590 --> 05:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
that it's it is a policy decision
 
05:19:51.110 --> 05:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
whether or not you want to keep this on
 
05:19:54.070 --> 05:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
the books indefinitely or or maintain a
 
05:19:55.750 --> 05:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
sunset date that may be more sensitive
 
05:19:55.760 --> 05:19:56.390 align:start position:0%
sunset date that may be more sensitive
to

05:19:56.390 --> 05:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:19:58.550 --> 05:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
changes over time or
 
05:20:00.150 --> 05:20:00.160 align:start position:0%
different feelings about including
 
05:20:02.070 --> 05:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
specific conditions and treatment in
 
05:20:02.080 --> 05:20:04.470 align:start position:0%
specific conditions and treatment in
statute

05:20:04.470 --> 05:20:04.480 align:start position:0%
statute
 
05:20:06.470 --> 05:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett um thanks mr
 
05:20:08.868 --> 05:20:08.878 align:start position:0%
chair so i'm wondering um there was only
 
05:20:10.628 --> 05:20:10.638 align:start position:0%
one pink card because i'd sure like to
 
05:20:13.430 --> 05:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
hear from the insurance carriers
 
05:20:16.868 --> 05:20:16.878 align:start position:0%
about whether they've been covering this
 
05:20:16.878 --> 05:20:17.990 align:start position:0%
about whether they've been covering this
expensive

05:20:17.990 --> 05:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
expensive
 
05:20:19.910 --> 05:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
i'd love i'd love to hear from
 
05:20:23.510 --> 05:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
from anthem or harvard pilgrim or um
 
05:20:25.590 --> 05:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
travelers you know if if you're actually
 
05:20:28.070 --> 05:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
covering this because it's it must come
 
05:20:29.590 --> 05:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
out in your reports
 
05:20:31.510 --> 05:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
so i can i can tell you that the
 
05:20:34.070 --> 05:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
diagnosis code that they would use when
 
05:20:35.830 --> 05:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
these patients are being treated are
 
05:20:37.590 --> 05:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
being that is being submitted by
 
05:20:39.430 --> 05:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
providers and it is being paid for by
 
05:20:41.830 --> 05:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
insurance companies i just don't i can't
 
05:20:43.910 --> 05:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
tell because adults are in there how
 
05:20:46.548 --> 05:20:46.558 align:start position:0%
many of those patients are for pandas
 
05:20:46.558 --> 05:20:47.590 align:start position:0%
many of those patients are for pandas
right

05:20:47.590 --> 05:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:20:49.350 --> 05:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
but can you tell whether they're doing
 
05:20:51.350 --> 05:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
it because we passed the statue or
 
05:20:52.868 --> 05:20:52.878 align:start position:0%
whether they would have been covering it
 
05:20:52.878 --> 05:20:54.310 align:start position:0%
whether they would have been covering it
anyways

05:20:54.310 --> 05:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
anyways
 
05:20:56.548 --> 05:20:56.558 align:start position:0%
so there aren't a lot of patients in
 
05:20:58.310 --> 05:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
general there did not appear to be an
 
05:21:02.070 --> 05:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
increase after the legislation passed so
 
05:21:03.350 --> 05:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
it's possible that it would have been a
 
05:21:05.430 --> 05:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
reduction had the legislation not passed
 
05:21:07.590 --> 05:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
but um you know there's no way we could
 
05:21:10.788 --> 05:21:10.798 align:start position:0%
look like any change okay yeah
 
05:21:10.798 --> 05:21:12.230 align:start position:0%
look like any change okay yeah
okay

05:21:12.230 --> 05:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:21:14.628 --> 05:21:14.638 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
05:21:17.830 --> 05:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:19.670 --> 05:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
did you do do you sign the blue sheet on
 
05:21:22.390 --> 05:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
this at all or
 
05:21:22.400 --> 05:21:25.350 align:start position:0%
this at all or
okay

05:21:25.350 --> 05:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:28.868 --> 05:21:28.878 align:start position:0%
so um i i guess from the anthem point of
 
05:21:31.670 --> 05:21:31.680 align:start position:0%
view we're well aware of pandas we were
 
05:21:33.430 --> 05:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
part of the discussion with
 
05:21:35.830 --> 05:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
representative macbeth and a number of
 
05:21:37.750 --> 05:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
uh families that were here and testified
 
05:21:39.430 --> 05:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
before the committee
 
05:21:40.948 --> 05:21:40.958 align:start position:0%
and the
 
05:21:42.868 --> 05:21:42.878 align:start position:0%
provision has been in place now probably
 
05:21:45.750 --> 05:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
get a little closer to your mic so our
 
05:21:49.670 --> 05:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
ocr can pick you up okay so um the
 
05:21:52.628 --> 05:21:52.638 align:start position:0%
provision's been in place for some time
 
05:21:55.350 --> 05:21:55.360 align:start position:0%
i think beyond the data challenges that
 
05:21:57.990 --> 05:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
tyler brannon pointed out
 
05:22:00.628 --> 05:22:00.638 align:start position:0%
one good place to look would be to
 
05:22:04.070 --> 05:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
internally and each insurer go to your
 
05:22:06.150 --> 05:22:06.160 align:start position:0%
people that handle customer service and
 
05:22:08.390 --> 05:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
complaints and appeals and grievances
 
05:22:10.230 --> 05:22:10.240 align:start position:0%
and ask them whether they've had
 
05:22:12.628 --> 05:22:12.638 align:start position:0%
anything at all that would point out
 
05:22:16.230 --> 05:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
that pandas has become an issue i.e that
 
05:22:18.548 --> 05:22:18.558 align:start position:0%
parents are not seeing that insurance
 
05:22:20.948 --> 05:22:20.958 align:start position:0%
company is responding appropriately we
 
05:22:22.548 --> 05:22:22.558 align:start position:0%
have no
 
05:22:25.270 --> 05:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
knowledge of such complaint
 
05:22:27.910 --> 05:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
and one thing i think will give you
 
05:22:30.868 --> 05:22:30.878 align:start position:0%
maybe a little bit of pause is the fact
 
05:22:34.150 --> 05:22:34.160 align:start position:0%
that the treatments for this condition
 
05:22:36.708 --> 05:22:36.718 align:start position:0%
are somewhat in dispute
 
05:22:40.070 --> 05:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
so i think all physicians pediatricians
 
05:22:40.080 --> 05:22:41.190 align:start position:0%
so i think all physicians pediatricians
mostly

05:22:41.190 --> 05:22:41.200 align:start position:0%
mostly
 
05:22:43.350 --> 05:22:43.360 align:start position:0%
or behavioral health specialists in
 
05:22:45.750 --> 05:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
collaborative care with a pediatrician
 
05:22:48.788 --> 05:22:48.798 align:start position:0%
seeing a child in some distress
 
05:22:51.110 --> 05:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
may not be able to come to a pandas
 
05:22:53.510 --> 05:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
diagnosis or may come to one but if they
 
05:22:55.190 --> 05:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
come to one and they go to a
 
05:22:58.310 --> 05:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
practitioner a pediatrician they're apt
 
05:23:01.430 --> 05:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
to get a number of treatments before
 
05:23:01.440 --> 05:23:03.030 align:start position:0%
to get a number of treatments before
ivig

05:23:03.030 --> 05:23:03.040 align:start position:0%
ivig
 
05:23:05.030 --> 05:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
the immunoglobulin
 
05:23:06.708 --> 05:23:06.718 align:start position:0%
treatment that representative macbeth
 
05:23:08.070 --> 05:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
referred to
 
05:23:10.310 --> 05:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
that is really the purpose of this
 
05:23:12.788 --> 05:23:12.798 align:start position:0%
mandate in new hampshire is to make that
 
05:23:14.470 --> 05:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
treatment available
 
05:23:16.868 --> 05:23:16.878 align:start position:0%
and when that was proposed
 
05:23:18.708 --> 05:23:18.718 align:start position:0%
i can't remember exactly who testified
 
05:23:21.270 --> 05:23:21.280 align:start position:0%
but i know what anthem was reluctant to
 
05:23:23.750 --> 05:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
have that put into statute because there
 
05:23:25.830 --> 05:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
was clinical disagreement out in the
 
05:23:28.230 --> 05:23:28.240 align:start position:0%
ether amongst those people that debate
 
05:23:31.030 --> 05:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
about these things as to whether ivig
 
05:23:33.670 --> 05:23:33.680 align:start position:0%
was indeed a good or appropriate
 
05:23:33.680 --> 05:23:35.910 align:start position:0%
was indeed a good or appropriate
treatment

05:23:35.910 --> 05:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
05:23:39.030 --> 05:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
i remember giving testimony about
 
05:23:40.628 --> 05:23:40.638 align:start position:0%
i think it was the american academy of
 
05:23:43.830 --> 05:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
pediatricians had looked at that issue
 
05:23:46.230 --> 05:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
and had wanted to back away from an
 
05:23:49.590 --> 05:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
initial embrace of ivig
 
05:23:51.190 --> 05:23:51.200 align:start position:0%
there was one other treatment it was
 
05:23:53.510 --> 05:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
called apheresis a
 
05:23:55.990 --> 05:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
e a-p-h-e-r-s-i-s i think
 
05:23:58.708 --> 05:23:58.718 align:start position:0%
and that is where the individual's blood
 
05:24:00.470 --> 05:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
would actually be
 
05:24:00.480 --> 05:24:01.830 align:start position:0%
would actually be
threatened

05:24:01.830 --> 05:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
threatened
 
05:24:03.510 --> 05:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
sent through some sort of a
 
05:24:05.830 --> 05:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
cleansing mechanism which was another
 
05:24:08.788 --> 05:24:08.798 align:start position:0%
treatment which was more as as you know
 
05:24:09.910 --> 05:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
it's sort of a
 
05:24:13.190 --> 05:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
substantial treatment as ivig is
 
05:24:15.670 --> 05:24:15.680 align:start position:0%
my guess is that there aren't many
 
05:24:17.350 --> 05:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
pediatricians that are going to come up
 
05:24:19.590 --> 05:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
with a patient that has an advanced
 
05:24:22.470 --> 05:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
situation that would even give them the
 
05:24:24.628 --> 05:24:24.638 align:start position:0%
thought of ivig because they would go
 
05:24:26.548 --> 05:24:26.558 align:start position:0%
through protocols around
 
05:24:28.470 --> 05:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
antibiotic treatment
 
05:24:30.708 --> 05:24:30.718 align:start position:0%
steroids treatment
 
05:24:32.628 --> 05:24:32.638 align:start position:0%
maybe behavioral modification and
 
05:24:32.638 --> 05:24:34.948 align:start position:0%
maybe behavioral modification and
behavioral

05:24:34.948 --> 05:24:34.958 align:start position:0%
behavioral
 
05:24:34.958 --> 05:24:36.390 align:start position:0%
behavioral
modification

05:24:36.390 --> 05:24:36.400 align:start position:0%
modification
 
05:24:38.868 --> 05:24:38.878 align:start position:0%
training with a child who's evidencing
 
05:24:41.030 --> 05:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
you know psychiatric and behavioral
 
05:24:43.110 --> 05:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
mechanisms that are alarming
 
05:24:45.190 --> 05:24:45.200 align:start position:0%
so i just you know i'm not so sure the
 
05:24:47.750 --> 05:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
demand is out there in new hampshire but
 
05:24:49.670 --> 05:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
if it's been out there we at anthem are
 
05:24:50.868 --> 05:24:50.878 align:start position:0%
not aware
 
05:24:52.708 --> 05:24:52.718 align:start position:0%
that we have denied it and we certainly
 
05:24:54.390 --> 05:24:54.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it's under state law if a
 
05:24:56.150 --> 05:24:56.160 align:start position:0%
physician says that's the treatment they
 
05:24:58.070 --> 05:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
want then that's the treatment they're
 
05:25:01.030 --> 05:25:01.040 align:start position:0%
going to get in new hampshire
 
05:25:03.430 --> 05:25:03.440 align:start position:0%
and so that's where it is now and again
 
05:25:05.830 --> 05:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
as tyler said there's a puzzlement and
 
05:25:07.830 --> 05:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
as representative mcbeath said there's
 
05:25:10.310 --> 05:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
this continuing concern about this
 
05:25:12.390 --> 05:25:12.400 align:start position:0%
challenging issue and as you said
 
05:25:13.670 --> 05:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
representative hunt there are many
 
05:25:15.750 --> 05:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
families that are very distressed about
 
05:25:17.270 --> 05:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
the fact that their child may have this
 
05:25:18.868 --> 05:25:18.878 align:start position:0%
condition which doesn't have any easy
 
05:25:18.878 --> 05:25:20.868 align:start position:0%
condition which doesn't have any easy
answers

05:25:20.868 --> 05:25:20.878 align:start position:0%
answers
 
05:25:23.270 --> 05:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
but anthem is neutral on this that's
 
05:25:26.628 --> 05:25:26.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:29.350 --> 05:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you
 
05:25:31.110 --> 05:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
i do have another card
 
05:25:35.590 --> 05:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:36.948 --> 05:25:36.958 align:start position:0%
support of the bill
 
05:25:40.470 --> 05:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:44.390 --> 05:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
i'm here really on behalf of our family
 
05:25:47.590 --> 05:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
some of you may recognize me from
 
05:25:50.230 --> 05:25:50.240 align:start position:0%
the original sb224
 
05:25:52.470 --> 05:25:52.480 align:start position:0%
but we lost our daughter
 
05:25:55.030 --> 05:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
alexandra at 26 years old to
 
05:25:58.070 --> 05:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
complications related to pandas
 
05:26:01.430 --> 05:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
and we feel as parents that
 
05:26:03.990 --> 05:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
had we known more about this condition
 
05:26:05.430 --> 05:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
and more importantly had the medical
 
05:26:07.350 --> 05:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
community had known more we probably
 
05:26:10.150 --> 05:26:10.160 align:start position:0%
would still have our daughter
 
05:26:12.708 --> 05:26:12.718 align:start position:0%
since then my wife and i have been very
 
05:26:12.718 --> 05:26:14.548 align:start position:0%
since then my wife and i have been very
uh

05:26:14.548 --> 05:26:14.558 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:26:16.310 --> 05:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
actively trying to
 
05:26:19.670 --> 05:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
promote awareness of pandas education
 
05:26:21.990 --> 05:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
and even supportive research
 
05:26:23.990 --> 05:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
but as was discussed here
 
05:26:26.070 --> 05:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
there's still some unknowns that we're
 
05:26:27.670 --> 05:26:27.680 align:start position:0%
trying to to
 
05:26:29.190 --> 05:26:29.200 align:start position:0%
get answers to
 
05:26:31.830 --> 05:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
but one of the things we do know
 
05:26:33.830 --> 05:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
is that some of the treatments are
 
05:26:36.390 --> 05:26:36.400 align:start position:0%
working for those more
 
05:26:38.628 --> 05:26:38.638 align:start position:0%
serious cases and ivig is one of those
 
05:26:40.470 --> 05:26:40.480 align:start position:0%
treatments that does work
 
05:26:43.110 --> 05:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
if you're
 
05:26:44.948 --> 05:26:44.958 align:start position:0%
if you're a patient then you reach a
 
05:26:46.708 --> 05:26:46.718 align:start position:0%
chronic stage
 
05:26:50.628 --> 05:26:50.638 align:start position:0%
so i'm really here to say i think
 
05:26:53.510 --> 05:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
um i'm in supportive of removing the
 
05:26:55.190 --> 05:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
sunset claws and i think there's a
 
05:26:56.868 --> 05:26:56.878 align:start position:0%
couple of
 
05:26:59.750 --> 05:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
developments that may help in this
 
05:26:59.760 --> 05:27:01.030 align:start position:0%
developments that may help in this
decision

05:27:01.030 --> 05:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
decision
 
05:27:03.990 --> 05:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
one is as was alluded to the the coding
 
05:27:06.708 --> 05:27:06.718 align:start position:0%
of pandas made it very hard to
 
05:27:09.350 --> 05:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
actually look at data and have an
 
05:27:11.110 --> 05:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
informed decision about how well is a
 
05:27:12.788 --> 05:27:12.798 align:start position:0%
bill working
 
05:27:15.350 --> 05:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
i can tell you anecdotally in talking to
 
05:27:17.670 --> 05:27:17.680 align:start position:0%
other parents it has made a difference
 
05:27:18.628 --> 05:27:18.638 align:start position:0%
if you're
 
05:27:19.830 --> 05:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
if you have
 
05:27:22.548 --> 05:27:22.558 align:start position:0%
a child with pandas in new hampshire
 
05:27:24.788 --> 05:27:24.798 align:start position:0%
with the new hampshire insurance company
 
05:27:26.548 --> 05:27:26.558 align:start position:0%
it has made a difference and that's a
 
05:27:26.558 --> 05:27:27.670 align:start position:0%
it has made a difference and that's a
positive

05:27:27.670 --> 05:27:27.680 align:start position:0%
positive
 
05:27:30.230 --> 05:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
the challenge with the coding is that
 
05:27:33.030 --> 05:27:33.040 align:start position:0%
until recently there was no specific
 
05:27:34.868 --> 05:27:34.878 align:start position:0%
code for pandas
 
05:27:38.070 --> 05:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
what recently has happened is the icd
 
05:27:38.080 --> 05:27:39.270 align:start position:0%
what recently has happened is the icd
codes

05:27:39.270 --> 05:27:39.280 align:start position:0%
codes
 
05:27:42.070 --> 05:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
starting in october were made available
 
05:27:44.708 --> 05:27:44.718 align:start position:0%
for pandas and i believe in
 
05:27:47.990 --> 05:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
in approximately five years icd-12
 
05:27:50.708 --> 05:27:50.718 align:start position:0%
will have a specific code for pandas but
 
05:27:53.750 --> 05:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
as of today physicians can submit a
 
05:27:53.760 --> 05:27:55.430 align:start position:0%
as of today physicians can submit a
diagnosis

05:27:55.430 --> 05:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
diagnosis
 
05:27:55.440 --> 05:27:56.350 align:start position:0%
diagnosis
under

05:27:56.350 --> 05:27:56.360 align:start position:0%
under
 
05:27:56.360 --> 05:27:58.070 align:start position:0%
under
icd-8989

05:27:58.070 --> 05:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
icd-8989
 
05:28:00.390 --> 05:28:00.400 align:start position:0%
which will help us in gathering data in
 
05:28:02.470 --> 05:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
terms of how effective
 
05:28:04.788 --> 05:28:04.798 align:start position:0%
and and and quantify what the problem is
 
05:28:07.510 --> 05:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
and that helps people like my wife and i
 
05:28:09.270 --> 05:28:09.280 align:start position:0%
to get the word out there and and to
 
05:28:10.948 --> 05:28:10.958 align:start position:0%
inform the public
 
05:28:13.590 --> 05:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
and to support families not just in new
 
05:28:14.868 --> 05:28:14.878 align:start position:0%
hampshire but
 
05:28:14.878 --> 05:28:15.750 align:start position:0%
hampshire but
throughout

05:28:15.750 --> 05:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
throughout
 
05:28:17.430 --> 05:28:17.440 align:start position:0%
the country
 
05:28:17.440 --> 05:28:18.230 align:start position:0%
the country
so

05:28:18.230 --> 05:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:28:20.390 --> 05:28:20.400 align:start position:0%
i think if anything the reason
 
05:28:22.548 --> 05:28:22.558 align:start position:0%
one argument may be
 
05:28:22.558 --> 05:28:23.910 align:start position:0%
one argument may be
that

05:28:23.910 --> 05:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:28:26.548 --> 05:28:26.558 align:start position:0%
the data the ability to really look at
 
05:28:29.030 --> 05:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
the data was probably delayed a bit from
 
05:28:31.350 --> 05:28:31.360 align:start position:0%
when we first passed the bill but now
 
05:28:33.590 --> 05:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
we're coming in with more research and
 
05:28:35.750 --> 05:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
we have some diagnostic codes that allow
 
05:28:36.788 --> 05:28:36.798 align:start position:0%
us to
 
05:28:38.150 --> 05:28:38.160 align:start position:0%
collect information from the insurance
 
05:28:39.750 --> 05:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
companies i think we're at a more
 
05:28:41.110 --> 05:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
meaningful point
 
05:28:44.310 --> 05:28:44.320 align:start position:0%
and i fear that we'll run out of time to
 
05:28:46.230 --> 05:28:46.240 align:start position:0%
really be able to properly evaluate the
 
05:28:48.390 --> 05:28:48.400 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of the bill
 
05:28:50.230 --> 05:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
so that would be one point the other
 
05:28:52.390 --> 05:28:52.400 align:start position:0%
point is that ivig
 
05:28:54.708 --> 05:28:54.718 align:start position:0%
is is a very costly
 
05:28:56.708 --> 05:28:56.718 align:start position:0%
but very critical
 
05:28:59.510 --> 05:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
treatment for the most chronic cases but
 
05:29:02.948 --> 05:29:02.958 align:start position:0%
the cost of it is beyond what a family
 
05:29:05.670 --> 05:29:05.680 align:start position:0%
can really endure without serious
 
05:29:05.680 --> 05:29:07.430 align:start position:0%
can really endure without serious
sacrifice

05:29:07.430 --> 05:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
sacrifice
 
05:29:10.230 --> 05:29:10.240 align:start position:0%
and the research on ivag there's just
 
05:29:13.190 --> 05:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
one that came out in italy recently but
 
05:29:15.430 --> 05:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
there's actually a quite a large
 
05:29:17.750 --> 05:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
state street clinical trial that's now
 
05:29:17.760 --> 05:29:19.910 align:start position:0%
state street clinical trial that's now
underway

05:29:19.910 --> 05:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
underway
 
05:29:22.788 --> 05:29:22.798 align:start position:0%
through octafarma who's a manufacturer
 
05:29:24.470 --> 05:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
of ivig
 
05:29:26.788 --> 05:29:26.798 align:start position:0%
and the results given
 
05:29:29.030 --> 05:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
it always takes longer than we would
 
05:29:32.470 --> 05:29:32.480 align:start position:0%
like as uh as is on this side of the
 
05:29:34.230 --> 05:29:34.240 align:start position:0%
fence but
 
05:29:36.310 --> 05:29:36.320 align:start position:0%
the results of that probably won't be
 
05:29:38.788 --> 05:29:38.798 align:start position:0%
really known for the next four to five
 
05:29:38.798 --> 05:29:40.070 align:start position:0%
really known for the next four to five
years

05:29:40.070 --> 05:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
years
 
05:29:41.990 --> 05:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
so what i'm really
 
05:29:44.788 --> 05:29:44.798 align:start position:0%
hoping can happen is that at least this
 
05:29:46.628 --> 05:29:46.638 align:start position:0%
bill be extended
 
05:29:49.270 --> 05:29:49.280 align:start position:0%
if it's not rep if it's not the sunset
 
05:29:52.788 --> 05:29:52.798 align:start position:0%
repealed to be extended such time as
 
05:29:56.070 --> 05:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
some of this uh very important clinical
 
05:29:58.470 --> 05:29:58.480 align:start position:0%
trial work that's happening right now
 
05:30:00.868 --> 05:30:00.878 align:start position:0%
has a chance to show results what the
 
05:30:02.708 --> 05:30:02.718 align:start position:0%
results are and at that point i believe
 
05:30:06.310 --> 05:30:06.320 align:start position:0%
that there would be sufficient data for
 
05:30:08.628 --> 05:30:08.638 align:start position:0%
this body to really decide whether the
 
05:30:12.150 --> 05:30:12.160 align:start position:0%
bill is necessary and should continue
 
05:30:14.310 --> 05:30:14.320 align:start position:0%
but in the meantime i don't want
 
05:30:17.110 --> 05:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
families to be caught without protection
 
05:30:19.590 --> 05:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
until such time as that data does become
 
05:30:22.230 --> 05:30:22.240 align:start position:0%
available so i think based on that what
 
05:30:24.470 --> 05:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
i would suggest is that
 
05:30:26.948 --> 05:30:26.958 align:start position:0%
if we can't um
 
05:30:29.110 --> 05:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
remove the sunset claws at least extend
 
05:30:31.910 --> 05:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
it so that there's ample time because
 
05:30:34.548 --> 05:30:34.558 align:start position:0%
there is momentum and there is now
 
05:30:38.470 --> 05:30:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:41.430 --> 05:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
against the the claims and and and see
 
05:30:43.270 --> 05:30:43.280 align:start position:0%
the relevance of this bill but i can
 
05:30:45.190 --> 05:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
tell you it's had an impact
 
05:30:46.708 --> 05:30:46.718 align:start position:0%
and we would want to continue that
 
05:30:52.788 --> 05:30:52.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:56.708 --> 05:30:56.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:59.830 --> 05:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
okay i have no more cards
 
05:31:01.830 --> 05:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
anybody else want to speak and see none
 
05:31:03.110 --> 05:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
we'll close
 
05:31:05.190 --> 05:31:05.200 align:start position:0%
well before i close the public hearing
 
05:31:05.200 --> 05:31:06.830 align:start position:0%
well before i close the public hearing
the

05:31:06.830 --> 05:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:31:11.270 --> 05:31:11.280 align:start position:0%
um blue sheet uh blue sheet has
 
05:31:13.830 --> 05:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
nobody in support one person opposed
 
05:31:13.840 --> 05:31:15.670 align:start position:0%
nobody in support one person opposed
so

05:31:15.670 --> 05:31:15.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:31:15.680 --> 05:31:16.708 align:start position:0%
so
okay

05:31:16.708 --> 05:31:16.718 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:31:18.070 --> 05:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
with that i will
 
05:31:20.310 --> 05:31:20.320 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing
 
05:31:40.868 --> 05:31:40.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:15.350 --> 05:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:15.360 --> 05:32:30.708 align:start position:0%
 
now

05:32:30.708 --> 05:32:30.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:30.718 --> 05:32:36.868 align:start position:0%
 
i'm

05:32:36.868 --> 05:32:36.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:55.350 --> 05:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:20.548 --> 05:33:20.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:20.558 --> 05:33:21.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:33:21.990 --> 05:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:33:42.548 --> 05:33:42.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:18.708 --> 05:35:18.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:21.190 --> 05:35:21.200 align:start position:0%
you know so
 
05:35:24.628 --> 05:35:24.638 align:start position:0%
you never cease to amaze me
 
05:35:26.788 --> 05:35:26.798 align:start position:0%
all my years all my years as a
 
05:35:26.798 --> 05:35:28.948 align:start position:0%
all my years all my years as a
legislator

05:35:28.948 --> 05:35:28.958 align:start position:0%
legislator
 
05:35:30.470 --> 05:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
and for those of you who are new members
 
05:35:32.310 --> 05:35:32.320 align:start position:0%
who don't know about this but
 
05:35:33.350 --> 05:35:33.360 align:start position:0%
when you
 
05:35:35.670 --> 05:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
forget to vote when the buzzer goes off
 
05:35:38.628 --> 05:35:38.638 align:start position:0%
you then have to do the walk of shame
 
05:35:39.750 --> 05:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
down to
 
05:35:42.708 --> 05:35:42.718 align:start position:0%
the uh the clerk's uh booth and
 
05:35:44.548 --> 05:35:44.558 align:start position:0%
record your vote they would not let you
 
05:35:46.830 --> 05:35:46.840 align:start position:0%
do a hand signal you had to do
 
05:35:49.910 --> 05:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
this and everybody does oohs and oz and
 
05:35:51.510 --> 05:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
and i don't know how many years have i
 
05:35:53.670 --> 05:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
been doing this and i've never ever had
 
05:35:56.310 --> 05:35:56.320 align:start position:0%
to do that except once
 
05:36:00.948 --> 05:36:00.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:04.548 --> 05:36:04.558 align:start position:0%
and i had to do the walk of shame
 
05:36:06.628 --> 05:36:06.638 align:start position:0%
that was quite a session that those two
 
05:36:09.430 --> 05:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
years since it was
 
05:36:12.230 --> 05:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
all we had to do was to
 
05:36:14.310 --> 05:36:14.320 align:start position:0%
pay a little more attention maybe
 
05:36:16.390 --> 05:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
what she was probably doing something to
 
05:36:18.628 --> 05:36:18.638 align:start position:0%
preoccupy me or something i couldn't pay
 
05:36:20.788 --> 05:36:20.798 align:start position:0%
attention so
 
05:36:22.390 --> 05:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
05:36:25.990 --> 05:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
and welcome to the commerce committee
 
05:36:28.150 --> 05:36:28.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
05:36:30.868 --> 05:36:30.878 align:start position:0%
committee for hearing this bill
 
05:36:30.878 --> 05:36:31.830 align:start position:0%
committee for hearing this bill
um

05:36:31.830 --> 05:36:31.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:36:34.310 --> 05:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
the the reason i actually
 
05:36:36.390 --> 05:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
uh even know about
 
05:36:38.948 --> 05:36:38.958 align:start position:0%
pbms is because i was listening to a
 
05:36:40.948 --> 05:36:40.958 align:start position:0%
radio program
 
05:36:46.470 --> 05:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:48.628 --> 05:36:48.638 align:start position:0%
introducing legislation there
 
05:36:50.390 --> 05:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
about pbms
 
05:36:52.230 --> 05:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
where they were informing everyone and i
 
05:36:54.390 --> 05:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
was like boy you know that's supposed to
 
05:36:56.948 --> 05:36:56.958 align:start position:0%
save us all money when we go to the
 
05:36:59.030 --> 05:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
drugstore and get our prescriptions
 
05:36:59.040 --> 05:37:00.150 align:start position:0%
drugstore and get our prescriptions
filled

05:37:00.150 --> 05:37:00.160 align:start position:0%
filled
 
05:37:02.548 --> 05:37:02.558 align:start position:0%
so i thought well
 
05:37:04.150 --> 05:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
i wonder if anybody's doing that here in
 
05:37:05.350 --> 05:37:05.360 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
05:37:05.360 --> 05:37:06.070 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
so

05:37:06.070 --> 05:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:37:06.080 --> 05:37:06.948 align:start position:0%
so
i

05:37:06.948 --> 05:37:06.958 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:37:09.510 --> 05:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
decided that i would introduce this bill
 
05:37:11.830 --> 05:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
i am no expert
 
05:37:15.190 --> 05:37:15.200 align:start position:0%
it's extremely complex i probably can't
 
05:37:17.830 --> 05:37:17.840 align:start position:0%
answer very many questions but i'm going
 
05:37:19.910 --> 05:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
to read some of the key provisions of
 
05:37:23.430 --> 05:37:23.440 align:start position:0%
this bill and i this you have a
 
05:37:26.708 --> 05:37:26.718 align:start position:0%
single page two-sided copy of the
 
05:37:29.750 --> 05:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
provisions and um key provisions and the
 
05:37:31.990 --> 05:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
importance of those provisions
 
05:37:34.470 --> 05:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i
 
05:37:36.230 --> 05:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
we you know we're trying to get bill our
 
05:37:40.390 --> 05:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
bills down our electric bills and our uh
 
05:37:42.788 --> 05:37:42.798 align:start position:0%
medication bills down i mean just about
 
05:37:44.390 --> 05:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
everybody i know has some kind of
 
05:37:45.990 --> 05:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
medication or another that they have to
 
05:37:47.510 --> 05:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
pay for
 
05:37:47.520 --> 05:37:48.230 align:start position:0%
pay for
so

05:37:48.230 --> 05:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:37:50.708 --> 05:37:50.718 align:start position:0%
that's that's what the impetus for this
 
05:37:50.718 --> 05:37:51.590 align:start position:0%
that's that's what the impetus for this
is

05:37:51.590 --> 05:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:37:54.788 --> 05:37:54.798 align:start position:0%
so i'm just going to read this and and
 
05:37:57.510 --> 05:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
you could read along and i also
 
05:37:59.190 --> 05:37:59.200 align:start position:0%
printed out just a
 
05:38:00.628 --> 05:38:00.638 align:start position:0%
just a few
 
05:38:03.190 --> 05:38:03.200 align:start position:0%
sheets of information on this
 
05:38:08.150 --> 05:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:10.150 --> 05:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
oh god help me out here
 
05:38:10.160 --> 05:38:11.430 align:start position:0%
oh god help me out here
benefit

05:38:11.430 --> 05:38:11.440 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
05:38:13.670 --> 05:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
manager managers thank you
 
05:38:15.510 --> 05:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
because i'd never heard of them i mean
 
05:38:17.670 --> 05:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
it was something all new to me
 
05:38:19.590 --> 05:38:19.600 align:start position:0%
so the key provisions of this bill is
 
05:38:22.708 --> 05:38:22.718 align:start position:0%
that it requires licensure of pbms by
 
05:38:24.788 --> 05:38:24.798 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire commission
 
05:38:26.470 --> 05:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner now
 
05:38:27.990 --> 05:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
just off the bat
 
05:38:31.350 --> 05:38:31.360 align:start position:0%
i don't like regulation i don't like
 
05:38:33.910 --> 05:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
bigger government and i don't like the
 
05:38:35.430 --> 05:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
idea of
 
05:38:35.440 --> 05:38:36.470 align:start position:0%
idea of
of

05:38:36.470 --> 05:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:38:39.910 --> 05:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
governmental overreach but it almost
 
05:38:41.750 --> 05:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
seems to me that
 
05:38:44.548 --> 05:38:44.558 align:start position:0%
the pharmaceutical industry
 
05:38:46.788 --> 05:38:46.798 align:start position:0%
these pbms after checking them out a
 
05:38:51.350 --> 05:38:51.360 align:start position:0%
little bit seem to be almost um
 
05:38:52.948 --> 05:38:52.958 align:start position:0%
well i don't want to say racketeering
 
05:38:55.190 --> 05:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
what's the word
 
05:38:57.670 --> 05:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
manipulative no not manipulative they're
 
05:39:00.708 --> 05:39:00.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:00.718 --> 05:39:01.590 align:start position:0%
 
no

05:39:01.590 --> 05:39:01.600 align:start position:0%
no
 
05:39:03.990 --> 05:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
well whatever it'll come it'll come to
 
05:39:04.000 --> 05:39:05.350 align:start position:0%
well whatever it'll come it'll come to
me

05:39:05.350 --> 05:39:05.360 align:start position:0%
me
 
05:39:08.150 --> 05:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
is that autonomous representative
 
05:39:10.390 --> 05:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
they operate in their own little it's no
 
05:39:12.150 --> 05:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
it's not so much that because they're
 
05:39:14.310 --> 05:39:14.320 align:start position:0%
they're actually subcontracted by the
 
05:39:16.390 --> 05:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
insurance companies but one of the
 
05:39:16.400 --> 05:39:17.190 align:start position:0%
insurance companies but one of the
things

05:39:17.190 --> 05:39:17.200 align:start position:0%
things
 
05:39:19.190 --> 05:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
in the supply chain
 
05:39:22.628 --> 05:39:22.638 align:start position:0%
for from manufacturer to us when we go
 
05:39:25.350 --> 05:39:25.360 align:start position:0%
get our our meds
 
05:39:27.750 --> 05:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
there are all these different
 
05:39:29.510 --> 05:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
you know the guys that deliver it the
 
05:39:32.150 --> 05:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
guys that manufacture it the pharmacies
 
05:39:34.070 --> 05:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
all of that and the there's and the
 
05:39:35.430 --> 05:39:35.440 align:start position:0%
insurance companies
 
05:39:37.510 --> 05:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
and the insurance companies definitely
 
05:39:39.270 --> 05:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
have some
 
05:39:42.070 --> 05:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
say in what goes on but the pbms
 
05:39:44.230 --> 05:39:44.240 align:start position:0%
actually can see all of it
 
05:39:46.868 --> 05:39:46.878 align:start position:0%
so and if the if the price of the drugs
 
05:39:49.510 --> 05:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
go up then they get paid more and right
 
05:39:49.520 --> 05:39:50.470 align:start position:0%
go up then they get paid more and right
now

05:39:50.470 --> 05:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:39:55.030 --> 05:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
the worldwide industry they made 450
 
05:39:57.910 --> 05:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
billion dollars profit last year they
 
05:39:59.430 --> 05:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
get somewhere in the neighborhood of 50
 
05:40:01.030 --> 05:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
cents for every dollar
 
05:40:03.590 --> 05:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
and so i just thought wow that's uh
 
05:40:06.868 --> 05:40:06.878 align:start position:0%
profiteering that's the word so anyway
 
05:40:09.750 --> 05:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
i see mr chairman shaking his head at me
 
05:40:11.830 --> 05:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
john you know you love me
 
05:40:14.548 --> 05:40:14.558 align:start position:0%
okay so anyway requires this this the
 
05:40:16.548 --> 05:40:16.558 align:start position:0%
keepers provisions of this bill requires
 
05:40:19.350 --> 05:40:19.360 align:start position:0%
licensure of pm pbms by the new
 
05:40:20.948 --> 05:40:20.958 align:start position:0%
hampshire commissioner uh the
 
05:40:23.830 --> 05:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner can revoke licenses for a
 
05:40:25.590 --> 05:40:25.600 align:start position:0%
variety of reasons allows the
 
05:40:27.750 --> 05:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner to audit the pbm at their
 
05:40:30.070 --> 05:40:30.080 align:start position:0%
discretion to confirm they are in
 
05:40:33.030 --> 05:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
compliance with the laws and rules
 
05:40:35.030 --> 05:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
creates reporting requirements for the
 
05:40:37.350 --> 05:40:37.360 align:start position:0%
pbms which must be reported annually or
 
05:40:38.868 --> 05:40:38.878 align:start position:0%
more frequently as determined by the
 
05:40:38.878 --> 05:40:40.948 align:start position:0%
more frequently as determined by the
commissioner

05:40:40.948 --> 05:40:40.958 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
05:40:42.548 --> 05:40:42.558 align:start position:0%
and the importance of this is that this
 
05:40:44.708 --> 05:40:44.718 align:start position:0%
system of count of accountability
 
05:40:46.390 --> 05:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
through licensure
 
05:40:48.470 --> 05:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
and creating uh consequences for
 
05:40:50.470 --> 05:40:50.480 align:start position:0%
provisions of state law
 
05:40:53.830 --> 05:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
are not followed as
 
05:40:55.510 --> 05:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
if they're not followed it's vital as
 
05:40:56.788 --> 05:40:56.798 align:start position:0%
they have been
 
05:40:58.788 --> 05:40:58.798 align:start position:0%
there have been allegations of pbms
 
05:41:01.990 --> 05:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
ignoring legal requirements um in other
 
05:41:04.548 --> 05:41:04.558 align:start position:0%
states we're not the only state and i
 
05:41:06.868 --> 05:41:06.878 align:start position:0%
know new hampshire does have
 
05:41:09.350 --> 05:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
some oversight registration
 
05:41:11.430 --> 05:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
thank you registration
 
05:41:12.628 --> 05:41:12.638 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:41:12.638 --> 05:41:13.590 align:start position:0%
thank you
so

05:41:13.590 --> 05:41:13.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:41:15.190 --> 05:41:15.200 align:start position:0%
which is actually
 
05:41:17.270 --> 05:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
we're a little better off than a lot of
 
05:41:19.430 --> 05:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
states that don't have any of that
 
05:41:22.390 --> 05:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
and the pbms just go wild
 
05:41:24.788 --> 05:41:24.798 align:start position:0%
okay second key provision increases
 
05:41:26.868 --> 05:41:26.878 align:start position:0%
patient access to pharmacies and their
 
05:41:29.030 --> 05:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
medications which we all want all of
 
05:41:31.030 --> 05:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
that i don't even know anybody who there
 
05:41:33.190 --> 05:41:33.200 align:start position:0%
are very few people who don't go get
 
05:41:34.868 --> 05:41:34.878 align:start position:0%
something that they need
 
05:41:36.948 --> 05:41:36.958 align:start position:0%
uh this requires the pbm's network
 
05:41:40.470 --> 05:41:40.480 align:start position:0%
cannot be comprised of only mail order
 
05:41:42.788 --> 05:41:42.798 align:start position:0%
but should have a mix of mail order and
 
05:41:44.708 --> 05:41:44.718 align:start position:0%
physical stores in new hampshire one of
 
05:41:47.430 --> 05:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
the things this that the pbms actually
 
05:41:47.440 --> 05:41:49.430 align:start position:0%
the things this that the pbms actually
own

05:41:49.430 --> 05:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
own
 
05:41:51.030 --> 05:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
along with the insurance companies it's
 
05:41:52.390 --> 05:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
very complex
 
05:41:55.750 --> 05:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
they have mail-in
 
05:41:55.760 --> 05:41:57.590 align:start position:0%
they have mail-in
prescription

05:41:57.590 --> 05:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
prescription
 
05:41:59.990 --> 05:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
companies and they have their hands
 
05:42:02.310 --> 05:42:02.320 align:start position:0%
right in that till
 
05:42:04.310 --> 05:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
the importance is this will ensure that
 
05:42:05.990 --> 05:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
patients have access to physical
 
05:42:08.230 --> 05:42:08.240 align:start position:0%
pharmacies if they prefer to fill their
 
05:42:10.230 --> 05:42:10.240 align:start position:0%
medications there and have access to a
 
05:42:12.390 --> 05:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
pharmacy if they need to urgently fill a
 
05:42:12.400 --> 05:42:14.070 align:start position:0%
pharmacy if they need to urgently fill a
medication

05:42:14.070 --> 05:42:14.080 align:start position:0%
medication
 
05:42:16.708 --> 05:42:16.718 align:start position:0%
it bans pbms from limiting patients from
 
05:42:18.470 --> 05:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
choosing their own pharmacy or
 
05:42:21.190 --> 05:42:21.200 align:start position:0%
pharmacist which happens you sort of get
 
05:42:23.510 --> 05:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
locked into going to a certain place and
 
05:42:25.110 --> 05:42:25.120 align:start position:0%
the importance there is there have been
 
05:42:27.270 --> 05:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
uh reports of patients being steered to
 
05:42:29.430 --> 05:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
only receive their medications through
 
05:42:30.548 --> 05:42:30.558 align:start position:0%
mail in
 
05:42:33.830 --> 05:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
pharmacies which are often also owned by
 
05:42:36.470 --> 05:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
the the pbm
 
05:42:37.990 --> 05:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
i i just
 
05:42:39.910 --> 05:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
this can result in this
 
05:42:41.750 --> 05:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
severing of a long-standing patient
 
05:42:43.430 --> 05:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
pharmacist relationship and limiting
 
05:42:45.190 --> 05:42:45.200 align:start position:0%
patient choice as to where they can
 
05:42:48.150 --> 05:42:48.160 align:start position:0%
receive their medications uh it bans
 
05:42:51.030 --> 05:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
pbms from collecting cost share and that
 
05:42:53.750 --> 05:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
exceeds totals uh submitted charges by
 
05:42:56.310 --> 05:42:56.320 align:start position:0%
the pharmacy which happens
 
05:42:58.948 --> 05:42:58.958 align:start position:0%
i mean how can you how can you charge
 
05:43:01.190 --> 05:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
more than what it costs i
 
05:43:04.230 --> 05:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:05.670 --> 05:43:05.680 align:start position:0%
it blows my mind
 
05:43:05.680 --> 05:43:06.868 align:start position:0%
it blows my mind
uh

05:43:06.868 --> 05:43:06.878 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:43:08.948 --> 05:43:08.958 align:start position:0%
it bans points of sale and retroactive
 
05:43:11.030 --> 05:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
fees importance by banning these fees
 
05:43:13.990 --> 05:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
pharmacies will have a more
 
05:43:16.230 --> 05:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
substantial business model which will
 
05:43:18.470 --> 05:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
help to maintain their practice this
 
05:43:20.230 --> 05:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
will ensure patients continue to have
 
05:43:21.590 --> 05:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
access to their pharmacies and
 
05:43:23.510 --> 05:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
pharmacists and one of the things that's
 
05:43:25.430 --> 05:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
happening that's mom and pop
 
05:43:27.830 --> 05:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
apothecaries kind of are getting
 
05:43:31.110 --> 05:43:31.120 align:start position:0%
squished out and the the larger
 
05:43:34.548 --> 05:43:34.558 align:start position:0%
companies that have the bigger
 
05:43:36.470 --> 05:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
pharmacies are
 
05:43:36.480 --> 05:43:38.868 align:start position:0%
pharmacies are
gaining

05:43:38.868 --> 05:43:38.878 align:start position:0%
gaining
 
05:43:41.270 --> 05:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
puts it also puts restrictions on pbm's
 
05:43:44.390 --> 05:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
lowering reimbursements for 340b drugs
 
05:43:46.868 --> 05:43:46.878 align:start position:0%
importance this will ensure the
 
05:43:49.350 --> 05:43:49.360 align:start position:0%
most vulnerable members of our community
 
05:43:50.708 --> 05:43:50.718 align:start position:0%
continue to have access to their
 
05:43:52.628 --> 05:43:52.638 align:start position:0%
medications and access to the pharmacies
 
05:43:55.110 --> 05:43:55.120 align:start position:0%
where they fill their medications
 
05:43:57.030 --> 05:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
this is this is fairly we're almost done
 
05:44:01.910 --> 05:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
guys um it sets reimbursements for nadac
 
05:44:01.920 --> 05:44:03.150 align:start position:0%
guys um it sets reimbursements for nadac
plus

05:44:03.150 --> 05:44:03.160 align:start position:0%
plus
 
05:44:06.310 --> 05:44:06.320 align:start position:0%
10.49 dispensing fee and i to be honest
 
05:44:08.788 --> 05:44:08.798 align:start position:0%
with you i need to look at and see what
 
05:44:12.230 --> 05:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
the heck that is the national average
 
05:44:15.830 --> 05:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
drug acquisition cost
 
05:44:15.840 --> 05:44:16.628 align:start position:0%
drug acquisition cost
um

05:44:16.628 --> 05:44:16.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:44:19.190 --> 05:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
it bans pbms from discriminating in
 
05:44:20.948 --> 05:44:20.958 align:start position:0%
their reimbursement between different
 
05:44:22.788 --> 05:44:22.798 align:start position:0%
pharmacies and the importance there is
 
05:44:22.798 --> 05:44:23.750 align:start position:0%
pharmacies and the importance there is
that

05:44:23.750 --> 05:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:44:25.190 --> 05:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
there have been numerous reports of
 
05:44:28.310 --> 05:44:28.320 align:start position:0%
pharmacy closures that are a result of
 
05:44:30.788 --> 05:44:30.798 align:start position:0%
unsustainable business models often
 
05:44:33.990 --> 05:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
attributed to bb pbm practices by
 
05:44:36.470 --> 05:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
banning point of sale and retroactive
 
05:44:39.750 --> 05:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
active fees and setting a baseline
 
05:44:39.760 --> 05:44:41.310 align:start position:0%
active fees and setting a baseline
reimbursement

05:44:41.310 --> 05:44:41.320 align:start position:0%
reimbursement
 
05:44:43.430 --> 05:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
anti-competitive practices will be
 
05:44:45.350 --> 05:44:45.360 align:start position:0%
limited and pharmacies will be able to
 
05:44:47.270 --> 05:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
maintain their practices ensuring
 
05:44:50.230 --> 05:44:50.240 align:start position:0%
greater patient access to their local
 
05:44:53.030 --> 05:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
community pharmacists so that's
 
05:44:54.548 --> 05:44:54.558 align:start position:0%
kind of it in a nutshell
 
05:44:57.190 --> 05:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
and and as i said before i mean i can
 
05:44:59.190 --> 05:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
try to take questions but i don't know
 
05:45:01.910 --> 05:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
how i'm not technically savvy here
 
05:45:04.390 --> 05:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
actually the chairman probably is a lot
 
05:45:08.230 --> 05:45:08.240 align:start position:0%
more technically savvy than i am
 
05:45:10.868 --> 05:45:10.878 align:start position:0%
representative herbert has a question
 
05:45:10.878 --> 05:45:11.910 align:start position:0%
representative herbert has a question
um

05:45:11.910 --> 05:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:13.990 --> 05:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
just a question is i think we have
 
05:45:16.390 --> 05:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
somebody in the audience from anthem
 
05:45:18.628 --> 05:45:18.638 align:start position:0%
and i believe anthem brought their pbm
 
05:45:18.638 --> 05:45:20.070 align:start position:0%
and i believe anthem brought their pbm
in-house

05:45:20.070 --> 05:45:20.080 align:start position:0%
in-house
 
05:45:21.830 --> 05:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if that's the case would be
 
05:45:23.350 --> 05:45:23.360 align:start position:0%
nice but i would like to that's your
 
05:45:25.270 --> 05:45:25.280 align:start position:0%
question to it i would i would would you
 
05:45:27.430 --> 05:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
believe that was bringing the pbm in
 
05:45:27.440 --> 05:45:29.190 align:start position:0%
believe that was bringing the pbm in
house

05:45:29.190 --> 05:45:29.200 align:start position:0%
house
 
05:45:31.270 --> 05:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
i would believe that okay
 
05:45:33.590 --> 05:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
i would like to if i get the opportunity
 
05:45:36.628 --> 05:45:36.638 align:start position:0%
to listen to the anthem
 
05:45:39.670 --> 05:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
paul hasn't put a card in yet but
 
05:45:42.070 --> 05:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
okay representative burroughs
 
05:45:44.230 --> 05:45:44.240 align:start position:0%
yes as uh
 
05:45:47.430 --> 05:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
here we have a statement from the um
 
05:45:49.990 --> 05:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
the the insurance
 
05:45:51.830 --> 05:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
insurance folks here in the state house
 
05:45:53.830 --> 05:45:53.840 align:start position:0%
and they say that the licensure could
 
05:45:56.230 --> 05:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
mean that prices of drugs would actually
 
05:45:58.548 --> 05:45:58.558 align:start position:0%
go up because of the added expense
 
05:46:00.708 --> 05:46:00.718 align:start position:0%
to the pbms i'm wondering what what your
 
05:46:02.150 --> 05:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
take is on that
 
05:46:04.390 --> 05:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
well i do know that if the price of
 
05:46:06.788 --> 05:46:06.798 align:start position:0%
medications go up then the pbms actually
 
05:46:08.868 --> 05:46:08.878 align:start position:0%
make more money so they'd be happy with
 
05:46:11.190 --> 05:46:11.200 align:start position:0%
that because the more that the more
 
05:46:13.590 --> 05:46:13.600 align:start position:0%
money that the the
 
05:46:15.830 --> 05:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
medications cost the more money that the
 
05:46:18.628 --> 05:46:18.638 align:start position:0%
pbms can collect i don't know where to
 
05:46:20.628 --> 05:46:20.638 align:start position:0%
cite that for you
 
05:46:23.190 --> 05:46:23.200 align:start position:0%
follow-up um how did this question be
 
05:46:25.910 --> 05:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
inquired but would you believe that
 
05:46:27.830 --> 05:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
if the prices go up that the consumers
 
05:46:29.350 --> 05:46:29.360 align:start position:0%
are going to be the ones who who pay
 
05:46:32.150 --> 05:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
that incremental amount
 
05:46:33.990 --> 05:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
well we're going to be working on this
 
05:46:34.000 --> 05:46:35.590 align:start position:0%
well we're going to be working on this
um

05:46:35.590 --> 05:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:46:36.868 --> 05:46:36.878 align:start position:0%
over time
 
05:46:36.878 --> 05:46:37.670 align:start position:0%
over time
so

05:46:37.670 --> 05:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:46:39.270 --> 05:46:39.280 align:start position:0%
i'm pretty sure i know where this is all
 
05:46:41.110 --> 05:46:41.120 align:start position:0%
going to go
 
05:46:44.390 --> 05:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
once once i leave here
 
05:46:47.270 --> 05:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
but that's fine because we we want to
 
05:46:47.280 --> 05:46:48.788 align:start position:0%
but that's fine because we we want to
start

05:46:48.788 --> 05:46:48.798 align:start position:0%
start
 
05:46:50.708 --> 05:46:50.718 align:start position:0%
working and paying attention to this a
 
05:46:52.628 --> 05:46:52.638 align:start position:0%
little bit more now and i thank you very
 
05:46:54.070 --> 05:46:54.080 align:start position:0%
much for the question representative
 
05:46:54.080 --> 05:46:56.390 align:start position:0%
much for the question representative

05:47:07.830 --> 05:47:07.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and hello everyone my
 
05:47:09.830 --> 05:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
name is dennis acton i'm
 
05:47:11.110 --> 05:47:11.120 align:start position:0%
on the health and human services
 
05:47:13.110 --> 05:47:13.120 align:start position:0%
committee and i represent rockingham
 
05:47:16.708 --> 05:47:16.718 align:start position:0%
district 10 fremont and um so sue came
 
05:47:18.470 --> 05:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
to me with this bill and
 
05:47:20.628 --> 05:47:20.638 align:start position:0%
i i know a little bit about pharmacies
 
05:47:23.430 --> 05:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
um but i started delving into it and
 
05:47:26.150 --> 05:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
didn't like what what i found and and
 
05:47:28.070 --> 05:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
so basically um this piece of
 
05:47:29.990 --> 05:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
legislation i think is a first step in
 
05:47:32.230 --> 05:47:32.240 align:start position:0%
addressing some of these issues that are
 
05:47:34.788 --> 05:47:34.798 align:start position:0%
causing high prices so just to
 
05:47:36.150 --> 05:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
to um
 
05:47:39.990 --> 05:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
bring you into the actual legislation um
 
05:47:41.270 --> 05:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
some of the the points that were talking
 
05:47:44.070 --> 05:47:44.080 align:start position:0%
about that that sue introduced uh
 
05:47:46.708 --> 05:47:46.718 align:start position:0%
basically if we go to page five
 
05:47:48.628 --> 05:47:48.638 align:start position:0%
line 35
 
05:47:50.868 --> 05:47:50.878 align:start position:0%
this is a list of regulation of pharmacy
 
05:47:54.708 --> 05:47:54.718 align:start position:0%
benefit managers now and once again
 
05:47:57.110 --> 05:47:57.120 align:start position:0%
like sue reiterated we usually aren't
 
05:47:59.110 --> 05:47:59.120 align:start position:0%
introducing more licensing we're usually
 
05:48:01.030 --> 05:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
trying to to make it more efficient and
 
05:48:03.350 --> 05:48:03.360 align:start position:0%
so forth but we feel that th this
 
05:48:05.190 --> 05:48:05.200 align:start position:0%
problem has risen to that level that
 
05:48:07.590 --> 05:48:07.600 align:start position:0%
that needs to be to to give us the
 
05:48:10.548 --> 05:48:10.558 align:start position:0%
mechanism to to impose these um these
 
05:48:13.030 --> 05:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
regulations here but basically uh so we
 
05:48:16.470 --> 05:48:16.480 align:start position:0%
have um sections one two three
 
05:48:19.190 --> 05:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
and and four and five here but basically
 
05:48:21.110 --> 05:48:21.120 align:start position:0%
this is where you'll find um the
 
05:48:23.270 --> 05:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
solutions to the problems of like say
 
05:48:26.628 --> 05:48:26.638 align:start position:0%
with number one we have um
 
05:48:28.868 --> 05:48:28.878 align:start position:0%
pbms are actually penalizing
 
05:48:31.590 --> 05:48:31.600 align:start position:0%
pharmacists for giving pricing options
 
05:48:33.910 --> 05:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
to their customers so they're to the to
 
05:48:36.150 --> 05:48:36.160 align:start position:0%
the patients so that we're seeing that
 
05:48:37.430 --> 05:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
patients are actually paying more and
 
05:48:40.470 --> 05:48:40.480 align:start position:0%
not able to even be told that there's
 
05:48:42.310 --> 05:48:42.320 align:start position:0%
there may be a generic and and that's
 
05:48:44.708 --> 05:48:44.718 align:start position:0%
just wrong in in this especially
 
05:48:46.230 --> 05:48:46.240 align:start position:0%
we call that the gag clause and i
 
05:48:49.030 --> 05:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
thought we yeah well again we passed
 
05:48:49.040 --> 05:48:49.990 align:start position:0%
thought we yeah well again we passed
last

05:48:49.990 --> 05:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
last
 
05:48:52.150 --> 05:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
last year the gag law was passed um it's
 
05:48:53.670 --> 05:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
still a problem that needs to be
 
05:48:56.390 --> 05:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
addressed um according to the the people
 
05:48:58.470 --> 05:48:58.480 align:start position:0%
the experts that i've talked to so
 
05:48:58.480 --> 05:48:59.350 align:start position:0%
the experts that i've talked to so
um

05:48:59.350 --> 05:48:59.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:49:01.110 --> 05:49:01.120 align:start position:0%
but once again uh and there's a problem
 
05:49:03.110 --> 05:49:03.120 align:start position:0%
with prior approvals um
 
05:49:05.350 --> 05:49:05.360 align:start position:0%
and and so forth so that's that address
 
05:49:07.430 --> 05:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
that's addressed in there um the other
 
05:49:09.830 --> 05:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
the other problem is obviously the use
 
05:49:12.390 --> 05:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
of rebates and and how that's
 
05:49:14.868 --> 05:49:14.878 align:start position:0%
become a convoluted process that's not
 
05:49:14.878 --> 05:49:15.830 align:start position:0%
become a convoluted process that's not
it

05:49:15.830 --> 05:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:49:18.150 --> 05:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
so much of this doesn't
 
05:49:20.230 --> 05:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
help the patient it hurts the patient
 
05:49:21.270 --> 05:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
that's that's what we're trying to
 
05:49:23.110 --> 05:49:23.120 align:start position:0%
change and then there's also the process
 
05:49:25.430 --> 05:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
of clawbacks where the pharmacy will
 
05:49:28.548 --> 05:49:28.558 align:start position:0%
submit their claim to the pbm
 
05:49:31.430 --> 05:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
from the patient and they'll the pbm
 
05:49:32.868 --> 05:49:32.878 align:start position:0%
will say yes we'll pay ten dollars for
 
05:49:34.548 --> 05:49:34.558 align:start position:0%
that then they'll go and do further
 
05:49:36.070 --> 05:49:36.080 align:start position:0%
research and then say no now where else
 
05:49:37.750 --> 05:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely i'm gonna pay seven dollars
 
05:49:39.350 --> 05:49:39.360 align:start position:0%
for that and they claw back three
 
05:49:39.360 --> 05:49:40.390 align:start position:0%
for that and they claw back three
dollars

05:49:40.390 --> 05:49:40.400 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
05:49:42.868 --> 05:49:42.878 align:start position:0%
from a future payment uh
 
05:49:45.270 --> 05:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
reimbursement to the um the pharmacy we
 
05:49:46.788 --> 05:49:46.798 align:start position:0%
we feel that that's wrong
 
05:49:49.190 --> 05:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
we feel that when the claim is is paid
 
05:49:50.948 --> 05:49:50.958 align:start position:0%
there should be final and that's that's
 
05:49:53.270 --> 05:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
addressing number two
 
05:49:54.310 --> 05:49:54.320 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:49:55.270 --> 05:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
you know so
 
05:49:57.750 --> 05:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
it goes on for for a bunch of points
 
05:49:59.670 --> 05:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
there that you can read for yourself and
 
05:50:01.590 --> 05:50:01.600 align:start position:0%
things that we'll um we'll be looking
 
05:50:03.110 --> 05:50:03.120 align:start position:0%
into in the future
 
05:50:05.350 --> 05:50:05.360 align:start position:0%
and then the second point is actually
 
05:50:06.868 --> 05:50:06.878 align:start position:0%
page eight
 
05:50:08.230 --> 05:50:08.240 align:start position:0%
line one
 
05:50:10.150 --> 05:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
and that's the freedom of consumer
 
05:50:11.510 --> 05:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
choice for pharmacy now this could be
 
05:50:13.670 --> 05:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
its own standalone bill
 
05:50:15.350 --> 05:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
in the future but um
 
05:50:17.670 --> 05:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
this is this deals with the the vertical
 
05:50:19.830 --> 05:50:19.840 align:start position:0%
integration that we see where the the
 
05:50:21.910 --> 05:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
insurance company owns the the pharmacy
 
05:50:23.030 --> 05:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
and they they
 
05:50:25.030 --> 05:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
they control the whole pipeline and what
 
05:50:27.030 --> 05:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
they do is they
 
05:50:29.510 --> 05:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
penalize people if they go out if the
 
05:50:31.910 --> 05:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
patient goes to another pharmacy outside
 
05:50:33.670 --> 05:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
of that vertical market they pay they
 
05:50:35.510 --> 05:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
actually pay more but they're not told
 
05:50:37.910 --> 05:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
about that and i feel that that
 
05:50:39.510 --> 05:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
that is shouldn't
 
05:50:41.430 --> 05:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be allowed once again it's
 
05:50:42.868 --> 05:50:42.878 align:start position:0%
everything is working against the
 
05:50:44.628 --> 05:50:44.638 align:start position:0%
patient where it should be the opposite
 
05:50:46.310 --> 05:50:46.320 align:start position:0%
that's what i feel we should be working
 
05:50:46.320 --> 05:50:47.430 align:start position:0%
that's what i feel we should be working
for

05:50:47.430 --> 05:50:47.440 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:50:50.310 --> 05:50:50.320 align:start position:0%
so these points here in in the
 
05:50:51.990 --> 05:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
freedom of consumer
 
05:50:55.030 --> 05:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
choice for pharmacy deal with that very
 
05:50:56.948 --> 05:50:56.958 align:start position:0%
problem of being able to choose where
 
05:50:58.548 --> 05:50:58.558 align:start position:0%
you want to go and not be penalized by
 
05:51:00.230 --> 05:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
the pbm
 
05:51:01.910 --> 05:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
so that's basically it for for what i
 
05:51:03.270 --> 05:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
have to say certainly any final
 
05:51:05.350 --> 05:51:05.360 align:start position:0%
questions um we're realistic about this
 
05:51:08.230 --> 05:51:08.240 align:start position:0%
we know uh but this is the beginning of
 
05:51:10.150 --> 05:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
an issue that we want to address if we
 
05:51:12.310 --> 05:51:12.320 align:start position:0%
win our re-elections we'll be back to
 
05:51:14.190 --> 05:51:14.200 align:start position:0%
the visit and you'll be so lucky
 
05:51:14.200 --> 05:51:16.070 align:start position:0%
the visit and you'll be so lucky
[Laughter]

05:51:16.070 --> 05:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
05:51:17.830 --> 05:51:17.840 align:start position:0%
so where did you get the language for
 
05:51:19.110 --> 05:51:19.120 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
05:51:21.030 --> 05:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
where did you
 
05:51:23.430 --> 05:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
this language came from uh originally
 
05:51:26.470 --> 05:51:26.480 align:start position:0%
from legislation that was
 
05:51:29.750 --> 05:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
so i would say the very first bill
 
05:51:29.760 --> 05:51:30.868 align:start position:0%
so i would say the very first bill
that

05:51:30.868 --> 05:51:30.878 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:51:33.270 --> 05:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
i was chairman and i got overturned on
 
05:51:34.948 --> 05:51:34.958 align:start position:0%
the house floor
 
05:51:34.958 --> 05:51:35.990 align:start position:0%
the house floor
was

05:51:35.990 --> 05:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:51:37.430 --> 05:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
to allow
 
05:51:40.628 --> 05:51:40.638 align:start position:0%
new hampshire pharmacists to be able to
 
05:51:42.390 --> 05:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
uh get the
 
05:51:44.708 --> 05:51:44.718 align:start position:0%
uh fulfill a prescription at the same
 
05:51:44.718 --> 05:51:45.830 align:start position:0%
uh fulfill a prescription at the same
price

05:51:45.830 --> 05:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
price
 
05:51:47.910 --> 05:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
in compensation
 
05:51:50.548 --> 05:51:50.558 align:start position:0%
and this was 30 years ago so it was
 
05:51:52.788 --> 05:51:52.798 align:start position:0%
that donald lee lozo was
 
05:51:55.270 --> 05:51:55.280 align:start position:0%
overturned me on the floor on this issue
 
05:51:57.430 --> 05:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
so because it was considered a mandate
 
05:51:59.750 --> 05:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
but so i would say
 
05:52:01.590 --> 05:52:01.600 align:start position:0%
not with standing with ohio but in new
 
05:52:03.670 --> 05:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire this has been a law for a very
 
05:52:05.430 --> 05:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
long time
 
05:52:05.440 --> 05:52:06.150 align:start position:0%
long time
so

05:52:06.150 --> 05:52:06.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:52:08.230 --> 05:52:08.240 align:start position:0%
so some of these issues might be true
 
05:52:10.788 --> 05:52:10.798 align:start position:0%
you know in ohio but i would say a lot
 
05:52:12.070 --> 05:52:12.080 align:start position:0%
of these issues you know like i say the
 
05:52:14.948 --> 05:52:14.958 align:start position:0%
clawbacks and the and the and the gag
 
05:52:17.190 --> 05:52:17.200 align:start position:0%
rule and we've we've addressed all these
 
05:52:19.510 --> 05:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
issues already in the past but it is
 
05:52:21.990 --> 05:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
always nice to revisit the issues and
 
05:52:24.548 --> 05:52:24.558 align:start position:0%
see see what's out there so thank you
 
05:52:27.510 --> 05:52:27.520 align:start position:0%

today as well
 
05:53:32.548 --> 05:53:32.558 align:start position:0%
um i think i'd like to start with um a
 
05:53:34.470 --> 05:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
little bit of data to respond to one of
 
05:53:36.070 --> 05:53:36.080 align:start position:0%
the the last comments which we hear all
 
05:53:37.510 --> 05:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
the time about the squeeze on
 
05:53:39.990 --> 05:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
independent pharmacies uh i did a little
 
05:53:41.990 --> 05:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
research earlier in the week
 
05:53:43.510 --> 05:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
looking at the board of pharmacies
 
05:53:43.520 --> 05:53:44.548 align:start position:0%
looking at the board of pharmacies
website

05:53:44.548 --> 05:53:44.558 align:start position:0%
website
 
05:53:48.070 --> 05:53:48.080 align:start position:0%
there currently are 255
 
05:53:50.548 --> 05:53:50.558 align:start position:0%
retail pharmacy locations here in the
 
05:53:51.830 --> 05:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire that does not
 
05:53:53.708 --> 05:53:53.718 align:start position:0%
include a hospital pharmacy
 
05:53:53.718 --> 05:53:55.270 align:start position:0%
include a hospital pharmacy
255.

05:53:55.270 --> 05:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
255.
 
05:53:57.990 --> 05:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
one for if my math was right every 3 500
 
05:54:00.628 --> 05:54:00.638 align:start position:0%
people or something it's pretty healthy
 
05:54:02.548 --> 05:54:02.558 align:start position:0%
and it's growing
 
05:54:04.548 --> 05:54:04.558 align:start position:0%
as far as the independence go within the
 
05:54:07.750 --> 05:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
last 24 months according to the minutes
 
05:54:09.430 --> 05:54:09.440 align:start position:0%
of the board of pharmacy
 
05:54:12.708 --> 05:54:12.718 align:start position:0%
they've approved five new retail
 
05:54:15.110 --> 05:54:15.120 align:start position:0%
pharmacy locations
 
05:54:19.190 --> 05:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:22.230 --> 05:54:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:23.590 --> 05:54:23.600 align:start position:0%
i always thought the reason why some of
 
05:54:25.350 --> 05:54:25.360 align:start position:0%
those are retiring they're just retiring
 
05:54:27.110 --> 05:54:27.120 align:start position:0%
they're getting old and they're they're
 
05:54:28.548 --> 05:54:28.558 align:start position:0%
all done
 
05:54:30.868 --> 05:54:30.878 align:start position:0%
compounding well you know there was a
 
05:54:32.390 --> 05:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
point in time when you could say you
 
05:54:34.548 --> 05:54:34.558 align:start position:0%
know who is it or why is it the
 
05:54:36.310 --> 05:54:36.320 align:start position:0%
independents are going out of business
 
05:54:38.788 --> 05:54:38.798 align:start position:0%
if you have a chain come along and say
 
05:54:40.310 --> 05:54:40.320 align:start position:0%
hey mr pharmacist we're going to give
 
05:54:42.070 --> 05:54:42.080 align:start position:0%
you a boatload of money you can take
 
05:54:43.590 --> 05:54:43.600 align:start position:0%
four weeks of vacation every year and
 
05:54:44.868 --> 05:54:44.878 align:start position:0%
you can be a pharmacist instead of
 
05:54:46.070 --> 05:54:46.080 align:start position:0%
running a business you know who's going
 
05:54:47.670 --> 05:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
to say no
 
05:54:50.628 --> 05:54:50.638 align:start position:0%
but back to the bill at hand
 
05:54:52.230 --> 05:54:52.240 align:start position:0%
i hope you all had an opportunity to
 
05:54:53.670 --> 05:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
look at the email i had sent over the
 
05:54:55.910 --> 05:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
weekend which was give a little bit of a
 
05:54:58.548 --> 05:54:58.558 align:start position:0%
primer on what a pbm is what its
 
05:55:00.788 --> 05:55:00.798 align:start position:0%
function is what it does
 
05:55:04.390 --> 05:55:04.400 align:start position:0%
pbms serve their client entities to
 
05:55:07.190 --> 05:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
lower the prescription drug benefit for
 
05:55:09.830 --> 05:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
those entities now it's an an entity
 
05:55:11.830 --> 05:55:11.840 align:start position:0%
that i think is lost in a lot of these
 
05:55:14.230 --> 05:55:14.240 align:start position:0%
conversations quite frequently we talked
 
05:55:15.590 --> 05:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
about the pharmacy we talked about the
 
05:55:18.230 --> 05:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
pbm we talked about the manufacturer
 
05:55:19.670 --> 05:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
we don't talk about the folks that are
 
05:55:21.270 --> 05:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
paying the premium
 
05:55:22.788 --> 05:55:22.798 align:start position:0%
that are passing along some of the
 
05:55:25.190 --> 05:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
premium to their employees because the
 
05:55:27.510 --> 05:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
costs continue to increase the pbm
 
05:55:29.270 --> 05:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
serves to keep that cost as low as
 
05:55:32.310 --> 05:55:32.320 align:start position:0%
possible and the employer then is able
 
05:55:34.070 --> 05:55:34.080 align:start position:0%
to pass along some of the cost savings
 
05:55:35.750 --> 05:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
to their employees as best they can but
 
05:55:37.510 --> 05:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
it's their decision we have to please
 
05:55:39.350 --> 05:55:39.360 align:start position:0%
keep in mind the folks that pay the
 
05:55:39.360 --> 05:55:40.708 align:start position:0%
keep in mind the folks that pay the
bills

05:55:40.708 --> 05:55:40.718 align:start position:0%
bills
 
05:55:42.390 --> 05:55:42.400 align:start position:0%
pbms do that
 
05:55:44.070 --> 05:55:44.080 align:start position:0%
in a number of ways they provide a
 
05:55:45.910 --> 05:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
number of services which was on the on
 
05:55:47.670 --> 05:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
the chart
 
05:55:50.150 --> 05:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
which also serves the the patient as
 
05:55:50.160 --> 05:55:50.948 align:start position:0%
which also serves the the patient as
well

05:55:50.948 --> 05:55:50.958 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:55:53.110 --> 05:55:53.120 align:start position:0%
things like 24 7
 
05:55:55.190 --> 05:55:55.200 align:start position:0%
pharmacists at the other end of a phone
 
05:55:57.510 --> 05:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh drug utilization review
 
05:56:00.150 --> 05:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
looking at a customers or a patient's
 
05:56:01.670 --> 05:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
prescriptions to make sure there's
 
05:56:03.430 --> 05:56:03.440 align:start position:0%
there's no conflicting
 
05:56:06.948 --> 05:56:06.958 align:start position:0%
prescriptions but at its core the pbm
 
05:56:06.958 --> 05:56:08.708 align:start position:0%
prescriptions but at its core the pbm
negotiates

05:56:08.708 --> 05:56:08.718 align:start position:0%
negotiates
 
05:56:10.470 --> 05:56:10.480 align:start position:0%
for lower drug prices with the
 
05:56:10.480 --> 05:56:12.310 align:start position:0%
for lower drug prices with the
manufacturer

05:56:12.310 --> 05:56:12.320 align:start position:0%
manufacturer
 
05:56:15.270 --> 05:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
and you can imagine the leverage of pbm
 
05:56:17.190 --> 05:56:17.200 align:start position:0%
has representing tens of millions of
 
05:56:19.350 --> 05:56:19.360 align:start position:0%
lives versus an entity like the state of
 
05:56:20.788 --> 05:56:20.798 align:start position:0%
new hampshire which has tens of
 
05:56:23.430 --> 05:56:23.440 align:start position:0%
thousands of lives the pbm has much
 
05:56:25.350 --> 05:56:25.360 align:start position:0%
better opportunity to drive the prices
 
05:56:25.360 --> 05:56:26.470 align:start position:0%
better opportunity to drive the prices
down

05:56:26.470 --> 05:56:26.480 align:start position:0%
down
 
05:56:27.750 --> 05:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
and the state of new hampshire does by
 
05:56:30.788 --> 05:56:30.798 align:start position:0%
the way contract with a pbm to perform
 
05:56:32.948 --> 05:56:32.958 align:start position:0%
it those services on behalf of the state
 
05:56:34.788 --> 05:56:34.798 align:start position:0%
employees health plan
 
05:56:34.798 --> 05:56:36.470 align:start position:0%
employees health plan
um

05:56:36.470 --> 05:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:56:38.230 --> 05:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
so to get into some of the bill
 
05:56:40.310 --> 05:56:40.320 align:start position:0%
specifics i'd like to just go a little
 
05:56:41.910 --> 05:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
bit in order
 
05:56:43.270 --> 05:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
uh we think that many of these
 
05:56:45.190 --> 05:56:45.200 align:start position:0%
provisions are all
 
05:56:46.788 --> 05:56:46.798 align:start position:0%
duplicative with what's in place but
 
05:56:48.628 --> 05:56:48.638 align:start position:0%
many of them also are new and will
 
05:56:51.110 --> 05:56:51.120 align:start position:0%
remove those tools from the toolbox that
 
05:56:53.590 --> 05:56:53.600 align:start position:0%
the pbms use to lower the prices
 
05:56:56.390 --> 05:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
and it is several different pieces all
 
05:56:59.030 --> 05:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
in in one piece of legislation
 
05:57:01.430 --> 05:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
so when you get into the policy sections
 
05:57:04.230 --> 05:57:04.240 align:start position:0%
n3 and n5 near the beginning and near
 
05:57:06.230 --> 05:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
the end
 
05:57:08.390 --> 05:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
the licensure and registration as you
 
05:57:09.868 --> 05:57:09.878 align:start position:0%
mentioned mr chair
 
05:57:13.030 --> 05:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
2019 senate bill 226
 
05:57:15.510 --> 05:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
established a beefier registration
 
05:57:17.430 --> 05:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
process and reporting to the department
 
05:57:18.628 --> 05:57:18.638 align:start position:0%
of insurance
 
05:57:20.310 --> 05:57:20.320 align:start position:0%
that's fairly new
 
05:57:22.548 --> 05:57:22.558 align:start position:0%
that's already in statute
 
05:57:26.150 --> 05:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
there are some references to audits in
 
05:57:28.868 --> 05:57:28.878 align:start position:0%
this bill in 1580
 
05:57:31.430 --> 05:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
regulation or oversight of audits and in
 
05:57:33.350 --> 05:57:33.360 align:start position:0%
pharmacy rights in
 
05:57:35.750 --> 05:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
relative to audits was covered
 
05:57:39.590 --> 05:57:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh in 2013 by legislation and amended as
 
05:57:43.510 --> 05:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
recently as 2 as 2020
 
05:57:47.430 --> 05:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:49.430 --> 05:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
then we get into n4 which has a number
 
05:57:52.390 --> 05:57:52.400 align:start position:0%
of different parts roman one
 
05:57:53.750 --> 05:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
this was just mentioned would allow a
 
05:57:55.270 --> 05:57:55.280 align:start position:0%
pharmacist to let a patient know about a
 
05:57:56.868 --> 05:57:56.878 align:start position:0%
lower cost option
 
05:57:59.830 --> 05:57:59.840 align:start position:0%
this was addressed uh 2018
 
05:58:02.948 --> 05:58:02.958 align:start position:0%
in house bill 1719 and established that
 
05:58:04.470 --> 05:58:04.480 align:start position:0%
the contract between an insurance
 
05:58:06.948 --> 05:58:06.958 align:start position:0%
carrier or a pbm and a contract to
 
05:58:08.788 --> 05:58:08.798 align:start position:0%
pharmacy shall not contain a provision
 
05:58:10.548 --> 05:58:10.558 align:start position:0%
prohibiting a pharmacist from from
 
05:58:12.548 --> 05:58:12.558 align:start position:0%
providing certain information to the
 
05:58:15.510 --> 05:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
insured party that's covered
 
05:58:17.750 --> 05:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
roman 2 n4
 
05:58:20.070 --> 05:58:20.080 align:start position:0%
the language appears to
 
05:58:20.080 --> 05:58:21.350 align:start position:0%
the language appears to
link

05:58:21.350 --> 05:58:21.360 align:start position:0%
link
 
05:58:22.868 --> 05:58:22.878 align:start position:0%
a copay
 
05:58:25.510 --> 05:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
with the pharmacy reimbursement
 
05:58:27.270 --> 05:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
these are two transactions that really
 
05:58:28.948 --> 05:58:28.958 align:start position:0%
don't have anything to do with each
 
05:58:31.190 --> 05:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
other the copay is a function of a
 
05:58:34.230 --> 05:58:34.240 align:start position:0%
benefit design the employer
 
05:58:35.350 --> 05:58:35.360 align:start position:0%
or the
 
05:58:37.110 --> 05:58:37.120 align:start position:0%
benefit provider
 
05:58:39.270 --> 05:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
will establish a copay based upon what
 
05:58:41.670 --> 05:58:41.680 align:start position:0%
they wish to do with for their employees
 
05:58:43.430 --> 05:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
higher co-pays lower co-pays the
 
05:58:45.830 --> 05:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
pharmacy reimbursement is a contract
 
05:58:45.840 --> 05:58:47.590 align:start position:0%
pharmacy reimbursement is a contract
contracted

05:58:47.590 --> 05:58:47.600 align:start position:0%
contracted
 
05:58:49.430 --> 05:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
transaction between
 
05:58:51.910 --> 05:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
the entity the pbm or the carrier and
 
05:58:53.990 --> 05:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
the pharmacy they really don't have any
 
05:58:55.750 --> 05:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
interaction there
 
05:58:59.030 --> 05:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
the next several sections
 
05:58:59.040 --> 05:59:00.868 align:start position:0%
the next several sections
create

05:59:00.868 --> 05:59:00.878 align:start position:0%
create
 
05:59:04.070 --> 05:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
in reality a new mandated reimbursement
 
05:59:05.750 --> 05:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
mechanism that on its face is price
 
05:59:08.150 --> 05:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
fixing we're establishing in statute how
 
05:59:09.510 --> 05:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
much somebody's going to get paid for
 
05:59:09.520 --> 05:59:10.788 align:start position:0%
much somebody's going to get paid for
something

05:59:10.788 --> 05:59:10.798 align:start position:0%
something
 
05:59:14.390 --> 05:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
the pcma analysis for this is that it
 
05:59:16.708 --> 05:59:16.718 align:start position:0%
will cost new hampshire employers and
 
05:59:19.190 --> 05:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
families if it's passed on 78 million
 
05:59:21.190 --> 05:59:21.200 align:start position:0%
dollars a year
 
05:59:22.548 --> 05:59:22.558 align:start position:0%
i think that's
 
05:59:24.310 --> 05:59:24.320 align:start position:0%
plain and simple for these several
 
05:59:24.320 --> 05:59:25.830 align:start position:0%
plain and simple for these several
sections

05:59:25.830 --> 05:59:25.840 align:start position:0%
sections
 
05:59:29.110 --> 05:59:29.120 align:start position:0%
um a few sections after that
 
05:59:30.948 --> 05:59:30.958 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry um
 
05:59:32.310 --> 05:59:32.320 align:start position:0%
that was
 
05:59:32.320 --> 05:59:33.830 align:start position:0%
that was
n4

05:59:33.830 --> 05:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
n4
 
05:59:33.840 --> 05:59:34.948 align:start position:0%
n4
romans

05:59:34.948 --> 05:59:34.958 align:start position:0%
romans
 
05:59:41.350 --> 05:59:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:42.868 --> 05:59:42.878 align:start position:0%
this is the one that susan was referring
 
05:59:46.868 --> 05:59:46.878 align:start position:0%
to that was the average price plus 10.95
 
05:59:46.878 --> 05:59:49.750 align:start position:0%
to that was the average price plus 10.95
correct

05:59:49.750 --> 05:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:51.510 --> 05:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
so one of the confusing parts i should
 
05:59:53.910 --> 05:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
mention is that there's a slight
 
05:59:55.830 --> 05:59:55.840 align:start position:0%
typo in the drafting there are two
 
05:59:57.590 --> 05:59:57.600 align:start position:0%
sections n4
 
05:59:57.600 --> 05:59:58.470 align:start position:0%
sections n4
um

05:59:58.470 --> 05:59:58.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:00:04.788 --> 06:00:04.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:08.948 --> 06:00:08.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:11.430 --> 06:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
i think it's page
 
06:00:17.270 --> 06:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:19.830 --> 06:00:19.840 align:start position:0%
page 6 line 28
 
06:00:22.730 --> 06:00:22.740 align:start position:0%
for for that piece and that goes through
 
06:00:22.740 --> 06:00:24.470 align:start position:0%
for for that piece and that goes through
[Music]

06:00:24.470 --> 06:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:00:24.480 --> 06:00:25.350 align:start position:0%
[Music]
right

06:00:25.350 --> 06:00:25.360 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:00:27.110 --> 06:00:27.120 align:start position:0%
the next page middle of the the next
 
06:00:27.120 --> 06:00:30.868 align:start position:0%
the next page middle of the the next
page

06:00:30.868 --> 06:00:30.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:32.628 --> 06:00:32.638 align:start position:0%
the next subject
 
06:00:35.830 --> 06:00:35.840 align:start position:0%
that the bill covers is a prohibition on
 
06:00:37.350 --> 06:00:37.360 align:start position:0%
what's called performance-based
 
06:00:39.430 --> 06:00:39.440 align:start position:0%
contracts or value-based purchasing
 
06:00:39.440 --> 06:00:41.350 align:start position:0%
contracts or value-based purchasing
agreements

06:00:41.350 --> 06:00:41.360 align:start position:0%
agreements
 
06:00:43.590 --> 06:00:43.600 align:start position:0%
rather than paying a reimbursement for a
 
06:00:45.430 --> 06:00:45.440 align:start position:0%
pharmacy for volume
 
06:00:46.948 --> 06:00:46.958 align:start position:0%
the reimbursement
 
06:00:49.430 --> 06:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
model is for performance we want to make
 
06:00:49.440 --> 06:00:50.230 align:start position:0%
model is for performance we want to make
sure

06:00:50.230 --> 06:00:50.240 align:start position:0%
sure
 
06:00:52.150 --> 06:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
patients are getting in and taking
 
06:00:55.190 --> 06:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
medication there are many metrics uh
 
06:00:57.430 --> 06:00:57.440 align:start position:0%
that we'd like to make reimbursement on
 
06:01:02.070 --> 06:01:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:03.910 --> 06:01:03.920 align:start position:0%
under the bill
 
06:01:05.430 --> 06:01:05.440 align:start position:0%
pbm could not
 
06:01:07.110 --> 06:01:07.120 align:start position:0%
make sure a pharmacy is accountable for
 
06:01:09.670 --> 06:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
using the proper tools
 
06:01:11.590 --> 06:01:11.600 align:start position:0%
it's cost effective for the patient and
 
06:01:13.990 --> 06:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
the payer as well
 
06:01:14.000 --> 06:01:15.030 align:start position:0%
the payer as well
again

06:01:15.030 --> 06:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
again
 
06:01:17.830 --> 06:01:17.840 align:start position:0%
in the next end for is duplicative
 
06:01:19.590 --> 06:01:19.600 align:start position:0%
this is what the chair reference says
 
06:01:22.070 --> 06:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
the any willing provider statute
 
06:01:23.910 --> 06:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
been on the books for 30 years in
 
06:01:26.310 --> 06:01:26.320 align:start position:0%
essence it says that any pharmacy that's
 
06:01:27.670 --> 06:01:27.680 align:start position:0%
willing to agree to the terms and
 
06:01:31.190 --> 06:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
conditions must be led into the network
 
06:01:32.868 --> 06:01:32.878 align:start position:0%
in addition the
 
06:01:35.030 --> 06:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
department of insurance has fairly
 
06:01:37.830 --> 06:01:37.840 align:start position:0%
robust network adequacy requirements
 
06:01:39.990 --> 06:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
that were recently
 
06:01:42.548 --> 06:01:42.558 align:start position:0%
reviewed in revamped i guess you would
 
06:01:42.558 --> 06:01:43.750 align:start position:0%
reviewed in revamped i guess you would
say

06:01:43.750 --> 06:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
say
 
06:01:45.990 --> 06:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
maybe three or four years ago
 
06:01:46.000 --> 06:01:46.868 align:start position:0%
maybe three or four years ago
that's

06:01:46.868 --> 06:01:46.878 align:start position:0%
that's
 
06:01:50.150 --> 06:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:52.310 --> 06:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
so the sum of it is
 
06:01:54.230 --> 06:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
many portions of the bill are
 
06:01:54.240 --> 06:01:55.670 align:start position:0%
many portions of the bill are
duplicative

06:01:55.670 --> 06:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
duplicative
 
06:01:58.548 --> 06:01:58.558 align:start position:0%
or they interfere in and have the state
 
06:02:01.430 --> 06:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
step into the provisions of a contract
 
06:02:03.350 --> 06:02:03.360 align:start position:0%
that's negotiated between two private
 
06:02:03.360 --> 06:02:04.470 align:start position:0%
that's negotiated between two private
entities

06:02:04.470 --> 06:02:04.480 align:start position:0%
entities
 
06:02:04.480 --> 06:02:05.350 align:start position:0%
entities
um

06:02:05.350 --> 06:02:05.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:02:07.990 --> 06:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
there are a few pieces that touch on
 
06:02:11.670 --> 06:02:11.680 align:start position:0%
could touch on erisa preemptions as well
 
06:02:14.070 --> 06:02:14.080 align:start position:0%
that's been the subject of
 
06:02:16.548 --> 06:02:16.558 align:start position:0%
both legislation and court cases
 
06:02:18.788 --> 06:02:18.798 align:start position:0%
several court cases ongoing
 
06:02:20.788 --> 06:02:20.798 align:start position:0%
which if the state this state were the
 
06:02:23.110 --> 06:02:23.120 align:start position:0%
way into it could be a pro costly
 
06:02:25.910 --> 06:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
proposition in and of itself so
 
06:02:27.190 --> 06:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to answer questions i don't
 
06:02:30.548 --> 06:02:30.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:32.868 --> 06:02:32.878 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
06:02:38.310 --> 06:02:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:39.830 --> 06:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
we'll be around if they're if questions
 
06:02:42.628 --> 06:02:42.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:44.868 --> 06:02:44.878 align:start position:0%
uh i have one more card left tyler
 
06:02:46.548 --> 06:02:46.558 align:start position:0%
brennan from the insurance department
 
06:03:02.390 --> 06:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:04.070 --> 06:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
tyler brennan life and health director
 
06:03:05.110 --> 06:03:05.120 align:start position:0%
with the new hampshire insurance
 
06:03:06.548 --> 06:03:06.558 align:start position:0%
department and right we don't have a
 
06:03:08.230 --> 06:03:08.240 align:start position:0%
position um
 
06:03:09.750 --> 06:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
by way of background the insurance
 
06:03:12.070 --> 06:03:12.080 align:start position:0%
department has regulated a little closer
 
06:03:14.310 --> 06:03:14.320 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks
 
06:03:15.830 --> 06:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
by way of background the insurance
 
06:03:18.390 --> 06:03:18.400 align:start position:0%
department has regulated pvms as a part
 
06:03:20.948 --> 06:03:20.958 align:start position:0%
of the insurance company's operations
 
06:03:23.350 --> 06:03:23.360 align:start position:0%
so on more recent years we started to
 
06:03:25.430 --> 06:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
define them and provide specific
 
06:03:27.670 --> 06:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
requirements that apply to pbms in the
 
06:03:30.310 --> 06:03:30.320 align:start position:0%
insurance code but um but it's never
 
06:03:32.310 --> 06:03:32.320 align:start position:0%
that we haven't regulated them that
 
06:03:33.990 --> 06:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
being said they've been subject to
 
06:03:35.670 --> 06:03:35.680 align:start position:0%
insurance insurance laws when they've
 
06:03:37.430 --> 06:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
been administering benefits for fully
 
06:03:39.190 --> 06:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
insured products
 
06:03:41.110 --> 06:03:41.120 align:start position:0%
so um
 
06:03:43.350 --> 06:03:43.360 align:start position:0%
a few years ago we defined pvm and chat
 
06:03:45.510 --> 06:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
in the statute then we created a new
 
06:03:47.910 --> 06:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
chapter which had most of the same
 
06:03:49.430 --> 06:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
requirements that were already in the
 
06:03:51.910 --> 06:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
insurance statute and called the pbm
 
06:03:52.948 --> 06:03:52.958 align:start position:0%
chapter and that's what created the
 
06:03:55.670 --> 06:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
registration requirements
 
06:03:58.548 --> 06:03:58.558 align:start position:0%
this bill has a lot of new provisions
 
06:04:00.390 --> 06:04:00.400 align:start position:0%
one of the things that was done very
 
06:04:01.990 --> 06:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
carefully when that new chapter was
 
06:04:04.628 --> 06:04:04.638 align:start position:0%
created was to define pbm so that
 
06:04:07.670 --> 06:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
applied only to fully insured business
 
06:04:09.190 --> 06:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
the definition that's in this
 
06:04:11.990 --> 06:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
legislation does not do the same thing
 
06:04:13.830 --> 06:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
so it assumedly brings in the
 
06:04:16.628 --> 06:04:16.638 align:start position:0%
self-insured side of things as well and
 
06:04:18.390 --> 06:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
it was already mentioned but the ruling
 
06:04:21.510 --> 06:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
versus pcma supreme court decision was a
 
06:04:23.590 --> 06:04:23.600 align:start position:0%
bit of a surprise for some of us it had
 
06:04:25.430 --> 06:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
to do with the amounts that pharmacies
 
06:04:27.830 --> 06:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
were paid and saying yeah states can
 
06:04:29.750 --> 06:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
actually regulate that when the pbm is
 
06:04:31.990 --> 06:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
operating that way that being said to
 
06:04:33.190 --> 06:04:33.200 align:start position:0%
the extent that you're looking at
 
06:04:35.030 --> 06:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
regulating pbms you still have to be
 
06:04:37.350 --> 06:04:37.360 align:start position:0%
careful about federal preemption
 
06:04:40.310 --> 06:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
and obviously if something is at odds
 
06:04:42.230 --> 06:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
with erisa preemption it could
 
06:04:43.910 --> 06:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
invalidate the whole new legislation or
 
06:04:45.990 --> 06:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
the whole new chapter
 
06:04:47.510 --> 06:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
when i looked through a lot of the more
 
06:04:49.430 --> 06:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
controversial areas of the bill and
 
06:04:51.670 --> 06:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
kurds did go through most of them one of
 
06:04:53.750 --> 06:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
them as it relates to network adequacy
 
06:04:55.430 --> 06:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
is actually a good example of something
 
06:04:57.110 --> 06:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
that would be preempted i mean that goes
 
06:04:59.110 --> 06:04:59.120 align:start position:0%
to the benefit design that is beyond
 
06:05:01.190 --> 06:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
kind of the state
 
06:05:02.548 --> 06:05:02.558 align:start position:0%
doing something in terms of
 
06:05:04.788 --> 06:05:04.798 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates to pharmacies
 
06:05:06.390 --> 06:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
there are a number of other provisions
 
06:05:07.830 --> 06:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
that are in there that could be
 
06:05:09.910 --> 06:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
considered controversial they've come to
 
06:05:11.750 --> 06:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
this committee in separate legislation
 
06:05:14.628 --> 06:05:14.638 align:start position:0%
in a number of different ways and
 
06:05:15.830 --> 06:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
among them are how much that
 
06:05:18.150 --> 06:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
reimbursement would go to the particular
 
06:05:19.910 --> 06:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
provider and
 
06:05:21.830 --> 06:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
most of these i think that curtis did
 
06:05:23.670 --> 06:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
mention but no pharmacy tiering is
 
06:05:25.750 --> 06:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
another one
 
06:05:27.350 --> 06:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
reduction in cost sharing for use of
 
06:05:28.788 --> 06:05:28.798 align:start position:0%
mail order and then there are
 
06:05:31.030 --> 06:05:31.040 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction issues so it makes
 
06:05:33.510 --> 06:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
reference to new hampshire residents the
 
06:05:35.750 --> 06:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
way we regulate insurance it deals with
 
06:05:37.510 --> 06:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
whether or not the policy is cited to
 
06:05:39.270 --> 06:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire think the employer's
 
06:05:41.990 --> 06:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
headquarters is in new hampshire or
 
06:05:44.310 --> 06:05:44.320 align:start position:0%
you work at a bricks and mortar location
 
06:05:45.990 --> 06:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
so if you're a new hampshire resident
 
06:05:47.670 --> 06:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
but you work in massachusetts you get
 
06:05:48.948 --> 06:05:48.958 align:start position:0%
your insurance through blue cross blue
 
06:05:50.948 --> 06:05:50.958 align:start position:0%
shield of massachusetts that's not
 
06:05:52.628 --> 06:05:52.638 align:start position:0%
something that's not a policy subject to
 
06:05:55.110 --> 06:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
our jurisdiction so that creates some
 
06:05:56.948 --> 06:05:56.958 align:start position:0%
some issues on that front
 
06:05:58.628 --> 06:05:58.638 align:start position:0%
one of the things that was added to that
 
06:06:01.030 --> 06:06:01.040 align:start position:0%
pbm registration chapter at the request
 
06:06:03.190 --> 06:06:03.200 align:start position:0%
of the insurance department was the
 
06:06:05.350 --> 06:06:05.360 align:start position:0%
ability for the insurance department to
 
06:06:08.470 --> 06:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
build a pbm directly for market conduct
 
06:06:08.480 --> 06:06:09.750 align:start position:0%
build a pbm directly for market conduct
examination

06:06:09.750 --> 06:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
examination
 
06:06:12.548 --> 06:06:12.558 align:start position:0%
remember everything we do as a regulator
 
06:06:14.708 --> 06:06:14.718 align:start position:0%
goes through the insurance company so
 
06:06:16.310 --> 06:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
there has been a certain amount of
 
06:06:18.390 --> 06:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
tension between some insurance companies
 
06:06:20.548 --> 06:06:20.558 align:start position:0%
and their pbm over the years and that's
 
06:06:22.070 --> 06:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons that some insurers
 
06:06:24.230 --> 06:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
are now owning their own pbms and
 
06:06:26.548 --> 06:06:26.558 align:start position:0%
maintaining a bit more control so if the
 
06:06:28.548 --> 06:06:28.558 align:start position:0%
pbm was doing something wrong the
 
06:06:30.470 --> 06:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
carrier is technically responsible for
 
06:06:32.708 --> 06:06:32.718 align:start position:0%
what the pvm is doing we would issue a
 
06:06:34.390 --> 06:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
market conduct examination to the
 
06:06:36.390 --> 06:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
carrier we would build a carrier for
 
06:06:39.030 --> 06:06:39.040 align:start position:0%
that examination but the reality is the
 
06:06:40.628 --> 06:06:40.638 align:start position:0%
pbm is the one we should be targeting
 
06:06:42.708 --> 06:06:42.718 align:start position:0%
those efforts at so as a part of the new
 
06:06:44.628 --> 06:06:44.638 align:start position:0%
chapter there was a section saying the
 
06:06:47.590 --> 06:06:47.600 align:start position:0%
insurance department can bill the pbm
 
06:06:50.548 --> 06:06:50.558 align:start position:0%
directly for that market conduct exam so
 
06:06:52.230 --> 06:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
if you do decide to proceed with this
 
06:06:54.628 --> 06:06:54.638 align:start position:0%
this bill and pass it we would request
 
06:06:56.708 --> 06:06:56.718 align:start position:0%
that that that provision
 
06:07:01.270 --> 06:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:01.280 --> 06:07:02.230 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:07:02.230 --> 06:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:07:03.670 --> 06:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions you would
 
06:07:03.680 --> 06:07:06.628 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions you would
have

06:07:06.628 --> 06:07:06.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:10.788 --> 06:07:10.798 align:start position:0%

callahan and gartrell and i represent
 
06:07:49.910 --> 06:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
ahip which is america's health insurance
 
06:07:52.470 --> 06:07:52.480 align:start position:0%
plans um
 
06:07:53.990 --> 06:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
we agree with
 
06:07:56.310 --> 06:07:56.320 align:start position:0%
much of the testimony that
 
06:07:58.548 --> 06:07:58.558 align:start position:0%
pcma has provided to you today so i'm
 
06:08:00.470 --> 06:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
not going to repeat any of that there is
 
06:08:03.270 --> 06:08:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:04.628 --> 06:08:04.638 align:start position:0%
provision that i wanted to kind of
 
06:08:06.708 --> 06:08:06.718 align:start position:0%
highlight for you and i do have
 
06:08:10.230 --> 06:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
testimony that's being handed around
 
06:08:12.788 --> 06:08:12.798 align:start position:0%
so limiting my comments to the proposed
 
06:08:12.798 --> 06:08:14.230 align:start position:0%
so limiting my comments to the proposed
section

06:08:14.230 --> 06:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
section
 
06:08:15.670 --> 06:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
on page six
 
06:08:18.150 --> 06:08:18.160 align:start position:0%
lines fourteen to twenty four
 
06:08:21.910 --> 06:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
deal relating to the 340 b discount drug
 
06:08:23.750 --> 06:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
pricing program
 
06:08:25.430 --> 06:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
and there is a
 
06:08:27.270 --> 06:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
fact sheet that we've included behind
 
06:08:28.948 --> 06:08:28.958 align:start position:0%
the testimony
 
06:08:31.430 --> 06:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
so house bill 1580 would require
 
06:08:34.548 --> 06:08:34.558 align:start position:0%
reimbursement to a 340b entity
 
06:08:37.030 --> 06:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
for drugs that are purchased at a deep
 
06:08:40.830 --> 06:08:40.840 align:start position:0%
discounts under the federal program
 
06:08:43.990 --> 06:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
um at a rate at least as great as that
 
06:08:46.948 --> 06:08:46.958 align:start position:0%
paid to non-340b entities that are not
 
06:08:49.270 --> 06:08:49.280 align:start position:0%
entitled to purchase those drugs at the
 
06:08:51.750 --> 06:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
deep um federal
 
06:08:54.070 --> 06:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
program discounts and so the bills
 
06:08:56.470 --> 06:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
provisions essentially guarantee in
 
06:08:58.548 --> 06:08:58.558 align:start position:0%
state law
 
06:09:01.190 --> 06:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
some pretty outrageous price profits
 
06:09:03.670 --> 06:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
that were recently found in a study
 
06:09:05.830 --> 06:09:05.840 align:start position:0%
called examining hospital trace price
 
06:09:08.230 --> 06:09:08.240 align:start position:0%
transparency drug profits and the 340b
 
06:09:08.240 --> 06:09:10.230 align:start position:0%
transparency drug profits and the 340b
program

06:09:10.230 --> 06:09:10.240 align:start position:0%
program
 
06:09:12.390 --> 06:09:12.400 align:start position:0%
and you know we're concerned about this
 
06:09:14.548 --> 06:09:14.558 align:start position:0%
section because as the study found that
 
06:09:17.190 --> 06:09:17.200 align:start position:0%
340b hospitals often charge their cash
 
06:09:20.070 --> 06:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
paying customers meaning the uninsured
 
06:09:21.910 --> 06:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
the same as the median price for
 
06:09:24.150 --> 06:09:24.160 align:start position:0%
commercial carriers which was found to
 
06:09:26.948 --> 06:09:26.958 align:start position:0%
be about approximately 400 percent of
 
06:09:28.788 --> 06:09:28.798 align:start position:0%
their cost
 
06:09:30.548 --> 06:09:30.558 align:start position:0%
and that's there's that's included in
 
06:09:32.310 --> 06:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
the attachment so
 
06:09:34.948 --> 06:09:34.958 align:start position:0%
we would support
 
06:09:36.628 --> 06:09:36.638 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate on this piece
 
06:09:39.430 --> 06:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
of legislation and that provision is
 
06:09:41.430 --> 06:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
particularly concerning so i thank you
 
06:09:43.190 --> 06:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
for your time and
 
06:09:45.350 --> 06:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
06:09:47.990 --> 06:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
questions seeing oh representative no
 
06:09:49.910 --> 06:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
you're all set okay representative abel
 
06:09:51.030 --> 06:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
has a question
 
06:09:53.350 --> 06:09:53.360 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you thank you for
 
06:09:56.310 --> 06:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
testifying um just to
 
06:09:57.830 --> 06:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh be clear
 
06:09:57.840 --> 06:09:59.350 align:start position:0%
uh be clear
um

06:09:59.350 --> 06:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:10:02.230 --> 06:10:02.240 align:start position:0%
you're you're uh
 
06:10:04.230 --> 06:10:04.240 align:start position:0%
opposed to the bill
 
06:10:07.350 --> 06:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
and you believe that the current system
 
06:10:11.350 --> 06:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
is is doing a better job than what would
 
06:10:13.430 --> 06:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
than what would happen if this bill were
 
06:10:15.510 --> 06:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
passed or maybe you could elaborate
 
06:10:17.510 --> 06:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
slightly on that
 
06:10:19.030 --> 06:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
sure i mean i think as you've heard from
 
06:10:20.390 --> 06:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
the prior testimony
 
06:10:22.390 --> 06:10:22.400 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of
 
06:10:25.590 --> 06:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
work over the years in terms of passing
 
06:10:28.070 --> 06:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
various pieces of legislation that put
 
06:10:30.150 --> 06:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
into place
 
06:10:32.150 --> 06:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
the registration and reporting
 
06:10:35.190 --> 06:10:35.200 align:start position:0%
requirements and the gag clause and
 
06:10:39.030 --> 06:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
any willing provider and so i think
 
06:10:41.910 --> 06:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
i think that in most cases the
 
06:10:43.830 --> 06:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
each section of this bill has already
 
06:10:45.590 --> 06:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
been addressed elsewhere in new
 
06:10:50.628 --> 06:10:50.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:51.430 --> 06:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:10:53.430 --> 06:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
all right oh representative herbert you
 
06:10:58.868 --> 06:10:58.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:01.270 --> 06:11:01.280 align:start position:0%
you can talk to her afterwards
 
06:11:03.990 --> 06:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
she wasn't signed up to testify
 
06:11:07.030 --> 06:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
well i i wanted to because i know that
 
06:11:08.628 --> 06:11:08.638 align:start position:0%
they brought
 
06:11:09.830 --> 06:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
in house
 
06:11:11.510 --> 06:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
the pbm
 
06:11:13.750 --> 06:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
since the last time we were discussing
 
06:11:16.150 --> 06:11:16.160 align:start position:0%
this legislation so i would like to get
 
06:11:18.070 --> 06:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
a feel for
 
06:11:20.948 --> 06:11:20.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:22.628 --> 06:11:22.638 align:start position:0%
do you ready to make that presentation
 
06:11:22.638 --> 06:11:28.470 align:start position:0%
do you ready to make that presentation
paul

06:11:28.470 --> 06:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:30.390 --> 06:11:30.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and
 
06:11:30.400 --> 06:11:32.070 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and
representative

06:11:32.070 --> 06:11:32.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:11:34.390 --> 06:11:34.400 align:start position:0%
here's the issue anthem does own its own
 
06:11:38.310 --> 06:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
pbm it's called ingenio rx
 
06:11:41.270 --> 06:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
uh this is not a typical i believe cigna
 
06:11:42.788 --> 06:11:42.798 align:start position:0%
i don't know whether the signal rep is
 
06:11:44.390 --> 06:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
here in the room but i think they own
 
06:11:45.910 --> 06:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
express scripts
 
06:11:48.390 --> 06:11:48.400 align:start position:0%
and i think as tyler indicated
 
06:11:50.628 --> 06:11:50.638 align:start position:0%
the bringing in house
 
06:11:53.190 --> 06:11:53.200 align:start position:0%
a pbm gives the carrier more control
 
06:11:54.948 --> 06:11:54.958 align:start position:0%
over their pbm and then of course they
 
06:11:56.708 --> 06:11:56.718 align:start position:0%
can sell those services
 
06:11:59.190 --> 06:11:59.200 align:start position:0%
to others so they not only serve their
 
06:12:00.628 --> 06:12:00.638 align:start position:0%
own population
 
06:12:02.230 --> 06:12:02.240 align:start position:0%
and have better care management with
 
06:12:04.310 --> 06:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
their members in that regard but they
 
06:12:06.948 --> 06:12:06.958 align:start position:0%
also sell their services externally
 
06:12:09.990 --> 06:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
and so that's anthem's pbm the one
 
06:12:11.270 --> 06:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
interesting thing i might add to
 
06:12:13.110 --> 06:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
anything that's been said here i know
 
06:12:15.030 --> 06:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
that people are struggling with the
 
06:12:16.948 --> 06:12:16.958 align:start position:0%
concept of well how do you get a hold of
 
06:12:19.190 --> 06:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
drug pricing well you begin somewhere
 
06:12:20.788 --> 06:12:20.798 align:start position:0%
and it's probably at the top with the
 
06:12:23.270 --> 06:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and yes the pbms
 
06:12:25.110 --> 06:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
downstream are making money there's no
 
06:12:27.030 --> 06:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
doubt about it but it's very hard to
 
06:12:29.190 --> 06:12:29.200 align:start position:0%
weigh what they do and think about well
 
06:12:30.628 --> 06:12:30.638 align:start position:0%
what sort of profits do they really
 
06:12:32.310 --> 06:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
deserve i could never answer that
 
06:12:35.350 --> 06:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
question but new hampshire last
 
06:12:37.510 --> 06:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
two was a year before last
 
06:12:40.150 --> 06:12:40.160 align:start position:0%
established a drug affordability board
 
06:12:41.590 --> 06:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
and so right now some of your
 
06:12:44.548 --> 06:12:44.558 align:start position:0%
compatriots senators and
 
06:12:46.548 --> 06:12:46.558 align:start position:0%
appointees to this drug affordability
 
06:12:48.628 --> 06:12:48.638 align:start position:0%
board are doing what a lot of states are
 
06:12:50.628 --> 06:12:50.638 align:start position:0%
doing and are now really looking
 
06:12:52.628 --> 06:12:52.638 align:start position:0%
directly at what they can do
 
06:12:55.030 --> 06:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
to bring certain drugs down into an
 
06:12:56.948 --> 06:12:56.958 align:start position:0%
affordability range for purchase in the
 
06:12:58.708 --> 06:12:58.718 align:start position:0%
state and i think we're going to have to
 
06:13:01.190 --> 06:13:01.200 align:start position:0%
start looking at ways to do that in a
 
06:13:03.830 --> 06:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
very aggressive fashion going forward
 
06:13:06.150 --> 06:13:06.160 align:start position:0%
the regulatory scene here i think tyler
 
06:13:08.548 --> 06:13:08.558 align:start position:0%
explained the department is new to their
 
06:13:10.948 --> 06:13:10.958 align:start position:0%
registration format
 
06:13:13.430 --> 06:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
this is more a licensure format but i
 
06:13:15.190 --> 06:13:15.200 align:start position:0%
haven't really read the bill closely but
 
06:13:17.590 --> 06:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
as i heard curtis berry going through it
 
06:13:19.110 --> 06:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
clearly there are some provisions in
 
06:13:20.708 --> 06:13:20.718 align:start position:0%
there which seem
 
06:13:22.788 --> 06:13:22.798 align:start position:0%
contrary to what we would really want to
 
06:13:25.190 --> 06:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
happen here and it's important that you
 
06:13:27.110 --> 06:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
look at all the things that we have done
 
06:13:29.590 --> 06:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
as representative hunt pointed to where
 
06:13:31.830 --> 06:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
we've really made some strides that that
 
06:13:33.910 --> 06:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
bill would think we had not yet covered
 
06:13:36.548 --> 06:13:36.558 align:start position:0%
so it's a huge huge issue and it's ten
 
06:13:37.990 --> 06:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
after three and you've been here since
 
06:13:39.830 --> 06:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
nine o'clock so unless you have
 
06:13:42.150 --> 06:13:42.160 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you thank you
 
06:13:43.510 --> 06:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
very much paul
 
06:13:47.110 --> 06:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
okay having no more cards uh 1580 yes uh
 
06:13:49.190 --> 06:13:49.200 align:start position:0%
lindsay nitto who's not here from cigna
 
06:13:51.750 --> 06:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
is in opposition to the bill
 
06:13:51.760 --> 06:13:53.350 align:start position:0%
is in opposition to the bill
and

06:13:53.350 --> 06:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:13:57.350 --> 06:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh there was one support in five opposed
 
06:13:59.110 --> 06:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
on the blue sheets
 
06:14:00.470 --> 06:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
this goes to show who knows where these
 
06:14:02.470 --> 06:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
are coming from
 
06:14:04.150 --> 06:14:04.160 align:start position:0%
with that i will close the public
 
06:14:04.160 --> 06:16:56.070 align:start position:0%
with that i will close the public
hearing

06:16:56.070 --> 06:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:56.080 --> 06:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
you
