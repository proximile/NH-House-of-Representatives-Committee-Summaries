comprehensive solution to some of the

challenges facing the department of
 
00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 align:start position:0%
corrections as it fulfills its
 
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
responsibility to conduct competency
 
00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 align:start position:0%
hearings it aims to incentivize
 
00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:34.039 align:start position:0%
attendance mitigate problems created
 
00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 align:start position:0%
when people fail to show for their exams
 
00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:38.919 align:start position:0%
and provides a mechanism for dismissing
 
00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 align:start position:0%
charges with cases deemed
 
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 align:start position:0%
nonrestorable this legislation is the
 
00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
product of a collaboration by many
 
00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:51.039 align:start position:0%
parties um but particularly it's the
 
00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:53.479 align:start position:0%
work of experts from the Department of
 
00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
Corrections who I believe are
 
00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 align:start position:0%
represented here today with input and
 
00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 align:start position:0%
suggestions from the AC you and criminal
 
00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
defense attorneys um I would ask you to
 
00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 align:start position:0%
look favorably upon this um legislation
 
00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
as I said I believe there are folks here
 
00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 align:start position:0%
from the Department that can speak to
 
00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:16.199 align:start position:0%
the more technical aspects of how the um
 
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
testony and be happy to answer any
 
00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:27.759 align:start position:0%
questions um but certainly would defer
 
00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 align:start position:0%
if if they are more technical in nature
 
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 align:start position:0%

forensic
examiners

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:11.160 align:start position:0%
examiners
 
00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:15.199 align:start position:0%
um thank you for uh listening to us on
 
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
um in our support of SB
 
00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:21.800 align:start position:0%
314 this as Senator Susi said before was
 
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
a collaborative effort we when it was
 
00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:27.440 align:start position:0%
introduced um by Senator Chanley and we
 
00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:29.000 align:start position:0%
had our first hearing there were a
 
00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:31.240 align:start position:0%
couple of concerns that were expressed
 
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
by the ACLU and the New Hampshire
 
00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
Association of defense attorneys during
 
00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.080 align:start position:0%
that time so we were able to sit down as
 
00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:40.120 align:start position:0%
a group and collaboratively work on
 
00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:44.080 align:start position:0%
those differences together um and I
 
00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:46.520 align:start position:0%
think that the the product here is is a
 
00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:48.639 align:start position:0%
great bill that we can all agree on I
 
00:06:50.909 --> 00:06:50.919 align:start position:0%
also just wanted to add that uh the
 
00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner Hanks was sorry that she
 
00:06:54.029 --> 00:06:54.039 align:start position:0%
couldn't be here this morning but she is
 
00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
at a funeral um otherwise she would have
 
00:06:58.749 --> 00:06:58.759 align:start position:0%
been here to testify um and then I'm
 
00:07:01.309 --> 00:07:01.319 align:start position:0%
going to let Barb speak to a lot of the
 
00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:04.639 align:start position:0%
technical um pieces of the office FR
 
00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:07.919 align:start position:0%
examiners um she is by far the expert so
 
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
I'm going to turn it over to her no
 
00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:13.360 align:start position:0%

examiners um and I am here to speak in
 
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
support of SB
 
00:07:40.749 --> 00:07:40.759 align:start position:0%
314 um so the Department of Corrections
 
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
uh contracts with Wexford Health sources
 
00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:46.120 align:start position:0%
um for all of the positions that are
 
00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:48.280 align:start position:0%
filled at the office of the forensic
 
00:07:50.149 --> 00:07:50.159 align:start position:0%
examiners the office of forensic
 
00:07:52.909 --> 00:07:52.919 align:start position:0%
examiners began in the early 2000s
 
00:07:55.589 --> 00:07:55.599 align:start position:0%
around that time with one examiner and
 
00:07:58.230 --> 00:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
one administrative support person over
 
00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:01.280 align:start position:0%
the time all our numbers of evaluation
 
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
requests increased uh at some point we
 
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
were at three forensic evaluators
 
00:08:10.749 --> 00:08:10.759 align:start position:0%
currently we are staffed uh funded for
 
00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:14.120 align:start position:0%
one Chief forensic examiner uh
 
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:18.280 align:start position:0%
4.8 uh examiners forensic examiners and
 
00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:21.280 align:start position:0%
two administrative staff positions at
 
00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:24.680 align:start position:0%
this time we have uh two vacant uh
 
00:08:27.469 --> 00:08:27.479 align:start position:0%
forensic evaluator positions and one
 
00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
vacant administrative position
 
00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:33.760 align:start position:0%
the increase in competency evaluations
 
00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
is something that's not unique to New
 
00:08:39.269 --> 00:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the need has been driven um by
 
00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:41.000 align:start position:0%
several different factors Across the
 
00:08:43.949 --> 00:08:43.959 align:start position:0%
Nation and so we just as every other
 
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
state have had an increase in those
 
00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:48.320 align:start position:0%
numbers that's put a strain on the
 
00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
amount of experts that we have in these
 
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:54.720 align:start position:0%
areas to work so we continue to um to
 
00:08:59.030 --> 00:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
look to other states to uh network with
 
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:01.480 align:start position:0%
graduate school programs for forensic
 
00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:04.680 align:start position:0%
psychologists to recruit um for
 
00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:08.320 align:start position:0%
in-person State inate evaluators at this
 
00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
time uh we have uh we kind of pivoted
 
00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
and we had hired some uh remote
 
00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:17.240 align:start position:0%
evaluators from out of state who are
 
00:09:20.949 --> 00:09:20.959 align:start position:0%
forensic evaluators to assist in um
 
00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
filling those two positions that we have
 
00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
open the SB 314 um hits on a couple of
 
00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
issues that we have at the of um we have
 
00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
a backlog of cases those cases came um
 
00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
slowly over time and then a little
 
00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:41.640 align:start position:0%
faster um in about
 
00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:45.800 align:start position:0%
2001 we saw an increase to over 800
 
00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:47.720 align:start position:0%
orders whereas prior to that we were
 
00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:52.360 align:start position:0%
only getting 500 to 600 orders a year um
 
00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
So within the last um since 2001 we've
 
00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.550 align:start position:0%
So within the last um since 2001 we've
averaged

00:09:57.550 --> 00:09:57.560 align:start position:0%
averaged
 
00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
836 evaluations oh sorry
 
00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
2021 2021 we've averaged 836 orders
 
00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
which is roughly about a 20% increase
 
00:10:09.829 --> 00:10:09.839 align:start position:0%
the other challenge that we do have is a
 
00:10:12.269 --> 00:10:12.279 align:start position:0%
high no-show rate um part of that is
 
00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:15.240 align:start position:0%
because of the population that we serve
 
00:10:18.389 --> 00:10:18.399 align:start position:0%
um several are unhoused um mental health
 
00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:21.560 align:start position:0%
problems substance abuse problems but
 
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:23.200 align:start position:0%
that still is a high no-show rate and
 
00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
when that occurs um we have prepared and
 
00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
the evaluator is there and that time is
 
00:10:32.509 --> 00:10:32.519 align:start position:0%
is is wasted in that sense although we
 
00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:35.720 align:start position:0%
do other tasks um but it also then
 
00:10:39.069 --> 00:10:39.079 align:start position:0%
produces another court order because
 
00:10:40.509 --> 00:10:40.519 align:start position:0%
that goes back to the court and they
 
00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:42.680 align:start position:0%
re-refer the individual back so that is
 
00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
also part of the increase in orders that
 
00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:47.519 align:start position:0%
we've seen is that high no-show rate
 
00:10:48.829 --> 00:10:48.839 align:start position:0%
which averages about
 
00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:53.320 align:start position:0%
30% um and um so that's kind of why we
 
00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
address this this bill so SB 314 creates
 
00:10:58.629 --> 00:10:58.639 align:start position:0%
incentives for individuals to appear for
 
00:11:01.509 --> 00:11:01.519 align:start position:0%
court order evaluations it allows an
 
00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
extension of the time frame for
 
00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
evaluations to be done if the individual
 
00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:10.079 align:start position:0%
fails fails to appear or if we are uh if
 
00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:12.040 align:start position:0%
we fail to be provided with the records
 
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
that we need that I'll speak to in a
 
00:11:16.389 --> 00:11:16.399 align:start position:0%
moment um and the hope is that by
 
00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:18.760 align:start position:0%
reducing that no-show rate it will
 
00:11:20.389 --> 00:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
increase our efficiency by allowing us
 
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:24.160 align:start position:0%
to see those cases and will then um
 
00:11:25.629 --> 00:11:25.639 align:start position:0%
decrease the amount of orders that we're
 
00:11:27.509 --> 00:11:27.519 align:start position:0%
getting because of those repeat orders
 
00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:32.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:35.720 align:start position:0%
um additional language emphasizes that
 
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
in an instant when an
 
00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:40.360 align:start position:0%
individual is not competent and not
 
00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:43.320 align:start position:0%
restorable and that is something that is
 
00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
is obvious to the court that it
 
00:11:49.389 --> 00:11:49.399 align:start position:0%
reinforces what already is existing
 
00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
legal Authority for them to dismiss the
 
00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
charges with out Prejudice so this in
 
00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:57.560 align:start position:0%
314 what we aim to do was to instill
 
00:11:59.430 --> 00:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
that confidence that they would be be
 
00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
able to dismiss those charges um in
 
00:12:04.829 --> 00:12:04.839 align:start position:0%
those straightforward cases in which the
 
00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:07.720 align:start position:0%
court feels confident in making that
 
00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
call um the other important part which
 
00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
is very important to me as a a forensic
 
00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
examiner is the issue of Records um
 
00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:19.480 align:start position:0%
often we have uh difficulties getting
 
00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:22.240 align:start position:0%
medical educational and mental health
 
00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:25.720 align:start position:0%
records for multiple reasons in 314 we
 
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
addressed um that
 
00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
the uh court is allowed to order those
 
00:12:35.269 --> 00:12:35.279 align:start position:0%
records with for the last three years
 
00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:37.240 align:start position:0%
and additionally if we find that we need
 
00:12:39.069 --> 00:12:39.079 align:start position:0%
them for any reason that those can be
 
00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:41.800 align:start position:0%
ordered to be delivered to us medical
 
00:12:43.389 --> 00:12:43.399 align:start position:0%
mental health and educational records
 
00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
are important because they allow us to
 
00:12:49.389 --> 00:12:49.399 align:start position:0%
conduct and inform a valid and reliable
 
00:12:51.829 --> 00:12:51.839 align:start position:0%
Report with opinions for the court to
 
00:12:53.509 --> 00:12:53.519 align:start position:0%
make their decisions which is what our
 
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
goal is they contain a rich history of
 
00:12:57.509 --> 00:12:57.519 align:start position:0%
someone's mental health and medical
 
00:12:59.949 --> 00:12:59.959 align:start position:0%
history that lets us see the traj Tory
 
00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:03.160 align:start position:0%
and the symptoms for Diagnostic purposes
 
00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
for intervention purposes they
 
00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
illuminate what medications they are and
 
00:13:10.829 --> 00:13:10.839 align:start position:0%
those factors can impact um mental
 
00:13:12.629 --> 00:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
status factors and their ability to
 
00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
participate in their defense and make
 
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
decisions about their cases beyond that
 
00:13:20.629 --> 00:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
the medical records inform their medical
 
00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:22.240 align:start position:0%
conditions that may be impacting
 
00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
impacting their competency related
 
00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:27.880 align:start position:0%
abilities they also serve to either
 
00:13:30.829 --> 00:13:30.839 align:start position:0%
confirm or contest the symptoms or the
 
00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
experiences that the individual is
 
00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:34.600 align:start position:0%
reporting to us which are also very
 
00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:36.440 align:start position:0%
important and all of those contribute to
 
00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
us being able to offer the judges
 
00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
informed valid and reliable opinions
 
00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:45.160 align:start position:0%
regarding competency to proceed and
 
00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:47.560 align:start position:0%
restorability and dangerousness which
 
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
are the three things that we're tasked
 
00:13:52.509 --> 00:13:52.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:54.749 --> 00:13:54.759 align:start position:0%
13517 so those are the main pieces that
 
00:13:58.550 --> 00:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
I wanted to cover for 314 um I we are
 
00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.350 align:start position:0%
I wanted to cover for 314 um I we are
currently

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:14:02.389 --> 00:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
um uh I wanted to make clear that the
 
00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections is the entity
 
00:14:07.069 --> 00:14:07.079 align:start position:0%
that's currently funded to support these
 
00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
forensic evaluations under the office of
 
00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:09.990 align:start position:0%
forensic evaluations under the office of
forensic

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
forensic
 
00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:13.000 align:start position:0%
examiners we take our job very seriously
 
00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
at the of we know that it is an
 
00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
important task um that quality
 
00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
evaluations are important for the legal
 
00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
process and for the courts and for the
 
00:14:24.829 --> 00:14:24.839 align:start position:0%
individuals that we are serving as well
 
00:14:26.269 --> 00:14:26.279 align:start position:0%
so I want to thank you all for
 
00:14:29.069 --> 00:14:29.079 align:start position:0%
considering um my comments today and if
 
00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
if you have any questions I will be
 
00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:33.560 align:start position:0%
happy to try to answer them for you yes
 
00:14:35.949 --> 00:14:35.959 align:start position:0%
uh representative Smith thank you very
 
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
much thank you for your your testimony
 
00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:42.440 align:start position:0%
when you say um that you that there's
 
00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:44.440 align:start position:0%
difficulty sometimes getting the records
 
00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:46.720 align:start position:0%
and this gives you the
 
00:14:51.509 --> 00:14:51.519 align:start position:0%
power or some power to to get those
 
00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:54.160 align:start position:0%
records where are the
 
00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
records so when uh evaluations are
 
00:15:02.069 --> 00:15:02.079 align:start position:0%
ordered um the the uh defense Council
 
00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
the defendant the defendant is the one
 
00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:06.440 align:start position:0%
that holds the power to their medical
 
00:15:09.069 --> 00:15:09.079 align:start position:0%
records mental health records um so
 
00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
those records are uh sometimes
 
00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
provided by defense Council and the
 
00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:19.720 align:start position:0%
defendant sometimes for some reason
 
00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:21.560 align:start position:0%
though that permission does not get is
 
00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:24.160 align:start position:0%
not given by the defendant for multiple
 
00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
reasons or we are not provided with them
 
00:15:27.749 --> 00:15:27.759 align:start position:0%
from defense Council for multiple
 
00:15:30.749 --> 00:15:30.759 align:start position:0%
reasons this allows the court the power
 
00:15:33.829 --> 00:15:33.839 align:start position:0%
to order those records in all of the
 
00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
cases so that they have to be provided
 
00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.870 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:15:51.509 --> 00:15:51.519 align:start position:0%
is what comes to mind and this is
 
00:15:53.629 --> 00:15:53.639 align:start position:0%
probably the wrong thing to come to mind
 
00:15:57.189 --> 00:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
so you straighten me out please is
 
00:15:59.910 --> 00:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
something along the lines of self
 
00:16:05.389 --> 00:16:05.399 align:start position:0%
incrimination um as why why wouldn't the
 
00:16:07.949 --> 00:16:07.959 align:start position:0%
defense or the why wouldn't not the
 
00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:10.680 align:start position:0%
defense why wouldn't those records be
 
00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
provided so um incompetent uh
 
00:16:19.949 --> 00:16:19.959 align:start position:0%
self-incrimination is protected um um so
 
00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:21.800 align:start position:0%
when an individual meets with me for
 
00:16:23.749 --> 00:16:23.759 align:start position:0%
competency evaluation while not the
 
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
information is not confidential we do
 
00:16:27.389 --> 00:16:27.399 align:start position:0%
not speak to anything that could be
 
00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:29.560 align:start position:0%
incriminating in any way
 
00:16:32.749 --> 00:16:32.759 align:start position:0%
um and my report is only to be used to
 
00:16:35.389 --> 00:16:35.399 align:start position:0%
address the competency issues it is not
 
00:16:38.069 --> 00:16:38.079 align:start position:0%
to be used in any further trial
 
00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:40.600 align:start position:0%
processes I am not called to testify any
 
00:16:42.949 --> 00:16:42.959 align:start position:0%
further it is limited and sealed to that
 
00:16:42.959 --> 00:16:44.150 align:start position:0%
further it is limited and sealed to that
competency

00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
competency
 
00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:48.040 align:start position:0%
evaluation um defense Council um is
 
00:16:50.389 --> 00:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
tasked with defending their client and
 
00:16:53.949 --> 00:16:53.959 align:start position:0%
so if their client does not want those
 
00:16:56.629 --> 00:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
records for released for any reason um
 
00:16:59.470 --> 00:16:59.480 align:start position:0%
defense Council um
 
00:17:02.069 --> 00:17:02.079 align:start position:0%
in those cases will not readily give
 
00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
those records this allows the court to
 
00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
order those records to be given to us
 
00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:10.360 align:start position:0%
not to other parties but to the doctor
 
00:17:12.909 --> 00:17:12.919 align:start position:0%
who is doing the evaluation to inform
 
00:17:12.919 --> 00:17:13.870 align:start position:0%
who is doing the evaluation to inform
the

00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:13.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:17.480 align:start position:0%
court does that answer your question Mr
 
00:17:19.789 --> 00:17:19.799 align:start position:0%
chair yes representative D Lorenzo and
 
00:17:22.110 --> 00:17:22.120 align:start position:0%
then representative H uh thank you and
 
00:17:24.949 --> 00:17:24.959 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um I'm
 
00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
I just feel like we need to back up a
 
00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:29.000 align:start position:0%
little bit I I I don't really understand
 
00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:33.080 align:start position:0%
how a person um is scheduled for a
 
00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
competency hearing is that um certainly
 
00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
is that for all um no no so um
 
00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:44.600 align:start position:0%
competency is raised um it's an ethical
 
00:17:48.029 --> 00:17:48.039 align:start position:0%
obligation for uh attorneys to raise
 
00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:50.280 align:start position:0%
competency if they have any concerns
 
00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:54.360 align:start position:0%
that their client um does not understand
 
00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:57.080 align:start position:0%
the legal proceedings be it the legal
 
00:17:59.190 --> 00:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
system the charges that are brought
 
00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:02.120 align:start position:0%
against them and also it is their right
 
00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
that they have the ability to assist
 
00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:09.480 align:start position:0%
Council in mounting their defense so um
 
00:18:13.549 --> 00:18:13.559 align:start position:0%
in those cases competency is raised so
 
00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
the cases in which competency are raised
 
00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
are those that where the individual has
 
00:18:19.149 --> 00:18:19.159 align:start position:0%
a mental health history often we see
 
00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
that it is raised when um substance uh
 
00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:25.640 align:start position:0%
substance issues come in um as council
 
00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
is not an expert in whether or not these
 
00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
are limited substance in educed uh
 
00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
mental health symptoms that they're
 
00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
having but if they cannot communicate
 
00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
with our client to make those decisions
 
00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:37.640 align:start position:0%
they're going to raise competency um and
 
00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
the and and legally they can
 
00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
everything's put on hold they cannot
 
00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
proceed until the individual is stable
 
00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:49.320 align:start position:0%
and able to assist in their defense and
 
00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:50.440 align:start position:0%
understand what's going on during the
 
00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:55.029 align:start position:0%
understand what's going on during the
legal

00:18:55.029 --> 00:18:55.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:57.080 align:start position:0%
proceedings uh well first representative
 
00:19:01.669 --> 00:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:04.760 align:start position:0%
please yes I'm um specifically and I
 
00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
suppose you deal with this issue already
 
00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:09.240 align:start position:0%
but like what's on page two
 
00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
about um e the course show are all
 
00:19:13.909 --> 00:19:13.919 align:start position:0%
medical and mental health and
 
00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
educational record past three years be
 
00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
provided um we're dealing with a
 
00:19:21.029 --> 00:19:21.039 align:start position:0%
population who at a minimum are in legal
 
00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:23.000 align:start position:0%
trouble and have mental health issues
 
00:19:25.149 --> 00:19:25.159 align:start position:0%
their life is probably also chaotic in a
 
00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:27.720 align:start position:0%
lot of other ways so how who's supposed
 
00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
to round round up these records and
 
00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
Supply them probably most of the people
 
00:19:33.149 --> 00:19:33.159 align:start position:0%
do not have a neatly ordered file
 
00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:35.360 align:start position:0%
cabinet in their office with like all
 
00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
these things in chronological order so
 
00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:40.720 align:start position:0%
how do you get get hold of these records
 
00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
and what is it and again like what do
 
00:19:45.029 --> 00:19:45.039 align:start position:0%
you and then which what is that you're
 
00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:47.320 align:start position:0%
looking for the records so there are two
 
00:19:49.789 --> 00:19:49.799 align:start position:0%
different ways that um that records are
 
00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
obtained um a lot of times defense
 
00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
counil um right off the bat will have
 
00:19:56.909 --> 00:19:56.919 align:start position:0%
their clients sign release forms and
 
00:19:58.110 --> 00:19:58.120 align:start position:0%
they will send them out to the different
 
00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
facilities that they are aware that they
 
00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:02.360 align:start position:0%
did have treatment or may have had
 
00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:05.080 align:start position:0%
treatment um the second part is that a
 
00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:07.480 align:start position:0%
court order um so the court orders that
 
00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:10.280 align:start position:0%
those records be released directly to
 
00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
the office of forensic examiners and the
 
00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:15.200 align:start position:0%
court order is sent directly to the
 
00:20:17.669 --> 00:20:17.679 align:start position:0%
facilities so a lot of times we'll know
 
00:20:18.909 --> 00:20:18.919 align:start position:0%
from the interview where the
 
00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:20.360 align:start position:0%
individual's been treated or we'll have
 
00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:22.840 align:start position:0%
a good idea um and so we'll send off
 
00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:25.480 align:start position:0%
those releases to get those
 
00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:27.640 align:start position:0%
records representative
 
00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:30.750 align:start position:0%
records representative
Kat

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:33.880 align:start position:0%
just a question on the the language here
 
00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
so this is stating that the court shall
 
00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:40.200 align:start position:0%
order that all medical mental health and
 
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
educational records from the last three
 
00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:44.120 align:start position:0%
years we provided to the forensic
 
00:20:46.669 --> 00:20:46.679 align:start position:0%
examiner wouldn't it be better to say
 
00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:48.360 align:start position:0%
may order that way the court is
 
00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:50.120 align:start position:0%
determining whether or not the record
 
00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
should be sent because there may be
 
00:20:54.549 --> 00:20:54.559 align:start position:0%
medical records which are completely
 
00:20:57.710 --> 00:20:57.720 align:start position:0%
unrelated to the mental health status
 
00:20:59.590 --> 00:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
that might be otherwise private that the
 
00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:01.640 align:start position:0%
person may not
 
00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
want to be aired so to speak so the
 
00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:07.720 align:start position:0%
reason that we say all mental health
 
00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
records and medical records and
 
00:21:10.909 --> 00:21:10.919 align:start position:0%
educational records for the last three
 
00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
years is that we will review them um and
 
00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:18.400 align:start position:0%
we will determine what is relevant to
 
00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
the question um and what is not relevant
 
00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:24.200 align:start position:0%
so these records are not turned over to
 
00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
the court process uh what is relevant is
 
00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:30.760 align:start position:0%
provided in the report as a summary um
 
00:21:32.669 --> 00:21:32.679 align:start position:0%
in forensic evaluations we're speaking
 
00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:35.320 align:start position:0%
to answering the question and as
 
00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:37.400 align:start position:0%
psychologists um
 
00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
we understand the importance of
 
00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:42.760 align:start position:0%
confidentiality but in the mental health
 
00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
process in the medical process um but at
 
00:21:49.029 --> 00:21:49.039 align:start position:0%
the same time we need to be able to form
 
00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:52.400 align:start position:0%
a a valid opinion regarding whether or
 
00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:54.520 align:start position:0%
not this individual has a mental disease
 
00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:56.480 align:start position:0%
or defect whether or not there is
 
00:21:58.990 --> 00:21:59.000 align:start position:0%
treatment that can restore them and th
 
00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:01.240 align:start position:0%
that information we need in order to
 
00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:06.440 align:start position:0%
make those opinions so um it is standard
 
00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:09.240 align:start position:0%
practice as part of a of any kind of
 
00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:12.120 align:start position:0%
psychological evaluation that we look at
 
00:22:14.549 --> 00:22:14.559 align:start position:0%
all available evidence that is
 
00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:17.000 align:start position:0%
interviewing um collateral resources as
 
00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
well so calling friends calling family
 
00:22:22.269 --> 00:22:22.279 align:start position:0%
calling neighbors um calling previous
 
00:22:25.149 --> 00:22:25.159 align:start position:0%
clinicians um it's pretty standard
 
00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
practice for evaluations and as I said
 
00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
allows us to not only have a a rich
 
00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:34.360 align:start position:0%
history but a timeline of the symptoms
 
00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
and the onset the medications that
 
00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:38.320 align:start position:0%
they're on how they present with
 
00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:40.440 align:start position:0%
different individuals if someone's
 
00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:43.320 align:start position:0%
complaining of memory issues for example
 
00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
um are those memory issues being seen by
 
00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
other individuals in other settings that
 
00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
is also important for the court to know
 
00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
and important for whether or not they
 
00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:55.640 align:start position:0%
have a mental disease or defect which is
 
00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
the question we need to answer first
 
00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
represent excuse me representative
 
00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:05.400 align:start position:0%
Manos okay so other questions rep
 
00:23:07.789 --> 00:23:07.799 align:start position:0%
representative dorenzo thank you Mr
 
00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my my
 
00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:12.520 align:start position:0%
question so are there cases where the
 
00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:14.840 align:start position:0%
behavior of the person who's going to
 
00:23:17.789 --> 00:23:17.799 align:start position:0%
court automatically triggers um an
 
00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
evaluation for instance if it's like a
 
00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:22.840 align:start position:0%
you know just a horrible horrible
 
00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:23.909 align:start position:0%
you know just a horrible horrible
criminal

00:23:23.909 --> 00:23:23.919 align:start position:0%
criminal
 
00:23:25.669 --> 00:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
type um
 
00:23:30.549 --> 00:23:30.559 align:start position:0%
thing so anyone can raise competency um
 
00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
at any point uh during the legal process
 
00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
so we sometimes will have if the
 
00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
behavior is concerning in a court
 
00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
hearing that the the the judge will
 
00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:40.840 align:start position:0%
raise the issue and request a competency
 
00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:43.240 align:start position:0%
evaluation I've had it where um
 
00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
prosecutors have also raised um had a
 
00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
conversation um in lower level incidents
 
00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:50.320 align:start position:0%
violations or misdemeanor bees and they
 
00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:52.480 align:start position:0%
have raised the concern because legally
 
00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:54.520 align:start position:0%
and ethically they need to raise that
 
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
concern so sometimes it is the behavior
 
00:23:59.669 --> 00:23:59.679 align:start position:0%
that they see sometimes times it comes
 
00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:02.440 align:start position:0%
from discussions that uh are attorney
 
00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:05.080 align:start position:0%
client privileged conversations and
 
00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:07.240 align:start position:0%
during the course of that discussion
 
00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
they realize that the client may not be
 
00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
in touch with reality or they may be so
 
00:24:15.269 --> 00:24:15.279 align:start position:0%
severely depressed and suicidal that
 
00:24:17.789 --> 00:24:17.799 align:start position:0%
they don't even care to take part in the
 
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
legal process um and so that is when
 
00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:22.200 align:start position:0%
they will raise it and they will say we
 
00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:24.440 align:start position:0%
can't move forward your honor my my
 
00:24:26.789 --> 00:24:26.799 align:start position:0%
client cannot make decisions about how
 
00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:28.720 align:start position:0%
they want to proceed in any in a
 
00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:30.430 align:start position:0%
they want to proceed in any in a
rational

00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:30.440 align:start position:0%
rational
 
00:24:33.789 --> 00:24:33.799 align:start position:0%
manner you're welcome uh yes
 
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
representative trip sorry thank you
 
00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my
 
00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:41.720 align:start position:0%
question the uh it seems that the the
 
00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
majority of the changes deal with
 
00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:45.029 align:start position:0%
majority of the changes deal with
non-incarcerated

00:24:45.029 --> 00:24:45.039 align:start position:0%
non-incarcerated
 
00:24:45.039 --> 00:24:47.230 align:start position:0%
non-incarcerated
people

00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:47.240 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
or I don't know what the proper term is
 
00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
nowadays uh are there any issues with
 
00:24:59.389 --> 00:24:59.399 align:start position:0%
the uh people that are incarcerated
 
00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
so the the records are still an issue
 
00:25:06.029 --> 00:25:06.039 align:start position:0%
for those that are um incarcerated um
 
00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
the other we have less of a no-show
 
00:25:11.669 --> 00:25:11.679 align:start position:0%
issue because most of the time um
 
00:25:13.549 --> 00:25:13.559 align:start position:0%
they're there and readily willing to
 
00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
talk to us get them out of out of their
 
00:25:18.389 --> 00:25:18.399 align:start position:0%
room for a little while um so we have
 
00:25:20.269 --> 00:25:20.279 align:start position:0%
less of a no-show rate we still do get
 
00:25:24.549 --> 00:25:24.559 align:start position:0%
some refusals um especially those who um
 
00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
maybe seriously mental eal so sometimes
 
00:25:29.149 --> 00:25:29.159 align:start position:0%
they don't show up but um the high
 
00:25:29.159 --> 00:25:30.669 align:start position:0%
they don't show up but um the high
no-show

00:25:30.669 --> 00:25:30.679 align:start position:0%
no-show
 
00:25:32.789 --> 00:25:32.799 align:start position:0%
rate I think the medical records are the
 
00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
other thing for the um for the
 
00:25:38.789 --> 00:25:38.799 align:start position:0%
incarcerated those apply to
 
00:25:42.149 --> 00:25:42.159 align:start position:0%
both follow up please follow up sure uh
 
00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
what percentage of the people requiring
 
00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:53.240 align:start position:0%
incarcerated I calculated this number
 
00:25:55.669 --> 00:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
not that long ago for someone
 
00:25:58.630 --> 00:25:58.640 align:start position:0%
um I believe if I'm Rec calling
 
00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
correctly um that my estimate over the
 
00:26:04.029 --> 00:26:04.039 align:start position:0%
last 2 years was about 30% incarcerated
 
00:26:08.269 --> 00:26:08.279 align:start position:0%
and 70% non-incarcerated is that right
 
00:26:11.149 --> 00:26:11.159 align:start position:0%
okay yep go ahead
 
00:26:16.029 --> 00:26:16.039 align:start position:0%
uh so is is this a issue with uh being
 
00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:20.240 align:start position:0%
able to go forward with the uh the trial
 
00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:23.240 align:start position:0%
yes not getting the uh evaluation yes
 
00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:25.720 align:start position:0%
everything is placed on hold until the
 
00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
court has the evaluation and the judge
 
00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:29.480 align:start position:0%
makes the determination whether or not
 
00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:32.120 align:start position:0%
someone is legally competent or if
 
00:26:34.029 --> 00:26:34.039 align:start position:0%
they're not competent then they move
 
00:26:37.029 --> 00:26:37.039 align:start position:0%
into a restoration
 
00:26:41.389 --> 00:26:41.399 align:start position:0%
period thank you other questions so I I
 
00:26:43.029 --> 00:26:43.039 align:start position:0%
guess I have oh I'm sorry representative
 
00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:47.080 align:start position:0%
Smith go ahead could you just explain
 
00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
what you mean by the road
 
00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:51.720 align:start position:0%
restoration yes so the three questions
 
00:26:53.389 --> 00:26:53.399 align:start position:0%
that we answer at the office of forensic
 
00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
examiners uh when we write a report um
 
00:26:59.630 --> 00:26:59.640 align:start position:0%
under the current statute statute is the
 
00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
first whether or not uh the individual
 
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
or expert opinion and whether or not
 
00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
they have a mental disease or disorder
 
00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:09.480 align:start position:0%
whether or not they have um
 
00:27:12.909 --> 00:27:12.919 align:start position:0%
a um factual and rational understanding
 
00:27:14.389 --> 00:27:14.399 align:start position:0%
of the legal proceedings and whether or
 
00:27:16.269 --> 00:27:16.279 align:start position:0%
not they have the ability to assist
 
00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:18.320 align:start position:0%
their attorney in their
 
00:27:21.909 --> 00:27:21.919 align:start position:0%
defense if those are lacking then we
 
00:27:23.549 --> 00:27:23.559 align:start position:0%
will make an opinion
 
00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
regarding how those deficits that they
 
00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
may have impact their legal skills and
 
00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:32.120 align:start position:0%
which skills so that the court can
 
00:27:33.549 --> 00:27:33.559 align:start position:0%
decide whether or not they're competent
 
00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
or incompetent under the current statute
 
00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:38.200 align:start position:0%
if our opinion is that the individual is
 
00:27:42.029 --> 00:27:42.039 align:start position:0%
not competent at this time um then the
 
00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
defendant is to be excuse me the
 
00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
defendant shall be ordered to
 
00:27:50.029 --> 00:27:50.039 align:start position:0%
Restoration unless there is clear and
 
00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:53.320 align:start position:0%
convincing evidence that they that it is
 
00:27:55.549 --> 00:27:55.559 align:start position:0%
unlikely or is not likely that they will
 
00:27:57.789 --> 00:27:57.799 align:start position:0%
be restored to competency in the next
 
00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:00.200 align:start position:0%
year so the office forensic examiner
 
00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:02.320 align:start position:0%
then offers an opinion on whether or not
 
00:28:04.669 --> 00:28:04.679 align:start position:0%
there is appropriate treatment that is
 
00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
likely to restore the individual in the
 
00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:10.720 align:start position:0%
next year and if that treatment uh and
 
00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
what that treatment is as far as
 
00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
treatment recommendations to take place
 
00:28:17.470 --> 00:28:17.480 align:start position:0%
in that restoration period at the end of
 
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
the restoration period then they will be
 
00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:22.240 align:start position:0%
referred back to the office of the fren
 
00:28:25.909 --> 00:28:25.919 align:start position:0%
examiners for a restoration evaluation
 
00:28:28.669 --> 00:28:28.679 align:start position:0%
at which time we will once again conduct
 
00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
a competency evaluation and offer an
 
00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:32.600 align:start position:0%
opinion as to whether or not they are
 
00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:35.320 align:start position:0%
competent and been restored or not
 
00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:38.200 align:start position:0%
competent and not restored if I could
 
00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
just follow up where does that
 
00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
restoration take
 
00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:44.600 align:start position:0%
place restoration takes place in the
 
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
community um in the majority of cases
 
00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:50.840 align:start position:0%
some restoration will take place if the
 
00:28:54.029 --> 00:28:54.039 align:start position:0%
individual if the court um deems that
 
00:28:54.039 --> 00:28:55.029 align:start position:0%
individual if the court um deems that
the

00:28:55.029 --> 00:28:55.039 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:28:58.430 --> 00:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
individual needs to remain romantic in
 
00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
the county jail um or at um the spew or
 
00:29:05.549 --> 00:29:05.559 align:start position:0%
at New Hampshire hospital thank
 
00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
you well I I guess I I have um a couple
 
00:29:11.029 --> 00:29:11.039 align:start position:0%
of questions the first question I have
 
00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:13.640 align:start position:0%
is is this um
 
00:29:16.509 --> 00:29:16.519 align:start position:0%
this is this proposal I I understand
 
00:29:18.269 --> 00:29:18.279 align:start position:0%
that it's it's sort of prompted by the
 
00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:20.120 align:start position:0%
department of corrections but has the
 
00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:21.480 align:start position:0%
Attorney General reviewed is the
 
00:29:23.789 --> 00:29:23.799 align:start position:0%
Attorney General on board with this so
 
00:29:23.799 --> 00:29:25.950 align:start position:0%
Attorney General on board with this so
to

00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:25.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:29:28.669 --> 00:29:28.679 align:start position:0%
speak um I can't speak for their office
 
00:29:31.669 --> 00:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
but we did write it um with a member of
 
00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's staff so they
 
00:29:35.789 --> 00:29:35.799 align:start position:0%
were involved in the process all right
 
00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
sure so then a couple just a couple of
 
00:29:41.789 --> 00:29:41.799 align:start position:0%
questions one um I see on um on the
 
00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
first page there's reference to uh the
 
00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:47.080 align:start position:0%
evaluations be being conducted by
 
00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
electronic means and I I have to say I'm
 
00:29:51.549 --> 00:29:51.559 align:start position:0%
I'm just a little I'm I'm just a little
 
00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
surprised that is that something that's
 
00:29:55.029 --> 00:29:55.039 align:start position:0%
being done now that you're doing
 
00:29:58.190 --> 00:29:58.200 align:start position:0%
evaluations by electronic means yes um
 
00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:04.120 align:start position:0%
um the um the pivot for that um really
 
00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
in our office changed with um covid um
 
00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
however it is a practice that has
 
00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:13.720 align:start position:0%
continued in some
 
00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
cases um and um it is a process that
 
00:30:21.029 --> 00:30:21.039 align:start position:0%
will be continuing um probably more so
 
00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:22.440 align:start position:0%
in the near future we'll be doing more
 
00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
remote evaluations there is research in
 
00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
the field um that remote evaluations um
 
00:30:31.909 --> 00:30:31.919 align:start position:0%
can be and are equal to the opinions and
 
00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:34.120 align:start position:0%
competency evaluations of those
 
00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:38.440 align:start position:0%
conducted in person um so we plan to
 
00:30:40.669 --> 00:30:40.679 align:start position:0%
continue and likely increase the amount
 
00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
of remote evaluations that will be
 
00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
occurring in the future and I'm curious
 
00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:48.200 align:start position:0%
what what has been the reaction of the
 
00:30:50.029 --> 00:30:50.039 align:start position:0%
defense bar to that are they okay with
 
00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:52.360 align:start position:0%
that or you get a lot of objections that
 
00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:55.120 align:start position:0%
you know we no we want it in person um
 
00:30:56.909 --> 00:30:56.919 align:start position:0%
no uh I don't get I wouldn't say we get
 
00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:01.240 align:start position:0%
a lot of objections um we look at I
 
00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
review evaluations before I no not
 
00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:06.360 align:start position:0%
evaluations I review records if we have
 
00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
them and I review the discovery um and I
 
00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
evaluate whether or not the case would
 
00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:13.360 align:start position:0%
be clinically appropriate I try to
 
00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
screen out those cases that are not
 
00:31:17.629 --> 00:31:17.639 align:start position:0%
clinically appropriate um those may need
 
00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:21.200 align:start position:0%
more extensive testing or those that may
 
00:31:24.789 --> 00:31:24.799 align:start position:0%
have um some specific paranoia with
 
00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:26.360 align:start position:0%
technology might be an ex the first
 
00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:29.000 align:start position:0%
example that comes to mind um and those
 
00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
typically are I don't try I don't even
 
00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
try video conference we just schedule
 
00:31:36.269 --> 00:31:36.279 align:start position:0%
for in person
 
00:31:39.149 --> 00:31:39.159 align:start position:0%
um in those cases where we have councel
 
00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:41.000 align:start position:0%
reach out and say I don't think my
 
00:31:44.549 --> 00:31:44.559 align:start position:0%
client would do well by video um then I
 
00:31:46.509 --> 00:31:46.519 align:start position:0%
respect that opinion as they know their
 
00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:47.960 align:start position:0%
client best at that point they've had
 
00:31:49.509 --> 00:31:49.519 align:start position:0%
the most interaction and we will
 
00:31:52.789 --> 00:31:52.799 align:start position:0%
schedule an iners um although there may
 
00:31:52.799 --> 00:31:53.669 align:start position:0%
schedule an iners um although there may
be

00:31:53.669 --> 00:31:53.679 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:31:56.590 --> 00:31:56.600 align:start position:0%
some changes um in the future with
 
00:31:58.350 --> 00:31:58.360 align:start position:0%
regard to how often we do that
 
00:31:59.909 --> 00:31:59.919 align:start position:0%
at this point in time we've been able to
 
00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
offer in-person
 
00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
evaluations um when needed okay then my
 
00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
final question is um am I understanding
 
00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
correctly that when with regard to the
 
00:32:12.789 --> 00:32:12.799 align:start position:0%
records issue I would
 
00:32:15.029 --> 00:32:15.039 align:start position:0%
assume that
 
00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:18.760 align:start position:0%
before a lawyer for a CL for a defendant
 
00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:22.200 align:start position:0%
would agree to records being disclosed
 
00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:23.960 align:start position:0%
that the lawyer would have looked at the
 
00:32:27.629 --> 00:32:27.639 align:start position:0%
records himself or herself to make sure
 
00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
that there's I mean I presume that that
 
00:32:33.029 --> 00:32:33.039 align:start position:0%
the lawyer would not say sure just I'm
 
00:32:34.549 --> 00:32:34.559 align:start position:0%
going to allow a release of all these
 
00:32:36.789 --> 00:32:36.799 align:start position:0%
records with not knowing what's in them
 
00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:39.480 align:start position:0%
yes typically um the records come from
 
00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:41.320 align:start position:0%
through the defense Council so even in
 
00:32:43.029 --> 00:32:43.039 align:start position:0%
those cases when there's a court order
 
00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
for us to get the records directly it
 
00:32:47.470 --> 00:32:47.480 align:start position:0%
also usually has them sent directly to
 
00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:49.320 align:start position:0%
the defense Council the the Judges
 
00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
usually put both of those in those court
 
00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:53.440 align:start position:0%
orders okay and so then the next
 
00:32:57.269 --> 00:32:57.279 align:start position:0%
question I have is is this if the I I
 
00:32:59.350 --> 00:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
have no problem at all with the idea
 
00:33:01.750 --> 00:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
that if defense you know that defense
 
00:33:03.669 --> 00:33:03.679 align:start position:0%
Council should make the decision of of
 
00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:08.200 align:start position:0%
what records should be going to
 
00:33:11.789 --> 00:33:11.799 align:start position:0%
um the forensic examiner um in the first
 
00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
instance I only um the the only question
 
00:33:17.509 --> 00:33:17.519 align:start position:0%
I have is if
 
00:33:20.629 --> 00:33:20.639 align:start position:0%
the this seems to say that that some
 
00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
records could be
 
00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
provided to the to you to conduct the
 
00:33:30.549 --> 00:33:30.559 align:start position:0%
evaluation which uh which would then not
 
00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
be disclosed to the state and I guess
 
00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:36.760 align:start position:0%
I'm that does trouble me a little bit in
 
00:33:39.789 --> 00:33:39.799 align:start position:0%
other words if you have if you have
 
00:33:42.430 --> 00:33:42.440 align:start position:0%
information that you're basing a
 
00:33:46.950 --> 00:33:46.960 align:start position:0%
decision on that is not disclosed to the
 
00:33:50.549 --> 00:33:50.559 align:start position:0%
state why that that is troubling to me
 
00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
because the defense knows about it
 
00:33:55.909 --> 00:33:55.919 align:start position:0%
obviously yes so um there are two issues
 
00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:00.720 align:start position:0%
I I so with a defense attorney um their
 
00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
role their job and their purpose is to
 
00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:05.440 align:start position:0%
defend their
 
00:34:09.389 --> 00:34:09.399 align:start position:0%
client if we presume that they have
 
00:34:11.950 --> 00:34:11.960 align:start position:0%
reviewed the records and released to us
 
00:34:13.950 --> 00:34:13.960 align:start position:0%
the records that they believe to be
 
00:34:19.149 --> 00:34:19.159 align:start position:0%
relevant or um would
 
00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh present their client in a light that
 
00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:26.720 align:start position:0%
helps them which is their job is to is
 
00:34:28.149 --> 00:34:28.159 align:start position:0%
to help their client and work for their
 
00:34:31.669 --> 00:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
client then we may miss important
 
00:34:34.149 --> 00:34:34.159 align:start position:0%
information um
 
00:34:37.869 --> 00:34:37.879 align:start position:0%
that may not serve their purposes of
 
00:34:39.430 --> 00:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
defending their client to the best of
 
00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:41.560 align:start position:0%
their ability because they have ethical
 
00:34:46.349 --> 00:34:46.359 align:start position:0%
and obligation to their client so I am
 
00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
um leery to say that I want all records
 
00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:52.720 align:start position:0%
approved by defense counsel before they
 
00:34:54.389 --> 00:34:54.399 align:start position:0%
send them to me now there are times
 
00:34:56.430 --> 00:34:56.440 align:start position:0%
where I get records that have been
 
00:34:58.870 --> 00:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
redacted and I let the court know that
 
00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
those records were redacted because it
 
00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
limits my opinion I don't know what they
 
00:35:05.950 --> 00:35:05.960 align:start position:0%
redacted or why it was reacted did they
 
00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:07.640 align:start position:0%
redact some information that maybe
 
00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
speaks to dangerousness which is an
 
00:35:11.829 --> 00:35:11.839 align:start position:0%
issue that I have to address if they are
 
00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
found not competent and not restorable
 
00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
under State V Lavoy so I am somewhat
 
00:35:18.589 --> 00:35:18.599 align:start position:0%
leery to say that I want all records to
 
00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
be approved by defense although I do
 
00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
agree that if if those records were sent
 
00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
directly to us that the defense
 
00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
Council should have the ability to ask
 
00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:35.000 align:start position:0%
the court for those records to be
 
00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
provided to them as well if it was not
 
00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:39.240 align:start position:0%
already because they should have access
 
00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
to the same information regarding their
 
00:35:44.069 --> 00:35:44.079 align:start position:0%
client um as from an forensic examiner
 
00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
standpoint I don't have a problem with
 
00:35:47.230 --> 00:35:47.240 align:start position:0%
them having the confidential information
 
00:35:49.309 --> 00:35:49.319 align:start position:0%
about their client whether or not
 
00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:51.200 align:start position:0%
prosecution gets access to that that is
 
00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
a question for the court that is not
 
00:35:55.109 --> 00:35:55.119 align:start position:0%
something that we would be releasing we
 
00:35:58.790 --> 00:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
do not release any records any reports
 
00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
anything without a direct order from the
 
00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:05.240 align:start position:0%
court okay so you and I'm sorry I I know
 
00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:06.640 align:start position:0%
I I understand what you're saying I mean
 
00:36:08.069 --> 00:36:08.079 align:start position:0%
I do agree with you that the defense
 
00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
Council shouldn't be able to you know if
 
00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:12.150 align:start position:0%
Council shouldn't be able to you know if
there's

00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:36:15.589 --> 00:36:15.599 align:start position:0%
some very unfavorable information in the
 
00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
medical records about violence or
 
00:36:20.030 --> 00:36:20.040 align:start position:0%
something like that the the defense
 
00:36:21.589 --> 00:36:21.599 align:start position:0%
Council shouldn't be able to hide that
 
00:36:24.670 --> 00:36:24.680 align:start position:0%
from you in making a a determination but
 
00:36:29.109 --> 00:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
I guess what I was sort of saying is
 
00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
um if whatever information you receive
 
00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
whatever information you base a decision
 
00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
on it's hard for me to understand why
 
00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
that information shouldn't be available
 
00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
then to both
 
00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:47.440 align:start position:0%
sides oh that's sort of above my pay
 
00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:49.390 align:start position:0%
sides oh that's sort of above my pay
grade

00:36:49.390 --> 00:36:49.400 align:start position:0%
grade
 
00:36:53.349 --> 00:36:53.359 align:start position:0%
um um that uh I mean that is a that's a
 
00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:55.000 align:start position:0%
Judicial that's a that is a question
 
00:36:57.630 --> 00:36:57.640 align:start position:0%
that goes to the judge um of whether or
 
00:36:59.430 --> 00:36:59.440 align:start position:0%
not that information should be provided
 
00:37:03.309 --> 00:37:03.319 align:start position:0%
to to both parties that is as a forensic
 
00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
examiner I am an independent evaluator
 
00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
tasked with providing information to the
 
00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:10.040 align:start position:0%
court the legal questions beside the
 
00:37:11.470 --> 00:37:11.480 align:start position:0%
lawyers of who should have what
 
00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
information what is admissible what is
 
00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:15.800 align:start position:0%
here say those are questions that we
 
00:37:19.589 --> 00:37:19.599 align:start position:0%
then as examiners defer to the
 
00:37:24.069 --> 00:37:24.079 align:start position:0%
court um I will add okay that particular
 
00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
language um we there is an objection
 
00:37:29.829 --> 00:37:29.839 align:start position:0%
with the original way that this bill was
 
00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
written by the defense Lawyers
 
00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
Association um we sat down me being the
 
00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections with um
 
00:37:41.710 --> 00:37:41.720 align:start position:0%
Senator Chanley and the ACLU and the New
 
00:37:43.990 --> 00:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire defense attorneys to kind of
 
00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:46.760 align:start position:0%
come up language that they would agree
 
00:37:48.829 --> 00:37:48.839 align:start position:0%
to yeah the only thing I mean the thing
 
00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
I guess the thing that concerns me is
 
00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:54.640 align:start position:0%
the maybe the last sentence in paragraph
 
00:37:58.270 --> 00:37:58.280 align:start position:0%
e about um the court
 
00:38:00.589 --> 00:38:00.599 align:start position:0%
consider the C the person's privacy
 
00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:02.920 align:start position:0%
interest in the content of the
 
00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:05.670 align:start position:0%
interest in the content of the
records

00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
records
 
00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
um and I I mean I I guess my concern is
 
00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
if you've how what however strong the
 
00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:14.920 align:start position:0%
person's privacy interest in the records
 
00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:16.720 align:start position:0%
may be that might be a reason for those
 
00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:19.560 align:start position:0%
records not to be given to you but if
 
00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
they are given to you then it you know
 
00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
it and then presumably that goes into
 
00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
your evaluation and if that's you know
 
00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
if that's true it's hard for me to
 
00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
understand why those records then should
 
00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
sides I understand what you're saying I
 
00:38:45.589 --> 00:38:45.599 align:start position:0%
think that those aren't records that we
 
00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
would provide without a court order now
 
00:38:49.109 --> 00:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
so that it's not changing sure I don't
 
00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
know I understand I mean I can
 
00:38:51.309 --> 00:38:51.319 align:start position:0%
understand you would want a court order
 
00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:52.760 align:start position:0%
but I'm just sort of saying that you
 
00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:54.200 align:start position:0%
know to the extent that this would say
 
00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:55.720 align:start position:0%
to the court
 
00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
well um the Privacy interest
 
00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:02.720 align:start position:0%
um I mean it would seem to me that to
 
00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:04.160 align:start position:0%
the extent there's a privacy interest
 
00:39:05.829 --> 00:39:05.839 align:start position:0%
that the court should be considering
 
00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
that initially as to whether or not you
 
00:39:10.829 --> 00:39:10.839 align:start position:0%
you get the records at all but once you
 
00:39:12.069 --> 00:39:12.079 align:start position:0%
do get the
 
00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
records it you know I can see some
 
00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
unfairness in in those records being
 
00:39:18.510 --> 00:39:18.520 align:start position:0%
available only to one side I will say
 
00:39:20.430 --> 00:39:20.440 align:start position:0%
that that is um an argument that I have
 
00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
seen come across um in motions um from
 
00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
the prosecution teams um and that um
 
00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:29.240 align:start position:0%
that is current being discussed in
 
00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
courts across the state okay all right
 
00:39:34.109 --> 00:39:34.119 align:start position:0%
well anyway I mean that's that that's a
 
00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
we can sort of TW tweak the language a
 
00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
little bit I think probably all right
 
00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:42.760 align:start position:0%
any other questions yes representa
 
00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:46.040 align:start position:0%
Lorenzo who pays for all of
 
00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:49.480 align:start position:0%
this we do do you mean this um
 
00:39:52.349 --> 00:39:52.359 align:start position:0%
evaluations does it the evaluations um
 
00:39:55.990 --> 00:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
so the office of forensic examiner is um
 
00:39:58.349 --> 00:39:58.359 align:start position:0%
funded through the New Hampshire
 
00:40:01.309 --> 00:40:01.319 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections at this time
 
00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
yes and we're primarily a general funded
 
00:40:06.589 --> 00:40:06.599 align:start position:0%
organization so followup please so this
 
00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't um hit the um the client's
 
00:40:12.589 --> 00:40:12.599 align:start position:0%
health insurance or anything we're not b
 
00:40:16.109 --> 00:40:16.119 align:start position:0%
no okay thank you other
 
00:40:18.270 --> 00:40:18.280 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very

what was that initially I had objection
 
00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:10.720 align:start position:0%
but what she said and I think she was
 
00:41:14.069 --> 00:41:14.079 align:start position:0%
very sincere and genuine she body she
 
00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't share any of this stuff yeah it
 
00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
only goes into her report and once her
 
00:41:21.309 --> 00:41:21.319 align:start position:0%
report is done that's it and
 
00:41:23.950 --> 00:41:23.960 align:start position:0%

harassment on Sports officials and uh
obviously

00:47:55.230 --> 00:47:55.240 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
00:47:58.030 --> 00:47:58.040 align:start position:0%
uh having been involved in athletics all
 
00:48:01.069 --> 00:48:01.079 align:start position:0%
of my life as a player a coach and as a
 
00:48:03.829 --> 00:48:03.839 align:start position:0%
teacher I've seen what's happening in in
 
00:48:06.309 --> 00:48:06.319 align:start position:0%
the sports world and it's very
 
00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:09.440 align:start position:0%
disturbing the the way uh officials are
 
00:48:11.549 --> 00:48:11.559 align:start position:0%
treated the language that's used in in
 
00:48:14.990 --> 00:48:15.000 align:start position:0%
the stands by by individuals and really
 
00:48:18.349 --> 00:48:18.359 align:start position:0%
the the behavior that that takes place
 
00:48:20.910 --> 00:48:20.920 align:start position:0%
which totally takes away from the game
 
00:48:25.150 --> 00:48:25.160 align:start position:0%
itself these these games were were were
 
00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
organized for the enjoyment of the
 
00:48:28.750 --> 00:48:28.760 align:start position:0%
players so that they could play for the
 
00:48:30.549 --> 00:48:30.559 align:start position:0%
enjoyment of the fans so that they could
 
00:48:33.950 --> 00:48:33.960 align:start position:0%
enjoy uh the the spec from a spectator's
 
00:48:36.870 --> 00:48:36.880 align:start position:0%
standpoint watching the the game as it
 
00:48:39.870 --> 00:48:39.880 align:start position:0%
it it proceeds and what's happened is
 
00:48:41.549 --> 00:48:41.559 align:start position:0%
chaos has enter the
 
00:48:44.710 --> 00:48:44.720 align:start position:0%
situation and uh it it's very disturbing
 
00:48:47.230 --> 00:48:47.240 align:start position:0%
to me as I said as a player and and as a
 
00:48:50.030 --> 00:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
coach a to to to see what's going on to
 
00:48:52.390 --> 00:48:52.400 align:start position:0%
see the to see and hear the language
 
00:48:55.549 --> 00:48:55.559 align:start position:0%
that's that's being used by fans and and
 
00:48:59.069 --> 00:48:59.079 align:start position:0%
some of these fans it's it's it's very
 
00:49:02.109 --> 00:49:02.119 align:start position:0%
very disturbing and my grandchildren uh
 
00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
have been players and I've gone to their
 
00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
games and uh you can see this happening
 
00:49:11.390 --> 00:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
and it's it's it's just uh it's it's a
 
00:49:12.510 --> 00:49:12.520 align:start position:0%
very bad
 
00:49:14.589 --> 00:49:14.599 align:start position:0%
thing it's an example of what's
 
00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:16.440 align:start position:0%
happening to the society I think the
 
00:49:19.549 --> 00:49:19.559 align:start position:0%
society is be becoming more corrupted
 
00:49:22.349 --> 00:49:22.359 align:start position:0%
chaotic and that disturbs me so what's
 
00:49:23.950 --> 00:49:23.960 align:start position:0%
the way to deal with it well the way to
 
00:49:26.190 --> 00:49:26.200 align:start position:0%
deal with it in my opinion is to create
 
00:49:28.430 --> 00:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
a piece of legislation that protects the
 
00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
official think of this young kid who
 
00:49:33.510 --> 00:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
want who's uh who's learning to be an
 
00:49:36.309 --> 00:49:36.319 align:start position:0%
official who who's working a game and
 
00:49:39.589 --> 00:49:39.599 align:start position:0%
who's who's just totally harassed by
 
00:49:43.069 --> 00:49:43.079 align:start position:0%
some individual from the STS uh or some
 
00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
individual and and this loses their
 
00:49:47.589 --> 00:49:47.599 align:start position:0%
interest in being an official you know
 
00:49:49.549 --> 00:49:49.559 align:start position:0%
how difficult it is to find an official
 
00:49:53.870 --> 00:49:53.880 align:start position:0%
today someone to officiate a game so
 
00:49:56.309 --> 00:49:56.319 align:start position:0%
uh brought this piece of legislation
 
00:49:56.319 --> 00:49:57.630 align:start position:0%
uh brought this piece of legislation
forward

00:49:57.630 --> 00:49:57.640 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:49:59.710 --> 00:49:59.720 align:start position:0%
and uh talks about the event the
 
00:50:02.829 --> 00:50:02.839 align:start position:0%
participant the event the official and
 
00:50:04.589 --> 00:50:04.599 align:start position:0%
the person who commits the first-degree
 
00:50:06.510 --> 00:50:06.520 align:start position:0%
assault there was a penalty associated
 
00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
with this and I've been asked this
 
00:50:11.190 --> 00:50:11.200 align:start position:0%
numerous times who's going to oversee
 
00:50:13.390 --> 00:50:13.400 align:start position:0%
all of this well for every athletic
 
00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
event there there's an administrative
 
00:50:17.630 --> 00:50:17.640 align:start position:0%
person who usually puts the event
 
00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
together it's someone from someone from
 
00:50:21.990 --> 00:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
the school and it's certainly at the
 
00:50:24.150 --> 00:50:24.160 align:start position:0%
postsecondary level at somebody from
 
00:50:26.950 --> 00:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
from the college so so indeed there is
 
00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
there is uh a way to to mootor to this
 
00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:33.240 align:start position:0%
so with that Mr shamman I thank you so
 
00:50:35.230 --> 00:50:35.240 align:start position:0%
much for allowing me to come and testify
 
00:50:37.109 --> 00:50:37.119 align:start position:0%
I'll try to address any questions that
 
00:50:39.789 --> 00:50:39.799 align:start position:0%
you you you may have and got a call
 
00:50:42.990 --> 00:50:43.000 align:start position:0%
yesterday from ESPN about this so it's
 
00:50:45.950 --> 00:50:45.960 align:start position:0%
gravitating across the country this is
 
00:50:48.349 --> 00:50:48.359 align:start position:0%
not just in New Hampshire the kind of
 
00:50:49.750 --> 00:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
behavior that we're seeing and I'll give
 
00:50:51.789 --> 00:50:51.799 align:start position:0%
you two illustrations that were very
 
00:50:54.670 --> 00:50:54.680 align:start position:0%
disturbing to me the young woman who
 
00:50:56.990 --> 00:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
plays for the University of Iowa the the
 
00:51:00.630 --> 00:51:00.640 align:start position:0%
scoring leader of of the world
 
00:51:04.309 --> 00:51:04.319 align:start position:0%
U after she made a basket the uh you
 
00:51:05.470 --> 00:51:05.480 align:start position:0%
know the the
 
00:51:09.109 --> 00:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
crowd ran onto the floor and knocked her
 
00:51:12.390 --> 00:51:12.400 align:start position:0%
over she could have had a permanent
 
00:51:15.190 --> 00:51:15.200 align:start position:0%
injury just because of this crazy
 
00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
behavior then I watched the Duke game
 
00:51:20.349 --> 00:51:20.359 align:start position:0%
when Duke was playing uh I think they
 
00:51:21.990 --> 00:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
might have been playing Wake Forest the
 
00:51:24.910 --> 00:51:24.920 align:start position:0%
same things happened and a Duke player
 
00:51:28.950 --> 00:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
went went down now there's no there's no
 
00:51:31.789 --> 00:51:31.799 align:start position:0%
need for that I understand enthusiasm
 
00:51:33.510 --> 00:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
and so forth and so on but these are
 
00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:35.200 align:start position:0%
graphic illustrations of what's
 
00:51:38.750 --> 00:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
happening the chaos that's entering uh
 
00:51:42.829 --> 00:51:42.839 align:start position:0%
our athletic C tests uh so I think there
 
00:51:45.390 --> 00:51:45.400 align:start position:0%
something has to be has to be done about
 
00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
it so with that I'll try to address any
 
00:51:49.870 --> 00:51:49.880 align:start position:0%
queries that you may have and thank you
 
00:51:51.670 --> 00:51:51.680 align:start position:0%
so much for your attention appreciate it
 
00:51:55.789 --> 00:51:55.799 align:start position:0%
thank you judge no thank you and I uh
 
00:51:57.670 --> 00:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
are there questions I have to say senat
 
00:51:59.270 --> 00:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
I I applaud you if I think this you're
 
00:52:01.349 --> 00:52:01.359 align:start position:0%
ABS I agree with everything you've said
 
00:52:03.910 --> 00:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
and uh you're going to get you're going
 
00:52:05.789 --> 00:52:05.799 align:start position:0%
to get my vote that's for sure but
 
00:52:07.710 --> 00:52:07.720 align:start position:0%
questions uh for for members of the
 
00:52:11.589 --> 00:52:11.599 align:start position:0%
committee just just mine too um I mean
 
00:52:13.349 --> 00:52:13.359 align:start position:0%
guess this is a bill focused on this one
 
00:52:14.829 --> 00:52:14.839 align:start position:0%
issue but there's a slightly larger
 
00:52:18.510 --> 00:52:18.520 align:start position:0%
issue too where um people well I guess
 
00:52:20.829 --> 00:52:20.839 align:start position:0%
everybody present in the event is is a
 
00:52:22.589 --> 00:52:22.599 align:start position:0%
participant under this definition where
 
00:52:23.589 --> 00:52:23.599 align:start position:0%
people who
 
00:52:27.630 --> 00:52:27.640 align:start position:0%
are uh Spectators assault uh players or
 
00:52:29.069 --> 00:52:29.079 align:start position:0%
coaches too because they disagree what
 
00:52:32.430 --> 00:52:32.440 align:start position:0%
they're doing so would um just why did
 
00:52:34.950 --> 00:52:34.960 align:start position:0%
you focus the B on this one issue which
 
00:52:36.589 --> 00:52:36.599 align:start position:0%
is which is fine but I guess I don't
 
00:52:38.349 --> 00:52:38.359 align:start position:0%
know whether want to speak to that
 
00:52:39.829 --> 00:52:39.839 align:start position:0%
larger issue at all sure well thank you
 
00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:42.640 align:start position:0%
for the question I I I think Behavior
 
00:52:46.870 --> 00:52:46.880 align:start position:0%
per se is really out out of bounds I I
 
00:52:49.150 --> 00:52:49.160 align:start position:0%
think people people don't understand
 
00:52:51.910 --> 00:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
that when they buy a ticket to the venue
 
00:52:55.069 --> 00:52:55.079 align:start position:0%
they bought a ticket to watch a contest
 
00:52:57.030 --> 00:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
they're not participants
 
00:52:59.510 --> 00:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
right they can cheer from the sidelines
 
00:53:01.950 --> 00:53:01.960 align:start position:0%
but but but they they're not calling the
 
00:53:04.510 --> 00:53:04.520 align:start position:0%
place and and and they're
 
00:53:07.270 --> 00:53:07.280 align:start position:0%
not going after a person who might make
 
00:53:09.230 --> 00:53:09.240 align:start position:0%
a mistake or something of that nature
 
00:53:10.950 --> 00:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
but they're participant that's what this
 
00:53:13.589 --> 00:53:13.599 align:start position:0%
listen this is not the Roman
 
00:53:17.069 --> 00:53:17.079 align:start position:0%
Coliseum this the these supposedly are
 
00:53:19.710 --> 00:53:19.720 align:start position:0%
games you know and I participated in
 
00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
these games as as a youngster as a
 
00:53:24.430 --> 00:53:24.440 align:start position:0%
college player I played a little
 
00:53:26.510 --> 00:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
professionally but this whole thing is
 
00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:28.720 align:start position:0%
has gotten gotten way just way out of
 
00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
hand and I I I noticed that in in arenas
 
00:53:35.349 --> 00:53:35.359 align:start position:0%
now they when when there's a time out
 
00:53:37.950 --> 00:53:37.960 align:start position:0%
they they have people who line up along
 
00:53:40.710 --> 00:53:40.720 align:start position:0%
along the sidelines well that's from the
 
00:53:42.430 --> 00:53:42.440 align:start position:0%
professional standpoint from the
 
00:53:44.829 --> 00:53:44.839 align:start position:0%
congression when you get down to the to
 
00:53:46.950 --> 00:53:46.960 align:start position:0%
the to the uh you know postsecondary
 
00:53:50.870 --> 00:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
level uh there are efforts to control
 
00:53:54.069 --> 00:53:54.079 align:start position:0%
the crows it it's a it's it's at now
 
00:53:56.190 --> 00:53:56.200 align:start position:0%
it's at the lowest level I mean it's
 
00:53:58.870 --> 00:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
high school and Junior High
 
00:54:02.430 --> 00:54:02.440 align:start position:0%
School it it's it's amazing to me and I
 
00:54:05.950 --> 00:54:05.960 align:start position:0%
I I went to many athletic many athletic
 
00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
contexts and I still go to them and uh
 
00:54:11.270 --> 00:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
as I said I see the behavior the
 
00:54:14.309 --> 00:54:14.319 align:start position:0%
language kills me I I mean I can't
 
00:54:16.390 --> 00:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
believe I can't believe some of the
 
00:54:19.230 --> 00:54:19.240 align:start position:0%
language that's thrown around
 
00:54:22.030 --> 00:54:22.040 align:start position:0%
but I think it's a societal question we
 
00:54:24.030 --> 00:54:24.040 align:start position:0%
got to get a hold of uh representative
 
00:54:27.109 --> 00:54:27.119 align:start position:0%
Smith and then representative k
 
00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
um thank you Senator I think everybody
 
00:54:33.030 --> 00:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
agrees with you about the problem I if I
 
00:54:35.870 --> 00:54:35.880 align:start position:0%
could would like to uh find a way to add
 
00:54:39.190 --> 00:54:39.200 align:start position:0%
an amendment about the language in the
 
00:54:41.630 --> 00:54:41.640 align:start position:0%
uh used in the New Hampshire House of
 
00:54:43.950 --> 00:54:43.960 align:start position:0%
Representatives but I'm not going to ask
 
00:54:46.430 --> 00:54:46.440 align:start position:0%
that that you agree to that kind of an
 
00:54:49.549 --> 00:54:49.559 align:start position:0%
amendment um I'm glad you're laughing I
 
00:54:53.390 --> 00:54:53.400 align:start position:0%
don't laugh when I hear um my question
 
00:54:57.109 --> 00:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
is do you really believe
 
00:54:58.910 --> 00:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
that providing
 
00:55:04.549 --> 00:55:04.559 align:start position:0%
penalties for that behavior will in fact
 
00:55:08.789 --> 00:55:08.799 align:start position:0%
make a difference when you so eloquently
 
00:55:08.799 --> 00:55:09.750 align:start position:0%
make a difference when you so eloquently
have

00:55:09.750 --> 00:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:55:13.829 --> 00:55:13.839 align:start position:0%
explained the change in the culture that
 
00:55:17.030 --> 00:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
we are now suffering
 
00:55:19.150 --> 00:55:19.160 align:start position:0%
through thank you thank you for those
 
00:55:22.270 --> 00:55:22.280 align:start position:0%
comments excellent C sure do do I think
 
00:55:25.510 --> 00:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
it it'll help because every time you
 
00:55:28.029 --> 00:55:28.039 align:start position:0%
present a a a penalty there is some
 
00:55:30.510 --> 00:55:30.520 align:start position:0%
reaction to it but will the masses react
 
00:55:33.309 --> 00:55:33.319 align:start position:0%
to it in a positive fashion I I I
 
00:55:36.069 --> 00:55:36.079 align:start position:0%
honestly don't know I I think we we we
 
00:55:40.270 --> 00:55:40.280 align:start position:0%
need to we need to change Behavior
 
00:55:43.109 --> 00:55:43.119 align:start position:0%
pths people now perceive that these
 
00:55:47.190 --> 00:55:47.200 align:start position:0%
things are okay they aren't they aren't
 
00:55:49.829 --> 00:55:49.839 align:start position:0%
okay and I I give you the perfect
 
00:55:52.829 --> 00:55:52.839 align:start position:0%
example of it's not okay the incident
 
00:55:55.309 --> 00:55:55.319 align:start position:0%
that took place at Gillette Stadium
 
00:55:58.549 --> 00:55:58.559 align:start position:0%
where two people went at each other uh
 
00:55:58.559 --> 00:55:59.510 align:start position:0%
where two people went at each other uh
over

00:55:59.510 --> 00:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
over
 
00:56:02.950 --> 00:56:02.960 align:start position:0%
over over something that had no meaning
 
00:56:07.470 --> 00:56:07.480 align:start position:0%
at all and and the guy ends up
 
00:56:10.029 --> 00:56:10.039 align:start position:0%
dying well what the hell are we talking
 
00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:12.640 align:start position:0%
about we we supposedly go to these
 
00:56:16.029 --> 00:56:16.039 align:start position:0%
contests a because we enjoy watching the
 
00:56:18.510 --> 00:56:18.520 align:start position:0%
activity and we enjoy being with our
 
00:56:21.510 --> 00:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
friends and and family take take my take
 
00:56:23.230 --> 00:56:23.240 align:start position:0%
your kids or your grandchildren to a
 
00:56:25.950 --> 00:56:25.960 align:start position:0%
games so they'll they'll enjoy it and
 
00:56:28.630 --> 00:56:28.640 align:start position:0%
then have something like like this
 
00:56:31.829 --> 00:56:31.839 align:start position:0%
happen that I mean it's it's terrible
 
00:56:33.710 --> 00:56:33.720 align:start position:0%
we're get we're just getting way out of
 
00:56:38.029 --> 00:56:38.039 align:start position:0%
hand in in again in my opinion and and
 
00:56:40.069 --> 00:56:40.079 align:start position:0%
and and as the representative Smith
 
00:56:42.910 --> 00:56:42.920 align:start position:0%
points out it's it's behavior in this
 
00:56:45.990 --> 00:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
legislature I've been here a long time I
 
00:56:48.549 --> 00:56:48.559 align:start position:0%
remember when this was a pretty good
 
00:56:51.510 --> 00:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
place when people really respected one
 
00:56:54.270 --> 00:56:54.280 align:start position:0%
another and respected one another's
 
00:56:58.630 --> 00:56:58.640 align:start position:0%
views uh and and accept him uh that's
 
00:57:00.870 --> 00:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
that's maybe moving in in the the
 
00:57:02.309 --> 00:57:02.319 align:start position:0%
opposite direction but this deals with
 
00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
one aspect one aspect of is it going to
 
00:57:07.630 --> 00:57:07.640 align:start position:0%
change society no but is it an attempt
 
00:57:10.109 --> 00:57:10.119 align:start position:0%
to make it better yes and that's what
 
00:57:11.990 --> 00:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
we're here for to try to make things
 
00:57:14.750 --> 00:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
better representative
 
00:57:16.990 --> 00:57:17.000 align:start position:0%
katat thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:57:19.829 --> 00:57:19.839 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question Senator de de
 
00:57:21.630 --> 00:57:21.640 align:start position:0%
Sandro and for putting in the bill I
 
00:57:23.870 --> 00:57:23.880 align:start position:0%
just have one question so the example
 
00:57:26.390 --> 00:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
that you had mentioned relative to the
 
00:57:29.029 --> 00:57:29.039 align:start position:0%
sports players being knocked over from
 
00:57:31.029 --> 00:57:31.039 align:start position:0%
people from the stands coming in I
 
00:57:33.950 --> 00:57:33.960 align:start position:0%
noticed that this bill is limited only
 
00:57:36.430 --> 00:57:36.440 align:start position:0%
to the harassment of sports officials
 
00:57:38.750 --> 00:57:38.760 align:start position:0%
and I was wondering if you would be open
 
00:57:42.190 --> 00:57:42.200 align:start position:0%
potentially to amending to also include
 
00:57:44.950 --> 00:57:44.960 align:start position:0%
just the assault in in if you would be
 
00:57:47.789 --> 00:57:47.799 align:start position:0%
supportive of amending to
 
00:57:50.870 --> 00:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
include the assault of I guess players
 
00:57:52.910 --> 00:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
as well since that also seems to be or
 
00:57:54.670 --> 00:57:54.680 align:start position:0%
even other fans in the stand I mean it
 
00:57:56.789 --> 00:57:56.799 align:start position:0%
just seems like you know none of this
 
00:57:58.150 --> 00:57:58.160 align:start position:0%
Behavior should be allowed especially
 
00:58:00.309 --> 00:58:00.319 align:start position:0%
when it's rising to the level of of
 
00:58:02.710 --> 00:58:02.720 align:start position:0%
assault sure thank you thank you for the
 
00:58:05.910 --> 00:58:05.920 align:start position:0%
cage sure sure I think you're you're
 
00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
exactly correct the thing is how far can
 
00:58:10.670 --> 00:58:10.680 align:start position:0%
we go I I think we we got a tail of
 
00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
something that that we can actually deal
 
00:58:17.109 --> 00:58:17.119 align:start position:0%
with and uh you're absolutely right in
 
00:58:17.119 --> 00:58:18.150 align:start position:0%
with and uh you're absolutely right in
terms

00:58:18.150 --> 00:58:18.160 align:start position:0%
terms
 
00:58:20.670 --> 00:58:20.680 align:start position:0%
of anything that makes a piece of
 
00:58:24.789 --> 00:58:24.799 align:start position:0%
legislation better uh and that makes it
 
00:58:27.549 --> 00:58:27.559 align:start position:0%
work I I I think you know that's why am
 
00:58:29.470 --> 00:58:29.480 align:start position:0%
that's why we amend bills and that's why
 
00:58:31.470 --> 00:58:31.480 align:start position:0%
we have these meetings that's why we we
 
00:58:33.829 --> 00:58:33.839 align:start position:0%
have conversation about the bill so that
 
00:58:35.990 --> 00:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
we get input from others as how do how
 
00:58:38.309 --> 00:58:38.319 align:start position:0%
can we make the bill better and make it
 
00:58:40.589 --> 00:58:40.599 align:start position:0%
more effective and I think I appreciate
 
00:58:42.349 --> 00:58:42.359 align:start position:0%
your comments I think they're very
 
00:58:44.190 --> 00:58:44.200 align:start position:0%
worthwhile representative
 
00:58:46.549 --> 00:58:46.559 align:start position:0%
Manos thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:58:48.870 --> 00:58:48.880 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I'm wondering
 
00:58:54.510 --> 00:58:54.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:58.789 --> 00:58:58.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:00.069 --> 00:59:00.079 align:start position:0%
and how do
 
00:59:00.079 --> 00:59:04.309 align:start position:0%
and how do
you

00:59:04.309 --> 00:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:06.470 --> 00:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
do of an
 
00:59:10.190 --> 00:59:10.200 align:start position:0%
official being phal and and I'm
 
00:59:13.789 --> 00:59:13.799 align:start position:0%
wondering about wisdom of including
 
00:59:13.799 --> 00:59:15.109 align:start position:0%
wondering about wisdom of including
verbal

00:59:15.109 --> 00:59:15.119 align:start position:0%
verbal
 
00:59:17.390 --> 00:59:17.400 align:start position:0%
Behavior well thank you for the comments
 
00:59:19.670 --> 00:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um verbal
 
00:59:23.029 --> 00:59:23.039 align:start position:0%
Behavior can be pretty assaulting you
 
00:59:25.510 --> 00:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
know uh and I'm sure you've witnessed
 
00:59:26.670 --> 00:59:26.680 align:start position:0%
some of it
 
00:59:30.630 --> 00:59:30.640 align:start position:0%
as as I have uh I'm going to kill you I
 
00:59:32.950 --> 00:59:32.960 align:start position:0%
mean who wait a minute you know and then
 
00:59:34.750 --> 00:59:34.760 align:start position:0%
you find out that the person's got a gun
 
00:59:38.349 --> 00:59:38.359 align:start position:0%
and they shoot you that's happened you
 
00:59:40.750 --> 00:59:40.760 align:start position:0%
know and and again let me just give you
 
00:59:43.750 --> 00:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
the example that's most disturbing to me
 
00:59:46.829 --> 00:59:46.839 align:start position:0%
the Kansas City Chiefs won the Super
 
00:59:50.069 --> 00:59:50.079 align:start position:0%
Bowl they have a huge rally about
 
00:59:53.630 --> 00:59:53.640 align:start position:0%
800,000 people gathered in Kansas City
 
00:59:57.150 --> 00:59:57.160 align:start position:0%
to celebrate it some did with pulls out
 
01:00:00.910 --> 01:00:00.920 align:start position:0%
a gun and starts shooting
 
01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:02.870 align:start position:0%
a gun and starts shooting
people

01:00:02.870 --> 01:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
U what think think of that now now I I
 
01:00:09.190 --> 01:00:09.200 align:start position:0%
look at the news every evening and try
 
01:00:10.589 --> 01:00:10.599 align:start position:0%
to read the paper in the morning and and
 
01:00:12.710 --> 01:00:12.720 align:start position:0%
I look at the number of activities like
 
01:00:14.990 --> 01:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
this that are taking place around the
 
01:00:17.589 --> 01:00:17.599 align:start position:0%
country that these aren't a athletically
 
01:00:20.109 --> 01:00:20.119 align:start position:0%
oriented but that one that I've cited is
 
01:00:22.750 --> 01:00:22.760 align:start position:0%
a particular athletic I I think we're
 
01:00:23.950 --> 01:00:23.960 align:start position:0%
getting that we're getting a little bit
 
01:00:27.430 --> 01:00:27.440 align:start position:0%
out of control and
 
01:00:30.150 --> 01:00:30.160 align:start position:0%
meaning uh meaningful uh meaningful
 
01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
accusations of meaningful languag is uh
 
01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
it could be very disturbing it could be
 
01:00:38.789 --> 01:00:38.799 align:start position:0%
very disturbing we we can't control
 
01:00:41.549 --> 01:00:41.559 align:start position:0%
everything so let's cut out a piece that
 
01:00:43.950 --> 01:00:43.960 align:start position:0%
we think we could work on it and try to
 
01:00:44.950 --> 01:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
make it
 
01:00:46.990 --> 01:00:47.000 align:start position:0%
better representative trip did you have
 
01:00:51.109 --> 01:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
a question uh representative kab jumped
 
01:00:56.029 --> 01:00:56.039 align:start position:0%
it okay representative orgon um this is
 
01:00:58.670 --> 01:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
slightly larger question but um I know
 
01:01:01.589 --> 01:01:01.599 align:start position:0%
since you been involved with un Sports
 
01:01:03.670 --> 01:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
even after your outstanding performance
 
01:01:06.670 --> 01:01:06.680 align:start position:0%
on the field and um and of course one of
 
01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:08.640 align:start position:0%
the things that a lot of the you know
 
01:01:10.390 --> 01:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
the children's Sports the parents are
 
01:01:12.190 --> 01:01:12.200 align:start position:0%
often convinced that their kids are on
 
01:01:15.270 --> 01:01:15.280 align:start position:0%
their way to a college college
 
01:01:17.870 --> 01:01:17.880 align:start position:0%
scholarship or even a pro career but is
 
01:01:22.150 --> 01:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
it probably fair to say that no one's uh
 
01:01:25.430 --> 01:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
no one's career potential future career
 
01:01:27.510 --> 01:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
in college Pro Sports ever depends on
 
01:01:30.390 --> 01:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
just one call that some amateur official
 
01:01:32.270 --> 01:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
makes during a youth game and also just
 
01:01:35.829 --> 01:01:35.839 align:start position:0%
on on a uh thank you for the
 
01:01:37.870 --> 01:01:37.880 align:start position:0%
question yeah sure you could never
 
01:01:40.150 --> 01:01:40.160 align:start position:0%
attribute success or failure to that
 
01:01:43.510 --> 01:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
wood to that wood call we we T we you
 
01:01:45.990 --> 01:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
know we tend to comp compartmentalize
 
01:01:49.510 --> 01:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
things today as they affect us
 
01:01:53.390 --> 01:01:53.400 align:start position:0%
directly and and that that's just not
 
01:01:55.549 --> 01:01:55.559 align:start position:0%
the way that's not the way that not the
 
01:01:58.549 --> 01:01:58.559 align:start position:0%
way to do it as it relates to a to to a
 
01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
call yeah thanks and also of course the
 
01:02:03.510 --> 01:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
activity is worthwhile I guess even in
 
01:02:05.069 --> 01:02:05.079 align:start position:0%
and of itself even if you don't make it
 
01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
to the pros like I actually got a nice
 
01:02:09.309 --> 01:02:09.319 align:start position:0%
postcard encouraging me to renew my
 
01:02:12.510 --> 01:02:12.520 align:start position:0%
season ticket subscription from a Casey
 
01:02:14.269 --> 01:02:14.279 align:start position:0%
DeAndre who was an outstanding college
 
01:02:15.589 --> 01:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
player and actually guess was signed to
 
01:02:17.390 --> 01:02:17.400 align:start position:0%
a pro contract but didn't make the cut
 
01:02:19.789 --> 01:02:19.799 align:start position:0%
but he still you know he still moved on
 
01:02:21.430 --> 01:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
to a good career as a coach after
 
01:02:23.309 --> 01:02:23.319 align:start position:0%
playing so like there's more to it than
 
01:02:25.630 --> 01:02:25.640 align:start position:0%
just Mak a college scholarship or
 
01:02:27.549 --> 01:02:27.559 align:start position:0%
playing the pros too of course yeah well
 
01:02:29.349 --> 01:02:29.359 align:start position:0%
we're we're happy when the athletes
 
01:02:31.870 --> 01:02:31.880 align:start position:0%
could move all to a better station in
 
01:02:34.230 --> 01:02:34.240 align:start position:0%
life and become good citizens that's
 
01:02:35.910 --> 01:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
kind what it's all about yes
 
01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:37.670 align:start position:0%
kind what it's all about yes
representative

01:02:37.670 --> 01:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:02:40.549 --> 01:02:40.559 align:start position:0%
Tri representative Horan brought up a a
 
01:02:44.150 --> 01:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
excellent point uh I've I have
 
01:02:45.870 --> 01:02:45.880 align:start position:0%
grandchildren if you can believe that
 
01:02:49.309 --> 01:02:49.319 align:start position:0%
and uh they're Sports people and uh i'
 
01:02:52.190 --> 01:02:52.200 align:start position:0%
go in the Su of their games and uh the
 
01:02:54.510 --> 01:02:54.520 align:start position:0%
uh it's interesting the
 
01:02:58.870 --> 01:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh they relaxation of the
 
01:03:02.750 --> 01:03:02.760 align:start position:0%
uh rules in some of the games you know I
 
01:03:05.069 --> 01:03:05.079 align:start position:0%
think that's probably you know something
 
01:03:07.829 --> 01:03:07.839 align:start position:0%
that uh I know I've gone like this to
 
01:03:12.630 --> 01:03:12.640 align:start position:0%
the uh officials and uh I'm sure that's
 
01:03:15.549 --> 01:03:15.559 align:start position:0%
probably offensive in some manner would
 
01:03:17.910 --> 01:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
would this bill apply to
 
01:03:20.510 --> 01:03:20.520 align:start position:0%
that well that's that thank you for the
 
01:03:23.829 --> 01:03:23.839 align:start position:0%
C that's pretty far-reaching
 
01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
but it it it applies as to uh the event
 
01:03:31.190 --> 01:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
the official the person who's who's
 
01:03:34.430 --> 01:03:34.440 align:start position:0%
officiating it and and talks about the
 
01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:37.240 align:start position:0%
rules who enforces the rules irees
 
01:03:40.269 --> 01:03:40.279 align:start position:0%
referees timers scorers regardless of
 
01:03:42.390 --> 01:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
whether the person's paid or doesn't get
 
01:03:45.349 --> 01:03:45.359 align:start position:0%
but so it's it's it's helpful in that
 
01:03:47.670 --> 01:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
respect we're trying to cover as many
 
01:03:51.990 --> 01:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
bases as we can to handle a situation
 
01:03:53.670 --> 01:03:53.680 align:start position:0%
that has become
 
01:03:57.390 --> 01:03:57.400 align:start position:0%
pervasive and uh try to put the capital
 
01:03:59.990 --> 01:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
and uh and do something uh and do
 
01:04:01.069 --> 01:04:01.079 align:start position:0%
something about
 
01:04:05.390 --> 01:04:05.400 align:start position:0%
it this is a this is one this is one
 
01:04:08.910 --> 01:04:08.920 align:start position:0%
step and we're trying to do the best we
 
01:04:11.349 --> 01:04:11.359 align:start position:0%
can with this one
 
01:04:13.950 --> 01:04:13.960 align:start position:0%
step Mr chair yes representative D
 
01:04:16.069 --> 01:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
Lorenzo thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:04:18.109 --> 01:04:18.119 align:start position:0%
for taking my question Senator do you
 
01:04:19.789 --> 01:04:19.799 align:start position:0%
think that some of the music that's
 
01:04:21.630 --> 01:04:21.640 align:start position:0%
played during some of these events is
 
01:04:23.829 --> 01:04:23.839 align:start position:0%
pumping people
 
01:04:27.150 --> 01:04:27.160 align:start position:0%
up that's that's a good question
 
01:04:30.309 --> 01:04:30.319 align:start position:0%
sure that's what it's I mean the fans
 
01:04:33.789 --> 01:04:33.799 align:start position:0%
yes get a hype site sure it and in some
 
01:04:36.630 --> 01:04:36.640 align:start position:0%
ways you know that's that's a good thing
 
01:04:39.069 --> 01:04:39.079 align:start position:0%
if it just promotes cheering and
 
01:04:41.910 --> 01:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
supporting the team you know that that's
 
01:04:43.950 --> 01:04:43.960 align:start position:0%
all part of that's all part of the game
 
01:04:45.230 --> 01:04:45.240 align:start position:0%
really it's an
 
01:04:49.710 --> 01:04:49.720 align:start position:0%
event and as a friend of mine said uh
 
01:04:52.109 --> 01:04:52.119 align:start position:0%
these are social events and we've we've
 
01:04:53.870 --> 01:04:53.880 align:start position:0%
what we've done is we've taken the event
 
01:04:56.990 --> 01:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
and we've we've given it an expans of
 
01:04:59.430 --> 01:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
quality uh where it where it used to be
 
01:05:03.430 --> 01:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
a game now now it's
 
01:05:06.349 --> 01:05:06.359 align:start position:0%
uh it's a little bit more than that
 
01:05:10.069 --> 01:05:10.079 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
01:05:13.950 --> 01:05:13.960 align:start position:0%
Smith Senator before I'm called out of
 
01:05:15.470 --> 01:05:15.480 align:start position:0%
order for this
 
01:05:19.430 --> 01:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
question um I would ask you do you think
 
01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:24.640 align:start position:0%
this complete lack of respect for
 
01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:26.950 align:start position:0%
this complete lack of respect for
institutions

01:05:26.950 --> 01:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
institutions
 
01:05:30.829 --> 01:05:30.839 align:start position:0%
could be best addressed if respect for
 
01:05:35.510 --> 01:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:39.309 --> 01:05:39.319 align:start position:0%
top yeah it's a great question of course
 
01:05:41.069 --> 01:05:41.079 align:start position:0%
me look at
 
01:05:44.470 --> 01:05:44.480 align:start position:0%
uh the great the great reference is
 
01:05:46.829 --> 01:05:46.839 align:start position:0%
listen everything everything starts at
 
01:05:48.710 --> 01:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
the top it flows
 
01:05:52.549 --> 01:05:52.559 align:start position:0%
down and when it when that happens in in
 
01:05:54.750 --> 01:05:54.760 align:start position:0%
a positive manner you you get you get a
 
01:05:56.510 --> 01:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
good result
 
01:05:58.430 --> 01:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:00.630 align:start position:0%
but uh
sure

01:06:00.630 --> 01:06:00.640 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:06:03.950 --> 01:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
uh and uh it's kind of the way it should
 
01:06:07.190 --> 01:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
be so I Senator one of the things I
 
01:06:09.589 --> 01:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
particularly like about this bill is I
 
01:06:13.750 --> 01:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
think I think it you you
 
01:06:17.670 --> 01:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
wisely did not you made the penalties
 
01:06:20.029 --> 01:06:20.039 align:start position:0%
for the for the offenses the same as the
 
01:06:22.630 --> 01:06:22.640 align:start position:0%
penalties for whatever the underlying
 
01:06:23.990 --> 01:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
crime and I thought that was good and
 
01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
but I particularly like
 
01:06:28.950 --> 01:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
this the Roman numeral 3 which which
 
01:06:31.910 --> 01:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
allows the court to
 
01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
impose uh uh exclusion from uh
 
01:06:40.510 --> 01:06:40.520 align:start position:0%
attending uh sports events I mean I
 
01:06:43.230 --> 01:06:43.240 align:start position:0%
think that's you know that may be that
 
01:06:45.710 --> 01:06:45.720 align:start position:0%
may be the thing that is the most
 
01:06:47.950 --> 01:06:47.960 align:start position:0%
telling penalty and I think I think it's
 
01:06:49.789 --> 01:06:49.799 align:start position:0%
a very you know an excellent an
 
01:06:52.870 --> 01:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
excellent idea uh we thank you thank you
 
01:06:54.990 --> 01:06:55.000 align:start position:0%
we we'll we'll thank the drafters for
 
01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.870 align:start position:0%
we we'll we'll thank the drafters for
that

01:06:57.870 --> 01:06:57.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:01.029 --> 01:07:01.039 align:start position:0%
uh sure and I think that's a that's a
 
01:07:02.950 --> 01:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
big that's a very important part of the
 
01:07:06.630 --> 01:07:06.640 align:start position:0%
deal uh excluding those people right for
 
01:07:09.990 --> 01:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
sure right other questions for s yes
 
01:07:11.510 --> 01:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
representative Kenny I thank you Mr
 
01:07:12.510 --> 01:07:12.520 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
01:07:14.069 --> 01:07:14.079 align:start position:0%
question um so I just have a question
 
01:07:16.349 --> 01:07:16.359 align:start position:0%
since we've heard about uh possible
 
01:07:18.309 --> 01:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
amendments and other issues that could
 
01:07:20.510 --> 01:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
be tackled you know involving players
 
01:07:22.829 --> 01:07:22.839 align:start position:0%
and fans and whatnot is it would it be
 
01:07:25.069 --> 01:07:25.079 align:start position:0%
your preference or do you suggest that
 
01:07:27.190 --> 01:07:27.200 align:start position:0%
we tack this one issue in this piece of
 
01:07:29.230 --> 01:07:29.240 align:start position:0%
legislation and those are ideas for the
 
01:07:31.470 --> 01:07:31.480 align:start position:0%
future or would you like to see this
 
01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
amended to tackle those other issues
 
01:07:35.630 --> 01:07:35.640 align:start position:0%
thank you well thank you thank you for
 
01:07:38.430 --> 01:07:38.440 align:start position:0%
the comments I I think um what I want to
 
01:07:41.230 --> 01:07:41.240 align:start position:0%
see is is the legislation passed uh so
 
01:07:43.309 --> 01:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
that we get something uh something in
 
01:07:46.990 --> 01:07:47.000 align:start position:0%
place uh I I think it's really your
 
01:07:50.349 --> 01:07:50.359 align:start position:0%
decision as to whether you exp the scope
 
01:07:52.150 --> 01:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
of of of the legislation or not that's
 
01:07:54.150 --> 01:07:54.160 align:start position:0%
why we have these hearings and and
 
01:07:56.309 --> 01:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
indeed um
 
01:07:57.750 --> 01:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
that's that's the will of that's the
 
01:07:58.990 --> 01:07:59.000 align:start position:0%
will of the
 
01:08:01.510 --> 01:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
committee I I think a person comes here
 
01:08:04.269 --> 01:08:04.279 align:start position:0%
and presents their views on a piece of
 
01:08:06.789 --> 01:08:06.799 align:start position:0%
legislation based on what they have
 
01:08:10.309 --> 01:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
brought forth in the document that I
 
01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
brought I have brought forth represents
 
01:08:16.590 --> 01:08:16.600 align:start position:0%
what what I perceive and the and the
 
01:08:19.550 --> 01:08:19.560 align:start position:0%
drafters of this perceive as the
 
01:08:21.189 --> 01:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
addressing the question that that I
 
01:08:22.789 --> 01:08:22.799 align:start position:0%
brought forth when I asked them to draft
 
01:08:26.110 --> 01:08:26.120 align:start position:0%
this legislation but but listen there's
 
01:08:28.309 --> 01:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
no pride of authorship in this world
 
01:08:33.070 --> 01:08:33.080 align:start position:0%
anymore you know everything is uh uh I
 
01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:34.470 align:start position:0%
anymore you know everything is uh uh I
think

01:08:34.470 --> 01:08:34.480 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:08:37.870 --> 01:08:37.880 align:start position:0%
everything everything is always subject
 
01:08:41.950 --> 01:08:41.960 align:start position:0%

01:10:52.709 --> 01:10:52.719 align:start position:0%

01:11:03.350 --> 01:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
Behavior at the game was fine after the
 
01:11:05.510 --> 01:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
game we might have you know repaired to
 
01:11:07.790 --> 01:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
a uh
 
01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:15.189 --> 01:11:15.199 align:start position:0%
establishment right right uh so I want
 
01:11:16.870 --> 01:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
to thank Senator delis Sandro who worked
 
01:11:18.790 --> 01:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
with us on on the legislation and for
 
01:11:23.070 --> 01:11:23.080 align:start position:0%
your uh your comments uh uh Mr chair I
 
01:11:25.350 --> 01:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
also spoke with that reporter from ESPN
 
01:11:27.510 --> 01:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
yesterday and there are 22 other states
 
01:11:29.709 --> 01:11:29.719 align:start position:0%
that have legislation addressing
 
01:11:32.550 --> 01:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
protection of of uh Sports officials
 
01:11:35.030 --> 01:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
this legislative session 13 other states
 
01:11:37.629 --> 01:11:37.639 align:start position:0%
are looking at legislation of different
 
01:11:40.830 --> 01:11:40.840 align:start position:0%
types and her question was why now and
 
01:11:42.550 --> 01:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
uh I think it's it's a bill it's time
 
01:11:44.270 --> 01:11:44.280 align:start position:0%
has come it's an issue that has been
 
01:11:47.070 --> 01:11:47.080 align:start position:0%
long festering in our Sports culture
 
01:11:50.030 --> 01:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
kill the UMP you know uh coming out
 
01:11:53.189 --> 01:11:53.199 align:start position:0%
bumping the chest kicking dirt uh on the
 
01:11:55.189 --> 01:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
Umpire as you said there's just a
 
01:11:57.270 --> 01:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
General loss of Civility as I'm sure
 
01:11:59.189 --> 01:11:59.199 align:start position:0%
you've seen in your own emails sent to
 
01:12:01.950 --> 01:12:01.960 align:start position:0%
you and uh but more I think it's it's
 
01:12:04.310 --> 01:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
coming to aead because now people have
 
01:12:06.390 --> 01:12:06.400 align:start position:0%
uh cameras with them and we've seen
 
01:12:08.030 --> 01:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
plenty of online videos that have
 
01:12:11.990 --> 01:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
shocked us um with uh officials getting
 
01:12:15.229 --> 01:12:15.239 align:start position:0%
punched getting you know knocked down uh
 
01:12:17.110 --> 01:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
followed to their car and
 
01:12:19.950 --> 01:12:19.960 align:start position:0%
harassed and uh you know this the stats
 
01:12:22.070 --> 01:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
are here in New Hampshire that
 
01:12:24.870 --> 01:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
11% of sports officials report having
 
01:12:27.550 --> 01:12:27.560 align:start position:0%
been assaulted uh during a game or after
 
01:12:29.709 --> 01:12:29.719 align:start position:0%
a game and that 40% have been made to
 
01:12:33.390 --> 01:12:33.400 align:start position:0%
feel unsafe and I think it's that people
 
01:12:37.830 --> 01:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
behave on a field or in an auditorium or
 
01:12:39.750 --> 01:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
uh the grid iron or in the stands in a
 
01:12:42.790 --> 01:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
way they never would at work or in a
 
01:12:44.910 --> 01:12:44.920 align:start position:0%
restaurant and say things to people they
 
01:12:46.669 --> 01:12:46.679 align:start position:0%
would never say to a waiter or a
 
01:12:49.229 --> 01:12:49.239 align:start position:0%
coworker or a person on the street
 
01:12:50.629 --> 01:12:50.639 align:start position:0%
because they feel like it's part of the
 
01:12:53.110 --> 01:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
game and that for some reason within the
 
01:12:56.030 --> 01:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
confines of the ball field or the
 
01:12:58.229 --> 01:12:58.239 align:start position:0%
gymnasium the rules that sort of guide
 
01:13:01.310 --> 01:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
us decorum and of criminality somehow
 
01:13:04.110 --> 01:13:04.120 align:start position:0%
don't apply and uh that's caused a
 
01:13:06.470 --> 01:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
shortage of officials uh doing these
 
01:13:09.350 --> 01:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
games across all sports at at the Senate
 
01:13:11.189 --> 01:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
hearing we had representatives from
 
01:13:14.870 --> 01:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
football basketball volleyball lacrosse
 
01:13:17.550 --> 01:13:17.560 align:start position:0%
the soccer um and they have all said
 
01:13:19.550 --> 01:13:19.560 align:start position:0%
that this has become a problem not just
 
01:13:22.110 --> 01:13:22.120 align:start position:0%
the high school level but all levels
 
01:13:24.709 --> 01:13:24.719 align:start position:0%
that the the officials are leaving in
 
01:13:27.030 --> 01:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
drobes primarily a lot of them are aging
 
01:13:28.870 --> 01:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
out and we're not getting young ones
 
01:13:32.310 --> 01:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
coming in but primarily for harassment
 
01:13:35.030 --> 01:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
and other this kind of this kind of
 
01:13:37.669 --> 01:13:37.679 align:start position:0%
issue um I'd say just based on sort of
 
01:13:39.270 --> 01:13:39.280 align:start position:0%
the the initial questions from the
 
01:13:41.070 --> 01:13:41.080 align:start position:0%
committee I don't think this bill is as
 
01:13:44.470 --> 01:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
far-reaching as maybe the questions seem
 
01:13:46.709 --> 01:13:46.719 align:start position:0%
to apply I think this bill is very
 
01:13:49.390 --> 01:13:49.400 align:start position:0%
modest and elegant certainly compared to
 
01:13:50.990 --> 01:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
what other states have other states have
 
01:13:53.149 --> 01:13:53.159 align:start position:0%
something or they're proposing something
 
01:13:55.750 --> 01:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
to can assault on a police officer
 
01:13:58.430 --> 01:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
being assault on on an official really
 
01:14:01.110 --> 01:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
all this bill does and he pointed out in
 
01:14:05.350 --> 01:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
Roman 3 is that uh all this really it
 
01:14:06.950 --> 01:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
this doesn't change the definition of
 
01:14:09.990 --> 01:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
any assault if you look at at Roman 2
 
01:14:12.830 --> 01:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
basically the offender has to commit the
 
01:14:15.030 --> 01:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
crime it's already on the book first
 
01:14:16.830 --> 01:14:16.840 align:start position:0%
degree assault simple assault criminal
 
01:14:19.430 --> 01:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
threatening there isn't you know we're
 
01:14:21.750 --> 01:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
not criminalizing arguing they're not
 
01:14:24.149 --> 01:14:24.159 align:start position:0%
trying to codify good sportsmanship so
 
01:14:25.830 --> 01:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
something represent like just kind of
 
01:14:27.830 --> 01:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
going like that you know we're not going
 
01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
to say please bring an officer in but I
 
01:14:32.669 --> 01:14:32.679 align:start position:0%
think what this does is that for the
 
01:14:35.350 --> 01:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
person who does commit one of these
 
01:14:37.990 --> 01:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
crimes against an official on the field
 
01:14:40.790 --> 01:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
this adds an additional penalty that
 
01:14:42.870 --> 01:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
what act as a deterrent if you could say
 
01:14:46.229 --> 01:14:46.239 align:start position:0%
that in addition to you know uh being uh
 
01:14:48.390 --> 01:14:48.400 align:start position:0%
charged with a felony or whatever that
 
01:14:50.990 --> 01:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
you can't watch your kid for a year or
 
01:14:52.709 --> 01:14:52.719 align:start position:0%
that you can never come back because
 
01:14:54.189 --> 01:14:54.199 align:start position:0%
you've done this the second time that's
 
01:14:55.669 --> 01:14:55.679 align:start position:0%
very powerful
 
01:14:59.149 --> 01:14:59.159 align:start position:0%
I think and it it sends a message and
 
01:15:01.750 --> 01:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
you know why would not this bill uh
 
01:15:04.350 --> 01:15:04.360 align:start position:0%
address these kinds of behaviors uh
 
01:15:07.270 --> 01:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
directed towards fans or players I I
 
01:15:10.310 --> 01:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
would just say that house is not on fire
 
01:15:13.870 --> 01:15:13.880 align:start position:0%
and this house is on fire and you know
 
01:15:16.470 --> 01:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
maybe uh an additional bill down the
 
01:15:18.270 --> 01:15:18.280 align:start position:0%
road could address that it's the
 
01:15:19.870 --> 01:15:19.880 align:start position:0%
prerogative of the of the committee
 
01:15:21.470 --> 01:15:21.480 align:start position:0%
obviously to amend it and make it
 
01:15:24.149 --> 01:15:24.159 align:start position:0%
stronger right now we think this is you
 
01:15:26.070 --> 01:15:26.080 align:start position:0%
know again this is very elegant bill
 
01:15:28.189 --> 01:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
that addresses hopefully addresses the
 
01:15:32.830 --> 01:15:32.840 align:start position:0%
problem um so I think lastly it it
 
01:15:34.390 --> 01:15:34.400 align:start position:0%
hopefully accomplishes two things one it
 
01:15:37.470 --> 01:15:37.480 align:start position:0%
sends a message to all coaches players
 
01:15:39.950 --> 01:15:39.960 align:start position:0%
parents and quite frankly to police and
 
01:15:41.750 --> 01:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
prosecutors and judges who might be
 
01:15:44.229 --> 01:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
dealing uh with a case like this that
 
01:15:46.510 --> 01:15:46.520 align:start position:0%
this is not part of the game that
 
01:15:48.709 --> 01:15:48.719 align:start position:0%
assault is assault and criminal
 
01:15:49.990 --> 01:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
threatening is threatening and
 
01:15:51.629 --> 01:15:51.639 align:start position:0%
harassment is harassment and these are
 
01:15:53.790 --> 01:15:53.800 align:start position:0%
laws that we already have but for some
 
01:15:55.870 --> 01:15:55.880 align:start position:0%
reason in this context people don't seem
 
01:15:58.430 --> 01:15:58.440 align:start position:0%
to understand it's not part of the game
 
01:16:00.830 --> 01:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
and it will keep us safe and if the game
 
01:16:03.629 --> 01:16:03.639 align:start position:0%
is not safe for officials it's not safe
 
01:16:06.110 --> 01:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
for the children who play it so uh and
 
01:16:08.470 --> 01:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
I've submitted written testimony and so
 
01:16:10.270 --> 01:16:10.280 align:start position:0%
to not belabor it I'm happy to answer
 
01:16:12.350 --> 01:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
any questions see about the legislation
 
01:16:14.510 --> 01:16:14.520 align:start position:0%
or about what is happening out there
 
01:16:17.070 --> 01:16:17.080 align:start position:0%
that I I could answer for you questions
 
01:16:18.550 --> 01:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
for this
 
01:16:20.830 --> 01:16:20.840 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
01:16:23.910 --> 01:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
sir thank you Mr
 
01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:26.890 align:start position:0%
dlos it was the only game we won that
 
01:16:26.890 --> 01:16:36.149 align:start position:0%
dlos it was the only game we won that
[Laughter]

01:16:36.149 --> 01:16:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:38.629 --> 01:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
year that's G to be a tough act to
 
01:16:42.350 --> 01:16:42.360 align:start position:0%
follow oh I'm sorry my name is for the
 
01:16:44.270 --> 01:16:44.280 align:start position:0%
record Stuart dlas I'm an attorney I
 
01:16:45.870 --> 01:16:45.880 align:start position:0%
practice in Durham New Hampshire I'm now
 
01:16:47.669 --> 01:16:47.679 align:start position:0%
affiliated with the coolage law firm
 
01:16:49.550 --> 01:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
which is located in summersworth my
 
01:16:52.350 --> 01:16:52.360 align:start position:0%
partner and I merged with him on August
 
01:16:56.390 --> 01:16:56.400 align:start position:0%
1st of last year on November 30 1981
 
01:16:58.709 --> 01:16:58.719 align:start position:0%
when I was a sophomore at the University
 
01:17:00.470 --> 01:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
of Vermont I completed the Apprentice
 
01:17:02.350 --> 01:17:02.360 align:start position:0%
program took the written test and passed
 
01:17:04.229 --> 01:17:04.239 align:start position:0%
it and became a certified basketball
 
01:17:07.950 --> 01:17:07.960 align:start position:0%
official the following March of
 
01:17:10.629 --> 01:17:10.639 align:start position:0%
1981 when I passed the so-called floor
 
01:17:12.270 --> 01:17:12.280 align:start position:0%
test that's when someone observes you to
 
01:17:13.550 --> 01:17:13.560 align:start position:0%
make sure you know where to stand and
 
01:17:15.149 --> 01:17:15.159 align:start position:0%
how to raise your hand and do stuff like
 
01:17:18.350 --> 01:17:18.360 align:start position:0%
that it wasn't until six years later on
 
01:17:19.910 --> 01:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
February 1
 
01:17:22.350 --> 01:17:22.360 align:start position:0%
1977 that I was sworn into practice
 
01:17:24.110 --> 01:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
before the New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
01:17:26.990 --> 01:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
when George Papa gianis the clerk
 
01:17:29.510 --> 01:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
introduced James yakovac who was there
 
01:17:31.870 --> 01:17:31.880 align:start position:0%
for an oral argument who introduced
 
01:17:34.110 --> 01:17:34.120 align:start position:0%
Stuart doop so I like to say it was Papa
 
01:17:36.709 --> 01:17:36.719 align:start position:0%
gianis to Yakov vakas to toas sort of
 
01:17:39.870 --> 01:17:39.880 align:start position:0%
like Tinker St to chance if you follow
 
01:17:42.629 --> 01:17:42.639 align:start position:0%
baseball but not quite as famous so I've
 
01:17:44.390 --> 01:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
been a basketball referee longer than
 
01:17:46.590 --> 01:17:46.600 align:start position:0%
I've been a lawyer I just completed my
 
01:17:49.950 --> 01:17:49.960 align:start position:0%
53rd year uh there are very few of us
 
01:17:52.990 --> 01:17:53.000 align:start position:0%
who do 50 years as an official uh I'm
 
01:17:54.430 --> 01:17:54.440 align:start position:0%
proud of the fact that I've actually
 
01:17:56.790 --> 01:17:56.800 align:start position:0%
officiated at the varsity I contined to
 
01:17:58.590 --> 01:17:58.600 align:start position:0%
officiate at the varsity level in my
 
01:18:02.270 --> 01:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
53rd year a lot of people just um go
 
01:18:03.910 --> 01:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
down to the middle school games I do
 
01:18:05.950 --> 01:18:05.960 align:start position:0%
some of those as well and I took up
 
01:18:07.990 --> 01:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
soccer officiating in
 
01:18:10.189 --> 01:18:10.199 align:start position:0%
1997 when my daughter was young and I
 
01:18:11.350 --> 01:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
thought it would be nice to get out in
 
01:18:13.189 --> 01:18:13.199 align:start position:0%
the afternoons and enjoy some of the
 
01:18:14.310 --> 01:18:14.320 align:start position:0%
weather in New
 
01:18:16.950 --> 01:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I also have a background I
 
01:18:18.790 --> 01:18:18.800 align:start position:0%
have a little packet that I'd like to
 
01:18:20.950 --> 01:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
submit later on that has just some
 
01:18:22.629 --> 01:18:22.639 align:start position:0%
biographical information I've had an
 
01:18:25.149 --> 01:18:25.159 align:start position:0%
interest in sports law since I was in
 
01:18:26.910 --> 01:18:26.920 align:start position:0%
law school after I got out of law school
 
01:18:30.030 --> 01:18:30.040 align:start position:0%
starting in 1978 I began to co-author
 
01:18:32.189 --> 01:18:32.199 align:start position:0%
articles for referee magazine which was
 
01:18:35.189 --> 01:18:35.199 align:start position:0%
a nationwide publication for sports
 
01:18:38.910 --> 01:18:38.920 align:start position:0%
officials uh it's the magazine now and I
 
01:18:40.310 --> 01:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
also participated in a couple of
 
01:18:41.950 --> 01:18:41.960 align:start position:0%
conferences put on by the National
 
01:18:43.790 --> 01:18:43.800 align:start position:0%
Association of sports officials
 
01:18:46.030 --> 01:18:46.040 align:start position:0%
primarily because my law school friend
 
01:18:48.910 --> 01:18:48.920 align:start position:0%
was a driving force uh behind that and I
 
01:18:51.189 --> 01:18:51.199 align:start position:0%
also have a little blur out of a case
 
01:18:52.990 --> 01:18:53.000 align:start position:0%
from North Carolina where the judges
 
01:18:55.510 --> 01:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
talk about uh why people go to sporting
 
01:18:57.590 --> 01:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
events I'll let you read that yourself
 
01:18:59.390 --> 01:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
and as Kevin mentioned the National
 
01:19:01.350 --> 01:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
Association National Association of
 
01:19:03.709 --> 01:19:03.719 align:start position:0%
sports officials publishes uh
 
01:19:06.030 --> 01:19:06.040 align:start position:0%
information through referee magazine
 
01:19:08.110 --> 01:19:08.120 align:start position:0%
primarily and I have a packet that I
 
01:19:10.070 --> 01:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
printed out for you which shows the
 
01:19:13.189 --> 01:19:13.199 align:start position:0%
different states that have legislation
 
01:19:14.229 --> 01:19:14.239 align:start position:0%
the different states that are
 
01:19:18.110 --> 01:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
considering it a list of the type of uh
 
01:19:21.030 --> 01:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
legislation that's been passed and print
 
01:19:25.910 --> 01:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
out of the laws if you're interested uh
 
01:19:29.390 --> 01:19:29.400 align:start position:0%
I think uh Kevin made the most important
 
01:19:33.070 --> 01:19:33.080 align:start position:0%
point about what's going on here uh with
 
01:19:35.390 --> 01:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
this legislation this legislation is
 
01:19:37.270 --> 01:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
targeted to a
 
01:19:41.149 --> 01:19:41.159 align:start position:0%
specific issue and that issue is if a
 
01:19:42.910 --> 01:19:42.920 align:start position:0%
person commits a crime we're not talking
 
01:19:44.390 --> 01:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
about bad behavior we're talking about a
 
01:19:46.470 --> 01:19:46.480 align:start position:0%
crime and that victim is a sports
 
01:19:48.510 --> 01:19:48.520 align:start position:0%
official is there anything on the books
 
01:19:51.030 --> 01:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
now that would enable a judge to Clearly
 
01:19:53.189 --> 01:19:53.199 align:start position:0%
say to that person in addition to the
 
01:19:55.430 --> 01:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
sentence I'm going to impose
 
01:19:57.550 --> 01:19:57.560 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ban you from going to a
 
01:19:57.560 --> 01:19:58.669 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ban you from going to a
sporting

01:19:58.669 --> 01:19:58.679 align:start position:0%
sporting
 
01:20:01.270 --> 01:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
event there isn't anything like that in
 
01:20:03.950 --> 01:20:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:06.709 --> 01:20:06.719 align:start position:0%
code I think a judge probably could do
 
01:20:08.310 --> 01:20:08.320 align:start position:0%
that but I think it's unclear but this
 
01:20:09.990 --> 01:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
bill would make it clear that the court
 
01:20:11.790 --> 01:20:11.800 align:start position:0%
has that Authority it's just another
 
01:20:14.310 --> 01:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
tool in the sentencing toolbox that a
 
01:20:16.750 --> 01:20:16.760 align:start position:0%
judge can use but I just wanted to
 
01:20:18.189 --> 01:20:18.199 align:start position:0%
Circle back for those of you who have
 
01:20:20.709 --> 01:20:20.719 align:start position:0%
never officiated you really need to
 
01:20:22.709 --> 01:20:22.719 align:start position:0%
understand that the reason that these
 
01:20:25.070 --> 01:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
arguments are so vicious at these
 
01:20:26.990 --> 01:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
sporting events is because they're so
 
01:20:28.110 --> 01:20:28.120 align:start position:0%
little at
 
01:20:31.990 --> 01:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
stake the adults for some reason are
 
01:20:35.470 --> 01:20:35.480 align:start position:0%
trying to relive their youth or they're
 
01:20:37.390 --> 01:20:37.400 align:start position:0%
enamored with a prospect that their kid
 
01:20:39.350 --> 01:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
who's the 12th person sitting on the
 
01:20:40.790 --> 01:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
bench is going to be a division one
 
01:20:42.590 --> 01:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
athlete and they won't have to pay
 
01:20:44.870 --> 01:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
tuition uh or something else is going on
 
01:20:48.750 --> 01:20:48.760 align:start position:0%
in their life but it's become
 
01:20:52.669 --> 01:20:52.679 align:start position:0%
increasingly distressing to see what
 
01:20:54.870 --> 01:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
people are doing in the arenas what
 
01:20:56.550 --> 01:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
people are saying in the Arenas and
 
01:20:57.790 --> 01:20:57.800 align:start position:0%
sometimes and this happened to me at the
 
01:21:02.270 --> 01:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
end of a soccer game I did U more much
 
01:21:03.669 --> 01:21:03.679 align:start position:0%
in the school because the school was
 
01:21:05.550 --> 01:21:05.560 align:start position:0%
very supportive but I was walking across
 
01:21:07.390 --> 01:21:07.400 align:start position:0%
the field with my partner who was a
 
01:21:10.270 --> 01:21:10.280 align:start position:0%
championship level official so we we
 
01:21:11.950 --> 01:21:11.960 align:start position:0%
were doing a decent job and he was doing
 
01:21:14.229 --> 01:21:14.239 align:start position:0%
a great job and somebody started to
 
01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
approach us probably a parent from one
 
01:21:20.550 --> 01:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
of the uh from the losing team uh
 
01:21:22.629 --> 01:21:22.639 align:start position:0%
berating us for not giving a red card to
 
01:21:25.070 --> 01:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
somebody and the athletic directors just
 
01:21:28.229 --> 01:21:28.239 align:start position:0%
stood and said just go back the trouble
 
01:21:30.149 --> 01:21:30.159 align:start position:0%
with now is in society is you don't know
 
01:21:31.350 --> 01:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
if someone's going to come up and
 
01:21:33.830 --> 01:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
actually hit you or pull a gun or do
 
01:21:36.470 --> 01:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
something like that that I think is what
 
01:21:38.709 --> 01:21:38.719 align:start position:0%
we're facing as officials that's what is
 
01:21:40.189 --> 01:21:40.199 align:start position:0%
discouraging people from becoming
 
01:21:43.310 --> 01:21:43.320 align:start position:0%
involved in this and I know that
 
01:21:46.070 --> 01:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
firsthand because and I know the date
 
01:21:47.430 --> 01:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
because I used to keep a chart when I
 
01:21:49.189 --> 01:21:49.199 align:start position:0%
first started to officiate or where I
 
01:21:52.430 --> 01:21:52.440 align:start position:0%
officiated when I was officiating who I
 
01:21:54.189 --> 01:21:54.199 align:start position:0%
was officiating with and how much I got
 
01:21:55.750 --> 01:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
paid because they needed it for tax
 
01:21:58.870 --> 01:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
purposes on March 2 1981 in DOA New
 
01:22:00.350 --> 01:22:00.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at the old Butterfield gym
 
01:22:02.629 --> 01:22:02.639 align:start position:0%
which is now the Children's Museum when
 
01:22:05.229 --> 01:22:05.239 align:start position:0%
I was doing a playoff game in the men's
 
01:22:08.189 --> 01:22:08.199 align:start position:0%
league I got paid $15 and I did two
 
01:22:10.070 --> 01:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
games and I have a note in the right-and
 
01:22:11.950 --> 01:22:11.960 align:start position:0%
column that's what I usually put down if
 
01:22:14.189 --> 01:22:14.199 align:start position:0%
I called it technical foul or something
 
01:22:16.030 --> 01:22:16.040 align:start position:0%
I was assaulted by a player after the
 
01:22:17.669 --> 01:22:17.679 align:start position:0%
game and as I was telling the senate
 
01:22:19.629 --> 01:22:19.639 align:start position:0%
committee what happened was it I walked
 
01:22:22.229 --> 01:22:22.239 align:start position:0%
out and this fellow who looked like a
 
01:22:24.229 --> 01:22:24.239 align:start position:0%
weightlifter who's really strong well
 
01:22:26.750 --> 01:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
built I'm just the opposite of I what I
 
01:22:28.669 --> 01:22:28.679 align:start position:0%
look like and he must have been
 
01:22:30.270 --> 01:22:30.280 align:start position:0%
irritated I must have called a technical
 
01:22:32.350 --> 01:22:32.360 align:start position:0%
voul probably didn't deserve it in his
 
01:22:34.590 --> 01:22:34.600 align:start position:0%
mind and like I said I mean they
 
01:22:37.110 --> 01:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
probably lost the game so I mean who
 
01:22:39.229 --> 01:22:39.239 align:start position:0%
else do you take your frustration on out
 
01:22:41.870 --> 01:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
on but the officials so he saw me walk
 
01:22:43.990 --> 01:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
out of the gym in the corridor and he
 
01:22:45.470 --> 01:22:45.480 align:start position:0%
grabbed me I think it was with his left
 
01:22:47.629 --> 01:22:47.639 align:start position:0%
hand and he put it under my chin and put
 
01:22:50.189 --> 01:22:50.199 align:start position:0%
me up against the wall in front of his
 
01:22:52.590 --> 01:22:52.600 align:start position:0%
friends I thought he was going to hit me
 
01:22:55.350 --> 01:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
um dropped his let me go down to the
 
01:22:57.950 --> 01:22:57.960 align:start position:0%
floor and then I walked away uh
 
01:22:59.550 --> 01:22:59.560 align:start position:0%
unfortunately for him because I knew the
 
01:23:01.629 --> 01:23:01.639 align:start position:0%
prosecutor and do at the time I dictated
 
01:23:03.070 --> 01:23:03.080 align:start position:0%
about an eight-page statement to the
 
01:23:05.030 --> 01:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
secretary I was working for trino at
 
01:23:06.430 --> 01:23:06.440 align:start position:0%
that time I took it down to the police
 
01:23:08.709 --> 01:23:08.719 align:start position:0%
department and I asked my friend who was
 
01:23:11.030 --> 01:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
Prosecuting to file a criminal charge
 
01:23:13.470 --> 01:23:13.480 align:start position:0%
which they did and about two months
 
01:23:14.950 --> 01:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
later I got a phone call from another
 
01:23:18.990 --> 01:23:19.000 align:start position:0%
friend he said uh I said oh what's going
 
01:23:21.590 --> 01:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
on he said IET this guy who came into my
 
01:23:23.629 --> 01:23:23.639 align:start position:0%
office he was charged with assaulting
 
01:23:25.870 --> 01:23:25.880 align:start position:0%
you got arrested
 
01:23:27.910 --> 01:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
he said you know what do you want to do
 
01:23:29.870 --> 01:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
I said I think the Chief Justice can
 
01:23:32.070 --> 01:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate this I said did you get paid
 
01:23:33.629 --> 01:23:33.639 align:start position:0%
he goes oh yeah I get the money up front
 
01:23:35.990 --> 01:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
I said well I really don't care I really
 
01:23:37.590 --> 01:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
don't care I wanted to teach him a
 
01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
lesson so this stuff happens I don't I
 
01:23:45.430 --> 01:23:45.440 align:start position:0%
don't think there are um that many
 
01:23:48.149 --> 01:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
physical assaults yet I don't think
 
01:23:50.709 --> 01:23:50.719 align:start position:0%
there that many cars that are being
 
01:23:54.270 --> 01:23:54.280 align:start position:0%
keyed or uh windshields broken uh I'm
 
01:23:56.229 --> 01:23:56.239 align:start position:0%
not not sure that uh people are getting
 
01:23:59.149 --> 01:23:59.159 align:start position:0%
phone calls at home uh all of which
 
01:24:01.149 --> 01:24:01.159 align:start position:0%
we're afraid might happen down the road
 
01:24:04.189 --> 01:24:04.199 align:start position:0%
I think I think the problem is that
 
01:24:06.070 --> 01:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
people feel that they can do this and
 
01:24:08.390 --> 01:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
there isn't any
 
01:24:10.990 --> 01:24:11.000 align:start position:0%
ramification this bill is not going to
 
01:24:13.709 --> 01:24:13.719 align:start position:0%
change the way people act inside of a
 
01:24:16.070 --> 01:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
basketball arena or at a soccer field
 
01:24:18.750 --> 01:24:18.760 align:start position:0%
you cannot legislate good behavior you
 
01:24:21.350 --> 01:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
can't make a criticism free zone and
 
01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:22.550 align:start position:0%
can't make a criticism free zone and
sporting

01:24:22.550 --> 01:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
sporting
 
01:24:25.550 --> 01:24:25.560 align:start position:0%
event what we want as officials I think
 
01:24:27.790 --> 01:24:27.800 align:start position:0%
is that when people cross the line
 
01:24:30.390 --> 01:24:30.400 align:start position:0%
because I have tools as an official if
 
01:24:32.030 --> 01:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
someone has giv me a hard time and I
 
01:24:33.229 --> 01:24:33.239 align:start position:0%
think they're being
 
01:24:36.310 --> 01:24:36.320 align:start position:0%
disruptive I can say something nicely to
 
01:24:38.709 --> 01:24:38.719 align:start position:0%
them I can ask the athletic director to
 
01:24:40.390 --> 01:24:40.400 align:start position:0%
go over and just say can you tell that
 
01:24:43.310 --> 01:24:43.320 align:start position:0%
guy to shut up or if it's really bad I
 
01:24:46.229 --> 01:24:46.239 align:start position:0%
can just ask the athletic director stop
 
01:24:48.430 --> 01:24:48.440 align:start position:0%
the game and that guy's got to leave we
 
01:24:49.669 --> 01:24:49.679 align:start position:0%
can do all of those things so we can
 
01:24:51.910 --> 01:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
deal with it it creates a problem
 
01:24:52.990 --> 01:24:53.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes because if you have somebody
 
01:24:55.189 --> 01:24:55.199 align:start position:0%
out of control when you escalated it by
 
01:24:56.390 --> 01:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
removing them you don't know what's
 
01:24:57.870 --> 01:24:57.880 align:start position:0%
going to happen but we have tools that
 
01:25:00.229 --> 01:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
can do that and we're not asking anybody
 
01:25:03.149 --> 01:25:03.159 align:start position:0%
to worry about how we do that because
 
01:25:06.229 --> 01:25:06.239 align:start position:0%
people have a right to go to an event
 
01:25:08.189 --> 01:25:08.199 align:start position:0%
and be a jerk if they want to they can
 
01:25:10.070 --> 01:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
be a jerk to the officials we see them
 
01:25:12.830 --> 01:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
talking in a derogatory fashion to other
 
01:25:16.109 --> 01:25:16.119 align:start position:0%
12-year-old kids we see them arguing
 
01:25:17.870 --> 01:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
amongst each other in the
 
01:25:20.270 --> 01:25:20.280 align:start position:0%
stands it's unbelievable I there was a
 
01:25:22.189 --> 01:25:22.199 align:start position:0%
summer league game when I heard one
 
01:25:25.229 --> 01:25:25.239 align:start position:0%
parent say well if he does do that hit
 
01:25:27.870 --> 01:25:27.880 align:start position:0%
him back with the elbow that's a great
 
01:25:31.390 --> 01:25:31.400 align:start position:0%
message for a kid in junior high school
 
01:25:34.669 --> 01:25:34.679 align:start position:0%
or playing on the junor varsity so we're
 
01:25:37.629 --> 01:25:37.639 align:start position:0%
worried about the criminal offenses and
 
01:25:41.149 --> 01:25:41.159 align:start position:0%
when the matter was before the uh Senate
 
01:25:42.830 --> 01:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
there was a suggestion which I think is
 
01:25:45.910 --> 01:25:45.920 align:start position:0%
good there was a suggestion to add to
 
01:25:48.470 --> 01:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
paragraph two which includes simple
 
01:25:50.229 --> 01:25:50.239 align:start position:0%
assault Reckless conduct criminal
 
01:25:50.239 --> 01:25:51.990 align:start position:0%
assault Reckless conduct criminal
threatening

01:25:51.990 --> 01:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
threatening
 
01:25:55.950 --> 01:25:55.960 align:start position:0%
harassment to add stalking and criminal
 
01:25:58.229 --> 01:25:58.239 align:start position:0%
mischief uh to the bill which I think
 
01:25:59.629 --> 01:25:59.639 align:start position:0%
would be a good
 
01:26:02.629 --> 01:26:02.639 align:start position:0%
idea and what what we'd like to see as
 
01:26:04.830 --> 01:26:04.840 align:start position:0%
Sports officials is if someone does
 
01:26:07.590 --> 01:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
something to us and it has to be a
 
01:26:11.350 --> 01:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
crime and we have to be the named victim
 
01:26:14.709 --> 01:26:14.719 align:start position:0%
we like this additional penalty that the
 
01:26:16.870 --> 01:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
Chief Justice had mentioned and that
 
01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
Kevin had mentioned that additional
 
01:26:20.950 --> 01:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
penalty that the judge can say and by
 
01:26:24.590 --> 01:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
the way you can't go to a game that your
 
01:26:26.310 --> 01:26:26.320 align:start position:0%
kid is playing in for a
 
01:26:29.270 --> 01:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
year now if people don't know about this
 
01:26:31.750 --> 01:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
bill in it passes the problem is how are
 
01:26:34.310 --> 01:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
they going to be dis discouraged from
 
01:26:38.109 --> 01:26:38.119 align:start position:0%
acting uh in a criminal fashion and what
 
01:26:40.390 --> 01:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
I hope is that if the bill passes that
 
01:26:43.070 --> 01:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
the uh officiating organizations and I
 
01:26:44.830 --> 01:26:44.840 align:start position:0%
would delegate this to Kevin because he
 
01:26:47.950 --> 01:26:47.960 align:start position:0%
does a good job at this that the
 
01:26:50.390 --> 01:26:50.400 align:start position:0%
supervisors contact the schools through
 
01:26:52.350 --> 01:26:52.360 align:start position:0%
the athletic directors maybe through the
 
01:26:54.270 --> 01:26:54.280 align:start position:0%
school boards and try to get them on
 
01:26:55.750 --> 01:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
board where they put something up in the
 
01:26:57.990 --> 01:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
school where they talk to the coaches
 
01:26:59.910 --> 01:26:59.920 align:start position:0%
and the players before the season starts
 
01:27:02.310 --> 01:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
they have parent meetings and just tell
 
01:27:03.950 --> 01:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
them this is what's going to happen if
 
01:27:05.310 --> 01:27:05.320 align:start position:0%
we have a problem you're not going to be
 
01:27:07.709 --> 01:27:07.719 align:start position:0%
here watching your kid so you've got to
 
01:27:09.750 --> 01:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
talk to your friends and try to Tamper
 
01:27:11.470 --> 01:27:11.480 align:start position:0%
it down is it going to make a big
 
01:27:13.709 --> 01:27:13.719 align:start position:0%
difference I'm not really sure I hope it
 
01:27:15.870 --> 01:27:15.880 align:start position:0%
does it'll make some difference but
 
01:27:18.990 --> 01:27:19.000 align:start position:0%
it'll give us you know some feeling of
 
01:27:20.790 --> 01:27:20.800 align:start position:0%
satisfaction and maybe that's the wrong
 
01:27:22.350 --> 01:27:22.360 align:start position:0%
word but if something happens that we
 
01:27:24.790 --> 01:27:24.800 align:start position:0%
don't have to go to a game and see that
 
01:27:28.390 --> 01:27:28.400 align:start position:0%
person there
 
01:27:32.390 --> 01:27:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:35.390 --> 01:27:35.400 align:start position:0%
um comment I had about the bill before
 
01:27:38.709 --> 01:27:38.719 align:start position:0%
the Senate which I would make here as
 
01:27:41.390 --> 01:27:41.400 align:start position:0%
well is that excuse
 
01:27:44.350 --> 01:27:44.360 align:start position:0%
me um I think in paragraph
 
01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:46.550 align:start position:0%
me um I think in paragraph
two

01:27:46.550 --> 01:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:27:50.790 --> 01:27:50.800 align:start position:0%
um it seems to suggest that this this is
 
01:27:54.870 --> 01:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
a new statute so this is a new crime
 
01:27:56.790 --> 01:27:56.800 align:start position:0%
and I think it would be better to use
 
01:27:58.990 --> 01:27:59.000 align:start position:0%
the word misdemeanor instead of offense
 
01:28:02.750 --> 01:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
in paragraph two so that it is brought
 
01:28:05.270 --> 01:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
as a criminal offense and I say that
 
01:28:08.430 --> 01:28:08.440 align:start position:0%
because when we talk in paragraph three
 
01:28:12.310 --> 01:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
about a person being fined for contempt
 
01:28:14.189 --> 01:28:14.199 align:start position:0%
of court I think it would be cleaner if
 
01:28:15.870 --> 01:28:15.880 align:start position:0%
a judge could just say to somebody I'm
 
01:28:18.030 --> 01:28:18.040 align:start position:0%
going to give you a suspended jail
 
01:28:21.750 --> 01:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
sentence or a suspended fine and it's on
 
01:28:23.669 --> 01:28:23.679 align:start position:0%
two conditions one is good behavior and
 
01:28:25.189 --> 01:28:25.199 align:start position:0%
the other is is you can't go to the game
 
01:28:27.470 --> 01:28:27.480 align:start position:0%
and then if the person sneaks into the
 
01:28:29.870 --> 01:28:29.880 align:start position:0%
next game they might face the imposition
 
01:28:31.790 --> 01:28:31.800 align:start position:0%
the 30-day sentence or the imposition of
 
01:28:33.830 --> 01:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
the fine I just think that would be
 
01:28:35.350 --> 01:28:35.360 align:start position:0%
cleaner it's not a big deal but it's
 
01:28:37.790 --> 01:28:37.800 align:start position:0%
something I mentioned before the
 
01:28:40.910 --> 01:28:40.920 align:start position:0%
Senate uh so I hope you would seriously
 
01:28:42.830 --> 01:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
consider passing this I think you'd be
 
01:28:44.870 --> 01:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
surprised how many people I've been
 
01:28:46.430 --> 01:28:46.440 align:start position:0%
around a long time so people see me in
 
01:28:48.550 --> 01:28:48.560 align:start position:0%
town and see me at sporting events and
 
01:28:50.070 --> 01:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
I've had people say to me I saw you on
 
01:28:52.070 --> 01:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
television uh talking about that bill
 
01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
that's a great idea
 
01:28:56.669 --> 01:28:56.679 align:start position:0%
so the number you know the percentage of
 
01:28:57.870 --> 01:28:57.880 align:start position:0%
people that we're talking about who
 
01:29:00.470 --> 01:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
caused problems for us is relatively
 
01:29:02.590 --> 01:29:02.600 align:start position:0%
small but it's still significant and
 
01:29:06.390 --> 01:29:06.400 align:start position:0%
like Kevin said um our numbers are down
 
01:29:09.629 --> 01:29:09.639 align:start position:0%
really down in Soco last year there were
 
01:29:11.470 --> 01:29:11.480 align:start position:0%
days when our
 
01:29:14.590 --> 01:29:14.600 align:start position:0%
assigner had junior varsity and freshman
 
01:29:17.030 --> 01:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
games officiated by only one official
 
01:29:19.310 --> 01:29:19.320 align:start position:0%
and on one day he had about 20 games
 
01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:20.229 align:start position:0%
and on one day he had about 20 games
like

01:29:20.229 --> 01:29:20.239 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:29:22.709 --> 01:29:22.719 align:start position:0%
that 20 games with only one official
 
01:29:23.750 --> 01:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
because we don't have enough people and
 
01:29:25.270 --> 01:29:25.280 align:start position:0%
other people were doubling up and in
 
01:29:27.070 --> 01:29:27.080 align:start position:0%
basketball some of my friends do three
 
01:29:29.030 --> 01:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
games they'll go to a a school and do a
 
01:29:30.709 --> 01:29:30.719 align:start position:0%
freshman game a junior varsity and a
 
01:29:32.950 --> 01:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
varsity or they'll go to one school do a
 
01:29:34.790 --> 01:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
freshman game and then go to another
 
01:29:37.629 --> 01:29:37.639 align:start position:0%
school and do the varsity game so it's
 
01:29:39.470 --> 01:29:39.480 align:start position:0%
it's not good and most of the people are
 
01:29:41.910 --> 01:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
getting aged out or they should be aged
 
01:29:43.149 --> 01:29:43.159 align:start position:0%
out when they're officiating but we're
 
01:29:45.550 --> 01:29:45.560 align:start position:0%
all hanging on uh because we like it
 
01:29:47.790 --> 01:29:47.800 align:start position:0%
and because the kids wouldn't be able to
 
01:29:49.510 --> 01:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
play so we don't want the parents
 
01:29:50.990 --> 01:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
running it for
 
01:29:54.950 --> 01:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
them uh representative Smith question
 
01:29:57.149 --> 01:29:57.159 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:29:57.159 --> 01:30:00.109 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
um

01:30:00.109 --> 01:30:00.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:02.870 --> 01:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh I I don't know whether I'm the bull
 
01:30:05.070 --> 01:30:05.080 align:start position:0%
in the china shop or another one of
 
01:30:07.510 --> 01:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
those the fly what's the other
 
01:30:09.510 --> 01:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
expression what whatever it is what I'm
 
01:30:12.270 --> 01:30:12.280 align:start position:0%
going to say is not going to be welcome
 
01:30:12.280 --> 01:30:13.070 align:start position:0%
going to say is not going to be welcome
I

01:30:13.070 --> 01:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:30:17.310 --> 01:30:17.320 align:start position:0%
know that sports are an important part
 
01:30:18.310 --> 01:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
of our
 
01:30:22.990 --> 01:30:23.000 align:start position:0%
society I know that our children learn
 
01:30:25.950 --> 01:30:25.960 align:start position:0%
an incredible amount by being able to
 
01:30:29.430 --> 01:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
play on teams they learn about working
 
01:30:33.310 --> 01:30:33.320 align:start position:0%
with others they learn physical skills
 
01:30:35.669 --> 01:30:35.679 align:start position:0%
they learn about winning and
 
01:30:40.830 --> 01:30:40.840 align:start position:0%
losing um and one hopes they learn good
 
01:30:40.840 --> 01:30:44.550 align:start position:0%
losing um and one hopes they learn good
behavior

01:30:44.550 --> 01:30:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:47.590 --> 01:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
um what makes me
 
01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:49.350 align:start position:0%
um what makes me
unhappy

01:30:49.350 --> 01:30:49.360 align:start position:0%
unhappy
 
01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:50.950 align:start position:0%
unhappy
today

01:30:50.950 --> 01:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:30:54.430 --> 01:30:54.440 align:start position:0%
is why are we looking at
 
01:31:00.270 --> 01:31:00.280 align:start position:0%
Sports and not looking at any other
 
01:31:04.350 --> 01:31:04.360 align:start position:0%
Gathering of people where the
 
01:31:08.229 --> 01:31:08.239 align:start position:0%
behavior um is not behavior that you or
 
01:31:10.350 --> 01:31:10.360 align:start position:0%
I would have ever
 
01:31:14.550 --> 01:31:14.560 align:start position:0%
seen a number of years ago um whether
 
01:31:20.430 --> 01:31:20.440 align:start position:0%
it's in a a theater a concert or a
 
01:31:23.390 --> 01:31:23.400 align:start position:0%
political Gathering where things are
 
01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:25.430 align:start position:0%
political Gathering where things are
said

01:31:25.430 --> 01:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:31:29.750 --> 01:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
um there's physical assault there's
 
01:31:33.070 --> 01:31:33.080 align:start position:0%
verbal assault that is the world that
 
01:31:35.950 --> 01:31:35.960 align:start position:0%
we're living in right now and it's
 
01:31:40.910 --> 01:31:40.920 align:start position:0%
wrong so as important as I think sports
 
01:31:43.950 --> 01:31:43.960 align:start position:0%
are in in our
 
01:31:46.430 --> 01:31:46.440 align:start position:0%
children's development and we're talking
 
01:31:50.830 --> 01:31:50.840 align:start position:0%
here you know about young people
 
01:31:53.550 --> 01:31:53.560 align:start position:0%
I I'm just really uncomfortable that
 
01:31:55.590 --> 01:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
we're spending a lot of time here
 
01:32:00.950 --> 01:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
talking about this which is the tiniest
 
01:32:03.470 --> 01:32:03.480 align:start position:0%
component of the problems that we are
 
01:32:07.550 --> 01:32:07.560 align:start position:0%
facing now in the world we're living in
 
01:32:10.669 --> 01:32:10.679 align:start position:0%
can you tell me where I'm wrong I don't
 
01:32:12.390 --> 01:32:12.400 align:start position:0%
think you're wrong but I I think the
 
01:32:14.790 --> 01:32:14.800 align:start position:0%
issue for us you know I don't speak for
 
01:32:16.550 --> 01:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
all officials but I think I speak for
 
01:32:18.430 --> 01:32:18.440 align:start position:0%
most of them on this point
 
01:32:21.550 --> 01:32:21.560 align:start position:0%
is if there's no authority to ban
 
01:32:23.629 --> 01:32:23.639 align:start position:0%
someone okay and then somebody comes up
 
01:32:25.870 --> 01:32:25.880 align:start position:0%
and pushes me and then they get
 
01:32:27.390 --> 01:32:27.400 align:start position:0%
prosecuted and they get a suspended as
 
01:32:29.109 --> 01:32:29.119 align:start position:0%
jail sentence and they can come back to
 
01:32:32.270 --> 01:32:32.280 align:start position:0%
the arena again that's problematic for
 
01:32:36.189 --> 01:32:36.199 align:start position:0%
us so we think that that we're unique in
 
01:32:36.199 --> 01:32:37.990 align:start position:0%
us so we think that that we're unique in
that

01:32:37.990 --> 01:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:32:40.109 --> 01:32:40.119 align:start position:0%
regard and that's why this bill is
 
01:32:41.149 --> 01:32:41.159 align:start position:0%
important for
 
01:32:43.870 --> 01:32:43.880 align:start position:0%
us you might be right that other bills
 
01:32:47.189 --> 01:32:47.199 align:start position:0%
could designate um other people as
 
01:32:50.030 --> 01:32:50.040 align:start position:0%
victims or other groups as victims and
 
01:32:52.709 --> 01:32:52.719 align:start position:0%
that would be fine but we think for us
 
01:32:55.070 --> 01:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
the time has come to have that little
 
01:32:57.430 --> 01:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
tool in the toolbox that people know
 
01:33:00.109 --> 01:33:00.119 align:start position:0%
about where they they're not coming back
 
01:33:02.550 --> 01:33:02.560 align:start position:0%
they if they don't behave
 
01:33:04.790 --> 01:33:04.800 align:start position:0%
properly thank you that shows why you're
 
01:33:08.669 --> 01:33:08.679 align:start position:0%
a good Advocate representative
 
01:33:11.310 --> 01:33:11.320 align:start position:0%
trip uh I think you brought up a an
 
01:33:14.310 --> 01:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
excellent comment on uh section three
 
01:33:20.109 --> 01:33:20.119 align:start position:0%
but uh uh you know but uh I just have a
 
01:33:24.390 --> 01:33:24.400 align:start position:0%
question on attendance Pro prohibition
 
01:33:27.709 --> 01:33:27.719 align:start position:0%
uh do you have any suggestions on uh how
 
01:33:28.709 --> 01:33:28.719 align:start position:0%
this would be
 
01:33:32.070 --> 01:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
enforced uh especially you
 
01:33:34.669 --> 01:33:34.679 align:start position:0%
know if you're banned
 
01:33:39.950 --> 01:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
from uh say a home game how would uh the
 
01:33:42.350 --> 01:33:42.360 align:start position:0%
officials at the away game know that the
 
01:33:44.229 --> 01:33:44.239 align:start position:0%
person is banned or or does that
 
01:33:44.239 --> 01:33:46.350 align:start position:0%
person is banned or or does that
actually

01:33:46.350 --> 01:33:46.360 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:33:48.990 --> 01:33:49.000 align:start position:0%
apply I think I think word would get
 
01:33:51.149 --> 01:33:51.159 align:start position:0%
around it's it's just like anything else
 
01:33:53.550 --> 01:33:53.560 align:start position:0%
in our business you client I used to be
 
01:33:56.030 --> 01:33:56.040 align:start position:0%
a public defenders get restrictions on
 
01:33:58.189 --> 01:33:58.199 align:start position:0%
certain things that that people couldn't
 
01:34:02.910 --> 01:34:02.920 align:start position:0%
do um and usually people know about them
 
01:34:05.070 --> 01:34:05.080 align:start position:0%
so I so I would guess that if we knew
 
01:34:07.470 --> 01:34:07.480 align:start position:0%
that that a particular person couldn't
 
01:34:09.350 --> 01:34:09.360 align:start position:0%
go to a sporting event we would probably
 
01:34:11.550 --> 01:34:11.560 align:start position:0%
disseminate that information through the
 
01:34:11.560 --> 01:34:16.350 align:start position:0%
disseminate that information through the
athletic

01:34:16.350 --> 01:34:16.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:18.830 --> 01:34:18.840 align:start position:0%
directors representative oh I'm sorry
 
01:34:21.149 --> 01:34:21.159 align:start position:0%
you want to follow up follow up please
 
01:34:24.310 --> 01:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
so so you don't propose that we have a a
 
01:34:28.790 --> 01:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
a list that is uh propagated by
 
01:34:32.709 --> 01:34:32.719 align:start position:0%
uh people that are convicted of banned
 
01:34:34.590 --> 01:34:34.600 align:start position:0%
from uh
 
01:34:38.550 --> 01:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
uh athletic events distributed to uh all
 
01:34:41.189 --> 01:34:41.199 align:start position:0%
the schools so that they would be a
 
01:34:43.149 --> 01:34:43.159 align:start position:0%
mechanism for enforcement you mean like
 
01:34:46.750 --> 01:34:46.760 align:start position:0%
a registry yes um personally I would
 
01:34:50.149 --> 01:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
rather maybe see the nhiaa get involved
 
01:34:52.830 --> 01:34:52.840 align:start position:0%
where we could report that somehow to
 
01:34:54.350 --> 01:34:54.360 align:start position:0%
the NHA
 
01:34:55.990 --> 01:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
and they send out an email to their
 
01:34:58.510 --> 01:34:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:01.790 --> 01:35:01.800 align:start position:0%
schools okay thank you my guess would my
 
01:35:03.550 --> 01:35:03.560 align:start position:0%
guess would be if you're a parent and
 
01:35:05.430 --> 01:35:05.440 align:start position:0%
you're banned from a school and you've
 
01:35:06.790 --> 01:35:06.800 align:start position:0%
been in front of a judge and you have a
 
01:35:08.709 --> 01:35:08.719 align:start position:0%
suspended sentence you're probably not
 
01:35:10.030 --> 01:35:10.040 align:start position:0%
going to go to another game unless
 
01:35:12.390 --> 01:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
you're a complete idiot and if you're a
 
01:35:13.830 --> 01:35:13.840 align:start position:0%
complete idiot you're probably going to
 
01:35:15.550 --> 01:35:15.560 align:start position:0%
get caught based upon my experience in
 
01:35:17.870 --> 01:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
dealing with people
 
01:35:20.350 --> 01:35:20.360 align:start position:0%
so representative
 
01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:21.990 align:start position:0%
so representative
kab

01:35:21.990 --> 01:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
kab
 
01:35:24.870 --> 01:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
sorry I guess I guess yeah you had
 
01:35:28.149 --> 01:35:28.159 align:start position:0%
another followup go ahead uh Sor so I
 
01:35:31.390 --> 01:35:31.400 align:start position:0%
guess uh is there additional penalties
 
01:35:35.550 --> 01:35:35.560 align:start position:0%
for repeat violations of uh attending
 
01:35:38.149 --> 01:35:38.159 align:start position:0%
games when you're banned from games on
 
01:35:40.550 --> 01:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
on this proposal it's up to a year for
 
01:35:42.910 --> 01:35:42.920 align:start position:0%
the first offense and up to life a
 
01:35:45.149 --> 01:35:45.159 align:start position:0%
lifetime ban
 
01:35:47.390 --> 01:35:47.400 align:start position:0%
thereafter up to a lifetime ban all
 
01:35:49.990 --> 01:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
right thank you representative
 
01:35:52.629 --> 01:35:52.639 align:start position:0%
kab thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:35:55.350 --> 01:35:55.360 align:start position:0%
for taking my question attorney I wanted
 
01:35:58.390 --> 01:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
to ask relative to line
 
01:36:01.790 --> 01:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
25 it says under this section from
 
01:36:04.310 --> 01:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
acting as a participant at a sports
 
01:36:06.430 --> 01:36:06.440 align:start position:0%
event and when you were discussing it
 
01:36:10.189 --> 01:36:10.199 align:start position:0%
you were discussing it in the context
 
01:36:12.669 --> 01:36:12.679 align:start position:0%
of coming as an attendee and I just
 
01:36:14.350 --> 01:36:14.360 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask in your opinion as an
 
01:36:16.550 --> 01:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
attorney do you think that it's clear
 
01:36:18.470 --> 01:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
that we're not that the language that's
 
01:36:20.550 --> 01:36:20.560 align:start position:0%
used doesn't just mean from acting as
 
01:36:22.590 --> 01:36:22.600 align:start position:0%
like a participant in the sporting event
 
01:36:24.550 --> 01:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
and that it actually means
 
01:36:27.550 --> 01:36:27.560 align:start position:0%
means you know being an attendee as well
 
01:36:28.709 --> 01:36:28.719 align:start position:0%
or do you think that that language
 
01:36:31.109 --> 01:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
should be clarified a little bit well if
 
01:36:34.750 --> 01:36:34.760 align:start position:0%
you look up at uh number 11 uh and I'm
 
01:36:37.189 --> 01:36:37.199 align:start position:0%
sure Kevin had discussed this when he
 
01:36:40.709 --> 01:36:40.719 align:start position:0%
spoke with Senator delandro participant
 
01:36:44.350 --> 01:36:44.360 align:start position:0%
has been defined in its uh pretty uh
 
01:36:47.790 --> 01:36:47.800 align:start position:0%
allinclusive okay thank you sure right
 
01:36:49.830 --> 01:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
representative Wallace thank you Mr
 
01:36:51.590 --> 01:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
01:36:54.870 --> 01:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
have you considered um a single parent
 
01:36:57.950 --> 01:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
family with a student athlete being
 
01:36:59.910 --> 01:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
banned and what uh negative impact this
 
01:37:01.990 --> 01:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
would have on parental rights in that
 
01:37:04.270 --> 01:37:04.280 align:start position:0%
set of circumstances and what do you
 
01:37:05.550 --> 01:37:05.560 align:start position:0%
think the response is going to be in
 
01:37:07.709 --> 01:37:07.719 align:start position:0%
that situation I've thought about it but
 
01:37:09.750 --> 01:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
by the way I just want to say paretic I
 
01:37:11.590 --> 01:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
I'm I hope I live long enough so I'm in
 
01:37:14.390 --> 01:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
court and the judge says to me um thank
 
01:37:16.430 --> 01:37:16.440 align:start position:0%
you for uh answering my question or
 
01:37:21.470 --> 01:37:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:24.310 --> 01:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
uh this this is this this is how I would
 
01:37:27.189 --> 01:37:27.199 align:start position:0%
answer your question the parent is not
 
01:37:29.709 --> 01:37:29.719 align:start position:0%
being penalized because they're a single
 
01:37:32.950 --> 01:37:32.960 align:start position:0%
parent the parent is being penalized for
 
01:37:35.189 --> 01:37:35.199 align:start position:0%
what they have done they've committed a
 
01:37:37.310 --> 01:37:37.320 align:start position:0%
crime so think of it this way so the
 
01:37:39.589 --> 01:37:39.599 align:start position:0%
parent goes to a the parent goes to a
 
01:37:41.030 --> 01:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
wedding drinks a little bit too much
 
01:37:43.030 --> 01:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
gets caught for drunk driving and ends
 
01:37:45.390 --> 01:37:45.400 align:start position:0%
up losing his or her license either for
 
01:37:47.629 --> 01:37:47.639 align:start position:0%
drunk driving or reckless driving and
 
01:37:49.109 --> 01:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
then the parents said well GE wi I'm a
 
01:37:51.430 --> 01:37:51.440 align:start position:0%
single parent I can't take my kids to to
 
01:37:53.189 --> 01:37:53.199 align:start position:0%
the games and I can't take my kids to
 
01:37:53.199 --> 01:37:54.350 align:start position:0%
the games and I can't take my kids to
practice

01:37:54.350 --> 01:37:54.360 align:start position:0%
practice
 
01:37:56.870 --> 01:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
that's not fair to my kid right it isn't
 
01:37:58.270 --> 01:37:58.280 align:start position:0%
fair to your kid and it's not fair to
 
01:38:01.270 --> 01:38:01.280 align:start position:0%
your kid because of what you did you
 
01:38:02.430 --> 01:38:02.440 align:start position:0%
broke the
 
01:38:05.950 --> 01:38:05.960 align:start position:0%
law so maybe if people are worried about
 
01:38:07.629 --> 01:38:07.639 align:start position:0%
that they'll act
 
01:38:09.950 --> 01:38:09.960 align:start position:0%
better or they'll get their friends to
 
01:38:13.310 --> 01:38:13.320 align:start position:0%
drive them but you know every every
 
01:38:15.709 --> 01:38:15.719 align:start position:0%
criminal prosecution has a
 
01:38:20.070 --> 01:38:20.080 align:start position:0%
consequence um to the victim and to the
 
01:38:22.990 --> 01:38:23.000 align:start position:0%
defendant and that's that that's just
 
01:38:25.830 --> 01:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
the process that we have
 
01:38:28.910 --> 01:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
you about follow up sure thank you uh in
 
01:38:32.310 --> 01:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
the um example that you gave uh would
 
01:38:35.070 --> 01:38:35.080 align:start position:0%
you agree that um an individual having
 
01:38:36.669 --> 01:38:36.679 align:start position:0%
too much to drink and driving on the
 
01:38:38.950 --> 01:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
public roads is a hazard to the general
 
01:38:40.910 --> 01:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
public where the individual in this
 
01:38:43.750 --> 01:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
particular bill would be maybe uh you
 
01:38:45.950 --> 01:38:45.960 align:start position:0%
know aggressive or assaulting to one
 
01:38:47.790 --> 01:38:47.800 align:start position:0%
individual oh sure they're different
 
01:38:49.669 --> 01:38:49.679 align:start position:0%
yeah they difference in in degrees I
 
01:38:51.870 --> 01:38:51.880 align:start position:0%
think I was looking at the language here
 
01:38:53.629 --> 01:38:53.639 align:start position:0%
the way the language is written in
 
01:38:53.639 --> 01:38:55.589 align:start position:0%
the way the language is written in
paragraph

01:38:55.589 --> 01:38:55.599 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
01:38:55.599 --> 01:39:03.910 align:start position:0%
paragraph
three

01:39:03.910 --> 01:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:06.950 --> 01:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
um I I don't think it's mandatory it
 
01:39:10.149 --> 01:39:10.159 align:start position:0%
says in addition the court May prohibit
 
01:39:12.350 --> 01:39:12.360 align:start position:0%
it's May right so you think the Optics
 
01:39:15.950 --> 01:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
of it be uh problematic you know
 
01:39:17.270 --> 01:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
prohibiting parents from attending their
 
01:39:19.109 --> 01:39:19.119 align:start position:0%
kids games well well I think if there's
 
01:39:21.350 --> 01:39:21.360 align:start position:0%
a compelling reason like if it's an if
 
01:39:23.750 --> 01:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
it's an an adoration a person has lived
 
01:39:26.589 --> 01:39:26.599 align:start position:0%
a good life he's never been a problem uh
 
01:39:28.229 --> 01:39:28.239 align:start position:0%
if he's going through some stresses he
 
01:39:30.470 --> 01:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
get he gets you to the game and then the
 
01:39:32.629 --> 01:39:32.639 align:start position:0%
referee's walking by and grabs his
 
01:39:34.629 --> 01:39:34.639 align:start position:0%
shoulder and says hey you know you're
 
01:39:37.550 --> 01:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
gonna my kid this is important you know
 
01:39:39.709 --> 01:39:39.719 align:start position:0%
you know I get that it's not right I get
 
01:39:42.350 --> 01:39:42.360 align:start position:0%
I get that so maybe when he's sentenced
 
01:39:44.430 --> 01:39:44.440 align:start position:0%
the judge says yeah I'm not going to
 
01:39:45.990 --> 01:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
prevent you from going to your kids game
 
01:39:48.430 --> 01:39:48.440 align:start position:0%
but if but if the next guy comes in and
 
01:39:50.750 --> 01:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
he's been a problem the whole year I
 
01:39:52.589 --> 01:39:52.599 align:start position:0%
think you treat him differently and
 
01:39:55.149 --> 01:39:55.159 align:start position:0%
that's the way the system work so there
 
01:39:58.229 --> 01:39:58.239 align:start position:0%
there's your safety valve right
 
01:40:01.229 --> 01:40:01.239 align:start position:0%
there thank you sure other other
 
01:40:03.830 --> 01:40:03.840 align:start position:0%

Franklin um we've gotten some initial
 
01:41:57.950 --> 01:41:57.960 align:start position:0%
feedback from the uh from the pilot and
 
01:41:59.950 --> 01:41:59.960 align:start position:0%
it really was a small but meaningful
 
01:42:02.430 --> 01:42:02.440 align:start position:0%
step for better access to justice for
 
01:42:05.790 --> 01:42:05.800 align:start position:0%
lowincome granite Staters it limits the
 
01:42:08.870 --> 01:42:08.880 align:start position:0%

Hearing in that in the Senate I learned

that again it's it's working and it's
 
01:42:35.270 --> 01:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
working very well we did put in an
 
01:42:37.030 --> 01:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
amendment um because there was a
 
01:42:40.109 --> 01:42:40.119 align:start position:0%
question concerning um a report that was
 
01:42:42.510 --> 01:42:42.520 align:start position:0%
due and the committee Senate Judiciary
 
01:42:45.350 --> 01:42:45.360 align:start position:0%
felt that it was important that we be
 
01:42:48.550 --> 01:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
able to keep tabs on this program um we
 
01:42:49.950 --> 01:42:49.960 align:start position:0%
made the
 
01:42:53.589 --> 01:42:53.599 align:start position:0%
2025 report an interm report and then we
 
01:42:56.109 --> 01:42:56.119 align:start position:0%
required a report at the end of the
 
01:42:59.109 --> 01:42:59.119 align:start position:0%
5-year period which I believe is
 
01:43:01.910 --> 01:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
2029 um at that point Mr chair at this
 
01:43:04.510 --> 01:43:04.520 align:start position:0%

to Justice Commission that work closely
 
01:44:26.950 --> 01:44:26.960 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire legal assistance in
 
01:44:29.390 --> 01:44:29.400 align:start position:0%
originally developing and promoting the
 
01:44:32.030 --> 01:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
idea that's embodied in this legislation
 
01:44:32.990 --> 01:44:33.000 align:start position:0%
and was
 
01:44:36.709 --> 01:44:36.719 align:start position:0%
embodied in-house Bill 1343 two years
 
01:44:39.709 --> 01:44:39.719 align:start position:0%
ago which was groundbreaking legislation
 
01:44:42.910 --> 01:44:42.920 align:start position:0%
to establish a pilot program permitting
 
01:44:44.790 --> 01:44:44.800 align:start position:0%
par professionals to provide Legal
 
01:44:47.870 --> 01:44:47.880 align:start position:0%
Services Under supervision of a licensed
 
01:44:50.830 --> 01:44:50.840 align:start position:0%
attorney the effective date was January
 
01:44:54.189 --> 01:44:54.199 align:start position:0%
1 uh 2023
 
01:44:57.629 --> 01:44:57.639 align:start position:0%
and that bill itself was the product of
 
01:45:00.669 --> 01:45:00.679 align:start position:0%
considerable uh work and Del
 
01:45:04.430 --> 01:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
deliberative process uh in many branches
 
01:45:07.910 --> 01:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
particularly over in the legislature um
 
01:45:10.270 --> 01:45:10.280 align:start position:0%
there was a study committee I know
 
01:45:12.790 --> 01:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
representative uh judge Senator Gordon
 
01:45:15.629 --> 01:45:15.639 align:start position:0%
is here I know he was very involved
 
01:45:17.430 --> 01:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
through that process it couldn't have
 
01:45:20.470 --> 01:45:20.480 align:start position:0%
happened without him uh the access to
 
01:45:23.709 --> 01:45:23.719 align:start position:0%
Justice Commission supported the
 
01:45:27.149 --> 01:45:27.159 align:start position:0%
development of the um in the study
 
01:45:28.950 --> 01:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
committee and the
 
01:45:33.109 --> 01:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
legislation and then uh after passage of
 
01:45:37.709 --> 01:45:37.719 align:start position:0%
the U Bill uh we had to undertake uh
 
01:45:40.390 --> 01:45:40.400 align:start position:0%
rulemaking at the court in order to make
 
01:45:42.790 --> 01:45:42.800 align:start position:0%
this possible but all of that happened
 
01:45:47.750 --> 01:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
so that it was in effect January of
 
01:45:52.350 --> 01:45:52.360 align:start position:0%
2023 uh as um Senator Carson said this
 
01:45:55.470 --> 01:45:55.480 align:start position:0%
bill would extend the sunset de Sunset
 
01:46:00.270 --> 01:46:00.280 align:start position:0%
date to 2030 and expand the program to
 
01:46:02.310 --> 01:46:02.320 align:start position:0%
Statewide to all the circuit
 
01:46:05.510 --> 01:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
courts um we we at the court urge
 
01:46:09.149 --> 01:46:09.159 align:start position:0%
approval for three reasons first um in
 
01:46:11.430 --> 01:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
the first year it has been an operation
 
01:46:14.189 --> 01:46:14.199 align:start position:0%
the pilot has shown promise based on
 
01:46:17.350 --> 01:46:17.360 align:start position:0%
reports filed with our court the program
 
01:46:21.669 --> 01:46:21.679 align:start position:0%
has been used in 11 cases I think uh the
 
01:46:23.390 --> 01:46:23.400 align:start position:0%
executive director of New Hampshire
 
01:46:25.109 --> 01:46:25.119 align:start position:0%
legal assistants can update those
 
01:46:27.629 --> 01:46:27.639 align:start position:0%
numbers when she
 
01:46:30.470 --> 01:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
testified uh on based on the data that
 
01:46:32.390 --> 01:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
we have those cases involve were
 
01:46:35.790 --> 01:46:35.800 align:start position:0%
domestic violence cases um Circuit Court
 
01:46:38.390 --> 01:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
administrative judge king reports that
 
01:46:41.310 --> 01:46:41.320 align:start position:0%
all has gone smoothly and one of our
 
01:46:43.550 --> 01:46:43.560 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court judges Kim shabo has
 
01:46:46.790 --> 01:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
conducted several hearings involving PA
 
01:46:48.830 --> 01:46:48.840 align:start position:0%
professionals she reports that they've G
 
01:46:51.589 --> 01:46:51.599 align:start position:0%
done a good job and that their presence
 
01:46:54.189 --> 01:46:54.199 align:start position:0%
has been beneficial to the court and to
 
01:46:57.510 --> 01:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
the litigant second as promising as the
 
01:47:01.189 --> 01:47:01.199 align:start position:0%
initial reports are uh we believe it
 
01:47:03.270 --> 01:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
would be better to have more experience
 
01:47:04.589 --> 01:47:04.599 align:start position:0%
before we make a
 
01:47:07.030 --> 01:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
recommendation as to what should come
 
01:47:09.669 --> 01:47:09.679 align:start position:0%
next uh we would particularly like to
 
01:47:12.030 --> 01:47:12.040 align:start position:0%
have more experience in other case types
 
01:47:14.589 --> 01:47:14.599 align:start position:0%
including marital parenting and landlord
 
01:47:17.550 --> 01:47:17.560 align:start position:0%
tenant and third the need that inspired
 
01:47:17.560 --> 01:47:18.550 align:start position:0%
tenant and third the need that inspired
this

01:47:18.550 --> 01:47:18.560 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:47:21.510 --> 01:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
legislation the a the access to Justice
 
01:47:23.870 --> 01:47:23.880 align:start position:0%
gap between those who who need legal
 
01:47:26.270 --> 01:47:26.280 align:start position:0%
representation and those who cannot have
 
01:47:31.310 --> 01:47:31.320 align:start position:0%
it remains U achingly large as ever only
 
01:47:33.709 --> 01:47:33.719 align:start position:0%
about 15% of the litigants in our
 
01:47:36.470 --> 01:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
circuit courts have legal representation
 
01:47:37.629 --> 01:47:37.639 align:start position:0%
and considering that there are
 
01:47:41.229 --> 01:47:41.239 align:start position:0%
approximately 12,000 filings in the
 
01:47:43.550 --> 01:47:43.560 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court every year the numbers of
 
01:47:46.430 --> 01:47:46.440 align:start position:0%
self-represented litigant are
 
01:47:50.870 --> 01:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
staggering but the sum of uh those
 
01:47:54.310 --> 01:47:54.320 align:start position:0%
numbers uh doesn't really reflect the
 
01:47:57.550 --> 01:47:57.560 align:start position:0%
basic human needs and they're that these
 
01:48:00.149 --> 01:48:00.159 align:start position:0%
people are operating with an un in an
 
01:48:03.470 --> 01:48:03.480 align:start position:0%
unfamiliar system and need assistance
 
01:48:05.629 --> 01:48:05.639 align:start position:0%
and this is one way to do it the access
 
01:48:08.470 --> 01:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
to Justice Commission is taking a
 
01:48:11.910 --> 01:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
holistic view of the self-represented
 
01:48:14.910 --> 01:48:14.920 align:start position:0%
litigant issue we have lots of different
 
01:48:17.149 --> 01:48:17.159 align:start position:0%
initiatives right now but this is a very
 
01:48:20.030 --> 01:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
important one so thanks to this
 
01:48:22.830 --> 01:48:22.840 align:start position:0%
legislation um in about 10 or so
 
01:48:26.589 --> 01:48:26.599 align:start position:0%
instances during the past year and three
 
01:48:29.470 --> 01:48:29.480 align:start position:0%
months two months a victim of domestic
 
01:48:31.550 --> 01:48:31.560 align:start position:0%
violence was there with a trained
 
01:48:33.790 --> 01:48:33.800 align:start position:0%
professional providing assistance when
 
01:48:36.350 --> 01:48:36.360 align:start position:0%
that would not have otherwise been the
 
01:48:40.589 --> 01:48:40.599 align:start position:0%
case we uh did suggest in the Senate and
 
01:48:43.030 --> 01:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
the Senate did adopt the amendment to
 
01:48:45.750 --> 01:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
have the 2025 report be an interim
 
01:48:48.669 --> 01:48:48.679 align:start position:0%
report and the final report uh when we
 
01:48:51.470 --> 01:48:51.480 align:start position:0%
have much more data and experience be in
 
01:48:54.470 --> 01:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
2029 so I'm here to voice the
 
01:48:56.550 --> 01:48:56.560 align:start position:0%
wholehearted support of the access to
 
01:48:59.070 --> 01:48:59.080 align:start position:0%
Justice Commission and the New Hampshire
 
01:49:01.189 --> 01:49:01.199 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court and I'm happy to answer
 
01:49:01.199 --> 01:49:02.030 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court and I'm happy to answer
any

01:49:02.030 --> 01:49:02.040 align:start position:0%

Gordon I live in
 
01:49:44.550 --> 01:49:44.560 align:start position:0%
Bristol and I am a retired circuit court
 
01:49:46.910 --> 01:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
judge I sat in the circuit court for 13
 
01:49:49.870 --> 01:49:49.880 align:start position:0%
years 12 years I served as a family
 
01:49:51.390 --> 01:49:51.400 align:start position:0%
court judge I was one of the first
 
01:49:53.510 --> 01:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
judges to volunteer for the Family Court
 
01:49:56.830 --> 01:49:56.840 align:start position:0%
after it was integrated into the Circuit
 
01:49:59.070 --> 01:49:59.080 align:start position:0%
Court um I think this is a very
 
01:50:01.310 --> 01:50:01.320 align:start position:0%
important bill I sponsored the original
 
01:50:05.149 --> 01:50:05.159 align:start position:0%
Bill uh creating the pilot
 
01:50:08.669 --> 01:50:08.679 align:start position:0%
program I think uh you've already heard
 
01:50:12.950 --> 01:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
the reasons uh well well spoken by the
 
01:50:14.550 --> 01:50:14.560 align:start position:0%
senator and
 
01:50:16.910 --> 01:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
Justice I think another five years would
 
01:50:18.510 --> 01:50:18.520 align:start position:0%
be great I think one of the things I'd
 
01:50:20.390 --> 01:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
like to see is right now legal
 
01:50:21.950 --> 01:50:21.960 align:start position:0%
assistance has been providing these
 
01:50:24.270 --> 01:50:24.280 align:start position:0%
types of services is I'd like to see if
 
01:50:26.910 --> 01:50:26.920 align:start position:0%
we had a 5-year window perhaps some
 
01:50:26.920 --> 01:50:28.189 align:start position:0%
we had a 5-year window perhaps some
private

01:50:28.189 --> 01:50:28.199 align:start position:0%
private
 
01:50:31.910 --> 01:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
practitioners uh being involved as well
 
01:50:34.629 --> 01:50:34.639 align:start position:0%
I think that that would be uh uh
 
01:50:36.030 --> 01:50:36.040 align:start position:0%
interesting and I'd like to have the
 
01:50:38.589 --> 01:50:38.599 align:start position:0%
opportunity to see that happen I think
 
01:50:41.830 --> 01:50:41.840 align:start position:0%
the whole I think we can all agree that
 
01:50:43.470 --> 01:50:43.480 align:start position:0%
the one thing that we want our court
 
01:50:46.669 --> 01:50:46.679 align:start position:0%
systems to do is to to provide Justice
 
01:50:50.149 --> 01:50:50.159 align:start position:0%
and right now we have we have this
 
01:50:53.109 --> 01:50:53.119 align:start position:0%
structure this uh Paradigm this uh we
 
01:50:55.589 --> 01:50:55.599 align:start position:0%
have attorneys and we have
 
01:50:59.830 --> 01:50:59.840 align:start position:0%
paralegals and unfortunately what we've
 
01:51:02.629 --> 01:51:02.639 align:start position:0%
doing right now from my perspective is
 
01:51:05.510 --> 01:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
we're trying to make Justice fit this
 
01:51:05.520 --> 01:51:06.870 align:start position:0%
we're trying to make Justice fit this
professional

01:51:06.870 --> 01:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
professional
 
01:51:09.870 --> 01:51:09.880 align:start position:0%
structure and I think what we're trying
 
01:51:13.189 --> 01:51:13.199 align:start position:0%
to do or what the effort is made with
 
01:51:16.350 --> 01:51:16.360 align:start position:0%
regard to this particular pilot program
 
01:51:19.510 --> 01:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
is to try to make the structure provide
 
01:51:19.520 --> 01:51:20.750 align:start position:0%
is to try to make the structure provide
for

01:51:20.750 --> 01:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:51:24.830 --> 01:51:24.840 align:start position:0%
justice and I think we can look at the
 
01:51:27.310 --> 01:51:27.320 align:start position:0%
um medical profession probably as a good
 
01:51:29.229 --> 01:51:29.239 align:start position:0%
example because they had a structure a
 
01:51:31.870 --> 01:51:31.880 align:start position:0%
paradigm they had doctors and nurses and
 
01:51:36.790 --> 01:51:36.800 align:start position:0%
50 years ago and what they did was say
 
01:51:40.149 --> 01:51:40.159 align:start position:0%
over time what they've come to learn is
 
01:51:42.910 --> 01:51:42.920 align:start position:0%
that uh what you do is you should make
 
01:51:42.920 --> 01:51:44.550 align:start position:0%
that uh what you do is you should make
people's

01:51:44.550 --> 01:51:44.560 align:start position:0%
people's
 
01:51:47.069 --> 01:51:47.079 align:start position:0%
qualifications fit fit the skills that
 
01:51:49.830 --> 01:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
are needed to do a particular
 
01:51:52.669 --> 01:51:52.679 align:start position:0%
job and we're not doing a good job at
 
01:51:55.189 --> 01:51:55.199 align:start position:0%
that in the medical industry what they
 
01:51:57.510 --> 01:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
did do they had doctors and nurses now
 
01:51:59.950 --> 01:51:59.960 align:start position:0%
they have nurse practitioners they have
 
01:51:59.960 --> 01:52:01.149 align:start position:0%
they have nurse practitioners they have
Physicians

01:52:01.149 --> 01:52:01.159 align:start position:0%
Physicians
 
01:52:04.109 --> 01:52:04.119 align:start position:0%
assistants they have a whole structure
 
01:52:05.950 --> 01:52:05.960 align:start position:0%
who thought 20 years ago your pharmacist
 
01:52:07.870 --> 01:52:07.880 align:start position:0%
would be giving you your
 
01:52:10.629 --> 01:52:10.639 align:start position:0%
shots the fact is that you try to match
 
01:52:16.149 --> 01:52:16.159 align:start position:0%
skill level with what uh is required and
 
01:52:17.870 --> 01:52:17.880 align:start position:0%
I think this is the direction that the
 
01:52:19.990 --> 01:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
legal profession needs to go in and it's
 
01:52:22.870 --> 01:52:22.880 align:start position:0%
the direction our courts need to go in
 
01:52:25.270 --> 01:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
and I think the pilot program is an
 
01:52:28.990 --> 01:52:29.000 align:start position:0%
effort to begin that process to make
 
01:52:33.310 --> 01:52:33.320 align:start position:0%
that happen to make that work and I just
 
01:52:35.550 --> 01:52:35.560 align:start position:0%
encourage you to support the bill I
 
01:52:37.629 --> 01:52:37.639 align:start position:0%
think it's in uh the state's best
 
01:52:40.669 --> 01:52:40.679 align:start position:0%
interest and the populations the state
 
01:52:43.470 --> 01:52:43.480 align:start position:0%
best interest and thank you very much
 
01:52:46.229 --> 01:52:46.239 align:start position:0%
thank you questions U representative
 
01:52:48.629 --> 01:52:48.639 align:start position:0%
Kat thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:52:51.270 --> 01:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question so I see in the
 
01:52:53.790 --> 01:52:53.800 align:start position:0%
original Statue that court
 
01:52:56.030 --> 01:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
rules kind dictate the manage of
 
01:52:57.790 --> 01:52:57.800 align:start position:0%
practice so I I guess I'm wondering does
 
01:53:00.030 --> 01:53:00.040 align:start position:0%
that I know you mentioned currently that
 
01:53:02.109 --> 01:53:02.119 align:start position:0%
the par professionals are practicing
 
01:53:04.910 --> 01:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
under New Hampshire legal aid do the
 
01:53:06.669 --> 01:53:06.679 align:start position:0%
court rules established currently that
 
01:53:08.069 --> 01:53:08.079 align:start position:0%
it has to be under New Hampshire legal
 
01:53:10.149 --> 01:53:10.159 align:start position:0%
aid or does it currently allow for
 
01:53:12.350 --> 01:53:12.360 align:start position:0%
private attorneys to allow par
 
01:53:13.430 --> 01:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
professionals but they're just not
 
01:53:18.109 --> 01:53:18.119 align:start position:0%
currently doing so uh it allows for uh
 
01:53:20.189 --> 01:53:20.199 align:start position:0%
for paralegals to practice under the
 
01:53:22.109 --> 01:53:22.119 align:start position:0%
offices of an attorney it's not limited
 
01:53:22.119 --> 01:53:23.669 align:start position:0%
offices of an attorney it's not limited
to

01:53:23.669 --> 01:53:23.679 align:start position:0%

of the current paraprofessional pilot
 
01:54:54.390 --> 01:54:54.400 align:start position:0%
program p&amp; has supported and championed
 
01:54:56.390 --> 01:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
this program since its infancy and we
 
01:54:58.390 --> 01:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
will continue to do so as this program
 
01:55:01.470 --> 01:55:01.480 align:start position:0%
grows throughout our state like you we
 
01:55:03.390 --> 01:55:03.400 align:start position:0%
are well aware of the continued need to
 
01:55:05.470 --> 01:55:05.480 align:start position:0%
ensure access to justice for
 
01:55:07.629 --> 01:55:07.639 align:start position:0%
self-represented litigants and others
 
01:55:09.750 --> 01:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
who require both legal advice and
 
01:55:11.550 --> 01:55:11.560 align:start position:0%

navigating our court systems
 
01:55:16.510 --> 01:55:16.520 align:start position:0%
additionally we at P&amp;H keep an eye on
 
01:55:17.950 --> 01:55:17.960 align:start position:0%
Trends in the paralal profession
 
01:55:20.189 --> 01:55:20.199 align:start position:0%
Nationwide it is clear that New
 
01:55:22.069 --> 01:55:22.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has been at the Forefront of
 
01:55:24.229 --> 01:55:24.239 align:start position:0%
was what is becoming a nationwide trend
 
01:55:25.910 --> 01:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
of States creating similar pilot
 
01:55:28.189 --> 01:55:28.199 align:start position:0%
programs for their own paraprofessionals
 
01:55:30.589 --> 01:55:30.599 align:start position:0%
and paralegals these programs are the
 
01:55:33.069 --> 01:55:33.079 align:start position:0%
future and by passing this bill today
 
01:55:34.550 --> 01:55:34.560 align:start position:0%
you are ensuring that New Hampshire
 
01:55:36.030 --> 01:55:36.040 align:start position:0%
remains in step with other states around
 
01:55:38.069 --> 01:55:38.079 align:start position:0%
the country you set a model for other
 
01:55:40.229 --> 01:55:40.239 align:start position:0%
states to follow and you are ensuring
 
01:55:43.109 --> 01:55:43.119 align:start position:0%
that highly qualified well-educated
 
01:55:45.430 --> 01:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
non-lawyer legal professionals such as
 
01:55:47.870 --> 01:55:47.880 align:start position:0%
myself are able to use our training and
 
01:55:49.950 --> 01:55:49.960 align:start position:0%
professional experience to assist those
 
01:55:52.030 --> 01:55:52.040 align:start position:0%
who need it most so I thank you for your
 
01:55:53.550 --> 01:55:53.560 align:start position:0%
time and it's my sincerest hope that
 
01:55:55.510 --> 01:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
you'll pass this Bill thank you thank
 
01:55:56.990 --> 01:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
you very much there questions for this
 
01:55:59.470 --> 01:55:59.480 align:start position:0%
witness yes representative Manos thank
 
01:56:01.629 --> 01:56:01.639 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:56:04.310 --> 01:56:04.320 align:start position:0%
question I was wondering the bill refers
 
01:56:07.069 --> 01:56:07.079 align:start position:0%
to par professionals and I was wondering
 
01:56:08.750 --> 01:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
the distinction between par
 
01:56:11.310 --> 01:56:11.320 align:start position:0%
professionals and paral
 
01:56:14.149 --> 01:56:14.159 align:start position:0%
leals I think it depends on the context
 
01:56:16.270 --> 01:56:16.280 align:start position:0%
uh a non- lawyer Legal Professional
 
01:56:18.950 --> 01:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
could be a legal assistant um or a
 
01:56:21.550 --> 01:56:21.560 align:start position:0%
pargal I think the difference comes in
 
01:56:22.830 --> 01:56:22.840 align:start position:0%
the sense that
 
01:56:25.669 --> 01:56:25.679 align:start position:0%
as paralegals we have certain ethical
 
01:56:27.589 --> 01:56:27.599 align:start position:0%
obligations that we have to meet that
 
01:56:31.550 --> 01:56:31.560 align:start position:0%
legal assistants don't as well as our
 
01:56:33.669 --> 01:56:33.679 align:start position:0%
Education and Training are usually a
 
01:56:35.709 --> 01:56:35.719 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
01:56:40.189 --> 01:56:40.199 align:start position:0%
higher followup thank you so is it your
 
01:56:43.270 --> 01:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
understanding that this bill is that the
 
01:56:45.830 --> 01:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
use of par professionals actually refers
 
01:56:49.550 --> 01:56:49.560 align:start position:0%
to means paral leals rather than a legal
 
01:56:52.629 --> 01:56:52.639 align:start position:0%
assistant I believe the bill does state
 
01:56:55.629 --> 01:56:55.639 align:start position:0%
um paralegals I'm not uh familiar with
 
01:56:58.030 --> 01:56:58.040 align:start position:0%
the exact terminology um in that context
 
01:57:00.189 --> 01:57:00.199 align:start position:0%
but I would assume that based upon the
 
01:57:01.910 --> 01:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
educational requirements and things like
 
01:57:06.310 --> 01:57:06.320 align:start position:0%

01:57:15.589 --> 01:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
ahead so it's under RSA 311 colon 2-a
 
01:57:17.830 --> 01:57:17.840 align:start position:0%
that a par professional either has a
 
01:57:20.030 --> 01:57:20.040 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree in any field or an
 
01:57:21.910 --> 01:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
associates degree in a law law related
 
01:57:21.920 --> 01:57:22.790 align:start position:0%
associates degree in a law law related
field

01:57:22.790 --> 01:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
field
 
01:57:25.069 --> 01:57:25.079 align:start position:0%
and at least 2 years of work experience
 
01:57:27.069 --> 01:57:27.079 align:start position:0%
in a Law related setting with attorney
 
01:57:30.350 --> 01:57:30.360 align:start position:0%
supervision so that's how it's defined
 
01:57:30.360 --> 01:57:31.510 align:start position:0%
supervision so that's how it's defined
in

01:57:31.510 --> 01:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:57:34.750 --> 01:57:34.760 align:start position:0%
here could you just repeat the the
 
01:57:39.830 --> 01:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
citation yeah 311 colon 2- a I think
 
01:57:41.430 --> 01:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
it's a little confusing because this
 
01:57:43.109 --> 01:57:43.119 align:start position:0%
names the chapter and then you have to
 
01:57:45.189 --> 01:57:45.199 align:start position:0%
go and find the chapter of the bill to
 
01:57:49.550 --> 01:57:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:51.709 --> 01:57:51.719 align:start position:0%
number all right other questions for
 
01:57:53.310 --> 01:57:53.320 align:start position:0%
this we
 
01:57:55.030 --> 01:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much sir
 
01:57:56.390 --> 01:57:56.400 align:start position:0%

enthusiastic support of Senate Bill
 
01:58:44.390 --> 01:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
361 I think I can put a little more meat
 
01:58:46.310 --> 01:58:46.320 align:start position:0%
on the bones actually and answer to
 
01:58:49.069 --> 01:58:49.079 align:start position:0%
representative mano's question the term
 
01:58:51.470 --> 01:58:51.480 align:start position:0%
paralal um broadly speaking in New
 
01:58:54.430 --> 01:58:54.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is not not one that is defined
 
01:58:57.589 --> 01:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
either by Statute or by Court rule um so
 
01:59:00.310 --> 01:59:00.320 align:start position:0%
the term par professional here exists
 
01:59:02.790 --> 01:59:02.800 align:start position:0%
only in so far as it is designed it's
 
01:59:04.750 --> 01:59:04.760 align:start position:0%
defined for this paralal project this
 
01:59:06.870 --> 01:59:06.880 align:start position:0%
par professional pilot
 
01:59:06.880 --> 01:59:08.390 align:start position:0%
par professional pilot
project

01:59:08.390 --> 01:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
project
 
01:59:11.030 --> 01:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
um many of the of the previous Witnesses
 
01:59:12.550 --> 01:59:12.560 align:start position:0%
said what I had planned to so I won't
 
01:59:14.350 --> 01:59:14.360 align:start position:0%
repeat that I suspect I'm also standing
 
01:59:17.510 --> 01:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
between you and lunch um way back when
 
01:59:18.910 --> 01:59:18.920 align:start position:0%
the legislature first started
 
01:59:20.750 --> 01:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
considering this in a study committee in
 
01:59:23.430 --> 01:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
2019 there were very tiny handful of
 
01:59:25.870 --> 01:59:25.880 align:start position:0%
states around the country that were
 
01:59:27.750 --> 01:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
doing anything related to expanding the
 
01:59:30.189 --> 01:59:30.199 align:start position:0%
scope of practice for non- lawyers now
 
01:59:32.270 --> 01:59:32.280 align:start position:0%
there are nine states that have
 
01:59:34.510 --> 01:59:34.520 align:start position:0%
implemented projects there are another
 
01:59:36.149 --> 01:59:36.159 align:start position:0%
half dozen plus who are actively
 
01:59:38.950 --> 01:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
considering it the most recent state to
 
01:59:41.350 --> 01:59:41.360 align:start position:0%
make significant progress toward
 
01:59:42.910 --> 01:59:42.920 align:start position:0%
expanding access to Legal Services
 
01:59:45.750 --> 01:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
through par professionals is Texas um
 
01:59:48.910 --> 01:59:48.920 align:start position:0%
which has a um a recommendation pending
 
01:59:50.790 --> 01:59:50.800 align:start position:0%
before its Supreme Court right now to
 
01:59:53.390 --> 01:59:53.400 align:start position:0%
implement a project and states do this
 
01:59:55.990 --> 01:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
in all different ways uh there's one
 
01:59:57.669 --> 01:59:57.679 align:start position:0%
threshold question though that every
 
01:59:59.550 --> 01:59:59.560 align:start position:0%
state who is thinking about this has to
 
02:00:01.790 --> 02:00:01.800 align:start position:0%
answer in the first instance and that is
 
02:00:03.189 --> 02:00:03.199 align:start position:0%
whether they're going to have a model
 
02:00:05.430 --> 02:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
that requires attorney supervision or a
 
02:00:07.430 --> 02:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
model that doesn't um and New
 
02:00:09.270 --> 02:00:09.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's pilot is very squarely in
 
02:00:11.510 --> 02:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
the category of requiring attorney
 
02:00:13.430 --> 02:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
supervision um which I think has made a
 
02:00:15.390 --> 02:00:15.400 align:start position:0%
lot of sense for New Hampshire it means
 
02:00:17.510 --> 02:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
that there doesn't need to be a separate
 
02:00:19.229 --> 02:00:19.239 align:start position:0%
regulatory structure a separate
 
02:00:20.870 --> 02:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
licensing structure a separate
 
02:00:22.629 --> 02:00:22.639 align:start position:0%
disciplinary structure
 
02:00:25.870 --> 02:00:25.880 align:start position:0%
um requires for example attorneys to
 
02:00:28.109 --> 02:00:28.119 align:start position:0%
make sure that their pa of professionals
 
02:00:29.589 --> 02:00:29.599 align:start position:0%
that they're supervising are covered by
 
02:00:31.910 --> 02:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
their professional liability insurance
 
02:00:33.550 --> 02:00:33.560 align:start position:0%
um so it's just a it's a very smart way
 
02:00:35.550 --> 02:00:35.560 align:start position:0%
of EXA of leveraging the structure that
 
02:00:35.560 --> 02:00:37.030 align:start position:0%
of EXA of leveraging the structure that
already

02:00:37.030 --> 02:00:37.040 align:start position:0%
already
 
02:00:39.589 --> 02:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
exists uh I've worked at nhla for about
 
02:00:42.990 --> 02:00:43.000 align:start position:0%
16 years in total and in those 16 years
 
02:00:45.069 --> 02:00:45.079 align:start position:0%
there has not been a week that has gone
 
02:00:47.629 --> 02:00:47.639 align:start position:0%
by that we have not turned someone away
 
02:00:49.790 --> 02:00:49.800 align:start position:0%
because we don't have enough staff to
 
02:00:53.629 --> 02:00:53.639 align:start position:0%
help them and so for us using the
 
02:00:56.470 --> 02:00:56.480 align:start position:0%
services other of par of professionals
 
02:00:58.350 --> 02:00:58.360 align:start position:0%
other than attorneys has always been
 
02:01:00.390 --> 02:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
part of our law practice because this is
 
02:01:02.189 --> 02:01:02.199 align:start position:0%
something that is is permitted in
 
02:01:03.870 --> 02:01:03.880 align:start position:0%
settings other than the courtroom so
 
02:01:06.229 --> 02:01:06.239 align:start position:0%
just to give you some examples um in
 
02:01:08.430 --> 02:01:08.440 align:start position:0%
administrative law cases so for example
 
02:01:11.750 --> 02:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
when someone um is appealing the denial
 
02:01:14.069 --> 02:01:14.079 align:start position:0%
of a public benefit um you don't have to
 
02:01:15.950 --> 02:01:15.960 align:start position:0%
be represented by a lawyer in those
 
02:01:19.310 --> 02:01:19.320 align:start position:0%
cases there are certain units of federal
 
02:01:21.629 --> 02:01:21.639 align:start position:0%
government which specifically authorize
 
02:01:23.550 --> 02:01:23.560 align:start position:0%
practice practice by non- attorneys so
 
02:01:25.950 --> 02:01:25.960 align:start position:0%
we have on our staff um a
 
02:01:27.709 --> 02:01:27.719 align:start position:0%
paraprofessional who's authorized to
 
02:01:29.270 --> 02:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
practice before the Social Security
 
02:01:30.589 --> 02:01:30.599 align:start position:0%
Administration we have a par
 
02:01:32.109 --> 02:01:32.119 align:start position:0%
professional who's authorized to
 
02:01:34.030 --> 02:01:34.040 align:start position:0%
practice in certain kinds of immigration
 
02:01:37.390 --> 02:01:37.400 align:start position:0%
proceedings um so for for us um having
 
02:01:38.990 --> 02:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
folks who aren't attorneys helping
 
02:01:41.430 --> 02:01:41.440 align:start position:0%
clients and having in place systems to
 
02:01:43.189 --> 02:01:43.199 align:start position:0%
supervise them has been the case for
 
02:01:45.950 --> 02:01:45.960 align:start position:0%
long as long as we've been around um but
 
02:01:47.669 --> 02:01:47.679 align:start position:0%
until this pilot project there has
 
02:01:50.990 --> 02:01:51.000 align:start position:0%
always been this invisible line around
 
02:01:52.430 --> 02:01:52.440 align:start position:0%
the courthouse
 
02:01:55.870 --> 02:01:55.880 align:start position:0%
where a paralal shall not pass and we
 
02:01:58.149 --> 02:01:58.159 align:start position:0%
know from our experience having
 
02:02:00.109 --> 02:02:00.119 align:start position:0%
paraprofessionals handle incredibly
 
02:02:02.629 --> 02:02:02.639 align:start position:0%
complex disability appeals immigration
 
02:02:05.350 --> 02:02:05.360 align:start position:0%
proceedings um that par professionals
 
02:02:07.709 --> 02:02:07.719 align:start position:0%
absolutely have the knowledge and the
 
02:02:11.149 --> 02:02:11.159 align:start position:0%
skills to be able to represent people um
 
02:02:15.149 --> 02:02:15.159 align:start position:0%
with appropriate attorney supervision um
 
02:02:16.709 --> 02:02:16.719 align:start position:0%
hearing the the statistics that you
 
02:02:19.669 --> 02:02:19.679 align:start position:0%
heard today about how many people go to
 
02:02:22.990 --> 02:02:23.000 align:start position:0%
court without lawyers um
 
02:02:25.310 --> 02:02:25.320 align:start position:0%
meant that there was a real opportunity
 
02:02:27.310 --> 02:02:27.320 align:start position:0%
here to solve a problem with something
 
02:02:28.510 --> 02:02:28.520 align:start position:0%
other than more
 
02:02:31.510 --> 02:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
lawyers I feel really strongly that we
 
02:02:33.350 --> 02:02:33.360 align:start position:0%
are not going to solve the access to
 
02:02:35.750 --> 02:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
Justice Gap with just more attorneys um
 
02:02:37.069 --> 02:02:37.079 align:start position:0%
and the courts I think are doing a
 
02:02:39.149 --> 02:02:39.159 align:start position:0%
terrific job in thinking about this from
 
02:02:41.270 --> 02:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
a variety of different perspectives um
 
02:02:43.350 --> 02:02:43.360 align:start position:0%
it's also great to make the court system
 
02:02:45.189 --> 02:02:45.199 align:start position:0%
easier to navigate on your own and
 
02:02:46.550 --> 02:02:46.560 align:start position:0%
that's something that our judicial
 
02:02:49.709 --> 02:02:49.719 align:start position:0%
branch has has taken really seriously um
 
02:02:51.550 --> 02:02:51.560 align:start position:0%
but this pilot project in my experience
 
02:02:54.270 --> 02:02:54.280 align:start position:0%
has been the most significant innovation
 
02:02:55.870 --> 02:02:55.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of solving the problem of
 
02:02:58.589 --> 02:02:58.599 align:start position:0%
access to representation um we have
 
02:03:01.669 --> 02:03:01.679 align:start position:0%
handled 16 cases since the pilot began
 
02:03:03.189 --> 02:03:03.199 align:start position:0%
that we would not have been able to take
 
02:03:05.629 --> 02:03:05.639 align:start position:0%
otherwise we have prioritized paralal
 
02:03:08.669 --> 02:03:08.679 align:start position:0%
hiring over the past two years in order
 
02:03:10.990 --> 02:03:11.000 align:start position:0%
we hope to be able to continue utilizing
 
02:03:13.189 --> 02:03:13.199 align:start position:0%
the services of attorneys other of
 
02:03:14.629 --> 02:03:14.639 align:start position:0%
people other than attorneys to help our
 
02:03:17.350 --> 02:03:17.360 align:start position:0%
clients um so uh really really
 
02:03:19.390 --> 02:03:19.400 align:start position:0%
enthusiastic about it hope that this
 
02:03:21.229 --> 02:03:21.239 align:start position:0%
committee um which has really been part
 
02:03:23.390 --> 02:03:23.400 align:start position:0%
of this since the outset will continue
 
02:03:25.229 --> 02:03:25.239 align:start position:0%
to support it and I'd be very happy to
 
02:03:27.629 --> 02:03:27.639 align:start position:0%
answer any questions thank you questions
 
02:03:31.270 --> 02:03:31.280 align:start position:0%
for this witness representative Manos
 
02:03:33.310 --> 02:03:33.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:03:34.990 --> 02:03:35.000 align:start position:0%
question I was wondering if you could
 
02:03:36.589 --> 02:03:36.599 align:start position:0%
just talk a little bit more about
 
02:03:39.390 --> 02:03:39.400 align:start position:0%
attorney supervision and what exactly
 
02:03:42.950 --> 02:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
that entails and is this a paralal going
 
02:03:46.990 --> 02:03:47.000 align:start position:0%
to court and then making evidentiary
 
02:03:49.950 --> 02:03:49.960 align:start position:0%
objections so it the pilot project does
 
02:03:52.589 --> 02:03:52.599 align:start position:0%
specifically authorize courtroom
 
02:03:55.750 --> 02:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
representation um so that could uh
 
02:03:59.030 --> 02:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely require both um the
 
02:04:01.310 --> 02:04:01.320 align:start position:0%
submission of evidence and the making of
 
02:04:03.629 --> 02:04:03.639 align:start position:0%
of evidentiary objections that is
 
02:04:05.830 --> 02:04:05.840 align:start position:0%
certainly the case um attorney
 
02:04:09.270 --> 02:04:09.280 align:start position:0%
supervision there is in some ways
 
02:04:10.870 --> 02:04:10.880 align:start position:0%
defined by the Court rule I put a copy
 
02:04:13.430 --> 02:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
of the Court rule in your packets um so
 
02:04:14.790 --> 02:04:14.800 align:start position:0%
everyone has that it's Supreme Court
 
02:04:14.800 --> 02:04:15.669 align:start position:0%
everyone has that it's Supreme Court
rule

02:04:15.669 --> 02:04:15.679 align:start position:0%
rule
 
02:04:15.679 --> 02:04:18.310 align:start position:0%
rule
35

02:04:18.310 --> 02:04:18.320 align:start position:0%
35
 
02:04:21.270 --> 02:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
um the attorney the attorney obligation
 
02:04:24.669 --> 02:04:24.679 align:start position:0%
to supervised non-attorneys in one's law
 
02:04:27.430 --> 02:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
practice existed before this pilot
 
02:04:31.310 --> 02:04:31.320 align:start position:0%
project and before rule 35 so if you
 
02:04:33.430 --> 02:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
think for example about real estate
 
02:04:35.310 --> 02:04:35.320 align:start position:0%
transacting um if you've ever been to a
 
02:04:38.510 --> 02:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
real estate closing at a lawyer's office
 
02:04:41.069 --> 02:04:41.079 align:start position:0%
um you very likely even sat with a
 
02:04:43.109 --> 02:04:43.119 align:start position:0%
paralal and it's incredibly likely that
 
02:04:45.390 --> 02:04:45.400 align:start position:0%
a paralal had a significant role in the
 
02:04:46.910 --> 02:04:46.920 align:start position:0%
preparation of the documents for the
 
02:04:48.830 --> 02:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
closing it would not be particularly
 
02:04:51.149 --> 02:04:51.159 align:start position:0%
cost effective um for attorneys to be
 
02:04:53.589 --> 02:04:53.599 align:start position:0%
doing work that can be done um by
 
02:04:54.870 --> 02:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
paralegals and build out at their
 
02:04:58.669 --> 02:04:58.679 align:start position:0%
clients to a lower rate so um law firms
 
02:05:00.709 --> 02:05:00.719 align:start position:0%
have always had to have systems in place
 
02:05:02.790 --> 02:05:02.800 align:start position:0%
in order to supervise the non-attorneys
 
02:05:06.310 --> 02:05:06.320 align:start position:0%
in their office um every Law Firm is
 
02:05:08.030 --> 02:05:08.040 align:start position:0%
going to set up that supervisory system
 
02:05:11.589 --> 02:05:11.599 align:start position:0%
in a slightly different way um we have
 
02:05:13.950 --> 02:05:13.960 align:start position:0%
our systems that we use to supervise not
 
02:05:16.109 --> 02:05:16.119 align:start position:0%
only uh non-attorneys but also to
 
02:05:19.069 --> 02:05:19.079 align:start position:0%
supervise Junior attorneys um who are
 
02:05:22.790 --> 02:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
are very new to law practice um
 
02:05:27.830 --> 02:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
the the the pilot project itself um has
 
02:05:30.229 --> 02:05:30.239 align:start position:0%
very little by way of saying this is how
 
02:05:34.709 --> 02:05:34.719 align:start position:0%
you must supervise um and really um
 
02:05:37.149 --> 02:05:37.159 align:start position:0%
requires the attorney to make
 
02:05:39.030 --> 02:05:39.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate judgment calls about what a
 
02:05:40.990 --> 02:05:41.000 align:start position:0%
particular par illegal is going to need
 
02:05:42.990 --> 02:05:43.000 align:start position:0%
so just to give you an example on the
 
02:05:44.870 --> 02:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
first day that an attorney Works in our
 
02:05:46.390 --> 02:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
office we're not going to send that
 
02:05:48.589 --> 02:05:48.599 align:start position:0%
attorney to court by themselves um much
 
02:05:51.669 --> 02:05:51.679 align:start position:0%
less a paralal um but there are
 
02:05:53.149 --> 02:05:53.159 align:start position:0%
experienced paralegals who are very
 
02:05:54.669 --> 02:05:54.679 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable in a particular practice
 
02:05:56.709 --> 02:05:56.719 align:start position:0%
area and have observed many many
 
02:05:58.750 --> 02:05:58.760 align:start position:0%
hearings sitting next to an attorney who
 
02:06:00.709 --> 02:06:00.719 align:start position:0%
for whom it may be appropriate um in
 
02:06:04.950 --> 02:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
certain cases for them to um to appear
 
02:06:07.669 --> 02:06:07.679 align:start position:0%
on their own so it um again it it's
 
02:06:09.669 --> 02:06:09.679 align:start position:0%
utilizing the existing system of
 
02:06:11.430 --> 02:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
supervision that was already required by
 
02:06:12.709 --> 02:06:12.719 align:start position:0%
our ethical
 
02:06:15.950 --> 02:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
rules other questions for this witness
 
02:06:18.109 --> 02:06:18.119 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
02:06:21.589 --> 02:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
you um is there anyone else who uh
 
02:06:26.629 --> 02:06:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:29.189 --> 02:06:29.199 align:start position:0%
361 seeing none I'm going to close the
 
02:06:31.149 --> 02:06:31.159 align:start position:0%
hearing on Senate Bill
 
02:06:36.390 --> 02:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
361 um and um I just briefly uh
 
02:06:39.030 --> 02:06:39.040 align:start position:0%
discussed this with uh representative
 
02:06:43.030 --> 02:06:43.040 align:start position:0%
Smith um my inclination is that this is
 
02:06:45.310 --> 02:06:45.320 align:start position:0%
something we could just exec now is
 
02:06:47.589 --> 02:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
anybody uh anybody have any problem with
 
02:06:49.589 --> 02:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
doing I believe representative Smith
 
02:06:52.390 --> 02:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
agrees but I'm I I should ask her for
 
02:06:55.430 --> 02:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
sure yes Mr chair I agree anybody have
 
02:06:58.549 --> 02:06:58.559 align:start position:0%
any problem if we exec this bill
 
02:07:03.750 --> 02:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
now all right so um then um do I have a
 
02:07:07.870 --> 02:07:07.880 align:start position:0%
motion uh I'll move all right so moved
 
02:07:10.229 --> 02:07:10.239 align:start position:0%
by representative Smith seconded by
 
02:07:14.470 --> 02:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
representative katab um any any further
 
02:07:16.790 --> 02:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
discussion I I mean I just speaking
 
02:07:18.350 --> 02:07:18.360 align:start position:0%
personally I think based on what Justice
 
02:07:19.709 --> 02:07:19.719 align:start position:0%
Basset said and Justice Gordon and
 
02:07:21.229 --> 02:07:21.239 align:start position:0%
really all the witnesses I mean it seems
 
02:07:25.030 --> 02:07:25.040 align:start position:0%
like this is absolutely worth doing and
 
02:07:28.709 --> 02:07:28.719 align:start position:0%
uh um I think that the the practice of
 
02:07:30.510 --> 02:07:30.520 align:start position:0%
law is moving in the direction that they
 
02:07:32.430 --> 02:07:32.440 align:start position:0%
indicated and I think that's that's a
 
02:07:32.440 --> 02:07:33.510 align:start position:0%
indicated and I think that's that's a
good

02:07:33.510 --> 02:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
good
 
02:07:36.270 --> 02:07:36.280 align:start position:0%
thing any yes representative Wallace
 
02:07:38.910 --> 02:07:38.920 align:start position:0%
thank you cherland uh well we have a
 
02:07:40.430 --> 02:07:40.440 align:start position:0%
couple of nurses on the committee and I
 
02:07:43.229 --> 02:07:43.239 align:start position:0%
think in their Community uh the medical
 
02:07:45.549 --> 02:07:45.559 align:start position:0%
uh world the nurses do the bulk of the
 
02:07:46.709 --> 02:07:46.719 align:start position:0%
work and I would argue that the
 
02:07:48.990 --> 02:07:49.000 align:start position:0%
paralegals do the bulk of the work in in
 
02:07:51.990 --> 02:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
the judicial world so uh to will be
 
02:07:55.310 --> 02:07:55.320 align:start position:0%
supporting this any other yes uh
 
02:07:57.669 --> 02:07:57.679 align:start position:0%
representative Lono I just wanted to say
 
02:07:59.669 --> 02:07:59.679 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for letting me make a
 
02:08:02.629 --> 02:08:02.639 align:start position:0%
comment um as a nurse I think uh it's
 
02:08:05.990 --> 02:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
really good to see that there'd be more
 
02:08:08.910 --> 02:08:08.920 align:start position:0%
representation um to help with the court
 
02:08:12.109 --> 02:08:12.119 align:start position:0%
systems um but I think um just wondering
 
02:08:15.350 --> 02:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
too the liability I've I didn't I didn't
 
02:08:17.350 --> 02:08:17.360 align:start position:0%
quite hear that about the liability in
 
02:08:21.549 --> 02:08:21.559 align:start position:0%
regards to um who is do they have their
 
02:08:24.390 --> 02:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
own uh liability or does that uh the
 
02:08:26.950 --> 02:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
paay professional fall under the lawyer
 
02:08:29.069 --> 02:08:29.079 align:start position:0%
I can I think I can answer that unless
 
02:08:30.990 --> 02:08:31.000 align:start position:0%
you'd rather have if we're in executive
 
02:08:33.510 --> 02:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
session right oh right but if sure now
 
02:08:34.950 --> 02:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
if you have the answer that's fine and
 
02:08:37.030 --> 02:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
if I assume if somebody in the audience
 
02:08:38.990 --> 02:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
disagrees with you they'll let us know
 
02:08:42.669 --> 02:08:42.679 align:start position:0%
oh I know that um uh it is my
 
02:08:45.310 --> 02:08:45.320 align:start position:0%
understanding Mr chair that as part of
 
02:08:49.870 --> 02:08:49.880 align:start position:0%
this project the um I'll use the word
 
02:08:52.350 --> 02:08:52.360 align:start position:0%
sponsor you know whether
 
02:08:56.990 --> 02:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
it's uh legal aid or whatever has the
 
02:08:59.589 --> 02:08:59.599 align:start position:0%
responsibility to
 
02:09:06.950 --> 02:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:09.430 --> 02:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
coverage I've been on this issue for a
 
02:09:13.149 --> 02:09:13.159 align:start position:0%
long time Mr chair seeing no no
 
02:09:16.510 --> 02:09:16.520 align:start position:0%
objection from the audience I I accept
 
02:09:19.629 --> 02:09:19.639 align:start position:0%
that what you say is true um all right
 
02:09:20.830 --> 02:09:20.840 align:start position:0%
well thank you for that vote of
 
02:09:20.840 --> 02:09:21.990 align:start position:0%
well thank you for that vote of
confidence

02:09:21.990 --> 02:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
confidence
 
02:09:24.910 --> 02:09:24.920 align:start position:0%
any uh yes representative Manos and then
 
02:09:26.950 --> 02:09:26.960 align:start position:0%
representative Oregon I I had one
 
02:09:29.390 --> 02:09:29.400 align:start position:0%
question that I that I neglected to ask
 
02:09:32.990 --> 02:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
but maybe maybe you know um when a
 
02:09:35.750 --> 02:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
paralal participates in a case and an
 
02:09:37.750 --> 02:09:37.760 align:start position:0%
appearance is filed do they file their
 
02:09:40.510 --> 02:09:40.520 align:start position:0%
own appearance and does the court then
 
02:09:43.189 --> 02:09:43.199 align:start position:0%
know that representation is being
 
02:09:46.510 --> 02:09:46.520 align:start position:0%
provided by a paralal as opposed to an
 
02:09:49.629 --> 02:09:49.639 align:start position:0%
attorney or is it the appearance of the
 
02:09:52.549 --> 02:09:52.559 align:start position:0%
attorney that is technically on record
 
02:09:54.790 --> 02:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
if if I remember correctly and again I
 
02:09:59.229 --> 02:09:59.239 align:start position:0%
please correct me if I'm wrong um the uh
 
02:10:00.270 --> 02:10:00.280 align:start position:0%
the par
 
02:10:04.910 --> 02:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
professional whatever the title is um
 
02:10:08.910 --> 02:10:08.920 align:start position:0%
enters his or her appearance and is
 
02:10:11.030 --> 02:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
noted for what that person's
 
02:10:11.040 --> 02:10:12.549 align:start position:0%
noted for what that person's
qualifications

02:10:12.549 --> 02:10:12.559 align:start position:0%
qualifications
 
02:10:15.430 --> 02:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
are representative Oregon I was just
 
02:10:17.750 --> 02:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
going to comment this bill takes effect
 
02:10:21.390 --> 02:10:21.400 align:start position:0%
on passage I.E when we send it around
 
02:10:23.069 --> 02:10:23.079 align:start position:0%
and it gets over to the governor's desk
 
02:10:27.350 --> 02:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
so the sooner this process uh is
 
02:10:29.950 --> 02:10:29.960 align:start position:0%
completed assuming the Full House agrees
 
02:10:32.149 --> 02:10:32.159 align:start position:0%
with us this is a good bill the sooner
 
02:10:33.310 --> 02:10:33.320 align:start position:0%
goes to the Secretary State and the
 
02:10:34.910 --> 02:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
governor then the sooner it gets passed
 
02:10:37.589 --> 02:10:37.599 align:start position:0%
and the sooner um New Hampshire legal
 
02:10:39.310 --> 02:10:39.320 align:start position:0%
assistance and the other entities are
 
02:10:41.270 --> 02:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
making use of it can begin uh planning
 
02:10:44.030 --> 02:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
their their cases because uh it makes a
 
02:10:46.510 --> 02:10:46.520 align:start position:0%
difference if this is going to end
 
02:10:48.669 --> 02:10:48.679 align:start position:0%
January 1st 2025 or where they have
 
02:10:50.830 --> 02:10:50.840 align:start position:0%
another four years to uh to take
 
02:10:52.470 --> 02:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
advantage of this and maybe even
 
02:10:54.310 --> 02:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
permanently so I think you know the
 
02:10:55.589 --> 02:10:55.599 align:start position:0%
sooner we can get this through the
 
02:10:57.390 --> 02:10:57.400 align:start position:0%
process uh the better for everyone
 
02:11:00.069 --> 02:11:00.079 align:start position:0%
involved thanks any other comments from
 
02:11:01.709 --> 02:11:01.719 align:start position:0%
yes representative D Lorenzo uh thank
 
02:11:04.189 --> 02:11:04.199 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and um I do want to say
 
02:11:07.870 --> 02:11:07.880 align:start position:0%
that I studied to be a paralal um back
 
02:11:11.189 --> 02:11:11.199 align:start position:0%
in the 80s I went to the University of
 
02:11:14.350 --> 02:11:14.360 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts in uh Boston and we had a
 
02:11:16.750 --> 02:11:16.760 align:start position:0%
program it was called um legal studies
 
02:11:19.589 --> 02:11:19.599 align:start position:0%
major and we were preparing to be become
 
02:11:22.629 --> 02:11:22.639 align:start position:0%
paralegals so after graduated from uh
 
02:11:26.229 --> 02:11:26.239 align:start position:0%
UMass I went on to Boston University and
 
02:11:28.750 --> 02:11:28.760 align:start position:0%
I completed their program um it was
 
02:11:31.030 --> 02:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
called Boston University program for
 
02:11:33.390 --> 02:11:33.400 align:start position:0%
Legal Assistant so sometimes the terms
 
02:11:36.030 --> 02:11:36.040 align:start position:0%
are use interchangeably I ended up in
 
02:11:38.270 --> 02:11:38.280 align:start position:0%
housing though rather than being a
 
02:11:40.709 --> 02:11:40.719 align:start position:0%
paralal but I found that in my housing
 
02:11:42.189 --> 02:11:42.199 align:start position:0%
work I got there was plenty of
 
02:11:43.990 --> 02:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to work on a lot of things
 
02:11:45.790 --> 02:11:45.800 align:start position:0%
but I think it's a great program and I'm
 
02:11:48.430 --> 02:11:48.440 align:start position:0%
really excited about it thank you all
 
02:11:51.669 --> 02:11:51.679 align:start position:0%

almost 20 years ago and uh what we were
 
03:09:00.030 --> 03:09:00.040 align:start position:0%
trying to do was develop the best trust
 
03:09:01.750 --> 03:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
laws in the United
 
03:09:05.590 --> 03:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
States and we were in competition with
 
03:09:08.429 --> 03:09:08.439 align:start position:0%
Dakota and Delaware not Dakota or
 
03:09:11.190 --> 03:09:11.200 align:start position:0%
Delaware so what we did is we we brought
 
03:09:14.150 --> 03:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
forth a series of changes to trust to
 
03:09:18.349 --> 03:09:18.359 align:start position:0%
trust law and in this particular bill is
 
03:09:22.309 --> 03:09:22.319 align:start position:0%

03:09:29.349 --> 03:09:29.359 align:start position:0%
concerned Yona uh and the uh the
 
03:09:32.070 --> 03:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
movement is the placement uh the
 
03:09:35.150 --> 03:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
placement of of of certain U uh certain
 
03:09:38.429 --> 03:09:38.439 align:start position:0%

clear and user friendly as
 
03:10:10.269 --> 03:10:10.279 align:start position:0%
possible um it was adopted by the Senate
 
03:10:13.070 --> 03:10:13.080 align:start position:0%
with minor uh amendments and we had a
 
03:10:15.510 --> 03:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
series of bills that have come in over a
 
03:10:18.469 --> 03:10:18.479 align:start position:0%
period of time there are three major
 
03:10:21.229 --> 03:10:21.239 align:start position:0%
components of this bill and as I said Mr

another the the original amendment that
 
03:10:36.469 --> 03:10:36.479 align:start position:0%
we made in in the house just corrected a
 
03:10:39.590 --> 03:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
statutory reference from from B to from
 
03:10:42.190 --> 03:10:42.200 align:start position:0%
A to B in terms of the statute uh he'll
 
03:10:45.830 --> 03:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
go into more detail of what's in in this
 
03:10:48.590 --> 03:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
bill uh this bill cleans up and
 
03:10:50.389 --> 03:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
simplifies the trust statutes by
 
03:10:52.950 --> 03:10:52.960 align:start position:0%
correcting errors and moving relevant
 
03:10:57.790 --> 03:10:57.800 align:start position:0%
portions of RSA 564a into RSA
 
03:11:00.710 --> 03:11:00.720 align:start position:0%
564b the New Hampshire trust code and
 
03:11:03.990 --> 03:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
repealing the remainder of rsas
 
03:11:08.269 --> 03:11:08.279 align:start position:0%
564a period RSA 564a has served as New
 
03:11:10.550 --> 03:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's original trust code but over
 
03:11:12.110 --> 03:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
the years following the adoption of The
 
03:11:14.349 --> 03:11:14.359 align:start position:0%
Bard New Hampshire trust code most of
 
03:11:17.349 --> 03:11:17.359 align:start position:0%
the except exceptions have been repealed
 
03:11:19.750 --> 03:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
leaving only a few stray Provisions
 
03:11:21.670 --> 03:11:21.680 align:start position:0%
further consolidating the state's trust
 
03:11:23.990 --> 03:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
laws into the Noy trust code will make
 
03:11:26.550 --> 03:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
these laws clearer and more
 
03:11:28.750 --> 03:11:28.760 align:start position:0%
understandable and more user friendly
 
03:11:31.590 --> 03:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
and uh Mr plar will give you a a
 
03:11:34.990 --> 03:11:35.000 align:start position:0%
thorough analysis of that and as I said
 
03:11:37.670 --> 03:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
over the years we have become extremely
 
03:11:41.110 --> 03:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
competitive for non-depository trusts we
 
03:11:43.750 --> 03:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
we they've located in the State uh it's
 
03:11:45.950 --> 03:11:45.960 align:start position:0%

Portsmouth um a number of people working
 
03:11:58.750 --> 03:11:58.760 align:start position:0%
out of out of that office and they they
 
03:12:02.190 --> 03:12:02.200 align:start position:0%
are integral part of the trust uh trust
 
03:12:03.990 --> 03:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
business here in the state of New New
 
03:12:07.190 --> 03:12:07.200 align:start position:0%

03:12:16.990 --> 03:12:17.000 align:start position:0%
in the trust business in New Hampshire
 
03:12:19.269 --> 03:12:19.279 align:start position:0%

revisions okay trying to make a good
thing

03:13:34.630 --> 03:13:34.640 align:start position:0%
thing
 
03:13:37.349 --> 03:13:37.359 align:start position:0%
better no no that's fine sure that's
 
03:13:41.269 --> 03:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:46.030 --> 03:13:46.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:46.040 --> 03:13:47.670 align:start position:0%
 
proposal

03:13:47.670 --> 03:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
03:13:47.680 --> 03:13:52.150 align:start position:0%
proposal
two

03:13:52.150 --> 03:13:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:01.590 --> 03:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:03.670 --> 03:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
great all right so you know what can I
 
03:14:05.830 --> 03:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
just U Mr Pearl can I just ask you the
 
03:14:08.670 --> 03:14:08.680 align:start position:0%
the um the proposed amendments that you
 
03:14:11.510 --> 03:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
just gave me so I see that though you
 
03:14:14.030 --> 03:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
the way you've done it is um amend the
 
03:14:17.630 --> 03:14:17.640 align:start position:0%
bill by replacing all so this if we give
 
03:14:20.950 --> 03:14:20.960 align:start position:0%
this to OS and say just you know make
 
03:14:24.030 --> 03:14:24.040 align:start position:0%
this do do this and put it in final form
 
03:14:27.150 --> 03:14:27.160 align:start position:0%
that will that will be the whole
 
03:14:30.429 --> 03:14:30.439 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh we you won't you won't have
 
03:14:32.790 --> 03:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
to refer back to the original Bill no
 
03:14:34.790 --> 03:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
okay all right great hopefully that is a
 
03:14:36.590 --> 03:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
helpful way yeah no no it's a very
 
03:14:37.830 --> 03:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
helpful way to do uh because there were
 
03:14:39.670 --> 03:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
changes in a few places though not you
 
03:14:41.550 --> 03:14:41.560 align:start position:0%
know very significant yeah no that's a
 
03:14:43.990 --> 03:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
very that's a very helpful way to do
 
03:14:47.349 --> 03:14:47.359 align:start position:0%
it so uh I'll introduce myself uh my
 
03:14:50.830 --> 03:14:50.840 align:start position:0%
name is Glenn PLO uh as Senator Del Sor
 
03:14:52.590 --> 03:14:52.600 align:start position:0%
kindly said I've been working in this
 
03:14:54.750 --> 03:14:54.760 align:start position:0%
space for a very long time I'm General
 
03:14:57.710 --> 03:14:57.720 align:start position:0%
council at Jordan Park Trust Company in
 
03:14:59.830 --> 03:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth um and I'm also president of
 
03:15:01.469 --> 03:15:01.479 align:start position:0%
the trust Council and for those of you
 
03:15:03.750 --> 03:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
who don't uh know the work of the trust
 
03:15:06.190 --> 03:15:06.200 align:start position:0%
Council uh building on what uh the
 
03:15:10.309 --> 03:15:10.319 align:start position:0%
senator said um no State can continue
 
03:15:12.790 --> 03:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
successfully sort of competing in this
 
03:15:15.870 --> 03:15:15.880 align:start position:0%
uh Arena without continuously ensuring
 
03:15:18.229 --> 03:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
that uh if better Mouse trrap shows up
 
03:15:20.349 --> 03:15:20.359 align:start position:0%
somewhere else or if just someone comes
 
03:15:23.150 --> 03:15:23.160 align:start position:0%
along with a better idea that we care
 
03:15:26.429 --> 03:15:26.439 align:start position:0%
and feed this modernization uh because
 
03:15:28.670 --> 03:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
it's not a static sort of an industry
 
03:15:31.150 --> 03:15:31.160 align:start position:0%
and so uh with tremendous support from
 
03:15:34.550 --> 03:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
the legislature for nearly 20 years uh
 
03:15:36.349 --> 03:15:36.359 align:start position:0%
we we've done that and we've we we've
 
03:15:40.710 --> 03:15:40.720 align:start position:0%
tried to improve where we can um and uh
 
03:15:42.550 --> 03:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
and we appreciate all that support we
 
03:15:44.790 --> 03:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
have a legislative committee with a a
 
03:15:46.189 --> 03:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
number of experienced trust
 
03:15:46.199 --> 03:15:47.550 align:start position:0%
number of experienced trust
practitioners

03:15:47.550 --> 03:15:47.560 align:start position:0%
practitioners
 
03:15:49.870 --> 03:15:49.880 align:start position:0%
um whenever we have some notion about
 
03:15:52.070 --> 03:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
legislation we go to uh all the
 
03:15:53.590 --> 03:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
stakeholders we think would have any
 
03:15:56.349 --> 03:15:56.359 align:start position:0%
interest in it so all of this has been
 
03:15:59.189 --> 03:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
uh reviewed by the banking Department
 
03:16:01.990 --> 03:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
the bankers Association uh the director
 
03:16:03.790 --> 03:16:03.800 align:start position:0%
of charitable trust which whom we've had
 
03:16:06.990 --> 03:16:07.000 align:start position:0%
some dialogue I don't uh speak to their
 
03:16:09.750 --> 03:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
positions on the bill but we have um
 
03:16:12.030 --> 03:16:12.040 align:start position:0%
shared it out and had dialogue uh back
 
03:16:16.710 --> 03:16:16.720 align:start position:0%
and forth uh with that Patrick is uh is
 
03:16:16.720 --> 03:16:17.550 align:start position:0%
and forth uh with that Patrick is uh is
uh

03:16:17.550 --> 03:16:17.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:16:20.150 --> 03:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
Patrick Collins is a director at mlan
 
03:16:21.750 --> 03:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
Middleton in the trust and States
 
03:16:24.229 --> 03:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
Department he chairs uh the council's
 
03:16:26.790 --> 03:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
legislative committee uh he's the best
 
03:16:29.510 --> 03:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
trust practitioner I've ever met and my
 
03:16:33.229 --> 03:16:33.239 align:start position:0%
friend uh and uh he'll go over and you
 
03:16:35.550 --> 03:16:35.560 align:start position:0%
know we're prepared at whatever 100,000
 
03:16:38.990 --> 03:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
feet 25,000 fet any questions Patrick

will be able to uh walk you through so
 
03:16:42.550 --> 03:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
he'll start with a kind of a high level
 
03:16:44.510 --> 03:16:44.520 align:start position:0%
walk through and uh we'll take it from
 
03:16:46.550 --> 03:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
there that no that'd be great if you yes
 
03:16:48.670 --> 03:16:48.680 align:start position:0%
uh welcome and if you could just uh
 
03:16:50.389 --> 03:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
maybe just kind of give us give the
 
03:16:53.670 --> 03:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
committee sort of just an overview of
 
03:16:55.830 --> 03:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
what is a unit trust and you know that
 
03:16:58.150 --> 03:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing perfect we'll do uh
 
03:17:00.710 --> 03:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
thanks for having me here the uh big
 
03:17:03.030 --> 03:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
picture overview of what we're trying to
 
03:17:06.110 --> 03:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
achieve is three things um and I'll just
 
03:17:08.750 --> 03:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
classify them kind of uh casually as
 
03:17:10.510 --> 03:17:10.520 align:start position:0%
we're trying to clean up we're trying to
 
03:17:12.590 --> 03:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
clarify and we're trying to optimize and
 
03:17:13.750 --> 03:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
then there are three buckets into which
 
03:17:18.189 --> 03:17:18.199 align:start position:0%
those fall so the first is uh we have uh
 
03:17:20.990 --> 03:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
as part of the New Hampshire trust code
 
03:17:22.990 --> 03:17:23.000 align:start position:0%
uh the statutory uh language there is
 
03:17:25.110 --> 03:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
under 564b and that was part of the
 
03:17:27.510 --> 03:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
modernization that Senator delandre was
 
03:17:29.870 --> 03:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
was mentioning uh and so when any of a
 
03:17:32.189 --> 03:17:32.199 align:start position:0%
time a practitioner is looking to see
 
03:17:34.349 --> 03:17:34.359 align:start position:0%
what is allowed what does the statute
 
03:17:35.790 --> 03:17:35.800 align:start position:0%
provide for they go to
 
03:17:40.550 --> 03:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
564b historically the uh trust laws
 
03:17:42.269 --> 03:17:42.279 align:start position:0%
prior to the enactment of the New
 
03:17:43.510 --> 03:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire trust code were kind of
 
03:17:45.510 --> 03:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
scattered throughout the various other
 
03:17:48.590 --> 03:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
statutes uh and one place where uh some
 
03:17:50.910 --> 03:17:50.920 align:start position:0%
old language still exists in
 
03:17:53.269 --> 03:17:53.279 align:start position:0%
564a and so one of the cleanups that
 
03:17:54.790 --> 03:17:54.800 align:start position:0%
we're doing is taking the language
 
03:17:58.429 --> 03:17:58.439 align:start position:0%
that's in 564a and moving it into 564b
 
03:17:59.830 --> 03:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
just so that practitioners when they're
 
03:18:02.189 --> 03:18:02.199 align:start position:0%
looking to see anything related to trust
 
03:18:05.189 --> 03:18:05.199 align:start position:0%
there's one place to go and that's 564b
 
03:18:07.510 --> 03:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
and not hanging out there other
 
03:18:09.550 --> 03:18:09.560 align:start position:0%
statutory Provisions that are directly
 
03:18:11.670 --> 03:18:11.680 align:start position:0%
related so that's not a very substantive
 
03:18:13.630 --> 03:18:13.640 align:start position:0%
change it's really just a migration
 
03:18:17.710 --> 03:18:17.720 align:start position:0%
that's the cleanup um for um
 
03:18:21.790 --> 03:18:21.800 align:start position:0%
optimization uh we have in our statute
 
03:18:26.229 --> 03:18:26.239 align:start position:0%
um the ability to convert uh a trust uh
 
03:18:27.710 --> 03:18:27.720 align:start position:0%
to a unit trust which I'm going to
 
03:18:30.189 --> 03:18:30.199 align:start position:0%
describe in a second what we don't have
 
03:18:32.550 --> 03:18:32.560 align:start position:0%
is the ability at Inception of a trust
 
03:18:35.309 --> 03:18:35.319 align:start position:0%
creation to create a unit trust and so
 
03:18:37.070 --> 03:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
when we were thinking about well we have
 
03:18:38.510 --> 03:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
we have the ability to convert to it why
 
03:18:39.950 --> 03:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
don't we just have the ability to do it
 
03:18:42.189 --> 03:18:42.199 align:start position:0%
from the beginning uh and I'll explain
 
03:18:45.030 --> 03:18:45.040 align:start position:0%
what that what that means um in a second
 
03:18:47.750 --> 03:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh and then thirdly we have uh a
 
03:18:50.110 --> 03:18:50.120 align:start position:0%
clarification uh Amendment to the trust
 
03:18:53.750 --> 03:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
code which is uh specifically around the
 
03:18:55.389 --> 03:18:55.399 align:start position:0%
liability and the responsibility and the
 
03:18:58.269 --> 03:18:58.279 align:start position:0%
duties of Trustees uh to redress
 
03:19:00.429 --> 03:19:00.439 align:start position:0%
breaches of trust that are known uh and
 
03:19:01.830 --> 03:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll get into that in more detail
 
03:19:04.189 --> 03:19:04.199 align:start position:0%
so those are the two substantive changes
 
03:19:05.990 --> 03:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
the first on the
 
03:19:09.990 --> 03:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
unitrust um a uh to to describe what a
 
03:19:11.790 --> 03:19:11.800 align:start position:0%
unitrust is I'm going to describe what
 
03:19:13.910 --> 03:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
uh traditional trust law looks like in
 
03:19:17.269 --> 03:19:17.279 align:start position:0%
terms of distribution requirements um
 
03:19:19.630 --> 03:19:19.640 align:start position:0%
generally speaking traditionally uh
 
03:19:21.269 --> 03:19:21.279 align:start position:0%
trusts usually would
 
03:19:23.510 --> 03:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
bifurcate uh interests that a
 
03:19:25.469 --> 03:19:25.479 align:start position:0%
beneficiary could have into an income
 
03:19:27.870 --> 03:19:27.880 align:start position:0%
interest and a principal interest and so
 
03:19:30.309 --> 03:19:30.319 align:start position:0%
if you have Assets in a trust uh they
 
03:19:32.389 --> 03:19:32.399 align:start position:0%
typically hopefully will generate income
 
03:19:34.349 --> 03:19:34.359 align:start position:0%
so that would be that would be dividends
 
03:19:37.469 --> 03:19:37.479 align:start position:0%
on stocks interest on bank accounts uh
 
03:19:39.950 --> 03:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
rental income if you has real estate
 
03:19:42.590 --> 03:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
that income interest traditionally uh
 
03:19:44.150 --> 03:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
could be assigned to a specific
 
03:19:46.830 --> 03:19:46.840 align:start position:0%
beneficiary so for example you might say
 
03:19:49.630 --> 03:19:49.640 align:start position:0%
on my death when I pass away I leave x
 
03:19:52.030 --> 03:19:52.040 align:start position:0%
amount of money in trust for my wife and
 
03:19:54.269 --> 03:19:54.279 align:start position:0%
my wife can get all of the income from
 
03:19:56.150 --> 03:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
the trust and that would be all that
 
03:19:58.790 --> 03:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
income that the trust generates after my
 
03:20:01.349 --> 03:20:01.359 align:start position:0%
wife dies what's left all the principle
 
03:20:02.830 --> 03:20:02.840 align:start position:0%
which is the Corpus of the Trust might
 
03:20:04.550 --> 03:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
go to my kids that would be a kind of a
 
03:20:07.830 --> 03:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
standard uh example of a of a trust term
 
03:20:09.469 --> 03:20:09.479 align:start position:0%
what ended up happening by virtue of
 
03:20:11.630 --> 03:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
that traditional structure is that
 
03:20:14.030 --> 03:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
Investments uh ended up being tailored
 
03:20:16.030 --> 03:20:16.040 align:start position:0%
more towards generating income because
 
03:20:17.150 --> 03:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
that was the def
 
03:20:19.269 --> 03:20:19.279 align:start position:0%
benefit that the that the beneficiary
 
03:20:21.269 --> 03:20:21.279 align:start position:0%
the income beneficiary had and so the
 
03:20:22.790 --> 03:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
Investment Portfolio would look
 
03:20:26.150 --> 03:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
something like investments in non-growth
 
03:20:28.389 --> 03:20:28.399 align:start position:0%
stocks that generated income whether
 
03:20:30.389 --> 03:20:30.399 align:start position:0%
that's uh you know like a utility
 
03:20:33.309 --> 03:20:33.319 align:start position:0%
company or Verizon that kicks off a
 
03:20:34.469 --> 03:20:34.479 align:start position:0%
pretty healthy dividend so that the
 
03:20:36.030 --> 03:20:36.040 align:start position:0%
income beneficiary had a sufficient
 
03:20:37.510 --> 03:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
amount of cash flow that they could
 
03:20:39.630 --> 03:20:39.640 align:start position:0%
receive by virtue of doing that that
 
03:20:41.590 --> 03:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
hurt to some extent the remainder
 
03:20:43.349 --> 03:20:43.359 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries which would be the kids in
 
03:20:47.070 --> 03:20:47.080 align:start position:0%
that example uh because they are subject
 
03:20:49.710 --> 03:20:49.720 align:start position:0%
to a an Investment Portfolio that's not
 
03:20:51.950 --> 03:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
really built to grow but just to
 
03:20:56.469 --> 03:20:56.479 align:start position:0%
generate income and so uh not us uh but
 
03:20:58.630 --> 03:20:58.640 align:start position:0%
in the general realm of trust and
 
03:21:01.670 --> 03:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
Estates planning uh the idea of a unit
 
03:21:04.229 --> 03:21:04.239 align:start position:0%
trust was born which was to say instead
 
03:21:07.950 --> 03:21:07.960 align:start position:0%
of focusing on income which then derives
 
03:21:10.469 --> 03:21:10.479 align:start position:0%
you know a specific Investment Portfolio
 
03:21:12.710 --> 03:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
can we instead give that income
 
03:21:15.110 --> 03:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
beneficiary a right to a percentage of
 
03:21:18.189 --> 03:21:18.199 align:start position:0%
the trust and thereby allow the trust
 
03:21:20.670 --> 03:21:20.680 align:start position:0%
Investments to be uh tailored more
 
03:21:23.110 --> 03:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
towards growth and so if you had
 
03:21:25.790 --> 03:21:25.800 align:start position:0%
somebody over the last 10 or 15 years uh
 
03:21:28.389 --> 03:21:28.399 align:start position:0%
that was invested in more growth stocks
 
03:21:31.950 --> 03:21:31.960 align:start position:0%
like Apple and Google and Nidia you know
 
03:21:34.309 --> 03:21:34.319 align:start position:0%
you would see a much better return than
 
03:21:36.990 --> 03:21:37.000 align:start position:0%
if you were invested in income uh
 
03:21:40.110 --> 03:21:40.120 align:start position:0%
producing stocks and by virtue of that
 
03:21:43.990 --> 03:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh the unit trust statutes were born uh
 
03:21:45.510 --> 03:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
and in New Hampshire what we currently
 
03:21:47.189 --> 03:21:47.199 align:start position:0%
have is the ability to take one of those
 
03:21:49.429 --> 03:21:49.439 align:start position:0%
traditional trusts that was income based
 
03:21:51.469 --> 03:21:51.479 align:start position:0%
and convert it to a unit trust which
 
03:21:53.349 --> 03:21:53.359 align:start position:0%
would allow the the spouse in that
 
03:21:55.070 --> 03:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
example to instead of receiving income
 
03:21:58.030 --> 03:21:58.040 align:start position:0%
receive between three and 5% of the
 
03:22:01.710 --> 03:22:01.720 align:start position:0%
trust Corpus each year valued at as of
 
03:22:03.990 --> 03:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh December 31st of the prior year and
 
03:22:06.750 --> 03:22:06.760 align:start position:0%
so by virtue that the the the the
 
03:22:09.229 --> 03:22:09.239 align:start position:0%
profile of the assets increases this the
 
03:22:10.550 --> 03:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
income beneficiary actually ends up
 
03:22:12.150 --> 03:22:12.160 align:start position:0%
getting more and the remainder
 
03:22:14.349 --> 03:22:14.359 align:start position:0%
beneficiary gets more assuming that the
 
03:22:16.229 --> 03:22:16.239 align:start position:0%
uh assuming that the the assets in the
 
03:22:19.910 --> 03:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
trust grow uh which which they should um
 
03:22:22.389 --> 03:22:22.399 align:start position:0%
and so we have that already baked into
 
03:22:24.229 --> 03:22:24.239 align:start position:0%
our statute that's already there what
 
03:22:26.349 --> 03:22:26.359 align:start position:0%
we're asking for with this amendment is
 
03:22:30.150 --> 03:22:30.160 align:start position:0%
to authorize a uh trust at Inception to
 
03:22:32.590 --> 03:22:32.600 align:start position:0%
be structured as a unit trust whereby
 
03:22:35.110 --> 03:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
the uh one individual would be the
 
03:22:38.309 --> 03:22:38.319 align:start position:0%
recipient of a percentage of the trust
 
03:22:40.309 --> 03:22:40.319 align:start position:0%
uh which we're gauging between three and
 
03:22:43.790 --> 03:22:43.800 align:start position:0%
5% um as opposed to just being defined
 
03:22:47.750 --> 03:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
by income um it's it's a provision that
 
03:22:51.630 --> 03:22:51.640 align:start position:0%
is in uh Delaware statute uh we just
 
03:22:54.229 --> 03:22:54.239 align:start position:0%
don't have it here it's not a uh we
 
03:22:56.269 --> 03:22:56.279 align:start position:0%
don't think at least a a major
 
03:22:57.950 --> 03:22:57.960 align:start position:0%
substantive change it's just an
 
03:23:00.429 --> 03:23:00.439 align:start position:0%
optionality uh that we don't currently
 
03:23:03.590 --> 03:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
have uh to start at Inception um in a
 
03:23:05.830 --> 03:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
unit trust structure and we think it's
 
03:23:08.229 --> 03:23:08.239 align:start position:0%
uh beneficial to all involved uh both
 
03:23:09.910 --> 03:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
the current individual beneficiaries who
 
03:23:12.510 --> 03:23:12.520 align:start position:0%
had theoretically received more uh in a
 
03:23:14.910 --> 03:23:14.920 align:start position:0%
in a trust that was growing and uh and
 
03:23:16.110 --> 03:23:16.120 align:start position:0%
the remainder beneficiaries who would
 
03:23:18.429 --> 03:23:18.439 align:start position:0%
also benefit uh from a growth uh growth
 
03:23:20.630 --> 03:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
structured uh portfolio as well and it's
 
03:23:23.309 --> 03:23:23.319 align:start position:0%
fairly common I should add that um the
 
03:23:25.790 --> 03:23:25.800 align:start position:0%
remainder beneficiaries are charitable
 
03:23:27.830 --> 03:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh institutions or otherwise that's that
 
03:23:29.710 --> 03:23:29.720 align:start position:0%
that's a fairly typical way to use a
 
03:23:32.070 --> 03:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
unit so I think there's some benefit
 
03:23:35.670 --> 03:23:35.680 align:start position:0%
there to be able to do that right at the
 
03:23:35.680 --> 03:23:37.830 align:start position:0%
there to be able to do that right at the
outset

03:23:37.830 --> 03:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
outset
 
03:23:40.590 --> 03:23:40.600 align:start position:0%
okay um so so that's the second piece
 
03:23:43.710 --> 03:23:43.720 align:start position:0%
the third one uh is uh a clarification
 
03:23:44.990 --> 03:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
um and this is a completely different
 
03:23:47.630 --> 03:23:47.640 align:start position:0%
section of the trust code um uh and
 
03:23:49.309 --> 03:23:49.319 align:start position:0%
requires a little bit of background so
 
03:23:50.429 --> 03:23:50.439 align:start position:0%
bear with me for a couple minutes to
 
03:23:53.590 --> 03:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
kind of explain this uh uh in a
 
03:23:56.870 --> 03:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
traditional trust uh the governance of a
 
03:23:59.349 --> 03:23:59.359 align:start position:0%
trust is is uh the responsibility of a
 
03:24:02.110 --> 03:24:02.120 align:start position:0%
trustee and very big picture a trustee
 
03:24:05.389 --> 03:24:05.399 align:start position:0%
has three fundamental responsibilities
 
03:24:08.389 --> 03:24:08.399 align:start position:0%
one is to decide on distributions to the
 
03:24:10.630 --> 03:24:10.640 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries uh and that could you know
 
03:24:14.110 --> 03:24:14.120 align:start position:0%
deciding when how much for what purpose
 
03:24:15.510 --> 03:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
to make distributions to the
 
03:24:17.070 --> 03:24:17.080 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries in ordance with the terms
 
03:24:18.670 --> 03:24:18.680 align:start position:0%
of the trust document that's one of the
 
03:24:20.870 --> 03:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
fundamental Powers distributions the
 
03:24:23.150 --> 03:24:23.160 align:start position:0%
second is to decide on investments how
 
03:24:25.630 --> 03:24:25.640 align:start position:0%
to invest the Assets in the trust uh to
 
03:24:28.510 --> 03:24:28.520 align:start position:0%
preserve the Corpus grow it um and and
 
03:24:30.510 --> 03:24:30.520 align:start position:0%
generally speaking be fully in charge
 
03:24:31.990 --> 03:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
and cloaked with all the powers on the
 
03:24:34.550 --> 03:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
investment side and then the third is to
 
03:24:36.349 --> 03:24:36.359 align:start position:0%
handle all the administrative
 
03:24:37.910 --> 03:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
responsibilities uh that a trust
 
03:24:39.550 --> 03:24:39.560 align:start position:0%
requires that's your bookkeeping your
 
03:24:42.389 --> 03:24:42.399 align:start position:0%
accounting recordkeeping paying taxes so
 
03:24:45.990 --> 03:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
on and so forth um in New Hampshire as
 
03:24:49.030 --> 03:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
part of the modernization uh that uh
 
03:24:52.750 --> 03:24:52.760 align:start position:0%
Senator delandra referenced uh we have
 
03:24:55.950 --> 03:24:55.960 align:start position:0%
taken those three powers of uh of a
 
03:24:58.269 --> 03:24:58.279 align:start position:0%
trustee and allowed for people to
 
03:25:01.189 --> 03:25:01.199 align:start position:0%
bifurcate those into their own uh
 
03:25:03.510 --> 03:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
component parts and so by virtue of that
 
03:25:05.590 --> 03:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
you could have a governance structure
 
03:25:07.389 --> 03:25:07.399 align:start position:0%
where you have one person who's maybe
 
03:25:09.710 --> 03:25:09.720 align:start position:0%
close to the family who's in charge of
 
03:25:11.670 --> 03:25:11.680 align:start position:0%
distributions only that's all they're
 
03:25:13.309 --> 03:25:13.319 align:start position:0%
responsible for they don't have anything
 
03:25:14.710 --> 03:25:14.720 align:start position:0%
to do with Investments they have nothing
 
03:25:16.670 --> 03:25:16.680 align:start position:0%
to do with the uh the administ ative
 
03:25:19.110 --> 03:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
Powers all they're deciding as when for
 
03:25:21.469 --> 03:25:21.479 align:start position:0%
what purpose um and the amount to
 
03:25:23.389 --> 03:25:23.399 align:start position:0%
distribute to beneficiaries second
 
03:25:25.189 --> 03:25:25.199 align:start position:0%
sliver is the Investments that's all
 
03:25:27.030 --> 03:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
they're responsible for is the
 
03:25:28.429 --> 03:25:28.439 align:start position:0%
Investments and then the third is the
 
03:25:29.790 --> 03:25:29.800 align:start position:0%
administrative functions and that's
 
03:25:31.189 --> 03:25:31.199 align:start position:0%
where a lot of trust companies like
 
03:25:33.950 --> 03:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
Jordan Park Trust Company um now iqq
 
03:25:36.030 --> 03:25:36.040 align:start position:0%
trust company uh have borne out and
 
03:25:37.590 --> 03:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
that's where we have a really powerful
 
03:25:39.990 --> 03:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
industry um created a lot of jobs in New
 
03:25:42.070 --> 03:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire through uh trust companies
 
03:25:44.349 --> 03:25:44.359 align:start position:0%
serving in that administrative function
 
03:25:47.189 --> 03:25:47.199 align:start position:0%
only what was
 
03:25:50.030 --> 03:25:50.040 align:start position:0%
uh uh part of the statutory scheme in
 
03:25:52.110 --> 03:25:52.120 align:start position:0%
order to develop that uh and to get
 
03:25:54.070 --> 03:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
trust uh the the people serving in their
 
03:25:55.950 --> 03:25:55.960 align:start position:0%
various component parts comfortable in
 
03:25:57.990 --> 03:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
serving in those roles uh was a
 
03:25:59.510 --> 03:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
provision in the code that says that you
 
03:26:02.110 --> 03:26:02.120 align:start position:0%
are only responsible for your component
 
03:26:03.910 --> 03:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
part if you are respon if you're
 
03:26:05.990 --> 03:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
responsible for distributions and the
 
03:26:08.349 --> 03:26:08.359 align:start position:0%
Investments are handled poorly you're
 
03:26:10.269 --> 03:26:10.279 align:start position:0%
not responsible for that you can't be
 
03:26:12.229 --> 03:26:12.239 align:start position:0%
brought to brought to bear for the
 
03:26:13.670 --> 03:26:13.680 align:start position:0%
responsibility of someone else even
 
03:26:15.229 --> 03:26:15.239 align:start position:0%
though you're all collectively part of
 
03:26:17.349 --> 03:26:17.359 align:start position:0%
the same trust instrument
 
03:26:19.710 --> 03:26:19.720 align:start position:0%
um uh and that gave everybody comfort
 
03:26:21.510 --> 03:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
that okay I'm I'm only responsible for
 
03:26:23.349 --> 03:26:23.359 align:start position:0%
my component part I'm not responsible
 
03:26:25.189 --> 03:26:25.199 align:start position:0%
for others and I'm I'm therefore willing
 
03:26:26.469 --> 03:26:26.479 align:start position:0%
to do
 
03:26:29.830 --> 03:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
this when we went through as we do every
 
03:26:31.550 --> 03:26:31.560 align:start position:0%
year uh trying to make sure that our
 
03:26:33.870 --> 03:26:33.880 align:start position:0%
trust code is optimized and modernized
 
03:26:36.910 --> 03:26:36.920 align:start position:0%
we recognized that there was a uh an
 
03:26:40.110 --> 03:26:40.120 align:start position:0%
absence of clarity as to a specific
 
03:26:41.790 --> 03:26:41.800 align:start position:0%
aspect of trust Administration that
 
03:26:43.790 --> 03:26:43.800 align:start position:0%
could arise in that divided trust
 
03:26:46.830 --> 03:26:46.840 align:start position:0%
governance and that is if I am the
 
03:26:49.229 --> 03:26:49.239 align:start position:0%
um if I am the investment director say
 
03:26:51.830 --> 03:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
I'm solely in charge of Investments and
 
03:26:53.710 --> 03:26:53.720 align:start position:0%
the distribution director who's in
 
03:26:55.750 --> 03:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
charge of just distributions say the
 
03:26:58.110 --> 03:26:58.120 align:start position:0%
distribution director uh uh makes a
 
03:27:00.269 --> 03:27:00.279 align:start position:0%
distribution to somebody who is not a
 
03:27:02.469 --> 03:27:02.479 align:start position:0%
beneficiary that would be a serious
 
03:27:05.670 --> 03:27:05.680 align:start position:0%
breach of trust and if I know about that
 
03:27:07.469 --> 03:27:07.479 align:start position:0%
even though I'm not responsible for that
 
03:27:10.710 --> 03:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
person's actions do I have a duty to
 
03:27:13.110 --> 03:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
redress it do I have a duty to try to
 
03:27:15.189 --> 03:27:15.199 align:start position:0%
either Sue or bring some kind of action
 
03:27:17.990 --> 03:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
to redress that that uh that breach of
 
03:27:21.630 --> 03:27:21.640 align:start position:0%
of trust and where we try to draw the
 
03:27:25.269 --> 03:27:25.279 align:start position:0%
line uh so that people are um keeping a
 
03:27:27.469 --> 03:27:27.479 align:start position:0%
general overview of what's going on with
 
03:27:29.830 --> 03:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
the trust RIT large but not necessarily
 
03:27:31.670 --> 03:27:31.680 align:start position:0%
being responsible for what other people
 
03:27:34.349 --> 03:27:34.359 align:start position:0%
are doing is we said if there is a
 
03:27:37.229 --> 03:27:37.239 align:start position:0%
serious breach of trust serious being
 
03:27:39.550 --> 03:27:39.560 align:start position:0%
the component word uh or the important
 
03:27:43.830 --> 03:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
word uh then you are responsible as the
 
03:27:45.550 --> 03:27:45.560 align:start position:0%
as a fiduciary of that trust to try to
 
03:27:47.189 --> 03:27:47.199 align:start position:0%
redress that breach so if there's a
 
03:27:49.150 --> 03:27:49.160 align:start position:0%
serious breach you are responsible to
 
03:27:51.349 --> 03:27:51.359 align:start position:0%
try to fix it but if there's just a
 
03:27:54.510 --> 03:27:54.520 align:start position:0%
general breach uh that that is that just
 
03:27:56.910 --> 03:27:56.920 align:start position:0%
happens in the ordinary course we don't
 
03:28:00.030 --> 03:28:00.040 align:start position:0%
want to have the administrative trustee
 
03:28:03.590 --> 03:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
be on the hook for having to sue their
 
03:28:06.630 --> 03:28:06.640 align:start position:0%
co- fiduciary uh for a breach that would
 
03:28:08.510 --> 03:28:08.520 align:start position:0%
be the responsibility of the beneficiary
 
03:28:09.990 --> 03:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
the person who is ultimately receiving
 
03:28:12.750 --> 03:28:12.760 align:start position:0%
the benefit of the trust uh to to
 
03:28:14.630 --> 03:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
redress if they thought it was necessary
 
03:28:16.590 --> 03:28:16.600 align:start position:0%
to do so and leaving it to their hands
 
03:28:19.830 --> 03:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
to to to bring up uh lawsuits if there
 
03:28:22.229 --> 03:28:22.239 align:start position:0%
was an issue but not as between the
 
03:28:25.550 --> 03:28:25.560 align:start position:0%
fiduciaries themselves um that was not
 
03:28:28.269 --> 03:28:28.279 align:start position:0%
clearly laid out in the statute uh and
 
03:28:31.189 --> 03:28:31.199 align:start position:0%
so part of our clarification here is to
 
03:28:33.630 --> 03:28:33.640 align:start position:0%
say that a divided
 
03:28:36.870 --> 03:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
truste uh is responsible to clar to
 
03:28:38.830 --> 03:28:38.840 align:start position:0%
redress breaches of trust if there is a
 
03:28:41.870 --> 03:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
serious breach but not responsible uh to
 
03:28:44.189 --> 03:28:44.199 align:start position:0%
sue their co-trustees if it's just a
 
03:28:45.790 --> 03:28:45.800 align:start position:0%
regular breach and that that Duty would
 
03:28:48.269 --> 03:28:48.279 align:start position:0%
fall instead to the beneficiary uh who's
 
03:28:49.910 --> 03:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
the one that's ultimately receiving the
 
03:28:52.349 --> 03:28:52.359 align:start position:0%
benefit and would be most interested in
 
03:28:54.070 --> 03:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
um making sure that there aren't
 
03:28:56.189 --> 03:28:56.199 align:start position:0%
breaches so sorry that was a longwinded
 
03:28:58.030 --> 03:28:58.040 align:start position:0%
way of of kind of highlighting the big
 
03:29:00.349 --> 03:29:00.359 align:start position:0%
three and happy to answer any questions
 
03:29:06.070 --> 03:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:08.670 --> 03:29:08.680 align:start position:0%
first oh could you thank you could use
 
03:29:10.510 --> 03:29:10.520 align:start position:0%
the microphone please thank if you found
 
03:29:15.110 --> 03:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
that a a produci had not not followed
 
03:29:16.910 --> 03:29:16.920 align:start position:0%
their the rules
 
03:29:18.510 --> 03:29:18.520 align:start position:0%
and you were another
 
03:29:21.990 --> 03:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
fiduciary um would you be responsible
 
03:29:24.830 --> 03:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
for telling the the owner of the
 
03:29:28.309 --> 03:29:28.319 align:start position:0%
trust uh I found this I'm not going to
 
03:29:29.670 --> 03:29:29.680 align:start position:0%
do anything about it but you need to be
 
03:29:31.349 --> 03:29:31.359 align:start position:0%
aware that I found
 
03:29:33.830 --> 03:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
this great question and in the current
 
03:29:37.389 --> 03:29:37.399 align:start position:0%
trust uh statute uh there is actually
 
03:29:39.990 --> 03:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
spec spec specific language on that
 
03:29:43.389 --> 03:29:43.399 align:start position:0%
piece and um it provides and this is
 
03:29:46.870 --> 03:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
under um uh not that you probably this
 
03:29:49.750 --> 03:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
under Section 124 and it says that a uh
 
03:29:52.389 --> 03:29:52.399 align:start position:0%
fiduciary who's only responsible for one
 
03:29:55.189 --> 03:29:55.199 align:start position:0%
aspect has no Duty uh with respect to
 
03:29:57.830 --> 03:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
those serving in another capacity to
 
03:30:01.550 --> 03:30:01.560 align:start position:0%
monitor their conduct to uh advise the
 
03:30:04.349 --> 03:30:04.359 align:start position:0%
other trustees uh or the beneficiaries
 
03:30:07.110 --> 03:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
of their conduct uh or to communicate or
 
03:30:10.950 --> 03:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
warn the beneficiaries of any um uh
 
03:30:12.510 --> 03:30:12.520 align:start position:0%
potential concerning issues that might
 
03:30:14.630 --> 03:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
arise and so by virtue of that in the
 
03:30:16.750 --> 03:30:16.760 align:start position:0%
industry we have always kind of assumed
 
03:30:19.790 --> 03:30:19.800 align:start position:0%
that by virtue of those very limited um
 
03:30:22.030 --> 03:30:22.040 align:start position:0%
obligations with respect to dealing with
 
03:30:24.550 --> 03:30:24.560 align:start position:0%
your co- fiduciaries uh that there was
 
03:30:27.950 --> 03:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
no duty to redress a breach um I'm
 
03:30:30.070 --> 03:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
responsible for my conduct and my
 
03:30:32.469 --> 03:30:32.479 align:start position:0%
conduct alone I don't have to deal with
 
03:30:33.670 --> 03:30:33.680 align:start position:0%
what the others are doing the
 
03:30:35.389 --> 03:30:35.399 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries ultimately will deal with
 
03:30:38.030 --> 03:30:38.040 align:start position:0%
them if there's an issue that arises and
 
03:30:41.269 --> 03:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
so the circumstance here that was
 
03:30:43.429 --> 03:30:43.439 align:start position:0%
somewhat uh unclear but that pops up
 
03:30:44.590 --> 03:30:44.600 align:start position:0%
every now and again is what if you
 
03:30:46.189 --> 03:30:46.199 align:start position:0%
actually become aware of it I know have
 
03:30:48.030 --> 03:30:48.040 align:start position:0%
no duty to advise I have no duty to
 
03:30:49.870 --> 03:30:49.880 align:start position:0%
monitor I have no duty to communicate
 
03:30:52.189 --> 03:30:52.199 align:start position:0%
but what if I know about it and what we
 
03:30:53.670 --> 03:30:53.680 align:start position:0%
were saying is that if you know about it
 
03:30:55.910 --> 03:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
and it's a serious breach then you
 
03:30:57.229 --> 03:30:57.239 align:start position:0%
should you should be responsible for
 
03:30:59.150 --> 03:30:59.160 align:start position:0%
having to fix it or at least try to fix
 
03:31:01.630 --> 03:31:01.640 align:start position:0%
it if it's just a if it's just a you
 
03:31:04.630 --> 03:31:04.640 align:start position:0%
know a a a minor breach leave it to the
 
03:31:06.229 --> 03:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries to decide whether or not
 
03:31:08.990 --> 03:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
to incur the cost and the time and
 
03:31:13.469 --> 03:31:13.479 align:start position:0%
expense of of uh trying to redress
 
03:31:16.349 --> 03:31:16.359 align:start position:0%
it if I may without being tooo cial
 
03:31:18.550 --> 03:31:18.560 align:start position:0%
about it um it's a Brother's Keeper kind
 
03:31:21.229 --> 03:31:21.239 align:start position:0%
of a setup which allows for people as
 
03:31:23.070 --> 03:31:23.080 align:start position:0%
Patrick said to have the Comfort level
 
03:31:26.750 --> 03:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
to serve in a in a a very narrow
 
03:31:29.710 --> 03:31:29.720 align:start position:0%
capacity um but you know at the same
 
03:31:31.349 --> 03:31:31.359 align:start position:0%
time there's always an underlying
 
03:31:34.349 --> 03:31:34.359 align:start position:0%
fiduciary duty you know to do the right
 
03:31:37.469 --> 03:31:37.479 align:start position:0%
thing as a trustee so I can imagine any
 
03:31:38.910 --> 03:31:38.920 align:start position:0%
circumstances where you might well
 
03:31:41.030 --> 03:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
advise this is more about like do you
 
03:31:43.670 --> 03:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
actually have to go you know for the
 
03:31:46.110 --> 03:31:46.120 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries sake and bring a loss suit
 
03:31:48.550 --> 03:31:48.560 align:start position:0%
or otherwise take extraordinary steps
 
03:31:48.560 --> 03:31:49.349 align:start position:0%
or otherwise take extraordinary steps
and

03:31:49.349 --> 03:31:49.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:31:52.910 --> 03:31:52.920 align:start position:0%
so the balance is to allow trustees to
 
03:31:55.269 --> 03:31:55.279 align:start position:0%
do what we've given them the power to do
 
03:31:57.950 --> 03:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
for settlers which is to Avail
 
03:32:00.349 --> 03:32:00.359 align:start position:0%
themselves of this very structure
 
03:32:02.429 --> 03:32:02.439 align:start position:0%
without kind of being in a
 
03:32:05.469 --> 03:32:05.479 align:start position:0%
catch22 um where they're treated for
 
03:32:07.150 --> 03:32:07.160 align:start position:0%
liability purposes as if they were a
 
03:32:10.309 --> 03:32:10.319 align:start position:0%
full Trustee of all aspects but they
 
03:32:13.630 --> 03:32:13.640 align:start position:0%
really don't have the power um and or
 
03:32:16.469 --> 03:32:16.479 align:start position:0%
necessarily the reach to even know
 
03:32:18.189 --> 03:32:18.199 align:start position:0%
what exactly is going on with an
 
03:32:20.790 --> 03:32:20.800 align:start position:0%
administrative with a investment advisor
 
03:32:23.189 --> 03:32:23.199 align:start position:0%
say and this is what you know these are
 
03:32:25.830 --> 03:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
Arrangements that our clients come to us
 
03:32:29.110 --> 03:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
for uh because they have a preferred
 
03:32:31.389 --> 03:32:31.399 align:start position:0%
investment advisor already or because
 
03:32:33.229 --> 03:32:33.239 align:start position:0%
they have a good friend who's going to
 
03:32:34.910 --> 03:32:34.920 align:start position:0%
serve in this or that capacity or they
 
03:32:37.750 --> 03:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
want um family members to make decisions
 
03:32:39.469 --> 03:32:39.479 align:start position:0%
about beneficiaries that sort of thing
 
03:32:41.070 --> 03:32:41.080 align:start position:0%
so it's really a matter of trying to
 
03:32:44.150 --> 03:32:44.160 align:start position:0%
strike an appropriate balance where
 
03:32:45.830 --> 03:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries aren't left without re
 
03:32:48.189 --> 03:32:48.199 align:start position:0%
recourse and no one is looking out for
 
03:32:51.150 --> 03:32:51.160 align:start position:0%
anything but it uh it invites
 
03:32:54.389 --> 03:32:54.399 align:start position:0%
practitioners to engage in in in all of
 
03:32:57.630 --> 03:32:57.640 align:start position:0%
this questions for this witness yes
 
03:33:00.469 --> 03:33:00.479 align:start position:0%
representative Manos thank you Mr chair
 
03:33:02.710 --> 03:33:02.720 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my question I'm
 
03:33:05.269 --> 03:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
confused about the unitary trust and I
 
03:33:06.910 --> 03:33:06.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to hear more about that and
 
03:33:08.830 --> 03:33:08.840 align:start position:0%
specifically I was confused about the
 
03:33:11.150 --> 03:33:11.160 align:start position:0%
example you used of the Widow and the
 
03:33:13.670 --> 03:33:13.680 align:start position:0%
children and let's assume you have a
 
03:33:17.790 --> 03:33:17.800 align:start position:0%
very high income earner and um a spouse
 
03:33:21.510 --> 03:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
who has had minimal income and so the
 
03:33:25.510 --> 03:33:25.520 align:start position:0%
high income earner wants to create as
 
03:33:29.830 --> 03:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
maximize income for the surviving spouse
 
03:33:33.469 --> 03:33:33.479 align:start position:0%
um and the tension between that and the
 
03:33:35.710 --> 03:33:35.720 align:start position:0%
children could you just talk more about
 
03:33:39.309 --> 03:33:39.319 align:start position:0%
that because I'm confused you you
 
03:33:42.830 --> 03:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
you I'm confused because obviously the
 
03:33:45.429 --> 03:33:45.439 align:start position:0%
gror has to be alive when you make that
 
03:33:47.630 --> 03:33:47.640 align:start position:0%
choice and so the gr tour is part of
 
03:33:49.670 --> 03:33:49.680 align:start position:0%
this decision Mak process so I'm clear
 
03:33:51.870 --> 03:33:51.880 align:start position:0%
on that but then I was confused about
 
03:33:54.990 --> 03:33:55.000 align:start position:0%
transition of standard trust to a
 
03:33:58.309 --> 03:33:58.319 align:start position:0%
unitary trust and how that works and
 
03:34:00.750 --> 03:34:00.760 align:start position:0%
sure just walk me through that cluster
 
03:34:02.269 --> 03:34:02.279 align:start position:0%
of issues totally totally understand so
 
03:34:04.950 --> 03:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
let me let me start with the the uh
 
03:34:06.630 --> 03:34:06.640 align:start position:0%
transition from an existing traditional
 
03:34:08.150 --> 03:34:08.160 align:start position:0%
trust to a unit trust which is already
 
03:34:10.150 --> 03:34:10.160 align:start position:0%
permitted under the statute that
 
03:34:12.309 --> 03:34:12.319 align:start position:0%
requires notice first to all the
 
03:34:13.870 --> 03:34:13.880 align:start position:0%
qualified beneficiaries of which in that
 
03:34:16.750 --> 03:34:16.760 align:start position:0%
case the Widow would be a a recipient of
 
03:34:18.670 --> 03:34:18.680 align:start position:0%
a notice and the trustee would say hey
 
03:34:20.189 --> 03:34:20.199 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm thinking it's in your best
 
03:34:22.469 --> 03:34:22.479 align:start position:0%
interest to go from a you from a
 
03:34:23.670 --> 03:34:23.680 align:start position:0%
traditional trust where you're only
 
03:34:25.950 --> 03:34:25.960 align:start position:0%
getting income to a unit trust where you
 
03:34:28.030 --> 03:34:28.040 align:start position:0%
can you can share in the growth of the
 
03:34:30.429 --> 03:34:30.439 align:start position:0%
trust and uh the Widow would then have
 
03:34:32.469 --> 03:34:32.479 align:start position:0%
the option to say no I don't I don't
 
03:34:33.950 --> 03:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
like that and then that squashes it
 
03:34:36.790 --> 03:34:36.800 align:start position:0%
completely there's no they can't be uh
 
03:34:39.510 --> 03:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
unilaterally forced into that structure
 
03:34:41.630 --> 03:34:41.640 align:start position:0%
uh in in the event of a change from what
 
03:34:43.229 --> 03:34:43.239 align:start position:0%
currently exists to to the new structure
 
03:34:45.309 --> 03:34:45.319 align:start position:0%
they have to be they have to not object
 
03:34:47.630 --> 03:34:47.640 align:start position:0%
to to that
 
03:34:50.150 --> 03:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
um in in what we're trying to do in this
 
03:34:52.750 --> 03:34:52.760 align:start position:0%
one is go I I'm sorry I just want to add
 
03:34:55.389 --> 03:34:55.399 align:start position:0%
um because I mentioned Charities um in
 
03:34:58.189 --> 03:34:58.199 align:start position:0%
any unit uh conversion to unit where
 
03:35:00.269 --> 03:35:00.279 align:start position:0%
there was a charitable component there's
 
03:35:01.950 --> 03:35:01.960 align:start position:0%
already requirements that the charitable
 
03:35:04.070 --> 03:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
trust director be notified as well so
 
03:35:06.070 --> 03:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
like the beneficiaries if there's a
 
03:35:08.150 --> 03:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
charity involved and charitable trust
 
03:35:11.510 --> 03:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
unit has the ability to go to court or
 
03:35:14.269 --> 03:35:14.279 align:start position:0%
whatever they just object yeah yeah and
 
03:35:16.750 --> 03:35:16.760 align:start position:0%
and in what we're to do here is just
 
03:35:18.910 --> 03:35:18.920 align:start position:0%
provide another option for grant tours
 
03:35:21.510 --> 03:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
when they're trying to devise uh their
 
03:35:25.670 --> 03:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
estate plan essentially so uh in in the
 
03:35:27.790 --> 03:35:27.800 align:start position:0%
in the panoply of options they have now
 
03:35:31.510 --> 03:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
they could say I want to have my trust
 
03:35:33.910 --> 03:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
uh for my spouse be uh completely
 
03:35:35.469 --> 03:35:35.479 align:start position:0%
discretionary I want to name a trustee
 
03:35:37.349 --> 03:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
might be the spouse might be a third
 
03:35:39.269 --> 03:35:39.279 align:start position:0%
party trustee can make distributions in
 
03:35:41.229 --> 03:35:41.239 align:start position:0%
any amount any time for any reason a
 
03:35:44.030 --> 03:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
very broad full of discretion uh and
 
03:35:45.189 --> 03:35:45.199 align:start position:0%
that's usually the case for first
 
03:35:46.950 --> 03:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
marriages could be a second marriage
 
03:35:48.389 --> 03:35:48.399 align:start position:0%
where you each have kids from different
 
03:35:50.229 --> 03:35:50.239 align:start position:0%
from from prior marriages and you say I
 
03:35:52.670 --> 03:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
want to benefit my spouse but I want to
 
03:35:55.269 --> 03:35:55.279 align:start position:0%
make absolute sure that whatever is left
 
03:35:57.590 --> 03:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
goes to my kids and doesn't go to some
 
03:36:00.790 --> 03:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
future spouse or to my new spouse's kids
 
03:36:02.710 --> 03:36:02.720 align:start position:0%
and so I want to Define what that
 
03:36:05.790 --> 03:36:05.800 align:start position:0%
interest is that my spouse gets and
 
03:36:08.110 --> 03:36:08.120 align:start position:0%
currently the optionality would be you
 
03:36:10.429 --> 03:36:10.439 align:start position:0%
could you could have it' be an income
 
03:36:12.670 --> 03:36:12.680 align:start position:0%
interest where you say my spouse should
 
03:36:14.510 --> 03:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
get the income from the trust and my
 
03:36:16.990 --> 03:36:17.000 align:start position:0%
kids get whatever is left over uh you
 
03:36:20.030 --> 03:36:20.040 align:start position:0%
could say my spouse gets a dollar amount
 
03:36:22.189 --> 03:36:22.199 align:start position:0%
you know she gets or he or she gets
 
03:36:24.910 --> 03:36:24.920 align:start position:0%
$100,000 a year and that's it and then
 
03:36:26.830 --> 03:36:26.840 align:start position:0%
everything that's left goes to my kids
 
03:36:28.950 --> 03:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
what is not currently in there is the
 
03:36:31.389 --> 03:36:31.399 align:start position:0%
concept of a percentage to say my spouse
 
03:36:34.349 --> 03:36:34.359 align:start position:0%
should get and the the percentage that
 
03:36:38.070 --> 03:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
we're targeting here is is 3 to 5% you
 
03:36:41.830 --> 03:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
can get and as it as a comparison to the
 
03:36:44.670 --> 03:36:44.680 align:start position:0%
income interest um so it's just to say
 
03:36:46.030 --> 03:36:46.040 align:start position:0%
you get three to 5
 
03:36:48.710 --> 03:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
% that's it and then and which allows
 
03:36:50.070 --> 03:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
the trust to continue to grow you can
 
03:36:51.750 --> 03:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
invest in grow stocks and you get to you
 
03:36:53.389 --> 03:36:53.399 align:start position:0%
get to share in that growth and then
 
03:36:55.389 --> 03:36:55.399 align:start position:0%
whatever's left over would go to the
 
03:36:58.269 --> 03:36:58.279 align:start position:0%
kids um it's not a requirement it's just
 
03:37:00.309 --> 03:37:00.319 align:start position:0%
we're just trying to add to the flexible
 
03:37:02.830 --> 03:37:02.840 align:start position:0%
options that a that a grantor uh would
 
03:37:05.070 --> 03:37:05.080 align:start position:0%
have when trying to determine what the
 
03:37:06.389 --> 03:37:06.399 align:start position:0%
either in our case that we're talking
 
03:37:08.229 --> 03:37:08.239 align:start position:0%
about here what the surviving spouse
 
03:37:11.150 --> 03:37:11.160 align:start position:0%
would have and there's a lot of
 
03:37:13.550 --> 03:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
literature if you Google this unitrust
 
03:37:14.990 --> 03:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
uh there's a lot of literature on this
 
03:37:18.429 --> 03:37:18.439 align:start position:0%
that uh shows that over uh the course of
 
03:37:21.150 --> 03:37:21.160 align:start position:0%
at least American history the percentage
 
03:37:23.269 --> 03:37:23.279 align:start position:0%
distribution standard results in a
 
03:37:25.110 --> 03:37:25.120 align:start position:0%
better outcome both for that current
 
03:37:26.429 --> 03:37:26.439 align:start position:0%
beneficiary which in our case would be
 
03:37:27.670 --> 03:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
the spouse and the remainder
 
03:37:29.269 --> 03:37:29.279 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries because investing for
 
03:37:32.550 --> 03:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
growth has investing you know in America
 
03:37:35.510 --> 03:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
essentially has has way outperformed
 
03:37:38.469 --> 03:37:38.479 align:start position:0%
incom producing Investments and one
 
03:37:40.990 --> 03:37:41.000 align:start position:0%
thing I would add is if you create a
 
03:37:44.429 --> 03:37:44.439 align:start position:0%
unit trust under this uh under these
 
03:37:47.830 --> 03:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
provisions unrea it would involve the
 
03:37:51.269 --> 03:37:51.279 align:start position:0%
same kind of notice so whether you start
 
03:37:53.309 --> 03:37:53.319 align:start position:0%
out with a traditional
 
03:37:56.990 --> 03:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
trust revocable trust or you or you uh
 
03:37:58.910 --> 03:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
start with a unit trust if you were
 
03:38:00.389 --> 03:38:00.399 align:start position:0%
going to make that change it's the same
 
03:38:03.070 --> 03:38:03.080 align:start position:0%
sort of a thing got notif my
 
03:38:06.870 --> 03:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries so may other questions may
 
03:38:10.189 --> 03:38:10.199 align:start position:0%
I just ask question so I'm on the uh so
 
03:38:11.990 --> 03:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
if in the you know to use your example
 
03:38:13.510 --> 03:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
of the like what would have been the
 
03:38:15.550 --> 03:38:15.560 align:start position:0%
income beneficiary in the past will now
 
03:38:18.469 --> 03:38:18.479 align:start position:0%
now be uh sort of a principal
 
03:38:20.349 --> 03:38:20.359 align:start position:0%
beneficiary but only to a percentage of
 
03:38:22.990 --> 03:38:23.000 align:start position:0%
the trust like let's say 3% or whatever
 
03:38:23.000 --> 03:38:24.389 align:start position:0%
the trust like let's say 3% or whatever
if

03:38:24.389 --> 03:38:24.399 align:start position:0%
if
 
03:38:27.110 --> 03:38:27.120 align:start position:0%
the I assume that you would then specify
 
03:38:30.510 --> 03:38:30.520 align:start position:0%
in the trust when that percentage is
 
03:38:33.269 --> 03:38:33.279 align:start position:0%
calculated in other words if you wanted
 
03:38:36.870 --> 03:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
if you wanted the the former income
 
03:38:40.349 --> 03:38:40.359 align:start position:0%
beneficiary now 3% beneficiary to get
 
03:38:44.950 --> 03:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
that person's money next year um you say
 
03:38:46.550 --> 03:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
that in the trust and then the rest of
 
03:38:49.110 --> 03:38:49.120 align:start position:0%
it the other 97% if it was not going to
 
03:38:50.790 --> 03:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
be distributed until later you'd say
 
03:38:52.750 --> 03:38:52.760 align:start position:0%
that also that's exactly right and and
 
03:38:55.269 --> 03:38:55.279 align:start position:0%
and the flexibility to Pivot within that
 
03:38:58.349 --> 03:38:58.359 align:start position:0%
range 3 to 5% if you wanted to increase
 
03:38:59.910 --> 03:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
or decrease that within the range it
 
03:39:02.550 --> 03:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
would require notice uh and approval
 
03:39:04.750 --> 03:39:04.760 align:start position:0%
essentially not objecting uh in order to
 
03:39:07.429 --> 03:39:07.439 align:start position:0%
make that to make that tweak I see okay
 
03:39:09.750 --> 03:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
and and you could just just to just
 
03:39:13.229 --> 03:39:13.239 align:start position:0%
to kind of frame this uh differently if
 
03:39:16.269 --> 03:39:16.279 align:start position:0%
in case this might help um
 
03:39:19.110 --> 03:39:19.120 align:start position:0%
if the trust code generally speaking
 
03:39:21.150 --> 03:39:21.160 align:start position:0%
gives a lot of discretion to set LS to
 
03:39:23.189 --> 03:39:23.199 align:start position:0%
be able to craft their plans however
 
03:39:27.950 --> 03:39:27.960 align:start position:0%
they want big picture um uh and so the
 
03:39:30.189 --> 03:39:30.199 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to you know devise a plan
 
03:39:31.990 --> 03:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
that said I want to
 
03:39:35.229 --> 03:39:35.239 align:start position:0%
give a third of this trust to my wife in
 
03:39:36.910 --> 03:39:36.920 align:start position:0%
year one a third the next year a third
 
03:39:38.429 --> 03:39:38.439 align:start position:0%
the following you could do that what
 
03:39:40.550 --> 03:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
this is really trying to do is say if
 
03:39:42.830 --> 03:39:42.840 align:start position:0%
you're interested in the concept of
 
03:39:45.030 --> 03:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
preserving principle for remainder
 
03:39:47.870 --> 03:39:47.880 align:start position:0%
benefit fici Aries the the optionality
 
03:39:48.950 --> 03:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
that you've had in the past has really
 
03:39:51.070 --> 03:39:51.080 align:start position:0%
been income to this current beneficiary
 
03:39:53.070 --> 03:39:53.080 align:start position:0%
or a dollar amount which they call like
 
03:39:55.269 --> 03:39:55.279 align:start position:0%
an annuity interest this is saying in
 
03:39:57.550 --> 03:39:57.560 align:start position:0%
addition to that you can devise that as
 
03:40:00.830 --> 03:40:00.840 align:start position:0%
a percentage and that percentage is 3 to
 
03:40:04.630 --> 03:40:04.640 align:start position:0%
5% if you're only trying to um create an
 
03:40:06.910 --> 03:40:06.920 align:start position:0%
alternative to an income interest
 
03:40:08.830 --> 03:40:08.840 align:start position:0%
preserving the principle for the
 
03:40:10.349 --> 03:40:10.359 align:start position:0%
remainder beneficiaries down the road
 
03:40:13.229 --> 03:40:13.239 align:start position:0%
and I should add the three to 5% is not
 
03:40:15.990 --> 03:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
a um out of the air number
 
03:40:18.269 --> 03:40:18.279 align:start position:0%
um in fact that under under current law
 
03:40:21.189 --> 03:40:21.199 align:start position:0%
I think it says 5 to8 or something that
 
03:40:23.990 --> 03:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
it has uh percentages that we believe
 
03:40:27.469 --> 03:40:27.479 align:start position:0%
looking at some IRS viewpoints um might
 
03:40:32.550 --> 03:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
not be uh H up in IRS scrutiny and 3 to5
 
03:40:36.070 --> 03:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
is what we've seen in in IRS uh letter
 
03:40:39.070 --> 03:40:39.080 align:start position:0%
rulings um we don't really know we've
 
03:40:41.670 --> 03:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
tried to research why it had numbers
 
03:40:42.950 --> 03:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
those numbers did not seem to come from
 
03:40:48.269 --> 03:40:48.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:51.349 --> 03:40:51.359 align:start position:0%
uh and and and so but we we saw that
 
03:40:53.269 --> 03:40:53.279 align:start position:0%
again more closely and said it would be
 
03:40:55.910 --> 03:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
really helpful if trustees and settlers
 
03:40:57.510 --> 03:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
could feel that what they're putting
 
03:40:59.910 --> 03:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
together would hold up to to IRS you
 
03:41:02.349 --> 03:41:02.359 align:start position:0%
know can you just enlight what what is
 
03:41:05.990 --> 03:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
the explain the IRS implication okay so
 
03:41:08.750 --> 03:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
so uh this gets a little technical but
 
03:41:11.189 --> 03:41:11.199 align:start position:0%
um if you
 
03:41:13.910 --> 03:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
um uh where do I start this so there is
 
03:41:16.950 --> 03:41:16.960 align:start position:0%
a federal estate tax exemption amount
 
03:41:18.910 --> 03:41:18.920 align:start position:0%
that every individual has that you can
 
03:41:22.149 --> 03:41:22.159 align:start position:0%
pass on to non-spouse beneficiaries free
 
03:41:24.550 --> 03:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
of estate taxes and currently it's a
 
03:41:27.110 --> 03:41:27.120 align:start position:0%
huge number it's 13.6 one million per
 
03:41:29.429 --> 03:41:29.439 align:start position:0%
person uh so a married couple gets
 
03:41:33.469 --> 03:41:33.479 align:start position:0%
double that 13.6 times two um uh that
 
03:41:35.030 --> 03:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
said if you have Assets in excess of
 
03:41:36.710 --> 03:41:36.720 align:start position:0%
that amount and you'd be subject to
 
03:41:38.550 --> 03:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
estate taxes on the death of the first
 
03:41:41.349 --> 03:41:41.359 align:start position:0%
spouse one way to try to avoid estate
 
03:41:42.950 --> 03:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
taxes at least on the death of first
 
03:41:46.030 --> 03:41:46.040 align:start position:0%
spouse is to leave assets to your spouse
 
03:41:47.870 --> 03:41:47.880 align:start position:0%
because there's an unlimited marital
 
03:41:49.790 --> 03:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
deduction you can leave a trillion
 
03:41:51.070 --> 03:41:51.080 align:start position:0%
dollars to your spouse on death and
 
03:41:52.750 --> 03:41:52.760 align:start position:0%
there's no estate taxes on the first
 
03:41:54.790 --> 03:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
death but if you say I don't really want
 
03:41:57.189 --> 03:41:57.199 align:start position:0%
to leave it outright to my spouse for
 
03:41:59.149 --> 03:41:59.159 align:start position:0%
the reasons we described before you're
 
03:42:00.950 --> 03:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
fearful of a subsequent remarriage
 
03:42:03.070 --> 03:42:03.080 align:start position:0%
you're fearful that this the sub the
 
03:42:04.229 --> 03:42:04.239 align:start position:0%
second the spouse is going to leave it
 
03:42:06.149 --> 03:42:06.159 align:start position:0%
to their kids and not your kids so you
 
03:42:08.830 --> 03:42:08.840 align:start position:0%
want to leave it in a trust uh for the
 
03:42:10.910 --> 03:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
benefit of that surviving spouse and
 
03:42:12.710 --> 03:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
have that trust qualify for the
 
03:42:15.750 --> 03:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
unlimited marital deduction that trust
 
03:42:18.349 --> 03:42:18.359 align:start position:0%
has to have two features one is that the
 
03:42:20.269 --> 03:42:20.279 align:start position:0%
surviving spouse has to be the sole
 
03:42:22.229 --> 03:42:22.239 align:start position:0%
beneficiary no one else can benefit but
 
03:42:24.510 --> 03:42:24.520 align:start position:0%
the surviving spouse and second at a
 
03:42:27.389 --> 03:42:27.399 align:start position:0%
minimum the spouse has to have the right
 
03:42:30.389 --> 03:42:30.399 align:start position:0%
to all of the income that the trust
 
03:42:33.110 --> 03:42:33.120 align:start position:0%
generates in a given year and what the
 
03:42:35.790 --> 03:42:35.800 align:start position:0%
unitrust statute the conversion statute
 
03:42:38.110 --> 03:42:38.120 align:start position:0%
has tried to to thread the needle on is
 
03:42:40.269 --> 03:42:40.279 align:start position:0%
to say we want to make sure that this
 
03:42:41.910 --> 03:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
trust is still qualifying for that
 
03:42:45.189 --> 03:42:45.199 align:start position:0%
unlimited meril deduction by giving a
 
03:42:46.830 --> 03:42:46.840 align:start position:0%
mandatory interest to the surviving
 
03:42:50.469 --> 03:42:50.479 align:start position:0%
spouse of income but defining that as a
 
03:42:53.429 --> 03:42:53.439 align:start position:0%
percentage of the trust as opposed to
 
03:42:55.269 --> 03:42:55.279 align:start position:0%
the dividends the interest on the bank
 
03:42:57.790 --> 03:42:57.800 align:start position:0%
accounts and so on and so forth and so
 
03:43:02.070 --> 03:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
the IRS has said 3 to 5% of the trust
 
03:43:04.830 --> 03:43:04.840 align:start position:0%
Corpus is effectively the equivalent of
 
03:43:07.030 --> 03:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
an income interest and they're okay with
 
03:43:08.750 --> 03:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
that and so that's what we're trying to
 
03:43:08.760 --> 03:43:11.309 align:start position:0%
that and so that's what we're trying to
tie

03:43:11.309 --> 03:43:11.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:13.510 --> 03:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
to yes representative
 
03:43:16.269 --> 03:43:16.279 align:start position:0%
trip thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
03:43:19.990 --> 03:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh you mentioned that
 
03:43:23.429 --> 03:43:23.439 align:start position:0%
uh whenever the trust is changed that
 
03:43:25.269 --> 03:43:25.279 align:start position:0%
you have to notice the
 
03:43:28.189 --> 03:43:28.199 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries uh what exactly do you
 
03:43:29.710 --> 03:43:29.720 align:start position:0%
mean by that do you are you talking
 
03:43:31.149 --> 03:43:31.159 align:start position:0%
about that it seems there's a couple
 
03:43:34.030 --> 03:43:34.040 align:start position:0%
tiers of beneficiaries there's the the
 
03:43:37.070 --> 03:43:37.080 align:start position:0%
uh spouse she's the primary beneficiary
 
03:43:39.550 --> 03:43:39.560 align:start position:0%
Y and then you have you know uh whoever
 
03:43:43.670 --> 03:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
else is uh identified in the trust their
 
03:43:47.229 --> 03:43:47.239 align:start position:0%
secondary uh beneficiaries so do they
 
03:43:50.590 --> 03:43:50.600 align:start position:0%
have to do you have to notify everyone
 
03:43:52.110 --> 03:43:52.120 align:start position:0%
yes so the great great question so the
 
03:43:54.670 --> 03:43:54.680 align:start position:0%
the technical term uh for the uh
 
03:43:56.950 --> 03:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
permissible or the required people who
 
03:43:59.309 --> 03:43:59.319 align:start position:0%
would receive notice is a qualified
 
03:44:01.510 --> 03:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
beneficiary which has two tiers
 
03:44:03.910 --> 03:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
qualified beneficiary means the person
 
03:44:06.469 --> 03:44:06.479 align:start position:0%
who has the current right to receive
 
03:44:08.309 --> 03:44:08.319 align:start position:0%
distributions from the trust and so in
 
03:44:09.469 --> 03:44:09.479 align:start position:0%
the example we're been talking about
 
03:44:11.349 --> 03:44:11.359 align:start position:0%
with a surviving spouse the spouse would
 
03:44:14.229 --> 03:44:14.239 align:start position:0%
be that person and the person who would
 
03:44:16.349 --> 03:44:16.359 align:start position:0%
receive the benefit from the trust if
 
03:44:18.670 --> 03:44:18.680 align:start position:0%
that current beneficiary died and so
 
03:44:21.590 --> 03:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
it's the first level of successor or
 
03:44:23.389 --> 03:44:23.399 align:start position:0%
remainder beneficiaries that's what a
 
03:44:25.670 --> 03:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
qualified beneficiary is you could go a
 
03:44:29.189 --> 03:44:29.199 align:start position:0%
step further and say well if my If my
 
03:44:31.750 --> 03:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
spouse dies and if that happened
 
03:44:33.309 --> 03:44:33.319 align:start position:0%
everything went to the kids I'll notify
 
03:44:35.269 --> 03:44:35.279 align:start position:0%
them and if all my kids and my spouse
 
03:44:37.269 --> 03:44:37.279 align:start position:0%
died then maybe it goes to charity the
 
03:44:39.630 --> 03:44:39.640 align:start position:0%
trust code does not require that next
 
03:44:42.429 --> 03:44:42.439 align:start position:0%
level of beneficial interest to be part
 
03:44:44.269 --> 03:44:44.279 align:start position:0%
of this because their interest is so
 
03:44:47.630 --> 03:44:47.640 align:start position:0%
remote um uh so it's just first level
 
03:44:49.550 --> 03:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
and second level and all of them have to
 
03:44:51.990 --> 03:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
be given notice and in the statute it
 
03:44:55.670 --> 03:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
gives them um a 60-day period uh to
 
03:44:57.469 --> 03:44:57.479 align:start position:0%
object uh so they'd receive it they'd
 
03:44:59.110 --> 03:44:59.120 align:start position:0%
have a period of time to object and if
 
03:45:01.389 --> 03:45:01.399 align:start position:0%
they object then you can't do it and I'm
 
03:45:03.469 --> 03:45:03.479 align:start position:0%
a wonky lawyer so I know that that that
 
03:45:07.030 --> 03:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
is rooted in standing and whether that
 
03:45:09.790 --> 03:45:09.800 align:start position:0%
person's interest uh is so remote As
 
03:45:12.030 --> 03:45:12.040 align:start position:0%
Patrick put it that they would not have
 
03:45:13.950 --> 03:45:13.960 align:start position:0%
standing to go out to court and assert
 
03:45:17.149 --> 03:45:17.159 align:start position:0%
their interest it's
 
03:45:19.429 --> 03:45:19.439 align:start position:0%
too representative
 
03:45:22.349 --> 03:45:22.359 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you Mr chair I apologize for
 
03:45:24.590 --> 03:45:24.600 align:start position:0%
being a few minutes late so I missed
 
03:45:27.149 --> 03:45:27.159 align:start position:0%
Senator de los Sandra's presentation but
 
03:45:29.429 --> 03:45:29.439 align:start position:0%
I think I've been here for all of
 
03:45:33.590 --> 03:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
yours and um I have a question that
 
03:45:40.870 --> 03:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:40.880 --> 03:45:43.110 align:start position:0%
 
understand

03:45:43.110 --> 03:45:43.120 align:start position:0%
understand
 
03:45:45.670 --> 03:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
where where does the
 
03:45:45.680 --> 03:45:47.309 align:start position:0%
where where does the
word

03:45:47.309 --> 03:45:47.319 align:start position:0%
word
 
03:45:50.630 --> 03:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
unitrust fit in where does that come
 
03:45:54.149 --> 03:45:54.159 align:start position:0%
from oh so yeah great question so um no
 
03:45:55.710 --> 03:45:55.720 align:start position:0%
it's not really a great question but
 
03:45:57.070 --> 03:45:57.080 align:start position:0%
you're just polite no because there's
 
03:45:58.429 --> 03:45:58.439 align:start position:0%
actually not a great answer for it so
 
03:46:00.110 --> 03:46:00.120 align:start position:0%
it's you're you're you're addressing a
 
03:46:04.149 --> 03:46:04.159 align:start position:0%
uh uh point that I've even questioned um
 
03:46:06.429 --> 03:46:06.439 align:start position:0%
when defining a beneficial interest in a
 
03:46:09.110 --> 03:46:09.120 align:start position:0%
trust or or maybe better said when
 
03:46:12.630 --> 03:46:12.640 align:start position:0%
defining the uh distribution standard uh
 
03:46:14.590 --> 03:46:14.600 align:start position:0%
that a trustee is responsible to carry
 
03:46:17.630 --> 03:46:17.640 align:start position:0%
out in a trust um uh we Define them in
 
03:46:19.750 --> 03:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
certain ways one is to say full
 
03:46:21.830 --> 03:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
discretion truste has full discretion to
 
03:46:23.349 --> 03:46:23.359 align:start position:0%
distribute as much as they want whenever
 
03:46:25.710 --> 03:46:25.720 align:start position:0%
they want for whatever purpose second is
 
03:46:27.750 --> 03:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
to Define it as an annuity to say that
 
03:46:30.870 --> 03:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
the beneficiary has uh a cash a certain
 
03:46:32.389 --> 03:46:32.399 align:start position:0%
dollar amount that they're entitled to
 
03:46:35.149 --> 03:46:35.159 align:start position:0%
receive every year uh and the grantor
 
03:46:36.990 --> 03:46:37.000 align:start position:0%
determines that 100,000 bucks 50,
 
03:46:39.790 --> 03:46:39.800 align:start position:0%
whatever the number might be um uh the
 
03:46:41.349 --> 03:46:41.359 align:start position:0%
third is an income interest which is
 
03:46:42.750 --> 03:46:42.760 align:start position:0%
what we were describing before which is
 
03:46:45.389 --> 03:46:45.399 align:start position:0%
you get the right to the income that the
 
03:46:47.750 --> 03:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
trust generates in a given year and then
 
03:46:49.389 --> 03:46:49.399 align:start position:0%
the fourth one is this unit trust why
 
03:46:51.269 --> 03:46:51.279 align:start position:0%
it's called that I have no idea but it's
 
03:46:54.349 --> 03:46:54.359 align:start position:0%
effectively trying to define the amount
 
03:46:57.110 --> 03:46:57.120 align:start position:0%
that someone can get as a percentage uh
 
03:46:58.510 --> 03:46:58.520 align:start position:0%
so you've got a dollar amount you've got
 
03:47:00.550 --> 03:47:00.560 align:start position:0%
income you've got full discretion and
 
03:47:02.710 --> 03:47:02.720 align:start position:0%
the unit trust why it's called that I
 
03:47:04.870 --> 03:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
don't know but it's it's trying to get
 
03:47:08.469 --> 03:47:08.479 align:start position:0%
at a percentage of the trust that is to
 
03:47:12.349 --> 03:47:12.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:17.429 --> 03:47:17.439 align:start position:0%
year thank you and how many States
 
03:47:17.439 --> 03:47:19.110 align:start position:0%
year thank you and how many States
um

03:47:19.110 --> 03:47:19.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:23.309 --> 03:47:23.319 align:start position:0%
have unit trust so um under the uh
 
03:47:24.630 --> 03:47:24.640 align:start position:0%
uniform trust code which I think is
 
03:47:28.710 --> 03:47:28.720 align:start position:0%
adopted in 30s something States roughly
 
03:47:30.990 --> 03:47:31.000 align:start position:0%
uh they have the ability to convert an
 
03:47:32.870 --> 03:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
existing trust to a unit trust so that's
 
03:47:35.910 --> 03:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
very common um what is somewhat unique
 
03:47:37.950 --> 03:47:37.960 align:start position:0%
uh in maybe a handful of states and
 
03:47:39.590 --> 03:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
we're certainly aware of it in Delaware
 
03:47:40.750 --> 03:47:40.760 align:start position:0%
which is one of the states that we're
 
03:47:43.030 --> 03:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
competing against uh is the ability to
 
03:47:45.389 --> 03:47:45.399 align:start position:0%
have a unit trust at Inception
 
03:47:49.429 --> 03:47:49.439 align:start position:0%
um It's relatively A New Concept because
 
03:47:52.349 --> 03:47:52.359 align:start position:0%
um the whole kind of legal industry
 
03:47:54.510 --> 03:47:54.520 align:start position:0%
around unitrust has been conversion it's
 
03:47:56.349 --> 03:47:56.359 align:start position:0%
taking these old trusts that are used to
 
03:47:58.189 --> 03:47:58.199 align:start position:0%
this kind of clunky income interest and
 
03:48:00.149 --> 03:48:00.159 align:start position:0%
making it more modernized and optimized
 
03:48:02.630 --> 03:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
through a unitrust conversion uh there
 
03:48:06.950 --> 03:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
just hasn't been much uh by way of um uh
 
03:48:09.349 --> 03:48:09.359 align:start position:0%
thought leadership on doing it at
 
03:48:11.630 --> 03:48:11.640 align:start position:0%
Inception and so that's uh we're we're
 
03:48:13.550 --> 03:48:13.560 align:start position:0%
on kind of The Cutting Edge uh in trying
 
03:48:16.070 --> 03:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
to do that but in a way we think is is
 
03:48:17.910 --> 03:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
beneficial to everyone
 
03:48:22.750 --> 03:48:22.760 align:start position:0%
involved and uh if I if I could
 
03:48:28.070 --> 03:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
um does the trust unitrust or not have
 
03:48:34.149 --> 03:48:34.159 align:start position:0%
to be established in the state residence
 
03:48:37.870 --> 03:48:37.880 align:start position:0%
of the donor the the principal no so it
 
03:48:39.790 --> 03:48:39.800 align:start position:0%
has to be it has to be created in New
 
03:48:41.750 --> 03:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and so if you had somebody
 
03:48:44.070 --> 03:48:44.080 align:start position:0%
that was a resident of New York and they
 
03:48:45.710 --> 03:48:45.720 align:start position:0%
wanted to take Advantage they looked
 
03:48:46.870 --> 03:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
around the country and said well which
 
03:48:48.469 --> 03:48:48.479 align:start position:0%
state has the best laws in order for me
 
03:48:50.469 --> 03:48:50.479 align:start position:0%
to achieve what I'm trying to accomplish
 
03:48:53.670 --> 03:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
with my estate plan um they might not be
 
03:48:54.990 --> 03:48:55.000 align:start position:0%
able to do it in New York so they'd have
 
03:48:57.070 --> 03:48:57.080 align:start position:0%
to bring their trust to New Hampshire
 
03:48:59.070 --> 03:48:59.080 align:start position:0%
and that's what we've been trying to do
 
03:49:00.910 --> 03:49:00.920 align:start position:0%
over the last two decades and creating
 
03:49:03.189 --> 03:49:03.199 align:start position:0%
an industry here uh that's created jobs
 
03:49:05.510 --> 03:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
created Revenue to uh uh attract
 
03:49:09.670 --> 03:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
people's trust uh here so is is this
 
03:49:14.229 --> 03:49:14.239 align:start position:0%
playing um the Junior League Delaware
 
03:49:17.389 --> 03:49:17.399 align:start position:0%
game is is that what this is I I don't
 
03:49:19.510 --> 03:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
know what you mean by that Junior League
 
03:49:21.269 --> 03:49:21.279 align:start position:0%
we're trying to be the best uh
 
03:49:22.710 --> 03:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction and this is one of the
 
03:49:24.510 --> 03:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
features that we think will make uh New
 
03:49:27.950 --> 03:49:27.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire attractive to uh outof State
 
03:49:29.590 --> 03:49:29.600 align:start position:0%
grant tours to cite us their trust here
 
03:49:31.189 --> 03:49:31.199 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and then just one last
 
03:49:34.110 --> 03:49:34.120 align:start position:0%
if I have okay and uh do you have any
 
03:49:37.229 --> 03:49:37.239 align:start position:0%
idea of um
 
03:49:37.239 --> 03:49:40.630 align:start position:0%
idea of um
what

03:49:40.630 --> 03:49:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:43.070 --> 03:49:43.080 align:start position:0%
revenue and exactly how that would be
 
03:49:46.710 --> 03:49:46.720 align:start position:0%
measured I have no idea has come to the
 
03:49:49.070 --> 03:49:49.080 align:start position:0%
state um
 
03:49:50.870 --> 03:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
because of
 
03:49:53.389 --> 03:49:53.399 align:start position:0%
this if I may looking at Patrick but
 
03:49:56.110 --> 03:49:56.120 align:start position:0%
I'll be happy um I will be happy to send
 
03:49:58.349 --> 03:49:58.359 align:start position:0%
you a couple of years ago and so it's
 
03:50:00.349 --> 03:50:00.359 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit old but I we have only
 
03:50:02.030 --> 03:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
grown as an industry since but a couple
 
03:50:04.790 --> 03:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
of years ago there was a study committee
 
03:50:07.110 --> 03:50:07.120 align:start position:0%
um kind of attached to a bill that was
 
03:50:09.590 --> 03:50:09.600 align:start position:0%
passed that we we were supportive of and
 
03:50:12.149 --> 03:50:12.159 align:start position:0%
we spent several sessions during during
 
03:50:16.030 --> 03:50:16.040 align:start position:0%
the summer um and I had a economic study
 
03:50:18.590 --> 03:50:18.600 align:start position:0%
uh done uh very conservative economic
 
03:50:20.429 --> 03:50:20.439 align:start position:0%
study the original economic study for
 
03:50:23.349 --> 03:50:23.359 align:start position:0%
trust modernization was a little bit um
 
03:50:25.990 --> 03:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
effusive if you will but uh but I had a
 
03:50:28.389 --> 03:50:28.399 align:start position:0%
very practical economics study done and
 
03:50:32.349 --> 03:50:32.359 align:start position:0%
um there were something like 600 uh jobs
 
03:50:37.269 --> 03:50:37.279 align:start position:0%
uh that are uh connected to the industry
 
03:50:40.990 --> 03:50:41.000 align:start position:0%
um I I'll tell you this for scale when
 
03:50:44.110 --> 03:50:44.120 align:start position:0%
uh trust monitorization began there were
 
03:50:47.070 --> 03:50:47.080 align:start position:0%
probably around around $100 million of
 
03:50:48.870 --> 03:50:48.880 align:start position:0%
trust Assets in New Hampshire and I'll
 
03:50:51.110 --> 03:50:51.120 align:start position:0%
explain why that's important um the
 
03:50:52.630 --> 03:50:52.640 align:start position:0%
banking department will tell you that as
 
03:50:54.870 --> 03:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
at the middle of last year that was $1.3
 
03:50:59.110 --> 03:50:59.120 align:start position:0%
trillion dollar um why that's important
 
03:51:01.750 --> 03:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
is to have a New Hampshire a trust under
 
03:51:05.070 --> 03:51:05.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire laws work uh in the way
 
03:51:06.830 --> 03:51:06.840 align:start position:0%
that wherever the settlers from they
 
03:51:08.950 --> 03:51:08.960 align:start position:0%
want it to work they typically need to
 
03:51:11.910 --> 03:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
be administered in New Hampshire and so
 
03:51:14.790 --> 03:51:14.800 align:start position:0%
that is how we've grown that industry um
 
03:51:18.149 --> 03:51:18.159 align:start position:0%
and there are I think 35 now and growing
 
03:51:20.030 --> 03:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
trust companies chartered in New
 
03:51:22.750 --> 03:51:22.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but the total assets of 1.3
 
03:51:25.950 --> 03:51:25.960 align:start position:0%
trillion is roughly twice South Dakota's
 
03:51:27.870 --> 03:51:27.880 align:start position:0%
which is often thought of as the leading
 
03:51:30.149 --> 03:51:30.159 align:start position:0%
state so I did want to just uh if I
 
03:51:34.070 --> 03:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
might uh address the comment I think
 
03:51:36.870 --> 03:51:36.880 align:start position:0%
Delaware's possibly sliding reputation
 
03:51:39.630 --> 03:51:39.640 align:start position:0%
is not so much in their trust industry
 
03:51:41.469 --> 03:51:41.479 align:start position:0%
as in their sort of
 
03:51:44.910 --> 03:51:44.920 align:start position:0%
LLC we're the LLC State and I I lawyer
 
03:51:46.590 --> 03:51:46.600 align:start position:0%
who works for me mentioned the other day
 
03:51:48.750 --> 03:51:48.760 align:start position:0%
why are people not forming llc's in New
 
03:51:51.030 --> 03:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have much better LLC law
 
03:51:53.429 --> 03:51:53.439 align:start position:0%
than Delaware but I think that that has
 
03:51:54.990 --> 03:51:55.000 align:start position:0%
been you know a thing and the other
 
03:51:56.710 --> 03:51:56.720 align:start position:0%
thing I'll say is these states we
 
03:51:59.590 --> 03:51:59.600 align:start position:0%
compete with we're often I often get
 
03:52:02.070 --> 03:52:02.080 align:start position:0%
calls from the Washington Post or others
 
03:52:03.670 --> 03:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
what's going on there with there's all
 
03:52:05.510 --> 03:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
this you know hidden money and all of
 
03:52:05.520 --> 03:52:06.309 align:start position:0%
this you know hidden money and all of
this

03:52:06.309 --> 03:52:06.319 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:52:08.590 --> 03:52:08.600 align:start position:0%
stuff the last time I spoke with them
 
03:52:10.309 --> 03:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
the first thing they said to me was
 
03:52:12.429 --> 03:52:12.439 align:start position:0%
we've looked at all these the latest one
 
03:52:14.750 --> 03:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
was called Paradise papers and there are
 
03:52:16.870 --> 03:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
no connections to New Hampshire trust
 
03:52:19.830 --> 03:52:19.840 align:start position:0%
companies or New Hampshire Trustees of
 
03:52:21.750 --> 03:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
course I said I could never promise you
 
03:52:23.750 --> 03:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
that would be the case we're not you
 
03:52:26.590 --> 03:52:26.600 align:start position:0%
know keepers of everyone but we've tried
 
03:52:29.790 --> 03:52:29.800 align:start position:0%
to be both Innovative and conservative
 
03:52:33.670 --> 03:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
and so our reputation is solid I would
 
03:52:35.590 --> 03:52:35.600 align:start position:0%
say and and we're sort of often asked
 
03:52:38.510 --> 03:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
why are you not in that group um you
 
03:52:40.910 --> 03:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
know that sort of gets a negative
 
03:52:43.110 --> 03:52:43.120 align:start position:0%
reputation we only want to be famous
 
03:52:45.590 --> 03:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
among professionals who are trying to
 
03:52:47.590 --> 03:52:47.600 align:start position:0%
steer their clients to sort of the best
 
03:52:49.830 --> 03:52:49.840 align:start position:0%
approach and the best uh state to do it
 
03:52:51.950 --> 03:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
in we don't want to be Infamous and then
 
03:52:54.469 --> 03:52:54.479 align:start position:0%
I promise this is my last one so in
 
03:52:57.429 --> 03:52:57.439 align:start position:0%
terms of this very impressive Revenue
 
03:53:02.269 --> 03:53:02.279 align:start position:0%
figure that is revenue that goes to the
 
03:53:04.710 --> 03:53:04.720 align:start position:0%
industry not to the state well that is
 
03:53:07.070 --> 03:53:07.080 align:start position:0%
that is assets which is a kind of a
 
03:53:08.790 --> 03:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
proxy measure of sort of the scale of
 
03:53:10.950 --> 03:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
the industry the revenue that would come
 
03:53:12.590 --> 03:53:12.600 align:start position:0%
to the state would be business profits
 
03:53:15.309 --> 03:53:15.319 align:start position:0%
tax and I'm not privy to uh other
 
03:53:17.910 --> 03:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
taxpayers uh business profits tax but
 
03:53:19.469 --> 03:53:19.479 align:start position:0%
right even if you're not physically
 
03:53:21.149 --> 03:53:21.159 align:start position:0%
located in New Hampshire if you are
 
03:53:23.670 --> 03:53:23.680 align:start position:0%
doing New Hampshire trust administrative
 
03:53:25.469 --> 03:53:25.479 align:start position:0%
work thank you very much for your
 
03:53:27.110 --> 03:53:27.120 align:start position:0%

you so you know I just I just have one
 
03:53:33.750 --> 03:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
other question so this this amendment
 
03:53:35.630 --> 03:53:35.640 align:start position:0%
that you I mean it's not in official
 
03:53:38.110 --> 03:53:38.120 align:start position:0%
form but I'm going to submit um you've
 
03:53:40.510 --> 03:53:40.520 align:start position:0%
gone through this line by line and it's
 
03:53:43.790 --> 03:53:43.800 align:start position:0%
it it's right is that is that what we
 
03:53:45.910 --> 03:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
think so okay all right all right cuz I
 
03:53:48.469 --> 03:53:48.479 align:start position:0%
mean that's uh I how much more I you
 
03:53:50.229 --> 03:53:50.239 align:start position:0%

of time on it we've shown it to a lot of
 
03:53:53.189 --> 03:53:53.199 align:start position:0%
people we do hope it is and we'll

this as an amendment can you send me an
 
03:54:08.429 --> 03:54:08.439 align:start position:0%
email copy of this yes so that I can
 
03:54:10.469 --> 03:54:10.479 align:start position:0%
electronically then forward it to uh

right representative Manos thank you Mr
 
03:54:19.790 --> 03:54:19.800 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you again for taking my
 
03:54:22.349 --> 03:54:22.359 align:start position:0%
questions um so I want to go back to the
 
03:54:24.510 --> 03:54:24.520 align:start position:0%
unitary trust because I'm still puzzling
 
03:54:27.710 --> 03:54:27.720 align:start position:0%
this through so the 3 to
 
03:54:31.550 --> 03:54:31.560 align:start position:0%
5% I is that meant to equal an income
 
03:54:35.110 --> 03:54:35.120 align:start position:0%
stream is that how it's derived and then
 
03:54:38.429 --> 03:54:38.439 align:start position:0%
my qu my my other question
 
03:54:42.790 --> 03:54:42.800 align:start position:0%
is um so would the would the
 
03:54:45.309 --> 03:54:45.319 align:start position:0%
trustee let's say the distribution is
 
03:54:48.269 --> 03:54:48.279 align:start position:0%
made as of December 31st and it and it
 
03:54:51.070 --> 03:54:51.080 align:start position:0%
it's distributed on January
 
03:54:55.389 --> 03:54:55.399 align:start position:0%
1st um would the trustee sell assets
 
03:54:57.750 --> 03:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
that are worth 3 to 5% and then say to
 
03:54:59.429 --> 03:54:59.439 align:start position:0%
the Widow here's your X number of
 
03:55:03.469 --> 03:55:03.479 align:start position:0%
dollars yep or or do does the trustee
 
03:55:05.110 --> 03:55:05.120 align:start position:0%
have to decide I'm going to send you
 
03:55:09.910 --> 03:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
2,000 shares of Nvidia and and is it a
 
03:55:11.990 --> 03:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
distribution of an asset or is it a
 
03:55:13.790 --> 03:55:13.800 align:start position:0%
distribution of cash great question
 
03:55:17.229 --> 03:55:17.239 align:start position:0%
great question yeah so um uh it can be
 
03:55:20.830 --> 03:55:20.840 align:start position:0%
either uh and usually the beneficiary uh
 
03:55:23.389 --> 03:55:23.399 align:start position:0%
is the one that informs what they want
 
03:55:26.590 --> 03:55:26.600 align:start position:0%
the the trustee um the obligation there
 
03:55:29.229 --> 03:55:29.239 align:start position:0%
is just to distribute value uh and so if
 
03:55:31.349 --> 03:55:31.359 align:start position:0%
the whether that comes in the form of a
 
03:55:34.990 --> 03:55:35.000 align:start position:0%
post sale proceeds and cash uh or if it
 
03:55:37.030 --> 03:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
comes in the form of a distribution in
 
03:55:39.149 --> 03:55:39.159 align:start position:0%
kind uh the trustee would be cloaked
 
03:55:41.469 --> 03:55:41.479 align:start position:0%
with the power to do either but largely
 
03:55:45.389 --> 03:55:45.399 align:start position:0%
it would be um uh uh in consultation
 
03:55:46.670 --> 03:55:46.680 align:start position:0%
with the beneficiary to figure out what
 
03:55:49.910 --> 03:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
they what they want the from a tax
 
03:55:54.269 --> 03:55:54.279 align:start position:0%
perspective um uh on capital gain when
 
03:55:56.389 --> 03:55:56.399 align:start position:0%
selling an asset whether it's sold
 
03:55:59.670 --> 03:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
within the trust or sold uh in the hands
 
03:56:00.510 --> 03:56:00.520 align:start position:0%
of the
 
03:56:03.070 --> 03:56:03.080 align:start position:0%
beneficiary um uh from the federal
 
03:56:04.550 --> 03:56:04.560 align:start position:0%
perspective there would be a non-issue
 
03:56:06.510 --> 03:56:06.520 align:start position:0%
it's long-term capital gain is 20%
 
03:56:09.149 --> 03:56:09.159 align:start position:0%
short-term capital gain is the same um
 
03:56:11.670 --> 03:56:11.680 align:start position:0%
um regardless where there could be a
 
03:56:14.870 --> 03:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
distinction H is uh
 
03:56:18.590 --> 03:56:18.600 align:start position:0%
if you lived in a high tax jurisdiction
 
03:56:21.469 --> 03:56:21.479 align:start position:0%
like California or New York or even now
 
03:56:23.469 --> 03:56:23.479 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts uh and the trust is in New
 
03:56:25.110 --> 03:56:25.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you might be better off
 
03:56:26.309 --> 03:56:26.319 align:start position:0%
selling it in New Hampshire because
 
03:56:28.189 --> 03:56:28.199 align:start position:0%
there's no income tax capital gains tax
 
03:56:30.830 --> 03:56:30.840 align:start position:0%
here and then Distributing the proceeds
 
03:56:33.149 --> 03:56:33.159 align:start position:0%
um on a taxfree basis so there could be
 
03:56:35.349 --> 03:56:35.359 align:start position:0%
some optimization around state taxes
 
03:56:37.229 --> 03:56:37.239 align:start position:0%
that would inform one way or the other
 
03:56:39.830 --> 03:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
but there's no rigid requirement either
 
03:56:43.070 --> 03:56:43.080 align:start position:0%
way um and I'm sorry I forgot the first
 
03:56:45.830 --> 03:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
question first part of that that the 3
 
03:56:50.469 --> 03:56:50.479 align:start position:0%
to 5% is yes yeah yeah so the 3 to 5% so
 
03:56:52.670 --> 03:56:52.680 align:start position:0%
again with that is um I'll give you a
 
03:56:53.910 --> 03:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
good example of kind of how this plays
 
03:56:57.189 --> 03:56:57.199 align:start position:0%
out um if I'm if I'm trying to Define
 
03:56:59.149 --> 03:56:59.159 align:start position:0%
what I want to leave to my spouse and
 
03:57:01.030 --> 03:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
qualify that trust for the unlimited
 
03:57:04.469 --> 03:57:04.479 align:start position:0%
meril deduction the IRS has said uh at a
 
03:57:06.790 --> 03:57:06.800 align:start position:0%
at that the spouse has to have an income
 
03:57:08.630 --> 03:57:08.640 align:start position:0%
interest they have to mandatorily be
 
03:57:10.149 --> 03:57:10.159 align:start position:0%
required to receive distributions of
 
03:57:12.429 --> 03:57:12.439 align:start position:0%
income and they're okay having that be
 
03:57:15.790 --> 03:57:15.800 align:start position:0%
defined as 3 to 5% % of the trust but if
 
03:57:18.510 --> 03:57:18.520 align:start position:0%
I'm if I'm the spouse and I say I'm the
 
03:57:20.550 --> 03:57:20.560 align:start position:0%
deceased spouse I say I wanted to have
 
03:57:23.349 --> 03:57:23.359 align:start position:0%
my spouse get um the income interest to
 
03:57:25.070 --> 03:57:25.080 align:start position:0%
qualify it for the maril deduction 3 to
 
03:57:28.510 --> 03:57:28.520 align:start position:0%
5 percent but in addition to that I want
 
03:57:31.189 --> 03:57:31.199 align:start position:0%
um an independent truste to be able to
 
03:57:32.990 --> 03:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
give distributions to my spouse in
 
03:57:36.189 --> 03:57:36.199 align:start position:0%
excess of that totally fine totally fine
 
03:57:38.229 --> 03:57:38.239 align:start position:0%
uh you could even say on on a much less
 
03:57:41.670 --> 03:57:41.680 align:start position:0%
scale um I want my spouse to receive
 
03:57:43.870 --> 03:57:43.880 align:start position:0%
three to 5% and my spouse is the bet is
 
03:57:45.950 --> 03:57:45.960 align:start position:0%
the trustee and she or he can give as
 
03:57:47.469 --> 03:57:47.479 align:start position:0%
much as they want to themselves on top
 
03:57:51.030 --> 03:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
of that um uh so there's there's
 
03:57:53.830 --> 03:57:53.840 align:start position:0%
complete flexibility to do more uh but
 
03:57:56.229 --> 03:57:56.239 align:start position:0%
at a minimum in order to qualify the
 
03:57:59.149 --> 03:57:59.159 align:start position:0%
trust for the marit deduction 3 to 5% is
 
03:57:59.159 --> 03:58:00.590 align:start position:0%
trust for the marit deduction 3 to 5% is
the

03:58:00.590 --> 03:58:00.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:58:04.870 --> 03:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
floor yes represent thank you um the
 
03:58:07.630 --> 03:58:07.640 align:start position:0%
other question I was um wondering about
 
03:58:09.590 --> 03:58:09.600 align:start position:0%
do the REM remainder beneficiaries let's
 
03:58:11.950 --> 03:58:11.960 align:start position:0%
say it's the Nvidia stock and and we
 
03:58:16.149 --> 03:58:16.159 align:start position:0%
send the the spouse 20 shares do the
 
03:58:18.070 --> 03:58:18.080 align:start position:0%
remainder beneficiaries have any right
 
03:58:20.750 --> 03:58:20.760 align:start position:0%
to say no don't send her the Nvidia I I
 
03:58:23.590 --> 03:58:23.600 align:start position:0%
want you to send her the Amazon nope no
 
03:58:23.600 --> 03:58:25.870 align:start position:0%
want you to send her the Amazon nope no
no

03:58:25.870 --> 03:58:25.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:28.910 --> 03:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
power and just can I just ask one follow
 
03:58:32.429 --> 03:58:32.439 align:start position:0%
question so the if the trust you know
 
03:58:34.990 --> 03:58:35.000 align:start position:0%
uses to say 3 to 5% to the what would
 
03:58:37.149 --> 03:58:37.159 align:start position:0%
have been the income beneficiary um and
 
03:58:40.349 --> 03:58:40.359 align:start position:0%
it and that amount is to be
 
03:58:44.590 --> 03:58:44.600 align:start position:0%
paid on a yearly basis let's say so is
 
03:58:46.469 --> 03:58:46.479 align:start position:0%
so the first year the first year the
 
03:58:48.349 --> 03:58:48.359 align:start position:0%
trust is worth the million dollars let's
 
03:58:52.389 --> 03:58:52.399 align:start position:0%
say and they pay three to 5% the first
 
03:58:54.229 --> 03:58:54.239 align:start position:0%
and then at the end of the second year
 
03:58:57.630 --> 03:58:57.640 align:start position:0%
do you you revalue the trust as of that
 
03:59:00.349 --> 03:59:00.359 align:start position:0%
year so if it's gone up to a million5
 
03:59:02.950 --> 03:59:02.960 align:start position:0%
then it's 3% of a million5 yeah exactly
 
03:59:06.590 --> 03:59:06.600 align:start position:0%
so so um for example for this year uh
 
03:59:08.590 --> 03:59:08.600 align:start position:0%
you would look at December 31st value of
 
03:59:10.830 --> 03:59:10.840 align:start position:0%
last year and then the grantor could
 
03:59:13.070 --> 03:59:13.080 align:start position:0%
Define how frequently distribution
 
03:59:15.030 --> 03:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
should be made so let's say that the the
 
03:59:18.149 --> 03:59:18.159 align:start position:0%
percentage is four 4% and my math is
 
03:59:19.750 --> 03:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
terrible let's just assume that as of
 
03:59:22.510 --> 03:59:22.520 align:start position:0%
December 31st of last year 4% was
 
03:59:25.630 --> 03:59:25.640 align:start position:0%
$100,000 just hypothetically um the
 
03:59:29.030 --> 03:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
grantor could say I want that to be made
 
03:59:30.790 --> 03:59:30.800 align:start position:0%
within the first 15 days of the year so
 
03:59:32.510 --> 03:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
the spouse gets that money immediately
 
03:59:34.189 --> 03:59:34.199 align:start position:0%
or the grantor could say I want that to
 
03:59:36.149 --> 03:59:36.159 align:start position:0%
be paid monthly so you take that 100,000
 
03:59:37.830 --> 03:59:37.840 align:start position:0%
divide it by 12 and it's paid monthly
 
03:59:39.590 --> 03:59:39.600 align:start position:0%
you could do it quarterly you could do
 
03:59:42.149 --> 03:59:42.159 align:start position:0%
it semiannually you can Define the
 
03:59:44.590 --> 03:59:44.600 align:start position:0%
frequency but the value is as of
 
03:59:47.189 --> 03:59:47.199 align:start position:0%
December 31st the prior year okay all
 
03:59:49.670 --> 03:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
right other questions for yes
 
03:59:51.149 --> 03:59:51.159 align:start position:0%
representative walls thank you chairman
 
03:59:54.910 --> 03:59:54.920 align:start position:0%
Lyn um under that example uh the this
 
03:59:56.710 --> 03:59:56.720 align:start position:0%
establishment of the unitrust actually
 
03:59:58.590 --> 03:59:58.600 align:start position:0%
strikes a balance between the remainder
 
04:00:01.309 --> 04:00:01.319 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries and the current income
 
04:00:03.510 --> 04:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries while still
 
04:00:08.149 --> 04:00:08.159 align:start position:0%
preserving principle by roughly having
 
04:00:09.670 --> 04:00:09.680 align:start position:0%
that is dividing in two the
 
04:00:12.950 --> 04:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
distributions on an annual basis so the
 
04:00:14.630 --> 04:00:14.640 align:start position:0%
spouse would get a pro half of the
 
04:00:16.229 --> 04:00:16.239 align:start position:0%
distributions the other half would
 
04:00:18.910 --> 04:00:18.920 align:start position:0%
remain so that the uh principal would
 
04:00:20.309 --> 04:00:20.319 align:start position:0%
grow further for the remainder
 
04:00:21.630 --> 04:00:21.640 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries is would that be an
 
04:00:23.550 --> 04:00:23.560 align:start position:0%
accurate assessment yeah the the only
 
04:00:26.030 --> 04:00:26.040 align:start position:0%
the only um copy I'd say to that is if
 
04:00:29.550 --> 04:00:29.560 align:start position:0%
the if the interest is 4% um that's what
 
04:00:31.189 --> 04:00:31.199 align:start position:0%
they get there's no like half this half
 
04:00:32.870 --> 04:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
that just that's what they get and and
 
04:00:36.189 --> 04:00:36.199 align:start position:0%
the growth of this of the portfolio is
 
04:00:38.030 --> 04:00:38.040 align:start position:0%
inuring not just to your point not just
 
04:00:39.229 --> 04:00:39.239 align:start position:0%
to the remainder beneficiaries who are
 
04:00:40.830 --> 04:00:40.840 align:start position:0%
getting a much bigger trust but in the
 
04:00:43.349 --> 04:00:43.359 align:start position:0%
next year the spouse in that example is
 
04:00:44.710 --> 04:00:44.720 align:start position:0%
going to get more
 
04:00:47.229 --> 04:00:47.239 align:start position:0%
uh than if they were subject to you know
 
04:00:50.389 --> 04:00:50.399 align:start position:0%
kind of a gradual grind of of of
 
04:00:52.030 --> 04:00:52.040 align:start position:0%
dividend payments yes and that's going
 
04:00:54.670 --> 04:00:54.680 align:start position:0%
to fluctuate because past uh gains are
 
04:00:55.790 --> 04:00:55.800 align:start position:0%
not going to be indicative future
 
04:00:58.309 --> 04:00:58.319 align:start position:0%
performance as we all
 
04:01:00.429 --> 04:01:00.439 align:start position:0%
know right interesting any other
 
04:01:03.030 --> 04:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
questions for these Witnesses all right
 
04:01:04.710 --> 04:01:04.720 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much appreciate
 
04:01:06.429 --> 04:01:06.439 align:start position:0%
thank you so much thank you thank you
 
04:01:07.790 --> 04:01:07.800 align:start position:0%
all right is there anyone else who
 
04:01:12.389 --> 04:01:12.399 align:start position:0%
wishes to testify on uh Senate Bill
 
04:01:15.030 --> 04:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
435 right seeing none I'm going to close
 
04:01:18.030 --> 04:01:18.040 align:start position:0%
the hearing on sen Bill
 
04:01:21.149 --> 04:01:21.159 align:start position:0%
435 and um I think that's that's it for
 
04:01:24.229 --> 04:01:24.239 align:start position:0%
us uh you know what can I um so we only
 
04:01:26.149 --> 04:01:26.159 align:start position:0%
have we don't have all the bills in yet
 
04:01:28.710 --> 04:01:28.720 align:start position:0%
but it looks like we might have two
 
04:01:31.070 --> 04:01:31.080 align:start position:0%
other bills but I don't my sense is
 
04:01:33.550 --> 04:01:33.560 align:start position:0%
let's just put it off for and does it
 
04:01:35.630 --> 04:01:35.640 align:start position:0%
make the only other question is this
 
04:01:37.870 --> 04:01:37.880 align:start position:0%
does it make any sense to come in next
 
04:01:40.309 --> 04:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
week to exact what we have or just wait
 
04:01:42.269 --> 04:01:42.279 align:start position:0%
wait wait that's fine I'm I'm fine with
 
04:01:44.910 --> 04:01:44.920 align:start position:0%
that I we could use a week off
 
04:01:54.229 --> 04:01:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:57.510 --> 04:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
right that's it well what does
