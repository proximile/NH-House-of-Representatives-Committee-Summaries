the button um to speak into the

but uh I'm looking forward uh to this
 
00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
year I think we've got um a a good
 
00:14:20.069 --> 00:14:20.079 align:start position:0%
committee um and there's a lot we can
 
00:14:23.389 --> 00:14:23.399 align:start position:0%
accomplish we'll have a lot of bills um
 
00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
as uh most everybody knows um the
 
00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
committee was split into two
 
00:14:33.389 --> 00:14:33.399 align:start position:0%
um this year um in the past several
 
00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
terms we have had um a huge number of
 
00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:39.240 align:start position:0%
bills to try and get through over a
 
00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
hundred house bills each year um so we
 
00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:45.240 align:start position:0%
thought it was best to divide uh the
 
00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:50.920 align:start position:0%
committee um we'll work work through um
 
00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:52.430 align:start position:0%
committee um we'll work work through um
the

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh Direction bills are sent um by
 
00:15:00.269 --> 00:15:00.279 align:start position:0%
leadership um you know uh should it go
 
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
to funding or should it go to policy
 
00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
Administration um so we'll work through
 
00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
that this year we've we've already had
 
00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
three bills that we've vacated and sent
 
00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:14.240 align:start position:0%
to um uh the other committee um we'll
 
00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:15.680 align:start position:0%
see if maybe there's a few more we can
 
00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
get rid of along the way um but I expect
 
00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:20.920 align:start position:0%
we'll have the majority of the bills um
 
00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:25.720 align:start position:0%
we have 36 so far um only three early
 
00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
bills um but we'll make a good progress
 
00:15:32.509 --> 00:15:32.519 align:start position:0%
getting through them and um more to come
 
00:15:37.629 --> 00:15:37.639 align:start position:0%
I I know um I I think that you know one
 
00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:39.560 align:start position:0%
of the things I wanted to start off with
 
00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:46.360 align:start position:0%
was um uh the committee um and that we
 
00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
need to uh be civil and have respect for
 
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
each other uh and professionalism you
 
00:15:55.189 --> 00:15:55.199 align:start position:0%

education committee you know that's
 
00:15:59.470 --> 00:15:59.480 align:start position:0%

in terms of
 
00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
supplies um so you know be looking for a
 
00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
volunteer for that assignment and you
 
00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:24.440 align:start position:0%
know we'll set up a little um a cup you
 
00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:26.120 align:start position:0%
know so maybe you throw it a doar in or
 
00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:28.640 align:start position:0%
something when you get a cup of coffee
 
00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:29.870 align:start position:0%
something when you get a cup of coffee
uh

00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:35.480 align:start position:0%
or te or whatever um so uh that's um an
 
00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
important uh important thing for many of
 
00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
us um and in terms of that um uh they uh
 
00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
say no food or drink um in the committee
 
00:18:52.149 --> 00:18:52.159 align:start position:0%
room um you know water is fine coffee is
 
00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:55.960 align:start position:0%
fine um I know I would certainly vote
 
00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
for that and um food uh probably not
 
00:19:03.669 --> 00:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
during hearings and exact session but
 
00:19:05.549 --> 00:19:05.559 align:start position:0%
you know a few of us might you know have
 
00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:08.440 align:start position:0%
lunch here um in the room uh especially
 
00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:11.720 align:start position:0%
when we're uh um pressed for
 
00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:15.830 align:start position:0%
when we're uh um pressed for
time

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:19.789 --> 00:19:19.799 align:start position:0%
um some of the other things um the way
 
00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
we want to do things in the um in the
 
00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:29.240 align:start position:0%
committee um is that uh um as I said
 
00:19:32.549 --> 00:19:32.559 align:start position:0%
um representative is the uh name that we
 
00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
should use for everybody um our goal is
 
00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:39.720 align:start position:0%
to start our hearings on time and our
 
00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
exec sessions on time um we'll try and
 
00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
get information out um to everybody um
 
00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:48.440 align:start position:0%
as soon as we can about um schedules for
 
00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
the upcoming um week or two um uh
 
00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:54.520 align:start position:0%
representive Cornell has the schedule
 
00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:57.400 align:start position:0%
for next week and um we'll be passing it
 
00:19:59.950 --> 00:19:59.960 align:start position:0%
around to uh our side of the aisle as
 
00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:03.240 align:start position:0%
well um since Monday is a holiday next
 
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
week um we will meet on Wednesday and
 
00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
Thursday uh our typical meeting days
 
00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:11.320 align:start position:0%
will be Monday and
 
00:20:13.909 --> 00:20:13.919 align:start position:0%
Wednesday um the other education
 
00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:16.280 align:start position:0%
committee will meet Tuesday and Friday
 
00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:20.600 align:start position:0%
and Thursday will be an open day um when
 
00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:23.320 align:start position:0%
there isn't session for uh who wants to
 
00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
be the first to schedule the
 
00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:29.480 align:start position:0%
room um so um
 
00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:32.360 align:start position:0%
so it will be Wednesday and Thursday
 
00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
next week um in terms of cell phones and
 
00:20:40.149 --> 00:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
laptops um I know that some PE I'm sorry
 
00:20:42.029 --> 00:20:42.039 align:start position:0%
go ahead represent Sally thank you so
 
00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:43.480 align:start position:0%
much um do you know what time we'll be
 
00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
starting on those days just so I can
 
00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:47.960 align:start position:0%
block it yeah um it might vary I think
 
00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
next Wednesday we'll start at 9:30 and
 
00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
on Thursday at 10: but hopefully more
 
00:20:59.430 --> 00:20:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
um I know some people have ways to
 
00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:04.310 align:start position:0%
um I know some people have ways to
travel

00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
travel
 
00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
um laptops and cell phones I know some
 
00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:13.240 align:start position:0%
people like to take notes maybe on uh
 
00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:15.720 align:start position:0%
their laptop um rather than uh
 
00:21:19.269 --> 00:21:19.279 align:start position:0%
handwright notes so that's fine um I
 
00:21:22.549 --> 00:21:22.559 align:start position:0%
would just uh discourage um doing
 
00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
searching and so forth uh uh especially
 
00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
during hearings you want to pay
 
00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:30.440 align:start position:0%
attention uh to the test testimony um
 
00:21:32.789 --> 00:21:32.799 align:start position:0%
like with likewise with cell phones to
 
00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:36.760 align:start position:0%
minimize um use of cell phones um you
 
00:21:39.269 --> 00:21:39.279 align:start position:0%
know I think is um proper
 
00:21:39.279 --> 00:21:42.149 align:start position:0%
know I think is um proper
practice

00:21:42.149 --> 00:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
practice
 
00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:47.240 align:start position:0%
um see what else um public
 
00:21:51.029 --> 00:21:51.039 align:start position:0%
hearings um we'll try and start them on
 
00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:55.880 align:start position:0%
time um it's always a challenge uh to uh
 
00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
anticipate the time the hearing is going
 
00:21:59.149 --> 00:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
to take
 
00:22:03.029 --> 00:22:03.039 align:start position:0%
um but um we won't start hearings early
 
00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
um they'll hopefully be on time um but I
 
00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
I'm sure there'll be times when a
 
00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
hearing will run late and we'll have to
 
00:22:13.149 --> 00:22:13.159 align:start position:0%
uh have a late start to a
 
00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
hearing um and uh one thing in terms of
 
00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:20.840 align:start position:0%
the hearings uh we want to respect the
 
00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
people who are
 
00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:24.440 align:start position:0%
testifying um the purpose of the hearing
 
00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:27.640 align:start position:0%
is to get testimony from people uh to
 
00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:30.760 align:start position:0%
listen and ask uh questions so we know
 
00:22:35.269 --> 00:22:35.279 align:start position:0%
um what their Viewpoint is um but uh not
 
00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
debate with people are who are
 
00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
testifying um I'm sure we'll be doing
 
00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
enough debating in our exact sessions um
 
00:22:45.269 --> 00:22:45.279 align:start position:0%
to cover
 
00:22:45.279 --> 00:22:46.789 align:start position:0%
to cover
that

00:22:46.789 --> 00:22:46.799 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:51.080 align:start position:0%
um excuse me Mr chairman Mr Excuse me
 
00:22:52.909 --> 00:22:52.919 align:start position:0%
along those same lines for those of us
 
00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
who have U LED such boring lives at
 
00:22:58.990 --> 00:22:59.000 align:start position:0%
times that we've actually watched C-SPAN
 
00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
and uh committee meetings one major
 
00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:04.120 align:start position:0%
difference between the New Hampshire
 
00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:08.600 align:start position:0%
house and uh Congress is that um when we
 
00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
question someone who is giving testimony
 
00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:13.480 align:start position:0%
uh we can only ask one question we do
 
00:23:16.669 --> 00:23:16.679 align:start position:0%
not have five minutes uh each to uh
 
00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
engage in a back and forth with uh W
 
00:23:21.909 --> 00:23:21.919 align:start position:0%
with a witness and if we wish to uh
 
00:23:24.029 --> 00:23:24.039 align:start position:0%
follow up with a question we need to ask
 
00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
the chair if we may follow up so that
 
00:23:28.789 --> 00:23:28.799 align:start position:0%
for the benefit of the newcomers one
 
00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
question and then you have to ask uh for
 
00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
permission to follow if you'd like so we
 
00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:35.400 align:start position:0%
cannot engage in colloques here or
 
00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
anything of the sort just one at a time
 
00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:40.440 align:start position:0%
thank you right yes and um yeah
 
00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:42.760 align:start position:0%
everything comes through the chair um
 
00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:46.840 align:start position:0%
request to uh ask questions um of people
 
00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:48.320 align:start position:0%
testifying it all comes through the
 
00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:50.840 align:start position:0%
chair and then a follow-up question if
 
00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:53.360 align:start position:0%
you want as representa Terry pointed out
 
00:23:57.990 --> 00:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
thank you um for those uh freshman
 
00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.310 align:start position:0%
thank you um for those uh freshman
members

00:23:59.310 --> 00:23:59.320 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:24:02.149 --> 00:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
um the way it works is that there are
 
00:24:04.909 --> 00:24:04.919 align:start position:0%
pink cards uh for people who want to
 
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
testify they sign up with um uh their
 
00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
name and um whether they oppose or
 
00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:16.600 align:start position:0%
support and an uh approximate time that
 
00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:19.320 align:start position:0%
they want to speak um there might be
 
00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:21.720 align:start position:0%
sometimes um if we have a very busy
 
00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
schedule and a lot of people uh to
 
00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
testify um there might be um uh times
 
00:24:32.549 --> 00:24:32.559 align:start position:0%
uh set set up um by the chair uh for
 
00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
people testifying um but uh hopefully um
 
00:24:41.029 --> 00:24:41.039 align:start position:0%
that will uh not be uh too common U we
 
00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
want to hear uh all that people have to
 
00:24:46.789 --> 00:24:46.799 align:start position:0%
say and encourage people to uh provide
 
00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
West testimony um for our clerk um
 
00:24:53.149 --> 00:24:53.159 align:start position:0%
representative Margaret dra is our Clerk
 
00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
and she is in uh clerk training uh this
 
00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:02.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:06.909 --> 00:25:06.919 align:start position:0%
um uh one one thing also to point out um
 
00:25:11.269 --> 00:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
there might be a time or two um when the
 
00:25:14.789 --> 00:25:14.799 align:start position:0%
governor might come in uh to the room um
 
00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
we have had uh Governor uh come in to
 
00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
testify in the past on a couple of
 
00:25:23.669 --> 00:25:23.679 align:start position:0%
occasions um if the governor ever uh
 
00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
does come in um we would all stand um in
 
00:25:28.549 --> 00:25:28.559 align:start position:0%
respect for the governor when when they
 
00:25:28.559 --> 00:25:32.389 align:start position:0%
respect for the governor when when they
come

00:25:32.389 --> 00:25:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:34.840 align:start position:0%
in let's see
 
00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:39.320 align:start position:0%
subcommittees um there might be U bills
 
00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:41.960 align:start position:0%
uh that we want to delve into a little
 
00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:45.320 align:start position:0%
deeper um we didn't always have the time
 
00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
to do that uh the past couple of terms
 
00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
because of the crush of the number of
 
00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
bills um so um there might be
 
00:25:57.870 --> 00:25:57.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittees um appointed um to uh look
 
00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
for fur into uh
 
00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
legislation um and uh there would be a
 
00:26:06.789 --> 00:26:06.799 align:start position:0%
number of people from uh both sides uh
 
00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
appointed to the subcommittee and then
 
00:26:12.269 --> 00:26:12.279 align:start position:0%
subcommittee will report back to
 
00:26:18.389 --> 00:26:18.399 align:start position:0%
us um in executive sessions um uh that's
 
00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
where there uh can be some debate and we
 
00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
we know that we'll have some uh Hot
 
00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
Topics um coming before the committee um
 
00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:31.720 align:start position:0%
this year and every year so we just want
 
00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:34.760 align:start position:0%
to try and um as I said be respectful of
 
00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
everybody and not let emotions uh rule
 
00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:39.710 align:start position:0%
everybody and not let emotions uh rule
the

00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:39.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:41.510 align:start position:0%
the
day

00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
day
 
00:26:46.549 --> 00:26:46.559 align:start position:0%
um this being the first year of the term
 
00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
um there are several motions we can make
 
00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:52.360 align:start position:0%
in EXA session for newcomers there's the
 
00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
standard ought to pass
 
00:26:58.789 --> 00:26:58.799 align:start position:0%
OTP in expedient to legislate I
 
00:27:02.789 --> 00:27:02.799 align:start position:0%
itl um or we can retain
 
00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:06.440 align:start position:0%
bills um if we want to do more work on
 
00:27:09.669 --> 00:27:09.679 align:start position:0%
the bill um we can retain the bill in
 
00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
the committee um and have subcommittee
 
00:27:14.549 --> 00:27:14.559 align:start position:0%
or a committee of the whole to address
 
00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:17.960 align:start position:0%
that bill and work on it um over the
 
00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:24.360 align:start position:0%
course of the um spring and uh fall um
 
00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:28.240 align:start position:0%
will take uh um or the house takes off
 
00:27:31.549 --> 00:27:31.559 align:start position:0%
usually July or August um when we don't
 
00:27:35.149 --> 00:27:35.159 align:start position:0%
want to meet but um so retaining a bill
 
00:27:38.549 --> 00:27:38.559 align:start position:0%
is a possible uh motion as well and then
 
00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:42.440 align:start position:0%
we would report back um in um in the
 
00:27:45.669 --> 00:27:45.679 align:start position:0%
fall as to whether we want to uh see
 
00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:49.240 align:start position:0%
that uh legislation go forward um and
 
00:27:52.149 --> 00:27:52.159 align:start position:0%
there can be worked on on amendments uh
 
00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
during that period
 
00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:56.190 align:start position:0%
during that period
also

00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:56.200 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
um the outcome of our exec sessions are
 
00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:02.840 align:start position:0%
um re
 
00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
reports um or blurbs as we used to call
 
00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
them that's not in favor these days but
 
00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
I I still fall back to that um and these
 
00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
reports would be U from the majority and
 
00:28:23.269 --> 00:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
uh minority uh positions um if so
 
00:28:23.279 --> 00:28:25.509 align:start position:0%
uh minority uh positions um if so
desired

00:28:25.509 --> 00:28:25.519 align:start position:0%
desired
 
00:28:31.389 --> 00:28:31.399 align:start position:0%
um the um the mo the reports um can be
 
00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:33.720 align:start position:0%
made and often are made by the person
 
00:28:36.269 --> 00:28:36.279 align:start position:0%
who makes the motion um but that's
 
00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:40.480 align:start position:0%
dependent upon um the leader of each um
 
00:28:43.549 --> 00:28:43.559 align:start position:0%
minority or majority as to who does the
 
00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
report um but uh I'm sure there will be
 
00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:50.120 align:start position:0%
times um when we'll want to
 
00:28:55.029 --> 00:28:55.039 align:start position:0%
caucus um and uh it's fine to uh for
 
00:28:58.190 --> 00:28:58.200 align:start position:0%
anyone to ask for a caucus during an
 
00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
exec session um if there's something
 
00:29:03.549 --> 00:29:03.559 align:start position:0%
that comes up that they want to discuss
 
00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:06.760 align:start position:0%
with uh with their caucus so um don't
 
00:29:08.549 --> 00:29:08.559 align:start position:0%
hesitate to do
 
00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
that um the reports um should be um the
 
00:29:18.389 --> 00:29:18.399 align:start position:0%
position and not an
 
00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
opinion um it's not I I believe or I
 
00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
feel um more in the order of the
 
00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
majority or the minority believes that
 
00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:28.840 align:start position:0%
such and such
 
00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
um reports would get turned in
 
00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:35.640 align:start position:0%
um sometimes there might be a quick
 
00:29:37.389 --> 00:29:37.399 align:start position:0%
turnaround in terms of when we need a
 
00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
report from you um uh but the uh report
 
00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:46.120 align:start position:0%
would go to your um your chairman or
 
00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:49.240 align:start position:0%
your ranking member um we'll have a list
 
00:29:51.669 --> 00:29:51.679 align:start position:0%
of the reports that are due and so we
 
00:29:54.029 --> 00:29:54.039 align:start position:0%
can keep track and make sure that we we
 
00:29:58.909 --> 00:29:58.919 align:start position:0%
get them all in a timely fashion um I
 
00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
uh hesitate to ask for reports uh the
 
00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
same day that we um
 
00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
execel um so I I doubt that I'll be uh
 
00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
doing that um at any point um but if
 
00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:14.840 align:start position:0%
there are any questions about the
 
00:30:18.909 --> 00:30:18.919 align:start position:0%
reports or uh report uh writing um see
 
00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:21.880 align:start position:0%
your ranking member or you know uh chair
 
00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
or vice chair um about
 
00:30:28.789 --> 00:30:28.799 align:start position:0%
that uh because uh they are really
 
00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
um what influences people on house
 
00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
floor um and go into the permanent
 
00:30:40.509 --> 00:30:40.519 align:start position:0%
record as um uh if anyone's looking in
 
00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
the future about uh legislation and
 
00:30:46.509 --> 00:30:46.519 align:start position:0%
intent and so forth um the reports are
 
00:30:50.190 --> 00:30:50.200 align:start position:0%
uh key uh in that that
 
00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:54.310 align:start position:0%
uh key uh in that that
area

00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:59.480 --> 00:30:59.490 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:00.629 align:start position:0%
 
[Applause]

00:31:00.629 --> 00:31:00.639 align:start position:0%
[Applause]
 
00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:05.200 align:start position:0%
um also um one option U me uh mentioned
 
00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:08.120 align:start position:0%
uh for the new members um is the consent
 
00:31:12.190 --> 00:31:12.200 align:start position:0%
calendar um there will be times um when
 
00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
um we all all 18 of us agree um so um we
 
00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:23.720 align:start position:0%
will ask um if consent is uh uh is okay
 
00:31:26.549 --> 00:31:26.559 align:start position:0%
to be put on the consent calendar and
 
00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
then there's just one vote in the house
 
00:31:30.909 --> 00:31:30.919 align:start position:0%
on all the bills on the consent calendar
 
00:31:34.629 --> 00:31:34.639 align:start position:0%
but we did have uh quite a number of um
 
00:31:37.669 --> 00:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
times last year when we had uh a
 
00:31:40.509 --> 00:31:40.519 align:start position:0%
considerable number of bills on the uh
 
00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
consent calendar um so it's it's nice
 
00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
when we can uh all come to a to
 
00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:50.440 align:start position:0%
agreement on a piece of
 
00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:54.470 align:start position:0%
agreement on a piece of
legislation

00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:57.950 --> 00:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
um let's see is there anything else any
 
00:31:59.830 --> 00:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
anyone have any questions or things that
 
00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
they wanted to uh bring up um represent
 
00:32:05.669 --> 00:32:05.679 align:start position:0%
yeah Representative no
 
00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
Noble I just
 
00:32:10.269 --> 00:32:10.279 align:start position:0%
um sometimes we can have hearings that
 
00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:13.960 align:start position:0%
go like pretty long so don't feel shy
 
00:32:18.509 --> 00:32:18.519 align:start position:0%
about getting up to take a break
 
00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
um we just I would wait until the
 
00:32:24.669 --> 00:32:24.679 align:start position:0%
Witnesses are going to switch and then
 
00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:27.200 align:start position:0%
and then walk out as as there's a switch
 
00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:29.240 align:start position:0%
and then act come back to your seat as
 
00:32:30.389 --> 00:32:30.399 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
00:32:34.629 --> 00:32:34.639 align:start position:0%
switch and hearings are not mandatory
 
00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
attendance there'll be um times when you
 
00:32:40.669 --> 00:32:40.679 align:start position:0%
have to go attend to another uh hearing
 
00:32:43.669 --> 00:32:43.679 align:start position:0%
or want to see another hearing um or
 
00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:47.240 align:start position:0%
can't make it in on a day um when um we
 
00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
have hearings um so that's fine we can
 
00:32:54.909 --> 00:32:54.919 align:start position:0%
always watch a video of of the uh of the
 
00:32:59.310 --> 00:32:59.320 align:start position:0%
day um if we so desire um but for exact
 
00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:03.720 align:start position:0%
sessions um it's different um because we
 
00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
want um a Full Slate of the committee to
 
00:33:11.789 --> 00:33:11.799 align:start position:0%
be here to to testify if it all to vote
 
00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
on a legislation if it all possible um
 
00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
the standard that was put into place and
 
00:33:20.629 --> 00:33:20.639 align:start position:0%
continues is that if you cannot make it
 
00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
in for an executive session
 
00:33:29.149 --> 00:33:29.159 align:start position:0%
day uh to contact uh ranking member or
 
00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
um Vice chair or chair the day before so
 
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
that we can arrange for a substitute uh
 
00:33:38.590 --> 00:33:38.600 align:start position:0%
to sit in your
 
00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
place um that's uh very important and um
 
00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:45.200 align:start position:0%
there are going to be those times that
 
00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
come up and um uh we um the office each
 
00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
office will work to get substitutes for
 
00:33:57.430 --> 00:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
us represent s thank you so much um on
 
00:33:59.470 --> 00:33:59.480 align:start position:0%
the criminal justice committee our
 
00:34:02.029 --> 00:34:02.039 align:start position:0%
chairman last year or the last term said
 
00:34:03.669 --> 00:34:03.679 align:start position:0%
that if we were specifically testifying
 
00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:06.720 align:start position:0%
on a bill that we were then not to be
 
00:34:09.589 --> 00:34:09.599 align:start position:0%
asking questions of people other people
 
00:34:11.909 --> 00:34:11.919 align:start position:0%
testifying on that same bill and I just
 
00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:14.560 align:start position:0%
wasn't sure if you had the same policy
 
00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:17.919 align:start position:0%
or or if it depended on context yes
 
00:34:19.869 --> 00:34:19.879 align:start position:0%
thank you for bringing that up yes um
 
00:34:23.389 --> 00:34:23.399 align:start position:0%
yeah we'd prefer that you not um ask
 
00:34:26.430 --> 00:34:26.440 align:start position:0%
questions if you've testified um on
 
00:34:28.909 --> 00:34:28.919 align:start position:0%
legislation um
 
00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:32.720 align:start position:0%
um even uh you can remain in the back
 
00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
after you
 
00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:35.750 align:start position:0%
after you
testify

00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
testify
 
00:34:41.629 --> 00:34:41.639 align:start position:0%
um but uh yeah it's uh probably the best
 
00:34:44.829 --> 00:34:44.839 align:start position:0%
to let um other people um ask their
 
00:34:47.109 --> 00:34:47.119 align:start position:0%
questions if you've testified uh because
 
00:34:49.149 --> 00:34:49.159 align:start position:0%
you do have a a Viewpoint that you've
 
00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:51.560 align:start position:0%

00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
um when uh what what bills will be EXA
 
00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
so for instance uh next Wednesday um we
 
00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
will be uh executing the bills that um
 
00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
we will hear this
 
00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
afternoon um so those will be in the
 
00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:49.640 align:start position:0%
calendar so I'll try and do that as much
 
00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
as uh possible um but there also might
 
00:35:57.390 --> 00:35:57.400 align:start position:0%
be some days when we uh uh bypass a bill
 
00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
that was even in the calendar for exec
 
00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
and pull that over for the next week um
 
00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:06.400 align:start position:0%
if we want to look at that some more but
 
00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
um yeah we'll try and let everybody know
 
00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:10.240 align:start position:0%
when we are executing bills and there'll
 
00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
be times uh possibly too where we have a
 
00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:17.720 align:start position:0%
hearing and um based on the questioning
 
00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
you know I'll ask the ranking member um
 
00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:24.200 align:start position:0%
how uh their caucus feels about
 
00:36:27.109 --> 00:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
legislation and um we could even move
 
00:36:30.349 --> 00:36:30.359 align:start position:0%
directly into um exec session and vote
 
00:36:33.309 --> 00:36:33.319 align:start position:0%
on a bill that um uh we're pretty much
 
00:36:36.589 --> 00:36:36.599 align:start position:0%
uh uh unanimous on which I think is uh
 
00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
something we did last term as well one
 
00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
more follow up thank you a different
 
00:36:45.069 --> 00:36:45.079 align:start position:0%
topic however um the first uh time I was
 
00:36:47.829 --> 00:36:47.839 align:start position:0%
here eight years ago the
 
00:36:51.309 --> 00:36:51.319 align:start position:0%
protocol um when I went to caucus was
 
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
that you may recall that both parties
 
00:36:55.470 --> 00:36:55.480 align:start position:0%
left so it allow the respect of the
 
00:36:58.069 --> 00:36:58.079 align:start position:0%
guests uh here
 
00:36:59.790 --> 00:36:59.800 align:start position:0%
uh and for those who haven't been here
 
00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:01.240 align:start position:0%
typically all those seats are full we
 
00:37:02.829 --> 00:37:02.839 align:start position:0%
have a hearing and everybody stands out
 
00:37:05.829 --> 00:37:05.839 align:start position:0%
in the hallway so um since both areas
 
00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
are open um is it possible this year as
 
00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
a courtesy to the people coming to
 
00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
witness the program and speak that when
 
00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:15.160 align:start position:0%
you we call a clus said both parties
 
00:37:17.069 --> 00:37:17.079 align:start position:0%
leave the room so the guests may stay
 
00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:19.720 align:start position:0%
here instead of standing the allall um I
 
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
I'll see depending on the numbers um but
 
00:37:26.109 --> 00:37:26.119 align:start position:0%
um yeah I had uh thought that for the
 
00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:27.720 align:start position:0%
most part we would do it the same way we
 
00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:30.520 align:start position:0%
did last year and that uh the majority
 
00:37:34.109 --> 00:37:34.119 align:start position:0%
will stay here okay um the office is a
 
00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
perfect place um for us now that we have
 
00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:39.880 align:start position:0%
our own office so that that would be a
 
00:37:41.829 --> 00:37:41.839 align:start position:0%
no the majority is going to stay in the
 
00:37:47.349 --> 00:37:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:50.829 --> 00:37:50.839 align:start position:0%
you uh yes representative Freeman thank
 
00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:54.640 align:start position:0%
you um Mr chair um piggybacking on the
 
00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
representative's question about um
 
00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:58.390 align:start position:0%
representative's question about um
testifying

00:37:58.390 --> 00:37:58.400 align:start position:0%
testifying
 
00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:00.680 align:start position:0%
and um at that point you shouldn't ask
 
00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:03.240 align:start position:0%
any questions would that metric stand
 
00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
for people who sponsor or co-sponsor
 
00:38:06.829 --> 00:38:06.839 align:start position:0%
bills that have brought in front of
 
00:38:09.630 --> 00:38:09.640 align:start position:0%
house education who sit on this
 
00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
committee um yeah that's um a good
 
00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:14.680 align:start position:0%
question I I would think that if you're
 
00:38:18.829 --> 00:38:18.839 align:start position:0%
a prime sponsor um you would not uh ask
 
00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:22.680 align:start position:0%
uh questions um of um those
 
00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:25.720 align:start position:0%
testifying um
 
00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
uh co-sponsor if you're not
 
00:38:33.309 --> 00:38:33.319 align:start position:0%
testifying um if I think if you ask a
 
00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:37.160 align:start position:0%
respectful question
 
00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
um really looking for
 
00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:42.760 align:start position:0%
information um I I don't have a problem
 
00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:44.550 align:start position:0%
information um I I don't have a problem
with

00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:48.720 align:start position:0%
that thank you sure uh represent
 
00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
Terry uh Mr chairman I noticed that
 
00:38:53.589 --> 00:38:53.599 align:start position:0%
there are at least two members on the
 
00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:56.240 align:start position:0%
committee who are uh brand new first
 
00:38:58.710 --> 00:38:58.720 align:start position:0%
term uh serving uh not only on the
 
00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
committee but also here in the house and
 
00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
so under the category of I I remember uh
 
00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
what it was like when I first began to
 
00:39:10.589 --> 00:39:10.599 align:start position:0%
serve on a committee and I saw uh a
 
00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
schedule for bills that are going to be
 
00:39:16.069 --> 00:39:16.079 align:start position:0%
heard and I looked at uh at the schedule
 
00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:18.200 align:start position:0%
and I thought all right the first one
 
00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
will be at 1:30 the second will be at
 
00:39:23.349 --> 00:39:23.359 align:start position:0%
2:15 and the third will be at 300 p.m.
 
00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
as in
 
00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:28.040 align:start position:0%
today and uh that that's not exactly how
 
00:39:30.750 --> 00:39:30.760 align:start position:0%
it went a lot of times and so for your
 
00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:32.030 align:start position:0%
it went a lot of times and so for your
benefit

00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
00:39:34.589 --> 00:39:34.599 align:start position:0%
particularly um here's the bad news if
 
00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
if the bill that we hear today at 1:30
 
00:39:39.589 --> 00:39:39.599 align:start position:0%
the hearing is over in 10 minutes
 
00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:42.200 align:start position:0%
nevertheless we have to wait until 2:15
 
00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:44.200 align:start position:0%
and I think that makes sense because
 
00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:47.960 align:start position:0%
people may be coming uh specifically to
 
00:39:51.309 --> 00:39:51.319 align:start position:0%
uh to hear or to testify on the bill at
 
00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
215 but here's the here's the real bad
 
00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
news and that is that if the bill that
 
00:39:59.510 --> 00:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
is being heard at 1:30 for example goes
 
00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:02.680 align:start position:0%
on for 45 minutes to an hour or an hour
 
00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
and a half that's what happens we don't
 
00:40:08.190 --> 00:40:08.200 align:start position:0%
stop at 2:15 and then go on to the next
 
00:40:11.069 --> 00:40:11.079 align:start position:0%
bill we hear everybody who comes
 
00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:13.800 align:start position:0%
questions are asked and so forth so if
 
00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:16.960 align:start position:0%
you're if you're thinking that um the
 
00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
schedule is the schedule it's kind of
 
00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
sort of like the schedule with the uh
 
00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:24.760 align:start position:0%
commentary that I just provided we we do
 
00:40:27.309 --> 00:40:27.319 align:start position:0%
have the option of of recessing a here
 
00:40:30.270 --> 00:40:30.280 align:start position:0%
hearing um and then coming back later in
 
00:40:35.190 --> 00:40:35.200 align:start position:0%
the day um or um at a future date um
 
00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
certain so that is an option yes thank
 
00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:41.240 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair just to followup luckily I
 
00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
plan when I come here I'm going to be
 
00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
here till 10 p.m. 8 900 p.m. whenever so
 
00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:52.760 align:start position:0%
I I I I I would say that you don't have
 
00:40:57.430 --> 00:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:58.910 --> 00:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
lville thank you for taking my question
 
00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
I two questions if that's okay um one is
 
00:41:09.069 --> 00:41:09.079 align:start position:0%
superficial but important to me um let's
 
00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:11.640 align:start position:0%
just say hypothetically speaking and if
 
00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:13.720 align:start position:0%
it's no I understand hypothetically
 
00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
speaking someone has maybe never ever
 
00:41:17.829 --> 00:41:17.839 align:start position:0%
drank a drop of coffee in their entire
 
00:41:20.069 --> 00:41:20.079 align:start position:0%
life and not a huge fan of water or
 
00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
green vegetables um is diet soda allowed
 
00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:25.800 align:start position:0%
sure here yeah okay thank you um and
 
00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:30.640 align:start position:0%
then my second question is um regarding
 
00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:33.240 align:start position:0%
the bills I'm just wondering if it's
 
00:41:36.829 --> 00:41:36.839 align:start position:0%
possible for us either to get the print
 
00:41:39.069 --> 00:41:39.079 align:start position:0%
outs of the bills a week ahead of time
 
00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:42.040 align:start position:0%
for us to prepare or even possibly I
 
00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:43.480 align:start position:0%
don't know whether this makes sense or
 
00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
not but let's say we have 36 at this
 
00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
point if we even had them printed in the
 
00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
three-hole paper punch I know for me I
 
00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
use like you do the notebook to keep
 
00:41:55.589 --> 00:41:55.599 align:start position:0%
them in and if there are some of us that
 
00:41:57.670 --> 00:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
maybe they might get misplaced you can
 
00:41:59.470 --> 00:41:59.480 align:start position:0%
keep it in your drawer in the office
 
00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
just throwing it out there but I'm
 
00:42:01.710 --> 00:42:01.720 align:start position:0%
wondering if we can get it even a week
 
00:42:04.309 --> 00:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
ahead of time to prepare or possibly all
 
00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
ahead of time yeah um thank you good
 
00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
good questions I wanted to bring up
 
00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
copying also um you have some I think
 
00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
information from um house committee
 
00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:17.160 align:start position:0%
Services uh on your desk um contact
 
00:42:19.829 --> 00:42:19.839 align:start position:0%
information and so forth um up on the
 
00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
fourth floor uh they are happy to make
 
00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
uh copies for you um if you have an
 
00:42:28.030 --> 00:42:28.040 align:start position:0%
amendment or information you want to
 
00:42:32.109 --> 00:42:32.119 align:start position:0%
provide uh to the committee um uh you
 
00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
can uh take it or email it up to them um
 
00:42:37.950 --> 00:42:37.960 align:start position:0%
there's their email address on there
 
00:42:39.150 --> 00:42:39.160 align:start position:0%
it's just
 
00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
ACS well whatever the new address is
 
00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:46.720 align:start position:0%
going to be um and um yeah uh some of us
 
00:42:50.829 --> 00:42:50.839 align:start position:0%
do like notebooks so um I think a a rule
 
00:42:53.549 --> 00:42:53.559 align:start position:0%
of thumb would be uh um three hole
 
00:42:57.270 --> 00:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
request three hole punched um and uh
 
00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:58.470 align:start position:0%
request three hole punched um and uh
also

00:42:58.470 --> 00:42:58.480 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:43:01.870 --> 00:43:01.880 align:start position:0%
double-sided um as a um a
 
00:43:04.349 --> 00:43:04.359 align:start position:0%
possibility uh if
 
00:43:08.069 --> 00:43:08.079 align:start position:0%
possible um but uh yeah they're great in
 
00:43:11.589 --> 00:43:11.599 align:start position:0%
terms of U making copies and if you get
 
00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
off the elevator on the left there are
 
00:43:18.190 --> 00:43:18.200 align:start position:0%
folders um and um they will put your
 
00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
copies in there um with a little uh
 
00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
sticky note with your name on
 
00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:25.790 align:start position:0%
sticky note with your name on
it

00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:25.800 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:43:31.069 --> 00:43:31.079 align:start position:0%
um and we are also um having uh the
 
00:43:35.069 --> 00:43:35.079 align:start position:0%
printer uh in our office set up uh so we
 
00:43:37.390 --> 00:43:37.400 align:start position:0%
can mail things to the
 
00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:42.640 align:start position:0%
printer um for printing um specifically
 
00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
um attachments to an email you can email
 
00:43:49.829 --> 00:43:49.839 align:start position:0%
it to whatever the printer name is um
 
00:43:53.109 --> 00:43:53.119 align:start position:0%
and the attachment would be printed um
 
00:43:57.430 --> 00:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
so that's um an option if um required um
 
00:44:01.829 --> 00:44:01.839 align:start position:0%
in a short space of time um but uh HCS
 
00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:05.880 align:start position:0%
and Jen who is often here um are uh very
 
00:44:07.829 --> 00:44:07.839 align:start position:0%
helpful in terms of getting copies made
 
00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
needed y um back to the the the bills
 
00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
they will be printed for us uh it's
 
00:44:23.470 --> 00:44:23.480 align:start position:0%
being worked on right the um yeah many I
 
00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:25.000 align:start position:0%
was so afraid you were going back to the
 
00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:28.240 align:start position:0%
diet Pepsi not the bill
 
00:44:32.109 --> 00:44:32.119 align:start position:0%
um no we have a a number of bills
 
00:44:37.230 --> 00:44:37.240 align:start position:0%
um uh left on the desk for us
 
00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:40.480 align:start position:0%
um when we see the bill online as
 
00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:43.800 align:start position:0%
available um there is still a lag time
 
00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:45.160 align:start position:0%
uh for
 
00:44:48.910 --> 00:44:48.920 align:start position:0%
printing um so we don't get them um as
 
00:44:51.670 --> 00:44:51.680 align:start position:0%
uh quickly as uh you might see them
 
00:44:56.069 --> 00:44:56.079 align:start position:0%
online but um uh Karen Davis our clerk
 
00:44:57.790 --> 00:44:57.800 align:start position:0%
um is working
 
00:44:59.950 --> 00:44:59.960 align:start position:0%
uh to uh get them printed and available
 
00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:03.400 align:start position:0%
to us um as soon as um they get copies
 
00:45:06.109 --> 00:45:06.119 align:start position:0%
of our bills so that we definitely
 
00:45:09.430 --> 00:45:09.440 align:start position:0%
should have uh the bill uh available for
 
00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:10.069 align:start position:0%
should have uh the bill uh available for
the

00:45:10.069 --> 00:45:10.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:12.880 align:start position:0%
hearing that should not be a problem
 
00:45:17.109 --> 00:45:17.119 align:start position:0%
yes uh question Mr chair um as far as
 
00:45:19.270 --> 00:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
when you file a
 
00:45:27.390 --> 00:45:27.400 align:start position:0%
bill uh when is a deadline for final uh
 
00:45:30.030 --> 00:45:30.040 align:start position:0%
uh approval of the written
 
00:45:34.109 --> 00:45:34.119 align:start position:0%
bill before you get to vote uh to go to
 
00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
committee yeah like an amendment or the
 
00:45:39.790 --> 00:45:39.800 align:start position:0%
B uh well amendments I I guess right up
 
00:45:42.829 --> 00:45:42.839 align:start position:0%
until the last moment correct but a
 
00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:46.240 align:start position:0%
final uh print out of a bill so we can
 
00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:48.030 align:start position:0%
final uh print out of a bill so we can
examine

00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:48.040 align:start position:0%
examine
 
00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
it um well if if you're the prime
 
00:45:54.150 --> 00:45:54.160 align:start position:0%
sponsor you've already signed off on it
 
00:45:57.069 --> 00:45:57.079 align:start position:0%
okay right um or a co-sponsor if you
 
00:45:59.150 --> 00:45:59.160 align:start position:0%
want a co-sponsor bill you have already
 
00:46:01.589 --> 00:46:01.599 align:start position:0%
signed off on it um before it actually
 
00:46:03.309 --> 00:46:03.319 align:start position:0%
becomes a
 
00:46:03.319 --> 00:46:05.510 align:start position:0%
becomes a
bill

00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:46:08.230 --> 00:46:08.240 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:46:11.309 --> 00:46:11.319 align:start position:0%
uh yeah with
 
00:46:16.309 --> 00:46:16.319 align:start position:0%
amendments um you would send submit the
 
00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh proposed amendment to legislative
 
00:46:23.190 --> 00:46:23.200 align:start position:0%
Services just like submitting a bill um
 
00:46:25.349 --> 00:46:25.359 align:start position:0%
and uh I think they have a form now
 
00:46:28.670 --> 00:46:28.680 align:start position:0%
about um uh with information that they
 
00:46:31.829 --> 00:46:31.839 align:start position:0%
want when you submit uh an amendment um
 
00:46:34.030 --> 00:46:34.040 align:start position:0%
but you definitely have to give them a a
 
00:46:35.589 --> 00:46:35.599 align:start position:0%
time frame on when you need that
 
00:46:38.190 --> 00:46:38.200 align:start position:0%
Amendment back um and then they will
 
00:46:43.069 --> 00:46:43.079 align:start position:0%
email you the um the bill um and that's
 
00:46:45.549 --> 00:46:45.559 align:start position:0%
when you could send it up to HCS to have
 
00:46:48.430 --> 00:46:48.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:53.069 --> 00:46:53.079 align:start position:0%
made yes so I just want to be uh clear
 
00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
uh and by way of example there was an
 
00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
email that um that I saw I think I saw
 
00:47:02.470 --> 00:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
in any event we have bills that are
 
00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
going to be considered next
 
00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:06.990 align:start position:0%
going to be considered next
week

00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:07.000 align:start position:0%
week
 
00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:12.640 align:start position:0%
um so if we want access to paper copies
 
00:47:15.950 --> 00:47:15.960 align:start position:0%
of those bills prior to next week before
 
00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
we actually walk into the Committee
 
00:47:21.109 --> 00:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
hearing that day uh did I hear you say
 
00:47:23.470 --> 00:47:23.480 align:start position:0%
that those would be available to us
 
00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
prior to next Wednesday next week that's
 
00:47:29.069 --> 00:47:29.079 align:start position:0%
something that's being worked on now I
 
00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
think we have hard or do we just go and
 
00:47:34.510 --> 00:47:34.520 align:start position:0%
search for these on gen the three that
 
00:47:36.549 --> 00:47:36.559 align:start position:0%
we have today I think we have copies of
 
00:47:42.510 --> 00:47:42.520 align:start position:0%
yes right and um uh we should have hard
 
00:47:44.990 --> 00:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
copies when we come in I don't know
 
00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:48.640 align:start position:0%
about hard copies prior um especially
 
00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
when they're trying to get all the bills
 
00:47:53.470 --> 00:47:53.480 align:start position:0%
printed um you know later on in the
 
00:47:56.430 --> 00:47:56.440 align:start position:0%
session it it it won't be a problem but
 
00:47:59.109 --> 00:47:59.119 align:start position:0%
right now when they have a a backlog of
 
00:48:03.790 --> 00:48:03.800 align:start position:0%
um bills to even get to printing um U
 
00:48:06.829 --> 00:48:06.839 align:start position:0%
printing has a backlog as well okay so
 
00:48:08.910 --> 00:48:08.920 align:start position:0%
so just to be clear then for for
 
00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:11.400 align:start position:0%
everybody that means that when we
 
00:48:14.910 --> 00:48:14.920 align:start position:0%
receive notice of the meeting next week
 
00:48:16.990 --> 00:48:17.000 align:start position:0%
and a list of the bills that are going
 
00:48:20.950 --> 00:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
to be heard next week that if if any
 
00:48:23.829 --> 00:48:23.839 align:start position:0%
member would want to examine those bills
 
00:48:26.309 --> 00:48:26.319 align:start position:0%
prior to the date of the committee
 
00:48:28.549 --> 00:48:28.559 align:start position:0%
meeting the hearing on those bills you
 
00:48:31.349 --> 00:48:31.359 align:start position:0%
would go to gen Court website and you do
 
00:48:34.430 --> 00:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
a search for those bills save them on
 
00:48:36.109 --> 00:48:36.119 align:start position:0%
your computer or print them out or
 
00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
whatever but otherwise you would not see
 
00:48:40.309 --> 00:48:40.319 align:start position:0%
them until you actually walk in the room
 
00:48:41.950 --> 00:48:41.960 align:start position:0%

um uh that's pretty much
 
01:06:46.230 --> 01:06:46.240 align:start position:0%

had to remember to turn on my microphone
 
01:07:46.390 --> 01:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
as I sat down so kudos to you because I
 
01:07:48.589 --> 01:07:48.599 align:start position:0%
always forget to turn on my microphone
 
01:07:50.349 --> 01:07:50.359 align:start position:0%
and I also assume that because I'm an
 
01:07:53.950 --> 01:07:53.960 align:start position:0%
attorney I'm just naturally loud um but
 
01:07:56.670 --> 01:07:56.680 align:start position:0%

Education I'll be the first to tell you
 
01:08:06.349 --> 01:08:06.359 align:start position:0%
I am uh not from the field of Education
 
01:08:07.990 --> 01:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
um however I am a product of New
 
01:08:10.549 --> 01:08:10.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire public education I graduated
 
01:08:14.349 --> 01:08:14.359 align:start position:0%
from kennet high school um in Conway the
 
01:08:18.229 --> 01:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
year shall remain confidential um and uh
 
01:08:20.510 --> 01:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
we just had a little uh group meeting
 
01:08:23.229 --> 01:08:23.239 align:start position:0%
over here that apparently we we all have
 
01:08:24.910 --> 01:08:24.920 align:start position:0%
a connection to the same undergrad
 
01:08:26.870 --> 01:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
College that I went to that no one has
 
01:08:28.749 --> 01:08:28.759 align:start position:0%
ever heard of until this very moment
 
01:08:30.510 --> 01:08:30.520 align:start position:0%
where I've met more people that have
 
01:08:34.709 --> 01:08:34.719 align:start position:0%
that connection that I've ever met so um
 
01:08:36.349 --> 01:08:36.359 align:start position:0%
my mom was a special ed teacher in New
 
01:08:38.669 --> 01:08:38.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and when I called her and told
 
01:08:40.709 --> 01:08:40.719 align:start position:0%
her I was going to law school her uh
 
01:08:43.149 --> 01:08:43.159 align:start position:0%
reaction was I don't like those people
 
01:08:45.030 --> 01:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
and I really want you to be a teacher so
 
01:08:47.269 --> 01:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
this job is really just to make my mom
 
01:08:49.829 --> 01:08:49.839 align:start position:0%
happy um and to to thank all the
 
01:08:51.430 --> 01:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
Educators out there and all their hard
 
01:08:56.430 --> 01:08:56.440 align:start position:0%
work uh so I want to talk to you today
 
01:08:58.390 --> 01:08:58.400 align:start position:0%
about the role of the department we
 
01:09:00.510 --> 01:09:00.520 align:start position:0%
present in a very different way than a
 
01:09:01.789 --> 01:09:01.799 align:start position:0%
lot of the testimony you're going to
 
01:09:03.709 --> 01:09:03.719 align:start position:0%
hear because we are here to provide
 
01:09:06.269 --> 01:09:06.279 align:start position:0%
technical assistance we do not support
 
01:09:09.229 --> 01:09:09.239 align:start position:0%
or oppose any bill but we can find
 
01:09:11.910 --> 01:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
information for you um we'll go over our
 
01:09:14.030 --> 01:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
website a little bit but we really are
 
01:09:15.910 --> 01:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
just to provide that technical support
 
01:09:18.430 --> 01:09:18.440 align:start position:0%
technical assistance to say this is how
 
01:09:20.349 --> 01:09:20.359 align:start position:0%
the department would interpret this this
 
01:09:22.030 --> 01:09:22.040 align:start position:0%
is what the department needs this is
 
01:09:23.709 --> 01:09:23.719 align:start position:0%
what the department can offer and that's
 
01:09:27.149 --> 01:09:27.159 align:start position:0%
very different testimony from a lobbyist
 
01:09:30.229 --> 01:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
or a parent or a citizen that you will
 
01:09:33.269 --> 01:09:33.279 align:start position:0%
obviously hear from um and so
 
01:09:36.110 --> 01:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
again sometimes people will ask us what
 
01:09:38.590 --> 01:09:38.600 align:start position:0%
do you think of this and the answer is
 
01:09:40.950 --> 01:09:40.960 align:start position:0%
we have no opinion that is for you to
 
01:09:44.070 --> 01:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
decide um but I wanted to go over the
 
01:09:46.070 --> 01:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
law books with you and just give you
 
01:09:49.510 --> 01:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
some ideas of how to best use the law
 
01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
books they can be a little daunting at
 
01:09:54.070 --> 01:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
times but I want to make it very um kind
 
01:09:57.430 --> 01:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
of user friendly and accessible for you
 
01:09:59.790 --> 01:09:59.800 align:start position:0%
as we go through please feel free to ask
 
01:10:02.229 --> 01:10:02.239 align:start position:0%
questions um because again I'm an
 
01:10:04.630 --> 01:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
attorney I like to talk so if you have a
 
01:10:08.310 --> 01:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
question please feel free to redirect me
 
01:10:10.830 --> 01:10:10.840 align:start position:0%
so there's a couple of ways first of all
 
01:10:12.590 --> 01:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
everyone loves having the paper copy of
 
01:10:14.950 --> 01:10:14.960 align:start position:0%
the law book but you can find the laws
 
01:10:17.750 --> 01:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
online multiple
 
01:10:21.189 --> 01:10:21.199 align:start position:0%
ways and I will just toggle out of this
 
01:10:21.199 --> 01:10:22.550 align:start position:0%
ways and I will just toggle out of this
very

01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:10:25.990 --> 01:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
quickly if you go to our website we have
 
01:10:29.149 --> 01:10:29.159 align:start position:0%
the laws on our website and we have the
 
01:10:31.149 --> 01:10:31.159 align:start position:0%
lawbook reprinted on our website and
 
01:10:32.950 --> 01:10:32.960 align:start position:0%
that's great if you like to just do the
 
01:10:35.189 --> 01:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
control F excuse me are you going to
 
01:10:36.630 --> 01:10:36.640 align:start position:0%
would you be able to make these slides
 
01:10:37.870 --> 01:10:37.880 align:start position:0%
available to the members of the
 
01:10:39.950 --> 01:10:39.960 align:start position:0%
committee when you're finished because I
 
01:10:42.510 --> 01:10:42.520 align:start position:0%
I can't even see what's up there from my
 
01:10:44.430 --> 01:10:44.440 align:start position:0%
angle yes so I just have to rely on my
 
01:10:45.910 --> 01:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
ear thank you sure we can do that for
 
01:11:00.990 --> 01:11:01.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:03.870 --> 01:11:03.880 align:start position:0%
oh there you go is that better and
 
01:11:05.189 --> 01:11:05.199 align:start position:0%
you're going to be very good friends
 
01:11:08.990 --> 01:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
with uh representative next to you
 
01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
um there you go so we do have the law
 
01:11:14.470 --> 01:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
book on our website that you can find
 
01:11:16.790 --> 01:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
that and that's a great resource if You'
 
01:11:19.310 --> 01:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
like to do the control F function we are
 
01:11:21.470 --> 01:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
also going to talk about the index of
 
01:11:23.590 --> 01:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
this book and how best to use
 
01:11:25.950 --> 01:11:25.960 align:start position:0%
it we also have
 
01:11:28.750 --> 01:11:28.760 align:start position:0%
uh the rules some technical advisories
 
01:11:31.229 --> 01:11:31.239 align:start position:0%
on our website but we will get into
 
01:11:36.510 --> 01:11:36.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:38.750 --> 01:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
presentation so it's very fitting at
 
01:11:40.310 --> 01:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
this moment that everything has seemed
 
01:11:43.030 --> 01:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
to have Frozen up on me here so give me
 
01:11:44.790 --> 01:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
just a
 
01:11:48.189 --> 01:11:48.199 align:start position:0%
minute oh there we go all right and
 
01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
we're back so we're going to start with
 
01:11:53.229 --> 01:11:53.239 align:start position:0%
RSA 21n so if you want to follow along
 
01:11:55.390 --> 01:11:55.400 align:start position:0%
in your law book you certainly can
 
01:11:57.189 --> 01:11:57.199 align:start position:0%
what's interesting about the education
 
01:12:00.910 --> 01:12:00.920 align:start position:0%
laws is they cover an enormous amount of
 
01:12:04.110 --> 01:12:04.120 align:start position:0%
material that may or may not be relevant
 
01:12:05.229 --> 01:12:05.239 align:start position:0%
to this
 
01:12:08.430 --> 01:12:08.440 align:start position:0%
particular legislative session and there
 
01:12:10.310 --> 01:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
will be times where you suddenly find
 
01:12:12.470 --> 01:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
yourself in a
 
01:12:15.390 --> 01:12:15.400 align:start position:0%
chapter that you have not ever referred
 
01:12:18.470 --> 01:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
to and this is not the kind of book that
 
01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:21.280 align:start position:0%
you would take home and read and I
 
01:12:22.990 --> 01:12:23.000 align:start position:0%
always suggest to people that's just not
 
01:12:25.590 --> 01:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
going to be an effective measure the way
 
01:12:28.229 --> 01:12:28.239 align:start position:0%
to do it is to take the law I know there
 
01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
was a lot of discussion about getting
 
01:12:31.990 --> 01:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
the bills ahead of time I think that's a
 
01:12:34.430 --> 01:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
great suggestion because the key to
 
01:12:38.470 --> 01:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
success is to take that proposed Bill
 
01:12:41.470 --> 01:12:41.480 align:start position:0%
and put it into context with the
 
01:12:44.310 --> 01:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
chapter open it up and put it into
 
01:12:47.229 --> 01:12:47.239 align:start position:0%
context and see what the bill is
 
01:12:50.149 --> 01:12:50.159 align:start position:0%
proposing is it adding a new section is
 
01:12:52.709 --> 01:12:52.719 align:start position:0%
it repealing something is it amending a
 
01:12:55.229 --> 01:12:55.239 align:start position:0%
current section and put it into context
 
01:12:57.830 --> 01:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
text with the bill and the law as
 
01:12:59.669 --> 01:12:59.679 align:start position:0%
currently written so we're going to
 
01:13:03.390 --> 01:13:03.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
21n and 21n just talks about the the
 
01:13:11.669 --> 01:13:11.679 align:start position:0%
setup of the department now when um the
 
01:13:13.990 --> 01:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner edelblute first started he
 
01:13:16.990 --> 01:13:17.000 align:start position:0%
did um a consolidation of the department
 
01:13:20.870 --> 01:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
and so we had bills pertaining to 21n of
 
01:13:22.830 --> 01:13:22.840 align:start position:0%
how the department was divided all the
 
01:13:25.229 --> 01:13:25.239 align:start position:0%
different division directors who Mo most
 
01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
of you met on Monday at the law Day
 
01:13:30.310 --> 01:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
presentation at the department those are
 
01:13:33.070 --> 01:13:33.080 align:start position:0%
all created
 
01:13:36.110 --> 01:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
statutorily so 21n establishes the
 
01:13:38.910 --> 01:13:38.920 align:start position:0%
department and the duties of the State
 
01:13:43.950 --> 01:13:43.960 align:start position:0%
Board 21 N9 talks about the board's
 
01:13:45.669 --> 01:13:45.679 align:start position:0%
rulle making Authority and I want to be
 
01:13:47.390 --> 01:13:47.400 align:start position:0%
really careful in our language there
 
01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
because oftentimes we will say the
 
01:13:52.149 --> 01:13:52.159 align:start position:0%
Department's rule making Authority but
 
01:13:54.390 --> 01:13:54.400 align:start position:0%
the department does not have ruem
 
01:13:57.629 --> 01:13:57.639 align:start position:0%
authority it is the state board that has
 
01:14:00.189 --> 01:14:00.199 align:start position:0%
rulem Authority and that is a critical
 
01:14:02.110 --> 01:14:02.120 align:start position:0%
distinction between the Department of
 
01:14:04.790 --> 01:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
Education and most other state
 
01:14:06.910 --> 01:14:06.920 align:start position:0%
agencies and it might sound kind of
 
01:14:09.590 --> 01:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
picky and nuanced and I'm a lawyer I get
 
01:14:11.950 --> 01:14:11.960 align:start position:0%
paid really well to be picky and nuanced
 
01:14:14.270 --> 01:14:14.280 align:start position:0%
but it is a critical distinction that
 
01:14:16.910 --> 01:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
the rul making Authority belongs to the
 
01:14:18.229 --> 01:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
state board and we're going to talk
 
01:14:20.189 --> 01:14:20.199 align:start position:0%
about what rul making Authority looks
 
01:14:23.070 --> 01:14:23.080 align:start position:0%
like in the proposed bills that you will
 
01:14:29.629 --> 01:14:29.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:31.510 --> 01:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
and again what we're doing today is
 
01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
really just a highlevel 10,000 foot
 
01:14:36.790 --> 01:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
overview of the laws that we anticipate
 
01:14:39.149 --> 01:14:39.159 align:start position:0%
will come before you and just to give
 
01:14:41.030 --> 01:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
you that
 
01:14:43.629 --> 01:14:43.639 align:start position:0%
familiarity so as I go along if you have
 
01:14:45.550 --> 01:14:45.560 align:start position:0%
an area that you want to discuss at more
 
01:14:47.350 --> 01:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
depth I'd be happy to do that because
 
01:14:50.030 --> 01:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
this really is going to be a cursory
 
01:14:52.470 --> 01:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
overview I want to point your attention
 
01:15:10.070 --> 01:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:12.149 --> 01:15:12.159 align:start position:0%
11 when I first started at the
 
01:15:13.510 --> 01:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Education I had a
 
01:15:15.390 --> 01:15:15.400 align:start position:0%
wonderful co-counsel who used to just
 
01:15:17.669 --> 01:15:17.679 align:start position:0%
tell me the page number of the book
 
01:15:19.430 --> 01:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
because I was leaping through it and it
 
01:15:21.629 --> 01:15:21.639 align:start position:0%
took me so long that she would just lose
 
01:15:25.669 --> 01:15:25.679 align:start position:0%
patience with me and go it's on page 335
 
01:15:27.629 --> 01:15:27.639 align:start position:0%
and I thought that was so helpful I do
 
01:15:29.110 --> 01:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
that to commissioner edelblute and he
 
01:15:31.070 --> 01:15:31.080 align:start position:0%
says I can find the law don't give me
 
01:15:33.270 --> 01:15:33.280 align:start position:0%
the page number but for those of us who
 
01:15:36.830 --> 01:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
like the page number it's on page 335 I
 
01:15:38.310 --> 01:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
find it very
 
01:15:42.790 --> 01:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:46.390 --> 01:15:46.400 align:start position:0%
18611 this is a really interesting law
 
01:15:50.149 --> 01:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
because it kind of mirrors 21 N9 the rul
 
01:15:50.159 --> 01:15:51.350 align:start position:0%
because it kind of mirrors 21 N9 the rul
making

01:15:51.350 --> 01:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
making
 
01:15:53.910 --> 01:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
Authority it talks about the duties of
 
01:15:55.510 --> 01:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
the State Board of educ
 
01:15:58.790 --> 01:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
a I highlight this for a couple of
 
01:16:01.590 --> 01:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
reasons you will find sections in this
 
01:16:05.030 --> 01:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
book that are very close to being
 
01:16:08.110 --> 01:16:08.120 align:start position:0%
duplicative of other sections but you
 
01:16:10.189 --> 01:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
have to read both of them because there
 
01:16:12.510 --> 01:16:12.520 align:start position:0%
will be areas that are covered in one
 
01:16:13.950 --> 01:16:13.960 align:start position:0%
that are not covered in the other there
 
01:16:17.229 --> 01:16:17.239 align:start position:0%
is a reason the legislature passed it so
 
01:16:18.590 --> 01:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
when we look at
 
01:16:22.510 --> 01:16:22.520 align:start position:0%
1861 duties of the State Board of
 
01:16:24.629 --> 01:16:24.639 align:start position:0%
Education I'm going to bring your
 
01:16:24.639 --> 01:16:26.510 align:start position:0%
Education I'm going to bring your
attention

01:16:26.510 --> 01:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
attention
 
01:16:29.350 --> 01:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
attention to Roman
 
01:16:34.149 --> 01:16:34.159 align:start position:0%
numeral 9 C and 9 D and it's at this
 
01:16:36.390 --> 01:16:36.400 align:start position:0%
moment in time that I take a pause and
 
01:16:38.550 --> 01:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
think I hope I just said that Roman
 
01:16:40.149 --> 01:16:40.159 align:start position:0%
numeral correctly because every time I
 
01:16:41.750 --> 01:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
look at the Super Bowl I'm like I have
 
01:16:44.070 --> 01:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
no idea what number that is so I think
 
01:16:47.310 --> 01:16:47.320 align:start position:0%
it is 9 C and 9d if I'm wrong please
 
01:16:51.590 --> 01:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
feel free to correct me but every year
 
01:16:55.550 --> 01:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
these two sections are come for this
 
01:16:58.149 --> 01:16:58.159 align:start position:0%
this policy committee these are hot
 
01:17:01.110 --> 01:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
button topics uh the first one is
 
01:17:03.030 --> 01:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
requiring the school district to adopt a
 
01:17:05.790 --> 01:17:05.800 align:start position:0%
policy allowing an exception to course
 
01:17:10.270 --> 01:17:10.280 align:start position:0%
material and uh 9d is adopting a policy
 
01:17:12.430 --> 01:17:12.440 align:start position:0%
governing the uh administration of
 
01:17:16.110 --> 01:17:16.120 align:start position:0%
nonacademic surveys and questionnaires I
 
01:17:18.310 --> 01:17:18.320 align:start position:0%
cannot think of a legislative session
 
01:17:19.310 --> 01:17:19.320 align:start position:0%
that has
 
01:17:23.149 --> 01:17:23.159 align:start position:0%
not at least considered a bill that
 
01:17:25.390 --> 01:17:25.400 align:start position:0%
covers that law
 
01:17:27.629 --> 01:17:27.639 align:start position:0%
represented cordelli have
 
01:17:27.639 --> 01:17:29.229 align:start position:0%
represented cordelli have
you

01:17:29.229 --> 01:17:29.239 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:17:32.990 --> 01:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
it's there you there you go what I like
 
01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:34.189 align:start position:0%
it's there you there you go what I like
about

01:17:34.189 --> 01:17:34.199 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:17:38.070 --> 01:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
18611 9d and I want to point it out for
 
01:17:43.070 --> 01:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
you so now I'm looking at page
 
01:17:46.910 --> 01:17:46.920 align:start position:0%
336 and I'm in the leftand
 
01:17:49.870 --> 01:17:49.880 align:start position:0%
column and I'm under the heading
 
01:17:53.189 --> 01:17:53.199 align:start position:0%
9d and as you look at that
 
01:17:55.950 --> 01:17:55.960 align:start position:0%
paragraph I want to highlight for you
 
01:17:59.390 --> 01:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
that it is at the very bottom of the
 
01:18:03.030 --> 01:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
paragraph where it gives the definition
 
01:18:08.030 --> 01:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
of the term non-academic survey or
 
01:18:10.590 --> 01:18:10.600 align:start position:0%
questionnaire that definition becomes
 
01:18:12.709 --> 01:18:12.719 align:start position:0%
critical to your analysis as a
 
01:18:16.350 --> 01:18:16.360 align:start position:0%
legislator your work as a policy
 
01:18:20.149 --> 01:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
maker and it's interesting because as we
 
01:18:23.229 --> 01:18:23.239 align:start position:0%
go through this book in most of the
 
01:18:25.510 --> 01:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
chapters and most of the titles
 
01:18:28.310 --> 01:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
you will see the definition section set
 
01:18:30.390 --> 01:18:30.400 align:start position:0%
out and set
 
01:18:32.830 --> 01:18:32.840 align:start position:0%
apart and it's very clear what the
 
01:18:35.270 --> 01:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
definitions are but it is not
 
01:18:37.910 --> 01:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily clear in
 
01:18:40.790 --> 01:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
9d if you're anything like me you take
 
01:18:42.830 --> 01:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
your highlighter and you highlight that
 
01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
definition section because I can tell
 
01:18:47.030 --> 01:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
you as an attorney having read this
 
01:18:49.070 --> 01:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
section many times having written about
 
01:18:51.990 --> 01:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
this section it always surprises me that
 
01:18:54.950 --> 01:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
the definition is at the very bottom oh
 
01:19:05.070 --> 01:19:05.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:10.070 --> 01:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:12.669 --> 01:19:12.679 align:start position:0%
law right around in the middle of the
 
01:19:15.030 --> 01:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
paragraph and I have mine
 
01:19:17.870 --> 01:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
underlined they talk about the youth
 
01:19:21.310 --> 01:19:21.320 align:start position:0%
risk behavior survey as developed by the
 
01:19:22.990 --> 01:19:23.000 align:start position:0%
Centers for Disease Control and
 
01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.510 align:start position:0%
Centers for Disease Control and
prevention

01:19:25.510 --> 01:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
prevention
 
01:19:28.709 --> 01:19:28.719 align:start position:0%
you will hear that term youth risk
 
01:19:28.719 --> 01:19:30.629 align:start position:0%
you will hear that term youth risk
behavior

01:19:30.629 --> 01:19:30.639 align:start position:0%
behavior
 
01:19:33.910 --> 01:19:33.920 align:start position:0%
survey short-handed as the
 
01:19:36.390 --> 01:19:36.400 align:start position:0%
yrbs and when people from the Department
 
01:19:39.110 --> 01:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
come to testify they will refer to it
 
01:19:42.030 --> 01:19:42.040 align:start position:0%
very quickly and succinctly as the
 
01:19:44.390 --> 01:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
yrbs and I will share with you on a
 
01:19:46.629 --> 01:19:46.639 align:start position:0%
personal note I think I F I spent the
 
01:19:48.830 --> 01:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
first year of my time at the Department
 
01:19:52.990 --> 01:19:53.000 align:start position:0%
of Education going the what I had no
 
01:19:55.430 --> 01:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
idea what the yrbs was and people said
 
01:19:57.669 --> 01:19:57.679 align:start position:0%
it so quickly and so confidently I
 
01:19:59.470 --> 01:19:59.480 align:start position:0%
thought well I should probably just nod
 
01:20:01.790 --> 01:20:01.800 align:start position:0%
and smile and play along but I don't
 
01:20:04.709 --> 01:20:04.719 align:start position:0%
want you to have that same experience so
 
01:20:07.430 --> 01:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
it is the youth risk behavior survey and
 
01:20:10.189 --> 01:20:10.199 align:start position:0%
you will hear it be called the yrbs this
 
01:20:13.750 --> 01:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
is a very controversial hot button topic
 
01:20:16.229 --> 01:20:16.239 align:start position:0%
is that a fair assessment I don't want
 
01:20:18.709 --> 01:20:18.719 align:start position:0%
to speak out of turn again our role is
 
01:20:20.550 --> 01:20:20.560 align:start position:0%
really to just provide that technical
 
01:20:23.229 --> 01:20:23.239 align:start position:0%
assistance but I have yet to experience
 
01:20:25.910 --> 01:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
a legislative session where this law has
 
01:20:28.910 --> 01:20:28.920 align:start position:0%
not been discussed so
 
01:20:32.189 --> 01:20:32.199 align:start position:0%
18611 Roman numeral D and as you see
 
01:20:34.310 --> 01:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
there are other sections in this law
 
01:20:42.430 --> 01:20:42.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:44.590 --> 01:20:44.600 align:start position:0%
consideration so we're going to move
 
01:20:48.750 --> 01:20:48.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:51.350 --> 01:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
18660 and this governs the Professional
 
01:20:55.270 --> 01:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
Standards Board I know that last session
 
01:20:57.790 --> 01:20:57.800 align:start position:0%
this provision came before this
 
01:21:00.229 --> 01:21:00.239 align:start position:0%
legislative body I'm not sure if there's
 
01:21:03.510 --> 01:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
another um one this session but there
 
01:21:07.510 --> 01:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
might be next year and I'm on page
 
01:21:10.270 --> 01:21:10.280 align:start position:0%
344 and you'll see it set out on the
 
01:21:13.629 --> 01:21:13.639 align:start position:0%
leand side there 186 col 60 Professional
 
01:21:17.070 --> 01:21:17.080 align:start position:0%
Standards Board very quickly we call it
 
01:21:21.350 --> 01:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
the PSB and it is a body that advises
 
01:21:24.030 --> 01:21:24.040 align:start position:0%
the state board about areas of
 
01:21:26.470 --> 01:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
professional practice for
 
01:21:28.470 --> 01:21:28.480 align:start position:0%
educators and so it's used in our
 
01:21:31.470 --> 01:21:31.480 align:start position:0%
certification Bureau um to make those
 
01:21:33.550 --> 01:21:33.560 align:start position:0%
decisions as to what a certification for
 
01:21:35.669 --> 01:21:35.679 align:start position:0%
a social studies teacher might look like
 
01:21:39.430 --> 01:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
or a math teacher and from time to time
 
01:21:40.830 --> 01:21:40.840 align:start position:0%
the legislature will have the
 
01:21:43.350 --> 01:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity to look
 
01:21:47.070 --> 01:21:47.080 align:start position:0%
at the makeup of the
 
01:21:49.750 --> 01:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
PSB and I think last session there was
 
01:21:52.550 --> 01:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
an addition of Career Technical
 
01:21:54.950 --> 01:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
education and so that's an area that's
 
01:21:57.270 --> 01:21:57.280 align:start position:0%
always kind of growing and changing as
 
01:22:00.390 --> 01:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
the field grows and changes and the PSB
 
01:22:02.950 --> 01:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
keeps Pace with that and advises the
 
01:22:05.350 --> 01:22:05.360 align:start position:0%
certification Bureau of
 
01:22:08.149 --> 01:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
that any questions as we're going along
 
01:22:10.189 --> 01:22:10.199 align:start position:0%
like I said this a very kind of cursory
 
01:22:17.550 --> 01:22:17.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:20.070 --> 01:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
overview special education I know this
 
01:22:23.709 --> 01:22:23.719 align:start position:0%
was talked about on Monday um special
 
01:22:28.790 --> 01:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:33.070 --> 01:22:33.080 align:start position:0%
186c and it is a lengthy area of the
 
01:22:36.870 --> 01:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:42.110 --> 01:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
start on page 351 you'll see the heading
 
01:22:45.149 --> 01:22:45.159 align:start position:0%
of the chapter at the very
 
01:22:49.350 --> 01:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:53.310 --> 01:22:53.320 align:start position:0%
side what I want to highlight for you is
 
01:22:55.390 --> 01:22:55.400 align:start position:0%
that table of content
 
01:22:57.149 --> 01:22:57.159 align:start position:0%
for the start of the chapter so it
 
01:23:00.990 --> 01:23:01.000 align:start position:0%
starts a little bit on page 351 but if
 
01:23:02.470 --> 01:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
you look at
 
01:23:05.470 --> 01:23:05.480 align:start position:0%
352 that table of contents can be very
 
01:23:08.350 --> 01:23:08.360 align:start position:0%
helpful to you to you as a legislator it
 
01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:10.030 align:start position:0%
helpful to you to you as a legislator it
breaks

01:23:10.030 --> 01:23:10.040 align:start position:0%
breaks
 
01:23:13.390 --> 01:23:13.400 align:start position:0%
down all the various headings this is a
 
01:23:15.790 --> 01:23:15.800 align:start position:0%
really good tool for you to use as you
 
01:23:18.669 --> 01:23:18.679 align:start position:0%
dive into special education
 
01:23:22.830 --> 01:23:22.840 align:start position:0%
law because it sets it all right out
 
01:23:25.229 --> 01:23:25.239 align:start position:0%
here and you'll see these little
 
01:23:27.910 --> 01:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
subheadings such as alternative dispute
 
01:23:30.390 --> 01:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
resolution it's bolded you'll find it
 
01:23:32.149 --> 01:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
near the bottom of the column on the
 
01:23:34.990 --> 01:23:35.000 align:start position:0%
leftand side that's kind of like a
 
01:23:37.950 --> 01:23:37.960 align:start position:0%
little subsection within special
 
01:23:40.790 --> 01:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
education you'll also find one for the
 
01:23:43.870 --> 01:23:43.880 align:start position:0%
advocate for special ed education again
 
01:23:46.270 --> 01:23:46.280 align:start position:0%
another little subheading but it tells
 
01:23:49.110 --> 01:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
you how the chapter is
 
01:23:57.629 --> 01:23:57.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:00.870 --> 01:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
couple of things to be aware of in
 
01:24:07.030 --> 01:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:09.390 --> 01:24:09.400 align:start position:0%
definition making special education
 
01:24:12.110 --> 01:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
applicable to ages 3 and 21
 
01:24:14.790 --> 01:24:14.800 align:start position:0%
inclusive from time to time there will
 
01:24:17.709 --> 01:24:17.719 align:start position:0%
be what we call cleanup bills or
 
01:24:19.950 --> 01:24:19.960 align:start position:0%
technical bills where we have found
 
01:24:22.870 --> 01:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
other areas of the law that did not get
 
01:24:25.149 --> 01:24:25.159 align:start position:0%
this new definition
 
01:24:27.030 --> 01:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
and so the department will often times
 
01:24:30.629 --> 01:24:30.639 align:start position:0%
flag those areas bring a request forward
 
01:24:32.629 --> 01:24:32.639 align:start position:0%
to say we need to make sure the
 
01:24:35.070 --> 01:24:35.080 align:start position:0%
definition is consistent in other
 
01:24:37.070 --> 01:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
chapters in other areas of the law
 
01:24:39.070 --> 01:24:39.080 align:start position:0%
that's very common but we call those
 
01:24:42.310 --> 01:24:42.320 align:start position:0%
technical bills or cleanup
 
01:24:44.550 --> 01:24:44.560 align:start position:0%
Bill I know there was also the
 
01:24:48.070 --> 01:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
discussion about catastrophic Aid I know
 
01:24:50.430 --> 01:24:50.440 align:start position:0%
yesterday in the um Committee hearing
 
01:24:53.350 --> 01:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
for representative lad he said I always
 
01:24:55.229 --> 01:24:55.239 align:start position:0%
call it CAD a and now I'm being told not
 
01:24:57.629 --> 01:24:57.639 align:start position:0%
to call it CAD Aid that is true there's
 
01:24:59.790 --> 01:24:59.800 align:start position:0%
a legislative fix to address that it is
 
01:25:02.350 --> 01:25:02.360 align:start position:0%
no longer catastrophic Aid special
 
01:25:10.109 --> 01:25:10.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:12.750 --> 01:25:12.760 align:start position:0%
right we're going to keep moving along
 
01:25:15.510 --> 01:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
in this book and in some ways we're
 
01:25:17.270 --> 01:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
doing this Justice and in other ways
 
01:25:19.390 --> 01:25:19.400 align:start position:0%
you're getting to know the complexity of
 
01:25:22.109 --> 01:25:22.119 align:start position:0%
some of these chapters I would suggest
 
01:25:25.590 --> 01:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
to you as a practical matter
 
01:25:28.990 --> 01:25:29.000 align:start position:0%
these little poits and those tabs that I
 
01:25:30.510 --> 01:25:30.520 align:start position:0%
always used to ignore when i' go into
 
01:25:33.629 --> 01:25:33.639 align:start position:0%
Staples could be very helpful to you
 
01:25:36.109 --> 01:25:36.119 align:start position:0%
when I started in law
 
01:25:38.590 --> 01:25:38.600 align:start position:0%
school these are great because they're
 
01:25:40.950 --> 01:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
going to really help you to just flip to
 
01:25:43.109 --> 01:25:43.119 align:start position:0%
the right page and identify what
 
01:25:45.390 --> 01:25:45.400 align:start position:0%
chapters you're working on as you go
 
01:25:48.870 --> 01:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:51.990 --> 01:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
policym career in technical education
 
01:25:56.109 --> 01:25:56.119 align:start position:0%
CTE again I cannot imagine a legislative
 
01:25:58.910 --> 01:25:58.920 align:start position:0%
session where there is not a proposed
 
01:26:01.430 --> 01:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
bill on CTE so
 
01:26:04.709 --> 01:26:04.719 align:start position:0%
188e is the chapter that governs Career
 
01:26:12.790 --> 01:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:15.709 --> 01:26:15.719 align:start position:0%
education I'll just note that uh most of
 
01:26:18.950 --> 01:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
the CTE bills will be going to the uh
 
01:26:21.430 --> 01:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
other committee that is one of their
 
01:26:25.229 --> 01:26:25.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:28.470 --> 01:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
but it's still good to be able to refer
 
01:27:23.189 --> 01:27:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:25.550 --> 01:27:25.560 align:start position:0%
we talked a little bit about rule
 
01:27:30.149 --> 01:27:30.159 align:start position:0%
making rule making can only be done if
 
01:27:32.669 --> 01:27:32.679 align:start position:0%
it is granted
 
01:27:34.990 --> 01:27:35.000 align:start position:0%
legislatively so when the legislature
 
01:27:38.229 --> 01:27:38.239 align:start position:0%
wants the department to create rules and
 
01:27:39.750 --> 01:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
the way I describe the difference
 
01:27:42.669 --> 01:27:42.679 align:start position:0%
between a statute and the
 
01:27:45.350 --> 01:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
rules is that the statute is kind of the
 
01:27:48.870 --> 01:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
framework of the house if you will right
 
01:27:51.189 --> 01:27:51.199 align:start position:0%
it's the framework of the house and the
 
01:27:55.270 --> 01:27:55.280 align:start position:0%
rules flush it out the rules are the
 
01:27:57.669 --> 01:27:57.679 align:start position:0%
wallpaper and the paint and the
 
01:27:59.750 --> 01:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
carpeting right and so there's a big
 
01:28:01.149 --> 01:28:01.159 align:start position:0%
difference when you're driving to your
 
01:28:03.109 --> 01:28:03.119 align:start position:0%
house and you see someone's building a
 
01:28:05.990 --> 01:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
house and you watch it over time come
 
01:28:08.830 --> 01:28:08.840 align:start position:0%
together you see the framework and then
 
01:28:11.350 --> 01:28:11.360 align:start position:0%
you see the final product and that's how
 
01:28:13.510 --> 01:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
I think about the difference between the
 
01:28:16.910 --> 01:28:16.920 align:start position:0%
law and the rule and if the legislature
 
01:28:19.950 --> 01:28:19.960 align:start position:0%
wants the department and the State Board
 
01:28:22.550 --> 01:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
to engage in rule
 
01:28:26.910 --> 01:28:26.920 align:start position:0%
making 18 a e3 is a really good example
 
01:28:30.870 --> 01:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
of the language to use so first of all
 
01:28:33.669 --> 01:28:33.679 align:start position:0%
you have to the legislature has to say
 
01:28:36.310 --> 01:28:36.320 align:start position:0%
and it's right in paragraph one the
 
01:28:39.790 --> 01:28:39.800 align:start position:0%
State Board shall adopt rules pursuant
 
01:28:41.669 --> 01:28:41.679 align:start position:0%
to RSA
 
01:28:46.950 --> 01:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
541a and RSA 21n 911 a direct citation
 
01:28:49.109 --> 01:28:49.119 align:start position:0%
to the rule making Authority those are
 
01:28:52.229 --> 01:28:52.239 align:start position:0%
the magic words for Ru
 
01:28:55.030 --> 01:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
making but as representative cordelli
 
01:28:57.910 --> 01:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
and I have discussed in the
 
01:29:00.149 --> 01:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
half it
 
01:29:04.270 --> 01:29:04.280 align:start position:0%
is a good practice for the legislature
 
01:29:06.870 --> 01:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
to tell the state board and the
 
01:29:09.629 --> 01:29:09.639 align:start position:0%
department what the rules should
 
01:29:13.270 --> 01:29:13.280 align:start position:0%
cover and this particular statute does a
 
01:29:15.390 --> 01:29:15.400 align:start position:0%
really good job with that because it say
 
01:29:18.229 --> 01:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
it states the rules shall include
 
01:29:20.189 --> 01:29:20.199 align:start position:0%
criteria which guarantee potential
 
01:29:22.070 --> 01:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
sending districts an opportunity to
 
01:29:25.350 --> 01:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
enroll students it gets into the
 
01:29:28.950 --> 01:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
detail of what the legislature is
 
01:29:30.510 --> 01:29:30.520 align:start position:0%
directing the state board and the
 
01:29:32.750 --> 01:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
department to do rulle making
 
01:29:35.709 --> 01:29:35.719 align:start position:0%
on and that is going to make for a very
 
01:29:38.790 --> 01:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
effective rule making there have been
 
01:29:40.910 --> 01:29:40.920 align:start position:0%
other instances where the rul making
 
01:29:45.070 --> 01:29:45.080 align:start position:0%
Authority is listed pursuant to 541a Ru
 
01:29:48.070 --> 01:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
making as it pertains to this chapter
 
01:29:51.550 --> 01:29:51.560 align:start position:0%
that's very general that's very generic
 
01:29:55.070 --> 01:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
and it might not it might not produce
 
01:29:56.990 --> 01:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
what the legislative body is hoping it
 
01:29:59.910 --> 01:29:59.920 align:start position:0%
will produce the more detail that can be
 
01:30:02.390 --> 01:30:02.400 align:start position:0%
given think the better the product will
 
01:30:05.270 --> 01:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
be and so I highlight that for this
 
01:30:07.310 --> 01:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
committee because I think this is a
 
01:30:09.030 --> 01:30:09.040 align:start position:0%
really great
 
01:30:11.070 --> 01:30:11.080 align:start position:0%
example of using that rule making
 
01:30:14.030 --> 01:30:14.040 align:start position:0%
Authority so as you consider these bills
 
01:30:16.070 --> 01:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
keep that in the back of your mind is
 
01:30:17.830 --> 01:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
Rule making
 
01:30:20.590 --> 01:30:20.600 align:start position:0%
Necessary are the directions clear as to
 
01:30:23.270 --> 01:30:23.280 align:start position:0%
what this ruem should cover or is Rule
 
01:30:25.189 --> 01:30:25.199 align:start position:0%
making Necessary do we want to give the
 
01:30:27.310 --> 01:30:27.320 align:start position:0%
department more direction as to what
 
01:30:28.590 --> 01:30:28.600 align:start position:0%
this should look
 
01:30:31.669 --> 01:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
like the other area in this particular
 
01:30:34.550 --> 01:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
chapter that I want to highlight for you
 
01:30:40.910 --> 01:30:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:43.310 --> 01:30:43.320 align:start position:0%
432 that page number reference thing
 
01:30:45.070 --> 01:30:45.080 align:start position:0%
seems to be working quite well I think I
 
01:30:46.790 --> 01:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
like that I might have started a trend
 
01:30:50.229 --> 01:30:50.239 align:start position:0%
here um so at the bottom on the left
 
01:30:53.470 --> 01:30:53.480 align:start position:0%
hand side 188 E8 I'm going to highlight
 
01:30:56.149 --> 01:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
this for you you you'll see some
 
01:31:02.109 --> 01:31:02.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:06.270 --> 01:31:06.280 align:start position:0%
brackets anytime something is in italics
 
01:31:09.310 --> 01:31:09.320 align:start position:0%
and brackets in the world of law it's
 
01:31:12.030 --> 01:31:12.040 align:start position:0%
really important right there was a joke
 
01:31:13.750 --> 01:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
in law school once that in your normal
 
01:31:15.790 --> 01:31:15.800 align:start position:0%
life you don't read footnotes but in law
 
01:31:17.950 --> 01:31:17.960 align:start position:0%
school you do it's kind of the same
 
01:31:21.070 --> 01:31:21.080 align:start position:0%
thing here take a look at that language
 
01:31:22.629 --> 01:31:22.639 align:start position:0%
and it's telling you that this
 
01:31:24.550 --> 01:31:24.560 align:start position:0%
particular provision is is effective
 
01:31:27.270 --> 01:31:27.280 align:start position:0%
until a certain date and
 
01:31:30.470 --> 01:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
time and after that you have a whole new
 
01:31:33.149 --> 01:31:33.159 align:start position:0%
section and you find it on the next
 
01:31:35.470 --> 01:31:35.480 align:start position:0%
column so depending on when you're
 
01:31:38.669 --> 01:31:38.679 align:start position:0%
reading this one of them is effective
 
01:31:41.070 --> 01:31:41.080 align:start position:0%
and the other one is not and that can
 
01:31:42.709 --> 01:31:42.719 align:start position:0%
become very
 
01:31:45.830 --> 01:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
critical also critical when you see that
 
01:31:48.750 --> 01:31:48.760 align:start position:0%
as to when the effective date is so when
 
01:31:51.350 --> 01:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
you're considering bills think about
 
01:32:02.709 --> 01:32:02.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:06.390 --> 01:32:06.400 align:start position:0%
in we're now going to turn to
 
01:32:08.550 --> 01:32:08.560 align:start position:0%
189 and
 
01:32:10.830 --> 01:32:10.840 align:start position:0%
189 is a pretty
 
01:32:12.950 --> 01:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
significant chapter on school
 
01:32:14.709 --> 01:32:14.719 align:start position:0%
administrations and I'm just going to
 
01:32:16.910 --> 01:32:16.920 align:start position:0%
highlight a couple of key
 
01:32:24.750 --> 01:32:24.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:28.590 --> 01:32:28.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:31.790 --> 01:32:31.800 align:start position:0%
485 but really you'll find it on page
 
01:32:35.510 --> 01:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
486 uh again I cannot think of a
 
01:32:37.510 --> 01:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
legislative session that did not
 
01:32:41.030 --> 01:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
consider uh 18911 instruction in
 
01:32:42.669 --> 01:32:42.679 align:start position:0%
National and State history government
 
01:32:42.679 --> 01:32:43.550 align:start position:0%
National and State history government
and

01:32:43.550 --> 01:32:43.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:32:45.910 --> 01:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
Civics I would be surprised if there was
 
01:32:48.390 --> 01:32:48.400 align:start position:0%
not another bill put forward that is an
 
01:32:53.149 --> 01:32:53.159 align:start position:0%
area um that is always up for debate in
 
01:32:56.709 --> 01:32:56.719 align:start position:0%
this legisl body often will look at that
 
01:32:58.750 --> 01:32:58.760 align:start position:0%
address some areas that need some
 
01:33:03.470 --> 01:33:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:06.189 --> 01:33:06.199 align:start position:0%
section the department also does and
 
01:33:08.310 --> 01:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
we'll take a look at this but we do a
 
01:33:10.070 --> 01:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
lot of technical
 
01:33:13.030 --> 01:33:13.040 align:start position:0%
advisory as the laws change and this is
 
01:33:17.229 --> 01:33:17.239 align:start position:0%
an area that we will often uh draft and
 
01:33:21.950 --> 01:33:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:24.750 --> 01:33:24.760 align:start position:0%
on I also want to bring your
 
01:33:26.790 --> 01:33:26.800 align:start position:0%
attention to
 
01:33:29.189 --> 01:33:29.199 align:start position:0%
18913a and you're going to find that on
 
01:33:29.199 --> 01:33:38.229 align:start position:0%
18913a and you're going to find that on
page

01:33:38.229 --> 01:33:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:41.070 --> 01:33:41.080 align:start position:0%
491 there's three areas to be aware of
 
01:33:47.390 --> 01:33:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:55.990 --> 01:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:59.229 --> 01:33:59.239 align:start position:0%
1891 13B is on
 
01:33:59.239 --> 01:34:00.790 align:start position:0%
1891 13B is on
495

01:34:00.790 --> 01:34:00.800 align:start position:0%
495
 
01:34:04.550 --> 01:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
and 8913 C is also on the very bottom of
 
01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:08.750 align:start position:0%
and 8913 C is also on the very bottom of
that

01:34:08.750 --> 01:34:08.760 align:start position:0%

page
 
01:34:15.350 --> 01:34:15.360 align:start position:0%
18913a talks about employment and
 
01:34:18.229 --> 01:34:18.239 align:start position:0%
background checks for teachers and
 
01:34:22.109 --> 01:34:22.119 align:start position:0%
Volunteers in school districts charter
 
01:34:26.070 --> 01:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:28.229 align:start position:0%
 
cies

01:34:28.229 --> 01:34:28.239 align:start position:0%
cies

01:34:35.550 --> 01:34:35.560 align:start position:0%
employment so when an educator is hired
 
01:34:37.030 --> 01:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
by a school
 
01:34:39.310 --> 01:34:39.320 align:start position:0%
district they are subject to a criminal
 
01:34:43.669 --> 01:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
background check and according to this
 
01:34:46.229 --> 01:34:46.239 align:start position:0%
chapter the school district reviews that
 
01:34:47.550 --> 01:34:47.560 align:start position:0%
criminal history
 
01:34:51.310 --> 01:34:51.320 align:start position:0%
record there are a list of criminal
 
01:34:53.750 --> 01:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
offenses that would prohibit someone
 
01:34:55.870 --> 01:34:55.880 align:start position:0%
from working as an educator anywhere in
 
01:34:55.880 --> 01:34:56.629 align:start position:0%
from working as an educator anywhere in
the

01:34:56.629 --> 01:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:34:59.790 --> 01:34:59.800 align:start position:0%
state those offenses are
 
01:35:02.709 --> 01:35:02.719 align:start position:0%
found on the bottom of page
 
01:35:07.070 --> 01:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
492 in section five Roman numeral five
 
01:35:10.590 --> 01:35:10.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:13.030 --> 01:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
provision because of the placement in
 
01:35:17.470 --> 01:35:17.480 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral 5 the shorthand is we call
 
01:35:20.709 --> 01:35:20.719 align:start position:0%
them the section five violations it's
 
01:35:22.709 --> 01:35:22.719 align:start position:0%
not because there's five violations it's
 
01:35:25.270 --> 01:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
because they're in Roman numeral 5 when
 
01:35:28.470 --> 01:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
you look at Roman numeral 5 those
 
01:35:30.830 --> 01:35:30.840 align:start position:0%
criminal offenses are all listed by
 
01:35:33.870 --> 01:35:33.880 align:start position:0%
Statute number they're not written out
 
01:35:37.070 --> 01:35:37.080 align:start position:0%
as to what those offenses
 
01:35:40.709 --> 01:35:40.719 align:start position:0%
are I'll be very plain about it this is
 
01:35:40.719 --> 01:35:41.590 align:start position:0%
are I'll be very plain about it this is
not

01:35:41.590 --> 01:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:35:45.629 --> 01:35:45.639 align:start position:0%
helpful this just adds a layer of
 
01:35:47.669 --> 01:35:47.679 align:start position:0%
complication I took a look at this
 
01:35:49.870 --> 01:35:49.880 align:start position:0%
chapter and thought oh good lord I don't
 
01:35:52.629 --> 01:35:52.639 align:start position:0%
even know what those are so I wrote them
 
01:35:55.310 --> 01:35:55.320 align:start position:0%
down because I'm a big fan of knowing
 
01:35:57.189 --> 01:35:57.199 align:start position:0%
what I'm talking about and having the
 
01:36:00.229 --> 01:36:00.239 align:start position:0%
little cheat sheet so I know somewhere
 
01:36:03.629 --> 01:36:03.639 align:start position:0%
Jen yeah you already have the gch
 
01:36:05.950 --> 01:36:05.960 align:start position:0%
perfect those are the list of all the
 
01:36:07.990 --> 01:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
offenses that would prohibit someone
 
01:36:09.669 --> 01:36:09.679 align:start position:0%
from working in a
 
01:36:09.679 --> 01:36:13.830 align:start position:0%
from working in a
school

01:36:13.830 --> 01:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:16.350 --> 01:36:16.360 align:start position:0%
Statewide from time to time the
 
01:36:17.830 --> 01:36:17.840 align:start position:0%
department has worked with this
 
01:36:20.870 --> 01:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
committee to add to that
 
01:36:24.229 --> 01:36:24.239 align:start position:0%
list I'm not aware of any um proposed
 
01:36:27.270 --> 01:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
changes for this legislative SE
 
01:36:30.149 --> 01:36:30.159 align:start position:0%
session but it is not unheard of that
 
01:36:31.830 --> 01:36:31.840 align:start position:0%
the department will come forward with
 
01:36:33.229 --> 01:36:33.239 align:start position:0%
that with that
 
01:36:36.390 --> 01:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
request interestingly enough while those
 
01:36:38.229 --> 01:36:38.239 align:start position:0%
disqualifying offenses and that's
 
01:36:39.550 --> 01:36:39.560 align:start position:0%
exactly what they are they are
 
01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:40.910 align:start position:0%
exactly what they are they are
disqualifying

01:36:40.910 --> 01:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
disqualifying
 
01:36:43.030 --> 01:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
offenses a school
 
01:36:46.430 --> 01:36:46.440 align:start position:0%
district can take into account any
 
01:36:49.550 --> 01:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
offense that's on an individual's record
 
01:36:51.229 --> 01:36:51.239 align:start position:0%
they have an enormous amount of
 
01:36:53.149 --> 01:36:53.159 align:start position:0%
discretion to say what is the right fit
 
01:36:55.669 --> 01:36:55.679 align:start position:0%
for our classroom what is the right fit
 
01:36:56.950 --> 01:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
for this
 
01:37:00.590 --> 01:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
job that is in sharp contrast
 
01:37:03.229 --> 01:37:03.239 align:start position:0%
however to the Department's
 
01:37:05.550 --> 01:37:05.560 align:start position:0%
Authority when the department does a
 
01:37:08.430 --> 01:37:08.440 align:start position:0%
background check on a individual who
 
01:37:10.790 --> 01:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
wants a license to teach and you're
 
01:37:12.550 --> 01:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
going to find that in
 
01:37:12.560 --> 01:37:15.750 align:start position:0%
going to find that in
18913

01:37:15.750 --> 01:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:19.270 --> 01:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
C the department has authority to do a
 
01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:20.310 align:start position:0%
C the department has authority to do a
background

01:37:20.310 --> 01:37:20.320 align:start position:0%
background
 
01:37:23.669 --> 01:37:23.679 align:start position:0%
check on an applicant to teach so so
 
01:37:25.070 --> 01:37:25.080 align:start position:0%
that's either someone from a teacher
 
01:37:27.189 --> 01:37:27.199 align:start position:0%
prep program or someone from out of
 
01:37:29.229 --> 01:37:29.239 align:start position:0%
state who is now seeking to teach here
 
01:37:31.910 --> 01:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire the department will run
 
01:37:33.629 --> 01:37:33.639 align:start position:0%
a background
 
01:37:37.790 --> 01:37:37.800 align:start position:0%
check um and if that individual has one
 
01:37:40.430 --> 01:37:40.440 align:start position:0%
of those section five violations on
 
01:37:42.510 --> 01:37:42.520 align:start position:0%
their record they're not granted a
 
01:37:44.950 --> 01:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
license if there's anything else on that
 
01:37:47.430 --> 01:37:47.440 align:start position:0%
record the department does not have
 
01:37:50.270 --> 01:37:50.280 align:start position:0%
discretion to say well maybe we should
 
01:37:51.950 --> 01:37:51.960 align:start position:0%
still go ahead with it or maybe this
 
01:37:53.669 --> 01:37:53.679 align:start position:0%
person's not qualified we do not have
 
01:37:56.189 --> 01:37:56.199 align:start position:0%
that discretion we leave that discretion
 
01:37:58.669 --> 01:37:58.679 align:start position:0%
to to the individual
 
01:38:04.030 --> 01:38:04.040 align:start position:0%
districts but these two sections 189 13B
 
01:38:06.950 --> 01:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
and 13 C were created by this
 
01:38:10.470 --> 01:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
legislative body in the last 8 n 10
 
01:38:13.510 --> 01:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
years and the reason for that was we
 
01:38:16.270 --> 01:38:16.280 align:start position:0%
were recognizing that the department had
 
01:38:19.390 --> 01:38:19.400 align:start position:0%
to play a role
 
01:38:22.589 --> 01:38:22.599 align:start position:0%
in assessing whether someone should be
 
01:38:25.310 --> 01:38:25.320 align:start position:0%
granted a license to teach um and the
 
01:38:28.709 --> 01:38:28.719 align:start position:0%
decision was made that if someone wasn't
 
01:38:31.709 --> 01:38:31.719 align:start position:0%
employable they didn't pass the section
 
01:38:34.310 --> 01:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
five test if they were not employable
 
01:38:35.990 --> 01:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
the department shouldn't license them
 
01:38:38.350 --> 01:38:38.360 align:start position:0%
because turning them out to the field
 
01:38:40.070 --> 01:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
was not helping the
 
01:38:42.790 --> 01:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
field but that was a policy debate that
 
01:38:45.629 --> 01:38:45.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:47.830 --> 01:38:47.840 align:start position:0%
committee I don't want to glance over
 
01:38:51.950 --> 01:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
1891 13B so that allows the department
 
01:38:54.109 --> 01:38:54.119 align:start position:0%
to do the background check for school
 
01:38:54.119 --> 01:38:55.310 align:start position:0%
to do the background check for school
bus

01:38:55.310 --> 01:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
bus
 
01:38:58.149 --> 01:38:58.159 align:start position:0%
drivers you probably uh are familiar
 
01:39:00.310 --> 01:39:00.320 align:start position:0%
that we had and probably still have a
 
01:39:01.709 --> 01:39:01.719 align:start position:0%
school bus
 
01:39:04.310 --> 01:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
shortage and one of the reasons for that
 
01:39:07.070 --> 01:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
was that they were background checked
 
01:39:10.270 --> 01:39:10.280 align:start position:0%
for employment purposes that limited and
 
01:39:12.310 --> 01:39:12.320 align:start position:0%
forgive the pun but that limited their
 
01:39:15.589 --> 01:39:15.599 align:start position:0%
Mobility to go and work for another
 
01:39:19.229 --> 01:39:19.239 align:start position:0%
district and so we housed it with the
 
01:39:22.070 --> 01:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Education they get
 
01:39:23.950 --> 01:39:23.960 align:start position:0%
licensed to drive a bus with the
 
01:39:25.470 --> 01:39:25.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Motor
 
01:39:27.510 --> 01:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
Vehicles and then the department of
 
01:39:29.629 --> 01:39:29.639 align:start position:0%
education does that background
 
01:39:33.470 --> 01:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
check the way that I remember it
 
01:39:35.910 --> 01:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
18913a deals with
 
01:39:38.390 --> 01:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
employment employment school districts
 
01:39:43.669 --> 01:39:43.679 align:start position:0%
all that 18913 b b for bus
 
01:39:47.870 --> 01:39:47.880 align:start position:0%
driver and 18913 C for
 
01:39:49.910 --> 01:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
credentialing that's the easiest way to
 
01:39:54.589 --> 01:39:54.599 align:start position:0%
recall that those sections all overlap
 
01:39:56.790 --> 01:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
they all reference the same list of
 
01:39:59.790 --> 01:39:59.800 align:start position:0%
disqualifying offenses those section
 
01:39:59.800 --> 01:40:02.390 align:start position:0%
disqualifying offenses those section
five

01:40:02.390 --> 01:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:05.149 --> 01:40:05.159 align:start position:0%
violations but the implications of them
 
01:40:09.070 --> 01:40:09.080 align:start position:0%
can be very different from employment to
 
01:40:12.669 --> 01:40:12.679 align:start position:0%
lure any questions on that yes dang in
 
01:40:14.990 --> 01:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
it so if the if the department is going
 
01:40:17.709 --> 01:40:17.719 align:start position:0%
to do credentialing and do the criminal
 
01:40:19.149 --> 01:40:19.159 align:start position:0%
background check and find that they
 
01:40:21.270 --> 01:40:21.280 align:start position:0%
shouldn't get their credential yeah they
 
01:40:24.589 --> 01:40:24.599 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be even getting as far is
 
01:40:26.430 --> 01:40:26.440 align:start position:0%
possibly being hired by a school
 
01:40:27.750 --> 01:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
district because they won't have a
 
01:40:30.589 --> 01:40:30.599 align:start position:0%
credential anyway correct that's that's
 
01:40:32.910 --> 01:40:32.920 align:start position:0%
correct yes okay yeah and the the idea
 
01:40:34.950 --> 01:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
and thank you for the
 
01:40:37.189 --> 01:40:37.199 align:start position:0%
question the idea was that the
 
01:40:38.910 --> 01:40:38.920 align:start position:0%
department was not doing a background
 
01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:40.589 align:start position:0%
department was not doing a background
check

01:40:40.589 --> 01:40:40.599 align:start position:0%
check
 
01:40:43.470 --> 01:40:43.480 align:start position:0%
historically and so they would license
 
01:40:45.950 --> 01:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
the individual not run the background
 
01:40:47.830 --> 01:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
check and then that person would apply
 
01:40:49.629 --> 01:40:49.639 align:start position:0%
to a school district and the school
 
01:40:52.430 --> 01:40:52.440 align:start position:0%
district would then find out well
 
01:40:55.390 --> 01:40:55.400 align:start position:0%
they're not employable and so as a
 
01:40:58.229 --> 01:40:58.239 align:start position:0%
policy matter the department came before
 
01:41:00.750 --> 01:41:00.760 align:start position:0%
this legislative body and said we would
 
01:41:02.830 --> 01:41:02.840 align:start position:0%
like to change that moving forward
 
01:41:05.149 --> 01:41:05.159 align:start position:0%
policy-wise the department did not want
 
01:41:08.470 --> 01:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
to license individuals who were
 
01:41:10.669 --> 01:41:10.679 align:start position:0%
unemployable we didn't see that as a
 
01:41:13.310 --> 01:41:13.320 align:start position:0%
benefit to to the
 
01:41:15.430 --> 01:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
districts however there was a lot of
 
01:41:17.310 --> 01:41:17.320 align:start position:0%
policy debate as to what role the
 
01:41:20.109 --> 01:41:20.119 align:start position:0%
department would play in that and the
 
01:41:21.990 --> 01:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
decision ultimately was that the
 
01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:23.990 align:start position:0%
decision ultimately was that the
department

01:41:23.990 --> 01:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:41:26.830 --> 01:41:26.840 align:start position:0%
was stuck with those not stuck with but
 
01:41:28.669 --> 01:41:28.679 align:start position:0%
could only run for and check for the
 
01:41:31.589 --> 01:41:31.599 align:start position:0%
section five disqualifying offenses and
 
01:41:34.270 --> 01:41:34.280 align:start position:0%
has no discretion as it pertains to
 
01:41:36.750 --> 01:41:36.760 align:start position:0%
other offenses and the discretion is
 
01:41:39.990 --> 01:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:43.390 --> 01:41:43.400 align:start position:0%
districts yes thank you attorney Fon can
 
01:41:47.270 --> 01:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
you refresh me on the student teaching
 
01:41:50.430 --> 01:41:50.440 align:start position:0%
uh certification when the the schools do
 
01:41:53.629 --> 01:41:53.639 align:start position:0%
that credentialing applicants yes yes so
 
01:41:55.830 --> 01:41:55.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so that's
 
01:41:58.550 --> 01:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
governed in 18913
 
01:42:00.830 --> 01:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
C and you'll see the definition
 
01:42:05.350 --> 01:42:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:08.910 --> 01:42:08.920 align:start position:0%
candidate and I don't want to get too
 
01:42:11.830 --> 01:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
far into the weeds
 
01:42:14.550 --> 01:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
um but the history of it and I think
 
01:42:16.669 --> 01:42:16.679 align:start position:0%
this is what you're
 
01:42:20.790 --> 01:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
referencing is there was a time where if
 
01:42:24.229 --> 01:42:24.239 align:start position:0%
we say St anam's College St a
 
01:42:26.109 --> 01:42:26.119 align:start position:0%
they would have a teacher prep
 
01:42:26.119 --> 01:42:27.750 align:start position:0%
they would have a teacher prep
program

01:42:27.750 --> 01:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:42:30.470 --> 01:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
and they would background check the
 
01:42:32.229 --> 01:42:32.239 align:start position:0%
students and then those students as part
 
01:42:34.390 --> 01:42:34.400 align:start position:0%
of that teacher prep program would go
 
01:42:36.270 --> 01:42:36.280 align:start position:0%
into a multitude of schools around the
 
01:42:40.189 --> 01:42:40.199 align:start position:0%
districts for observation or Hands-On
 
01:42:43.910 --> 01:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
work anything in this area that deals
 
01:42:46.350 --> 01:42:46.360 align:start position:0%
with criminal background
 
01:42:48.709 --> 01:42:48.719 align:start position:0%
checks doesn't just fall within the
 
01:42:50.950 --> 01:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
purview of the Department of Education
 
01:42:53.189 --> 01:42:53.199 align:start position:0%
there is significant overlap with the
 
01:42:54.510 --> 01:42:54.520 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
01:42:57.310 --> 01:42:57.320 align:start position:0%
Safety and you'll recall that from prior
 
01:43:00.350 --> 01:43:00.360 align:start position:0%
legislative years where I will testify
 
01:43:02.070 --> 01:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
and then someone with a badge and a gun
 
01:43:03.709 --> 01:43:03.719 align:start position:0%
and a really cool hat will come and
 
01:43:06.510 --> 01:43:06.520 align:start position:0%
testify from the Department of Safety
 
01:43:08.629 --> 01:43:08.639 align:start position:0%
there's overlap and the reason there's
 
01:43:10.830 --> 01:43:10.840 align:start position:0%
overlap is the Department of Education
 
01:43:13.669 --> 01:43:13.679 align:start position:0%
does not have we don't have access to
 
01:43:16.669 --> 01:43:16.679 align:start position:0%
nor do we house an individual's criminal
 
01:43:21.270 --> 01:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
record that in that information is
 
01:43:24.709 --> 01:43:24.719 align:start position:0%
exclusively with the Department of
 
01:43:27.510 --> 01:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
safety what happened with the teacher
 
01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:29.550 align:start position:0%
safety what happened with the teacher
prep

01:43:29.550 --> 01:43:29.560 align:start position:0%
prep
 
01:43:32.229 --> 01:43:32.239 align:start position:0%
programs is the Department of Safety was
 
01:43:34.990 --> 01:43:35.000 align:start position:0%
told by the
 
01:43:40.629 --> 01:43:40.639 align:start position:0%
FBI you cannot release the federal the
 
01:43:43.149 --> 01:43:43.159 align:start position:0%
the federal background check to a
 
01:43:43.159 --> 01:43:45.470 align:start position:0%
the federal background check to a
non-governmental

01:43:45.470 --> 01:43:45.480 align:start position:0%
non-governmental
 
01:43:48.270 --> 01:43:48.280 align:start position:0%
entity that was the history that's what
 
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
kind of caused the snag here um because
 
01:43:54.709 --> 01:43:54.719 align:start position:0%
St a is
 
01:43:57.310 --> 01:43:57.320 align:start position:0%
private and while they could get an
 
01:44:00.070 --> 01:44:00.080 align:start position:0%
individual state record the New
 
01:44:02.109 --> 01:44:02.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire record they could not get that
 
01:44:04.589 --> 01:44:04.599 align:start position:0%
federal background check and without the
 
01:44:06.030 --> 01:44:06.040 align:start position:0%
federal background
 
01:44:08.870 --> 01:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
check that's a big piece of information
 
01:44:12.750 --> 01:44:12.760 align:start position:0%
that might be missing some critical
 
01:44:14.790 --> 01:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
information so when the department
 
01:44:16.109 --> 01:44:16.119 align:start position:0%
looked at this and worked with our
 
01:44:18.870 --> 01:44:18.880 align:start position:0%
partners at the department of
 
01:44:22.189 --> 01:44:22.199 align:start position:0%
safety we realized that we are a
 
01:44:23.950 --> 01:44:23.960 align:start position:0%
governmental entity
 
01:44:26.790 --> 01:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
we can receive the federal background
 
01:44:30.910 --> 01:44:30.920 align:start position:0%
check and so we worked with um the
 
01:44:33.189 --> 01:44:33.199 align:start position:0%
chacher prep programs to say we will
 
01:44:36.870 --> 01:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
take on that role we can background
 
01:44:39.109 --> 01:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
check these individuals and then they
 
01:44:40.910 --> 01:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
can participate in this program and go
 
01:44:43.030 --> 01:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
into this various
 
01:44:46.270 --> 01:44:46.280 align:start position:0%
schools now the individual schools can
 
01:44:48.669 --> 01:44:48.679 align:start position:0%
also say we would like a background
 
01:44:52.109 --> 01:44:52.119 align:start position:0%
check that's well within their right but
 
01:44:53.990 --> 01:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the the history it's
 
01:44:56.229 --> 01:44:56.239 align:start position:0%
probably you're probably recalling it as
 
01:44:59.189 --> 01:44:59.199 align:start position:0%
we're going through it thank but that's
 
01:45:01.910 --> 01:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
that's the issue there so anything that
 
01:45:04.510 --> 01:45:04.520 align:start position:0%
deals with this area the department
 
01:45:08.109 --> 01:45:08.119 align:start position:0%
cannot speak to this issue alone because
 
01:45:09.750 --> 01:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
the department of safety has to have a
 
01:45:11.910 --> 01:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
voice in that right anything with
 
01:45:14.189 --> 01:45:14.199 align:start position:0%
background checks and we found that as
 
01:45:18.070 --> 01:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
well um with doing a background check on
 
01:45:20.550 --> 01:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
educational surrogates and educational
 
01:45:23.950 --> 01:45:23.960 align:start position:0%
surrogates are part of special ed law
 
01:45:26.270 --> 01:45:26.280 align:start position:0%
so we go back to
 
01:45:29.550 --> 01:45:29.560 align:start position:0%
186c we're in a whole different chapter
 
01:45:31.709 --> 01:45:31.719 align:start position:0%
and yet we still have to work with the
 
01:45:33.589 --> 01:45:33.599 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety to say how do we
 
01:45:35.830 --> 01:45:35.840 align:start position:0%
background check successfully background
 
01:45:38.149 --> 01:45:38.159 align:start position:0%
check our educational
 
01:45:40.550 --> 01:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
surrogates what's so interesting as you
 
01:45:44.229 --> 01:45:44.239 align:start position:0%
look at this law book is the inherent
 
01:45:46.669 --> 01:45:46.679 align:start position:0%
Crossover with all these different areas
 
01:45:49.430 --> 01:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
of the law so you look at
 
01:45:52.990 --> 01:45:53.000 align:start position:0%
them in an island a little bit but the
 
01:45:56.189 --> 01:45:56.199 align:start position:0%
reality is there's just inherent
 
01:46:00.470 --> 01:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
crossover I think that's fascinating but
 
01:46:02.950 --> 01:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
I this is probably why no one hangs out
 
01:46:04.709 --> 01:46:04.719 align:start position:0%
with me so there you
 
01:46:08.030 --> 01:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
go I think it's cool um just as a little
 
01:46:10.350 --> 01:46:10.360 align:start position:0%
side note uh legislatively some of the
 
01:46:11.950 --> 01:46:11.960 align:start position:0%
things the department has successfully
 
01:46:14.669 --> 01:46:14.679 align:start position:0%
worked with this body to do is the
 
01:46:17.990 --> 01:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
department also now um before it issues
 
01:46:20.189 --> 01:46:20.199 align:start position:0%
a license to an individual to
 
01:46:23.510 --> 01:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
teach the department does a check of the
 
01:46:26.189 --> 01:46:26.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire DCF division of children
 
01:46:28.550 --> 01:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
youth and families their central
 
01:46:31.030 --> 01:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
registry to make sure that individual
 
01:46:34.070 --> 01:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
does not have a finding of
 
01:46:37.149 --> 01:46:37.159 align:start position:0%
abuse not neglect but just abuse that
 
01:46:39.430 --> 01:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
was a policy
 
01:46:42.189 --> 01:46:42.199 align:start position:0%
determination that the the department in
 
01:46:45.310 --> 01:46:45.320 align:start position:0%
this legislative body if some if an
 
01:46:49.189 --> 01:46:49.199 align:start position:0%
individual had a finding of abuse by
 
01:46:51.830 --> 01:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
DCF the decision was made that the
 
01:46:53.430 --> 01:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Education
 
01:46:56.790 --> 01:46:56.800 align:start position:0%
was not to license that individual and
 
01:46:58.950 --> 01:46:58.960 align:start position:0%
provide them access to children but that
 
01:47:01.470 --> 01:47:01.480 align:start position:0%
was a legislative decision and that is
 
01:47:03.390 --> 01:47:03.400 align:start position:0%
found in the
 
01:47:03.400 --> 01:47:05.229 align:start position:0%
found in the
laws

01:47:05.229 --> 01:47:05.239 align:start position:0%
laws
 
01:47:07.550 --> 01:47:07.560 align:start position:0%
additionally there is
 
01:47:10.270 --> 01:47:10.280 align:start position:0%
aou which is a memorandum of
 
01:47:12.589 --> 01:47:12.599 align:start position:0%
understanding and that's a very common
 
01:47:14.390 --> 01:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
term in state
 
01:47:17.229 --> 01:47:17.239 align:start position:0%
governmentus memorandum of understanding
 
01:47:19.430 --> 01:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
um the Department of Education has a
 
01:47:23.470 --> 01:47:23.480 align:start position:0%
number of M with DHHS Department of
 
01:47:25.189 --> 01:47:25.199 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services because
 
01:47:27.470 --> 01:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
there's an enormous amount of crossover
 
01:47:30.229 --> 01:47:30.239 align:start position:0%
between the Department of Education and
 
01:47:33.510 --> 01:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
DHHS but more to the point the
 
01:47:35.750 --> 01:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Education wanted to expand
 
01:47:37.310 --> 01:47:37.320 align:start position:0%
the ability to check the central
 
01:47:39.750 --> 01:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
registry we wanted to be able to check
 
01:47:39.760 --> 01:47:41.550 align:start position:0%
registry we wanted to be able to check
in

01:47:41.550 --> 01:47:41.560 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:47:44.270 --> 01:47:44.280 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts it is no secret that
 
01:47:47.310 --> 01:47:47.320 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of crossover employment
 
01:47:48.950 --> 01:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
wise New Hampshire sends a lot of
 
01:47:50.910 --> 01:47:50.920 align:start position:0%
Educators to Massachusetts and vice
 
01:47:53.470 --> 01:47:53.480 align:start position:0%
versa so we we worked with this
 
01:47:56.229 --> 01:47:56.239 align:start position:0%
legislative body to create a law that
 
01:47:58.149 --> 01:47:58.159 align:start position:0%
allows a
 
01:48:01.470 --> 01:48:01.480 align:start position:0%
department within the parameters of a an
 
01:48:05.669 --> 01:48:05.679 align:start position:0%
anou to check the Massachusetts central
 
01:48:09.510 --> 01:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
registry they call their division um DCF
 
01:48:12.070 --> 01:48:12.080 align:start position:0%
division CH Children and Families just a
 
01:48:14.550 --> 01:48:14.560 align:start position:0%
little different vernacular than in New
 
01:48:16.750 --> 01:48:16.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but those were all done
 
01:48:18.830 --> 01:48:18.840 align:start position:0%
legislatively working with the
 
01:48:21.390 --> 01:48:21.400 align:start position:0%
department and this legislative
 
01:48:25.990 --> 01:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
body any questions on on this area
 
01:48:36.189 --> 01:48:36.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:38.830 --> 01:48:38.840 align:start position:0%
quickly again very quickly this is the
 
01:48:42.109 --> 01:48:42.119 align:start position:0%
10,000 F foot overview um just based on
 
01:48:43.430 --> 01:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
my experience and working with
 
01:48:45.709 --> 01:48:45.719 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli as to the areas
 
01:48:48.709 --> 01:48:48.719 align:start position:0%
we believe um you will see with the
 
01:48:52.910 --> 01:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:52.920 --> 01:49:03.310 align:start position:0%
 
is

01:49:03.310 --> 01:49:03.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:05.550 --> 01:49:05.560 align:start position:0%
1933 and
 
01:49:19.550 --> 01:49:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:22.149 --> 01:49:22.159 align:start position:0%
537 and its change of school or
 
01:49:22.159 --> 01:49:23.470 align:start position:0%
537 and its change of school or
assignment

01:49:23.470 --> 01:49:23.480 align:start position:0%
assignment
 
01:49:25.790 --> 01:49:25.800 align:start position:0%
and it's called best interest of student
 
01:49:28.430 --> 01:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
that's the title of it but when you read
 
01:49:32.189 --> 01:49:32.199 align:start position:0%
through it it's best interest in
 
01:49:34.629 --> 01:49:34.639 align:start position:0%
manifest educational
 
01:49:36.990 --> 01:49:37.000 align:start position:0%
hardship and that term manifest
 
01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:38.310 align:start position:0%
hardship and that term manifest
educational

01:49:38.310 --> 01:49:38.320 align:start position:0%
educational
 
01:49:41.310 --> 01:49:41.320 align:start position:0%
hardship is a critical term to know it's
 
01:49:42.950 --> 01:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
interesting that it's not in the title
 
01:49:45.830 --> 01:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
of the bill but that's what this law
 
01:49:48.350 --> 01:49:48.360 align:start position:0%
really talks
 
01:49:51.390 --> 01:49:51.400 align:start position:0%
about and it is a rare occasion when
 
01:49:54.950 --> 01:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
this legislative body does not consider
 
01:49:59.030 --> 01:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
1933 1933 has been looked at worked on
 
01:50:01.669 --> 01:50:01.679 align:start position:0%
and expanded over over the years quite a
 
01:50:04.790 --> 01:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
bit it is worth taking a look at
 
01:50:07.470 --> 01:50:07.480 align:start position:0%
1933 I will never be an advocate for
 
01:50:09.229 --> 01:50:09.239 align:start position:0%
anyone taking this book home and reading
 
01:50:11.310 --> 01:50:11.320 align:start position:0%
it cover to cover that's just not a good
 
01:50:13.790 --> 01:50:13.800 align:start position:0%
use of your time uh the only person who
 
01:50:17.109 --> 01:50:17.119 align:start position:0%
does that is me but I would
 
01:50:20.350 --> 01:50:20.360 align:start position:0%
suggest prior to considering a bill that
 
01:50:24.189 --> 01:50:24.199 align:start position:0%
amends 1933 that you read over
 
01:50:27.030 --> 01:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
1933 it's worth looking at at what it
 
01:50:29.430 --> 01:50:29.440 align:start position:0%
covers and what it says because it has
 
01:50:33.350 --> 01:50:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:37.070 --> 01:50:37.080 align:start position:0%
bit but when you hear that term manifest
 
01:50:38.830 --> 01:50:38.840 align:start position:0%
educational hardship and it's a common
 
01:50:42.470 --> 01:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
term they're referring to 1933 even
 
01:51:00.109 --> 01:51:00.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:02.030 --> 01:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
while we're in this chapter it's also
 
01:51:03.669 --> 01:51:03.679 align:start position:0%
worth just highlighting for your
 
01:51:03.679 --> 01:51:05.310 align:start position:0%
worth just highlighting for your
reference

01:51:05.310 --> 01:51:05.320 align:start position:0%
reference
 
01:51:07.950 --> 01:51:07.960 align:start position:0%
19313 which is the suspension and
 
01:51:12.270 --> 01:51:12.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:16.750 --> 01:51:16.760 align:start position:0%
pupils this is not an area that's
 
01:51:18.870 --> 01:51:18.880 align:start position:0%
addressed all the time by this
 
01:51:21.550 --> 01:51:21.560 align:start position:0%
legislative body but I do recall a few
 
01:51:24.430 --> 01:51:24.440 align:start position:0%
sessions ago that there was an amendment
 
01:51:24.440 --> 01:51:26.910 align:start position:0%
sessions ago that there was an amendment
to

01:51:26.910 --> 01:51:26.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:30.350 --> 01:51:30.360 align:start position:0%
19313 it's a very complex area and I
 
01:51:32.390 --> 01:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
just flag it for your attention on the
 
01:51:34.270 --> 01:51:34.280 align:start position:0%
off chance that is brought before you in
 
01:52:04.510 --> 01:52:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:17.669 --> 01:52:17.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:20.790 --> 01:52:20.800 align:start position:0%
600 this is commonly referred to as the
 
01:52:24.510 --> 01:52:24.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:26.550 --> 01:52:26.560 align:start position:0%
every November the Department of
 
01:52:28.910 --> 01:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
Education reports out to the state board
 
01:52:32.310 --> 01:52:32.320 align:start position:0%
and then the legislative body um
 
01:52:35.069 --> 01:52:35.079 align:start position:0%
instances of bullying and restraint and
 
01:52:38.149 --> 01:52:38.159 align:start position:0%
seclusion and so there's a a board
 
01:52:40.430 --> 01:52:40.440 align:start position:0%
meeting every November where the
 
01:52:42.830 --> 01:52:42.840 align:start position:0%
department will present those numbers to
 
01:52:45.830 --> 01:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
the state board and then we compile the
 
01:52:47.830 --> 01:52:47.840 align:start position:0%
report and we present it to the general
 
01:52:50.750 --> 01:52:50.760 align:start position:0%
court um that information is all on our
 
01:52:53.189 --> 01:52:53.199 align:start position:0%
website but we look at those two areas
 
01:52:54.589 --> 01:52:54.599 align:start position:0%
restraint and
 
01:52:57.990 --> 01:52:58.000 align:start position:0%
seclusion and bullying and I know there
 
01:53:00.270 --> 01:53:00.280 align:start position:0%
were some discussion and some questions
 
01:53:02.550 --> 01:53:02.560 align:start position:0%
about what the department reports out
 
01:53:04.990 --> 01:53:05.000 align:start position:0%
and if we can kind of refine what the
 
01:53:07.189 --> 01:53:07.199 align:start position:0%
department is reporting on we did see I
 
01:53:09.550 --> 01:53:09.560 align:start position:0%
believe instances of bullying in Middle
 
01:53:12.669 --> 01:53:12.679 align:start position:0%
School go up I don't have the numbers in
 
01:53:15.750 --> 01:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
front of me but I have I I think there
 
01:53:19.270 --> 01:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
is a a proposed bill that will seek to
 
01:53:20.550 --> 01:53:20.560 align:start position:0%
amend uh
 
01:53:23.229 --> 01:53:23.239 align:start position:0%
193f so this chapter
 
01:53:25.750 --> 01:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
193f pupil safety and violence
 
01:53:28.069 --> 01:53:28.079 align:start position:0%
prevention probably worth flagging you
 
01:53:30.950 --> 01:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
will be just looking at
 
01:53:33.629 --> 01:53:33.639 align:start position:0%
that and again you know when you get
 
01:53:36.189 --> 01:53:36.199 align:start position:0%
that proposed bill it's great to put it
 
01:53:39.430 --> 01:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
into context with the entire chapter and
 
01:53:41.390 --> 01:53:41.400 align:start position:0%
look at what that proposed bill is
 
01:53:43.830 --> 01:53:43.840 align:start position:0%
seeking to do is it adding another
 
01:53:46.669 --> 01:53:46.679 align:start position:0%
provision is it amending something is it
 
01:53:50.149 --> 01:53:50.159 align:start position:0%
repealing a provision is it amending a
 
01:53:52.950 --> 01:53:52.960 align:start position:0%
definition and if it amends a definition
 
01:53:54.910 --> 01:53:54.920 align:start position:0%
how does that new
 
01:53:57.470 --> 01:53:57.480 align:start position:0%
definition in context how is that going
 
01:54:00.350 --> 01:54:00.360 align:start position:0%
to play out in the in the rest of the
 
01:54:03.390 --> 01:54:03.400 align:start position:0%
chapter are there other cross references
 
01:54:04.589 --> 01:54:04.599 align:start position:0%
to be aware
 
01:54:07.550 --> 01:54:07.560 align:start position:0%
of when you look at the
 
01:54:10.109 --> 01:54:10.119 align:start position:0%
definitions it's interesting that every
 
01:54:13.390 --> 01:54:13.400 align:start position:0%
section will have a different definition
 
01:54:15.589 --> 01:54:15.599 align:start position:0%
and when I first started with the
 
01:54:17.229 --> 01:54:17.239 align:start position:0%
Department of Education I found it
 
01:54:19.350 --> 01:54:19.360 align:start position:0%
interesting if not frustrating that
 
01:54:21.149 --> 01:54:21.159 align:start position:0%
there are different definitions of
 
01:54:21.159 --> 01:54:23.069 align:start position:0%
there are different definitions of
student

01:54:23.069 --> 01:54:23.079 align:start position:0%
student
 
01:54:24.910 --> 01:54:24.920 align:start position:0%
depending on what section of the law
 
01:54:27.430 --> 01:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
you're looking
 
01:54:30.830 --> 01:54:30.840 align:start position:0%
at there could be times where you want
 
01:54:32.990 --> 01:54:33.000 align:start position:0%
to be this legislative body wants to be
 
01:54:37.669 --> 01:54:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:39.870 --> 01:54:39.880 align:start position:0%
terminology there have been areas where
 
01:54:42.030 --> 01:54:42.040 align:start position:0%
we're very inconsistent with the
 
01:54:44.790 --> 01:54:44.800 align:start position:0%
terminology teacher versus educator
 
01:54:46.589 --> 01:54:46.599 align:start position:0%
that's a very common
 
01:54:50.229 --> 01:54:50.239 align:start position:0%
one so think about as as you consider
 
01:54:51.950 --> 01:54:51.960 align:start position:0%
these policy matters and consider these
 
01:54:54.510 --> 01:54:54.520 align:start position:0%
propos bills that consistent with
 
01:55:03.550 --> 01:55:03.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:05.390 --> 01:55:05.400 align:start position:0%
terminology I'm going to turn your
 
01:55:08.189 --> 01:55:08.199 align:start position:0%
attention to 194b and then with
 
01:55:09.669 --> 01:55:09.679 align:start position:0%
representative cordell's permission
 
01:55:11.030 --> 01:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
we'll just take a quick five minute
 
01:55:13.550 --> 01:55:13.560 align:start position:0%
break um but
 
01:55:18.830 --> 01:55:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:20.990 --> 01:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
Schools I know there was a lot of
 
01:55:23.270 --> 01:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
discussion on Monday about home
 
01:55:26.430 --> 01:55:26.440 align:start position:0%
education and chartered Public
 
01:55:28.990 --> 01:55:29.000 align:start position:0%
Schools you're going to find chapter
 
01:55:45.510 --> 01:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:48.109 --> 01:55:48.119 align:start position:0%
633 I want to highlight for your
 
01:55:50.270 --> 01:55:50.280 align:start position:0%
consideration and
 
01:55:54.470 --> 01:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:57.629 --> 01:55:57.639 align:start position:0%
b1a which is the statement of purpose
 
01:56:03.790 --> 01:56:03.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:06.189 --> 01:56:06.199 align:start position:0%
B3 and if I may I'll read to you
 
01:56:08.270 --> 01:56:08.280 align:start position:0%
directly from 194
 
01:56:11.830 --> 01:56:11.840 align:start position:0%
B3 and it says except as otherwise
 
01:56:15.149 --> 01:56:15.159 align:start position:0%
provided in law chartered Public Schools
 
01:56:17.870 --> 01:56:17.880 align:start position:0%
shall be fully exempt from state laws
 
01:56:17.880 --> 01:56:19.830 align:start position:0%
shall be fully exempt from state laws
and

01:56:19.830 --> 01:56:19.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:56:22.990 --> 01:56:23.000 align:start position:0%
rules which otherwise apply to public or
 
01:56:24.750 --> 01:56:24.760 align:start position:0%
non-public schools or local school
 
01:56:27.470 --> 01:56:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:30.069 --> 01:56:30.079 align:start position:0%
districts it has similar language in the
 
01:56:33.629 --> 01:56:33.639 align:start position:0%
purpose statement 194
 
01:56:36.149 --> 01:56:36.159 align:start position:0%
b1a Roman numeral
 
01:56:38.629 --> 01:56:38.639 align:start position:0%
5 exempt charter schools from State
 
01:56:40.669 --> 01:56:40.679 align:start position:0%
statutes and rules other than where
 
01:56:42.950 --> 01:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
specified so what does that
 
01:56:45.270 --> 01:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
mean it means that as you are
 
01:56:47.870 --> 01:56:47.880 align:start position:0%
considering other laws that
 
01:56:50.830 --> 01:56:50.840 align:start position:0%
amend other
 
01:56:53.910 --> 01:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
chapters if it is the intent of this
 
01:56:58.229 --> 01:56:58.239 align:start position:0%
legislative body to have that law be
 
01:57:01.189 --> 01:57:01.199 align:start position:0%
applicable to Charter Schools it has to
 
01:57:04.750 --> 01:57:04.760 align:start position:0%
state that it has to explicitly state it
 
01:57:08.990 --> 01:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't explicitly state it 194b
 
01:57:11.069 --> 01:57:11.079 align:start position:0%
says charg of schools are exempt because
 
01:57:13.709 --> 01:57:13.719 align:start position:0%
the assumption is the legislative body
 
01:57:16.709 --> 01:57:16.719 align:start position:0%
wrote it the way they wanted it to
 
01:57:19.709 --> 01:57:19.719 align:start position:0%
read and so when you look at things like
 
01:57:22.790 --> 01:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to flip back here 1893
 
01:57:27.069 --> 01:57:27.079 align:start position:0%
a it states charter schools and it
 
01:57:28.950 --> 01:57:28.960 align:start position:0%
states charter schools because the
 
01:57:31.189 --> 01:57:31.199 align:start position:0%
legislative body wanted the background
 
01:57:33.830 --> 01:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
checks to apply equally to Charter
 
01:57:36.629 --> 01:57:36.639 align:start position:0%
Schools that's why you have to list
 
01:57:39.350 --> 01:57:39.360 align:start position:0%
those things out and when I say you
 
01:57:41.270 --> 01:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
please I don't mean it in a dismissive
 
01:57:42.750 --> 01:57:42.760 align:start position:0%
derogatory sense I'm trying to say
 
01:57:45.629 --> 01:57:45.639 align:start position:0%
legislative body as much as I can but I
 
01:57:49.109 --> 01:57:49.119 align:start position:0%
want to highlight the importance of that
 
01:57:51.550 --> 01:57:51.560 align:start position:0%
so these are things to consider as you
 
01:57:53.390 --> 01:57:53.400 align:start position:0%
think about these bills debate these
 
01:57:56.270 --> 01:57:56.280 align:start position:0%
bills and ultimately write
 
01:57:59.470 --> 01:57:59.480 align:start position:0%
them who is it applicable to because
 
01:58:03.149 --> 01:58:03.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:05.589 --> 01:58:05.599 align:start position:0%
18913a and you look at how it's written
 
01:58:07.430 --> 01:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
and this is again the background check
 
01:58:07.440 --> 01:58:08.310 align:start position:0%
and this is again the background check
for

01:58:08.310 --> 01:58:08.320 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:58:10.790 --> 01:58:10.800 align:start position:0%
employment you read through paragraph
 
01:58:13.830 --> 01:58:13.840 align:start position:0%
one and it lists out all these different
 
01:58:16.149 --> 01:58:16.159 align:start position:0%
schools when I first read it I thought
 
01:58:17.870 --> 01:58:17.880 align:start position:0%
there's got to be a way to consolidate
 
01:58:20.589 --> 01:58:20.599 align:start position:0%
it it's not written very well to be
 
01:58:22.189 --> 01:58:22.199 align:start position:0%
honest with you and I can say that
 
01:58:24.350 --> 01:58:24.360 align:start position:0%
because I wrote a lot of it it's not
 
01:58:27.069 --> 01:58:27.079 align:start position:0%
written very well it's very
 
01:58:29.510 --> 01:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
verbose but there's a reason for that
 
01:58:31.750 --> 01:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
because the legislature wanted to say
 
01:58:34.069 --> 01:58:34.079 align:start position:0%
this is applicable to all these
 
01:58:34.079 --> 01:58:36.390 align:start position:0%
this is applicable to all these
different

01:58:36.390 --> 01:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:58:38.709 --> 01:58:38.719 align:start position:0%
entities and that's why I highlight that
 
01:58:40.790 --> 01:58:40.800 align:start position:0%
for you on
 
01:58:43.910 --> 01:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
194b I have not found another provision
 
01:58:43.920 --> 01:58:44.830 align:start position:0%
194b I have not found another provision
that

01:58:44.830 --> 01:58:44.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:58:55.390 --> 01:58:55.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:57.270 --> 01:58:57.280 align:start position:0%
so again this is very much a kind of
 
01:59:00.910 --> 01:59:00.920 align:start position:0%
10,000 foot overview other areas um that
 
01:59:02.669 --> 01:59:02.679 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli and I wanted you
 
01:59:05.109 --> 01:59:05.119 align:start position:0%
to just be aware
 
01:59:08.430 --> 01:59:08.440 align:start position:0%
of is
 
01:59:10.550 --> 01:59:10.560 align:start position:0%
18966 Miss Fenton if I could just
 
01:59:13.550 --> 01:59:13.560 align:start position:0%
mention I believe that there you
 
01:59:16.470 --> 01:59:16.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned um the charter school chapter
 
01:59:19.229 --> 01:59:19.239 align:start position:0%
194b and I think that there are people
 
01:59:21.510 --> 01:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
within the department who are looking to
 
01:59:24.470 --> 01:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
try and and
 
01:59:29.830 --> 01:59:29.840 align:start position:0%
reord uh 94b because it um can be quite
 
01:59:32.629 --> 01:59:32.639 align:start position:0%
confusing uh between the types of
 
01:59:34.669 --> 01:59:34.679 align:start position:0%
charter schools and how they're
 
01:59:38.430 --> 01:59:38.440 align:start position:0%
authorized and so forth um so there is
 
01:59:41.910 --> 01:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
that attempt uh to go on um and just
 
01:59:44.310 --> 01:59:44.320 align:start position:0%
just know that they you have to read
 
01:59:46.790 --> 01:59:46.800 align:start position:0%
194b carefully if you're looking to do
 
01:59:50.510 --> 01:59:50.520 align:start position:0%
any um uh research there or uh drafting
 
01:59:54.589 --> 01:59:54.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:57.910 --> 01:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
yes so very quickly
 
02:00:01.870 --> 02:00:01.880 align:start position:0%
18966 which is the data inventory uh and
 
02:00:03.669 --> 02:00:03.679 align:start position:0%
policies you're going to find that on
 
02:00:27.229 --> 02:00:27.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:30.109 --> 02:00:30.119 align:start position:0%
home education which I know is the
 
02:00:33.950 --> 02:00:33.960 align:start position:0%
discussed on Monday is chapter
 
02:00:36.189 --> 02:00:36.199 align:start position:0%
193a and you're going to find that on
 
02:00:52.550 --> 02:00:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:55.790 --> 02:00:55.800 align:start position:0%
and very very briefly I'll just draw
 
02:00:58.669 --> 02:00:58.679 align:start position:0%
your attention on page
 
02:01:03.510 --> 02:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
565 to RSA 193 A3 which is that rulle
 
02:01:03.520 --> 02:01:05.149 align:start position:0%
565 to RSA 193 A3 which is that rulle
making

02:01:05.149 --> 02:01:05.159 align:start position:0%
making
 
02:01:08.069 --> 02:01:08.079 align:start position:0%
provision here it's set out in its own
 
02:01:11.229 --> 02:01:11.239 align:start position:0%
subheading its own
 
02:01:13.950 --> 02:01:13.960 align:start position:0%
law the State Board of Education shall
 
02:01:16.430 --> 02:01:16.440 align:start position:0%
adopt rules pursuant to again those are
 
02:01:19.109 --> 02:01:19.119 align:start position:0%
that those magic words those legislative
 
02:01:21.310 --> 02:01:21.320 align:start position:0%
magic words that give the the state
 
02:01:23.589 --> 02:01:23.599 align:start position:0%
board and the Department rule making
 
02:01:26.950 --> 02:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
Authority and tells the department what
 
02:01:29.589 --> 02:01:29.599 align:start position:0%
the rule making should should
 
02:01:32.310 --> 02:01:32.320 align:start position:0%
cover it's interesting that in this
 
02:01:35.229 --> 02:01:35.239 align:start position:0%
particular chapter the rule making is
 
02:01:38.470 --> 02:01:38.480 align:start position:0%
its own statute there's so many
 
02:01:41.350 --> 02:01:41.360 align:start position:0%
different ways to do it you can include
 
02:01:43.910 --> 02:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
it in a provision you can make it its
 
02:01:46.109 --> 02:01:46.119 align:start position:0%
own provision but these are just some
 
02:01:48.669 --> 02:01:48.679 align:start position:0%
examples as you begin your process of
 
02:01:51.350 --> 02:01:51.360 align:start position:0%
legislating and policymaking of how to
 
02:01:54.310 --> 02:01:54.320 align:start position:0%
structure sh so I just highlight these
 
02:01:54.320 --> 02:02:01.470 align:start position:0%
structure sh so I just highlight these
for

02:02:01.470 --> 02:02:01.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:05.709 --> 02:02:05.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:15.550 --> 02:02:15.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:17.750 --> 02:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
schools and you're going to find that on
 
02:02:38.510 --> 02:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:55.669 --> 02:02:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:58.149 --> 02:02:58.159 align:start position:0%
one I I only chuckle because
 
02:02:59.830 --> 02:02:59.840 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli is grinning at
 
02:03:03.229 --> 02:03:03.239 align:start position:0%
me as we talk about RSA 195 Cooperative
 
02:03:05.629 --> 02:03:05.639 align:start position:0%
school districts there's a an enormous
 
02:03:10.149 --> 02:03:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:13.350 --> 02:03:13.360 align:start position:0%
cooperatives there have been study
 
02:03:16.310 --> 02:03:16.320 align:start position:0%
committees created legislatively that
 
02:03:20.350 --> 02:03:20.360 align:start position:0%
have looked at this issue uh typically
 
02:03:23.990 --> 02:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
when 195 D is or I'm sorry 195
 
02:03:26.069 --> 02:03:26.079 align:start position:0%
Cooperative schools are brought up it's
 
02:03:27.629 --> 02:03:27.639 align:start position:0%
really important to recognize the
 
02:03:30.109 --> 02:03:30.119 align:start position:0%
history of them it's worth bringing in
 
02:03:32.750 --> 02:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
the school boards Association or another
 
02:03:34.950 --> 02:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
attorney who really has worked very
 
02:03:37.189 --> 02:03:37.199 align:start position:0%
closely with cooperatives there's been a
 
02:03:39.830 --> 02:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
lot of frustration as to how the law is
 
02:03:43.709 --> 02:03:43.719 align:start position:0%
written and how schools can successfully
 
02:03:46.390 --> 02:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
withdraw from cooperatives but when we
 
02:03:48.069 --> 02:03:48.079 align:start position:0%
look at cooperatives there are times
 
02:03:50.510 --> 02:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
where just understanding kind of the how
 
02:03:53.390 --> 02:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
did we get here is pretty critical and I
 
02:03:55.510 --> 02:03:55.520 align:start position:0%
think this is one of those areas
 
02:03:56.990 --> 02:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
representative cordellia I hope I didn't
 
02:04:00.589 --> 02:04:00.599 align:start position:0%
speak out of turn um but it is just a
 
02:04:03.589 --> 02:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
really complex area I know historically
 
02:04:07.310 --> 02:04:07.320 align:start position:0%
one of the conversations has been about
 
02:04:09.870 --> 02:04:09.880 align:start position:0%
what role the State Board of Education
 
02:04:12.189 --> 02:04:12.199 align:start position:0%
plays with cooperatives when a
 
02:04:14.470 --> 02:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
Cooperative is formed and when they are
 
02:04:17.310 --> 02:04:17.320 align:start position:0%
dissolved it goes before the state board
 
02:04:19.790 --> 02:04:19.800 align:start position:0%
but I know from my my work at the
 
02:04:22.350 --> 02:04:22.360 align:start position:0%
department the question has always
 
02:04:25.390 --> 02:04:25.400 align:start position:0%
been and then what what does the State
 
02:04:27.229 --> 02:04:27.239 align:start position:0%
Board do what role does the State Board
 
02:04:29.430 --> 02:04:29.440 align:start position:0%
Play and so these are some policy
 
02:04:31.669 --> 02:04:31.679 align:start position:0%
considerations to think about when you
 
02:04:35.750 --> 02:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
look at 190 uh chapter 195 and I would
 
02:04:38.990 --> 02:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
be so bold as to say it is worth getting
 
02:04:40.189 --> 02:04:40.199 align:start position:0%
the history
 
02:04:43.589 --> 02:04:43.599 align:start position:0%
lesson on cooperatives certainly can't
 
02:04:45.229 --> 02:04:45.239 align:start position:0%
come from me but there are other
 
02:04:47.350 --> 02:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
attorneys who um who have come before
 
02:04:49.589 --> 02:04:49.599 align:start position:0%
this board and would be willing to do so
 
02:04:52.149 --> 02:04:52.159 align:start position:0%
again who would explain that and it's
 
02:04:54.189 --> 02:04:54.199 align:start position:0%
it's worth taking the time to really
 
02:04:56.950 --> 02:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
understand the nature of
 
02:04:59.910 --> 02:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
cooperatives two other areas that they
 
02:05:01.589 --> 02:05:01.599 align:start position:0%
won't necessarily come before this
 
02:05:04.310 --> 02:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
committee but it's worth being aware of
 
02:05:04.320 --> 02:05:06.030 align:start position:0%
committee but it's worth being aware of
rsa1

02:05:06.030 --> 02:05:06.040 align:start position:0%
rsa1
 
02:05:09.750 --> 02:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
91a is New Hampshire's right to no law
 
02:05:11.990 --> 02:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
right we're familiar with Foya which is
 
02:05:14.229 --> 02:05:14.239 align:start position:0%
the federal version in New Hampshire
 
02:05:23.430 --> 02:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:31.149 --> 02:05:31.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:33.629 --> 02:05:33.639 align:start position:0%
where I was just laughing at myself
 
02:05:35.589 --> 02:05:35.599 align:start position:0%
because I was flipping the pages as I
 
02:05:37.669 --> 02:05:37.679 align:start position:0%
said you'll find 901a in this book and I
 
02:05:39.750 --> 02:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
wasn't finding 91a in this book I was
 
02:05:42.109 --> 02:05:42.119 align:start position:0%
like I hope you find 91a in this book
 
02:05:46.430 --> 02:05:46.440 align:start position:0%
and you do luckily uh you find it near
 
02:05:48.709 --> 02:05:48.719 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the book and I'll get
 
02:05:50.510 --> 02:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
you the page number we all seem to like
 
02:05:50.520 --> 02:05:54.870 align:start position:0%
you the page number we all seem to like
that

02:05:54.870 --> 02:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:00.350 --> 02:06:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:06.430 --> 02:06:06.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:12.910 --> 02:06:12.920 align:start position:0%
begins on page 20 oh page 16 um it's its
 
02:06:14.510 --> 02:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
own chapter and I bring it to your
 
02:06:17.470 --> 02:06:17.480 align:start position:0%
attention one because we often reference
 
02:06:20.229 --> 02:06:20.239 align:start position:0%
right to know it's worth looking at that
 
02:06:23.270 --> 02:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
chapter and what it covers
 
02:06:26.750 --> 02:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
and be mindful that there have been um
 
02:06:28.870 --> 02:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
policy debates as to whether or not this
 
02:06:31.109 --> 02:06:31.119 align:start position:0%
should be applicable of right to know
 
02:06:34.750 --> 02:06:34.760 align:start position:0%
91a it has its own chapter so just be
 
02:06:37.589 --> 02:06:37.599 align:start position:0%
mindful of that cross reference it
 
02:06:39.350 --> 02:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
always makes me nervous when the right
 
02:06:42.069 --> 02:06:42.079 align:start position:0%
to no law is it referenced somewhere
 
02:06:44.629 --> 02:06:44.639 align:start position:0%
else it does have its own
 
02:06:47.350 --> 02:06:47.360 align:start position:0%
chapter so just be mindful of that it
 
02:06:50.189 --> 02:06:50.199 align:start position:0%
would might already be exempt under the
 
02:06:53.390 --> 02:06:53.400 align:start position:0%
committee but restraint and seclusion
 
02:06:55.270 --> 02:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
obviously affects Public Schools I think
 
02:07:00.750 --> 02:07:00.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:05.030 --> 02:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
U that is also an area that will often
 
02:07:07.270 --> 02:07:07.280 align:start position:0%
get amended and I want to highlight
 
02:07:16.629 --> 02:07:16.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:20.589 --> 02:07:20.599 align:start position:0%
U 126 U is found on page 88 that's the
 
02:07:23.870 --> 02:07:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:30.430 --> 02:07:30.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:32.990 --> 02:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
89 there are two definitions that I want
 
02:07:34.430 --> 02:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
to bring to your attention I want to
 
02:07:35.709 --> 02:07:35.719 align:start position:0%
bring it to your attention for a couple
 
02:07:38.030 --> 02:07:38.040 align:start position:0%
of reasons I understand as a policy
 
02:07:41.229 --> 02:07:41.239 align:start position:0%
matter this subject is dealt is handled
 
02:07:44.709 --> 02:07:44.719 align:start position:0%
by a different committee but this topic
 
02:07:47.990 --> 02:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
affects education and schools it's worth
 
02:07:50.870 --> 02:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
noting and I also want to identify for
 
02:07:50.880 --> 02:07:51.990 align:start position:0%
noting and I also want to identify for
you

02:07:51.990 --> 02:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:07:53.830 --> 02:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
that when we look at the definition of
 
02:07:57.229 --> 02:07:57.239 align:start position:0%
the term restraint and you'll find that
 
02:08:00.830 --> 02:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
on page 89 in that left hand column down
 
02:08:10.790 --> 02:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:13.470 --> 02:08:13.480 align:start position:0%
bottom the definition goes
 
02:08:15.390 --> 02:08:15.400 align:start position:0%
on quite a
 
02:08:19.669 --> 02:08:19.679 align:start position:0%
bit and it's broken into these subp
 
02:08:22.589 --> 02:08:22.599 align:start position:0%
parts but what I find fascinating about
 
02:08:25.350 --> 02:08:25.360 align:start position:0%
the restraint and seclusion
 
02:08:28.350 --> 02:08:28.360 align:start position:0%
law is it's the only area that I've
 
02:08:31.189 --> 02:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
identified that the definition also
 
02:08:36.390 --> 02:08:36.400 align:start position:0%
talks about what is not
 
02:08:38.709 --> 02:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
restraint that's an interesting way to
 
02:08:39.669 --> 02:08:39.679 align:start position:0%
create a
 
02:08:42.310 --> 02:08:42.320 align:start position:0%
definition so you have a definition of
 
02:08:44.470 --> 02:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
what that term means but when you look
 
02:08:46.510 --> 02:08:46.520 align:start position:0%
at the top of the column on the right
 
02:08:49.350 --> 02:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
hand side in subsection e it says
 
02:08:52.109 --> 02:08:52.119 align:start position:0%
restraint shall not include
 
02:08:52.119 --> 02:08:54.069 align:start position:0%
restraint shall not include
the

02:08:54.069 --> 02:08:54.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:08:56.549 --> 02:08:56.559 align:start position:0%
following they do the same thing for the
 
02:08:56.559 --> 02:08:58.990 align:start position:0%
following they do the same thing for the
term

02:08:58.990 --> 02:08:59.000 align:start position:0%
term
 
02:09:01.669 --> 02:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
seclusion and as I work in Restraint and
 
02:09:04.189 --> 02:09:04.199 align:start position:0%
seclusion I've never seen a def a
 
02:09:06.870 --> 02:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
definition written that way I just found
 
02:09:09.030 --> 02:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
it fascinating again another reason
 
02:09:12.310 --> 02:09:12.320 align:start position:0%
nobody hangs out with me I get it but I
 
02:09:14.510 --> 02:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
found that fascinating so as you do your
 
02:09:17.149 --> 02:09:17.159 align:start position:0%
work as policy makers think about how
 
02:09:19.030 --> 02:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
you can craft these
 
02:09:21.109 --> 02:09:21.119 align:start position:0%
definitions there might be times where
 
02:09:24.149 --> 02:09:24.159 align:start position:0%
you need to talk about what is not
 
02:09:26.950 --> 02:09:26.960 align:start position:0%
covered by the term the only area I
 
02:09:30.470 --> 02:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
found it is here in 126 U restraint and
 
02:09:32.870 --> 02:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
seclusion defining what it is and what
 
02:09:32.880 --> 02:09:33.669 align:start position:0%
seclusion defining what it is and what
it

02:09:33.669 --> 02:09:33.679 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:09:35.669 --> 02:09:35.679 align:start position:0%
isn't and I think it's a really
 
02:09:37.910 --> 02:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
interesting way to approach a very
 
02:09:41.390 --> 02:09:41.400 align:start position:0%
complicated topic but it gives a lot
 
02:09:46.030 --> 02:09:46.040 align:start position:0%
of a lot of direction to the field so
 
02:09:47.830 --> 02:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
again I highlight it not that you're
 
02:09:50.549 --> 02:09:50.559 align:start position:0%
going to work on 126 U but given the
 
02:09:53.109 --> 02:09:53.119 align:start position:0%
work that you do in education it's
 
02:09:55.030 --> 02:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
certainly worth knowing that restraint
 
02:09:58.350 --> 02:09:58.360 align:start position:0%
and seclusion is housed in 126
 
02:10:00.549 --> 02:10:00.559 align:start position:0%
you representative cordelli with your
 
02:10:02.549 --> 02:10:02.559 align:start position:0%
permission if we could take a five
 
02:10:03.870 --> 02:10:03.880 align:start position:0%
minute break are you okay with that
 
02:10:09.109 --> 02:10:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:20.310 --> 02:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:20.320 --> 02:10:50.229 align:start position:0%
 
after

02:10:50.229 --> 02:10:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:50.239 --> 02:11:20.229 align:start position:0%

02:18:35.950 --> 02:18:35.960 align:start position:0%
if uh everyone could take their seats I
 
02:19:13.230 --> 02:19:13.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:15.070 --> 02:19:15.080 align:start position:0%
I fell for
 
02:19:17.629 --> 02:19:17.639 align:start position:0%
it all right well then I set the bar
 
02:19:19.990 --> 02:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
really low because I forgot to turn on
 
02:19:22.270 --> 02:19:22.280 align:start position:0%
my microphone so now when everyone else
 
02:19:24.629 --> 02:19:24.639 align:start position:0%
does it you can just blame it on
 
02:19:27.990 --> 02:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
me so um all right I'll draw your
 
02:19:29.469 --> 02:19:29.479 align:start position:0%
attention back I appreciate your
 
02:19:33.070 --> 02:19:33.080 align:start position:0%
patience um as we go through this
 
02:19:36.110 --> 02:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
so you each have a booklet of the code
 
02:19:36.120 --> 02:19:36.910 align:start position:0%
so you each have a booklet of the code
of

02:19:36.910 --> 02:19:36.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:19:39.110 --> 02:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
conduct I want to highlight it for your
 
02:19:40.830 --> 02:19:40.840 align:start position:0%
attention because it probably will be
 
02:19:42.270 --> 02:19:42.280 align:start position:0%
something that you're discussing or at
 
02:19:45.230 --> 02:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
least referencing as you go through your
 
02:19:45.240 --> 02:19:47.469 align:start position:0%
least referencing as you go through your
policymaking

02:19:47.469 --> 02:19:47.479 align:start position:0%
policymaking
 
02:19:52.389 --> 02:19:52.399 align:start position:0%
role if you look at 12 page 12 of your
 
02:19:52.399 --> 02:19:57.150 align:start position:0%
role if you look at 12 page 12 of your
statute

02:19:57.150 --> 02:19:57.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:59.389 --> 02:19:59.399 align:start position:0%
book H those of you who closed your
 
02:20:01.429 --> 02:20:01.439 align:start position:0%
books no
 
02:20:04.230 --> 02:20:04.240 align:start position:0%
no you you you failed the test we got to
 
02:20:07.590 --> 02:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:10.190 --> 02:20:10.200 align:start position:0%
open if it makes you feel better I
 
02:20:11.870 --> 02:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
actually drive around with a copy of the
 
02:20:14.790 --> 02:20:14.800 align:start position:0%
books in my car which again is why why
 
02:20:16.630 --> 02:20:16.640 align:start position:0%
nobody in Amherst or Milford hangs out
 
02:20:19.990 --> 02:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
with me right there you go um so I have
 
02:20:22.309 --> 02:20:22.319 align:start position:0%
a copy on desk and a copy in my car at
 
02:20:26.790 --> 02:20:26.800 align:start position:0%
all times good times huh but that's how
 
02:20:29.510 --> 02:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
important they are and this is really
 
02:20:32.309 --> 02:20:32.319 align:start position:0%
the key to your policymaking success so
 
02:20:34.190 --> 02:20:34.200 align:start position:0%
if you look at page
 
02:20:37.150 --> 02:20:37.160 align:start position:0%
12 on the right hand
 
02:20:40.870 --> 02:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
column there was a bill passed back in
 
02:20:40.880 --> 02:20:43.670 align:start position:0%
column there was a bill passed back in
2018

02:20:43.670 --> 02:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
2018
 
02:20:46.309 --> 02:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
2019 and it provided
 
02:20:48.750 --> 02:20:48.760 align:start position:0%
for and you're going to see it in
 
02:20:51.630 --> 02:20:51.640 align:start position:0%
subsection double C1 The
 
02:20:54.150 --> 02:20:54.160 align:start position:0%
Establishment and enforcement of a code
 
02:20:56.670 --> 02:20:56.680 align:start position:0%
of ethics and code of conduct for
 
02:21:00.790 --> 02:21:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:03.550 --> 02:21:03.560 align:start position:0%
personnel and then it sets forth these
 
02:21:08.790 --> 02:21:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:11.309 --> 02:21:11.319 align:start position:0%
principles that is the code of conduct
 
02:21:14.110 --> 02:21:14.120 align:start position:0%
that is the establishment legislatively
 
02:21:15.630 --> 02:21:15.640 align:start position:0%
of the code of conduct it was a
 
02:21:18.309 --> 02:21:18.319 align:start position:0%
directive to the Department of Education
 
02:21:22.110 --> 02:21:22.120 align:start position:0%
you are to write the code of conduct I
 
02:21:23.510 --> 02:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
highlight the code of conduct because I
 
02:21:26.590 --> 02:21:26.600 align:start position:0%
think it's a great example of the
 
02:21:29.590 --> 02:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
legislature setting out the groundwork
 
02:21:31.389 --> 02:21:31.399 align:start position:0%
here's what we want it to cover we want
 
02:21:33.710 --> 02:21:33.720 align:start position:0%
it to have these four
 
02:21:36.190 --> 02:21:36.200 align:start position:0%
principles and and the department and
 
02:21:38.190 --> 02:21:38.200 align:start position:0%
the State Board is going to enter into
 
02:21:41.270 --> 02:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
rul making to flush out what those
 
02:21:43.990 --> 02:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
principles look like I go back to my
 
02:21:48.110 --> 02:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
example of the framework of the house
 
02:21:50.270 --> 02:21:50.280 align:start position:0%
and then the wallpaper and the paint and
 
02:21:50.280 --> 02:21:51.270 align:start position:0%
and then the wallpaper and the paint and
the

02:21:51.270 --> 02:21:51.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:21:53.270 --> 02:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
appliances this is a really great
 
02:21:55.750 --> 02:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
example of it this is the law this was a
 
02:21:58.030 --> 02:21:58.040 align:start position:0%
bill that was brought forward to this
 
02:22:01.469 --> 02:22:01.479 align:start position:0%
committee and debated and
 
02:22:04.270 --> 02:22:04.280 align:start position:0%
passed and then this was created these
 
02:22:06.190 --> 02:22:06.200 align:start position:0%
are the rules this is the code of
 
02:22:09.510 --> 02:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
conduct it's not often that the
 
02:22:11.750 --> 02:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
department takes its rules and puts it
 
02:22:13.389 --> 02:22:13.399 align:start position:0%
into a little book like this the rules
 
02:22:14.990 --> 02:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
can be found on our website we'll look
 
02:22:17.349 --> 02:22:17.359 align:start position:0%
at that in a minute but because this
 
02:22:21.030 --> 02:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
governs an Educator's credential or
 
02:22:23.550 --> 02:22:23.560 align:start position:0%
their license um this is why the
 
02:22:26.429 --> 02:22:26.439 align:start position:0%
department created this
 
02:22:30.790 --> 02:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
booklet it was passed in 2019 it has not
 
02:22:33.349 --> 02:22:33.359 align:start position:0%
been amended since that time so I know
 
02:22:36.790 --> 02:22:36.800 align:start position:0%
it looks old but it's still valid um
 
02:22:39.030 --> 02:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
because it hasn't been amended so when
 
02:22:41.550 --> 02:22:41.560 align:start position:0%
you look at this the first
 
02:22:44.990 --> 02:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
section is the code of
 
02:22:48.030 --> 02:22:48.040 align:start position:0%
ethics the code of ethics is is not
 
02:22:51.750 --> 02:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
enforcable it is inspiration AAL
 
02:22:54.190 --> 02:22:54.200 align:start position:0%
aspirational um it provides guidance to
 
02:22:55.510 --> 02:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
Educators but
 
02:22:59.230 --> 02:22:59.240 align:start position:0%
it's it's not enforceable but on page
 
02:23:03.389 --> 02:23:03.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:08.270 --> 02:23:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:11.110 --> 02:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
section and then if you look at page 11
 
02:23:13.630 --> 02:23:13.640 align:start position:0%
it goes into the various principles and
 
02:23:13.640 --> 02:23:15.349 align:start position:0%
it goes into the various principles and
those

02:23:15.349 --> 02:23:15.359 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:23:18.150 --> 02:23:18.160 align:start position:0%
principles were not created by the state
 
02:23:20.550 --> 02:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
board and they weren't created by the
 
02:23:21.590 --> 02:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
02:23:25.670 --> 02:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
Education they are based on the law as
 
02:23:28.750 --> 02:23:28.760 align:start position:0%
written so you look at page 12
 
02:23:30.469 --> 02:23:30.479 align:start position:0%
responsibility to the education
 
02:23:32.790 --> 02:23:32.800 align:start position:0%
profession and educational professionals
 
02:23:34.990 --> 02:23:35.000 align:start position:0%
and it's mirrored right
 
02:23:38.590 --> 02:23:38.600 align:start position:0%
here but what the rules do is flush out
 
02:23:41.230 --> 02:23:41.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:43.830 --> 02:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
means so I think it's just such a great
 
02:23:45.790 --> 02:23:45.800 align:start position:0%
example that the legislature gave a
 
02:23:48.110 --> 02:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
directive here's what we want it to
 
02:23:52.150 --> 02:23:52.160 align:start position:0%
cover and the rulle making then really
 
02:23:56.110 --> 02:23:56.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:00.110 --> 02:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
means so the code of conduct is it's not
 
02:24:02.950 --> 02:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
an employment issue it is a licensing
 
02:24:04.429 --> 02:24:04.439 align:start position:0%
issue it is the difference between
 
02:24:06.389 --> 02:24:06.399 align:start position:0%
employment and
 
02:24:10.389 --> 02:24:10.399 align:start position:0%
lure and the department has this booklet
 
02:24:13.269 --> 02:24:13.279 align:start position:0%
and administers uh sanctions on an
 
02:24:15.630 --> 02:24:15.640 align:start position:0%
Educator's license if appropriate if
 
02:24:17.349 --> 02:24:17.359 align:start position:0%
there is a found violation of the code
 
02:24:17.359 --> 02:24:19.349 align:start position:0%
there is a found violation of the code
of

02:24:19.349 --> 02:24:19.359 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:24:21.750 --> 02:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
conduct and there are times where the
 
02:24:23.750 --> 02:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
code of conduct is brought up proposed
 
02:24:27.230 --> 02:24:27.240 align:start position:0%
to be amended added to what have you and
 
02:24:31.550 --> 02:24:31.560 align:start position:0%
again I reference 21 and9 which sets out
 
02:24:34.830 --> 02:24:34.840 align:start position:0%
that legislative authority to create a
 
02:24:37.670 --> 02:24:37.680 align:start position:0%
code of conduct and then the ru making
 
02:24:41.510 --> 02:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
piece of it so as you do your policym
 
02:24:43.429 --> 02:24:43.439 align:start position:0%
think about if it's an amendment to the
 
02:24:45.750 --> 02:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
code of conduct in terms of adding
 
02:24:48.510 --> 02:24:48.520 align:start position:0%
another uh responsibility or another
 
02:24:51.590 --> 02:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
principle or if it's a rule
 
02:24:54.590 --> 02:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
piece that wants to be amended any
 
02:24:56.510 --> 02:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
questions on that because the difference
 
02:24:59.870 --> 02:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
between employment and licensure can be
 
02:24:59.880 --> 02:25:10.429 align:start position:0%
between employment and licensure can be
sometimes

02:25:10.429 --> 02:25:10.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:12.590 --> 02:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
complicated a few other things to be
 
02:25:16.030 --> 02:25:16.040 align:start position:0%
mindful of as you look through this this
 
02:25:16.040 --> 02:25:17.830 align:start position:0%
mindful of as you look through this this
law

02:25:17.830 --> 02:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
law
 
02:25:20.630 --> 02:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
book and we'll stick with page 12 12
 
02:25:22.550 --> 02:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
since we're already
 
02:25:25.870 --> 02:25:25.880 align:start position:0%
there at the bottom of page 12 has a
 
02:25:29.389 --> 02:25:29.399 align:start position:0%
little highlighted section in bold
 
02:25:33.349 --> 02:25:33.359 align:start position:0%
amendments that gives you a very brief
 
02:25:36.469 --> 02:25:36.479 align:start position:0%
history of the legislative changes which
 
02:25:45.910 --> 02:25:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:48.550 --> 02:25:48.560 align:start position:0%
law there have been times where I have
 
02:25:50.870 --> 02:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
gone through that and looked at how it's
 
02:25:54.230 --> 02:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
been changed over the
 
02:25:57.870 --> 02:25:57.880 align:start position:0%
years it's a helpful quick reference
 
02:26:00.030 --> 02:26:00.040 align:start position:0%
there are times where the amendments are
 
02:26:03.630 --> 02:26:03.640 align:start position:0%
so vast where there it's a complete
 
02:26:06.349 --> 02:26:06.359 align:start position:0%
rework that it's not going to be able to
 
02:26:08.550 --> 02:26:08.560 align:start position:0%
be caught in in the word of the day
 
02:26:11.030 --> 02:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
blurb um it's just not going to be
 
02:26:13.070 --> 02:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
effective and you might have to do some
 
02:26:15.349 --> 02:26:15.359 align:start position:0%
more legislative history to really find
 
02:26:17.429 --> 02:26:17.439 align:start position:0%
out what that prior amendment was but
 
02:26:22.150 --> 02:26:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:23.710 --> 02:26:23.720 align:start position:0%
the other area that I will bring your
 
02:26:23.720 --> 02:26:25.230 align:start position:0%
the other area that I will bring your
attention

02:26:25.230 --> 02:26:25.240 align:start position:0%
attention
 
02:26:30.190 --> 02:26:30.200 align:start position:0%
to is references to case
 
02:26:32.830 --> 02:26:32.840 align:start position:0%
law you're not going to find references
 
02:26:34.990 --> 02:26:35.000 align:start position:0%
to case law in every section in the
 
02:26:37.670 --> 02:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
education book it's very different than
 
02:26:40.230 --> 02:26:40.240 align:start position:0%
in the criminal code in the criminal
 
02:26:43.309 --> 02:26:43.319 align:start position:0%
code you will find countless references
 
02:26:46.590 --> 02:26:46.600 align:start position:0%
to case law not every education statute
 
02:26:48.830 --> 02:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
is going to be litigated to the point
 
02:26:51.309 --> 02:26:51.319 align:start position:0%
where it becomes case
 
02:26:54.429 --> 02:26:54.439 align:start position:0%
law but there are sections where there
 
02:26:55.830 --> 02:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
will be case law
 
02:26:59.510 --> 02:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
references um and you can find one on
 
02:27:10.550 --> 02:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:13.590 --> 02:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
decision and under that very brief
 
02:27:16.590 --> 02:27:16.600 align:start position:0%
heading it gives you a very quick
 
02:27:19.150 --> 02:27:19.160 align:start position:0%
summary of what the case is and at the
 
02:27:24.230 --> 02:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
very end of that it gives you the case
 
02:27:28.990 --> 02:27:29.000 align:start position:0%
name and the citation so it says 20110
 
02:27:32.030 --> 02:27:32.040 align:start position:0%
190 NH
 
02:27:35.230 --> 02:27:35.240 align:start position:0%
727 that's the case
 
02:27:37.830 --> 02:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
name you can find that case I can help
 
02:27:39.830 --> 02:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
you find that case we can access that
 
02:27:42.750 --> 02:27:42.760 align:start position:0%
case again not every chapter or
 
02:27:44.630 --> 02:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
provision in the education book is going
 
02:27:44.640 --> 02:27:45.710 align:start position:0%
provision in the education book is going
to

02:27:45.710 --> 02:27:45.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:27:49.710 --> 02:27:49.720 align:start position:0%
have a case reference but if it does it
 
02:27:52.469 --> 02:27:52.479 align:start position:0%
might give you some
 
02:27:54.910 --> 02:27:54.920 align:start position:0%
guidance so it's worth at least looking
 
02:27:59.550 --> 02:27:59.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:02.710 --> 02:28:02.720 align:start position:0%
there I want to spend a brief bit of
 
02:28:06.349 --> 02:28:06.359 align:start position:0%
time if you flip to the back of your law
 
02:28:06.359 --> 02:28:21.190 align:start position:0%
time if you flip to the back of your law
book

02:28:21.190 --> 02:28:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:23.590 --> 02:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
it's worth becoming familiar with the
 
02:28:25.950 --> 02:28:25.960 align:start position:0%
index this is the paper version of
 
02:28:25.960 --> 02:28:26.870 align:start position:0%
index this is the paper version of
control

02:28:26.870 --> 02:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
control
 
02:28:30.070 --> 02:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
F right it's not as much fun I like
 
02:28:33.150 --> 02:28:33.160 align:start position:0%
contrl f as much as everybody else but
 
02:28:34.910 --> 02:28:34.920 align:start position:0%
the index can be very
 
02:28:37.110 --> 02:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
helpful it's
 
02:28:39.349 --> 02:28:39.359 align:start position:0%
designed I think it's a little
 
02:28:41.349 --> 02:28:41.359 align:start position:0%
counterintuitive I've struggled with it
 
02:28:45.870 --> 02:28:45.880 align:start position:0%
from time to time in large part you know
 
02:28:46.910 --> 02:28:46.920 align:start position:0%
you're going to have it's an
 
02:28:49.070 --> 02:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
alphabetized index which we're all used
 
02:28:52.590 --> 02:28:52.600 align:start position:0%
to but a lot of
 
02:28:59.469 --> 02:28:59.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:04.429 --> 02:29:04.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:08.790 --> 02:29:08.800 align:start position:0%
funds schools and school
 
02:29:10.990 --> 02:29:11.000 align:start position:0%
districts and you're going to find that
 
02:29:22.750 --> 02:29:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:25.630 --> 02:29:25.640 align:start position:0%
it starts on the very bottom of i43 but
 
02:29:28.230 --> 02:29:28.240 align:start position:0%
you're going to see how expansive that
 
02:29:31.469 --> 02:29:31.479 align:start position:0%
heading in the index is so when you look
 
02:29:33.710 --> 02:29:33.720 align:start position:0%
for a particular topic and you're not
 
02:29:38.150 --> 02:29:38.160 align:start position:0%
finding it in the alphabetized version
 
02:29:40.670 --> 02:29:40.680 align:start position:0%
you're not finding it at as its own
 
02:29:45.110 --> 02:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
heading look under school and school
 
02:29:47.870 --> 02:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
districts I'm not sure why it's grouped
 
02:29:50.389 --> 02:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
that way but there have been many times
 
02:29:52.790 --> 02:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
where I've been successful in finding it
 
02:29:56.950 --> 02:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
in that general area so again this is
 
02:29:59.510 --> 02:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
the paper version of control F it's not
 
02:30:01.910 --> 02:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
always pretty it's not always fun but
 
02:30:12.710 --> 02:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:15.510 --> 02:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
resource couple of just other things to
 
02:30:17.510 --> 02:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
be mindful of and we've talked about a
 
02:30:19.030 --> 02:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
lot of them as we've gone through
 
02:30:21.110 --> 02:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
because I've tried to use sections of
 
02:30:23.110 --> 02:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
the law to really highlight these
 
02:30:25.309 --> 02:30:25.319 align:start position:0%
Provisions I didn't want to just drag
 
02:30:26.990 --> 02:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
you through the law book without a
 
02:30:28.830 --> 02:30:28.840 align:start position:0%
purpose and a
 
02:30:31.510 --> 02:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
Direction but be mindful of that Ru
 
02:30:33.309 --> 02:30:33.319 align:start position:0%
making provision I've highlighted a
 
02:30:35.910 --> 02:30:35.920 align:start position:0%
couple of examples for
 
02:30:39.269 --> 02:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
you as you as this uh legislative body
 
02:30:41.710 --> 02:30:41.720 align:start position:0%
goes through its policy
 
02:30:44.830 --> 02:30:44.840 align:start position:0%
directive be mindful of whether rule
 
02:30:47.630 --> 02:30:47.640 align:start position:0%
making is necessary and if it's
 
02:30:51.510 --> 02:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
necessary to use those magic words rules
 
02:30:55.070 --> 02:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:58.630 --> 02:30:58.640 align:start position:0%
541a and then give the Board of
 
02:31:00.230 --> 02:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
Education and the department the
 
02:31:05.870 --> 02:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:09.510 --> 02:31:09.520 align:start position:0%
cover and don't be shy about looking at
 
02:31:12.389 --> 02:31:12.399 align:start position:0%
other areas that we've highlighted and
 
02:31:14.550 --> 02:31:14.560 align:start position:0%
mimicking how other areas have been
 
02:31:17.950 --> 02:31:17.960 align:start position:0%
drafted I think CTE is a great example
 
02:31:21.309 --> 02:31:21.319 align:start position:0%
CTE really told this state board what
 
02:31:24.190 --> 02:31:24.200 align:start position:0%
the rules should cover code of conduct
 
02:31:26.469 --> 02:31:26.479 align:start position:0%
set out those four principles and those
 
02:31:29.429 --> 02:31:29.439 align:start position:0%
four principles were used
 
02:31:31.830 --> 02:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
verbatim but the department and the
 
02:31:34.309 --> 02:31:34.319 align:start position:0%
State Board had discretion as to what
 
02:31:36.910 --> 02:31:36.920 align:start position:0%
those principles then covered so as a
 
02:31:38.950 --> 02:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
legislative body those are things to be
 
02:31:42.349 --> 02:31:42.359 align:start position:0%
mindful of and do not be shy of looking
 
02:31:44.070 --> 02:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
at the areas we've highlighted and
 
02:31:46.150 --> 02:31:46.160 align:start position:0%
saying hey it was done really well in
 
02:31:48.630 --> 02:31:48.640 align:start position:0%
this area let's mimic it
 
02:31:53.070 --> 02:31:53.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:57.910 --> 02:31:57.920 align:start position:0%
you the other area that this legislative
 
02:32:00.590 --> 02:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
body should be mindful of is it's always
 
02:32:03.429 --> 02:32:03.439 align:start position:0%
at the very bottom of the proposed bill
 
02:32:06.349 --> 02:32:06.359 align:start position:0%
I sometimes forget about it as well it's
 
02:32:07.990 --> 02:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
the effective
 
02:32:11.110 --> 02:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
date I will tell you anecdotally here is
 
02:32:13.550 --> 02:32:13.560 align:start position:0%
what happens with effective dates no one
 
02:32:15.750 --> 02:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
pays attention to them until
 
02:32:18.550 --> 02:32:18.560 align:start position:0%
May because in May we're starting to
 
02:32:20.950 --> 02:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
wrap up we're starting the we crossover
 
02:32:23.110 --> 02:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
has occurred we know what bills are
 
02:32:25.389 --> 02:32:25.399 align:start position:0%
going to eventually end up on the
 
02:32:27.830 --> 02:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
governor's desk and that is when as a
 
02:32:30.429 --> 02:32:30.439 align:start position:0%
department myself included guilty is
 
02:32:32.750 --> 02:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
charged we start looking at oh when is
 
02:32:32.760 --> 02:32:33.630 align:start position:0%
charged we start looking at oh when is
this

02:32:33.630 --> 02:32:33.640 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:32:36.510 --> 02:32:36.520 align:start position:0%
effective and we need to be mindful of
 
02:32:39.790 --> 02:32:39.800 align:start position:0%
the task we are are putting on whatever
 
02:32:42.070 --> 02:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
the school district or the department or
 
02:32:44.550 --> 02:32:44.560 align:start position:0%
whatever the entity is when that
 
02:32:46.950 --> 02:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
effective date is is there enough time
 
02:32:48.990 --> 02:32:49.000 align:start position:0%
is there enough runway for the entity
 
02:32:52.070 --> 02:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
that is affected to make that change and
 
02:32:55.030 --> 02:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
be and be successful at it there have
 
02:32:57.990 --> 02:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
been times in my testimony where I have
 
02:32:59.790 --> 02:32:59.800 align:start position:0%
requested this legislative body to be
 
02:33:01.630 --> 02:33:01.640 align:start position:0%
mindful of giving the department enough
 
02:33:04.030 --> 02:33:04.040 align:start position:0%
time to be successful in
 
02:33:06.830 --> 02:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
implementation and so this is probably
 
02:33:10.670 --> 02:33:10.680 align:start position:0%
my own may aopa but I'm here to say uh
 
02:33:13.030 --> 02:33:13.040 align:start position:0%
together working hand inand we can be
 
02:33:15.429 --> 02:33:15.439 align:start position:0%
mindful of effective dates because I
 
02:33:17.230 --> 02:33:17.240 align:start position:0%
have often times forgotten about them
 
02:33:19.550 --> 02:33:19.560 align:start position:0%
until it's almost too late but it is
 
02:33:22.230 --> 02:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
something to be to be mindful of whether
 
02:33:24.750 --> 02:33:24.760 align:start position:0%
it's going to be effective July 1st of
 
02:33:28.710 --> 02:33:28.720 align:start position:0%
this year January or you know two three
 
02:33:31.389 --> 02:33:31.399 align:start position:0%
years out we've had one bill that um I
 
02:33:35.429 --> 02:33:35.439 align:start position:0%
had I think it was um two-year effective
 
02:33:37.630 --> 02:33:37.640 align:start position:0%
date and so the department wrote a
 
02:33:39.670 --> 02:33:39.680 align:start position:0%
technical advisory on it and had it
 
02:33:41.389 --> 02:33:41.399 align:start position:0%
ready to go and then we rolled it out
 
02:33:43.870 --> 02:33:43.880 align:start position:0%
when it became effective so it's okay to
 
02:33:46.790 --> 02:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
give uh you know a significant Runway of
 
02:33:49.870 --> 02:33:49.880 align:start position:0%
a year if it's appropriate
 
02:33:53.670 --> 02:33:53.680 align:start position:0%
but that's something to to be mindful
 
02:33:57.710 --> 02:33:57.720 align:start position:0%
of other areas of information um dep
 
02:33:59.750 --> 02:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
Department website does have an enormous
 
02:34:02.309 --> 02:34:02.319 align:start position:0%
amount of information it does have
 
02:34:05.510 --> 02:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
access to the rules and we could go into
 
02:34:07.990 --> 02:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
the rules in more detail the general
 
02:34:12.230 --> 02:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
court website also has the laws and it
 
02:34:15.550 --> 02:34:15.560 align:start position:0%
has the rules there are countless rules
 
02:34:19.110 --> 02:34:19.120 align:start position:0%
that the department has governing almost
 
02:34:20.910 --> 02:34:20.920 align:start position:0%
every area of the section whether it's
 
02:34:24.590 --> 02:34:24.600 align:start position:0%
home education or special education or
 
02:34:28.070 --> 02:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
CTE all of those are going to have
 
02:34:30.070 --> 02:34:30.080 align:start position:0%
rules and you can find those on the
 
02:34:31.670 --> 02:34:31.680 align:start position:0%
general court website you can find them
 
02:34:33.670 --> 02:34:33.680 align:start position:0%
on the department
 
02:34:36.349 --> 02:34:36.359 align:start position:0%
website every year the department does a
 
02:34:38.990 --> 02:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
legislative summary so if you are
 
02:34:41.070 --> 02:34:41.080 align:start position:0%
curious as to what happened in Prior
 
02:34:43.429 --> 02:34:43.439 align:start position:0%
years the legislative summaries are on
 
02:34:45.550 --> 02:34:45.560 align:start position:0%
our website I'm happy to provide those
 
02:34:48.469 --> 02:34:48.479 align:start position:0%
to you we also have technical advisories
 
02:34:50.750 --> 02:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
we do not issue technical advisories on
 
02:34:53.150 --> 02:34:53.160 align:start position:0%
every law that has passed but any law
 
02:34:55.710 --> 02:34:55.720 align:start position:0%
that we feel the field would benefit
 
02:34:58.230 --> 02:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
from guidance on or there's might be
 
02:35:00.870 --> 02:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
some confusion um we will issue a
 
02:35:02.790 --> 02:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
technical advisory on and you can find
 
02:35:04.070 --> 02:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
those on our
 
02:35:06.790 --> 02:35:06.800 align:start position:0%
website so we talked about a couple of
 
02:35:09.670 --> 02:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
them um restraint and seclusion we
 
02:35:12.429 --> 02:35:12.439 align:start position:0%
always issue technical advisories
 
02:35:16.910 --> 02:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
on any changes to 18911 the Civics and
 
02:35:19.309 --> 02:35:19.319 align:start position:0%
government law we always issue technical
 
02:35:23.710 --> 02:35:23.720 align:start position:0%
advisor on and if there's an area um
 
02:35:25.670 --> 02:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
that anyone would like a technical
 
02:35:27.870 --> 02:35:27.880 align:start position:0%
advisory on we're always open to taking
 
02:35:29.870 --> 02:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
requests and we'll consider whether
 
02:35:31.990 --> 02:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
whether we can do that um so it's kind
 
02:35:34.150 --> 02:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
of an ongoing conversation but the list
 
02:35:37.630 --> 02:35:37.640 align:start position:0%
of technical advisories goes back years
 
02:35:39.870 --> 02:35:39.880 align:start position:0%
so my only caveat is to be mindful that
 
02:35:43.030 --> 02:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
it is still relevant and still
 
02:35:43.040 --> 02:35:47.870 align:start position:0%
it is still relevant and still
applicable

02:35:47.870 --> 02:35:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:50.910 --> 02:35:50.920 align:start position:0%
law I think that's all I have and that
 
02:35:54.349 --> 02:35:54.359 align:start position:0%
is um a picture of my favorite lawyer uh
 
02:35:57.150 --> 02:35:57.160 align:start position:0%
on the slide there so I'm happy to take
 
02:35:59.790 --> 02:35:59.800 align:start position:0%
any questions I'm happy to take a moment
 
02:36:01.990 --> 02:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
to go into our website if you think that
 
02:36:03.469 --> 02:36:03.479 align:start position:0%
that would be helpful but I also know
 
02:36:06.230 --> 02:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
you have an afternoon ahead of you of
 
02:36:08.590 --> 02:36:08.600 align:start position:0%
hearing some bills and I've never heard
 
02:36:11.870 --> 02:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
anyone complain of extra time for lunch
 
02:36:15.710 --> 02:36:15.720 align:start position:0%
so well thank you very much very uh
 
02:36:19.030 --> 02:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
informative um for all of us um any any
 
02:36:19.040 --> 02:36:20.230 align:start position:0%
informative um for all of us um any any
questions

02:36:20.230 --> 02:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:36:22.790 --> 02:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
for Miss Venton
 
02:36:27.670 --> 02:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
um uh but uh we will see her quite often
 
02:36:29.550 --> 02:36:29.560 align:start position:0%
yes um I have the cheap seats in the
 
02:36:31.429 --> 02:36:31.439 align:start position:0%
back so right I just wanted to follow up
 
02:36:33.710 --> 02:36:33.720 align:start position:0%
with a couple of things um one we
 
02:36:35.710 --> 02:36:35.720 align:start position:0%
talking about the references and
 
02:36:37.790 --> 02:36:37.800 align:start position:0%
amendments that you'll see in there I
 
02:36:40.870 --> 02:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to mention we also have uh Gen 4
 
02:36:43.710 --> 02:36:43.720 align:start position:0%
is our committee researcher so if the
 
02:36:46.550 --> 02:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
committee wants research done Jen will
 
02:36:49.550 --> 02:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
do that for us but we each have individ
 
02:36:52.630 --> 02:36:52.640 align:start position:0%
ual research is available in legislative
 
02:36:57.070 --> 02:36:57.080 align:start position:0%
services so you can go to OS research
 
02:37:00.150 --> 02:37:00.160 align:start position:0%
section and put in a request for
 
02:37:02.670 --> 02:37:02.680 align:start position:0%
research for them to do and they will do
 
02:37:04.870 --> 02:37:04.880 align:start position:0%
that for you I had one request I can't
 
02:37:07.150 --> 02:37:07.160 align:start position:0%
remember what was for but they went back
 
02:37:07.160 --> 02:37:08.950 align:start position:0%
remember what was for but they went back
to

02:37:08.950 --> 02:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:37:12.830 --> 02:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
1860 for me looking at for information
 
02:37:12.840 --> 02:37:14.269 align:start position:0%
1860 for me looking at for information
about

02:37:14.269 --> 02:37:14.279 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:37:16.630 --> 02:37:16.640 align:start position:0%
legislation um so that's a great
 
02:37:20.469 --> 02:37:20.479 align:start position:0%
resource also and um
 
02:37:24.830 --> 02:37:24.840 align:start position:0%
uh these books um are extremely valuable
 
02:37:29.790 --> 02:37:29.800 align:start position:0%
as you have heard um and I I guarantee
 
02:37:32.750 --> 02:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
right now they still fit in our drawers
 
02:37:35.030 --> 02:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
in our office um I don't know how many
 
02:37:38.630 --> 02:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
more years that'll uh before we have to
 
02:37:40.990 --> 02:37:41.000 align:start position:0%
get new drawers but um you know they
 
02:37:43.870 --> 02:37:43.880 align:start position:0%
still fit and I will also mention we do
 
02:37:46.550 --> 02:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
have I I don't it probably won't come to
 
02:37:49.950 --> 02:37:49.960 align:start position:0%
us but for the second or third time
 
02:37:53.670 --> 02:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
there is legislation to re Rec codify
 
02:37:56.710 --> 02:37:56.720 align:start position:0%
the education statutes to revamp them
 
02:37:59.670 --> 02:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
because um one example that Miss Venton
 
02:38:02.790 --> 02:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
pointed out was uh the change for the
 
02:38:07.269 --> 02:38:07.279 align:start position:0%
special education uh ages to 21
 
02:38:11.429 --> 02:38:11.439 align:start position:0%
inclusive rather than to age 21 and
 
02:38:14.469 --> 02:38:14.479 align:start position:0%
we've had to go back two or three times
 
02:38:17.830 --> 02:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
to amend other sections to change it to
 
02:38:20.269 --> 02:38:20.279 align:start position:0%
21 inclusive
 
02:38:23.230 --> 02:38:23.240 align:start position:0%
um because they were missed um so
 
02:38:25.429 --> 02:38:25.439 align:start position:0%
hopefully the problem with
 
02:38:30.309 --> 02:38:30.319 align:start position:0%
recodification is um who wants to do it
 
02:38:32.990 --> 02:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
who wants to go through this thing um
 
02:38:36.469 --> 02:38:36.479 align:start position:0%
any money involved yes
 
02:38:40.830 --> 02:38:40.840 align:start position:0%
okay not that much um but uh there is
 
02:38:43.469 --> 02:38:43.479 align:start position:0%
another bill to do that and um the
 
02:38:46.710 --> 02:38:46.720 align:start position:0%
possibility of some former OS uh people
 
02:38:49.190 --> 02:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
to to do that work so um we'll see what
 
02:38:52.389 --> 02:38:52.399 align:start position:0%
happens happens with that
 
02:38:55.269 --> 02:38:55.279 align:start position:0%
um anything else
 
02:38:59.630 --> 02:38:59.640 align:start position:0%
um and just very briefly if I may um
 
02:39:03.110 --> 02:39:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:06.790 --> 02:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
provision it's probably worth looking at
 
02:39:08.469 --> 02:39:08.479 align:start position:0%
when it was first passed looking at that
 
02:39:10.910 --> 02:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment section there are some areas
 
02:39:12.990 --> 02:39:13.000 align:start position:0%
as we have talked about that are looked
 
02:39:15.190 --> 02:39:15.200 align:start position:0%
at just about every every legislative
 
02:39:17.830 --> 02:39:17.840 align:start position:0%
session and then there are other areas
 
02:39:19.590 --> 02:39:19.600 align:start position:0%
we have a a law currently on the books
 
02:39:22.710 --> 02:39:22.720 align:start position:0%
that was passed in like
 
02:39:26.150 --> 02:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
1929 and but we are still held
 
02:39:28.349 --> 02:39:28.359 align:start position:0%
accountable to that law passed in 1929
 
02:39:31.590 --> 02:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
and we had a situation recently where um
 
02:39:33.070 --> 02:39:33.080 align:start position:0%
I think the secretary States I'm trying
 
02:39:35.110 --> 02:39:35.120 align:start position:0%
to find it here and I'm I'm not
 
02:39:37.469 --> 02:39:37.479 align:start position:0%
successful in finding it of course uh
 
02:39:39.550 --> 02:39:39.560 align:start position:0%
which is just the right the way of the
 
02:39:42.990 --> 02:39:43.000 align:start position:0%
world but there was a law passed in 1929
 
02:39:45.790 --> 02:39:45.800 align:start position:0%
or 1932 and the secretary of state has
 
02:39:47.990 --> 02:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
to hand the department written
 
02:39:50.750 --> 02:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
constitutions and we to provide those we
 
02:39:52.950 --> 02:39:52.960 align:start position:0%
meet that obligation we had a citizen
 
02:39:55.349 --> 02:39:55.359 align:start position:0%
call us to say what are you doing to be
 
02:39:58.150 --> 02:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
in compliance with this law and there
 
02:39:59.910 --> 02:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
had never been another amendment passed
 
02:40:02.190 --> 02:40:02.200 align:start position:0%
to it it's just been quietly sitting in
 
02:40:05.030 --> 02:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
the lawbook and we met Our obligation by
 
02:40:07.630 --> 02:40:07.640 align:start position:0%
providing that information online I find
 
02:40:09.870 --> 02:40:09.880 align:start position:0%
it fascinating and again this is why no
 
02:40:12.550 --> 02:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
one hangs out with me but the law says
 
02:40:15.469 --> 02:40:15.479 align:start position:0%
lawbooks and now the Technology's
 
02:40:17.070 --> 02:40:17.080 align:start position:0%
changed so much that we can meet that
 
02:40:18.830 --> 02:40:18.840 align:start position:0%
obligation by doing it online but that's
 
02:40:21.070 --> 02:40:21.080 align:start position:0%
just something to keep in mind as we
 
02:40:22.910 --> 02:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
look at that recodification of just
 
02:40:25.750 --> 02:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
making sure that the laws are current
 
02:40:28.269 --> 02:40:28.279 align:start position:0%
and I would be remiss if I did not um
 
02:40:30.630 --> 02:40:30.640 align:start position:0%
also just highlight for you again we've
 
02:40:33.950 --> 02:40:33.960 align:start position:0%
talked about asking what is the proposed
 
02:40:35.830 --> 02:40:35.840 align:start position:0%
Bill trying to do is it creating a new
 
02:40:38.150 --> 02:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
section is it repealing is it amendment
 
02:40:41.030 --> 02:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
is it amending look
 
02:40:44.190 --> 02:40:44.200 align:start position:0%
for forgive me as I get up here look for
 
02:40:47.110 --> 02:40:47.120 align:start position:0%
the strikeouts and the Bold
 
02:40:49.630 --> 02:40:49.640 align:start position:0%
italics that lets you know so you can
 
02:40:52.110 --> 02:40:52.120 align:start position:0%
have a proposed bill that's many pages
 
02:40:55.510 --> 02:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
in length and each section will be doing
 
02:40:58.070 --> 02:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
something different so there might be a
 
02:41:00.389 --> 02:41:00.399 align:start position:0%
section that's repealing something there
 
02:41:03.630 --> 02:41:03.640 align:start position:0%
might be another section that's amending
 
02:41:06.190 --> 02:41:06.200 align:start position:0%
and you're going to see it with the Bold
 
02:41:09.110 --> 02:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
italics so it's very you have to be
 
02:41:10.630 --> 02:41:10.640 align:start position:0%
really careful to just read what each
 
02:41:13.349 --> 02:41:13.359 align:start position:0%
section is doing um because I certainly
 
02:41:14.870 --> 02:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
have fallen into that trap where I
 
02:41:17.110 --> 02:41:17.120 align:start position:0%
haven't read it carefully um but those
 
02:41:19.070 --> 02:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
are some of the key things to look for
 
02:41:21.510 --> 02:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
the strikeouts and the repealing
 
02:41:25.190 --> 02:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:27.950 --> 02:41:27.960 align:start position:0%
italics great thank you thank you very
 
02:41:30.230 --> 02:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
much we really appreciate your time the
 
02:41:33.990 --> 02:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
session um before we actually Break um
 
02:41:37.030 --> 02:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
representative Snodgrass um uh we went
 
02:41:39.429 --> 02:41:39.439 align:start position:0%
around and introduced ourselves um be
 
02:41:40.910 --> 02:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
glad to have you introduce yourself
 
02:41:43.150 --> 02:41:43.160 align:start position:0%
before we break
 
02:41:53.190 --> 02:41:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:56.309 --> 02:41:56.319 align:start position:0%
um I was previously I was executive
 
02:41:58.510 --> 02:41:58.520 align:start position:0%
director of a nonprofit educational
 
02:42:00.870 --> 02:42:00.880 align:start position:0%
Corporation Called second start that
 
02:42:03.750 --> 02:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
operated in conquer for lots of
 
02:42:06.349 --> 02:42:06.359 align:start position:0%
populations that that needed additional
 
02:42:08.469 --> 02:42:08.479 align:start position:0%
assistance adults that hadn't finished
 
02:42:11.510 --> 02:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
high school um refugees needing English
 
02:42:13.710 --> 02:42:13.720 align:start position:0%
as a second language um we had an
 
02:42:16.309 --> 02:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
alternative high school program for kids
 
02:42:19.429 --> 02:42:19.439 align:start position:0%
that weren't uh making it in the public
 
02:42:22.070 --> 02:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
schools um we also had drug and alcohol
 
02:42:24.710 --> 02:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
counselors out in schools and we had a
 
02:42:27.150 --> 02:42:27.160 align:start position:0%
daycare center so it was a fairly
 
02:42:29.469 --> 02:42:29.479 align:start position:0%
comprehensive program and I did that for
 
02:42:34.349 --> 02:42:34.359 align:start position:0%
48 years and decided it was enough so um
 
02:42:38.110 --> 02:42:38.120 align:start position:0%
I was asked if I would consider um
 
02:42:42.190 --> 02:42:42.200 align:start position:0%
running for the house and um here I
 
02:42:48.110 --> 02:42:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:34.150 --> 02:43:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:37.510 --> 02:43:37.520 align:start position:0%

that distinction hopefully the first
 
04:33:28.510 --> 04:33:28.520 align:start position:0%
bill of the committee will pass out of
 
04:33:30.670 --> 04:33:30.680 align:start position:0%
this committee as well um that's the
 
04:33:32.670 --> 04:33:32.680 align:start position:0%
plan anyways so for the record my name
 
04:33:34.551 --> 04:33:34.561 align:start position:0%
is representative Joe Alexander um this
 
04:33:36.590 --> 04:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
is my fourth term I serve the town of
 
04:33:39.429 --> 04:33:39.439 align:start position:0%
gtown um I filed this bill on behalf of
 
04:33:42.109 --> 04:33:42.119 align:start position:0%
my SAU which is SAU 19 they represent go
 
04:33:45.750 --> 04:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
toown in New Boston um I I'd like to
 
04:33:47.189 --> 04:33:47.199 align:start position:0%
introduce this it's basically enabling
 
04:33:48.949 --> 04:33:48.959 align:start position:0%
legislation that follows What towns can
 
04:33:50.910 --> 04:33:50.920 align:start position:0%
already do um which gives school
 
04:33:52.510 --> 04:33:52.520 align:start position:0%
districts the same opportunity to have
 
04:33:54.551 --> 04:33:54.561 align:start position:0%
voters in their Community decide to
 
04:33:56.590 --> 04:33:56.600 align:start position:0%
appoint a school district Treasurer
 
04:33:59.429 --> 04:33:59.439 align:start position:0%
instead of electing one um I sponsored
 
04:34:01.070 --> 04:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
it on their behalf and it's my
 
04:34:02.310 --> 04:34:02.320 align:start position:0%
understanding I have my business
 
04:34:03.990 --> 04:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
administrator here to answer technical
 
04:34:05.990 --> 04:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
questions but this is really enabling
 
04:34:07.510 --> 04:34:07.520 align:start position:0%
legislation voters can choose to put it
 
04:34:09.910 --> 04:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
on the ballot um and then that process
 
04:34:11.709 --> 04:34:11.719 align:start position:0%
can be changed if it passes on town
 
04:34:14.789 --> 04:34:14.799 align:start position:0%
warrant on town meeting day so with that
 
04:34:18.670 --> 04:34:18.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:21.029 --> 04:34:21.039 align:start position:0%
questions representative Cornell so the
 
04:34:22.869 --> 04:34:22.879 align:start position:0%
treasurer is just a treasurer for the
 
04:34:24.109 --> 04:34:24.119 align:start position:0%
school district because I know in
 
04:34:25.670 --> 04:34:25.680 align:start position:0%
Manchester we have a Treasurer but it's
 
04:34:27.510 --> 04:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
for every city department so it's
 
04:34:28.750 --> 04:34:28.760 align:start position:0%
different so this is just for the
 
04:34:30.269 --> 04:34:30.279 align:start position:0%
schools yeah that's a great question
 
04:34:32.269 --> 04:34:32.279 align:start position:0%
currently there's a a school and a town
 
04:34:34.390 --> 04:34:34.400 align:start position:0%
Treasurer so this would just bring towns
 
04:34:35.910 --> 04:34:35.920 align:start position:0%
in line where they can both have the
 
04:34:38.150 --> 04:34:38.160 align:start position:0%
same opportunity to appoint a Treasurer
 
04:34:40.349 --> 04:34:40.359 align:start position:0%
relative instead of electing one um so
 
04:34:42.510 --> 04:34:42.520 align:start position:0%
for instance some towns may choose to do
 
04:34:44.310 --> 04:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
one or the other but goof toown for
 
04:34:46.470 --> 04:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
instance has two we have a town in
 
04:34:50.310 --> 04:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
school thank you welcome representative
 
04:34:52.470 --> 04:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
selling thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
04:34:55.510 --> 04:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question just to clarify um
 
04:34:57.510 --> 04:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
because I got a little confused in there
 
04:34:59.990 --> 04:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
so this would bring the issue before the
 
04:35:02.429 --> 04:35:02.439 align:start position:0%
voters of a town so that they would vote
 
04:35:05.349 --> 04:35:05.359 align:start position:0%
on having their treasur be appointed
 
04:35:07.830 --> 04:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
supposed as opposed to yes voting on the
 
04:35:10.029 --> 04:35:10.039 align:start position:0%
treasure yes so this could be submitted
 
04:35:11.949 --> 04:35:11.959 align:start position:0%
by either petition warrant article or
 
04:35:13.390 --> 04:35:13.400 align:start position:0%
the school board may choose to put this
 
04:35:15.590 --> 04:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
on as a as a procedural change and then
 
04:35:18.070 --> 04:35:18.080 align:start position:0%
the voters will at on town meeting day
 
04:35:22.670 --> 04:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:26.109 --> 04:35:26.119 align:start position:0%
that yes represent LEL thank you and
 
04:35:28.750 --> 04:35:28.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question can you
 
04:35:30.189 --> 04:35:30.199 align:start position:0%
I just want you to help me understand if
 
04:35:32.750 --> 04:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
you could I thought right now as it
 
04:35:34.189 --> 04:35:34.199 align:start position:0%
stands you can have someone on the
 
04:35:35.830 --> 04:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
ballot and then if someone doesn't run
 
04:35:38.150 --> 04:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
for the position or if they resign then
 
04:35:40.310 --> 04:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
they can be appointed is that
 
04:35:45.470 --> 04:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:48.869 --> 04:35:48.879 align:start position:0%
you any further questions from the
 
04:35:52.551 --> 04:35:52.561 align:start position:0%
committee uh seen none um You probably
 
04:35:54.029 --> 04:35:54.039 align:start position:0%
be one of the shortest testimonies of
 
04:35:56.150 --> 04:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
the year as well you know and short and
 
04:35:58.150 --> 04:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
sweet and to the point right thank you
 
04:35:58.160 --> 04:36:02.590 align:start position:0%
sweet and to the point right thank you
very

04:36:02.590 --> 04:36:02.600 align:start position:0%

much and we have Mr gross from go down
 
04:36:09.429 --> 04:36:09.439 align:start position:0%

04:36:12.150 --> 04:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
superintendent business administrator I

04:36:18.629 --> 04:36:18.639 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman and and thank
 
04:36:21.429 --> 04:36:21.439 align:start position:0%
uh you folks on the committee um I did
 
04:36:24.670 --> 04:36:24.680 align:start position:0%
uh ask or we did ask at sau9 uh
 
04:36:27.310 --> 04:36:27.320 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander to sponsor this
 
04:36:29.189 --> 04:36:29.199 align:start position:0%
leg this enabling
 
04:36:32.150 --> 04:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
legislation and um I first want to say
 
04:36:34.789 --> 04:36:34.799 align:start position:0%
that I I hope that this is perceived as
 
04:36:38.349 --> 04:36:38.359 align:start position:0%
a bipartisan Common Sense enabling
 
04:36:40.510 --> 04:36:40.520 align:start position:0%
legislation uh first and foremost I want
 
04:36:42.470 --> 04:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
to thank representative Alexander for
 
04:36:44.830 --> 04:36:44.840 align:start position:0%
sponsoring this bill and for being here
 
04:36:47.429 --> 04:36:47.439 align:start position:0%
today you know why is this legislation
 
04:36:51.070 --> 04:36:51.080 align:start position:0%
important um simply put and it was
 
04:36:53.029 --> 04:36:53.039 align:start position:0%
clarified I I Believe by representative
 
04:36:57.150 --> 04:36:57.160 align:start position:0%
Cornell that in uh cities you you might
 
04:36:59.551 --> 04:36:59.561 align:start position:0%
have one person but in many communities
 
04:37:02.789 --> 04:37:02.799 align:start position:0%
you have a school and a town Treasurer
 
04:37:06.750 --> 04:37:06.760 align:start position:0%
the legislation uh was was aorded couple
 
04:37:08.709 --> 04:37:08.719 align:start position:0%
of decades ago which would allow towns
 
04:37:11.070 --> 04:37:11.080 align:start position:0%
the ability to vote on having an
 
04:37:13.869 --> 04:37:13.879 align:start position:0%
appointed Treasurer so in gtown there is
 
04:37:16.109 --> 04:37:16.119 align:start position:0%
an appointed Treasurer from the town
 
04:37:18.510 --> 04:37:18.520 align:start position:0%
side but there is no ability to do that
 
04:37:20.590 --> 04:37:20.600 align:start position:0%
on the school side and arguably the
 
04:37:22.551 --> 04:37:22.561 align:start position:0%
school's budget the numbers of
 
04:37:24.590 --> 04:37:24.600 align:start position:0%
transactions are probably double that of
 
04:37:27.670 --> 04:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
the town but yet we are um challenged
 
04:37:29.109 --> 04:37:29.119 align:start position:0%
sometimes uh with respect to that
 
04:37:31.670 --> 04:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
because there are times when you have to
 
04:37:33.189 --> 04:37:33.199 align:start position:0%
release payments that are out of
 
04:37:34.789 --> 04:37:34.799 align:start position:0%
sequence and you have to get a hold of a
 
04:37:37.230 --> 04:37:37.240 align:start position:0%
Treasurer the treasurer might be on
 
04:37:40.470 --> 04:37:40.480 align:start position:0%
vacation uh Etc and it becomes a
 
04:37:43.590 --> 04:37:43.600 align:start position:0%
challenge uh in that respect so um I
 
04:37:46.590 --> 04:37:46.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to just also share with you um as
 
04:37:49.390 --> 04:37:49.400 align:start position:0%
I see that you have um the books of all
 
04:37:52.551 --> 04:37:52.561 align:start position:0%
of the rsas the treasurer duties is uh
 
04:37:55.789 --> 04:37:55.799 align:start position:0%
for schools is 197 col
 
04:37:59.949 --> 04:37:59.959 align:start position:0%
23-a treasurers duties and they are
 
04:38:03.709 --> 04:38:03.719 align:start position:0%
voluminous um and many of these
 
04:38:06.109 --> 04:38:06.119 align:start position:0%
functions are done by the business
 
04:38:07.990 --> 04:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
office and the business operations and
 
04:38:09.789 --> 04:38:09.799 align:start position:0%
they're kind of reviewed by the
 
04:38:12.429 --> 04:38:12.439 align:start position:0%
treasurer um but the duties of a
 
04:38:14.990 --> 04:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
treasurer for a town in this case a
 
04:38:18.709 --> 04:38:18.719 align:start position:0%
school are massive um they are largely
 
04:38:21.269 --> 04:38:21.279 align:start position:0%
done by business offices or Finance
 
04:38:24.269 --> 04:38:24.279 align:start position:0%
offices across New Hampshire and the
 
04:38:27.910 --> 04:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
requirements and the um accounting Savvy
 
04:38:30.510 --> 04:38:30.520 align:start position:0%
the finance Savvy that is needed um I
 
04:38:32.629 --> 04:38:32.639 align:start position:0%
think it suits it uh suits us a little
 
04:38:34.910 --> 04:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
better for communities to have the
 
04:38:37.429 --> 04:38:37.439 align:start position:0%
ability to a point um not to say that
 
04:38:39.709 --> 04:38:39.719 align:start position:0%
they will but at least give them the
 
04:38:42.230 --> 04:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity give School school districts
 
04:38:44.349 --> 04:38:44.359 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to have their voters
 
04:38:46.510 --> 04:38:46.520 align:start position:0%
decide whether they wish to have their
 
04:38:48.070 --> 04:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
Treasurer appointed so I think that's
 
04:38:49.510 --> 04:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
the nice thing about enabling
 
04:38:52.789 --> 04:38:52.799 align:start position:0%
legislation it does give that choice to
 
04:38:53.910 --> 04:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
uh to those
 
04:38:56.629 --> 04:38:56.639 align:start position:0%
communities um and you know again I just
 
04:39:00.310 --> 04:39:00.320 align:start position:0%
want to reemphasize that um timel I also
 
04:39:01.830 --> 04:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
want to stress that we have two very
 
04:39:04.750 --> 04:39:04.760 align:start position:0%
good treasurers right now um they do a f
 
04:39:07.269 --> 04:39:07.279 align:start position:0%
a really really good job I will also
 
04:39:09.429 --> 04:39:09.439 align:start position:0%
state that both of them have Finance
 
04:39:11.390 --> 04:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
backgrounds and accounting backgrounds
 
04:39:13.750 --> 04:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
friends um that has not always been the
 
04:39:17.349 --> 04:39:17.359 align:start position:0%
case in my uh job okay so I'm really
 
04:39:20.310 --> 04:39:20.320 align:start position:0%
blessed but part of anything is planning
 
04:39:21.990 --> 04:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
for the future and planning for the
 
04:39:24.670 --> 04:39:24.680 align:start position:0%
future I think these jobs require people
 
04:39:27.029 --> 04:39:27.039 align:start position:0%
to have these set skill sets we're
 
04:39:28.830 --> 04:39:28.840 align:start position:0%
blessed to have two people that do but
 
04:39:30.269 --> 04:39:30.279 align:start position:0%
that might not be the case in one year
 
04:39:33.750 --> 04:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
or 10 years from now so that was
 
04:39:36.709 --> 04:39:36.719 align:start position:0%
it thank you very much uh yes

representative Terry thanks uh I'm I'm
 
04:39:41.788 --> 04:39:41.798 align:start position:0%
not seeing a lot of of a other people
 
04:39:45.070 --> 04:39:45.080 align:start position:0%
here to testify today I'm not seeing any
 
04:39:49.110 --> 04:39:49.120 align:start position:0%
uh Pink cards so I'm just interested to
 
04:39:51.470 --> 04:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
know from you whether you have spoken
 
04:39:53.230 --> 04:39:53.240 align:start position:0%
with colleagues and other communities
 
04:39:54.788 --> 04:39:54.798 align:start position:0%
throughout the state and whether you
 
04:39:56.750 --> 04:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
have some sense from them as to whether
 
04:39:58.390 --> 04:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
they would be favorably disposed or
 
04:40:00.190 --> 04:40:00.200 align:start position:0%
really would like something like this in
 
04:40:02.550 --> 04:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
addition to you in your school district
 
04:40:06.868 --> 04:40:06.878 align:start position:0%
sure um I belong to an association as
 
04:40:09.230 --> 04:40:09.240 align:start position:0%
called the New Hampshire uh administ
 
04:40:10.788 --> 04:40:10.798 align:start position:0%
business administrators Association
 
04:40:14.390 --> 04:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
essentially and um they they don't Lobby
 
04:40:16.030 --> 04:40:16.040 align:start position:0%
they don't take official votes on
 
04:40:18.350 --> 04:40:18.360 align:start position:0%
legislation I can tell you anecdotally
 
04:40:20.910 --> 04:40:20.920 align:start position:0%
in conversations that I have had with my
 
04:40:24.230 --> 04:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
peers that um this type of legislation
 
04:40:26.590 --> 04:40:26.600 align:start position:0%
would be very helpful to them and it
 
04:40:29.390 --> 04:40:29.400 align:start position:0%
gives them the opportunity to have their
 
04:40:31.230 --> 04:40:31.240 align:start position:0%
Community make a decision to go that
 
04:40:32.628 --> 04:40:32.638 align:start position:0%
route and I think that's all that this
 
04:40:34.470 --> 04:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
legislation does it provides an
 
04:40:36.030 --> 04:40:36.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity for a community to
 
04:40:37.990 --> 04:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
collectively decide whether they'd like
 
04:40:43.150 --> 04:40:43.160 align:start position:0%
to have an appointed Treasurer thank you
 
04:40:44.470 --> 04:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
04:40:46.750 --> 04:40:46.760 align:start position:0%
Bon thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
04:40:49.788 --> 04:40:49.798 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I'm just curious
 
04:40:53.190 --> 04:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
about uh the impetus for for this uh
 
04:40:56.310 --> 04:40:56.320 align:start position:0%
Bill normally uh your school district uh
 
04:40:59.830 --> 04:40:59.840 align:start position:0%
Treasurer is elected by the body is your
 
04:41:02.868 --> 04:41:02.878 align:start position:0%
concern that the uh uh the folks coming
 
04:41:05.390 --> 04:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
forward to be elected as treasure aren't
 
04:41:07.708 --> 04:41:07.718 align:start position:0%
necessarily qualified to do the
 
04:41:11.350 --> 04:41:11.360 align:start position:0%
job um I believe that if you look at the
 
04:41:13.430 --> 04:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
qualifications and the duties that are
 
04:41:15.350 --> 04:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
required under RSA
 
04:41:20.070 --> 04:41:20.080 align:start position:0%
19723 a are voluminous and they require
 
04:41:24.510 --> 04:41:24.520 align:start position:0%
individuals with a background in finance
 
04:41:27.670 --> 04:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
Andor accounting uh to perform the
 
04:41:31.390 --> 04:41:31.400 align:start position:0%
duties as been statutorily written um
 
04:41:34.030 --> 04:41:34.040 align:start position:0%
right now I think if you ask business
 
04:41:36.430 --> 04:41:36.440 align:start position:0%
administrators or town finance officials
 
04:41:39.550 --> 04:41:39.560 align:start position:0%
they will tell you um that largely this
 
04:41:41.430 --> 04:41:41.440 align:start position:0%
is done by staff of a school school
 
04:41:45.270 --> 04:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
district and signed off on by a
 
04:41:47.708 --> 04:41:47.718 align:start position:0%
Treasurer um but they're largely done
 
04:41:50.350 --> 04:41:50.360 align:start position:0%
when you're talking about massive Bank
 
04:41:53.628 --> 04:41:53.638 align:start position:0%
reconciliations um I can tell you that
 
04:41:53.638 --> 04:41:54.470 align:start position:0%
reconciliations um I can tell you that
our

04:41:54.470 --> 04:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
our
 
04:41:57.430 --> 04:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
treasurers um are sometimes three four
 
04:41:59.550 --> 04:41:59.560 align:start position:0%
months behind and it we we do them
 
04:42:02.830 --> 04:42:02.840 align:start position:0%
obviously you know one month back they
 
04:42:06.910 --> 04:42:06.920 align:start position:0%
could be three four five months back um
 
04:42:08.590 --> 04:42:08.600 align:start position:0%
if you're looking about who
 
04:42:11.788 --> 04:42:11.798 align:start position:0%
collateralized funds Etc the business
 
04:42:14.990 --> 04:42:15.000 align:start position:0%
office sets those not the treasurer so
 
04:42:16.510 --> 04:42:16.520 align:start position:0%
when you look at all the duties and I
 
04:42:18.470 --> 04:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
would encourage you to just take a look
 
04:42:22.390 --> 04:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
at 197 colon 23A and you'll see that
 
04:42:24.628 --> 04:42:24.638 align:start position:0%
more and more
 
04:42:26.788 --> 04:42:26.798 align:start position:0%
requirements dictate somebody with that
 
04:42:29.830 --> 04:42:29.840 align:start position:0%
with that skill set and um it also gives
 
04:42:31.948 --> 04:42:31.958 align:start position:0%
you the opportunity to if you did
 
04:42:33.910 --> 04:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
appoint um you would be able to
 
04:42:36.708 --> 04:42:36.718 align:start position:0%
determine does that person possess those
 
04:42:39.590 --> 04:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
skills I can tell you from gtown we have
 
04:42:42.150 --> 04:42:42.160 align:start position:0%
an appointed treasur that appointed
 
04:42:44.390 --> 04:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
Treasurer also happens to be an employee
 
04:42:46.350 --> 04:42:46.360 align:start position:0%
of the town in the in their finance
 
04:42:48.190 --> 04:42:48.200 align:start position:0%
office and that person is very
 
04:42:50.270 --> 04:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
well-versed in all of the requirements
 
04:42:52.868 --> 04:42:52.878 align:start position:0%
so it it's quite helpful to to know that
 
04:42:54.670 --> 04:42:54.680 align:start position:0%
and have that trust if we're truly
 
04:42:57.270 --> 04:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
looking at making sure that there is
 
04:42:59.708 --> 04:42:59.718 align:start position:0%
accountability of school finances and
 
04:43:02.788 --> 04:43:02.798 align:start position:0%
town finances this gives communities the
 
04:43:06.190 --> 04:43:06.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:09.708 --> 04:43:09.718 align:start position:0%
that yes U just a followup to that um I
 
04:43:11.110 --> 04:43:11.120 align:start position:0%
think you kind of answered it already so
 
04:43:12.830 --> 04:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
so it sounds like what you're looking at
 
04:43:16.070 --> 04:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
is your example being that you have a
 
04:43:18.990 --> 04:43:19.000 align:start position:0%
person in the town office that has those
 
04:43:21.270 --> 04:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
um abilities that now has been given
 
04:43:23.868 --> 04:43:23.878 align:start position:0%
those extra responsibilities typical the
 
04:43:27.628 --> 04:43:27.638 align:start position:0%
treasure in our school district is uh um
 
04:43:29.910 --> 04:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
reive some sort of stien so you're
 
04:43:31.510 --> 04:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
envisioning perhaps somebody within the
 
04:43:34.470 --> 04:43:34.480 align:start position:0%
school district just assuming those
 
04:43:38.550 --> 04:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
responsibilities with a statement um
 
04:43:41.708 --> 04:43:41.718 align:start position:0%
that is not always the case in terms of
 
04:43:44.628 --> 04:43:44.638 align:start position:0%
um if it is an employee of a finance
 
04:43:46.230 --> 04:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
office it could just be part of their
 
04:43:48.510 --> 04:43:48.520 align:start position:0%
duties there would not be any additional
 
04:43:51.830 --> 04:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
compensation so right now in the
 
04:43:53.990 --> 04:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
communities of Goffstown and New Boston
 
04:43:56.550 --> 04:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
the treasurers receive modest stipend to
 
04:43:59.868 --> 04:43:59.878 align:start position:0%
perform those duties um in Goffstown as
 
04:44:01.948 --> 04:44:01.958 align:start position:0%
I can't speak for any other municipality
 
04:44:04.470 --> 04:44:04.480 align:start position:0%
in the state the person who performs the
 
04:44:06.510 --> 04:44:06.520 align:start position:0%
duties of Treasurer on on behalf of the
 
04:44:08.990 --> 04:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
town of gtown is part of their job
 
04:44:11.350 --> 04:44:11.360 align:start position:0%
duties it is they are not receiving any
 
04:44:14.670 --> 04:44:14.680 align:start position:0%
extra compensation you could make a very
 
04:44:16.868 --> 04:44:16.878 align:start position:0%
stretch argument that it would save
 
04:44:19.150 --> 04:44:19.160 align:start position:0%
school districts or towns money because
 
04:44:20.590 --> 04:44:20.600 align:start position:0%
they would not have to provide that
 
04:44:20.600 --> 04:44:23.270 align:start position:0%
they would not have to provide that
modest

04:44:23.270 --> 04:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:26.230 --> 04:44:26.240 align:start position:0%
typend thank you
 
04:44:29.270 --> 04:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
okay yes representative litfield thank
 
04:44:31.430 --> 04:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
you thank you for taking my question
 
04:44:32.830 --> 04:44:32.840 align:start position:0%
could you give me a little bit of back
 
04:44:34.670 --> 04:44:34.680 align:start position:0%
or us a little bit of background on the
 
04:44:37.270 --> 04:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
history of why this was an elected
 
04:44:39.270 --> 04:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
position to begin with I I almost feel
 
04:44:40.708 --> 04:44:40.718 align:start position:0%
as though we're giving up a type of
 
04:44:43.150 --> 04:44:43.160 align:start position:0%
check in Balance here so I just want to
 
04:44:44.788 --> 04:44:44.798 align:start position:0%
understand what the history is behind
 
04:44:46.708 --> 04:44:46.718 align:start position:0%
this actually being elected
 
04:44:49.310 --> 04:44:49.320 align:start position:0%
unfortunately representative litfield I
 
04:44:51.628 --> 04:44:51.638 align:start position:0%
am not going to be I do not have that
 
04:44:55.070 --> 04:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
knowledge I I I did review the statute
 
04:44:59.230 --> 04:44:59.240 align:start position:0%
and it was first created in in the year
 
04:45:02.910 --> 04:45:02.920 align:start position:0%
1887 um and presumably at that time
 
04:45:05.910 --> 04:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
there were Ledger books and uh having
 
04:45:08.510 --> 04:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
seen The Archives of gtown and their
 
04:45:11.708 --> 04:45:11.718 align:start position:0%
Ledger books uh it was not a ton of work
 
04:45:14.590 --> 04:45:14.600 align:start position:0%
to do um the amount of financial
 
04:45:16.430 --> 04:45:16.440 align:start position:0%
transactions nowadays would would
 
04:45:20.390 --> 04:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
warrant it um I do believe that there
 
04:45:23.470 --> 04:45:23.480 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether or not a Treasurer
 
04:45:27.190 --> 04:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
is appointed by a community or uh the
 
04:45:29.110 --> 04:45:29.120 align:start position:0%
community allows for an appointment or
 
04:45:31.510 --> 04:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
whether it's an elected position the
 
04:45:33.070 --> 04:45:33.080 align:start position:0%
same duties and
 
04:45:35.510 --> 04:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
responsibilities um are enumerated in
 
04:45:38.230 --> 04:45:38.240 align:start position:0%
the statute and the checks and balances
 
04:45:41.470 --> 04:45:41.480 align:start position:0%
are numerous um uh School districts are
 
04:45:44.350 --> 04:45:44.360 align:start position:0%
required to have a financial audit every
 
04:45:48.070 --> 04:45:48.080 align:start position:0%
year um they have to provide uh finance
 
04:45:49.910 --> 04:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
and data reporting to the State
 
04:45:52.470 --> 04:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and there are
 
04:45:55.070 --> 04:45:55.080 align:start position:0%
numerous um things that communities do
 
04:45:58.110 --> 04:45:58.120 align:start position:0%
in terms of publishing data providing
 
04:46:01.990 --> 04:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
records so I believe just me personally
 
04:46:04.070 --> 04:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
that there would be sufficient checks
 
04:46:06.550 --> 04:46:06.560 align:start position:0%
and balances to ensure that there is
 
04:46:09.190 --> 04:46:09.200 align:start position:0%
transparency and accountability for an
 
04:46:10.510 --> 04:46:10.520 align:start position:0%
appointed Treasurer just like there
 
04:46:15.350 --> 04:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:19.590 --> 04:46:19.600 align:start position:0%
one any further questions oh yes repres
 
04:46:21.868 --> 04:46:21.878 align:start position:0%
Freeman thank you Mr chair thank you Mr
 
04:46:24.550 --> 04:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
gross for coming in front of us um in
 
04:46:26.910 --> 04:46:26.920 align:start position:0%
the event that this goes on the ballot
 
04:46:28.390 --> 04:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
and the voters have decided they'd
 
04:46:29.990 --> 04:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
rather have this as an appointed
 
04:46:31.670 --> 04:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
position as opposed to an elected
 
04:46:34.628 --> 04:46:34.638 align:start position:0%
position would there be any um would
 
04:46:36.910 --> 04:46:36.920 align:start position:0%
there be any lack of constituent
 
04:46:38.788 --> 04:46:38.798 align:start position:0%
services and what I'm trying to ask you
 
04:46:41.548 --> 04:46:41.558 align:start position:0%
is right now as an elected treasurer do
 
04:46:44.070 --> 04:46:44.080 align:start position:0%
they provide any constituent services
 
04:46:47.548 --> 04:46:47.558 align:start position:0%
and would they lose any being
 
04:46:50.628 --> 04:46:50.638 align:start position:0%
appointed in my opinion this is my
 
04:46:53.350 --> 04:46:53.360 align:start position:0%
seventh year uh working for a school
 
04:46:54.830 --> 04:46:54.840 align:start position:0%
district I worked in the private sector
 
04:46:58.030 --> 04:46:58.040 align:start position:0%
for the 29 years prior to that um this

the treasurer Pro and the two treasurers

any reason to provide constituent type

there were any any right to no requests
 
04:47:14.470 --> 04:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
or if there was any you know federal
 
04:47:17.390 --> 04:47:17.400 align:start position:0%
information requests that all comes to a
 
04:47:20.910 --> 04:47:20.920 align:start position:0%
business office or a finance office so I
 
04:47:23.670 --> 04:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
don't recall uh treasurers ever holding
 
04:47:26.150 --> 04:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
office hours or anything else like that
 
04:47:28.110 --> 04:47:28.120 align:start position:0%

116
 
05:16:08.590 --> 05:16:08.600 align:start position:0%
hp16 basically at its core if you if you
 
05:16:10.750 --> 05:16:10.760 align:start position:0%
look at the text it just jumps out at
 
05:16:14.070 --> 05:16:14.080 align:start position:0%
you on uh on the page where all the bold
 
05:16:18.788 --> 05:16:18.798 align:start position:0%
letters say uh public Academy and uh to
 
05:16:20.670 --> 05:16:20.680 align:start position:0%
put that into
 
05:16:24.190 --> 05:16:24.200 align:start position:0%
context you already are aware I'm sure
 
05:16:25.708 --> 05:16:25.718 align:start position:0%
um that we
 
05:16:32.390 --> 05:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
have um RSA 198 colon 4-D Delta uh
 
05:16:35.510 --> 05:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
reports required in that all of our
 
05:16:38.390 --> 05:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
governing uh School boards are required
 
05:16:40.590 --> 05:16:40.600 align:start position:0%
to provide provide some financial
 
05:16:41.990 --> 05:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
reporting and
 
05:16:45.390 --> 05:16:45.400 align:start position:0%
disclosure um because uh Pinkerton
 
05:16:50.590 --> 05:16:50.600 align:start position:0%
Academy is U uh quasi public mostly
 
05:16:53.670 --> 05:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
private uh institution they were not
 
05:16:58.150 --> 05:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
covered by this RSA so what this RSA uh
 
05:17:03.030 --> 05:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
uh proposes is that we ask Pinkerton to
 
05:17:05.030 --> 05:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh complete the same sort of um
 
05:17:07.310 --> 05:17:07.320 align:start position:0%
Financial disclosure and and financial
 
05:17:11.110 --> 05:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
transparency reports as public schools
 
05:17:13.830 --> 05:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
so that that was that was the initial
 
05:17:17.190 --> 05:17:17.200 align:start position:0%
Direction and concept in the last uh few

what the information needs of uh ABS and
 
05:17:46.310 --> 05:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
the other schools that serve that
 
05:17:49.910 --> 05:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
Pinkerton serves um so that the school
 
05:17:53.150 --> 05:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
board can access the information that
 
05:17:55.190 --> 05:17:55.200 align:start position:0%

Powers uh has thinks that all the
 
05:18:04.750 --> 05:18:04.760 align:start position:0%
information that's in this standard
 
05:18:08.868 --> 05:18:08.878 align:start position:0%
report is already available um but it's
 
05:18:11.510 --> 05:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
in a different sequence and format and
 
05:18:14.150 --> 05:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
maybe spread over one or two documents
 
05:18:16.830 --> 05:18:16.840 align:start position:0%
more than than what the the schools are
 
05:18:21.830 --> 05:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
are U expecting so um I think uh they've
 
05:18:23.708 --> 05:18:23.718 align:start position:0%
had a very productive conversation
 
05:18:25.350 --> 05:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
you're going to hear from them directly
 
05:18:28.830 --> 05:18:28.840 align:start position:0%
because they're here to testify and um
 
05:18:32.670 --> 05:18:32.680 align:start position:0%
my my position on this is that uh if if
 
05:18:34.548 --> 05:18:34.558 align:start position:0%
if they can work it out to where the
 
05:18:37.830 --> 05:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
information exchange is done and that we
 
05:18:40.190 --> 05:18:40.200 align:start position:0%
maintain trans transparency
 
05:18:42.670 --> 05:18:42.680 align:start position:0%
appropriately I I I'm happy with that
 
05:18:47.310 --> 05:18:47.320 align:start position:0%
I'm not really uh pushing to expand our
 
05:18:51.030 --> 05:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
statutes um or to extend our legal
 
05:18:53.788 --> 05:18:53.798 align:start position:0%
obligations to the private acmis but I
 
05:18:57.628 --> 05:18:57.638 align:start position:0%
do think that um Mr Powers is wanting to
 
05:19:00.708 --> 05:19:00.718 align:start position:0%
make sure that the data necessary is in
 
05:19:03.150 --> 05:19:03.160 align:start position:0%
fact available it's just a diff
 
05:19:05.390 --> 05:19:05.400 align:start position:0%
difference of opinion I think on format
 
05:19:08.030 --> 05:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
but but I don't want to go too much
 
05:19:10.628 --> 05:19:10.638 align:start position:0%
anticipated their testimony because
 
05:19:12.270 --> 05:19:12.280 align:start position:0%
that's why they're here and they're the
 
05:19:16.030 --> 05:19:16.040 align:start position:0%
experts and I know nothing so um except
 
05:19:18.190 --> 05:19:18.200 align:start position:0%
now I've told you everything I know uh
 
05:19:20.788 --> 05:19:20.798 align:start position:0%
please don't ask me any more questions
 
05:19:24.430 --> 05:19:24.440 align:start position:0%
but but I will if you want take
 
05:19:27.750 --> 05:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
questions um would anyone like to uh
 
05:19:31.350 --> 05:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
take him up uh on uh and embarrass him
 
05:19:31.360 --> 05:19:33.480 align:start position:0%
take him up uh on uh and embarrass him
publicly

05:19:33.480 --> 05:19:33.490 align:start position:0%
publicly
 
05:19:33.490 --> 05:19:37.628 align:start position:0%
publicly
[Laughter]

05:19:37.628 --> 05:19:37.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:39.390 --> 05:19:39.400 align:start position:0%
represent thank you for taking my
 
05:19:41.628 --> 05:19:41.638 align:start position:0%
question can you define what
 
05:19:44.110 --> 05:19:44.120 align:start position:0%
distinguishes an academy from a what
 
05:19:46.910 --> 05:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
makes a school an institution an academy
 
05:19:49.470 --> 05:19:49.480 align:start position:0%
so that is a great question and
 
05:19:51.510 --> 05:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
fortunately we have Mr Powers here to
 
05:19:54.150 --> 05:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
explain it I I do Health Care finance
 
05:19:56.708 --> 05:19:56.718 align:start position:0%
and it I have no clue about this
 
05:19:58.628 --> 05:19:58.638 align:start position:0%
education stuff this is this is the
 
05:20:02.470 --> 05:20:02.480 align:start position:0%
Smart committee here okay thank you
 
05:20:05.470 --> 05:20:05.480 align:start position:0%
yeah Corell thank you for taking my
 
05:20:07.590 --> 05:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
question I I'm confused about what you
 
05:20:09.070 --> 05:20:09.080 align:start position:0%
said did you say that if they could work
 
05:20:10.670 --> 05:20:10.680 align:start position:0%
it out themselves you don't care if this
 
05:20:13.390 --> 05:20:13.400 align:start position:0%
gets passed I I think uh at this moment
 
05:20:16.150 --> 05:20:16.160 align:start position:0%
it's it's your bill it's in my opinion
 
05:20:18.548 --> 05:20:18.558 align:start position:0%
no longer matters I I'm just trying to
 
05:20:22.070 --> 05:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
give you the context um and I I happen
 
05:20:24.510 --> 05:20:24.520 align:start position:0%
to be a believer that uh better
 
05:20:27.670 --> 05:20:27.680 align:start position:0%
government relies on fewer laws and and
 
05:20:29.788 --> 05:20:29.798 align:start position:0%
that we have more voluntary compliance
 
05:20:32.150 --> 05:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
and people just get along and they seem
 
05:20:34.430 --> 05:20:34.440 align:start position:0%
to be on the cusp of maybe being able to
 
05:20:37.110 --> 05:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
get along uh that's that's that's my
 
05:20:38.990 --> 05:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
observation they're going to come up
 
05:20:41.390 --> 05:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
here and maybe get into a fist fight I
 
05:20:41.400 --> 05:20:43.430 align:start position:0%
here and maybe get into a fist fight I
don't

05:20:43.430 --> 05:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
don't
 
05:20:46.788 --> 05:20:46.798 align:start position:0%
know repr s thank you I promise my
 
05:20:48.470 --> 05:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
question is easy I'm just curious how
 
05:20:51.948 --> 05:20:51.958 align:start position:0%
many um publicy we have in New Hampshire
 
05:20:53.830 --> 05:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
I believe the answer is three but there
 
05:20:55.708 --> 05:20:55.718 align:start position:0%
are probably 12 people here who can
 
05:20:55.718 --> 05:20:58.230 align:start position:0%
are probably 12 people here who can
correct

05:20:58.230 --> 05:20:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:01.230 --> 05:21:01.240 align:start position:0%
me three just
 
05:21:03.750 --> 05:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
two I I I don't know I thought it was
 
05:21:06.150 --> 05:21:06.160 align:start position:0%
three I know Pinkerton is one of them
 
05:21:11.350 --> 05:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:13.990 --> 05:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
F the questions for representative
 
05:21:16.350 --> 05:21:16.360 align:start position:0%
Edwards uh seeing none no one watch The
 
05:21:18.150 --> 05:21:18.160 align:start position:0%
Challenge you any further so thank you
 
05:21:20.788 --> 05:21:20.798 align:start position:0%
very much uh for being here all right uh
 
05:21:28.190 --> 05:21:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:43.190 --> 05:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:45.230 --> 05:21:45.240 align:start position:0%
is that on or off
 
05:21:47.510 --> 05:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
sorry good afternoon everyone thank you
 
05:21:50.350 --> 05:21:50.360 align:start position:0%
for uh uh hosting a wonderful event here
 
05:21:53.708 --> 05:21:53.718 align:start position:0%
today um I I do want to say my name is
 
05:21:55.750 --> 05:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
Alan Lov I'm been the uh on the Auburn
 
05:21:59.030 --> 05:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
school board for 18 years uh sort of a
 
05:22:00.628 --> 05:22:00.638 align:start position:0%
brief period of time depending on how
 
05:22:04.548 --> 05:22:04.558 align:start position:0%
old you are uh I I'm a little bit taken
 
05:22:08.350 --> 05:22:08.360 align:start position:0%
aback by some of uh uh Jess's comments
 
05:22:08.360 --> 05:22:09.230 align:start position:0%
aback by some of uh uh Jess's comments
uh

05:22:09.230 --> 05:22:09.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:22:10.510 --> 05:22:10.520 align:start position:0%
uh Dr poers and I did have a
 
05:22:13.350 --> 05:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
conversation yesterday morning but uh I
 
05:22:15.150 --> 05:22:15.160 align:start position:0%
never had a conversation with Jess and
 
05:22:17.948 --> 05:22:17.958 align:start position:0%
and my conversations with Tim did not
 
05:22:21.708 --> 05:22:21.718 align:start position:0%
end in a amicable solution to this uh
 
05:22:24.628 --> 05:22:24.638 align:start position:0%
this is a is a big problem for for our
 
05:22:26.230 --> 05:22:26.240 align:start position:0%
community and and you'll hear from
 
05:22:30.628 --> 05:22:30.638 align:start position:0%
someone else that uh we're seeking to to
 
05:22:33.750 --> 05:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
a a clear playing field for everyone
 
05:22:37.788 --> 05:22:37.798 align:start position:0%
right so there's two semi-public uh high
 
05:22:39.590 --> 05:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
schools right semi-private but they're
 
05:22:42.150 --> 05:22:42.160 align:start position:0%
that means they're semi-public um that
 
05:22:44.910 --> 05:22:44.920 align:start position:0%
do not report where the tax dollars go
 
05:22:47.750 --> 05:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
to anyone so we have stuff in our
 
05:22:50.270 --> 05:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
contracts each town has almost the exact
 
05:22:52.430 --> 05:22:52.440 align:start position:0%
same contract with Pinkerton when we
 
05:22:55.868 --> 05:22:55.878 align:start position:0%
first went to Pinkerton we we were
 
05:22:57.708 --> 05:22:57.718 align:start position:0%
desperate for a change we our school was
 
05:22:59.590 --> 05:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
attending Manchester schools in the
 
05:23:02.788 --> 05:23:02.798 align:start position:0%
early 2000s after being uh kicked out of
 
05:23:05.350 --> 05:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
Pinkerton we had to go to Manchester
 
05:23:07.350 --> 05:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
we Auburn's had students going to
 
05:23:09.788 --> 05:23:09.798 align:start position:0%
Pinkerton since 18 18 I believe is the
 
05:23:11.708 --> 05:23:11.718 align:start position:0%
earliest date so there's always been a
 
05:23:13.948 --> 05:23:13.958 align:start position:0%
relationship but through growth factors
 
05:23:15.788 --> 05:23:15.798 align:start position:0%
and whatnot pron asked us to not come
 
05:23:17.628 --> 05:23:17.638 align:start position:0%
back so we end up in a contract with
 
05:23:20.548 --> 05:23:20.558 align:start position:0%
Manchester for several years Manchester
 
05:23:24.030 --> 05:23:24.040 align:start position:0%
schools are sometimes difficult they
 
05:23:26.590 --> 05:23:26.600 align:start position:0%
were always suffering from budget issues
 
05:23:28.510 --> 05:23:28.520 align:start position:0%
without control by essentially the
 
05:23:30.110 --> 05:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
school board you you're you're all
 
05:23:32.070 --> 05:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
probably well aware of that so we were
 
05:23:34.150 --> 05:23:34.160 align:start position:0%
able to uh look for a new high school we
 
05:23:36.470 --> 05:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
tried to build one do other things but
 
05:23:38.548 --> 05:23:38.558 align:start position:0%
in the end result we we went to pin and
 
05:23:41.270 --> 05:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
they agreed to take us back and uh we
 
05:23:42.788 --> 05:23:42.798 align:start position:0%
signed our first contract with them but
 
05:23:44.948 --> 05:23:44.958 align:start position:0%
the contract that we signed was we were
 
05:23:46.708 --> 05:23:46.718 align:start position:0%
hand given a contract that every other
 
05:23:49.110 --> 05:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
sending town has and it was essentially
 
05:23:50.270 --> 05:23:50.280 align:start position:0%
take it or leave
 
05:23:52.750 --> 05:23:52.760 align:start position:0%
it well we took it within our contract
 
05:23:54.670 --> 05:23:54.680 align:start position:0%
is a a phase that every five years you
 
05:23:57.470 --> 05:23:57.480 align:start position:0%
can negotiate uh with each other to to
 
05:23:59.868 --> 05:23:59.878 align:start position:0%
change the contract um we happen to
 
05:24:02.830 --> 05:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
actually negotiate this past year um we
 
05:24:07.150 --> 05:24:07.160 align:start position:0%
offered perhaps 10 items um uh and we
 
05:24:09.310 --> 05:24:09.320 align:start position:0%
were told no to every single item
 
05:24:13.150 --> 05:24:13.160 align:start position:0%
including minor word changes so that
 
05:24:16.390 --> 05:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
that brings us to this um despite the
 
05:24:18.030 --> 05:24:18.040 align:start position:0%
thought that they're going to provide us
 
05:24:20.470 --> 05:24:20.480 align:start position:0%
certain information that they do not
 
05:24:22.670 --> 05:24:22.680 align:start position:0%
they they provide it their way not the
 
05:24:24.470 --> 05:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
same way that every other high school in
 
05:24:26.708 --> 05:24:26.718 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire provides and
 
05:24:29.430 --> 05:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
coincidentally every Charter School
 
05:24:32.430 --> 05:24:32.440 align:start position:0%
don't forget you you could you should
 
05:24:33.948 --> 05:24:33.958 align:start position:0%
lump Pinkerton in as a charter school
 
05:24:35.350 --> 05:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
because they are you know charter
 
05:24:37.590 --> 05:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
schools are private Pinkerton is private
 
05:24:39.110 --> 05:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
so it's much easier have the analogy
 
05:24:40.910 --> 05:24:40.920 align:start position:0%
that they're up Charter School in terms
 
05:24:43.788 --> 05:24:43.798 align:start position:0%
of how the documents for the state would
 
05:24:46.390 --> 05:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
work i' I've talked to the people at the
 
05:24:48.350 --> 05:24:48.360 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and and that's
 
05:24:50.548 --> 05:24:50.558 align:start position:0%
how they would use that information is
 
05:24:52.310 --> 05:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
they would more closely align them to a
 
05:24:55.430 --> 05:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
charter school because they don't uh
 
05:24:57.270 --> 05:24:57.280 align:start position:0%
they don't go back it's the form that
 
05:24:59.948 --> 05:24:59.958 align:start position:0%
we're looking for is about taxes and
 
05:25:02.150 --> 05:25:02.160 align:start position:0%
obviously uh that doesn't apply in the
 
05:25:04.868 --> 05:25:04.878 align:start position:0%
same manner there
 
05:25:07.670 --> 05:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
so we I also happen to sit on a budget
 
05:25:09.190 --> 05:25:09.200 align:start position:0%
committee that's always always a great
 
05:25:12.110 --> 05:25:12.120 align:start position:0%
time too uh when the budget committee
 
05:25:15.030 --> 05:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
asks what are what's going on I can't
 
05:25:17.230 --> 05:25:17.240 align:start position:0%
answer them we can't tell them where our
 
05:25:20.150 --> 05:25:20.160 align:start position:0%
money goes at Pinkerton Academy it's not
 
05:25:22.110 --> 05:25:22.120 align:start position:0%
you know it's not available to us to be
 
05:25:26.070 --> 05:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
shared sometimes I believe uh Dr power
 
05:25:27.070 --> 05:25:27.080 align:start position:0%
shared a document with our
 
05:25:29.390 --> 05:25:29.400 align:start position:0%
superintendent this past January but
 
05:25:30.868 --> 05:25:30.878 align:start position:0%
it's very general in terms and it
 
05:25:34.390 --> 05:25:34.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't explain where all of our tax
 
05:25:35.948 --> 05:25:35.958 align:start position:0%
dollars so we're talking local tax
 
05:25:37.830 --> 05:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
dollars state tax dollars and federal
 
05:25:38.910 --> 05:25:38.920 align:start position:0%
tax dollars
 
05:25:40.350 --> 05:25:40.360 align:start position:0%
it doesn't explain where they go what
 
05:25:42.670 --> 05:25:42.680 align:start position:0%
portion they go where and what happens
 
05:25:44.270 --> 05:25:44.280 align:start position:0%
we're not interested in pinker's
 
05:25:45.830 --> 05:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
finances in terms of how much money they
 
05:25:47.590 --> 05:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
have or all the other things many
 
05:25:48.948 --> 05:25:48.958 align:start position:0%
charter schools have separate
 
05:25:51.350 --> 05:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
foundations that hold all of their
 
05:25:53.948 --> 05:25:53.958 align:start position:0%
finances but they still report they
 
05:25:56.270 --> 05:25:56.280 align:start position:0%
still file this report one of the things
 
05:25:58.948 --> 05:25:58.958 align:start position:0%
that's very uh interesting in that on
 
05:26:01.670 --> 05:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
the end of this form I think it's an
 
05:26:04.830 --> 05:26:04.840 align:start position:0%
ms27 maybe at 25 I apologize for not
 
05:26:06.470 --> 05:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
having that right in front of me but
 
05:26:08.350 --> 05:26:08.360 align:start position:0%
that document at the end actually
 
05:26:10.990 --> 05:26:11.000 align:start position:0%
calculates how much it costs per pupil
 
05:26:13.590 --> 05:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
to be educated it's an incredibly
 
05:26:16.510 --> 05:26:16.520 align:start position:0%
valuable tool across the entire Spectrum
 
05:26:16.520 --> 05:26:18.030 align:start position:0%
valuable tool across the entire Spectrum
right

05:26:18.030 --> 05:26:18.040 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:26:23.230 --> 05:26:23.240 align:start position:0%
so I think it's it's time for pink to be
 
05:26:25.590 --> 05:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
brought forward to do the same things
 
05:26:27.750 --> 05:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
that everyone else does it it's it's
 
05:26:29.548 --> 05:26:29.558 align:start position:0%
just that simple it's not a giant thing
 
05:26:31.708 --> 05:26:31.718 align:start position:0%
that they have to you know they'd have
 
05:26:34.390 --> 05:26:34.400 align:start position:0%
to they certainly work in setting up the
 
05:26:36.708 --> 05:26:36.718 align:start position:0%
forms or the format of how the
 
05:26:38.310 --> 05:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
information is presented but they have
 
05:26:40.670 --> 05:26:40.680 align:start position:0%
all the information it's I'm sure they I
 
05:26:42.868 --> 05:26:42.878 align:start position:0%
know let me rephrase I know they have
 
05:26:44.590 --> 05:26:44.600 align:start position:0%
smart people that work there all right
 
05:26:47.150 --> 05:26:47.160 align:start position:0%
they have very a lot of good people with
 
05:26:51.350 --> 05:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
within that staff to pull this off so
 
05:26:54.628 --> 05:26:54.638 align:start position:0%
that's my my beginning
 
05:26:57.948 --> 05:26:57.958 align:start position:0%
no um in the state law and I was trying
 
05:26:59.948 --> 05:26:59.958 align:start position:0%
to find it I and I'm not a whiz at it
 
05:27:02.708 --> 05:27:02.718 align:start position:0%
but in section 198 it talks about this
 
05:27:04.830 --> 05:27:04.840 align:start position:0%
reporting structure the next section
 
05:27:06.390 --> 05:27:06.400 align:start position:0%
after that that calls out the remedies
 
05:27:09.150 --> 05:27:09.160 align:start position:0%
if you don't do it actually has publicy
 
05:27:13.270 --> 05:27:13.280 align:start position:0%
listed already so I don't know when I
 
05:27:14.830 --> 05:27:14.840 align:start position:0%
don't know how but sometime it must have
 
05:27:16.830 --> 05:27:16.840 align:start position:0%
been pulled out but the the remedy
 
05:27:19.670 --> 05:27:19.680 align:start position:0%
section of the law already has publicy
 
05:27:22.590 --> 05:27:22.600 align:start position:0%
listed so that's why you know we we
 
05:27:23.750 --> 05:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
looked at some things and and this
 
05:27:26.230 --> 05:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
seemed like an easy place to make an
 
05:27:28.708 --> 05:27:28.718 align:start position:0%
accommodation was to just put this back
 
05:27:35.430 --> 05:27:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:38.708 --> 05:27:38.718 align:start position:0%
Schools this is about fairness equity
 
05:27:42.230 --> 05:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
and accountability I I'm as an education
 
05:27:43.750 --> 05:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
committee you guys are gonna have your
 
05:27:46.830 --> 05:27:46.840 align:start position:0%
hands full all year I'm sure this is a
 
05:27:48.390 --> 05:27:48.400 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of things happening out
 
05:27:52.230 --> 05:27:52.240 align:start position:0%
there in the education field um and for
 
05:27:56.910 --> 05:27:56.920 align:start position:0%
us this is about again just we spend one
 
05:27:59.948 --> 05:27:59.958 align:start position:0%
almost one fifth of our budget is just
 
05:28:01.470 --> 05:28:01.480 align:start position:0%
out the door we don't have any say on
 
05:28:04.110 --> 05:28:04.120 align:start position:0%
what's going on with that money so we
 
05:28:06.948 --> 05:28:06.958 align:start position:0%
have a $16 million budget or so $4
 
05:28:10.230 --> 05:28:10.240 align:start position:0%
million um I'm sorry we have $18 million
 
05:28:12.310 --> 05:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
budget and almost $4 million goes
 
05:28:14.430 --> 05:28:14.440 align:start position:0%
straight to Pinkerton with no
 
05:28:17.750 --> 05:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
accountability for what it is and um I
 
05:28:20.590 --> 05:28:20.600 align:start position:0%
don't think that that's fair to any of
 
05:28:22.590 --> 05:28:22.600 align:start position:0%
the Auburn taxpayers certainly I don't
 
05:28:23.750 --> 05:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
think it's fair to the people around
 
05:28:25.030 --> 05:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
there I I don't think it's actually fair
 
05:28:27.470 --> 05:28:27.480 align:start position:0%
to Pinker and that they could be looking
 
05:28:29.548 --> 05:28:29.558 align:start position:0%
really good by the same paper by saying
 
05:28:31.750 --> 05:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
hey it only cost 13 Grand to educate
 
05:28:34.510 --> 05:28:34.520 align:start position:0%
your child here versus 18,000 at these
 
05:28:37.230 --> 05:28:37.240 align:start position:0%
other places right but how they come up
 
05:28:38.708 --> 05:28:38.718 align:start position:0%
with their calcul
 
05:28:40.948 --> 05:28:40.958 align:start position:0%
isn't the same as what every other
 
05:28:42.948 --> 05:28:42.958 align:start position:0%
institution except Co Brown does in the
 
05:28:47.030 --> 05:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire so I uh again I I
 
05:28:48.708 --> 05:28:48.718 align:start position:0%
I didn't have a conversation with Jess
 
05:28:52.110 --> 05:28:52.120 align:start position:0%
about my conversation with Tim um so I
 
05:28:54.270 --> 05:28:54.280 align:start position:0%
I'm we are by no means
 
05:28:56.830 --> 05:28:56.840 align:start position:0%
satisfied that yeah we'll we'll provide
 
05:28:58.548 --> 05:28:58.558 align:start position:0%
it to you I I don't want to get into the
 
05:29:01.230 --> 05:29:01.240 align:start position:0%
issues that are not part of this bill
 
05:29:05.350 --> 05:29:05.360 align:start position:0%
but I promise you I have zero belief
 
05:29:06.830 --> 05:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
that the town of Auburn is going to be
 
05:29:09.830 --> 05:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
satisfied by them promising to do
 
05:29:12.310 --> 05:29:12.320 align:start position:0%
something we need to change in this law
 
05:29:14.350 --> 05:29:14.360 align:start position:0%
so that we can just see where our money
 
05:29:17.270 --> 05:29:17.280 align:start position:0%
goes and how they're accountable to us
 
05:29:20.310 --> 05:29:20.320 align:start position:0%
as the people who are employing their
 
05:29:20.320 --> 05:29:21.830 align:start position:0%
as the people who are employing their
institution

05:29:21.830 --> 05:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
institution
 
05:29:26.110 --> 05:29:26.120 align:start position:0%
so I would I really do seek your your
 
05:29:28.628 --> 05:29:28.638 align:start position:0%
help and approval for this so if you
 
05:29:30.910 --> 05:29:30.920 align:start position:0%
have any questions I'm happy to try and
 
05:29:32.708 --> 05:29:32.718 align:start position:0%

just as I make my notes sure this is on
 
05:29:50.788 --> 05:29:50.798 align:start position:0%
behalf of the Auburn school board thank
 
05:29:56.030 --> 05:29:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:59.470 --> 05:29:59.480 align:start position:0%
this how many students do you
 
05:30:03.708 --> 05:30:03.718 align:start position:0%
have uh roughly speaking we have 300
 
05:30:05.430 --> 05:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
students it
 
05:30:07.830 --> 05:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
varies uh as you all know special ed is
 
05:30:12.788 --> 05:30:12.798 align:start position:0%

05:30:15.680 --> 05:30:17.868 align:start position:0%
endeavor provides interesting things all
the

05:30:17.868 --> 05:30:17.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:20.990 --> 05:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
time um any further
 
05:30:23.510 --> 05:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
questions um yes representative
 
05:30:26.310 --> 05:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
hul question I'll ask the question again
 
05:30:28.030 --> 05:30:28.040 align:start position:0%
I think you might have answered it it an
 
05:30:29.830 --> 05:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
academy what makes a school in Academy
 
05:30:30.990 --> 05:30:31.000 align:start position:0%
that they're semi-private and
 
05:30:33.390 --> 05:30:33.400 align:start position:0%
semi-public what makes a school in
 
05:30:35.590 --> 05:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
Academy it's how they were created long
 
05:30:38.030 --> 05:30:38.040 align:start position:0%
ago before the rules even came in Pinker
 
05:30:40.030 --> 05:30:40.040 align:start position:0%
Academy has been around since the early
 
05:30:41.910 --> 05:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
1800s before there was such a thing as
 
05:30:45.708 --> 05:30:45.718 align:start position:0%
high school um so there are two Co Brown
 
05:30:50.110 --> 05:30:50.120 align:start position:0%
and Pinkerton are are in order I believe
 
05:30:51.390 --> 05:30:51.400 align:start position:0%
you're legislator so you might know
 
05:30:54.190 --> 05:30:54.200 align:start position:0%
better than I do but they have to be
 
05:30:57.350 --> 05:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
semiu in order to receive State dollars
 
05:30:59.150 --> 05:30:59.160 align:start position:0%
because you don't I doubt we fund
 
05:31:01.708 --> 05:31:01.718 align:start position:0%
anybody no private schools here right
 
05:31:04.750 --> 05:31:04.760 align:start position:0%
except through another Avenue that I
 
05:31:08.390 --> 05:31:08.400 align:start position:0%
won't say um so they they in order to do
 
05:31:10.708 --> 05:31:10.718 align:start position:0%
that and in fact so pingon does a really
 
05:31:12.750 --> 05:31:12.760 align:start position:0%
good job of a lot of things I'm not
 
05:31:14.830 --> 05:31:14.840 align:start position:0%
trying to rail against their teachers
 
05:31:17.510 --> 05:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
anything about that but our I'll say our
 
05:31:19.430 --> 05:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
contract isn't good we can't do anything
 
05:31:21.230 --> 05:31:21.240 align:start position:0%
about it it's a 20-year contract
 
05:31:23.868 --> 05:31:23.878 align:start position:0%
renewable every five years I'm sure
 
05:31:26.868 --> 05:31:26.878 align:start position:0%
you're aware that it's difficult to
 
05:31:29.350 --> 05:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
solve a high school problem in in wide
 
05:31:32.270 --> 05:31:32.280 align:start position:0%
ranging communities there's
 
05:31:34.150 --> 05:31:34.160 align:start position:0%
uh I I don't want to make this a
 
05:31:35.470 --> 05:31:35.480 align:start position:0%
contract thing because it's not it's
 
05:31:37.990 --> 05:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
it's really about reporting and the
 
05:31:40.548 --> 05:31:40.558 align:start position:0%
fairness of tax dollars that are not
 
05:31:41.948 --> 05:31:41.958 align:start position:0%
being able to be reported to budget
 
05:31:43.868 --> 05:31:43.878 align:start position:0%
committees and other people and and
 
05:31:45.910 --> 05:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
local towns people who were paying the
 
05:31:49.110 --> 05:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
bill so thank you all right sorry I
 
05:31:50.948 --> 05:31:50.958 align:start position:0%
might ramble a
 
05:31:54.110 --> 05:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
bit represent Terry yes thank so if I
 
05:31:55.590 --> 05:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
recall you say you've been on the school
 
05:31:59.350 --> 05:31:59.360 align:start position:0%
board for 18 years 18 years okay this
 
05:32:03.030 --> 05:32:03.040 align:start position:0%
contract is for 20 years yeah it's a yes
 
05:32:04.990 --> 05:32:05.000 align:start position:0%
the contract were you a member of the
 
05:32:06.868 --> 05:32:06.878 align:start position:0%
board at the time that the contract was
 
05:32:10.470 --> 05:32:10.480 align:start position:0%
negotiated and and would I surmise then
 
05:32:12.868 --> 05:32:12.878 align:start position:0%
you didn't really know at the time what
 
05:32:14.948 --> 05:32:14.958 align:start position:0%
was going to happen because you're not
 
05:32:17.830 --> 05:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
happy it so when you when you receive
 
05:32:19.910 --> 05:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
this contract we were very happy in the
 
05:32:21.628 --> 05:32:21.638 align:start position:0%
in the first year we received this and
 
05:32:23.548 --> 05:32:23.558 align:start position:0%
this about contract now right so it's a
 
05:32:24.910 --> 05:32:24.920 align:start position:0%
little bit different than the bill but
 
05:32:27.708 --> 05:32:27.718 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to share we signed we we
 
05:32:29.670 --> 05:32:29.680 align:start position:0%
needed to a place to go they were going
 
05:32:30.708 --> 05:32:30.718 align:start position:0%
to take us they were going to give us a
 
05:32:31.990 --> 05:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
20-year contract that's not what
 
05:32:33.750 --> 05:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
Manchester was doing for us so as a
 
05:32:35.788 --> 05:32:35.798 align:start position:0%
community we need to solve a problem and
 
05:32:38.510 --> 05:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
pinkan helped us solve a problem
 
05:32:39.948 --> 05:32:39.958 align:start position:0%
when it when we were negotiating the
 
05:32:41.990 --> 05:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
contract essentially they gave us the
 
05:32:43.948 --> 05:32:43.958 align:start position:0%
contract that they gave to Derry to
 
05:32:48.788 --> 05:32:48.798 align:start position:0%
Chester to at the time uh Windom perhaps
 
05:32:51.868 --> 05:32:51.878 align:start position:0%
I can't remember Windom Hamstead so that
 
05:32:53.788 --> 05:32:53.798 align:start position:0%
was the contract the basic contract that
 
05:32:56.150 --> 05:32:56.160 align:start position:0%
we had to sign up for it's a take it or
 
05:32:57.070 --> 05:32:57.080 align:start position:0%
leave it
 
05:32:59.628 --> 05:32:59.638 align:start position:0%
scenario within that contract it says we
 
05:33:02.030 --> 05:33:02.040 align:start position:0%
can negotiate every five years
 
05:33:06.190 --> 05:33:06.200 align:start position:0%
renegotiate terms well we've tried to do
 
05:33:09.750 --> 05:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
that um there's no again we're in the
 
05:33:11.230 --> 05:33:11.240 align:start position:0%
contract there's no remedy in the
 
05:33:12.510 --> 05:33:12.520 align:start position:0%
contract for
 
05:33:14.708 --> 05:33:14.718 align:start position:0%
anything if they're in breach there's no
 
05:33:16.830 --> 05:33:16.840 align:start position:0%
there's no answer to it the contract is
 
05:33:19.670 --> 05:33:19.680 align:start position:0%
is not a well done document but it's not
 
05:33:21.590 --> 05:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
something that we can ask the state to
 
05:33:25.150 --> 05:33:25.160 align:start position:0%
do all we can ask is for uh we we signed
 
05:33:28.628 --> 05:33:28.638 align:start position:0%
it uh and had expectations and those
 
05:33:30.270 --> 05:33:30.280 align:start position:0%
expectations I guess you would say are
 
05:33:32.788 --> 05:33:32.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:35.628 --> 05:33:35.638 align:start position:0%
fulfilled follow when did you sign the
 
05:33:39.628 --> 05:33:39.638 align:start position:0%
contract so I can know how long probably
 
05:33:43.510 --> 05:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
201 12 so you're 12 years into this with
 
05:33:45.948 --> 05:33:45.958 align:start position:0%
eight more years to go oh no no no every
 
05:33:48.910 --> 05:33:48.920 align:start position:0%
year it's a 20-year contract renewable
 
05:33:51.230 --> 05:33:51.240 align:start position:0%
every five years automatically yes
 
05:33:53.310 --> 05:33:53.320 align:start position:0%
automatically unless we we have to give
 
05:33:54.590 --> 05:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
notice we have to give at least a
 
05:33:59.110 --> 05:33:59.120 align:start position:0%
15-year notice to get out okay so it's
 
05:34:01.350 --> 05:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
uh okay 15 years is a good long time
 
05:34:03.510 --> 05:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
right um maybe you could build another
 
05:34:06.470 --> 05:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
High School in 15 years however it's not
 
05:34:10.390 --> 05:34:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:14.750 --> 05:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:17.150 --> 05:34:17.160 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
05:34:19.670 --> 05:34:19.680 align:start position:0%

specifics just to clarify a couple of
 
05:35:01.030 --> 05:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
things that were just brought up um with
 
05:35:02.910 --> 05:35:02.920 align:start position:0%
regard to state tax dollars the
 
05:35:06.390 --> 05:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
education um Aid that is uh per pupil
 
05:35:08.190 --> 05:35:08.200 align:start position:0%

05:35:20.270 --> 05:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
dollars that we do get go through a
 
05:35:23.110 --> 05:35:23.120 align:start position:0%
Consortium um through our our CTE
 
05:35:24.788 --> 05:35:24.798 align:start position:0%
portion like that but the the State
 
05:35:27.948 --> 05:35:27.958 align:start position:0%
education the individual um per pupil
 
05:35:29.788 --> 05:35:29.798 align:start position:0%
money goes to the school districts not
 
05:35:33.750 --> 05:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
to us um and then with the the contract
 
05:35:36.310 --> 05:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
U piece there we do um it is a rolling
 
05:35:38.070 --> 05:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
um contract every every 5 years they
 
05:35:39.948 --> 05:35:39.958 align:start position:0%
have the ability to and the last time
 
05:35:41.350 --> 05:35:41.360 align:start position:0%
with auburn there were some changes that
 
05:35:43.350 --> 05:35:43.360 align:start position:0%
we did agree to and and shared back with
 
05:35:46.510 --> 05:35:46.520 align:start position:0%
them but uh they did not uh respond or
 
05:35:48.990 --> 05:35:49.000 align:start position:0%
agree to those changes but what I'm here
 
05:35:50.590 --> 05:35:50.600 align:start position:0%
for is is really about what it is that
 
05:35:52.548 --> 05:35:52.558 align:start position:0%
we provide um we are ping Academy is an
 
05:35:54.990 --> 05:35:55.000 align:start position:0%
independent school um we were founded in
 
05:35:58.070 --> 05:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
1814 uh we have six towns currently that
 
05:36:00.868 --> 05:36:00.878 align:start position:0%
we educate uh students that reside in
 
05:36:02.430 --> 05:36:02.440 align:start position:0%
those towns um because we have contracts
 
05:36:04.590 --> 05:36:04.600 align:start position:0%
with those school boards to provide the
 
05:36:06.310 --> 05:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
high school services for students that
 
05:36:09.350 --> 05:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
reside in the community um what makes us
 
05:36:11.948 --> 05:36:11.958 align:start position:0%
an AC a public Academy um in this sense
 
05:36:13.868 --> 05:36:13.878 align:start position:0%
is we are an independent school um so we
 
05:36:15.628 --> 05:36:15.638 align:start position:0%
are a private organization we're
 
05:36:17.788 --> 05:36:17.798 align:start position:0%
nonprofit organization but with those
 
05:36:21.030 --> 05:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
contracts to the school boards any
 
05:36:22.548 --> 05:36:22.558 align:start position:0%

program so we have a regular red and
 
05:38:04.110 --> 05:38:04.120 align:start position:0%
then we also break it down by our
 
05:38:06.070 --> 05:38:06.080 align:start position:0%

based on the various needs that the
 
05:38:17.030 --> 05:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
students have
 
05:38:20.070 --> 05:38:20.080 align:start position:0%
um along with that we also um when we go
 
05:38:22.350 --> 05:38:22.360 align:start position:0%
through our budget cycle um our Board of
 
05:38:24.430 --> 05:38:24.440 align:start position:0%
my Board of Trustees uh approves the
 
05:38:27.548 --> 05:38:27.558 align:start position:0%
budget in November and once that's
 
05:38:29.190 --> 05:38:29.200 align:start position:0%
approved um I meet with the sending Town
 
05:38:30.868 --> 05:38:30.878 align:start position:0%
superintendent I give them a budget memo
 
05:38:32.868 --> 05:38:32.878 align:start position:0%
that outlines the budget for the next
 
05:38:35.390 --> 05:38:35.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal year so uh this past December is
 
05:38:36.590 --> 05:38:36.600 align:start position:0%
when I met with them and had a budget
 
05:38:38.390 --> 05:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
memo that high highlighted what the what
 
05:38:40.510 --> 05:38:40.520 align:start position:0%
the tuition rate was going to be for the
 
05:38:43.110 --> 05:38:43.120 align:start position:0%
upcoming year what were the drivers um
 
05:38:45.708 --> 05:38:45.718 align:start position:0%
if we had an increase um uh many times
 
05:38:47.430 --> 05:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
you the world we live in right now with
 
05:38:49.628 --> 05:38:49.638 align:start position:0%
the with inflation and things like that
 
05:38:50.708 --> 05:38:50.718 align:start position:0%
prices have gone up so we've had
 
05:38:52.910 --> 05:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
increases we have had some decreases in
 
05:38:54.868 --> 05:38:54.878 align:start position:0%
some of the tuition rates on our program
 
05:38:56.750 --> 05:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
um based on uh the number of students
 
05:38:58.350 --> 05:38:58.360 align:start position:0%
that are in the program what it cost to
 
05:39:00.830 --> 05:39:00.840 align:start position:0%
operate each of the programs uh but in
 
05:39:02.670 --> 05:39:02.680 align:start position:0%
that memo it it highlights what are
 
05:39:04.510 --> 05:39:04.520 align:start position:0%
those drivers what are what are the
 
05:39:06.230 --> 05:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
things that are causing our tuition to
 
05:39:09.548 --> 05:39:09.558 align:start position:0%
to increase decrease um and such there
 
05:39:11.150 --> 05:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
we really work to try and communicate
 
05:39:13.190 --> 05:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
with our sending towns about our tuition
 
05:39:15.590 --> 05:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
leading up to it so by contract we have
 
05:39:17.830 --> 05:39:17.840 align:start position:0%
three meetings per year with our sending
 
05:39:19.390 --> 05:39:19.400 align:start position:0%
Town School boards uh that meet with the
 
05:39:20.990 --> 05:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
Board of Trustees where we have
 
05:39:22.750 --> 05:39:22.760 align:start position:0%
information that we share with them
 
05:39:24.150 --> 05:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
they're able to ask questions and go
 
05:39:26.190 --> 05:39:26.200 align:start position:0%
through it and generally in October we
 
05:39:28.230 --> 05:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
give them a a ballpark of where we're at
 
05:39:29.548 --> 05:39:29.558 align:start position:0%
and what we're looking at for tuition
 
05:39:31.830 --> 05:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
the next uh upcoming year and what we've
 
05:39:33.350 --> 05:39:33.360 align:start position:0%
done the past couple of years is in the
 
05:39:35.190 --> 05:39:35.200 align:start position:0%
weeks leading after that um I've
 
05:39:37.030 --> 05:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
communicated to the superintendent Where
 
05:39:38.910 --> 05:39:38.920 align:start position:0%
We Are as we continue to refine our
 
05:39:41.390 --> 05:39:41.400 align:start position:0%
budget and get to that budget number so
 
05:39:43.310 --> 05:39:43.320 align:start position:0%
uh for this past year each week I would
 
05:39:45.110 --> 05:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
just share what the what the percent
 
05:39:46.830 --> 05:39:46.840 align:start position:0%
increase on regular education because
 
05:39:48.468 --> 05:39:48.478 align:start position:0%
that's the biggest chunk of of all of
 
05:39:50.670 --> 05:39:50.680 align:start position:0%
all their budgets where it stands and
 
05:39:53.868 --> 05:39:53.878 align:start position:0%
how it's been uh fine-tuned each week as
 
05:39:55.590 --> 05:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
we go through the budget process until
 
05:39:57.430 --> 05:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
we get to that final number when the
 
05:39:59.948 --> 05:39:59.958 align:start position:0%
board approves the budget in November um
 
05:40:01.468 --> 05:40:01.478 align:start position:0%
that that night that very next day I
 
05:40:03.150 --> 05:40:03.160 align:start position:0%
share with the sing towns this is what
 
05:40:05.030 --> 05:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
the tuition rates are um and then
 
05:40:06.708 --> 05:40:06.718 align:start position:0%
explain when we have the meeting I'll go
 
05:40:07.670 --> 05:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
through all that information information
 
05:40:10.868 --> 05:40:10.878 align:start position:0%
with them um we also do a couple of
 
05:40:12.910 --> 05:40:12.920 align:start position:0%
other pieces of things uh to share with
 
05:40:15.030 --> 05:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
our communities um we produce an annual
 
05:40:17.390 --> 05:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
report that kind of gives a a high level
 
05:40:18.948 --> 05:40:18.958 align:start position:0%
overview of things that occurred last
 
05:40:20.750 --> 05:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
year so there's a financial aspect of it
 
05:40:22.990 --> 05:40:23.000 align:start position:0%
where we touch on our our budget what it
 
05:40:25.468 --> 05:40:25.478 align:start position:0%
was what it provided but then we also
 
05:40:27.150 --> 05:40:27.160 align:start position:0%
highlight uh different accomplishments
 
05:40:29.270 --> 05:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
of students um this past year we've been
 
05:40:30.590 --> 05:40:30.600 align:start position:0%
in a building project so we share
 
05:40:33.390 --> 05:40:33.400 align:start position:0%
information about where that was um uh
 
05:40:35.150 --> 05:40:35.160 align:start position:0%
new programming that we may have or
 
05:40:36.628 --> 05:40:36.638 align:start position:0%
changes in programming things like that
 
05:40:38.670 --> 05:40:38.680 align:start position:0%
and we produce a copy that we share at
 
05:40:40.310 --> 05:40:40.320 align:start position:0%
the October meeting with all of our
 
05:40:42.350 --> 05:40:42.360 align:start position:0%
sending towns and we also have a version
 
05:40:45.948 --> 05:40:45.958 align:start position:0%
online um we also produce a uh two other
 
05:40:48.350 --> 05:40:48.360 align:start position:0%
two narratives that speak specifically
 
05:40:50.548 --> 05:40:50.558 align:start position:0%
about our budget one's a look ahead at
 
05:40:52.948 --> 05:40:52.958 align:start position:0%
what's coming and one's a look back the
 
05:40:55.150 --> 05:40:55.160 align:start position:0%
budget narrative is a look ahead um what
 
05:40:58.030 --> 05:40:58.040 align:start position:0%
the next budget is what drives the cost
 
05:41:01.270 --> 05:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
um our process and budget information um
 
05:41:03.670 --> 05:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
this we share I share in a a letter to
 
05:41:05.110 --> 05:41:05.120 align:start position:0%
our community that it's there it's on
 
05:41:07.468 --> 05:41:07.478 align:start position:0%
our website um share it with our our
 
05:41:09.390 --> 05:41:09.400 align:start position:0%
sending town uh superintend so that they
 
05:41:10.628 --> 05:41:10.638 align:start position:0%
have that information that they can
 
05:41:12.708 --> 05:41:12.718 align:start position:0%
share with their school boards uh so the
 
05:41:13.788 --> 05:41:13.798 align:start position:0%
information is out there we're not
 
05:41:16.030 --> 05:41:16.040 align:start position:0%
trying to hide anything um we we put all
 
05:41:17.230 --> 05:41:17.240 align:start position:0%
that information out there so that they
 
05:41:19.310 --> 05:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
can see these are the drivers um and
 
05:41:20.670 --> 05:41:20.680 align:start position:0%
they have the information when if they
 
05:41:23.390 --> 05:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
get asked about the cost of Pinker in or
 
05:41:25.390 --> 05:41:25.400 align:start position:0%
or what what uh what's going into that
 
05:41:27.468 --> 05:41:27.478 align:start position:0%
upcoming year the other piece we have is
 
05:41:29.310 --> 05:41:29.320 align:start position:0%
the treasures narrative which is a look
 
05:41:32.030 --> 05:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
back at the prior year um so at the
 
05:41:33.548 --> 05:41:33.558 align:start position:0%
after the year's done our financial
 
05:41:35.310 --> 05:41:35.320 align:start position:0%
audits are done we take a look back at
 
05:41:37.708 --> 05:41:37.718 align:start position:0%
what uh the previous fiscal year was
 
05:41:39.948 --> 05:41:39.958 align:start position:0%
what it held what was our actual
 
05:41:43.070 --> 05:41:43.080 align:start position:0%
expenses expenses um if we were able to
 
05:41:44.910 --> 05:41:44.920 align:start position:0%
if come in under budget if we were over
 
05:41:48.350 --> 05:41:48.360 align:start position:0%
budget in any any case um you know we we
 
05:41:49.708 --> 05:41:49.718 align:start position:0%
try to be as fiscally responsible as
 
05:41:51.230 --> 05:41:51.240 align:start position:0%
possible and we've been coming in under
 
05:41:52.990 --> 05:41:53.000 align:start position:0%
budget as close to the budget because we
 
05:41:55.150 --> 05:41:55.160 align:start position:0%
don't want to have a a big budget and
 
05:41:56.628 --> 05:41:56.638 align:start position:0%
then just come in under we want to make
 
05:41:57.990 --> 05:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
sure that we're being very accurate with
 
05:42:00.390 --> 05:42:00.400 align:start position:0%
it um so we also include the September
 
05:42:02.270 --> 05:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
30th financials in that narrative that
 
05:42:03.830 --> 05:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
we share with the towns there so when we
 
05:42:05.548 --> 05:42:05.558 align:start position:0%
post those documents on our website so
 
05:42:07.510 --> 05:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
they're there for the public to see um
 
05:42:09.830 --> 05:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
it's shared out electronically um for
 
05:42:12.070 --> 05:42:12.080 align:start position:0%
our communities but then also um shared
 
05:42:14.468 --> 05:42:14.478 align:start position:0%
there and it's in um the past I believe
 
05:42:16.150 --> 05:42:16.160 align:start position:0%
three years are still posted on our
 
05:42:17.590 --> 05:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
website so people could go back and look
 
05:42:20.750 --> 05:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
at it over time um as a nonprofit We
 
05:42:22.590 --> 05:42:22.600 align:start position:0%
also have IRS requirements we have to
 
05:42:24.910 --> 05:42:24.920 align:start position:0%
fill out we um we fill out the IRS form
 
05:42:28.390 --> 05:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
990 um which is is a publicly available
 
05:42:29.628 --> 05:42:29.638 align:start position:0%
document as well that if you go on to
 
05:42:31.548 --> 05:42:31.558 align:start position:0%
the IRS website you can search for that
 
05:42:34.708 --> 05:42:34.718 align:start position:0%
and um and find that information as well
 
05:42:36.390 --> 05:42:36.400 align:start position:0%
um so in looking at this bill and what
 
05:42:37.750 --> 05:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
it's proposing
 
05:42:40.150 --> 05:42:40.160 align:start position:0%
um looked at the the requirements of it
 
05:42:43.468 --> 05:42:43.478 align:start position:0%
and the information and from what what I
 
05:42:45.868 --> 05:42:45.878 align:start position:0%
can see and look at the request of the
 
05:42:47.750 --> 05:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
bill is information that we we are
 
05:42:49.150 --> 05:42:49.160 align:start position:0%
already currently providing to our
 
05:42:51.670 --> 05:42:51.680 align:start position:0%
sending towns um so we just look at it
 
05:42:54.310 --> 05:42:54.320 align:start position:0%
as from the standpoint of it's it's not
 
05:42:56.948 --> 05:42:56.958 align:start position:0%
necessary in the sense from information
 
05:42:59.310 --> 05:42:59.320 align:start position:0%
that is being asked for um I think Mr
 
05:43:01.270 --> 05:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
vill spoke to spoke about a couple
 
05:43:02.670 --> 05:43:02.680 align:start position:0%
things and we had a we had a long
 
05:43:05.708 --> 05:43:05.718 align:start position:0%
conversation yesterday and um may agree
 
05:43:07.190 --> 05:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
to disagree on certain things and I
 
05:43:08.910 --> 05:43:08.920 align:start position:0%
think this uh a place that we can move
 
05:43:10.270 --> 05:43:10.280 align:start position:0%
forward and to continue with with
 
05:43:11.990 --> 05:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
conversations because at the end of the
 
05:43:14.030 --> 05:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
day um we're very proud of the education
 
05:43:16.390 --> 05:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
that we provide uh for our for our
 
05:43:17.628 --> 05:43:17.638 align:start position:0%
students for our communities for our
 
05:43:20.390 --> 05:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
families and um at the at the low cost
 
05:43:22.270 --> 05:43:22.280 align:start position:0%
per pupil that we're able to do it um
 
05:43:23.990 --> 05:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
and we try to make sure that we're very
 
05:43:25.590 --> 05:43:25.600 align:start position:0%
efficient with everything and and share
 
05:43:28.868 --> 05:43:28.878 align:start position:0%
and answer um questions that our um
 
05:43:31.310 --> 05:43:31.320 align:start position:0%
communities have uh for us as they're
 
05:43:34.990 --> 05:43:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:36.708 --> 05:43:36.718 align:start position:0%
processes thank you very much for your
 
05:43:36.718 --> 05:43:38.030 align:start position:0%
processes thank you very much for your
testing

05:43:38.030 --> 05:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
testing
 
05:43:39.910 --> 05:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
yes representative M thank you Mr
 
05:43:42.548 --> 05:43:42.558 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you all for being here um
 
05:43:44.390 --> 05:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
you did mention that there are six town
 
05:43:46.390 --> 05:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
service by Pinkerton Academy does that
 
05:43:48.310 --> 05:43:48.320 align:start position:0%
include towns that may send their
 
05:43:50.948 --> 05:43:50.958 align:start position:0%
students there just for the CTE program
 
05:43:53.350 --> 05:43:53.360 align:start position:0%
no so we
 
05:43:56.628 --> 05:43:56.638 align:start position:0%
have uh so we have we're a regional CT
 
05:43:58.788 --> 05:43:58.798 align:start position:0%
Center so we have contracts with six um
 
05:43:59.788 --> 05:43:59.798 align:start position:0%
what we're adding a seventh town
 
05:44:02.750 --> 05:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
fremonts in 2026 so anyone that lives
 
05:44:04.990 --> 05:44:05.000 align:start position:0%
there can attend for the high school
 
05:44:07.548 --> 05:44:07.558 align:start position:0%
purposes but uh we are one of two CTE
 
05:44:09.830 --> 05:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
regions in region 17 us and Salem are
 
05:44:12.350 --> 05:44:12.360 align:start position:0%
the two so any high school student in
 
05:44:14.670 --> 05:44:14.680 align:start position:0%
that region which would be uh Windham
 
05:44:18.030 --> 05:44:18.040 align:start position:0%
pelum uh timberlan can also access the
 
05:44:20.750 --> 05:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
CTE centers um so the region is divided
 
05:44:24.150 --> 05:44:24.160 align:start position:0%
between the two centers so um primarily
 
05:44:26.310 --> 05:44:26.320 align:start position:0%
students from timberlan uh will come to
 
05:44:28.548 --> 05:44:28.558 align:start position:0%
us we have some pelum students and some
 
05:44:30.030 --> 05:44:30.040 align:start position:0%
wiam students based on the programs that
 
05:44:32.030 --> 05:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
we offer uh but those are students that
 
05:44:34.590 --> 05:44:34.600 align:start position:0%
will then come to us um for those
 
05:44:37.548 --> 05:44:37.558 align:start position:0%
specific classes okay thank you you're
 
05:44:41.110 --> 05:44:41.120 align:start position:0%
welome yes representative
 
05:44:43.628 --> 05:44:43.638 align:start position:0%
Morris hi thanks for taking my question
 
05:44:45.150 --> 05:44:45.160 align:start position:0%
um I just had one question on cost per
 
05:44:47.750 --> 05:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
pupil like what the average is uh this
 
05:44:49.990 --> 05:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
year our our regular education rate is
 
05:44:53.750 --> 05:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:56.868 --> 05:44:56.878 align:start position:0%
16,38 thank you you're
 
05:45:00.310 --> 05:45:00.320 align:start position:0%
welcome representative Hall thank you Mr
 
05:45:01.350 --> 05:45:01.360 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
05:45:03.910 --> 05:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
question could you identify at least one
 
05:45:06.390 --> 05:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
or more things that they information
 
05:45:07.788 --> 05:45:07.798 align:start position:0%
that they want
 
05:45:09.150 --> 05:45:09.160 align:start position:0%
that you're not giving them I mean it
 
05:45:10.910 --> 05:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
sounds like we heard this stuff that
 
05:45:12.390 --> 05:45:12.400 align:start position:0%
you're not giving them but your
 
05:45:14.350 --> 05:45:14.360 align:start position:0%
presentation just acted like you gave
 
05:45:16.230 --> 05:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
them everything yeah where's the
 
05:45:18.990 --> 05:45:19.000 align:start position:0%
disconnect um I I think part of what
 
05:45:21.150 --> 05:45:21.160 align:start position:0%
they and at least my understanding and I
 
05:45:22.670 --> 05:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
can certainly be corrected if I'm wrong
 
05:45:24.708 --> 05:45:24.718 align:start position:0%
with this is when we look at the tuition
 
05:45:27.350 --> 05:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
for the upcoming year or changes is like
 
05:45:29.948 --> 05:45:29.958 align:start position:0%
what is constituting the change so like
 
05:45:32.548 --> 05:45:32.558 align:start position:0%
what what are some of the drivers to uh
 
05:45:34.750 --> 05:45:34.760 align:start position:0%
the increase in tuition um our increase
 
05:45:36.310 --> 05:45:36.320 align:start position:0%
in budget we have you know having those
 
05:45:39.030 --> 05:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
conversations like when um yesterday Mr
 
05:45:40.468 --> 05:45:40.478 align:start position:0%
Villanova and I had a conversation asked
 
05:45:42.310 --> 05:45:42.320 align:start position:0%
about like flat budget and they said the
 
05:45:44.548 --> 05:45:44.558 align:start position:0%
current year we're in we're we're pretty
 
05:45:46.468 --> 05:45:46.478 align:start position:0%
much in a flat budget our operating
 
05:45:48.070 --> 05:45:48.080 align:start position:0%
budget for regular education from last
 
05:45:50.590 --> 05:45:50.600 align:start position:0%
year to this year went up by
 
05:45:53.150 --> 05:45:53.160 align:start position:0%
0.14% um all of our budgets all of our
 
05:45:54.548 --> 05:45:54.558 align:start position:0%
special education budgets and regular
 
05:45:57.468 --> 05:45:57.478 align:start position:0%
education budgets combined went up by
 
05:45:59.948 --> 05:45:59.958 align:start position:0%
0.45% um and that was totality for all
 
05:46:02.670 --> 05:46:02.680 align:start position:0%
of it for all that we that we do um so I
 
05:46:04.110 --> 05:46:04.120 align:start position:0%
shared that information with them you
 
05:46:06.548 --> 05:46:06.558 align:start position:0%
share we share um you know the big what
 
05:46:08.070 --> 05:46:08.080 align:start position:0%
some of the bigger drivers are and for
 
05:46:09.548 --> 05:46:09.558 align:start position:0%
for I think for all of us for all our
 
05:46:12.150 --> 05:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
districts human capital um salaries and
 
05:46:14.310 --> 05:46:14.320 align:start position:0%
benefits is the biggest driver and uh
 
05:46:16.390 --> 05:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
We've looked to maintain competitiveness
 
05:46:17.788 --> 05:46:17.798 align:start position:0%
with our sending towns and what they're
 
05:46:20.030 --> 05:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
paying their Educators and their support
 
05:46:21.590 --> 05:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
staff and the others around us so that
 
05:46:22.868 --> 05:46:22.878 align:start position:0%
we can make sure that we're um
 
05:46:25.590 --> 05:46:25.600 align:start position:0%
attracting top top talent top Educators
 
05:46:28.430 --> 05:46:28.440 align:start position:0%
and U maintaining them uh with us uh
 
05:46:30.628 --> 05:46:30.638 align:start position:0%
looking at our utilities and and other
 
05:46:32.830 --> 05:46:32.840 align:start position:0%
expenses like that um capital projects
 
05:46:35.070 --> 05:46:35.080 align:start position:0%
that we have um maintaining our our
 
05:46:38.030 --> 05:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
facilities and our campus sharing th
 
05:46:42.990 --> 05:46:43.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:46.150 --> 05:46:46.160 align:start position:0%
him representative Woodcock thank you
 
05:46:48.110 --> 05:46:48.120 align:start position:0%
chair good afternoon thank you for being
 
05:46:50.150 --> 05:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
here um the follow two questions will
 
05:46:52.070 --> 05:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
follow I me on representative Hall's
 
05:46:54.788 --> 05:46:54.798 align:start position:0%
question my first one is there an out in
 
05:46:58.070 --> 05:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
the contract so that students from
 
05:47:00.070 --> 05:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
Auburn or any of the ass signing towns
 
05:47:03.150 --> 05:47:03.160 align:start position:0%
do not have to go to pick iton so the in
 
05:47:04.468 --> 05:47:04.478 align:start position:0%
the agreement that I have to look at
 
05:47:07.310 --> 05:47:07.320 align:start position:0%
Auburn specifically I believe it's 90%
 
05:47:09.190 --> 05:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
okay is would would attend so there is
 
05:47:11.750 --> 05:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
the ability for 10% to and that would
 
05:47:13.750 --> 05:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
just be to attend a public or it could
 
05:47:15.830 --> 05:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
be 90 each contract is slightly
 
05:47:18.150 --> 05:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
different so it could be 90 or 95% the
 
05:47:19.990 --> 05:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
other percentage could attend any other
 
05:47:22.190 --> 05:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
public high school if a student uh or
 
05:47:24.110 --> 05:47:24.120 align:start position:0%
family chooses to send their school to a
 
05:47:26.708 --> 05:47:26.718 align:start position:0%
to a trinity or to Philips xer that
 
05:47:28.310 --> 05:47:28.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't come into play at all with those
 
05:47:31.868 --> 05:47:31.878 align:start position:0%
percentages thank you Mr chairman follow
 
05:47:33.590 --> 05:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
thank you just a follow to represent
 
05:47:35.150 --> 05:47:35.160 align:start position:0%
Paul's question
 
05:47:38.548 --> 05:47:38.558 align:start position:0%
so if I understand that that understand
 
05:47:41.390 --> 05:47:41.400 align:start position:0%
non public private I got all that and I
 
05:47:43.070 --> 05:47:43.080 align:start position:0%
understand that in your in your mind
 
05:47:44.350 --> 05:47:44.360 align:start position:0%
you're providing all the things Arin is
 
05:47:46.310 --> 05:47:46.320 align:start position:0%
asking for in their mind they're not is
 
05:47:48.150 --> 05:47:48.160 align:start position:0%
there something is there
 
05:47:51.628 --> 05:47:51.638 align:start position:0%
some specific reason why pinkton would
 
05:47:55.070 --> 05:47:55.080 align:start position:0%
not accommodate uh using the format that
 
05:47:56.948 --> 05:47:56.958 align:start position:0%
all the rest of the schools and state
 
05:48:00.230 --> 05:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
use part our contract is very specific
 
05:48:02.150 --> 05:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
with the form that's in there um and we
 
05:48:05.270 --> 05:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
look to uh tweak the the form the that
 
05:48:09.070 --> 05:48:09.080 align:start position:0%
we provide to share information um and
 
05:48:10.590 --> 05:48:10.600 align:start position:0%
our districts asked us not to one of our
 
05:48:11.830 --> 05:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
districts said no we need it in the
 
05:48:14.590 --> 05:48:14.600 align:start position:0%
exact form that's within that contract
 
05:48:17.110 --> 05:48:17.120 align:start position:0%
um so we we provide it in that in that
 
05:48:19.948 --> 05:48:19.958 align:start position:0%
format um appendix a is what it is um
 
05:48:22.310 --> 05:48:22.320 align:start position:0%
referred to as as part of the contract
 
05:48:25.310 --> 05:48:25.320 align:start position:0%
um so we go through that and do it um
 
05:48:26.990 --> 05:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
looking at doing it a different form so
 
05:48:28.310 --> 05:48:28.320 align:start position:0%
we it would just be a duplicate
 
05:48:31.868 --> 05:48:31.878 align:start position:0%
duplication of work um so initially like
 
05:48:33.070 --> 05:48:33.080 align:start position:0%
the first part of looking at it is we're
 
05:48:34.430 --> 05:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
already providing it if we're going to
 
05:48:36.110 --> 05:48:36.120 align:start position:0%
have to provide it in another format in
 
05:48:38.230 --> 05:48:38.240 align:start position:0%
another manner another way um then it's
 
05:48:39.708 --> 05:48:39.718 align:start position:0%
just it's a amount of resources that
 
05:48:42.030 --> 05:48:42.040 align:start position:0%
we're then putting into uh to produce
 
05:48:43.190 --> 05:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
that document when we're already
 
05:48:46.868 --> 05:48:46.878 align:start position:0%
providing it and it in a specific manner
 
05:48:49.310 --> 05:48:49.320 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you chair uh represent
 
05:48:52.788 --> 05:48:52.798 align:start position:0%
Terry yes thank you uh did I hear that
 
05:48:56.070 --> 05:48:56.080 align:start position:0%
you have uh contracts with six
 
05:49:00.070 --> 05:49:00.080 align:start position:0%
communities uh and if so or whatever the
 
05:49:02.350 --> 05:49:02.360 align:start position:0%
number is if you would tell me sure so I
 
05:49:04.430 --> 05:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
don't have to ask for a followup uh
 
05:49:06.990 --> 05:49:07.000 align:start position:0%
would you indicate to the committee how
 
05:49:10.030 --> 05:49:10.040 align:start position:0%
many of the other uh towns or
 
05:49:13.830 --> 05:49:13.840 align:start position:0%
communities that send you students uh
 
05:49:17.910 --> 05:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
have contracts that are I'm hearing
 
05:49:20.310 --> 05:49:20.320 align:start position:0%
boilerplate uh thrown around here as far
 
05:49:23.628 --> 05:49:23.638 align:start position:0%
as contract format so any of the other
 
05:49:25.548 --> 05:49:25.558 align:start position:0%
communities have you heard any
 
05:49:26.910 --> 05:49:26.920 align:start position:0%
expressions of
 
05:49:30.468 --> 05:49:30.478 align:start position:0%
dissatisfaction or um a desire to have
 
05:49:33.628 --> 05:49:33.638 align:start position:0%
there be compliance with um what is
 
05:49:36.468 --> 05:49:36.478 align:start position:0%
being proposed here or is this do you're
 
05:49:38.628 --> 05:49:38.638 align:start position:0%
not specific to this particular
 
05:49:41.390 --> 05:49:41.400 align:start position:0%
Community Auburn sure so we have
 
05:49:43.468 --> 05:49:43.478 align:start position:0%
contracts with six towns as seven town
 
05:49:44.708 --> 05:49:44.718 align:start position:0%
is being so we have a contract with
 
05:49:47.750 --> 05:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
Fremont that starts in 2026 so we have
 
05:49:50.310 --> 05:49:50.320 align:start position:0%
six current towns that uh that attend
 
05:49:54.190 --> 05:49:54.200 align:start position:0%
the seventh is coming on there um as far
 
05:49:58.350 --> 05:49:58.360 align:start position:0%
as concerns are uh are um raising
 
05:50:00.190 --> 05:50:00.200 align:start position:0%
questions about it I I think every town
 
05:50:01.510 --> 05:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
asks different types of questions and
 
05:50:02.868 --> 05:50:02.878 align:start position:0%
different information and that's part of
 
05:50:05.670 --> 05:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
why we've added in um producing budget
 
05:50:07.390 --> 05:50:07.400 align:start position:0%
narratives and treasure narratives to
 
05:50:10.548 --> 05:50:10.558 align:start position:0%
explain and to add um add color to the
 
05:50:12.110 --> 05:50:12.120 align:start position:0%
numbers so it's not just a num on a
 
05:50:14.030 --> 05:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet that there's there are the
 
05:50:17.670 --> 05:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
words that explain U those as well uh to
 
05:50:19.468 --> 05:50:19.478 align:start position:0%
say that all of them are asking for this
 
05:50:20.990 --> 05:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
no I mean this is the this is the first
 
05:50:23.628 --> 05:50:23.638 align:start position:0%
time that one of them is um directly
 
05:50:27.708 --> 05:50:27.718 align:start position:0%
asked uh for that specific document um
 
05:50:30.430 --> 05:50:30.440 align:start position:0%
that I'm aware of um you know so I think
 
05:50:31.910 --> 05:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
the others you know if they have
 
05:50:35.750 --> 05:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
questions they they ask and um I work
 
05:50:36.830 --> 05:50:36.840 align:start position:0%
closely with their set their
 
05:50:38.548 --> 05:50:38.558 align:start position:0%
superintendent of schools and when they
 
05:50:40.310 --> 05:50:40.320 align:start position:0%
have questions about certain things that
 
05:50:42.350 --> 05:50:42.360 align:start position:0%
they ask me we have we have good
 
05:50:44.230 --> 05:50:44.240 align:start position:0%
relationships and and share the
 
05:50:46.350 --> 05:50:46.360 align:start position:0%
information that they're asking for uh
 
05:50:50.788 --> 05:50:50.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:53.270 --> 05:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
that U I was just wondering if you have
 
05:50:55.310 --> 05:50:55.320 align:start position:0%
an idea on
 
05:50:59.788 --> 05:50:59.798 align:start position:0%
enrollment um total enrollment and uh
 
05:51:03.030 --> 05:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
how many um of those students uh come
 
05:51:07.390 --> 05:51:07.400 align:start position:0%
from the six sending towns sure uh right
 
05:51:09.548 --> 05:51:09.558 align:start position:0%
now our total enrollment as of our last
 
05:51:09.558 --> 05:51:11.510 align:start position:0%
now our total enrollment as of our last
report

05:51:11.510 --> 05:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
report
 
05:51:11.520 --> 05:51:14.430 align:start position:0%
report
was

05:51:14.430 --> 05:51:14.440 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:51:14.440 --> 05:51:16.230 align:start position:0%
was
2,980

05:51:16.230 --> 05:51:16.240 align:start position:0%
2,980
 
05:51:18.350 --> 05:51:18.360 align:start position:0%
students of
 
05:51:24.390 --> 05:51:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:28.390 --> 05:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
2,923 would be from our sending towns um
 
05:51:30.788 --> 05:51:30.798 align:start position:0%
the other students would be um private
 
05:51:35.310 --> 05:51:35.320 align:start position:0%
pay students that we accept um followup
 
05:51:40.708 --> 05:51:40.718 align:start position:0%
if I might um the uh um which we heard
 
05:51:44.030 --> 05:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
about um Regular Ed versus special ed do
 
05:51:46.350 --> 05:51:46.360 align:start position:0%
you have separate rates in your contract
 
05:51:50.628 --> 05:51:50.638 align:start position:0%
for students who um qualify as special
 
05:51:53.510 --> 05:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
needs yes yeah so our special education
 
05:51:55.990 --> 05:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
so we in know a simple way to and it's
 
05:51:58.110 --> 05:51:58.120 align:start position:0%
it's way over simplification of it is it
 
05:52:00.948 --> 05:52:00.958 align:start position:0%
an alart piece so if a student is a is a
 
05:52:03.868 --> 05:52:03.878 align:start position:0%
specialed student and they um their the
 
05:52:06.868 --> 05:52:06.878 align:start position:0%
IEP calls for and their specialed team
 
05:52:08.430 --> 05:52:08.440 align:start position:0%
decides that that's the proper placement
 
05:52:10.510 --> 05:52:10.520 align:start position:0%
for them there is a there is a different
 
05:52:12.430 --> 05:52:12.440 align:start position:0%
rate that uh that goes for them whether
 
05:52:15.868 --> 05:52:15.878 align:start position:0%
it's the the resource um or passes which
 
05:52:17.670 --> 05:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
could be addition to the regular Ed
 
05:52:20.270 --> 05:52:20.280 align:start position:0%
tuition or if it's act or NECC which
 
05:52:21.670 --> 05:52:21.680 align:start position:0%
would be just the Standalone rate that
 
05:52:24.910 --> 05:52:24.920 align:start position:0%
is charged to specifically for for those
 
05:52:29.510 --> 05:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:31.830 --> 05:52:31.840 align:start position:0%
welcome uh thank you Mr chair and thank
 
05:52:33.788 --> 05:52:33.798 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um to follow
 
05:52:36.670 --> 05:52:36.680 align:start position:0%
up on chairman cordell's question you
 
05:52:38.670 --> 05:52:38.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned you have different rates I
 
05:52:40.628 --> 05:52:40.638 align:start position:0%
know that there's also a different range
 
05:52:44.390 --> 05:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
of disabilities um do you kind of
 
05:52:47.030 --> 05:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
compound question do you take all uh
 
05:52:50.150 --> 05:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
students with all disabilities and if so
 
05:52:52.270 --> 05:52:52.280 align:start position:0%
are there different rates according to
 
05:52:54.590 --> 05:52:54.600 align:start position:0%
the disabilities correct yes
 
05:52:58.230 --> 05:52:58.240 align:start position:0%
so the the quick answer would be would
 
05:53:02.150 --> 05:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
be yes but there there are some um some
 
05:53:04.830 --> 05:53:04.840 align:start position:0%
disabilities that are are are we're not
 
05:53:08.270 --> 05:53:08.280 align:start position:0%
able to to provide um which other public
 
05:53:10.390 --> 05:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
schools are not able to provide um other
 
05:53:11.910 --> 05:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
school districts and they they have them
 
05:53:14.350 --> 05:53:14.360 align:start position:0%
for out of District placements um there
 
05:53:16.270 --> 05:53:16.280 align:start position:0%
are different rates um but we do work
 
05:53:18.310 --> 05:53:18.320 align:start position:0%
closely with our with our sending towns
 
05:53:20.830 --> 05:53:20.840 align:start position:0%
we had the NECC program was one that we
 
05:53:23.830 --> 05:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
added uh about seven years ago and that
 
05:53:25.390 --> 05:53:25.400 align:start position:0%
was in response to one of our
 
05:53:27.230 --> 05:53:27.240 align:start position:0%
communities that said that they had this
 
05:53:29.030 --> 05:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
population of students coming and they
 
05:53:30.270 --> 05:53:30.280 align:start position:0%
asked if we could take a look at it and
 
05:53:32.270 --> 05:53:32.280 align:start position:0%
if it would be a program that we could
 
05:53:35.110 --> 05:53:35.120 align:start position:0%
offer to keep those students in District
 
05:53:37.310 --> 05:53:37.320 align:start position:0%
to keep them uh to send them to us as
 
05:53:38.670 --> 05:53:38.680 align:start position:0%
opposed to sending them to an outo
 
05:53:40.788 --> 05:53:40.798 align:start position:0%
District placement um so depending upon
 
05:53:42.390 --> 05:53:42.400 align:start position:0%
the program and the intensity of the
 
05:53:44.190 --> 05:53:44.200 align:start position:0%
program and what the needs are um there
 
05:53:46.230 --> 05:53:46.240 align:start position:0%
are different rates um because the the
 
05:53:48.990 --> 05:53:49.000 align:start position:0%
NECC program is with us year round
 
05:53:50.430 --> 05:53:50.440 align:start position:0%
except for like two weeks in August the
 
05:53:53.948 --> 05:53:53.958 align:start position:0%
ACT program is with us for um 11 months
 
05:53:55.670 --> 05:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
they're not with us for the basically
 
05:53:57.110 --> 05:53:57.120 align:start position:0%
most of them not all of the month of
 
05:53:59.070 --> 05:53:59.080 align:start position:0%
August um so the different rates are
 
05:54:00.708 --> 05:54:00.718 align:start position:0%
there and then based on the other two
 
05:54:03.430 --> 05:54:03.440 align:start position:0%
programs based on what the needs are and
 
05:54:04.868 --> 05:54:04.878 align:start position:0%
um in order to meet those needs there
 
05:54:06.468 --> 05:54:06.478 align:start position:0%
are different rates for the other two
 
05:54:08.310 --> 05:54:08.320 align:start position:0%
programs as
 
05:54:10.468 --> 05:54:10.478 align:start position:0%
well rep
 
05:54:13.750 --> 05:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you Mr chair um with regard
 
05:54:15.628 --> 05:54:15.638 align:start position:0%
to your rate setting and and special
 
05:54:16.990 --> 05:54:17.000 align:start position:0%
education rates how are you
 
05:54:19.030 --> 05:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
differentiating the rates specifically
 
05:54:21.510 --> 05:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
with regard to parity in in the Learners
 
05:54:23.868 --> 05:54:23.878 align:start position:0%
based on the specific needs that they
 
05:54:27.430 --> 05:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
might have so there it it depend on so
 
05:54:29.310 --> 05:54:29.320 align:start position:0%
there's four main programs which is re
 
05:54:31.590 --> 05:54:31.600 align:start position:0%
we call it our resource program um which
 
05:54:33.070 --> 05:54:33.080 align:start position:0%
is the most common that's the biggest
 
05:54:36.670 --> 05:54:36.680 align:start position:0%
program of all um we have uh roughly 00
 
05:54:38.590 --> 05:54:38.600 align:start position:0%
students that are within that program um
 
05:54:40.788 --> 05:54:40.798 align:start position:0%
and that would be like the if we're
 
05:54:42.590 --> 05:54:42.600 align:start position:0%
thinking of special ed that would be the
 
05:54:44.670 --> 05:54:44.680 align:start position:0%
the lowest tier meaning the the they
 
05:54:46.590 --> 05:54:46.600 align:start position:0%
would need the least amount of
 
05:54:49.670 --> 05:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
interventions um for special education
 
05:54:51.868 --> 05:54:51.878 align:start position:0%
uh they have a a specific uh resource
 
05:54:53.868 --> 05:54:53.878 align:start position:0%
room where they go where they get extra
 
05:54:56.390 --> 05:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
supports whether it is about um on
 
05:54:57.990 --> 05:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
Executive functioning or if their
 
05:55:00.190 --> 05:55:00.200 align:start position:0%
disability is math related or or reading
 
05:55:01.868 --> 05:55:01.878 align:start position:0%
related where they get extra Services
 
05:55:04.590 --> 05:55:04.600 align:start position:0%
there um within that program the program
 
05:55:07.230 --> 05:55:07.240 align:start position:0%
is designed to meet those various needs
 
05:55:09.110 --> 05:55:09.120 align:start position:0%
in this in that capacity in that level
 
05:55:10.510 --> 05:55:10.520 align:start position:0%
so it's even though there are various
 
05:55:13.270 --> 05:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
needs within the level um there are
 
05:55:14.948 --> 05:55:14.958 align:start position:0%
they're relatively the same when you
 
05:55:16.310 --> 05:55:16.320 align:start position:0%
look at whether it's the math the
 
05:55:18.708 --> 05:55:18.718 align:start position:0%
executive functioning ADHD whatever
 
05:55:20.868 --> 05:55:20.878 align:start position:0%
whatever that may be the amount of work
 
05:55:22.628 --> 05:55:22.638 align:start position:0%
that takes to meet those is relatively
 
05:55:24.270 --> 05:55:24.280 align:start position:0%
the same so that's why the cost for that
 
05:55:26.708 --> 05:55:26.718 align:start position:0%
program um you can have a variety of
 
05:55:29.590 --> 05:55:29.600 align:start position:0%
reasons for the needs there but it's all
 
05:55:31.270 --> 05:55:31.280 align:start position:0%
the same there when you get into the
 
05:55:32.830 --> 05:55:32.840 align:start position:0%
other ones that's when the needs become
 
05:55:36.430 --> 05:55:36.440 align:start position:0%
more intense um or more more is needed
 
05:55:37.910 --> 05:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
um so whether it's the the emotional
 
05:55:40.830 --> 05:55:40.840 align:start position:0%
support that's needed um or if it's uh
 
05:55:44.350 --> 05:55:44.360 align:start position:0%
different physical or um mental uh
 
05:55:46.670 --> 05:55:46.680 align:start position:0%
handicaps that are that are needed to um
 
05:55:48.910 --> 05:55:48.920 align:start position:0%
have Services provided um that go into
 
05:55:50.590 --> 05:55:50.600 align:start position:0%
th those specific programs and there's
 
05:55:53.430 --> 05:55:53.440 align:start position:0%
more time and more um work needed
 
05:55:56.990 --> 05:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
whether it's through speech OT uh PT um
 
05:55:58.868 --> 05:55:58.878 align:start position:0%
even within the classroom U the
 
05:56:00.910 --> 05:56:00.920 align:start position:0%
different life skills and the courses
 
05:56:02.510 --> 05:56:02.520 align:start position:0%
that those students could
 
05:56:08.030 --> 05:56:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:09.708 --> 05:56:09.718 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
05:56:12.390 --> 05:56:12.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question so I I have my public
 
05:56:14.030 --> 05:56:14.040 align:start position:0%
school hat on right now and I know you
 
05:56:16.270 --> 05:56:16.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned independent so I'm hoping that
 
05:56:18.548 --> 05:56:18.558 align:start position:0%
you can just help walk me through this
 
05:56:20.910 --> 05:56:20.920 align:start position:0%
when you mentioned that they're giving
 
05:56:23.110 --> 05:56:23.120 align:start position:0%
the they're given the cost per student
 
05:56:25.270 --> 05:56:25.280 align:start position:0%
is that just based on expenses or are
 
05:56:27.750 --> 05:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
revenues being shared with the sending
 
05:56:29.990 --> 05:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
towns uh so the the revenues are being
 
05:56:32.948 --> 05:56:32.958 align:start position:0%
shared as well um with the the fact that
 
05:56:34.390 --> 05:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
what we charged for the tuition was the
 
05:56:36.430 --> 05:56:36.440 align:start position:0%
amount of money that we brought in um to
 
05:56:38.868 --> 05:56:38.878 align:start position:0%
offset that and then the expenses or
 
05:56:41.548 --> 05:56:41.558 align:start position:0%
what what it cost based off of um the
 
05:56:43.590 --> 05:56:43.600 align:start position:0%
expenses for the year for those specific
 
05:56:47.150 --> 05:56:47.160 align:start position:0%
programs so may I follow
 
05:56:50.350 --> 05:56:50.360 align:start position:0%
up so what I'm what I'm trying to
 
05:56:51.788 --> 05:56:51.798 align:start position:0%
understand I think I hear what you're
 
05:56:54.190 --> 05:56:54.200 align:start position:0%
saying but what I'm trying to understand
 
05:56:56.270 --> 05:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
is private schools different they're
 
05:56:57.590 --> 05:56:57.600 align:start position:0%
going to have these meetings behind
 
05:56:59.830 --> 05:56:59.840 align:start position:0%
closed doors right Public Schools you
 
05:57:01.830 --> 05:57:01.840 align:start position:0%
would have these meetings out in the
 
05:57:03.750 --> 05:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
open I was wondering if number one if
 
05:57:06.788 --> 05:57:06.798 align:start position:0%
these meetings are public and number two
 
05:57:08.750 --> 05:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
the forms that go to the doe I can't
 
05:57:11.510 --> 05:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
remember either if it's Ms 25 2710 I
 
05:57:14.230 --> 05:57:14.240 align:start position:0%
forget at this point uh but that would
 
05:57:16.868 --> 05:57:16.878 align:start position:0%
actually disclose the revenues and the
 
05:57:18.948 --> 05:57:18.958 align:start position:0%
expenses to get to the I feel like I'm
 
05:57:21.230 --> 05:57:21.240 align:start position:0%
hearing that's what Auburn is looking
 
05:57:23.110 --> 05:57:23.120 align:start position:0%
for but I maybe
 
05:57:27.070 --> 05:57:27.080 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding yeah so um yeah I I'll
 
05:57:29.548 --> 05:57:29.558 align:start position:0%
leave this so that uh everyone will be
 
05:57:32.830 --> 05:57:32.840 align:start position:0%
able to see um what it is in there here
 
05:57:36.430 --> 05:57:36.440 align:start position:0%
here but uh on it it it lists the it's
 
05:57:38.468 --> 05:57:38.478 align:start position:0%
it's on the expense side of it so our
 
05:57:40.628 --> 05:57:40.638 align:start position:0%
revenue is the cost the tuition that we
 
05:57:43.670 --> 05:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
charged so when we go and look at it um
 
05:57:45.190 --> 05:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
we know we had our tuition rate times
 
05:57:46.548 --> 05:57:46.558 align:start position:0%
the the number of students that was our
 
05:57:49.430 --> 05:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
revenue and then we have our expenses um
 
05:57:54.750 --> 05:57:54.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:57.910 --> 05:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
that thank you and so I just want to
 
05:57:59.708 --> 05:57:59.718 align:start position:0%
make sure again I understand so there
 
05:58:02.110 --> 05:58:02.120 align:start position:0%
are no other Revenue I heard you say the
 
05:58:04.070 --> 05:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
state goes to the town you're saying
 
05:58:06.110 --> 05:58:06.120 align:start position:0%
there are no other Revenue sources what
 
05:58:08.110 --> 05:58:08.120 align:start position:0%
ever other than the sending towns so
 
05:58:09.468 --> 05:58:09.478 align:start position:0%
that's why it's such a
 
05:58:12.110 --> 05:58:12.120 align:start position:0%
simplified um calculation any other
 
05:58:14.230 --> 05:58:14.240 align:start position:0%
revenues we have like we we do uh we
 
05:58:16.230 --> 05:58:16.240 align:start position:0%
fund raise and we do advancement efforts
 
05:58:18.548 --> 05:58:18.558 align:start position:0%
there um that the monies that are there
 
05:58:20.708 --> 05:58:20.718 align:start position:0%
those are not um expenses that are
 
05:58:23.270 --> 05:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
charged to the town um so that is that
 
05:58:24.948 --> 05:58:24.958 align:start position:0%
is completely separate so there there
 
05:58:26.070 --> 05:58:26.080 align:start position:0%
are certain things that we've gone out
 
05:58:28.628 --> 05:58:28.638 align:start position:0%
and we've fundraised for um we installed
 
05:58:31.628 --> 05:58:31.638 align:start position:0%
two uh artificial tur Fields um we we
 
05:58:34.270 --> 05:58:34.280 align:start position:0%
fundraised the money to install those
 
05:58:36.150 --> 05:58:36.160 align:start position:0%
fields um so that was not part of the
 
05:58:38.350 --> 05:58:38.360 align:start position:0%
tuition so that was not part of of our
 
05:58:41.190 --> 05:58:41.200 align:start position:0%
expense and um revenue for that f for
 
05:58:43.190 --> 05:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
those fiscal years that it
 
05:58:46.468 --> 05:58:46.478 align:start position:0%
encompassed thank you you're
 
05:58:48.430 --> 05:58:48.440 align:start position:0%
welcome representative Freeman did you
 
05:58:51.110 --> 05:58:51.120 align:start position:0%

of us so I I I also have a question
 
05:58:57.190 --> 05:58:57.200 align:start position:0%
about how you're reporting out seeing as
 
05:59:01.150 --> 05:59:01.160 align:start position:0%
you're a a a nonprofit private school
 
05:59:04.750 --> 05:59:04.760 align:start position:0%
and you're designated as
 
05:59:07.708 --> 05:59:07.718 align:start position:0%
a as a nonprofit with the federal
 
05:59:09.910 --> 05:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
government do you have to submit
 
05:59:11.868 --> 05:59:11.878 align:start position:0%
financials to the State Department of
 
05:59:14.430 --> 05:59:14.440 align:start position:0%
Education such as a traditional public
 
05:59:19.030 --> 05:59:19.040 align:start position:0%
school or chatter school um and I I I'm
 
05:59:20.990 --> 05:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
curious about that the the the reports
 
05:59:22.910 --> 05:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
that we send to this the to our sending
 
05:59:25.270 --> 05:59:25.280 align:start position:0%
districts we send those same reports to
 
05:59:27.590 --> 05:59:27.600 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire education department
 
05:59:30.390 --> 05:59:30.400 align:start position:0%
and they and may I have a followup yes
 
05:59:32.788 --> 05:59:32.798 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you um so they would
 
05:59:36.030 --> 05:59:36.040 align:start position:0%
they look like the traditional yeah
 
05:59:37.990 --> 05:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
budgets that are submitted to the to the
 
05:59:40.350 --> 05:59:40.360 align:start position:0%
state doe are they different because you
 
05:59:42.670 --> 05:59:42.680 align:start position:0%
are a nonprofit private correct they are
 
05:59:44.390 --> 05:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
different than because we are a
 
05:59:46.868 --> 05:59:46.878 align:start position:0%
nonprofit private um so our format is
 
05:59:48.788 --> 05:59:48.798 align:start position:0%
different than what the traditional
 
05:59:53.510 --> 05:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
Public School form would be thank you

Hampshire 18 Town Farm Road um I spent
 
06:01:23.150 --> 06:01:23.160 align:start position:0%
19 years as a member of the Chester
 
06:01:26.468 --> 06:01:26.478 align:start position:0%
School Board uh retiring from office in
 
06:01:29.350 --> 06:01:29.360 align:start position:0%
2024 uh most of that time I spent as the
 
06:01:31.750 --> 06:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
chair of the board so I spent a lot of
 
06:01:34.070 --> 06:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
time working with Pinkerton on budgeting
 
06:01:37.110 --> 06:01:37.120 align:start position:0%
and financing I did provide a written uh
 
06:01:38.948 --> 06:01:38.958 align:start position:0%
testimony for you folks which I sent to
 
06:01:40.310 --> 06:01:40.320 align:start position:0%
the chairman and the vice chairman and
 
06:01:42.910 --> 06:01:42.920 align:start position:0%

brief um thank you for allowing me to
 
06:01:49.030 --> 06:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
testify today one aspect of this bill
 
06:01:50.990 --> 06:01:51.000 align:start position:0%
that I feel is critical is that it would
 
06:01:54.910 --> 06:01:54.920 align:start position:0%
require under title 198 section 1984 co-
 
06:01:57.548 --> 06:01:57.558 align:start position:0%
D that a financial report for each
 
06:02:00.868 --> 06:02:00.878 align:start position:0%
public Academy shall be filed showing
 
06:02:02.708 --> 06:02:02.718 align:start position:0%
the summary of receipts expenditures
 
06:02:04.590 --> 06:02:04.600 align:start position:0%
according to uniform classifications
 
06:02:07.310 --> 06:02:07.320 align:start position:0%
during the proceeding fiscal year and a
 
06:02:08.830 --> 06:02:08.840 align:start position:0%
balance sheet showing assets and
 
06:02:11.230 --> 06:02:11.240 align:start position:0%
liabilities at the close of each year
 
06:02:13.190 --> 06:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
each statistical report submitted under
 
06:02:15.070 --> 06:02:15.080 align:start position:0%
this section shall include
 
06:02:16.948 --> 06:02:16.958 align:start position:0%
certifications signed by the chairperson
 
06:02:19.190 --> 06:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
of the appropriate governing body the
 
06:02:21.510 --> 06:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
Board of Trustees of approved public
 
06:02:23.350 --> 06:02:23.360 align:start position:0%
academies under the pains and penalties
 
06:02:25.548 --> 06:02:25.558 align:start position:0%
of perjury that all the information
 
06:02:27.230 --> 06:02:27.240 align:start position:0%
contained in this document is true
 
06:02:29.070 --> 06:02:29.080 align:start position:0%
accurate and complete that's the same
 
06:02:30.430 --> 06:02:30.440 align:start position:0%
requirement that every School board
 
06:02:33.190 --> 06:02:33.200 align:start position:0%
chairman has to meet each year this
 
06:02:34.788 --> 06:02:34.798 align:start position:0%
would bring the financial reporting of
 
06:02:36.868 --> 06:02:36.878 align:start position:0%
publicy such as Pinkerton Academy and
 
06:02:38.830 --> 06:02:38.840 align:start position:0%
dairy in alignment with the financial
 
06:02:40.628 --> 06:02:40.638 align:start position:0%
reporting obligations of local school
 
06:02:42.990 --> 06:02:43.000 align:start position:0%
districts in New Hampshire as I
 
06:02:44.750 --> 06:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned I spent 19 years as a member
 
06:02:46.948 --> 06:02:46.958 align:start position:0%
of the and frequent chair of the Chester
 
06:02:49.070 --> 06:02:49.080 align:start position:0%
School Board the Chester school district
 
06:02:50.750 --> 06:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
is one of the sending school districts
 
06:02:52.990 --> 06:02:53.000 align:start position:0%
that has a tuition agreement to send our
 
06:02:55.030 --> 06:02:55.040 align:start position:0%
grade 9 through 12 students to Pinkerton
 
06:02:57.750 --> 06:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
Academy for their high school
 
06:03:00.190 --> 06:03:00.200 align:start position:0%
education uh similar to Auburn actually
 
06:03:01.670 --> 06:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
longer than auburn I guess this is a
 
06:03:03.350 --> 06:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
long-standing agreement that's stating
 
06:03:05.030 --> 06:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
back decades originally signed in the
 
06:03:05.040 --> 06:03:06.310 align:start position:0%
back decades originally signed in the
1960s

06:03:06.310 --> 06:03:06.320 align:start position:0%
1960s
 
06:03:08.150 --> 06:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
to be clear I fully believe that sending
 
06:03:10.190 --> 06:03:10.200 align:start position:0%
Chester students to Pinkerton Academy is
 
06:03:12.590 --> 06:03:12.600 align:start position:0%
the best option for our community and in
 
06:03:15.230 --> 06:03:15.240 align:start position:0%
fact I was responsible for negotiating a
 
06:03:17.430 --> 06:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
a rewrite and a renewal of the current
 
06:03:20.948 --> 06:03:20.958 align:start position:0%
governing tuition agreement on several
 
06:03:22.948 --> 06:03:22.958 align:start position:0%
occasions as an elected member of the
 
06:03:24.750 --> 06:03:24.760 align:start position:0%
Chester School Board my charge was to
 
06:03:26.868 --> 06:03:26.878 align:start position:0%
represent our community's taxpayers and
 
06:03:28.990 --> 06:03:29.000 align:start position:0%
to do due diligence when authorizing the
 
06:03:31.750 --> 06:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
expenditures of any taxpayer funds the
 
06:03:34.350 --> 06:03:34.360 align:start position:0%
Chester School District typically spends
 
06:03:36.628 --> 06:03:36.638 align:start position:0%
SE several million dollars each year in
 
06:03:39.190 --> 06:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
tuition payments at to Pinker Academy it
 
06:03:41.948 --> 06:03:41.958 align:start position:0%
represents approximately 25 to 30% of
 
06:03:43.548 --> 06:03:43.558 align:start position:0%
the district's annual budget each year
 
06:03:45.788 --> 06:03:45.798 align:start position:0%
to support approximately onethird of our
 
06:03:49.430 --> 06:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
total student body uh approximately 250
 
06:03:51.750 --> 06:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
students at pinkton about 500 students
 
06:03:54.788 --> 06:03:54.798 align:start position:0%
at 10K through 8 at Chester Academy the
 
06:03:56.350 --> 06:03:56.360 align:start position:0%
lack of transparency when dealing with
 
06:03:57.948 --> 06:03:57.958 align:start position:0%
pinkerton's Board of Trustees on
 
06:04:00.070 --> 06:04:00.080 align:start position:0%
financial matters was a consistent
 
06:04:02.230 --> 06:04:02.240 align:start position:0%
source of frustration over my term on
 
06:04:04.548 --> 06:04:04.558 align:start position:0%
the Chester School Board while a bottom
 
06:04:06.270 --> 06:04:06.280 align:start position:0%
line figure for the annual Pinkerton
 
06:04:08.230 --> 06:04:08.240 align:start position:0%
Academy operating budget was furnished
 
06:04:10.110 --> 06:04:10.120 align:start position:0%
each year in order to justify the annual
 
06:04:12.868 --> 06:04:12.878 align:start position:0%
T tuition rate calculation the details
 
06:04:14.548 --> 06:04:14.558 align:start position:0%
were usually tightly held by the
 
06:04:16.708 --> 06:04:16.718 align:start position:0%
trustees it was only through persistent
 
06:04:17.990 --> 06:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
questioning and negotiating that
 
06:04:20.110 --> 06:04:20.120 align:start position:0%
specific details of the expenditures
 
06:04:21.670 --> 06:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
might be provided but the seldom
 
06:04:23.788 --> 06:04:23.798 align:start position:0%
provided the level of transparency that
 
06:04:27.110 --> 06:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
is required of a public school district
 
06:04:28.670 --> 06:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
given that the tuition charge by the
 
06:04:31.030 --> 06:04:31.040 align:start position:0%
academy is funded by taxpayer dollars it
 
06:04:32.830 --> 06:04:32.840 align:start position:0%
is an ongoing frustration for Local
 
06:04:34.670 --> 06:04:34.680 align:start position:0%
School District board members that they
 
06:04:36.788 --> 06:04:36.798 align:start position:0%
are not able to easily account for how
 
06:04:38.750 --> 06:04:38.760 align:start position:0%
these taxpayer dollars paid to the
 
06:04:41.390 --> 06:04:41.400 align:start position:0%
academy are actually being spent and for
 
06:04:44.230 --> 06:04:44.240 align:start position:0%
what purpose the proposed change under
 
06:04:45.990 --> 06:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
consideration today would simply hold
 
06:04:48.350 --> 06:04:48.360 align:start position:0%
the Publicis to the same reporting
 
06:04:50.590 --> 06:04:50.600 align:start position:0%
standards as local school districts
 
06:04:52.830 --> 06:04:52.840 align:start position:0%
regarding the expenditure funds received
 
06:04:54.548 --> 06:04:54.558 align:start position:0%
as Revenue in the form of tuition
 
06:04:56.868 --> 06:04:56.878 align:start position:0%
payments which are provided by local
 
06:04:59.270 --> 06:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
taxpayers I do not see this reporting
 
06:05:01.468 --> 06:05:01.478 align:start position:0%
requirement as burdensome but simply an
 
06:05:03.548 --> 06:05:03.558 align:start position:0%
extension of good accounting practices
 
06:05:05.788 --> 06:05:05.798 align:start position:0%
transparency and a true partnership with
 
06:05:10.030 --> 06:05:10.040 align:start position:0%
the representatives of the local school
 
06:05:12.350 --> 06:05:12.360 align:start position:0%
districts to be clear the intent of this
 
06:05:14.190 --> 06:05:14.200 align:start position:0%
change is not intended to restrict or
 
06:05:16.468 --> 06:05:16.478 align:start position:0%
change the Board of Trustees existing
 
06:05:18.628 --> 06:05:18.638 align:start position:0%
prioritization or decision-making
 
06:05:20.628 --> 06:05:20.638 align:start position:0%
process regarding expenditures
 
06:05:22.948 --> 06:05:22.958 align:start position:0%
associated with their operating budget
 
06:05:24.590 --> 06:05:24.600 align:start position:0%
however it is about transparency
 
06:05:26.830 --> 06:05:26.840 align:start position:0%
regarding the use of taxpayer dollars
 
06:05:29.310 --> 06:05:29.320 align:start position:0%
supporting that budget for this reason I
 
06:05:31.110 --> 06:05:31.120 align:start position:0%
urge the members of this house education
 
06:05:32.910 --> 06:05:32.920 align:start position:0%
policy and administration committee and
 
06:05:35.150 --> 06:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
your colleagues in the legislature to
 
06:05:36.830 --> 06:05:36.840 align:start position:0%
support this bill brought to you today
 
06:05:39.750 --> 06:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
by Representatives Edmunds and Moffett
 
06:05:41.788 --> 06:05:41.798 align:start position:0%
Edwards and Moffett excuse me I would
 
06:05:43.430 --> 06:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
also like to commend my former colleague
 
06:05:45.750 --> 06:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
Au School Board chair Alan Viller for
 
06:05:47.948 --> 06:05:47.958 align:start position:0%
taking on this issue and initiating
 
06:05:49.430 --> 06:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
these discussions with representative
 
06:05:51.670 --> 06:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
Edwards the adoption of the language and
 
06:05:54.070 --> 06:05:54.080 align:start position:0%
House Bill 116 as presented would
 
06:05:55.830 --> 06:05:55.840 align:start position:0%
clearly correct a serious shortcoming
 
06:05:58.510 --> 06:05:58.520 align:start position:0%
that has existed for many years thank
 
06:05:59.708 --> 06:05:59.718 align:start position:0%

and you said you submitted your uh
 
06:06:10.750 --> 06:06:10.760 align:start position:0%
written testimony via email yes I did
 
06:06:13.110 --> 06:06:13.120 align:start position:0%
yesterday we'll we'll look for
 
06:06:17.430 --> 06:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
that um questions representative
 
06:06:22.310 --> 06:06:22.320 align:start position:0%
litfield thank you and thank you I I'm
 
06:06:24.788 --> 06:06:24.798 align:start position:0%
trying to understand here I I I can see
 
06:06:27.110 --> 06:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
where you're coming from but my question
 
06:06:29.548 --> 06:06:29.558 align:start position:0%
is we're talking about they owe
 
06:06:31.390 --> 06:06:31.400 align:start position:0%
accountability to the taxpayers but
 
06:06:33.708 --> 06:06:33.718 align:start position:0%
you've entered into a private contract
 
06:06:35.708 --> 06:06:35.718 align:start position:0%
with them haven't you it's your account
 
06:06:37.628 --> 06:06:37.638 align:start position:0%
ability is to the taxpayers or the six
 
06:06:41.628 --> 06:06:41.638 align:start position:0%
sending towns and right now am I
 
06:06:42.868 --> 06:06:42.878 align:start position:0%
understanding correctly that I believe
 
06:06:45.230 --> 06:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
the average cost per student is 19,000
 
06:06:47.030 --> 06:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire 19,000
 
06:06:49.628 --> 06:06:49.638 align:start position:0%
plus 20,000 actually 20,000 okay and
 
06:06:53.150 --> 06:06:53.160 align:start position:0%
Pinkerton is educating at
 
06:06:55.948 --> 06:06:55.958 align:start position:0%
16,38 per student Ju Just to be clear
 
06:06:57.868 --> 06:06:57.878 align:start position:0%
that's their calculation not one created
 
06:07:00.390 --> 06:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
by the State Department of Education I'm
 
06:07:02.110 --> 06:07:02.120 align:start position:0%
just wondering if this is outside figure
 
06:07:03.948 --> 06:07:03.958 align:start position:0%
you're using is calculated by the state
 
06:07:07.390 --> 06:07:07.400 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire calculated by Pinkerton
 
06:07:11.270 --> 06:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:14.030 --> 06:07:14.040 align:start position:0%
you and actually the the cost of
 
06:07:15.708 --> 06:07:15.718 align:start position:0%
education for student in Chester I think
 
06:07:20.868 --> 06:07:20.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:24.190 --> 06:07:24.200 align:start position:0%
17,36 uh further questions from Mr
 
06:07:26.910 --> 06:07:26.920 align:start position:0%
Richardson uh representative Woodcock Mr
 
06:07:28.190 --> 06:07:28.200 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you the question actually
 
06:07:31.990 --> 06:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
is for you yes or um not the speaker um
 
06:07:34.230 --> 06:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
would this impact Cole Brown as well if
 
06:07:37.628 --> 06:07:37.638 align:start position:0%
this bill passed in your that's my
 
06:07:41.510 --> 06:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:45.628 --> 06:07:45.638 align:start position:0%

congratulate you all on your appointment

to this new committee and look forward
 
06:10:43.270 --> 06:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
to seeing the work that you guys do HB
 
06:10:46.070 --> 06:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
1884 was brought forward because of a
 
06:10:48.628 --> 06:10:48.638 align:start position:0%
group of parents that came to me in my
 
06:10:50.990 --> 06:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
district and told me about how they were
 
06:10:54.310 --> 06:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
concerned about how early their students
 
06:10:56.948 --> 06:10:56.958 align:start position:0%
their children were waking up and uh I
 
06:10:59.070 --> 06:10:59.080 align:start position:0%
know that because I remember having to
 
06:11:02.548 --> 06:11:02.558 align:start position:0%
get up at 6:00 in the morning to if not
 
06:11:05.948 --> 06:11:05.958 align:start position:0%
earlier to make the bus at 6:30 uh and
 
06:11:08.868 --> 06:11:08.878 align:start position:0%
going to class at the 7:30 hour during
 
06:11:12.390 --> 06:11:12.400 align:start position:0%
the first period uh and I remember how
 
06:11:14.270 --> 06:11:14.280 align:start position:0%
that affected the day when you're a
 
06:11:17.430 --> 06:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
student in school and how that makes it
 
06:11:19.948 --> 06:11:19.958 align:start position:0%
significantly more difficult to go about
 
06:11:22.350 --> 06:11:22.360 align:start position:0%
the day when you have your first period
 
06:11:24.110 --> 06:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
as I said in my written testimony
 
06:11:27.230 --> 06:11:27.240 align:start position:0%
whether it's algebra or photo and video
 
06:11:29.270 --> 06:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
those classes are significantly harder
 
06:11:31.868 --> 06:11:31.878 align:start position:0%
when you're starting so early in the day
 
06:11:34.310 --> 06:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
uh so what I decided after researching
 
06:11:35.708 --> 06:11:35.718 align:start position:0%
this issue over the course course of the
 
06:11:38.708 --> 06:11:38.718 align:start position:0%
last year was that a stick was not the
 
06:11:41.910 --> 06:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
right approach to this legislation the
 
06:11:44.350 --> 06:11:44.360 align:start position:0%
issue is significantly complex and there
 
06:11:47.150 --> 06:11:47.160 align:start position:0%
are as I'm don't need to tell this
 
06:11:49.468 --> 06:11:49.478 align:start position:0%
committee a number of complexities
 
06:11:51.310 --> 06:11:51.320 align:start position:0%
around the start of school whether that
 
06:11:54.230 --> 06:11:54.240 align:start position:0%
be the student schedules the teacher
 
06:11:57.628 --> 06:11:57.638 align:start position:0%
schedules the busing companies servicing
 
06:11:59.310 --> 06:11:59.320 align:start position:0%
multiple districts throughout the state
 
06:12:00.830 --> 06:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
that start at different times and the
 
06:12:02.948 --> 06:12:02.958 align:start position:0%
buses using those different school
 
06:12:06.430 --> 06:12:06.440 align:start position:0%
districts start times to
 
06:12:09.670 --> 06:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
pick up people at a certain time uh so
 
06:12:12.548 --> 06:12:12.558 align:start position:0%
this is a very complex issue and moving
 
06:12:16.548 --> 06:12:16.558 align:start position:0%
forward with a stick by saying here's a
 
06:12:18.350 --> 06:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
mandate from the state you will all
 
06:12:20.910 --> 06:12:20.920 align:start position:0%
start at X time would not be the way to
 
06:12:24.230 --> 06:12:24.240 align:start position:0%
do it so I proposed a legislative study
 
06:12:26.070 --> 06:12:26.080 align:start position:0%
committee made up of members of the
 
06:12:28.350 --> 06:12:28.360 align:start position:0%
house and the Senate to look at this
 
06:12:30.750 --> 06:12:30.760 align:start position:0%
issue which people across the state are
 
06:12:32.948 --> 06:12:32.958 align:start position:0%
concerned over you'll have in your email
 
06:12:32.958 --> 06:12:35.310 align:start position:0%
concerned over you'll have in your email
a

06:12:35.310 --> 06:12:35.320 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:12:38.270 --> 06:12:38.280 align:start position:0%
correspondents from members of school
 
06:12:41.868 --> 06:12:41.878 align:start position:0%
boards from nsha and conal and a few
 
06:12:44.868 --> 06:12:44.878 align:start position:0%
others who I've spoken to about this
 
06:12:46.910 --> 06:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
issue there will be Educators that reach
 
06:12:49.430 --> 06:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
out to you and students and parents and
 
06:12:51.150 --> 06:12:51.160 align:start position:0%
I have a few parents and students here
 
06:12:54.030 --> 06:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
today that uh took the time to come out
 
06:12:56.270 --> 06:12:56.280 align:start position:0%
and speak to you about why they'd like
 
06:12:59.628 --> 06:12:59.638 align:start position:0%
to find a way to make their school start
 
06:13:01.788 --> 06:13:01.798 align:start position:0%
a little later people have gone to their
 
06:13:03.708 --> 06:13:03.718 align:start position:0%
school boards across the state and have
 
06:13:05.750 --> 06:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
been told by their school
 
06:13:08.390 --> 06:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
boards their school board members that
 
06:13:11.190 --> 06:13:11.200 align:start position:0%
this is such a complex issue that it's
 
06:13:13.910 --> 06:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
one the state should study and look at
 
06:13:17.708 --> 06:13:17.718 align:start position:0%
before we can move forward on so I'm
 
06:13:20.788 --> 06:13:20.798 align:start position:0%
here today uh to move that forward so
 
06:13:22.510 --> 06:13:22.520 align:start position:0%
that those parents that are across the
 
06:13:24.708 --> 06:13:24.718 align:start position:0%
state trying to make sure that their
 
06:13:28.350 --> 06:13:28.360 align:start position:0%
kids are healthy and public schools are
 
06:13:31.310 --> 06:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
heard and I thank you all very much for
 
06:13:33.030 --> 06:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
the time that you have given me and
 
06:13:35.310 --> 06:13:35.320 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions
 
06:13:37.430 --> 06:13:37.440 align:start position:0%

attend the oyer River School District um
 
06:13:59.468 --> 06:13:59.478 align:start position:0%
I think it was I don't know 15 years ago
 
06:14:01.190 --> 06:14:01.200 align:start position:0%
a group of parents went before our
 
06:14:03.190 --> 06:14:03.200 align:start position:0%
school board and said we have a problem
 
06:14:05.310 --> 06:14:05.320 align:start position:0%
with school start times we' like to
 
06:14:06.628 --> 06:14:06.638 align:start position:0%
create a study committee the school
 
06:14:09.468 --> 06:14:09.478 align:start position:0%
board approved it approved a local study
 
06:14:11.310 --> 06:14:11.320 align:start position:0%
committee they came back with their
 
06:14:13.868 --> 06:14:13.878 align:start position:0%
report and there was a meeting of the
 
06:14:15.430 --> 06:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
town where there were I think three
 
06:14:17.750 --> 06:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
public hearings and as a result we
 
06:14:20.030 --> 06:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
changed our school start times um which
 
06:14:21.310 --> 06:14:21.320 align:start position:0%
we were able to do because we have our
 
06:14:23.510 --> 06:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
own internal bus system that manages our
 
06:14:25.230 --> 06:14:25.240 align:start position:0%
students although it was still
 
06:14:28.230 --> 06:14:28.240 align:start position:0%
incredibly complicated to do and very
 
06:14:31.708 --> 06:14:31.718 align:start position:0%
specific to managing our four schools
 
06:14:34.350 --> 06:14:34.360 align:start position:0%
buses and then coordinating with the CTE
 
06:14:35.910 --> 06:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
that had different start times for the
 
06:14:37.468 --> 06:14:37.478 align:start position:0%
high school students to navigate all of
 
06:14:40.270 --> 06:14:40.280 align:start position:0%
that but I'm curious why you think that
 
06:14:42.390 --> 06:14:42.400 align:start position:0%
school boards wouldn't allow parents to
 
06:14:44.708 --> 06:14:44.718 align:start position:0%
create a committee within their own town
 
06:14:47.628 --> 06:14:47.638 align:start position:0%
to study this and and make sure that
 
06:14:49.910 --> 06:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
it's truly local control around what's
 
06:14:51.990 --> 06:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
best for that individual town or school
 
06:14:53.350 --> 06:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
district and we're part of a Cooperative
 
06:14:55.310 --> 06:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
District to be clear well thank you for
 
06:14:57.190 --> 06:14:57.200 align:start position:0%
that question I have in my notes here
 
06:15:00.110 --> 06:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
that Oyster River is a district that
 
06:15:02.390 --> 06:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
moved forward on this and Kenai has had
 
06:15:03.868 --> 06:15:03.878 align:start position:0%
conversations conille has had
 
06:15:05.548 --> 06:15:05.558 align:start position:0%
conversations and
 
06:15:07.948 --> 06:15:07.958 align:start position:0%
uh I believe I'm missing one but but
 
06:15:09.190 --> 06:15:09.200 align:start position:0%
that's okay there are there are
 
06:15:11.830 --> 06:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
districts that are talking about this
 
06:15:13.310 --> 06:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
and it's not to say that every District
 
06:15:15.510 --> 06:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
in the state wouldn't move forward on
 
06:15:17.990 --> 06:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
that it's that uh people have been met
 
06:15:20.590 --> 06:15:20.600 align:start position:0%
with this is such a complex issue that
 
06:15:22.670 --> 06:15:22.680 align:start position:0%
we would hope the state studies it and
 
06:15:25.190 --> 06:15:25.200 align:start position:0%
and that's why I'm here
 
06:15:27.670 --> 06:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
um I'm sure there are districts
 
06:15:28.708 --> 06:15:28.718 align:start position:0%
throughout the state that would move
 
06:15:31.548 --> 06:15:31.558 align:start position:0%
forward on this issue but given the
 
06:15:33.110 --> 06:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
conversations that I've had over the
 
06:15:36.788 --> 06:15:36.798 align:start position:0%
last year people were excited by the
 
06:15:38.948 --> 06:15:38.958 align:start position:0%
prospect of a state committee that could
 
06:15:41.230 --> 06:15:41.240 align:start position:0%
look at this issue uh and study it from
 
06:15:43.628 --> 06:15:43.638 align:start position:0%
a state perspective sort of Bird's
 
06:15:46.468 --> 06:15:46.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:48.670 --> 06:15:48.680 align:start position:0%
down representative
 
06:15:51.708 --> 06:15:51.718 align:start position:0%
McDonald thank you representative and
 
06:15:53.190 --> 06:15:53.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for bringing this forward I
 
06:15:55.270 --> 06:15:55.280 align:start position:0%
have a bit of a similar question as the
 
06:15:58.430 --> 06:15:58.440 align:start position:0%
last one that was posed um I know in
 
06:16:00.430 --> 06:16:00.440 align:start position:0%
Salem particularly our scoreboard has
 
06:16:01.990 --> 06:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
looked at doing this actually as a
 
06:16:03.708 --> 06:16:03.718 align:start position:0%
result of a student petition to look
 
06:16:06.270 --> 06:16:06.280 align:start position:0%
into it and ultimately ran into an issue
 
06:16:08.110 --> 06:16:08.120 align:start position:0%
with busing especially since we do have
 
06:16:10.468 --> 06:16:10.478 align:start position:0%
a CTE Center would make it difficult so
 
06:16:12.390 --> 06:16:12.400 align:start position:0%
when I look at lines 10 and 11 of this
 
06:16:14.350 --> 06:16:14.360 align:start position:0%
bill where it says legislation that
 
06:16:16.510 --> 06:16:16.520 align:start position:0%
would most effectively allow for changes
 
06:16:18.990 --> 06:16:19.000 align:start position:0%
to school start time I read that as if
 
06:16:20.990 --> 06:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
the goal of the committee would be to
 
06:16:22.830 --> 06:16:22.840 align:start position:0%
change school start times or encourage
 
06:16:24.910 --> 06:16:24.920 align:start position:0%
school districts to do that so is that
 
06:16:26.830 --> 06:16:26.840 align:start position:0%
your intention and what would you say to
 
06:16:28.990 --> 06:16:29.000 align:start position:0%
a district like Salem School District
 
06:16:31.150 --> 06:16:31.160 align:start position:0%
that already tried and wasn't able to do
 
06:16:33.948 --> 06:16:33.958 align:start position:0%
that well I would say local control and
 
06:16:36.190 --> 06:16:36.200 align:start position:0%
I would say what that line says the
 
06:16:37.948 --> 06:16:37.958 align:start position:0%
committee shall study what types of
 
06:16:39.910 --> 06:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
legislation would most effectively allow
 
06:16:42.468 --> 06:16:42.478 align:start position:0%
for changes to school start times I
 
06:16:44.070 --> 06:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
think that's just the charge of the
 
06:16:45.948 --> 06:16:45.958 align:start position:0%
committee and it would allow for a
 
06:16:48.750 --> 06:16:48.760 align:start position:0%
broader spectrum of let's see what Salem
 
06:16:51.070 --> 06:16:51.080 align:start position:0%
has done what Oyster River has done what
 
06:16:53.310 --> 06:16:53.320 align:start position:0%
keenh high is doing from the broader
 
06:16:55.150 --> 06:16:55.160 align:start position:0%
Statewide perspective that we have here
 
06:16:57.468 --> 06:16:57.478 align:start position:0%
in the Legislative Office Building to
 
06:17:00.510 --> 06:17:00.520 align:start position:0%
look at and come up with a potential
 
06:17:02.230 --> 06:17:02.240 align:start position:0%
solution this is a study committee so
 
06:17:04.468 --> 06:17:04.478 align:start position:0%
we'll even if there was a solution that
 
06:17:06.350 --> 06:17:06.360 align:start position:0%
came of the study committee it would
 
06:17:08.150 --> 06:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
still have to come back to the
 
06:17:11.150 --> 06:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
legislature for approval um so this is
 
06:17:14.270 --> 06:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
just to give their an official committee
 
06:17:15.708 --> 06:17:15.718 align:start position:0%
that can look at this from a bird's eye
 
06:17:17.468 --> 06:17:17.478 align:start position:0%
view and take the information learned
 
06:17:19.390 --> 06:17:19.400 align:start position:0%
from what Salem has gone through what
 
06:17:20.868 --> 06:17:20.878 align:start position:0%
Oyster River has gone through and the
 
06:17:22.510 --> 06:17:22.520 align:start position:0%
other school districts to see if there
 
06:17:25.070 --> 06:17:25.080 align:start position:0%
is some kind of through line that can be
 
06:17:26.948 --> 06:17:26.958 align:start position:0%
found through what the different school
 
06:17:28.670 --> 06:17:28.680 align:start position:0%
districts throughout the state have done
 
06:17:31.110 --> 06:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
and if I may have a followup um you
 
06:17:32.310 --> 06:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned that it might take into
 
06:17:34.030 --> 06:17:34.040 align:start position:0%
consideration what happened in Salem OR
 
06:17:36.430 --> 06:17:36.440 align:start position:0%
in Durham it sounds like would there be
 
06:17:39.070 --> 06:17:39.080 align:start position:0%
an um initiative to invite perhaps a
 
06:17:40.750 --> 06:17:40.760 align:start position:0%
member of the Salem school board or
 
06:17:42.270 --> 06:17:42.280 align:start position:0%
someone else throughout the state to
 
06:17:44.510 --> 06:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
come and speak to the committee every
 
06:17:45.990 --> 06:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
study committee that I've been on and
 
06:17:47.110 --> 06:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
I've been
 
06:17:51.390 --> 06:17:51.400 align:start position:0%
on two or three maybe four have been
 
06:17:54.070 --> 06:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
very productive and those committees
 
06:17:55.788 --> 06:17:55.798 align:start position:0%
without having to be commissions that
 
06:17:57.990 --> 06:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
say within the legislation these are the
 
06:18:00.110 --> 06:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
members outlined one member from each
 
06:18:01.948 --> 06:18:01.958 align:start position:0%
School District throughout the state
 
06:18:04.190 --> 06:18:04.200 align:start position:0%
have been able to bring people from each
 
06:18:06.628 --> 06:18:06.638 align:start position:0%
district all the uh example of the
 
06:18:08.548 --> 06:18:08.558 align:start position:0%
parole study committee that I was on two
 
06:18:12.150 --> 06:18:12.160 align:start position:0%
years ago uh and I guess was approved
 
06:18:13.390 --> 06:18:13.400 align:start position:0%
again we'll see what that looks like in
 
06:18:16.150 --> 06:18:16.160 align:start position:0%
this next legislative session but we
 
06:18:17.990 --> 06:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
were able to despite being a legislative
 
06:18:20.270 --> 06:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
study committee comprised of members of
 
06:18:22.670 --> 06:18:22.680 align:start position:0%
the house and the Senate bring in people
 
06:18:24.350 --> 06:18:24.360 align:start position:0%
and people were excited to come in and
 
06:18:27.150 --> 06:18:27.160 align:start position:0%
tell us about uh what was going on in
 
06:18:29.390 --> 06:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
the parole system and I'm people on that
 
06:18:31.230 --> 06:18:31.240 align:start position:0%
committee had very different ideas as to
 
06:18:33.030 --> 06:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
what the solution that we would come out
 
06:18:36.430 --> 06:18:36.440 align:start position:0%
of that committee was with um but it was
 
06:18:38.270 --> 06:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
just an opportunity for people to say
 
06:18:40.390 --> 06:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
there's this study committee here we can
 
06:18:43.750 --> 06:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
go to the L and and share our story and
 
06:18:45.990 --> 06:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
um I would imagine that this would be
 
06:18:47.948 --> 06:18:47.958 align:start position:0%
the fourth or fifth committee that I'd
 
06:18:49.750 --> 06:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
get to serve on which would be as
 
06:18:52.030 --> 06:18:52.040 align:start position:0%
productive uh and would bring people
 
06:18:54.350 --> 06:18:54.360 align:start position:0%
from all 89 school districts together
 
06:18:56.468 --> 06:18:56.478 align:start position:0%
all uh people from the School Board
 
06:18:59.990 --> 06:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
Association uh and others to discuss
 
06:19:02.310 --> 06:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
this issue moving forward okay thank you
 
06:19:05.110 --> 06:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:19:07.830 --> 06:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
representative wuk thank you madam Ain
 
06:19:10.788 --> 06:19:10.798 align:start position:0%
share appreciate it I want to follow up
 
06:19:13.868 --> 06:19:13.878 align:start position:0%
on R McDonald and down here as well the
 
06:19:15.708 --> 06:19:15.718 align:start position:0%
same the same essence of the question
 
06:19:19.430 --> 06:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
but is it your thinking then that the
 
06:19:22.310 --> 06:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
commission be able to provide a a uh at
 
06:19:24.868 --> 06:19:24.878 align:start position:0%
the end a summary of data and data
 
06:19:26.708 --> 06:19:26.718 align:start position:0%
points for these schools to take or is
 
06:19:28.350 --> 06:19:28.360 align:start position:0%
it your opinion that you think the next
 
06:19:29.990 --> 06:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
step is that the state is going to say
 
06:19:31.830 --> 06:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
we've seen these data points okay and
 
06:19:34.750 --> 06:19:34.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to tell you to do this
 
06:19:36.430 --> 06:19:36.440 align:start position:0%
I don't think that's for me to say I
 
06:19:37.948 --> 06:19:37.958 align:start position:0%
think it would be for the appointed
 
06:19:40.910 --> 06:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
chair of the study committee to study
 
06:19:43.030 --> 06:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
this issue and come up with a report at
 
06:19:45.270 --> 06:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
the end as study legislative study
 
06:19:48.230 --> 06:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
committees are commissioned to do uh
 
06:19:50.230 --> 06:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
what the content of that report would be
 
06:19:52.430 --> 06:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
would be up to the chair my idea would
 
06:19:55.390 --> 06:19:55.400 align:start position:0%
be to as a said to representative
 
06:19:57.590 --> 06:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
McDonald come up with a comprehensive
 
06:19:58.990 --> 06:19:59.000 align:start position:0%
approach to look at what school
 
06:20:01.190 --> 06:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
districts across the state have done to
 
06:20:03.230 --> 06:20:03.240 align:start position:0%
come up with a potential through line to
 
06:20:05.468 --> 06:20:05.478 align:start position:0%
make sure that our students can wake up
 
06:20:07.430 --> 06:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh healthier and happier and learn in
 
06:20:09.430 --> 06:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
the public schools thank you thank you
 
06:20:11.670 --> 06:20:11.680 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank
 
06:20:15.788 --> 06:20:15.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:20.270 --> 06:20:20.280 align:start position:0%
Terry um I I have read rather um
 
06:20:23.190 --> 06:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
extensively if not intensively on this
 
06:20:23.200 --> 06:20:24.390 align:start position:0%
extensively if not intensively on this
particular

06:20:24.390 --> 06:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
particular
 
06:20:28.868 --> 06:20:28.878 align:start position:0%
issue um but and so I and I'm aware that
 
06:20:31.230 --> 06:20:31.240 align:start position:0%
other states have actually initiated
 
06:20:33.590 --> 06:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
study commissions with respect to the
 
06:20:35.468 --> 06:20:35.478 align:start position:0%
issues involved
 
06:20:38.270 --> 06:20:38.280 align:start position:0%
relative to uh what what is what's the
 
06:20:41.628 --> 06:20:41.638 align:start position:0%
best time for a school to start for uh
 
06:20:44.788 --> 06:20:44.798 align:start position:0%
children of particular ages as I read
 
06:20:49.510 --> 06:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
the the line 10 three duties um it
 
06:20:52.468 --> 06:20:52.478 align:start position:0%
appears to me is that the charge to the
 
06:20:54.430 --> 06:20:54.440 align:start position:0%
committee is to
 
06:20:57.548 --> 06:20:57.558 align:start position:0%
just study what types of legislation
 
06:20:59.750 --> 06:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
would most effectively allow for changes
 
06:21:01.390 --> 06:21:01.400 align:start position:0%
to school start
 
06:21:05.190 --> 06:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
times and and it presupposes their for
 
06:21:09.910 --> 06:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
that there should be changes or are are
 
06:21:12.270 --> 06:21:12.280 align:start position:0%
are are you looking for any kind of
 
06:21:16.110 --> 06:21:16.120 align:start position:0%
study here would it be done by the state
 
06:21:19.948 --> 06:21:19.958 align:start position:0%
or by a special study committee or are
 
06:21:24.190 --> 06:21:24.200 align:start position:0%
you seeking to empower local communities
 
06:21:26.190 --> 06:21:26.200 align:start position:0%
and school boards to undertake these
 
06:21:28.390 --> 06:21:28.400 align:start position:0%
studies prior to however they would
 
06:21:31.628 --> 06:21:31.638 align:start position:0%
choose to do so if they choose to do so
 
06:21:33.830 --> 06:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
I I'm I'm just I'm a little foggy on
 
06:21:35.868 --> 06:21:35.878 align:start position:0%
this well representative Terry I was
 
06:21:37.190 --> 06:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
afraid you were going to ask a question
 
06:21:38.708 --> 06:21:38.718 align:start position:0%
because I haven't read profiles en
 
06:21:41.390 --> 06:21:41.400 align:start position:0%
courage yet but soon enough soon enough
 
06:21:43.390 --> 06:21:43.400 align:start position:0%
I will read the book that you were so
 
06:21:44.990 --> 06:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
generous to give to me last year and I'm
 
06:21:48.110 --> 06:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
looking forward to it but to answer your
 
06:21:50.750 --> 06:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
question this would be a study committee
 
06:21:52.788 --> 06:21:52.798 align:start position:0%
around the issue and I would hope that
 
06:21:54.230 --> 06:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
at the end of it as somebody who
 
06:21:57.430 --> 06:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
believes in moving forward with starting
 
06:21:59.948 --> 06:21:59.958 align:start position:0%
school later that it would help in
 
06:22:02.750 --> 06:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
compiling data to potentially come up
 
06:22:06.628 --> 06:22:06.638 align:start position:0%
with a solution in a separate bium that
 
06:22:09.150 --> 06:22:09.160 align:start position:0%
could be worked on from this committee
 
06:22:10.990 --> 06:22:11.000 align:start position:0%
and from the legislature that would
 
06:22:14.628 --> 06:22:14.638 align:start position:0%
address the issue but the matter at hand
 
06:22:16.670 --> 06:22:16.680 align:start position:0%
with the study committee itself is just
 
06:22:19.670 --> 06:22:19.680 align:start position:0%
to compile that data and to look at what
 
06:22:22.788 --> 06:22:22.798 align:start position:0%
the potential is here for a through line
 
06:22:24.548 --> 06:22:24.558 align:start position:0%
in starting school later in the state of
 
06:22:28.350 --> 06:22:28.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and maybe uh if I could
 
06:22:30.948 --> 06:22:30.958 align:start position:0%
just maybe the solution that the study
 
06:22:33.510 --> 06:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
committee finds is that there isn't one
 
06:22:35.030 --> 06:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
and that local control is the only way
 
06:22:36.628 --> 06:22:36.638 align:start position:0%
to move forward but as as you said there
 
06:22:38.150 --> 06:22:38.160 align:start position:0%
were other states that started with a
 
06:22:40.390 --> 06:22:40.400 align:start position:0%
study committee and were able to despite
 
06:22:42.708 --> 06:22:42.718 align:start position:0%
the complexities find Solutions so I
 
06:22:44.788 --> 06:22:44.798 align:start position:0%
think this is to me just a step forward
 
06:22:48.948 --> 06:22:48.958 align:start position:0%
to see what other potentials are
 
06:22:53.230 --> 06:22:53.240 align:start position:0%
there so would you be open to uh
 
06:22:55.270 --> 06:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
language that would be would give
 
06:22:59.468 --> 06:22:59.478 align:start position:0%
greater specif specificity to the the
 
06:23:03.350 --> 06:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
target to actually uh study the issue
 
06:23:05.350 --> 06:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
itself rather than just The Changing
 
06:23:07.270 --> 06:23:07.280 align:start position:0%
Times which would be the outcome
 
06:23:09.670 --> 06:23:09.680 align:start position:0%
potential outcome of recommendations of
 
06:23:12.190 --> 06:23:12.200 align:start position:0%
such a study would you be open to
 
06:23:14.390 --> 06:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
language that would effectively broaden
 
06:23:15.910 --> 06:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
this and
 
06:23:17.830 --> 06:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
clarify or do you think it's not
 
06:23:20.030 --> 06:23:20.040 align:start position:0%
necessary it's not my bill anymore it's
 
06:23:22.110 --> 06:23:22.120 align:start position:0%
yours so I would be open to whatever
 
06:23:24.270 --> 06:23:24.280 align:start position:0%
change the house education policy and
 
06:23:26.350 --> 06:23:26.360 align:start position:0%
administration to achieve your objective
 
06:23:29.990 --> 06:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
to achieve the objective of uh organized
 
06:23:32.868 --> 06:23:32.878 align:start position:0%
coherent study and approach to looking
 
06:23:34.110 --> 06:23:34.120 align:start position:0%
at where that through line could be
 
06:23:36.350 --> 06:23:36.360 align:start position:0%
found to start school later thank you
 
06:23:36.360 --> 06:23:38.030 align:start position:0%
found to start school later thank you
thank

06:23:38.030 --> 06:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
thank
 
06:23:40.310 --> 06:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
you any other
 
06:23:44.430 --> 06:23:44.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:49.548 --> 06:23:49.558 align:start position:0%
moris hi um thank you Vice chair Madam
 
06:23:51.110 --> 06:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
chair thank I'm still learning all the
 
06:23:53.948 --> 06:23:53.958 align:start position:0%
terminology it's my first term here so
 
06:23:56.390 --> 06:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
um it is my understanding that by the
 
06:23:58.190 --> 06:23:58.200 align:start position:0%
potential later star times would also
 
06:24:00.230 --> 06:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
equate to a later end time in schools
 
06:24:02.468 --> 06:24:02.478 align:start position:0%
which could possibly save parents money
 
06:24:04.948 --> 06:24:04.958 align:start position:0%
in After School Care thank you that is
 
06:24:06.708 --> 06:24:06.718 align:start position:0%
correct representative Morris there are
 
06:24:08.548 --> 06:24:08.558 align:start position:0%
some benefits despite the complex
 
06:24:10.548 --> 06:24:10.558 align:start position:0%
negatives that are here when it comes to
 
06:24:12.830 --> 06:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
busing Etc there are some absolute
 
06:24:15.310 --> 06:24:15.320 align:start position:0%
positives to this um not just the health
 
06:24:18.270 --> 06:24:18.280 align:start position:0%
of the students but yeah we could reduce
 
06:24:21.628 --> 06:24:21.638 align:start position:0%
child care costs if school started later
 
06:24:23.230 --> 06:24:23.240 align:start position:0%
um and I would have to say you know even
 
06:24:25.510 --> 06:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
with the busing situation I mean the
 
06:24:27.628 --> 06:24:27.638 align:start position:0%
busing company shouldn't determine what
 
06:24:29.948 --> 06:24:29.958 align:start position:0%
the schedule of our students in the
 
06:24:31.788 --> 06:24:31.798 align:start position:0%
public schools are so whatever is best
 
06:24:33.708 --> 06:24:33.718 align:start position:0%
for the busing company might not be best
 
06:24:35.708 --> 06:24:35.718 align:start position:0%
for the student and and so I would hope
 
06:24:37.030 --> 06:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
we could look at that issue with the
 
06:24:39.310 --> 06:24:39.320 align:start position:0%
busing companies coming here the school
 
06:24:42.350 --> 06:24:42.360 align:start position:0%
boards coming here and and and all the
 
06:24:44.830 --> 06:24:44.840 align:start position:0%
uh people who are involved coming here
 
06:24:46.990 --> 06:24:47.000 align:start position:0%
and talking about just those issues
 
06:24:47.990 --> 06:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
sounds like you want to be on the
 
06:24:51.628 --> 06:24:51.638 align:start position:0%
committee thank you and maybe I don't
 
06:24:54.150 --> 06:24:54.160 align:start position:0%
know any other
 
06:24:56.390 --> 06:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you
 
06:24:57.788 --> 06:24:57.798 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler thank you very
 
06:25:01.788 --> 06:25:01.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:05.990 --> 06:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
chair it's all time in this place
 
06:25:16.750 --> 06:25:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:19.670 --> 06:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
Penza thank you madam chair that's cool
 
06:25:22.468 --> 06:25:22.478 align:start position:0%
to say um my name is representative
 
06:25:24.430 --> 06:25:24.440 align:start position:0%
Kelly Penza I represent straford
 
06:25:28.510 --> 06:25:28.520 align:start position:0%
District 19 uh in Rochester um now I'm
 
06:25:32.110 --> 06:25:32.120 align:start position:0%
totally going to date myself um my
 
06:25:33.948 --> 06:25:33.958 align:start position:0%
previous life I worked in for a higher
 
06:25:33.958 --> 06:25:34.910 align:start position:0%
previous life I worked in for a higher
educ

06:25:34.910 --> 06:25:34.920 align:start position:0%
educ
 
06:25:36.590 --> 06:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
uh marketing organization before that I
 
06:25:39.910 --> 06:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
worked for Babson College and then um I
 
06:25:42.430 --> 06:25:42.440 align:start position:0%
was there uh for about 10 years in the
 
06:25:44.628 --> 06:25:44.638 align:start position:0%
space um I also did educational
 
06:25:46.628 --> 06:25:46.638 align:start position:0%
Consulting for a long time I have
 
06:25:50.590 --> 06:25:50.600 align:start position:0%
studied this issue extensively so this
 
06:25:53.868 --> 06:25:53.878 align:start position:0%
um subject really came hard-hitting in
 
06:25:56.948 --> 06:25:56.958 align:start position:0%
the 90s um I graduated from high school
 
06:25:56.958 --> 06:25:57.868 align:start position:0%
the 90s um I graduated from high school
in

06:25:57.868 --> 06:25:57.878 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:26:00.310 --> 06:26:00.320 align:start position:0%
1991 uh representative Noble knows that
 
06:26:01.948 --> 06:26:01.958 align:start position:0%
as well
 
06:26:04.990 --> 06:26:05.000 align:start position:0%
um so um
 
06:26:06.948 --> 06:26:06.958 align:start position:0%
it's been Crystal Clear unfortunately
 
06:26:09.788 --> 06:26:09.798 align:start position:0%
it's taken a very long time for all of
 
06:26:12.430 --> 06:26:12.440 align:start position:0%
these studies to come forward so this is
 
06:26:15.350 --> 06:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
a fantastic study um I would love to be
 
06:26:17.548 --> 06:26:17.558 align:start position:0%
part of this I just don't know if I have
 
06:26:20.030 --> 06:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
enough time um but I would you know be
 
06:26:23.070 --> 06:26:23.080 align:start position:0%
very happy to provide all of the
 
06:26:26.070 --> 06:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
research that's been done for decades on
 
06:26:30.190 --> 06:26:30.200 align:start position:0%
this um you know adolescence alone this
 
06:26:33.030 --> 06:26:33.040 align:start position:0%
is um they need between the ages of 13
 
06:26:35.510 --> 06:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
18 they should be sleeping between 8 to
 
06:26:38.150 --> 06:26:38.160 align:start position:0%
10 hours per day um that's according to
 
06:26:40.910 --> 06:26:40.920 align:start position:0%
every single study from American Academy
 
06:26:43.948 --> 06:26:43.958 align:start position:0%
of sleep medicine to Pediatrics to
 
06:26:47.868 --> 06:26:47.878 align:start position:0%
Psychiatry all all the gamut and um all
 
06:26:49.910 --> 06:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
the outcomes show so there like more
 
06:26:52.430 --> 06:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
than 500 different school districts
 
06:26:54.548 --> 06:26:54.558 align:start position:0%
right now in the country um that have
 
06:26:57.350 --> 06:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
done the later start times um and I love
 
06:26:59.390 --> 06:26:59.400 align:start position:0%
how the representative wheeler ended
 
06:27:01.708 --> 06:27:01.718 align:start position:0%
with about we shouldn't be having an
 
06:27:03.910 --> 06:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
outside busing company driving the
 
06:27:06.190 --> 06:27:06.200 align:start position:0%
health and well-being and the academic
 
06:27:09.708 --> 06:27:09.718 align:start position:0%
Integrity of our students um I also at
 
06:27:11.350 --> 06:27:11.360 align:start position:0%
the same time that I studied this
 
06:27:14.510 --> 06:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
subject I also studied trimesters I am
 
06:27:17.590 --> 06:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
all for it um the the learning Gap in
 
06:27:21.670 --> 06:27:21.680 align:start position:0%
the summer um is is huge uh I wanted to
 
06:27:24.110 --> 06:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
I actually uh applied to work for a
 
06:27:26.670 --> 06:27:26.680 align:start position:0%
college that was doing it it trimesters
 
06:27:29.030 --> 06:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
so it gave breaks all throughout so you
 
06:27:30.990 --> 06:27:31.000 align:start position:0%
don't have huge learning loss where
 
06:27:33.830 --> 06:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
you're spending the first you know um
 
06:27:35.788 --> 06:27:35.798 align:start position:0%
month or two of the school year having
 
06:27:38.270 --> 06:27:38.280 align:start position:0%
to have relearned everything that you
 
06:27:39.750 --> 06:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
forgot about over three months of a
 
06:27:42.190 --> 06:27:42.200 align:start position:0%
summer so it was at the same time that
 
06:27:44.548 --> 06:27:44.558 align:start position:0%
these things happened um and it's an
 
06:27:49.030 --> 06:27:49.040 align:start position:0%
easy thing really that can happen um so
 
06:27:51.230 --> 06:27:51.240 align:start position:0%
you know the studies it's an easy thing
 
06:27:52.868 --> 06:27:52.878 align:start position:0%
that that can happen like through
 
06:27:55.990 --> 06:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
legislation of course um to to fix
 
06:27:58.948 --> 06:27:58.958 align:start position:0%
something that could help um overall all
 
06:28:01.670 --> 06:28:01.680 align:start position:0%
of the uh students in our state so
 
06:28:04.750 --> 06:28:04.760 align:start position:0%
during puberty I wrote this down
 
06:28:07.270 --> 06:28:07.280 align:start position:0%
um youth have this undergo in their like
 
06:28:09.270 --> 06:28:09.280 align:start position:0%
their internal clocks so it actually
 
06:28:11.150 --> 06:28:11.160 align:start position:0%
makes them harder for them to fall
 
06:28:13.150 --> 06:28:13.160 align:start position:0%
asleep at night and all these things
 
06:28:16.190 --> 06:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
will be um discussed and then um they
 
06:28:18.788 --> 06:28:18.798 align:start position:0%
could also stay awake longer um before
 
06:28:20.830 --> 06:28:20.840 align:start position:0%
experiencing an increase in the pressure
 
06:28:22.750 --> 06:28:22.760 align:start position:0%
to sleep so there's all of these things
 
06:28:24.110 --> 06:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
that are just happening because their
 
06:28:26.788 --> 06:28:26.798 align:start position:0%
bodies are changing um and all of that
 
06:28:30.350 --> 06:28:30.360 align:start position:0%
so I remember when my girls were um in
 
06:28:33.830 --> 06:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
fifth and sixth grade um and that bus
 
06:28:36.830 --> 06:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
Ian they had to be out there um one of
 
06:28:38.150 --> 06:28:38.160 align:start position:0%
them had to be out there because it was
 
06:28:41.150 --> 06:28:41.160 align:start position:0%
two different buses 6:20 in the morning
 
06:28:43.270 --> 06:28:43.280 align:start position:0%
and I just couldn't stand that so of
 
06:28:44.788 --> 06:28:44.798 align:start position:0%
course you know I brought them to school
 
06:28:46.548 --> 06:28:46.558 align:start position:0%
just because of that and I wanted them
 
06:28:49.070 --> 06:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
to sleep in later but I I think
 
06:28:50.868 --> 06:28:50.878 align:start position:0%
everything there's so many benefits even
 
06:28:52.548 --> 06:28:52.558 align:start position:0%
with child care and all those types of
 
06:28:54.990 --> 06:28:55.000 align:start position:0%
things so I highly encourage you guys
 
06:28:56.468 --> 06:28:56.478 align:start position:0%
and I think it's a great point that you
 
06:28:58.070 --> 06:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
made representative Terry it's your bill
 
06:29:01.030 --> 06:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
now I think you can expand that line 10
 
06:29:03.270 --> 06:29:03.280 align:start position:0%
to be more inclusive so it's just just
 
06:29:06.030 --> 06:29:06.040 align:start position:0%
not focused on the legislation but uh
 
06:29:07.868 --> 06:29:07.878 align:start position:0%
you know if I have the time of
 
06:29:09.548 --> 06:29:09.558 align:start position:0%
Representative wheeler I'll I'll I'll
 
06:29:11.510 --> 06:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
join this or provide as much information
 
06:29:14.628 --> 06:29:14.638 align:start position:0%
as I can this was my wheelhouse so in
 
06:29:15.868 --> 06:29:15.878 align:start position:0%
the back in the
 
06:29:19.150 --> 06:29:19.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:25.788 --> 06:29:25.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:29.750 --> 06:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:38.350 --> 06:29:38.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:40.190 --> 06:29:40.200 align:start position:0%
is it okay if I go first because we kind
 
06:29:44.468 --> 06:29:44.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:47.670 --> 06:29:47.680 align:start position:0%
you um hi
 
06:29:49.990 --> 06:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
I'm shorter than everybody
 
06:29:53.990 --> 06:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
else hi I'm Kiara and I'm a sixth grader
 
06:29:56.070 --> 06:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
um why we shouldn't have to wake up
 
06:29:58.468 --> 06:29:58.478 align:start position:0%
early to go to school I woke up at 6:00
 
06:30:00.390 --> 06:30:00.400 align:start position:0%
in the morning last year some of my
 
06:30:02.310 --> 06:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
friends had to wake up at 4:00 because
 
06:30:04.708 --> 06:30:04.718 align:start position:0%
of the buzz schedule wake up that early
 
06:30:07.150 --> 06:30:07.160 align:start position:0%
is not healthy for developing kids we're
 
06:30:09.430 --> 06:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
supposed to get 8 to 10 hours of sleep
 
06:30:10.788 --> 06:30:10.798 align:start position:0%
and I know that most of my friends are
 
06:30:13.190 --> 06:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
getting a lot less than that since
 
06:30:14.990 --> 06:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
school starts early and kids do not
 
06:30:16.990 --> 06:30:17.000 align:start position:0%
usually wake up early that means that
 
06:30:19.230 --> 06:30:19.240 align:start position:0%
kids run late I know from experience
 
06:30:20.868 --> 06:30:20.878 align:start position:0%
that there is so much happening all at
 
06:30:23.788 --> 06:30:23.798 align:start position:0%
once and it's really chaotic when
 
06:30:25.430 --> 06:30:25.440 align:start position:0%
everything is so crazy and you're so
 
06:30:27.708 --> 06:30:27.718 align:start position:0%
stressed out it's really easy to forget
 
06:30:30.430 --> 06:30:30.440 align:start position:0%
things like instruments or homework it's
 
06:30:32.150 --> 06:30:32.160 align:start position:0%
also not safe to go to the bus stop in
 
06:30:34.350 --> 06:30:34.360 align:start position:0%
the dark one of my peers was walking to
 
06:30:36.070 --> 06:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
the bus stop in the dark and he saw a
 
06:30:38.150 --> 06:30:38.160 align:start position:0%
dog like animal he assumed it was one of
 
06:30:40.910 --> 06:30:40.920 align:start position:0%
his neighbor's dogs as he got closer he
 
06:30:44.150 --> 06:30:44.160 align:start position:0%
realized it wasn't it was a
 
06:30:47.670 --> 06:30:47.680 align:start position:0%
coyote uh sorry getting up so early
 
06:30:50.350 --> 06:30:50.360 align:start position:0%
means getting up so early that it's dark
 
06:30:53.110 --> 06:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
means that there are wild animals around
 
06:30:54.590 --> 06:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
waking up
 
06:30:57.948 --> 06:30:57.958 align:start position:0%
I last year I went to a public school
 
06:31:00.548 --> 06:31:00.558 align:start position:0%
and this year I I'm going to a private
 
06:31:03.150 --> 06:31:03.160 align:start position:0%
school um I did that because waking up
 
06:31:07.150 --> 06:31:07.160 align:start position:0%
so early took a mental toll on me um I
 
06:31:09.270 --> 06:31:09.280 align:start position:0%
woke up feeling exhausted stressed
 
06:31:12.628 --> 06:31:12.638 align:start position:0%
irritable and sad it affected my entire
 
06:31:14.788 --> 06:31:14.798 align:start position:0%
day this year I wake up feeling
 
06:31:18.670 --> 06:31:18.680 align:start position:0%
refreshed much better and I'm on
 
06:31:25.350 --> 06:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:32.150 --> 06:31:32.160 align:start position:0%
you um hi um I'm L I go to public school
 
06:31:35.310 --> 06:31:35.320 align:start position:0%
every day and me and others have to wake
 
06:31:39.948 --> 06:31:39.958 align:start position:0%
up at 6 and earlier every single day to
 
06:31:43.190 --> 06:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
go to school making them tired and
 
06:31:46.310 --> 06:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
unfocused some even sick making them
 
06:31:49.190 --> 06:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
Miss even more school than they do when
 
06:31:49.200 --> 06:31:50.190 align:start position:0%
Miss even more school than they do when
they're

06:31:50.190 --> 06:31:50.200 align:start position:0%
they're
 
06:31:50.200 --> 06:31:51.708 align:start position:0%
they're
late

06:31:51.708 --> 06:31:51.718 align:start position:0%
late
 
06:31:56.548 --> 06:31:56.558 align:start position:0%
also the time we go to get to the bus or
 
06:31:59.948 --> 06:31:59.958 align:start position:0%
walk or drive is so early that it's
 
06:32:02.708 --> 06:32:02.718 align:start position:0%
still dark outside making it hard to see
 
06:32:04.708 --> 06:32:04.718 align:start position:0%
creating many problems
 
06:32:10.468 --> 06:32:10.478 align:start position:0%
such as like cars on like busy
 
06:32:13.350 --> 06:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
intersections ice and
 
06:32:16.868 --> 06:32:16.878 align:start position:0%
animals another problem with waking up
 
06:32:20.350 --> 06:32:20.360 align:start position:0%
early is that it makes people sleep in
 
06:32:21.868 --> 06:32:21.878 align:start position:0%
and forget stuff they would normally
 
06:32:24.750 --> 06:32:24.760 align:start position:0%
know like setting alarms making parents
 
06:32:26.990 --> 06:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
late to jobs because they have to drive
 
06:32:27.000 --> 06:32:28.548 align:start position:0%
late to jobs because they have to drive
their

06:32:28.548 --> 06:32:28.558 align:start position:0%
their
 
06:32:34.350 --> 06:32:34.360 align:start position:0%
kids um let me just get over here
 
06:32:37.270 --> 06:32:37.280 align:start position:0%
um this also affects the teachers
 
06:32:40.990 --> 06:32:41.000 align:start position:0%
because they have to um wake up earlier
 
06:32:44.510 --> 06:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
than the students to go to school to
 
06:32:44.520 --> 06:32:46.070 align:start position:0%
than the students to go to school to
teach

06:32:46.070 --> 06:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
teach
 
06:32:50.510 --> 06:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
them um what do you think where's my
 
06:32:55.310 --> 06:32:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:06.110 --> 06:33:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:06.120 --> 06:33:08.150 align:start position:0%
 
hi

06:33:08.150 --> 06:33:08.160 align:start position:0%
hi
 
06:33:11.190 --> 06:33:11.200 align:start position:0%
I'm hi I'm Siara and I'm a sixth grader
 
06:33:13.868 --> 06:33:13.878 align:start position:0%
at sou medal
 
06:33:16.270 --> 06:33:16.280 align:start position:0%
school kids at my school usually get
 
06:33:18.110 --> 06:33:18.120 align:start position:0%
about 5 to 6 hours when they should get
 
06:33:20.990 --> 06:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
8 to 10 and if I don't get enough sleep
 
06:33:22.510 --> 06:33:22.520 align:start position:0%
I don't feel good and end up missing
 
06:33:24.708 --> 06:33:24.718 align:start position:0%
more school days it's also harder to
 
06:33:27.430 --> 06:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
focus without much sleep teachers could
 
06:33:28.990 --> 06:33:29.000 align:start position:0%
also benefit from getting up later cuz
 
06:33:30.430 --> 06:33:30.440 align:start position:0%
they have to get up even earlier than
 
06:33:30.440 --> 06:33:34.948 align:start position:0%
they have to get up even earlier than
students

06:33:34.948 --> 06:33:34.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:37.510 --> 06:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
teachers don't or kids don't have time
 
06:33:39.670 --> 06:33:39.680 align:start position:0%
to eat breakfast in the morning if they
 
06:33:42.030 --> 06:33:42.040 align:start position:0%
get up super early and have to rush the
 
06:33:44.468 --> 06:33:44.478 align:start position:0%
bus sometimes kids put their heads down
 
06:33:46.788 --> 06:33:46.798 align:start position:0%
on desks CU they don't have enough sleep
 
06:33:48.270 --> 06:33:48.280 align:start position:0%
and then they get yelled at by teachers
 
06:33:49.510 --> 06:33:49.520 align:start position:0%
and sometimes even sent to the
 
06:33:53.230 --> 06:33:53.240 align:start position:0%
principal's office also cuz it's so dark
 
06:33:55.628 --> 06:33:55.638 align:start position:0%
most kids have to go to the bus at in
 
06:33:57.070 --> 06:33:57.080 align:start position:0%
the dark and it's so much colder at
 
06:33:59.868 --> 06:33:59.878 align:start position:0%
night without the sun in the winter I've
 
06:34:02.868 --> 06:34:02.878 align:start position:0%
been feeling sick like stomach aches
 
06:34:05.430 --> 06:34:05.440 align:start position:0%
headaches Js Etc ever since I started
 
06:34:10.430 --> 06:34:10.440 align:start position:0%

early thank you very much would you

experiences um I'm a minister and one of
 
06:34:33.468 --> 06:34:33.478 align:start position:0%
my favorite Bible verses is don't let
 
06:34:35.948 --> 06:34:35.958 align:start position:0%
the World squeeze you into its mold it
 
06:34:37.628 --> 06:34:37.638 align:start position:0%
sounds to me like what I'm hearing from
 
06:34:40.310 --> 06:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
you is that you guys are being squeezed
 
06:34:43.270 --> 06:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
into adults mold and it's not working
 
06:34:45.750 --> 06:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
out very well for you by your opinion
 
06:34:48.670 --> 06:34:48.680 align:start position:0%
and your experiences if that's the case
 
06:34:50.468 --> 06:34:50.478 align:start position:0%
what time do you think would be a good
 
06:34:53.468 --> 06:34:53.478 align:start position:0%
time for school to start so that you
 
06:34:55.590 --> 06:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
would be better off in the teachers too
 
06:34:57.628 --> 06:34:57.638 align:start position:0%
do you have opinions
 
06:35:01.190 --> 06:35:01.200 align:start position:0%

06:35:24.830 --> 06:35:24.840 align:start position:0%
you girls are from uh pet pet pet yeah
 
06:35:27.788 --> 06:35:27.798 align:start position:0%
yeah okay representative Cel thank you
 
06:35:29.708 --> 06:35:29.718 align:start position:0%
so much so I I want to thank you first
 
06:35:31.548 --> 06:35:31.558 align:start position:0%
of all for your thoughtful testimony
 
06:35:32.948 --> 06:35:32.958 align:start position:0%
also for remembering that teachers have
 
06:35:34.948 --> 06:35:34.958 align:start position:0%
to get up even earlier to be there to
 
06:35:36.990 --> 06:35:37.000 align:start position:0%
prepare for you as a a former teacher in
 
06:35:38.750 --> 06:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
a school district that um started at
 
06:35:41.150 --> 06:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
7:00 a.m. I had to wake up at 5: to be
 
06:35:43.948 --> 06:35:43.958 align:start position:0%
on time myself so I can relate to that
 
06:35:46.150 --> 06:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
um my question and it may not be as
 
06:35:47.670 --> 06:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
relevant because I think you're all in
 
06:35:50.190 --> 06:35:50.200 align:start position:0%
Middle School still at the stage is
 
06:35:51.548 --> 06:35:51.558 align:start position:0%
whether or not any of you participate in
 
06:35:54.788 --> 06:35:54.798 align:start position:0%
after school sports and have the had the
 
06:35:57.628 --> 06:35:57.638 align:start position:0%
impact of that the time scheduling the
 
06:35:59.388 --> 06:35:59.398 align:start position:0%
timing around that with your schools at
 
06:36:10.430 --> 06:36:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:13.670 --> 06:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
um I don't really know the
 
06:36:15.910 --> 06:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
answer representative
 
06:36:19.548 --> 06:36:19.558 align:start position:0%
hul thank you madam chair and thank you
 
06:36:21.430 --> 06:36:21.440 align:start position:0%
for coming here today to speak to us
 
06:36:23.510 --> 06:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
it's been awesome my question is for the
 
06:36:25.510 --> 06:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
one in the middle you said school starts
 
06:36:28.910 --> 06:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
at 9:00 a.m. what time does it end
 
06:36:33.030 --> 06:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
um it like we leave pickup is at 3:30 so
 
06:36:36.590 --> 06:36:36.600 align:start position:0%
we kind of I get back at four um yeah
 
06:36:38.750 --> 06:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
06:36:40.788 --> 06:36:40.798 align:start position:0%
you any other
 
06:36:43.190 --> 06:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
questions or of
 
06:36:46.110 --> 06:36:46.120 align:start position:0%
Litchfield thank you madam chair and
 
06:36:47.868 --> 06:36:47.878 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question and
 
06:36:49.830 --> 06:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for getting up here to
 
06:36:52.310 --> 06:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
speak today you are all phenomenal each
 
06:36:55.110 --> 06:36:55.120 align:start position:0%
and every one of you so thank you my
 
06:36:57.830 --> 06:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
question is when we're looking at this
 
06:36:59.388 --> 06:36:59.398 align:start position:0%
probably we're going to have to share
 
06:37:02.150 --> 06:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
the school bus grades kindergarten
 
06:37:04.590 --> 06:37:04.600 align:start position:0%
through 12th grader maybe 10th right I
 
06:37:05.948 --> 06:37:05.958 align:start position:0%
don't want to exaggerate maybe get your
 
06:37:09.430 --> 06:37:09.440 align:start position:0%
license when you're 16 you can drive how
 
06:37:11.270 --> 06:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
do you feel about that do you think it's
 
06:37:13.990 --> 06:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
okay do are you okay with having the big
 
06:37:15.708 --> 06:37:15.718 align:start position:0%
kids and the really little kids on the
 
06:37:18.310 --> 06:37:18.320 align:start position:0%
bus or the crazy middle schoolers what
 
06:37:23.070 --> 06:37:23.080 align:start position:0%
do you think about that um I think that
 
06:37:25.230 --> 06:37:25.240 align:start position:0%
if people can be
 
06:37:28.110 --> 06:37:28.120 align:start position:0%
civilized unlike some people that I know
 
06:37:30.230 --> 06:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
um I think that it would work out and I
 
06:37:32.510 --> 06:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
think something that's helpful is having
 
06:37:34.388 --> 06:37:34.398 align:start position:0%
the younger kids sit in the front which
 
06:37:36.388 --> 06:37:36.398 align:start position:0%
is like what we did in elementary school
 
06:37:38.430 --> 06:37:38.440 align:start position:0%
the fourth graders would sit in the back
 
06:37:40.070 --> 06:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
and I think if the high schoolers were
 
06:37:41.788 --> 06:37:41.798 align:start position:0%
to sit in the back they would still be
 
06:37:45.150 --> 06:37:45.160 align:start position:0%
some separation but I think it would be
 
06:37:47.510 --> 06:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
okay you guys
 
06:37:52.388 --> 06:37:52.398 align:start position:0%
um uh um personally I think it would be
 
06:37:56.310 --> 06:37:56.320 align:start position:0%
pretty good because on my bus we have
 
06:37:58.388 --> 06:37:58.398 align:start position:0%
our grade and like all the middle
 
06:38:00.708 --> 06:38:00.718 align:start position:0%
schoolers and the high schoolers and
 
06:38:02.708 --> 06:38:02.718 align:start position:0%
they don't really normally cause any
 
06:38:06.910 --> 06:38:06.920 align:start position:0%
problems so I would say it's pretty good
 
06:38:08.788 --> 06:38:08.798 align:start position:0%
like that if there were like clear
 
06:38:11.150 --> 06:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
separations between like elementary
 
06:38:12.350 --> 06:38:12.360 align:start position:0%
school and middle school and high school
 
06:38:17.030 --> 06:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:19.990 --> 06:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
fine representative McDonald thank you
 
06:38:23.430 --> 06:38:23.440 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you Kier L and
 
06:38:25.788 --> 06:38:25.798 align:start position:0%
Sierra that was really good testimony
 
06:38:27.830 --> 06:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
it's always nice to see you come we
 
06:38:29.830 --> 06:38:29.840 align:start position:0%
don't often hear the student perspective
 
06:38:31.388 --> 06:38:31.398 align:start position:0%
but probably in this committee more than
 
06:38:34.350 --> 06:38:34.360 align:start position:0%
others um my question pertains to your
 
06:38:36.468 --> 06:38:36.478 align:start position:0%
homework after school if school ends a
 
06:38:38.150 --> 06:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
little bit later would you still feel
 
06:38:39.310 --> 06:38:39.320 align:start position:0%
like you have enough time to complete
 
06:38:41.548 --> 06:38:41.558 align:start position:0%
your homework before going to bed I mean
 
06:38:44.510 --> 06:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
me and L we don't have like that much
 
06:38:47.310 --> 06:38:47.320 align:start position:0%
homework so I think we'd be
 
06:38:51.510 --> 06:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
fine sounds pretty lucky um I I go to a
 
06:38:53.910 --> 06:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
private school so we have a a lot a lot
 
06:38:57.030 --> 06:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
a lot a lot of homework and like a lot
 
06:38:58.430 --> 06:38:58.440 align:start position:0%
like we have to do a journal entry we
 
06:39:00.110 --> 06:39:00.120 align:start position:0%
have to memorize this thing and say it
 
06:39:02.628 --> 06:39:02.638 align:start position:0%
in front of the entire school do math we
 
06:39:06.110 --> 06:39:06.120 align:start position:0%
have like art homework but we I most all
 
06:39:08.708 --> 06:39:08.718 align:start position:0%
of my classmates get all of it done from
 
06:39:10.468 --> 06:39:10.478 align:start position:0%
the time that we get home and the time
 
06:39:14.270 --> 06:39:14.280 align:start position:0%
that we have so and I think that we do
 
06:39:16.070 --> 06:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
it fine so
 
06:39:17.990 --> 06:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
yeah thank
 
06:39:20.150 --> 06:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
you any other
 
06:39:23.388 --> 06:39:23.398 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you girls
 
06:39:26.350 --> 06:39:26.360 align:start position:0%
very big help thank you thank you thank
 
06:39:26.360 --> 06:39:31.500 align:start position:0%
very big help thank you thank you thank
you

06:39:31.500 --> 06:39:31.510 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:31.510 --> 06:39:34.430 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

06:39:34.430 --> 06:39:34.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:39:35.468 --> 06:39:35.478 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I'm reading this
 
06:39:43.750 --> 06:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:45.990 --> 06:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
Tucker um I'd like to start with
 
06:39:48.230 --> 06:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
gratitude that we're not starting at 7
 
06:39:52.948 --> 06:39:52.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:55.468 --> 06:39:55.478 align:start position:0%
that um so I'm the parent of a sixth
 
06:39:57.868 --> 06:39:57.878 align:start position:0%
grader Kiara and I'm also a
 
06:40:00.310 --> 06:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
psychotherapist and a Community member
 
06:40:03.310 --> 06:40:03.320 align:start position:0%
and in all of these roles is this an
 
06:40:06.030 --> 06:40:06.040 align:start position:0%
close enough okay in all of these roles
 
06:40:08.670 --> 06:40:08.680 align:start position:0%
I see the impact of early school start
 
06:40:11.548 --> 06:40:11.558 align:start position:0%
times um we haven't heard too much about
 
06:40:13.750 --> 06:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
the research except that it exists but
 
06:40:16.670 --> 06:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
it is more and better quality sleep B
 
06:40:18.708 --> 06:40:18.718 align:start position:0%
better mental and physical health
 
06:40:21.708 --> 06:40:21.718 align:start position:0%
improved academic outcomes reduced risk
 
06:40:24.468 --> 06:40:24.478 align:start position:0%
of car accidents and injuries improved
 
06:40:27.270 --> 06:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
athletic performance fewer late arrivals
 
06:40:27.280 --> 06:40:28.150 align:start position:0%
athletic performance fewer late arrivals
and

06:40:28.150 --> 06:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:40:30.750 --> 06:40:30.760 align:start position:0%
absences so we know that human beings
 
06:40:34.110 --> 06:40:34.120 align:start position:0%
biological biological clocks naturally
 
06:40:37.548 --> 06:40:37.558 align:start position:0%
lengthen each day it makes it hard to go
 
06:40:39.910 --> 06:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
to sleep earlier the average human's
 
06:40:43.070 --> 06:40:43.080 align:start position:0%
natural day length is 24.2
 
06:40:46.110 --> 06:40:46.120 align:start position:0%
hours humans volunteered to spend months
 
06:40:48.070 --> 06:40:48.080 align:start position:0%
in the dark to increase our
 
06:40:50.150 --> 06:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
understanding of biorhythms and the
 
06:40:52.708 --> 06:40:52.718 align:start position:0%
outcome was that humans days naturally
 
06:40:55.750 --> 06:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
got longer and longer if you've ever
 
06:40:59.230 --> 06:40:59.240 align:start position:0%
traveled East and experience jet leg you
 
06:41:02.230 --> 06:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
know that that is much harder to shorten
 
06:41:04.868 --> 06:41:04.878 align:start position:0%
your day and go to bed earlier it's much
 
06:41:08.150 --> 06:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
easier to travel West and stay up later
 
06:41:10.670 --> 06:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
the situation is only more extreme for
 
06:41:13.310 --> 06:41:13.320 align:start position:0%
our youth right when middle schoolers
 
06:41:15.788 --> 06:41:15.798 align:start position:0%
and high schoolers bodies are changing
 
06:41:17.030 --> 06:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
due to
 
06:41:19.910 --> 06:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
hormones their circadian rhythms shift
 
06:41:22.270 --> 06:41:22.280 align:start position:0%
so that it's even harder for them to go
 
06:41:24.388 --> 06:41:24.398 align:start position:0%
to sleep earlier so right then we're
 
06:41:26.628 --> 06:41:26.638 align:start position:0%
suddenly asking them to wake up earlier
 
06:41:29.150 --> 06:41:29.160 align:start position:0%
go against their biology there's a
 
06:41:31.230 --> 06:41:31.240 align:start position:0%
reason that sleep deprivation is a
 
06:41:35.030 --> 06:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
torture tactic it is is
 
06:41:37.788 --> 06:41:37.798 align:start position:0%
torturous and it impacts everything when
 
06:41:41.190 --> 06:41:41.200 align:start position:0%
we don't get enough sleep so listen
 
06:41:44.548 --> 06:41:44.558 align:start position:0%
change can be hard and we humans often
 
06:41:47.468 --> 06:41:47.478 align:start position:0%
fear it maybe even more than I Fear
 
06:41:50.388 --> 06:41:50.398 align:start position:0%
public speaking notice my shaking
 
06:41:53.468 --> 06:41:53.478 align:start position:0%
hands but once we adjust to change it
 
06:41:55.948 --> 06:41:55.958 align:start position:0%
can really be a relief and I'm talking
 
06:41:57.990 --> 06:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
about relief for the high schooler
 
06:42:00.628 --> 06:42:00.638 align:start position:0%
working at CVS who told me that she only
 
06:42:02.708 --> 06:42:02.718 align:start position:0%
gets four hours of sleep a night by the
 
06:42:04.750 --> 06:42:04.760 align:start position:0%
time she finishes work and finishes her
 
06:42:07.788 --> 06:42:07.798 align:start position:0%
homework and is able to wind down and go
 
06:42:10.190 --> 06:42:10.200 align:start position:0%
to sleep and I'm talking about relief
 
06:42:12.868 --> 06:42:12.878 align:start position:0%
for the students I know who have trouble
 
06:42:14.788 --> 06:42:14.798 align:start position:0%
winding down and falling asleep even if
 
06:42:16.388 --> 06:42:16.398 align:start position:0%
they don't have
 
06:42:18.990 --> 06:42:19.000 align:start position:0%
jobs and then they fall asleep on the
 
06:42:21.910 --> 06:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
bus and in class and I'm talking about
 
06:42:24.628 --> 06:42:24.638 align:start position:0%
relief for a kid who I know who showered
 
06:42:27.270 --> 06:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
and got dressed at night to be ready for
 
06:42:29.110 --> 06:42:29.120 align:start position:0%
the early start in the morning already
 
06:42:31.388 --> 06:42:31.398 align:start position:0%
in their clothes when they wake up but
 
06:42:33.830 --> 06:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
they go in the morning to get their
 
06:42:35.910 --> 06:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
socks out accidentally pull out their
 
06:42:37.948 --> 06:42:37.958 align:start position:0%
underwear don't even realize what's
 
06:42:39.990 --> 06:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
happening until they look down they put
 
06:42:42.628 --> 06:42:42.638 align:start position:0%
underwear on over their clothes this is
 
06:42:46.110 --> 06:42:46.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:48.350 --> 06:42:48.360 align:start position:0%
are I'm almost
 
06:42:51.948 --> 06:42:51.958 align:start position:0%
done um I also know really personally
 
06:42:54.590 --> 06:42:54.600 align:start position:0%
the relief that I'm talking about after
 
06:42:56.708 --> 06:42:56.718 align:start position:0%
a really rough transition to middle
 
06:42:59.948 --> 06:42:59.958 align:start position:0%
school with daily bedtime and wakeup
 
06:43:02.230 --> 06:43:02.240 align:start position:0%
struggles that really impacted the
 
06:43:04.548 --> 06:43:04.558 align:start position:0%
well-being of my kid we moved to a
 
06:43:06.948 --> 06:43:06.958 align:start position:0%
school with a later start time and the
 
06:43:10.628 --> 06:43:10.638 align:start position:0%
decrease in stress and conflict is
 
06:43:13.270 --> 06:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
unimaginable the improved sleep the
 
06:43:16.150 --> 06:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
return of curiosity excitement and
 
06:43:20.310 --> 06:43:20.320 align:start position:0%
enthusiasm hearing my kid singing again
 
06:43:23.468 --> 06:43:23.478 align:start position:0%
spontaneously this is a game Cher this
 
06:43:26.350 --> 06:43:26.360 align:start position:0%
lets our kids be kids and I want it for
 
06:43:29.030 --> 06:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
all of the kids of our state so let's
 
06:43:33.310 --> 06:43:33.320 align:start position:0%
follow the research to relief I urge you
 
06:43:36.590 --> 06:43:36.600 align:start position:0%
to approve this bill this study so that
 
06:43:39.468 --> 06:43:39.478 align:start position:0%
we can prioritize the physical emotional
 
06:43:41.548 --> 06:43:41.558 align:start position:0%
and mental well-being of the Youth of
 
06:43:43.788 --> 06:43:43.798 align:start position:0%
our state thank
 
06:43:47.030 --> 06:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much anybody have any
 
06:43:49.868 --> 06:43:49.878 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
06:43:52.430 --> 06:43:52.440 align:start position:0%
NATO yes thank you for uh coming out
 
06:43:55.230 --> 06:43:55.240 align:start position:0%
here and testifying uh for the uh the
 
06:43:57.910 --> 06:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
youth and uh it's all about health and
 
06:44:01.510 --> 06:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
education education is huge um is is
 
06:44:04.388 --> 06:44:04.398 align:start position:0%
there any national studies that you have
 
06:44:09.070 --> 06:44:09.080 align:start position:0%
looked into to uh kind of go by yes
 
06:44:11.190 --> 06:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
there are there there are so many
 
06:44:13.310 --> 06:44:13.320 align:start position:0%
studies about it being better for
 
06:44:16.468 --> 06:44:16.478 align:start position:0%
children and so my understanding is that
 
06:44:18.548 --> 06:44:18.558 align:start position:0%
this bill is to help figure out what
 
06:44:20.270 --> 06:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
would be best for the students in this
 
06:44:22.750 --> 06:44:22.760 align:start position:0%
state and how could we make things
 
06:44:25.990 --> 06:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
happen here that are effective for
 
06:44:28.708 --> 06:44:28.718 align:start position:0%
everyone um yeah thank did that answer
 
06:44:30.590 --> 06:44:30.600 align:start position:0%

[Laughter]

06:44:35.788 --> 06:44:35.798 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
06:44:37.230 --> 06:44:37.240 align:start position:0%
any other
 
06:44:39.628 --> 06:44:39.638 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
06:44:44.190 --> 06:44:44.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:51.150 --> 06:44:51.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:54.510 --> 06:44:54.520 align:start position:0%
n thank you madam chair um my name is
 
06:44:56.388 --> 06:44:56.398 align:start position:0%
jod n and I represent chesha por and
 
06:44:59.110 --> 06:44:59.120 align:start position:0%
Kean uh I actually think that most of
 
06:45:00.750 --> 06:45:00.760 align:start position:0%
what I wanted to say has already been
 
06:45:03.110 --> 06:45:03.120 align:start position:0%
covered but I will address uh what
 
06:45:04.948 --> 06:45:04.958 align:start position:0%
aspect that I was going to actually as a
 
06:45:06.830 --> 06:45:06.840 align:start position:0%
mom because it would answer
 
06:45:09.548 --> 06:45:09.558 align:start position:0%
representative celik's question um my
 
06:45:13.670 --> 06:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
oldest he's 17 now um and he uh is a
 
06:45:15.830 --> 06:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
helper for the unified basketball team
 
06:45:18.150 --> 06:45:18.160 align:start position:0%
at his school um and also he plays
 
06:45:20.110 --> 06:45:20.120 align:start position:0%
baseball when it's in season sometimes
 
06:45:22.190 --> 06:45:22.200 align:start position:0%
he doesn't get back until 9:30 or 10:00
 
06:45:24.110 --> 06:45:24.120 align:start position:0%
when it's an away game and I can't
 
06:45:26.670 --> 06:45:26.680 align:start position:0%
imagine him having to get up at 6:00 the
 
06:45:29.030 --> 06:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
next morning um and go to school
 
06:45:31.388 --> 06:45:31.398 align:start position:0%
fortunately uh what Keen did was we put
 
06:45:33.430 --> 06:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
out a survey to all of the parents this
 
06:45:34.628 --> 06:45:34.638 align:start position:0%
was I think kind of as we were
 
06:45:36.910 --> 06:45:36.920 align:start position:0%
recovering from Co and uh everybody's
 
06:45:38.190 --> 06:45:38.200 align:start position:0%
getting back into the swing of things
 
06:45:39.910 --> 06:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
and they said you know when do you think
 
06:45:41.510 --> 06:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh do you think we should make school
 
06:45:44.230 --> 06:45:44.240 align:start position:0%
start times later we all voted or I
 
06:45:45.948 --> 06:45:45.958 align:start position:0%
voted I don't know a majority of us
 
06:45:48.150 --> 06:45:48.160 align:start position:0%
voted and we all said that yes we would
 
06:45:50.230 --> 06:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
like for it to be later so we were able
 
06:45:52.190 --> 06:45:52.200 align:start position:0%
to do that in Keen what I see about this
 
06:45:54.030 --> 06:45:54.040 align:start position:0%
is the fact that you know in some places
 
06:45:56.310 --> 06:45:56.320 align:start position:0%
it's it's not possible for one reason or
 
06:45:58.350 --> 06:45:58.360 align:start position:0%
another there are um potentially
 
06:46:00.430 --> 06:46:00.440 align:start position:0%
barriers in the way we've talked about
 
06:46:02.350 --> 06:46:02.360 align:start position:0%
uh busing and things like that and I
 
06:46:04.670 --> 06:46:04.680 align:start position:0%
think that it deserves a Statewide
 
06:46:07.788 --> 06:46:07.798 align:start position:0%
conversation so that we can decide um
 
06:46:11.708 --> 06:46:11.718 align:start position:0%
what we think would be the um the best
 
06:46:13.948 --> 06:46:13.958 align:start position:0%
guidelines to go by um and figure out
 
06:46:15.628 --> 06:46:15.638 align:start position:0%
how we can do that how we can come
 
06:46:17.750 --> 06:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
together possibly to do that and make it
 
06:46:19.948 --> 06:46:19.958 align:start position:0%
work for our children um in their health
 
06:46:22.030 --> 06:46:22.040 align:start position:0%
and mental health which has been
 
06:46:24.110 --> 06:46:24.120 align:start position:0%
addressed so I won't waste your time
 
06:46:27.430 --> 06:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
that's basically what I wanted to chip
 
06:46:30.310 --> 06:46:30.320 align:start position:0%
in thank you any
 
06:46:33.548 --> 06:46:33.558 align:start position:0%
questions representative cel thank you
 
06:46:35.590 --> 06:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you representative
 
06:46:37.708 --> 06:46:37.718 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I'm I'm curious
 
06:46:39.910 --> 06:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
where Keen like oyer River has pushed
 
06:46:42.310 --> 06:46:42.320 align:start position:0%
their start time later whether um you've
 
06:46:44.350 --> 06:46:44.360 align:start position:0%
not had a discussion in your community
 
06:46:46.070 --> 06:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
which has proven to be a challenge in
 
06:46:47.868 --> 06:46:47.878 align:start position:0%
our community where we have parents who
 
06:46:49.350 --> 06:46:49.360 align:start position:0%
are now struggling for before school
 
06:46:52.708 --> 06:46:52.718 align:start position:0%
care um with the younger children um
 
06:46:54.590 --> 06:46:54.600 align:start position:0%
with start times because they need to be
 
06:46:57.590 --> 06:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
at work before the school buses uh get
 
06:47:00.350 --> 06:47:00.360 align:start position:0%
to the elementary roots and so whether
 
06:47:02.430 --> 06:47:02.440 align:start position:0%
um that's been an issue in your District
 
06:47:03.990 --> 06:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
it's I know there's so many different
 
06:47:05.510 --> 06:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
nuances which is why I think about this
 
06:47:08.150 --> 06:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
as a local issue but um I'm just curious
 
06:47:09.750 --> 06:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
whether that's shown up in Keane as well
 
06:47:11.830 --> 06:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
yeah absolutely I will say that I have
 
06:47:14.788 --> 06:47:14.798 align:start position:0%
not heard from anyone um about that and
 
06:47:16.628 --> 06:47:16.638 align:start position:0%
that's not to say that it isn't a
 
06:47:19.388 --> 06:47:19.398 align:start position:0%
concern uh but starting at 8:30 with the
 
06:47:21.670 --> 06:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
you know normal kind of business hours
 
06:47:23.110 --> 06:47:23.120 align:start position:0%
um it does provide for people to be able
 
06:47:24.590 --> 06:47:24.600 align:start position:0%
to get to work by nine at least if
 
06:47:27.948 --> 06:47:27.958 align:start position:0%
they're local um but you know it it
 
06:47:30.030 --> 06:47:30.040 align:start position:0%
might be U an issue for some but I have
 
06:47:34.230 --> 06:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:35.350 --> 06:47:35.360 align:start position:0%
any other
 
06:47:39.990 --> 06:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:43.868 --> 06:47:43.878 align:start position:0%
you um Angela and I can't quite read the
 
06:47:43.878 --> 06:47:44.868 align:start position:0%
you um Angela and I can't quite read the
last

06:47:44.868 --> 06:47:44.878 align:start position:0%
last
 
06:47:44.878 --> 06:47:46.990 align:start position:0%
last
name

06:47:46.990 --> 06:47:47.000 align:start position:0%
name
 
06:47:52.590 --> 06:47:52.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:54.510 --> 06:47:54.520 align:start position:0%
that good
 
06:47:56.910 --> 06:47:56.920 align:start position:0%
afternoon I'm a parent of three school
 
06:47:59.628 --> 06:47:59.638 align:start position:0%
age kids one of whom is Sierra and I
 
06:48:01.230 --> 06:48:01.240 align:start position:0%
have two other kids another middle
 
06:48:02.990 --> 06:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
schooler and then one in elementary
 
06:48:05.910 --> 06:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
school and um as you heard the uh middle
 
06:48:10.430 --> 06:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
school starts at 7:15 a.m. and I um I
 
06:48:12.548 --> 06:48:12.558 align:start position:0%
wanted to just address a couple of the
 
06:48:14.150 --> 06:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
points and questions that came up
 
06:48:15.788 --> 06:48:15.798 align:start position:0%
earlier because I'm one of the parents
 
06:48:18.070 --> 06:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
who's also active within our local
 
06:48:19.708 --> 06:48:19.718 align:start position:0%
school district of seeing whether we can
 
06:48:23.430 --> 06:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
make a change locally um so busing
 
06:48:26.150 --> 06:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
certainly is a challenge I think both in
 
06:48:27.830 --> 06:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
local districts and I don't know
 
06:48:30.990 --> 06:48:31.000 align:start position:0%
Statewide as well there may be policies
 
06:48:33.190 --> 06:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
around how busing has to happen that
 
06:48:35.388 --> 06:48:35.398 align:start position:0%
could shift and I think with within our
 
06:48:37.670 --> 06:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
district we've had we did a whole effort
 
06:48:39.868 --> 06:48:39.878 align:start position:0%
on potentially consolidating schools and
 
06:48:42.388 --> 06:48:42.398 align:start position:0%
then our superintendent left and so
 
06:48:44.270 --> 06:48:44.280 align:start position:0%
we've had a hard time sort of gaining
 
06:48:46.670 --> 06:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
momentum on this issue even though you
 
06:48:47.948 --> 06:48:47.958 align:start position:0%
know there are kids like you just saw
 
06:48:49.990 --> 06:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
these three kids that are it's making
 
06:48:52.590 --> 06:48:52.600 align:start position:0%
their ability to focus in school to be
 
06:48:54.788 --> 06:48:54.798 align:start position:0%
successful students worse you know each
 
06:48:56.430 --> 06:48:56.440 align:start position:0%
day so continuing to kick the hand on
 
06:49:00.190 --> 06:49:00.200 align:start position:0%
the road is hard um another hat that I
 
06:49:02.150 --> 06:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
wear is I'm the South Meadow School
 
06:49:03.788 --> 06:49:03.798 align:start position:0%
track coach
 
06:49:06.150 --> 06:49:06.160 align:start position:0%
and um so I've seen firsthand that it
 
06:49:08.070 --> 06:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
can be really challenging when some
 
06:49:11.670 --> 06:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
schools end at 4: and some end at 25 so
 
06:49:13.150 --> 06:49:13.160 align:start position:0%
we've had track meets that don't start
 
06:49:15.310 --> 06:49:15.320 align:start position:0%
till 4:30 and my kids are like sitting
 
06:49:17.310 --> 06:49:17.320 align:start position:0%
around saying oh when is this track meet
 
06:49:19.230 --> 06:49:19.240 align:start position:0%
going to start and we're waiting for you
 
06:49:22.190 --> 06:49:22.200 align:start position:0%
know other schools to get out um I also
 
06:49:24.150 --> 06:49:24.160 align:start position:0%
know for school districts that end later
 
06:49:26.030 --> 06:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
there's been cases where the basketball
 
06:49:28.788 --> 06:49:28.798 align:start position:0%
team leaves at 2 and the kids miss two
 
06:49:30.868 --> 06:49:30.878 align:start position:0%
periods of school so I don't think it's
 
06:49:33.190 --> 06:49:33.200 align:start position:0%
great when you have school districts
 
06:49:35.670 --> 06:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
some do it some don't it creates some
 
06:49:38.430 --> 06:49:38.440 align:start position:0%
challenges um with that so my
 
06:49:40.388 --> 06:49:40.398 align:start position:0%
inclination is for us to study it as a
 
06:49:42.548 --> 06:49:42.558 align:start position:0%
state and potentially provide you know a
 
06:49:44.510 --> 06:49:44.520 align:start position:0%
Statewide conversation and momentum
 
06:49:47.310 --> 06:49:47.320 align:start position:0%
toward it just being a cultural shift um
 
06:49:49.548 --> 06:49:49.558 align:start position:0%
that the day is is shifted for our
 
06:49:52.110 --> 06:49:52.120 align:start position:0%
students um but a couple pieces that I
 
06:49:54.150 --> 06:49:54.160 align:start position:0%
had written down that I I wanted to talk
 
06:49:56.110 --> 06:49:56.120 align:start position:0%
to um one is just the personal
 
06:49:57.590 --> 06:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
experience you know you heard from
 
06:50:00.190 --> 06:50:00.200 align:start position:0%
Sierra and some of her friends and as a
 
06:50:01.910 --> 06:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
parent it's really hard having these
 
06:50:03.150 --> 06:50:03.160 align:start position:0%
discussions that
 
06:50:05.190 --> 06:50:05.200 align:start position:0%
6:30 in the morning about is the stomach
 
06:50:06.708 --> 06:50:06.718 align:start position:0%
ache because you didn't get enough sleep
 
06:50:08.388 --> 06:50:08.398 align:start position:0%
and what's your first class and do we
 
06:50:11.190 --> 06:50:11.200 align:start position:0%
let you go in late or do we not and um
 
06:50:13.030 --> 06:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
because as you know when you don't feel
 
06:50:14.948 --> 06:50:14.958 align:start position:0%
when you don't sleep enough you may know
 
06:50:16.590 --> 06:50:16.600 align:start position:0%
as an adult you get a stomach ache you
 
06:50:19.350 --> 06:50:19.360 align:start position:0%
get a headache it's hard to focus and so
 
06:50:20.788 --> 06:50:20.798 align:start position:0%
it's hard for parents too trying to
 
06:50:23.788 --> 06:50:23.798 align:start position:0%
discern with our kids when to push and
 
06:50:26.990 --> 06:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
and when not um also as we know middle
 
06:50:28.788 --> 06:50:28.798 align:start position:0%
school high school being a teenager is
 
06:50:31.468 --> 06:50:31.478 align:start position:0%
not an easy phase of life um there's a
 
06:50:33.750 --> 06:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
lot of complex social social dynamics
 
06:50:35.388 --> 06:50:35.398 align:start position:0%
and so if you show up and you're
 
06:50:38.468 --> 06:50:38.478 align:start position:0%
exhausted it's harder to navigate that
 
06:50:40.948 --> 06:50:40.958 align:start position:0%
um one of my kids had math as their
 
06:50:43.388 --> 06:50:43.398 align:start position:0%
first block and was having a much harder
 
06:50:45.110 --> 06:50:45.120 align:start position:0%
time focusing they were half asleep
 
06:50:46.708 --> 06:50:46.718 align:start position:0%
during math class and I thought oh my
 
06:50:48.270 --> 06:50:48.280 align:start position:0%
gosh you got to be learning math this is
 
06:50:50.070 --> 06:50:50.080 align:start position:0%
really important and so as a parent I
 
06:50:51.590 --> 06:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
really want my kid when they're at
 
06:50:54.990 --> 06:50:55.000 align:start position:0%
school to have the ability to really
 
06:50:59.190 --> 06:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
focus um my other middle schooler is
 
06:51:00.750 --> 06:51:00.760 align:start position:0%
he's pretty good at powering through
 
06:51:02.990 --> 06:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
just his personality but he gets pretty
 
06:51:04.948 --> 06:51:04.958 align:start position:0%
grumpy and often in the morning he's
 
06:51:07.030 --> 06:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
grumpy and he also gets these extensive
 
06:51:08.788 --> 06:51:08.798 align:start position:0%
headaches that you know I think that if
 
06:51:11.270 --> 06:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
he was able to be well rested every day
 
06:51:13.150 --> 06:51:13.160 align:start position:0%
um that wouldn't be happening for him
 
06:51:14.468 --> 06:51:14.478 align:start position:0%
and he's really clear he had a
 
06:51:15.910 --> 06:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
basketball game this afternoon so
 
06:51:18.270 --> 06:51:18.280 align:start position:0%
couldn't come but he really feels like
 
06:51:20.270 --> 06:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
for both himself and for his other
 
06:51:21.750 --> 06:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
classmates they would be in much more in
 
06:51:23.670 --> 06:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
a position to thrive if they were
 
06:51:25.590 --> 06:51:25.600 align:start position:0%
showing up well
 
06:51:28.708 --> 06:51:28.718 align:start position:0%
rested um so I really feel like our
 
06:51:30.948 --> 06:51:30.958 align:start position:0%
Public Schools will be better and many
 
06:51:32.868 --> 06:51:32.878 align:start position:0%
students across the state would do back
 
06:51:34.590 --> 06:51:34.600 align:start position:0%
better academically and socially with
 
06:51:36.868 --> 06:51:36.878 align:start position:0%
this very simple step of of moving the
 
06:51:38.910 --> 06:51:38.920 align:start position:0%
start time back and this legislation can
 
06:51:41.590 --> 06:51:41.600 align:start position:0%
help us find the best ways to do that
 
06:51:43.270 --> 06:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
second I just very briefly want to talk
 
06:51:45.388 --> 06:51:45.398 align:start position:0%
about from the athletic perspective as I
 
06:51:47.708 --> 06:51:47.718 align:start position:0%
said I'm a track coach and then I also
 
06:51:49.388 --> 06:51:49.398 align:start position:0%
have coached many different rep Sports
 
06:51:52.628 --> 06:51:52.638 align:start position:0%
in our community and we push kids in
 
06:51:54.270 --> 06:51:54.280 align:start position:0%
sports we push them to run these hard
 
06:51:56.150 --> 06:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
repeats we push them to do all the
 
06:51:58.628 --> 06:51:58.638 align:start position:0%
strength work and complicated jumping
 
06:52:00.990 --> 06:52:01.000 align:start position:0%
drills and when kids get enough sleep
 
06:52:03.388 --> 06:52:03.398 align:start position:0%
they can do that much better um there's
 
06:52:05.830 --> 06:52:05.840 align:start position:0%
a bunch of different studies around
 
06:52:10.230 --> 06:52:10.240 align:start position:0%
sleep um a 2011 Stanford study found
 
06:52:12.388 --> 06:52:12.398 align:start position:0%
that college basketball college
 
06:52:14.468 --> 06:52:14.478 align:start position:0%
basketball players shot more accurately
 
06:52:17.590 --> 06:52:17.600 align:start position:0%
and ran faster after they got more sleep
 
06:52:19.990 --> 06:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
professional sports teams often track
 
06:52:23.070 --> 06:52:23.080 align:start position:0%
athletes sleep and it influences the
 
06:52:26.948 --> 06:52:26.958 align:start position:0%
scheduling of the um games and meets and
 
06:52:29.150 --> 06:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
there was a study of 160 student
 
06:52:30.670 --> 06:52:30.680 align:start position:0%
athletes at a Middle High School in
 
06:52:33.388 --> 06:52:33.398 align:start position:0%
California and sleep ration was the
 
06:52:37.070 --> 06:52:37.080 align:start position:0%
biggest cause behind athletic injuries
 
06:52:39.388 --> 06:52:39.398 align:start position:0%
so students who slept less than 8 hours
 
06:52:42.270 --> 06:52:42.280 align:start position:0%
on average were 1.7 times more likely to
 
06:52:44.788 --> 06:52:44.798 align:start position:0%
suffer an injury than those who averaged
 
06:52:47.788 --> 06:52:47.798 align:start position:0%
eight or more hours and so there's also
 
06:52:51.708 --> 06:52:51.718 align:start position:0%
um an athletic perspective for um uh
 
06:52:54.548 --> 06:52:54.558 align:start position:0%
another reason behind um encouraging us
 
06:52:57.708 --> 06:52:57.718 align:start position:0%
to let kids sleep more so I just feel
 
06:53:01.030 --> 06:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
like the studies are really clear and um
 
06:53:02.948 --> 06:53:02.958 align:start position:0%
many students and parents would really
 
06:53:05.030 --> 06:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
benefit teachers too and I think if we
 
06:53:07.030 --> 06:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
really want our kids in our state to
 
06:53:09.910 --> 06:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
thrive um I think it's a really
 
06:53:11.788 --> 06:53:11.798 align:start position:0%
reasonable step forward that we could be
 
06:53:13.708 --> 06:53:13.718 align:start position:0%
taking thank
 
06:53:17.150 --> 06:53:17.160 align:start position:0%
you thank you any
 
06:53:20.230 --> 06:53:20.240 align:start position:0%
questions no thank you thank you for
 
06:53:22.468 --> 06:53:22.478 align:start position:0%
taking my question it seems like a a lot
 
06:53:23.990 --> 06:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
of the input that we're getting is from
 
06:53:26.548 --> 06:53:26.558 align:start position:0%
Peterboro and I I I wasn't clear on what
 
06:53:29.070 --> 06:53:29.080 align:start position:0%
you said and has Peter Boro been working
 
06:53:30.510 --> 06:53:30.520 align:start position:0%
on this issue
 
06:53:33.270 --> 06:53:33.280 align:start position:0%
or that's a good question yeah and I
 
06:53:33.280 --> 06:53:34.350 align:start position:0%
or that's a good question yeah and I
think

06:53:34.350 --> 06:53:34.360 align:start position:0%
think
 
06:53:36.670 --> 06:53:36.680 align:start position:0%
um some of us parents worked on it
 
06:53:38.788 --> 06:53:38.798 align:start position:0%
locally and then we knew rep Jonah
 
06:53:41.468 --> 06:53:41.478 align:start position:0%
wheeler and talked to him and we also um
 
06:53:43.230 --> 06:53:43.240 align:start position:0%
have started connecting with a national
 
06:53:46.270 --> 06:53:46.280 align:start position:0%
group called uh I think it's called
 
06:53:48.750 --> 06:53:48.760 align:start position:0%
starts starts I have to look get back to
 
06:53:50.230 --> 06:53:50.240 align:start position:0%
the National Group but there's different
 
06:53:52.310 --> 06:53:52.320 align:start position:0%
entities uh across the country that are
 
06:53:53.990 --> 06:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
working both locally in school districts
 
06:53:56.388 --> 06:53:56.398 align:start position:0%
and on Statewide legislation and we had
 
06:53:57.910 --> 06:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
heard that there's several states that
 
06:54:00.788 --> 06:54:00.798 align:start position:0%
have passed laws you know some are very
 
06:54:02.388 --> 06:54:02.398 align:start position:0%
simple saying middle school or high
 
06:54:05.310 --> 06:54:05.320 align:start position:0%
School can't start before 8:00 or 8:30
 
06:54:07.030 --> 06:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
and then others are my impression more
 
06:54:09.990 --> 06:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
sort of carrot type legislation or they
 
06:54:11.628 --> 06:54:11.638 align:start position:0%
may relate to busing or different
 
06:54:13.230 --> 06:54:13.240 align:start position:0%
changes that are sort of around the
 
06:54:17.070 --> 06:54:17.080 align:start position:0%
edges of it um but yes we're we're from
 
06:54:20.110 --> 06:54:20.120 align:start position:0%
Peterboro and before my kids were really
 
06:54:22.430 --> 06:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
sort of in the mix with school there was
 
06:54:27.510 --> 06:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
an effort I think like 2017 2018 or so
 
06:54:28.868 --> 06:54:28.878 align:start position:0%
that there was a whole effort and then
 
06:54:32.430 --> 06:54:32.440 align:start position:0%
it was put on um as a ballot initiative
 
06:54:32.440 --> 06:54:33.468 align:start position:0%
it was put on um as a ballot initiative
two

06:54:33.468 --> 06:54:33.478 align:start position:0%
two
 
06:54:36.910 --> 06:54:36.920 align:start position:0%
families um that was a a busing will you
 
06:54:38.990 --> 06:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
pay the certain amount for busing but I
 
06:54:40.430 --> 06:54:40.440 align:start position:0%
don't my understanding is there wasn't
 
06:54:41.830 --> 06:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
as much work done around really
 
06:54:43.750 --> 06:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
education and engagement it was just
 
06:54:45.230 --> 06:54:45.240 align:start position:0%
like do you want to pay a whole bunch of
 
06:54:48.430 --> 06:54:48.440 align:start position:0%
money yes or no and it ended up failing
 
06:54:50.910 --> 06:54:50.920 align:start position:0%
and then um myself and several other
 
06:54:53.510 --> 06:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
parents in the last two years I'd say
 
06:54:56.868 --> 06:54:56.878 align:start position:0%
sort of rebr the issue up our previous
 
06:55:00.310 --> 06:55:00.320 align:start position:0%
superintendent um was very open to the
 
06:55:01.830 --> 06:55:01.840 align:start position:0%
conversations we went to some of the
 
06:55:04.468 --> 06:55:04.478 align:start position:0%
school board meetings and um our
 
06:55:05.910 --> 06:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
Administration was very clear that it
 
06:55:07.510 --> 06:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
was the right thing to do for students
 
06:55:09.070 --> 06:55:09.080 align:start position:0%
but the conille school district was
 
06:55:11.708 --> 06:55:11.718 align:start position:0%
looking at uh consolidation and that
 
06:55:13.910 --> 06:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
really needed to be the focus initially
 
06:55:15.110 --> 06:55:15.120 align:start position:0%
figuring out if we were going to close
 
06:55:17.110 --> 06:55:17.120 align:start position:0%
some of our elementary schools and then
 
06:55:18.830 --> 06:55:18.840 align:start position:0%
our superintendent left and so we just
 
06:55:20.990 --> 06:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
lost a little bit of steam and my
 
06:55:24.110 --> 06:55:24.120 align:start position:0%
perspective as a parent is that you know
 
06:55:25.910 --> 06:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll try on all levels we'll try
 
06:55:27.910 --> 06:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
with our school district we'll try at
 
06:55:31.070 --> 06:55:31.080 align:start position:0%
the state um but related to some of my
 
06:55:33.590 --> 06:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
earlier points about Athletics I think
 
06:55:35.628 --> 06:55:35.638 align:start position:0%
it's a actually a challenge if you have
 
06:55:37.110 --> 06:55:37.120 align:start position:0%
some school districts go and other
 
06:55:39.868 --> 06:55:39.878 align:start position:0%
school districts not go and I also feel
 
06:55:41.990 --> 06:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
like if it's better for all the students
 
06:55:43.350 --> 06:55:43.360 align:start position:0%
let's have all the students get the
 
06:55:46.070 --> 06:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
benefit not just some students get the
 
06:55:48.230 --> 06:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
benefit but not
 
06:55:51.830 --> 06:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
others yeah thank you any other
 
06:55:57.270 --> 06:55:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:11.830 --> 06:56:11.840 align:start position:0%

next meeting and the next email I got

health insurance and um early incentive
 
06:57:59.190 --> 06:57:59.200 align:start position:0%

06:58:04.990 --> 06:58:05.000 align:start position:0%
training policy work uh I don't know
 
06:58:06.388 --> 06:58:06.398 align:start position:0%
those that we know have have a handful
 
06:58:08.030 --> 06:58:08.040 align:start position:0%
of members that serve time on their
 
06:58:10.350 --> 06:58:10.360 align:start position:0%
local their local school board the new
 
06:58:11.708 --> 06:58:11.718 align:start position:0%
individuals if you are on your local
 
06:58:12.948 --> 06:58:12.958 align:start position:0%
school board I'm not aware but we
 
06:58:14.110 --> 06:58:14.120 align:start position:0%
certainly appreciate you for your
 
06:58:16.708 --> 06:58:16.718 align:start position:0%
service if you ever did um School boards
 
06:58:18.868 --> 06:58:18.878 align:start position:0%
are governed by policies and policy
 
06:58:21.788 --> 06:58:21.798 align:start position:0%
manuals there are about 70 75 policies
 
06:58:23.788 --> 06:58:23.798 align:start position:0%
that are required by law the school
 
06:58:25.670 --> 06:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
boards Association maintains a sample
 
06:58:27.708 --> 06:58:27.718 align:start position:0%
policy manual probably about four or 500
 
06:58:30.830 --> 06:58:30.840 align:start position:0%
sample policies um that we keep on file
 
06:58:33.430 --> 06:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
we categorize them anywhere from
 
06:58:36.708 --> 06:58:36.718 align:start position:0%
required by law um recommended and
 
06:58:38.590 --> 06:58:38.600 align:start position:0%
optional many of the optional policies
 
06:58:40.590 --> 06:58:40.600 align:start position:0%
we just keep on file and it's not we
 
06:58:42.590 --> 06:58:42.600 align:start position:0%
don't put it we don't distribute it out
 
06:58:45.070 --> 06:58:45.080 align:start position:0%
per se but rather um we keep it on file
 
06:58:46.510 --> 06:58:46.520 align:start position:0%
so if a school board asks if we have a
 
06:58:49.230 --> 06:58:49.240 align:start position:0%
policy on topic X we have one on file
 
06:58:51.510 --> 06:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
ready to go we also have a director of
 
06:58:54.628 --> 06:58:54.638 align:start position:0%
governmental relations um Becky Wilson
 
06:58:57.030 --> 06:58:57.040 align:start position:0%
Becky is the educator on staff she's a
 
06:58:59.350 --> 06:58:59.360 align:start position:0%
former special education uh director
 
06:59:00.948 --> 06:59:00.958 align:start position:0%

Becky um has the um background
 
06:59:10.388 --> 06:59:10.398 align:start position:0%
experience and and expertise to talk
 
06:59:12.708 --> 06:59:12.718 align:start position:0%
about sort of operationalizing those
 
06:59:14.350 --> 06:59:14.360 align:start position:0%
School District policies if you will and
 
06:59:16.830 --> 06:59:16.840 align:start position:0%
it's really sort of our voice for what
 
06:59:18.270 --> 06:59:18.280 align:start position:0%
it means to be in the building with
 
06:59:20.788 --> 06:59:20.798 align:start position:0%
students with parents with staff members
 
06:59:22.750 --> 06:59:22.760 align:start position:0%
um and and what can happen talking about
 
06:59:24.788 --> 06:59:24.798 align:start position:0%
start times I'll just say Bell to Bell
 
06:59:27.590 --> 06:59:27.600 align:start position:0%

06:59:29.468 --> 06:59:29.478 align:start position:0%
the school boards Association for about

mostly doing um what my office manager
 
06:59:45.430 --> 06:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
tells me I need to do um because she
 
06:59:47.110 --> 06:59:47.120 align:start position:0%
runs the office to be quite honest with
 
06:59:49.430 --> 06:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
you um but um at at times I do a little
 
06:59:50.628 --> 06:59:50.638 align:start position:0%
bit of everything I still do a little
 
06:59:51.868 --> 06:59:51.878 align:start position:0%
bit of the training I do a little bit of
 
06:59:54.070 --> 06:59:54.080 align:start position:0%
the legislative advocacy um and I do a
 
06:59:55.510 --> 06:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
little bit of the legal work I don't do
 
06:59:58.548 --> 06:59:58.558 align:start position:0%
the policy work anymore cuz I I it was a
 
07:00:00.990 --> 07:00:01.000 align:start position:0%

from members of the committee that
 
07:00:37.590 --> 07:00:37.600 align:start position:0%
they're calling me not on a legislative
 
07:00:38.750 --> 07:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
issue but they're just saying hey this
 
07:00:40.190 --> 07:00:40.200 align:start position:0%
was going on in our school district what
 
07:00:41.948 --> 07:00:41.958 align:start position:0%

07:00:46.230 --> 07:00:46.240 align:start position:0%
we're here to be a resource um not just
 
07:00:48.310 --> 07:00:48.320 align:start position:0%
for our local school boards but for um
 
07:00:49.510 --> 07:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
this committee and other committees in
 
07:00:51.868 --> 07:00:51.878 align:start position:0%
the legislature as well too um as you'll
 
07:00:54.590 --> 07:00:54.600 align:start position:0%
find out for example with House Bill 184
 
07:00:56.750 --> 07:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not taking a position on the bill uh
 
07:00:58.388 --> 07:00:58.398 align:start position:0%
we do that from time to time we don't
 
07:01:00.070 --> 07:01:00.080 align:start position:0%
take positions on bills but rather we
 
07:01:02.230 --> 07:01:02.240 align:start position:0%
come here um and for example example if
 
07:01:04.070 --> 07:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
you have a special education Bill Miss
 
07:01:06.430 --> 07:01:06.440 align:start position:0%
Wilson from our office former special
 
07:01:08.110 --> 07:01:08.120 align:start position:0%
education director we may not take a
 
07:01:09.430 --> 07:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
position on the bill but she can sit
 
07:01:10.750 --> 07:01:10.760 align:start position:0%
here and talk to you for two or three
 
07:01:13.070 --> 07:01:13.080 align:start position:0%
hours about special education and just
 
07:01:15.670 --> 07:01:15.680 align:start position:0%
just use that as as as one example as as
 
07:01:18.110 --> 07:01:18.120 align:start position:0%
I see some Chuckles around the room so
 
07:01:20.468 --> 07:01:20.478 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the time uh uh
 
07:01:22.628 --> 07:01:22.638 align:start position:0%
representative Madam chair to let me
 
07:01:26.150 --> 07:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
sort of fill in the gaps on that um uh
 
07:01:28.110 --> 07:01:28.120 align:start position:0%
jumping to to our testimony on House
 
07:01:29.868 --> 07:01:29.878 align:start position:0%
Bill 185 again the school boards
 
07:01:32.030 --> 07:01:32.040 align:start position:0%
Association is not taking a position on
 
07:01:34.670 --> 07:01:34.680 align:start position:0%
this bill I think everything um about
 
07:01:37.990 --> 07:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
nhs's comments um have have already been
 
07:01:40.350 --> 07:01:40.360 align:start position:0%
spoken both by representative wheeler um
 
07:01:41.670 --> 07:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
by some of the other Representatives
 
07:01:43.830 --> 07:01:43.840 align:start position:0%
that spoke and and some of the other uh
 
07:01:45.548 --> 07:01:45.558 align:start position:0%
maybe the parents that spoke as well too
 
07:01:48.030 --> 07:01:48.040 align:start position:0%
and certainly I'd be remiss um without
 
07:01:49.948 --> 07:01:49.958 align:start position:0%
um without recognizing and thanking the
 
07:01:52.310 --> 07:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
three young women who who came and and
 
07:01:53.868 --> 07:01:53.878 align:start position:0%
testified it's always great when we have
 
07:01:56.270 --> 07:01:56.280 align:start position:0%
students in the in this room is isn't it
 
07:01:59.310 --> 07:01:59.320 align:start position:0%
um so um there are challenges with
 
07:02:02.270 --> 07:02:02.280 align:start position:0%
school start times um and the test I
 
07:02:05.150 --> 07:02:05.160 align:start position:0%
think elicited that what I think is most
 
07:02:08.430 --> 07:02:08.440 align:start position:0%
important um to take away from though is
 
07:02:10.670 --> 07:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
that we heard that this was addressed in
 
07:02:12.230 --> 07:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
the Oyster River School District we
 
07:02:13.590 --> 07:02:13.600 align:start position:0%
heard it was addressed in the Salem
 
07:02:15.388 --> 07:02:15.398 align:start position:0%
school district and somebody mentioned I
 
07:02:17.510 --> 07:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
believe Keen if I'm not mistaken but all
 
07:02:19.110 --> 07:02:19.120 align:start position:0%
three of those were done locally right
 
07:02:21.270 --> 07:02:21.280 align:start position:0%
the local communities had that had that
 
07:02:23.670 --> 07:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
conversation um about what was best for
 
07:02:25.468 --> 07:02:25.478 align:start position:0%
for their community and their parents
 
07:02:27.628 --> 07:02:27.638 align:start position:0%
and their students um some of the
 
07:02:30.868 --> 07:02:30.878 align:start position:0%
challenges um with with sort of so to
 
07:02:33.150 --> 07:02:33.160 align:start position:0%
the study committee it's self nsba would
 
07:02:34.670 --> 07:02:34.680 align:start position:0%
have no objection if the if the
 
07:02:36.590 --> 07:02:36.600 align:start position:0%
legislature wants to create a committee
 
07:02:38.468 --> 07:02:38.478 align:start position:0%
and bring in school administrators bring
 
07:02:40.990 --> 07:02:41.000 align:start position:0%
in pediatricians or parents that have
 
07:02:43.070 --> 07:02:43.080 align:start position:0%
studied this and school board members
 
07:02:44.868 --> 07:02:44.878 align:start position:0%
and the transportation companies and
 
07:02:46.910 --> 07:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
hsba is happy to be a part of that
 
07:02:49.230 --> 07:02:49.240 align:start position:0%
conversation and assist with whatever we
 
07:02:51.190 --> 07:02:51.200 align:start position:0%
can relative to what may come out of
 
07:02:53.590 --> 07:02:53.600 align:start position:0%
that committee Our concern was and I
 
07:02:54.910 --> 07:02:54.920 align:start position:0%
think representative Cher you had
 
07:02:56.910 --> 07:02:56.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned line 10 the committee shall
 
07:02:58.708 --> 07:02:58.718 align:start position:0%
study what types of legislation would
 
07:03:00.868 --> 07:03:00.878 align:start position:0%
most effectively allow changes to school
 
07:03:03.070 --> 07:03:03.080 align:start position:0%
start time sort of presupposing the
 
07:03:05.868 --> 07:03:05.878 align:start position:0%
answer if you will um as you've heard me
 
07:03:07.948 --> 07:03:07.958 align:start position:0%
say you the returning members of the
 
07:03:09.510 --> 07:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
committee have heard me say from time to
 
07:03:12.468 --> 07:03:12.478 align:start position:0%
time local challenges tend to have local
 
07:03:14.350 --> 07:03:14.360 align:start position:0%
Solutions um
 
07:03:17.910 --> 07:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
nhsb usually advocates for local control
 
07:03:20.628 --> 07:03:20.638 align:start position:0%
and we would oppose you know any any
 
07:03:23.190 --> 07:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
recommendation from a committee um that
 
07:03:26.628 --> 07:03:26.638 align:start position:0%
would you know um recommend sort of a
 
07:03:28.150 --> 07:03:28.160 align:start position:0%
Statewide start time or Statewide
 
07:03:29.670 --> 07:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
legislation to address this I know
 
07:03:31.030 --> 07:03:31.040 align:start position:0%
that's sort of putting the cart before
 
07:03:32.750 --> 07:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
the horse if you will relative to this
 
07:03:34.590 --> 07:03:34.600 align:start position:0%
bill that's just looking to to create
 
07:03:37.510 --> 07:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
the committee um if but you know I think
 
07:03:39.548 --> 07:03:39.558 align:start position:0%
a lot of the the challenges with with
 
07:03:41.270 --> 07:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
getting some of these start times
 
07:03:43.310 --> 07:03:43.320 align:start position:0%
perhaps later so so kids can sleep in a
 
07:03:45.110 --> 07:03:45.120 align:start position:0%
little bit more have been addressed we
 
07:03:47.230 --> 07:03:47.240 align:start position:0%
have collective bargaining agreements um
 
07:03:49.030 --> 07:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
Statewide that that indicates start and
 
07:03:52.190 --> 07:03:52.200 align:start position:0%
stop times if you will Transportation um
 
07:03:54.990 --> 07:03:55.000 align:start position:0%
has been has been has been addressed um
 
07:03:58.070 --> 07:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
the needs of local parents obviously um
 
07:04:00.310 --> 07:04:00.320 align:start position:0%
staff scheduling intradistrict you have
 
07:04:02.670 --> 07:04:02.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of teachers who are who are
 
07:04:04.590 --> 07:04:04.600 align:start position:0%
parents as well too and they may teach
 
07:04:06.310 --> 07:04:06.320 align:start position:0%
in a different district with where they
 
07:04:07.948 --> 07:04:07.958 align:start position:0%
live so if they need to be in a building
 
07:04:10.788 --> 07:04:10.798 align:start position:0%
at 7:30 or quarter of eight you know for
 
07:04:12.788 --> 07:04:12.798 align:start position:0%
their own for their job how does that
 
07:04:14.388 --> 07:04:14.398 align:start position:0%
impact their ability to get their child
 
07:04:17.948 --> 07:04:17.958 align:start position:0%
to school at 8 or 8:30 um if if if the
 
07:04:19.910 --> 07:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
if the if the towns are on or the school
 
07:04:21.750 --> 07:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
districts are on different start times
 
07:04:24.788 --> 07:04:24.798 align:start position:0%
CTE schedules um I believe u somebody
 
07:04:27.150 --> 07:04:27.160 align:start position:0%
may have mentioned so we know sort of
 
07:04:29.788 --> 07:04:29.798 align:start position:0%
what the challenges are um if this study
 
07:04:32.350 --> 07:04:32.360 align:start position:0%
committee can help people bring people
 
07:04:34.990 --> 07:04:35.000 align:start position:0%
together to identify some solutions to
 
07:04:36.750 --> 07:04:36.760 align:start position:0%
some of those challenges and hsba is
 
07:04:38.628 --> 07:04:38.638 align:start position:0%
fully in support of that so again we're
 
07:04:41.270 --> 07:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
not taking a position um I you know the
 
07:04:43.110 --> 07:04:43.120 align:start position:0%
PE the speakers before me identified all
 
07:04:45.270 --> 07:04:45.280 align:start position:0%
the all the issues but um I just wanted
 
07:04:47.030 --> 07:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
to to address them as well too and again
 
07:04:48.590 --> 07:04:48.600 align:start position:0%
