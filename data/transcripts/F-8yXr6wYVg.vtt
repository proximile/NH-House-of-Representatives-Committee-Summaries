00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:27.749 align:start position:0%
last but not least and it's so important
we'll

00:06:27.749 --> 00:06:27.759 align:start position:0%
we'll
 
00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
probably break in when we have a ways
 
00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
and means
 
00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:34.639 align:start position:0%
up update i i want to wait for
 
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
representative weiler
 
00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
as a minimum before we do that but
 
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
i am cautiously optimistic that we have
 
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
good news breaking um so stay tuned
 
00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
okay with that uh
 
00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
mr ripple would you pull
 
00:06:59.029 --> 00:06:59.039 align:start position:0%
up hb2 and share it
 
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
and take us to section 34.
 
00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:06.080 align:start position:0%
and what i'm going to do is because this
 
00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:06.800 align:start position:0%
is a
 
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
topic that i assume there's a lot of
 
00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:10.309 align:start position:0%
topic that i assume there's a lot of
public

00:07:10.309 --> 00:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
interest in i want to i want to set us
 
00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
up for this discussion
 
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:17.120 align:start position:0%
just a little bit differently than we
 
00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:19.120 align:start position:0%
normally do
 
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
but i i want to provide
 
00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
transparency and an opportunity for
 
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
okay so section 34
 
00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
is what we're going to talk about as
 
00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.629 align:start position:0%
is what we're going to talk about as
proposed

00:07:34.629 --> 00:07:34.639 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
as introduced it's there on lines 4
 
00:07:41.749 --> 00:07:41.759 align:start position:0%
5 6 7 and 8.
 
00:07:45.589 --> 00:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
as i understand these five lines these
 
00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:49.360 align:start position:0%
were in last year's hb2 identical to
 
00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:51.280 align:start position:0%
this can you confirm that mr ripple
 
00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:54.080 align:start position:0%
is that that is identical language to
 
00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:54.869 align:start position:0%
is that that is identical language to
last

00:07:54.869 --> 00:07:54.879 align:start position:0%
last
 
00:07:58.309 --> 00:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
last years or last terms um
 
00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
hb2 item isn't it it's close but not
 
00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
quite exact there was some additional
 
00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
language in the beginning that said
 
00:08:09.029 --> 00:08:09.039 align:start position:0%
except for funds appropriated in the
 
00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
operating budget
 
00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:16.629 --> 00:08:16.639 align:start position:0%
other than that the language is
 
00:08:16.639 --> 00:08:18.629 align:start position:0%
other than that the language is
identical

00:08:18.629 --> 00:08:18.639 align:start position:0%
identical
 
00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
okay so um i know that
 
00:08:26.189 --> 00:08:26.199 align:start position:0%
representative erica leone
 
00:08:29.189 --> 00:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
l-a-y-o-n i'm still not sure exactly how
 
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
to pronounce her name
 
00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:33.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:36.640 align:start position:0%

00:08:38.469 --> 00:08:38.479 align:start position:0%

00:11:29.829 --> 00:11:29.839 align:start position:0%
uses the language from previous budgets
 
00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
it is actually the in the bill it's
 
00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:34.200 align:start position:0%
actually the exact same language as the
 
00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.150 align:start position:0%
actually the exact same language as the
2017

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:36.160 align:start position:0%
2017
 
00:11:39.269 --> 00:11:39.279 align:start position:0%
house bill for the budget
 
00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
administrative rule h ew 509.07
 
00:11:45.509 --> 00:11:45.519 align:start position:0%
states that the services which shall not
 
00:11:47.829 --> 00:11:47.839 align:start position:0%
be covered as family planning or family
 
00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
planning related services
 
00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
and abortions are called out
 
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
specifically as a non-covered service
 
00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
despite solid work from previous
 
00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
previous legislative bodies family
 
00:11:58.949 --> 00:11:58.959 align:start position:0%
planning funds remain more fluid than
 
00:11:58.959 --> 00:11:59.590 align:start position:0%
planning funds remain more fluid than
intended

00:11:59.590 --> 00:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
intended
 
00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
and recipients are making the most
 
00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:02.720 align:start position:0%
efficient use of those funds that are
 
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:04.160 align:start position:0%
available and they're working right up
 
00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
to the extent of the law
 
00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
this language here is to tighten up the
 
00:12:10.069 --> 00:12:10.079 align:start position:0%
language so that no really means no
 
00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
a reproductive health care facility is
 
00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
defined in the statutes and by using
 
00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:15.200 align:start position:0%
this definition combined with the
 
00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:15.670 align:start position:0%
this definition combined with the
current

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
current
 
00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations this this simply
 
00:12:20.069 --> 00:12:20.079 align:start position:0%
sets out into law what is already in the
 
00:12:21.509 --> 00:12:21.519 align:start position:0%
administrative rules and has already
 
00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
been included in previous budgets
 
00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
this amendment just clarifies the intent
 
00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
of the original section 34
 
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
it prevents confusion of funds and it
 
00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
honors the state rules and policies so i
 
00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
ask that you adopt this amendment
 
00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:37.360 align:start position:0%

this particular amendment and how this
 
00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
particular moment has been

upheld in previous court cases including
 
00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:20.720 align:start position:0%

norton

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
norton
 
00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
yes um i just wanted to clear up any
 
00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:34.710 align:start position:0%
yes um i just wanted to clear up any
confusion

00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:34.720 align:start position:0%
confusion
 
00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
are are we open for public discussion of
 
00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:40.240 align:start position:0%
other people who were on this
 
00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
there will be an opportunity for uh
 
00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
people who are calling in
 
00:14:56.629 --> 00:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
to um to to make a short statement
 
00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
um so um
 
00:15:02.629 --> 00:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
so do you have another question well i
 
00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:04.720 align:start position:0%
just wanted you maybe to repeat
 
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
how people do that because i it was my
 
00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:10.240 align:start position:0%
understanding late last night
 
00:15:11.829 --> 00:15:11.839 align:start position:0%
that there was not going to be an
 
00:15:15.269 --> 00:15:15.279 align:start position:0%
opportunity for testimony so i just need
 
00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
to have it clarified for the public
 
00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
thank you i've never said that so i
 
00:15:20.949 --> 00:15:20.959 align:start position:0%
don't know where that came from
 
00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:24.160 align:start position:0%
uh it's always been my intent to make
 
00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:25.269 align:start position:0%
uh it's always been my intent to make
this

00:15:25.269 --> 00:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
publicly accessible and transparent
 
00:15:28.949 --> 00:15:28.959 align:start position:0%
conversation so
 
00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry that some somebody interjected
 
00:15:34.949 --> 00:15:34.959 align:start position:0%
some confusion into this
 
00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
yes yes i have a question for um
 
00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:44.720 align:start position:0%
representative leon um the state budget
 
00:15:45.509 --> 00:15:45.519 align:start position:0%
as you said
 
00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:48.320 align:start position:0%
already prevents any family planning
 
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
dollars from going towards abortion
 
00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:53.680 align:start position:0%
um and it's been a long-standing part of
 
00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:54.150 align:start position:0%
um and it's been a long-standing part of
the

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:54.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
budget and part of the practice and we
 
00:15:58.470 --> 00:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
all know that federal dollars cannot go
 
00:15:59.590 --> 00:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
towards that
 
00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:02.720 align:start position:0%
if this amendment passes it risks
 
00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
patient access to affordable birth
 
00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:06.870 align:start position:0%
patient access to affordable birth
control

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
control
 
00:16:11.189 --> 00:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
std testing and cancer screenings
 
00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:14.320 align:start position:0%
and a number of
 
00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:16.240 align:start position:0%
people that get their health care of
 
00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
women especially who get their health
 
00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:18.629 align:start position:0%
women especially who get their health
care

00:16:18.629 --> 00:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
care
 
00:16:21.829 --> 00:16:21.839 align:start position:0%
in the western part of the state would
 
00:16:21.839 --> 00:16:22.069 align:start position:0%
in the western part of the state would
be

00:16:22.069 --> 00:16:22.079 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
unable to get any of that health care
 
00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
a number of clinics that are providing
 
00:16:34.949 --> 00:16:34.959 align:start position:0%
that as i said the std testing is almost
 
00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
exclusively i believe 95 97 of the std
 
00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:39.430 align:start position:0%
exclusively i believe 95 97 of the std
testing

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
testing
 
00:16:42.629 --> 00:16:42.639 align:start position:0%
in fact is done by clinics that
 
00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
also provide abortion services so you
 
00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
close them down because it's physically
 
00:16:49.269 --> 00:16:49.279 align:start position:0%
impossible for them to
 
00:16:52.949 --> 00:16:52.959 align:start position:0%
do as you require in this i know in 2017
 
00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
in fact
 
00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
there was a senate bill that was
 
00:16:57.749 --> 00:16:57.759 align:start position:0%
defeated which was this exact same
 
00:16:57.759 --> 00:16:59.509 align:start position:0%
defeated which was this exact same
language

00:16:59.509 --> 00:16:59.519 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
so it's being recycled now so um
 
00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:04.720 align:start position:0%
what is your exact intent of this is
 
00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
your intent to in fact
 
00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
close down these clinics
 
00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:11.839 align:start position:0%
um thank you representative rogers for
 
00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
your question
 
00:17:14.549 --> 00:17:14.559 align:start position:0%
i am a financial analyst and an
 
00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
economist and i
 
00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:19.360 align:start position:0%
see how much how finances can flow from
 
00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
one section to another
 
00:17:22.549 --> 00:17:22.559 align:start position:0%
my intention is not to shut down these
 
00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:24.079 align:start position:0%
clinics my intention
 
00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
is for state funds to be used for the
 
00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
intended purpose which is family
 
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
planning services
 
00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
there has been an issue with with these
 
00:17:34.549 --> 00:17:34.559 align:start position:0%
funds going to pay for overhead and
 
00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
other issues which
 
00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:38.720 align:start position:0%
benefits the provision of abortion
 
00:17:41.029 --> 00:17:41.039 align:start position:0%
services which would otherwise
 
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
need to be be paid for by those
 
00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:44.720 align:start position:0%
non-state funds
 
00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
right now there are fun state funds that
 
00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
are going to support
 
00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
political advocacy and other issues and
 
00:17:53.029 --> 00:17:53.039 align:start position:0%
this is something where we need to have
 
00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
a clear line
 
00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
and we need to make sure that we are
 
00:17:57.909 --> 00:17:57.919 align:start position:0%
supporting these important family
 
00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
if there's an issue with some places in
 
00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:06.640 align:start position:0%
the western part of the state
 
00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
that that's i guess that's something
 
00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
that can actually probably be better
 
00:18:12.549 --> 00:18:12.559 align:start position:0%
referred to by some of the
 
00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
some of the other experts that are here
 
00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
but this is an issue where i've seen
 
00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
companies that that move these funds
 
00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
around and we need to make sure that
 
00:18:22.789 --> 00:18:22.799 align:start position:0%
it's clear because our state doesn't
 
00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
allow that funding and if you're funding
 
00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:25.190 align:start position:0%
allow that funding and if you're funding
everything

00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
everything
 
00:18:27.029 --> 00:18:27.039 align:start position:0%
up and around an abortion then that is
 
00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:28.720 align:start position:0%
not a clear use of funds and we're just
 
00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
trying to clear clear up those
 
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
definitions and make sure that
 
00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:33.440 align:start position:0%
no means no and these state funds are
 
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
appropriately allocated
 
00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
i could have a follow-up mr
 
00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:40.640 align:start position:0%
representative edwards yes ma'am
 
00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
um are you aware that the passage of
 
00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
is going to be defunding um multiple
 
00:18:49.029 --> 00:18:49.039 align:start position:0%
safety net providers for people
 
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
especially low-income peoples in around
 
00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
that in fact according to the department
 
00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
in um fiscal year 192 or
 
00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
2020 97 of the chlamydia and gonorrhea
 
00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
testing in the program
 
00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
was completed by the providers that
 
00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
you'll be closing down
 
00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
89 of the pap tests and 67 percent of
 
00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
breast exams
 
00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
were completed by these same providers
 
00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:16.720 align:start position:0%
if this amended past
 
00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
amendment passes we're going to be
 
00:19:21.029 --> 00:19:21.039 align:start position:0%
defunding safety net providers
 
00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
during a pandemic where would you have
 
00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
these patients go
 
00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
or do you just not care about the low
 
00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:28.640 align:start position:0%
income care
 
00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
preventative care low income cost
 
00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
care for preventative folks because
 
00:19:35.669 --> 00:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
you'll be leaving them
 
00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
um thank you representative rogers are
 
00:19:44.789 --> 00:19:44.799 align:start position:0%
you saying that these funds need to be
 
00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
provided to abortion providers so that
 
00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
women can get basic health services
 
00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
are you saying we need to fund that i'm
 
00:19:53.669 --> 00:19:53.679 align:start position:0%
saying that these are the providers that
 
00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
do this
 
00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
they also do provide abortions a very
 
00:19:59.430 --> 00:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
small part of what they provide
 
00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
but the way your amendment is worded
 
00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:03.440 align:start position:0%
which is the exact same thing that was
 
00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
in the federal
 
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
um law that provided was in there for
 
00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
the last few years
 
00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
and which was the same thing as a senate
 
00:20:12.789 --> 00:20:12.799 align:start position:0%
bill that was defeated
 
00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
in 2017 is in fact
 
00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
going to affect the people that provide
 
00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
same health care to low-income women in
 
00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
parts of our state
 
00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
and i gave you the statistics of the
 
00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:28.240 align:start position:0%
amount of health care they provide
 
00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
so in effect with what you thank you
 
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:20:34.149 --> 00:20:34.159 align:start position:0%
we do the thing that we have the
 
00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
statistics for
 
00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
and we have evidence that they do will
 
00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
be stopped
 
00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
for wait wait wait wait so so
 
00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
um representative rogers uh let's try to
 
00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
treat this like a
 
00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
a typical public hearing if you have a
 
00:20:53.909 --> 00:20:53.919 align:start position:0%
question to ask representative leon and
 
00:20:53.919 --> 00:20:54.310 align:start position:0%
question to ask representative leon and
then

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:20:56.789 --> 00:20:56.799 align:start position:0%
representative leon would you please uh
 
00:20:57.669 --> 00:20:57.679 align:start position:0%
wait until
 
00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
uh uh representative rogers completes
 
00:21:01.669 --> 00:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
your question
 
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
i'm trying simply to say that i've given
 
00:21:05.909 --> 00:21:05.919 align:start position:0%
her the evidence the department has
 
00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
given us
 
00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
of what these providers do do she's
 
00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
making claims without any evidence
 
00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
of what she thinks they do and let's
 
00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:16.720 align:start position:0%
that's a that's too strong uh
 
00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
representative rogers you don't know
 
00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
what her evidence
 
00:21:21.669 --> 00:21:21.679 align:start position:0%
is you're you're asking her for evidence
 
00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh which is a fair question
 
00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:26.720 align:start position:0%
but you should not assume uh
 
00:21:28.549 --> 00:21:28.559 align:start position:0%
whether she has evidence or not until
 
00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
you faster
 
00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
well do you have evidence of your claims
 
00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:33.430 align:start position:0%
well do you have evidence of your claims
and

00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
if you do would you provide it to us and
 
00:21:37.909 --> 00:21:37.919 align:start position:0%
are you aware you'll be shutting down
 
00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:40.559 align:start position:0%
providers that in fact do what the
 
00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:47.909 --> 00:21:47.919 align:start position:0%
thank you representative rogers attorney
 
00:21:50.149 --> 00:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
tyranny has some of that evidence i
 
00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:52.480 align:start position:0%
am not a lawyer i am an economist and a
 
00:21:53.909 --> 00:21:53.919 align:start position:0%
financial analyst
 
00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
i know that when i was younger i chose
 
00:21:58.149 --> 00:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
to receive my services at some of these
 
00:21:59.830 --> 00:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
providers so that i could make sure that
 
00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
my funding was going towards
 
00:22:03.669 --> 00:22:03.679 align:start position:0%
what i believe to be important services
 
00:22:05.669 --> 00:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
this is a choice that other women with
 
00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:08.240 align:start position:0%
health insurance can choose to do
 
00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:10.240 align:start position:0%
this does not necessarily defund them it
 
00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
just makes this more of a choice
 
00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
issue i would like to defer to that
 
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
evidence to rep
 
00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
to um to mr tyranny because i i worked
 
00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
more on this language and this
 
00:22:23.909 --> 00:22:23.919 align:start position:0%
clarification of use of funds
 
00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
mr tierney are you prepared to answer
 
00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
representative rogers question regarding
 
00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:29.830 align:start position:0%
representative rogers question regarding
evidence

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
00:22:33.029 --> 00:22:33.039 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um so this uh
 
00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
amendment does not defund anyone um this
 
00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:37.590 align:start position:0%
amendment does not defund anyone um this
amendment

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
just requires that any entity
 
00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
that is providing abortions
 
00:22:48.549 --> 00:22:48.559 align:start position:0%
and also wishes to receive state funds
 
00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
for other purposes such as a family
 
00:22:52.149 --> 00:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
planning project
 
00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
needs to be physically and financially
 
00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:55.669 align:start position:0%
needs to be physically and financially
separate

00:22:55.669 --> 00:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
separate
 
00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
from an abortion providing reproductive
 
00:22:59.270 --> 00:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
health facility
 
00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
the abortion providing reproductive
 
00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
health facility as defined in the
 
00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:03.909 align:start position:0%
health facility as defined in the
statute

00:23:03.909 --> 00:23:03.919 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
is just a very limited number of places
 
00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
and those places need to be physically
 
00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:11.440 align:start position:0%
and financially
 
00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
separate from an entity um
 
00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
other location that could provide other
 
00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:17.750 align:start position:0%
other location that could provide other
services

00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
the five locations that i'm aware of um
 
00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
that are defined by the statute are all
 
00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
within two miles of
 
00:23:31.909 --> 00:23:31.919 align:start position:0%
another medical clinic or of a
 
00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
hospital that does also provide a
 
00:23:40.789 --> 00:23:40.799 align:start position:0%
full set of services without providing
 
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
abortions so in manchester and concord
 
00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
in keene there are all alternate medical
 
00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:49.909 align:start position:0%
in keene there are all alternate medical
providers

00:23:49.909 --> 00:23:49.919 align:start position:0%
providers
 
00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
who are not reproductive
 
00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
health facilities as defined the
 
00:23:57.510 --> 00:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
statutes otherwise known as abortion
 
00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:00.710 align:start position:0%
statutes otherwise known as abortion
clinics

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:04.240 align:start position:0%
do you have a follow-up yes you ask for
 
00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
that to be separate which is again
 
00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:07.360 align:start position:0%
something that is
 
00:24:09.269 --> 00:24:09.279 align:start position:0%
nearly impossible for places but you
 
00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
also in this amendment
 
00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
talk about a state-funded process shall
 
00:24:15.029 --> 00:24:15.039 align:start position:0%
not encourage
 
00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
promote or advocate as a method that it
 
00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:19.110 align:start position:0%
promote or advocate as a method that it
prohibits

00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
prohibits
 
00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:22.640 align:start position:0%
them from assisting women obtaining so
 
00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
basically if any woman asks if they know
 
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
where they can obtain an abortion
 
00:24:30.789 --> 00:24:30.799 align:start position:0%
if they inquire so if they even mention
 
00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
the word
 
00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:34.400 align:start position:0%
they lose the funding i think that this
 
00:24:36.149 --> 00:24:36.159 align:start position:0%
is impossible to do
 
00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
if somebody asks you and you just deny
 
00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:40.240 align:start position:0%
them information
 
00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:42.320 align:start position:0%
that that can't be done so it's an
 
00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
impossible amendment
 
00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
and you know that this is going to cost
 
00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
them any kind of funding that they get
 
00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:52.400 align:start position:0%
right now representative rogers yes i do
 
00:24:54.149 --> 00:24:54.159 align:start position:0%
if you'd let me finish
 
00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't want this to be a debate
 
00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
i think this is where we ask
 
00:24:59.830 --> 00:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
questions and get answers well if you
 
00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
let me finish
 
00:25:03.269 --> 00:25:03.279 align:start position:0%
with this language in here mr tierney
 
00:25:05.269 --> 00:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
and this is the same language that the
 
00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
senate bill defeated
 
00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
aren't you in fact making it impossible
 
00:25:12.549 --> 00:25:12.559 align:start position:0%
for any clinic to adhere to these and
 
00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:14.480 align:start position:0%
keep their funding
 
00:25:16.789 --> 00:25:16.799 align:start position:0%
that would be incorrect um as you are
 
00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
well aware
 
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
this language is currently in federal
 
00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
regulations 42
 
00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
cfr 19
 
00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
and the current federal regulations has
 
00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
caused some abortion clinics to choose
 
00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:34.400 align:start position:0%
not to participate in the program but
 
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
other clinics have
 
00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
continued to participate in the program
 
00:25:43.669 --> 00:25:43.679 align:start position:0%
the people whose salaries are paid for
 
00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
by taxpayer dollars um are not
 
00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:49.360 align:start position:0%
pursuant to this amendment going to be
 
00:25:50.789 --> 00:25:50.799 align:start position:0%
able to advocate
 
00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
for abortion as a method of family
 
00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:54.950 align:start position:0%
for abortion as a method of family
planning

00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
planning
 
00:25:57.029 --> 00:25:57.039 align:start position:0%
and that's something that the state of
 
00:25:58.789 --> 00:25:58.799 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has the right to do
 
00:26:02.549 --> 00:26:02.559 align:start position:0%
it has the right to decide what speech
 
00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
its taxpayer dollars are paying for
 
00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
and if the amendment is adopted it's
 
00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
making a choice
 
00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:13.360 align:start position:0%
not to force the taxpayers uh to
 
00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:14.390 align:start position:0%
not to force the taxpayers uh to
subsidize

00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
subsidize
 
00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
um speech advocating for increased
 
00:26:18.789 --> 00:26:18.799 align:start position:0%
abortion access
 
00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:21.200 align:start position:0%
so you're willing to forfeit low-income
 
00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:23.360 align:start position:0%
women's health care services
 
00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
for this amendment incorrect
 
00:26:29.269 --> 00:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
low-income women's health care services
 
00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
are going to continue to be provided
 
00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:34.480 align:start position:0%
if abortion clinics decide that they
 
00:26:36.789 --> 00:26:36.799 align:start position:0%
want to continue to have
 
00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
the overhead subsidies as a family
 
00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
planning project
 
00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
they need to make sure that when their
 
00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:45.200 align:start position:0%
rent their electricity
 
00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
their other overhead expenses are being
 
00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:50.720 align:start position:0%
paid for as part of the family planning
 
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
program that they have something that is
 
00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:54.400 align:start position:0%
physically separate
 
00:26:55.909 --> 00:26:55.919 align:start position:0%
from where they are performing the
 
00:26:57.430 --> 00:26:57.440 align:start position:0%
abortions so that there's no
 
00:27:00.149 --> 00:27:00.159 align:start position:0%
indirect subsidization of those
 
00:27:00.159 --> 00:27:02.390 align:start position:0%
indirect subsidization of those
abortions

00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
abortions
 
00:27:04.149 --> 00:27:04.159 align:start position:0%
i think i heard her question to be
 
00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
something slightly different i
 
00:27:08.549 --> 00:27:08.559 align:start position:0%
i i think the essence of what she's
 
00:27:08.559 --> 00:27:09.430 align:start position:0%
i i think the essence of what she's
saying

00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
saying
 
00:27:12.549 --> 00:27:12.559 align:start position:0%
or asking is um
 
00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
do we believe that if this amendment
 
00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:16.070 align:start position:0%
do we believe that if this amendment
goes

00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
goes
 
00:27:20.389 --> 00:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
forward that there would be a gap
 
00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
in access to these services in any part
 
00:27:24.789 --> 00:27:24.799 align:start position:0%
of the state
 
00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
or are we confident that there are other
 
00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:28.310 align:start position:0%
or are we confident that there are other
providers

00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
providers
 
00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
that would be available to compete and
 
00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:31.590 align:start position:0%
that would be available to compete and
provide

00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
provide
 
00:27:35.029 --> 00:27:35.039 align:start position:0%
full statewide coverage
 
00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm very confident that there
 
00:27:38.549 --> 00:27:38.559 align:start position:0%
are other providers to provide
 
00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
all non-abortion services the
 
00:27:45.269 --> 00:27:45.279 align:start position:0%
abortion clinics are all located in a
 
00:27:47.029 --> 00:27:47.039 align:start position:0%
portion of the state
 
00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:50.320 align:start position:0%
where there are other medical providers
 
00:27:53.669 --> 00:27:53.679 align:start position:0%
manchester concord keene there are all
 
00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
medical providers within
 
00:27:58.230 --> 00:27:58.240 align:start position:0%
two miles of where there is an abortion
 
00:28:01.909 --> 00:28:01.919 align:start position:0%
clinic and an abortion clinic can choose
 
00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
to have
 
00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
a separate both physically and
 
00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
financially separate location to provide
 
00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:08.720 align:start position:0%
their non-abortion services
 
00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:11.200 align:start position:0%
and so it's not that the state would be
 
00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
defunding them
 
00:28:14.389 --> 00:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
if the abortion clinics decide to house
 
00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
all their services um
 
00:28:19.029 --> 00:28:19.039 align:start position:0%
together that is the choice that they
 
00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
representative rogers do you have a
 
00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:25.360 align:start position:0%
follow-up or another question ma'am
 
00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:27.200 align:start position:0%
um i could but i don't want to
 
00:28:30.149 --> 00:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
monopolize the conversation
 
00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions from the
 
00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:34.310 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions from the
committee

00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:37.029 --> 00:28:37.039 align:start position:0%
i i just want to clarify something mr
 
00:28:37.039 --> 00:28:37.990 align:start position:0%
i i just want to clarify something mr
tierney

00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
tierney
 
00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
uh you've used the term abortion clinic
 
00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:41.350 align:start position:0%
uh you've used the term abortion clinic
uh

00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:41.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
a few times in your answer and
 
00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
the the term in the statute is
 
00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
a reproductive health facility
 
00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
are those two terms synonymous are they
 
00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
exactly the same thing
 
00:28:58.149 --> 00:28:58.159 align:start position:0%
so i apologize abortion clinic is not a
 
00:28:59.510 --> 00:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
defined term
 
00:29:02.149 --> 00:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
a reproductive health facility is a
 
00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
defined term
 
00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
and it's defined as a clinic
 
00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
other than a hospital that provides
 
00:29:14.549 --> 00:29:14.559 align:start position:0%
services and so a reproductive health
 
00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
care facility as defined in rsa 132 37
 
00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
1 does not include any hospitals that
 
00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:23.110 align:start position:0%
1 does not include any hospitals that
may

00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
may
 
00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
you know also provide abortions in
 
00:29:27.269 --> 00:29:27.279 align:start position:0%
addition to all other
 
00:29:30.789 --> 00:29:30.799 align:start position:0%
services the hospital may provide
 
00:29:33.909 --> 00:29:33.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing hands raised by any of
 
00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:38.840 align:start position:0%
the other committee members
 
00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
um so uh mr ripple let's take a look
 
00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
at the participants i see two hands
 
00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:47.510 align:start position:0%
at the participants i see two hands
raised

00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
raised
 
00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
okay for the members of who are
 
00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:54.240 align:start position:0%
listening in uh i
 
00:29:56.389 --> 00:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
i would like all of you that would like
 
00:29:57.269 --> 00:29:57.279 align:start position:0%
to speak
 
00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:00.320 align:start position:0%
to raise your hand because we have
 
00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
uh a certain amount of time uh
 
00:30:04.389 --> 00:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
i think you have to leave now as a
 
00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
matter of fact but
 
00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
we need to finish by 10 30 because we
 
00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:12.640 align:start position:0%
have other guests
 
00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:16.480 align:start position:0%
i see four hands raised
 
00:30:19.669 --> 00:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
i would like uh to keep remarks to
 
00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
um three minutes uh
 
00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
and i would ask you to
 
00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
stick within the scope of section 34
 
00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
as introduced or within the scope
 
00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
of the amendment being proposed um
 
00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
this this is not intended to be a
 
00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
debating society
 
00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
on on whether abortions are good or not
 
00:30:47.669 --> 00:30:47.679 align:start position:0%
uh we know abortions uh are
 
00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
constitutionally medic
 
00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
constitutionally protected medical
 
00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:52.789 align:start position:0%
constitutionally protected medical
procedure

00:30:52.789 --> 00:30:52.799 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
and um and to the extent that it's a
 
00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:56.950 align:start position:0%
and um and to the extent that it's a
constitutionally

00:30:56.950 --> 00:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
constitutionally
 
00:30:59.830 --> 00:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
protected medical procedure there's
 
00:31:00.789 --> 00:31:00.799 align:start position:0%
really no
 
00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:04.720 align:start position:0%
debate for us to have it's abortion is
 
00:31:08.549 --> 00:31:08.559 align:start position:0%
an option that some people choose to
 
00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
uh take advantage of so
 
00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
representative horgan oregon i'm
 
00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna ask mr ripple to uh to allow
 
00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
you to speak
 
00:31:22.389 --> 00:31:22.399 align:start position:0%
uh i would encourage you to remember
 
00:31:24.389 --> 00:31:24.399 align:start position:0%
that as a representative
 
00:31:27.269 --> 00:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
all of us are bound by the um protocols
 
00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
of decorum
 
00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
and that in that we just agree to
 
00:31:32.789 --> 00:31:32.799 align:start position:0%
maintain decorum
 
00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
you're welcome to speak sir er good can
 
00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:41.200 align:start position:0%
you hear me
 
00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
i can thank you good i'm not i'm doing
 
00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:44.320 align:start position:0%
it on
 
00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:48.640 align:start position:0%
a laptop on the bluetooth headset so um
 
00:31:51.669 --> 00:31:51.679 align:start position:0%
i'll try to keep within decorum um
 
00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
which uh you're a i know you're a
 
00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
very fierce defender of and i was
 
00:31:59.509 --> 00:31:59.519 align:start position:0%
not expecting to speak to this i just
 
00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
want to say
 
00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
this uh it is a constitutionally
 
00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
protected procedure and
 
00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
so some young women who use these
 
00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
facilities state funding
 
00:32:13.909 --> 00:32:13.919 align:start position:0%
will choose to avail themselves of it
 
00:32:15.509 --> 00:32:15.519 align:start position:0%
not everybody in that situation
 
00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
i'm speaking as an old man so this um
 
00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
so this uh procedure is not something
 
00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
that i'm
 
00:32:25.669 --> 00:32:25.679 align:start position:0%
physically capable of having or but um
 
00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
there are young women have the
 
00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
same rights estate services as everyone
 
00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
else and also this would i
 
00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
believe effectively defund um
 
00:32:38.789 --> 00:32:38.799 align:start position:0%
many very valuable uh health care
 
00:32:40.389 --> 00:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
facilities especially uh
 
00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
specially planned especially planned
 
00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
parenthood and the other uh
 
00:32:46.549 --> 00:32:46.559 align:start position:0%
inequality health center here in concord
 
00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
so i think this is uh
 
00:32:51.029 --> 00:32:51.039 align:start position:0%
so i think this is a bad amendment and
 
00:32:52.389 --> 00:32:52.399 align:start position:0%
also it should not be handled as an
 
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
amendment it should uh
 
00:32:55.029 --> 00:32:55.039 align:start position:0%
i believe it would have been more
 
00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate to have this as a standalone
 
00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:59.029 align:start position:0%
appropriate to have this as a standalone

00:32:59.029 --> 00:32:59.039 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:00.320 align:start position:0%
so we could have a full debate in
 
00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
committee which probably would have
 
00:33:03.909 --> 00:33:03.919 align:start position:0%
led to the bill being retained and held
 
00:33:05.669 --> 00:33:05.679 align:start position:0%
over the summer so just their stickiness
 
00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
in the budget i think um
 
00:33:10.789 --> 00:33:10.799 align:start position:0%
was not not the wisest thing to do so
 
00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
uh i urge the uh committee
 
00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
to uh go back to the previous section 34
 
00:33:21.509 --> 00:33:21.519 align:start position:0%
and um and i think we'd be having a very
 
00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:23.440 align:start position:0%
debate about this if uh
 
00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
especially older men could get pregnant
 
00:33:26.549 --> 00:33:26.559 align:start position:0%
and might need abortion
 
00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
so that's um that's
 
00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
that's about all i have to say so here's
 
00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:33.200 align:start position:0%
the committee to omit this from the
 
00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:33.669 align:start position:0%
the committee to omit this from the
budget

00:33:33.669 --> 00:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:36.720 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you so much i i just want
 
00:33:39.029 --> 00:33:39.039 align:start position:0%
to react to one comment you made about
 
00:33:40.630 --> 00:33:40.640 align:start position:0%
the wisdom of this
 
00:33:43.909 --> 00:33:43.919 align:start position:0%
uh i i don't want to impugn the judgment
 
00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
of representative leon
 
00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
who has introduced this proposed
 
00:33:48.789 --> 00:33:48.799 align:start position:0%
amendment to
 
00:33:52.149 --> 00:33:52.159 align:start position:0%
hb2 uh and i would point out
 
00:33:55.269 --> 00:33:55.279 align:start position:0%
that we we are having a hearing and so
 
00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
i'll take that as an apology to
 
00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
that you didn't know it's not wise
 
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
i mean i apologize but this is a bad
 
00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
amendment and um so that's i'm not sure
 
00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:06.230 align:start position:0%
amendment and um so that's i'm not sure
how

00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:34:08.869 --> 00:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
much not sure how much more gently i
 
00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
could phrase it and i i
 
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
that was perfect that was perfect thank
 
00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:16.629 align:start position:0%
that was perfect that was perfect thank
you

00:34:16.629 --> 00:34:16.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:20.470 --> 00:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
so uh we will go i think um
 
00:34:24.869 --> 00:34:24.879 align:start position:0%
ms nelson is um up to speak next
 
00:34:27.669 --> 00:34:27.679 align:start position:0%
and ms nelson if you could try to keep
 
00:34:30.069 --> 00:34:30.079 align:start position:0%
your remarks within the contours
 
00:34:33.829 --> 00:34:33.839 align:start position:0%
of the amendment and or section
 
00:34:36.629 --> 00:34:36.639 align:start position:0%
um this isn't a debate about abortion
 
00:34:36.639 --> 00:34:37.349 align:start position:0%
um this isn't a debate about abortion
itself

00:34:37.349 --> 00:34:37.359 align:start position:0%
itself
 
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
so um please uh please go ahead and
 
00:34:42.869 --> 00:34:42.879 align:start position:0%
introduce yourself for the record and
 
00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
tell us what you think we need to know
 
00:34:46.869 --> 00:34:46.879 align:start position:0%
please thank you very much and i
 
00:34:49.589 --> 00:34:49.599 align:start position:0%
appreciate that this is not a debate
 
00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
i am my name is deborah nelson and i
 
00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
live in hanover new hampshire
 
00:34:57.510 --> 00:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
and i would agree with the previous
 
00:34:59.109 --> 00:34:59.119 align:start position:0%
speaker's remarks that this really
 
00:34:59.589 --> 00:34:59.599 align:start position:0%
should be
 
00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
handled and my
 
00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
concern is twofold one is that
 
00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
a gag rule violates medical ethics and
 
00:35:12.790 --> 00:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
standards of
 
00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
care and when i go to a doctor's office
 
00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:16.310 align:start position:0%
care and when i go to a doctor's office
it's

00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
my hope that i will be given full
 
00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:20.240 align:start position:0%
medical advice
 
00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
without concern that there is something
 
00:35:25.829 --> 00:35:25.839 align:start position:0%
being said that i shouldn't hear i
 
00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:27.440 align:start position:0%
thought it was interesting that michael
 
00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:28.710 align:start position:0%
thought it was interesting that michael
tierney

00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:28.720 align:start position:0%
tierney
 
00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
continued to refer to these clinics as
 
00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
abortion clinics and i appreciate the
 
00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
fact that you corrected him
 
00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
but he said at one point that the state
 
00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:38.390 align:start position:0%
but he said at one point that the state
has

00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
the right quote to decide what speech
 
00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:44.720 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer is willing to pay for
 
00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
and i think that a gag rule
 
00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:52.200 align:start position:0%
is way beyond what the state has the
 
00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:53.750 align:start position:0%
is way beyond what the state has the
responsibility

00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
for putting in place so i would urge the
 
00:35:58.150 --> 00:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
committee to remove
 
00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
this from the finance
 
00:36:05.349 --> 00:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
and i would urge the committee to
 
00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:08.800 align:start position:0%
take this out as i just said and leave
 
00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:10.400 align:start position:0%
it for fuller discussion
 
00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
elsewhere i have a lot more that i could
 
00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
say about this
 
00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
but i appreciate the importance of
 
00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
limiting time
 
00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
so again i think that this forces
 
00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:21.750 align:start position:0%
so again i think that this forces
providers

00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
providers
 
00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
to violate their duty to provide
 
00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
information that
 
00:36:28.069 --> 00:36:28.079 align:start position:0%
is complete accurate
 
00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
and honest to patients and it is a real
 
00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:32.230 align:start position:0%
and honest to patients and it is a real
mistake

00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:32.240 align:start position:0%
mistake
 
00:36:35.829 --> 00:36:35.839 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your
 
00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
testimony i
 
00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
i won't i uh i won't answer anything you
 
00:36:45.349 --> 00:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
said uh but i do uh appreciate you

and bi-state represents new hampshire's
 
00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
14 community health centers including
 
00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
planned parenthood and the federally
 
00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
qualified health centers that
 
00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:26.390 align:start position:0%
qualified health centers that
participate

00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
participate
 
00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
in the family planning program with dhhs
 
00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
i agree with the previous speaker ms
 
00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
nelson on the medical ethics
 
00:37:35.829 --> 00:37:35.839 align:start position:0%
issue and i also want to draw your
 
00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
attention to
 
00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
federally qualified health centers are
 
00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
funded in part by the federal government
 
00:37:48.310 --> 00:37:48.320 align:start position:0%
and they're regulated by the health
 
00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:49.589 align:start position:0%
and they're regulated by the health
services

00:37:49.589 --> 00:37:49.599 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
and resources administration they have
 
00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
a number of services that they are
 
00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:56.240 align:start position:0%
required by law to provide
 
00:37:59.349 --> 00:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
including primary care such as family
 
00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
planning services
 
00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:04.400 align:start position:0%
if they if one of their patients needs a
 
00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
service that they cannot provide
 
00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:08.320 align:start position:0%
they are required to contract for those
 
00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:10.640 align:start position:0%
services with other providers in their
 
00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
um area and they have to have these
 
00:38:16.069 --> 00:38:16.079 align:start position:0%
contracts on file when they are audited
 
00:38:19.109 --> 00:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
and when they are inspected by hersa
 
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
every three years
 
00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
they receive financial audits every year
 
00:38:27.829 --> 00:38:27.839 align:start position:0%
on line 13 i should say 12 and 13
 
00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
this amendment would prohibit them from
 
00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
entering into contracts with other
 
00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
facilities including planned parenthood
 
00:38:37.589 --> 00:38:37.599 align:start position:0%
and this is a real life example that one
 
00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
of them gave me
 
00:38:41.829 --> 00:38:41.839 align:start position:0%
if they do not typically stock larks
 
00:38:41.839 --> 00:38:42.150 align:start position:0%
if they do not typically stock larks
which

00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
are long-acting reversible contraception
 
00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
and it's because they can be expensive
 
00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
to stock if they're not
 
00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
used because they expire so oftentimes
 
00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
they will contract with
 
00:38:55.109 --> 00:38:55.119 align:start position:0%
a reproductive health facility for their
 
00:38:56.310 --> 00:38:56.320 align:start position:0%
patients to access
 
00:38:59.109 --> 00:38:59.119 align:start position:0%
larks if necessary this amendment would
 
00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
prohibit them from
 
00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
doing that and then put them in an awful
 
00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:04.720 align:start position:0%
situation with herself and the federal
 
00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:05.829 align:start position:0%
situation with herself and the federal
government

00:39:05.829 --> 00:39:05.839 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
that's one issue that i would mention
 
00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:10.160 align:start position:0%
this amendment would also
 
00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
affect a significant number of
 
00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:14.310 align:start position:0%

the new hampshire state budget of course
 
00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:06.160 align:start position:0%
would only
 
00:41:09.589 --> 00:41:09.599 align:start position:0%
apply to new hampshire tax dollars and
 
00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:11.200 align:start position:0%
where new hampshire tax dollars are
 
00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:12.230 align:start position:0%
where new hampshire tax dollars are
going

00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
going
 
00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
an entity that wants to encourage
 
00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
promote or advocate abortion does not
 
00:41:20.069 --> 00:41:20.079 align:start position:0%

new hampshire state tax dollars in order
 
00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
to pay for the salaries of people who
 
00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:24.470 align:start position:0%
to pay for the salaries of people who
are

00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:26.480 align:start position:0%
encouraging promoting or advocating for
 
00:41:28.309 --> 00:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
abortion it does not
 
00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
limit the right of anybody who is
 
00:41:35.349 --> 00:41:35.359 align:start position:0%
not receiving new hampshire state tax
 
00:41:37.109 --> 00:41:37.119 align:start position:0%
dollars as part of a family planning
 
00:41:37.119 --> 00:41:37.829 align:start position:0%
dollars as part of a family planning
program

00:41:37.829 --> 00:41:37.839 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
um from going forward and encouraging
 
00:41:41.349 --> 00:41:41.359 align:start position:0%
promoting and advocating abortion it
 
00:41:41.359 --> 00:41:42.710 align:start position:0%
promoting and advocating abortion it
just

00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
limits the use of those tax dollars
 
00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
for the promotion of abortion um are you
 
00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
able to
 
00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
address the access to the larks
 
00:41:55.589 --> 00:41:55.599 align:start position:0%
sure do you know much about that so as
 
00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
far as
 
00:42:00.829 --> 00:42:00.839 align:start position:0%
12 and 13 okay that number one has a
 
00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
perspective grammatical there's no
 
00:42:06.870 --> 00:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
family planning grantee that shall enter
 
00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:07.430 align:start position:0%
family planning grantee that shall enter
into

00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
into
 
00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:10.960 align:start position:0%
a new contract with a reproductive
 
00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
health facility
 
00:42:14.069 --> 00:42:14.079 align:start position:0%
those entities that have current
 
00:42:15.589 --> 00:42:15.599 align:start position:0%
contracts for larks
 
00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
would not be impacted uh by this
 
00:42:19.829 --> 00:42:19.839 align:start position:0%
particular provision
 
00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
that would just be um going forward for
 
00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
those new contracts
 
00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
i don't want to put words in your mouth
 
00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:28.640 align:start position:0%
mr tierney but i but i think
 
00:42:30.309 --> 00:42:30.319 align:start position:0%
what you just said is there that there
 
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
is a long-term issue potentially
 
00:42:35.829 --> 00:42:35.839 align:start position:0%
about the uh ability of a family
 
00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:38.240 align:start position:0%
planning clinic to access larps
 
00:42:42.550 --> 00:42:42.560 align:start position:0%
if mr chairman may i respond please
 
00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:45.839 align:start position:0%
no not until you're recognized okay
 
00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
thank you so to clarify your
 
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
your statement um in future if
 
00:42:56.470 --> 00:42:56.480 align:start position:0%
a family planning grantee needed to get
 
00:42:58.230 --> 00:42:58.240 align:start position:0%
larks from somewhere
 
00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:00.160 align:start position:0%
they would need to enter into a contract
 
00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
to get them from somewhere other
 
00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
than an abortion providing reproductive
 
00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
health facility
 
00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
but that would not be immediate on an
 
00:43:09.109 --> 00:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
existing contract
 
00:43:11.109 --> 00:43:11.119 align:start position:0%
only be for new contracts so there would
 
00:43:12.150 --> 00:43:12.160 align:start position:0%
be time to
 
00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
find out whether they get them from
 
00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
dartmouth hitchcock
 
00:43:18.550 --> 00:43:18.560 align:start position:0%
or some other provider
 
00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:24.640 align:start position:0%
that is not a 132-37 provider
 
00:43:26.230 --> 00:43:26.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for your answer and thank you
 
00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:28.160 align:start position:0%
for keeping it relatively short
 
00:43:32.069 --> 00:43:32.079 align:start position:0%
so uh miss stoddard was that you who
 
00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
had another comment go ahead thank you
 
00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:35.270 align:start position:0%
had another comment go ahead thank you
sir

00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
sir
 
00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
um i am an attorney and our health
 
00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
centers fqhcs i am not their attorney
 
00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
however they consulted with their legal
 
00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:44.150 align:start position:0%
however they consulted with their legal
counsel

00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
counsel
 
00:43:45.910 --> 00:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
and our national association of
 
00:43:47.349 --> 00:43:47.359 align:start position:0%
community health centers that they all
 
00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
belong to
 
00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
and that bi-state belongs to and their
 
00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:51.750 align:start position:0%
and that bi-state belongs to and their
auditors

00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
auditors
 
00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
they cannot currently participate in the
 
00:43:56.069 --> 00:43:56.079 align:start position:0%
title 10 program
 
00:43:59.430 --> 00:43:59.440 align:start position:0%
because of this gag rule which is almost
 
00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
identical to the one that you're looking
 
00:44:01.829 --> 00:44:01.839 align:start position:0%
at now
 
00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
that attorney tierney rep mentioned
 
00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
if this were to go into place those
 
00:44:09.349 --> 00:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
fqhcs would likely
 
00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
be in the same situation and they could
 
00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
not participate
 
00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
in the family planning program i
 
00:44:15.910 --> 00:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:18.640 align:start position:0%
the word shall enter is prospective but
 
00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
their contracts
 
00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
expire with all due respect they expire
 
00:44:26.069 --> 00:44:26.079 align:start position:0%
and this will increase their ability i i
 
00:44:27.589 --> 00:44:27.599 align:start position:0%
agree with that we we only have
 
00:44:29.829 --> 00:44:29.839 align:start position:0%
about 15 more minutes and we have three
 
00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
more people so i i think
 
00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
i think you've added your point to the
 
00:44:36.550 --> 00:44:36.560 align:start position:0%
record thank you so much
 
00:44:39.829 --> 00:44:39.839 align:start position:0%

00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
one going back earlier to the um the
 
00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:10.720 align:start position:0%
professional advice the the dangers of
 
00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
limiting that
 
00:45:13.349 --> 00:45:13.359 align:start position:0%
as a practicing attorney in new
 
00:45:15.829 --> 00:45:15.839 align:start position:0%
hampshire the only restriction i know on
 
00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
my right
 
00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
to advise my clients to a variety of
 
00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:21.349 align:start position:0%
to advise my clients to a variety of
options

00:45:21.349 --> 00:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
options
 
00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
is criminal activity i cannot engage and
 
00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
counsel them in criminal activity
 
00:45:28.069 --> 00:45:28.079 align:start position:0%
and so since abortion is not criminal
 
00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
activity i think that we're really
 
00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
uh it's dangerous to take a medical
 
00:45:33.670 --> 00:45:33.680 align:start position:0%
professional and eliminate any type of
 
00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
options that they might feel is
 
00:45:37.510 --> 00:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate to talk to their clients
 
00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:38.390 align:start position:0%
appropriate to talk to their clients
about

00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:45:40.870 --> 00:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
and then number two um my um you know
 
00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
the the sponsor
 
00:45:44.950 --> 00:45:44.960 align:start position:0%
um our colleague from derry i think she
 
00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
actually really
 
00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:48.640 align:start position:0%
said what i want to say about this bill
 
00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
and what i'd like you to remember
 
00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
she said that these clinics are going
 
00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
right up to the edge of the law
 
00:45:59.670 --> 00:45:59.680 align:start position:0%
the law is that no funds no state or
 
00:45:59.680 --> 00:45:59.990 align:start position:0%
the law is that no funds no state or
federal

00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
federal
 
00:46:03.109 --> 00:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
funds can be provided for abortion
 
00:46:03.119 --> 00:46:03.990 align:start position:0%
funds can be provided for abortion
services

00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
and they're not this law takes it over
 
00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
the edge
 
00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
um and i i so i really asked you to
 
00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
recall that
 
00:46:13.829 --> 00:46:13.839 align:start position:0%
i know this is a controversial issue and
 
00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
people are looking to try to push their
 
00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:22.309 --> 00:46:22.319 align:start position:0%
please don't imply motive or or
 
00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
intention to
 
00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
your opposition just represent your own
 
00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
position please
 
00:46:30.790 --> 00:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
i i apologize i didn't realize that i
 
00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
was doing that i was
 
00:46:33.910 --> 00:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
recognizing the controversials of the
 
00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
issue and i was quoting um my colleague
 
00:46:37.589 --> 00:46:37.599 align:start position:0%
who i respect
 
00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
that she had said that um the current
 
00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
uh funding sources what i mean the
 
00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
certain clinics are using the funding
 
00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
right up to the edge of the law
 
00:46:48.550 --> 00:46:48.560 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much for the time to
 
00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:49.910 align:start position:0%

00:46:53.109 --> 00:46:53.119 align:start position:0%
all right uh well thank you um that was
 
00:46:55.349 --> 00:46:55.359 align:start position:0%
under two minutes and i appreciate you
 
00:46:57.670 --> 00:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
uh testifying today
 
00:47:02.150 --> 00:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
um i i think the next person to have
 
00:47:03.109 --> 00:47:03.119 align:start position:0%
raised their hand
 
00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
was miss kayla montgomery could you
 
00:47:08.150 --> 00:47:08.160 align:start position:0%

00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
and and share with us what you know
 
00:47:14.550 --> 00:47:14.560 align:start position:0%
or think sure um good morning mr
 
00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:16.240 align:start position:0%
chairman members of the committee
 
00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
my name is caleb montgomery i'm the
 
00:47:19.349 --> 00:47:19.359 align:start position:0%
director of public affairs for planned
 
00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:20.720 align:start position:0%
parenthood of northern new england and
 
00:47:21.349 --> 00:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
planned parenthood
 
00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
interaction fund and we strongly oppose
 
00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
this amendment because it is a gag rule
 
00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
on safety net providers
 
00:47:29.589 --> 00:47:29.599 align:start position:0%
a gag rule prevents health care
 
00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
organizations that receive
 
00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
government funds from mentioning or
 
00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:34.160 align:start position:0%
providing education
 
00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
consultation or referrals for abortion
 
00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment interferes with
 
00:47:40.549 --> 00:47:40.559 align:start position:0%
patient-provided relationships
 
00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
and would force providers to violate
 
00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
their duty
 
00:47:45.990 --> 00:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
to provide information that is complete
 
00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
accurate and honest to patients
 
00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:50.720 align:start position:0%
or being funded this amendment is
 
00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
identical to the trump administration's
 
00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
gag role and when that was implemented
 
00:47:56.870 --> 00:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
in 2019 a majority of new hampshire
 
00:47:58.630 --> 00:47:58.640 align:start position:0%
titles and providers pulled out of the
 
00:47:58.640 --> 00:47:59.270 align:start position:0%
titles and providers pulled out of the
program

00:47:59.270 --> 00:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
rather than comply with medically
 
00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:02.720 align:start position:0%
unethical rules
 
00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
therefore it is safe to assume that if
 
00:48:05.990 --> 00:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
this amendment passes
 
00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
the majority of title 10 providers
 
00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:09.440 align:start position:0%
including those who don't perform
 
00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:10.069 align:start position:0%
including those who don't perform
abortion

00:48:10.069 --> 00:48:10.079 align:start position:0%
abortion
 
00:48:11.750 --> 00:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
would again be forced to pull out of
 
00:48:13.589 --> 00:48:13.599 align:start position:0%
state funding rather than lie to their
 
00:48:13.599 --> 00:48:14.870 align:start position:0%
state funding rather than lie to their
patients

00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
patients
 
00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
while the federal gag rule is expected
 
00:48:18.549 --> 00:48:18.559 align:start position:0%
to be reversed there are no timelines
 
00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
available yet
 
00:48:22.549 --> 00:48:22.559 align:start position:0%
so passage of this amendment means that
 
00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
providers wouldn't be able to receive
 
00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:24.880 align:start position:0%
state or
 
00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
federal funds which of course is funding
 
00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:28.720 align:start position:0%
that these organizations rely on to
 
00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:29.109 align:start position:0%
that these organizations rely on to
provide

00:48:29.109 --> 00:48:29.119 align:start position:0%
provide
 
00:48:31.670 --> 00:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
quality and affordable care to granite
 
00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:32.710 align:start position:0%
quality and affordable care to granite
staters

00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:32.720 align:start position:0%
staters
 
00:48:35.190 --> 00:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
so to be perfectly clear this will
 
00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:36.230 align:start position:0%
so to be perfectly clear this will
defund

00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
defund
 
00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
health centers during a pandemic this
 
00:48:40.309 --> 00:48:40.319 align:start position:0%
imposes totally
 
00:48:42.390 --> 00:48:42.400 align:start position:0%
unnecessary physical separation
 
00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
requirements which are
 
00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
completely impossible to comply with and
 
00:48:47.990 --> 00:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
these requirements serve
 
00:48:50.470 --> 00:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
absolutely no logical purpose and are
 
00:48:51.910 --> 00:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
only designed to force planned
 
00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
parenthood and other health centers that
 
00:48:54.790 --> 00:48:54.800 align:start position:0%
provide abortion
 
00:48:57.349 --> 00:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
out of operation but if passed it will
 
00:48:58.549 --> 00:48:58.559 align:start position:0%
have a dramatic
 
00:49:01.109 --> 00:49:01.119 align:start position:0%
drastic and immediate effect across our
 
00:49:02.470 --> 00:49:02.480 align:start position:0%
state for patients who are most
 
00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:03.670 align:start position:0%
state for patients who are most
vulnerable

00:49:03.670 --> 00:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
vulnerable
 
00:49:05.109 --> 00:49:05.119 align:start position:0%
and i also want to say for the record
 
00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
that government funds can never go to
 
00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
abortion care
 
00:49:10.950 --> 00:49:10.960 align:start position:0%
patients must use private insurance or
 
00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
self-pay for abortion
 
00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
all funds are completely segregated and
 
00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
funds are never commingled
 
00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
c4 advocacy is also not commingled for
 
00:49:21.109 --> 00:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
example ppn
 
00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:22.800 align:start position:0%
e has a sister organization called
 
00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
planned parenthood new hampshire action
 
00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:24.710 align:start position:0%
planned parenthood new hampshire action
fund

00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
which is a c4 organization
 
00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:28.960 align:start position:0%
planned parenthood of northern new
 
00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
england has 21 health centers in maine
 
00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
vermont new hampshire and is a trusted
 
00:49:34.870 --> 00:49:34.880 align:start position:0%
reliable source of compassionate and
 
00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
affordable health care
 
00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:45.829 --> 00:49:45.839 align:start position:0%
30 seconds okay i will skip ahead um
 
00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
i just also want to mention that someone
 
00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
said that
 
00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
uh folks could go to alternative medical
 
00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:52.470 align:start position:0%
uh folks could go to alternative medical
providers

00:49:52.470 --> 00:49:52.480 align:start position:0%
providers
 
00:49:54.390 --> 00:49:54.400 align:start position:0%
that was mentioned by the sponsor all
 
00:49:55.750 --> 00:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
know that those providers
 
00:49:58.950 --> 00:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
don't care for people on a sliding scale
 
00:50:03.030 --> 00:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
which is often no cost in 2020
 
00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:04.240 align:start position:0%
planned parenthood northern new england
 
00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
provided 2.4 million in free or
 
00:50:08.150 --> 00:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
discounted care to our most vulnerable
 
00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:09.109 align:start position:0%
discounted care to our most vulnerable
citizens

00:50:09.109 --> 00:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
00:50:11.430 --> 00:50:11.440 align:start position:0%
and i also want to point out that the
 
00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
sponsor mentioned
 
00:50:15.990 --> 00:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
that this is an identical um
 
00:50:18.950 --> 00:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
this is identical amendment to a an item
 
00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
back in 2017 but what the sponsor didn't
 
00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
mention is that
 
00:50:25.750 --> 00:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
that amendment was soundly defeated um
 
00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
because it is bad for public health
 
00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:28.230 align:start position:0%
because it is bad for public health
outcomes

00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:28.240 align:start position:0%
outcomes
 
00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
so i okay i just urge you all to stand
 
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:50:34.230 --> 00:50:34.240 align:start position:0%
hundreds of medical organizations and
 
00:50:36.390 --> 00:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
providers and public health officials
 
00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:38.720 align:start position:0%
who oppose gag rules like these and
 
00:50:40.710 --> 00:50:40.720 align:start position:0%
please just defeat this amendment and
 
00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
if time i would love to talk about the
 
00:50:43.829 --> 00:50:43.839 align:start position:0%
large issue thank you very much
 
00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
i appreciate it so representative
 
00:50:48.069 --> 00:50:48.079 align:start position:0%
wallner i i apologize i've been looking
 
00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
at the attendees and you've
 
00:50:50.790 --> 00:50:50.800 align:start position:0%
i don't know how long you've had your
 
00:50:53.109 --> 00:50:53.119 align:start position:0%
hand up uh do you represent waller do
 
00:50:54.790 --> 00:50:54.800 align:start position:0%
you have a question or
 
00:50:57.510 --> 00:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
or a pertinent comment here that you you
 
00:50:58.790 --> 00:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
want to make
 
00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
well you know actually i think that um
 
00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
ms montgomery is the right
 
00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:04.720 align:start position:0%
is probably the person i should be
 
00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
asking this question of
 
00:51:08.230 --> 00:51:08.240 align:start position:0%
could you just tell me how this would
 
00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:09.270 align:start position:0%
could you just tell me how this would
affect

00:51:09.270 --> 00:51:09.280 align:start position:0%
affect
 
00:51:13.190 --> 00:51:13.200 align:start position:0%
um hospitals would this have an effect
 
00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
on our
 
00:51:17.109 --> 00:51:17.119 align:start position:0%
our hospitals it would have an effect on
 
00:51:18.870 --> 00:51:18.880 align:start position:0%
hospitals who are in the title 10
 
00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:19.829 align:start position:0%
hospitals who are in the title 10
program

00:51:19.829 --> 00:51:19.839 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:51:22.069 --> 00:51:22.079 align:start position:0%
um which i believe there are a few and
 
00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
so yeah it would
 
00:51:25.270 --> 00:51:25.280 align:start position:0%
would mean that they wouldn't be
 
00:51:27.349 --> 00:51:27.359 align:start position:0%
eligible for state funding
 
00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
so it's my understanding that this uh
 
00:51:31.829 --> 00:51:31.839 align:start position:0%
legislation is strictly targeting
 
00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
reproductive health clinics and in the
 
00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
new hampshire rsas
 
00:51:39.430 --> 00:51:39.440 align:start position:0%
that's defined pretty clearly as
 
00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh as not being hospitals so it's
 
00:51:45.270 --> 00:51:45.280 align:start position:0%
not being an attorney it's it's my
 
00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:46.470 align:start position:0%
not being an attorney it's it's my
understanding

00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
that it wouldn't affect hospitals at all
 
00:51:51.990 --> 00:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
even those that do provide abortion
 
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:53.109 align:start position:0%
even those that do provide abortion
services

00:51:53.109 --> 00:51:53.119 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
which are can oftentimes be essential to
 
00:51:58.309 --> 00:51:58.319 align:start position:0%
saving the life of a mother so
 
00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
so i i don't know that that can you
 
00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
could you clarify
 
00:52:04.549 --> 00:52:04.559 align:start position:0%
whether you really think it's hospitals
 
00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:06.160 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
because uh online let's see what is it
 
00:52:11.670 --> 00:52:11.680 align:start position:0%
line uh 18 it talks about promotion
 
00:52:13.109 --> 00:52:13.119 align:start position:0%
referral or support of abortion as a
 
00:52:14.549 --> 00:52:14.559 align:start position:0%
method of family planning
 
00:52:17.190 --> 00:52:17.200 align:start position:0%
so if someone if a title 10 provider who
 
00:52:18.870 --> 00:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
happens to be a hospital
 
00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:20.720 align:start position:0%
uh if a patient comes in and they do not
 
00:52:22.150 --> 00:52:22.160 align:start position:0%
want to be they are pregnant and they do
 
00:52:23.349 --> 00:52:23.359 align:start position:0%
not want to be pregnant
 
00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
then that would say that the provide the
 
00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:26.630 align:start position:0%
then that would say that the provide the
hospital

00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
00:52:28.549 --> 00:52:28.559 align:start position:0%
couldn't give medically accurate care to
 
00:52:30.390 --> 00:52:30.400 align:start position:0%
that patient all right
 
00:52:32.230 --> 00:52:32.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for the clarification i i
 
00:52:33.589 --> 00:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
think i think that there's an
 
00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
interpretation difference
 
00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:38.240 align:start position:0%
is all uh but i do appreciate um
 
00:52:40.950 --> 00:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
your opinion on it thank you thank you
 
00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:41.270 align:start position:0%
your opinion on it thank you thank you
uh

00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:52:43.829 --> 00:52:43.839 align:start position:0%
representative um waller did you have a
 
00:52:43.839 --> 00:52:44.950 align:start position:0%
representative um waller did you have a
follow-up

00:52:44.950 --> 00:52:44.960 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:52:48.069 --> 00:52:48.079 align:start position:0%
no i just i was just curious as to how
 
00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:50.640 align:start position:0%
this would um affect hospitals and i
 
00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:51.589 align:start position:0%
this would um affect hospitals and i
think

00:52:51.589 --> 00:52:51.599 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:52:54.390 --> 00:52:54.400 align:start position:0%
um i heard from miss montgomery that it
 
00:52:59.430 --> 00:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
would affect them thank you at
 
00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
line four of the amendment and uh this
 
00:53:04.069 --> 00:53:04.079 align:start position:0%
bill is pertaining to reproductive
 
00:53:04.079 --> 00:53:04.470 align:start position:0%
bill is pertaining to reproductive
health

00:53:04.470 --> 00:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
health
 
00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
care facilities as defined in rsa 132 to
 
00:53:11.030 --> 00:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
colon 37 and i i think
 
00:53:13.270 --> 00:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
that's the limitation of the scope of
 
00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:14.240 align:start position:0%
the impact
 
00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
of this amendment but i'm not a lawyer
 
00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
okay to be clear so we're going to
 
00:53:25.589 --> 00:53:25.599 align:start position:0%
move on if you have additional
 
00:53:25.599 --> 00:53:27.589 align:start position:0%
move on if you have additional
commentary

00:53:27.589 --> 00:53:27.599 align:start position:0%

doors and campaigning uh
 
00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
the overwhelming feeling of the people
 
00:54:10.710 --> 00:54:10.720 align:start position:0%
of derry is no money for
 
00:54:13.030 --> 00:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
for reproductive health care facilities
 
00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
uh they they do not want to have
 
00:54:16.950 --> 00:54:16.960 align:start position:0%
any anything to do with funding abortion
 
00:54:17.910 --> 00:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
this um
 
00:54:19.750 --> 00:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
this amendment will will open up bidding
 
00:54:21.510 --> 00:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
for for starters i haven't heard anybody
 
00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:21.829 align:start position:0%
for for starters i haven't heard anybody
uh

00:54:21.829 --> 00:54:21.839 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:54:23.829 --> 00:54:23.839 align:start position:0%
mention that there'll be much more
 
00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
bidding uh by
 
00:54:27.349 --> 00:54:27.359 align:start position:0%
by healthcare facilities uh to to help
 
00:54:28.950 --> 00:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
the the poor and indigent
 
00:54:31.589 --> 00:54:31.599 align:start position:0%
of our our state it'll give the uh give
 
00:54:32.790 --> 00:54:32.800 align:start position:0%
the state um
 
00:54:34.870 --> 00:54:34.880 align:start position:0%
you know a better break that the
 
00:54:36.069 --> 00:54:36.079 align:start position:0%
business would be better
 
00:54:38.309 --> 00:54:38.319 align:start position:0%
uh more more providers uh you know
 
00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
cheaper services for
 
00:54:43.589 --> 00:54:43.599 align:start position:0%
the for the state and um you know the uh
 
00:54:47.109 --> 00:54:47.119 align:start position:0%
as far as uh uh you know limiting
 
00:54:49.589 --> 00:54:49.599 align:start position:0%
uh you know the the the reproductive
 
00:54:51.990 --> 00:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
health care uh facilities now and uh you
 
00:54:53.349 --> 00:54:53.359 align:start position:0%
know what they can do
 
00:54:55.829 --> 00:54:55.839 align:start position:0%
um the i i always like to refer to the
 
00:54:56.470 --> 00:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
billing as
 
00:54:59.349 --> 00:54:59.359 align:start position:0%
a big problem uh you know when you when
 
00:55:01.750 --> 00:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
you're allowed to co-mingle funds
 
00:55:04.309 --> 00:55:04.319 align:start position:0%
uh you could uh a bill could possibly
 
00:55:04.319 --> 00:55:04.789 align:start position:0%
uh you could uh a bill could possibly
read

00:55:04.789 --> 00:55:04.799 align:start position:0%
read
 
00:55:06.150 --> 00:55:06.160 align:start position:0%
and there'd be nothing stopping them
 
00:55:08.390 --> 00:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
from doing this uh your initial phone
 
00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:09.030 align:start position:0%
from doing this uh your initial phone
call

00:55:09.030 --> 00:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
call
 
00:55:11.030 --> 00:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh to to a reproductive health care
 
00:55:13.030 --> 00:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
center uh 200
 
00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:16.240 align:start position:0%
you know uh initial office visit 250
 
00:55:18.390 --> 00:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
medication 300 and look at that the
 
00:55:20.309 --> 00:55:20.319 align:start position:0%
abortion only costs 30 bucks
 
00:55:23.030 --> 00:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
um you know in in reality the the the
 
00:55:24.549 --> 00:55:24.559 align:start position:0%
state is paying for the abortion
 
00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:27.200 align:start position:0%
it's there's nothing to prevent that uh
 
00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:55:29.589 --> 00:55:29.599 align:start position:0%
uh you know that that's the way our laws
 
00:55:32.549 --> 00:55:32.559 align:start position:0%
are if this amendment is adopted uh the
 
00:55:34.390 --> 00:55:34.400 align:start position:0%
the poor and indigent people the people
 
00:55:35.910 --> 00:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
that really need this this funding
 
00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
uh will be served much better uh
 
00:55:39.829 --> 00:55:39.839 align:start position:0%
there'll be no co-mingling of funds
 
00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:40.480 align:start position:0%
there'll no be
 
00:55:42.150 --> 00:55:42.160 align:start position:0%
there'll be no big executives uh
 
00:55:44.710 --> 00:55:44.720 align:start position:0%
salaries uh uh being paid for by our
 
00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:45.190 align:start position:0%
salaries uh uh being paid for by our
state

00:55:45.190 --> 00:55:45.200 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:55:46.870 --> 00:55:46.880 align:start position:0%
state funding uh there'll be no
 
00:55:48.950 --> 00:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
lobbyists being paid for by one
 
00:55:52.549 --> 00:55:52.559 align:start position:0%
thing and uh you know that
 
00:55:55.270 --> 00:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
like i said i'm i mean wholehearted uh

morning um representative edwards for

the record paula minihan state
 
00:56:23.430 --> 00:56:23.440 align:start position:0%
government relations um
 
00:56:24.870 --> 00:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
for the new hampshire hospital
 
00:56:26.470 --> 00:56:26.480 align:start position:0%
association i
 
00:56:31.030 --> 00:56:31.040 align:start position:0%
um just wanted to make sure that um
 
00:56:33.589 --> 00:56:33.599 align:start position:0%
that you understand and i just wanted to
 
00:56:33.599 --> 00:56:34.309 align:start position:0%
that you understand and i just wanted to
confirm

00:56:34.309 --> 00:56:34.319 align:start position:0%
confirm
 
00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
what um ms montgomery said that some of
 
00:56:38.630 --> 00:56:38.640 align:start position:0%
the hospitals the way we
 
00:56:40.950 --> 00:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
interpret this language and that this is
 
00:56:42.789 --> 00:56:42.799 align:start position:0%
the first i'm actually seeing this
 
00:56:46.789 --> 00:56:46.799 align:start position:0%
um but the way i um previously
 
00:56:49.510 --> 00:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
understood the gag rule um that yes some
 
00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:50.390 align:start position:0%
understood the gag rule um that yes some
hospitals

00:56:50.390 --> 00:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
hospitals
 
00:56:53.589 --> 00:56:53.599 align:start position:0%
with title 10 funding would in fact be
 
00:56:56.549 --> 00:56:56.559 align:start position:0%
impacted by this i think this raises a
 
00:56:56.559 --> 00:56:57.190 align:start position:0%
impacted by this i think this raises a
larger

00:56:57.190 --> 00:56:57.200 align:start position:0%
larger
 
00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
issue um that was raised earlier that
 
00:57:00.870 --> 00:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
this really
 
00:57:04.390 --> 00:57:04.400 align:start position:0%
um is is kind of a complex issue and i
 
00:57:05.750 --> 00:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
think it deserves um
 
00:57:08.069 --> 00:57:08.079 align:start position:0%
separate discussion and a separate
 
00:57:08.079 --> 00:57:09.030 align:start position:0%
separate discussion and a separate
hearing

00:57:09.030 --> 00:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:57:11.750 --> 00:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
i was not prepared to testify today at
 
00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:12.150 align:start position:0%
i was not prepared to testify today at
all

00:57:12.150 --> 00:57:12.160 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:14.240 align:start position:0%
um again this is the first i'm seeing
 
00:57:16.309 --> 00:57:16.319 align:start position:0%
this but i just want i know the
 
00:57:18.150 --> 00:57:18.160 align:start position:0%
um representative walner asked if
 
00:57:19.829 --> 00:57:19.839 align:start position:0%
hospitals are impacted
 
00:57:22.390 --> 00:57:22.400 align:start position:0%
i am not a lawyer but others that have
 
00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:23.270 align:start position:0%
i am not a lawyer but others that have
testified

00:57:23.270 --> 00:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
testified
 
00:57:26.390 --> 00:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
are um and i do believe though from
 
00:57:28.789 --> 00:57:28.799 align:start position:0%
talking with others in the past
 
00:57:31.510 --> 00:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
that yes hospitals would be impacted
 
00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:32.230 align:start position:0%
that yes hospitals would be impacted
furthermore

00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
furthermore
 
00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:34.240 align:start position:0%
i'm just concerned about the access to
 
00:57:35.349 --> 00:57:35.359 align:start position:0%
care for
 
00:57:37.750 --> 00:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
our most vulnerable especially during
 
00:57:39.030 --> 00:57:39.040 align:start position:0%
the pandemic
 
00:57:42.069 --> 00:57:42.079 align:start position:0%
and what this potentially could do
 
00:57:45.589 --> 00:57:45.599 align:start position:0%
to impact that access which we are
 
00:57:48.150 --> 00:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
very concerned about and would not want
 
00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
to see
 
00:57:51.829 --> 00:57:51.839 align:start position:0%
any access be limited for
 
00:57:55.190 --> 00:57:55.200 align:start position:0%
important services to to our um
 
00:57:58.230 --> 00:57:58.240 align:start position:0%
citizens in new hampshire so um and i i
 
00:57:59.030 --> 00:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
am sure
 
00:58:03.589 --> 00:58:03.599 align:start position:0%
um that the the clinics um that provide
 
00:58:05.990 --> 00:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
family planning services because they
 
00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
receive federal funding
 
00:58:10.789 --> 00:58:10.799 align:start position:0%
are subject to audits um so i am sure
 
00:58:11.829 --> 00:58:11.839 align:start position:0%
that they
 
00:58:13.910 --> 00:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
have gone through those audits and i'm
 
00:58:16.230 --> 00:58:16.240 align:start position:0%
sure ms montgomery and others could
 
00:58:18.549 --> 00:58:18.559 align:start position:0%
address that but again due to limited
 
00:58:19.990 --> 00:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
time um
 
00:58:22.710 --> 00:58:22.720 align:start position:0%
i will stop my comments but happy i will
 
00:58:24.549 --> 00:58:24.559 align:start position:0%
stay on if anyone has any questions
 
00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:58:29.990 --> 00:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um i i
 
00:58:33.109 --> 00:58:33.119 align:start position:0%
i think to your point about not not
 
00:58:34.710 --> 00:58:34.720 align:start position:0%
having had an opportunity to fully
 
00:58:36.710 --> 00:58:36.720 align:start position:0%
prepare for today
 
00:58:40.630 --> 00:58:40.640 align:start position:0%
i think you have a valid point
 
00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
the hb2 process is
 
00:58:47.030 --> 00:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
inherently less transparent than
 
00:58:49.510 --> 00:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
our normal procedures for policy
 
00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:50.470 align:start position:0%
our normal procedures for policy
committees

00:58:50.470 --> 00:58:50.480 align:start position:0%
committees
 
00:58:53.670 --> 00:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
which is why i've made an effort to
 
00:58:56.390 --> 00:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
get the amendment out there uh in the
 
00:58:57.910 --> 00:58:57.920 align:start position:0%
most public way i could
 
00:59:00.710 --> 00:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
and to you know alert particular
 
00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:01.510 align:start position:0%
and to you know alert particular
individuals

00:59:01.510 --> 00:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
00:59:03.030 --> 00:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
with interest that i need to have
 
00:59:04.870 --> 00:59:04.880 align:start position:0%
interest in the subject to invite them
 
00:59:06.950 --> 00:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
to come participate
 
00:59:09.910 --> 00:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
um and so so and we're holding this
 
00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:10.470 align:start position:0%
um and so so and we're holding this
hearing

00:59:10.470 --> 00:59:10.480 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:59:13.510 --> 00:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
or meeting like a hearing in order to
 
00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
um to at least leverage some of the
 
00:59:17.349 --> 00:59:17.359 align:start position:0%
policy committee procedures
 
00:59:20.549 --> 00:59:20.559 align:start position:0%
so if if um to your concern about not
 
00:59:22.549 --> 00:59:22.559 align:start position:0%
having enough time to prepare one or two
 
00:59:25.510 --> 00:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
things will happen we're either going to
 
00:59:29.109 --> 00:59:29.119 align:start position:0%
vote this amendment down in which case
 
00:59:33.270 --> 00:59:33.280 align:start position:0%
you your testimony uh was sufficient
 
00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
or if we pass it uh you have another
 
00:59:37.190 --> 00:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
bite at the apple
 
00:59:40.789 --> 00:59:40.799 align:start position:0%
uh when the senate looks at their hb2 so
 
00:59:42.630 --> 00:59:42.640 align:start position:0%
i think we're i think we're in midstream
 
00:59:44.069 --> 00:59:44.079 align:start position:0%
of a conversation
 
00:59:48.470 --> 00:59:48.480 align:start position:0%
at this point so um
 
00:59:51.910 --> 00:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
mr i i see panelists
 
00:59:54.549 --> 00:59:54.559 align:start position:0%
let's see what's going on over here uh
 
00:59:56.230 --> 00:59:56.240 align:start position:0%
representative norgren
 
01:00:00.069 --> 01:00:00.079 align:start position:0%
you have your hand up
 
01:00:02.710 --> 01:00:02.720 align:start position:0%
probably this is out of turn but i think
 
01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
the comments that have been made
 
01:00:07.829 --> 01:00:07.839 align:start position:0%
um make it even more obvious that this
 
01:00:09.109 --> 01:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
bill should have
 
01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
its own hearing in the health human
 
01:00:12.630 --> 01:00:12.640 align:start position:0%
services committee
 
01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:14.640 align:start position:0%
so i hope that's something the committee
 
01:00:15.750 --> 01:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
will consider
 
01:00:19.109 --> 01:00:19.119 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you and um
 
01:00:22.470 --> 01:00:22.480 align:start position:0%
mr tierney i see your hand is up and
 
01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:26.720 align:start position:0%
i would ask you sir um to if you
 
01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
in your coming remarks that you just
 
01:00:31.030 --> 01:00:31.040 align:start position:0%
addressed very specific things that
 
01:00:31.750 --> 01:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
you've heard
 
01:00:34.150 --> 01:00:34.160 align:start position:0%
uh so that the committee has the
 
01:00:37.670 --> 01:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
information it needs to make a decision
 
01:00:40.230 --> 01:00:40.240 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you um so as it
 
01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
pertains to the
 
01:00:45.349 --> 01:00:45.359 align:start position:0%
impact of this language on hospitals
 
01:00:47.829 --> 01:00:47.839 align:start position:0%
what is currently the case right now in
 
01:00:49.430 --> 01:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
the 2021
 
01:00:51.510 --> 01:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
is that there is one hospital concord
 
01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
hospital that is participating
 
01:00:57.589 --> 01:00:57.599 align:start position:0%
in the um family planning program
 
01:01:00.309 --> 01:01:00.319 align:start position:0%
and is complying um with the federal
 
01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
title 10 language
 
01:01:04.789 --> 01:01:04.799 align:start position:0%
which is where this language comes from
 
01:01:07.750 --> 01:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
um so i just wanted to make clear in the
 
01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:08.470 align:start position:0%
um so i just wanted to make clear in the
record

01:01:08.470 --> 01:01:08.480 align:start position:0%
record
 
01:01:12.309 --> 01:01:12.319 align:start position:0%
um that if a hospital decided to
 
01:01:15.190 --> 01:01:15.200 align:start position:0%
operate a state-funded family planning
 
01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:16.069 align:start position:0%
operate a state-funded family planning
program

01:01:16.069 --> 01:01:16.079 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:01:19.349 --> 01:01:19.359 align:start position:0%
as it states in line 14 then it would
 
01:01:21.270 --> 01:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
need to comply with lines 14
 
01:01:24.789 --> 01:01:24.799 align:start position:0%
through 20 and that currently
 
01:01:27.589 --> 01:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
uh concord hospital is complying uh with
 
01:01:29.030 --> 01:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
this language which is
 
01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:32.240 align:start position:0%
uh federal language so mr tierney i
 
01:01:33.670 --> 01:01:33.680 align:start position:0%
think you just corrected
 
01:01:36.789 --> 01:01:36.799 align:start position:0%
a bad observation i made earlier it
 
01:01:40.870 --> 01:01:40.880 align:start position:0%
it because of line 14 down it could
 
01:01:43.510 --> 01:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
possibly affect programs that are
 
01:01:45.829 --> 01:01:45.839 align:start position:0%
hospital based and not just reproductive
 
01:01:45.839 --> 01:01:46.549 align:start position:0%
hospital based and not just reproductive
health

01:01:46.549 --> 01:01:46.559 align:start position:0%
health
 
01:01:49.589 --> 01:01:49.599 align:start position:0%
clinic based or is that true a
 
01:01:51.510 --> 01:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
state-funded family planning program
 
01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
that is run by a hospital would be
 
01:01:57.750 --> 01:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
affected by lines 14 through 20 if they
 
01:02:00.789 --> 01:02:00.799 align:start position:0%
applied for and ran a family planning
 
01:02:00.799 --> 01:02:02.309 align:start position:0%
applied for and ran a family planning
program

01:02:02.309 --> 01:02:02.319 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:02:05.510 --> 01:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
well i was wrong so thank you for
 
01:02:08.950 --> 01:02:08.960 align:start position:0%
clarifying that i appreciate it okay
 
01:02:11.270 --> 01:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
uh i don't let's go back to the
 
01:02:12.710 --> 01:02:12.720 align:start position:0%
attendees for a second
 
01:02:15.910 --> 01:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
and i can do that i have a clicker
 
01:02:19.109 --> 01:02:19.119 align:start position:0%
um i think
 
01:02:21.349 --> 01:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
the people with their hands up have all
 
01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
had an opportunity to speak
 
01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
and so um at this point uh i'm
 
01:02:30.390 --> 01:02:30.400 align:start position:0%
i think uh we can stop discussion on
 
01:02:32.470 --> 01:02:32.480 align:start position:0%
section 34
 
01:02:35.270 --> 01:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
and i believe uh we're scheduled for a
 
01:02:36.069 --> 01:02:36.079 align:start position:0%
vote on
 
01:02:39.750 --> 01:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
section 34 uh on monday
 
01:02:46.829 --> 01:02:46.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:46.839 --> 01:02:52.309 align:start position:0%
 
accurate

01:02:52.309 --> 01:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:54.950 --> 01:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
okay it's not it's not on my working
 
01:02:56.710 --> 01:02:56.720 align:start position:0%
schedule but i'll add it to my working
 
01:02:57.670 --> 01:02:57.680 align:start position:0%
schedule that
 
01:03:02.789 --> 01:03:02.799 align:start position:0%
that will take a vote on section 34 um
 
01:03:06.549 --> 01:03:06.559 align:start position:0%
on um on monday which i guess mr ripple
 
01:03:09.270 --> 01:03:09.280 align:start position:0%
you you want to remind me that you have
 
01:03:10.549 --> 01:03:10.559 align:start position:0%
to convert that into
 
01:03:14.150 --> 01:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
an ols drafted amendment so that oh it
 
01:03:15.829 --> 01:03:15.839 align:start position:0%
already is we haven't
 
01:03:18.870 --> 01:03:18.880 align:start position:0%
yet yeah okay all right well so i'm
 
01:03:22.150 --> 01:03:22.160 align:start position:0%
partially learning um all right
 
01:03:24.390 --> 01:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
uh with that i i think we're through
 
01:03:25.430 --> 01:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
01:03:28.710 --> 01:03:28.720 align:start position:0%
um section 34. thank you
 
01:03:31.670 --> 01:03:31.680 align:start position:0%

you
 
01:03:35.589 --> 01:03:35.599 align:start position:0%
uh everyone who's come in and testified
 
01:03:38.150 --> 01:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
um this is a this is a conversation that
 
01:03:39.829 --> 01:03:39.839 align:start position:0%
we'll be continuing to have
 
01:03:43.589 --> 01:03:43.599 align:start position:0%
so all right
 
01:03:47.910 --> 01:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
has um is the dynamic duo
 
01:03:51.270 --> 01:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
of mmis come in mr
 
01:03:56.230 --> 01:03:56.240 align:start position:0%
rutters and mr goulet are they available
 
01:04:01.430 --> 01:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:03.109 --> 01:04:03.119 align:start position:0%
looks like commissioner goulet is in the
 
01:04:08.069 --> 01:04:08.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:10.710 --> 01:04:10.720 align:start position:0%
five or six people we have five or six
 
01:04:12.549 --> 01:04:12.559 align:start position:0%
people from the previous conversation
 
01:04:14.710 --> 01:04:14.720 align:start position:0%
that need to
 
01:04:18.309 --> 01:04:18.319 align:start position:0%
be released okay and actually
 
01:04:19.589 --> 01:04:19.599 align:start position:0%
uh because there are a number of people
 
01:04:20.870 --> 01:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
in the attendees list if you could
 
01:04:22.470 --> 01:04:22.480 align:start position:0%
actually raise your hand if you expect
 
01:04:23.510 --> 01:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
to come in as a part of this
 
01:04:24.870 --> 01:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
conversation that would make things
 
01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:25.589 align:start position:0%
conversation that would make things
easier

01:04:25.589 --> 01:04:25.599 align:start position:0%
easier
 
01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:31.589 --> 01:04:31.599 align:start position:0%
you know who you should remove though
 
01:04:33.349 --> 01:04:33.359 align:start position:0%

i think you got everyone kevin um
 
01:05:16.789 --> 01:05:16.799 align:start position:0%
about okay attorney
 
01:05:19.029 --> 01:05:19.039 align:start position:0%
so so let's let's do the simple one
 
01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
first let's do
 
01:05:22.710 --> 01:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
the section that's related to the two
 
01:05:24.549 --> 01:05:24.559 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand
 
01:05:27.910 --> 01:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
dollars for um
 
01:05:31.910 --> 01:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
the adt hl7 transactions
 
01:05:48.069 --> 01:05:48.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:51.190 --> 01:05:51.200 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i was i was trying to uh do
 
01:05:52.309 --> 01:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
something else at the time could you
 
01:05:53.589 --> 01:05:53.599 align:start position:0%
repeat that please
 
01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
uh i'll i'll be more specific here in
 
01:06:00.710 --> 01:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:11.670 --> 01:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:14.150 --> 01:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
okay and then if you can share section
 
01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:16.829 align:start position:0%
okay and then if you can share section
38

01:06:16.829 --> 01:06:16.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:16.839 --> 01:06:20.150 align:start position:0%
 
outstanding

01:06:20.150 --> 01:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:23.190 --> 01:06:23.200 align:start position:0%
okay so um
 
01:06:25.270 --> 01:06:25.280 align:start position:0%
i'll i'll let whoever wants to speak to
 
01:06:27.670 --> 01:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
this go ahead and start the conversation
 
01:06:29.190 --> 01:06:29.200 align:start position:0%
but i just want to
 
01:06:31.349 --> 01:06:31.359 align:start position:0%
uh what we're looking for is
 
01:06:31.359 --> 01:06:32.230 align:start position:0%
uh what we're looking for is
clarification

01:06:32.230 --> 01:06:32.240 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
01:06:35.349 --> 01:06:35.359 align:start position:0%
here and i'm probably the
 
01:06:38.789 --> 01:06:38.799 align:start position:0%
person most confused about this because
 
01:06:43.190 --> 01:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
um as i look at this it it seems to me
 
01:06:45.990 --> 01:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
that we have information systems that
 
01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
we've set up
 
01:06:51.349 --> 01:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
to fire uh adt
 
01:06:54.470 --> 01:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
hl7 event notification
 
01:06:58.950 --> 01:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
out to specified other
 
01:07:01.270 --> 01:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
enter through other interfaces to other
 
01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:02.309 align:start position:0%
enter through other interfaces to other
systems

01:07:02.309 --> 01:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
systems
 
01:07:04.789 --> 01:07:04.799 align:start position:0%
so that they can use that adt event
 
01:07:04.799 --> 01:07:06.710 align:start position:0%
so that they can use that adt event
notification

01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
notification
 
01:07:09.750 --> 01:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
to plan coordinate
 
01:07:14.150 --> 01:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
and coordinate uh ongoing patient care
 
01:07:16.870 --> 01:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
and if if that is an accurate assumption
 
01:07:18.630 --> 01:07:18.640 align:start position:0%
of what we're doing here
 
01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
then i i don't understand what would
 
01:07:23.029 --> 01:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
cost two hundred thousand dollars if the
 
01:07:24.470 --> 01:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
initial setup
 
01:07:28.390 --> 01:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
of the adt hl7 message has already been
 
01:07:31.829 --> 01:07:31.839 align:start position:0%
invested in so so so that's the point
 
01:07:33.430 --> 01:07:33.440 align:start position:0%
where i'm confused
 
01:07:41.109 --> 01:07:41.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:44.470 --> 01:07:44.480 align:start position:0%
i think dave and henry um can provide
 
01:07:46.470 --> 01:07:46.480 align:start position:0%
more information
 
01:07:49.349 --> 01:07:49.359 align:start position:0%
well i can start representing edward's
 
01:07:51.109 --> 01:07:51.119 align:start position:0%
chair thank you chair this is david
 
01:07:53.750 --> 01:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
weeders information services director
 
01:07:57.029 --> 01:07:57.039 align:start position:0%
for health and human services
 
01:08:00.549 --> 01:08:00.559 align:start position:0%
that was an accurate description of what
 
01:08:03.029 --> 01:08:03.039 align:start position:0%
was implemented as part of the 1115
 
01:08:04.390 --> 01:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
district waiver
 
01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
with many of the providers across the
 
01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:08.829 align:start position:0%
with many of the providers across the
state

01:08:08.829 --> 01:08:08.839 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:08:11.750 --> 01:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
however it wasn't just the admission
 
01:08:14.549 --> 01:08:14.559 align:start position:0%
discharge transfer component it was also
 
01:08:16.309 --> 01:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
implementation of a shared care plan
 
01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
network and it's
 
01:08:20.390 --> 01:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
the ongoing cost to maintain that system
 
01:08:22.229 --> 01:08:22.239 align:start position:0%
as well as expand
 
01:08:25.349 --> 01:08:25.359 align:start position:0%
that that system into the seacoast
 
01:08:28.229 --> 01:08:28.239 align:start position:0%
area that is not currently on online and
 
01:08:30.630 --> 01:08:30.640 align:start position:0%
can continue to maintain
 
01:08:33.269 --> 01:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
the implementation that just completed
 
01:08:36.470 --> 01:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
recently at new hampshire hospital
 
01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
so that 200 000 that's listed there is
 
01:08:40.159 --> 01:08:41.110 align:start position:0%
so that 200 000 that's listed there is
actually

01:08:41.110 --> 01:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:08:44.149 --> 01:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
the general fund share of of the overall
 
01:08:46.550 --> 01:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
cost to support this system on an annual
 
01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:47.189 align:start position:0%
cost to support this system on an annual
basis

01:08:47.189 --> 01:08:47.199 align:start position:0%
basis
 
01:08:50.309 --> 01:08:50.319 align:start position:0%
going forward um the funding
 
01:08:54.070 --> 01:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
for this solution expired in december of
 
01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:55.430 align:start position:0%
for this solution expired in december of
2020

01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
2020
 
01:08:57.590 --> 01:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
the the providers actually were able to
 
01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:58.470 align:start position:0%
the the providers actually were able to
sustain

01:08:58.470 --> 01:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
sustain
 
01:09:01.990 --> 01:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
the solution through june 30th of 2021
 
01:09:05.430 --> 01:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
on their own funds and we're looking to
 
01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:05.990 align:start position:0%
on their own funds and we're looking to
continue

01:09:05.990 --> 01:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
continue
 
01:09:08.470 --> 01:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
that network of sharing to so that we
 
01:09:10.149 --> 01:09:10.159 align:start position:0%
were able to
 
01:09:12.070 --> 01:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
keep that keep the hospitals primary
 
01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
care clinics behavioral health community
 
01:09:15.510 --> 01:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
mental health centers
 
01:09:18.709 --> 01:09:18.719 align:start position:0%
the post-acute facilities and payers um
 
01:09:22.070 --> 01:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
in constant communication to realize
 
01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:22.789 align:start position:0%
in constant communication to realize
that

01:09:22.789 --> 01:09:22.799 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:09:24.550 --> 01:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
the benefits that we've had that we've
 
01:09:26.789 --> 01:09:26.799 align:start position:0%
seen over the last couple years
 
01:09:29.590 --> 01:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
so we've we've seen benefits of this
 
01:09:31.110 --> 01:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
shared care planning and
 
01:09:34.390 --> 01:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
emission discharge transfer program
 
01:09:36.950 --> 01:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
reducing the number of emergency
 
01:09:39.030 --> 01:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
department visits per month
 
01:09:41.669 --> 01:09:41.679 align:start position:0%
as well as the average time patients
 
01:09:42.950 --> 01:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
spend in the ed
 
01:09:45.030 --> 01:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
has declined by over just under 10
 
01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:46.390 align:start position:0%
has declined by over just under 10
percent

01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:09:49.590 --> 01:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
which essentially relates to how many
 
01:09:51.669 --> 01:09:51.679 align:start position:0%
medicaid claims come in
 
01:09:54.870 --> 01:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
as a result of those visits in the ed i
 
01:09:56.870 --> 01:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
i i know that you guys have to leave
 
01:09:58.870 --> 01:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
here shortly so i'm sorry to cut you off
 
01:09:58.880 --> 01:09:59.830 align:start position:0%
here shortly so i'm sorry to cut you off
but

01:09:59.830 --> 01:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
i i think there's probably universal
 
01:10:06.070 --> 01:10:06.080 align:start position:0%
uh agreement that that's a good policy
 
01:10:07.590 --> 01:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
and that the shared
 
01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
uh care plans are is is just good health
 
01:10:12.470 --> 01:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
care policy
 
01:10:14.870 --> 01:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
so i'm really just looking at the the
 
01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
the money
 
01:10:19.270 --> 01:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
and the way we're delivering the money
 
01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
it sounds to me
 
01:10:23.669 --> 01:10:23.679 align:start position:0%
like a few things are true but that that
 
01:10:25.750 --> 01:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know who drafted this but it
 
01:10:27.270 --> 01:10:27.280 align:start position:0%
sounds like
 
01:10:30.310 --> 01:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
as drafted it doesn't really do
 
01:10:34.870 --> 01:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
what you just described the need to be
 
01:10:38.149 --> 01:10:38.159 align:start position:0%
it's it and and so i'm just wondering
 
01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
if if we keep this as an hb2 item
 
01:10:45.270 --> 01:10:45.280 align:start position:0%
if it's really as precise as it should
 
01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:45.910 align:start position:0%
if it's really as precise as it should
be

01:10:45.910 --> 01:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:10:48.790 --> 01:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
so that it it funds the program that i
 
01:10:56.550 --> 01:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:59.669 --> 01:10:59.679 align:start position:0%
i i think it does because it does say to
 
01:11:02.310 --> 01:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
support expanded and continued
 
01:11:03.990 --> 01:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
so i i think the language is broad
 
01:11:05.590 --> 01:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
enough that it would support what they
 
01:11:09.189 --> 01:11:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:11.510 --> 01:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
okay so but this is money that's
 
01:11:12.790 --> 01:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
intended to be sent
 
01:11:15.510 --> 01:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
to health care providers to help them
 
01:11:17.110 --> 01:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
pay for their
 
01:11:20.950 --> 01:11:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:23.990 --> 01:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
isn't it or did i mishear you
 
01:11:27.030 --> 01:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
i apologize chair um actually it's for
 
01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
us to
 
01:11:29.350 --> 01:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
contract with collective medical
 
01:11:32.470 --> 01:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
technologies to maintain that system
 
01:11:35.110 --> 01:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
for the providers that leverage it today
 
01:11:35.910 --> 01:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
so we would
 
01:11:38.790 --> 01:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
we would continue to support that system
 
01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:39.669 align:start position:0%
we would continue to support that system
um

01:11:39.669 --> 01:11:39.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:43.030 --> 01:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
ongoing from for the next biennium
 
01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
and from there so we would not be
 
01:11:46.630 --> 01:11:46.640 align:start position:0%
providing the funds
 
01:11:49.270 --> 01:11:49.280 align:start position:0%
to the providers we would be contracting
 
01:11:50.950 --> 01:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
with collective medical technologies
 
01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:51.350 align:start position:0%
with collective medical technologies
which

01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:11:53.669 --> 01:11:53.679 align:start position:0%
is currently in place for this solution
 
01:11:55.830 --> 01:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
to con to expand and continue that
 
01:11:58.310 --> 01:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
emission discharge transfer
 
01:11:59.750 --> 01:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
which also includes new hampshire
 
01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:01.510 align:start position:0%
which also includes new hampshire
hospital

01:12:01.510 --> 01:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
01:12:05.430 --> 01:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
okay so so why at what point
 
01:12:07.910 --> 01:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
would we not see this as an hb2 any
 
01:12:09.430 --> 01:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
longer that it would just be
 
01:12:12.390 --> 01:12:12.400 align:start position:0%
incorporated into the ongoing operation
 
01:12:15.830 --> 01:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
operating budget of the state why is
 
01:12:17.910 --> 01:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
this still an hb2 instead of just
 
01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:18.630 align:start position:0%
this still an hb2 instead of just
absorbed

01:12:18.630 --> 01:12:18.640 align:start position:0%
absorbed
 
01:12:22.390 --> 01:12:22.400 align:start position:0%
into a line within hb1
 
01:12:25.590 --> 01:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
so i think the i think i had described
 
01:12:26.390 --> 01:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
earlier that
 
01:12:29.189 --> 01:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
this item was realized that we left it
 
01:12:30.709 --> 01:12:30.719 align:start position:0%
out of the budget too late in the
 
01:12:30.719 --> 01:12:31.750 align:start position:0%
out of the budget too late in the
process

01:12:31.750 --> 01:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
and so hb1 had already been finalized
 
01:12:36.070 --> 01:12:36.080 align:start position:0%
and so the governor's office put it in
 
01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:37.590 align:start position:0%
and so the governor's office put it in
hb2

01:12:37.590 --> 01:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
hb2
 
01:12:39.669 --> 01:12:39.679 align:start position:0%
so there's no reason that cat cannot be
 
01:12:43.510 --> 01:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:46.630 --> 01:12:46.640 align:start position:0%
so if we if we just put 200 000
 
01:12:49.669 --> 01:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
in hb1 we could we don't need 38.
 
01:12:51.910 --> 01:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
because you already have authority under
 
01:12:55.270 --> 01:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
your ongoing operations to do this
 
01:12:57.270 --> 01:12:57.280 align:start position:0%
correct and what to dave's point
 
01:12:58.390 --> 01:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
something that i had
 
01:13:01.189 --> 01:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
forgot about which is embarrassing but
 
01:13:01.199 --> 01:13:01.750 align:start position:0%
forgot about which is embarrassing but
uh

01:13:01.750 --> 01:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:13:03.270 --> 01:13:03.280 align:start position:0%
we would also need to add the federal
 
01:13:05.030 --> 01:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
funds that would match to that two
 
01:13:08.070 --> 01:13:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:09.910 --> 01:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
all right so we have another revenue
 
01:13:11.350 --> 01:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
stream to consider
 
01:13:15.430 --> 01:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
yes if you would like i can
 
01:13:17.510 --> 01:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
do a change request and provide it to
 
01:13:19.030 --> 01:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
kevin for what that would look like and
 
01:13:24.550 --> 01:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:26.950 --> 01:13:26.960 align:start position:0%
i i don't i don't i'm tempted to say yes
 
01:13:28.390 --> 01:13:28.400 align:start position:0%
but i want to hear
 
01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:30.400 align:start position:0%
uh from the other committee members if
 
01:13:32.550 --> 01:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
there's any question or conversation
 
01:13:37.830 --> 01:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:40.870 --> 01:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
i'm not i'm not seeing any hands up
 
01:13:44.709 --> 01:13:44.719 align:start position:0%
um i i think i'd like to do something
 
01:13:45.270 --> 01:13:45.280 align:start position:0%
with this
 
01:13:48.550 --> 01:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
i whether we we we move it back into
 
01:13:51.189 --> 01:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
hb1 as part of the ongoing operations
 
01:13:52.470 --> 01:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
and you add back the
 
01:13:55.590 --> 01:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
federal revenue number or i i just
 
01:13:58.790 --> 01:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
i don't i i'm not a big fan of hp2 to
 
01:13:59.590 --> 01:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
begin with
 
01:14:02.149 --> 01:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
i know it's necessary but i'd rather
 
01:14:03.350 --> 01:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
minimize its use
 
01:14:05.669 --> 01:14:05.679 align:start position:0%
if we don't need it so if you
 
01:14:07.430 --> 01:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
representative irf
 
01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
please please tackle me if i'm going in
 
01:14:11.830 --> 01:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
the wrong direction go ahead
 
01:14:14.229 --> 01:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
no i just want to say that i agree if
 
01:14:15.350 --> 01:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
karen's able to
 
01:14:17.830 --> 01:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
provide the information for us to
 
01:14:19.990 --> 01:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
incorporate it into hb1
 
01:14:21.830 --> 01:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
both the general and federal funds that
 
01:14:23.430 --> 01:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
seem to be the best
 
01:14:30.149 --> 01:14:30.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:32.070 --> 01:14:32.080 align:start position:0%
ripple would you get ready to show the
 
01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
section of the governor's budget related
 
01:14:35.430 --> 01:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
to mmis
 
01:14:39.430 --> 01:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
please sure
 
01:14:42.950 --> 01:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
so okay so ms rounds i guess i am asking
 
01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:43.350 align:start position:0%
so okay so ms rounds i guess i am asking
you

01:14:43.350 --> 01:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:14:47.510 --> 01:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
to to work with kevin um and whether
 
01:14:49.990 --> 01:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
we we fix it because we're running out
 
01:14:50.790 --> 01:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
of time
 
01:14:53.910 --> 01:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
or uh the senate has an opportunity
 
01:14:56.950 --> 01:14:56.960 align:start position:0%
to to to fix is the wrong word that
 
01:14:58.310 --> 01:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
assumes it's broken
 
01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
but to modify it um
 
01:15:03.669 --> 01:15:03.679 align:start position:0%
you know just give give us some feedback
 
01:15:05.590 --> 01:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
i i don't think it's the most important
 
01:15:07.270 --> 01:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
thing we're working on right now
 
01:15:09.830 --> 01:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
but it's i think it's in the worth doing
 
01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:12.310 align:start position:0%
but it's i think it's in the worth doing
category

01:15:12.310 --> 01:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
category
 
01:15:16.149 --> 01:15:16.159 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
01:15:19.590 --> 01:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
i think we're ready to talk about
 
01:15:22.870 --> 01:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
the mmis portion of the budget again
 
01:15:25.990 --> 01:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
and um just to just to frame this
 
01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
uh mr goulet welcome sir i know you're
 
01:15:29.910 --> 01:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
very busy as
 
01:15:33.669 --> 01:15:33.679 align:start position:0%
as everyone is but um as we
 
01:15:37.270 --> 01:15:37.280 align:start position:0%
went through um a funding exercise
 
01:15:39.350 --> 01:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
the other day as a committee going from
 
01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
the fy 21
 
01:15:43.350 --> 01:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
base up to the amount of money that we
 
01:15:45.270 --> 01:15:45.280 align:start position:0%
thought we may have available from a
 
01:15:48.229 --> 01:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
ways a previous ways and means estimate
 
01:15:50.830 --> 01:15:50.840 align:start position:0%
we started to run out of money as we
 
01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:51.990 align:start position:0%
we started to run out of money as we
discussed

01:15:51.990 --> 01:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
discussed
 
01:15:56.870 --> 01:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
the mmis portion of our priorities
 
01:15:59.830 --> 01:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
and and um and it's just a lot of
 
01:16:00.870 --> 01:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
operating money
 
01:16:03.990 --> 01:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
in fy 22 and 23
 
01:16:06.790 --> 01:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
and we had some testimony from senator
 
01:16:09.510 --> 01:16:09.520 align:start position:0%
clegg who gave us a 10-year history
 
01:16:12.550 --> 01:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
um he he cited
 
01:16:15.510 --> 01:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
some real systemic problems that that
 
01:16:17.510 --> 01:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
the department has had
 
01:16:20.790 --> 01:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
prior to your arrival prior to mr
 
01:16:23.189 --> 01:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
wetter's arrival prior to the
 
01:16:25.830 --> 01:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner's arrival
 
01:16:30.070 --> 01:16:30.080 align:start position:0%
but but historically the department
 
01:16:33.189 --> 01:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
has had problems
 
01:16:36.470 --> 01:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
effectively and efficiently implementing
 
01:16:39.910 --> 01:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
large its uh systems
 
01:16:43.030 --> 01:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
and so so as we look at this it's a lot
 
01:16:43.669 --> 01:16:43.679 align:start position:0%
of money
 
01:16:46.470 --> 01:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
and and and we'd like to we'd like to
 
01:16:48.709 --> 01:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
have confidence if it gets spent
 
01:16:51.270 --> 01:16:51.280 align:start position:0%
that you have the right people and a
 
01:16:52.229 --> 01:16:52.239 align:start position:0%
good plan
 
01:16:55.510 --> 01:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
and and so i'll i'll stop there and just
 
01:16:59.110 --> 01:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
let you all address that how you wish
 
01:17:02.709 --> 01:17:02.719 align:start position:0%
well i'll start uh mr chair um
 
01:17:04.950 --> 01:17:04.960 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee um for the
 
01:17:05.910 --> 01:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
record my name's
 
01:17:07.510 --> 01:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
dennis boule i'm the commissioner of the
 
01:17:09.510 --> 01:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
department of information technology
 
01:17:13.270 --> 01:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
um you know i haven't been party to the
 
01:17:15.590 --> 01:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
previous testimony on mmis
 
01:17:18.310 --> 01:17:18.320 align:start position:0%
but certainly we've had our challenges
 
01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:18.709 align:start position:0%
but certainly we've had our challenges
as

01:17:18.709 --> 01:17:18.719 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:17:22.470 --> 01:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
as a state as all states do with mmis
 
01:17:25.270 --> 01:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
because it's you know typically the
 
01:17:27.830 --> 01:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
largest and most complex system
 
01:17:29.830 --> 01:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
it has a lot of political sides to it
 
01:17:31.830 --> 01:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
because of because of how
 
01:17:35.189 --> 01:17:35.199 align:start position:0%
you know the the citizen impact uh
 
01:17:37.830 --> 01:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
in in the total dollars that are that
 
01:17:38.790 --> 01:17:38.800 align:start position:0%
are expended
 
01:17:41.590 --> 01:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
through mmis and the fact that policies
 
01:17:42.310 --> 01:17:42.320 align:start position:0%
tend to change
 
01:17:45.510 --> 01:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
fairly rapidly particularly as as
 
01:17:49.910 --> 01:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
party control ebbs and flows
 
01:17:53.990 --> 01:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
that said the
 
01:17:57.030 --> 01:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
dhejs team and my team
 
01:18:00.070 --> 01:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
at this point i'm coming up on six years
 
01:18:01.590 --> 01:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
as commissioner
 
01:18:04.630 --> 01:18:04.640 align:start position:0%
we're at the best place we've been so
 
01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
far since i've been here as it relates
 
01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:07.990 align:start position:0%
far since i've been here as it relates
to

01:18:07.990 --> 01:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:18:10.470 --> 01:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
effective management of our systems
 
01:18:11.350 --> 01:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
overall but
 
01:18:14.790 --> 01:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
really in particular mmis we have a
 
01:18:18.229 --> 01:18:18.239 align:start position:0%
strong team on the business side hhs
 
01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
with david weeders and henry lookman's
 
01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:21.830 align:start position:0%
with david weeders and henry lookman's
team

01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
team
 
01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
our doit team that's embedded in mmis is
 
01:18:29.189 --> 01:18:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:31.590 --> 01:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
the david and karen have put together a
 
01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:32.630 align:start position:0%
the david and karen have put together a
budget

01:18:32.630 --> 01:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:18:36.790 --> 01:18:36.800 align:start position:0%
that fairly represents what is
 
01:18:39.430 --> 01:18:39.440 align:start position:0%
required to run this extremely important
 
01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:41.830 align:start position:0%
required to run this extremely important
program

01:18:41.830 --> 01:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:18:45.510 --> 01:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
we i'm thinking that
 
01:18:47.270 --> 01:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
and hoping that if you've had a chance
 
01:18:50.070 --> 01:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
to look at the life cycle considerations
 
01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:50.550 align:start position:0%
to look at the life cycle considerations
that

01:18:50.550 --> 01:18:50.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:18:53.189 --> 01:18:53.199 align:start position:0%
that david and myself have worked on
 
01:18:54.870 --> 01:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
with respect to that
 
01:18:56.790 --> 01:18:56.800 align:start position:0%
large and complex systems that we work
 
01:18:59.590 --> 01:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
with the governor's office on as well
 
01:19:01.830 --> 01:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
you'll see that we have a good long-term
 
01:19:03.750 --> 01:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
plan that not only
 
01:19:06.790 --> 01:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
will keep keep our medicaid program
 
01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
running well
 
01:19:10.709 --> 01:19:10.719 align:start position:0%
but we'll also do it at a more
 
01:19:14.070 --> 01:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
predictable cost over time
 
01:19:16.870 --> 01:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
i will that ends my formal comments i'm
 
01:19:17.990 --> 01:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
happy to answer
 
01:19:20.709 --> 01:19:20.719 align:start position:0%
i i appreciate that and and i've i you
 
01:19:21.669 --> 01:19:21.679 align:start position:0%
know just to
 
01:19:24.390 --> 01:19:24.400 align:start position:0%
let people know uh you've been willing
 
01:19:25.910 --> 01:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
to talk to me for the
 
01:19:28.390 --> 01:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
the past four years and and help me
 
01:19:29.990 --> 01:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
understand what's going on with your
 
01:19:32.390 --> 01:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
strategic planning process and
 
01:19:35.550 --> 01:19:35.560 align:start position:0%
and i've seen the improvement and the
 
01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:36.870 align:start position:0%
and i've seen the improvement and the
professionalism

01:19:36.870 --> 01:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
professionalism
 
01:19:40.870 --> 01:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
of how the of your your organization
 
01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
and the department's i.t group is has
 
01:19:44.390 --> 01:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
been improving
 
01:19:46.709 --> 01:19:46.719 align:start position:0%
over you know over the last four years
 
01:19:46.719 --> 01:19:47.750 align:start position:0%
over you know over the last four years
so

01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:19:51.110 --> 01:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
so i i i have confidence in you i i
 
01:19:53.750 --> 01:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna let you uh ask a question here
 
01:19:54.470 --> 01:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
in a second
 
01:19:56.310 --> 01:19:56.320 align:start position:0%
uh representative erf if you still have
 
01:19:57.590 --> 01:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
one but but
 
01:20:01.430 --> 01:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
so so uh so so i'm gonna respond
 
01:20:04.790 --> 01:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
just from a large i.t project planning
 
01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:06.390 align:start position:0%
just from a large i.t project planning
perspective

01:20:06.390 --> 01:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
01:20:10.470 --> 01:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
as i look at the authorizations and
 
01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:11.430 align:start position:0%
as i look at the authorizations and
vacancies

01:20:11.430 --> 01:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
vacancies
 
01:20:15.189 --> 01:20:15.199 align:start position:0%
in the it staff of the department
 
01:20:18.709 --> 01:20:18.719 align:start position:0%
i see 12 people on hand and 10 vacancies
 
01:20:21.270 --> 01:20:21.280 align:start position:0%
out of the 22 authorizations
 
01:20:24.470 --> 01:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
for um as
 
01:20:28.390 --> 01:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
of march 11th and so
 
01:20:31.030 --> 01:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
and i see an immediate opportunity to
 
01:20:34.149 --> 01:20:34.159 align:start position:0%
begin spending 12.5 million dollars on
 
01:20:35.669 --> 01:20:35.679 align:start position:0%
july 1.
 
01:20:39.669 --> 01:20:39.679 align:start position:0%
and so i am just concerned about the
 
01:20:41.590 --> 01:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
practical ability
 
01:20:44.790 --> 01:20:44.800 align:start position:0%
to to hire the right people
 
01:20:47.669 --> 01:20:47.679 align:start position:0%
with the right skills and experience get
 
01:20:49.030 --> 01:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
them on boarded
 
01:20:52.470 --> 01:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
properly and oriented particularly in a
 
01:20:54.310 --> 01:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
pandemic world where nobody
 
01:20:57.590 --> 01:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
can talk to each other face to face
 
01:21:01.189 --> 01:21:01.199 align:start position:0%
then immediately pivot to implementing
 
01:21:04.470 --> 01:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
an expensive large-scale project on
 
01:21:07.910 --> 01:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
starting july 1. and so i'm just curious
 
01:21:11.590 --> 01:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
what what you all have and again anyone
 
01:21:13.030 --> 01:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
can respond to this but
 
01:21:15.910 --> 01:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
but i'm just curious if you have a
 
01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:16.470 align:start position:0%
but i'm just curious if you have a
project

01:21:16.470 --> 01:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
project
 
01:21:19.510 --> 01:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
plan that you've reviewed and that you
 
01:21:21.750 --> 01:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
have the human capabilities
 
01:21:25.030 --> 01:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
necessary to to pull this off on a
 
01:21:27.110 --> 01:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
timeline where you need that much money
 
01:21:31.189 --> 01:21:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:34.229 --> 01:21:34.239 align:start position:0%
well thank you thank you uh mr chair um
 
01:21:34.950 --> 01:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
i'm going to
 
01:21:37.669 --> 01:21:37.679 align:start position:0%
give a a broad response and then i would
 
01:21:39.590 --> 01:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
ask that david readers to comment as
 
01:21:40.310 --> 01:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
well but
 
01:21:43.750 --> 01:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
um you know the we're
 
01:21:45.350 --> 01:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
we're looking at a couple things here
 
01:21:47.510 --> 01:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
right we're looking at a continuing an
 
01:21:48.790 --> 01:21:48.800 align:start position:0%
ongoing broad
 
01:21:51.990 --> 01:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
program right and funding that as
 
01:21:54.229 --> 01:21:54.239 align:start position:0%
it's contact as we're contractually
 
01:21:56.070 --> 01:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
committed to
 
01:21:59.510 --> 01:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
and then we're looking at the life cycle
 
01:22:01.510 --> 01:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
considerations of the existing
 
01:22:04.229 --> 01:22:04.239 align:start position:0%
contract and then we're also looking at
 
01:22:05.430 --> 01:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
at the
 
01:22:08.629 --> 01:22:08.639 align:start position:0%
reprocurement over time in terms of
 
01:22:10.229 --> 01:22:10.239 align:start position:0%
recruiting i.t talent
 
01:22:14.070 --> 01:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
um we we haven't had um
 
01:22:16.149 --> 01:22:16.159 align:start position:0%
as much trouble as i have heard some of
 
01:22:17.590 --> 01:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
my peers in other states
 
01:22:19.270 --> 01:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
um recruiting in new hampshire i think
 
01:22:21.110 --> 01:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
it's a couple things we're pretty close
 
01:22:23.669 --> 01:22:23.679 align:start position:0%
to the boston job market and we have a
 
01:22:23.679 --> 01:22:24.310 align:start position:0%
to the boston job market and we have a
um

01:22:24.310 --> 01:22:24.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:27.590 --> 01:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
you know we have a better um quality of
 
01:22:29.510 --> 01:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
life and if you're not commuting down 93
 
01:22:30.950 --> 01:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
or group three
 
01:22:32.950 --> 01:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
that means a lot um the other thing
 
01:22:35.030 --> 01:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
that's happened too is i i've observed
 
01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:35.430 align:start position:0%
that's happened too is i i've observed
that

01:22:35.430 --> 01:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:22:38.950 --> 01:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
um the fact that the culture and
 
01:22:40.709 --> 01:22:40.719 align:start position:0%
performance of doit and our
 
01:22:43.110 --> 01:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
relationships with the agencies
 
01:22:44.790 --> 01:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
our improved relationships with the
 
01:22:46.470 --> 01:22:46.480 align:start position:0%
agencies which you have observed and
 
01:22:47.750 --> 01:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
commented on
 
01:22:51.270 --> 01:22:51.280 align:start position:0%
um has hasn't gone unnoticed
 
01:22:54.070 --> 01:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
for example if we bring a contractor in
 
01:22:54.080 --> 01:22:54.390 align:start position:0%
for example if we bring a contractor in
for

01:22:54.390 --> 01:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:22:57.590 --> 01:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
a um making fairly high salary through
 
01:22:59.430 --> 01:22:59.440 align:start position:0%
through contracting it's not unusual to
 
01:23:03.270 --> 01:23:03.280 align:start position:0%
have them want to come to work for us
 
01:23:04.870 --> 01:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
at the end of their contract in fact i
 
01:23:06.229 --> 01:23:06.239 align:start position:0%
have a couple right now i'd love to hire
 
01:23:08.229 --> 01:23:08.239 align:start position:0%
if i had the open position
 
01:23:10.390 --> 01:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
the open positions that you referred to
 
01:23:12.470 --> 01:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not certain what they are i might
 
01:23:14.149 --> 01:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
want to qualify that but
 
01:23:17.590 --> 01:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
i know that we did doit did unfund
 
01:23:19.030 --> 01:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
a number of positions to make our
 
01:23:20.790 --> 01:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
general fund targets
 
01:23:23.590 --> 01:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
if the governor stays and and division
 
01:23:25.669 --> 01:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
one has been considering
 
01:23:27.350 --> 01:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
refunding some of those positions i
 
01:23:28.870 --> 01:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
think that's what you're referring to
 
01:23:30.470 --> 01:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
but i'm not certain
 
01:23:33.510 --> 01:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
uh could could you qualify please that's
 
01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:33.990 align:start position:0%
uh could could you qualify please that's
a that's

01:23:33.990 --> 01:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
a that's
 
01:23:36.790 --> 01:23:36.800 align:start position:0%
a fair question i i i don't i'm not
 
01:23:38.470 --> 01:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
paying attention to division three at
 
01:23:39.350 --> 01:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
this point i'm just
 
01:23:42.390 --> 01:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
talking about division three the the
 
01:23:46.149 --> 01:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
dhhs uh line for it
 
01:23:49.189 --> 01:23:49.199 align:start position:0%
uh i has uh 22
 
01:23:52.470 --> 01:23:52.480 align:start position:0%
authorized 12 hired 10
 
01:23:57.510 --> 01:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
vacant i think as of the 11th of march
 
01:24:00.830 --> 01:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
yeah i'll let the dhhs folks comment on
 
01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:02.870 align:start position:0%
yeah i'll let the dhhs folks comment on
that

01:24:02.870 --> 01:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:24:06.229 --> 01:24:06.239 align:start position:0%
so um again chair those positions i
 
01:24:06.239 --> 01:24:06.790 align:start position:0%
so um again chair those positions i
believe

01:24:06.790 --> 01:24:06.800 align:start position:0%
believe
 
01:24:08.790 --> 01:24:08.800 align:start position:0%
are that you might be referring to are
 
01:24:10.390 --> 01:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
the information services
 
01:24:12.790 --> 01:24:12.800 align:start position:0%
positions in my group that are
 
01:24:14.470 --> 01:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
supporting the pmo
 
01:24:17.590 --> 01:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
as well as our security life cycle
 
01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:18.390 align:start position:0%
as well as our security life cycle
management

01:24:18.390 --> 01:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
management
 
01:24:21.430 --> 01:24:21.440 align:start position:0%
and um and data warehousing for
 
01:24:24.550 --> 01:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
the mmis specifically we have
 
01:24:26.470 --> 01:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
several positions i believe it's six
 
01:24:28.470 --> 01:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
that were vacant and
 
01:24:31.189 --> 01:24:31.199 align:start position:0%
were unfunded um four of which were
 
01:24:33.030 --> 01:24:33.040 align:start position:0%
unfunded in this biennium the current
 
01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:34.070 align:start position:0%
unfunded in this biennium the current
biennium

01:24:34.070 --> 01:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
01:24:37.110 --> 01:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
that we were asking to fund
 
01:24:40.709 --> 01:24:40.719 align:start position:0%
um fund a total of four positions in the
 
01:24:41.750 --> 01:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
next biennium
 
01:24:44.870 --> 01:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
and then associated with the alvarez and
 
01:24:47.350 --> 01:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
marcel report we're also hiring it two
 
01:24:50.709 --> 01:24:50.719 align:start position:0%
additional project managers to assist
 
01:24:50.719 --> 01:24:51.189 align:start position:0%
additional project managers to assist
with

01:24:51.189 --> 01:24:51.199 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:24:53.910 --> 01:24:53.920 align:start position:0%
the reprocurement efforts so what we'll
 
01:24:54.470 --> 01:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
have is
 
01:24:56.550 --> 01:24:56.560 align:start position:0%
uh well we'll be we currently have
 
01:24:59.590 --> 01:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
posted an mmis director position
 
01:25:01.030 --> 01:25:01.040 align:start position:0%
full-time position as well as a
 
01:25:02.870 --> 01:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
part-time position to
 
01:25:05.990 --> 01:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
facilitate the leadership alongside doit
 
01:25:09.270 --> 01:25:09.280 align:start position:0%
myself and henry littman's team for that
 
01:25:11.990 --> 01:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
strategic planning and direction
 
01:25:14.310 --> 01:25:14.320 align:start position:0%
leveraging the doit embedded team for
 
01:25:15.510 --> 01:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
that ongoing
 
01:25:17.510 --> 01:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
life cycle management which they've been
 
01:25:19.110 --> 01:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
doing a great job of the
 
01:25:21.030 --> 01:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
initial step of the tech stack upgrade
 
01:25:22.709 --> 01:25:22.719 align:start position:0%
and we would anticipate
 
01:25:24.870 --> 01:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
uh nothing less with a second phase of
 
01:25:26.629 --> 01:25:26.639 align:start position:0%
that tech stack the technical stack
 
01:25:26.639 --> 01:25:28.149 align:start position:0%
that tech stack the technical stack
upgrade

01:25:28.149 --> 01:25:28.159 align:start position:0%
upgrade
 
01:25:30.870 --> 01:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
and then those those two additional
 
01:25:32.070 --> 01:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
project managers that i
 
01:25:34.070 --> 01:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
alluded to from the alvarez marcel
 
01:25:35.750 --> 01:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
report recommendation
 
01:25:38.390 --> 01:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
would be really focused on building
 
01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:38.870 align:start position:0%
would be really focused on building
those

01:25:38.870 --> 01:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:25:42.470 --> 01:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
rfps working with across the teams to
 
01:25:44.229 --> 01:25:44.239 align:start position:0%
do successful procurements and
 
01:25:46.709 --> 01:25:46.719 align:start position:0%
implementations over the next biennium
 
01:25:49.590 --> 01:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
so when it comes to that project plan
 
01:25:50.790 --> 01:25:50.800 align:start position:0%
and resources
 
01:25:54.950 --> 01:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
we we do recognize that we are at a
 
01:25:57.110 --> 01:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
deficiency in terms of staffing to be
 
01:25:59.510 --> 01:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
able to to do this but it's also in our
 
01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:00.470 align:start position:0%
able to to do this but it's also in our
operating

01:26:00.470 --> 01:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
operating
 
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
budget to hire those those staff members
 
01:26:07.270 --> 01:26:07.280 align:start position:0%
and have them on boarded again
 
01:26:10.870 --> 01:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
recognizing um chair that the
 
01:26:14.310 --> 01:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
complexity of onboarding people into it
 
01:26:15.350 --> 01:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
and is
 
01:26:17.669 --> 01:26:17.679 align:start position:0%
positions and specifically with medicaid
 
01:26:17.679 --> 01:26:18.470 align:start position:0%
positions and specifically with medicaid
experience

01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
experience
 
01:26:20.950 --> 01:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
we've we've actually found that it's
 
01:26:21.990 --> 01:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
been successful
 
01:26:26.229 --> 01:26:26.239 align:start position:0%
in bringing people with more generalized
 
01:26:28.229 --> 01:26:28.239 align:start position:0%
backgrounds and training them bringing
 
01:26:30.709 --> 01:26:30.719 align:start position:0%
them on board with our medicaid program
 
01:26:32.950 --> 01:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
that that has been that has been a
 
01:26:34.070 --> 01:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
successful method
 
01:26:36.950 --> 01:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
of of learning it takes about four to
 
01:26:38.149 --> 01:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
six months to do that
 
01:26:40.390 --> 01:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
but we think it's actually right in line
 
01:26:42.149 --> 01:26:42.159 align:start position:0%
with our plans for
 
01:26:43.990 --> 01:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
for that reprocurement and the tech
 
01:26:47.750 --> 01:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:51.590 --> 01:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
okay so um
 
01:26:54.709 --> 01:26:54.719 align:start position:0%
so i i think you are seeing
 
01:26:57.750 --> 01:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
that you have about us i don't want to
 
01:26:59.110 --> 01:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
put words in your mouth but what i'm
 
01:27:01.189 --> 01:27:01.199 align:start position:0%
hearing is you you've got a six-month
 
01:27:04.390 --> 01:27:04.400 align:start position:0%
lag to really hire the full team that
 
01:27:05.189 --> 01:27:05.199 align:start position:0%
you need
 
01:27:08.629 --> 01:27:08.639 align:start position:0%
to take on this project and so we're
 
01:27:09.430 --> 01:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
01:27:12.629 --> 01:27:12.639 align:start position:0%
maybe october-ish um
 
01:27:14.709 --> 01:27:14.719 align:start position:0%
and and so i'll just come back to the
 
01:27:16.390 --> 01:27:16.400 align:start position:0%
question of
 
01:27:19.990 --> 01:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
is 12.5 million in general funds
 
01:27:23.669 --> 01:27:23.679 align:start position:0%
in the current year starting july 1
 
01:27:25.910 --> 01:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
really the right amount of money given
 
01:27:29.430 --> 01:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
that it's hard to imagine
 
01:27:32.310 --> 01:27:32.320 align:start position:0%
your team being really ready to
 
01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:33.270 align:start position:0%
your team being really ready to
confidently

01:27:33.270 --> 01:27:33.280 align:start position:0%
confidently
 
01:27:37.510 --> 01:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
and effectively run this project
 
01:27:39.350 --> 01:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to make sure we don't
 
01:27:42.229 --> 01:27:42.239 align:start position:0%
create a situation
 
01:27:45.430 --> 01:27:45.440 align:start position:0%
where there's potential waste understood
 
01:27:47.669 --> 01:27:47.679 align:start position:0%
um chair so when you're referring to the
 
01:27:49.590 --> 01:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
12.5 million
 
01:27:53.030 --> 01:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
um in in this on the screen shared
 
01:27:56.390 --> 01:27:56.400 align:start position:0%
here can you ex can you qualify what
 
01:27:58.709 --> 01:27:58.719 align:start position:0%
that 12.5 you're referring to so i can
 
01:28:00.950 --> 01:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
address it properly yes yes sir that's a
 
01:28:01.910 --> 01:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
that's a
 
01:28:03.590 --> 01:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
fair question do you see the shared
 
01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:05.189 align:start position:0%
fair question do you see the shared
screen

01:28:05.189 --> 01:28:05.199 align:start position:0%
screen
 
01:28:07.590 --> 01:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
oh i see the general fund 12.5 million
 
01:28:09.189 --> 01:28:09.199 align:start position:0%
is that what you're referring to
 
01:28:14.870 --> 01:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
that's exactly it's 12.486552 thank you
 
01:28:17.830 --> 01:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
so this operating budget specifically as
 
01:28:18.629 --> 01:28:18.639 align:start position:0%
it breaks down
 
01:28:20.950 --> 01:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
is associated with two two contracts
 
01:28:23.030 --> 01:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
one's with conduit and one's with ntt
 
01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:24.229 align:start position:0%
one's with conduit and one's with ntt
data

01:28:24.229 --> 01:28:24.239 align:start position:0%
data
 
01:28:28.070 --> 01:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
and so the general funds costs of that
 
01:28:32.149 --> 01:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
line 102 for that 45 million
 
01:28:34.709 --> 01:28:34.719 align:start position:0%
that the majority of which i think out
 
01:28:36.470 --> 01:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
all of which is listed here
 
01:28:38.310 --> 01:28:38.320 align:start position:0%
is associated with contracts with
 
01:28:40.790 --> 01:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
conduit and ntt data so the conduit
 
01:28:43.189 --> 01:28:43.199 align:start position:0%
contract is the lion's share of that
 
01:28:45.830 --> 01:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
and that's the our system integrator our
 
01:28:48.149 --> 01:28:48.159 align:start position:0%
provider services our claims management
 
01:28:50.550 --> 01:28:50.560 align:start position:0%
system our third party liability
 
01:28:53.270 --> 01:28:53.280 align:start position:0%
our electronic data interface actually
 
01:28:54.950 --> 01:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
our data warehouse is in there
 
01:28:56.870 --> 01:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
in a number of other modules to support
 
01:28:58.390 --> 01:28:58.400 align:start position:0%
the medicaid program
 
01:29:01.110 --> 01:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
and that's actually if you estimate the
 
01:29:02.790 --> 01:29:02.800 align:start position:0%
number of people that are supporting
 
01:29:05.110 --> 01:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
that system from conduit it's upwards of
 
01:29:06.870 --> 01:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
130 people
 
01:29:08.790 --> 01:29:08.800 align:start position:0%
that are working on that system to
 
01:29:10.149 --> 01:29:10.159 align:start position:0%
support that
 
01:29:13.910 --> 01:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
work the the increase that you see from
 
01:29:15.590 --> 01:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
from a previous biennium to this
 
01:29:17.270 --> 01:29:17.280 align:start position:0%
biennium as a result
 
01:29:19.910 --> 01:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
of we were not funded for our operating
 
01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:20.470 align:start position:0%
of we were not funded for our operating
budget

01:29:20.470 --> 01:29:20.480 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:29:23.510 --> 01:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
in this current fiscal year i think
 
01:29:25.270 --> 01:29:25.280 align:start position:0%
karen or athena might be on to be able
 
01:29:27.030 --> 01:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
to tell that exact number
 
01:29:28.629 --> 01:29:28.639 align:start position:0%
but we're bringing that up to date so we
 
01:29:30.550 --> 01:29:30.560 align:start position:0%
are funded for the actual budget
 
01:29:34.070 --> 01:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
plus we have had a we have
 
01:29:36.229 --> 01:29:36.239 align:start position:0%
deferred maintenance on that system so
 
01:29:38.310 --> 01:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
our oracle our
 
01:29:40.790 --> 01:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
ibm licensing and pretty much all of our
 
01:29:42.550 --> 01:29:42.560 align:start position:0%
infrastructure for software
 
01:29:45.750 --> 01:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
is end of support and end of
 
01:29:48.950 --> 01:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
end of life which
 
01:29:50.870 --> 01:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
normally in some cases you could defer
 
01:29:52.390 --> 01:29:52.400 align:start position:0%
that maintenance and continue
 
01:29:55.189 --> 01:29:55.199 align:start position:0%
however it puts us at risk for um
 
01:29:57.270 --> 01:29:57.280 align:start position:0%
decertification from cms which would
 
01:29:57.990 --> 01:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
have a
 
01:30:00.870 --> 01:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
6.6 million dollar penalty on our
 
01:30:02.870 --> 01:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
general fund impacts
 
01:30:05.669 --> 01:30:05.679 align:start position:0%
so what we were what you have in there
 
01:30:07.110 --> 01:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
is actually the increased
 
01:30:09.830 --> 01:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
work is to do that life cycle management
 
01:30:11.830 --> 01:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
or that technical stack upgrade
 
01:30:13.990 --> 01:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
which i would say 70 percent of the work
 
01:30:15.189 --> 01:30:15.199 align:start position:0%
is conduit
 
01:30:19.510 --> 01:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
and then the other 30 is that doit dhhs
 
01:30:22.550 --> 01:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
combined team sort of strategically
 
01:30:25.430 --> 01:30:25.440 align:start position:0%
and and through leadership directing
 
01:30:27.669 --> 01:30:27.679 align:start position:0%
conduit to do the work
 
01:30:30.390 --> 01:30:30.400 align:start position:0%
and then the remaining contract the mtt
 
01:30:31.510 --> 01:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
data contract
 
01:30:33.430 --> 01:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
is the quality assurance contract that
 
01:30:34.870 --> 01:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
is required by
 
01:30:36.310 --> 01:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
center for medicaid and medicare
 
01:30:39.510 --> 01:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
services it did not increase
 
01:30:43.110 --> 01:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
this year it was but it is required
 
01:30:44.870 --> 01:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
for us to get our federal matching
 
01:30:46.950 --> 01:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
dollars to do a third party quality
 
01:30:48.709 --> 01:30:48.719 align:start position:0%
assurance review
 
01:30:52.070 --> 01:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
so so just to make sure i'm tracking
 
01:30:54.070 --> 01:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
this this is money you're paying a
 
01:30:57.030 --> 01:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
vendor to maintain your legacy system
 
01:31:00.390 --> 01:31:00.400 align:start position:0%
and your legacy system is old enough to
 
01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:00.790 align:start position:0%
and your legacy system is old enough to
where

01:31:00.790 --> 01:31:00.800 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:31:03.830 --> 01:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
you have critical components of it that
 
01:31:06.390 --> 01:31:06.400 align:start position:0%
are coming out coming towards their end
 
01:31:08.709 --> 01:31:08.719 align:start position:0%
of life end of support
 
01:31:12.550 --> 01:31:12.560 align:start position:0%
um so so and and and because of
 
01:31:14.790 --> 01:31:14.800 align:start position:0%
if we don't maintain it we're gonna
 
01:31:17.350 --> 01:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
potentially lose some cms
 
01:31:20.629 --> 01:31:20.639 align:start position:0%
certification due to what due to a lack
 
01:31:20.639 --> 01:31:21.590 align:start position:0%
certification due to what due to a lack
of

01:31:21.590 --> 01:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:31:24.310 --> 01:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
adequate security due to why would they
 
01:31:26.229 --> 01:31:26.239 align:start position:0%
remove our certification if the system
 
01:31:26.709 --> 01:31:26.719 align:start position:0%
is still
 
01:31:30.390 --> 01:31:30.400 align:start position:0%
operating so they require us to have
 
01:31:32.310 --> 01:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
support contracts with all of our
 
01:31:34.390 --> 01:31:34.400 align:start position:0%
vendors and maintaining patches of all
 
01:31:35.590 --> 01:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
the systems
 
01:31:38.390 --> 01:31:38.400 align:start position:0%
the ibm and oracle specifically um i
 
01:31:39.830 --> 01:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
could go through the other ones but
 
01:31:41.430 --> 01:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
those two companies
 
01:31:43.990 --> 01:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
have indicated in writing to conduit
 
01:31:46.149 --> 01:31:46.159 align:start position:0%
that they will not support the system
 
01:31:47.990 --> 01:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
nor will they provide critical patches
 
01:31:49.669 --> 01:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
for security or
 
01:31:53.430 --> 01:31:53.440 align:start position:0%
or function unless we upgrade and so
 
01:31:55.590 --> 01:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
and that that's where when they put that
 
01:31:58.149 --> 01:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
in writing which is basically the last
 
01:32:00.229 --> 01:32:00.239 align:start position:0%
last thing that the vendors do is when
 
01:32:02.390 --> 01:32:02.400 align:start position:0%
they do that then they
 
01:32:04.629 --> 01:32:04.639 align:start position:0%
then we're at risk where if conduit
 
01:32:05.750 --> 01:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
can't support it
 
01:32:08.709 --> 01:32:08.719 align:start position:0%
and it fails then the system would just
 
01:32:10.310 --> 01:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
fail and we would have no
 
01:32:14.629 --> 01:32:14.639 align:start position:0%
vendor vendor support um
 
01:32:16.470 --> 01:32:16.480 align:start position:0%
just to follow up again i'm sorry i
 
01:32:17.830 --> 01:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
don't know when do you guys have to
 
01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:18.229 align:start position:0%
don't know when do you guys have to
leave

01:32:18.229 --> 01:32:18.239 align:start position:0%
leave
 
01:32:20.550 --> 01:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
i i i know we don't want to talk all day
 
01:32:22.310 --> 01:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
about this but you all have a hard stop
 
01:32:25.030 --> 01:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
where you have to leave i think
 
01:32:29.110 --> 01:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
so so in the first year it's 12.5
 
01:32:30.709 --> 01:32:30.719 align:start position:0%
million basically in the second year
 
01:32:32.950 --> 01:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
it's 13.1
 
01:32:36.070 --> 01:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
um it sounds like you're saying that uh
 
01:32:39.030 --> 01:32:39.040 align:start position:0%
your vendor can provide you with an
 
01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:40.070 align:start position:0%
your vendor can provide you with an
upgrade

01:32:40.070 --> 01:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
upgrade
 
01:32:44.070 --> 01:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
that will bring those component licenses
 
01:32:47.110 --> 01:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
up to date and therefore remain
 
01:32:51.110 --> 01:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:53.189 --> 01:32:53.199 align:start position:0%
that is correct there are a couple other
 
01:32:55.669 --> 01:32:55.679 align:start position:0%
components that were in our testimony
 
01:32:58.709 --> 01:32:58.719 align:start position:0%
earlier um that this money also supports
 
01:33:00.070 --> 01:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
which is
 
01:33:02.629 --> 01:33:02.639 align:start position:0%
by a cms passed interoperability and
 
01:33:04.149 --> 01:33:04.159 align:start position:0%
patient access final rule
 
01:33:07.350 --> 01:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
that impacted both mmis as well as that
 
01:33:08.950 --> 01:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
earlier conversation with the emission
 
01:33:10.950 --> 01:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
discharge transfer system
 
01:33:14.390 --> 01:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
where we needed to put in place changes
 
01:33:17.189 --> 01:33:17.199 align:start position:0%
in the mmis for member access to data
 
01:33:19.030 --> 01:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
so a component of this general fund
 
01:33:21.030 --> 01:33:21.040 align:start position:0%
increase is the the annual
 
01:33:22.629 --> 01:33:22.639 align:start position:0%
maintenance for that which is estimated
 
01:33:24.870 --> 01:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
at 900 000 per year
 
01:33:27.110 --> 01:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
to support that um those changes from
 
01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:28.550 align:start position:0%
to support that um those changes from
cms

01:33:28.550 --> 01:33:28.560 align:start position:0%
cms
 
01:33:31.830 --> 01:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
as well as there's penalties in here for
 
01:33:32.470 --> 01:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
us not
 
01:33:34.149 --> 01:33:34.159 align:start position:0%
implemented the electronic visit
 
01:33:35.669 --> 01:33:35.679 align:start position:0%
verification in
 
01:33:39.030 --> 01:33:39.040 align:start position:0%
by january 1st 2021 and we didn't
 
01:33:41.270 --> 01:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
implement that as a result of not having
 
01:33:43.110 --> 01:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
the funds approved in the previous
 
01:33:44.629 --> 01:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
biennium capital
 
01:33:47.910 --> 01:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
request and and that's why you see the
 
01:33:51.430 --> 01:33:51.440 align:start position:0%
increase in general fund um allocation
 
01:33:51.440 --> 01:33:52.149 align:start position:0%
increase in general fund um allocation
from

01:33:52.149 --> 01:33:52.159 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:33:54.870 --> 01:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
22 to 23. the penalties come from how
 
01:33:55.910 --> 01:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
much did that cost
 
01:33:57.830 --> 01:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
us how much do that penalty cost us do
 
01:33:59.110 --> 01:33:59.120 align:start position:0%
you know before it is
 
01:34:02.470 --> 01:34:02.480 align:start position:0%
miss rounds now the estimated um
 
01:34:05.510 --> 01:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
i'll go ahead karen no go ahead dave the
 
01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:06.310 align:start position:0%
i'll go ahead karen no go ahead dave the
estimated

01:34:06.310 --> 01:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
estimated
 
01:34:09.350 --> 01:34:09.360 align:start position:0%
um impacts for
 
01:34:14.470 --> 01:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
this this this coming year is 864 000
 
01:34:16.629 --> 01:34:16.639 align:start position:0%
and then the following year is 1.3
 
01:34:18.629 --> 01:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
million dollars in penalties
 
01:34:21.830 --> 01:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
of which the evv system to avoid those
 
01:34:22.950 --> 01:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
penalties is
 
01:34:25.830 --> 01:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
and those are general fund penalties the
 
01:34:27.910 --> 01:34:27.920 align:start position:0%
general fund costs to implement an ebv
 
01:34:28.629 --> 01:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
system is
 
01:34:31.830 --> 01:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
is estimated at 564
 
01:34:35.590 --> 01:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
yeah okay i
 
01:34:37.750 --> 01:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
i i guess i have one more question
 
01:34:38.790 --> 01:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
around the the
 
01:34:41.990 --> 01:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
25 million over the biennium
 
01:34:45.189 --> 01:34:45.199 align:start position:0%
do you it sounds to me like you've
 
01:34:48.149 --> 01:34:48.159 align:start position:0%
talked to your vendors and these are
 
01:34:49.750 --> 01:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
these are really firm
 
01:34:52.310 --> 01:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
price estimates for the contract
 
01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:55.669 align:start position:0%
price estimates for the contract
modifications

01:34:55.669 --> 01:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:57.750 --> 01:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
or are they are they still estimates
 
01:35:00.470 --> 01:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
these look pretty precise and it sounds
 
01:35:01.430 --> 01:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
like you're saying
 
01:35:02.950 --> 01:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
you've come to an agreement with your
 
01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:04.470 align:start position:0%
you've come to an agreement with your
vendors

01:35:04.470 --> 01:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
vendors
 
01:35:06.470 --> 01:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
they were precise estimates at the time
 
01:35:07.830 --> 01:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
of submittal however
 
01:35:10.149 --> 01:35:10.159 align:start position:0%
since the middle i continue to work on
 
01:35:11.590 --> 01:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
negotiations to
 
01:35:14.550 --> 01:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
reduce those costs we haven't finalized
 
01:35:15.830 --> 01:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
the contracts
 
01:35:18.870 --> 01:35:18.880 align:start position:0%
so the final contract should be coming
 
01:35:20.790 --> 01:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
to the governor executive council for
 
01:35:23.109 --> 01:35:23.119 align:start position:0%
approval within the next
 
01:35:25.189 --> 01:35:25.199 align:start position:0%
month and a half at which time we will
 
01:35:25.199 --> 01:35:26.870 align:start position:0%
month and a half at which time we will
have

01:35:26.870 --> 01:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:35:30.470 --> 01:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
um have those numbers
 
01:35:32.310 --> 01:35:32.320 align:start position:0%
i won't ask you what you're expecting
 
01:35:33.750 --> 01:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
for a reduction because
 
01:35:35.590 --> 01:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
i don't want to lock you in and just
 
01:35:37.030 --> 01:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
saying a number is going to do that
 
01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:38.149 align:start position:0%
saying a number is going to do that
effectively

01:35:38.149 --> 01:35:38.159 align:start position:0%
effectively
 
01:35:41.350 --> 01:35:41.360 align:start position:0%
but can you can you tell me for sure
 
01:35:44.310 --> 01:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
that it's you're in a not to exceed
 
01:35:45.830 --> 01:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
position with these numbers
 
01:35:47.910 --> 01:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
and that you may end up coming in less
 
01:35:49.109 --> 01:35:49.119 align:start position:0%
and as a result
 
01:35:51.270 --> 01:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
some of this may lapse back to the
 
01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:55.830 align:start position:0%
some of this may lapse back to the
treasury

01:35:55.830 --> 01:35:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:57.669 --> 01:35:57.679 align:start position:0%
i would i would defer to carrying on
 
01:35:59.189 --> 01:35:59.199 align:start position:0%
that i'll comment because i
 
01:36:02.550 --> 01:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
i don't get involved in the labs process
 
01:36:07.750 --> 01:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:09.990 --> 01:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
okay so representative irf do you have
 
01:36:11.669 --> 01:36:11.679 align:start position:0%
any questions does anyone on the
 
01:36:16.870 --> 01:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:19.669 --> 01:36:19.679 align:start position:0%
uh representative irf you're recognized
 
01:36:21.189 --> 01:36:21.199 align:start position:0%
just to clarify i think this is what you
 
01:36:22.709 --> 01:36:22.719 align:start position:0%
were saying looking back at the
 
01:36:25.109 --> 01:36:25.119 align:start position:0%
prior biennium's budget and it showed
 
01:36:27.270 --> 01:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
three million dollars budgeted for both
 
01:36:29.590 --> 01:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
20 and 21 which seems consistent what
 
01:36:31.109 --> 01:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
you show for the
 
01:36:32.790 --> 01:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
adjusted actual for 21 general fund
 
01:36:35.510 --> 01:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
dollars i'm talking
 
01:36:37.430 --> 01:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
i'm guessing you were aware of these
 
01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:39.030 align:start position:0%
i'm guessing you were aware of these
concerns

01:36:39.030 --> 01:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
01:36:41.990 --> 01:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
two years ago and and you made them
 
01:36:44.070 --> 01:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
awareness i just can't recall
 
01:36:46.149 --> 01:36:46.159 align:start position:0%
uh and and you just the plans weren't
 
01:36:47.910 --> 01:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
allocated so you couldn't take advantage
 
01:36:48.709 --> 01:36:48.719 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:36:52.870 --> 01:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
last two years to start this process
 
01:36:54.870 --> 01:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative erf and chair
 
01:36:56.310 --> 01:36:56.320 align:start position:0%
for the question d
 
01:36:58.550 --> 01:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
um over the last two bienniums
 
01:36:58.560 --> 01:36:59.750 align:start position:0%
um over the last two bienniums
previously

01:36:59.750 --> 01:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
previously
 
01:37:02.550 --> 01:37:02.560 align:start position:0%
specifically for biennium 2021 we did
 
01:37:04.149 --> 01:37:04.159 align:start position:0%
submit a capital project for
 
01:37:06.870 --> 01:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
mmis lifecycle management it might have
 
01:37:08.310 --> 01:37:08.320 align:start position:0%
been named something different it was
 
01:37:09.189 --> 01:37:09.199 align:start position:0%
not funded
 
01:37:11.189 --> 01:37:11.199 align:start position:0%
so we need we deferred mate we continued
 
01:37:12.790 --> 01:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
to defer maintenance
 
01:37:15.750 --> 01:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
the previous biennium we had a capital
 
01:37:15.760 --> 01:37:16.709 align:start position:0%
the previous biennium we had a capital
request

01:37:16.709 --> 01:37:16.719 align:start position:0%
request
 
01:37:19.189 --> 01:37:19.199 align:start position:0%
that was to do all of the work we were
 
01:37:21.270 --> 01:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
funded at a fraction of that
 
01:37:24.470 --> 01:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
and at an amount of i think 26 million
 
01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:24.870 align:start position:0%
and at an amount of i think 26 million
we

01:37:24.870 --> 01:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:37:27.510 --> 01:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
initially asked for upwards of 50
 
01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:28.310 align:start position:0%
initially asked for upwards of 50
million

01:37:28.310 --> 01:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:37:31.510 --> 01:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
to do the work and so we have been
 
01:37:33.669 --> 01:37:33.679 align:start position:0%
requesting over time to get the capital
 
01:37:34.390 --> 01:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
funds to
 
01:37:37.750 --> 01:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
maintain the system and in
 
01:37:41.750 --> 01:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
in the case in the case of uh
 
01:37:43.910 --> 01:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
the the capital budgets we were not
 
01:37:45.669 --> 01:37:45.679 align:start position:0%
funded to do this so we continue to
 
01:37:46.629 --> 01:37:46.639 align:start position:0%
bring them up
 
01:37:49.590 --> 01:37:49.600 align:start position:0%
to the capital group for public public
 
01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:50.470 align:start position:0%
to the capital group for public public
works

01:37:50.470 --> 01:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
works
 
01:37:53.030 --> 01:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
review and then associate with capital
 
01:37:55.030 --> 01:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
there's always operating costs after you
 
01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:55.990 align:start position:0%
there's always operating costs after you
implement

01:37:55.990 --> 01:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
implement
 
01:38:00.390 --> 01:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
so the the i and i think i saw something
 
01:38:01.350 --> 01:38:01.360 align:start position:0%
in the chat so
 
01:38:03.910 --> 01:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
maybe someone can reflect i believe the
 
01:38:05.590 --> 01:38:05.600 align:start position:0%
three million that you're referring to
 
01:38:07.750 --> 01:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
is the adopted budget versus what we
 
01:38:09.270 --> 01:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
actually submitted
 
01:38:12.470 --> 01:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
um we brought forward close to seven
 
01:38:14.229 --> 01:38:14.239 align:start position:0%
million dollars to continue paying for
 
01:38:15.990 --> 01:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
mmis as well as transferred
 
01:38:17.750 --> 01:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
in another six and a half in general
 
01:38:17.760 --> 01:38:20.390 align:start position:0%
in another six and a half in general
funds

01:38:20.390 --> 01:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:22.790 --> 01:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
so so the cost was much higher than what
 
01:38:25.510 --> 01:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:27.990 --> 01:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
so some so mr glay you're just part of a
 
01:38:30.070 --> 01:38:30.080 align:start position:0%
conversation here if you want to if you
 
01:38:31.430 --> 01:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
want to
 
01:38:34.550 --> 01:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
add comment go ahead sir well um
 
01:38:37.350 --> 01:38:37.360 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the conversation about the
 
01:38:38.870 --> 01:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
life cycle considerations and the
 
01:38:40.550 --> 01:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
deferred maintenance
 
01:38:43.270 --> 01:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
and and it was a bit of a theoretic in
 
01:38:44.870 --> 01:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
my view it was a
 
01:38:47.750 --> 01:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
good financial conversation i want to
 
01:38:48.470 --> 01:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
bring in the
 
01:38:51.990 --> 01:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
the aspect of um these this deferred
 
01:38:53.430 --> 01:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
maintenance putting us in
 
01:38:55.669 --> 01:38:55.679 align:start position:0%
a position where uh stuff isn't being
 
01:38:57.350 --> 01:38:57.360 align:start position:0%
passed for security reasons
 
01:38:59.910 --> 01:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
that represents a risk of citizen data
 
01:39:01.510 --> 01:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
as well and i want to make sure that
 
01:39:04.149 --> 01:39:04.159 align:start position:0%
that's in the public record that that
 
01:39:05.270 --> 01:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
you know it's our all of our
 
01:39:07.030 --> 01:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to do our best to
 
01:39:08.470 --> 01:39:08.480 align:start position:0%
protect citizen data
 
01:39:10.790 --> 01:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
and this is sensitive citizen data and
 
01:39:12.629 --> 01:39:12.639 align:start position:0%
it's really important that we
 
01:39:15.830 --> 01:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
that we fund this um this
 
01:39:19.990 --> 01:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
refresh to i think do what is our basic
 
01:39:22.470 --> 01:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
uh to perform our basic responsibility
 
01:39:23.030 --> 01:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
in that
 
01:39:25.590 --> 01:39:25.600 align:start position:0%
in that role so just to make sure i
 
01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:26.149 align:start position:0%
in that role so just to make sure i
understand

01:39:26.149 --> 01:39:26.159 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:39:27.990 --> 01:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
that risk you're laying out there for us
 
01:39:30.870 --> 01:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
i i assume that one source of that
 
01:39:33.990 --> 01:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
risk is if we have an oracle database
 
01:39:35.910 --> 01:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
with sensitive data in it and it's
 
01:39:35.920 --> 01:39:36.470 align:start position:0%
with sensitive data in it and it's
beyond

01:39:36.470 --> 01:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
beyond
 
01:39:38.390 --> 01:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
its service support and therefore it's
 
01:39:40.870 --> 01:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
not getting patches it's not getting the
 
01:39:43.109 --> 01:39:43.119 align:start position:0%
security patches that it needs
 
01:39:46.950 --> 01:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
and therefore as we age past that
 
01:39:50.070 --> 01:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
we become increasingly vulnerable as
 
01:39:51.430 --> 01:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
hackers get to know of our
 
01:39:53.430 --> 01:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
vulnerabilities that
 
01:39:58.470 --> 01:39:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:01.590 --> 01:40:01.600 align:start position:0%
is still up are there any other uh uh
 
01:40:04.950 --> 01:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
questions here uh mr lipman you've uh
 
01:40:07.270 --> 01:40:07.280 align:start position:0%
you've joined us i appreciate it and i'm
 
01:40:08.709 --> 01:40:08.719 align:start position:0%
sorry for all the tech talk
 
01:40:10.709 --> 01:40:10.719 align:start position:0%
but do you have something you'd like to
 
01:40:10.719 --> 01:40:11.830 align:start position:0%
but do you have something you'd like to
answer

01:40:11.830 --> 01:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
answer
 
01:40:13.990 --> 01:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
i would i just say that the risk that
 
01:40:16.390 --> 01:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
dennis uh spoke about
 
01:40:20.229 --> 01:40:20.239 align:start position:0%
the risk to our provider network of not
 
01:40:21.430 --> 01:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
being able to
 
01:40:23.270 --> 01:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
perform in the risk of the state budget
 
01:40:25.270 --> 01:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
i think there are a lot of risks here
 
01:40:27.270 --> 01:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
that were maybe two years ago when the
 
01:40:28.870 --> 01:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
budget was considering maybe
 
01:40:30.390 --> 01:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
seemed a little bit theoretical now
 
01:40:32.070 --> 01:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
they're real and um
 
01:40:34.830 --> 01:40:34.840 align:start position:0%
we really need your support on this
 
01:40:34.840 --> 01:40:36.950 align:start position:0%
we really need your support on this
request

01:40:36.950 --> 01:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
request
 
01:40:38.390 --> 01:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
you still have something thank you sir
 
01:40:40.149 --> 01:40:40.159 align:start position:0%
do you still have something for us mr
 
01:40:40.159 --> 01:40:42.950 align:start position:0%
do you still have something for us mr
gillette

01:40:42.950 --> 01:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:44.470 --> 01:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
you get your hands up i don't want to
 
01:40:46.310 --> 01:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
ignore it yeah you were
 
01:40:48.070 --> 01:40:48.080 align:start position:0%
you called on me right after i put my
 
01:40:50.149 --> 01:40:50.159 align:start position:0%
hand up so i thought that was
 
01:40:51.590 --> 01:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
you were just really quick on that but
 
01:40:54.470 --> 01:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
no i'm good thank you sir
 
01:40:57.830 --> 01:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
um all right i i do want to put one
 
01:40:58.950 --> 01:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
thing on the record
 
01:41:02.709 --> 01:41:02.719 align:start position:0%
um since the last time i think i did a
 
01:41:04.870 --> 01:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
zoom with mr weeders
 
01:41:08.950 --> 01:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
on on the call i i've had
 
01:41:12.470 --> 01:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
two random resumes sent to me
 
01:41:15.189 --> 01:41:15.199 align:start position:0%
by people interested in going to work
 
01:41:15.199 --> 01:41:15.510 align:start position:0%
by people interested in going to work
for

01:41:15.510 --> 01:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:41:17.669 --> 01:41:17.679 align:start position:0%
the department and i don't know who

your hand is still up so i'll just keep
 
01:42:31.669 --> 01:42:31.679 align:start position:0%
coming back to you until you put it down
 
01:42:34.870 --> 01:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:38.149 --> 01:42:38.159 align:start position:0%
all right so um are there any
 
01:42:41.350 --> 01:42:41.360 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee um
 
01:42:44.149 --> 01:42:44.159 align:start position:0%
all right so i i think this was
 
01:42:45.990 --> 01:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
important testimony like i i
 
01:42:49.910 --> 01:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
i and we probably have heard all of this
 
01:42:53.189 --> 01:42:53.199 align:start position:0%
once before but the importance of
 
01:42:54.149 --> 01:42:54.159 align:start position:0%
hearing it
 
01:42:57.510 --> 01:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh increased when we went through a
 
01:42:58.790 --> 01:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
budget exercise
 
01:43:01.669 --> 01:43:01.679 align:start position:0%
and we found this money right at the
 
01:43:01.679 --> 01:43:02.629 align:start position:0%
and we found this money right at the
cusp

01:43:02.629 --> 01:43:02.639 align:start position:0%
cusp
 
01:43:05.590 --> 01:43:05.600 align:start position:0%
of what we considered to be available
 
01:43:06.550 --> 01:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
for investment
 
01:43:10.070 --> 01:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
so um so it was i think it's important
 
01:43:11.350 --> 01:43:11.360 align:start position:0%
that you came in and you
 
01:43:13.109 --> 01:43:13.119 align:start position:0%
and you brought us back up to speed and
 
01:43:15.030 --> 01:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
reminded us of stuff that we
 
01:43:18.070 --> 01:43:18.080 align:start position:0%
maybe had forgotten so um
 
01:43:20.470 --> 01:43:20.480 align:start position:0%
i wha what section have we been talking
 
01:43:22.229 --> 01:43:22.239 align:start position:0%
about is this section 30
 
01:43:25.430 --> 01:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh we did talk about 30 38
 
01:43:28.070 --> 01:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
and then this has just been the mis
 
01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:29.270 align:start position:0%
and then this has just been the mis
budget

01:43:29.270 --> 01:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:43:32.550 --> 01:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
i unless you guys have any uh
 
01:43:35.189 --> 01:43:35.199 align:start position:0%
or gals if there's a gal out there uh if

01:43:39.350 --> 01:43:39.360 align:start position:0%
questions or comments before we we move
 
01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:39.990 align:start position:0%
questions or comments before we we move
on

01:43:39.990 --> 01:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:43:44.550 --> 01:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:45.910 --> 01:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
do we have any questions from the
 
01:43:48.470 --> 01:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
committee i for some reason i'm
 
01:43:52.550 --> 01:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
my view is not as good as it normally is
 
01:43:53.910 --> 01:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
i don't see any questions from the
 
01:43:55.910 --> 01:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
committee and i'm not seeing any
 
01:43:58.950 --> 01:43:58.960 align:start position:0%

01:44:13.440 --> 01:44:14.470 align:start position:0%
uh i think the next section is the
section

01:44:14.470 --> 01:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:44:16.629 --> 01:44:16.639 align:start position:0%
uh with alvarez and marcel and there are
 
01:44:17.669 --> 01:44:17.679 align:start position:0%
several people that
 
01:44:19.910 --> 01:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
kevin needs to bring over so might i
 
01:44:20.790 --> 01:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
request a
 
01:44:23.430 --> 01:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
five-minute break while we do that and
 
01:44:26.070 --> 01:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
have a chance to use the restroom
 
01:44:27.830 --> 01:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for pointing that out i
 
01:44:29.510 --> 01:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate that let's
 
01:44:33.030 --> 01:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
let's do that it's uh it's 11 15
 
01:44:36.390 --> 01:44:36.400 align:start position:0%
and we'll start back up at around 11 20.
 
01:44:38.390 --> 01:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
great and if the a m attendees could
 
01:44:39.590 --> 01:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
raise their hand that would make it a
 
01:44:41.109 --> 01:44:41.119 align:start position:0%
little easier for kevin i sent him the
 
01:44:42.470 --> 01:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
list of names but that will make it
 
01:44:42.480 --> 01:44:44.470 align:start position:0%
list of names but that will make it
easier

01:44:44.470 --> 01:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
easier
 
01:44:47.189 --> 01:44:47.199 align:start position:0%
you have a document that kevin can share
 
01:44:49.030 --> 01:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
that'd be great too
 
01:44:51.590 --> 01:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
um i am i'm prepared to screen share if
 
01:44:51.600 --> 01:44:52.070 align:start position:0%
um i am i'm prepared to screen share if
that

01:44:52.070 --> 01:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:44:54.470 --> 01:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
makes it easier for kevin it does it
 
01:44:56.310 --> 01:44:56.320 align:start position:0%
does thank you
 
01:44:58.310 --> 01:44:58.320 align:start position:0%
uh just whatever you're sharing i would
 
01:45:00.470 --> 01:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
probably need to put on the lba website
 
01:45:01.350 --> 01:45:01.360 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:45:02.550 --> 01:45:02.560 align:start position:0%
i'm actually going to pull it right off
 
01:49:32.550 --> 01:49:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:35.830 --> 01:49:35.840 align:start position:0%

all right so i'm gonna
 
01:49:51.990 --> 01:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:55.430 --> 01:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
so i'm gonna start over here this is
 
01:49:59.430 --> 01:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
um section 35 is the section
 
01:50:00.950 --> 01:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about here this is
 
01:50:02.870 --> 01:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
the 10 million
 
01:50:06.629 --> 01:50:06.639 align:start position:0%
43 000 dollars meant to implement
 
01:50:09.750 --> 01:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
the a m um
 
01:50:13.350 --> 01:50:13.360 align:start position:0%
findings so going over
 
01:50:17.189 --> 01:50:17.199 align:start position:0%
to the lba website here
 
01:50:20.390 --> 01:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
this is where you'll find the reports
 
01:50:22.830 --> 01:50:22.840 align:start position:0%
uh what i would mention here is there
 
01:50:22.840 --> 01:50:24.070 align:start position:0%
uh what i would mention here is there
are

01:50:24.070 --> 01:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:50:26.709 --> 01:50:26.719 align:start position:0%
the report and the presentation for one
 
01:50:26.719 --> 01:50:27.350 align:start position:0%
the report and the presentation for one
a

01:50:27.350 --> 01:50:27.360 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:50:29.669 --> 01:50:29.679 align:start position:0%
and then one b uh the report and the
 
01:50:31.430 --> 01:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
presentation for each of the phases are
 
01:50:32.709 --> 01:50:32.719 align:start position:0%
very similar
 
01:50:34.470 --> 01:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
so it's really about what your reading
 
01:50:36.629 --> 01:50:36.639 align:start position:0%
preference is if you prefer to
 
01:50:39.669 --> 01:50:39.679 align:start position:0%
read slides or narrative uh
 
01:50:42.390 --> 01:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
but what you will find in the reports
 
01:50:42.400 --> 01:50:42.870 align:start position:0%
but what you will find in the reports
are

01:50:42.870 --> 01:50:42.880 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:50:46.390 --> 01:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
is virtually identical it's more just a
 
01:50:49.270 --> 01:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
um what kind of what level of detail you
 
01:50:51.350 --> 01:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
like to read and how you like to
 
01:50:53.910 --> 01:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
read it the other item which i'm going
 
01:50:56.790 --> 01:50:56.800 align:start position:0%
to pull up on the screen here is item 11
 
01:51:00.070 --> 01:51:00.080 align:start position:0%
which is uh tying back to that funding
 
01:51:03.109 --> 01:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
that's listed in hb2 and
 
01:51:05.910 --> 01:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
as long as the chair is good with it i
 
01:51:05.920 --> 01:51:06.470 align:start position:0%
as long as the chair is good with it i
um

01:51:06.470 --> 01:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:09.189 --> 01:51:09.199 align:start position:0%

week as we understand
 
01:52:12.229 --> 01:52:12.239 align:start position:0%
so our team was brought in to conduct an
 
01:52:12.239 --> 01:52:13.430 align:start position:0%
so our team was brought in to conduct an
assessment

01:52:13.430 --> 01:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
01:52:15.990 --> 01:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
of the various programs that dhhs
 
01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:17.430 align:start position:0%
of the various programs that dhhs
administers

01:52:17.430 --> 01:52:17.440 align:start position:0%
administers
 
01:52:20.790 --> 01:52:20.800 align:start position:0%
and oversees to identify potential
 
01:52:20.800 --> 01:52:22.310 align:start position:0%
and oversees to identify potential
opportunities

01:52:22.310 --> 01:52:22.320 align:start position:0%
opportunities
 
01:52:24.390 --> 01:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
for increasing efficiency and
 
01:52:25.990 --> 01:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of all these available
 
01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:27.510 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of all these available
services

01:52:27.510 --> 01:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:52:31.109 --> 01:52:31.119 align:start position:0%
with a particular focus on how covet 19
 
01:52:34.709 --> 01:52:34.719 align:start position:0%
has impacted these areas of service and
 
01:52:37.589 --> 01:52:37.599 align:start position:0%
for this assessment we relied on the
 
01:52:39.990 --> 01:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
data from the department systems
 
01:52:42.709 --> 01:52:42.719 align:start position:0%
policy and program documentation best
 
01:52:44.550 --> 01:52:44.560 align:start position:0%
practices as well as the
 
01:52:48.310 --> 01:52:48.320 align:start position:0%
experience of our subject matter experts
 
01:52:50.390 --> 01:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
to identify to get a firm understanding
 
01:52:52.390 --> 01:52:52.400 align:start position:0%
of how these programs are performing
 
01:52:53.669 --> 01:52:53.679 align:start position:0%
where there and where there might be
 
01:52:56.149 --> 01:52:56.159 align:start position:0%
opportunities to improve
 
01:52:59.430 --> 01:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
and so we outlined requirements um to
 
01:53:01.189 --> 01:53:01.199 align:start position:0%
implement recommendations
 
01:53:04.550 --> 01:53:04.560 align:start position:0%
to address those opportunities
 
01:53:07.910 --> 01:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
and where possible we've provided roi
 
01:53:11.270 --> 01:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
estimates as well so we focused our
 
01:53:12.950 --> 01:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
recommendations in a couple different
 
01:53:12.960 --> 01:53:14.310 align:start position:0%
recommendations in a couple different
areas

01:53:14.310 --> 01:53:14.320 align:start position:0%
areas
 
01:53:17.030 --> 01:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
long-term supports and services more
 
01:53:19.910 --> 01:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
specifically developmental disabilities
 
01:53:22.470 --> 01:53:22.480 align:start position:0%
as well as behavioral health and we
 
01:53:24.550 --> 01:53:24.560 align:start position:0%
found that our recommendations
 
01:53:26.629 --> 01:53:26.639 align:start position:0%
as they emerged fell into two broader
 
01:53:26.639 --> 01:53:27.910 align:start position:0%
as they emerged fell into two broader
categories

01:53:27.910 --> 01:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
categories
 
01:53:30.550 --> 01:53:30.560 align:start position:0%
um specifically shorter term
 
01:53:31.990 --> 01:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
opportunities that can be implemented
 
01:53:33.589 --> 01:53:33.599 align:start position:0%
within one to two years
 
01:53:35.510 --> 01:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
this is this is really the case with the
 
01:53:37.189 --> 01:53:37.199 align:start position:0%
the recommendations
 
01:53:40.229 --> 01:53:40.239 align:start position:0%
related to behavioral health as well as
 
01:53:41.669 --> 01:53:41.679 align:start position:0%
the opportunities related to
 
01:53:43.669 --> 01:53:43.679 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities which
 
01:53:46.229 --> 01:53:46.239 align:start position:0%
while we see as pressing to address
 
01:53:47.910 --> 01:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
would require longer term
 
01:53:52.229 --> 01:53:52.239 align:start position:0%
implementation phases to accomplish
 
01:53:55.669 --> 01:53:55.679 align:start position:0%
and so the result of this process
 
01:53:58.790 --> 01:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
um coming out of this report is that the
 
01:53:58.800 --> 01:53:59.589 align:start position:0%
um coming out of this report is that the
department

01:53:59.589 --> 01:53:59.599 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:54:03.589 --> 01:54:03.599 align:start position:0%
has proposed these projects
 
01:54:06.310 --> 01:54:06.320 align:start position:0%
in their budget package this this list
 
01:54:07.990 --> 01:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
is really narrowed down to include
 
01:54:09.910 --> 01:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
the projects which we feel the
 
01:54:11.270 --> 01:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
department can
 
01:54:14.070 --> 01:54:14.080 align:start position:0%
implement but would require support to
 
01:54:15.589 --> 01:54:15.599 align:start position:0%
do so
 
01:54:17.430 --> 01:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
but which will provide substantive
 
01:54:19.910 --> 01:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
impacts to the service delivery
 
01:54:23.109 --> 01:54:23.119 align:start position:0%
system as a whole
 
01:54:26.709 --> 01:54:26.719 align:start position:0%
to follow my remarks here we have
 
01:54:29.189 --> 01:54:29.199 align:start position:0%
included members of our team today who
 
01:54:30.629 --> 01:54:30.639 align:start position:0%
are prepared to provide
 
01:54:33.430 --> 01:54:33.440 align:start position:0%
a brief but more specific description of
 
01:54:34.629 --> 01:54:34.639 align:start position:0%
each of these projects
 
01:54:37.030 --> 01:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
in the proposed budget package as well
 
01:54:38.790 --> 01:54:38.800 align:start position:0%
as to answer questions that you all may
 
01:54:38.800 --> 01:54:41.430 align:start position:0%
as to answer questions that you all may
have

01:54:41.430 --> 01:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:43.109 --> 01:54:43.119 align:start position:0%
let me let me make sure i understand
 
01:54:44.950 --> 01:54:44.960 align:start position:0%
your your use of the term
 
01:54:48.470 --> 01:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
budget package are these are these
 
01:54:51.669 --> 01:54:51.679 align:start position:0%
uh i i'm seeing five line items here
 
01:54:54.790 --> 01:54:54.800 align:start position:0%
are these five budget packages or or
 
01:54:57.589 --> 01:54:57.599 align:start position:0%
is this one rolled into one and do we
 
01:55:00.470 --> 01:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
already have the hb2 language inserted
 
01:55:00.480 --> 01:55:01.189 align:start position:0%
already have the hb2 language inserted
as

01:55:01.189 --> 01:55:01.199 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:55:03.669 --> 01:55:03.679 align:start position:0%
we don't have the hb2 language inserted
 
01:55:05.350 --> 01:55:05.360 align:start position:0%
yet do we
 
01:55:08.709 --> 01:55:08.719 align:start position:0%
no this is all part of um
 
01:55:12.070 --> 01:55:12.080 align:start position:0%
this item here so the
 
01:55:15.350 --> 01:55:15.360 align:start position:0%
the 10 million 43 000
 
01:55:17.350 --> 01:55:17.360 align:start position:0%
uh obviously is a little bit less than
 
01:55:19.430 --> 01:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
the 10 million 260 000
 
01:55:22.149 --> 01:55:22.159 align:start position:0%
so we would have to work within um what
 
01:55:24.709 --> 01:55:24.719 align:start position:0%
the governor did appropriate in hb2
 
01:55:27.750 --> 01:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh but all of them are funded as all of
 
01:55:29.430 --> 01:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
these are technically funded as part of
 
01:55:31.350 --> 01:55:31.360 align:start position:0%
that hb2 appropriation
 
01:55:35.910 --> 01:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:37.910 --> 01:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
and so what i'll do is i can cover the
 
01:55:38.950 --> 01:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
first one here
 
01:55:41.350 --> 01:55:41.360 align:start position:0%
uh the 4e funding because before you get
 
01:55:43.270 --> 01:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
going this is a good place to let
 
01:55:47.990 --> 01:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:51.109 --> 01:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
so are these also already incorporated
 
01:55:54.229 --> 01:55:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:56.550 --> 01:55:56.560 align:start position:0%
they are the cop these no they are not
 
01:55:57.990 --> 01:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
double budgeted
 
01:56:02.550 --> 01:56:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:05.589 --> 01:56:05.599 align:start position:0%
i don't see any other questions great
 
01:56:07.350 --> 01:56:07.360 align:start position:0%
so what i'm going to do is just cover
 
01:56:08.709 --> 01:56:08.719 align:start position:0%
the first one and then
 
01:56:10.950 --> 01:56:10.960 align:start position:0%
i will turn it over back over to
 
01:56:11.990 --> 01:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
different members of the a
 
01:56:14.470 --> 01:56:14.480 align:start position:0%
m team to cover each of the others to
 
01:56:15.669 --> 01:56:15.679 align:start position:0%
talk about
 
01:56:18.709 --> 01:56:18.719 align:start position:0%
um why this project's important and uh
 
01:56:21.910 --> 01:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
the return on investment so the first
 
01:56:21.920 --> 01:56:22.470 align:start position:0%
the return on investment so the first
one

01:56:22.470 --> 01:56:22.480 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:56:23.750 --> 01:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
and the reason i'm talking about this
 
01:56:25.589 --> 01:56:25.599 align:start position:0%
first one is because as division three
 
01:56:26.790 --> 01:56:26.800 align:start position:0%
members remember from
 
01:56:29.669 --> 01:56:29.679 align:start position:0%
last biennium this is one that's near
 
01:56:30.950 --> 01:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
and dear to my heart
 
01:56:32.709 --> 01:56:32.719 align:start position:0%
we knew that there was a problem with
 
01:56:35.030 --> 01:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
our 4e funding we knew that our claiming
 
01:56:36.390 --> 01:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
rates were lower
 
01:56:38.470 --> 01:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
than states around us but we were really
 
01:56:40.229 --> 01:56:40.239 align:start position:0%
struggling to identify
 
01:56:42.950 --> 01:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
what our issues were and so a m was able
 
01:56:45.109 --> 01:56:45.119 align:start position:0%
to do some analysis and help us
 
01:56:47.270 --> 01:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
develop some processes that are going to
 
01:56:48.550 --> 01:56:48.560 align:start position:0%
improve that
 
01:56:50.790 --> 01:56:50.800 align:start position:0%
so we do need to make some small changes
 
01:56:52.709 --> 01:56:52.719 align:start position:0%
to our computer systems
 
01:56:56.070 --> 01:56:56.080 align:start position:0%
uh to be able to implement those changes
 
01:56:59.430 --> 01:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
there is an anticipated
 
01:57:01.910 --> 01:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
roi of anywhere from two to four million
 
01:57:03.990 --> 01:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
dollars a year in general funds which is
 
01:57:06.470 --> 01:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
fairly significant uh the governor's
 
01:57:07.750 --> 01:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
office and i talked
 
01:57:10.470 --> 01:57:10.480 align:start position:0%
uh quite extensively about how to
 
01:57:12.149 --> 01:57:12.159 align:start position:0%
include it in the budget
 
01:57:14.470 --> 01:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
uh my recommendation was to increase the
 
01:57:15.589 --> 01:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
department's laps
 
01:57:17.189 --> 01:57:17.199 align:start position:0%
because we're not sure exactly what the
 
01:57:18.709 --> 01:57:18.719 align:start position:0%
timeline might be
 
01:57:21.189 --> 01:57:21.199 align:start position:0%
for making that and as representative
 
01:57:23.189 --> 01:57:23.199 align:start position:0%
earth is familiar with it will affect
 
01:57:25.430 --> 01:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
probably about
 
01:57:27.270 --> 01:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
i would say at least 50 different class
 
01:57:29.189 --> 01:57:29.199 align:start position:0%
lines because it'll be
 
01:57:32.070 --> 01:57:32.080 align:start position:0%
the salaries and wages of employees who
 
01:57:33.030 --> 01:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
earn 4e
 
01:57:35.910 --> 01:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
as well as direct contracts with 4e uh
 
01:57:35.920 --> 01:57:37.189 align:start position:0%
as well as direct contracts with 4e uh
so

01:57:37.189 --> 01:57:37.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:57:40.390 --> 01:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
that um is our recommendation that you
 
01:57:42.149 --> 01:57:42.159 align:start position:0%
increase the lapse anywhere from
 
01:57:44.550 --> 01:57:44.560 align:start position:0%
two to four million dollars uh to
 
01:57:46.550 --> 01:57:46.560 align:start position:0%
represent this i don't believe that the
 
01:57:48.390 --> 01:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
governor's office did end up increasing
 
01:57:49.430 --> 01:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
the lapse
 
01:57:54.070 --> 01:57:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:57.910 --> 01:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
any questions on that one any questions
 
01:58:01.430 --> 01:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
representative for example
 
01:58:04.229 --> 01:58:04.239 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr jim so just to clarify
 
01:58:04.870 --> 01:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
that last
 
01:58:08.629 --> 01:58:08.639 align:start position:0%
comment the the
 
01:58:10.709 --> 01:58:10.719 align:start position:0%
who to four million dollars per year is
 
01:58:11.990 --> 01:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
the savings
 
01:58:15.910 --> 01:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
yes the cost is between
 
01:58:17.109 --> 01:58:17.119 align:start position:0%
is about half million dollars is that
 
01:58:19.109 --> 01:58:19.119 align:start position:0%
what i would read the uh
 
01:58:20.550 --> 01:58:20.560 align:start position:0%
it's actually about fifty thousand
 
01:58:23.510 --> 01:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
dollars okay
 
01:58:26.550 --> 01:58:26.560 align:start position:0%
so you're suggesting decrease in the
 
01:58:27.750 --> 01:58:27.760 align:start position:0%
lapse that's sort of
 
01:58:30.470 --> 01:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
recorded in the budget by the fifty
 
01:58:32.149 --> 01:58:32.159 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
01:58:34.390 --> 01:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
uh no i would suggest appropriating the
 
01:58:35.750 --> 01:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollars and
 
01:58:38.870 --> 01:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
increasing the labs by two to four
 
01:58:39.990 --> 01:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
01:58:43.669 --> 01:58:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:45.510 --> 01:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
i would say less than the first year
 
01:58:48.870 --> 01:58:48.880 align:start position:0%
more in the second year
 
01:58:51.510 --> 01:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
okay increase the lapse so that's to
 
01:58:52.790 --> 01:58:52.800 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
01:58:54.070 --> 01:58:54.080 align:start position:0%
count for the savings you're
 
01:58:55.830 --> 01:58:55.840 align:start position:0%
anticipating is that the idea
 
01:58:58.310 --> 01:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
correct okay correct the department will
 
01:59:00.629 --> 01:59:00.639 align:start position:0%
likely lapse more general funds
 
01:59:02.310 --> 01:59:02.320 align:start position:0%
because we've budgeted more general
 
01:59:04.070 --> 01:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
funds than hopefully we will need when
 
01:59:05.430 --> 01:59:05.440 align:start position:0%
we start earning this
 
01:59:08.149 --> 01:59:08.159 align:start position:0%
extra federal revenue okay thank you
 
01:59:09.669 --> 01:59:09.679 align:start position:0%
very much
 
01:59:11.669 --> 01:59:11.679 align:start position:0%
so ms rounds i'm looking at the column
 
01:59:14.950 --> 01:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
headings and i'm just having a hard time
 
01:59:19.589 --> 01:59:19.599 align:start position:0%
tracking the projected annual savings
 
01:59:22.550 --> 01:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
is that in a column no savings are not
 
01:59:23.750 --> 01:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
represented on this
 
01:59:26.149 --> 01:59:26.159 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet but they would be within
 
01:59:29.750 --> 01:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
these individual reports
 
01:59:32.310 --> 01:59:32.320 align:start position:0%
on each of the findings the potential
 
01:59:35.030 --> 01:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
savings are listed
 
01:59:39.030 --> 01:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
okay so so just just sort of
 
01:59:42.229 --> 01:59:42.239 align:start position:0%
let you know how busy people think
 
01:59:44.390 --> 01:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
that have to make decisions it's nice to
 
01:59:44.400 --> 01:59:45.510 align:start position:0%
that have to make decisions it's nice to
see

01:59:45.510 --> 01:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
see
 
01:59:50.229 --> 01:59:50.239 align:start position:0%
the investments offset by the
 
01:59:52.390 --> 01:59:52.400 align:start position:0%
savings and the return so that we can
 
01:59:54.149 --> 01:59:54.159 align:start position:0%
see what the
 
01:59:56.950 --> 01:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
what the cost benefit analysis is on
 
01:59:59.189 --> 01:59:59.199 align:start position:0%
kind of all on one sheet
 
02:00:01.990 --> 02:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
so sure i can update this spreadsheet if
 
02:00:02.709 --> 02:00:02.719 align:start position:0%
you would like
 
02:00:04.709 --> 02:00:04.719 align:start position:0%
no i no i think that's fine i'm just
 
02:00:06.790 --> 02:00:06.800 align:start position:0%
talking about for future
 
02:00:08.629 --> 02:00:08.639 align:start position:0%
purposes it would have been it would be
 
02:00:10.310 --> 02:00:10.320 align:start position:0%
nice for for me
 
02:00:13.030 --> 02:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
to see a cost-benefit analysis per
 
02:00:13.040 --> 02:00:14.470 align:start position:0%
to see a cost-benefit analysis per
project

02:00:14.470 --> 02:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
project
 
02:00:17.350 --> 02:00:17.360 align:start position:0%
all on one sheet but this is i can work
 
02:00:18.629 --> 02:00:18.639 align:start position:0%
with this go ahead
 
02:00:20.950 --> 02:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
understood thank you so if there are no
 
02:00:22.629 --> 02:00:22.639 align:start position:0%
other questions on that one i
 
02:00:24.470 --> 02:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
would turn it over to i believe matt
 
02:00:28.950 --> 02:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:31.270 --> 02:00:31.280 align:start position:0%
everyone this is actually tyler stone
 
02:00:31.280 --> 02:00:33.589 align:start position:0%
everyone this is actually tyler stone
sorry

02:00:33.589 --> 02:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
02:00:36.229 --> 02:00:36.239 align:start position:0%
uh hi uh thank you karen thank you mr
 
02:00:37.910 --> 02:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
chairman and members of the committee
 
02:00:39.589 --> 02:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
can everybody hear me okay
 
02:00:42.790 --> 02:00:42.800 align:start position:0%
great excellent i'll be addressing
 
02:00:45.350 --> 02:00:45.360 align:start position:0%
the line items here that relate to
 
02:00:47.830 --> 02:00:47.840 align:start position:0%
critical time intervention or cti
 
02:00:51.510 --> 02:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
as well as cmhc funding there are
 
02:00:54.390 --> 02:00:54.400 align:start position:0%
three primary benefits to implementing
 
02:00:54.400 --> 02:00:55.430 align:start position:0%
three primary benefits to implementing
cti

02:00:55.430 --> 02:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
cti
 
02:00:58.470 --> 02:00:58.480 align:start position:0%
the first is its positive impact on
 
02:01:00.149 --> 02:01:00.159 align:start position:0%
the health outcomes of new hampshire
 
02:01:03.109 --> 02:01:03.119 align:start position:0%
citizens cti increases the likelihood
 
02:01:04.470 --> 02:01:04.480 align:start position:0%
that people transitioning
 
02:01:07.030 --> 02:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
out of psychiatric hospitals will
 
02:01:09.030 --> 02:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
reintegrate successfully back
 
02:01:11.510 --> 02:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
into their communities thereby avoiding
 
02:01:13.589 --> 02:01:13.599 align:start position:0%
a relapse that may put them
 
02:01:15.990 --> 02:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
back into the hospital extensive
 
02:01:17.109 --> 02:01:17.119 align:start position:0%
academic research
 
02:01:19.430 --> 02:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
supports this randomized controlled
 
02:01:21.350 --> 02:01:21.360 align:start position:0%
trials the most rigorous form
 
02:01:23.430 --> 02:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
of research have found that cti can
 
02:01:25.350 --> 02:01:25.360 align:start position:0%
reduce hospital readmissions
 
02:01:28.550 --> 02:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
by as much as 26 the program
 
02:01:31.430 --> 02:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
helps people leaving hospitals identify
 
02:01:32.070 --> 02:01:32.080 align:start position:0%
and secure
 
02:01:34.390 --> 02:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
the critical things they need to live
 
02:01:34.400 --> 02:01:35.669 align:start position:0%
the critical things they need to live
independently

02:01:35.669 --> 02:01:35.679 align:start position:0%
independently
 
02:01:39.430 --> 02:01:39.440 align:start position:0%
a job housing food supply
 
02:01:42.149 --> 02:01:42.159 align:start position:0%
relationships with family and peers as
 
02:01:43.109 --> 02:01:43.119 align:start position:0%
well as the mental
 
02:01:45.990 --> 02:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
and physical health care they may need
 
02:01:47.830 --> 02:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
every person's cti helps
 
02:01:50.470 --> 02:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
reintegrate into their community and not
 
02:01:52.470 --> 02:01:52.480 align:start position:0%
be readmitted to a hospital
 
02:01:54.470 --> 02:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
is someone once again able to be a
 
02:01:55.750 --> 02:01:55.760 align:start position:0%
contributing member
 
02:01:59.510 --> 02:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
of society the second benefit
 
02:02:02.470 --> 02:02:02.480 align:start position:0%
is cost savings to the state the average
 
02:02:04.229 --> 02:02:04.239 align:start position:0%
cost of an admission to new hampshire
 
02:02:04.239 --> 02:02:04.790 align:start position:0%
cost of an admission to new hampshire
hospital

02:02:04.790 --> 02:02:04.800 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
02:02:07.669 --> 02:02:07.679 align:start position:0%
for someone under 65 is approximately
 
02:02:07.679 --> 02:02:08.709 align:start position:0%
for someone under 65 is approximately
1500

02:02:08.709 --> 02:02:08.719 align:start position:0%
1500
 
02:02:11.830 --> 02:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
per person per day many individuals can
 
02:02:13.669 --> 02:02:13.679 align:start position:0%
stay at the hospital for weeks
 
02:02:16.390 --> 02:02:16.400 align:start position:0%
or even months and as a result the cost
 
02:02:18.709 --> 02:02:18.719 align:start position:0%
can quickly add up
 
02:02:21.910 --> 02:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
cti in contrast is far less expensive
 
02:02:23.589 --> 02:02:23.599 align:start position:0%
averaging around four thousand dollars
 
02:02:24.629 --> 02:02:24.639 align:start position:0%
per person
 
02:02:27.910 --> 02:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
per year thus while there is a recurring
 
02:02:30.550 --> 02:02:30.560 align:start position:0%
annual cost to pay for cti providers
 
02:02:32.870 --> 02:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
that is to say the programs and the
 
02:02:34.470 --> 02:02:34.480 align:start position:0%
workers around the state that would
 
02:02:36.870 --> 02:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
actually deliver cti services
 
02:02:38.950 --> 02:02:38.960 align:start position:0%
there is also recurring annual cost
 
02:02:38.960 --> 02:02:40.470 align:start position:0%
there is also recurring annual cost
avoidance

02:02:40.470 --> 02:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
avoidance
 
02:02:42.550 --> 02:02:42.560 align:start position:0%
we anticipate that every million dollars
 
02:02:44.470 --> 02:02:44.480 align:start position:0%
spent by the state on cti
 
02:02:46.870 --> 02:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
could save 1.3 million in avoidable
 
02:02:48.950 --> 02:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
inpatient hospital costs
 
02:02:52.149 --> 02:02:52.159 align:start position:0%
i i need to i need to ask you to be
 
02:02:54.870 --> 02:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
patient with me for a second i i got a a
 
02:02:57.109 --> 02:02:57.119 align:start position:0%
couple of questions to help reorient me
 
02:02:58.229 --> 02:02:58.239 align:start position:0%
to what you're
 
02:03:01.510 --> 02:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
you're speaking on of course the first
 
02:03:05.109 --> 02:03:05.119 align:start position:0%
is the macro view uh or is does this
 
02:03:09.589 --> 02:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
sequence on this matrix imply
 
02:03:12.470 --> 02:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh recommendation priorities like you
 
02:03:14.070 --> 02:03:14.080 align:start position:0%
would definitely do number one
 
02:03:16.149 --> 02:03:16.159 align:start position:0%
then you would definitely do number two
 
02:03:18.470 --> 02:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
and if there's one that's on the cusp it
 
02:03:20.950 --> 02:03:20.960 align:start position:0%
could possibly be dd redesigned
 
02:03:23.350 --> 02:03:23.360 align:start position:0%
is that is this meant to imply priority
 
02:03:24.790 --> 02:03:24.800 align:start position:0%
it is not
 
02:03:26.709 --> 02:03:26.719 align:start position:0%
it is not i would say that these are all
 
02:03:30.020 --> 02:03:30.030 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:30.030 --> 02:03:31.830 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:03:31.830 --> 02:03:31.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:03:34.390 --> 02:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
i i just missed it i must have drifted
 
02:03:36.390 --> 02:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
off for a second there
 
02:03:38.790 --> 02:03:38.800 align:start position:0%
what is at its essence not not the
 
02:03:41.189 --> 02:03:41.199 align:start position:0%
paragraph or two but just at its essence
 
02:03:43.990 --> 02:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
what is a critical time intervention who
 
02:03:46.070 --> 02:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
is doing what with the patient
 
02:03:49.350 --> 02:03:49.360 align:start position:0%
to make it a critical time intervention
 
02:03:51.109 --> 02:03:51.119 align:start position:0%
it's an excellent question mr chairman
 
02:03:53.830 --> 02:03:53.840 align:start position:0%
critical time intervention is a program
 
02:03:56.950 --> 02:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
that lasts nine months and it is a
 
02:03:58.629 --> 02:03:58.639 align:start position:0%
individual or sometimes a team of
 
02:04:00.629 --> 02:04:00.639 align:start position:0%
individuals that assist
 
02:04:02.790 --> 02:04:02.800 align:start position:0%
people transitioning out of psychiatric
 
02:04:05.189 --> 02:04:05.199 align:start position:0%
hospitals so when they're discharged
 
02:04:07.189 --> 02:04:07.199 align:start position:0%
after having had an acute mental health
 
02:04:07.199 --> 02:04:08.310 align:start position:0%
after having had an acute mental health
episode

02:04:08.310 --> 02:04:08.320 align:start position:0%
episode
 
02:04:10.390 --> 02:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
it helps them leave the hospital and
 
02:04:12.310 --> 02:04:12.320 align:start position:0%
reintegrate into their community
 
02:04:14.069 --> 02:04:14.079 align:start position:0%
so that they have all the essential
 
02:04:16.390 --> 02:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
things of life to be independent
 
02:04:18.310 --> 02:04:18.320 align:start position:0%
back in that community on a sustainable
 
02:04:19.750 --> 02:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
footing meaning
 
02:04:23.430 --> 02:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
finding a job housing access to food
 
02:04:25.350 --> 02:04:25.360 align:start position:0%
and ensuring they have access to the
 
02:04:27.189 --> 02:04:27.199 align:start position:0%
mental health care or physical health
 
02:04:27.199 --> 02:04:27.750 align:start position:0%
mental health care or physical health
care

02:04:27.750 --> 02:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
care
 
02:04:30.149 --> 02:04:30.159 align:start position:0%
they may need to stay in the community
 
02:04:31.270 --> 02:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
the whole goal
 
02:04:34.229 --> 02:04:34.239 align:start position:0%
is to prevent readmission to a hospital
 
02:04:36.790 --> 02:04:36.800 align:start position:0%
which is oftentimes a less than ideal
 
02:04:38.790 --> 02:04:38.800 align:start position:0%
mental health outcome and is also
 
02:04:41.589 --> 02:04:41.599 align:start position:0%
oftentimes very expensive to the state
 
02:04:45.589 --> 02:04:45.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:48.790 --> 02:04:48.800 align:start position:0%
intense care coordination lasting nine
 
02:04:50.709 --> 02:04:50.719 align:start position:0%
months after discharge
 
02:04:52.550 --> 02:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
to make sure that all the social
 
02:04:54.149 --> 02:04:54.159 align:start position:0%
determinants of health
 
02:04:57.350 --> 02:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
are satisfied for that patient
 
02:04:58.790 --> 02:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
i i think that is a fair
 
02:05:00.709 --> 02:05:00.719 align:start position:0%
characterization uh especially the
 
02:05:02.629 --> 02:05:02.639 align:start position:0%
emphasis on the social determinants of
 
02:05:02.639 --> 02:05:03.430 align:start position:0%
emphasis on the social determinants of
health

02:05:03.430 --> 02:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
health
 
02:05:06.550 --> 02:05:06.560 align:start position:0%
at the end yeah and so so
 
02:05:08.470 --> 02:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
for example if there's housing and
 
02:05:10.950 --> 02:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
security or food insecurity
 
02:05:13.589 --> 02:05:13.599 align:start position:0%
uh is does that care coordination
 
02:05:13.599 --> 02:05:15.030 align:start position:0%
uh is does that care coordination
include

02:05:15.030 --> 02:05:15.040 align:start position:0%
include
 
02:05:18.709 --> 02:05:18.719 align:start position:0%
finding vouchers or other programs to
 
02:05:21.510 --> 02:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
support that individual that is
 
02:05:23.430 --> 02:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
certainly possible yes sir
 
02:05:26.069 --> 02:05:26.079 align:start position:0%
possible but not present at the current
 
02:05:26.079 --> 02:05:27.510 align:start position:0%
possible but not present at the current
time

02:05:27.510 --> 02:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:05:29.430 --> 02:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
no what i mean by that mr chairman is it
 
02:05:30.870 --> 02:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
will vary based on
 
02:05:32.390 --> 02:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
on the individual if they need
 
02:05:34.470 --> 02:05:34.480 align:start position:0%
assistance finding vouchers
 
02:05:36.550 --> 02:05:36.560 align:start position:0%
for example then the cti worker could
 
02:05:39.270 --> 02:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
help them find those vouchers
 
02:05:41.589 --> 02:05:41.599 align:start position:0%
all right i'm sorry i interrupted you
 
02:05:45.350 --> 02:05:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:47.109 --> 02:05:47.119 align:start position:0%
absolutely and and police interruptions
 
02:05:49.750 --> 02:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
are welcome
 
02:05:52.470 --> 02:05:52.480 align:start position:0%
the third and final benefit of cti uh is
 
02:05:54.470 --> 02:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
that it will help reduce the number of
 
02:05:54.480 --> 02:05:55.669 align:start position:0%
that it will help reduce the number of
individuals

02:05:55.669 --> 02:05:55.679 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
02:05:58.310 --> 02:05:58.320 align:start position:0%
on hospital wait lists by creating a
 
02:06:00.310 --> 02:06:00.320 align:start position:0%
more efficient model of care at
 
02:06:02.950 --> 02:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
hospitals the need for such weightless
 
02:06:02.960 --> 02:06:03.910 align:start position:0%
hospitals the need for such weightless
reductions

02:06:03.910 --> 02:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
reductions
 
02:06:06.470 --> 02:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
i think we all know is is considerable
 
02:06:08.390 --> 02:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
it's greater now in fact
 
02:06:11.430 --> 02:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
than it has been really since dhhs began
 
02:06:13.510 --> 02:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
tracking data in 2015.
 
02:06:15.830 --> 02:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
um fewer individuals admitted to
 
02:06:15.840 --> 02:06:16.629 align:start position:0%
um fewer individuals admitted to
hospitals

02:06:16.629 --> 02:06:16.639 align:start position:0%
hospitals
 
02:06:19.189 --> 02:06:19.199 align:start position:0%
or readmitted i should say and instead
 
02:06:21.109 --> 02:06:21.119 align:start position:0%
reintegrated into their community
 
02:06:23.030 --> 02:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
means less pressure on the hospital
 
02:06:25.510 --> 02:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
system allowing hospitals to admit and
 
02:06:27.189 --> 02:06:27.199 align:start position:0%
process individuals
 
02:06:30.709 --> 02:06:30.719 align:start position:0%
faster and more effectively
 
02:06:34.709 --> 02:06:34.719 align:start position:0%
so so i fully accept
 
02:06:37.990 --> 02:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
um i guess i
 
02:06:39.750 --> 02:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
i guess where i'm going is on the
 
02:06:41.510 --> 02:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
savings i want to know more about the
 
02:06:43.109 --> 02:06:43.119 align:start position:0%
savings and that's not what you're
 
02:06:44.790 --> 02:06:44.800 align:start position:0%
talking about right now
 
02:06:47.270 --> 02:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
but i i understand the theory of how
 
02:06:48.310 --> 02:06:48.320 align:start position:0%
there's going to be
 
02:06:50.709 --> 02:06:50.719 align:start position:0%
cost savings that that's that's going to
 
02:06:51.990 --> 02:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
accrue to the state
 
02:06:54.069 --> 02:06:54.079 align:start position:0%
and i accept that this is good clinical
 
02:06:56.310 --> 02:06:56.320 align:start position:0%
care in theory i got i'm not
 
02:06:59.030 --> 02:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
debating the program i'm just doing the
 
02:06:59.040 --> 02:07:00.310 align:start position:0%
debating the program i'm just doing the
finances

02:07:00.310 --> 02:07:00.320 align:start position:0%
finances
 
02:07:04.550 --> 02:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
and and on the savings to what extent
 
02:07:07.830 --> 02:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
do you have proof or evidence
 
02:07:11.990 --> 02:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
or that the savings will materialize
 
02:07:15.910 --> 02:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
as opposed to a kind of a managerial
 
02:07:15.920 --> 02:07:16.390 align:start position:0%
as opposed to a kind of a managerial
cost

02:07:16.390 --> 02:07:16.400 align:start position:0%
cost
 
02:07:19.669 --> 02:07:19.679 align:start position:0%
estimate of theory
 
02:07:22.790 --> 02:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
our report mr chairman goes into this in
 
02:07:25.589 --> 02:07:25.599 align:start position:0%
in much greater detail i would obviously
 
02:07:26.950 --> 02:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
encourage you i'm just sticking my
 
02:07:28.870 --> 02:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
finger into this one to get some sense
 
02:07:28.880 --> 02:07:29.109 align:start position:0%
finger into this one to get some sense
of

02:07:29.109 --> 02:07:29.119 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:07:32.229 --> 02:07:32.239 align:start position:0%
how how how deep this is of course
 
02:07:34.709 --> 02:07:34.719 align:start position:0%
um i i do think the report will answer
 
02:07:36.470 --> 02:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
that question in great detail
 
02:07:38.390 --> 02:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
i would say just in the moment here
 
02:07:38.400 --> 02:07:39.510 align:start position:0%
i would say just in the moment here
briefly

02:07:39.510 --> 02:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
briefly
 
02:07:42.069 --> 02:07:42.079 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of academic research that
 
02:07:43.669 --> 02:07:43.679 align:start position:0%
supports the idea
 
02:07:46.629 --> 02:07:46.639 align:start position:0%
that cti can reduce readmissions to
 
02:07:48.149 --> 02:07:48.159 align:start position:0%
hospitals including some of the most
 
02:07:49.830 --> 02:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
rigorous type of research
 
02:07:52.390 --> 02:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
rcts or randomized control trials our
 
02:07:54.390 --> 02:07:54.400 align:start position:0%
analysis was predicated on
 
02:07:57.030 --> 02:07:57.040 align:start position:0%
using that evidence which is extensive
 
02:07:58.870 --> 02:07:58.880 align:start position:0%
to model what the reductions would look
 
02:07:58.880 --> 02:07:59.270 align:start position:0%
to model what the reductions would look
like

02:07:59.270 --> 02:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
like
 
02:08:01.350 --> 02:08:01.360 align:start position:0%
at new hampshire hospital and what the
 
02:08:03.669 --> 02:08:03.679 align:start position:0%
attendant reduction and cost would be
 
02:08:06.790 --> 02:08:06.800 align:start position:0%
assuming a reduction in readmissions
 
02:08:09.589 --> 02:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
outstanding answer representative walner
 
02:08:10.629 --> 02:08:10.639 align:start position:0%
did you have a question
 
02:08:11.830 --> 02:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
it looked like you were reaching for
 
02:08:15.109 --> 02:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:18.470 --> 02:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
no okay uh you can continue
 
02:08:22.069 --> 02:08:22.079 align:start position:0%
uh mr stone thank you sir
 
02:08:24.229 --> 02:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
the last item i would comment on uh in
 
02:08:27.669 --> 02:08:27.679 align:start position:0%
the document here is on cmhc funding
 
02:08:29.589 --> 02:08:29.599 align:start position:0%
the primary benefit of adjusting how
 
02:08:30.870 --> 02:08:30.880 align:start position:0%
cmhcs or
 
02:08:32.629 --> 02:08:32.639 align:start position:0%
community mental health centers of which
 
02:08:34.709 --> 02:08:34.719 align:start position:0%
there are 10 around new hampshire
 
02:08:36.550 --> 02:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
the primary benefit of adjusting how
 
02:08:37.910 --> 02:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
they're funded is
 
02:08:40.790 --> 02:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
cost savings to the state cm agencies
 
02:08:41.910 --> 02:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
play a vital role
 
02:08:44.229 --> 02:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
in the state's continuum of care they
 
02:08:46.390 --> 02:08:46.400 align:start position:0%
offer a range of mental health services
 
02:08:48.550 --> 02:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
to the citizens of new hampshire
 
02:08:51.270 --> 02:08:51.280 align:start position:0%
one such service is assertive community
 
02:08:51.280 --> 02:08:51.990 align:start position:0%
one such service is assertive community
treatment

02:08:51.990 --> 02:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
02:08:54.069 --> 02:08:54.079 align:start position:0%
or act which provides treatment for
 
02:08:56.149 --> 02:08:56.159 align:start position:0%
individuals with serious mental illness
 
02:08:58.550 --> 02:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
in their community rather than in a
 
02:08:59.910 --> 02:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
hospital setting
 
02:09:01.589 --> 02:09:01.599 align:start position:0%
the state currently funds this
 
02:09:03.910 --> 02:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
particular service in the form of annual
 
02:09:03.920 --> 02:09:05.030 align:start position:0%
particular service in the form of annual
contracts

02:09:05.030 --> 02:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
contracts
 
02:09:08.069 --> 02:09:08.079 align:start position:0%
for each of the 10 cmhcs
 
02:09:10.870 --> 02:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
moving much of this cost to medicaid as
 
02:09:12.550 --> 02:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
we propose in a report
 
02:09:14.790 --> 02:09:14.800 align:start position:0%
in the form of a bundled rate for these
 
02:09:15.990 --> 02:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
act services
 
02:09:18.390 --> 02:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
could save the state up to 1.7 million
 
02:09:20.149 --> 02:09:20.159 align:start position:0%
dollars per year
 
02:09:22.149 --> 02:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
the department has the resources to
 
02:09:23.990 --> 02:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
develop this bundled rate
 
02:09:25.990 --> 02:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
and submit the appropriate documentation
 
02:09:28.790 --> 02:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
to the to cms the centers for medicaid
 
02:09:30.149 --> 02:09:30.159 align:start position:0%
and medicare services
 
02:09:33.030 --> 02:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
for approval the associated one-time
 
02:09:33.750 --> 02:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
cost here
 
02:09:36.069 --> 02:09:36.079 align:start position:0%
is the anticipated cost of a third-party
 
02:09:37.270 --> 02:09:37.280 align:start position:0%
accounting firm
 
02:09:39.589 --> 02:09:39.599 align:start position:0%
to review the rate before its submission
 
02:09:41.830 --> 02:09:41.840 align:start position:0%
which is a a very standard practice
 
02:09:44.830 --> 02:09:44.840 align:start position:0%
when setting rates of this kind
 
02:09:46.310 --> 02:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
representative has her hand up will you
 
02:09:48.629 --> 02:09:48.639 align:start position:0%
take a question
 
02:09:53.189 --> 02:09:53.199 align:start position:0%
certainly so i guess a question i have
 
02:09:57.189 --> 02:09:57.199 align:start position:0%
on all on all of the items here um
 
02:10:00.950 --> 02:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
i think it's they're really interesting
 
02:10:04.229 --> 02:10:04.239 align:start position:0%
items and i guess my question is
 
02:10:07.750 --> 02:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
how much discussion has there been with
 
02:10:10.709 --> 02:10:10.719 align:start position:0%
the providers of these services i'm i'm
 
02:10:11.830 --> 02:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
asking it here
 
02:10:14.069 --> 02:10:14.079 align:start position:0%
but i've also i'm also particularly
 
02:10:14.079 --> 02:10:15.030 align:start position:0%
but i've also i'm also particularly
interested

02:10:15.030 --> 02:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
interested
 
02:10:18.229 --> 02:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
in the dd system how much
 
02:10:21.270 --> 02:10:21.280 align:start position:0%
participation have they had in taking a
 
02:10:25.030 --> 02:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:27.830 --> 02:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
on the subject of provider engagement
 
02:10:30.550 --> 02:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
for cti and cmhc i would have to defer
 
02:10:31.589 --> 02:10:31.599 align:start position:0%
to the department
 
02:10:33.350 --> 02:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
representative and i would have to defer
 
02:10:38.790 --> 02:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:41.430 --> 02:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
thank you can we get that input at some
 
02:10:43.669 --> 02:10:43.679 align:start position:0%
point uh chairman
 
02:10:47.109 --> 02:10:47.119 align:start position:0%
oh sure i'm just um i was just about to
 
02:10:48.470 --> 02:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
ask mrs rounds if
 
02:10:50.550 --> 02:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
she thinks there's somebody in the
 
02:10:52.390 --> 02:10:52.400 align:start position:0%
participant list that might be able to
 
02:10:53.910 --> 02:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
address that
 
02:10:57.350 --> 02:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
i was looking to see if katya was
 
02:11:00.870 --> 02:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
there she is i don't um
 
02:11:02.390 --> 02:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
katya if you're available can you raise
 
02:11:04.709 --> 02:11:04.719 align:start position:0%
your hand sometimes sometimes staff are
 
02:11:06.790 --> 02:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
listening but doing other things so they
 
02:11:09.430 --> 02:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
they may not be available i don't
 
02:11:10.069 --> 02:11:10.079 align:start position:0%
believe it
 
02:11:13.669 --> 02:11:13.679 align:start position:0%
i believe they listen to every word i do
 
02:11:30.629 --> 02:11:30.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:32.390 --> 02:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
did you um hear the question of there
 
02:11:34.629 --> 02:11:34.639 align:start position:0%
you are i did i did sorry i just had to
 
02:11:34.639 --> 02:11:35.030 align:start position:0%
you are i did i did sorry i just had to
go

02:11:35.030 --> 02:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
go
 
02:11:38.069 --> 02:11:38.079 align:start position:0%
shut the door in um henry lippmann's
 
02:11:39.030 --> 02:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
face because
 
02:11:41.430 --> 02:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
um i wanted to get the noise reduced if
 
02:11:42.870 --> 02:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
i have
 
02:11:46.229 --> 02:11:46.239 align:start position:0%
that was my mad rush to the door um
 
02:11:49.990 --> 02:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
so the question could you repeat
 
02:11:54.229 --> 02:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
um representative um walner
 
02:11:56.310 --> 02:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
i just want to know i'm just wondering
 
02:11:57.830 --> 02:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
on all of these items
 
02:11:59.990 --> 02:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
um there's a obviously on all of these
 
02:12:00.950 --> 02:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
items there
 
02:12:02.870 --> 02:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
there are providers who provide the
 
02:12:02.880 --> 02:12:04.149 align:start position:0%
there are providers who provide the
services

02:12:04.149 --> 02:12:04.159 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:12:06.149 --> 02:12:06.159 align:start position:0%
how much engagement have you had with
 
02:12:08.069 --> 02:12:08.079 align:start position:0%
the providers have they
 
02:12:11.430 --> 02:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
had input um do you plan i mean
 
02:12:13.109 --> 02:12:13.119 align:start position:0%
what what are the plans for getting
 
02:12:15.510 --> 02:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
input from providers around this
 
02:12:18.790 --> 02:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
that's that's a great question so um
 
02:12:22.310 --> 02:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
in particular cti is a program that is
 
02:12:24.310 --> 02:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
known to new hampshire
 
02:12:27.830 --> 02:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
through our integrated delivery networks
 
02:12:29.750 --> 02:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
through the medicaid transformation
 
02:12:31.910 --> 02:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
waivers so that has been something that
 
02:12:33.270 --> 02:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
has been
 
02:12:35.990 --> 02:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
worked on by the community in your
 
02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:37.830 align:start position:0%
worked on by the community in your
communities

02:12:37.830 --> 02:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
communities
 
02:12:42.310 --> 02:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
and we so that informed
 
02:12:46.229 --> 02:12:46.239 align:start position:0%
as part and you can see in the report
 
02:12:49.430 --> 02:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
who was consulted but that helped inform
 
02:12:52.550 --> 02:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
the um proposal we
 
02:12:55.910 --> 02:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
anticipate so we also have
 
02:12:58.229 --> 02:12:58.239 align:start position:0%
spent a lot of time talking about how do
 
02:12:59.750 --> 02:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
we sustain
 
02:13:03.030 --> 02:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
the funding and the
 
02:13:06.310 --> 02:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
programs that are associated with act
 
02:13:08.629 --> 02:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
and with other community mental health
 
02:13:09.990 --> 02:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
center programming
 
02:13:13.669 --> 02:13:13.679 align:start position:0%
and not rely so heavily on general funds
 
02:13:16.390 --> 02:13:16.400 align:start position:0%
and we've had those discussions um
 
02:13:19.589 --> 02:13:19.599 align:start position:0%
off and on throughout the years
 
02:13:22.470 --> 02:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
make no mistake that this includes a
 
02:13:22.480 --> 02:13:23.430 align:start position:0%
make no mistake that this includes a
stakeholder

02:13:23.430 --> 02:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
stakeholder
 
02:13:26.390 --> 02:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
process that is going to be robust and
 
02:13:28.950 --> 02:13:28.960 align:start position:0%
so we're just getting our
 
02:13:32.550 --> 02:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
internal teams together but we
 
02:13:35.910 --> 02:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
anticipate a formal engagement plan
 
02:13:38.629 --> 02:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
and for example we had a meeting with
 
02:13:40.310 --> 02:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
the community mental health centers on
 
02:13:40.320 --> 02:13:41.510 align:start position:0%
the community mental health centers on
wednesday

02:13:41.510 --> 02:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
wednesday
 
02:13:44.390 --> 02:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
so i briefed them on the report made
 
02:13:46.470 --> 02:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
sure that they had it and had seen it
 
02:13:49.830 --> 02:13:49.840 align:start position:0%
and fielded questions we did the same
 
02:13:51.430 --> 02:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
thing with the integrated delivery
 
02:13:51.440 --> 02:13:52.390 align:start position:0%
thing with the integrated delivery
network

02:13:52.390 --> 02:13:52.400 align:start position:0%
network
 
02:13:55.589 --> 02:13:55.599 align:start position:0%
uh leads team leads this morning
 
02:13:57.430 --> 02:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
um so we're going to continue to have
 
02:13:59.109 --> 02:13:59.119 align:start position:0%
the informal
 
02:14:01.270 --> 02:14:01.280 align:start position:0%
you know make sure you saw the report
 
02:14:02.870 --> 02:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
and you read through
 
02:14:04.790 --> 02:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
and then we're going to be formalizing a
 
02:14:06.390 --> 02:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
stakeholder process
 
02:14:12.069 --> 02:14:12.079 align:start position:0%
working with a m and members of the team
 
02:14:14.229 --> 02:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
does that that also includes the dd
 
02:14:17.510 --> 02:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
community as well right
 
02:14:19.270 --> 02:14:19.280 align:start position:0%
i would be speaking out of turn if i
 
02:14:20.629 --> 02:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
were to speak on behalf
 
02:14:23.030 --> 02:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
of that particular line of work but i
 
02:14:25.189 --> 02:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
believe that that's front and center
 
02:14:28.149 --> 02:14:28.159 align:start position:0%
in the report as i read it um that there
 
02:14:29.270 --> 02:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
there has to be
 
02:14:31.990 --> 02:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
i mean that we can't do these major
 
02:14:33.990 --> 02:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
significant changes without stakeholder
 
02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:35.109 align:start position:0%
significant changes without stakeholder
input

02:14:35.109 --> 02:14:35.119 align:start position:0%
input
 
02:14:38.470 --> 02:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
great thank you thank you when we get to
 
02:14:38.480 --> 02:14:38.790 align:start position:0%
great thank you thank you when we get to
the

02:14:38.790 --> 02:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:14:41.990 --> 02:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
dd item i'll um have kevin bring deb
 
02:14:45.030 --> 02:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
sheets over as well yeah great
 
02:14:46.790 --> 02:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
see that she just raised her hand so i
 
02:14:48.149 --> 02:14:48.159 align:start position:0%
have a question for you
 
02:14:51.030 --> 02:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
miss fox and i appreciate you coming in
 
02:14:52.709 --> 02:14:52.719 align:start position:0%
and answering questions
 
02:14:55.990 --> 02:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
i um okay so i just think i sometimes
 
02:14:58.470 --> 02:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
think in risk management terms
 
02:15:00.709 --> 02:15:00.719 align:start position:0%
and and and the way i'm looking at this
 
02:15:01.910 --> 02:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
is a potential
 
02:15:03.990 --> 02:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
risk that i i'd like you to comment on
 
02:15:05.750 --> 02:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
and maybe mr stone
 
02:15:09.350 --> 02:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
is is um you're asking
 
02:15:12.629 --> 02:15:12.639 align:start position:0%
for these for basically program launch
 
02:15:14.870 --> 02:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
authorization you want to go do these
 
02:15:17.109 --> 02:15:17.119 align:start position:0%
five programs and you want the money now
 
02:15:18.149 --> 02:15:18.159 align:start position:0%
to do it
 
02:15:20.870 --> 02:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
but i'm but i'm hearing in response to
 
02:15:22.790 --> 02:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
representative walner's
 
02:15:25.910 --> 02:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
question that
 
02:15:28.069 --> 02:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
we haven't completed sort of the
 
02:15:28.079 --> 02:15:29.270 align:start position:0%
we haven't completed sort of the
stakeholder

02:15:29.270 --> 02:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
stakeholder
 
02:15:32.390 --> 02:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
buy-in phase of the project and so i'm
 
02:15:32.400 --> 02:15:32.950 align:start position:0%
buy-in phase of the project and so i'm
just

02:15:32.950 --> 02:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:15:36.629 --> 02:15:36.639 align:start position:0%
concerned or i'm curious rather
 
02:15:40.149 --> 02:15:40.159 align:start position:0%
whether we might be launching
 
02:15:44.149 --> 02:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
projects that may not be
 
02:15:46.550 --> 02:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
exactly what the stakeholders are
 
02:15:47.589 --> 02:15:47.599 align:start position:0%
looking for
 
02:15:49.669 --> 02:15:49.679 align:start position:0%
could you could you speak to that risk
 
02:15:51.109 --> 02:15:51.119 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure
 
02:15:53.030 --> 02:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's nothing but i'd like to hear
 
02:15:53.040 --> 02:15:55.270 align:start position:0%
it's it's nothing but i'd like to hear
it

02:15:55.270 --> 02:15:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:57.830 --> 02:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
so i will only speak for the behavioral
 
02:15:58.870 --> 02:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
health projects
 
02:16:02.550 --> 02:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
and reiterate that cti is something that
 
02:16:04.069 --> 02:16:04.079 align:start position:0%
has been tested through the
 
02:16:07.030 --> 02:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
demonstration project through the idn's
 
02:16:10.149 --> 02:16:10.159 align:start position:0%
and that um we want to scale it up
 
02:16:12.550 --> 02:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
um and so there already has been buy-in
 
02:16:14.390 --> 02:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
at the community level
 
02:16:16.149 --> 02:16:16.159 align:start position:0%
and we want to scale it up and have it
 
02:16:18.229 --> 02:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
statewide so
 
02:16:21.589 --> 02:16:21.599 align:start position:0%
we have ambassadors for that who are
 
02:16:23.669 --> 02:16:23.679 align:start position:0%
already in the community and our
 
02:16:23.679 --> 02:16:25.350 align:start position:0%
already in the community and our
stakeholders

02:16:25.350 --> 02:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
stakeholders
 
02:16:27.350 --> 02:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
that's not to say that there won't be
 
02:16:29.430 --> 02:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
complications as we work through the
 
02:16:29.440 --> 02:16:30.950 align:start position:0%
complications as we work through the
details

02:16:30.950 --> 02:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
details
 
02:16:34.469 --> 02:16:34.479 align:start position:0%
but we're planning to work those through
 
02:16:38.070 --> 02:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
on the funding source funding is always
 
02:16:38.790 --> 02:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
an issue and
 
02:16:42.389 --> 02:16:42.399 align:start position:0%
always at risk and subject to
 
02:16:45.429 --> 02:16:45.439 align:start position:0%
available general funds so anytime
 
02:16:48.629 --> 02:16:48.639 align:start position:0%
we can double our money so to speak by
 
02:16:52.629 --> 02:16:52.639 align:start position:0%
um including medicaid including services
 
02:16:55.110 --> 02:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
and as a medicaid billable service
 
02:16:58.389 --> 02:16:58.399 align:start position:0%
um has been beneficial to the system
 
02:17:00.870 --> 02:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
so i'm not sure if karen wants to give a
 
02:17:02.230 --> 02:17:02.240 align:start position:0%
broader perspective
 
02:17:05.190 --> 02:17:05.200 align:start position:0%
um from the department but my question
 
02:17:07.190 --> 02:17:07.200 align:start position:0%
was really about the the risk we're
 
02:17:09.349 --> 02:17:09.359 align:start position:0%
going to accept if we begin
 
02:17:11.589 --> 02:17:11.599 align:start position:0%
implementation of these programs prior
 
02:17:11.599 --> 02:17:12.150 align:start position:0%
implementation of these programs prior
to

02:17:12.150 --> 02:17:12.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:17:15.349 --> 02:17:15.359 align:start position:0%
you know fuller stakeholder uh buy-in
 
02:17:16.790 --> 02:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
and i think you addressed that
 
02:17:19.830 --> 02:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
so thank you uh representative erf do
 
02:17:21.910 --> 02:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
you do you have a question sir
 
02:17:23.830 --> 02:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
just a quick question from mr stone he
 
02:17:25.190 --> 02:17:25.200 align:start position:0%
he said the cmhc
 
02:17:27.030 --> 02:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
was moving from something to medicaid i
 
02:17:28.230 --> 02:17:28.240 align:start position:0%
can't recall what the front something
 
02:17:28.240 --> 02:17:29.830 align:start position:0%
can't recall what the front something
was

02:17:29.830 --> 02:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:17:31.990 --> 02:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
so in the recommendation maybe tyler
 
02:17:33.589 --> 02:17:33.599 align:start position:0%
would speak to this directly
 
02:17:36.150 --> 02:17:36.160 align:start position:0%
but in the recommendation is to bundle
 
02:17:36.160 --> 02:17:37.509 align:start position:0%
but in the recommendation is to bundle
services

02:17:37.509 --> 02:17:37.519 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:17:39.750 --> 02:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
for example assertive community
 
02:17:40.790 --> 02:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
treatment is
 
02:17:43.910 --> 02:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
a program that is highly intense
 
02:17:47.349 --> 02:17:47.359 align:start position:0%
but it requires um a lot of work by the
 
02:17:48.549 --> 02:17:48.559 align:start position:0%
teams that are
 
02:17:50.389 --> 02:17:50.399 align:start position:0%
at each of the community mental health
 
02:17:52.549 --> 02:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
centers that
 
02:17:55.110 --> 02:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
are funds that are not reimbursable by
 
02:17:56.870 --> 02:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
medicaid right now so they're activities
 
02:17:58.709 --> 02:17:58.719 align:start position:0%
that aren't reimbursable
 
02:18:01.990 --> 02:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
so there's um so the idea is if you
 
02:18:03.990 --> 02:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
bundle a rate you can
 
02:18:07.589 --> 02:18:07.599 align:start position:0%
include those types of services
 
02:18:10.790 --> 02:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
um through medicaid as opposed to having
 
02:18:12.709 --> 02:18:12.719 align:start position:0%
to tap the general funds
 
02:18:16.790 --> 02:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
um for unreimbursable services
 
02:18:18.309 --> 02:18:18.319 align:start position:0%
what does it mean to bundle services so
 
02:18:19.990 --> 02:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
they become medicaid
 
02:18:23.030 --> 02:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh available so to speak
 
02:18:25.030 --> 02:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to look to a m to give a
 
02:18:27.110 --> 02:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
more um instead of the hack
 
02:18:29.190 --> 02:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
job that i would do um to give a a
 
02:18:31.830 --> 02:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
better response
 
02:18:34.870 --> 02:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
i i'd be i'd be happy to answer um
 
02:18:37.910 --> 02:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
in in in plain english uh act for
 
02:18:39.429 --> 02:18:39.439 align:start position:0%
example as a service
 
02:18:41.030 --> 02:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
there are actually many discrete
 
02:18:43.030 --> 02:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
services that it comprises and those are
 
02:18:44.230 --> 02:18:44.240 align:start position:0%
billed separately
 
02:18:46.070 --> 02:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
developing a bundled rate would mean
 
02:18:48.389 --> 02:18:48.399 align:start position:0%
there is one rate one payment for all of
 
02:18:51.030 --> 02:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
those services instead of many discrete
 
02:18:53.349 --> 02:18:53.359 align:start position:0%
services being paid for independently
 
02:18:54.070 --> 02:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
and to
 
02:18:55.910 --> 02:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
quickly just double back to your your
 
02:18:57.190 --> 02:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
previous question sir
 
02:19:00.389 --> 02:19:00.399 align:start position:0%
um the the idea is to move cost
 
02:19:02.150 --> 02:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
from what is currently being borne by
 
02:19:03.669 --> 02:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
the state to having it run through
 
02:19:05.190 --> 02:19:05.200 align:start position:0%
medicaid so that there are savings to
 
02:19:06.790 --> 02:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
the general fund in new hampshire
 
02:19:08.389 --> 02:19:08.399 align:start position:0%
i i totally understand the the idea and
 
02:19:09.910 --> 02:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
the concept i got that completely
 
02:19:12.150 --> 02:19:12.160 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to understand you know
 
02:19:14.469 --> 02:19:14.479 align:start position:0%
you're suggesting that by grouping these
 
02:19:16.230 --> 02:19:16.240 align:start position:0%
costs they become
 
02:19:18.309 --> 02:19:18.319 align:start position:0%
medicaid allowable whereas independently
 
02:19:20.549 --> 02:19:20.559 align:start position:0%
they are not
 
02:19:26.790 --> 02:19:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:29.030 --> 02:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
all right you can resume if you can
 
02:19:32.950 --> 02:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:35.030 --> 02:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh that is uh the extent of my of my
 
02:19:35.990 --> 02:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
commentary uh
 
02:19:37.349 --> 02:19:37.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chairman and
 
02:19:39.110 --> 02:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
members of the committee i'll i'll turn
 
02:19:40.070 --> 02:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
it back over to
 
02:19:42.549 --> 02:19:42.559 align:start position:0%
karen thank you for all your hard work
 
02:19:43.990 --> 02:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
on this you've probably been working on
 
02:19:45.750 --> 02:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
this for quite some time
 
02:19:49.910 --> 02:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:53.110 --> 02:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
so the next one that we have is the smi
 
02:19:55.830 --> 02:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
imd waiver and to answer representative
 
02:19:56.950 --> 02:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
walner's question
 
02:20:00.150 --> 02:20:00.160 align:start position:0%
uh the the primary stakeholder
 
02:20:03.270 --> 02:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
in this waiver as of right now anyway is
 
02:20:04.630 --> 02:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
new hampshire hospital
 
02:20:07.429 --> 02:20:07.439 align:start position:0%
and joe christie who is the cfo over at
 
02:20:08.630 --> 02:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
new hampshire hospital was
 
02:20:11.510 --> 02:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
was involved in this finding and looking
 
02:20:14.150 --> 02:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
at the data and the analysis as well
 
02:20:15.349 --> 02:20:15.359 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to go ahead and turn it
 
02:20:17.110 --> 02:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
over to a m to talk about the imdb
 
02:20:17.120 --> 02:20:20.070 align:start position:0%
over to a m to talk about the imdb
waiver

02:20:20.070 --> 02:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:22.630 --> 02:20:22.640 align:start position:0%
thank you karen and thank you chair
 
02:20:24.070 --> 02:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
02:20:25.990 --> 02:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
my name is jane again with uh
 
02:20:28.950 --> 02:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
alvarez and marcel so as division 3 has
 
02:20:30.550 --> 02:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
heard over the past couple weeks the
 
02:20:32.230 --> 02:20:32.240 align:start position:0%
emergency department waiting list
 
02:20:34.070 --> 02:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
is experiencing a resurgence after
 
02:20:35.590 --> 02:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
having been virtually eliminated in
 
02:20:37.270 --> 02:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
march of 2020
 
02:20:38.710 --> 02:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
and the chair noted in the hearing on
 
02:20:41.030 --> 02:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire hospital that at its core
 
02:20:44.309 --> 02:20:44.319 align:start position:0%
this is a problem of inputs and outputs
 
02:20:46.230 --> 02:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
programs like the philbrook adult
 
02:20:47.750 --> 02:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
transitional housing center are part of
 
02:20:49.110 --> 02:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
the solution
 
02:20:52.150 --> 02:20:52.160 align:start position:0%
an additional inpatient or imd capacity
 
02:20:54.790 --> 02:20:54.800 align:start position:0%
is also part of the solution the key
 
02:20:55.910 --> 02:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
here is to increase
 
02:20:58.230 --> 02:20:58.240 align:start position:0%
throughput across the system and get
 
02:21:00.550 --> 02:21:00.560 align:start position:0%
people in crisis the care they need
 
02:21:02.550 --> 02:21:02.560 align:start position:0%
when and where they need it so what i'd
 
02:21:04.150 --> 02:21:04.160 align:start position:0%
like to talk about this morning is a
 
02:21:05.910 --> 02:21:05.920 align:start position:0%
potential catalyst to increase
 
02:21:05.920 --> 02:21:06.790 align:start position:0%
potential catalyst to increase
throughput

02:21:06.790 --> 02:21:06.800 align:start position:0%
throughput
 
02:21:09.190 --> 02:21:09.200 align:start position:0%
which is to say expanding the state's
 
02:21:10.469 --> 02:21:10.479 align:start position:0%
imd waiver
 
02:21:12.230 --> 02:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
from the current focus on substance use
 
02:21:13.670 --> 02:21:13.680 align:start position:0%
disorder to include
 
02:21:16.790 --> 02:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
serious mental illness as well now why
 
02:21:18.550 --> 02:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
is a waiver required that may be a
 
02:21:19.910 --> 02:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
question running through your mind
 
02:21:21.270 --> 02:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
since the beginning of the medicaid
 
02:21:22.710 --> 02:21:22.720 align:start position:0%
program the federal government has
 
02:21:24.790 --> 02:21:24.800 align:start position:0%
prohibited medicaid reimbursement for
 
02:21:25.990 --> 02:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
inpatient behavioral
 
02:21:28.870 --> 02:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
care or care received in institutions
 
02:21:31.110 --> 02:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
for mental disease imds
 
02:21:33.030 --> 02:21:33.040 align:start position:0%
over time cms has loosened this
 
02:21:35.510 --> 02:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
restriction in the face of growing needs
 
02:21:37.349 --> 02:21:37.359 align:start position:0%
and pressure from interest groups most
 
02:21:39.030 --> 02:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
notably and recently
 
02:21:41.030 --> 02:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
by granting waivers of what is sometimes
 
02:21:43.270 --> 02:21:43.280 align:start position:0%
called the imd exclusion rule
 
02:21:45.429 --> 02:21:45.439 align:start position:0%
31 states have received waivers for
 
02:21:46.710 --> 02:21:46.720 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder
 
02:21:49.349 --> 02:21:49.359 align:start position:0%
sud including the state of new hampshire
 
02:21:51.110 --> 02:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
and most importantly for our discussion
 
02:21:51.120 --> 02:21:51.590 align:start position:0%
and most importantly for our discussion
today

02:21:51.590 --> 02:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:21:53.429 --> 02:21:53.439 align:start position:0%
seven states have received waivers for
 
02:21:55.030 --> 02:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
serious mental illness
 
02:21:56.950 --> 02:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
and one state's application for that
 
02:22:00.150 --> 02:22:00.160 align:start position:0%
waiver is still pending
 
02:22:02.150 --> 02:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
another logical question might be how
 
02:22:04.150 --> 02:22:04.160 align:start position:0%
have we gotten by without such a waiver
 
02:22:05.190 --> 02:22:05.200 align:start position:0%
so far
 
02:22:07.030 --> 02:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
while new hampshire hospital benefits in
 
02:22:08.790 --> 02:22:08.800 align:start position:0%
a major way from the disproportionate
 
02:22:10.389 --> 02:22:10.399 align:start position:0%
share hospital program
 
02:22:12.150 --> 02:22:12.160 align:start position:0%
which offsets the cost of care that
 
02:22:14.630 --> 02:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
would otherwise be uncompensated
 
02:22:16.550 --> 02:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
mr christie shared more information
 
02:22:17.910 --> 02:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
about this during the new hampshire here
 
02:22:19.270 --> 02:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
at new hampshire hospital hearing
 
02:22:20.950 --> 02:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
earlier this month
 
02:22:22.790 --> 02:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
now the only imd in new hampshire that
 
02:22:24.469 --> 02:22:24.479 align:start position:0%
benefits from this arrangement is new
 
02:22:25.750 --> 02:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital
 
02:22:27.429 --> 02:22:27.439 align:start position:0%
something which has limited the ability
 
02:22:29.030 --> 02:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
and interest from private sector
 
02:22:29.040 --> 02:22:29.990 align:start position:0%
and interest from private sector
partners

02:22:29.990 --> 02:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
partners
 
02:22:32.230 --> 02:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
in working with new hampshire to reduce
 
02:22:35.429 --> 02:22:35.439 align:start position:0%
the emergency department waiting list
 
02:22:36.950 --> 02:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
now what we're what we're trying to do
 
02:22:39.270 --> 02:22:39.280 align:start position:0%
with this imd waiver is to encourage a
 
02:22:41.429 --> 02:22:41.439 align:start position:0%
partner to develop a private imd that
 
02:22:42.150 --> 02:22:42.160 align:start position:0%
would expand
 
02:22:44.710 --> 02:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
inpatient services and perhaps even more
 
02:22:44.720 --> 02:22:45.510 align:start position:0%
inpatient services and perhaps even more
importantly

02:22:45.510 --> 02:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
importantly
 
02:22:47.750 --> 02:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
to offer needed community-based services
 
02:22:49.590 --> 02:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
such as mobile crisis teams
 
02:22:51.910 --> 02:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
or transitional housing just like the
 
02:22:54.550 --> 02:22:54.560 align:start position:0%
philbrook center again it's about inputs
 
02:22:57.510 --> 02:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
and outputs basically with medicaid
 
02:22:59.030 --> 02:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
being such an important payer for
 
02:23:00.790 --> 02:23:00.800 align:start position:0%
behavioral health services
 
02:23:02.630 --> 02:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
no private sector organization would
 
02:23:03.990 --> 02:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
want to risk the losses
 
02:23:05.990 --> 02:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
that would be incurred if medicaid
 
02:23:08.150 --> 02:23:08.160 align:start position:0%
cannot reimburse stays for people age
 
02:23:10.870 --> 02:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
22 to 64 which is currently the case
 
02:23:12.790 --> 02:23:12.800 align:start position:0%
under the exclusion
 
02:23:15.030 --> 02:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
one final crucial point to make what
 
02:23:17.750 --> 02:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
would be the cost of doing nothing
 
02:23:20.309 --> 02:23:20.319 align:start position:0%
reducing the waiting list is not just
 
02:23:21.590 --> 02:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
benevolent policy
 
02:23:23.270 --> 02:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
as important as it is to connect people
 
02:23:25.030 --> 02:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
in crisis with the care they need in a
 
02:23:26.150 --> 02:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
timely manner
 
02:23:27.830 --> 02:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
there are hard dollars that cost the
 
02:23:29.670 --> 02:23:29.680 align:start position:0%
state to maintain people
 
02:23:31.510 --> 02:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
in emergency departments while they're
 
02:23:33.110 --> 02:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
on the waiting list
 
02:23:35.429 --> 02:23:35.439 align:start position:0%
from the hearing on march 1st we heard
 
02:23:38.710 --> 02:23:38.720 align:start position:0%
that there were 1424 boarding days
 
02:23:42.070 --> 02:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
in the month of january 2021 on a run
 
02:23:44.070 --> 02:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
rate that equates to over 17
 
02:23:47.429 --> 02:23:47.439 align:start position:0%
000 boarding days per year now the per
 
02:23:48.630 --> 02:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
diem cost
 
02:23:50.150 --> 02:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
of boarding someone in the emergency
 
02:23:52.550 --> 02:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
department is estimated at two thousand
 
02:23:54.309 --> 02:23:54.319 align:start position:0%
two hundred and sixty four dollars
 
02:23:57.110 --> 02:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
per day per diem now that's cited from
 
02:23:58.309 --> 02:23:58.319 align:start position:0%
an emergency medicine
 
02:24:00.150 --> 02:24:00.160 align:start position:0%
academic journal that we reference on
 
02:24:02.469 --> 02:24:02.479 align:start position:0%
page 13 of our report
 
02:24:04.790 --> 02:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
large portions of that fall on the
 
02:24:05.830 --> 02:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
02:24:07.030 --> 02:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
whether it's through medicaid
 
02:24:08.950 --> 02:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
reimbursement or through
 
02:24:11.750 --> 02:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care in the dish program
 
02:24:12.710 --> 02:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
we estimate
 
02:24:15.750 --> 02:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
that about half of the amount 50 is
 
02:24:18.150 --> 02:24:18.160 align:start position:0%
ultimately attributable to reimbursement
 
02:24:19.990 --> 02:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
so if someone has insurance other than
 
02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:20.870 align:start position:0%
so if someone has insurance other than
medicaid

02:24:20.870 --> 02:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
02:24:22.870 --> 02:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
then the state is off the hook for that
 
02:24:22.880 --> 02:24:24.389 align:start position:0%
then the state is off the hook for that
portion

02:24:24.389 --> 02:24:24.399 align:start position:0%
portion
 
02:24:26.710 --> 02:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
but if the person is on medicaid or if
 
02:24:28.150 --> 02:24:28.160 align:start position:0%
they're self-pay
 
02:24:30.469 --> 02:24:30.479 align:start position:0%
which largely ends up as uncompensated
 
02:24:31.910 --> 02:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
care that does fall to the state's
 
02:24:31.920 --> 02:24:33.670 align:start position:0%
care that does fall to the state's
responsibility

02:24:33.670 --> 02:24:33.680 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
02:24:36.230 --> 02:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
the other half almost always falls on
 
02:24:37.830 --> 02:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care
 
02:24:39.670 --> 02:24:39.680 align:start position:0%
which does cost the state through the
 
02:24:41.750 --> 02:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
dish program
 
02:24:43.429 --> 02:24:43.439 align:start position:0%
so we walked through this in detail
 
02:24:45.270 --> 02:24:45.280 align:start position:0%
beginning on page 19 of the report i
 
02:24:45.910 --> 02:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
don't want to
 
02:24:48.870 --> 02:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
take up time here reciting figures the
 
02:24:50.230 --> 02:24:50.240 align:start position:0%
key takeaways i think
 
02:24:51.990 --> 02:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
are that it's actually much more
 
02:24:54.309 --> 02:24:54.319 align:start position:0%
complicated than those calculations
 
02:24:54.319 --> 02:24:55.030 align:start position:0%
complicated than those calculations
anyway

02:24:55.030 --> 02:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
02:24:57.190 --> 02:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
there's the direct cost of boarding in
 
02:24:58.550 --> 02:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
terms of reimbursement
 
02:25:01.349 --> 02:25:01.359 align:start position:0%
on medicaid or uncompensated care which
 
02:25:02.790 --> 02:25:02.800 align:start position:0%
we just highlighted
 
02:25:04.630 --> 02:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
but just as important are the risks to
 
02:25:06.550 --> 02:25:06.560 align:start position:0%
health and safety for other patients and
 
02:25:08.309 --> 02:25:08.319 align:start position:0%
emergency department staff
 
02:25:10.550 --> 02:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
as the chairs noted previously folks in
 
02:25:12.230 --> 02:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
mental health crisis
 
02:25:13.830 --> 02:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
aren't best served in emergency
 
02:25:15.670 --> 02:25:15.680 align:start position:0%
departments that's not what the purpose
 
02:25:17.349 --> 02:25:17.359 align:start position:0%
of emergency departments
 
02:25:19.830 --> 02:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
is and last but not least this is also
 
02:25:21.510 --> 02:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
hardest to quantify
 
02:25:23.429 --> 02:25:23.439 align:start position:0%
is the exacerbation of symptoms while
 
02:25:24.950 --> 02:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
people are being boarded
 
02:25:26.550 --> 02:25:26.560 align:start position:0%
which could lead to longer lengths of
 
02:25:28.950 --> 02:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
stay in the imd more intensive courses
 
02:25:29.910 --> 02:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
of treatment
 
02:25:33.590 --> 02:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
etc i'm open to any questions the chair
 
02:25:34.469 --> 02:25:34.479 align:start position:0%
has them or from
 
02:25:36.870 --> 02:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
other members of the committee are there
 
02:25:38.150 --> 02:25:38.160 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
02:25:40.070 --> 02:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
i i have one if there aren't any from
 
02:25:42.710 --> 02:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:46.710 --> 02:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
okay actually i have two so so as i've
 
02:25:48.950 --> 02:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
heard this problem over and over about
 
02:25:50.230 --> 02:25:50.240 align:start position:0%
emergency room
 
02:25:53.750 --> 02:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
boarding and the throughput issue i keep
 
02:25:55.990 --> 02:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
imagining a graphic that looks like a
 
02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:57.030 align:start position:0%
imagining a graphic that looks like a
pipeline

02:25:57.030 --> 02:25:57.040 align:start position:0%
pipeline
 
02:25:59.590 --> 02:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
that describes volume going through as
 
02:25:59.600 --> 02:26:00.630 align:start position:0%
that describes volume going through as
throughput

02:26:00.630 --> 02:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
throughput
 
02:26:02.550 --> 02:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
and then what the catch points are and
 
02:26:04.070 --> 02:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
how many are popping out
 
02:26:07.590 --> 02:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
and being stuck without able ability to
 
02:26:10.230 --> 02:26:10.240 align:start position:0%
transition to the next
 
02:26:14.469 --> 02:26:14.479 align:start position:0%
phase with the associated costs
 
02:26:17.750 --> 02:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
of those individuals that are trapped
 
02:26:20.550 --> 02:26:20.560 align:start position:0%
uh outside the throughput do you have
 
02:26:22.389 --> 02:26:22.399 align:start position:0%
any cool graphic like that in your
 
02:26:22.399 --> 02:26:24.950 align:start position:0%
any cool graphic like that in your
report

02:26:24.950 --> 02:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:27.110 --> 02:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
so we do have a graphic of kind of the
 
02:26:28.790 --> 02:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
pipeline we could attach
 
02:26:31.510 --> 02:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
the cost to that but it does show and i
 
02:26:32.070 --> 02:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
can actually
 
02:26:34.950 --> 02:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
pull it up on the screen that's all
 
02:26:34.960 --> 02:26:35.510 align:start position:0%
pull it up on the screen that's all
right

02:26:35.510 --> 02:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:26:37.190 --> 02:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
you're just giving me more reason to go
 
02:26:39.190 --> 02:26:39.200 align:start position:0%
look at the report i just we haven't yet
 
02:26:41.030 --> 02:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
because we've been really busy so
 
02:26:43.030 --> 02:26:43.040 align:start position:0%
so i appreciate you coming in and giving
 
02:26:44.710 --> 02:26:44.720 align:start position:0%
us uh uh
 
02:26:46.389 --> 02:26:46.399 align:start position:0%
you know a spoon feeding on this or at
 
02:26:48.630 --> 02:26:48.640 align:start position:0%
least me um
 
02:26:52.309 --> 02:26:52.319 align:start position:0%
uh what was my other oh okay
 
02:26:55.510 --> 02:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
so uh in parallel to this discussion
 
02:26:57.270 --> 02:26:57.280 align:start position:0%
there's a discussion around whether or
 
02:26:58.630 --> 02:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
not the state
 
02:27:04.150 --> 02:27:04.160 align:start position:0%
should be building a a new 60-bed
 
02:27:07.429 --> 02:27:07.439 align:start position:0%
forensic mental health hospital and so
 
02:27:09.830 --> 02:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
there's been some questioning about
 
02:27:11.590 --> 02:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
and there's been some statements on both
 
02:27:13.030 --> 02:27:13.040 align:start position:0%
sides of this
 
02:27:15.590 --> 02:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
of whether or not that having those 60
 
02:27:16.550 --> 02:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
beds if they were
 
02:27:19.590 --> 02:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
assuming they were staffed um that
 
02:27:23.030 --> 02:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
that would be a nice chunk
 
02:27:26.150 --> 02:27:26.160 align:start position:0%
of the solution to our er
 
02:27:29.510 --> 02:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
boarding problem did did you all
 
02:27:32.790 --> 02:27:32.800 align:start position:0%
take a look at that component
 
02:27:34.790 --> 02:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
and whether or not do you have anything
 
02:27:36.710 --> 02:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
categorical to say about whether or not
 
02:27:38.870 --> 02:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
a 60-bed forensic hospital
 
02:27:42.230 --> 02:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
mental health hospital would would or
 
02:27:43.190 --> 02:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
would not
 
02:27:47.110 --> 02:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:49.190 --> 02:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
so i think it would definitely help
 
02:27:51.030 --> 02:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
because there is a kind of one-to-one
 
02:27:52.630 --> 02:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
correlation right every
 
02:27:55.190 --> 02:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh person who is a forensic patient
 
02:27:55.200 --> 02:27:55.670 align:start position:0%
uh person who is a forensic patient
which

02:27:55.670 --> 02:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
which
 
02:27:58.309 --> 02:27:58.319 align:start position:0%
you know are completely on the state's
 
02:27:58.319 --> 02:27:58.710 align:start position:0%
you know are completely on the state's
uh

02:27:58.710 --> 02:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:28:00.389 --> 02:28:00.399 align:start position:0%
finances right there's no medicaid
 
02:28:02.070 --> 02:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
reimbursement or anything available for
 
02:28:02.080 --> 02:28:02.710 align:start position:0%
reimbursement or anything available for
that

02:28:02.710 --> 02:28:02.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:28:04.389 --> 02:28:04.399 align:start position:0%
every person who is a forensic patient
 
02:28:05.830 --> 02:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
at new hampshire hospital who could be
 
02:28:05.840 --> 02:28:06.550 align:start position:0%
at new hampshire hospital who could be
moved

02:28:06.550 --> 02:28:06.560 align:start position:0%
moved
 
02:28:09.270 --> 02:28:09.280 align:start position:0%
uh to a new forensic facility uh would
 
02:28:10.550 --> 02:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
free up a bed
 
02:28:12.309 --> 02:28:12.319 align:start position:0%
right which would which would be filled
 
02:28:13.670 --> 02:28:13.680 align:start position:0%
pretty quickly unfortunately with a
 
02:28:15.830 --> 02:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
waiting list such as it is
 
02:28:17.429 --> 02:28:17.439 align:start position:0%
um i don't have the current numbers of
 
02:28:19.349 --> 02:28:19.359 align:start position:0%
how many forensic patients are admitted
 
02:28:20.710 --> 02:28:20.720 align:start position:0%
at new hampshire hospital i'd have to
 
02:28:23.750 --> 02:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
follow up with uh with joe on that
 
02:28:25.190 --> 02:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
okay i don't want to put words in your
 
02:28:26.950 --> 02:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
mouth but i think part of your answer
 
02:28:26.960 --> 02:28:27.429 align:start position:0%
mouth but i think part of your answer
was

02:28:27.429 --> 02:28:27.439 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:28:29.670 --> 02:28:29.680 align:start position:0%
was no you didn't specifically look at a
 
02:28:29.680 --> 02:28:30.710 align:start position:0%
was no you didn't specifically look at a
60-bed

02:28:30.710 --> 02:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
60-bed
 
02:28:34.950 --> 02:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
hospital being part of a bigger solution
 
02:28:37.110 --> 02:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
that that's correct it wasn't it wasn't
 
02:28:38.550 --> 02:28:38.560 align:start position:0%
part of our report
 
02:28:40.630 --> 02:28:40.640 align:start position:0%
no problem no problem i just i just
 
02:28:42.550 --> 02:28:42.560 align:start position:0%
wanted to know because we have like i
 
02:28:45.510 --> 02:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
said a parallel conversation where
 
02:28:47.190 --> 02:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
we have that issue kicking around as
 
02:28:49.510 --> 02:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
well uh so thank you that was a great
 
02:28:50.630 --> 02:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
briefing uh miss
 
02:28:52.230 --> 02:28:52.240 align:start position:0%
representative erf do you have a
 
02:28:53.750 --> 02:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
question and then representative wallner
 
02:28:55.030 --> 02:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
had her hand up
 
02:28:56.550 --> 02:28:56.560 align:start position:0%
jesus thank you mr jimmy just a quick
 
02:28:58.070 --> 02:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
one i missed when you talk about the
 
02:28:59.270 --> 02:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
savings on the
 
02:29:03.990 --> 02:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:06.830 --> 02:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
yes so we we estimated those at
 
02:29:06.840 --> 02:29:08.230 align:start position:0%
yes so we we estimated those at
approximately

02:29:08.230 --> 02:29:08.240 align:start position:0%
approximately
 
02:29:10.389 --> 02:29:10.399 align:start position:0%
half a reduction of half in the waiting
 
02:29:10.399 --> 02:29:11.510 align:start position:0%
half a reduction of half in the waiting
list

02:29:11.510 --> 02:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
list
 
02:29:14.710 --> 02:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
there's a range of uh in the report 3.3
 
02:29:18.710 --> 02:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
to 4.4 million dollars per year
 
02:29:21.910 --> 02:29:21.920 align:start position:0%
thank you and what what would happen
 
02:29:22.710 --> 02:29:22.720 align:start position:0%
with that one
 
02:29:25.270 --> 02:29:25.280 align:start position:0%
is the implementation is closer to
 
02:29:25.280 --> 02:29:25.990 align:start position:0%
is the implementation is closer to
sometime

02:29:25.990 --> 02:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
sometime
 
02:29:29.270 --> 02:29:29.280 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 23
 
02:29:31.750 --> 02:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
so new hampshire hospitals budget would
 
02:29:31.760 --> 02:29:32.469 align:start position:0%
so new hampshire hospitals budget would
change

02:29:32.469 --> 02:29:32.479 align:start position:0%
change
 
02:29:34.309 --> 02:29:34.319 align:start position:0%
entirely right because they would no
 
02:29:35.990 --> 02:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
longer receive dish
 
02:29:39.429 --> 02:29:39.439 align:start position:0%
or they would receive medicaid and so we
 
02:29:41.190 --> 02:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
would have to come to fiscal committee
 
02:29:43.670 --> 02:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
with basically a redone budget for new
 
02:29:46.950 --> 02:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:50.309 --> 02:29:50.319 align:start position:0%
representative norgren has her hand
 
02:29:52.070 --> 02:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
did you did you understand what ms
 
02:29:55.750 --> 02:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:58.950 --> 02:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
i just had a question um
 
02:30:01.270 --> 02:30:01.280 align:start position:0%
so one of the things that the report
 
02:30:01.280 --> 02:30:02.070 align:start position:0%
so one of the things that the report
says

02:30:02.070 --> 02:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
says
 
02:30:04.389 --> 02:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
is that they would have to re-engage
 
02:30:04.399 --> 02:30:05.190 align:start position:0%
is that they would have to re-engage
outside

02:30:05.190 --> 02:30:05.200 align:start position:0%
outside
 
02:30:08.710 --> 02:30:08.720 align:start position:0%
group to provide those services
 
02:30:11.349 --> 02:30:11.359 align:start position:0%
right now as we know new hampshire
 
02:30:11.359 --> 02:30:13.990 align:start position:0%
right now as we know new hampshire
hospital

02:30:13.990 --> 02:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:16.550 --> 02:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
is currently staffed by some dartmouth
 
02:30:16.560 --> 02:30:17.349 align:start position:0%
is currently staffed by some dartmouth
hitchcock

02:30:17.349 --> 02:30:17.359 align:start position:0%
hitchcock
 
02:30:20.110 --> 02:30:20.120 align:start position:0%
doctors so i was just wondering what the
 
02:30:20.120 --> 02:30:21.670 align:start position:0%
doctors so i was just wondering what the
ramifications

02:30:21.670 --> 02:30:21.680 align:start position:0%
ramifications
 
02:30:26.469 --> 02:30:26.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:28.070 --> 02:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't think it would have any
 
02:30:30.150 --> 02:30:30.160 align:start position:0%
ramifications as far as the services
 
02:30:31.670 --> 02:30:31.680 align:start position:0%
that we need at the hospital from
 
02:30:31.680 --> 02:30:33.270 align:start position:0%
that we need at the hospital from
contractors

02:30:33.270 --> 02:30:33.280 align:start position:0%
contractors
 
02:30:35.830 --> 02:30:35.840 align:start position:0%
i don't think that would change okay
 
02:30:37.750 --> 02:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
there was some reference in the report
 
02:30:41.590 --> 02:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
so okay i think and jay i'll let
 
02:30:43.190 --> 02:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
you jump in here but i think that that's
 
02:30:44.950 --> 02:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
more referencing that there may be other
 
02:30:46.710 --> 02:30:46.720 align:start position:0%
providers that might come to the state
 
02:30:46.720 --> 02:30:47.190 align:start position:0%
providers that might come to the state
and

02:30:47.190 --> 02:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:30:50.389 --> 02:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
and uh open additional beds with this
 
02:30:52.710 --> 02:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
waiver in place
 
02:30:55.590 --> 02:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
yes that that's exactly the uh the
 
02:30:55.600 --> 02:30:56.230 align:start position:0%
yes that that's exactly the uh the
essence

02:30:56.230 --> 02:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
essence
 
02:30:59.429 --> 02:30:59.439 align:start position:0%
uh aaron it's that um it's to attract
 
02:31:01.349 --> 02:31:01.359 align:start position:0%
private sector operators to open a
 
02:31:02.389 --> 02:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
facility i
 
02:31:04.630 --> 02:31:04.640 align:start position:0%
i don't think we uh we didn't express an
 
02:31:07.030 --> 02:31:07.040 align:start position:0%
opinion or recommendation as to which
 
02:31:08.950 --> 02:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
private sector providers those might be
 
02:31:10.710 --> 02:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
there cert there could be some
 
02:31:12.309 --> 02:31:12.319 align:start position:0%
uh within new hampshire but there are
 
02:31:14.070 --> 02:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
certainly some from outside of the state
 
02:31:15.349 --> 02:31:15.359 align:start position:0%
who have expressed
 
02:31:17.110 --> 02:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
uh interest to the commissioner in the
 
02:31:19.830 --> 02:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
past in doing so
 
02:31:21.510 --> 02:31:21.520 align:start position:0%
president of northern your hand is still
 
02:31:23.110 --> 02:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
up do you have a follow-up
 
02:31:26.230 --> 02:31:26.240 align:start position:0%
yes so so we
 
02:31:29.910 --> 02:31:29.920 align:start position:0%
so are we talking about an out of state
 
02:31:32.389 --> 02:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
somebody else running this facility
 
02:31:33.270 --> 02:31:33.280 align:start position:0%
other than
 
02:31:36.389 --> 02:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
the state so not new hampshire hospital
 
02:31:37.510 --> 02:31:37.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire hospital
 
02:31:39.670 --> 02:31:39.680 align:start position:0%
there's no plans to have that run by it
 
02:31:41.110 --> 02:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
by anyone else
 
02:31:43.510 --> 02:31:43.520 align:start position:0%
this would be a provider coming in and
 
02:31:45.030 --> 02:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
opening their own beds that they
 
02:31:45.040 --> 02:31:45.990 align:start position:0%
opening their own beds that they
operated

02:31:45.990 --> 02:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
operated
 
02:31:47.270 --> 02:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
now whether it's an out-of-state
 
02:31:49.110 --> 02:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
provider an in-state provider
 
02:31:50.790 --> 02:31:50.800 align:start position:0%
i mean it could be any of those but
 
02:31:53.990 --> 02:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
think of it similar to like drf beds
 
02:31:55.830 --> 02:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
you know a provider opens those beds in
 
02:31:57.270 --> 02:31:57.280 align:start position:0%
the community
 
02:31:59.349 --> 02:31:59.359 align:start position:0%
and runs and operates them in the
 
02:31:59.359 --> 02:32:02.469 align:start position:0%
and runs and operates them in the
community

02:32:02.469 --> 02:32:02.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:05.590 --> 02:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
very well thank you okay
 
02:32:07.990 --> 02:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
i want to do a time check it's a couple
 
02:32:09.429 --> 02:32:09.439 align:start position:0%
minutes after
 
02:32:11.190 --> 02:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
uh i had been thinking that we would
 
02:32:12.790 --> 02:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
take a 12 15
 
02:32:17.429 --> 02:32:17.439 align:start position:0%
uh break for lunch until one o'clock
 
02:32:20.870 --> 02:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh so we got a couple of scarcities to
 
02:32:23.830 --> 02:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
manage here one is we still have uh
 
02:32:25.510 --> 02:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
another line item at least
 
02:32:29.510 --> 02:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
from a m and we have ms rounds you're
 
02:32:32.070 --> 02:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
you you go away this afternoon at some
 
02:32:33.910 --> 02:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
point at two o'clock i think
 
02:32:35.910 --> 02:32:35.920 align:start position:0%
i do i actually was able to extend that
 
02:32:38.389 --> 02:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
to 2 30. so
 
02:32:40.710 --> 02:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
because i i want to i don't know if you
 
02:32:42.630 --> 02:32:42.640 align:start position:0%
had a chance to reflect on the
 
02:32:45.030 --> 02:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
footnote question and then the other
 
02:32:46.550 --> 02:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
questions that we asked
 
02:32:48.710 --> 02:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
uh for you to come in today it seemed
 
02:32:49.910 --> 02:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
like you had
 
02:32:53.270 --> 02:32:53.280 align:start position:0%
the stage on about five items today
 
02:32:56.070 --> 02:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
yes i i think that we'll be able to to
 
02:32:59.270 --> 02:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:01.990 --> 02:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
representative wallner your hand is up i
 
02:33:02.950 --> 02:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
just wanted to know
 
02:33:06.150 --> 02:33:06.160 align:start position:0%
if you are planning to go past
 
02:33:09.830 --> 02:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
3 15 because if so
 
02:33:13.590 --> 02:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
um i need to uh kathy
 
02:33:15.510 --> 02:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
sharon and i need to make another
 
02:33:15.520 --> 02:33:17.910 align:start position:0%
sharon and i need to make another
arrangement

02:33:17.910 --> 02:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
arrangement
 
02:33:21.429 --> 02:33:21.439 align:start position:0%
so okay i'm sorry i'm this is one of
 
02:33:21.439 --> 02:33:21.830 align:start position:0%
so okay i'm sorry i'm this is one of
those

02:33:21.830 --> 02:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:33:25.030 --> 02:33:25.040 align:start position:0%
technical answers that people made sorry
 
02:33:27.190 --> 02:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
my no it's all right i'm uh because
 
02:33:28.950 --> 02:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
you're the one that has to listen to my
 
02:33:30.630 --> 02:33:30.640 align:start position:0%
answer but
 
02:33:35.990 --> 02:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
so uh i am not planning to go past 315
 
02:33:39.030 --> 02:33:39.040 align:start position:0%
but i am planning to
 
02:33:41.110 --> 02:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
hit a pretty heavy agenda that i sent
 
02:33:42.230 --> 02:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
out before
 
02:33:45.270 --> 02:33:45.280 align:start position:0%
uh we started this morning and
 
02:33:48.309 --> 02:33:48.319 align:start position:0%
i can imagine that that agenda
 
02:33:51.110 --> 02:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
demanding more time than we have between
 
02:33:53.110 --> 02:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
1 and 3 15.
 
02:33:55.349 --> 02:33:55.359 align:start position:0%
and because today is such a critical day
 
02:33:56.630 --> 02:33:56.640 align:start position:0%
for us to try to get
 
02:34:00.790 --> 02:34:00.800 align:start position:0%
information so we know we're asking
 
02:34:04.309 --> 02:34:04.319 align:start position:0%
of mr ripple um i i
 
02:34:07.429 --> 02:34:07.439 align:start position:0%
i really have a strong desire to push
 
02:34:11.190 --> 02:34:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:14.230 --> 02:34:14.240 align:start position:0%
okay so i guess my question is if we
 
02:34:16.230 --> 02:34:16.240 align:start position:0%
have a 315 commitment
 
02:34:19.349 --> 02:34:19.359 align:start position:0%
should we be now letting them know that
 
02:34:22.150 --> 02:34:22.160 align:start position:0%
we won't be there or
 
02:34:24.790 --> 02:34:24.800 align:start position:0%
how how how long is your commitment it
 
02:34:25.590 --> 02:34:25.600 align:start position:0%
would probably
 
02:34:30.550 --> 02:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
it would probably be for one hour
 
02:34:33.830 --> 02:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
um before you go i think you guys should
 
02:34:33.840 --> 02:34:34.230 align:start position:0%
um before you go i think you guys should
go

02:34:34.230 --> 02:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
go
 
02:34:35.670 --> 02:34:35.680 align:start position:0%
be able to do your commitment
 
02:34:37.910 --> 02:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
particularly if you don't have travel
 
02:34:40.230 --> 02:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
uh you're doing the zoom thing i assume
 
02:34:41.990 --> 02:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
um yes yes it's soon
 
02:34:46.630 --> 02:34:46.640 align:start position:0%
um i i think we could agree
 
02:34:49.270 --> 02:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
to have you suggest what we could
 
02:34:51.910 --> 02:34:51.920 align:start position:0%
continue to talk about in your absence
 
02:34:55.110 --> 02:34:55.120 align:start position:0%
and it's all going to be recorded and
 
02:34:56.870 --> 02:34:56.880 align:start position:0%
if if you want to leave one person
 
02:34:58.550 --> 02:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
behind to sort of
 
02:35:00.710 --> 02:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
you know participate live with us maybe
 
02:35:02.070 --> 02:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
that's an approach
 
02:35:05.670 --> 02:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
but i i i'll try to try to give you some
 
02:35:09.110 --> 02:35:09.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do your 315 obligation
 
02:35:10.870 --> 02:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
could i ask that there be no votes
 
02:35:12.950 --> 02:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
during that during that oh absolutely
 
02:35:13.990 --> 02:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
that's that
 
02:35:16.630 --> 02:35:16.640 align:start position:0%
yeah i wouldn't even consider that okay
 
02:35:17.190 --> 02:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:35:18.870 --> 02:35:18.880 align:start position:0%
i think that clears that up for me thank
 
02:35:18.880 --> 02:35:21.030 align:start position:0%
i think that clears that up for me thank
you

02:35:21.030 --> 02:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:35:24.469 --> 02:35:24.479 align:start position:0%
so all right so we just used uh
 
02:35:27.590 --> 02:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
four minutes of your time available so
 
02:35:30.070 --> 02:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
we can end it around 12 15. mr
 
02:35:33.750 --> 02:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
nagy can you do that we will certainly
 
02:35:35.830 --> 02:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
try so i'm going to go ahead and turn it
 
02:35:36.710 --> 02:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
right over
 
02:35:40.150 --> 02:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
to drew smith
 
02:35:42.150 --> 02:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
great thank you karen and i i'd like to
 
02:35:43.510 --> 02:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
thank the chairman and the other members
 
02:35:45.590 --> 02:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the opportunity to
 
02:35:47.270 --> 02:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
discuss our review of the developmental
 
02:35:47.280 --> 02:35:48.309 align:start position:0%
discuss our review of the developmental
disabilities

02:35:48.309 --> 02:35:48.319 align:start position:0%
disabilities
 
02:35:50.550 --> 02:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
delivery system operated by the bureau
 
02:35:52.070 --> 02:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
of developmental services
 
02:35:53.750 --> 02:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is drew smith
 
02:35:55.910 --> 02:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
with alvarez and marcel
 
02:35:57.110 --> 02:35:57.120 align:start position:0%
in our discussion today about the
 
02:35:58.710 --> 02:35:58.720 align:start position:0%
funding requests for the developmental
 
02:36:00.469 --> 02:36:00.479 align:start position:0%
disabilities redesign
 
02:36:01.750 --> 02:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
i would like to frame this discussion
 
02:36:04.070 --> 02:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
around two buckets bucket one comprises
 
02:36:05.750 --> 02:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
of a waiver redesign
 
02:36:07.750 --> 02:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
rate development and a modernization of
 
02:36:09.190 --> 02:36:09.200 align:start position:0%
i.t infrastructure
 
02:36:10.870 --> 02:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
bucket two includes our recommendation
 
02:36:13.750 --> 02:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
related to intensive treatment services
 
02:36:16.070 --> 02:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
in relation to the first bucket of items
 
02:36:17.990 --> 02:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
our team conducted an in-depth review of
 
02:36:20.389 --> 02:36:20.399 align:start position:0%
the dd service system in new hampshire
 
02:36:21.910 --> 02:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
we concluded that under current
 
02:36:24.070 --> 02:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
processes there are inadequate controls
 
02:36:25.750 --> 02:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
in place to manage waiver spend
 
02:36:28.309 --> 02:36:28.319 align:start position:0%
and to control cost this lack of
 
02:36:30.309 --> 02:36:30.319 align:start position:0%
operational control has led to an
 
02:36:32.070 --> 02:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
inequitable system of haves and
 
02:36:34.630 --> 02:36:34.640 align:start position:0%
have-nots in new hampshire
 
02:36:36.150 --> 02:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
these inequities are driven by three
 
02:36:38.469 --> 02:36:38.479 align:start position:0%
primary factors an unfettered waiver
 
02:36:38.479 --> 02:36:39.349 align:start position:0%
primary factors an unfettered waiver
structure

02:36:39.349 --> 02:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
structure
 
02:36:42.710 --> 02:36:42.720 align:start position:0%
antiquated rates and the in inadequate
 
02:36:44.230 --> 02:36:44.240 align:start position:0%
access to data
 
02:36:45.990 --> 02:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
specifically under current waiver
 
02:36:48.230 --> 02:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
operations all participants have access
 
02:36:49.990 --> 02:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
to all services once they enter the
 
02:36:51.429 --> 02:36:51.439 align:start position:0%
system with few controls
 
02:36:53.270 --> 02:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
to help guide individuals to the most
 
02:36:55.750 --> 02:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate services based on need
 
02:36:57.510 --> 02:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
under the current reimbursement rates
 
02:36:58.870 --> 02:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
which have not gone through a
 
02:37:00.790 --> 02:37:00.800 align:start position:0%
substantive redevelopment process
 
02:37:03.670 --> 02:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
since calendar year 2007 there is little
 
02:37:05.429 --> 02:37:05.439 align:start position:0%
historical understanding of the cost
 
02:37:07.429 --> 02:37:07.439 align:start position:0%
basis or assumptions used in the current
 
02:37:07.439 --> 02:37:08.230 align:start position:0%
basis or assumptions used in the current
rates

02:37:08.230 --> 02:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
rates
 
02:37:09.830 --> 02:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
leading to further misalignment between
 
02:37:13.110 --> 02:37:13.120 align:start position:0%
service costs and service reimbursement
 
02:37:16.630 --> 02:37:16.640 align:start position:0%
and lastly as provided in testimony by
 
02:37:18.710 --> 02:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
dltss earlier this week
 
02:37:21.590 --> 02:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
bds operates using outdated siloed data
 
02:37:23.190 --> 02:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
systems preventing its ability to more
 
02:37:24.950 --> 02:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
robustly manage the system
 
02:37:27.830 --> 02:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
and authorize and monitor services as
 
02:37:29.510 --> 02:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
outlined in our report we strongly
 
02:37:30.710 --> 02:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
recommend that interventions be
 
02:37:30.720 --> 02:37:31.349 align:start position:0%
recommend that interventions be
undertaken

02:37:31.349 --> 02:37:31.359 align:start position:0%
undertaken
 
02:37:32.710 --> 02:37:32.720 align:start position:0%
to correct these challenges core to
 
02:37:35.190 --> 02:37:35.200 align:start position:0%
service management such investment will
 
02:37:35.200 --> 02:37:35.910 align:start position:0%
service management such investment will
realign

02:37:35.910 --> 02:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
realign
 
02:37:37.750 --> 02:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
service spend with individual needs much
 
02:37:39.830 --> 02:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
more appropriately
 
02:37:41.349 --> 02:37:41.359 align:start position:0%
the goal of these recommendations is to
 
02:37:43.110 --> 02:37:43.120 align:start position:0%
move away from a system of haves and
 
02:37:43.120 --> 02:37:43.830 align:start position:0%
move away from a system of haves and
have-nots

02:37:43.830 --> 02:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
have-nots
 
02:37:45.510 --> 02:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
to one where each participant gets what
 
02:37:48.070 --> 02:37:48.080 align:start position:0%
they need no more no less
 
02:37:49.750 --> 02:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
this occurs through better utilization
 
02:37:52.150 --> 02:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
management rates that more appropriately
 
02:37:53.590 --> 02:37:53.600 align:start position:0%
cover service costs
 
02:37:55.510 --> 02:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
and helping align the array of services
 
02:37:57.349 --> 02:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
someone accesses at the initial point of
 
02:37:57.359 --> 02:37:58.790 align:start position:0%
someone accesses at the initial point of
enrollment

02:37:58.790 --> 02:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
enrollment
 
02:38:00.389 --> 02:38:00.399 align:start position:0%
these are key to long-term system
 
02:38:02.710 --> 02:38:02.720 align:start position:0%
sustainability and are an important step
 
02:38:04.070 --> 02:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
to promoting outcomes for those with
 
02:38:05.270 --> 02:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities in new
 
02:38:05.280 --> 02:38:06.630 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities in new
hampshire

02:38:06.630 --> 02:38:06.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:38:08.070 --> 02:38:08.080 align:start position:0%
the total investment to the state as
 
02:38:09.830 --> 02:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
outlined in the report for these three
 
02:38:11.910 --> 02:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
recommendations is between 800 000 to
 
02:38:14.630 --> 02:38:14.640 align:start position:0%
1.2 million dollars however
 
02:38:16.710 --> 02:38:16.720 align:start position:0%
by not making these investments the
 
02:38:18.309 --> 02:38:18.319 align:start position:0%
issues outlined earlier will continue to
 
02:38:19.830 --> 02:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
compound and drive the likelihood of
 
02:38:20.950 --> 02:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
over serving some
 
02:38:23.110 --> 02:38:23.120 align:start position:0%
or more importantly underserving others
 
02:38:25.910 --> 02:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
raising risks to health and safety
 
02:38:27.510 --> 02:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
shifting to bucket 2 i would like to
 
02:38:29.190 --> 02:38:29.200 align:start position:0%
take a moment to briefly touch on the
 
02:38:31.270 --> 02:38:31.280 align:start position:0%
larger financial industry services in
 
02:38:32.309 --> 02:38:32.319 align:start position:0%
our report
 
02:38:35.270 --> 02:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
intensive treatment services as noted in
 
02:38:35.910 --> 02:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
our report
 
02:38:38.070 --> 02:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
at the time of writing 38 individuals
 
02:38:39.670 --> 02:38:39.680 align:start position:0%
were being served in out-of-state
 
02:38:41.990 --> 02:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
long-term residential services at an
 
02:38:43.270 --> 02:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
average cost of three hundred and eighty
 
02:38:45.270 --> 02:38:45.280 align:start position:0%
four thousand dollars per person
 
02:38:47.030 --> 02:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
peaking at just under five hundred
 
02:38:48.389 --> 02:38:48.399 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars per person in some
 
02:38:48.399 --> 02:38:49.590 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars per person in some
cases

02:38:49.590 --> 02:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
cases
 
02:38:51.670 --> 02:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
more directly this group accounts for
 
02:38:53.190 --> 02:38:53.200 align:start position:0%
less than one percent of the waiver
 
02:38:54.950 --> 02:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
population but five percent of total
 
02:38:54.960 --> 02:38:56.389 align:start position:0%
population but five percent of total
spend

02:38:56.389 --> 02:38:56.399 align:start position:0%
spend
 
02:38:58.469 --> 02:38:58.479 align:start position:0%
beyond cost importantly is the impact on
 
02:38:59.510 --> 02:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
people being moved
 
02:39:00.710 --> 02:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
out of their local new hampshire
 
02:39:02.550 --> 02:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
communities and away from family and
 
02:39:04.550 --> 02:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
natural supports
 
02:39:06.070 --> 02:39:06.080 align:start position:0%
driving this need for out of state
 
02:39:08.630 --> 02:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
placements is an is inadequacy and
 
02:39:10.150 --> 02:39:10.160 align:start position:0%
current reimbursement rates
 
02:39:11.590 --> 02:39:11.600 align:start position:0%
as well as lacking community
 
02:39:13.270 --> 02:39:13.280 align:start position:0%
infrastructure to support the complexity
 
02:39:14.070 --> 02:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
of needs
 
02:39:16.870 --> 02:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
of these individuals our report calls
 
02:39:18.389 --> 02:39:18.399 align:start position:0%
for our partnership between the state
 
02:39:19.910 --> 02:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
and private providers to build out the
 
02:39:21.429 --> 02:39:21.439 align:start position:0%
physical infrastructure
 
02:39:23.190 --> 02:39:23.200 align:start position:0%
needs for these supports and a rate
 
02:39:24.630 --> 02:39:24.640 align:start position:0%
schedule that can more appropriately
 
02:39:25.910 --> 02:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
support these individuals in new
 
02:39:25.920 --> 02:39:27.670 align:start position:0%
support these individuals in new
hampshire

02:39:27.670 --> 02:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:39:29.590 --> 02:39:29.600 align:start position:0%
while we do project potential long-term
 
02:39:30.950 --> 02:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
cost savings in this approach
 
02:39:32.710 --> 02:39:32.720 align:start position:0%
it will require investment by the state
 
02:39:34.710 --> 02:39:34.720 align:start position:0%
to incentivize this shift
 
02:39:35.910 --> 02:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
depending on the level of state
 
02:39:37.990 --> 02:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
investment we project the state could
 
02:39:40.469 --> 02:39:40.479 align:start position:0%
break even within five years more
 
02:39:41.510 --> 02:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
importantly however
 
02:39:44.070 --> 02:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
is bringing people back home reuniting
 
02:39:44.950 --> 02:39:44.960 align:start position:0%
these families
 
02:39:46.309 --> 02:39:46.319 align:start position:0%
and providing opportunities for
 
02:39:47.750 --> 02:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
individuals to re-engage in their new
 
02:39:49.429 --> 02:39:49.439 align:start position:0%
hampshire communities
 
02:39:50.870 --> 02:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
i hope this information helps in your
 
02:39:52.469 --> 02:39:52.479 align:start position:0%
review and i thank you for your time and
 
02:39:54.469 --> 02:39:54.479 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to answer questions
 
02:39:57.990 --> 02:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
i have a question um i'm looking at the
 
02:40:00.550 --> 02:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
estimated one-time costs the range
 
02:40:03.910 --> 02:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
between 5.9 and 6.9
 
02:40:06.389 --> 02:40:06.399 align:start position:0%
and then i'm looking over at the
 
02:40:08.469 --> 02:40:08.479 align:start position:0%
personnel costs
 
02:40:11.990 --> 02:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
oh okay that answer never mind uh but
 
02:40:15.590 --> 02:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
but so i'm looking at 5.9 to 6.9
 
02:40:18.790 --> 02:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
how much of that's a lot of money so
 
02:40:19.990 --> 02:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
what are we investing in
 
02:40:23.030 --> 02:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:24.630 --> 02:40:24.640 align:start position:0%
sure it's a really good question you're
 
02:40:26.550 --> 02:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
correct it is a lot of money um
 
02:40:28.550 --> 02:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
you know what i'll say in our review of
 
02:40:30.150 --> 02:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
the service system is there there's been
 
02:40:31.510 --> 02:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
a lack of investment to be
 
02:40:33.910 --> 02:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
to be blunt in the dd infrastructure
 
02:40:35.910 --> 02:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
over over a longer period of time
 
02:40:38.230 --> 02:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
the majority of this investment is
 
02:40:39.510 --> 02:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
really around the
 
02:40:42.389 --> 02:40:42.399 align:start position:0%
the development of the in in-state
 
02:40:43.750 --> 02:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
intensive treatment services
 
02:40:45.830 --> 02:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
there's an infrastructure need that that
 
02:40:47.910 --> 02:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
the state needs to partner with provider
 
02:40:50.070 --> 02:40:50.080 align:start position:0%
private providers to really build out uh
 
02:40:51.830 --> 02:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
that includes specialized group homes
 
02:40:54.309 --> 02:40:54.319 align:start position:0%
specialized capacity within those homes
 
02:40:55.830 --> 02:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm so sorry i
 
02:40:58.469 --> 02:40:58.479 align:start position:0%
i i we only have just a few more minutes
 
02:40:58.479 --> 02:40:58.870 align:start position:0%
i i we only have just a few more minutes
and

02:40:58.870 --> 02:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:41:02.950 --> 02:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
i hate but um okay so when i hear
 
02:41:06.309 --> 02:41:06.319 align:start position:0%
infrastructure i think things i don't
 
02:41:08.710 --> 02:41:08.720 align:start position:0%
i don't think people and services i
 
02:41:08.720 --> 02:41:09.349 align:start position:0%
i don't think people and services i
think

02:41:09.349 --> 02:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:41:12.550 --> 02:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
buildings networks like physical
 
02:41:16.469 --> 02:41:16.479 align:start position:0%
networks pulling electricity you know
 
02:41:19.510 --> 02:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
hard infrastructure are you using
 
02:41:21.590 --> 02:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
the word the same way as i am or are you
 
02:41:22.950 --> 02:41:22.960 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
02:41:26.150 --> 02:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
service capability by having more
 
02:41:29.030 --> 02:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
providers coordinating and talking with
 
02:41:31.510 --> 02:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
one another
 
02:41:33.750 --> 02:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
sure no this is talking about physical
 
02:41:35.349 --> 02:41:35.359 align:start position:0%
infrastructure for the need for
 
02:41:35.359 --> 02:41:36.070 align:start position:0%
infrastructure for the need for
intensive

02:41:36.070 --> 02:41:36.080 align:start position:0%
intensive
 
02:41:37.750 --> 02:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
supports for these individuals typically
 
02:41:39.110 --> 02:41:39.120 align:start position:0%
dually diagnosed
 
02:41:41.030 --> 02:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
there's not a capacity right now in the
 
02:41:42.630 --> 02:41:42.640 align:start position:0%
current group home structure within the
 
02:41:44.070 --> 02:41:44.080 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire to support these
 
02:41:44.080 --> 02:41:45.429 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire to support these
individuals

02:41:45.429 --> 02:41:45.439 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
02:41:47.590 --> 02:41:47.600 align:start position:0%
within the state and so this is a
 
02:41:49.670 --> 02:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
infrastructure development of a grant
 
02:41:49.680 --> 02:41:50.309 align:start position:0%
infrastructure development of a grant
program

02:41:50.309 --> 02:41:50.319 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:41:52.469 --> 02:41:52.479 align:start position:0%
to work with providers to build physical
 
02:41:52.479 --> 02:41:53.910 align:start position:0%
to work with providers to build physical
infrastructure

02:41:53.910 --> 02:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
02:41:55.429 --> 02:41:55.439 align:start position:0%
to be able to bring people home to have
 
02:41:57.030 --> 02:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
a safe place for them to reside within
 
02:41:58.790 --> 02:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire
 
02:42:01.429 --> 02:42:01.439 align:start position:0%
so is this really truly a one-time cost
 
02:42:01.439 --> 02:42:01.830 align:start position:0%
so is this really truly a one-time cost
or

02:42:01.830 --> 02:42:01.840 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:42:04.150 --> 02:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
are we going to constantly need to be
 
02:42:05.030 --> 02:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
building out
 
02:42:10.309 --> 02:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:11.910 --> 02:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
that's a good question right i mean the
 
02:42:13.670 --> 02:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
intent here is to
 
02:42:15.510 --> 02:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
have these be a grant program that the
 
02:42:17.429 --> 02:42:17.439 align:start position:0%
state invests in to help providers build
 
02:42:18.790 --> 02:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
the initial set
 
02:42:20.469 --> 02:42:20.479 align:start position:0%
uh i wish i could tell you there are
 
02:42:22.070 --> 02:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
going to be people with
 
02:42:23.590 --> 02:42:23.600 align:start position:0%
complex needs coming back into your
 
02:42:25.590 --> 02:42:25.600 align:start position:0%
system there will probably be a need to
 
02:42:27.830 --> 02:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
continuously develop this program
 
02:42:29.429 --> 02:42:29.439 align:start position:0%
i can't say there have been new people
 
02:42:30.950 --> 02:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
that have been served in holiday
 
02:42:32.309 --> 02:42:32.319 align:start position:0%
placement since the writing of our
 
02:42:32.319 --> 02:42:33.349 align:start position:0%
placement since the writing of our
report

02:42:33.349 --> 02:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
report
 
02:42:35.030 --> 02:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
so there is a need there and so there
 
02:42:36.469 --> 02:42:36.479 align:start position:0%
will be more investment i think this
 
02:42:37.269 --> 02:42:37.279 align:start position:0%
initial call
 
02:42:40.070 --> 02:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
is to really incentivize initial
 
02:42:42.070 --> 02:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
development of this service in the state
 
02:42:44.230 --> 02:42:44.240 align:start position:0%
to get out of the uh the practice of
 
02:42:45.830 --> 02:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
sending people to other states for the
 
02:42:45.840 --> 02:42:46.389 align:start position:0%
sending people to other states for the
service

02:42:46.389 --> 02:42:46.399 align:start position:0%
service
 
02:42:49.030 --> 02:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
and building the provider capacity
 
02:42:49.040 --> 02:42:49.910 align:start position:0%
and building the provider capacity
representative

02:42:49.910 --> 02:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:42:53.110 --> 02:42:53.120 align:start position:0%
you have a question i i do
 
02:42:56.790 --> 02:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
so my understanding of this i
 
02:42:59.910 --> 02:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
um don't have a deep understanding of it
 
02:43:00.870 --> 02:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
for sure
 
02:43:03.510 --> 02:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
but my understanding is that presently i
 
02:43:05.349 --> 02:43:05.359 align:start position:0%
miss the number of people you said but
 
02:43:07.510 --> 02:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
presently we're sending people
 
02:43:11.349 --> 02:43:11.359 align:start position:0%
um to providers that provide
 
02:43:14.230 --> 02:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
intensive services and i think a lot of
 
02:43:14.950 --> 02:43:14.960 align:start position:0%
them are in
 
02:43:17.990 --> 02:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
um are a lot of the folks are in
 
02:43:21.110 --> 02:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
uh florida is that my understanding am i
 
02:43:21.120 --> 02:43:22.870 align:start position:0%
uh florida is that my understanding am i
correct correct

02:43:22.870 --> 02:43:22.880 align:start position:0%
correct correct
 
02:43:24.710 --> 02:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
and how many how many people are we
 
02:43:24.720 --> 02:43:27.190 align:start position:0%
and how many how many people are we
sending

02:43:27.190 --> 02:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:29.110 --> 02:43:29.120 align:start position:0%
so there when we wrote this report there
 
02:43:31.030 --> 02:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
were 38 individuals served in
 
02:43:32.630 --> 02:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
out-of-state placements primarily in
 
02:43:34.230 --> 02:43:34.240 align:start position:0%
florida but also in pennsylvania and
 
02:43:34.240 --> 02:43:35.510 align:start position:0%
florida but also in pennsylvania and
massachusetts

02:43:35.510 --> 02:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
02:43:38.870 --> 02:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
okay so we are
 
02:43:41.990 --> 02:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
so i assume those those um
 
02:43:43.910 --> 02:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
providers that are providing the service
 
02:43:46.630 --> 02:43:46.640 align:start position:0%
to our to our residents
 
02:43:50.630 --> 02:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
just send us a bill for them um or do we
 
02:43:50.640 --> 02:43:51.590 align:start position:0%
just send us a bill for them um or do we
negotiate

02:43:51.590 --> 02:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
negotiate
 
02:43:57.590 --> 02:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:59.670 --> 02:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
uh you know it's a little bit of both
 
02:44:01.030 --> 02:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
right i mean there is a negotiated
 
02:44:02.469 --> 02:44:02.479 align:start position:0%
contract karen i don't know if you want
 
02:44:03.110 --> 02:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
to talk more
 
02:44:04.790 --> 02:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
more directly around the contracting
 
02:44:06.710 --> 02:44:06.720 align:start position:0%
agreements with the state and the
 
02:44:08.790 --> 02:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
private providers but
 
02:44:10.710 --> 02:44:10.720 align:start position:0%
there is negotiation that happens with
 
02:44:12.150 --> 02:44:12.160 align:start position:0%
out-of-state providers just like every
 
02:44:13.910 --> 02:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
other state negotiates with with similar
 
02:44:13.920 --> 02:44:16.950 align:start position:0%
other state negotiates with with similar
services

02:44:16.950 --> 02:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:19.910 --> 02:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
yes yes deb is also on the line i think
 
02:44:21.750 --> 02:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
some of the the struggle is the capacity
 
02:44:22.309 --> 02:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
and the
 
02:44:25.750 --> 02:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
the number of of types of providers
 
02:44:27.269 --> 02:44:27.279 align:start position:0%
across the country that are available to
 
02:44:29.269 --> 02:44:29.279 align:start position:0%
do this so by building our own capacity
 
02:44:30.309 --> 02:44:30.319 align:start position:0%
we build
 
02:44:33.110 --> 02:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
competition that that um that lowers
 
02:44:34.150 --> 02:44:34.160 align:start position:0%
that cost
 
02:44:36.230 --> 02:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
um i think deb is also on the line to
 
02:44:38.070 --> 02:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
talk hopefully maybe just for a minute i
 
02:44:38.469 --> 02:44:38.479 align:start position:0%
know we're
 
02:44:40.950 --> 02:44:40.960 align:start position:0%
at the lunch time but about provider
 
02:44:40.960 --> 02:44:42.389 align:start position:0%
at the lunch time but about provider
engagement

02:44:42.389 --> 02:44:42.399 align:start position:0%
engagement
 
02:44:44.070 --> 02:44:44.080 align:start position:0%
well we're bringing her in let's at
 
02:44:46.630 --> 02:44:46.640 align:start position:0%
least hear representative erf's question
 
02:44:50.230 --> 02:44:50.240 align:start position:0%
in case she's got a twofer opportunity
 
02:44:52.309 --> 02:44:52.319 align:start position:0%
great thank you just very quickly i
 
02:44:53.429 --> 02:44:53.439 align:start position:0%
didn't catch the savings
 
02:44:55.349 --> 02:44:55.359 align:start position:0%
for the two buckets you talked that mr
 
02:44:58.950 --> 02:44:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:01.269 --> 02:45:01.279 align:start position:0%
sure so so again we project that within
 
02:45:02.150 --> 02:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
five years
 
02:45:03.750 --> 02:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
the break even on the initial grant
 
02:45:06.309 --> 02:45:06.319 align:start position:0%
investment of the uh its program
 
02:45:08.070 --> 02:45:08.080 align:start position:0%
would be achieved and then part of that
 
02:45:09.510 --> 02:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
is really dependent on the
 
02:45:11.269 --> 02:45:11.279 align:start position:0%
individualized rates of participants
 
02:45:12.469 --> 02:45:12.479 align:start position:0%
once during the state
 
02:45:14.710 --> 02:45:14.720 align:start position:0%
so we do project ongoing savings we
 
02:45:16.870 --> 02:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
projected that between point seven
 
02:45:18.710 --> 02:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
or seven hundred thousand to two point
 
02:45:19.990 --> 02:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
three million dollars
 
02:45:22.630 --> 02:45:22.640 align:start position:0%
annually again there's a lot of
 
02:45:24.230 --> 02:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
individualized person
 
02:45:27.110 --> 02:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
centered pieces to that uh similar with
 
02:45:29.190 --> 02:45:29.200 align:start position:0%
bucket one around the waiver redesign
 
02:45:30.790 --> 02:45:30.800 align:start position:0%
and rates there's a lot of policy
 
02:45:32.389 --> 02:45:32.399 align:start position:0%
decisions that will drive
 
02:45:34.950 --> 02:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
to the impacts of those numbers that we
 
02:45:36.070 --> 02:45:36.080 align:start position:0%
did not want to
 
02:45:39.030 --> 02:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
project policy in this approach and so
 
02:45:40.389 --> 02:45:40.399 align:start position:0%
yeah we did not put
 
02:45:42.790 --> 02:45:42.800 align:start position:0%
forward a projected savings in that
 
02:45:42.800 --> 02:45:43.670 align:start position:0%
forward a projected savings in that
bucket

02:45:43.670 --> 02:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
bucket
 
02:45:47.990 --> 02:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:49.990 --> 02:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
representative uh it's deb sheets the
 
02:45:51.510 --> 02:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
director of long term supports and
 
02:45:53.429 --> 02:45:53.439 align:start position:0%
services and i just wanted to
 
02:45:57.110 --> 02:45:57.120 align:start position:0%
provide um some additional contacts for
 
02:45:59.670 --> 02:45:59.680 align:start position:0%
the question by representative wallner
 
02:46:00.950 --> 02:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh as you know the
 
02:46:02.950 --> 02:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
state contracts with the 10 area
 
02:46:05.750 --> 02:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
agencies and the area agencies
 
02:46:08.790 --> 02:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
are the entities that provide that do
 
02:46:10.309 --> 02:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
the contracting
 
02:46:13.510 --> 02:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
with the out-of-state providers as
 
02:46:16.389 --> 02:46:16.399 align:start position:0%
needed for intensive treatment services
 
02:46:18.469 --> 02:46:18.479 align:start position:0%
i think it's important to understand
 
02:46:20.389 --> 02:46:20.399 align:start position:0%
that when we started working directly
 
02:46:21.110 --> 02:46:21.120 align:start position:0%
with a
 
02:46:23.670 --> 02:46:23.680 align:start position:0%
m the first thing we did is look back
 
02:46:25.429 --> 02:46:25.439 align:start position:0%
before we looked forward
 
02:46:29.030 --> 02:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
and in 2019 sb 86 directed the
 
02:46:30.710 --> 02:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
department to take a look
 
02:46:32.870 --> 02:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
through a commission study with our
 
02:46:34.469 --> 02:46:34.479 align:start position:0%
partners in the legislature
 
02:46:37.269 --> 02:46:37.279 align:start position:0%
at how we provide supports and services
 
02:46:40.070 --> 02:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
for individuals with dual diagnosis
 
02:46:42.309 --> 02:46:42.319 align:start position:0%
and that report clearly indicated that
 
02:46:44.389 --> 02:46:44.399 align:start position:0%
we had
 
02:46:46.790 --> 02:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
not the best continuum of care and that
 
02:46:48.469 --> 02:46:48.479 align:start position:0%
we needed to take a look at addressing
 
02:46:50.230 --> 02:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
this moving forward that was one of the
 
02:46:52.389 --> 02:46:52.399 align:start position:0%
first study reports that i handed over
 
02:46:52.950 --> 02:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
to a
 
02:46:55.429 --> 02:46:55.439 align:start position:0%
m and that helped provide context for
 
02:46:56.630 --> 02:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
the dialogue
 
02:46:59.190 --> 02:46:59.200 align:start position:0%
that had pretty significant stakeholder
 
02:47:00.870 --> 02:47:00.880 align:start position:0%
engagement on the part of the area
 
02:47:02.950 --> 02:47:02.960 align:start position:0%
agencies the legislature as well as
 
02:47:02.960 --> 02:47:03.830 align:start position:0%
agencies the legislature as well as
families

02:47:03.830 --> 02:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
families
 
02:47:07.269 --> 02:47:07.279 align:start position:0%
and experts then in 2020 hb4
 
02:47:09.510 --> 02:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
directed the department to work with the
 
02:47:11.429 --> 02:47:11.439 align:start position:0%
governor's commission on disabilities to
 
02:47:13.590 --> 02:47:13.600 align:start position:0%
take a look at our system overall and
 
02:47:15.910 --> 02:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
opportunities for improvement
 
02:47:18.469 --> 02:47:18.479 align:start position:0%
and there was a report that was issued
 
02:47:20.070 --> 02:47:20.080 align:start position:0%
relative to that that
 
02:47:23.590 --> 02:47:23.600 align:start position:0%
took a look at the possibility of
 
02:47:26.230 --> 02:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
creating in in-state supports for
 
02:47:28.309 --> 02:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
intensive treatment services
 
02:47:30.550 --> 02:47:30.560 align:start position:0%
it took a look at what we were
 
02:47:32.469 --> 02:47:32.479 align:start position:0%
considering relative to case management
 
02:47:34.710 --> 02:47:34.720 align:start position:0%
to autism spectrum disorder
 
02:47:36.469 --> 02:47:36.479 align:start position:0%
and it also suggested that we take a
 
02:47:38.550 --> 02:47:38.560 align:start position:0%
look at our current waiver structure
 
02:47:41.910 --> 02:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
so once again that stakeholder input
 
02:47:43.670 --> 02:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
impacted the way that we began our
 
02:47:44.950 --> 02:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
dialogue with a
 
02:47:47.429 --> 02:47:47.439 align:start position:0%
m uh in the past two weeks the
 
02:47:49.030 --> 02:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner and i have met
 
02:47:51.269 --> 02:47:51.279 align:start position:0%
with the executive directors of the area
 
02:47:51.279 --> 02:47:52.389 align:start position:0%
with the executive directors of the area
agencies

02:47:52.389 --> 02:47:52.399 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
02:47:54.870 --> 02:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
we've explained some context for the a m
 
02:47:54.880 --> 02:47:55.750 align:start position:0%
we've explained some context for the a m
report

02:47:55.750 --> 02:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
report
 
02:47:58.070 --> 02:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
we have made a commitment to the area
 
02:48:00.070 --> 02:48:00.080 align:start position:0%
agencies that once they've had a chance
 
02:48:01.990 --> 02:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
to dig deeper into the reports that
 
02:48:03.910 --> 02:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
we will circle back and meet with them
 
02:48:05.510 --> 02:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
again but most
 
02:48:09.349 --> 02:48:09.359 align:start position:0%
importantly the recommendation from a m
 
02:48:11.590 --> 02:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
takes into full consideration that this
 
02:48:13.670 --> 02:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
is a significant system change
 
02:48:15.590 --> 02:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
and the ability to listen to all
 
02:48:18.230 --> 02:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
partners relative to this system change
 
02:48:18.870 --> 02:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
is step
 
02:48:21.830 --> 02:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
one and priority one and so the
 
02:48:23.670 --> 02:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
stakeholder engagement process
 
02:48:25.429 --> 02:48:25.439 align:start position:0%
is the first thing out of the gate that
 
02:48:27.110 --> 02:48:27.120 align:start position:0%
we will be considering
 
02:48:29.910 --> 02:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
i think it is very important that it's
 
02:48:31.110 --> 02:48:31.120 align:start position:0%
understood that this
 
02:48:33.910 --> 02:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
engagement includes the potential to
 
02:48:33.920 --> 02:48:34.309 align:start position:0%
engagement includes the potential to
build

02:48:34.309 --> 02:48:34.319 align:start position:0%
build
 
02:48:36.950 --> 02:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
ten four person group homes in
 
02:48:39.110 --> 02:48:39.120 align:start position:0%
cooperation with our system here in new
 
02:48:39.120 --> 02:48:39.990 align:start position:0%
cooperation with our system here in new
hampshire

02:48:39.990 --> 02:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:48:41.670 --> 02:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
so that we keep our new hampshire
 
02:48:43.510 --> 02:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
citizens in new hampshire
 
02:48:45.750 --> 02:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
and get them the support that they need
 
02:48:47.750 --> 02:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
at a reasonable cost
 
02:48:49.269 --> 02:48:49.279 align:start position:0%
and that they are connected to their
 
02:48:51.349 --> 02:48:51.359 align:start position:0%
families and that
 
02:48:53.269 --> 02:48:53.279 align:start position:0%
we are supporting them a hundred percent
 
02:48:55.030 --> 02:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
which is what we need to do as a system
 
02:48:57.349 --> 02:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
here in new
 
02:49:01.510 --> 02:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:02.870 --> 02:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
will you take a question through the
 
02:49:05.510 --> 02:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
sheets absolutely
 
02:49:09.670 --> 02:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
okay so um like three years ago
 
02:49:13.190 --> 02:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
i i was taking a look on a committee
 
02:49:16.309 --> 02:49:16.319 align:start position:0%
to dealing with group home parity
 
02:49:18.150 --> 02:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
and there were different state
 
02:49:19.990 --> 02:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates for different group
 
02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:21.190 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates for different group
homes

02:49:21.190 --> 02:49:21.200 align:start position:0%
homes
 
02:49:24.389 --> 02:49:24.399 align:start position:0%
and as i went on site visits
 
02:49:27.429 --> 02:49:27.439 align:start position:0%
i heard that a huge component of
 
02:49:30.309 --> 02:49:30.319 align:start position:0%
the revenue for every group home are
 
02:49:32.389 --> 02:49:32.399 align:start position:0%
charitable donations
 
02:49:35.429 --> 02:49:35.439 align:start position:0%
and so i'm just curious if we're
 
02:49:35.439 --> 02:49:36.150 align:start position:0%
and so i'm just curious if we're
selecting

02:49:36.150 --> 02:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
selecting
 
02:49:39.750 --> 02:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
four locations for group homes
 
02:49:42.630 --> 02:49:42.640 align:start position:0%
to what extent those group homes will
 
02:49:43.429 --> 02:49:43.439 align:start position:0%
will have a
 
02:49:46.469 --> 02:49:46.479 align:start position:0%
sort of a naturally growing
 
02:49:48.630 --> 02:49:48.640 align:start position:0%
donation base that's necessary to
 
02:49:50.710 --> 02:49:50.720 align:start position:0%
supplement them
 
02:49:52.950 --> 02:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
have you thought about that angle so
 
02:49:54.070 --> 02:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
we're always thinking
 
02:49:56.150 --> 02:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
about private public partnership when it
 
02:49:57.750 --> 02:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
comes to supporting our system
 
02:49:59.670 --> 02:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
one of the benefits of having an area
 
02:50:02.469 --> 02:50:02.479 align:start position:0%
agency system that does heavy lifting
 
02:50:04.309 --> 02:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
is that they do a considerable amount of
 
02:50:06.389 --> 02:50:06.399 align:start position:0%
fundraising to fill gaps
 
02:50:07.670 --> 02:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
and that is something that we will
 
02:50:12.309 --> 02:50:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:15.190 --> 02:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
okay i i i i guess i've just always
 
02:50:17.429 --> 02:50:17.439 align:start position:0%
sensed these group homes to have grown
 
02:50:20.150 --> 02:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
organically in a community and then
 
02:50:23.429 --> 02:50:23.439 align:start position:0%
that that's developed the the
 
02:50:25.990 --> 02:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
sort of the ecosystem of donations for
 
02:50:26.630 --> 02:50:26.640 align:start position:0%
each group
 
02:50:29.190 --> 02:50:29.200 align:start position:0%
group home and i i just am curious if
 
02:50:31.750 --> 02:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
we're doing a top-down
 
02:50:35.030 --> 02:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
group home location process if
 
02:50:36.790 --> 02:50:36.800 align:start position:0%
if we're going to have that organic
 
02:50:39.910 --> 02:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
donation site to supplement it but
 
02:50:42.870 --> 02:50:42.880 align:start position:0%
again as as drew pointed out these are
 
02:50:44.950 --> 02:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
quote unquote grant programs where we
 
02:50:47.429 --> 02:50:47.439 align:start position:0%
will be leveraging local resources to do
 
02:50:48.630 --> 02:50:48.640 align:start position:0%
the builds
 
02:50:50.870 --> 02:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
because in reality it is the local
 
02:50:53.110 --> 02:50:53.120 align:start position:0%
resources that have the connections with
 
02:50:54.790 --> 02:50:54.800 align:start position:0%
the communities to determine where to
 
02:50:56.070 --> 02:50:56.080 align:start position:0%
put a group home
 
02:50:59.269 --> 02:50:59.279 align:start position:0%
how to work with the local um
 
02:51:01.910 --> 02:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
police fire department etc to build a
 
02:51:03.830 --> 02:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
positive approach there so we will be
 
02:51:05.429 --> 02:51:05.439 align:start position:0%
working locally
 
02:51:07.670 --> 02:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
okay it's just if our experience with
 
02:51:09.190 --> 02:51:09.200 align:start position:0%
other group homes
 
02:51:12.389 --> 02:51:12.399 align:start position:0%
uh carries forward the state's not able
 
02:51:12.399 --> 02:51:12.710 align:start position:0%
uh carries forward the state's not able
to

02:51:12.710 --> 02:51:12.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:51:16.150 --> 02:51:16.160 align:start position:0%
fully support them and i i hate to
 
02:51:18.469 --> 02:51:18.479 align:start position:0%
be building infrastructure that may not
 
02:51:19.910 --> 02:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
get supported fully
 
02:51:22.710 --> 02:51:22.720 align:start position:0%
um but all right so that's that's just a
 
02:51:22.720 --> 02:51:23.429 align:start position:0%
um but all right so that's that's just a
concern

02:51:23.429 --> 02:51:23.439 align:start position:0%
concern
 
02:51:26.469 --> 02:51:26.479 align:start position:0%
um are there other questions from the
 
02:51:26.479 --> 02:51:30.070 align:start position:0%
um are there other questions from the
committee

02:51:30.070 --> 02:51:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:33.349 --> 02:51:33.359 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any uh mr smith i i i
 
02:51:35.190 --> 02:51:35.200 align:start position:0%
apologize for cutting you off
 
02:51:37.349 --> 02:51:37.359 align:start position:0%
i'll give you the final word anything
 
02:51:38.630 --> 02:51:38.640 align:start position:0%
you want to tell us well
 
02:51:41.670 --> 02:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
what we're glad to hear
 
02:51:43.349 --> 02:51:43.359 align:start position:0%
no i i thank everybody for the
 
02:51:45.510 --> 02:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity today i i do
 
02:51:46.950 --> 02:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
hope that you have an opportunity to
 
02:51:49.030 --> 02:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
read the full report there there's a lot
 
02:51:52.309 --> 02:51:52.319 align:start position:0%
here our team looked across the entire
 
02:51:54.309 --> 02:51:54.319 align:start position:0%
dhhs system and so there's a lot to
 
02:51:56.309 --> 02:51:56.319 align:start position:0%
digest but it was a great opportunity
 
02:51:58.309 --> 02:51:58.319 align:start position:0%
and we thank you for your time
 
02:52:01.510 --> 02:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
let me let me ask you a parting shot uh
 
02:52:05.030 --> 02:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
it feels to me like these are five
 
02:52:07.349 --> 02:52:07.359 align:start position:0%
independent projects that aren't
 
02:52:07.359 --> 02:52:08.550 align:start position:0%
independent projects that aren't
necessarily

02:52:08.550 --> 02:52:08.560 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
02:52:11.750 --> 02:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
integrated and so in theory
 
02:52:13.990 --> 02:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
one could pick and choose among these
 
02:52:14.000 --> 02:52:14.950 align:start position:0%
one could pick and choose among these
five

02:52:14.950 --> 02:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
five
 
02:52:17.910 --> 02:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
to to create a unique bouquet of
 
02:52:17.920 --> 02:52:19.349 align:start position:0%
to to create a unique bouquet of
solutions

02:52:19.349 --> 02:52:19.359 align:start position:0%
solutions
 
02:52:21.590 --> 02:52:21.600 align:start position:0%
or or must we take all five if we're
 
02:52:26.309 --> 02:52:26.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:28.389 --> 02:52:28.399 align:start position:0%
you know i mean there's probably a quote
 
02:52:29.830 --> 02:52:29.840 align:start position:0%
here around the only thing that you must
 
02:52:30.870 --> 02:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
do in this world is
 
02:52:33.190 --> 02:52:33.200 align:start position:0%
pay taxes and die but i i mean i think
 
02:52:34.870 --> 02:52:34.880 align:start position:0%
this is this isn't meant to always be a
 
02:52:35.590 --> 02:52:35.600 align:start position:0%
menu right
 
02:52:38.790 --> 02:52:38.800 align:start position:0%
uh you know the hhs program and i'll
 
02:52:40.710 --> 02:52:40.720 align:start position:0%
just speak from our experience in new
 
02:52:43.030 --> 02:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire as well as other states
 
02:52:46.469 --> 02:52:46.479 align:start position:0%
these populations are unique and the
 
02:52:47.990 --> 02:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
projects that have been outlined here
 
02:52:50.230 --> 02:52:50.240 align:start position:0%
are unique to those populations
 
02:52:52.230 --> 02:52:52.240 align:start position:0%
um you know i don't think we want to put
 
02:52:53.830 --> 02:52:53.840 align:start position:0%
the state in the decision point of
 
02:52:56.230 --> 02:52:56.240 align:start position:0%
picking one group over the other
 
02:52:57.830 --> 02:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
we pulled these programs out because we
 
02:52:59.429 --> 02:52:59.439 align:start position:0%
think that these recommendations are
 
02:53:00.950 --> 02:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
timely we think that they will have a
 
02:53:02.469 --> 02:53:02.479 align:start position:0%
substantive change
 
02:53:04.150 --> 02:53:04.160 align:start position:0%
on the way that individuals are served
 
02:53:05.910 --> 02:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
within the state of new hampshire
 
02:53:07.590 --> 02:53:07.600 align:start position:0%
i don't view this as a menu i view this
 
02:53:09.269 --> 02:53:09.279 align:start position:0%
as an opportunity for the state to
 
02:53:11.110 --> 02:53:11.120 align:start position:0%
really build these programs back up
 
02:53:13.110 --> 02:53:13.120 align:start position:0%
and really make this commitment to the
 
02:53:14.469 --> 02:53:14.479 align:start position:0%
supports that are offered individuals
 
02:53:18.389 --> 02:53:18.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:20.150 --> 02:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
look like you may want to have a comment
 
02:53:21.750 --> 02:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
there are these
 
02:53:23.990 --> 02:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
are these integrated or there's are they
 
02:53:24.000 --> 02:53:29.030 align:start position:0%
are these integrated or there's are they
separable

02:53:29.030 --> 02:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:32.870 --> 02:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
is she frozen are you asking me so cti
 
02:53:35.910 --> 02:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
and i would say cti cmhc and the imd
 
02:53:35.920 --> 02:53:36.710 align:start position:0%
and i would say cti cmhc and the imd
waiver

02:53:36.710 --> 02:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
waiver
 
02:53:39.510 --> 02:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
are all very integrated they're all the
 
02:53:40.790 --> 02:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
mental health system
 
02:53:42.550 --> 02:53:42.560 align:start position:0%
so they're they're all very integrated
 
02:53:44.309 --> 02:53:44.319 align:start position:0%
but to drew's point
 
02:53:45.830 --> 02:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
you're essentially talking about three
 
02:53:47.910 --> 02:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
different populations here
 
02:53:51.030 --> 02:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
i i i heard mr smith's point i i get it
 
02:53:53.190 --> 02:53:53.200 align:start position:0%
but i do want to be able to understand
 
02:53:54.950 --> 02:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
it from a different angle so what three
 
02:53:57.349 --> 02:53:57.359 align:start position:0%
did you say were definitely integrated
 
02:54:04.630 --> 02:54:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:06.790 --> 02:54:06.800 align:start position:0%
all right and don't don't take my
 
02:54:08.710 --> 02:54:08.720 align:start position:0%
question or comment to mean anything
 
02:54:09.750 --> 02:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
other than i'm just
 
02:54:13.349 --> 02:54:13.359 align:start position:0%
trying to understand all right uh
 
02:54:16.630 --> 02:54:16.640 align:start position:0%
at this point it's 12 24. uh i think
 
02:54:20.070 --> 02:54:20.080 align:start position:0%
we can uh break for uh lunch
 
02:54:22.230 --> 02:54:22.240 align:start position:0%
and because we still have a really busy
 
02:54:24.070 --> 02:54:24.080 align:start position:0%
agenda i'd like to start
 
02:54:28.150 --> 02:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
at one and and uh my proposal is ms
 
02:54:28.160 --> 02:54:28.710 align:start position:0%
at one and and uh my proposal is ms
rounds

02:54:28.710 --> 02:54:28.720 align:start position:0%
rounds
 
02:54:30.790 --> 02:54:30.800 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll give you the first bite at
 
02:54:32.630 --> 02:54:32.640 align:start position:0%
the apple you know you got
 
02:54:35.190 --> 02:54:35.200 align:start position:0%
like five things we want to talk about
 
02:54:35.910 --> 02:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:54:38.230 --> 02:54:38.240 align:start position:0%
i'll just let you start talking and
 
02:54:39.590 --> 02:54:39.600 align:start position:0%
knocking them out
 
02:54:41.590 --> 02:54:41.600 align:start position:0%
i just would ask that if you if we've
 
02:54:42.950 --> 02:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
got something we can look at
 
02:54:45.190 --> 02:54:45.200 align:start position:0%
at the screen that we we have a visual
 
02:54:46.950 --> 02:54:46.960 align:start position:0%
to go with what you're talking about
 
02:54:49.750 --> 02:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
is possible i will do my best to do that
 
02:54:50.150 --> 02:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
and i
 
02:54:52.710 --> 02:54:52.720 align:start position:0%
i do appreciate that thank you all right
 
02:54:54.150 --> 02:54:54.160 align:start position:0%
no we just appreciate
 
02:54:56.150 --> 02:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
uh your your being here and your
 
02:54:57.429 --> 02:54:57.439 align:start position:0%
responsiveness and
 
02:54:59.269 --> 02:54:59.279 align:start position:0%

and i see that this wondrous seller has
 
02:55:04.240 --> 02:55:05.349 align:start position:0%
and i see that this wondrous seller has
been

02:55:05.349 --> 02:55:05.359 align:start position:0%
been
 
02:55:08.389 --> 02:55:08.399 align:start position:0%
on the panel pretty much a lot of the
 
02:55:08.399 --> 02:55:09.110 align:start position:0%
on the panel pretty much a lot of the
time

02:55:09.110 --> 02:55:09.120 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:55:13.910 --> 02:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:17.349 --> 02:55:17.359 align:start position:0%
so wanda is the lead with brendan on
 
02:55:18.309 --> 02:55:18.319 align:start position:0%
this project
 
02:55:20.950 --> 02:55:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh wanda also ran the developmental
 
02:55:22.070 --> 02:55:22.080 align:start position:0%
disability system
 
02:55:23.750 --> 02:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
in the state of south dakota for many
 
02:55:25.830 --> 02:55:25.840 align:start position:0%
many years so she's an expert
 
02:55:29.190 --> 02:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
in that area as well oh well i'm from
 
02:55:31.670 --> 02:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
nebraska go big red
 
02:55:34.630 --> 02:55:34.640 align:start position:0%
so all right um but i don't think she
 
02:55:37.269 --> 02:55:37.279 align:start position:0%
has anything to say
 
02:55:39.429 --> 02:55:39.439 align:start position:0%

appreciate the time um that you provided
 
02:55:53.510 --> 02:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
um our team to present on these really
 
02:55:54.630 --> 02:55:54.640 align:start position:0%
important issues
 
02:55:57.670 --> 02:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
thank you my pleasure and i think i do
 
02:55:59.590 --> 02:55:59.600 align:start position:0%
appreciate the spoon feeding it's
 
02:56:01.510 --> 02:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
it's great to have experts who will just
 
02:56:03.750 --> 02:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
answer questions the way you have so
 
02:56:06.469 --> 02:56:06.479 align:start position:0%
so we'll see you all at one o'clock if
 
02:56:07.750 --> 02:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
you could stop recording
 
02:56:10.790 --> 02:56:10.800 align:start position:0%
mr ripple and put us on recess with the
