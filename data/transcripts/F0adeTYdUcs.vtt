a few minutes here and talk about
 
00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 align:start position:0%
uh who we are as a commission and what
 
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
we do so that everyone
 
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 align:start position:0%
uh so that we're all on the same page
 
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.030 align:start position:0%
uh so that we're all on the same page
here

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
just by way of a little history the
 
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
human rights commission was established
 
00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 align:start position:0%
in 1965
 
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 align:start position:0%
by rsa 354-a for the purpose of
 
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.429 align:start position:0%
by rsa 354-a for the purpose of
eliminating

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 align:start position:0%
eliminating
 
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
discrimination in the areas of
 
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
employment housing
 
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 align:start position:0%
public accommodation and in education
 
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 align:start position:0%
more recently
 
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 align:start position:0%
the commission is comprised of seven
 
00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 align:start position:0%
volunteer commissioners
 
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 align:start position:0%
who provide oversight and make decisions
 
00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 align:start position:0%
on charges of discrimination
 
00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 align:start position:0%
each commissioner is appointed by the
 
00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 align:start position:0%
governor with the consent of the
 
00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 align:start position:0%
executive council
 
00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 align:start position:0%
for a term of five years unless someone
 
00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 align:start position:0%
is filling in for someone else's term
 
00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 align:start position:0%
and they complete that term and then
 
00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 align:start position:0%
there would be a renomination should
 
00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
that person decide to
 
00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 align:start position:0%
continue on with the commission in a
 
00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
nutshell what we do
 
00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 align:start position:0%
is the commission has the power to
 
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
receive investigate and
 
00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
pass upon complaints of illegal
 
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.550 align:start position:0%
pass upon complaints of illegal
discrimination

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
and to engage in research education and
 
00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 align:start position:0%
community outreach
 
00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
so designated to prevent discrimination
 
00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 align:start position:0%
as it states in our statute in addition
 
00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 align:start position:0%
to the authority vested in the
 
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
commission by rsa 354-a
 
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 align:start position:0%
to enforce new hampshire's laws against
 
00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 align:start position:0%
discrimination the commission also
 
00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
partners with the u.s
 
00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
equal employment opportunity commission
 
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 align:start position:0%
also known as the eeoc
 
00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 align:start position:0%
to enforce federal laws prohibiting
 
00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
discrimination and employment
 
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
as well and we have a small office of
 
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
we may be at nine right now um so we're
 
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
certainly here to discuss that
 
00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 align:start position:0%
a little bit of information and um
 
00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 align:start position:0%
one of the things that a couple of
 
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 align:start position:0%
things that we are looking for
 
00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 align:start position:0%
in this new budget that are listed as
 
00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
our prioritized needs
 
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 align:start position:0%
is to reinstitute the funding for our
 
00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
administrative assistant
 
00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:12.159 align:start position:0%
um to re
 
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 align:start position:0%
well to reinstitute funding for one
 
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 align:start position:0%
other part-time position and that would
 
00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
become an
 
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
intake coordinator that helps us
 
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 align:start position:0%
in bringing in and doing just the
 
00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.750 align:start position:0%
in bringing in and doing just the
initial

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
initial
 
00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:25.599 align:start position:0%
we could say investigation but the
 
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
initial conversation with someone who is
 
00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
potentially filing a charge of
 
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.190 align:start position:0%
potentially filing a charge of
investigation

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 align:start position:0%
funds for our doit shared costs and
 
00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
on the way on the wish list would be the
 
00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
adding of a brand new position
 
00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
which would be a person that would be
 
00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.869 align:start position:0%
which would be a person that would be
responsible

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:42.879 align:start position:0%
responsible
 
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
for our for creating and administering
 
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:46.070 align:start position:0%
for our for creating and administering
our

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 align:start position:0%
training program which we are able to
 
00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:49.990 align:start position:0%
training program which we are able to
charge

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
charge
 
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 align:start position:0%
fees for and able to bring monies in
 
00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 align:start position:0%
that go back into the general fund so
 
00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 align:start position:0%
with that i've include
 
00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:00.159 align:start position:0%
i conclude my initial testimony i do
 
00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 align:start position:0%
have the
 
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
answers to the questions that you posed
 
00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 align:start position:0%
and i
 
00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:07.599 align:start position:0%
am ready to move through that as uh as
 
00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
as you all would like thank you i think
 
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
i think you covered the first three
 
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 align:start position:0%
questions you don't have any new full
 
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
staff and two positions were unfunded so
 
00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
you did that very nicely in your initial
 
00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:22.479 align:start position:0%
um and you gave us a description of what
 
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
they do
 
00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:25.199 align:start position:0%
including the part-time intake
 
00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:26.950 align:start position:0%
including the part-time intake
coordinator

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
coordinator
 
00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
i did question 7b
 
00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:46.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 align:start position:0%
um usually what doit will do for us
 
00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
is to assist
 
00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
the commission with a variety of items
 
00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 align:start position:0%
that we
 
00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
should um either update or or make
 
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
changes on
 
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 align:start position:0%
as um as time goes on
 
00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
and what they have for us in our
 
00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:14.479 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs um at the
 
00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
majority of it is just our to fund our
 
00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
shared costs
 
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
for doit so there wasn't anything
 
00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
all right so your budget starts on page
 
00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.710 align:start position:0%
all right so your budget starts on page
322

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
322
 
00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 align:start position:0%
goes to the end of 323 and basically as
 
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 align:start position:0%
you testified
 
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:38.720 align:start position:0%
you're using slightly fewer general fund
 
00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 align:start position:0%
dollars because you have unfunded
 
00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.830 align:start position:0%
dollars because you have unfunded
positions

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 align:start position:0%
positions
 
00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
and you did that to meet the
 
00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:46.639 align:start position:0%
requirements basically of the pandemic
 
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
that the governor had to
 
00:05:51.749 --> 00:05:51.759 align:start position:0%
respond to questions of the
 
00:05:57.749 --> 00:05:57.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 align:start position:0%

i have several questions actually um i
 
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:04.390 align:start position:0%
i have several questions actually um i
ask

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
ask
 
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
so what percentage your money is general
 
00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.080 align:start position:0%
funds and what how much of a general
 
00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:11.039 align:start position:0%
fund cut did you have to take
 
00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:14.800 align:start position:0%
so um our the percentage we are
 
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
about 85 percent general funds and so
 
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
the balance of that is
 
00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.440 align:start position:0%
um helped with our contract with the
 
00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:24.560 align:start position:0%
eeoc so roughly 15
 
00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:27.199 align:start position:0%
and um you know i don't have the
 
00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
specific percentage
 
00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
uh relative to the quote-unquote
 
00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
cuts i mean we just we just didn't hire
 
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
a couple of people back so we didn't
 
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
certainly have to let anyone go
 
00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
which at the very least is good
 
00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
uh that was another question i went
 
00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
ahead so thank you oh okay
 
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
if we were to level fund you how much
 
00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:54.479 align:start position:0%
so i would if you look mary beth at the
 
00:06:57.189 --> 00:06:57.199 align:start position:0%
bottom of page 323
 
00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
forty 813 dollars in fiscal 2021 which
 
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:06.560 align:start position:0%
we're in
 
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
in 2022
 
00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
she's at 765 and 157
 
00:07:17.749 --> 00:07:17.759 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars or but in
 
00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
2023 she goes back up slightly above the
 
00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:23.360 align:start position:0%
adjusted authorized for 2021.
 
00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
you see that at the bottom of page 323
 
00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
in your general funds
 
00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:37.589 --> 00:07:37.599 align:start position:0%
all right i'll come back to that and i
 
00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
have one more question while i have the
 
00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:40.070 align:start position:0%
have one more question while i have the
floor

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
floor
 
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
um and that is in your answers to your
 
00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
questions you say that we should
 
00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
um eliminate let me find the exact
 
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:48.550 align:start position:0%
um eliminate let me find the exact
wording

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:48.560 align:start position:0%
wording
 
00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.830 align:start position:0%
wording
um

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:53.749 --> 00:07:53.759 align:start position:0%
so i thought that we should suspend some
 
00:07:55.749 --> 00:07:55.759 align:start position:0%
things because we're not funding it am i
 
00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
misreading that am i quick read here
 
00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
um on i think you're referring to thank
 
00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:01.280 align:start position:0%
you for the question
 
00:08:03.749 --> 00:08:03.759 align:start position:0%
uh representative walsh um i believe
 
00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
you're referring to question number five
 
00:08:08.629 --> 00:08:08.639 align:start position:0%
which was in response to it was the next
 
00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
part of four
 
00:08:12.469 --> 00:08:12.479 align:start position:0%
there i i'm not suggesting that any laws
 
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
should be suspended i think
 
00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
the only thing uh one of the things in
 
00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
our statute is relative to the time
 
00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:19.430 align:start position:0%
our statute is relative to the time
frame

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
frame
 
00:08:23.589 --> 00:08:23.599 align:start position:0%
uh for us and um i would
 
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
potentially think that's what you're
 
00:08:27.589 --> 00:08:27.599 align:start position:0%
specifically referring to or what the
 
00:08:28.469 --> 00:08:28.479 align:start position:0%
question is
 
00:08:31.029 --> 00:08:31.039 align:start position:0%
is referring to um i don't think any
 
00:08:33.269 --> 00:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
laws should be suspended
 
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
well that was it if just if anything
 
00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
needed to be suspended my question was
 
00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:37.670 align:start position:0%
needed to be suspended my question was
what

00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:08:40.469 --> 00:08:40.479 align:start position:0%
that's all oh uh no i don't think so
 
00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for the follow-up and the
 
00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:42.709 align:start position:0%
thank you for the follow-up and the
clarification

00:08:42.709 --> 00:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
um no i don't believe anything should be
 
00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.070 align:start position:0%
um no i don't believe anything should be
suspended

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
suspended
 
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
thank you uh that's my questions madam
 
00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.590 align:start position:0%
thank you uh that's my questions madam

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
representative thank you madam chairman
 
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for your presentation just a
 
00:08:56.949 --> 00:08:56.959 align:start position:0%
quick question
 
00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
on the bottom of page 323 under
 
00:09:01.829 --> 00:09:01.839 align:start position:0%
estimated source of funds for
 
00:09:01.839 --> 00:09:03.670 align:start position:0%
estimated source of funds for
enforcement

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
009 agency income
 
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:08.800 align:start position:0%
could you clarify on that as to you're
 
00:09:09.829 --> 00:09:09.839 align:start position:0%
not getting any more
 
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
income and what type of income that was
 
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
please certainly um
 
00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
the income that we generate it's it's
 
00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
two things
 
00:09:18.949 --> 00:09:18.959 align:start position:0%
um it's so i'm not including federal
 
00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:20.240 align:start position:0%
funds um
 
00:09:23.269 --> 00:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
what what that line specifically speaks
 
00:09:23.279 --> 00:09:23.590 align:start position:0%
what what that line specifically speaks
to

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:09:26.389 --> 00:09:26.399 align:start position:0%
is training that we provide and when we
 
00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:26.870 align:start position:0%
is training that we provide and when we
provide

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
provide
 
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
training we do um get paid for that
 
00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:30.550 align:start position:0%
training we do um get paid for that
training

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
training
 
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
and um the other source of income is if
 
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
people are in need of duplicate copies
 
00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:37.590 align:start position:0%
people are in need of duplicate copies
of

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
of their files for any reason we provide
 
00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
no cost up to a certain number of pages
 
00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
and then after that
 
00:09:48.389 --> 00:09:48.399 align:start position:0%
there is an administrative fee and a fee
 
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:49.360 align:start position:0%
per page for the
 
00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
for the duplication and um
 
00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
and then there would be you know money
 
00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
paid to uh paid to the commission but
 
00:09:58.949 --> 00:09:58.959 align:start position:0%
certainly when it's deposited all of
 
00:10:02.829 --> 00:10:02.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up sorry thank you for that
 
00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
um uh you mentioned uh training
 
00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
uh and there's no funds for training
 
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
given the importance of your department
 
00:10:15.829 --> 00:10:15.839 align:start position:0%
why haven't you allocated funds for
 
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
training in the future
 
00:10:20.069 --> 00:10:20.079 align:start position:0%
oh i apologize um and thank you for the
 
00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:21.680 align:start position:0%
question and for the follow-up
 
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
um the the zeroes there are the income
 
00:10:28.389 --> 00:10:28.399 align:start position:0%
so it's stating it what that's showing
 
00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
going to do x number of training so it's
 
00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:36.949 align:start position:0%
going to do x number of training so it's
not

00:10:36.949 --> 00:10:36.959 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
training for the for us it's training
 
00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
that we provide
 
00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
if any agency uh any businesses contact
 
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
us for training
 
00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:48.240 align:start position:0%
we certainly will make training
 
00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.350 align:start position:0%
we certainly will make training
available

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
and sometimes it is a part of
 
00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
a mediation or it could be a part of
 
00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
the the closing of a case
 
00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
that a business or an individual may
 
00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:03.590 align:start position:0%
that a business or an individual may
need

00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
need
 
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
um a variety of trainings i mean
 
00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:08.240 align:start position:0%
the majority of what we provide is
 
00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
sexual harassment training
 
00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
and so with that being said if we're
 
00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
if someone reaches out to us and
 
00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
requires training we will absolutely
 
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
provide that and then that will come
 
00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
that the finances for that
 
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
or the pay for that will come in however
 
00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
we're not actively attaching
 
00:11:31.269 --> 00:11:31.279 align:start position:0%
a dollar amount that we're going to do x
 
00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
number of trainings
 
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
which is why that line is at zero did i
 
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
answer your question
 
00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
