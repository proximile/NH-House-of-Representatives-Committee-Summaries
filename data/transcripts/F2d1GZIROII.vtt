00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:12.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:14.940 align:start position:0%
White my question really is could you
 
00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:16.140 align:start position:0%
just give us
 
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
a little more in-depth explanation of
 
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
what this is all about thank you
 
00:10:23.269 --> 00:10:23.279 align:start position:0%
of course uh good morning Nathan white
 
00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:24.540 align:start position:0%
Chief Financial Officer with the
 
00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:26.820 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:28.680 align:start position:0%
um this uh to representative Earth's
 
00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:30.660 align:start position:0%
point this item is certainly a little
 
00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:32.220 align:start position:0%
unique I don't think this has happened
 
00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:34.440 align:start position:0%
certainly in recent memory
 
00:10:36.829 --> 00:10:36.839 align:start position:0%
what we're doing here there there's two
 
00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:39.240 align:start position:0%
key purposes behind this item um the
 
00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:41.580 align:start position:0%
first is to establish a new accounting
 
00:10:44.389 --> 00:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
unit uh to ensure that the the dish
 
00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:47.700 align:start position:0%
recruitments and red distributions are
 
00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
done in a transparent way so that's one
 
00:10:51.769 --> 00:10:51.779 align:start position:0%
action within this item the other key
 
00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:53.820 align:start position:0%
component of this is authority to accept
 
00:10:57.889 --> 00:10:57.899 align:start position:0%
and expend those redistributions and so
 
00:10:59.810 --> 00:10:59.820 align:start position:0%
the department contracts with an
 
00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:02.820 align:start position:0%
independent third-party auditor that
 
00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
looks at the dis at the dish
 
00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.250 align:start position:0%
looks at the dis at the dish
distributions

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:06.260 align:start position:0%
distributions
 
00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
and we've been working with with that
 
00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:12.300 align:start position:0%
auditor and this accounting unit would
 
00:11:14.449 --> 00:11:14.459 align:start position:0%
allow us to collect the funds and reduce
 
00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:16.680 align:start position:0%
from certain hospitals and redistribute
 
00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:19.380 align:start position:0%
to other hospitals we have not been able
 
00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:21.300 align:start position:0%
to do this because of ongoing federal
 
00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:24.420 align:start position:0%
and state litigation for some time and
 
00:11:26.329 --> 00:11:26.339 align:start position:0%
the amounts that you see represented
 
00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:29.700 align:start position:0%
here these are the audits from 2011
 
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
through 2017.
 
00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:36.420 align:start position:0%
um the 2018 and 2000 19 audits are still
 
00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:39.420 align:start position:0%
currently underway and being finalized
 
00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:41.700 align:start position:0%
and you typically see about a three-year
 
00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:44.220 align:start position:0%
delay with the audit process due to a
 
00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
variety of procedures the audits are
 
00:11:48.829 --> 00:11:48.839 align:start position:0%
done again by a third party to come up
 
00:11:50.329 --> 00:11:50.339 align:start position:0%
with those determinations and they're
 
00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:54.060 align:start position:0%
done in accordance with CMS regulations
 
00:11:56.389 --> 00:11:56.399 align:start position:0%
um and I will stop there for further
 
00:11:56.399 --> 00:11:59.870 align:start position:0%
um and I will stop there for further
questions

00:11:59.870 --> 00:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
so it's basically moving money
 
00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:03.060 align:start position:0%
essentially from One hospital to another
 
00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:06.180 align:start position:0%
hospital is that kind of what's going on
 
00:12:08.509 --> 00:12:08.519 align:start position:0%
that is correct so it's the Auditors
 
00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
looked at the distribution amounts that
 
00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:13.200 align:start position:0%
were made to each of the hospitals and
 
00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:14.940 align:start position:0%
um through that process determinations
 
00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:16.620 align:start position:0%
have been made that funds need to be
 
00:12:19.069 --> 00:12:19.079 align:start position:0%
redistributed uh to the other hospitals
 
00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:20.640 align:start position:0%
some were overpaid somewhere underpaid
 
00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:24.660 align:start position:0%
uh based on based on the criteria I know
 
00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
that there was a question that came in
 
00:12:29.449 --> 00:12:29.459 align:start position:0%
relative to whether we could identify
 
00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:31.380 align:start position:0%
the specific amounts that went from
 
00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:33.720 align:start position:0%
which hospital to the other hospital I'm
 
00:12:35.389 --> 00:12:35.399 align:start position:0%
still waiting to hear back from legal on
 
00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
a final determination relative to what
 
00:12:38.569 --> 00:12:38.579 align:start position:0%
would be considered proprietary
 
00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:40.620 align:start position:0%
financial information and what could be
 
00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
shared publicly essentially what would
 
00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:44.100 align:start position:0%
be subject to right to know
 
00:12:45.769 --> 00:12:45.779 align:start position:0%
so essentially there's no new money here
 
00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
this is basically as redistributing
 
00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:49.980 align:start position:0%
those funds those federal funds
 
00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
precisely this is a net zero impact but
 
00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:54.240 align:start position:0%
we just need the authority to accept
 
00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:56.220 align:start position:0%
those dollars and and to pay those
 
00:12:58.069 --> 00:12:58.079 align:start position:0%
dollars out thank you very much of
 
00:12:58.079 --> 00:12:59.329 align:start position:0%
dollars out thank you very much of
course

00:12:59.329 --> 00:12:59.339 align:start position:0%
course
 
00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosenwald for a question
 
00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:04.860 align:start position:0%
good morning Nathan so are we going to
 
00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:06.670 align:start position:0%
good morning Nathan so are we going to
be

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:06.680 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:13:11.509 --> 00:13:11.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
what we were doing prior to the dish
 
00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:16.860 align:start position:0%
settlement or are we going to be
 
00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:18.590 align:start position:0%
settlement or are we going to be
redistributing

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
redistributing
 
00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
in accordance with the dish settlement
 
00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
so it was a very complicated history
 
00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:29.100 align:start position:0%
here behind all of this and excellent
 
00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
and Meredith Toulouse has lived and
 
00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:34.200 align:start position:0%
experienced this entire history and
 
00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:35.940 align:start position:0%
she's here to dive right into the
 
00:13:42.829 --> 00:13:42.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:44.509 --> 00:13:44.519 align:start position:0%
I didn't I didn't actually have to live
 
00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:46.260 align:start position:0%
through the whole history but I've been
 
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
here for part of it and I can tell you
 
00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
that what we have done is
 
00:13:51.829 --> 00:13:51.839 align:start position:0%
each year we've made payments in
 
00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:53.940 align:start position:0%
accordance with the settlements
 
00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:56.180 align:start position:0%
but those payments are still based on
 
00:13:58.250 --> 00:13:58.260 align:start position:0%
interim data
 
00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
so every year there's a every year that
 
00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:02.940 align:start position:0%
we've made a payment there's been a
 
00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:04.740 align:start position:0%
subsequent dish audit
 
00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
and so these redistributions are to come
 
00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:10.200 align:start position:0%
into compliance with the amounts of
 
00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:12.300 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care based on that audited
 
00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:16.490 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care based on that audited
amount

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:16.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.009 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:14:18.009 --> 00:14:18.019 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:21.420 align:start position:0%
Senator dallasandro so it's a true up
 
00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:24.060 align:start position:0%
it's a true up exactly yes we make the
 
00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
payments in the year based on the
 
00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:27.420 align:start position:0%
settlement that's in place at the time
 
00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
and then we have to True up based on the
 
00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
actual amounts once the audit is
 
00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:34.260 align:start position:0%
complete it's nice to see you Meredith
 
00:14:37.069 --> 00:14:37.079 align:start position:0%
very nice to see you Senator thank you
 
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
I guess the questions arose we've never
 
00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
seen on this on the agenda before
 
00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:43.860 align:start position:0%
correct this is the first time we're
 
00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:45.720 align:start position:0%
doing a redistribution
 
00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:47.940 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:50.810 align:start position:0%
thank you
and

00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:50.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:53.820 align:start position:0%
okay motion to approve the item
 
00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:55.009 align:start position:0%
okay motion to approve the item
by

00:14:55.009 --> 00:14:55.019 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:14:57.370 --> 00:14:57.380 align:start position:0%
Senator gray second by Senator Bradley

no we haven't we haven't no he wasn't
 
00:15:09.829 --> 00:15:09.839 align:start position:0%
can ask a question on this one
 
00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:11.820 align:start position:0%
you have a question on this this item
 
00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:15.300 align:start position:0%
yeah go ahead I can't find my note I did
 
00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:17.100 align:start position:0%
I did think I had a question but go
 
00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:19.260 align:start position:0%
ahead all right
 
00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:22.680 align:start position:0%
all in favor say aye aye opposed no now
 
00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:25.500 align:start position:0%
we'll go to the item that I that Senator
 
00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:28.980 align:start position:0%
Edwards had removed in tab three
 
00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:31.220 align:start position:0%
and that was
 
00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:34.860 align:start position:0%
144. 144. it's again Health and Human
 
00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:46.670 align:start position:0%
144. 144. it's again Health and Human
Services

00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:48.949 --> 00:15:48.959 align:start position:0%
Senator Edwards is recognized for a
 
00:15:48.959 --> 00:15:51.230 align:start position:0%
Senator Edwards is recognized for a
question

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:53.449 --> 00:15:53.459 align:start position:0%
a representative Edwards uh thank you I
 
00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
was a little reluctant to speak up there
 
00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:00.660 align:start position:0%
but uh I um thank you Mr chair the uh
 
00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:03.540 align:start position:0%
the school children of uh of Auburn
 
00:16:05.569 --> 00:16:05.579 align:start position:0%
Village School say hello and send their
 
00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:08.220 align:start position:0%
warm greetings uh thank you for allowing
 
00:16:11.629 --> 00:16:11.639 align:start position:0%
me to be a little bit late to this
 
00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:15.420 align:start position:0%
um I I understand and support what we're
 
00:16:18.949 --> 00:16:18.959 align:start position:0%
trying to do with the with this item
 
00:16:21.069 --> 00:16:21.079 align:start position:0%
um uh the
 
00:16:25.009 --> 00:16:25.019 align:start position:0%
1.125 million uh is is uh is good to
 
00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
build out the system of care what I
 
00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:31.380 align:start position:0%
think we need to start knowing though is
 
00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:35.220 align:start position:0%
when these kinds of transfers or or or
 
00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:39.060 align:start position:0%
or new expenditures have an impact or
 
00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
are perceived to potentially have an
 
00:16:46.189 --> 00:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
impact on the ER boarding crisis
 
00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:48.420 align:start position:0%
um I I'd like to know it I mean in
 
00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:50.820 align:start position:0%
theory every time we improve the system
 
00:16:54.889 --> 00:16:54.899 align:start position:0%
of care I think we can assume that
 
00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:56.940 align:start position:0%
there's some inter if you know maybe
 
00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:01.740 align:start position:0%
indirect uh benefit to eliminating the
 
00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:04.740 align:start position:0%
ER boarding problem but what I would
 
00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:08.220 align:start position:0%
appreciate is if we could get as much as
 
00:17:11.169 --> 00:17:11.179 align:start position:0%
you can sort of a direct connection
 
00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:14.579 align:start position:0%
between the new spend and the reduction
 
00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:17.220 align:start position:0%
in that the number of people being
 
00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
boarded and and I'm I'm I'm thinking
 
00:17:22.789 --> 00:17:22.799 align:start position:0%
that that's particularly ripe and
 
00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:24.660 align:start position:0%
important for us
 
00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:27.540 align:start position:0%
because of the court order to say we
 
00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
have to fix this in a year right and so
 
00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:33.540 align:start position:0%
we need to know where we're at and what
 
00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:35.100 align:start position:0%
we're doing and what the potential
 
00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
impact may be to be able to help you so
 
00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
so so today on this particular item are
 
00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:46.200 align:start position:0%
you able to say anything that you're
 
00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:49.500 align:start position:0%
confident in in terms of projecting a
 
00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:52.260 align:start position:0%
more direct impact on the ER boarding
 
00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.010 align:start position:0%
more direct impact on the ER boarding
problem

00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:54.020 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:55.860 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:17:58.490 --> 00:17:58.500 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Edwards Marissa
 
00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:02.940 align:start position:0%
hen associate commissioner at DHHS and
 
00:18:04.669 --> 00:18:04.679 align:start position:0%
um welcome the opportunity to reflect on
 
00:18:06.289 --> 00:18:06.299 align:start position:0%
that for a moment
 
00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:08.100 align:start position:0%
um you know first I think this item
 
00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
which is dealing with our children's
 
00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:13.740 align:start position:0%
system of care so looking at getting
 
00:18:16.789 --> 00:18:16.799 align:start position:0%
kids into the right level of care to
 
00:18:18.409 --> 00:18:18.419 align:start position:0%
meet their behavioral health needs
 
00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
whether those are able to be served in
 
00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:22.440 align:start position:0%
the community or require a more
 
00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
intensive level of treatment in a
 
00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:26.820 align:start position:0%
residential setting or perhaps even in
 
00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:29.580 align:start position:0%
an acute psychiatric setting that's what
 
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
the department is focused on as a whole
 
00:18:35.029 --> 00:18:35.039 align:start position:0%
and so I think here when we recognized
 
00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
um when the when the residential system
 
00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:39.780 align:start position:0%
was launched in 2021 we didn't know
 
00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:41.640 align:start position:0%
exactly what the level of need would be
 
00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:43.980 align:start position:0%
we didn't know through those contracts
 
00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:46.140 align:start position:0%
whether we would have enough beds at the
 
00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
varying levels of the Continuum and so
 
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
what this item does is allows us to
 
00:18:54.049 --> 00:18:54.059 align:start position:0%
um to transfer funds not in any way to
 
00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:55.620 align:start position:0%
the harm of another program but to
 
00:18:58.190 --> 00:18:58.200 align:start position:0%
transfer for funds to help provide that
 
00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
level of care for kids who need it
 
00:19:02.049 --> 00:19:02.059 align:start position:0%
within our residential treatment system
 
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
at the same time I do want to note that
 
00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:07.460 align:start position:0%
it doesn't in no way harm any of the
 
00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:10.020 align:start position:0%
transitional housing type settings from
 
00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:11.100 align:start position:0%
which the month the funds are
 
00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:12.720 align:start position:0%
transferred those will continue those
 
00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:14.580 align:start position:0%
those housing bridge and other vouchers
 
00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:17.160 align:start position:0%
will continue this just allows us to put
 
00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:19.980 align:start position:0%
funds where we need them right now to
 
00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:22.740 align:start position:0%
the question of boarding getting people
 
00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:25.620 align:start position:0%
to the level of care that they need is
 
00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:28.740 align:start position:0%
part of the whole prevention of
 
00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:30.900 align:start position:0%
emergency department boarding so when we
 
00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
can serve people's needs ideally in the
 
00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:34.390 align:start position:0%
can serve people's needs ideally in the
community

00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
in through working with schools working
 
00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:38.700 align:start position:0%
with families working with Community
 
00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:41.220 align:start position:0%
providers that's the best level of
 
00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:42.900 align:start position:0%
prevention but we know that at times
 
00:19:45.529 --> 00:19:45.539 align:start position:0%
people do have episodes whether it's in
 
00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:49.260 align:start position:0%
the context of a crisis or a um or or a
 
00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
situation escalating for another reason
 
00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:53.100 align:start position:0%
where they need that more intensive care
 
00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:55.380 align:start position:0%
ideally we want to avoid having to go
 
00:19:57.289 --> 00:19:57.299 align:start position:0%
through the emergency department at all
 
00:19:59.570 --> 00:19:59.580 align:start position:0%
the emergency department is not the
 
00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
ideal place to be managing those
 
00:20:03.409 --> 00:20:03.419 align:start position:0%
conditions and that is what this will
 
00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:05.900 align:start position:0%
allow us to do in part is to continue
 
00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:08.700 align:start position:0%
identifying screening in a standardized
 
00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:10.620 align:start position:0%
way those youth but really we're doing
 
00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
it for the population as a whole who who
 
00:20:15.169 --> 00:20:15.179 align:start position:0%
may require care in a therapeutically
 
00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:17.460 align:start position:0%
appropriate setting other than the
 
00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:19.860 align:start position:0%
emergency department I'll just note um
 
00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:21.900 align:start position:0%
finally and what's you know welcome any
 
00:20:24.049 --> 00:20:24.059 align:start position:0%
follow-up questions uh
 
00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
we just about 15 minutes ago announced
 
00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:27.720 align:start position:0%
as a department
 
00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:29.820 align:start position:0%
um a bold Vision called Mission zero
 
00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:30.900 align:start position:0%
which is
 
00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:32.580 align:start position:0%
um Our intention we've been working on
 
00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:34.440 align:start position:0%
this for months it is connected and
 
00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:35.580 align:start position:0%
aligned with the 10-year mental health
 
00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:38.220 align:start position:0%
plan but our aspiration our commitment
 
00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:40.980 align:start position:0%
to achieving a zero wait list
 
00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:43.860 align:start position:0%
um in the next two years
 
00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:45.240 align:start position:0%
um and so that today is actually a
 
00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:46.500 align:start position:0%
pretty important day and I appreciate
 
00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:47.940 align:start position:0%
your asking the question so that I could
 
00:20:51.169 --> 00:20:51.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:54.409 --> 00:20:54.419 align:start position:0%
so so to be clear this zero wait list
 
00:20:57.049 --> 00:20:57.059 align:start position:0%
you're specifically talking about the
 
00:20:59.210 --> 00:20:59.220 align:start position:0%
zero wait list for the ER or for
 
00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
services to prevent somebody from going
 
00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
to the ER because we have all kinds of
 
00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
wait lists and DHHS right it's really a
 
00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:07.860 align:start position:0%
not having people boarding in the
 
00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
emergency department the term we use
 
00:21:10.789 --> 00:21:10.799 align:start position:0%
when people are waiting for more acute
 
00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:12.660 align:start position:0%
Services be it residential inpatient
 
00:21:13.789 --> 00:21:13.799 align:start position:0%
psychiatric or otherwise in the
 
00:21:16.789 --> 00:21:16.799 align:start position:0%
emergency department setting well so so
 
00:21:19.669 --> 00:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
what I heard from your answer is that at
 
00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:22.020 align:start position:0%
this point you think this item is going
 
00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
to help create indirectly the capacity
 
00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:28.020 align:start position:0%
necessary to facilitate the reduction of
 
00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
er boarding but that there's not been
 
00:21:33.409 --> 00:21:33.419 align:start position:0%
any analysis uh just specifically to
 
00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:35.580 align:start position:0%
figure out how to Target this money with
 
00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
the direct objective of reducing the ER
 
00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
boarding you you you is if that's a not
 
00:21:43.789 --> 00:21:43.799 align:start position:0%
a fair summary let me know but but the
 
00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:45.240 align:start position:0%
but to go on
 
00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
um you you just mentioned getting a zero
 
00:21:49.549 --> 00:21:49.559 align:start position:0%
wait list in two years I think the court
 
00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:53.220 align:start position:0%
orders is one year so we have a a bit of
 
00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:55.380 align:start position:0%
a challenge in terms of timing are you
 
00:21:57.529 --> 00:21:57.539 align:start position:0%
are you all able to accelerate and meet
 
00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039 align:start position:0%
the court order
 
00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:01.380 align:start position:0%
um I can't speak to issues related to
 
00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:02.940 align:start position:0%
litigation but what I will say is that
 
00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
there are many things that will be
 
00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:05.700 align:start position:0%
implemented even in the next few months
 
00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
and we're continuing to review the court
 
00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:08.820 align:start position:0%
order and the implications of that for
 
00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:12.380 align:start position:0%
our work all right thank you Mr chair
 
00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:16.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so the department
 
00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:17.210 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so the department
is

00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:17.220 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
asking us in Senate Finance for to
 
00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
extend the deadline for spending six
 
00:22:27.529 --> 00:22:27.539 align:start position:0%
million dollars of housing
 
00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:30.260 align:start position:0%
but also to
 
00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:33.480 align:start position:0%
appropriate another 11 and a half
 
00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
million dollars of system of care funds
 
00:22:40.549 --> 00:22:40.559 align:start position:0%
does this million dollars affect either
 
00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
of those two tasks that's a great
 
00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:46.500 align:start position:0%
question so this funding will actually
 
00:22:48.649 --> 00:22:48.659 align:start position:0%
um cover the increased level of
 
00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
residential needs
 
00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:52.620 align:start position:0%
um in the current biennium whereas the
 
00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:54.900 align:start position:0%
funding you're you're referring to which
 
00:22:57.289 --> 00:22:57.299 align:start position:0%
includes uh the possibility of increased
 
00:22:59.450 --> 00:22:59.460 align:start position:0%
rates for residential care to meet you
 
00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
know what we have learned is the
 
00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
requirements under our current
 
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
um Workforce needs and complexities that
 
00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:07.740 align:start position:0%
would be for the next biennium so they
 
00:23:09.529 --> 00:23:09.539 align:start position:0%
they are related but this is really
 
00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:11.940 align:start position:0%
covering the the current period the
 
00:23:15.289 --> 00:23:15.299 align:start position:0%
current time frame and and just the
 
00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:19.020 align:start position:0%
housing I mean you're transferring money
 
00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:22.440 align:start position:0%
out of housing that you've asked us to
 
00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
extend the deadline does that mean it
 
00:23:27.529 --> 00:23:27.539 align:start position:0%
won't be six million dollars of housing
 
00:23:27.539 --> 00:23:28.370 align:start position:0%
won't be six million dollars of housing
where

00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:28.380 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:23:32.649 --> 00:23:32.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
no the those those funds are separate um
 
00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:37.860 align:start position:0%
what one of the challenges that we've
 
00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:39.900 align:start position:0%
had is the I believe the rental vacancy
 
00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
rate in New Hampshire is less than one
 
00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:43.070 align:start position:0%
rate in New Hampshire is less than one
percent

00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
um so those funds have not been able to
 
00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
be utilized which is why they're
 
00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:47.580 align:start position:0%
available here
 
00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:49.260 align:start position:0%
um based on current projected spend they
 
00:23:51.409 --> 00:23:51.419 align:start position:0%
won't be used this year These funds are
 
00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:55.260 --> 00:24:01.190 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:04.549 --> 00:24:04.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:06.780 align:start position:0%
representative Irv thank you Mr chair
 
00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:08.100 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:10.380 align:start position:0%
so I come from a rural area and I just
 
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
like to understand specifically how this
 
00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:13.500 align:start position:0%
might actually work out and I'll
 
00:24:15.049 --> 00:24:15.059 align:start position:0%
acknowledge up front my wife happens to
 
00:24:16.669 --> 00:24:16.679 align:start position:0%
be an ENT so that's where I get this
 
00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
knowledge from
 
00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
um they have mental crisis occasionally
 
00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:23.340 align:start position:0%
oftentimes in children but also adults
 
00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:25.320 align:start position:0%
and their natural what they all they can
 
00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:26.820 align:start position:0%
do is basically transport to the
 
00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
hospital typically to Concord Hospital
 
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
but off also the Manchester hospitals so
 
00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:34.020 align:start position:0%
in that instance how would this
 
00:24:36.049 --> 00:24:36.059 align:start position:0%
be handled so that they didn't wind up
 
00:24:39.409 --> 00:24:39.419 align:start position:0%
getting admitted to the hospital it's a
 
00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
great question so I think one of the
 
00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:43.500 align:start position:0%
um one of the elements we've been
 
00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:44.940 align:start position:0%
working on as part of our tenure Mental
 
00:24:46.669 --> 00:24:46.679 align:start position:0%
Health Plan has been building out a
 
00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
comprehensive crisis system you're
 
00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
probably familiar with the 988 phone
 
00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:53.460 align:start position:0%
line for people to call as well as the
 
00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
mobile crisis teams that now can be
 
00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
deployed working hand in hand with First
 
00:24:58.970 --> 00:24:58.980 align:start position:0%
Responders to help meet people's needs
 
00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
in the community often de-escalating
 
00:25:01.549 --> 00:25:01.559 align:start position:0%
them on the spot as opposed to even
 
00:25:03.169 --> 00:25:03.179 align:start position:0%
having to bring them to an emergency
 
00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
setting we're also building out crisis
 
00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
stabilization which is the place to go
 
00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:10.620 align:start position:0%
um besides the Ed as a way for people to
 
00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
get care they need and oftentimes move
 
00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:15.240 align:start position:0%
on from there at any one of those levels
 
00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
in the community it may be identified
 
00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:19.140 align:start position:0%
and we now have the Partnerships and the
 
00:25:21.409 --> 00:25:21.419 align:start position:0%
assessments and the support that in fact
 
00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:22.980 align:start position:0%
a youth because what we're talking about
 
00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:25.140 align:start position:0%
here is our residential treatment system
 
00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:26.840 align:start position:0%
which is for young people
 
00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:29.820 align:start position:0%
may have clinical needs that uh that
 
00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:32.580 align:start position:0%
require a stay of a matter of weeks in a
 
00:25:34.490 --> 00:25:34.500 align:start position:0%
therapeutic residential setting but they
 
00:25:36.049 --> 00:25:36.059 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily need to go through
 
00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
emergency or Hospital settings and so
 
00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:41.700 align:start position:0%
that's where that opportunity to divert
 
00:25:44.269 --> 00:25:44.279 align:start position:0%
and to meet their needs would lie
 
00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up okay so I think perhaps either
 
00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
I'm not explaining my question
 
00:25:52.549 --> 00:25:52.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:55.909 --> 00:25:55.919 align:start position:0%
the issue I think is you have a service
 
00:25:57.890 --> 00:25:57.900 align:start position:0%
this isn't where
 
00:26:00.169 --> 00:26:00.179 align:start position:0%
they have no knowledge of anything you
 
00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:02.100 align:start position:0%
just mentioned and and while I am
 
00:26:03.649 --> 00:26:03.659 align:start position:0%
familiar with that with the things you
 
00:26:05.149 --> 00:26:05.159 align:start position:0%
just mentioned I'm not the person that's
 
00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:07.620 align:start position:0%
helping our Ambulance Service learn
 
00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
about them so the reality is what
 
00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:12.360 align:start position:0%
happens oh and I don't think anybody in
 
00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
where I shouldn't say anybody but most
 
00:26:15.769 --> 00:26:15.779 align:start position:0%
people would probably not be aware of
 
00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:17.340 align:start position:0%
any of those Services you just mentioned
 
00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:19.500 align:start position:0%
and know to dial whatever they would
 
00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
call the ambulance typically they might
 
00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:22.860 align:start position:0%
even call the police
 
00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:24.360 align:start position:0%
police might be the first on seeing them
 
00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:25.980 align:start position:0%
the analysis show up and they're all
 
00:26:27.649 --> 00:26:27.659 align:start position:0%
they can all they know to do I don't
 
00:26:29.029 --> 00:26:29.039 align:start position:0%
mean to say all they can do in terms of
 
00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
what's offered but all they're aware to
 
00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
do is to transport to the hospital so
 
00:26:36.289 --> 00:26:36.299 align:start position:0%
how is that situation going to be
 
00:26:37.909 --> 00:26:37.919 align:start position:0%
resolved are you going to do things with
 
00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:39.240 align:start position:0%
the hospitals or you're going to do
 
00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:41.700 align:start position:0%
things with training for the the smaller
 
00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:43.380 align:start position:0%
departments across the state or what
 
00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
we're doing all of the above and I think
 
00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:47.460 align:start position:0%
this is um the Beauty and the challenge
 
00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
of having something that is virtually
 
00:26:51.169 --> 00:26:51.179 align:start position:0%
brand new um all rolled out within the
 
00:26:52.909 --> 00:26:52.919 align:start position:0%
past year year and a half is that it
 
00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:55.620 align:start position:0%
takes time um we have had
 
00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
um incredible levels of consultation at
 
00:26:59.590 --> 00:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
all levels of municipal government
 
00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:01.320 align:start position:0%
stakeholders people with lived
 
00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
experience mental health provider but we
 
00:27:05.149 --> 00:27:05.159 align:start position:0%
have more to do and actually with the
 
00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:07.260 align:start position:0%
support of fiscal we're launching a
 
00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:08.940 align:start position:0%
Communications campaign to do just that
 
00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:10.620 align:start position:0%
to make people aware of the resources
 
00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
and places to call obviously if
 
00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:14.220 align:start position:0%
someone's an imminent risk of harm we
 
00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:16.740 align:start position:0%
want people to call 9-1-1 we don't want
 
00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:19.020 align:start position:0%
people to hesitate to do that we just
 
00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
want to expand the toolbox to provide
 
00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:23.220 align:start position:0%
other options so appreciate your
 
00:27:24.289 --> 00:27:24.299 align:start position:0%
um the personal experience you're
 
00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
bringing to this we have much more work
 
00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
to do but part of it is just the
 
00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:29.940 align:start position:0%
inherent newness of the systems we're
 
00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:33.430 align:start position:0%
inherent newness of the systems we're
building

00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
so is there any thought to working with
 
00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:37.380 align:start position:0%
the hospitals as well so even if
 
00:27:39.049 --> 00:27:39.059 align:start position:0%
everything falls apart as far as before
 
00:27:42.409 --> 00:27:42.419 align:start position:0%
that point so they get to the hospital
 
00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:44.100 align:start position:0%
to interdict at that point is there any
 
00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:46.260 align:start position:0%
plan to try to coordinate that
 
00:27:48.769 --> 00:27:48.779 align:start position:0%
that is happening to an extent in a
 
00:27:50.029 --> 00:27:50.039 align:start position:0%
number of Hospital settings or Community
 
00:27:51.769 --> 00:27:51.779 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Centers partner with many
 
00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
hospitals in a number of regions it's
 
00:27:55.669 --> 00:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
there's no region that is a cookie
 
00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
cutter you know it's different in every
 
00:27:59.690 --> 00:27:59.700 align:start position:0%
place where we're identifying youth that
 
00:28:01.549 --> 00:28:01.559 align:start position:0%
can be or adults for that reason who can
 
00:28:03.769 --> 00:28:03.779 align:start position:0%
be discharged with Supportive Services
 
00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:05.580 align:start position:0%
in the community that that happens all
 
00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
the time
 
00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:08.940 align:start position:0%
um and in fact there's even efforts um
 
00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:10.200 align:start position:0%
you know I haven't mentioned this
 
00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
explicitly but you know within our
 
00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
residential treatment system which is
 
00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
now allowing people to go who are who
 
00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:17.100 align:start position:0%
otherwise had to go through dcyf
 
00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:19.020 align:start position:0%
previously had to have an actual founded
 
00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
allegation of abuse or neglect to access
 
00:28:23.029 --> 00:28:23.039 align:start position:0%
services without not only not having to
 
00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
go to the hospital or having to stay in
 
00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:25.860 align:start position:0%
the hospital but without without having
 
00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
to go through the court system which is
 
00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:40.909 --> 00:28:40.919 align:start position:0%
further questions on
 
00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
item number
 
00:28:46.269 --> 00:28:46.279 align:start position:0%
23 144. I move the item sir all right
 
00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:50.100 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards moves the item
 
00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:52.620 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosenwald seconds is there any
 
00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:56.580 align:start position:0%
further discussion on FIS 23144 seeing
 
00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
none are you ready for the question all
 
00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:32.580 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair
 
00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
um uh I understand that this is uh this
 
00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:38.340 align:start position:0%
is probably a good item and I'm I'm
 
00:29:40.010 --> 00:29:40.020 align:start position:0%
going to vote for it I just would like
 
00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:43.020 align:start position:0%
to know a little bit uh more about some
 
00:29:44.690 --> 00:29:44.700 align:start position:0%
detail that's not included in the
 
00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:46.010 align:start position:0%
detail that's not included in the
write-up

00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:46.020 align:start position:0%
write-up
 
00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:48.740 align:start position:0%
um this is uh this is retroactive money
 
00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:53.100 align:start position:0%
it it says uh or a retroactive spending
 
00:29:55.610 --> 00:29:55.620 align:start position:0%
because of an oversight and getting it
 
00:29:58.190 --> 00:29:58.200 align:start position:0%
spent I think but in any case it's a
 
00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
it's a good it's a good spend and it's
 
00:30:04.370 --> 00:30:04.380 align:start position:0%
supposed to go to support services to
 
00:30:06.769 --> 00:30:06.779 align:start position:0%
eligible infants toddlers birth through
 
00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
two years who demonstrated developmental
 
00:30:12.169 --> 00:30:12.179 align:start position:0%
delay and good with all of that I just
 
00:30:12.179 --> 00:30:12.830 align:start position:0%
delay and good with all of that I just
um

00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:15.769 --> 00:30:15.779 align:start position:0%
with 1.2 million dollars are you able oh
 
00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
hi Miss Hardy how are you
 
00:30:20.090 --> 00:30:20.100 align:start position:0%
good morning uh I I'm just I'm just
 
00:30:22.610 --> 00:30:22.620 align:start position:0%
curious if we can be a little bit more
 
00:30:25.909 --> 00:30:25.919 align:start position:0%
specific about who these checks will go
 
00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:29.480 align:start position:0%
to what kind of provider in a specific
 
00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:32.460 align:start position:0%
description as possible because I I I
 
00:30:34.549 --> 00:30:34.559 align:start position:0%
don't resist this I just want to be able
 
00:30:37.549 --> 00:30:37.559 align:start position:0%
to help communicate that this is going
 
00:30:39.649 --> 00:30:39.659 align:start position:0%
to happen sure um good morning I'm
 
00:30:41.330 --> 00:30:41.340 align:start position:0%
Melissa Hardy I'm the division director
 
00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:44.580 align:start position:0%
for long-term supports and services so
 
00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:46.140 align:start position:0%
there's three contractors that are
 
00:30:50.029 --> 00:30:50.039 align:start position:0%
involved in this item one is Mason
 
00:30:54.409 --> 00:30:54.419 align:start position:0%
Incorporated which is about 250 000 for
 
00:30:56.690 --> 00:30:56.700 align:start position:0%
the development and implementation of a
 
00:30:58.430 --> 00:30:58.440 align:start position:0%
public awareness campaign for early
 
00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:01.500 align:start position:0%
supports and services which is currently
 
00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
um already out there and worked on it
 
00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
and approved by the governor so that is
 
00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
out there for early support Outreach
 
00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:11.220 align:start position:0%
we also have the parent information
 
00:31:13.789 --> 00:31:13.799 align:start position:0%
center for about ninety three thousand
 
00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
dollars to develop and Implement early
 
00:31:18.409 --> 00:31:18.419 align:start position:0%
supports and services educational
 
00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
surrogate parent program which is used
 
00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:23.450 align:start position:0%
surrogate parent program which is used
for

00:31:23.450 --> 00:31:23.460 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
um a lot of dcyf children whose family
 
00:31:29.149 --> 00:31:29.159 align:start position:0%
cannot be found to give consent for
 
00:31:31.610 --> 00:31:31.620 align:start position:0%
early intervention services
 
00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:33.350 align:start position:0%
early intervention services
and

00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:31:36.649 --> 00:31:36.659 align:start position:0%
sure the parent information center
 
00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:40.200 align:start position:0%
and then finally about two uh 200 000
 
00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:43.320 align:start position:0%
for a centria community services
 
00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
um and that's for the translation of
 
00:31:48.049 --> 00:31:48.059 align:start position:0%
documents into different languages so
 
00:31:50.269 --> 00:31:50.279 align:start position:0%
that families who um English is not
 
00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:52.440 align:start position:0%
their primary language can have
 
00:31:55.010 --> 00:31:55.020 align:start position:0%
documents translated in their language
 
00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
for understanding
 
00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:58.190 align:start position:0%
for understanding
follow-up

00:31:58.190 --> 00:31:58.200 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
okay so that's about half of the 1.2
 
00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
million those three items what what what
 
00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
what about the other half
 
00:32:08.389 --> 00:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
because because I'm reading that we're
 
00:32:10.850 --> 00:32:10.860 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with
 
00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:12.310 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with
um

00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
1.218 million and 250 250 and 93 is is
 
00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
less than 600 000 so I'm just curious
 
00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
about the rest of it it so this is a the
 
00:32:27.470 --> 00:32:27.480 align:start position:0%
reason why you're not seeing any
 
00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:29.700 align:start position:0%
additional dollars here is the original
 
00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
requested action was for the 1.2 million
 
00:32:34.549 --> 00:32:34.559 align:start position:0%
dollars and that that was from from the
 
00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
year prior
 
00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:38.580 align:start position:0%
this this item here
 
00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:41.340 align:start position:0%
um the original Grant ended September
 
00:32:45.649 --> 00:32:45.659 align:start position:0%
30th of of 2022 and so what Melissa's
 
00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:46.980 align:start position:0%
referring to is the new price
 
00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:49.320 align:start position:0%
limitations that are associated with it
 
00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:53.580 align:start position:0%
with the dollars after the extension
 
00:32:56.930 --> 00:32:56.940 align:start position:0%
in September of 2022 not prior to that
 
00:32:59.930 --> 00:32:59.940 align:start position:0%
because the original item if you turn to
 
00:33:03.529 --> 00:33:03.539 align:start position:0%
pay well to to the original item this
 
00:33:06.529 --> 00:33:06.539 align:start position:0%
this was approved in September 22 this
 
00:33:09.289 --> 00:33:09.299 align:start position:0%
was back in September of 2021 so those
 
00:33:11.149 --> 00:33:11.159 align:start position:0%
other dollars were previously spent
 
00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:13.380 align:start position:0%
within that Grant period these are the
 
00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:16.380 align:start position:0%
dollars after the these are the dollars
 
00:33:21.649 --> 00:33:21.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:21.659 --> 00:33:23.269 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:33:23.269 --> 00:33:23.279 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:33:26.210 --> 00:33:26.220 align:start position:0%
look at page one of that request and
 
00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:28.500 align:start position:0%
you'll see the other items that add up
 
00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
to the 1.2
 
00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
yes sir my curiosity was
 
00:33:37.389 --> 00:33:37.399 align:start position:0%
um after we approved this what entities
 
00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:40.980 align:start position:0%
may be expecting to be paid some money
 
00:33:44.509 --> 00:33:44.519 align:start position:0%
that that would not be paid if we did
 
00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:48.120 align:start position:0%
not approve this and and and Miss Hardy
 
00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:50.580 align:start position:0%
gave me a great explanation on about
 
00:33:54.289 --> 00:33:54.299 align:start position:0%
half of it and I I can go offline to try
 
00:33:57.169 --> 00:33:57.179 align:start position:0%
to understand the rest of it because uh
 
00:33:59.630 --> 00:33:59.640 align:start position:0%
because I I I don't understand Mr
 
00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:01.260 align:start position:0%
White's answer
 
00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:04.200 align:start position:0%
so I don't want to belabor it it's not
 
00:34:07.389 --> 00:34:07.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:11.869 --> 00:34:11.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:13.260 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
00:34:15.070 --> 00:34:15.080 align:start position:0%
Senator gray
 
00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
Senate also asked to have this item
 
00:34:20.149 --> 00:34:20.159 align:start position:0%
pulled and the word retroactive is the
 
00:34:23.329 --> 00:34:23.339 align:start position:0%
reason for that the original item you
 
00:34:24.909 --> 00:34:24.919 align:start position:0%
know through gel car
 
00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:30.540 align:start position:0%
through gel car on October of 21's whole
 
00:34:32.149 --> 00:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
thing should have been done by September
 
00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
of 22 and now here we are many months
 
00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:39.780 align:start position:0%
later and I know that some of the
 
00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:43.260 align:start position:0%
testimony you know based on Senate I
 
00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:45.320 align:start position:0%
mean representative Edwards questions
 
00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:48.540 align:start position:0%
touched on that I just
 
00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:50.820 align:start position:0%
since it's a pet peeve of mine I wanted
 
00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
to let you respond sure so
 
00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
within the Department of Health and
 
00:34:57.890 --> 00:34:57.900 align:start position:0%
Human Services we have Financial
 
00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:00.420 align:start position:0%
directors assigned to each major
 
00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:01.880 align:start position:0%
division area
 
00:35:05.690 --> 00:35:05.700 align:start position:0%
within dltss about a year and a half ago
 
00:35:07.609 --> 00:35:07.619 align:start position:0%
we had a complete overhaul or not
 
00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
overhaul but we lost our a number of
 
00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:12.540 align:start position:0%
Staff within that area our financial
 
00:35:15.349 --> 00:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
director our financial managers as well
 
00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:17.640 align:start position:0%
one of the individuals had over 20 years
 
00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
experience as a result of that
 
00:35:25.730 --> 00:35:25.740 align:start position:0%
we we did not have the the frankly the
 
00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:27.780 align:start position:0%
the controls in place because much of it
 
00:35:30.050 --> 00:35:30.060 align:start position:0%
was memory based and all this really is
 
00:35:32.089 --> 00:35:32.099 align:start position:0%
tied back to the commissioner's road map
 
00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:34.980 align:start position:0%
where we were looking at Recruitment and
 
00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
and retention and since that point in
 
00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:39.050 align:start position:0%
and retention and since that point in
time

00:35:39.050 --> 00:35:39.060 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:35:42.290 --> 00:35:42.300 align:start position:0%
the team within dltss has established a
 
00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
standardized inventory of all the grants
 
00:35:47.390 --> 00:35:47.400 align:start position:0%
this was a unique situation where
 
00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
normally we get a formal notice written
 
00:35:51.829 --> 00:35:51.839 align:start position:0%
formal notice of award from the federal
 
00:35:54.829 --> 00:35:54.839 align:start position:0%
government this was a odd case where we
 
00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
did not receive that in the sense that
 
00:35:59.270 --> 00:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
there was a FAQ a frequently asked
 
00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:03.060 align:start position:0%
questions that was put out in lieu of a
 
00:36:04.970 --> 00:36:04.980 align:start position:0%
notice of award I'm not quite sure why
 
00:36:07.089 --> 00:36:07.099 align:start position:0%
that happened at the federal level
 
00:36:10.069 --> 00:36:10.079 align:start position:0%
this this is an issue from from my
 
00:36:12.109 --> 00:36:12.119 align:start position:0%
perspective and it has it has been
 
00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:14.280 align:start position:0%
resolved I'm also looking at this more
 
00:36:16.910 --> 00:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
broadly in the sense that I do have many
 
00:36:18.310 --> 00:36:18.320 align:start position:0%
senior staff
 
00:36:21.109 --> 00:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
within within finance that will be
 
00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
retiring in future years and we have
 
00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
begun some succession planning as well
 
00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
as further efforts on formally
 
00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
documenting policies and procedures I'm
 
00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:34.020 align:start position:0%
a former auditor I'm very big when it
 
00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:35.820 align:start position:0%
comes to that and I do recognize that
 
00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:37.260 align:start position:0%
there is a need that will continue to
 
00:36:40.130 --> 00:36:40.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:44.329 --> 00:36:44.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
item number 152 Senator gray moose to
 
00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:48.349 align:start position:0%
item number 152 Senator gray moose to
approve

00:36:48.349 --> 00:36:48.359 align:start position:0%
approve
 
00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
Senator Dallas Andrews seconds any
 
00:36:52.010 --> 00:36:52.020 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
00:36:53.390 --> 00:36:53.400 align:start position:0%
seeing none of you ready for the
 
00:36:55.250 --> 00:36:55.260 align:start position:0%
question all in favor say aye aye
 
00:36:59.390 --> 00:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
opposed no the item is adopted the last
 
00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
uh HS
 
00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:03.780 align:start position:0%
excuse me HHS item
 
00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.490 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:37:10.490 --> 00:37:10.500 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:18.540 align:start position:0%
recognize Senator Edwards uh thank you
 
00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:20.940 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards I I'm starting to
 
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
thank you uh thank you Mr chair so
 
00:37:29.810 --> 00:37:29.820 align:start position:0%
um I
 
00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
I'm just looking for some clarification
 
00:37:35.569 --> 00:37:35.579 align:start position:0%
on what the most recent thinking is
 
00:37:39.650 --> 00:37:39.660 align:start position:0%
relative to using uh if you if you look
 
00:37:44.349 --> 00:37:44.359 align:start position:0%
at a attachment a the very last item
 
00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
21-100 uh it's uh deals with the 1.1
 
00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:51.420 align:start position:0%
million that we've already approved to
 
00:37:53.450 --> 00:37:53.460 align:start position:0%
accept from the federal government long
 
00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
ago and we've been spending it down and
 
00:37:59.930 --> 00:37:59.940 align:start position:0%
now there's some indeterminable from my
 
00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
perspective amount of money that's still
 
00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
to be spent on this item
 
00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
it's to be spent on multiple items the
 
00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:12.540 align:start position:0%
one that catches my eye is the one where
 
00:38:16.010 --> 00:38:16.020 align:start position:0%
we're going to continue our our previous
 
00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
state policy of spending Federal money
 
00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:22.200 align:start position:0%
to provide the coveted vaccine to
 
00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:23.270 align:start position:0%
to provide the coveted vaccine to
children

00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:38:25.390 --> 00:38:25.400 align:start position:0%
and I think
 
00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
given the amount of information that has
 
00:38:32.210 --> 00:38:32.220 align:start position:0%
come to the four over the last year
 
00:38:35.690 --> 00:38:35.700 align:start position:0%
about the effectiveness of covid and and
 
00:38:39.349 --> 00:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
really where that and that injection was
 
00:38:43.370 --> 00:38:43.380 align:start position:0%
best used I I want to come back and
 
00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:45.589 align:start position:0%
best used I I want to come back and
challenge

00:38:45.589 --> 00:38:45.599 align:start position:0%
challenge
 
00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
a state sanctioned policy that still
 
00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
wants to make this covet injection
 
00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
available to otherwise healthy kids I
 
00:38:57.950 --> 00:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
don't think that's a state something we
 
00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
want to sanction so so my question is
 
00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
for that particular subset of that
 
00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
particular line item
 
00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:10.200 align:start position:0%
are you able to tell me how much
 
00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
additional money would be spent to
 
00:39:17.450 --> 00:39:17.460 align:start position:0%
make the vaccine available to otherwise
 
00:39:18.849 --> 00:39:18.859 align:start position:0%
healthy kids
 
00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
that if that that that if we didn't
 
00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:25.260 align:start position:0%
approve this that money would not go to
 
00:39:27.230 --> 00:39:27.240 align:start position:0%
that purpose
 
00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:29.030 align:start position:0%
that purpose
okay

00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
um just for clarification representative
 
00:39:33.349 --> 00:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
Edwards can you clarify is this page one
 
00:39:35.810 --> 00:39:35.820 align:start position:0%
of attachment a or page two and one line
 
00:39:39.109 --> 00:39:39.119 align:start position:0%
which item number I'll do that it's the
 
00:39:42.609 --> 00:39:42.619 align:start position:0%
um it's the last item on attachment a
 
00:39:48.890 --> 00:39:48.900 align:start position:0%
and the item number is listed as 21-100
 
00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:53.640 align:start position:0%
and and when you read to the right on it
 
00:39:56.810 --> 00:39:56.820 align:start position:0%
the comments section describes a number
 
00:39:59.569 --> 00:39:59.579 align:start position:0%
of things for which that money was
 
00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:02.700 align:start position:0%
previously authorized to spend on
 
00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
of those things the only one that's
 
00:40:08.089 --> 00:40:08.099 align:start position:0%
given me heartburn is the part where
 
00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:09.960 align:start position:0%
we're we're going to continue to spend
 
00:40:12.829 --> 00:40:12.839 align:start position:0%
money to make the vaccine of I don't
 
00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
like the word vaccine it's not a vaccine
 
00:40:19.490 --> 00:40:19.500 align:start position:0%
but um this this coveted shot available
 
00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
to Healthy Kids
 
00:40:24.290 --> 00:40:24.300 align:start position:0%
so I I don't have that specific
 
00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
information available at this point in
 
00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
time I'd have to go back and dig into
 
00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
that and work with the public health
 
00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
Team to get that exact information
 
00:40:35.569 --> 00:40:35.579 align:start position:0%
um this this requested it mirrors the
 
00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:39.240 align:start position:0%
fist 23 166 and 167 in a sense of I
 
00:40:41.329 --> 00:40:41.339 align:start position:0%
understand turning those funds forward
 
00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
um I don't believe they're at this point
 
00:40:45.770 --> 00:40:45.780 align:start position:0%
in time if if you if you needed to wait
 
00:40:48.109 --> 00:40:48.119 align:start position:0%
until you had that information
 
00:40:49.370 --> 00:40:49.380 align:start position:0%
um I don't believe there would be any
 
00:40:51.470 --> 00:40:51.480 align:start position:0%
negative impact to tabling I'm not
 
00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
suggesting that but I'm just putting
 
00:40:54.290 --> 00:40:54.300 align:start position:0%
that out there because I'm assuming that
 
00:40:55.849 --> 00:40:55.859 align:start position:0%
may be the next question
 
00:40:58.550 --> 00:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
so so this I I haven't talked to our
 
00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:01.380 align:start position:0%
Senate colleagues on this Mr chair
 
00:41:06.770 --> 00:41:06.780 align:start position:0%
um but I I would like to have us table
 
00:41:09.890 --> 00:41:09.900 align:start position:0%
item 21-100
 
00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:11.450 align:start position:0%
item 21-100
only

00:41:11.450 --> 00:41:11.460 align:start position:0%
only
 
00:41:13.849 --> 00:41:13.859 align:start position:0%
uh so that we can get some additional
 
00:41:16.490 --> 00:41:16.500 align:start position:0%
information because I I think it's
 
00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:20.220 align:start position:0%
important for the state to go back and
 
00:41:23.810 --> 00:41:23.820 align:start position:0%
revisit the policy the efficacy the
 
00:41:28.730 --> 00:41:28.740 align:start position:0%
safety of providing this to our children
 
00:41:32.329 --> 00:41:32.339 align:start position:0%
so our healthy children so so
 
00:41:32.339 --> 00:41:33.349 align:start position:0%
so our healthy children so so
um

00:41:33.349 --> 00:41:33.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to make that motion and
 
00:41:37.069 --> 00:41:37.079 align:start position:0%
maybe have some discussion because I
 
00:41:38.450 --> 00:41:38.460 align:start position:0%
don't know where other people are on
 
00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:41.460 align:start position:0%
this okay so the motion is to adopt the
 
00:41:44.530 --> 00:41:44.540 align:start position:0%
item with the exception of
 
00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:46.569 align:start position:0%
item with the exception of
21-100

00:41:46.569 --> 00:41:46.579 align:start position:0%
21-100
 
00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
21-100 which which will be tabled
 
00:41:55.490 --> 00:41:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:57.710 --> 00:41:57.720 align:start position:0%
in a second by
 
00:41:57.720 --> 00:41:59.589 align:start position:0%
in a second by
representative

00:41:59.589 --> 00:41:59.599 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
further discussions Senator gray
 
00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:05.460 align:start position:0%
um certainly I think that there's other
 
00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:08.460 align:start position:0%
vehicles that we can use to express our
 
00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
opinion to the department I don't see
 
00:42:14.109 --> 00:42:14.119 align:start position:0%
you holding this up to do that and
 
00:42:17.450 --> 00:42:17.460 align:start position:0%
certainly I'll vote against the all of
 
00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:19.320 align:start position:0%
the items on there but I will vote
 
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:26.820 align:start position:0%
further discussion I mean I get
 
00:42:28.550 --> 00:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
clarification on what the senator just
 
00:42:31.069 --> 00:42:31.079 align:start position:0%
said did did I understand that he would
 
00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:33.240 align:start position:0%
be open to tabling the whole item but
 
00:42:35.450 --> 00:42:35.460 align:start position:0%
not just one line item of it no sir I
 
00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:37.140 align:start position:0%
support the whole thing okay I
 
00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
misunderstood thank you that there are
 
00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:41.700 align:start position:0%
other vehicles that we can use to
 
00:42:43.970 --> 00:42:43.980 align:start position:0%
express our opinion to the department
 
00:42:46.370 --> 00:42:46.380 align:start position:0%
about how the These funds should be used
 
00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:48.170 align:start position:0%
about how the These funds should be used
and

00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:48.180 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
parents that that want their children
 
00:42:52.849 --> 00:42:52.859 align:start position:0%
vaccinated we should vaccinate them and
 
00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
parents that don't want their children
 
00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
vaccinated we should not vaccinate them
 
00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:57.290 align:start position:0%
vaccinated we should not vaccinate them
so

00:42:57.290 --> 00:42:57.300 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:42:59.750 --> 00:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
that's where I stand
 
00:43:04.370 --> 00:43:04.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:06.589 --> 00:43:06.599 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I think the
 
00:43:09.470 --> 00:43:09.480 align:start position:0%
department has and I'm not sure how
 
00:43:12.650 --> 00:43:12.660 align:start position:0%
they've testified in front of the uh
 
00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
house Health and Human Services
 
00:43:16.329 --> 00:43:16.339 align:start position:0%
committee or even
 
00:43:19.609 --> 00:43:19.619 align:start position:0%
division three but certainly
 
00:43:22.370 --> 00:43:22.380 align:start position:0%
um because I've asked this repeatedly
 
00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:25.079 align:start position:0%
in Senate Health and Human Services
 
00:43:28.790 --> 00:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
there's no move no thought of a move by
 
00:43:30.410 --> 00:43:30.420 align:start position:0%
the department unless something has
 
00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
changed in the last month to
 
00:43:37.010 --> 00:43:37.020 align:start position:0%
um try and add
 
00:43:41.569 --> 00:43:41.579 align:start position:0%
the covet shot as a mandatory vaccine I
 
00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:43.800 align:start position:0%
think that's the right policy it should
 
00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:45.230 align:start position:0%
think that's the right policy it should
be

00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:45.240 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
um up to the parents discretion and the
 
00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:51.050 align:start position:0%
um up to the parents discretion and the
department

00:43:51.050 --> 00:43:51.060 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
to the best of my knowledge and the
 
00:43:55.130 --> 00:43:55.140 align:start position:0%
commissioner is nodding thank you very
 
00:43:57.109 --> 00:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
much there's no change in that position
 
00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:01.500 align:start position:0%
so I'm happy if this policy there are
 
00:44:04.370 --> 00:44:04.380 align:start position:0%
this fiscal item goes through and should
 
00:44:08.829 --> 00:44:08.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:11.930 --> 00:44:11.940 align:start position:0%
so so thank you Senators gray and
 
00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
Bradley I appreciate the wisdom and I
 
00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:17.880 align:start position:0%
don't really disagree with you I I I I
 
00:44:22.370 --> 00:44:22.380 align:start position:0%
do not want uh the state of New
 
00:44:25.510 --> 00:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to be creating an implied
 
00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:28.200 align:start position:0%
warranty that this is a safe and
 
00:44:30.410 --> 00:44:30.420 align:start position:0%
efficacious drug for healthy children I
 
00:44:32.329 --> 00:44:32.339 align:start position:0%
just don't want to be associated with
 
00:44:35.930 --> 00:44:35.940 align:start position:0%
that policy so uh as as a as a personal
 
00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
professional matter I'm going to vote
 
00:44:40.370 --> 00:44:40.380 align:start position:0%

00:46:09.410 --> 00:46:09.420 align:start position:0%
all right now moving on to the other
 
00:46:12.349 --> 00:46:12.359 align:start position:0%
items that have been removed
 
00:46:14.270 --> 00:46:14.280 align:start position:0%
the next one we'll address is from the
 
00:46:17.329 --> 00:46:17.339 align:start position:0%
business and industry 23 146 under tab
 
00:46:17.339 --> 00:46:31.550 align:start position:0%
business and industry 23 146 under tab

00:46:31.550 --> 00:46:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:33.349 --> 00:46:33.359 align:start position:0%
good morning Taylor Caswell commissioner
 
00:46:34.609 --> 00:46:34.619 align:start position:0%
Department of Business and economic
 
00:46:34.619 --> 00:46:38.089 align:start position:0%
Department of Business and economic
affairs

00:46:38.089 --> 00:46:38.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:39.950 --> 00:46:39.960 align:start position:0%
and someone from the Senate wanted to
 
00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:46.910 --> 00:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
had that down request from the Senate to
 
00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:54.290 --> 00:46:54.300 align:start position:0%
um my notes don't show any Senate poll
 
00:46:58.550 --> 00:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
on that one okay uh that it was uh oh I
 
00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
did have a question
 
00:47:02.829 --> 00:47:02.839 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosenwald
 
00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
calling it thank you sorry I'm taking
 
00:47:07.609 --> 00:47:07.619 align:start position:0%
them out of order okay
 
00:47:07.619 --> 00:47:09.770 align:start position:0%
them out of order okay
um

00:47:09.770 --> 00:47:09.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:14.329 --> 00:47:14.339 align:start position:0%
I'm two questions really how much arpa
 
00:47:16.010 --> 00:47:16.020 align:start position:0%
funding is still
 
00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:17.329 align:start position:0%
funding is still
on

00:47:17.329 --> 00:47:17.339 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:47:21.410 --> 00:47:21.420 align:start position:0%
allocated and will this project be
 
00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
competitively bid or is uh go for
 
00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:29.160 align:start position:0%
looking at a sole source contract
 
00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
so first just for clarification I'm on
 
00:47:34.130 --> 00:47:34.140 align:start position:0%
the left hand side of the table so I'm
 
00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of ba here when I go over
 
00:47:39.230 --> 00:47:39.240 align:start position:0%
there I'll be the Gopher okay but that's
 
00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
just a light way of saying that this is
 
00:47:43.010 --> 00:47:43.020 align:start position:0%
an item through ba
 
00:47:47.210 --> 00:47:47.220 align:start position:0%
um so your first question was
 
00:47:52.309 --> 00:47:52.319 align:start position:0%
um regarding the availability of go for
 
00:47:55.250 --> 00:47:55.260 align:start position:0%
of arpa funds right so
 
00:47:55.260 --> 00:47:56.329 align:start position:0%
of arpa funds right so
um

00:47:56.329 --> 00:47:56.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:57.890 --> 00:47:57.900 align:start position:0%
in that regard
 
00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
we have reached I think a point where
 
00:48:03.349 --> 00:48:03.359 align:start position:0%
the amount of obligated funds that have
 
00:48:04.670 --> 00:48:04.680 align:start position:0%
flowed through this committee and
 
00:48:06.589 --> 00:48:06.599 align:start position:0%
through governor and Council have
 
00:48:09.230 --> 00:48:09.240 align:start position:0%
reached the extent of the fiscal
 
00:48:11.210 --> 00:48:11.220 align:start position:0%
Recovery Fund allocation that we had
 
00:48:14.329 --> 00:48:14.339 align:start position:0%
from the federal government which is 994
 
00:48:16.270 --> 00:48:16.280 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:48:19.609 --> 00:48:19.619 align:start position:0%
there are remaining
 
00:48:23.150 --> 00:48:23.160 align:start position:0%
um funds that continue to be spent by
 
00:48:25.910 --> 00:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
agencies across state government
 
00:48:29.569 --> 00:48:29.579 align:start position:0%
uh and there's also a number of requests
 
00:48:33.349 --> 00:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
that remain in the pipeline of funds to
 
00:48:35.690 --> 00:48:35.700 align:start position:0%
be used under the fiscal Recovery Fund
 
00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:39.660 align:start position:0%
so while we have reached the end of the
 
00:48:41.809 --> 00:48:41.819 align:start position:0%
uh point where we can obligate
 
00:48:44.030 --> 00:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
additional funds
 
00:48:46.190 --> 00:48:46.200 align:start position:0%
um that are sort of not have not
 
00:48:48.530 --> 00:48:48.540 align:start position:0%
previously been obligated
 
00:48:50.569 --> 00:48:50.579 align:start position:0%
um there will be continue to be a churn
 
00:48:53.089 --> 00:48:53.099 align:start position:0%
of of funds that are either reallocated
 
00:48:56.569 --> 00:48:56.579 align:start position:0%
or other situations where we might need
 
00:48:59.510 --> 00:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
to reallocate before the deadline of
 
00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
December 2024. okay
 
00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
was is this contract going to be
 
00:49:10.970 --> 00:49:10.980 align:start position:0%
competitively bid so as you know we we
 
00:49:14.270 --> 00:49:14.280 align:start position:0%
um uh we had a competitive process for
 
00:49:17.569 --> 00:49:17.579 align:start position:0%
the plan that was developed uh that has
 
00:49:19.849 --> 00:49:19.859 align:start position:0%
led us to this point
 
00:49:23.210 --> 00:49:23.220 align:start position:0%
um that took a lot less time than we had
 
00:49:27.190 --> 00:49:27.200 align:start position:0%
anticipated and the robust
 
00:49:30.589 --> 00:49:30.599 align:start position:0%
the robust level of information and
 
00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
strategy that has been put into this
 
00:49:35.089 --> 00:49:35.099 align:start position:0%
effort led us to the conclusion that we
 
00:49:37.490 --> 00:49:37.500 align:start position:0%
would like to amend the contract that we
 
00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:39.720 align:start position:0%
are currently operating under to
 
00:49:42.370 --> 00:49:42.380 align:start position:0%
continue to work with the vendor that
 
00:49:44.530 --> 00:49:44.540 align:start position:0%
developed the plan
 
00:49:46.910 --> 00:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
I think there are a number of reasons
 
00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
for that not the least of which is the
 
00:49:51.410 --> 00:49:51.420 align:start position:0%
expertise that they bring to the table
 
00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
and the relationships that we've
 
00:49:54.650 --> 00:49:54.660 align:start position:0%
developed among nine or ten different
 
00:49:58.190 --> 00:49:58.200 align:start position:0%
agencies to get us this point but as you
 
00:50:00.829 --> 00:50:00.839 align:start position:0%
know Senator we're also under a time
 
00:50:03.050 --> 00:50:03.060 align:start position:0%
constraint with the use of the arpa
 
00:50:06.829 --> 00:50:06.839 align:start position:0%
funds so we want to be able to continue
 
00:50:10.010 --> 00:50:10.020 align:start position:0%
the momentum of this project which I
 
00:50:13.210 --> 00:50:13.220 align:start position:0%
think is very substantial and a
 
00:50:15.550 --> 00:50:15.560 align:start position:0%
significant investment
 
00:50:18.530 --> 00:50:18.540 align:start position:0%
to improve the relationship between
 
00:50:20.569 --> 00:50:20.579 align:start position:0%
state agencies and our business
 
00:50:20.579 --> 00:50:22.250 align:start position:0%
state agencies and our business

00:50:23.930 --> 00:50:23.940 align:start position:0%
um all of which was in the item and I
 
00:50:27.109 --> 00:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
think we did actually send over the the
 
00:50:28.910 --> 00:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
full report that we had from the vendor
 
00:50:32.930 --> 00:50:32.940 align:start position:0%
that is over 100 pages long so I don't
 
00:50:34.130 --> 00:50:34.140 align:start position:0%
expect that you've been through every
 
00:50:35.890 --> 00:50:35.900 align:start position:0%
bit of that but I think
 
00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
given the time constraints and given
 
00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
where we stand in this process our hope
 
00:50:44.990 --> 00:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
is to amend that contract
 
00:50:51.609 --> 00:50:51.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:54.530 --> 00:50:54.540 align:start position:0%
represent a Earth for a question thank
 
00:50:56.510 --> 00:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and yes thank you for
 
00:50:58.970 --> 00:50:58.980 align:start position:0%
sending that report that was awesome did
 
00:51:00.349 --> 00:51:00.359 align:start position:0%
not have a time to read through the
 
00:51:01.490 --> 00:51:01.500 align:start position:0%
whole thing
 
00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:03.240 align:start position:0%
um but did have some time to peruse it
 
00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
and if I could I'd like to just get you
 
00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
to give some more details specifically
 
00:51:09.829 --> 00:51:09.839 align:start position:0%
regarding release one first of all it's
 
00:51:12.049 --> 00:51:12.059 align:start position:0%
a four month Pro period of time
 
00:51:14.270 --> 00:51:14.280 align:start position:0%
apparently I'd be curious when it when
 
00:51:16.010 --> 00:51:16.020 align:start position:0%
that starts but more importantly I'd be
 
00:51:17.329 --> 00:51:17.339 align:start position:0%
curious I've read through kind of the
 
00:51:19.250 --> 00:51:19.260 align:start position:0%
things that you're expecting there if
 
00:51:20.510 --> 00:51:20.520 align:start position:0%
maybe you're going a little more depth
 
00:51:22.910 --> 00:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
in terms of what the expectation would
 
00:51:25.670 --> 00:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
be of businesses like my own I've done a
 
00:51:27.290 --> 00:51:27.300 align:start position:0%
lot of stuff through the website over
 
00:51:28.849 --> 00:51:28.859 align:start position:0%
the last years and it's gotten better
 
00:51:30.530 --> 00:51:30.540 align:start position:0%
but it's still very hard to find things
 
00:51:32.450 --> 00:51:32.460 align:start position:0%
and even as a State Rep it's quite hard
 
00:51:33.589 --> 00:51:33.599 align:start position:0%
to find these I don't mean specifically
 
00:51:35.210 --> 00:51:35.220 align:start position:0%
your stuff but the website in general
 
00:51:36.829 --> 00:51:36.839 align:start position:0%
but if you could speak to the the
 
00:51:38.569 --> 00:51:38.579 align:start position:0%
release one part of this project I'd
 
00:51:41.089 --> 00:51:41.099 align:start position:0%
really appreciate it sure so
 
00:51:43.870 --> 00:51:43.880 align:start position:0%
um again I think this is
 
00:51:46.970 --> 00:51:46.980 align:start position:0%
this potentially represents a pretty
 
00:51:49.250 --> 00:51:49.260 align:start position:0%
Bellwether change in the way that the
 
00:51:51.470 --> 00:51:51.480 align:start position:0%
state interfaces with businesses
 
00:51:53.630 --> 00:51:53.640 align:start position:0%
particularly small and medium-sized
 
00:51:57.589 --> 00:51:57.599 align:start position:0%
businesses Our Hope with phase one is to
 
00:52:00.170 --> 00:52:00.180 align:start position:0%
consolidate the resources that are
 
00:52:02.690 --> 00:52:02.700 align:start position:0%
currently available across all the state
 
00:52:05.690 --> 00:52:05.700 align:start position:0%
agencies that have a direct relationship
 
00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
with the business community and right
 
00:52:10.270 --> 00:52:10.280 align:start position:0%
now that represents nine state agencies
 
00:52:12.410 --> 00:52:12.420 align:start position:0%
and to be able to bring on new
 
00:52:15.290 --> 00:52:15.300 align:start position:0%
functionality to the way to the type of
 
00:52:18.589 --> 00:52:18.599 align:start position:0%
interaction that businesses can can have
 
00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
with those agencies online
 
00:52:24.290 --> 00:52:24.300 align:start position:0%
so the first phase really is defined as
 
00:52:27.290 --> 00:52:27.300 align:start position:0%
what we call minimum viable product and
 
00:52:28.490 --> 00:52:28.500 align:start position:0%
working with Department of Information
 
00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
Technology we would be centralizing a
 
00:52:34.549 --> 00:52:34.559 align:start position:0%
website that would allow businesses to
 
00:52:36.589 --> 00:52:36.599 align:start position:0%
be able to access permitting
 
00:52:39.770 --> 00:52:39.780 align:start position:0%
registrations filing licensing and of
 
00:52:41.770 --> 00:52:41.780 align:start position:0%
various numbers of Support Services
 
00:52:44.690 --> 00:52:44.700 align:start position:0%
directly online we would drastically
 
00:52:46.730 --> 00:52:46.740 align:start position:0%
improve the search and navigation
 
00:52:49.690 --> 00:52:49.700 align:start position:0%
functionality of that under phase one
 
00:52:53.089 --> 00:52:53.099 align:start position:0%
and we would begin the process of
 
00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
something that I think it sounds small
 
00:52:56.569 --> 00:52:56.579 align:start position:0%
but is actually a big deal in my view
 
00:52:58.849 --> 00:52:58.859 align:start position:0%
which is a checklist for individual
 
00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
businesses to know what are the things
 
00:53:03.410 --> 00:53:03.420 align:start position:0%
that you either are required to do or
 
00:53:05.150 --> 00:53:05.160 align:start position:0%
you have access to or that you are
 
00:53:08.530 --> 00:53:08.540 align:start position:0%
eligible for that would be
 
00:53:10.990 --> 00:53:11.000 align:start position:0%
tailored effectively for those
 
00:53:14.210 --> 00:53:14.220 align:start position:0%
businesses and that first step the
 
00:53:16.130 --> 00:53:16.140 align:start position:0%
second phase is where it starts to get
 
00:53:17.870 --> 00:53:17.880 align:start position:0%
really cool because we're going to be
 
00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
able to have individual identifiers for
 
00:53:22.309 --> 00:53:22.319 align:start position:0%
businesses so for your business you
 
00:53:24.049 --> 00:53:24.059 align:start position:0%
would have one identifier that would go
 
00:53:27.170 --> 00:53:27.180 align:start position:0%
across All State agencies and would
 
00:53:30.770 --> 00:53:30.780 align:start position:0%
among other things I think really
 
00:53:32.809 --> 00:53:32.819 align:start position:0%
improve for example our procurement
 
00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
system so if you're a business in a
 
00:53:38.210 --> 00:53:38.220 align:start position:0%
certain line of uh in a certain sector
 
00:53:40.490 --> 00:53:40.500 align:start position:0%
and there are State contracts that are
 
00:53:43.250 --> 00:53:43.260 align:start position:0%
being offered within that period you
 
00:53:46.549 --> 00:53:46.559 align:start position:0%
would have notifications when those rfps
 
00:53:49.370 --> 00:53:49.380 align:start position:0%
are issued so those are the sorts of
 
00:53:51.589 --> 00:53:51.599 align:start position:0%
functionalities that we're working
 
00:53:54.109 --> 00:53:54.119 align:start position:0%
towards and and the type of
 
00:53:55.910 --> 00:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
functionality that we're hoping to be
 
00:53:59.630 --> 00:53:59.640 align:start position:0%
able to accomplish in a period that is
 
00:54:02.930 --> 00:54:02.940 align:start position:0%
not going to exceed 18 months is is to
 
00:54:07.549 --> 00:54:07.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:09.230 --> 00:54:09.240 align:start position:0%
and when would you expect phase one to
 
00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:10.609 align:start position:0%
and when would you expect phase one to
start

00:54:10.609 --> 00:54:10.619 align:start position:0%
start
 
00:54:13.549 --> 00:54:13.559 align:start position:0%
uh probably as soon as we have all of
 
00:54:15.829 --> 00:54:15.839 align:start position:0%
our final approvals in place so we'll
 
00:54:17.690 --> 00:54:17.700 align:start position:0%
come from here and we'll go to Governor
 
00:54:21.530 --> 00:54:21.540 align:start position:0%
Council on May 31st I believe is the is
 
00:54:23.630 --> 00:54:23.640 align:start position:0%
their next meeting so at that point
 
00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
shortly thereafter if is you know as I
 
00:54:27.950 --> 00:54:27.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned to Senator Rosenwald were able
 
00:54:29.150 --> 00:54:29.160 align:start position:0%
to continue the relationship with the
 
00:54:31.970 --> 00:54:31.980 align:start position:0%
vendor we would start immediately
 
00:54:36.049 --> 00:54:36.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:38.450 --> 00:54:38.460 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the item I'll move
 
00:54:42.650 --> 00:54:42.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:44.990 --> 00:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley moves the item
 
00:54:48.950 --> 00:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
and Senator gray seconds for item
 
00:54:53.450 --> 00:54:53.460 align:start position:0%
22 150 uh you know 20
 
00:54:58.549 --> 00:54:58.559 align:start position:0%
23 146. further discussion and let me
 
00:54:59.750 --> 00:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
note that
 
00:55:02.089 --> 00:55:02.099 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin is now the fifth
 
00:55:04.390 --> 00:55:04.400 align:start position:0%
vote on the house side replacing
 
00:55:07.609 --> 00:55:07.619 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards
 
00:55:11.329 --> 00:55:11.339 align:start position:0%
all in favor say aye aye opposed no
 
00:55:14.809 --> 00:55:14.819 align:start position:0%
motion is adopted move lastly to
 
00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:16.730 align:start position:0%
item 23169
 
00:55:16.730 --> 00:55:18.109 align:start position:0%
item 23169
[Music]

00:55:18.109 --> 00:55:18.119 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:55:21.650 --> 00:55:21.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:24.290 --> 00:55:24.300 align:start position:0%
a governor's office of emergency is
 
00:55:26.569 --> 00:55:26.579 align:start position:0%
going to move to C
 
00:55:29.569 --> 00:55:29.579 align:start position:0%
emergency relief and Recovery
 
00:55:33.530 --> 00:55:33.540 align:start position:0%
and that was a request by Senator
 
00:55:33.540 --> 00:55:35.510 align:start position:0%
and that was a request by Senator
Rosenwald

00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
Rosenwald
 
00:55:38.809 --> 00:55:38.819 align:start position:0%
that was mine thank you
 
00:55:38.819 --> 00:55:40.250 align:start position:0%
that was mine thank you
um

00:55:40.250 --> 00:55:40.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:42.589 --> 00:55:42.599 align:start position:0%
so I
 
00:55:46.430 --> 00:55:46.440 align:start position:0%
understand that we're getting
 
00:55:50.690 --> 00:55:50.700 align:start position:0%
uh nine million dollars more of e-wrap
 
00:55:50.700 --> 00:55:52.010 align:start position:0%
uh nine million dollars more of e-wrap
funds

00:55:52.010 --> 00:55:52.020 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:55:55.250 --> 00:55:55.260 align:start position:0%
that are federal delegation was able to
 
00:55:55.260 --> 00:55:56.450 align:start position:0%
that are federal delegation was able to
secure

00:55:56.450 --> 00:55:56.460 align:start position:0%
secure
 
00:55:58.730 --> 00:55:58.740 align:start position:0%
am I correct that
 
00:56:02.809 --> 00:56:02.819 align:start position:0%
we had to return almost 19 million
 
00:56:02.819 --> 00:56:03.890 align:start position:0%
we had to return almost 19 million
dollars

00:56:03.890 --> 00:56:03.900 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:56:07.730 --> 00:56:07.740 align:start position:0%
of Europe One funds
 
00:56:09.530 --> 00:56:09.540 align:start position:0%
Sandra good question Chase Hageman
 
00:56:11.270 --> 00:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
Deputy over at gopher
 
00:56:12.950 --> 00:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
um yes it's accurate a little less than
 
00:56:16.549 --> 00:56:16.559 align:start position:0%
19 million was returned under era one uh
 
00:56:19.490 --> 00:56:19.500 align:start position:0%
this is era2 but also under era1 there
 
00:56:21.410 --> 00:56:21.420 align:start position:0%
was a reallocation process much like
 
00:56:23.870 --> 00:56:23.880 align:start position:0%
this one where the state received about
 
00:56:25.910 --> 00:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
I think between 12 and 15 million
 
00:56:29.150 --> 00:56:29.160 align:start position:0%
dollars back of basically what had been
 
00:56:32.030 --> 00:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
clawed back from it and then under this
 
00:56:34.490 --> 00:56:34.500 align:start position:0%
process this 9 million is being sent to
 
00:56:36.650 --> 00:56:36.660 align:start position:0%
the state also part of the reallocation
 
00:56:39.349 --> 00:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
process under era2 so the state had
 
00:56:41.870 --> 00:56:41.880 align:start position:0%
applied for about 44 million dollars
 
00:56:44.510 --> 00:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
last October and this is the amount that
 
00:56:46.670 --> 00:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
was sent to us
 
00:56:51.710 --> 00:56:51.720 align:start position:0%
thank you so this is going to the half
 
00:56:54.710 --> 00:56:54.720 align:start position:0%
of it about it's going to the affordable
 
00:56:59.210 --> 00:56:59.220 align:start position:0%
housing fund is that going to support
 
00:57:03.290 --> 00:57:03.300 align:start position:0%
only affordable housing and what is the
 
00:57:05.930 --> 00:57:05.940 align:start position:0%
period of affordability that will be
 
00:57:09.710 --> 00:57:09.720 align:start position:0%
required so that amount uh yes we would
 
00:57:11.329 --> 00:57:11.339 align:start position:0%
transfer that to New Hampshire housing
 
00:57:13.970 --> 00:57:13.980 align:start position:0%
who administers the affordable housing
 
00:57:17.170 --> 00:57:17.180 align:start position:0%
fund uh all of the funds would be used
 
00:57:20.630 --> 00:57:20.640 align:start position:0%
in accordance with the rules for their
 
00:57:22.309 --> 00:57:22.319 align:start position:0%
affordable housing fund which I believe
 
00:57:25.609 --> 00:57:25.619 align:start position:0%
is an affordability at 50 percent of Ami
 
00:57:27.049 --> 00:57:27.059 align:start position:0%
or below
 
00:57:29.089 --> 00:57:29.099 align:start position:0%
for how long
 
00:57:31.849 --> 00:57:31.859 align:start position:0%
I think I do you know the answer to I
 
00:57:33.770 --> 00:57:33.780 align:start position:0%
mean I think it's individual based it
 
00:57:35.569 --> 00:57:35.579 align:start position:0%
depends on the program so they use those
 
00:57:40.089 --> 00:57:40.099 align:start position:0%
funds in in it for example to to to
 
00:57:42.230 --> 00:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
subsidize programs under the low income
 
00:57:44.450 --> 00:57:44.460 align:start position:0%
housing tax credit program or under
 
00:57:46.549 --> 00:57:46.559 align:start position:0%
other programs that they administer and
 
00:57:49.609 --> 00:57:49.619 align:start position:0%
those all may have different types of
 
00:57:52.549 --> 00:57:52.559 align:start position:0%
affordability restrictions and times but
 
00:57:55.609 --> 00:57:55.619 align:start position:0%
I can say pretty
 
00:57:58.010 --> 00:57:58.020 align:start position:0%
um with a lot of confidence that all of
 
00:58:00.309 --> 00:58:00.319 align:start position:0%
the programs that New Hampshire housing
 
00:58:04.190 --> 00:58:04.200 align:start position:0%
administers have significant time frames
 
00:58:07.130 --> 00:58:07.140 align:start position:0%
for the affordability requirement and in
 
00:58:10.250 --> 00:58:10.260 align:start position:0%
in some cases it's 90 years okay thank

foreign

01:01:48.309 --> 01:01:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:51.950 --> 01:01:51.960 align:start position:0%
we are requesting to reallocate arpa
 
01:01:55.130 --> 01:01:55.140 align:start position:0%
funds that were previously approved for
 
01:01:58.010 --> 01:01:58.020 align:start position:0%
another purpose the reason that we're
 
01:02:00.230 --> 01:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
requesting to reallocate these funds
 
01:02:03.049 --> 01:02:03.059 align:start position:0%
they have approximately four 4. million
 
01:02:05.690 --> 01:02:05.700 align:start position:0%
dollars is the department
 
01:02:08.089 --> 01:02:08.099 align:start position:0%
um over the over the past period of time
 
01:02:11.390 --> 01:02:11.400 align:start position:0%
has been working with Das and an
 
01:02:13.549 --> 01:02:13.559 align:start position:0%
architect to design the forensic
 
01:02:13.559 --> 01:02:15.170 align:start position:0%
architect to design the forensic
facility

01:02:15.170 --> 01:02:15.180 align:start position:0%
facility
 
01:02:18.289 --> 01:02:18.299 align:start position:0%
um that that design was finalized and
 
01:02:21.470 --> 01:02:21.480 align:start position:0%
the bid was put out by Public Works two
 
01:02:25.190 --> 01:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
bids came back it's a request for bid so
 
01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
in that case if they meet the bare
 
01:02:28.130 --> 01:02:28.140 align:start position:0%
minimum qualifications and they have the
 
01:02:30.829 --> 01:02:30.839 align:start position:0%
lowest bid then they are awarded the the
 
01:02:34.370 --> 01:02:34.380 align:start position:0%
winner under under state law and the bit
 
01:02:36.589 --> 01:02:36.599 align:start position:0%
the bid amount that came back was higher
 
01:02:39.710 --> 01:02:39.720 align:start position:0%
than what was originally anticipated
 
01:02:41.690 --> 01:02:41.700 align:start position:0%
um the the commissioner from the
 
01:02:43.130 --> 01:02:43.140 align:start position:0%
Department administrative Services is
 
01:02:46.730 --> 01:02:46.740 align:start position:0%
here but as as many of us are are well
 
01:02:49.730 --> 01:02:49.740 align:start position:0%
aware the the construction industry has
 
01:02:53.630 --> 01:02:53.640 align:start position:0%
seen year over year cost increases and
 
01:02:55.549 --> 01:02:55.559 align:start position:0%
that's the reason why it's one of the
 
01:02:58.549 --> 01:02:58.559 align:start position:0%
key reasons why the bid came in higher
 
01:03:00.470 --> 01:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
than previously anticipated when this
 
01:03:05.030 --> 01:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:06.770 --> 01:03:06.780 align:start position:0%
and where did the funds the four million
 
01:03:08.089 --> 01:03:08.099 align:start position:0%
dollars come from
 
01:03:11.150 --> 01:03:11.160 align:start position:0%
sure so
 
01:03:13.190 --> 01:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
the department previously put an item
 
01:03:15.230 --> 01:03:15.240 align:start position:0%
forward I believe it was in December of
 
01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:17.089 align:start position:0%
forward I believe it was in December of
2021.

01:03:17.089 --> 01:03:17.099 align:start position:0%
2021.
 
01:03:19.789 --> 01:03:19.799 align:start position:0%
um this was a point in time when we were
 
01:03:23.329 --> 01:03:23.339 align:start position:0%
seeing a significant increase in uh
 
01:03:24.890 --> 01:03:24.900 align:start position:0%
individuals being admitted to the
 
01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:25.809 align:start position:0%
individuals being admitted to the
hospital

01:03:25.809 --> 01:03:25.819 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
01:03:29.349 --> 01:03:29.359 align:start position:0%
at that time an executive order
 
01:03:32.030 --> 01:03:32.040 align:start position:0%
2021-12 was issued which directed the
 
01:03:33.710 --> 01:03:33.720 align:start position:0%
department to take all steps and
 
01:03:36.349 --> 01:03:36.359 align:start position:0%
measures necessary to try to mitigate
 
01:03:37.910 --> 01:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
the number of individuals that were in
 
01:03:39.530 --> 01:03:39.540 align:start position:0%
the hospital open up those beds for
 
01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:41.049 align:start position:0%
the hospital open up those beds for
individuals

01:03:41.049 --> 01:03:41.059 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
01:03:44.270 --> 01:03:44.280 align:start position:0%
we had set aside approximately nine
 
01:03:46.370 --> 01:03:46.380 align:start position:0%
million dollars for ambulatory surgical
 
01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:47.770 align:start position:0%
million dollars for ambulatory surgical
centers

01:03:47.770 --> 01:03:47.780 align:start position:0%
centers
 
01:03:50.750 --> 01:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
to take individuals from the hospital
 
01:03:53.510 --> 01:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
and to be able to reimburse them for any
 
01:03:55.069 --> 01:03:55.079 align:start position:0%
potential costs that they would incur
 
01:03:56.809 --> 01:03:56.819 align:start position:0%
that that weren't covered by third party
 
01:03:59.329 --> 01:03:59.339 align:start position:0%
insurance or Medicaid the department was
 
01:04:00.890 --> 01:04:00.900 align:start position:0%
able to
 
01:04:03.170 --> 01:04:03.180 align:start position:0%
um to move individuals to other facility
 
01:04:06.109 --> 01:04:06.119 align:start position:0%
types and these funds ended up not being
 
01:04:08.450 --> 01:04:08.460 align:start position:0%
needed for that purpose and so they were
 
01:04:11.089 --> 01:04:11.099 align:start position:0%
available and so when we were looking at
 
01:04:13.430 --> 01:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
the ARP carry four dollars that you saw
 
01:04:18.770 --> 01:04:18.780 align:start position:0%
on fist 165 and 16667 we identify these
 
01:04:19.990 --> 01:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
as available
 
01:04:22.670 --> 01:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
for potentially if with your approval
 
01:04:24.230 --> 01:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of funding the forensic
 
01:04:27.230 --> 01:04:27.240 align:start position:0%
facility hospital Construction
 
01:04:30.710 --> 01:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
one more and when do you expect to start
 
01:04:33.650 --> 01:04:33.660 align:start position:0%
construction and finish Construction
 
01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
Lori Weaver interim commissioner HHS
 
01:04:39.829 --> 01:04:39.839 align:start position:0%
construction once the bid is awarded
 
01:04:41.630 --> 01:04:41.640 align:start position:0%
we'll start as soon as the bid is
 
01:04:44.329 --> 01:04:44.339 align:start position:0%
awarded and anticipated timelines there
 
01:04:45.849 --> 01:04:45.859 align:start position:0%
are a lot of things that need to happen
 
01:04:48.770 --> 01:04:48.780 align:start position:0%
uh right now we're looking at Finish
 
01:04:51.109 --> 01:04:51.119 align:start position:0%
starting right away and finishing
 
01:04:52.670 --> 01:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
sometime around the beginning of early
 
01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:54.770 align:start position:0%
sometime around the beginning of early
25.

01:04:54.770 --> 01:04:54.780 align:start position:0%
25.
 
01:04:57.829 --> 01:04:57.839 align:start position:0%

01:05:10.250 --> 01:05:10.260 align:start position:0%
have a projection of the operating costs
 
01:05:13.250 --> 01:05:13.260 align:start position:0%
that we'll see that I guess will occur
 
01:05:18.130 --> 01:05:18.140 align:start position:0%
during the upcoming biennium
 
01:05:23.630 --> 01:05:23.640 align:start position:0%
sure so the in the agency request in the
 
01:05:25.190 --> 01:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
state fiscal for the state fiscal year
 
01:05:28.970 --> 01:05:28.980 align:start position:0%
26 27 budget you will see our our
 
01:05:30.770 --> 01:05:30.780 align:start position:0%
request for that
 
01:05:33.530 --> 01:05:33.540 align:start position:0%
um when we initially looked at the
 
01:05:35.930 --> 01:05:35.940 align:start position:0%
potential cost there for this prior
 
01:05:38.150 --> 01:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
budget we were hoping that that the
 
01:05:40.430 --> 01:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
hospital may be open by that point
 
01:05:42.289 --> 01:05:42.299 align:start position:0%
um but but it will not be variety of
 
01:05:42.299 --> 01:05:43.609 align:start position:0%
um but but it will not be variety of
factors

01:05:43.609 --> 01:05:43.619 align:start position:0%
factors
 
01:05:45.470 --> 01:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
um we do anticipate somewhere in the
 
01:05:47.690 --> 01:05:47.700 align:start position:0%
vicinity of 20 million dollars but I
 
01:05:50.089 --> 01:05:50.099 align:start position:0%
think it's too early to tell
 
01:05:52.309 --> 01:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
um I think initial if I recall initial
 
01:05:54.470 --> 01:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
staff estimates were somewhere in the
 
01:05:57.170 --> 01:05:57.180 align:start position:0%
vicinity of 165 but again it's a 24-hour
 
01:06:00.289 --> 01:06:00.299 align:start position:0%
facility there may be contracted costs
 
01:06:03.170 --> 01:06:03.180 align:start position:0%
depending on how how we staff the
 
01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
facility and what the specific needs are
 
01:06:09.230 --> 01:06:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:12.109 --> 01:06:12.119 align:start position:0%
a year 20 million dollars per year
 
01:06:14.809 --> 01:06:14.819 align:start position:0%
likely a vast majority of that being
 
01:06:17.089 --> 01:06:17.099 align:start position:0%
General funds we are investigating other
 
01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
options to see if there are federal
 
01:06:21.589 --> 01:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
dollars available to leverage the
 
01:06:25.910 --> 01:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
department has already started a a
 
01:06:27.829 --> 01:06:27.839 align:start position:0%
project team on this with a project
 
01:06:31.309 --> 01:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
manager much of the work for opening
 
01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
um is is being looked at now what
 
01:06:35.329 --> 01:06:35.339 align:start position:0%
contracts will we need to go into effect
 
01:06:37.609 --> 01:06:37.619 align:start position:0%
prior to opening what does the staff
 
01:06:39.049 --> 01:06:39.059 align:start position:0%
onboarding look like what are the
 
01:06:41.510 --> 01:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
policies and procedures that we need to
 
01:06:43.430 --> 01:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
develop in advance and this work is
 
01:06:45.529 --> 01:06:45.539 align:start position:0%
actively under development and you will
 
01:06:46.910 --> 01:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
see the requests come through in the
 
01:06:50.270 --> 01:06:50.280 align:start position:0%
2627 budget just one more Effect one
 
01:06:52.609 --> 01:06:52.619 align:start position:0%
more I think I heard the commissioner
 
01:06:59.029 --> 01:06:59.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:01.309 --> 01:07:01.319 align:start position:0%
so don't
 
01:07:04.250 --> 01:07:04.260 align:start position:0%
will we not need
 
01:07:07.910 --> 01:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:10.250 --> 01:07:10.260 align:start position:0%
we will need a budget we will have to
 
01:07:11.930 --> 01:07:11.940 align:start position:0%
start to recruit if we open at the
 
01:07:14.089 --> 01:07:14.099 align:start position:0%
beginning of 25 and it has a potential
 
01:07:16.490 --> 01:07:16.500 align:start position:0%
opening of July 1st of that year we'll
 
01:07:18.770 --> 01:07:18.780 align:start position:0%
be working to recruit then and looking
 
01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
at the operating budget for the next the
 
01:07:24.410 --> 01:07:24.420 align:start position:0%
following biennium explain him
 
01:07:27.770 --> 01:07:27.780 align:start position:0%
um yes and and and and I believe
 
01:07:29.450 --> 01:07:29.460 align:start position:0%
um what what we're looking at to the
 
01:07:32.089 --> 01:07:32.099 align:start position:0%
final construction to be somewhere in in
 
01:07:35.270 --> 01:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
mid mid 2025 which which would be into
 
01:07:38.390 --> 01:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
State fiscal year 26 just to clarify yes

01:11:25.729 --> 01:11:25.739 align:start position:0%
Senator thank you so that it seems like
 
01:11:28.729 --> 01:11:28.739 align:start position:0%
for the current fiscal year or or like
 
01:11:30.770 --> 01:11:30.780 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry the biennium
 
01:11:32.570 --> 01:11:32.580 align:start position:0%
which is ending
 
01:11:37.790 --> 01:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:42.169 --> 01:11:42.179 align:start position:0%
um 17 and a half million dollars about
 
01:11:44.689 --> 01:11:44.699 align:start position:0%
for the Governor's Commission
 
01:11:50.510 --> 01:11:50.520 align:start position:0%
but what is obligated but not yet spent
 
01:11:55.910 --> 01:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
is not is almost 10 million dollars
 
01:11:59.510 --> 01:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
and they're only six weeks left so do
 
01:12:02.330 --> 01:12:02.340 align:start position:0%
all those bills come in
 
01:12:05.390 --> 01:12:05.400 align:start position:0%
after the close of the biennium because
 
01:12:07.729 --> 01:12:07.739 align:start position:0%
these funds thus I understand that are
 
01:12:07.739 --> 01:12:09.850 align:start position:0%
these funds thus I understand that are
obligated

01:12:09.850 --> 01:12:09.860 align:start position:0%
obligated
 
01:12:14.510 --> 01:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
contract in an obligated but more than
 
01:12:17.050 --> 01:12:17.060 align:start position:0%
half of the biennium
 
01:12:20.689 --> 01:12:20.699 align:start position:0%
spend has not yet been spent
 
01:12:23.630 --> 01:12:23.640 align:start position:0%
with only six weeks left sure and and I
 
01:12:25.370 --> 01:12:25.380 align:start position:0%
I apologize just to clarify what
 
01:12:26.870 --> 01:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
document are you looking at it's it's
 
01:12:29.330 --> 01:12:29.340 align:start position:0%
not clear to me I believe it's tab 15 of
 
01:12:31.550 --> 01:12:31.560 align:start position:0%
the spreadsheet you sent us
 
01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:33.350 align:start position:0%
the spreadsheet you sent us
um

01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:36.229 --> 01:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
I think it's cynics from a spreadsheet
 
01:12:38.570 --> 01:12:38.580 align:start position:0%
that the department
 
01:12:42.470 --> 01:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
sent an Excel form but
 
01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:43.970 align:start position:0%
sent an Excel form but
yes

01:12:43.970 --> 01:12:43.980 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:12:43.980 --> 01:12:45.709 align:start position:0%
yes
there's

01:12:45.709 --> 01:12:45.719 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:12:49.010 --> 01:12:49.020 align:start position:0%
LBA put it into a different look no it
 
01:12:52.250 --> 01:12:52.260 align:start position:0%
looks it looks just like that oh okay
 
01:12:55.610 --> 01:12:55.620 align:start position:0%
LBA printed it and put it on my desk
 
01:12:58.430 --> 01:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
that was nice of them very nice so
 
01:13:00.649 --> 01:13:00.659 align:start position:0%
there's this nice blue line well there
 
01:13:04.130 --> 01:13:04.140 align:start position:0%
it is very nice blue line
 
01:13:08.030 --> 01:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
and I'm looking at the top third where
 
01:13:11.149 --> 01:13:11.159 align:start position:0%
the governor's commission had 17.6
 
01:13:13.310 --> 01:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
01:13:16.669 --> 01:13:16.679 align:start position:0%
for the biennium but what's contracted
 
01:13:19.370 --> 01:13:19.380 align:start position:0%
but still unspent
 
01:13:23.390 --> 01:13:23.400 align:start position:0%
as we're almost at the end is just under
 
01:13:25.090 --> 01:13:25.100 align:start position:0%
10 million
 
01:13:27.410 --> 01:13:27.420 align:start position:0%
sure so
 
01:13:27.420 --> 01:13:28.729 align:start position:0%
sure so
um

01:13:28.729 --> 01:13:28.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:31.790 --> 01:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
the way that
 
01:13:34.610 --> 01:13:34.620 align:start position:0%
where to start so the governor's
 
01:13:36.410 --> 01:13:36.420 align:start position:0%
commission uh the funding appropriated
 
01:13:38.209 --> 01:13:38.219 align:start position:0%
to them is continually appropriated and
 
01:13:38.219 --> 01:13:39.430 align:start position:0%
to them is continually appropriated and
non-lapsing

01:13:39.430 --> 01:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing
 
01:13:43.550 --> 01:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
if we have a contract that's encumbered
 
01:13:45.530 --> 01:13:45.540 align:start position:0%
um those those funds would carry forward
 
01:13:47.390 --> 01:13:47.400 align:start position:0%
into the next biennium if they weren't
 
01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:48.470 align:start position:0%
into the next biennium if they weren't
spent

01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
spent
 
01:13:50.990 --> 01:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
um so when when we enter into a contract
 
01:13:52.970 --> 01:13:52.980 align:start position:0%
we may enter that you know six months
 
01:13:54.590 --> 01:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
into the year something on loans those
 
01:13:57.229 --> 01:13:57.239 align:start position:0%
lines maybe a year it could be a two or
 
01:13:59.290 --> 01:13:59.300 align:start position:0%
three year contract there could also be
 
01:14:01.310 --> 01:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
amendments associated with these
 
01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:02.750 align:start position:0%
amendments associated with these
contracts

01:14:02.750 --> 01:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
contracts
 
01:14:05.510 --> 01:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
um June the to governor and executive
 
01:14:07.250 --> 01:14:07.260 align:start position:0%
Council meetings in June we typically
 
01:14:10.669 --> 01:14:10.679 align:start position:0%
send through several hundred uh
 
01:14:12.770 --> 01:14:12.780 align:start position:0%
amendments and contracts during that
 
01:14:14.149 --> 01:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
period of time
 
01:14:16.189 --> 01:14:16.199 align:start position:0%
um we we do about 800 Amendment
 
01:14:17.990 --> 01:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
contracts annually typically the May
 
01:14:21.050 --> 01:14:21.060 align:start position:0%
June months are when you do see a
 
01:14:23.390 --> 01:14:23.400 align:start position:0%
significant amount of volume occur at
 
01:14:27.770 --> 01:14:27.780 align:start position:0%
GNC and and so while this may show up
 
01:14:30.290 --> 01:14:30.300 align:start position:0%
like this what will happen in the next
 
01:14:32.450 --> 01:14:32.460 align:start position:0%
several weeks will probably produce a
 
01:14:33.590 --> 01:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
very different result than what you're
 
01:14:35.030 --> 01:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
looking at there
 
01:14:37.669 --> 01:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
thanks could could we just ask that you
 
01:14:41.630 --> 01:14:41.640 align:start position:0%
share the updated result with us
 
01:14:44.689 --> 01:14:44.699 align:start position:0%
sure for in in state fiscal year 24 so
 
01:14:46.070 --> 01:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
for the July meeting
 
01:14:47.630 --> 01:14:47.640 align:start position:0%
which is when you would see the
 
01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:48.310 align:start position:0%
which is when you would see the
difference

01:14:48.310 --> 01:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
difference
 
01:14:54.050 --> 01:14:54.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:56.450 --> 01:14:56.460 align:start position:0%
that's just an informational item so we
 
01:14:58.490 --> 01:14:58.500 align:start position:0%
don't need a motion on it
 
01:15:01.850 --> 01:15:01.860 align:start position:0%
so we come down to the date and time of
 
01:15:03.950 --> 01:15:03.960 align:start position:0%
the next meeting for the fiscal
 
01:15:06.530 --> 01:15:06.540 align:start position:0%
committee uh there's been a suggestion
 
01:15:14.570 --> 01:15:14.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:18.169 --> 01:15:18.179 align:start position:0%
because of conflicts on on the 16th
 
01:15:18.179 --> 01:15:23.870 align:start position:0%
because of conflicts on on the 16th
likely

01:15:23.870 --> 01:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:25.850 --> 01:15:25.860 align:start position:0%
is that is that a problem with any of
 
01:15:30.290 --> 01:15:30.300 align:start position:0%
your schedules uh I had the UNH Board of
 
01:15:33.290 --> 01:15:33.300 align:start position:0%
Trustees that day so that's a whole day
 
01:15:36.350 --> 01:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
thing it's the morning thing
 
01:15:38.510 --> 01:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
it looks like Health and Human Services
 
01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:40.490 align:start position:0%
it looks like Health and Human Services
oversight

01:15:40.490 --> 01:15:40.500 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
01:15:43.370 --> 01:15:43.380 align:start position:0%
also is that morning
 
01:15:48.290 --> 01:15:48.300 align:start position:0%
I missed that because of this so yeah I
 
01:15:53.770 --> 01:15:53.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:56.570 --> 01:15:56.580 align:start position:0%
that's the beginning of the COC week
 
01:15:58.790 --> 01:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
the following the earlier Friday is the
 
01:15:59.510 --> 01:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
beginning of the committee of
 
01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:02.110 align:start position:0%
beginning of the committee of
conferences

01:16:02.110 --> 01:16:02.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:05.510 --> 01:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
I mean I think anything while we're
 
01:16:08.510 --> 01:16:08.520 align:start position:0%
potentially committees I think we've had
 
01:16:10.610 --> 01:16:10.620 align:start position:0%
two okay so starting at one o'clock on
 
01:16:14.870 --> 01:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:15.790 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:16:15.790 --> 01:16:15.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:16:18.530 --> 01:16:18.540 align:start position:0%
