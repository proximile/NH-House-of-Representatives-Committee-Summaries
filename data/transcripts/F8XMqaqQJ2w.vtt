00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
well thank you thank you very much thank
 
00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:38.720 align:start position:0%
you very much mr chair so i'm president
 
00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
timothy horrigan so i'm on um
 
00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
so i wanted to speak up for the vaccines
 
00:13:46.629 --> 00:13:46.639 align:start position:0%
i mean i realize
 
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
not everyone can take them not everyone
 
00:13:51.189 --> 00:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
will want to take them but i think um
 
00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
something has been very much lost in the
 
00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
debate ironically is the fact that the
 
00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
virus is extremely dangerous vastly more
 
00:13:59.670 --> 00:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
dangerous than the
 
00:14:02.069 --> 00:14:02.079 align:start position:0%
than the vaccines they're not 100 safe
 
00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
but nothing in life is 100 safe but if
 
00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
we'd um
 
00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
if we hadn't developed the vaccines if
 
00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
we hadn't taken
 
00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
the various emergency measures which i
 
00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
think should have been tougher
 
00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
we would have
 
00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
we would have lost even more people than
 
00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
we did and as it is this is the uh
 
00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
biggest catastrophe in terms of numbers
 
00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:26.240 align:start position:0%
killed since the civil war um and so one
 
00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
even though we're sort of in denial
 
00:14:31.269 --> 00:14:31.279 align:start position:0%
about it it's a
 
00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
it's a major catastrophe worldwide and i
 
00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.750 align:start position:0%
it's a major catastrophe worldwide and i
happen

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
happen
 
00:14:37.269 --> 00:14:37.279 align:start position:0%
i i
 
00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
i happen to represent durham which has a
 
00:14:40.949 --> 00:14:40.959 align:start position:0%
number of uh
 
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
a number of uh
 
00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
chinese residents from from china
 
00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
because of uh they're studying at unh
 
00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:48.720 align:start position:0%
and they um
 
00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
their country took it
 
00:14:52.069 --> 00:14:52.079 align:start position:0%
much more seriously i mean they're very
 
00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
different from us and it's an impressive
 
00:14:55.189 --> 00:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
country i don't want to live there but
 
00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
they uh you know they were very
 
00:14:59.509 --> 00:14:59.519 align:start position:0%
aggressive about and what they did uh
 
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
whatever else you might think about the
 
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
way they do things it was uh if
 
00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
it worked you know like which is you
 
00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.430 align:start position:0%
it worked you know like which is you
know

00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
you know nearly universal testing and um
 
00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
and rolling out the vaccines quickly and
 
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
stuff so
 
00:15:13.829 --> 00:15:13.839 align:start position:0%
i have
 
00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
i have several
 
00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
bills i guess you could describe as
 
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
pro-vaccine bills um there's
 
00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
um two bills about the medical
 
00:15:25.829 --> 00:15:25.839 align:start position:0%
freedom and immunizations act i think
 
00:15:27.269 --> 00:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
which one
 
00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:28.720 align:start position:0%
which i'm just co-sponsoring with a
 
00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
member from keane which just carves out
 
00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:31.509 align:start position:0%
member from keane which just carves out
a

00:15:31.509 --> 00:15:31.519 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:15:31.519 --> 00:15:32.470 align:start position:0%
a
was

00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:15:33.749 --> 00:15:33.759 align:start position:0%
there's several exemptions already
 
00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:36.160 align:start position:0%
carved out so now it also says that
 
00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:37.910 align:start position:0%
carved out so now it also says that
college

00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
college
 
00:15:40.949 --> 00:15:40.959 align:start position:0%
that colleges and universities are also
 
00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
exempt from that from that law so they
 
00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
can require vaccines if they want to and
 
00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:46.870 align:start position:0%
can require vaccines if they want to and
the

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
private institutions i believe have
 
00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
all required vaccines unh
 
00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
because of the federal contractor is
 
00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
going along voluntarily they think it's
 
00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:00.160 align:start position:0%
a good idea as far as i can tell
 
00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
with uh getting universal vaccine or or
 
00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:04.069 align:start position:0%
with uh getting universal vaccine or or
testing

00:16:04.069 --> 00:16:04.079 align:start position:0%
testing
 
00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
i've also
 
00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
also got one i also have a bill in there
 
00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:11.509 align:start position:0%
also got one i also have a bill in there
which

00:16:11.509 --> 00:16:11.519 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
which says that employers cannot forbid
 
00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
employees from getting
 
00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and i don't
 
00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
know of any cases where employers have
 
00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:22.160 align:start position:0%
tried to forbid employees from getting
 
00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
vaccinated but i do know
 
00:16:26.949 --> 00:16:26.959 align:start position:0%
i do know for them there was a private
 
00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
school in florida that got a lot of uh
 
00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
they got a lot of attention for firing
 
00:16:34.829 --> 00:16:34.839 align:start position:0%
all its vaccinated faculty members and
 
00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:38.240 align:start position:0%
um getting rid of his facul the
 
00:16:39.509 --> 00:16:39.519 align:start position:0%
vaccinated students because they
 
00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
believed incorrectly that
 
00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:44.320 align:start position:0%
getting vaccinated made you more
 
00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
dangerous to those around you which is
 
00:16:48.069 --> 00:16:48.079 align:start position:0%
you know exactly the opposite of the
 
00:16:51.749 --> 00:16:51.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
and then um i also want to mention
 
00:16:59.350 --> 00:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
something that i worked on years ago
 
00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
which is somewhat
 
00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:03.680 align:start position:0%
tangentially related but it was the bill
 
00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:05.110 align:start position:0%
tangentially related but it was the bill
about

00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:17:07.189 --> 00:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
buffer zones around
 
00:17:09.429 --> 00:17:09.439 align:start position:0%
reproductive health facilities and i
 
00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
remember the time i was aware that
 
00:17:13.909 --> 00:17:13.919 align:start position:0%
there were some religious groups who
 
00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
objected to
 
00:17:18.309 --> 00:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
vaccinations and i had heard from you
 
00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
know we've had the anti-vaxxers who
 
00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
believe also incorrectly there's mercury
 
00:17:23.029 --> 00:17:23.039 align:start position:0%
and other dangerous things in the
 
00:17:23.039 --> 00:17:24.630 align:start position:0%
and other dangerous things in the
vaccines

00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:24.640 align:start position:0%
vaccines
 
00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:25.750 align:start position:0%
vaccines
um

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:27.429 --> 00:17:27.439 align:start position:0%
and i did uh
 
00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
i did ask reproductive health clinics
 
00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
and also then other health if they ever
 
00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:33.440 align:start position:0%
had any trouble problem with people
 
00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
picketing or interfering with other
 
00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:38.720 align:start position:0%
with vaccinations also some religious
 
00:17:39.669 --> 00:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
groups are also against blood
 
00:17:41.669 --> 00:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
transfusions they said
 
00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
they'd never had any problems until the
 
00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
covet vaccine um
 
00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:48.640 align:start position:0%
the coveted vaccine
 
00:17:51.909 --> 00:17:51.919 align:start position:0%
so covet 19 came along there wasn't
 
00:17:54.549 --> 00:17:54.559 align:start position:0%
there wasn't this vast
 
00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:56.240 align:start position:0%
public outcry there weren't large
 
00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
numbers of religious groups who opposed
 
00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
vaccinations so somehow
 
00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
and i don't really know the answer to it
 
00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:04.720 align:start position:0%
somehow i think a lot of people i think
 
00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
somehow this has become uh
 
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
at least
 
00:18:10.789 --> 00:18:10.799 align:start position:0%
at least a position that's
 
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
taken a lot gotten a lot of attention
 
00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure how many how many people
 
00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:16.630 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure how many how many people
actually

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:18.160 align:start position:0%
follow it because the vast majority of
 
00:18:20.549 --> 00:18:20.559 align:start position:0%
people i think are quietly
 
00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
taking the precautions they need to
 
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
protect themselves against the pandemic
 
00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:26.720 align:start position:0%
including being vaccinated but
 
00:18:28.789 --> 00:18:28.799 align:start position:0%
back then back then when we when we
 
00:18:30.789 --> 00:18:30.799 align:start position:0%
passed that law
 
00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:32.240 align:start position:0%
um there was
 
00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
you know we i did we did ask whether
 
00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
there was any need for put vex you know
 
00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
vaccine clinics in there and they said
 
00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
no no no there's never been any problems
 
00:18:43.909 --> 00:18:43.919 align:start position:0%
so there's a now that there is a problem
 
00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
you may want to consider
 
00:18:48.549 --> 00:18:48.559 align:start position:0%
enacting a similar
 
00:18:50.789 --> 00:18:50.799 align:start position:0%
assumer protection for vaccine clinics i
 
00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
know they've had some problems in
 
00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
california with
 
00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:54.950 align:start position:0%
california with
people

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
with protesters trying to block um
 
00:18:59.430 --> 00:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
people from getting vaccines and and
 
00:19:00.549 --> 00:19:00.559 align:start position:0%
tests so
 
00:19:00.559 --> 00:19:02.230 align:start position:0%
tests so
um

00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:02.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
anyway so i guess i'll just close by
 
00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
saying that there is a i think the
 
00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
majority people are in favor of the
 
00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
vaccines they
 
00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
want as many of their neighbors to be
 
00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:12.470 align:start position:0%
want as many of their neighbors to be
vaccinated

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
vaccinated
 
00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
most people
 
00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
most people
 
00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
are very afraid of covid they know how
 
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
dangerous it is and
 
00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
they also know that
 
00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
the vaccines and the
 
00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
other uh
 
00:19:25.669 --> 00:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
and the other precautions we've been
 
00:19:25.679 --> 00:19:26.870 align:start position:0%
and the other precautions we've been
taking

00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
taking
 
00:19:28.789 --> 00:19:28.799 align:start position:0%
are necessary and are effective so i
 
00:19:28.799 --> 00:19:29.830 align:start position:0%
are necessary and are effective so i
think

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
i think you should listen to the
 
00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
silent majority more than the more
 
00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
outspoken minority
 
00:19:37.669 --> 00:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
understand why they're
 
00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
i mean i understand why everybody's
 
00:19:41.029 --> 00:19:41.039 align:start position:0%
upset about this and scared but i think
 
00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
you should listen to the silent um
 
00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:44.549 align:start position:0%
you should listen to the silent um
anti-covet

00:19:44.549 --> 00:19:44.559 align:start position:0%
anti-covet
 
00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
and pro-vaccine majority on this thanks
 
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
will you take questions
 
00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:52.480 align:start position:0%
sure why not sure any questions from the
 
00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:55.190 align:start position:0%
sure why not sure any questions from the
committee

00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
i'm going to ask one because
 
00:19:59.029 --> 00:19:59.039 align:start position:0%
i'll ask
 
00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:01.360 align:start position:0%
representative leon so
 
00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:04.480 align:start position:0%
whenever somebody uses the 750 thousand
 
00:20:07.029 --> 00:20:07.039 align:start position:0%
dollar that thousand death toll that's
 
00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
in there and i'm i'm a kind of a numbers
 
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
and data guy and i guess my question was
 
00:20:12.789 --> 00:20:12.799 align:start position:0%
are you aware that there are over seven
 
00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
thousand deaths reported in that total
 
00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
that are from self-inflicted injuries
 
00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
and poisoning but being classified as
 
00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:24.789 --> 00:20:24.799 align:start position:0%
i have not have not heard that
 
00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
particular statistic i
 
00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
um i don't really
 
00:20:32.149 --> 00:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
mean some of those some of those people
 
00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
were probably severely depressed and
 
00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
suicidal even before covent and that was
 
00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
just one of the things that set them
 
00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:40.240 align:start position:0%
over the top so i'm not um
 
00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:41.200 align:start position:0%
even though
 
00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
nobody enjoyed being locked down nobody
 
00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
i mean i don't like wearing these masks
 
00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
i don't think the number of people have
 
00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
killed themselves because of that is
 
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
i think that's a fraction of those
 
00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
who've been actually killed by the virus
 
00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
so um i'll
 
00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:56.720 align:start position:0%
look into that i was not aware of that
 
00:20:58.549 --> 00:20:58.559 align:start position:0%
statistic i don't know where it comes
 
00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
from so i can't comment further than
 
00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
that it's from the cdc website and they
 
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
reported deaths in their causations of
 
00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:05.190 align:start position:0%
reported deaths in their causations of
deaths

00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
deaths
 
00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
that they classify as covet deaths and
 
00:21:09.669 --> 00:21:09.679 align:start position:0%
then have a secondary classification and
 
00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
it's again self-inflicted injury and
 
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
poisonings um and how many did you say
 
00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:16.640 align:start position:0%
once again over seven thousand okay
 
00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
that's still just one percent of the
 
00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
seven hundred thousand so i mean i'll
 
00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
look into it but
 
00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
um i don't think
 
00:21:26.149 --> 00:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
just like that you're not really uh
 
00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:28.400 align:start position:0%
so follow-up question so again
 
00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:29.430 align:start position:0%
so follow-up question so again
um

00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
relative to vaccines vaccine mandates i
 
00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:34.480 align:start position:0%
i think it was your testimony that this
 
00:21:36.549 --> 00:21:36.559 align:start position:0%
has never been an issue before and i
 
00:21:37.909 --> 00:21:37.919 align:start position:0%
think that probably the crux of the
 
00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
factor is the mandate in and of itself
 
00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
in that before
 
00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:42.630 align:start position:0%
in that before
um

00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:44.549 --> 00:21:44.559 align:start position:0%
citizens had the right to through
 
00:21:46.149 --> 00:21:46.159 align:start position:0%
various exemption models to get
 
00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
exemptions and and now those models are
 
00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
being taken away those rights are being
 
00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
taken away to have exemptions we heard
 
00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
testimony from a nurse yesterday monday
 
00:21:58.230 --> 00:21:58.240 align:start position:0%
that said that while she was giving a
 
00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
religious exemption for the purposes of
 
00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
an influenza vaccine at her healthcare
 
00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
facility when it came to covid they
 
00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
decided that she wasn't entitled to a
 
00:22:07.029 --> 00:22:07.039 align:start position:0%
religious exemption and took it away and
 
00:22:08.149 --> 00:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
fired her
 
00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
so does that sound like a reasonable
 
00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
course of action that we want our
 
00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
businesses looking at how religious
 
00:22:15.029 --> 00:22:15.039 align:start position:0%
individuals are and whether they qualify
 
00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:16.720 align:start position:0%
or not for a religious exemption is that
 
00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
what we should be putting our businesses
 
00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
in the middle of
 
00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:20.720 align:start position:0%
well the
 
00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
businesses also have a vested interest
 
00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
in not killing off their employees
 
00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
especially now there's a labor shortage
 
00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:27.940 align:start position:0%
or their customers
 
00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:29.190 align:start position:0%
or their customers
[Music]

00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
this is a disease that's
 
00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:33.200 align:start position:0%
much more dangerous than the seasonal
 
00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
flu and also of course the seasonal flu
 
00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
i think is more dangerous than we
 
00:22:39.029 --> 00:22:39.039 align:start position:0%
realize too there are
 
00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
actually a fair number of people get
 
00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
killed by it every year but um in terms
 
00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
of that specific case um
 
00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
i was not at the i was not at the
 
00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
hearing yesterday also having a way of
 
00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
verifying if what she said was was
 
00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:52.480 align:start position:0%
accurate or not
 
00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
i can say though that that one we had
 
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
when we had a debate about religious
 
00:22:58.710 --> 00:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
procedures the
 
00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
issue of vaccinations did not come up
 
00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
and certainly the mainstream religious
 
00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
groups who were
 
00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:05.750 align:start position:0%
groups who were
opposed

00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
to the buffer zone and there are others
 
00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:09.200 align:start position:0%
who in favor of it but those are opposed
 
00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
to it never brought up vaccinations at
 
00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
all so they've never been you know they
 
00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
those particular
 
00:23:17.669 --> 00:23:17.679 align:start position:0%
those groups the roman catholic church
 
00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
and mostly the evangelical movement
 
00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:21.430 align:start position:0%
and mostly the evangelical movement
there

00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
they were not opposed to vaccines then
 
00:23:25.029 --> 00:23:25.039 align:start position:0%
there's certainly a catholic church
 
00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
which i'm a member of although not a
 
00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
very good member of it's actually
 
00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:30.149 align:start position:0%
very good member of it's actually
actively

00:23:30.149 --> 00:23:30.159 align:start position:0%
actively
 
00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
pro-vaccine and also
 
00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
made a point when the pandemic started
 
00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
of uh you know of uh taking the
 
00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
emergency measures they had for example
 
00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
the dramatic thing where the pope
 
00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:41.590 align:start position:0%
the dramatic thing where the pope
addressed

00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:42.470 align:start position:0%
addressed
it

00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:23:44.789 --> 00:23:44.799 align:start position:0%
did his easter address in saint peter's
 
00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
square and he pointedly had
 
00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
nobody in the square except for one
 
00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
cameraman so certainly uh
 
00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
so certainly my particular church that i
 
00:23:54.789 --> 00:23:54.799 align:start position:0%
was brought in is actually very much
 
00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
pro-vaccine and there's
 
00:23:58.870 --> 00:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
so i'm not sure there was an answer in
 
00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
there but okay okay um
 
00:24:03.029 --> 00:24:03.039 align:start position:0%
you know my question was strictly around
 
00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:05.200 align:start position:0%
is this what we are businesses doing is
 
00:24:07.029 --> 00:24:07.039 align:start position:0%
determining whether somebody's religious
 
00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
enough to be entitled to a religious
 
00:24:11.269 --> 00:24:11.279 align:start position:0%
exemption from a vaccine that's my
 
00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
question should businesses be put in
 
00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
that position and don't you agree that
 
00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
if we put them in that position it
 
00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
creates then a follow-up civil rights
 
00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
problem for them if they should deny a
 
00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
medical exemption and say whole classes
 
00:24:24.549 --> 00:24:24.559 align:start position:0%
of people can no longer work in my
 
00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
facility because of their religious
 
00:24:28.149 --> 00:24:28.159 align:start position:0%
beliefs don't you think that because
 
00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
becomes a problem well there's a
 
00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
constitutional right to freedom of
 
00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
religion there
 
00:24:36.789 --> 00:24:36.799 align:start position:0%
is no constitutional right to
 
00:24:40.149 --> 00:24:40.159 align:start position:0%
spread a communicable disease so
 
00:24:40.159 --> 00:24:40.950 align:start position:0%
spread a communicable disease so
i

00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
you know it's up to the businesses
 
00:24:44.789 --> 00:24:44.799 align:start position:0%
businesses decide what their policies
 
00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
should be and i think probably most of
 
00:24:48.549 --> 00:24:48.559 align:start position:0%
them would like to have their
 
00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:50.320 align:start position:0%
most of them would like to have as many
 
00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
of their employees as possible be
 
00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
vaccinated um and bearing in mind there
 
00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
probably are some legitimate cases where
 
00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
they or they can't but for whatever
 
00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:58.630 align:start position:0%
they or they can't but for whatever
reason

00:24:58.630 --> 00:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
reason
 
00:24:59.750 --> 00:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
number of people who are claiming
 
00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
religious exemptions seem to be vastly
 
00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
larger than it was back when the worst
 
00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
thing we had to worry about was say you
 
00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
know the seasonal flu and so forth
 
00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
representative leon do you have a
 
00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:11.430 align:start position:0%
representative leon do you have a
question

00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
you asked what i was going to ask thank
 
00:25:15.029 --> 00:25:15.039 align:start position:0%
you thank you thank you representative
 
00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:16.720 align:start position:0%
morgan thank you and i'm just speaking
 
00:25:18.789 --> 00:25:18.799 align:start position:0%
for myself with my opinions and i i
 
00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
understand where you're coming from so
 
00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:36.149 --> 00:25:36.159 align:start position:0%
so i do want to speak in facts and
 
00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
address some specifics that are in the
 
00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:40.240 align:start position:0%
new hampshire constitution
 
00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:41.430 align:start position:0%
new hampshire constitution
and

00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:44.240 align:start position:0%
the constitution for the america united
 
00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
states of america but first i i'd like
 
00:25:48.149 --> 00:25:48.159 align:start position:0%
to actually
 
00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
take us all back a little bit
 
00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
i'd like to take you back to being a
 
00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
teenager and if you can remember what
 
00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
so for some of us that's a long time ago
 
00:26:04.549 --> 00:26:04.559 align:start position:0%
and maybe it's easier to remember or
 
00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
think about if you have a child that's
 
00:26:09.669 --> 00:26:09.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
i think that our nation
 
00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
is very much
 
00:26:17.909 --> 00:26:17.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit of rebelliousness
 
00:26:21.029 --> 00:26:21.039 align:start position:0%
going on
 
00:26:22.549 --> 00:26:22.559 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of
 
00:26:24.789 --> 00:26:24.799 align:start position:0%
what i think is best
 
00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
i know best
 
00:26:28.149 --> 00:26:28.159 align:start position:0%
i know better than
 
00:26:30.789 --> 00:26:30.799 align:start position:0%
those who came before me
 
00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:39.269 --> 00:26:39.279 align:start position:0%
do things my way
 
00:26:41.269 --> 00:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
and i think we all know where that goes
 
00:26:44.789 --> 00:26:44.799 align:start position:0%
right as we grow and mature
 
00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
we realize that some of those rules and
 
00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
structures that were put in place by our
 
00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:51.269 align:start position:0%
structures that were put in place by our
parents

00:26:51.269 --> 00:26:51.279 align:start position:0%
parents
 
00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
were done so lovingly
 
00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
with wisdom
 
00:26:58.149 --> 00:26:58.159 align:start position:0%
with experience of having been there
 
00:26:58.159 --> 00:26:59.590 align:start position:0%
with experience of having been there
before

00:26:59.590 --> 00:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
and not out of cruelty
 
00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
or ignorance
 
00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
or not being cool
 
00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:07.669 align:start position:0%
or not being cool
so

00:27:07.669 --> 00:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
teenagers often think that's whatever
 
00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
whatever is now whatever is present is
 
00:27:15.269 --> 00:27:15.279 align:start position:0%
best right their music their clothing
 
00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:20.480 align:start position:0%
and what i would say is that
 
00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:22.240 align:start position:0%
when we mature we become adults
 
00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
ourselves we often find that we go back
 
00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
to our parents structure and standards
 
00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
and their beliefs right for our own
 
00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
children because we realize there was
 
00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
validity there
 
00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:36.640 align:start position:0%
assuming you had
 
00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
so in the case of this country this
 
00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:44.149 align:start position:0%
so in the case of this country this
nation

00:27:44.149 --> 00:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
nation
 
00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
i looked to our forefathers
 
00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
as our parents
 
00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:52.480 align:start position:0%
and what i see is that they put
 
00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
a very specific structure in place
 
00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
our constitution
 
00:27:59.669 --> 00:27:59.679 align:start position:0%
not just to limit government which was
 
00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
definitely the intention right was to
 
00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:02.630 align:start position:0%
definitely the intention right was to
limit

00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
limit
 
00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:04.950 align:start position:0%
limit
government

00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
okay to give us
 
00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
that compass those guidelines so that we
 
00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
didn't go completely off course from the
 
00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
intention of this nation
 
00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
right the intention of those founding
 
00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:30.549 --> 00:28:30.559 align:start position:0%
that was the aim that was the goal
 
00:28:30.559 --> 00:28:32.470 align:start position:0%
that was the aim that was the goal
right

00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:28:35.029 --> 00:28:35.039 align:start position:0%
so with that in mind i want to point out
 
00:28:36.789 --> 00:28:36.799 align:start position:0%
a few things
 
00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
one being
 
00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:40.240 align:start position:0%
what was just mentioned the freedom of
 
00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
religion that is provided for in the new
 
00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire constitution
 
00:28:47.669 --> 00:28:47.679 align:start position:0%
as well as our federal constitution
 
00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:50.720 align:start position:0%
but what is religion
 
00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:52.720 align:start position:0%
so many of us think freedom of religion
 
00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:54.640 align:start position:0%
what that pertains to is being able to
 
00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:55.510 align:start position:0%
what that pertains to is being able to
go

00:28:55.510 --> 00:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
go
 
00:28:58.870 --> 00:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
to wherever it is you want to worship
 
00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
whether it's a mosque or a temple or a
 
00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:02.630 align:start position:0%
whether it's a mosque or a temple or a
church

00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
church
 
00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
that freedom of religion to participate
 
00:29:08.149 --> 00:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
in your religious practices
 
00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:14.549 --> 00:29:14.559 align:start position:0%
it's a set of beliefs
 
00:29:14.559 --> 00:29:16.470 align:start position:0%
it's a set of beliefs
right

00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:16.480 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:29:21.669 --> 00:29:21.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
so i for instance
 
00:29:27.029 --> 00:29:27.039 align:start position:0%
believe very strongly that there is one
 
00:29:27.039 --> 00:29:28.549 align:start position:0%
believe very strongly that there is one
god

00:29:28.549 --> 00:29:28.559 align:start position:0%
god
 
00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:34.389 --> 00:29:34.399 align:start position:0%
i don't go to church
 
00:29:37.269 --> 00:29:37.279 align:start position:0%
but i have a religious practice in my
 
00:29:37.279 --> 00:29:38.070 align:start position:0%
but i have a religious practice in my
life

00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
life
 
00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
and i have beliefs that are associated
 
00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
other people believe that god is nature
 
00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
and those beliefs will lead us to
 
00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
different practices
 
00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
it might be specific foods that we eat
 
00:29:56.549 --> 00:29:56.559 align:start position:0%
or don't eat because it's part of our
 
00:29:58.389 --> 00:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
religious beliefs it might be the way
 
00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
that we dress it might be different
 
00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:02.720 align:start position:0%
customs it might be the way we operate
 
00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
and function in our daily lives
 
00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
so we're allowed to have and our beliefs
 
00:30:15.269 --> 00:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
those religious freedoms to believe are
 
00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
they were provided for specifically
 
00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
so if we look at
 
00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
article 2 in the new hampshire
 
00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
constitution in the bill of rights all
 
00:30:33.909 --> 00:30:33.919 align:start position:0%
men have certain natural
 
00:30:33.919 --> 00:30:35.110 align:start position:0%
men have certain natural
essential

00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
essential
 
00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
and inherent rights
 
00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:38.149 align:start position:0%
and inherent rights
natural

00:30:38.149 --> 00:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
natural
 
00:30:38.159 --> 00:30:40.149 align:start position:0%
natural
inherent

00:30:40.149 --> 00:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
inherent
 
00:30:42.149 --> 00:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
that means from god
 
00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
it's not given to us by government right
 
00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:49.909 --> 00:30:49.919 align:start position:0%
rights among which are the enjoying and
 
00:30:51.909 --> 00:30:51.919 align:start position:0%
defending and i know you all know this
 
00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
but we can't hear this enough
 
00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:56.480 align:start position:0%
defending life and liberty
 
00:30:58.230 --> 00:30:58.240 align:start position:0%
i'll skip through a little bit
 
00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
seeking and obtaining happiness
 
00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:04.240 align:start position:0%
so if we actually start to define these
 
00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
words and what they mean
 
00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
what is life
 
00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
what is liberty
 
00:31:13.509 --> 00:31:13.519 align:start position:0%
what is the ability to obtain
 
00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:19.909 --> 00:31:19.919 align:start position:0%
and tie that in with the religious
 
00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
freedoms and the protection
 
00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
of our religious freedoms
 
00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
article the next article 2b right of
 
00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
privacy an individual's right to live
 
00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:32.480 align:start position:0%
free from governmental intrusion
 
00:31:35.909 --> 00:31:35.919 align:start position:0%
in private or personal information is
 
00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
again natural
 
00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:43.669 --> 00:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
some of these rights in article 4 it
 
00:31:43.679 --> 00:31:45.029 align:start position:0%
some of these rights in article 4 it
states

00:31:45.029 --> 00:31:45.039 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:31:48.789 --> 00:31:48.799 align:start position:0%
are in their very nature unalienable
 
00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
they cannot be taken away
 
00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
this is the limit on government that our
 
00:31:58.149 --> 00:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
founding fathers put in place
 
00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
to keep us on course to not be in
 
00:32:03.509 --> 00:32:03.519 align:start position:0%
continual debate about our beliefs
 
00:32:04.789 --> 00:32:04.799 align:start position:0%
because we're going to have different
 
00:32:04.799 --> 00:32:08.870 align:start position:0%
because we're going to have different
beliefs

00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
every individual has a natural this is
 
00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
article 5 a natural and unannual right
 
00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
to worship god according to the dictates
 
00:32:19.029 --> 00:32:19.039 align:start position:0%
of his own conscience
 
00:32:21.909 --> 00:32:21.919 align:start position:0%
and reason and no subject shall be hurt
 
00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
molested or restrained in his person
 
00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
liberty liberty or estate for worshiping
 
00:32:30.389 --> 00:32:30.399 align:start position:0%
god in the manner and season most
 
00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:32.720 align:start position:0%
agreeable to the dictates of his own
 
00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:34.549 align:start position:0%
agreeable to the dictates of his own
conscience

00:32:34.549 --> 00:32:34.559 align:start position:0%
conscience
 
00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
so if it is in with my own conscience
 
00:32:40.149 --> 00:32:40.159 align:start position:0%
that i do not
 
00:32:41.909 --> 00:32:41.919 align:start position:0%
want to partake in a medical
 
00:32:41.919 --> 00:32:43.669 align:start position:0%
want to partake in a medical
intervention

00:32:43.669 --> 00:32:43.679 align:start position:0%
intervention
 
00:32:47.029 --> 00:32:47.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:50.320 align:start position:0%
that is an unan unalienable
 
00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:51.909 align:start position:0%
that is an unan unalienable
belief

00:32:51.909 --> 00:32:51.919 align:start position:0%
belief
 
00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
that cannot be taken from me
 
00:32:58.149 --> 00:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
and no government can mandate
 
00:33:02.389 --> 00:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
i think the rest of these you all know
 
00:33:20.789 --> 00:33:20.799 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to jump to some u.s code
 
00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
so this is title 18
 
00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
section 241
 
00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
conspiracy against rights if two or more
 
00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
persons conspire to injure oppress
 
00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
threaten or intimidate any person in any
 
00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
state territory commonwealth possession
 
00:33:38.789 --> 00:33:38.799 align:start position:0%

00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:40.960 align:start position:0%

00:33:45.269 --> 00:33:45.279 align:start position:0%

because of his having so exercised the
 
00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:49.110 align:start position:0%

same

00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
same
 
00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
or if two or more persons go into skies
 
00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%

right or privilege so secured they shall
 
00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
be fined under this title or imprisoned
 
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
not more than 10 years or both and if
 
00:34:14.149 --> 00:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:15.669 --> 00:34:15.679 align:start position:0%
it can be sent there can be a sentence
 
00:34:15.679 --> 00:34:18.829 align:start position:0%
it can be sent there can be a sentence
of

00:34:18.829 --> 00:34:18.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
there's an oath that's taken
 
00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
right to protect and uphold the
 
00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:29.430 align:start position:0%
right to protect and uphold the
constitution

00:34:29.430 --> 00:34:29.440 align:start position:0%

00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
and that oath is taken
 
00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:38.240 align:start position:0%
so just like
 
00:34:40.149 --> 00:34:40.159 align:start position:0%
there are consequences
 
00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
for teenage children
 
00:34:45.990 --> 00:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
who go off course or misbehave
 
00:34:48.470 --> 00:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
or don't follow the rules of structure
 
00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
there are consequences for those who
 
00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
take an oath to uphold the constitution
 
00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
of the united states or new hampshire
 
00:34:56.950 --> 00:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
and who break
 
00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
title 18 section 245
 
00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:06.640 align:start position:0%
whoever whether or not acting under
 
00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:10.240 align:start position:0%

class of persons from there's a whole
 
00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
lot of them but i'm going to focus on c
 
00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
which is applying for
 
00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:35.520 align:start position:0%

or any prerequisite thereof
 
00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
in section two any person because of his
 
00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:50.640 align:start position:0%

00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
applying for or enjoying employment or

agency
 
00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:08.640 align:start position:0%
and then there's lots more here but when
 
00:36:11.349 --> 00:36:11.359 align:start position:0%
we get to the shell and shall not
 
00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:18.160 align:start position:0%

or both
 
00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:32.240 align:start position:0%
and if bodily injury results from the
 
00:36:33.829 --> 00:36:33.839 align:start position:0%
acts committed
 
00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
in violation of this section
 
00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:43.030 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
i'm really just here to request
 
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
that you take your oath seriously
 
00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
in upholding the new hampshire
 
00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:51.910 align:start position:0%

constitution

00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:51.920 align:start position:0%

and the constitution for the united
 
00:36:56.310 --> 00:36:56.320 align:start position:0%
states of america
 
00:36:58.310 --> 00:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
that we have freedoms that have been
 
00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
granted to us
 
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
that cannot be taken away they are
 
00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:05.349 align:start position:0%
that cannot be taken away they are
unalienable

00:37:05.349 --> 00:37:05.359 align:start position:0%
unalienable
 
00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
and those freedoms include our beliefs
 
00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
our freedom of religion
 
00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
and our founders put those in place
 
00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
to help all of us
 
00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
to help all of us stay on the course
 
00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
of freedom and liberty
 
00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
that was our main goal as a nation
 
00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
so those safeguards were put in place
 
00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:36.160 align:start position:0%
for that reason so if we think we know
 
00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
better if we think we can make up new
 
00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:39.589 align:start position:0%
better if we think we can make up new
rules

00:37:39.589 --> 00:37:39.599 align:start position:0%
rules
 
00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
and new standards
 
00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
and create a new structure
 
00:37:46.069 --> 00:37:46.079 align:start position:0%
let us not be
 
00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
so arrogant
 
00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
let us not be that teenager that
 
00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
rebellious teenager and let us learn
 
00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:54.640 align:start position:0%
from the past
 
00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
let us learn from the wisdom and
 
00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:00.640 align:start position:0%
experience of those founding fathers
 
00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
and follow
 
00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:04.470 align:start position:0%
and follow
suit

00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:04.480 align:start position:0%

00:38:08.069 --> 00:38:08.079 align:start position:0%
questions sure does the committee have
 
00:38:12.069 --> 00:38:12.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
hi thank you for taking my comments
 
00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:33.990 align:start position:0%
hi thank you for taking my comments
today

00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:38:35.910 --> 00:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
my name is louise spencer i'm from
 
00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
concord new hampshire
 
00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
and i was here at the monday hearing
 
00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
i was asked
 
00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
to provide some
 
00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:46.240 align:start position:0%
information to louise can you step up to
 
00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
them you're gonna need to talk a little
 
00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
louder with your mask on or take it off
 
00:38:51.270 --> 00:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
while you speak one of the two
 
00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:52.470 align:start position:0%
while you speak one of the two
um

00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:52.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
i was asked to provide some information
 
00:38:59.910 --> 00:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh to specifically representative leon
 
00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
so i wrote a letter and follow-up to
 
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
that request
 
00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:04.720 align:start position:0%
and i would like to read that for the
 
00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:06.150 align:start position:0%
and i would like to read that for the
record

00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:06.160 align:start position:0%
record
 
00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:07.430 align:start position:0%
record
today

00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:08.870 align:start position:0%
today
so

00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:39:11.430 --> 00:39:11.440 align:start position:0%
i write and follow up to your request at
 
00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
today's public hearing that i forward
 
00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
high quality medical studies that would
 
00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
show i was correct in stating that there
 
00:39:21.349 --> 00:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
was misinformation being presented at
 
00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
today's hearing and elsewhere
 
00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
and in support of my position
 
00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
that elected officials must do a better
 
00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
job on countering such misinformation
 
00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
i am happy to provide you with
 
00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
additional materials however given that
 
00:39:39.349 --> 00:39:39.359 align:start position:0%
there was so much in-person testimony
 
00:39:42.069 --> 00:39:42.079 align:start position:0%
with so much misinformation included i
 
00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
respectfully request that you let me
 
00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
know what specific points you would like
 
00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
me to address
 
00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:50.240 align:start position:0%
would it be the claim that covid
 
00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:51.510 align:start position:0%
would it be the claim that covid
vaccines

00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
vaccines
 
00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
that those
 
00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
that the cova vaccine is a shot of aids
 
00:39:59.109 --> 00:39:59.119 align:start position:0%
that those receiving the covid vaccine
 
00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
are pricked with cancer-causing
 
00:40:03.589 --> 00:40:03.599 align:start position:0%
substances that covet is not dangerous
 
00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
that kovid does not kill anyone
 
00:40:07.589 --> 00:40:07.599 align:start position:0%
that the vaccine does not protect
 
00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
against variants that the kovid is not
 
00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:12.640 align:start position:0%
that kovit is not a pandemic
 
00:40:15.349 --> 00:40:15.359 align:start position:0%
there was other misinformation presented
 
00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
but these seem some of the more prima
 
00:40:19.109 --> 00:40:19.119 align:start position:0%
facie false claims
 
00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
i apologize i had to leave early last
 
00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
hearing so i might have missed others
 
00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
it would have been helpful if you had
 
00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
asked some of the people who spoke
 
00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
against vaccines the same question you
 
00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
asked me
 
00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
and i would be interested in seeing
 
00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:36.720 align:start position:0%
what high quality medical data they have
 
00:40:39.109 --> 00:40:39.119 align:start position:0%
to support the claims listed above that
 
00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:46.640 align:start position:0%
i appreciate that the covenanting virus
 
00:40:48.309 --> 00:40:48.319 align:start position:0%
is a novel virus
 
00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
and that the vaccine developed in
 
00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
response the vaccines developed in
 
00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
response are new
 
00:40:55.829 --> 00:40:55.839 align:start position:0%
although they are indeed based on years
 
00:40:57.430 --> 00:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
of research
 
00:40:59.270 --> 00:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
i also recognize that there are many
 
00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:02.720 align:start position:0%
issues upon which there is not yet broad
 
00:41:04.309 --> 00:41:04.319 align:start position:0%
consensus within the medical and
 
00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
scientific communities the role of
 
00:41:09.829 --> 00:41:09.839 align:start position:0%
natural immunity being one such instance
 
00:41:11.349 --> 00:41:11.359 align:start position:0%
where i think some of our elected
 
00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
leaders do a disservice
 
00:41:15.349 --> 00:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
is when they support or refuse to
 
00:41:15.359 --> 00:41:16.550 align:start position:0%
is when they support or refuse to
confront

00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
confront
 
00:41:19.349 --> 00:41:19.359 align:start position:0%
the sort of obvious disinformation
 
00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
that sadly was too often on display
 
00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
this failure undermines our ability to
 
00:41:27.109 --> 00:41:27.119 align:start position:0%
have real conversations
 
00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
and policy discussions that can help
 
00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
lead to compromise and best practices
 
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
that benefit all of us
 
00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
i again implore your committee
 
00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
to adopt an affirmative statement
 
00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
recognizing the critically important
 
00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
role that vaccines have had
 
00:41:47.349 --> 00:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
and continue to have in advancing and
 
00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
maintaining good
 
00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
public health
 
00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
and promoting the adoption of
 
00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
science-based immunization policies and
 
00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:55.670 align:start position:0%
science-based immunization policies and
procedures

00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
procedures
 
00:41:58.950 --> 00:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
so that was my letter i also sent along
 
00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
a follow-up that talked about the salk
 
00:42:03.109 --> 00:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
and 7 vaccines
 
00:42:05.349 --> 00:42:05.359 align:start position:0%
and the fact that both are still
 
00:42:08.069 --> 00:42:08.079 align:start position:0%
variants of both are still in use today
 
00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
with some having
 
00:42:13.349 --> 00:42:13.359 align:start position:0%
value depending on the situation in
 
00:42:16.390 --> 00:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
which they are used
 
00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
i would also just like to
 
00:42:21.109 --> 00:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
add that
 
00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
upon hearing the last testimony
 
00:42:27.030 --> 00:42:27.040 align:start position:0%
throughout the course of our nation
 
00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
rights have always been balanced with
 
00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:30.550 align:start position:0%
rights have always been balanced with
responsibilities

00:42:30.550 --> 00:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
 
00:42:33.670 --> 00:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
and that we have a court system that
 
00:42:36.309 --> 00:42:36.319 align:start position:0%
helps us to navigate that difficult
 
00:42:36.319 --> 00:42:37.750 align:start position:0%
helps us to navigate that difficult
process

00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:40.240 align:start position:0%
rights often come into conflict with one
 
00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:41.589 align:start position:0%
rights often come into conflict with one
another

00:42:41.589 --> 00:42:41.599 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
and there is no absolute right
 
00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:46.720 align:start position:0%
guaranteed to anyone
 
00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:50.480 align:start position:0%
in the constitution if there were
 
00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
then the death penalty in every instance
 
00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:42:57.750 --> 00:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
considered unconstitutional
 
00:42:59.349 --> 00:42:59.359 align:start position:0%
but clearly
 
00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
the right to life is not an absolute
 
00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:03.750 align:start position:0%
the right to life is not an absolute
right

00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:05.109 align:start position:0%
right
so

00:43:05.109 --> 00:43:05.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
at some point
 
00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:08.480 align:start position:0%
we need to recognize
 
00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
that difficult decisions have to be made
 
00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
we had a founding father george
 
00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:15.750 align:start position:0%
we had a founding father george
washington

00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
washington
 
00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:16.550 align:start position:0%
washington
who

00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
required his troops to get vaccinated
 
00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
did that violate violate violate other
 
00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:24.710 align:start position:0%
did that violate violate violate other
rights

00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
rights
 
00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
it certainly did
 
00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:28.640 align:start position:0%
but a balance
 
00:43:30.870 --> 00:43:30.880 align:start position:0%
had to be struck and a decision had to
 
00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
be made
 
00:43:34.069 --> 00:43:34.079 align:start position:0%
so with that i will conclude my
 
00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
testimony for today
 
00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions for ms spencer
 
00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
erica representative
 
00:43:44.550 --> 00:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
thank you um and if i may respond some
 
00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:46.160 align:start position:0%
because that was a letter that was sent
 
00:43:47.109 --> 00:43:47.119 align:start position:0%
to me
 
00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for that information on the
 
00:43:50.550 --> 00:43:50.560 align:start position:0%
sock and sabin i actually have had the
 
00:43:52.150 --> 00:43:52.160 align:start position:0%
privilege of reading the typewritten
 
00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:53.349 align:start position:0%
privilege of reading the typewritten
letter

00:43:53.349 --> 00:43:53.359 align:start position:0%
letter
 
00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
from jonas salk when he was accepting
 
00:43:58.069 --> 00:43:58.079 align:start position:0%
award at the white house because he
 
00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
worked with saban to bring forth the
 
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
vaccines that actually were the ones
 
00:44:04.069 --> 00:44:04.079 align:start position:0%
that did impact the world so thank you
 
00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
for bringing light to that collaborative
 
00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
decades-long process in order to perfect
 
00:44:10.309 --> 00:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
the vaccines
 
00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
when you speak to rights and
 
00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:13.910 align:start position:0%
when you speak to rights and
responsibilities

00:44:13.910 --> 00:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
 
00:44:16.069 --> 00:44:16.079 align:start position:0%
is there a different standard of rights
 
00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
when you are offering a choice to
 
00:44:22.630 --> 00:44:22.640 align:start position:0%
somebody or mandating them to take
 
00:44:25.510 --> 00:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
to take a procedure
 
00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
i wish
 
00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
that we had the same sort of
 
00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:31.829 align:start position:0%
that we had the same sort of
civic

00:44:31.829 --> 00:44:31.839 align:start position:0%
civic
 
00:44:34.069 --> 00:44:34.079 align:start position:0%
engagement and sense of personal
 
00:44:34.079 --> 00:44:35.670 align:start position:0%
engagement and sense of personal
responsibility

00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
00:44:37.829 --> 00:44:37.839 align:start position:0%
that would allow us
 
00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:40.240 align:start position:0%
to really do a
 
00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
rigorous and robust
 
00:44:45.109 --> 00:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
public education campaign
 
00:44:47.349 --> 00:44:47.359 align:start position:0%
that would help people to make
 
00:44:49.109 --> 00:44:49.119 align:start position:0%
to understand that the vaccines are
 
00:44:50.950 --> 00:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
generally safe
 
00:44:53.829 --> 00:44:53.839 align:start position:0%
and that people would voluntarily take
 
00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
these vaccines i really wish that was
 
00:44:57.829 --> 00:44:57.839 align:start position:0%
the case
 
00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that is greatly hampered
 
00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:02.790 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that is greatly hampered
by

00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:45:05.349 --> 00:45:05.359 align:start position:0%
the sort of misinformation that is not
 
00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
being confronted
 
00:45:09.349 --> 00:45:09.359 align:start position:0%
that makes it difficult for people to
 
00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:12.640 align:start position:0%
decide to voluntarily take that vaccine
 
00:45:14.550 --> 00:45:14.560 align:start position:0%
and so if we were
 
00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
taking away the misinformation and just
 
00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
dealing with the facts
 
00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:21.200 align:start position:0%
yes i can understand that there are some
 
00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:24.160 align:start position:0%
people for religious or other purposes
 
00:45:26.309 --> 00:45:26.319 align:start position:0%
that might decide not to
 
00:45:27.829 --> 00:45:27.839 align:start position:0%
take the vaccine
 
00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
but if 80 or 90 percent of the
 
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.510 align:start position:0%
but if 80 or 90 percent of the
population

00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
population
 
00:45:34.390 --> 00:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
were through good education efforts with
 
00:45:36.550 --> 00:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
correct information
 
00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
vaccinated that would be much less of a
 
00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:41.200 align:start position:0%
problem we've seen that already with
 
00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:44.640 align:start position:0%
vaccine programs about measles rubella
 
00:45:48.550 --> 00:45:48.560 align:start position:0%
where the government puts out a campaign
 
00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:51.680 align:start position:0%
with the help of public health officials
 
00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
and the public responds in a generally
 
00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
positive way
 
00:45:57.109 --> 00:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
we've seen when
 
00:45:57.119 --> 00:45:58.150 align:start position:0%
we've seen when
people

00:45:58.150 --> 00:45:58.160 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:00.160 align:start position:0%
in certain communities have withdrawn
 
00:46:02.390 --> 00:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
their support of vaccines we've seen
 
00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
measles for example we've seen many
 
00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
outbreaks small localized
 
00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:08.870 align:start position:0%
outbreaks small localized
um

00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
not sure you would call it an epidemic
 
00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
in that instance because it's local but
 
00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:14.640 align:start position:0%
with a broad outbreak
 
00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:15.589 align:start position:0%
with a broad outbreak
so

00:46:15.589 --> 00:46:15.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:46:15.599 --> 00:46:17.109 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:46:17.109 --> 00:46:17.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:19.349 --> 00:46:19.359 align:start position:0%
you know i think we can get all riled up
 
00:46:21.589 --> 00:46:21.599 align:start position:0%
about the mandates but i think there's
 
00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:24.640 align:start position:0%
so much we could do
 
00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:25.750 align:start position:0%
so much we could do
before

00:46:25.750 --> 00:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
mandate before we even need to talk
 
00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:29.200 align:start position:0%
about mandates
 
00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
and i wish that our public leaders would
 
00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:32.720 align:start position:0%
stand up
 
00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
and start confronting this information
 
00:46:38.309 --> 00:46:38.319 align:start position:0%
and help people get the real facts about
 
00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:40.160 align:start position:0%
this vaccine
 
00:46:42.309 --> 00:46:42.319 align:start position:0%
and my last follow-up is do you know the
 
00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
difference between an observational
 
00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.030 align:start position:0%
difference between an observational
study

00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
study
 
00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:47.200 align:start position:0%
especially a retrospective observational
 
00:46:49.349 --> 00:46:49.359 align:start position:0%
study and a prospective randomized
 
00:46:50.710 --> 00:46:50.720 align:start position:0%
controlled trial
 
00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
and the difference in clinical evidence
 
00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
for them you know that's not my
 
00:46:56.710 --> 00:46:56.720 align:start position:0%
responsibility here to know that you
 
00:46:58.950 --> 00:46:58.960 align:start position:0%
have a state epidemiologist you have a
 
00:47:00.550 --> 00:47:00.560 align:start position:0%
department of health
 
00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:02.960 align:start position:0%
you can get that information there i'm
 
00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
speaking as a public citizen as a
 
00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
citizen here with my concerns i think
 
00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:11.200 align:start position:0%
there's a role for lay information we
 
00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
can call a spade
 
00:47:13.990 --> 00:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
a state
 
00:47:16.150 --> 00:47:16.160 align:start position:0%
you cannot look at
 
00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
the claim
 
00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
that the vaccine injects aids
 
00:47:23.589 --> 00:47:23.599 align:start position:0%
and say that that is based on any
 
00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
scientific data
 
00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
and that should be confronted
 
00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
and we should look to our leaders
 
00:47:32.710 --> 00:47:32.720 align:start position:0%
to confront that information
 
00:47:35.109 --> 00:47:35.119 align:start position:0%
so i don't need to be caught up in
 
00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
requests for medical data
 
00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
you have plenty of resources at your
 
00:47:41.829 --> 00:47:41.839 align:start position:0%
disposal for that so thank you thank you
 
00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
and the cdc guidelines are based upon
 
00:47:47.109 --> 00:47:47.119 align:start position:0%
observational studies um and also the
 
00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:48.640 align:start position:0%
other information is not trying to force
 
00:47:50.069 --> 00:47:50.079 align:start position:0%
a choice so thank you so much for your
 
00:47:52.950 --> 00:47:52.960 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you
 
00:47:54.150 --> 00:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
ms spencer
 
00:47:57.829 --> 00:47:57.839 align:start position:0%
one more one more question sorry
 
00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
so i'm sure you can hear my frustration
 
00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:01.270 align:start position:0%
so i'm sure you can hear my frustration
because

00:48:01.270 --> 00:48:01.280 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
i will admit i am highly frustrated by
 
00:48:07.829 --> 00:48:07.839 align:start position:0%
what i saw on monday and what i'm seeing
 
00:48:07.839 --> 00:48:08.710 align:start position:0%
what i saw on monday and what i'm seeing
here

00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:08.720 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:48:11.109 --> 00:48:11.119 align:start position:0%
and what i see go on
 
00:48:14.950 --> 00:48:14.960 align:start position:0%
beyond these rooms so i am frustrated
 
00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
so i guess my question is is to your
 
00:48:18.549 --> 00:48:18.559 align:start position:0%
point of
 
00:48:20.950 --> 00:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
conversation intelligent conversation
 
00:48:22.549 --> 00:48:22.559 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to say non-emotional
 
00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
conversation right because that's the
 
00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:26.480 align:start position:0%
hardest part we have is right is when we
 
00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
talk trying to have these conversations
 
00:48:30.390 --> 00:48:30.400 align:start position:0%
for lack of a phrase in the abstract and
 
00:48:33.589 --> 00:48:33.599 align:start position:0%
not in the in the emotional phase
 
00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
so i guess my question is you know when
 
00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
you're trying to have these
 
00:48:39.589 --> 00:48:39.599 align:start position:0%
conversations do you agree it's
 
00:48:42.309 --> 00:48:42.319 align:start position:0%
important to have the right data
 
00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
yes right so
 
00:48:46.630 --> 00:48:46.640 align:start position:0%
i i think that one of the things we we
 
00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
talk about but we talk about vaccination
 
00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
rates right we know that new hampshire
 
00:48:52.309 --> 00:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
at least our new hampshire dashboards
 
00:48:53.910 --> 00:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
wrong we know that the commissioners
 
00:48:55.750 --> 00:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
come out and said that so they're
 
00:48:57.510 --> 00:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
reporting roughly about eight hundred
 
00:48:59.430 --> 00:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
thousand eight hundred thousand uh
 
00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
citizens of native the 1.3 million in
 
00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
our state have been vaccinated the cdc
 
00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
reports over a million
 
00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
right so we're approaching 80 percent
 
00:49:09.109 --> 00:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
well beyond that
 
00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
um the of of vaccinated people with
 
00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
vaccinations i'm not let me finish in
 
00:49:15.750 --> 00:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire in new hampshire so we're
 
00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
over a million citizens have had at
 
00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
least one shot or a vaccine or
 
00:49:21.430 --> 00:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
vaccinated according to the same metric
 
00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
that the state's using on their website
 
00:49:25.109 --> 00:49:25.119 align:start position:0%
which is 800 000.
 
00:49:27.190 --> 00:49:27.200 align:start position:0%
so i guess my question is i guess my
 
00:49:28.870 --> 00:49:28.880 align:start position:0%
point is is that
 
00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:30.640 align:start position:0%
you agree we have to have honest
 
00:49:32.549 --> 00:49:32.559 align:start position:0%
conversations right and we talk about
 
00:49:33.990 --> 00:49:34.000 align:start position:0%
data when you're approaching over a
 
00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
million people in new hampshire being
 
00:49:37.589 --> 00:49:37.599 align:start position:0%
vaccinated then forcing upon the
 
00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
remaining three hundred thousand
 
00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:40.549 align:start position:0%
remaining three hundred thousand
um

00:49:40.549 --> 00:49:40.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:42.309 --> 00:49:42.319 align:start position:0%
a vaccine they've chosen not to get for
 
00:49:43.510 --> 00:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
whatever reason i don't know what those
 
00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
reasons are i can't come up with 300 000
 
00:49:46.790 --> 00:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
reasons why people may choose not to get
 
00:49:49.430 --> 00:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
the vaccine but i guess my point is
 
00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
don't you think we're just arguing over
 
00:49:52.950 --> 00:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
the for the sake of arguing at this
 
00:49:56.870 --> 00:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
point no not at all and i again i'm not
 
00:49:59.270 --> 00:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
here primarily
 
00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
to talk about the mandates
 
00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
because i think
 
00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:06.880 align:start position:0%
again there's a lot that we could do
 
00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:09.200 align:start position:0%
shy of mandates i think in instances
 
00:50:11.109 --> 00:50:11.119 align:start position:0%
mandates are necessary
 
00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
what i'm really here to do
 
00:50:15.589 --> 00:50:15.599 align:start position:0%
is to encourage your committee
 
00:50:17.589 --> 00:50:17.599 align:start position:0%
to make a very strong and robust
 
00:50:21.270 --> 00:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
statement that vaccines are
 
00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
a critical part of our state health
 
00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
policy public health policy that they
 
00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:27.349 align:start position:0%
policy public health policy that they
have

00:50:27.349 --> 00:50:27.359 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:50:29.910 --> 00:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
historically and currently
 
00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
been critically important to the health
 
00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
and well-being of our communities
 
00:50:36.549 --> 00:50:36.559 align:start position:0%
and that
 
00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
we need to
 
00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:40.480 align:start position:0%
base our policies on good science and
 
00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:41.589 align:start position:0%
base our policies on good science and
data

00:50:41.589 --> 00:50:41.599 align:start position:0%
data
 
00:50:43.990 --> 00:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
so i agree that data is important i also
 
00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
agree that there are places that we
 
00:50:46.870 --> 00:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
don't have clear
 
00:50:48.549 --> 00:50:48.559 align:start position:0%
data and i would love to have those
 
00:50:50.950 --> 00:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
sorts of conversations but when those
 
00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
conversations get obscured
 
00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
by things that are clearly
 
00:50:59.670 --> 00:50:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
then we can't really then that's when
 
00:51:04.150 --> 00:51:04.160 align:start position:0%
the emotion starts going and we can't
 
00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
then really sit down and make
 
00:51:09.270 --> 00:51:09.280 align:start position:0%
compromises i have a niece whose
 
00:51:11.589 --> 00:51:11.599 align:start position:0%
political views i do not share
 
00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:14.640 align:start position:0%
and who is
 
00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:18.720 align:start position:0%
she homeschools her children she is very
 
00:51:21.109 --> 00:51:21.119 align:start position:0%
careful about what she
 
00:51:24.549 --> 00:51:24.559 align:start position:0%
how she chooses you know their diet
 
00:51:24.559 --> 00:51:25.430 align:start position:0%
how she chooses you know their diet
she

00:51:25.430 --> 00:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
she
 
00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
is very conservative about
 
00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:30.470 align:start position:0%
is very conservative about
additives

00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
additives
 
00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:31.270 align:start position:0%
additives
and

00:51:31.270 --> 00:51:31.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:51:33.109 --> 00:51:33.119 align:start position:0%
various other things that go into their
 
00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:36.720 align:start position:0%
body her children are vaccinated but she
 
00:51:38.390 --> 00:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
has chosen not
 
00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:39.510 align:start position:0%
has chosen not
to

00:51:39.510 --> 00:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:51:45.030 --> 00:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:46.549 align:start position:0%
 
however

00:51:46.549 --> 00:51:46.559 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
she also wears a mask and has her
 
00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
children wear masks when they go out to
 
00:51:52.390 --> 00:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
in public
 
00:51:54.790 --> 00:51:54.800 align:start position:0%
she observes social distancing
 
00:51:56.630 --> 00:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
she's respectful when someone else
 
00:51:58.470 --> 00:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
expresses concern about the fact that
 
00:52:01.109 --> 00:52:01.119 align:start position:0%
she's not vaccinated and makes a request
 
00:52:03.109 --> 00:52:03.119 align:start position:0%
of them a simple
 
00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
request and i really respect her and i
 
00:52:08.309 --> 00:52:08.319 align:start position:0%
respect her opinion about that and i
 
00:52:10.069 --> 00:52:10.079 align:start position:0%
understand that she has a different view
 
00:52:12.549 --> 00:52:12.559 align:start position:0%
than i do about it i also understand
 
00:52:15.030 --> 00:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
that there are religious exemptions
 
00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
you know our constitution has a
 
00:52:22.710 --> 00:52:22.720 align:start position:0%
conscientious objector clause in it
 
00:52:24.870 --> 00:52:24.880 align:start position:0%
uh that is not always that's not
 
00:52:27.349 --> 00:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
universally granted
 
00:52:29.589 --> 00:52:29.599 align:start position:0%
so you know if you want to claim as a
 
00:52:32.549 --> 00:52:32.559 align:start position:0%
quaker you know i'm familiar with people
 
00:52:35.109 --> 00:52:35.119 align:start position:0%
seeking religious exemptions for things
 
00:52:37.510 --> 00:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
like conscientious objection
 
00:52:40.470 --> 00:52:40.480 align:start position:0%
but that's not you have to go and you do
 
00:52:43.349 --> 00:52:43.359 align:start position:0%
actually have to present your religious
 
00:52:45.190 --> 00:52:45.200 align:start position:0%
beliefs they don't have to be part of a
 
00:52:47.670 --> 00:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
church they don't have to be something
 
00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
that someone else determines
 
00:52:51.829 --> 00:52:51.839 align:start position:0%
but you are required to show that it's a
 
00:52:54.309 --> 00:52:54.319 align:start position:0%
sincerely held belief
 
00:52:56.069 --> 00:52:56.079 align:start position:0%
so it's not
 
00:52:58.069 --> 00:52:58.079 align:start position:0%
you know unprecedented for people to
 
00:53:01.109 --> 00:53:01.119 align:start position:0%
have to actually um
 
00:53:03.109 --> 00:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
say you know what
 
00:53:06.150 --> 00:53:06.160 align:start position:0%
where their religious
 
00:53:07.750 --> 00:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
concerns come from
 
00:53:10.549 --> 00:53:10.559 align:start position:0%
so i just think that when we
 
00:53:11.829 --> 00:53:11.839 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:53:14.549 --> 00:53:14.559 align:start position:0%
that there's a lot of room here
 
00:53:16.870 --> 00:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
for us actually to have
 
00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:19.109 align:start position:0%
for us actually to have
conversation

00:53:19.109 --> 00:53:19.119 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
00:53:22.549 --> 00:53:22.559 align:start position:0%
what happens is we get into our camps
 
00:53:24.069 --> 00:53:24.079 align:start position:0%
where we can't come together and
 
00:53:25.829 --> 00:53:25.839 align:start position:0%
actually talk about the things that are
 
00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
undecided that we don't have good data
 
00:53:30.549 --> 00:53:30.559 align:start position:0%
on that people have questions about i
 
00:53:33.349 --> 00:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
would love us to find that space and i
 
00:53:35.829 --> 00:53:35.839 align:start position:0%
think one of the ways to find that space
 
00:53:40.710 --> 00:53:40.720 align:start position:0%
is when we discard the clearly
 
00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
incorrect information
 
00:53:45.349 --> 00:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
and we begin with things that we can
 
00:53:49.430 --> 00:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
start to verify and that we can start to
 
00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:50.870 align:start position:0%
start to verify and that we can start to
um

00:53:50.870 --> 00:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:51.829 --> 00:53:51.839 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
put the science behind and i have no
 
00:53:56.069 --> 00:53:56.079 align:start position:0%
problem standing here and saying that i
 
00:53:58.790 --> 00:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
believe believe firmly in science and
 
00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
science is an uncertain thing it doesn't
 
00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:03.430 align:start position:0%
science is an uncertain thing it doesn't
purport

00:54:03.430 --> 00:54:03.440 align:start position:0%
purport
 
00:54:05.430 --> 00:54:05.440 align:start position:0%
to know everything in fact the opposite
 
00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
science is about inquiry
 
00:54:09.910 --> 00:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
and we need to be doing more inquiry
 
00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:11.430 align:start position:0%
and we need to be doing more inquiry
here

00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:54:13.510 --> 00:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
and then but we do at some point need to
 
00:54:15.670 --> 00:54:15.680 align:start position:0%
look at the data that we get and make
 
00:54:17.829 --> 00:54:17.839 align:start position:0%
some decisions based on that
 
00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:18.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:54:20.470 --> 00:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
00:54:22.549 --> 00:54:22.559 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
00:54:24.870 --> 00:54:24.880 align:start position:0%
next up is alexandra
 
00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:36.549 align:start position:0%
next up is alexandra
manela

00:54:36.549 --> 00:54:36.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:40.390 --> 00:54:40.400 align:start position:0%
okay good morning i'm alexandra mannella
 
00:54:42.230 --> 00:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
and i'm not going to state any
 
00:54:44.309 --> 00:54:44.319 align:start position:0%
scientific studies
 
00:54:44.319 --> 00:54:45.030 align:start position:0%
scientific studies
or

00:54:45.030 --> 00:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:46.549 align:start position:0%
or
statistics

00:54:46.549 --> 00:54:46.559 align:start position:0%
statistics
 
00:54:48.470 --> 00:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
because i don't think those things
 
00:54:51.589 --> 00:54:51.599 align:start position:0%
matter in this case
 
00:54:54.470 --> 00:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
i don't need those things to know that
 
00:54:58.150 --> 00:54:58.160 align:start position:0%
my civil rights are being violated
 
00:55:00.710 --> 00:55:00.720 align:start position:0%
and i don't need those things
 
00:55:02.549 --> 00:55:02.559 align:start position:0%
none of those things matter they don't
 
00:55:02.559 --> 00:55:03.829 align:start position:0%
none of those things matter they don't
justify

00:55:03.829 --> 00:55:03.839 align:start position:0%
justify
 
00:55:05.589 --> 00:55:05.599 align:start position:0%
mandates in this case so i'm not going
 
00:55:06.789 --> 00:55:06.799 align:start position:0%
to go there i'm not going to talk about
 
00:55:06.799 --> 00:55:08.069 align:start position:0%
to go there i'm not going to talk about
statistics

00:55:08.069 --> 00:55:08.079 align:start position:0%
statistics
 
00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:10.240 align:start position:0%
or science that's not what matters right
 
00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:11.589 align:start position:0%
or science that's not what matters right
now

00:55:11.589 --> 00:55:11.599 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:55:15.430 --> 00:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
i'm going to briefly comment on hb 220.
 
00:55:17.910 --> 00:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
i think it's a good start
 
00:55:19.750 --> 00:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
but there's a couple of things i would
 
00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:21.349 align:start position:0%
but there's a couple of things i would
change

00:55:21.349 --> 00:55:21.359 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:55:23.910 --> 00:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
so it states in paragraph one
 
00:55:25.510 --> 00:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
every person has the natural essential
 
00:55:28.309 --> 00:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
and inherent right to bodily integrity
 
00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
free from any threat or compulsion by
 
00:55:32.230 --> 00:55:32.240 align:start position:0%
government to accept an immunization
 
00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
and i would add here a medical procedure
 
00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
right because i i added this in because
 
00:55:39.829 --> 00:55:39.839 align:start position:0%
i'm not really sure how far this
 
00:55:41.349 --> 00:55:41.359 align:start position:0%
hysteria can go
 
00:55:43.270 --> 00:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
it starts with immunizations and
 
00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:44.870 align:start position:0%
it starts with immunizations and
vaccines

00:55:44.870 --> 00:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
vaccines
 
00:55:46.829 --> 00:55:46.839 align:start position:0%
but who knows where this will lead
 
00:55:50.470 --> 00:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
us i continue accordingly no person may
 
00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
accordingly no person may be compelled
 
00:55:57.750 --> 00:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
to receive an immunization
 
00:56:00.069 --> 00:56:00.079 align:start position:0%
it originally said for covet 19 but i
 
00:56:01.510 --> 00:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
would cross that out
 
00:56:03.589 --> 00:56:03.599 align:start position:0%
and again add a medical procedure in
 
00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
order to secure receive
 
00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
or access any public facility any public
 
00:56:10.630 --> 00:56:10.640 align:start position:0%
benefit or any public service from the
 
00:56:12.789 --> 00:56:12.799 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire or any political
 
00:56:14.470 --> 00:56:14.480 align:start position:0%

this shall apply to all private entities

new hampshire
 
00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:33.440 align:start position:0%
now i am not up here advocating
 
00:56:35.430 --> 00:56:35.440 align:start position:0%
for more laws
 
00:56:37.109 --> 00:56:37.119 align:start position:0%
right i'm not happy that we need 32
 
00:56:37.119 --> 00:56:38.230 align:start position:0%
right i'm not happy that we need 32
bills

00:56:38.230 --> 00:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:56:40.710 --> 00:56:40.720 align:start position:0%
to try to protect our inherent rights
 
00:56:42.470 --> 00:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
that's insane to me
 
00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:44.240 align:start position:0%
i'm not advocating for more government
 
00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
intervention or for socialism as our
 
00:56:50.309 --> 00:56:50.319 align:start position:0%
government as our governor would call it
 
00:56:52.150 --> 00:56:52.160 align:start position:0%
but right now we're in the middle of a
 
00:56:54.870 --> 00:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
massive assault on our civil rights
 
00:56:56.549 --> 00:56:56.559 align:start position:0%
under the guise of public health and
 
00:56:56.559 --> 00:56:58.230 align:start position:0%
under the guise of public health and
safety

00:56:58.230 --> 00:56:58.240 align:start position:0%
safety
 
00:56:59.829 --> 00:56:59.839 align:start position:0%
your constituents
 
00:57:02.150 --> 00:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
are being threatened by their employers
 
00:57:03.910 --> 00:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
for not injecting pharmaceuticals into
 
00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
their bodies
 
00:57:06.630 --> 00:57:06.640 align:start position:0%
they're being forced to submit
 
00:57:08.870 --> 00:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
themselves to regular medical testing
 
00:57:10.829 --> 00:57:10.839 align:start position:0%
and absurd mask wearing
 
00:57:13.030 --> 00:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
rituals they're being harassed by their
 
00:57:14.950 --> 00:57:14.960 align:start position:0%
hr departments to disclose their
 
00:57:17.990 --> 00:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:20.630 --> 00:57:20.640 align:start position:0%
right none of this is acceptable
 
00:57:21.829 --> 00:57:21.839 align:start position:0%
and sadly we're starting to get
 
00:57:25.510 --> 00:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
accustomed to this as a society
 
00:57:27.349 --> 00:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
so i ask you do you really think that
 
00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
coercing people into taking drugs and
 
00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:31.030 align:start position:0%
coercing people into taking drugs and
treating

00:57:31.030 --> 00:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
treating
 
00:57:33.349 --> 00:57:33.359 align:start position:0%
human beings like their farm animals
 
00:57:37.030 --> 00:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
advances humanity in any meaningful way
 
00:57:40.150 --> 00:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
this is barbaric
 
00:57:42.150 --> 00:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
healthy people as if they're sick and
 
00:57:44.069 --> 00:57:44.079 align:start position:0%
forcing them to consume drugs is
 
00:57:44.079 --> 00:57:45.270 align:start position:0%
forcing them to consume drugs is
barbaric

00:57:45.270 --> 00:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
barbaric
 
00:57:48.150 --> 00:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
and it's our duty and your duty
 
00:57:50.150 --> 00:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
to put an end to this
 
00:57:52.069 --> 00:57:52.079 align:start position:0%
and to put an end to the stranglehold
 
00:57:57.030 --> 00:57:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:59.589 --> 00:57:59.599 align:start position:0%
the science is nowhere near settled
 
00:58:04.710 --> 00:58:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:06.230 --> 00:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't have to beg for exemptions
 
00:58:07.349 --> 00:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
for our jobs we shouldn't have to be
 
00:58:08.950 --> 00:58:08.960 align:start position:0%
justifying our religious beliefs to our
 
00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:11.750 align:start position:0%
justifying our religious beliefs to our
employers

00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:13.829 --> 00:58:13.839 align:start position:0%
right we don't want exemptions we just
 
00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:19.510 --> 00:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
so again i don't want any more laws on
 
00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:20.960 align:start position:0%
the books but we're sort of running out
 
00:58:25.190 --> 00:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:27.030 --> 00:58:27.040 align:start position:0%
right now we're looking to our elected
 
00:58:29.030 --> 00:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
leaders to defend our civil rights like
 
00:58:31.670 --> 00:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
we pay them our taxes to do
 
00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
but over the past two years
 
00:58:36.470 --> 00:58:36.480 align:start position:0%
they've failed us in many ways
 
00:58:38.150 --> 00:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
and again i say we're running out of
 
00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:39.190 align:start position:0%
and again i say we're running out of
options

00:58:39.190 --> 00:58:39.200 align:start position:0%
options
 
00:58:42.710 --> 00:58:42.720 align:start position:0%
to live peaceable and quiet lives here
 
00:58:44.470 --> 00:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
this is not the last pandemic that we're
 
00:58:46.309 --> 00:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
going to go through
 
00:58:48.309 --> 00:58:48.319 align:start position:0%
but i want you all to know that there is
 
00:58:50.789 --> 00:58:50.799 align:start position:0%
no emergency in this world
 
00:58:52.870 --> 00:58:52.880 align:start position:0%
even if half of the planet was dropping
 
00:58:54.470 --> 00:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
dead from a pandemic
 
00:58:56.549 --> 00:58:56.559 align:start position:0%
that justifies the suspension of our
 
00:58:56.559 --> 00:58:57.589 align:start position:0%
that justifies the suspension of our
natural

00:58:57.589 --> 00:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
natural
 
00:58:57.599 --> 00:58:58.789 align:start position:0%
natural
inherent

00:58:58.789 --> 00:58:58.799 align:start position:0%
inherent
 
00:58:58.799 --> 00:59:00.150 align:start position:0%
inherent
rights

00:59:00.150 --> 00:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
rights
 
00:59:02.309 --> 00:59:02.319 align:start position:0%
and our individual liberties
 
00:59:03.670 --> 00:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
it is not the role of our elected
 
00:59:06.789 --> 00:59:06.799 align:start position:0%
officials to enslave us for our own good
 
00:59:09.589 --> 00:59:09.599 align:start position:0%
we do not pay you to do this
 
00:59:11.510 --> 00:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
and i'll end it here god is watching
 
00:59:13.670 --> 00:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
what we do here
 
00:59:15.910 --> 00:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
i pray for you all to turn to him
 
00:59:17.510 --> 00:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
for your guidance on these matters and
 
00:59:19.030 --> 00:59:19.040 align:start position:0%
your decision making
 
00:59:23.349 --> 00:59:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:24.789 --> 00:59:24.799 align:start position:0%
thank you alexander appreciate your
 
00:59:26.390 --> 00:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
testimonies and we have a question for
 
00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:28.150 align:start position:0%
testimonies and we have a question for
alexandria

00:59:28.150 --> 00:59:28.160 align:start position:0%
alexandria
 
00:59:32.390 --> 00:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:41.910 --> 00:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:43.430 --> 00:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
good morning can you hear me with the
 
00:59:45.510 --> 00:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
mask on
 
00:59:47.349 --> 00:59:47.359 align:start position:0%
uh yeah if we have a problem i'll let
 
00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:48.720 align:start position:0%
you know but just make sure you're up
 
00:59:50.470 --> 00:59:50.480 align:start position:0%
close and you're speaking loud okay i
 
00:59:52.789 --> 00:59:52.799 align:start position:0%
would prefer to wear the mask i am uh my
 
00:59:54.789 --> 00:59:54.799 align:start position:0%
name is diane lachance i'm from kentucky
 
00:59:56.390 --> 00:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:59:58.630 --> 00:59:58.640 align:start position:0%
um i prefer to wear the mask because i'm
 
01:00:00.549 --> 01:00:00.559 align:start position:0%
not vaccinated and i
 
01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
i have to say i'm being denied the
 
01:00:03.589 --> 01:00:03.599 align:start position:0%
vaccine because i'm being denied
 
01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
important information about my medical
 
01:00:06.789 --> 01:00:06.799 align:start position:0%
health in order to make the appropriate
 
01:00:08.950 --> 01:00:08.960 align:start position:0%
decision for myself
 
01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:10.950 align:start position:0%
decision for myself
and

01:00:10.950 --> 01:00:10.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
i i come here a little bit unprepared
 
01:00:15.030 --> 01:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
because i've been spending countless
 
01:00:17.349 --> 01:00:17.359 align:start position:0%
hours watching the fda hearings from
 
01:00:19.990 --> 01:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
start to finish and your meeting and
 
01:00:22.069 --> 01:00:22.079 align:start position:0%
realized that my opportunity to speak
 
01:00:22.079 --> 01:00:23.109 align:start position:0%
realized that my opportunity to speak
was

01:00:23.109 --> 01:00:23.119 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
coming to a close and i better come down
 
01:00:27.109 --> 01:00:27.119 align:start position:0%
and just speak from my heart and hope
 
01:00:27.119 --> 01:00:28.470 align:start position:0%
and just speak from my heart and hope
that

01:00:28.470 --> 01:00:28.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:00:33.109 --> 01:00:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:34.309 --> 01:00:34.319 align:start position:0%
i agree
 
01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
with the people who speak about wanting
 
01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
data i think it's very important and
 
01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:41.349 align:start position:0%
data i think it's very important and
misinformation

01:00:41.349 --> 01:00:41.359 align:start position:0%
misinformation
 
01:00:41.359 --> 01:00:43.030 align:start position:0%
misinformation
today

01:00:43.030 --> 01:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:00:45.190 --> 01:00:45.200 align:start position:0%
makes us all spend countless hours
 
01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
looking for the truth
 
01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:49.109 align:start position:0%
looking for the truth
um

01:00:49.109 --> 01:00:49.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:51.109 --> 01:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
i find it very hard to talk to people
 
01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
about what's going on with the fda and
 
01:00:56.150 --> 01:00:56.160 align:start position:0%
the cdc and the formulation of this
 
01:00:57.670 --> 01:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
vaccine because
 
01:00:59.109 --> 01:00:59.119 align:start position:0%
people don't even feel like they are
 
01:01:00.870 --> 01:01:00.880 align:start position:0%
smart enough to watch those hearings and
 
01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:02.640 align:start position:0%
i will tell you that most of the
 
01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:03.920 align:start position:0%
scientists who speak i don't know what
 
01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
they're talking about but i have to say
 
01:01:06.950 --> 01:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
they're very intelligent people and they
 
01:01:09.430 --> 01:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
make very intelligent conclusions that
 
01:01:11.589 --> 01:01:11.599 align:start position:0%
the layperson can understand i have a
 
01:01:13.349 --> 01:01:13.359 align:start position:0%
brother as a nuclear engineer if i ask
 
01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
him a question about the nuclear
 
01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:15.829 align:start position:0%
him a question about the nuclear
industry

01:01:15.829 --> 01:01:15.839 align:start position:0%
industry
 
01:01:17.829 --> 01:01:17.839 align:start position:0%
he knows how to talk to people who don't
 
01:01:19.990 --> 01:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
understand it
 
01:01:21.589 --> 01:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
so i would encourage people to watch
 
01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
those hearings because if you do i think
 
01:01:26.309 --> 01:01:26.319 align:start position:0%
you might come up to the same conclusion
 
01:01:28.069 --> 01:01:28.079 align:start position:0%
that i am is that
 
01:01:28.079 --> 01:01:30.630 align:start position:0%
that i am is that
um

01:01:30.630 --> 01:01:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:32.710 --> 01:01:32.720 align:start position:0%
there's still a lot of data that we
 
01:01:34.069 --> 01:01:34.079 align:start position:0%
don't have
 
01:01:36.150 --> 01:01:36.160 align:start position:0%
they claim that working at the speed of
 
01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:37.190 align:start position:0%
they claim that working at the speed of
science

01:01:37.190 --> 01:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
science
 
01:01:39.589 --> 01:01:39.599 align:start position:0%
i worked for a pharmaceutical research
 
01:01:42.549 --> 01:01:42.559 align:start position:0%
and manufacturing company for 18 years
 
01:01:44.870 --> 01:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
i know very well the speed of science it
 
01:01:47.589 --> 01:01:47.599 align:start position:0%
is not fast
 
01:01:51.589 --> 01:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:51.599 --> 01:01:52.549 align:start position:0%
 
if

01:01:52.549 --> 01:01:52.559 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:01:53.750 --> 01:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
people who are concerned about us
 
01:01:55.349 --> 01:01:55.359 align:start position:0%
getting the right data
 
01:01:58.309 --> 01:01:58.319 align:start position:0%
um want to champion something um how
 
01:02:00.549 --> 01:02:00.559 align:start position:0%
about let's talk about the vares reports
 
01:02:02.150 --> 01:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
let's have a really honest discussion
 
01:02:03.829 --> 01:02:03.839 align:start position:0%
about what that data
 
01:02:03.839 --> 01:02:06.950 align:start position:0%
about what that data
means

01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:10.230 --> 01:02:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:12.309 --> 01:02:12.319 align:start position:0%
i don't know what the right word is um
 
01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
still trying to sort out
 
01:02:15.430 --> 01:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
what i heard
 
01:02:17.430 --> 01:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
at the
 
01:02:19.589 --> 01:02:19.599 align:start position:0%
fda approval meeting for the five to 11
 
01:02:21.910 --> 01:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
year olds and that was a i believe and
 
01:02:23.829 --> 01:02:23.839 align:start position:0%
again i don't i've been spending a lot
 
01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:26.240 align:start position:0%
of time and i only have so much time and
 
01:02:27.990 --> 01:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
i will say i wish you'd have one more
 
01:02:29.430 --> 01:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
public meeting next week and i would
 
01:02:31.270 --> 01:02:31.280 align:start position:0%
promise to come with a prepared script
 
01:02:33.670 --> 01:02:33.680 align:start position:0%
and much more thorough
 
01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:35.430 align:start position:0%
and much more thorough
testimony

01:02:35.430 --> 01:02:35.440 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:36.470 align:start position:0%
testimony
because

01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
in a little bit of time i had to look
 
01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:39.190 align:start position:0%
in a little bit of time i had to look
into

01:02:39.190 --> 01:02:39.200 align:start position:0%
into
 
01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
the v-safe app that was rolled out with
 
01:02:44.789 --> 01:02:44.799 align:start position:0%
the 5-11
 
01:02:44.799 --> 01:02:46.710 align:start position:0%
the 5-11
approval

01:02:46.710 --> 01:02:46.720 align:start position:0%
approval
 
01:02:48.710 --> 01:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
from what i can see
 
01:02:51.510 --> 01:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
parents can enroll their children let
 
01:02:52.870 --> 01:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
them know they have that vaccine or any
 
01:02:55.750 --> 01:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
vaccine that they have ever had
 
01:02:57.510 --> 01:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
and they will get notifications when
 
01:03:00.950 --> 01:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
vaccines are due and parents can also
 
01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
log in that they've had an adverse
 
01:03:05.109 --> 01:03:05.119 align:start position:0%
reaction their child
 
01:03:07.589 --> 01:03:07.599 align:start position:0%
and there's already been some talk
 
01:03:09.349 --> 01:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
that parents are going to believe that
 
01:03:12.230 --> 01:03:12.240 align:start position:0%
they have reported an adverse event this
 
01:03:14.230 --> 01:03:14.240 align:start position:0%
app and it clearly states it on the
 
01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:16.470 align:start position:0%
app and it clearly states it on the
website

01:03:16.470 --> 01:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
website
 
01:03:17.990 --> 01:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
is not theirs
 
01:03:22.470 --> 01:03:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:24.549 --> 01:03:24.559 align:start position:0%
the speed at which we all
 
01:03:27.349 --> 01:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
operate and use apps and whatever i
 
01:03:29.029 --> 01:03:29.039 align:start position:0%
think is another danger because i don't
 
01:03:31.190 --> 01:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
think parents understand that if their
 
01:03:33.430 --> 01:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
child has a severe reaction i'm sure the
 
01:03:34.549 --> 01:03:34.559 align:start position:0%
first thing they're going to do is go to
 
01:03:35.829 --> 01:03:35.839 align:start position:0%
that app because the first thing they
 
01:03:37.270 --> 01:03:37.280 align:start position:0%
want is medical attention for their
 
01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:38.230 align:start position:0%
want is medical attention for their
child

01:03:38.230 --> 01:03:38.240 align:start position:0%
child
 
01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:40.160 align:start position:0%
but how many are going to assume
 
01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
that that data
 
01:03:44.470 --> 01:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
is being looked at for the study
 
01:03:46.870 --> 01:03:46.880 align:start position:0%
how long will it take for us to get that
 
01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:47.829 align:start position:0%
how long will it take for us to get that
data

01:03:47.829 --> 01:03:47.839 align:start position:0%
data
 
01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
to understand what is happening with the
 
01:03:51.910 --> 01:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
five to 11 year olds if it's not going
 
01:03:53.190 --> 01:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
into theirs or there's a
 
01:03:54.470 --> 01:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding against we're going to
 
01:03:56.870 --> 01:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
have some more backlogged data i see it
 
01:03:59.430 --> 01:03:59.440 align:start position:0%
as a double accounting system which
 
01:04:02.309 --> 01:04:02.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't belong anywhere
 
01:04:04.870 --> 01:04:04.880 align:start position:0%
um and i think this committee i would
 
01:04:06.870 --> 01:04:06.880 align:start position:0%
implore you to look at that
 
01:04:07.990 --> 01:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
the v
 
01:04:10.470 --> 01:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
safe program is so new that wikipedia
 
01:04:13.270 --> 01:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't even have a article about it yet
 
01:04:14.470 --> 01:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
so i
 
01:04:15.829 --> 01:04:15.839 align:start position:0%
we're going to all be
 
01:04:17.910 --> 01:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
going on facebook and hearing this
 
01:04:19.910 --> 01:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
information like people have warned
 
01:04:21.510 --> 01:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
against and real information but we're
 
01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
not going to know what it is so
 
01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
the new information i bring to you is
 
01:04:29.109 --> 01:04:29.119 align:start position:0%
the v safe
 
01:04:31.829 --> 01:04:31.839 align:start position:0%
app and how that is
 
01:04:33.510 --> 01:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
going to help our hurt
 
01:04:35.589 --> 01:04:35.599 align:start position:0%
this conversation and the ability for us
 
01:04:37.430 --> 01:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
all to make the right decision for
 
01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:39.270 align:start position:0%
all to make the right decision for
ourselves

01:04:39.270 --> 01:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
ourselves
 
01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
i just want to check real quick some
 
01:04:48.549 --> 01:04:48.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:50.230 --> 01:04:50.240 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that the majority
 
01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:51.270 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that the majority
opinion

01:04:51.270 --> 01:04:51.280 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
01:04:53.829 --> 01:04:53.839 align:start position:0%
is what our constitution
 
01:04:55.990 --> 01:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
intended to be the dictator of what we
 
01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.270 align:start position:0%
intended to be the dictator of what we
do

01:04:57.270 --> 01:04:57.280 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:04:57.280 --> 01:04:58.710 align:start position:0%
do
um

01:04:58.710 --> 01:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:58.720 --> 01:04:59.829 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:04:59.829 --> 01:04:59.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
with that i'm just going to say you know
 
01:05:04.390 --> 01:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
if that's how some people think
 
01:05:06.710 --> 01:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
saint anselm's public policy did a
 
01:05:09.990 --> 01:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
recent poll and it says that most people
 
01:05:11.029 --> 01:05:11.039 align:start position:0%
although they
 
01:05:12.549 --> 01:05:12.559 align:start position:0%
agree with the vaccine
 
01:05:14.549 --> 01:05:14.559 align:start position:0%
don't agree with the mandate
 
01:05:15.750 --> 01:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
i'm just throwing that out to the people
 
01:05:18.390 --> 01:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
who believe that majority opinion is
 
01:05:22.150 --> 01:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
what should determine our decisions
 
01:05:24.069 --> 01:05:24.079 align:start position:0%
i'm going to stop there because i am not
 
01:05:25.430 --> 01:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
real prepared and i don't want to just
 
01:05:27.750 --> 01:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
ramble on um i'm just going to again
 
01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:28.710 align:start position:0%
ramble on um i'm just going to again
repeat

01:05:28.710 --> 01:05:28.720 align:start position:0%
repeat
 
01:05:30.870 --> 01:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
please check the v safe everyone take a
 
01:05:32.230 --> 01:05:32.240 align:start position:0%
look at it i'd like to hear what people
 
01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
have to say about it
 
01:05:36.630 --> 01:05:36.640 align:start position:0%
i believe it's a double data
 
01:05:38.470 --> 01:05:38.480 align:start position:0%
collection i think we're not going to
 
01:05:40.150 --> 01:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
get information as quickly as we need
 
01:05:41.990 --> 01:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
important information so i thank you
 
01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:51.029 --> 01:05:51.039 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you any questions
 
01:05:53.430 --> 01:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i do want to correct
 
01:05:55.589 --> 01:05:55.599 align:start position:0%
something i said i said earlier that
 
01:05:57.589 --> 01:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
there were roughly seven thousand
 
01:05:59.430 --> 01:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh reported covert deaths that were
 
01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
related to and i quote
 
01:06:03.750 --> 01:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
intentional unintentional injury or
 
01:06:05.349 --> 01:06:05.359 align:start position:0%
poisonings and that number is really
 
01:06:07.670 --> 01:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
fifteen thousand one hundred not seven
 
01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:10.390 align:start position:0%
fifteen thousand one hundred not seven
thousand

01:06:10.390 --> 01:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:13.349 --> 01:06:13.359 align:start position:0%
all right next up is
 
01:06:29.510 --> 01:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:31.589 align:start position:0%

hampshire
 
01:06:36.950 --> 01:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for giving us the opportunity
 
01:06:39.190 --> 01:06:39.200 align:start position:0%
to speak today
 
01:06:40.870 --> 01:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
i understand that this committee is
 
01:06:43.270 --> 01:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
reviewing a vast array of bills related
 
01:06:46.230 --> 01:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
to immunizations
 
01:06:48.549 --> 01:06:48.559 align:start position:0%
i am cautiously hopeful that your
 
01:06:50.470 --> 01:06:50.480 align:start position:0%
reasons for wanting our input in these
 
01:06:53.349 --> 01:06:53.359 align:start position:0%
sessions is because you do in fact
 
01:06:55.990 --> 01:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
plan to utilize it as we are asking in
 
01:06:59.109 --> 01:06:59.119 align:start position:0%
your roles as elected officials
 
01:07:00.710 --> 01:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
i'm one of your new hampshire residents
 
01:07:02.549 --> 01:07:02.559 align:start position:0%
that has been begging and pleading for
 
01:07:04.630 --> 01:07:04.640 align:start position:0%
you to stand up for the live free or die
 
01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:06.470 align:start position:0%
you to stand up for the live free or die
state

01:07:06.470 --> 01:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:07:08.309 --> 01:07:08.319 align:start position:0%

and i love my life here because i love
 
01:07:17.990 --> 01:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
what new hampshire had to offer and what
 
01:07:19.829 --> 01:07:19.839 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has afforded to myself and
 
01:07:21.589 --> 01:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
my family
 
01:07:24.470 --> 01:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
i'm also the daughter of a nurse
 
01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
a nurse whose career has spanned 47
 
01:07:29.990 --> 01:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
years who cannot be here today to speak
 
01:07:32.549 --> 01:07:32.559 align:start position:0%
but faces the same fate as i and so many
 
01:07:34.470 --> 01:07:34.480 align:start position:0%
here today
 
01:07:37.029 --> 01:07:37.039 align:start position:0%
my mother a nurse of 47 years a woman

who has dedicated her life to caring for
 
01:07:43.190 --> 01:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
others will lose her job in five days
 
01:07:45.190 --> 01:07:45.200 align:start position:0%
due to the vaccine mandate
 
01:07:47.510 --> 01:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
a nurse who contracted kovid while
 
01:07:49.430 --> 01:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
working through the pandemic but never
 
01:07:51.190 --> 01:07:51.200 align:start position:0%
missed a beat
 
01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
now despite her antibodies still showing
 
01:07:56.390 --> 01:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
nine months later
 
01:07:58.390 --> 01:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
will have her career ended in a way that
 
01:08:00.950 --> 01:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
couldn't be more degrading giving her 47
 
01:08:03.430 --> 01:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
years of devoted service and faithful
 
01:08:05.750 --> 01:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
service to the care of others
 
01:08:07.990 --> 01:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
her provider would not sign off on her
 
01:08:09.589 --> 01:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
medical exemption
 
01:08:11.589 --> 01:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
despite the adverse and very scary
 
01:08:13.670 --> 01:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
vaccination and immunization history
 
01:08:15.589 --> 01:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
that she has
 
01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
she has submitted a religious exemption
 
01:08:19.510 --> 01:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
based on her sincerely held beliefs but
 
01:08:21.829 --> 01:08:21.839 align:start position:0%
to date we have no response and based on
 
01:08:23.590 --> 01:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
what so many others in the health care
 
01:08:25.510 --> 01:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
field have been communicating these
 
01:08:29.030 --> 01:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
exemptions are all being denied
 
01:08:31.189 --> 01:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
so our employers and this administration
 
01:08:33.590 --> 01:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
has been given license to be judge jury
 
01:08:36.149 --> 01:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
and executioner of our faith as well as
 
01:08:36.159 --> 01:08:36.829 align:start position:0%
and executioner of our faith as well as
our

01:08:36.829 --> 01:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
bodies i myself have worked in the
 
01:08:41.510 --> 01:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
healthcare field for 15 years
 
01:08:43.910 --> 01:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
i lost my job at dartmouth-hitchcock
 
01:08:45.749 --> 01:08:45.759 align:start position:0%
on october the 8th
 
01:08:48.470 --> 01:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
i was there for 14 years
 
01:08:53.269 --> 01:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
and ate as a remote only employee
 
01:08:55.749 --> 01:08:55.759 align:start position:0%
doing prior authorizations i like my
 
01:08:58.470 --> 01:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
mother had coveted too i have antibodies
 
01:09:01.110 --> 01:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
a full 10 months later
 
01:09:03.669 --> 01:09:03.679 align:start position:0%
my medical exemption was denied
 
01:09:06.149 --> 01:09:06.159 align:start position:0%
despite my documented history of severe
 
01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
allergic reactions
 
01:09:10.070 --> 01:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
despite a letter from my primary care
 
01:09:13.269 --> 01:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
stating i should not get this vaccine
 
01:09:15.749 --> 01:09:15.759 align:start position:0%
despite my antibody test and despite my
 
01:09:18.390 --> 01:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
plea of abject fear that as a mother of
 
01:09:21.269 --> 01:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
a young child with my history of very
 
01:09:21.279 --> 01:09:22.950 align:start position:0%
a young child with my history of very
visceral

01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
visceral
 
01:09:25.269 --> 01:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
and horrific reactions to immunizations
 
01:09:27.910 --> 01:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
that i was afraid to die
 
01:09:29.910 --> 01:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
darth hitchcock sent me my denial for
 
01:09:31.749 --> 01:09:31.759 align:start position:0%
the covid vaccine
 
01:09:33.749 --> 01:09:33.759 align:start position:0%
my approval for the flu vaccine
 
01:09:36.709 --> 01:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
exemption as i have had for 10 years
 
01:09:39.510 --> 01:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
and my termination paperwork
 
01:09:42.149 --> 01:09:42.159 align:start position:0%
14 years gone
 
01:09:44.470 --> 01:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
and the kicker is three days after i was
 
01:09:46.309 --> 01:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
terminated for not complying with the
 
01:09:48.630 --> 01:09:48.640 align:start position:0%
vaccination because my natural immunity
 
01:09:50.950 --> 01:09:50.960 align:start position:0%
meant nothing despite what history has
 
01:09:52.950 --> 01:09:52.960 align:start position:0%
always told us about prior infections
 
01:09:54.709 --> 01:09:54.719 align:start position:0%
and antibodies
 
01:09:57.350 --> 01:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
the red cross called me to ask me if i
 
01:09:59.430 --> 01:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
would donate more blood because i'm a
 
01:10:02.709 --> 01:10:02.719 align:start position:0%
universal donor with covet antibodies
 
01:10:04.630 --> 01:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
my natural immunity was good enough to
 
01:10:06.550 --> 01:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
donate blood to help persons recover
 
01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
from covid but not good enough to keep
 
01:10:13.189 --> 01:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
i face the same at my current employer
 
01:10:19.110 --> 01:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
our date is 11 15 i will lose my health
 
01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
insurance and the ability to care for my
 
01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:21.990 align:start position:0%
insurance and the ability to care for my
daughter

01:10:21.990 --> 01:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
daughter
 
01:10:23.990 --> 01:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
i have again applied for exemptions but
 
01:10:25.590 --> 01:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
to date have received no response
 
01:10:27.910 --> 01:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
despite my efforts to follow up
 
01:10:29.350 --> 01:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
if it goes anything like it did at
 
01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
dartmouth i will essentially be homeless
 
01:10:34.470 --> 01:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
on monday along with my mother
 
01:10:36.790 --> 01:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
dr strang pointed earlier in this week
 
01:10:39.189 --> 01:10:39.199 align:start position:0%
to informed consent cannot be defined in
 
01:10:40.630 --> 01:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
this situation
 
01:10:42.790 --> 01:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
this is not patient centered
 
01:10:44.950 --> 01:10:44.960 align:start position:0%
these mandates and the inaction of our
 
01:10:46.790 --> 01:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
elected officials to clarify what they
 
01:10:50.149 --> 01:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
mean for new hampshire has led to chaos
 
01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
employers are so fearful to not be able
 
01:10:55.830 --> 01:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
to report a business-wide 99 vaccination
 
01:10:57.430 --> 01:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
rate that they're willing to terminate
 
01:10:59.750 --> 01:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
healthcare workers who for their entire
 
01:11:02.390 --> 01:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
careers pandemic aside
 
01:11:04.470 --> 01:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
have been unwavering in their care of
 
01:11:06.310 --> 01:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
all of us
 
01:11:08.709 --> 01:11:08.719 align:start position:0%
when have we had press announcements of
 
01:11:11.189 --> 01:11:11.199 align:start position:0%
business flu vaccination rates i tried
 
01:11:13.590 --> 01:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
to look i couldn't find any major
 
01:11:15.350 --> 01:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
announcements about the compliance of
 
01:11:17.669 --> 01:11:17.679 align:start position:0%
flu from any institutions
 
01:11:20.149 --> 01:11:20.159 align:start position:0%
back in 2010 when they began
 
01:11:21.990 --> 01:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
mandating the flu vaccine in the health
 
01:11:24.310 --> 01:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
care setting the vaccine had been out
 
01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
and fda approved since 2007
 
01:11:31.110 --> 01:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
and the nasal flu since 2003
 
01:11:33.270 --> 01:11:33.280 align:start position:0%
so for the vaccine three whole years of
 
01:11:35.350 --> 01:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
data people had to review before making
 
01:11:37.669 --> 01:11:37.679 align:start position:0%
the decision to be vaccinated
 
01:11:41.830 --> 01:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
it's november 10 2021 the covid vaccine
 
01:11:43.910 --> 01:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
under emergency use has been available
 
01:11:45.750 --> 01:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
to the general public for less than one
 
01:11:47.669 --> 01:11:47.679 align:start position:0%
full year still
 
01:11:50.550 --> 01:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
and still the fda approved one only came
 
01:11:54.149 --> 01:11:54.159 align:start position:0%
in august so less than three months why
 
01:11:56.310 --> 01:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
was it okay for the flu vaccine to allow
 
01:11:58.149 --> 01:11:58.159 align:start position:0%
people to take the time to review the
 
01:12:00.310 --> 01:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
data and decide but now we're being
 
01:12:02.550 --> 01:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
forced to choose between taking care of
 
01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
our families
 
01:12:05.990 --> 01:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
our careers for less than a year's worth
 
01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
of real-time data
 
01:12:10.470 --> 01:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
why does new hampshire's own laws allow
 
01:12:12.630 --> 01:12:12.640 align:start position:0%
for natural immunity as an exemption to
 
01:12:15.590 --> 01:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
vaccination but not for this one
 
01:12:17.910 --> 01:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
is it because we used to use history and
 
01:12:20.630 --> 01:12:20.640 align:start position:0%
historical data prior to covid
 
01:12:23.110 --> 01:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
and while the covet 19 is a newer virus
 
01:12:24.870 --> 01:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
it would seem that everything that came
 
01:12:27.030 --> 01:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
before in history from mass studies to
 
01:12:29.350 --> 01:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
natural immunity was just thrown out the
 
01:12:32.070 --> 01:12:32.080 align:start position:0%
proverbial window
 
01:12:34.470 --> 01:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
and despite the fda advisory committee
 
01:12:36.950 --> 01:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
stating quote we're never going to learn
 
01:12:39.590 --> 01:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
about how safe this vaccine is unless we
 
01:12:41.030 --> 01:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
start giving it
 
01:12:42.550 --> 01:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
one of our very own new hampshire
 
01:12:45.270 --> 01:12:45.280 align:start position:0%
representatives put in an lsr to require
 
01:12:47.430 --> 01:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
the covid vaccine in order to attend
 
01:12:49.430 --> 01:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
public school
 
01:12:51.669 --> 01:12:51.679 align:start position:0%
public school
 
01:12:54.229 --> 01:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
free fair and appropriate education but
 
01:12:56.149 --> 01:12:56.159 align:start position:0%
only if you vaccinate your child and
 
01:12:58.390 --> 01:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
hope it's safe
 
01:13:00.950 --> 01:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
the nih is quietly studying the effects
 
01:13:02.870 --> 01:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
of this vaccine on women's menstrual
 
01:13:07.030 --> 01:13:07.040 align:start position:0%

they had been given a grant for 1.67

million dollars
 
01:13:16.149 --> 01:13:16.159 align:start position:0%
to study the correlation of the covid

changes
 
01:13:25.669 --> 01:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
but you want me as a mother and a woman
 
01:13:27.270 --> 01:13:27.280 align:start position:0%
to give this to my seven-year-old
 
01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:28.870 align:start position:0%

daughter

in a society to attend school knowing i
 
01:13:33.990 --> 01:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
could potentially be altering her
 
01:13:36.229 --> 01:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
ovaries or causing permanent damaging
 
01:13:38.310 --> 01:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
hormonal changes to her body at seven
 
01:13:39.590 --> 01:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
years old
 
01:13:42.790 --> 01:13:42.800 align:start position:0%

of recovery from
 
01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
also shouldn't this study the nih is
 
01:13:49.750 --> 01:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
doing be enough for women in the
 
01:13:51.590 --> 01:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
workforce to be medically exempt from
 
01:13:53.830 --> 01:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
the vaccine at this time
 
01:13:55.590 --> 01:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
at least until the study is completed
 
01:13:57.669 --> 01:13:57.679 align:start position:0%
and vetted
 
01:13:58.790 --> 01:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
but no
 
01:14:00.709 --> 01:14:00.719 align:start position:0%
i along with my mother will lose my
 
01:14:03.030 --> 01:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
full-time job in five days
 
01:14:04.630 --> 01:14:04.640 align:start position:0%
if some of this legislation comes to
 
01:14:06.470 --> 01:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
pass this next session families will
 
01:14:08.709 --> 01:14:08.719 align:start position:0%

virus flu
 
01:16:18.310 --> 01:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
our own immune system is the best
 
01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
defense against this man-made virus
 
01:16:23.030 --> 01:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
viruses have been around since the dawn
 
01:16:24.870 --> 01:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
of time
 
01:16:27.270 --> 01:16:27.280 align:start position:0%

01:16:35.830 --> 01:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
in the form of grants and big farmer
 
01:16:37.510 --> 01:16:37.520 align:start position:0%

01:20:09.750 --> 01:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
will repeat itself
 
01:20:12.070 --> 01:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
okay i like to end on that note
 
01:20:14.149 --> 01:20:14.159 align:start position:0%

or webpage that labels me as an
 
01:20:17.669 --> 01:20:17.679 align:start position:0%
anti-vaxxer or

other defaming name you will have legal
 
01:20:21.669 --> 01:20:21.679 align:start position:0%
action taken against you
 
01:20:27.510 --> 01:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:29.990 --> 01:20:30.000 align:start position:0%

01:20:50.070 --> 01:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:51.830 --> 01:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
01:20:54.310 --> 01:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
board committee and good morning we are
 
01:20:57.510 --> 01:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:58.950 --> 01:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
i lived
 
01:21:01.750 --> 01:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
my 50 years
 
01:21:03.189 --> 01:21:03.199 align:start position:0%
my kids
 
01:21:04.950 --> 01:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
have not yet
 
01:21:08.310 --> 01:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
my grandbabies have not yet
 
01:21:10.950 --> 01:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
they deserve the opportunity
 
01:21:13.030 --> 01:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
we all have had
 
01:21:14.550 --> 01:21:14.560 align:start position:0%
we know
 
01:21:17.510 --> 01:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
that any structure
 
01:21:19.910 --> 01:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
needs has an architect
 
01:21:21.910 --> 01:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
it needs to be built
 
01:21:24.550 --> 01:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
on solid ground
 
01:21:27.830 --> 01:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
we call new hampshire the granite state
 
01:21:33.830 --> 01:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:38.790 --> 01:21:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:42.709 --> 01:21:42.719 align:start position:0%
the most bold line on that is we the
 
01:21:42.719 --> 01:21:45.189 align:start position:0%
the most bold line on that is we the
people

01:21:45.189 --> 01:21:45.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:46.629 --> 01:21:46.639 align:start position:0%
we the people
 
01:21:50.149 --> 01:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
pay all of your salaries
 
01:21:52.470 --> 01:21:52.480 align:start position:0%
anybody that takes an oath
 
01:21:53.669 --> 01:21:53.679 align:start position:0%
to protect
 
01:21:53.679 --> 01:21:54.830 align:start position:0%
to protect
all

01:21:54.830 --> 01:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:21:57.669 --> 01:21:57.679 align:start position:0%
humanity there's a monument
 
01:21:59.189 --> 01:21:59.199 align:start position:0%
out front here
 
01:22:02.070 --> 01:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:03.910 --> 01:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
i expect
 
01:22:05.270 --> 01:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
the hearts
 
01:22:07.030 --> 01:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
of the people
 
01:22:10.629 --> 01:22:10.639 align:start position:0%
that are making these decisions
 
01:22:12.950 --> 01:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
to do the right things
 
01:22:17.189 --> 01:22:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:20.070 --> 01:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
i didn't come here with a planned speech
 
01:22:22.470 --> 01:22:22.480 align:start position:0%
i am not a public speaker
 
01:22:24.790 --> 01:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
i travel state to state
 
01:22:26.229 --> 01:22:26.239 align:start position:0%
seeking truth
 
01:22:28.470 --> 01:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
speaking truth i've been to the border
 
01:22:30.950 --> 01:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
wall i've been to the white house
 
01:22:33.830 --> 01:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
i travel from florida to the texas
 
01:22:37.189 --> 01:22:37.199 align:start position:0%
from florida to maine
 
01:22:41.350 --> 01:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
my both my grandfathers were war heroes
 
01:22:46.149 --> 01:22:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:49.030 --> 01:22:49.040 align:start position:0%
he was he swam back on the uss
 
01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:50.470 align:start position:0%
he was he swam back on the uss
independence

01:22:50.470 --> 01:22:50.480 align:start position:0%
independence
 
01:22:52.950 --> 01:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
saving lives
 
01:22:55.270 --> 01:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
he was on the uss hornet
 
01:22:58.470 --> 01:22:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:00.390 --> 01:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
he was dead
 
01:23:02.149 --> 01:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
when i was a year old
 
01:23:03.990 --> 01:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
by big pharma
 
01:23:08.070 --> 01:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:10.310 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:23:10.310 --> 01:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:11.750 --> 01:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
when are we gonna
 
01:23:13.590 --> 01:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
bring the facts
 
01:23:17.750 --> 01:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
transparency and truth because fake news
 
01:23:20.070 --> 01:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
does not do that
 
01:23:21.510 --> 01:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
so i
 
01:23:24.390 --> 01:23:24.400 align:start position:0%
am in a position where i need to be
 
01:23:27.270 --> 01:23:27.280 align:start position:0%
front line boots on the ground seeking
 
01:23:30.629 --> 01:23:30.639 align:start position:0%
the truth for we the people for my kids
 
01:23:32.790 --> 01:23:32.800 align:start position:0%
and my grandbabies
 
01:23:34.629 --> 01:23:34.639 align:start position:0%
plain and simple
 
01:23:37.030 --> 01:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
and all these people here and everybody
 
01:23:40.149 --> 01:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
that might watch this and everybody in
 
01:23:41.510 --> 01:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
every country
 
01:23:46.390 --> 01:23:46.400 align:start position:0%
every county every state every town
 
01:23:47.510 --> 01:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:23:49.189 --> 01:23:49.199 align:start position:0%
our free will
 
01:23:50.950 --> 01:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
and our free choice
 
01:23:54.470 --> 01:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
that was given to us in 1776
 
01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:55.669 align:start position:0%
that was given to us in 1776
however

01:23:55.669 --> 01:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:24:00.310 --> 01:24:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:01.350 align:start position:0%
 
started

01:24:01.350 --> 01:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
started
 
01:24:03.350 --> 01:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
to take that from us
 
01:24:04.870 --> 01:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
and if you look on the back of your
 
01:24:06.470 --> 01:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
dollar bill at the pyramid with the
 
01:24:09.030 --> 01:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
all-seeing eye
 
01:24:11.910 --> 01:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
that scares us in the face all our life
 
01:24:14.550 --> 01:24:14.560 align:start position:0%
the fake fiat currency that has no gold
 
01:24:17.270 --> 01:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
back has no backing whatsoever
 
01:24:19.510 --> 01:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
okay all this money that big farmer is
 
01:24:21.350 --> 01:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
putting in their pockets
 
01:24:24.870 --> 01:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
all our selected officials not fairly
 
01:24:26.709 --> 01:24:26.719 align:start position:0%
elected officials
 
01:24:31.830 --> 01:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
taking the seats to serve we the people
 
01:24:34.470 --> 01:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
are taking bribes
 
01:24:35.669 --> 01:24:35.679 align:start position:0%
no more
 
01:24:38.149 --> 01:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
fooling we the people
 
01:24:40.550 --> 01:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
we the people
 
01:24:42.550 --> 01:24:42.560 align:start position:0%
are taking
 
01:24:46.229 --> 01:24:46.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:49.110 --> 01:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
we are the architects
 
01:24:50.550 --> 01:24:50.560 align:start position:0%
of what
 
01:24:53.669 --> 01:24:53.679 align:start position:0%
we put in our bodies
 
01:24:57.990 --> 01:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
i don't believe in putting experimental
 
01:25:02.470 --> 01:25:02.480 align:start position:0%
drugs in my body and i don't believe
 
01:25:05.270 --> 01:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
that anybody should be forced on that i
 
01:25:07.110 --> 01:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
want to read
 
01:25:09.270 --> 01:25:09.280 align:start position:0%
the definition
 
01:25:11.510 --> 01:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
of a vaccine
 
01:25:13.430 --> 01:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
and then i'm going to break down
 
01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:14.310 align:start position:0%
and then i'm going to break down
one

01:25:14.310 --> 01:25:14.320 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:15.510 align:start position:0%
one
specific

01:25:15.510 --> 01:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
specific
 
01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:16.390 align:start position:0%
specific
word

01:25:16.390 --> 01:25:16.400 align:start position:0%
word
 
01:25:18.070 --> 01:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
in this
 
01:25:19.910 --> 01:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
so derek here you're
 
01:25:21.990 --> 01:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
i'll give you an extra a couple minutes
 
01:25:23.990 --> 01:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
but we're approaching 10 minutes now and
 
01:25:25.350 --> 01:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
so if we could
 
01:25:27.350 --> 01:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
kind of tighten it up a little bit so
 
01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
let's do this
 
01:25:30.709 --> 01:25:30.719 align:start position:0%
let's go to the mass first let's cover
 
01:25:32.550 --> 01:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
that first
 
01:25:34.149 --> 01:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
because masks
 
01:25:35.430 --> 01:25:35.440 align:start position:0%
are proven
 
01:25:39.030 --> 01:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
they do not stop viruses the package in
 
01:25:41.590 --> 01:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
the hospital with the blue mask
 
01:25:44.229 --> 01:25:44.239 align:start position:0%
states on the back therefore emergency
 
01:25:46.950 --> 01:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
only they do not stop viruses if you
 
01:25:48.310 --> 01:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
were to find
 
01:25:51.110 --> 01:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
one type of mass that is a hundred
 
01:25:54.790 --> 01:25:54.800 align:start position:0%
percent proof
 
01:25:56.870 --> 01:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
stopping a virus
 
01:25:59.830 --> 01:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
then each and every one of us would have
 
01:26:00.950 --> 01:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
to wear
 
01:26:03.189 --> 01:26:03.199 align:start position:0%
that particular mask
 
01:26:05.750 --> 01:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
we don't go make our own mask with
 
01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:07.990 align:start position:0%
we don't go make our own mask with
fabric

01:26:07.990 --> 01:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
fabric
 
01:26:11.189 --> 01:26:11.199 align:start position:0%
and say that is stopping a virus
 
01:26:13.669 --> 01:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
that is stopping your voice
 
01:26:16.229 --> 01:26:16.239 align:start position:0%
we experienced over there with a mask on
 
01:26:18.390 --> 01:26:18.400 align:start position:0%
your voice that your voice can't be
 
01:26:20.870 --> 01:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
heard clearly
 
01:26:23.030 --> 01:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
so that's the mask
 
01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:24.470 align:start position:0%
so that's the mask
situation

01:26:24.470 --> 01:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:26:26.470 --> 01:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
now this experimental
 
01:26:29.430 --> 01:26:29.440 align:start position:0%
drug that has truly not been fda
 
01:26:32.390 --> 01:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
approved only emergency only so let's
 
01:26:34.870 --> 01:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
put the facts out let's be transparent
 
01:26:36.950 --> 01:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
about things
 
01:26:38.950 --> 01:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
because that's what the world needs
 
01:26:41.270 --> 01:26:41.280 align:start position:0%
that's what we the people need we need
 
01:26:45.590 --> 01:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
transparency through out
 
01:26:49.510 --> 01:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
not when you choose to be transparent
 
01:26:51.669 --> 01:26:51.679 align:start position:0%
i don't plan speeches i don't write them
 
01:26:53.669 --> 01:26:53.679 align:start position:0%
i speak from my heart
 
01:26:53.679 --> 01:26:54.950 align:start position:0%
i speak from my heart
so

01:26:54.950 --> 01:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:26:59.830 --> 01:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
how are we forcing an experimental drug
 
01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:01.430 align:start position:0%
how are we forcing an experimental drug
that's

01:27:01.430 --> 01:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:05.510 align:start position:0%
that's
biological

01:27:05.510 --> 01:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:07.430 --> 01:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
which is stated
 
01:27:09.750 --> 01:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
in the definition of a vaccine let's

well how about we go into common
 
01:27:30.629 --> 01:27:30.639 align:start position:0%
sense law with logic
 
01:27:32.870 --> 01:27:32.880 align:start position:0%

01:29:11.830 --> 01:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
hi uh good morning my name is josie
 
01:29:14.229 --> 01:29:14.239 align:start position:0%
kumandala for the record i'm a resident
 
01:29:16.629 --> 01:29:16.639 align:start position:0%
of bedford new hampshire and uh i'm just
 
01:29:18.390 --> 01:29:18.400 align:start position:0%
gonna reel it back in i'm gonna keep it
 
01:29:19.669 --> 01:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
really short
 
01:29:19.679 --> 01:29:21.189 align:start position:0%
really short
um

01:29:21.189 --> 01:29:21.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:23.270 --> 01:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
so i just wanna express my concern about
 
01:29:25.629 --> 01:29:25.639 align:start position:0%
the wording of the amendment to
 
01:29:28.629 --> 01:29:28.639 align:start position:0%
hb220 the language currently states that
 
01:29:30.629 --> 01:29:30.639 align:start position:0%
no person may be compelled to receive an
 
01:29:33.270 --> 01:29:33.280 align:start position:0%
immunization for covet 19 in order to
 
01:29:35.350 --> 01:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
secure receive or access any public
 
01:29:35.360 --> 01:29:36.709 align:start position:0%
secure receive or access any public
facility

01:29:36.709 --> 01:29:36.719 align:start position:0%
facility
 
01:29:39.270 --> 01:29:39.280 align:start position:0%
my question is what about a vaccine for
 
01:29:42.470 --> 01:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
covid 20 covid 21.
 
01:29:44.229 --> 01:29:44.239 align:start position:0%
the media is constantly reminding us and
 
01:29:46.709 --> 01:29:46.719 align:start position:0%
warning us about variants and
 
01:29:48.790 --> 01:29:48.800 align:start position:0%
they'll this will surely lead to more
 
01:29:51.430 --> 01:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
boosters and new vaccines
 
01:29:53.990 --> 01:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
and i'm also concerned that you know
 
01:29:55.590 --> 01:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
based on
 
01:29:57.830 --> 01:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
the warnings of the experts
 
01:29:59.910 --> 01:29:59.920 align:start position:0%
that on a long enough timeline
 
01:30:02.470 --> 01:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
nobody is going to be fully vaccinated
 
01:30:05.430 --> 01:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
because the cdc and the who reserve the
 
01:30:07.990 --> 01:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
right to update their definition of
 
01:30:10.310 --> 01:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
fully vaccinated
 
01:30:12.870 --> 01:30:12.880 align:start position:0%
so it's it's my wish to express my
 
01:30:14.790 --> 01:30:14.800 align:start position:0%
concern that we need to take a hard line
 
01:30:17.430 --> 01:30:17.440 align:start position:0%
now against any and all coerced medical
 
01:30:21.510 --> 01:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
procedures uh covet 19 flu
 
01:30:23.830 --> 01:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
anything we just we need to uphold the
 
01:30:26.070 --> 01:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
right of bodily autonomy my body my
 
01:30:26.080 --> 01:30:26.950 align:start position:0%
right of bodily autonomy my body my
choice

01:30:26.950 --> 01:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
choice
 
01:30:28.629 --> 01:30:28.639 align:start position:0%
that needs to be inscribed as the law of
 
01:30:29.750 --> 01:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
the land
 
01:30:33.030 --> 01:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
and that's got to be fundamental
 
01:30:35.830 --> 01:30:35.840 align:start position:0%
this human right also um in
 
01:30:37.750 --> 01:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
regards to this bill i don't think this
 
01:30:39.669 --> 01:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
bill goes far enough um in protecting
 
01:30:42.229 --> 01:30:42.239 align:start position:0%
the most vulnerable of society i.e the
 
01:30:44.550 --> 01:30:44.560 align:start position:0%
children the elderly the incarcerated
 
01:30:47.030 --> 01:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
the mentally ill
 
01:30:49.590 --> 01:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
human beings uh are sacred they have
 
01:30:51.590 --> 01:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
inaudible lights endowed by their
 
01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:52.550 align:start position:0%
inaudible lights endowed by their
creator

01:30:52.550 --> 01:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
creator
 
01:30:54.310 --> 01:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
uh as for me personally i have no king
 
01:30:55.510 --> 01:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
but jesus
 
01:30:58.229 --> 01:30:58.239 align:start position:0%
um and i think that this bill is a good
 
01:31:00.629 --> 01:31:00.639 align:start position:0%
start but in many ways does not go far
 
01:31:03.110 --> 01:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
enough in upholding our fundamental
 
01:31:05.430 --> 01:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
inalienable human rights
 
01:31:06.709 --> 01:31:06.719 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:31:07.990 --> 01:31:08.000 align:start position:0%

i stand here before you as an educated
 
01:32:11.750 --> 01:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
medical person who has been vaccinated
 
01:32:13.910 --> 01:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
over thirty times
 
01:32:15.430 --> 01:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
i am also a parent who has an
 
01:32:16.790 --> 01:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
eighteen-year-old son and he's been
 
01:32:18.870 --> 01:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
vaccinated every
 
01:32:21.750 --> 01:32:21.760 align:start position:0%

so please when i speak before you today
 
01:32:26.390 --> 01:32:26.400 align:start position:0%
do not think for one minute to label me
 
01:32:29.189 --> 01:32:29.199 align:start position:0%
as an anti-vaxxer misinformed or a
 
01:32:31.189 --> 01:32:31.199 align:start position:0%
conspiracy theorist
 
01:32:34.390 --> 01:32:34.400 align:start position:0%
because i have none of those attributes
 
01:32:36.470 --> 01:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
thirty years ago the idea of global
 
01:32:38.709 --> 01:32:38.719 align:start position:0%
tyranny under the premise of a global
 
01:32:41.350 --> 01:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
economic system was revealed to me by an
 
01:32:43.750 --> 01:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
author named gary carr
 
01:32:45.430 --> 01:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
he wrote a book entitled enroute to
 
01:32:47.030 --> 01:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
global occupation
 
01:32:49.189 --> 01:32:49.199 align:start position:0%
and in an attempt to it was his attempt
 
01:32:51.110 --> 01:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
to warn the world about this plan that
 
01:32:53.590 --> 01:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
was in process
 
01:32:55.350 --> 01:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
and since that time i've witnessed this
 
01:32:57.350 --> 01:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
plan unfold
 
01:32:58.790 --> 01:32:58.800 align:start position:0%
hence when the president of the united
 
01:33:00.470 --> 01:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
states declared the country was going to
 
01:33:03.350 --> 01:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
be locked down along with the rest of
 
01:33:04.709 --> 01:33:04.719 align:start position:0%
the world
 
01:33:07.990 --> 01:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
due to a novel virus i felt mentally and
 
01:33:09.430 --> 01:33:09.440 align:start position:0%
spiritually prepared for what was
 
01:33:09.440 --> 01:33:12.870 align:start position:0%
spiritually prepared for what was
unfolding

01:33:12.870 --> 01:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:15.189 --> 01:33:15.199 align:start position:0%
as we stand here today and we deliberate
 
01:33:17.990 --> 01:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
the policy of medical interventions i
 
01:33:20.470 --> 01:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
politely ask you to please just stop all
 
01:33:23.110 --> 01:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
the rhetoric we need to start calling
 
01:33:25.270 --> 01:33:25.280 align:start position:0%
out this pandemic for what it is
 
01:33:27.189 --> 01:33:27.199 align:start position:0%
our terrorist attack on the global
 
01:33:27.199 --> 01:33:28.629 align:start position:0%

to protect us
 
01:33:38.950 --> 01:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
this attack has been followed by an
 
01:33:41.669 --> 01:33:41.679 align:start position:0%
incessant propaganda campaign of
 
01:33:44.629 --> 01:33:44.639 align:start position:0%

to vaccinate or not to vaccinate
 
01:33:55.910 --> 01:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
this is also an attempt to move the
 
01:33:58.229 --> 01:33:58.239 align:start position:0%
united states population from exercising
 
01:34:00.629 --> 01:34:00.639 align:start position:0%
their constitutional freedoms as
 
01:34:02.950 --> 01:34:02.960 align:start position:0%

our rights and liberties
 
01:34:09.350 --> 01:34:09.360 align:start position:0%
selling us the idea that the needs of
 
01:34:11.669 --> 01:34:11.679 align:start position:0%
the many outweigh the needs of the few

of concern for our health and well-being
 
01:34:19.830 --> 01:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
but it is a move to uh it is rather to
 
01:34:22.870 --> 01:34:22.880 align:start position:0%
move our society into corporate fascism
 
01:34:25.590 --> 01:34:25.600 align:start position:0%
which in turn permits our politicians to
 
01:34:27.430 --> 01:34:27.440 align:start position:0%
move forward with their build back
 
01:34:29.590 --> 01:34:29.600 align:start position:0%

it's the green new deal
 
01:34:45.189 --> 01:34:45.199 align:start position:0%
and they're using all the covert relief
 
01:34:48.629 --> 01:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
funding to put in this infrastructure
 
01:34:50.390 --> 01:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
the real issue any of us should be
 
01:34:52.390 --> 01:34:52.400 align:start position:0%

this technocratic tyranny than succumb
 
01:35:55.030 --> 01:35:55.040 align:start position:0%

01:39:53.590 --> 01:39:53.600 align:start position:0%
to reverse the direction
 
01:39:55.910 --> 01:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
that seems to be overwhelming us right
 
01:39:55.920 --> 01:39:57.830 align:start position:0%
that seems to be overwhelming us right
now

01:39:57.830 --> 01:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:40:01.109 --> 01:40:01.119 align:start position:0%
i have a grandson who is a very gifted
 
01:40:03.669 --> 01:40:03.679 align:start position:0%
and talented physical therapist
 
01:40:05.750 --> 01:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
who has had to choose
 
01:40:07.590 --> 01:40:07.600 align:start position:0%
to either get
 
01:40:08.390 --> 01:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
this is
 
01:40:11.109 --> 01:40:11.119 align:start position:0%
this morning printed from the virus
 
01:40:13.910 --> 01:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
we asked for documentation
 
01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:15.189 align:start position:0%
we asked for documentation
site

01:40:15.189 --> 01:40:15.199 align:start position:0%
site
 
01:40:17.910 --> 01:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
he had to choose between taking all of
 
01:40:20.629 --> 01:40:20.639 align:start position:0%
these risks into his body and into his
 
01:40:20.639 --> 01:40:22.629 align:start position:0%
these risks into his body and into his
life

01:40:22.629 --> 01:40:22.639 align:start position:0%
life
 
01:40:22.639 --> 01:40:23.990 align:start position:0%
life
or

01:40:23.990 --> 01:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:40:27.109 --> 01:40:27.119 align:start position:0%
lose his ability to
 
01:40:29.590 --> 01:40:29.600 align:start position:0%
support his family
 
01:40:32.070 --> 01:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
i believe he's wisely chosen
 
01:40:36.310 --> 01:40:36.320 align:start position:0%
to not do this to himself
 
01:40:39.350 --> 01:40:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:42.310 --> 01:40:42.320 align:start position:0%
as things stand right now he will not be
 
01:40:44.229 --> 01:40:44.239 align:start position:0%
able to return
 
01:40:46.310 --> 01:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
to what he's gifted and talented for
 
01:40:48.310 --> 01:40:48.320 align:start position:0%
which was the care
 
01:40:53.270 --> 01:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:55.270 --> 01:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
i have another friend here in new
 
01:40:58.470 --> 01:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire who works from
 
01:40:58.480 --> 01:41:00.070 align:start position:0%
hampshire who works from
home

01:41:00.070 --> 01:41:00.080 align:start position:0%
home
 
01:41:02.070 --> 01:41:02.080 align:start position:0%
for a company
 
01:41:04.629 --> 01:41:04.639 align:start position:0%
that is requiring everyone to be
 
01:41:04.639 --> 01:41:06.229 align:start position:0%
that is requiring everyone to be
universally

01:41:06.229 --> 01:41:06.239 align:start position:0%
universally
 
01:41:08.310 --> 01:41:08.320 align:start position:0%
vaccinated with all of these
 
01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:10.310 align:start position:0%
vaccinated with all of these
ramifications

01:41:10.310 --> 01:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
ramifications
 
01:41:15.590 --> 01:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:18.390 --> 01:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
none of this makes sense
 
01:41:22.070 --> 01:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
none of us serves the purpose
 
01:41:24.870 --> 01:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
i am an old lady
 
01:41:26.790 --> 01:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
i need
 
01:41:26.800 --> 01:41:28.550 align:start position:0%
i need
medical

01:41:28.550 --> 01:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
medical
 
01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:29.910 align:start position:0%
medical
facilities

01:41:29.910 --> 01:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
01:41:33.510 --> 01:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
that i can go to when my body breaks
 
01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:34.950 align:start position:0%
that i can go to when my body breaks
down

01:41:34.950 --> 01:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
down
 
01:41:37.590 --> 01:41:37.600 align:start position:0%
i sleep at night because i have people
 
01:41:39.830 --> 01:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
out there who protect me and have always
 
01:41:42.790 --> 01:41:42.800 align:start position:0%
protected me and my family
 
01:41:45.750 --> 01:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
the fire the police
 
01:41:48.149 --> 01:41:48.159 align:start position:0%
communities that have taken care of each
 
01:41:48.159 --> 01:41:49.030 align:start position:0%
communities that have taken care of each
other

01:41:49.030 --> 01:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:41:53.430 --> 01:41:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:57.830 --> 01:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
if this is not stopped now
 
01:42:04.390 --> 01:42:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:06.629 --> 01:42:06.639 align:start position:0%
we will not have life-sustaining
 
01:42:09.350 --> 01:42:09.360 align:start position:0%
services that we rely on
 
01:42:11.350 --> 01:42:11.360 align:start position:0%
our children
 
01:42:14.709 --> 01:42:14.719 align:start position:0%
will be damaged by this give them the
 
01:42:14.719 --> 01:42:16.070 align:start position:0%
will be damaged by this give them the
vaccine

01:42:16.070 --> 01:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
01:42:19.109 --> 01:42:19.119 align:start position:0%
and then we'll see what happens
 
01:42:19.119 --> 01:42:20.229 align:start position:0%
and then we'll see what happens
what

01:42:20.229 --> 01:42:20.239 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:42:22.629 --> 01:42:22.639 align:start position:0%
does that mean
 
01:42:25.109 --> 01:42:25.119 align:start position:0%
what does that mean
 
01:42:27.350 --> 01:42:27.360 align:start position:0%
that all of our children can be just
 
01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:28.550 align:start position:0%
that all of our children can be just
random

01:42:28.550 --> 01:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
random
 
01:42:31.350 --> 01:42:31.360 align:start position:0%

i beg you for the benefit of my family
 
01:42:39.270 --> 01:42:39.280 align:start position:0%

because you may never be given this
 
01:42:44.149 --> 01:42:44.159 align:start position:0%
chance to do it again if you don't do it
 
01:42:46.390 --> 01:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
now for us
 
01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:51.910 align:start position:0%
now for us

like when people do not follow their
 
01:43:03.510 --> 01:43:03.520 align:start position:0%

thank you for to be assembled and the
 
01:43:52.550 --> 01:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
committee for giving this time to speak
 
01:43:55.350 --> 01:43:55.360 align:start position:0%
um by now you've heard all the data
 
01:43:56.629 --> 01:43:56.639 align:start position:0%
that's held in contention by
 
01:43:58.629 --> 01:43:58.639 align:start position:0%
contemporary media and
 
01:44:00.870 --> 01:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
attempts to enforce consensus
 
01:44:02.790 --> 01:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
on this topic
 
01:44:02.800 --> 01:44:03.830 align:start position:0%
on this topic
and

01:44:03.830 --> 01:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:44:05.590 --> 01:44:05.600 align:start position:0%
i could go into
 
01:44:07.510 --> 01:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
well by not saying i'm going to go and
 
01:44:09.109 --> 01:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
do a little bit mass mandates are an
 
01:44:10.790 --> 01:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
interesting point here because that was
 
01:44:12.310 --> 01:44:12.320 align:start position:0%
kind of the opening of the just speaking
 
01:44:13.430 --> 01:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
to the mic and we're having a hard time
 
01:44:14.709 --> 01:44:14.719 align:start position:0%
there you go
 
01:44:16.229 --> 01:44:16.239 align:start position:0%
it's almost like the opening of a foot
 
01:44:18.870 --> 01:44:18.880 align:start position:0%
in the door with the mass mandates was
 
01:44:21.910 --> 01:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
this idea that it's completely false so
 
01:44:23.669 --> 01:44:23.679 align:start position:0%
they don't protect you no they don't
 
01:44:26.229 --> 01:44:26.239 align:start position:0%
protect you there's data that's gone out
 
01:44:28.390 --> 01:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
explaining how they collect contaminants
 
01:44:30.229 --> 01:44:30.239 align:start position:0%
in the membrane of the mask thereby
 
01:44:32.070 --> 01:44:32.080 align:start position:0%
contributing to oral infection and lung
 
01:44:32.080 --> 01:44:33.910 align:start position:0%
contributing to oral infection and lung
infections

01:44:33.910 --> 01:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
infections
 
01:44:36.149 --> 01:44:36.159 align:start position:0%
now going from that
 
01:44:38.550 --> 01:44:38.560 align:start position:0%
we have the whole thing kicked in the
 
01:44:40.470 --> 01:44:40.480 align:start position:0%
door in the face saying the alternative
 
01:44:43.109 --> 01:44:43.119 align:start position:0%
to mass is vaccination well
 
01:44:45.990 --> 01:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
let's go to what the core issue that is
 
01:44:48.950 --> 01:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
is human sovereignty and saying that
 
01:44:52.310 --> 01:44:52.320 align:start position:0%
your body as it stands is inadequate
 
01:44:53.669 --> 01:44:53.679 align:start position:0%
without some form of medical
 
01:44:56.149 --> 01:44:56.159 align:start position:0%
intervention that is a policy that we've
 
01:44:58.470 --> 01:44:58.480 align:start position:0%
had in this nation since birth subjected
 
01:44:59.990 --> 01:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
to young males in the form of infant
 
01:45:02.709 --> 01:45:02.719 align:start position:0%
angelic mutilation known as circumcision
 
01:45:04.070 --> 01:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
sorry to say
 
01:45:04.080 --> 01:45:05.350 align:start position:0%
sorry to say
now

01:45:05.350 --> 01:45:05.360 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:45:07.830 --> 01:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
we see that then being a
 
01:45:10.790 --> 01:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
kind of underground kind of
 
01:45:13.350 --> 01:45:13.360 align:start position:0%
gestalt in our society well that again
 
01:45:15.830 --> 01:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
is saying that the body as it stands is
 
01:45:17.189 --> 01:45:17.199 align:start position:0%
not adequate
 
01:45:20.709 --> 01:45:20.719 align:start position:0%
as it is created and produced
 
01:45:23.990 --> 01:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
we are or biological organisms we shed
 
01:45:27.510 --> 01:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
skin cells we have hair drop out we have
 
01:45:29.189 --> 01:45:29.199 align:start position:0%
you know boogers and snot and all that
 
01:45:32.390 --> 01:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
kind of stuff we're a little grime
 
01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:34.149 align:start position:0%
kind of stuff we're a little grime
there's

01:45:34.149 --> 01:45:34.159 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:45:36.149 --> 01:45:36.159 align:start position:0%
a fear of that
 
01:45:37.990 --> 01:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
written in the human paradigm that has a
 
01:45:40.390 --> 01:45:40.400 align:start position:0%
sensical aspect but against it's
 
01:45:43.430 --> 01:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
nonsense too and we get the nonsensical
 
01:45:45.189 --> 01:45:45.199 align:start position:0%
side of it you get something that
 
01:45:48.149 --> 01:45:48.159 align:start position:0%
becomes servile and very vindictive
 
01:45:50.070 --> 01:45:50.080 align:start position:0%
because it's afraid of itself it's
 
01:45:52.709 --> 01:45:52.719 align:start position:0%
afraid of human nature it does not want
 
01:45:54.229 --> 01:45:54.239 align:start position:0%
people to be walking around breathing
 
01:45:56.229 --> 01:45:56.239 align:start position:0%
freely because it's scared of what that
 
01:45:58.390 --> 01:45:58.400 align:start position:0%
other person might not just breathe out
 
01:45:59.910 --> 01:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
but what might come through the person's
 
01:46:02.709 --> 01:46:02.719 align:start position:0%
energy and their breath when they speak
 
01:46:04.070 --> 01:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
if we go to just want to go to
 
01:46:06.310 --> 01:46:06.320 align:start position:0%
historical context on this i actually
 
01:46:08.229 --> 01:46:08.239 align:start position:0%
find myself going back to the back
 
01:46:09.910 --> 01:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
looking into the black plague that hit
 
01:46:09.920 --> 01:46:10.870 align:start position:0%
looking into the black plague that hit
europe

01:46:10.870 --> 01:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
europe
 
01:46:12.870 --> 01:46:12.880 align:start position:0%
this was said to be a respiratory tract
 
01:46:15.189 --> 01:46:15.199 align:start position:0%
infection in both cases
 
01:46:17.590 --> 01:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
but in the case of
 
01:46:19.830 --> 01:46:19.840 align:start position:0%
the after effects of the vaccine and the
 
01:46:21.510 --> 01:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
strange phenomena that was called the
 
01:46:23.350 --> 01:46:23.360 align:start position:0%
saint vista stance during that time
 
01:46:25.430 --> 01:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
period people were having definite
 
01:46:27.350 --> 01:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
neurological conditions and symptoms and
 
01:46:30.950 --> 01:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
reactions to what was said to be covered
 
01:46:33.189 --> 01:46:33.199 align:start position:0%
if you look at the symptoms of covid
 
01:46:35.430 --> 01:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
they overlap
 
01:46:37.910 --> 01:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
with co2 poisoning with oxygen
 
01:46:40.950 --> 01:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
deprivation and neurological conditions
 
01:46:42.229 --> 01:46:42.239 align:start position:0%
that would be bought eventually be
 
01:46:44.470 --> 01:46:44.480 align:start position:0%
brought about by this vaccine
 
01:46:46.470 --> 01:46:46.480 align:start position:0%
it is a daunting
 
01:46:48.550 --> 01:46:48.560 align:start position:0%
endeavor to be able to look at this
 
01:46:51.590 --> 01:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
unbiased and understand how deeply this
 
01:46:53.030 --> 01:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
was planned out
 
01:46:55.189 --> 01:46:55.199 align:start position:0%
but it's something that we have to face
 
01:46:56.950 --> 01:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
and i come back again to the term
 
01:46:59.270 --> 01:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
survival to be servile that
 
01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:00.709 align:start position:0%
survival to be servile that
vindictiveness

01:47:00.709 --> 01:47:00.719 align:start position:0%
vindictiveness
 
01:47:04.550 --> 01:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
it's that fear but also kind of perverse
 
01:47:07.510 --> 01:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
need to bring everyone down to your
 
01:47:09.990 --> 01:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
level to say that this person you know
 
01:47:11.669 --> 01:47:11.679 align:start position:0%
threatens me by their
 
01:47:13.910 --> 01:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
being more aware or being more empowered
 
01:47:15.750 --> 01:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
in themselves and therefore i want to
 
01:47:17.109 --> 01:47:17.119 align:start position:0%
take them down a pet because i don't
 
01:47:19.590 --> 01:47:19.600 align:start position:0%
feel that in myself
 
01:47:22.550 --> 01:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
that i believe is the core aspect of
 
01:47:24.709 --> 01:47:24.719 align:start position:0%
this that we are facing as a nation and
 
01:47:26.709 --> 01:47:26.719 align:start position:0%
something that's coming out
 
01:47:29.189 --> 01:47:29.199 align:start position:0%
as we are inevitably obligated to
 
01:47:31.990 --> 01:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
consider these factors and how
 
01:47:33.430 --> 01:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
your fear
 
01:47:36.629 --> 01:47:36.639 align:start position:0%
does not ultimately enable you or should
 
01:47:39.189 --> 01:47:39.199 align:start position:0%
not enable you to dictate to other
 
01:47:39.199 --> 01:47:40.149 align:start position:0%
not enable you to dictate to other
people

01:47:40.149 --> 01:47:40.159 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:47:41.910 --> 01:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
how they live their lives how they
 
01:47:43.510 --> 01:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
express themselves how they have free
 
01:47:43.520 --> 01:47:44.950 align:start position:0%
express themselves how they have free
enterprise

01:47:44.950 --> 01:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
enterprise
 
01:47:47.669 --> 01:47:47.679 align:start position:0%
what you see as being wrong about them
 
01:47:50.870 --> 01:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
without concretely examining or deciding
 
01:47:52.950 --> 01:47:52.960 align:start position:0%
if it really is correct or not for the
 
01:47:54.629 --> 01:47:54.639 align:start position:0%
body politic
 
01:47:56.149 --> 01:47:56.159 align:start position:0%
these are all factors that were being
 
01:47:59.510 --> 01:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
made to face yet again
 
01:48:00.870 --> 01:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
in a kind of
 
01:48:04.470 --> 01:48:04.480 align:start position:0%
very much a boiling over almost
 
01:48:05.669 --> 01:48:05.679 align:start position:0%
of these factors that have been
 
01:48:08.470 --> 01:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
simmering in our cultural gestalts and
 
01:48:08.480 --> 01:48:09.590 align:start position:0%
simmering in our cultural gestalts and
our

01:48:09.590 --> 01:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:48:09.600 --> 01:48:10.790 align:start position:0%
our
existence

01:48:10.790 --> 01:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
existence
 
01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:11.669 align:start position:0%
existence
as

01:48:11.669 --> 01:48:11.679 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:48:11.679 --> 01:48:13.590 align:start position:0%
as
humanity

01:48:13.590 --> 01:48:13.600 align:start position:0%
humanity
 
01:48:15.270 --> 01:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
and now comes the time when we have to
 
01:48:15.280 --> 01:48:16.550 align:start position:0%
and now comes the time when we have to
decide

01:48:16.550 --> 01:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
decide
 
01:48:17.910 --> 01:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
the path we're going to follow to
 
01:48:19.590 --> 01:48:19.600 align:start position:0%
promote which is really helpful which
 
01:48:22.149 --> 01:48:22.159 align:start position:0%
really helps and sustains human life
 
01:48:24.310 --> 01:48:24.320 align:start position:0%
versus that servile aspect that will
 
01:48:27.189 --> 01:48:27.199 align:start position:0%
comply with tyranny and say
 
01:48:29.510 --> 01:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
basically you know as long as you're
 
01:48:31.910 --> 01:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
as long as i have my standing i don't
 
01:48:33.830 --> 01:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
care how far it makes other people fall
 
01:48:35.430 --> 01:48:35.440 align:start position:0%
i don't care if other people get pulled
 
01:48:37.990 --> 01:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
down by it because
 
01:48:39.669 --> 01:48:39.679 align:start position:0%
because of being told again and again
 
01:48:41.189 --> 01:48:41.199 align:start position:0%
that people are inadequate that we're
 
01:48:41.199 --> 01:48:42.229 align:start position:0%
that people are inadequate that we're
flawed

01:48:42.229 --> 01:48:42.239 align:start position:0%
flawed
 
01:48:45.750 --> 01:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
that that means that everyone else
 
01:48:47.109 --> 01:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
has to be
 
01:48:50.149 --> 01:48:50.159 align:start position:0%
you know in a state of duress of being
 
01:48:53.109 --> 01:48:53.119 align:start position:0%
you know feeling comfortable that
 
01:48:53.119 --> 01:48:56.310 align:start position:0%
you know feeling comfortable that
it's

01:48:56.310 --> 01:48:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:58.629 --> 01:48:58.639 align:start position:0%
to try and explain for well i can't i
 
01:49:00.149 --> 01:49:00.159 align:start position:0%
can't explain much further than that
 
01:49:01.510 --> 01:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
really with what i'm trying to
 
01:49:03.990 --> 01:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
articulate by those points
 
01:49:05.910 --> 01:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
i'm sure if the committee and those here
 
01:49:07.910 --> 01:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
speaking on behalf
 
01:49:09.350 --> 01:49:09.360 align:start position:0%
of sovereignty
 
01:49:11.270 --> 01:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
are you know seeing that too but you
 
01:49:12.550 --> 01:49:12.560 align:start position:0%
know everyone
 
01:49:14.070 --> 01:49:14.080 align:start position:0%
they're going can speak on it and bring
 
01:49:17.589 --> 01:49:17.599 align:start position:0%
some clarity to it counts
 
01:49:19.350 --> 01:49:19.360 align:start position:0%
thank you corey is there any questions
 
01:49:21.830 --> 01:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
corey was it yes corey for any questions
 
01:49:24.070 --> 01:49:24.080 align:start position:0%

01:49:25.270 --> 01:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
01:49:26.870 --> 01:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
testimony today sir very much appreciate
 
01:49:33.669 --> 01:49:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:36.229 --> 01:49:36.239 align:start position:0%
catherine mendola
 
01:49:38.790 --> 01:49:38.800 align:start position:0%
i think i asked for her before
 
01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:39.830 align:start position:0%
i think i asked for her before
nope

01:49:39.830 --> 01:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
nope
 
01:49:42.870 --> 01:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
we have three more speakers or
 
01:49:44.709 --> 01:49:44.719 align:start position:0%
unless we find catherine and we have
 
01:49:44.719 --> 01:49:45.669 align:start position:0%
unless we find catherine and we have
four

01:49:45.669 --> 01:49:45.679 align:start position:0%
four
 
01:49:55.750 --> 01:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:57.270 --> 01:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
so just give everyone an update while
 
01:49:58.870 --> 01:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
she's coming up to the microphone the
 
01:50:01.189 --> 01:50:01.199 align:start position:0%
goal is we have three speakers left
 
01:50:03.910 --> 01:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
counting paula um we'll take a a brief
 
01:50:05.669 --> 01:50:05.679 align:start position:0%
recess and we'll reconvene in a
 
01:50:08.229 --> 01:50:08.239 align:start position:0%
different room um and the committee will
 
01:50:10.149 --> 01:50:10.159 align:start position:0%
start doing some of its work on what the
 
01:50:16.790 --> 01:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:22.790 --> 01:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:25.350 --> 01:50:25.360 align:start position:0%
all right go ahead paul i apologize
 
01:50:27.109 --> 01:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
that's okay good morning
 
01:50:28.470 --> 01:50:28.480 align:start position:0%
i'm members of the committee and thank
 
01:50:30.070 --> 01:50:30.080 align:start position:0%
you for allowing me to come here again
 
01:50:31.430 --> 01:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
today to speak
 
01:50:33.109 --> 01:50:33.119 align:start position:0%
monday was in better shape than i am
 
01:50:34.709 --> 01:50:34.719 align:start position:0%
today because i am a person with a
 
01:50:36.629 --> 01:50:36.639 align:start position:0%
disability although i don't look like i
 
01:50:39.189 --> 01:50:39.199 align:start position:0%
have a disability i do
 
01:50:40.870 --> 01:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
and i'll tell you something i'm getting
 
01:50:42.709 --> 01:50:42.719 align:start position:0%
sick and tired of being discriminated
 
01:50:45.109 --> 01:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
against out there and even at my board
 
01:50:48.310 --> 01:50:48.320 align:start position:0%
meetings because i am elected too
 
01:50:50.310 --> 01:50:50.320 align:start position:0%
this thing with the mask has gone way
 
01:50:51.589 --> 01:50:51.599 align:start position:0%
too far
 
01:50:53.350 --> 01:50:53.360 align:start position:0%
way too far because if you have a
 
01:50:55.830 --> 01:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
disability you can't breathe with it it
 
01:50:57.589 --> 01:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter you're discriminated
 
01:50:59.750 --> 01:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
against and on monday i said i will be
 
01:51:01.830 --> 01:51:01.840 align:start position:0%
losing my job tomorrow because i cannot
 
01:51:04.070 --> 01:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
wear a mask because i cannot breathe
 
01:51:05.109 --> 01:51:05.119 align:start position:0%
with it
 
01:51:07.030 --> 01:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
and it is really a shame what's going on
 
01:51:08.390 --> 01:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
in this state
 
01:51:10.149 --> 01:51:10.159 align:start position:0%
i didn't come prepare to write anything
 
01:51:12.470 --> 01:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
because i came in very quickly because
 
01:51:14.870 --> 01:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
my body does not allow me to walk move
 
01:51:17.589 --> 01:51:17.599 align:start position:0%
fast that's at times and so today i'm
 
01:51:19.910 --> 01:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
standing here in excruciating pain and
 
01:51:22.390 --> 01:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
the thought of being vaccinated i think
 
01:51:24.790 --> 01:51:24.800 align:start position:0%
would kill me because of my autoimmune
 
01:51:27.189 --> 01:51:27.199 align:start position:0%
because of fibromyalgia oh that's right
 
01:51:28.709 --> 01:51:28.719 align:start position:0%
people don't know that much about
 
01:51:31.189 --> 01:51:31.199 align:start position:0%
fibromyalgia this is a very debilitating
 
01:51:33.189 --> 01:51:33.199 align:start position:0%
disease it affects the nerves and the
 
01:51:34.950 --> 01:51:34.960 align:start position:0%
muscles and i don't talk about it very
 
01:51:37.270 --> 01:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
much because i try to go on with my life
 
01:51:39.830 --> 01:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
as normal for 29 years from a severe
 
01:51:42.550 --> 01:51:42.560 align:start position:0%
auto accident that i had
 
01:51:44.709 --> 01:51:44.719 align:start position:0%
and i got up this morning's the first
 
01:51:47.189 --> 01:51:47.199 align:start position:0%
time that i've gotten up and felt beaten
 
01:51:49.910 --> 01:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
up by the board i sat on last night
 
01:51:51.910 --> 01:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
going after me again because i cannot
 
01:51:54.310 --> 01:51:54.320 align:start position:0%
wear masks trying to help people with a
 
01:51:56.790 --> 01:51:56.800 align:start position:0%
disability to make
 
01:52:00.470 --> 01:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
accessible access for them
 
01:52:02.550 --> 01:52:02.560 align:start position:0%
and you know and i look at around here
 
01:52:05.109 --> 01:52:05.119 align:start position:0%
and these children that i that were up
 
01:52:07.430 --> 01:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
here that came in with masks
 
01:52:09.430 --> 01:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
masks so
 
01:52:11.589 --> 01:52:11.599 align:start position:0%
i did some a little bit of work here
 
01:52:13.189 --> 01:52:13.199 align:start position:0%
thank god for these phones i guess i
 
01:52:15.030 --> 01:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
hate it because they track you every
 
01:52:16.550 --> 01:52:16.560 align:start position:0%
place you go
 
01:52:19.270 --> 01:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
um you know and i'm looking at
 
01:52:22.709 --> 01:52:22.719 align:start position:0%
some things here cdc
 
01:52:22.719 --> 01:52:23.669 align:start position:0%
some things here cdc
okay

01:52:23.669 --> 01:52:23.679 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:52:26.950 --> 01:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
who owns a cdc big farmer owns the cdc
 
01:52:28.709 --> 01:52:28.719 align:start position:0%
so that's why they tell us what to do
 
01:52:31.030 --> 01:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
that we have to take the vaccines make
 
01:52:33.510 --> 01:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
no mistakes they do
 
01:52:33.520 --> 01:52:34.550 align:start position:0%
no mistakes they do
um

01:52:34.550 --> 01:52:34.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:37.350 --> 01:52:37.360 align:start position:0%
i'm going through some cdc gets millions
 
01:52:40.709 --> 01:52:40.719 align:start position:0%
of dollars annually from big pharma
 
01:52:42.229 --> 01:52:42.239 align:start position:0%
of course
 
01:52:43.750 --> 01:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
that's why they all want us to have the
 
01:52:43.760 --> 01:52:45.030 align:start position:0%
that's why they all want us to have the
vaccines

01:52:45.030 --> 01:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
vaccines
 
01:52:47.910 --> 01:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
oh and fda who do they get their funding
 
01:52:50.629 --> 01:52:50.639 align:start position:0%
from now fda's funding has increasingly
 
01:52:53.510 --> 01:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
come from industries that it regulates
 
01:52:56.149 --> 01:52:56.159 align:start position:0%
my mother used to say if fda approves it
 
01:52:57.589 --> 01:52:57.599 align:start position:0%
don't take it they're going to kill you
 
01:52:59.430 --> 01:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
she was absolutely right even with this
 
01:53:02.310 --> 01:53:02.320 align:start position:0%
emergency youth authorization
 
01:53:05.109 --> 01:53:05.119 align:start position:0%
and i said on monday i sat in this
 
01:53:08.390 --> 01:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
chamber here my seat was 5-17
 
01:53:10.070 --> 01:53:10.080 align:start position:0%
and i didn't realize that that was my
 
01:53:12.310 --> 01:53:12.320 align:start position:0%
mother's birthday and she passed away in
 
01:53:14.870 --> 01:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
march after i got sworn in but she gave
 
01:53:17.270 --> 01:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
me the courage to sit here and he didn't
 
01:53:19.750 --> 01:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
vote party lines i voted what i thought
 
01:53:21.270 --> 01:53:21.280 align:start position:0%
was best for the state and my
 
01:53:23.510 --> 01:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
constituents in nashua
 
01:53:26.550 --> 01:53:26.560 align:start position:0%
because the people elected me like they
 
01:53:28.550 --> 01:53:28.560 align:start position:0%
have done in nashua again
 
01:53:30.470 --> 01:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
to do the best that i have to do to
 
01:53:33.510 --> 01:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
protect them and the kids
 
01:53:36.310 --> 01:53:36.320 align:start position:0%
but why i came flying up here again this
 
01:53:38.149 --> 01:53:38.159 align:start position:0%
morning late
 
01:53:40.790 --> 01:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
because i couldn't move this morning and
 
01:53:42.149 --> 01:53:42.159 align:start position:0%
a friend of mine called me and i was
 
01:53:43.910 --> 01:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
crying on the phone nobody ever sees me
 
01:53:45.669 --> 01:53:45.679 align:start position:0%
crying because i have to be strong for
 
01:53:47.189 --> 01:53:47.199 align:start position:0%
my constituents
 
01:53:49.589 --> 01:53:49.599 align:start position:0%
i'm tired of getting beaten up everybody
 
01:53:51.350 --> 01:53:51.360 align:start position:0%
who's sitting here is tired of getting
 
01:53:53.109 --> 01:53:53.119 align:start position:0%
beaten up that we should have to come
 
01:53:55.750 --> 01:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
here and beg our elected officials to do
 
01:53:58.229 --> 01:53:58.239 align:start position:0%
what they have to do is right
 
01:53:58.239 --> 01:53:59.030 align:start position:0%
what they have to do is right
then

01:53:59.030 --> 01:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:54:02.149 --> 01:54:02.159 align:start position:0%
we took i talked about in the
 
01:54:04.149 --> 01:54:04.159 align:start position:0%
spring of last year the mass that the
 
01:54:06.629 --> 01:54:06.639 align:start position:0%
parents in florida
 
01:54:10.470 --> 01:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
that sent out to get tested
 
01:54:11.990 --> 01:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
and you know what came back in those
 
01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:13.990 align:start position:0%
and you know what came back in those
masks

01:54:13.990 --> 01:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
masks
 
01:54:16.390 --> 01:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
legionnaires disease from the bacteria
 
01:54:18.470 --> 01:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
streptococcus wait a second that's
 
01:54:20.709 --> 01:54:20.719 align:start position:0%
that's worse than the backs
 
01:54:23.270 --> 01:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
than the vaccine in certain extents
 
01:54:26.310 --> 01:54:26.320 align:start position:0%
well let me back up that's worse
 
01:54:28.470 --> 01:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
than covert
 
01:54:30.709 --> 01:54:30.719 align:start position:0%
because children don't get covert and if
 
01:54:33.430 --> 01:54:33.440 align:start position:0%
they do it's very minimal
 
01:54:35.189 --> 01:54:35.199 align:start position:0%
their survival rate is better than
 
01:54:36.790 --> 01:54:36.800 align:start position:0%
anybody else but then again you know
 
01:54:38.950 --> 01:54:38.960 align:start position:0%
let's talk about cuomo put elderly
 
01:54:40.790 --> 01:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
patients who were sick in a nursing home
 
01:54:42.070 --> 01:54:42.080 align:start position:0%
and killed them that was
 
01:54:45.030 --> 01:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
the whole thing to kill off the elderly
 
01:54:46.550 --> 01:54:46.560 align:start position:0%
so then
 
01:54:49.350 --> 01:54:49.360 align:start position:0%
we have what else do we have in here
 
01:54:51.669 --> 01:54:51.679 align:start position:0%
i hit my page
 
01:54:53.109 --> 01:54:53.119 align:start position:0%
and i'm not going to be shut down and
 
01:54:55.510 --> 01:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
speaking from what i'm going to say you
 
01:54:58.070 --> 01:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
get pneumonia tuberculosis tuberculosis
 
01:54:59.750 --> 01:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
is worse than covet
 
01:55:02.470 --> 01:55:02.480 align:start position:0%
meningitis is worse than covet
 
01:55:04.709 --> 01:55:04.719 align:start position:0%
and the list goes on and on and on
 
01:55:08.310 --> 01:55:08.320 align:start position:0%
parasites fungi dangerous pathogens
 
01:55:10.550 --> 01:55:10.560 align:start position:0%
cloth the paper masks they're coming
 
01:55:14.070 --> 01:55:14.080 align:start position:0%
back with they're having carcinogens
 
01:55:14.950 --> 01:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
in it
 
01:55:17.669 --> 01:55:17.679 align:start position:0%
masks preliminary lab analysis found
 
01:55:20.149 --> 01:55:20.159 align:start position:0%
toxic chemicals in these paper masks and
 
01:55:23.189 --> 01:55:23.199 align:start position:0%
some masks these include known allergens
 
01:55:25.109 --> 01:55:25.119 align:start position:0%
and carcinogens as well as control
 
01:55:27.350 --> 01:55:27.360 align:start position:0%
substance mass intent to be used by the
 
01:55:30.550 --> 01:55:30.560 align:start position:0%
general public are not deemed to be ppe
 
01:55:32.550 --> 01:55:32.560 align:start position:0%
therefore they do not have to meet the
 
01:55:34.870 --> 01:55:34.880 align:start position:0%
standards by mass sworn by doctors
 
01:55:36.390 --> 01:55:36.400 align:start position:0%
eighty percent eighty-five percent of
 
01:55:39.669 --> 01:55:39.679 align:start position:0%
all mass made worldwide come from china
 
01:55:41.750 --> 01:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
china that's where the
 
01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:44.080 align:start position:0%
covet came from china
 
01:55:46.629 --> 01:55:46.639 align:start position:0%
and concerns have been raised over
 
01:55:48.950 --> 01:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
substandard and manufacturing
 
01:55:50.470 --> 01:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
supply chains
 
01:55:52.390 --> 01:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
so we're putting these on our face and
 
01:55:52.400 --> 01:55:53.430 align:start position:0%
so we're putting these on our face and
even

01:55:53.430 --> 01:55:53.440 align:start position:0%
even
 
01:55:55.350 --> 01:55:55.360 align:start position:0%
the kids have said toxic because i
 
01:55:56.870 --> 01:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
brought it to my meeting
 
01:55:59.189 --> 01:55:59.199 align:start position:0%
so what i want to say here i guess maybe
 
01:56:00.790 --> 01:56:00.800 align:start position:0%
in closing
 
01:56:02.790 --> 01:56:02.800 align:start position:0%
i'm going to read a list here and i'm
 
01:56:04.950 --> 01:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
not going to be stopped
 
01:56:06.950 --> 01:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh are these as long as it's not getting
 
01:56:09.109 --> 01:56:09.119 align:start position:0%
into personal attacks please go ahead
 
01:56:11.030 --> 01:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
you know what it's not it's just a list
 
01:56:12.709 --> 01:56:12.719 align:start position:0%
of it's not a personal attack this is
 
01:56:14.950 --> 01:56:14.960 align:start position:0%
public it's just a list of all our state
 
01:56:16.790 --> 01:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
senators who took money
 
01:56:20.310 --> 01:56:20.320 align:start position:0%
from um fisa and i think it has to be
 
01:56:23.830 --> 01:56:23.840 align:start position:0%
known that where
 
01:56:25.910 --> 01:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
this is about policy and not about
 
01:56:29.830 --> 01:56:29.840 align:start position:0%
people you know what i i'm allowed
 
01:56:31.669 --> 01:56:31.679 align:start position:0%
you can't stop the public from doing
 
01:56:34.629 --> 01:56:34.639 align:start position:0%
this because i think people need to know
 
01:56:37.270 --> 01:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
because of the fact that we have to come
 
01:56:39.990 --> 01:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
here this is my second time here
 
01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:40.830 align:start position:0%

people want to look it up they can look
 
01:57:35.750 --> 01:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
to the campaign finance system
 
01:57:36.709 --> 01:57:36.719 align:start position:0%
it is
 
01:57:38.950 --> 01:57:38.960 align:start position:0%
but we're not going for public attack
 
01:57:40.709 --> 01:57:40.719 align:start position:0%
going for personal
 
01:57:43.189 --> 01:57:43.199 align:start position:0%
sorry we're not going for the personal
 
01:57:45.830 --> 01:57:45.840 align:start position:0%

but i'll tell you thank you very much
 
01:57:49.510 --> 01:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
because now the people are starting to
 
01:57:52.390 --> 01:57:52.400 align:start position:0%
see here who's taking the money
 
01:57:54.870 --> 01:57:54.880 align:start position:0%
and why we the people
 
01:57:56.550 --> 01:57:56.560 align:start position:0%
have to come here
 
01:57:58.470 --> 01:57:58.480 align:start position:0%
and fight for our rights and these are
 
01:58:00.310 --> 01:58:00.320 align:start position:0%
our forefathers who gave us our
 
01:58:02.470 --> 01:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
god-living rights and given us our
 
01:58:05.270 --> 01:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
rights to be here no citizen in this
 
01:58:07.189 --> 01:58:07.199 align:start position:0%
state should have to fight live free or
 
01:58:09.510 --> 01:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
die and if you want to take the money
 
01:58:12.070 --> 01:58:12.080 align:start position:0%

01:58:55.109 --> 01:58:55.119 align:start position:0%
and pediatric nursing was
 
01:58:56.629 --> 01:58:56.639 align:start position:0%
my heart and soul
 
01:58:59.510 --> 01:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
so i am here to talk
 
01:59:01.430 --> 01:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
about different
 
01:59:05.830 --> 01:59:05.840 align:start position:0%
different avenues of the um
 
01:59:07.750 --> 01:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
so-called um
 
01:59:09.910 --> 01:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
gene therapy
 
01:59:11.750 --> 01:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
which is its real name it's not a
 
01:59:14.550 --> 01:59:14.560 align:start position:0%
vaccine they just put a vaccine name on
 
01:59:18.950 --> 01:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:21.910 --> 01:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
we've never seen
 
01:59:24.390 --> 01:59:24.400 align:start position:0%
this level of side effects for any
 
01:59:27.830 --> 01:59:27.840 align:start position:0%
vaccine gene therapy injection without
 
01:59:30.470 --> 01:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
the fda taken action
 
01:59:34.550 --> 01:59:34.560 align:start position:0%
the rotovirus vaccine was canceled
 
01:59:38.390 --> 01:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
was canceled for 15 cases of non-lethal
 
01:59:41.589 --> 01:59:41.599 align:start position:0%
side effects and the swine flu vaccine
 
01:59:44.790 --> 01:59:44.800 align:start position:0%
was canceled for 25 deaths
 
01:59:48.629 --> 01:59:48.639 align:start position:0%
but now by the cdc's own data we are
 
01:59:51.270 --> 01:59:51.280 align:start position:0%
seeing a 1200
 
01:59:52.629 --> 01:59:52.639 align:start position:0%
12 000
 
01:59:54.790 --> 01:59:54.800 align:start position:0%
increase in deaths
 
01:59:56.870 --> 01:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
with these vaccines and they are
 
01:59:59.910 --> 01:59:59.920 align:start position:0%
promoting this to our kids
 
02:00:02.709 --> 02:00:02.719 align:start position:0%
children's ace receptors are not
 
02:00:05.350 --> 02:00:05.360 align:start position:0%
prominent therefore they are not getting
 
02:00:05.360 --> 02:00:06.790 align:start position:0%
prominent therefore they are not getting
covered

02:00:06.790 --> 02:00:06.800 align:start position:0%
covered
 
02:00:07.990 --> 02:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
as much
 
02:00:11.270 --> 02:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
pediatrician dr larry palowski
 
02:00:14.310 --> 02:00:14.320 align:start position:0%
state ace receptors and children do not
 
02:00:16.870 --> 02:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
connect well
 
02:00:19.189 --> 02:00:19.199 align:start position:0%
now um with your permission
 
02:00:20.550 --> 02:00:20.560 align:start position:0%
i forgot to say good morning to
 
02:00:22.950 --> 02:00:22.960 align:start position:0%

also get

this affects children a lot
 
02:02:15.910 --> 02:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
as a reference to all these side effects
 
02:02:18.470 --> 02:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
in meredith we have i know three people
 
02:02:20.550 --> 02:02:20.560 align:start position:0%
who've had a bad reaction
 
02:02:22.709 --> 02:02:22.719 align:start position:0%
from the visa
 
02:02:25.430 --> 02:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
one is a friend of mine who got a
 
02:02:25.440 --> 02:02:26.790 align:start position:0%
one is a friend of mine who got a
microclot

02:02:26.790 --> 02:02:26.800 align:start position:0%
microclot
 
02:02:29.430 --> 02:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
in his eye in a small vessel and is now
 
02:02:29.440 --> 02:02:31.270 align:start position:0%
in his eye in a small vessel and is now
blind

02:02:31.270 --> 02:02:31.280 align:start position:0%
blind
 
02:02:32.390 --> 02:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
the other two
 
02:02:32.400 --> 02:02:33.430 align:start position:0%
the other two
um

02:02:33.430 --> 02:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:35.030 --> 02:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
had um
 
02:02:37.669 --> 02:02:37.679 align:start position:0%
chickenpox virus and i'm sure there's
 
02:02:39.990 --> 02:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
much more in merit that have been
 
02:02:42.390 --> 02:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
affected but i don't know of them but
 
02:02:44.950 --> 02:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
i'm probably sure
 
02:02:49.350 --> 02:02:49.360 align:start position:0%
um i just read that the cdd cdc is
 
02:02:51.669 --> 02:02:51.679 align:start position:0%
putting in a blood center in
 
02:02:53.990 --> 02:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
five to six year old kids so that they
 
02:02:56.550 --> 02:02:56.560 align:start position:0%
can get vaccinated
 
02:02:59.270 --> 02:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
and what do they think will be be the
 
02:03:01.669 --> 02:03:01.679 align:start position:0%
side effect bleeding if it's not
 
02:03:06.310 --> 02:03:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:08.870 --> 02:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
gene therapy i don't like to call it a
 
02:03:10.629 --> 02:03:10.639 align:start position:0%
vaccine because it really isn't a
 
02:03:10.639 --> 02:03:12.310 align:start position:0%
vaccine because it really isn't a
vaccine

02:03:12.310 --> 02:03:12.320 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
02:03:15.030 --> 02:03:15.040 align:start position:0%
why would the cdc give young children a
 
02:03:16.629 --> 02:03:16.639 align:start position:0%
blood thinner
 
02:03:18.950 --> 02:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
why in heaven's name would they do this
 
02:03:20.870 --> 02:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
to our children
 
02:03:23.589 --> 02:03:23.599 align:start position:0%
this is a red flag
 
02:03:25.589 --> 02:03:25.599 align:start position:0%
for all parents
 
02:03:27.750 --> 02:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
and teenagers who have already had the
 
02:03:30.390 --> 02:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
shot and had these problems such as
 
02:03:30.400 --> 02:03:32.470 align:start position:0%
shot and had these problems such as
pericarditis

02:03:32.470 --> 02:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
pericarditis
 
02:03:32.480 --> 02:03:33.669 align:start position:0%
pericarditis
and

02:03:33.669 --> 02:03:33.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:03:36.390 --> 02:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
all heart diseases you know they what's
 
02:03:38.550 --> 02:03:38.560 align:start position:0%
happening i don't understand it why are
 
02:03:41.270 --> 02:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
they doing this to our children
 
02:03:43.510 --> 02:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
um the dose has been decreased for
 
02:03:43.520 --> 02:03:44.629 align:start position:0%
um the dose has been decreased for
children

02:03:44.629 --> 02:03:44.639 align:start position:0%
children
 
02:03:47.270 --> 02:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
why wasn't it for the the
 
02:03:49.910 --> 02:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
the decrease for the teens
 
02:03:51.350 --> 02:03:51.360 align:start position:0%
why not
 
02:03:52.870 --> 02:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
and for the young
 
02:03:55.589 --> 02:03:55.599 align:start position:0%
why wasn't it um
 
02:03:58.310 --> 02:03:58.320 align:start position:0%
oh i forgot to say pericarditis and well
 
02:03:58.320 --> 02:03:59.350 align:start position:0%
oh i forgot to say pericarditis and well
now

02:03:59.350 --> 02:03:59.360 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:04:02.229 --> 02:04:02.239 align:start position:0%
all these children and i read that um a
 
02:04:02.239 --> 02:04:03.430 align:start position:0%
all these children and i read that um a
five

02:04:03.430 --> 02:04:03.440 align:start position:0%
five
 
02:04:05.910 --> 02:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
and a six-year-old in indiana was
 
02:04:08.069 --> 02:04:08.079 align:start position:0%
mistakenly given
 
02:04:08.079 --> 02:04:09.189 align:start position:0%
mistakenly given
the

02:04:09.189 --> 02:04:09.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:04:12.310 --> 02:04:12.320 align:start position:0%
adult vaccine dose instead of the flu
 
02:04:12.320 --> 02:04:13.189 align:start position:0%
adult vaccine dose instead of the flu
shot

02:04:13.189 --> 02:04:13.199 align:start position:0%
shot
 
02:04:15.270 --> 02:04:15.280 align:start position:0%
both those children are cardiac
 
02:04:17.270 --> 02:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
compromised now
 
02:04:19.830 --> 02:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
and they're only three and five
 
02:04:22.229 --> 02:04:22.239 align:start position:0%
um so what's going to happen with these
 
02:04:24.950 --> 02:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
kids and these teens you know what is
 
02:04:26.310 --> 02:04:26.320 align:start position:0%
going to happen to them they're going to
 
02:04:28.470 --> 02:04:28.480 align:start position:0%
be they're going to be
 
02:04:30.390 --> 02:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
a cardiac individ
 
02:04:33.109 --> 02:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
invalid for the rest of their lives
 
02:04:35.910 --> 02:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
these crimes are against humanity i
 
02:04:39.109 --> 02:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
really don't understand
 
02:04:40.790 --> 02:04:40.800 align:start position:0%
that at all
 
02:04:44.390 --> 02:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
why the cdc can even give us and tell us
 
02:04:47.350 --> 02:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
what to do they're not the government
 
02:04:49.589 --> 02:04:49.599 align:start position:0%
um i want to read something else what
 
02:04:52.470 --> 02:04:52.480 align:start position:0%
they're doing with the infants the
 
02:04:55.109 --> 02:04:55.119 align:start position:0%
national institute of health
 
02:04:57.189 --> 02:04:57.199 align:start position:0%
approved a 3 million grant to the
 
02:05:00.629 --> 02:05:00.639 align:start position:0%
university of pittsburgh for inducing
 
02:05:00.639 --> 02:05:01.750 align:start position:0%
university of pittsburgh for inducing
labor

02:05:01.750 --> 02:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
labor
 
02:05:04.550 --> 02:05:04.560 align:start position:0%
on full-term pregnant women
 
02:05:07.350 --> 02:05:07.360 align:start position:0%
and then removed organs from the fetuses
 
02:05:11.350 --> 02:05:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:13.669 --> 02:05:13.679 align:start position:0%
the truth is always more bizarre than
 
02:05:16.229 --> 02:05:16.239 align:start position:0%
fiction this and according to the
 
02:05:18.229 --> 02:05:18.239 align:start position:0%
medical records obtained
 
02:05:20.550 --> 02:05:20.560 align:start position:0%
the university of pittsburgh medical
 
02:05:22.229 --> 02:05:22.239 align:start position:0%
search team
 
02:05:24.629 --> 02:05:24.639 align:start position:0%
will would take full
 
02:05:28.229 --> 02:05:28.239 align:start position:0%
term pregnant women and induce them only
 
02:05:33.109 --> 02:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
to then take their baby organs for sale
 
02:05:35.910 --> 02:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
studies show that the university
 
02:05:39.030 --> 02:05:39.040 align:start position:0%
would take unborn babies from six weeks
 
02:05:42.709 --> 02:05:42.719 align:start position:0%
to 42 weeks remove their organs and then
 
02:05:45.109 --> 02:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
proceed to place the organs in the
 
02:05:46.950 --> 02:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
school's tissue bank
 
02:05:48.950 --> 02:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
where they would
 
02:05:51.270 --> 02:05:51.280 align:start position:0%
put them in the vaccines or whatever
 
02:05:54.709 --> 02:05:54.719 align:start position:0%
they want to do is it's disgraceful
 
02:05:57.189 --> 02:05:57.199 align:start position:0%
these universities are disgraceful i
 
02:05:59.990 --> 02:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
have a couple of other things
 
02:06:01.430 --> 02:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
but i think they've been mentioned
 
02:06:01.440 --> 02:06:06.470 align:start position:0%
but i think they've been mentioned
already

02:06:06.470 --> 02:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:06.480 --> 02:06:07.830 align:start position:0%
 
menticide

02:06:07.830 --> 02:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
menticide
 
02:06:10.069 --> 02:06:10.079 align:start position:0%
means the killing of the mind
 
02:06:13.430 --> 02:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
priming society begins with fear using
 
02:06:15.910 --> 02:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
waves of terror which is propaganda
 
02:06:18.149 --> 02:06:18.159 align:start position:0%
which promotes confusion and helps to
 
02:06:20.790 --> 02:06:20.800 align:start position:0%
break down the mind the big lie is
 
02:06:20.800 --> 02:06:22.629 align:start position:0%
break down the mind the big lie is
emotional

02:06:22.629 --> 02:06:22.639 align:start position:0%
emotional
 
02:06:25.350 --> 02:06:25.360 align:start position:0%
use they use contradictory reports to
 
02:06:29.669 --> 02:06:29.679 align:start position:0%
confuse which descends into total terror
 
02:06:32.149 --> 02:06:32.159 align:start position:0%
tele i'm having trouble with that word
 
02:06:33.709 --> 02:06:33.719 align:start position:0%
total terror
 
02:06:36.870 --> 02:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
totalitarian so um i thank you for your
 
02:06:36.880 --> 02:06:38.069 align:start position:0%
totalitarian so um i thank you for your
time

02:06:38.069 --> 02:06:38.079 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:06:41.510 --> 02:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
and um hopefully you will put i know
 
02:06:44.709 --> 02:06:44.719 align:start position:0%
you've got a lot of laws already
 
02:06:46.870 --> 02:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
you know ready to set and discuss but i
 
02:06:46.880 --> 02:06:47.910 align:start position:0%
you know ready to set and discuss but i
hope

02:06:47.910 --> 02:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
hope
 
02:06:51.109 --> 02:06:51.119 align:start position:0%
in my heart and soul and that you will
 
02:06:53.589 --> 02:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
take the right step and
 
02:06:57.189 --> 02:06:57.199 align:start position:0%
do more with the bill about the vaccine
 
02:06:58.709 --> 02:06:58.719 align:start position:0%
in the first place
 
02:07:00.870 --> 02:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
because it is very
 
02:07:01.910 --> 02:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
02:07:04.390 --> 02:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
all pertinent to what's happening so i
 
02:07:06.390 --> 02:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:07:07.910 --> 02:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
thank you rosemary any questions for
 
02:07:13.510 --> 02:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:14.950 --> 02:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
would you be willing to uh take a
 
02:07:14.960 --> 02:07:16.790 align:start position:0%
would you be willing to uh take a
question

02:07:16.790 --> 02:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:07:18.550 --> 02:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
uh representative elaine go ahead um
 
02:07:19.750 --> 02:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for
 
02:07:21.669 --> 02:07:21.679 align:start position:0%
i'm good thank you for bringing
 
02:07:24.069 --> 02:07:24.079 align:start position:0%
attention to the recent fda approval of
 
02:07:26.470 --> 02:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
pradaxa which is a novel anticoagulant
 
02:07:27.669 --> 02:07:27.679 align:start position:0%
for children
 
02:07:29.510 --> 02:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
are you aware that that's actually for
 
02:07:31.430 --> 02:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
kids that have mechanical heart valves
 
02:07:32.870 --> 02:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
and other things that otherwise are on
 
02:07:32.880 --> 02:07:34.550 align:start position:0%
and other things that otherwise are on
warfarin

02:07:34.550 --> 02:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
warfarin
 
02:07:36.470 --> 02:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
i know it's i know it seems sinister but
 
02:07:38.069 --> 02:07:38.079 align:start position:0%
there's a good medical use no i think
 
02:07:40.149 --> 02:07:40.159 align:start position:0%
there are children that are on it who
 
02:07:41.669 --> 02:07:41.679 align:start position:0%
are compromised
 
02:07:44.629 --> 02:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
because i worked in pediatrics in boston
 
02:07:46.149 --> 02:07:46.159 align:start position:0%
in my training
 
02:07:48.629 --> 02:07:48.639 align:start position:0%
and um but they are going to give it
 
02:07:51.270 --> 02:07:51.280 align:start position:0%
giving it to healthy kids that's the
 
02:07:51.280 --> 02:07:52.709 align:start position:0%
giving it to healthy kids that's the
problem

02:07:52.709 --> 02:07:52.719 align:start position:0%
problem
 
02:07:54.310 --> 02:07:54.320 align:start position:0%
i don't see any of that in the approval
 
02:07:57.510 --> 02:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
but thank you oh i do have that um
 
02:07:59.270 --> 02:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
i can send you stuff
 
02:08:01.510 --> 02:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:08:02.709 --> 02:08:02.719 align:start position:0%
all right so a couple more speakers
 
02:08:05.030 --> 02:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
again if we can keep the testimony to
 
02:08:06.790 --> 02:08:06.800 align:start position:0%
under 10 minutes preferably around five
 
02:08:08.790 --> 02:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
that would be really appreciated um
 
02:08:11.030 --> 02:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
patricia myers
 
02:08:15.109 --> 02:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:18.550 --> 02:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:20.310 --> 02:08:20.320 align:start position:0%
i spoke monday again lift that
 
02:08:21.669 --> 02:08:21.679 align:start position:0%
microphone up so it's pointing straight
 
02:08:24.069 --> 02:08:24.079 align:start position:0%
at your mouth there you go sorry i was
 
02:08:26.149 --> 02:08:26.159 align:start position:0%
here monday i wasn't particularly
 
02:08:28.790 --> 02:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
articulate but a couple of things i want
 
02:08:32.149 --> 02:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
to get out of the way first um
 
02:08:34.550 --> 02:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
i don't i take exception to be referred
 
02:08:38.069 --> 02:08:38.079 align:start position:0%
to as anti-vaxx i am not anti-vaxx
 
02:08:39.990 --> 02:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
i've had more vaccinations than most of
 
02:08:41.430 --> 02:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
you in this room unless you were in the
 
02:08:41.440 --> 02:08:42.950 align:start position:0%
you in this room unless you were in the
military

02:08:42.950 --> 02:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
military
 
02:08:42.960 --> 02:08:44.390 align:start position:0%
military
um

02:08:44.390 --> 02:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:45.430 --> 02:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
i am
 
02:08:45.440 --> 02:08:47.510 align:start position:0%
i am
pro-health

02:08:47.510 --> 02:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
pro-health
 
02:08:57.910 --> 02:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:00.550 --> 02:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
as far as the controversy against
 
02:09:00.560 --> 02:09:02.229 align:start position:0%
as far as the controversy against
vaccinations

02:09:02.229 --> 02:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
vaccinations
 
02:09:05.830 --> 02:09:05.840 align:start position:0%
do you remember the anthrax vaccine
 
02:09:08.470 --> 02:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
that came out in the 80s and 90s
 
02:09:10.229 --> 02:09:10.239 align:start position:0%
my husband was in the military and he
 
02:09:12.229 --> 02:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
had that
 
02:09:14.310 --> 02:09:14.320 align:start position:0%
and he had complications in the military
 
02:09:16.390 --> 02:09:16.400 align:start position:0%
you do not tell them i am not taking a
 
02:09:18.629 --> 02:09:18.639 align:start position:0%
vaccine they will discharge you
 
02:09:18.639 --> 02:09:22.470 align:start position:0%
vaccine they will discharge you
dishonorably

02:09:22.470 --> 02:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:24.149 --> 02:09:24.159 align:start position:0%
and the other issue as far as
 
02:09:26.069 --> 02:09:26.079 align:start position:0%
information on these things there is a
 
02:09:26.079 --> 02:09:27.229 align:start position:0%
information on these things there is a
website

02:09:27.229 --> 02:09:27.239 align:start position:0%
website
 
02:09:29.109 --> 02:09:29.119 align:start position:0%
frontlinedoctors.com they have a very
 
02:09:29.119 --> 02:09:31.030 align:start position:0%
frontlinedoctors.com they have a very
comprehensive

02:09:31.030 --> 02:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
comprehensive
 
02:09:31.040 --> 02:09:34.149 align:start position:0%
comprehensive
um

02:09:34.149 --> 02:09:34.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:36.069 --> 02:09:36.079 align:start position:0%
informational site
 
02:09:39.510 --> 02:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
the other one is um you can look up
 
02:09:39.520 --> 02:09:40.870 align:start position:0%
the other one is um you can look up
vanderbosh

02:09:40.870 --> 02:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
vanderbosh
 
02:09:42.709 --> 02:09:42.719 align:start position:0%
he is one of the developers of the
 
02:09:42.719 --> 02:09:44.390 align:start position:0%
he is one of the developers of the
vaccine

02:09:44.390 --> 02:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
02:09:46.790 --> 02:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
and he is one of the people who are
 
02:09:48.629 --> 02:09:48.639 align:start position:0%
telling us not to take it
 
02:09:51.910 --> 02:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
he knows what's in it he made it
 
02:09:51.920 --> 02:09:53.430 align:start position:0%
he knows what's in it he made it
okay

02:09:53.430 --> 02:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:09:54.790 --> 02:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
the crux of my
 
02:09:56.870 --> 02:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh testimony this morning is that this
 
02:09:59.510 --> 02:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
is not the issue
 
02:10:02.470 --> 02:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
covid anything associated with it is not
 
02:10:07.350 --> 02:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:09.270 --> 02:10:09.280 align:start position:0%
you have several bills pending about
 
02:10:11.750 --> 02:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
covid why do we need so many bills
 
02:10:13.510 --> 02:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
in my opinion there are way too many
 
02:10:17.270 --> 02:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
bills on the books they should be burned
 
02:10:20.069 --> 02:10:20.079 align:start position:0%
they're expensive to bring forward
 
02:10:23.910 --> 02:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:27.430 --> 02:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
end up what they were intended to do
 
02:10:30.390 --> 02:10:30.400 align:start position:0%
you heard testimony about the um
 
02:10:32.390 --> 02:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
the language saying only covet is
 
02:10:34.390 --> 02:10:34.400 align:start position:0%
protect uh people
 
02:10:35.990 --> 02:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
you should change the language to all
 
02:10:38.229 --> 02:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
medical procedures not just covet that's
 
02:10:39.830 --> 02:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
one of the things that happens with our
 
02:10:41.830 --> 02:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
laws i know i read them and i'm very
 
02:10:46.870 --> 02:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:48.470 --> 02:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
my premise is that we should go back to
 
02:10:49.830 --> 02:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
the original laws
 
02:10:51.430 --> 02:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
the constitution
 
02:10:55.350 --> 02:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:57.830 --> 02:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
the biblical laws which are even higher
 
02:10:59.830 --> 02:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
love god with all your heart mind soul
 
02:11:01.830 --> 02:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
and might then you won't be
 
02:11:01.840 --> 02:11:03.830 align:start position:0%
and might then you won't be
as

02:11:03.830 --> 02:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
as
 
02:11:06.870 --> 02:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
inclined perhaps to
 
02:11:06.880 --> 02:11:09.030 align:start position:0%
inclined perhaps to
cave

02:11:09.030 --> 02:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
cave
 
02:11:10.390 --> 02:11:10.400 align:start position:0%
the next one love your neighbor as
 
02:11:10.400 --> 02:11:11.910 align:start position:0%
the next one love your neighbor as
yourself

02:11:11.910 --> 02:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
yourself
 
02:11:13.990 --> 02:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
and i understand some of us may not love
 
02:11:16.310 --> 02:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
ourselves very well so that might hinder
 
02:11:18.229 --> 02:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
how we love others but to make it
 
02:11:19.830 --> 02:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
clearer do unto others as you would have
 
02:11:22.390 --> 02:11:22.400 align:start position:0%
them do unto you
 
02:11:27.510 --> 02:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:31.270 --> 02:11:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:32.790 --> 02:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
that's supposed to be a warm fuzzy thing
 
02:11:36.550 --> 02:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:38.069 --> 02:11:38.079 align:start position:0%
and chased out those who defiled his
 
02:11:39.350 --> 02:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
father's house
 
02:11:41.270 --> 02:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
and made no mistake
 
02:11:45.510 --> 02:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:45.520 --> 02:11:46.790 align:start position:0%
 
anyway

02:11:46.790 --> 02:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
02:11:46.800 --> 02:11:47.750 align:start position:0%
anyway
the

02:11:47.750 --> 02:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:11:49.589 --> 02:11:49.599 align:start position:0%
legislature of this state is supposed to
 
02:11:51.270 --> 02:11:51.280 align:start position:0%
protect the interests of the people that
 
02:11:53.270 --> 02:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
it serves
 
02:11:54.870 --> 02:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
and i will say right now that there are
 
02:11:58.149 --> 02:11:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:02.629 --> 02:12:02.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:03.910 --> 02:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
our state
 
02:12:05.669 --> 02:12:05.679 align:start position:0%
is not obliged to bow down to the
 
02:12:07.750 --> 02:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
federal government that is why we make
 
02:12:09.430 --> 02:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
laws to stop the encroachment of that
 
02:12:09.440 --> 02:12:15.510 align:start position:0%
laws to stop the encroachment of that
government

02:12:15.510 --> 02:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:17.830 --> 02:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
the issue is
 
02:12:20.229 --> 02:12:20.239 align:start position:0%
the corruption the broken system that's
 
02:12:21.830 --> 02:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
what the issue is
 
02:12:25.270 --> 02:12:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:27.270 --> 02:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
and then voting
 
02:12:28.790 --> 02:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
on issues that affect the people who
 
02:12:30.709 --> 02:12:30.719 align:start position:0%
gave this the money
 
02:12:32.229 --> 02:12:32.239 align:start position:0%
the issue is
 
02:12:33.510 --> 02:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
an executive
 
02:12:33.520 --> 02:12:34.390 align:start position:0%
an executive
chief

02:12:34.390 --> 02:12:34.400 align:start position:0%
chief
 
02:12:36.229 --> 02:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
who puts his police force to an open
 
02:12:38.069 --> 02:12:38.079 align:start position:0%
shame by having people arrested for
 
02:12:39.430 --> 02:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
nothing more
 
02:12:41.350 --> 02:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
than that they were too enthusiastic in
 
02:12:43.109 --> 02:12:43.119 align:start position:0%
their recitation of the pledge of
 
02:12:43.119 --> 02:12:46.790 align:start position:0%
their recitation of the pledge of
allegiance

02:12:46.790 --> 02:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:49.430 --> 02:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
right now the way i see it
 
02:12:50.950 --> 02:12:50.960 align:start position:0%
this state
 
02:12:52.950 --> 02:12:52.960 align:start position:0%
has been in the process of being sold to
 
02:12:54.870 --> 02:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
the highest bidder
 
02:12:57.189 --> 02:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
it is time for that to stop
 
02:12:59.350 --> 02:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
it is your job to enforce the checks and
 
02:13:01.350 --> 02:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
balances that the founders put in place
 
02:13:03.270 --> 02:13:03.280 align:start position:0%
to ensure that these assaults
 
02:13:07.430 --> 02:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:09.189 --> 02:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:13:12.470 --> 02:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:14.550 --> 02:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
so apparently we have another group of
 
02:13:16.390 --> 02:13:16.400 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming students
 
02:13:18.390 --> 02:13:18.400 align:start position:0%
that's coming to the state house from uh
 
02:13:20.149 --> 02:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
virginia where where we have people from
 
02:13:20.159 --> 02:13:26.629 align:start position:0%
virginia where where we have people from
today

02:13:26.629 --> 02:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:28.229 --> 02:13:28.239 align:start position:0%

the policy of medical interventions and
 
02:13:35.830 --> 02:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
immunizations it was a study committee
 
02:13:38.629 --> 02:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
that came out of house bill 220 which
 
02:13:41.350 --> 02:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
was a bill that
 
02:13:43.589 --> 02:13:43.599 align:start position:0%
restricted government from creating
 
02:13:45.270 --> 02:13:45.280 align:start position:0%
certain side of coveted passports and
 
02:13:47.669 --> 02:13:47.679 align:start position:0%

this nation
 
02:15:05.510 --> 02:15:05.520 align:start position:0%

i
 
02:15:09.910 --> 02:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
have lived most of my life working in
 
02:15:12.870 --> 02:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
human services

i am also
 
02:15:17.510 --> 02:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
my other
 
02:15:19.270 --> 02:15:19.280 align:start position:0%
true self is
 
02:15:31.109 --> 02:15:31.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:39.350 --> 02:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:41.270 --> 02:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
i have a quote here
 
02:15:45.030 --> 02:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:46.550 --> 02:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
author of the first and only
 
02:15:49.430 --> 02:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed covid19 disease treatment
 
02:15:49.440 --> 02:15:51.030 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed covid19 disease treatment
protocol

02:15:51.030 --> 02:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
protocol
 
02:15:55.910 --> 02:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:59.589 --> 02:15:59.599 align:start position:0%
very much unlike dr fauci's
 
02:16:03.750 --> 02:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:07.189 --> 02:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
he says due to viral loads the vaccines
 
02:16:10.229 --> 02:16:10.239 align:start position:0%
do not provide any safety
 
02:16:11.910 --> 02:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
02:16:17.430 --> 02:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:17.440 --> 02:16:18.629 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:16:18.629 --> 02:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:16:20.390 --> 02:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
my aim here is to cut through some of
 
02:16:23.270 --> 02:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
the dead wood in the discussion
 
02:16:24.790 --> 02:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
although hundreds of thousands of
 
02:16:27.669 --> 02:16:27.679 align:start position:0%
americans are this fall lining up before
 
02:16:27.679 --> 02:16:29.030 align:start position:0%
americans are this fall lining up before
committees

02:16:29.030 --> 02:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
committees
 
02:16:30.709 --> 02:16:30.719 align:start position:0%
and school boards
 
02:16:33.830 --> 02:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
and exposing the coveted plandemic fraud
 
02:16:36.469 --> 02:16:36.479 align:start position:0%
and corruption a thousand times over
 
02:16:39.190 --> 02:16:39.200 align:start position:0%
the committees sit there in their seats
 
02:16:41.030 --> 02:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
and shuffle papers around
 
02:16:43.990 --> 02:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
then go home to their complacent non-fbi
 
02:16:47.429 --> 02:16:47.439 align:start position:0%
violated homes
 
02:16:50.790 --> 02:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
virtually nothing is being done by u.s
 
02:16:53.750 --> 02:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
state or local committees in response to
 
02:16:56.870 --> 02:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
the grievances about the covid fraud
 
02:16:59.349 --> 02:16:59.359 align:start position:0%
i hope that i'm understating that so
 
02:17:01.509 --> 02:17:01.519 align:start position:0%
sorry if i am you know
 
02:17:08.309 --> 02:17:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:10.070 --> 02:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
all this mirrors what's going on in
 
02:17:11.669 --> 02:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
other countries those countries were
 
02:17:13.270 --> 02:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
never really free
 
02:17:16.309 --> 02:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
but the us is acting just like them now
 
02:17:18.070 --> 02:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
there's no difference now except a bit
 
02:17:21.030 --> 02:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
of severity which we
 
02:17:23.990 --> 02:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
are still spared temporarily millions
 
02:17:25.830 --> 02:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
and millions of concerned citizens of
 
02:17:28.150 --> 02:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
other nations are rising up around the
 
02:17:30.230 --> 02:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
world and calling out the tyranny
 
02:17:31.990 --> 02:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
demanding that it end
 
02:17:35.270 --> 02:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
but there is zero responsiveness to the
 
02:17:37.669 --> 02:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
the people's movement around the world
 
02:17:39.910 --> 02:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
only crushing force in return by their
 
02:17:42.309 --> 02:17:42.319 align:start position:0%
governments the police with expressions
 
02:17:45.030 --> 02:17:45.040 align:start position:0%
of boredom complacency and cold power on
 
02:17:47.750 --> 02:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
their faces carry out the abominable
 
02:17:47.760 --> 02:17:48.790 align:start position:0%
their faces carry out the abominable
deeds

02:17:48.790 --> 02:17:48.800 align:start position:0%
deeds
 
02:17:51.349 --> 02:17:51.359 align:start position:0%
and support them
 
02:17:53.429 --> 02:17:53.439 align:start position:0%
just the same as in america in new
 
02:17:55.830 --> 02:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire you have whistleblower therese
 
02:17:58.070 --> 02:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
grinnell being arrested and charged with
 
02:18:00.870 --> 02:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
the crime of saying amen to the phrase
 
02:18:04.709 --> 02:18:04.719 align:start position:0%
under god in the pledge of allegiance
 
02:18:06.709 --> 02:18:06.719 align:start position:0%
or the crime of endeavoring to keep
 
02:18:09.030 --> 02:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
illegal meetings with illegal votes from
 
02:18:11.589 --> 02:18:11.599 align:start position:0%
happening can this kind of travesty of
 
02:18:15.910 --> 02:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
justice be tolerated not on my watch
 
02:18:18.309 --> 02:18:18.319 align:start position:0%
the attitude by officials employers
 
02:18:20.230 --> 02:18:20.240 align:start position:0%
anyone holding a position of relative
 
02:18:21.830 --> 02:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
power seems to be
 
02:18:23.830 --> 02:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
it's not our job to actually do
 
02:18:26.150 --> 02:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
something substantial about this it's
 
02:18:28.629 --> 02:18:28.639 align:start position:0%
not our department
 
02:18:30.870 --> 02:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
it's as if all of us were born in early
 
02:18:34.790 --> 02:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
20th century berlin or in bavaria
 
02:18:37.349 --> 02:18:37.359 align:start position:0%
in reality it is one's responsibility
 
02:18:39.589 --> 02:18:39.599 align:start position:0%
and is one's department when fraud and
 
02:18:41.589 --> 02:18:41.599 align:start position:0%
crime are being committed to act
 
02:18:43.910 --> 02:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
strongly or to do
 
02:18:46.070 --> 02:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
what the very least one can to call it
 
02:18:48.549 --> 02:18:48.559 align:start position:0%
out and to refrain from cooperating with
 
02:18:51.750 --> 02:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
it no matter what position one is in
 
02:18:53.910 --> 02:18:53.920 align:start position:0%

united states commits the prime of com
 
02:18:57.910 --> 02:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
crime of completely abandoning
 
02:19:00.230 --> 02:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
separation of powers by acting as a
 
02:19:02.950 --> 02:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
dictator handing down covet decrees
 
02:19:05.110 --> 02:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
while calling them rules
 
02:19:07.509 --> 02:19:07.519 align:start position:0%
how many people fully call this what it
 
02:19:10.150 --> 02:19:10.160 align:start position:0%
is the end of the u.s yes legal
 
02:19:10.160 --> 02:19:11.830 align:start position:0%
is the end of the u.s yes legal
objection

02:19:11.830 --> 02:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
objection

02:19:21.750 --> 02:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
legal objections are race but the
 
02:19:23.589 --> 02:19:23.599 align:start position:0%
administration is confident they will
 
02:19:25.110 --> 02:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
amount to nothing
 
02:19:27.429 --> 02:19:27.439 align:start position:0%
this is the end of the us unless we the
 
02:19:28.870 --> 02:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
people and you the members of this
 
02:19:31.750 --> 02:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
committee take strong action
 
02:19:34.070 --> 02:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
fraud and deception the media speaks in
 
02:19:35.750 --> 02:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
a single mouthpiece voice with the
 
02:19:37.910 --> 02:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
government declaring absurdly that a
 
02:19:39.509 --> 02:19:39.519 align:start position:0%
vaccine that should have been banned a
 
02:19:42.070 --> 02:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
hundred times over by now is safe and
 
02:19:44.549 --> 02:19:44.559 align:start position:0%
effective we have no media it is in the
 
02:19:47.110 --> 02:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
hands of mobsters the mainstream media
 
02:19:49.910 --> 02:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
accuses its victims of misinforming
 
02:19:52.389 --> 02:19:52.399 align:start position:0%
everyone which is in fact its own hard
 
02:19:53.910 --> 02:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
and fast rule
 
02:19:55.990 --> 02:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
airline pilots take the vacci
 
02:19:57.750 --> 02:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
vaccination and then when they get up to
 
02:19:59.590 --> 02:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
altitude in their plane they get tunnel
 
02:20:01.590 --> 02:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
vision and they barely get the plane
 
02:20:03.190 --> 02:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
down to the ground and can't remember
 
02:20:05.110 --> 02:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
how they did it the same thing happens
 
02:20:07.429 --> 02:20:07.439 align:start position:0%
to truck drivers one could go on and on
 
02:20:10.950 --> 02:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
but the real point is it's a weapon
 
02:20:13.270 --> 02:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
but the media tells us this is not
 
02:20:13.280 --> 02:20:14.469 align:start position:0%
but the media tells us this is not
happening

02:20:14.469 --> 02:20:14.479 align:start position:0%
happening
 
02:20:17.030 --> 02:20:17.040 align:start position:0%

pertinent his warning becomes today

robert kennedy jr has delved into some

of the history of the cia how it was

initially established as an espionage

organization tasked solely with
 
02:20:35.990 --> 02:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
intelligence gathering only to transform
 
02:20:38.389 --> 02:20:38.399 align:start position:0%
into a paramilitary agency engaged with

democratic activities
 
02:20:47.270 --> 02:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
this transformation is globalist

imperialist in nature

never ended mockingbird appropriately
 
02:20:58.710 --> 02:20:58.720 align:start position:0%

as edward curtin put it in an off
 
02:21:20.389 --> 02:21:20.399 align:start position:0%
guardian article
 
02:21:23.030 --> 02:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
for all practice practical purposes when
 
02:21:24.950 --> 02:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
it comes to matters that bear on
 
02:21:26.870 --> 02:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
important foreign and domestic matters

dr joseph
 
02:21:35.910 --> 02:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
mercola states in the past year even
 
02:21:38.550 --> 02:21:38.560 align:start position:0%
licensed licensed medical doctors and
 
02:21:41.510 --> 02:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
award-winning scientists have undergone
 
02:21:43.510 --> 02:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
the modern version of being tarred and
 
02:21:46.309 --> 02:21:46.319 align:start position:0%
feathered online followed by expulsion
 
02:21:48.309 --> 02:21:48.319 align:start position:0%
from their web-based communities for the
 
02:21:50.950 --> 02:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
crime of asking common sense questions
 
02:21:53.510 --> 02:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
and speaking truth to power
 
02:21:55.429 --> 02:21:55.439 align:start position:0%
jake this is this is not to mention
 
02:21:56.870 --> 02:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
being attacked
 
02:21:58.550 --> 02:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
by members of their own medical
 
02:22:01.030 --> 02:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
societies who wish to go along to get
 
02:22:01.040 --> 02:22:02.790 align:start position:0%
societies who wish to go along to get
along

02:22:02.790 --> 02:22:02.800 align:start position:0%
along
 
02:22:04.309 --> 02:22:04.319 align:start position:0%
jay so
 
02:22:05.270 --> 02:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
it sounds like you're reading your
 
02:22:07.030 --> 02:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
testimony and you have a written copy
 
02:22:08.150 --> 02:22:08.160 align:start position:0%
which we're happy to take for the
 
02:22:10.309 --> 02:22:10.319 align:start position:0%
committee but we're at a time for for
 
02:22:12.790 --> 02:22:12.800 align:start position:0%
again this is your second second speech
 
02:22:14.150 --> 02:22:14.160 align:start position:0%
well sir i
 
02:22:17.110 --> 02:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
i beg your consideration because
 
02:22:17.120 --> 02:22:19.110 align:start position:0%
i beg your consideration because
um

02:22:19.110 --> 02:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:21.110 --> 02:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:22:22.790 --> 02:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
another thing that's happening and has
 
02:22:24.230 --> 02:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
been happening for quite a number of
 
02:22:27.110 --> 02:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
years in these committee hearings
 
02:22:29.270 --> 02:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
is that the time people are given in
 
02:22:31.590 --> 02:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
which to express what they have to say
 
02:22:33.590 --> 02:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
is not adequate
 
02:22:35.429 --> 02:22:35.439 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:22:37.349 --> 02:22:37.359 align:start position:0%
and indeed uh
 
02:22:37.359 --> 02:22:38.389 align:start position:0%
and indeed uh
often

02:22:38.389 --> 02:22:38.399 align:start position:0%
often
 
02:22:40.230 --> 02:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
the people who want to speak don't even
 
02:22:42.150 --> 02:22:42.160 align:start position:0%
get to speak unfortunately that's not
 
02:22:45.590 --> 02:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
the case here so i i beg your indulgence
 
02:22:47.429 --> 02:22:47.439 align:start position:0%
a little further how much more time do
 
02:22:49.510 --> 02:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
you think you need
 
02:22:50.870 --> 02:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh just
 
02:22:53.190 --> 02:22:53.200 align:start position:0%
just about five more minutes
 
02:22:54.070 --> 02:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
02:22:54.080 --> 02:22:55.910 align:start position:0%
go ahead
okay

02:22:55.910 --> 02:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:22:58.710 --> 02:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
uh kurt edward curtin continues just the
 
02:23:00.389 --> 02:23:00.399 align:start position:0%
other day the new york times had this
 
02:23:01.429 --> 02:23:01.439 align:start position:0%
end line
 
02:23:04.150 --> 02:23:04.160 align:start position:0%
robert kennedy jr barred from instagram
 
02:23:07.190 --> 02:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
over false virus claims notice the lack
 
02:23:10.710 --> 02:23:10.720 align:start position:0%
of the word alleged before false
 
02:23:15.110 --> 02:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
virus claims in the new york times
 
02:23:17.510 --> 02:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
this is guilt by headline it is a
 
02:23:19.830 --> 02:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
perfect piece of propaganda posing as a
 
02:23:22.630 --> 02:23:22.640 align:start position:0%
reporting since it accuses kennedy a
 
02:23:25.349 --> 02:23:25.359 align:start position:0%
brilliant and honorable man
 
02:23:28.950 --> 02:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
of falsity and stupidity thus justifying
 
02:23:31.270 --> 02:23:31.280 align:start position:0%
in instagram's ban
 
02:23:33.990 --> 02:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
and it it is an inducement further
 
02:23:36.950 --> 02:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
censorship of mr kennedy by facebook
 
02:23:39.830 --> 02:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
instagram's parent company this is one
 
02:23:41.830 --> 02:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
example of the censorship underway with
 
02:23:44.469 --> 02:23:44.479 align:start position:0%
much much more to follow what was once
 
02:23:47.030 --> 02:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
done on the cover of emission omission
 
02:23:50.150 --> 02:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
is now done openly and brazenly cheered
 
02:23:54.230 --> 02:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
on by those who in an act of bad faith
 
02:23:55.990 --> 02:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
claim to be upholders of the first
 
02:23:58.070 --> 02:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
amendment and the importance of
 
02:24:00.950 --> 02:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
a free debate in a democracy
 
02:24:03.389 --> 02:24:03.399 align:start position:0%
we are quickly slipping into an unreal
 
02:24:05.750 --> 02:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
totalitarian social order
 
02:24:07.349 --> 02:24:07.359 align:start position:0%
end of curtain quote
 
02:24:09.030 --> 02:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
fraud and crime the definition of
 
02:24:11.110 --> 02:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
terrorism is simply to terrorize the
 
02:24:13.990 --> 02:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
public for political ends such
 
02:24:16.389 --> 02:24:16.399 align:start position:0%
terrorizing is precisely what has been
 
02:24:18.230 --> 02:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
going on especially over the past two
 
02:24:19.750 --> 02:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
years at
 
02:24:21.590 --> 02:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
the hands of the globalist controlled
 
02:24:23.830 --> 02:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
entity that once was the legitimate

united states our beloved nation's
 
02:24:28.389 --> 02:24:28.399 align:start position:0%
political center has become an actual
 
02:24:31.190 --> 02:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
terrorist extremist government accusing
 
02:24:35.030 --> 02:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
its own citizens of its very own crimes
 
02:24:37.670 --> 02:24:37.680 align:start position:0%
in this saul alinsky style technique

anyone that disagrees with the
 
02:24:41.990 --> 02:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
government is unbelievable now labeled a
 
02:24:45.190 --> 02:24:45.200 align:start position:0%
domestic terrorist

cannot be abided or tolerated for an
 
02:24:54.550 --> 02:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
instant you members of this very
 
02:24:56.469 --> 02:24:56.479 align:start position:0%
committee cannot let this continue to
 
02:24:58.790 --> 02:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
happen you cannot
 
02:25:01.190 --> 02:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
fraud by a corrupt interest
 
02:25:04.150 --> 02:25:04.160 align:start position:0%
in december 2020 dr pierre cory was
 
02:25:06.710 --> 02:25:06.720 align:start position:0%

that some batches of the covet vaccines

are extremely poisonous while other

batches are much less so in legitimate
 
02:26:04.309 --> 02:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
medicine that situation would cause an

immediate halt to the vaccine program

have been halted instantly and

the result of it was that more than 8

out of 10 women in the study who could
 
02:27:02.389 --> 02:27:02.399 align:start position:0%
have a miscarriage

had one
 
02:27:05.830 --> 02:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
the authors of the study did everything
 
02:27:07.910 --> 02:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
in their power to commit fraud by hiding
 
02:27:09.110 --> 02:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
this result
 
02:27:10.870 --> 02:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
the shocking result was hidden
 
02:27:13.270 --> 02:27:13.280 align:start position:0%
fraudulently within the very time frames
 
02:27:15.590 --> 02:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
in the study for technically early
 
02:27:17.670 --> 02:27:17.680 align:start position:0%
births resulting in death are only
 
02:27:19.510 --> 02:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
called miscarriages if they are before
 
02:27:21.510 --> 02:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
the 20th week
 
02:27:24.070 --> 02:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
but the study hid its own results by
 
02:27:26.309 --> 02:27:26.319 align:start position:0%
doing the figuring as if all the women
 
02:27:28.070 --> 02:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
had started the study close to the
 
02:27:29.990 --> 02:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
beginning of their pregnancy whereas
 
02:27:32.389 --> 02:27:32.399 align:start position:0%
actually only small percentage of them
 
02:27:35.429 --> 02:27:35.439 align:start position:0%
had done that in this way
 
02:27:37.750 --> 02:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
the deeply disturbing miscarriages in
 
02:27:37.760 --> 02:27:39.349 align:start position:0%
the deeply disturbing miscarriages in
this

02:27:39.349 --> 02:27:39.359 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:27:42.230 --> 02:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
in this small subgroup were falsely
 
02:27:44.070 --> 02:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
given the statistical number of
 
02:27:46.469 --> 02:27:46.479 align:start position:0%
individual setting of the entire group
 
02:27:48.150 --> 02:27:48.160 align:start position:0%
rather than naturally using the number
 
02:27:50.790 --> 02:27:50.800 align:start position:0%
of individuals in the small early term
 
02:27:52.870 --> 02:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
group in the study the only group which
 
02:27:55.110 --> 02:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
was even capable of technically having
 
02:27:58.230 --> 02:27:58.240 align:start position:0%
any miscarriage abnormal early delivery
 
02:28:00.950 --> 02:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
in later pregnancy terms goes by other
 
02:28:05.750 --> 02:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:08.150 --> 02:28:08.160 align:start position:0%
faced with enemies if we have stood up
 
02:28:10.070 --> 02:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
if we stood on the new jersey or north
 
02:28:12.710 --> 02:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
carolina shore around 1943 watching an
 
02:28:15.510 --> 02:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
oil tanker ship go by on the horizon the
 
02:28:17.110 --> 02:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
ship might suddenly have exploded
 
02:28:19.590 --> 02:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
sending a huge cloud of giant fragments
 
02:28:21.590 --> 02:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
of ship into the air would we in the
 
02:28:21.600 --> 02:28:23.349 align:start position:0%
of ship into the air would we in the
newspapers

02:28:23.349 --> 02:28:23.359 align:start position:0%
newspapers
 
02:28:25.349 --> 02:28:25.359 align:start position:0%
weirdly and twistedly say about this
 
02:28:28.950 --> 02:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
event oh some patriotic domestic
 
02:28:33.190 --> 02:28:33.200 align:start position:0%
terrorist must have endangers us all
 
02:28:35.670 --> 02:28:35.680 align:start position:0%
by lighting a cigarette on that tanker
 
02:28:37.349 --> 02:28:37.359 align:start position:0%
causing it to blow up
 
02:28:39.349 --> 02:28:39.359 align:start position:0%
or instead would we
 
02:28:41.590 --> 02:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
would we in legit newspapers have
 
02:28:44.389 --> 02:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
realized using common sense oh another
 
02:28:46.230 --> 02:28:46.240 align:start position:0%
german submarine has struck our nation
 
02:28:47.990 --> 02:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
with a torpedo
 
02:28:51.190 --> 02:28:51.200 align:start position:0%
of course it was a torpedo by germans
 
02:28:52.830 --> 02:28:52.840 align:start position:0%
they wished us
 
02:28:55.750 --> 02:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
harm this is exactly the situation we
 
02:28:57.590 --> 02:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
find ourselves in today we are being
 
02:29:00.790 --> 02:29:00.800 align:start position:0%
attacked yes but not by our loyal
 
02:29:03.670 --> 02:29:03.680 align:start position:0%
american fellow citizens to get us to
 
02:29:07.030 --> 02:29:07.040 align:start position:0%
suspect or frame them as we are
 
02:29:08.870 --> 02:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
encouraged and even
 
02:29:10.950 --> 02:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
ordered to do is like
 
02:29:12.870 --> 02:29:12.880 align:start position:0%
the strange idea of suspecting a
 
02:29:16.309 --> 02:29:16.319 align:start position:0%
terrorist cigarette smoker on the 1943
 
02:29:18.150 --> 02:29:18.160 align:start position:0%
oil tanker
 
02:29:20.790 --> 02:29:20.800 align:start position:0%
so the ludicrous planted idea pushed by
 
02:29:23.270 --> 02:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
mockingbird media today that we the
 
02:29:25.030 --> 02:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
people are the enemy
 
02:29:26.950 --> 02:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
is a ruse
 
02:29:29.030 --> 02:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
the interests that are attacking us are
 
02:29:31.429 --> 02:29:31.439 align:start position:0%
non-american and they are super
 
02:29:34.469 --> 02:29:34.479 align:start position:0%
elite interests
 
02:29:37.190 --> 02:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
and i just want to close
 
02:29:38.630 --> 02:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
by saying
 
02:29:40.150 --> 02:29:40.160 align:start position:0%
and reminding
 
02:29:42.630 --> 02:29:42.640 align:start position:0%
everyone present
 
02:29:44.790 --> 02:29:44.800 align:start position:0%
and thank you for others who have
 
02:29:48.790 --> 02:29:48.800 align:start position:0%
invoked our divine father
 
02:29:48.800 --> 02:29:51.030 align:start position:0%
invoked our divine father
i

02:29:51.030 --> 02:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:29:53.510 --> 02:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
i want to remind everyone that
 
02:29:55.590 --> 02:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
our constitutions the state and the
 
02:29:58.230 --> 02:29:58.240 align:start position:0%
national constitution
 
02:29:59.670 --> 02:29:59.680 align:start position:0%
are firmly
 
02:29:59.680 --> 02:30:00.630 align:start position:0%
are firmly
based

02:30:00.630 --> 02:30:00.640 align:start position:0%
based
 
02:30:02.389 --> 02:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
on the principles of the ten
 
02:30:02.399 --> 02:30:05.030 align:start position:0%
on the principles of the ten
commandments

02:30:05.030 --> 02:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
commandments
 
02:30:07.110 --> 02:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
including the principles of thou shalt
 
02:30:08.710 --> 02:30:08.720 align:start position:0%
not covet
 
02:30:10.389 --> 02:30:10.399 align:start position:0%
thy neighbor's goods
 
02:30:13.190 --> 02:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
thy neighbor's house possessions and so
 
02:30:13.200 --> 02:30:15.590 align:start position:0%
thy neighbor's house possessions and so
forth

02:30:15.590 --> 02:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:18.309 --> 02:30:18.319 align:start position:0%
we see a society coming in that is the
 
02:30:20.710 --> 02:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
opposite of that
 
02:30:20.720 --> 02:30:21.910 align:start position:0%
opposite of that
i

02:30:21.910 --> 02:30:21.920 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:30:25.110 --> 02:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
saw a hearing of
 
02:30:28.309 --> 02:30:28.319 align:start position:0%
san diego california school board i
 
02:30:30.950 --> 02:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
believe it was the people came up
 
02:30:32.469 --> 02:30:32.479 align:start position:0%
before the committee they were given
 
02:30:34.950 --> 02:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
almost no time to speak
 
02:30:37.270 --> 02:30:37.280 align:start position:0%
they were very very wealthy people they
 
02:30:39.750 --> 02:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
were very very impressive and they bring
 
02:30:42.070 --> 02:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
up all kinds of
 
02:30:45.349 --> 02:30:45.359 align:start position:0%
of really strong points
 
02:30:48.309 --> 02:30:48.319 align:start position:0%
but i see very little mention
 
02:30:51.910 --> 02:30:51.920 align:start position:0%
of the lord who created us
 
02:30:55.030 --> 02:30:55.040 align:start position:0%
and without this recognition
 
02:30:57.750 --> 02:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
we are really cooked
 
02:31:00.870 --> 02:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
because i i am certain that the lord who
 
02:31:03.190 --> 02:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
created us is not happy
 
02:31:05.510 --> 02:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
with with what's going on
 
02:31:08.389 --> 02:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
and especially with the lack of
 
02:31:08.399 --> 02:31:10.070 align:start position:0%
and especially with the lack of
repentance

02:31:10.070 --> 02:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
repentance
 
02:31:12.469 --> 02:31:12.479 align:start position:0%
on the part of all of us in the american
 
02:31:12.479 --> 02:31:13.590 align:start position:0%
on the part of all of us in the american
public

02:31:13.590 --> 02:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
public
 
02:31:16.710 --> 02:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
of our once christian-based nation even
 
02:31:18.070 --> 02:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
the principle
 
02:31:20.389 --> 02:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
of separation of church and powers is
 
02:31:23.110 --> 02:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
directly from jesus christ
 
02:31:28.469 --> 02:31:28.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:28.479 --> 02:31:30.230 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:31:30.230 --> 02:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:31:32.150 --> 02:31:32.160 align:start position:0%
with that
 
02:31:34.630 --> 02:31:34.640 align:start position:0%
i thank you so much and i'm so glad that
 
02:31:35.830 --> 02:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not
 
02:31:35.840 --> 02:31:37.270 align:start position:0%
i'm not
in

02:31:37.270 --> 02:31:37.280 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:31:39.429 --> 02:31:39.439 align:start position:0%
the vermont
 
02:31:41.590 --> 02:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
house right now
 
02:31:45.830 --> 02:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
where there is very very little chance
 
02:31:49.349 --> 02:31:49.359 align:start position:0%

speech
and

02:33:04.550 --> 02:33:04.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:33:05.910 --> 02:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
our rights that are god-given
 
02:33:08.710 --> 02:33:08.720 align:start position:0%

and
 
02:33:18.389 --> 02:33:18.399 align:start position:0%
i see
 
02:33:20.950 --> 02:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
pretty much everything that's happening
 
02:33:22.469 --> 02:33:22.479 align:start position:0%
around the
 
02:33:22.479 --> 02:33:24.469 align:start position:0%
around the
government

02:33:24.469 --> 02:33:24.479 align:start position:0%
government
 
02:33:27.030 --> 02:33:27.040 align:start position:0%
intrusion into our health especially
 
02:33:28.710 --> 02:33:28.720 align:start position:0%
around this covid
 
02:33:31.510 --> 02:33:31.520 align:start position:0%
treatment and so forth is a complete
 
02:33:33.750 --> 02:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
violation of our rights violation of our
 
02:33:36.550 --> 02:33:36.560 align:start position:0%
fourth amendment right to begin with
 
02:33:36.560 --> 02:33:37.429 align:start position:0%
fourth amendment right to begin with
and

02:33:37.429 --> 02:33:37.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:33:40.389 --> 02:33:40.399 align:start position:0%
i see the world around us
 
02:33:41.830 --> 02:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
and i think i don't think there's
 
02:33:44.309 --> 02:33:44.319 align:start position:0%
anybody that would dispute this
 
02:33:47.190 --> 02:33:47.200 align:start position:0%
i see the world around me and us turning
 
02:33:50.070 --> 02:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:53.429 --> 02:33:53.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:55.590 --> 02:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
the bible tells us that
 
02:33:58.150 --> 02:33:58.160 align:start position:0%
the wicked and the nations that forget
 
02:33:58.160 --> 02:33:59.750 align:start position:0%
the wicked and the nations that forget
god

02:33:59.750 --> 02:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
god
 
02:34:02.150 --> 02:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
are turned into hell and i say that's
 
02:34:04.070 --> 02:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
exactly what's happening
 
02:34:06.230 --> 02:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
and we as jay said we have a chance now
 
02:34:08.550 --> 02:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
we have a chance thank you god we have a
 
02:34:11.110 --> 02:34:11.120 align:start position:0%
chance to repent which means to turn
 
02:34:14.070 --> 02:34:14.080 align:start position:0%
from our wicked ways and turn toward god
 
02:34:15.670 --> 02:34:15.680 align:start position:0%
and that's for everybody i'm not really
 
02:34:18.950 --> 02:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
just speaking to you folks it's to me
 
02:34:21.590 --> 02:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
it's to all of us
 
02:34:21.600 --> 02:34:23.030 align:start position:0%
it's to all of us
and

02:34:23.030 --> 02:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:34:26.070 --> 02:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
so there are some very very brave people
 
02:34:27.910 --> 02:34:27.920 align:start position:0%
physicians and highly credentialed
 
02:34:29.910 --> 02:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
credible physicians all around the world
 
02:34:31.750 --> 02:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
too many to to mention
 
02:34:33.110 --> 02:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to mention a few of them
 
02:34:35.590 --> 02:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
jay mentioned pierre quarry
 
02:34:37.670 --> 02:34:37.680 align:start position:0%
and his testimony before congress that
 
02:34:40.630 --> 02:34:40.640 align:start position:0%
ivor mexton is the
 
02:34:43.270 --> 02:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
there's been 61 studies done worldwide
 
02:34:45.429 --> 02:34:45.439 align:start position:0%
at this point that prove peer-reviewed
 
02:34:45.439 --> 02:34:46.790 align:start position:0%
at this point that prove peer-reviewed
studies

02:34:46.790 --> 02:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
studies
 
02:34:49.750 --> 02:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
that prove that ivermectin is
 
02:34:52.469 --> 02:34:52.479 align:start position:0%
almost 100 percent effective in treating
 
02:34:54.790 --> 02:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
covid especially when given as effective
 
02:34:56.830 --> 02:34:56.840 align:start position:0%
early outpatient
 
02:35:00.070 --> 02:35:00.080 align:start position:0%
treatment did you know
 
02:35:02.070 --> 02:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
that 99
 
02:35:05.270 --> 02:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
of the deaths from colvin occur where
 
02:35:06.550 --> 02:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
anybody know
 
02:35:08.950 --> 02:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
in hospitals why
 
02:35:10.550 --> 02:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
could it be because they're given rem
 
02:35:13.349 --> 02:35:13.359 align:start position:0%
deserver which is a is a disastrous drug
 
02:35:14.950 --> 02:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
that does in the kidneys
 
02:35:17.110 --> 02:35:17.120 align:start position:0%
and floods the lungs with fluid and then
 
02:35:18.550 --> 02:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
they're put on a
 
02:35:18.560 --> 02:35:19.830 align:start position:0%
they're put on a
ventilator

02:35:19.830 --> 02:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
ventilator
 
02:35:22.070 --> 02:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
um i'll tell you what zeb zolenko has to
 
02:35:24.070 --> 02:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
say about this dr zev zelenko in an
 
02:35:26.070 --> 02:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
interview by the way i've sent you
 
02:35:27.910 --> 02:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
videos and documentation of everything
 
02:35:30.550 --> 02:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
that i'm saying
 
02:35:32.870 --> 02:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
dr zebzalenko who has been effectively
 
02:35:34.870 --> 02:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
treating covid
 
02:35:37.670 --> 02:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
since the get-go effectively treating it
 
02:35:39.349 --> 02:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
in an interview i think it was a couple
 
02:35:42.150 --> 02:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
days ago basically said
 
02:35:44.070 --> 02:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
that what's going on with covet and the
 
02:35:45.550 --> 02:35:45.560 align:start position:0%
treatment of it right now is
 
02:35:48.870 --> 02:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
pre-meditated first-degree murder
 
02:35:50.630 --> 02:35:50.640 align:start position:0%
and genocide
 
02:35:53.429 --> 02:35:53.439 align:start position:0%
of at least 750 000 americans i think
 
02:35:55.030 --> 02:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
he's being kind there because it's
 
02:35:55.040 --> 02:35:57.270 align:start position:0%
he's being kind there because it's
worldwide

02:35:57.270 --> 02:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
worldwide
 
02:35:57.280 --> 02:36:01.670 align:start position:0%
worldwide
um

02:36:01.670 --> 02:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:03.590 --> 02:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
so that's to be paid attention to i mean
 
02:36:03.600 --> 02:36:04.389 align:start position:0%
so that's to be paid attention to i mean
we

02:36:04.389 --> 02:36:04.399 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:36:06.469 --> 02:36:06.479 align:start position:0%
what what is this are we living in nazi
 
02:36:08.070 --> 02:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
germany right now i don't i don't think
 
02:36:09.910 --> 02:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
so i think this is nazi germany on
 
02:36:09.920 --> 02:36:11.750 align:start position:0%
so i think this is nazi germany on
steroids

02:36:11.750 --> 02:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
steroids
 
02:36:14.630 --> 02:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
in the 1930s
 
02:36:14.640 --> 02:36:15.750 align:start position:0%
in the 1930s
people

02:36:15.750 --> 02:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:36:17.030 --> 02:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
kind of would they would turn their head
 
02:36:18.710 --> 02:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
the other way they were afraid to speak
 
02:36:20.150 --> 02:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
up they didn't speak up while their
 
02:36:21.590 --> 02:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
grandmothers and their children were
 
02:36:23.510 --> 02:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
carted off to auschwitz
 
02:36:25.830 --> 02:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
to be gassed to death what are we doing
 
02:36:25.840 --> 02:36:26.710 align:start position:0%
to be gassed to death what are we doing
now

02:36:26.710 --> 02:36:26.720 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:36:28.950 --> 02:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
what is the general public doing now
 
02:36:30.469 --> 02:36:30.479 align:start position:0%
they've been very in a very
 
02:36:30.479 --> 02:36:32.150 align:start position:0%
they've been very in a very
sophisticated

02:36:32.150 --> 02:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
sophisticated
 
02:36:34.150 --> 02:36:34.160 align:start position:0%
manner it seems that they've been mind
 
02:36:35.750 --> 02:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
controlled and brainwashed i mean it has
 
02:36:37.750 --> 02:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
to be something like that plus the
 
02:36:39.429 --> 02:36:39.439 align:start position:0%
forgetting of god
 
02:36:42.950 --> 02:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:44.469 --> 02:36:44.479 align:start position:0%
it has to be something like that because
 
02:36:46.230 --> 02:36:46.240 align:start position:0%
people won't talk about it
 
02:36:48.150 --> 02:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
our nation has been very deliberately
 
02:36:49.670 --> 02:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
divided this the whole thing that's
 
02:36:51.990 --> 02:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
going on this coveted thing is one big
 
02:36:55.030 --> 02:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
piece of a much larger puzzle of the
 
02:36:56.790 --> 02:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
intentional deliberate long-term
 
02:36:58.630 --> 02:36:58.640 align:start position:0%
takedown and coupe of the united states
 
02:36:59.910 --> 02:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
of america
 
02:37:01.590 --> 02:37:01.600 align:start position:0%
the greatest nation on the upon the
 
02:37:02.790 --> 02:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
earth why
 
02:37:04.790 --> 02:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
because we are and we were the last
 
02:37:07.270 --> 02:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
bastion of freedom
 
02:37:09.429 --> 02:37:09.439 align:start position:0%
for the rest of the world are we just
 
02:37:11.990 --> 02:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
going to sit here and do nothing
 
02:37:13.510 --> 02:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
and let
 
02:37:14.950 --> 02:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
the whole world
 
02:37:18.550 --> 02:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
go you know where are we no
 
02:37:21.110 --> 02:37:21.120 align:start position:0%

we love this nation we love what god
 
02:37:27.910 --> 02:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
gave us thank you god the very values
 
02:37:30.830 --> 02:37:30.840 align:start position:0%
and principles upon which this nation is
 
02:37:33.510 --> 02:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
founded are reflections of the very
 
02:37:36.150 --> 02:37:36.160 align:start position:0%
values of god himself
 
02:37:38.389 --> 02:37:38.399 align:start position:0%
and we are duty-bound to stand up for
 
02:37:40.230 --> 02:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
those to stand up for truth and what is
 
02:37:42.870 --> 02:37:42.880 align:start position:0%
right and good
 
02:37:42.880 --> 02:37:45.429 align:start position:0%
right and good
so

02:37:45.429 --> 02:37:45.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:47.190 --> 02:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
in sweden
 
02:37:49.190 --> 02:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
they didn't mask
 
02:37:51.750 --> 02:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
they didn't social distance what's the
 
02:37:53.590 --> 02:37:53.600 align:start position:0%
other thing that everybody's doing they
 
02:37:55.429 --> 02:37:55.439 align:start position:0%
they did none of that
 
02:37:58.950 --> 02:37:58.960 align:start position:0%
and they have 1.8 million children
 
02:38:01.670 --> 02:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
and zero deaths from covid
 
02:38:03.349 --> 02:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
isn't that interesting
 
02:38:04.710 --> 02:38:04.720 align:start position:0%
but of course we won't hear about that
 
02:38:07.190 --> 02:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
on mainstream media i suggest that
 
02:38:09.590 --> 02:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
anybody who's still watching mainstream
 
02:38:09.600 --> 02:38:11.429 align:start position:0%
anybody who's still watching mainstream
media

02:38:11.429 --> 02:38:11.439 align:start position:0%
media
 
02:38:13.510 --> 02:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
or listening to the
 
02:38:13.520 --> 02:38:14.710 align:start position:0%
or listening to the
hypnotic

02:38:14.710 --> 02:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
hypnotic
 
02:38:17.190 --> 02:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
droning voices of npr
 
02:38:17.200 --> 02:38:18.230 align:start position:0%
droning voices of npr
national

02:38:18.230 --> 02:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
national
 
02:38:20.150 --> 02:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
propaganda radio that you shut those
 
02:38:22.710 --> 02:38:22.720 align:start position:0%
things off if you're still buying into
 
02:38:24.309 --> 02:38:24.319 align:start position:0%
the lies
 
02:38:26.230 --> 02:38:26.240 align:start position:0%
you've please i please god help
 
02:38:28.950 --> 02:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
everybody that is buying into laws open
 
02:38:30.790 --> 02:38:30.800 align:start position:0%
their eyes and remove the scales from
 
02:38:32.230 --> 02:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
our eyes
 
02:38:34.630 --> 02:38:34.640 align:start position:0%
open our hearts lord help us to to see
 
02:38:37.110 --> 02:38:37.120 align:start position:0%
what's really going on and to stand up
 
02:38:38.630 --> 02:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
against it
 
02:38:40.389 --> 02:38:40.399 align:start position:0%
dr michael yaden
 
02:38:43.830 --> 02:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
the former vice president of of pfizer
 
02:38:46.230 --> 02:38:46.240 align:start position:0%
and at that time he was their chief
 
02:38:48.870 --> 02:38:48.880 align:start position:0%
medical scientist
 
02:38:51.110 --> 02:38:51.120 align:start position:0%
says that for every listen to this this
 
02:38:53.110 --> 02:38:53.120 align:start position:0%
is really important
 
02:38:55.670 --> 02:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
he he's a man of
 
02:38:57.750 --> 02:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
undeniable credibility
 
02:39:01.270 --> 02:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
he says that for every one child
 
02:39:03.750 --> 02:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
that dies from coved guess how many
 
02:39:06.230 --> 02:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
would die from the vaccine
 
02:39:06.240 --> 02:39:07.510 align:start position:0%
would die from the vaccine
100.

02:39:07.510 --> 02:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
100.
 
02:39:07.520 --> 02:39:08.389 align:start position:0%
100.
now

02:39:08.389 --> 02:39:08.399 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:39:10.469 --> 02:39:10.479 align:start position:0%
what kind of odds is that to to march
 
02:39:11.990 --> 02:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
your child off to
 
02:39:13.990 --> 02:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
to get their vaccine oh but guess what
 
02:39:15.750 --> 02:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
you don't have to march your child off
 
02:39:17.830 --> 02:39:17.840 align:start position:0%
anymore because the who says
 
02:39:17.840 --> 02:39:18.710 align:start position:0%
anymore because the who says
that

02:39:18.710 --> 02:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:39:20.469 --> 02:39:20.479 align:start position:0%
just sending your child to public school
 
02:39:21.990 --> 02:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
or to any school
 
02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:22.710 align:start position:0%
or to any school
um

02:39:22.710 --> 02:39:22.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:24.469 --> 02:39:24.479 align:start position:0%
implies consent
 
02:39:28.070 --> 02:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
now how insane is that
 
02:39:30.309 --> 02:39:30.319 align:start position:0%
i mean really who who would who would go
 
02:39:32.150 --> 02:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
along with this well the who would and
 
02:39:34.550 --> 02:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
who do they think they are
 
02:39:34.560 --> 02:39:35.670 align:start position:0%
who do they think they are
suddenly

02:39:35.670 --> 02:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
suddenly
 
02:39:37.510 --> 02:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
people are
 
02:39:39.270 --> 02:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
falling down all over the place and
 
02:39:41.429 --> 02:39:41.439 align:start position:0%
lapping up the most absurd things like
 
02:39:44.070 --> 02:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
the fact that thinking that the who
 
02:39:46.950 --> 02:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
has any kind of authority whatsoever or
 
02:39:48.469 --> 02:39:48.479 align:start position:0%
that the state does to tell you what to
 
02:39:50.830 --> 02:39:50.840 align:start position:0%
do with your children
 
02:39:53.190 --> 02:39:53.200 align:start position:0%
really and
 
02:39:54.550 --> 02:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
other other
 
02:39:55.990 --> 02:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
sources of
 
02:39:58.469 --> 02:39:58.479 align:start position:0%
authority that people are just lapping
 
02:40:00.550 --> 02:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
up oh bill gates let's see he's not a
 
02:40:03.590 --> 02:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
doctor he has his finger in every pie
 
02:40:06.230 --> 02:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
he has been into eugenics and
 
02:40:09.349 --> 02:40:09.359 align:start position:0%
depopulation for decades
 
02:40:12.150 --> 02:40:12.160 align:start position:0%
and has stated pretty strongly about re
 
02:40:14.070 --> 02:40:14.080 align:start position:0%
reducing the world population by 10 to
 
02:40:17.269 --> 02:40:17.279 align:start position:0%
15 that's probably it's probably being
 
02:40:19.269 --> 02:40:19.279 align:start position:0%
understated when he says that but
 
02:40:21.429 --> 02:40:21.439 align:start position:0%
everybody just totally accepts that he
 
02:40:23.510 --> 02:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
has his finger in every pie
 
02:40:25.750 --> 02:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
and looks the other way so anyway all of
 
02:40:28.550 --> 02:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
this is a is part of destabilizing
 
02:40:28.560 --> 02:40:30.309 align:start position:0%
this is a is part of destabilizing
demoralizing

02:40:30.309 --> 02:40:30.319 align:start position:0%
demoralizing
 
02:40:31.670 --> 02:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
this nation
 
02:40:31.680 --> 02:40:32.550 align:start position:0%
this nation
to

02:40:32.550 --> 02:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:40:33.990 --> 02:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
bring us down so they can bring in
 
02:40:38.469 --> 02:40:38.479 align:start position:0%
tyrannical beyond tyrannicals it's it's
 
02:40:38.479 --> 02:40:39.429 align:start position:0%
tyrannical beyond tyrannicals it's it's
germany

02:40:39.429 --> 02:40:39.439 align:start position:0%
germany
 
02:40:42.230 --> 02:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
in the 1930s on steroids folks
 
02:40:44.309 --> 02:40:44.319 align:start position:0%
we have to wake up to that
 
02:40:44.319 --> 02:40:45.110 align:start position:0%
we have to wake up to that
um

02:40:45.110 --> 02:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:45.120 --> 02:40:45.990 align:start position:0%
um
so

02:40:45.990 --> 02:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:40:48.469 --> 02:40:48.479 align:start position:0%
even if this vaccine were perfectly
 
02:40:50.790 --> 02:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
wonderful government has no right to
 
02:40:53.110 --> 02:40:53.120 align:start position:0%
mandate that or anything else like the
 
02:40:55.750 --> 02:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
masks the lockdowns those are that's
 
02:40:58.550 --> 02:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
totally completely a violation of our of
 
02:41:00.469 --> 02:41:00.479 align:start position:0%
our constitutional rights
 
02:41:03.429 --> 02:41:03.439 align:start position:0%
people in general would comply
 
02:41:05.670 --> 02:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
on their own if they wanted to but we
 
02:41:07.030 --> 02:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
will not
 
02:41:07.040 --> 02:41:08.230 align:start position:0%
will not
comply

02:41:08.230 --> 02:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
comply
 
02:41:08.240 --> 02:41:10.150 align:start position:0%
comply
to

02:41:10.150 --> 02:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:41:13.190 --> 02:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
the absurd and
 
02:41:15.349 --> 02:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
genocidal things that are happening in
 
02:41:17.590 --> 02:41:17.600 align:start position:0%
this nation no we will call them out
 
02:41:19.429 --> 02:41:19.439 align:start position:0%
as we're doing here today and and on
 
02:41:19.439 --> 02:41:20.950 align:start position:0%
as we're doing here today and and on
tuesday

02:41:20.950 --> 02:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
tuesday
 
02:41:20.960 --> 02:41:22.309 align:start position:0%
tuesday
so

02:41:22.309 --> 02:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:41:24.150 --> 02:41:24.160 align:start position:0%
as a nation
 
02:41:26.309 --> 02:41:26.319 align:start position:0%
we're we're in tough shape we're in
 
02:41:27.670 --> 02:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
tough shape you know
 
02:41:29.429 --> 02:41:29.439 align:start position:0%
what did ben franklin say to the woman
 
02:41:31.349 --> 02:41:31.359 align:start position:0%
who said do you have a was it a monarchy
 
02:41:33.990 --> 02:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
or a republican he said a republic man
 
02:41:37.190 --> 02:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
if you can keep it can we keep it
 
02:41:39.990 --> 02:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
with god's help i think that's the only
 
02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:40.950 align:start position:0%
with god's help i think that's the only
way

02:41:40.950 --> 02:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
way
 
02:41:42.230 --> 02:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:41:43.190 --> 02:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
one minute
 
02:41:45.510 --> 02:41:45.520 align:start position:0%
i guess two more things to say
 
02:41:47.830 --> 02:41:47.840 align:start position:0%
where there is the spirit of the lord
 
02:41:49.910 --> 02:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
there is liberty
 
02:41:51.830 --> 02:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
without it forget it
 
02:41:51.840 --> 02:41:52.710 align:start position:0%
without it forget it
so

02:41:52.710 --> 02:41:52.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:41:55.750 --> 02:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
king asa in second chronicles chapter 14
 
02:41:57.750 --> 02:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
verse 11
 
02:41:59.349 --> 02:41:59.359 align:start position:0%
was going out to battle against
 
02:42:01.269 --> 02:42:01.279 align:start position:0%
unimaginable odds which is what we're up
 
02:42:02.790 --> 02:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
against it's
 
02:42:04.150 --> 02:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
like nothing that's ever been seen on
 
02:42:06.070 --> 02:42:06.080 align:start position:0%
the face of the earth before
 
02:42:06.080 --> 02:42:07.269 align:start position:0%
the face of the earth before
and

02:42:07.269 --> 02:42:07.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:42:09.349 --> 02:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
he was told by a prophet that he had to
 
02:42:12.070 --> 02:42:12.080 align:start position:0%
always ask for god's help and not to
 
02:42:14.950 --> 02:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
rely on himself or other people it's not
 
02:42:17.190 --> 02:42:17.200 align:start position:0%
like we we really have to do everything
 
02:42:19.670 --> 02:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
we can do everything
 
02:42:21.990 --> 02:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
but he cried out to the lord
 
02:42:24.790 --> 02:42:24.800 align:start position:0%
and asa cried unto under his god and
 
02:42:28.230 --> 02:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
said lord it is nothing would be to help
 
02:42:30.150 --> 02:42:30.160 align:start position:0%
whether with many or with them that have
 
02:42:33.670 --> 02:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
no power help us o lord our god for we
 
02:42:36.469 --> 02:42:36.479 align:start position:0%
rest on thee and in thy name we go
 
02:42:38.710 --> 02:42:38.720 align:start position:0%
against this multitude o lord thou art
 
02:42:41.910 --> 02:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
our god let not man prevail against thee
 
02:42:43.510 --> 02:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
and i ask this in the name of jesus
 
02:42:43.520 --> 02:42:44.710 align:start position:0%
and i ask this in the name of jesus
christ

02:42:44.710 --> 02:42:44.720 align:start position:0%
christ
 
02:42:46.469 --> 02:42:46.479 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for listening i really
 
02:42:48.630 --> 02:42:48.640 align:start position:0%

02:42:51.349 --> 02:42:51.359 align:start position:0%

um
 
02:42:55.030 --> 02:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
contemplate deeply that this is a deep
 
02:42:56.950 --> 02:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
spiritual matter
 
02:42:58.389 --> 02:42:58.399 align:start position:0%
that we're dealing with it's
 
02:43:00.469 --> 02:43:00.479 align:start position:0%
individually we all
 
02:43:02.150 --> 02:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
i'm no different than you guys or
 
02:43:05.349 --> 02:43:05.359 align:start position:0%
anybody else we are all facing huge
 
02:43:08.870 --> 02:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
spiritual inward battles may god help us
 
02:43:11.429 --> 02:43:11.439 align:start position:0%
thank you kathleen
 
02:43:13.190 --> 02:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
our last speaker of the day will be
 
02:43:18.710 --> 02:43:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:20.230 --> 02:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
again elliott because you've already
 
02:43:22.070 --> 02:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
spoken months before you have no more
 
02:43:23.590 --> 02:43:23.600 align:start position:0%
than five minutes yes sir thank you
 
02:43:25.510 --> 02:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
thanks for having me back
 
02:43:28.870 --> 02:43:28.880 align:start position:0%
so according to the inflated statistics
 
02:43:28.880 --> 02:43:29.990 align:start position:0%
so according to the inflated statistics
uh

02:43:29.990 --> 02:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:43:31.670 --> 02:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
the highest amount of children that have
 
02:43:33.750 --> 02:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
died of covet over the past year year
 
02:43:34.790 --> 02:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
and a half
 
02:43:37.349 --> 02:43:37.359 align:start position:0%
is right around 200 so i thought it was
 
02:43:38.389 --> 02:43:38.399 align:start position:0%
going to be a lot more because of all
 
02:43:39.910 --> 02:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
the propaganda that even i believed a
 
02:43:41.110 --> 02:43:41.120 align:start position:0%
little bit i thought it was going to be
 
02:43:42.389 --> 02:43:42.399 align:start position:0%
in the thousands but i looked at all the
 
02:43:45.830 --> 02:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
stats the aap the cdc right now 200 250
 
02:43:47.750 --> 02:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
under 21 year olds have died in the last
 
02:43:48.950 --> 02:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
two years
 
02:43:51.750 --> 02:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
um and because of that number around 200
 
02:43:53.990 --> 02:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
kids have died of kovid we shut down the
 
02:43:55.990 --> 02:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
world like never before in history first
 
02:43:57.429 --> 02:43:57.439 align:start position:0%
time in history of existence that i know
 
02:43:59.510 --> 02:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
we shut down schools locked kids up in
 
02:44:01.670 --> 02:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
houses and and put masks on them and now
 
02:44:04.150 --> 02:44:04.160 align:start position:0%
we're forcing vaccines on them so um you
 
02:44:05.750 --> 02:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
know if that's reasonable which almost
 
02:44:07.190 --> 02:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
every politician in the world believes
 
02:44:08.710 --> 02:44:08.720 align:start position:0%
that that was reasonable i think that
 
02:44:10.309 --> 02:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
it's also reasonable to
 
02:44:12.710 --> 02:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
uh do every single mitigation strategy
 
02:44:14.469 --> 02:44:14.479 align:start position:0%
for everything that kills more than 200
 
02:44:16.070 --> 02:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
kids so if let's say there was something
 
02:44:18.630 --> 02:44:18.640 align:start position:0%
out there that killed 300 or 500 kids a
 
02:44:20.309 --> 02:44:20.319 align:start position:0%
year we should take every single
 
02:44:22.469 --> 02:44:22.479 align:start position:0%
precaution necessary even if it means
 
02:44:25.429 --> 02:44:25.439 align:start position:0%
disrupting other uh quality of life
 
02:44:26.870 --> 02:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
so for instance
 
02:44:28.950 --> 02:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
chronic lower respiratory diseases kill
 
02:44:32.150 --> 02:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
274 kids a year so to stop all chronic
 
02:44:34.230 --> 02:44:34.240 align:start position:0%
respiratory lower disease like copd or
 
02:44:36.309 --> 02:44:36.319 align:start position:0%
in kids uh maybe cf or other lung
 
02:44:39.590 --> 02:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
disease let's ban all smoking mandate
 
02:44:41.349 --> 02:44:41.359 align:start position:0%
air purity filters in every single boom
 
02:44:43.030 --> 02:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
in the entire united states and let's
 
02:44:45.030 --> 02:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
ban all e-cigarettes and vaping
 
02:44:47.750 --> 02:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
340 kids die every year of fires and
 
02:44:49.830 --> 02:44:49.840 align:start position:0%
burns you know fires and burns and ems
 
02:44:52.070 --> 02:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
it is very very rare but 340 so more
 
02:44:54.469 --> 02:44:54.479 align:start position:0%
than covet kids die from fires and burns
 
02:44:55.670 --> 02:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
i think that you guys should propose a
 
02:44:57.030 --> 02:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
bill next year or amend one of the bills
 
02:44:58.710 --> 02:44:58.720 align:start position:0%
because too late for this year amend the
 
02:45:00.790 --> 02:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
bill to mandate every room in new
 
02:45:01.750 --> 02:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire have at least one fire
 
02:45:03.910 --> 02:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
extinguisher and maybe even mandate
 
02:45:05.830 --> 02:45:05.840 align:start position:0%
every kid walk around 24 7 and fire
 
02:45:08.389 --> 02:45:08.399 align:start position:0%
proof fire retardant clothes um because
 
02:45:11.990 --> 02:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
that would save 340 lives uh 599 kids
 
02:45:13.590 --> 02:45:13.600 align:start position:0%
every year diet heart disease it's
 
02:45:17.510 --> 02:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
probably congenital heart disease um 979
 
02:45:20.309 --> 02:45:20.319 align:start position:0%
die from congenital anomalies
 
02:45:22.870 --> 02:45:22.880 align:start position:0%
982 die from drug overdose and poisoning
 
02:45:24.990 --> 02:45:25.000 align:start position:0%
let's ban all poison substances
 
02:45:27.190 --> 02:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
995 almost a thousand way more than
 
02:45:29.269 --> 02:45:29.279 align:start position:0%
coven die from drowning i think we
 
02:45:31.670 --> 02:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
should uh ban all pools in new hampshire
 
02:45:33.910 --> 02:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
let's propose a bill to ban all pools um
 
02:45:35.269 --> 02:45:35.279 align:start position:0%
i got rid of my pool so i'm doing my
 
02:45:37.510 --> 02:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
part and let's mandate water wings
 
02:45:39.590 --> 02:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
floatation devices on every kid below 21
 
02:45:41.510 --> 02:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
years old 24 7 to walk around in case
 
02:45:42.870 --> 02:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
they drown because again that would save
 
02:45:44.150 --> 02:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
more lives than all the mitigation for
 
02:45:47.670 --> 02:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
kobe right so uh 1430 over a thousand
 
02:45:49.510 --> 02:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
kids die of suffocation from choking on
 
02:45:52.710 --> 02:45:52.720 align:start position:0%
things every year so um let's ban kids
 
02:45:54.469 --> 02:45:54.479 align:start position:0%
from eating small things i guess and
 
02:45:55.910 --> 02:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
let's mandate that every single group in
 
02:45:56.950 --> 02:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
02:45:59.429 --> 02:45:59.439 align:start position:0%
have uh a device to get something out of
 
02:46:01.190 --> 02:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
someone's throat like a life back or
 
02:46:02.550 --> 02:46:02.560 align:start position:0%
maybe advanced area equipment like
 
02:46:05.030 --> 02:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
intubation or uh other mcgill forceps or
 
02:46:07.190 --> 02:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
something like that what else um oh
 
02:46:09.590 --> 02:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
malignant neoplasm so cancer kills 1800
 
02:46:10.870 --> 02:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
as we know there are things we do to get
 
02:46:14.070 --> 02:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
rid of cancer and over 3 000 kids die in
 
02:46:16.469 --> 02:46:16.479 align:start position:0%
firearm related injuries let's uh bail
 
02:46:17.990 --> 02:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
all guns i guess
 
02:46:19.510 --> 02:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
so i guess all firearms have to be
 
02:46:20.950 --> 02:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
banned if we're going to do everything
 
02:46:21.990 --> 02:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
to save kids because again it would save
 
02:46:24.710 --> 02:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
kids lives and over 4 000 kids die every
 
02:46:26.070 --> 02:46:26.080 align:start position:0%
year the number one killer of kids every
 
02:46:28.150 --> 02:46:28.160 align:start position:0%
year is motor vehicle accidents again
 
02:46:30.309 --> 02:46:30.319 align:start position:0%
ems for 10 years i've had a lot of
 
02:46:32.309 --> 02:46:32.319 align:start position:0%
motivated classes i've treated yes we
 
02:46:34.469 --> 02:46:34.479 align:start position:0%
all know kids do die from it so let's
 
02:46:36.389 --> 02:46:36.399 align:start position:0%
ban anyone from under 21 years old from
 
02:46:38.950 --> 02:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
being in a car um or you know mandate
 
02:46:40.790 --> 02:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
more air bags or let's pass more laws of
 
02:46:42.630 --> 02:46:42.640 align:start position:0%
mandating uh maybe five seat belts like
 
02:46:43.990 --> 02:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
a harness or race car drivers and a
 
02:46:45.510 --> 02:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
helmet whenever kids are in a car
 
02:46:46.790 --> 02:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
because again that would save four
 
02:46:49.269 --> 02:46:49.279 align:start position:0%
thousand lives and if we're gonna turn
 
02:46:50.950 --> 02:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
flip the world like we all know we shut
 
02:46:52.790 --> 02:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
down the world for a year two years like
 
02:46:53.910 --> 02:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
we've never done before in history of
 
02:46:56.309 --> 02:46:56.319 align:start position:0%
humanity for to save the max potential
 
02:46:58.070 --> 02:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
benefit was saving around 200 lives a
 
02:46:59.830 --> 02:46:59.840 align:start position:0%
year and again every life is important
 
02:47:01.429 --> 02:47:01.439 align:start position:0%
every death is a tragedy if we're going
 
02:47:02.870 --> 02:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
to shut down the world and crash the
 
02:47:04.389 --> 02:47:04.399 align:start position:0%
world economy biggest crash in the stock
 
02:47:05.910 --> 02:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
market in the world economy in history
 
02:47:08.309 --> 02:47:08.319 align:start position:0%
of existence so that the whole uh united
 
02:47:09.990 --> 02:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
states and world markets crashed if
 
02:47:11.590 --> 02:47:11.600 align:start position:0%
we're gonna do that for to save 200
 
02:47:13.590 --> 02:47:13.600 align:start position:0%
lives to save four thousand lives we
 
02:47:15.990 --> 02:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
should bail cars so again even if
 
02:47:17.670 --> 02:47:17.680 align:start position:0%
there's a cost to the mitigation the
 
02:47:19.110 --> 02:47:19.120 align:start position:0%
cost is worth the benefit but definitely
 
02:47:20.950 --> 02:47:20.960 align:start position:0%
banning all cars and banning all
 
02:47:22.950 --> 02:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
firearms banning all foods that cause
 
02:47:24.230 --> 02:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
cancer and heart disease and all the
 
02:47:25.429 --> 02:47:25.439 align:start position:0%
other things
 
02:47:27.110 --> 02:47:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh mandating flow changing
 
02:47:29.190 --> 02:47:29.200 align:start position:0%
device for every kid 24 7. that would
 
02:47:30.469 --> 02:47:30.479 align:start position:0%
save you know hundreds maybe a few
 
02:47:32.790 --> 02:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
thousand more lives so i i'm expecting
 
02:47:33.990 --> 02:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
to see all those bills proposed next
 
02:47:36.469 --> 02:47:36.479 align:start position:0%
year so thank you
 
02:47:38.550 --> 02:47:38.560 align:start position:0%
thank elliot i'm assuming a lot of that
 
02:47:40.870 --> 02:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
was sarcasm but um
 
02:47:44.469 --> 02:47:44.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:45.670 --> 02:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:47:47.510 --> 02:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
last night
 
02:47:50.230 --> 02:47:50.240 align:start position:0%
right that concludes uh all of the
 
02:47:52.309 --> 02:47:52.319 align:start position:0%
speakers that have asked that asked to
 
02:47:54.150 --> 02:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
speak or any other anybody else in the
 
02:47:58.230 --> 02:47:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:03.190 --> 02:48:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:06.150 --> 02:48:06.160 align:start position:0%
okay i i have a question did not the
 
02:48:06.160 --> 02:48:08.309 align:start position:0%
okay i i have a question did not the
governor

02:48:08.309 --> 02:48:08.319 align:start position:0%
governor
 
02:48:11.269 --> 02:48:11.279 align:start position:0%
nullify the emergency situation in new
 
02:48:14.150 --> 02:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire or am i wrong
 
02:48:16.469 --> 02:48:16.479 align:start position:0%
so i think if your question is around
 
02:48:18.230 --> 02:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
the current mandates through executive
 
02:48:20.790 --> 02:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
order and the uh the osha rule that was
 
02:48:22.230 --> 02:48:22.240 align:start position:0%
the emergency osha rule that was
 
02:48:24.150 --> 02:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
released the state of new hampshire did
 
02:48:26.950 --> 02:48:26.960 align:start position:0%
john on joining on to a federal lawsuit
 
02:48:29.590 --> 02:48:29.600 align:start position:0%
that federal lawsuit has
 
02:48:31.269 --> 02:48:31.279 align:start position:0%
the judge has issued an injunction
 
02:48:34.469 --> 02:48:34.479 align:start position:0%
stopping that stopping the um uh
 
02:48:36.150 --> 02:48:36.160 align:start position:0%
executive orders and the osha rules from
 
02:48:38.309 --> 02:48:38.319 align:start position:0%
going into effect so the best thing i
 
02:48:40.070 --> 02:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
can say right now is that the on the
 
02:48:42.070 --> 02:48:42.080 align:start position:0%
federal mandate side there's currently a
 
02:48:44.870 --> 02:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
pause in play that uh good in new
 
02:48:46.469 --> 02:48:46.479 align:start position:0%
hampshire in new hampshire and in
 
02:48:47.990 --> 02:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
closing why are they promoting the
 
02:48:49.750 --> 02:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
vaccines then
 
02:48:51.110 --> 02:48:51.120 align:start position:0%
okay it's not about it's not about
 
02:48:52.550 --> 02:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
promoting the vaccine it's about
 
02:48:54.230 --> 02:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
mandates so there's a difference there's
 
02:48:57.670 --> 02:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
a differential between those two things
 
02:48:59.269 --> 02:48:59.279 align:start position:0%
do you agree you can a public health
 
02:49:00.710 --> 02:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
official would say they believe that
 
02:49:01.990 --> 02:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
vaccines are good but there's a
 
02:49:04.389 --> 02:49:04.399 align:start position:0%
difference between saying public
 
02:49:06.630 --> 02:49:06.640 align:start position:0%
vaccines are good and you must get a
 
02:49:07.830 --> 02:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
vaccine those are two different
 
02:49:09.670 --> 02:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
statements don't you agree one involves
 
02:49:12.710 --> 02:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
choice one involves no choice and the
 
02:49:14.950 --> 02:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
the fact that the injunction is in play
 
02:49:18.230 --> 02:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
the the which had which was against the
 
02:49:20.150 --> 02:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
executive order for federal contractors
 
02:49:21.190 --> 02:49:21.200 align:start position:0%
and people
 
02:49:23.429 --> 02:49:23.439 align:start position:0%
and the uh osha rule which gave no
 
02:49:25.830 --> 02:49:25.840 align:start position:0%
choice well that's the latest that's the
 
02:49:27.349 --> 02:49:27.359 align:start position:0%
injection the injunction is currently in
 
02:49:27.359 --> 02:49:29.030 align:start position:0%
injection the injunction is currently in
place

02:49:29.030 --> 02:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
place
 
02:49:30.550 --> 02:49:30.560 align:start position:0%
so the injunction is current in play for
 
02:49:30.560 --> 02:49:31.349 align:start position:0%
so the injunction is current in play for
that

02:49:31.349 --> 02:49:31.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:49:33.590 --> 02:49:33.600 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry so the injunction has stopped
 
02:49:36.309 --> 02:49:36.319 align:start position:0%
that those that osha rule and the
 
02:49:37.990 --> 02:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
executive order are currently in in
 
02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:39.269 align:start position:0%
executive order are currently in in
effect

02:49:39.269 --> 02:49:39.279 align:start position:0%
effect
 
02:49:41.830 --> 02:49:41.840 align:start position:0%
okay um also
 
02:49:44.389 --> 02:49:44.399 align:start position:0%
i wanted to say that i heard on the
 
02:49:46.150 --> 02:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
internet that there were
 
02:49:49.429 --> 02:49:49.439 align:start position:0%
800 000 children between the ages of 5
 
02:49:53.670 --> 02:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
and 11 that have already been
 
02:49:56.389 --> 02:49:56.399 align:start position:0%
got the gene vaccine
 
02:49:59.110 --> 02:49:59.120 align:start position:0%
in the in the united states
 
02:50:01.830 --> 02:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
and also
 
02:50:04.790 --> 02:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
i wanted to add that when the university
 
02:50:06.790 --> 02:50:06.800 align:start position:0%
of pittsburgh
 
02:50:09.510 --> 02:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
takes these babies from the mother's
 
02:50:09.520 --> 02:50:10.710 align:start position:0%
takes these babies from the mother's
womb

02:50:10.710 --> 02:50:10.720 align:start position:0%
womb
 
02:50:13.510 --> 02:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
and their their full term babies
 
02:50:16.710 --> 02:50:16.720 align:start position:0%
when they take the organs out of the
 
02:50:20.830 --> 02:50:20.840 align:start position:0%
out of the baby the baby is
 
02:50:23.830 --> 02:50:23.840 align:start position:0%
awake and going through pain screaming
 
02:50:25.429 --> 02:50:25.439 align:start position:0%
and crying
 
02:50:25.439 --> 02:50:26.469 align:start position:0%
and crying
and

02:50:26.469 --> 02:50:26.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:50:28.870 --> 02:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
they only do this because they want to
 
02:50:32.070 --> 02:50:32.080 align:start position:0%
preserve the blood flow to the organs
 
02:50:35.990 --> 02:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
so that the organs can be sold
 
02:50:39.349 --> 02:50:39.359 align:start position:0%
and i think that's despicable
 
02:50:42.950 --> 02:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
i mean it's just inhuman
 
02:50:45.349 --> 02:50:45.359 align:start position:0%
so i wanted to clarify that
 
02:50:48.309 --> 02:50:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:51.269 --> 02:50:51.279 align:start position:0%
how does this committee
 
02:50:51.279 --> 02:50:52.710 align:start position:0%
how does this committee
um

02:50:52.710 --> 02:50:52.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:50:55.349 --> 02:50:55.359 align:start position:0%
are the is the public gonna hear from
 
02:50:57.349 --> 02:50:57.359 align:start position:0%
all the people that have written in
 
02:50:57.359 --> 02:50:58.550 align:start position:0%
all the people that have written in
somehow

02:50:58.550 --> 02:50:58.560 align:start position:0%
somehow
 
02:51:01.110 --> 02:51:01.120 align:start position:0%
because this is public viewing so most
 
02:51:02.870 --> 02:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
of the emails
 
02:51:04.150 --> 02:51:04.160 align:start position:0%
so most of the emails have been
 
02:51:05.429 --> 02:51:05.439 align:start position:0%
forwarded to the committee staffer
 
02:51:07.830 --> 02:51:07.840 align:start position:0%
that's managing the um
 
02:51:10.309 --> 02:51:10.319 align:start position:0%
uh docket if you will right the the
 
02:51:12.550 --> 02:51:12.560 align:start position:0%
paper papers we get from citizens go to
 
02:51:14.309 --> 02:51:14.319 align:start position:0%
that go to that person and they put it
 
02:51:15.910 --> 02:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
in the record
 
02:51:18.630 --> 02:51:18.640 align:start position:0%
excuse me in the file for the for the
 
02:51:18.640 --> 02:51:19.429 align:start position:0%
excuse me in the file for the for the
bill

02:51:19.429 --> 02:51:19.439 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:51:22.630 --> 02:51:22.640 align:start position:0%
so all of them be available to um
 
02:51:24.710 --> 02:51:24.720 align:start position:0%
to be read if somebody wants to at some
 
02:51:26.230 --> 02:51:26.240 align:start position:0%
point i think they do digitize them and
 
02:51:27.910 --> 02:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
put them online i'm not positive of that
 
02:51:29.429 --> 02:51:29.439 align:start position:0%
i'll be honest with you i hope they do
 
02:51:31.510 --> 02:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
that because i would like to read
 
02:51:34.230 --> 02:51:34.240 align:start position:0%
i'm sure as you can imagine we have lots
 
02:51:37.190 --> 02:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
of emails on this topic um and so it
 
02:51:40.309 --> 02:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
will be a pretty significant stack
 
02:51:42.150 --> 02:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
and that that record is also used as
 
02:51:43.990 --> 02:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
part of the court system so if someone
 
02:51:45.429 --> 02:51:45.439 align:start position:0%
was to challenge the law they would go
 
02:51:47.110 --> 02:51:47.120 align:start position:0%
back to see what was submitted and what
 
02:51:48.550 --> 02:51:48.560 align:start position:0%
was presented before the committee and
 
02:51:49.990 --> 02:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
they'd be able to read all those topics
 
02:51:52.870 --> 02:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
so again we've we've forwarded uh
 
02:51:55.030 --> 02:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
as many uh many of the emails through
 
02:51:56.469 --> 02:51:56.479 align:start position:0%
and i have more i've gotten this morning
 
02:51:57.670 --> 02:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
while we didn't have testimony which
 
02:51:58.550 --> 02:51:58.560 align:start position:0%
i'll forward to the committee
 
02:52:00.389 --> 02:52:00.399 align:start position:0%
researchers should be added to the the
 
02:52:03.670 --> 02:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
folder for our record so yes that
 
02:52:05.190 --> 02:52:05.200 align:start position:0%
information it will be made ultimately
 
02:52:06.870 --> 02:52:06.880 align:start position:0%
available for the public
 
02:52:09.110 --> 02:52:09.120 align:start position:0%
okay so if i come next week i'll be able
 
02:52:12.070 --> 02:52:12.080 align:start position:0%
to read some of their emails i will i
 
02:52:14.070 --> 02:52:14.080 align:start position:0%
don't know what their timeline is to get
 
02:52:16.070 --> 02:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
that digitized and into the system i
 
02:52:17.349 --> 02:52:17.359 align:start position:0%
have no idea
 
02:52:20.070 --> 02:52:20.080 align:start position:0%
again the vast majority of emails at
 
02:52:23.429 --> 02:52:23.439 align:start position:0%
least i've received are opposing the any
 
02:52:26.150 --> 02:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
any mandates um and there's been a very
 
02:52:28.150 --> 02:52:28.160 align:start position:0%
limited number of emails i've received
 
02:52:30.230 --> 02:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
that support the mandate okay thank you
 
02:52:33.750 --> 02:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:35.110 --> 02:52:35.120 align:start position:0%
sure step up to mike rowan if you have a
 
02:52:42.150 --> 02:52:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:44.150 --> 02:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
record i want to ask
 
02:52:45.670 --> 02:52:45.680 align:start position:0%
the whole committee each and every one
 
02:52:46.710 --> 02:52:46.720 align:start position:0%
of you
 
02:52:48.790 --> 02:52:48.800 align:start position:0%
you're under oath correct you took an
 
02:52:53.510 --> 02:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:55.670 --> 02:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
yes that's a standard yes
 
02:52:57.429 --> 02:52:57.439 align:start position:0%
every ops every every person takes
 
02:52:57.439 --> 02:52:59.349 align:start position:0%
every ops every every person takes
questions

02:52:59.349 --> 02:52:59.359 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:52:59.359 --> 02:53:01.030 align:start position:0%
questions
if

02:53:01.030 --> 02:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:53:04.070 --> 02:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
an experimental drug or a vaccine
 
02:53:06.309 --> 02:53:06.319 align:start position:0%
if you want to call it that
 
02:53:08.790 --> 02:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
if it is fda approved
 
02:53:10.630 --> 02:53:10.640 align:start position:0%
and this is a yes or no
 
02:53:10.640 --> 02:53:12.550 align:start position:0%
and this is a yes or no
answer

02:53:12.550 --> 02:53:12.560 align:start position:0%
answer
 
02:53:15.510 --> 02:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
do all ingredients
 
02:53:18.150 --> 02:53:18.160 align:start position:0%
have to be public
 
02:53:24.389 --> 02:53:24.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:27.349 --> 02:53:27.359 align:start position:0%
all ingredients are public
 
02:53:29.830 --> 02:53:29.840 align:start position:0%
so they have to be public to be
 
02:53:32.230 --> 02:53:32.240 align:start position:0%
approved fda okay
 
02:53:34.870 --> 02:53:34.880 align:start position:0%
so we need transparency on that and
 
02:53:37.110 --> 02:53:37.120 align:start position:0%
someone's saying that it is
 
02:53:38.389 --> 02:53:38.399 align:start position:0%
public so it
 
02:53:40.870 --> 02:53:40.880 align:start position:0%
confuses me how we are
 
02:53:45.110 --> 02:53:45.120 align:start position:0%
even questioning or voting on a mandate
 
02:53:47.349 --> 02:53:47.359 align:start position:0%
of a bio weapon
 
02:53:47.359 --> 02:53:48.230 align:start position:0%
of a bio weapon
so

02:53:48.230 --> 02:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:53:51.030 --> 02:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:52.950 --> 02:53:52.960 align:start position:0%
it is not a vaccine so let's be
 
02:53:55.590 --> 02:53:55.600 align:start position:0%
transparent let's be honest to all
 
02:53:58.469 --> 02:53:58.479 align:start position:0%
humanity please thank you
 
02:54:03.110 --> 02:54:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:05.349 --> 02:54:05.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i read that uh
 
02:54:07.349 --> 02:54:07.359 align:start position:0%
rosenwald's is on this committee i'd
 
02:54:09.190 --> 02:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
like to know if that's really true and
 
02:54:12.790 --> 02:54:12.800 align:start position:0%
if if she is why she's absent today and
 
02:54:12.800 --> 02:54:13.910 align:start position:0%
if if she is why she's absent today and
monday

02:54:13.910 --> 02:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
monday
 
02:54:15.590 --> 02:54:15.600 align:start position:0%
i can't speak to why members did not
 
02:54:17.349 --> 02:54:17.359 align:start position:0%
choose to attend the meeting i have no
 
02:54:19.830 --> 02:54:19.840 align:start position:0%
idea i believe she's traveling but i'm
 
02:54:21.429 --> 02:54:21.439 align:start position:0%
not positive
 
02:54:23.349 --> 02:54:23.359 align:start position:0%
so committee members are not required to
 
02:54:25.269 --> 02:54:25.279 align:start position:0%
be at events like this community members
 
02:54:27.590 --> 02:54:27.600 align:start position:0%
are appointed meetings are
 
02:54:28.950 --> 02:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
are public and they're supposed to
 
02:54:30.550 --> 02:54:30.560 align:start position:0%
attend it's all i can tell you okay
 
02:54:33.110 --> 02:54:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:36.550 --> 02:54:36.560 align:start position:0%
representative horgan oh thank you um
 
02:54:38.710 --> 02:54:38.720 align:start position:0%
first of all uh it's not uncommon
 
02:54:40.630 --> 02:54:40.640 align:start position:0%
especially for senators there's 24 of
 
02:54:42.070 --> 02:54:42.080 align:start position:0%
them and there's many committees so
 
02:54:43.830 --> 02:54:43.840 align:start position:0%
they're they're quite often not all of
 
02:54:46.870 --> 02:54:46.880 align:start position:0%
them are here so that's
 
02:54:48.710 --> 02:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
and also they're talking about the
 
02:54:51.429 --> 02:54:51.439 align:start position:0%
digitization my understanding is i might
 
02:54:53.269 --> 02:54:53.279 align:start position:0%
confuse the question if you prefer but i
 
02:54:55.750 --> 02:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
think my understanding is that
 
02:54:57.830 --> 02:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
in eventually everything that's
 
02:54:59.190 --> 02:54:59.200 align:start position:0%
submitted to every community gets
 
02:55:01.510 --> 02:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
digitized but there's a huge backlog so
 
02:55:03.750 --> 02:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
it um hopefully you'll be digitized
 
02:55:05.990 --> 02:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
right away but um we can't really count
 
02:55:08.790 --> 02:55:08.800 align:start position:0%
on it and my question was well i brought
 
02:55:10.710 --> 02:55:10.720 align:start position:0%
you the question why don't you mention
 
02:55:13.670 --> 02:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
we were talking about some number 7000
 
02:55:16.790 --> 02:55:16.800 align:start position:0%
from the cdc which you updated to 15
 
02:55:18.870 --> 02:55:18.880 align:start position:0%
100 which i guess is still two percent
 
02:55:20.469 --> 02:55:20.479 align:start position:0%
of what i the
 
02:55:22.469 --> 02:55:22.479 align:start position:0%
total number of reported covet deaths is
 
02:55:22.479 --> 02:55:24.150 align:start position:0%
total number of reported covet deaths is
but

02:55:24.150 --> 02:55:24.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:55:25.910 --> 02:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
i want to clarify at some point i don't
 
02:55:27.830 --> 02:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
know where you can do it now exactly
 
02:55:30.550 --> 02:55:30.560 align:start position:0%
which what that number was and where i
 
02:55:32.790 --> 02:55:32.800 align:start position:0%
can find it in the cdc reports i made an
 
02:55:32.800 --> 02:55:33.750 align:start position:0%
can find it in the cdc reports i made an
effort

02:55:33.750 --> 02:55:33.760 align:start position:0%
effort
 
02:55:35.590 --> 02:55:35.600 align:start position:0%
looking at my phone to find it and i
 
02:55:37.910 --> 02:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
didn't know where to look for it so just
 
02:55:39.269 --> 02:55:39.279 align:start position:0%
and that's probably something you should
 
02:55:41.670 --> 02:55:41.680 align:start position:0%
many things you should put in the report
 
02:55:41.680 --> 02:55:42.389 align:start position:0%
many things you should put in the report
so

02:55:42.389 --> 02:55:42.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:55:45.349 --> 02:55:45.359 align:start position:0%
which comes out of december 1st
 
02:55:47.030 --> 02:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
so they they answer your question the
 
02:55:49.429 --> 02:55:49.439 align:start position:0%
data comes directly from the cdc website
 
02:55:51.110 --> 02:55:51.120 align:start position:0%
from their their cumulative death
 
02:55:51.120 --> 02:55:53.030 align:start position:0%
from their their cumulative death
certificate

02:55:53.030 --> 02:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
certificate
 
02:55:54.950 --> 02:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
numbers and if you look at that it
 
02:55:56.550 --> 02:55:56.560 align:start position:0%
breaks it down by state new hampshire
 
02:55:58.950 --> 02:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
they reported 33 of those deaths that
 
02:56:03.110 --> 02:56:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:04.630 --> 02:56:04.640 align:start position:0%
self-afflicted injury injury or
 
02:56:06.389 --> 02:56:06.399 align:start position:0%
poisonings were actually 33 of the
 
02:56:08.230 --> 02:56:08.240 align:start position:0%
deaths in new hampshire reported under
 
02:56:09.830 --> 02:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
that category
 
02:56:11.750 --> 02:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
so that's a direct cdc statistical
 
02:56:13.190 --> 02:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
number that you can look at and you want
 
02:56:15.110 --> 02:56:15.120 align:start position:0%
to look at the um
 
02:56:16.790 --> 02:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
conditions and the secretary of state's
 
02:56:18.790 --> 02:56:18.800 align:start position:0%
office also has like a
 
02:56:21.030 --> 02:56:21.040 align:start position:0%
the call the divide vital records
 
02:56:23.030 --> 02:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
database which probably shows something
 
02:56:24.950 --> 02:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
similar and
 
02:56:27.110 --> 02:56:27.120 align:start position:0%
oh one more question um
 
02:56:28.150 --> 02:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
so the
 
02:56:30.710 --> 02:56:30.720 align:start position:0%
hb 220 i guess does um give you the
 
02:56:32.870 --> 02:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
chance to introduce legislation after
 
02:56:34.710 --> 02:56:34.720 align:start position:0%
the hearing and the report are done do
 
02:56:36.309 --> 02:56:36.319 align:start position:0%
you have any intention of introducing
 
02:56:38.469 --> 02:56:38.479 align:start position:0%
more legislation or you don't or is that
 
02:56:38.479 --> 02:56:39.590 align:start position:0%
more legislation or you don't or is that
something

02:56:39.590 --> 02:56:39.600 align:start position:0%
something
 
02:56:41.349 --> 02:56:41.359 align:start position:0%
so as a study committee the committee
 
02:56:44.230 --> 02:56:44.240 align:start position:0%
has the availability to um
 
02:56:46.469 --> 02:56:46.479 align:start position:0%
request late drafting and and it's
 
02:56:48.309 --> 02:56:48.319 align:start position:0%
routinely granted for late drafting of
 
02:56:50.550 --> 02:56:50.560 align:start position:0%
bills but again as i spoke before we
 
02:56:52.630 --> 02:56:52.640 align:start position:0%
have 32 bills on the on the various
 
02:56:54.950 --> 02:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
topics we'd probably be more inclined to
 
02:56:56.630 --> 02:56:56.640 align:start position:0%
recommend an amendment to an existing
 
02:56:59.349 --> 02:56:59.359 align:start position:0%
bill to cover any of the um
 
02:57:01.590 --> 02:57:01.600 align:start position:0%
at least i'm speaking for myself i'd be
 
02:57:03.030 --> 02:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
more inclined to
 
02:57:04.630 --> 02:57:04.640 align:start position:0%
recommend amendments to the bills that
 
02:57:06.150 --> 02:57:06.160 align:start position:0%
are going in if we think there's a topic
 
02:57:07.590 --> 02:57:07.600 align:start position:0%
that's come out of this committee that
 
02:57:07.600 --> 02:57:08.469 align:start position:0%
that's come out of this committee that
needs

02:57:08.469 --> 02:57:08.479 align:start position:0%
needs
 
02:57:11.190 --> 02:57:11.200 align:start position:0%
uh action and we we repurpose one of the
 
02:57:12.630 --> 02:57:12.640 align:start position:0%
existing bills or add on to one of the
 
02:57:14.630 --> 02:57:14.640 align:start position:0%
existing bills yeah good idea given
 
02:57:16.710 --> 02:57:16.720 align:start position:0%
there's addition of those 32 bills
 
02:57:18.110 --> 02:57:18.120 align:start position:0%
there's i think
 
02:57:21.290 --> 02:57:21.300 align:start position:0%
842 other bills i think there's 77
 
02:57:21.300 --> 02:57:22.950 align:start position:0%
842 other bills i think there's 77
[Music]

02:57:22.950 --> 02:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:57:24.150 --> 02:57:24.160 align:start position:0%
bills if i'm not mistaken all right
 
02:57:26.150 --> 02:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you
 
02:57:27.830 --> 02:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
further questions for the committee yes
 
02:57:27.840 --> 02:57:28.950 align:start position:0%
further questions for the committee yes
one

02:57:28.950 --> 02:57:28.960 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:57:31.510 --> 02:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
real quick comment um
 
02:57:33.269 --> 02:57:33.279 align:start position:0%
we hear a lot we've heard a lot this
 
02:57:35.429 --> 02:57:35.439 align:start position:0%
morning about medical exemptions this
 
02:57:37.910 --> 02:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
right here is our exemption
 
02:57:40.230 --> 02:57:40.240 align:start position:0%
under the constitution which all swore
 
02:57:41.590 --> 02:57:41.600 align:start position:0%
to uphold
 
02:57:42.790 --> 02:57:42.800 align:start position:0%
we the people
 
02:57:43.830 --> 02:57:43.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:57:48.469 --> 02:57:48.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:50.710 --> 02:57:50.720 align:start position:0%
hi um thank you for taking questions
 
02:57:52.630 --> 02:57:52.640 align:start position:0%
this is so refreshing compared to school
 
02:57:53.830 --> 02:57:53.840 align:start position:0%
board meetings
 
02:57:53.840 --> 02:57:54.870 align:start position:0%
board meetings
um

02:57:54.870 --> 02:57:54.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:57:57.030 --> 02:57:57.040 align:start position:0%
i have a question i don't have a copy of
 
02:57:58.710 --> 02:57:58.720 align:start position:0%
the bill in front of me but i'm gonna
 
02:58:00.150 --> 02:58:00.160 align:start position:0%
reference was stuck in my head when
 
02:58:01.830 --> 02:58:01.840 align:start position:0%
another speaker spoke
 
02:58:04.550 --> 02:58:04.560 align:start position:0%
um that the bill is in reference to
 
02:58:08.389 --> 02:58:08.399 align:start position:0%
immunizations and medical interventions
 
02:58:10.230 --> 02:58:10.240 align:start position:0%
would a medical intervention include the
 
02:58:12.309 --> 02:58:12.319 align:start position:0%
masking because it's being used as a
 
02:58:14.469 --> 02:58:14.479 align:start position:0%
medical device and give us back our
 
02:58:16.630 --> 02:58:16.640 align:start position:0%
rights over our children's to use or not
 
02:58:16.640 --> 02:58:17.429 align:start position:0%
rights over our children's to use or not
use

02:58:17.429 --> 02:58:17.439 align:start position:0%
use
 
02:58:20.389 --> 02:58:20.399 align:start position:0%
a medical device in schools
 
02:58:22.870 --> 02:58:22.880 align:start position:0%
being forced i'm going to pass this over
 
02:58:24.950 --> 02:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
to erica uh representative leigh and i
 
02:58:26.870 --> 02:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
think we had we had a definition in one
 
02:58:28.630 --> 02:58:28.640 align:start position:0%
of the here one of the meetings they
 
02:58:30.070 --> 02:58:30.080 align:start position:0%
talked about what medical intervention
 
02:58:31.269 --> 02:58:31.279 align:start position:0%
was and talk about treatment and
 
02:58:33.349 --> 02:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
procedures and i'm trying i don't recall
 
02:58:34.710 --> 02:58:34.720 align:start position:0%
the exact language i used i'm hoping
 
02:58:36.870 --> 02:58:36.880 align:start position:0%
maybe she remembers
 
02:58:38.710 --> 02:58:38.720 align:start position:0%
there are many definitions of medical
 
02:58:41.269 --> 02:58:41.279 align:start position:0%
interventions um there's more of a focus
 
02:58:43.110 --> 02:58:43.120 align:start position:0%
on those that are invasive so they cross
 
02:58:45.030 --> 02:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
the body barrier so whether it's an
 
02:58:47.510 --> 02:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
injection whether it's a blood blood
 
02:58:49.110 --> 02:58:49.120 align:start position:0%
draw whether it's something that goes
 
02:58:51.030 --> 02:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
through a natural orifice
 
02:58:54.070 --> 02:58:54.080 align:start position:0%
because it's a hard thing to define and
 
02:58:56.150 --> 02:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
you have to draw a line at some point
 
02:58:56.160 --> 02:58:57.590 align:start position:0%
you have to draw a line at some point
and

02:58:57.590 --> 02:58:57.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:58:58.870 --> 02:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
at this point there is a difference
 
02:59:00.389 --> 02:59:00.399 align:start position:0%
between something you can take off and
 
02:59:02.630 --> 02:59:02.640 align:start position:0%
something that you can't
 
02:59:04.309 --> 02:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
so is there anything
 
02:59:06.389 --> 02:59:06.399 align:start position:0%
then coming down the pipeline to help
 
02:59:07.750 --> 02:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
parents to get
 
02:59:10.550 --> 02:59:10.560 align:start position:0%
that gain back control over our medical
 
02:59:12.630 --> 02:59:12.640 align:start position:0%
decisions because right now the schools
 
02:59:14.630 --> 02:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
are making medical decisions for our
 
02:59:16.710 --> 02:59:16.720 align:start position:0%
children that many of us don't agree
 
02:59:16.720 --> 02:59:17.750 align:start position:0%
children that many of us don't agree
with

02:59:17.750 --> 02:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:59:19.030 --> 02:59:19.040 align:start position:0%
there are several bills that have been
 
02:59:20.630 --> 02:59:20.640 align:start position:0%
filed for that
 
02:59:22.710 --> 02:59:22.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:59:34.230 --> 02:59:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:36.070 --> 02:59:36.080 align:start position:0%
that the constitution is the highest law
 
02:59:37.429 --> 02:59:37.439 align:start position:0%
in the land
 
02:59:40.550 --> 02:59:40.560 align:start position:0%
and that our rights are unalienable and
 
02:59:45.030 --> 02:59:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:47.110 --> 02:59:47.120 align:start position:0%
they've given them up perhaps by not
 
02:59:49.269 --> 02:59:49.279 align:start position:0%
knowing that they can't lose them and
 
02:59:50.590 --> 02:59:50.600 align:start position:0%
that the rights are being
 
02:59:53.190 --> 02:59:53.200 align:start position:0%
unconstitutionally violated and taken
 
02:59:54.469 --> 02:59:54.479 align:start position:0%
from them they have not lost their
 
02:59:58.230 --> 02:59:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:59.429 --> 02:59:59.439 align:start position:0%
i i don't know how to answer your
 
03:00:01.190 --> 03:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
question ma'am i'm sorry i don't know
 
03:00:03.110 --> 03:00:03.120 align:start position:0%
how to answer your question so the
 
03:00:04.150 --> 03:00:04.160 align:start position:0%
question is
 
03:00:05.429 --> 03:00:05.439 align:start position:0%
that's probably the best answer i get i
 
03:00:07.269 --> 03:00:07.279 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer to your question
 
03:00:09.269 --> 03:00:09.279 align:start position:0%
well it would be good a really good
 
03:00:11.670 --> 03:00:11.680 align:start position:0%
thing to look into because i know the
 
03:00:13.990 --> 03:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
answer to the question well i can
 
03:00:15.110 --> 03:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
probably tell you that the federal
 
03:00:17.030 --> 03:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
lawsuit that's currently pending
 
03:00:19.030 --> 03:00:19.040 align:start position:0%
asks that one of those exact questions
 
03:00:20.550 --> 03:00:20.560 align:start position:0%
whether or not it's a fundamental rights
 
03:00:22.630 --> 03:00:22.640 align:start position:0%
issue to begin with
 
03:00:24.870 --> 03:00:24.880 align:start position:0%
the constitution means what it says
 
03:00:26.950 --> 03:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
and we have not lost our rights okay
 
03:00:30.630 --> 03:00:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:32.710 --> 03:00:32.720 align:start position:0%
i just wondered how many members are on
 
03:00:34.550 --> 03:00:34.560 align:start position:0%
this committee i see one two three
 
03:00:36.790 --> 03:00:36.800 align:start position:0%
there's six is currently senator
 
03:00:38.230 --> 03:00:38.240 align:start position:0%
rosenwald is the only one that's missing
 
03:00:40.950 --> 03:00:40.960 align:start position:0%
okay all right thank you
 
03:00:45.910 --> 03:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:49.429 --> 03:00:49.439 align:start position:0%
so i have a child who is in her 30s
 
03:00:52.469 --> 03:00:52.479 align:start position:0%
works at concord hospital
 
03:00:52.479 --> 03:00:53.990 align:start position:0%
works at concord hospital
she

03:00:53.990 --> 03:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
she
 
03:00:56.550 --> 03:00:56.560 align:start position:0%
like me has co-morbidities
 
03:00:59.269 --> 03:00:59.279 align:start position:0%
i will not be getting this shot
 
03:01:01.349 --> 03:01:01.359 align:start position:0%
and i have my own personal reasons for
 
03:01:03.910 --> 03:01:03.920 align:start position:0%
it and the constitution supports me in
 
03:01:07.990 --> 03:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:10.230 --> 03:01:10.240 align:start position:0%
luckily i'm a housewife
 
03:01:14.550 --> 03:01:14.560 align:start position:0%
so i'm not being mandated by my employer
 
03:01:16.550 --> 03:01:16.560 align:start position:0%
or the state
 
03:01:16.560 --> 03:01:17.510 align:start position:0%
or the state
but

03:01:17.510 --> 03:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:01:19.510 --> 03:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
my child who
 
03:01:22.469 --> 03:01:22.479 align:start position:0%
works at concord hospital
 
03:01:24.870 --> 03:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
was told by a certainty she had to
 
03:01:24.880 --> 03:01:27.190 align:start position:0%
was told by a certainty she had to
submit

03:01:27.190 --> 03:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
submit
 
03:01:29.990 --> 03:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
an exemption or a you know something to
 
03:01:31.990 --> 03:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
let them make the decision for her about
 
03:01:35.830 --> 03:01:35.840 align:start position:0%
whether she was going to do this thing
 
03:01:38.550 --> 03:01:38.560 align:start position:0%
medically she has comorbidities she
 
03:01:42.309 --> 03:01:42.319 align:start position:0%
literally has half organs because i am
 
03:01:45.110 --> 03:01:45.120 align:start position:0%
a type 1 diabetic and one of the things
 
03:01:47.830 --> 03:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
that i passed on to my child
 
03:01:50.309 --> 03:01:50.319 align:start position:0%
is the fact that she doesn't have all of
 
03:01:51.750 --> 03:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
her organs
 
03:01:51.760 --> 03:01:53.190 align:start position:0%
her organs
so

03:01:53.190 --> 03:01:53.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:01:54.469 --> 03:01:54.479 align:start position:0%
she had to
 
03:01:57.190 --> 03:01:57.200 align:start position:0%
submit a medical exemption but she went
 
03:01:59.429 --> 03:01:59.439 align:start position:0%
to her primary
 
03:02:01.510 --> 03:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
in franklin
 
03:02:01.520 --> 03:02:02.870 align:start position:0%
in franklin
and

03:02:02.870 --> 03:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:02:05.910 --> 03:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
this doctor literally told her i cannot
 
03:02:08.070 --> 03:02:08.080 align:start position:0%
write you a medical exemption or i will
 
03:02:10.710 --> 03:02:10.720 align:start position:0%
lose my physician capability
 
03:02:12.630 --> 03:02:12.640 align:start position:0%
i cannot do it
 
03:02:15.830 --> 03:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
my over the people above the doctor are
 
03:02:18.950 --> 03:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
telling her she can't have her job or
 
03:02:20.710 --> 03:02:20.720 align:start position:0%
take care of her patients
 
03:02:22.950 --> 03:02:22.960 align:start position:0%
if she writes my daughter
 
03:02:25.349 --> 03:02:25.359 align:start position:0%
a reason to not medically get out of
 
03:02:29.110 --> 03:02:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:31.190 --> 03:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
wrong so wrong
 
03:02:31.200 --> 03:02:33.349 align:start position:0%
wrong so wrong
but

03:02:33.349 --> 03:02:33.359 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:02:35.910 --> 03:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
so she decides since she's gone to the
 
03:02:38.790 --> 03:02:38.800 align:start position:0%
doctor paid for a visit had her primary
 
03:02:40.710 --> 03:02:40.720 align:start position:0%
and her have a full conversation where
 
03:02:42.790 --> 03:02:42.800 align:start position:0%
the doctor is literally apologizing to
 
03:02:45.269 --> 03:02:45.279 align:start position:0%
her that she can't do what she knows she
 
03:02:46.790 --> 03:02:46.800 align:start position:0%
should do
 
03:02:49.670 --> 03:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
because if she does it she's got no job
 
03:02:51.830 --> 03:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
so my daughter walks out calls me after
 
03:02:53.510 --> 03:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
and was like mom
 
03:02:55.349 --> 03:02:55.359 align:start position:0%
she can't write me one what are you
 
03:02:56.870 --> 03:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
talking about you have
 
03:03:00.870 --> 03:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
half your organs she knows it's not safe
 
03:03:03.110 --> 03:03:03.120 align:start position:0%
yeah my only other option is to do the
 
03:03:04.790 --> 03:03:04.800 align:start position:0%
religious exemption
 
03:03:07.910 --> 03:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
we are christian family we attend church
 
03:03:11.110 --> 03:03:11.120 align:start position:0%
we have our beliefs from the bible so i
 
03:03:13.190 --> 03:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
tell her well go ahead and try to submit
 
03:03:16.070 --> 03:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
it she ends up leaving the hospital
 
03:03:18.469 --> 03:03:18.479 align:start position:0%
because she's so afraid that on that day
 
03:03:20.550 --> 03:03:20.560 align:start position:0%
that they're going to make her do it
 
03:03:22.630 --> 03:03:22.640 align:start position:0%
then she looks for other work and i'm
 
03:03:24.710 --> 03:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
telling her hold on
 
03:03:27.429 --> 03:03:27.439 align:start position:0%
hold on because maybe this will all
 
03:03:31.349 --> 03:03:31.359 align:start position:0%
change before that date comes right
 
03:03:33.190 --> 03:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
so she submits for the religious
 
03:03:33.200 --> 03:03:34.710 align:start position:0%
so she submits for the religious
exemption

03:03:34.710 --> 03:03:34.720 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
03:03:36.950 --> 03:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
she leaves the hospital
 
03:03:39.349 --> 03:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
luckily she had many opportunities
 
03:03:41.510 --> 03:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
because she's a very good candidate in
 
03:03:44.469 --> 03:03:44.479 align:start position:0%
her field to find other work
 
03:03:46.309 --> 03:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
she found other work
 
03:03:49.190 --> 03:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
that didn't require this to come down on
 
03:03:49.200 --> 03:03:50.710 align:start position:0%
that didn't require this to come down on
her

03:03:50.710 --> 03:03:50.720 align:start position:0%
her
 
03:03:54.309 --> 03:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
she leaves her job that she loved and
 
03:03:56.710 --> 03:03:56.720 align:start position:0%
she goes to this other job
 
03:03:58.550 --> 03:03:58.560 align:start position:0%
she's working it for a little while and
 
03:04:01.349 --> 03:04:01.359 align:start position:0%
she gets the notification weeks later
 
03:04:03.190 --> 03:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
that they've accepted her religious
 
03:04:03.200 --> 03:04:04.309 align:start position:0%
that they've accepted her religious
exemption

03:04:04.309 --> 03:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
03:04:06.790 --> 03:04:06.800 align:start position:0%
oh well that first of all shouldn't have
 
03:04:08.150 --> 03:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
been something she should have had to
 
03:04:10.309 --> 03:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
submit in the first place because that
 
03:04:13.110 --> 03:04:13.120 align:start position:0%
is an individual choice as well
 
03:04:15.190 --> 03:04:15.200 align:start position:0%
i will tell you another thing that my
 
03:04:17.510 --> 03:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
son attends the same district that you
 
03:04:20.309 --> 03:04:20.319 align:start position:0%
live in and this morning i had to call
 
03:04:22.389 --> 03:04:22.399 align:start position:0%
the principal of the winter squam middle
 
03:04:25.349 --> 03:04:25.359 align:start position:0%
school and tell them my son will not be
 
03:04:27.510 --> 03:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
attending school and that they had
 
03:04:30.150 --> 03:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
better get him an education that is
 
03:04:33.030 --> 03:04:33.040 align:start position:0%
adequate even though i'll be keeping him
 
03:04:35.429 --> 03:04:35.439 align:start position:0%
home because he's not wearing a mask
 
03:04:37.510 --> 03:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
because my son who will not be getting
 
03:04:41.590 --> 03:04:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:44.309 --> 03:04:44.319 align:start position:0%
had heart surgery at boston children's
 
03:04:47.830 --> 03:04:47.840 align:start position:0%
at five days old i am not putting this
 
03:04:49.429 --> 03:04:49.439 align:start position:0%
bio weapon
 
03:04:52.309 --> 03:04:52.319 align:start position:0%
which we don't know what it does other
 
03:04:54.710 --> 03:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
than the myocarditis which is
 
03:04:54.720 --> 03:04:56.150 align:start position:0%
than the myocarditis which is
hugely

03:04:56.150 --> 03:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
hugely
 
03:04:57.590 --> 03:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
fearful for me
 
03:04:59.670 --> 03:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
i've talked to my doctor about every
 
03:05:03.030 --> 03:05:03.040 align:start position:0%
vaccine that my family has had raising
 
03:05:06.309 --> 03:05:06.319 align:start position:0%
my daughter and raising my son i am not
 
03:05:10.070 --> 03:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
an anti-vaxxer i've had all my vaccines
 
03:05:12.630 --> 03:05:12.640 align:start position:0%
my son has attended public school he's
 
03:05:15.110 --> 03:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
had all his vaccines that are mandated
 
03:05:16.790 --> 03:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
for him to attack
 
03:05:18.870 --> 03:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
from now on
 
03:05:22.070 --> 03:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
he will be religiously exempting
 
03:05:25.030 --> 03:05:25.040 align:start position:0%
out of any future vaccines from this
 
03:05:27.190 --> 03:05:27.200 align:start position:0%
country that says that he should have
 
03:05:27.200 --> 03:05:28.150 align:start position:0%
country that says that he should have
one

03:05:28.150 --> 03:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
one
 
03:05:31.110 --> 03:05:31.120 align:start position:0%
to attend school to attend anything
 
03:05:32.870 --> 03:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
and i'm telling you that you guys need
 
03:05:36.070 --> 03:05:36.080 align:start position:0%
to listen to your constituents all of
 
03:05:39.190 --> 03:05:39.200 align:start position:0%
them not just the ones that are fearful
 
03:05:42.309 --> 03:05:42.319 align:start position:0%
i'm fearful too but i had covet
 
03:05:44.630 --> 03:05:44.640 align:start position:0%
i'm immune my child who worked at the
 
03:05:47.190 --> 03:05:47.200 align:start position:0%
hospital had covered had to prove she
 
03:05:49.670 --> 03:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
didn't that she was healthy and had the
 
03:05:51.590 --> 03:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
strength to go back to work at that
 
03:05:51.600 --> 03:05:53.110 align:start position:0%
strength to go back to work at that
hospital

03:05:53.110 --> 03:05:53.120 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
03:05:55.349 --> 03:05:55.359 align:start position:0%
and they still didn't take
 
03:05:57.910 --> 03:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
anything but a religious exemption
 
03:06:00.070 --> 03:06:00.080 align:start position:0%
as her reason for being now she's back
 
03:06:02.070 --> 03:06:02.080 align:start position:0%
to work that she went back to the
 
03:06:04.070 --> 03:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
hospital after all of that
 
03:06:06.710 --> 03:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
they accepted her back gladly because
 
03:06:08.950 --> 03:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
she was a good employee
 
03:06:11.110 --> 03:06:11.120 align:start position:0%
i just you guys have got to look to
 
03:06:13.830 --> 03:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
everybody for there's reasons people
 
03:06:16.150 --> 03:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
don't do these things and you don't i
 
03:06:17.910 --> 03:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't take a vaccine if it was going
 
03:06:19.349 --> 03:06:19.359 align:start position:0%
to mean that it was going to react
 
03:06:21.590 --> 03:06:21.600 align:start position:0%
differently with my insulin because that
 
03:06:23.750 --> 03:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
insulin keeps me alive
 
03:06:26.070 --> 03:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
if i didn't have it in my body right now
 
03:06:30.150 --> 03:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
i'd be dead right
 
03:06:32.950 --> 03:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
you guys can't just
 
03:06:34.070 --> 03:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
look at
 
03:06:36.550 --> 03:06:36.560 align:start position:0%
one thing and think it's not okay if i
 
03:06:38.950 --> 03:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
was an employed person and i chose to
 
03:06:41.830 --> 03:06:41.840 align:start position:0%
not get it i i lose my house i lose
 
03:06:45.670 --> 03:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:47.910 --> 03:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
it's not okay
 
03:06:49.429 --> 03:06:49.439 align:start position:0%
just okay
 
03:06:51.670 --> 03:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i got emotional but thank you
 
03:06:52.950 --> 03:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
03:06:55.590 --> 03:06:55.600 align:start position:0%
for your comment question so a real
 
03:06:58.550 --> 03:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
question yes sir okay this time do you
 
03:06:59.910 --> 03:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
guys have any idea who's going to be
 
03:07:02.070 --> 03:07:02.080 align:start position:0%
held liable eventually when in a few
 
03:07:04.950 --> 03:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
years inevitably um we have kids or
 
03:07:07.510 --> 03:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
adults as well who have some mild to
 
03:07:09.670 --> 03:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
moderate brain or other injuries from
 
03:07:12.070 --> 03:07:12.080 align:start position:0%
chronic hypoxia which is low oxygen and
 
03:07:14.309 --> 03:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
chronic hypercapnia which is high co2
 
03:07:16.070 --> 03:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
there have been some studies of uh
 
03:07:18.070 --> 03:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
chronic hypoxia in regards to copd and
 
03:07:20.389 --> 03:07:20.399 align:start position:0%
overall it could uh increase hemoglobin
 
03:07:21.750 --> 03:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
as well which can cause more clots but
 
03:07:21.760 --> 03:07:22.710 align:start position:0%
as well which can cause more clots but
also

03:07:22.710 --> 03:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
also
 
03:07:24.469 --> 03:07:24.479 align:start position:0%
overall if your oxygen saturation is a
 
03:07:26.469 --> 03:07:26.479 align:start position:0%
little low not dying but if it's a
 
03:07:30.150 --> 03:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
little like 90 95 90 85 you get some
 
03:07:31.670 --> 03:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
brain fog and anxiety and eventually
 
03:07:33.830 --> 03:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
some memory loss and from this two year
 
03:07:36.870 --> 03:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
long experiment of wearing masks 24 7
 
03:07:38.790 --> 03:07:38.800 align:start position:0%
and uh same with high co2 can also cause
 
03:07:40.309 --> 03:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
a little bit of brain damage not like
 
03:07:42.710 --> 03:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
super severe mr or whatever but it can
 
03:07:45.750 --> 03:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
cause some memory loss anxiety some slow
 
03:07:47.670 --> 03:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
reflexes and overall a little bit of
 
03:07:49.429 --> 03:07:49.439 align:start position:0%
brain damage in a few years i'm afraid
 
03:07:50.790 --> 03:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to see some of that because
 
03:07:53.269 --> 03:07:53.279 align:start position:0%
not me but somewhere masks 24 7. and it
 
03:07:55.750 --> 03:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely does decrease oxygen and 3
 
03:07:57.349 --> 03:07:57.359 align:start position:0%
co2 you know who's going to be liable
 
03:07:58.469 --> 03:07:58.479 align:start position:0%
will you be able to sue the government
 
03:08:00.550 --> 03:08:00.560 align:start position:0%
for mandating and coercing us to take
 
03:08:02.550 --> 03:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
you know put on masks or the school
 
03:08:04.309 --> 03:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
boards or businesses you force masks so
 
03:08:05.429 --> 03:08:05.439 align:start position:0%
that's my first question i'd love an
 
03:08:07.269 --> 03:08:07.279 align:start position:0%
answer and the second one is is someone
 
03:08:08.389 --> 03:08:08.399 align:start position:0%
mentioned that doctors are losing
 
03:08:10.309 --> 03:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
licenses and you know some doctors
 
03:08:11.429 --> 03:08:11.439 align:start position:0%
throughout the united states because of
 
03:08:13.429 --> 03:08:13.439 align:start position:0%
the ama and all the board certifications
 
03:08:14.870 --> 03:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
for attendings for different specialties
 
03:08:17.429 --> 03:08:17.439 align:start position:0%
are revoking the uh board certifications
 
03:08:19.510 --> 03:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
for doctors who don't speak highly
 
03:08:21.590 --> 03:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
positively of the vaccine or who oppose
 
03:08:23.590 --> 03:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
coronary fascism as a paramedic without
 
03:08:25.670 --> 03:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
my paramedic card i can't earn money um
 
03:08:27.590 --> 03:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
you know from being a medic do you do
 
03:08:29.429 --> 03:08:29.439 align:start position:0%
you guys plan as state reps or other
 
03:08:31.349 --> 03:08:31.359 align:start position:0%
state reps to revoke my license if i
 
03:08:32.710 --> 03:08:32.720 align:start position:0%
don't endorse the vaccine or endorse
 
03:08:34.469 --> 03:08:34.479 align:start position:0%
chronic fascism and that would take my
 
03:08:36.070 --> 03:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
livelihood and that would be another
 
03:08:37.349 --> 03:08:37.359 align:start position:0%
question i would love to answer for
 
03:08:37.359 --> 03:08:38.150 align:start position:0%
question i would love to answer for
thanks

03:08:38.150 --> 03:08:38.160 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
03:08:39.990 --> 03:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
sure so answer your two questions the
 
03:08:41.750 --> 03:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
first one being is there several bills
 
03:08:44.150 --> 03:08:44.160 align:start position:0%
submitted relative to liability uh on
 
03:08:45.830 --> 03:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
covet and whether there's business
 
03:08:47.429 --> 03:08:47.439 align:start position:0%
liability whether it's governmental
 
03:08:49.110 --> 03:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
liability or whether there's individual
 
03:08:50.710 --> 03:08:50.720 align:start position:0%
liability and where that i think there's
 
03:08:53.349 --> 03:08:53.359 align:start position:0%
at least three bills on on um liability
 
03:08:55.590 --> 03:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
as it relates to exposure to covid or
 
03:08:57.590 --> 03:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
expo or the mandates that have been
 
03:08:58.790 --> 03:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
pushed down
 
03:09:01.190 --> 03:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
secondarily to answer your your second
 
03:09:04.070 --> 03:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:05.670 --> 03:09:05.680 align:start position:0%
on the licensure so
 
03:09:08.309 --> 03:09:08.319 align:start position:0%
um there's no bill somewhere that talk
 
03:09:10.550 --> 03:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
about licensure for doctors relative to
 
03:09:13.269 --> 03:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
being suspended so that would be a
 
03:09:15.670 --> 03:09:15.680 align:start position:0%
policy or regulation that's dealt with
 
03:09:18.309 --> 03:09:18.319 align:start position:0%
in the board of medicine um on their
 
03:09:21.269 --> 03:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
regulatory requirements for um licensure
 
03:09:22.950 --> 03:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
so but there are no currently no bills
 
03:09:25.510 --> 03:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
to address that that i'm aware
 
03:09:26.950 --> 03:09:26.960 align:start position:0%
all right that being done we're going to
 
03:09:28.469 --> 03:09:28.479 align:start position:0%
go into recess
 
03:09:30.229 --> 03:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
real quick uh but before the committee
 
03:09:32.229 --> 03:09:32.239 align:start position:0%
members leave i guess i we're gonna meet
 
03:09:34.469 --> 03:09:34.479 align:start position:0%
in in state house 103
 
03:09:36.550 --> 03:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
uh how long do we want to take a break
 
03:09:40.469 --> 03:09:40.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:43.110 --> 03:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
i'm hoping we can have a good committee
 
03:09:45.269 --> 03:09:45.279 align:start position:0%
work session and not be very long at all
 
03:09:47.750 --> 03:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
i've i've worked up some draft language
 
03:09:49.190 --> 03:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
i'll get printed out and so each member
 
03:09:51.269 --> 03:09:51.279 align:start position:0%
has a copy of some draft language
 
03:09:53.429 --> 03:09:53.439 align:start position:0%
and we can talk about the draft language
 
03:09:54.630 --> 03:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
and see if there's anything that really
 
03:10:20.070 --> 03:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:21.910 --> 03:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
yep so we're going to meet in state
 
03:10:24.150 --> 03:10:24.160 align:start position:0%
house 103 we'll take a 15-minute break
 
03:10:26.150 --> 03:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
to give us file break use the restroom
 
03:10:27.910 --> 03:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing ten minutes ten
 
03:10:29.910 --> 03:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
minute break so we'll meet down there at
 
03:10:31.670 --> 03:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
12 10
 
03:10:33.590 --> 03:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
in state house room 103 where the
 
03:10:35.910 --> 03:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
committee will begin some deliberations
 
03:10:37.670 --> 03:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
and discussions around the committee
 
03:10:39.349 --> 03:10:39.359 align:start position:0%
report that'll be a result of this
 
03:14:41.670 --> 03:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:41.680 --> 03:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
you
