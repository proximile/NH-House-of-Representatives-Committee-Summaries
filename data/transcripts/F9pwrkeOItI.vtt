inexcusable threat to parents rights in

New Hampshire as I expect some members
 
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.160 align:start position:0%
of the committee already know parents
 
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 align:start position:0%
around the state have increasingly
 
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
reported that their children are being
 
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
given Medical treatment of various kinds

consent tweeted in secret or in the most
 
00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:42.639 align:start position:0%
truly bizarre cases tweeted contrary to
 
00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:44.759 align:start position:0%
a parent's expressed
 
00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 align:start position:0%
wishes in late 2022 the Nashville
 
00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 align:start position:0%
Department of Public Health administered
 
00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:52.639 align:start position:0%
the flu vaccine to a 7-year-old girl
 
00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 align:start position:0%
with no parental consent
 
00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
form when he was asked about this event
 
00:05:59.909 --> 00:05:59.919 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire state epidemiological Dr
 
00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:02.479 align:start position:0%
Benjamin Chan publicly described this
 
00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
incident as a never event a medical term
 
00:06:08.309 --> 00:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
for a breach so rare un severe that it
 
00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120 align:start position:0%
should never
 
00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
occur but it was not long before it
 
00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
happened again this time even more
 
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
egregiously in October of 22 the mother
 
00:06:20.309 --> 00:06:20.319 align:start position:0%
of a 5-year-old girl in Rochester was
 
00:06:23.309 --> 00:06:23.319 align:start position:0%
asked to sign off on her daughter's flu
 
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
vaccination instead the mother gave
 
00:06:27.589 --> 00:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
written notice to the school stating
 
00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:29.960 align:start position:0%
that her daughter quote will not not be
 
00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
getting this shot please I do not
 
00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
consent the school received the notice
 
00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:37.960 align:start position:0%
and vaccinated her daughter
 
00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:40.199 align:start position:0%
anyway I mentioned this case in
 
00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:42.080 align:start position:0%
particular because state representative
 
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
Jim kofalt personally reviewed the
 
00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
documents supporting this Mother's
 
00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:49.880 align:start position:0%
account in our legal system parents have
 
00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
always been understood to have a natural
 
00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:54.479 align:start position:0%
and constitutional right to direct the
 
00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
upbringing of their children limiting
 
00:06:59.710 --> 00:06:59.720 align:start position:0%
that right has always required some
 
00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:02.080 align:start position:0%
specific evidence that individual
 
00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
parents are failing in their
 
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
responsibilities yet these reports are
 
00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:09.560 align:start position:0%
only one part of a disturbing Trend
 
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
public institutions especially are
 
00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:14.120 align:start position:0%
increasingly infringing on parental
 
00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:16.520 align:start position:0%
rights by effectively declaring all
 
00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:19.000 align:start position:0%
parents guilty until proven
 
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:21.240 align:start position:0%
innocent parents rights are being
 
00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:23.360 align:start position:0%
steadily Stripped Away by default and
 
00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:25.720 align:start position:0%
usted to State
 
00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:28.120 align:start position:0%
institutions schools and other public
 
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
institutions May sometimes think that
 
00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
they are more trustworthy than many
 
00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:34.479 align:start position:0%
parents but state employees and
 
00:07:36.749 --> 00:07:36.759 align:start position:0%
officials are every bit as human as the
 
00:07:39.469 --> 00:07:39.479 align:start position:0%
most irresponsible parent and people
 
00:07:42.029 --> 00:07:42.039 align:start position:0%
with power if left unchecked have always
 
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
been able to do greater harm than people
 
00:07:47.469 --> 00:07:47.479 align:start position:0%
without this study committee will allow
 
00:07:49.589 --> 00:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
the legislature to examine if our
 
00:07:51.589 --> 00:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
current health care consent and
 
00:07:53.869 --> 00:07:53.879 align:start position:0%
confidentiality laws have failed to
 
00:07:57.149 --> 00:07:57.159 align:start position:0%
adequately protect parents rights thank
 
00:07:59.510 --> 00:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
you thank you Senator any question
 
00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:06.469 --> 00:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
senator Vice chairman
 
00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
long thank you Mr chairman uh thank you
 
00:08:13.869 --> 00:08:13.879 align:start position:0%
Senator uh the question I have is uh uh
 
00:08:15.869 --> 00:08:15.879 align:start position:0%
does this include mental and behavioral
 
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
health or is this just physical I I I
 
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
don't I as far as I know it's just the
 
00:08:23.629 --> 00:08:23.639 align:start position:0%
medical health and the kids in school
 
00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
are being treated without parents uh
 
00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:30.520 align:start position:0%
knowledge okay may mental health but I'm
 
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
not sure follow on in the ACT where it
 
00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
says laws applicable to Adolescent and
 
00:08:38.269 --> 00:08:38.279 align:start position:0%
young adult
 
00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:42.440 align:start position:0%
healthare young adult is the 18
 
00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:48.320 align:start position:0%
to um6 is the 18 right uh and I'm I'm
 
00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:51.200 align:start position:0%
wondering uh they they call their own
 
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
shots don't they with respect to their
 
00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
medical you talk about the definition of
 
00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:57.640 align:start position:0%
a young adult yeah uh I I'm not sure
 
00:09:00.509 --> 00:09:00.519 align:start position:0%
I've seen it up to 20 the age 26 but it
 
00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:05.360 align:start position:0%
may be too high okay thank
 
00:09:12.389 --> 00:09:12.399 align:start position:0%
you U while such a study committee could
 
00:09:15.829 --> 00:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
conceivably discover lapses in the
 
00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:19.800 align:start position:0%
system could it also be able to say that
 
00:09:23.389 --> 00:09:23.399 align:start position:0%
on ever so many occurrences the system
 
00:09:26.069 --> 00:09:26.079 align:start position:0%
is working well in other words there is
 
00:09:26.079 --> 00:09:27.190 align:start position:0%
is working well in other words there is
not

00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
necessarily uh a prejudice towards one
 
00:09:33.389 --> 00:09:33.399 align:start position:0%
conclusion or the other but let the
 
00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
discovery go where it might I would
 
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
certainly hope so because I think
 
00:09:38.949 --> 00:09:38.959 align:start position:0%
whenever you do a study you like to find
 
00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:41.720 align:start position:0%
out the plus and minuses and you have to
 
00:09:43.389 --> 00:09:43.399 align:start position:0%
look at both of them and see how they
 
00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
weigh at the end I appreciate follow
 
00:09:48.269 --> 00:09:48.279 align:start position:0%
followup I appreciate that because not
 
00:09:49.949 --> 00:09:49.959 align:start position:0%
all study committees come in with that
 
00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:51.560 align:start position:0%
motive thank
 
00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
you any other questions for the
 
00:09:59.509 --> 00:09:59.519 align:start position:0%
senator seeing none thank you sir so
 
00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:02.160 align:start position:0%

certain circumstance certain situations
 
00:29:56.389 --> 00:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
this bill make further establishes new
 
00:29:57.750 --> 00:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
classified positions within the
 
00:29:58.590 --> 00:29:58.600 align:start position:0%
department Department of Health and
 
00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:00.320 align:start position:0%
Human Services and makes an
 
00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:02.360 align:start position:0%
appropriation to the
 
00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
department why why do we have this bill
 
00:30:07.269 --> 00:30:07.279 align:start position:0%
and why do we need this bill well
 
00:30:09.509 --> 00:30:09.519 align:start position:0%
children are the central parties in
 
00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect cases I think all of
 
00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:14.240 align:start position:0%
you that sit on this committee are well
 
00:30:17.669 --> 00:30:17.679 align:start position:0%
aware of that um you've heard I I would
 
00:30:20.549 --> 00:30:20.559 align:start position:0%
imagine a lot of testimony about
 
00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
children and what happens to them when
 
00:30:25.789 --> 00:30:25.799 align:start position:0%
they uh when these cases come forward
 
00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:28.200 align:start position:0%
and I think we all know too that some of
 
00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's these are some of New
 
00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's most vulnerable children and
 
00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:34.840 align:start position:0%
the potential consequences that they
 
00:30:37.389 --> 00:30:37.399 align:start position:0%
face including the loss of their parents
 
00:30:40.029 --> 00:30:40.039 align:start position:0%
their homes and families are severe and
 
00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:43.480 align:start position:0%
life altering so what does this bill
 
00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:46.240 align:start position:0%
do it amends the New Hampshire New
 
00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:48.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's child protection act to give
 
00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:51.000 align:start position:0%
Family Division judges the discretion to
 
00:30:53.909 --> 00:30:53.919 align:start position:0%
appoint councel for children at any time
 
00:30:56.950 --> 00:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
in abuse and neglect cases under current
 
00:30:59.909 --> 00:30:59.919 align:start position:0%
Law Courts May only appoint Council for
 
00:31:02.509 --> 00:31:02.519 align:start position:0%
children in abuse and neglected cases
 
00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:05.240 align:start position:0%
and very limited circumstances however
 
00:31:08.669 --> 00:31:08.679 align:start position:0%
situ situations may arise at any point
 
00:31:10.789 --> 00:31:10.799 align:start position:0%
in an abuse and neglect case in which a
 
00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
child's welfare would best be served by
 
00:31:16.269 --> 00:31:16.279 align:start position:0%
the appointment of councel regardless of
 
00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:18.200 align:start position:0%
whether the child's expressed wishes
 
00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
conflict with the guardian Ed Liam's
 
00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
recommendations and this bill provides
 
00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:26.200 align:start position:0%
uh more flexibility for courts to
 
00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:28.240 align:start position:0%
determine whether and when when to
 
00:31:31.269 --> 00:31:31.279 align:start position:0%
appoint a council for children it also
 
00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
adds a new provision to the child
 
00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:36.200 align:start position:0%
protection act requir requiring
 
00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
mandatory appointment for children uh
 
00:31:40.669 --> 00:31:40.679 align:start position:0%
excuse me appointment of councel for
 
00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:43.480 align:start position:0%
children who are placed in or at high
 
00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:46.440 align:start position:0%
risk of placement in any group home or
 
00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
residential Child Care institution as
 
00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:53.960 align:start position:0%
defined by RSA 170 e colon 25 or
 
00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
certified by the department for the care
 
00:31:59.470 --> 00:31:59.480 align:start position:0%
of children pursuant to RSA
 
00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
169c or in any state operated
 
00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
residential treatment program so um this
 
00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
includes children um being placed as I
 
00:32:13.710 --> 00:32:13.720 align:start position:0%
said at uh Residential Care both in and
 
00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:16.760 align:start position:0%
out of state because I think we all know
 
00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
that we do Place children out of state
 
00:32:20.549 --> 00:32:20.559 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that we're trying
 
00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
to do is to bring them back here to the
 
00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire but we also
 
00:32:29.789 --> 00:32:29.799 align:start position:0%
realize that we don't there we don't
 
00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:32.200 align:start position:0%
have sometimes the type of facilities
 
00:32:34.350 --> 00:32:34.360 align:start position:0%
that a child really needs it's a very
 
00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:38.120 align:start position:0%
unique and different situation and those
 
00:32:40.669 --> 00:32:40.679 align:start position:0%
are the kids that are being placed out
 
00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:43.880 align:start position:0%
of state I believe um we had a a child
 
00:32:47.149 --> 00:32:47.159 align:start position:0%
oversight Services meeting last Friday
 
00:32:48.909 --> 00:32:48.919 align:start position:0%
and I believe we were told there's
 
00:32:51.549 --> 00:32:51.559 align:start position:0%
either two or three that are currently
 
00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
placed out of state but we're really
 
00:32:58.310 --> 00:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
trying hard to keep them here or uh just
 
00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:01.000 align:start position:0%
to get them treatment here so just to
 
00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:03.320 align:start position:0%
kind of give you that kind of an
 
00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
update um we know that these children
 
00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
when they're placed in these types of
 
00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
setting outside of their homes um
 
00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
they're removed from their schools their
 
00:33:16.669 --> 00:33:16.679 align:start position:0%
communities family and friends um and
 
00:33:18.789 --> 00:33:18.799 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you all know of the story of
 
00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:22.360 align:start position:0%
what was going on at bledo Academy the
 
00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:24.360 align:start position:0%
uh our child advocate is here and I'm
 
00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
sure she'll go into that um in more
 
00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:28.870 align:start position:0%
sure she'll go into that um in more
detail

00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
detail
 
00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
um this uh bill would require Council
 
00:33:34.269 --> 00:33:34.279 align:start position:0%
for a fraction of children in child
 
00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
protection cases I believe that you
 
00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:40.200 align:start position:0%
folks dealt with House Bill
 
00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
535 um this bill Reigns it in makes it
 
00:33:47.149 --> 00:33:47.159 align:start position:0%
much tighter um just to kind of give you
 
00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:51.240 align:start position:0%
um just an idea because we still have um
 
00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:52.440 align:start position:0%
house B
 
00:33:56.669 --> 00:33:56.679 align:start position:0%
535 um that bill we were told was going
 
00:33:59.909 --> 00:33:59.919 align:start position:0%
to cost about 1.5 million and that was a
 
00:34:03.549 --> 00:34:03.559 align:start position:0%
conservative estimate this one will cost
 
00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
um a little over 500,000 because we're
 
00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:09.320 align:start position:0%
only looking at children that are at
 
00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
risk at at being removed from a
 
00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.909 align:start position:0%
risk at at being removed from a
home

00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:13.919 align:start position:0%
home
 
00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:17.919 align:start position:0%
um it again and it uh adds a new
 
00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
provision granting um appointed councel
 
00:34:23.869 --> 00:34:23.879 align:start position:0%
the right to view and copy the child's
 
00:34:26.869 --> 00:34:26.879 align:start position:0%
medical psychological education and
 
00:34:29.470 --> 00:34:29.480 align:start position:0%
other records necessary for the council
 
00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
to provide competent legal
 
00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
representation and Records provided to
 
00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
council under the section shall only be
 
00:34:39.109 --> 00:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
used for proceedings under the child
 
00:34:41.829 --> 00:34:41.839 align:start position:0%
protection act so they're going to get
 
00:34:44.629 --> 00:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
access to all their records and those
 
00:34:46.869 --> 00:34:46.879 align:start position:0%
records are protected and I think that's
 
00:34:48.869 --> 00:34:48.879 align:start position:0%
very important when we're talking about
 
00:34:51.869 --> 00:34:51.879 align:start position:0%
children it adds um a new provision to
 
00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
the foster care children's Bill of
 
00:34:57.270 --> 00:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
Rights requiring notice uh to the child
 
00:34:59.589 --> 00:34:59.599 align:start position:0%
of their right to appointed
 
00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:03.240 align:start position:0%
councel so the question is why why do
 
00:35:06.069 --> 00:35:06.079 align:start position:0%
these children in these particular
 
00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
situations um need attorneys well first
 
00:35:12.109 --> 00:35:12.119 align:start position:0%
of all they're legal parties to abuse
 
00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
and neglect
 
00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:15.640 align:start position:0%
cases and the New Hampshire child
 
00:35:17.310 --> 00:35:17.320 align:start position:0%
protection act and foster care
 
00:35:19.510 --> 00:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
children's Bill of Rights provide
 
00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
children with many legal rights which
 
00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
only legal council can ensure are
 
00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
protected children again uh face
 
00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:30.680 align:start position:0%
potential loss of their family friends
 
00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:33.160 align:start position:0%
belongings and communities through no
 
00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:36.160 align:start position:0%
fault of their own and I think that's
 
00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
important um because these children are
 
00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
abused and neglected and often times
 
00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
they're made to feel that it's their
 
00:35:47.230 --> 00:35:47.240 align:start position:0%
fault and it's not it is not their
 
00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
fault children may be subjected to abuse
 
00:35:53.069 --> 00:35:53.079 align:start position:0%
or neglect in residential facilities
 
00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:56.040 align:start position:0%
including possibly being subjected to
 
00:35:58.950 --> 00:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
prone restraint which is is now unlawful
 
00:36:03.109 --> 00:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire despite passing a law
 
00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
um the children's oversight commission
 
00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
still receives complaints about children
 
00:36:13.069 --> 00:36:13.079 align:start position:0%
that are um subjected to prone
 
00:36:15.870 --> 00:36:15.880 align:start position:0%
restraints um children deserve to have
 
00:36:18.589 --> 00:36:18.599 align:start position:0%
their voices heard and respected
 
00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
especially in matters that will
 
00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:23.400 align:start position:0%
significantly impact their lives having
 
00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
counsil to represent the child's
 
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:28.240 align:start position:0%
expressed interest will EMP power the
 
00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:30.680 align:start position:0%
child in situations where they have
 
00:36:33.309 --> 00:36:33.319 align:start position:0%
little control and the stakes are
 
00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:36.680 align:start position:0%
incredibly High providing counsel for
 
00:36:38.309 --> 00:36:38.319 align:start position:0%
children placed in residential
 
00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
facilities or at risk of such placements
 
00:36:42.910 --> 00:36:42.920 align:start position:0%
will ensure that their rights are
 
00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:45.880 align:start position:0%
adequately protected the attorneys
 
00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
appointed for children will provide
 
00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:51.200 align:start position:0%
legal advice and develop legal strategy
 
00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
they'll represent the child's
 
00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:54.760 align:start position:0%
perspective and express the child's
 
00:36:58.030 --> 00:36:58.040 align:start position:0%
wishes to the court help
 
00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:00.200 align:start position:0%
help the child understand their options
 
00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
and fully participate in legal
 
00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
proceedings and ensure the child is
 
00:37:08.109 --> 00:37:08.119 align:start position:0%
treated fairly through the legal
 
00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
proceedings providing counsel for
 
00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
children in these cases is a nationally
 
00:37:16.349 --> 00:37:16.359 align:start position:0%
recognized best practice children who
 
00:37:19.390 --> 00:37:19.400 align:start position:0%
have legal representation obtain better
 
00:37:22.589 --> 00:37:22.599 align:start position:0%
results than those who do not including
 
00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:25.000 align:start position:0%
less time in foster care or group
 
00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:27.560 align:start position:0%
settings shorter time to reunify
 
00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
ification with their parents adoption or
 
00:37:33.589 --> 00:37:33.599 align:start position:0%
guardianship we were told on Friday that
 
00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
currently there's a young boy um who's I
 
00:37:39.589 --> 00:37:39.599 align:start position:0%
believe 11 years old who has been in a
 
00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
group home for over five
 
00:37:45.150 --> 00:37:45.160 align:start position:0%
years that's unacceptable and we have to
 
00:37:47.069 --> 00:37:47.079 align:start position:0%
take care of
 
00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:50.720 align:start position:0%
that and there are fewer School
 
00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:53.240 align:start position:0%
transitions we in New Hampshire are an
 
00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
outlier outlier it we fail to protect
 
00:37:59.349 --> 00:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
children rights in ways that most other
 
00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
states do New Hampshire is one of only
 
00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:05.880 align:start position:0%
13 states that do not guarantee the
 
00:38:07.950 --> 00:38:07.960 align:start position:0%
right to counsel for all children
 
00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
throughout abuse and neglect
 
00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:12.760 align:start position:0%
proceedings and I've I've got the list
 
00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
of I don't know if you want me to tell
 
00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:17.480 align:start position:0%
them no okay New Hampshire is only one
 
00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:20.240 align:start position:0%
of six states that does not guarantee
 
00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
the right to councel for children in
 
00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:26.200 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect proceedings under any
 
00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:27.790 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect proceedings under any
circumstances

00:38:27.790 --> 00:38:27.800 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
00:38:30.589 --> 00:38:30.599 align:start position:0%

testimony um I will try to answer
 
00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
questions but as you can probably see we

are coming from is the state hiring
 
00:39:05.109 --> 00:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
attorneys for this purpose to be state
 
00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:07.280 align:start position:0%

to the department they're the ones that
 
00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:15.400 align:start position:0%

advocate and you do know what rule one
 
00:39:44.990 --> 00:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
in this committee is don't

you fulfilled turn the light turn the
 
00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
mic on yeah thank you good morning Mr
 
00:39:54.349 --> 00:39:54.359 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for allowing us
 
00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
to testify this morning we are here in
 
00:39:59.150 --> 00:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
support of Senate Bill
 
00:40:01.950 --> 00:40:01.960 align:start position:0%
463 um as you heard prior to our
 
00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
testimony um sorry Alyssa is going to
 
00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:06.760 align:start position:0%
pass out some written testimony as I
 
00:40:08.589 --> 00:40:08.599 align:start position:0%
start here um but as you heard from
 
00:40:10.430 --> 00:40:10.440 align:start position:0%
Senator Carson as she was presenting the
 
00:40:14.910 --> 00:40:14.920 align:start position:0%
bill um our children in care do suffer
 
00:40:17.069 --> 00:40:17.079 align:start position:0%
quite a lot and um they do have
 
00:40:19.390 --> 00:40:19.400 align:start position:0%
Advocates currently already through
 
00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
Casas but their expressed interest is
 
00:40:23.470 --> 00:40:23.480 align:start position:0%
not currently represented in the court
 
00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:25.800 align:start position:0%
case um they are currently the only
 
00:40:29.109 --> 00:40:29.119 align:start position:0%
parties in these cases that do not have
 
00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:31.240 align:start position:0%
legal representation and those are our
 
00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:33.960 align:start position:0%
most vulnerable parties in all of this
 
00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:36.200 align:start position:0%
um so it is it is quite critical that we
 
00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
um seek to add these protections for our
 
00:40:42.109 --> 00:40:42.119 align:start position:0%
children and advocacy in the court Arena
 
00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
um to add to that as as she shared um we
 
00:40:47.309 --> 00:40:47.319 align:start position:0%
did have the experience of going to
 
00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
bledo Youth Academy um but that is just
 
00:40:51.829 --> 00:40:51.839 align:start position:0%
one example of many where we see
 
00:40:54.589 --> 00:40:54.599 align:start position:0%
children lingering and Residential Care
 
00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
um so where this bill adds the
 
00:40:58.349 --> 00:40:58.359 align:start position:0%
protections particularly for children
 
00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:00.200 align:start position:0%
either already placed in residential
 
00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:03.200 align:start position:0%
care or at risk of residential placement
 
00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
um it is critical that we help these
 
00:41:06.990 --> 00:41:07.000 align:start position:0%
children move along in their placement
 
00:41:08.910 --> 00:41:08.920 align:start position:0%
in their treatment and return to a
 
00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:10.200 align:start position:0%
community setting so they have an
 
00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:13.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity for better outcomes long
 
00:41:16.270 --> 00:41:16.280 align:start position:0%
term um currently um you will see in the
 
00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
written testimony on the final page we
 
00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
have an update of the data for children
 
00:41:24.309 --> 00:41:24.319 align:start position:0%
and placement as of the end of March um
 
00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:26.240 align:start position:0%
when we are talking about children
 
00:41:28.589 --> 00:41:28.599 align:start position:0%
currently in residential care that would
 
00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
be receiving attorneys we are
 
00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
particularly looking if you look at that
 
00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
top box under CPS and um lined with
 
00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
group CARE there is
 
00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:39.480 align:start position:0%
124 children that are involved in child
 
00:41:42.510 --> 00:41:42.520 align:start position:0%
protection that are in residential care
 
00:41:44.309 --> 00:41:44.319 align:start position:0%
um so we are not looking at an extremely
 
00:41:46.390 --> 00:41:46.400 align:start position:0%
large number when we're looking at total
 
00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:47.640 align:start position:0%
children in care we're looking at about
 
00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
1,200 in a given time but we're talking
 
00:41:52.150 --> 00:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
about around 120 children that would
 
00:41:54.190 --> 00:41:54.200 align:start position:0%
need this representation just slightly
 
00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
above that number because we're also
 
00:41:58.069 --> 00:41:58.079 align:start position:0%
capturing Children at Risk um but we're
 
00:41:59.230 --> 00:41:59.240 align:start position:0%
not looking at a large number of
 
00:42:00.870 --> 00:42:00.880 align:start position:0%
children and a large number of attorneys
 
00:42:02.829 --> 00:42:02.839 align:start position:0%
needed um but we are looking at our
 
00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:05.160 align:start position:0%
higher needs children and those that do
 
00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
often linger for quite some time in care
 
00:42:09.349 --> 00:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
um also to share you will see if you
 
00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:10.720 align:start position:0%
look down in the bottom right hand
 
00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
corner children outside of New England
 
00:42:15.349 --> 00:42:15.359 align:start position:0%
as of the end of March is totaling seven
 
00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:18.040 align:start position:0%
children as of the end of February we
 
00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
were down to two so we've had quite an
 
00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
increase in just a month period of time
 
00:42:25.990 --> 00:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
why is that happening um we hear a lot
 
00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:27.200 align:start position:0%
of different reasons why that's
 
00:42:29.589 --> 00:42:29.599 align:start position:0%
happening our facilities here are full
 
00:42:31.630 --> 00:42:31.640 align:start position:0%
or are unable to accept these children
 
00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:34.160 align:start position:0%
due to behaviors um they have
 
00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
potentially been in some of the the
 
00:42:37.150 --> 00:42:37.160 align:start position:0%
programs in state and those programs
 
00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:38.800 align:start position:0%
have not been successful for them so
 
00:42:40.270 --> 00:42:40.280 align:start position:0%
they are being sent out of state for
 
00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:43.160 align:start position:0%
higher level treatment um but what we
 
00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
see when we see this number rise is we
 
00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
see children being pulled from their
 
00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
communities from their core
 
00:42:50.950 --> 00:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
relationships their schools their
 
00:42:54.829 --> 00:42:54.839 align:start position:0%
families and not having that consistent
 
00:42:58.670 --> 00:42:58.680 align:start position:0%
tie back to the life that they once knew
 
00:43:00.990 --> 00:43:01.000 align:start position:0%
once they leave this leave our state or
 
00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
far away from our state as you know
 
00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
we've discussed in many other bills this
 
00:43:06.190 --> 00:43:06.200 align:start position:0%
session that we really would like to see
 
00:43:07.750 --> 00:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
as many of our children stay as close to
 
00:43:09.190 --> 00:43:09.200 align:start position:0%
home as possible and stay in these
 
00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
family-like settings and it truly does
 
00:43:14.190 --> 00:43:14.200 align:start position:0%
take them being closer to home and
 
00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
having appropriate advocacy for those
 
00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
treatment episodes to be shortterm to
 
00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:20.440 align:start position:0%
truly address the problem and then
 
00:43:22.549 --> 00:43:22.559 align:start position:0%
return the children to their communities
 
00:43:24.270 --> 00:43:24.280 align:start position:0%
and we do believe this bill is going to
 
00:43:26.950 --> 00:43:26.960 align:start position:0%
help um this along with with other bills
 
00:43:28.790 --> 00:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
that that have been before us um this
 
00:43:30.750 --> 00:43:30.760 align:start position:0%
session we do believe in conjunction
 
00:43:32.549 --> 00:43:32.559 align:start position:0%
these bills will help move New Hampshire
 
00:43:34.030 --> 00:43:34.040 align:start position:0%
in the right direction to continue to
 
00:43:35.829 --> 00:43:35.839 align:start position:0%
reduce out of home placements for
 
00:43:37.309 --> 00:43:37.319 align:start position:0%
children and continue to reduce the
 
00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
length of time um as you heard from
 
00:43:42.030 --> 00:43:42.040 align:start position:0%
Senator Carson Lissa and I did have the
 
00:43:44.589 --> 00:43:44.599 align:start position:0%
experience of going to um Pine Haven boy
 
00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:46.680 align:start position:0%
Center and meeting with a young child
 
00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:48.280 align:start position:0%
there who had been in that program off
 
00:43:51.150 --> 00:43:51.160 align:start position:0%
and on for 5 years that is far too long
 
00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:53.640 align:start position:0%
for one child to linger and Care um of
 
00:43:55.109 --> 00:43:55.119 align:start position:0%
course there's there's a multitude of
 
00:43:57.589 --> 00:43:57.599 align:start position:0%
reasons as to why that happens um but we
 
00:43:59.150 --> 00:43:59.160 align:start position:0%
do believe that he needs adequate
 
00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
representation to be able to move along
 
00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
and end up in a family setting and
 
00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:05.880 align:start position:0%
ideally sooner rather than later when we
 
00:44:07.230 --> 00:44:07.240 align:start position:0%
have a child that's been in a program
 
00:44:08.589 --> 00:44:08.599 align:start position:0%
like that where they can enter as young
 
00:44:10.750 --> 00:44:10.760 align:start position:0%
as five or six years old and has been in
 
00:44:12.309 --> 00:44:12.319 align:start position:0%
that program for 5 years plus now
 
00:44:14.109 --> 00:44:14.119 align:start position:0%
they're approaching their teenage years
 
00:44:16.349 --> 00:44:16.359 align:start position:0%
and it's a lot harder to look to foster
 
00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
homes and adoptive homes to take in
 
00:44:21.390 --> 00:44:21.400 align:start position:0%
those children and provide level of
 
00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
permanency that they
 
00:44:26.549 --> 00:44:26.559 align:start position:0%
need and just anecdotally to add to that
 
00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:28.880 align:start position:0%
the import of attorneys um we've had
 
00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:30.760 align:start position:0%
another several cases recently where
 
00:44:33.230 --> 00:44:33.240 align:start position:0%
children are Ed boarding for upwards of
 
00:44:36.069 --> 00:44:36.079 align:start position:0%
a month two months in one particular
 
00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:37.800 align:start position:0%
case uh the child was in the
 
00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
guardianship of the state so there's not
 
00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
even a parent advocating necessarily
 
00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
they were looking to send this child
 
00:44:46.510 --> 00:44:46.520 align:start position:0%
thousands of miles away to a newly
 
00:44:49.109 --> 00:44:49.119 align:start position:0%
certified out ofate placement but with
 
00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
some creative work with the division
 
00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
that child is now successfully in a
 
00:44:55.630 --> 00:44:55.640 align:start position:0%
foster home so again there's lots of
 
00:44:57.710 --> 00:44:57.720 align:start position:0%
situations where
 
00:44:59.710 --> 00:44:59.720 align:start position:0%
having additional advocacy and our
 
00:45:01.470 --> 00:45:01.480 align:start position:0%
office can do some but again we're an
 
00:45:04.190 --> 00:45:04.200 align:start position:0%
office of eight people having an
 
00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
attorney that attorney would be doing
 
00:45:07.549 --> 00:45:07.559 align:start position:0%
that work to say that that's not
 
00:45:09.190 --> 00:45:09.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate that level of care is not
 
00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:10.480 align:start position:0%
appropriate this child doesn't need to
 
00:45:13.270 --> 00:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
be thousands of miles away um so an
 
00:45:15.630 --> 00:45:15.640 align:start position:0%
attorney in a case would definitely add
 
00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
that layer of advocacy in that case
 
00:45:19.349 --> 00:45:19.359 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that child also didn't
 
00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
have a casa because as we know Casas are
 
00:45:23.309 --> 00:45:23.319 align:start position:0%
also excellent advocates for children
 
00:45:25.790 --> 00:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
but there are children in care who are
 
00:45:28.630 --> 00:45:28.640 align:start position:0%
Beyond uh the normal reunification case
 
00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
that you don't even have Casas sometimes
 
00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
so um I did just want to point out to
 
00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:36.400 align:start position:0%
you at the bottom of page two and on to
 
00:45:38.549 --> 00:45:38.559 align:start position:0%
three I know this committee doesn't
 
00:45:40.670 --> 00:45:40.680 align:start position:0%
often look at the fiscal pieces but
 
00:45:43.230 --> 00:45:43.240 align:start position:0%
unfortunately some of these bills um
 
00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
especially when read together the fiscal
 
00:45:50.510 --> 00:45:50.520 align:start position:0%
notes are um difficult to explain and
 
00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:54.400 align:start position:0%
fluctuating wildly um Senator Carson
 
00:45:58.150 --> 00:45:58.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned that HB 535 had a price tag of
 
00:46:02.150 --> 00:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
1.5 million but somehow HB 463 has a
 
00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:05.200 align:start position:0%
price tag of 500,000 they are the exact
 
00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
same bill other than the finding of
 
00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
facts exact same number of positions and
 
00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
types of positions so we do worry that
 
00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
the number of positions being requested
 
00:46:17.630 --> 00:46:17.640 align:start position:0%
the types and levels of positions being
 
00:46:19.470 --> 00:46:19.480 align:start position:0%
requested particularly when you look at
 
00:46:21.150 --> 00:46:21.160 align:start position:0%
all three of the bills you're looking at
 
00:46:23.470 --> 00:46:23.480 align:start position:0%
today in concert which also I know house
 
00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
finance will do just to look closely at
 
00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
that I I know that you all are also
 
00:46:29.589 --> 00:46:29.599 align:start position:0%
concerned about the finances even though
 
00:46:31.829 --> 00:46:31.839 align:start position:0%
you're a policy committee so we did just
 
00:46:33.309 --> 00:46:33.319 align:start position:0%
include a little bit of information
 
00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
there on the bottom of page two and on
 
00:46:38.710 --> 00:46:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:41.950 --> 00:46:41.960 align:start position:0%
consider we are open to
 
00:46:44.990 --> 00:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
questions this bill takes effect in 14
 
00:46:48.589 --> 00:46:48.599 align:start position:0%
months plus July 1st
 
00:46:51.829 --> 00:46:51.839 align:start position:0%
2025 correct as of that date how many
 
00:46:55.230 --> 00:46:55.240 align:start position:0%
more lawyers will there need to be in
 
00:47:00.750 --> 00:47:00.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:02.589 --> 00:47:02.599 align:start position:0%
uh currently there are already parent
 
00:47:04.990 --> 00:47:05.000 align:start position:0%
attorneys that judicial Council assigns
 
00:47:07.069 --> 00:47:07.079 align:start position:0%
so there is already a pool of attorneys
 
00:47:07.079 --> 00:47:08.230 align:start position:0%
so there is already a pool of attorneys
who

00:47:08.230 --> 00:47:08.240 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:47:11.390 --> 00:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
represent opposite dcyf I myself was a
 
00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
parent side attorney for about four
 
00:47:15.910 --> 00:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
years earlier in my career we would
 
00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
presume that some of those attorneys
 
00:47:18.750 --> 00:47:18.760 align:start position:0%
would also represent children some of
 
00:47:20.549 --> 00:47:20.559 align:start position:0%
them are also gal's so they do kind of
 
00:47:23.309 --> 00:47:23.319 align:start position:0%
float between cases in addition that
 
00:47:27.069 --> 00:47:27.079 align:start position:0%
gives uh the Judiciary time to do
 
00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:29.240 align:start position:0%
Outreach and due training already just
 
00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
this past year there was a training
 
00:47:34.510 --> 00:47:34.520 align:start position:0%
offered by the courts in conjunction
 
00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
with a national uh attorney organization
 
00:47:39.510 --> 00:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
that did parent attorneys and there was
 
00:47:41.630 --> 00:47:41.640 align:start position:0%
dozens of attorneys that showed up to
 
00:47:44.190 --> 00:47:44.200 align:start position:0%
that training including many firsttime
 
00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
attorneys wanting to represent parents
 
00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:48.920 align:start position:0%
so it'd be a similar pool as we said
 
00:47:53.790 --> 00:47:53.800 align:start position:0%
there's only 124 children so typically
 
00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
you know a case load they're they're
 
00:47:56.950 --> 00:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
handling multiple attorneys I know know
 
00:47:58.670 --> 00:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
when I was a parent attorney I may have
 
00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
five or six cases on my case load in
 
00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:02.720 align:start position:0%
addition to my private practice there
 
00:48:04.270 --> 00:48:04.280 align:start position:0%
are some attorneys that this is all they
 
00:48:06.589 --> 00:48:06.599 align:start position:0%
do their entire case load is these
 
00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:09.720 align:start position:0%
contract-based attorneys so I couldn't
 
00:48:13.069 --> 00:48:13.079 align:start position:0%
give you an exact number but 124 kids
 
00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:15.960 align:start position:0%
would not necessarily be that many more
 
00:48:19.150 --> 00:48:19.160 align:start position:0%
attorneys um and and also the judicial
 
00:48:20.549 --> 00:48:20.559 align:start position:0%
council is currently working I believe
 
00:48:22.349 --> 00:48:22.359 align:start position:0%
it heard last week in front of their
 
00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
board on standards for children's
 
00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:26.480 align:start position:0%
attorneys which I think some other folks
 
00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
here can speak more too so the Judiciary
 
00:48:30.829 --> 00:48:30.839 align:start position:0%
is already getting ready for this to
 
00:48:33.150 --> 00:48:33.160 align:start position:0%
happen but they need this bill to pass
 
00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:34.960 align:start position:0%
in order to make it happen but they're
 
00:48:36.270 --> 00:48:36.280 align:start position:0%
they're laying the groundwork and
 
00:48:37.870 --> 00:48:37.880 align:start position:0%
there's definitely attorneys out there
 
00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
that want to do this type of work and
 
00:48:43.230 --> 00:48:43.240 align:start position:0%
already doing similar DCF related work
 
00:48:45.309 --> 00:48:45.319 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions uh
 
00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond thank you Mr
 
00:48:49.150 --> 00:48:49.160 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
00:48:52.510 --> 00:48:52.520 align:start position:0%
question so my question is about the
 
00:48:54.870 --> 00:48:54.880 align:start position:0%
effective date so this would take effect
 
00:48:57.829 --> 00:48:57.839 align:start position:0%
July 1st 2025 those
 
00:49:01.349 --> 00:49:01.359 align:start position:0%
120ish kids would they automatically
 
00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
qualify to get attorneys or would it
 
00:49:06.309 --> 00:49:06.319 align:start position:0%
only be uh children entering group homes
 
00:49:08.910 --> 00:49:08.920 align:start position:0%
after that point it would be children in
 
00:49:11.870 --> 00:49:11.880 align:start position:0%
Care at that time frame it hopefully
 
00:49:13.270 --> 00:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
would be a different pool of children in
 
00:49:14.589 --> 00:49:14.599 align:start position:0%
that time frame because they should be
 
00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:16.720 align:start position:0%
moved on elsewhere and not linger in
 
00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:18.640 align:start position:0%
care for for a length of time but it
 
00:49:20.109 --> 00:49:20.119 align:start position:0%
should it would include all of the
 
00:49:22.549 --> 00:49:22.559 align:start position:0%
children that are already in group home
 
00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
care and then any that are in that at
 
00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
risk category okay thank you
 
00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
representative McMahon thank you Mr
 
00:49:33.789 --> 00:49:33.799 align:start position:0%
chairman uh question either one of the
 
00:49:36.270 --> 00:49:36.280 align:start position:0%
professionals here uh in the in page one
 
00:49:38.390 --> 00:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
of the bill where it states the court
 
00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
shall appoint a casa representative or
 
00:49:45.309 --> 00:49:45.319 align:start position:0%
if it's not available they may then
 
00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
appoint an attorney and then though in
 
00:49:49.630 --> 00:49:49.640 align:start position:0%
section two there's a new addition where
 
00:49:53.470 --> 00:49:53.480 align:start position:0%
in that again it says it may appoint if
 
00:49:56.230 --> 00:49:56.240 align:start position:0%
the if a child requests the appointment
 
00:49:58.549 --> 00:49:58.559 align:start position:0%
is does that indicate an out where
 
00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
nothing happens and an out meaning for
 
00:50:04.829 --> 00:50:04.839 align:start position:0%
the authority having jurisdiction to do
 
00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:06.720 align:start position:0%
something for the for the the case
 
00:50:08.030 --> 00:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
that's in front of
 
00:50:11.309 --> 00:50:11.319 align:start position:0%
them and that's in that wording in page
 
00:50:13.990 --> 00:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
page one line 22 you'll see in that
 
00:50:17.230 --> 00:50:17.240 align:start position:0%
paragraph and then page uh page
 
00:50:20.950 --> 00:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
two the the uh study in line five it's
 
00:50:24.950 --> 00:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
where where the new um in Black wording
 
00:50:27.390 --> 00:50:27.400 align:start position:0%
was put in and
 
00:50:30.190 --> 00:50:30.200 align:start position:0%
has this may appoint versus shall so I
 
00:50:31.589 --> 00:50:31.599 align:start position:0%
believe the language you're pointing to
 
00:50:34.349 --> 00:50:34.359 align:start position:0%
is current law
 
00:50:38.309 --> 00:50:38.319 align:start position:0%
um the currently the court is required
 
00:50:41.789 --> 00:50:41.799 align:start position:0%
to appoint a casa if there's not a casa
 
00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
available either because they don't have
 
00:50:45.270 --> 00:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
enough or there's some sort of conflict
 
00:50:48.109 --> 00:50:48.119 align:start position:0%
there is also a pool of private Guardian
 
00:50:51.470 --> 00:50:51.480 align:start position:0%
ad lims some of whom are attorneys so
 
00:50:52.950 --> 00:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
that's why that's worded that way
 
00:50:55.589 --> 00:50:55.599 align:start position:0%
because financially the state doesn't
 
00:50:57.510 --> 00:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
pay costes they're volun so that's why
 
00:50:58.870 --> 00:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
that's the first choice is this
 
00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:00.720 align:start position:0%
volunteer Casa program which a majority
 
00:51:03.349 --> 00:51:03.359 align:start position:0%
of children do get if there's an issue
 
00:51:05.549 --> 00:51:05.559 align:start position:0%
though that's where it it then flips
 
00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:08.520 align:start position:0%
over to they they do need a guardian at
 
00:51:11.430 --> 00:51:11.440 align:start position:0%
Lim it might be an attorney or it might
 
00:51:13.510 --> 00:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
be a certified guardian adlum and I know
 
00:51:15.069 --> 00:51:15.079 align:start position:0%
we've talked in this body before about
 
00:51:17.430 --> 00:51:17.440 align:start position:0%
the guardian ad lium board so it's just
 
00:51:20.349 --> 00:51:20.359 align:start position:0%
different groups of people playing that
 
00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
same role so that's really kind of
 
00:51:25.789 --> 00:51:25.799 align:start position:0%
current law the new law is exactly where
 
00:51:28.230 --> 00:51:28.240 align:start position:0%
you pointed where
 
00:51:32.069 --> 00:51:32.079 align:start position:0%
now that second paragraph the court
 
00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
already has discretion to appoint an
 
00:51:35.870 --> 00:51:35.880 align:start position:0%
attorney to children but it's very
 
00:51:38.789 --> 00:51:38.799 align:start position:0%
limited in current law it's only at the
 
00:51:40.309 --> 00:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
dispositional hearing which is very
 
00:51:42.549 --> 00:51:42.559 align:start position:0%
early in the case and it's only if
 
00:51:45.270 --> 00:51:45.280 align:start position:0%
there's an ex like a conflict between
 
00:51:47.630 --> 00:51:47.640 align:start position:0%
Casa and what the child is saying this
 
00:51:49.870 --> 00:51:49.880 align:start position:0%
just broadens that discretion to the
 
00:51:52.789 --> 00:51:52.799 align:start position:0%
judge that they could appoint a a
 
00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
children's attorney at any point during
 
00:51:56.630 --> 00:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
the case not at that one moment of the
 
00:51:58.630 --> 00:51:58.640 align:start position:0%
dispositional hearing and it's a little
 
00:52:00.390 --> 00:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
bit broader in that there doesn't
 
00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
necessarily have to be a conflict at the
 
00:52:05.349 --> 00:52:05.359 align:start position:0%
ca's saying it could just be the child
 
00:52:07.109 --> 00:52:07.119 align:start position:0%
expressing and again that's totally at
 
00:52:09.789 --> 00:52:09.799 align:start position:0%
the judge's discretion currently and
 
00:52:11.589 --> 00:52:11.599 align:start position:0%
presumably even under this it'd be
 
00:52:13.870 --> 00:52:13.880 align:start position:0%
something pretty serious not like hey I
 
00:52:15.549 --> 00:52:15.559 align:start position:0%
don't like the seral my foster parents
 
00:52:17.950 --> 00:52:17.960 align:start position:0%
give me it it'd be something serious
 
00:52:21.870 --> 00:52:21.880 align:start position:0%
that new whole section Roman 2B that's
 
00:52:24.789 --> 00:52:24.799 align:start position:0%
the new law where the court shall
 
00:52:27.150 --> 00:52:27.160 align:start position:0%
appoint an attorney to any child in
 
00:52:29.230 --> 00:52:29.240 align:start position:0%
residential care currently as uh
 
00:52:32.430 --> 00:52:32.440 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond asked and then
 
00:52:34.589 --> 00:52:34.599 align:start position:0%
there's these trigger points that if the
 
00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
child is at essentially imminent risk of
 
00:52:38.270 --> 00:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
being placed and there's a couple
 
00:52:40.870 --> 00:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
trigger points that we know of when
 
00:52:42.750 --> 00:52:42.760 align:start position:0%
they're sending out a cat evaluation
 
00:52:43.829 --> 00:52:43.839 align:start position:0%
which is sort of what gives you
 
00:52:45.670 --> 00:52:45.680 align:start position:0%
placement levels when they're sending
 
00:52:47.589 --> 00:52:47.599 align:start position:0%
out packets to placements that's how a
 
00:52:50.190 --> 00:52:50.200 align:start position:0%
kid gets placed is you send up a little
 
00:52:52.230 --> 00:52:52.240 align:start position:0%
packet about the kid to NASA children's
 
00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
home to wio to so those are the trigger
 
00:52:58.589 --> 00:52:58.599 align:start position:0%
points that dcy knows we're now actively
 
00:53:01.069 --> 00:53:01.079 align:start position:0%
looking for residential placement they
 
00:53:02.990 --> 00:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
then need to tell the court we're
 
00:53:04.470 --> 00:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
actively looking for residential
 
00:53:05.789 --> 00:53:05.799 align:start position:0%
placement and then the court would
 
00:53:08.230 --> 00:53:08.240 align:start position:0%
appoint an attorney in the hopes that in
 
00:53:10.069 --> 00:53:10.079 align:start position:0%
fact maybe not all those kids end up in
 
00:53:12.789 --> 00:53:12.799 align:start position:0%
placement is the Hope one follow up Mr
 
00:53:15.349 --> 00:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
chairman follow up didn't didn't address
 
00:53:17.230 --> 00:53:17.240 align:start position:0%
you correctly attorney so sorry about
 
00:53:18.829 --> 00:53:18.839 align:start position:0%
that you're welcome to correct me
 
00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:22.480 align:start position:0%
anytime the uh well again relative to
 
00:53:27.670 --> 00:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
this is so that a child is not left
 
00:53:31.230 --> 00:53:31.240 align:start position:0%
alone when uh when in these two cases
 
00:53:32.990 --> 00:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
the two cases in the narrative that's
 
00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:34.720 align:start position:0%
that's in and
 
00:53:38.030 --> 00:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
the uh reference to uh expressed
 
00:53:41.470 --> 00:53:41.480 align:start position:0%
interest of the child is is uh when I
 
00:53:43.230 --> 00:53:43.240 align:start position:0%
see the words may it's it's leaving
 
00:53:46.470 --> 00:53:46.480 align:start position:0%
things in a bance for u u maybe a long
 
00:53:47.589 --> 00:53:47.599 align:start position:0%
time unless you're presentent in the
 
00:53:49.510 --> 00:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
court to see what's what's going down
 
00:53:52.870 --> 00:53:52.880 align:start position:0%
and what isn't uh is this wording
 
00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate enough to ensure that the
 
00:53:58.630 --> 00:53:58.640 align:start position:0%
child that does Express a
 
00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:00.880 align:start position:0%
self-representation interest for for an
 
00:54:03.349 --> 00:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
attorney that this would be answered by
 
00:54:05.710 --> 00:54:05.720 align:start position:0%
the by the judge irrespective of the
 
00:54:07.710 --> 00:54:07.720 align:start position:0%
fact there's not a casa available but
 
00:54:11.390 --> 00:54:11.400 align:start position:0%
that an attorney would be so appointed
 
00:54:12.990 --> 00:54:13.000 align:start position:0%
so the casa is always going to get
 
00:54:14.430 --> 00:54:14.440 align:start position:0%
appointed there's no change to the
 
00:54:17.069 --> 00:54:17.079 align:start position:0%
current law where Casa is appointed the
 
00:54:19.109 --> 00:54:19.119 align:start position:0%
language in that first section is still
 
00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
filling that Casa role that best
 
00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:24.160 align:start position:0%
interest role it's just when aasa isn't
 
00:54:27.349 --> 00:54:27.359 align:start position:0%
available which is not terribly often
 
00:54:31.030 --> 00:54:31.040 align:start position:0%
that attorney is a g attorney it's not a
 
00:54:33.150 --> 00:54:33.160 align:start position:0%
a representation attorney just some
 
00:54:35.630 --> 00:54:35.640 align:start position:0%
attorneys are trained as gal's as well
 
00:54:37.109 --> 00:54:37.119 align:start position:0%
so like I said that pool of parent
 
00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
attorneys they they do fluctuate some of
 
00:54:41.030 --> 00:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
them are trained as G's so you may see
 
00:54:42.549 --> 00:54:42.559 align:start position:0%
the same attorney show up in a case as a
 
00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
parent attorney in the next case they're
 
00:54:46.990 --> 00:54:47.000 align:start position:0%
a gal it's that next two paragraphs that
 
00:54:49.750 --> 00:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
are appointing attorneys to represent
 
00:54:52.390 --> 00:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
that child's interest not that best
 
00:54:54.190 --> 00:54:54.200 align:start position:0%
interest role is the primary difference
 
00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
here then just one final clarification
 
00:55:00.430 --> 00:55:00.440 align:start position:0%
is whether the subject is is to be
 
00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
placed in a group home or out of state
 
00:55:05.829 --> 00:55:05.839 align:start position:0%
as opposed to handling the issue in
 
00:55:08.470 --> 00:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
house and like where they currently
 
00:55:12.430 --> 00:55:12.440 align:start position:0%
live yes so the first paragraph doesn't
 
00:55:14.549 --> 00:55:14.559 align:start position:0%
is not related to residential placement
 
00:55:18.190 --> 00:55:18.200 align:start position:0%
it's just an expressed interest of the
 
00:55:21.190 --> 00:55:21.200 align:start position:0%
child that is you know needing attention
 
00:55:23.230 --> 00:55:23.240 align:start position:0%
the second paragraph is the mandatory
 
00:55:25.270 --> 00:55:25.280 align:start position:0%
one where if a child is in residential
 
00:55:26.789 --> 00:55:26.799 align:start position:0%
placement that could be in state or out
 
00:55:28.870 --> 00:55:28.880 align:start position:0%
of state a group home a treatment
 
00:55:31.470 --> 00:55:31.480 align:start position:0%
facility they are going to get attorneys
 
00:55:34.950 --> 00:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
under this law thank that's those 124
 
00:55:36.950 --> 00:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
kids that we're talking about understood
 
00:55:39.109 --> 00:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
thank thank you attorney representative
 
00:55:41.390 --> 00:55:41.400 align:start position:0%
Nelson thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:55:43.510 --> 00:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
for being here and for taking my
 
00:55:46.230 --> 00:55:46.240 align:start position:0%
question this is specific to children
 
00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
who are non-verbal or who have limited
 
00:55:51.549 --> 00:55:51.559 align:start position:0%
verbal ability and communication skills
 
00:55:54.789 --> 00:55:54.799 align:start position:0%
how do we uh determine for these types
 
00:55:57.309 --> 00:55:57.319 align:start position:0%
of children um how would we know that
 
00:55:59.349 --> 00:55:59.359 align:start position:0%
they would want to request
 
00:56:04.150 --> 00:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
representation and how are um how would
 
00:56:07.470 --> 00:56:07.480 align:start position:0%
the expressed interest of a child be
 
00:56:10.589 --> 00:56:10.599 align:start position:0%
represented um thank you yes thank you
 
00:56:12.549 --> 00:56:12.559 align:start position:0%
for your question um so first and
 
00:56:14.190 --> 00:56:14.200 align:start position:0%
foremost that is the the critical piece
 
00:56:16.910 --> 00:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
of ensuring that it is in the Bill of
 
00:56:19.109 --> 00:56:19.119 align:start position:0%
Rights for children because then it has
 
00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
to be explained to them and if it is a
 
00:56:24.069 --> 00:56:24.079 align:start position:0%
non-verbal child who's at a program it
 
00:56:25.950 --> 00:56:25.960 align:start position:0%
is the DCF staff that would sit down and
 
00:56:27.750 --> 00:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
expl exp the children's Bill of Rights
 
00:56:29.309 --> 00:56:29.319 align:start position:0%
but they should be sitting down with a
 
00:56:31.510 --> 00:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
staff who works at that facility who
 
00:56:33.630 --> 00:56:33.640 align:start position:0%
knows the child well when children are
 
00:56:35.190 --> 00:56:35.200 align:start position:0%
non-verbal it doesn't mean that they
 
00:56:37.109 --> 00:56:37.119 align:start position:0%
can't tell us what they're thinking or
 
00:56:39.510 --> 00:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
feeling it's about the skill in the
 
00:56:41.349 --> 00:56:41.359 align:start position:0%
person eliciting the information to be
 
00:56:43.309 --> 00:56:43.319 align:start position:0%
able to get that from the child and so
 
00:56:45.270 --> 00:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
they should be working with the staff a
 
00:56:46.630 --> 00:56:46.640 align:start position:0%
lot of the programs that have children
 
00:56:48.349 --> 00:56:48.359 align:start position:0%
that are non-verbal have either one to
 
00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:50.720 align:start position:0%
one or two to one very small ratios and
 
00:56:52.109 --> 00:56:52.119 align:start position:0%
so there would be staff that are quite
 
00:56:53.589 --> 00:56:53.599 align:start position:0%
familiar with the child and could pick
 
00:56:55.789 --> 00:56:55.799 align:start position:0%
up on their cues and know that they
 
00:56:58.150 --> 00:56:58.160 align:start position:0%
maybe having that interest and have um
 
00:57:00.190 --> 00:57:00.200 align:start position:0%
and are trying to express that so they
 
00:57:01.990 --> 00:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
would be part of that conversation it
 
00:57:03.789 --> 00:57:03.799 align:start position:0%
would require that specialization and
 
00:57:06.829 --> 00:57:06.839 align:start position:0%
then as as Lisa had mentioned there is
 
00:57:09.390 --> 00:57:09.400 align:start position:0%
they're talking about um standards for
 
00:57:11.670 --> 00:57:11.680 align:start position:0%
um Council for children but that is that
 
00:57:13.710 --> 00:57:13.720 align:start position:0%
next level specialty for when that
 
00:57:16.349 --> 00:57:16.359 align:start position:0%
attorney becomes that repres
 
00:57:18.190 --> 00:57:18.200 align:start position:0%
representative for that child they also
 
00:57:19.789 --> 00:57:19.799 align:start position:0%
need to understand the nuances of
 
00:57:21.190 --> 00:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
working with that child and they should
 
00:57:22.510 --> 00:57:22.520 align:start position:0%
be working very closely with other
 
00:57:25.109 --> 00:57:25.119 align:start position:0%
members of their team with trusted staff
 
00:57:27.950 --> 00:57:27.960 align:start position:0%
with um could be guardians or or other
 
00:57:30.190 --> 00:57:30.200 align:start position:0%
adults in that child's life that know
 
00:57:32.510 --> 00:57:32.520 align:start position:0%
them very well and so they are they are
 
00:57:34.829 --> 00:57:34.839 align:start position:0%
entering part of that team and the hope
 
00:57:36.029 --> 00:57:36.039 align:start position:0%
is that they're working together much
 
00:57:37.789 --> 00:57:37.799 align:start position:0%
like with Casa they also have to do the
 
00:57:39.349 --> 00:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
same when they're working in repes in
 
00:57:40.630 --> 00:57:40.640 align:start position:0%
representing the best interests of these
 
00:57:42.430 --> 00:57:42.440 align:start position:0%
children they have to get to know where
 
00:57:43.870 --> 00:57:43.880 align:start position:0%
they are who they work with who they
 
00:57:45.630 --> 00:57:45.640 align:start position:0%
trust and so they should be an added
 
00:57:46.670 --> 00:57:46.680 align:start position:0%
member of that team and they should be
 
00:57:48.309 --> 00:57:48.319 align:start position:0%
working very closely with KAS and
 
00:57:49.349 --> 00:57:49.359 align:start position:0%
understanding what they're representing
 
00:57:51.349 --> 00:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
for that child thank you I really
 
00:57:52.990 --> 00:57:53.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate that answer thank you
 
00:57:56.309 --> 00:57:56.319 align:start position:0%
representative ball
 
00:57:58.710 --> 00:57:58.720 align:start position:0%
morning thank you for being here um and
 
00:58:01.150 --> 00:58:01.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question you're welcome um
 
00:58:03.990 --> 00:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you chairman
 
00:58:06.630 --> 00:58:06.640 align:start position:0%
par I feel like we've had so many weeks
 
00:58:09.670 --> 00:58:09.680 align:start position:0%
off forgotten my protocol thank you as
 
00:58:13.309 --> 00:58:13.319 align:start position:0%
well for being here um in comparing the
 
00:58:15.789 --> 00:58:15.799 align:start position:0%
house bill 535 to this one I'm only
 
00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
seeing a difference of in line 17 and
 
00:58:23.430 --> 00:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:26.789 --> 00:58:26.799 align:start position:0%
correct I do not have 535 with with me
 
00:58:29.109 --> 00:58:29.119 align:start position:0%
currently but I do understand one of the
 
00:58:34.750 --> 00:58:34.760 align:start position:0%
other um differences between 535 and 463
 
00:58:39.549 --> 00:58:39.559 align:start position:0%
is in the statement of findings where it
 
00:58:41.950 --> 00:58:41.960 align:start position:0%
speaks a bit more to the important role
 
00:58:45.270 --> 00:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
of Casa and how they would continue to
 
00:58:49.230 --> 00:58:49.240 align:start position:0%
be a part of this process um I believe
 
00:58:51.870 --> 00:58:51.880 align:start position:0%
it's just that one is this one 10 um so
 
00:58:53.430 --> 00:58:53.440 align:start position:0%
it's somewhere else you're pointing to
 
00:58:57.309 --> 00:58:57.319 align:start position:0%
page two line 10 through 14
 
00:59:01.870 --> 00:59:01.880 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at um page two line 17 and
 
00:59:06.069 --> 00:59:06.079 align:start position:0%
18 after it said RSA 170 it says or
 
00:59:08.670 --> 00:59:08.680 align:start position:0%
certified by the department and then to
 
00:59:10.470 --> 00:59:10.480 align:start position:0%
the end of that sentence that appears to
 
00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:12.829 align:start position:0%
the end of that sentence that appears to
be

00:59:12.829 --> 00:59:12.839 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:59:15.829 --> 00:59:15.839 align:start position:0%
new so that would be that appears to be
 
00:59:20.029 --> 00:59:20.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:22.390 --> 00:59:22.400 align:start position:0%
between yes thank you for for pointing
 
00:59:24.789 --> 00:59:24.799 align:start position:0%
that out that is a new line it just
 
00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
clarifies to ensure that we are
 
00:59:30.630 --> 00:59:30.640 align:start position:0%
capturing all facilities um under
 
00:59:33.870 --> 00:59:33.880 align:start position:0%
because the RSA 170e is is in regards to
 
00:59:35.589 --> 00:59:35.599 align:start position:0%
licensing and that's the focus of that
 
00:59:37.910 --> 00:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
statute where um there are facilities
 
00:59:40.430 --> 00:59:40.440 align:start position:0%
that are not licensed by the state of
 
00:59:41.870 --> 00:59:41.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire because they are outside
 
00:59:43.069 --> 00:59:43.079 align:start position:0%
of the State of New Hampshire but they
 
00:59:44.750 --> 00:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
are certified by the department so that
 
00:59:46.789 --> 00:59:46.799 align:start position:0%
would capture all of those outof State
 
00:59:48.630 --> 00:59:48.640 align:start position:0%
facilities so that additional line
 
00:59:51.589 --> 00:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
ensures it yes it ensures that it is
 
00:59:53.910 --> 00:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
covering all of those um placements that
 
00:59:55.630 --> 00:59:55.640 align:start position:0%
are certified for placement of children
 
00:59:58.390 --> 00:59:58.400 align:start position:0%
in 169 C cases which are the the child
 
01:00:02.069 --> 01:00:02.079 align:start position:0%
protection cases follow upair follow up
 
01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
so in going back to house bill 5 uh 35 I
 
01:00:08.789 --> 01:00:08.799 align:start position:0%
believe we had passed that 15 to one and
 
01:00:11.069 --> 01:00:11.079 align:start position:0%
so really all we're looking at now is
 
01:00:14.589 --> 01:00:14.599 align:start position:0%
just adding um those two lines to the
 
01:00:16.390 --> 01:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill thank you for that
 
01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
clarification yes thank you and uh 535
 
01:00:22.789 --> 01:00:22.799 align:start position:0%
was heard a few weeks ago in Senate
 
01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:30.069 --> 01:00:30.079 align:start position:0%
any further questions Vice chairman long
 
01:00:31.710 --> 01:00:31.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:00:35.109 --> 01:00:35.119 align:start position:0%
your testimony uh I've I've uh for two
 
01:00:39.829 --> 01:00:39.839 align:start position:0%
or three years now I've had this uh uh
 
01:00:42.069 --> 01:00:42.079 align:start position:0%
thoughts about has you testified to the
 
01:00:44.349 --> 01:00:44.359 align:start position:0%
11y old being an assistant for five to
 
01:00:48.270 --> 01:00:48.280 align:start position:0%
six years uh and also uh uh youth that
 
01:00:51.069 --> 01:00:51.079 align:start position:0%
age out uh what happens after they age
 
01:00:54.910 --> 01:00:54.920 align:start position:0%
out uh so when looking at uh line 15 on
 
01:00:57.109 --> 01:00:57.119 align:start position:0%
page one
 
01:01:02.109 --> 01:01:02.119 align:start position:0%
um I it it it appears that my concerns
 
01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
with that is is going to be addressed
 
01:01:07.150 --> 01:01:07.160 align:start position:0%
with this
 
01:01:11.510 --> 01:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
um uh expressed interest of the child
 
01:01:14.109 --> 01:01:14.119 align:start position:0%
attorney so in your opinion do you feel
 
01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
that they would be more looking not only
 
01:01:19.630 --> 01:01:19.640 align:start position:0%
looking for permanency but looking for
 
01:01:22.950 --> 01:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
if they age out or the longevity that
 
01:01:25.390 --> 01:01:25.400 align:start position:0%
they've been in the system and what why
 
01:01:27.109 --> 01:01:27.119 align:start position:0%
aren't they placed in
 
01:01:29.789 --> 01:01:29.799 align:start position:0%
permanency I I mean I think the examples
 
01:01:31.430 --> 01:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
we were talking about those children
 
01:01:34.430 --> 01:01:34.440 align:start position:0%
were or had been in residential care so
 
01:01:35.910 --> 01:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
they would actually get attorneys the
 
01:01:38.069 --> 01:01:38.079 align:start position:0%
mandatory attorneys under the next
 
01:01:39.589 --> 01:01:39.599 align:start position:0%
section which I think is even more
 
01:01:42.029 --> 01:01:42.039 align:start position:0%
important the expressed interest piece
 
01:01:44.470 --> 01:01:44.480 align:start position:0%
is still at the discretion of the judge
 
01:01:47.549 --> 01:01:47.559 align:start position:0%
so there certainly could be particularly
 
01:01:49.390 --> 01:01:49.400 align:start position:0%
older teens that you're referring to
 
01:01:51.190 --> 01:01:51.200 align:start position:0%
that are expressing an interest maybe at
 
01:01:53.950 --> 01:01:53.960 align:start position:0%
odds with what their Casa is saying that
 
01:01:56.910 --> 01:01:56.920 align:start position:0%
may fall under that first expr rest
 
01:01:59.589 --> 01:01:59.599 align:start position:0%
discretionary piece but most of the kids
 
01:02:01.710 --> 01:02:01.720 align:start position:0%
I think you're referring to have been in
 
01:02:03.430 --> 01:02:03.440 align:start position:0%
residential care or will end up in
 
01:02:05.150 --> 01:02:05.160 align:start position:0%
residential care at some point so would
 
01:02:08.109 --> 01:02:08.119 align:start position:0%
get those mandatory attorneys and yes
 
01:02:10.150 --> 01:02:10.160 align:start position:0%
yes we do believe that they would be
 
01:02:12.789 --> 01:02:12.799 align:start position:0%
looking out for permanency ensuring that
 
01:02:14.109 --> 01:02:14.119 align:start position:0%
there is a plan ensuring that the
 
01:02:16.549 --> 01:02:16.559 align:start position:0%
child's voice is part of that plan which
 
01:02:17.950 --> 01:02:17.960 align:start position:0%
is truly critical when looking at that
 
01:02:19.069 --> 01:02:19.079 align:start position:0%
section there and they're talking about
 
01:02:21.470 --> 01:02:21.480 align:start position:0%
the outcomes and um reduction of time to
 
01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
permanency it is it is critical that the
 
01:02:25.069 --> 01:02:25.079 align:start position:0%
child have Buy in particularly if
 
01:02:26.710 --> 01:02:26.720 align:start position:0%
they're an older child for what their
 
01:02:28.589 --> 01:02:28.599 align:start position:0%
plan is going to be we see many times
 
01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:30.640 align:start position:0%
that a goal may be adoption for an older
 
01:02:32.789 --> 01:02:32.799 align:start position:0%
child but they do not wish to be adopted
 
01:02:33.990 --> 01:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
and so those are the children that will
 
01:02:35.829 --> 01:02:35.839 align:start position:0%
linger because they will not agree to
 
01:02:37.510 --> 01:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
that final permanency plan and so having
 
01:02:39.150 --> 01:02:39.160 align:start position:0%
an attorney that's going to be
 
01:02:41.430 --> 01:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
advocating for what they want can lead
 
01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
to an opportunity for alternative
 
01:02:44.789 --> 01:02:44.799 align:start position:0%
permanency that's going to work for the
 
01:02:46.470 --> 01:02:46.480 align:start position:0%
child they're going to buy into and
 
01:02:47.589 --> 01:02:47.599 align:start position:0%
they're going to put their efforts to
 
01:02:49.549 --> 01:02:49.559 align:start position:0%
make it work okay and now follow if I
 
01:02:52.470 --> 01:02:52.480 align:start position:0%
may on on line 16 uh children who have
 
01:02:54.549 --> 01:02:54.559 align:start position:0%
legal representation fail a sense of
 
01:02:57.910 --> 01:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
agency should be a sense of
 
01:03:01.029 --> 01:03:01.039 align:start position:0%
urgency it is agency agency yes because
 
01:03:02.829 --> 01:03:02.839 align:start position:0%
then their voice is truly heard in the
 
01:03:05.029 --> 01:03:05.039 align:start position:0%
process through their representation
 
01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you maybe urgency as
 
01:03:09.950 --> 01:03:09.960 align:start position:0%
well but we did mean
 
01:03:12.990 --> 01:03:13.000 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
01:03:15.470 --> 01:03:15.480 align:start position:0%
Panic thank you Mr chairman for allowing
 
01:03:17.870 --> 01:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
me to ask a question and thank you for
 
01:03:21.829 --> 01:03:21.839 align:start position:0%
coming in I have one question
 
01:03:25.549 --> 01:03:25.559 align:start position:0%
um if a child is already in placement in
 
01:03:27.630 --> 01:03:27.640 align:start position:0%
like a foster care
 
01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
somewhere and there's abuse going on and
 
01:03:32.430 --> 01:03:32.440 align:start position:0%
the child wants to complain I'm not
 
01:03:35.069 --> 01:03:35.079 align:start position:0%
talking about soggy oat meal I'm talking
 
01:03:38.190 --> 01:03:38.200 align:start position:0%
about real abuse going on this would
 
01:03:40.309 --> 01:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
take care
 
01:03:42.430 --> 01:03:42.440 align:start position:0%
of this would take care of that
 
01:03:44.510 --> 01:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
situation as far as so those children
 
01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
would not be assigned because when we're
 
01:03:48.510 --> 01:03:48.520 align:start position:0%
speaking about um in placement we're
 
01:03:49.589 --> 01:03:49.599 align:start position:0%
talking particularly about group
 
01:03:51.150 --> 01:03:51.160 align:start position:0%
placements or residential facility
 
01:03:53.390 --> 01:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
placements but it would allow that the
 
01:03:57.829 --> 01:03:57.839 align:start position:0%
changes to um that first section on
 
01:04:02.349 --> 01:04:02.359 align:start position:0%
page two that we're talking about um so
 
01:04:06.029 --> 01:04:06.039 align:start position:0%
lines 6 through 8 on page two or sorry
 
01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
my start prior than that it that allows
 
01:04:09.589 --> 01:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
a child to request so if a child is in
 
01:04:11.269 --> 01:04:11.279 align:start position:0%
that situation they're advocating for
 
01:04:12.789 --> 01:04:12.799 align:start position:0%
themselves to those around them and
 
01:04:15.069 --> 01:04:15.079 align:start position:0%
they're not being heard it does allow
 
01:04:17.950 --> 01:04:17.960 align:start position:0%
them to ask to have representation in
 
01:04:19.470 --> 01:04:19.480 align:start position:0%
the court the court does get to make the
 
01:04:20.670 --> 01:04:20.680 align:start position:0%
final determination whether they're
 
01:04:22.670 --> 01:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
going to but previously they could only
 
01:04:24.870 --> 01:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
ask at the disposition as attorney
 
01:04:26.910 --> 01:04:26.920 align:start position:0%
massio was explaining at this point if
 
01:04:28.710 --> 01:04:28.720 align:start position:0%
the disposition has passed and the abuse
 
01:04:30.670 --> 01:04:30.680 align:start position:0%
is happening they have an opportunity to
 
01:04:32.990 --> 01:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
still ask the court for representation
 
01:04:35.309 --> 01:04:35.319 align:start position:0%
and those are those serious situations
 
01:04:37.069 --> 01:04:37.079 align:start position:0%
where we hope the court would take that
 
01:04:38.950 --> 01:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
discretion very seriously and understand
 
01:04:41.390 --> 01:04:41.400 align:start position:0%
that there is a clear reason for that
 
01:04:44.069 --> 01:04:44.079 align:start position:0%
child's safety to have further
 
01:04:46.230 --> 01:04:46.240 align:start position:0%
representation there there is though
 
01:04:48.309 --> 01:04:48.319 align:start position:0%
also a process internally there's a
 
01:04:50.910 --> 01:04:50.920 align:start position:0%
special investigations unit within dcyf
 
01:04:52.510 --> 01:04:52.520 align:start position:0%
that investigates those sorts of
 
01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
allegations within foster homes or group
 
01:04:56.549 --> 01:04:56.559 align:start position:0%
homes as well thank
 
01:04:59.269 --> 01:04:59.279 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:05:02.349 --> 01:05:02.359 align:start position:0%
Bickford thank you Mr
 
01:05:05.150 --> 01:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
chairman and uh thank you for taking my
 
01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
question you have pointed out on your
 
01:05:09.309 --> 01:05:09.319 align:start position:0%
handout on
 
01:05:15.670 --> 01:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
page I second page and uh no next the
 
01:05:17.710 --> 01:05:17.720 align:start position:0%
last at the top you talking about 124
 
01:05:19.430 --> 01:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
children I've heard you mention that a
 
01:05:21.710 --> 01:05:21.720 align:start position:0%
numerous times but isn't that an in
 
01:05:25.150 --> 01:05:25.160 align:start position:0%
camera uh look at the outstanding the
 
01:05:26.789 --> 01:05:26.799 align:start position:0%
way it reads anyway it says that's how
 
01:05:28.589 --> 01:05:28.599 align:start position:0%
many we have outstanding in March it
 
01:05:30.390 --> 01:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
looks like could this be a rolling
 
01:05:31.789 --> 01:05:31.799 align:start position:0%
number and actually over the course of a
 
01:05:34.230 --> 01:05:34.240 align:start position:0%
year be much
 
01:05:37.269 --> 01:05:37.279 align:start position:0%
higher it could um children enter and
 
01:05:40.630 --> 01:05:40.640 align:start position:0%
exit Care at different times um so the
 
01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
data that we have at hand um before us
 
01:05:45.670 --> 01:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
is not easy to separate out and and this
 
01:05:47.109 --> 01:05:47.119 align:start position:0%
is unfortunate because we've tried to
 
01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
gather this data but it the way in which
 
01:05:50.789 --> 01:05:50.799 align:start position:0%
the system works is not easy to separate
 
01:05:53.309 --> 01:05:53.319 align:start position:0%
out how many of those placements for
 
01:05:55.750 --> 01:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
children Residential Care are first time
 
01:05:57.710 --> 01:05:57.720 align:start position:0%
placements because we also have children
 
01:06:00.069 --> 01:06:00.079 align:start position:0%
who may have been in residential care
 
01:06:01.750 --> 01:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
attempted to transition to another
 
01:06:03.430 --> 01:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
placement returned back to residential
 
01:06:06.309 --> 01:06:06.319 align:start position:0%
care so those numbers are shifting so
 
01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
regularly that it is hard to track and
 
01:06:10.470 --> 01:06:10.480 align:start position:0%
the way that the the current data system
 
01:06:12.829 --> 01:06:12.839 align:start position:0%
works within DCF it doesn't allow to
 
01:06:14.950 --> 01:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
pull very clean data in that way you
 
01:06:15.990 --> 01:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
could do that for all children in
 
01:06:17.549 --> 01:06:17.559 align:start position:0%
placement but you cannot separate out
 
01:06:20.190 --> 01:06:20.200 align:start position:0%
specifically children a firsttime
 
01:06:22.789 --> 01:06:22.799 align:start position:0%
placement in residential care uh but at
 
01:06:24.269 --> 01:06:24.279 align:start position:0%
the same time there's also the children
 
01:06:26.870 --> 01:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
that will transition out of that care
 
01:06:29.470 --> 01:06:29.480 align:start position:0%
for reunification which should be
 
01:06:32.069 --> 01:06:32.079 align:start position:0%
occurring in a year time frame so we yes
 
01:06:34.990 --> 01:06:35.000 align:start position:0%
this is a point in time glimpse of
 
01:06:37.950 --> 01:06:37.960 align:start position:0%
124 but from one month to the next that
 
01:06:39.470 --> 01:06:39.480 align:start position:0%
could be the same children and it may
 
01:06:40.990 --> 01:06:41.000 align:start position:0%
take six months for new children to
 
01:06:42.870 --> 01:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
enter and end up in residential care
 
01:06:44.109 --> 01:06:44.119 align:start position:0%
there's no way to get that that
 
01:06:46.230 --> 01:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
clear-cut number so we are pointing to
 
01:06:48.829 --> 01:06:48.839 align:start position:0%
124 but recognizing that it is going to
 
01:06:52.269 --> 01:06:52.279 align:start position:0%
be higher than that number but also that
 
01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:54.520 align:start position:0%
number has stayed pretty consistent we
 
01:06:56.549 --> 01:06:56.559 align:start position:0%
started working on this so with with
 
01:06:59.430 --> 01:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
this committee last summer and
 
01:07:01.470 --> 01:07:01.480 align:start position:0%
consistently month over month that
 
01:07:05.390 --> 01:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
number has hovered between 115 and 125
 
01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:06.630 align:start position:0%
number has hovered between 115 and 125
every

01:07:06.630 --> 01:07:06.640 align:start position:0%
every
 
01:07:10.029 --> 01:07:10.039 align:start position:0%
month okay thank you may I while we're
 
01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:13.039 align:start position:0%
right on that page and line top of line
 
01:07:15.829 --> 01:07:15.839 align:start position:0%
three of the handout there were 124
 
01:07:18.990 --> 01:07:19.000 align:start position:0%
children so that would be 124 attorneys
 
01:07:20.750 --> 01:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
that is assuming a one-on-one that's
 
01:07:22.950 --> 01:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
what you have written here what you mean
 
01:07:26.150 --> 01:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
to say I think is there would be 20
 
01:07:30.069 --> 01:07:30.079 align:start position:0%
124 attorney assignments correct yes as
 
01:07:32.510 --> 01:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
I stated before usually an attorney's
 
01:07:35.789 --> 01:07:35.799 align:start position:0%
carrying a case load of you know half a
 
01:07:38.910 --> 01:07:38.920 align:start position:0%
dozen to a dozen or more of those cases
 
01:07:41.470 --> 01:07:41.480 align:start position:0%
so we should under understand the second
 
01:07:44.549 --> 01:07:44.559 align:start position:0%
line in that light yes thank you for for
 
01:07:47.029 --> 01:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
catching that yes that is assignments
 
01:07:48.630 --> 01:07:48.640 align:start position:0%
training you to think like a lawyer you
 
01:07:50.870 --> 01:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
know that it's not an annual number
 
01:07:53.670 --> 01:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
that's my concern
 
01:07:56.190 --> 01:07:56.200 align:start position:0%
yeah so of M
 
01:07:58.430 --> 01:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
any other
 
01:08:00.950 --> 01:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
01:08:03.470 --> 01:08:03.480 align:start position:0%

group so first of all I actually want to
 
01:09:28.630 --> 01:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
thank you all for the commitment and
 
01:09:31.510 --> 01:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
work that you have done on this really
 
01:09:34.189 --> 01:09:34.199 align:start position:0%
important issue for children in our
 
01:09:36.349 --> 01:09:36.359 align:start position:0%
foster care system I mean you have
 
01:09:39.630 --> 01:09:39.640 align:start position:0%
started working on this over a year ago
 
01:09:43.590 --> 01:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
right you had HB 535 you um met you did
 
01:09:47.510 --> 01:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
a substantial overhaul really zeroing in
 
01:09:50.910 --> 01:09:50.920 align:start position:0%
on making sure that the state will
 
01:09:55.390 --> 01:09:55.400 align:start position:0%
provide Council for children in limited
 
01:09:57.229 --> 01:09:57.239 align:start position:0%
circumstances we're talking about a
 
01:09:58.870 --> 01:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
fraction of children who are in the
 
01:10:00.550 --> 01:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
child protection system but those are
 
01:10:03.870 --> 01:10:03.880 align:start position:0%
the children whose rights are just
 
01:10:06.070 --> 01:10:06.080 align:start position:0%
they're in grave circumstances
 
01:10:07.750 --> 01:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
statements of lavish praise will be
 
01:10:11.430 --> 01:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
limited to 10 minutes just saying well
 
01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
you all deserve it right you worked hard
 
01:10:17.669 --> 01:10:17.679 align:start position:0%
you you had um you know you you ordered
 
01:10:20.229 --> 01:10:20.239 align:start position:0%
us to work together you consider
 
01:10:22.990 --> 01:10:23.000 align:start position:0%
testimony from a lot of stakeholders in
 
01:10:25.990 --> 01:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
this area and we really thoughtful
 
01:10:31.149 --> 01:10:31.159 align:start position:0%
in um in amending 535 and ushering it so
 
01:10:34.390 --> 01:10:34.400 align:start position:0%
to its ultimate passage in this in in
 
01:10:37.189 --> 01:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
the house so I I just I mean I think
 
01:10:38.830 --> 01:10:38.840 align:start position:0%
this is just really important
 
01:10:42.630 --> 01:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
recognition so 463 is a bit different um
 
01:10:45.110 --> 01:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
but not a whole lot different and I
 
01:10:48.070 --> 01:10:48.080 align:start position:0%
think that um you know we had members of
 
01:10:50.070 --> 01:10:50.080 align:start position:0%
the ju I'm going to call us the jrpg
 
01:10:52.030 --> 01:10:52.040 align:start position:0%
okay the juvenal Reform py Group we had
 
01:10:54.590 --> 01:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
some more time to reflect on what we
 
01:10:57.510 --> 01:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
were hoping to accomplish and that is
 
01:11:00.910 --> 01:11:00.920 align:start position:0%
why um for example the the description
 
01:11:03.430 --> 01:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
of the facilities how we refer to what
 
01:11:05.750 --> 01:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
facilities would be considered those
 
01:11:08.149 --> 01:11:08.159 align:start position:0%
Residential Group facilities is slightly
 
01:11:09.990 --> 01:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
different in the bill that's in front of
 
01:11:11.950 --> 01:11:11.960 align:start position:0%
you because what we realized is that
 
01:11:14.750 --> 01:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
although all of us intended to provide
 
01:11:17.270 --> 01:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
counsel for children who are in group
 
01:11:21.070 --> 01:11:21.080 align:start position:0%
and institutional placements that
 
01:11:24.070 --> 01:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
limiting um the description to only
 
01:11:28.189 --> 01:11:28.199 align:start position:0%
those in e25 I should pull up the actual
 
01:11:32.189 --> 01:11:32.199 align:start position:0%
statute it it it inadvertently omitted
 
01:11:36.229 --> 01:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
um for example like hamad's um hospitals
 
01:11:38.910 --> 01:11:38.920 align:start position:0%
residential treatment program or it
 
01:11:41.629 --> 01:11:41.639 align:start position:0%
inadvertently eliminated um programs
 
01:11:43.669 --> 01:11:43.679 align:start position:0%
that are out of state where they may be
 
01:11:46.470 --> 01:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
certified and not licensed so we have a
 
01:11:50.030 --> 01:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
little bit more time um to perfect this
 
01:11:52.669 --> 01:11:52.679 align:start position:0%
a bit more so that's that is the you
 
01:11:54.030 --> 01:11:54.040 align:start position:0%
know that's a that's a that's a
 
01:11:56.830 --> 01:11:56.840 align:start position:0%
difference here another difference is
 
01:12:00.669 --> 01:12:00.679 align:start position:0%
that um as I think um Cassandra or Lisa
 
01:12:01.709 --> 01:12:01.719 align:start position:0%
may have mentioned from the office of
 
01:12:04.510 --> 01:12:04.520 align:start position:0%
the child advocate this bill really
 
01:12:07.030 --> 01:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
recognizes the strong
 
01:12:09.470 --> 01:12:09.480 align:start position:0%
collaboration um that children the
 
01:12:11.189 --> 01:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
courts and that these parent attorneys
 
01:12:13.510 --> 01:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
will have with Casa because Casa is
 
01:12:16.510 --> 01:12:16.520 align:start position:0%
really important in these cases they are
 
01:12:18.790 --> 01:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
weighing in on the best interest of the
 
01:12:21.470 --> 01:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
child in the opinion of their volunteers
 
01:12:24.030 --> 01:12:24.040 align:start position:0%
they are um forming lasting
 
01:12:25.310 --> 01:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
relationships with some of these
 
01:12:26.990 --> 01:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
children and so we felt it was important
 
01:12:29.790 --> 01:12:29.800 align:start position:0%
to recognize that one other thing that
 
01:12:32.390 --> 01:12:32.400 align:start position:0%
happened as this bill made its way
 
01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
through the Senate um and wait I forgot
 
01:12:36.590 --> 01:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
one other thing I wanted to thank
 
01:12:38.430 --> 01:12:38.440 align:start position:0%
chairman Pearson and representative ball
 
01:12:40.310 --> 01:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
for co-sponsoring this bill because
 
01:12:43.390 --> 01:12:43.400 align:start position:0%
that's another important thing to note
 
01:12:45.149 --> 01:12:45.159 align:start position:0%
um because you did you unlike the rest
 
01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
of this committee you had an opportunity
 
01:12:50.270 --> 01:12:50.280 align:start position:0%
to um look at the revisions that were
 
01:12:52.470 --> 01:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
you know between the two bills so what
 
01:12:54.510 --> 01:12:54.520 align:start position:0%
happened as it went through this process
 
01:12:57.110 --> 01:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
is that there was an appropriation that
 
01:13:00.229 --> 01:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
was added to it for the next fiscal year
 
01:13:03.430 --> 01:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
that um was in recognition of some um
 
01:13:05.070 --> 01:13:05.080 align:start position:0%
staff members that the department felt
 
01:13:06.590 --> 01:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
that they really needed to add to
 
01:13:09.750 --> 01:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
effectuate the bill and then it also
 
01:13:12.189 --> 01:13:12.199 align:start position:0%
postponed the effective date of this
 
01:13:16.390 --> 01:13:16.400 align:start position:0%
bill so origin in HB 535 and in the
 
01:13:17.950 --> 01:13:17.960 align:start position:0%
original version of this the bill would
 
01:13:21.189 --> 01:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
have been effective January of 2025 so
 
01:13:23.149 --> 01:13:23.159 align:start position:0%
this postpones the effective date to
 
01:13:25.310 --> 01:13:25.320 align:start position:0%
July you know more than a year for from
 
01:13:27.990 --> 01:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
now and I think that in doing so it does
 
01:13:30.750 --> 01:13:30.760 align:start position:0%
two things perhaps in these times when
 
01:13:32.110 --> 01:13:32.120 align:start position:0%
we're still get trying to get a hand on
 
01:13:33.870 --> 01:13:33.880 align:start position:0%
handle on the budget it allows some more
 
01:13:36.270 --> 01:13:36.280 align:start position:0%
time for that but it also allows much
 
01:13:39.110 --> 01:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
more time to gear up to recruit and
 
01:13:41.070 --> 01:13:41.080 align:start position:0%
train the attorneys who will be
 
01:13:44.510 --> 01:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
representing these children and to your
 
01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
question about how many attorneys I mean
 
01:13:49.470 --> 01:13:49.480 align:start position:0%
it's hard to predict exactly but when
 
01:13:51.590 --> 01:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
you look at like a full-time equivalent
 
01:13:52.830 --> 01:13:52.840 align:start position:0%
I don't think many attorneys will be
 
01:13:55.110 --> 01:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
taking these cases on as their full-time
 
01:13:57.430 --> 01:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
only job but a full-time attorney
 
01:13:59.030 --> 01:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
depending on the kinds of cases they
 
01:14:03.149 --> 01:14:03.159 align:start position:0%
have could easily have 25 40 cases that
 
01:14:05.550 --> 01:14:05.560 align:start position:0%
they're handling at any given time we
 
01:14:07.229 --> 01:14:07.239 align:start position:0%
know that unfortunately our public
 
01:14:09.709 --> 01:14:09.719 align:start position:0%
defenders handle at least twice that
 
01:14:13.270 --> 01:14:13.280 align:start position:0%
many cases so if you even kind of bid
 
01:14:15.149 --> 01:14:15.159 align:start position:0%
high and think about well maybe this
 
01:14:18.910 --> 01:14:18.920 align:start position:0%
number goes up to 160 that's four FTE
 
01:14:21.629 --> 01:14:21.639 align:start position:0%
it's not a lot of attorneys that we need
 
01:14:24.070 --> 01:14:24.080 align:start position:0%
to do this but we will have some time
 
01:14:26.430 --> 01:14:26.440 align:start position:0%
and you've got some really invested
 
01:14:28.910 --> 01:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
stakeholders here um you'll hear from
 
01:14:31.030 --> 01:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
one who is ready and willing and able to
 
01:14:32.709 --> 01:14:32.719 align:start position:0%
start doing some training and then
 
01:14:34.550 --> 01:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
you've got a commitment from my
 
01:14:36.350 --> 01:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
organization and others to do our best
 
01:14:38.030 --> 01:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
to come up with some creative ways to
 
01:14:39.870 --> 01:14:39.880 align:start position:0%
recruit attorneys we think these are
 
01:14:41.430 --> 01:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
cases that attorneys are going to want
 
01:14:45.790 --> 01:14:45.800 align:start position:0%
to do so um I I think that's I mean I'm
 
01:14:48.629 --> 01:14:48.639 align:start position:0%
happy to answer questions you might have
 
01:14:50.550 --> 01:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
um if you you know if you want more
 
01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
information but honestly I think that
 
01:14:54.590 --> 01:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
either either one of these bills would
 
01:14:57.510 --> 01:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
be a huge step forward for some children
 
01:14:59.510 --> 01:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
who are in the court system through no
 
01:15:02.030 --> 01:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
fault of their own but who are in really
 
01:15:05.470 --> 01:15:05.480 align:start position:0%
dire circumstances and are at risk of
 
01:15:08.870 --> 01:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
really having a very fundamental right
 
01:15:11.270 --> 01:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
like where they live who they associate
 
01:15:14.030 --> 01:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
with where they go to school taken away
 
01:15:16.870 --> 01:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
from them so thank you so much for your
 
01:15:21.870 --> 01:15:21.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:25.070 --> 01:15:25.080 align:start position:0%

committee for the record my name is John

Williams I'm the director of legislative
 
01:16:02.229 --> 01:16:02.239 align:start position:0%
affairs for the New Hampshire Department
 
01:16:04.229 --> 01:16:04.239 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services and it's in
 
01:16:05.790 --> 01:16:05.800 align:start position:0%
that capacity that I'm here before this
 
01:16:07.750 --> 01:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
committee today although the department
 
01:16:09.310 --> 01:16:09.320 align:start position:0%
is not taking a position on the bill
 
01:16:12.510 --> 01:16:12.520 align:start position:0%
clearly we are a very um interested
 
01:16:14.229 --> 01:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
stakeholder in this very important
 
01:16:16.430 --> 01:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
Venture and you've already done a really
 
01:16:17.950 --> 01:16:17.960 align:start position:0%
good job walking through the bill to do
 
01:16:21.310 --> 01:16:21.320 align:start position:0%
the crosswalk between Senate Bill 463
 
01:16:24.629 --> 01:16:24.639 align:start position:0%
and that involving HB 535 essentially
 
01:16:27.390 --> 01:16:27.400 align:start position:0%
this adds in section one a new purpose
 
01:16:29.350 --> 01:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
and intent section you clearly
 
01:16:31.870 --> 01:16:31.880 align:start position:0%
identified that the change that you saw
 
01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
in page two on lines uh 16 17 relative
 
01:16:37.470 --> 01:16:37.480 align:start position:0%
to certific certified facilities were
 
01:16:39.990 --> 01:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
added um that's a very minimal changes
 
01:16:41.709 --> 01:16:41.719 align:start position:0%
from the bill as you pass out of this
 
01:16:43.470 --> 01:16:43.480 align:start position:0%
committee additionally and it's
 
01:16:44.950 --> 01:16:44.960 align:start position:0%
important to note and I just wanted to
 
01:16:46.950 --> 01:16:46.960 align:start position:0%
put a couple of things on on the record
 
01:16:49.790 --> 01:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
for for some level of clarity it is true
 
01:16:51.430 --> 01:16:51.440 align:start position:0%
that the effective dates for both of the
 
01:16:53.470 --> 01:16:53.480 align:start position:0%
bills is July 1st
 
01:16:56.350 --> 01:16:56.360 align:start position:0%
2025 that means that whatever is being
 
01:16:57.830 --> 01:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
done here in terms of necessary
 
01:17:00.270 --> 01:17:00.280 align:start position:0%
resources for the department and also I
 
01:17:02.030 --> 01:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
understand the judicial branch also is
 
01:17:03.430 --> 01:17:03.440 align:start position:0%
here and may provide some level of
 
01:17:05.629 --> 01:17:05.639 align:start position:0%
commentary that there is an opportunity
 
01:17:08.110 --> 01:17:08.120 align:start position:0%
as part of the 2627 budget to build in
 
01:17:10.229 --> 01:17:10.239 align:start position:0%
those necessary resources when we were
 
01:17:11.830 --> 01:17:11.840 align:start position:0%
before the senate committee they heard
 
01:17:14.510 --> 01:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
our voice and they acknowledge and our
 
01:17:17.830 --> 01:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
concerns regarding the need for Staffing
 
01:17:20.350 --> 01:17:20.360 align:start position:0%
uh including five attorney positions and
 
01:17:23.070 --> 01:17:23.080 align:start position:0%
then a designated a number of the uh
 
01:17:26.070 --> 01:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
positions for cpsws of otherwise known
 
01:17:28.470 --> 01:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
as the child uh Protective Service
 
01:17:31.270 --> 01:17:31.280 align:start position:0%
workers um there was uh one thing that I
 
01:17:33.990 --> 01:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
do want to make note of on page three of
 
01:17:35.830 --> 01:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
the bill as I'm referencing your
 
01:17:38.590 --> 01:17:38.600 align:start position:0%
attention to section three that section
 
01:17:41.350 --> 01:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
three is identical to the provisions
 
01:17:43.030 --> 01:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
that amends the children's Bill of
 
01:17:45.390 --> 01:17:45.400 align:start position:0%
Rights and I just need to go on the
 
01:17:47.669 --> 01:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
record very clearly stating that this is
 
01:17:49.790 --> 01:17:49.800 align:start position:0%
a very careful balancing act that must
 
01:17:51.709 --> 01:17:51.719 align:start position:0%
occur it is very important for these
 
01:17:54.270 --> 01:17:54.280 align:start position:0%
children to receive the information as
 
01:17:56.390 --> 01:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
to the access to councel and the right
 
01:17:58.910 --> 01:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
to do so but very carefully balanced
 
01:18:01.430 --> 01:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
against representational capacity the
 
01:18:02.910 --> 01:18:02.920 align:start position:0%
attorneys for the Department of heing
 
01:18:04.830 --> 01:18:04.840 align:start position:0%
Services represent the department they
 
01:18:06.590 --> 01:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
do not represent the individual interest
 
01:18:09.590 --> 01:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
of the children in these matters so the
 
01:18:11.189 --> 01:18:11.199 align:start position:0%
way it's currently worded and I just
 
01:18:13.590 --> 01:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
want to bring your attention to page
 
01:18:17.430 --> 01:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
three uh in in line six it talks about
 
01:18:19.310 --> 01:18:19.320 align:start position:0%
written statement of these rights and
 
01:18:21.870 --> 01:18:21.880 align:start position:0%
the process in which the request uh to
 
01:18:24.870 --> 01:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
request an attorney uh very clearly if
 
01:18:26.950 --> 01:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
Department's role is to provide that
 
01:18:29.189 --> 01:18:29.199 align:start position:0%
information we believe you're uh we're
 
01:18:30.950 --> 01:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
threading that needle very carefully not
 
01:18:33.390 --> 01:18:33.400 align:start position:0%
to cross the bridge between representing
 
01:18:34.669 --> 01:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
the department and representing the
 
01:18:36.910 --> 01:18:36.920 align:start position:0%
interests of the child it is very good
 
01:18:38.629 --> 01:18:38.639 align:start position:0%
that this legislation is effective on
 
01:18:42.189 --> 01:18:42.199 align:start position:0%
July 1st of 2023 uh 25 because it does
 
01:18:43.910 --> 01:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
allow us to work with the stakeholders
 
01:18:45.709 --> 01:18:45.719 align:start position:0%
on perhaps further refinement of this
 
01:18:48.070 --> 01:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
section uh it's our interpretation going
 
01:18:50.350 --> 01:18:50.360 align:start position:0%
on the record that this would not be a
 
01:18:52.229 --> 01:18:52.239 align:start position:0%
breach of that representational capacity
 
01:18:54.310 --> 01:18:54.320 align:start position:0%
and that we're just merely providing per
 
01:18:56.550 --> 01:18:56.560 align:start position:0%
the law the written statement of that
 
01:18:58.310 --> 01:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
right and some level of written
 
01:19:01.030 --> 01:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
Direction on how they could access it uh
 
01:19:03.149 --> 01:19:03.159 align:start position:0%
great questions were asked I believe rep
 
01:19:05.510 --> 01:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
of Nelson uh and getting into the weeds
 
01:19:07.430 --> 01:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
a bit in terms of how do you address it
 
01:19:08.669 --> 01:19:08.679 align:start position:0%
with children who might have
 
01:19:10.910 --> 01:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
communication needs that requires some
 
01:19:12.830 --> 01:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
level uh those are additional issues
 
01:19:14.189 --> 01:19:14.199 align:start position:0%
that will need to be worked out moving
 
01:19:16.790 --> 01:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
forward because the current legislation
 
01:19:18.030 --> 01:19:18.040 align:start position:0%
just provides the Department's
 
01:19:19.790 --> 01:19:19.800 align:start position:0%
requirement is provide a written
 
01:19:21.629 --> 01:19:21.639 align:start position:0%
statement and also an explanation of
 
01:19:23.590 --> 01:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
that process it doesn't require any
 
01:19:26.709 --> 01:19:26.719 align:start position:0%
other level of uh communication uh there
 
01:19:28.550 --> 01:19:28.560 align:start position:0%
are I would represent to the committee
 
01:19:31.189 --> 01:19:31.199 align:start position:0%
though our department takes very um
 
01:19:33.270 --> 01:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
making very important the need for
 
01:19:35.189 --> 01:19:35.199 align:start position:0%
communication and in fact we have a
 
01:19:36.790 --> 01:19:36.800 align:start position:0%
complete communication protocol for
 
01:19:39.149 --> 01:19:39.159 align:start position:0%
individuals who English may be not their
 
01:19:41.030 --> 01:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
first primary language individuals who
 
01:19:44.390 --> 01:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
may have either hearing uh um impairment
 
01:19:46.149 --> 01:19:46.159 align:start position:0%
issues as well as those who may be
 
01:19:48.229 --> 01:19:48.239 align:start position:0%
non-verbal as was discussed by repres
 
01:19:50.110 --> 01:19:50.120 align:start position:0%
Nelson so I just wanted to go on the
 
01:19:51.790 --> 01:19:51.800 align:start position:0%
record really really clear on behalf of
 
01:19:53.310 --> 01:19:53.320 align:start position:0%
the department and our representation
 
01:19:54.990 --> 01:19:55.000 align:start position:0%
through the Department of Justice that
 
01:19:57.990 --> 01:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
we do not see this specific language as
 
01:20:00.350 --> 01:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
us breaching our representational
 
01:20:02.229 --> 01:20:02.239 align:start position:0%
capacity and providing that information
 
01:20:04.510 --> 01:20:04.520 align:start position:0%
and need to say that because others
 
01:20:06.310 --> 01:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
might have a very different opinion in
 
01:20:07.910 --> 01:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
terms of our participation in the
 
01:20:09.990 --> 01:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
process the other piece is in section
 
01:20:12.149 --> 01:20:12.159 align:start position:0%
four uh and it was alluded to in
 
01:20:15.149 --> 01:20:15.159 align:start position:0%
attorney maio's uh commentary uh that
 
01:20:17.950 --> 01:20:17.960 align:start position:0%
there is a dis uh disparity between the
 
01:20:20.870 --> 01:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal analysis on this bill Senate Bill
 
01:20:25.229 --> 01:20:25.239 align:start position:0%
463 and that done on House Bill four uh
 
01:20:28.390 --> 01:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
535 the um it the first thing I just
 
01:20:31.229 --> 01:20:31.239 align:start position:0%
want to bring on the this issue around
 
01:20:33.430 --> 01:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
the fiscal impact is if you look at the
 
01:20:35.110 --> 01:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
actual fisal mode on the back of the
 
01:20:36.790 --> 01:20:36.800 align:start position:0%
bill after you get past the effective
 
01:20:40.470 --> 01:20:40.480 align:start position:0%
date you'll notice that the um that the
 
01:20:43.070 --> 01:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
um fiscal analysis on this bill was done
 
01:20:45.430 --> 01:20:45.440 align:start position:0%
on the bill as introduced it was done on
 
01:20:47.950 --> 01:20:47.960 align:start position:0%
January 24th so this is a very very
 
01:20:50.030 --> 01:20:50.040 align:start position:0%
outdated fiscal analysis on the bill to
 
01:20:52.110 --> 01:20:52.120 align:start position:0%
begin with I was in direct communication
 
01:20:54.310 --> 01:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
with Mr Kevin Ripple he is the LBA
 
01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:55.390 align:start position:0%
with Mr Kevin Ripple he is the LBA
analyst

01:20:55.390 --> 01:20:55.400 align:start position:0%
analyst
 
01:20:57.030 --> 01:20:57.040 align:start position:0%
and he actually was hoping to have it
 
01:20:59.110 --> 01:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
turned around by today I was checking
 
01:21:00.750 --> 01:21:00.760 align:start position:0%
literally seconds before coming up and
 
01:21:03.030 --> 01:21:03.040 align:start position:0%
testifying it has not been updated but
 
01:21:05.149 --> 01:21:05.159 align:start position:0%
he is going to provide an updated fiscal
 
01:21:07.110 --> 01:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
analysis the
 
01:21:08.990 --> 01:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
$500,000 or the
 
01:21:12.149 --> 01:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
$58,000 represented in the appropriation
 
01:21:14.990 --> 01:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
in section 4 actually represents the
 
01:21:17.070 --> 01:21:17.080 align:start position:0%
general fund portion there is a federal
 
01:21:18.870 --> 01:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
match that comes with it to help offset
 
01:21:21.030 --> 01:21:21.040 align:start position:0%
the cost but the general fund portion
 
01:21:22.709 --> 01:21:22.719 align:start position:0%
for just the attorneys it does not
 
01:21:24.790 --> 01:21:24.800 align:start position:0%
represent the cost that it would be
 
01:21:27.110 --> 01:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
required for the 14 Child Protective
 
01:21:29.110 --> 01:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
Service workers if you take them into
 
01:21:30.870 --> 01:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
account you then come in complete
 
01:21:32.669 --> 01:21:32.679 align:start position:0%
alignment and you'll see that it is
 
01:21:34.310 --> 01:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
anticipated that you'll see Mr Ripple
 
01:21:36.790 --> 01:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
through the LPA will demonstrate that
 
01:21:39.189 --> 01:21:39.199 align:start position:0%
the cost will be approximately $1.5
 
01:21:41.070 --> 01:21:41.080 align:start position:0%
million General funds whether you're
 
01:21:44.350 --> 01:21:44.360 align:start position:0%
going uh through HB 535 or through this
 
01:21:47.189 --> 01:21:47.199 align:start position:0%
bill I only went into that level of
 
01:21:48.830 --> 01:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
detail because it was mentioned in a
 
01:21:50.590 --> 01:21:50.600 align:start position:0%
previous comment uh before this
 
01:21:52.310 --> 01:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
committee and I just wanted to clarify
 
01:21:54.830 --> 01:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
that information and with that and
 
01:21:57.270 --> 01:21:57.280 align:start position:0%
taking a deep breath uh that concludes
 
01:21:59.189 --> 01:21:59.199 align:start position:0%
my testimony and I am available to take
 
01:22:01.350 --> 01:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
questions on behalf of the
 
01:22:04.030 --> 01:22:04.040 align:start position:0%
department representative
 
01:22:07.149 --> 01:22:07.159 align:start position:0%
Bickford thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:22:10.189 --> 01:22:10.199 align:start position:0%
attorney Williams for coming I've been
 
01:22:11.350 --> 01:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
waiting for
 
01:22:15.110 --> 01:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
you um you got five staff attorneys here
 
01:22:17.750 --> 01:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh two and I'm not familiar with grades
 
01:22:20.709 --> 01:22:20.719 align:start position:0%
but how many do you have now why is five
 
01:22:21.709 --> 01:22:21.719 align:start position:0%
the right
 
01:22:23.830 --> 01:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
number I would need to get back to you
 
01:22:25.149 --> 01:22:25.159 align:start position:0%
on the exact number number of recurrent
 
01:22:26.990 --> 01:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
attorneys that we have but I would I
 
01:22:29.550 --> 01:22:29.560 align:start position:0%
would be um uh very clear to say that
 
01:22:31.669 --> 01:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
I'm sure we have quite what a few more
 
01:22:33.629 --> 01:22:33.639 align:start position:0%
than five attorneys for our current
 
01:22:35.870 --> 01:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
workload the reason why we need the
 
01:22:37.470 --> 01:22:37.480 align:start position:0%
additional five attorneys is because the
 
01:22:39.110 --> 01:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
bill does require something different
 
01:22:41.110 --> 01:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
and as represent ball pointed out on
 
01:22:43.189 --> 01:22:43.199 align:start position:0%
that additional language here and also
 
01:22:45.669 --> 01:22:45.679 align:start position:0%
represent McMahon the May which is under
 
01:22:47.110 --> 01:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
current law in terms of the best
 
01:22:48.229 --> 01:22:48.239 align:start position:0%
interest of the child and the court
 
01:22:50.470 --> 01:22:50.480 align:start position:0%
being able to do that there's a sh
 
01:22:52.430 --> 01:22:52.440 align:start position:0%
relative to a specific placement of a
 
01:22:55.149 --> 01:22:55.159 align:start position:0%
child in a um in the settings that are
 
01:22:57.270 --> 01:22:57.280 align:start position:0%
identified in the legislation and
 
01:22:58.790 --> 01:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
because of that and attorneys are
 
01:23:00.629 --> 01:23:00.639 align:start position:0%
wonderful they are absolutely wonderful
 
01:23:02.270 --> 01:23:02.280 align:start position:0%
in terms of the representation but if
 
01:23:04.229 --> 01:23:04.239 align:start position:0%
you do have an attorney appointed
 
01:23:06.430 --> 01:23:06.440 align:start position:0%
representing a child there is
 
01:23:08.669 --> 01:23:08.679 align:start position:0%
anticipated fairly that there's going to
 
01:23:10.350 --> 01:23:10.360 align:start position:0%
be additional work on the department
 
01:23:11.950 --> 01:23:11.960 align:start position:0%
side to address the legal concerns that
 
01:23:13.590 --> 01:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
are going to be raised by the child's
 
01:23:15.310 --> 01:23:15.320 align:start position:0%
attorney in addition to that there'll
 
01:23:17.629 --> 01:23:17.639 align:start position:0%
have to be investigations and also
 
01:23:19.350 --> 01:23:19.360 align:start position:0%
additional information provided and
 
01:23:21.149 --> 01:23:21.159 align:start position:0%
therefore we'd need the additional
 
01:23:23.310 --> 01:23:23.320 align:start position:0%
workload is for supporting uh Child
 
01:23:25.310 --> 01:23:25.320 align:start position:0%
Protective Service workers as as well
 
01:23:26.750 --> 01:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
and that's where the Department's
 
01:23:28.709 --> 01:23:28.719 align:start position:0%
financial analysis comes the the Senate
 
01:23:31.510 --> 01:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
heard this and they uh agreed and
 
01:23:32.990 --> 01:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
provided us with an appropriation at
 
01:23:36.110 --> 01:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
least for the attorney positions uh and
 
01:23:38.870 --> 01:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
the that was um the $500,000 reflected
 
01:23:41.590 --> 01:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
here that's not the total amount and um
 
01:23:43.390 --> 01:23:43.400 align:start position:0%
and it was the Department's failure to
 
01:23:44.990 --> 01:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
identify that additional amount on the
 
01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:46.910 align:start position:0%
identify that additional amount on the
prior

01:23:46.910 --> 01:23:46.920 align:start position:0%
prior
 
01:23:50.149 --> 01:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
Amendment followup thank you Mr
 
01:23:52.629 --> 01:23:52.639 align:start position:0%
chairman um so it sounds like you're
 
01:23:55.030 --> 01:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
doubling the the attorney staff oh
 
01:23:56.870 --> 01:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
nowhere near that I I will get back to
 
01:23:59.550 --> 01:23:59.560 align:start position:0%
to the committee with the exact number
 
01:24:01.550 --> 01:24:01.560 align:start position:0%
uh for uh staff but it's nowhere near
 
01:24:03.629 --> 01:24:03.639 align:start position:0%
doubling the staff that we have I I'd be
 
01:24:05.910 --> 01:24:05.920 align:start position:0%
curious to know more about the
 
01:24:09.870 --> 01:24:09.880 align:start position:0%
organization and one other thing I based
 
01:24:11.270 --> 01:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
on the information we got from the child
 
01:24:15.030 --> 01:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
advocate of 124 that was an in camera
 
01:24:17.510 --> 01:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
look it said as of my bingo this is what
 
01:24:19.750 --> 01:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
we got but I would think the numbers
 
01:24:21.149 --> 01:24:21.159 align:start position:0%
would change one would be taken care of
 
01:24:22.310 --> 01:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
then another one comes in and then
 
01:24:23.910 --> 01:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
another one it could be much higher that
 
01:24:25.390 --> 01:24:25.400 align:start position:0%
at the end of the the year do you have
 
01:24:26.870 --> 01:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
any idea how much it would be in the
 
01:24:30.149 --> 01:24:30.159 align:start position:0%
course of a year um I do not but uh part
 
01:24:31.950 --> 01:24:31.960 align:start position:0%
of our analysis and the folks that did
 
01:24:33.669 --> 01:24:33.679 align:start position:0%
work on this and I was part of at Lisa
 
01:24:36.310 --> 01:24:36.320 align:start position:0%
with the overview of reviewing the
 
01:24:37.870 --> 01:24:37.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal analysis from the Department to
 
01:24:40.430 --> 01:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
the LBA um that these are rolling
 
01:24:42.430 --> 01:24:42.440 align:start position:0%
numbers that you're referring to um for
 
01:24:43.910 --> 01:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
the department but I I believe that the
 
01:24:45.870 --> 01:24:45.880 align:start position:0%
numbers represented by the office of
 
01:24:47.990 --> 01:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
child advocate were were uh the same
 
01:24:51.470 --> 01:24:51.480 align:start position:0%
numbers that we'd expect okay thank
 
01:24:54.350 --> 01:24:54.360 align:start position:0%
you representative Raymond uh thank
 
01:24:55.470 --> 01:24:55.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:24:58.590 --> 01:24:58.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question piggybacking off of
 
01:25:01.189 --> 01:25:01.199 align:start position:0%
um representative biber's questions if
 
01:25:03.830 --> 01:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
the numbers in this fiscal note are
 
01:25:07.910 --> 01:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
based on dcf's staff additional staff
 
01:25:10.790 --> 01:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
then where is the money coming from to
 
01:25:14.390 --> 01:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
pay these child attorneys right if it's
 
01:25:16.510 --> 01:25:16.520 align:start position:0%
not coming out of the the DCF
 
01:25:18.470 --> 01:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
appropriation so where is that coming
 
01:25:20.470 --> 01:25:20.480 align:start position:0%
from we're not I just want to be clear
 
01:25:22.030 --> 01:25:22.040 align:start position:0%
that we're not going to be charging
 
01:25:24.629 --> 01:25:24.639 align:start position:0%
parents for the attorneys that that the
 
01:25:24.639 --> 01:25:26.510 align:start position:0%
parents for the attorneys that that the
children

01:25:26.510 --> 01:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:25:29.510 --> 01:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
need and represent pearison uh sometimes
 
01:25:31.109 --> 01:25:31.119 align:start position:0%
when I'm sitting in the gallery I
 
01:25:33.030 --> 01:25:33.040 align:start position:0%
actually feel a gravitational poll when
 
01:25:35.510 --> 01:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
questions are asked of a of the
 
01:25:36.870 --> 01:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
department and I know I'm the right
 
01:25:38.709 --> 01:25:38.719 align:start position:0%
person to come up the question that
 
01:25:41.310 --> 01:25:41.320 align:start position:0%
you're you're posing actually involves
 
01:25:43.229 --> 01:25:43.239 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch I do know a member
 
01:25:46.070 --> 01:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
of the um um their uh General councel is
 
01:25:47.310 --> 01:25:47.320 align:start position:0%
available I don't know if a pink card
 
01:25:48.990 --> 01:25:49.000 align:start position:0%
was submitted but they could certainly
 
01:25:50.709 --> 01:25:50.719 align:start position:0%
explain to you how that would be funded
 
01:25:52.189 --> 01:25:52.199 align:start position:0%
through the judicial Council there is a
 
01:25:54.590 --> 01:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
funding process also theart dep
 
01:25:56.830 --> 01:25:56.840 align:start position:0%
recognizes in the very good works of
 
01:25:59.229 --> 01:25:59.239 align:start position:0%
this legislature here the works in the
 
01:26:01.390 --> 01:26:01.400 align:start position:0%
Senate that we actually worked in the
 
01:26:03.910 --> 01:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
past to remove what they called parental
 
01:26:06.550 --> 01:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
liability in the past we would charge uh
 
01:26:09.030 --> 01:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
the parents a portion of the amount of
 
01:26:11.229 --> 01:26:11.239 align:start position:0%
money for the treatments that the
 
01:26:13.550 --> 01:26:13.560 align:start position:0%
children would um receive and nowhere in
 
01:26:16.270 --> 01:26:16.280 align:start position:0%
this legislation is it contemplated that
 
01:26:18.030 --> 01:26:18.040 align:start position:0%
the parents would be responsible for
 
01:26:21.189 --> 01:26:21.199 align:start position:0%
having to repay the attorney's fees for
 
01:26:22.669 --> 01:26:22.679 align:start position:0%
those um attorneys that would be
 
01:26:25.310 --> 01:26:25.320 align:start position:0%
appointed therefore those would be a
 
01:26:26.910 --> 01:26:26.920 align:start position:0%
cost to the state I would leave it to
 
01:26:28.669 --> 01:26:28.679 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch to respond to those
 
01:26:32.310 --> 01:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:34.750 --> 01:26:34.760 align:start position:0%
you seeing no further questions thank
 
01:26:37.430 --> 01:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
you very much and thank you very much
 
01:26:40.030 --> 01:26:40.040 align:start position:0%
and uh we're running a little bit over
 
01:26:41.870 --> 01:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
and we have two pink cards so I would
 
01:26:44.590 --> 01:26:44.600 align:start position:0%
ask the last two people to be brief

morning my name is Lisa Wolford I am a
 
01:27:16.310 --> 01:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
lawyer and the executive director of the
 
01:27:18.550 --> 01:27:18.560 align:start position:0%
children's Law Center of New Hampshire
 
01:27:21.149 --> 01:27:21.159 align:start position:0%
we are a legal services nonprofit
 
01:27:23.109 --> 01:27:23.119 align:start position:0%
dedicated to the legal interests of
 
01:27:27.070 --> 01:27:27.080 align:start position:0%
children and we do the work that uh SB
 
01:27:29.950 --> 01:27:29.960 align:start position:0%
463 contemplates we represent children
 
01:27:31.870 --> 01:27:31.880 align:start position:0%
in abuse and neglect proceedings under
 
01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:33.390 align:start position:0%
in abuse and neglect proceedings under
RSA

01:27:33.390 --> 01:27:33.400 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
01:27:36.669 --> 01:27:36.679 align:start position:0%
169c the child protection act I've
 
01:27:39.109 --> 01:27:39.119 align:start position:0%
provided written testimony um that
 
01:27:42.510 --> 01:27:42.520 align:start position:0%
describes the many legal rights that um
 
01:27:45.310 --> 01:27:45.320 align:start position:0%
the legislature has uh afforded children
 
01:27:49.189 --> 01:27:49.199 align:start position:0%
in 169c cases and I want to just focus
 
01:27:52.070 --> 01:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
on three points um during my testimony
 
01:27:54.350 --> 01:27:54.360 align:start position:0%
this morning the first is that the State
 
01:27:56.550 --> 01:27:56.560 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire over relies on
 
01:27:59.149 --> 01:27:59.159 align:start position:0%
institutional placement for children
 
01:28:01.790 --> 01:28:01.800 align:start position:0%
despite evidence indicating that
 
01:28:03.830 --> 01:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
institutional placement produces bad
 
01:28:07.510 --> 01:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
outcomes for kids and therefore also for
 
01:28:10.709 --> 01:28:10.719 align:start position:0%
society and despite the exorbitant cost
 
01:28:13.750 --> 01:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
of institutional placement that about
 
01:28:17.310 --> 01:28:17.320 align:start position:0%
26% of children in state care are placed
 
01:28:21.109 --> 01:28:21.119 align:start position:0%
by DHHS and our courts in Institutions
 
01:28:23.229 --> 01:28:23.239 align:start position:0%
and that is one of the worst if not the
 
01:28:25.030 --> 01:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
worst Records On on institutional
 
01:28:28.149 --> 01:28:28.159 align:start position:0%
placement uh in the country children's
 
01:28:30.109 --> 01:28:30.119 align:start position:0%
legal rights are currently all but
 
01:28:33.590 --> 01:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
invisible in 169c proceedings um and
 
01:28:36.870 --> 01:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
lawyers for kids will make a difference
 
01:28:38.910 --> 01:28:38.920 align:start position:0%
um to focus just for a moment on the
 
01:28:41.070 --> 01:28:41.080 align:start position:0%
types of advocacy lawyers can provide
 
01:28:43.910 --> 01:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
for children uh with regard to
 
01:28:45.870 --> 01:28:45.880 align:start position:0%
institutionalization for kids at high
 
01:28:49.229 --> 01:28:49.239 align:start position:0%
risk of institutional placement lawyers
 
01:28:51.629 --> 01:28:51.639 align:start position:0%
will Advocate that the child and his or
 
01:28:54.109 --> 01:28:54.119 align:start position:0%
her family have access to community
 
01:28:56.830 --> 01:28:56.840 align:start position:0%
based counseling mentorship and in Home
 
01:28:59.350 --> 01:28:59.360 align:start position:0%
Services uh that respit care is
 
01:29:02.550 --> 01:29:02.560 align:start position:0%
available if uh necessary that adult
 
01:29:05.189 --> 01:29:05.199 align:start position:0%
mentorship for the child is available
 
01:29:08.310 --> 01:29:08.320 align:start position:0%
that dcyf complies with the foster care
 
01:29:11.270 --> 01:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
children's Bill of Rights um that the
 
01:29:14.709 --> 01:29:14.719 align:start position:0%
toxic effects of poverty are offset by
 
01:29:17.709 --> 01:29:17.719 align:start position:0%
available federal state and Community
 
01:29:21.310 --> 01:29:21.320 align:start position:0%
financial assistance um that prior to
 
01:29:24.430 --> 01:29:24.440 align:start position:0%
placement at an institution DCF the
 
01:29:26.870 --> 01:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
child school district and the court
 
01:29:29.669 --> 01:29:29.679 align:start position:0%
comply with the law concerning the due
 
01:29:32.390 --> 01:29:32.400 align:start position:0%
diligence that must be engaged in
 
01:29:36.149 --> 01:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
regarding the child's access to special
 
01:29:38.109 --> 01:29:38.119 align:start position:0%
education most of these children have
 
01:29:40.550 --> 01:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
special education needs and frequently
 
01:29:42.709 --> 01:29:42.719 align:start position:0%
when they are placed in institutions we
 
01:29:45.910 --> 01:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
see that they are not afforded what the
 
01:29:48.510 --> 01:29:48.520 align:start position:0%
what federal and state law uh entitles
 
01:29:49.750 --> 01:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
you have one and a half minutes to
 
01:29:53.550 --> 01:29:53.560 align:start position:0%
conclude please okay um the the last
 
01:29:55.550 --> 01:29:55.560 align:start position:0%
point um I will make is that the
 
01:29:57.390 --> 01:29:57.400 align:start position:0%
children's Law Center has begun to
 
01:30:00.709 --> 01:30:00.719 align:start position:0%
implement a plan to train lawyers um and
 
01:30:04.070 --> 01:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
assist in the process of recruiting them
 
01:30:06.830 --> 01:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
you heard earlier that the judicial
 
01:30:09.750 --> 01:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
Council was working on standards for the
 
01:30:13.030 --> 01:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
representation of children um I was
 
01:30:15.030 --> 01:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
involved in that effort Michelle weran
 
01:30:16.830 --> 01:30:16.840 align:start position:0%
at the at New Hampshire legal assistance
 
01:30:19.310 --> 01:30:19.320 align:start position:0%
was also involved in that effort and the
 
01:30:21.550 --> 01:30:21.560 align:start position:0%
judicial Council on Friday adopted
 
01:30:23.550 --> 01:30:23.560 align:start position:0%
standards relative to the representation
 
01:30:29.910 --> 01:30:29.920 align:start position:0%
of kids in 169c uh cases um we have done
 
01:30:32.350 --> 01:30:32.360 align:start position:0%
quite a lot of Outreach to law firms we
 
01:30:35.030 --> 01:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
know that lawyers in private practice
 
01:30:36.990 --> 01:30:37.000 align:start position:0%
are interested in these cases and in
 
01:30:40.229 --> 01:30:40.239 align:start position:0%
fact have recruited prono lawyers to do
 
01:30:42.950 --> 01:30:42.960 align:start position:0%

01:30:47.149 --> 01:30:47.159 align:start position:0%
us on those things um I uh will work
 
01:30:48.910 --> 01:30:48.920 align:start position:0%
with the judicial councel and other
 
01:30:51.070 --> 01:30:51.080 align:start position:0%
interested stakeholders to provide
 
01:30:53.590 --> 01:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
trainings for these lawyers and I have
 
01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:54.470 align:start position:0%

01:31:01.629 --> 01:31:01.639 align:start position:0%
collaborate with us uh despite their
 
01:31:04.550 --> 01:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
reservations um over the next year in
 
01:31:08.669 --> 01:31:08.679 align:start position:0%
ensuring that there is ample uh an ample
 
01:31:11.270 --> 01:31:11.280 align:start position:0%
supply of attorneys who are trained to
 
01:31:15.470 --> 01:31:15.480 align:start position:0%
represent kids in these cases any
 
01:31:17.709 --> 01:31:17.719 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
01:31:20.550 --> 01:31:20.560 align:start position:0%

01:31:27.189 --> 01:31:27.199 align:start position:0%
their pink cards well in advance and not
 
01:31:30.189 --> 01:31:30.199 align:start position:0%
at the last minute the chair recognizes
 
01:31:41.310 --> 01:31:41.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:43.590 --> 01:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
minutes good morning honorable chair and
 
01:31:44.830 --> 01:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
members of the committee this is my
 
01:31:46.990 --> 01:31:47.000 align:start position:0%
daughter Sarah Wen who she's having a
 
01:31:49.550 --> 01:31:49.560 align:start position:0%
wonderful Comming effect on the audience
 
01:31:51.790 --> 01:31:51.800 align:start position:0%
they're usually not very well behaved so
 
01:31:53.950 --> 01:31:53.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for modeling she is wonderful
 
01:31:55.590 --> 01:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
you should see her her notes that she's
 
01:31:57.149 --> 01:31:57.159 align:start position:0%
been taking about the importance of
 
01:32:00.750 --> 01:32:00.760 align:start position:0%
legisl legislative work I am impressed
 
01:32:02.950 --> 01:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
um but I'm here to testify in strong
 
01:32:06.070 --> 01:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
support of s SP 463 um we think that
 
01:32:09.350 --> 01:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
this is an incredibly important right um
 
01:32:10.830 --> 01:32:10.840 align:start position:0%
for for for children and I think it
 
01:32:13.070 --> 01:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
needs to be recognized as such when
 
01:32:15.270 --> 01:32:15.280 align:start position:0%
children are in abuse and neglect cases
 
01:32:17.229 --> 01:32:17.239 align:start position:0%
and at risk of institutional placement
 
01:32:20.030 --> 01:32:20.040 align:start position:0%
not only are they at risk of losing
 
01:32:21.870 --> 01:32:21.880 align:start position:0%
their familial Association but they're
 
01:32:24.310 --> 01:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
also even more at risk than I say their
 
01:32:26.590 --> 01:32:26.600 align:start position:0%
parents are because they're also at risk
 
01:32:28.229 --> 01:32:28.239 align:start position:0%
of loss of Liberty if they go to
 
01:32:30.470 --> 01:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
institutional placement and so I think
 
01:32:32.510 --> 01:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
it's incred incredibly important to
 
01:32:33.950 --> 01:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
recognize that if this right is
 
01:32:36.550 --> 01:32:36.560 align:start position:0%
established it needs to be a right that
 
01:32:39.910 --> 01:32:39.920 align:start position:0%
means something and that truly does
 
01:32:42.709 --> 01:32:42.719 align:start position:0%
enable them to access Council uh when
 
01:32:45.109 --> 01:32:45.119 align:start position:0%
that council is needed um I just wanted
 
01:32:47.910 --> 01:32:47.920 align:start position:0%
to make a couple of points on the um the
 
01:32:49.270 --> 01:32:49.280 align:start position:0%
amended fiscal note that I think is
 
01:32:52.830 --> 01:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
coming down the pike um for
 
01:32:54.950 --> 01:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
one the fiscal note in this case
 
01:32:56.430 --> 01:32:56.440 align:start position:0%
indicates that the department would need
 
01:32:58.950 --> 01:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
five attorneys to do this work I share
 
01:33:00.990 --> 01:33:01.000 align:start position:0%
the concern that five attorneys seems
 
01:33:03.709 --> 01:33:03.719 align:start position:0%
like a lot for the Department to need
 
01:33:05.709 --> 01:33:05.719 align:start position:0%
when it's unclear if that's even the
 
01:33:08.109 --> 01:33:08.119 align:start position:0%
number that children will need for this
 
01:33:10.629 --> 01:33:10.639 align:start position:0%
representation it very well could be but
 
01:33:12.189 --> 01:33:12.199 align:start position:0%
it's important to recognize that the
 
01:33:14.350 --> 01:33:14.360 align:start position:0%
Department's attorneys are already
 
01:33:16.189 --> 01:33:16.199 align:start position:0%
providing representation to the
 
01:33:17.990 --> 01:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
department making sure that the
 
01:33:20.350 --> 01:33:20.360 align:start position:0%
department is following the procedures
 
01:33:22.070 --> 01:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
and the policies that are established
 
01:33:24.870 --> 01:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
for them um are you that they are
 
01:33:26.470 --> 01:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
following the policies that are
 
01:33:28.870 --> 01:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
established to make sure that children
 
01:33:31.830 --> 01:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
are only removed when they need to be
 
01:33:34.350 --> 01:33:34.360 align:start position:0%
removed that children are already placed
 
01:33:36.030 --> 01:33:36.040 align:start position:0%
in placements that are the least
 
01:33:38.229 --> 01:33:38.239 align:start position:0%
restrictive available available to them
 
01:33:40.470 --> 01:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
sure there will be some additional legal
 
01:33:42.750 --> 01:33:42.760 align:start position:0%
arguments but those legal arguments will
 
01:33:44.950 --> 01:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
most likely be made when the department
 
01:33:46.750 --> 01:33:46.760 align:start position:0%
is not following its established
 
01:33:48.470 --> 01:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
policies to make sure that the children
 
01:33:50.430 --> 01:33:50.440 align:start position:0%
are institutional in institutional
 
01:33:53.229 --> 01:33:53.239 align:start position:0%
placements half a minute okay half a
 
01:33:56.950 --> 01:33:56.960 align:start position:0%
minute second the um the new request for
 
01:33:59.350 --> 01:33:59.360 align:start position:0%
for 12 csws I think that was something
 
01:34:02.030 --> 01:34:02.040 align:start position:0%
that was brought in the Senate as well
 
01:34:04.030 --> 01:34:04.040 align:start position:0%
and attorney laraby testified at the
 
01:34:06.790 --> 01:34:06.800 align:start position:0%
time that that need was to inform the
 
01:34:08.590 --> 01:34:08.600 align:start position:0%
children of their rights and to inform
 
01:34:11.070 --> 01:34:11.080 align:start position:0%
them of the process for doing so I fail
 
01:34:12.870 --> 01:34:12.880 align:start position:0%
to see when there is already a
 
01:34:15.470 --> 01:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
children's Bill of Rights that um that
 
01:34:17.350 --> 01:34:17.360 align:start position:0%
provides them a Litany of rights that
 
01:34:19.350 --> 01:34:19.360 align:start position:0%
must be read to them and the process for
 
01:34:22.350 --> 01:34:22.360 align:start position:0%
exercising those rights how this one
 
01:34:25.590 --> 01:34:25.600 align:start position:0%
additional right amounts to 12 new cpsws
 
01:34:27.910 --> 01:34:27.920 align:start position:0%
at a cost to the state of $1 million and
 
01:34:29.990 --> 01:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
I know we're not in fiscal um but I do
 
01:34:31.950 --> 01:34:31.960 align:start position:0%
think it's important to recognize that
 
01:34:33.510 --> 01:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
and to ask the questions of the
 
01:34:35.070 --> 01:34:35.080 align:start position:0%
department that if this is the fiscal
 
01:34:37.430 --> 01:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
note they're telling you exists to bring
 
01:34:39.870 --> 01:34:39.880 align:start position:0%
in the people to explain what this extra
 
01:34:42.430 --> 01:34:42.440 align:start position:0%
additional work really does entail thank
 
01:34:44.310 --> 01:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
you so much do we have any
 
01:34:47.470 --> 01:34:47.480 align:start position:0%
questions you packed a lot I
 
01:34:49.870 --> 01:34:49.880 align:start position:0%
apologize she did a good
 
01:34:53.229 --> 01:34:53.239 align:start position:0%
job so did you thank you thank you very
 
01:34:56.990 --> 01:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
much you chair now recognizes um as our
 
01:35:00.310 --> 01:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
final speaker on this um attorney Erin
 
01:35:06.270 --> 01:35:06.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:08.709 --> 01:35:08.719 align:start position:0%
branch good morning Mr chair members of
 
01:35:11.149 --> 01:35:11.159 align:start position:0%
the committee nice to see you all again
 
01:35:12.390 --> 01:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
um I I always feel as though I'm the
 
01:35:13.990 --> 01:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
least exciting speaker because the
 
01:35:16.030 --> 01:35:16.040 align:start position:0%
judicial branch doesn't have a policy
 
01:35:18.030 --> 01:35:18.040 align:start position:0%
objective we defer to you we take your
 
01:35:21.189 --> 01:35:21.199 align:start position:0%
cue on policy thank you when I review a
 
01:35:22.910 --> 01:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
bill that you've you've passed through
 
01:35:24.550 --> 01:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
each house and substantially a similar
 
01:35:26.070 --> 01:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
form the thing that we're looking at it
 
01:35:27.950 --> 01:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
for is do we have any questions on
 
01:35:29.390 --> 01:35:29.400 align:start position:0%
implementation is there going to be any
 
01:35:31.550 --> 01:35:31.560 align:start position:0%
challenge implementing the will of the
 
01:35:33.590 --> 01:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
legislature and I think for this one
 
01:35:35.229 --> 01:35:35.239 align:start position:0%
there was a small challenge that we
 
01:35:37.669 --> 01:35:37.679 align:start position:0%
identified which I believe can be solved
 
01:35:41.149 --> 01:35:41.159 align:start position:0%
um but we do have in general a shortage
 
01:35:43.109 --> 01:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
of attorneys of of all kinds in New
 
01:35:44.910 --> 01:35:44.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have police prosecutors we
 
01:35:46.470 --> 01:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
have par professionals that represent
 
01:35:48.790 --> 01:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
people um but we also have a shortage of
 
01:35:51.310 --> 01:35:51.320 align:start position:0%
attorneys in this specific area that are
 
01:35:53.270 --> 01:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable and there have been some
 
01:35:54.990 --> 01:35:55.000 align:start position:0%
families law judges that have sort of
 
01:35:57.350 --> 01:35:57.360 align:start position:0%
raised for me the question of what would
 
01:35:59.870 --> 01:35:59.880 align:start position:0%
we do if we had a mandatory appointment
 
01:36:01.470 --> 01:36:01.480 align:start position:0%
and we did not have an attorney
 
01:36:04.270 --> 01:36:04.280 align:start position:0%
available um we want to make sure that
 
01:36:06.149 --> 01:36:06.159 align:start position:0%
we're doing what you are envisioning
 
01:36:08.310 --> 01:36:08.320 align:start position:0%
that we would do in that scenario not
 
01:36:09.750 --> 01:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
having different judges do different
 
01:36:11.669 --> 01:36:11.679 align:start position:0%
things or being confused about what the
 
01:36:14.310 --> 01:36:14.320 align:start position:0%
the legislator's policy intention is um
 
01:36:16.470 --> 01:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
it it could certainly be an option to
 
01:36:18.350 --> 01:36:18.360 align:start position:0%
say that the the court should simply
 
01:36:20.430 --> 01:36:20.440 align:start position:0%
proceed if a person's not available but
 
01:36:21.669 --> 01:36:21.679 align:start position:0%
you may determine that there would be
 
01:36:24.470 --> 01:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
another uh answer to that question
 
01:36:26.430 --> 01:36:26.440 align:start position:0%
uh it is certainly something that I hope
 
01:36:28.430 --> 01:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
does not happen in which case if the
 
01:36:30.390 --> 01:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
language is added it will never be used
 
01:36:33.430 --> 01:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
and it would be not be harmful to add uh
 
01:36:34.750 --> 01:36:34.760 align:start position:0%
but it is something that we would
 
01:36:38.470 --> 01:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate the legislature's guidance um
 
01:36:40.510 --> 01:36:40.520 align:start position:0%
there is another uh organization the
 
01:36:43.709 --> 01:36:43.719 align:start position:0%
judicial Council which uh pays for uh
 
01:36:46.590 --> 01:36:46.600 align:start position:0%
attorneys in cases of criminal indigency
 
01:36:49.189 --> 01:36:49.199 align:start position:0%
for for parents who have uh proceedings
 
01:36:51.189 --> 01:36:51.199 align:start position:0%
brought against them they've put a
 
01:36:54.430 --> 01:36:54.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal note I think on both 535 and on
 
01:36:57.070 --> 01:36:57.080 align:start position:0%
this bill uh that's a little bit uh
 
01:36:58.510 --> 01:36:58.520 align:start position:0%
different maybe from different phases
 
01:37:00.790 --> 01:37:00.800 align:start position:0%
different versions of the bill but they
 
01:37:02.870 --> 01:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
will have some costs I don't think
 
01:37:04.550 --> 01:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
they've completely estimated what they
 
01:37:06.510 --> 01:37:06.520 align:start position:0%
are but it's certainly in the hundreds
 
01:37:08.990 --> 01:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
of thousands I should think um
 
01:37:10.510 --> 01:37:10.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunately Jay Bucky's not here he
 
01:37:13.030 --> 01:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
was here at some of your hearings on 535
 
01:37:15.510 --> 01:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
but uh that that is a cost that you
 
01:37:17.109 --> 01:37:17.119 align:start position:0%
additionally would have to be paid for
 
01:37:19.310 --> 01:37:19.320 align:start position:0%
attorneys to represent the children as
 
01:37:20.430 --> 01:37:20.440 align:start position:0%
opposed to the attorneys who are
 
01:37:22.470 --> 01:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
representing the HHS who are provided
 
01:37:25.070 --> 01:37:25.080 align:start position:0%
for in the current language thank you
 
01:37:27.550 --> 01:37:27.560 align:start position:0%
very much and for the committee uh to
 
01:37:31.030 --> 01:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
know we will exec this bill at 2:30ish
 
01:37:32.790 --> 01:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
this afternoon that is what has been
 
01:37:36.470 --> 01:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
noticed in the calendar uh I have gotten
 
01:37:43.350 --> 01:37:43.360 align:start position:0%
OS to prepare an amendment that um moves
 
01:37:46.990 --> 01:37:47.000 align:start position:0%
shall to we really hope we can uh by
 
01:37:49.189 --> 01:37:49.199 align:start position:0%
taking out appropriate Clauses of the
 
01:37:52.390 --> 01:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
bill um after an initial discussion
 
01:37:54.149 --> 01:37:54.159 align:start position:0%
amongst the committee
 
01:37:56.669 --> 01:37:56.679 align:start position:0%
uh I may put the amendment into play or
 
01:37:59.950 --> 01:37:59.960 align:start position:0%
not but I have it in case we need it we
 
01:38:01.950 --> 01:38:01.960 align:start position:0%
may not need it we may not wish it but
 
01:38:04.750 --> 01:38:04.760 align:start position:0%
it will be there just in case to speak
 
01:38:10.109 --> 01:38:10.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:13.830 --> 01:38:13.840 align:start position:0%
you I guess so representative bigford
 
01:38:16.229 --> 01:38:16.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair you're welcome um
 
01:38:19.149 --> 01:38:19.159 align:start position:0%
thank you of course um you spoke of the
 
01:38:22.390 --> 01:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
judicial Council um I'm thinking back
 
01:38:24.990 --> 01:38:25.000 align:start position:0%
and it was my understanding
 
01:38:27.350 --> 01:38:27.360 align:start position:0%
long time ago that judicial Council
 
01:38:30.430 --> 01:38:30.440 align:start position:0%
would would pay funds for uh a parent
 
01:38:31.870 --> 01:38:31.880 align:start position:0%
that didn't have the money at the time
 
01:38:33.589 --> 01:38:33.599 align:start position:0%
but there was an expectation for them to
 
01:38:38.669 --> 01:38:38.679 align:start position:0%
pay it back and I'm not sure what the
 
01:38:41.390 --> 01:38:41.400 align:start position:0%
contractual side of that is and do you
 
01:38:43.629 --> 01:38:43.639 align:start position:0%
know anything about that I know a little
 
01:38:45.109 --> 01:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
bit about it I I think there are many
 
01:38:47.229 --> 01:38:47.239 align:start position:0%
people who are not in a position to pay
 
01:38:49.510 --> 01:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
it back at any time in the the near
 
01:38:51.510 --> 01:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
future but um they receive the
 
01:38:53.629 --> 01:38:53.639 align:start position:0%
representation not withstanding from and
 
01:38:56.750 --> 01:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
the judicial Council does front those
 
01:39:01.310 --> 01:39:01.320 align:start position:0%
costs so follow up thank you Mr
 
01:39:04.390 --> 01:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
chair so at least there's there's an
 
01:39:06.070 --> 01:39:06.080 align:start position:0%
expectation that the parents would pay
 
01:39:07.470 --> 01:39:07.480 align:start position:0%
for it isn't there they wouldn't be
 
01:39:10.470 --> 01:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
absolved of not paying for their
 
01:39:12.669 --> 01:39:12.679 align:start position:0%
children even if
 
01:39:16.070 --> 01:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
they their rights are being uh uh
 
01:39:18.910 --> 01:39:18.920 align:start position:0%
removed perhaps does that sound
 
01:39:20.950 --> 01:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
correct if I'm understanding your
 
01:39:22.750 --> 01:39:22.760 align:start position:0%
question correctly and and I may not be
 
01:39:25.270 --> 01:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
uh I I think you may be asking whether
 
01:39:27.189 --> 01:39:27.199 align:start position:0%
the parents would pay for this attorney
 
01:39:29.109 --> 01:39:29.119 align:start position:0%
for the child in the case of a mandatory
 
01:39:31.709 --> 01:39:31.719 align:start position:0%
appointment and I don't see that that is
 
01:39:33.950 --> 01:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
um specifically clued to in this
 
01:39:36.270 --> 01:39:36.280 align:start position:0%
legislation or in any existing
 
01:39:41.430 --> 01:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
law we again again Mr chairman I think
 
01:39:43.510 --> 01:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
we should we should know
 
01:39:46.430 --> 01:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
that we should know where the
 
01:39:49.189 --> 01:39:49.199 align:start position:0%
responsibility is going to be dropped
 
01:39:50.589 --> 01:39:50.599 align:start position:0%
whether it's the state or whether it's
 
01:39:53.390 --> 01:39:53.400 align:start position:0%
the parents or sometimes the parents
 
01:39:55.669 --> 01:39:55.679 align:start position:0%
thank you i' appreciate hearing
 
01:39:59.149 --> 01:39:59.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:02.109 --> 01:40:02.119 align:start position:0%
further yes Vice chairman long thank you
 
01:40:03.990 --> 01:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh
 
01:40:06.350 --> 01:40:06.360 align:start position:0%
so I think collaboration with the
 
01:40:09.470 --> 01:40:09.480 align:start position:0%
children Law Center um saying that they
 
01:40:11.350 --> 01:40:11.360 align:start position:0%
will take on a responsibility of
 
01:40:16.629 --> 01:40:16.639 align:start position:0%
training um attorneys uh would uh would
 
01:40:20.669 --> 01:40:20.679 align:start position:0%
probably be good for the judicial to uh
 
01:40:23.589 --> 01:40:23.599 align:start position:0%
assert that with them uh and also Al if
 
01:40:27.790 --> 01:40:27.800 align:start position:0%
I may with respect to the parents paying
 
01:40:30.629 --> 01:40:30.639 align:start position:0%
I believe we passed a
 
01:40:35.229 --> 01:40:35.239 align:start position:0%
um there's a statute where for services
 
01:40:37.669 --> 01:40:37.679 align:start position:0%
we don't charge the parent uh and this
 
01:40:39.790 --> 01:40:39.800 align:start position:0%
would be a service so we wouldn't be
 
01:40:42.709 --> 01:40:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:45.750 --> 01:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
parents thank you I I we will certainly
 
01:40:46.990 --> 01:40:47.000 align:start position:0%
uh collaborate I think the judicial
 
01:40:49.430 --> 01:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
Council has already started working but
 
01:40:52.470 --> 01:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
um to if this will be a pro bono
 
01:40:54.390 --> 01:40:54.400 align:start position:0%
assignment mandatory appointments of
 
01:40:56.870 --> 01:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
attorneys let's say a proon attorney
 
01:40:58.830 --> 01:40:58.840 align:start position:0%
takes three cases a year you would need
 
01:41:01.350 --> 01:41:01.360 align:start position:0%
to have over 40 new attorneys
 
01:41:03.430 --> 01:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
significantly committing to prono that
 
01:41:04.950 --> 01:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
aren't currently being utilized
 
01:41:07.470 --> 01:41:07.480 align:start position:0%
somewhere else that would represent a
 
01:41:10.030 --> 01:41:10.040 align:start position:0%
very big find that we would all have to
 
01:41:11.470 --> 01:41:11.480 align:start position:0%
run down and that would be a challenge
 
01:41:11.480 --> 01:41:15.149 align:start position:0%
run down and that would be a challenge
to

01:41:15.149 --> 01:41:15.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:18.390 --> 01:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
do this concludes the hearing on uh
 
01:41:20.750 --> 01:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 463 thank you very much
 
01:41:23.390 --> 01:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
counselor and we will be executing that
 
01:41:25.950 --> 01:41:25.960 align:start position:0%

good morning again Mr chairman and good
 
01:46:30.510 --> 01:46:30.520 align:start position:0%
morning to the committee again uh for
 
01:46:32.149 --> 01:46:32.159 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Sharon Carson and
 
01:46:34.589 --> 01:46:34.599 align:start position:0%
I have the pleasure of representing
 
01:46:37.030 --> 01:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
Senate District 14 comprising the towns
 
01:46:39.430 --> 01:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
of londonairy Hudson and Auburn and I
 
01:46:41.270 --> 01:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
have for your consideration this morning
 
01:46:44.830 --> 01:46:44.840 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 459 which seeks to establish
 
01:46:46.709 --> 01:46:46.719 align:start position:0%
a committee to study the child
 
01:46:50.629 --> 01:46:50.639 align:start position:0%
protection act Mr chairman this bill um
 
01:46:52.270 --> 01:46:52.280 align:start position:0%
didn't end up didn't start out being a
 
01:46:53.470 --> 01:46:53.480 align:start position:0%
study committee
 
01:46:55.270 --> 01:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
it was a a pretty much a complete
 
01:46:57.870 --> 01:46:57.880 align:start position:0%
rewrite of the child protection act as
 
01:47:00.709 --> 01:47:00.719 align:start position:0%
you can imagine that is fairly
 
01:47:03.830 --> 01:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
extensive um and we did get some push
 
01:47:06.030 --> 01:47:06.040 align:start position:0%
back concerning uh some of the
 
01:47:07.950 --> 01:47:07.960 align:start position:0%
definitions that we were trying to put
 
01:47:11.550 --> 01:47:11.560 align:start position:0%
into place and as you can see there were
 
01:47:14.270 --> 01:47:14.280 align:start position:0%
a number of child bills that came out of
 
01:47:16.510 --> 01:47:16.520 align:start position:0%
the Senate this year and we just didn't
 
01:47:19.589 --> 01:47:19.599 align:start position:0%
have the time to go through this the way
 
01:47:21.830 --> 01:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
that it really needed to go be gone
 
01:47:24.750 --> 01:47:24.760 align:start position:0%
through so I because it was my bill I
 
01:47:28.790 --> 01:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
made the decision to put it into a study
 
01:47:31.669 --> 01:47:31.679 align:start position:0%
committee and um and work with the
 
01:47:33.950 --> 01:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
public to flesh this out in an
 
01:47:37.149 --> 01:47:37.159 align:start position:0%
appropriate Manner and hopefully next
 
01:47:40.589 --> 01:47:40.599 align:start position:0%
year uh or the end of this year we will
 
01:47:44.430 --> 01:47:44.440 align:start position:0%
all be sitting here again and uh we can
 
01:47:47.629 --> 01:47:47.639 align:start position:0%
deal with this issue in a bill um and Mr
 
01:47:49.790 --> 01:47:49.800 align:start position:0%
chairman just note for the record that
 
01:47:52.229 --> 01:47:52.239 align:start position:0%
whenever I suggest a study committee I
 
01:47:55.229 --> 01:47:55.239 align:start position:0%
volunteer to work on it so I'm not
 
01:47:57.870 --> 01:47:57.880 align:start position:0%
pushing the work off to other people and
 
01:48:00.030 --> 01:48:00.040 align:start position:0%
Senate to the follow-up statement by the
 
01:48:02.229 --> 01:48:02.239 align:start position:0%

01:48:04.390 --> 01:48:04.400 align:start position:0%

Senate Bill 417 we're here I know um I
 
01:48:39.830 --> 01:48:39.840 align:start position:0%

01:48:41.750 --> 01:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
again for people who would like to be
 
01:48:44.189 --> 01:48:44.199 align:start position:0%
considered to serve on this uh that
 
01:48:45.990 --> 01:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't guarantee you'll have a place
 
01:48:48.070 --> 01:48:48.080 align:start position:0%
but I'd like to know who's interested in
 
01:48:49.589 --> 01:48:49.599 align:start position:0%
it sounds like there's going to be quite
 
01:48:51.510 --> 01:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
a bit of work done on that committee I
 
01:48:54.149 --> 01:48:54.159 align:start position:0%
think so Mr chairman thank you Senator
 
01:48:56.030 --> 01:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
well I think you know because there's
 
01:48:58.430 --> 01:48:58.440 align:start position:0%
two senators that are going to have been
 
01:49:00.589 --> 01:49:00.599 align:start position:0%
on this and you know the Senators do not
 
01:49:03.109 --> 01:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
like to do this so I also know how to
 
01:49:07.470 --> 01:49:07.480 align:start position:0%
divide by 400 and by 24 so yes so good
 
01:49:08.750 --> 01:49:08.760 align:start position:0%

U moving to a committee to study I will
 
01:50:04.629 --> 01:50:04.639 align:start position:0%
share a little bit of a background very
 
01:50:08.070 --> 01:50:08.080 align:start position:0%
briefly of um what brought us to working
 
01:50:10.229 --> 01:50:10.239 align:start position:0%
on this um in conjunction with the
 
01:50:13.070 --> 01:50:13.080 align:start position:0%
sponsor Senator Carson um the office of
 
01:50:15.870 --> 01:50:15.880 align:start position:0%
the child advocate utilizes a safety
 
01:50:18.669 --> 01:50:18.679 align:start position:0%
science system mapping review process
 
01:50:20.310 --> 01:50:20.320 align:start position:0%
and our last system mapping review We
 
01:50:24.149 --> 01:50:24.159 align:start position:0%
conducted was in August of 2023 and this
 
01:50:26.790 --> 01:50:26.800 align:start position:0%
mapping was taking a look at um we
 
01:50:28.229 --> 01:50:28.239 align:start position:0%
received in a short period of time
 
01:50:32.070 --> 01:50:32.080 align:start position:0%
between February and June 2023 um nine
 
01:50:34.310 --> 01:50:34.320 align:start position:0%
calls to our office about non-ambulatory
 
01:50:36.950 --> 01:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
infants with serious injuries um
 
01:50:39.550 --> 01:50:39.560 align:start position:0%
physical injuries broken bones um many
 
01:50:41.589 --> 01:50:41.599 align:start position:0%
of them many of those um included
 
01:50:43.229 --> 01:50:43.239 align:start position:0%
children with multiple broken bones at
 
01:50:45.149 --> 01:50:45.159 align:start position:0%
different levels of healing uh we
 
01:50:46.750 --> 01:50:46.760 align:start position:0%
conducted a mapping on three of those we
 
01:50:48.470 --> 01:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
pulled out three of the specific cases
 
01:50:51.830 --> 01:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
and in our mapping we identified that um
 
01:50:53.589 --> 01:50:53.599 align:start position:0%
so for a learning Point first we
 
01:50:55.950 --> 01:50:55.960 align:start position:0%
identified that these children did
 
01:50:55.960 --> 01:50:57.189 align:start position:0%
identified that these children did
present

01:50:57.189 --> 01:50:57.199 align:start position:0%
present
 
01:51:00.669 --> 01:51:00.679 align:start position:0%
to um expert doctors and those expert
 
01:51:02.510 --> 01:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
doctors were able to do imaging that
 
01:51:05.550 --> 01:51:05.560 align:start position:0%
showed that these B broken bones were at
 
01:51:08.069 --> 01:51:08.079 align:start position:0%
different levels of healing and that um
 
01:51:09.830 --> 01:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
all of those three cases those children
 
01:51:12.069 --> 01:51:12.079 align:start position:0%
were returned home to their families
 
01:51:14.990 --> 01:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
with no identified um reason for the
 
01:51:17.470 --> 01:51:17.480 align:start position:0%
injuries and um no identified
 
01:51:19.669 --> 01:51:19.679 align:start position:0%
perpetrator but with the primary
 
01:51:22.750 --> 01:51:22.760 align:start position:0%
caregivers being the biological parents
 
01:51:25.589 --> 01:51:25.599 align:start position:0%
and no external caregivers having been
 
01:51:27.629 --> 01:51:27.639 align:start position:0%
providing care within that time frame so
 
01:51:30.550 --> 01:51:30.560 align:start position:0%
what that tells us is that these very
 
01:51:32.149 --> 01:51:32.159 align:start position:0%
very vulnerable young children who
 
01:51:34.229 --> 01:51:34.239 align:start position:0%
cannot speak up on their own behalf were
 
01:51:37.470 --> 01:51:37.480 align:start position:0%
sent home to potential perpetrators um
 
01:51:39.310 --> 01:51:39.320 align:start position:0%
and put in unsafe situation because
 
01:51:41.390 --> 01:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
there was no intervention able to be in
 
01:51:43.030 --> 01:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
place with those perpetrators because
 
01:51:45.430 --> 01:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
the courts had dismissed the petitions
 
01:51:46.709 --> 01:51:46.719 align:start position:0%
that the agency
 
01:51:50.109 --> 01:51:50.119 align:start position:0%
filed and so in reviewing that we during
 
01:51:52.149 --> 01:51:52.159 align:start position:0%
this um review We included Professionals
 
01:51:53.390 --> 01:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
for the medical Community Law
 
01:51:56.270 --> 01:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
Enforcement provider agencies to really
 
01:51:58.910 --> 01:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
take that holistic view of what went
 
01:52:00.270 --> 01:52:00.280 align:start position:0%
wrong for these children what
 
01:52:01.669 --> 01:52:01.679 align:start position:0%
systemically should we be looking at to
 
01:52:04.510 --> 01:52:04.520 align:start position:0%
build up to avoid these instances from
 
01:52:06.709 --> 01:52:06.719 align:start position:0%
happening in the future and there was a
 
01:52:08.830 --> 01:52:08.840 align:start position:0%
lot of discussion around the current
 
01:52:10.870 --> 01:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
state of the abuse and neglect laws in
 
01:52:14.310 --> 01:52:14.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um being quite outdated um
 
01:52:17.510 --> 01:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
not taking into account these um when
 
01:52:19.069 --> 01:52:19.079 align:start position:0%
we're talking about young children who
 
01:52:20.950 --> 01:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
can't disclose and there's no other
 
01:52:22.709 --> 01:52:22.719 align:start position:0%
explanation given but there's not
 
01:52:25.950 --> 01:52:25.960 align:start position:0%
perpetrator um there was also concern
 
01:52:30.310 --> 01:52:30.320 align:start position:0%
for excuse me um so we also had concern
 
01:52:33.750 --> 01:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
for um the safety planning process and
 
01:52:35.790 --> 01:52:35.800 align:start position:0%
um conversations between medical
 
01:52:38.589 --> 01:52:38.599 align:start position:0%
providers and um the agency and law
 
01:52:40.669 --> 01:52:40.679 align:start position:0%
enforcement and sharing of documentation
 
01:52:42.430 --> 01:52:42.440 align:start position:0%
so ultimately we came out of that review
 
01:52:44.629 --> 01:52:44.639 align:start position:0%
with recommendations one of them being
 
01:52:46.870 --> 01:52:46.880 align:start position:0%
particularly around looking at the abuse
 
01:52:48.830 --> 01:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
and neglect laws ensuring that they're
 
01:52:50.830 --> 01:52:50.840 align:start position:0%
up to date with trauma informed care
 
01:52:52.790 --> 01:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
ensuring that we're taking into account
 
01:52:55.229 --> 01:52:55.239 align:start position:0%
the emotional and psychological impact
 
01:52:56.950 --> 01:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
to children when abuse and neglect
 
01:52:59.669 --> 01:52:59.679 align:start position:0%
occurs um also acknowledging the fact
 
01:53:02.350 --> 01:53:02.360 align:start position:0%
that there are many children that have
 
01:53:04.870 --> 01:53:04.880 align:start position:0%
resiliency and they do not necessarily
 
01:53:07.229 --> 01:53:07.239 align:start position:0%
present in a way as though they are
 
01:53:09.589 --> 01:53:09.599 align:start position:0%
traumatized but they are the resiliency
 
01:53:11.629 --> 01:53:11.639 align:start position:0%
is the only thing getting them through
 
01:53:13.390 --> 01:53:13.400 align:start position:0%
and we need our laws to acknowledge that
 
01:53:15.229 --> 01:53:15.239 align:start position:0%
although a child may be attending school
 
01:53:17.430 --> 01:53:17.440 align:start position:0%
every single day and may have straight A
 
01:53:19.229 --> 01:53:19.239 align:start position:0%
and doing well does not mean that there
 
01:53:20.830 --> 01:53:20.840 align:start position:0%
is not underlying trauma that needs to
 
01:53:22.870 --> 01:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
be treated and there's not an impact
 
01:53:24.750 --> 01:53:24.760 align:start position:0%
from what had occurred to them in that
 
01:53:27.270 --> 01:53:27.280 align:start position:0%
that family home setting um and that can
 
01:53:29.510 --> 01:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
have a greater impact as they age if
 
01:53:31.470 --> 01:53:31.480 align:start position:0%
untreated and so that was a lot of the
 
01:53:33.229 --> 01:53:33.239 align:start position:0%
goal here was taking a look and ensuring
 
01:53:35.189 --> 01:53:35.199 align:start position:0%
that our laws are up to date in that
 
01:53:37.950 --> 01:53:37.960 align:start position:0%
search we also took a look at the abuse
 
01:53:39.950 --> 01:53:39.960 align:start position:0%
and neglect laws in many of the other
 
01:53:42.189 --> 01:53:42.199 align:start position:0%
states across the country pulling out
 
01:53:44.629 --> 01:53:44.639 align:start position:0%
some specific language um from states
 
01:53:47.950 --> 01:53:47.960 align:start position:0%
such as um New Jersey
 
01:53:50.870 --> 01:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
Colorado there's one more um but really
 
01:53:52.430 --> 01:53:52.440 align:start position:0%
comparing many many of the states and
 
01:53:54.950 --> 01:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
looking at those that had the um laws
 
01:53:57.030 --> 01:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
that were either changed within the
 
01:53:59.069 --> 01:53:59.079 align:start position:0%
recent years or more up to date with
 
01:54:00.669 --> 01:54:00.679 align:start position:0%
what current science is telling us for
 
01:54:02.550 --> 01:54:02.560 align:start position:0%
the impact of trauma on
 
01:54:04.589 --> 01:54:04.599 align:start position:0%
children and I just wanted to point out
 
01:54:07.189 --> 01:54:07.199 align:start position:0%
one section that has uh raised concerns
 
01:54:09.310 --> 01:54:09.320 align:start position:0%
as far as transitioning this bill into a
 
01:54:14.189 --> 01:54:14.199 align:start position:0%
study committee um RSA 169 C12 F the
 
01:54:16.750 --> 01:54:16.760 align:start position:0%
rebuttable presumption of harm is
 
01:54:19.310 --> 01:54:19.320 align:start position:0%
sunsetting July 1st
 
01:54:23.589 --> 01:54:23.599 align:start position:0%
2024 so one of the things that s B 459
 
01:54:25.750 --> 01:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
was doing was repealing that Sunset
 
01:54:27.750 --> 01:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
there was also some updates to that
 
01:54:29.709 --> 01:54:29.719 align:start position:0%
section but I did just want to point out
 
01:54:33.910 --> 01:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
to you all that SB 498 Senator Bradley's
 
01:54:35.950 --> 01:54:35.960 align:start position:0%
Bill relative to the Department of
 
01:54:39.350 --> 01:54:39.360 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services and DCF also
 
01:54:44.270 --> 01:54:44.280 align:start position:0%
includes a repeal of the repeal so 169
 
01:54:48.229 --> 01:54:48.239 align:start position:0%
C12 F if Senator Bradley's bill passes
 
01:54:51.669 --> 01:54:51.679 align:start position:0%
with that section intact will remain in
 
01:54:53.470 --> 01:54:53.480 align:start position:0%
effect as it currently is we would
 
01:54:55.310 --> 01:54:55.320 align:start position:0%
obviously like to see some updates to it
 
01:54:57.709 --> 01:54:57.719 align:start position:0%
the the um opiate section is a little
 
01:55:00.430 --> 01:55:00.440 align:start position:0%
outdated as well as there we had added a
 
01:55:02.709 --> 01:55:02.719 align:start position:0%
section about um this physical injury to
 
01:55:05.069 --> 01:55:05.079 align:start position:0%
non-ambulatory children to your to your
 
01:55:07.189 --> 01:55:07.199 align:start position:0%
knowledge cul what uh committee has that
 
01:55:10.350 --> 01:55:10.360 align:start position:0%
bill that bill has already been sent to
 
01:55:12.229 --> 01:55:12.239 align:start position:0%
the floor it was actually pulled off the
 
01:55:16.030 --> 01:55:16.040 align:start position:0%
consent calendar last week so we just
 
01:55:18.310 --> 01:55:18.320 align:start position:0%
wanted to bring that to your attention
 
01:55:20.069 --> 01:55:20.079 align:start position:0%
because we know you have your eye on
 
01:55:22.069 --> 01:55:22.079 align:start position:0%
these issues so if you could keep an eye
 
01:55:22.079 --> 01:55:22.910 align:start position:0%
these issues so if you could keep an eye
on

01:55:22.910 --> 01:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:55:25.870 --> 01:55:25.880 align:start position:0%
sp98 that repeal of the repeal which I
 
01:55:28.589 --> 01:55:28.599 align:start position:0%
believe is section8 it's I think it's
 
01:55:30.030 --> 01:55:30.040 align:start position:0%
the very last section of Senator
 
01:55:32.910 --> 01:55:32.920 align:start position:0%
Bradley's bill that really needs to pass
 
01:55:36.750 --> 01:55:36.760 align:start position:0%
somewhere either in 498 or if not put it
 
01:55:39.830 --> 01:55:39.840 align:start position:0%
back into this bill somehow um because
 
01:55:41.750 --> 01:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
that rebuttable presumption of harm is a
 
01:55:45.430 --> 01:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
really important section um there's a
 
01:55:46.790 --> 01:55:46.800 align:start position:0%
some really important language around
 
01:55:48.589 --> 01:55:48.599 align:start position:0%
domestic violence as well that was
 
01:55:52.390 --> 01:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
worked on years ago so um just keep it
 
01:55:54.149 --> 01:55:54.159 align:start position:0%
eye out on that if you could because we
 
01:55:57.910 --> 01:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
don't want that to Sunset completely um
 
01:55:59.390 --> 01:55:59.400 align:start position:0%
so we just wanted to bring that to your
 
01:56:01.229 --> 01:56:01.239 align:start position:0%
attention but you know having this study
 
01:56:02.589 --> 01:56:02.599 align:start position:0%
committee we did just want to give you a
 
01:56:04.990 --> 01:56:05.000 align:start position:0%
little bit of context we obviously will
 
01:56:06.990 --> 01:56:07.000 align:start position:0%
come visit the study committee and uh
 
01:56:08.550 --> 01:56:08.560 align:start position:0%
bring all of the information that we had
 
01:56:09.790 --> 01:56:09.800 align:start position:0%
put originally into the bill and the
 
01:56:12.629 --> 01:56:12.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:14.629 --> 01:56:14.639 align:start position:0%
it any
 
01:56:18.109 --> 01:56:18.119 align:start position:0%
questions representative McMahon thank
 
01:56:20.350 --> 01:56:20.360 align:start position:0%
you Mr
 
01:56:22.910 --> 01:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
chairman Attorney Mario relative to the
 
01:56:26.270 --> 01:56:26.280 align:start position:0%
hand out and also your professional
 
01:56:29.390 --> 01:56:29.400 align:start position:0%
associate um that you just uh handed out
 
01:56:32.189 --> 01:56:32.199 align:start position:0%
specific to the system review mapping
 
01:56:35.189 --> 01:56:35.199 align:start position:0%
where nine were identified as
 
01:56:38.510 --> 01:56:38.520 align:start position:0%
having injuries and that were not
 
01:56:41.189 --> 01:56:41.199 align:start position:0%
confirmed how they took place but it
 
01:56:43.470 --> 01:56:43.480 align:start position:0%
indicates here that they were returned
 
01:56:46.910 --> 01:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
to their homes was there any continuing
 
01:56:50.229 --> 01:56:50.239 align:start position:0%
uh this was 2023 as it States was there
 
01:56:51.709 --> 01:56:51.719 align:start position:0%
any continuing mapping as to what
 
01:56:54.510 --> 01:56:54.520 align:start position:0%
ultimately took took place with the
 
01:56:56.390 --> 01:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
returned children and something that
 
01:56:58.310 --> 01:56:58.320 align:start position:0%
this a study committee that would be
 
01:57:00.030 --> 01:57:00.040 align:start position:0%
addressing on
 
01:57:02.830 --> 01:57:02.840 align:start position:0%
further recordkeeping on whether they
 
01:57:04.870 --> 01:57:04.880 align:start position:0%
were as implied here potentially put
 
01:57:05.830 --> 01:57:05.840 align:start position:0%
back in
 
01:57:08.229 --> 01:57:08.239 align:start position:0%
danger so unfortunately for some of
 
01:57:10.830 --> 01:57:10.840 align:start position:0%
those we will have no information unless
 
01:57:14.229 --> 01:57:14.239 align:start position:0%
a new um abuse and neglect report is
 
01:57:17.069 --> 01:57:17.079 align:start position:0%
filed because ultimately at that point
 
01:57:19.390 --> 01:57:19.400 align:start position:0%
when the court dismisses um DCF no
 
01:57:20.830 --> 01:57:20.840 align:start position:0%
longer has a jurisdiction to work with
 
01:57:22.990 --> 01:57:23.000 align:start position:0%
the family and so they close out
 
01:57:26.189 --> 01:57:26.199 align:start position:0%
um there are a number of them in which
 
01:57:28.990 --> 01:57:29.000 align:start position:0%
um DCF appealed the judge's decision um
 
01:57:30.950 --> 01:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
or was provided more information and and
 
01:57:32.430 --> 01:57:32.440 align:start position:0%
brought that back to the courts and so
 
01:57:34.109 --> 01:57:34.119 align:start position:0%
some of these cases we do continue to
 
01:57:36.390 --> 01:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
follow any of them that are open with
 
01:57:38.149 --> 01:57:38.159 align:start position:0%
dcyf the office of the child advocate is
 
01:57:39.390 --> 01:57:39.400 align:start position:0%
tracking them closely and looking for
 
01:57:41.149 --> 01:57:41.159 align:start position:0%
outcomes for those children there were
 
01:57:42.870 --> 01:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
some of them that they were successful
 
01:57:44.390 --> 01:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
in those appeals or when providing more
 
01:57:46.030 --> 01:57:46.040 align:start position:0%
information to the court and those
 
01:57:49.189 --> 01:57:49.199 align:start position:0%
children um were either safety planned
 
01:57:51.229 --> 01:57:51.239 align:start position:0%
or um placed elsewhere and there were
 
01:57:52.910 --> 01:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
out of the nine
 
01:57:55.390 --> 01:57:55.400 align:start position:0%
um there were I believe two of those
 
01:57:58.390 --> 01:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
nine where um charges were fi ultimately
 
01:58:00.510 --> 01:58:00.520 align:start position:0%
filed against one parent as law
 
01:58:01.629 --> 01:58:01.639 align:start position:0%
enforcement got further into their
 
01:58:03.910 --> 01:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
instest investigation they were able to
 
01:58:05.790 --> 01:58:05.800 align:start position:0%
gather more information and um so the
 
01:58:07.830 --> 01:58:07.840 align:start position:0%
child stayed with the parent that law
 
01:58:09.990 --> 01:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement deemed safe and the other
 
01:58:12.550 --> 01:58:12.560 align:start position:0%
parent um was incarcerated at that time
 
01:58:15.950 --> 01:58:15.960 align:start position:0%
so we picked the three to study in the
 
01:58:18.870 --> 01:58:18.880 align:start position:0%
system review mapping that were that had
 
01:58:20.750 --> 01:58:20.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of similarities to them in the
 
01:58:23.149 --> 01:58:23.159 align:start position:0%
outcomes um as opposed to looking at the
 
01:58:24.910 --> 01:58:24.920 align:start position:0%
full nine because it would have been too
 
01:58:28.709 --> 01:58:28.719 align:start position:0%
complicated to try to address one giant
 
01:58:30.589 --> 01:58:30.599 align:start position:0%
issue with many different factors
 
01:58:32.870 --> 01:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
playing into it um but we do follow
 
01:58:34.229 --> 01:58:34.239 align:start position:0%
those outcomes for anywhere there is
 
01:58:37.790 --> 01:58:37.800 align:start position:0%
tracking in the system in the case you
 
01:58:42.030 --> 01:58:42.040 align:start position:0%
cited where the child upon
 
01:58:46.149 --> 01:58:46.159 align:start position:0%
x-rays uh had injuries that occurred on
 
01:58:46.159 --> 01:58:47.069 align:start position:0%
x-rays uh had injuries that occurred on
different

01:58:47.069 --> 01:58:47.079 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:58:49.229 --> 01:58:49.239 align:start position:0%
occasions uh would that lead your
 
01:58:52.149 --> 01:58:52.159 align:start position:0%
assumption to be that it was in the home
 
01:58:53.950 --> 01:58:53.960 align:start position:0%
that those injuries occurred with
 
01:58:56.990 --> 01:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
dangerous parent or parents yes yes
 
01:58:58.950 --> 01:58:58.960 align:start position:0%
based off of the findings and in the
 
01:59:00.830 --> 01:59:00.840 align:start position:0%
review of the medical records that we
 
01:59:03.870 --> 01:59:03.880 align:start position:0%
were able to see um it does appear that
 
01:59:06.430 --> 01:59:06.440 align:start position:0%
the medical team said that those there
 
01:59:08.149 --> 01:59:08.159 align:start position:0%
were indications that it was caused by
 
01:59:10.470 --> 01:59:10.480 align:start position:0%
child abuse and that there was no
 
01:59:12.870 --> 01:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
reasonable explanation provided um the
 
01:59:14.669 --> 01:59:14.679 align:start position:0%
medical team separate from law
 
01:59:16.910 --> 01:59:16.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement does sit down and and talk
 
01:59:19.270 --> 01:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
with a family when a child is going for
 
01:59:21.270 --> 01:59:21.280 align:start position:0%
the additional skeletal survey asking
 
01:59:22.910 --> 01:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
questions asking what could have
 
01:59:24.310 --> 01:59:24.320 align:start position:0%
happened in that home is there anything
 
01:59:26.830 --> 01:59:26.840 align:start position:0%
they could think of and um they were
 
01:59:29.030 --> 01:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
unable to there was only one out of
 
01:59:31.310 --> 01:59:31.320 align:start position:0%
those nine cases where a reasonable
 
01:59:33.870 --> 01:59:33.880 align:start position:0%
explanation was provided and in that one
 
01:59:36.589 --> 01:59:36.599 align:start position:0%
particular case um the child had been
 
01:59:40.229 --> 01:59:40.239 align:start position:0%
rolling off of a um changing table and a
 
01:59:42.069 --> 01:59:42.079 align:start position:0%
parent grabbed whatever they could grab
 
01:59:43.430 --> 01:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
to catch the child from Falling on the
 
01:59:45.750 --> 01:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
floor and when explained to the medical
 
01:59:47.229 --> 01:59:47.239 align:start position:0%
professionals and they did their
 
01:59:49.790 --> 01:59:49.800 align:start position:0%
extensive workup on that child they did
 
01:59:52.870 --> 01:59:52.880 align:start position:0%
find that injuries were appeared that
 
01:59:54.470 --> 01:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
they could have occurred from that type
 
01:59:57.910 --> 01:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
of injury of a of a grab of a limb being
 
02:00:00.550 --> 02:00:00.560 align:start position:0%
a part-time Chief Executive Officer of a
 
02:00:03.550 --> 02:00:03.560 align:start position:0%
Family Practice Medical Center and aware
 
02:00:06.109 --> 02:00:06.119 align:start position:0%
of how these various issues not only
 
02:00:07.910 --> 02:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
play out in conquered but around the
 
02:00:11.310 --> 02:00:11.320 align:start position:0%
country I am familiar with a case where
 
02:00:11.320 --> 02:00:12.589 align:start position:0%
country I am familiar with a case where
um

02:00:12.589 --> 02:00:12.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:12.599 --> 02:00:14.189 align:start position:0%
um
the

02:00:14.189 --> 02:00:14.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:00:17.229 --> 02:00:17.239 align:start position:0%
equivalent Department are rushed to
 
02:00:20.069 --> 02:00:20.079 align:start position:0%
judgment and it was later determined by
 
02:00:22.350 --> 02:00:22.360 align:start position:0%
finally interviewing Neighbors that the
 
02:00:25.030 --> 02:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
child in question was always jumping
 
02:00:26.589 --> 02:00:26.599 align:start position:0%
where the child shouldn't have been
 
02:00:29.430 --> 02:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
falling and these injuries were over
 
02:00:31.990 --> 02:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
different time Frameworks and it was not
 
02:00:34.350 --> 02:00:34.360 align:start position:0%
the parents that inflicted it and one
 
02:00:36.910 --> 02:00:36.920 align:start position:0%
would hope that the
 
02:00:39.270 --> 02:00:39.280 align:start position:0%
preliminary uh uh assessment of
 
02:00:41.149 --> 02:00:41.159 align:start position:0%
possibilities would not rise to the
 
02:00:44.589 --> 02:00:44.599 align:start position:0%
level of rush to judgment absolutely um
 
02:00:47.109 --> 02:00:47.119 align:start position:0%
and there in my understanding of the way
 
02:00:49.390 --> 02:00:49.400 align:start position:0%
in which the division manages these
 
02:00:51.430 --> 02:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
cases when they do come in they
 
02:00:53.629 --> 02:00:53.639 align:start position:0%
initially if they have concerns and
 
02:00:55.270 --> 02:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
additional skeletals needed that can
 
02:00:56.910 --> 02:00:56.920 align:start position:0%
take up to two weeks to be done and the
 
02:00:58.910 --> 02:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
Imaging to come back they will ask the
 
02:01:01.149 --> 02:01:01.159 align:start position:0%
family to come up with a safety plan for
 
02:01:02.669 --> 02:01:02.679 align:start position:0%
the child so rather than removing the
 
02:01:05.990 --> 02:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
child from the home they may ask a aunt
 
02:01:08.030 --> 02:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
Uncle grandmother to move into the home
 
02:01:09.910 --> 02:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
and be the supervisor to ensure nothing
 
02:01:12.709 --> 02:01:12.719 align:start position:0%
else occurs um or they may ask depending
 
02:01:14.629 --> 02:01:14.639 align:start position:0%
on the family situation could the child
 
02:01:17.109 --> 02:01:17.119 align:start position:0%
go and stay with a family member and the
 
02:01:19.589 --> 02:01:19.599 align:start position:0%
parents have time spent with the child
 
02:01:21.669 --> 02:01:21.679 align:start position:0%
under that family member supervision and
 
02:01:25.430 --> 02:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
so in none of these cases did we see DCF
 
02:01:29.149 --> 02:01:29.159 align:start position:0%
jump to quickly to removing a child they
 
02:01:31.510 --> 02:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
Tru all of these cases included a safety
 
02:01:33.550 --> 02:01:33.560 align:start position:0%
plan first and then the next step once
 
02:01:35.350 --> 02:01:35.360 align:start position:0%
they had additional information from
 
02:01:37.350 --> 02:01:37.360 align:start position:0%
medical providers and law enforcement
 
02:01:39.189 --> 02:01:39.199 align:start position:0%
then looked to filing petitions in the
 
02:01:41.669 --> 02:01:41.679 align:start position:0%
court believe me as supervising my staff
 
02:01:43.950 --> 02:01:43.960 align:start position:0%
I know it's not easy to
 
02:01:48.189 --> 02:01:48.199 align:start position:0%
do any questions yes uh representative
 
02:01:50.470 --> 02:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
Nelson thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
02:01:53.790 --> 02:01:53.800 align:start position:0%
for taking another question of mine um
 
02:01:57.550 --> 02:01:57.560 align:start position:0%
just looking at um lines 14 and 15 uh
 
02:02:00.430 --> 02:02:00.440 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral 3 study the expansion of
 
02:02:02.589 --> 02:02:02.599 align:start position:0%
the child abuse reporting requirement to
 
02:02:04.310 --> 02:02:04.320 align:start position:0%
include health care providers who treat
 
02:02:06.350 --> 02:02:06.360 align:start position:0%
a child under 13 years of age for a
 
02:02:08.750 --> 02:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
sexually transmitted disease could you
 
02:02:11.430 --> 02:02:11.440 align:start position:0%
please expand on that a little bit and
 
02:02:15.149 --> 02:02:15.159 align:start position:0%
um help us understand um where the 13
 
02:02:20.030 --> 02:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
years of age um was um why it's 13 years
 
02:02:23.270 --> 02:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
of age thank you uh this was is just one
 
02:02:25.069 --> 02:02:25.079 align:start position:0%
little section of the bill is actually
 
02:02:28.750 --> 02:02:28.760 align:start position:0%
the final section it aligns with um
 
02:02:30.830 --> 02:02:30.840 align:start position:0%
Nationwide practice that they've
 
02:02:34.510 --> 02:02:34.520 align:start position:0%
expanded reporting for medical providers
 
02:02:36.550 --> 02:02:36.560 align:start position:0%
that any child and that was just sort of
 
02:02:39.589 --> 02:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
the standard age I mean it could be 12
 
02:02:42.669 --> 02:02:42.679 align:start position:0%
it could be 11 um but really an age
 
02:02:45.350 --> 02:02:45.360 align:start position:0%
where a child would not
 
02:02:50.030 --> 02:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
be sexually active in any way and that
 
02:02:53.629 --> 02:02:53.639 align:start position:0%
providers would automatic Ally report it
 
02:02:56.149 --> 02:02:56.159 align:start position:0%
actually has to do with sex trafficking
 
02:02:58.830 --> 02:02:58.840 align:start position:0%
as well as child sexual abuse so there
 
02:03:01.750 --> 02:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
would be a a sort of presumption that we
 
02:03:03.790 --> 02:03:03.800 align:start position:0%
need to look into that if it's a child
 
02:03:07.310 --> 02:03:07.320 align:start position:0%
of that age with issues and it came out
 
02:03:09.310 --> 02:03:09.320 align:start position:0%
of conversations with medical providers
 
02:03:11.310 --> 02:03:11.320 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire sort of asking
 
02:03:13.310 --> 02:03:13.320 align:start position:0%
like we'd like to align better with
 
02:03:16.310 --> 02:03:16.320 align:start position:0%
Nationwide practice can I have
 
02:03:18.830 --> 02:03:18.840 align:start position:0%
a follow up yes thank you thank you Mr
 
02:03:20.669 --> 02:03:20.679 align:start position:0%
chairman uh thank you yes and I
 
02:03:22.270 --> 02:03:22.280 align:start position:0%
completely agree
 
02:03:25.550 --> 02:03:25.560 align:start position:0%
and uh and um
 
02:03:28.149 --> 02:03:28.159 align:start position:0%
encourage encourage is a the wrong word
 
02:03:29.910 --> 02:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
for that but I completely agree and
 
02:03:32.229 --> 02:03:32.239 align:start position:0%
understand why this would be included um
 
02:03:35.510 --> 02:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
would uh the age of 13 be the cutoff
 
02:03:37.350 --> 02:03:37.360 align:start position:0%
date because after the age of 13 there's
 
02:03:39.870 --> 02:03:39.880 align:start position:0%
certain privacy protections for the
 
02:03:42.549 --> 02:03:42.559 align:start position:0%
juvenile it would really be more where
 
02:03:45.229 --> 02:03:45.239 align:start position:0%
there' be a pres a strong presumption it
 
02:03:46.990 --> 02:03:47.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean a medical provider might
 
02:03:48.709 --> 02:03:48.719 align:start position:0%
not see a child of an older age and
 
02:03:52.030 --> 02:03:52.040 align:start position:0%
still make a report but it was sort of
 
02:03:54.629 --> 02:03:54.639 align:start position:0%
finding an age where like there's really
 
02:03:57.109 --> 02:03:57.119 align:start position:0%
no reasonable explanation why that child
 
02:03:58.470 --> 02:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
would have a sexually transmitted
 
02:04:00.549 --> 02:04:00.559 align:start position:0%
disease I think in conversations with
 
02:04:02.910 --> 02:04:02.920 align:start position:0%
those medical providers though they are
 
02:04:04.629 --> 02:04:04.639 align:start position:0%
a mandated reporter I mean they may
 
02:04:07.149 --> 02:04:07.159 align:start position:0%
still be reporting at at other ages but
 
02:04:10.149 --> 02:04:10.159 align:start position:0%
this was sort of creating a
 
02:04:13.109 --> 02:04:13.119 align:start position:0%
presumption representative
 
02:04:15.430 --> 02:04:15.440 align:start position:0%
ball thank you chairman
 
02:04:18.390 --> 02:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
parison um you mentioned the section on
 
02:04:21.310 --> 02:04:21.320 align:start position:0%
the rebuttable presumption and this came
 
02:04:23.109 --> 02:04:23.119 align:start position:0%
up before and I couldn't quite figure
 
02:04:25.709 --> 02:04:25.719 align:start position:0%
out how to ask the question um so I'll
 
02:04:28.750 --> 02:04:28.760 align:start position:0%
try it again I was understanding that
 
02:04:30.549 --> 02:04:30.559 align:start position:0%
that whole rebuttable presumption was
 
02:04:32.510 --> 02:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
kind of put in there as kind of a test
 
02:04:34.830 --> 02:04:34.840 align:start position:0%
drive or something which is why it had a
 
02:04:38.030 --> 02:04:38.040 align:start position:0%
sunset but now we're taking a sunset off
 
02:04:40.149 --> 02:04:40.159 align:start position:0%
and I'm just curious before we take a
 
02:04:42.910 --> 02:04:42.920 align:start position:0%
sunset off should we be collecting or
 
02:04:44.990 --> 02:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
should we have already collected data to
 
02:04:47.350 --> 02:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
make sure that there's no
 
02:04:49.750 --> 02:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
um unintended
 
02:04:52.390 --> 02:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
consequences from putting that to begin
 
02:04:54.470 --> 02:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
with and why are we going to keep doing
 
02:04:56.589 --> 02:04:56.599 align:start position:0%
it and in particular because we did such
 
02:04:59.350 --> 02:04:59.360 align:start position:0%
a big um kind of study into the family
 
02:05:02.549 --> 02:05:02.559 align:start position:0%
court system and that's where my head is
 
02:05:07.669 --> 02:05:07.679 align:start position:0%
stuck um I just keep wondering if the
 
02:05:09.669 --> 02:05:09.679 align:start position:0%
rebuttable presumption is in any way
 
02:05:11.549 --> 02:05:11.559 align:start position:0%
being used within the family court or
 
02:05:15.430 --> 02:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
being weaponized within the family court
 
02:05:17.709 --> 02:05:17.719 align:start position:0%
um and that's what I'm wondering if this
 
02:05:19.510 --> 02:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
study will cover that to make sure that
 
02:05:23.790 --> 02:05:23.800 align:start position:0%
we're that that it's not being used in a
 
02:05:26.109 --> 02:05:26.119 align:start position:0%
way to hurt families where that's not
 
02:05:26.119 --> 02:05:26.990 align:start position:0%
way to hurt families where that's not
the

02:05:26.990 --> 02:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:05:31.270 --> 02:05:31.280 align:start position:0%
intent so this section is in 169 C which
 
02:05:34.229 --> 02:05:34.239 align:start position:0%
is only the context of an a child abuse
 
02:05:36.189 --> 02:05:36.199 align:start position:0%
case this is not used in Family Court
 
02:05:38.390 --> 02:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
say in a parenting case or a
 
02:05:41.990 --> 02:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
guardianship so it's it's limited to
 
02:05:44.950 --> 02:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
169c um from all the conversations we've
 
02:05:48.589 --> 02:05:48.599 align:start position:0%
had with dcyf attorneys and workers
 
02:05:50.470 --> 02:05:50.480 align:start position:0%
advocacy groups like The
 
02:05:54.270 --> 02:05:54.280 align:start position:0%
Coalition and and other groups providers
 
02:05:56.830 --> 02:05:56.840 align:start position:0%
um the presumptions that are currently
 
02:05:59.149 --> 02:05:59.159 align:start position:0%
in place are very important and
 
02:06:01.229 --> 02:06:01.239 align:start position:0%
necessary within that child protection
 
02:06:03.229 --> 02:06:03.239 align:start position:0%
Arena and I'm sorry I don't have the
 
02:06:06.589 --> 02:06:06.599 align:start position:0%
language of the current presumption with
 
02:06:10.709 --> 02:06:10.719 align:start position:0%
me 459 had made some changes also based
 
02:06:12.549 --> 02:06:12.559 align:start position:0%
on conversations with
 
02:06:16.709 --> 02:06:16.719 align:start position:0%
dcyf attorneys workers medical providers
 
02:06:19.510 --> 02:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
Coalition other advocacy groups but as
 
02:06:21.990 --> 02:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
the presumption currently stands there
 
02:06:24.950 --> 02:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
is wide support and feeling that it's
 
02:06:27.189 --> 02:06:27.199 align:start position:0%
very important to keep in there in and
 
02:06:29.549 --> 02:06:29.559 align:start position:0%
again it's just in the context of abuse
 
02:06:31.870 --> 02:06:31.880 align:start position:0%
and neglect cases when there is a a
 
02:06:34.229 --> 02:06:34.239 align:start position:0%
concern for child abuse it's not used in
 
02:06:36.390 --> 02:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
parenting cases and particularly just to
 
02:06:38.629 --> 02:06:38.639 align:start position:0%
to add briefly to that um particularly
 
02:06:40.629 --> 02:06:40.639 align:start position:0%
in these cases that rebuttable
 
02:06:42.750 --> 02:06:42.760 align:start position:0%
presumption can allow families to stay
 
02:06:44.910 --> 02:06:44.920 align:start position:0%
together um because when we're talking
 
02:06:47.510 --> 02:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
about domestic violence cases
 
02:06:49.549 --> 02:06:49.559 align:start position:0%
specifically um a child witnessing
 
02:06:51.589 --> 02:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
domestic violence is impactful and is a
 
02:06:53.910 --> 02:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
traumatic event to them and so if there
 
02:06:56.910 --> 02:06:56.920 align:start position:0%
is a parent who is attempting to act
 
02:06:59.549 --> 02:06:59.559 align:start position:0%
protectively but is in fear to take
 
02:07:01.390 --> 02:07:01.400 align:start position:0%
certain steps to remove their family
 
02:07:04.310 --> 02:07:04.320 align:start position:0%
from an unsafe situation the court can
 
02:07:06.790 --> 02:07:06.800 align:start position:0%
weigh that that actually this parent
 
02:07:08.510 --> 02:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
although they may not have removed their
 
02:07:11.629 --> 02:07:11.639 align:start position:0%
child from the situation was acting and
 
02:07:14.069 --> 02:07:14.079 align:start position:0%
attempting to protect their child and so
 
02:07:15.870 --> 02:07:15.880 align:start position:0%
that mother does not need to be removed
 
02:07:17.350 --> 02:07:17.360 align:start position:0%
from her child and the two of them
 
02:07:19.990 --> 02:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
suffer further trauma rather that mother
 
02:07:22.069 --> 02:07:22.079 align:start position:0%
or the father either side could remain
 
02:07:24.629 --> 02:07:24.639 align:start position:0%
with that child and be supported to
 
02:07:26.830 --> 02:07:26.840 align:start position:0%
separate from the abuser in that
 
02:07:29.030 --> 02:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
situation so ideally that child should
 
02:07:31.470 --> 02:07:31.480 align:start position:0%
be able to remain and the court takes
 
02:07:33.229 --> 02:07:33.239 align:start position:0%
into consideration the importance of
 
02:07:34.750 --> 02:07:34.760 align:start position:0%
their ability to remain with a primary
 
02:07:38.870 --> 02:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
caregiver who is not AB abusive to them
 
02:07:40.990 --> 02:07:41.000 align:start position:0%
or the other primary caregiver and it's
 
02:07:43.790 --> 02:07:43.800 align:start position:0%
still a rebuttable presumption it just
 
02:07:46.510 --> 02:07:46.520 align:start position:0%
weighs the factors differently in very
 
02:07:49.470 --> 02:07:49.480 align:start position:0%
specific very limited cases it's pretty
 
02:07:49.480 --> 02:07:51.950 align:start position:0%
specific very limited cases it's pretty
narrow

02:07:51.950 --> 02:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
narrow
 
02:07:55.430 --> 02:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
follow up uh just to follow that up so I
 
02:07:57.950 --> 02:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
guess what I'm concerned about is in
 
02:08:00.109 --> 02:08:00.119 align:start position:0%
those cases
 
02:08:02.390 --> 02:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
where it's being brought before the
 
02:08:04.109 --> 02:08:04.119 align:start position:0%
family court when they're determining
 
02:08:06.750 --> 02:08:06.760 align:start position:0%
family you know parenting time that if
 
02:08:09.750 --> 02:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
there's an investigation going on um
 
02:08:11.510 --> 02:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
that has not yet been proven I just
 
02:08:14.510 --> 02:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
worry that that could then be um brought
 
02:08:16.629 --> 02:08:16.639 align:start position:0%
into the family court so I guess I'm
 
02:08:19.270 --> 02:08:19.280 align:start position:0%
still I'm still a little worried about
 
02:08:21.669 --> 02:08:21.679 align:start position:0%
um given what we've seen coming in to
 
02:08:24.910 --> 02:08:24.920 align:start position:0%
the family court and um parents being
 
02:08:26.910 --> 02:08:26.920 align:start position:0%
denied access to their children and then
 
02:08:29.069 --> 02:08:29.079 align:start position:0%
later finding out that they should not
 
02:08:31.750 --> 02:08:31.760 align:start position:0%
have been denied um that's that's where
 
02:08:33.830 --> 02:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
I just worry about it and I understand
 
02:08:35.510 --> 02:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
the intent of it and I think it's really
 
02:08:37.990 --> 02:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
good but at the same time I just I'm
 
02:08:39.189 --> 02:08:39.199 align:start position:0%
just wondering if we should be
 
02:08:43.069 --> 02:08:43.079 align:start position:0%
collecting data to make sure that it is
 
02:08:45.229 --> 02:08:45.239 align:start position:0%
not being used in a way it wasn't meant
 
02:08:47.750 --> 02:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
to be used and and again that's the
 
02:08:49.350 --> 02:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
study committee could certainly look at
 
02:08:51.750 --> 02:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
that I'm not sure if you could have you
 
02:08:54.589 --> 02:08:54.599 align:start position:0%
would collect data like that but again
 
02:08:57.990 --> 02:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
this section is directed to the court in
 
02:08:59.750 --> 02:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
an abuse and neglect case it doesn't
 
02:09:01.790 --> 02:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
really actually impact the investigation
 
02:09:04.870 --> 02:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
piece or what would be screened in or an
 
02:09:07.270 --> 02:09:07.280 align:start position:0%
assessment most of actually the
 
02:09:10.510 --> 02:09:10.520 align:start position:0%
definitions are the court applying it
 
02:09:12.830 --> 02:09:12.840 align:start position:0%
once the division has already filed a
 
02:09:20.109 --> 02:09:20.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:24.430 --> 02:09:24.440 align:start position:0%
piece I looked it up in 169 c2f is
 
02:09:27.350 --> 02:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
effective only as recently as July of
 
02:09:31.229 --> 02:09:31.239 align:start position:0%
2020 so there may not be a lot of
 
02:09:34.350 --> 02:09:34.360 align:start position:0%
history for us to look at just yet yes
 
02:09:36.830 --> 02:09:36.840 align:start position:0%
and 169
 
02:09:36.840 --> 02:09:39.109 align:start position:0%
and 169
c

02:09:39.109 --> 02:09:39.119 align:start position:0%
c
 
02:09:43.030 --> 02:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
e was 12E I'm sorry was actually the
 
02:09:45.030 --> 02:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
precursor which was only in place for a
 
02:09:46.790 --> 02:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
few years and I don't know why they
 
02:09:48.870 --> 02:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
didn't then just amend e but they got
 
02:09:52.350 --> 02:09:52.360 align:start position:0%
rid of e and started if F so um but
 
02:09:54.470 --> 02:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
again I don't know that the family
 
02:09:56.549 --> 02:09:56.559 align:start position:0%
parenting side cases would be collecting
 
02:09:58.510 --> 02:09:58.520 align:start position:0%
any data because these are very specific
 
02:10:03.030 --> 02:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
to 169c cases so okay thank you for
 
02:10:04.910 --> 02:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
looking that up welcome I couldn't carry
 
02:10:06.510 --> 02:10:06.520 align:start position:0%
my book today it was too heavy you
 
02:10:08.510 --> 02:10:08.520 align:start position:0%
people you know what you're trying to do
 
02:10:11.069 --> 02:10:11.079 align:start position:0%
and earlier when we wondered if there
 
02:10:13.069 --> 02:10:13.079 align:start position:0%
were enough lawyers I'm three years and
 
02:10:16.030 --> 02:10:16.040 align:start position:0%
one month short of getting a
 
02:10:19.669 --> 02:10:19.679 align:start position:0%
JD we a wait the day I know you do any
 
02:10:21.830 --> 02:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
questions any further questions
 
02:10:24.629 --> 02:10:24.639 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you so much
 
02:10:28.030 --> 02:10:28.040 align:start position:0%
thank you sir the chair recognizes uh
 
02:10:29.950 --> 02:10:29.960 align:start position:0%
Pamela is it

Hampshire Coalition against Domestic and
 
02:10:40.750 --> 02:10:40.760 align:start position:0%
Sexual Violence had a nice email
 
02:10:43.830 --> 02:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
exchange with Amanda Grady seon recently

thank you very much you're welcome um
 
02:10:50.430 --> 02:10:50.440 align:start position:0%
yeah U my name is Pamela kyg and I am
 
02:10:52.430 --> 02:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
the public polic specialist at the New
 
02:10:54.270 --> 02:10:54.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Coalition against Domestic and
 
02:10:56.510 --> 02:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
Sexual Violence thank you so much for
 
02:10:58.589 --> 02:10:58.599 align:start position:0%
allowing me to speak today the Coalition
 
02:11:00.870 --> 02:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
is the umbrella Organization for our 12
 
02:11:02.830 --> 02:11:02.840 align:start position:0%
community- based crisis centers that
 
02:11:05.589 --> 02:11:05.599 align:start position:0%
serve uh roughly 14,000 victims of
 
02:11:07.430 --> 02:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
Domestic and Sexual Violence each year
 
02:11:09.830 --> 02:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
and that's adults and children um I'm
 
02:11:12.510 --> 02:11:12.520 align:start position:0%
here to testify in support of SB
 
02:11:15.310 --> 02:11:15.320 align:start position:0%
459 um I will try to keep it brief as I
 
02:11:17.629 --> 02:11:17.639 align:start position:0%
think folks before me were very um
 
02:11:19.629 --> 02:11:19.639 align:start position:0%
thorough in their analysis we supported
 
02:11:21.950 --> 02:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
the underlying bill um think this is a
 
02:11:24.350 --> 02:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
really important initiative um and
 
02:11:26.430 --> 02:11:26.440 align:start position:0%
specifically um just echoing what the
 
02:11:28.549 --> 02:11:28.559 align:start position:0%
office of the child advocate said we
 
02:11:30.189 --> 02:11:30.199 align:start position:0%
really think it's essential that the
 
02:11:31.910 --> 02:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
definitions of abuse and neglect get
 
02:11:33.830 --> 02:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
looked at um we think there's a lot of
 
02:11:36.189 --> 02:11:36.199 align:start position:0%
opportunity to strengthen them um and
 
02:11:38.709 --> 02:11:38.719 align:start position:0%
also have um an interest in um
 
02:11:40.549 --> 02:11:40.559 align:start position:0%
maintaining the rebuttable presumption
 
02:11:43.830 --> 02:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
of harm in domestic violence cases um
 
02:11:46.109 --> 02:11:46.119 align:start position:0%
adverse and traumatic experiences in a
 
02:11:48.069 --> 02:11:48.079 align:start position:0%
person's childhood such as exposure to
 
02:11:50.030 --> 02:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
domestic violence can place individuals
 
02:11:52.109 --> 02:11:52.119 align:start position:0%
at an increased risk for chronic health
 
02:11:54.350 --> 02:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
problems um mental illness and substance
 
02:11:57.229 --> 02:11:57.239 align:start position:0%
use in adulthood so identifying these
 
02:11:59.549 --> 02:11:59.559 align:start position:0%
adverse childhood experiences or Aces
 
02:12:01.390 --> 02:12:01.400 align:start position:0%
and creating support for children at an
 
02:12:03.830 --> 02:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
early age is really critical um to
 
02:12:06.270 --> 02:12:06.280 align:start position:0%
Breaking the cycle of abuse um while we
 
02:12:08.030 --> 02:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
have long recognized that child abuse
 
02:12:09.830 --> 02:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
causes long-term effects for the child
 
02:12:11.669 --> 02:12:11.679 align:start position:0%
we have been slower to recognize that
 
02:12:13.669 --> 02:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
the very same effects are suffered by
 
02:12:16.149 --> 02:12:16.159 align:start position:0%
children who do not experience physical
 
02:12:19.350 --> 02:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
violence um so growing up in a household
 
02:12:21.390 --> 02:12:21.400 align:start position:0%
witnessing violence can also have ffect
 
02:12:23.430 --> 02:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
their emotional psychological and mental
 
02:12:26.669 --> 02:12:26.679 align:start position:0%
well-being um as the former presenters
 
02:12:28.830 --> 02:12:28.840 align:start position:0%
uh shared um and so for those reasons we
 
02:12:30.910 --> 02:12:30.920 align:start position:0%
really think it's important that we look
 
02:12:32.709 --> 02:12:32.719 align:start position:0%
um to broadening that definition to
 
02:12:35.350 --> 02:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
consider those emotional um and
 
02:12:37.830 --> 02:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
psychological factors um and
 
02:12:40.510 --> 02:12:40.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunately um and so we think that s
 
02:12:43.149 --> 02:12:43.159 align:start position:0%
SP 459 would really help pave the way um
 
02:12:45.549 --> 02:12:45.559 align:start position:0%
to having that conversation and change
 
02:12:46.910 --> 02:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
making this important change into
 
02:12:49.350 --> 02:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
statute um we have heard from countless
 
02:12:51.270 --> 02:12:51.280 align:start position:0%
victims that the strict interpretation
 
02:12:52.990 --> 02:12:53.000 align:start position:0%
the statute has had an impact on the
 
02:12:56.189 --> 02:12:56.199 align:start position:0%
ability to take the necessary actions in
 
02:12:58.750 --> 02:12:58.760 align:start position:0%
um to protect children who are at risk
 
02:13:00.950 --> 02:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
or are experiencing abuse um that have
 
02:13:03.790 --> 02:13:03.800 align:start position:0%
resulted in serious bodily injury that
 
02:13:06.910 --> 02:13:06.920 align:start position:0%
phrase is just a really high bar um and
 
02:13:09.109 --> 02:13:09.119 align:start position:0%
so by introducing a study committee sp
 
02:13:11.549 --> 02:13:11.559 align:start position:0%
sp 459 would recognizes that child abuse
 
02:13:13.629 --> 02:13:13.639 align:start position:0%
can take on many forms and doesn't
 
02:13:15.430 --> 02:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily need to result in physical
 
02:13:17.229 --> 02:13:17.239 align:start position:0%
injury in order to have long-term and
 
02:13:20.390 --> 02:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
devastating impacts um we see this often
 
02:13:22.310 --> 02:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
when working with victims who have been
 
02:13:24.390 --> 02:13:24.400 align:start position:0%
concerned about the abuser's behavior
 
02:13:27.350 --> 02:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
and treatment of um the child but
 
02:13:29.069 --> 02:13:29.079 align:start position:0%
because they had not been physically
 
02:13:30.950 --> 02:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
harmed the appropriate interventions are
 
02:13:33.830 --> 02:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
not taken to protect them um and so
 
02:13:35.390 --> 02:13:35.400 align:start position:0%
protective parents really should not be
 
02:13:37.310 --> 02:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
forced to wait for the unthinkable to
 
02:13:39.310 --> 02:13:39.320 align:start position:0%
happen to their child before they can
 
02:13:41.030 --> 02:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
act in the best interest of their safety
 
02:13:44.030 --> 02:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
so I think um just again would love to
 
02:13:45.589 --> 02:13:45.599 align:start position:0%
reiterate just how important it is that
 
02:13:48.069 --> 02:13:48.079 align:start position:0%
we're exploring this and um looking into
 
02:13:49.870 --> 02:13:49.880 align:start position:0%
responding to the appropriate patterns
 
02:13:51.629 --> 02:13:51.639 align:start position:0%
of behavior so that we can really take
 
02:13:53.950 --> 02:13:53.960 align:start position:0%
an intervention before something gets so
 
02:13:56.430 --> 02:13:56.440 align:start position:0%
severe um and then just briefly on the
 
02:13:59.430 --> 02:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
rebuttable presumption of harm um as was
 
02:14:01.870 --> 02:14:01.880 align:start position:0%
discussed in 2020 a law was passed um
 
02:14:03.350 --> 02:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
that Exempted victims of domestic
 
02:14:05.270 --> 02:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
violence from the rebuttable presumption
 
02:14:08.069 --> 02:14:08.079 align:start position:0%
of harm under specifically and narrowly
 
02:14:08.079 --> 02:14:09.229 align:start position:0%
of harm under specifically and narrowly
under

02:14:09.229 --> 02:14:09.239 align:start position:0%
under
 
02:14:11.750 --> 02:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
169c um and this pris provision will
 
02:14:14.350 --> 02:14:14.360 align:start position:0%
soon Sunset so we're hoping to see um s
 
02:14:18.069 --> 02:14:18.079 align:start position:0%
SP 498 move forward as well if not um in
 
02:14:21.229 --> 02:14:21.239 align:start position:0%
this bills um maintained in this bill um
 
02:14:22.589 --> 02:14:22.599 align:start position:0%
and I think this is just a really
 
02:14:25.589 --> 02:14:25.599 align:start position:0%
important provision um because it
 
02:14:27.910 --> 02:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
recognizes that the perpetrator alone is
 
02:14:29.750 --> 02:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
the cause of the dangerous environment
 
02:14:32.870 --> 02:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
um and in har in turn is um harming um
 
02:14:35.830 --> 02:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
resulting in the harm of a child um
 
02:14:37.589 --> 02:14:37.599 align:start position:0%
tactics such as making the victim feel
 
02:14:39.109 --> 02:14:39.119 align:start position:0%
guilty about how they care for their
 
02:14:40.790 --> 02:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
children or even threatening to take the
 
02:14:43.109 --> 02:14:43.119 align:start position:0%
children away or harm them can all be
 
02:14:45.109 --> 02:14:45.119 align:start position:0%
used by abusers to try to coerce the
 
02:14:47.270 --> 02:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
victim into staying in the relationship
 
02:14:49.069 --> 02:14:49.079 align:start position:0%
um the victim may not purposely be
 
02:14:51.589 --> 02:14:51.599 align:start position:0%
staying in a dangerous uh
 
02:14:53.990 --> 02:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
situation um to subject their child to
 
02:14:55.629 --> 02:14:55.639 align:start position:0%
domestic violence it just sometimes
 
02:14:58.069 --> 02:14:58.079 align:start position:0%
isn't safe for them to leave right away
 
02:15:00.270 --> 02:15:00.280 align:start position:0%
um and statistically um research shows
 
02:15:02.589 --> 02:15:02.599 align:start position:0%
that we the D the most dangerous time
 
02:15:04.830 --> 02:15:04.840 align:start position:0%
for um a victim is when they're trying
 
02:15:06.350 --> 02:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
to leave a relationship that's really
 
02:15:09.589 --> 02:15:09.599 align:start position:0%
when things escalate so um I think just
 
02:15:11.510 --> 02:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
having the opportunity to explore this
 
02:15:13.790 --> 02:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
to look into this and understand um the
 
02:15:15.510 --> 02:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
reality of what we're seeing in the
 
02:15:17.709 --> 02:15:17.719 align:start position:0%
state is just so critical um so I'll
 
02:15:19.270 --> 02:15:19.280 align:start position:0%
conclude there and I'd be happy to take
 
02:15:20.709 --> 02:15:20.719 align:start position:0%
any questions but I really appreciate
 
02:15:26.709 --> 02:15:26.719 align:start position:0%

today

02:15:28.310 --> 02:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:15:30.750 --> 02:15:30.760 align:start position:0%
wow I don't know if that's a good or bad
 
02:15:32.990 --> 02:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
thing but I appreciate your time it's
 
02:15:35.870 --> 02:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
good it's good stuff thank you for

interested on that study group it's
 
02:16:00.510 --> 02:16:00.520 align:start position:0%
going to be a lot of work but it's going
 
02:16:03.830 --> 02:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
to be well worth it wow okay uh maybe I
 
02:16:07.069 --> 02:16:07.079 align:start position:0%

03:36:19.710 --> 03:36:19.720 align:start position:0%
um announcing the meeting and we will be
 
03:36:24.590 --> 03:36:24.600 align:start position:0%
in Louisville Kentucky and um we have um
 
03:36:26.830 --> 03:36:26.840 align:start position:0%
uh within ncsl we also have a committee
 
03:36:28.990 --> 03:36:29.000 align:start position:0%
structure very similar to the
 
03:36:30.830 --> 03:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
legislature here and the general court
 
03:36:34.510 --> 03:36:34.520 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire where um we will
 
03:36:36.710 --> 03:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
um we do educational sessions so you get
 
03:36:38.070 --> 03:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to learn of what you
 
03:36:39.830 --> 03:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
know some hot topics and you give the
 
03:36:41.309 --> 03:36:41.319 align:start position:0%
opportunity to network with other
 
03:36:43.750 --> 03:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
legislators and staff from other states
 
03:36:45.750 --> 03:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
but also we develop position statements
 
03:36:47.750 --> 03:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
that my colleagues in our DC office will
 
03:36:51.030 --> 03:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
then use to do their La lobbying and
 
03:36:53.110 --> 03:36:53.120 align:start position:0%
advocacy on behalf of the states to the
 
03:36:55.389 --> 03:36:55.399 align:start position:0%
to the federal government and so and
 
03:36:57.550 --> 03:36:57.560 align:start position:0%
that's um through our standing committee
 
03:36:59.870 --> 03:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
um if a policy directive or policy
 
03:37:02.389 --> 03:37:02.399 align:start position:0%
resolution passes there and then it gets
 
03:37:05.189 --> 03:37:05.199 align:start position:0%
voted on by the um membership of ncsl
 
03:37:08.110 --> 03:37:08.120 align:start position:0%
and passes then um our position usually
 
03:37:11.429 --> 03:37:11.439 align:start position:0%
is you know boils down to um no unfunded
 
03:37:13.550 --> 03:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
mandates um don't preempt the states
 
03:37:15.229 --> 03:37:15.239 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing but um that's the
 
03:37:17.750 --> 03:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
work that my colleagues in our DC office
 
03:37:21.510 --> 03:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
do so um I'm happy anytime that you want

03:40:16.910 --> 03:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
um hoping that you will look favorably
 
03:40:20.510 --> 03:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
upon it it really is a way to resolve a
 
03:40:23.429 --> 03:40:23.439 align:start position:0%
problem that some of us have probably
 
03:40:26.630 --> 03:40:26.640 align:start position:0%
had and not necessarily been sure how do
 
03:40:30.429 --> 03:40:30.439 align:start position:0%
we um handle a situation in which we
 
03:40:33.429 --> 03:40:33.439 align:start position:0%
might be leaving our children for a very
 
03:40:36.070 --> 03:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
um for a short period of time in the
 
03:40:38.670 --> 03:40:38.680 align:start position:0%
care of another and I know many of us
 
03:40:42.150 --> 03:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
have written notes um to say that my
 
03:40:44.710 --> 03:40:44.720 align:start position:0%
mother had my mother my sister my
 
03:40:47.349 --> 03:40:47.359 align:start position:0%
neighbor has permission to seek care for
 
03:40:50.349 --> 03:40:50.359 align:start position:0%
my child or we we've done that because
 
03:40:54.510 --> 03:40:54.520 align:start position:0%
that is all we knew to do this allows
 
03:40:59.710 --> 03:40:59.720 align:start position:0%
for um a form to be created but for uh
 
03:41:04.590 --> 03:41:04.600 align:start position:0%
folks who wish to leave a child say uh a
 
03:41:07.229 --> 03:41:07.239 align:start position:0%
a couple chooses to go on vacation and
 
03:41:09.630 --> 03:41:09.640 align:start position:0%
is leaving their child in the care of a
 
03:41:11.830 --> 03:41:11.840 align:start position:0%
grandparent this
 
03:41:14.550 --> 03:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
recognizes that they are leaving the
 
03:41:17.150 --> 03:41:17.160 align:start position:0%
child in the care of a grandparent and
 
03:41:20.790 --> 03:41:20.800 align:start position:0%
the grandparent has certain rights um to
 
03:41:23.349 --> 03:41:23.359 align:start position:0%
make decisions during that period and
 
03:41:26.070 --> 03:41:26.080 align:start position:0%
mostly we're thinking about medical um
 
03:41:29.229 --> 03:41:29.239 align:start position:0%
emergency decisions and such um but it
 
03:41:31.830 --> 03:41:31.840 align:start position:0%
also would recognize things perhaps like
 
03:41:33.870 --> 03:41:33.880 align:start position:0%
picking the child up from school and
 
03:41:38.389 --> 03:41:38.399 align:start position:0%
other issues that would come up um when
 
03:41:43.070 --> 03:41:43.080 align:start position:0%
the bill was first filed uh we had some
 
03:41:46.189 --> 03:41:46.199 align:start position:0%
testimony from the coalition against
 
03:41:50.110 --> 03:41:50.120 align:start position:0%
Domestic and Sexual Violence and the uh
 
03:41:52.910 --> 03:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
Office of the child advocate that said
 
03:41:55.030 --> 03:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
well this is a good idea and you know
 
03:41:57.349 --> 03:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
people generally saw the need for it and
 
03:41:59.990 --> 03:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
recognized that it was a reasonable idea
 
03:42:02.070 --> 03:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
but we needed to put some safeguards in
 
03:42:05.269 --> 03:42:05.279 align:start position:0%
place to make sure that um this did not
 
03:42:08.070 --> 03:42:08.080 align:start position:0%
first interfere in any way with court
 
03:42:11.590 --> 03:42:11.600 align:start position:0%
appointed Guardianship and that it also
 
03:42:15.550 --> 03:42:15.560 align:start position:0%
uh recognized that there are uh
 
03:42:19.670 --> 03:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
situations where there are uh intense
 
03:42:22.110 --> 03:42:22.120 align:start position:0%
fighting or or disagreement between
 
03:42:24.630 --> 03:42:24.640 align:start position:0%
parents and we needed to make sure that
 
03:42:28.790 --> 03:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
no high-risk situations were created by
 
03:42:31.429 --> 03:42:31.439 align:start position:0%
us not including some language in this
 
03:42:35.910 --> 03:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
bill that would recognize um that folks
 
03:42:38.030 --> 03:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
who were in those situations being
 
03:42:40.710 --> 03:42:40.720 align:start position:0%
investigated for um abuse and neglect
 
03:42:44.590 --> 03:42:44.600 align:start position:0%
for example could not be um assigning
 
03:42:47.389 --> 03:42:47.399 align:start position:0%
their children to the care of another so
 
03:42:49.149 --> 03:42:49.159 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions but I
 
03:42:51.550 --> 03:42:51.560 align:start position:0%
also want to mention that my constituent
 
03:42:53.550 --> 03:42:53.560 align:start position:0%
who really was the impetus for this bill
 
03:42:57.189 --> 03:42:57.199 align:start position:0%
is here and um I'm sure can talk to you
 
03:42:59.630 --> 03:42:59.640 align:start position:0%
more about how this is handled in other
 
03:43:03.429 --> 03:43:03.439 align:start position:0%
states and why this is um a good New
 
03:43:06.590 --> 03:43:06.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh approach to doing this
 
03:43:10.990 --> 03:43:11.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:14.110 --> 03:43:14.120 align:start position:0%
senator seeing one uh representative
 
03:43:16.429 --> 03:43:16.439 align:start position:0%
Nelson thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
03:43:18.389 --> 03:43:18.399 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question it's a quick
 
03:43:23.269 --> 03:43:23.279 align:start position:0%
one um and I just wanted to um ask you
 
03:43:27.389 --> 03:43:27.399 align:start position:0%
if um both parents would need to um give
 
03:43:29.189 --> 03:43:29.199 align:start position:0%
permission for this to
 
03:43:31.469 --> 03:43:31.479 align:start position:0%
happen uh and I believe that is
 
03:43:31.479 --> 03:43:32.990 align:start position:0%
happen uh and I believe that is
addressed

03:43:32.990 --> 03:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
03:43:38.110 --> 03:43:38.120 align:start position:0%
in section three um lines 13 to 18 I
 
03:43:40.429 --> 03:43:40.439 align:start position:0%
believe says
 
03:43:44.429 --> 03:43:44.439 align:start position:0%
uh if there is no uh dealing with um
 
03:43:44.439 --> 03:43:46.790 align:start position:0%
uh if there is no uh dealing with um
when

03:43:46.790 --> 03:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
when
 
03:43:50.110 --> 03:43:50.120 align:start position:0%
if there the parents are not together
 
03:43:52.630 --> 03:43:52.640 align:start position:0%
and there's no parenting plan in place
 
03:43:55.070 --> 03:43:55.080 align:start position:0%
um a parent or Guardian may not appoint
 
03:43:57.309 --> 03:43:57.319 align:start position:0%
a temporary agent if the minor has
 
03:43:59.590 --> 03:43:59.600 align:start position:0%
another living par parent whose
 
03:44:01.750 --> 03:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
whereabouts are known and who is willing
 
03:44:03.870 --> 03:44:03.880 align:start position:0%
and able to safely provide care and
 
03:44:06.309 --> 03:44:06.319 align:start position:0%
custody for the minor unless the non-app
 
03:44:07.950 --> 03:44:07.960 align:start position:0%
appointing parent consents to the
 
03:44:12.149 --> 03:44:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:14.349 --> 03:44:14.359 align:start position:0%
writing any other questions
 
03:44:14.359 --> 03:44:16.229 align:start position:0%
writing any other questions
representative

03:44:16.229 --> 03:44:16.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:44:18.990 --> 03:44:19.000 align:start position:0%
Raymond thank you so I just want to make
 
03:44:20.710 --> 03:44:20.720 align:start position:0%
sure I thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
03:44:21.990 --> 03:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I just want
 
03:44:23.790 --> 03:44:23.800 align:start position:0%
to make sure I understand so
 
03:44:26.790 --> 03:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
currently um a parent does this already
 
03:44:28.910 --> 03:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
by typically they can write a letter
 
03:44:31.389 --> 03:44:31.399 align:start position:0%
sometimes they get it notorized Etc um
 
03:44:32.790 --> 03:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
we've done this in my family because I
 
03:44:35.149 --> 03:44:35.159 align:start position:0%
had surgery and my in-laws came to take
 
03:44:37.269 --> 03:44:37.279 align:start position:0%
care of myself and my kids while my
 
03:44:41.309 --> 03:44:41.319 align:start position:0%
husband was out of town um who this will
 
03:44:42.990 --> 03:44:43.000 align:start position:0%
change it so there's a like a standard
 
03:44:45.229 --> 03:44:45.239 align:start position:0%
form that someone could download we
 
03:44:48.429 --> 03:44:48.439 align:start position:0%
could create the form or we could just
 
03:44:48.439 --> 03:44:49.710 align:start position:0%
could create the form or we could just
have

03:44:49.710 --> 03:44:49.720 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:44:53.590 --> 03:44:53.600 align:start position:0%
this this law could exist as it is it
 
03:44:56.550 --> 03:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
gives it gives some um protection to the
 
03:44:58.710 --> 03:44:58.720 align:start position:0%
parent who leaves the child in the care
 
03:45:01.189 --> 03:45:01.199 align:start position:0%
of another and also some protection to
 
03:45:04.349 --> 03:45:04.359 align:start position:0%
the person with whom the child is left
 
03:45:08.510 --> 03:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:10.910 --> 03:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
you seeing no further questions thank
 
03:45:12.750 --> 03:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
you Senator and we will see you in
 
03:45:15.590 --> 03:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
judiciary very soon thanks a lot try not
 
03:45:17.790 --> 03:45:17.800 align:start position:0%
to have too much fun until we get
 
03:45:22.309 --> 03:45:22.319 align:start position:0%
there chair recognizes Peter
 
03:45:25.630 --> 03:45:25.640 align:start position:0%
mustus ammer and I believe you are the
 
03:45:28.070 --> 03:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
one the senator referenced as being a
 
03:45:31.189 --> 03:45:31.199 align:start position:0%
prime mover behind this
 
03:45:33.990 --> 03:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
Bill yes I am thank you Mr chairman and
 
03:45:36.630 --> 03:45:36.640 align:start position:0%
thank you representatives for hearing me
 
03:45:38.750 --> 03:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
and if I could uh briefly address
 
03:45:42.269 --> 03:45:42.279 align:start position:0%
Senator Raymond's question um right now
 
03:45:44.950 --> 03:45:44.960 align:start position:0%
people just write a note has no legal
 
03:45:47.389 --> 03:45:47.399 align:start position:0%
finding Authority so it means nothing
 
03:45:51.790 --> 03:45:51.800 align:start position:0%
this SB 574 would give some gravit some
 
03:45:56.790 --> 03:45:56.800 align:start position:0%
weight to that um s SP 574 is modeled
 
03:45:59.510 --> 03:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
after a Massachusetts General law which
 
03:46:00.950 --> 03:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
allows for the appointment of a
 
03:46:03.750 --> 03:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
temporary agent for minor a child or
 
03:46:06.349 --> 03:46:06.359 align:start position:0%
incapacitated per person but the
 
03:46:06.359 --> 03:46:08.070 align:start position:0%
incapacitated per person but the
Massachusetts

03:46:08.070 --> 03:46:08.080 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
03:46:10.389 --> 03:46:10.399 align:start position:0%
legislation that was modeled after the
 
03:46:13.189 --> 03:46:13.199 align:start position:0%
uniform probate codes provision so back
 
03:46:15.830 --> 03:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
in the 1950s 60s a bunch of Educators
 
03:46:17.349 --> 03:46:17.359 align:start position:0%
who got together and thought about
 
03:46:18.830 --> 03:46:18.840 align:start position:0%
what's the best way to treat this they
 
03:46:21.429 --> 03:46:21.439 align:start position:0%
came up with some model guidelines the
 
03:46:23.269 --> 03:46:23.279 align:start position:0%
majority of the states have adopted the
 
03:46:27.670 --> 03:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
model rule this s SP 574 is a bit more
 
03:46:29.590 --> 03:46:29.600 align:start position:0%
nuanced than the model rule the model
 
03:46:33.469 --> 03:46:33.479 align:start position:0%
rule is more vague it's two sentences
 
03:46:35.590 --> 03:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
and it can last for up to a period of
 
03:46:37.950 --> 03:46:37.960 align:start position:0%
two years in which you can give or
 
03:46:40.670 --> 03:46:40.680 align:start position:0%
delegate parental Authority s SP 574
 
03:46:43.269 --> 03:46:43.279 align:start position:0%
limits it to about 60 days if you need
 
03:46:45.550 --> 03:46:45.560 align:start position:0%
to reup it you can reup it by sign a new
 
03:46:48.910 --> 03:46:48.920 align:start position:0%
form um but this is something that is
 
03:46:51.070 --> 03:46:51.080 align:start position:0%
common throughout many states in the
 
03:46:53.229 --> 03:46:53.239 align:start position:0%
country New Hampshire is one of the few
 
03:46:55.309 --> 03:46:55.319 align:start position:0%
that does not have this I am a
 
03:46:56.710 --> 03:46:56.720 align:start position:0%
practicing attorney in both
 
03:46:59.670 --> 03:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and New Hampshire I have
 
03:47:02.710 --> 03:47:02.720 align:start position:0%
used the Massachusetts legislation to
 
03:47:05.670 --> 03:47:05.680 align:start position:0%
benefit many of my Massachusetts clients
 
03:47:06.990 --> 03:47:07.000 align:start position:0%
but when it comes to New Hampshire
 
03:47:09.070 --> 03:47:09.080 align:start position:0%
clients we are unable to use
 
03:47:13.469 --> 03:47:13.479 align:start position:0%
this the idea really is Mom and Dad want
 
03:47:15.670 --> 03:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
to leave their child with a grandparent
 
03:47:19.229 --> 03:47:19.239 align:start position:0%
or cousin or in my instance my brother
 
03:47:21.189 --> 03:47:21.199 align:start position:0%
and my sister-in-law have my kids for
 
03:47:23.750 --> 03:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
this school vacation week and should
 
03:47:26.389 --> 03:47:26.399 align:start position:0%
something happen to the kids if they
 
03:47:27.710 --> 03:47:27.720 align:start position:0%
need to go to the hospital and get
 
03:47:30.910 --> 03:47:30.920 align:start position:0%
emergency treatment this law would allow
 
03:47:35.910 --> 03:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:38.349 --> 03:47:38.359 align:start position:0%
treatment representative Panic with a
 
03:47:41.510 --> 03:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman um thank
 
03:47:44.070 --> 03:47:44.080 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question if we can
 
03:47:47.710 --> 03:47:47.720 align:start position:0%
already get an affidavit to cover that
 
03:47:52.070 --> 03:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
why would we need a law now sure that
 
03:47:54.389 --> 03:47:54.399 align:start position:0%
affidavit has no binding Authority or
 
03:47:58.070 --> 03:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
legal hold so it means
 
03:48:02.189 --> 03:48:02.199 align:start position:0%
nothing thank you representative Nelson
 
03:48:04.070 --> 03:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Mr chairman and thank you
 
03:48:05.750 --> 03:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my call I'm still a little
 
03:48:10.269 --> 03:48:10.279 align:start position:0%
bit stuck on um the language of lines 13
 
03:48:14.070 --> 03:48:14.080 align:start position:0%
through 18 um so if their parents are
 
03:48:18.110 --> 03:48:18.120 align:start position:0%
legally are together um both parents
 
03:48:20.670 --> 03:48:20.680 align:start position:0%
would have to sign off on um that
 
03:48:23.630 --> 03:48:23.640 align:start position:0%
they're giving permission for this um
 
03:48:27.229 --> 03:48:27.239 align:start position:0%
temporary agent um however this says
 
03:48:29.950 --> 03:48:29.960 align:start position:0%
that um if the parents have a parenting
 
03:48:34.990 --> 03:48:35.000 align:start position:0%
plan that the parent who um has the
 
03:48:37.750 --> 03:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
parenting time has the
 
03:48:41.870 --> 03:48:41.880 align:start position:0%
sole decision making um and you only
 
03:48:46.469 --> 03:48:46.479 align:start position:0%
need the one parent to give permission
 
03:48:50.229 --> 03:48:50.239 align:start position:0%
both parents won't have permission don't
 
03:48:53.750 --> 03:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
are not needed to have permission for um
 
03:48:56.030 --> 03:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
for placement is that that's what I'm
 
03:48:58.269 --> 03:48:58.279 align:start position:0%
reading here yeah so that was part of
 
03:49:01.349 --> 03:49:01.359 align:start position:0%
the amendment made after the Senate
 
03:49:04.670 --> 03:49:04.680 align:start position:0%
hearing and my understanding of that
 
03:49:08.349 --> 03:49:08.359 align:start position:0%
provision is it's intended to say
 
03:49:10.070 --> 03:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
child's on your parenting time go ahead
 
03:49:12.510 --> 03:49:12.520 align:start position:0%
and make a plan and you can go ahead and
 
03:49:13.870 --> 03:49:13.880 align:start position:0%
decide what should happen since you
 
03:49:15.870 --> 03:49:15.880 align:start position:0%
already have parent in time
 
03:49:18.269 --> 03:49:18.279 align:start position:0%
availability there are paragraphs
 
03:49:22.429 --> 03:49:22.439 align:start position:0%
further down that try to protect and say
 
03:49:25.710 --> 03:49:25.720 align:start position:0%
certain times you cannot appoint someone
 
03:49:29.189 --> 03:49:29.199 align:start position:0%
to receive the care of your child so if
 
03:49:32.990 --> 03:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
you're parenting time your call if it's
 
03:49:35.149 --> 03:49:35.159 align:start position:0%
co-parenting time both parents my
 
03:49:37.750 --> 03:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:41.510 --> 03:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
approve followup I did read thank you
 
03:49:43.149 --> 03:49:43.159 align:start position:0%
for thank you and thank you for taking
 
03:49:45.349 --> 03:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
my next question I'm sorry I did uh read
 
03:49:48.030 --> 03:49:48.040 align:start position:0%
further down and this is um this would
 
03:49:49.790 --> 03:49:49.800 align:start position:0%
be like in you know surrender of
 
03:49:51.469 --> 03:49:51.479 align:start position:0%
parental rights or in a in a high
 
03:49:53.630 --> 03:49:53.640 align:start position:0%
conflict situation or whatever but if
 
03:49:55.510 --> 03:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
it's um if it's a
 
03:49:59.070 --> 03:49:59.080 align:start position:0%
um harmonious um parenting plan but one
 
03:50:03.670 --> 03:50:03.680 align:start position:0%
parent uh just disagrees uh with a
 
03:50:07.469 --> 03:50:07.479 align:start position:0%
placement um that will not be
 
03:50:11.510 --> 03:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
regarded um at all um um I believe that
 
03:50:15.189 --> 03:50:15.199 align:start position:0%
was one of the primary concerns from the
 
03:50:17.229 --> 03:50:17.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Coalition from Domestic
 
03:50:19.349 --> 03:50:19.359 align:start position:0%
and Sexual Violence and the child
 
03:50:22.189 --> 03:50:22.199 align:start position:0%
advocate for New Hampshire and they were
 
03:50:24.309 --> 03:50:24.319 align:start position:0%
most concerned of that and they're the
 
03:50:27.189 --> 03:50:27.199 align:start position:0%
ones who drafted this piece in there to
 
03:50:29.750 --> 03:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
fit that concern so I think it takes
 
03:50:32.950 --> 03:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:37.349 --> 03:50:37.359 align:start position:0%
it any further questions representative
 
03:50:39.910 --> 03:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
deimon thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
03:50:42.670 --> 03:50:42.680 align:start position:0%
you for taking my
 
03:50:47.030 --> 03:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:50.389 --> 03:50:50.399 align:start position:0%
so we have parents who really don't want
 
03:50:51.389 --> 03:50:51.399 align:start position:0%
to be
 
03:50:53.309 --> 03:50:53.319 align:start position:0%
parents but they don't want to go
 
03:50:56.469 --> 03:50:56.479 align:start position:0%
through the expense of putting their
 
03:50:59.309 --> 03:50:59.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:03.550 --> 03:51:03.560 align:start position:0%
adoption so they use
 
03:51:07.189 --> 03:51:07.199 align:start position:0%
this which says not for a period not
 
03:51:10.429 --> 03:51:10.439 align:start position:0%
exceeding 60
 
03:51:13.510 --> 03:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
days so I'm one of those parents I'm not
 
03:51:13.520 --> 03:51:15.149 align:start position:0%
days so I'm one of those parents I'm not
but

03:51:15.149 --> 03:51:15.159 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:51:20.030 --> 03:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
I give my kids to you for 60 days on the
 
03:51:23.030 --> 03:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
60th day you bring them back to me they
 
03:51:25.349 --> 03:51:25.359 align:start position:0%
spend two nights with me and then I call
 
03:51:28.189 --> 03:51:28.199 align:start position:0%
you and say come get your kids and for
 
03:51:31.550 --> 03:51:31.560 align:start position:0%
60 more days they go and stay with
 
03:51:34.670 --> 03:51:34.680 align:start position:0%
you and you're not a good person cuz you
 
03:51:36.269 --> 03:51:36.279 align:start position:0%
know that I'm not a really good person
 
03:51:38.630 --> 03:51:38.640 align:start position:0%
with these kids and maybe you're sex
 
03:51:41.469 --> 03:51:41.479 align:start position:0%
trafficking these kids how do we prevent
 
03:51:43.910 --> 03:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
that with this I think you have the same
 
03:51:45.830 --> 03:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
problem now regardless of whether this
 
03:51:53.229 --> 03:51:53.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:56.030 --> 03:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
that I I don't have the answer to that
 
03:51:57.950 --> 03:51:57.960 align:start position:0%
question that's a good question thank
 
03:52:00.030 --> 03:52:00.040 align:start position:0%

03:52:18.110 --> 03:52:18.120 align:start position:0%
being here so I I guess I you know I'm
 
03:52:19.429 --> 03:52:19.439 align:start position:0%
sitting here and i' I've done these
 
03:52:21.229 --> 03:52:21.239 align:start position:0%
things before like notorized documents
 
03:52:23.389 --> 03:52:23.399 align:start position:0%
and stuff you know like I'm going to be
 
03:52:26.750 --> 03:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
gone my kids are with my dad this is my
 
03:52:30.790 --> 03:52:30.800 align:start position:0%
insurance information so tell me without
 
03:52:33.870 --> 03:52:33.880 align:start position:0%
this law that happens my kids break
 
03:52:36.870 --> 03:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
their arm my dad takes them to the
 
03:52:40.429 --> 03:52:40.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:43.830 --> 03:52:43.840 align:start position:0%
um and he has this this notorized say
 
03:52:45.910 --> 03:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
why is that not binding like what
 
03:52:48.429 --> 03:52:48.439 align:start position:0%
happens then like they're they're they
 
03:52:50.870 --> 03:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
can't be cared for like what is tell me
 
03:52:52.269 --> 03:52:52.279 align:start position:0%
what happens in that scenario without
 
03:52:54.990 --> 03:52:55.000 align:start position:0%
this law yeah without this law the
 
03:52:57.550 --> 03:52:57.560 align:start position:0%
doctors have every Power in the world to
 
03:53:00.910 --> 03:53:00.920 align:start position:0%
say I can't treat this child because
 
03:53:04.630 --> 03:53:04.640 align:start position:0%
there is no law requiring me or there's
 
03:53:07.790 --> 03:53:07.800 align:start position:0%
no Authority there by this person to
 
03:53:10.830 --> 03:53:10.840 align:start position:0%

03:53:13.630 --> 03:53:13.640 align:start position:0%
um the medical treatment for the child
 
03:53:15.590 --> 03:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
it's just a notor piece of paper anyone
 
03:53:17.550 --> 03:53:17.560 align:start position:0%
can Noize anything doesn't mean there's
 
03:53:20.149 --> 03:53:20.159 align:start position:0%
gravitas or legal Authority behind it

life example not just a idea that it
 
03:53:32.070 --> 03:53:32.080 align:start position:0%
could happen where this has been a
 
03:53:33.590 --> 03:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
problem and this has actually like
 
03:53:35.910 --> 03:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
happened like that it that it really did
 
03:53:38.189 --> 03:53:38.199 align:start position:0%
that doctors really were like no or can
 
03:53:43.030 --> 03:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:46.429 --> 03:53:46.439 align:start position:0%
example uh yes um one of the other
 
03:53:49.830 --> 03:53:49.840 align:start position:0%
people who are here to talk has a real
 
03:53:54.189 --> 03:53:54.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:57.870 --> 03:53:57.880 align:start position:0%

representative

03:54:01.389 --> 03:54:01.399 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:54:04.269 --> 03:54:04.279 align:start position:0%
Panic thank you Vice chair for allowing
 
03:54:07.830 --> 03:54:07.840 align:start position:0%
me to ask a question so what you're
 
03:54:11.550 --> 03:54:11.560 align:start position:0%
saying to this whole committee is that
 
03:54:15.189 --> 03:54:15.199 align:start position:0%
an affidavit a notorized affid
 
03:54:18.389 --> 03:54:18.399 align:start position:0%
David is
 
03:54:18.399 --> 03:54:19.950 align:start position:0%
David is
worthless

03:54:19.950 --> 03:54:19.960 align:start position:0%
worthless
 
03:54:22.469 --> 03:54:22.479 align:start position:0%
yes when you have so the what's the
 
03:54:27.389 --> 03:54:27.399 align:start position:0%
point of even having notary republics so
 
03:54:29.590 --> 03:54:29.600 align:start position:0%
when you have a notorized affidavit it
 
03:54:32.349 --> 03:54:32.359 align:start position:0%
needs to point to some kind of law it
 
03:54:34.110 --> 03:54:34.120 align:start position:0%
needs to say this is the law I'm
 
03:54:36.910 --> 03:54:36.920 align:start position:0%
referring to and I'm I want so and so to
 
03:54:40.510 --> 03:54:40.520 align:start position:0%
happen based on law XYZ uh for example
 
03:54:42.830 --> 03:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
let's say it's a HIPPA release form you
 
03:54:44.950 --> 03:54:44.960 align:start position:0%
sign a HIPPA form you get it not I
 
03:54:46.790 --> 03:54:46.800 align:start position:0%
that's fine but you're giving someone
 
03:54:49.149 --> 03:54:49.159 align:start position:0%
the authority to have your Healthcare
 
03:54:53.469 --> 03:54:53.479 align:start position:0%
information based on the 1996 Hippa law
 
03:54:55.990 --> 03:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
you can if you are writing something
 
03:54:58.990 --> 03:54:59.000 align:start position:0%
down and just saying I wish for this to
 
03:55:01.710 --> 03:55:01.720 align:start position:0%
happen without any kind of law like this
 
03:55:05.670 --> 03:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
in place to say there is a something we
 
03:55:07.870 --> 03:55:07.880 align:start position:0%
are pointing to that the state
 
03:55:10.030 --> 03:55:10.040 align:start position:0%
specifically allows for such a thing to
 
03:55:13.830 --> 03:55:13.840 align:start position:0%
occur it it is meaningless and a notary
 
03:55:15.429 --> 03:55:15.439 align:start position:0%
whether it's motorized or not the
 
03:55:19.229 --> 03:55:19.239 align:start position:0%
substance of it there is no uh gravitas
 
03:55:24.030 --> 03:55:24.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:27.149 --> 03:55:27.159 align:start position:0%
it thank you France M that
 
03:55:30.030 --> 03:55:30.040 align:start position:0%
a thank you Mr chairman uh quick
 
03:55:32.510 --> 03:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
question where would uh parents uh get
 
03:55:35.030 --> 03:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
this uh form how do they download it how
 
03:55:37.229 --> 03:55:37.239 align:start position:0%
do they become aware that it even exists
 
03:55:42.030 --> 03:55:42.040 align:start position:0%
sure sure um that I leave to you all and
 
03:55:44.950 --> 03:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
my hope is that there is a form attached
 
03:55:47.070 --> 03:55:47.080 align:start position:0%
to the legislation that can just be
 
03:55:48.790 --> 03:55:48.800 align:start position:0%
downloaded just like we do with the
 
03:55:50.429 --> 03:55:50.439 align:start position:0%
power of attorneys now or the power of
 
03:55:52.510 --> 03:55:52.520 align:start position:0%
attorney for healthcare there is a state
 
03:55:54.229 --> 03:55:54.239 align:start position:0%
prolongated form that people can just
 
03:55:56.349 --> 03:55:56.359 align:start position:0%
download off the internet and use and my
 
03:55:58.149 --> 03:55:58.159 align:start position:0%
hope would be that you know whether it's
 
03:56:00.349 --> 03:56:00.359 align:start position:0%
this piece of legislation or if there's
 
03:56:01.990 --> 03:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
something down the line that that does
 
03:56:03.630 --> 03:56:03.640 align:start position:0%
happen it just makes it easier if people
 
03:56:07.590 --> 03:56:07.600 align:start position:0%

03:56:30.990 --> 03:56:31.000 align:start position:0%
having me my name is Danielle Chrisman I
 
03:56:33.030 --> 03:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
am a resident of New Hampshire and a
 
03:56:35.110 --> 03:56:35.120 align:start position:0%
mother of four minor
 
03:56:38.790 --> 03:56:38.800 align:start position:0%
children my parents live in Kansas and
 
03:56:41.630 --> 03:56:41.640 align:start position:0%
every summer a couple of my kids will go
 
03:56:44.870 --> 03:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
spend about a month with them
 
03:56:46.750 --> 03:56:46.760 align:start position:0%
and so that's kind of where this came
 
03:56:48.710 --> 03:56:48.720 align:start position:0%
about because a couple years ago I said
 
03:56:50.710 --> 03:56:50.720 align:start position:0%
hey Peter is this something you can do
 
03:56:53.830 --> 03:56:53.840 align:start position:0%
for me and he said no because there's no
 
03:56:57.590 --> 03:56:57.600 align:start position:0%
law that says the doctor has to follow
 
03:57:01.189 --> 03:57:01.199 align:start position:0%
these wishes like okay we are lucky
 
03:57:03.149 --> 03:57:03.159 align:start position:0%
enough to be a military family so I just
 
03:57:04.990 --> 03:57:05.000 align:start position:0%
went on down to hands gum and had the
 
03:57:07.790 --> 03:57:07.800 align:start position:0%

04:29:53.229 --> 04:29:53.239 align:start position:0%
welfare bill can I ask you to suspend
 
04:29:55.109 --> 04:29:55.119 align:start position:0%

properly open the meeting thank you for
 
04:30:00.269 --> 04:30:00.279 align:start position:0%

04:30:04.349 --> 04:30:04.359 align:start position:0%
uh and the hearings on Senate Bill 417
 
04:30:07.870 --> 04:30:07.880 align:start position:0%
FN and uh Senator Whitley is the prime
 
04:30:09.590 --> 04:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
sponsor and thank you so much for
 
04:30:12.790 --> 04:30:12.800 align:start position:0%
indulging me go ahead my pleasure
 
04:30:16.790 --> 04:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
so um 417 is a very comprehensive it's a
 
04:30:18.750 --> 04:30:18.760 align:start position:0%
big Bill I do understand there's a whole
 
04:30:21.189 --> 04:30:21.199 align:start position:0%
lot of policy in here I will do some
 
04:30:23.030 --> 04:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
introductions of the bill but there are
 
04:30:25.590 --> 04:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
people behind me that have worked very
 
04:30:27.030 --> 04:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
hard on the version that you see in
 
04:30:29.149 --> 04:30:29.159 align:start position:0%
front of you and they can do the sort of
 
04:30:31.149 --> 04:30:31.159 align:start position:0%
Deep dive into every single provision
 
04:30:33.910 --> 04:30:33.920 align:start position:0%
and how we got in there but generally it
 
04:30:36.070 --> 04:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
it's a bill that advances strategies
 
04:30:38.070 --> 04:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
based on solid evidence and I think
 
04:30:40.309 --> 04:30:40.319 align:start position:0%
that's how we should be legislating with
 
04:30:41.750 --> 04:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
evidence that we know is going to keep
 
04:30:43.630 --> 04:30:43.640 align:start position:0%
our children
 
04:30:47.229 --> 04:30:47.239 align:start position:0%
safe so um many of the changes that you
 
04:30:51.389 --> 04:30:51.399 align:start position:0%
see here um were sort of uh put under
 
04:30:53.990 --> 04:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
scrutiny in the Senate and there was a
 
04:30:55.910 --> 04:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
whole lot of work done there was a very
 
04:30:58.229 --> 04:30:58.239 align:start position:0%
collaborative process between the office
 
04:31:00.750 --> 04:31:00.760 align:start position:0%
of child advocate the advoc the other
 
04:31:02.830 --> 04:31:02.840 align:start position:0%
Advocates child Advocates and then the
 
04:31:04.510 --> 04:31:04.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
04:31:06.149 --> 04:31:06.159 align:start position:0%
so I just did want to note that there's
 
04:31:08.109 --> 04:31:08.119 align:start position:0%
been a lot of collaborative work here
 
04:31:11.469 --> 04:31:11.479 align:start position:0%
done so as this committee may know my
 
04:31:14.109 --> 04:31:14.119 align:start position:0%
life work as a lawyer as an advocate and
 
04:31:16.149 --> 04:31:16.159 align:start position:0%
now as a state senator has been on
 
04:31:18.910 --> 04:31:18.920 align:start position:0%
strengthening families building stronger
 
04:31:21.070 --> 04:31:21.080 align:start position:0%
communities and ensuring access to
 
04:31:23.710 --> 04:31:23.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity because it is very true that
 
04:31:25.910 --> 04:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
children and young people need all three
 
04:31:28.790 --> 04:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
to succeed in particular I do feel that
 
04:31:31.429 --> 04:31:31.439 align:start position:0%
we have a moral obligation as Leaders to
 
04:31:33.870 --> 04:31:33.880 align:start position:0%
support vulnerable Children and Families
 
04:31:37.189 --> 04:31:37.199 align:start position:0%
an obligation that very seriously as I
 
04:31:40.710 --> 04:31:40.720 align:start position:0%
know so many of you do also so this
 
04:31:44.309 --> 04:31:44.319 align:start position:0%
legislation was in response to a pretty
 
04:31:46.950 --> 04:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
horrific situation that all of us are
 
04:31:49.349 --> 04:31:49.359 align:start position:0%
aware of in August 2023 there was an
 
04:31:51.030 --> 04:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
investigation by the office of child
 
04:31:53.790 --> 04:31:53.800 align:start position:0%
advocate and a detailed report on the
 
04:31:55.990 --> 04:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
mistreatment of New Hampshire youth plac
 
04:32:00.389 --> 04:32:00.399 align:start position:0%
at the bledo Youth Academy in Gallatin
 
04:32:02.870 --> 04:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
Tennessee so as you may know when
 
04:32:04.750 --> 04:32:04.760 align:start position:0%
children are involved with the division
 
04:32:06.269 --> 04:32:06.279 align:start position:0%
of children youth and families
 
04:32:07.950 --> 04:32:07.960 align:start position:0%
developmental services or Bureau of
 
04:32:10.070 --> 04:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
children's Behavioral Health and require
 
04:32:13.149 --> 04:32:13.159 align:start position:0%
out of home placement and Foster CR may
 
04:32:15.910 --> 04:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
not you know be specifically a match for
 
04:32:17.870 --> 04:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
them due to certain Behavioral or
 
04:32:20.070 --> 04:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
developmental or mental health needs
 
04:32:22.030 --> 04:32:22.040 align:start position:0%
they are often placed in outof state
 
04:32:25.269 --> 04:32:25.279 align:start position:0%
residential facilities uh in there are
 
04:32:27.070 --> 04:32:27.080 align:start position:0%
some that are placed in state but there
 
04:32:29.070 --> 04:32:29.080 align:start position:0%
is still the case that many of our
 
04:32:33.429 --> 04:32:33.439 align:start position:0%
children who are are most V to out ofate
 
04:32:37.030 --> 04:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
facilities Out Of Reach for Advocates
 
04:32:40.189 --> 04:32:40.199 align:start position:0%
Out Of Reach For Families communities
 
04:32:42.990 --> 04:32:43.000 align:start position:0%
and folks who are here to keep children
 
04:32:45.389 --> 04:32:45.399 align:start position:0%
safe these facilities are intended to
 
04:32:47.630 --> 04:32:47.640 align:start position:0%
serve as a temporary residence with
 
04:32:49.510 --> 04:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
therapeutic treatment to assist the
 
04:32:51.349 --> 04:32:51.359 align:start position:0%
child in gaining skills to better manage
 
04:32:53.550 --> 04:32:53.560 align:start position:0%
their behaviors and emotions so they can
 
04:32:56.149 --> 04:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
return to a community setting that's the
 
04:32:58.229 --> 04:32:58.239 align:start position:0%
goal to get them back in their
 
04:33:00.630 --> 04:33:00.640 align:start position:0%
communities back with their
 
04:33:03.469 --> 04:33:03.479 align:start position:0%
families prior to placing children out
 
04:33:06.551 --> 04:33:06.561 align:start position:0%
of state or in residential facilities
 
04:33:09.390 --> 04:33:09.400 align:start position:0%
all family Foster and instate options
 
04:33:12.510 --> 04:33:12.520 align:start position:0%
are supposed to be exhausted this is
 
04:33:14.750 --> 04:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
because many children referred to
 
04:33:16.670 --> 04:33:16.680 align:start position:0%
Residential Treatment have suffered
 
04:33:18.789 --> 04:33:18.799 align:start position:0%
years of trauma due to exposure to
 
04:33:22.189 --> 04:33:22.199 align:start position:0%
substance use Mental Illness domestic
 
04:33:24.470 --> 04:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
violence and abuse and neglect by
 
04:33:24.480 --> 04:33:26.029 align:start position:0%
violence and abuse and neglect by
primary

04:33:26.029 --> 04:33:26.039 align:start position:0%
primary
 
04:33:28.269 --> 04:33:28.279 align:start position:0%
caretakers again these are our most
 
04:33:28.279 --> 04:33:29.470 align:start position:0%
caretakers again these are our most
vulnerable

04:33:29.470 --> 04:33:29.480 align:start position:0%
vulnerable
 
04:33:32.269 --> 04:33:32.279 align:start position:0%
children tragically the oca's report
 
04:33:34.789 --> 04:33:34.799 align:start position:0%
detailed deeply upsetting and troubling
 
04:33:36.910 --> 04:33:36.920 align:start position:0%
conditions faced by the New Hampshire
 
04:33:39.150 --> 04:33:39.160 align:start position:0%
children at this Tennessee facility
 
04:33:41.230 --> 04:33:41.240 align:start position:0%
including reports from children that sta
 
04:33:43.390 --> 04:33:43.400 align:start position:0%
staff off offered them incentives to
 
04:33:45.789 --> 04:33:45.799 align:start position:0%
assault other children cameras in
 
04:33:47.470 --> 04:33:47.480 align:start position:0%
bedrooms leaving children with little
 
04:33:50.189 --> 04:33:50.199 align:start position:0%
privacy to change and children suffering
 
04:33:52.629 --> 04:33:52.639 align:start position:0%
rug Burns while restrained face down on
 
04:33:56.150 --> 04:33:56.160 align:start position:0%
a carpet again our most vulnerable
 
04:33:58.830 --> 04:33:58.840 align:start position:0%
children the oca's report detailed that
 
04:34:01.230 --> 04:34:01.240 align:start position:0%
the facility appeared dirty had little
 
04:34:03.990 --> 04:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
Recreation space and was defined by a
 
04:34:07.590 --> 04:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
culture of Shame humiliation and
 
04:34:07.600 --> 04:34:09.109 align:start position:0%
culture of Shame humiliation and
inhumane

04:34:09.109 --> 04:34:09.119 align:start position:0%
inhumane
 
04:34:11.949 --> 04:34:11.959 align:start position:0%
punishment as an example the OCA noted
 
04:34:13.429 --> 04:34:13.439 align:start position:0%
in her report that the staff at the
 
04:34:15.590 --> 04:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
Tennesseee facility could not explain
 
04:34:17.789 --> 04:34:17.799 align:start position:0%
the complicated point system that
 
04:34:19.750 --> 04:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
determines a child's Privileges and
 
04:34:21.750 --> 04:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
punishments she noted children were
 
04:34:24.709 --> 04:34:24.719 align:start position:0%
dressed in colorcoded jumpsuits based on
 
04:34:27.269 --> 04:34:27.279 align:start position:0%
behavioral needs or punishments A system
 
04:34:29.510 --> 04:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
that commun communicated personal
 
04:34:33.470 --> 04:34:33.480 align:start position:0%
information to all staff and kids just
 
04:34:35.551 --> 04:34:35.561 align:start position:0%
humiliating it's important to note that
 
04:34:37.109 --> 04:34:37.119 align:start position:0%
this all occurred in the context of
 
04:34:38.949 --> 04:34:38.959 align:start position:0%
ongoing litigation against the state
 
04:34:40.830 --> 04:34:40.840 align:start position:0%
where plaintiffs are alleging that the
 
04:34:43.429 --> 04:34:43.439 align:start position:0%
state is over over reliant on congregate
 
04:34:45.109 --> 04:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
or institutional
 
04:34:47.269 --> 04:34:47.279 align:start position:0%
settings now I just want to point out
 
04:34:49.429 --> 04:34:49.439 align:start position:0%
the bill before you does not address
 
04:34:51.310 --> 04:34:51.320 align:start position:0%
every single problem identified in the
 
04:34:53.869 --> 04:34:53.879 align:start position:0%
bled Soo report but it is a very
 
04:34:56.910 --> 04:34:56.920 align:start position:0%
critical First Step experts tell us that
 
04:34:59.470 --> 04:34:59.480 align:start position:0%
the most effective way to help children
 
04:35:01.470 --> 04:35:01.480 align:start position:0%
is to involve them with their families
 
04:35:03.590 --> 04:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
friends community members and
 
04:35:05.750 --> 04:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
Professionals in all the decisions
 
04:35:08.349 --> 04:35:08.359 align:start position:0%
related to at of Home
 
04:35:12.029 --> 04:35:12.039 align:start position:0%
placement so specifically this legisl
 
04:35:13.789 --> 04:35:13.799 align:start position:0%
codifies certain
 
04:35:16.670 --> 04:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
policies um prioritizes keeping children
 
04:35:18.349 --> 04:35:18.359 align:start position:0%
with their family and in their
 
04:35:19.789 --> 04:35:19.799 align:start position:0%
communities those are the broad
 
04:35:22.150 --> 04:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
principles that we're working on from
 
04:35:24.429 --> 04:35:24.439 align:start position:0%
here the bill also strengthens the
 
04:35:26.150 --> 04:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
existing statutory preference for
 
04:35:27.750 --> 04:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
instate placement of New Hampshire
 
04:35:29.510 --> 04:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
children removed from their homes and
 
04:35:31.029 --> 04:35:31.039 align:start position:0%
strengthens the requirements around
 
04:35:33.109 --> 04:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
residential placement of those
 
04:35:35.230 --> 04:35:35.240 align:start position:0%
children and also strengthens the
 
04:35:36.789 --> 04:35:36.799 align:start position:0%
existing mandate for siblings to be
 
04:35:38.189 --> 04:35:38.199 align:start position:0%
placed together when removed from the
 
04:35:39.789 --> 04:35:39.799 align:start position:0%
home and a whole host of other things
 
04:35:41.670 --> 04:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
again that the folks behind me will who
 
04:35:42.990 --> 04:35:43.000 align:start position:0%
have worked very hard to put this
 
04:35:44.470 --> 04:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
comprehensive Bill
 
04:35:47.429 --> 04:35:47.439 align:start position:0%
together can can speak to further I want
 
04:35:48.590 --> 04:35:48.600 align:start position:0%
to thank
 
04:35:51.629 --> 04:35:51.639 align:start position:0%
DHHS the office of child advocate and
 
04:35:54.590 --> 04:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
the jrpg the group of Advocates Fierce
 
04:35:56.590 --> 04:35:56.600 align:start position:0%
advocates for their commitment to
 
04:35:58.429 --> 04:35:58.439 align:start position:0%
children and their ongoing work on this
 
04:36:01.109 --> 04:36:01.119 align:start position:0%
bill to ensure it adequately protects
 
04:36:02.750 --> 04:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
children thank you for your
 
04:36:05.670 --> 04:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
consideration of s417 I'm happy to take
 
04:36:08.390 --> 04:36:08.400 align:start position:0%

grateful for the work done to support
 
04:37:29.150 --> 04:37:29.160 align:start position:0%
the children of New Hampshire and
 
04:37:29.160 --> 04:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
the children of New Hampshire and
residential

04:37:32.560 --> 04:37:32.570 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:32.570 --> 04:37:35.070 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

04:37:35.070 --> 04:37:35.080 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
04:37:37.230 --> 04:37:37.240 align:start position:0%
placements um so as you heard I won't
 
04:37:40.150 --> 04:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
get too deep into the details um of the
 
04:37:42.470 --> 04:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
report from bledo youth acad as we heard
 
04:37:45.109 --> 04:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
a bit here already from Senator Whitley
 
04:37:46.551 --> 04:37:46.561 align:start position:0%
um but that really was the impetus to
 
04:37:49.150 --> 04:37:49.160 align:start position:0%
this bill knowing that um unfortunately
 
04:37:51.310 --> 04:37:51.320 align:start position:0%
children suffered quite a bit of trauma
 
04:37:52.310 --> 04:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
at that
 
04:37:54.750 --> 04:37:54.760 align:start position:0%
facility after already being traumatized
 
04:37:56.390 --> 04:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
in their in their home environments
 
04:37:59.070 --> 04:37:59.080 align:start position:0%
prior and um we know this is not a
 
04:38:01.029 --> 04:38:01.039 align:start position:0%
standalone unfortunately as was also
 
04:38:02.830 --> 04:38:02.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned there are many lawsuits this
 
04:38:06.189 --> 04:38:06.199 align:start position:0%
has been an ongoing issue um where we
 
04:38:07.949 --> 04:38:07.959 align:start position:0%
don't always see the most adequate level
 
04:38:09.750 --> 04:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
of care provided to our highest need
 
04:38:13.029 --> 04:38:13.039 align:start position:0%
children who are placed in residential
 
04:38:15.869 --> 04:38:15.879 align:start position:0%
facilities um I will get into the bill a
 
04:38:17.830 --> 04:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
bit for you um hoping to break down the
 
04:38:19.349 --> 04:38:19.359 align:start position:0%
different sections and explain a bit
 
04:38:20.949 --> 04:38:20.959 align:start position:0%
more the importance Behind these
 
04:38:23.310 --> 04:38:23.320 align:start position:0%
different sections that we have here so
 
04:38:25.590 --> 04:38:25.600 align:start position:0%
the first section of the bill
 
04:38:27.830 --> 04:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
strengthens the language
 
04:38:30.949 --> 04:38:30.959 align:start position:0%
around when a child would be appropriate
 
04:38:33.910 --> 04:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
for residential placement we do
 
04:38:34.990 --> 04:38:35.000 align:start position:0%
understand I believe it was mentioned
 
04:38:38.551 --> 04:38:38.561 align:start position:0%
earlier today that we place quite a bit
 
04:38:40.990 --> 04:38:41.000 align:start position:0%
of children in residential care here in
 
04:38:42.629 --> 04:38:42.639 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the last update that I
 
04:38:45.590 --> 04:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
have from DHHS was on Friday at the
 
04:38:46.830 --> 04:38:46.840 align:start position:0%
oversight Commission on children's
 
04:38:50.109 --> 04:38:50.119 align:start position:0%
services and at that time just under 30%
 
04:38:51.990 --> 04:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
of children in placement are placed in
 
04:38:54.470 --> 04:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
residential care that is much higher
 
04:38:56.670 --> 04:38:56.680 align:start position:0%
than our neighboring states and much
 
04:39:00.070 --> 04:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
higher than the majority of the country
 
04:39:02.629 --> 04:39:02.639 align:start position:0%
and we truly do need to take action to
 
04:39:04.029 --> 04:39:04.039 align:start position:0%
reduce that ensure that the care that
 
04:39:05.789 --> 04:39:05.799 align:start position:0%
children are receiving residential is
 
04:39:08.109 --> 04:39:08.119 align:start position:0%
adequate it does meet their needs and it
 
04:39:11.029 --> 04:39:11.039 align:start position:0%
is shortterm so that first section there
 
04:39:12.709 --> 04:39:12.719 align:start position:0%
really focuses on that and ensuring that
 
04:39:13.990 --> 04:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
children are going to placements that
 
04:39:15.551 --> 04:39:15.561 align:start position:0%
are tailored to meet their particular
 
04:39:18.590 --> 04:39:18.600 align:start position:0%
needs and that they will move on to a
 
04:39:20.709 --> 04:39:20.719 align:start position:0%
more approp appropriate community- based
 
04:39:24.269 --> 04:39:24.279 align:start position:0%
placement when their treatment has been
 
04:39:26.349 --> 04:39:26.359 align:start position:0%
completed section two addresses the
 
04:39:28.830 --> 04:39:28.840 align:start position:0%
issues of siblings and placement um
 
04:39:31.551 --> 04:39:31.561 align:start position:0%
although it is DCF policy we still do
 
04:39:33.269 --> 04:39:33.279 align:start position:0%
observe cases where children are
 
04:39:35.789 --> 04:39:35.799 align:start position:0%
separated from their siblings um we did
 
04:39:38.670 --> 04:39:38.680 align:start position:0%
have a case this fall which resolved
 
04:39:41.150 --> 04:39:41.160 align:start position:0%
early this year in January where there
 
04:39:43.030 --> 04:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
were were three siblings that were
 
04:39:44.788 --> 04:39:44.798 align:start position:0%
placed separately two of them were
 
04:39:46.830 --> 04:39:46.840 align:start position:0%
placed together one was placed in a
 
04:39:49.708 --> 04:39:49.718 align:start position:0%
separate foster home the entire time the
 
04:39:51.030 --> 04:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
office of the child advocate was working
 
04:39:53.510 --> 04:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
with this Sibling Group they continued
 
04:39:56.150 --> 04:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
to advocate for wanting to be together
 
04:39:58.030 --> 04:39:58.040 align:start position:0%
They begged and pleaded anybody and
 
04:40:00.990 --> 04:40:01.000 align:start position:0%
everybody that they could speak to to
 
04:40:02.550 --> 04:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
show the importance of that sibling
 
04:40:04.110 --> 04:40:04.120 align:start position:0%
relationship and show that they have
 
04:40:06.390 --> 04:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
such close bonds that that outweighs any
 
04:40:09.948 --> 04:40:09.958 align:start position:0%
permanency for any of them ultimately
 
04:40:11.628 --> 04:40:11.638 align:start position:0%
the older children were able to to speak
 
04:40:14.390 --> 04:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
to the judge and voice their interest in
 
04:40:15.550 --> 04:40:15.560 align:start position:0%
being placed together with their
 
04:40:18.788 --> 04:40:18.798 align:start position:0%
siblings and ultimately it was after
 
04:40:20.430 --> 04:40:20.440 align:start position:0%
this presentation to the court that the
 
04:40:22.110 --> 04:40:22.120 align:start position:0%
judge ruled that there should be another
 
04:40:23.628 --> 04:40:23.638 align:start position:0%
matching meeting for permanency for
 
04:40:25.590 --> 04:40:25.600 align:start position:0%
these children and the consideration of
 
04:40:27.390 --> 04:40:27.400 align:start position:0%
their sibling Bond needed to be in the
 
04:40:30.110 --> 04:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
Forefront it took Court action to get
 
04:40:32.590 --> 04:40:32.600 align:start position:0%
there we should not require that action
 
04:40:34.270 --> 04:40:34.280 align:start position:0%
these children spent months apart from
 
04:40:36.230 --> 04:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
each other worrying about the safety of
 
04:40:38.590 --> 04:40:38.600 align:start position:0%
their younger sibling our children need
 
04:40:40.510 --> 04:40:40.520 align:start position:0%
to be with siblings whenever possible
 
04:40:44.070 --> 04:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
this would codify in law and Beyond the
 
04:40:45.830 --> 04:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
policy it would enforce that the agency
 
04:40:46.868 --> 04:40:46.878 align:start position:0%
needs to
 
04:40:48.788 --> 04:40:48.798 align:start position:0%
follow the policy around keeping
 
04:40:50.628 --> 04:40:50.638 align:start position:0%
siblings together unless there is a
 
04:40:53.070 --> 04:40:53.080 align:start position:0%
safety issue of course there is there
 
04:40:55.070 --> 04:40:55.080 align:start position:0%
are going to be circumstances where
 
04:40:56.830 --> 04:40:56.840 align:start position:0%
children may not be safe to be with each
 
04:40:58.390 --> 04:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
other they may need treatment before
 
04:40:59.750 --> 04:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
coming back
 
04:41:01.910 --> 04:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
together but unless there is this
 
04:41:04.030 --> 04:41:04.040 align:start position:0%
outlying safety issue we should always
 
04:41:07.070 --> 04:41:07.080 align:start position:0%
be prioritizing that sibling
 
04:41:11.030 --> 04:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
Bond section three addresses an issues
 
04:41:12.708 --> 04:41:12.718 align:start position:0%
that we have seen with non-custodial
 
04:41:16.708 --> 04:41:16.718 align:start position:0%
parents so this section here truly is to
 
04:41:19.590 --> 04:41:19.600 align:start position:0%
address what we have learned from the
 
04:41:21.070 --> 04:41:21.080 align:start position:0%
office of child advocate in
 
04:41:23.150 --> 04:41:23.160 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts in response to the harmony
 
04:41:25.230 --> 04:41:25.240 align:start position:0%
Montgomery case what we learned in
 
04:41:26.948 --> 04:41:26.958 align:start position:0%
response to that case from their office
 
04:41:28.110 --> 04:41:28.120 align:start position:0%
is that the
 
04:41:31.910 --> 04:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
court plac the child with the father
 
04:41:34.830 --> 04:41:34.840 align:start position:0%
without doing due diligence into the
 
04:41:36.990 --> 04:41:37.000 align:start position:0%
father's Fitness without the state of
 
04:41:38.708 --> 04:41:38.718 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire being able to complete a
 
04:41:41.750 --> 04:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
home study and ensure that the home and
 
04:41:42.948 --> 04:41:42.958 align:start position:0%
the other adults living in the home
 
04:41:45.190 --> 04:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
would be safe for this child because at
 
04:41:46.830 --> 04:41:46.840 align:start position:0%
that time the judge determined that New
 
04:41:49.990 --> 04:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state law did not require that
 
04:41:53.310 --> 04:41:53.320 align:start position:0%
level of review of of a biological
 
04:41:55.670 --> 04:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
parent so leaning on New Hampshire state
 
04:41:58.270 --> 04:41:58.280 align:start position:0%
law that judge sent Harmony to live with
 
04:42:00.430 --> 04:42:00.440 align:start position:0%
her father and we all know the gruesome
 
04:42:03.830 --> 04:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
outcome for that child and in the spirit
 
04:42:06.550 --> 04:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
of learning from issues that have
 
04:42:08.030 --> 04:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
occurred in our state and wanting to
 
04:42:10.868 --> 04:42:10.878 align:start position:0%
protect children took this opportunity
 
04:42:13.150 --> 04:42:13.160 align:start position:0%
while looking at this area of Statute to
 
04:42:15.470 --> 04:42:15.480 align:start position:0%
say now is the time to act on this and
 
04:42:18.788 --> 04:42:18.798 align:start position:0%
really ensure that DCF can have an
 
04:42:21.868 --> 04:42:21.878 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do a full view into the
 
04:42:24.430 --> 04:42:24.440 align:start position:0%
non-custodial non- accused parent ensure
 
04:42:27.270 --> 04:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
that they understand the child not only
 
04:42:29.270 --> 04:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
the child but also their unique needs
 
04:42:30.750 --> 04:42:30.760 align:start position:0%
and can represent to the court that they
 
04:42:33.550 --> 04:42:33.560 align:start position:0%
can meet those unique needs and can
 
04:42:35.670 --> 04:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
provide for safety of that child before
 
04:42:37.868 --> 04:42:37.878 align:start position:0%
the child is sent to live with them so
 
04:42:39.270 --> 04:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
this is a very critical piece of the
 
04:42:40.868 --> 04:42:40.878 align:start position:0%
bill I do want to make sure it is very
 
04:42:44.110 --> 04:42:44.120 align:start position:0%
clear that this is specific to 169c
 
04:42:46.590 --> 04:42:46.600 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect cases this would not
 
04:42:53.628 --> 04:42:53.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:58.670 --> 04:42:58.680 align:start position:0%
courts in section four um we add section
 
04:43:04.868 --> 04:43:04.878 align:start position:0%
g and H into 169 c19 so the new section
 
04:43:08.590 --> 04:43:08.600 align:start position:0%
169 c19 G that we're looking to add here
 
04:43:11.230 --> 04:43:11.240 align:start position:0%
is taking a look at State sanctioned
 
04:43:13.750 --> 04:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
evaluations and examinations of children
 
04:43:15.110 --> 04:43:15.120 align:start position:0%
in state
 
04:43:18.510 --> 04:43:18.520 align:start position:0%
care currently there are programs that
 
04:43:20.788 --> 04:43:20.798 align:start position:0%
do Assessments in the state and when
 
04:43:23.190 --> 04:43:23.200 align:start position:0%
they're doing their assessments they are
 
04:43:26.270 --> 04:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
the outcome is to inform next treatment
 
04:43:28.470 --> 04:43:28.480 align:start position:0%
steps for that child some of these
 
04:43:31.070 --> 04:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
programs are known as cast programs
 
04:43:32.628 --> 04:43:32.638 align:start position:0%
comprehensive assessment and short-term
 
04:43:34.270 --> 04:43:34.280 align:start position:0%
treatment the child is residing at the
 
04:43:35.830 --> 04:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
program while they're having assessments
 
04:43:38.550 --> 04:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
done by staff there and talking with an
 
04:43:41.430 --> 04:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
expert in the field in New Hampshire we
 
04:43:43.350 --> 04:43:43.360 align:start position:0%
learned that often times these
 
04:43:46.110 --> 04:43:46.120 align:start position:0%
assessments are done by lower level
 
04:43:48.390 --> 04:43:48.400 align:start position:0%
clinicians that are not trained to do
 
04:43:51.708 --> 04:43:51.718 align:start position:0%
person personality level assessments
 
04:43:53.910 --> 04:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
those are those should be done by a
 
04:43:56.628 --> 04:43:56.638 align:start position:0%
psychologist and particularly one who
 
04:43:59.270 --> 04:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
has an expertise in childhood trauma
 
04:44:02.510 --> 04:44:02.520 align:start position:0%
what we see when these are done by
 
04:44:05.788 --> 04:44:05.798 align:start position:0%
non-qualified individuals is that the
 
04:44:09.788 --> 04:44:09.798 align:start position:0%
ratings can at times um have negative
 
04:44:12.110 --> 04:44:12.120 align:start position:0%
implications on the child placement they
 
04:44:13.830 --> 04:44:13.840 align:start position:0%
may rate the child to have a personality
 
04:44:15.350 --> 04:44:15.360 align:start position:0%
disorder that a psychologist is saying
 
04:44:17.430 --> 04:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
is not accurate and now that is going to
 
04:44:19.070 --> 04:44:19.080 align:start position:0%
follow the child to whatever next
 
04:44:21.150 --> 04:44:21.160 align:start position:0%
placement they're seeking to get into
 
04:44:23.070 --> 04:44:23.080 align:start position:0%
and many times it can disqualify them
 
04:44:25.788 --> 04:44:25.798 align:start position:0%
from placements because of what is in
 
04:44:27.750 --> 04:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
that write up and so in working very
 
04:44:29.070 --> 04:44:29.080 align:start position:0%
closely with this
 
04:44:32.670 --> 04:44:32.680 align:start position:0%
expert she came to us with some language
 
04:44:35.070 --> 04:44:35.080 align:start position:0%
that would assert that it is if if those
 
04:44:36.750 --> 04:44:36.760 align:start position:0%
personality measures are going to be
 
04:44:38.868 --> 04:44:38.878 align:start position:0%
used that they are completed by a
 
04:44:41.030 --> 04:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
psychologist who has the experience who
 
04:44:42.948 --> 04:44:42.958 align:start position:0%
who takes very who takes it very
 
04:44:44.628 --> 04:44:44.638 align:start position:0%
seriously that these are measures that
 
04:44:46.670 --> 04:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
will follow the child and ensures not to
 
04:44:50.350 --> 04:44:50.360 align:start position:0%
put anything in writing that would lead
 
04:44:52.030 --> 04:44:52.040 align:start position:0%
to the child being denied from
 
04:44:53.948 --> 04:44:53.958 align:start position:0%
placements in the future but rather
 
04:44:57.150 --> 04:44:57.160 align:start position:0%
allow to allow the opportunity to speak
 
04:44:58.868 --> 04:44:58.878 align:start position:0%
to maybe some behaviors and
 
04:45:01.590 --> 04:45:01.600 align:start position:0%
personalities that they're seeing um but
 
04:45:01.600 --> 04:45:02.788 align:start position:0%
personalities that they're seeing um but
not

04:45:02.788 --> 04:45:02.798 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:45:05.510 --> 04:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
diagnosing that child in that moment
 
04:45:06.628 --> 04:45:06.638 align:start position:0%
particularly when it's short-term
 
04:45:08.990 --> 04:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
personality disorders need a lot longer
 
04:45:11.110 --> 04:45:11.120 align:start position:0%
time to be spent with the clinician for
 
04:45:13.030 --> 04:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
to be able to assess and and meet that
 
04:45:15.190 --> 04:45:15.200 align:start position:0%
level and so this this cleans up that
 
04:45:17.470 --> 04:45:17.480 align:start position:0%
assessment process and leads to
 
04:45:18.750 --> 04:45:18.760 align:start position:0%
hopefully would lead to better outcomes
 
04:45:20.590 --> 04:45:20.600 align:start position:0%
for our children and getting thorough
 
04:45:22.390 --> 04:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
assessments by an appropriate level
 
04:45:24.750 --> 04:45:24.760 align:start position:0%
clinician who can then make treatment
 
04:45:26.708 --> 04:45:26.718 align:start position:0%
recommendations that will provide the
 
04:45:27.990 --> 04:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
right level of care for that child
 
04:45:28.000 --> 04:45:30.310 align:start position:0%
right level of care for that child
moving

04:45:30.310 --> 04:45:30.320 align:start position:0%
moving
 
04:45:35.708 --> 04:45:35.718 align:start position:0%
forward section H is 169 c198 is the
 
04:45:38.430 --> 04:45:38.440 align:start position:0%
order of pref preference for out of home
 
04:45:42.830 --> 04:45:42.840 align:start position:0%
placement this is the core of this bill
 
04:45:45.390 --> 04:45:45.400 align:start position:0%
um is around this placement preference
 
04:45:48.628 --> 04:45:48.638 align:start position:0%
this speaks to the importance of keeping
 
04:45:50.230 --> 04:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
children intact with their families
 
04:45:52.470 --> 04:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
whenever possible and it aligns with the
 
04:45:54.830 --> 04:45:54.840 align:start position:0%
mission and the vision of DCF where they
 
04:45:57.030 --> 04:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
do seek to keep families intact and
 
04:45:59.390 --> 04:45:59.400 align:start position:0%
intact and provide services to meet
 
04:46:01.390 --> 04:46:01.400 align:start position:0%
those family needs before having to
 
04:46:03.910 --> 04:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
remove children from the home but if
 
04:46:05.670 --> 04:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
that is unable to be accomplished it
 
04:46:07.350 --> 04:46:07.360 align:start position:0%
speaks in an order of preference for
 
04:46:10.390 --> 04:46:10.400 align:start position:0%
placing a child and that begins with the
 
04:46:12.750 --> 04:46:12.760 align:start position:0%
placement with a kin somebody who the
 
04:46:14.230 --> 04:46:14.240 align:start position:0%
child is familiar with that would be
 
04:46:16.628 --> 04:46:16.638 align:start position:0%
inclusive of fictive kin so anyone who
 
04:46:18.310 --> 04:46:18.320 align:start position:0%
the child has a a pre-existing
 
04:46:19.670 --> 04:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
relationship with it could also be
 
04:46:20.788 --> 04:46:20.798 align:start position:0%
someone who has a pre-existing
 
04:46:23.670 --> 04:46:23.680 align:start position:0%
relationship with the family
 
04:46:26.390 --> 04:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
system and as well as blood relatives
 
04:46:28.910 --> 04:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
after kin then we get into foster care
 
04:46:30.310 --> 04:46:30.320 align:start position:0%
options and it speaks a lot about
 
04:46:34.190 --> 04:46:34.200 align:start position:0%
proximity proximity Is key because our
 
04:46:35.430 --> 04:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
children when they are pulled away from
 
04:46:37.190 --> 04:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
their homes they lose all of those
 
04:46:38.830 --> 04:46:38.840 align:start position:0%
connections that they have they lose
 
04:46:41.390 --> 04:46:41.400 align:start position:0%
friendships they lose trusting adults
 
04:46:43.070 --> 04:46:43.080 align:start position:0%
all of those people that are are looking
 
04:46:44.910 --> 04:46:44.920 align:start position:0%
out for them protectively are now
 
04:46:46.548 --> 04:46:46.558 align:start position:0%
stripped from their lives if we can keep
 
04:46:48.470 --> 04:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
them in foster homes or kinship
 
04:46:51.430 --> 04:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
placements that are in close proximity
 
04:46:54.190 --> 04:46:54.200 align:start position:0%
to their home where they came first had
 
04:46:56.470 --> 04:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
come from then easing back into that
 
04:46:58.590 --> 04:46:58.600 align:start position:0%
setting in the future should be easier
 
04:47:01.190 --> 04:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
friendships would be there schooling and
 
04:47:03.350 --> 04:47:03.360 align:start position:0%
trusted professionals at school will be
 
04:47:05.270 --> 04:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
there ready to support the family as
 
04:47:08.470 --> 04:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
that child transitions back home and it
 
04:47:10.628 --> 04:47:10.638 align:start position:0%
speaks to Leading down to residential
 
04:47:14.270 --> 04:47:14.280 align:start position:0%
place placement being the highest level
 
04:47:17.430 --> 04:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
and only necessary and appropriate level
 
04:47:19.750 --> 04:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
of placement if that child's needs
 
04:47:22.150 --> 04:47:22.160 align:start position:0%
require it and again pointing to the
 
04:47:24.788 --> 04:47:24.798 align:start position:0%
importance of that short-term treatment
 
04:47:27.628 --> 04:47:27.638 align:start position:0%
episode and then the child to return to
 
04:47:30.590 --> 04:47:30.600 align:start position:0%
a community-based setting um there is
 
04:47:34.390 --> 04:47:34.400 align:start position:0%
also a note in there about um the
 
04:47:36.110 --> 04:47:36.120 align:start position:0%
preferred age of the of children we have
 
04:47:38.708 --> 04:47:38.718 align:start position:0%
seen some very young children um end up
 
04:47:41.030 --> 04:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
in residential care as young as 5 and
 
04:47:44.830 --> 04:47:44.840 align:start position:0%
six years old um not necessarily a
 
04:47:47.750 --> 04:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
healthy placement setting for them and
 
04:47:49.830 --> 04:47:49.840 align:start position:0%
ideally we would like it to be framed
 
04:47:53.510 --> 04:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
for children in the older years who are
 
04:47:56.590 --> 04:47:56.600 align:start position:0%
able to accept the treatment and move on
 
04:48:00.350 --> 04:48:00.360 align:start position:0%
from that and so ideally it should be 12
 
04:48:02.910 --> 04:48:02.920 align:start position:0%
or above that is the the um National
 
04:48:04.590 --> 04:48:04.600 align:start position:0%
Standard at this point for and there are
 
04:48:06.750 --> 04:48:06.760 align:start position:0%
some states that have actually outruled
 
04:48:09.590 --> 04:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
um any placement outside of a home like
 
04:48:11.990 --> 04:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
setting for children who are Under 12 um
 
04:48:13.470 --> 04:48:13.480 align:start position:0%
we are not looking to go that far at
 
04:48:15.270 --> 04:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
this point um because we do understand
 
04:48:16.628 --> 04:48:16.638 align:start position:0%
that there are some children with very
 
04:48:18.990 --> 04:48:19.000 align:start position:0%
high needs um and are younger children
 
04:48:20.628 --> 04:48:20.638 align:start position:0%
are presenting with higher needs sooner
 
04:48:23.070 --> 04:48:23.080 align:start position:0%
than they had before um but like to keep
 
04:48:25.628 --> 04:48:25.638 align:start position:0%
in mind that um the age of the child in
 
04:48:27.110 --> 04:48:27.120 align:start position:0%
the environment that they're exposed to
 
04:48:29.110 --> 04:48:29.120 align:start position:0%
will have implications for them future
 
04:48:30.750 --> 04:48:30.760 align:start position:0%
down the
 
04:48:33.190 --> 04:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
line um section five talks to some
 
04:48:36.190 --> 04:48:36.200 align:start position:0%
changes as for the standard return to
 
04:48:39.470 --> 04:48:39.480 align:start position:0%
home and this shift is truly just to
 
04:48:41.670 --> 04:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
ensure that when when looking to return
 
04:48:42.708 --> 04:48:42.718 align:start position:0%
a child
 
04:48:45.910 --> 04:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
home that um the child is returning to a
 
04:48:48.150 --> 04:48:48.160 align:start position:0%
parent who is safe and able to care for
 
04:48:50.070 --> 04:48:50.080 align:start position:0%
them and able to provide for them
 
04:48:54.430 --> 04:48:54.440 align:start position:0%
currently in statute it is based off of
 
04:48:57.390 --> 04:48:57.400 align:start position:0%
the the reason for the child coming into
 
04:49:00.110 --> 04:49:00.120 align:start position:0%
care and has the parent made changes to
 
04:49:03.510 --> 04:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
show that those issues no longer exist
 
04:49:05.390 --> 04:49:05.400 align:start position:0%
yes that is important but in keeping
 
04:49:07.868 --> 04:49:07.878 align:start position:0%
with trauma informed care it also needs
 
04:49:09.470 --> 04:49:09.480 align:start position:0%
to be an environment that is going to
 
04:49:11.350 --> 04:49:11.360 align:start position:0%
meet that child's need
 
04:49:13.110 --> 04:49:13.120 align:start position:0%
and when children do come into care they
 
04:49:15.270 --> 04:49:15.280 align:start position:0%
suffer additional trauma their needs do
 
04:49:17.150 --> 04:49:17.160 align:start position:0%
increase and so the parent may do some
 
04:49:19.390 --> 04:49:19.400 align:start position:0%
great work on themselves but have they
 
04:49:21.270 --> 04:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
done the work to know where their child
 
04:49:24.230 --> 04:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
is at now and what ability do they have
 
04:49:26.310 --> 04:49:26.320 align:start position:0%
to meet that need and so that's where
 
04:49:28.070 --> 04:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
the focus is making it a more holistic
 
04:49:29.548 --> 04:49:29.558 align:start position:0%
view where it's not just based off the
 
04:49:31.150 --> 04:49:31.160 align:start position:0%
parent but it's also based off that
 
04:49:32.708 --> 04:49:32.718 align:start position:0%

forward so please feel free to join me
 
04:49:44.110 --> 04:49:44.120 align:start position:0%
like to introduce yourself Lisa massio

Advocate and apologies running in from
the

04:49:50.350 --> 04:49:50.360 align:start position:0%
the

Senate who said I couldn't be two places
 
04:49:52.760 --> 04:49:56.070 align:start position:0%
Senate who said I couldn't be two places
at

04:49:56.070 --> 04:49:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:58.590 --> 04:49:58.600 align:start position:0%
once um and so it is important to note
 
04:49:58.600 --> 04:49:59.510 align:start position:0%
once um and so it is important to note
um

04:49:59.510 --> 04:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:02.750 --> 04:50:02.760 align:start position:0%
in section six um it mirrors the
 
04:50:06.548 --> 04:50:06.558 align:start position:0%
language of Section 1 and four into RSA
 
04:50:09.670 --> 04:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
169f the importance of creating that in
 
04:50:13.110 --> 04:50:13.120 align:start position:0%
169f is to ensure that these Provisions
 
04:50:15.590 --> 04:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
for um placement
 
04:50:19.990 --> 04:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
preference also impact children in 169b
 
04:50:21.708 --> 04:50:21.718 align:start position:0%
and D cases so those are children
 
04:50:23.430 --> 04:50:23.440 align:start position:0%
involved with Juvenile Justice as well
 
04:50:25.708 --> 04:50:25.718 align:start position:0%
as the children in need of services all
 
04:50:26.948 --> 04:50:26.958 align:start position:0%
children who could end up in a
 
04:50:28.470 --> 04:50:28.480 align:start position:0%
residential placement should have the
 
04:50:30.230 --> 04:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
equal opportunity to be in a community
 
04:50:32.230 --> 04:50:32.240 align:start position:0%
setting first so we wanted to make sure
 
04:50:34.030 --> 04:50:34.040 align:start position:0%
that this was not
 
04:50:36.590 --> 04:50:36.600 align:start position:0%
only having an impact on children in
 
04:50:47.030 --> 04:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:52.948 --> 04:50:52.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:57.670 --> 04:50:57.680 align:start position:0%
breath so also in section six um there
 
04:51:00.150 --> 04:51:00.160 align:start position:0%
are two new sections which you may
 
04:51:04.948 --> 04:51:04.958 align:start position:0%
recognize originally were um attached to
 
04:51:07.390 --> 04:51:07.400 align:start position:0%
1573 where I just
 
04:51:11.030 --> 04:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
was so um they were moved over here into
 
04:51:13.430 --> 04:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
s417 because there was a lot of cross
 
04:51:15.390 --> 04:51:15.400 align:start position:0%
references to the increased oversight
 
04:51:16.830 --> 04:51:16.840 align:start position:0%
and it sort of made more sense to have
 
04:51:20.030 --> 04:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
them on this bill so and we did do quite
 
04:51:23.670 --> 04:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
a bit of work with DHHS and the judicial
 
04:51:28.270 --> 04:51:28.280 align:start position:0%
um Branch inhouse Finance for 1573 so
 
04:51:30.948 --> 04:51:30.958 align:start position:0%
these two sections have actually been
 
04:51:32.708 --> 04:51:32.718 align:start position:0%
pretty substantially revised from when
 
04:51:36.670 --> 04:51:36.680 align:start position:0%
you lost last saw them back in February
 
04:51:41.070 --> 04:51:41.080 align:start position:0%
to balance the load on current worker
 
04:51:43.670 --> 04:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
with the safety of the children
 
04:51:46.708 --> 04:51:46.718 align:start position:0%
so looking at them uh the language has
 
04:51:48.670 --> 04:51:48.680 align:start position:0%
been shifted a little bit but these
 
04:51:51.510 --> 04:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
monthly visits from dcyf workers if you
 
04:51:54.310 --> 04:51:54.320 align:start position:0%
recall from our blood Soo report there
 
04:51:56.868 --> 04:51:56.878 align:start position:0%
had been seven workers at that facility
 
04:51:59.110 --> 04:51:59.120 align:start position:0%
over seven months none of whom raised a
 
04:52:02.470 --> 04:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
red flag about what was going on there
 
04:52:05.390 --> 04:52:05.400 align:start position:0%
so after talks with the division with
 
04:52:08.230 --> 04:52:08.240 align:start position:0%
workers with bcbh decided that that was
 
04:52:10.110 --> 04:52:10.120 align:start position:0%
a place that could make change fairly
 
04:52:11.868 --> 04:52:11.878 align:start position:0%
easily these monthly visits are already
 
04:52:13.750 --> 04:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
happening they're paying the workers
 
04:52:16.590 --> 04:52:16.600 align:start position:0%
they're paying for the travel but by
 
04:52:18.510 --> 04:52:18.520 align:start position:0%
refining that section making sure it's a
 
04:52:20.470 --> 04:52:20.480 align:start position:0%
worker that the child knows either the
 
04:52:22.470 --> 04:52:22.480 align:start position:0%
worker assigned to that child or someone
 
04:52:23.868 --> 04:52:23.878 align:start position:0%
who knows the child it could have been
 
04:52:25.310 --> 04:52:25.320 align:start position:0%
the assessment worker could be a
 
04:52:27.390 --> 04:52:27.400 align:start position:0%
supervisor but having that trusted
 
04:52:29.230 --> 04:52:29.240 align:start position:0%
relationship is a lot more likely for
 
04:52:31.430 --> 04:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
that child to feel comfortable to make
 
04:52:34.110 --> 04:52:34.120 align:start position:0%
disclosures about what's going on in
 
04:52:36.670 --> 04:52:36.680 align:start position:0%
addition um we found out at bledo that
 
04:52:38.948 --> 04:52:38.958 align:start position:0%
the visits were about 15 minutes long
 
04:52:40.670 --> 04:52:40.680 align:start position:0%
they took place in just a little
 
04:52:43.390 --> 04:52:43.400 align:start position:0%
conference room off the lobby with the
 
04:52:45.230 --> 04:52:45.240 align:start position:0%
kid who with a person they'd never seen
 
04:52:47.948 --> 04:52:47.958 align:start position:0%
before so we did want to enhance those
 
04:52:49.430 --> 04:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
visits and this isn't to say most
 
04:52:51.230 --> 04:52:51.240 align:start position:0%
workers don't do this I mean a lot of
 
04:52:53.470 --> 04:52:53.480 align:start position:0%
workers we talk to already do this
 
04:52:54.910 --> 04:52:54.920 align:start position:0%
you're walking around the facility
 
04:52:55.990 --> 04:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
because you want to make sure to see
 
04:52:57.510 --> 04:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
where the child is sleeping where
 
04:52:59.390 --> 04:52:59.400 align:start position:0%
they're eating if there's education
 
04:53:01.270 --> 04:53:01.280 align:start position:0%
there while you're walking it's either a
 
04:53:02.868 --> 04:53:02.878 align:start position:0%
member of leadership or a Direct Care
 
04:53:04.628 --> 04:53:04.638 align:start position:0%
staff walking with you you're chatting
 
04:53:06.708 --> 04:53:06.718 align:start position:0%
how's the kid doing how's your program
 
04:53:08.150 --> 04:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
culture what kind of disciplinary
 
04:53:10.788 --> 04:53:10.798 align:start position:0%
tactics do you use wanting to see any
 
04:53:13.030 --> 04:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
seclusion or quiet rooms in the facility
 
04:53:15.628 --> 04:53:15.638 align:start position:0%
is very important so we worked that into
 
04:53:17.270 --> 04:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
the language here to make sure that it's
 
04:53:19.788 --> 04:53:19.798 align:start position:0%
clear and also created a new form in
 
04:53:23.230 --> 04:53:23.240 align:start position:0%
conjunction between DHHS and OCA to make
 
04:53:24.628 --> 04:53:24.638 align:start position:0%
sure that everyone knows what they need
 
04:53:26.030 --> 04:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
to be doing and it's being done
 
04:53:27.990 --> 04:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
consistently for the safety and Welfare
 
04:53:31.510 --> 04:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
of that child the last uh section is
 
04:53:33.750 --> 04:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
that Court oversight piece again this
 
04:53:36.670 --> 04:53:36.680 align:start position:0%
was um edited a bit to sort of lessen
 
04:53:38.948 --> 04:53:38.958 align:start position:0%
the load on the Judiciary as well as the
 
04:53:42.150 --> 04:53:42.160 align:start position:0%
workers attending these hearings so it
 
04:53:43.750 --> 04:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
continues to have a lot of the language
 
04:53:45.670 --> 04:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
around what information the court needs
 
04:53:46.910 --> 04:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
because the Court's been telling us you
 
04:53:49.150 --> 04:53:49.160 align:start position:0%
know we're placing these kids we don't
 
04:53:50.868 --> 04:53:50.878 align:start position:0%
really know where they're going we only
 
04:53:52.990 --> 04:53:53.000 align:start position:0%
have you know that DHHS is telling us
 
04:53:54.708 --> 04:53:54.718 align:start position:0%
that's where the kids should go we'd
 
04:53:56.430 --> 04:53:56.440 align:start position:0%
like a little bit more information why
 
04:53:58.788 --> 04:53:58.798 align:start position:0%
is this child going to that placement
 
04:54:00.628 --> 04:54:00.638 align:start position:0%
what's special about that placement for
 
04:54:02.948 --> 04:54:02.958 align:start position:0%
that child as well as what are the
 
04:54:05.548 --> 04:54:05.558 align:start position:0%
continuing updates on that child we had
 
04:54:07.390 --> 04:54:07.400 align:start position:0%
initially wanted to see more frequent
 
04:54:09.670 --> 04:54:09.680 align:start position:0%
hearings at 30 or 60 days that was going
 
04:54:11.110 --> 04:54:11.120 align:start position:0%
to be a real Bur burden on both the
 
04:54:14.150 --> 04:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
Judiciary and the division so instead we
 
04:54:17.470 --> 04:54:17.480 align:start position:0%
scaled back to one extra visit after the
 
04:54:19.830 --> 04:54:19.840 align:start position:0%
child was placed a more immediate
 
04:54:21.948 --> 04:54:21.958 align:start position:0%
check-in and then to just go back to
 
04:54:23.430 --> 04:54:23.440 align:start position:0%
those regular review hearings which are
 
04:54:25.868 --> 04:54:25.878 align:start position:0%
every 90 days anyway but at those
 
04:54:27.470 --> 04:54:27.480 align:start position:0%
hearings the Court's getting the more
 
04:54:29.350 --> 04:54:29.360 align:start position:0%
information that they've asked for so
 
04:54:31.430 --> 04:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
that they really know what's going on
 
04:54:33.868 --> 04:54:33.878 align:start position:0%
and to make sure meeting this
 
04:54:35.830 --> 04:54:35.840 align:start position:0%
requirement that residential placement
 
04:54:38.030 --> 04:54:38.040 align:start position:0%
should be limited in time and specific
 
04:54:40.150 --> 04:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
in scope for a specific treatment need
 
04:54:41.350 --> 04:54:41.360 align:start position:0%
so now the Court's getting the
 
04:54:43.510 --> 04:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
information that the court needs to make
 
04:54:45.390 --> 04:54:45.400 align:start position:0%
sure that that is in fact happening that
 
04:54:49.230 --> 04:54:49.240 align:start position:0%
there's an end date to this a treatment
 
04:54:52.030 --> 04:54:52.040 align:start position:0%
purpose um finally again I just wanted
 
04:54:54.830 --> 04:54:54.840 align:start position:0%
to bring up um the fiscal piece again I
 
04:54:56.190 --> 04:54:56.200 align:start position:0%
know this committee is the policy
 
04:54:57.948 --> 04:54:57.958 align:start position:0%
committee but you you will be voting on
 
04:55:00.270 --> 04:55:00.280 align:start position:0%
the floor on all of this it is still
 
04:55:02.310 --> 04:55:02.320 align:start position:0%
concerning to us that the three bills
 
04:55:05.110 --> 04:55:05.120 align:start position:0%
that the committee heard today so s459
 
04:55:06.990 --> 04:55:07.000 align:start position:0%
s463 and
 
04:55:09.948 --> 04:55:09.958 align:start position:0%
s417 the way initially written the
 
04:55:14.270 --> 04:55:14.280 align:start position:0%
division was asking for 66 new positions
 
04:55:18.510 --> 04:55:18.520 align:start position:0%
46 new cpsws two new jpos and 18 new
 
04:55:21.310 --> 04:55:21.320 align:start position:0%
attorneys currently there's only 123
 
04:55:23.910 --> 04:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
cpsw Statewide and 35 attorneys so
 
04:55:26.190 --> 04:55:26.200 align:start position:0%
you're looking for an Ask of an increase
 
04:55:27.590 --> 04:55:27.600 align:start position:0%
of 40 to
 
04:55:32.670 --> 04:55:32.680 align:start position:0%
50% of their total Statewide staff in a
 
04:55:35.110 --> 04:55:35.120 align:start position:0%
non-budget year in three bills that
 
04:55:38.390 --> 04:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
really don't require that so
 
04:55:40.430 --> 04:55:40.440 align:start position:0%
individually each bill should not
 
04:55:42.310 --> 04:55:42.320 align:start position:0%
require the number of positions being
 
04:55:45.430 --> 04:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
asked globally though each of these
 
04:55:48.110 --> 04:55:48.120 align:start position:0%
cpsws do all of these things this is
 
04:55:50.830 --> 04:55:50.840 align:start position:0%
extremely duplicative than saying one
 
04:55:54.590 --> 04:55:54.600 align:start position:0%
bill needs 24 new cpsws one needs 14 new
 
04:55:58.270 --> 04:55:58.280 align:start position:0%
cpsws to do a very narrow thing to to
 
04:56:00.510 --> 04:56:00.520 align:start position:0%
increase a visit by one hour to do one
 
04:56:03.150 --> 04:56:03.160 align:start position:0%
extra hearing to read one extra sentence
 
04:56:05.548 --> 04:56:05.558 align:start position:0%
in the foster care Bill of Rights so we
 
04:56:07.110 --> 04:56:07.120 align:start position:0%
would ask you guys to consider I know
 
04:56:08.590 --> 04:56:08.600 align:start position:0%
you're not the finance committee but you
 
04:56:10.030 --> 04:56:10.040 align:start position:0%
are a smart and passionate group of
 
04:56:12.830 --> 04:56:12.840 align:start position:0%
people that care about children and this
 
04:56:15.548 --> 04:56:15.558 align:start position:0%
is really important policy and we would
 
04:56:17.030 --> 04:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
hate to see it not go through because
 
04:56:18.670 --> 04:56:18.680 align:start position:0%
there's just so many positions being
 
04:56:21.190 --> 04:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
asked for in a non-budget year we don't
 
04:56:23.270 --> 04:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
want ccyf to be underst staffed
 
04:56:24.868 --> 04:56:24.878 align:start position:0%
obviously we want them to have a
 
04:56:27.670 --> 04:56:27.680 align:start position:0%
reasonable case load but right now cpsws
 
04:56:29.910 --> 04:56:29.920 align:start position:0%
case loads average about 11 cases which
 
04:56:32.390 --> 04:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
is very low they have bandwidth
 
04:56:34.510 --> 04:56:34.520 align:start position:0%
internally and maybe they do need a few
 
04:56:36.948 --> 04:56:36.958 align:start position:0%
more positions but certainly not 66
 
04:56:39.310 --> 04:56:39.320 align:start position:0%
Statewide certainly not individual
 
04:56:40.948 --> 04:56:40.958 align:start position:0%
people for each
 
04:56:42.948 --> 04:56:42.958 align:start position:0%
task being asked for so we just would
 
04:56:45.868 --> 04:56:45.878 align:start position:0%
ask you to take a look at that because
 
04:56:47.788 --> 04:56:47.798 align:start position:0%
these are really important policies and
 
04:56:49.750 --> 04:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
I know we've talked about this a lot you
 
04:56:52.628 --> 04:56:52.638 align:start position:0%
all know um we did also include the same
 
04:56:54.350 --> 04:56:54.360 align:start position:0%
slide from this morning just with the
 
04:56:56.990 --> 04:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
number of placements and the goal here
 
04:57:00.070 --> 04:57:00.080 align:start position:0%
is to keep kids closer to home in their
 
04:57:02.910 --> 04:57:02.920 align:start position:0%
homes in their communities with their
 
04:57:05.310 --> 04:57:05.320 align:start position:0%
siblings and we know that you all know
 
04:57:07.310 --> 04:57:07.320 align:start position:0%
how important all of that is so we'll
 
04:57:13.548 --> 04:57:13.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:17.310 --> 04:57:17.320 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the 2023 uh
 
04:57:22.628 --> 04:57:22.638 align:start position:0%
2022-2023 Lexus Nexus in chapter
 
04:57:26.750 --> 04:57:26.760 align:start position:0%
169f and it ends with F4 and um then
 
04:57:28.670 --> 04:57:28.680 align:start position:0%
you're picking up here with f8 as if
 
04:57:31.150 --> 04:57:31.160 align:start position:0%
it's new is there a whole bunch of cord
 
04:57:34.030 --> 04:57:34.040 align:start position:0%
placement laws that snuck in in the last
 
04:57:36.110 --> 04:57:36.120 align:start position:0%
year that I'm not up to date on here the
 
04:57:38.070 --> 04:57:38.080 align:start position:0%
numbering has gotten pretty tricky
 
04:57:40.910 --> 04:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
between several of our bills so
 
04:57:45.430 --> 04:57:45.440 align:start position:0%
1573 adds some f sections and this bill
 
04:57:47.670 --> 04:57:47.680 align:start position:0%
adds some f sections so that's something
 
04:57:49.990 --> 04:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
that OLS is going to have to sort out at
 
04:57:53.390 --> 04:57:53.400 align:start position:0%
this juncture we are in there's an F5
 
04:57:56.788 --> 04:57:56.798 align:start position:0%
through n between those two bills and
 
04:57:59.030 --> 04:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
it's gotten a little confusing what's
 
04:58:02.230 --> 04:58:02.240 align:start position:0%
where so if everything passes I trust
 
04:58:04.948 --> 04:58:04.958 align:start position:0%
that OS knows how to count after
 
04:58:07.230 --> 04:58:07.240 align:start position:0%
four and hopefully they'll just end up
 
04:58:09.150 --> 04:58:09.160 align:start position:0%
where they need and the next Lexus Nexus
 
04:58:11.030 --> 04:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
will have figured that out okay good
 
04:58:12.788 --> 04:58:12.798 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions
 
04:58:15.590 --> 04:58:15.600 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford thank thank you
 
04:58:20.150 --> 04:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um I I think this is for the
 
04:58:21.708 --> 04:58:21.718 align:start position:0%
most part very good but I do have a
 
04:58:24.670 --> 04:58:24.680 align:start position:0%
section that concerns me and that's the
 
04:58:27.948 --> 04:58:27.958 align:start position:0%
uh section three where it adds language
 
04:58:31.190 --> 04:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
about um the child going back with the
 
04:58:33.350 --> 04:58:33.360 align:start position:0%
other parent I guess might want to call
 
04:58:37.070 --> 04:58:37.080 align:start position:0%
it and um and then it talks about the
 
04:58:38.110 --> 04:58:38.120 align:start position:0%
court may
 
04:58:40.150 --> 04:58:40.160 align:start position:0%
consider one of one of them like
 
04:58:40.160 --> 04:58:41.470 align:start position:0%
consider one of one of them like
question

04:58:41.470 --> 04:58:41.480 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:58:45.230 --> 04:58:45.240 align:start position:0%
is do we think our courts don't consider
 
04:58:47.948 --> 04:58:47.958 align:start position:0%
enough uh do we have a problem in that
 
04:58:50.708 --> 04:58:50.718 align:start position:0%
respect and the other thing I I can tell
 
04:58:52.628 --> 04:58:52.638 align:start position:0%
you I'm very concerned about the parents
 
04:58:55.510 --> 04:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
existing a historical relationship with
 
04:58:57.788 --> 04:58:57.798 align:start position:0%
that child given that there's
 
04:59:00.628 --> 04:59:00.638 align:start position:0%
constitutional right here to your own
 
04:59:03.190 --> 04:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
child that that would be something to
 
04:59:05.990 --> 04:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
kick them out from being able to be take
 
04:59:08.670 --> 04:59:08.680 align:start position:0%
over the care of their child I guess
 
04:59:10.868 --> 04:59:10.878 align:start position:0%
because that's the best I can read it
 
04:59:13.030 --> 04:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
and the other one is a parent failure to
 
04:59:16.150 --> 04:59:16.160 align:start position:0%
cooperate with the Department's
 
04:59:16.160 --> 04:59:17.788 align:start position:0%
cooperate with the Department's
assessment

04:59:17.788 --> 04:59:17.798 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
04:59:20.708 --> 04:59:20.718 align:start position:0%
um you know when parents get into these
 
04:59:23.548 --> 04:59:23.558 align:start position:0%
situation they get pretty panicky so I
 
04:59:26.788 --> 04:59:26.798 align:start position:0%
I'm not surprised that some would become
 
04:59:30.750 --> 04:59:30.760 align:start position:0%
um um obstinate you might say and be
 
04:59:32.548 --> 04:59:32.558 align:start position:0%
considered uncooperative so those are
 
04:59:35.390 --> 04:59:35.400 align:start position:0%
the two things that really glared at me
 
04:59:37.628 --> 04:59:37.638 align:start position:0%
and I I kind of wish it was a different
 
04:59:40.150 --> 04:59:40.160 align:start position:0%
language quite frankly I appreciate
 
04:59:42.510 --> 04:59:42.520 align:start position:0%
question this is a tricky section um and
 
04:59:44.628 --> 04:59:44.638 align:start position:0%
it does raise a lot of those questions
 
04:59:47.830 --> 04:59:47.840 align:start position:0%
um so your first question currently
 
04:59:50.070 --> 04:59:50.080 align:start position:0%
there's a Supreme Court case called Bill
 
04:59:53.070 --> 04:59:53.080 align:start position:0%
F so this is typically called the bill F
 
04:59:56.708 --> 04:59:56.718 align:start position:0%
section for dcyf attorneys as I was one
 
04:59:59.628 --> 04:59:59.638 align:start position:0%
it the language of that Supreme Court
 
05:00:03.830 --> 05:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
case was extremely limiting and limited
 
05:00:05.510 --> 05:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
what both the division and the court
 
05:00:08.390 --> 05:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
could look at when you're looking at a
 
05:00:10.948 --> 05:00:10.958 align:start position:0%
non-custodial parent in the context and
 
05:00:12.548 --> 05:00:12.558 align:start position:0%
again this is not in a context of a
 
05:00:14.708 --> 05:00:14.718 align:start position:0%
parenting case this is only when the
 
05:00:17.070 --> 05:00:17.080 align:start position:0%
state has taken custody of the child so
 
05:00:19.990 --> 05:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
they have a case against the custodial
 
05:00:22.868 --> 05:00:22.878 align:start position:0%
parent the child has likely been removed
 
05:00:24.750 --> 05:00:24.760 align:start position:0%
they're looking for placement so the
 
05:00:27.150 --> 05:00:27.160 align:start position:0%
non-custodial parent typically that
 
05:00:28.510 --> 05:00:28.520 align:start position:0%
parent's not involved at all which is
 
05:00:30.390 --> 05:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
why there was no filing against them
 
05:00:32.788 --> 05:00:32.798 align:start position:0%
because they just weren't around current
 
05:00:35.470 --> 05:00:35.480 align:start position:0%
law says the division in the court has
 
05:00:37.070 --> 05:00:37.080 align:start position:0%
to find that person has abused or
 
05:00:38.948 --> 05:00:38.958 align:start position:0%
neglected the child which is very
 
05:00:40.708 --> 05:00:40.718 align:start position:0%
difficult if they've not been D at all
 
05:00:43.670 --> 05:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
cuz they've done nothing so that that
 
05:00:47.150 --> 05:00:47.160 align:start position:0%
was a challenge so lots of conversations
 
05:00:49.708 --> 05:00:49.718 align:start position:0%
unfortunately several tragic child
 
05:00:52.150 --> 05:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
murders in situations very similar
 
05:00:53.910 --> 05:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
including Harmony mcgomery but there are
 
05:00:57.150 --> 05:00:57.160 align:start position:0%
others that are not as highly publicized
 
05:00:59.830 --> 05:00:59.840 align:start position:0%
where the state or court is placing a
 
05:01:03.070 --> 05:01:03.080 align:start position:0%
child with a unknown parent essentially
 
05:01:06.070 --> 05:01:06.080 align:start position:0%
and didn't have the ability to really
 
05:01:10.310 --> 05:01:10.320 align:start position:0%
fully offer a case so these new
 
05:01:13.430 --> 05:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
Provisions were sort of gathering all
 
05:01:16.150 --> 05:01:16.160 align:start position:0%
the issues we've seen over cases you've
 
05:01:19.390 --> 05:01:19.400 align:start position:0%
got buou Von you have Elijah Lewis uh
 
05:01:21.390 --> 05:01:21.400 align:start position:0%
trial is coming up so there's been a lot
 
05:01:24.390 --> 05:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
of cases with child homicides that we
 
05:01:26.990 --> 05:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
saw the divisions hands were a little
 
05:01:28.750 --> 05:01:28.760 align:start position:0%
bit tied so these are things the court
 
05:01:32.390 --> 05:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
may consider May being you know
 
05:01:34.628 --> 05:01:34.638 align:start position:0%
provisional trying to list all the
 
05:01:36.270 --> 05:01:36.280 align:start position:0%
things that we've seen being an issue
 
05:01:38.110 --> 05:01:38.120 align:start position:0%
the Massachusetts oier which I think
 
05:01:40.430 --> 05:01:40.440 align:start position:0%
Cassandra mentioned while I was catching
 
05:01:43.910 --> 05:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
my breath over here um the Massachusetts
 
05:01:45.430 --> 05:01:45.440 align:start position:0%
OCA specifically found in the harmony
 
05:01:46.948 --> 05:01:46.958 align:start position:0%
Montgomery case that the court should
 
05:01:48.350 --> 05:01:48.360 align:start position:0%
have considered and we took this
 
05:01:50.390 --> 05:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
language directly from there the unique
 
05:01:52.310 --> 05:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
needs of the child Harmony's unique
 
05:01:54.590 --> 05:01:54.600 align:start position:0%
needs and whether or not the parent in
 
05:01:56.750 --> 05:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
this case Adam McGary is adequately
 
05:01:58.110 --> 05:01:58.120 align:start position:0%
prepared to address those needs because
 
05:02:00.030 --> 05:02:00.040 align:start position:0%
they found that he was not and nobody
 
05:02:01.948 --> 05:02:01.958 align:start position:0%
looked at that and that child is now
 
05:02:05.110 --> 05:02:05.120 align:start position:0%
dead so some of these others the
 
05:02:07.390 --> 05:02:07.400 align:start position:0%
existing relationship and again just may
 
05:02:10.110 --> 05:02:10.120 align:start position:0%
consider whether the the parent has uh
 
05:02:12.190 --> 05:02:12.200 align:start position:0%
mental health or substance use issues
 
05:02:13.628 --> 05:02:13.638 align:start position:0%
and this isn't to permanently keep a
 
05:02:15.270 --> 05:02:15.280 align:start position:0%
child away from a parent this is to
 
05:02:17.270 --> 05:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
allow the division to offer services to
 
05:02:19.750 --> 05:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
that parent to be able to place but it
 
05:02:21.270 --> 05:02:21.280 align:start position:0%
must be considered before you put the
 
05:02:23.190 --> 05:02:23.200 align:start position:0%
child there and potentially in
 
05:02:27.350 --> 05:02:27.360 align:start position:0%
danger uh followup thank you Mr chair
 
05:02:30.708 --> 05:02:30.718 align:start position:0%
thank you um all right you use the word
 
05:02:33.190 --> 05:02:33.200 align:start position:0%
noncustodial in New Hampshire we rarely
 
05:02:34.830 --> 05:02:34.840 align:start position:0%
I believe we really do non-custodial
 
05:02:37.150 --> 05:02:37.160 align:start position:0%
anymore we recognize that both parents
 
05:02:38.788 --> 05:02:38.798 align:start position:0%
have uh parental rights and
 
05:02:38.798 --> 05:02:40.430 align:start position:0%
have uh parental rights and
responsibilities

05:02:40.430 --> 05:02:40.440 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
 
05:02:40.440 --> 05:02:41.350 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
and

05:02:41.350 --> 05:02:41.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:02:43.788 --> 05:02:43.798 align:start position:0%
so how does one of those parents fit
 
05:02:46.390 --> 05:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
into this they're not a non-custodial
 
05:02:49.590 --> 05:02:49.600 align:start position:0%
they have some degree of custodial right
 
05:02:51.590 --> 05:02:51.600 align:start position:0%
in a dcyf case so again we're talking
 
05:02:53.670 --> 05:02:53.680 align:start position:0%
about a case where DCF so the state
 
05:02:55.190 --> 05:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
already has custody which means the
 
05:02:57.230 --> 05:02:57.240 align:start position:0%
state has liability for where the state
 
05:03:01.750 --> 05:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
places that child in a dcyf case the
 
05:03:05.070 --> 05:03:05.080 align:start position:0%
adults who have the child when the abuse
 
05:03:07.628 --> 05:03:07.638 align:start position:0%
occurs which can include a stepparent so
 
05:03:09.150 --> 05:03:09.160 align:start position:0%
like the home they're looking at the
 
05:03:11.070 --> 05:03:11.080 align:start position:0%
home and the adult in the home the
 
05:03:13.350 --> 05:03:13.360 align:start position:0%
filing is against that that home where
 
05:03:16.548 --> 05:03:16.558 align:start position:0%
the abuse happened there is a and the
 
05:03:19.070 --> 05:03:19.080 align:start position:0%
the language on the fors is different
 
05:03:21.708 --> 05:03:21.718 align:start position:0%
and frankly not consistent there's a
 
05:03:24.470 --> 05:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
parent who's not in the home and maybe
 
05:03:27.430 --> 05:03:27.440 align:start position:0%
not accused non-custodial was the
 
05:03:28.990 --> 05:03:29.000 align:start position:0%
easiest way to write that I'm happy if
 
05:03:30.548 --> 05:03:30.558 align:start position:0%
you we want to try and find other
 
05:03:31.910 --> 05:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
language but that's essentially what
 
05:03:34.910 --> 05:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
that means is that parent was not in the
 
05:03:37.548 --> 05:03:37.558 align:start position:0%
household at the time the abuse occurred
 
05:03:40.230 --> 05:03:40.240 align:start position:0%
and so that parent is not being filed
 
05:03:42.868 --> 05:03:42.878 align:start position:0%
against for that abuse because they were
 
05:03:44.670 --> 05:03:44.680 align:start position:0%
removed from that abuse they could be
 
05:03:46.070 --> 05:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
Merchant Marines it could be working on
 
05:03:50.030 --> 05:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
the power lines likely they could be
 
05:03:51.948 --> 05:03:51.958 align:start position:0%
that is not often what I have seen as a
 
05:03:53.670 --> 05:03:53.680 align:start position:0%
dcyf attorney they're typically just
 
05:03:55.030 --> 05:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
simply not involved in their child's
 
05:03:56.150 --> 05:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
life they could be living down the
 
05:03:57.510 --> 05:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
street they could be living on the other
 
05:03:58.948 --> 05:03:58.958 align:start position:0%
side of the country they just they
 
05:04:00.350 --> 05:04:00.360 align:start position:0%
didn't have anything to do with that
 
05:04:01.830 --> 05:04:01.840 align:start position:0%
child so therefore they had nothing to
 
05:04:04.990 --> 05:04:05.000 align:start position:0%
do with that abuse either I I I agree
 
05:04:07.150 --> 05:04:07.160 align:start position:0%
with that I just don't believe I I want
 
05:04:09.230 --> 05:04:09.240 align:start position:0%
to be careful that we're not wrapping
 
05:04:10.708 --> 05:04:10.718 align:start position:0%
people in with this there shouldn't be
 
05:04:12.868 --> 05:04:12.878 align:start position:0%
wrapped into it so like I say there's
 
05:04:14.270 --> 05:04:14.280 align:start position:0%
Merchant Marines I have a son-in-laws on
 
05:04:16.788 --> 05:04:16.798 align:start position:0%
the Coast Guard 100% the the division
 
05:04:18.948 --> 05:04:18.958 align:start position:0%
will place the child with that parent if
 
05:04:20.948 --> 05:04:20.958 align:start position:0%
they don't have an issue if that parent
 
05:04:23.310 --> 05:04:23.320 align:start position:0%
seems adequate this is in cases where
 
05:04:25.708 --> 05:04:25.718 align:start position:0%
the division has concerns about that
 
05:04:28.350 --> 05:04:28.360 align:start position:0%
parent and needs to investigate it just
 
05:04:29.708 --> 05:04:29.718 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem like it reads that way to
 
05:04:32.948 --> 05:04:32.958 align:start position:0%
me anyway that this section is a
 
05:04:35.590 --> 05:04:35.600 align:start position:0%
specific section this bill F section and
 
05:04:38.030 --> 05:04:38.040 align:start position:0%
it's only when the division has not
 
05:04:40.150 --> 05:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
placed with that other parent there are
 
05:04:42.070 --> 05:04:42.080 align:start position:0%
cases where they remove from one parent
 
05:04:43.830 --> 05:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason and immediately
 
05:04:45.230 --> 05:04:45.240 align:start position:0%
place with the other parent and
 
05:04:47.470 --> 05:04:47.480 align:start position:0%
everything's fine that parent has the
 
05:04:50.190 --> 05:04:50.200 align:start position:0%
kid okay it's cases when the division
 
05:04:53.070 --> 05:04:53.080 align:start position:0%
has concerns about that other parent
 
05:04:55.150 --> 05:04:55.160 align:start position:0%
that parent can file a motion for a
 
05:04:57.548 --> 05:04:57.558 align:start position:0%
fitness hearing is what it's called
 
05:05:00.110 --> 05:05:00.120 align:start position:0%
saying I want my kid right
 
05:05:03.150 --> 05:05:03.160 align:start position:0%
now we need to determine Fitness and
 
05:05:04.548 --> 05:05:04.558 align:start position:0%
that's where the problem lies the
 
05:05:07.310 --> 05:05:07.320 align:start position:0%
current law the division in the court
 
05:05:10.310 --> 05:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
has very little information to go on
 
05:05:12.470 --> 05:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
yet it's the state's liability because
 
05:05:14.470 --> 05:05:14.480 align:start position:0%
the state's placing with that person so
 
05:05:16.350 --> 05:05:16.360 align:start position:0%
it's a very narrow and unique
 
05:05:18.590 --> 05:05:18.600 align:start position:0%
circumstance when this happens it's it's
 
05:05:21.750 --> 05:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
not very common and it is important to
 
05:05:23.270 --> 05:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
note that the language here is that the
 
05:05:25.350 --> 05:05:25.360 align:start position:0%
court may consider it's allowing the
 
05:05:27.910 --> 05:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
court to consider these additional
 
05:05:30.948 --> 05:05:30.958 align:start position:0%
factors here which they currently cannot
 
05:05:33.190 --> 05:05:33.200 align:start position:0%
but it's not a shall intentionally
 
05:05:35.350 --> 05:05:35.360 align:start position:0%
because if that parent presents
 
05:05:36.990 --> 05:05:37.000 align:start position:0%
themselves to the court with a
 
05:05:38.270 --> 05:05:38.280 align:start position:0%
long-standing relationship with their
 
05:05:40.788 --> 05:05:40.798 align:start position:0%
child showing proof of being overseas or
 
05:05:42.868 --> 05:05:42.878 align:start position:0%
something of that sort the court may not
 
05:05:44.310 --> 05:05:44.320 align:start position:0%
have to consider any of this there is
 
05:05:45.590 --> 05:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
enough right there for them to go
 
05:05:47.510 --> 05:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
through with it so it's not a shall
 
05:05:49.470 --> 05:05:49.480 align:start position:0%
because not every parent is going to
 
05:05:52.548 --> 05:05:52.558 align:start position:0%
need this level of
 
05:05:54.510 --> 05:05:54.520 align:start position:0%
assessment okay I didn't know the court
 
05:05:57.070 --> 05:05:57.080 align:start position:0%
couldn't look at those things under the
 
05:05:59.830 --> 05:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
current bill F case that it's extremely
 
05:06:01.670 --> 05:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
narrow and is challenging and that is an
 
05:06:03.948 --> 05:06:03.958 align:start position:0%
issue that's been presented to us from
 
05:06:07.190 --> 05:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
both the field and the court and like I
 
05:06:09.070 --> 05:06:09.080 align:start position:0%
said mentioned in the harmony Montgomery
 
05:06:11.750 --> 05:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
case specific specifically of we need to
 
05:06:14.708 --> 05:06:14.718 align:start position:0%
allow the court the ability to fully
 
05:06:17.190 --> 05:06:17.200 align:start position:0%
investigate and make sure that the state
 
05:06:19.948 --> 05:06:19.958 align:start position:0%
handing this child over to this parent
 
05:06:22.230 --> 05:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
who wasn't involved is safe because
 
05:06:24.548 --> 05:06:24.558 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we have a number of
 
05:06:26.230 --> 05:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
children no longer with us because it
 
05:06:29.310 --> 05:06:29.320 align:start position:0%
wasn't safe but their the current bill f
 
05:06:32.150 --> 05:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
is is very narrow well thank you thank
 
05:06:34.470 --> 05:06:34.480 align:start position:0%
you thank you for the
 
05:06:36.590 --> 05:06:36.600 align:start position:0%
latitude representative Raymond I think
 
05:06:39.708 --> 05:06:39.718 align:start position:0%
you had your hand up I I did and I my my
 
05:06:41.590 --> 05:06:41.600 align:start position:0%
first thought was thank you Mr chairman
 
05:06:43.150 --> 05:06:43.160 align:start position:0%
my first thought was following up on
 
05:06:45.070 --> 05:06:45.080 align:start position:0%
representative bigf for's question about
 
05:06:47.948 --> 05:06:47.958 align:start position:0%
what questions are is DCF and the
 
05:06:50.670 --> 05:06:50.680 align:start position:0%
Court's asking of those absent parents
 
05:06:52.990 --> 05:06:53.000 align:start position:0%
before they hand over a child like in
 
05:06:55.470 --> 05:06:55.480 align:start position:0%
the case of Harmony Montgomery or some
 
05:06:57.070 --> 05:06:57.080 align:start position:0%
of these other children who have been
 
05:07:00.190 --> 05:07:00.200 align:start position:0%
harmed what type of what's the current
 
05:07:02.948 --> 05:07:02.958 align:start position:0%
practice for when a child is removed
 
05:07:04.750 --> 05:07:04.760 align:start position:0%
from say the mother because the mother
 
05:07:08.190 --> 05:07:08.200 align:start position:0%
was abusive and dad hasn't been around
 
05:07:10.670 --> 05:07:10.680 align:start position:0%
what is DCF doing now to make sure that
 
05:07:12.350 --> 05:07:12.360 align:start position:0%
dad doesn't have an extreme drinking
 
05:07:14.390 --> 05:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
problem or isn't you know you know
 
05:07:18.708 --> 05:07:18.718 align:start position:0%
selling guns legally or DCF has a a
 
05:07:21.430 --> 05:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
limited ability to investigate a parent
 
05:07:24.670 --> 05:07:24.680 align:start position:0%
who is not currently accused and that's
 
05:07:27.628 --> 05:07:27.638 align:start position:0%
the kind of the rub it goes both ways of
 
05:07:28.990 --> 05:07:29.000 align:start position:0%
if you have a parent that's really been
 
05:07:31.030 --> 05:07:31.040 align:start position:0%
completely absent you know essentially
 
05:07:32.708 --> 05:07:32.718 align:start position:0%
nothing about that person they've not
 
05:07:32.718 --> 05:07:33.430 align:start position:0%
nothing about that person they've not
been

05:07:33.430 --> 05:07:33.440 align:start position:0%
been
 
05:07:37.350 --> 05:07:37.360 align:start position:0%
involved um and like I said the current
 
05:07:40.070 --> 05:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
bill F language is essentially
 
05:07:41.548 --> 05:07:41.558 align:start position:0%
the division has to prove that that
 
05:07:43.548 --> 05:07:43.558 align:start position:0%
person has abused or neglected the child
 
05:07:45.190 --> 05:07:45.200 align:start position:0%
which if you could prove that they'd
 
05:07:46.510 --> 05:07:46.520 align:start position:0%
abused or neglected the child you would
 
05:07:48.230 --> 05:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
have filed a petition to begin with
 
05:07:50.270 --> 05:07:50.280 align:start position:0%
right it's because this person has been
 
05:07:52.628 --> 05:07:52.638 align:start position:0%
almost completely absent there's not a
 
05:07:55.948 --> 05:07:55.958 align:start position:0%
lot known they don't necessarily have to
 
05:07:58.070 --> 05:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
cooperate that you're stuck in this
 
05:08:01.110 --> 05:08:01.120 align:start position:0%
position of I can't find this person not
 
05:08:03.270 --> 05:08:03.280 align:start position:0%
fit because the standard's so high yet
 
05:08:05.548 --> 05:08:05.558 align:start position:0%
I'm handing this child over to someone
 
05:08:07.590 --> 05:08:07.600 align:start position:0%
who may be completely
 
05:08:10.670 --> 05:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
unprepared to parent this child and this
 
05:08:14.470 --> 05:08:14.480 align:start position:0%
child could be in grave danger so to to
 
05:08:16.750 --> 05:08:16.760 align:start position:0%
clarify so this language would then
 
05:08:19.110 --> 05:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
allow DCF and the court to ask those
 
05:08:21.670 --> 05:08:21.680 align:start position:0%
questions and to consider it in that
 
05:08:23.948 --> 05:08:23.958 align:start position:0%
Fitness hearing and have that be what
 
05:08:26.110 --> 05:08:26.120 align:start position:0%
they're weighing not this standard of
 
05:08:27.708 --> 05:08:27.718 align:start position:0%
have they abused or neglected because of
 
05:08:28.868 --> 05:08:28.878 align:start position:0%
course they haven't they haven't been
 
05:08:31.270 --> 05:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
around so it would change the standard
 
05:08:33.070 --> 05:08:33.080 align:start position:0%
of things that actually impact that
 
05:08:36.590 --> 05:08:36.600 align:start position:0%
child well-being to to determine on that
 
05:08:39.110 --> 05:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
and again this person still has not been
 
05:08:40.788 --> 05:08:40.798 align:start position:0%
accused accused of abuse or neglect but
 
05:08:42.670 --> 05:08:42.680 align:start position:0%
then now the division knows enough to
 
05:08:44.390 --> 05:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
offer services and be able to
 
05:08:45.990 --> 05:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
potentially put services in place and
 
05:08:48.230 --> 05:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
get that child with that parent but in a
 
05:08:52.030 --> 05:08:52.040 align:start position:0%
safe way okay can I ask an unrelated
 
05:08:54.628 --> 05:08:54.638 align:start position:0%
question yeah follow up with an
 
05:08:57.708 --> 05:08:57.718 align:start position:0%
unrelated question thank you Mr chairman
 
05:09:01.430 --> 05:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
um on a a a second part of the another
 
05:09:03.548 --> 05:09:03.558 align:start position:0%
part of the the bill um where it's
 
05:09:05.310 --> 05:09:05.320 align:start position:0%
talking about the preference of out of
 
05:09:07.910 --> 05:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
home placement um and talking about
 
05:09:10.910 --> 05:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
trying to avoid um residential placement
 
05:09:13.948 --> 05:09:13.958 align:start position:0%
which I totally agree with um what
 
05:09:16.628 --> 05:09:16.638 align:start position:0%
happens in the circumstances where there
 
05:09:18.708 --> 05:09:18.718 align:start position:0%
isn't a foster home available because I
 
05:09:21.350 --> 05:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
think that historically we've had kids
 
05:09:24.030 --> 05:09:24.040 align:start position:0%
going into Residential Care local
 
05:09:25.948 --> 05:09:25.958 align:start position:0%
locally you know within the state
 
05:09:27.150 --> 05:09:27.160 align:start position:0%
because they weren't able to find a
 
05:09:29.110 --> 05:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
foster home that could take all of the
 
05:09:31.110 --> 05:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
siblings or even that couldn't find a
 
05:09:34.230 --> 05:09:34.240 align:start position:0%
foster home for that age group like what
 
05:09:35.990 --> 05:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
does this bill address that circumstance
 
05:09:37.750 --> 05:09:37.760 align:start position:0%
and then kind of what
 
05:09:40.830 --> 05:09:40.840 align:start position:0%
happens um so not directly it it is an
 
05:09:43.628 --> 05:09:43.638 align:start position:0%
an issue that we see and and part of the
 
05:09:45.110 --> 05:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
the critical piece of this bill is
 
05:09:46.430 --> 05:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
making sure that that's not happening to
 
05:09:47.628 --> 05:09:47.638 align:start position:0%
children that they're just ending up
 
05:09:49.788 --> 05:09:49.798 align:start position:0%
stuck in residential care when it's not
 
05:09:51.548 --> 05:09:51.558 align:start position:0%
necessary because what we see happens
 
05:09:53.230 --> 05:09:53.240 align:start position:0%
now is that there are children filling
 
05:09:55.350 --> 05:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
beds that other children need and so
 
05:09:56.310 --> 05:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
those children can't get in there
 
05:09:57.270 --> 05:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
because we haven't moved the other ones
 
05:09:59.868 --> 05:09:59.878 align:start position:0%
out um but really the focus here is
 
05:10:02.948 --> 05:10:02.958 align:start position:0%
about that the kin fictive kin or kin
 
05:10:05.788 --> 05:10:05.798 align:start position:0%
Foster family and the division has done
 
05:10:08.470 --> 05:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
some work by by um working with a new
 
05:10:10.070 --> 05:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
program now they've brought into the
 
05:10:13.190 --> 05:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
state to do a very thorough kin search
 
05:10:15.590 --> 05:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
for this child so they the case workers
 
05:10:17.750 --> 05:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
were doing an initial search sending out
 
05:10:19.670 --> 05:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
some letters to family members and that
 
05:10:21.350 --> 05:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
was really all they had the capacity to
 
05:10:24.510 --> 05:10:24.520 align:start position:0%
do now that they have um a second chance
 
05:10:27.310 --> 05:10:27.320 align:start position:0%
they're it's it is um contracted out and
 
05:10:29.670 --> 05:10:29.680 align:start position:0%
and this person's sole role is reaching
 
05:10:31.510 --> 05:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
out to everybody and anybody checking
 
05:10:33.150 --> 05:10:33.160 align:start position:0%
back with a child checking back with the
 
05:10:35.270 --> 05:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
parent do you know anybody else do you
 
05:10:37.070 --> 05:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
have a coach is there a teacher is there
 
05:10:39.310 --> 05:10:39.320 align:start position:0%
somebody else you're connected to and
 
05:10:41.548 --> 05:10:41.558 align:start position:0%
because that's their sole role they are
 
05:10:44.150 --> 05:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
able to spend the time necessary to
 
05:10:47.270 --> 05:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
truly do a a thorough search where the
 
05:10:50.030 --> 05:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
social workers have so much that they're
 
05:10:52.708 --> 05:10:52.718 align:start position:0%
managing that they can't put as much
 
05:10:55.270 --> 05:10:55.280 align:start position:0%
energy into a kin search as as um what
 
05:10:58.390 --> 05:10:58.400 align:start position:0%
this program can do and so this would
 
05:11:00.510 --> 05:11:00.520 align:start position:0%
tie into that really the move would be
 
05:11:02.030 --> 05:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
and we know the research tells us
 
05:11:03.548 --> 05:11:03.558 align:start position:0%
children have the best outcomes when
 
05:11:05.670 --> 05:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
they're in a familiar place um
 
05:11:07.230 --> 05:11:07.240 align:start position:0%
particularly with family are the best
 
05:11:09.270 --> 05:11:09.280 align:start position:0%
outcomes but even if it's not family
 
05:11:10.830 --> 05:11:10.840 align:start position:0%
somebody else who's invested in them
 
05:11:13.470 --> 05:11:13.480 align:start position:0%
knows them and plans to assist in that
 
05:11:15.948 --> 05:11:15.958 align:start position:0%
reunification when that child goes home
 
05:11:17.310 --> 05:11:17.320 align:start position:0%
that leads to better outcomes for our
 
05:11:20.070 --> 05:11:20.080 align:start position:0%
children and so if D if dcyf is doing
 
05:11:21.830 --> 05:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
that work by bringing the program here
 
05:11:23.390 --> 05:11:23.400 align:start position:0%
which they're they've already
 
05:11:27.070 --> 05:11:27.080 align:start position:0%
implemented and we have this this
 
05:11:29.990 --> 05:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
preference of placement in place with
 
05:11:32.110 --> 05:11:32.120 align:start position:0%
kin as that
 
05:11:34.788 --> 05:11:34.798 align:start position:0%
primary the hope is is that that will
 
05:11:36.470 --> 05:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
they'll be begin to be fed into that
 
05:11:37.830 --> 05:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
system at a higher rate than they are
 
05:11:41.430 --> 05:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
and we've seen it and DHHS numbers the
 
05:11:43.190 --> 05:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
the kin placements have been the ones
 
05:11:45.030 --> 05:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
that are increasing the most although
 
05:11:46.708 --> 05:11:46.718 align:start position:0%
the residential placements are staying
 
05:11:50.430 --> 05:11:50.440 align:start position:0%
about the same about that just under 30%
 
05:11:52.708 --> 05:11:52.718 align:start position:0%
um May fluctuate between about 25 and
 
05:11:55.708 --> 05:11:55.718 align:start position:0%
30% but the kin placements are going up
 
05:11:57.670 --> 05:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
so it's showing us that it's working and
 
05:11:59.110 --> 05:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
so that's why we're looking at now is
 
05:12:00.830 --> 05:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
the prime time to have this because
 
05:12:02.788 --> 05:12:02.798 align:start position:0%
there are services in place to back that
 
05:12:05.430 --> 05:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
up and I would add to that uh one of the
 
05:12:07.230 --> 05:12:07.240 align:start position:0%
pieces of hb1
 
05:12:10.750 --> 05:12:10.760 align:start position:0%
1573 um maybe will get reinstated or not
 
05:12:13.670 --> 05:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
was an reallocation of funds to
 
05:12:16.270 --> 05:12:16.280 align:start position:0%
recapture funds saved on placing
 
05:12:17.830 --> 05:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
children at these very expensive
 
05:12:20.628 --> 05:12:20.638 align:start position:0%
residential far out of state um to
 
05:12:22.708 --> 05:12:22.718 align:start position:0%
reinvest in the Community Resources
 
05:12:24.948 --> 05:12:24.958 align:start position:0%
because both families you know
 
05:12:27.670 --> 05:12:27.680 align:start position:0%
biological families relative placements
 
05:12:30.230 --> 05:12:30.240 align:start position:0%
and kin infective kin placements all
 
05:12:32.030 --> 05:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
need those Community Resources to be
 
05:12:34.788 --> 05:12:34.798 align:start position:0%
bulked up so it is the job of the
 
05:12:36.390 --> 05:12:36.400 align:start position:0%
division to find an appropriate
 
05:12:38.150 --> 05:12:38.160 align:start position:0%
placement not just a convenient
 
05:12:40.430 --> 05:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
placement and as we spoke about this
 
05:12:42.070 --> 05:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
morning children that get placed in
 
05:12:44.310 --> 05:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
residential placement if there's no imp
 
05:12:48.310 --> 05:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
like real dis like if there's no push to
 
05:12:50.948 --> 05:12:50.958 align:start position:0%
place with a family or a family like
 
05:12:52.948 --> 05:12:52.958 align:start position:0%
setting they just leave them there
 
05:12:55.470 --> 05:12:55.480 align:start position:0%
because now they're at least in a place
 
05:12:59.310 --> 05:12:59.320 align:start position:0%
um it is also federal law that the lack
 
05:13:02.310 --> 05:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
of foster homes and resources is not a
 
05:13:04.070 --> 05:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
reason to place a child in a more
 
05:13:05.350 --> 05:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
restrictive setting that's not
 
05:13:07.190 --> 05:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate for that child so that is
 
05:13:08.670 --> 05:13:08.680 align:start position:0%
also part of federal law which the
 
05:13:11.708 --> 05:13:11.718 align:start position:0%
division is is required to
 
05:13:22.350 --> 05:13:22.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:25.548 --> 05:13:25.558 align:start position:0%
Panic thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
05:13:27.548 --> 05:13:27.558 align:start position:0%
for the reminder as well thank you for
 
05:13:28.670 --> 05:13:28.680 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
05:13:32.190 --> 05:13:32.200 align:start position:0%
question um I've got a lot of inquiries
 
05:13:32.200 --> 05:13:33.230 align:start position:0%
question um I've got a lot of inquiries
from

05:13:33.230 --> 05:13:33.240 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:13:35.628 --> 05:13:35.638 align:start position:0%
constituents and other
 
05:13:39.990 --> 05:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
legislators and um in section A a on
 
05:13:40.000 --> 05:13:41.628 align:start position:0%
legislators and um in section A a on
page

05:13:41.628 --> 05:13:41.638 align:start position:0%
page
 
05:13:45.190 --> 05:13:45.200 align:start position:0%
two line three
 
05:13:48.868 --> 05:13:48.878 align:start position:0%
M the unique needs of the child and
 
05:13:51.948 --> 05:13:51.958 align:start position:0%
whether or not the parent is
 
05:13:54.750 --> 05:13:54.760 align:start position:0%
adequately prepared to address those
 
05:13:58.868 --> 05:13:58.878 align:start position:0%
needs could that line just be removed
 
05:14:02.110 --> 05:14:02.120 align:start position:0%
because it's just so vague with the word
 
05:14:06.948 --> 05:14:06.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:10.030 --> 05:14:10.040 align:start position:0%
um what is the definition of unique what
 
05:14:12.910 --> 05:14:12.920 align:start position:0%
do you mean by unique so this is the
 
05:14:15.070 --> 05:14:15.080 align:start position:0%
section where attorney massio was was
 
05:14:18.030 --> 05:14:18.040 align:start position:0%
pointing to um the very clear
 
05:14:20.150 --> 05:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
recommendations from the Massachusetts
 
05:14:21.830 --> 05:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
Office of the child advocate report in
 
05:14:24.030 --> 05:14:24.040 align:start position:0%
response to Harmony Montgomery and they
 
05:14:26.070 --> 05:14:26.080 align:start position:0%
highlighted with those specific terms
 
05:14:29.590 --> 05:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
that um not only in the state of
 
05:14:32.190 --> 05:14:32.200 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts but also elsewhere um that
 
05:14:33.948 --> 05:14:33.958 align:start position:0%
the unique needs of the child shall
 
05:14:36.190 --> 05:14:36.200 align:start position:0%
always be considered by the court was
 
05:14:38.548 --> 05:14:38.558 align:start position:0%
their recommendation and so there
 
05:14:40.910 --> 05:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
there's no definition for unique needs
 
05:14:42.390 --> 05:14:42.400 align:start position:0%
but that is the the language that has
 
05:14:44.990 --> 05:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
been captured um and in thinking about
 
05:14:47.868 --> 05:14:47.878 align:start position:0%
Harmony's case specifically there were
 
05:14:50.788 --> 05:14:50.798 align:start position:0%
medical needs behavioral needs
 
05:14:54.868 --> 05:14:54.878 align:start position:0%
that were not of a typical child her age
 
05:14:59.230 --> 05:14:59.240 align:start position:0%
and so given that parents need more
 
05:15:02.150 --> 05:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
experience or support to be able to
 
05:15:03.390 --> 05:15:03.400 align:start position:0%
manage that particularly if they're
 
05:15:04.830 --> 05:15:04.840 align:start position:0%
parenting that for the very first time
 
05:15:06.750 --> 05:15:06.760 align:start position:0%
and they don't know that child very well
 
05:15:07.948 --> 05:15:07.958 align:start position:0%
and so that's what that section is
 
05:15:09.510 --> 05:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
speaking to is the import importance of
 
05:15:12.350 --> 05:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
taking all of those factors into account
 
05:15:15.230 --> 05:15:15.240 align:start position:0%
and as um as Lisa had mentioned here
 
05:15:18.190 --> 05:15:18.200 align:start position:0%
it's also important that this section it
 
05:15:20.910 --> 05:15:20.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that that parent will never
 
05:15:22.670 --> 05:15:22.680 align:start position:0%
be able to have that child but it may
 
05:15:24.708 --> 05:15:24.718 align:start position:0%
mean that they meet everything else but
 
05:15:26.430 --> 05:15:26.440 align:start position:0%
understanding their child's unique needs
 
05:15:27.830 --> 05:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
and maybe there's some work to be done
 
05:15:29.510 --> 05:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
with a service provider that can that
 
05:15:32.070 --> 05:15:32.080 align:start position:0%
can be put in place to support them in
 
05:15:34.150 --> 05:15:34.160 align:start position:0%
understanding that and how to meet them
 
05:15:36.350 --> 05:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
making sure that they are effectively
 
05:15:38.470 --> 05:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
doing so before they close out and then
 
05:15:40.230 --> 05:15:40.240 align:start position:0%
that parent could be the primary
 
05:15:42.670 --> 05:15:42.680 align:start position:0%
caretaker of that child but do they have
 
05:15:44.788 --> 05:15:44.798 align:start position:0%
the ability to make sure that their
 
05:15:47.070 --> 05:15:47.080 align:start position:0%
child is safe and for some children safe
 
05:15:49.750 --> 05:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
means Beyond just physical safety it may
 
05:15:52.070 --> 05:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
mean a child with mental health issues
 
05:15:55.310 --> 05:15:55.320 align:start position:0%
who is suicidal is a parent equipped to
 
05:15:57.070 --> 05:15:57.080 align:start position:0%
manage that suicidal ideation on a
 
05:15:58.948 --> 05:15:58.958 align:start position:0%
regular basis or do they need some time
 
05:16:01.430 --> 05:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
to be educated to understand that and
 
05:16:03.830 --> 05:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
then they can take on caring for that
 
05:16:06.830 --> 05:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
child and as we've seen the state is
 
05:16:08.430 --> 05:16:08.440 align:start position:0%
open to liability there have been
 
05:16:11.150 --> 05:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
multiple lawsuits over these kind of
 
05:16:14.910 --> 05:16:14.920 align:start position:0%
issues because it is the state placing
 
05:16:17.150 --> 05:16:17.160 align:start position:0%
it's not like you know a parenting case
 
05:16:18.990 --> 05:16:19.000 align:start position:0%
where it's just between two parents this
 
05:16:20.708 --> 05:16:20.718 align:start position:0%
is where the state actually has custody
 
05:16:23.270 --> 05:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
of a child and the state becomes liable
 
05:16:25.270 --> 05:16:25.280 align:start position:0%
then for those placement choices and
 
05:16:28.030 --> 05:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the state is getting sued
 
05:16:30.430 --> 05:16:30.440 align:start position:0%
in several cases
 
05:16:30.440 --> 05:16:32.150 align:start position:0%
in several cases
well

05:16:32.150 --> 05:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:16:34.548 --> 05:16:34.558 align:start position:0%
um all right
 
05:16:39.230 --> 05:16:39.240 align:start position:0%
so if you feel that the parent is unable
 
05:16:40.830 --> 05:16:40.840 align:start position:0%
to handle the
 
05:16:43.390 --> 05:16:43.400 align:start position:0%
unique needs of the
 
05:16:47.708 --> 05:16:47.718 align:start position:0%
child and if we skip over to
 
05:16:51.548 --> 05:16:51.558 align:start position:0%
G and your agency goes in there and says
 
05:16:53.310 --> 05:16:53.320 align:start position:0%
you know we've got to take your child
 
05:16:57.628 --> 05:16:57.638 align:start position:0%
away in place the child in another
 
05:16:59.990 --> 05:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
environment and the
 
05:17:02.070 --> 05:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
parent is
 
05:17:04.990 --> 05:17:05.000 align:start position:0%
resisting that idea and I'm going to use
 
05:17:10.628 --> 05:17:10.638 align:start position:0%
an example um maybe a child wants to
 
05:17:14.150 --> 05:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
transition and is under the age of 18
 
05:17:17.350 --> 05:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
years old and has had this idea for
 
05:17:20.670 --> 05:17:20.680 align:start position:0%
maybe 3 months and the parent doesn't
 
05:17:24.470 --> 05:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
think that this is this may just be a
 
05:17:26.990 --> 05:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
phase all right maybe just going through
 
05:17:29.910 --> 05:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
a tomboy phase or whatever and doesn't
 
05:17:32.470 --> 05:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
want to make a you know a quick decision
 
05:17:35.590 --> 05:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
on something like that the way this is
 
05:17:39.750 --> 05:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
written if a parent resists that
 
05:17:43.070 --> 05:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
it says that this could be this this
 
05:17:43.080 --> 05:17:44.628 align:start position:0%
it says that this could be this this
assessment

05:17:44.628 --> 05:17:44.638 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
05:17:47.110 --> 05:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
um the Department's assessment to
 
05:17:49.708 --> 05:17:49.718 align:start position:0%
provide any records necessary such a
 
05:17:51.750 --> 05:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
determination shall be weighed as a
 
05:17:55.590 --> 05:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
factor in the fitness of that parent
 
05:17:57.190 --> 05:17:57.200 align:start position:0%
that's alarming to
 
05:17:59.830 --> 05:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
me I appreciate that question I really
 
05:18:02.390 --> 05:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
appreciate the clarification so this
 
05:18:04.470 --> 05:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
would not apply to that situation at all
 
05:18:06.708 --> 05:18:06.718 align:start position:0%
but if you remove if you could change
 
05:18:10.310 --> 05:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
but you're I believe what you're saying
 
05:18:14.788 --> 05:18:14.798 align:start position:0%
so but I have to go to my constituents
 
05:18:17.110 --> 05:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
and say don't worry about it and I know
 
05:18:19.670 --> 05:18:19.680 align:start position:0%
your intentions are good God bless you
 
05:18:22.350 --> 05:18:22.360 align:start position:0%
for the work that you do it's not an
 
05:18:26.788 --> 05:18:26.798 align:start position:0%
easy job um is there a way to reward
 
05:18:29.788 --> 05:18:29.798 align:start position:0%
this that it would make everybody else
 
05:18:33.670 --> 05:18:33.680 align:start position:0%
feel more comfortable with it
 
05:18:36.110 --> 05:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
so I would love to give you a simple
 
05:18:37.910 --> 05:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
answer but the answer is that the
 
05:18:40.830 --> 05:18:40.840 align:start position:0%
section of the law that this is in does
 
05:18:45.150 --> 05:18:45.160 align:start position:0%
not apply to that situation 169 C is
 
05:18:47.910 --> 05:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
only cases where the division is
 
05:18:50.510 --> 05:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
involved and this particular section
 
05:18:54.350 --> 05:18:54.360 align:start position:0%
only applies if the division so OCA is
 
05:18:56.628 --> 05:18:56.638 align:start position:0%
doesn't provide Direct Services that's
 
05:19:01.270 --> 05:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
DCF if DCF has already removed the child
 
05:19:04.510 --> 05:19:04.520 align:start position:0%
from the other parent so something else
 
05:19:07.590 --> 05:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
happened this parent did not have that
 
05:19:09.548 --> 05:19:09.558 align:start position:0%
child in their care at
 
05:19:12.788 --> 05:19:12.798 align:start position:0%
all ever at that point you could put in
 
05:19:14.788 --> 05:19:14.798 align:start position:0%
in an amendment to say the results of
 
05:19:17.230 --> 05:19:17.240 align:start position:0%
the you know maybe put an amendment in
 
05:19:19.510 --> 05:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
there change the wording a little bit so
 
05:19:22.510 --> 05:19:22.520 align:start position:0%
it's I think this is this this is
 
05:19:26.548 --> 05:19:26.558 align:start position:0%
raising a lot of alarms with parents I I
 
05:19:28.708 --> 05:19:28.718 align:start position:0%
totally understand that so and we need
 
05:19:32.350 --> 05:19:32.360 align:start position:0%
to put that fire out because it's making
 
05:19:36.910 --> 05:19:36.920 align:start position:0%
them nervous so how do we ease that we
 
05:19:40.110 --> 05:19:40.120 align:start position:0%
appreciate the work you're doing I do
 
05:19:43.390 --> 05:19:43.400 align:start position:0%
see you're doing a it's good work but
 
05:19:46.230 --> 05:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
how do we put the Flames out over here
 
05:19:49.670 --> 05:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
what can we do to calm that down I think
 
05:19:51.430 --> 05:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
the importance with that piece would be
 
05:19:53.190 --> 05:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
education for those parents to
 
05:19:55.310 --> 05:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
understand that abuse or neglect must
 
05:19:57.390 --> 05:19:57.400 align:start position:0%
come first in these instances and I
 
05:19:59.670 --> 05:19:59.680 align:start position:0%
think what we have heard from feedback
 
05:20:02.030 --> 05:20:02.040 align:start position:0%
directly um separate you know from your
 
05:20:04.510 --> 05:20:04.520 align:start position:0%
examples is that folks in the Family
 
05:20:06.788 --> 05:20:06.798 align:start position:0%
Court realm are very worried about this
 
05:20:08.708 --> 05:20:08.718 align:start position:0%
but this would never apply to them and
 
05:20:10.430 --> 05:20:10.440 align:start position:0%
so I do believe it's education to them
 
05:20:13.070 --> 05:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
to say this wouldn't apply to you
 
05:20:16.070 --> 05:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
because you're not acting abusively and
 
05:20:18.390 --> 05:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
you're not neglecting your child it
 
05:20:20.990 --> 05:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
would have to take that first so given
 
05:20:22.990 --> 05:20:23.000 align:start position:0%
that example of a child who's choosing
 
05:20:25.310 --> 05:20:25.320 align:start position:0%
that they may want to shift their
 
05:20:27.910 --> 05:20:27.920 align:start position:0%
identity at a certain age they are in a
 
05:20:31.270 --> 05:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
family home DCF would have to have a
 
05:20:33.548 --> 05:20:33.558 align:start position:0%
finding of abuse or neglect of that
 
05:20:36.788 --> 05:20:36.798 align:start position:0%
child before becoming involved in this
 
05:20:42.310 --> 05:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
applying and parents struggling with or
 
05:20:45.708 --> 05:20:45.718 align:start position:0%
not supporting their child's identity
 
05:20:47.150 --> 05:20:47.160 align:start position:0%
and their and their choice and changing
 
05:20:50.510 --> 05:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
their identity does not rise to the
 
05:20:53.390 --> 05:20:53.400 align:start position:0%
level of abuse or neglect by the current
 
05:20:57.430 --> 05:20:57.440 align:start position:0%
statute that we have nor any proposed
 
05:21:00.430 --> 05:21:00.440 align:start position:0%
changes to any abuse and neglect laws is
 
05:21:03.628 --> 05:21:03.638 align:start position:0%
the intent of any of that to add to that
 
05:21:05.750 --> 05:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
a parent not supporting their child
 
05:21:08.628 --> 05:21:08.638 align:start position:0%
transitioning now we do understand that
 
05:21:11.110 --> 05:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
transitioning can lead to things like
 
05:21:14.750 --> 05:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
suicidal ideation so if again after the
 
05:21:16.350 --> 05:21:16.360 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect already occurs and a
 
05:21:18.390 --> 05:21:18.400 align:start position:0%
parent is coming in and that child had
 
05:21:19.750 --> 05:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
already been removed from that primary
 
05:21:21.510 --> 05:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
parent and the other parents to take
 
05:21:22.948 --> 05:21:22.958 align:start position:0%
them and they're meeting them for the
 
05:21:24.190 --> 05:21:24.200 align:start position:0%
first time and the child is saying I
 
05:21:25.788 --> 05:21:25.798 align:start position:0%
don't want to be called Sally anymore I
 
05:21:27.670 --> 05:21:27.680 align:start position:0%
want you to call me Johnny and that
 
05:21:29.910 --> 05:21:29.920 align:start position:0%
other parent is saying I don't know
 
05:21:32.310 --> 05:21:32.320 align:start position:0%
about this I don't feel
 
05:21:34.350 --> 05:21:34.360 align:start position:0%
comfortable the court can look at that
 
05:21:35.708 --> 05:21:35.718 align:start position:0%
and say are you meeting your child's
 
05:21:37.948 --> 05:21:37.958 align:start position:0%
unique needs are you open to the
 
05:21:39.590 --> 05:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
conversation are you abusing your child
 
05:21:41.150 --> 05:21:41.160 align:start position:0%
because of it are you putting them down
 
05:21:43.390 --> 05:21:43.400 align:start position:0%
because of it or are you telling them I
 
05:21:44.990 --> 05:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
don't understand that concept I don't
 
05:21:47.788 --> 05:21:47.798 align:start position:0%
necessarily support that concept
 
05:21:50.030 --> 05:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
but you can take the time to figure out
 
05:21:51.670 --> 05:21:51.680 align:start position:0%
your identity you can talk to other
 
05:21:53.350 --> 05:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
folks but you know you can do what you
 
05:21:57.070 --> 05:21:57.080 align:start position:0%
need to I to process that but I don't
 
05:22:01.070 --> 05:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
understand and accept that that's not me
 
05:22:04.750 --> 05:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
that's not the level of abuse or neglect
 
05:22:06.470 --> 05:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
now if that parents if that child then
 
05:22:07.990 --> 05:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
says well my parent doesn't support me
 
05:22:09.390 --> 05:22:09.400 align:start position:0%
and now I'm suicidal and that parent
 
05:22:10.750 --> 05:22:10.760 align:start position:0%
says well you're suicidal too bad you're
 
05:22:13.030 --> 05:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
on your own now we're talking at the
 
05:22:14.070 --> 05:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
point where it could be getting to a
 
05:22:15.750 --> 05:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
level of neglect now if that parent says
 
05:22:17.470 --> 05:22:17.480 align:start position:0%
you're suicidal because you have an
 
05:22:19.230 --> 05:22:19.240 align:start position:0%
identity crisis that I can't support you
 
05:22:20.788 --> 05:22:20.798 align:start position:0%
in but I'll bring you to the hospital
 
05:22:22.110 --> 05:22:22.120 align:start position:0%
and make sure that you get treatment so
 
05:22:24.750 --> 05:22:24.760 align:start position:0%
that your suicidal ideation is addressed
 
05:22:25.948 --> 05:22:25.958 align:start position:0%
well that parent is taking the
 
05:22:27.590 --> 05:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate steps to have their child's
 
05:22:29.990 --> 05:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
needs met so they are still doing that
 
05:22:31.590 --> 05:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
so that's where I think the education
 
05:22:33.830 --> 05:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
piece and talking about it more is
 
05:22:36.628 --> 05:22:36.638 align:start position:0%
really helpful because I I truly I agree
 
05:22:39.310 --> 05:22:39.320 align:start position:0%
with attorney masio here that I do not
 
05:22:41.830 --> 05:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
believe that the folks you were hearing
 
05:22:45.350 --> 05:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
from would be involved in these hearings
 
05:22:47.270 --> 05:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
at any time they clearly are invested in
 
05:22:48.948 --> 05:22:48.958 align:start position:0%
their children's lives and and have that
 
05:22:52.110 --> 05:22:52.120 align:start position:0%
custody so it would not impact them but
 
05:22:54.310 --> 05:22:54.320 align:start position:0%
there could be future education and we
 
05:22:56.190 --> 05:22:56.200 align:start position:0%
are happy to have these conversations
 
05:22:57.708 --> 05:22:57.718 align:start position:0%
with folks to ease their worries that is
 
05:23:00.110 --> 05:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
not a Target at them all right the chair
 
05:23:02.510 --> 05:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
is going to jump in here with a real
 
05:23:05.230 --> 05:23:05.240 align:start position:0%
concerned I have seven more pink cards
 
05:23:09.708 --> 05:23:09.718 align:start position:0%
yes we have to exact we have to exec two
 
05:23:12.390 --> 05:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
of these bills including this one so I'm
 
05:23:15.948 --> 05:23:15.958 align:start position:0%
going to um put a a restriction order on
 
05:23:18.190 --> 05:23:18.200 align:start position:0%
everyone now to testify for three
 
05:23:20.310 --> 05:23:20.320 align:start position:0%
minutes I'm also going to ask the
 
05:23:22.110 --> 05:23:22.120 align:start position:0%
committee here if you don't need to ask
 
05:23:25.150 --> 05:23:25.160 align:start position:0%
the question don't ask the question uh
 
05:23:27.788 --> 05:23:27.798 align:start position:0%
simply because we have no other
 
05:23:30.030 --> 05:23:30.040 align:start position:0%
options I'm quite prepared to stay here
 
05:23:31.750 --> 05:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
till 10 o'clock at night but I don't
 
05:23:34.708 --> 05:23:34.718 align:start position:0%
think I'll have a quum at that point so
 
05:23:37.310 --> 05:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for your testimony thank
 
05:23:39.990 --> 05:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
you I did bring
 
05:23:44.868 --> 05:23:44.878 align:start position:0%

good and when we go to watch that video

05:24:26.350 --> 05:24:26.360 align:start position:0%
description of NAMI it's in my written
 
05:24:28.628 --> 05:24:28.638 align:start position:0%
testimony and I'm sure you know it by
 
05:24:31.868 --> 05:24:31.878 align:start position:0%
now um just a couple of things you've
 
05:24:33.910 --> 05:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
heard a lot about this bill so I just
 
05:24:36.708 --> 05:24:36.718 align:start position:0%
want to point out that um research has
 
05:24:39.110 --> 05:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
found that compared with siblings who
 
05:24:41.230 --> 05:24:41.240 align:start position:0%
remained at home children's placed out
 
05:24:42.868 --> 05:24:42.878 align:start position:0%
of the home had increased risks of
 
05:24:45.350 --> 05:24:45.360 align:start position:0%

either by Suicide or injury in adulthood
 
05:24:55.548 --> 05:24:55.558 align:start position:0%
and it further found that a foster home
 
05:24:58.190 --> 05:24:58.200 align:start position:0%
is better than an institution um and
 
05:25:01.868 --> 05:25:01.878 align:start position:0%
that having only um a one and only
 
05:25:04.868 --> 05:25:04.878 align:start position:0%
stable placement is important uh for
 
05:25:07.030 --> 05:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
child stability and well-being into
 
05:25:09.868 --> 05:25:09.878 align:start position:0%
adulthood um you've heard about what
 
05:25:12.788 --> 05:25:12.798 align:start position:0%
this bill does so I will not um I will
 
05:25:16.070 --> 05:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
spare you that as well um but we do know
 
05:25:17.350 --> 05:25:17.360 align:start position:0%
that children have much better
 
05:25:19.590 --> 05:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
Developmental and mental health outcomes
 
05:25:21.590 --> 05:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
when treatment is provided as close to
 
05:25:23.628 --> 05:25:23.638 align:start position:0%
the family and community of origin as
 
05:25:25.390 --> 05:25:25.400 align:start position:0%
possible and where the family
 
05:25:27.070 --> 05:25:27.080 align:start position:0%
connections can be preserved and you've
 
05:25:29.190 --> 05:25:29.200 align:start position:0%
heard that this bill would do that
 
05:25:31.430 --> 05:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
additionally as referenced above um
 
05:25:33.910 --> 05:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
children experience Better Health and
 
05:25:36.350 --> 05:25:36.360 align:start position:0%

placements are not in institu settings
 
05:25:41.868 --> 05:25:41.878 align:start position:0%
but are in things like foster homes um
 
05:25:44.788 --> 05:25:44.798 align:start position:0%
so Senate Bill 417 promotes uh better
 
05:25:46.390 --> 05:25:46.400 align:start position:0%
mental health outcomes for New
 
05:25:48.270 --> 05:25:48.280 align:start position:0%

the wording that's in the bill now would
 
05:26:10.430 --> 05:26:10.440 align:start position:0%
meet the vision that you just exposed
 
05:26:13.788 --> 05:26:13.798 align:start position:0%
yes um as you heard from the office of

05:26:58.150 --> 05:26:58.160 align:start position:0%

Law Center of New Hampshire also
 
05:27:07.670 --> 05:27:07.680 align:start position:0%
strongly supporting this bill and it
 
05:27:09.430 --> 05:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
won't take a out of your time I think
 
05:27:11.868 --> 05:27:11.878 align:start position:0%
it's really important to keep in mind
 
05:27:13.830 --> 05:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
that all of these children that we're
 
05:27:15.670 --> 05:27:15.680 align:start position:0%
talking about who are court involved
 
05:27:18.190 --> 05:27:18.200 align:start position:0%
whether they are in the Juvenile Justice
 
05:27:20.110 --> 05:27:20.120 align:start position:0%
System they're in the abuse and neglect
 
05:27:23.470 --> 05:27:23.480 align:start position:0%
system they are in chins they most of
 
05:27:25.910 --> 05:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
them have mental illness of some sort or
 
05:27:28.070 --> 05:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
some other kind of Behavioral challenges
 
05:27:30.548 --> 05:27:30.558 align:start position:0%
and 100% of them are going to be coming
 
05:27:33.868 --> 05:27:33.878 align:start position:0%
home at some point and where is home and
 
05:27:35.868 --> 05:27:35.878 align:start position:0%
how are they going to have the most
 
05:27:38.948 --> 05:27:38.958 align:start position:0%
successful re-entries to their home
 
05:27:41.390 --> 05:27:41.400 align:start position:0%
well if we can avoid re-entry by keeping
 
05:27:43.430 --> 05:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
them in their homes that's the gold
 
05:27:45.910 --> 05:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
standard if we can put Services into
 
05:27:48.788 --> 05:27:48.798 align:start position:0%
place that will keep families strong and
 
05:27:51.548 --> 05:27:51.558 align:start position:0%
keep families together that's that's
 
05:27:53.708 --> 05:27:53.718 align:start position:0%
really what we should be aiming for and
 
05:27:56.190 --> 05:27:56.200 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill would require and
 
05:27:57.708 --> 05:27:57.718 align:start position:0%
it also the other thing that's really
 
05:28:00.310 --> 05:28:00.320 align:start position:0%
important about 417 is that it creates
 
05:28:03.670 --> 05:28:03.680 align:start position:0%
an order of preference recognizing again
 
05:28:05.430 --> 05:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
the children are going to do better when
 
05:28:08.230 --> 05:28:08.240 align:start position:0%
they can maintain connections with
 
05:28:10.310 --> 05:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
whether it's with their biological or
 
05:28:12.670 --> 05:28:12.680 align:start position:0%
adoptive families they're friends I mean
 
05:28:14.350 --> 05:28:14.360 align:start position:0%
think about teenagers who do they care
 
05:28:15.990 --> 05:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
about they're friends they're not going
 
05:28:18.110 --> 05:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
to school to learn Shakespeare they need
 
05:28:19.990 --> 05:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
to be with the communities and the
 
05:28:21.430 --> 05:28:21.440 align:start position:0%
people and the leaders in their
 
05:28:23.788 --> 05:28:23.798 align:start position:0%
communities that are going to be those
 
05:28:26.070 --> 05:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
mentors and people that are going to be
 
05:28:28.190 --> 05:28:28.200 align:start position:0%
important to them while they're court
 
05:28:30.590 --> 05:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
involved and also when they're no longer
 
05:28:33.548 --> 05:28:33.558 align:start position:0%
court involved so the order of
 
05:28:36.190 --> 05:28:36.200 align:start position:0%
preference is super important to my
 
05:28:38.830 --> 05:28:38.840 align:start position:0%
organization as well as to the rest the
 
05:28:41.670 --> 05:28:41.680 align:start position:0%
jrpg and oversight is also really
 
05:28:44.190 --> 05:28:44.200 align:start position:0%
important for those instances when
 
05:28:47.070 --> 05:28:47.080 align:start position:0%
children's needs cannot be met in their
 
05:28:49.310 --> 05:28:49.320 align:start position:0%
homes or in a foster home when there's
 
05:28:51.788 --> 05:28:51.798 align:start position:0%
no fictive kin or people in their lives
 
05:28:53.390 --> 05:28:53.400 align:start position:0%
who can take them at these terrible
 
05:28:56.030 --> 05:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
junctures in their lives we want to make
 
05:28:58.030 --> 05:28:58.040 align:start position:0%
sure that they are safe and that there's
 
05:29:01.470 --> 05:29:01.480 align:start position:0%
adequate onsite eyes on oversight and
 
05:29:03.990 --> 05:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
that courts are thoroughly considering
 
05:29:06.230 --> 05:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
what the children's needs are and that
 
05:29:08.788 --> 05:29:08.798 align:start position:0%
we're not keeping kids even kids who
 
05:29:11.110 --> 05:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
need a brief therapeutic placement that
 
05:29:12.990 --> 05:29:13.000 align:start position:0%
they're not being kept too long because
 
05:29:14.788 --> 05:29:14.798 align:start position:0%
then there's diminishing returns and
 
05:29:16.310 --> 05:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
they're not going to benefit from that
 
05:29:18.948 --> 05:29:18.958 align:start position:0%
treatment so for all of those reasons I
 
05:29:22.190 --> 05:29:22.200 align:start position:0%
encourage you to support s417 and I'm
 
05:29:23.830 --> 05:29:23.840 align:start position:0%

know we have worked with the OCA on many
 
05:30:28.548 --> 05:30:28.558 align:start position:0%
iterations of this to try to bring it to
 
05:30:30.788 --> 05:30:30.798 align:start position:0%
a place that we can all agree to and
 
05:30:33.390 --> 05:30:33.400 align:start position:0%
specifically um section six just
 
05:30:35.868 --> 05:30:35.878 align:start position:0%
requires that dcyf expand their monthly
 
05:30:38.708 --> 05:30:38.718 align:start position:0%
visits to youth who are in placement and
 
05:30:40.628 --> 05:30:40.638 align:start position:0%
with that includes a broader tour of the
 
05:30:42.230 --> 05:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
facility as well as discussions with
 
05:30:44.990 --> 05:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
providers outside of the monthly care
 
05:30:47.670 --> 05:30:47.680 align:start position:0%
coordination meetings um staff make
 
05:30:49.910 --> 05:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
attempts to to have those discussions
 
05:30:52.190 --> 05:30:52.200 align:start position:0%
with those providers in person but we
 
05:30:55.070 --> 05:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate the flexibility within s417
 
05:30:56.990 --> 05:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
to allow some of those visits to occur
 
05:30:59.590 --> 05:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
real time virtually over the phone as
 
05:31:03.230 --> 05:31:03.240 align:start position:0%
needed sometimes things happen and our
 
05:31:05.670 --> 05:31:05.680 align:start position:0%
staff can't can't track down those those
 
05:31:07.390 --> 05:31:07.400 align:start position:0%
staff members whether it be vacation or
 
05:31:10.030 --> 05:31:10.040 align:start position:0%
something like that that um I do want to
 
05:31:11.670 --> 05:31:11.680 align:start position:0%
address however some of the items that
 
05:31:13.910 --> 05:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
have come up in today's discussion I
 
05:31:17.430 --> 05:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
have I was running back so I only caught
 
05:31:20.110 --> 05:31:20.120 align:start position:0%
half of I believe the oca's statements
 
05:31:22.590 --> 05:31:22.600 align:start position:0%
um one of which is addressing the
 
05:31:26.310 --> 05:31:26.320 align:start position:0%
Staffing requests on behalf of DHHS the
 
05:31:28.868 --> 05:31:28.878 align:start position:0%
way fiscal notes work is that we have to
 
05:31:31.788 --> 05:31:31.798 align:start position:0%
look at each bill individually in a
 
05:31:34.390 --> 05:31:34.400 align:start position:0%
vacuum four corners of that document we
 
05:31:36.868 --> 05:31:36.878 align:start position:0%
can't take into account other bills that
 
05:31:39.190 --> 05:31:39.200 align:start position:0%
are going through the process proc so
 
05:31:41.230 --> 05:31:41.240 align:start position:0%
with that that's why it looks like it is
 
05:31:44.830 --> 05:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
a bundling or a a larger number of staff
 
05:31:46.948 --> 05:31:46.958 align:start position:0%
could there be overlap of some of these
 
05:31:49.390 --> 05:31:49.400 align:start position:0%
responsibilities possibly but we cannot
 
05:31:51.070 --> 05:31:51.080 align:start position:0%
take that into account when we draft our
 
05:31:54.910 --> 05:31:54.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal notes and so that was a large
 
05:31:58.548 --> 05:31:58.558 align:start position:0%
number I will admit however to make a
 
05:32:00.590 --> 05:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
statement saying that we are asking for
 
05:32:03.910 --> 05:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
66 staff total obviously that would have
 
05:32:05.948 --> 05:32:05.958 align:start position:0%
to be readdressed should all of those
 
05:32:09.590 --> 05:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
bills with all of those parameters
 
05:32:12.830 --> 05:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
pass um one item of note also was
 
05:32:14.430 --> 05:32:14.440 align:start position:0%
increasing the
 
05:32:17.470 --> 05:32:17.480 align:start position:0%
hearings yes we do require more staff as
 
05:32:20.390 --> 05:32:20.400 align:start position:0%
they are as we increase the number of
 
05:32:23.190 --> 05:32:23.200 align:start position:0%
hearings part of that is it's not just
 
05:32:26.350 --> 05:32:26.360 align:start position:0%
one extra hearing it is with each
 
05:32:28.830 --> 05:32:28.840 align:start position:0%
additional hearing comes an extra day of
 
05:32:30.750 --> 05:32:30.760 align:start position:0%
Staff preparation it takes a full day
 
05:32:33.310 --> 05:32:33.320 align:start position:0%
for staff to prep for a hearing and then
 
05:32:35.430 --> 05:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
on top of that an additional day for
 
05:32:37.948 --> 05:32:37.958 align:start position:0%
them to sit at the courthouse almost all
 
05:32:40.750 --> 05:32:40.760 align:start position:0%
day waiting for that hearing to come up
 
05:32:42.548 --> 05:32:42.558 align:start position:0%
so unfortunately that's an additional
 
05:32:46.708 --> 05:32:46.718 align:start position:0%
two days per child per hearing again
 
05:32:48.788 --> 05:32:48.798 align:start position:0%
this the staff doesn't mind doing that
 
05:32:50.510 --> 05:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
that it especially if it's prescribed in
 
05:32:52.990 --> 05:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
law but rather to say that it doesn't
 
05:32:55.548 --> 05:32:55.558 align:start position:0%
take more time is is not accurate our
 
05:32:58.110 --> 05:32:58.120 align:start position:0%
staff has gone over this with me quite a
 
05:32:59.470 --> 05:32:59.480 align:start position:0%
bit I've learned more about the court
 
05:33:01.230 --> 05:33:01.240 align:start position:0%
system than I probably care to know
 
05:33:04.390 --> 05:33:04.400 align:start position:0%
about you can go to law school with
 
05:33:07.430 --> 05:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
me um and lastly one thing I do want to
 
05:33:10.070 --> 05:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
bring is the the case load and I know
 
05:33:13.990 --> 05:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
it's a kind of an a side quest a a side
 
05:33:18.110 --> 05:33:18.120 align:start position:0%
topic however as we we talked about case
 
05:33:24.190 --> 05:33:24.200 align:start position:0%
load for staff um yes we have 11 cases
 
05:33:27.110 --> 05:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
per staff sorry I'm pulling up an email
 
05:33:29.270 --> 05:33:29.280 align:start position:0%
um that addresses some of
 
05:33:33.270 --> 05:33:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:36.590 --> 05:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
actually National policy and I would say
 
05:33:38.910 --> 05:33:38.920 align:start position:0%
it is now I can't think of the name of
 
05:33:42.430 --> 05:33:42.440 align:start position:0%
the organization however that we'd not
 
05:33:45.788 --> 05:33:45.798 align:start position:0%
look at case load or the number of cases
 
05:33:49.190 --> 05:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
but rather the workload so as these
 
05:33:52.070 --> 05:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
cases are more difficult they are more
 
05:33:55.510 --> 05:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
complex fewer cases is actually better
 
05:33:57.868 --> 05:33:57.878 align:start position:0%
because of the fact that they have
 
05:34:00.948 --> 05:34:00.958 align:start position:0%
larger needs to meet within each case so
 
05:34:03.430 --> 05:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
11 cases but they could take twice as
 
05:34:05.548 --> 05:34:05.558 align:start position:0%
long as your average case elsewhere
 
05:34:07.390 --> 05:34:07.400 align:start position:0%
within the system so we just want to
 
05:34:09.590 --> 05:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
address that as well we have a low case
 
05:34:11.430 --> 05:34:11.440 align:start position:0%
load and that was part of the previous
 
05:34:14.070 --> 05:34:14.080 align:start position:0%
DCF Administration to bring that case
 
05:34:16.030 --> 05:34:16.040 align:start position:0%
load down so that we don't create
 
05:34:18.310 --> 05:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
burnout we don't create high turnover we
 
05:34:20.868 --> 05:34:20.878 align:start position:0%
don't lose valuable staff to the
 
05:34:23.030 --> 05:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
department and in order to do that we
 
05:34:24.670 --> 05:34:24.680 align:start position:0%
have to keep their workload at a
 
05:34:27.070 --> 05:34:27.080 align:start position:0%
reasonable manageable
 
05:34:29.590 --> 05:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
level so that's all I have if you have
 
05:34:32.788 --> 05:34:32.798 align:start position:0%
any questions a recent redo of the needs
 
05:34:36.310 --> 05:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
of the judicial system were based not on
 
05:34:39.190 --> 05:34:39.200 align:start position:0%
on cases but but actually actual real
 
05:34:41.868 --> 05:34:41.878 align:start position:0%
time it's a fascinating read when you're
 
05:34:44.150 --> 05:34:44.160 align:start position:0%
done reading Lexus Nexus that may be the
 
05:34:48.750 --> 05:34:48.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:51.230 --> 05:34:51.240 align:start position:0%
questions representative Raymond uh
 
05:34:52.590 --> 05:34:52.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I just wanted to
 
05:34:55.670 --> 05:34:55.680 align:start position:0%
follow up on the um Staffing
 
05:34:57.868 --> 05:34:57.878 align:start position:0%
requirements of the bills because um
 
05:35:00.150 --> 05:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
even as I looked at this one I thought I
 
05:35:01.510 --> 05:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
mean it's good that we're going to have
 
05:35:04.430 --> 05:35:04.440 align:start position:0%
the same case workers visiting the same
 
05:35:05.708 --> 05:35:05.718 align:start position:0%
kids instead of having this like
 
05:35:09.910 --> 05:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
shuffling thing but eight seemed like a
 
05:35:13.350 --> 05:35:13.360 align:start position:0%
lot to me for the seven kids we have out
 
05:35:16.230 --> 05:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
of state right now so can you give us an
 
05:35:20.270 --> 05:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
idea of total say we pass all three
 
05:35:23.190 --> 05:35:23.200 align:start position:0%
bills how many staff do you like
 
05:35:26.110 --> 05:35:26.120 align:start position:0%
realistically need it can be a range if
 
05:35:28.470 --> 05:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
all three bills change with their
 
05:35:30.708 --> 05:35:30.718 align:start position:0%
individual uh new requirements I would
 
05:35:32.230 --> 05:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
not be able to give that to you off the
 
05:35:34.470 --> 05:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
top of my head that would have to that
 
05:35:35.750 --> 05:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
that would take probably about a week's
 
05:35:37.990 --> 05:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
worth of review for the staff to come up
 
05:35:42.590 --> 05:35:42.600 align:start position:0%
with okay so but oh sorry that's okay I
 
05:35:43.868 --> 05:35:43.878 align:start position:0%
was going to say and it really depends
 
05:35:45.708 --> 05:35:45.718 align:start position:0%
on the nuances of each of the bills but
 
05:35:47.750 --> 05:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
it's not just the seven youth that are
 
05:35:51.470 --> 05:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
currently placed outside of New England
 
05:35:56.628 --> 05:35:56.638 align:start position:0%
it's the 12 additional visits for each
 
05:35:59.590 --> 05:35:59.600 align:start position:0%
worker um to all of the New England
 
05:36:02.030 --> 05:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
programs and so when you're adding that
 
05:36:04.910 --> 05:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
up it really is is looking at we may
 
05:36:06.628 --> 05:36:06.638 align:start position:0%
have had somebody from the Lancaster
 
05:36:09.230 --> 05:36:09.240 align:start position:0%
office visit or uh North Country office
 
05:36:11.670 --> 05:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
vis a youth in a Lancaster program that
 
05:36:14.628 --> 05:36:14.638 align:start position:0%
now we're having the the worker from
 
05:36:17.990 --> 05:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
Salem driving up to Lancaster 11 more
 
05:36:20.270 --> 05:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
times or however many more times so I
 
05:36:22.030 --> 05:36:22.040 align:start position:0%
think the travel time can be equal
 
05:36:23.670 --> 05:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
across New Hampshire as it can be for
 
05:36:25.708 --> 05:36:25.718 align:start position:0%
some of our national programs yeah
 
05:36:30.110 --> 05:36:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:32.590 --> 05:36:32.600 align:start position:0%
you seeing no further questions thank
 
05:36:35.830 --> 05:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
you so much chair recognizes Mr Joseph
 
05:36:42.670 --> 05:36:42.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:45.430 --> 05:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
and we are going to put uh you on a like
 
05:36:47.270 --> 05:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
wait have with the others three minutes
 
05:36:49.470 --> 05:36:49.480 align:start position:0%
because of a massive time crunch we're
 
05:36:52.590 --> 05:36:52.600 align:start position:0%
under all right thank you I am Joseph
 
05:36:55.430 --> 05:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
noon from Haner uh everything I am about
 
05:36:57.350 --> 05:36:57.360 align:start position:0%
to say is the truth and nothing but the
 
05:36:58.990 --> 05:36:59.000 align:start position:0%
truth so help me
 
05:37:03.110 --> 05:37:03.120 align:start position:0%
God uh this bill should be oppos first
 
05:37:07.948 --> 05:37:07.958 align:start position:0%
off uh this you know part 3G parents
 
05:37:09.830 --> 05:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
failure to cooperate with the rules of
 
05:37:11.750 --> 05:37:11.760 align:start position:0%

weighed as factor in the fitness of that
 
05:37:17.670 --> 05:37:17.680 align:start position:0%
parent I see this as a direct violation
 
05:37:19.510 --> 05:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
of your right to remain silent or your
 
05:37:21.190 --> 05:37:21.200 align:start position:0%
right not to furnish evidence against
 
05:37:23.788 --> 05:37:23.798 align:start position:0%
yourself specifically a direct violation
 
05:37:25.310 --> 05:37:25.320 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire Constitution
 
05:37:28.910 --> 05:37:28.920 align:start position:0%

there's also other Provisions within the

there's also other Provisions within the
Constitution

05:37:38.510 --> 05:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
Constitution
 
05:37:39.830 --> 05:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire Constitution that are
 
05:37:42.590 --> 05:37:42.600 align:start position:0%
very similar to the Fifth Amendment of
 
05:37:45.310 --> 05:37:45.320 align:start position:0%
the uh Federal Bill of Rights you have a
 
05:37:47.350 --> 05:37:47.360 align:start position:0%
right not to uh furnish evidence against
 
05:37:50.150 --> 05:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
yourself or testify against yourself
 
05:37:53.868 --> 05:37:53.878 align:start position:0%
furthermore we have part D where it says
 
05:37:57.110 --> 05:37:57.120 align:start position:0%
um gives terms like educational needs
 
05:37:59.350 --> 05:37:59.360 align:start position:0%
medical needs Health Care these are
 
05:38:01.910 --> 05:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
vague these need to be defined
 
05:38:03.750 --> 05:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
educational needs could be twisted and
 
05:38:05.948 --> 05:38:05.958 align:start position:0%
turned around by these guys simply as
 
05:38:07.470 --> 05:38:07.480 align:start position:0%
you didn't fill out this magical paper
 
05:38:08.830 --> 05:38:08.840 align:start position:0%
paperwork and you're your and you're
 
05:38:10.788 --> 05:38:10.798 align:start position:0%
homeschooling your children medical
 
05:38:13.190 --> 05:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
needs could be oh you didn't affirm
 
05:38:15.270 --> 05:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
their gender you didn't get them some
 
05:38:16.948 --> 05:38:16.958 align:start position:0%
kind of vaccine that doesn't have a
 
05:38:20.150 --> 05:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
double blind Placebo safety test to it
 
05:38:23.628 --> 05:38:23.638 align:start position:0%
uh you know or this Health Care stuff uh
 
05:38:25.548 --> 05:38:25.558 align:start position:0%
also I would like to say that social
 
05:38:25.558 --> 05:38:26.910 align:start position:0%
also I would like to say that social
workers

05:38:26.910 --> 05:38:26.920 align:start position:0%
workers
 
05:38:29.590 --> 05:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
lie I have evidence of them lying in
 
05:38:31.548 --> 05:38:31.558 align:start position:0%
fact I have some court documents I'm
 
05:38:32.990 --> 05:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
going to give you guys here in a second
 
05:38:34.708 --> 05:38:34.718 align:start position:0%
I didn't make multiple copies I didn't
 
05:38:37.110 --> 05:38:37.120 align:start position:0%
have the ability to do that uh but I was
 
05:38:39.830 --> 05:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
involved with a dcyf situation where a
 
05:38:43.670 --> 05:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
social worker presented a um assessment
 
05:38:47.150 --> 05:38:47.160 align:start position:0%
order to us from Family Court I rejected
 
05:38:48.910 --> 05:38:48.920 align:start position:0%
that particular social workers's offered
 
05:38:51.350 --> 05:38:51.360 align:start position:0%
a contract with me because it's all dcyf
 
05:38:52.910 --> 05:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
is doing is offering a contract a
 
05:38:54.910 --> 05:38:54.920 align:start position:0%
service they talk about giving you these
 
05:38:57.310 --> 05:38:57.320 align:start position:0%
services but they threaten you I was
 
05:38:59.350 --> 05:38:59.360 align:start position:0%
threatened by the social worker said if
 
05:39:00.830 --> 05:39:00.840 align:start position:0%
I did not comply with the assessment
 
05:39:02.430 --> 05:39:02.440 align:start position:0%
order they would be used against me and
 
05:39:04.030 --> 05:39:04.040 align:start position:0%
they would bring a contempt order
 
05:39:06.468 --> 05:39:06.478 align:start position:0%
against me so I did some research on New
 
05:39:09.310 --> 05:39:09.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire dcy F I did an internet search
 
05:39:12.548 --> 05:39:12.558 align:start position:0%
of the term nhdc YF settlements hundreds
 
05:39:14.230 --> 05:39:14.240 align:start position:0%

05:39:16.190 --> 05:39:16.200 align:start position:0%

Hampshire
 
05:39:26.830 --> 05:39:26.840 align:start position:0%
DCF furthermore I agreed to have this
 
05:39:29.910 --> 05:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
order this assessment done by the police
 
05:39:32.590 --> 05:39:32.600 align:start position:0%

give you guys is I have a narrative from
 
05:39:55.948 --> 05:39:55.958 align:start position:0%
the henker chief of police about this
 
05:39:58.670 --> 05:39:58.680 align:start position:0%
situation about the social workers lying
 
05:40:01.350 --> 05:40:01.360 align:start position:0%
uh also these social workers do not have
 
05:40:03.750 --> 05:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
Oaths of office and they are protected
 
05:40:07.030 --> 05:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
by RSA 99 qualified immunity I have a
 
05:40:09.548 --> 05:40:09.558 align:start position:0%
copy of a letter here that I received
 
05:40:11.708 --> 05:40:11.718 align:start position:0%
due to a a right to no request asking
 
05:40:14.150 --> 05:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
for bonding information and oath of
 
05:40:16.110 --> 05:40:16.120 align:start position:0%
office of Social Workers they do not
 
05:40:19.070 --> 05:40:19.080 align:start position:0%
have them uh that being
 
05:40:21.150 --> 05:40:21.160 align:start position:0%
said I
 
05:40:25.190 --> 05:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
uh uh the assessment was uh I I complied
 
05:40:27.468 --> 05:40:27.478 align:start position:0%
with the assessment by asking a police
 
05:40:30.030 --> 05:40:30.040 align:start position:0%
officer guy's name is Matt French chief
 
05:40:32.670 --> 05:40:32.680 align:start position:0%
of police of hener P PD to do this
 
05:40:35.110 --> 05:40:35.120 align:start position:0%
assessment to interview my 2-year-old
 
05:40:37.990 --> 05:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
daughter alone and to inspect my house
 
05:40:40.190 --> 05:40:40.200 align:start position:0%
when he went back to DCF they said no
 
05:40:41.788 --> 05:40:41.798 align:start position:0%
you can't do this you're not
 
05:40:44.868 --> 05:40:44.878 align:start position:0%
qualified but also DCF doesn't get the
 
05:40:48.110 --> 05:40:48.120 align:start position:0%
title for money uh incentive money from
 
05:40:50.030 --> 05:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
the Social Security Administration
 
05:40:52.110 --> 05:40:52.120 align:start position:0%
unless dcyf does the assessment from
 
05:40:53.990 --> 05:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
what I understand it's like a $6,000
 
05:40:56.150 --> 05:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
payout to DCF if the police do it they
 
05:40:58.190 --> 05:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
don't get the money and the social
 
05:41:00.270 --> 05:41:00.280 align:start position:0%
workers are trained in a program at
 
05:41:02.910 --> 05:41:02.920 align:start position:0%
Southern New Hampshire University called
 
05:41:06.070 --> 05:41:06.080 align:start position:0%
maximizing revenue for DCF how to
 
05:41:08.350 --> 05:41:08.360 align:start position:0%
maximize all this revenue for
 
05:41:12.070 --> 05:41:12.080 align:start position:0%
DCF furthermore after I told the hener
 
05:41:13.708 --> 05:41:13.718 align:start position:0%
chief of police I would allow him to do
 
05:41:17.150 --> 05:41:17.160 align:start position:0%
the assessment and the uh multiple
 
05:41:20.150 --> 05:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
social workers and lawyers Ross McLoud
 
05:41:22.030 --> 05:41:22.040 align:start position:0%
the lawyer social worker Melissa kums
 
05:41:25.788 --> 05:41:25.798 align:start position:0%
and supervisors at dcyf were hellbent on
 
05:41:27.750 --> 05:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
him not doing the assessment him and his
 
05:41:29.868 --> 05:41:29.878 align:start position:0%
officer you can read about it in the
 
05:41:31.590 --> 05:41:31.600 align:start position:0%
affidavit that he filed in family court
 
05:41:32.670 --> 05:41:32.680 align:start position:0%
that I'm going to give you here as part
 
05:41:37.350 --> 05:41:37.360 align:start position:0%
of these documents uh the uh social
 
05:41:40.150 --> 05:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
worker Melissa kums and Ross McLoud
 
05:41:43.510 --> 05:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
escalated this uh situation by filing a
 
05:41:45.468 --> 05:41:45.478 align:start position:0%
contempt order
 
05:41:48.548 --> 05:41:48.558 align:start position:0%
after uh I had asked that the police do
 
05:41:50.548 --> 05:41:50.558 align:start position:0%
this assessment which the right original
 
05:41:53.150 --> 05:41:53.160 align:start position:0%
assessment order says they can do and
 
05:41:55.910 --> 05:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
also you'll see if you go want your
 
05:41:57.350 --> 05:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
stomach will get turned when you
 
05:41:59.230 --> 05:41:59.240 align:start position:0%
internet search New Hampshire DCF
 
05:42:01.868 --> 05:42:01.878 align:start position:0%
settlements and start reading all of the
 
05:42:03.708 --> 05:42:03.718 align:start position:0%
uh newspaper articles and everything
 
05:42:07.468 --> 05:42:07.478 align:start position:0%
written in it about what's going on and
 
05:42:09.468 --> 05:42:09.478 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers are just forking out
 
05:42:11.270 --> 05:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
hundreds of millions of dollars quite
 
05:42:13.070 --> 05:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
literally and this is going to continue
 
05:42:15.750 --> 05:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
as long as dcyf exists and is operating
 
05:42:18.110 --> 05:42:18.120 align:start position:0%
without due process of law and is
 
05:42:20.670 --> 05:42:20.680 align:start position:0%
operating in Family Court which is not a
 
05:42:23.350 --> 05:42:23.360 align:start position:0%
court of record all of this stuff is
 
05:42:25.390 --> 05:42:25.400 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and the people are
 
05:42:27.350 --> 05:42:27.360 align:start position:0%
waking up they are learning about this
 
05:42:29.070 --> 05:42:29.080 align:start position:0%
stuff sir we're going to have to ask you
 
05:42:30.788 --> 05:42:30.798 align:start position:0%
to wrap it up I gave you three minutes
 
05:42:32.190 --> 05:42:32.200 align:start position:0%
but I got so intrigued with thought you
 
05:42:34.190 --> 05:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
were saying it's way over three can I
 
05:42:35.430 --> 05:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
give you one more minute please thank
 
05:42:40.548 --> 05:42:40.558 align:start position:0%
you so uh I oppose this bill I oppose uh
 
05:42:42.948 --> 05:42:42.958 align:start position:0%
that the parents exercising their
 
05:42:44.788 --> 05:42:44.798 align:start position:0%
constitutionally secured
 
05:42:47.750 --> 05:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
rights uh to not incriminate themselves
 
05:42:51.430 --> 05:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
being used against them I oppose family
 
05:42:53.830 --> 05:42:53.840 align:start position:0%
court operating without due process of
 
05:42:57.390 --> 05:42:57.400 align:start position:0%
law and I most and I oppose this uh on
 
05:42:58.830 --> 05:42:58.840 align:start position:0%
the behalf of the people of New
 
05:43:00.788 --> 05:43:00.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because the liabilities are
 
05:43:03.190 --> 05:43:03.200 align:start position:0%
going to increase if you give social
 
05:43:05.430 --> 05:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
workers any more power and if you hire
 
05:43:07.110 --> 05:43:07.120 align:start position:0%
more social workers there will be more
 
05:43:09.788 --> 05:43:09.798 align:start position:0%
more lawsuits and more liabilities uh
 
05:43:12.430 --> 05:43:12.440 align:start position:0%
this is quite massive and thank you for
 
05:43:12.440 --> 05:43:13.230 align:start position:0%

comprehensive and integrated system of
 
05:44:13.788 --> 05:44:13.798 align:start position:0%
care for children's mental
 
05:44:15.910 --> 05:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
health um we are here in strong support
 
05:44:18.350 --> 05:44:18.360 align:start position:0%
of Senate Bill 417 because it aligns the
 
05:44:20.070 --> 05:44:20.080 align:start position:0%
child protection statute with the system
 
05:44:23.110 --> 05:44:23.120 align:start position:0%
of care values such that um the children
 
05:44:24.948 --> 05:44:24.958 align:start position:0%
who are involved in both systems would
 
05:44:27.430 --> 05:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
have better mental health outcomes RSA
 
05:44:30.510 --> 05:44:30.520 align:start position:0%
135 established the system of care and
 
05:44:32.788 --> 05:44:32.798 align:start position:0%
put a heavy emphasis on community- based
 
05:44:35.548 --> 05:44:35.558 align:start position:0%
and evidence-based practices um because
 
05:44:37.468 --> 05:44:37.478 align:start position:0%
when children have treatment in their
 
05:44:38.670 --> 05:44:38.680 align:start position:0%
communities they have better mental
 
05:44:39.868 --> 05:44:39.878 align:start position:0%
health outcomes and when they use
 
05:44:41.590 --> 05:44:41.600 align:start position:0%
evidence-based practices they also have
 
05:44:43.430 --> 05:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
better mental health outcomes Senate
 
05:44:46.510 --> 05:44:46.520 align:start position:0%
Bill 417 integrates those principles
 
05:44:49.590 --> 05:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
into the child protection statute by um
 
05:44:52.628 --> 05:44:52.638 align:start position:0%
encou encouraging um families to stay
 
05:44:54.310 --> 05:44:54.320 align:start position:0%
together uh the in that order of
 
05:44:55.830 --> 05:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
placements that everybody's been talking
 
05:44:57.670 --> 05:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
about today it highlights the importance
 
05:44:58.990 --> 05:44:59.000 align:start position:0%
of keeping a family together in the
 
05:45:01.190 --> 05:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
first instance and only looking outside
 
05:45:03.190 --> 05:45:03.200 align:start position:0%
of the family when it's absolutely
 
05:45:05.628 --> 05:45:05.638 align:start position:0%
necessary for the safety of the child um
 
05:45:08.590 --> 05:45:08.600 align:start position:0%
and then after that going to Kin or
 
05:45:11.150 --> 05:45:11.160 align:start position:0%
fictive Kim um and then a homelike
 
05:45:12.990 --> 05:45:13.000 align:start position:0%
foster care setting where again children
 
05:45:15.310 --> 05:45:15.320 align:start position:0%
have better mental health outcomes we
 
05:45:18.190 --> 05:45:18.200 align:start position:0%
know that when kids are placed with um
 
05:45:21.468 --> 05:45:21.478 align:start position:0%
kin they have fewer changes in placement
 
05:45:23.548 --> 05:45:23.558 align:start position:0%
over time and have better mental uh
 
05:45:24.830 --> 05:45:24.840 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health outcomes for
 
05:45:28.628 --> 05:45:28.638 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health um behavioral uh
 
05:45:32.230 --> 05:45:32.240 align:start position:0%
issues um it's also nice to have kids in
 
05:45:34.510 --> 05:45:34.520 align:start position:0%
their communities um when kids are
 
05:45:37.070 --> 05:45:37.080 align:start position:0%
placed within their communities um they
 
05:45:39.270 --> 05:45:39.280 align:start position:0%
don't have to change schools they are
 
05:45:41.030 --> 05:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
there's continuity of care with their
 
05:45:42.430 --> 05:45:42.440 align:start position:0%
providers that they already have
 
05:45:44.468 --> 05:45:44.478 align:start position:0%
established and um they have better
 
05:45:46.390 --> 05:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
mental health outcomes um because they
 
05:45:48.310 --> 05:45:48.320 align:start position:0%
have the support and love of family and
 
05:45:51.030 --> 05:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
relatives nearby who can also um
 
05:45:53.910 --> 05:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
participate when appropriate in therapy
 
05:45:54.750 --> 05:45:54.760 align:start position:0%
with the
 
05:45:58.590 --> 05:45:58.600 align:start position:0%
child um and I go into more depth in my
 
05:46:02.350 --> 05:46:02.360 align:start position:0%
testimony but for those reasons um we
 
05:46:04.708 --> 05:46:04.718 align:start position:0%
urge you to support Senate bill for 17
 
05:46:06.150 --> 05:46:06.160 align:start position:0%

as amended and I'm happy to take any

may have uh seeking your guidance uh
 
05:46:42.150 --> 05:46:42.160 align:start position:0%
with the bill I I would like to say I
 
05:46:44.030 --> 05:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
know that you don't have a lot of time
 
05:46:45.390 --> 05:46:45.400 align:start position:0%
that we've appreciated we've had a lot
 
05:46:46.788 --> 05:46:46.798 align:start position:0%
of collaboration with the OCA with
 
05:46:48.830 --> 05:46:48.840 align:start position:0%
others with DHHS and we we've
 
05:46:50.390 --> 05:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
appreciated all the work that everyone
 
05:46:52.590 --> 05:46:52.600 align:start position:0%
has done already to meet some of these
 
05:46:55.468 --> 05:46:55.478 align:start position:0%
questions just uh two that I leave you
 
05:47:01.628 --> 05:47:01.638 align:start position:0%
with one is on page two at line 24 and
 
05:47:04.910 --> 05:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
Page four at line four uh there's some
 
05:47:06.510 --> 05:47:06.520 align:start position:0%
language presume that remaining in the
 
05:47:07.990 --> 05:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
family home is in the best interest of
 
05:47:13.070 --> 05:47:13.080 align:start position:0%
the child um under RSA 169-d colon
 
05:47:15.788 --> 05:47:15.798 align:start position:0%
19- that standard should be contrary to
 
05:47:17.868 --> 05:47:17.878 align:start position:0%
the welfare of the child unless you
 
05:47:20.390 --> 05:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
intend to change the standard which I I
 
05:47:22.310 --> 05:47:22.320 align:start position:0%
think it is not intended to be changed
 
05:47:24.030 --> 05:47:24.040 align:start position:0%
so I would recommend if that's not your
 
05:47:26.110 --> 05:47:26.120 align:start position:0%
intention to harmonize that standard
 
05:47:28.548 --> 05:47:28.558 align:start position:0%
might I suggest we're going to exec this
 
05:47:30.030 --> 05:47:30.040 align:start position:0%
spell in about 20 minutes we have no
 
05:47:34.430 --> 05:47:34.440 align:start position:0%
choice so if there's something that um
 
05:47:36.548 --> 05:47:36.558 align:start position:0%
uh really should be changed there's this
 
05:47:39.150 --> 05:47:39.160 align:start position:0%
group group called finance and they
 
05:47:41.310 --> 05:47:41.320 align:start position:0%
change things I met them you've met them
 
05:47:43.868 --> 05:47:43.878 align:start position:0%
before they like to change things so
 
05:47:45.990 --> 05:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
pass that on to them with my love C
 
05:47:48.030 --> 05:47:48.040 align:start position:0%
certainly will and the only other thing
 
05:47:49.468 --> 05:47:49.478 align:start position:0%
i' I'd like to just mention because it's
 
05:47:51.270 --> 05:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
a little bit of a policy direction that
 
05:47:53.390 --> 05:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
you the policy committee y might like to
 
05:47:56.670 --> 05:47:56.680 align:start position:0%
give is in about three places there's a
 
05:47:59.948 --> 05:47:59.958 align:start position:0%
reference to um neither the shortage or
 
05:48:02.030 --> 05:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
lack of foster family homes nor the lack
 
05:48:03.548 --> 05:48:03.558 align:start position:0%
of community- based resources shall be
 
05:48:04.948 --> 05:48:04.958 align:start position:0%
acceptable reasons for determining that
 
05:48:06.190 --> 05:48:06.200 align:start position:0%
the needs of the child cannot be met in
 
05:48:07.510 --> 05:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
a family setting
 
05:48:09.350 --> 05:48:09.360 align:start position:0%
I I've run that language by a couple
 
05:48:11.868 --> 05:48:11.878 align:start position:0%
judges just to see if they thought there
 
05:48:14.070 --> 05:48:14.080 align:start position:0%
was an implementation challenge there
 
05:48:15.350 --> 05:48:15.360 align:start position:0%
and I think there's a little bit of
 
05:48:16.548 --> 05:48:16.558 align:start position:0%
confusion about whether this is a
 
05:48:18.948 --> 05:48:18.958 align:start position:0%
directive from the policy committee not
 
05:48:20.990 --> 05:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
to place a child in residential care
 
05:48:25.070 --> 05:48:25.080 align:start position:0%
even if that is the only option um and
 
05:48:26.830 --> 05:48:26.840 align:start position:0%
this this is a scenario that can come up
 
05:48:28.430 --> 05:48:28.440 align:start position:0%
the language suggests that if it's not
 
05:48:30.030 --> 05:48:30.040 align:start position:0%
in the best interest of the child if
 
05:48:32.390 --> 05:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
that's not the best setting that that's
 
05:48:34.708 --> 05:48:34.718 align:start position:0%
potentially prohibitive uh if that's not
 
05:48:36.830 --> 05:48:36.840 align:start position:0%
your intention would just appreciate a
 
05:48:38.670 --> 05:48:38.680 align:start position:0%
little bit of a clarification Having
 
05:48:41.350 --> 05:48:41.360 align:start position:0%
learned how to think like a lawyer I I
 
05:48:43.270 --> 05:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
really could see that that's a squiffy
 
05:48:45.670 --> 05:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
statement and and it needs to be
 
05:48:49.350 --> 05:48:49.360 align:start position:0%
clarified and so finance will do that
 
05:48:50.750 --> 05:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
all right thank you Mr chairman
 
05:48:53.468 --> 05:48:53.478 align:start position:0%
appreciate the time anything
 
05:48:53.478 --> 05:48:55.110 align:start position:0%
appreciate the time anything
else

05:48:55.110 --> 05:48:55.120 align:start position:0%
else
 
05:48:59.750 --> 05:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
anyone okay thank you thank you and this
 
05:49:05.468 --> 05:49:05.478 align:start position:0%
uh concludes the hearing on Senate Bill
 
05:49:08.430 --> 05:49:08.440 align:start position:0%
417 now now let's take about a minute to
 
05:49:14.468 --> 05:49:14.478 align:start position:0%
breathe and we will open a um exec
 
05:49:18.590 --> 05:49:18.600 align:start position:0%
session on 463 very simply because it's
 
05:49:21.628 --> 05:49:21.638 align:start position:0%
likely to be easy we're going to either
 
05:49:24.430 --> 05:49:24.440 align:start position:0%
like the amendment proposed or not and
 
05:49:26.270 --> 05:49:26.280 align:start position:0%
then we can like the bill or not
 
05:49:27.750 --> 05:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
shouldn't take too long so let's take
 
05:49:35.628 --> 05:49:35.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:35.638 --> 05:50:05.628 align:start position:0%

05:55:11.868 --> 05:55:11.878 align:start position:0%
uh to the committee uh there's an
 
05:55:13.868 --> 05:55:13.878 align:start position:0%
amendment coming around please take this
 
05:55:16.548 --> 05:55:16.558 align:start position:0%
opportunity to read it we'll start the
 
05:55:18.350 --> 05:55:18.360 align:start position:0%
exact session in a couple of minutes
 
05:55:35.230 --> 05:55:35.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:35.240 --> 05:56:05.230 align:start position:0%
 
it

05:56:05.230 --> 05:56:05.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:05.240 --> 05:56:35.230 align:start position:0%

05:57:34.468 --> 05:57:34.478 align:start position:0%
opening the executive session on Senate
 
05:57:37.390 --> 05:57:37.400 align:start position:0%
Bill 4177 we start with looking at an
 
05:57:39.910 --> 05:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
amendment and you should have amendment
 
05:57:44.590 --> 05:57:44.600 align:start position:0%
20245 87h in front of you and this is in
 
05:57:47.110 --> 05:57:47.120 align:start position:0%
response to conversations with numbers
 
05:57:50.708 --> 05:57:50.718 align:start position:0%
of you from both parties and a whole
 
05:57:52.868 --> 05:57:52.878 align:start position:0%
slew of emails that are number of us
 
05:57:57.190 --> 05:57:57.200 align:start position:0%
have gotten lines 1 to 11 are not
 
05:58:00.468 --> 05:58:00.478 align:start position:0%
changing anything it's what's already
 
05:58:03.270 --> 05:58:03.280 align:start position:0%
there uh OS sometimes likes to give you
 
05:58:05.270 --> 05:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
a running start into where the changes
 
05:58:09.150 --> 05:58:09.160 align:start position:0%
are it the what is the operative thing
 
05:58:12.190 --> 05:58:12.200 align:start position:0%
has to do with line 16 to
 
05:58:16.310 --> 05:58:16.320 align:start position:0%
23 representative Panic articulated what
 
05:58:18.788 --> 05:58:18.798 align:start position:0%
a number of people have been
 
05:58:22.708 --> 05:58:22.718 align:start position:0%
saying and the wording in the original
 
05:58:25.628 --> 05:58:25.638 align:start position:0%
Bill the unique needs of the child and
 
05:58:27.548 --> 05:58:27.558 align:start position:0%
whether or not the parent is adequately
 
05:58:29.830 --> 05:58:29.840 align:start position:0%
prepared to address those needs is
 
05:58:33.430 --> 05:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
stricken in the amendment and while some
 
05:58:36.310 --> 05:58:36.320 align:start position:0%
have argued that this is a child who
 
05:58:38.628 --> 05:58:38.638 align:start position:0%
wishes to be transgender and the parents
 
05:58:41.910 --> 05:58:41.920 align:start position:0%
don't and therefore the child in uh is
 
05:58:44.270 --> 05:58:44.280 align:start position:0%
is uh dropping a dime on the parents
 
05:58:46.070 --> 05:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
they're not meeting my needs this could
 
05:58:48.750 --> 05:58:48.760 align:start position:0%
go the other way too and I am familiar
 
05:58:51.708 --> 05:58:51.718 align:start position:0%
with a case in an extremely red state
 
05:58:56.030 --> 05:58:56.040 align:start position:0%
with a child dressed as a Nazi gave Nazi
 
05:58:59.510 --> 05:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
salutes and went to websites and the
 
05:59:02.150 --> 05:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
parents said no and then the child said
 
05:59:03.468 --> 05:59:03.478 align:start position:0%
you're not meeting my
 
05:59:06.910 --> 05:59:06.920 align:start position:0%
needs so this isn't a
 
05:59:09.510 --> 05:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
right versus left left versus right this
 
05:59:13.270 --> 05:59:13.280 align:start position:0%
is a the language is way too broad uh
 
05:59:15.270 --> 05:59:15.280 align:start position:0%
that isn't to say other language could
 
05:59:17.788 --> 05:59:17.798 align:start position:0%
not be added at some point in the
 
05:59:22.230 --> 05:59:22.240 align:start position:0%
future but I know way too many people
 
05:59:24.948 --> 05:59:24.958 align:start position:0%
who would not vote for this bill because
 
05:59:28.390 --> 05:59:28.400 align:start position:0%
of that line item so this amendment
 
05:59:31.190 --> 05:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
first of all takes that out secondly and
 
05:59:32.868 --> 05:59:32.878 align:start position:0%
you heard the testimony from the
 
05:59:36.868 --> 05:59:36.878 align:start position:0%
gentleman on what has been numbered G
 
05:59:40.788 --> 05:59:40.798 align:start position:0%
originally it's now F but it continued a
 
05:59:42.670 --> 05:59:42.680 align:start position:0%
parents failure to cooperate with the
 
05:59:44.948 --> 05:59:44.958 align:start position:0%
Department's assessment or to provide
 
05:59:47.230 --> 05:59:47.240 align:start position:0%
any records necessary dot dot dot shall
 
05:59:49.030 --> 05:59:49.040 align:start position:0%
be weighed as a factor in the fitness of
 
05:59:52.670 --> 05:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
that parent that's a threat and while of
 
05:59:54.910 --> 05:59:54.920 align:start position:0%
course if you are there's a
 
05:59:57.708 --> 05:59:57.718 align:start position:0%
preponderance of evidence that you are
 
05:59:59.670 --> 05:59:59.680 align:start position:0%
harassing and not cooperating and
 
06:00:01.590 --> 06:00:01.600 align:start position:0%
running people off your land and all of
 
06:00:03.708 --> 06:00:03.718 align:start position:0%
that of course that's going to be taken
 
06:00:05.670 --> 06:00:05.680 align:start position:0%
into account but to put it specifically
 
06:00:10.390 --> 06:00:10.400 align:start position:0%
in here sounds to me like the literature
 
06:00:13.190 --> 06:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
I sometimes get from certain people in
 
06:00:15.708 --> 06:00:15.718 align:start position:0%
my party we are watching how you vote
 
06:00:18.628 --> 06:00:18.638 align:start position:0%
and we will take action accordingly I
 
06:00:20.670 --> 06:00:20.680 align:start position:0%
don't need to hear that I don't like to
 
06:00:25.350 --> 06:00:25.360 align:start position:0%
hear that so the in the amendment it's F
 
06:00:28.788 --> 06:00:28.798 align:start position:0%
which is the first half of the old G so
 
06:00:30.230 --> 06:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
those are the two things that
 
06:00:32.670 --> 06:00:32.680 align:start position:0%
representative Panic spoke to and a
 
06:00:36.110 --> 06:00:36.120 align:start position:0%
number of you and I have spoken on the
 
06:00:40.030 --> 06:00:40.040 align:start position:0%
second part of the amendment has to do
 
06:00:44.510 --> 06:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
with fictive Ken and if you turn over to
 
06:00:48.310 --> 06:00:48.320 align:start position:0%
page two it is line four Roman 3 there
 
06:00:51.948 --> 06:00:51.958 align:start position:0%
is no definition in statute on fictive
 
06:00:56.030 --> 06:00:56.040 align:start position:0%
Ken the clerk did some research for me
 
06:00:58.948 --> 06:00:58.958 align:start position:0%
um Miss Dia did some research for me
 
06:01:02.270 --> 06:01:02.280 align:start position:0%
there's language about kin and it is
 
06:01:05.030 --> 06:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
inferred or it may be inferred it means
 
06:01:08.110 --> 06:01:08.120 align:start position:0%
fictive kin but but it doesn't say it a
 
06:01:10.670 --> 06:01:10.680 align:start position:0%
National Organization of
 
06:01:12.990 --> 06:01:13.000 align:start position:0%
legislators um and some of us had lunch
 
06:01:14.670 --> 06:01:14.680 align:start position:0%
today with somebody well and we all
 
06:01:16.468 --> 06:01:16.478 align:start position:0%
heard from
 
06:01:19.350 --> 06:01:19.360 align:start position:0%
ncsl UM got together a group of people
 
06:01:22.270 --> 06:01:22.280 align:start position:0%
like us and came up with a definition of
 
06:01:26.910 --> 06:01:26.920 align:start position:0%
fictive kin and it reads as it says here
 
06:01:31.430 --> 06:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
and although I'm not a lawyer yet um I
 
06:01:33.628 --> 06:01:33.638 align:start position:0%
know that if a term is used in law and
 
06:01:36.670 --> 06:01:36.680 align:start position:0%
it's not defined you have a problem
 
06:01:40.230 --> 06:01:40.240 align:start position:0%
so here is a definition for fictive kin
 
06:01:41.468 --> 06:01:41.478 align:start position:0%
so what this
 
06:01:43.468 --> 06:01:43.478 align:start position:0%
amendment uh
 
06:01:47.190 --> 06:01:47.200 align:start position:0%
does uh Amendment 1587 is IT addresses
 
06:01:51.030 --> 06:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
two issues one is a couple of lines um
 
06:01:54.110 --> 06:01:54.120 align:start position:0%
having to do with
 
06:01:57.510 --> 06:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
um what what are the determinatives and
 
06:01:59.628 --> 06:01:59.638 align:start position:0%
then secondly the definition of fictive
 
06:02:04.030 --> 06:02:04.040 align:start position:0%
K and the um my vice chair uh says that
 
06:02:06.628 --> 06:02:06.638 align:start position:0%
he certainly has no difficult with this
 
06:02:08.830 --> 06:02:08.840 align:start position:0%
himself so it sounds this could be
 
06:02:11.868 --> 06:02:11.878 align:start position:0%
bipartisan so I before I move it I just
 
06:02:14.990 --> 06:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to sense reaction because I have
 
06:02:16.990 --> 06:02:17.000 align:start position:0%
a couple of other amendments I could put
 
06:02:19.590 --> 06:02:19.600 align:start position:0%
in if somehow this one doesn't make it
 
06:02:21.868 --> 06:02:21.878 align:start position:0%
yes representative Nelson thank you Mr
 
06:02:23.788 --> 06:02:23.798 align:start position:0%
chairman I do have one question if you
 
06:02:29.708 --> 06:02:29.718 align:start position:0%
could please um uh Enlighten us on um
 
06:02:33.590 --> 06:02:33.600 align:start position:0%
line um line six um a parent who has not
 
06:02:34.830 --> 06:02:34.840 align:start position:0%
been charged with abuse and neglect
 
06:02:36.750 --> 06:02:36.760 align:start position:0%
shall be afforded upon a full Hearing in
 
06:02:39.430 --> 06:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
the so District or family court was
 
06:02:42.628 --> 06:02:42.638 align:start position:0%
stricken and circuit court was inserted
 
06:02:45.030 --> 06:02:45.040 align:start position:0%
that is not my doing that is the bill
 
06:02:48.110 --> 06:02:48.120 align:start position:0%
before us and as I said at the beginning
 
06:02:51.830 --> 06:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
of my presentation sometimes OS likes to
 
06:02:55.548 --> 06:02:55.558 align:start position:0%
get us into the language that is already
 
06:02:57.990 --> 06:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
there in the bill that is not being
 
06:03:02.868 --> 06:03:02.878 align:start position:0%
amended so that I I think it's a mistake
 
06:03:05.390 --> 06:03:05.400 align:start position:0%
but yeah go um but in the bill it
 
06:03:07.990 --> 06:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't in this bill that we are seeing
 
06:03:10.430 --> 06:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
it's not in that bill in the bill it
 
06:03:12.628 --> 06:03:12.638 align:start position:0%
states full Hearing in the district or
 
06:03:14.468 --> 06:03:14.478 align:start position:0%
family C court regarding his or her
 
06:03:17.190 --> 06:03:17.200 align:start position:0%
ability to obtain
 
06:03:17.200 --> 06:03:21.310 align:start position:0%
ability to obtain
custody

06:03:21.310 --> 06:03:21.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:24.468 --> 06:03:24.478 align:start position:0%
huh you are correct but I think circuit
 
06:03:25.708 --> 06:03:25.718 align:start position:0%
is the correct
 
06:03:28.670 --> 06:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
term so thank you for that you you had
 
06:03:31.548 --> 06:03:31.558 align:start position:0%
that correct uh then again there's
 
06:03:34.830 --> 06:03:34.840 align:start position:0%
always attorney kigan when you need one
 
06:03:36.910 --> 06:03:36.920 align:start position:0%
sorry just uh wanted to mention that uh
 
06:03:38.468 --> 06:03:38.478 align:start position:0%
because the legislature Consolidated the
 
06:03:40.110 --> 06:03:40.120 align:start position:0%
family court and the district court as
 
06:03:42.110 --> 06:03:42.120 align:start position:0%
to Visions now of the Circuit Court
 
06:03:43.510 --> 06:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
whenever we open up a statute we
 
06:03:45.310 --> 06:03:45.320 align:start position:0%
generally try to fix that anywhere but
 
06:03:47.548 --> 06:03:47.558 align:start position:0%
it is certainly not pivotal but it is
 
06:03:49.548 --> 06:03:49.558 align:start position:0%
just more accurate at this moment we'll
 
06:03:53.990 --> 06:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
take that win thank you any any time
 
06:03:57.110 --> 06:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
really okay yes follow up thank follow
 
06:03:58.830 --> 06:03:58.840 align:start position:0%
up thank you thank I thought that was my
 
06:03:59.868 --> 06:03:59.878 align:start position:0%
understanding but I always like to have
 
06:04:02.230 --> 06:04:02.240 align:start position:0%
clarification so thank you for thank you
 
06:04:04.910 --> 06:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
for making this necessary yes
 
06:04:06.390 --> 06:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
representative Ray
 
06:04:08.230 --> 06:04:08.240 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman I do have a
 
06:04:11.110 --> 06:04:11.120 align:start position:0%
question about um striking the unique
 
06:04:12.548 --> 06:04:12.558 align:start position:0%
needs of the child because when I read
 
06:04:15.990 --> 06:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
it I honestly transgender issues like
 
06:04:18.430 --> 06:04:18.440 align:start position:0%
never even popped into my head when I
 
06:04:20.150 --> 06:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
read unique needs of the child I was
 
06:04:22.708 --> 06:04:22.718 align:start position:0%
thinking about a child who was deaf or
 
06:04:25.948 --> 06:04:25.958 align:start position:0%
blind or had some other serious medical
 
06:04:27.270 --> 06:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
condition perhaps they're in a
 
06:04:29.670 --> 06:04:29.680 align:start position:0%
wheelchair um I've worked with with kids
 
06:04:32.390 --> 06:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
with cerebal policy or you know muscular
 
06:04:35.390 --> 06:04:35.400 align:start position:0%
distrophy or other unique needs that
 
06:04:38.510 --> 06:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
would require specific assistance to a
 
06:04:40.230 --> 06:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
parent who has never parented a child
 
06:04:42.788 --> 06:04:42.798 align:start position:0%
with those needs like anything about
 
06:04:45.468 --> 06:04:45.478 align:start position:0%
gender none of that ever occurred to me
 
06:04:50.270 --> 06:04:50.280 align:start position:0%
so my concern is by striking that are we
 
06:04:53.310 --> 06:04:53.320 align:start position:0%
now eliminating the ability of a parent
 
06:04:55.708 --> 06:04:55.718 align:start position:0%
who has never parented a child with
 
06:04:58.190 --> 06:04:58.200 align:start position:0%
these types of needs from being able to
 
06:05:01.670 --> 06:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
access um services and help uh through
 
06:05:02.750 --> 06:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
the court
 
06:05:06.468 --> 06:05:06.478 align:start position:0%
system or from considering their ability
 
06:05:08.948 --> 06:05:08.958 align:start position:0%
to to ramp up on those needs before
 
06:05:11.350 --> 06:05:11.360 align:start position:0%
placing the kid with them I wouldn't
 
06:05:14.390 --> 06:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
think so no okay so I mean that's my
 
06:05:15.948 --> 06:05:15.958 align:start position:0%
concern I just I would hate to see a
 
06:05:17.830 --> 06:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
situation where we have we take a child
 
06:05:20.030 --> 06:05:20.040 align:start position:0%
who for example is deaf and put them
 
06:05:22.150 --> 06:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
with a a parent who doesn't know any
 
06:05:24.468 --> 06:05:24.478 align:start position:0%
sign language without without
 
06:05:25.910 --> 06:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
considering what the impact of that
 
06:05:25.920 --> 06:05:26.990 align:start position:0%
considering what the impact of that
would

06:05:26.990 --> 06:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
would
 
06:05:29.070 --> 06:05:29.080 align:start position:0%
be I I think they should be with that
 
06:05:30.830 --> 06:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
parent I just think that there should be
 
06:05:34.150 --> 06:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
Services yeah I I can't see that
 
06:05:36.628 --> 06:05:36.638 align:start position:0%
scenario taking place plus this language
 
06:05:39.948 --> 06:05:39.958 align:start position:0%
by the way is also in Statue
 
06:05:43.270 --> 06:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
presently what language I believe the
 
06:05:45.948 --> 06:05:45.958 align:start position:0%
language of the unique needs of the
 
06:05:49.190 --> 06:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
child I was told that it's not it was
 
06:05:51.708 --> 06:05:51.718 align:start position:0%
it's it came from Massachusetts statute
 
06:05:52.948 --> 06:05:52.958 align:start position:0%
which is why they were trying to add it
 
06:05:54.910 --> 06:05:54.920 align:start position:0%
to the New Hampshire statute and again I
 
06:05:56.948 --> 06:05:56.958 align:start position:0%
think it was designed specifically for
 
06:05:59.430 --> 06:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
kids with developmental delays or other
 
06:06:01.310 --> 06:06:01.320 align:start position:0%
you know medical or mental health issues
 
06:06:05.628 --> 06:06:05.638 align:start position:0%
that are not developmentally um not part
 
06:06:07.830 --> 06:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
of a normal developmental
 
06:06:11.510 --> 06:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
stage so I'm like super worried about us
 
06:06:13.670 --> 06:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
ending up in a situation again like the
 
06:06:15.948 --> 06:06:15.958 align:start position:0%
homy Montgomery case and the other child
 
06:06:18.350 --> 06:06:18.360 align:start position:0%
whose dad poured boiling water on him
 
06:06:20.868 --> 06:06:20.878 align:start position:0%
where the parent is not prepared for the
 
06:06:23.150 --> 06:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
needs of to meet the medical or
 
06:06:24.948 --> 06:06:24.958 align:start position:0%
emotional or behavioral needs of that
 
06:06:28.150 --> 06:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
child without help because that's it's
 
06:06:29.948 --> 06:06:29.958 align:start position:0%
just so stressful it's stressful to be
 
06:06:31.548 --> 06:06:31.558 align:start position:0%
in that when you have all the services I
 
06:06:32.868 --> 06:06:32.878 align:start position:0%
can't imagine how stressful it is if
 
06:06:35.070 --> 06:06:35.080 align:start position:0%
you've never experienced it before
 
06:06:35.080 --> 06:06:36.628 align:start position:0%
you've never experienced it before
represent

06:06:36.628 --> 06:06:36.638 align:start position:0%
represent
 
06:06:39.750 --> 06:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
ball thank you chairman Pearson I would
 
06:06:41.468 --> 06:06:41.478 align:start position:0%
think that then it would go to that next
 
06:06:42.948 --> 06:06:42.958 align:start position:0%
one where it says they're going to look
 
06:06:44.750 --> 06:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
at the existing and historical
 
06:06:46.590 --> 06:06:46.600 align:start position:0%
relationship so if there was no
 
06:06:46.600 --> 06:06:47.830 align:start position:0%
relationship so if there was no
historical

06:06:47.830 --> 06:06:47.840 align:start position:0%
historical
 
06:06:50.670 --> 06:06:50.680 align:start position:0%
relationship by virtue the the parent
 
06:06:52.230 --> 06:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
may not know how to work with those
 
06:06:54.910 --> 06:06:54.920 align:start position:0%
unique needs but if they have had that
 
06:07:02.750 --> 06:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:10.430 --> 06:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:13.750 --> 06:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative Perez yeah um I
 
06:07:16.270 --> 06:07:16.280 align:start position:0%
just want to say hopefully before we
 
06:07:19.830 --> 06:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
decided to vote for this bill we do care
 
06:07:22.788 --> 06:07:22.798 align:start position:0%
and and pay attention to that we we are
 
06:07:25.270 --> 06:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
here to protect the kids yes I do care
 
06:07:28.510 --> 06:07:28.520 align:start position:0%
about the parents but to be honest as a
 
06:07:31.030 --> 06:07:31.040 align:start position:0%
Survivor I do care what's happening to
 
06:07:33.390 --> 06:07:33.400 align:start position:0%
the kids and how do
 
06:07:35.990 --> 06:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
we what are we doing to protect then to
 
06:07:38.510 --> 06:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
make sure that you know um the things
 
06:07:40.590 --> 06:07:40.600 align:start position:0%
that we see happening lately is not
 
06:07:40.600 --> 06:07:41.590 align:start position:0%
that we see happening lately is not
happening

happening
 
06:07:44.350 --> 06:07:44.360 align:start position:0%
again the welfare of the child is the
 
06:07:46.270 --> 06:07:46.280 align:start position:0%
primary factor to be weighed when
 
06:07:48.270 --> 06:07:48.280 align:start position:0%
determining if a parent is fit to
 
06:07:50.150 --> 06:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
protect the child that's part of the
 
06:07:56.708 --> 06:07:56.718 align:start position:0%

06:11:49.670 --> 06:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
executive session on Senate Bill 417
 
06:11:56.030 --> 06:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
FN and I now open the exec session on
 
06:11:59.190 --> 06:11:59.200 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 463 expanding access to
 
06:12:01.708 --> 06:12:01.718 align:start position:0%
court appointed councel and you may
 
06:12:04.548 --> 06:12:04.558 align:start position:0%
remember Senator Carson there was a
 
06:12:11.230 --> 06:12:11.240 align:start position:0%
question before us that um uh what if
 
06:12:11.240 --> 06:12:12.868 align:start position:0%
question before us that um uh what if
the

06:12:12.868 --> 06:12:12.878 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:12:15.788 --> 06:12:15.798 align:start position:0%
Judiciary even a year from now does
 
06:12:18.670 --> 06:12:18.680 align:start position:0%
still not have enough
 
06:12:22.310 --> 06:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
judges uh to be able to assign a judge
 
06:12:26.030 --> 06:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
to a person of tender age needing
 
06:12:29.430 --> 06:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
such and so since this was anticipated
 
06:12:33.430 --> 06:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
as being an issue I have an amendment
 
06:12:36.230 --> 06:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
which would take out
 
06:12:39.230 --> 06:12:39.240 align:start position:0%
um some language and change things to
 
06:12:41.590 --> 06:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
say if no attorney is available the
 
06:12:43.788 --> 06:12:43.798 align:start position:0%
court May proceed without appointing an
 
06:12:46.110 --> 06:12:46.120 align:start position:0%
attorney for the
 
06:12:48.990 --> 06:12:49.000 align:start position:0%
child uh it is aspirational and I'm sure
 
06:12:50.868 --> 06:12:50.878 align:start position:0%
the court is working towards it but what
 
06:12:53.510 --> 06:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
if when the bill takes effect in July of
 
06:12:56.868 --> 06:12:56.878 align:start position:0%
next year there still are not enough
 
06:12:59.990 --> 06:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
judges the amendment to
 
06:13:03.150 --> 06:13:03.160 align:start position:0%
consider is that sentence if no attorney
 
06:13:06.070 --> 06:13:06.080 align:start position:0%
is available the court May do such and
 
06:13:09.150 --> 06:13:09.160 align:start position:0%
such and you are asking actually to see
 
06:13:13.548 --> 06:13:13.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:16.310 --> 06:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
you and so here's the amendment coming
 
06:13:21.590 --> 06:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
around the uh language in question is
 
06:13:23.990 --> 06:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
lines 67 and
 
06:13:27.070 --> 06:13:27.080 align:start position:0%
8 and down in line 24 the word
 
06:13:29.948 --> 06:13:29.958 align:start position:0%
guaranteed is removed and it simply
 
06:13:32.350 --> 06:13:32.360 align:start position:0%
reads now the right to attorney not the
 
06:13:35.628 --> 06:13:35.638 align:start position:0%
guaranteed right to attorney so this is
 
06:15:03.948 --> 06:15:03.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:52.270 --> 06:15:52.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:55.150 --> 06:15:55.160 align:start position:0%
so once again this is the only change
 
06:15:58.310 --> 06:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
that the amendment makes is line 67 six
 
06:16:00.948 --> 06:16:00.958 align:start position:0%
and 7 if no attorney is available the
 
06:16:02.590 --> 06:16:02.600 align:start position:0%
court May proceed without appointing an
 
06:16:05.150 --> 06:16:05.160 align:start position:0%
attorney in the field and L
 
06:16:05.160 --> 06:16:07.750 align:start position:0%
attorney in the field and L
[Music]

06:16:07.750 --> 06:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:16:11.910 --> 06:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
um 24 takes out the word guaranteed
 
06:16:13.628 --> 06:16:13.638 align:start position:0%
where it used to say the guaranteed
 
06:16:15.788 --> 06:16:15.798 align:start position:0%
right to an attorney now it says the
 
06:16:17.190 --> 06:16:17.200 align:start position:0%
right to an
 
06:16:20.788 --> 06:16:20.798 align:start position:0%
attorney so that is the difference on
 
06:16:20.798 --> 06:16:29.948 align:start position:0%
attorney so that is the difference on
the

06:16:29.948 --> 06:16:29.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:33.110 --> 06:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
amendment okay would somebody care to
 
06:16:36.430 --> 06:16:36.440 align:start position:0%

06:16:50.270 --> 06:16:50.280 align:start position:0%
seven well at the end of six and seven
 
06:16:51.548 --> 06:16:51.558 align:start position:0%

06:16:52.868 --> 06:16:52.878 align:start position:0%
court May proceed without appointing an
 
06:16:54.468 --> 06:16:54.478 align:start position:0%

06:17:51.430 --> 06:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
an attorney for the child so I'm
 
06:17:52.910 --> 06:17:52.920 align:start position:0%
envisioning a situation where there is
 
06:17:55.230 --> 06:17:55.240 align:start position:0%
an attorney immediately available we
 
06:17:57.270 --> 06:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
move forward what happens at the next
 
06:18:00.150 --> 06:18:00.160 align:start position:0%
hearing can is this that child never
 
06:18:02.708 --> 06:18:02.718 align:start position:0%
gets an attorney or at what point now
 
06:18:04.868 --> 06:18:04.878 align:start position:0%
can the child get an attorney well
 
06:18:07.590 --> 06:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
reading the language is a um liberal
 
06:18:10.548 --> 06:18:10.558 align:start position:0%
arts guy uh you can proceed I would
 
06:18:11.830 --> 06:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
assume that when an attorney is
 
06:18:14.390 --> 06:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
available that attorney is appointed but
 
06:18:15.868 --> 06:18:15.878 align:start position:0%
you're only proceeding when there isn't
 
06:18:17.788 --> 06:18:17.798 align:start position:0%
one available that would be my guess how
 
06:18:20.750 --> 06:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
would Judiciary understand that I just
 
06:18:21.948 --> 06:18:21.958 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that that we don't
 
06:18:23.990 --> 06:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
lose a trigger point oh I appreciate
 
06:18:27.510 --> 06:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:29.430 --> 06:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
attorney thank you ma'am I appreciate
 
06:18:31.750 --> 06:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
the question I I read it the same way
 
06:18:33.708 --> 06:18:33.718 align:start position:0%
which is proceeding is only while you're
 
06:18:35.510 --> 06:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
proceeding that the attorney is not
 
06:18:37.468 --> 06:18:37.478 align:start position:0%
available um there's always the
 
06:18:39.070 --> 06:18:39.080 align:start position:0%
discretion to appoint an attorney under
 
06:18:40.548 --> 06:18:40.558 align:start position:0%
this language it's it's been added that
 
06:18:42.590 --> 06:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
the court always can as well so if they
 
06:18:44.548 --> 06:18:44.558 align:start position:0%
learn that there's one available they
 
06:18:47.190 --> 06:18:47.200 align:start position:0%
can appoint them at any time but it's I
 
06:18:48.670 --> 06:18:48.680 align:start position:0%
think it's it's certainly complicated as
 
06:18:49.910 --> 06:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
you get pretty far and the proceeding if
 
06:18:51.350 --> 06:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
an attorney hasn't been available to the
 
06:18:53.390 --> 06:18:53.400 align:start position:0%
very end that there may be some some
 
06:18:56.350 --> 06:18:56.360 align:start position:0%
challenge there uh but the court has the
 
06:18:57.708 --> 06:18:57.718 align:start position:0%
discretion to add an attorney later if
 
06:18:59.910 --> 06:18:59.920 align:start position:0%
one becomes available under this
 
06:19:02.868 --> 06:19:02.878 align:start position:0%
language does that answer your question
 
06:19:05.190 --> 06:19:05.200 align:start position:0%
representative it does thank you you're
 
06:19:06.230 --> 06:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
welcome so on another hand
 
06:19:08.548 --> 06:19:08.558 align:start position:0%
representative Greg thank you Mr
 
06:19:11.030 --> 06:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
chairman um so we had a much more robust
 
06:19:14.548 --> 06:19:14.558 align:start position:0%
conversation about this one on HB uh 535
 
06:19:16.788 --> 06:19:16.798 align:start position:0%
on our very own bill uh that went out
 
06:19:18.430 --> 06:19:18.440 align:start position:0%
and I think that you know one of the
 
06:19:21.070 --> 06:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
things we talked about is that the
 
06:19:24.350 --> 06:19:24.360 align:start position:0%
amendment just basically took this bill
 
06:19:26.110 --> 06:19:26.120 align:start position:0%
you know out at the knees that we left
 
06:19:31.230 --> 06:19:31.240 align:start position:0%
in at um on our particular bill is
 
06:19:33.310 --> 06:19:33.320 align:start position:0%
giving it an out for them not to be able
 
06:19:36.670 --> 06:19:36.680 align:start position:0%
to get you know we won't we talked about
 
06:19:39.350 --> 06:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
in that executive session that we wanted
 
06:19:41.468 --> 06:19:41.478 align:start position:0%
to force the issue that they be able to
 
06:19:43.628 --> 06:19:43.638 align:start position:0%
get an attorney um instead we're just
 
06:19:46.150 --> 06:19:46.160 align:start position:0%
saying well but if there's not then you
 
06:19:49.190 --> 06:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
know go ahead and move on I think that
 
06:19:52.310 --> 06:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh necessity sometimes dictates stronger
 
06:19:54.868 --> 06:19:54.878 align:start position:0%
action I think that we have shown we
 
06:19:57.430 --> 06:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
have had very big discussions in this
 
06:20:00.110 --> 06:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
particular room about the necessity for
 
06:20:01.910 --> 06:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
children to have this and I worry that
 
06:20:04.270 --> 06:20:04.280 align:start position:0%
we just we took any power away with this
 
06:20:08.948 --> 06:20:08.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:12.910 --> 06:20:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:15.150 --> 06:20:15.160 align:start position:0%
else you know it goes to the old
 
06:20:15.160 --> 06:20:16.548 align:start position:0%
else you know it goes to the old
question

06:20:16.548 --> 06:20:16.558 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:20:19.868 --> 06:20:19.878 align:start position:0%
of do we lead with carrots or sticks and
 
06:20:24.110 --> 06:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
I can see the need for both and you know
 
06:20:26.310 --> 06:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
as a carrot kind of a guy generally I
 
06:20:27.948 --> 06:20:27.958 align:start position:0%
let people know I also know where the
 
06:20:31.270 --> 06:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
sticks are kept and one could argue if
 
06:20:33.270 --> 06:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
one argued and I'm neutral I just
 
06:20:34.708 --> 06:20:34.718 align:start position:0%
brought this in because some people
 
06:20:37.868 --> 06:20:37.878 align:start position:0%
wanted it uh I really don't yet know how
 
06:20:40.110 --> 06:20:40.120 align:start position:0%
I'm going to vote on this and I got to
 
06:20:42.750 --> 06:20:42.760 align:start position:0%
know that pretty soon but I could argue
 
06:20:44.430 --> 06:20:44.440 align:start position:0%
from the carrot point of view that this
 
06:20:47.350 --> 06:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
is highly aspirational Judiciary knows
 
06:20:49.030 --> 06:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
this is what we want
 
06:20:52.110 --> 06:20:52.120 align:start position:0%
Judiciary and if we don't sense that
 
06:20:54.830 --> 06:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
there's good faith forward progress
 
06:20:56.390 --> 06:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
being made next year we come with a
 
06:21:00.750 --> 06:21:00.760 align:start position:0%
stack we could say that um as a carrot
 
06:21:03.830 --> 06:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
guy I don't mind saying that we could
 
06:21:05.868 --> 06:21:05.878 align:start position:0%
also say my gosh the thing isn't going
 
06:21:08.390 --> 06:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
to kick in for what a year is
 
06:21:10.750 --> 06:21:10.760 align:start position:0%
it this bill isn't going to kick in for
 
06:21:12.830 --> 06:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
a year
 
06:21:17.548 --> 06:21:17.558 align:start position:0%
and H yeah so I mean golly uh there are
 
06:21:20.270 --> 06:21:20.280 align:start position:0%
lawyers who might want to be found
 
06:21:21.910 --> 06:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
within a year that we could argue it
 
06:21:23.990 --> 06:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
that way so I'm just putting the
 
06:21:25.548 --> 06:21:25.558 align:start position:0%
amendment out and I can see both sides
 
06:21:27.430 --> 06:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
of this but thank you for your point
 
06:21:32.948 --> 06:21:32.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:35.350 --> 06:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
in you like the Bill and you like the
 
06:21:37.948 --> 06:21:37.958 align:start position:0%
amendment so the last person I said are
 
06:21:40.948 --> 06:21:40.958 align:start position:0%
you ambivalent to said well yes and
 
06:21:45.990 --> 06:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
no go ahead yes thank you Mr chairman I
 
06:21:49.030 --> 06:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
I can see everybody's point my fear
 
06:21:52.628 --> 06:21:52.638 align:start position:0%
without the amendment is that a
 
06:21:57.230 --> 06:21:57.240 align:start position:0%
proceeding would be held up and a child
 
06:22:00.670 --> 06:22:00.680 align:start position:0%
a child's issues in the court would not
 
06:22:05.310 --> 06:22:05.320 align:start position:0%
proceed because there is not
 
06:22:07.628 --> 06:22:07.638 align:start position:0%
an attorney available and I would hate
 
06:22:09.150 --> 06:22:09.160 align:start position:0%
to see a
 
06:22:12.590 --> 06:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
child's issues not be addressed as soon
 
06:22:17.350 --> 06:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:20.948 --> 06:22:20.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:23.830 --> 06:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
else representative Greg for the kill
 
06:22:25.430 --> 06:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
all right just and on that flip side I
 
06:22:27.628 --> 06:22:27.638 align:start position:0%
mean I think that I obviously see the
 
06:22:29.830 --> 06:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
argument on both sides we rush we rush a
 
06:22:31.350 --> 06:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
child into something and they end up in
 
06:22:32.868 --> 06:22:32.878 align:start position:0%
a situation where they're in a lot of
 
06:22:35.190 --> 06:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
danger and that does a lot of stuff so
 
06:22:36.990 --> 06:22:37.000 align:start position:0%
there are there are points on either
 
06:22:40.430 --> 06:22:40.440 align:start position:0%
side it's just you know why have bills
 
06:22:41.868 --> 06:22:41.878 align:start position:0%
like this we really had a great
 
06:22:43.628 --> 06:22:43.638 align:start position:0%
discussion on our own house bill and
 
06:22:45.628 --> 06:22:45.638 align:start position:0%
decided that it was ready to move so why
 
06:22:47.510 --> 06:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
we're not moving in the same way with
 
06:22:49.628 --> 06:22:49.638 align:start position:0%
this one I'm just a little confused but
 
06:22:52.310 --> 06:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
I do see that but the rush to say okay
 
06:22:53.750 --> 06:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
well we can't get an attorney so we're
 
06:22:55.350 --> 06:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
going to give you half the amount of
 
06:22:56.788 --> 06:22:56.798 align:start position:0%
care you should have and you know we're
 
06:22:58.788 --> 06:22:58.798 align:start position:0%
going to rush you into a situation that
 
06:23:00.430 --> 06:23:00.440 align:start position:0%
maybe isn't the best for you because you
 
06:23:02.390 --> 06:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
don't have somebody to advocate for you
 
06:23:04.628 --> 06:23:04.638 align:start position:0%
these kiddos are not coming that are you
 
06:23:06.750 --> 06:23:06.760 align:start position:0%
know going to be able to articulate well
 
06:23:08.548 --> 06:23:08.558 align:start position:0%
that even have a lot of insight into
 
06:23:10.868 --> 06:23:10.878 align:start position:0%
their situation um you know it's
 
06:23:12.788 --> 06:23:12.798 align:start position:0%
important to have somebody there for
 
06:23:19.030 --> 06:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:22.030 --> 06:23:22.040 align:start position:0%
them that's
 
06:23:30.310 --> 06:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:33.670 --> 06:23:33.680 align:start position:0%
else representative ball thank you
 
06:23:35.948 --> 06:23:35.958 align:start position:0%
chairman peon so I'll just ask the
 
06:23:38.350 --> 06:23:38.360 align:start position:0%
question just for clarification further
 
06:23:40.430 --> 06:23:40.440 align:start position:0%
down it says that they have the right to
 
06:23:42.430 --> 06:23:42.440 align:start position:0%
the attorney so wouldn't they be able to
 
06:23:44.708 --> 06:23:44.718 align:start position:0%
say they don't want to proceed without
 
06:23:44.718 --> 06:23:47.230 align:start position:0%
say they don't want to proceed without
an

06:23:47.230 --> 06:23:47.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:50.190 --> 06:23:50.200 align:start position:0%
attorney the change on line 24 is the
 
06:23:53.948 --> 06:23:53.958 align:start position:0%
removal of the word the guaranteed right
 
06:23:55.670 --> 06:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
meaning let's say you have a right to do
 
06:23:57.948 --> 06:23:57.958 align:start position:0%
it and if garly if we had one would get
 
06:23:58.788 --> 06:23:58.798 align:start position:0%
it to
 
06:24:01.708 --> 06:24:01.718 align:start position:0%
you guaranteed right means you are going
 
06:24:03.750 --> 06:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
to have one right but I'm saying but
 
06:24:05.350 --> 06:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
this goes along with if it's not
 
06:24:06.948 --> 06:24:06.958 align:start position:0%
available but when you still have the
 
06:24:09.788 --> 06:24:09.798 align:start position:0%
right to say I prefer to hold off until
 
06:24:12.590 --> 06:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
there is a paternity would a child be
 
06:24:15.230 --> 06:24:15.240 align:start position:0%
wise enough to say that well some of the
 
06:24:17.670 --> 06:24:17.680 align:start position:0%
older ones are they in their Bill of
 
06:24:19.230 --> 06:24:19.240 align:start position:0%
Rights I don't know I'm just throwing it
 
06:24:21.830 --> 06:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
out there as The Devil's Advocate that
 
06:24:24.788 --> 06:24:24.798 align:start position:0%
isn't there a way to stop you know that
 
06:24:24.798 --> 06:24:26.110 align:start position:0%
isn't there a way to stop you know that
we

06:24:26.110 --> 06:24:26.120 align:start position:0%
we
 
06:24:29.468 --> 06:24:29.478 align:start position:0%
don't Mr chairman representative D money
 
06:24:30.948 --> 06:24:30.958 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I think what
 
06:24:34.990 --> 06:24:35.000 align:start position:0%
representative ball is pointing out is
 
06:24:38.070 --> 06:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
uh further down in the Bill of Rights
 
06:24:43.990 --> 06:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
um it it Roman numeral was it 14a says
 
06:24:46.708 --> 06:24:46.718 align:start position:0%
of the original Bill no on in this
 
06:24:50.430 --> 06:24:50.440 align:start position:0%
amendment in the amendment okay on line
 
06:24:53.548 --> 06:24:53.558 align:start position:0%
23 it says they have the right to be
 
06:24:56.310 --> 06:24:56.320 align:start position:0%
informed of the right to request an
 
06:25:01.070 --> 06:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
attorney under RSA 169 C10 Roman 2
 
06:25:05.270 --> 06:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
lowercase a and of of the right to an
 
06:25:09.350 --> 06:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
attorney under blah blah blah blah in
 
06:25:09.360 --> 06:25:10.548 align:start position:0%
attorney under blah blah blah blah in
certain

06:25:10.548 --> 06:25:10.558 align:start position:0%
certain
 
06:25:13.430 --> 06:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
circumstances the department shall
 
06:25:15.868 --> 06:25:15.878 align:start position:0%
provide the child with a written
 
06:25:19.110 --> 06:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
statement of these rights and process by
 
06:25:23.830 --> 06:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
which to request an attorney so if the
 
06:25:27.070 --> 06:25:27.080 align:start position:0%
child we were talking about was before
 
06:25:29.948 --> 06:25:29.958 align:start position:0%
the court and there was no attorney
 
06:25:32.670 --> 06:25:32.680 align:start position:0%
available at that time the child can
 
06:25:36.070 --> 06:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
still request an attorney and at that
 
06:25:39.670 --> 06:25:39.680 align:start position:0%
point this my guess is and we can ask
 
06:25:41.788 --> 06:25:41.798 align:start position:0%
Judiciary that the proceedings would
 
06:25:44.750 --> 06:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
then cease until the an attorney was
 
06:25:48.070 --> 06:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
available attorney KGAN that's a
 
06:25:50.350 --> 06:25:50.360 align:start position:0%
question that is not policy it's
 
06:25:55.150 --> 06:25:55.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:57.510 --> 06:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
judiciary would that be true that the
 
06:25:59.830 --> 06:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
proceedings woulds until an attorney
 
06:25:59.840 --> 06:26:00.948 align:start position:0%
proceedings woulds until an attorney
could

06:26:00.948 --> 06:26:00.958 align:start position:0%
could
 
06:26:07.270 --> 06:26:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:08.948 --> 06:26:08.958 align:start position:0%
Amendment are you looking at the
 
06:26:10.670 --> 06:26:10.680 align:start position:0%
amendment or the original Bill no sorry
 
06:26:11.868 --> 06:26:11.878 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the original bill just to
 
06:26:17.990 --> 06:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:20.628 --> 06:26:20.638 align:start position:0%
um I'm not certain if if the proceedings
 
06:26:23.350 --> 06:26:23.360 align:start position:0%
would entirely uh cease there could be a
 
06:26:25.468 --> 06:26:25.478 align:start position:0%
delay as they tried to locate someone
 
06:26:27.390 --> 06:26:27.400 align:start position:0%
but I think you there's still statutory
 
06:26:28.628 --> 06:26:28.638 align:start position:0%
timelines for some of the underlying
 
06:26:31.510 --> 06:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
proceedings so it's it's not a complete
 
06:26:33.990 --> 06:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
halt but but certainly to to try to
 
06:26:37.110 --> 06:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:39.788 --> 06:26:39.798 align:start position:0%
request that answer your question yes it
 
06:26:49.628 --> 06:26:49.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:53.190 --> 06:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
else Ty representative sidel so on the
 
06:26:54.628 --> 06:26:54.638 align:start position:0%
original bill now I've I'm all
 
06:26:56.270 --> 06:26:56.280 align:start position:0%
discombobulated um sorry I can't hear
 
06:26:58.910 --> 06:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
you over the background chatter go ahead
 
06:27:00.990 --> 06:27:01.000 align:start position:0%
on the original bill and I I was looking
 
06:27:02.230 --> 06:27:02.240 align:start position:0%
through something else and now I've lost
 
06:27:04.708 --> 06:27:04.718 align:start position:0%
it um thank you the
 
06:27:06.030 --> 06:27:06.040 align:start position:0%
actually we'll go to the amendment for
 
06:27:08.670 --> 06:27:08.680 align:start position:0%
line 24 where it's talking about the um
 
06:27:12.868 --> 06:27:12.878 align:start position:0%
guaranteed removed rights yes um in
 
06:27:14.750 --> 06:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
certain circumstances was added that
 
06:27:17.270 --> 06:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
that was not in the bill what certain
 
06:27:20.628 --> 06:27:20.638 align:start position:0%
circumstances would that mean that a
 
06:27:22.708 --> 06:27:22.718 align:start position:0%
child has got the right to an
 
06:27:25.310 --> 06:27:25.320 align:start position:0%
attorney I did not ask for that to be
 
06:27:28.788 --> 06:27:28.798 align:start position:0%

one way or the other with the Amendments
 
06:32:26.990 --> 06:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
because the guts of the amendment is
 
06:32:29.190 --> 06:32:29.200 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
06:32:32.230 --> 06:32:32.240 align:start position:0%
the uh lawyer for the

child must be be done or we're really
 
06:32:37.110 --> 06:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
going to try hard to do it but if we
 
06:32:39.548 --> 06:32:39.558 align:start position:0%
can't do it tough uh that's really what
 
06:32:42.310 --> 06:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
the amendment is about uh I don't think
 
06:32:44.830 --> 06:32:44.840 align:start position:0%
it's unpacking
 
06:32:47.788 --> 06:32:47.798 align:start position:0%
c102b uh I like what the law book has
 
06:32:50.750 --> 06:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
but the next addition doesn't have it
 
06:32:53.548 --> 06:32:53.558 align:start position:0%
and I don't know why and that could be a
 
06:32:56.030 --> 06:32:56.040 align:start position:0%
floor Amendment if somebody so wishes at
 
06:32:56.040 --> 06:32:56.830 align:start position:0%

uh uh there has been
 
06:36:41.040 --> 06:36:42.750 align:start position:0%
uh uh there has been
a

06:36:42.750 --> 06:36:42.760 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:36:45.628 --> 06:36:45.638 align:start position:0%
desire that
 
06:36:48.670 --> 06:36:48.680 align:start position:0%
498 is
 
06:36:51.350 --> 06:36:51.360 align:start position:0%
recommitted to
 
06:36:54.788 --> 06:36:54.798 align:start position:0%
us and I really am not in favor of
 
06:37:00.230 --> 06:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
that um I I think that is a good bill we
 
06:37:02.388 --> 06:37:02.398 align:start position:0%
got it out of here
 
06:37:05.830 --> 06:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
unanimously uh um we have adopted a
 
06:37:08.430 --> 06:37:08.440 align:start position:0%
definition of fictive which was one of
 
06:37:11.990 --> 06:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
the concerns the person wishing to move
 
06:37:14.350 --> 06:37:14.360 align:start position:0%
recommittal and
 
06:37:18.868 --> 06:37:18.878 align:start position:0%
raised uh I think any further churning
 
06:37:22.910 --> 06:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
on who may or may not be uh to me could
 
06:37:25.270 --> 06:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
have some unintended
 
06:37:28.750 --> 06:37:28.760 align:start position:0%
consequences and the session that we
 
06:37:32.230 --> 06:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
will be voting on on this is not this
 
06:37:34.350 --> 06:37:34.360 align:start position:0%
Thursday but it is in
 
06:37:35.948 --> 06:37:35.958 align:start position:0%
and our work should have been done by
 
06:37:39.270 --> 06:37:39.280 align:start position:0%
then and I am not in a mood to come back
 
06:37:42.310 --> 06:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
just to deal with this being recommitted
 
06:37:45.388 --> 06:37:45.398 align:start position:0%
so uh this is not an official vote but
 
06:37:50.430 --> 06:37:50.440 align:start position:0%
could I have a a show of thumb as to who
 
06:37:52.788 --> 06:37:52.798 align:start position:0%
wants this to be recommitted so we can
 
06:37:54.430 --> 06:37:54.440 align:start position:0%
work on
 
06:37:54.440 --> 06:37:56.110 align:start position:0%
work on
it

06:37:56.110 --> 06:37:56.120 align:start position:0%
