for you to comment on things you might
 
00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:42.560 align:start position:0%

make comments about the districts as
well

00:14:46.389 --> 00:14:46.399 align:start position:0%

that wishes to speak
 
00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
and uh so the side note from the
 
00:14:58.949 --> 00:14:58.959 align:start position:0%
prepared thing what we're really looking
 
00:15:00.389 --> 00:15:00.399 align:start position:0%
for and why we're going out to all the
 
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
counties is
 
00:15:03.829 --> 00:15:03.839 align:start position:0%
data that's hard to collect
 
00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
what's working for you with what you
 
00:15:07.189 --> 00:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
have now what's not working what do you
 
00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
wish to be left alone or change or it's
 
00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:12.240 align:start position:0%
impossible to drive from this town to
 
00:15:13.509 --> 00:15:13.519 align:start position:0%
that town
 
00:15:15.509 --> 00:15:15.519 align:start position:0%
without locking your hubs in and going
 
00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
on a crazy dirt road things like that
 
00:15:19.829 --> 00:15:19.839 align:start position:0%
that's just not information we can get
 
00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:24.240 align:start position:0%
so with that
 
00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:45.440 align:start position:0%

00:16:38.069 --> 00:16:38.079 align:start position:0%
and executive council district 2 which
 
00:16:40.069 --> 00:16:40.079 align:start position:0%
come into sullivan county
 
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
result in unequal representation and
 
00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
represent a partisan priority
 
00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
that needs to be addressed
 
00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
however tonight
 
00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
i'm speaking about the sullivan county
 
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
house districts
 
00:16:54.629 --> 00:16:54.639 align:start position:0%
i believe
 
00:16:57.829 --> 00:16:57.839 align:start position:0%
strongly in fair redistricting maps and
 
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:04.079 align:start position:0%
i supported an independent redistricting
 
00:17:04.079 --> 00:17:05.029 align:start position:0%
i supported an independent redistricting
committee

00:17:05.029 --> 00:17:05.039 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:17:08.949 --> 00:17:08.959 align:start position:0%

districts
 
00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
the goal of fair redistricting should be
 
00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
equal population among the various
 
00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:10.000 align:start position:0%

00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
citizen
 
00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
for representation in the new hampshire
 
00:18:16.789 --> 00:18:16.799 align:start position:0%
house is approximately equal
 
00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
to that of any other citizen with a

slight five percent deviation
 
00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
ontario districts are complicated and
 
00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:26.630 align:start position:0%
ontario districts are complicated and
confusing

00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
confusing
 
00:18:30.549 --> 00:18:30.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
eight towns in my case
 
00:18:34.549 --> 00:18:34.559 align:start position:0%
with vastly different populations
 
00:18:37.029 --> 00:18:37.039 align:start position:0%
connections and economies
 
00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
the fact that a town or two towns have
 
00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
one representative from their area as
 
00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:44.240 align:start position:0%
well as one floating over them
 
00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
gives the impression that they have two
 
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
or three representatives in the house
 
00:18:50.549 --> 00:18:50.559 align:start position:0%
and that is misleading
 
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
it treats these towns as if they had a
 
00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
two or three member district which they
 
00:18:57.669 --> 00:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
do not
 
00:18:59.350 --> 00:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
moterial districts pose several
 
00:19:01.909 --> 00:19:01.919 align:start position:0%
disadvantages to voters as well
 
00:19:03.909 --> 00:19:03.919 align:start position:0%
the average citizen doesn't know what a
 
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
plutarial district is take it from me
 
00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
had that question many times
 
00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
what it accomplishes or why it exists
 
00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
voters are less likely to know their
 
00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
district representative because the
 
00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
proterial district covers such a large
 
00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:20.789 align:start position:0%
proterial district covers such a large
area

00:19:20.789 --> 00:19:20.799 align:start position:0%
area
 
00:19:22.789 --> 00:19:22.799 align:start position:0%
the proterial district representatives
 
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
are not part of the everyday
 
00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
interactions and connections in the
 
00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:28.720 align:start position:0%
individual communities
 
00:19:29.909 --> 00:19:29.919 align:start position:0%
for example
 
00:19:33.029 --> 00:19:33.039 align:start position:0%
two ends of my district plainfield
 
00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:35.200 align:start position:0%
is much different from the other end
 
00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.470 align:start position:0%
is much different from the other end
unity

00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:36.480 align:start position:0%

plainfield has a population of 2459

claremont
 
00:19:57.510 --> 00:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
when voting on an issue that arises in

the house
 
00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
with eight towns it's very difficult to
 
00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
represent all their local government
 
00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
schools and economies fairly
 
00:20:09.029 --> 00:20:09.039 align:start position:0%
in the 2002
 
00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
court case berlin versus chandler the
 
00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
court rejected clotarial districts as an
 
00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
unsound redistricting device
 
00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:20.240 align:start position:0%
we are a representative democracy
 
00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
whenever possible districting should
 
00:20:24.789 --> 00:20:24.799 align:start position:0%
produce one person for one vote
 
00:20:26.549 --> 00:20:26.559 align:start position:0%
districts should be drawn so that every
 
00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
voter has the same equal representation
 
00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
as every other voter
 
00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
this is accomplished by creating as many
 
00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
single districts as possible
 
00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
i urge you to consider single districts
 
00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:40.480 align:start position:0%

in newport with 6299
 
00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
for a two-person representative district
 
00:20:59.510 --> 00:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
further i would urge the committee to
 
00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
set multi-district towns multi-towns and
 
00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
districts with a priority to their
 
00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
economic and governmental connections
 
00:21:11.029 --> 00:21:11.039 align:start position:0%
and please eliminate the plotarios
 
00:21:13.669 --> 00:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:16.400 align:start position:0%

long-time president
 
00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:02.480 align:start position:0%
to suggest the redistricting committee
 
00:22:05.029 --> 00:22:05.039 align:start position:0%
follow the new hampshire constitution
 
00:22:07.669 --> 00:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
and restore son of youth status as a
 
00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
single district
 
00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
based on the 2000 census sanofi became a
 
00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
single district a status that many of
 
00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
the town's citizens had worked hard to
 
00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:19.350 align:start position:0%
the town's citizens had worked hard to
achieve

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
achieve
 
00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
and valued highly
 
00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
however during the 2010
 
00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
redistricting process sanofi lost its
 
00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
standing as a single district even
 
00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:32.480 align:start position:0%
though its population was about as close
 
00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
as it could get to the perfect number
 
00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
sonically found itself alive with a town
 
00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
with whom it shared virtually no common
 
00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:42.710 align:start position:0%
with whom it shared virtually no common
interest

00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
interest
 
00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
and as well it was enrolled in the
 
00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
eighth birthday town ontario district
 
00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:51.200 align:start position:0%
you just heard uh described by

you just heard uh described by

00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:58.230 --> 00:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
it felt like a gerrymandered decision
 
00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
hoping to tilt the political winds
 
00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:03.280 align:start position:0%
and the ballot results in a certain
 
00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:04.390 align:start position:0%
and the ballot results in a certain
direction

00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:04.400 align:start position:0%
direction
 
00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
it did not feel as if the constitutional
 
00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:08.470 align:start position:0%
it did not feel as if the constitutional
requirement

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:10.240 align:start position:0%
was being followed
 
00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
as of now sonoff is again easily within
 
00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
the five percent standard
 
00:23:18.549 --> 00:23:18.559 align:start position:0%
are the town citizens once again
 
00:23:22.549 --> 00:23:22.559 align:start position:0%
going to feel as if that constitutional
 
00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:26.720 align:start position:0%
is always dangling just out of reach
 
00:23:29.909 --> 00:23:29.919 align:start position:0%
and i would say the same is true for uh
 
00:23:31.909 --> 00:23:31.919 align:start position:0%
newport because they've had the same
 
00:23:31.919 --> 00:23:33.990 align:start position:0%
newport because they've had the same
experience

00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
experience
 
00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
if in your wisdom the interim maps or
 
00:23:41.029 --> 00:23:41.039 align:start position:0%
map that you design keeps the centipede
 
00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:44.240 align:start position:0%
connected to one two or even eight towns
 
00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:46.720 align:start position:0%
would you try to give us a partner with
 
00:23:49.909 --> 00:23:49.919 align:start position:0%
whom we share common interests and i
 
00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
would suggest that the town of
 
00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
springfield would be
 
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
useful we have a contractual agreement
 
00:23:59.269 --> 00:23:59.279 align:start position:0%
to use the transfer station
 
00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
and because the towns also share a
 
00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
watershed many citizens participate
 
00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
enjoying efforts to maintain the
 
00:24:10.549 --> 00:24:10.559 align:start position:0%
national resources of our area
 
00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
so good luck on your job and i hope you
 
00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:42.549 --> 00:24:42.559 align:start position:0%
my name is brian sullivan representative
 
00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:45.200 align:start position:0%
uh from sullivan district one
 
00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
representing cornish plainfield grantham
 
00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
and uh springfield
 
00:24:52.789 --> 00:24:52.799 align:start position:0%
and uh first of all i'd like to say a
 
00:24:54.549 --> 00:24:54.559 align:start position:0%
little to everything rep tanner had to
 
00:24:54.559 --> 00:24:55.269 align:start position:0%
little to everything rep tanner had to
say

00:24:55.269 --> 00:24:55.279 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
um i think this materials are very
 
00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:58.710 align:start position:0%
um i think this materials are very
confusing

00:24:58.710 --> 00:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
confusing
 
00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
very good people in the four towns i
 
00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
represent actually know that they have
 
00:25:05.269 --> 00:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
three representatives um
 
00:25:07.669 --> 00:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
who represent them um
 
00:25:10.549 --> 00:25:10.559 align:start position:0%
they know generally about the oxfam um
 
00:25:13.029 --> 00:25:13.039 align:start position:0%
playing field and myself but not so much
 
00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
about uh representative tanner because
 
00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
she's spread the event
 
00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
um i would also say that when it comes
 
00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:22.240 align:start position:0%
to getting out and meeting people
 
00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
it's far easier for
 
00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
someone with one or two towns to get out
 
00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
and meet the voters which is what
 
00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
nature's all about um than someone with
 
00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
eight towns um so um i would strongly
 
00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:38.480 align:start position:0%
encourage you to uh give bill say
 
00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
another thought um
 
00:25:42.789 --> 00:25:42.799 align:start position:0%
speaking more specifically about uh
 
00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:45.200 align:start position:0%
sullivan district one um
 
00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:46.470 align:start position:0%
sullivan district one um
uh

00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
mr chairman you uh referenced um
 
00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:52.720 align:start position:0%
uh four-wheel drive tracks um
 
00:26:00.370 --> 00:26:00.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:07.990 align:start position:0%

00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
playing field uh i thoroughly enjoyed
 
00:26:13.269 --> 00:26:13.279 align:start position:0%
providing the back roads those two towns
 
00:26:13.279 --> 00:26:14.070 align:start position:0%
providing the back roads those two towns
um

00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
um with their lovely places
 
00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
but they are very separated from
 
00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
but they are very separated from
springfield

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:20.090 align:start position:0%
springfield
 
00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:22.149 align:start position:0%

[Music]

00:26:22.149 --> 00:26:22.159 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
and literally um i used to um
 
00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
periodically have somebody stopping when
 
00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
i was out in the neighborhood
 
00:26:31.909 --> 00:26:31.919 align:start position:0%
with an old farms and people would uh
 
00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
pull over and say um
 
00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
and their gps sent them into my
 
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:44.320 align:start position:0%
neighborhood thinking they were going to
 
00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
turnpike many times you can't really get
 
00:26:55.029 --> 00:26:55.039 align:start position:0%
through with a
 
00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
four-wheel drive unless you're going to
 
00:26:58.789 --> 00:26:58.799 align:start position:0%
do some serious damage
 
00:26:58.799 --> 00:27:01.990 align:start position:0%
do some serious damage
so

00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of ways to
 
00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:08.240 align:start position:0%
cut up this pie um i would suggest that
 
00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh it would make sense to have two
 
00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
districts um
 
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
one of them being
 
00:27:15.909 --> 00:27:15.919 align:start position:0%
cornish another one being uh grantham
 
00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
and springfield um if you want to
 
00:27:22.149 --> 00:27:22.159 align:start position:0%
representative godwin's dreams come true
 
00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
uh grantham and um
 
00:27:25.029 --> 00:27:25.039 align:start position:0%
could be
 
00:27:25.039 --> 00:27:26.070 align:start position:0%
could be
a

00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:27.440 align:start position:0%
district perhaps
 
00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:29.200 align:start position:0%
um but uh
 
00:27:34.149 --> 00:27:34.159 align:start position:0%
they do need to be joining each other um
 
00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
grantham and plainfield are um
 
00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
when you look at the map the big black
 
00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
blob at the top looks like it's very
 
00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
much a drain
 
00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:43.250 align:start position:0%
much a drain
but

00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:43.260 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:45.110 align:start position:0%
but
[Music]

00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
one of the things that is joining it is
 
00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
a big game
 
00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
um which
 
00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
gets fenced in you don't go there i
 
00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:59.350 --> 00:27:59.360 align:start position:0%
but yeah but basically it's that game
 
00:28:01.029 --> 00:28:01.039 align:start position:0%
preserve that really gives us a lot of
 
00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
our common uh geographical territory
 
00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:06.320 align:start position:0%
nobody holds that
 
00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:07.830 align:start position:0%
nobody holds that
so

00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
those are my thoughts again thank you
 
00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
for coming and
 
00:28:14.389 --> 00:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:17.269 --> 00:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
thank you

dedicating to increasing voter crown and

i trust and hope that you're here today
 
00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:29.120 align:start position:0%

and we've been traveling around the

00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
to listen and act upon our concerns
 
00:29:35.909 --> 00:29:35.919 align:start position:0%
and that this is just not
 
00:29:35.919 --> 00:29:55.430 align:start position:0%
and that this is just not
um

00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:57.909 --> 00:29:57.919 align:start position:0%
it's important that you ensure
 
00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
that this redistricting process is
 
00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.510 align:start position:0%
that this redistricting process is
transparent

00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
transparent
 
00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
inclusive and fair
 
00:30:05.269 --> 00:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
so that you get your residents like
 
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
this university whether or not you join
 
00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:39.350 align:start position:0%
this university whether or not you join
together

00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:30:43.269 --> 00:30:43.279 align:start position:0%
we just usually have college interests
 
00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
questions to ask to the rest of the
 
00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
i've lived in southern county since 1981
 
00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
turned from parker's age
 
00:31:13.909 --> 00:31:13.919 align:start position:0%
i thought about
 
00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
living in the hampshire kind of changed
 
00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
over time
 
00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
when i first came here as a 25 year old
 
00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
i was kind of annoying when people
 
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:25.509 --> 00:31:25.519 align:start position:0%
over time
 
00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
i became
 
00:31:44.789 --> 00:31:44.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:44.799 --> 00:32:08.470 align:start position:0%
 
to

00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:34.870 align:start position:0%
 
is

00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:55.190 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:57.029 --> 00:32:57.039 align:start position:0%
that it sounds like fear
 
00:32:59.590 --> 00:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
but it sounds like
 
00:33:03.269 --> 00:33:03.279 align:start position:0%
it's personally impossible and i think
 
00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:04.640 align:start position:0%
it was
 
00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
let's explain
 
00:33:07.669 --> 00:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
she had representing people the
 
00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:36.480 --> 00:34:47.589 align:start position:0%
 
somebody

00:34:47.589 --> 00:34:47.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
that allows
 
00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:51.200 align:start position:0%
those people to share some kind of
 
00:34:53.349 --> 00:34:53.359 align:start position:0%
interests i also
 
00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:00.069 --> 00:35:00.079 align:start position:0%
about this idea i've always wondered why
 
00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
she's one of my reps now i understand
 
00:35:03.109 --> 00:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
why i
 
00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
never made any sense
 
00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:06.640 align:start position:0%
and i actually
 
00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
would be better served
 
00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
by not having
 
00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
multiple reps in these small towns but
 
00:35:17.109 --> 00:35:17.119 align:start position:0%
instead having one round that represents
 
00:35:22.069 --> 00:35:22.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
all right the last thing i want to talk
 
00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:26.720 align:start position:0%
about is the capital council
 
00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:44.490 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:44.490 --> 00:36:00.310 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:02.320 align:start position:0%
this is a clear example
 
00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
unfortunately of excessive partisanship
 
00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:06.400 align:start position:0%
and we just
 
00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
american district 2
 
00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:09.910 align:start position:0%
american district 2
allowed

00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
allowed
 
00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:12.640 align:start position:0%
republican aggregate manufacturers and
 
00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:21.109 --> 00:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:23.440 align:start position:0%
this is classic charity
 
00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
your concerns
 
00:36:43.589 --> 00:36:43.599 align:start position:0%
to complete your job
 
00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
you'll need to return to self-accounting
 
00:36:48.069 --> 00:36:48.079 align:start position:0%
after the proposed new maps have been
 
00:36:48.079 --> 00:36:49.510 align:start position:0%
after the proposed new maps have been
created

00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
created
 
00:36:52.069 --> 00:36:52.079 align:start position:0%
through transparency and verification
 
00:36:54.310 --> 00:36:54.320 align:start position:0%
process requires
 
00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
the public to have the opportunity to be
 
00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:57.750 align:start position:0%
the public to have the opportunity to be
here

00:36:57.750 --> 00:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
and confidence on the opponent's maps
 
00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
before we decision is fine
 
00:37:05.589 --> 00:37:05.599 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
might interest you to know the
 
00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
representatives that have known me for
 
00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
years but from other parts of the state
 
00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
always ask me so what's it like up in
 
00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
the north country like dude i have no
 
00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:37.349 --> 00:37:37.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman members committee
 
00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
i think maybe i'm going to take my mask
 
00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
off to make sure that it's picked up
 
00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
properly i think i'm far enough away
 
00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
okay again i'm representing john clutier
 
00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
from sullivan county district 10. i sort
 
00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
of have to represent the entire city of
 
00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:51.829 align:start position:0%
of have to represent the entire city of
claremont

00:37:51.829 --> 00:37:51.839 align:start position:0%
claremont
 
00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
and i first want to say although i'm
 
00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
most interested in
 
00:37:57.589 --> 00:37:57.599 align:start position:0%
the house districts i also want to take
 
00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
time to urge the committee to do a fair
 
00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
and impartial redistricting job for our
 
00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
state senate districts our executive
 
00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
council districts our county
 
00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
commissioner districts as well as our
 
00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:10.720 align:start position:0%
u.s congressional districts
 
00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
these are just as important
 
00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
uh to a lot of people
 
00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
uh so that's i i know you have a very
 
00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:18.640 align:start position:0%
difficult job
 
00:38:20.310 --> 00:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
with all due respect to a previous
 
00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
committee some of the districts and not
 
00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:24.160 align:start position:0%
so much the rep some of the executive
 
00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:26.240 align:start position:0%
councils state senators
 
00:38:27.829 --> 00:38:27.839 align:start position:0%
they were a little bit strange to make
 
00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:30.800 align:start position:0%
uh put it that way that's my opinion
 
00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
but i do want to speak also about the
 
00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:34.480 align:start position:0%
house redistricting
 
00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
and i've been around a while i've
 
00:38:37.430 --> 00:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
actually been involved in two
 
00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:40.240 align:start position:0%
redistricting efforts
 
00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
and uh the first one and i by the way
 
00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:44.720 align:start position:0%
when i first selected i represent just
 
00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:50.870 align:start position:0%
when i first selected i represent just
one

00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:53.349 --> 00:38:53.359 align:start position:0%
2000 census we had a
 
00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
redistricting battle between the
 
00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
democratic governor republican
 
00:38:58.150 --> 00:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
legislature and in the end there was an
 
00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
impasse and a judicial master from south
 
00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
carolina i believe had to draw the
 
00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
legislative district we didn't complete
 
00:39:07.829 --> 00:39:07.839 align:start position:0%
it until the end of july 2002
 
00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
we had to push off the filing date for
 
00:39:11.829 --> 00:39:11.839 align:start position:0%
the primary and i remember that very
 
00:39:15.349 --> 00:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
well we had it was a very hectic time
 
00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
and we
 
00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
what ended up it may have been a fair
 
00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
process and maybe every most everybody
 
00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
in the state was satisfied but in my
 
00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:24.320 align:start position:0%
case i went from representing one
 
00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
district award in claremont to
 
00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:34.120 align:start position:0%
 
[Applause]

00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:34.130 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:34.130 --> 00:39:41.109 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:39:41.109 --> 00:39:41.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
only one available
 
00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:44.320 align:start position:0%
in 10 years we had that district from
 
00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:48.400 align:start position:0%
2002 to 2012 that we elected a candidate
 
00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:50.240 align:start position:0%
from outside claremont the claremont
 
00:39:52.069 --> 00:39:52.079 align:start position:0%
candidates whether they were democrats
 
00:39:56.069 --> 00:39:56.079 align:start position:0%
or republicans always got away
 
00:39:58.150 --> 00:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
when i went to those i did the best you
 
00:39:59.510 --> 00:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
know of course i'm from a city and i'm a
 
00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
city guy and so it took me a while to
 
00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
you know town government was a good
 
00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
experience i went to some of the town
 
00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
meetings with both communities school
 
00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
meetings got to know some of the people
 
00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
and that was one of their complaints
 
00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:10.950 align:start position:0%
and that was one of their complaints
constantly

00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
constantly
 
00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
you know they we don't like this system
 
00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
with all their respect for you
 
00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
representing we know you're your
 
00:40:17.829 --> 00:40:17.839 align:start position:0%
representative but we think we ought to
 
00:40:19.829 --> 00:40:19.839 align:start position:0%
have some more equity in us
 
00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
and all you know not just have claire
 
00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
monitors dominate us in the new
 
00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire house of representatives at
 
00:40:27.109 --> 00:40:27.119 align:start position:0%
least we ought to have a say so i think
 
00:40:29.349 --> 00:40:29.359 align:start position:0%
we ought to i urge this committee to try
 
00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
to create as smaller districts as
 
00:40:34.069 --> 00:40:34.079 align:start position:0%
possible and give some of our smaller
 
00:40:35.990 --> 00:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
communities a voice in the new hampshire
 
00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:38.720 align:start position:0%
house and i think somebody my colleagues
 
00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned some examples
 
00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
and i realized that it's partly based on
 
00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:44.550 align:start position:0%
and i realized that it's partly based on
population

00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
population
 
00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
but i feel that it needs to be fair
 
00:40:49.109 --> 00:40:49.119 align:start position:0%
if we can pile up and get four seats
 
00:40:50.829 --> 00:40:50.839 align:start position:0%
again that's fine
 
00:40:53.829 --> 00:40:53.839 align:start position:0%
uh but i think that i'm also concerned
 
00:40:55.270 --> 00:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
as chair of the sullivan county
 
00:40:57.270 --> 00:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
delegation about these other small
 
00:40:59.910 --> 00:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
communities in sullivan county as well
 
00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
they've combined some of them
 
00:41:03.349 --> 00:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
if you have to combine some of them
 
00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
based on the census you ought to look
 
00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
for areas of common
 
00:41:09.589 --> 00:41:09.599 align:start position:0%
concern for example and claremont's a
 
00:41:12.309 --> 00:41:12.319 align:start position:0%
good by itself i think another one a
 
00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
good case to be made is made for one rep
 
00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:16.720 align:start position:0%
is is cornish and playing field they
 
00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
have their own sau now so maybe they'll
 
00:41:20.230 --> 00:41:20.240 align:start position:0%
at least at least get a rep because
 
00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of history between those
 
00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
two communities
 
00:41:26.309 --> 00:41:26.319 align:start position:0%
and maybe webster and goshen for example
 
00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:28.480 align:start position:0%
another history i used to play with
 
00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
joint school district i'm just giving
 
00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
you some examples i don't mean to
 
00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
dictate but i think you ought to look
 
00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
for that what some of these community
 
00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
towns have in common some towns don't
 
00:41:38.950 --> 00:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
have as much in common
 
00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
so i urge this uh committee to do that
 
00:41:43.589 --> 00:41:43.599 align:start position:0%
uh and i'm hoping we're gonna be able to
 
00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
keep our 13th seat sullivan county we're
 
00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:48.640 align:start position:0%
one of the smallest counties in the
 
00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:50.150 align:start position:0%
one of the smallest counties in the
state

00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
and i hope we'll keep at least 13 and i
 
00:41:53.589 --> 00:41:53.599 align:start position:0%
would like to keep
 
00:41:55.349 --> 00:41:55.359 align:start position:0%
support requirement but i know it will
 
00:41:58.069 --> 00:41:58.079 align:start position:0%
not be easy and you have a very tough
 
00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
job i'm sort of glad i'm not in your
 
00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
shoes to be friendly so
 
00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:04.960 align:start position:0%
i would but i said i welcome to solve
 
00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
con i'm glad you're coming and getting

input and if you can come afford to come

to see what happens with this committee
 
00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:14.400 align:start position:0%

00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:02.800 align:start position:0%
satisfy everybody and
 
00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
hey all the big money you're getting
 
00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:08.160 align:start position:0%

really appreciate all the work you're
 
00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
doing um to put together a groundwork
 
00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire elections for the next
 
00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
10 years
 
00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:18.640 align:start position:0%
and thanks
 
00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
i have four points i wanted to mention
 
00:43:22.309 --> 00:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
to you so i'll make this quick
 
00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
first is
 
00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
as you consider sullivan county's
 
00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:28.160 align:start position:0%
community of interests communities of
 
00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:29.190 align:start position:0%
community of interests communities of
interest

00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:29.200 align:start position:0%
interest
 
00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:32.720 align:start position:0%
please keep in mind that ours very much
 
00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
follow the major transportation routes
 
00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
for example
 
00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
i-91 and route 12a
 
00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
come down the connecticut river
 
00:43:46.069 --> 00:43:46.079 align:start position:0%
that makes it very easy for those towns
 
00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
that are in the western part of the
 
00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
county to keep in touch plainfield all
 
00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:52.640 align:start position:0%
the way down to langton
 
00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
and that's where they shop and that's
 
00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:56.640 align:start position:0%
where they travel and that's how they
 
00:43:58.790 --> 00:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
get out of the region and all those
 
00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:00.710 align:start position:0%
get out of the region and all those
things

00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:44:02.550 --> 00:44:02.560 align:start position:0%
at the same time there's only one
 
00:44:06.069 --> 00:44:06.079 align:start position:0%
continuous east-west route in the county
 
00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
and that's state route 11 that stretches
 
00:44:13.109 --> 00:44:13.119 align:start position:0%
from sunapee to newport to claremont
 
00:44:15.829 --> 00:44:15.839 align:start position:0%
so in order for anybody to get across as
 
00:44:17.430 --> 00:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
brian was telling you
 
00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:18.550 align:start position:0%
brian was telling you
um

00:44:18.550 --> 00:44:18.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
you have to get
 
00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
to that route the third thing is that
 
00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
grantham has easy access to 89
 
00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
and we orient along that major route
 
00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:32.150 align:start position:0%
and we orient along that major route
um

00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:34.480 align:start position:0%
there aren't any other towns really that
 
00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
have an exit to 89 so if anyone wants to
 
00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
go there they have to come to us
 
00:44:44.069 --> 00:44:44.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
real challenges for those towns that are
 
00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
not on one of those major routes
 
00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:51.030 align:start position:0%
not on one of those major routes
because

00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:52.480 align:start position:0%
they have to
 
00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:53.510 align:start position:0%
they have to
connect

00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
connect
 
00:44:55.670 --> 00:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
with we'll call them border
 
00:44:57.589 --> 00:44:57.599 align:start position:0%
towns and some of them
 
00:44:59.270 --> 00:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
some of those border towns actually are
 
00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
out of the county
 
00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
there's been a conversation so far and
 
00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
uh as brent as i think the only
 
00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
representative of bransons who's here
 
00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:10.069 align:start position:0%
representative of bransons who's here
i

00:45:10.069 --> 00:45:10.079 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
i agree that uh springfield has much
 
00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:14.960 align:start position:0%
more alliance
 
00:45:18.150 --> 00:45:18.160 align:start position:0%
with sunapee than it does with grantham
 
00:45:21.589 --> 00:45:21.599 align:start position:0%
grantham is 40 people short
 
00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
of that magic number to get our own
 
00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:25.910 align:start position:0%
of that magic number to get our own
representative

00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:45:28.390 --> 00:45:28.400 align:start position:0%
and i would like to suggest that we
 
00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
actually um
 
00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:32.069 align:start position:0%
actually um
undoubtedly

00:45:32.069 --> 00:45:32.079 align:start position:0%
undoubtedly
 
00:45:34.630 --> 00:45:34.640 align:start position:0%
got at least that many people
 
00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
just in this summer when people were
 
00:45:38.950 --> 00:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
moving up here so
 
00:45:41.109 --> 00:45:41.119 align:start position:0%
we deserved that extra one and if you
 
00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
want to give us croydon two we'll take
 
00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:45.200 align:start position:0%
point um mccartney
 
00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
they can't get anywhere without coming
 
00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
through grantham um unless they're going
 
00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:53.200 align:start position:0%
west so uh
 
00:45:55.750 --> 00:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
those are some things to think about
 
00:45:57.829 --> 00:45:57.839 align:start position:0%
the other thing i'd like to suggest is
 
00:45:59.589 --> 00:45:59.599 align:start position:0%
that you remember that sullivan is a
 
00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
purple county
 
00:46:04.069 --> 00:46:04.079 align:start position:0%
the checklist on file with the secretary
 
00:46:05.430 --> 00:46:05.440 align:start position:0%
of state
 
00:46:08.230 --> 00:46:08.240 align:start position:0%
reflecting voter registration as of the
 
00:46:11.349 --> 00:46:11.359 align:start position:0%
2020 general election
 
00:46:13.750 --> 00:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
show a near tie between democrats and
 
00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:15.190 align:start position:0%
show a near tie between democrats and
republicans

00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
republicans
 
00:46:21.589 --> 00:46:21.599 align:start position:0%
9 676 democrats versus 9 415 republicans
 
00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
with about 1300 13 000 undeclared
 
00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
please make sure that voting districts
 
00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
reflect this balance
 
00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
in the same way new hampshire is also a
 
00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
purple state
 
00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
as you amend districts for the executive
 
00:46:39.910 --> 00:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
council particularly
 
00:46:42.069 --> 00:46:42.079 align:start position:0%
u.s house of representatives and the
 
00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
state senate
 
00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
please pay attention to this balance and
 
00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:48.160 align:start position:0%
make districts as competitive as
 
00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:50.470 align:start position:0%
make districts as competitive as
possible

00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:50.480 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
finally i want to thank you again for
 
00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:54.000 align:start position:0%

00:46:57.190 --> 00:46:57.200 align:start position:0%
once you establish draft maps that
 
00:46:59.349 --> 00:46:59.359 align:start position:0%
you're comfortable with i hope you will
 
00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:02.240 align:start position:0%
hold one more series of meetings for
 
00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:05.280 align:start position:0%

i will veto them

only with balanced non-partisan
 
00:47:27.670 --> 00:47:27.680 align:start position:0%
districts established with a transparent
 
00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:30.640 align:start position:0%
public process can we be assured that
 
00:47:33.589 --> 00:47:33.599 align:start position:0%
our state government will fairly fairly
 
00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
represent all new hampshire residents
 
00:47:38.549 --> 00:47:38.559 align:start position:0%
thank you for your attention and if you
 
00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:40.480 align:start position:0%
