00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman for the record
 
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 align:start position:0%
I am representative Jennifer Rhodes I
 
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 align:start position:0%
represent Cheshire County District 17

which is Winchester Richmond Swansea
 
00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 align:start position:0%
Troy and Fitzwilliam our Prime sponsor
 
00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 align:start position:0%
is not here this morning so I am just
 
00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 align:start position:0%
introducing House Bill 113 relative to
 
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 align:start position:0%
the physical fitness performance
 
00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 align:start position:0%
requirements for law enforcement
 
00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.050 align:start position:0%
requirements for law enforcement
officers

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 align:start position:0%
officers
 
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 align:start position:0%
and I am assuming that there are
 
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 align:start position:0%
probably some great people behind me
 
00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 align:start position:0%
that can
 
00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 align:start position:0%
testify to the reasons for this and what
 
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.210 align:start position:0%
 
Cheryl

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 align:start position:0%
there good morning
 
00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
so I'm Charles rataj I'm the chief of
 
00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 align:start position:0%
the Hinsdale police department and uh
 
00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 align:start position:0%
the reason I'm here this morning is
 
00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
because of a crisis in law enforcement
 
00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 align:start position:0%
it should come to no surprise to any of
 
00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
you that uh struggle on uh day to day
 
00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 align:start position:0%
and lately year-to-year basis with just
 
00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
keeping law enforcement officers on the
 
00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 align:start position:0%
road and responding to calls for service
 
00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:19.379 align:start position:0%
and keeping our community safe
 
00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 align:start position:0%
I'm no stranger to physical fitness
 
00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 align:start position:0%
tests I began my public service career
 
00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 align:start position:0%
in 1992 in the National Guard I've been
 
00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
taking physical fitness tests off and on
 
00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 align:start position:0%
for years and uh honestly the uh there's
 
00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 align:start position:0%
a great amount of importance in
 
00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
maintaining physical fitness the issue
 
00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 align:start position:0%
that we've come across is that uh
 
00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 align:start position:0%
several fold is that the uh this
 
00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 align:start position:0%
particular physical fitness test
 
00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 align:start position:0%
requires a test once every three years
 
00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
should the officer fail it becomes once
 
00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:50.879 align:start position:0%
every five years because they get a
 
00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
two-year waiver
 
00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 align:start position:0%
as opposed to the military or other
 
00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
places which hold a test every single
 
00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 align:start position:0%
year there's really no Great Value in
 
00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 align:start position:0%
taking a test once every five years and
 
00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 align:start position:0%
expecting that to maintain a level level
 
00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 align:start position:0%
of physical fitness looking at what
 
00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
other states do no one else has the same
 
00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 align:start position:0%
requirement they don't do this in
 
00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 align:start position:0%
Vermont they don't do this in Maine
 
00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Rhode Island or
 
00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 align:start position:0%
Connecticut only New Hampshire and the
 
00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 align:start position:0%
end result of that is that it hurts both
 
00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
recruiting and retention it hurts
 
00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 align:start position:0%
retention because we have outstanding
 
00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 align:start position:0%
fine police officers and this is usually
 
00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 align:start position:0%
the ones that are more senior with the
 
00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 align:start position:0%
most experience that just can't do their
 
00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 align:start position:0%
sit-ups fast enough or they just can't
 
00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
run the mile and a half fast enough
 
00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 align:start position:0%
it also hurts recruiting we have another
 
00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 align:start position:0%
crisis in law enforcement and it's
 
00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:43.259 align:start position:0%
amongst police administrators right now
 
00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 align:start position:0%
these senior law enforcement officials
 
00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 align:start position:0%
the sergeants the lieutenants the Chiefs
 
00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 align:start position:0%
we're the ones who are training the vast
 
00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 align:start position:0%
huge number of individuals who we're
 
00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 align:start position:0%
bringing in and the problem is that us
 
00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 align:start position:0%
older and more seasoned officers some of
 
00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 align:start position:0%
us are struggling with a PT test
 
00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 align:start position:0%
and I worry a little bit about who's
 
00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 align:start position:0%
going to train all these new people who
 
00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 align:start position:0%
were trying to recruit to fill out all
 
00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 align:start position:0%
of our ranks if we're chasing them out
 
00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 align:start position:0%
because they just can't run fast enough
 
00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 align:start position:0%
or there are a couple push-ups short
 
00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.890 align:start position:0%
or there are a couple push-ups short
um

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:17.759 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't seem to be affecting any
 
00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
of the other states and in fact it hurts
 
00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
us we can't reach out to a retired
 
00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 align:start position:0%
officer in Connecticut with 20 years and
 
00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
say hey why don't you come to New
 
00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and be a chief of police
 
00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.600 align:start position:0%
because they look at the PT requirement
 
00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100 align:start position:0%
and say well why do that when I can go
 
00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 align:start position:0%
to Vermont or I can go to Maine and
 
00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 align:start position:0%
start a second career and a second
 
00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
pension it frankly it hurts us it's a
 
00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:39.650 align:start position:0%
pension it frankly it hurts us it's a
detriment

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660 align:start position:0%
detriment
 
00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.230 align:start position:0%
detriment
um

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 align:start position:0%
and I guess uh just overall what it
 
00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 align:start position:0%
really comes down to is that
 
00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 align:start position:0%
on a daily basis we struggle and it's
 
00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
not just Hinsdale it's not just Cheshire
 
00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 align:start position:0%
county it's Statewide we're struggling
 
00:05:55.249 --> 00:05:55.259 align:start position:0%
to just answer basic calls for service
 
00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
and we're struggling to give the
 
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
communities the level of safety and
 
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
performance that they need and uh
 
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:08.100 align:start position:0%
I would rather have a large strong cop
 
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:09.960 align:start position:0%
with me on a midnight shift I just
 
00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:11.460 align:start position:0%
covered one last night I've been working
 
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of 12 to 12 and 10 to 10 even as a
 
00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.060 align:start position:0%
chief because we don't have enough
 
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
people to work and I would rather have a
 
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
large strong officer who just can't do
 
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.060 align:start position:0%
20 sit-ups with me as opposed to no
 
00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:26.940 align:start position:0%
officer at all or I would rather have a
 
00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:29.759 align:start position:0%
detective Lieutenant who's outstanding
 
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:33.660 align:start position:0%
and investigating sex offenses and who
 
00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:37.080 align:start position:0%
is in her mid to late 40s and just can't
 
00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:39.180 align:start position:0%
run a mile and a half without hurting
 
00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:40.199 align:start position:0%
her hip
 
00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:42.419 align:start position:0%
you know and I look at that and I say
 
00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
you know we this is a PT test is a
 
00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.189 align:start position:0%
you know we this is a PT test is a
luxury

00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:46.199 align:start position:0%
luxury
 
00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:48.300 align:start position:0%
and it's it's something that I feel that
 
00:06:50.749 --> 00:06:50.759 align:start position:0%
has value but I feel that it's something
 
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
that's detrimental to uh our overall
 
00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:57.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:59.390 --> 00:06:59.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:02.220 align:start position:0%
um if you could a few questions
 
00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
how would this affect the disability
 
00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:07.020 align:start position:0%
retirement system I'm surprised they
 
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:09.240 align:start position:0%
actually didn't come today because if an
 
00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:12.060 align:start position:0%
officer is become so unfit they're more
 
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:13.620 align:start position:0%
liable to an injury and on the job
 
00:07:16.129 --> 00:07:16.139 align:start position:0%
disability versus one who isn't you have
 
00:07:17.689 --> 00:07:17.699 align:start position:0%
any opinion on that or thoughts on that
 
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:19.500 align:start position:0%
my thoughts and opinion on that it
 
00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:20.460 align:start position:0%
should be up to the individual
 
00:07:22.249 --> 00:07:22.259 align:start position:0%
Department it should be up to the
 
00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:24.380 align:start position:0%
individual agency
 
00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:27.300 align:start position:0%
I think that individual agencies could
 
00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:29.940 align:start position:0%
have uh standards that require yearly
 
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
medical screenings or if individual
 
00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:34.500 align:start position:0%
agencies or or at a point where they
 
00:07:35.809 --> 00:07:35.819 align:start position:0%
could run and manage their own physical
 
00:07:37.249 --> 00:07:37.259 align:start position:0%
fitness tests I think that's a great
 
00:07:37.259 --> 00:07:38.330 align:start position:0%
fitness tests I think that's a great
idea

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:38.340 align:start position:0%
idea
 
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:41.340 align:start position:0%
you know I remember a time where we
 
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:43.380 align:start position:0%
could have 20 applicants for one job and
 
00:07:44.749 --> 00:07:44.759 align:start position:0%
the hiring board would be arguing about
 
00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:47.580 align:start position:0%
hiring the top three
 
00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:49.800 align:start position:0%
now we're lucky if we get three
 
00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.830 align:start position:0%
now we're lucky if we get three
unfortunately

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:54.360 align:start position:0%
um my second question is is there a
 
00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:57.180 align:start position:0%
sliding scale as an officer ages where
 
00:07:59.689 --> 00:07:59.699 align:start position:0%
the the like in the military when you're
 
00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:02.340 align:start position:0%
17 it's 50 push-ups in two minutes and
 
00:08:04.969 --> 00:08:04.979 align:start position:0%
57 what about as it ages does it get
 
00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:08.580 align:start position:0%
less there is there's a sliding scale
 
00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
um but even with a sliding scale I mean
 
00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:13.500 align:start position:0%
I don't think that it takes into account
 
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
um injuries
 
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:17.460 align:start position:0%
or it doesn't take into account the
 
00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
overall Fitness level I recently had a
 
00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
71 school year old school resource
 
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
officer who retired he was an avid hiker
 
00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:28.680 align:start position:0%
and you could put a 30 pound backpack on
 
00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:30.180 align:start position:0%
them and he could hike all day long
 
00:08:32.389 --> 00:08:32.399 align:start position:0%
however he struggled with the impact
 
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
that the concrete had on his 71 year old
 
00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:40.070 align:start position:0%
that the concrete had on his 71 year old
joints

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Rhodes
 
00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:43.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:45.540 align:start position:0%
taking my question would you be able to
 
00:08:47.389 --> 00:08:47.399 align:start position:0%
explain to the committee what the
 
00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:51.060 align:start position:0%
difference is on recruiting or hiring
 
00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:53.640 align:start position:0%
officers between New Hampshire and
 
00:08:55.009 --> 00:08:55.019 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts because my understanding
 
00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
is there it's not done the same way as
 
00:08:59.870 --> 00:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
far as training and recruiting
 
00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
no training and recruiting are two
 
00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:04.140 align:start position:0%
separate things if they're recruited by
 
00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:06.420 align:start position:0%
the agency that's just the beginning of
 
00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
the hiring process they still need to go
 
00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:12.360 align:start position:0%
to uh to the police academy where they
 
00:09:14.329 --> 00:09:14.339 align:start position:0%
have to undergo a physical fitness test
 
00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:16.160 align:start position:0%
there's medical
 
00:09:20.509 --> 00:09:20.519 align:start position:0%
requirements and um a legal package that
 
00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
they would have to either test out of or
 
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:28.260 align:start position:0%
just just for clarity do you know how
 
00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:30.660 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts does it I am unaware of
 
00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:33.540 align:start position:0%
how Massachusetts does our system okay
 
00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
just for the committee it's
 
00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:37.380 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts civil service system where
 
00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
you have to take an exam and they have
 
00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:41.640 align:start position:0%
to choose from the exam
 
00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:43.320 align:start position:0%
um other questions from the committee
 
00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:47.509 align:start position:0%
um other questions from the committee
representative

00:09:47.509 --> 00:09:47.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:49.620 align:start position:0%
so are you looking to do away with it
 
00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:51.540 align:start position:0%
all or replace it with something else
 
00:09:54.829 --> 00:09:54.839 align:start position:0%
just kind of I'm looking to do away with
 
00:09:56.449 --> 00:09:56.459 align:start position:0%
the entire thing and place a
 
00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:58.200 align:start position:0%
responsibility back on the individual
 
00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
to to what extent uh
 
00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:17.580 align:start position:0%
is an officer who isn't in good shape
 
00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:21.240 align:start position:0%
um to what extent do they present a
 
00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:24.060 align:start position:0%
potential issue uh for other for other
 
00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:26.700 align:start position:0%
officers and members of the public in
 
00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:32.820 align:start position:0%
I think that that's uh mixed I think
 
00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:35.160 align:start position:0%
that there are some agencies where um
 
00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:37.380 align:start position:0%
they maintain strict standards and
 
00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:39.660 align:start position:0%
that's no issue at all I think that
 
00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
there are some agencies out there that
 
00:10:45.889 --> 00:10:45.899 align:start position:0%
have allowed some individuals who uh are
 
00:10:49.069 --> 00:10:49.079 align:start position:0%
overweight or obese who they probably
 
00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:51.540 align:start position:0%
should hold accountable and I think that
 
00:10:53.329 --> 00:10:53.339 align:start position:0%
agencies can do that through their own
 
00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:55.980 align:start position:0%
policies and their own procedures
 
00:10:57.889 --> 00:10:57.899 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:01.380 align:start position:0%
one more question does the the city or
 
00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:03.420 align:start position:0%
town or does anyone provide these
 
00:11:06.949 --> 00:11:06.959 align:start position:0%
officers paid time to maintain their
 
00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:09.420 align:start position:0%
Fitness to work out to
 
00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:12.180 align:start position:0%
some agencies the agencies do different
 
00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
things have seen many of them provide
 
00:11:17.389 --> 00:11:17.399 align:start position:0%
incentive bonuses for employees who
 
00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
maintain a level of physical fitness if
 
00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:22.740 align:start position:0%
you pass the test they'll toss you 500
 
00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:25.260 align:start position:0%
or 300 or whatever dollars the problem
 
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
with that is that uh in most of our
 
00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:30.060 align:start position:0%
agencies we're short staffed so they're
 
00:11:32.509 --> 00:11:32.519 align:start position:0%
working end over end 12-hour shifts
 
00:11:33.949 --> 00:11:33.959 align:start position:0%
which leaves them virtually no time for
 
00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
physical fitness and it becomes a
 
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
repeating Loop where you have no help
 
00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:39.660 align:start position:0%
they work harder they don't have time to
 
00:11:41.389 --> 00:11:41.399 align:start position:0%
work out which then makes them work
 
00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:43.980 align:start position:0%
harder PT test time
 
00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
which as opposed to people that are
 
00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:48.060 align:start position:0%
incarcerated who have all day to work
 
00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:51.420 align:start position:0%
out and gonna come out in great shape
 
00:11:53.269 --> 00:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
um okay thank you is there any further
 
00:11:53.279 --> 00:11:54.410 align:start position:0%
um okay thank you is there any further
questions

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:54.420 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
00:11:58.850 --> 00:11:58.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:25.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman Roy members of the

civilian manager of the Antrim Police
 
00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:35.990 align:start position:0%

Department
 
00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:37.620 align:start position:0%
and I submit this testimony in support
 
00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
of hb133
 
00:12:41.389 --> 00:12:41.399 align:start position:0%
on behalf of myself
 
00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
I have been in law enforcement for 15
 
00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.389 align:start position:0%
I have been in law enforcement for 15
years

00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:12:46.009 --> 00:12:46.019 align:start position:0%
I began my career with the Antrim Police
 
00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
Department in 2008. have risen up
 
00:12:50.329 --> 00:12:50.339 align:start position:0%
through the ranks worked hard and
 
00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:53.160 align:start position:0%
reached the rank of Chief of Police
 
00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
in that time in 2019 I
 
00:12:59.090 --> 00:12:59.100 align:start position:0%
while training for the PT test I injured
 
00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:03.300 align:start position:0%
my knee which required surgery to repair
 
00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:04.740 align:start position:0%
because I wasn't going to meet the
 
00:13:06.829 --> 00:13:06.839 align:start position:0%
deadline the three-year deadline I opted
 
00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
for a medical waiver from the academy
 
00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:10.680 align:start position:0%
which was accepted this allowed me to
 
00:13:12.829 --> 00:13:12.839 align:start position:0%
keep my certification while I recovered
 
00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:14.220 align:start position:0%
from surgery
 
00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:16.260 align:start position:0%
and then began training again for the PD
 
00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.050 align:start position:0%
and then began training again for the PD
test

00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:18.060 align:start position:0%
test
 
00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:19.740 align:start position:0%
once I began training again after the
 
00:13:21.949 --> 00:13:21.959 align:start position:0%
knee surgery and Recovery I developed
 
00:13:23.829 --> 00:13:23.839 align:start position:0%
another medical condition
 
00:13:26.509 --> 00:13:26.519 align:start position:0%
basically after many many visits to the
 
00:13:28.129 --> 00:13:28.139 align:start position:0%
doctor and many many tests
 
00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
I was diagnosed with a defective aortic
 
00:13:32.449 --> 00:13:32.459 align:start position:0%
heart valve which needed to be repaired
 
00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:37.980 align:start position:0%
having to do that at that time I was
 
00:13:39.889 --> 00:13:39.899 align:start position:0%
again not to meet the deadline from my
 
00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:41.700 align:start position:0%
medical waiver extension my
 
00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:43.620 align:start position:0%
certification was suspended
 
00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
and there were no other options for me
 
00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:46.600 align:start position:0%
at that time
 
00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.290 align:start position:0%
at that time
[Music]

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:48.300 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:51.060 align:start position:0%
I was able to work with the town they
 
00:13:53.269 --> 00:13:53.279 align:start position:0%
agreed to keep me on as the chief in a
 
00:13:55.129 --> 00:13:55.139 align:start position:0%
different title civilian manager
 
00:13:58.370 --> 00:13:58.380 align:start position:0%
administrator and since that time I have
 
00:13:59.329 --> 00:13:59.339 align:start position:0%
been running the police department
 
00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:02.220 align:start position:0%
day-to-day managing the police
 
00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:04.260 align:start position:0%
department everything that a certified
 
00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
uniform police chief would do the only
 
00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
difference is I can't wear the uniform
 
00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:09.660 align:start position:0%
and I can't perform any law enforcement
 
00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:15.949 --> 00:14:15.959 align:start position:0%
the reason I'm not certified is because
 
00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:17.700 align:start position:0%
in my opinion it's an unfair standard
 
00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't take into account
 
00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
medical conditions that are not the
 
00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
fault of the officer
 
00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:26.940 align:start position:0%
I have been training
 
00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:30.660 align:start position:0%
extensively since 2019 since recovering
 
00:14:33.949 --> 00:14:33.959 align:start position:0%
from my surgeries I've hired a personal
 
00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
coach and a professional running coach
 
00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:39.540 align:start position:0%
to help me with my training
 
00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
I can do everything I'm in great health
 
00:14:46.189 --> 00:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
I have a strict diet I exercise nearly
 
00:14:48.949 --> 00:14:48.959 align:start position:0%
every single day but I can't finish the
 
00:14:58.910 --> 00:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:01.009 --> 00:15:01.019 align:start position:0%
the current PT requirement is proven to
 
00:15:02.569 --> 00:15:02.579 align:start position:0%
be a hardship for me
 
00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:04.620 align:start position:0%
and many of the law enforcements I am in
 
00:15:06.769 --> 00:15:06.779 align:start position:0%
danger of losing my job because I can't
 
00:15:11.509 --> 00:15:11.519 align:start position:0%
pass this one portion of this test
 
00:15:13.189 --> 00:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
this is hurting law enforcement in New
 
00:15:14.689 --> 00:15:14.699 align:start position:0%
Hampshire especially at a time
 
00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:17.160 align:start position:0%
when there are Mass retirements from law
 
00:15:18.889 --> 00:15:18.899 align:start position:0%
enforcement along with an unprecedented
 
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:21.240 align:start position:0%
lack of applicants to fill the multitude
 
00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:22.620 align:start position:0%
of vacancies
 
00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
not only New Hampshire but across this
 
00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
great nation
 
00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:28.980 align:start position:0%
losing experienced in highly qualified
 
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
officers is not in the best interest of
 
00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:33.660 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law enforcement
 
00:15:35.689 --> 00:15:35.699 align:start position:0%
in closing I asked that you find this
 
00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
bill ought to pass thank you for your
 
00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:42.290 align:start position:0%
bill ought to pass thank you for your
consideration

00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:42.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
with your condition do you qualify for
 
00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:46.500 align:start position:0%
medical retirement
 
00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:49.320 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure let's look into that okay
 
00:15:50.569 --> 00:15:50.579 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:15:53.449 --> 00:15:53.459 align:start position:0%
representative Newman
 
00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:55.860 align:start position:0%
with the repeal of these two law two
 
00:15:58.250 --> 00:15:58.260 align:start position:0%
laws that cover physical fitness is that
 
00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:01.320 align:start position:0%
in and alone sufficient to make it so
 
00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
that it wouldn't be a problem anymore or
 
00:16:08.329 --> 00:16:08.339 align:start position:0%
are there other laws that might come in
 
00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
yes repealing this law for the fiscal
 
00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
requirement the ongoing Fitness
 
00:16:14.389 --> 00:16:14.399 align:start position:0%
requirement would certainly help me I
 
00:16:17.509 --> 00:16:17.519 align:start position:0%
would be able to keep my job if it were
 
00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:20.940 align:start position:0%
to be repealed and I'm going to start
 
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
the process but I would think that I
 
00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:24.540 align:start position:0%
could get my certification back and
 
00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:27.420 align:start position:0%
continue on with my career
 
00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:30.720 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:33.180 align:start position:0%
representative jambrian
 
00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:34.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:35.940 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:39.060 align:start position:0%
uh are you aware of any
 
00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:41.820 align:start position:0%
criminal of of any
 
00:16:44.269 --> 00:16:44.279 align:start position:0%
law enforcement jobs that do not have
 
00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:46.680 align:start position:0%
this requirement that they go and be
 
00:16:49.129 --> 00:16:49.139 align:start position:0%
certified by the police academy I
 
00:16:51.949 --> 00:16:51.959 align:start position:0%
specifically know of two elected
 
00:16:53.269 --> 00:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
positions in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
that don't require uh certification but
 
00:16:58.069 --> 00:16:58.079 align:start position:0%
you can also be a law enforcement
 
00:16:58.079 --> 00:16:59.870 align:start position:0%
you can also be a law enforcement
officer

00:16:59.870 --> 00:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
officer
 
00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:01.620 align:start position:0%
yeah I believe the sheriff can be
 
00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:03.660 align:start position:0%
elected and I'm not sure the other one
 
00:17:04.909 --> 00:17:04.919 align:start position:0%
you're speaking of but of course the
 
00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
only one I know of
 
00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:09.540 align:start position:0%
a constable Constable yeah
 
00:17:11.090 --> 00:17:11.100 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:17.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
warning Mr chair it's okay if we uh
 
00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:35.820 align:start position:0%

Mr chair and members of the committee to

testify on House Bill 113.
 
00:18:03.610 --> 00:18:03.620 align:start position:0%
um the association
 
00:18:06.169 --> 00:18:06.179 align:start position:0%
will not take a position however we just
 
00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:07.260 align:start position:0%
want to provide you with some
 
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
information that might help
 
00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:11.700 align:start position:0%
um you make a better informed decision
 
00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:13.260 align:start position:0%
on this legislation
 
00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
at a December meeting of the New
 
00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:17.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of chiefs of
 
00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
police we discussed at length this
 
00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:21.610 align:start position:0%
police we discussed at length this
legislation

00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:21.620 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
with the intent of trying to determine
 
00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:27.020 align:start position:0%
the association's stance and position
 
00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:29.580 align:start position:0%
I can tell you the discussions were very
 
00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:32.580 align:start position:0%
lengthy they were spirited in a good way
 
00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:34.980 align:start position:0%
and the points of view range from
 
00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:38.220 align:start position:0%
supporting the legislation to not
 
00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
supporting the elimination of these
 
00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:43.020 align:start position:0%
standards to modifying the current
 
00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
physical fitness testing battery so it's
 
00:18:48.409 --> 00:18:48.419 align:start position:0%
more job specific to the role of a
 
00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
police officer and matches the functions
 
00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:53.340 align:start position:0%
of of the position
 
00:18:56.029 --> 00:18:56.039 align:start position:0%
uh give her given uh the differing
 
00:18:58.010 --> 00:18:58.020 align:start position:0%
points of view in the overall lack of
 
00:18:58.020 --> 00:18:59.690 align:start position:0%
points of view in the overall lack of
consensus

00:18:59.690 --> 00:18:59.700 align:start position:0%
consensus
 
00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
um what we determined it is it would be
 
00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.289 align:start position:0%
um what we determined it is it would be
best

00:19:03.289 --> 00:19:03.299 align:start position:0%
best
 
00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:05.700 align:start position:0%
um to form a subcommittee uh to discuss
 
00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
these issues in further detail uh with
 
00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:11.700 align:start position:0%
the purpose of presenting information to
 
00:19:13.669 --> 00:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
our executive board in general
 
00:19:13.679 --> 00:19:15.470 align:start position:0%
our executive board in general
membership

00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:15.480 align:start position:0%
membership
 
00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
um some of the points of view relative
 
00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:18.780 align:start position:0%
to the legislation
 
00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
and so in fact on January 4th we did do
 
00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
that we met as a subcommittee which
 
00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:26.460 align:start position:0%
included myself Chief trelay director
 
00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:28.860 align:start position:0%
Skipper from pstc who's present today
 
00:19:31.669 --> 00:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
Chief aldenberg from Manchester Chief
 
00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:34.500 align:start position:0%
Levick from Merrimack Chief profansky
 
00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
from Bedford and then of course Captain
 
00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
Hawkins from pstc
 
00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
some of the key points and take
 
00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
takeaways of our meeting of our work
 
00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:46.669 align:start position:0%
takeaways of our meeting of our work
um

00:19:46.669 --> 00:19:46.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
ours Falls I'll just read a few that
 
00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
there's some concern the current fitness
 
00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:53.700 align:start position:0%
test requirements could be challenged
 
00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:55.500 align:start position:0%
could be challenged under the federal
 
00:19:57.490 --> 00:19:57.500 align:start position:0%
civil rights act
 
00:20:00.409 --> 00:20:00.419 align:start position:0%
it is important to note that the
 
00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
legislation Deals Only with incumbent
 
00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.409 align:start position:0%
legislation Deals Only with incumbent
testing

00:20:03.409 --> 00:20:03.419 align:start position:0%
testing
 
00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:05.900 align:start position:0%
meaning those folks who are
 
00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:09.200 align:start position:0%
in the profession are already certified
 
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
developing and implementing New
 
00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire specific testing battery would
 
00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:16.140 align:start position:0%
take specific time and would be
 
00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:17.630 align:start position:0%
take specific time and would be
expensive

00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:17.640 align:start position:0%
expensive
 
00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:20.160 align:start position:0%
but there is potential to use other
 
00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
physical ability testing batteries from
 
00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
other states like Massachusetts for
 
00:20:27.409 --> 00:20:27.419 align:start position:0%
example that would be an option but we
 
00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
would need to consider how these tests
 
00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:32.460 align:start position:0%
would be administered
 
00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:34.260 align:start position:0%
um we're very concerned there is some
 
00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:35.940 align:start position:0%
concern amongst the membership about
 
00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:38.220 align:start position:0%
medical requirements and medical
 
00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:40.010 align:start position:0%
medical requirements and medical
assessments

00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:40.020 align:start position:0%
assessments
 
00:20:42.049 --> 00:20:42.059 align:start position:0%
so if the standard does in fact go away
 
00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:44.820 align:start position:0%
what will the medical requirements be to
 
00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
ensure that we have uh officers who
 
00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
don't have existing conditions that
 
00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:53.039 align:start position:0%
would limit their ability to perform the
 
00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:55.100 align:start position:0%
job which certainly ties into the whole
 
00:20:58.850 --> 00:20:58.860 align:start position:0%
perspective of risk management and and
 
00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
liability as well
 
00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
staffing issues certainly which you
 
00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
heard from the chief earlier are always
 
00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
of concern as well as recruitment and
 
00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:11.090 align:start position:0%
of concern as well as recruitment and
retention

00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:11.100 align:start position:0%
retention
 
00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:13.260 align:start position:0%
we also think it's important to to
 
00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
mention officer Wellness
 
00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
and we mentioned Wellness because we
 
00:21:19.669 --> 00:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
know that physical fitness is a key
 
00:21:21.409 --> 00:21:21.419 align:start position:0%
component of that
 
00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:24.900 align:start position:0%
so in an effort to kind of filter and
 
00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:26.160 align:start position:0%
sift through some of these
 
00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.590 align:start position:0%
sift through some of these
considerations

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
considerations
 
00:21:31.789 --> 00:21:31.799 align:start position:0%
what we did was we we created a survey
 
00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:34.100 align:start position:0%
there's five questions survey
 
00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:36.780 align:start position:0%
and I'll let Chief to relay speak to the
 
00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:40.020 align:start position:0%
results of the survey for you
 
00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:41.880 align:start position:0%
so seeing as I get the hard part of
 
00:21:43.789 --> 00:21:43.799 align:start position:0%
remembering all the numbers I'm going to
 
00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
read off the paper so I apologize
 
00:21:49.669 --> 00:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
in collaboration with Captain Hawkins at
 
00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:52.440 align:start position:0%
psdc the survey was created within the
 
00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:54.900 align:start position:0%
Benchmark analytics system which every
 
00:21:57.409 --> 00:21:57.419 align:start position:0%
Chief in the state has access to the
 
00:21:58.850 --> 00:21:58.860 align:start position:0%
survey was then distributed through
 
00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
Benchmark and by way of Association
 
00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
emails to the C the Chiefs with a
 
00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:07.140 align:start position:0%
completion deadline of January 24th
 
00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:09.240 align:start position:0%
once every completion period ended
 
00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:10.860 align:start position:0%
Captain Hawkins compiled the results
 
00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
which are included in the attached
 
00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:13.850 align:start position:0%
which are included in the attached
document

00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:13.860 align:start position:0%
document
 
00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:17.580 align:start position:0%
we received a res we received replies
 
00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:20.340 align:start position:0%
from 108 Chiefs provided answers to the
 
00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:22.559 align:start position:0%
questions listed in this memo which
 
00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:26.280 align:start position:0%
constitutes in 49 response rate from all
 
00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:28.500 align:start position:0%
the Chiefs in regards to the questions
 
00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
as to whether the CEOs or the Chiefs
 
00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:32.580 align:start position:0%
support the elimination of the ongoing
 
00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
PT test requirements 62 percent of the
 
00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
chiefs polled were in agreement with the
 
00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:39.780 align:start position:0%
course of action to eliminate the PT
 
00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:41.690 align:start position:0%
course of action to eliminate the PT
standard

00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:41.700 align:start position:0%
standard
 
00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:45.240 align:start position:0%
29 of those polls of those polled answer
 
00:22:47.149 --> 00:22:47.159 align:start position:0%
they did not support the elimination of
 
00:22:49.669 --> 00:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
the of the PT standard while nine
 
00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
percent were unsure
 
00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
the results also indicated
 
00:22:55.909 --> 00:22:55.919 align:start position:0%
that should this standard remain in
 
00:22:57.409 --> 00:22:57.419 align:start position:0%
place an overwhelming percentage of
 
00:22:58.909 --> 00:22:58.919 align:start position:0%
those polled would support the
 
00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
modification of current Fitness
 
00:23:03.169 --> 00:23:03.179 align:start position:0%
standards reflected in a test a battery
 
00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:04.980 align:start position:0%
of tests that were more closely aligned
 
00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:07.740 align:start position:0%
to job function of a police officer
 
00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
about 50 percent of those polled have
 
00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:11.700 align:start position:0%
had the certification of an officer
 
00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:13.620 align:start position:0%
working their agency placed on probation
 
00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:15.230 align:start position:0%
working their agency placed on probation
status

00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:15.240 align:start position:0%
status
 
00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:16.860 align:start position:0%
due to the inability to meet this
 
00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:19.260 align:start position:0%
current standards around 20 percent of
 
00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
chiefs polled indicated that officers
 
00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
within their agency have had their
 
00:23:25.789 --> 00:23:25.799 align:start position:0%
certification suspended due to failure
 
00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:28.380 align:start position:0%
to meet the current PT standard
 
00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:31.620 align:start position:0%
finally of the Chiefs polled roughly 52
 
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
percent indicated they would develop and
 
00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
Implement their own Fitness and Agility
 
00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:37.980 align:start position:0%
testing requirement as well as medical
 
00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:40.549 align:start position:0%
testing requirement as well as medical
evaluation

00:23:40.549 --> 00:23:40.559 align:start position:0%
evaluation
 
00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
although roughly 62 percent of the
 
00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:44.220 align:start position:0%
Chiefs who completed the survey support
 
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:46.140 align:start position:0%
the elimination of this standard there
 
00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:47.820 align:start position:0%
was still a relatively high percentage
 
00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:50.340 align:start position:0%
of chiefs who do not support this cause
 
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
of action
 
00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:56.029 align:start position:0%
of action
uh

00:23:56.029 --> 00:23:56.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:58.490 --> 00:23:58.500 align:start position:0%
with the 50 response rate which means
 
00:24:00.289 --> 00:24:00.299 align:start position:0%
that less than 25 percent of the
 
00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:02.280 align:start position:0%
association body has indicated that they
 
00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:04.200 align:start position:0%
desired to eliminate the physical
 
00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:10.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
is that complete your testimony
 
00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:13.500 align:start position:0%
that completes we'd be happy to answer
 
00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:15.900 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you Mr chair could
 
00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:17.700 align:start position:0%
you explain to the committee how it
 
00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
works if an officer is injured on duty
 
00:24:24.649 --> 00:24:24.659 align:start position:0%
um with regard to disability retirement
 
00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:26.100 align:start position:0%
Glenn do you want to take that or do you
 
00:24:27.649 --> 00:24:27.659 align:start position:0%
want me to handle that one
 
00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
of your officers breaks their knee and
 
00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:32.280 align:start position:0%
they can't work anymore what what are
 
00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:34.260 align:start position:0%
they entitled to what are they able to
 
00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:36.740 align:start position:0%
receive and who pays for it so
 
00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
there would become our covered under
 
00:24:42.289 --> 00:24:42.299 align:start position:0%
workers compensation and then uh if they
 
00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:43.500 align:start position:0%
would have to work with the New
 
00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:45.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement system to qualify
 
00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
for a medical retirement that's kind of
 
00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:49.740 align:start position:0%
a snapshot I
 
00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:51.900 align:start position:0%
worked with an officer who had a similar
 
00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
circumstance about five or six years ago
 
00:24:56.149 --> 00:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
and do you recall what the percentages
 
00:24:58.909 --> 00:24:58.919 align:start position:0%
what they of their pay they get on a on
 
00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
a retired disability retirement yeah
 
00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
it's 66 and two-thirds I believe of
 
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
their average depending on current
 
00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
construct of where they fall in the
 
00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
retirement program okay and and that
 
00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:13.740 align:start position:0%
disability retirement is paid out of the
 
00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:16.500 align:start position:0%
state retirement system so all of the
 
00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities contribute into that is
 
00:25:21.049 --> 00:25:21.059 align:start position:0%
that correct that's correct New
 
00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:23.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement system from police
 
00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:26.460 align:start position:0%
group two okay thank you
 
00:25:28.549 --> 00:25:28.559 align:start position:0%
um I think uh Chief Joe lay ahead yeah
 
00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
just just one follow-up that I and I'm
 
00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:34.380 align:start position:0%
not 100 on this but I think that officer
 
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
would have a fight on his hands that if
 
00:25:37.669 --> 00:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
he's at Planet Fitness on his own time
 
00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:41.400 align:start position:0%
working out gets hurt he may not be
 
00:25:42.769 --> 00:25:42.779 align:start position:0%
entitled to anything even though he's
 
00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:44.220 align:start position:0%
doing it for three years because he's on
 
00:25:45.529 --> 00:25:45.539 align:start position:0%
his own time and he's not currently
 
00:25:48.649 --> 00:25:48.659 align:start position:0%
working at that point so your point is
 
00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:50.220 align:start position:0%
if he's training for the PT test and
 
00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:52.620 align:start position:0%
gets hurt training he's you may not get
 
00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
a get a dime he may be out of a job
 
00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:25:58.370 --> 00:25:58.380 align:start position:0%
um representative Rhodes thank you Mr
 
00:25:59.690 --> 00:25:59.700 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
question I think that you might have
 
00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:04.140 align:start position:0%
said this in your testimony just wanted
 
00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:07.860 align:start position:0%
to clarify did you say that this test is
 
00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:10.200 align:start position:0%
only for incumbent officers so if you
 
00:26:12.649 --> 00:26:12.659 align:start position:0%
were 22 graduating out of high school
 
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to become a police officer this
 
00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:17.100 align:start position:0%
you don't have to do this physical
 
00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
fitness test
 
00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:21.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:23.700 align:start position:0%
you do have to do this fitness test
 
00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:28.020 align:start position:0%
anyone hired after January 1st 2001 I
 
00:26:29.149 --> 00:26:29.159 align:start position:0%
was actually the first police academy
 
00:26:32.269 --> 00:26:32.279 align:start position:0%
class to go through it with my
 
00:26:34.909 --> 00:26:34.919 align:start position:0%
fellow Academy made over here
 
00:26:38.029 --> 00:26:38.039 align:start position:0%
um and uh so we were the first class to
 
00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:40.200 align:start position:0%
required to meet this three-year if
 
00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:42.900 align:start position:0%
you're a officer who's applying for a
 
00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:43.980 align:start position:0%
job you have to meet the fitness
 
00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
required requirements as as specified in
 
00:26:49.930 --> 00:26:49.940 align:start position:0%
Police Academy
 
00:26:53.269 --> 00:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
policies a 35th percentile of Cooper
 
00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
standard ongoing PT test is the same
 
00:26:59.630 --> 00:26:59.640 align:start position:0%
standard so every three years you would
 
00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:01.860 align:start position:0%
have to take a fitness test
 
00:27:04.669 --> 00:27:04.679 align:start position:0%
which is the incumbent testing at the
 
00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
35th percentile in its age and gender
 
00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:09.409 align:start position:0%
35th percentile in its age and gender
specific

00:27:09.409 --> 00:27:09.419 align:start position:0%
specific
 
00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:11.580 align:start position:0%
if that makes sense
 
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
yeah just to clarify this is not
 
00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
changing the standard to get into the
 
00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
police academy no this is only for the
 
00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:21.720 align:start position:0%
ongoing officer that's already hired and
 
00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
every three years until they retire have
 
00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:25.860 align:start position:0%
to keep taking this test
 
00:27:29.090 --> 00:27:29.100 align:start position:0%
so three years goes by they test if they
 
00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
fail they're given two more years to
 
00:27:32.269 --> 00:27:32.279 align:start position:0%
pass it
 
00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:34.140 align:start position:0%
and then they're on probate their
 
00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
certification is held in probation if
 
00:27:37.789 --> 00:27:37.799 align:start position:0%
they don't pass it after that then they
 
00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
their certification goes on the
 
00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
suspension so it does not change the
 
00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:44.820 align:start position:0%
standards for an officer getting hired
 
00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:47.460 align:start position:0%
brand new it's for the currently hired
 
00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:49.380 align:start position:0%
officers and going forward once they're
 
00:27:53.289 --> 00:27:53.299 align:start position:0%
hired to retest every three years
 
00:27:56.029 --> 00:27:56.039 align:start position:0%
okay so for clarification because that
 
00:27:58.850 --> 00:27:58.860 align:start position:0%
was my concern if a new officer being
 
00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:01.380 align:start position:0%
hired the first time this would not
 
00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:02.700 align:start position:0%
apply to them they would have to go
 
00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:05.220 align:start position:0%
through the the same training pass the
 
00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
test this is for once you're already
 
00:28:08.090 --> 00:28:08.100 align:start position:0%
hired and you're already a working
 
00:28:11.269 --> 00:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
officer correct thank you
 
00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:13.030 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I confused you
 
00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:16.070 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I confused you
[Laughter]

00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:28:18.289 --> 00:28:18.299 align:start position:0%
representative Murray
 
00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:19.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:28:21.049 --> 00:28:21.059 align:start position:0%
taking my question I was just going to
 
00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:22.440 align:start position:0%
ask if you would be able to send the
 
00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
survey data that you were reading to the
 
00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:25.490 align:start position:0%
survey data that you were reading to the
committee

00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:25.500 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:28.380 align:start position:0%
thank you yes ma'am I'll do that today
 
00:28:30.649 --> 00:28:30.659 align:start position:0%
I have one more question
 
00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:32.220 align:start position:0%
um earlier I heard testimony that
 
00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:34.020 align:start position:0%
there's a waiver system you get one one
 
00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:35.640 align:start position:0%
waiver possibly
 
00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
um with regard to uh if you're having
 
00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:40.740 align:start position:0%
surgery or something like that
 
00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:43.380 align:start position:0%
So within the three-year period
 
00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
if you extend beyond that there's up to
 
00:28:49.549 --> 00:28:49.559 align:start position:0%
two additional years of waivers so five
 
00:28:51.649 --> 00:28:51.659 align:start position:0%
years to pass
 
00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:54.260 align:start position:0%
a B2 test
 
00:28:57.890 --> 00:28:57.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:01.020 align:start position:0%
I think I'm clear about the uh incumbent
 
00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:03.240 align:start position:0%
officers in the academy what about
 
00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:04.980 align:start position:0%
somebody who is already an officer
 
00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
somewhere and then gets hired in the
 
00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:08.460 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire maybe from out of
 
00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:11.100 align:start position:0%
state what would they be subject to as
 
00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:13.320 align:start position:0%
far as PT requirements at this point
 
00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
they would be also required to take the
 
00:29:18.529 --> 00:29:18.539 align:start position:0%
three year PT so if you and I think the
 
00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
chief before us talked about it if a
 
00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
chief or an officer retires in Maine
 
00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:26.520 align:start position:0%
that does 20 years comes over New
 
00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:27.409 align:start position:0%
that does 20 years comes over New
Hampshire

00:29:27.409 --> 00:29:27.419 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:29:29.149 --> 00:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
gets their certification through the law
 
00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
package of the academy they would have
 
00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:35.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:38.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:41.389 --> 00:29:41.399 align:start position:0%
so when and when so would they take one
 
00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:43.140 align:start position:0%
immediately and then every three years
 
00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
they would take one of me thank you
 
00:29:48.889 --> 00:29:48.899 align:start position:0%
no further questions thank you very much
 
00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:18.049 --> 00:30:18.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:19.850 --> 00:30:19.860 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair good morning
 
00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
committee members for the record my name
 
00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
is John skippa I'm the director of New
 
00:30:26.149 --> 00:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire police standards and training
 
00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:29.580 align:start position:0%
and I have with me here today uh Captain
 
00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:34.200 align:start position:0%
Adam Hawkins of our agency who oversees
 
00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:36.140 align:start position:0%
the fitness program
 
00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:40.260 align:start position:0%
we appear here today to really be a
 
00:30:43.909 --> 00:30:43.919 align:start position:0%
source uh to answer any questions that
 
00:30:45.529 --> 00:30:45.539 align:start position:0%
anyone might have
 
00:30:48.909 --> 00:30:48.919 align:start position:0%
for some historical background this test
 
00:30:52.549 --> 00:30:52.559 align:start position:0%
that is now mandatory to incumbent
 
00:30:59.810 --> 00:30:59.820 align:start position:0%
officers started in 2001 it was brought
 
00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:00.980 align:start position:0%
to fruition
 
00:31:07.130 --> 00:31:07.140 align:start position:0%
in an effort to establish a level of
 
00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
Fitness across New Hampshire law
 
00:31:11.690 --> 00:31:11.700 align:start position:0%
enforcement to reduce workers comp
 
00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:14.340 align:start position:0%
claims and to make sure that police
 
00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
officers were able to meet the
 
00:31:20.090 --> 00:31:20.100 align:start position:0%
challenges of their jobs
 
00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:22.490 align:start position:0%
challenges of their jobs
uh

00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:22.500 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:31:26.029 --> 00:31:26.039 align:start position:0%
we are the only state in the country
 
00:31:29.330 --> 00:31:29.340 align:start position:0%
that requires ongoing Fitness testing
 
00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
for all certified officers uh within our
 
00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:35.450 align:start position:0%
for all certified officers uh within our
state

00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:35.460 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:31:38.450 --> 00:31:38.460 align:start position:0%
uh I can tell you that uh we are the
 
00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
Envy of of some other states I have the
 
00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:44.100 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak to a number of my
 
00:31:47.930 --> 00:31:47.940 align:start position:0%
peers at different conferences and uh
 
00:31:49.669 --> 00:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
I've been approached a number of times
 
00:31:51.889 --> 00:31:51.899 align:start position:0%
by other states to ask how we do this
 
00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
program and how they want to establish
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
the same thing but it is important to
 
00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
recognize that we are the only state
 
00:32:00.049 --> 00:32:00.059 align:start position:0%
that requires this
 
00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:03.480 align:start position:0%
uh the police Academy's position is that
 
00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
we really want to encourage and build
 
00:32:09.409 --> 00:32:09.419 align:start position:0%
out a program that's going to help
 
00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
officers stay well and be resilient
 
00:32:16.610 --> 00:32:16.620 align:start position:0%
across their entire career part of that
 
00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:19.140 align:start position:0%
resiliency is based on their level of
 
00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
fitness and it's been demonstrated time
 
00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:23.580 align:start position:0%
and time again how important it is for
 
00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:26.700 align:start position:0%
that those officers to have a level of
 
00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:29.640 align:start position:0%
Fitness that will help them get through
 
00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:32.700 align:start position:0%
their careers very challenging career
 
00:32:37.389 --> 00:32:37.399 align:start position:0%
uh with that said we also recognize that
 
00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:40.380 align:start position:0%
this fitness test that we use now which
 
00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:44.460 align:start position:0%
uh comes from the Cooper uh Institute of
 
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
anaerobic research uh
 
00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
is a test that's been in play for uh 20
 
00:32:52.909 --> 00:32:52.919 align:start position:0%
plus years
 
00:32:57.430 --> 00:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
and uh Most states use the Cooper test
 
00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:02.100 align:start position:0%
battery for police officer training
 
00:33:05.029 --> 00:33:05.039 align:start position:0%
but there is a trend right now to
 
00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:08.460 align:start position:0%
revisit the use of these uh tests this
 
00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:11.820 align:start position:0%
test battery and uh
 
00:33:15.289 --> 00:33:15.299 align:start position:0%
move to a more job-related job-specific
 
00:33:18.789 --> 00:33:18.799 align:start position:0%
test uh to that end
 
00:33:21.409 --> 00:33:21.419 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we're trying to
 
00:33:24.049 --> 00:33:24.059 align:start position:0%
accomplish through this committee is to
 
00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:25.500 align:start position:0%
look at some of the other available
 
00:33:27.889 --> 00:33:27.899 align:start position:0%
tests that are out there that would be
 
00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
more job specific with a single cut
 
00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
regardless of age or gender as other
 
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
people have testified to the test we use
 
00:33:39.169 --> 00:33:39.179 align:start position:0%
now is age and gender normed
 
00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:41.940 align:start position:0%
and uh that means that there are
 
00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:44.820 align:start position:0%
different standards for different age
 
00:33:47.389 --> 00:33:47.399 align:start position:0%
groups and and different genders as they
 
00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:54.289 --> 00:33:54.299 align:start position:0%
really we um at this point we take no
 
00:33:56.570 --> 00:33:56.580 align:start position:0%
position on this but we do think that
 
00:33:59.269 --> 00:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
the notion of uh Wellness over the
 
00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:00.720 align:start position:0%
course of the officer's career is
 
00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:01.850 align:start position:0%
course of the officer's career is
important

00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:01.860 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:05.220 align:start position:0%
uh how we get there uh certainly uh
 
00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
there's many many avenues that we can
 
00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:09.720 align:start position:0%
take to get there uh the only other
 
00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:11.820 align:start position:0%
thing that I would point out is that
 
00:34:17.169 --> 00:34:17.179 align:start position:0%
this bill as proposed does not address
 
00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:20.700 align:start position:0%
some sections of this bill that speaks
 
00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:23.700 align:start position:0%
to the medical exam requirement
 
00:34:27.829 --> 00:34:27.839 align:start position:0%
prior to the incumbent officer taking
 
00:34:31.490 --> 00:34:31.500 align:start position:0%
this three-year fitness test there is a
 
00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
number of sections that refers to an
 
00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:36.540 align:start position:0%
officer having to be cleared medically
 
00:34:39.829 --> 00:34:39.839 align:start position:0%
by their their medical provider
 
00:34:42.889 --> 00:34:42.899 align:start position:0%
to demonstrate that they're either able
 
00:34:46.010 --> 00:34:46.020 align:start position:0%
to or not able to take this particular
 
00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:47.329 align:start position:0%
to or not able to take this particular
exam

00:34:47.329 --> 00:34:47.339 align:start position:0%
exam
 
00:34:49.849 --> 00:34:49.859 align:start position:0%
we don't ask for medical information we
 
00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:51.720 align:start position:0%
just asked the doctor to sign off saying
 
00:34:53.210 --> 00:34:53.220 align:start position:0%
that they can either take it or not take
 
00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
it and so if this bill were to move
 
00:35:00.349 --> 00:35:00.359 align:start position:0%
forward I would certainly ask that uh
 
00:35:03.589 --> 00:35:03.599 align:start position:0%
this committee look at kind of those
 
00:35:05.210 --> 00:35:05.220 align:start position:0%
those other sections to make sure that
 
00:35:06.650 --> 00:35:06.660 align:start position:0%
they're in line
 
00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
I certainly stand ready to answer any
 
00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:11.700 align:start position:0%
questions that anyone might have
 
00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:15.660 align:start position:0%
thank you and hearing the testimony I I
 
00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:17.160 align:start position:0%
understand that it's possible for
 
00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:18.900 align:start position:0%
individual agencies to put their own
 
00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
wordless bill to pass to put their own
 
00:35:22.970 --> 00:35:22.980 align:start position:0%
incentive programs in place for officers
 
00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:25.320 align:start position:0%
to maintain Fitness but my sticking
 
00:35:27.589 --> 00:35:27.599 align:start position:0%
point still seems to be that the state
 
00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:30.300 align:start position:0%
is on the hook for paying for retirement
 
00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
for injured officers regardless of what
 
00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
individual agencies do the whole state
 
00:35:37.730 --> 00:35:37.740 align:start position:0%
has to pick up the tab could you speak
 
00:35:39.829 --> 00:35:39.839 align:start position:0%
to that in any in any way
 
00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
you know certainly that's an excellent
 
00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:45.780 align:start position:0%
question certainly uh sir the uh a lot
 
00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
of agencies
 
00:35:49.849 --> 00:35:49.859 align:start position:0%
have their own in-house fitness program
 
00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
many agencies have no fitness program at
 
00:35:55.730 --> 00:35:55.740 align:start position:0%
all and uh
 
00:35:58.370 --> 00:35:58.380 align:start position:0%
some agencies use incentives
 
00:36:00.589 --> 00:36:00.599 align:start position:0%
uh so if the officer is able to pass
 
00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
their three-year fitness test at a at a
 
00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:04.260 align:start position:0%
higher level than what the state
 
00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
requires they're given uh maybe a bonus
 
00:36:11.450 --> 00:36:11.460 align:start position:0%
or extra time off uh a better parking
 
00:36:13.130 --> 00:36:13.140 align:start position:0%
spot I mean they they're very creative
 
00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
on how they uh you know recognize these
 
00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
officers uh if an officer is injured
 
00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
during the course of their Duty
 
00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:25.260 align:start position:0%
then as testified to already you know
 
00:36:27.290 --> 00:36:27.300 align:start position:0%
certainly the officer may be available
 
00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:31.140 align:start position:0%
to a a disability retirement
 
00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:33.950 align:start position:0%
to a a disability retirement
um

00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
and I don't know it's I don't know that
 
00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:40.260 align:start position:0%
it's been tested yet or not but Chief
 
00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:43.260 align:start position:0%
drolet did speak to the notion that if
 
00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:46.200 align:start position:0%
an officer is off duty working towards
 
00:36:48.589 --> 00:36:48.599 align:start position:0%
uh taking their PT tests they're at
 
00:36:50.210 --> 00:36:50.220 align:start position:0%
Planet Fitness or they're out for a run
 
00:36:52.370 --> 00:36:52.380 align:start position:0%
and they get injured is there some kind
 
00:36:56.089 --> 00:36:56.099 align:start position:0%
of Nexus between uh this this injury
 
00:36:58.370 --> 00:36:58.380 align:start position:0%
being a job related injury
 
00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:01.740 align:start position:0%
uh I will say that under the law as it
 
00:37:04.609 --> 00:37:04.619 align:start position:0%
presently exists the relationship to
 
00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
maintain the officer's certification is
 
00:37:10.069 --> 00:37:10.079 align:start position:0%
between the officer and police standards
 
00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:11.880 align:start position:0%
and training right now so it does not
 
00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
involve the agency per se it would be a
 
00:37:18.829 --> 00:37:18.839 align:start position:0%
lot like uh and a long long time ago I I
 
00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:21.480 align:start position:0%
worked as a paramedic and it was the
 
00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:23.700 align:start position:0%
paramedics responsibility to maintain
 
00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:27.420 align:start position:0%
their paramedic license uh and generally
 
00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
speaking it was not the uh the agency
 
00:37:32.690 --> 00:37:32.700 align:start position:0%
that you worked for although a lot of
 
00:37:35.089 --> 00:37:35.099 align:start position:0%
agencies helped out it really wasn't the
 
00:37:37.849 --> 00:37:37.859 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the agency to take on
 
00:37:41.450 --> 00:37:41.460 align:start position:0%
a part of that relationship so it does
 
00:37:43.609 --> 00:37:43.619 align:start position:0%
place the
 
00:37:43.619 --> 00:37:45.290 align:start position:0%
place the
um

00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:45.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:47.569 --> 00:37:47.579 align:start position:0%
kind of the responsibility on each
 
00:37:50.329 --> 00:37:50.339 align:start position:0%
individual officer for them to maintain
 
00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:52.380 align:start position:0%
their level of Fitness so that they can
 
00:37:55.010 --> 00:37:55.020 align:start position:0%
maintain their license or certification
 
00:37:58.190 --> 00:37:58.200 align:start position:0%
to work as a police officer
 
00:38:00.349 --> 00:38:00.359 align:start position:0%
and so it sounds like to me that there's
 
00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:03.720 align:start position:0%
a different responsibility chain with
 
00:38:06.410 --> 00:38:06.420 align:start position:0%
different people responsible at the end
 
00:38:08.569 --> 00:38:08.579 align:start position:0%
but at the end of the day it's still the
 
00:38:10.010 --> 00:38:10.020 align:start position:0%
retirement system that would bear the
 
00:38:12.349 --> 00:38:12.359 align:start position:0%
burden if an officer is injured on duty
 
00:38:15.109 --> 00:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
so the officer reports to or deals with
 
00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
your agency to pass their physical
 
00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
fitness tests the department May
 
00:38:20.770 --> 00:38:20.780 align:start position:0%
incentivize it may not
 
00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
but at the end of the day if there's an
 
00:38:25.609 --> 00:38:25.619 align:start position:0%
injury because an officer isn't fit and
 
00:38:28.310 --> 00:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
and gets hurt it's the State Retirement
 
00:38:29.930 --> 00:38:29.940 align:start position:0%
Board that has to pick that up so I
 
00:38:31.730 --> 00:38:31.740 align:start position:0%
guess my question is has anyone studied
 
00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:33.839 align:start position:0%
the difference since this law went into
 
00:38:37.130 --> 00:38:37.140 align:start position:0%
effect in the number of people who put
 
00:38:38.690 --> 00:38:38.700 align:start position:0%
in for disability retirement versus
 
00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:40.260 align:start position:0%
before that
 
00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
that is an excellent question sir and
 
00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:45.720 align:start position:0%
that is a question that we keep coming
 
00:38:48.410 --> 00:38:48.420 align:start position:0%
back to uh
 
00:38:51.770 --> 00:38:51.780 align:start position:0%
when this law was put into place in 2001
 
00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
there was no uh data collection
 
00:38:57.349 --> 00:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
that helped
 
00:39:00.589 --> 00:39:00.599 align:start position:0%
demonstrate over the period of time
 
00:39:04.490 --> 00:39:04.500 align:start position:0%
as to whether this law prevented reduced
 
00:39:07.370 --> 00:39:07.380 align:start position:0%
mitigated any type of worker comp claims
 
00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:10.490 align:start position:0%
mitigated any type of worker comp claims
further

00:39:10.490 --> 00:39:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:14.810 --> 00:39:14.820 align:start position:0%
I cannot with any veracity speak to how
 
00:39:18.109 --> 00:39:18.119 align:start position:0%
many officers we actually lose because
 
00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
they can't pass a fitness test and and
 
00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:22.260 align:start position:0%
the reason that we cannot speak to that
 
00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
is because
 
00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:25.430 align:start position:0%
is because
uh

00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:39:28.970 --> 00:39:28.980 align:start position:0%
I can I can tell you that anecdotally
 
00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:31.260 align:start position:0%
we lose about four a year that actually
 
00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
come in front of the council and they
 
00:39:35.089 --> 00:39:35.099 align:start position:0%
say hey I can't pass I've already gotten
 
00:39:38.329 --> 00:39:38.339 align:start position:0%
my four waivers or three waivers at six
 
00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:40.380 align:start position:0%
month increments to get me to five years
 
00:39:44.089 --> 00:39:44.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:46.609 --> 00:39:46.619 align:start position:0%
what we don't know is we have a number
 
00:39:48.530 --> 00:39:48.540 align:start position:0%
of people who retire
 
00:39:51.650 --> 00:39:51.660 align:start position:0%
and they retire uh having made the the
 
00:39:53.569 --> 00:39:53.579 align:start position:0%
their age
 
00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh and their time and service so it's a
 
00:39:57.950 --> 00:39:57.960 align:start position:0%
normal retirement we recognize it as a
 
00:40:00.349 --> 00:40:00.359 align:start position:0%
normal retirement but what we don't know
 
00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:02.700 align:start position:0%
what we don't ask is are you retiring
 
00:40:04.310 --> 00:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
because you've gotten to that place
 
00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:05.880 align:start position:0%
where you can't pass your fitness test
 
00:40:07.130 --> 00:40:07.140 align:start position:0%
any longer
 
00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
and uh so it's it's a it's a moving
 
00:40:14.569 --> 00:40:14.579 align:start position:0%
Target I cannot tell you how effective
 
00:40:15.770 --> 00:40:15.780 align:start position:0%
this program
 
00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:19.980 align:start position:0%
has been over the last 23 years I cannot
 
00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
tell you how many times this program has
 
00:40:25.310 --> 00:40:25.320 align:start position:0%
helped identify an underlying medical
 
00:40:27.109 --> 00:40:27.119 align:start position:0%
issue that an officer had that they
 
00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
didn't know they had until they got a
 
00:40:33.470 --> 00:40:33.480 align:start position:0%
medical exam I cannot tell you
 
00:40:35.810 --> 00:40:35.820 align:start position:0%
um what we cannot with any veracity
 
00:40:37.790 --> 00:40:37.800 align:start position:0%
answer any of those questions and
 
00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:42.060 align:start position:0%
ironically uh it's serendipitous or kind
 
00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
of ironic that I'm here uh I was the
 
00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:47.160 align:start position:0%
training specialist in charge of rolling
 
00:40:49.970 --> 00:40:49.980 align:start position:0%
this program out in 2001 when it went
 
00:40:54.290 --> 00:40:54.300 align:start position:0%
online and uh Chief obeki was was uh
 
00:40:57.170 --> 00:40:57.180 align:start position:0%
part of that first group uh that that
 
00:40:59.390 --> 00:40:59.400 align:start position:0%
kind of fell under these new
 
00:41:02.510 --> 00:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
requirements so I I literally have been
 
00:41:04.450 --> 00:41:04.460 align:start position:0%
here since the Inception of this program
 
00:41:07.810 --> 00:41:07.820 align:start position:0%
and as we were preparing to speak today
 
00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:11.640 align:start position:0%
uh and really the work we've done at a
 
00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:12.660 align:start position:0%
subcommittee you know these questions
 
00:41:14.690 --> 00:41:14.700 align:start position:0%
have already come up and we just can't
 
00:41:16.130 --> 00:41:16.140 align:start position:0%
answer them because we've never
 
00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:19.020 align:start position:0%
collected any data or there was no way
 
00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:21.720 align:start position:0%
to collect that data
 
00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
sounds like you may be passing the
 
00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittee pot here
 
00:41:28.730 --> 00:41:28.740 align:start position:0%
any further any questions representative
 
00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:32.390 align:start position:0%
any further any questions representative
Newman

00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:36.370 --> 00:41:36.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:38.089 --> 00:41:38.099 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:41:38.099 --> 00:41:38.750 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:42.829 --> 00:41:42.839 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if uh a legislative change
 
00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:46.020 align:start position:0%
would be required in order to make the
 
00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:48.780 align:start position:0%
program more Wellness focused like
 
00:41:51.770 --> 00:41:51.780 align:start position:0%
you've talked about it seems like
 
00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:52.370 align:start position:0%
you've talked about it seems like
um

00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:52.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
having an officer you know capable of
 
00:41:58.970 --> 00:41:58.980 align:start position:0%
running 1.5 miles under a certain time
 
00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:02.220 align:start position:0%
doesn't do you much good if um the next
 
00:42:03.770 --> 00:42:03.780 align:start position:0%
time the officer does it their
 
00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
cholesterol level is so high that they
 
00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
might have a heart attack and that's
 
00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:09.960 align:start position:0%
something that you would have no
 
00:42:12.109 --> 00:42:12.119 align:start position:0%
knowledge of unless you were getting
 
00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:16.160 align:start position:0%
some sort of a regular biometric test so
 
00:42:19.849 --> 00:42:19.859 align:start position:0%
one of the things I'm I'm really curious
 
00:42:23.089 --> 00:42:23.099 align:start position:0%
about is whether this is something we
 
00:42:24.650 --> 00:42:24.660 align:start position:0%
could evolve into something that would
 
00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
be more useful for everybody as opposed
 
00:42:30.410 --> 00:42:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:33.609 --> 00:42:33.619 align:start position:0%
uh thank you very much for uh for that
 
00:42:37.310 --> 00:42:37.320 align:start position:0%
and in fact uh we feel exactly the same
 
00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
way the police academy feels exactly the
 
00:42:42.050 --> 00:42:42.060 align:start position:0%
same way uh
 
00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:45.240 align:start position:0%
candidly under existing statute the New
 
00:42:46.550 --> 00:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire police standards and training
 
00:42:50.210 --> 00:42:50.220 align:start position:0%
Council has the statutory authority to
 
00:42:52.849 --> 00:42:52.859 align:start position:0%
set the fitness standards the hiring
 
00:42:55.790 --> 00:42:55.800 align:start position:0%
standards and so really
 
00:42:58.849 --> 00:42:58.859 align:start position:0%
if given the opportunity to continue
 
00:43:01.550 --> 00:43:01.560 align:start position:0%
working with the stakeholders New
 
00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Chiefs New Hampshire Police
 
00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
Association uh you know those folks that
 
00:43:09.650 --> 00:43:09.660 align:start position:0%
are going to be involved uh
 
00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
I believe that we would have uh the
 
00:43:15.470 --> 00:43:15.480 align:start position:0%
ability to work towards something that
 
00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:18.780 align:start position:0%
is certainly more job related
 
00:43:22.030 --> 00:43:22.040 align:start position:0%
would more greatly support to your point
 
00:43:24.770 --> 00:43:24.780 align:start position:0%
officer wellness and build officer
 
00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
resiliency to help them throughout their
 
00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
career but I I do concur with that
 
00:43:34.210 --> 00:43:34.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:40.010 --> 00:43:40.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:43:41.809 --> 00:43:41.819 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
um I was just going to ask I know you
 
00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
didn't come in with an official
 
00:43:46.130 --> 00:43:46.140 align:start position:0%
recommendation but based on that last
 
00:43:48.530 --> 00:43:48.540 align:start position:0%
question would it be more amenable to
 
00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:51.240 align:start position:0%
like retain the bill or study it further
 
00:43:53.870 --> 00:43:53.880 align:start position:0%
or just ital it and let you guys kind of
 
00:43:56.089 --> 00:43:56.099 align:start position:0%
come next year with a better idea of
 
00:43:57.290 --> 00:43:57.300 align:start position:0%
what you would want to change the
 
00:43:59.829 --> 00:43:59.839 align:start position:0%
testing standards to
 
00:44:01.849 --> 00:44:01.859 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the the
 
00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity to weigh in on that
 
00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:07.190 align:start position:0%
opportunity to weigh in on that
um I

00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
um I
 
00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
I don't know I don't want to speak
 
00:44:10.550 --> 00:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
there's there's a number of stakeholders
 
00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:12.180 align:start position:0%
here in the room and I I don't want to
 
00:44:14.809 --> 00:44:14.819 align:start position:0%
speak unilaterally to that uh I think
 
00:44:17.089 --> 00:44:17.099 align:start position:0%
given the opportunity however this
 
00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
committee sees fit to provide that
 
00:44:21.770 --> 00:44:21.780 align:start position:0%
opportunity uh might be the best the
 
00:44:24.050 --> 00:44:24.060 align:start position:0%
best approach and we may be able to do
 
00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
this as representative Muse mentioned
 
00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
without legislation but instead working
 
00:44:30.650 --> 00:44:30.660 align:start position:0%
with uh with the stakeholders and the
 
00:44:34.010 --> 00:44:34.020 align:start position:0%
council to to come to some kind of a you
 
00:44:36.290 --> 00:44:36.300 align:start position:0%
know a better system
 
00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:39.470 align:start position:0%
know a better system
representative

00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:43.910 align:start position:0%
taking the question
uh

00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:44:46.490 --> 00:44:46.500 align:start position:0%
if a police officer who's working with
 
00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
the agency reaches that three-year time
 
00:44:52.010 --> 00:44:52.020 align:start position:0%
period does the does the council or the
 
00:44:56.329 --> 00:44:56.339 align:start position:0%
academy offer uh workout time with a
 
00:44:58.910 --> 00:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
personal trainer and if they've failed
 
00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
do they offer that as an option to come
 
00:45:04.069 --> 00:45:04.079 align:start position:0%
to the academy for say a resident period
 
00:45:06.530 --> 00:45:06.540 align:start position:0%
of one week to to work on remedial
 
00:45:08.210 --> 00:45:08.220 align:start position:0%
physical training
 
00:45:10.250 --> 00:45:10.260 align:start position:0%
uh thank you very much for that question
 
00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh presently we do not uh we do not
 
00:45:16.910 --> 00:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
offer any type of uh remedial or support
 
00:45:20.690 --> 00:45:20.700 align:start position:0%
training for those folks who uh do not
 
00:45:24.109 --> 00:45:24.119 align:start position:0%
pass the test I will say that uh the
 
00:45:25.809 --> 00:45:25.819 align:start position:0%
captain who's sitting next to me has
 
00:45:29.569 --> 00:45:29.579 align:start position:0%
advocated for trying to create that kind
 
00:45:32.750 --> 00:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
of a program again in
 
00:45:35.690 --> 00:45:35.700 align:start position:0%
with a notion of supporting Wellness so
 
00:45:38.270 --> 00:45:38.280 align:start position:0%
that is uh that has been part of the
 
00:45:39.890 --> 00:45:39.900 align:start position:0%
discussion but presently that does not
 
00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:43.190 align:start position:0%
discussion but presently that does not
exist

00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:46.430 --> 00:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
um is there any ability uh how to hire
 
00:45:53.329 --> 00:45:53.339 align:start position:0%
retired officers and police departments
 
00:45:55.849 --> 00:45:55.859 align:start position:0%
and if so how how does that apply and
 
00:45:58.190 --> 00:45:58.200 align:start position:0%
how do physical fitness apply to that
 
00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
and I'm just thinking about Staffing
 
00:46:03.170 --> 00:46:03.180 align:start position:0%
kind of things yes uh thank you for the
 
00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:06.230 align:start position:0%
kind of things yes uh thank you for the
question

00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:09.290 --> 00:46:09.300 align:start position:0%
there are a small group of police
 
00:46:11.870 --> 00:46:11.880 align:start position:0%
officers that were grandfathered
 
00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
and are not required to take this test
 
00:46:17.089 --> 00:46:17.099 align:start position:0%
and those those officers had 10 years of
 
00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
service invested continuous service
 
00:46:22.490 --> 00:46:22.500 align:start position:0%
prior to 2001.
 
00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
uh that there's probably about 200 total
 
00:46:29.870 --> 00:46:29.880 align:start position:0%
officers in out of the 4 000 that we
 
00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
have that still fall under that
 
00:46:34.430 --> 00:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
grandfathered section
 
00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:36.470 align:start position:0%
grandfathered section
uh

00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:46:40.609 --> 00:46:40.619 align:start position:0%
if uh a retired officer wants to come
 
00:46:40.619 --> 00:46:41.510 align:start position:0%
if uh a retired officer wants to come
back

00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
and they fall under that very small
 
00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:47.640 align:start position:0%
group they're not required to to
 
00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
then be required to take the fitness
 
00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:50.990 align:start position:0%
then be required to take the fitness
test

00:46:50.990 --> 00:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
test
 
00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:52.970 align:start position:0%
test
uh

00:46:52.970 --> 00:46:52.980 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:46:57.829 --> 00:46:57.839 align:start position:0%
anybody who was required under the law
 
00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
that began in 2001 even if they retired
 
00:47:03.530 --> 00:47:03.540 align:start position:0%
and then came back they would they would
 
00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:05.880 align:start position:0%
come back under the requirements to take
 
00:47:10.370 --> 00:47:10.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:12.770 --> 00:47:12.780 align:start position:0%
so for the for the new group now that is
 
00:47:15.290 --> 00:47:15.300 align:start position:0%
not grandfathered and they have the
 
00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to work without without with
 
00:47:19.790 --> 00:47:19.800 align:start position:0%
the test
 
00:47:21.890 --> 00:47:21.900 align:start position:0%
um how does that work do they get their
 
00:47:25.250 --> 00:47:25.260 align:start position:0%
their retired pay in in some amount of
 
00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
money how does that work oh thank you
 
00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
for that question I'm sorry uh so uh if
 
00:47:33.589 --> 00:47:33.599 align:start position:0%
a retired police officer who is drawing
 
00:47:36.290 --> 00:47:36.300 align:start position:0%
retirement comes back as a part-time
 
00:47:39.170 --> 00:47:39.180 align:start position:0%
police officer they're allowed to work
 
00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
part-time up to I believe it's
 
00:47:45.349 --> 00:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
1350 hours
 
00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
per year the hiring Authority has to
 
00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:49.609 align:start position:0%
per year the hiring Authority has to
report

00:47:49.609 --> 00:47:49.619 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:47:51.710 --> 00:47:51.720 align:start position:0%
the number of actual hours that that
 
00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:53.150 align:start position:0%
the number of actual hours that that
retired

00:47:53.150 --> 00:47:53.160 align:start position:0%
retired
 
00:47:55.550 --> 00:47:55.560 align:start position:0%
part-time police officer is working they
 
00:47:58.849 --> 00:47:58.859 align:start position:0%
have to report that to us and there are
 
00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
some uh certain uh penalties that can be
 
00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
imposed by New Hampshire retirement if a
 
00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
retiree Works Beyond those number of
 
00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
hours in any given year
 
00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
uh they can come back full time but when
 
00:48:16.430 --> 00:48:16.440 align:start position:0%
they come back full time they stop
 
00:48:19.010 --> 00:48:19.020 align:start position:0%
drawing their retirement and then they
 
00:48:21.710 --> 00:48:21.720 align:start position:0%
are now an active uh member of the
 
00:48:23.329 --> 00:48:23.339 align:start position:0%
retirement system and they continue to
 
00:48:25.250 --> 00:48:25.260 align:start position:0%
pay in
 
00:48:27.890 --> 00:48:27.900 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
00:48:29.930 --> 00:48:29.940 align:start position:0%
um final question is there any
 
00:48:32.390 --> 00:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
restriction on new officers um with
 
00:48:34.490 --> 00:48:34.500 align:start position:0%
things like tobacco use or anything like
 
00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:35.809 align:start position:0%
things like tobacco use or anything like
that

00:48:35.809 --> 00:48:35.819 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:48:39.530 --> 00:48:39.540 align:start position:0%
we uh uh we are not like Massachusetts
 
00:48:41.630 --> 00:48:41.640 align:start position:0%
uh Massachusetts Massachusetts and I was
 
00:48:43.069 --> 00:48:43.079 align:start position:0%
a director of a police academy in
 
00:48:44.809 --> 00:48:44.819 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts so I can speak
 
00:48:48.050 --> 00:48:48.060 align:start position:0%
pretty accurately on differences between
 
00:48:52.370 --> 00:48:52.380 align:start position:0%
the two states uh New Hampshire does not
 
00:48:55.910 --> 00:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
require police officers to in essence
 
00:48:58.309 --> 00:48:58.319 align:start position:0%
sign an affidavit saying that they do
 
00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
not use tobacco products uh nor is there
 
00:49:03.950 --> 00:49:03.960 align:start position:0%
a penalty here in New Hampshire for a
 
00:49:05.630 --> 00:49:05.640 align:start position:0%
police officer that uses tobacco
 
00:49:09.410 --> 00:49:09.420 align:start position:0%
products in Massachusetts uh that does
 
00:49:13.069 --> 00:49:13.079 align:start position:0%
exist you as a public police employee
 
00:49:15.470 --> 00:49:15.480 align:start position:0%
you cannot use tobacco in the state of
 
00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:16.550 align:start position:0%
you cannot use tobacco in the state of
Massachusetts

00:49:16.550 --> 00:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
00:49:18.410 --> 00:49:18.420 align:start position:0%
and it's my understanding that was
 
00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
established to protect the retirement
 
00:49:21.890 --> 00:49:21.900 align:start position:0%
system is that correct that is
 
00:49:24.829 --> 00:49:24.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:26.089 --> 00:49:26.099 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your testimony this
 
00:49:26.099 --> 00:49:27.050 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your testimony this
morning

00:49:27.050 --> 00:49:27.060 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:49:30.109 --> 00:49:30.119 align:start position:0%
thank you what oh I'm sorry I didn't see
 
00:49:39.950 --> 00:49:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:42.890 --> 00:49:42.900 align:start position:0%
like the national certification
 
00:49:46.490 --> 00:49:46.500 align:start position:0%
I I'm sorry madam uh the national
 
00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
certification like Nashua I think
 
00:49:50.569 --> 00:49:50.579 align:start position:0%
Hollows they have a national
 
00:49:53.809 --> 00:49:53.819 align:start position:0%
certification yeah Prudential
 
00:49:56.089 --> 00:49:56.099 align:start position:0%
accreditation right yes oh thank you
 
00:49:58.730 --> 00:49:58.740 align:start position:0%
thank that affect this uh I I don't
 
00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
believe so Madam because uh it is my
 
00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
understanding that uh for those agencies
 
00:50:06.890 --> 00:50:06.900 align:start position:0%
to reach national accreditation through
 
00:50:09.530 --> 00:50:09.540 align:start position:0%
Kalia which is the organization that
 
00:50:11.890 --> 00:50:11.900 align:start position:0%
that oversees that accreditation process
 
00:50:15.829 --> 00:50:15.839 align:start position:0%
uh irregardless of uh what standards may
 
00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
or may not exist in the state those
 
00:50:20.630 --> 00:50:20.640 align:start position:0%
agencies have to meet the Kalia
 
00:50:22.309 --> 00:50:22.319 align:start position:0%
standards in order to get that Kalia
 
00:50:25.309 --> 00:50:25.319 align:start position:0%
stamp of approval so uh if there was any
 
00:50:27.109 --> 00:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
kind of clear standard relative to
 
00:50:30.050 --> 00:50:30.060 align:start position:0%
Fitness uh that agency would take it
 
00:50:33.050 --> 00:50:33.060 align:start position:0%
upon themselves to to uh meet those
 
00:50:35.329 --> 00:50:35.339 align:start position:0%
requirements and it would not impact if
 
00:50:38.750 --> 00:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
if any action was taken here thank you
 
00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:41.160 align:start position:0%
and that raises yet one more last
 
00:50:43.550 --> 00:50:43.560 align:start position:0%
question for me I understand that there
 
00:50:46.010 --> 00:50:46.020 align:start position:0%
is potentially some State Standards
 
00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
being worked on at the moment
 
00:50:49.549 --> 00:50:49.559 align:start position:0%
are any of those standards involve
 
00:50:51.049 --> 00:50:51.059 align:start position:0%
physical fitness
 
00:50:53.450 --> 00:50:53.460 align:start position:0%
I thank you for the question I did not
 
00:50:57.290 --> 00:50:57.300 align:start position:0%
see any I I know that there's a uh Chief
 
00:50:59.510 --> 00:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
obec yeah chief o Becky sits on that
 
00:51:02.450 --> 00:51:02.460 align:start position:0%
committee as well and and there are no
 
00:51:04.130 --> 00:51:04.140 align:start position:0%
Fitness standards within a state level
 
00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:07.020 align:start position:0%
accreditation as we're building it thank
 
00:51:10.849 --> 00:51:10.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:13.790 --> 00:51:13.800 align:start position:0%
I I stand corrected there is a wellness
 
00:51:16.849 --> 00:51:16.859 align:start position:0%
piece but not a not specific to a
 
00:51:18.890 --> 00:51:18.900 align:start position:0%
fitness test
 
00:51:21.109 --> 00:51:21.119 align:start position:0%
so that the the agency has to
 
00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that they have a wellness
 
00:51:25.250 --> 00:51:25.260 align:start position:0%
policy in place and a wellness program
 
00:51:27.530 --> 00:51:27.540 align:start position:0%
and that may or may not include a
 
00:51:29.329 --> 00:51:29.339 align:start position:0%
physical fitness aspect that is correct
 
00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
sir okay thank you thank you for your
 
00:51:34.490 --> 00:51:34.500 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you the chair recognizes
 
00:51:52.809 --> 00:51:52.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:56.450 --> 00:51:56.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:51:56.460 --> 00:51:57.950 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
I

00:51:57.950 --> 00:51:57.960 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:51:59.690 --> 00:51:59.700 align:start position:0%
um and members of the committee I
 
00:52:03.290 --> 00:52:03.300 align:start position:0%
apologize for my tardiness
 
00:52:04.970 --> 00:52:04.980 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:52:08.210 --> 00:52:08.220 align:start position:0%
um it's tough when you get stuck behind
 
00:52:12.349 --> 00:52:12.359 align:start position:0%
a truck on when on Route 9 coming from
 
00:52:14.329 --> 00:52:14.339 align:start position:0%
Hinsdale to
 
00:52:14.339 --> 00:52:17.390 align:start position:0%
Hinsdale to
Concord

00:52:17.390 --> 00:52:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:27.490 --> 00:52:27.500 align:start position:0%
if I'm being redundant and
 
00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
testimony that was given before my
 
00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:32.510 align:start position:0%
testimony that was given before my
arrival

00:52:32.510 --> 00:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
arrival
 
00:52:34.370 --> 00:52:34.380 align:start position:0%
the reason why
 
00:52:38.030 --> 00:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
I sponsored this piece of legislation
 
00:52:40.730 --> 00:52:40.740 align:start position:0%
it was brought to my attention
 
00:52:44.990 --> 00:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
the difficulty that
 
00:52:49.490 --> 00:52:49.500 align:start position:0%
rural police departments have in
 
00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:58.250 align:start position:0%
 
officers

00:52:58.250 --> 00:52:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:58.260 --> 00:52:59.930 align:start position:0%
 
under

00:52:59.930 --> 00:52:59.940 align:start position:0%
under
 
00:52:59.940 --> 00:53:03.049 align:start position:0%
under
this

00:53:03.049 --> 00:53:03.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:09.049 --> 00:53:09.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:09.059 --> 00:53:10.609 align:start position:0%
 
as

00:53:10.609 --> 00:53:10.619 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:53:13.250 --> 00:53:13.260 align:start position:0%
you might have heard
 
00:53:15.710 --> 00:53:15.720 align:start position:0%
there's police officers are the only
 
00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:16.910 align:start position:0%
there's police officers are the only
ones

00:53:16.910 --> 00:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
ones
 
00:53:20.210 --> 00:53:20.220 align:start position:0%
who are required to take this physical
 
00:53:20.220 --> 00:53:22.370 align:start position:0%
who are required to take this physical
examination

00:53:22.370 --> 00:53:22.380 align:start position:0%
examination
 
00:53:24.410 --> 00:53:24.420 align:start position:0%
we don't require it
 
00:53:27.589 --> 00:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:31.730 --> 00:53:31.740 align:start position:0%
so I think you can imagine the state we
 
00:53:33.049 --> 00:53:33.059 align:start position:0%
would be in
 
00:53:38.809 --> 00:53:38.819 align:start position:0%
if the rural small area
 
00:53:42.970 --> 00:53:42.980 align:start position:0%
fire departments were to require
 
00:53:47.690 --> 00:53:47.700 align:start position:0%
this type of physical exam
 
00:53:49.849 --> 00:53:49.859 align:start position:0%
and I don't think
 
00:53:52.790 --> 00:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
based on the nature of their work
 
00:54:00.349 --> 00:54:00.359 align:start position:0%
that it that a fireman
 
00:54:00.359 --> 00:54:01.190 align:start position:0%
that it that a fireman
um

00:54:01.190 --> 00:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:03.829 --> 00:54:03.839 align:start position:0%
as a less strenuous
 
00:54:06.349 --> 00:54:06.359 align:start position:0%
type of position
 
00:54:06.359 --> 00:54:08.870 align:start position:0%
type of position
in

00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:54:11.329 --> 00:54:11.339 align:start position:0%
I think you can well imagine
 
00:54:14.750 --> 00:54:14.760 align:start position:0%
what the state of our volunteer fire
 
00:54:17.569 --> 00:54:17.579 align:start position:0%
departments would be if we had such a
 
00:54:17.579 --> 00:54:23.450 align:start position:0%
departments would be if we had such a
requirement

00:54:23.450 --> 00:54:23.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:25.790 --> 00:54:25.800 align:start position:0%
and I don't think
 
00:54:28.010 --> 00:54:28.020 align:start position:0%
if you
 
00:54:30.410 --> 00:54:30.420 align:start position:0%
have questioned
 
00:54:33.049 --> 00:54:33.059 align:start position:0%
some of the police Chiefs
 
00:54:33.059 --> 00:54:34.970 align:start position:0%
some of the police Chiefs
about

00:54:34.970 --> 00:54:34.980 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:54:38.089 --> 00:54:38.099 align:start position:0%
the actual practice
 
00:54:38.099 --> 00:54:39.609 align:start position:0%
the actual practice
of

00:54:39.609 --> 00:54:39.619 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:54:41.809 --> 00:54:41.819 align:start position:0%
these exams
 
00:54:45.410 --> 00:54:45.420 align:start position:0%
fits into what their
 
00:54:48.470 --> 00:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
Duties are
 
00:54:52.910 --> 00:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
I don't think you would find many police
 
00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:54.230 align:start position:0%
I don't think you would find many police
officers

00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
officers
 
00:54:57.530 --> 00:54:57.540 align:start position:0%
who in their entire career
 
00:55:02.870 --> 00:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:03.530 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:55:03.530 --> 00:55:03.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:05.270 --> 00:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
and I think
 
00:55:08.089 --> 00:55:08.099 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:55:11.089 --> 00:55:11.099 align:start position:0%
a matter of local control
 
00:55:15.049 --> 00:55:15.059 align:start position:0%
like planning and zoning
 
00:55:19.609 --> 00:55:19.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:23.630 --> 00:55:23.640 align:start position:0%
local departments from having their own
 
00:55:25.490 --> 00:55:25.500 align:start position:0%
physical standards
 
00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:27.530 align:start position:0%
physical standards
and

00:55:27.530 --> 00:55:27.540 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:55:32.150 --> 00:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
in order to stay satisfied certified
 
00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:34.549 align:start position:0%
in order to stay satisfied certified
um

00:55:34.549 --> 00:55:34.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:38.990 --> 00:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
and I think it should be not something
 
00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:41.270 align:start position:0%
and I think it should be not something
um

00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:44.990 --> 00:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
going back to the Chairman's
 
00:55:48.890 --> 00:55:48.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:53.210 --> 00:55:53.220 align:start position:0%
physical or unemployment
 
00:55:56.329 --> 00:55:56.339 align:start position:0%
comp workman's compensation for this
 
00:55:59.270 --> 00:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
this is not a
 
00:56:01.549 --> 00:56:01.559 align:start position:0%
I think a duty
 
00:56:05.690 --> 00:56:05.700 align:start position:0%
that the state should be involved in
 
00:56:07.970 --> 00:56:07.980 align:start position:0%
then if by
 
00:56:10.730 --> 00:56:10.740 align:start position:0%
putting it under local control
 
00:56:13.490 --> 00:56:13.500 align:start position:0%
it would be up to the individual
 
00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:15.049 align:start position:0%
it would be up to the individual
departments

00:56:15.049 --> 00:56:15.059 align:start position:0%
departments
 
00:56:18.049 --> 00:56:18.059 align:start position:0%
to set the standards
 
00:56:20.329 --> 00:56:20.339 align:start position:0%
the physical standards
 
00:56:24.829 --> 00:56:24.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:29.089 --> 00:56:29.099 align:start position:0%
I've lived in Hinsdale for 52 years
 
00:56:32.750 --> 00:56:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:36.049 --> 00:56:36.059 align:start position:0%
count into double figures
 
00:56:38.809 --> 00:56:38.819 align:start position:0%
the number of police officers
 
00:56:40.549 --> 00:56:40.559 align:start position:0%
who would not
 
00:56:43.430 --> 00:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
be able to pass this physical
 
00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:45.589 align:start position:0%
be able to pass this physical
requirement

00:56:45.589 --> 00:56:45.599 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
00:56:48.410 --> 00:56:48.420 align:start position:0%
and I think it's something that the
 
00:56:50.990 --> 00:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
state shouldn't have gotten involved in
 
00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
and should remain
 
00:56:57.049 --> 00:56:57.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:58.970 --> 00:56:58.980 align:start position:0%
and I'll be
 
00:57:02.809 --> 00:57:02.819 align:start position:0%
welcome to answer any questions that
 
00:57:06.410 --> 00:57:06.420 align:start position:0%
you might have that I'm capable
 
00:57:06.420 --> 00:57:08.230 align:start position:0%
you might have that I'm capable
um

00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:08.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:11.089 --> 00:57:11.099 align:start position:0%
responding to
 
00:57:11.099 --> 00:57:14.990 align:start position:0%
responding to
foreign

00:57:14.990 --> 00:57:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:16.670 --> 00:57:16.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:57:18.349 --> 00:57:18.359 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:57:19.790 --> 00:57:19.800 align:start position:0%
um so I think you know from the people
 
00:57:21.770 --> 00:57:21.780 align:start position:0%
who we heard from before one thing that
 
00:57:23.450 --> 00:57:23.460 align:start position:0%
kind of stuck out to me was
 
00:57:25.730 --> 00:57:25.740 align:start position:0%
um a a job-based you know what I mean so
 
00:57:27.170 --> 00:57:27.180 align:start position:0%
it's it depends on kind of what your
 
00:57:29.390 --> 00:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
role is what you need to do I mean I I
 
00:57:31.309 --> 00:57:31.319 align:start position:0%
think the goal of it is to to be up to
 
00:57:32.809 --> 00:57:32.819 align:start position:0%
the job right
 
00:57:34.670 --> 00:57:34.680 align:start position:0%
um if there were things that were taken
 
00:57:36.589 --> 00:57:36.599 align:start position:0%
into consideration
 
00:57:38.450 --> 00:57:38.460 align:start position:0%
um you know what what you needed to do
 
00:57:39.890 --> 00:57:39.900 align:start position:0%
but also take it into consideration
 
00:57:42.589 --> 00:57:42.599 align:start position:0%
where you are a police officer but there
 
00:57:45.170 --> 00:57:45.180 align:start position:0%
was a standard that was adaptable
 
00:57:46.370 --> 00:57:46.380 align:start position:0%
um to different towns and things like
 
00:57:47.809 --> 00:57:47.819 align:start position:0%
that would you be amenable to something
 
00:57:50.270 --> 00:57:50.280 align:start position:0%
like that or is your goal to just get
 
00:57:52.010 --> 00:57:52.020 align:start position:0%
rid of the the Statewide standard and
 
00:57:53.210 --> 00:57:53.220 align:start position:0%
leave it on the individual
 
00:57:53.220 --> 00:57:55.849 align:start position:0%
leave it on the individual
municipalities

00:57:55.849 --> 00:57:55.859 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
00:57:58.250 --> 00:57:58.260 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for the question I think
 
00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
it should be up to the individual
 
00:58:05.150 --> 00:58:05.160 align:start position:0%
Community it's too

um I will keep this very short not
 
00:59:53.510 --> 00:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
because I have a hearing but because I
 
00:59:54.829 --> 00:59:54.839 align:start position:0%
believe that if you cannot make your
 
00:59:56.750 --> 00:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
points in two minutes you shouldn't be
 
00:59:57.829 --> 00:59:57.839 align:start position:0%
making them yes I'm Daniel

01:00:01.559 --> 01:00:03.589 align:start position:0%
Wingham
so

01:00:03.589 --> 01:00:03.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:00:05.569 --> 01:00:05.579 align:start position:0%
I want to start
 
01:00:05.579 --> 01:00:07.130 align:start position:0%
I want to start
the

01:00:07.130 --> 01:00:07.140 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:00:10.490 --> 01:00:10.500 align:start position:0%
testimony by mentioning two cases
 
01:00:14.329 --> 01:00:14.339 align:start position:0%
Catherine Johnston in Atlanta in 2006
 
01:00:19.010 --> 01:00:19.020 align:start position:0%
Jose gorenia in toxin in 2011 what they
 
01:00:21.890 --> 01:00:21.900 align:start position:0%
have in common is speaking to the reason
 
01:00:24.289 --> 01:00:24.299 align:start position:0%
why I'm in support of this bill
 
01:00:27.289 --> 01:00:27.299 align:start position:0%
which is that they ended up losing their
 
01:00:30.170 --> 01:00:30.180 align:start position:0%
lives in you know no no quarant
 
01:00:32.690 --> 01:00:32.700 align:start position:0%
scenarios and
 
01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:34.440 align:start position:0%
as you know
 
01:00:37.010 --> 01:00:37.020 align:start position:0%
I strongly believe in supporting you
 
01:00:38.750 --> 01:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
know our Public Safety our police
 
01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:40.190 align:start position:0%
know our Public Safety our police
officers

01:00:40.190 --> 01:00:40.200 align:start position:0%
officers
 
01:00:43.309 --> 01:00:43.319 align:start position:0%
but allowing them putting them in a
 
01:00:44.930 --> 01:00:44.940 align:start position:0%
situation where they they are asked to
 
01:00:46.970 --> 01:00:46.980 align:start position:0%
use every two linear toolbox to fight
 
01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
crime and then giving them tools like
 
01:00:52.190 --> 01:00:52.200 align:start position:0%
the no knock warrant puts everybody at
 
01:00:54.589 --> 01:00:54.599 align:start position:0%
risk and the reason for this is very
 
01:00:54.599 --> 01:00:56.030 align:start position:0%
risk and the reason for this is very
simple

01:00:56.030 --> 01:00:56.040 align:start position:0%
simple
 
01:00:58.549 --> 01:00:58.559 align:start position:0%
we are creating a situation where the
 
01:01:00.890 --> 01:01:00.900 align:start position:0%
homeowner has no way of knowing who is
 
01:01:03.230 --> 01:01:03.240 align:start position:0%
breaking into their homes they don't
 
01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
know it's the police they can very
 
01:01:08.329 --> 01:01:08.339 align:start position:0%
easily assume it's a home Intruder both
 
01:01:10.190 --> 01:01:10.200 align:start position:0%
of those cases have that in common the
 
01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
homeowner owner was confused they were
 
01:01:14.510 --> 01:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
not criminals they had no reason to
 
01:01:16.910 --> 01:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
expect a raid
 
01:01:19.309 --> 01:01:19.319 align:start position:0%
and they ended up in terrible situations
 
01:01:21.230 --> 01:01:21.240 align:start position:0%
and those situations are terrible for
 
01:01:23.870 --> 01:01:23.880 align:start position:0%
the police officers involved too I don't
 
01:01:26.829 --> 01:01:26.839 align:start position:0%
think anybody goes into public service
 
01:01:29.210 --> 01:01:29.220 align:start position:0%
anticipating that they may be
 
01:01:31.430 --> 01:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
responsible through entering those
 
01:01:33.470 --> 01:01:33.480 align:start position:0%
situations for taking the life of an
 
01:01:36.650 --> 01:01:36.660 align:start position:0%
innocent and I'm asking you to consider
 
01:01:38.450 --> 01:01:38.460 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill
 
01:01:40.130 --> 01:01:40.140 align:start position:0%
in order to
 
01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
stop putting police officers in
 
01:01:45.289 --> 01:01:45.299 align:start position:0%
lose-lose situations we are we have a
 
01:01:48.530 --> 01:01:48.540 align:start position:0%
system in which nobody should be the
 
01:01:51.589 --> 01:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
judge the jury and the Executioner and
 
01:01:54.109 --> 01:01:54.119 align:start position:0%
yet this is what happens a lot of the
 
01:01:55.990 --> 01:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
times in no knock warrant scenarios
 
01:01:58.789 --> 01:01:58.799 align:start position:0%
because we are creating that situation
 
01:02:00.890 --> 01:02:00.900 align:start position:0%
where everything is escalated nobody
 
01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
knows who is there
 
01:02:04.069 --> 01:02:04.079 align:start position:0%
and you gotta make split-second
 
01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
decisions and no human no matter how
 
01:02:09.289 --> 01:02:09.299 align:start position:0%
great and how trained and how you know
 
01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
well intended they are can judge every
 
01:02:13.670 --> 01:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
one of those situations correctly I
 
01:02:16.069 --> 01:02:16.079 align:start position:0%
would urge you to consider you know
 
01:02:18.650 --> 01:02:18.660 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill to stop putting our
 
01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
police officers in those situations and
 
01:02:23.089 --> 01:02:23.099 align:start position:0%
to also to protect their lives and the
 
01:02:24.770 --> 01:02:24.780 align:start position:0%
lives of the people theirs were to
 
01:02:28.490 --> 01:02:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:30.289 --> 01:02:30.299 align:start position:0%
president Rhodes
 
01:02:33.289 --> 01:02:33.299 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um it in direct to
 
01:02:36.410 --> 01:02:36.420 align:start position:0%
your comment have you asked the officer
 
01:02:40.010 --> 01:02:40.020 align:start position:0%
any of the police officers if if they
 
01:02:41.870 --> 01:02:41.880 align:start position:0%
don't want to be in this particular
 
01:02:44.569 --> 01:02:44.579 align:start position:0%
situation if that's just your opinion
 
01:02:46.849 --> 01:02:46.859 align:start position:0%
I have spoken with a few police officers
 
01:02:48.950 --> 01:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
and I'm gonna also
 
01:02:51.109 --> 01:02:51.119 align:start position:0%
refer to my experience as a finance
 
01:02:51.119 --> 01:02:53.809 align:start position:0%
refer to my experience as a finance
director

01:02:53.809 --> 01:02:53.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:56.870 --> 01:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes people want the ability to
 
01:02:58.730 --> 01:02:58.740 align:start position:0%
make decisions and it is our
 
01:03:00.589 --> 01:03:00.599 align:start position:0%
responsibility as people who make the
 
01:03:03.589 --> 01:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
rules to not give them tools that will
 
01:03:05.690 --> 01:03:05.700 align:start position:0%
lead to a bad outcome as a finance
 
01:03:07.670 --> 01:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
doctor I would never approve a system in
 
01:03:10.549 --> 01:03:10.559 align:start position:0%
which somebody would receive money would
 
01:03:12.410 --> 01:03:12.420 align:start position:0%
you know verify they were received and
 
01:03:14.270 --> 01:03:14.280 align:start position:0%
it would put them in the you know in a
 
01:03:16.010 --> 01:03:16.020 align:start position:0%
pocket and then allowed be allowed to
 
01:03:18.230 --> 01:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
spend them no matter how honest they are
 
01:03:19.910 --> 01:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
there should be checks and balances into
 
01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:22.559 align:start position:0%
place the fact that I did speak with
 
01:03:24.710 --> 01:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
some police officers the majority of
 
01:03:29.089 --> 01:03:29.099 align:start position:0%
them did want to retain this power but I
 
01:03:31.130 --> 01:03:31.140 align:start position:0%
believe that it is in the best interest
 
01:03:34.010 --> 01:03:34.020 align:start position:0%
of the public and the police officers
 
01:03:36.289 --> 01:03:36.299 align:start position:0%
for us to not put them into those
 
01:03:36.299 --> 01:03:37.549 align:start position:0%
for us to not put them into those
situations

01:03:37.549 --> 01:03:37.559 align:start position:0%
situations
 
01:03:40.609 --> 01:03:40.619 align:start position:0%
you know because again sometimes
 
01:03:42.890 --> 01:03:42.900 align:start position:0%
it's the people in charge who need to
 
01:03:45.049 --> 01:03:45.059 align:start position:0%
make the rules and not everybody is
 
01:03:46.549 --> 01:03:46.559 align:start position:0%
going to be happy with the rules but we
 
01:03:48.230 --> 01:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
have to balance the best interest of
 
01:03:53.829 --> 01:03:53.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:56.809 --> 01:03:56.819 align:start position:0%
representative Cameron
 
01:03:58.250 --> 01:03:58.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:04:00.829 --> 01:04:00.839 align:start position:0%
taking my question I I'd like to note
 
01:04:04.670 --> 01:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
that the bill affects search warrants
 
01:04:07.549 --> 01:04:07.559 align:start position:0%
only and not arrest warrants so the
 
01:04:09.410 --> 01:04:09.420 align:start position:0%
police would still have the authority
 
01:04:12.530 --> 01:04:12.540 align:start position:0%
and ability to do a no knock arrest
 
01:04:14.870 --> 01:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
warrant is that is that my understanding
 
01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:17.030 align:start position:0%
warrant is that is that my understanding
correct

01:04:17.030 --> 01:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:19.670 align:start position:0%
correct
I

01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:04:21.530 --> 01:04:21.540 align:start position:0%
believe you are understanding it
 
01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
correctly but frankly you know
 
01:04:27.950 --> 01:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
I think that any no knock warrant is
 
01:04:30.770 --> 01:04:30.780 align:start position:0%
trouble waiting to happen and
 
01:04:34.490 --> 01:04:34.500 align:start position:0%
you know I would be supporting
 
01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
taking that tool from the toolbox of
 
01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:42.730 align:start position:0%
taking that tool from the toolbox of
anybody

01:04:42.730 --> 01:04:42.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:45.530 --> 01:04:45.540 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony oh I'm
 
01:04:48.530 --> 01:04:48.540 align:start position:0%
sorry representative scitec uh thank you
 
01:04:51.890 --> 01:04:51.900 align:start position:0%
uh doesn't a judge issue this doesn't he
 
01:04:53.930 --> 01:04:53.940 align:start position:0%
know the circumstances under which this
 
01:04:56.450 --> 01:04:56.460 align:start position:0%
is being done are we going to substitute
 
01:04:58.490 --> 01:04:58.500 align:start position:0%
public policy for the Judgment of a
 
01:04:58.500 --> 01:04:59.990 align:start position:0%
public policy for the Judgment of a
judge

01:04:59.990 --> 01:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
judge
 
01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.190 align:start position:0%
judge
foreign

01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:05:03.829 --> 01:05:03.839 align:start position:0%
I very much respect everybody involved
 
01:05:05.510 --> 01:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
in those decisions and I believe that
 
01:05:07.730 --> 01:05:07.740 align:start position:0%
they all do everything in their power to
 
01:05:10.970 --> 01:05:10.980 align:start position:0%
get to the right situations but the fact
 
01:05:12.650 --> 01:05:12.660 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:05:14.870 --> 01:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
there is a large number of situations
 
01:05:17.390 --> 01:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
when in hindsight those warrants should
 
01:05:19.010 --> 01:05:19.020 align:start position:0%
have never been issued and yet they were
 
01:05:21.470 --> 01:05:21.480 align:start position:0%
issued by a judge mistakes happen people
 
01:05:23.809 --> 01:05:23.819 align:start position:0%
provide incorrect information and so on
 
01:05:26.750 --> 01:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
and I would also argue that even when a
 
01:05:29.750 --> 01:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
judge okays that because the law says
 
01:05:31.910 --> 01:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
that under the circumstances that is an
 
01:05:34.190 --> 01:05:34.200 align:start position:0%
option in their toolbox the horrific
 
01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
outcomes of those types of raids on
 
01:05:39.170 --> 01:05:39.180 align:start position:0%
everybody involved again police officers
 
01:05:41.270 --> 01:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
and citizens
 
01:05:43.609 --> 01:05:43.619 align:start position:0%
are a place where absolutely it is the
 
01:05:46.010 --> 01:05:46.020 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the legislature to say
 
01:05:47.990 --> 01:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
that you know we don't want to put
 
01:05:49.910 --> 01:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
anybody in that situation frankly I
 
01:05:51.710 --> 01:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to be the judge that
 
01:05:53.569 --> 01:05:53.579 align:start position:0%
issued the warrant in the two cases I
 
01:05:54.950 --> 01:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned especially the case of
 
01:05:57.829 --> 01:05:57.839 align:start position:0%
Catherine Johnston in Georgia if you
 
01:05:59.809 --> 01:05:59.819 align:start position:0%
review it I'm sure it's a well-known
 
01:05:59.819 --> 01:06:01.730 align:start position:0%
review it I'm sure it's a well-known
case

01:06:01.730 --> 01:06:01.740 align:start position:0%
case
 
01:06:03.650 --> 01:06:03.660 align:start position:0%
that warrant should not have been issued
 
01:06:06.650 --> 01:06:06.660 align:start position:0%
a judge issued it because they acted on
 
01:06:08.569 --> 01:06:08.579 align:start position:0%
the information they had doing the best
 
01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
you know to get it right but I'm sure
 
01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
they feel responsibility in some way for
 
01:06:16.970 --> 01:06:16.980 align:start position:0%
the outcome of that warrant and again I
 
01:06:18.349 --> 01:06:18.359 align:start position:0%
don't think we should put those public
 
01:06:21.470 --> 01:06:21.480 align:start position:0%
servants in those situations
 
01:06:23.390 --> 01:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:06:25.609 --> 01:06:25.619 align:start position:0%
have you considered
 
01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:27.660 align:start position:0%
um and I know that we've discussed
 
01:06:30.529 --> 01:06:30.539 align:start position:0%
you've mentioned the um several horrific
 
01:06:32.809 --> 01:06:32.819 align:start position:0%
cases and uh
 
01:06:34.370 --> 01:06:34.380 align:start position:0%
and personally I don't think anyone's
 
01:06:36.609 --> 01:06:36.619 align:start position:0%
any evidence is worth someone's life
 
01:06:39.170 --> 01:06:39.180 align:start position:0%
having said that there's hundreds of
 
01:06:41.029 --> 01:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
search warrants no knock issued across
 
01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
the country every year that are to do
 
01:06:45.170 --> 01:06:45.180 align:start position:0%
with officer safety that where the
 
01:06:47.210 --> 01:06:47.220 align:start position:0%
suspect that they're going to get if he
 
01:06:49.490 --> 01:06:49.500 align:start position:0%
does or she has advanced warning they're
 
01:06:51.349 --> 01:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
coming they're going to be prepared to
 
01:06:53.930 --> 01:06:53.940 align:start position:0%
to fire on the officers what is your
 
01:06:56.089 --> 01:06:56.099 align:start position:0%
position on a no knock warrant for the
 
01:06:59.349 --> 01:06:59.359 align:start position:0%
for the safety of the officer
 
01:07:02.089 --> 01:07:02.099 align:start position:0%
I believe that it is an idea that is
 
01:07:03.410 --> 01:07:03.420 align:start position:0%
well intended
 
01:07:05.690 --> 01:07:05.700 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of places where that has
 
01:07:07.430 --> 01:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
the opposite effect
 
01:07:10.130 --> 01:07:10.140 align:start position:0%
think about you know I I don't I don't
 
01:07:11.870 --> 01:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
have the case number but there was at
 
01:07:13.370 --> 01:07:13.380 align:start position:0%
least one case somewhere in the midwest
 
01:07:15.410 --> 01:07:15.420 align:start position:0%
where a homeowner ended up killing
 
01:07:17.390 --> 01:07:17.400 align:start position:0%
police officers in the commission of a
 
01:07:20.089 --> 01:07:20.099 align:start position:0%
raid and was acquitted because they did
 
01:07:21.589 --> 01:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
not know they were the police and they
 
01:07:23.569 --> 01:07:23.579 align:start position:0%
ended up you know
 
01:07:26.150 --> 01:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
getting you know not suffering
 
01:07:28.490 --> 01:07:28.500 align:start position:0%
consequences but those police officers
 
01:07:30.349 --> 01:07:30.359 align:start position:0%
lost their lives in a scenario in which
 
01:07:32.089 --> 01:07:32.099 align:start position:0%
knocking on the door and announcing
 
01:07:34.970 --> 01:07:34.980 align:start position:0%
themselves would have eliminated that
 
01:07:37.490 --> 01:07:37.500 align:start position:0%
conflict I think it's just terrible to
 
01:07:39.589 --> 01:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
create these situations where nobody
 
01:07:41.329 --> 01:07:41.339 align:start position:0%
knows who is what
 
01:07:44.630 --> 01:07:44.640 align:start position:0%
and terrible things happen and we have
 
01:07:47.329 --> 01:07:47.339 align:start position:0%
to balance those situations against the
 
01:07:52.849 --> 01:07:52.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:55.549 --> 01:07:55.559 align:start position:0%
I like to point out that while he is not
 
01:07:58.130 --> 01:07:58.140 align:start position:0%
formally a co-sponsor he does obviously
 
01:08:00.710 --> 01:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
support the concept in the bill but he
 
01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
did not have a chance to weigh in on the
 
01:08:05.930 --> 01:08:05.940 align:start position:0%
language so maybe those questions should
 
01:08:09.410 --> 01:08:09.420 align:start position:0%
come to me in the formal co-sponsors but
 
01:08:12.470 --> 01:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
I'll leave his opinion to him
 
01:08:14.630 --> 01:08:14.640 align:start position:0%
thank you and you're sitting there and
 
01:08:16.910 --> 01:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
free to jump in at any point on a
 
01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:17.930 align:start position:0%
free to jump in at any point on a
question

01:08:17.930 --> 01:08:17.940 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:08:19.550 --> 01:08:19.560 align:start position:0%
um I think that's all the questions I
 
01:08:21.169 --> 01:08:21.179 align:start position:0%
don't see any other hands so thank you
 
01:08:22.669 --> 01:08:22.679 align:start position:0%
for your testimony thank you so much
 
01:08:26.630 --> 01:08:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:28.130 --> 01:08:28.140 align:start position:0%
I think one of them's leaving and the
 
01:08:29.150 --> 01:08:29.160 align:start position:0%
other one's still going to stay is that
 
01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:30.950 align:start position:0%
other one's still going to stay is that
correct

01:08:30.950 --> 01:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
yes and I there are other co-sponsors
 
01:08:37.070 --> 01:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
here who have committee at the same time
 
01:08:39.950 --> 01:08:39.960 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to speak now I just am mindful
 
01:08:43.130 --> 01:08:43.140 align:start position:0%
when I have had committee days the same
 
01:08:44.749 --> 01:08:44.759 align:start position:0%
time you know you know what I'm saying
 
01:08:47.390 --> 01:08:47.400 align:start position:0%
who's next um that would like to as a
 
01:08:54.590 --> 01:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:57.050 --> 01:08:57.060 align:start position:0%
good morning uh representative Santo
 
01:09:00.410 --> 01:09:00.420 align:start position:0%
nastasso Fringe Jaffrey Dublin uh I'd
 
01:09:01.849 --> 01:09:01.859 align:start position:0%
like to address your question about the
 
01:09:03.289 --> 01:09:03.299 align:start position:0%
officer safety
 
01:09:06.169 --> 01:09:06.179 align:start position:0%
um a lot of times these no knock raids
 
01:09:06.179 --> 01:09:07.669 align:start position:0%
um a lot of times these no knock raids
uh

01:09:07.669 --> 01:09:07.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:09:10.610 --> 01:09:10.620 align:start position:0%
the individual in question they can
 
01:09:12.050 --> 01:09:12.060 align:start position:0%
arrest these guys
 
01:09:15.530 --> 01:09:15.540 align:start position:0%
in the city you know anytime uh they
 
01:09:17.269 --> 01:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
don't need to do these no knock raid
 
01:09:19.849 --> 01:09:19.859 align:start position:0%
things uh just like
 
01:09:22.070 --> 01:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
um a couple examples of David koresh
 
01:09:24.110 --> 01:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
they they could arrest that guy in the
 
01:09:25.490 --> 01:09:25.500 align:start position:0%
city at any time they didn't have to
 
01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:29.759 align:start position:0%
seize the property and uh locally we had
 
01:09:32.090 --> 01:09:32.100 align:start position:0%
uh Ian Freeman they didn't know knock
 
01:09:35.209 --> 01:09:35.219 align:start position:0%
right on uh I think in 2020
 
01:09:35.219 --> 01:09:35.749 align:start position:0%
right on uh I think in 2020
um

01:09:35.749 --> 01:09:35.759 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:38.090 --> 01:09:38.100 align:start position:0%
same thing they could have just they why
 
01:09:39.650 --> 01:09:39.660 align:start position:0%
do they need to do a no knock rate they
 
01:09:41.090 --> 01:09:41.100 align:start position:0%
could have just waited until he was in
 
01:09:42.890 --> 01:09:42.900 align:start position:0%
the city and just arrested him or they
 
01:09:44.809 --> 01:09:44.819 align:start position:0%
could have just you know anyway
 
01:09:48.709 --> 01:09:48.719 align:start position:0%
uh but the as a perspective of State
 
01:09:51.650 --> 01:09:51.660 align:start position:0%
policy we can't have no knock raids
 
01:09:55.430 --> 01:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
because we have uh you know it's legal
 
01:09:58.610 --> 01:09:58.620 align:start position:0%
and it's a very large culture of gun
 
01:10:01.189 --> 01:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
ownership in this state and when you
 
01:10:04.310 --> 01:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
have a no knock raid going on uh you
 
01:10:05.570 --> 01:10:05.580 align:start position:0%
know the police are doing what they're
 
01:10:07.850 --> 01:10:07.860 align:start position:0%
supposed to be doing and the individual
 
01:10:10.130 --> 01:10:10.140 align:start position:0%
getting his house rated by the police is
 
01:10:11.689 --> 01:10:11.699 align:start position:0%
going to do what he believes is correct
 
01:10:13.189 --> 01:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
to do to defend his family and his
 
01:10:17.390 --> 01:10:17.400 align:start position:0%
property and uh so we got two people
 
01:10:20.090 --> 01:10:20.100 align:start position:0%
acting appropriately uh and it can cause
 
01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
us violent conflict so just because of
 
01:10:25.610 --> 01:10:25.620 align:start position:0%
the way we have firearms in the state
 
01:10:28.370 --> 01:10:28.380 align:start position:0%
and and the way people believe that they
 
01:10:30.110 --> 01:10:30.120 align:start position:0%
have a right to use them uh we can't
 
01:10:32.990 --> 01:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
have this policy of no knock raids and
 
01:10:34.790 --> 01:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
uh that's basically the point I wanted
 
01:10:35.750 --> 01:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
to make
 
01:10:38.270 --> 01:10:38.280 align:start position:0%
thank you um just a question
 
01:10:40.910 --> 01:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
um the the koresh and Freeman cases
 
01:10:44.030 --> 01:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
those were Federal were they not
 
01:10:47.090 --> 01:10:47.100 align:start position:0%
uh well crash case a long time ago so I
 
01:10:50.570 --> 01:10:50.580 align:start position:0%
don't remember the FBI ATF yeah the um
 
01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
Ian Freeman it was a co-operation
 
01:10:55.970 --> 01:10:55.980 align:start position:0%
between uh state federal and local okay
 
01:10:58.669 --> 01:10:58.679 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:11:00.229 --> 01:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
and no further questions thank you for
 
01:11:05.930 --> 01:11:05.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:08.209 --> 01:11:08.219 align:start position:0%
is this the last co-sponsor I believe
 
01:11:10.370 --> 01:11:10.380 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:11:12.530 --> 01:11:12.540 align:start position:0%
hello my name is Glenn Bailey
 
01:11:16.250 --> 01:11:16.260 align:start position:0%
representing Stratford II uh
 
01:11:18.470 --> 01:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
I was looking at the fiscal note
 
01:11:20.810 --> 01:11:20.820 align:start position:0%
associated with this
 
01:11:22.370 --> 01:11:22.380 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire Municipal
 
01:11:24.590 --> 01:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
Association indicates no knock warrants
 
01:11:26.750 --> 01:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
rely on the tactic of speed to avoid
 
01:11:28.610 --> 01:11:28.620 align:start position:0%
destruction of evidence or harm to
 
01:11:30.470 --> 01:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
officers and others
 
01:11:34.510 --> 01:11:34.520 align:start position:0%
it's not working they're harming others
 
01:11:37.790 --> 01:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
and it's a little bit of tunnel vision
 
01:11:39.890 --> 01:11:39.900 align:start position:0%
I have here
 
01:11:42.709 --> 01:11:42.719 align:start position:0%
from the U.S Supreme Court the case of
 
01:11:45.470 --> 01:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
coffin versus the United States it is
 
01:11:47.570 --> 01:11:47.580 align:start position:0%
better to let the crime of a guilty
 
01:11:50.930 --> 01:11:50.940 align:start position:0%
person go unpunished than to condemn or
 
01:11:54.470 --> 01:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
I'll add to harm the innocent
 
01:11:57.590 --> 01:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
and it goes way way back to the Romans
 
01:12:00.050 --> 01:12:00.060 align:start position:0%
had this same principle it's in
 
01:12:02.990 --> 01:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
Blackstone you know
 
01:12:04.970 --> 01:12:04.980 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
01:12:07.669 --> 01:12:07.679 align:start position:0%
we're gonna bust in and they seem to do
 
01:12:09.590 --> 01:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
it on very little evidence
 
01:12:11.689 --> 01:12:11.699 align:start position:0%
that I mean I've looked and I've said
 
01:12:14.689 --> 01:12:14.699 align:start position:0%
it's very easy to find thousands of
 
01:12:16.430 --> 01:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
articles about this
 
01:12:18.410 --> 01:12:18.420 align:start position:0%
in which and there was one that was
 
01:12:20.570 --> 01:12:20.580 align:start position:0%
somewhat amusing where they
 
01:12:22.850 --> 01:12:22.860 align:start position:0%
arrested the mayor if they broke in the
 
01:12:25.669 --> 01:12:25.679 align:start position:0%
house of the mayor of their own City by
 
01:12:25.679 --> 01:12:27.830 align:start position:0%
house of the mayor of their own City by
mistake

01:12:27.830 --> 01:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
mistake
 
01:12:29.330 --> 01:12:29.340 align:start position:0%
um and there's of course that horrific
 
01:12:31.490 --> 01:12:31.500 align:start position:0%
one where they fired the flashbang into
 
01:12:34.010 --> 01:12:34.020 align:start position:0%
the crib of the little child who was
 
01:12:36.530 --> 01:12:36.540 align:start position:0%
horribly disfigured for Life having
 
01:12:38.270 --> 01:12:38.280 align:start position:0%
barely lived
 
01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:39.830 align:start position:0%
barely lived
and

01:12:39.830 --> 01:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:12:41.570 --> 01:12:41.580 align:start position:0%
so I would remind you that it's better
 
01:12:44.209 --> 01:12:44.219 align:start position:0%
to let the guilty go unpunished than to
 
01:12:46.970 --> 01:12:46.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:46.980 --> 01:12:48.950 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:12:48.950 --> 01:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:50.149 --> 01:12:50.159 align:start position:0%
I guess that's
 
01:12:50.159 --> 01:12:52.370 align:start position:0%
I guess that's
all

01:12:52.370 --> 01:12:52.380 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:12:55.010 --> 01:12:55.020 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your testimony
 
01:12:57.890 --> 01:12:57.900 align:start position:0%
oh representative Newell
 
01:13:00.050 --> 01:13:00.060 align:start position:0%
um I know and I'm sure many of us have
 
01:13:02.149 --> 01:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
heard examples of you know how this has
 
01:13:04.010 --> 01:13:04.020 align:start position:0%
happened anecdotally I'm wondering if
 
01:13:05.810 --> 01:13:05.820 align:start position:0%
there's any is there any place where
 
01:13:08.510 --> 01:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
there's actually statistics aggregated
 
01:13:12.110 --> 01:13:12.120 align:start position:0%
about you know um not that I know but I
 
01:13:14.590 --> 01:13:14.600 align:start position:0%
I just spent half an hour and literally
 
01:13:19.370 --> 01:13:19.380 align:start position:0%
thousands of faulty no-knock raids thank
 
01:13:21.290 --> 01:13:21.300 align:start position:0%
you and people have been killed I mean I
 
01:13:22.910 --> 01:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
won't say thousands have been killed but
 
01:13:25.070 --> 01:13:25.080 align:start position:0%
it hunt dozens hundreds you know I don't
 
01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:26.030 align:start position:0%
it hunt dozens hundreds you know I don't
know

01:13:26.030 --> 01:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:13:28.729 --> 01:13:28.739 align:start position:0%
and so those are the innocent being
 
01:13:31.370 --> 01:13:31.380 align:start position:0%
punished by sloppy
 
01:13:34.310 --> 01:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
it's it's often based on confidential
 
01:13:36.229 --> 01:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
informance and they get the addresses
 
01:13:39.229 --> 01:13:39.239 align:start position:0%
wrong or well the person's there once a
 
01:13:41.030 --> 01:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
month and they bust in and all the whole
 
01:13:43.250 --> 01:13:43.260 align:start position:0%
family at gunpoint it's just
 
01:13:43.260 --> 01:13:47.570 align:start position:0%
family at gunpoint it's just
unconscionable

01:13:47.570 --> 01:13:47.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:51.770 --> 01:13:51.780 align:start position:0%
representative scitec no no no I'm just
 
01:13:54.050 --> 01:13:54.060 align:start position:0%
representative scitec it does go back to
 
01:13:56.750 --> 01:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:58.970 --> 01:13:58.980 align:start position:0%
try not to elicit a question when he
 
01:14:01.970 --> 01:14:01.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:04.070 --> 01:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
that thank you for your testimony this
 
01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:07.430 align:start position:0%
that thank you for your testimony this
morning

01:14:07.430 --> 01:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:10.729 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:14:10.729 --> 01:14:10.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:11.810 --> 01:14:11.820 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
01:14:14.209 --> 01:14:14.219 align:start position:0%
I'm representative Chris Schultz
 
01:14:17.149 --> 01:14:17.159 align:start position:0%
um from Concord including where we sit
 
01:14:19.070 --> 01:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
is part of my district
 
01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
um I think they all cited good reasons I
 
01:14:24.709 --> 01:14:24.719 align:start position:0%
think we all arrived at the same point
 
01:14:28.070 --> 01:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
for a number of instances like this
 
01:14:31.250 --> 01:14:31.260 align:start position:0%
um I was inspired by
 
01:14:33.770 --> 01:14:33.780 align:start position:0%
um the unfortunate death of Brianna
 
01:14:33.780 --> 01:14:34.550 align:start position:0%
um the unfortunate death of Brianna
Taylor

01:14:34.550 --> 01:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
Taylor
 
01:14:38.090 --> 01:14:38.100 align:start position:0%
I'm from Louisville originally and one
 
01:14:40.550 --> 01:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
of my high school classmates was an EMT
 
01:14:44.209 --> 01:14:44.219 align:start position:0%
with her so I shared her grief
 
01:14:47.209 --> 01:14:47.219 align:start position:0%
from here
 
01:14:49.310 --> 01:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
and that was an unfortunate innocent
 
01:14:52.070 --> 01:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
person public servant who served the
 
01:14:54.010 --> 01:14:54.020 align:start position:0%
community well who
 
01:14:56.750 --> 01:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately did pass away because of a
 
01:14:59.270 --> 01:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
clerical error
 
01:14:59.280 --> 01:14:59.990 align:start position:0%
clerical error
um

01:14:59.990 --> 01:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:02.270 --> 01:15:02.280 align:start position:0%
but as they stated there are so many
 
01:15:04.790 --> 01:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
instances I could name a few others that
 
01:15:07.550 --> 01:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
I knew of before that but the language
 
01:15:10.850 --> 01:15:10.860 align:start position:0%
of this is essentially the same or
 
01:15:13.250 --> 01:15:13.260 align:start position:0%
similar language put into New Hampshire
 
01:15:17.209 --> 01:15:17.219 align:start position:0%
words that mirrored what the city of
 
01:15:19.550 --> 01:15:19.560 align:start position:0%
Louisville did so if you have a a
 
01:15:21.410 --> 01:15:21.420 align:start position:0%
problem with the language and you want
 
01:15:22.850 --> 01:15:22.860 align:start position:0%
to include
 
01:15:26.330 --> 01:15:26.340 align:start position:0%
more instances to ban I would be open to
 
01:15:29.270 --> 01:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
that but that's where the language of
 
01:15:32.870 --> 01:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
this comes from and then was put into
 
01:15:35.750 --> 01:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
words to fit New Hampshire law with the
 
01:15:38.570 --> 01:15:38.580 align:start position:0%
OLS folks who wrote the Bill
 
01:15:41.750 --> 01:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
um it's also interesting a complication
 
01:15:43.850 --> 01:15:43.860 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe complications the wrong word
 
01:15:46.610 --> 01:15:46.620 align:start position:0%
but while I did not watch the
 
01:15:47.870 --> 01:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
president's State of the Union
 
01:15:50.870 --> 01:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
apparently he is issuing an executive
 
01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:51.770 align:start position:0%
apparently he is issuing an executive
order

01:15:51.770 --> 01:15:51.780 align:start position:0%
order
 
01:15:54.970 --> 01:15:54.980 align:start position:0%
uh with a no knock warrant ban
 
01:15:57.649 --> 01:15:57.659 align:start position:0%
obviously all these forces are coming
 
01:16:00.290 --> 01:16:00.300 align:start position:0%
together liberty-minded Republicans
 
01:16:02.510 --> 01:16:02.520 align:start position:0%
Progressive Democrats the president
 
01:16:05.209 --> 01:16:05.219 align:start position:0%
black lives matter and I think we're at
 
01:16:08.450 --> 01:16:08.460 align:start position:0%
a Tipping Point on this issue and I I
 
01:16:11.630 --> 01:16:11.640 align:start position:0%
have spoken to law enforcement to get to
 
01:16:14.810 --> 01:16:14.820 align:start position:0%
an earlier question and I know they want
 
01:16:17.330 --> 01:16:17.340 align:start position:0%
all the tools in the toolbox they can
 
01:16:20.090 --> 01:16:20.100 align:start position:0%
have to keep us safe and I respect that
 
01:16:23.090 --> 01:16:23.100 align:start position:0%
but it is our job to put the bumpers
 
01:16:23.100 --> 01:16:24.169 align:start position:0%
but it is our job to put the bumpers
around

01:16:24.169 --> 01:16:24.179 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:16:28.550 --> 01:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
what that is when we see a need for
 
01:16:32.030 --> 01:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
um doing that we should do that and I
 
01:16:34.729 --> 01:16:34.739 align:start position:0%
you know I would not be shocked if they
 
01:16:37.370 --> 01:16:37.380 align:start position:0%
say if any of them choose to speak today
 
01:16:39.649 --> 01:16:39.659 align:start position:0%
or you may hear from your own law
 
01:16:42.050 --> 01:16:42.060 align:start position:0%
enforcement that it's not a problem here
 
01:16:44.990 --> 01:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
well I'm a big fan of should we wait
 
01:16:47.450 --> 01:16:47.460 align:start position:0%
until it's a problem here when there
 
01:16:49.250 --> 01:16:49.260 align:start position:0%
have been enough instances of this
 
01:16:51.709 --> 01:16:51.719 align:start position:0%
across the country
 
01:16:53.870 --> 01:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
um I know of a horrible incident on a
 
01:16:56.450 --> 01:16:56.460 align:start position:0%
separate topic where we waited until
 
01:16:59.149 --> 01:16:59.159 align:start position:0%
something awful happened before we fixed
 
01:17:02.209 --> 01:17:02.219 align:start position:0%
an issue in Concord and so I don't want
 
01:17:05.209 --> 01:17:05.219 align:start position:0%
to wait for this to be a problem
 
01:17:05.219 --> 01:17:05.870 align:start position:0%
to wait for this to be a problem
um

01:17:05.870 --> 01:17:05.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:08.570 --> 01:17:08.580 align:start position:0%
so for that
 
01:17:10.250 --> 01:17:10.260 align:start position:0%
um oh and the other big point I wanted
 
01:17:12.770 --> 01:17:12.780 align:start position:0%
to make is we are a state that
 
01:17:14.930 --> 01:17:14.940 align:start position:0%
encourages gun ownership
 
01:17:17.990 --> 01:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
I know you heard about that quite a bit
 
01:17:20.149 --> 01:17:20.159 align:start position:0%
yesterday I admire your tenacity and
 
01:17:22.970 --> 01:17:22.980 align:start position:0%
resilience on the topic and while we may
 
01:17:25.490 --> 01:17:25.500 align:start position:0%
disagree on some of the issues
 
01:17:28.189 --> 01:17:28.199 align:start position:0%
surrounding that I'm mindful that that
 
01:17:30.350 --> 01:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
actually puts police officers at risk
 
01:17:33.590 --> 01:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
potentially that if someone for whatever
 
01:17:37.970 --> 01:17:37.980 align:start position:0%
reason is um law enforcement
 
01:17:41.930 --> 01:17:41.940 align:start position:0%
does the no knock warrant thing in their
 
01:17:44.390 --> 01:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
home and someone has a gun for safety
 
01:17:46.669 --> 01:17:46.679 align:start position:0%
purposes that puts them at risk I don't
 
01:17:49.850 --> 01:17:49.860 align:start position:0%
by the point that this would be better
 
01:17:52.250 --> 01:17:52.260 align:start position:0%
in that instance to do it unannounced I
 
01:17:54.050 --> 01:17:54.060 align:start position:0%
actually believe that's the opposite I
 
01:17:56.450 --> 01:17:56.460 align:start position:0%
think that's common sense but again I
 
01:17:58.669 --> 01:17:58.679 align:start position:0%
respect the fact that folks want all the
 
01:18:01.189 --> 01:18:01.199 align:start position:0%
tools in the toolbox but this is a
 
01:18:03.550 --> 01:18:03.560 align:start position:0%
Tipping Point on this issue to address
 
01:18:06.830 --> 01:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
and that so many disparate forces in New
 
01:18:09.290 --> 01:18:09.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire have come together
 
01:18:11.030 --> 01:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
um and just in general with the Tipping
 
01:18:12.770 --> 01:18:12.780 align:start position:0%
Point issue like I pointed out I feel
 
01:18:14.090 --> 01:18:14.100 align:start position:0%
like it's time
 
01:18:17.209 --> 01:18:17.219 align:start position:0%
to prevent this from becoming a problem
 
01:18:17.219 --> 01:18:18.350 align:start position:0%
to prevent this from becoming a problem
here

01:18:18.350 --> 01:18:18.360 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:18:21.110 --> 01:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to answer all the
 
01:18:24.470 --> 01:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
questions you may have had unanswered
 
01:18:27.110 --> 01:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
as best as I best of my ability
 
01:18:29.209 --> 01:18:29.219 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
01:18:31.610 --> 01:18:31.620 align:start position:0%
um So based on what you're saying you
 
01:18:33.229 --> 01:18:33.239 align:start position:0%
wouldn't mind if we just retain this
 
01:18:34.910 --> 01:18:34.920 align:start position:0%
because the president has it covered or
 
01:18:37.310 --> 01:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
I actually did think about suggesting
 
01:18:39.229 --> 01:18:39.239 align:start position:0%
that I mean my issue with that is I
 
01:18:40.550 --> 01:18:40.560 align:start position:0%
don't know which would take precedence
 
01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:42.890 align:start position:0%
don't know which would take precedence
quicker

01:18:42.890 --> 01:18:42.900 align:start position:0%
quicker
 
01:18:42.900 --> 01:18:43.550 align:start position:0%
quicker
um

01:18:43.550 --> 01:18:43.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:46.189 --> 01:18:46.199 align:start position:0%
honestly I have mixed feelings about
 
01:18:48.770 --> 01:18:48.780 align:start position:0%
that I mean I think an executive order
 
01:18:50.810 --> 01:18:50.820 align:start position:0%
comes and goes depending on the
 
01:18:52.910 --> 01:18:52.920 align:start position:0%
president I think we would need to
 
01:18:54.169 --> 01:18:54.179 align:start position:0%
address it in New Hampshire law
 
01:18:56.870 --> 01:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
regardless I don't know if an executive
 
01:18:59.930 --> 01:18:59.940 align:start position:0%
order would take precedent or go into
 
01:19:04.430 --> 01:19:04.440 align:start position:0%
effect sooner than the bill which is
 
01:19:06.770 --> 01:19:06.780 align:start position:0%
UH 60 days after its passage that's
 
01:19:06.780 --> 01:19:08.149 align:start position:0%
UH 60 days after its passage that's
actually

01:19:08.149 --> 01:19:08.159 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:19:11.090 --> 01:19:11.100 align:start position:0%
a pretty Swift uh enactment but we're
 
01:19:13.310 --> 01:19:13.320 align:start position:0%
not exactly the swiftest necessarily
 
01:19:15.110 --> 01:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
with our legislative and executive
 
01:19:17.209 --> 01:19:17.219 align:start position:0%
process but I'm open
 
01:19:19.910 --> 01:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
so yeah I would be open to that
 
01:19:21.649 --> 01:19:21.659 align:start position:0%
representative Rhodes you had a question
 
01:19:25.010 --> 01:19:25.020 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair I'm thank you for
 
01:19:29.149 --> 01:19:29.159 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm just curious on
 
01:19:30.950 --> 01:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
where it says before ending the premises
 
01:19:33.530 --> 01:19:33.540 align:start position:0%
give appropriate notice what what would
 
01:19:35.750 --> 01:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
be considered what what how long is the
 
01:19:37.610 --> 01:19:37.620 align:start position:0%
officer supposed to what is the
 
01:19:39.649 --> 01:19:39.659 align:start position:0%
appropriate notice I feel like this is
 
01:19:42.669 --> 01:19:42.679 align:start position:0%
common sense you know knocking
 
01:19:46.130 --> 01:19:46.140 align:start position:0%
saying police or FBI or whatever I
 
01:19:48.050 --> 01:19:48.060 align:start position:0%
realize we don't address the FBI I
 
01:19:50.270 --> 01:19:50.280 align:start position:0%
apologize for
 
01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
01:19:54.169 --> 01:19:54.179 align:start position:0%
what would be traditional would be a
 
01:19:54.179 --> 01:19:55.189 align:start position:0%
what would be traditional would be a
knock

01:19:55.189 --> 01:19:55.199 align:start position:0%
knock
 
01:19:57.709 --> 01:19:57.719 align:start position:0%
you know this really is that designation
 
01:19:59.330 --> 01:19:59.340 align:start position:0%
of announcing
 
01:20:01.970 --> 01:20:01.980 align:start position:0%
that you're here I mean I will admit I'm
 
01:20:04.250 --> 01:20:04.260 align:start position:0%
probably seeing this happen more on TV
 
01:20:08.030 --> 01:20:08.040 align:start position:0%
than in person but I would think that
 
01:20:10.490 --> 01:20:10.500 align:start position:0%
this would be a common sense
 
01:20:14.570 --> 01:20:14.580 align:start position:0%
you know a common sense
 
01:20:16.790 --> 01:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
moment of safety
 
01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:23.510 --> 01:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
representative Newman
 
01:20:25.850 --> 01:20:25.860 align:start position:0%
yeah I would just uh there was a
 
01:20:27.290 --> 01:20:27.300 align:start position:0%
question about what kind of warrants
 
01:20:29.630 --> 01:20:29.640 align:start position:0%
does this apply to when um the first
 
01:20:32.030 --> 01:20:32.040 align:start position:0%
sentence uh seems to be pretty
 
01:20:34.370 --> 01:20:34.380 align:start position:0%
definitive that you it just says it'll
 
01:20:34.380 --> 01:20:35.570 align:start position:0%
definitive that you it just says it'll
execute

01:20:35.570 --> 01:20:35.580 align:start position:0%
execute
 
01:20:38.990 --> 01:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
uh a no knock search warrant so it it
 
01:20:41.270 --> 01:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't differentiate between arrest
 
01:20:43.310 --> 01:20:43.320 align:start position:0%
warrant and search warrant was that in
 
01:20:45.709 --> 01:20:45.719 align:start position:0%
the intent of the language yes and I
 
01:20:48.110 --> 01:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
would be open to including any type of
 
01:20:50.510 --> 01:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
Warrant potentially that that you would
 
01:20:53.149 --> 01:20:53.159 align:start position:0%
feel isn't necessary but that was the
 
01:20:53.159 --> 01:20:54.950 align:start position:0%
feel isn't necessary but that was the
instance

01:20:54.950 --> 01:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
instance
 
01:20:56.750 --> 01:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
um with the Louisville ordinance because
 
01:21:00.410 --> 01:21:00.420 align:start position:0%
that's what the warrant was
 
01:21:00.420 --> 01:21:01.370 align:start position:0%
that's what the warrant was
um

01:21:01.370 --> 01:21:01.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:03.770 --> 01:21:03.780 align:start position:0%
in Louisville I will admit so I'm open
 
01:21:03.780 --> 01:21:04.850 align:start position:0%
in Louisville I will admit so I'm open
to

01:21:04.850 --> 01:21:04.860 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:21:09.790 --> 01:21:09.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:12.770 --> 01:21:12.780 align:start position:0%
representative Muse
 
01:21:14.750 --> 01:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to point out in the
 
01:21:16.729 --> 01:21:16.739 align:start position:0%
statute that you reference
 
01:21:18.970 --> 01:21:18.980 align:start position:0%
um I don't see anything that actually
 
01:21:22.130 --> 01:21:22.140 align:start position:0%
authorizes a no-nock warrant
 
01:21:24.350 --> 01:21:24.360 align:start position:0%
so I'm kind of wondering
 
01:21:26.990 --> 01:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
uh how that may have evolved probably
 
01:21:28.970 --> 01:21:28.980 align:start position:0%
not a question for you but a question
 
01:21:30.590 --> 01:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
for maybe some of the folks who follow
 
01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:31.729 align:start position:0%
for maybe some of the folks who follow
you

01:21:31.729 --> 01:21:31.739 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:21:34.189 --> 01:21:34.199 align:start position:0%
interesting point
 
01:21:34.199 --> 01:21:36.169 align:start position:0%
interesting point
um

01:21:36.169 --> 01:21:36.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:38.930 --> 01:21:38.940 align:start position:0%
I do know what happens here
 
01:21:41.689 --> 01:21:41.699 align:start position:0%
I've found no statistics of how often it
 
01:21:44.990 --> 01:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
happens here with um state and local law
 
01:21:46.850 --> 01:21:46.860 align:start position:0%
enforcement but it definitely happens
 
01:21:46.860 --> 01:21:47.870 align:start position:0%
enforcement but it definitely happens
here

01:21:47.870 --> 01:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:49.850 align:start position:0%
here
so

01:21:49.850 --> 01:21:49.860 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:21:52.970 --> 01:21:52.980 align:start position:0%
regardless of if it's in current law a
 
01:21:58.130 --> 01:21:58.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:00.410 --> 01:22:00.420 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
01:22:04.850 --> 01:22:04.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:11.290 --> 01:22:11.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:14.570 --> 01:22:14.580 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman members of committee
 
01:22:16.729 --> 01:22:16.739 align:start position:0%
so I just want to talk about something
 
01:22:18.950 --> 01:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
that wasn't mentioned was the improper
 
01:22:21.649 --> 01:22:21.659 align:start position:0%
use of SWAT teams by people that are
 
01:22:23.990 --> 01:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
looking to pull pranks on people so I'm
 
01:22:25.310 --> 01:22:25.320 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm Jason Gerhard Northfield
 
01:22:26.990 --> 01:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
Franklin representative
 
01:22:29.169 --> 01:22:29.179 align:start position:0%
so swatting is when you call the police
 
01:22:31.850 --> 01:22:31.860 align:start position:0%
on this actually happens numerous times
 
01:22:33.470 --> 01:22:33.480 align:start position:0%
with video game people because they're
 
01:22:35.930 --> 01:22:35.940 align:start position:0%
playing live on the feed so it's funny
 
01:22:37.370 --> 01:22:37.380 align:start position:0%
to have the SWAT team running on your
 
01:22:38.810 --> 01:22:38.820 align:start position:0%
friend while he's playing a game but
 
01:22:40.610 --> 01:22:40.620 align:start position:0%
there's been deaths that have occurred
 
01:22:42.290 --> 01:22:42.300 align:start position:0%
and so that kind of goes back to the
 
01:22:45.410 --> 01:22:45.420 align:start position:0%
previous questions where we talked about
 
01:22:45.420 --> 01:22:46.250 align:start position:0%
previous questions where we talked about
foreign

01:22:46.250 --> 01:22:46.260 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:22:48.770 --> 01:22:48.780 align:start position:0%
why would we restrain these tools or
 
01:22:50.870 --> 01:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
keep these tools away from people's
 
01:22:53.149 --> 01:22:53.159 align:start position:0%
disposal and I think that the reason is
 
01:22:54.590 --> 01:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
that if you have a tool you're going to
 
01:22:55.550 --> 01:22:55.560 align:start position:0%
use it
 
01:22:58.250 --> 01:22:58.260 align:start position:0%
so just because these they exist so they
 
01:22:59.810 --> 01:22:59.820 align:start position:0%
have there has to be a justification of
 
01:23:02.270 --> 01:23:02.280 align:start position:0%
why you have what you have so then I was
 
01:23:05.090 --> 01:23:05.100 align:start position:0%
doing a little bit of quick research and
 
01:23:06.590 --> 01:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
I came across
 
01:23:08.750 --> 01:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
from Worcester Massachusetts the Worster
 
01:23:10.070 --> 01:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
magazine just has an article about the
 
01:23:11.090 --> 01:23:11.100 align:start position:0%
history which I thought was kind of
 
01:23:12.890 --> 01:23:12.900 align:start position:0%
interesting is very quick the SWOT
 
01:23:14.870 --> 01:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
concept dates back to the 1960s when
 
01:23:16.430 --> 01:23:16.440 align:start position:0%
urban riots and a mass shooting at the
 
01:23:17.870 --> 01:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
University of Texas demonstrated that
 
01:23:19.490 --> 01:23:19.500 align:start position:0%
law enforcement needed to prepare to
 
01:23:20.570 --> 01:23:20.580 align:start position:0%
respond to emergency situations
 
01:23:22.550 --> 01:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
involving hostages terrorists or crazed
 
01:23:24.530 --> 01:23:24.540 align:start position:0%
gunmen the following decades saw the
 
01:23:25.910 --> 01:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
development of the first tactical teams
 
01:23:27.890 --> 01:23:27.900 align:start position:0%
in New England by the 1980s the War on
 
01:23:29.209 --> 01:23:29.219 align:start position:0%
Drugs led the federal government to
 
01:23:30.830 --> 01:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
start channeling more resources to local
 
01:23:32.330 --> 01:23:32.340 align:start position:0%
and state law enforcement agencies
 
01:23:34.370 --> 01:23:34.380 align:start position:0%
leading to a major expansion of SWAT
 
01:23:36.050 --> 01:23:36.060 align:start position:0%
rates and a drift away from the original
 
01:23:38.750 --> 01:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
purpose of SWAT for example
 
01:23:40.550 --> 01:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
the Massachusetts State Police Special
 
01:23:43.070 --> 01:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
tactics and operations team was rarely
 
01:23:45.169 --> 01:23:45.179 align:start position:0%
activated during the 1970s and then only
 
01:23:48.830 --> 01:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
for extreme incidents incidences
 
01:23:50.990 --> 01:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
like airplane hijackings
 
01:23:53.090 --> 01:23:53.100 align:start position:0%
so the number of operations has since
 
01:23:55.490 --> 01:23:55.500 align:start position:0%
increased from around 17 per year in the
 
01:23:58.430 --> 01:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
mid-1970s to 180 to 200 times per year
 
01:23:58.440 --> 01:23:59.930 align:start position:0%
mid-1970s to 180 to 200 times per year
today

01:23:59.930 --> 01:23:59.940 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:24:02.030 --> 01:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
so I think New Hampshire and the rest of
 
01:24:04.490 --> 01:24:04.500 align:start position:0%
well New England obviously got swept up
 
01:24:05.750 --> 01:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
in the drug war and this is just another
 
01:24:07.430 --> 01:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
byproduct of it
 
01:24:09.410 --> 01:24:09.420 align:start position:0%
and I think it's it's a dangerous
 
01:24:11.330 --> 01:24:11.340 align:start position:0%
dangerous Trend and it just it
 
01:24:13.130 --> 01:24:13.140 align:start position:0%
discourages trust between
 
01:24:15.169 --> 01:24:15.179 align:start position:0%
regular people and the police
 
01:24:19.010 --> 01:24:19.020 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily I'm I think is
 
01:24:21.410 --> 01:24:21.420 align:start position:0%
just personal experience and and seeing
 
01:24:23.090 --> 01:24:23.100 align:start position:0%
that it's very rare that you need to go
 
01:24:24.350 --> 01:24:24.360 align:start position:0%
bust down somebody's door when people
 
01:24:26.689 --> 01:24:26.699 align:start position:0%
are so intermingled with Society
 
01:24:28.490 --> 01:24:28.500 align:start position:0%
there's a way in place and a time to do
 
01:24:29.990 --> 01:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
it and I trust that our law enforcement
 
01:24:31.910 --> 01:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
has the capability to do it especially
 
01:24:32.870 --> 01:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
with all the surveillance equipment
 
01:24:34.370 --> 01:24:34.380 align:start position:0%
nowadays you can pretty much know when
 
01:24:35.090 --> 01:24:35.100 align:start position:0%
somebody's going to the bathroom
 
01:24:37.189 --> 01:24:37.199 align:start position:0%
literally so
 
01:24:41.870 --> 01:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:43.910 --> 01:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
represent Newell
 
01:24:45.350 --> 01:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:24:47.510 --> 01:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question so
 
01:24:48.770 --> 01:24:48.780 align:start position:0%
um that's interesting I was thinking
 
01:24:50.750 --> 01:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
about that as well but I'm not sure is
 
01:24:54.110 --> 01:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
is swatting or is are these things
 
01:24:56.030 --> 01:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
synonymous right is it no knock warrant
 
01:24:58.910 --> 01:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
the same thing as what happens when
 
01:25:00.410 --> 01:25:00.420 align:start position:0%
someone swats another person sure the
 
01:25:02.930 --> 01:25:02.940 align:start position:0%
warrant process does add a layer of
 
01:25:05.270 --> 01:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
safeness to it admittedly but at the
 
01:25:07.490 --> 01:25:07.500 align:start position:0%
same time I just wonder if we've not
 
01:25:10.490 --> 01:25:10.500 align:start position:0%
made this now a cultural thing I mean
 
01:25:13.550 --> 01:25:13.560 align:start position:0%
we're kids doing this in the 1970s
 
01:25:15.229 --> 01:25:15.239 align:start position:0%
yeah I wonder too I mean especially
 
01:25:17.930 --> 01:25:17.940 align:start position:0%
swatting the the idea of just having
 
01:25:19.729 --> 01:25:19.739 align:start position:0%
very flimsy evidence somebody called up
 
01:25:21.709 --> 01:25:21.719 align:start position:0%
and said used so that the standards for
 
01:25:23.689 --> 01:25:23.699 align:start position:0%
using said tool decrease so we can get
 
01:25:25.490 --> 01:25:25.500 align:start position:0%
usage out of it and say hey there's the
 
01:25:27.590 --> 01:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
reason we have this armored personnel
 
01:25:29.270 --> 01:25:29.280 align:start position:0%
carrier sitting next to the fire truck I
 
01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:29.930 align:start position:0%
carrier sitting next to the fire truck I
mean

01:25:29.930 --> 01:25:29.940 align:start position:0%
mean
 
01:25:33.169 --> 01:25:33.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:41.770 --> 01:25:41.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:46.250 --> 01:25:46.260 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes Joseph lacaze and
 
01:25:46.260 --> 01:25:49.130 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes Joseph lacaze and
um

01:25:49.130 --> 01:25:49.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:54.669 --> 01:25:54.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:57.410 --> 01:25:57.420 align:start position:0%
thank you it's okay it's okay it's a
 
01:25:59.810 --> 01:25:59.820 align:start position:0%
good French name I can run run for
 
01:26:01.370 --> 01:26:01.380 align:start position:0%
office in the North Country
 
01:26:01.380 --> 01:26:02.410 align:start position:0%
office in the North Country
um

01:26:02.410 --> 01:26:02.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:04.550 --> 01:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
legal director at the ACLU of New
 
01:26:06.590 --> 01:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you so much for the
 
01:26:09.050 --> 01:26:09.060 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify today I'm
 
01:26:11.090 --> 01:26:11.100 align:start position:0%
actually here uh in lieu of Joseph
 
01:26:15.229 --> 01:26:15.239 align:start position:0%
laskaz who is does our smart Justice
 
01:26:16.610 --> 01:26:16.620 align:start position:0%
work who's unfortunately unable to
 
01:26:17.750 --> 01:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
attend today
 
01:26:19.729 --> 01:26:19.739 align:start position:0%
um so I'll be speaking briefly on his
 
01:26:22.010 --> 01:26:22.020 align:start position:0%
behalf and on behalf of the organization
 
01:26:25.550 --> 01:26:25.560 align:start position:0%
this is a bill that we support
 
01:26:28.490 --> 01:26:28.500 align:start position:0%
um because I think we continue to have
 
01:26:30.350 --> 01:26:30.360 align:start position:0%
like so many community members and like
 
01:26:32.090 --> 01:26:32.100 align:start position:0%
so many people you've heard today
 
01:26:34.790 --> 01:26:34.800 align:start position:0%
have serious concerns with no knock
 
01:26:36.590 --> 01:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
warrants because they can have severe
 
01:26:39.830 --> 01:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
and deadly consequences for everyone
 
01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:41.629 align:start position:0%
and deadly consequences for everyone
involved

01:26:41.629 --> 01:26:41.639 align:start position:0%
involved
 
01:26:43.310 --> 01:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
so under a Noah Warren as you know
 
01:26:45.350 --> 01:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
police can barrage into a person's home
 
01:26:46.850 --> 01:26:46.860 align:start position:0%
they can do in the dead of night without
 
01:26:48.830 --> 01:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
any notice without clearly identifying
 
01:26:51.770 --> 01:26:51.780 align:start position:0%
themselves even as law enforcement and
 
01:26:54.290 --> 01:26:54.300 align:start position:0%
as law enforcement has become more
 
01:26:56.209 --> 01:26:56.219 align:start position:0%
militarized police departments have used
 
01:26:58.310 --> 01:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
battering rams to force entry into homes
 
01:27:00.890 --> 01:27:00.900 align:start position:0%
they've used flashbang grenades
 
01:27:03.169 --> 01:27:03.179 align:start position:0%
Etc and I can tell you this does happen
 
01:27:05.689 --> 01:27:05.699 align:start position:0%
you know in New Hampshire and in fact I
 
01:27:07.010 --> 01:27:07.020 align:start position:0%
had a case
 
01:27:11.270 --> 01:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
in 2015 in which the case was actually
 
01:27:13.669 --> 01:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
about videotaping law enforcement but
 
01:27:15.350 --> 01:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
prior to that action in which law
 
01:27:17.870 --> 01:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement was videotaped there was the
 
01:27:19.910 --> 01:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
use of a now walk warrant on his
 
01:27:23.330 --> 01:27:23.340 align:start position:0%
property and it terrified people
 
01:27:25.850 --> 01:27:25.860 align:start position:0%
um including the two women that were on
 
01:27:28.790 --> 01:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
the property there incendiary devices
 
01:27:30.530 --> 01:27:30.540 align:start position:0%
were thrown into the windows the doors
 
01:27:32.950 --> 01:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
were kicked down officers came in with
 
01:27:36.229 --> 01:27:36.239 align:start position:0%
semi-automatic weapons there was no
 
01:27:38.629 --> 01:27:38.639 align:start position:0%
issue and there didn't need to be a no
 
01:27:40.430 --> 01:27:40.440 align:start position:0%
knock rate but the place was trashed
 
01:27:42.649 --> 01:27:42.659 align:start position:0%
again people were terrorized
 
01:27:44.090 --> 01:27:44.100 align:start position:0%
law enforcement could have done their
 
01:27:47.149 --> 01:27:47.159 align:start position:0%
job without that um having occurred and
 
01:27:48.410 --> 01:27:48.420 align:start position:0%
certainly without the damage that was
 
01:27:50.570 --> 01:27:50.580 align:start position:0%
done to the individual's property but
 
01:27:52.070 --> 01:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
we've seen this of course nationally
 
01:27:54.350 --> 01:27:54.360 align:start position:0%
with much more devastating and severe
 
01:27:57.050 --> 01:27:57.060 align:start position:0%
consequences the Brianna Taylor case was
 
01:27:59.149 --> 01:27:59.159 align:start position:0%
mentioned and and there she was killed
 
01:28:00.770 --> 01:28:00.780 align:start position:0%
by police in a no walk raid in her
 
01:28:02.450 --> 01:28:02.460 align:start position:0%
residence it was part of a it seemed to
 
01:28:04.610 --> 01:28:04.620 align:start position:0%
be part of a drug investigation she
 
01:28:07.790 --> 01:28:07.800 align:start position:0%
herself was not suspected of any uh
 
01:28:10.189 --> 01:28:10.199 align:start position:0%
crime or any drug involvement
 
01:28:12.110 --> 01:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
and we've seen this of course in other
 
01:28:14.689 --> 01:28:14.699 align:start position:0%
cities New Hampshire for example has
 
01:28:16.790 --> 01:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
come I'm sorry New York has come under
 
01:28:19.430 --> 01:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
scrutiny for for no knock raids that
 
01:28:20.810 --> 01:28:20.820 align:start position:0%
have subjected families to being
 
01:28:22.970 --> 01:28:22.980 align:start position:0%
awakened at gunpoint including in a case
 
01:28:25.010 --> 01:28:25.020 align:start position:0%
where officers had the wrong address and
 
01:28:26.689 --> 01:28:26.699 align:start position:0%
another in which only evidence was found
 
01:28:28.970 --> 01:28:28.980 align:start position:0%
of small amount of marijuana
 
01:28:30.830 --> 01:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
so I think that the point of this bill
 
01:28:32.750 --> 01:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
is really to get
 
01:28:35.570 --> 01:28:35.580 align:start position:0%
legislators to us as a community to
 
01:28:37.189 --> 01:28:37.199 align:start position:0%
think about
 
01:28:39.770 --> 01:28:39.780 align:start position:0%
the countervailing civil liberties
 
01:28:41.689 --> 01:28:41.699 align:start position:0%
interests that come with no not grades
 
01:28:42.890 --> 01:28:42.900 align:start position:0%
because I have no doubt that you'll hear
 
01:28:44.330 --> 01:28:44.340 align:start position:0%
testimony from law enforcement today
 
01:28:46.010 --> 01:28:46.020 align:start position:0%
that these are a vital tool they're
 
01:28:48.530 --> 01:28:48.540 align:start position:0%
incredibly important they're designed to
 
01:28:50.570 --> 01:28:50.580 align:start position:0%
ensure that individuals don't destroy
 
01:28:53.390 --> 01:28:53.400 align:start position:0%
evidence before law enforcement come
 
01:28:56.209 --> 01:28:56.219 align:start position:0%
um you know I think though that there
 
01:28:58.850 --> 01:28:58.860 align:start position:0%
are real harms that we just really need
 
01:29:00.890 --> 01:29:00.900 align:start position:0%
to think about as a state and as a
 
01:29:03.410 --> 01:29:03.420 align:start position:0%
community I think this also we see this
 
01:29:05.209 --> 01:29:05.219 align:start position:0%
with respect to some concerns about
 
01:29:07.970 --> 01:29:07.980 align:start position:0%
racial disparities I don't have data in
 
01:29:09.229 --> 01:29:09.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire unfortunately about
 
01:29:11.149 --> 01:29:11.159 align:start position:0%
whether there's disparate impact as to
 
01:29:13.310 --> 01:29:13.320 align:start position:0%
how these no NOC warrants are used here
 
01:29:14.930 --> 01:29:14.940 align:start position:0%
that would be great to have that data
 
01:29:16.610 --> 01:29:16.620 align:start position:0%
but nationally there have been those
 
01:29:19.490 --> 01:29:19.500 align:start position:0%
concerns raised and so I really think
 
01:29:20.870 --> 01:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
that we should be looking at that other
 
01:29:22.850 --> 01:29:22.860 align:start position:0%
side of the equation because again it
 
01:29:25.129 --> 01:29:25.139 align:start position:0%
has been has been testified before New
 
01:29:27.590 --> 01:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there's a high rated gun
 
01:29:29.149 --> 01:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
ownership people have guns they have
 
01:29:30.890 --> 01:29:30.900 align:start position:0%
going guns lawfully it's consistent with
 
01:29:32.149 --> 01:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
their second amendment rights and when
 
01:29:34.010 --> 01:29:34.020 align:start position:0%
you allow law enforcement to barrage in
 
01:29:36.290 --> 01:29:36.300 align:start position:0%
someone's property it is reasonable for
 
01:29:37.490 --> 01:29:37.500 align:start position:0%
anyone to think
 
01:29:39.050 --> 01:29:39.060 align:start position:0%
something's breaking into my property
 
01:29:41.149 --> 01:29:41.159 align:start position:0%
and it creates I think a needless risk
 
01:29:44.450 --> 01:29:44.460 align:start position:0%
of Confrontation for uh for all involved
 
01:29:47.149 --> 01:29:47.159 align:start position:0%
and I think that is a real cost that
 
01:29:48.709 --> 01:29:48.719 align:start position:0%
needs to be part of the analysis in
 
01:29:51.050 --> 01:29:51.060 align:start position:0%
assessing whether or not as a state we
 
01:29:53.810 --> 01:29:53.820 align:start position:0%
should have these uh warrants allowed
 
01:29:55.729 --> 01:29:55.739 align:start position:0%
other states have been doing some reform
 
01:29:58.790 --> 01:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
efforts as well including including
 
01:30:00.770 --> 01:30:00.780 align:start position:0%
Oregon I understand Florida I know the
 
01:30:03.050 --> 01:30:03.060 align:start position:0%
courts have gotten involved in looking
 
01:30:05.750 --> 01:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
at this so you know our hope is that New
 
01:30:07.910 --> 01:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire becomes one of the states that
 
01:30:11.990 --> 01:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:13.570 --> 01:30:13.580 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony oh
 
01:30:16.790 --> 01:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
representative pru
 
01:30:18.709 --> 01:30:18.719 align:start position:0%
so all I've heard is the negative
 
01:30:21.649 --> 01:30:21.659 align:start position:0%
effects do you have any data on how many
 
01:30:23.450 --> 01:30:23.460 align:start position:0%
of these were successfully carried out
 
01:30:26.510 --> 01:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
and maybe prevented
 
01:30:29.570 --> 01:30:29.580 align:start position:0%
officers deaths I don't have that data
 
01:30:31.250 --> 01:30:31.260 align:start position:0%
it's also incredibly hard to prove a
 
01:30:33.350 --> 01:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
negative right
 
01:30:35.870 --> 01:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
um it's hard to evaluate and demonstrate
 
01:30:38.390 --> 01:30:38.400 align:start position:0%
I think statistically well but for this
 
01:30:39.770 --> 01:30:39.780 align:start position:0%
no knock rate someone would have
 
01:30:41.090 --> 01:30:41.100 align:start position:0%
flattered but for this Novak rate
 
01:30:42.350 --> 01:30:42.360 align:start position:0%
evidence would have been destroyed I
 
01:30:44.330 --> 01:30:44.340 align:start position:0%
don't think that actually can be proven
 
01:30:46.310 --> 01:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
because you're proving a negative what I
 
01:30:48.709 --> 01:30:48.719 align:start position:0%
can prove are the instances in which
 
01:30:50.689 --> 01:30:50.699 align:start position:0%
neuronic rates have led to real harm
 
01:30:52.990 --> 01:30:53.000 align:start position:0%
real loss of life
 
01:30:55.250 --> 01:30:55.260 align:start position:0%
and that's that's really what I think is
 
01:30:57.350 --> 01:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
so critical as part of this analysis as
 
01:30:59.629 --> 01:30:59.639 align:start position:0%
this committee evaluates the pluses and
 
01:31:04.390 --> 01:31:04.400 align:start position:0%
minuses of this particular policy
 
01:31:06.290 --> 01:31:06.300 align:start position:0%
I see
 
01:31:08.570 --> 01:31:08.580 align:start position:0%
um do you have any information on
 
01:31:10.129 --> 01:31:10.139 align:start position:0%
whether or not the Supreme Court the
 
01:31:11.629 --> 01:31:11.639 align:start position:0%
United States Supreme Court has waited
 
01:31:13.310 --> 01:31:13.320 align:start position:0%
on this issue of no knock warrants I
 
01:31:15.110 --> 01:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
don't and I I actually haven't looked at
 
01:31:16.790 --> 01:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
that so
 
01:31:19.430 --> 01:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
um I'm happy to to take a look at it if
 
01:31:20.990 --> 01:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
the committee wants but I don't sitting
 
01:31:22.970 --> 01:31:22.980 align:start position:0%
before the committee my apologies it
 
01:31:24.649 --> 01:31:24.659 align:start position:0%
would be appreciated if you could thanks
 
01:31:27.470 --> 01:31:27.480 align:start position:0%
of course representative Muse
 
01:31:29.689 --> 01:31:29.699 align:start position:0%
and just a quick question I'll ask you
 
01:31:32.330 --> 01:31:32.340 align:start position:0%
the same question I asked the uh the the
 
01:31:34.729 --> 01:31:34.739 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the legislation
 
01:31:34.739 --> 01:31:35.390 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the legislation
um

01:31:35.390 --> 01:31:35.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:37.450 --> 01:31:37.460 align:start position:0%
do we have a statute in New Hampshire
 
01:31:41.510 --> 01:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
that uh allows no knock warrants and
 
01:31:44.030 --> 01:31:44.040 align:start position:0%
would you consider the absence of a
 
01:31:46.189 --> 01:31:46.199 align:start position:0%
statute like that to be a problem given
 
01:31:49.790 --> 01:31:49.800 align:start position:0%
the fact that we seem to be doing them
 
01:31:51.709 --> 01:31:51.719 align:start position:0%
that's a great question and I don't know
 
01:31:54.110 --> 01:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
so is the idea that you're contemplating
 
01:31:56.149 --> 01:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
is that because there's no Authority
 
01:31:58.490 --> 01:31:58.500 align:start position:0%
there's no statutory recognition of this
 
01:32:00.470 --> 01:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
policy is it is it otherwise permitted
 
01:32:02.510 --> 01:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
is that the question would it be that's
 
01:32:04.669 --> 01:32:04.679 align:start position:0%
basically you know I don't I don't know
 
01:32:06.890 --> 01:32:06.900 align:start position:0%
uh and I haven't given a significant
 
01:32:08.930 --> 01:32:08.940 align:start position:0%
amount of thought to that I mean it is
 
01:32:11.450 --> 01:32:11.460 align:start position:0%
true of course that these no knock raids
 
01:32:13.790 --> 01:32:13.800 align:start position:0%
they they are they go to a court right a
 
01:32:16.370 --> 01:32:16.380 align:start position:0%
court signs off on any search warrant
 
01:32:18.290 --> 01:32:18.300 align:start position:0%
including of course a no knock search
 
01:32:20.270 --> 01:32:20.280 align:start position:0%
warrant I mean I think
 
01:32:22.729 --> 01:32:22.739 align:start position:0%
I want to say this without being overly
 
01:32:24.229 --> 01:32:24.239 align:start position:0%
critical but I think we know that most
 
01:32:26.810 --> 01:32:26.820 align:start position:0%
search warrants are are granted
 
01:32:29.270 --> 01:32:29.280 align:start position:0%
um it's not clear to me I'm not and
 
01:32:30.950 --> 01:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
maybe I'll be corrected by law
 
01:32:32.629 --> 01:32:32.639 align:start position:0%
enforcement in the room I don't know
 
01:32:34.970 --> 01:32:34.980 align:start position:0%
what precise and exacting standards
 
01:32:38.390 --> 01:32:38.400 align:start position:0%
exist with respect to how these are
 
01:32:40.310 --> 01:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
implemented or how they are sought that
 
01:32:42.590 --> 01:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
certainly hasn't been formalized by the
 
01:32:43.910 --> 01:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
legislature and maybe again that's
 
01:32:45.290 --> 01:32:45.300 align:start position:0%
something that's worth considering for
 
01:32:47.629 --> 01:32:47.639 align:start position:0%
the legislature you know given some of
 
01:32:48.709 --> 01:32:48.719 align:start position:0%
the concerns we've seen with this
 
01:32:50.629 --> 01:32:50.639 align:start position:0%
practice nationally
 
01:32:52.669 --> 01:32:52.679 align:start position:0%
and as you were answering the question I
 
01:32:54.229 --> 01:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
did see a gentleman in the back of the
 
01:32:56.390 --> 01:32:56.400 align:start position:0%
room I'm waiting on his arm going I hope
 
01:33:03.709 --> 01:33:03.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:07.729 --> 01:33:07.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:10.010 --> 01:33:10.020 align:start position:0%
do you have any comments about the
 
01:33:12.410 --> 01:33:12.420 align:start position:0%
thought that I have of
 
01:33:14.390 --> 01:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
um somehow making a warrant whatever
 
01:33:17.030 --> 01:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
warrant kind it is
 
01:33:19.790 --> 01:33:19.800 align:start position:0%
um to differentiate between the the
 
01:33:22.550 --> 01:33:22.560 align:start position:0%
purpose of the warrant is to retain
 
01:33:25.270 --> 01:33:25.280 align:start position:0%
evidence to make sure you get evidence
 
01:33:29.209 --> 01:33:29.219 align:start position:0%
or it's to have a to deal with the
 
01:33:31.729 --> 01:33:31.739 align:start position:0%
dangerous situation where the police the
 
01:33:34.669 --> 01:33:34.679 align:start position:0%
police officer's life may be in danger
 
01:33:37.610 --> 01:33:37.620 align:start position:0%
because of announcement of of who they
 
01:33:39.530 --> 01:33:39.540 align:start position:0%
are and what they're there for maybe
 
01:33:41.450 --> 01:33:41.460 align:start position:0%
because of speed or some other instance
 
01:33:44.149 --> 01:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
that might cause harm to the officer
 
01:33:45.770 --> 01:33:45.780 align:start position:0%
I'd have to give some thought to it I
 
01:33:47.689 --> 01:33:47.699 align:start position:0%
think my initial reaction is that we
 
01:33:50.330 --> 01:33:50.340 align:start position:0%
probably still have concerns with
 
01:33:50.340 --> 01:33:51.050 align:start position:0%
probably still have concerns with
um

01:33:51.050 --> 01:33:51.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:53.330 --> 01:33:53.340 align:start position:0%
a proposal that even in that instance
 
01:33:55.070 --> 01:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
narrowed the scope of no knock warrants
 
01:33:56.870 --> 01:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
I mean that that is probably the primary
 
01:33:58.729 --> 01:33:58.739 align:start position:0%
justification right now for most no
 
01:34:01.310 --> 01:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
knock warrants and I think we've seen
 
01:34:03.350 --> 01:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
even with that you know some some
 
01:34:05.330 --> 01:34:05.340 align:start position:0%
devastating consequences that again we
 
01:34:06.649 --> 01:34:06.659 align:start position:0%
as an organization continue to have
 
01:34:11.149 --> 01:34:11.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:12.649 --> 01:34:12.659 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman thank
 
01:34:16.030 --> 01:34:16.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:26.030 --> 01:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:27.649 --> 01:34:27.659 align:start position:0%
thank you committee chair thank you
 
01:34:29.209 --> 01:34:29.219 align:start position:0%
committee members my name is Russian
 
01:34:31.129 --> 01:34:31.139 align:start position:0%
Chester I'm from Bedford New Hampshire
 
01:34:32.750 --> 01:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
and I'm coming from a very different
 
01:34:35.689 --> 01:34:35.699 align:start position:0%
point that I think is important is that
 
01:34:38.510 --> 01:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
anytime there's a no knock situation I
 
01:34:40.790 --> 01:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
worked for dcyf for a number of years I
 
01:34:42.890 --> 01:34:42.900 align:start position:0%
went with police to remove children from
 
01:34:45.050 --> 01:34:45.060 align:start position:0%
homes without parents knowledge that was
 
01:34:47.209 --> 01:34:47.219 align:start position:0%
traumatizing for everyone involved it
 
01:34:48.950 --> 01:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
was traumatizing for the case manager
 
01:34:51.410 --> 01:34:51.420 align:start position:0%
for the children for the parents and the
 
01:34:53.870 --> 01:34:53.880 align:start position:0%
officers that accompanied us when we're
 
01:34:56.090 --> 01:34:56.100 align:start position:0%
whenever we're dealing with a high
 
01:34:59.689 --> 01:34:59.699 align:start position:0%
emotional situation the risk of danger
 
01:35:02.390 --> 01:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
for everyone involved both physically
 
01:35:05.750 --> 01:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
and emotionally is much greater so my
 
01:35:08.030 --> 01:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
concerns with the no knock warrants is
 
01:35:10.850 --> 01:35:10.860 align:start position:0%
primarily that is that all of us are
 
01:35:13.149 --> 01:35:13.159 align:start position:0%
looking at the physical
 
01:35:15.530 --> 01:35:15.540 align:start position:0%
aspects of the trauma but there's an
 
01:35:17.930 --> 01:35:17.940 align:start position:0%
emotional aspect too that needs to be
 
01:35:20.030 --> 01:35:20.040 align:start position:0%
considered during this process the
 
01:35:22.970 --> 01:35:22.980 align:start position:0%
bottom line is when someone hit when an
 
01:35:25.490 --> 01:35:25.500 align:start position:0%
officer kills someone in Duty they live
 
01:35:26.930 --> 01:35:26.940 align:start position:0%
with that for the rest of their life
 
01:35:30.350 --> 01:35:30.360 align:start position:0%
whether it was justified or not they
 
01:35:32.450 --> 01:35:32.460 align:start position:0%
still took the life of another human
 
01:35:35.209 --> 01:35:35.219 align:start position:0%
being and on the other coin when someone
 
01:35:36.830 --> 01:35:36.840 align:start position:0%
feels that they're protecting their
 
01:35:39.350 --> 01:35:39.360 align:start position:0%
family or their home or their children
 
01:35:42.649 --> 01:35:42.659 align:start position:0%
and they take someone's life in most
 
01:35:44.930 --> 01:35:44.940 align:start position:0%
cases they live with that for the rest
 
01:35:46.129 --> 01:35:46.139 align:start position:0%
of their lives
 
01:35:48.110 --> 01:35:48.120 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to bring that up to you
 
01:35:51.350 --> 01:35:51.360 align:start position:0%
folks as a point of order
 
01:35:53.390 --> 01:35:53.400 align:start position:0%
representative Newell
 
01:35:55.129 --> 01:35:55.139 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you so much
 
01:35:56.870 --> 01:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
for taking my question appreciate you
 
01:35:58.310 --> 01:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
being here today
 
01:36:01.070 --> 01:36:01.080 align:start position:0%
um I'm wondering especially to um the
 
01:36:02.810 --> 01:36:02.820 align:start position:0%
the trauma Factor
 
01:36:04.850 --> 01:36:04.860 align:start position:0%
um as you're describing do you think
 
01:36:06.950 --> 01:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
that or I guess my question for you is
 
01:36:08.510 --> 01:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
in your experience what was the
 
01:36:11.030 --> 01:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
threshold for doing something like that
 
01:36:12.950 --> 01:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
for for approaching it in that way where
 
01:36:16.250 --> 01:36:16.260 align:start position:0%
you needed to go in uh in this in this
 
01:36:17.870 --> 01:36:17.880 align:start position:0%
type of way and
 
01:36:19.850 --> 01:36:19.860 align:start position:0%
um and to take a child you know what I
 
01:36:22.669 --> 01:36:22.679 align:start position:0%
mean intervene in a situation so in
 
01:36:25.310 --> 01:36:25.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question in most of
 
01:36:26.629 --> 01:36:26.639 align:start position:0%
those cases
 
01:36:31.189 --> 01:36:31.199 align:start position:0%
someone made the determination that the
 
01:36:32.750 --> 01:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
family was either a high risk for
 
01:36:35.209 --> 01:36:35.219 align:start position:0%
running the child was in immediate
 
01:36:35.219 --> 01:36:36.830 align:start position:0%
running the child was in immediate
danger

01:36:36.830 --> 01:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
danger
 
01:36:36.840 --> 01:36:38.870 align:start position:0%
danger
um

01:36:38.870 --> 01:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:42.050 --> 01:36:42.060 align:start position:0%
and in some cases it may have been
 
01:36:42.060 --> 01:36:43.550 align:start position:0%
and in some cases it may have been
warranted

01:36:43.550 --> 01:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
warranted
 
01:36:47.750 --> 01:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
but in most cases what we found what I
 
01:36:50.330 --> 01:36:50.340 align:start position:0%
found and what our officers found is
 
01:36:52.669 --> 01:36:52.679 align:start position:0%
that we really didn't need to do it the
 
01:36:54.950 --> 01:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
way we did it we did it based on the
 
01:36:56.810 --> 01:36:56.820 align:start position:0%
information we had and that information
 
01:37:00.649 --> 01:37:00.659 align:start position:0%
wasn't always accurate and up to date
 
01:37:04.910 --> 01:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:06.470 --> 01:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony you're
 
01:37:12.649 --> 01:37:12.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:14.990 --> 01:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
and the chair recognizes Mark Harrington
 
01:37:37.010 --> 01:37:37.020 align:start position:0%

I've also been a member of

01:38:07.430 --> 01:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
I've also been a member of my department

SWAT team for the last 13 years the last

three of which I've served as a team

leader I'd like to thank you for the
 
01:38:14.629 --> 01:38:14.639 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak before you today in
 
01:38:17.450 --> 01:38:17.460 align:start position:0%
opposition of House Bill 135 on behalf
 
01:38:19.850 --> 01:38:19.860 align:start position:0%
of my department and is also the New
 
01:38:21.290 --> 01:38:21.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of chiefs of
 
01:38:21.300 --> 01:38:22.189 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of chiefs of
police

01:38:22.189 --> 01:38:22.199 align:start position:0%
police
 
01:38:24.050 --> 01:38:24.060 align:start position:0%
I'm going to speak about no knock
 
01:38:25.790 --> 01:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
warrants and knock and announce warrants
 
01:38:27.290 --> 01:38:27.300 align:start position:0%
both of which I have extensive personal
 
01:38:28.610 --> 01:38:28.620 align:start position:0%
experience with
 
01:38:30.290 --> 01:38:30.300 align:start position:0%
unfortunately no knock warrants have
 
01:38:31.550 --> 01:38:31.560 align:start position:0%
recently gained negative national
 
01:38:34.070 --> 01:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
attention due to a few tragic incidents
 
01:38:35.570 --> 01:38:35.580 align:start position:0%
that have occurred outside of the State
 
01:38:36.590 --> 01:38:36.600 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire
 
01:38:38.870 --> 01:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
no knock warrant is a search warrant
 
01:38:41.330 --> 01:38:41.340 align:start position:0%
authorized authorizing highly trained
 
01:38:43.490 --> 01:38:43.500 align:start position:0%
police officers to enter an identified
 
01:38:45.410 --> 01:38:45.420 align:start position:0%
premise without first knocking
 
01:38:47.510 --> 01:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
announcing their presence and purpose
 
01:38:49.250 --> 01:38:49.260 align:start position:0%
no knock warrants are intelligence
 
01:38:51.350 --> 01:38:51.360 align:start position:0%
driven meaning that investigation has
 
01:38:53.570 --> 01:38:53.580 align:start position:0%
led to to extensive research
 
01:38:55.790 --> 01:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
surveillance and intelligence that has
 
01:38:57.470 --> 01:38:57.480 align:start position:0%
been obtained requiring the no knock
 
01:38:57.480 --> 01:38:58.430 align:start position:0%
been obtained requiring the no knock
warrant

01:38:58.430 --> 01:38:58.440 align:start position:0%
warrant
 
01:39:00.590 --> 01:39:00.600 align:start position:0%
this information usually identifies that
 
01:39:02.390 --> 01:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
the suspect is likely to be armed with a
 
01:39:04.610 --> 01:39:04.620 align:start position:0%
deadly weapon has made statements of
 
01:39:06.649 --> 01:39:06.659 align:start position:0%
resistance has fortified their premise
 
01:39:08.090 --> 01:39:08.100 align:start position:0%
and has surveillance systems or
 
01:39:09.530 --> 01:39:09.540 align:start position:0%
aggressive animals
 
01:39:11.149 --> 01:39:11.159 align:start position:0%
no knock warrants provide police
 
01:39:13.970 --> 01:39:13.980 align:start position:0%
officers with inner structural control
 
01:39:15.830 --> 01:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
while clearly identifying themselves
 
01:39:17.870 --> 01:39:17.880 align:start position:0%
which is a key Advantage when executing
 
01:39:19.070 --> 01:39:19.080 align:start position:0%
these warrants
 
01:39:21.410 --> 01:39:21.420 align:start position:0%
this tactic is used without the intent
 
01:39:23.090 --> 01:39:23.100 align:start position:0%
of keeping the suspect from arming
 
01:39:25.189 --> 01:39:25.199 align:start position:0%
themselves and harming others within the
 
01:39:28.850 --> 01:39:28.860 align:start position:0%
premise or fleeing upon police arrival
 
01:39:30.950 --> 01:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
upon executing a no knock warrant loud
 
01:39:32.990 --> 01:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
PA announcements are immediately made by
 
01:39:34.850 --> 01:39:34.860 align:start position:0%
law enforcement clearly identifying
 
01:39:37.189 --> 01:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
themselves as police to the suspect and
 
01:39:38.570 --> 01:39:38.580 align:start position:0%
the surrounding community
 
01:39:40.490 --> 01:39:40.500 align:start position:0%
no knock warrants are highly effective
 
01:39:42.530 --> 01:39:42.540 align:start position:0%
and when executed properly provide the
 
01:39:44.649 --> 01:39:44.659 align:start position:0%
highest level of safety to the public
 
01:39:47.810 --> 01:39:47.820 align:start position:0%
officers and suspects although a no
 
01:39:49.490 --> 01:39:49.500 align:start position:0%
knock warrant allows for officers to
 
01:39:51.649 --> 01:39:51.659 align:start position:0%
enter a premises and execute a warrant
 
01:39:54.470 --> 01:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
it has more complex tactics and decision
 
01:39:56.510 --> 01:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
making involved depending on the
 
01:39:58.070 --> 01:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
intelligence gathered law enforcement
 
01:40:00.229 --> 01:40:00.239 align:start position:0%
May utilize a breach and hold tactic a
 
01:40:01.729 --> 01:40:01.739 align:start position:0%
first room entry
 
01:40:03.830 --> 01:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
or potentially a fluid dynamic entry
 
01:40:06.470 --> 01:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
these key the key point is that law
 
01:40:08.510 --> 01:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement has options dependent on the
 
01:40:10.189 --> 01:40:10.199 align:start position:0%
situation intelligence and safety
 
01:40:10.199 --> 01:40:11.390 align:start position:0%
situation intelligence and safety
concerns

01:40:11.390 --> 01:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
01:40:13.129 --> 01:40:13.139 align:start position:0%
a knock and announce warrant is a search
 
01:40:14.689 --> 01:40:14.699 align:start position:0%
warrant requiring police officers to
 
01:40:16.129 --> 01:40:16.139 align:start position:0%
First knock and announce their presence
 
01:40:18.229 --> 01:40:18.239 align:start position:0%
and purpose prior to entering the
 
01:40:20.450 --> 01:40:20.460 align:start position:0%
premise a key issue with a knock and
 
01:40:21.950 --> 01:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
announce warrant is that it gives
 
01:40:23.750 --> 01:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
suspects time to arm and potentially
 
01:40:25.010 --> 01:40:25.020 align:start position:0%
attack police
 
01:40:26.689 --> 01:40:26.699 align:start position:0%
as seen in Philadelphia just three
 
01:40:29.209 --> 01:40:29.219 align:start position:0%
months ago with three Philadelphia SWAT
 
01:40:30.530 --> 01:40:30.540 align:start position:0%
offices was shot through the front door
 
01:40:32.090 --> 01:40:32.100 align:start position:0%
and window of the residence by the
 
01:40:34.910 --> 01:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
suspect it allows suspects to take time
 
01:40:37.430 --> 01:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
potentially take innocent victims inside
 
01:40:39.890 --> 01:40:39.900 align:start position:0%
the premise hostage or inflect injury
 
01:40:42.830 --> 01:40:42.840 align:start position:0%
upon themselves or a third party
 
01:40:45.350 --> 01:40:45.360 align:start position:0%
if House Bill 135 were to pass offices
 
01:40:47.450 --> 01:40:47.460 align:start position:0%
would not have the option to execute a
 
01:40:49.129 --> 01:40:49.139 align:start position:0%
no knock search warrant and would be
 
01:40:50.570 --> 01:40:50.580 align:start position:0%
held to a knock and announced warrant
 
01:40:50.580 --> 01:40:51.530 align:start position:0%
held to a knock and announced warrant
only

01:40:51.530 --> 01:40:51.540 align:start position:0%
only
 
01:40:53.390 --> 01:40:53.400 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire tax fuel teams across
 
01:40:54.709 --> 01:40:54.719 align:start position:0%
the state take great pride in their
 
01:40:56.930 --> 01:40:56.940 align:start position:0%
investigations preparation and execution
 
01:40:58.370 --> 01:40:58.380 align:start position:0%
of these warrants
 
01:41:00.350 --> 01:41:00.360 align:start position:0%
I speak from personal experience when I
 
01:41:01.790 --> 01:41:01.800 align:start position:0%
say that I've seen the benefits of a
 
01:41:03.950 --> 01:41:03.960 align:start position:0%
known Arc warrant in which a suspect has
 
01:41:06.410 --> 01:41:06.420 align:start position:0%
attempted on themselves upon police
 
01:41:06.420 --> 01:41:07.610 align:start position:0%
attempted on themselves upon police
arrival

01:41:07.610 --> 01:41:07.620 align:start position:0%
arrival
 
01:41:09.830 --> 01:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
if a no knock warrant had been executed
 
01:41:11.930 --> 01:41:11.940 align:start position:0%
the result of the investigation could
 
01:41:13.189 --> 01:41:13.199 align:start position:0%
have ended with a lethal engagement
 
01:41:15.110 --> 01:41:15.120 align:start position:0%
instead of a peaceful surrender
 
01:41:17.390 --> 01:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
in closing I see you find Hospital 135
 
01:41:19.250 --> 01:41:19.260 align:start position:0%
in expedient to legislate and I
 
01:41:20.450 --> 01:41:20.460 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time thank you for
 
01:41:20.460 --> 01:41:22.010 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time thank you for
consideration

01:41:22.010 --> 01:41:22.020 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
01:41:24.050 --> 01:41:24.060 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony could you
 
01:41:26.090 --> 01:41:26.100 align:start position:0%
explain to the committee the judicial
 
01:41:28.729 --> 01:41:28.739 align:start position:0%
review process required to obtain such a
 
01:41:31.189 --> 01:41:31.199 align:start position:0%
warrant the level of versus a knock and
 
01:41:33.709 --> 01:41:33.719 align:start position:0%
announce and also if there's any
 
01:41:35.990 --> 01:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
difference on the search warrant return
 
01:41:38.689 --> 01:41:38.699 align:start position:0%
well I can't obviously speak to as far
 
01:41:40.970 --> 01:41:40.980 align:start position:0%
as through the judge's eyes who would be
 
01:41:42.890 --> 01:41:42.900 align:start position:0%
signing it but as far as the department
 
01:41:44.810 --> 01:41:44.820 align:start position:0%
I can speak a little bit more educated
 
01:41:46.189 --> 01:41:46.199 align:start position:0%
than just
 
01:41:49.370 --> 01:41:49.380 align:start position:0%
any any police officer as I worked five
 
01:41:50.870 --> 01:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
years in the drug unit on my department
 
01:41:53.209 --> 01:41:53.219 align:start position:0%
as well so I kind of saw it from
 
01:41:55.129 --> 01:41:55.139 align:start position:0%
not only the Tactical side of things but
 
01:41:58.310 --> 01:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
also the investigatory side of things
 
01:42:00.290 --> 01:42:00.300 align:start position:0%
I can speak for the Manchester Police
 
01:42:03.830 --> 01:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
Department for sure that we take our due
 
01:42:06.649 --> 01:42:06.659 align:start position:0%
diligence and time there is no uh
 
01:42:08.990 --> 01:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
set time frame two weeks a month three
 
01:42:11.209 --> 01:42:11.219 align:start position:0%
months of of the investigation but we do
 
01:42:11.219 --> 01:42:12.649 align:start position:0%
months of of the investigation but we do
have

01:42:12.649 --> 01:42:12.659 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:42:14.810 --> 01:42:14.820 align:start position:0%
I would say like levels of intelligence
 
01:42:17.030 --> 01:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
that we need to receive for instance we
 
01:42:18.649 --> 01:42:18.659 align:start position:0%
need to see the people leaving and
 
01:42:21.169 --> 01:42:21.179 align:start position:0%
exiting through a particular door we
 
01:42:23.090 --> 01:42:23.100 align:start position:0%
need to have the idea of not only the
 
01:42:26.090 --> 01:42:26.100 align:start position:0%
building but potentially the exact uh
 
01:42:28.070 --> 01:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
apartment door that they go in that's
 
01:42:29.870 --> 01:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
done with different surveillance tactics
 
01:42:32.149 --> 01:42:32.159 align:start position:0%
undercover operations and whatnot we
 
01:42:32.159 --> 01:42:33.290 align:start position:0%
undercover operations and whatnot we
don't

01:42:33.290 --> 01:42:33.300 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:42:35.270 --> 01:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
it's not a one-trick pony so to speak
 
01:42:37.609 --> 01:42:37.619 align:start position:0%
that we don't only do one particular
 
01:42:39.050 --> 01:42:39.060 align:start position:0%
thing and that covers Us for everything
 
01:42:42.530 --> 01:42:42.540 align:start position:0%
but we have a a wide variety of tools
 
01:42:44.450 --> 01:42:44.460 align:start position:0%
that we utilize to get the proper
 
01:42:44.460 --> 01:42:45.649 align:start position:0%
that we utilize to get the proper
intelligence

01:42:45.649 --> 01:42:45.659 align:start position:0%
intelligence
 
01:42:48.590 --> 01:42:48.600 align:start position:0%
that makes us feel comfortable with that
 
01:42:50.510 --> 01:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
is the that is the address that is the
 
01:42:52.850 --> 01:42:52.860 align:start position:0%
door those are the people and in that
 
01:42:56.270 --> 01:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
intelligence gathering we get gather the
 
01:42:58.609 --> 01:42:58.619 align:start position:0%
um the other information such as
 
01:43:01.550 --> 01:43:01.560 align:start position:0%
children animals other people that are
 
01:43:04.430 --> 01:43:04.440 align:start position:0%
coming and going to the point where we
 
01:43:07.129 --> 01:43:07.139 align:start position:0%
have gut it down if there are if there
 
01:43:09.530 --> 01:43:09.540 align:start position:0%
are children involved what what time do
 
01:43:11.570 --> 01:43:11.580 align:start position:0%
they leave to go to school and we can we
 
01:43:14.870 --> 01:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
can tailor our timing around that
 
01:43:17.030 --> 01:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
particular situation
 
01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:18.050 align:start position:0%
particular situation
um

01:43:18.050 --> 01:43:18.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:20.750 --> 01:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
we do do a threat assessment as well
 
01:43:24.050 --> 01:43:24.060 align:start position:0%
prior to anything which a person needs
 
01:43:25.970 --> 01:43:25.980 align:start position:0%
to score into a certain level based on
 
01:43:27.649 --> 01:43:27.659 align:start position:0%
their prior criminal history the
 
01:43:28.910 --> 01:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
intelligence driven through the
 
01:43:30.649 --> 01:43:30.659 align:start position:0%
investigation are they armed do they
 
01:43:33.050 --> 01:43:33.060 align:start position:0%
have a history of having weapons as
 
01:43:35.149 --> 01:43:35.159 align:start position:0%
their premise fortified there's a
 
01:43:37.070 --> 01:43:37.080 align:start position:0%
there's a list of uh that we go through
 
01:43:39.350 --> 01:43:39.360 align:start position:0%
on that and the person necessitates a
 
01:43:41.450 --> 01:43:41.460 align:start position:0%
particular score where the SWAT team
 
01:43:43.910 --> 01:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
would be utilized for that
 
01:43:48.169 --> 01:43:48.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:50.510 --> 01:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
the rationale behind it like I said is
 
01:43:52.910 --> 01:43:52.920 align:start position:0%
we're not going
 
01:43:55.790 --> 01:43:55.800 align:start position:0%
um to utilize the SWAT team unless the
 
01:43:58.550 --> 01:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
threat Matrix is there and we feel that
 
01:44:00.169 --> 01:44:00.179 align:start position:0%
it's necessary that we utilize that
 
01:44:00.179 --> 01:44:01.490 align:start position:0%
it's necessary that we utilize that
tactic

01:44:01.490 --> 01:44:01.500 align:start position:0%
tactic
 
01:44:03.350 --> 01:44:03.360 align:start position:0%
I guess what I'm asking though is in the
 
01:44:05.330 --> 01:44:05.340 align:start position:0%
search warrant application does the
 
01:44:07.370 --> 01:44:07.380 align:start position:0%
court require a higher standard from you
 
01:44:09.470 --> 01:44:09.480 align:start position:0%
to get a no knock versus a standard not
 
01:44:12.169 --> 01:44:12.179 align:start position:0%
going to announce warrant no I mean it
 
01:44:13.490 --> 01:44:13.500 align:start position:0%
could be offered back if it was
 
01:44:16.370 --> 01:44:16.380 align:start position:0%
necessary in my experience
 
01:44:19.010 --> 01:44:19.020 align:start position:0%
when we apply for the search warrant it
 
01:44:21.649 --> 01:44:21.659 align:start position:0%
comes back as that way
 
01:44:23.930 --> 01:44:23.940 align:start position:0%
so you apply specifically for a no-noc
 
01:44:23.940 --> 01:44:24.950 align:start position:0%
so you apply specifically for a no-noc
warrant

01:44:24.950 --> 01:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
warrant
 
01:44:26.990 --> 01:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
not just a search warrant you have to no
 
01:44:28.850 --> 01:44:28.860 align:start position:0%
we apply for the search warrant and it's
 
01:44:31.310 --> 01:44:31.320 align:start position:0%
it's granted unless they the the judge
 
01:44:33.410 --> 01:44:33.420 align:start position:0%
comes back in in his questioning and
 
01:44:36.830 --> 01:44:36.840 align:start position:0%
feels is it necessary to do this uh
 
01:44:38.930 --> 01:44:38.940 align:start position:0%
if he has a question on the rationale
 
01:44:40.189 --> 01:44:40.199 align:start position:0%
behind the search warrant I guess it's
 
01:44:44.810 --> 01:44:44.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:46.729 --> 01:44:46.739 align:start position:0%
representative Pratt
 
01:44:50.209 --> 01:44:50.219 align:start position:0%
in one of these no knock situations
 
01:44:51.590 --> 01:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
um you knock on the door you break the
 
01:44:53.990 --> 01:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
door down you walk in yeah there's a
 
01:44:55.490 --> 01:44:55.500 align:start position:0%
German Shepherd or a dog inside the door
 
01:44:58.250 --> 01:44:58.260 align:start position:0%
how do you uh handle that how would you
 
01:45:00.350 --> 01:45:00.360 align:start position:0%
handle that I know my dog protects my
 
01:45:02.330 --> 01:45:02.340 align:start position:0%
house from grade school so if somebody's
 
01:45:05.209 --> 01:45:05.219 align:start position:0%
kicking the front door down to back up I
 
01:45:08.450 --> 01:45:08.460 align:start position:0%
apologize yes and it's kind of a archaic
 
01:45:10.070 --> 01:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
way of putting it that way that we walk
 
01:45:11.930 --> 01:45:11.940 align:start position:0%
up we knock on the door we break the
 
01:45:14.090 --> 01:45:14.100 align:start position:0%
door down and then we walk in okay
 
01:45:16.970 --> 01:45:16.980 align:start position:0%
um like I testified to it depends on the
 
01:45:18.830 --> 01:45:18.840 align:start position:0%
situation we would have normally the
 
01:45:20.270 --> 01:45:20.280 align:start position:0%
intelligence of weathers or dog because
 
01:45:22.250 --> 01:45:22.260 align:start position:0%
if you have a large Shepherd you have
 
01:45:23.930 --> 01:45:23.940 align:start position:0%
been taking that dog outside to use the
 
01:45:25.370 --> 01:45:25.380 align:start position:0%
bathroom and during surveillance right
 
01:45:27.530 --> 01:45:27.540 align:start position:0%
or the intelligence driven we would have
 
01:45:29.750 --> 01:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
that and we would prefer prepare for
 
01:45:32.450 --> 01:45:32.460 align:start position:0%
that often we use fire extinguishers
 
01:45:34.189 --> 01:45:34.199 align:start position:0%
which work very well if the dog becomes
 
01:45:36.530 --> 01:45:36.540 align:start position:0%
aggressive we also have two Animal
 
01:45:38.090 --> 01:45:38.100 align:start position:0%
Control offices in the city and if we
 
01:45:40.070 --> 01:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
feel it's a situation like that we have
 
01:45:42.410 --> 01:45:42.420 align:start position:0%
brought them out not necessarily right
 
01:45:43.910 --> 01:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
with us up to the house but had them
 
01:45:46.129 --> 01:45:46.139 align:start position:0%
back in case we needed to utilize a
 
01:45:47.750 --> 01:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
snare or some something like that to
 
01:45:50.090 --> 01:45:50.100 align:start position:0%
make it a more safe situation for the
 
01:45:51.830 --> 01:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
animal for the people inside for us as
 
01:45:54.770 --> 01:45:54.780 align:start position:0%
well but there are options that we have
 
01:45:56.930 --> 01:45:56.940 align:start position:0%
it's not just a
 
01:46:00.709 --> 01:46:00.719 align:start position:0%
any type of a lethal situation it's we
 
01:46:02.510 --> 01:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
truly do try to prepare for every
 
01:46:05.870 --> 01:46:05.880 align:start position:0%
scenario and have contingencies for as
 
01:46:08.030 --> 01:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
many issues as we can think of going
 
01:46:10.129 --> 01:46:10.139 align:start position:0%
into a situation
 
01:46:11.810 --> 01:46:11.820 align:start position:0%
I like to apologize I didn't mean to
 
01:46:13.370 --> 01:46:13.380 align:start position:0%
insult anybody by saying you'd kick the
 
01:46:16.430 --> 01:46:16.440 align:start position:0%
door down but at no knock entry
 
01:46:18.050 --> 01:46:18.060 align:start position:0%
you're not you're not somebody's not
 
01:46:19.250 --> 01:46:19.260 align:start position:0%
opening the door for you to come in
 
01:46:22.430 --> 01:46:22.440 align:start position:0%
right well correct we're not knocking on
 
01:46:25.669 --> 01:46:25.679 align:start position:0%
a no knock right so where the door gets
 
01:46:29.270 --> 01:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
opened I guess my point is the tactic of
 
01:46:32.030 --> 01:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
us just going into the house isn't a 100
 
01:46:32.040 --> 01:46:34.370 align:start position:0%
us just going into the house isn't a 100
standard

01:46:34.370 --> 01:46:34.380 align:start position:0%
standard
 
01:46:37.310 --> 01:46:37.320 align:start position:0%
the the true tactic that we utilize more
 
01:46:40.430 --> 01:46:40.440 align:start position:0%
often than not is a breach and hold
 
01:46:43.370 --> 01:46:43.380 align:start position:0%
where the door will get opened
 
01:46:45.590 --> 01:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
um and at that point we get to see
 
01:46:48.109 --> 01:46:48.119 align:start position:0%
inside the structure we get to make our
 
01:46:49.970 --> 01:46:49.980 align:start position:0%
announcements as far as who we are what
 
01:46:52.910 --> 01:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
we're there for and now we can see
 
01:46:55.970 --> 01:46:55.980 align:start position:0%
whether we are utilizing the solely the
 
01:46:58.370 --> 01:46:58.380 align:start position:0%
door have we breached a window as well
 
01:47:00.669 --> 01:47:00.679 align:start position:0%
and Ray can break the window to get
 
01:47:03.410 --> 01:47:03.420 align:start position:0%
proper control over what we can inside
 
01:47:05.390 --> 01:47:05.400 align:start position:0%
the house without
 
01:47:06.830 --> 01:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
putting people In Harm's Way
 
01:47:08.750 --> 01:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily by rushing into the house
 
01:47:08.760 --> 01:47:10.030 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily by rushing into the house
and

01:47:10.030 --> 01:47:10.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:47:12.709 --> 01:47:12.719 align:start position:0%
we can control a lot from the outside of
 
01:47:14.689 --> 01:47:14.699 align:start position:0%
the structure but the key point is to
 
01:47:17.350 --> 01:47:17.360 align:start position:0%
get that reach point where we can see
 
01:47:21.770 --> 01:47:21.780 align:start position:0%
the movements or stop the movements uh
 
01:47:23.510 --> 01:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
control what's going on the best of our
 
01:47:25.970 --> 01:47:25.980 align:start position:0%
ability which creates a much more safe
 
01:47:28.669 --> 01:47:28.679 align:start position:0%
environment for everyone involved thank
 
01:47:28.679 --> 01:47:29.830 align:start position:0%
environment for everyone involved thank
you

01:47:29.830 --> 01:47:29.840 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:47:32.090 --> 01:47:32.100 align:start position:0%
representative Newman
 
01:47:33.830 --> 01:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
just a clarification on your last
 
01:47:36.830 --> 01:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
statement if you if you get an Open Door
 
01:47:38.930 --> 01:47:38.940 align:start position:0%
how do you get in that circumstances if
 
01:47:42.290 --> 01:47:42.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:45.410 --> 01:47:45.420 align:start position:0%
if if we were to open the door you mean
 
01:47:47.090 --> 01:47:47.100 align:start position:0%
if you could just open is that what you
 
01:47:48.470 --> 01:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
mean you just could open the door if the
 
01:47:50.209 --> 01:47:50.219 align:start position:0%
door was unlocked and you did that I
 
01:47:53.930 --> 01:47:53.940 align:start position:0%
mean we do that on in breaching if if we
 
01:47:56.350 --> 01:47:56.360 align:start position:0%
have a no knock search warrant
 
01:47:59.390 --> 01:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
we still always try the door handle
 
01:48:01.070 --> 01:48:01.080 align:start position:0%
because it facilitates things you don't
 
01:48:02.270 --> 01:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
have to break and damage everything
 
01:48:04.010 --> 01:48:04.020 align:start position:0%
that's not the goal the goal is to get
 
01:48:05.930 --> 01:48:05.940 align:start position:0%
the door open the easiest way to open a
 
01:48:07.729 --> 01:48:07.739 align:start position:0%
door is to turn the knob and push it
 
01:48:10.129 --> 01:48:10.139 align:start position:0%
open if we can just to follow up
 
01:48:12.830 --> 01:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
so that's uh so that's is that the only
 
01:48:14.870 --> 01:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
situation where you get the door open
 
01:48:16.669 --> 01:48:16.679 align:start position:0%
you were just able to do that without
 
01:48:19.310 --> 01:48:19.320 align:start position:0%
damage and then you could surveil no I
 
01:48:22.070 --> 01:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
mean obviously it's it's terrific if all
 
01:48:24.050 --> 01:48:24.060 align:start position:0%
the doors are left wide open but the the
 
01:48:25.910 --> 01:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
doors are off and locked and if they are
 
01:48:27.890 --> 01:48:27.900 align:start position:0%
we would utilize some type of breaching
 
01:48:31.570 --> 01:48:31.580 align:start position:0%
technique to get the door open thank you
 
01:48:33.830 --> 01:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
representative Muse
 
01:48:36.410 --> 01:48:36.420 align:start position:0%
yes and and uh excuse me I have a little
 
01:48:37.790 --> 01:48:37.800 align:start position:0%
bit of a hearing issue and sometimes
 
01:48:39.229 --> 01:48:39.239 align:start position:0%
you're a little bit far away from the
 
01:48:39.239 --> 01:48:40.250 align:start position:0%
you're a little bit far away from the
mic

01:48:40.250 --> 01:48:40.260 align:start position:0%
mic
 
01:48:41.870 --> 01:48:41.880 align:start position:0%
um but I just want to make sure I heard
 
01:48:43.790 --> 01:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
something that I thought you said uh
 
01:48:45.830 --> 01:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
that I got it correctly
 
01:48:47.870 --> 01:48:47.880 align:start position:0%
um I thought I heard you say heard you
 
01:48:49.729 --> 01:48:49.739 align:start position:0%
say that when you apply for a search
 
01:48:53.270 --> 01:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
warrant there is no uh special process
 
01:48:55.370 --> 01:48:55.380 align:start position:0%
or additional evidentiary requirement
 
01:48:59.090 --> 01:48:59.100 align:start position:0%
that you have in order to turn this from
 
01:49:02.090 --> 01:49:02.100 align:start position:0%
just a regular search process into a no
 
01:49:04.609 --> 01:49:04.619 align:start position:0%
knock search it sounds like you have the
 
01:49:05.870 --> 01:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
discretion to make that decision
 
01:49:05.880 --> 01:49:07.430 align:start position:0%
discretion to make that decision
yourself

01:49:07.430 --> 01:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
yourself
 
01:49:10.370 --> 01:49:10.380 align:start position:0%
we can make this if it's not required
 
01:49:13.609 --> 01:49:13.619 align:start position:0%
but as I said when the SWAT team gets
 
01:49:17.209 --> 01:49:17.219 align:start position:0%
gets utilized on warrant services
 
01:49:19.669 --> 01:49:19.679 align:start position:0%
they're bringing us in because there are
 
01:49:22.070 --> 01:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
special circumstances and more so those
 
01:49:25.189 --> 01:49:25.199 align:start position:0%
circumstances are the potential violence
 
01:49:27.290 --> 01:49:27.300 align:start position:0%
or um
 
01:49:30.169 --> 01:49:30.179 align:start position:0%
guns illegal guns and situations that
 
01:49:32.870 --> 01:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
could be uh facing
 
01:49:35.810 --> 01:49:35.820 align:start position:0%
law enforcement to go to that residence
 
01:49:39.470 --> 01:49:39.480 align:start position:0%
so the requirement of the no knock is
 
01:49:41.090 --> 01:49:41.100 align:start position:0%
something that we
 
01:49:41.100 --> 01:49:41.930 align:start position:0%
something that we
um

01:49:41.930 --> 01:49:41.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:44.810 --> 01:49:44.820 align:start position:0%
it has to rise to that level for us not
 
01:49:46.910 --> 01:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
number one just to be utilized as a SWAT
 
01:49:46.920 --> 01:49:47.990 align:start position:0%
number one just to be utilized as a SWAT
team

01:49:47.990 --> 01:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
team
 
01:49:51.470 --> 01:49:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:54.649 --> 01:49:54.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:56.330 --> 01:49:56.340 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question thank
 
01:49:57.770 --> 01:49:57.780 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman
 
01:49:59.870 --> 01:49:59.880 align:start position:0%
a judge would still have to approve a
 
01:50:01.370 --> 01:50:01.380 align:start position:0%
no-nock warrant that's not something you
 
01:50:03.229 --> 01:50:03.239 align:start position:0%
do on your own correct correction okay
 
01:50:06.229 --> 01:50:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:09.229 --> 01:50:09.239 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler Mr chairman I'd
 
01:50:11.209 --> 01:50:11.219 align:start position:0%
like you to elaborate on what type of
 
01:50:14.090 --> 01:50:14.100 align:start position:0%
criminal what crime most often warrants
 
01:50:17.689 --> 01:50:17.699 align:start position:0%
a no knock search in your experience
 
01:50:19.729 --> 01:50:19.739 align:start position:0%
but more often than not
 
01:50:23.810 --> 01:50:23.820 align:start position:0%
um we see a gun and Drug crimes in the
 
01:50:25.729 --> 01:50:25.739 align:start position:0%
city of Manchester where we're going to
 
01:50:29.149 --> 01:50:29.159 align:start position:0%
these addresses and being utilized and
 
01:50:32.149 --> 01:50:32.159 align:start position:0%
to also fall back on the threat
 
01:50:35.930 --> 01:50:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:37.850 --> 01:50:37.860 align:start position:0%
situations that are going to get you a
 
01:50:39.729 --> 01:50:39.739 align:start position:0%
higher score at the the the
 
01:50:42.109 --> 01:50:42.119 align:start position:0%
known history of weapons the fact
 
01:50:44.149 --> 01:50:44.159 align:start position:0%
whether the person has been seen with uh
 
01:50:46.550 --> 01:50:46.560 align:start position:0%
with weapons at that point
 
01:50:46.560 --> 01:50:47.209 align:start position:0%
with weapons at that point
um

01:50:47.209 --> 01:50:47.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:50.530 --> 01:50:50.540 align:start position:0%
if uh it falls back on their history
 
01:50:53.030 --> 01:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
both uh
 
01:50:55.010 --> 01:50:55.020 align:start position:0%
you know long-term history as well as
 
01:50:56.450 --> 01:50:56.460 align:start position:0%
their recent history involved in that
 
01:50:58.970 --> 01:50:58.980 align:start position:0%
particular investigation or case so I
 
01:51:00.890 --> 01:51:00.900 align:start position:0%
mean drugs and drugs and guns are what
 
01:51:03.649 --> 01:51:03.659 align:start position:0%
what really pushed the
 
01:51:05.810 --> 01:51:05.820 align:start position:0%
push the the needle so to speak to to
 
01:51:10.189 --> 01:51:10.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:12.050 --> 01:51:12.060 align:start position:0%
has there ever been a case in New
 
01:51:14.209 --> 01:51:14.219 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as far as you're aware of a
 
01:51:18.530 --> 01:51:18.540 align:start position:0%
human trafficking uh case of no knock
 
01:51:21.530 --> 01:51:21.540 align:start position:0%
warranting where they had gone in to uh
 
01:51:23.750 --> 01:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
in regards to human trafficking and or
 
01:51:26.689 --> 01:51:26.699 align:start position:0%
something other than drug or uh violent
 
01:51:29.750 --> 01:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
well we have had human trafficking cases
 
01:51:31.129 --> 01:51:31.139 align:start position:0%
in the city of Manchester that I can
 
01:51:33.050 --> 01:51:33.060 align:start position:0%
speak of firsthand
 
01:51:33.060 --> 01:51:33.709 align:start position:0%
speak of firsthand
um

01:51:33.709 --> 01:51:33.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:37.070 --> 01:51:37.080 align:start position:0%
but while I will say in those cases
 
01:51:39.229 --> 01:51:39.239 align:start position:0%
it wasn't just the human tracking and
 
01:51:41.870 --> 01:51:41.880 align:start position:0%
trafficking involved it was also a drug
 
01:51:44.990 --> 01:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
aspect drug sales as well as uh firearm
 
01:51:47.030 --> 01:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
purchasing uh illegally
 
01:51:49.729 --> 01:51:49.739 align:start position:0%
so it was an intertwined situation it
 
01:51:54.109 --> 01:51:54.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:57.050 --> 01:51:57.060 align:start position:0%
as I recall I believe it was uh multiple
 
01:51:59.090 --> 01:51:59.100 align:start position:0%
addresses multiple people involved in it
 
01:52:01.669 --> 01:52:01.679 align:start position:0%
so it was kind of a a fluid situation
 
01:52:04.310 --> 01:52:04.320 align:start position:0%
but they were no knock yes sir
 
01:52:06.169 --> 01:52:06.179 align:start position:0%
Representative no
 
01:52:08.209 --> 01:52:08.219 align:start position:0%
real quickly I'm just really curious
 
01:52:09.890 --> 01:52:09.900 align:start position:0%
when you're saying here you talk about a
 
01:52:11.629 --> 01:52:11.639 align:start position:0%
PA announcement and I'm wondering you
 
01:52:12.890 --> 01:52:12.900 align:start position:0%
know when we're talking about no knock
 
01:52:15.290 --> 01:52:15.300 align:start position:0%
the the point is it's the element of
 
01:52:16.910 --> 01:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
surprise you know what I mean it's like
 
01:52:18.950 --> 01:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
the element of of not knowing so when
 
01:52:21.169 --> 01:52:21.179 align:start position:0%
does the PA announcement happen
 
01:52:24.050 --> 01:52:24.060 align:start position:0%
the PA announcement occurs right after
 
01:52:25.870 --> 01:52:25.880 align:start position:0%
we we get
 
01:52:28.550 --> 01:52:28.560 align:start position:0%
right after we basically are announcing
 
01:52:31.189 --> 01:52:31.199 align:start position:0%
our presence so first by opening
 
01:52:33.050 --> 01:52:33.060 align:start position:0%
um the door breaching the door of the
 
01:52:35.209 --> 01:52:35.219 align:start position:0%
window whatever it is we're doing and
 
01:52:36.830 --> 01:52:36.840 align:start position:0%
we're following that up with immediate
 
01:52:39.649 --> 01:52:39.659 align:start position:0%
PA announcements and to more better
 
01:52:42.770 --> 01:52:42.780 align:start position:0%
clarify the PA is not like a school PA
 
01:52:44.750 --> 01:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
or something that even just comes from
 
01:52:47.090 --> 01:52:47.100 align:start position:0%
one of our police cruisers it's uh it's
 
01:52:48.350 --> 01:52:48.360 align:start position:0%
actually called an lrad and it's
 
01:52:49.790 --> 01:52:49.800 align:start position:0%
something that's utilized by the
 
01:52:49.800 --> 01:52:50.930 align:start position:0%
something that's utilized by the
military

01:52:50.930 --> 01:52:50.940 align:start position:0%
military
 
01:52:53.450 --> 01:52:53.460 align:start position:0%
um which is like mounted on uh
 
01:52:56.030 --> 01:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
battleships and stuff like that so if
 
01:52:58.609 --> 01:52:58.619 align:start position:0%
utilized we obviously don't use it at a
 
01:53:00.649 --> 01:53:00.659 align:start position:0%
tone at a level that could be heard for
 
01:53:02.810 --> 01:53:02.820 align:start position:0%
miles but it's done in a way so that
 
01:53:04.970 --> 01:53:04.980 align:start position:0%
it's it's very obvious and clear who we
 
01:53:08.209 --> 01:53:08.219 align:start position:0%
are and what we're there for and that
 
01:53:10.129 --> 01:53:10.139 align:start position:0%
has been a progression for us because
 
01:53:11.629 --> 01:53:11.639 align:start position:0%
originally it was just the verbal
 
01:53:13.250 --> 01:53:13.260 align:start position:0%
announcements and it has progressed to
 
01:53:15.290 --> 01:53:15.300 align:start position:0%
the point where it made more sense and
 
01:53:18.590 --> 01:53:18.600 align:start position:0%
it was more safe to go to a more abrupt
 
01:53:20.510 --> 01:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
voice like that and we could get it
 
01:53:22.790 --> 01:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
better from this tool and that's what we
 
01:53:25.310 --> 01:53:25.320 align:start position:0%
have gone to as a team so we have them
 
01:53:25.320 --> 01:53:26.510 align:start position:0%
have gone to as a team so we have them
mounted

01:53:26.510 --> 01:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
mounted
 
01:53:29.930 --> 01:53:29.940 align:start position:0%
um on our vehicles and we also have a
 
01:53:32.090 --> 01:53:32.100 align:start position:0%
couple portable ones as well that we can
 
01:53:34.310 --> 01:53:34.320 align:start position:0%
utilize if it's
 
01:53:37.010 --> 01:53:37.020 align:start position:0%
say a like a apartment structure that
 
01:53:38.629 --> 01:53:38.639 align:start position:0%
has a bigger hallway or something like
 
01:53:41.990 --> 01:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
that or if uh it if it makes sense we
 
01:53:44.270 --> 01:53:44.280 align:start position:0%
have the ability to adjust to it
 
01:53:46.669 --> 01:53:46.679 align:start position:0%
thank you very much sure
 
01:53:49.550 --> 01:53:49.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
01:53:52.729 --> 01:53:52.739 align:start position:0%

01:54:09.290 --> 01:54:09.300 align:start position:0%
good morning I'm Jeff stralzen associate
 
01:54:10.189 --> 01:54:10.199 align:start position:0%
attorney general from New Hampshire
 
01:54:12.350 --> 01:54:12.360 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office I'm here to
 
01:54:14.270 --> 01:54:14.280 align:start position:0%
answer questions any questions that you
 
01:54:15.470 --> 01:54:15.480 align:start position:0%
have about this and also just to point
 
01:54:17.810 --> 01:54:17.820 align:start position:0%
out a couple of issues that we saw with
 
01:54:19.430 --> 01:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
the bill just to bring to your attention
 
01:54:22.370 --> 01:54:22.380 align:start position:0%
to consider maybe the first thing I'll
 
01:54:24.950 --> 01:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
say is that so New Hampshire has what's
 
01:54:27.890 --> 01:54:27.900 align:start position:0%
called a knock and announce rule
 
01:54:29.990 --> 01:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
that rule was recognized in New
 
01:54:31.850 --> 01:54:31.860 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in 1985 by a New Hampshire
 
01:54:35.030 --> 01:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court case and what so it's not
 
01:54:38.689 --> 01:54:38.699 align:start position:0%
by Statute it's not by rule uh the New
 
01:54:40.669 --> 01:54:40.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court recognized it as
 
01:54:42.709 --> 01:54:42.719 align:start position:0%
part of our common law meaning our legal
 
01:54:42.719 --> 01:54:43.790 align:start position:0%
part of our common law meaning our legal
history

01:54:43.790 --> 01:54:43.800 align:start position:0%
history
 
01:54:46.790 --> 01:54:46.800 align:start position:0%
and they recognized exceptions to that
 
01:54:48.890 --> 01:54:48.900 align:start position:0%
rule that are the same exceptions that
 
01:54:51.550 --> 01:54:51.560 align:start position:0%
the U.S Supreme Court has recognized
 
01:54:55.310 --> 01:54:55.320 align:start position:0%
essentially an exception for the
 
01:54:56.870 --> 01:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
preservation of evidence and essentially
 
01:54:59.689 --> 01:54:59.699 align:start position:0%
a life and safety exception and so the
 
01:55:01.189 --> 01:55:01.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Supreme Court rule is
 
01:55:03.709 --> 01:55:03.719 align:start position:0%
consistent with what the U.S Supreme
 
01:55:06.050 --> 01:55:06.060 align:start position:0%
Court has recognized so again as far as
 
01:55:08.090 --> 01:55:08.100 align:start position:0%
I can tell there's no statute no rule in
 
01:55:09.770 --> 01:55:09.780 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire what there is is there's
 
01:55:11.270 --> 01:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
case law from our New Hampshire Supreme
 
01:55:13.790 --> 01:55:13.800 align:start position:0%
Court that said that New Hampshire as a
 
01:55:15.590 --> 01:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
requirement of our common law would
 
01:55:18.470 --> 01:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
require police to knock and announce
 
01:55:21.050 --> 01:55:21.060 align:start position:0%
themselves prior to using Force to make
 
01:55:23.450 --> 01:55:23.460 align:start position:0%
an entry and then recognized that there
 
01:55:25.430 --> 01:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
were exceptions and obviously this bill
 
01:55:27.950 --> 01:55:27.960 align:start position:0%
talks about doing away with all the
 
01:55:30.290 --> 01:55:30.300 align:start position:0%
exceptions so happy to answer more
 
01:55:32.209 --> 01:55:32.219 align:start position:0%
questions about the legal piece of it I
 
01:55:32.990 --> 01:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
just want to tell you about a couple
 
01:55:34.790 --> 01:55:34.800 align:start position:0%
observations that we have with the bill
 
01:55:36.950 --> 01:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
to bring to your attention
 
01:55:39.109 --> 01:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
the first issue is that the bill does
 
01:55:41.330 --> 01:55:41.340 align:start position:0%
not contain an exception for the life
 
01:55:44.450 --> 01:55:44.460 align:start position:0%
and safety piece so that means in
 
01:55:46.790 --> 01:55:46.800 align:start position:0%
certain situations and these are
 
01:55:46.800 --> 01:55:47.709 align:start position:0%
certain situations and these are
typically

01:55:47.709 --> 01:55:47.719 align:start position:0%
typically
 
01:55:50.390 --> 01:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
high-risk situations involving a hostage
 
01:55:53.410 --> 01:55:53.420 align:start position:0%
or a high risk arrestee
 
01:55:55.790 --> 01:55:55.800 align:start position:0%
law enforcement would not be able to get
 
01:55:58.010 --> 01:55:58.020 align:start position:0%
permission to enter without announcing
 
01:55:59.689 --> 01:55:59.699 align:start position:0%
themselves and obviously that would
 
01:56:01.970 --> 01:56:01.980 align:start position:0%
potentially endanger their lives or the
 
01:56:03.709 --> 01:56:03.719 align:start position:0%
people inside if they're trying to
 
01:56:04.729 --> 01:56:04.739 align:start position:0%
rescue somebody if there are other
 
01:56:06.050 --> 01:56:06.060 align:start position:0%
people inside
 
01:56:08.209 --> 01:56:08.219 align:start position:0%
we would suggest that if you're going to
 
01:56:10.129 --> 01:56:10.139 align:start position:0%
consider passing this bill you consider
 
01:56:12.109 --> 01:56:12.119 align:start position:0%
using the same exception that the U.S
 
01:56:14.510 --> 01:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
department of justice has put in place
 
01:56:15.530 --> 01:56:15.540 align:start position:0%
and I think there was a reference
 
01:56:17.750 --> 01:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
earlier about what the what the feds
 
01:56:19.550 --> 01:56:19.560 align:start position:0%
were doing the federal government
 
01:56:22.370 --> 01:56:22.380 align:start position:0%
actually put in place a limitation on no
 
01:56:24.709 --> 01:56:24.719 align:start position:0%
knock warrants essentially what they did
 
01:56:26.629 --> 01:56:26.639 align:start position:0%
is there was an executive order a
 
01:56:28.010 --> 01:56:28.020 align:start position:0%
directive issued by the U.S department
 
01:56:30.890 --> 01:56:30.900 align:start position:0%
of justice that did away with the
 
01:56:33.950 --> 01:56:33.960 align:start position:0%
property exception meaning law
 
01:56:35.750 --> 01:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement could no longer ask for a no
 
01:56:37.370 --> 01:56:37.380 align:start position:0%
knock warrant and say we want to use it
 
01:56:39.890 --> 01:56:39.900 align:start position:0%
to protect the destruction of property
 
01:56:42.050 --> 01:56:42.060 align:start position:0%
the FED said no more of that but they
 
01:56:45.470 --> 01:56:45.480 align:start position:0%
still kept the life safety exception
 
01:56:47.510 --> 01:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
um and believed at the time the Warren
 
01:56:50.330 --> 01:56:50.340 align:start position:0%
is sought knocking and announcing the
 
01:56:51.770 --> 01:56:51.780 align:start position:0%
office's president would create an
 
01:56:54.290 --> 01:56:54.300 align:start position:0%
imminent threat of physical violence to
 
01:56:56.209 --> 01:56:56.219 align:start position:0%
the officer another person they would
 
01:56:58.370 --> 01:56:58.380 align:start position:0%
not they could get the no knock warrant
 
01:57:01.010 --> 01:57:01.020 align:start position:0%
so that's my understanding of what the
 
01:57:03.530 --> 01:57:03.540 align:start position:0%
federal government has done and that and
 
01:57:05.450 --> 01:57:05.460 align:start position:0%
that was talked about was an expansion
 
01:57:07.250 --> 01:57:07.260 align:start position:0%
to other fed federal agencies originally
 
01:57:08.629 --> 01:57:08.639 align:start position:0%
it was issued to the U.S Department of
 
01:57:11.270 --> 01:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
Justice I think to the FBI now my
 
01:57:12.830 --> 01:57:12.840 align:start position:0%
understanding is it's going to be it's
 
01:57:14.209 --> 01:57:14.219 align:start position:0%
going to be implemented across the board
 
01:57:16.550 --> 01:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
to other federal agencies but again my
 
01:57:17.930 --> 01:57:17.940 align:start position:0%
understanding is that what the feds have
 
01:57:20.270 --> 01:57:20.280 align:start position:0%
done is kept the life safety exemption
 
01:57:22.189 --> 01:57:22.199 align:start position:0%
for no knock warrants but they have
 
01:57:24.830 --> 01:57:24.840 align:start position:0%
eliminated the one for uh preserving
 
01:57:26.990 --> 01:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
property so we would suggest that if
 
01:57:27.890 --> 01:57:27.900 align:start position:0%
you're going to consider this building
 
01:57:29.990 --> 01:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
you consider keeping that life safety
 
01:57:33.229 --> 01:57:33.239 align:start position:0%
exemption in place because again I will
 
01:57:34.370 --> 01:57:34.380 align:start position:0%
tell you in my experience as a
 
01:57:35.750 --> 01:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
prosecutor there have certainly been
 
01:57:37.609 --> 01:57:37.619 align:start position:0%
times where we have discussions with
 
01:57:39.410 --> 01:57:39.420 align:start position:0%
with the police that we're working with
 
01:57:41.750 --> 01:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
about making an arrest and about whether
 
01:57:43.310 --> 01:57:43.320 align:start position:0%
or not and you heard that you heard the
 
01:57:45.649 --> 01:57:45.659 align:start position:0%
term threat Matrix there's a series of
 
01:57:47.810 --> 01:57:47.820 align:start position:0%
factors that the police use to determine
 
01:57:49.609 --> 01:57:49.619 align:start position:0%
whether or not SWAT is appropriate
 
01:57:51.589 --> 01:57:51.599 align:start position:0%
looking at different factors like the
 
01:57:53.990 --> 01:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
type of crime the history of the
 
01:57:56.209 --> 01:57:56.219 align:start position:0%
arrestee things like that to determine
 
01:57:58.310 --> 01:57:58.320 align:start position:0%
whether or not it's appropriate to use a
 
01:58:00.530 --> 01:58:00.540 align:start position:0%
high risk entry or SWAT entry and it
 
01:58:02.089 --> 01:58:02.099 align:start position:0%
would seem to make sense based on my
 
01:58:04.490 --> 01:58:04.500 align:start position:0%
experience to keep that exception in
 
01:58:07.010 --> 01:58:07.020 align:start position:0%
some limited circumstance so they'd have
 
01:58:09.229 --> 01:58:09.239 align:start position:0%
that ability one of the other things
 
01:58:11.270 --> 01:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
that was mentioned was about
 
01:58:13.490 --> 01:58:13.500 align:start position:0%
the issue of you know why do you need to
 
01:58:15.589 --> 01:58:15.599 align:start position:0%
go into someone's home and
 
01:58:17.689 --> 01:58:17.699 align:start position:0%
you know I get involved with tactics
 
01:58:21.229 --> 01:58:21.239 align:start position:0%
only because as a prosecutor we we are
 
01:58:23.450 --> 01:58:23.460 align:start position:0%
part of the decision on our cases about
 
01:58:26.209 --> 01:58:26.219 align:start position:0%
arrests I do not profess to be an expert
 
01:58:27.890 --> 01:58:27.900 align:start position:0%
in tactics however I will tell you what
 
01:58:29.209 --> 01:58:29.219 align:start position:0%
I what I've learned from Law Enforcement
 
01:58:31.310 --> 01:58:31.320 align:start position:0%
Officers because early on I would say
 
01:58:31.320 --> 01:58:32.330 align:start position:0%
Officers because early on I would say
well

01:58:32.330 --> 01:58:32.340 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:58:34.129 --> 01:58:34.139 align:start position:0%
why can't you just arrest that person
 
01:58:36.530 --> 01:58:36.540 align:start position:0%
when they're over here or over here at
 
01:58:39.290 --> 01:58:39.300 align:start position:0%
work or out in public and the answer is
 
01:58:40.970 --> 01:58:40.980 align:start position:0%
it's much more difficult for the police
 
01:58:43.430 --> 01:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
to control that situation out in public
 
01:58:46.010 --> 01:58:46.020 align:start position:0%
if God forbid shots start getting fired
 
01:58:48.950 --> 01:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
many many more people are at risk and so
 
01:58:51.890 --> 01:58:51.900 align:start position:0%
often trying to get that person can you
 
01:58:53.450 --> 01:58:53.460 align:start position:0%
know arrest that person in a contained
 
01:58:56.629 --> 01:58:56.639 align:start position:0%
space is the most safest way to do it so
 
01:58:57.890 --> 01:58:57.900 align:start position:0%
again I'll let them speak to that
 
01:58:59.450 --> 01:58:59.460 align:start position:0%
tactical piece but I will tell you I've
 
01:59:01.609 --> 01:59:01.619 align:start position:0%
been involved in listening to that
 
01:59:04.010 --> 01:59:04.020 align:start position:0%
decision-making process about why it is
 
01:59:05.810 --> 01:59:05.820 align:start position:0%
you would arrest somebody in a certain
 
01:59:05.820 --> 01:59:07.209 align:start position:0%
you would arrest somebody in a certain
place

01:59:07.209 --> 01:59:07.219 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:59:10.070 --> 01:59:10.080 align:start position:0%
and just so it's clear about how the
 
01:59:12.470 --> 01:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
legal process works
 
01:59:14.390 --> 01:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
this would affect arrest I think
 
01:59:15.410 --> 01:59:15.420 align:start position:0%
somebody asked a question would this
 
01:59:17.209 --> 01:59:17.219 align:start position:0%
affect arrest warrants and the answer is
 
01:59:19.490 --> 01:59:19.500 align:start position:0%
it would and let me explain why
 
01:59:21.189 --> 01:59:21.199 align:start position:0%
the way the law Works in New Hampshire
 
01:59:24.770 --> 01:59:24.780 align:start position:0%
if I get an arrest warrant from my
 
01:59:27.530 --> 01:59:27.540 align:start position:0%
neighbor the the arrest warrant allows
 
01:59:30.290 --> 01:59:30.300 align:start position:0%
me to enter into that person's home to
 
01:59:32.149 --> 01:59:32.159 align:start position:0%
make the arrest without an additional
 
01:59:33.470 --> 01:59:33.480 align:start position:0%
search warrant
 
01:59:36.109 --> 01:59:36.119 align:start position:0%
but if I want to arrest that person in
 
01:59:38.450 --> 01:59:38.460 align:start position:0%
their neighbor's home or at work or in
 
01:59:41.689 --> 01:59:41.699 align:start position:0%
some other location you must secure a
 
01:59:43.790 --> 01:59:43.800 align:start position:0%
search warrant to go in and execute that
 
01:59:46.910 --> 01:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
arrest so that's why arrest warrants
 
01:59:48.830 --> 01:59:48.840 align:start position:0%
could very well be implicated in a lot
 
01:59:50.270 --> 01:59:50.280 align:start position:0%
of these cases if you have to go
 
01:59:52.250 --> 01:59:52.260 align:start position:0%
somewhere else I have to make an entry
 
01:59:53.930 --> 01:59:53.940 align:start position:0%
that is not the person's home even if
 
01:59:56.209 --> 01:59:56.219 align:start position:0%
it's just for an arrest so the two are
 
01:59:58.790 --> 01:59:58.800 align:start position:0%
linked together in New Hampshire by that
 
02:00:00.830 --> 02:00:00.840 align:start position:0%
requirement and loss so one would impact
 
02:00:02.570 --> 02:00:02.580 align:start position:0%
the other
 
02:00:06.470 --> 02:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
um another issue with the bill is
 
02:00:08.030 --> 02:00:08.040 align:start position:0%
just the wording of the bill and this
 
02:00:09.709 --> 02:00:09.719 align:start position:0%
may have been an unintended consequence
 
02:00:13.550 --> 02:00:13.560 align:start position:0%
but in paragraph 2A the bill says that
 
02:00:15.770 --> 02:00:15.780 align:start position:0%
an officer cannot forcibly enter a
 
02:00:18.950 --> 02:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
building until the person inside refuses
 
02:00:18.960 --> 02:00:20.990 align:start position:0%
building until the person inside refuses
admittance

02:00:20.990 --> 02:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
admittance
 
02:00:23.450 --> 02:00:23.460 align:start position:0%
so that means if the person inside says
 
02:00:26.510 --> 02:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
nothing the officer can never enter
 
02:00:28.609 --> 02:00:28.619 align:start position:0%
or if the building is empty and nobody
 
02:00:30.410 --> 02:00:30.420 align:start position:0%
refuses abundance the officer could
 
02:00:32.390 --> 02:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
never enter so we think that was
 
02:00:36.290 --> 02:00:36.300 align:start position:0%
probably an unintended consequence and
 
02:00:37.910 --> 02:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
should probably strike that language
 
02:00:40.609 --> 02:00:40.619 align:start position:0%
because otherwise if an officer knocks
 
02:00:42.950 --> 02:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
and announces himself or herself the
 
02:00:44.930 --> 02:00:44.940 align:start position:0%
person inside under this bill simply
 
02:00:47.030 --> 02:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
remains silent and the officer can never
 
02:00:49.490 --> 02:00:49.500 align:start position:0%
enter to execute the warrant or if the
 
02:00:51.470 --> 02:00:51.480 align:start position:0%
building is empty could never
 
02:00:53.209 --> 02:00:53.219 align:start position:0%
enter the enter the building execute the
 
02:00:54.530 --> 02:00:54.540 align:start position:0%
warrant again I think that's probably an
 
02:00:56.149 --> 02:00:56.159 align:start position:0%
unintended consequence but I would just
 
02:00:57.770 --> 02:00:57.780 align:start position:0%
point that out that that's a little bit
 
02:01:00.350 --> 02:01:00.360 align:start position:0%
of a quirk in that in that language in
 
02:01:01.250 --> 02:01:01.260 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
02:01:03.830 --> 02:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
so those are the two issues we see one
 
02:01:07.010 --> 02:01:07.020 align:start position:0%
is that usdoj has CR has carved out a
 
02:01:09.169 --> 02:01:09.179 align:start position:0%
life safety exception we would ask you
 
02:01:11.810 --> 02:01:11.820 align:start position:0%
to consider that as well and second just
 
02:01:13.370 --> 02:01:13.380 align:start position:0%
that language in the bill I think
 
02:01:15.649 --> 02:01:15.659 align:start position:0%
creates an unintended consequence and
 
02:01:17.149 --> 02:01:17.159 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any questions about
 
02:01:19.129 --> 02:01:19.139 align:start position:0%
the comments that we have on the bill or
 
02:01:21.290 --> 02:01:21.300 align:start position:0%
the law or or the process of how this
 
02:01:23.330 --> 02:01:23.340 align:start position:0%
works to the extent I can
 
02:01:26.089 --> 02:01:26.099 align:start position:0%
thank you for that testimony Could you
 
02:01:28.129 --> 02:01:28.139 align:start position:0%
um and I tried to get at it early I
 
02:01:31.070 --> 02:01:31.080 align:start position:0%
don't think I got it is there any
 
02:01:32.810 --> 02:01:32.820 align:start position:0%
different process to get a no knock
 
02:01:34.490 --> 02:01:34.500 align:start position:0%
warrant when you're applying to the
 
02:01:36.530 --> 02:01:36.540 align:start position:0%
court versus a regular warrant do you
 
02:01:38.089 --> 02:01:38.099 align:start position:0%
have to tell the court you're seeking a
 
02:01:40.010 --> 02:01:40.020 align:start position:0%
no knock warrant or Can the police
 
02:01:41.510 --> 02:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
officer just decide you know what we're
 
02:01:43.010 --> 02:01:43.020 align:start position:0%
going to do this no knock
 
02:01:45.410 --> 02:01:45.420 align:start position:0%
so let me just start with saying these
 
02:01:47.030 --> 02:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
are I've been a prosecutor a little over
 
02:01:50.570 --> 02:01:50.580 align:start position:0%
26 years I have I can't specifically
 
02:01:51.890 --> 02:01:51.900 align:start position:0%
tell you about a case where I've had
 
02:01:53.149 --> 02:01:53.159 align:start position:0%
these but I know I've had them that's
 
02:01:55.550 --> 02:01:55.560 align:start position:0%
how rare they are my understanding is
 
02:01:58.129 --> 02:01:58.139 align:start position:0%
that you obtain a no-knock warrant by
 
02:02:00.050 --> 02:02:00.060 align:start position:0%
establishing probable cause for it just
 
02:02:01.189 --> 02:02:01.199 align:start position:0%
like when you go in for your search
 
02:02:02.629 --> 02:02:02.639 align:start position:0%
warrant that it's part of that process
 
02:02:04.729 --> 02:02:04.739 align:start position:0%
because in New Hampshire our Supreme
 
02:02:07.729 --> 02:02:07.739 align:start position:0%
Court has said we have a rule and the
 
02:02:10.070 --> 02:02:10.080 align:start position:0%
rule says you police officer must not
 
02:02:12.169 --> 02:02:12.179 align:start position:0%
get an announce so the way I read that
 
02:02:13.970 --> 02:02:13.980 align:start position:0%
the way I've interpreted it and the way
 
02:02:16.250 --> 02:02:16.260 align:start position:0%
I advise police about these types of
 
02:02:18.830 --> 02:02:18.840 align:start position:0%
things is you have to lay that out in
 
02:02:20.510 --> 02:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
your application for the search warrant
 
02:02:23.330 --> 02:02:23.340 align:start position:0%
and establish the probable cause to be
 
02:02:24.709 --> 02:02:24.719 align:start position:0%
able to do that
 
02:02:28.370 --> 02:02:28.380 align:start position:0%
so that should be the process again
 
02:02:30.470 --> 02:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
these are so these are so incredibly
 
02:02:32.270 --> 02:02:32.280 align:start position:0%
rare I could not come up with a written
 
02:02:37.370 --> 02:02:37.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:39.109 --> 02:02:39.119 align:start position:0%
give you a testimony you're welcome
 
02:02:42.709 --> 02:02:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:44.930 --> 02:02:44.940 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes major Joseph Ebert
 
02:02:52.790 --> 02:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:54.470 --> 02:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone my name is Joe
 
02:02:57.290 --> 02:02:57.300 align:start position:0%
Ebert it's ebirt I'm a major with the
 
02:02:58.370 --> 02:02:58.380 align:start position:0%
state police overseeing the
 
02:03:01.490 --> 02:03:01.500 align:start position:0%
Investigative Services Bureau and I
 
02:03:03.109 --> 02:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
purposely chose to go behind attorney
 
02:03:04.970 --> 02:03:04.980 align:start position:0%
schroelsen today because I knew he was
 
02:03:06.649 --> 02:03:06.659 align:start position:0%
going to raise many of the the same
 
02:03:09.109 --> 02:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
issues that I was going to so I'll keep
 
02:03:10.970 --> 02:03:10.980 align:start position:0%
my testimony very brief because I think
 
02:03:13.430 --> 02:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
he touched on the things that were of
 
02:03:16.430 --> 02:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
greatest concern to the state police
 
02:03:19.070 --> 02:03:19.080 align:start position:0%
specifically the uh the language in the
 
02:03:21.350 --> 02:03:21.360 align:start position:0%
bill that doesn't address whether or not
 
02:03:23.870 --> 02:03:23.880 align:start position:0%
when somebody doesn't respond from
 
02:03:25.070 --> 02:03:25.080 align:start position:0%
inside the building or when somebody
 
02:03:26.589 --> 02:03:26.599 align:start position:0%
isn't in the building
 
02:03:29.169 --> 02:03:29.179 align:start position:0%
one thing I did want to say
 
02:03:31.609 --> 02:03:31.619 align:start position:0%
generally is that
 
02:03:34.430 --> 02:03:34.440 align:start position:0%
as the officers from Manchester Police
 
02:03:36.169 --> 02:03:36.179 align:start position:0%
Department have said and I think
 
02:03:39.770 --> 02:03:39.780 align:start position:0%
everybody who is involved with these
 
02:03:41.270 --> 02:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
this type of Warrant
 
02:03:44.750 --> 02:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
it is incredibly important to consider
 
02:03:47.030 --> 02:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
life and safety and that is something we
 
02:03:49.669 --> 02:03:49.679 align:start position:0%
absolutely do on a regular basis before
 
02:03:51.950 --> 02:03:51.960 align:start position:0%
any warrant is executed
 
02:03:55.370 --> 02:03:55.380 align:start position:0%
having said that I would request much
 
02:03:56.810 --> 02:03:56.820 align:start position:0%
like the Attorney General's office did
 
02:03:59.450 --> 02:03:59.460 align:start position:0%
that if you are so inclined to pass a
 
02:04:01.250 --> 02:04:01.260 align:start position:0%
version of this bill that provides
 
02:04:03.169 --> 02:04:03.179 align:start position:0%
bumpers for law enforcement to stay
 
02:04:03.179 --> 02:04:04.070 align:start position:0%
bumpers for law enforcement to stay
Within

02:04:04.070 --> 02:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
Within
 
02:04:06.589 --> 02:04:06.599 align:start position:0%
that you do not eliminate the
 
02:04:09.350 --> 02:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
possibility of the use of this uh this
 
02:04:11.990 --> 02:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
action so what that may look like
 
02:04:14.570 --> 02:04:14.580 align:start position:0%
whether it is life and safety or it is
 
02:04:17.870 --> 02:04:17.880 align:start position:0%
some other metric that you approve of I
 
02:04:20.510 --> 02:04:20.520 align:start position:0%
would just ask that you consider the
 
02:04:22.790 --> 02:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
situations that we've run into where we
 
02:04:25.450 --> 02:04:25.460 align:start position:0%
are executing these Dynamic warrants
 
02:04:28.250 --> 02:04:28.260 align:start position:0%
the factories involved in them vary so
 
02:04:29.990 --> 02:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
much that I couldn't possibly tell you
 
02:04:31.850 --> 02:04:31.860 align:start position:0%
all the things we may or may not run
 
02:04:33.169 --> 02:04:33.179 align:start position:0%
into in the future
 
02:04:36.350 --> 02:04:36.360 align:start position:0%
but I do know that I if you're inclined
 
02:04:38.810 --> 02:04:38.820 align:start position:0%
to put those bumpers in line I would
 
02:04:41.390 --> 02:04:41.400 align:start position:0%
just ask that you give us some variance
 
02:04:44.149 --> 02:04:44.159 align:start position:0%
to be able to utilize this in specific
 
02:04:47.330 --> 02:04:47.340 align:start position:0%
situations so having said that I'm more
 
02:04:48.770 --> 02:04:48.780 align:start position:0%
than happy to answer any questions you
 
02:04:50.390 --> 02:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
might have
 
02:04:52.310 --> 02:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony do you have
 
02:04:55.310 --> 02:04:55.320 align:start position:0%
any specific or even anecdotal evidence
 
02:04:57.589 --> 02:04:57.599 align:start position:0%
about how many of these cases the state
 
02:04:59.930 --> 02:04:59.940 align:start position:0%
police might engage in a year
 
02:05:02.629 --> 02:05:02.639 align:start position:0%
I can give you anecdotal evidence I I'm
 
02:05:05.209 --> 02:05:05.219 align:start position:0%
happy to talk to the uh our tactical
 
02:05:07.070 --> 02:05:07.080 align:start position:0%
team leader to give you actual uh
 
02:05:08.990 --> 02:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
numbers but uh much like attorney
 
02:05:11.570 --> 02:05:11.580 align:start position:0%
straussen said these are very rare
 
02:05:14.089 --> 02:05:14.099 align:start position:0%
they're very few and far between
 
02:05:17.030 --> 02:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
um and I don't recall the last time we
 
02:05:19.370 --> 02:05:19.380 align:start position:0%
executed a no knock warrant having said
 
02:05:21.950 --> 02:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
that though again that's not my area of
 
02:05:25.189 --> 02:05:25.199 align:start position:0%
expertise uh so I'm happy to uh provide
 
02:05:27.830 --> 02:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
the committee via email with the number
 
02:05:29.870 --> 02:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
that we do approximately in the course
 
02:05:31.910 --> 02:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
of a year the committee would appreciate
 
02:05:33.770 --> 02:05:33.780 align:start position:0%
that if you could and it's readily
 
02:05:35.510 --> 02:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
available go back a couple years just so
 
02:05:37.310 --> 02:05:37.320 align:start position:0%
we can see a trend or a pattern in it
 
02:05:40.310 --> 02:05:40.320 align:start position:0%
certainly representative Newman
 
02:05:43.430 --> 02:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
thank you I'd like to follow up on the
 
02:05:45.530 --> 02:05:45.540 align:start position:0%
Chairman's question about the no knock
 
02:05:45.540 --> 02:05:46.550 align:start position:0%
Chairman's question about the no knock
warrant

02:05:46.550 --> 02:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
warrant
 
02:05:49.250 --> 02:05:49.260 align:start position:0%
when the state police apply for a search
 
02:05:49.260 --> 02:05:50.450 align:start position:0%
when the state police apply for a search
warrant

02:05:50.450 --> 02:05:50.460 align:start position:0%
warrant
 
02:05:52.729 --> 02:05:52.739 align:start position:0%
and their intention is to use a no knock
 
02:05:52.739 --> 02:05:53.870 align:start position:0%
and their intention is to use a no knock
warrant

02:05:53.870 --> 02:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
warrant
 
02:05:55.970 --> 02:05:55.980 align:start position:0%
is there a rule that's written as
 
02:05:57.649 --> 02:05:57.659 align:start position:0%
something other than common law that
 
02:05:59.209 --> 02:05:59.219 align:start position:0%
hasn't been noticed by the Supreme Court
 
02:06:02.089 --> 02:06:02.099 align:start position:0%
do they specifically have to if they are
 
02:06:03.950 --> 02:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
going to use the no knock warrants
 
02:06:06.950 --> 02:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
indicate in the search warrant request
 
02:06:09.709 --> 02:06:09.719 align:start position:0%
that that is their intention
 
02:06:11.330 --> 02:06:11.340 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh
 
02:06:13.189 --> 02:06:13.199 align:start position:0%
representative Newman I
 
02:06:16.370 --> 02:06:16.380 align:start position:0%
be very uh transparent with you and
 
02:06:18.050 --> 02:06:18.060 align:start position:0%
saying that I don't know the definitive
 
02:06:20.209 --> 02:06:20.219 align:start position:0%
answer to that question but I'm happy to
 
02:06:21.770 --> 02:06:21.780 align:start position:0%
provide it in the email that I sent to
 
02:06:24.649 --> 02:06:24.659 align:start position:0%
the chairman so I don't want to speak my
 
02:06:26.930 --> 02:06:26.940 align:start position:0%
understanding is that yes we make uh
 
02:06:28.970 --> 02:06:28.980 align:start position:0%
clear Our intention to utilize a no
 
02:06:32.810 --> 02:06:32.820 align:start position:0%
knock tactic but having said that what I
 
02:06:34.430 --> 02:06:34.440 align:start position:0%
will do is I will ask our Tactical Team
 
02:06:36.350 --> 02:06:36.360 align:start position:0%
commander and I will provide the
 
02:06:38.629 --> 02:06:38.639 align:start position:0%
committee with a definitive answer
 
02:06:41.270 --> 02:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up
 
02:06:43.790 --> 02:06:43.800 align:start position:0%
when you find that wherever it is along
 
02:06:45.589 --> 02:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
with the information about what it is
 
02:06:50.270 --> 02:06:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:55.729 --> 02:06:55.739 align:start position:0%
I I mean if yes when you return that I
 
02:06:57.890 --> 02:06:57.900 align:start position:0%
mean there are protocols and stuff for
 
02:06:59.870 --> 02:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
various places and I I'm just curious
 
02:07:01.669 --> 02:07:01.679 align:start position:0%
where could we look that up if that's
 
02:07:03.229 --> 02:07:03.239 align:start position:0%
available to the public
 
02:07:06.109 --> 02:07:06.119 align:start position:0%
absolutely yeah so I would have to look
 
02:07:08.209 --> 02:07:08.219 align:start position:0%
into uh I believe our policies and
 
02:07:11.229 --> 02:07:11.239 align:start position:0%
procedures are all accessible via 91a
 
02:07:13.910 --> 02:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
and their policies and procedures that
 
02:07:16.430 --> 02:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
govern our Tactical Team and the
 
02:07:18.950 --> 02:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
execution of search warrants uh within
 
02:07:21.410 --> 02:07:21.420 align:start position:0%
them so I'm happy to provide the
 
02:07:23.990 --> 02:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
information on where that is thank you
 
02:07:25.970 --> 02:07:25.980 align:start position:0%
if it wouldn't be too much trouble and
 
02:07:27.589 --> 02:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
you could get one could you get us a
 
02:07:28.910 --> 02:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
copy of search warrant application
 
02:07:32.149 --> 02:07:32.159 align:start position:0%
standard application absolutely and just
 
02:07:34.129 --> 02:07:34.139 align:start position:0%
work to see if we can discern for
 
02:07:35.450 --> 02:07:35.460 align:start position:0%
ourselves if there's a spot on there
 
02:07:37.609 --> 02:07:37.619 align:start position:0%
they check no knock
 
02:07:39.830 --> 02:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
um representative Reed
 
02:07:48.589 --> 02:07:48.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:51.169 --> 02:07:51.179 align:start position:0%
if I understand you it's not that common
 
02:07:53.750 --> 02:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
of An Occurrence correct
 
02:07:56.149 --> 02:07:56.159 align:start position:0%
that is uh so I appreciate the question
 
02:07:58.310 --> 02:07:58.320 align:start position:0%
uh but I I think there may be a
 
02:07:59.750 --> 02:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
separation of two separate things there
 
02:08:02.510 --> 02:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
so whether they happen regularly in
 
02:08:03.830 --> 02:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
other jurisdictions throughout the
 
02:08:05.390 --> 02:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
course of the United States that I can't
 
02:08:08.030 --> 02:08:08.040 align:start position:0%
speak to uh what I can say is that uh
 
02:08:10.970 --> 02:08:10.980 align:start position:0%
having been had some involvement as a
 
02:08:12.950 --> 02:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
crisis negotiator with our Tactical Team
 
02:08:15.709 --> 02:08:15.719 align:start position:0%
uh for many years
 
02:08:20.149 --> 02:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
I am not aware of a slew of no knock
 
02:08:22.790 --> 02:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
warrants On Any Given uh On Any Given
 
02:08:25.970 --> 02:08:25.980 align:start position:0%
year and I think I would again
 
02:08:27.890 --> 02:08:27.900 align:start position:0%
anecdotally I would offer to the
 
02:08:30.890 --> 02:08:30.900 align:start position:0%
committee that I as time has progressed
 
02:08:33.410 --> 02:08:33.420 align:start position:0%
we our tactical team has moved away from
 
02:08:35.810 --> 02:08:35.820 align:start position:0%
uh no knock warrants throughout the
 
02:08:38.510 --> 02:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
course of my involvement although
 
02:08:40.490 --> 02:08:40.500 align:start position:0%
limited with that team
 
02:08:40.500 --> 02:08:42.169 align:start position:0%
limited with that team
foreign

scitec
 
02:08:46.970 --> 02:08:46.980 align:start position:0%
could you give us a flavor for what in
 
02:08:49.430 --> 02:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
your interaction with the judges you're
 
02:08:50.990 --> 02:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
applying you're standing before the
 
02:08:52.970 --> 02:08:52.980 align:start position:0%
judge can you give us a sense of feel
 
02:08:56.689 --> 02:08:56.699 align:start position:0%
how that conversation goes
 
02:08:59.330 --> 02:08:59.340 align:start position:0%
I can I I've been before many judges to
 
02:09:00.950 --> 02:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
discuss search warrants
 
02:09:04.669 --> 02:09:04.679 align:start position:0%
um and oftentimes uh the judges when we
 
02:09:07.010 --> 02:09:07.020 align:start position:0%
discuss whether or not this is going to
 
02:09:10.609 --> 02:09:10.619 align:start position:0%
be executed uh at uh early morning hours
 
02:09:13.189 --> 02:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
or if there is a going to be a request
 
02:09:16.189 --> 02:09:16.199 align:start position:0%
for a no knock uh oftentimes the judges
 
02:09:20.270 --> 02:09:20.280 align:start position:0%
are hesitant to opine on what should be
 
02:09:22.250 --> 02:09:22.260 align:start position:0%
done it's been my experience that what
 
02:09:24.830 --> 02:09:24.840 align:start position:0%
they will say is well you discussed with
 
02:09:27.350 --> 02:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
me the tactics that are needed uh you
 
02:09:28.609 --> 02:09:28.619 align:start position:0%
know I will tell you whether or not you
 
02:09:31.790 --> 02:09:31.800 align:start position:0%
have probable cause but the safety of
 
02:09:33.589 --> 02:09:33.599 align:start position:0%
how this warrant is executed is really
 
02:09:35.689 --> 02:09:35.699 align:start position:0%
something that should rely on uh should
 
02:09:37.970 --> 02:09:37.980 align:start position:0%
rest with the law enforcement but
 
02:09:39.589 --> 02:09:39.599 align:start position:0%
oftentimes there's a discussion that
 
02:09:42.109 --> 02:09:42.119 align:start position:0%
takes place with that judge saying hey
 
02:09:44.089 --> 02:09:44.099 align:start position:0%
this is the dangerous he's read the
 
02:09:46.550 --> 02:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
affidavit so he knows or she knows
 
02:09:50.030 --> 02:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
exactly what the case specifics are and
 
02:09:51.649 --> 02:09:51.659 align:start position:0%
they will often engage us in a
 
02:09:53.209 --> 02:09:53.219 align:start position:0%
conversation about well what is the
 
02:09:57.370 --> 02:09:57.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:01.010 --> 02:10:01.020 align:start position:0%
and if I could during that process is it
 
02:10:03.169 --> 02:10:03.179 align:start position:0%
is it normal for the judge to to push
 
02:10:04.910 --> 02:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
back occasionally and say you need a
 
02:10:06.350 --> 02:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
little more probable cause here this
 
02:10:10.070 --> 02:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:13.310 --> 02:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
which are are they routinely granted
 
02:10:15.589 --> 02:10:15.599 align:start position:0%
without question or do they do they get
 
02:10:17.390 --> 02:10:17.400 align:start position:0%
into the affidavits and say wait a
 
02:10:18.410 --> 02:10:18.420 align:start position:0%
minute you know
 
02:10:20.689 --> 02:10:20.699 align:start position:0%
I appreciate the question thank you uh I
 
02:10:23.990 --> 02:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
would say that judges are uh it has been
 
02:10:26.629 --> 02:10:26.639 align:start position:0%
my experience that when we ask for a
 
02:10:29.149 --> 02:10:29.159 align:start position:0%
search warrant or an affidavit uh the
 
02:10:30.709 --> 02:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
judge spends a significant period of
 
02:10:32.750 --> 02:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
time reviewing that and they often will
 
02:10:36.589 --> 02:10:36.599 align:start position:0%
have questions uh the latter half of my
 
02:10:38.930 --> 02:10:38.940 align:start position:0%
career in fact most of my career has
 
02:10:40.970 --> 02:10:40.980 align:start position:0%
been spent associated with a major crime
 
02:10:42.830 --> 02:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
unit which is homicides and other major
 
02:10:45.050 --> 02:10:45.060 align:start position:0%
cases and I will tell you that when we
 
02:10:47.450 --> 02:10:47.460 align:start position:0%
go before a judge and we are seeking a
 
02:10:50.810 --> 02:10:50.820 align:start position:0%
warrant in a homicide a kidnapping any
 
02:10:53.209 --> 02:10:53.219 align:start position:0%
any major case a shooting a non-fatal
 
02:10:55.310 --> 02:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
shooting the judges spend an incredible
 
02:10:57.470 --> 02:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
amount of time in fact we're often left
 
02:11:00.109 --> 02:11:00.119 align:start position:0%
uh waiting for that judge uh to return
 
02:11:02.270 --> 02:11:02.280 align:start position:0%
the the warrant and affidavit because
 
02:11:04.189 --> 02:11:04.199 align:start position:0%
they are spending such a long period of
 
02:11:05.629 --> 02:11:05.639 align:start position:0%
time we're left wondering if they had
 
02:11:09.229 --> 02:11:09.239 align:start position:0%
gone back to sleep or uh but I I it's an
 
02:11:11.629 --> 02:11:11.639 align:start position:0%
anecdotal way of me saying I know that
 
02:11:13.370 --> 02:11:13.380 align:start position:0%
they're spending time reading every
 
02:11:15.290 --> 02:11:15.300 align:start position:0%
portion of that and they will often have
 
02:11:17.990 --> 02:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
questions about certain facts that are
 
02:11:21.830 --> 02:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:23.689 --> 02:11:23.699 align:start position:0%
I've seen over the questions thank you
 
02:11:25.370 --> 02:11:25.380 align:start position:0%
for your testimony I appreciate it thank
 
02:11:26.990 --> 02:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
you and thank you for getting back to me
 
02:11:28.729 --> 02:11:28.739 align:start position:0%
with that information
 
02:11:35.810 --> 02:11:35.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:37.609 --> 02:11:37.619 align:start position:0%
sure you filled out a pink card the
 
02:11:38.990 --> 02:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
first time right
 
02:11:53.930 --> 02:11:53.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:55.430 --> 02:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for letting me speak my name
 
02:11:56.810 --> 02:11:56.820 align:start position:0%
is officer linstead of the Manchester
 
02:11:59.089 --> 02:11:59.099 align:start position:0%
Police Department I am the President of
 
02:12:00.589 --> 02:12:00.599 align:start position:0%
the Nash uh New Hampshire tactical
 
02:12:03.350 --> 02:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
offices Association and as I've been
 
02:12:04.490 --> 02:12:04.500 align:start position:0%
sitting here today I've heard some
 
02:12:07.189 --> 02:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
things that I just wanted to address uh
 
02:12:09.770 --> 02:12:09.780 align:start position:0%
if that works for you folks
 
02:12:12.050 --> 02:12:12.060 align:start position:0%
um this has been touched on but I just
 
02:12:13.970 --> 02:12:13.980 align:start position:0%
want to touch on it again a couple of
 
02:12:15.229 --> 02:12:15.239 align:start position:0%
people had mentioned that it's it's
 
02:12:16.910 --> 02:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
easier if David koresh would have walked
 
02:12:16.920 --> 02:12:17.810 align:start position:0%
easier if David koresh would have walked
out

02:12:17.810 --> 02:12:17.820 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:12:20.089 --> 02:12:20.099 align:start position:0%
um and then just place them into custody
 
02:12:22.010 --> 02:12:22.020 align:start position:0%
I understand that the thought process of
 
02:12:25.010 --> 02:12:25.020 align:start position:0%
that but we take every single um
 
02:12:27.169 --> 02:12:27.179 align:start position:0%
situation into consideration before we
 
02:12:29.390 --> 02:12:29.400 align:start position:0%
do these search warrants and there are
 
02:12:29.400 --> 02:12:30.649 align:start position:0%
do these search warrants and there are
times

02:12:30.649 --> 02:12:30.659 align:start position:0%
times
 
02:12:32.450 --> 02:12:32.460 align:start position:0%
a significant amount of times a higher
 
02:12:33.770 --> 02:12:33.780 align:start position:0%
percentage of times where it's more
 
02:12:36.229 --> 02:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
dangerous for the citizens of either
 
02:12:37.669 --> 02:12:37.679 align:start position:0%
Manchester or the state of New Hampshire
 
02:12:39.830 --> 02:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
to let these people that have reached a
 
02:12:41.390 --> 02:12:41.400 align:start position:0%
very high level on the threat assessment
 
02:12:44.089 --> 02:12:44.099 align:start position:0%
to try to take them into custody in the
 
02:12:45.589 --> 02:12:45.599 align:start position:0%
middle of Market Basket or in the middle
 
02:12:47.510 --> 02:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
of Elm Street or Main Street
 
02:12:49.069 --> 02:12:49.079 align:start position:0%
every scenario was taken into
 
02:12:51.350 --> 02:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
consideration and then we decide how we
 
02:12:51.360 --> 02:12:52.089 align:start position:0%
consideration and then we decide how we
do

02:12:52.089 --> 02:12:52.099 align:start position:0%
do
 
02:12:54.950 --> 02:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
take that person into custody
 
02:12:58.370 --> 02:12:58.380 align:start position:0%
each raid if you will or each arrest
 
02:13:02.390 --> 02:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
wanted a search warrant is prepared by
 
02:13:05.270 --> 02:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
multiple officers so an officer or SWAT
 
02:13:07.310 --> 02:13:07.320 align:start position:0%
team member will prepare that and it'll
 
02:13:09.050 --> 02:13:09.060 align:start position:0%
go with a super they'll do that with a
 
02:13:11.030 --> 02:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
supervisor and with the detectives that
 
02:13:13.550 --> 02:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
ran the case he'll go to a supervisor
 
02:13:16.550 --> 02:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
and it'll also go to a judge
 
02:13:19.069 --> 02:13:19.079 align:start position:0%
the next thing that I wanted to discuss
 
02:13:21.350 --> 02:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
uh was the president's speech I think it
 
02:13:23.569 --> 02:13:23.579 align:start position:0%
was stated earlier that the president
 
02:13:25.850 --> 02:13:25.860 align:start position:0%
was going to ban these
 
02:13:27.290 --> 02:13:27.300 align:start position:0%
I have the verbiage here it says
 
02:13:29.870 --> 02:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
restricts the use of no knock entries to
 
02:13:32.330 --> 02:13:32.340 align:start position:0%
a limited set of circumstances such as
 
02:13:33.770 --> 02:13:33.780 align:start position:0%
and went into entry would pose an
 
02:13:35.750 --> 02:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
imminent threat of physical violence
 
02:13:38.030 --> 02:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
that was from the president's speech and
 
02:13:39.950 --> 02:13:39.960 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what we do now
 
02:13:39.960 --> 02:13:41.569 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what we do now
we

02:13:41.569 --> 02:13:41.579 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:13:44.390 --> 02:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
we don't just do these on a whim it
 
02:13:45.709 --> 02:13:45.719 align:start position:0%
already reaches what the president is
 
02:13:47.629 --> 02:13:47.639 align:start position:0%
trying to push for that's the way we do
 
02:13:48.649 --> 02:13:48.659 align:start position:0%
it in the state of New Hampshire again
 
02:13:51.350 --> 02:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
as the president of the nhgoa
 
02:13:53.510 --> 02:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
these no knock search warrants are very
 
02:13:55.729 --> 02:13:55.739 align:start position:0%
rare they're very rare throughout the
 
02:13:57.109 --> 02:13:57.119 align:start position:0%
whole state
 
02:13:58.910 --> 02:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
um but again
 
02:14:00.890 --> 02:14:00.900 align:start position:0%
for the safety of the citizens for the
 
02:14:02.689 --> 02:14:02.699 align:start position:0%
safety of the accused right because we
 
02:14:04.729 --> 02:14:04.739 align:start position:0%
are not the judge during an execution or
 
02:14:06.830 --> 02:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
we understand the places we're going for
 
02:14:09.350 --> 02:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
people that are accused of something not
 
02:14:10.970 --> 02:14:10.980 align:start position:0%
necessarily always guilty of something
 
02:14:14.330 --> 02:14:14.340 align:start position:0%
so we understand they're the accused
 
02:14:17.089 --> 02:14:17.099 align:start position:0%
we create these plans for their safety
 
02:14:20.510 --> 02:14:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:21.950 --> 02:14:21.960 align:start position:0%
the swatting
 
02:14:21.960 --> 02:14:22.910 align:start position:0%
the swatting
um

02:14:22.910 --> 02:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:24.649 --> 02:14:24.659 align:start position:0%
the thing that was mentioned about this
 
02:14:27.350 --> 02:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
one there would not be a circumstance in
 
02:14:30.109 --> 02:14:30.119 align:start position:0%
swatting where it's a no knock search
 
02:14:33.290 --> 02:14:33.300 align:start position:0%
warrant the swatting scenarios that are
 
02:14:34.609 --> 02:14:34.619 align:start position:0%
happening around the country there's
 
02:14:36.169 --> 02:14:36.179 align:start position:0%
they're calling up and saying someone's
 
02:14:38.450 --> 02:14:38.460 align:start position:0%
actively being killed or someone's
 
02:14:40.850 --> 02:14:40.860 align:start position:0%
actively being stabbed under those
 
02:14:42.229 --> 02:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
circumstances we have the exemption
 
02:14:44.089 --> 02:14:44.099 align:start position:0%
we're not going to go back to the
 
02:14:45.589 --> 02:14:45.599 align:start position:0%
station call some detectives have them
 
02:14:47.390 --> 02:14:47.400 align:start position:0%
write up a search warrant go to a judge
 
02:14:49.370 --> 02:14:49.380 align:start position:0%
have the judge sign that while while
 
02:14:50.870 --> 02:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
someone's being stabbed if there's a
 
02:14:53.030 --> 02:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
swatting instance uh police officers are
 
02:14:54.649 --> 02:14:54.659 align:start position:0%
going to respond immediately and deal
 
02:14:58.370 --> 02:14:58.380 align:start position:0%
with that that threat immediately
 
02:14:58.380 --> 02:15:00.589 align:start position:0%
with that that threat immediately
um

02:15:00.589 --> 02:15:00.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:03.890 --> 02:15:03.900 align:start position:0%
and just the last one I know we had
 
02:15:07.250 --> 02:15:07.260 align:start position:0%
someone here up here from dcyf and I
 
02:15:09.290 --> 02:15:09.300 align:start position:0%
will tell you that I have been on the
 
02:15:12.109 --> 02:15:12.119 align:start position:0%
SWAT team for 15 years but
 
02:15:14.030 --> 02:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
I'm a de-escalation instructor I'm a
 
02:15:16.129 --> 02:15:16.139 align:start position:0%
cultural diversity instructor I'm a CIT
 
02:15:19.129 --> 02:15:19.139 align:start position:0%
instructor I'm a cism officer mental
 
02:15:21.410 --> 02:15:21.420 align:start position:0%
health for police and mental health for
 
02:15:23.689 --> 02:15:23.699 align:start position:0%
the citizens of New Hampshire is a very
 
02:15:26.810 --> 02:15:26.820 align:start position:0%
high priority for me I have never ever
 
02:15:28.370 --> 02:15:28.380 align:start position:0%
as a SWAT team member done anything with
 
02:15:28.380 --> 02:15:29.569 align:start position:0%
as a SWAT team member done anything with
dcyf

02:15:29.569 --> 02:15:29.579 align:start position:0%
dcyf
 
02:15:32.270 --> 02:15:32.280 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure what scenarios that
 
02:15:33.830 --> 02:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
person is talking about
 
02:15:36.410 --> 02:15:36.420 align:start position:0%
but I've never rammed a door kicked in a
 
02:15:40.010 --> 02:15:40.020 align:start position:0%
door and run in on a dcyf warn
 
02:15:41.810 --> 02:15:41.820 align:start position:0%
those are just a couple things that I've
 
02:15:43.729 --> 02:15:43.739 align:start position:0%
been listening to I wanted to discuss if
 
02:15:45.649 --> 02:15:45.659 align:start position:0%
you have any questions for me again as
 
02:15:47.870 --> 02:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
part of the nhgoa I'd be happy to answer
 
02:15:47.880 --> 02:15:49.129 align:start position:0%
part of the nhgoa I'd be happy to answer
that

02:15:49.129 --> 02:15:49.139 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:15:52.189 --> 02:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for that um I think the DC the
 
02:15:55.850 --> 02:15:55.860 align:start position:0%
former dcyf employee was saying that she
 
02:15:58.250 --> 02:15:58.260 align:start position:0%
had accompanied officers where they knew
 
02:16:00.109 --> 02:16:00.119 align:start position:0%
children were going to be there so that
 
02:16:02.030 --> 02:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
vcyf could take custody is that
 
02:16:03.169 --> 02:16:03.179 align:start position:0%
something that you've dealt with
 
02:16:03.179 --> 02:16:04.910 align:start position:0%
something that you've dealt with
possibly

02:16:04.910 --> 02:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
possibly
 
02:16:07.010 --> 02:16:07.020 align:start position:0%
I can't remember a specific instance
 
02:16:09.109 --> 02:16:09.119 align:start position:0%
where even that happened but if there
 
02:16:10.430 --> 02:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
was an instance where we knew that we
 
02:16:11.569 --> 02:16:11.579 align:start position:0%
were going to take the children I think
 
02:16:13.129 --> 02:16:13.139 align:start position:0%
that would be very responsible of us to
 
02:16:14.990 --> 02:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
make sure that we had juvenile officers
 
02:16:17.629 --> 02:16:17.639 align:start position:0%
there we had CIT officers there and we
 
02:16:19.669 --> 02:16:19.679 align:start position:0%
had members of uh outside organizations
 
02:16:21.109 --> 02:16:21.119 align:start position:0%
that could help us
 
02:16:23.390 --> 02:16:23.400 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and and for the
 
02:16:27.290 --> 02:16:27.300 align:start position:0%
committee's edification so you no longer
 
02:16:29.629 --> 02:16:29.639 align:start position:0%
do no knock search warrants is for
 
02:16:31.370 --> 02:16:31.380 align:start position:0%
evidence preservation in other words
 
02:16:33.650 --> 02:16:33.660 align:start position:0%
they have so much fentanyl if we knock
 
02:16:35.450 --> 02:16:35.460 align:start position:0%
on the door they're going to flush it
 
02:16:38.150 --> 02:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
that type of reason no and I've like I
 
02:16:40.070 --> 02:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
said I've been on the team uh for about
 
02:16:41.570 --> 02:16:41.580 align:start position:0%
15 years
 
02:16:44.209 --> 02:16:44.219 align:start position:0%
um and 15 years ago we would flow into a
 
02:16:46.849 --> 02:16:46.859 align:start position:0%
house I was talking to my team leader
 
02:16:49.070 --> 02:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
Sergeant Harrington in the back and in
 
02:16:51.950 --> 02:16:51.960 align:start position:0%
the last over two years I I can only say
 
02:16:53.750 --> 02:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
that maybe once that we could both
 
02:16:55.129 --> 02:16:55.139 align:start position:0%
recall together
 
02:16:58.070 --> 02:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
that we even entered the first room we
 
02:17:00.110 --> 02:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
don't flow through the houses anymore
 
02:17:02.209 --> 02:17:02.219 align:start position:0%
you know I understand that folks you
 
02:17:03.950 --> 02:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
know you folks and the citizens they
 
02:17:05.629 --> 02:17:05.639 align:start position:0%
look at these things I think the first
 
02:17:07.549 --> 02:17:07.559 align:start position:0%
instance was 2006 that was brought up
 
02:17:08.690 --> 02:17:08.700 align:start position:0%
today the second instant that was
 
02:17:11.209 --> 02:17:11.219 align:start position:0%
brought to say was 2011. where police
 
02:17:12.230 --> 02:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
officers did things that were
 
02:17:13.790 --> 02:17:13.800 align:start position:0%
inappropriate and that happens because
 
02:17:15.770 --> 02:17:15.780 align:start position:0%
we're human I understand that but we
 
02:17:17.150 --> 02:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
take those we do the after action
 
02:17:18.650 --> 02:17:18.660 align:start position:0%
reports and we learn from those and we
 
02:17:19.730 --> 02:17:19.740 align:start position:0%
make sure those things don't happen
 
02:17:22.070 --> 02:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
anymore that's why we have the lrad the
 
02:17:24.049 --> 02:17:24.059 align:start position:0%
long-range acoustical device to announce
 
02:17:26.690 --> 02:17:26.700 align:start position:0%
who we are that's why we don't flood
 
02:17:27.950 --> 02:17:27.960 align:start position:0%
through the house or flow through the
 
02:17:30.049 --> 02:17:30.059 align:start position:0%
house anymore but if you take this bill
 
02:17:31.549 --> 02:17:31.559 align:start position:0%
away we're not going to be able to
 
02:17:33.530 --> 02:17:33.540 align:start position:0%
breach and announce we're not going to
 
02:17:35.270 --> 02:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
be able to rake and break that window to
 
02:17:36.770 --> 02:17:36.780 align:start position:0%
look in to see if that person is
 
02:17:38.270 --> 02:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
grabbing a gun or to see if that person
 
02:17:40.370 --> 02:17:40.380 align:start position:0%
is running to a child's room to grab a
 
02:17:42.349 --> 02:17:42.359 align:start position:0%
child and take a hostage you're putting
 
02:17:44.690 --> 02:17:44.700 align:start position:0%
ourselves anyone on the opposite walls
 
02:17:47.330 --> 02:17:47.340 align:start position:0%
at danger and you're almost creating an
 
02:17:49.549 --> 02:17:49.559 align:start position:0%
environment where you're trapping that
 
02:17:50.990 --> 02:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
person and human beings don't like to be
 
02:17:52.310 --> 02:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
trapped they don't like to be backed
 
02:17:54.049 --> 02:17:54.059 align:start position:0%
into a corner we're trying to make sure
 
02:17:55.429 --> 02:17:55.439 align:start position:0%
that that doesn't happen we're trying to
 
02:17:57.009 --> 02:17:57.019 align:start position:0%
gain control of them immediately
 
02:17:59.270 --> 02:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
respectfully look I'll be honest we're
 
02:18:00.950 --> 02:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
not even allowed to swear all right
 
02:18:02.089 --> 02:18:02.099 align:start position:0%
we're not even allowed to curse We're
 
02:18:03.770 --> 02:18:03.780 align:start position:0%
very professional organization and that
 
02:18:05.089 --> 02:18:05.099 align:start position:0%
goes throughout the whole state of New
 
02:18:07.429 --> 02:18:07.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we're professional we do our
 
02:18:09.530 --> 02:18:09.540 align:start position:0%
jobs properly and and I would hate to
 
02:18:12.830 --> 02:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
see you know that tool as some people
 
02:18:14.450 --> 02:18:14.460 align:start position:0%
have called it being taken away from us
 
02:18:16.370 --> 02:18:16.380 align:start position:0%
because there are instances where it
 
02:18:18.709 --> 02:18:18.719 align:start position:0%
could put innocent civilians kids in
 
02:18:18.719 --> 02:18:20.929 align:start position:0%
could put innocent civilians kids in
danger

02:18:20.929 --> 02:18:20.939 align:start position:0%
danger
 
02:18:23.290 --> 02:18:23.300 align:start position:0%
thank you and one more question for me
 
02:18:25.910 --> 02:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
has the law enforcement in New Hampshire
 
02:18:29.450 --> 02:18:29.460 align:start position:0%
been able to utilize new technology to
 
02:18:31.790 --> 02:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
help them avoid situations like that for
 
02:18:33.709 --> 02:18:33.719 align:start position:0%
example thermal imaging to see what's
 
02:18:35.270 --> 02:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
going on inside of an apartment before
 
02:18:37.429 --> 02:18:37.439 align:start position:0%
they breach or anything like that
 
02:18:41.629 --> 02:18:41.639 align:start position:0%
so yeah so I again I I teach and I get
 
02:18:42.650 --> 02:18:42.660 align:start position:0%
to travel the country to teach other
 
02:18:45.169 --> 02:18:45.179 align:start position:0%
police officers and I will say this and
 
02:18:46.849 --> 02:18:46.859 align:start position:0%
you could never convince me the other
 
02:18:50.089 --> 02:18:50.099 align:start position:0%
we're a very well trained State and
 
02:18:52.969 --> 02:18:52.979 align:start position:0%
um our team has I think 10 drones
 
02:18:55.610 --> 02:18:55.620 align:start position:0%
um we have an i-core robot and we have
 
02:18:57.830 --> 02:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
um two we call them throw Bots and a lot
 
02:19:00.349 --> 02:19:00.359 align:start position:0%
of times on these no knock warrants when
 
02:19:02.570 --> 02:19:02.580 align:start position:0%
we reach that door we actually drop a
 
02:19:05.209 --> 02:19:05.219 align:start position:0%
robot and that robot can look up a set
 
02:19:06.349 --> 02:19:06.359 align:start position:0%
of stairs
 
02:19:07.849 --> 02:19:07.859 align:start position:0%
to make sure that even though we're
 
02:19:09.709 --> 02:19:09.719 align:start position:0%
still recessed outside we can see if
 
02:19:11.089 --> 02:19:11.099 align:start position:0%
somebody's coming down those stairs with
 
02:19:14.870 --> 02:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
a firearm we can we can talk to them
 
02:19:16.790 --> 02:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
through the robot we'll drive a robot in
 
02:19:18.410 --> 02:19:18.420 align:start position:0%
and say you know sir if you could just
 
02:19:19.849 --> 02:19:19.859 align:start position:0%
show me your hands you know we have a
 
02:19:21.230 --> 02:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
warrant for your arrest and they can
 
02:19:22.669 --> 02:19:22.679 align:start position:0%
talk to us back
 
02:19:24.410 --> 02:19:24.420 align:start position:0%
so we have all those things we are
 
02:19:26.389 --> 02:19:26.399 align:start position:0%
looking into currently some that looks
 
02:19:28.610 --> 02:19:28.620 align:start position:0%
through a wall we have to check the
 
02:19:30.410 --> 02:19:30.420 align:start position:0%
legalities of it we have to check all
 
02:19:31.610 --> 02:19:31.620 align:start position:0%
that stuff
 
02:19:33.830 --> 02:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
um but the other other states in this
 
02:19:35.929 --> 02:19:35.939 align:start position:0%
country already have those items but so
 
02:19:37.669 --> 02:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
we're working on it we do use technology
 
02:19:40.190 --> 02:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
quite a bit thank you
 
02:19:42.230 --> 02:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy
 
02:19:44.209 --> 02:19:44.219 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:19:47.209 --> 02:19:47.219 align:start position:0%
taking my question I too worked at dcyf
 
02:19:47.219 --> 02:19:48.110 align:start position:0%
taking my question I too worked at dcyf
when

02:19:48.110 --> 02:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
when
 
02:19:51.170 --> 02:19:51.180 align:start position:0%
um the um the woman came in and uh
 
02:19:53.450 --> 02:19:53.460 align:start position:0%
office testimony and I do not recall
 
02:19:55.250 --> 02:19:55.260 align:start position:0%
ever a SWAT
 
02:19:57.590 --> 02:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
um and while I do recall SWAT but not a
 
02:19:59.630 --> 02:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
no knock warrant uh in
 
02:19:59.640 --> 02:20:01.250 align:start position:0%
no knock warrant uh in
um incident

02:20:01.250 --> 02:20:01.260 align:start position:0%
um incident
 
02:20:04.429 --> 02:20:04.439 align:start position:0%
um I think maybe she was trying to
 
02:20:07.610 --> 02:20:07.620 align:start position:0%
um suggest which we did say because I
 
02:20:09.770 --> 02:20:09.780 align:start position:0%
too went to homes and sometimes I was a
 
02:20:11.750 --> 02:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
nurse coordinator uh in the in the
 
02:20:14.870 --> 02:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
Manchester Nashua Salem uh Concord
 
02:20:16.370 --> 02:20:16.380 align:start position:0%
district offices
 
02:20:19.190 --> 02:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
um and the she's what she suggested
 
02:20:21.889 --> 02:20:21.899 align:start position:0%
around the level of you know emotional
 
02:20:23.090 --> 02:20:23.100 align:start position:0%
and mental
 
02:20:25.790 --> 02:20:25.800 align:start position:0%
um uh health impact of those uh
 
02:20:28.510 --> 02:20:28.520 align:start position:0%
incidences involving children were
 
02:20:30.710 --> 02:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
important to acknowledge
 
02:20:33.590 --> 02:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
um but I I would agree I don't know that
 
02:20:36.410 --> 02:20:36.420 align:start position:0%
not in my recollection either was there
 
02:20:39.530 --> 02:20:39.540 align:start position:0%
a situation that involved a no-noc yeah
 
02:20:42.469 --> 02:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
and we wouldn't hesitate to call dcyf if
 
02:20:44.030 --> 02:20:44.040 align:start position:0%
we knew going in there that that person
 
02:20:45.410 --> 02:20:45.420 align:start position:0%
was going to go away for a really long
 
02:20:47.690 --> 02:20:47.700 align:start position:0%
time and they needed to be placed we
 
02:20:49.250 --> 02:20:49.260 align:start position:0%
would bring our juvenile division in
 
02:20:51.770 --> 02:20:51.780 align:start position:0%
like I said I'm a CIT instructor a cicm
 
02:20:53.690 --> 02:20:53.700 align:start position:0%
officer the mental health aspect is very
 
02:20:55.130 --> 02:20:55.140 align:start position:0%
important to me
 
02:20:55.140 --> 02:20:55.849 align:start position:0%
important to me
um

02:20:58.070 --> 02:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
maybe I misheard her from the back it
 
02:20:59.750 --> 02:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
almost seemed like they were
 
02:21:01.849 --> 02:21:01.859 align:start position:0%
we were doing a raid for them
 
02:21:03.650 --> 02:21:03.660 align:start position:0%
um and and that it's not something I
 
02:21:06.349 --> 02:21:06.359 align:start position:0%
could ever recall but well absolutely uh

I am now opening the public hearing on
 
02:31:51.180 --> 02:31:54.710 align:start position:0%
I am now opening the public hearing on
which

02:31:54.710 --> 02:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:58.370 --> 02:31:58.380 align:start position:0%
on hp156 relative to misconduct by a law
 
02:32:01.309 --> 02:32:01.319 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer
 
02:32:03.170 --> 02:32:03.180 align:start position:0%
we recognize the sponsor representative
 
02:32:05.750 --> 02:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
Muse to introduces bill
 
02:32:07.550 --> 02:32:07.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
02:32:09.650 --> 02:32:09.660 align:start position:0%
um I want to open by saying that I I
 
02:32:12.469 --> 02:32:12.479 align:start position:0%
think this is an issue that would only
 
02:32:15.830 --> 02:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
ever reply to a very very very small
 
02:32:19.010 --> 02:32:19.020 align:start position:0%
percentage of officers in New Hampshire
 
02:32:22.910 --> 02:32:22.920 align:start position:0%
um but based on the definition of of a
 
02:32:24.710 --> 02:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
police misconduct and I think based on
 
02:32:26.090 --> 02:32:26.100 align:start position:0%
some of the things that we've heard
 
02:32:29.210 --> 02:32:29.220 align:start position:0%
during some of our other hearings on
 
02:32:31.969 --> 02:32:31.979 align:start position:0%
these issues I do believe this is
 
02:32:35.330 --> 02:32:35.340 align:start position:0%
necessary this is actually a bill that
 
02:32:38.450 --> 02:32:38.460 align:start position:0%
Joseph lascaz of the uh New Hampshire
 
02:32:41.750 --> 02:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
American civil liberties Union asked me
 
02:32:45.230 --> 02:32:45.240 align:start position:0%
to file and to testify on unfortunately
 
02:32:47.630 --> 02:32:47.640 align:start position:0%
I'm not quite sure if Joseph is going to
 
02:32:51.110 --> 02:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
be available to testify on it today but
 
02:32:53.150 --> 02:32:53.160 align:start position:0%
I will try to answer as many of your
 
02:32:55.370 --> 02:32:55.380 align:start position:0%
questions and and do the best job that I
 
02:32:55.380 --> 02:32:56.349 align:start position:0%
questions and and do the best job that I
can

02:32:56.349 --> 02:32:56.359 align:start position:0%
can
 
02:32:58.790 --> 02:32:58.800 align:start position:0%
what the bill essentially does is it
 
02:33:00.770 --> 02:33:00.780 align:start position:0%
expands the definition of police conduct
 
02:33:02.469 --> 02:33:02.479 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire to include
 
02:33:05.389 --> 02:33:05.399 align:start position:0%
misrepresentation of a material fact in
 
02:33:08.150 --> 02:33:08.160 align:start position:0%
a police report or demonstrable
 
02:33:10.130 --> 02:33:10.140 align:start position:0%
misidentification of the race or
 
02:33:12.230 --> 02:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
ethnicity of an individual in a police
 
02:33:12.240 --> 02:33:14.270 align:start position:0%
ethnicity of an individual in a police
report

02:33:14.270 --> 02:33:14.280 align:start position:0%
report
 
02:33:16.610 --> 02:33:16.620 align:start position:0%
um as it does for other forms of defined
 
02:33:19.250 --> 02:33:19.260 align:start position:0%
misconduct under the current statute if
 
02:33:22.490 --> 02:33:22.500 align:start position:0%
another officer observes uh an officer
 
02:33:25.070 --> 02:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
engaging in this form of misconduct they
 
02:33:27.650 --> 02:33:27.660 align:start position:0%
would be required to notify uh their
 
02:33:29.030 --> 02:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
Chief their chief law enforcement
 
02:33:30.770 --> 02:33:30.780 align:start position:0%
officer in their Department in writing
 
02:33:32.990 --> 02:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
immediately or as soon as practical
 
02:33:35.690 --> 02:33:35.700 align:start position:0%
practicable after actually observing
 
02:33:38.990 --> 02:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
this type of misconduct
 
02:33:41.510 --> 02:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
um from there the uh the incident would
 
02:33:43.250 --> 02:33:43.260 align:start position:0%
go into the hands of the police
 
02:33:45.290 --> 02:33:45.300 align:start position:0%
standards and trainings people who would
 
02:33:47.230 --> 02:33:47.240 align:start position:0%
conduct a review
 
02:33:50.270 --> 02:33:50.280 align:start position:0%
again the bill the need for the bill
 
02:33:52.730 --> 02:33:52.740 align:start position:0%
really stems from the fact that over the
 
02:33:55.070 --> 02:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
course of several hearings on bills
 
02:33:56.650 --> 02:33:56.660 align:start position:0%
similar to this
 
02:33:59.450 --> 02:33:59.460 align:start position:0%
we have heard about incidents like this
 
02:34:02.570 --> 02:34:02.580 align:start position:0%
happening in our state and currently if
 
02:34:04.070 --> 02:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
you look at the definition of police
 
02:34:04.080 --> 02:34:06.010 align:start position:0%
you look at the definition of police
misconduct

02:34:06.010 --> 02:34:06.020 align:start position:0%
misconduct
 
02:34:11.330 --> 02:34:11.340 align:start position:0%
well uh while we cover a series of uh of
 
02:34:13.130 --> 02:34:13.140 align:start position:0%
of things that that constitute
 
02:34:15.170 --> 02:34:15.180 align:start position:0%
misconduct unfortunately these things
 
02:34:18.770 --> 02:34:18.780 align:start position:0%
are not are not represented in there
 
02:34:21.469 --> 02:34:21.479 align:start position:0%
um misrepresentation of of facts and and
 
02:34:23.389 --> 02:34:23.399 align:start position:0%
provable misidentification of a person
 
02:34:27.290 --> 02:34:27.300 align:start position:0%
in a police report may not seem like uh
 
02:34:29.750 --> 02:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
a very big deal when you compare it to
 
02:34:31.849 --> 02:34:31.859 align:start position:0%
things like assault and tampering with
 
02:34:33.410 --> 02:34:33.420 align:start position:0%
evidence and witness tampering and
 
02:34:36.230 --> 02:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
things like that but when these things
 
02:34:38.590 --> 02:34:38.600 align:start position:0%
do happen and when they do come to light
 
02:34:42.290 --> 02:34:42.300 align:start position:0%
they chip away at The credibility of
 
02:34:45.770 --> 02:34:45.780 align:start position:0%
police and I think this is a time when
 
02:34:47.690 --> 02:34:47.700 align:start position:0%
as much as we can we need to be building
 
02:34:50.510 --> 02:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
up that credibility and and sometimes we
 
02:34:54.349 --> 02:34:54.359 align:start position:0%
need to do systemic changes like this to
 
02:34:56.990 --> 02:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
actually help things along so this is
 
02:34:59.990 --> 02:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
not an attempt to hurt police or to
 
02:35:03.530 --> 02:35:03.540 align:start position:0%
punish police it's simply a an attempt
 
02:35:06.889 --> 02:35:06.899 align:start position:0%
to establish clearer and more focused
 
02:35:09.889 --> 02:35:09.899 align:start position:0%
guard rails around what is acceptable
 
02:35:12.110 --> 02:35:12.120 align:start position:0%
conduct and what is not acceptable
 
02:35:14.450 --> 02:35:14.460 align:start position:0%
conduct for a police officer
 
02:35:17.690 --> 02:35:17.700 align:start position:0%
I do not expect that this bill is going
 
02:35:21.190 --> 02:35:21.200 align:start position:0%
to result in a flood of misconduct cases
 
02:35:24.469 --> 02:35:24.479 align:start position:0%
for these for these reasons and again
 
02:35:26.210 --> 02:35:26.220 align:start position:0%
the reason is I think the vast majority
 
02:35:27.830 --> 02:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
of our police officer would never even
 
02:35:29.990 --> 02:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
think of doing things like this
 
02:35:31.730 --> 02:35:31.740 align:start position:0%
but unfortunately
 
02:35:33.650 --> 02:35:33.660 align:start position:0%
some of the ones who would might think
 
02:35:35.570 --> 02:35:35.580 align:start position:0%
of not only doing these things but might
 
02:35:37.730 --> 02:35:37.740 align:start position:0%
think of doing some of the other things
 
02:35:41.030 --> 02:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
that constitute misconduct as well uh
 
02:35:43.010 --> 02:35:43.020 align:start position:0%
and and essentially I think one of the
 
02:35:45.429 --> 02:35:45.439 align:start position:0%
things that we sometimes find is that
 
02:35:48.950 --> 02:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
small violations have a way of becoming
 
02:35:51.530 --> 02:35:51.540 align:start position:0%
bigger issues and potentially bigger
 
02:35:55.309 --> 02:35:55.319 align:start position:0%
violations uh later unless Behavior like
 
02:35:58.730 --> 02:35:58.740 align:start position:0%
this is actively discouraged and there
 
02:36:01.870 --> 02:36:01.880 align:start position:0%
are consequences for it when it happens
 
02:36:04.090 --> 02:36:04.100 align:start position:0%
so again
 
02:36:09.650 --> 02:36:09.660 align:start position:0%
this is uh this bill is uh is really
 
02:36:13.610 --> 02:36:13.620 align:start position:0%
designed uh I think to help improve The
 
02:36:15.469 --> 02:36:15.479 align:start position:0%
credibility of our police I think it's
 
02:36:17.270 --> 02:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
very much in line of some of the other
 
02:36:19.670 --> 02:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
things that we've been doing since
 
02:36:21.849 --> 02:36:21.859 align:start position:0%
governor sununu
 
02:36:23.630 --> 02:36:23.640 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
02:36:26.870 --> 02:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
assigned the police reform legislation
 
02:36:29.630 --> 02:36:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:32.030 --> 02:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
excuse me in 2021
 
02:36:34.370 --> 02:36:34.380 align:start position:0%
and I would urge you to vote out to pass
 
02:36:37.130 --> 02:36:37.140 align:start position:0%
and if I don't choke I will answer some
 
02:36:37.140 --> 02:36:38.870 align:start position:0%
and if I don't choke I will answer some
questions

02:36:38.870 --> 02:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:36:41.570 --> 02:36:41.580 align:start position:0%
thank you could could you give the
 
02:36:45.250 --> 02:36:45.260 align:start position:0%
comedian an example of um the the
 
02:36:47.750 --> 02:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
misidentifying portion of this
 
02:36:50.330 --> 02:36:50.340 align:start position:0%
yeah this is this is something that uh
 
02:36:52.550 --> 02:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
Joseph has mentioned several times in
 
02:36:55.309 --> 02:36:55.319 align:start position:0%
his testimony on different on various
 
02:36:56.929 --> 02:36:56.939 align:start position:0%
bills that have been front of us most of
 
02:36:59.330 --> 02:36:59.340 align:start position:0%
them involving racial profiling uh it
 
02:37:02.150 --> 02:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
was an incident of racial profiling
 
02:37:04.910 --> 02:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
um that that he was involved with as a
 
02:37:08.630 --> 02:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
as a victim uh where he said uh where he
 
02:37:10.910 --> 02:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
he basically told us that afterwards the
 
02:37:13.730 --> 02:37:13.740 align:start position:0%
police officer who recorded the incident
 
02:37:16.010 --> 02:37:16.020 align:start position:0%
um recorded him as being white
 
02:37:18.530 --> 02:37:18.540 align:start position:0%
and so during a time when we have other
 
02:37:20.870 --> 02:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
bills in front of us that would you know
 
02:37:22.190 --> 02:37:22.200 align:start position:0%
where we're looking at things like
 
02:37:24.710 --> 02:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
requiring um a change to Driver's
 
02:37:26.870 --> 02:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
Licenses to make
 
02:37:28.730 --> 02:37:28.740 align:start position:0%
um listing of race and ethnicity
 
02:37:31.370 --> 02:37:31.380 align:start position:0%
optional it's it's it's important that
 
02:37:32.990 --> 02:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
once we decide how we're going to start
 
02:37:36.710 --> 02:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
Gathering that data that were accurate
 
02:37:39.170 --> 02:37:39.180 align:start position:0%
about how we do it and I know one of the
 
02:37:40.730 --> 02:37:40.740 align:start position:0%
questions that's come up in the context
 
02:37:43.070 --> 02:37:43.080 align:start position:0%
of those bills is how do you enforce it
 
02:37:45.349 --> 02:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
well one way to enforce it is to make it
 
02:37:47.450 --> 02:37:47.460 align:start position:0%
actionable misconduct you know when you
 
02:37:47.460 --> 02:37:49.030 align:start position:0%
actionable misconduct you know when you
intentionally

02:37:49.030 --> 02:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
intentionally
 
02:37:51.410 --> 02:37:51.420 align:start position:0%
misidentify a person so that's really
 
02:37:54.590 --> 02:37:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:57.770 --> 02:37:57.780 align:start position:0%
do you believe that it should be tied to
 
02:37:59.990 --> 02:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
the other portion passing where someone
 
02:38:01.969 --> 02:38:01.979 align:start position:0%
has the option of identifying themselves
 
02:38:03.530 --> 02:38:03.540 align:start position:0%
so it's not up to the opposite of the
 
02:38:05.330 --> 02:38:05.340 align:start position:0%
guess in other words we don't want to
 
02:38:07.010 --> 02:38:07.020 align:start position:0%
punish officers for making a wrong guess
 
02:38:08.690 --> 02:38:08.700 align:start position:0%
about someone's identity their ethnic
 
02:38:10.370 --> 02:38:10.380 align:start position:0%
background so if the person has an
 
02:38:12.710 --> 02:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity to identify themselves and
 
02:38:14.530 --> 02:38:14.540 align:start position:0%
then the officer intentionally
 
02:38:17.450 --> 02:38:17.460 align:start position:0%
disregards that that I think would speak
 
02:38:19.250 --> 02:38:19.260 align:start position:0%
to what you're talking about but if the
 
02:38:20.690 --> 02:38:20.700 align:start position:0%
officer doesn't know and makes a wrong
 
02:38:22.010 --> 02:38:22.020 align:start position:0%
guess we wouldn't want to make them
 
02:38:24.410 --> 02:38:24.420 align:start position:0%
liable would we so you're absolutely
 
02:38:26.389 --> 02:38:26.399 align:start position:0%
right it would it would have the most
 
02:38:28.790 --> 02:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
impact if we passed the changes to our
 
02:38:31.730 --> 02:38:31.740 align:start position:0%
driver's license law if we if we pass
 
02:38:34.309 --> 02:38:34.319 align:start position:0%
the bill that basically prohibits racial
 
02:38:36.349 --> 02:38:36.359 align:start position:0%
profiling by law enforcement and we pass
 
02:38:38.690 --> 02:38:38.700 align:start position:0%
this bill the three bills together would
 
02:38:40.570 --> 02:38:40.580 align:start position:0%
have the most impact
 
02:38:42.830 --> 02:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we all know that's not the
 
02:38:44.690 --> 02:38:44.700 align:start position:0%
way the New Hampshire legislature always
 
02:38:48.170 --> 02:38:48.180 align:start position:0%
works and so one of the things that we
 
02:38:49.910 --> 02:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
deal with in all kinds of legislation
 
02:38:52.429 --> 02:38:52.439 align:start position:0%
from this kind of legislation to
 
02:38:54.590 --> 02:38:54.600 align:start position:0%
legislation around the environment
 
02:38:58.429 --> 02:38:58.439 align:start position:0%
is that sometimes we need to address an
 
02:39:00.830 --> 02:39:00.840 align:start position:0%
issue in in pieces which was the reason
 
02:39:02.870 --> 02:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
for three separate bills instead of one
 
02:39:04.910 --> 02:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
bill altogether
 
02:39:06.830 --> 02:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
um and and really hope that we can make
 
02:39:09.469 --> 02:39:09.479 align:start position:0%
an effective case for each one of those
 
02:39:12.050 --> 02:39:12.060 align:start position:0%
um and if we can those bills will get
 
02:39:14.030 --> 02:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
passed if we can't
 
02:39:17.150 --> 02:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
um then we will have to try again later
 
02:39:20.750 --> 02:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
um but uh that's basically
 
02:39:22.730 --> 02:39:22.740 align:start position:0%
that was basically our strategy in doing
 
02:39:24.590 --> 02:39:24.600 align:start position:0%
it this way
 
02:39:26.210 --> 02:39:26.220 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:39:28.849 --> 02:39:28.859 align:start position:0%
representative Newman
 
02:39:30.410 --> 02:39:30.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:39:32.750 --> 02:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:39:35.750 --> 02:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
um this bill modifies the definition of
 
02:39:38.450 --> 02:39:38.460 align:start position:0%
misconduct I assume misconduct would
 
02:39:40.490 --> 02:39:40.500 align:start position:0%
then you'd be guilty of
 
02:39:43.610 --> 02:39:43.620 align:start position:0%
improper of misconduct
 
02:39:45.889 --> 02:39:45.899 align:start position:0%
and I haven't read the law that is being
 
02:39:48.110 --> 02:39:48.120 align:start position:0%
modified but somewhere else in that law
 
02:39:49.790 --> 02:39:49.800 align:start position:0%
there is the definition of the
 
02:39:52.309 --> 02:39:52.319 align:start position:0%
punishments for yeah I can read you the
 
02:39:54.290 --> 02:39:54.300 align:start position:0%
current definition of misconduct uh
 
02:39:57.110 --> 02:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
income definition there is a penalty
 
02:40:00.230 --> 02:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
Associated maybe is there a penalty
 
02:40:02.630 --> 02:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
associated with that and is that part of
 
02:40:04.429 --> 02:40:04.439 align:start position:0%
the law that is quoted here you could
 
02:40:06.290 --> 02:40:06.300 align:start position:0%
find that penalty in the law
 
02:40:09.170 --> 02:40:09.180 align:start position:0%
there there's a there is a process uh
 
02:40:11.750 --> 02:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
for reporting incidents like this
 
02:40:15.349 --> 02:40:15.359 align:start position:0%
um and uh uh this is not a criminal it's
 
02:40:18.070 --> 02:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
it's not a criminal penalty the the the
 
02:40:20.809 --> 02:40:20.819 align:start position:0%
danger as I understand it or the
 
02:40:23.510 --> 02:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
consequences I understand it is the
 
02:40:26.150 --> 02:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
potential loss of certification
 
02:40:28.670 --> 02:40:28.680 align:start position:0%
um uh that from what else what I also
 
02:40:31.190 --> 02:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
understand that doesn't always happen uh
 
02:40:33.410 --> 02:40:33.420 align:start position:0%
there are warnings that are issued at
 
02:40:33.420 --> 02:40:34.370 align:start position:0%
there are warnings that are issued at
times

02:40:34.370 --> 02:40:34.380 align:start position:0%
times
 
02:40:35.809 --> 02:40:35.819 align:start position:0%
um I think
 
02:40:35.819 --> 02:40:36.770 align:start position:0%
um I think
um

02:40:36.770 --> 02:40:36.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:38.750 --> 02:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
you know for
 
02:40:41.630 --> 02:40:41.640 align:start position:0%
I think one of the things that uh police
 
02:40:43.730 --> 02:40:43.740 align:start position:0%
standards in training does a a very good
 
02:40:45.650 --> 02:40:45.660 align:start position:0%
job of is taking circumstances into
 
02:40:45.660 --> 02:40:47.210 align:start position:0%
job of is taking circumstances into
account

02:40:47.210 --> 02:40:47.220 align:start position:0%
account
 
02:40:49.010 --> 02:40:49.020 align:start position:0%
um so that I don't think anyone would be
 
02:40:51.950 --> 02:40:51.960 align:start position:0%
drummed out of their Department
 
02:40:55.610 --> 02:40:55.620 align:start position:0%
um for doing this one time or something
 
02:40:58.490 --> 02:40:58.500 align:start position:0%
you know or something like that unlike
 
02:41:00.050 --> 02:41:00.060 align:start position:0%
some of the other things in the
 
02:41:02.570 --> 02:41:02.580 align:start position:0%
definition of misconduct so things like
 
02:41:04.190 --> 02:41:04.200 align:start position:0%
assaulting people tampering with
 
02:41:04.200 --> 02:41:05.330 align:start position:0%
assaulting people tampering with
evidence

02:41:05.330 --> 02:41:05.340 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
02:41:07.250 --> 02:41:07.260 align:start position:0%
um those are those are much more serious
 
02:41:09.710 --> 02:41:09.720 align:start position:0%
and and I would imagine that from a
 
02:41:11.389 --> 02:41:11.399 align:start position:0%
certification perspective they would be
 
02:41:14.929 --> 02:41:14.939 align:start position:0%
dealt with in a much more serious way
 
02:41:18.110 --> 02:41:18.120 align:start position:0%
thank you representative scitec
 
02:41:21.650 --> 02:41:21.660 align:start position:0%
yes um representative Muse
 
02:41:23.690 --> 02:41:23.700 align:start position:0%
um a little bit something a little bit
 
02:41:26.750 --> 02:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
slippery you were talked about uh
 
02:41:30.170 --> 02:41:30.180 align:start position:0%
racial profiling and but I'm considering
 
02:41:31.910 --> 02:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
a driver's license is racial
 
02:41:34.849 --> 02:41:34.859 align:start position:0%
identification the profiling means I'm
 
02:41:38.750 --> 02:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
picking I'm picking on you you don't I
 
02:41:41.330 --> 02:41:41.340 align:start position:0%
don't see the the bill seems pretty
 
02:41:43.849 --> 02:41:43.859 align:start position:0%
reasonable I haven't heard from uh law
 
02:41:45.469 --> 02:41:45.479 align:start position:0%
enforcement but I did want to mention
 
02:41:47.929 --> 02:41:47.939 align:start position:0%
that profiling and identification are
 
02:41:50.510 --> 02:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
different in my mind the question I have
 
02:41:54.410 --> 02:41:54.420 align:start position:0%
is you have demonstrable is there a
 
02:41:56.389 --> 02:41:56.399 align:start position:0%
couple things occur to me should there
 
02:41:58.969 --> 02:41:58.979 align:start position:0%
be an intentional in there because look
 
02:42:01.670 --> 02:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
I write cbpos and I saw a guy I don't
 
02:42:03.349 --> 02:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
know how to identify him I wound up
 
02:42:05.210 --> 02:42:05.220 align:start position:0%
writing medium I didn't know what to say
 
02:42:08.150 --> 02:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
but I wasn't trying to be
 
02:42:11.750 --> 02:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
the other thing is what happens what
 
02:42:13.550 --> 02:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
recourse does the police do the police
 
02:42:16.490 --> 02:42:16.500 align:start position:0%
have if the guy
 
02:42:19.790 --> 02:42:19.800 align:start position:0%
wants to be difficult and to identify as
 
02:42:22.070 --> 02:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
being something else and it's clearly
 
02:42:23.510 --> 02:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
not there does please have an
 
02:42:28.010 --> 02:42:28.020 align:start position:0%
opportunity to this is the situation
 
02:42:29.510 --> 02:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
I don't know how to ask my question
 
02:42:32.150 --> 02:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
thanks well I think what we're what
 
02:42:33.530 --> 02:42:33.540 align:start position:0%
we're what you're what you're kind of
 
02:42:34.910 --> 02:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
getting at is
 
02:42:37.490 --> 02:42:37.500 align:start position:0%
um in in the way I would answer your
 
02:42:40.790 --> 02:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
question is is is if an uh kind of in
 
02:42:42.349 --> 02:42:42.359 align:start position:0%
the way that we tell people if you see
 
02:42:44.389 --> 02:42:44.399 align:start position:0%
something say something that's basically
 
02:42:46.490 --> 02:42:46.500 align:start position:0%
what we're telling uh other law
 
02:42:48.590 --> 02:42:48.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers to do if they
 
02:42:50.870 --> 02:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
notice this kind of contact in a
 
02:42:53.270 --> 02:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
colleague like other forms of misconduct
 
02:42:54.950 --> 02:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
this would be something that they have a
 
02:42:57.530 --> 02:42:57.540 align:start position:0%
duty uh to report up the chain
 
02:43:00.170 --> 02:43:00.180 align:start position:0%
in in terms of the use of the word uh
 
02:43:02.330 --> 02:43:02.340 align:start position:0%
demonstrable and uh it's interesting
 
02:43:05.090 --> 02:43:05.100 align:start position:0%
before my testimony I actually kind of
 
02:43:06.530 --> 02:43:06.540 align:start position:0%
was looking through the bill saying gee
 
02:43:08.150 --> 02:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
are there any words in there that may
 
02:43:10.550 --> 02:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
prove a little problematic
 
02:43:12.230 --> 02:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
um and one of the things that I did was
 
02:43:14.809 --> 02:43:14.819 align:start position:0%
I I actually looked up the uh the
 
02:43:16.969 --> 02:43:16.979 align:start position:0%
definition and demonstrable means uh
 
02:43:19.750 --> 02:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
clearly apparent or approvable
 
02:43:24.349 --> 02:43:24.359 align:start position:0%
and major Ebert offline uh before the
 
02:43:25.849 --> 02:43:25.859 align:start position:0%
hearing started actually brought up
 
02:43:27.290 --> 02:43:27.300 align:start position:0%
exactly the same issue around
 
02:43:29.330 --> 02:43:29.340 align:start position:0%
intentional that you did I think that is
 
02:43:31.849 --> 02:43:31.859 align:start position:0%
something you know we'd be more than
 
02:43:35.809 --> 02:43:35.819 align:start position:0%
willing to look at as a change uh uh I
 
02:43:37.610 --> 02:43:37.620 align:start position:0%
think sometimes as a committee we've
 
02:43:39.170 --> 02:43:39.180 align:start position:0%
we've kind of gotten wrapped around the
 
02:43:41.270 --> 02:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
axle with using the word intentional
 
02:43:43.090 --> 02:43:43.100 align:start position:0%
because proving intent
 
02:43:45.590 --> 02:43:45.600 align:start position:0%
can can be difficult but I think the
 
02:43:47.630 --> 02:43:47.640 align:start position:0%
issue here is we wouldn't want somebody
 
02:43:52.429 --> 02:43:52.439 align:start position:0%
who just records uh this data by a
 
02:43:54.230 --> 02:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
mistake especially given the fact that a
 
02:43:56.990 --> 02:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
lot my understanding is currently for a
 
02:43:58.670 --> 02:43:58.680 align:start position:0%
recipe it's for recorded in a drop down
 
02:43:58.680 --> 02:43:59.650 align:start position:0%
recipe it's for recorded in a drop down
menu

02:43:59.650 --> 02:43:59.660 align:start position:0%
menu
 
02:44:02.270 --> 02:44:02.280 align:start position:0%
and having used a few drop down menus
 
02:44:04.969 --> 02:44:04.979 align:start position:0%
over the years myself I know how easy it
 
02:44:07.730 --> 02:44:07.740 align:start position:0%
is to make a mistake so I so I think
 
02:44:10.309 --> 02:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
your point is well taken and that would
 
02:44:12.050 --> 02:44:12.060 align:start position:0%
and I would hope that would be something
 
02:44:13.610 --> 02:44:13.620 align:start position:0%
that the committee would consider
 
02:44:16.610 --> 02:44:16.620 align:start position:0%
looking at as well
 
02:44:19.670 --> 02:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
I think if I made Dean to speak for
 
02:44:21.710 --> 02:44:21.720 align:start position:0%
representative scitec he was also asking
 
02:44:25.670 --> 02:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
if you have a suspect who um who's
 
02:44:28.070 --> 02:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
clearly a Caucasian and says I identify
 
02:44:30.410 --> 02:44:30.420 align:start position:0%
as African-American and the officer
 
02:44:32.090 --> 02:44:32.100 align:start position:0%
writes down Caucasian because that's
 
02:44:35.270 --> 02:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
what he observably is is there any kind
 
02:44:37.490 --> 02:44:37.500 align:start position:0%
of a contemplation about how how that
 
02:44:40.550 --> 02:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:44.030 --> 02:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
I I think I think part of it gets to uh
 
02:44:47.030 --> 02:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
it actually may get to intent so you
 
02:44:50.690 --> 02:44:50.700 align:start position:0%
know what is what is you know is this is
 
02:44:52.849 --> 02:44:52.859 align:start position:0%
this a mistake why is why did this why
 
02:44:55.610 --> 02:44:55.620 align:start position:0%
did this happen I think the you know the
 
02:44:58.309 --> 02:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
issue is is if you see it happen
 
02:45:00.710 --> 02:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
um it should be reported so that that
 
02:45:03.110 --> 02:45:03.120 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be uh in like the other forms
 
02:45:05.690 --> 02:45:05.700 align:start position:0%
of misconduct the expectation would be
 
02:45:07.429 --> 02:45:07.439 align:start position:0%
that if this is something that another
 
02:45:09.349 --> 02:45:09.359 align:start position:0%
police officer observes or someone else
 
02:45:11.450 --> 02:45:11.460 align:start position:0%
in the department it would be reported
 
02:45:15.230 --> 02:45:15.240 align:start position:0%
and like any anything there can be a
 
02:45:17.330 --> 02:45:17.340 align:start position:0%
perfectly logical reasonable explanation
 
02:45:19.730 --> 02:45:19.740 align:start position:0%
for it that would come up during a
 
02:45:22.010 --> 02:45:22.020 align:start position:0%
hearing or come up with the chief or
 
02:45:24.469 --> 02:45:24.479 align:start position:0%
come up during some part of the process
 
02:45:24.479 --> 02:45:26.270 align:start position:0%
come up during some part of the process
so

02:45:26.270 --> 02:45:26.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:45:28.250 --> 02:45:28.260 align:start position:0%
um again
 
02:45:30.110 --> 02:45:30.120 align:start position:0%
you know what we're what we're really
 
02:45:32.929 --> 02:45:32.939 align:start position:0%
trying to do here is to you know to do a
 
02:45:34.190 --> 02:45:34.200 align:start position:0%
couple of things
 
02:45:36.309 --> 02:45:36.319 align:start position:0%
um we want to make sure that
 
02:45:38.870 --> 02:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
misrepresentation of material facts in a
 
02:45:41.990 --> 02:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
report which is I don't think anything
 
02:45:43.969 --> 02:45:43.979 align:start position:0%
uh any
 
02:45:47.450 --> 02:45:47.460 align:start position:0%
police officer or any any law
 
02:45:48.950 --> 02:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
enforcement official would would ever
 
02:45:48.960 --> 02:45:50.150 align:start position:0%
enforcement official would would ever
condone

02:45:50.150 --> 02:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
condone
 
02:45:51.950 --> 02:45:51.960 align:start position:0%
um then we're just making sure that that
 
02:45:54.469 --> 02:45:54.479 align:start position:0%
is added to our uh our standards for
 
02:45:54.479 --> 02:45:56.090 align:start position:0%
is added to our uh our standards for
misconduct

02:45:56.090 --> 02:45:56.100 align:start position:0%
misconduct
 
02:45:58.790 --> 02:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
um the the misidentification of racer
 
02:46:01.070 --> 02:46:01.080 align:start position:0%
ethnicity uh maybe a little bit of a
 
02:46:02.690 --> 02:46:02.700 align:start position:0%
stretch for now given the fact that we
 
02:46:06.469 --> 02:46:06.479 align:start position:0%
actually don't have a a
 
02:46:09.170 --> 02:46:09.180 align:start position:0%
a An approved data Gathering mechanism
 
02:46:11.750 --> 02:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
for that in place when it comes to stops
 
02:46:14.870 --> 02:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
however I do believe that for arrests we
 
02:46:16.910 --> 02:46:16.920 align:start position:0%
do but that's that's also something
 
02:46:19.610 --> 02:46:19.620 align:start position:0%
where there's a lot less incentive to uh
 
02:46:22.010 --> 02:46:22.020 align:start position:0%
to put in uh information that wouldn't
 
02:46:26.030 --> 02:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:27.650 --> 02:46:27.660 align:start position:0%
representative Reed
 
02:46:30.590 --> 02:46:30.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so you mentioned
 
02:46:32.570 --> 02:46:32.580 align:start position:0%
um a few times about if you see
 
02:46:34.130 --> 02:46:34.140 align:start position:0%
something say something but the bill
 
02:46:36.950 --> 02:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
makes no mention of that if you see
 
02:46:40.070 --> 02:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
something say something so
 
02:46:42.410 --> 02:46:42.420 align:start position:0%
um my if I reading this my understanding
 
02:46:45.010 --> 02:46:45.020 align:start position:0%
is if there is a question about
 
02:46:48.290 --> 02:46:48.300 align:start position:0%
misidentification of race or race or
 
02:46:52.190 --> 02:46:52.200 align:start position:0%
ethnicity it would be from the person
 
02:46:55.070 --> 02:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
um the defendant themselves so what
 
02:46:57.790 --> 02:46:57.800 align:start position:0%
you're saying is this bill is expecting
 
02:47:00.710 --> 02:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
police officers to assume intent of
 
02:47:02.750 --> 02:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
another police officer and file a
 
02:47:05.150 --> 02:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
complaint am I correct
 
02:47:05.160 --> 02:47:05.990 align:start position:0%
complaint am I correct
um

02:47:05.990 --> 02:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:47:08.270 --> 02:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
this is part of the issue with the bills
 
02:47:10.809 --> 02:47:10.819 align:start position:0%
the way that we get them so
 
02:47:13.730 --> 02:47:13.740 align:start position:0%
my bill only makes a material change to
 
02:47:16.670 --> 02:47:16.680 align:start position:0%
part one of the statute there's also a
 
02:47:18.590 --> 02:47:18.600 align:start position:0%
part two a part three and a part four
 
02:47:21.950 --> 02:47:21.960 align:start position:0%
and the part two gets into what I've
 
02:47:25.070 --> 02:47:25.080 align:start position:0%
discussed about the duty of other law
 
02:47:27.050 --> 02:47:27.060 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers to report this when
 
02:47:28.250 --> 02:47:28.260 align:start position:0%
they see it
 
02:47:36.410 --> 02:47:36.420 align:start position:0%
so this is a Section 105 colon colon 19.
 
02:47:38.870 --> 02:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
in other words it's already in statute
 
02:47:40.389 --> 02:47:40.399 align:start position:0%
that an officer has to report
 
02:47:42.710 --> 02:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
representative Mania
 
02:47:44.090 --> 02:47:44.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:47:46.670 --> 02:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
taking taking my question do you know if
 
02:47:48.410 --> 02:47:48.420 align:start position:0%
this would trigger the officer being
 
02:47:50.750 --> 02:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
added to the Lorry list I'm sorry could
 
02:47:52.550 --> 02:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
you speak into your mic do you know if
 
02:47:54.170 --> 02:47:54.180 align:start position:0%
this would trigger the officer being
 
02:47:56.750 --> 02:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
added to the Lorry list a violist of the
 
02:47:56.760 --> 02:47:57.710 align:start position:0%
added to the Lorry list a violist of the
statute

02:47:57.710 --> 02:47:57.720 align:start position:0%
statute
 
02:48:00.230 --> 02:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
if it would trigger I'm sorry them being
 
02:48:02.870 --> 02:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
added to the Lorry list in New Hampshire
 
02:48:05.809 --> 02:48:05.819 align:start position:0%
added to the Lorry list if it is if it
 
02:48:08.809 --> 02:48:08.819 align:start position:0%
is a form of police misconduct my
 
02:48:10.790 --> 02:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
understanding of the way that the of
 
02:48:14.530 --> 02:48:14.540 align:start position:0%
that that list works is it it could be
 
02:48:17.570 --> 02:48:17.580 align:start position:0%
that actually isn't an issue that I have
 
02:48:19.730 --> 02:48:19.740 align:start position:0%
have thought through probably as well as
 
02:48:22.969 --> 02:48:22.979 align:start position:0%
I should but um but I would say it's
 
02:48:25.130 --> 02:48:25.140 align:start position:0%
distinct possibility given the way the
 
02:48:29.389 --> 02:48:29.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:33.410 --> 02:48:33.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:37.550 --> 02:48:37.560 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes John bryoph John
 
02:48:40.250 --> 02:48:40.260 align:start position:0%
Bry fonsky
 
02:48:44.870 --> 02:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:48.889 --> 02:48:48.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:50.690 --> 02:48:50.700 align:start position:0%
don't be sorry it comes out a lot worse
 
02:48:52.910 --> 02:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
than a lot of other pieces
 
02:48:55.730 --> 02:48:55.740 align:start position:0%
well good afternoon uh Mr chair and
 
02:48:56.929 --> 02:48:56.939 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is John
 
02:48:59.150 --> 02:48:59.160 align:start position:0%
brofonski I'm the current chief of
 
02:49:01.130 --> 02:49:01.140 align:start position:0%
police in Bedford New Hampshire
 
02:49:03.469 --> 02:49:03.479 align:start position:0%
for more than 11 years I've been
 
02:49:05.270 --> 02:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
continuously serving in law enforcement
 
02:49:08.150 --> 02:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
throughout the country for almost 45
 
02:49:08.160 --> 02:49:09.469 align:start position:0%
throughout the country for almost 45
years

02:49:09.469 --> 02:49:09.479 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:49:14.090 --> 02:49:14.100 align:start position:0%
part of that duties involved being an
 
02:49:17.030 --> 02:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
inspector and Deputy Chief Inspector and
 
02:49:20.510 --> 02:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
in charge of internal affairs for DEA
 
02:49:23.210 --> 02:49:23.220 align:start position:0%
worldwide for a number of years which
 
02:49:26.270 --> 02:49:26.280 align:start position:0%
means that I have a lot of experience in
 
02:49:28.309 --> 02:49:28.319 align:start position:0%
misconduct cases
 
02:49:29.929 --> 02:49:29.939 align:start position:0%
I'm here representing the New Hampshire
 
02:49:32.030 --> 02:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
Association Chiefs of police who are
 
02:49:33.770 --> 02:49:33.780 align:start position:0%
opposed to this bill
 
02:49:35.510 --> 02:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
but we're not opposed to honesty
 
02:49:38.570 --> 02:49:38.580 align:start position:0%
integrity and ethical conduct of law
 
02:49:40.969 --> 02:49:40.979 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers that is in fact the
 
02:49:43.550 --> 02:49:43.560 align:start position:0%
Bedrock upon which law enforcement here
 
02:49:44.929 --> 02:49:44.939 align:start position:0%
in the granite state and everywhere
 
02:49:48.550 --> 02:49:48.560 align:start position:0%
actually is based honesty Integrity is
 
02:49:52.429 --> 02:49:52.439 align:start position:0%
critical to maintaining the public trust
 
02:49:54.830 --> 02:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
and confidence in law enforcement and
 
02:49:58.490 --> 02:49:58.500 align:start position:0%
you members of the legislature so uh it
 
02:50:02.450 --> 02:50:02.460 align:start position:0%
is uh odd that we would be opposed to uh
 
02:50:05.090 --> 02:50:05.100 align:start position:0%
this particular language but we're
 
02:50:07.010 --> 02:50:07.020 align:start position:0%
opposed to it simply because it's
 
02:50:10.790 --> 02:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
duplicated in our view and it is uh
 
02:50:15.770 --> 02:50:15.780 align:start position:0%
vague and would cast a wide net uh if
 
02:50:19.370 --> 02:50:19.380 align:start position:0%
you will and it's ill-defined so for
 
02:50:20.990 --> 02:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
those reasons we're opposed to the bill
 
02:50:22.730 --> 02:50:22.740 align:start position:0%
so let's take it apart piece by piece
 
02:50:25.929 --> 02:50:25.939 align:start position:0%
first of all currently under state law
 
02:50:30.889 --> 02:50:30.899 align:start position:0%
RSA 641 colon 1 perjury 641 colon 2
 
02:50:33.410 --> 02:50:33.420 align:start position:0%
which is uh falsification sworn
 
02:50:37.370 --> 02:50:37.380 align:start position:0%
falsification 641 colon 3 is unsworn
 
02:50:40.190 --> 02:50:40.200 align:start position:0%
falsification now with respect to police
 
02:50:43.610 --> 02:50:43.620 align:start position:0%
reports 641 colon 3 which would which is
 
02:50:46.130 --> 02:50:46.140 align:start position:0%
a misdemeanor if found guilty
 
02:50:49.690 --> 02:50:49.700 align:start position:0%
of that particular crime would cover
 
02:50:53.150 --> 02:50:53.160 align:start position:0%
falsification of information on a police
 
02:50:55.570 --> 02:50:55.580 align:start position:0%
report misrepresentation
 
02:50:59.750 --> 02:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
is language that if it were defined as
 
02:50:59.760 --> 02:51:01.210 align:start position:0%
is language that if it were defined as
intentional

02:51:01.210 --> 02:51:01.220 align:start position:0%
intentional
 
02:51:03.469 --> 02:51:03.479 align:start position:0%
misrepresentation of a material
 
02:51:05.570 --> 02:51:05.580 align:start position:0%
misstatement effect which would fall
 
02:51:10.490 --> 02:51:10.500 align:start position:0%
under the 640 641 colon 3 other already
 
02:51:14.570 --> 02:51:14.580 align:start position:0%
is currently in law prohibition and a
 
02:51:17.990 --> 02:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
crime of that makes it a misdemeanor to
 
02:51:21.230 --> 02:51:21.240 align:start position:0%
commit that act in addition the policies
 
02:51:22.550 --> 02:51:22.560 align:start position:0%
and procedures of the New Hampshire
 
02:51:25.910 --> 02:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
police training Council which governs
 
02:51:27.349 --> 02:51:27.359 align:start position:0%
the certification of Law Enforcement
 
02:51:30.530 --> 02:51:30.540 align:start position:0%
Officers here in the granite state also
 
02:51:33.530 --> 02:51:33.540 align:start position:0%
makes making a false statement which
 
02:51:35.690 --> 02:51:35.700 align:start position:0%
includes a material misstatement effect
 
02:51:39.050 --> 02:51:39.060 align:start position:0%
which is defined as making a statement
 
02:51:41.389 --> 02:51:41.399 align:start position:0%
knowing that it is not true so
 
02:51:44.090 --> 02:51:44.100 align:start position:0%
essentially false statement is in fact
 
02:51:47.570 --> 02:51:47.580 align:start position:0%
sworn and unsworn falsification of
 
02:51:47.580 --> 02:51:49.130 align:start position:0%
sworn and unsworn falsification of
information

02:51:49.130 --> 02:51:49.140 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:51:51.710 --> 02:51:51.720 align:start position:0%
if the bill were to Define an
 
02:51:54.590 --> 02:51:54.600 align:start position:0%
intentional intentional material
 
02:51:56.750 --> 02:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
misrepresentation of fact we would not
 
02:51:58.429 --> 02:51:58.439 align:start position:0%
be opposed to that particular language
 
02:52:01.610 --> 02:52:01.620 align:start position:0%
because an intentional is clearly
 
02:52:03.710 --> 02:52:03.720 align:start position:0%
defines as the act that the law
 
02:52:06.590 --> 02:52:06.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer made was intentional
 
02:52:08.870 --> 02:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
that there's culpability a culpable
 
02:52:12.590 --> 02:52:12.600 align:start position:0%
State of Mind to deceive an official in
 
02:52:15.590 --> 02:52:15.600 align:start position:0%
connection with filing a false report
 
02:52:17.929 --> 02:52:17.939 align:start position:0%
with respect to the misidentification of
 
02:52:20.750 --> 02:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
an individual for race and ethnic
 
02:52:23.330 --> 02:52:23.340 align:start position:0%
ethnicity the first and foremost problem
 
02:52:26.269 --> 02:52:26.279 align:start position:0%
is that uh oftentimes unless the
 
02:52:27.730 --> 02:52:27.740 align:start position:0%
individual him or herself
 
02:52:30.769 --> 02:52:30.779 align:start position:0%
self-identifies to the officer there are
 
02:52:32.830 --> 02:52:32.840 align:start position:0%
many many cases which you can I'm sure
 
02:52:35.450 --> 02:52:35.460 align:start position:0%
uh conjure up in your mind whether it's
 
02:52:37.490 --> 02:52:37.500 align:start position:0%
respect to people that you know
 
02:52:40.130 --> 02:52:40.140 align:start position:0%
celebrities athletes and so forth in
 
02:52:42.650 --> 02:52:42.660 align:start position:0%
which an individual's race and ethnicity
 
02:52:46.730 --> 02:52:46.740 align:start position:0%
is not always clearly identifiable
 
02:52:49.610 --> 02:52:49.620 align:start position:0%
currently if there were to be a
 
02:52:49.620 --> 02:52:50.570 align:start position:0%
currently if there were to be a
requirement

02:52:50.570 --> 02:52:50.580 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
02:52:54.110 --> 02:52:54.120 align:start position:0%
for individuals to self-identify on
 
02:52:56.230 --> 02:52:56.240 align:start position:0%
their New Hampshire driver's license
 
02:52:58.969 --> 02:52:58.979 align:start position:0%
that particular mystery would be solved
 
02:53:01.910 --> 02:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
but currently that is not the case so
 
02:53:03.830 --> 02:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
therefore there would be a number of
 
02:53:08.570 --> 02:53:08.580 align:start position:0%
cases in which an officer may make a
 
02:53:11.570 --> 02:53:11.580 align:start position:0%
guess based on his or her worldly
 
02:53:15.410 --> 02:53:15.420 align:start position:0%
experience right there's no class in the
 
02:53:17.809 --> 02:53:17.819 align:start position:0%
police academy that helps officers
 
02:53:21.590 --> 02:53:21.600 align:start position:0%
identify race and ethnicity right and
 
02:53:25.550 --> 02:53:25.560 align:start position:0%
it's not clear to people to you and I so
 
02:53:30.170 --> 02:53:30.180 align:start position:0%
that would wrap police officers into a
 
02:53:32.870 --> 02:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
misconduct matter for which they did
 
02:53:35.870 --> 02:53:35.880 align:start position:0%
nothing outside of their
 
02:53:37.730 --> 02:53:37.740 align:start position:0%
scope of their duties and
 
02:53:40.190 --> 02:53:40.200 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and would not be in
 
02:53:42.349 --> 02:53:42.359 align:start position:0%
violation of their ethical conduct they
 
02:53:45.950 --> 02:53:45.960 align:start position:0%
simply made an informed decision and
 
02:53:49.790 --> 02:53:49.800 align:start position:0%
guess and it was wrong so we would be
 
02:53:51.830 --> 02:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
opposed to this bill for for these and
 
02:53:53.269 --> 02:53:53.279 align:start position:0%
many reasons I have written testimony
 
02:53:55.250 --> 02:53:55.260 align:start position:0%
that I will give to the members of the
 
02:53:59.450 --> 02:53:59.460 align:start position:0%
committee after I'm done but again those
 
02:54:01.670 --> 02:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
are the major tenants and issues that
 
02:54:03.230 --> 02:54:03.240 align:start position:0%
that we face in this particular Bill
 
02:54:05.030 --> 02:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
given the language thank you for taking
 
02:54:10.130 --> 02:54:10.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:14.809 --> 02:54:14.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:14.819 --> 02:54:18.410 align:start position:0%
 
traffic

02:54:18.410 --> 02:54:18.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:21.290 --> 02:54:21.300 align:start position:0%
stop you're not given a ticket but on a
 
02:54:23.690 --> 02:54:23.700 align:start position:0%
traffic stop today
 
02:54:25.730 --> 02:54:25.740 align:start position:0%
officers can put whether they're black
 
02:54:28.309 --> 02:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
white or whatever on their ticket when
 
02:54:30.950 --> 02:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
they file their report you know as law
 
02:54:30.960 --> 02:54:32.269 align:start position:0%
they file their report you know as law
enforcement

02:54:32.269 --> 02:54:32.279 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
02:54:35.570 --> 02:54:35.580 align:start position:0%
so if that's the case and someone says
 
02:54:38.870 --> 02:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
let's say they stop me and I'm obviously
 
02:54:40.969 --> 02:54:40.979 align:start position:0%
identified as a black female
 
02:54:43.610 --> 02:54:43.620 align:start position:0%
but on that report it says I'm a white
 
02:54:43.620 --> 02:54:45.050 align:start position:0%
but on that report it says I'm a white
female

02:54:45.050 --> 02:54:45.060 align:start position:0%
female
 
02:54:47.570 --> 02:54:47.580 align:start position:0%
so today do you have anything in place
 
02:54:50.570 --> 02:54:50.580 align:start position:0%
that deals with that type of situation
 
02:54:53.570 --> 02:54:53.580 align:start position:0%
yes that's uh that would be misconduct
 
02:54:55.490 --> 02:54:55.500 align:start position:0%
um in Bedford Police Department and when
 
02:54:58.309 --> 02:54:58.319 align:start position:0%
officers stop someone they have to issue
 
02:55:00.530 --> 02:55:00.540 align:start position:0%
even if it's a warning uh they issue a
 
02:55:02.450 --> 02:55:02.460 align:start position:0%
written warning and and on that written
 
02:55:04.490 --> 02:55:04.500 align:start position:0%
warning is uh demographic information
 
02:55:06.769 --> 02:55:06.779 align:start position:0%
with respect to the operator of the
 
02:55:09.050 --> 02:55:09.060 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle uh if it comes to our
 
02:55:12.490 --> 02:55:12.500 align:start position:0%
attention that an officer intentionally
 
02:55:14.929 --> 02:55:14.939 align:start position:0%
or unintentional we don't know until
 
02:55:17.330 --> 02:55:17.340 align:start position:0%
there's an investigation clearly places
 
02:55:20.030 --> 02:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
information on that ticket that is
 
02:55:23.210 --> 02:55:23.220 align:start position:0%
inaccurate and in the case that you just
 
02:55:26.510 --> 02:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
described if that were to be the case
 
02:55:29.750 --> 02:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh and a internal affairs investigation
 
02:55:31.510 --> 02:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
was conducted and interviewed you
 
02:55:34.429 --> 02:55:34.439 align:start position:0%
clearly identified your race and
 
02:55:36.950 --> 02:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
ethnicity as being inconsistent with
 
02:55:39.110 --> 02:55:39.120 align:start position:0%
what was written on the report that's
 
02:55:40.849 --> 02:55:40.859 align:start position:0%
making a false statement that officer
 
02:55:43.330 --> 02:55:43.340 align:start position:0%
would be subject to misconduct
 
02:55:46.870 --> 02:55:46.880 align:start position:0%
allegations would likely be fired by me
 
02:55:50.030 --> 02:55:50.040 align:start position:0%
and perhaps face a criminal charge and
 
02:55:52.370 --> 02:55:52.380 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor charge and likely be subject
 
02:55:54.710 --> 02:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
to losing his or her certification as a
 
02:55:56.889 --> 02:55:56.899 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officer
 
02:55:58.670 --> 02:55:58.680 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
02:56:02.090 --> 02:56:02.100 align:start position:0%
okay so given the case of myself that I
 
02:56:05.750 --> 02:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
just mentioned then um and I filed a
 
02:56:07.550 --> 02:56:07.560 align:start position:0%
complaint with you
 
02:56:10.969 --> 02:56:10.979 align:start position:0%
am I notified as to what happened
 
02:56:14.570 --> 02:56:14.580 align:start position:0%
in that situation you can certainly
 
02:56:17.090 --> 02:56:17.100 align:start position:0%
request that information via 91a once
 
02:56:19.130 --> 02:56:19.140 align:start position:0%
the investigation is complete
 
02:56:20.690 --> 02:56:20.700 align:start position:0%
um those reports
 
02:56:23.750 --> 02:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
um of misconduct investigations that I
 
02:56:23.760 --> 02:56:24.590 align:start position:0%
um of misconduct investigations that I
um

02:56:24.590 --> 02:56:24.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:56:27.530 --> 02:56:27.540 align:start position:0%
have released to the public and some of
 
02:56:29.210 --> 02:56:29.220 align:start position:0%
which are in the union leader are
 
02:56:31.790 --> 02:56:31.800 align:start position:0%
subject to redaction based on the
 
02:56:33.889 --> 02:56:33.899 align:start position:0%
attorneys that are hired by the
 
02:56:37.790 --> 02:56:37.800 align:start position:0%
municipality to follow the the rules and
 
02:56:40.250 --> 02:56:40.260 align:start position:0%
regulations of 91a but yes you would you
 
02:56:42.290 --> 02:56:42.300 align:start position:0%
would ultimately find out what occurred
 
02:56:46.910 --> 02:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:50.809 --> 02:56:50.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:53.090 --> 02:56:53.100 align:start position:0%
could you just clarify for me
 
02:56:55.429 --> 02:56:55.439 align:start position:0%
um in testimony we had over this issue
 
02:56:57.769 --> 02:56:57.779 align:start position:0%
of profiling and race
 
02:57:01.010 --> 02:57:01.020 align:start position:0%
um I I was of the impression that it's
 
02:57:02.750 --> 02:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
not required on a driver's license it's
 
02:57:04.550 --> 02:57:04.560 align:start position:0%
not on a driver's license and that there
 
02:57:06.290 --> 02:57:06.300 align:start position:0%
was difficulty in determining the race
 
02:57:08.750 --> 02:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
and and all those kind of things
 
02:57:11.269 --> 02:57:11.279 align:start position:0%
is is there a requirement like it
 
02:57:13.510 --> 02:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
sounded to me like your testimony was
 
02:57:17.510 --> 02:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
that in that example even if they got a
 
02:57:19.849 --> 02:57:19.859 align:start position:0%
warning there was a there was somewhere
 
02:57:22.130 --> 02:57:22.140 align:start position:0%
on what they report for warnings and
 
02:57:25.010 --> 02:57:25.020 align:start position:0%
traffic stops that the race has to be
 
02:57:26.809 --> 02:57:26.819 align:start position:0%
recorded is that or am I
 
02:57:28.070 --> 02:57:28.080 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding that there's
 
02:57:29.269 --> 02:57:29.279 align:start position:0%
information there's demographic
 
02:57:31.190 --> 02:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
information that our records and
 
02:57:33.830 --> 02:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
management system requires the officer
 
02:57:36.950 --> 02:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
to input so that we obtain demographic
 
02:57:38.870 --> 02:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
data on Motor Vehicle stops including
 
02:57:41.330 --> 02:57:41.340 align:start position:0%
warnings right so that demographic
 
02:57:43.250 --> 02:57:43.260 align:start position:0%
information is there we run those
 
02:57:46.730 --> 02:57:46.740 align:start position:0%
reports on a routine basis consistent
 
02:57:49.910 --> 02:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
with accreditation standards to ensure
 
02:57:52.550 --> 02:57:52.560 align:start position:0%
that the department is following its
 
02:57:54.349 --> 02:57:54.359 align:start position:0%
policies and procedures
 
02:57:57.230 --> 02:57:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:59.389 --> 02:57:59.399 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy
 
02:58:00.950 --> 02:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
02:58:02.929 --> 02:58:02.939 align:start position:0%
question can you tell me I'm separate
 
02:58:05.150 --> 02:58:05.160 align:start position:0%
from warnings or like the issuing of a
 
02:58:08.750 --> 02:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
ticket is there documentation of every
 
02:58:11.809 --> 02:58:11.819 align:start position:0%
stop regardless of whether or not uh
 
02:58:14.210 --> 02:58:14.220 align:start position:0%
like a warning or you know if nothing if
 
02:58:16.250 --> 02:58:16.260 align:start position:0%
if I'm pulled over
 
02:58:18.290 --> 02:58:18.300 align:start position:0%
um and for whatever I don't wind up
 
02:58:21.469 --> 02:58:21.479 align:start position:0%
getting a warning or a ticket is there a
 
02:58:24.370 --> 02:58:24.380 align:start position:0%
record of me being pulled over and if so
 
02:58:27.710 --> 02:58:27.720 align:start position:0%
is there documentation as to the the
 
02:58:30.530 --> 02:58:30.540 align:start position:0%
um you know the race and and
 
02:58:30.540 --> 02:58:32.090 align:start position:0%
um you know the race and and
Etc

02:58:32.090 --> 02:58:32.100 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
02:58:34.490 --> 02:58:34.500 align:start position:0%
if there's no summons issued and there's
 
02:58:36.050 --> 02:58:36.060 align:start position:0%
no written warning issue there still is
 
02:58:38.269 --> 02:58:38.279 align:start position:0%
a record of the motor vehicle stop uh in
 
02:58:40.610 --> 02:58:40.620 align:start position:0%
the Department's computer-rated dispatch
 
02:58:45.349 --> 02:58:45.359 align:start position:0%
system that would include the data that
 
02:58:46.969 --> 02:58:46.979 align:start position:0%
is included on your motor vehicle
 
02:58:49.490 --> 02:58:49.500 align:start position:0%
operator's license right so that would
 
02:58:51.469 --> 02:58:51.479 align:start position:0%
be the data that would be reflected in
 
02:58:53.090 --> 02:58:53.100 align:start position:0%
that particular case
 
02:58:55.450 --> 02:58:55.460 align:start position:0%
and of course uh
 
02:58:58.130 --> 02:58:58.140 align:start position:0%
individuals are not required to submit
 
02:59:00.290 --> 02:59:00.300 align:start position:0%
data with respect to race and ethnicity
 
02:59:02.929 --> 02:59:02.939 align:start position:0%
on their driver's license and that's
 
02:59:06.410 --> 02:59:06.420 align:start position:0%
where the problem of subjectivity comes
 
02:59:08.410 --> 02:59:08.420 align:start position:0%
into play right without
 
02:59:11.469 --> 02:59:11.479 align:start position:0%
self-identification in many many cases
 
02:59:14.269 --> 02:59:14.279 align:start position:0%
officers guess and when they're not
 
02:59:17.330 --> 02:59:17.340 align:start position:0%
certain right they're they're simply
 
02:59:19.250 --> 02:59:19.260 align:start position:0%
going to place unknown
 
02:59:22.250 --> 02:59:22.260 align:start position:0%
right and so that's typically what
 
02:59:27.230 --> 02:59:27.240 align:start position:0%
occurs when an officer is not able to uh
 
02:59:30.889 --> 02:59:30.899 align:start position:0%
factually discern with ease the race and
 
02:59:32.929 --> 02:59:32.939 align:start position:0%
ethnicity of an individual it's listed
 
02:59:35.990 --> 02:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
in the database as unknown right so
 
02:59:38.150 --> 02:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
that's that's where we come into the
 
02:59:43.190 --> 02:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:46.190 --> 02:59:46.200 align:start position:0%
thank you but if I just want to clarify
 
02:59:48.950 --> 02:59:48.960 align:start position:0%
so I understand so on um in the instance
 
02:59:50.809 --> 02:59:50.819 align:start position:0%
where I was we've pulled over and not
 
02:59:53.210 --> 02:59:53.220 align:start position:0%
given a ticket or a warning and the the
 
02:59:55.429 --> 02:59:55.439 align:start position:0%
there is a record made with the whatever
 
02:59:57.050 --> 02:59:57.060 align:start position:0%
information is on my driver's license
 
03:00:00.110 --> 03:00:00.120 align:start position:0%
there is no as as there's no race
 
03:00:02.750 --> 03:00:02.760 align:start position:0%
designation on my license that's not
 
03:00:06.469 --> 03:00:06.479 align:start position:0%
part of the the the record correct okay
 
03:00:10.010 --> 03:00:10.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:11.750 --> 03:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
03:00:20.870 --> 03:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:23.510 --> 03:00:23.520 align:start position:0%

03:00:33.710 --> 03:00:33.720 align:start position:0%
I was going to say good morning but I
 
03:00:35.090 --> 03:00:35.100 align:start position:0%
guess it's good afternoon I think we
 
03:00:37.849 --> 03:00:37.859 align:start position:0%
just went over the notch there into the
 
03:00:41.330 --> 03:00:41.340 align:start position:0%
noon so my name is Mark Bodwin I am a
 
03:00:42.830 --> 03:00:42.840 align:start position:0%
retired sergeant from the New Hampshire
 
03:00:46.490 --> 03:00:46.500 align:start position:0%
State Police and I'm here to speak in
 
03:00:49.429 --> 03:00:49.439 align:start position:0%
opposition to uh this bill uh and just
 
03:00:52.130 --> 03:00:52.140 align:start position:0%
so uh for the beginning of this
 
03:00:54.950 --> 03:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
um we're not opposed to the idea of the
 
03:00:56.809 --> 03:00:56.819 align:start position:0%
bill which is what reporting misconduct
 
03:00:58.849 --> 03:00:58.859 align:start position:0%
to uh you know supervisors that you
 
03:01:01.429 --> 03:01:01.439 align:start position:0%
might see a fellow police officers the
 
03:01:03.769 --> 03:01:03.779 align:start position:0%
only issue we have with the bill is and
 
03:01:05.750 --> 03:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
I think we've talked a little bit about
 
03:01:08.389 --> 03:01:08.399 align:start position:0%
it here before is where it says a
 
03:01:10.969 --> 03:01:10.979 align:start position:0%
misrepresentation of a material fact and
 
03:01:12.190 --> 03:01:12.200 align:start position:0%
a police report
 
03:01:14.330 --> 03:01:14.340 align:start position:0%
it's our belief that the word
 
03:01:16.190 --> 03:01:16.200 align:start position:0%
intentional should be in front of
 
03:01:18.889 --> 03:01:18.899 align:start position:0%
misrepresentation because if I put
 
03:01:20.870 --> 03:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
something into a police report that I
 
03:01:23.269 --> 03:01:23.279 align:start position:0%
misperceive something and it actually is
 
03:01:25.630 --> 03:01:25.640 align:start position:0%
incorrect but I didn't do it on purpose
 
03:01:27.650 --> 03:01:27.660 align:start position:0%
we don't want to hold that police
 
03:01:29.929 --> 03:01:29.939 align:start position:0%
officer accountable for that honest
 
03:01:29.939 --> 03:01:31.730 align:start position:0%
officer accountable for that honest
mistake

03:01:31.730 --> 03:01:31.740 align:start position:0%
mistake
 
03:01:33.590 --> 03:01:33.600 align:start position:0%
um and the same thing for I think with
 
03:01:35.510 --> 03:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
the misidentification of race I think
 
03:01:38.030 --> 03:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
that that has to be an intentional
 
03:01:40.910 --> 03:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
misrepresentation as well uh because I
 
03:01:42.950 --> 03:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
think uh you know you've tried to parse
 
03:01:44.150 --> 03:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
that out a little bit here with the
 
03:01:47.150 --> 03:01:47.160 align:start position:0%
prior Witnesses but again you know a lot
 
03:01:49.969 --> 03:01:49.979 align:start position:0%
of uh these uh are now going to more
 
03:01:52.070 --> 03:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
computerized uh warnings when I first
 
03:01:54.650 --> 03:01:54.660 align:start position:0%
started it was handwritten and there
 
03:01:56.450 --> 03:01:56.460 align:start position:0%
wasn't any place in super State Police
 
03:01:57.950 --> 03:01:57.960 align:start position:0%
anywhere to put you know what the race
 
03:02:00.190 --> 03:02:00.200 align:start position:0%
of the person was on the handwritten um
 
03:02:03.889 --> 03:02:03.899 align:start position:0%
uh warnings uh now it's all computerized
 
03:02:06.530 --> 03:02:06.540 align:start position:0%
and with computerized they try to make
 
03:02:08.269 --> 03:02:08.279 align:start position:0%
it easy for you which includes drop down
 
03:02:11.570 --> 03:02:11.580 align:start position:0%
menus and if you accidentally select the
 
03:02:13.490 --> 03:02:13.500 align:start position:0%
wrong one and you didn't notice it and
 
03:02:15.650 --> 03:02:15.660 align:start position:0%
you kept going to the next box we don't
 
03:02:17.690 --> 03:02:17.700 align:start position:0%
want to hold a a police officer or at
 
03:02:19.309 --> 03:02:19.319 align:start position:0%
least I don't think you want to hold a
 
03:02:22.730 --> 03:02:22.740 align:start position:0%
police officer accountable for that but
 
03:02:23.690 --> 03:02:23.700 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day what you're
 
03:02:25.670 --> 03:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
looking to do is you're looking for
 
03:02:27.469 --> 03:02:27.479 align:start position:0%
those officers to report these
 
03:02:29.570 --> 03:02:29.580 align:start position:0%
intentional infractions that they see
 
03:02:31.790 --> 03:02:31.800 align:start position:0%
their fellow officers doing to their
 
03:02:33.769 --> 03:02:33.779 align:start position:0%
supervisors and then I think that
 
03:02:35.809 --> 03:02:35.819 align:start position:0%
there's also other statues as you heard
 
03:02:38.090 --> 03:02:38.100 align:start position:0%
the chief speak to that can play a role
 
03:02:40.610 --> 03:02:40.620 align:start position:0%
behind the scenes afterwards to also
 
03:02:43.790 --> 03:02:43.800 align:start position:0%
include 106 L colon 2 which is the
 
03:02:46.490 --> 03:02:46.500 align:start position:0%
misconduct uh uh with the police stands
 
03:02:48.349 --> 03:02:48.359 align:start position:0%
and training Council where you're
 
03:02:49.969 --> 03:02:49.979 align:start position:0%
brought in front of them for your
 
03:02:52.010 --> 03:02:52.020 align:start position:0%
certification status
 
03:02:54.110 --> 03:02:54.120 align:start position:0%
uh so with that I want to keep it brief
 
03:02:56.330 --> 03:02:56.340 align:start position:0%
so our only concern was the words
 
03:02:57.950 --> 03:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
intentional in front of both of those
 
03:02:59.809 --> 03:02:59.819 align:start position:0%
sections and with that I'd be happy to
 
03:03:02.269 --> 03:03:02.279 align:start position:0%
take any questions you might have
 
03:03:04.010 --> 03:03:04.020 align:start position:0%
representative Rhodes
 
03:03:05.570 --> 03:03:05.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
03:03:09.290 --> 03:03:09.300 align:start position:0%
taking my question if if an officer was
 
03:03:10.610 --> 03:03:10.620 align:start position:0%
made aware
 
03:03:14.090 --> 03:03:14.100 align:start position:0%
that the wrong waste was was put on the
 
03:03:15.410 --> 03:03:15.420 align:start position:0%
person comes in front of you and you can
 
03:03:17.389 --> 03:03:17.399 align:start position:0%
clearly see that would it be corrected
 
03:03:20.269 --> 03:03:20.279 align:start position:0%
and would it be noted yes
 
03:03:23.990 --> 03:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:25.910 --> 03:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
03:03:29.570 --> 03:03:29.580 align:start position:0%
have a good afternoon you as well
 
03:03:37.610 --> 03:03:37.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:39.050 --> 03:03:39.060 align:start position:0%
feel as though I'm at a disadvantage
 
03:03:41.410 --> 03:03:41.420 align:start position:0%
anytime I'm testifying afternoon
 
03:03:44.210 --> 03:03:44.220 align:start position:0%
so I will keep this very brief my name
 
03:03:47.269 --> 03:03:47.279 align:start position:0%
is Joe Ebert it's e-b-e-r-t I am a major
 
03:03:48.710 --> 03:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
with the state police overseeing the
 
03:03:51.530 --> 03:03:51.540 align:start position:0%
Investigative Services Bureau Chief
 
03:03:53.990 --> 03:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
profansky retired Sergeant potum brought
 
03:03:56.330 --> 03:03:56.340 align:start position:0%
up the same issues that I was going to
 
03:03:57.830 --> 03:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
address with the committee so I will
 
03:04:00.530 --> 03:04:00.540 align:start position:0%
keep this very brief but it I think the
 
03:04:03.469 --> 03:04:03.479 align:start position:0%
the bill itself very well intentioned uh
 
03:04:05.150 --> 03:04:05.160 align:start position:0%
in speaking with representative Muse is
 
03:04:07.670 --> 03:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
no doubt in my mind that he is looking
 
03:04:10.130 --> 03:04:10.140 align:start position:0%
to address an issue that he sees and
 
03:04:11.570 --> 03:04:11.580 align:start position:0%
he's looking to do that with the best
 
03:04:14.690 --> 03:04:14.700 align:start position:0%
intentions in mind uh the concern I had
 
03:04:17.389 --> 03:04:17.399 align:start position:0%
was the term demonstrable I did I like
 
03:04:19.010 --> 03:04:19.020 align:start position:0%
the representative I looked that up it's
 
03:04:21.349 --> 03:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
not a term that we typically see in
 
03:04:24.710 --> 03:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
legal jargon so clearly apparent or
 
03:04:27.769 --> 03:04:27.779 align:start position:0%
capable of being logically proved and my
 
03:04:30.230 --> 03:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
concern with that is uh if you look at a
 
03:04:32.389 --> 03:04:32.399 align:start position:0%
report in which somebody does select the
 
03:04:34.730 --> 03:04:34.740 align:start position:0%
wrong drop down uh is it clearly
 
03:04:37.429 --> 03:04:37.439 align:start position:0%
apparent it is clearly apparent is it
 
03:04:39.830 --> 03:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
readily provable absolutely you can
 
03:04:41.809 --> 03:04:41.819 align:start position:0%
prove that the person chose that because
 
03:04:45.110 --> 03:04:45.120 align:start position:0%
you can see that they filed that report
 
03:04:47.090 --> 03:04:47.100 align:start position:0%
so I think that sets up a scenario where
 
03:04:48.950 --> 03:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
that's an administrative error that
 
03:04:51.050 --> 03:04:51.060 align:start position:0%
should be dealt with and internally in
 
03:04:53.450 --> 03:04:53.460 align:start position:0%
that police department and it is on a
 
03:04:55.370 --> 03:04:55.380 align:start position:0%
regular basis we deal with our Troopers
 
03:04:57.050 --> 03:04:57.060 align:start position:0%
and we say Hey listen we've reviewed
 
03:04:59.809 --> 03:04:59.819 align:start position:0%
your report we see that you have made an
 
03:05:01.849 --> 03:05:01.859 align:start position:0%
error in that report you need to be more
 
03:05:04.010 --> 03:05:04.020 align:start position:0%
keenly aware of what it is that you're
 
03:05:04.020 --> 03:05:05.389 align:start position:0%
keenly aware of what it is that you're
doing

03:05:05.389 --> 03:05:05.399 align:start position:0%
doing
 
03:05:08.450 --> 03:05:08.460 align:start position:0%
having said that I think that changing
 
03:05:11.450 --> 03:05:11.460 align:start position:0%
if the committee were open to the uh the
 
03:05:15.110 --> 03:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
possibility of changing this uh this RSA
 
03:05:17.210 --> 03:05:17.220 align:start position:0%
or this bill to read intentional
 
03:05:19.429 --> 03:05:19.439 align:start position:0%
misrepresentation of a fact in a police
 
03:05:19.439 --> 03:05:20.389 align:start position:0%
misrepresentation of a fact in a police
report

03:05:20.389 --> 03:05:20.399 align:start position:0%
report
 
03:05:23.090 --> 03:05:23.100 align:start position:0%
there's no doubt in our mind that
 
03:05:26.030 --> 03:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
intentionally uh misrepresenting a fact
 
03:05:28.910 --> 03:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
in a police report is misconduct that's
 
03:05:30.410 --> 03:05:30.420 align:start position:0%
not something we would tolerate I think
 
03:05:32.809 --> 03:05:32.819 align:start position:0%
the chief addressed that that is already
 
03:05:36.530 --> 03:05:36.540 align:start position:0%
in statute as a a prosecutable crime and
 
03:05:38.530 --> 03:05:38.540 align:start position:0%
we wanted to come out in
 
03:05:40.969 --> 03:05:40.979 align:start position:0%
significant support of that notion and
 
03:05:43.550 --> 03:05:43.560 align:start position:0%
we didn't want to leave I left on my uh
 
03:05:47.870 --> 03:05:47.880 align:start position:0%
my card I left it as no position no
 
03:05:49.610 --> 03:05:49.620 align:start position:0%
position because I did not want to come
 
03:05:53.030 --> 03:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
in an opposition to a bill such as this
 
03:05:55.490 --> 03:05:55.500 align:start position:0%
where I know it's very very very well
 
03:05:57.950 --> 03:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
intentioned but we would have trouble
 
03:06:00.889 --> 03:06:00.899 align:start position:0%
supporting it we're not uh word to move
 
03:06:02.330 --> 03:06:02.340 align:start position:0%
forward with the demonstrable
 
03:06:04.849 --> 03:06:04.859 align:start position:0%
terminology in there as it relates to
 
03:06:06.710 --> 03:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
the race and ethnicity
 
03:06:08.450 --> 03:06:08.460 align:start position:0%
I think that that was addressed by the
 
03:06:11.750 --> 03:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
the chief I think that is likely best
 
03:06:15.650 --> 03:06:15.660 align:start position:0%
left uh not identified in this
 
03:06:18.710 --> 03:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
particular Bill until the credentialing
 
03:06:20.330 --> 03:06:20.340 align:start position:0%
of race is determined whether it's in
 
03:06:22.130 --> 03:06:22.140 align:start position:0%
this committee or by the legislative
 
03:06:23.530 --> 03:06:23.540 align:start position:0%
body as a whole
 
03:06:26.330 --> 03:06:26.340 align:start position:0%
but again I think it's covered by the
 
03:06:28.010 --> 03:06:28.020 align:start position:0%
notion that if you intentionally
 
03:06:30.889 --> 03:06:30.899 align:start position:0%
misrepresent a fact in a police report
 
03:06:33.530 --> 03:06:33.540 align:start position:0%
that covers uh the race and ethnicity of
 
03:06:35.210 --> 03:06:35.220 align:start position:0%
that person as well
 
03:06:36.590 --> 03:06:36.600 align:start position:0%
with that I'm happy to answer any
 
03:06:36.600 --> 03:06:38.389 align:start position:0%
with that I'm happy to answer any
questions

03:06:38.389 --> 03:06:38.399 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:06:40.610 --> 03:06:40.620 align:start position:0%
representative Newell
 
03:06:42.050 --> 03:06:42.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
03:06:44.389 --> 03:06:44.399 align:start position:0%
taking my question I just am wondering
 
03:06:46.130 --> 03:06:46.140 align:start position:0%
we're talking about like a clerical
 
03:06:48.349 --> 03:06:48.359 align:start position:0%
error right a drop down menu has that
 
03:06:51.469 --> 03:06:51.479 align:start position:0%
example has been used and I'm I'm hoping
 
03:06:52.670 --> 03:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
this is just because I haven't gotten a
 
03:06:53.990 --> 03:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
ticket in a while but I don't remember
 
03:06:56.510 --> 03:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
those uh a ticket that's being written
 
03:06:57.889 --> 03:06:57.899 align:start position:0%
on the spot is actually being written
 
03:06:59.929 --> 03:06:59.939 align:start position:0%
not entered into a computer am I right
 
03:07:02.269 --> 03:07:02.279 align:start position:0%
or am I have I just has it been a while
 
03:07:04.190 --> 03:07:04.200 align:start position:0%
I thank you very much for the question
 
03:07:07.969 --> 03:07:07.979 align:start position:0%
and uh congratulations on uh not making
 
03:07:09.889 --> 03:07:09.899 align:start position:0%
the acquaintance of Troopers lately uh
 
03:07:12.530 --> 03:07:12.540 align:start position:0%
so uh it has been a long time since I've
 
03:07:14.690 --> 03:07:14.700 align:start position:0%
written a summons uh but what I can tell
 
03:07:17.210 --> 03:07:17.220 align:start position:0%
you is that uh there is a change to a
 
03:07:19.610 --> 03:07:19.620 align:start position:0%
computerized system where uh the the
 
03:07:21.650 --> 03:07:21.660 align:start position:0%
license is actually scanned at this
 
03:07:24.769 --> 03:07:24.779 align:start position:0%
point the information populates in a uh
 
03:07:26.150 --> 03:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
a summons is printed with that
 
03:07:28.490 --> 03:07:28.500 align:start position:0%
information that comes from the scanned
 
03:07:31.070 --> 03:07:31.080 align:start position:0%
license so are there still departments
 
03:07:33.349 --> 03:07:33.359 align:start position:0%
that are handwriting the information in
 
03:07:36.710 --> 03:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
yes there are but I know for the vast
 
03:07:38.809 --> 03:07:38.819 align:start position:0%
majority of Troopers that is done in a
 
03:07:41.690 --> 03:07:41.700 align:start position:0%
computerized mechanism
 
03:07:44.269 --> 03:07:44.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:07:47.210 --> 03:07:47.220 align:start position:0%
representative Newman
 
03:07:49.969 --> 03:07:49.979 align:start position:0%
I I just have a question about the RSA
 
03:07:52.190 --> 03:07:52.200 align:start position:0%
and the intention of the RSA I think
 
03:07:53.809 --> 03:07:53.819 align:start position:0%
we're spending a lot of time on the
 
03:07:55.550 --> 03:07:55.560 align:start position:0%
first section that that changes the
 
03:07:56.870 --> 03:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
definition and tries to Define
 
03:07:56.880 --> 03:07:58.910 align:start position:0%
definition and tries to Define
misconduct

03:07:58.910 --> 03:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
misconduct
 
03:08:01.010 --> 03:08:01.020 align:start position:0%
and we might be ignoring the rest of the
 
03:08:03.889 --> 03:08:03.899 align:start position:0%
bill and and it's in the section that it
 
03:08:05.510 --> 03:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
says reports of misconduct by law
 
03:08:07.429 --> 03:08:07.439 align:start position:0%
enforcement offices and and I'll just
 
03:08:08.630 --> 03:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
read the first sentence of section
 
03:08:11.210 --> 03:08:11.220 align:start position:0%
number two it says it shall be the duty
 
03:08:12.710 --> 03:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
of any law enforcement officer who
 
03:08:15.170 --> 03:08:15.180 align:start position:0%
observes misconduct by any uh by another
 
03:08:18.469 --> 03:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officer to notify notify
 
03:08:20.389 --> 03:08:20.399 align:start position:0%
the chief law enforcement enforcement
 
03:08:22.429 --> 03:08:22.439 align:start position:0%
officer of his or her Department in
 
03:08:24.769 --> 03:08:24.779 align:start position:0%
writing immediately or as soon as
 
03:08:27.950 --> 03:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
practical will after observing such
 
03:08:29.990 --> 03:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
misconduct then the rest of the law
 
03:08:32.269 --> 03:08:32.279 align:start position:0%
talks about what happens after that
 
03:08:36.230 --> 03:08:36.240 align:start position:0%
so I think that even if the definition
 
03:08:39.230 --> 03:08:39.240 align:start position:0%
is not quite understood if the person
 
03:08:41.210 --> 03:08:41.220 align:start position:0%
perceives to have seen misconduct I
 
03:08:42.349 --> 03:08:42.359 align:start position:0%
think this law is just trying to get
 
03:08:45.950 --> 03:08:45.960 align:start position:0%
people to report that misconduct within
 
03:08:47.570 --> 03:08:47.580 align:start position:0%
their Department without any penalty
 
03:08:50.389 --> 03:08:50.399 align:start position:0%
it's civil so I'm I'm not sure that
 
03:08:51.769 --> 03:08:51.779 align:start position:0%
we're approaching this from the right
 
03:08:53.510 --> 03:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
direction and if you have any comment
 
03:08:57.170 --> 03:08:57.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:01.309 --> 03:09:01.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:03.230 --> 03:09:03.240 align:start position:0%
so I wanted to take a second to collect
 
03:09:04.429 --> 03:09:04.439 align:start position:0%
my thoughts there because I want to make
 
03:09:06.650 --> 03:09:06.660 align:start position:0%
sure that I address this in the uh uh in
 
03:09:09.349 --> 03:09:09.359 align:start position:0%
the best possible way uh
 
03:09:11.210 --> 03:09:11.220 align:start position:0%
I think by
 
03:09:12.830 --> 03:09:12.840 align:start position:0%
I don't think this was your intention
 
03:09:15.530 --> 03:09:15.540 align:start position:0%
but by saying that this was uh this is a
 
03:09:17.870 --> 03:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
civil process that it's just a review
 
03:09:21.530 --> 03:09:21.540 align:start position:0%
process I think that's downplaying uh
 
03:09:23.929 --> 03:09:23.939 align:start position:0%
what is being alleged in a misconduct
 
03:09:27.769 --> 03:09:27.779 align:start position:0%
allegation so I I don't think that any
 
03:09:29.210 --> 03:09:29.220 align:start position:0%
allegation of misconduct it was
 
03:09:30.710 --> 03:09:30.720 align:start position:0%
discussed earlier that well there is a
 
03:09:32.870 --> 03:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
remedy by which you go through a process
 
03:09:34.910 --> 03:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
and you would be able to say uh listen
 
03:09:37.010 --> 03:09:37.020 align:start position:0%
this was an honest mistake and maybe
 
03:09:40.730 --> 03:09:40.740 align:start position:0%
that's borne out and uh the the hearing
 
03:09:41.990 --> 03:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
is found that
 
03:09:43.790 --> 03:09:43.800 align:start position:0%
um you know you didn't intentionally do
 
03:09:46.429 --> 03:09:46.439 align:start position:0%
something I would submit to you that
 
03:09:48.590 --> 03:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
going through that process for what
 
03:09:50.889 --> 03:09:50.899 align:start position:0%
could be a clerical error
 
03:09:54.950 --> 03:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
or uh anything other than intentionally
 
03:09:59.269 --> 03:09:59.279 align:start position:0%
done would be I think a detriment to the
 
03:10:02.150 --> 03:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
morale of law enforcement we want to
 
03:10:04.190 --> 03:10:04.200 align:start position:0%
hold law enforcement absolutely
 
03:10:06.050 --> 03:10:06.060 align:start position:0%
accountable for actions that they're
 
03:10:07.670 --> 03:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
intentionally doing
 
03:10:09.830 --> 03:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
for actions that are them being human
 
03:10:12.830 --> 03:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
beings that should be in in our opinion
 
03:10:14.330 --> 03:10:14.340 align:start position:0%
that should be dealt with within the
 
03:10:16.910 --> 03:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
agency that they work for
 
03:10:19.910 --> 03:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:21.769 --> 03:10:21.779 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
03:10:23.570 --> 03:10:23.580 align:start position:0%
very much
 
03:10:25.309 --> 03:10:25.319 align:start position:0%
anyone else wishing to testify who has
 
03:10:27.050 --> 03:10:27.060 align:start position:0%
not submitted a pink card
 
03:10:28.730 --> 03:10:28.740 align:start position:0%

anyone
 
03:10:47.450 --> 03:10:47.460 align:start position:0%
okay represent Pratt will do it for
 
03:11:00.070 --> 03:11:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:02.630 --> 03:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:11:05.690 --> 03:11:05.700 align:start position:0%
representative Troy here is a not only a
 
03:11:06.830 --> 03:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
representative but he's also a police
 
03:11:08.990 --> 03:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
officer he's in court today so I'm going
 
03:11:11.030 --> 03:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
to present his bill I have some
 
03:11:12.530 --> 03:11:12.540 align:start position:0%
knowledge on it but not complete
 
03:11:12.540 --> 03:11:13.370 align:start position:0%
knowledge on it but not complete
knowledge

03:11:13.370 --> 03:11:13.380 align:start position:0%
knowledge
 
03:11:15.050 --> 03:11:15.060 align:start position:0%
but I do know those people behind us
 
03:11:17.269 --> 03:11:17.279 align:start position:0%
that represent uh Elijah communication
 
03:11:18.590 --> 03:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
centers in the state that will have a
 
03:11:20.570 --> 03:11:20.580 align:start position:0%
lot more information for us
 
03:11:23.870 --> 03:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
so this bill is a um establishes a
 
03:11:25.610 --> 03:11:25.620 align:start position:0%
committee and they study the current
 
03:11:27.590 --> 03:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
education training requirements for
 
03:11:28.849 --> 03:11:28.859 align:start position:0%
personnel employed as emergency
 
03:11:31.490 --> 03:11:31.500 align:start position:0%
dispatches 9-1-1 telecommunicators for
 
03:11:33.650 --> 03:11:33.660 align:start position:0%
police via an emergency medical
 
03:11:33.660 --> 03:11:37.190 align:start position:0%
police via an emergency medical
organizations

03:11:37.190 --> 03:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:40.250 --> 03:11:40.260 align:start position:0%
lines three through ten is a makeup of
 
03:11:41.870 --> 03:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
the membership of the committee
 
03:11:44.570 --> 03:11:44.580 align:start position:0%
you can read that and then lines 11
 
03:11:46.910 --> 03:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
through 20 is a committee's duties and
 
03:11:47.870 --> 03:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
what they're going to be doing when
 
03:11:49.190 --> 03:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
they're put together
 
03:11:51.530 --> 03:11:51.540 align:start position:0%
and they have to start within 45 days
 
03:11:54.650 --> 03:11:54.660 align:start position:0%
and at the end they have to report so
 
03:11:57.650 --> 03:11:57.660 align:start position:0%
lines 21-24 they're going to report to
 
03:11:59.750 --> 03:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
the speaker of the house before November
 
03:12:03.889 --> 03:12:03.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:05.389 --> 03:12:05.399 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
03:12:08.030 --> 03:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
can you tell us the impetus for this
 
03:12:09.830 --> 03:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
bill what
 
03:12:12.830 --> 03:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
um this is brought forth by um he's a
 
03:12:15.170 --> 03:12:15.180 align:start position:0%
police officer and the other fellow is
 
03:12:18.710 --> 03:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
also in emergency services and
 
03:12:20.750 --> 03:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
basically across the state of New
 
03:12:22.910 --> 03:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the training of dispatches and
 
03:12:24.590 --> 03:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
Communications people is different in
 
03:12:27.050 --> 03:12:27.060 align:start position:0%
almost every community of every dispatch
 
03:12:30.170 --> 03:12:30.180 align:start position:0%
area there is some things like Power
 
03:12:32.090 --> 03:12:32.100 align:start position:0%
phone that is a training organization
 
03:12:33.650 --> 03:12:33.660 align:start position:0%
that most of them use but not all of
 
03:12:36.230 --> 03:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
them so it's kind of looking at all the
 
03:12:38.030 --> 03:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
training that all these people use to
 
03:12:40.330 --> 03:12:40.340 align:start position:0%
see if there's some way of having a
 
03:12:42.769 --> 03:12:42.779 align:start position:0%
standardized type of training that all
 
03:12:44.150 --> 03:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
of them would be using the same thing
 
03:12:46.130 --> 03:12:46.140 align:start position:0%
and to see what level training
 
03:12:47.889 --> 03:12:47.899 align:start position:0%
everybody's doing and of course the
 
03:12:49.849 --> 03:12:49.859 align:start position:0%
communications difference for police
 
03:12:52.250 --> 03:12:52.260 align:start position:0%
fire and ambulance service so there's
 
03:12:55.010 --> 03:12:55.020 align:start position:0%
medical trainings some dispatches get
 
03:12:56.809 --> 03:12:56.819 align:start position:0%
medical training and do medical uh over
 
03:12:57.769 --> 03:12:57.779 align:start position:0%
the phone
 
03:13:00.410 --> 03:13:00.420 align:start position:0%
some don't so so I think they're trying
 
03:13:02.889 --> 03:13:02.899 align:start position:0%
to find some uniformity or some
 
03:13:05.690 --> 03:13:05.700 align:start position:0%
standard the policemen the firemen they
 
03:13:07.130 --> 03:13:07.140 align:start position:0%
have standardized training so the state
 
03:13:09.050 --> 03:13:09.060 align:start position:0%
through the state of New Hampshire
 
03:13:12.349 --> 03:13:12.359 align:start position:0%
but dispatching Communications is kind
 
03:13:13.790 --> 03:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
of open right now
 
03:13:17.630 --> 03:13:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:20.389 --> 03:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
representative Newell
 
03:13:22.190 --> 03:13:22.200 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm wondering if oh thank you I'm
 
03:13:23.570 --> 03:13:23.580 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:13:25.550 --> 03:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I'm wondering if
 
03:13:27.530 --> 03:13:27.540 align:start position:0%
there is a concern with the current
 
03:13:30.110 --> 03:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
standard or what what is the status of
 
03:13:31.969 --> 03:13:31.979 align:start position:0%
the standards that we have now
 
03:13:34.130 --> 03:13:34.140 align:start position:0%
I think most of the communications do a
 
03:13:35.510 --> 03:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
great job it's just a little bit
 
03:13:36.950 --> 03:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
different and I think they may be
 
03:13:38.870 --> 03:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
looking for a certification or maybe
 
03:13:41.030 --> 03:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
looking for a standardization in the
 
03:13:43.010 --> 03:13:43.020 align:start position:0%
training that you get okay so just to
 
03:13:45.590 --> 03:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
clarify currently there is not a a
 
03:13:48.170 --> 03:13:48.180 align:start position:0%
standard for that is for the entire
 
03:13:49.790 --> 03:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
State what we're trying to do is just
 
03:13:51.230 --> 03:13:51.240 align:start position:0%
make sure that we have uniformity
 
03:13:53.990 --> 03:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
correct okay thanks yeah uh police and
 
03:13:55.730 --> 03:13:55.740 align:start position:0%
fire they have their standards through
 
03:13:57.769 --> 03:13:57.779 align:start position:0%
the both of the academies and dispatch
 
03:14:00.650 --> 03:14:00.660 align:start position:0%
doesn't even have an academy so it's a
 
03:14:03.050 --> 03:14:03.060 align:start position:0%
if you take makers thank you for your
 
03:14:03.060 --> 03:14:06.050 align:start position:0%
if you take makers thank you for your
testimony

03:14:06.050 --> 03:14:06.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:07.670 --> 03:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry did you want to ask him a
 
03:14:09.070 --> 03:14:09.080 align:start position:0%
question I'm sorry

as anyone here who has to testify who
 
03:14:24.410 --> 03:14:24.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:25.910 --> 03:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
if you want to testify you have to pull
 
03:14:27.590 --> 03:14:27.600 align:start position:0%

opportunity to speak with you
 
03:15:14.570 --> 03:15:14.580 align:start position:0%
briefly I hope this afternoon to talk a
 
03:15:17.389 --> 03:15:17.399 align:start position:0%
little bit about the bill which is in
 
03:15:20.269 --> 03:15:20.279 align:start position:0%
front of you to establish a committee to
 
03:15:22.070 --> 03:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
study the standards and training and
 
03:15:24.110 --> 03:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
certifications at all associated with
 
03:15:25.670 --> 03:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
Public Safety dispatchers and
 
03:15:27.590 --> 03:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
telecommunicators across the state it
 
03:15:30.110 --> 03:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
was already alluded to that there's a
 
03:15:33.110 --> 03:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
lack of consistency when it comes to
 
03:15:33.120 --> 03:15:33.889 align:start position:0%
lack of consistency when it comes to
um

03:15:33.889 --> 03:15:33.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:15:37.130 --> 03:15:37.140 align:start position:0%
acceptable and mandatory trainings and
 
03:15:39.050 --> 03:15:39.060 align:start position:0%
certifications for a public safety
 
03:15:41.809 --> 03:15:41.819 align:start position:0%
dispatch Communications Personnel I've
 
03:15:43.429 --> 03:15:43.439 align:start position:0%
been in the public safety field going on
 
03:15:45.469 --> 03:15:45.479 align:start position:0%
39 years now both as a police chief in
 
03:15:46.750 --> 03:15:46.760 align:start position:0%
the law enforcement side of the house
 
03:15:49.610 --> 03:15:49.620 align:start position:0%
and as well as my current position as
 
03:15:50.630 --> 03:15:50.640 align:start position:0%
the Director of the division of
 
03:15:51.950 --> 03:15:51.960 align:start position:0%
emergency services and Communications
 
03:15:53.210 --> 03:15:53.220 align:start position:0%
here with the New Hampshire Department
 
03:15:55.610 --> 03:15:55.620 align:start position:0%
of Safety in my current role I oversee
 
03:15:57.889 --> 03:15:57.899 align:start position:0%
the 9-1-1 system in the state of New
 
03:15:57.899 --> 03:15:59.570 align:start position:0%
the 9-1-1 system in the state of New
Hampshire

03:15:59.570 --> 03:15:59.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:16:02.690 --> 03:16:02.700 align:start position:0%
having worked in that role currently and
 
03:16:04.550 --> 03:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
in my previous life I've had the
 
03:16:07.490 --> 03:16:07.500 align:start position:0%
opportunity to see an evolution of
 
03:16:08.510 --> 03:16:08.520 align:start position:0%
training when it comes to
 
03:16:12.290 --> 03:16:12.300 align:start position:0%
standardization in both the Fire EMS and
 
03:16:13.910 --> 03:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
as well as the law enforcement worlds
 
03:16:16.010 --> 03:16:16.020 align:start position:0%
and that continues there's a number of
 
03:16:18.230 --> 03:16:18.240 align:start position:0%
standards that law enforcement officers
 
03:16:19.849 --> 03:16:19.859 align:start position:0%
that fire service Personnel Emergency
 
03:16:21.769 --> 03:16:21.779 align:start position:0%
Medical Services Personnel have to
 
03:16:23.630 --> 03:16:23.640 align:start position:0%
continually meet to maintain their
 
03:16:25.790 --> 03:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
certifications and credentials as well
 
03:16:27.349 --> 03:16:27.359 align:start position:0%
as to get their foot in the door to
 
03:16:29.210 --> 03:16:29.220 align:start position:0%
become certified in those respective
 
03:16:30.410 --> 03:16:30.420 align:start position:0%
professions and that's what we're
 
03:16:33.110 --> 03:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
talking about today our personnel as
 
03:16:34.790 --> 03:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
Public Safety dispatchers and Public
 
03:16:37.190 --> 03:16:37.200 align:start position:0%
Safety telecommunicators are no
 
03:16:38.269 --> 03:16:38.279 align:start position:0%
different when it comes to the
 
03:16:40.309 --> 03:16:40.319 align:start position:0%
profession that they represent and in
 
03:16:42.110 --> 03:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
terms of that profession we need to make
 
03:16:45.590 --> 03:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
sure that they're as well trained and as
 
03:16:48.110 --> 03:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
well credentialed in many respects when
 
03:16:49.490 --> 03:16:49.500 align:start position:0%
it comes to the Life Safety Services
 
03:16:51.410 --> 03:16:51.420 align:start position:0%
that they render every single day of the
 
03:16:53.150 --> 03:16:53.160 align:start position:0%
week they are in many respects
 
03:16:55.010 --> 03:16:55.020 align:start position:0%
considered our first First Responders
 
03:16:57.130 --> 03:16:57.140 align:start position:0%
they're the first people that you handle
 
03:17:00.110 --> 03:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
with and communicate with and they
 
03:17:02.389 --> 03:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
conduct warm transfers to a publicity
 
03:17:04.010 --> 03:17:04.020 align:start position:0%
Public Safety communications center
 
03:17:05.630 --> 03:17:05.640 align:start position:0%
personnel which are located across the
 
03:17:08.210 --> 03:17:08.220 align:start position:0%
state who in turn make sure that that
 
03:17:09.889 --> 03:17:09.899 align:start position:0%
information that those services are
 
03:17:12.290 --> 03:17:12.300 align:start position:0%
rendered to our Public Safety First
 
03:17:13.969 --> 03:17:13.979 align:start position:0%
Responders in the field whether they're
 
03:17:17.030 --> 03:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
police fire or EMS Services Personnel to
 
03:17:19.090 --> 03:17:19.100 align:start position:0%
render safety when and where it's needed
 
03:17:21.410 --> 03:17:21.420 align:start position:0%
everyone in that Communications
 
03:17:24.230 --> 03:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
Continuum shares the same Mission it's
 
03:17:26.210 --> 03:17:26.220 align:start position:0%
to locate communicate connect people in
 
03:17:27.469 --> 03:17:27.479 align:start position:0%
an emergency with the help that they
 
03:17:29.510 --> 03:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
need when and where they need it and
 
03:17:31.070 --> 03:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
it's so critical to make sure that we're
 
03:17:32.929 --> 03:17:32.939 align:start position:0%
not skipping a beat and don't get me
 
03:17:34.849 --> 03:17:34.859 align:start position:0%
wrong when I say that there's a lack of
 
03:17:36.830 --> 03:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
standardization that equates to a lack
 
03:17:39.110 --> 03:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
of training that's not the case you will
 
03:17:40.790 --> 03:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
find should this bill pass as you
 
03:17:42.710 --> 03:17:42.720 align:start position:0%
conduct your research that the data you
 
03:17:43.910 --> 03:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
receive will show some marked
 
03:17:45.410 --> 03:17:45.420 align:start position:0%
differences in the level of training
 
03:17:47.090 --> 03:17:47.100 align:start position:0%
across the state depending upon a number
 
03:17:50.050 --> 03:17:50.060 align:start position:0%
of things of course cost time involved
 
03:17:52.429 --> 03:17:52.439 align:start position:0%
standards and requirements associated
 
03:17:54.290 --> 03:17:54.300 align:start position:0%
with those respective agencies that have
 
03:17:55.790 --> 03:17:55.800 align:start position:0%
different Scopes and responsibilities
 
03:17:57.590 --> 03:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
and I bring that up because you might be
 
03:17:58.670 --> 03:17:58.680 align:start position:0%
asking about what is that
 
03:18:00.830 --> 03:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
differentiation much of it has to do
 
03:18:01.969 --> 03:18:01.979 align:start position:0%
with the role and scope of the
 
03:18:03.590 --> 03:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the communications
 
03:18:06.469 --> 03:18:06.479 align:start position:0%
center that you as a person as a citizen
 
03:18:08.570 --> 03:18:08.580 align:start position:0%
as a resident or visitor to this state
 
03:18:11.030 --> 03:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
has to interact with or engage with I'll
 
03:18:12.410 --> 03:18:12.420 align:start position:0%
give you an example and I have
 
03:18:13.730 --> 03:18:13.740 align:start position:0%
colleagues behind me that will talk to
 
03:18:15.710 --> 03:18:15.720 align:start position:0%
their respective agencies and what they
 
03:18:19.490 --> 03:18:19.500 align:start position:0%
do at 9-1-1 we are a call reconciliation
 
03:18:21.469 --> 03:18:21.479 align:start position:0%
agency we are what we consider a
 
03:18:23.929 --> 03:18:23.939 align:start position:0%
transfer agency every 9-1-1 call that's
 
03:18:26.450 --> 03:18:26.460 align:start position:0%
initiated in this state or hits a cell
 
03:18:28.429 --> 03:18:28.439 align:start position:0%
tower in this state goes to our Public
 
03:18:30.410 --> 03:18:30.420 align:start position:0%
Safety answering point it does not go to
 
03:18:32.330 --> 03:18:32.340 align:start position:0%
your local Communication Center and a
 
03:18:34.130 --> 03:18:34.140 align:start position:0%
lot of folks don't realize that the
 
03:18:35.389 --> 03:18:35.399 align:start position:0%
person they're talking with is located
 
03:18:37.969 --> 03:18:37.979 align:start position:0%
in one of two locations here and those
 
03:18:40.510 --> 03:18:40.520 align:start position:0%
folks have standards that they must meet
 
03:18:43.269 --> 03:18:43.279 align:start position:0%
that are
 
03:18:45.530 --> 03:18:45.540 align:start position:0%
foundationally built into administrative
 
03:18:47.330 --> 03:18:47.340 align:start position:0%
rules so that when they come out of
 
03:18:49.010 --> 03:18:49.020 align:start position:0%
their training which can last up to 16
 
03:18:52.130 --> 03:18:52.140 align:start position:0%
weeks they all have that same level of
 
03:18:54.050 --> 03:18:54.060 align:start position:0%
training they all have that same level
 
03:18:55.849 --> 03:18:55.859 align:start position:0%
of credentialing and they have to
 
03:18:57.710 --> 03:18:57.720 align:start position:0%
maintain that training and certification
 
03:18:59.630 --> 03:18:59.640 align:start position:0%
based upon the accreditation standards
 
03:19:01.610 --> 03:19:01.620 align:start position:0%
that we have to comply with because we
 
03:19:02.870 --> 03:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
are an internationally accredited
 
03:19:05.269 --> 03:19:05.279 align:start position:0%
emergency medical dispatch agency we
 
03:19:07.010 --> 03:19:07.020 align:start position:0%
also comply with in terms of our
 
03:19:08.630 --> 03:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
training and our recruits when they go
 
03:19:09.889 --> 03:19:09.899 align:start position:0%
through training and complete their
 
03:19:12.410 --> 03:19:12.420 align:start position:0%
training APCO certification which is the
 
03:19:13.790 --> 03:19:13.800 align:start position:0%
association of public Communications
 
03:19:15.769 --> 03:19:15.779 align:start position:0%
officials across the country
 
03:19:19.070 --> 03:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
so we're making sure that our standards
 
03:19:22.010 --> 03:19:22.020 align:start position:0%
our consistent level of training is the
 
03:19:24.290 --> 03:19:24.300 align:start position:0%
same level of training that everyone
 
03:19:26.090 --> 03:19:26.100 align:start position:0%
gets in the state regardless of where
 
03:19:27.410 --> 03:19:27.420 align:start position:0%
they are
 
03:19:29.570 --> 03:19:29.580 align:start position:0%
or when they call 9-1-1
 
03:19:31.250 --> 03:19:31.260 align:start position:0%
what we end up doing when we get that
 
03:19:33.590 --> 03:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
call whether it's a police fire or EMS
 
03:19:35.510 --> 03:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
call depends on the nature of the call
 
03:19:38.090 --> 03:19:38.100 align:start position:0%
those calls are all transferred but some
 
03:19:40.670 --> 03:19:40.680 align:start position:0%
are held on to our telecommunicators
 
03:19:42.590 --> 03:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
because we also provided a value-added
 
03:19:44.690 --> 03:19:44.700 align:start position:0%
service to that Communications piece and
 
03:19:46.010 --> 03:19:46.020 align:start position:0%
to the people in the field who need
 
03:19:46.020 --> 03:19:47.150 align:start position:0%
to the people in the field who need
immediate

03:19:47.150 --> 03:19:47.160 align:start position:0%
immediate
 
03:19:50.269 --> 03:19:50.279 align:start position:0%
assistance first aid and for people who
 
03:19:52.490 --> 03:19:52.500 align:start position:0%
are on scene to render patient care we
 
03:19:53.809 --> 03:19:53.819 align:start position:0%
will then conduct an emergency medical
 
03:19:56.510 --> 03:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
dispatch triage based upon established
 
03:19:58.309 --> 03:19:58.319 align:start position:0%
protocol again pursuant and compliant
 
03:20:00.950 --> 03:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
with our accreditation standards to
 
03:20:02.510 --> 03:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
render assistance to folks in the field
 
03:20:04.370 --> 03:20:04.380 align:start position:0%
prior to the arrival of First Responders
 
03:20:05.690 --> 03:20:05.700 align:start position:0%
we stay on the phone with those
 
03:20:07.130 --> 03:20:07.140 align:start position:0%
individuals as long as it takes
 
03:20:08.929 --> 03:20:08.939 align:start position:0%
sometimes that could take up to an hour
 
03:20:10.550 --> 03:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
or more
 
03:20:12.590 --> 03:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
before First Responders arrive on the
 
03:20:14.630 --> 03:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
scene during that period of time that
 
03:20:16.190 --> 03:20:16.200 align:start position:0%
transfer is already made Downstream to
 
03:20:18.349 --> 03:20:18.359 align:start position:0%
the local communications center so those
 
03:20:21.170 --> 03:20:21.180 align:start position:0%
folks can then transfer that valuable
 
03:20:23.630 --> 03:20:23.640 align:start position:0%
information and give First Responders in
 
03:20:26.570 --> 03:20:26.580 align:start position:0%
the field time and minute by minute and
 
03:20:28.429 --> 03:20:28.439 align:start position:0%
second by second in some cases updates
 
03:20:30.349 --> 03:20:30.359 align:start position:0%
to what's happening because we still
 
03:20:31.730 --> 03:20:31.740 align:start position:0%
have a connection with those folks that
 
03:20:34.070 --> 03:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
are in the field we do not do radio
 
03:20:36.650 --> 03:20:36.660 align:start position:0%
dispatch at 9-1-1 we're not dispatching
 
03:20:38.330 --> 03:20:38.340 align:start position:0%
police officers we're not dispatching
 
03:20:39.830 --> 03:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
firefighters we're not dispatching
 
03:20:41.929 --> 03:20:41.939 align:start position:0%
Emergency Medical Services Personnel or
 
03:20:44.330 --> 03:20:44.340 align:start position:0%
ambulances to a scene we leave that to
 
03:20:46.429 --> 03:20:46.439 align:start position:0%
the 67 communication centers that we
 
03:20:48.110 --> 03:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
actually have a live connection with 24
 
03:20:51.050 --> 03:20:51.060 align:start position:0%
7 365 days a year
 
03:20:52.790 --> 03:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
when I talk about the level of
 
03:20:55.130 --> 03:20:55.140 align:start position:0%
standardization and level of consistency
 
03:20:57.530 --> 03:20:57.540 align:start position:0%
it's based upon the need to make sure
 
03:20:59.090 --> 03:20:59.100 align:start position:0%
that the only the highest level in
 
03:21:00.170 --> 03:21:00.180 align:start position:0%
quality of service that our
 
03:21:02.870 --> 03:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
telecommunicators rendered is the same
 
03:21:05.330 --> 03:21:05.340 align:start position:0%
across the board regardless of where you
 
03:21:07.370 --> 03:21:07.380 align:start position:0%
might be when you make that 9-1-1 call
 
03:21:09.710 --> 03:21:09.720 align:start position:0%
that's not to say that that's the same
 
03:21:11.510 --> 03:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
case everywhere else if you don't make
 
03:21:13.370 --> 03:21:13.380 align:start position:0%
that call to 9-1-1 but you reach out to
 
03:21:14.630 --> 03:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
your local police department or
 
03:21:15.769 --> 03:21:15.779 align:start position:0%
sheriff's department or other
 
03:21:17.510 --> 03:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
communications center because you need
 
03:21:20.150 --> 03:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
help that may not be an emergency yet
 
03:21:22.969 --> 03:21:22.979 align:start position:0%
it's still going to require a police a
 
03:21:24.349 --> 03:21:24.359 align:start position:0%
fire or Emergency Medical Services
 
03:21:26.750 --> 03:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
response now that's not to say again
 
03:21:29.090 --> 03:21:29.100 align:start position:0%
that the training is any less or
 
03:21:31.130 --> 03:21:31.140 align:start position:0%
non-existent again it all depends on the
 
03:21:32.809 --> 03:21:32.819 align:start position:0%
nature and scope of the training but
 
03:21:34.190 --> 03:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
there should be some minimum standards
 
03:21:35.570 --> 03:21:35.580 align:start position:0%
that are established across the board
 
03:21:37.370 --> 03:21:37.380 align:start position:0%
when it comes to
 
03:21:39.710 --> 03:21:39.720 align:start position:0%
the expectations that our citizens and
 
03:21:41.330 --> 03:21:41.340 align:start position:0%
residents have of all of our Public
 
03:21:43.429 --> 03:21:43.439 align:start position:0%
Safety First Responders and again our
 
03:21:45.170 --> 03:21:45.180 align:start position:0%
telecommunications Personnel whether at
 
03:21:47.210 --> 03:21:47.220 align:start position:0%
the 911 Center or the weather in your
 
03:21:49.730 --> 03:21:49.740 align:start position:0%
local Communications centers are the
 
03:21:52.190 --> 03:21:52.200 align:start position:0%
first First Responders and we require of
 
03:21:54.349 --> 03:21:54.359 align:start position:0%
them to maintain the only highest degree
 
03:21:55.790 --> 03:21:55.800 align:start position:0%
of professionalism
 
03:21:57.590 --> 03:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
and talent
 
03:22:01.250 --> 03:22:01.260 align:start position:0%
and continuing education and training we
 
03:22:03.950 --> 03:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
do the folks behind me do and you should
 
03:22:06.290 --> 03:22:06.300 align:start position:0%
expect no less and that's why I'm in
 
03:22:08.030 --> 03:22:08.040 align:start position:0%
support of this bill because if nothing
 
03:22:09.830 --> 03:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
else comes out of this it's going to be
 
03:22:12.469 --> 03:22:12.479 align:start position:0%
some transparent look at what it is that
 
03:22:14.450 --> 03:22:14.460 align:start position:0%
we're doing across the state to try to
 
03:22:15.950 --> 03:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're rendering only the
 
03:22:17.330 --> 03:22:17.340 align:start position:0%
highest level and quality of service
 
03:22:19.490 --> 03:22:19.500 align:start position:0%
that not only our citizens expect but
 
03:22:21.050 --> 03:22:21.060 align:start position:0%
also deserve
 
03:22:23.269 --> 03:22:23.279 align:start position:0%
I have testimony as well from Cecily
 
03:22:24.650 --> 03:22:24.660 align:start position:0%
McNair that'll be able to pass out
 
03:22:26.870 --> 03:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
Cecily is a long-standing 40-year
 
03:22:29.269 --> 03:22:29.279 align:start position:0%
veteran of our Public Safety dispatch
 
03:22:31.370 --> 03:22:31.380 align:start position:0%
community and I also have testimony that
 
03:22:32.690 --> 03:22:32.700 align:start position:0%
I'd be more than happy to email because
 
03:22:34.849 --> 03:22:34.859 align:start position:0%
it has some hyperlinks in it that might
 
03:22:36.530 --> 03:22:36.540 align:start position:0%
be helpful to you as you start to do a
 
03:22:38.210 --> 03:22:38.220 align:start position:0%
little bit more research and I am
 
03:22:39.469 --> 03:22:39.479 align:start position:0%
available for any questions that you
 
03:22:40.929 --> 03:22:40.939 align:start position:0%
might have
 
03:22:44.630 --> 03:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for that in-depth testimony
 
03:22:46.910 --> 03:22:46.920 align:start position:0%
um I noticed that the bills requesting a
 
03:22:48.710 --> 03:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
study committee
 
03:22:51.950 --> 03:22:51.960 align:start position:0%
do you think that this in-depth look is
 
03:22:53.330 --> 03:22:53.340 align:start position:0%
something that could be finished between
 
03:22:56.750 --> 03:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
you know now or actually between July
 
03:22:58.670 --> 03:22:58.680 align:start position:0%
and September or do you think that it
 
03:23:00.410 --> 03:23:00.420 align:start position:0%
would be better off to be made a
 
03:23:03.110 --> 03:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
commission with a Sunset date
 
03:23:05.630 --> 03:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
um that would Sunset after
 
03:23:07.610 --> 03:23:07.620 align:start position:0%
um the study was finished
 
03:23:09.469 --> 03:23:09.479 align:start position:0%
as I read the bill there's a lot in the
 
03:23:12.050 --> 03:23:12.060 align:start position:0%
bill that you should be looking into
 
03:23:14.990 --> 03:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
that will take some time but you do have
 
03:23:16.849 --> 03:23:16.859 align:start position:0%
a lot of folks here in the room and out
 
03:23:18.410 --> 03:23:18.420 align:start position:0%
there in the telecommunicator public
 
03:23:19.809 --> 03:23:19.819 align:start position:0%
safety dispatch
 
03:23:22.010 --> 03:23:22.020 align:start position:0%
Consortium that are willing to step up
 
03:23:23.929 --> 03:23:23.939 align:start position:0%
and help an assist in any way that we we
 
03:23:25.969 --> 03:23:25.979 align:start position:0%
can so it's not to say that you won't
 
03:23:27.590 --> 03:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
get that level of cooperation we're
 
03:23:30.889 --> 03:23:30.899 align:start position:0%
ready to serve do whatever is we need
 
03:23:32.570 --> 03:23:32.580 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if I'm the best person
 
03:23:34.370 --> 03:23:34.380 align:start position:0%
to ask of that because I think it would
 
03:23:35.389 --> 03:23:35.399 align:start position:0%
all depend upon the resource
 
03:23:36.710 --> 03:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
restrictions that you folks would have
 
03:23:38.630 --> 03:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
as well I I just don't want to sell the
 
03:23:40.610 --> 03:23:40.620 align:start position:0%
the issue short because when things are
 
03:23:42.290 --> 03:23:42.300 align:start position:0%
committees we have to have an answer out
 
03:23:44.870 --> 03:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
by the fall and if we aren't done at
 
03:23:46.429 --> 03:23:46.439 align:start position:0%
work it's not going to do it justice
 
03:23:47.870 --> 03:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
understood thank you for the question
 
03:23:51.229 --> 03:23:51.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:52.910 --> 03:23:52.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
03:23:54.170 --> 03:23:54.180 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:23:56.809 --> 03:23:56.819 align:start position:0%
I'm just looking at the definite of the
 
03:23:59.750 --> 03:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
words in line two and three of the uh
 
03:24:02.090 --> 03:24:02.100 align:start position:0%
the bill that says emergency Dispatchers
 
03:24:05.870 --> 03:24:05.880 align:start position:0%
in 911 telecommunic caters
 
03:24:07.370 --> 03:24:07.380 align:start position:0%
and can you just tell me the
 
03:24:09.710 --> 03:24:09.720 align:start position:0%
differentiation one is your set of folks
 
03:24:12.290 --> 03:24:12.300 align:start position:0%
and one is the uh the set of folks that
 
03:24:13.550 --> 03:24:13.560 align:start position:0%
are associated with the people behind
 
03:24:15.950 --> 03:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
you in simplistic terms that's exactly
 
03:24:17.630 --> 03:24:17.640 align:start position:0%
the case and when we talk about 9-1-1
 
03:24:20.050 --> 03:24:20.060 align:start position:0%
telecommunicators they're call
 
03:24:22.309 --> 03:24:22.319 align:start position:0%
receptionists they're reconciling
 
03:24:25.309 --> 03:24:25.319 align:start position:0%
reconciling 9-1-1 calls 9-1-1 calls do
 
03:24:27.349 --> 03:24:27.359 align:start position:0%
not go to your local public safety
 
03:24:29.570 --> 03:24:29.580 align:start position:0%
communications center if you are in I'll
 
03:24:30.889 --> 03:24:30.899 align:start position:0%
use my own example if you're on the town
 
03:24:33.889 --> 03:24:33.899 align:start position:0%
of Merrimack and uh for years I was a
 
03:24:35.389 --> 03:24:35.399 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officer in Merrimack we
 
03:24:36.469 --> 03:24:36.479 align:start position:0%
have our own Public Safety
 
03:24:38.090 --> 03:24:38.100 align:start position:0%
communications center that dispatches
 
03:24:39.889 --> 03:24:39.899 align:start position:0%
for police fire and Emergency Medical
 
03:24:39.899 --> 03:24:41.090 align:start position:0%
for police fire and Emergency Medical
Services

03:24:41.090 --> 03:24:41.100 align:start position:0%
Services
 
03:24:43.429 --> 03:24:43.439 align:start position:0%
we were also connected by virtue of the
 
03:24:45.650 --> 03:24:45.660 align:start position:0%
larger Network that our division
 
03:24:47.030 --> 03:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
currently here at the division of
 
03:24:48.650 --> 03:24:48.660 align:start position:0%
Emergency Services Communications have
 
03:24:50.570 --> 03:24:50.580 align:start position:0%
set up so that when we do a transfer we
 
03:24:52.370 --> 03:24:52.380 align:start position:0%
transfer that call once we receive it at
 
03:24:54.650 --> 03:24:54.660 align:start position:0%
9-1-1 to the local communications center
 
03:24:57.349 --> 03:24:57.359 align:start position:0%
they do the physical dispatch along with
 
03:24:59.269 --> 03:24:59.279 align:start position:0%
a number of other things that depending
 
03:25:01.070 --> 03:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
upon the role and scope of that Dispatch
 
03:25:03.469 --> 03:25:03.479 align:start position:0%
Center would also do in addition to
 
03:25:05.870 --> 03:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
receiving the 9-1-1 call and all of the
 
03:25:08.570 --> 03:25:08.580 align:start position:0%
data that flows along with it
 
03:25:10.010 --> 03:25:10.020 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
03:25:12.170 --> 03:25:12.180 align:start position:0%
follow up and I believe you talked about
 
03:25:14.330 --> 03:25:14.340 align:start position:0%
staying on the phone for an hour and
 
03:25:16.190 --> 03:25:16.200 align:start position:0%
dispatching additional information to
 
03:25:17.809 --> 03:25:17.819 align:start position:0%
the person that made the call
 
03:25:20.269 --> 03:25:20.279 align:start position:0%
is that in both of those places and do
 
03:25:21.889 --> 03:25:21.899 align:start position:0%
they transfer information or how does
 
03:25:23.269 --> 03:25:23.279 align:start position:0%
that work
 
03:25:25.670 --> 03:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
anecdotally we have a number of cases
 
03:25:28.190 --> 03:25:28.200 align:start position:0%
where as you know New Hampshire is a
 
03:25:30.170 --> 03:25:30.180 align:start position:0%
diverse State meaning there are a lot of
 
03:25:32.030 --> 03:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
geographical and topographical issues
 
03:25:33.650 --> 03:25:33.660 align:start position:0%
associated with the nature and
 
03:25:35.690 --> 03:25:35.700 align:start position:0%
timeliness of a response for example the
 
03:25:37.610 --> 03:25:37.620 align:start position:0%
time that you're going to get in in
 
03:25:39.410 --> 03:25:39.420 align:start position:0%
terms of a response within the city of
 
03:25:41.030 --> 03:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
Manchester or the city of Nashua or an
 
03:25:43.010 --> 03:25:43.020 align:start position:0%
urban area is going to be markedly
 
03:25:44.570 --> 03:25:44.580 align:start position:0%
different than it would in an area
 
03:25:44.580 --> 03:25:45.849 align:start position:0%
different than it would in an area
that's

03:25:45.849 --> 03:25:45.859 align:start position:0%
that's
 
03:25:48.650 --> 03:25:48.660 align:start position:0%
a little less served from the public
 
03:25:48.660 --> 03:25:49.849 align:start position:0%
a little less served from the public
safety

03:25:49.849 --> 03:25:49.859 align:start position:0%

03:25:52.429 --> 03:25:52.439 align:start position:0%
perspective such as in the town of
 
03:25:54.290 --> 03:25:54.300 align:start position:0%
Colebrook or in Grafton County for
 
03:25:56.330 --> 03:25:56.340 align:start position:0%
example and that's not to say because
 
03:25:59.090 --> 03:25:59.100 align:start position:0%
that they are any less equipped but they
 
03:26:01.250 --> 03:26:01.260 align:start position:0%
have fewer resources to allocate but
 
03:26:02.870 --> 03:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
there may be occasions where we're on a
 
03:26:05.330 --> 03:26:05.340 align:start position:0%
9-1-1 call where we're rendering patient
 
03:26:08.030 --> 03:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
care during that time it takes for an
 
03:26:09.830 --> 03:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
individual to arrive whether it's a
 
03:26:11.210 --> 03:26:11.220 align:start position:0%
police officer whether it's a
 
03:26:12.469 --> 03:26:12.479 align:start position:0%
firefighter whether it's emerging
 
03:26:14.990 --> 03:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
Medical Services personnel and some of
 
03:26:17.090 --> 03:26:17.100 align:start position:0%
those calls can last many minutes some
 
03:26:18.710 --> 03:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
of those calls can actually last if it's
 
03:26:19.910 --> 03:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
our search and rescue and we've had
 
03:26:21.950 --> 03:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
these occur where they've lasted several
 
03:26:23.929 --> 03:26:23.939 align:start position:0%
hours we've stayed on a phone with
 
03:26:26.150 --> 03:26:26.160 align:start position:0%

training and developing our team members
 
03:27:49.550 --> 03:27:49.560 align:start position:0%

some agencies like mine go above and

beyond and others provide minimal

like mine
 
03:28:50.690 --> 03:28:50.700 align:start position:0%
in my 27 years of professional Public

Safety Communications experience and as
 
03:28:54.290 --> 03:28:54.300 align:start position:0%
a leader in this profession not only in
 
03:28:55.969 --> 03:28:55.979 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the region and nationally
 
03:28:58.309 --> 03:28:58.319 align:start position:0%
I believe strongly in National standards
 
03:28:59.929 --> 03:28:59.939 align:start position:0%
and best practices as they relate to
 
03:29:01.809 --> 03:29:01.819 align:start position:0%
emergency dispatching
 
03:29:04.429 --> 03:29:04.439 align:start position:0%
lrmfa is one of only three agencies in
 
03:29:05.809 --> 03:29:05.819 align:start position:0%
the state that have voluntarily
 
03:29:07.490 --> 03:29:07.500 align:start position:0%
submitted their new hire and continuing

education training programs to the

program that certifies 111 individual
 
03:29:27.349 --> 03:29:27.359 align:start position:0%
standards have been met or exceeded
 
03:29:29.450 --> 03:29:29.460 align:start position:0%
pertaining to the national minimum
 
03:29:31.250 --> 03:29:31.260 align:start position:0%
acceptable standard
 
03:29:33.950 --> 03:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
which does exist nationally
 
03:29:35.870 --> 03:29:35.880 align:start position:0%
as a state we train our police officers
 
03:29:37.250 --> 03:29:37.260 align:start position:0%
and our firefighters to a Statewide
 
03:29:39.349 --> 03:29:39.359 align:start position:0%
standard so that they're trained the
 
03:29:40.969 --> 03:29:40.979 align:start position:0%
same and the expectation of service from
 
03:29:42.469 --> 03:29:42.479 align:start position:0%
the public
 
03:29:46.070 --> 03:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:47.929 --> 03:29:47.939 align:start position:0%
with such a disparity in public safety
 
03:29:50.030 --> 03:29:50.040 align:start position:0%
telecommunicator training and dispatcher
 
03:29:51.590 --> 03:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
training in New Hampshire I believe that
 
03:29:52.910 --> 03:29:52.920 align:start position:0%
we're doing a disservice to the public
 
03:29:55.010 --> 03:29:55.020 align:start position:0%
and the Public Safety First Responders
 
03:29:58.370 --> 03:29:58.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:00.590 --> 03:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
we all go to barber shops or salons for
 
03:30:02.750 --> 03:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
service such as colors haircuts hair
 
03:30:05.210 --> 03:30:05.220 align:start position:0%
styling my wife's a hairdresser so I I
 
03:30:08.030 --> 03:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
can speak to it she went through 1500
 
03:30:09.650 --> 03:30:09.660 align:start position:0%
hours of training and schooling before
 
03:30:11.030 --> 03:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
she could submit to the Board of
 
03:30:13.010 --> 03:30:13.020 align:start position:0%
Professional licensure to be licensed as
 
03:30:15.349 --> 03:30:15.359 align:start position:0%
a hairdresser but there's no regulation
 
03:30:16.790 --> 03:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
regarding training for New Hampshire's
 
03:30:19.250 --> 03:30:19.260 align:start position:0%
first First Responders
 
03:30:20.990 --> 03:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
I strongly believe this is a subject
 
03:30:22.429 --> 03:30:22.439 align:start position:0%
that should be studied to determine if
 
03:30:24.050 --> 03:30:24.060 align:start position:0%
we are in fact providing the utmost
 
03:30:25.790 --> 03:30:25.800 align:start position:0%
professional Public Safety and emergency
 
03:30:27.469 --> 03:30:27.479 align:start position:0%
services to our state's residents
 
03:30:30.170 --> 03:30:30.180 align:start position:0%
visitors and public safety personnel
 
03:30:32.090 --> 03:30:32.100 align:start position:0%
again I am in support of the Bill thank
 
03:30:33.410 --> 03:30:33.420 align:start position:0%
you for your time and I'm happy to
 
03:30:36.830 --> 03:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:40.250 --> 03:30:40.260 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
03:30:43.490 --> 03:30:43.500 align:start position:0%
are you envisioning some type of an
 
03:30:46.790 --> 03:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
academy style training or are you what
 
03:30:49.309 --> 03:30:49.319 align:start position:0%
do you put your folks through new hires
 
03:30:53.570 --> 03:30:53.580 align:start position:0%
so the 111 standards that APCO has has
 
03:30:55.610 --> 03:30:55.620 align:start position:0%
deemed to be the minimum acceptable
 
03:30:58.070 --> 03:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
level of training nationally now
 
03:30:59.809 --> 03:30:59.819 align:start position:0%
obviously those aren't recognized in
 
03:31:01.010 --> 03:31:01.020 align:start position:0%
this state there are states they are
 
03:31:02.269 --> 03:31:02.279 align:start position:0%
recognized in
 
03:31:04.490 --> 03:31:04.500 align:start position:0%
my staff goes through about a 12 to 14
 
03:31:06.769 --> 03:31:06.779 align:start position:0%
week training period there's organized
 
03:31:08.630 --> 03:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
course structure the certifications that
 
03:31:09.969 --> 03:31:09.979 align:start position:0%
they have to obtain
 
03:31:12.050 --> 03:31:12.060 align:start position:0%
obviously there's on the job training
 
03:31:13.429 --> 03:31:13.439 align:start position:0%
that they have to that that they go
 
03:31:15.229 --> 03:31:15.239 align:start position:0%
through eventually when they're when
 
03:31:18.530 --> 03:31:18.540 align:start position:0%
they're um capable and have passed all
 
03:31:20.690 --> 03:31:20.700 align:start position:0%
of that requisite training they're
 
03:31:23.030 --> 03:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
released from training in such in such a
 
03:31:25.910 --> 03:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
way that they can now effectively work
 
03:31:27.469 --> 03:31:27.479 align:start position:0%
um they are never my staff is never
 
03:31:29.030 --> 03:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
allowed to work
 
03:31:29.040 --> 03:31:29.750 align:start position:0%
allowed to work
um

03:31:29.750 --> 03:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:31:32.389 --> 03:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
we have two people on duty 24 7. so my
 
03:31:34.550 --> 03:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
staff is never part of that Staffing
 
03:31:36.469 --> 03:31:36.479 align:start position:0%
Matrix until they've successfully
 
03:31:38.750 --> 03:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
completed the program
 
03:31:38.760 --> 03:31:40.550 align:start position:0%
completed the program
and

03:31:40.550 --> 03:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:31:43.190 --> 03:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
do you have an approximate because what
 
03:31:45.410 --> 03:31:45.420 align:start position:0%
we in other words what will this cause
 
03:31:48.170 --> 03:31:48.180 align:start position:0%
municipality to adopt this
 
03:31:51.170 --> 03:31:51.180 align:start position:0%
per per service that's a great question
 
03:31:53.269 --> 03:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
and and if I could go back and I didn't
 
03:31:54.889 --> 03:31:54.899 align:start position:0%
fully answer your previous question what
 
03:31:58.130 --> 03:31:58.140 align:start position:0%
I would Envision is is is a standard
 
03:31:59.870 --> 03:31:59.880 align:start position:0%
probably meeting or exceeding what's
 
03:32:01.370 --> 03:32:01.380 align:start position:0%
already existing at the national level
 
03:32:04.070 --> 03:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
that the state adopts
 
03:32:06.110 --> 03:32:06.120 align:start position:0%
I would love to see an academy style
 
03:32:07.849 --> 03:32:07.859 align:start position:0%
I've written new articles for for
 
03:32:09.229 --> 03:32:09.239 align:start position:0%
journals on that
 
03:32:10.910 --> 03:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
um I would love to see that I don't know
 
03:32:12.590 --> 03:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
that we're there what what would
 
03:32:14.929 --> 03:32:14.939 align:start position:0%
probably be more palatable is here's the
 
03:32:17.269 --> 03:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
standard that your agency needs to to
 
03:32:20.150 --> 03:32:20.160 align:start position:0%
meet they're the the dispatch world is
 
03:32:20.160 --> 03:32:21.530 align:start position:0%
meet they're the the dispatch world is
is

03:32:21.530 --> 03:32:21.540 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:32:23.510 --> 03:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
as small if not smaller than public
 
03:32:25.610 --> 03:32:25.620 align:start position:0%
State than police and fire right there's
 
03:32:28.130 --> 03:32:28.140 align:start position:0%
enough people in the state that are
 
03:32:29.870 --> 03:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
active in this profession that could
 
03:32:31.370 --> 03:32:31.380 align:start position:0%
offer whatever trainings need to be
 
03:32:32.809 --> 03:32:32.819 align:start position:0%
offered I'm an instructor for one of
 
03:32:34.070 --> 03:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
those courses that I think would be
 
03:32:36.170 --> 03:32:36.180 align:start position:0%
absolutely important there's no reason
 
03:32:37.969 --> 03:32:37.979 align:start position:0%
why we wouldn't build a Cadre of
 
03:32:40.010 --> 03:32:40.020 align:start position:0%
instructors and I don't mean that you
 
03:32:41.090 --> 03:32:41.100 align:start position:0%
need to meet the standard tomorrow
 
03:32:43.190 --> 03:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
before you work maybe there's a
 
03:32:45.710 --> 03:32:45.720 align:start position:0%
lead up time six months you know
 
03:32:47.210 --> 03:32:47.220 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
03:32:48.769 --> 03:32:48.779 align:start position:0%
um but I think that there's the ability
 
03:32:51.229 --> 03:32:51.239 align:start position:0%
to to construct some sort of a standard
 
03:32:55.190 --> 03:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
that that says you need to do this
 
03:32:57.710 --> 03:32:57.720 align:start position:0%
in a reasonable amount of time I ask
 
03:32:59.750 --> 03:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
because we have to be cognizant of of
 
03:33:02.330 --> 03:33:02.340 align:start position:0%
our duties not to make unfunded mandates
 
03:33:04.309 --> 03:33:04.319 align:start position:0%
so if we're going to propose something
 
03:33:05.690 --> 03:33:05.700 align:start position:0%
we need to know how much it's going to
 
03:33:08.210 --> 03:33:08.220 align:start position:0%
cost so I'm trying to and perhaps that
 
03:33:09.530 --> 03:33:09.540 align:start position:0%
would be the point of the committee to
 
03:33:11.870 --> 03:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
figure out what that what that would be
 
03:33:13.969 --> 03:33:13.979 align:start position:0%
um further questions
 
03:33:15.530 --> 03:33:15.540 align:start position:0%
Representative no
 
03:33:17.269 --> 03:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
just thank the chair for addressing both
 
03:33:19.550 --> 03:33:19.560 align:start position:0%
of my questions
 
03:33:21.830 --> 03:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
and if I may the cost is obviously a
 
03:33:21.840 --> 03:33:23.570 align:start position:0%
and if I may the cost is obviously a
concern

03:33:23.570 --> 03:33:23.580 align:start position:0%
concern
 
03:33:26.870 --> 03:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
my agency and and the previous agency so
 
03:33:28.670 --> 03:33:28.680 align:start position:0%
the three agencies that I mentioned that
 
03:33:30.469 --> 03:33:30.479 align:start position:0%
have this level of certification or
 
03:33:32.990 --> 03:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
myself my agency uh New Hampshire 9-1-1
 
03:33:35.269 --> 03:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
and dairy fire
 
03:33:35.279 --> 03:33:36.290 align:start position:0%
and dairy fire
um

03:33:36.290 --> 03:33:36.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:33:39.950 --> 03:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
because I my
 
03:33:42.290 --> 03:33:42.300 align:start position:0%
governance structure if you will hired
 
03:33:45.590 --> 03:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
me to to manage the agency they knew
 
03:33:47.630 --> 03:33:47.640 align:start position:0%
that standards and best practices that's
 
03:33:50.450 --> 03:33:50.460 align:start position:0%
that's my um my my bread and butter if
 
03:33:52.070 --> 03:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
you will it's important I can tell you
 
03:33:54.710 --> 03:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
my people do the best job but unless I'm
 
03:33:56.030 --> 03:33:56.040 align:start position:0%
adhering to some sort of National
 
03:33:57.590 --> 03:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
Standard or best practice I don't really
 
03:34:00.290 --> 03:34:00.300 align:start position:0%
have direction to give them the tools to
 
03:34:02.809 --> 03:34:02.819 align:start position:0%
do that I think it's important that that
 
03:34:02.819 --> 03:34:03.729 align:start position:0%
do that I think it's important that that
sure

03:34:03.729 --> 03:34:03.739 align:start position:0%
sure
 
03:34:07.190 --> 03:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
agencies absolutely
 
03:34:09.229 --> 03:34:09.239 align:start position:0%
are there's going to be there's going to
 
03:34:11.030 --> 03:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
be a need for for some sort of funding
 
03:34:12.349 --> 03:34:12.359 align:start position:0%
right but we're already training our
 
03:34:13.729 --> 03:34:13.739 align:start position:0%
people we're already doing some sort of
 
03:34:15.830 --> 03:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
new hire trading this could just be an
 
03:34:17.809 --> 03:34:17.819 align:start position:0%
expansion upon that this could be as
 
03:34:19.550 --> 03:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
Staffing allows there's there's ways
 
03:34:21.590 --> 03:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
that you can get around that
 
03:34:21.600 --> 03:34:22.309 align:start position:0%
that you can get around that
um

03:34:22.309 --> 03:34:22.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:24.469 --> 03:34:24.479 align:start position:0%
Cecily McNair whose testimony you have
 
03:34:27.170 --> 03:34:27.180 align:start position:0%
in writing many many years ago actually
 
03:34:29.090 --> 03:34:29.100 align:start position:0%
created a New Hampshire dispatcher
 
03:34:29.100 --> 03:34:30.349 align:start position:0%
created a New Hampshire dispatcher
Academy

03:34:30.349 --> 03:34:30.359 align:start position:0%
Academy
 
03:34:32.030 --> 03:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
um and it was held typically at police
 
03:34:34.429 --> 03:34:34.439 align:start position:0%
standards and training every year uh and
 
03:34:36.469 --> 03:34:36.479 align:start position:0%
tons of people went and it was great it
 
03:34:38.150 --> 03:34:38.160 align:start position:0%
was geared towards you know you can
 
03:34:39.650 --> 03:34:39.660 align:start position:0%
teach somebody about dispatching in
 
03:34:41.330 --> 03:34:41.340 align:start position:0%
Florida and it's very different than New
 
03:34:42.650 --> 03:34:42.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because of the infrastructure
 
03:34:44.870 --> 03:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
and how we do things but that particular
 
03:34:47.450 --> 03:34:47.460 align:start position:0%
Academy if you will was it was a great
 
03:34:49.790 --> 03:34:49.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity for for that Baseline level
 
03:34:51.229 --> 03:34:51.239 align:start position:0%
of training I think it's important to
 
03:34:53.510 --> 03:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
recognize we don't handle police officer
 
03:34:55.370 --> 03:34:55.380 align:start position:0%
a set of keys a gun and a handcuff and
 
03:34:58.309 --> 03:34:58.319 align:start position:0%
say go go enforce the law we don't
 
03:35:00.290 --> 03:35:00.300 align:start position:0%
handle firemen keys to a fire truck and
 
03:35:02.269 --> 03:35:02.279 align:start position:0%
say go put out fires we have an expected
 
03:35:04.070 --> 03:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
level of service for them and I think
 
03:35:06.050 --> 03:35:06.060 align:start position:0%
this third level of service if you will
 
03:35:07.849 --> 03:35:07.859 align:start position:0%
this emergency communications component
 
03:35:09.769 --> 03:35:09.779 align:start position:0%
we should absolutely expect the same
 
03:35:11.450 --> 03:35:11.460 align:start position:0%
level of service and training
 
03:35:13.190 --> 03:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
commensurate with the responsibility
 
03:35:15.769 --> 03:35:15.779 align:start position:0%
that these Personnel are executing on a
 
03:35:17.809 --> 03:35:17.819 align:start position:0%
daily basis
 
03:35:20.809 --> 03:35:20.819 align:start position:0%
thank you what about do some departments
 
03:35:23.750 --> 03:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
um in the state cross utilize in other
 
03:35:26.030 --> 03:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
words they'll have police officers
 
03:35:28.190 --> 03:35:28.200 align:start position:0%
handling some dispatch firefighters
 
03:35:30.170 --> 03:35:30.180 align:start position:0%
handling some dispatch how would your
 
03:35:32.870 --> 03:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
program take that into account or
 
03:35:34.729 --> 03:35:34.739 align:start position:0%
there are absolutely some agencies that
 
03:35:36.110 --> 03:35:36.120 align:start position:0%
do that
 
03:35:37.550 --> 03:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
um there are some certainly on the fire
 
03:35:39.170 --> 03:35:39.180 align:start position:0%
side that do that and and there may be
 
03:35:40.729 --> 03:35:40.739 align:start position:0%
some on the police side
 
03:35:40.739 --> 03:35:42.349 align:start position:0%
some on the police side
um

03:35:42.349 --> 03:35:42.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:44.450 --> 03:35:44.460 align:start position:0%
you know back many many years ago before
 
03:35:46.490 --> 03:35:46.500 align:start position:0%
I realized that smoking was bad it was
 
03:35:48.830 --> 03:35:48.840 align:start position:0%
not uncommon at the time to say hey can
 
03:35:50.030 --> 03:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
you watch the desk for a few minutes I'm
 
03:35:51.830 --> 03:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
going to step outside
 
03:35:53.809 --> 03:35:53.819 align:start position:0%
in a perfect world I would love to say
 
03:35:57.110 --> 03:35:57.120 align:start position:0%
no more right but I think you have to
 
03:35:58.910 --> 03:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
give agencies some flexibility to manage
 
03:36:01.429 --> 03:36:01.439 align:start position:0%
themselves I think this would be if this
 
03:36:04.849 --> 03:36:04.859 align:start position:0%
is your primary job or your your part of
 
03:36:06.349 --> 03:36:06.359 align:start position:0%
your if you're a firefighter or police
 
03:36:08.870 --> 03:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
officer that's able to work in dispatch
 
03:36:10.490 --> 03:36:10.500 align:start position:0%
not necessarily fill in for 10 minutes
 
03:36:11.929 --> 03:36:11.939 align:start position:0%
while somebody goes to make a phone call
 
03:36:13.670 --> 03:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
but you're going to sit there for a
 
03:36:15.110 --> 03:36:15.120 align:start position:0%
shift or a period of time and be
 
03:36:16.610 --> 03:36:16.620 align:start position:0%
expected to answer these these emergency
 
03:36:19.370 --> 03:36:19.380 align:start position:0%
calls from the psap or from the public I
 
03:36:20.809 --> 03:36:20.819 align:start position:0%
think you would have you should go
 
03:36:22.370 --> 03:36:22.380 align:start position:0%
through this
 
03:36:26.510 --> 03:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:28.490 --> 03:36:28.500 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
03:36:28.500 --> 03:36:30.349 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
oh

03:36:30.349 --> 03:36:30.359 align:start position:0%
oh
 
03:36:30.359 --> 03:36:32.630 align:start position:0%
oh
foreign

03:36:32.630 --> 03:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
03:36:35.210 --> 03:36:35.220 align:start position:0%
so to your knowledge most
 
03:36:36.830 --> 03:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
departments that have a Dispatch Center
 
03:36:41.950 --> 03:36:41.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:44.809 --> 03:36:44.819 align:start position:0%
there I would have to say yes I mean
 
03:36:47.630 --> 03:36:47.640 align:start position:0%
there has to be basic training and it it
 
03:36:49.429 --> 03:36:49.439 align:start position:0%
could be as simple as this is how we put
 
03:36:51.349 --> 03:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
calls on hold this is you know the rate
 
03:36:53.809 --> 03:36:53.819 align:start position:0%
the button to transmit on the radio it
 
03:36:55.429 --> 03:36:55.439 align:start position:0%
could be as simplistic as that when you
 
03:36:58.670 --> 03:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
say basic training or it could be a 16
 
03:37:01.610 --> 03:37:01.620 align:start position:0%
or 14 week training program when when I
 
03:37:03.410 --> 03:37:03.420 align:start position:0%
first started in New Hampshire back
 
03:37:05.510 --> 03:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
years ago I literally sat with the
 
03:37:07.849 --> 03:37:07.859 align:start position:0%
senior dispatcher for 40 hours
 
03:37:10.429 --> 03:37:10.439 align:start position:0%
and then on Saturday night I was told if
 
03:37:11.690 --> 03:37:11.700 align:start position:0%
you don't kill anybody tonight you're
 
03:37:12.950 --> 03:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
going to be on your own and you're going
 
03:37:15.050 --> 03:37:15.060 align:start position:0%
to be released from training my very
 
03:37:17.269 --> 03:37:17.279 align:start position:0%
first call was happened to be a stabbing
 
03:37:20.929 --> 03:37:20.939 align:start position:0%
in a vestibule of a supermarket
 
03:37:23.210 --> 03:37:23.220 align:start position:0%
I wasn't I did fine but I wasn't
 
03:37:25.910 --> 03:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
prepared for that and and to what
 
03:37:27.410 --> 03:37:27.420 align:start position:0%
director Doyle's point about Evolution
 
03:37:29.750 --> 03:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
right that was 25 years ago the the
 
03:37:29.760 --> 03:37:31.130 align:start position:0%
right that was 25 years ago the the
evolution

03:37:31.130 --> 03:37:31.140 align:start position:0%
evolution
 
03:37:33.050 --> 03:37:33.060 align:start position:0%
in the industry has changed to a point
 
03:37:35.090 --> 03:37:35.100 align:start position:0%
where we shouldn't sit back any longer
 
03:37:37.370 --> 03:37:37.380 align:start position:0%
and allow that here's the keys here's
 
03:37:38.269 --> 03:37:38.279 align:start position:0%
the map
 
03:37:39.889 --> 03:37:39.899 align:start position:0%
good luck
 
03:37:42.050 --> 03:37:42.060 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up
 
03:37:44.630 --> 03:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
so your idea is that if you're going to
 
03:37:46.130 --> 03:37:46.140 align:start position:0%
do basic training
 
03:37:48.229 --> 03:37:48.239 align:start position:0%
this should be the standard that you're
 
03:37:50.870 --> 03:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
you're training them to every EMT basic
 
03:37:52.429 --> 03:37:52.439 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire is trained
 
03:37:53.630 --> 03:37:53.640 align:start position:0%
to the basic level of the National
 
03:37:55.309 --> 03:37:55.319 align:start position:0%
Registry of EMTs
 
03:37:57.170 --> 03:37:57.180 align:start position:0%
let's do that if an agency wants to
 
03:38:00.050 --> 03:38:00.060 align:start position:0%
spend more money or create higher levels
 
03:38:02.150 --> 03:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
of training or or
 
03:38:03.889 --> 03:38:03.899 align:start position:0%
have their people go through higher
 
03:38:05.150 --> 03:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
levels of training to make them more
 
03:38:07.309 --> 03:38:07.319 align:start position:0%
proficient at
 
03:38:08.870 --> 03:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
you can have a basic level of training
 
03:38:10.130 --> 03:38:10.140 align:start position:0%
and then you could be really proficient
 
03:38:11.630 --> 03:38:11.640 align:start position:0%
at law enforcement dispatch and really
 
03:38:13.849 --> 03:38:13.859 align:start position:0%
proficient at firing EMS dispatch but
 
03:38:15.410 --> 03:38:15.420 align:start position:0%
everybody should start with that basic
 
03:38:15.420 --> 03:38:16.550 align:start position:0%
everybody should start with that basic
level

03:38:16.550 --> 03:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
level
 
03:38:19.250 --> 03:38:19.260 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
03:38:20.690 --> 03:38:20.700 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time
 
03:38:33.650 --> 03:38:33.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:36.290 --> 03:38:36.300 align:start position:0%
thank you chair and representatives I'm
 
03:38:38.269 --> 03:38:38.279 align:start position:0%
Tom ambross I'm currently the director
 
03:38:40.729 --> 03:38:40.739 align:start position:0%
of communications for the Grafton County
 
03:38:42.070 --> 03:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
Sheriff's Department
 
03:38:45.110 --> 03:38:45.120 align:start position:0%
as director Doyle referenced I'm one of
 
03:38:49.969 --> 03:38:49.979 align:start position:0%
those rural folks who have to man manage
 
03:38:52.330 --> 03:38:52.340 align:start position:0%
responses a little bit differently than
 
03:38:55.490 --> 03:38:55.500 align:start position:0%
some other more populated places
 
03:38:58.729 --> 03:38:58.739 align:start position:0%
I don't have uh I don't duplicate a lot
 
03:39:00.349 --> 03:39:00.359 align:start position:0%
of the information you've already heard
 
03:39:02.030 --> 03:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
from the director and the chief they've
 
03:39:04.269 --> 03:39:04.279 align:start position:0%
done a great job in covering our
 
03:39:09.410 --> 03:39:09.420 align:start position:0%
industry I am excited to look out to the
 
03:39:11.690 --> 03:39:11.700 align:start position:0%
committee and see Public Safety folks
 
03:39:15.590 --> 03:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
because I think you know that what we
 
03:39:18.110 --> 03:39:18.120 align:start position:0%
are asking for here
 
03:39:20.090 --> 03:39:20.100 align:start position:0%
um is the right thing and it could be a
 
03:39:22.150 --> 03:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
good starting point
 
03:39:26.090 --> 03:39:26.100 align:start position:0%
the public safety dispatch folks are the
 
03:39:29.090 --> 03:39:29.100 align:start position:0%
only ones in public safety who don't
 
03:39:31.670 --> 03:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
have formalized certification and
 
03:39:31.680 --> 03:39:33.290 align:start position:0%
have formalized certification and
training

03:39:33.290 --> 03:39:33.300 align:start position:0%
training
 
03:39:36.229 --> 03:39:36.239 align:start position:0%
um those those that do police fire and
 
03:39:38.750 --> 03:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
EMS the reality is they don't go
 
03:39:40.849 --> 03:39:40.859 align:start position:0%
anywhere until our people tell them
 
03:39:42.530 --> 03:39:42.540 align:start position:0%
where to go
 
03:39:42.540 --> 03:39:43.190 align:start position:0%
where to go
um

03:39:43.190 --> 03:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:45.830 --> 03:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
I would like to highlight the very first
 
03:39:48.170 --> 03:39:48.180 align:start position:0%
question that I heard of the very first
 
03:39:48.180 --> 03:39:49.309 align:start position:0%
question that I heard of the very first
speaker

03:39:49.309 --> 03:39:49.319 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
03:39:51.950 --> 03:39:51.960 align:start position:0%
what is wrong with the current standard
 
03:39:54.349 --> 03:39:54.359 align:start position:0%
is how I took the question
 
03:39:58.790 --> 03:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
the answer is we have so
 
03:40:03.469 --> 03:40:03.479 align:start position:0%
few standards to meet we cannot none of
 
03:40:05.570 --> 03:40:05.580 align:start position:0%
us can tell you how many of us there are
 
03:40:05.580 --> 03:40:06.530 align:start position:0%
us can tell you how many of us there are
today

03:40:06.530 --> 03:40:06.540 align:start position:0%
today
 
03:40:09.670 --> 03:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
that's how less
 
03:40:13.010 --> 03:40:13.020 align:start position:0%
how little we track the public safety
 
03:40:15.830 --> 03:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
Communications industry in our state I
 
03:40:18.490 --> 03:40:18.500 align:start position:0%
think the study is the right thing to do
 
03:40:21.410 --> 03:40:21.420 align:start position:0%
I think it's great that our industry is
 
03:40:24.530 --> 03:40:24.540 align:start position:0%
asking for it and is supporting it I
 
03:40:26.929 --> 03:40:26.939 align:start position:0%
believe that the associations of those
 
03:40:30.550 --> 03:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
other disciplines who already enjoy
 
03:40:33.349 --> 03:40:33.359 align:start position:0%
excellent training and certification
 
03:40:35.630 --> 03:40:35.640 align:start position:0%
programs will support it
 
03:40:35.640 --> 03:40:38.750 align:start position:0%
programs will support it
and

03:40:38.750 --> 03:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:46.010 --> 03:40:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:48.769 --> 03:40:48.779 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
03:40:50.690 --> 03:40:50.700 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who has not turned
 
03:40:52.250 --> 03:40:52.260 align:start position:0%
in a pink card to wish to testify on
 
03:40:56.630 --> 03:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:59.030 --> 03:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
seeing none I am going to close the
 
03:41:02.630 --> 03:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
public hearing on HP 376 and the
 
03:41:06.910 --> 03:41:06.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:06.920 --> 03:41:08.750 align:start position:0%
 
130.

03:41:08.750 --> 03:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
130.

foreign

04:30:08.750 --> 04:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:08.760 --> 04:30:10.429 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:30:10.429 --> 04:30:10.439 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:30:13.849 --> 04:30:13.859 align:start position:0%
good afternoon one being 1 30 I will
 
04:30:15.950 --> 04:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
open up the
 
04:30:19.729 --> 04:30:19.739 align:start position:0%
public hearing for
 
04:30:22.490 --> 04:30:22.500 align:start position:0%
for House Bill 481 relative to arrest
 
04:30:24.889 --> 04:30:24.899 align:start position:0%
warrants and search warrants committee
 
04:30:27.590 --> 04:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative yokilo am I
 
04:30:30.710 --> 04:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:33.110 --> 04:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you members
 
04:30:34.670 --> 04:30:34.680 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
04:30:39.290 --> 04:30:39.300 align:start position:0%
um this bill uh HB 481 I'm here to
 
04:30:43.490 --> 04:30:43.500 align:start position:0%
present to you today and it the purpose
 
04:30:46.070 --> 04:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
of this is to essentially
 
04:30:46.080 --> 04:30:47.149 align:start position:0%
of this is to essentially
um

04:30:47.149 --> 04:30:47.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:52.790 --> 04:30:52.800 align:start position:0%
uh allow for more clarity to the
 
04:30:54.370 --> 04:30:54.380 align:start position:0%
decision makers and whether or not
 
04:30:58.070 --> 04:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
search warrants and arrest warrants are
 
04:30:58.080 --> 04:30:59.570 align:start position:0%
search warrants and arrest warrants are
appropriate

04:30:59.570 --> 04:30:59.580 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
04:31:02.809 --> 04:31:02.819 align:start position:0%
um and and to not allow
 
04:31:06.769 --> 04:31:06.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:09.649 --> 04:31:09.659 align:start position:0%
um used in
 
04:31:13.309 --> 04:31:13.319 align:start position:0%
um by by like judge shopping and going
 
04:31:15.410 --> 04:31:15.420 align:start position:0%
from one judge and and asking for a
 
04:31:16.550 --> 04:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
search warrant and then if it gets
 
04:31:18.110 --> 04:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
denied going to another judge and that
 
04:31:20.689 --> 04:31:20.699 align:start position:0%
other judge doesn't know that the the
 
04:31:23.750 --> 04:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
another judge has previously denied the
 
04:31:26.510 --> 04:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
request based on the same evidence
 
04:31:29.389 --> 04:31:29.399 align:start position:0%
um and so what this would require is if
 
04:31:30.830 --> 04:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
you're using
 
04:31:33.769 --> 04:31:33.779 align:start position:0%
um if you uh request either a search
 
04:31:37.010 --> 04:31:37.020 align:start position:0%
warrant or a arrest warrant with a
 
04:31:39.349 --> 04:31:39.359 align:start position:0%
specific evidence and that request is
 
04:31:42.710 --> 04:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
denied that if you request that a search
 
04:31:46.550 --> 04:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
warrant or arrest warrant again that you
 
04:31:49.910 --> 04:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
have to notify that judge or submit that
 
04:31:52.910 --> 04:31:52.920 align:start position:0%
evidence that it was previously denied
 
04:31:54.889 --> 04:31:54.899 align:start position:0%
so that the judge can make an informed
 
04:31:57.530 --> 04:31:57.540 align:start position:0%
decision and maybe talk to the other
 
04:32:00.830 --> 04:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
judge if if necessary about the reasons
 
04:32:00.840 --> 04:32:02.030 align:start position:0%
judge if if necessary about the reasons
why

04:32:02.030 --> 04:32:02.040 align:start position:0%
why
 
04:32:05.389 --> 04:32:05.399 align:start position:0%
um a specific warrant was denied and so
 
04:32:07.969 --> 04:32:07.979 align:start position:0%
that that give gives that um
 
04:32:12.469 --> 04:32:12.479 align:start position:0%
uh judge kind of like the understanding
 
04:32:14.389 --> 04:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
that they could be able to have that
 
04:32:15.710 --> 04:32:15.720 align:start position:0%
conversation with the other judge and
 
04:32:17.809 --> 04:32:17.819 align:start position:0%
understand where what's going on with
 
04:32:20.090 --> 04:32:20.100 align:start position:0%
this case
 
04:32:23.870 --> 04:32:23.880 align:start position:0%
um also that if um
 
04:32:27.229 --> 04:32:27.239 align:start position:0%
that in this bill it
 
04:32:31.309 --> 04:32:31.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:31.319 --> 04:32:33.889 align:start position:0%
 
the

04:32:33.889 --> 04:32:33.899 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:32:36.649 --> 04:32:36.659 align:start position:0%
that the state shall disclose
 
04:32:39.769 --> 04:32:39.779 align:start position:0%
um that same information if they're
 
04:32:41.570 --> 04:32:41.580 align:start position:0%
presenting information to the grand jury
 
04:32:44.510 --> 04:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
so you can't go to the judge ask for an
 
04:32:46.610 --> 04:32:46.620 align:start position:0%
arrest warrant it get denied and then go
 
04:32:50.149 --> 04:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
to a grand jury and ask for
 
04:32:50.159 --> 04:32:50.870 align:start position:0%
to a grand jury and ask for
um

04:32:50.870 --> 04:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:53.630 --> 04:32:53.640 align:start position:0%
ask for charges without saying hey we've
 
04:32:55.670 --> 04:32:55.680 align:start position:0%
gone with this evidence this exact same
 
04:32:59.149 --> 04:32:59.159 align:start position:0%
evidence over to the grand jury and ask
 
04:32:59.159 --> 04:33:00.349 align:start position:0%
evidence over to the grand jury and ask
for

04:33:00.349 --> 04:33:00.359 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:33:04.131 --> 04:33:04.141 align:start position:0%
um the the charges that way to kind of
 
04:33:06.769 --> 04:33:06.779 align:start position:0%
circumvent the um
 
04:33:11.090 --> 04:33:11.100 align:start position:0%
the judge's decision without and and be
 
04:33:13.310 --> 04:33:13.320 align:start position:0%
able to do that without those the grand
 
04:33:16.131 --> 04:33:16.141 align:start position:0%
jury knowing that that was the case so
 
04:33:21.590 --> 04:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:24.349 --> 04:33:24.359 align:start position:0%
representative Pro
 
04:33:29.330 --> 04:33:29.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:31.730 --> 04:33:31.740 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:33:33.230 --> 04:33:33.240 align:start position:0%
um I don't have I don't have that
 
04:33:35.929 --> 04:33:35.939 align:start position:0%
statistics for you but more than zero
 
04:33:37.970 --> 04:33:37.980 align:start position:0%
times and that's what's of concern to me
 
04:33:39.070 --> 04:33:39.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:33:42.109 --> 04:33:42.119 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
04:33:44.869 --> 04:33:44.879 align:start position:0%
have you ever heard of it happening yes
 
04:33:48.890 --> 04:33:48.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:50.390 --> 04:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
04:33:54.051 --> 04:33:54.061 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:57.470 --> 04:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:00.830 --> 04:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
I'm aware of at least one time and that
 
04:34:00.840 --> 04:34:01.789 align:start position:0%
I'm aware of at least one time and that
is

04:34:01.789 --> 04:34:01.799 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:34:05.390 --> 04:34:05.400 align:start position:0%
enough for enough of uh abuse of power
 
04:34:06.529 --> 04:34:06.539 align:start position:0%
for me
 
04:34:10.789 --> 04:34:10.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:13.250 --> 04:34:13.260 align:start position:0%
representative Newman
 
04:34:14.869 --> 04:34:14.879 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm just kind of scanning over
 
04:34:17.209 --> 04:34:17.219 align:start position:0%
the language here and I and I read uh
 
04:34:19.250 --> 04:34:19.260 align:start position:0%
paragraph number two
 
04:34:21.170 --> 04:34:21.180 align:start position:0%
and I'm just curious it talks about
 
04:34:24.650 --> 04:34:24.660 align:start position:0%
having one one uh request and then you
 
04:34:27.410 --> 04:34:27.420 align:start position:0%
submit another request does the first
 
04:34:29.150 --> 04:34:29.160 align:start position:0%
one have to be completed and adjudicated
 
04:34:32.150 --> 04:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
and denied or or could this be happening
 
04:34:34.789 --> 04:34:34.799 align:start position:0%
simultaneously that they're going to one
 
04:34:36.590 --> 04:34:36.600 align:start position:0%
or more judges
 
04:34:38.631 --> 04:34:38.641 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:34:41.269 --> 04:34:41.279 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure the reason why they
 
04:34:44.209 --> 04:34:44.219 align:start position:0%
would be asking for multiple uh
 
04:34:46.250 --> 04:34:46.260 align:start position:0%
for the exact same person based on the
 
04:34:48.410 --> 04:34:48.420 align:start position:0%
same evidence as if you're either gonna
 
04:34:50.689 --> 04:34:50.699 align:start position:0%
arrest them or not but
 
04:34:53.209 --> 04:34:53.219 align:start position:0%
um I don't think that this language will
 
04:34:55.490 --> 04:34:55.500 align:start position:0%
require you to disclose that you've
 
04:34:57.890 --> 04:34:57.900 align:start position:0%
requested it four times
 
04:35:00.709 --> 04:35:00.719 align:start position:0%
um but you have not received any answer
 
04:35:03.051 --> 04:35:03.061 align:start position:0%
back because maybe they want maybe that
 
04:35:05.029 --> 04:35:05.039 align:start position:0%
judge is let's say not responsive or
 
04:35:07.670 --> 04:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
whatever and they wanted to to talk to
 
04:35:09.410 --> 04:35:09.420 align:start position:0%
someone that would be more responsive if
 
04:35:11.150 --> 04:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
they haven't made a decision yet then I
 
04:35:12.650 --> 04:35:12.660 align:start position:0%
don't see any reason why they would need
 
04:35:14.269 --> 04:35:14.279 align:start position:0%
to this
 
04:35:18.650 --> 04:35:18.660 align:start position:0%
um this is only saying that they um
 
04:35:18.660 --> 04:35:31.609 align:start position:0%
um this is only saying that they um
uh

04:35:31.609 --> 04:35:31.619 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:34.250 --> 04:35:34.260 align:start position:0%
um so a
 
04:35:34.260 --> 04:35:35.090 align:start position:0%
um so a
um

04:35:35.090 --> 04:35:35.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:38.990 --> 04:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:39.000 --> 04:35:40.609 align:start position:0%
 
right

04:35:40.609 --> 04:35:40.619 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:35:40.619 --> 04:35:41.510 align:start position:0%
right
um

04:35:41.510 --> 04:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:43.631 --> 04:35:43.641 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that the language is
 
04:35:46.310 --> 04:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
reading it with your kind of your your
 
04:35:47.869 --> 04:35:47.879 align:start position:0%
question in mind I'm not sure that it's
 
04:35:50.510 --> 04:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
100 clear that because it does talk
 
04:35:53.209 --> 04:35:53.219 align:start position:0%
about pending requests and you can you
 
04:35:56.090 --> 04:35:56.100 align:start position:0%
just uh a state that dates that the
 
04:35:58.670 --> 04:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
prior request was
 
04:36:00.410 --> 04:36:00.420 align:start position:0%
um like the data for the request the
 
04:36:02.390 --> 04:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
judge that reviewed it and the
 
04:36:03.890 --> 04:36:03.900 align:start position:0%
particular evidence submitted and
 
04:36:05.269 --> 04:36:05.279 align:start position:0%
whether or not the search warrant was
 
04:36:08.029 --> 04:36:08.039 align:start position:0%
granted based on such evidence it
 
04:36:12.650 --> 04:36:12.660 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to say that you shouldn't
 
04:36:15.769 --> 04:36:15.779 align:start position:0%
necessarily be required to disclose that
 
04:36:17.689 --> 04:36:17.699 align:start position:0%
it was previously requested if you in
 
04:36:19.310 --> 04:36:19.320 align:start position:0%
the example that I gave if you requested
 
04:36:20.750 --> 04:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
four times
 
04:36:23.810 --> 04:36:23.820 align:start position:0%
all listing all four but maybe they
 
04:36:25.789 --> 04:36:25.799 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have the
 
04:36:29.209 --> 04:36:29.219 align:start position:0%
um the whether or not it was decided
 
04:36:31.070 --> 04:36:31.080 align:start position:0%
that last
 
04:36:33.410 --> 04:36:33.420 align:start position:0%
um factoid I guess that's that's listed
 
04:36:35.090 --> 04:36:35.100 align:start position:0%
in that sentence wouldn't be included
 
04:36:36.709 --> 04:36:36.719 align:start position:0%
because you wouldn't have the answer to
 
04:36:36.719 --> 04:36:37.910 align:start position:0%
because you wouldn't have the answer to
that

04:36:37.910 --> 04:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:36:39.709 --> 04:36:39.719 align:start position:0%
um but
 
04:36:42.349 --> 04:36:42.359 align:start position:0%
so I don't I'm not sure that it's clear
 
04:36:45.109 --> 04:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
that you don't have to but I I would not
 
04:36:46.970 --> 04:36:46.980 align:start position:0%
be opposed to them having to say like
 
04:36:48.890 --> 04:36:48.900 align:start position:0%
yeah we requested it four times I'm not
 
04:36:51.650 --> 04:36:51.660 align:start position:0%
sure why they would ever do that though
 
04:36:54.349 --> 04:36:54.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for your answer yeah
 
04:36:58.010 --> 04:36:58.020 align:start position:0%
I I have a question um I'm looking at
 
04:37:03.529 --> 04:37:03.539 align:start position:0%
line 24 and 25 about the thousand dollar
 
04:37:07.551 --> 04:37:07.561 align:start position:0%
fine would that be to
 
04:37:10.369 --> 04:37:10.379 align:start position:0%
you know the department as a whole would
 
04:37:13.369 --> 04:37:13.379 align:start position:0%
it be to the to the officer in charge
 
04:37:16.010 --> 04:37:16.020 align:start position:0%
exactly what does that how does that how
 
04:37:18.529 --> 04:37:18.539 align:start position:0%
would that come into effect
 
04:37:20.689 --> 04:37:20.699 align:start position:0%
so the
 
04:37:23.631 --> 04:37:23.641 align:start position:0%
the the uh it would be the law
 
04:37:25.490 --> 04:37:25.500 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer that was violating
 
04:37:28.970 --> 04:37:28.980 align:start position:0%
it right so on if you say like
 
04:37:31.551 --> 04:37:31.561 align:start position:0%
um line 11
 
04:37:34.131 --> 04:37:34.141 align:start position:0%
it's it's the lawn law enforcement
 
04:37:39.051 --> 04:37:39.061 align:start position:0%
officer or the agency so so whoever is
 
04:37:41.689 --> 04:37:41.699 align:start position:0%
the official like requesting it so if
 
04:37:44.150 --> 04:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
it's coming from the agency I guess that
 
04:37:47.689 --> 04:37:47.699 align:start position:0%
would that would be able to be not the
 
04:37:50.510 --> 04:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
actual person but I don't think that
 
04:37:52.310 --> 04:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
um I think it's more of the officer
 
04:37:54.830 --> 04:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
that's that's requesting it in on behalf
 
04:37:57.410 --> 04:37:57.420 align:start position:0%
of the agency and not the actual agency
 
04:38:00.410 --> 04:38:00.420 align:start position:0%
requesting it but I'm sure officers will
 
04:38:02.570 --> 04:38:02.580 align:start position:0%
be able to tell you as far as that but
 
04:38:06.051 --> 04:38:06.061 align:start position:0%
my intention is just that if the officer
 
04:38:09.830 --> 04:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
is knowingly violating the law
 
04:38:12.289 --> 04:38:12.299 align:start position:0%
um that they get they get punished so if
 
04:38:14.570 --> 04:38:14.580 align:start position:0%
they don't know that that the that the
 
04:38:16.369 --> 04:38:16.379 align:start position:0%
information was
 
04:38:18.529 --> 04:38:18.539 align:start position:0%
um previously used then they shouldn't
 
04:38:20.510 --> 04:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
be held accountable but if they are
 
04:38:22.369 --> 04:38:22.379 align:start position:0%
knowingly violating the law it should be
 
04:38:25.730 --> 04:38:25.740 align:start position:0%
uh should be uh held accountable for
 
04:38:29.269 --> 04:38:29.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:31.789 --> 04:38:31.799 align:start position:0%
representative Newell
 
04:38:33.349 --> 04:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
thank you madam Sharon thank you my
 
04:38:36.109 --> 04:38:36.119 align:start position:0%
question so I think the way that I'm
 
04:38:38.090 --> 04:38:38.100 align:start position:0%
reading it and correct me if I'm wrong
 
04:38:40.131 --> 04:38:40.141 align:start position:0%
um this would be using this if it were
 
04:38:42.349 --> 04:38:42.359 align:start position:0%
using the same information
 
04:38:43.910 --> 04:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
um the judge who would be approving the
 
04:38:45.230 --> 04:38:45.240 align:start position:0%
arrest warrant would know that as well
 
04:38:48.650 --> 04:38:48.660 align:start position:0%
right so this wouldn't just be I mean
 
04:38:51.289 --> 04:38:51.299 align:start position:0%
I would think that this would be beyond
 
04:38:52.849 --> 04:38:52.859 align:start position:0%
the officer themselves is what I'm
 
04:38:54.769 --> 04:38:54.779 align:start position:0%
saying so it's putting all the liability
 
04:38:57.650 --> 04:38:57.660 align:start position:0%
on the officer but it seems in order for
 
04:38:59.631 --> 04:38:59.641 align:start position:0%
this to for something like this to
 
04:38:59.641 --> 04:39:00.949 align:start position:0%
this to for something like this to
happen

04:39:00.949 --> 04:39:00.959 align:start position:0%
happen
 
04:39:03.230 --> 04:39:03.240 align:start position:0%
um it would kind of have to go through a
 
04:39:07.070 --> 04:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
few different people at that point
 
04:39:09.590 --> 04:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so
 
04:39:14.090 --> 04:39:14.100 align:start position:0%
in so like judge shopping is what is
 
04:39:16.070 --> 04:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
kind of what what we're talking about is
 
04:39:17.929 --> 04:39:17.939 align:start position:0%
like if you if the law enforcement
 
04:39:20.869 --> 04:39:20.879 align:start position:0%
officers goes to judge a and the judge a
 
04:39:23.390 --> 04:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
says this is not appropriate or you
 
04:39:25.010 --> 04:39:25.020 align:start position:0%
don't have enough evidence go get more
 
04:39:27.470 --> 04:39:27.480 align:start position:0%
evidence and then they use the exact
 
04:39:29.990 --> 04:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
same information and go to judge B
 
04:39:31.310 --> 04:39:31.320 align:start position:0%
I guess maybe this would be a question
 
04:39:33.289 --> 04:39:33.299 align:start position:0%
for somebody else but you know for oh
 
04:39:35.209 --> 04:39:35.219 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry okay sorry
 
04:39:36.051 --> 04:39:36.061 align:start position:0%
um but
 
04:39:37.670 --> 04:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
there would be a record of that right
 
04:39:39.350 --> 04:39:39.360 align:start position:0%
you would follow the the process would
 
04:39:40.670 --> 04:39:40.680 align:start position:0%
be there would be a record of that
 
04:39:42.708 --> 04:39:42.718 align:start position:0%
process so judge shopping I would think
 
04:39:45.410 --> 04:39:45.420 align:start position:0%
would be pretty difficult because it
 
04:39:47.810 --> 04:39:47.820 align:start position:0%
would be on file that you had brought
 
04:39:49.430 --> 04:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
the same evidence to the same person
 
04:39:52.190 --> 04:39:52.200 align:start position:0%
what I'm what I'm trying to get at is in
 
04:39:53.570 --> 04:39:53.580 align:start position:0%
order for something like this to
 
04:39:56.448 --> 04:39:56.458 align:start position:0%
actually happen and accomplish what you
 
04:39:59.390 --> 04:39:59.400 align:start position:0%
know if if someone had ill intent then
 
04:40:01.850 --> 04:40:01.860 align:start position:0%
in order for them to do that I feel like
 
04:40:04.070 --> 04:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
there would be checks before that in
 
04:40:06.170 --> 04:40:06.180 align:start position:0%
order for that I'm sorry I'm not I'm not
 
04:40:08.990 --> 04:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
posing the question right
 
04:40:13.610 --> 04:40:13.620 align:start position:0%
I I'm sorry I mean wouldn't these things
 
04:40:15.708 --> 04:40:15.718 align:start position:0%
be on record so that this wouldn't be
 
04:40:17.630 --> 04:40:17.640 align:start position:0%
able to happen is my question thank you
 
04:40:19.070 --> 04:40:19.080 align:start position:0%
for the question
 
04:40:21.410 --> 04:40:21.420 align:start position:0%
um so we're when I'm talking about
 
04:40:22.850 --> 04:40:22.860 align:start position:0%
different judges that it wouldn't
 
04:40:24.590 --> 04:40:24.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily be this they wouldn't have
 
04:40:26.150 --> 04:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
the knowledge because you would be going
 
04:40:28.730 --> 04:40:28.740 align:start position:0%
to judge a versus judge B and so they
 
04:40:30.350 --> 04:40:30.360 align:start position:0%
wouldn't necessarily have talked to each
 
04:40:32.448 --> 04:40:32.458 align:start position:0%
other about that those different
 
04:40:32.458 --> 04:40:34.070 align:start position:0%
other about that those different
requests

04:40:34.070 --> 04:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
requests
 
04:40:37.010 --> 04:40:37.020 align:start position:0%
um however there is new technology
 
04:40:39.170 --> 04:40:39.180 align:start position:0%
getting put in that that they're
 
04:40:41.410 --> 04:40:41.420 align:start position:0%
requesting these more and more through
 
04:40:44.470 --> 04:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
online portals and those
 
04:40:48.350 --> 04:40:48.360 align:start position:0%
would essentially have some record of
 
04:40:50.270 --> 04:40:50.280 align:start position:0%
the request being made but wouldn't
 
04:40:50.280 --> 04:40:52.368 align:start position:0%
the request being made but wouldn't
necessarily

04:40:52.368 --> 04:40:52.378 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
04:40:52.378 --> 04:40:53.150 align:start position:0%
necessarily
um

04:40:53.150 --> 04:40:53.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:56.448 --> 04:40:56.458 align:start position:0%
may not document like what the actual
 
04:40:59.630 --> 04:40:59.640 align:start position:0%
evidence was and so
 
04:41:01.910 --> 04:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
um really it's the requesting officer
 
04:41:04.010 --> 04:41:04.020 align:start position:0%
that would know like this is I I
 
04:41:06.170 --> 04:41:06.180 align:start position:0%
requested this because I'm kind of the
 
04:41:08.030 --> 04:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
lead on this case I've requested this
 
04:41:10.368 --> 04:41:10.378 align:start position:0%
with this information and then I've
 
04:41:12.830 --> 04:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
requested it again with the the same
 
04:41:15.830 --> 04:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
information so okay thank you
 
04:41:18.110 --> 04:41:18.120 align:start position:0%
representative Manion
 
04:41:19.550 --> 04:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
thank you madam sure thank you for
 
04:41:21.530 --> 04:41:21.540 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:41:23.090 --> 04:41:23.100 align:start position:0%
I've been in law enforcement for some
 
04:41:24.650 --> 04:41:24.660 align:start position:0%
time and I'm a little bit confused as to
 
04:41:26.330 --> 04:41:26.340 align:start position:0%
how this could happen
 
04:41:28.310 --> 04:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
would you be able to speak to that one
 
04:41:30.230 --> 04:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
specific incident about the facts of
 
04:41:31.550 --> 04:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
that so I can understand how this could
 
04:41:35.570 --> 04:41:35.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:37.368 --> 04:41:37.378 align:start position:0%
um I think there will be other testimony
 
04:41:41.030 --> 04:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
here today that that would be more
 
04:41:43.368 --> 04:41:43.378 align:start position:0%
helpful as far as the line that line of
 
04:41:43.378 --> 04:41:47.270 align:start position:0%
helpful as far as the line that line of
questioning

04:41:47.270 --> 04:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:50.690 --> 04:41:50.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:52.910 --> 04:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
Sharon thank you for taking my question
 
04:41:52.920 --> 04:41:54.590 align:start position:0%
Sharon thank you for taking my question
uh

04:41:54.590 --> 04:41:54.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:41:56.868 --> 04:41:56.878 align:start position:0%
specifically in law right now
 
04:41:56.878 --> 04:41:58.250 align:start position:0%
specifically in law right now
um

04:41:58.250 --> 04:41:58.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:00.410 --> 04:42:00.420 align:start position:0%
is we're not talking about just Circuit
 
04:42:02.708 --> 04:42:02.718 align:start position:0%
Court judges issuing warrants
 
04:42:05.208 --> 04:42:05.218 align:start position:0%
justices of the peace can do that so how
 
04:42:11.090 --> 04:42:11.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:14.510 --> 04:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I believe
 
04:42:14.520 --> 04:42:15.650 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I believe
that

04:42:15.650 --> 04:42:15.660 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:42:18.230 --> 04:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
whether they're requesting it from a
 
04:42:19.670 --> 04:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
Justice of the piece or they're
 
04:42:21.230 --> 04:42:21.240 align:start position:0%
requesting it
 
04:42:23.628 --> 04:42:23.638 align:start position:0%
through the Circuit Court I think the
 
04:42:26.510 --> 04:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
requirement is the same for the law
 
04:42:30.590 --> 04:42:30.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement to notify those people
 
04:42:32.810 --> 04:42:32.820 align:start position:0%
either way
 
04:42:37.010 --> 04:42:37.020 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes thank you um so I think
 
04:42:39.590 --> 04:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
what I'm driving at is if you're dealing
 
04:42:41.208 --> 04:42:41.218 align:start position:0%
with a police officer dealing uh
 
04:42:42.830 --> 04:42:42.840 align:start position:0%
interacting with the justice of the
 
04:42:45.650 --> 04:42:45.660 align:start position:0%
peace that is not uh using electronic
 
04:42:48.910 --> 04:42:48.920 align:start position:0%
means they're not at the Circuit Court
 
04:42:51.288 --> 04:42:51.298 align:start position:0%
they're not Circuit Court judges they're
 
04:42:53.690 --> 04:42:53.700 align:start position:0%
talking to each other all the time and
 
04:42:54.830 --> 04:42:54.840 align:start position:0%
you're talking about a Justice of the
 
04:42:57.350 --> 04:42:57.360 align:start position:0%
Peace sitting at home so
 
04:43:01.670 --> 04:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
how would you know that a police officer
 
04:43:03.890 --> 04:43:03.900 align:start position:0%
had gone to several justices of the
 
04:43:05.390 --> 04:43:05.400 align:start position:0%
piece rather than going to the circuit
 
04:43:06.890 --> 04:43:06.900 align:start position:0%
court judge
 
04:43:09.410 --> 04:43:09.420 align:start position:0%
I think that thank you for the question
 
04:43:11.868 --> 04:43:11.878 align:start position:0%
I think that would be
 
04:43:15.730 --> 04:43:15.740 align:start position:0%
um something that uh
 
04:43:20.690 --> 04:43:20.700 align:start position:0%
would require investigations and and
 
04:43:23.750 --> 04:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
um may not always may not always become
 
04:43:26.208 --> 04:43:26.218 align:start position:0%
apparent unless
 
04:43:26.218 --> 04:43:27.590 align:start position:0%
apparent unless
um

04:43:27.590 --> 04:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:30.230 --> 04:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
unless someone was doing some research
 
04:43:33.230 --> 04:43:33.240 align:start position:0%
and and knew
 
04:43:35.930 --> 04:43:35.940 align:start position:0%
um let's say that they knew the Justice
 
04:43:38.570 --> 04:43:38.580 align:start position:0%
of the pieces or something like that
 
04:43:41.090 --> 04:43:41.100 align:start position:0%
um they wouldn't there would need to be
 
04:43:42.590 --> 04:43:42.600 align:start position:0%
an investigation I don't think that you
 
04:43:44.090 --> 04:43:44.100 align:start position:0%
would just know
 
04:43:44.100 --> 04:43:45.070 align:start position:0%
would just know
um

04:43:45.070 --> 04:43:45.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:48.590 --> 04:43:48.600 align:start position:0%
and so you would have to bring that that
 
04:43:53.390 --> 04:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
evidence to the the D.A to to charge
 
04:43:55.670 --> 04:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
or or the D.A do with the investigation
 
04:44:02.990 --> 04:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:05.570 --> 04:44:05.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:23.030 --> 04:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:24.650 --> 04:44:24.660 align:start position:0%
there you go
 
04:44:26.288 --> 04:44:26.298 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:44:28.730 --> 04:44:28.740 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you madam chairman
 
04:44:30.288 --> 04:44:30.298 align:start position:0%
members committee thanks for allowing me
 
04:44:32.868 --> 04:44:32.878 align:start position:0%
to speak here my name is Jason Smith I'm
 
04:44:34.610 --> 04:44:34.620 align:start position:0%
a captain with the Salem Police
 
04:44:36.110 --> 04:44:36.120 align:start position:0%
Department I've been full-time officer
 
04:44:39.590 --> 04:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire for over 25 years and
 
04:44:41.750 --> 04:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
um the nhpa the New Hampshire Police
 
04:44:43.070 --> 04:44:43.080 align:start position:0%
Association asked me to speak on this
 
04:44:46.250 --> 04:44:46.260 align:start position:0%
bill today and that is why I'm here I
 
04:44:48.230 --> 04:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
believe this bill's attempting to solve
 
04:44:50.510 --> 04:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
a problem that does not exist in this
 
04:44:50.520 --> 04:44:51.550 align:start position:0%
a problem that does not exist in this
state

04:44:51.550 --> 04:44:51.560 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:44:56.150 --> 04:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
the proposed language to amend RSA 595-8
 
04:44:57.530 --> 04:44:57.540 align:start position:0%
colon two
 
04:44:59.448 --> 04:44:59.458 align:start position:0%
the requisites of Lawrence statue and
 
04:45:03.110 --> 04:45:03.120 align:start position:0%
RSA 592-a colon 8 is problematic in a
 
04:45:05.270 --> 04:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
number of ways the proposed paragraph
 
04:45:05.280 --> 04:45:06.470 align:start position:0%
number of ways the proposed paragraph
two

04:45:06.470 --> 04:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
two
 
04:45:08.570 --> 04:45:08.580 align:start position:0%
of the requisites of a warrant statute
 
04:45:11.510 --> 04:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
States the law enforcement officer or
 
04:45:13.788 --> 04:45:13.798 align:start position:0%
law enforcement agency requesting the
 
04:45:15.230 --> 04:45:15.240 align:start position:0%
search warrant
 
04:45:15.240 --> 04:45:16.430 align:start position:0%
search warrant
well

04:45:16.430 --> 04:45:16.440 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:45:18.410 --> 04:45:18.420 align:start position:0%
that's in direct contradiction
 
04:45:22.730 --> 04:45:22.740 align:start position:0%
to RSA 595 A4 written statement under
 
04:45:24.288 --> 04:45:24.298 align:start position:0%
oath in support of application for
 
04:45:26.510 --> 04:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
Warrant it states a person seeking a
 
04:45:28.850 --> 04:45:28.860 align:start position:0%
search warrant shall appear before a
 
04:45:30.890 --> 04:45:30.900 align:start position:0%
court of justice it speaks nothing about
 
04:45:33.770 --> 04:45:33.780 align:start position:0%
an agency every arrest warrant and every
 
04:45:35.810 --> 04:45:35.820 align:start position:0%
search warrant that is applied for in
 
04:45:37.788 --> 04:45:37.798 align:start position:0%
this state and granted is done by one
 
04:45:39.830 --> 04:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
officer there's not a team of officers
 
04:45:41.868 --> 04:45:41.878 align:start position:0%
there's not an agency why is that
 
04:45:44.510 --> 04:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
problematic well excuse me it's
 
04:45:46.730 --> 04:45:46.740 align:start position:0%
problematic because the language is now
 
04:45:48.890 --> 04:45:48.900 align:start position:0%
making it sound like the entire breadth
 
04:45:51.410 --> 04:45:51.420 align:start position:0%
of the agency has knowledge that one
 
04:45:53.868 --> 04:45:53.878 align:start position:0%
officer may or may not have
 
04:45:56.570 --> 04:45:56.580 align:start position:0%
so are we going to punish an officer for
 
04:45:57.948 --> 04:45:57.958 align:start position:0%
something another officer may know that
 
04:45:59.930 --> 04:45:59.940 align:start position:0%
didn't tell him if the agency knew it we
 
04:46:01.250 --> 04:46:01.260 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
04:46:01.260 --> 04:46:06.890 align:start position:0%
don't know
um

04:46:06.890 --> 04:46:06.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:08.570 --> 04:46:08.580 align:start position:0%
and then it talks about they shall
 
04:46:10.250 --> 04:46:10.260 align:start position:0%
disclose exculpatory evidence who is
 
04:46:10.260 --> 04:46:11.030 align:start position:0%
disclose exculpatory evidence who is
they

04:46:11.030 --> 04:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
they
 
04:46:13.910 --> 04:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
the agency how can the agency ex
 
04:46:15.410 --> 04:46:15.420 align:start position:0%
um how can the agency put out
 
04:46:16.788 --> 04:46:16.798 align:start position:0%
exculpatory evidence when they're not
 
04:46:18.650 --> 04:46:18.660 align:start position:0%
giving out the evidence it's only a
 
04:46:20.628 --> 04:46:20.638 align:start position:0%
single officer so that's a problem with
 
04:46:22.310 --> 04:46:22.320 align:start position:0%
the statute itself it's flying in the
 
04:46:23.990 --> 04:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
face of how the search warrants and
 
04:46:26.390 --> 04:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
arrest warrant process works
 
04:46:26.400 --> 04:46:28.610 align:start position:0%
arrest warrant process works
um

04:46:28.610 --> 04:46:28.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:31.368 --> 04:46:31.378 align:start position:0%
this also applies to RSA 592 A8 under
 
04:46:32.830 --> 04:46:32.840 align:start position:0%
the warrants
 
04:46:35.690 --> 04:46:35.700 align:start position:0%
that only one officer will sign out a
 
04:46:38.448 --> 04:46:38.458 align:start position:0%
warrant so next the definition of
 
04:46:40.730 --> 04:46:40.740 align:start position:0%
exculpatory evidence does not exist in
 
04:46:43.010 --> 04:46:43.020 align:start position:0%
the RSA code we all know that
 
04:46:44.628 --> 04:46:44.638 align:start position:0%
exculpatory evidence is evidence that
 
04:46:46.910 --> 04:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
tends to show that a individual charge
 
04:46:49.850 --> 04:46:49.860 align:start position:0%
with a crime did not commit the crime
 
04:46:51.650 --> 04:46:51.660 align:start position:0%
we know that but it means different
 
04:46:53.030 --> 04:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
things to different people it means
 
04:46:55.310 --> 04:46:55.320 align:start position:0%
different things to a police officer to
 
04:46:57.830 --> 04:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
a prosecutor to a defense lawyer to a
 
04:46:59.448 --> 04:46:59.458 align:start position:0%
judge into a jury
 
04:47:01.430 --> 04:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
so how are we going to expect an officer
 
04:47:03.470 --> 04:47:03.480 align:start position:0%
to know what is exculpatory evidence
 
04:47:05.448 --> 04:47:05.458 align:start position:0%
when we don't even Define it it's not
 
04:47:07.970 --> 04:47:07.980 align:start position:0%
defined anywhere in the statute
 
04:47:10.970 --> 04:47:10.980 align:start position:0%
and what I mean by that is I've had to
 
04:47:12.590 --> 04:47:12.600 align:start position:0%
sit through many trials
 
04:47:14.990 --> 04:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
and I've watched as a police prosecutor
 
04:47:17.750 --> 04:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
for many years members on the defense
 
04:47:21.350 --> 04:47:21.360 align:start position:0%
side ask questions of officers or of me
 
04:47:22.910 --> 04:47:22.920 align:start position:0%
while I'm giving testimony in a case
 
04:47:26.090 --> 04:47:26.100 align:start position:0%
that they believe is exculpatory that I
 
04:47:28.910 --> 04:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
know or I believe is not so now it's
 
04:47:28.920 --> 04:47:30.230 align:start position:0%
know or I believe is not so now it's
subjective

04:47:30.230 --> 04:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
subjective
 
04:47:32.930 --> 04:47:32.940 align:start position:0%
so now we're going to punish officers
 
04:47:35.208 --> 04:47:35.218 align:start position:0%
for a subjective definition of
 
04:47:36.590 --> 04:47:36.600 align:start position:0%
exculpatory evidence because we haven't
 
04:47:39.050 --> 04:47:39.060 align:start position:0%
bothered to Define it in the statute
 
04:47:39.060 --> 04:47:40.010 align:start position:0%
bothered to Define it in the statute
um

04:47:40.010 --> 04:47:40.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:40.020 --> 04:47:41.750 align:start position:0%
um
so

04:47:41.750 --> 04:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:47:43.850 --> 04:47:43.860 align:start position:0%
will the verbal protestations of a
 
04:47:45.830 --> 04:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
criminal defendant that the pants he was
 
04:47:47.208 --> 04:47:47.218 align:start position:0%
wearing that we seized for a search
 
04:47:50.090 --> 04:47:50.100 align:start position:0%
warrant were not his is that exculpatory
 
04:47:51.470 --> 04:47:51.480 align:start position:0%
do we have to put that in a search
 
04:47:53.390 --> 04:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
warrant and if we don't or do we face a
 
04:47:55.010 --> 04:47:55.020 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar fine
 
04:47:57.530 --> 04:47:57.540 align:start position:0%
if a person of witnessed victim or
 
04:48:00.890 --> 04:48:00.900 align:start position:0%
suspect was crying or failed to cry
 
04:48:02.570 --> 04:48:02.580 align:start position:0%
while giving a statement to the police
 
04:48:05.090 --> 04:48:05.100 align:start position:0%
is that exculpatory because a defense
 
04:48:07.310 --> 04:48:07.320 align:start position:0%
lawyer would argue that the lack of or
 
04:48:09.410 --> 04:48:09.420 align:start position:0%
showing of emotion could be exculpatory
 
04:48:10.670 --> 04:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
depending on the facts of each specific
 
04:48:13.670 --> 04:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
case is that exculpatory we don't know
 
04:48:15.770 --> 04:48:15.780 align:start position:0%
the purpose of an affidavit or a
 
04:48:18.170 --> 04:48:18.180 align:start position:0%
statement of probable cause is simply to
 
04:48:20.628 --> 04:48:20.638 align:start position:0%
outline whether probable cause exists to
 
04:48:22.010 --> 04:48:22.020 align:start position:0%
conduct a search or to arrest the
 
04:48:23.690 --> 04:48:23.700 align:start position:0%
defendant everything else that has to do
 
04:48:25.190 --> 04:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
with exculpatory evidence occurs
 
04:48:28.788 --> 04:48:28.798 align:start position:0%
post-arrest it occurs during the defense
 
04:48:32.150 --> 04:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
council's attempt to mitigate or to
 
04:48:34.670 --> 04:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
prove not guilty a criminal defendant it
 
04:48:36.708 --> 04:48:36.718 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with law enforcement
 
04:48:39.170 --> 04:48:39.180 align:start position:0%
in the investigation of a crime I'm not
 
04:48:41.208 --> 04:48:41.218 align:start position:0%
saying we ignore exculpatory evidence of
 
04:48:43.070 --> 04:48:43.080 align:start position:0%
course we document it of course we make
 
04:48:44.628 --> 04:48:44.638 align:start position:0%
notes of the protestations of Defense
 
04:48:44.638 --> 04:48:45.948 align:start position:0%
notes of the protestations of Defense
but

04:48:45.948 --> 04:48:45.958 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:48:48.470 --> 04:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
to say there's going to be a fine is
 
04:48:50.628 --> 04:48:50.638 align:start position:0%
going to have a chilling effect on
 
04:48:52.070 --> 04:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
officers going forward trying to get
 
04:48:53.390 --> 04:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
search warrants and arrest warrants
 
04:48:55.788 --> 04:48:55.798 align:start position:0%
because they're going to be is it worth
 
04:48:57.350 --> 04:48:57.360 align:start position:0%
it I don't know maybe this is
 
04:48:58.850 --> 04:48:58.860 align:start position:0%
exculpatory maybe it's not now I'm going
 
04:49:00.050 --> 04:49:00.060 align:start position:0%
to delay what I'm doing to talk to a
 
04:49:01.730 --> 04:49:01.740 align:start position:0%
supervisor or an attorney
 
04:49:03.350 --> 04:49:03.360 align:start position:0%
before they even go for that warrant
 
04:49:05.448 --> 04:49:05.458 align:start position:0%
where in the past they would just go and
 
04:49:06.590 --> 04:49:06.600 align:start position:0%
get the arrest warrant or the search
 
04:49:08.570 --> 04:49:08.580 align:start position:0%
warrant or apply for the search warrant
 
04:49:11.868 --> 04:49:11.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:15.230 --> 04:49:15.240 align:start position:0%
um the Brady rule requires prosecutors
 
04:49:17.628 --> 04:49:17.638 align:start position:0%
to turn over any exculpatory evidence
 
04:49:19.730 --> 04:49:19.740 align:start position:0%
they're aware of if it's a long-standing
 
04:49:21.288 --> 04:49:21.298 align:start position:0%
federal practice and it applies in the
 
04:49:23.930 --> 04:49:23.940 align:start position:0%
state even if that exculpatory evidence
 
04:49:26.570 --> 04:49:26.580 align:start position:0%
is evidence that they're not aware of
 
04:49:28.610 --> 04:49:28.620 align:start position:0%
through the normal Discovery process for
 
04:49:30.230 --> 04:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
example they get proof that an officer
 
04:49:32.330 --> 04:49:32.340 align:start position:0%
was lying they're required to provide
 
04:49:34.430 --> 04:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
that evidence I would argue the same is
 
04:49:35.628 --> 04:49:35.638 align:start position:0%
for a police officer they're required to
 
04:49:36.788 --> 04:49:36.798 align:start position:0%
give that evidence
 
04:49:38.990 --> 04:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
there's no Provisions in this statute
 
04:49:40.970 --> 04:49:40.980 align:start position:0%
for an emergency what do I mean by that
 
04:49:43.128 --> 04:49:43.138 align:start position:0%
we could have an individual who's been
 
04:49:45.530 --> 04:49:45.540 align:start position:0%
the subject of multiple ongoing criminal
 
04:49:47.330 --> 04:49:47.340 align:start position:0%
investigations who's out on or he's
 
04:49:49.368 --> 04:49:49.378 align:start position:0%
released on PR bail and there's an
 
04:49:51.288 --> 04:49:51.298 align:start position:0%
emergency situation and we're outside
 
04:49:52.788 --> 04:49:52.798 align:start position:0%
his home and we need to get a search
 
04:49:54.050 --> 04:49:54.060 align:start position:0%
warrant to go in
 
04:49:55.788 --> 04:49:55.798 align:start position:0%
and some of the facts of that case are
 
04:49:57.470 --> 04:49:57.480 align:start position:0%
going to be related to Prior cases that
 
04:49:58.850 --> 04:49:58.860 align:start position:0%
we're already doing
 
04:50:01.310 --> 04:50:01.320 align:start position:0%
it's midnight it's 2 A.M we got to get a
 
04:50:03.170 --> 04:50:03.180 align:start position:0%
search warrant to get in there is that
 
04:50:04.788 --> 04:50:04.798 align:start position:0%
midnight officer that's working on a
 
04:50:05.930 --> 04:50:05.940 align:start position:0%
search warrant gonna have to call in
 
04:50:08.570 --> 04:50:08.580 align:start position:0%
that officer and scan his brain to
 
04:50:10.010 --> 04:50:10.020 align:start position:0%
figure out everything in custody of the
 
04:50:12.410 --> 04:50:12.420 align:start position:0%
agency that might be exculpatory or with
 
04:50:14.030 --> 04:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
the dates and times of Prior search
 
04:50:15.590 --> 04:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
warrants or arrest warrants it doesn't
 
04:50:18.230 --> 04:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
make sense all it's going to do is delay
 
04:50:21.110 --> 04:50:21.120 align:start position:0%
what could be an emergency situation
 
04:50:21.120 --> 04:50:22.128 align:start position:0%
what could be an emergency situation
um

04:50:22.128 --> 04:50:22.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:23.930 --> 04:50:23.940 align:start position:0%
and finally
 
04:50:25.788 --> 04:50:25.798 align:start position:0%
who determines what a violation of this
 
04:50:26.990 --> 04:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
chapter is
 
04:50:28.628 --> 04:50:28.638 align:start position:0%
the the
 
04:50:30.708 --> 04:50:30.718 align:start position:0%
member that
 
04:50:33.708 --> 04:50:33.718 align:start position:0%
just spoke before me I I don't recall
 
04:50:35.030 --> 04:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
his name at the moment talked about
 
04:50:37.310 --> 04:50:37.320 align:start position:0%
knowingly he added a men's Raya to a
 
04:50:39.650 --> 04:50:39.660 align:start position:0%
statute that doesn't exist it's not in
 
04:50:41.750 --> 04:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
there I don't see knowingly in there so
 
04:50:43.868 --> 04:50:43.878 align:start position:0%
it's just the way that's written is
 
04:50:46.850 --> 04:50:46.860 align:start position:0%
anyone I guess the judge will be like ah
 
04:50:48.050 --> 04:50:48.060 align:start position:0%
you should have known that thousand
 
04:50:49.190 --> 04:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
dollar fine
 
04:50:51.530 --> 04:50:51.540 align:start position:0%
there's no is there an appeal process
 
04:50:53.510 --> 04:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
what it just doesn't make sense for
 
04:50:55.610 --> 04:50:55.620 align:start position:0%
these reasons the nhpa is opposed to
 
04:51:00.288 --> 04:51:00.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:02.990 --> 04:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:51:05.030 --> 04:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
we're all good all right thank you very
 
04:51:07.850 --> 04:51:07.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:13.250 --> 04:51:13.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:14.690 --> 04:51:14.700 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
04:51:16.610 --> 04:51:16.620 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Christopher ice 159
 
04:51:19.430 --> 04:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
10 Rod Road in Rochester I'm here to
 
04:51:21.050 --> 04:51:21.060 align:start position:0%
speak in
 
04:51:23.150 --> 04:51:23.160 align:start position:0%
approval of this bill I believe that
 
04:51:26.510 --> 04:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
this bill is a good bill uh to lay the
 
04:51:29.770 --> 04:51:29.780 align:start position:0%
framework to fair and honest policing
 
04:51:32.570 --> 04:51:32.580 align:start position:0%
and keep our judges Injustice of the
 
04:51:35.208 --> 04:51:35.218 align:start position:0%
pieces accountable myself is a justice
 
04:51:37.610 --> 04:51:37.620 align:start position:0%
of the peace and in my previous
 
04:51:39.230 --> 04:51:39.240 align:start position:0%
profession before I became a small
 
04:51:40.810 --> 04:51:40.820 align:start position:0%
business owner
 
04:51:44.090 --> 04:51:44.100 align:start position:0%
was served several times with arrest
 
04:51:46.368 --> 04:51:46.378 align:start position:0%
warrants misdemeanor arrest warrants but
 
04:51:48.230 --> 04:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
arrest warrants nonetheless
 
04:51:51.770 --> 04:51:51.780 align:start position:0%
and in my profession I had denied
 
04:51:53.390 --> 04:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
throughout the course of my career
 
04:51:55.970 --> 04:51:55.980 align:start position:0%
probably seven to ten of those because
 
04:51:58.250 --> 04:51:58.260 align:start position:0%
they didn't have enough evidence that I
 
04:52:00.590 --> 04:52:00.600 align:start position:0%
felt was reasonable enough
 
04:52:03.788 --> 04:52:03.798 align:start position:0%
or I felt that they committed the crime
 
04:52:07.490 --> 04:52:07.500 align:start position:0%
and officers have said to me in that
 
04:52:09.650 --> 04:52:09.660 align:start position:0%
moment well I'll just drive down the
 
04:52:12.530 --> 04:52:12.540 align:start position:0%
street to the next Police Department to
 
04:52:14.750 --> 04:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
have a bail commissioner or justice of
 
04:52:17.930 --> 04:52:17.940 align:start position:0%
the peace sign that warrant I think that
 
04:52:19.730 --> 04:52:19.740 align:start position:0%
the previous testimony that you received
 
04:52:22.490 --> 04:52:22.500 align:start position:0%
about exculpatory evidence they were
 
04:52:24.350 --> 04:52:24.360 align:start position:0%
mixing the two
 
04:52:27.230 --> 04:52:27.240 align:start position:0%
um about what is exculpatory evidence
 
04:52:30.170 --> 04:52:30.180 align:start position:0%
versus this becoming exculpatory
 
04:52:30.180 --> 04:52:31.368 align:start position:0%
versus this becoming exculpatory
evidence

04:52:31.368 --> 04:52:31.378 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
04:52:34.390 --> 04:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
how the bill is laid out it states
 
04:52:37.788 --> 04:52:37.798 align:start position:0%
that the denial will become the evidence
 
04:52:40.730 --> 04:52:40.740 align:start position:0%
to the next judge
 
04:52:43.250 --> 04:52:43.260 align:start position:0%
okay so that is the evidence that would
 
04:52:45.230 --> 04:52:45.240 align:start position:0%
be exculpatory
 
04:52:48.770 --> 04:52:48.780 align:start position:0%
going forward past that point of going
 
04:52:50.330 --> 04:52:50.340 align:start position:0%
to the first judge or Justice of the
 
04:52:52.850 --> 04:52:52.860 align:start position:0%
Peace in addition there was a question
 
04:52:55.490 --> 04:52:55.500 align:start position:0%
earlier about how Justice of the pieces
 
04:52:57.410 --> 04:52:57.420 align:start position:0%
track this information well I have my
 
04:53:01.250 --> 04:53:01.260 align:start position:0%
own tracker so that way if I ever get
 
04:53:03.288 --> 04:53:03.298 align:start position:0%
questioned why did I sign this warrant
 
04:53:06.110 --> 04:53:06.120 align:start position:0%
or who did I sign that paperwork for I
 
04:53:08.510 --> 04:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
have all that information personally but
 
04:53:10.550 --> 04:53:10.560 align:start position:0%
there's no State system there's no
 
04:53:12.170 --> 04:53:12.180 align:start position:0%
system through the courts there's no
 
04:53:14.448 --> 04:53:14.458 align:start position:0%
system through law enforcement agencies
 
04:53:16.250 --> 04:53:16.260 align:start position:0%
there's no system through the Secretary
 
04:53:18.470 --> 04:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
of State's office which I received my
 
04:53:22.190 --> 04:53:22.200 align:start position:0%
commission from to track
 
04:53:24.890 --> 04:53:24.900 align:start position:0%
what paperwork I signed for who I sign
 
04:53:26.330 --> 04:53:26.340 align:start position:0%
it for
 
04:53:29.330 --> 04:53:29.340 align:start position:0%
so that might be something that comes
 
04:53:31.970 --> 04:53:31.980 align:start position:0%
later in the process we have a state
 
04:53:34.610 --> 04:53:34.620 align:start position:0%
system for campaign Finance we have a
 
04:53:35.868 --> 04:53:35.878 align:start position:0%
state system that you can search
 
04:53:39.590 --> 04:53:39.600 align:start position:0%
business names and LLC names why don't
 
04:53:42.170 --> 04:53:42.180 align:start position:0%
we have a system online that has a
 
04:53:44.330 --> 04:53:44.340 align:start position:0%
justice of the peace or a judge can log
 
04:53:48.230 --> 04:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
into and see last name rice oh I see
 
04:53:48.240 --> 04:53:49.430 align:start position:0%
into and see last name rice oh I see
that

04:53:49.430 --> 04:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:53:52.788 --> 04:53:52.798 align:start position:0%
Mrs Smith I'm using a generalized name
 
04:53:52.798 --> 04:53:53.590 align:start position:0%
Mrs Smith I'm using a generalized name
here

04:53:53.590 --> 04:53:53.600 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:53:57.890 --> 04:53:57.900 align:start position:0%
denied that application for a warrant
 
04:53:59.690 --> 04:53:59.700 align:start position:0%
we're talking about fair and honest
 
04:54:02.570 --> 04:54:02.580 align:start position:0%
transparency in the police world and in
 
04:54:04.788 --> 04:54:04.798 align:start position:0%
the judicial system
 
04:54:07.430 --> 04:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
I feel that this bill would start that
 
04:54:09.530 --> 04:54:09.540 align:start position:0%
framework and start that process going
 
04:54:11.690 --> 04:54:11.700 align:start position:0%
forward to
 
04:54:13.670 --> 04:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
making sure that we hold everyone
 
04:54:13.680 --> 04:54:15.948 align:start position:0%
making sure that we hold everyone
accountable

04:54:15.948 --> 04:54:15.958 align:start position:0%
accountable
 
04:54:15.958 --> 04:54:17.390 align:start position:0%
accountable
um

04:54:17.390 --> 04:54:17.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:54:19.128 --> 04:54:19.138 align:start position:0%
I I'd be happy to take any questions
 
04:54:23.110 --> 04:54:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:25.670 --> 04:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
representative Newman
 
04:54:27.350 --> 04:54:27.360 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
04:54:28.788 --> 04:54:28.798 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:54:30.410 --> 04:54:30.420 align:start position:0%
and I just want to make sure I
 
04:54:32.448 --> 04:54:32.458 align:start position:0%
understood the testimony that you just
 
04:54:35.750 --> 04:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
gave and I believe it was that you had
 
04:54:35.760 --> 04:54:36.948 align:start position:0%
gave and I believe it was that you had
denied

04:54:36.948 --> 04:54:36.958 align:start position:0%
denied
 
04:54:40.610 --> 04:54:40.620 align:start position:0%
um requests for an arrest warrant and
 
04:54:43.310 --> 04:54:43.320 align:start position:0%
then you became knowledgeable or or able
 
04:54:46.070 --> 04:54:46.080 align:start position:0%
to determine that that
 
04:54:50.690 --> 04:54:50.700 align:start position:0%
arrest warrant was issued then by a uh a
 
04:54:54.230 --> 04:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
justice of a piece and could not only
 
04:54:56.810 --> 04:54:56.820 align:start position:0%
you be able to use that method that you
 
04:54:59.930 --> 04:54:59.940 align:start position:0%
used could Justice and pieces can
 
04:55:03.708 --> 04:55:03.718 align:start position:0%
justices of the peace can they could
 
04:55:06.708 --> 04:55:06.718 align:start position:0%
they determine that if that happened in
 
04:55:09.530 --> 04:55:09.540 align:start position:0%
just that thank you yeah thank you for
 
04:55:12.050 --> 04:55:12.060 align:start position:0%
the question representative so uh the
 
04:55:14.628 --> 04:55:14.638 align:start position:0%
agency that I worked for specifically we
 
04:55:17.030 --> 04:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
had seven Justice of the pieces work in
 
04:55:18.350 --> 04:55:18.360 align:start position:0%
the same building
 
04:55:20.810 --> 04:55:20.820 align:start position:0%
so if I
 
04:55:23.570 --> 04:55:23.580 align:start position:0%
denied it right then and there they
 
04:55:25.250 --> 04:55:25.260 align:start position:0%
could go to another Justice of the Peace
 
04:55:26.690 --> 04:55:26.700 align:start position:0%
just down the hall
 
04:55:28.490 --> 04:55:28.500 align:start position:0%
or they could go to another agency
 
04:55:30.110 --> 04:55:30.120 align:start position:0%
across town
 
04:55:32.510 --> 04:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
I knew of Justice of the pieces that
 
04:55:34.550 --> 04:55:34.560 align:start position:0%
worked in the same Police Department as
 
04:55:35.930 --> 04:55:35.940 align:start position:0%
the officer that was applying for the
 
04:55:38.448 --> 04:55:38.458 align:start position:0%
arrest warrant and I felt that it was a
 
04:55:41.690 --> 04:55:41.700 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest but that was just
 
04:55:44.570 --> 04:55:44.580 align:start position:0%
hearsay communication that was me
 
04:55:46.610 --> 04:55:46.620 align:start position:0%
speaking to you and you speaking back to
 
04:55:50.270 --> 04:55:50.280 align:start position:0%
me or I hear an off-the-cuff remark or
 
04:55:53.510 --> 04:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
comment that is not a bona fide
 
04:55:58.128 --> 04:55:58.138 align:start position:0%
legitimate system and what I'm and I
 
04:56:00.050 --> 04:56:00.060 align:start position:0%
have no right to propose anything but if
 
04:56:02.090 --> 04:56:02.100 align:start position:0%
I were to propose something this online
 
04:56:05.330 --> 04:56:05.340 align:start position:0%
system I would have to establish what
 
04:56:08.448 --> 04:56:08.458 align:start position:0%
the grounds are on that system
 
04:56:15.170 --> 04:56:15.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:18.590 --> 04:56:18.600 align:start position:0%
and I haven't completely read all of the
 
04:56:22.070 --> 04:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
bill this bill does not propose such a
 
04:56:25.190 --> 04:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
system as you are just that is that that
 
04:56:27.288 --> 04:56:27.298 align:start position:0%
is correct representative the bill does
 
04:56:29.868 --> 04:56:29.878 align:start position:0%
not propose a system that is just my own
 
04:56:31.550 --> 04:56:31.560 align:start position:0%
internal thought
 
04:56:33.350 --> 04:56:33.360 align:start position:0%
um you know reading the bill this would
 
04:56:36.708 --> 04:56:36.718 align:start position:0%
lay a groundwork to such system later
 
04:56:38.570 --> 04:56:38.580 align:start position:0%
down the line
 
04:56:41.930 --> 04:56:41.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:43.368 --> 04:56:43.378 align:start position:0%
thank you madam Sharon thank you for
 
04:56:45.770 --> 04:56:45.780 align:start position:0%
taking my question yes thank you when in
 
04:56:47.208 --> 04:56:47.218 align:start position:0%
that specific instance that you're
 
04:56:48.470 --> 04:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
referring to and I don't know if it's
 
04:56:50.750 --> 04:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
just that one but let's just pick one
 
04:56:52.610 --> 04:56:52.620 align:start position:0%
um were you able was there some type of
 
04:56:55.010 --> 04:56:55.020 align:start position:0%
accountability because you knew that
 
04:56:57.530 --> 04:56:57.540 align:start position:0%
that officer was was going to ask
 
04:56:59.690 --> 04:56:59.700 align:start position:0%
another judge Justice of the piece or
 
04:57:01.128 --> 04:57:01.138 align:start position:0%
something like that were you able to
 
04:57:03.530 --> 04:57:03.540 align:start position:0%
report that and was there some process
 
04:57:05.810 --> 04:57:05.820 align:start position:0%
mechanism by which you know it was
 
04:57:07.730 --> 04:57:07.740 align:start position:0%
addressed in that in that instance that
 
04:57:10.850 --> 04:57:10.860 align:start position:0%
you're talking about so the short answer
 
04:57:12.708 --> 04:57:12.718 align:start position:0%
is no
 
04:57:14.930 --> 04:57:14.940 align:start position:0%
um but I will say as a justice of the
 
04:57:16.190 --> 04:57:16.200 align:start position:0%
peace and the reason why I became a
 
04:57:18.890 --> 04:57:18.900 align:start position:0%
Justice of the Peace was not for my job
 
04:57:21.288 --> 04:57:21.298 align:start position:0%
it was a benefit that I was able to add
 
04:57:24.470 --> 04:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
on to my job to serve in that capacity
 
04:57:24.480 --> 04:57:26.930 align:start position:0%
on to my job to serve in that capacity
however

04:57:26.930 --> 04:57:26.940 align:start position:0%
however
 
04:57:26.940 --> 04:57:27.708 align:start position:0%
however
um

04:57:27.708 --> 04:57:27.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:57:30.530 --> 04:57:30.540 align:start position:0%
you know could I make phone calls
 
04:57:34.610 --> 04:57:34.620 align:start position:0%
absolutely but that's not the place to
 
04:57:38.810 --> 04:57:38.820 align:start position:0%
in my opinion interfere with
 
04:57:40.910 --> 04:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
um the Judgment of an arrest warrant I
 
04:57:43.550 --> 04:57:43.560 align:start position:0%
made the decision to deny it that's my
 
04:57:45.770 --> 04:57:45.780 align:start position:0%
decision and I had my grounds for such
 
04:57:45.780 --> 04:57:47.270 align:start position:0%
decision and I had my grounds for such
reasons

04:57:47.270 --> 04:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
04:57:49.850 --> 04:57:49.860 align:start position:0%
um but a different JP or a different
 
04:57:52.490 --> 04:57:52.500 align:start position:0%
judge could feel differently
 
04:57:54.530 --> 04:57:54.540 align:start position:0%
um or they might have had new evidence
 
04:57:56.868 --> 04:57:56.878 align:start position:0%
that came forward before them applying
 
04:58:00.708 --> 04:58:00.718 align:start position:0%
to a different JP or judge
 
04:58:02.390 --> 04:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
okay thank you you're welcome
 
04:58:04.070 --> 04:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
representative Manion
 
04:58:05.570 --> 04:58:05.580 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
04:58:06.948 --> 04:58:06.958 align:start position:0%
taking my question absolutely thank you
 
04:58:09.170 --> 04:58:09.180 align:start position:0%
this is just more of a clarification
 
04:58:10.910 --> 04:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
um because of the the other question
 
04:58:13.850 --> 04:58:13.860 align:start position:0%
sure you you testified earlier that you
 
04:58:15.230 --> 04:58:15.240 align:start position:0%
heard that the person made an off the
 
04:58:17.570 --> 04:58:17.580 align:start position:0%
coffee Market if you go to somebody else
 
04:58:19.250 --> 04:58:19.260 align:start position:0%
and I'm confused did that actually
 
04:58:21.948 --> 04:58:21.958 align:start position:0%
happen they made the off the cuff remark
 
04:58:24.650 --> 04:58:24.660 align:start position:0%
after I had denied it and it was days
 
04:58:28.448 --> 04:58:28.458 align:start position:0%
later that they went to a different JP
 
04:58:31.610 --> 04:58:31.620 align:start position:0%
to get that arrest warrant signed okay I
 
04:58:32.448 --> 04:58:32.458 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make sure they're
 
04:58:34.670 --> 04:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
actually heard yep that's what I had
 
04:58:37.430 --> 04:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
heard days later after I had denied the
 
04:58:40.730 --> 04:58:40.740 align:start position:0%
first that request thank you
 
04:58:42.288 --> 04:58:42.298 align:start position:0%

04:59:22.190 --> 04:59:22.200 align:start position:0%
the the state
 
04:59:24.770 --> 04:59:24.780 align:start position:0%
the state policemen had and I respect
 
04:59:26.270 --> 04:59:26.280 align:start position:0%
them but my opinion is is quite
 
04:59:26.280 --> 04:59:27.350 align:start position:0%
them but my opinion is is quite
different

04:59:27.350 --> 04:59:27.360 align:start position:0%
different
 
04:59:29.030 --> 04:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
um from what this state police officer
 
04:59:31.070 --> 04:59:31.080 align:start position:0%
had mentioned earlier
 
04:59:32.930 --> 04:59:32.940 align:start position:0%
exculpatory evidence
 
04:59:35.208 --> 04:59:35.218 align:start position:0%
is simply evidence that benefits the
 
04:59:35.218 --> 04:59:36.590 align:start position:0%
is simply evidence that benefits the
defendant

04:59:36.590 --> 04:59:36.600 align:start position:0%
defendant
 
04:59:38.208 --> 04:59:38.218 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter whether you're a judge
 
04:59:40.368 --> 04:59:40.378 align:start position:0%
a juror an attorney it all means the
 
04:59:42.470 --> 04:59:42.480 align:start position:0%
same thing
 
04:59:44.448 --> 04:59:44.458 align:start position:0%
he said that it's a problem that doesn't
 
04:59:46.850 --> 04:59:46.860 align:start position:0%
exist well it certainly is a problem and
 
04:59:48.530 --> 04:59:48.540 align:start position:0%
I can tell you from practicing for 15
 
04:59:51.708 --> 04:59:51.718 align:start position:0%
years it's one and I can also tell you a
 
04:59:53.208 --> 04:59:53.218 align:start position:0%
story that it was a problem for me
 
04:59:53.218 --> 04:59:56.390 align:start position:0%
story that it was a problem for me
personally

04:59:56.390 --> 04:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:59.208 --> 04:59:59.218 align:start position:0%
the only thing that this bill is
 
05:00:02.510 --> 05:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
proposing is just to be transparent the
 
05:00:04.730 --> 05:00:04.740 align:start position:0%
only thing we were that we're seeking is
 
05:00:04.740 --> 05:00:05.930 align:start position:0%
only thing we were that we're seeking is
that

05:00:05.930 --> 05:00:05.940 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:00:08.930 --> 05:00:08.940 align:start position:0%
if it's if an arrest warrant is denied
 
05:00:12.110 --> 05:00:12.120 align:start position:0%
you give notice to the next JP if you
 
05:00:14.270 --> 05:00:14.280 align:start position:0%
present it that's all
 
05:00:16.610 --> 05:00:16.620 align:start position:0%
if an arrest warrant is denied and the
 
05:00:19.070 --> 05:00:19.080 align:start position:0%
person is is indicted that you give the
 
05:00:21.350 --> 05:00:21.360 align:start position:0%
grand jury the information if they're
 
05:00:24.230 --> 05:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
aware of it that this was denied by a
 
05:00:26.030 --> 05:00:26.040 align:start position:0%
court or
 
05:00:29.570 --> 05:00:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:32.570 --> 05:00:32.580 align:start position:0%
it's fair and it's honest that's all
 
05:00:34.310 --> 05:00:34.320 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do or that's what this
 
05:00:36.470 --> 05:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
bill does is it creates accountability
 
05:00:38.390 --> 05:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
and honesty
 
05:00:41.030 --> 05:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
and there was testimony also by the
 
05:00:42.530 --> 05:00:42.540 align:start position:0%
state police officer and he said well
 
05:00:44.448 --> 05:00:44.458 align:start position:0%
what if one person didn't know do I got
 
05:00:45.770 --> 05:00:45.780 align:start position:0%
to call the other one at two in the
 
05:00:48.110 --> 05:00:48.120 align:start position:0%
morning the way this the language is
 
05:00:48.120 --> 05:00:49.190 align:start position:0%
morning the way this the language is
created

05:00:49.190 --> 05:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
created
 
05:00:51.890 --> 05:00:51.900 align:start position:0%
it's for the benefit as well for law
 
05:00:53.930 --> 05:00:53.940 align:start position:0%
enforcement because it creates a
 
05:00:56.270 --> 05:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
standard and that standard is here
 
05:00:58.490 --> 05:00:58.500 align:start position:0%
mentioned many times and that's simply
 
05:01:00.470 --> 05:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
that that officer has to have knowledge
 
05:01:03.230 --> 05:01:03.240 align:start position:0%
they have to have knowledge of something
 
05:01:05.330 --> 05:01:05.340 align:start position:0%
if they don't know they don't have to
 
05:01:06.770 --> 05:01:06.780 align:start position:0%
pick the phone up and call someone else
 
05:01:09.050 --> 05:01:09.060 align:start position:0%
at two in the morning it's if they have
 
05:01:11.030 --> 05:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
knowledge that this has been denied
 
05:01:13.430 --> 05:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
before simply that they give it to the
 
05:01:15.708 --> 05:01:15.718 align:start position:0%
next person they propose it to
 
05:01:18.350 --> 05:01:18.360 align:start position:0%
and if they have knowledge
 
05:01:21.110 --> 05:01:21.120 align:start position:0%
it'll create its shell disclose whether
 
05:01:24.050 --> 05:01:24.060 align:start position:0%
they know that's one example shell
 
05:01:26.208 --> 05:01:26.218 align:start position:0%
disclose if they have knowledge
 
05:01:27.948 --> 05:01:27.958 align:start position:0%
they don't have knowledge then they
 
05:01:29.930 --> 05:01:29.940 align:start position:0%
don't have any burden to disclose it the
 
05:01:33.890 --> 05:01:33.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:35.868 --> 05:01:35.878 align:start position:0%
it says well does that relate to the
 
05:01:37.850 --> 05:01:37.860 align:start position:0%
entire agency that was another question
 
05:01:37.860 --> 05:01:39.350 align:start position:0%
entire agency that was another question
posed

05:01:39.350 --> 05:01:39.360 align:start position:0%
posed
 
05:01:41.930 --> 05:01:41.940 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say anything about agency it
 
05:01:44.810 --> 05:01:44.820 align:start position:0%
just says if they have knowledge this is
 
05:01:47.090 --> 05:01:47.100 align:start position:0%
the person that's filing the arrest
 
05:01:47.100 --> 05:01:51.288 align:start position:0%
the person that's filing the arrest
warrant

05:01:51.288 --> 05:01:51.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:54.288 --> 05:01:54.298 align:start position:0%
in in my instance I was involved in a
 
05:01:54.298 --> 05:01:55.910 align:start position:0%
in in my instance I was involved in a
divorce

05:01:55.910 --> 05:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
divorce
 
05:01:58.310 --> 05:01:58.320 align:start position:0%
in in my case
 
05:01:58.320 --> 05:01:59.150 align:start position:0%
in in my case
um

05:01:59.150 --> 05:01:59.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:02.330 --> 05:02:02.340 align:start position:0%
my now ex-wife who I'm friends with
 
05:02:04.788 --> 05:02:04.798 align:start position:0%
again had tried to preclude me from any
 
05:02:06.650 --> 05:02:06.660 align:start position:0%
contact with my son
 
05:02:10.430 --> 05:02:10.440 align:start position:0%
he was 11 years old at the time
 
05:02:12.708 --> 05:02:12.718 align:start position:0%
so every time there was an allegation
 
05:02:16.010 --> 05:02:16.020 align:start position:0%
against me personally and it failed in
 
05:02:17.448 --> 05:02:17.458 align:start position:0%
court she would step it up and there
 
05:02:20.090 --> 05:02:20.100 align:start position:0%
would be something worse and worse well
 
05:02:22.550 --> 05:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
the second to the last worst one is that
 
05:02:24.410 --> 05:02:24.420 align:start position:0%
I allegedly beat my own son which was
 
05:02:24.420 --> 05:02:25.850 align:start position:0%
I allegedly beat my own son which was
ridiculous

05:02:25.850 --> 05:02:25.860 align:start position:0%
ridiculous
 
05:02:29.208 --> 05:02:29.218 align:start position:0%
when that failed in court she said she
 
05:02:31.310 --> 05:02:31.320 align:start position:0%
went to the police in Portsmouth and she
 
05:02:34.250 --> 05:02:34.260 align:start position:0%
said my husband started molesting my son
 
05:02:36.288 --> 05:02:36.298 align:start position:0%
a month ago when he filed for a divorce
 
05:02:39.708 --> 05:02:39.718 align:start position:0%
which was absolutely ridiculous and you
 
05:02:42.890 --> 05:02:42.900 align:start position:0%
could see each thing Step Up
 
05:02:45.350 --> 05:02:45.360 align:start position:0%
so Portsmouth Police went to file an
 
05:02:47.690 --> 05:02:47.700 align:start position:0%
arrest warrant for me an innocent parent
 
05:02:50.390 --> 05:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
a father of a son who is also an
 
05:02:53.690 --> 05:02:53.700 align:start position:0%
attorney and well-known and respected in
 
05:02:55.128 --> 05:02:55.138 align:start position:0%
a city
 
05:02:57.650 --> 05:02:57.660 align:start position:0%
that arrest warrant a judge makes a
 
05:02:59.330 --> 05:02:59.340 align:start position:0%
determination whether there's probable
 
05:03:01.850 --> 05:03:01.860 align:start position:0%
cause to issue the arrest warrant a
 
05:03:03.288 --> 05:03:03.298 align:start position:0%
court determined there was no probable
 
05:03:05.330 --> 05:03:05.340 align:start position:0%
cause in my situation and denied the
 
05:03:08.750 --> 05:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:11.530 --> 05:03:11.540 align:start position:0%
those that that Police Department
 
05:03:14.330 --> 05:03:14.340 align:start position:0%
circumvented the Circ the district court
 
05:03:17.810 --> 05:03:17.820 align:start position:0%
order finding no probable cause and
 
05:03:20.090 --> 05:03:20.100 align:start position:0%
indicted me through a grand jury for the
 
05:03:23.270 --> 05:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
same thing an innocent parent
 
05:03:25.910 --> 05:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
someone that was innocent of these
 
05:03:28.250 --> 05:03:28.260 align:start position:0%
allegations which were clearly
 
05:03:28.260 --> 05:03:29.690 align:start position:0%
allegations which were clearly
false

05:03:29.690 --> 05:03:29.700 align:start position:0%
false
 
05:03:31.788 --> 05:03:31.798 align:start position:0%
at this point you know I'm over it now
 
05:03:35.270 --> 05:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
but I can tell you I wasn't happy then
 
05:03:39.288 --> 05:03:39.298 align:start position:0%
what this would have done is simply
 
05:03:41.448 --> 05:03:41.458 align:start position:0%
to tell the grand jury this is on
 
05:03:43.010 --> 05:03:43.020 align:start position:0%
section three
 
05:03:46.490 --> 05:03:46.500 align:start position:0%
that this issue came before a court and
 
05:03:48.470 --> 05:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
it was denied where Court found probable
 
05:03:50.628 --> 05:03:50.638 align:start position:0%
cause was lacking that's all this does
 
05:03:54.530 --> 05:03:54.540 align:start position:0%
is just require law enforcement to tell
 
05:03:56.208 --> 05:03:56.218 align:start position:0%
the next person when they're Forum
 
05:03:57.170 --> 05:03:57.180 align:start position:0%
Shopping and doing something
 
05:03:59.448 --> 05:03:59.458 align:start position:0%
inappropriate like this and as the
 
05:04:01.730 --> 05:04:01.740 align:start position:0%
testimonial you heard before me just to
 
05:04:07.850 --> 05:04:07.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:11.208 --> 05:04:11.218 align:start position:0%
so during my case dcyf did a formal
 
05:04:13.010 --> 05:04:13.020 align:start position:0%
investigation they also found the
 
05:04:16.010 --> 05:04:16.020 align:start position:0%
allegations were unfounded
 
05:04:18.530 --> 05:04:18.540 align:start position:0%
for one year and 11 months I didn't get
 
05:04:20.510 --> 05:04:20.520 align:start position:0%
to see my son now if any of you have
 
05:04:22.970 --> 05:04:22.980 align:start position:0%
kids and your children are 11 I can tell
 
05:04:24.350 --> 05:04:24.360 align:start position:0%
you when you get them back when they're
 
05:04:26.390 --> 05:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
14 they look quite a bit different
 
05:04:28.430 --> 05:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
they might have grown four inches their
 
05:04:29.868 --> 05:04:29.878 align:start position:0%
voice sounds different and they look
 
05:04:31.250 --> 05:04:31.260 align:start position:0%
totally different I didn't even get to
 
05:04:33.350 --> 05:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
see a text message for my son during
 
05:04:34.490 --> 05:04:34.500 align:start position:0%
that time
 
05:04:37.930 --> 05:04:37.940 align:start position:0%
and why because something simple as this
 
05:04:41.030 --> 05:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
occurred to me and it's all it created
 
05:04:43.550 --> 05:04:43.560 align:start position:0%
was transparency to the person that's
 
05:04:45.890 --> 05:04:45.900 align:start position:0%
trying it
 
05:04:48.470 --> 05:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
it puts the burden of law enforcement to
 
05:04:52.010 --> 05:04:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:55.250 --> 05:04:55.260 align:start position:0%
if they're not what happens to them
 
05:04:57.530 --> 05:04:57.540 align:start position:0%
not really that much
 
05:04:59.390 --> 05:04:59.400 align:start position:0%
they can get up to a thousand dollar
 
05:04:59.400 --> 05:05:01.070 align:start position:0%
they can get up to a thousand dollar
fine

05:05:01.070 --> 05:05:01.080 align:start position:0%
fine
 
05:05:03.650 --> 05:05:03.660 align:start position:0%
they could get a dollar fine the judge
 
05:05:05.750 --> 05:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
has discretion to hear the case and he
 
05:05:07.490 --> 05:05:07.500 align:start position:0%
can determine whether or not the person
 
05:05:10.310 --> 05:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
violated it and to what extent
 
05:05:12.530 --> 05:05:12.540 align:start position:0%
so when they say it's going to take
 
05:05:14.570 --> 05:05:14.580 align:start position:0%
money out of the pocket of innocent law
 
05:05:14.580 --> 05:05:15.890 align:start position:0%
money out of the pocket of innocent law
enforcement

05:05:15.890 --> 05:05:15.900 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
05:05:18.050 --> 05:05:18.060 align:start position:0%
people a judge will look at this
 
05:05:21.350 --> 05:05:21.360 align:start position:0%
objectively and decide was this person
 
05:05:24.350 --> 05:05:24.360 align:start position:0%
deserving of a fine one he could say
 
05:05:26.448 --> 05:05:26.458 align:start position:0%
there's no fine he could say there's a
 
05:05:28.730 --> 05:05:28.740 align:start position:0%
dollar and certainly he could say
 
05:05:30.770 --> 05:05:30.780 align:start position:0%
there's a thousand
 
05:05:33.530 --> 05:05:33.540 align:start position:0%
this would ensure
 
05:05:36.230 --> 05:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
basic Integrity in our system that is
 
05:05:38.030 --> 05:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
clearly lacking from my testimony and
 
05:05:40.190 --> 05:05:40.200 align:start position:0%
you heard someone else before me a
 
05:05:41.868 --> 05:05:41.878 align:start position:0%
Justice of the Peace here in our state
 
05:05:44.810 --> 05:05:44.820 align:start position:0%
where if one arrest warrant fails it's
 
05:05:47.750 --> 05:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
proposed to another one and I wonder in
 
05:05:49.610 --> 05:05:49.620 align:start position:0%
as in my case and what he has testified
 
05:05:52.550 --> 05:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
how often this happens we'll never know
 
05:05:54.708 --> 05:05:54.718 align:start position:0%
because there's no track record we have
 
05:05:56.628 --> 05:05:56.638 align:start position:0%
nothing in our system that accounts for
 
05:05:59.270 --> 05:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
all of these multiple petitions for
 
05:05:59.280 --> 05:06:00.288 align:start position:0%
all of these multiple petitions for
somebody

05:06:00.288 --> 05:06:00.298 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
05:06:04.190 --> 05:06:04.200 align:start position:0%
in my case ultimately my mine was Noel
 
05:06:06.650 --> 05:06:06.660 align:start position:0%
Prost withdrawn
 
05:06:08.690 --> 05:06:08.700 align:start position:0%
and the finding was insufficient
 
05:06:08.700 --> 05:06:09.770 align:start position:0%
and the finding was insufficient
evidence

05:06:09.770 --> 05:06:09.780 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
05:06:11.990 --> 05:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
well a year and 11 months I didn't get
 
05:06:13.910 --> 05:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
to see my son
 
05:06:16.910 --> 05:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
because I got indicted and was that
 
05:06:20.448 --> 05:06:20.458 align:start position:0%
disclosed to the grand jury
 
05:06:22.730 --> 05:06:22.740 align:start position:0%
it should have been exculpatory
 
05:06:24.830 --> 05:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
information should have been disclosed
 
05:06:27.350 --> 05:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
that in my instance this is a father
 
05:06:29.448 --> 05:06:29.458 align:start position:0%
that's fighting for the for the custody
 
05:06:31.788 --> 05:06:31.798 align:start position:0%
of his child and anything that was
 
05:06:33.530 --> 05:06:33.540 align:start position:0%
exculpatory should have been discussed
 
05:06:35.990 --> 05:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
with a grand jury
 
05:06:39.350 --> 05:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
and here we are for me I can tell you
 
05:06:41.030 --> 05:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
the degree of frustration that I felt
 
05:06:42.590 --> 05:06:42.600 align:start position:0%
that this is just dropped for
 
05:06:44.448 --> 05:06:44.458 align:start position:0%
insufficient evidence after a court of
 
05:06:46.070 --> 05:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
law already made the decision in the
 
05:06:50.990 --> 05:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:54.110 --> 05:06:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:56.208 --> 05:06:56.218 align:start position:0%
representative Newman
 
05:06:58.190 --> 05:06:58.200 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
05:07:02.390 --> 05:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
um if you look at line two uh line 11 in
 
05:07:04.070 --> 05:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
section two and you talked about I
 
05:07:05.750 --> 05:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
believe you said
 
05:07:07.550 --> 05:07:07.560 align:start position:0%
um all I have to do is if they if they
 
05:07:09.410 --> 05:07:09.420 align:start position:0%
have knowledge it says whether they have
 
05:07:11.208 --> 05:07:11.218 align:start position:0%
knowledge I want is there a problem with
 
05:07:14.750 --> 05:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
that and it also says they and there was
 
05:07:17.208 --> 05:07:17.218 align:start position:0%
previous testimony I believe that said
 
05:07:19.010 --> 05:07:19.020 align:start position:0%
it would be impossible and I believe
 
05:07:20.628 --> 05:07:20.638 align:start position:0%
that they refers to the enforcement
 
05:07:22.368 --> 05:07:22.378 align:start position:0%
agency and I believe there was testimony
 
05:07:25.788 --> 05:07:25.798 align:start position:0%
that said that how could the agency know
 
05:07:28.730 --> 05:07:28.740 align:start position:0%
so is there a problem with that and so
 
05:07:30.650 --> 05:07:30.660 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious as to your your
 
05:07:38.390 --> 05:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:40.070 --> 05:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
I think the way it's worded is it's
 
05:07:40.080 --> 05:07:41.810 align:start position:0%
I think the way it's worded is it's
discretionary

05:07:41.810 --> 05:07:41.820 align:start position:0%
discretionary
 
05:07:44.090 --> 05:07:44.100 align:start position:0%
the first word is the law enforcement
 
05:07:44.100 --> 05:07:45.410 align:start position:0%
the first word is the law enforcement
officer

05:07:45.410 --> 05:07:45.420 align:start position:0%
officer
 
05:07:47.330 --> 05:07:47.340 align:start position:0%
and it does say or law enforcement
 
05:07:49.610 --> 05:07:49.620 align:start position:0%
agency requesting a search warrant shall
 
05:07:54.350 --> 05:07:54.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:57.590 --> 05:07:57.600 align:start position:0%
we'll look at what happened to me
 
05:08:00.530 --> 05:08:00.540 align:start position:0%
if some if they have knowledge whether
 
05:08:03.530 --> 05:08:03.540 align:start position:0%
it's one person filing it or there's two
 
05:08:07.910 --> 05:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:10.850 --> 05:08:10.860 align:start position:0%
before they file they should make sure
 
05:08:12.530 --> 05:08:12.540 align:start position:0%
that they're being honest and they
 
05:08:14.270 --> 05:08:14.280 align:start position:0%
disclose whether it's multiple people
 
05:08:16.610 --> 05:08:16.620 align:start position:0%
that are working on the case because the
 
05:08:18.470 --> 05:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
person that's filing an arrest warrant
 
05:08:20.390 --> 05:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
they're submitting the facts on what the
 
05:08:22.788 --> 05:08:22.798 align:start position:0%
person did they should be competent
 
05:08:26.150 --> 05:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
enough to review the file thoroughly to
 
05:08:27.948 --> 05:08:27.958 align:start position:0%
make sure that the facts go forward
 
05:08:27.958 --> 05:08:29.510 align:start position:0%
make sure that the facts go forward
including

05:08:29.510 --> 05:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
including
 
05:08:31.850 --> 05:08:31.860 align:start position:0%
those that are exculpatory
 
05:08:33.470 --> 05:08:33.480 align:start position:0%
that are known
 
05:08:36.708 --> 05:08:36.718 align:start position:0%
they review the file that's how the
 
05:08:38.868 --> 05:08:38.878 align:start position:0%
these arrest warrants are done and if
 
05:08:42.288 --> 05:08:42.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:47.590 --> 05:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:49.670 --> 05:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
05:08:51.230 --> 05:08:51.240 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:08:52.910 --> 05:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
um I actually have a 14 and 15 year old
 
05:08:54.948 --> 05:08:54.958 align:start position:0%
boy and I I can't imagine spending a
 
05:08:56.990 --> 05:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
year and 11 months without them my
 
05:08:59.150 --> 05:08:59.160 align:start position:0%
question is when you were explaining
 
05:09:00.770 --> 05:09:00.780 align:start position:0%
just talking about the story you were
 
05:09:02.868 --> 05:09:02.878 align:start position:0%
saying that it escalated each time which
 
05:09:04.490 --> 05:09:04.500 align:start position:0%
to me I would interpret as there was
 
05:09:06.530 --> 05:09:06.540 align:start position:0%
more evidence the next time around or
 
05:09:07.910 --> 05:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
there was something that changed the
 
05:09:09.948 --> 05:09:09.958 align:start position:0%
next time it came around but this seems
 
05:09:11.750 --> 05:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
to be talking about if the evidence is
 
05:09:14.690 --> 05:09:14.700 align:start position:0%
the same could you kind of clarify that
 
05:09:14.700 --> 05:09:16.010 align:start position:0%
the same could you kind of clarify that
hmm

05:09:16.010 --> 05:09:16.020 align:start position:0%
hmm
 
05:09:16.020 --> 05:09:17.690 align:start position:0%
hmm
well

05:09:17.690 --> 05:09:17.700 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:09:21.050 --> 05:09:21.060 align:start position:0%
if so so in my instance it was the same
 
05:09:23.750 --> 05:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
evidence it was I was in Family Court
 
05:09:25.730 --> 05:09:25.740 align:start position:0%
so you know it's common because I
 
05:09:27.650 --> 05:09:27.660 align:start position:0%
practice family law as well so if one
 
05:09:30.170 --> 05:09:30.180 align:start position:0%
thing fails quite often a a parent
 
05:09:32.208 --> 05:09:32.218 align:start position:0%
that's trying to preclude
 
05:09:33.948 --> 05:09:33.958 align:start position:0%
um custody with another parent they'll
 
05:09:36.708 --> 05:09:36.718 align:start position:0%
step up so like first the in my instance
 
05:09:38.448 --> 05:09:38.458 align:start position:0%
and I'll tie to my case rather than my
 
05:09:41.030 --> 05:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
clients dcyf showed up because they said
 
05:09:43.490 --> 05:09:43.500 align:start position:0%
I wasn't my wife then was saying I
 
05:09:45.590 --> 05:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
wasn't feeding my son which he was
 
05:09:47.810 --> 05:09:47.820 align:start position:0%
overweight so if that doesn't work then
 
05:09:49.070 --> 05:09:49.080 align:start position:0%
it gets stepped up
 
05:09:51.708 --> 05:09:51.718 align:start position:0%
and it gets stepped up again and again
 
05:09:54.708 --> 05:09:54.718 align:start position:0%
but in this instance how it ties
 
05:09:57.650 --> 05:09:57.660 align:start position:0%
to the
 
05:10:01.430 --> 05:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
the evidence was always the same
 
05:10:04.190 --> 05:10:04.200 align:start position:0%
so that's a it's a family court issue
 
05:10:06.890 --> 05:10:06.900 align:start position:0%
that is separate from the criminal issue
 
05:10:10.128 --> 05:10:10.138 align:start position:0%
the criminal issue they they will
 
05:10:11.930 --> 05:10:11.940 align:start position:0%
have what they do is they talk to
 
05:10:11.940 --> 05:10:13.970 align:start position:0%
have what they do is they talk to
Witnesses

05:10:13.970 --> 05:10:13.980 align:start position:0%
Witnesses
 
05:10:13.980 --> 05:10:14.930 align:start position:0%
Witnesses
um

05:10:14.930 --> 05:10:14.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:10:17.510 --> 05:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
and that's what creates the body of the
 
05:10:20.090 --> 05:10:20.100 align:start position:0%
majority of what ends up in the arrest
 
05:10:22.730 --> 05:10:22.740 align:start position:0%
um the the facts
 
05:10:24.170 --> 05:10:24.180 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:10:25.850 --> 05:10:25.860 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony is there
 
05:10:27.350 --> 05:10:27.360 align:start position:0%

05:10:30.240 --> 05:10:31.150 align:start position:0%
bill that has not turned in a pink card

05:10:54.050 --> 05:10:54.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:55.788 --> 05:10:55.798 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you members

that uh you know I'm uh I'm a
 
05:11:10.730 --> 05:11:10.740 align:start position:0%
a strong supporter of law enforcement my
 
05:11:13.670 --> 05:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
grandfather was a a cop in Lawrence
 
05:11:16.670 --> 05:11:16.680 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and uh and I understand a
 
05:11:18.590 --> 05:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
good chunk of what these guys have to go
 
05:11:21.410 --> 05:11:21.420 align:start position:0%
through they when they get get called uh
 
05:11:22.910 --> 05:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
somebody there doesn't want them there
 
05:11:25.010 --> 05:11:25.020 align:start position:0%
and uh you know it can make for an awful
 
05:11:26.448 --> 05:11:26.458 align:start position:0%
difficult day
 
05:11:27.708 --> 05:11:27.718 align:start position:0%
um anyway
 
05:11:31.430 --> 05:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
um this uh I put this bill in because
 
05:11:31.440 --> 05:11:32.270 align:start position:0%
um this uh I put this bill in because
um

05:11:32.270 --> 05:11:32.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:34.850 --> 05:11:34.860 align:start position:0%
there's uh I I well I went to a seminar
 
05:11:38.090 --> 05:11:38.100 align:start position:0%
and it was put on by Americans for
 
05:11:40.850 --> 05:11:40.860 align:start position:0%
Prosperity and uh they were they were
 
05:11:43.128 --> 05:11:43.138 align:start position:0%
talking about uh trying it's going after
 
05:11:45.530 --> 05:11:45.540 align:start position:0%
qualified immunity and uh that one of
 
05:11:47.150 --> 05:11:47.160 align:start position:0%
the big things was uh you know police
 
05:11:49.490 --> 05:11:49.500 align:start position:0%
brutality and you know cops that are on
 
05:11:52.190 --> 05:11:52.200 align:start position:0%
steroids uh uh you know guilty of it
 
05:11:53.690 --> 05:11:53.700 align:start position:0%
more than more than others they
 
05:11:56.930 --> 05:11:56.940 align:start position:0%
administer a a much nastier beating and
 
05:11:58.910 --> 05:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
what have you but uh
 
05:12:01.368 --> 05:12:01.378 align:start position:0%
you know I I don't want to see
 
05:12:03.410 --> 05:12:03.420 align:start position:0%
police officers lose qualified immunity
 
05:12:06.050 --> 05:12:06.060 align:start position:0%
uh well it would would uh would
 
05:12:07.850 --> 05:12:07.860 align:start position:0%
certainly have chaos in the streets and
 
05:12:09.650 --> 05:12:09.660 align:start position:0%
uh you know they wouldn't be able to
 
05:12:12.770 --> 05:12:12.780 align:start position:0%
hold on to a cop so anyway uh you know I
 
05:12:15.830 --> 05:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
I Look to remedy the problem I I don't
 
05:12:18.350 --> 05:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
you know with with roughly 4 500 law
 
05:12:19.850 --> 05:12:19.860 align:start position:0%
enforcement people in the state of New
 
05:12:21.050 --> 05:12:21.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I don't think everybody's
 
05:12:24.410 --> 05:12:24.420 align:start position:0%
squeaky clean you know and uh you know
 
05:12:26.150 --> 05:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
if uh
 
05:12:27.948 --> 05:12:27.958 align:start position:0%
if a cop's clean
 
05:12:29.990 --> 05:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
they should have no problem with this
 
05:12:32.690 --> 05:12:32.700 align:start position:0%
you know if they don't do steroids uh
 
05:12:34.368 --> 05:12:34.378 align:start position:0%
that they'll have absolutely no problem
 
05:12:36.350 --> 05:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
and steroids are the anabolic steroids
 
05:12:37.850 --> 05:12:37.860 align:start position:0%
are an illegal substance just like
 
05:12:37.860 --> 05:12:39.288 align:start position:0%
are an illegal substance just like
heroin

05:12:39.288 --> 05:12:39.298 align:start position:0%
heroin
 
05:12:42.170 --> 05:12:42.180 align:start position:0%
um so uh you know what it does is uh it
 
05:12:45.110 --> 05:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
takes a a
 
05:12:47.810 --> 05:12:47.820 align:start position:0%
testosterone level prior to employment
 
05:12:51.590 --> 05:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
and uh you know then uh you know say if
 
05:12:54.830 --> 05:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
you at 22 years old your testosterone
 
05:12:56.448 --> 05:12:56.458 align:start position:0%
levels here and if you're at 40 years
 
05:12:57.770 --> 05:12:57.780 align:start position:0%
old and you're all poofed up and all
 
05:13:00.050 --> 05:13:00.060 align:start position:0%
muscle bound and you and you you know
 
05:13:01.850 --> 05:13:01.860 align:start position:0%
you rub somebody up and you testosterone
 
05:13:03.410 --> 05:13:03.420 align:start position:0%
levels are up here something's going on
 
05:13:07.368 --> 05:13:07.378 align:start position:0%
and uh you know we want to stop that
 
05:13:10.070 --> 05:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
um you know it's um
 
05:13:12.110 --> 05:13:12.120 align:start position:0%
once again it's a it's an antidote to a
 
05:13:15.110 --> 05:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
problem that uh that doesn't exist in a
 
05:13:17.090 --> 05:13:17.100 align:start position:0%
big way in New Hampshire but I'm sure it
 
05:13:19.070 --> 05:13:19.080 align:start position:0%
does you know there's just way too many
 
05:13:24.010 --> 05:13:24.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:26.090 --> 05:13:26.100 align:start position:0%
thank you representative over there I
 
05:13:28.490 --> 05:13:28.500 align:start position:0%
don't see any questions representative
 
05:13:28.500 --> 05:13:30.410 align:start position:0%
don't see any questions representative
Murray

05:13:30.410 --> 05:13:30.420 align:start position:0%
Murray
 
05:13:32.510 --> 05:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
05:13:34.010 --> 05:13:34.020 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
05:13:35.750 --> 05:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
um if I heard you correctly I think you
 
05:13:38.628 --> 05:13:38.638 align:start position:0%
said that officers who are on steroids
 
05:13:41.830 --> 05:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
are more likely to partake in violence
 
05:13:45.288 --> 05:13:45.298 align:start position:0%
yes it's pretty well proven okay yeah I
 
05:13:46.970 --> 05:13:46.980 align:start position:0%
was just curious if there was like data
 
05:13:48.350 --> 05:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
that backs that up that you could share
 
05:13:54.590 --> 05:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:56.990 --> 05:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
I I was actually thinking you were still
 
05:13:58.730 --> 05:13:58.740 align:start position:0%
answering her question representative
 
05:13:58.740 --> 05:14:00.590 align:start position:0%
answering her question representative
Newman

05:14:00.590 --> 05:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
Newman
 
05:14:03.650 --> 05:14:03.660 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and so it's just a
 
05:14:06.590 --> 05:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
follow-up to that question so if from my
 
05:14:09.288 --> 05:14:09.298 align:start position:0%
reading of this bill it means that if
 
05:14:13.610 --> 05:14:13.620 align:start position:0%
they are if the officer gets a does it
 
05:14:16.070 --> 05:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
does not detect that he's using steroids
 
05:14:19.010 --> 05:14:19.020 align:start position:0%
or if he is using steroids he has a
 
05:14:21.948 --> 05:14:21.958 align:start position:0%
medical prescription for that and that
 
05:14:24.590 --> 05:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
person who would just be deemed that the
 
05:14:26.810 --> 05:14:26.820 align:start position:0%
force that he used was not excessive is
 
05:14:29.750 --> 05:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
that correct yes um you know if it
 
05:14:32.270 --> 05:14:32.280 align:start position:0%
medically supervised animal anabolic
 
05:14:34.610 --> 05:14:34.620 align:start position:0%
steroid use or even just regular steroid
 
05:14:36.650 --> 05:14:36.660 align:start position:0%
usually for something like Ed you know
 
05:14:38.570 --> 05:14:38.580 align:start position:0%
it happens with a lot of guys uh you
 
05:14:39.910 --> 05:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
know you you start
 
05:14:42.230 --> 05:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
your testosterone levels don't go off
 
05:14:47.750 --> 05:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:52.910 --> 05:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:05.810 --> 05:15:05.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:07.250 --> 05:15:07.260 align:start position:0%
hello Madam chairman members of
 
05:15:09.050 --> 05:15:09.060 align:start position:0%
committee thank you again
 
05:15:10.970 --> 05:15:10.980 align:start position:0%
um the nhpa New Hampshire Police
 
05:15:12.230 --> 05:15:12.240 align:start position:0%
Association asked me to speak on this
 
05:15:12.240 --> 05:15:13.490 align:start position:0%
Association asked me to speak on this
bill

05:15:13.490 --> 05:15:13.500 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:15:13.500 --> 05:15:14.330 align:start position:0%
bill
um

05:15:14.330 --> 05:15:14.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:16.128 --> 05:15:16.138 align:start position:0%
so there's two parts to this bill the
 
05:15:17.628 --> 05:15:17.638 align:start position:0%
first part that I'm going to speak about
 
05:15:20.810 --> 05:15:20.820 align:start position:0%
briefly amends 106 L6 talking about
 
05:15:23.288 --> 05:15:23.298 align:start position:0%
hiring at the Academy
 
05:15:26.690 --> 05:15:26.700 align:start position:0%
to test for anabolic anabolic anabolic
 
05:15:28.670 --> 05:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
and testosterone boosting steroids the
 
05:15:30.288 --> 05:15:30.298 align:start position:0%
nhp doesn't have a position on this
 
05:15:30.298 --> 05:15:31.730 align:start position:0%
nhp doesn't have a position on this
however

05:15:31.730 --> 05:15:31.740 align:start position:0%
however
 
05:15:34.070 --> 05:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
I will state
 
05:15:36.288 --> 05:15:36.298 align:start position:0%
um that any competent background
 
05:15:39.170 --> 05:15:39.180 align:start position:0%
investigation is going to detect or I'm
 
05:15:40.910 --> 05:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
sorry the background investigator is
 
05:15:42.170 --> 05:15:42.180 align:start position:0%
going to learn that a person's on
 
05:15:44.448 --> 05:15:44.458 align:start position:0%
anabolic steroids well in advance of
 
05:15:46.310 --> 05:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
them even getting to the drug screening
 
05:15:49.010 --> 05:15:49.020 align:start position:0%
and probably disqualify that candidate
 
05:15:50.628 --> 05:15:50.638 align:start position:0%
but I'll leave that we don't have a
 
05:15:53.208 --> 05:15:53.218 align:start position:0%
position on it the next portion is the
 
05:15:54.890 --> 05:15:54.900 align:start position:0%
creation of a new RSA
 
05:15:58.610 --> 05:15:58.620 align:start position:0%
RSA 105 colon 20. drug screening for the
 
05:16:00.590 --> 05:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
use of excessive force complaints
 
05:16:03.230 --> 05:16:03.240 align:start position:0%
this bill proposes to require drug
 
05:16:05.330 --> 05:16:05.340 align:start position:0%
screening for anabolic steroids and
 
05:16:07.610 --> 05:16:07.620 align:start position:0%
testosterone boosting steroids for any
 
05:16:08.990 --> 05:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
officer who's the subject of an
 
05:16:10.550 --> 05:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
excessive force complaint
 
05:16:12.470 --> 05:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
the statute doesn't Define what an
 
05:16:14.930 --> 05:16:14.940 align:start position:0%
excessive force complaint is
 
05:16:17.090 --> 05:16:17.100 align:start position:0%
um I would say that any Force any use of
 
05:16:18.650 --> 05:16:18.660 align:start position:0%
force complaint is an excessive force
 
05:16:20.390 --> 05:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
complaint whether someone believed they
 
05:16:21.590 --> 05:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
should have been arrested or not and
 
05:16:24.050 --> 05:16:24.060 align:start position:0%
they file a complaint that he handcuffed
 
05:16:26.150 --> 05:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
me roughly that's now an excessive force
 
05:16:26.990 --> 05:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
complaint that's going to have to be
 
05:16:29.150 --> 05:16:29.160 align:start position:0%
investigated and now vis-a-vis the
 
05:16:31.070 --> 05:16:31.080 align:start position:0%
officer is going to have to have a
 
05:16:32.868 --> 05:16:32.878 align:start position:0%
steroid test we don't know who's going
 
05:16:35.868 --> 05:16:35.878 align:start position:0%
to pay for it I'm assuming the town will
 
05:16:35.878 --> 05:16:37.490 align:start position:0%
to pay for it I'm assuming the town will
um

05:16:37.490 --> 05:16:37.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:39.590 --> 05:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
does that mean well let me continue I'm
 
05:16:39.600 --> 05:16:40.788 align:start position:0%
does that mean well let me continue I'm
sorry

05:16:40.788 --> 05:16:40.798 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
05:16:41.990 --> 05:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
um even those complaints that are
 
05:16:44.448 --> 05:16:44.458 align:start position:0%
demonstrably false so law enforcement
 
05:16:46.390 --> 05:16:46.400 align:start position:0%
agencies are required or they should be
 
05:16:48.708 --> 05:16:48.718 align:start position:0%
in taking complaints whether they're
 
05:16:51.770 --> 05:16:51.780 align:start position:0%
Anonymous or not and investigating them
 
05:16:54.770 --> 05:16:54.780 align:start position:0%
so an anonymous complaint sent in on a
 
05:16:56.868 --> 05:16:56.878 align:start position:0%
handwritten letter that no one signed
 
05:17:00.650 --> 05:17:00.660 align:start position:0%
saying officer x uh punched me is a
 
05:17:01.368 --> 05:17:01.378 align:start position:0%
complaint that we're gonna have to
 
05:17:02.810 --> 05:17:02.820 align:start position:0%
investigate now we're gonna have to send
 
05:17:05.390 --> 05:17:05.400 align:start position:0%
officer acts to get a steroid test or
 
05:17:07.970 --> 05:17:07.980 align:start position:0%
officer y uh punched me we look at the
 
05:17:09.650 --> 05:17:09.660 align:start position:0%
body cam footage he didn't even touch
 
05:17:11.390 --> 05:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
the person now we have to go send them
 
05:17:13.190 --> 05:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
to get a steroid test there's no
 
05:17:14.930 --> 05:17:14.940 align:start position:0%
exception here if it demonstrably false
 
05:17:17.990 --> 05:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
complaints what about a Google review
 
05:17:20.510 --> 05:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
what if someone gets on Google and says
 
05:17:22.448 --> 05:17:22.458 align:start position:0%
Officer Jason Smith at the Salem PD
 
05:17:24.350 --> 05:17:24.360 align:start position:0%
punched me
 
05:17:25.550 --> 05:17:25.560 align:start position:0%
well now I'm gonna have to go get a
 
05:17:26.750 --> 05:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
steroid test because this bill doesn't
 
05:17:28.788 --> 05:17:28.798 align:start position:0%
allow for any exception now that we're
 
05:17:30.530 --> 05:17:30.540 align:start position:0%
going to investigate it
 
05:17:30.540 --> 05:17:32.330 align:start position:0%
going to investigate it
um

05:17:32.330 --> 05:17:32.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:34.670 --> 05:17:34.680 align:start position:0%
so let's bring it down to the logical
 
05:17:34.680 --> 05:17:36.590 align:start position:0%
so let's bring it down to the logical
conclusion

05:17:36.590 --> 05:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
conclusion
 
05:17:39.590 --> 05:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
a subject outside a bar spits in the
 
05:17:41.448 --> 05:17:41.458 align:start position:0%
face of an officer it takes three
 
05:17:43.070 --> 05:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
officers to tackle that person bring
 
05:17:44.330 --> 05:17:44.340 align:start position:0%
them to the ground
 
05:17:46.310 --> 05:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
he's not hurt
 
05:17:49.970 --> 05:17:49.980 align:start position:0%
all three officers the suspect defendant
 
05:17:52.010 --> 05:17:52.020 align:start position:0%
files a complaint against them they used
 
05:17:53.868 --> 05:17:53.878 align:start position:0%
excessive force whether it's
 
05:17:55.070 --> 05:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
demonstrably false or not because
 
05:17:56.270 --> 05:17:56.280 align:start position:0%
there's no exception in this language
 
05:17:58.368 --> 05:17:58.378 align:start position:0%
all three officers including one that
 
05:18:00.288 --> 05:18:00.298 align:start position:0%
might be a pregnant female is now going
 
05:18:03.170 --> 05:18:03.180 align:start position:0%
to have to go get a steroid test
 
05:18:05.330 --> 05:18:05.340 align:start position:0%
um and there's no exception for that
 
05:18:05.340 --> 05:18:06.350 align:start position:0%
um and there's no exception for that
um

05:18:06.350 --> 05:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:10.430 --> 05:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
unlike the language to change 106 L6
 
05:18:12.230 --> 05:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
there's no provision
 
05:18:15.530 --> 05:18:15.540 align:start position:0%
in the proposed statute that deals with
 
05:18:18.050 --> 05:18:18.060 align:start position:0%
people that have a prescription in 2004
 
05:18:20.090 --> 05:18:20.100 align:start position:0%
I was diagnosed with a pituitary tumor
 
05:18:22.430 --> 05:18:22.440 align:start position:0%
I've had two surgeries in radiation and
 
05:18:24.050 --> 05:18:24.060 align:start position:0%
I'm on testosterone for the rest of my
 
05:18:26.448 --> 05:18:26.458 align:start position:0%
life among other drugs so if I have a
 
05:18:28.310 --> 05:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
use of force I'm gonna go get a test
 
05:18:30.350 --> 05:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
that's going to prove I have a medically
 
05:18:30.360 --> 05:18:31.430 align:start position:0%
that's going to prove I have a medically
included

05:18:31.430 --> 05:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
included
 
05:18:33.288 --> 05:18:33.298 align:start position:0%
prescription that I'm taking what's the
 
05:18:35.570 --> 05:18:35.580 align:start position:0%
point of that there is no point
 
05:18:35.580 --> 05:18:36.350 align:start position:0%
point of that there is no point
um

05:18:36.350 --> 05:18:36.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:37.670 --> 05:18:37.680 align:start position:0%
finally I'm just going to end with this
 
05:18:40.670 --> 05:18:40.680 align:start position:0%
prices square root law
 
05:18:41.868 --> 05:18:41.878 align:start position:0%
states that the number of people
 
05:18:44.570 --> 05:18:44.580 align:start position:0%
involved in a project or business
 
05:18:46.368 --> 05:18:46.378 align:start position:0%
um will be the square root of the number
 
05:18:48.890 --> 05:18:48.900 align:start position:0%
of people are responsible for 50 of the
 
05:18:50.510 --> 05:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
work if you equate that to law
 
05:18:50.520 --> 05:18:51.830 align:start position:0%
work if you equate that to law
enforcement

05:18:51.830 --> 05:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
05:18:53.810 --> 05:18:53.820 align:start position:0%
every agency has a group of officers
 
05:18:56.390 --> 05:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
that are perhaps more productive or
 
05:18:59.090 --> 05:18:59.100 align:start position:0%
engaging with the criminal element
 
05:19:00.650 --> 05:19:00.660 align:start position:0%
these are individuals with the most
 
05:19:03.590 --> 05:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
arrests the most activity
 
05:19:05.510 --> 05:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
and they're also the usually the ones
 
05:19:07.430 --> 05:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
with the most use of force complaints
 
05:19:09.288 --> 05:19:09.298 align:start position:0%
does that mean
 
05:19:11.930 --> 05:19:11.940 align:start position:0%
they're on steroids no
 
05:19:15.050 --> 05:19:15.060 align:start position:0%
does that mean they're bad officers no
 
05:19:16.368 --> 05:19:16.378 align:start position:0%
does that mean they're doing anything
 
05:19:18.470 --> 05:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
wrong no
 
05:19:20.628 --> 05:19:20.638 align:start position:0%
what it actually means is that these
 
05:19:21.948 --> 05:19:21.958 align:start position:0%
officers are making a difference in
 
05:19:23.750 --> 05:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
making New Hampshire safer
 
05:19:25.970 --> 05:19:25.980 align:start position:0%
all this bill does is to seek to crush
 
05:19:27.708 --> 05:19:27.718 align:start position:0%
their spirit
 
05:19:29.448 --> 05:19:29.458 align:start position:0%
of these hard-working officers and
 
05:19:31.910 --> 05:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
that's why the nhpa is adamantly opposed
 
05:19:35.990 --> 05:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:37.910 --> 05:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
representative Murray
 
05:19:39.590 --> 05:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
05:19:42.170 --> 05:19:42.180 align:start position:0%
taking my question I was just curious I
 
05:19:44.270 --> 05:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
have no idea what a steroid test entails
 
05:19:45.650 --> 05:19:45.660 align:start position:0%
is that something that's like personally
 
05:19:47.510 --> 05:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
invasive and is it also something that's
 
05:19:47.520 --> 05:19:49.788 align:start position:0%
invasive and is it also something that's
costly

05:19:49.788 --> 05:19:49.798 align:start position:0%
costly
 
05:19:52.070 --> 05:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
I appreciate the question ma'am I my
 
05:19:54.288 --> 05:19:54.298 align:start position:0%
brother's a doctor I am not I would
 
05:19:56.030 --> 05:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
assume it's urine maybe blood I honestly
 
05:19:57.890 --> 05:19:57.900 align:start position:0%
don't know I I do know that drug
 
05:19:59.628 --> 05:19:59.638 align:start position:0%
screening tends to be expensive but I I
 
05:20:01.310 --> 05:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
I don't want to speak out of something I
 
05:20:03.530 --> 05:20:03.540 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
05:20:06.368 --> 05:20:06.378 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:20:08.590 --> 05:20:08.600 align:start position:0%
I can call my brother
 
05:20:10.910 --> 05:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
we have a couple other people testifying
 
05:20:11.930 --> 05:20:11.940 align:start position:0%
I'm sure I'll be able to get that
 
05:20:14.510 --> 05:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
question answered uh is there anybody
 
05:20:15.948 --> 05:20:15.958 align:start position:0%
else though see no further questions
 
05:20:18.890 --> 05:20:18.900 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
05:20:28.970 --> 05:20:28.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:32.208 --> 05:20:32.218 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh thank you uh
 
05:20:34.010 --> 05:20:34.020 align:start position:0%
committee members uh for the record my
 
05:20:35.510 --> 05:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
name is John skip I'm the director of
 
05:20:36.650 --> 05:20:36.660 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire police standards and
 
05:20:39.050 --> 05:20:39.060 align:start position:0%
training and with me is Captain Adam
 
05:20:41.090 --> 05:20:41.100 align:start position:0%
Hawkins of police sandwich and training
 
05:20:44.628 --> 05:20:44.638 align:start position:0%
and uh uh I'll start by trying to answer
 
05:20:47.350 --> 05:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
your question representative Murray uh
 
05:20:51.890 --> 05:20:51.900 align:start position:0%
to test first uh testosterone or uh
 
05:20:54.530 --> 05:20:54.540 align:start position:0%
anabolic steroids it would require blood
 
05:20:57.948 --> 05:20:57.958 align:start position:0%
draw and the cost of that test is right
 
05:20:57.958 --> 05:20:58.930 align:start position:0%
draw and the cost of that test is right
around

05:20:58.930 --> 05:20:58.940 align:start position:0%
around
 
05:21:05.628 --> 05:21:05.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:05.638 --> 05:21:07.610 align:start position:0%
 
uh

05:21:07.610 --> 05:21:07.620 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:21:10.788 --> 05:21:10.798 align:start position:0%
I am here to uh we are here to uh
 
05:21:14.570 --> 05:21:14.580 align:start position:0%
testify in opposition to this bill as it
 
05:21:15.890 --> 05:21:15.900 align:start position:0%
is written
 
05:21:19.430 --> 05:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh let me take the second part first and
 
05:21:23.930 --> 05:21:23.940 align:start position:0%
then the the first part uh second
 
05:21:27.590 --> 05:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
with regard to the uh proposed amendment
 
05:21:32.090 --> 05:21:32.100 align:start position:0%
to RSA 106 L6 Roman numeral 4.
 
05:21:35.628 --> 05:21:35.638 align:start position:0%
it uh asks that uh
 
05:21:38.270 --> 05:21:38.280 align:start position:0%
the drug screening shall include
 
05:21:40.788 --> 05:21:40.798 align:start position:0%
screening for Annabelle anabolic or
 
05:21:43.970 --> 05:21:43.980 align:start position:0%
testosterone boosting steroids uh with a
 
05:21:47.750 --> 05:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
caveat that it does allow the officer to
 
05:21:50.750 --> 05:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
or the candidate to be prescribed those
 
05:21:53.270 --> 05:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
drugs in which case it's not an issue
 
05:21:55.490 --> 05:21:55.500 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that this needs to be
 
05:21:58.330 --> 05:21:58.340 align:start position:0%
captured in statute
 
05:22:00.590 --> 05:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
police standards and training Council
 
05:22:02.628 --> 05:22:02.638 align:start position:0%
has statutory authority to set the
 
05:22:04.430 --> 05:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
hiring standards to include physical
 
05:22:06.890 --> 05:22:06.900 align:start position:0%
fitness tests medical tests any other
 
05:22:09.110 --> 05:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
requirements to certify a police officer
 
05:22:13.850 --> 05:22:13.860 align:start position:0%
so we can very easily include excuse me
 
05:22:16.970 --> 05:22:16.980 align:start position:0%
include anabolic steroids and
 
05:22:19.970 --> 05:22:19.980 align:start position:0%
testosterone boosting steroids as part
 
05:22:22.910 --> 05:22:22.920 align:start position:0%
of our existing drug screen that would
 
05:22:26.030 --> 05:22:26.040 align:start position:0%
be very easy to do by just capturing it
 
05:22:29.930 --> 05:22:29.940 align:start position:0%
in our administrative rules and
 
05:22:33.650 --> 05:22:33.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:37.850 --> 05:22:37.860 align:start position:0%
uh the last part of 106 l
 
05:22:40.670 --> 05:22:40.680 align:start position:0%
six Roman numeral four which is proposed
 
05:22:43.030 --> 05:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
in this legislation
 
05:22:46.128 --> 05:22:46.138 align:start position:0%
asks that the council shall forward the
 
05:22:47.930 --> 05:22:47.940 align:start position:0%
results of the drug screening to the
 
05:22:50.090 --> 05:22:50.100 align:start position:0%
officers employing agency and the
 
05:22:51.948 --> 05:22:51.958 align:start position:0%
employing agency shall rescind the
 
05:22:51.958 --> 05:22:53.570 align:start position:0%
employing agency shall rescind the
employment

05:22:53.570 --> 05:22:53.580 align:start position:0%
employment
 
05:22:57.170 --> 05:22:57.180 align:start position:0%
and to be clear New Hampshire police
 
05:22:59.930 --> 05:22:59.940 align:start position:0%
citizen training does not receive the
 
05:23:02.810 --> 05:23:02.820 align:start position:0%
results of any drug screens that we
 
05:23:04.430 --> 05:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
mandate now
 
05:23:07.310 --> 05:23:07.320 align:start position:0%
and this proposed legislation would
 
05:23:09.288 --> 05:23:09.298 align:start position:0%
require that now the council would have
 
05:23:12.170 --> 05:23:12.180 align:start position:0%
to receive that medical information that
 
05:23:15.650 --> 05:23:15.660 align:start position:0%
we we don't ask for right now
 
05:23:19.250 --> 05:23:19.260 align:start position:0%
and uh and then it's it's kind of
 
05:23:22.670 --> 05:23:22.680 align:start position:0%
written in a way that it proposes that
 
05:23:26.628 --> 05:23:26.638 align:start position:0%
this officer is then going to be fired
 
05:23:28.128 --> 05:23:28.138 align:start position:0%
from their job
 
05:23:32.208 --> 05:23:32.218 align:start position:0%
because of that uh
 
05:23:34.910 --> 05:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
I guess positive test
 
05:23:37.490 --> 05:23:37.500 align:start position:0%
the reality of it is we police citizen
 
05:23:39.110 --> 05:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
training does not get involved in
 
05:23:41.628 --> 05:23:41.638 align:start position:0%
employment issues we get involved with
 
05:23:44.030 --> 05:23:44.040 align:start position:0%
regulatory issues with the licensing the
 
05:23:46.910 --> 05:23:46.920 align:start position:0%
certification of an officer
 
05:23:50.150 --> 05:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
and so it would be more accurate to
 
05:23:52.670 --> 05:23:52.680 align:start position:0%
reflect that the certification would not
 
05:23:56.150 --> 05:23:56.160 align:start position:0%
be issued in the first instance
 
05:23:56.160 --> 05:23:57.948 align:start position:0%
be issued in the first instance
again

05:23:57.948 --> 05:23:57.958 align:start position:0%
again
 
05:24:00.708 --> 05:24:00.718 align:start position:0%
I can work with representative love to
 
05:24:02.510 --> 05:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
to work this into our administrative
 
05:24:03.770 --> 05:24:03.780 align:start position:0%
rules I don't think it needs any
 
05:24:03.780 --> 05:24:06.410 align:start position:0%
rules I don't think it needs any
legislation

05:24:06.410 --> 05:24:06.420 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
05:24:06.420 --> 05:24:09.110 align:start position:0%
legislation
um

05:24:09.110 --> 05:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:11.930 --> 05:24:11.940 align:start position:0%
and this would be for hiring purposes so
 
05:24:13.910 --> 05:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
we would just add this schedule 3 drug
 
05:24:17.150 --> 05:24:17.160 align:start position:0%
which is uh anabolic steroids are
 
05:24:18.830 --> 05:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
considered a schedule three drug they're
 
05:24:21.350 --> 05:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
illegal unless of course you have a
 
05:24:21.360 --> 05:24:25.070 align:start position:0%
illegal unless of course you have a
prescription

05:24:25.070 --> 05:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:30.128 --> 05:24:30.138 align:start position:0%
with regard to the addition of 105 20.
 
05:24:33.650 --> 05:24:33.660 align:start position:0%
and much to the captain's testimony from
 
05:24:33.660 --> 05:24:35.090 align:start position:0%
and much to the captain's testimony from
Salem

05:24:35.090 --> 05:24:35.100 align:start position:0%
Salem
 
05:24:38.810 --> 05:24:38.820 align:start position:0%
it does create
 
05:24:42.170 --> 05:24:42.180 align:start position:0%
a situation where there is no due
 
05:24:42.180 --> 05:24:43.490 align:start position:0%
a situation where there is no due
process

05:24:43.490 --> 05:24:43.500 align:start position:0%
process
 
05:24:45.890 --> 05:24:45.900 align:start position:0%
for the officer that has had this
 
05:24:48.890 --> 05:24:48.900 align:start position:0%
allegation made against them
 
05:24:52.208 --> 05:24:52.218 align:start position:0%
and in fact uh it is a very invasive
 
05:24:54.770 --> 05:24:54.780 align:start position:0%
requires a blood test
 
05:24:57.050 --> 05:24:57.060 align:start position:0%
and I think it's important for the this
 
05:24:59.810 --> 05:24:59.820 align:start position:0%
committee to understand that uh if it
 
05:25:01.610 --> 05:25:01.620 align:start position:0%
were the other way around where the
 
05:25:04.190 --> 05:25:04.200 align:start position:0%
police had a reason to believe that
 
05:25:06.890 --> 05:25:06.900 align:start position:0%
maybe you were under the influence of
 
05:25:09.530 --> 05:25:09.540 align:start position:0%
uh alcoholic beverages and you got in a
 
05:25:11.470 --> 05:25:11.480 align:start position:0%
car accident
 
05:25:15.110 --> 05:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
we cannot unilaterally just bring you to
 
05:25:16.970 --> 05:25:16.980 align:start position:0%
the hospital and say roll your sleeve up
 
05:25:19.128 --> 05:25:19.138 align:start position:0%
and we're going to take a blood test to
 
05:25:21.650 --> 05:25:21.660 align:start position:0%
to check your alcohol level because
 
05:25:23.628 --> 05:25:23.638 align:start position:0%
we're alleging that you were you're
 
05:25:25.850 --> 05:25:25.860 align:start position:0%
probably driving drunk
 
05:25:28.190 --> 05:25:28.200 align:start position:0%
we have to either get your permission to
 
05:25:30.288 --> 05:25:30.298 align:start position:0%
do that or we have to get a warrant
 
05:25:33.470 --> 05:25:33.480 align:start position:0%
based on facts and circumstances that
 
05:25:35.030 --> 05:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
would lead to believe that there's
 
05:25:38.270 --> 05:25:38.280 align:start position:0%
probable cause that you have this in
 
05:25:39.890 --> 05:25:39.900 align:start position:0%
your system and we're trying to gather
 
05:25:42.230 --> 05:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
that as evidence
 
05:25:44.708 --> 05:25:44.718 align:start position:0%
finally I would suggest this
 
05:25:48.770 --> 05:25:48.780 align:start position:0%
if there is an allegation of a police
 
05:25:52.128 --> 05:25:52.138 align:start position:0%
officer using excessive force
 
05:25:53.868 --> 05:25:53.878 align:start position:0%
the investigation is going to
 
05:25:55.850 --> 05:25:55.860 align:start position:0%
concentrate on
 
05:25:58.490 --> 05:25:58.500 align:start position:0%
the facts and circumstances
 
05:26:00.470 --> 05:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
of what that
 
05:26:03.590 --> 05:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
excessive force may have been we're
 
05:26:06.170 --> 05:26:06.180 align:start position:0%
gonna we're gonna talk to the people
 
05:26:07.250 --> 05:26:07.260 align:start position:0%
involved we're going to talk to
 
05:26:08.570 --> 05:26:08.580 align:start position:0%
Witnesses we're going to talk to the
 
05:26:10.070 --> 05:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
officers we're going to look at body
 
05:26:11.390 --> 05:26:11.400 align:start position:0%
camera we're going to look at other
 
05:26:14.030 --> 05:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
cameras from other areas
 
05:26:15.890 --> 05:26:15.900 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day
 
05:26:18.530 --> 05:26:18.540 align:start position:0%
whether any of the officers have
 
05:26:21.590 --> 05:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
anabolic steroids in their system or
 
05:26:23.810 --> 05:26:23.820 align:start position:0%
whether they have insulin in their
 
05:26:25.910 --> 05:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
system or whether they took a
 
05:26:28.250 --> 05:26:28.260 align:start position:0%
multivitamin that morning
 
05:26:31.490 --> 05:26:31.500 align:start position:0%
uh is not going to have any real direct
 
05:26:34.610 --> 05:26:34.620 align:start position:0%
bearing on whether the investigation
 
05:26:37.730 --> 05:26:37.740 align:start position:0%
will bear out or sustain that the
 
05:26:41.270 --> 05:26:41.280 align:start position:0%
officer or officers used excessive and
 
05:26:44.208 --> 05:26:44.218 align:start position:0%
unnecessary Force if that if that makes
 
05:26:49.850 --> 05:26:49.860 align:start position:0%
sense this bill is suggesting that uh if
 
05:26:54.110 --> 05:26:54.120 align:start position:0%
this then that and uh I don't know that
 
05:26:54.120 --> 05:26:55.810 align:start position:0%
this then that and uh I don't know that
uh

05:26:55.810 --> 05:26:55.820 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:26:58.190 --> 05:26:58.200 align:start position:0%
determining that
 
05:27:00.708 --> 05:27:00.718 align:start position:0%
the officer had any level of anabolic
 
05:27:03.230 --> 05:27:03.240 align:start position:0%
steroids in their system
 
05:27:05.230 --> 05:27:05.240 align:start position:0%
is going to help
 
05:27:09.050 --> 05:27:09.060 align:start position:0%
substantiate or exonerate an allegation
 
05:27:11.410 --> 05:27:11.420 align:start position:0%
of excessive force
 
05:27:14.690 --> 05:27:14.700 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to offer uh
 
05:27:17.030 --> 05:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
that information I certainly stand ready
 
05:27:19.550 --> 05:27:19.560 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions and again I look
 
05:27:20.810 --> 05:27:20.820 align:start position:0%
forward to working with representative
 
05:27:23.930 --> 05:27:23.940 align:start position:0%
love on the in the first part of
 
05:27:23.940 --> 05:27:24.650 align:start position:0%
love on the in the first part of
um

05:27:24.650 --> 05:27:24.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:27:28.368 --> 05:27:28.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:29.990 --> 05:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
Senator Newman
 
05:27:32.628 --> 05:27:32.638 align:start position:0%
so thank you madam chair and I just have
 
05:27:34.250 --> 05:27:34.260 align:start position:0%
a quick question for the example you
 
05:27:36.830 --> 05:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
gave about DWI and obtaining the results
 
05:27:40.850 --> 05:27:40.860 align:start position:0%
of such a blood test and it might not
 
05:27:43.910 --> 05:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
pertain exactly to this bill but if if
 
05:27:46.490 --> 05:27:46.500 align:start position:0%
in that example that you gave if the
 
05:27:49.190 --> 05:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
individual that you were alleging was
 
05:27:50.930 --> 05:27:50.940 align:start position:0%
guilty of DWI
 
05:27:53.448 --> 05:27:53.458 align:start position:0%
was injured in the hospital drew blood
 
05:27:56.150 --> 05:27:56.160 align:start position:0%
from that individual with the police
 
05:28:00.590 --> 05:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
would the of police or whatever have
 
05:28:02.330 --> 05:28:02.340 align:start position:0%
access to that or where they need a
 
05:28:04.190 --> 05:28:04.200 align:start position:0%
warrant for that or how does that work
 
05:28:06.470 --> 05:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
they would need a warrant in order to
 
05:28:09.350 --> 05:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
obtain those medically drawn samples to
 
05:28:15.288 --> 05:28:15.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:16.670 --> 05:28:16.680 align:start position:0%
saying no further questions thank you
 
05:28:20.090 --> 05:28:20.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:21.948 --> 05:28:21.958 align:start position:0%
is there anybody else wishing to testify
 
05:28:23.448 --> 05:28:23.458 align:start position:0%
in this bill that has not turned in a
 
05:28:26.090 --> 05:28:26.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:28.190 --> 05:28:28.200 align:start position:0%
we will close the public hearing for
 
05:28:30.830 --> 05:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
House Bill 585
 
05:28:33.890 --> 05:28:33.900 align:start position:0%
and we will now open the public hearing
 
05:28:36.650 --> 05:28:36.660 align:start position:0%
for House Bill 593
 
05:28:38.090 --> 05:28:38.100 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:28:38.100 --> 05:28:41.750 align:start position:0%
thank you
and

05:28:41.750 --> 05:28:41.760 align:start position:0%

ladies and gentlemen if you wish to
 
05:28:44.520 --> 05:28:54.590 align:start position:0%
ladies and gentlemen if you wish to

all right excuse me if you wish to
 
05:29:02.810 --> 05:29:02.820 align:start position:0%
testify on House Bill 593 we are going
 
05:29:04.490 --> 05:29:04.500 align:start position:0%
to ask if you would please turn your
 
05:29:06.650 --> 05:29:06.660 align:start position:0%
card in now so that we can see how many
 
05:29:08.448 --> 05:29:08.458 align:start position:0%
people wish to testify so we can find
 
05:29:11.150 --> 05:29:11.160 align:start position:0%
out if we have to limit testimony
 
05:29:11.160 --> 05:30:01.810 align:start position:0%
out if we have to limit testimony
foreign

05:30:01.810 --> 05:30:01.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:04.610 --> 05:30:04.620 align:start position:0%
except for the for the prime sponsor
 
05:30:06.230 --> 05:30:06.240 align:start position:0%
we've discussed it and we are going to
 
05:30:08.868 --> 05:30:08.878 align:start position:0%
limit testimony to three minutes for um
 
05:30:10.910 --> 05:30:10.920 align:start position:0%
each person that wishes to testify at
 
05:30:13.310 --> 05:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
this time the committee recognizes
 
05:30:15.410 --> 05:30:15.420 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire
 
05:30:17.150 --> 05:30:17.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you members
 
05:30:18.470 --> 05:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record my name
 
05:30:20.390 --> 05:30:20.400 align:start position:0%
is Dan McGuire I represent the town of
 
05:30:22.128 --> 05:30:22.138 align:start position:0%
Epsom I will try to meet your
 
05:30:25.310 --> 05:30:25.320 align:start position:0%
three-minute limit as well
 
05:30:27.110 --> 05:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
um for those who are not familiar with
 
05:30:31.310 --> 05:30:31.320 align:start position:0%
asset forfeiture in drug crimes what it
 
05:30:33.708 --> 05:30:33.718 align:start position:0%
is it's a section of the law and
 
05:30:38.628 --> 05:30:38.638 align:start position:0%
specifically RSA 318b colon 17b
 
05:30:41.628 --> 05:30:41.638 align:start position:0%
um the concept is that when someone
 
05:30:45.470 --> 05:30:45.480 align:start position:0%
commits a drug crime not only are they
 
05:30:48.670 --> 05:30:48.680 align:start position:0%
subject to criminal penalties but also
 
05:30:51.350 --> 05:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
we don't want them to keep the the
 
05:30:53.810 --> 05:30:53.820 align:start position:0%
fruits of their crime the money they
 
05:30:56.628 --> 05:30:56.638 align:start position:0%
receive maybe from selling drugs and and
 
05:30:59.150 --> 05:30:59.160 align:start position:0%
also the the instruments of the crime so
 
05:31:02.090 --> 05:31:02.100 align:start position:0%
typically uh it's often a car right if
 
05:31:05.090 --> 05:31:05.100 align:start position:0%
the typical example is someone is
 
05:31:07.490 --> 05:31:07.500 align:start position:0%
arrested in a parking lot sitting in
 
05:31:09.770 --> 05:31:09.780 align:start position:0%
their car selling drugs and they're
 
05:31:12.650 --> 05:31:12.660 align:start position:0%
arrested with a bag of drugs and
 
05:31:16.430 --> 05:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
um and some cash and so they these law
 
05:31:18.770 --> 05:31:18.780 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers in that case will
 
05:31:21.288 --> 05:31:21.298 align:start position:0%
seize the drugs seize the cash and seize
 
05:31:25.128 --> 05:31:25.138 align:start position:0%
the car and arrest the person and so the
 
05:31:28.368 --> 05:31:28.378 align:start position:0%
question is so our law provides that
 
05:31:28.378 --> 05:31:29.350 align:start position:0%
question is so our law provides that
that

05:31:29.350 --> 05:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:31:33.530 --> 05:31:33.540 align:start position:0%
upon conviction those those items will
 
05:31:35.448 --> 05:31:35.458 align:start position:0%
be forfeited obviously the Contraband
 
05:31:37.090 --> 05:31:37.100 align:start position:0%
the drugs is always
 
05:31:39.050 --> 05:31:39.060 align:start position:0%
forfeited but
 
05:31:42.550 --> 05:31:42.560 align:start position:0%
um there's a there's a legal process to
 
05:31:46.190 --> 05:31:46.200 align:start position:0%
Forfeit the cash and the vehicles and
 
05:31:47.810 --> 05:31:47.820 align:start position:0%
whatever else might be involved in the
 
05:31:47.820 --> 05:31:48.830 align:start position:0%
whatever else might be involved in the
crime

05:31:48.830 --> 05:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
crime
 
05:31:48.840 --> 05:31:50.330 align:start position:0%
crime
so

05:31:50.330 --> 05:31:50.340 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:31:54.110 --> 05:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
um this bill so so about uh six or seven
 
05:31:58.010 --> 05:31:58.020 align:start position:0%
years ago we changed State policy such
 
05:32:01.128 --> 05:32:01.138 align:start position:0%
that what originally was the case was
 
05:32:03.530 --> 05:32:03.540 align:start position:0%
that the forfeiture action was a civil
 
05:32:06.288 --> 05:32:06.298 align:start position:0%
action separate from the criminal action
 
05:32:09.230 --> 05:32:09.240 align:start position:0%
for the drug crime and so they were
 
05:32:11.750 --> 05:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
tried separately they had different
 
05:32:15.890 --> 05:32:15.900 align:start position:0%
people involved Etc and so we we put in
 
05:32:19.310 --> 05:32:19.320 align:start position:0%
a policy that you can all forfeiture can
 
05:32:22.490 --> 05:32:22.500 align:start position:0%
only occur when conviction is achieved
 
05:32:24.708 --> 05:32:24.718 align:start position:0%
right because forfeiting your property
 
05:32:26.750 --> 05:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
losing your property is a kind of a
 
05:32:29.930 --> 05:32:29.940 align:start position:0%
penalty and so the concept is somebody
 
05:32:32.690 --> 05:32:32.700 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be penalized when they're not
 
05:32:36.110 --> 05:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
guilty of a crime and so in current law
 
05:32:39.350 --> 05:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
in this particular section in order for
 
05:32:41.990 --> 05:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
forfeiture to take place there must be a
 
05:32:42.000 --> 05:32:42.890 align:start position:0%
forfeiture to take place there must be a
conviction

05:32:42.890 --> 05:32:42.900 align:start position:0%
conviction
 
05:32:47.570 --> 05:32:47.580 align:start position:0%
okay however the problem is because of
 
05:32:50.150 --> 05:32:50.160 align:start position:0%
the way the process works people
 
05:32:52.788 --> 05:32:52.798 align:start position:0%
frequently don't even contend the
 
05:32:55.250 --> 05:32:55.260 align:start position:0%
forfeiture process so so there's certain
 
05:32:57.830 --> 05:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
details about it that that make it so
 
05:33:01.310 --> 05:33:01.320 align:start position:0%
that forfeitures are often just not even
 
05:33:03.708 --> 05:33:03.718 align:start position:0%
contented they're not nobody they just
 
05:33:06.350 --> 05:33:06.360 align:start position:0%
happen by default sort of and so what
 
05:33:10.310 --> 05:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
this bill does is it perfects the
 
05:33:13.850 --> 05:33:13.860 align:start position:0%
criminal Pro the the court process by
 
05:33:17.150 --> 05:33:17.160 align:start position:0%
which forfeiture takes place so it it
 
05:33:19.490 --> 05:33:19.500 align:start position:0%
instead of two separate kind of Court
 
05:33:22.670 --> 05:33:22.680 align:start position:0%
hearings two separate cases it combines
 
05:33:25.910 --> 05:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
it into a single case in the same court
 
05:33:27.948 --> 05:33:27.958 align:start position:0%
with the same judge and the same
 
05:33:31.190 --> 05:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
prosecutor in the same defense and makes
 
05:33:34.010 --> 05:33:34.020 align:start position:0%
it makes it kind of a a Serial process
 
05:33:37.030 --> 05:33:37.040 align:start position:0%
that that it goes in order so you first
 
05:33:39.650 --> 05:33:39.660 align:start position:0%
convict the person of a criminal offense
 
05:33:42.470 --> 05:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
and then you deal with the forfeiture in
 
05:33:44.270 --> 05:33:44.280 align:start position:0%
a similar way that you would deal with
 
05:33:46.250 --> 05:33:46.260 align:start position:0%
the penalties for the criminal offense
 
05:33:49.310 --> 05:33:49.320 align:start position:0%
assuming there's conviction the bill is
 
05:33:52.510 --> 05:33:52.520 align:start position:0%
quite detailed and long
 
05:33:55.910 --> 05:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
because there's a lot of special Corner
 
05:33:58.310 --> 05:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
cases right what if the car is owned by
 
05:34:00.650 --> 05:34:00.660 align:start position:0%
somebody else and not owned by the
 
05:34:03.050 --> 05:34:03.060 align:start position:0%
person who was arrested you know how do
 
05:34:04.970 --> 05:34:04.980 align:start position:0%
they prove their their innocence of the
 
05:34:07.010 --> 05:34:07.020 align:start position:0%
crime Etc et cetera so
 
05:34:08.690 --> 05:34:08.700 align:start position:0%
um so there's a lot of detail here
 
05:34:12.230 --> 05:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
looking at all those kind of cases
 
05:34:12.240 --> 05:34:12.770 align:start position:0%
looking at all those kind of cases
um

05:34:12.770 --> 05:34:12.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:12.780 --> 05:34:14.288 align:start position:0%
um
so

05:34:14.288 --> 05:34:14.298 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:34:18.170 --> 05:34:18.180 align:start position:0%
the the this bill
 
05:34:20.050 --> 05:34:20.060 align:start position:0%
um also
 
05:34:23.990 --> 05:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
instructs the uh prosecutors to make
 
05:34:27.350 --> 05:34:27.360 align:start position:0%
greater use of State law versus Federal
 
05:34:30.650 --> 05:34:30.660 align:start position:0%
law so drug crimes are crimes both of
 
05:34:32.628 --> 05:34:32.638 align:start position:0%
they're both federal crimes and state
 
05:34:35.750 --> 05:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
crimes and in some cases
 
05:34:39.050 --> 05:34:39.060 align:start position:0%
um the law enforcement has the option of
 
05:34:41.208 --> 05:34:41.218 align:start position:0%
charging somebody federally or charging
 
05:34:43.850 --> 05:34:43.860 align:start position:0%
somebody with State crimes this because
 
05:34:46.850 --> 05:34:46.860 align:start position:0%
we've improved our state law with this
 
05:34:48.368 --> 05:34:48.378 align:start position:0%
bill and others
 
05:34:52.128 --> 05:34:52.138 align:start position:0%
we want state law to be used and so this
 
05:34:55.930 --> 05:34:55.940 align:start position:0%
bill also directs a little bit less
 
05:34:58.850 --> 05:34:58.860 align:start position:0%
a little bit fewer prosecutions to be
 
05:35:00.650 --> 05:35:00.660 align:start position:0%
used in federal court and a little bit
 
05:35:03.170 --> 05:35:03.180 align:start position:0%
more to be used in State Court it still
 
05:35:05.690 --> 05:35:05.700 align:start position:0%
allows federal court to be used on the
 
05:35:08.690 --> 05:35:08.700 align:start position:0%
larger cases where federal agents are
 
05:35:11.090 --> 05:35:11.100 align:start position:0%
involved but in in cases where only
 
05:35:13.610 --> 05:35:13.620 align:start position:0%
state law enforcement has involved this
 
05:35:17.628 --> 05:35:17.638 align:start position:0%
bill directs that State Court be used
 
05:35:20.510 --> 05:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
um now the reason I have I've just
 
05:35:23.270 --> 05:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
handed out a very long amendment to a
 
05:35:25.310 --> 05:35:25.320 align:start position:0%
very long bill and I again I apologize
 
05:35:26.868 --> 05:35:26.878 align:start position:0%
for that but
 
05:35:30.230 --> 05:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
um we got the bill the original draft of
 
05:35:32.270 --> 05:35:32.280 align:start position:0%
the bill kind of late in the drafting
 
05:35:35.270 --> 05:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
process and since then
 
05:35:38.030 --> 05:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
um we've spent extensive time talking
 
05:35:40.070 --> 05:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
with representative of the Attorney
 
05:35:42.350 --> 05:35:42.360 align:start position:0%
General's office representative of the
 
05:35:45.530 --> 05:35:45.540 align:start position:0%
Judiciary uh Representative Bob Lin who
 
05:35:48.110 --> 05:35:48.120 align:start position:0%
you'll hear from who's the chair of the
 
05:35:51.410 --> 05:35:51.420 align:start position:0%
house Judiciary Committee and others and
 
05:35:54.170 --> 05:35:54.180 align:start position:0%
so we've made extensive revisions not to
 
05:35:56.628 --> 05:35:56.638 align:start position:0%
the goals of the bill which is again a
 
05:35:59.510 --> 05:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
single streamlined court process but to
 
05:36:01.670 --> 05:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
the details of exactly how that's done
 
05:36:03.890 --> 05:36:03.900 align:start position:0%
because we talked to a lot of people who
 
05:36:05.628 --> 05:36:05.638 align:start position:0%
have a lot of experience in this area
 
05:36:09.948 --> 05:36:09.958 align:start position:0%
and so on so just to conclude this bill
 
05:36:12.708 --> 05:36:12.718 align:start position:0%
does not affect law and what law
 
05:36:15.948 --> 05:36:15.958 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers do they still
 
05:36:17.570 --> 05:36:17.580 align:start position:0%
arrest people the same way they always
 
05:36:20.990 --> 05:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
did they still seize drugs and property
 
05:36:22.970 --> 05:36:22.980 align:start position:0%
and so on exactly as they already did
 
05:36:26.090 --> 05:36:26.100 align:start position:0%
this bill is about what happens in court
 
05:36:29.150 --> 05:36:29.160 align:start position:0%
after the fact how does the court
 
05:36:32.030 --> 05:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
process it makes it more efficient makes
 
05:36:34.430 --> 05:36:34.440 align:start position:0%
it fairer and comes to the right
 
05:36:36.530 --> 05:36:36.540 align:start position:0%
conclusion at the end of the day and I'm
 
05:36:41.330 --> 05:36:41.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:43.128 --> 05:36:43.138 align:start position:0%
representative Gendron
 
05:36:44.930 --> 05:36:44.940 align:start position:0%
thank you to the chair and and thank you
 
05:36:47.090 --> 05:36:47.100 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question uh
 
05:36:50.330 --> 05:36:50.340 align:start position:0%
I seem to remember remember in 2019 a
 
05:36:53.090 --> 05:36:53.100 align:start position:0%
very very very very similar bill
 
05:36:55.310 --> 05:36:55.320 align:start position:0%
before the house Judiciary Committee is
 
05:36:58.190 --> 05:36:58.200 align:start position:0%
this pretty much on that same premise
 
05:37:00.590 --> 05:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
um yes thank you for the question I I
 
05:37:02.448 --> 05:37:02.458 align:start position:0%
would say yes I was not a member of the
 
05:37:05.270 --> 05:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
House at the time but as far as I know
 
05:37:09.110 --> 05:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
in general yes although as I said this
 
05:37:13.330 --> 05:37:13.340 align:start position:0%
is a very detailed Bill and all of that
 
05:37:15.948 --> 05:37:15.958 align:start position:0%
discussion with all the various parties
 
05:37:19.128 --> 05:37:19.138 align:start position:0%
had not taken place at that time so so
 
05:37:22.070 --> 05:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of detail here that's more
 
05:37:24.770 --> 05:37:24.780 align:start position:0%
amenable to the attorney general and and
 
05:37:29.270 --> 05:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:29.280 --> 05:37:32.090 align:start position:0%
 
represent

05:37:32.090 --> 05:37:32.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:35.150 --> 05:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
ative thank you I have a question
 
05:37:36.948 --> 05:37:36.958 align:start position:0%
how do you determine when the federal
 
05:37:38.750 --> 05:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
government and the state government gets
 
05:37:40.550 --> 05:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
property seized
 
05:37:42.288 --> 05:37:42.298 align:start position:0%
many times both of them will be involved
 
05:37:45.288 --> 05:37:45.298 align:start position:0%
in the arrest well seizure that's up to
 
05:37:47.090 --> 05:37:47.100 align:start position:0%
law enforcement right so the question is
 
05:37:49.788 --> 05:37:49.798 align:start position:0%
when do you use federal law to prosecute
 
05:37:51.350 --> 05:37:51.360 align:start position:0%
these crimes and when do you use state
 
05:37:55.070 --> 05:37:55.080 align:start position:0%
law so basically what this says is if if
 
05:37:58.610 --> 05:37:58.620 align:start position:0%
at in involved in the case if no federal
 
05:38:02.150 --> 05:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
agents are involved in the case then use
 
05:38:05.030 --> 05:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
state law so if it's only local police
 
05:38:08.090 --> 05:38:08.100 align:start position:0%
state troopers Etc then we use state law
 
05:38:10.390 --> 05:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
if federal
 
05:38:12.890 --> 05:38:12.900 align:start position:0%
agents are involved in the case then
 
05:38:15.230 --> 05:38:15.240 align:start position:0%
they can make a decision whether to use
 
05:38:17.270 --> 05:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
you know all of the law enforcement
 
05:38:19.730 --> 05:38:19.740 align:start position:0%
involved it's typically kind of a joint
 
05:38:23.208 --> 05:38:23.218 align:start position:0%
state federal activity they can make a
 
05:38:25.128 --> 05:38:25.138 align:start position:0%
decision as to whether you say law which
 
05:38:27.050 --> 05:38:27.060 align:start position:0%
they frequently do in sort of smaller
 
05:38:29.510 --> 05:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
cases and in bigger cases they tend to
 
05:38:31.910 --> 05:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
use federal law
 
05:38:34.670 --> 05:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:36.770 --> 05:38:36.780 align:start position:0%
representative Muse
 
05:38:40.368 --> 05:38:40.378 align:start position:0%
uh yes uh nine page Amendment
 
05:38:44.750 --> 05:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
um and uh will you or anybody else who's
 
05:38:46.550 --> 05:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
testifying actually be able to walk us
 
05:38:48.770 --> 05:38:48.780 align:start position:0%
through some of the key changes and
 
05:38:48.780 --> 05:38:50.930 align:start position:0%
through some of the key changes and
differences

05:38:50.930 --> 05:38:50.940 align:start position:0%
differences
 
05:38:53.090 --> 05:38:53.100 align:start position:0%
um yes and I would I would prefer that
 
05:38:55.250 --> 05:38:55.260 align:start position:0%
not be me
 
05:38:58.310 --> 05:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
but the answer is yes
 
05:39:00.708 --> 05:39:00.718 align:start position:0%
um and and just to let you know Madam
 
05:39:00.718 --> 05:39:01.670 align:start position:0%
um and and just to let you know Madam

um my committee is about to have an exec
 
05:39:07.190 --> 05:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
session on Senate bill one which deals
 
05:39:09.230 --> 05:39:09.240 align:start position:0%
with the sununu youth center it's very
 
05:39:10.788 --> 05:39:10.798 align:start position:0%
important so I'm going to have to leave
 
05:39:12.948 --> 05:39:12.958 align:start position:0%
after my testimony and I would request
 
05:39:14.510 --> 05:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
that you take the other member of my
 
05:39:16.270 --> 05:39:16.280 align:start position:0%
committee my co-sponsor representative
 
05:39:19.310 --> 05:39:19.320 align:start position:0%
popovichi Mueller second it's because
 
05:39:22.128 --> 05:39:22.138 align:start position:0%
he's going to have to go as well so
 
05:39:24.350 --> 05:39:24.360 align:start position:0%
all right see no further questions thank
 
05:39:28.368 --> 05:39:28.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:33.590 --> 05:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:36.410 --> 05:39:36.420 align:start position:0%
uh what will you show up
 
05:39:38.570 --> 05:39:38.580 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I really appreciate
 
05:39:41.270 --> 05:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
it and I'm planning to stick to less
 
05:39:43.250 --> 05:39:43.260 align:start position:0%
than two minutes but I'm gonna use a few
 
05:39:45.708 --> 05:39:45.718 align:start position:0%
of the seconds that I'm saving by not uh
 
05:39:48.350 --> 05:39:48.360 align:start position:0%
using my third minute by thanking you
 
05:39:50.750 --> 05:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
for somehow miraculously going back on a
 
05:39:52.610 --> 05:39:52.620 align:start position:0%
schedule because the way this morning
 
05:39:55.070 --> 05:39:55.080 align:start position:0%
started that took a Hercules so I
 
05:39:57.110 --> 05:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
appreciate it for the record I'm a
 
05:39:58.910 --> 05:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
representative Daniel Popovich Mueller
 
05:40:02.810 --> 05:40:02.820 align:start position:0%
winham represented Rockingham 17 and I
 
05:40:04.970 --> 05:40:04.980 align:start position:0%
just want to bring your attention to a
 
05:40:06.590 --> 05:40:06.600 align:start position:0%
specific portion of the bill that would
 
05:40:10.010 --> 05:40:10.020 align:start position:0%
be on page 11 it's in paragraph in Roman
 
05:40:12.288 --> 05:40:12.298 align:start position:0%
numeral five the amendment or the actual
 
05:40:14.270 --> 05:40:14.280 align:start position:0%
bill in the amendment thank you the
 
05:40:16.010 --> 05:40:16.020 align:start position:0%
language is described the same but I
 
05:40:17.330 --> 05:40:17.340 align:start position:0%
would prefer obviously that we talk
 
05:40:19.730 --> 05:40:19.740 align:start position:0%
about the amendment that suggested that
 
05:40:22.610 --> 05:40:22.620 align:start position:0%
portion actually is unchanged in either
 
05:40:25.250 --> 05:40:25.260 align:start position:0%
and it's about what happens to the funds
 
05:40:27.470 --> 05:40:27.480 align:start position:0%
that do end up being
 
05:40:29.150 --> 05:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
05:40:32.570 --> 05:40:32.580 align:start position:0%
seized being forfeited the current law
 
05:40:35.090 --> 05:40:35.100 align:start position:0%
has a rather complex formula in which
 
05:40:36.948 --> 05:40:36.958 align:start position:0%
out of the first six hundred thousand a
 
05:40:38.930 --> 05:40:38.940 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand goes to a specific fund
 
05:40:41.270 --> 05:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
then you divide the remaining of the 600
 
05:40:44.090 --> 05:40:44.100 align:start position:0%
in three pieces then you look at the
 
05:40:46.190 --> 05:40:46.200 align:start position:0%
remainder and you break it into two
 
05:40:48.948 --> 05:40:48.958 align:start position:0%
parts and then you have some statutory
 
05:40:51.110 --> 05:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
limits above which everything goes in a
 
05:40:52.430 --> 05:40:52.440 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
05:40:55.070 --> 05:40:55.080 align:start position:0%
the intent of the language changes here
 
05:40:57.948 --> 05:40:57.958 align:start position:0%
is to simplify the process and to also
 
05:40:59.628 --> 05:40:59.638 align:start position:0%
eliminate some conflicts of interest
 
05:41:01.910 --> 05:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
there we want to remove the language
 
05:41:04.670 --> 05:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
that specifies that the first 100 000
 
05:41:06.230 --> 05:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
goes to the police psychological
 
05:41:08.570 --> 05:41:08.580 align:start position:0%
stability screening fund
 
05:41:10.910 --> 05:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
this is just not the right way to fund
 
05:41:12.830 --> 05:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
that for a couple of reasons first we
 
05:41:14.448 --> 05:41:14.458 align:start position:0%
don't know exactly how much is needed
 
05:41:16.010 --> 05:41:16.020 align:start position:0%
every year that's really something that
 
05:41:17.510 --> 05:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
the legislature should appropriate
 
05:41:19.310 --> 05:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
correctly in every year
 
05:41:24.590 --> 05:41:24.600 align:start position:0%
and also if police you know depends on
 
05:41:26.510 --> 05:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
those money that creates an incentive
 
05:41:28.310 --> 05:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
for them to engage in maybe more
 
05:41:30.110 --> 05:41:30.120 align:start position:0%
forfeiter than whether they are they
 
05:41:32.868 --> 05:41:32.878 align:start position:0%
otherwise would and while every law
 
05:41:35.930 --> 05:41:35.940 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer is trying to do the
 
05:41:37.730 --> 05:41:37.740 align:start position:0%
right thing every time it's just not
 
05:41:40.190 --> 05:41:40.200 align:start position:0%
good practice to give them incentives of
 
05:41:43.610 --> 05:41:43.620 align:start position:0%
that nature it also just simplifies the
 
05:41:45.770 --> 05:41:45.780 align:start position:0%
structure of our overall in the proposed
 
05:41:45.780 --> 05:41:46.730 align:start position:0%
structure of our overall in the proposed
language

05:41:46.730 --> 05:41:46.740 align:start position:0%
language
 
05:41:49.010 --> 05:41:49.020 align:start position:0%
there wouldn't be you know two separate
 
05:41:51.530 --> 05:41:51.540 align:start position:0%
you you wouldn't have that you just
 
05:41:53.330 --> 05:41:53.340 align:start position:0%
split that
 
05:41:56.570 --> 05:41:56.580 align:start position:0%
um entire amount in the way described
 
05:41:59.570 --> 05:41:59.580 align:start position:0%
there with 45 percent to the uh agency
 
05:42:03.530 --> 05:42:03.540 align:start position:0%
10 to a non-lab single count and 45 into
 
05:42:06.110 --> 05:42:06.120 align:start position:0%
the revolving drug for future fund the
 
05:42:08.448 --> 05:42:08.458 align:start position:0%
rest of the language is unchanged except
 
05:42:10.550 --> 05:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
for housekeeping changes with paragraph
 
05:42:12.708 --> 05:42:12.718 align:start position:0%
numbers and everything so it's a
 
05:42:14.330 --> 05:42:14.340 align:start position:0%
reasonably straightforward portion of
 
05:42:16.788 --> 05:42:16.798 align:start position:0%
the bill and uh you know obviously if
 
05:42:18.590 --> 05:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
you have any questions only try to be
 
05:42:23.330 --> 05:42:23.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:24.948 --> 05:42:24.958 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
05:42:30.350 --> 05:42:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:39.948 --> 05:42:39.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:42.288 --> 05:42:42.298 align:start position:0%
oh thank you madam chair and members of
 
05:42:44.270 --> 05:42:44.280 align:start position:0%
the committee uh for the record my name
 
05:42:45.770 --> 05:42:45.780 align:start position:0%
is Ross Connolly I'm the deputy state
 
05:42:47.810 --> 05:42:47.820 align:start position:0%
director for Americans for Prosperity in
 
05:42:48.708 --> 05:42:48.718 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
05:42:51.730 --> 05:42:51.740 align:start position:0%
here to voice our support for HB 593
 
05:42:54.650 --> 05:42:54.660 align:start position:0%
this bill should be familiar to the
 
05:42:56.208 --> 05:42:56.218 align:start position:0%
members the committee that have been
 
05:42:58.730 --> 05:42:58.740 align:start position:0%
around for a little while a very similar
 
05:43:00.470 --> 05:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
bill came before this committee last
 
05:43:02.990 --> 05:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
year and really one of the biggest
 
05:43:05.990 --> 05:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
issues was was really trying to make
 
05:43:08.330 --> 05:43:08.340 align:start position:0%
that shrinking down from the two-track
 
05:43:11.330 --> 05:43:11.340 align:start position:0%
uh process and forfeiture to the one
 
05:43:15.350 --> 05:43:15.360 align:start position:0%
track process uh it was a lot of the
 
05:43:16.970 --> 05:43:16.980 align:start position:0%
complication last year was really around
 
05:43:18.948 --> 05:43:18.958 align:start position:0%
how we adapt that into the New Hampshire
 
05:43:22.010 --> 05:43:22.020 align:start position:0%
court system and I know the the sponsor
 
05:43:24.590 --> 05:43:24.600 align:start position:0%
of the bill the co-sponsor and uh has
 
05:43:26.750 --> 05:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
worked with the Attorney General's
 
05:43:29.390 --> 05:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
office and the court system to really
 
05:43:31.070 --> 05:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
tighten up that language and make it
 
05:43:33.830 --> 05:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
work for for New Hampshire system
 
05:43:36.590 --> 05:43:36.600 align:start position:0%
um so just to briefly describe you know
 
05:43:39.530 --> 05:43:39.540 align:start position:0%
how this process currently Works uh if
 
05:43:41.510 --> 05:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
an individual is suspected of a crime
 
05:43:43.128 --> 05:43:43.138 align:start position:0%
they can have their property seized by
 
05:43:45.048 --> 05:43:45.058 align:start position:0%
law enforcement if they have probable
 
05:43:47.330 --> 05:43:47.340 align:start position:0%
probable cause to believe it was aided
 
05:43:49.610 --> 05:43:49.620 align:start position:0%
or gained by the defendant in the
 
05:43:52.548 --> 05:43:52.558 align:start position:0%
commission of a crime the the defendant
 
05:43:53.750 --> 05:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
then goes through the criminal court
 
05:43:56.090 --> 05:43:56.100 align:start position:0%
process if they are found not guilty
 
05:43:58.128 --> 05:43:58.138 align:start position:0%
they still need to go through a civil
 
05:44:01.128 --> 05:44:01.138 align:start position:0%
court process uh to for the case against
 
05:44:04.430 --> 05:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
their property that that was seized
 
05:44:06.230 --> 05:44:06.240 align:start position:0%
um this holds a different standard and
 
05:44:09.230 --> 05:44:09.240 align:start position:0%
Criminal Court uh the or then Criminal
 
05:44:11.510 --> 05:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
Court the the defendant is not able to
 
05:44:13.788 --> 05:44:13.798 align:start position:0%
have a lawyer provided to them and in
 
05:44:17.330 --> 05:44:17.340 align:start position:0%
most cases the property of uh that was
 
05:44:20.090 --> 05:44:20.100 align:start position:0%
taken is of such low value that it does
 
05:44:22.190 --> 05:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
not make Financial sense to go through a
 
05:44:23.868 --> 05:44:23.878 align:start position:0%
legal process to try and get it back
 
05:44:25.970 --> 05:44:25.980 align:start position:0%
which ends in what's called default
 
05:44:28.548 --> 05:44:28.558 align:start position:0%
which many many forfeitures end in
 
05:44:30.230 --> 05:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
default because it's just not worth
 
05:44:32.510 --> 05:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
going to get your property back even
 
05:44:34.850 --> 05:44:34.860 align:start position:0%
though you were found not guilty of the
 
05:44:37.368 --> 05:44:37.378 align:start position:0%
crime that you were accused of
 
05:44:37.378 --> 05:44:38.270 align:start position:0%
crime that you were accused of
um

05:44:38.270 --> 05:44:38.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:44:40.430 --> 05:44:40.440 align:start position:0%
this bill simply takes those two
 
05:44:42.890 --> 05:44:42.900 align:start position:0%
processes and and merges them in into
 
05:44:45.110 --> 05:44:45.120 align:start position:0%
one uh so the process would be
 
05:44:48.890 --> 05:44:48.900 align:start position:0%
streamlined uh for our court system uh
 
05:44:50.570 --> 05:44:50.580 align:start position:0%
it would provide that that
 
05:44:53.990 --> 05:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
representation uh for for the defendant
 
05:44:57.410 --> 05:44:57.420 align:start position:0%
uh through the court system uh the the
 
05:44:59.270 --> 05:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
judge would be familiar with the case
 
05:45:01.970 --> 05:45:01.980 align:start position:0%
the criminal case and be able to easily
 
05:45:03.948 --> 05:45:03.958 align:start position:0%
execute the the case against the
 
05:45:03.958 --> 05:45:05.390 align:start position:0%
execute the the case against the
property

05:45:05.390 --> 05:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
property
 
05:45:08.270 --> 05:45:08.280 align:start position:0%
um there's lots of Provisions in in the
 
05:45:10.970 --> 05:45:10.980 align:start position:0%
amendment to really uh give leeway to
 
05:45:12.850 --> 05:45:12.860 align:start position:0%
the courts of when those things happen
 
05:45:15.890 --> 05:45:15.900 align:start position:0%
uh so so that's really at the discretion
 
05:45:18.170 --> 05:45:18.180 align:start position:0%
of the Court uh and then the last part
 
05:45:21.048 --> 05:45:21.058 align:start position:0%
of this bill uh restricts the use of of
 
05:45:23.510 --> 05:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh the federal adoptions program through
 
05:45:25.490 --> 05:45:25.500 align:start position:0%
the Equitable sharing program of of
 
05:45:28.128 --> 05:45:28.138 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice uh this
 
05:45:32.590 --> 05:45:32.600 align:start position:0%
legislature uh back in 2016 I believe uh
 
05:45:34.850 --> 05:45:34.860 align:start position:0%
from the leadership of Representative
 
05:45:37.430 --> 05:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
McGuire decided to end the practice of
 
05:45:40.910 --> 05:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
civil forfeiture uh there are loopholes
 
05:45:43.250 --> 05:45:43.260 align:start position:0%
in that uh and one of them is is the
 
05:45:45.708 --> 05:45:45.718 align:start position:0%
federal adoptions program uh where you
 
05:45:48.048 --> 05:45:48.058 align:start position:0%
can go around the the law that this body
 
05:45:51.948 --> 05:45:51.958 align:start position:0%
agreed on uh and and get a forfeiture
 
05:45:55.670 --> 05:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
proceeding without uh a conviction uh so
 
05:45:58.490 --> 05:45:58.500 align:start position:0%
Joint Task forces are excluded from this
 
05:46:02.390 --> 05:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
uh just to give a pers perspective uh
 
05:46:04.190 --> 05:46:04.200 align:start position:0%
the Equitable sharing program through
 
05:46:07.430 --> 05:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
Federal adoptions is 19 of of
 
05:46:10.010 --> 05:46:10.020 align:start position:0%
forfeitures Joint Task forces account
 
05:46:12.410 --> 05:46:12.420 align:start position:0%
for 81 percent of forfeitures between
 
05:46:16.330 --> 05:46:16.340 align:start position:0%
2018 and 2020 uh and those are excluded
 
05:46:19.490 --> 05:46:19.500 align:start position:0%
uh so uh we believe the ends shouldn't
 
05:46:21.770 --> 05:46:21.780 align:start position:0%
justify the means uh gaining money
 
05:46:24.170 --> 05:46:24.180 align:start position:0%
through cases where an individual is
 
05:46:26.690 --> 05:46:26.700 align:start position:0%
found not guilty uh it cannot be
 
05:46:29.390 --> 05:46:29.400 align:start position:0%
justified uh and luckily this bill would
 
05:46:31.070 --> 05:46:31.080 align:start position:0%
only impact this portion of the bill
 
05:46:33.590 --> 05:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
would only impact around twelve thousand
 
05:46:35.570 --> 05:46:35.580 align:start position:0%
dollars uh over the course of three
 
05:46:35.580 --> 05:46:38.830 align:start position:0%
dollars uh over the course of three
years

05:46:38.830 --> 05:46:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:43.010 --> 05:46:43.020 align:start position:0%
behind me I'm happy to take questions
 
05:46:45.890 --> 05:46:45.900 align:start position:0%
representative Newman
 
05:46:47.628 --> 05:46:47.638 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman thanks for
 
05:46:49.430 --> 05:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh and I'm just
 
05:46:52.490 --> 05:46:52.500 align:start position:0%
curious about online on page two line 23
 
05:46:55.990 --> 05:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
and it has enumeration for cash and uh
 
05:46:59.208 --> 05:46:59.218 align:start position:0%
value for the vehicle I'm just wondering
 
05:47:01.190 --> 05:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
what that is there for and what they're
 
05:47:03.590 --> 05:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish
 
05:47:08.030 --> 05:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
we said page two two numeral three uh
 
05:47:10.730 --> 05:47:10.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:12.708 --> 05:47:12.718 align:start position:0%
right at the bottom of the page
 
05:47:15.350 --> 05:47:15.360 align:start position:0%
um I I I'm not to be honest I'm not sure
 
05:47:17.208 --> 05:47:17.218 align:start position:0%
so I'll defer to those those be
 
05:47:19.548 --> 05:47:19.558 align:start position:0%
following me uh that have more details
 
05:47:21.708 --> 05:47:21.718 align:start position:0%
on some of the the language changes the
 
05:47:21.718 --> 05:47:24.368 align:start position:0%
on some of the the language changes the
amendment

05:47:24.368 --> 05:47:24.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:29.090 --> 05:47:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:51.830 --> 05:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:53.390 --> 05:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
we will just remind everybody that we
 
05:47:54.708 --> 05:47:54.718 align:start position:0%

context first but answer your question
 
05:48:11.090 --> 05:48:11.100 align:start position:0%
so kind of thinking back about the
 
05:48:12.890 --> 05:48:12.900 align:start position:0%
origins of forfeiture it was sold to the
 
05:48:14.628 --> 05:48:14.638 align:start position:0%
public as a tool to get the oh gotten
 
05:48:16.548 --> 05:48:16.558 align:start position:0%
gains of drug kingpins you know back in
 
05:48:18.530 --> 05:48:18.540 align:start position:0%
the 80s 70s 80s think Pablo Escobar
 
05:48:20.208 --> 05:48:20.218 align:start position:0%
people who are beyond the jurisdictional
 
05:48:22.190 --> 05:48:22.200 align:start position:0%
reach of the US government and therefore
 
05:48:23.690 --> 05:48:23.700 align:start position:0%
because we couldn't get them as an
 
05:48:24.890 --> 05:48:24.900 align:start position:0%
individual we could go after their
 
05:48:24.900 --> 05:48:25.910 align:start position:0%
individual we could go after their
property

05:48:25.910 --> 05:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
property
 
05:48:28.430 --> 05:48:28.440 align:start position:0%
and so fast forward to today forfeiture
 
05:48:30.470 --> 05:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
is is much different and so forfeiture
 
05:48:32.510 --> 05:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
has really turned into a tool that often
 
05:48:35.090 --> 05:48:35.100 align:start position:0%
goes after people with little wealth and
 
05:48:37.010 --> 05:48:37.020 align:start position:0%
so because so often the amount of
 
05:48:39.110 --> 05:48:39.120 align:start position:0%
forfeiture is so little
 
05:48:40.910 --> 05:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
um it creates a perverse incentive so
 
05:48:42.110 --> 05:48:42.120 align:start position:0%
that people when you're talking about
 
05:48:43.788 --> 05:48:43.798 align:start position:0%
low dollar amounts like a thousand or
 
05:48:43.798 --> 05:48:44.750 align:start position:0%
low dollar amounts like a thousand or
below

05:48:44.750 --> 05:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
below
 
05:48:46.970 --> 05:48:46.980 align:start position:0%
for people with wealth who can hire an
 
05:48:48.470 --> 05:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
attorney will cost them more to hire an
 
05:48:50.390 --> 05:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
attorney to get their money back and and
 
05:48:51.890 --> 05:48:51.900 align:start position:0%
so they'll just do a default judgment
 
05:48:53.628 --> 05:48:53.638 align:start position:0%
and won't challenge it for people
 
05:48:55.310 --> 05:48:55.320 align:start position:0%
without wealth they can't hire a
 
05:48:56.930 --> 05:48:56.940 align:start position:0%
different attorney so they lose that
 
05:48:59.270 --> 05:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
money and so if the concept is really
 
05:49:00.830 --> 05:49:00.840 align:start position:0%
going after the ogotten gains of drug
 
05:49:03.288 --> 05:49:03.298 align:start position:0%
kingpins having this threshold of a
 
05:49:05.330 --> 05:49:05.340 align:start position:0%
thousand for cash and five thousand for
 
05:49:07.570 --> 05:49:07.580 align:start position:0%
a vehicle which mirrors the AG
 
05:49:10.250 --> 05:49:10.260 align:start position:0%
the way the AG is enforcing it right now
 
05:49:12.470 --> 05:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
is just a way to get back to the core
 
05:49:14.330 --> 05:49:14.340 align:start position:0%
concept of forbature which is to get the
 
05:49:17.570 --> 05:49:17.580 align:start position:0%
oh gotten gains thank you
 
05:49:19.788 --> 05:49:19.798 align:start position:0%
um and again you know why we also really
 
05:49:21.530 --> 05:49:21.540 align:start position:0%
love this bill is is because it's
 
05:49:23.868 --> 05:49:23.878 align:start position:0%
creating a more uniform process a more
 
05:49:25.610 --> 05:49:25.620 align:start position:0%
streamlined process through the criminal
 
05:49:27.890 --> 05:49:27.900 align:start position:0%
system which again ensures that everyone
 
05:49:29.868 --> 05:49:29.878 align:start position:0%
including internet people are able to
 
05:49:31.490 --> 05:49:31.500 align:start position:0%
get access to council and so if you
 
05:49:33.110 --> 05:49:33.120 align:start position:0%
qualify for a public defender for your
 
05:49:35.810 --> 05:49:35.820 align:start position:0%
criminal trial you're convicted they
 
05:49:37.788 --> 05:49:37.798 align:start position:0%
then execute a forfeiture proceeding
 
05:49:39.708 --> 05:49:39.718 align:start position:0%
your criminal defense attorney your
 
05:49:41.990 --> 05:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
public defender will stay with you and
 
05:49:43.368 --> 05:49:43.378 align:start position:0%
so people aren't forced to make this
 
05:49:44.990 --> 05:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
ridiculous decision between having to
 
05:49:46.730 --> 05:49:46.740 align:start position:0%
choose between their property and
 
05:49:48.170 --> 05:49:48.180 align:start position:0%
forfeiting their property or because
 
05:49:49.730 --> 05:49:49.740 align:start position:0%
they can't afford an attorney or
 
05:49:51.590 --> 05:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
challenge even if it's not a legitimate
 
05:49:53.030 --> 05:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
forfeiture and so we're just trying
 
05:49:54.830 --> 05:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
again to make sure that this is a fair
 
05:49:57.110 --> 05:49:57.120 align:start position:0%
system and again going after the
 
05:49:59.810 --> 05:49:59.820 align:start position:0%
ill-gotten gains of of uh illicit
 
05:50:01.610 --> 05:50:01.620 align:start position:0%
activity and not just people because
 
05:50:02.810 --> 05:50:02.820 align:start position:0%
they don't have wealth to defend
 
05:50:02.820 --> 05:50:04.970 align:start position:0%
they don't have wealth to defend
themselves

05:50:04.970 --> 05:50:04.980 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
05:50:04.980 --> 05:50:05.750 align:start position:0%
themselves
um

05:50:05.750 --> 05:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:50:08.390 --> 05:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
and I know my colleague Lee from IJ will
 
05:50:10.190 --> 05:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
get into the Weeds on this so and I know
 
05:50:11.208 --> 05:50:11.218 align:start position:0%
there's not a whole lot of time but
 
05:50:15.288 --> 05:50:15.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:17.030 --> 05:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
representative Muse
 
05:50:20.030 --> 05:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
yeah one question is
 
05:50:21.830 --> 05:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
um it sounded like
 
05:50:23.990 --> 05:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
um Mr Conley may have answered this
 
05:50:26.570 --> 05:50:26.580 align:start position:0%
before but um what percentage of
 
05:50:28.610 --> 05:50:28.620 align:start position:0%
forfeitures are we talking about in New
 
05:50:31.190 --> 05:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's my impression is it's a
 
05:50:33.650 --> 05:50:33.660 align:start position:0%
relatively a relatively small amount
 
05:50:35.570 --> 05:50:35.580 align:start position:0%
part of the overall amount
 
05:50:37.850 --> 05:50:37.860 align:start position:0%
yeah so I've worked on this issue in
 
05:50:39.230 --> 05:50:39.240 align:start position:0%
multiple States now
 
05:50:40.670 --> 05:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
um and New Hampshire it definitely is
 
05:50:42.350 --> 05:50:42.360 align:start position:0%
lower than most States in terms of the
 
05:50:43.610 --> 05:50:43.620 align:start position:0%
total amounts
 
05:50:46.430 --> 05:50:46.440 align:start position:0%
um and so I know my colleague Lee from
 
05:50:48.288 --> 05:50:48.298 align:start position:0%
IJ has I have the specific figures but I
 
05:50:49.670 --> 05:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
got them from him so I'll let him
 
05:50:52.730 --> 05:50:52.740 align:start position:0%
testify as to his figures
 
05:50:52.740 --> 05:50:55.128 align:start position:0%
testify as to his figures
thanks

05:50:55.128 --> 05:50:55.138 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
05:50:56.448 --> 05:50:56.458 align:start position:0%
so you know further questions thank you
 
05:51:01.430 --> 05:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:08.090 --> 05:51:08.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:08.100 --> 05:51:15.948 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:51:15.948 --> 05:51:15.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:17.510 --> 05:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Madam chair members of
 
05:51:18.890 --> 05:51:18.900 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Miles Madison
 
05:51:20.628 --> 05:51:20.638 align:start position:0%
I'm the chief of the criminal Bureau at
 
05:51:22.730 --> 05:51:22.740 align:start position:0%
the Department of Justice
 
05:51:22.740 --> 05:51:23.570 align:start position:0%
the Department of Justice
um

05:51:23.570 --> 05:51:23.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:51:25.070 --> 05:51:25.080 align:start position:0%
we appreciate the engagement with
 
05:51:27.048 --> 05:51:27.058 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire and the
 
05:51:29.690 --> 05:51:29.700 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors of this bill for our input
 
05:51:31.250 --> 05:51:31.260 align:start position:0%
on some of the content or technical
 
05:51:34.190 --> 05:51:34.200 align:start position:0%
questions relating to criminal
 
05:51:37.010 --> 05:51:37.020 align:start position:0%
forfeiture that the Attorney General's
 
05:51:41.208 --> 05:51:41.218 align:start position:0%
office takes no position on this bill or
 
05:51:43.010 --> 05:51:43.020 align:start position:0%
the utilization of in-rem civil
 
05:51:44.690 --> 05:51:44.700 align:start position:0%
forfeiture versus criminal forfeiture
 
05:51:48.368 --> 05:51:48.378 align:start position:0%
would just testify in a few of the
 
05:51:50.750 --> 05:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
content or issues raised for
 
05:51:53.510 --> 05:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
consideration by this committee today
 
05:51:56.690 --> 05:51:56.700 align:start position:0%
so to make clear there was reference uh
 
05:51:58.850 --> 05:51:58.860 align:start position:0%
in a previous testimony relating to the
 
05:52:01.128 --> 05:52:01.138 align:start position:0%
attorney general's policies relating to
 
05:52:02.810 --> 05:52:02.820 align:start position:0%
civil forfeiture in the current regime
 
05:52:05.628 --> 05:52:05.638 align:start position:0%
as it exists civil forfeiture is not
 
05:52:07.190 --> 05:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
pursued if there is an underlying
 
05:52:10.070 --> 05:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
acquittal on the criminal charge uh and
 
05:52:14.030 --> 05:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
then there are also our uh limits on the
 
05:52:18.310 --> 05:52:18.320 align:start position:0%
the amount of forfeiture or a threshold
 
05:52:20.510 --> 05:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
by which the Attorney General's office
 
05:52:23.030 --> 05:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
would pursue forfeiture the Attorney
 
05:52:25.010 --> 05:52:25.020 align:start position:0%
General's guidelines relating to
 
05:52:27.048 --> 05:52:27.058 align:start position:0%
forfeiture are a public document that
 
05:52:30.288 --> 05:52:30.298 align:start position:0%
are on the Attorney General's website
 
05:52:32.930 --> 05:52:32.940 align:start position:0%
I would note that there are reciprocal
 
05:52:35.690 --> 05:52:35.700 align:start position:0%
costs just in in managing the judicial
 
05:52:37.910 --> 05:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
proceedings relating to forfeiture so
 
05:52:40.070 --> 05:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
the description of now there being a
 
05:52:41.510 --> 05:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
criminal process and then a separate
 
05:52:44.330 --> 05:52:44.340 align:start position:0%
civil process that is true that's still
 
05:52:46.510 --> 05:52:46.520 align:start position:0%
a Judicial proceeding that would require
 
05:52:49.490 --> 05:52:49.500 align:start position:0%
resources so just for consideration by
 
05:52:51.470 --> 05:52:51.480 align:start position:0%
the committee even if it's the same
 
05:52:53.330 --> 05:52:53.340 align:start position:0%
public defender who's handling the
 
05:52:55.490 --> 05:52:55.500 align:start position:0%
underlying criminal offense and then a
 
05:52:57.430 --> 05:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
corresponding criminal forfeiture
 
05:53:00.590 --> 05:53:00.600 align:start position:0%
there's still a resource Demand on any
 
05:53:00.600 --> 05:53:01.868 align:start position:0%
there's still a resource Demand on any
defense

05:53:01.868 --> 05:53:01.878 align:start position:0%
defense
 
05:53:04.548 --> 05:53:04.558 align:start position:0%
representative or attorney for managing
 
05:53:07.670 --> 05:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
that process it's not it's not without a
 
05:53:07.680 --> 05:53:09.530 align:start position:0%
that process it's not it's not without a
cost

05:53:09.530 --> 05:53:09.540 align:start position:0%
cost
 
05:53:11.330 --> 05:53:11.340 align:start position:0%
um would note two areas for
 
05:53:13.490 --> 05:53:13.500 align:start position:0%
consideration by the the committee as
 
05:53:16.250 --> 05:53:16.260 align:start position:0%
well one would be the review process or
 
05:53:20.090 --> 05:53:20.100 align:start position:0%
in the language of the amendment uh who
 
05:53:22.610 --> 05:53:22.620 align:start position:0%
is initiating or conducting the
 
05:53:25.190 --> 05:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
forfeiture proceedings the prior
 
05:53:26.810 --> 05:53:26.820 align:start position:0%
testimony including the description by
 
05:53:28.610 --> 05:53:28.620 align:start position:0%
representative mcquire McGuire was
 
05:53:31.610 --> 05:53:31.620 align:start position:0%
describing a streamlining of the process
 
05:53:34.010 --> 05:53:34.020 align:start position:0%
by trying to ensure that the same
 
05:53:35.750 --> 05:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
Prosecuting Authority the same
 
05:53:38.330 --> 05:53:38.340 align:start position:0%
prosecutor is handling both the criminal
 
05:53:42.010 --> 05:53:42.020 align:start position:0%
case and then the criminal forfeiture
 
05:53:46.010 --> 05:53:46.020 align:start position:0%
the language is as drafted appears to
 
05:53:48.190 --> 05:53:48.200 align:start position:0%
consider the Attorney General's office
 
05:53:50.810 --> 05:53:50.820 align:start position:0%
and still intensely involve the Attorney
 
05:53:54.110 --> 05:53:54.120 align:start position:0%
General's office in that process I don't
 
05:53:57.830 --> 05:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
have suggested language relating to that
 
05:53:59.990 --> 05:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
but would put it to the committee for
 
05:54:01.910 --> 05:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
consideration of
 
05:54:03.890 --> 05:54:03.900 align:start position:0%
um if there is a streamlining of the
 
05:54:05.448 --> 05:54:05.458 align:start position:0%
process having the Attorney General's
 
05:54:07.730 --> 05:54:07.740 align:start position:0%
office still involved would still be
 
05:54:09.830 --> 05:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
keeping the same number of of parties
 
05:54:13.368 --> 05:54:13.378 align:start position:0%
involved in a forfeiture proceeding it
 
05:54:17.448 --> 05:54:17.458 align:start position:0%
may still be brought by the uh the the
 
05:54:20.150 --> 05:54:20.160 align:start position:0%
prosecuting Authority so potentially
 
05:54:22.610 --> 05:54:22.620 align:start position:0%
County attorney but if the Attorney
 
05:54:24.470 --> 05:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
General's office is still involved in
 
05:54:26.030 --> 05:54:26.040 align:start position:0%
that proceeding then there are still
 
05:54:28.910 --> 05:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
because it's not perhaps streamlining it
 
05:54:31.250 --> 05:54:31.260 align:start position:0%
to the same degree that may be the goal
 
05:54:33.470 --> 05:54:33.480 align:start position:0%
in this legislation
 
05:54:36.048 --> 05:54:36.058 align:start position:0%
um I would also note just some practical
 
05:54:38.570 --> 05:54:38.580 align:start position:0%
considerations based on the operations
 
05:54:41.170 --> 05:54:41.180 align:start position:0%
of the the current forfeiture law
 
05:54:44.090 --> 05:54:44.100 align:start position:0%
on page
 
05:54:48.590 --> 05:54:48.600 align:start position:0%
for line 19 relating to time
 
05:54:48.600 --> 05:54:49.570 align:start position:0%
for line 19 relating to time
um

05:54:49.570 --> 05:54:49.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:54:54.590 --> 05:54:54.600 align:start position:0%
this legislation currently envisions
 
05:54:57.470 --> 05:54:57.480 align:start position:0%
only a limited possibility for extending
 
05:54:59.750 --> 05:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh the time that's talking about a party
 
05:55:01.310 --> 05:55:01.320 align:start position:0%
by agreement or for good cause may move
 
05:55:02.990 --> 05:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
for one extension of no more than 30
 
05:55:05.390 --> 05:55:05.400 align:start position:0%
days would suggest just making that at
 
05:55:07.850 --> 05:55:07.860 align:start position:0%
the depression of the court or a party
 
05:55:10.250 --> 05:55:10.260 align:start position:0%
may move for extension to allow this
 
05:55:13.490 --> 05:55:13.500 align:start position:0%
process to play out consistent with the
 
05:55:16.190 --> 05:55:16.200 align:start position:0%
underlying facts the the demands of that
 
05:55:17.868 --> 05:55:17.878 align:start position:0%
particular proceeding rather than having
 
05:55:21.048 --> 05:55:21.058 align:start position:0%
a strict timeline on that with that I'm
 
05:55:22.490 --> 05:55:22.500 align:start position:0%
willing to take any questions from the
 
05:55:22.500 --> 05:55:24.470 align:start position:0%
willing to take any questions from the
committee

05:55:24.470 --> 05:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:55:26.510 --> 05:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
representative Jennifer
 
05:55:28.610 --> 05:55:28.620 align:start position:0%
thank you to the chair and thank you for
 
05:55:31.490 --> 05:55:31.500 align:start position:0%
taking my question my recollection from
 
05:55:33.230 --> 05:55:33.240 align:start position:0%
discussions I had when I was on
 
05:55:36.048 --> 05:55:36.058 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee debating this very
 
05:55:40.070 --> 05:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh subject matter my recollection is
 
05:55:44.448 --> 05:55:44.458 align:start position:0%
that at one time there was a criminal uh
 
05:55:48.110 --> 05:55:48.120 align:start position:0%
process and it was a civil process so
 
05:55:51.048 --> 05:55:51.058 align:start position:0%
effectively a police department
 
05:55:54.110 --> 05:55:54.120 align:start position:0%
would go and make a seizure make an
 
05:55:57.110 --> 05:55:57.120 align:start position:0%
arrest and prosecution would not
 
05:56:00.770 --> 05:56:00.780 align:start position:0%
prosecute no process and then they would
 
05:56:03.948 --> 05:56:03.958 align:start position:0%
pursue a civil forfeiture through the
 
05:56:06.288 --> 05:56:06.298 align:start position:0%
federal court system is that still an
 
05:56:08.270 --> 05:56:08.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity for that our Police
 
05:56:13.730 --> 05:56:13.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:16.910 --> 05:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
uh you I I don't believe so I think that
 
05:56:19.430 --> 05:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
this is contemplating current policy uh
 
05:56:21.770 --> 05:56:21.780 align:start position:0%
where the uh guidelines and process
 
05:56:25.610 --> 05:56:25.620 align:start position:0%
would not pursue a civil forfeiture if
 
05:56:27.110 --> 05:56:27.120 align:start position:0%
there is an an acquittal on the
 
05:56:31.070 --> 05:56:31.080 align:start position:0%
underlying criminal charges this is this
 
05:56:33.830 --> 05:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
bill would transition from a civil
 
05:56:35.990 --> 05:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
forfeiture of a civil and criminal
 
05:56:38.948 --> 05:56:38.958 align:start position:0%
proceeding to a criminal forfeiture
 
05:56:42.470 --> 05:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
process to to try to combine those legal
 
05:56:45.470 --> 05:56:45.480 align:start position:0%
proceedings and it would uh it's my
 
05:56:46.730 --> 05:56:46.740 align:start position:0%
understanding would have the same
 
05:56:50.030 --> 05:56:50.040 align:start position:0%
effective current policy of requiring a
 
05:56:51.770 --> 05:56:51.780 align:start position:0%
conviction on the underlying felony
 
05:56:54.048 --> 05:56:54.058 align:start position:0%
offense before any forfeiture would be
 
05:56:54.058 --> 05:56:58.310 align:start position:0%
offense before any forfeiture would be
authorized

05:56:58.310 --> 05:56:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:01.670 --> 05:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
um my recollection is the the current
 
05:57:04.010 --> 05:57:04.020 align:start position:0%
policy of waiting for a conviction in
 
05:57:06.890 --> 05:57:06.900 align:start position:0%
order to pursue that was in place when
 
05:57:09.470 --> 05:57:09.480 align:start position:0%
we had that discussion on that committee
 
05:57:12.770 --> 05:57:12.780 align:start position:0%
and again it wasn't the prose prosecutor
 
05:57:14.690 --> 05:57:14.700 align:start position:0%
uh County attorney or the Attorney
 
05:57:17.390 --> 05:57:17.400 align:start position:0%
General's office was pursuing the Civil
 
05:57:18.948 --> 05:57:18.958 align:start position:0%
forfeiture it was actually the police
 
05:57:20.448 --> 05:57:20.458 align:start position:0%
department that was doing that through
 
05:57:23.510 --> 05:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
the federal process and I I believe my
 
05:57:24.830 --> 05:57:24.840 align:start position:0%
question is
 
05:57:27.048 --> 05:57:27.058 align:start position:0%
if this bill were to pass would that
 
05:57:29.810 --> 05:57:29.820 align:start position:0%
would that process of civil forfeiture
 
05:57:31.490 --> 05:57:31.500 align:start position:0%
under the federal system still be
 
05:57:33.948 --> 05:57:33.958 align:start position:0%
available to that Police Department
 
05:57:36.170 --> 05:57:36.180 align:start position:0%
uh represent I believe that there was a
 
05:57:38.930 --> 05:57:38.940 align:start position:0%
some discussion uh earlier in earlier
 
05:57:40.670 --> 05:57:40.680 align:start position:0%
testimony relating to that it would be
 
05:57:43.190 --> 05:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
toward the end of the legislation
 
05:57:44.570 --> 05:57:44.580 align:start position:0%
um or the amendment I believe the
 
05:57:46.788 --> 05:57:46.798 align:start position:0%
language would be on page 10 relating to
 
05:57:46.798 --> 05:57:47.890 align:start position:0%
language would be on page 10 relating to
guidelines

05:57:47.890 --> 05:57:47.900 align:start position:0%
guidelines
 
05:57:50.390 --> 05:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
05:57:53.270 --> 05:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
the utilization of forfeiture as it
 
05:57:55.250 --> 05:57:55.260 align:start position:0%
relates to State versus Federal
 
05:57:57.048 --> 05:57:57.058 align:start position:0%
forfeiture so
 
05:57:59.270 --> 05:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
um I wouldn't speak specifically on the
 
05:58:01.850 --> 05:58:01.860 align:start position:0%
operation of of that language there but
 
05:58:03.410 --> 05:58:03.420 align:start position:0%
I believe that this language in the
 
05:58:04.670 --> 05:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
prior testimony was that it would be
 
05:58:06.770 --> 05:58:06.780 align:start position:0%
limiting the ability to essentially go
 
05:58:09.170 --> 05:58:09.180 align:start position:0%
around State forfeiture proceedings uh
 
05:58:13.010 --> 05:58:13.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:13.020 --> 05:58:18.288 align:start position:0%
 
anymore

05:58:18.288 --> 05:58:18.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:24.890 --> 05:58:24.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:24.900 --> 05:58:31.190 align:start position:0%
 
Richard

05:58:31.190 --> 05:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:32.868 --> 05:58:32.878 align:start position:0%
I'm not exactly sure what this last name
 
05:58:32.878 --> 05:58:34.070 align:start position:0%
I'm not exactly sure what this last name
is

05:58:34.070 --> 05:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:58:37.250 --> 05:58:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:39.288 --> 05:58:39.298 align:start position:0%
my name is Richard Sam perrel I'm the
 
05:58:41.030 --> 05:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
acting executive director at the New
 
05:58:43.250 --> 05:58:43.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire judicial Council
 
05:58:43.260 --> 05:58:47.090 align:start position:0%
Hampshire judicial Council
um

05:58:47.090 --> 05:58:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:47.100 --> 05:58:49.010 align:start position:0%
 
sure

05:58:49.010 --> 05:58:49.020 align:start position:0%
sure
 
05:58:51.650 --> 05:58:51.660 align:start position:0%
uh the judicial Council oversees the
 
05:58:53.930 --> 05:58:53.940 align:start position:0%
delivery of indigent defense services in
 
05:58:57.470 --> 05:58:57.480 align:start position:0%
criminal cases I only wanted to testify
 
05:58:59.208 --> 05:58:59.218 align:start position:0%
to clarify the fiscal note that was
 
05:59:01.368 --> 05:59:01.378 align:start position:0%
provided on this bill we take no
 
05:59:04.788 --> 05:59:04.798 align:start position:0%
position on the bill itself but this
 
05:59:07.368 --> 05:59:07.378 align:start position:0%
would be a new area of legal services
 
05:59:10.128 --> 05:59:10.138 align:start position:0%
that are provided by defense lawyers in
 
05:59:13.190 --> 05:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
criminal cases that would just
 
05:59:14.750 --> 05:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean that there would have
 
05:59:18.170 --> 05:59:18.180 align:start position:0%
to be some training and consideration
 
05:59:20.448 --> 05:59:20.458 align:start position:0%
given to the resources that currently
 
05:59:22.910 --> 05:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
exist to be able to provide those
 
05:59:22.920 --> 05:59:23.948 align:start position:0%
exist to be able to provide those
Services

05:59:23.948 --> 05:59:23.958 align:start position:0%
Services
 
05:59:26.390 --> 05:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
the other concern expressed in the
 
05:59:29.090 --> 05:59:29.100 align:start position:0%
fiscal node is the length of time to
 
05:59:32.330 --> 05:59:32.340 align:start position:0%
close a case this may affect that length
 
05:59:36.590 --> 05:59:36.600 align:start position:0%
but that's really uncertain from the
 
05:59:38.868 --> 05:59:38.878 align:start position:0%
process that's being proposed but other
 
05:59:40.850 --> 05:59:40.860 align:start position:0%
than that I have no other comment I'm
 
05:59:42.590 --> 05:59:42.600 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions if you have
 
05:59:42.600 --> 05:59:45.830 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions if you have
them

05:59:45.830 --> 05:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:48.230 --> 05:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
representative Muse
 
05:59:50.990 --> 05:59:51.000 align:start position:0%
the effective date is January 1st 2024
 
05:59:53.890 --> 05:59:53.900 align:start position:0%
would that be enough time
 
05:59:57.410 --> 05:59:57.420 align:start position:0%
to conduct the kind of proper training
 
05:59:59.150 --> 05:59:59.160 align:start position:0%
you think would be required
 
06:00:01.730 --> 06:00:01.740 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that that would be a
 
06:00:03.170 --> 06:00:03.180 align:start position:0%
sufficient time to at least have some
 
06:00:05.090 --> 06:00:05.100 align:start position:0%
training provided to lawyers who are
 
06:00:10.430 --> 06:00:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:14.150 --> 06:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
all right thank you for your testimony
 
06:00:27.910 --> 06:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:30.590 --> 06:00:30.600 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam sure my name is Bob
 
06:00:32.270 --> 06:00:32.280 align:start position:0%
Lynn I'm a state representative from
 
06:00:35.090 --> 06:00:35.100 align:start position:0%
Windham and as representative McGuire I
 
06:00:37.190 --> 06:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
mentioned I'm a co-sponsor on the bill
 
06:00:40.970 --> 06:00:40.980 align:start position:0%
and I did work with uh representative
 
06:00:43.368 --> 06:00:43.378 align:start position:0%
McGuire at Mr McGrath who you will hear
 
06:00:48.048 --> 06:00:48.058 align:start position:0%
from uh shortly uh Mr head from the
 
06:00:50.510 --> 06:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
judicial branch
 
06:00:53.390 --> 06:00:53.400 align:start position:0%
and I I think this amendment
 
06:00:56.810 --> 06:00:56.820 align:start position:0%
is is a good work product
 
06:00:59.270 --> 06:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
um and I'm and I'm very much in favor of
 
06:01:01.190 --> 06:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
it I think that you've heard some of the
 
06:01:02.930 --> 06:01:02.940 align:start position:0%
abuses that have
 
06:01:06.410 --> 06:01:06.420 align:start position:0%
sort of happened in the past with uh the
 
06:01:08.948 --> 06:01:08.958 align:start position:0%
forfeiture uh regime
 
06:01:12.288 --> 06:01:12.298 align:start position:0%
and I think that that this is designed
 
06:01:15.288 --> 06:01:15.298 align:start position:0%
to correct it I I know I and I know my
 
06:01:16.670 --> 06:01:16.680 align:start position:0%
time is short you've got a lot of other
 
06:01:18.350 --> 06:01:18.360 align:start position:0%
people to hear from and I guess the one
 
06:01:20.690 --> 06:01:20.700 align:start position:0%
thing I wanted I just want to say is
 
06:01:24.048 --> 06:01:24.058 align:start position:0%
I know Mr head is concerned and will I
 
06:01:25.490 --> 06:01:25.500 align:start position:0%
think we'll tell you
 
06:01:28.128 --> 06:01:28.138 align:start position:0%
that the judicial branch is is somewhat
 
06:01:31.010 --> 06:01:31.020 align:start position:0%
concerned about
 
06:01:31.020 --> 06:01:32.208 align:start position:0%
concerned about
um

06:01:32.208 --> 06:01:32.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:01:35.030 --> 06:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
sort of some of the of the like how are
 
06:01:38.690 --> 06:01:38.700 align:start position:0%
some of the processes if you will of
 
06:01:38.700 --> 06:01:39.970 align:start position:0%
some of the processes if you will of
making

06:01:39.970 --> 06:01:39.980 align:start position:0%
making
 
06:01:43.010 --> 06:01:43.020 align:start position:0%
forfeiture part of the criminal case and
 
06:01:45.770 --> 06:01:45.780 align:start position:0%
I I'm you know I'm sympathetic to that
 
06:01:49.670 --> 06:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
but I I also think that if you read
 
06:01:51.890 --> 06:01:51.900 align:start position:0%
through the amendment it it is it is
 
06:01:53.690 --> 06:01:53.700 align:start position:0%
really fashioned
 
06:01:58.010 --> 06:01:58.020 align:start position:0%
to give a great deal of discretion to
 
06:02:03.410 --> 06:02:03.420 align:start position:0%
the court as to how it as to how it um
 
06:02:05.810 --> 06:02:05.820 align:start position:0%
sort of implements this in other words
 
06:02:07.610 --> 06:02:07.620 align:start position:0%
it's you know there's in many places as
 
06:02:09.708 --> 06:02:09.718 align:start position:0%
you'll see it says the court can you
 
06:02:11.390 --> 06:02:11.400 align:start position:0%
know can do something in this way or
 
06:02:14.030 --> 06:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
that way or this or the other way or at
 
06:02:16.150 --> 06:02:16.160 align:start position:0%
its discretion and I think the the the
 
06:02:19.368 --> 06:02:19.378 align:start position:0%
uh the intent is to give the court
 
06:02:22.788 --> 06:02:22.798 align:start position:0%
a great deal of discretion in how it
 
06:02:24.830 --> 06:02:24.840 align:start position:0%
implements this
 
06:02:27.470 --> 06:02:27.480 align:start position:0%
um and I and so I you know I believe
 
06:02:30.170 --> 06:02:30.180 align:start position:0%
that that will I'm not saying that there
 
06:02:31.910 --> 06:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
won't be some bumps in the road there
 
06:02:34.850 --> 06:02:34.860 align:start position:0%
always is with a with a new uh process
 
06:02:37.548 --> 06:02:37.558 align:start position:0%
but I do think that this is a process
 
06:02:39.530 --> 06:02:39.540 align:start position:0%
that can work
 
06:02:42.530 --> 06:02:42.540 align:start position:0%
um uh because the court is the courts
 
06:02:46.190 --> 06:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
are given so much discretion to uh uh to
 
06:02:47.868 --> 06:02:47.878 align:start position:0%
handle I mean let me just give you one
 
06:02:49.788 --> 06:02:49.798 align:start position:0%
example I know I know one of the things
 
06:02:51.288 --> 06:02:51.298 align:start position:0%
that he and I talked about in the hall
 
06:02:53.390 --> 06:02:53.400 align:start position:0%
outside was was
 
06:02:56.590 --> 06:02:56.600 align:start position:0%
um the issue of you know what happens
 
06:03:00.350 --> 06:03:00.360 align:start position:0%
bear in mind as that that
 
06:03:03.170 --> 06:03:03.180 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a seizure that occurs
 
06:03:06.170 --> 06:03:06.180 align:start position:0%
first when the property's actually taken
 
06:03:07.670 --> 06:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
let's say a car when the property's
 
06:03:10.310 --> 06:03:10.320 align:start position:0%
actually taken and then there will be
 
06:03:13.368 --> 06:03:13.378 align:start position:0%
some time before the state decides
 
06:03:14.690 --> 06:03:14.700 align:start position:0%
whether they are going to move forward
 
06:03:16.970 --> 06:03:16.980 align:start position:0%
and actually try to Forfeit it so you
 
06:03:19.250 --> 06:03:19.260 align:start position:0%
gotta distinguish seizure from
 
06:03:19.260 --> 06:03:20.690 align:start position:0%
gotta distinguish seizure from
forfeiture

06:03:20.690 --> 06:03:20.700 align:start position:0%
forfeiture
 
06:03:22.070 --> 06:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
um the seizure is when the property's
 
06:03:23.810 --> 06:03:23.820 align:start position:0%
actually taken and now it's being held
 
06:03:26.090 --> 06:03:26.100 align:start position:0%
it may end up just being turned back to
 
06:03:28.850 --> 06:03:28.860 align:start position:0%
the to the to the property owner but at
 
06:03:30.770 --> 06:03:30.780 align:start position:0%
some point the state will decide we're
 
06:03:32.570 --> 06:03:32.580 align:start position:0%
going to either move to Forfeit this or
 
06:03:34.310 --> 06:03:34.320 align:start position:0%
not and for example one of the things
 
06:03:36.770 --> 06:03:36.780 align:start position:0%
that attorney Ed raised with very valid
 
06:03:42.110 --> 06:03:42.120 align:start position:0%
point is what if the um someone uh who
 
06:03:44.390 --> 06:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
isn't who is who claims to be innocent
 
06:03:46.430 --> 06:03:46.440 align:start position:0%
or is an innocent owner as an example a
 
06:03:49.128 --> 06:03:49.138 align:start position:0%
lien holder what if they
 
06:03:52.910 --> 06:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
um uh want to get the property back
 
06:03:56.150 --> 06:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
after it's seized but before it's been
 
06:03:58.368 --> 06:03:58.378 align:start position:0%
forfeited and for example that could
 
06:04:01.788 --> 06:04:01.798 align:start position:0%
happen when the case is still before the
 
06:04:04.128 --> 06:04:04.138 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court uh and his question will
 
06:04:05.750 --> 06:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
have very legitimate question so what is
 
06:04:08.030 --> 06:04:08.040 align:start position:0%
the you know this this bill contemplates
 
06:04:09.708 --> 06:04:09.718 align:start position:0%
that these proceedings will happen in
 
06:04:11.690 --> 06:04:11.700 align:start position:0%
the superior court so what do you do in
 
06:04:13.910 --> 06:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
that kind of situation
 
06:04:16.430 --> 06:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
um and very valid concerned you know I
 
06:04:18.350 --> 06:04:18.360 align:start position:0%
can understand it completely so just as
 
06:04:21.470 --> 06:04:21.480 align:start position:0%
a suggestion if you look at page four of
 
06:04:23.590 --> 06:04:23.600 align:start position:0%
the amendment online
 
06:04:27.590 --> 06:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh nine this uh it's paragraph three
 
06:04:32.390 --> 06:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
dash a parenthesis a one three what you
 
06:04:34.430 --> 06:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
could do there may be better ways of
 
06:04:36.288 --> 06:04:36.298 align:start position:0%
doing it but I'm just off the uh you
 
06:04:38.570 --> 06:04:38.580 align:start position:0%
know off the cuff as I thought about
 
06:04:41.090 --> 06:04:41.100 align:start position:0%
what he raised you could add another
 
06:04:44.208 --> 06:04:44.218 align:start position:0%
sentence at the end of line 10 that
 
06:04:45.350 --> 06:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
would say
 
06:04:46.850 --> 06:04:46.860 align:start position:0%
if such
 
06:04:46.860 --> 06:04:47.390 align:start position:0%
if such
um

06:04:47.390 --> 06:04:47.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:04:50.930 --> 06:04:50.940 align:start position:0%
if such emotion is filed
 
06:04:50.940 --> 06:04:51.590 align:start position:0%
if such emotion is filed
um

06:04:51.590 --> 06:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:04:51.600 --> 06:04:53.628 align:start position:0%
um
uh

06:04:53.628 --> 06:04:53.638 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:04:57.708 --> 06:04:57.718 align:start position:0%
uh with uh if such emotion is filed the
 
06:05:01.190 --> 06:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
case if then pending uh in Circuit Court
 
06:05:03.650 --> 06:05:03.660 align:start position:0%
shall be transferred to the superior
 
06:05:06.650 --> 06:05:06.660 align:start position:0%
court for all purposes I mean that uh
 
06:05:08.510 --> 06:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
you know I think that even without that
 
06:05:10.250 --> 06:05:10.260 align:start position:0%
the superior the given the other
 
06:05:12.770 --> 06:05:12.780 align:start position:0%
language in the bill the circuit the the
 
06:05:15.830 --> 06:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
judicial branch could do that on its own
 
06:05:18.948 --> 06:05:18.958 align:start position:0%
but if you wanted to sort of uh
 
06:05:21.410 --> 06:05:21.420 align:start position:0%
you know put more language in there to
 
06:05:23.090 --> 06:05:23.100 align:start position:0%
be directive to of how the judicial
 
06:05:24.530 --> 06:05:24.540 align:start position:0%
branch should handle it you could do
 
06:05:24.540 --> 06:05:25.670 align:start position:0%
branch should handle it you could do
that

06:05:25.670 --> 06:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:05:27.590 --> 06:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
um so I you know that I think I guess
 
06:05:30.288 --> 06:05:30.298 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying is
 
06:05:33.110 --> 06:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
this is a new procedure it would you
 
06:05:34.490 --> 06:05:34.500 align:start position:0%
know there will be some bumps in the
 
06:05:37.250 --> 06:05:37.260 align:start position:0%
road I understand the courts the Court's
 
06:05:39.110 --> 06:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
sort of concerned but I don't think you
 
06:05:42.650 --> 06:05:42.660 align:start position:0%
uh for you know how do we what are all
 
06:05:44.030 --> 06:05:44.040 align:start position:0%
the steps we have to go through to
 
06:05:47.030 --> 06:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
implement this I fully appreciate that
 
06:05:49.128 --> 06:05:49.138 align:start position:0%
but I I don't think that that should be
 
06:05:51.110 --> 06:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
a reason for not going forward with this
 
06:05:53.150 --> 06:05:53.160 align:start position:0%
because it really does serve very
 
06:05:55.548 --> 06:05:55.558 align:start position:0%
important uh purposes and so I hope that
 
06:05:57.048 --> 06:05:57.058 align:start position:0%
that's the conclusion you'll come to
 
06:05:57.058 --> 06:05:58.010 align:start position:0%
that's the conclusion you'll come to
also

06:05:58.010 --> 06:05:58.020 align:start position:0%
also
 
06:05:59.570 --> 06:05:59.580 align:start position:0%
thank you representative are there any
 
06:05:59.580 --> 06:06:01.310 align:start position:0%
thank you representative are there any
questions

06:06:01.310 --> 06:06:01.320 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:06:06.048 --> 06:06:06.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:16.368 --> 06:06:16.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:18.288 --> 06:06:18.298 align:start position:0%
uh Madam chair members of the committee
 
06:06:20.990 --> 06:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
my name is Lee McGrath I'm an attorney
 
06:06:23.570 --> 06:06:23.580 align:start position:0%
at The Institute uh for for justice and
 
06:06:25.430 --> 06:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
I've had the honor of testifying here in
 
06:06:27.170 --> 06:06:27.180 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for a number of years and
 
06:06:30.650 --> 06:06:30.660 align:start position:0%
building upon past past efforts I'm I'm
 
06:06:33.230 --> 06:06:33.240 align:start position:0%
hopeful hopeful that three is a is the
 
06:06:36.590 --> 06:06:36.600 align:start position:0%
lucky charm uh uh here
 
06:06:38.810 --> 06:06:38.820 align:start position:0%
crime should not pay
 
06:06:41.090 --> 06:06:41.100 align:start position:0%
it is legitimate for the State of New
 
06:06:43.970 --> 06:06:43.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to confiscate the fruit and
 
06:06:47.628 --> 06:06:47.638 align:start position:0%
the instruments of crime nothing in this
 
06:06:50.930 --> 06:06:50.940 align:start position:0%
bill changes those core principles
 
06:06:54.110 --> 06:06:54.120 align:start position:0%
this bill into a large extent is a real
 
06:06:56.390 --> 06:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
estate bill
 
06:07:00.288 --> 06:07:00.298 align:start position:0%
it puts this question of transferring
 
06:07:03.948 --> 06:07:03.958 align:start position:0%
title into a different place
 
06:07:08.330 --> 06:07:08.340 align:start position:0%
today that litigation is done in Civil
 
06:07:13.250 --> 06:07:13.260 align:start position:0%
Court should you enact this bill it will
 
06:07:16.250 --> 06:07:16.260 align:start position:0%
move to Criminal Court
 
06:07:19.070 --> 06:07:19.080 align:start position:0%
this bill is based on many of the
 
06:07:21.948 --> 06:07:21.958 align:start position:0%
processes that the attorney general has
 
06:07:25.628 --> 06:07:25.638 align:start position:0%
promulgated in a 2007 doc document
 
06:07:29.448 --> 06:07:29.458 align:start position:0%
except it moves it to a different court
 
06:07:29.458 --> 06:07:30.530 align:start position:0%
except it moves it to a different court
system

06:07:30.530 --> 06:07:30.540 align:start position:0%
system
 
06:07:32.570 --> 06:07:32.580 align:start position:0%
so to be clear
 
06:07:34.730 --> 06:07:34.740 align:start position:0%
this bill does not change the work of
 
06:07:37.010 --> 06:07:37.020 align:start position:0%
police officers on the street
 
06:07:41.208 --> 06:07:41.218 align:start position:0%
they can continue to seize property
 
06:07:43.548 --> 06:07:43.558 align:start position:0%
if they have probable cause of its
 
06:07:45.948 --> 06:07:45.958 align:start position:0%
association with a crime
 
06:07:50.628 --> 06:07:50.638 align:start position:0%
this bill changes a different
 
06:07:53.570 --> 06:07:53.580 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire official the work of
 
06:07:56.628 --> 06:07:56.638 align:start position:0%
lawyers State prosecutors in New
 
06:07:59.150 --> 06:07:59.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's New Hampshire and gives them
 
06:08:03.230 --> 06:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
the responsibility to litigate the
 
06:08:07.010 --> 06:08:07.020 align:start position:0%
transfer of title as part of the
 
06:08:07.020 --> 06:08:08.750 align:start position:0%
transfer of title as part of the
Criminal

06:08:08.750 --> 06:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
Criminal
 
06:08:08.760 --> 06:08:11.448 align:start position:0%
Criminal
prosecution

06:08:11.448 --> 06:08:11.458 align:start position:0%
prosecution
 
06:08:16.910 --> 06:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
it is consistent with work that laws and
 
06:08:18.830 --> 06:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
principles that New Hampshire has
 
06:08:21.948 --> 06:08:21.958 align:start position:0%
already enacted New Hampshire's current
 
06:08:25.970 --> 06:08:25.980 align:start position:0%
Law requires a conviction
 
06:08:28.330 --> 06:08:28.340 align:start position:0%
before civil
 
06:08:32.390 --> 06:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
this bill requires a conviction in
 
06:08:35.570 --> 06:08:35.580 align:start position:0%
criminal in criminal court so we are
 
06:08:38.868 --> 06:08:38.878 align:start position:0%
really just taking the Forum the venue
 
06:08:41.330 --> 06:08:41.340 align:start position:0%
the real estate
 
06:08:44.750 --> 06:08:44.760 align:start position:0%
of where this litigation takes place and
 
06:08:45.830 --> 06:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
puts it
 
06:08:47.990 --> 06:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
in the criminal prop in the criminal
 
06:08:48.000 --> 06:08:50.750 align:start position:0%
in the criminal prop in the criminal
process

06:08:50.750 --> 06:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:53.990 --> 06:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
how much money are we talking about
 
06:08:57.350 --> 06:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
in the last two years New Hampshire
 
06:09:01.750 --> 06:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
under state law has forfeited annually
 
06:09:04.788 --> 06:09:04.798 align:start position:0%
230 thousand dollars
 
06:09:07.788 --> 06:09:07.798 align:start position:0%
we are not talking about a large amount
 
06:09:12.650 --> 06:09:12.660 align:start position:0%
of money on any law enforcement's budget
 
06:09:15.048 --> 06:09:15.058 align:start position:0%
but we are talking about what it means
 
06:09:18.288 --> 06:09:18.298 align:start position:0%
to the individual to lose a 800 or a
 
06:09:21.530 --> 06:09:21.540 align:start position:0%
thousand or thirteen hundred dollars and
 
06:09:24.128 --> 06:09:24.138 align:start position:0%
then and when that individual does have
 
06:09:28.730 --> 06:09:28.740 align:start position:0%
the possibility of losing 800 or 1200 or
 
06:09:30.948 --> 06:09:30.958 align:start position:0%
1300 dollars
 
06:09:33.288 --> 06:09:33.298 align:start position:0%
they rationally give up
 
06:09:36.170 --> 06:09:36.180 align:start position:0%
they walk walk away
 
06:09:40.910 --> 06:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
they do not they they do not invest in a
 
06:09:42.650 --> 06:09:42.660 align:start position:0%
lawyer that might cost them four
 
06:09:45.770 --> 06:09:45.780 align:start position:0%
thousand to try to get back one one
 
06:09:45.780 --> 06:09:47.868 align:start position:0%
thousand to try to get back one one
thousand

06:09:47.868 --> 06:09:47.878 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
06:09:50.150 --> 06:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
because today
 
06:09:53.090 --> 06:09:53.100 align:start position:0%
the forfeiture takes place in Civil
 
06:09:55.250 --> 06:09:55.260 align:start position:0%
Court the good people and the public
 
06:09:57.890 --> 06:09:57.900 align:start position:0%
defender's office can't represent them
 
06:10:01.310 --> 06:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
they are prohibited Mr McGrath we we are
 
06:10:03.770 --> 06:10:03.780 align:start position:0%
limiting testimony and very good we've
 
06:10:06.230 --> 06:10:06.240 align:start position:0%
gone over about 30 seconds thank you so
 
06:10:10.190 --> 06:10:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:13.310 --> 06:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
the question about the federal the
 
06:10:15.770 --> 06:10:15.780 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
06:10:18.770 --> 06:10:18.780 align:start position:0%
the federal government has dual New
 
06:10:19.910 --> 06:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the federal government
 
06:10:22.310 --> 06:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
have dual jurisdiction
 
06:10:24.910 --> 06:10:24.920 align:start position:0%
all of the 99
 
06:10:29.810 --> 06:10:29.820 align:start position:0%
of this discussion is about state law
 
06:10:33.650 --> 06:10:33.660 align:start position:0%
but there is a component of federal law
 
06:10:36.288 --> 06:10:36.298 align:start position:0%
there are Joint Task forces there are
 
06:10:36.298 --> 06:10:38.510 align:start position:0%
there are Joint Task forces there are
adoptions

06:10:38.510 --> 06:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
adoptions
 
06:10:41.090 --> 06:10:41.100 align:start position:0%
there in the last three years there have
 
06:10:44.628 --> 06:10:44.638 align:start position:0%
only been nine adoptions this bill would
 
06:10:47.868 --> 06:10:47.878 align:start position:0%
stop those nine adoptions that
 
06:10:51.948 --> 06:10:51.958 align:start position:0%
constituted 85 000 over three years it
 
06:10:55.730 --> 06:10:55.740 align:start position:0%
would leave the more than 95 percent of
 
06:10:58.670 --> 06:10:58.680 align:start position:0%
the forfeitures done by Joint Task task
 
06:11:02.868 --> 06:11:02.878 align:start position:0%
forces tiny tiny tiny restriction on the
 
06:11:06.110 --> 06:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
use of federal adoptions
 
06:11:09.890 --> 06:11:09.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:12.110 --> 06:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
06:11:26.570 --> 06:11:26.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:28.310 --> 06:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Madam chair members of
 
06:11:30.770 --> 06:11:30.780 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is John Cunningham
 
06:11:32.208 --> 06:11:32.218 align:start position:0%
I'm a police officer with the city of
 
06:11:33.590 --> 06:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
Manchester I've been there for a little
 
06:11:36.048 --> 06:11:36.058 align:start position:0%
over 22 years
 
06:11:37.250 --> 06:11:37.260 align:start position:0%
um my current role as I'm Patrol
 
06:11:39.230 --> 06:11:39.240 align:start position:0%
Division commander and prior to that I
 
06:11:41.390 --> 06:11:41.400 align:start position:0%
was in charge I was the EXO executive
 
06:11:42.708 --> 06:11:42.718 align:start position:0%
officer of our special enforcement
 
06:11:44.750 --> 06:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
division which encompasses our drug unit
 
06:11:47.150 --> 06:11:47.160 align:start position:0%
an interdiction unit violent offenders
 
06:11:49.548 --> 06:11:49.558 align:start position:0%
unit and so and during all that I
 
06:11:52.548 --> 06:11:52.558 align:start position:0%
oversaw our asset forfeiture program uh
 
06:11:55.070 --> 06:11:55.080 align:start position:0%
we are testifying today uh in opposition
 
06:11:57.350 --> 06:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
of this bill as introduced I do not have
 
06:11:58.610 --> 06:11:58.620 align:start position:0%
the amendment in front of me and I'm
 
06:12:00.230 --> 06:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
happy to get you a copy of my testimony
 
06:12:03.170 --> 06:12:03.180 align:start position:0%
for your review as an email
 
06:12:05.030 --> 06:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
we are opposed to the bill because of if
 
06:12:06.410 --> 06:12:06.420 align:start position:0%
passed out will have a negative effect
 
06:12:08.448 --> 06:12:08.458 align:start position:0%
on our ability to conduct our counter
 
06:12:10.850 --> 06:12:10.860 align:start position:0%
drug operations it will have an harmful
 
06:12:13.490 --> 06:12:13.500 align:start position:0%
impact on our enforcement operations and
 
06:12:15.770 --> 06:12:15.780 align:start position:0%
it will cut funding that was intended to
 
06:12:17.510 --> 06:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
support our drug enforcement
 
06:12:19.070 --> 06:12:19.080 align:start position:0%
the primary purpose of the asset
 
06:12:20.750 --> 06:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
forfeiture is to support our enforcement
 
06:12:22.670 --> 06:12:22.680 align:start position:0%
role and its mission to stop the flow of
 
06:12:25.250 --> 06:12:25.260 align:start position:0%
illegal drugs into our state
 
06:12:27.530 --> 06:12:27.540 align:start position:0%
uh this I'll talk about both the state
 
06:12:29.570 --> 06:12:29.580 align:start position:0%
and the federal process both the state
 
06:12:31.128 --> 06:12:31.138 align:start position:0%
and the federal process I work closely
 
06:12:32.810 --> 06:12:32.820 align:start position:0%
with the Attorney General's office when
 
06:12:35.150 --> 06:12:35.160 align:start position:0%
I was managing the asset forfeiture they
 
06:12:36.650 --> 06:12:36.660 align:start position:0%
have a very
 
06:12:39.110 --> 06:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
um effective way of doing this right now
 
06:12:42.110 --> 06:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
due process is in place for the uh
 
06:12:45.110 --> 06:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
offenders when we do seize funds if it
 
06:12:47.270 --> 06:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
is going to go to forfeiture there is a
 
06:12:49.010 --> 06:12:49.020 align:start position:0%
process in place that ensures due
 
06:12:51.470 --> 06:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
process on both levels
 
06:12:54.530 --> 06:12:54.540 align:start position:0%
um in regards to uh just a testimony
 
06:12:56.570 --> 06:12:56.580 align:start position:0%
that was given a minute ago
 
06:12:59.030 --> 06:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
um reference to Federal asset forfeiture
 
06:13:01.270 --> 06:13:01.280 align:start position:0%
I I do have some numbers in front of me
 
06:13:05.448 --> 06:13:05.458 align:start position:0%
uh since and this is just Manchester but
 
06:13:10.368 --> 06:13:10.378 align:start position:0%
since 2017 on the federal side
 
06:13:14.230 --> 06:13:14.240 align:start position:0%
we've seen we've forfeited to our agency
 
06:13:18.830 --> 06:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
uh about 1.37 million
 
06:13:22.190 --> 06:13:22.200 align:start position:0%
um on the state side since 2017 we're
 
06:13:26.208 --> 06:13:26.218 align:start position:0%
about 207 thousand dollars in change
 
06:13:28.070 --> 06:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
just to give you an idea of kind of what
 
06:13:30.770 --> 06:13:30.780 align:start position:0%
we've seen over the years
 
06:13:33.590 --> 06:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
um this amendment uh as introduced would
 
06:13:35.570 --> 06:13:35.580 align:start position:0%
prohibit any adoptive federal seizures
 
06:13:38.208 --> 06:13:38.218 align:start position:0%
and prohibits uh accepting payment of
 
06:13:39.770 --> 06:13:39.780 align:start position:0%
any kind or distribution from the
 
06:13:42.048 --> 06:13:42.058 align:start position:0%
federal asset forfeiture program that's
 
06:13:44.350 --> 06:13:44.360 align:start position:0%
concerning to us for numerous reasons
 
06:13:46.730 --> 06:13:46.740 align:start position:0%
our federal state and local Partners
 
06:13:48.708 --> 06:13:48.718 align:start position:0%
work jointly to better serve the granite
 
06:13:48.718 --> 06:13:49.490 align:start position:0%
work jointly to better serve the granite
state

06:13:49.490 --> 06:13:49.500 align:start position:0%
state
 
06:13:51.948 --> 06:13:51.958 align:start position:0%
and our investigators result in legal
 
06:13:53.868 --> 06:13:53.878 align:start position:0%
seizures and assets from drug
 
06:13:56.390 --> 06:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
traffickers this bill would make it cost
 
06:13:58.548 --> 06:13:58.558 align:start position:0%
prohibited to participate in federal
 
06:14:01.610 --> 06:14:01.620 align:start position:0%
drug task force and this bill bars local
 
06:14:03.708 --> 06:14:03.718 align:start position:0%
agencies from entering into adoptive
 
06:14:07.190 --> 06:14:07.200 align:start position:0%
forfeiture with federal agencies this is
 
06:14:08.930 --> 06:14:08.940 align:start position:0%
extremely concerning because it's common
 
06:14:11.208 --> 06:14:11.218 align:start position:0%
for our agency to conduct investigations
 
06:14:14.270 --> 06:14:14.280 align:start position:0%
into offenders who initially might not
 
06:14:16.970 --> 06:14:16.980 align:start position:0%
be considered high-level traffickers and
 
06:14:18.350 --> 06:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
these investigations often do not
 
06:14:19.850 --> 06:14:19.860 align:start position:0%
include our federal Partners at the
 
06:14:21.470 --> 06:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
onset or even during the initial
 
06:14:23.090 --> 06:14:23.100 align:start position:0%
investigation itself
 
06:14:25.250 --> 06:14:25.260 align:start position:0%
we cannot often predict the seriousness
 
06:14:27.230 --> 06:14:27.240 align:start position:0%
of the drug trafficker until the
 
06:14:29.090 --> 06:14:29.100 align:start position:0%
investigation is well underway or even
 
06:14:31.610 --> 06:14:31.620 align:start position:0%
at the final stages and it's very common
 
06:14:33.470 --> 06:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
to request assistance from our federal
 
06:14:35.270 --> 06:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
Partners during the later stages of the
 
06:14:38.270 --> 06:14:38.280 align:start position:0%
investigation to adopt the case once we
 
06:14:40.670 --> 06:14:40.680 align:start position:0%
rationalize what resources we need to
 
06:14:42.830 --> 06:14:42.840 align:start position:0%
further the investigation and what
 
06:14:44.390 --> 06:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
courts are best suited to hold drug
 
06:14:46.010 --> 06:14:46.020 align:start position:0%
traffickers and violent offenders
 
06:14:48.110 --> 06:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
accountable for these actions
 
06:14:49.850 --> 06:14:49.860 align:start position:0%
the federal Equitable sharing program
 
06:14:52.070 --> 06:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
seizes and redistributes money directly
 
06:14:54.590 --> 06:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
to from criminals to New Hampshire law
 
06:14:56.990 --> 06:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement agencies the majority of the
 
06:14:58.128 --> 06:14:58.138 align:start position:0%
money goes back to the New Hampshire
 
06:15:00.410 --> 06:15:00.420 align:start position:0%
communities and allows us to carry out
 
06:15:02.930 --> 06:15:02.940 align:start position:0%
our drug enforcement Mission if passed
 
06:15:04.490 --> 06:15:04.500 align:start position:0%
this bill would have a negative impact
 
06:15:05.930 --> 06:15:05.940 align:start position:0%
on the majority of law enforcement
 
06:15:08.208 --> 06:15:08.218 align:start position:0%
agencies throughout the state and should
 
06:15:10.070 --> 06:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
our federal asset forfeiture funding
 
06:15:12.288 --> 06:15:12.298 align:start position:0%
become unavailable the burden for
 
06:15:14.448 --> 06:15:14.458 align:start position:0%
funding drug and Drug Enforcement could
 
06:15:16.788 --> 06:15:16.798 align:start position:0%
shift away from the drug traffickers and
 
06:15:19.610 --> 06:15:19.620 align:start position:0%
the profiteers to lawful taxpayers
 
06:15:21.048 --> 06:15:21.058 align:start position:0%
and the Manchester Police Department
 
06:15:23.330 --> 06:15:23.340 align:start position:0%
relies on federal asset for asset
 
06:15:25.628 --> 06:15:25.638 align:start position:0%
forfeiture funding to remain operational
 
06:15:28.368 --> 06:15:28.378 align:start position:0%
this is the bottom line if you restrict
 
06:15:31.010 --> 06:15:31.020 align:start position:0%
access to asset forfeiture funding to
 
06:15:33.948 --> 06:15:33.958 align:start position:0%
you're effectively defunding our drug
 
06:15:35.810 --> 06:15:35.820 align:start position:0%
enforcement and will allow drug
 
06:15:38.690 --> 06:15:38.700 align:start position:0%
traffickers to distribute more drugs in
 
06:15:40.610 --> 06:15:40.620 align:start position:0%
the community community so what we're a
 
06:15:43.190 --> 06:15:43.200 align:start position:0%
lot we're asking is to inexpedient to
 
06:15:44.990 --> 06:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
legislate this bill
 
06:15:46.970 --> 06:15:46.980 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions thank you
 
06:15:49.610 --> 06:15:49.620 align:start position:0%
for your testimony
 
06:15:51.650 --> 06:15:51.660 align:start position:0%
representative Noel
 
06:15:53.090 --> 06:15:53.100 align:start position:0%
thank you madam Sharon thank you for
 
06:15:54.708 --> 06:15:54.718 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
06:15:57.230 --> 06:15:57.240 align:start position:0%
um so the the amounts that you gave were
 
06:16:00.048 --> 06:16:00.058 align:start position:0%
since 2017 can you tell me how long this
 
06:16:01.788 --> 06:16:01.798 align:start position:0%
has been going on for
 
06:16:04.430 --> 06:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
when we started forfeiture
 
06:16:07.070 --> 06:16:07.080 align:start position:0%
I don't have a start date or when we I
 
06:16:10.250 --> 06:16:10.260 align:start position:0%
don't go I don't have anything past that
 
06:16:12.650 --> 06:16:12.660 align:start position:0%
um I I was in the drug unit itself and
 
06:16:15.530 --> 06:16:15.540 align:start position:0%
from 2013 I was doing it then and we
 
06:16:17.270 --> 06:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
were doing it long before so I don't
 
06:16:18.948 --> 06:16:18.958 align:start position:0%
have an exact start date for you I'm
 
06:16:20.270 --> 06:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
sorry I can find out for you and get
 
06:16:22.788 --> 06:16:22.798 align:start position:0%
back to you thank you
 
06:16:24.650 --> 06:16:24.660 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler
 
06:16:26.810 --> 06:16:26.820 align:start position:0%
chair representative Lynn and a few
 
06:16:28.610 --> 06:16:28.620 align:start position:0%
others who testified in support of the
 
06:16:31.850 --> 06:16:31.860 align:start position:0%
bill were fairly clear that this doesn't
 
06:16:36.230 --> 06:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
impact Federal uh forfeiture and the
 
06:16:38.448 --> 06:16:38.458 align:start position:0%
practice of forfeiture so I'm I would
 
06:16:40.070 --> 06:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
just like you to elaborate a little bit
 
06:16:42.830 --> 06:16:42.840 align:start position:0%
more on how this would affect your
 
06:16:45.350 --> 06:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
Department's ability to enforce
 
06:16:49.670 --> 06:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
forfeiture sure and as I testify I'm I'm
 
06:16:52.310 --> 06:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
I'm testifying as the bill is introduced
 
06:16:53.810 --> 06:16:53.820 align:start position:0%
I do not have an amendment in front of
 
06:16:55.190 --> 06:16:55.200 align:start position:0%
me if there is one and I apologize for
 
06:16:55.200 --> 06:16:56.208 align:start position:0%
me if there is one and I apologize for
that

06:16:56.208 --> 06:16:56.218 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:16:56.218 --> 06:16:56.810 align:start position:0%
that
um

06:16:56.810 --> 06:16:56.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:17:01.090 --> 06:17:01.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:03.650 --> 06:17:03.660 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna go off what was Andrews that's
 
06:17:05.150 --> 06:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
before I started reading through all
 
06:17:07.610 --> 06:17:07.620 align:start position:0%
that but if anything's changed
 
06:17:07.620 --> 06:17:09.830 align:start position:0%
that but if anything's changed
um

06:17:09.830 --> 06:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:11.990 --> 06:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
the way it's worded in the current in
 
06:17:13.610 --> 06:17:13.620 align:start position:0%
the bill that was introduced is no State
 
06:17:15.708 --> 06:17:15.718 align:start position:0%
local or law enforcement agency she'll
 
06:17:17.990 --> 06:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
transfer or offer for an adoption
 
06:17:20.390 --> 06:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
property seized under state law to a
 
06:17:21.770 --> 06:17:21.780 align:start position:0%
federal Agency for the purpose of
 
06:17:23.628 --> 06:17:23.638 align:start position:0%
forfeiture under Federal controlled
 
06:17:27.650 --> 06:17:27.660 align:start position:0%
substance ACT public law 91-513.
 
06:17:27.660 --> 06:17:29.030 align:start position:0%
substance ACT public law 91-513.
so

06:17:29.030 --> 06:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:17:32.628 --> 06:17:32.638 align:start position:0%
Our concern is that if we if we do not
 
06:17:34.850 --> 06:17:34.860 align:start position:0%
have these federal agencies we have
 
06:17:36.590 --> 06:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
numerous Task Force officers at a
 
06:17:38.090 --> 06:17:38.100 align:start position:0%
Manchester police officers assigned to
 
06:17:39.650 --> 06:17:39.660 align:start position:0%
federal agencies if we do not include
 
06:17:41.208 --> 06:17:41.218 align:start position:0%
the federal agencies right off the bat
 
06:17:43.970 --> 06:17:43.980 align:start position:0%
with the initial on-sar onstart of the
 
06:17:46.010 --> 06:17:46.020 align:start position:0%
initial investigation we will not have
 
06:17:48.708 --> 06:17:48.718 align:start position:0%
the ability to Forfeit property through
 
06:17:50.208 --> 06:17:50.218 align:start position:0%
the federal government
 
06:17:52.970 --> 06:17:52.980 align:start position:0%
and take that case asset forfeiture-wise
 
06:17:54.650 --> 06:17:54.660 align:start position:0%
through the federal government it's not
 
06:17:56.750 --> 06:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
uncommon for us to start a case
 
06:17:59.090 --> 06:17:59.100 align:start position:0%
into a drug trafficker or small level
 
06:18:01.430 --> 06:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
dealer and we expand the case as we go
 
06:18:03.650 --> 06:18:03.660 align:start position:0%
we arrest people we conduct more
 
06:18:05.570 --> 06:18:05.580 align:start position:0%
investigations interviews do our thing
 
06:18:08.270 --> 06:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
and then as the case expands we realize
 
06:18:09.650 --> 06:18:09.660 align:start position:0%
that this might be a cross-border
 
06:18:11.750 --> 06:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
initiative this drug trafficking
 
06:18:13.730 --> 06:18:13.740 align:start position:0%
organization might be larger in scope we
 
06:18:15.470 --> 06:18:15.480 align:start position:0%
might need additional resources through
 
06:18:17.330 --> 06:18:17.340 align:start position:0%
our federal partners and that's when we
 
06:18:18.770 --> 06:18:18.780 align:start position:0%
bring it to the federal Partners not
 
06:18:19.970 --> 06:18:19.980 align:start position:0%
always from the OnStar to the
 
06:18:19.980 --> 06:18:21.170 align:start position:0%
always from the OnStar to the
investigation

06:18:21.170 --> 06:18:21.180 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
06:18:22.810 --> 06:18:22.820 align:start position:0%
and we also obviously look into
 
06:18:24.948 --> 06:18:24.958 align:start position:0%
sentencing guidelines and whatnot that
 
06:18:26.330 --> 06:18:26.340 align:start position:0%
might be more effective when targeting
 
06:18:29.628 --> 06:18:29.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:31.788 --> 06:18:31.798 align:start position:0%
follow up and you're saying this
 
06:18:33.530 --> 06:18:33.540 align:start position:0%
restricts your right to go to the
 
06:18:37.670 --> 06:18:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:39.830 --> 06:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
Captain we have an extra copy of the
 
06:18:42.788 --> 06:18:42.798 align:start position:0%
amendment if we somebody gave it to you
 
06:18:46.010 --> 06:18:46.020 align:start position:0%
would you be as kind to review the
 
06:18:48.530 --> 06:18:48.540 align:start position:0%
amendment and if your opinion or your
 
06:18:50.448 --> 06:18:50.458 align:start position:0%
stance changes could you let the
 
06:18:51.708 --> 06:18:51.718 align:start position:0%
committee know would you be willing to
 
06:18:53.448 --> 06:18:53.458 align:start position:0%
come back and and talk with us after
 
06:18:56.030 --> 06:18:56.040 align:start position:0%
that of course okay
 
06:18:59.390 --> 06:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
representative Pratt thank you
 
06:19:01.430 --> 06:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
as anybody can answer that because it's
 
06:19:03.230 --> 06:19:03.240 align:start position:0%
a complete rewrite of this bill so the
 
06:19:04.490 --> 06:19:04.500 align:start position:0%
people that we wrote to Bill can they
 
06:19:14.448 --> 06:19:14.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:16.190 --> 06:19:16.200 align:start position:0%
I don't think that he can speak for oh
 
06:19:18.230 --> 06:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
you wanted somebody else that yes oh
 
06:19:18.240 --> 06:19:19.368 align:start position:0%
you wanted somebody else that yes oh
okay

06:19:19.368 --> 06:19:19.378 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:19:20.868 --> 06:19:20.878 align:start position:0%
this is a complete rewrite of the bill
 
06:19:22.548 --> 06:19:22.558 align:start position:0%
well that would be that would be
 
06:19:33.410 --> 06:19:33.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:33.420 --> 06:19:34.490 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

06:19:34.490 --> 06:19:34.500 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:19:36.890 --> 06:19:36.900 align:start position:0%
and they can do Joint Task of course
 
06:19:36.900 --> 06:19:40.390 align:start position:0%
and they can do Joint Task of course
yeah

06:19:40.390 --> 06:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:43.730 --> 06:19:43.740 align:start position:0%
hey thanks thank you for the question so
 
06:19:45.830 --> 06:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
so if I understand the question you want
 
06:19:47.090 --> 06:19:47.100 align:start position:0%
to know
 
06:19:50.030 --> 06:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
um the relationship between Federal and
 
06:19:52.190 --> 06:19:52.200 align:start position:0%
and local law enforcement how has it
 
06:19:54.470 --> 06:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
changed by the bill right so first of
 
06:19:54.480 --> 06:19:55.128 align:start position:0%
changed by the bill right so first of
all

06:19:55.128 --> 06:19:55.138 align:start position:0%
all
 
06:19:58.010 --> 06:19:58.020 align:start position:0%
nothing about operations has changed
 
06:20:00.470 --> 06:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
right this is about what happens in
 
06:20:03.830 --> 06:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
court later on right so
 
06:20:07.190 --> 06:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
um adoptions is specifically a case
 
06:20:07.200 --> 06:20:09.170 align:start position:0%
um adoptions is specifically a case
where

06:20:09.170 --> 06:20:09.180 align:start position:0%
where
 
06:20:12.048 --> 06:20:12.058 align:start position:0%
um the state level uh state troopers
 
06:20:14.150 --> 06:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
local police Etc
 
06:20:16.910 --> 06:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
decide what to do with a case they
 
06:20:19.128 --> 06:20:19.138 align:start position:0%
decide to call up the Federal prosecutor
 
06:20:20.868 --> 06:20:20.878 align:start position:0%
and say how would you like to to
 
06:20:23.930 --> 06:20:23.940 align:start position:0%
prosecute this case or they call up the
 
06:20:26.750 --> 06:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
County prosecutor or their local I
 
06:20:28.010 --> 06:20:28.020 align:start position:0%
assume Manchester has their own
 
06:20:29.330 --> 06:20:29.340 align:start position:0%
prosecutor but
 
06:20:32.770 --> 06:20:32.780 align:start position:0%
um to prosecute the case right so
 
06:20:35.750 --> 06:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
this has those kind of cases have gone
 
06:20:39.288 --> 06:20:39.298 align:start position:0%
to Federal prosecutors nine times of the
 
06:20:40.788 --> 06:20:40.798 align:start position:0%
last three years
 
06:20:43.570 --> 06:20:43.580 align:start position:0%
as opposed to the million dollar stuff
 
06:20:47.470 --> 06:20:47.480 align:start position:0%
that's where federal agents and and
 
06:20:50.208 --> 06:20:50.218 align:start position:0%
local police have worked together all
 
06:20:52.670 --> 06:20:52.680 align:start position:0%
along through the case and and they go
 
06:20:55.070 --> 06:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
to Federal Court frequently right that's
 
06:20:56.750 --> 06:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
the million dollar stuff the other stuff
 
06:20:59.930 --> 06:20:59.940 align:start position:0%
we're talking about is Small Potatoes
 
06:21:02.090 --> 06:21:02.100 align:start position:0%
kind of thing and and this bill does
 
06:21:04.730 --> 06:21:04.740 align:start position:0%
take those nine cases out of federal
 
06:21:08.208 --> 06:21:08.218 align:start position:0%
court and puts them in State Court
 
06:21:10.368 --> 06:21:10.378 align:start position:0%
Senator Newman yeah I just have a quick
 
06:21:13.548 --> 06:21:13.558 align:start position:0%
question could somebody look at the the
 
06:21:15.708 --> 06:21:15.718 align:start position:0%
Amendment and just point to where
 
06:21:17.990 --> 06:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
adoptions are in there I'm trying to
 
06:21:21.650 --> 06:21:21.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:22.910 --> 06:21:22.920 align:start position:0%
I think
 
06:21:24.830 --> 06:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
and can I just offer something in
 
06:21:26.270 --> 06:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
rebuttal to that
 
06:21:29.810 --> 06:21:29.820 align:start position:0%
um so the the Federal Form I've been
 
06:21:31.010 --> 06:21:31.020 align:start position:0%
doing this for the last couple years for
 
06:21:33.708 --> 06:21:33.718 align:start position:0%
the agency in Manchester he says only
 
06:21:36.830 --> 06:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
nine instances of uh Federal adoptions I
 
06:21:39.110 --> 06:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
think is how we put it that we that I
 
06:21:41.208 --> 06:21:41.218 align:start position:0%
guess as a state he can track US taking
 
06:21:43.190 --> 06:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
through the federal government I would
 
06:21:46.010 --> 06:21:46.020 align:start position:0%
say that is extremely not accurate and
 
06:21:48.890 --> 06:21:48.900 align:start position:0%
and only because when we file an
 
06:21:50.510 --> 06:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
adoption through the federal government
 
06:21:53.330 --> 06:21:53.340 align:start position:0%
they have obviously a long process to go
 
06:21:55.250 --> 06:21:55.260 align:start position:0%
through too before the adoption is
 
06:21:58.010 --> 06:21:58.020 align:start position:0%
either finalized or ruled on and the
 
06:22:00.170 --> 06:22:00.180 align:start position:0%
wheels of Justice sometimes are not
 
06:22:03.170 --> 06:22:03.180 align:start position:0%
fast on the federal side either and the
 
06:22:05.868 --> 06:22:05.878 align:start position:0%
um so we I can tell you that Manchester
 
06:22:08.628 --> 06:22:08.638 align:start position:0%
I and I'm just I'm ballparking it right
 
06:22:11.330 --> 06:22:11.340 align:start position:0%
now but probably has well over 50
 
06:22:13.970 --> 06:22:13.980 align:start position:0%
pending Federal asset forfeiture
 
06:22:16.128 --> 06:22:16.138 align:start position:0%
adoptions that are still being in a
 
06:22:19.368 --> 06:22:19.378 align:start position:0%
pending State and I've probably filed
 
06:22:22.128 --> 06:22:22.138 align:start position:0%
I'm guessing don't hold me to it but
 
06:22:25.730 --> 06:22:25.740 align:start position:0%
probably 20 or 25 in the last year or so
 
06:22:28.128 --> 06:22:28.138 align:start position:0%
maybe a year and a half alone I would
 
06:22:29.270 --> 06:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
guess through the federal government
 
06:22:31.070 --> 06:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
through the federal agencies as
 
06:22:31.080 --> 06:22:32.448 align:start position:0%
through the federal agencies as
adoptions

06:22:32.448 --> 06:22:32.458 align:start position:0%
adoptions
 
06:22:34.310 --> 06:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
thank you and then just to give you an
 
06:22:36.530 --> 06:22:36.540 align:start position:0%
idea of what's going on
 
06:22:38.628 --> 06:22:38.638 align:start position:0%
everybody good
 
06:22:41.090 --> 06:22:41.100 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no more questions thank you
 
06:22:41.100 --> 06:22:44.990 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no more questions thank you
gentlemen

06:22:44.990 --> 06:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:47.030 --> 06:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
they weren't answered maybe they can
 
06:22:50.510 --> 06:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
provide it later on uh
 
06:22:53.628 --> 06:22:53.638 align:start position:0%
I'm just looking representative Lynn did
 
06:22:55.128 --> 06:22:55.138 align:start position:0%
you have anything that you could add to
 
06:22:57.288 --> 06:22:57.298 align:start position:0%
help with the questions that seem not to
 
06:23:02.208 --> 06:23:02.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:04.190 --> 06:23:04.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't look like
 
06:23:06.650 --> 06:23:06.660 align:start position:0%
okay it's okay I I was just questioned
 
06:23:10.868 --> 06:23:10.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:13.610 --> 06:23:13.620 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry I I thought the the
 
06:23:14.930 --> 06:23:14.940 align:start position:0%
question was more about the the
 
06:23:17.330 --> 06:23:17.340 align:start position:0%
amendment my question was only about
 
06:23:19.610 --> 06:23:19.620 align:start position:0%
where is it in the bill that discusses
 
06:23:22.190 --> 06:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
adoptions yes from the federal
 
06:23:23.930 --> 06:23:23.940 align:start position:0%
government I just would like to be able
 
06:23:25.548 --> 06:23:25.558 align:start position:0%
to read it if I could find it yeah no no
 
06:23:27.770 --> 06:23:27.780 align:start position:0%
that's a good one hang on one second I
 
06:23:29.090 --> 06:23:29.100 align:start position:0%
just had it
 
06:23:29.100 --> 06:23:32.650 align:start position:0%
just had it
um

06:23:32.650 --> 06:23:32.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:36.110 --> 06:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
right yes that's right of the uh of the
 
06:23:37.788 --> 06:23:37.798 align:start position:0%
amendment it's of the amendment it's

it's on page nine
 
06:23:42.770 --> 06:23:42.780 align:start position:0%

representative

06:23:52.850 --> 06:23:52.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:11.810 --> 06:24:11.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:13.310 --> 06:24:13.320 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Madam chair members of
 
06:24:14.570 --> 06:24:14.580 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Richard head
 
06:24:16.310 --> 06:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
I'm the government Affairs coordinator
 
06:24:19.010 --> 06:24:19.020 align:start position:0%
for the judicial branch the judicial
 
06:24:21.170 --> 06:24:21.180 align:start position:0%
branch has no policy no position on the
 
06:24:23.270 --> 06:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
policies underlying this bill we have
 
06:24:25.070 --> 06:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
very strong position relative to the
 
06:24:27.110 --> 06:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
bill as drafted we opposed the bill is
 
06:24:29.868 --> 06:24:29.878 align:start position:0%
drafted and believe that the bill is
 
06:24:34.090 --> 06:24:34.100 align:start position:0%
drafted uh introduces significant
 
06:24:36.830 --> 06:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
procedural barriers that if it were to
 
06:24:38.810 --> 06:24:38.820 align:start position:0%
be implemented parts of it would simply
 
06:24:42.230 --> 06:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
could not be implemented by the judicial
 
06:24:44.750 --> 06:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
branch and I will explain explain some
 
06:24:46.610 --> 06:24:46.620 align:start position:0%
of those uh briefly
 
06:24:49.730 --> 06:24:49.740 align:start position:0%
first though I do want to uh express my
 
06:24:52.730 --> 06:24:52.740 align:start position:0%
appreciation to the to the sponsor and
 
06:24:53.990 --> 06:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
the people who've been drafting this
 
06:24:56.690 --> 06:24:56.700 align:start position:0%
they have been working very hard and I
 
06:24:58.330 --> 06:24:58.340 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
 
06:25:02.650 --> 06:25:02.660 align:start position:0%
but at the end of the day it is still
 
06:25:06.470 --> 06:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
substantially far from a a bill that we
 
06:25:08.150 --> 06:25:08.160 align:start position:0%
could Implement in the judicial branch
 
06:25:10.430 --> 06:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
as at least as written
 
06:25:12.410 --> 06:25:12.420 align:start position:0%
in addition
 
06:25:13.970 --> 06:25:13.980 align:start position:0%
because I didn't want to simply be
 
06:25:16.368 --> 06:25:16.378 align:start position:0%
negative about this bill and it's a bill
 
06:25:17.930 --> 06:25:17.940 align:start position:0%
that's been around for a couple years
 
06:25:20.570 --> 06:25:20.580 align:start position:0%
now I've been trying to express some of
 
06:25:22.190 --> 06:25:22.200 align:start position:0%
the concerns that the judicial branch
 
06:25:26.810 --> 06:25:26.820 align:start position:0%
has I did try a draft of of an amendment
 
06:25:29.208 --> 06:25:29.218 align:start position:0%
to the current law that I thought at
 
06:25:31.430 --> 06:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
least implemented a lot of the policies
 
06:25:33.530 --> 06:25:33.540 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to be implemented
 
06:25:35.990 --> 06:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
through this bill so I drafted and it's
 
06:25:37.970 --> 06:25:37.980 align:start position:0%
relatively short a bill that would
 
06:25:39.410 --> 06:25:39.420 align:start position:0%
change it from being an attorney general
 
06:25:42.410 --> 06:25:42.420 align:start position:0%
process to a prosecutor process that
 
06:25:44.270 --> 06:25:44.280 align:start position:0%
would require the public defender to
 
06:25:46.128 --> 06:25:46.138 align:start position:0%
continue to participate in this where
 
06:25:47.750 --> 06:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
they are not currently participating
 
06:25:50.150 --> 06:25:50.160 align:start position:0%
that the forfeiture could not occur
 
06:25:53.330 --> 06:25:53.340 align:start position:0%
until conviction that the that there be
 
06:25:55.430 --> 06:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
a minimum value of the property that is
 
06:25:57.110 --> 06:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
subject to forfeiture and that there be
 
06:25:59.570 --> 06:25:59.580 align:start position:0%
noticed to interested parties and I
 
06:26:01.368 --> 06:26:01.378 align:start position:0%
circulated that bill because it was a
 
06:26:02.930 --> 06:26:02.940 align:start position:0%
version of the bill that we could have
 
06:26:05.270 --> 06:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
implemented and I was told no that's not
 
06:26:07.368 --> 06:26:07.378 align:start position:0%
what we want to do it's okay so I went
 
06:26:11.448 --> 06:26:11.458 align:start position:0%
back to the bill as as their their uh as
 
06:26:13.610 --> 06:26:13.620 align:start position:0%
they proposed it in the comments I have
 
06:26:15.410 --> 06:26:15.420 align:start position:0%
will be on the version of it that's the
 
06:26:17.150 --> 06:26:17.160 align:start position:0%
amendment not the version as as
 
06:26:17.160 --> 06:26:18.650 align:start position:0%
amendment not the version as as
introduced

06:26:18.650 --> 06:26:18.660 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
06:26:21.170 --> 06:26:21.180 align:start position:0%
and one of the problems is that as as
 
06:26:23.390 --> 06:26:23.400 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn said you know what
 
06:26:25.010 --> 06:26:25.020 align:start position:0%
are all the steps can be worked out
 
06:26:27.170 --> 06:26:27.180 align:start position:0%
essentially that that there's a lot of
 
06:26:30.110 --> 06:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
discretion given to the courts and there
 
06:26:32.750 --> 06:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
are Provisions where the court is given
 
06:26:35.868 --> 06:26:35.878 align:start position:0%
a lot of discretion the problem is this
 
06:26:39.350 --> 06:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
bill implements through statute specific
 
06:26:42.350 --> 06:26:42.360 align:start position:0%
steps so we cannot change those steps
 
06:26:43.910 --> 06:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
through a policy because you are
 
06:26:46.548 --> 06:26:46.558 align:start position:0%
building into a very long Bill very
 
06:26:49.490 --> 06:26:49.500 align:start position:0%
precise steps and each of those steps
 
06:26:51.650 --> 06:26:51.660 align:start position:0%
now has to be followed because it is now
 
06:26:54.650 --> 06:26:54.660 align:start position:0%
it would be a statute so while there are
 
06:26:56.930 --> 06:26:56.940 align:start position:0%
Provisions that give discretion such as
 
06:26:59.390 --> 06:26:59.400 align:start position:0%
timing of certain hearings there are
 
06:27:01.910 --> 06:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
other things that say okay the statute
 
06:27:05.330 --> 06:27:05.340 align:start position:0%
says x x is now the law and that's what
 
06:27:07.070 --> 06:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
has to be done
 
06:27:10.490 --> 06:27:10.500 align:start position:0%
uh in light of the three minutes I'm not
 
06:27:11.930 --> 06:27:11.940 align:start position:0%
sure if those were a lawyer three
 
06:27:13.788 --> 06:27:13.798 align:start position:0%
minutes I would have plenty of time but
 
06:27:15.230 --> 06:27:15.240 align:start position:0%
I don't I assume you did not mean a
 
06:27:17.868 --> 06:27:17.878 align:start position:0%
lawyer's three minutes uh I will stick
 
06:27:19.610 --> 06:27:19.620 align:start position:0%
to although it was a fiscal committee
 
06:27:21.230 --> 06:27:21.240 align:start position:0%
minute I would have a couple hours or
 
06:27:23.208 --> 06:27:23.218 align:start position:0%
even days but um
 
06:27:25.548 --> 06:27:25.558 align:start position:0%
I will I'm just going to identify a
 
06:27:27.708 --> 06:27:27.718 align:start position:0%
couple of the procedural issues with the
 
06:27:29.930 --> 06:27:29.940 align:start position:0%
understanding that I can go through
 
06:27:34.010 --> 06:27:34.020 align:start position:0%
multiple pages in within a page find you
 
06:27:37.070 --> 06:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
know 10 12 problems that simply have not
 
06:27:40.010 --> 06:27:40.020 align:start position:0%
been addressed and Mr head if it helps
 
06:27:42.708 --> 06:27:42.718 align:start position:0%
you I do believe that uh chairman Roy is
 
06:27:44.628 --> 06:27:44.638 align:start position:0%
going to make a subcommittee for this
 
06:27:46.850 --> 06:27:46.860 align:start position:0%
legislation it would probably be a great
 
06:27:49.730 --> 06:27:49.740 align:start position:0%
idea for you to come to that and I'm
 
06:27:52.190 --> 06:27:52.200 align:start position:0%
always happy and I'm absolutely happy to
 
06:27:53.930 --> 06:27:53.940 align:start position:0%
participate in this process if there's a
 
06:27:55.910 --> 06:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
way of improving this bill I'm happy to
 
06:27:59.030 --> 06:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
to be involved in that process just a
 
06:28:01.970 --> 06:28:01.980 align:start position:0%
couple of of examples and then I will
 
06:28:04.970 --> 06:28:04.980 align:start position:0%
stop talking page four beginning on line
 
06:28:07.788 --> 06:28:07.798 align:start position:0%
seven is a process that is about seizure
 
06:28:10.070 --> 06:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
so really not even into the forfeiture
 
06:28:12.650 --> 06:28:12.660 align:start position:0%
process here but we're talking about the
 
06:28:15.350 --> 06:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
seizure and it gives the right following
 
06:28:18.110 --> 06:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
seizure for a defendant which is
 
06:28:20.030 --> 06:28:20.040 align:start position:0%
interesting or any other person with an
 
06:28:22.430 --> 06:28:22.440 align:start position:0%
interest in the property to have a right
 
06:28:25.490 --> 06:28:25.500 align:start position:0%
to file uh to a right to a post seizure
 
06:28:28.190 --> 06:28:28.200 align:start position:0%
hearing okay in and of itself that is
 
06:28:28.200 --> 06:28:29.690 align:start position:0%
hearing okay in and of itself that is
fine

06:28:29.690 --> 06:28:29.700 align:start position:0%
fine
 
06:28:31.970 --> 06:28:31.980 align:start position:0%
um and then it goes on to parag line
 
06:28:34.430 --> 06:28:34.440 align:start position:0%
nine it says a person with an interest
 
06:28:37.128 --> 06:28:37.138 align:start position:0%
in the property May file a motion with
 
06:28:39.830 --> 06:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
the Superior Court a motion is something
 
06:28:42.288 --> 06:28:42.298 align:start position:0%
you put into a case
 
06:28:44.628 --> 06:28:44.638 align:start position:0%
depending on when somebody tries to file
 
06:28:46.970 --> 06:28:46.980 align:start position:0%
that motion this case may not be in
 
06:28:48.708 --> 06:28:48.718 align:start position:0%
Superior Court there may be no criminal
 
06:28:51.230 --> 06:28:51.240 align:start position:0%
case in the Superior Court you go to the
 
06:28:52.850 --> 06:28:52.860 align:start position:0%
electronic filing system I want to file
 
06:28:54.890 --> 06:28:54.900 align:start position:0%
a motion and there's nothing to stick
 
06:28:56.990 --> 06:28:57.000 align:start position:0%
that in because the case might be in the
 
06:29:00.770 --> 06:29:00.780 align:start position:0%
circuit court it's just a a it's a
 
06:29:03.350 --> 06:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
technical defect but it is a a process
 
06:29:05.208 --> 06:29:05.218 align:start position:0%
that is written into the law so the law
 
06:29:07.788 --> 06:29:07.798 align:start position:0%
has to be accurate and I very much
 
06:29:10.310 --> 06:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
appreciate the sponsor and Mr McGrath's
 
06:29:12.470 --> 06:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
efforts to take what was in the original
 
06:29:14.690 --> 06:29:14.700 align:start position:0%
Bill where put a lot of stuff in the
 
06:29:17.330 --> 06:29:17.340 align:start position:0%
circuit court and put it in Superior it
 
06:29:19.850 --> 06:29:19.860 align:start position:0%
is not completely there yet
 
06:29:22.010 --> 06:29:22.020 align:start position:0%
the other aspect of even just this part
 
06:29:23.930 --> 06:29:23.940 align:start position:0%
about seizure because it is the
 
06:29:26.208 --> 06:29:26.218 align:start position:0%
defendant who is who has the right to
 
06:29:28.670 --> 06:29:28.680 align:start position:0%
opposed seizure hearing that one of the
 
06:29:31.490 --> 06:29:31.500 align:start position:0%
criteria which is on line 23 would be to
 
06:29:33.948 --> 06:29:33.958 align:start position:0%
say that the court May order return of
 
06:29:35.990 --> 06:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
the property if the by a preponderance
 
06:29:37.610 --> 06:29:37.620 align:start position:0%
of the evidence it finds the seizure
 
06:29:39.770 --> 06:29:39.780 align:start position:0%
wasn't valid that is in the criminal
 
06:29:42.288 --> 06:29:42.298 align:start position:0%
case essentially the motion to suppress
 
06:29:44.628 --> 06:29:44.638 align:start position:0%
hearing the defendant has the right to
 
06:29:46.490 --> 06:29:46.500 align:start position:0%
file a motion to suppress hearing to say
 
06:29:49.070 --> 06:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
that the evidence that you gathered was
 
06:29:50.930 --> 06:29:50.940 align:start position:0%
unconstitutionally got whatever it may
 
06:29:53.470 --> 06:29:53.480 align:start position:0%
be that is a a
 
06:29:56.690 --> 06:29:56.700 align:start position:0%
motion to suppress hearing that is now
 
06:29:58.730 --> 06:29:58.740 align:start position:0%
being heard through the separate process
 
06:30:01.910 --> 06:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
in Superior Court where that may not be
 
06:30:04.128 --> 06:30:04.138 align:start position:0%
you know it really should just be that's
 
06:30:06.650 --> 06:30:06.660 align:start position:0%
a part of the Criminal Case itself and
 
06:30:06.660 --> 06:30:07.548 align:start position:0%
a part of the Criminal Case itself and
not

06:30:07.548 --> 06:30:07.558 align:start position:0%
not
 
06:30:09.590 --> 06:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
a separate doesn't need the separate
 
06:30:09.600 --> 06:30:11.690 align:start position:0%
a separate doesn't need the separate
statute

06:30:11.690 --> 06:30:11.700 align:start position:0%
statute
 
06:30:14.208 --> 06:30:14.218 align:start position:0%
another part of of and I'll make this my
 
06:30:15.948 --> 06:30:15.958 align:start position:0%
last example understanding there are a
 
06:30:18.770 --> 06:30:18.780 align:start position:0%
ton of them page four still this is
 
06:30:21.048 --> 06:30:21.058 align:start position:0%
beginning in line 28 where the forfeits
 
06:30:23.750 --> 06:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
are part of the of the bill starts and
 
06:30:25.670 --> 06:30:25.680 align:start position:0%
it says that the motion
 
06:30:27.410 --> 06:30:27.420 align:start position:0%
um in a case in which the state seeks
 
06:30:29.990 --> 06:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
forfeiture of property the state shall
 
06:30:32.030 --> 06:30:32.040 align:start position:0%
file with the court emotion for
 
06:30:35.448 --> 06:30:35.458 align:start position:0%
forfeiture that motion shall be a
 
06:30:37.670 --> 06:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
separate document and accompany the
 
06:30:39.470 --> 06:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
initial or subsequent indictment or
 
06:30:42.048 --> 06:30:42.058 align:start position:0%
information so in Superior Court the
 
06:30:44.628 --> 06:30:44.638 align:start position:0%
indictment process doesn't have a motion
 
06:30:46.970 --> 06:30:46.980 align:start position:0%
filed with it and it normally wouldn't
 
06:30:50.390 --> 06:30:50.400 align:start position:0%
because the indictment is a grand jury
 
06:30:53.990 --> 06:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
process so prosecutors working with the
 
06:30:56.330 --> 06:30:56.340 align:start position:0%
grand jury ultimately gets to a point
 
06:30:58.010 --> 06:30:58.020 align:start position:0%
where the prosecutor
 
06:31:00.288 --> 06:31:00.298 align:start position:0%
provides the grand jury with a proposed
 
06:31:02.330 --> 06:31:02.340 align:start position:0%
indictment prosecutor leaves the
 
06:31:04.788 --> 06:31:04.798 align:start position:0%
proposed indictment then is discussed
 
06:31:07.190 --> 06:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
and voted on by the grand jury if they
 
06:31:10.310 --> 06:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
decide to indict Foreman signs and the
 
06:31:12.230 --> 06:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
clerk then picks up the indictment and
 
06:31:14.868 --> 06:31:14.878 align:start position:0%
it becomes a court case the prosecutor
 
06:31:17.270 --> 06:31:17.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a motion to file in that
 
06:31:20.208 --> 06:31:20.218 align:start position:0%
proceeding at that stage but it is
 
06:31:23.390 --> 06:31:23.400 align:start position:0%
required that it be that by Statute that
 
06:31:24.948 --> 06:31:24.958 align:start position:0%
the motion shall be a separate document
 
06:31:27.368 --> 06:31:27.378 align:start position:0%
and accompany the initial
 
06:31:32.090 --> 06:31:32.100 align:start position:0%
indictment so it is it is in the current
 
06:31:34.128 --> 06:31:34.138 align:start position:0%
process not something that would be
 
06:31:36.288 --> 06:31:36.298 align:start position:0%
contemplated I could do it Page by page
 
06:31:38.150 --> 06:31:38.160 align:start position:0%
I won't
 
06:31:42.048 --> 06:31:42.058 align:start position:0%
um uh and I will end my comments with
 
06:31:43.330 --> 06:31:43.340 align:start position:0%
that and be happy to answer questions
 
06:31:47.470 --> 06:31:47.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:49.430 --> 06:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
representative you have a question I
 
06:31:50.750 --> 06:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
just have a question for you I'm just
 
06:31:52.190 --> 06:31:52.200 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could explore the
 
06:31:53.930 --> 06:31:53.940 align:start position:0%
possibility that since this is a public
 
06:31:55.670 --> 06:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
hearing probably not the place to do all
 
06:31:57.350 --> 06:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
of this that whether there's a
 
06:31:59.448 --> 06:31:59.458 align:start position:0%
subcommittee or not a subcommittee that
 
06:32:01.070 --> 06:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
at whatever hearings we have here we
 
06:32:03.170 --> 06:32:03.180 align:start position:0%
would be able to get information from
 
06:32:04.610 --> 06:32:04.620 align:start position:0%
the appropriate people to answer our
 
06:32:05.868 --> 06:32:05.878 align:start position:0%
questions about things that are as
 
06:32:08.030 --> 06:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
complicated to this thank you thank you
 
06:32:10.070 --> 06:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
representative Newman so uh before
 
06:32:12.230 --> 06:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
chairman Roy left for this afternoon he
 
06:32:14.330 --> 06:32:14.340 align:start position:0%
did tell me that if this got to be as
 
06:32:17.510 --> 06:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
interesting as it did that he certainly
 
06:32:19.788 --> 06:32:19.798 align:start position:0%
would be be willing to create a
 
06:32:21.890 --> 06:32:21.900 align:start position:0%
subcommittee I do not feel that I'm the
 
06:32:23.750 --> 06:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
best person to say who those members are
 
06:32:25.490 --> 06:32:25.500 align:start position:0%
going to be so when we all meet back
 
06:32:27.548 --> 06:32:27.558 align:start position:0%
here tomorrow morning at 9 30
 
06:32:29.810 --> 06:32:29.820 align:start position:0%
I will ask him if we can just address
 
06:32:32.090 --> 06:32:32.100 align:start position:0%
this quickly so that we're all here and
 
06:32:33.948 --> 06:32:33.958 align:start position:0%
I'm sure at that time people will point
 
06:32:36.350 --> 06:32:36.360 align:start position:0%
one and we will be in contact with the
 
06:32:37.670 --> 06:32:37.680 align:start position:0%
stakeholders to be sure that you guys
 
06:32:39.170 --> 06:32:39.180 align:start position:0%
are invited to any kind of work sessions
 
06:32:41.090 --> 06:32:41.100 align:start position:0%
that happen with that thank you very
 
06:32:43.010 --> 06:32:43.020 align:start position:0%
much thank you is there anybody that
 
06:32:45.410 --> 06:32:45.420 align:start position:0%
wishes to testify on this bill that has
 
06:32:47.810 --> 06:32:47.820 align:start position:0%
not turned in a pink card
 
06:32:49.548 --> 06:32:49.558 align:start position:0%
seeing none to close the public hearing
 
06:32:51.890 --> 06:32:51.900 align:start position:0%
for house bill
 
06:32:53.510 --> 06:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
where are we at
 
06:32:56.570 --> 06:32:56.580 align:start position:0%
um 593 and we will open the public
 
06:33:05.208 --> 06:33:05.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:07.250 --> 06:33:07.260 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
06:33:50.690 --> 06:33:50.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:50.700 --> 06:33:54.650 align:start position:0%
 
so

06:33:54.650 --> 06:33:54.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:56.270 --> 06:33:56.280 align:start position:0%
um Hello I'm
 
06:34:00.230 --> 06:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
Eric Gallagher the representative from
 
06:34:03.230 --> 06:34:03.240 align:start position:0%
Concord Ward 6 which is Merrimack County
 
06:34:05.448 --> 06:34:05.458 align:start position:0%
District 20.
 
06:34:08.590 --> 06:34:08.600 align:start position:0%
I'm here to introduce House Bill
 
06:34:11.990 --> 06:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
589 prohibiting state and local law
 
06:34:14.030 --> 06:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement from participating
 
06:34:16.610 --> 06:34:16.620 align:start position:0%
in the enforcement of copyright claims
 
06:34:18.288 --> 06:34:18.298 align:start position:0%
against free and open source software
 
06:34:21.770 --> 06:34:21.780 align:start position:0%
projects so um
 
06:34:24.048 --> 06:34:24.058 align:start position:0%
one of my
 
06:34:27.548 --> 06:34:27.558 align:start position:0%
one of my top issues is software Freedom
 
06:34:31.548 --> 06:34:31.558 align:start position:0%
the freedom basically to
 
06:34:34.128 --> 06:34:34.138 align:start position:0%
use computers the way you want to
 
06:34:37.128 --> 06:34:37.138 align:start position:0%
without being controlled by
 
06:34:40.128 --> 06:34:40.138 align:start position:0%
governments or large corporations
 
06:34:44.270 --> 06:34:44.280 align:start position:0%
um so um I say software freedom because
 
06:34:46.368 --> 06:34:46.378 align:start position:0%
if I say free software you might think
 
06:34:48.110 --> 06:34:48.120 align:start position:0%
it's just a matter of price but it's
 
06:34:53.868 --> 06:34:53.878 align:start position:0%
free Us in Freedom as in a matter of
 
06:34:57.048 --> 06:34:57.058 align:start position:0%
being able to do with it as you wish
 
06:34:57.058 --> 06:34:58.150 align:start position:0%
being able to do with it as you wish
um

06:34:58.150 --> 06:34:58.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:35:02.330 --> 06:35:02.340 align:start position:0%
in other languages that's the uh it
 
06:35:05.150 --> 06:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
would be free would be translated as
 
06:35:07.910 --> 06:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
Libre rather than gratis
 
06:35:10.788 --> 06:35:10.798 align:start position:0%
so last term I had
 
06:35:14.750 --> 06:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
a bill the securing our freedom to write
 
06:35:17.288 --> 06:35:17.298 align:start position:0%
and read everything or software act
 
06:35:21.470 --> 06:35:21.480 align:start position:0%
which was a big Omnibus that contained a
 
06:35:23.208 --> 06:35:23.218 align:start position:0%
lot of different things
 
06:35:25.490 --> 06:35:25.500 align:start position:0%
I wanted to do to print out software
 
06:35:25.500 --> 06:35:26.868 align:start position:0%
I wanted to do to print out software
Freedom

06:35:26.868 --> 06:35:26.878 align:start position:0%
Freedom
 
06:35:26.878 --> 06:35:27.650 align:start position:0%
Freedom
um

06:35:27.650 --> 06:35:27.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:35:29.990 --> 06:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
since it was an Omnibus it went before
 
06:35:30.000 --> 06:35:31.730 align:start position:0%
since it was an Omnibus it went before
Edna

06:35:31.730 --> 06:35:31.740 align:start position:0%
Edna
 
06:35:33.650 --> 06:35:33.660 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
06:35:36.288 --> 06:35:36.298 align:start position:0%
their feedback was that I was trying to
 
06:35:39.530 --> 06:35:39.540 align:start position:0%
do too much in a single Bill and
 
06:35:42.110 --> 06:35:42.120 align:start position:0%
recommended that I
 
06:35:46.548 --> 06:35:46.558 align:start position:0%
split it up into separate bills to try
 
06:35:49.070 --> 06:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
again this term so that's what I'm doing
 
06:35:49.080 --> 06:35:49.910 align:start position:0%
again this term so that's what I'm doing
um

06:35:49.910 --> 06:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:35:52.548 --> 06:35:52.558 align:start position:0%
so most of the
 
06:35:55.430 --> 06:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
uh most of the bills
 
06:35:58.330 --> 06:35:58.340 align:start position:0%
that it got split up into
 
06:36:01.970 --> 06:36:01.980 align:start position:0%
went before Edna again but a few went to
 
06:36:03.770 --> 06:36:03.780 align:start position:0%
different commands like this one is the
 
06:36:05.330 --> 06:36:05.340 align:start position:0%
criminal justice part and then there was
 
06:36:07.970 --> 06:36:07.980 align:start position:0%
also another part that went to Judiciary
 
06:36:07.980 --> 06:36:09.708 align:start position:0%
also another part that went to Judiciary
so

06:36:09.708 --> 06:36:09.718 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:36:09.718 --> 06:36:10.610 align:start position:0%
so
um

06:36:10.610 --> 06:36:10.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:36:12.948 --> 06:36:12.958 align:start position:0%
this part is
 
06:36:12.958 --> 06:36:13.850 align:start position:0%
this part is
um

06:36:13.850 --> 06:36:13.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:36:13.860 --> 06:36:16.430 align:start position:0%
um
specifically

06:36:16.430 --> 06:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
06:36:18.288 --> 06:36:18.298 align:start position:0%
yeah this part is like the one small
 
06:36:20.930 --> 06:36:20.940 align:start position:0%
part of it that intersects with criminal
 
06:36:20.940 --> 06:36:22.070 align:start position:0%
part of it that intersects with criminal
justice

06:36:22.070 --> 06:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
justice
 
06:36:22.080 --> 06:36:22.670 align:start position:0%
justice
um

06:36:22.670 --> 06:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:36:25.730 --> 06:36:25.740 align:start position:0%
one of the issues that it came across
 
06:36:25.740 --> 06:36:27.890 align:start position:0%
one of the issues that it came across
when

06:36:27.890 --> 06:36:27.900 align:start position:0%
when
 
06:36:30.410 --> 06:36:30.420 align:start position:0%
um trying to think about how to protect
 
06:36:36.288 --> 06:36:36.298 align:start position:0%
software freedom is that a lot of
 
06:36:38.868 --> 06:36:38.878 align:start position:0%
a lot of the law relevant to it is
 
06:36:42.230 --> 06:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
actually Federal level legislation and
 
06:36:44.930 --> 06:36:44.940 align:start position:0%
there's not really much
 
06:36:48.708 --> 06:36:48.718 align:start position:0%
that we can do about that at the state
 
06:36:50.570 --> 06:36:50.580 align:start position:0%
level but
 
06:36:53.570 --> 06:36:53.580 align:start position:0%
um we have had other bills
 
06:36:53.580 --> 06:36:55.368 align:start position:0%
um we have had other bills
previously

06:36:55.368 --> 06:36:55.378 align:start position:0%
previously
 
06:36:57.890 --> 06:36:57.900 align:start position:0%
to um
 
06:37:01.190 --> 06:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
express our state level opinion on
 
06:37:04.670 --> 06:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
federal laws so for example
 
06:37:08.570 --> 06:37:08.580 align:start position:0%
um we had if you're on the right think
 
06:37:11.410 --> 06:37:11.420 align:start position:0%
of this like the
 
06:37:13.570 --> 06:37:13.580 align:start position:0%
bills to
 
06:37:16.788 --> 06:37:16.798 align:start position:0%
prevent law enforcement from helping to
 
06:37:16.798 --> 06:37:18.250 align:start position:0%
prevent law enforcement from helping to
enforce

06:37:18.250 --> 06:37:18.260 align:start position:0%
enforce
 
06:37:20.990 --> 06:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
firearm executive orders or if you're on
 
06:37:23.868 --> 06:37:23.878 align:start position:0%
the left think of this more like a
 
06:37:23.878 --> 06:37:25.730 align:start position:0%
the left think of this more like a
sanctuary

06:37:25.730 --> 06:37:25.740 align:start position:0%
sanctuary
 
06:37:27.770 --> 06:37:27.780 align:start position:0%
City type
 
06:37:31.670 --> 06:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:34.910 --> 06:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
in this case it's specifically for uh
 
06:37:37.010 --> 06:37:37.020 align:start position:0%
developers of
 
06:37:39.890 --> 06:37:39.900 align:start position:0%
free and open source software so
 
06:37:42.490 --> 06:37:42.500 align:start position:0%
a lot of the times
 
06:37:47.270 --> 06:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
one of the big barriers to contributing
 
06:37:49.190 --> 06:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
so these are
 
06:37:51.470 --> 06:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
these are software projects that are in
 
06:37:54.230 --> 06:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
the public interest that everyone
 
06:37:57.170 --> 06:37:57.180 align:start position:0%
benefits from so like some of the big
 
06:37:58.970 --> 06:37:58.980 align:start position:0%
ones uh
 
06:38:04.548 --> 06:38:04.558 align:start position:0%
would be Linux or Firefox or Wikipedia
 
06:38:06.410 --> 06:38:06.420 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that makes
 
06:38:11.030 --> 06:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
developers reluctant to contribute to um
 
06:38:14.750 --> 06:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
these sometimes is just fear of
 
06:38:18.470 --> 06:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
persecution from the uh
 
06:38:22.430 --> 06:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
big tech companies that might come after
 
06:38:22.440 --> 06:38:23.750 align:start position:0%
big tech companies that might come after
them

06:38:23.750 --> 06:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
them
 
06:38:23.760 --> 06:38:24.830 align:start position:0%
them
um

06:38:24.830 --> 06:38:24.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:38:24.840 --> 06:38:26.390 align:start position:0%
um
so

06:38:26.390 --> 06:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:38:28.548 --> 06:38:28.558 align:start position:0%
this bill is
 
06:38:31.368 --> 06:38:31.378 align:start position:0%
just kind of a way of sending a message
 
06:38:34.788 --> 06:38:34.798 align:start position:0%
to those developers that
 
06:38:37.730 --> 06:38:37.740 align:start position:0%
well okay New Hampshire is
 
06:38:40.548 --> 06:38:40.558 align:start position:0%
a safe place for you to contribute from
 
06:38:43.670 --> 06:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
without having to worry about big Tech
 
06:38:45.410 --> 06:38:45.420 align:start position:0%
um coming after you I know there's been
 
06:38:47.510 --> 06:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of frustration with big Tech on
 
06:38:49.548 --> 06:38:49.558 align:start position:0%
both sides of the aisle
 
06:38:51.590 --> 06:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
um you know on the left it's more just
 
06:38:55.310 --> 06:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
for being big on the right it's for
 
06:38:58.310 --> 06:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
claims of censorship or whatever so I
 
06:38:58.320 --> 06:38:59.390 align:start position:0%
claims of censorship or whatever so I
think

06:38:59.390 --> 06:38:59.400 align:start position:0%
think
 
06:38:59.400 --> 06:39:00.170 align:start position:0%
think
um

06:39:00.170 --> 06:39:00.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:39:05.390 --> 06:39:05.400 align:start position:0%
this bill could be a good way to uh
 
06:39:05.400 --> 06:39:06.590 align:start position:0%
this bill could be a good way to uh
send

06:39:06.590 --> 06:39:06.600 align:start position:0%
send
 
06:39:10.070 --> 06:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
a message to big Tech that we're not
 
06:39:14.270 --> 06:39:14.280 align:start position:0%
going to be helping them anymore so
 
06:39:14.280 --> 06:39:15.048 align:start position:0%
going to be helping them anymore so
um

06:39:15.048 --> 06:39:15.058 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:39:17.330 --> 06:39:17.340 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't actually
 
06:39:20.030 --> 06:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make anything
 
06:39:22.610 --> 06:39:22.620 align:start position:0%
that's currently illegal into something
 
06:39:24.650 --> 06:39:24.660 align:start position:0%
that's legal
 
06:39:26.930 --> 06:39:26.940 align:start position:0%
um it
 
06:39:30.048 --> 06:39:30.058 align:start position:0%
um so it violating copyright would still
 
06:39:31.610 --> 06:39:31.620 align:start position:0%
be illegal under this since that's the
 
06:39:35.030 --> 06:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
federal jurisdiction it is just
 
06:39:38.150 --> 06:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
a way of sending a message that we're
 
06:39:39.770 --> 06:39:39.780 align:start position:0%
not going to
 
06:39:43.850 --> 06:39:43.860 align:start position:0%
help the federal government in their job
 
06:39:47.208 --> 06:39:47.218 align:start position:0%
of Prosecuting it
 
06:39:47.218 --> 06:39:48.288 align:start position:0%
of Prosecuting it
um

06:39:48.288 --> 06:39:48.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:39:48.298 --> 06:39:50.330 align:start position:0%
um
so

06:39:50.330 --> 06:39:50.340 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:39:53.448 --> 06:39:53.458 align:start position:0%
yeah looking at the fiscal note
 
06:39:53.458 --> 06:39:54.650 align:start position:0%
yeah looking at the fiscal note
um

06:39:54.650 --> 06:39:54.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:39:54.660 --> 06:39:56.270 align:start position:0%
um
so

06:39:56.270 --> 06:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:39:58.910 --> 06:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
the municipal Association the
 
06:40:01.490 --> 06:40:01.500 align:start position:0%
association of County said that local
 
06:40:03.288 --> 06:40:03.298 align:start position:0%
law enforcement doesn't do that any
 
06:40:06.410 --> 06:40:06.420 align:start position:0%
anyways so you could
 
06:40:08.330 --> 06:40:08.340 align:start position:0%
you could could hear that and think okay
 
06:40:11.270 --> 06:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
well why do we need this then
 
06:40:13.850 --> 06:40:13.860 align:start position:0%
well I think even if it doesn't
 
06:40:16.490 --> 06:40:16.500 align:start position:0%
necessarily have a practical impact I
 
06:40:19.610 --> 06:40:19.620 align:start position:0%
still think it's worth passing just to
 
06:40:22.190 --> 06:40:22.200 align:start position:0%
send a symbolic
 
06:40:24.650 --> 06:40:24.660 align:start position:0%
message that
 
06:40:24.660 --> 06:40:25.250 align:start position:0%
message that
um

06:40:25.250 --> 06:40:25.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:40:26.830 --> 06:40:26.840 align:start position:0%
we support
 
06:40:29.390 --> 06:40:29.400 align:start position:0%
developers of free and open source
 
06:40:32.510 --> 06:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
software and that they should
 
06:40:36.230 --> 06:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
feel welcome to come here and contribute
 
06:40:37.850 --> 06:40:37.860 align:start position:0%
to free and open source software
 
06:40:40.430 --> 06:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
projects from here without having to
 
06:40:42.350 --> 06:40:42.360 align:start position:0%
worry about big tech companies coming
 
06:40:44.390 --> 06:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
after them
 
06:40:44.400 --> 06:40:45.590 align:start position:0%
after them
um

06:40:45.590 --> 06:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:40:45.600 --> 06:40:46.850 align:start position:0%
um
so

06:40:46.850 --> 06:40:46.860 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:40:49.430 --> 06:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
yeah it's a
 
06:40:49.440 --> 06:40:50.390 align:start position:0%
yeah it's a
um

06:40:50.390 --> 06:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:40:52.310 --> 06:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
yeah one other term
 
06:40:52.320 --> 06:40:53.570 align:start position:0%
yeah one other term
um

06:40:53.570 --> 06:40:53.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:40:56.868 --> 06:40:56.878 align:start position:0%
so yeah I guess I um
 
06:40:59.330 --> 06:40:59.340 align:start position:0%
representative could you just in like
 
06:41:01.850 --> 06:41:01.860 align:start position:0%
one sentence sum up what exactly what
 
06:41:04.368 --> 06:41:04.378 align:start position:0%
this bill does for us please so
 
06:41:07.368 --> 06:41:07.378 align:start position:0%
um yeah it just says no no member of law
 
06:41:08.570 --> 06:41:08.580 align:start position:0%
enforcement in the state of New
 
06:41:09.830 --> 06:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or any of his political
 
06:41:11.930 --> 06:41:11.940 align:start position:0%
subdivisions to assist federal law
 
06:41:14.510 --> 06:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement and any investigation or
 
06:41:16.730 --> 06:41:16.740 align:start position:0%
prosecution of copyright claims or other
 
06:41:18.830 --> 06:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
claims of intellectual property crimes
 
06:41:20.750 --> 06:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
brought by makers of proprietary
 
06:41:22.850 --> 06:41:22.860 align:start position:0%
software against makers of competing
 
06:41:25.548 --> 06:41:25.558 align:start position:0%
free and open source software projects
 
06:41:25.558 --> 06:41:26.930 align:start position:0%
free and open source software projects
so

06:41:26.930 --> 06:41:26.940 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:41:29.330 --> 06:41:29.340 align:start position:0%
um free software often defines itself in
 
06:41:32.930 --> 06:41:32.940 align:start position:0%
opposition to proprietary software which
 
06:41:32.940 --> 06:41:33.590 align:start position:0%
opposition to proprietary software which
is

06:41:33.590 --> 06:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:41:37.850 --> 06:41:37.860 align:start position:0%
ones where um the big tech companies uh
 
06:41:40.128 --> 06:41:40.138 align:start position:0%
claim IPO over it
 
06:41:43.128 --> 06:41:43.138 align:start position:0%
um so
 
06:41:43.138 --> 06:41:44.270 align:start position:0%
um so
um

06:41:44.270 --> 06:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:41:47.570 --> 06:41:47.580 align:start position:0%
basically it's it's saying like if you
 
06:41:52.250 --> 06:41:52.260 align:start position:0%
want to contribute to Libra office then
 
06:41:55.430 --> 06:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
um and you want to contribute to it from
 
06:41:59.208 --> 06:41:59.218 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and Microsoft wants to
 
06:42:00.948 --> 06:42:00.958 align:start position:0%
come after you because they think you're
 
06:42:05.270 --> 06:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
violating their IP then New Hampshire is
 
06:42:08.690 --> 06:42:08.700 align:start position:0%
not going to help Microsoft in that case
 
06:42:12.170 --> 06:42:12.180 align:start position:0%
that's basically just it's going to be
 
06:42:13.730 --> 06:42:13.740 align:start position:0%
up to Microsoft and the federal
 
06:42:15.590 --> 06:42:15.600 align:start position:0%
government to
 
06:42:18.590 --> 06:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
pursue those claims on their own
 
06:42:20.750 --> 06:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
um so yeah that's the bill and I'll take
 
06:42:24.530 --> 06:42:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:27.708 --> 06:42:27.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:29.750 --> 06:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
06:42:32.448 --> 06:42:32.458 align:start position:0%
taking my question so just to clarify
 
06:42:33.770 --> 06:42:33.780 align:start position:0%
essentially what we're saying is that
 
06:42:36.070 --> 06:42:36.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is not going to help
 
06:42:39.948 --> 06:42:39.958 align:start position:0%
what is essentially weaponizing uh our
 
06:42:43.430 --> 06:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
our law enforcement against smaller
 
06:42:44.390 --> 06:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
companies that are considered
 
06:42:47.690 --> 06:42:47.700 align:start position:0%
competition for larger companies or well
 
06:42:49.850 --> 06:42:49.860 align:start position:0%
yeah they could be companies
 
06:42:52.070 --> 06:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
um or they could just be hobbyists
 
06:42:52.080 --> 06:42:53.628 align:start position:0%
um or they could just be hobbyists
people

06:42:53.628 --> 06:42:53.638 align:start position:0%
people
 
06:42:55.670 --> 06:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
um contributing to these projects in
 
06:42:57.430 --> 06:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
their spare time or
 
06:42:59.270 --> 06:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
non-profits or
 
06:43:07.368 --> 06:43:07.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:10.010 --> 06:43:10.020 align:start position:0%
representative Muse
 
06:43:12.410 --> 06:43:12.420 align:start position:0%
since the the software projects you're
 
06:43:14.810 --> 06:43:14.820 align:start position:0%
talking about are free and open source
 
06:43:16.850 --> 06:43:16.860 align:start position:0%
one of the things I'm curious about is
 
06:43:20.750 --> 06:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
how often is copyright an issue with
 
06:43:23.448 --> 06:43:23.458 align:start position:0%
open source software projects I thought
 
06:43:26.448 --> 06:43:26.458 align:start position:0%
the whole idea of Open Source was open
 
06:43:26.458 --> 06:43:27.590 align:start position:0%
the whole idea of Open Source was open
source

06:43:27.590 --> 06:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
source
 
06:43:29.570 --> 06:43:29.580 align:start position:0%
well yes
 
06:43:31.490 --> 06:43:31.500 align:start position:0%
um so
 
06:43:31.500 --> 06:43:33.288 align:start position:0%
um so
um

06:43:33.288 --> 06:43:33.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:43:36.110 --> 06:43:36.120 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
06:43:39.110 --> 06:43:39.120 align:start position:0%
a project can be
 
06:43:42.590 --> 06:43:42.600 align:start position:0%
um open source and also have its own
 
06:43:42.600 --> 06:43:43.670 align:start position:0%
um open source and also have its own
um

06:43:46.430 --> 06:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:43:46.440 --> 06:43:48.048 align:start position:0%
um
saying

06:43:48.048 --> 06:43:48.058 align:start position:0%
saying
 
06:43:50.690 --> 06:43:50.700 align:start position:0%
how specifically you're allowed to copy
 
06:43:52.970 --> 06:43:52.980 align:start position:0%
it um there's this form of copyright
 
06:43:56.208 --> 06:43:56.218 align:start position:0%
called copy left for example where it
 
06:43:58.010 --> 06:43:58.020 align:start position:0%
says basically if you're going to copy
 
06:44:00.830 --> 06:44:00.840 align:start position:0%
it you have to let anyone else
 
06:44:03.110 --> 06:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
have the same
 
06:44:08.208 --> 06:44:08.218 align:start position:0%
rights as you're granting them
 
06:44:10.730 --> 06:44:10.740 align:start position:0%
so yeah oftentimes
 
06:44:10.740 --> 06:44:12.288 align:start position:0%
so yeah oftentimes
oftentimes

06:44:12.288 --> 06:44:12.298 align:start position:0%
oftentimes
 
06:44:12.298 --> 06:44:13.070 align:start position:0%
oftentimes
um

06:44:13.070 --> 06:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:44:15.590 --> 06:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
where it comes into effect in affecting
 
06:44:19.670 --> 06:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
these contributions uh is just
 
06:44:22.250 --> 06:44:22.260 align:start position:0%
influencing developer Behavior as to
 
06:44:24.650 --> 06:44:24.660 align:start position:0%
whether they want to contribute or not
 
06:44:26.208 --> 06:44:26.218 align:start position:0%
in the first place
 
06:44:29.390 --> 06:44:29.400 align:start position:0%
um oftentimes developers will just be
 
06:44:29.400 --> 06:44:30.770 align:start position:0%
um oftentimes developers will just be
afraid

06:44:30.770 --> 06:44:30.780 align:start position:0%
afraid
 
06:44:33.470 --> 06:44:33.480 align:start position:0%
to contribute um
 
06:44:36.890 --> 06:44:36.900 align:start position:0%
because of proprietary software
 
06:44:36.900 --> 06:44:38.330 align:start position:0%
because of proprietary software
companies

06:44:38.330 --> 06:44:38.340 align:start position:0%
companies
 
06:44:38.340 --> 06:44:39.170 align:start position:0%
companies
um

06:44:39.170 --> 06:44:39.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:44:42.048 --> 06:44:42.058 align:start position:0%
like I've seen developers say oh yeah
 
06:44:43.970 --> 06:44:43.980 align:start position:0%
I'd love to fix this bug but I can't
 
06:44:47.930 --> 06:44:47.940 align:start position:0%
because I've seen the source code of
 
06:44:49.190 --> 06:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
um this
 
06:44:51.948 --> 06:44:51.958 align:start position:0%
com this other competing product
 
06:44:55.430 --> 06:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
um so yeah um
 
06:44:56.810 --> 06:44:56.820 align:start position:0%
yeah it kind of ties in with
 
06:44:58.850 --> 06:44:58.860 align:start position:0%
non-competes a bit one of my other parts
 
06:45:00.830 --> 06:45:00.840 align:start position:0%
of one of the other bills that this was
 
06:45:03.548 --> 06:45:03.558 align:start position:0%
broken up into was to
 
06:45:06.288 --> 06:45:06.298 align:start position:0%
focus specifically on the interaction of
 
06:45:06.298 --> 06:45:07.610 align:start position:0%
focus specifically on the interaction of
non-competes

06:45:07.610 --> 06:45:07.620 align:start position:0%
non-competes
 
06:45:10.190 --> 06:45:10.200 align:start position:0%
with free software but um that's a
 
06:45:11.570 --> 06:45:11.580 align:start position:0%
separate bill so
 
06:45:15.708 --> 06:45:15.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:17.930 --> 06:45:17.940 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
06:45:30.830 --> 06:45:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:32.270 --> 06:45:32.280 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Jeff Charles
 
06:45:33.830 --> 06:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
and I'm associate attorney general's New
 
06:45:36.470 --> 06:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Attorney General's office
 
06:45:37.970 --> 06:45:37.980 align:start position:0%
I'm here to answer any questions you
 
06:45:39.590 --> 06:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
have about this but also to oppose the
 
06:45:42.048 --> 06:45:42.058 align:start position:0%
bill and I'll explain why
 
06:45:43.850 --> 06:45:43.860 align:start position:0%
um we pose a bill because of the
 
06:45:45.948 --> 06:45:45.958 align:start position:0%
collateral consequences that will that
 
06:45:48.470 --> 06:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
will stem from this bill and it starts
 
06:45:50.030 --> 06:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
with the understanding that
 
06:45:52.548 --> 06:45:52.558 align:start position:0%
you know the term big Tech was used big
 
06:45:55.368 --> 06:45:55.378 align:start position:0%
Tech doesn't prosecute cases or as the
 
06:45:57.410 --> 06:45:57.420 align:start position:0%
bill says I think at one point bring
 
06:45:57.420 --> 06:45:58.788 align:start position:0%
bill says I think at one point bring
crimes

06:45:58.788 --> 06:45:58.798 align:start position:0%
crimes
 
06:46:01.430 --> 06:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
crimes are charged and investigated by
 
06:46:03.350 --> 06:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
law enforcement agencies and prosecutors
 
06:46:05.868 --> 06:46:05.878 align:start position:0%
they're the only arm in our state and
 
06:46:07.430 --> 06:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
federal government that can bring
 
06:46:10.390 --> 06:46:10.400 align:start position:0%
criminal actions and so this bill is
 
06:46:13.070 --> 06:46:13.080 align:start position:0%
targeted at the actions of federal law
 
06:46:14.650 --> 06:46:14.660 align:start position:0%
enforcement authorities in New Hampshire
 
06:46:17.510 --> 06:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
and because it's so Broad in its
 
06:46:19.670 --> 06:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
parameters it would mean that if federal
 
06:46:21.948 --> 06:46:21.958 align:start position:0%
law enforcement authorities were to come
 
06:46:24.170 --> 06:46:24.180 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire and investigate one of
 
06:46:25.910 --> 06:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
these cases try to execute a search
 
06:46:28.310 --> 06:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
warrant or an arrest warrant that local
 
06:46:29.628 --> 06:46:29.638 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire authorities could not
 
06:46:32.090 --> 06:46:32.100 align:start position:0%
participate in any way shape or form to
 
06:46:33.830 --> 06:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
do the most basic things they do with
 
06:46:35.750 --> 06:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
regards to safety whenever another law
 
06:46:37.128 --> 06:46:37.138 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency comes into New
 
06:46:39.350 --> 06:46:39.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire which is they would coordinate
 
06:46:41.448 --> 06:46:41.458 align:start position:0%
with that agency just to provide basic
 
06:46:44.810 --> 06:46:44.820 align:start position:0%
safety like traffic control
 
06:46:44.820 --> 06:46:45.708 align:start position:0%
safety like traffic control
um

06:46:45.708 --> 06:46:45.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:46:47.930 --> 06:46:47.940 align:start position:0%
to help them in case somebody were to
 
06:46:49.850 --> 06:46:49.860 align:start position:0%
try to escape or commit other crimes in
 
06:46:51.230 --> 06:46:51.240 align:start position:0%
this process so essentially this would
 
06:46:53.390 --> 06:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
say that Federal authorities could come
 
06:46:54.708 --> 06:46:54.718 align:start position:0%
into New Hampshire would not have to
 
06:46:55.910 --> 06:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
coordinate at all with New Hampshire
 
06:46:58.010 --> 06:46:58.020 align:start position:0%
authorities essentially not even give
 
06:46:59.690 --> 06:46:59.700 align:start position:0%
them notice because that might violate
 
06:47:02.868 --> 06:47:02.878 align:start position:0%
this provision of assisting and would
 
06:47:04.968 --> 06:47:04.978 align:start position:0%
would not have any idea and suddenly get
 
06:47:07.030 --> 06:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
a phone call that there's you know
 
06:47:11.510 --> 06:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
Men In Black SUVs breaking into a home
 
06:47:11.520 --> 06:47:13.128 align:start position:0%
Men In Black SUVs breaking into a home
and

06:47:13.128 --> 06:47:13.138 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:47:14.990 --> 06:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
and then obviously the locals would go
 
06:47:16.968 --> 06:47:16.978 align:start position:0%
there and who knows what could happen in
 
06:47:19.490 --> 06:47:19.500 align:start position:0%
that situation so normally when one
 
06:47:21.288 --> 06:47:21.298 align:start position:0%
agency whether it's federal or state or
 
06:47:23.090 --> 06:47:23.100 align:start position:0%
local goes into another jurisdiction New
 
06:47:25.610 --> 06:47:25.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that agency gives that local
 
06:47:27.468 --> 06:47:27.478 align:start position:0%
agency a heads up
 
06:47:29.090 --> 06:47:29.100 align:start position:0%
um they often coordinate with them and
 
06:47:30.708 --> 06:47:30.718 align:start position:0%
they may have to again assist them with
 
06:47:32.510 --> 06:47:32.520 align:start position:0%
basic Public Safety things just like
 
06:47:34.910 --> 06:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
crowd control and scene control and this
 
06:47:37.850 --> 06:47:37.860 align:start position:0%
bill would prohibit that completely and
 
06:47:39.590 --> 06:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
so we just want to bring that to your
 
06:47:41.030 --> 06:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
attention that it actually would create
 
06:47:43.968 --> 06:47:43.978 align:start position:0%
potential public safety issues because
 
06:47:47.090 --> 06:47:47.100 align:start position:0%
of it's such a broad reach and again the
 
06:47:48.948 --> 06:47:48.958 align:start position:0%
bill talks about
 
06:47:51.830 --> 06:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
uses the term intellectual property
 
06:47:54.410 --> 06:47:54.420 align:start position:0%
crimes brought by makers a proprietary
 
06:47:54.420 --> 06:47:55.910 align:start position:0%
crimes brought by makers a proprietary
software

06:47:55.910 --> 06:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
software
 
06:47:57.948 --> 06:47:57.958 align:start position:0%
private citizens can't bring criminal
 
06:48:00.170 --> 06:48:00.180 align:start position:0%
actions like this it has to be brought
 
06:48:02.628 --> 06:48:02.638 align:start position:0%
by a law enforcement agency or or a
 
06:48:03.708 --> 06:48:03.718 align:start position:0%
prosecutor they can certainly make
 
06:48:05.208 --> 06:48:05.218 align:start position:0%
complaints that hey somebody's doing
 
06:48:07.730 --> 06:48:07.740 align:start position:0%
something and that may violate the law
 
06:48:09.230 --> 06:48:09.240 align:start position:0%
but private companies can't bring
 
06:48:12.170 --> 06:48:12.180 align:start position:0%
criminal actions so not sure that this
 
06:48:14.150 --> 06:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
bill sends the message that it's
 
06:48:15.890 --> 06:48:15.900 align:start position:0%
intended to send but it definitely would
 
06:48:18.110 --> 06:48:18.120 align:start position:0%
have collateral consequences against New
 
06:48:19.990 --> 06:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law enforcement agencies state
 
06:48:22.490 --> 06:48:22.500 align:start position:0%
and local and their ability just to do
 
06:48:24.170 --> 06:48:24.180 align:start position:0%
the basic things they would need to do
 
06:48:27.410 --> 06:48:27.420 align:start position:0%
to assist another agency here even if it
 
06:48:29.390 --> 06:48:29.400 align:start position:0%
wasn't something we agreed with again we
 
06:48:31.070 --> 06:48:31.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want our folks just to not get
 
06:48:32.690 --> 06:48:32.700 align:start position:0%
noticed and not be able to participate
 
06:48:34.548 --> 06:48:34.558 align:start position:0%
if something goes sideways that's their
 
06:48:34.558 --> 06:48:36.708 align:start position:0%
if something goes sideways that's their
job

06:48:36.708 --> 06:48:36.718 align:start position:0%
job
 
06:48:37.968 --> 06:48:37.978 align:start position:0%
and that's all those are all the
 
06:48:39.170 --> 06:48:39.180 align:start position:0%
comments I have I'm happy to answer
 
06:48:39.180 --> 06:48:43.070 align:start position:0%
comments I have I'm happy to answer
questions

06:48:43.070 --> 06:48:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:45.948 --> 06:48:45.958 align:start position:0%
do you have any comment on we have a lot
 
06:48:47.750 --> 06:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
of bills this session it seems like
 
06:48:49.548 --> 06:48:49.558 align:start position:0%
where the state of New Hampshire shall
 
06:48:49.558 --> 06:48:50.448 align:start position:0%
where the state of New Hampshire shall
not

06:48:50.448 --> 06:48:50.458 align:start position:0%
not
 
06:48:53.510 --> 06:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
use any funds to assist federal law
 
06:48:56.930 --> 06:48:56.940 align:start position:0%
enforcement to do X Y or Z is this
 
06:48:58.788 --> 06:48:58.798 align:start position:0%
similar to that is this different than
 
06:49:00.410 --> 06:49:00.420 align:start position:0%
those kind of laws that we that we're
 
06:49:02.510 --> 06:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
going to be seeing this year this is
 
06:49:04.490 --> 06:49:04.500 align:start position:0%
this is different because it's not
 
06:49:07.190 --> 06:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
directed at funds directly I guess maybe
 
06:49:08.810 --> 06:49:08.820 align:start position:0%
indirectly it is because you're saying
 
06:49:10.610 --> 06:49:10.620 align:start position:0%
law enforcement can't do certain things
 
06:49:12.590 --> 06:49:12.600 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire so maybe indirectly it
 
06:49:14.690 --> 06:49:14.700 align:start position:0%
is this bill is actually more focused
 
06:49:16.548 --> 06:49:16.558 align:start position:0%
and then it says you know what it says
 
06:49:19.310 --> 06:49:19.320 align:start position:0%
is you know about you know no member of
 
06:49:20.628 --> 06:49:20.638 align:start position:0%
law enforcement in the state of New
 
06:49:22.850 --> 06:49:22.860 align:start position:0%
Hampshire shall assist and again that
 
06:49:26.208 --> 06:49:26.218 align:start position:0%
word assist is very very broad so at
 
06:49:28.490 --> 06:49:28.500 align:start position:0%
least in this context it's because the
 
06:49:31.430 --> 06:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
limitation is so Broad and again
 
06:49:33.350 --> 06:49:33.360 align:start position:0%
just the way that law enforcement Works
 
06:49:34.850 --> 06:49:34.860 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire where if somebody goes
 
06:49:36.708 --> 06:49:36.718 align:start position:0%
someone else's jurisdiction you get
 
06:49:38.750 --> 06:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
noticed you assist them and it wouldn't
 
06:49:40.430 --> 06:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
be hey help us with the search warrant
 
06:49:41.810 --> 06:49:41.820 align:start position:0%
it's just like hey can you make sure
 
06:49:43.670 --> 06:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
that a bunch of people don't come on the
 
06:49:45.170 --> 06:49:45.180 align:start position:0%
property or if somebody tries to escape
 
06:49:47.570 --> 06:49:47.580 align:start position:0%
you can block that road off basic things
 
06:49:49.128 --> 06:49:49.138 align:start position:0%
like that that they would not be able to
 
06:49:50.270 --> 06:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
do here so it's a little bit different
 
06:49:52.610 --> 06:49:52.620 align:start position:0%
than those bills maybe some would argue
 
06:49:53.990 --> 06:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
it gets at the same thing but it's a
 
06:49:55.788 --> 06:49:55.798 align:start position:0%
little bit more targeted here
 
06:50:02.270 --> 06:50:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:04.310 --> 06:50:04.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much is there anybody
 
06:50:05.628 --> 06:50:05.638 align:start position:0%
else wishing to testify on this bill
 
06:50:07.250 --> 06:50:07.260 align:start position:0%
that has not turned in a pink card thank
 
06:50:07.260 --> 06:50:08.810 align:start position:0%
that has not turned in a pink card thank

06:50:10.250 --> 06:50:10.260 align:start position:0%
seeing none I will close the public
 
06:50:12.230 --> 06:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
hearing for house bill
 
06:50:22.548 --> 06:50:22.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:29.948 --> 06:50:29.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:32.570 --> 06:50:32.580 align:start position:0%
the committee recognizes representative
 
06:50:34.070 --> 06:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
Siebert if you could just make sure you
 
06:50:35.750 --> 06:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
fill out a pink card after you after
 
06:50:37.070 --> 06:50:37.080 align:start position:0%
done introducing the bill that'd be
 
06:50:38.810 --> 06:50:38.820 align:start position:0%
great yeah that's good thank you thank
 
06:50:47.030 --> 06:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:47.040 --> 06:50:53.448 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:50:53.448 --> 06:50:53.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:56.150 --> 06:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
I forgot it was 30 on
 
06:50:57.948 --> 06:50:57.958 align:start position:0%
it all right thank you
 
06:50:59.510 --> 06:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
um sorry
 
06:51:01.670 --> 06:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
um I just first of all want to thank
 
06:51:03.650 --> 06:51:03.660 align:start position:0%
um all the members of the committee for
 
06:51:05.510 --> 06:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
being here today
 
06:51:07.910 --> 06:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
um to hear the proposed legislation
 
06:51:07.920 --> 06:51:13.310 align:start position:0%
um to hear the proposed legislation
hb624fn

06:51:13.310 --> 06:51:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:13.320 --> 06:51:13.968 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:51:13.968 --> 06:51:13.978 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:51:16.548 --> 06:51:16.558 align:start position:0%
so the first point I want to make is
 
06:51:18.890 --> 06:51:18.900 align:start position:0%
this minimizes the burden of federal
 
06:51:20.750 --> 06:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
immigration checkpoints on New Hampshire
 
06:51:20.760 --> 06:51:22.368 align:start position:0%
immigration checkpoints on New Hampshire
motorists

06:51:22.368 --> 06:51:22.378 align:start position:0%
motorists
 
06:51:24.590 --> 06:51:24.600 align:start position:0%
it would when informed by a federal
 
06:51:27.468 --> 06:51:27.478 align:start position:0%
agency require state county or Municipal
 
06:51:29.930 --> 06:51:29.940 align:start position:0%
law enforcement to provide the public
 
06:51:32.150 --> 06:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
with up to 24 hours notice that a
 
06:51:34.610 --> 06:51:34.620 align:start position:0%
federal agency intends to conduct an
 
06:51:36.830 --> 06:51:36.840 align:start position:0%
immigration checkpoint
 
06:51:40.010 --> 06:51:40.020 align:start position:0%
the notice shall disclose if known the
 
06:51:42.530 --> 06:51:42.540 align:start position:0%
date municipality and geographical area
 
06:51:45.170 --> 06:51:45.180 align:start position:0%
in which the checkpoint will occur
 
06:51:49.190 --> 06:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
in recent years CPP has ramped up
 
06:51:51.948 --> 06:51:51.958 align:start position:0%
temporary interior Border Patrol
 
06:51:53.810 --> 06:51:53.820 align:start position:0%
checkpoints in Northern New England
 
06:51:56.390 --> 06:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
staging at least 10 temporary
 
06:51:58.310 --> 06:51:58.320 align:start position:0%
checkpoints in the interior of New
 
06:52:01.430 --> 06:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from 2017 to 2019.
 
06:52:03.650 --> 06:52:03.660 align:start position:0%
during seven checkpoints in Woodstock
 
06:52:04.910 --> 06:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
06:52:08.330 --> 06:52:08.340 align:start position:0%
CBP agents inspected each vehicle with a
 
06:52:11.628 --> 06:52:11.638 align:start position:0%
canine test with searching for drugs
 
06:52:14.628 --> 06:52:14.638 align:start position:0%
it is essential to note
 
06:52:17.628 --> 06:52:17.638 align:start position:0%
this took place throughout the height of
 
06:52:19.548 --> 06:52:19.558 align:start position:0%
the tourism season including holiday
 
06:52:21.590 --> 06:52:21.600 align:start position:0%
weekends and events that played a
 
06:52:24.530 --> 06:52:24.540 align:start position:0%
critical role in the economy
 
06:52:28.128 --> 06:52:28.138 align:start position:0%
of nearby municipalities and communities
 
06:52:30.468 --> 06:52:30.478 align:start position:0%
these include during Father's Day
 
06:52:34.250 --> 06:52:34.260 align:start position:0%
weekend Memorial Day Weekend along with
 
06:52:37.010 --> 06:52:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:39.170 --> 06:52:39.180 align:start position:0%
the second point I want to make is that
 
06:52:41.330 --> 06:52:41.340 align:start position:0%
this notice helps to minimize the
 
06:52:43.368 --> 06:52:43.378 align:start position:0%
intrusion and negative impact of
 
06:52:46.368 --> 06:52:46.378 align:start position:0%
checkpoints on New Hampshire motorists
 
06:52:48.590 --> 06:52:48.600 align:start position:0%
so during Federal immigration
 
06:52:51.110 --> 06:52:51.120 align:start position:0%
checkpoints federal agents stopped and
 
06:52:53.090 --> 06:52:53.100 align:start position:0%
seize thousands of individuals traveling
 
06:52:55.190 --> 06:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
through New Hampshire's roadways without
 
06:52:57.350 --> 06:52:57.360 align:start position:0%
probable cause a reasonable suspicion
 
06:52:59.810 --> 06:52:59.820 align:start position:0%
that a crime has been committed this
 
06:53:01.548 --> 06:53:01.558 align:start position:0%
legislation would bring immigration
 
06:53:04.010 --> 06:53:04.020 align:start position:0%
checkpoints under similar notice
 
06:53:06.410 --> 06:53:06.420 align:start position:0%
requirements to those already required
 
06:53:08.330 --> 06:53:08.340 align:start position:0%
for sobriety checkpoints
 
06:53:11.208 --> 06:53:11.218 align:start position:0%
under New Hampshire law advance notice
 
06:53:13.850 --> 06:53:13.860 align:start position:0%
is provided for sobriety checkpoints in
 
06:53:15.890 --> 06:53:15.900 align:start position:0%
part two as the Attorney General
 
06:53:17.868 --> 06:53:17.878 align:start position:0%
indicates in
 
06:53:21.230 --> 06:53:21.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law enforcement manual
 
06:53:23.650 --> 06:53:23.660 align:start position:0%
minimize motorist surprise
 
06:53:28.128 --> 06:53:28.138 align:start position:0%
apprehension and inconvenience end quote
 
06:53:30.288 --> 06:53:30.298 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Supreme Court has
 
06:53:32.270 --> 06:53:32.280 align:start position:0%
looked representative Siebert if you
 
06:53:32.280 --> 06:53:33.288 align:start position:0%
looked representative Siebert if you
could

06:53:33.288 --> 06:53:33.298 align:start position:0%
could
 
06:53:35.090 --> 06:53:35.100 align:start position:0%
um you're reading what you just handed
 
06:53:37.010 --> 06:53:37.020 align:start position:0%
out to us yeah right if you could just
 
06:53:38.750 --> 06:53:38.760 align:start position:0%
summarize basically what this says and
 
06:53:40.910 --> 06:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
will we have this to read that oh okay
 
06:53:42.830 --> 06:53:42.840 align:start position:0%
thank you all right well I mean
 
06:53:45.410 --> 06:53:45.420 align:start position:0%
generally that all we're asking for is
 
06:53:49.190 --> 06:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:49.200 --> 06:53:50.990 align:start position:0%
 
so

06:53:50.990 --> 06:53:51.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:53:51.000 --> 06:53:51.948 align:start position:0%
so
um

06:53:51.948 --> 06:53:51.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:53:56.990 --> 06:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
it's an undue burden on the motorists on
 
06:53:59.448 --> 06:53:59.458 align:start position:0%
on the locals as well
 
06:54:02.390 --> 06:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
um tourism here let me sum up the end
 
06:54:02.400 --> 06:54:04.610 align:start position:0%
um tourism here let me sum up the end
part

06:54:04.610 --> 06:54:04.620 align:start position:0%
part
 
06:54:07.548 --> 06:54:07.558 align:start position:0%
is also this legislation mirrors another
 
06:54:09.590 --> 06:54:09.600 align:start position:0%
that overwhelmingly passed in the house
 
06:54:13.330 --> 06:54:13.340 align:start position:0%
and I strongly urge you to support
 
06:54:16.128 --> 06:54:16.138 align:start position:0%
hb624fn to help minimize the burden for
 
06:54:17.930 --> 06:54:17.940 align:start position:0%
all New Hampshire motorists and Aid in
 
06:54:20.750 --> 06:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
the recovery of our Statewide tourism
 
06:54:26.628 --> 06:54:26.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:29.330 --> 06:54:29.340 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
06:54:33.708 --> 06:54:33.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:49.128 --> 06:54:49.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:52.670 --> 06:54:52.680 align:start position:0%
so hi I'm uh representative Gallagher
 
06:54:52.680 --> 06:54:53.510 align:start position:0%
so hi I'm uh representative Gallagher
again

06:54:53.510 --> 06:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
again
 
06:54:59.270 --> 06:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
um I would like to testify in support of
 
06:55:00.468 --> 06:55:00.478 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
06:55:02.410 --> 06:55:02.420 align:start position:0%
um it's
 
06:55:05.170 --> 06:55:05.180 align:start position:0%
similar to a bill
 
06:55:10.310 --> 06:55:10.320 align:start position:0%
that uh this this body passed last term
 
06:55:13.128 --> 06:55:13.138 align:start position:0%
and I thought it had actually already
 
06:55:13.138 --> 06:55:14.150 align:start position:0%
and I thought it had actually already
gone

06:55:14.150 --> 06:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
gone
 
06:55:17.868 --> 06:55:17.878 align:start position:0%
into law and when was surprised to
 
06:55:20.330 --> 06:55:20.340 align:start position:0%
discover that no it had actually
 
06:55:20.340 --> 06:55:21.048 align:start position:0%
discover that no it had actually
um

06:55:21.048 --> 06:55:21.058 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:55:23.868 --> 06:55:23.878 align:start position:0%
so I think it's worth giving another try
 
06:55:27.170 --> 06:55:27.180 align:start position:0%
um yeah I have
 
06:55:27.180 --> 06:55:28.368 align:start position:0%
um yeah I have
um

06:55:28.368 --> 06:55:28.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:55:31.310 --> 06:55:31.320 align:start position:0%
I I have encountered these
 
06:55:33.350 --> 06:55:33.360 align:start position:0%
checkpoints might so often would
 
06:55:38.448 --> 06:55:38.458 align:start position:0%
definitely have uh appreciated the
 
06:55:41.750 --> 06:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
notice of them beforehand
 
06:55:44.390 --> 06:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
um and yeah I'll keep it short and
 
06:55:49.250 --> 06:55:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:54.610 --> 06:55:54.620 align:start position:0%

I'm in front of you as one of the many

that stop under no suspicion by border
 
06:56:43.910 --> 06:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
patrol here in New Hampshire
 
06:56:46.250 --> 06:56:46.260 align:start position:0%
I lived in Thornton just miles away from
 
06:56:48.468 --> 06:56:48.478 align:start position:0%
the Woodstock Thornton area where border
 
06:56:51.770 --> 06:56:51.780 align:start position:0%
patrols are set on I-93
 
06:56:54.110 --> 06:56:54.120 align:start position:0%
I travel that way to go to work I travel
 
06:56:55.788 --> 06:56:55.798 align:start position:0%
that way to go grab my children from a
 
06:56:58.548 --> 06:56:58.558 align:start position:0%
school to do errands some from a simple
 
06:57:00.770 --> 06:57:00.780 align:start position:0%

Hampshire
 
06:57:38.270 --> 06:57:38.280 align:start position:0%
now when these checkpoints were
 
06:57:38.280 --> 06:57:39.468 align:start position:0%
now when these checkpoints were
happening

06:57:39.468 --> 06:57:39.478 align:start position:0%
happening
 
06:57:41.208 --> 06:57:41.218 align:start position:0%
I was performing a whole completely
 
06:57:42.530 --> 06:57:42.540 align:start position:0%
different job than what I have right now
 
06:57:44.448 --> 06:57:44.458 align:start position:0%
I was working in the hospitality
 
06:57:46.610 --> 06:57:46.620 align:start position:0%
industry up in the north country
 
06:57:48.590 --> 06:57:48.600 align:start position:0%
numerous times I received phone calls
 
06:57:50.868 --> 06:57:50.878 align:start position:0%
from guests and co-workers asking me if
 
06:57:52.128 --> 06:57:52.138 align:start position:0%
these checkpoints were happening during
 
06:57:53.890 --> 06:57:53.900 align:start position:0%
specific holidays
 
06:57:56.330 --> 06:57:56.340 align:start position:0%
holidays like the Labor Day weekend
 
06:57:59.208 --> 06:57:59.218 align:start position:0%
Memorial Day Fourth of July and
 
06:58:01.788 --> 06:58:01.798 align:start position:0%
sometimes during Laconia by week
 
06:58:04.670 --> 06:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
during that week CBP detained drivers
 
06:58:07.610 --> 06:58:07.620 align:start position:0%
carrying a small amount of marijuana
 
06:58:10.788 --> 06:58:10.798 align:start position:0%
thus far from enforcing immigration
 
06:58:12.948 --> 06:58:12.958 align:start position:0%
during one of these stops
 
06:58:15.048 --> 06:58:15.058 align:start position:0%
one of the officers told me that they
 
06:58:16.190 --> 06:58:16.200 align:start position:0%
were going to have the state police
 
06:58:17.868 --> 06:58:17.878 align:start position:0%
arrest me for obstructing the flow of
 
06:58:21.650 --> 06:58:21.660 align:start position:0%
traffic even though they stopped me
 
06:58:23.510 --> 06:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
they didn't have original suspicion for
 
06:58:27.410 --> 06:58:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:29.690 --> 06:58:29.700 align:start position:0%
they pulled me aside for after that they
 
06:58:32.208 --> 06:58:32.218 align:start position:0%
put me aside for a secondary inspection
 
06:58:34.010 --> 06:58:34.020 align:start position:0%
they run my tax and they left me go
 
06:58:36.770 --> 06:58:36.780 align:start position:0%
after a brief 10 minute episode
 
06:58:39.230 --> 06:58:39.240 align:start position:0%
during another occasion I was to stop
 
06:58:41.208 --> 06:58:41.218 align:start position:0%
close to an hour with a couple of
 
06:58:41.218 --> 06:58:42.048 align:start position:0%
close to an hour with a couple of
friends

06:58:42.048 --> 06:58:42.058 align:start position:0%
friends
 
06:58:45.170 --> 06:58:45.180 align:start position:0%
one of them of Muslim Muslim Origins was
 
06:58:46.968 --> 06:58:46.978 align:start position:0%
wearing a hijab
 
06:58:48.530 --> 06:58:48.540 align:start position:0%
we didn't comply in following our
 
06:58:50.150 --> 06:58:50.160 align:start position:0%
further memorize
 
06:58:52.250 --> 06:58:52.260 align:start position:0%
CBP officers told us to stay in our
 
06:58:54.708 --> 06:58:54.718 align:start position:0%
vehicles windows up while they were
 
06:58:54.718 --> 06:58:56.330 align:start position:0%
vehicles windows up while they were
processing

06:58:56.330 --> 06:58:56.340 align:start position:0%
processing
 
06:58:57.830 --> 06:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
mind you this was in the middle of
 
06:59:00.410 --> 06:59:00.420 align:start position:0%
summer with the windows down
 
06:59:02.090 --> 06:59:02.100 align:start position:0%
with the windows app I'm sorry it gets
 
06:59:04.310 --> 06:59:04.320 align:start position:0%
really hot inside a vehicle I told the
 
06:59:06.468 --> 06:59:06.478 align:start position:0%
officer the border patrol officer that I
 
06:59:08.090 --> 06:59:08.100 align:start position:0%
have breathing issues because I suffer
 
06:59:09.530 --> 06:59:09.540 align:start position:0%
from chronic asthma
 
06:59:11.810 --> 06:59:11.820 align:start position:0%
and you need to get some fresh air my
 
06:59:15.468 --> 06:59:15.478 align:start position:0%
request was ignore keep your windows up
 
06:59:17.510 --> 06:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
right before the right before the hour
 
06:59:19.310 --> 06:59:19.320 align:start position:0%
the CBP officer came back with a
 
06:59:19.320 --> 06:59:20.390 align:start position:0%
the CBP officer came back with a
clipboard

06:59:20.390 --> 06:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
clipboard
 
06:59:22.610 --> 06:59:22.620 align:start position:0%
and in that clipboard you can see that
 
06:59:24.288 --> 06:59:24.298 align:start position:0%
Facebook profile picture of the driver
 
06:59:27.170 --> 06:59:27.180 align:start position:0%
my Muslim friends a photo a personal
 
06:59:28.968 --> 06:59:28.978 align:start position:0%
photo that she does not use for any
 
06:59:31.610 --> 06:59:31.620 align:start position:0%
purpose not her driver's license or no
 
06:59:34.190 --> 06:59:34.200 align:start position:0%
her citizenship leadership forms this
 
06:59:36.948 --> 06:59:36.958 align:start position:0%
was her Facebook profile picture
 
06:59:39.048 --> 06:59:39.058 align:start position:0%
CBP sets these checkpoints with the
 
06:59:41.150 --> 06:59:41.160 align:start position:0%
purpose of immigration enforcement that
 
06:59:42.350 --> 06:59:42.360 align:start position:0%
do not work
 
06:59:44.628 --> 06:59:44.638 align:start position:0%
we stop and detain people for minor
 
06:59:46.610 --> 06:59:46.620 align:start position:0%
marijuana possessions
 
06:59:49.070 --> 06:59:49.080 align:start position:0%
and not for being here illegally
 
06:59:50.868 --> 06:59:50.878 align:start position:0%
these checkpoints are detrimental for
 
06:59:53.330 --> 06:59:53.340 align:start position:0%
businesses especially in the hospitality
 
06:59:53.340 --> 06:59:54.350 align:start position:0%
businesses especially in the hospitality
industry

06:59:54.350 --> 06:59:54.360 align:start position:0%
industry
 
06:59:56.150 --> 06:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
but most importantly these checkpoints
 
06:59:58.368 --> 06:59:58.378 align:start position:0%
leave a mark of unfairness
 
07:00:01.190 --> 07:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
for those that go abide by the law
 
07:00:03.890 --> 07:00:03.900 align:start position:0%
I traveled to I-93 regularly
 
07:00:06.170 --> 07:00:06.180 align:start position:0%
I live just miles away like I mentioned
 
07:00:06.180 --> 07:00:07.190 align:start position:0%
I live just miles away like I mentioned
earlier

07:00:07.190 --> 07:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
07:00:09.288 --> 07:00:09.298 align:start position:0%
fortunately enough all these stops
 
07:00:10.968 --> 07:00:10.978 align:start position:0%
happen while my family including my
 
07:00:13.070 --> 07:00:13.080 align:start position:0%
children were not in the vehicle I pray
 
07:00:14.810 --> 07:00:14.820 align:start position:0%
to God that they never get to experience
 
07:00:16.128 --> 07:00:16.138 align:start position:0%
the level of harassment from federal
 
07:00:16.138 --> 07:00:17.330 align:start position:0%
the level of harassment from federal
agencies

07:00:17.330 --> 07:00:17.340 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
07:00:19.190 --> 07:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
it happens aborig Crossings and other
 
07:00:20.750 --> 07:00:20.760 align:start position:0%
points of Entry
 
07:00:22.670 --> 07:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
but it can also happen in any point in
 
07:00:25.310 --> 07:00:25.320 align:start position:0%
any New Hampshire town inside the 100
 
07:00:27.830 --> 07:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
modu jurisdiction
 
07:00:29.690 --> 07:00:29.700 align:start position:0%
by that means every time that you also
 
07:00:29.700 --> 07:00:30.770 align:start position:0%
by that means every time that you also
serve

07:00:30.770 --> 07:00:30.780 align:start position:0%
serve
 
07:00:32.750 --> 07:00:32.760 align:start position:0%
if Americans do not continue to
 
07:00:34.430 --> 07:00:34.440 align:start position:0%
challenge expansion of federal power
 
07:00:37.670 --> 07:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
over the individual we risk for feeding
 
07:00:39.530 --> 07:00:39.540 align:start position:0%
the fundamental rights and freedoms that
 
07:00:41.750 --> 07:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
we narrated including the right to
 
07:00:43.730 --> 07:00:43.740 align:start position:0%
Simply go about our business free from
 
07:00:47.150 --> 07:00:47.160 align:start position:0%
government intrusion harassment or abuse
 
07:00:49.310 --> 07:00:49.320 align:start position:0%
I also want to mention that on one of
 
07:00:51.948 --> 07:00:51.958 align:start position:0%
the main plaintiffs on a federal lawsuit
 
07:00:51.958 --> 07:00:52.788 align:start position:0%
the main plaintiffs on a federal lawsuit
case

07:00:52.788 --> 07:00:52.798 align:start position:0%
case
 
07:00:54.890 --> 07:00:54.900 align:start position:0%
that we have file with the uh the folks
 
07:00:57.110 --> 07:00:57.120 align:start position:0%
with the SLU against the U.S Customs and
 
07:00:59.628 --> 07:00:59.638 align:start position:0%
Border Border Protection Agency that is
 
07:01:01.190 --> 07:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
currently in the U.S District Court in
 
07:01:03.230 --> 07:01:03.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we're challenging the
 
07:01:05.150 --> 07:01:05.160 align:start position:0%
constitutionality of these checkpoints
 
07:01:08.510 --> 07:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
so I ask you to please support hb624 to
 
07:01:09.948 --> 07:01:09.958 align:start position:0%
improve their relationship between law
 
07:01:12.650 --> 07:01:12.660 align:start position:0%
enforcement federal or estate and to
 
07:01:14.208 --> 07:01:14.218 align:start position:0%
give the granite Staters the freedom to
 
07:01:16.548 --> 07:01:16.558 align:start position:0%
travel and bother thank you so much and
 
07:01:17.868 --> 07:01:17.878 align:start position:0%
I will take any questions if you have
 
07:01:17.878 --> 07:01:18.708 align:start position:0%
I will take any questions if you have
any

07:01:18.708 --> 07:01:18.718 align:start position:0%
any
 
07:01:22.190 --> 07:01:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:25.310 --> 07:01:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:28.670 --> 07:01:28.680 align:start position:0%
what would you say to people
 
07:01:31.490 --> 07:01:31.500 align:start position:0%
who would maintain that the experience
 
07:01:33.110 --> 07:01:33.120 align:start position:0%
that you and your family go through is
 
07:01:35.330 --> 07:01:35.340 align:start position:0%
part of the price that we have to pay
 
07:01:38.750 --> 07:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
to secure our borders in this country
 
07:01:41.510 --> 07:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
you know I I
 
07:01:43.490 --> 07:01:43.500 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that our boards needs to be
 
07:01:45.530 --> 07:01:45.540 align:start position:0%
secure that's absolutely uh you know
 
07:01:47.390 --> 07:01:47.400 align:start position:0%
something that is fundamental four hours
 
07:01:50.030 --> 07:01:50.040 align:start position:0%
Homeland Security uh a hundred miles
 
07:01:51.890 --> 07:01:51.900 align:start position:0%
from the border I find it a little bit
 
07:01:53.690 --> 07:01:53.700 align:start position:0%
more intrusive if you do a border
 
07:01:55.548 --> 07:01:55.558 align:start position:0%
checkpoint maybe 10 miles 15 miles from
 
07:01:57.110 --> 07:01:57.120 align:start position:0%
you know from the Canadian line Derby
 
07:01:59.690 --> 07:01:59.700 align:start position:0%
line the Newport line I find that
 
07:02:02.330 --> 07:02:02.340 align:start position:0%
acceptable that's more reasonable but a
 
07:02:04.310 --> 07:02:04.320 align:start position:0%
hundred miles that's all the main all of
 
07:02:06.830 --> 07:02:06.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire half of Massachusetts
 
07:02:08.868 --> 07:02:08.878 align:start position:0%
is most you know two-thirds of the
 
07:02:10.490 --> 07:02:10.500 align:start position:0%
population in the U.S Leaf in the 100
 
07:02:12.708 --> 07:02:12.718 align:start position:0%
mile jurisdiction so that's that's
 
07:02:15.948 --> 07:02:15.958 align:start position:0%
that's my concern so why is happening
 
07:02:17.330 --> 07:02:17.340 align:start position:0%
you know these checkpoints happen in
 
07:02:20.270 --> 07:02:20.280 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth and I-95 it happens on 993 it
 
07:02:22.010 --> 07:02:22.020 align:start position:0%
happened in Clermont I don't remember
 
07:02:24.110 --> 07:02:24.120 align:start position:0%
the is like Clermont exit Windsor exit
 
07:02:26.030 --> 07:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
it happens all the time uh it hasn't
 
07:02:27.590 --> 07:02:27.600 align:start position:0%
happened for the last since Kobe
 
07:02:29.868 --> 07:02:29.878 align:start position:0%
happened but in the past in the past he
 
07:02:31.910 --> 07:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
did many times
 
07:02:31.920 --> 07:02:33.170 align:start position:0%
did many times
so

07:02:33.170 --> 07:02:33.180 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:02:37.250 --> 07:02:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:38.690 --> 07:02:38.700 align:start position:0%
thank you so much thank you for your
 
07:02:38.700 --> 07:02:41.270 align:start position:0%
thank you so much thank you for your
testimony

07:02:41.270 --> 07:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:52.190 --> 07:02:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:54.650 --> 07:02:54.660 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and members of
 
07:02:57.410 --> 07:02:57.420 align:start position:0%

07:03:04.910 --> 07:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
also worth noting that I'm also

the right thing to do
 
07:03:12.600 --> 07:03:13.368 align:start position:0%
the right thing to do
um

07:03:13.368 --> 07:03:13.378 align:start position:0%

07:03:54.590 --> 07:03:54.600 align:start position:0%
support hb624 Dash FN which would
 
07:03:57.110 --> 07:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
require a state county or Municipal law

of its intent to conduct to conduct an

of this committee to support hb624 FN
 
07:04:14.270 --> 07:04:14.280 align:start position:0%
and vote ought to pass
 
07:04:16.010 --> 07:04:16.020 align:start position:0%
immigration checkpoints in New Hampshire
 
07:04:18.548 --> 07:04:18.558 align:start position:0%
have been used for unlawful purposes
 
07:04:21.890 --> 07:04:21.900 align:start position:0%

England including New Hampshire most
 
07:04:31.670 --> 07:04:31.680 align:start position:0%

laconian Bike Week thousands of people
 
07:04:42.590 --> 07:04:42.600 align:start position:0%
were waylaid and forced through the
 
07:04:45.110 --> 07:04:45.120 align:start position:0%
checkpoints it is questionable whether
 
07:04:48.288 --> 07:04:48.298 align:start position:0%
CBP even had an expectation of
 
07:04:51.530 --> 07:04:51.540 align:start position:0%
apprehending unlawful border crossers of

number of migrants detained for alleged
 
07:05:08.570 --> 07:05:08.580 align:start position:0%
unlawful presence was quite small and
 
07:05:10.490 --> 07:05:10.500 align:start position:0%
there is no evidence that any had

crossed over the Canadian border
 
07:05:17.110 --> 07:05:17.120 align:start position:0%
the checkpoints caused Great
 
07:05:19.250 --> 07:05:19.260 align:start position:0%

effects on local businesses the
 
07:05:48.288 --> 07:05:48.298 align:start position:0%

the decision to conduct an immigration

not used for unlawful purposes such as
 
07:07:55.190 --> 07:07:55.200 align:start position:0%

07:07:56.810 --> 07:07:56.820 align:start position:0%
were in the most recent checkpoints

indiscriminate use of checkpoints also
 
07:08:04.850 --> 07:08:04.860 align:start position:0%
increase the risk of racial profiling in

other civil rights violations as people
 
07:08:09.530 --> 07:08:09.540 align:start position:0%

conducting checkpoints in New Hampshire
 
07:08:16.968 --> 07:08:16.978 align:start position:0%

07:09:55.730 --> 07:09:55.740 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Mark Hall I'm
 
07:09:58.010 --> 07:09:58.020 align:start position:0%
a major commander of the operations
 
07:09:59.510 --> 07:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
Bureau with the New Hampshire State
 
07:09:59.520 --> 07:10:00.910 align:start position:0%
Bureau with the New Hampshire State
Police

07:10:00.910 --> 07:10:00.920 align:start position:0%
Police
 
07:10:02.868 --> 07:10:02.878 align:start position:0%
we don't
 
07:10:05.150 --> 07:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
take a bill a
 
07:10:06.948 --> 07:10:06.958 align:start position:0%
position on this bill at this time but
 
07:10:08.330 --> 07:10:08.340 align:start position:0%
I'm here to provide some educational
 
07:10:12.708 --> 07:10:12.718 align:start position:0%
testimony as to how the bill is written
 
07:10:14.628 --> 07:10:14.638 align:start position:0%
we're not responsible the state police
 
07:10:17.330 --> 07:10:17.340 align:start position:0%
is not responsible for Federal Highway
 
07:10:19.910 --> 07:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
checkpoints or immigration enforcement
 
07:10:22.610 --> 07:10:22.620 align:start position:0%
we are responsible for Highway Safety
 
07:10:27.650 --> 07:10:27.660 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:30.890 --> 07:10:30.900 align:start position:0%
as far as managing managing highway
 
07:10:32.930 --> 07:10:32.940 align:start position:0%
safety when these checkpoints are
 
07:10:36.770 --> 07:10:36.780 align:start position:0%
conducted they do can they do uh
 
07:10:39.288 --> 07:10:39.298 align:start position:0%
create a highway safety concern
 
07:10:40.968 --> 07:10:40.978 align:start position:0%
particularly on the interstate highways
 
07:10:44.530 --> 07:10:44.540 align:start position:0%
and our job is to continue to provide
 
07:10:48.048 --> 07:10:48.058 align:start position:0%
Public Safety on those highways during
 
07:10:49.810 --> 07:10:49.820 align:start position:0%
the the events
 
07:10:52.850 --> 07:10:52.860 align:start position:0%
also to provide backup when requested
 
07:10:56.868 --> 07:10:56.878 align:start position:0%
and also enforce state laws
 
07:10:59.090 --> 07:10:59.100 align:start position:0%
something to consider with this bill is
 
07:11:02.690 --> 07:11:02.700 align:start position:0%
the notification from border patrol we
 
07:11:05.330 --> 07:11:05.340 align:start position:0%
don't we don't often have an exact time
 
07:11:08.090 --> 07:11:08.100 align:start position:0%
frame of when border patrol would notify
 
07:11:09.430 --> 07:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
us that they're going to do a checkpoint
 
07:11:12.468 --> 07:11:12.478 align:start position:0%
however uh
 
07:11:14.510 --> 07:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
complying with this bill border patrol
 
07:11:16.930 --> 07:11:16.940 align:start position:0%
would likely not notify us
 
07:11:20.930 --> 07:11:20.940 align:start position:0%
in the future of these checkpoints which
 
07:11:23.448 --> 07:11:23.458 align:start position:0%
would further limit our abilities to
 
07:11:25.850 --> 07:11:25.860 align:start position:0%
provide Public Safety on the highways
 
07:11:27.530 --> 07:11:27.540 align:start position:0%
when we don't know about the checkpoint
 
07:11:30.170 --> 07:11:30.180 align:start position:0%
taking place so it has asked that you
 
07:11:32.570 --> 07:11:32.580 align:start position:0%
consider that with the way this bill is
 
07:11:32.580 --> 07:11:35.150 align:start position:0%
consider that with the way this bill is
written

07:11:35.150 --> 07:11:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:39.110 --> 07:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
we are generally notified but
 
07:11:41.990 --> 07:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
it's very likely that we wouldn't be uh
 
07:11:44.270 --> 07:11:44.280 align:start position:0%
under this bill that's all I have them
 
07:11:46.368 --> 07:11:46.378 align:start position:0%
it'll take any questions if you have
 
07:11:46.378 --> 07:11:48.708 align:start position:0%
it'll take any questions if you have
them

07:11:48.708 --> 07:11:48.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:50.990 --> 07:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler
 
07:11:52.548 --> 07:11:52.558 align:start position:0%
Madam chair
 
07:11:54.830 --> 07:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
um so you're saying the federal
 
07:11:56.810 --> 07:11:56.820 align:start position:0%
government wouldn't notify the New
 
07:11:58.548 --> 07:11:58.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state government of a border
 
07:12:00.110 --> 07:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
patrol checkpoint if this legislation
 
07:12:02.750 --> 07:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:06.048 --> 07:12:06.058 align:start position:0%
this is all in my opinion is
 
07:12:08.390 --> 07:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
um there's no requirement necessarily
 
07:12:10.310 --> 07:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
for them to notify us when they do
 
07:12:11.690 --> 07:12:11.700 align:start position:0%
notify us that there's a checkpoint
 
07:12:14.090 --> 07:12:14.100 align:start position:0%
taking place we're not assisting them
 
07:12:15.530 --> 07:12:15.540 align:start position:0%
with the checkpoint we're just ensuring
 
07:12:18.890 --> 07:12:18.900 align:start position:0%
that there's Public Safety however I
 
07:12:22.250 --> 07:12:22.260 align:start position:0%
would assume that us notifying the
 
07:12:23.448 --> 07:12:23.458 align:start position:0%
public ahead of time of those
 
07:12:26.330 --> 07:12:26.340 align:start position:0%
checkpoints would only cause them to not
 
07:12:28.448 --> 07:12:28.458 align:start position:0%
want to notify us
 
07:12:30.410 --> 07:12:30.420 align:start position:0%
they're going to do the checkpoints
 
07:12:32.288 --> 07:12:32.298 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether we
 
07:12:34.788 --> 07:12:34.798 align:start position:0%
participate or help them in any way
 
07:12:37.850 --> 07:12:37.860 align:start position:0%
they're going to do the checkpoints and
 
07:12:39.468 --> 07:12:39.478 align:start position:0%
quite honestly I would rather be
 
07:12:41.510 --> 07:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
informed that the checkpoints are going
 
07:12:42.948 --> 07:12:42.958 align:start position:0%
to take place so that we can provide
 
07:12:44.570 --> 07:12:44.580 align:start position:0%
what our mission is and that's highway
 
07:12:47.868 --> 07:12:47.878 align:start position:0%
safety Public Safety
 
07:12:52.310 --> 07:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:54.530 --> 07:12:54.540 align:start position:0%
so the federal government could have a
 
07:12:59.150 --> 07:12:59.160 align:start position:0%
checkpoint on our roadways without the
 
07:13:01.090 --> 07:13:01.100 align:start position:0%
knowledge of the state police
 
07:13:03.530 --> 07:13:03.540 align:start position:0%
I could see representative Eaton nodding
 
07:13:04.850 --> 07:13:04.860 align:start position:0%
his head back there thank you okay
 
07:13:08.628 --> 07:13:08.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:11.270 --> 07:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
just a quick question
 
07:13:13.670 --> 07:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
is the is the public still notified if
 
07:13:14.750 --> 07:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a sobriety
 
07:13:14.760 --> 07:13:18.650 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a sobriety
checkpoint

07:13:18.650 --> 07:13:18.660 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:21.530 --> 07:13:21.540 align:start position:0%
thank you is there any more questions
 
07:13:23.628 --> 07:13:23.638 align:start position:0%
representative Muse
 
07:13:26.270 --> 07:13:26.280 align:start position:0%
are you aware of any other states that
 
07:13:29.510 --> 07:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
have a provision like this
 
07:13:31.730 --> 07:13:31.740 align:start position:0%
uh no sir I'm not I'm not aware of any
 
07:13:33.708 --> 07:13:33.718 align:start position:0%
uh that doesn't mean there isn't but I'm
 
07:13:35.030 --> 07:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
not aware of any
 
07:13:38.390 --> 07:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:39.708 --> 07:13:39.718 align:start position:0%
see no more questions thank you for your
 
07:13:42.650 --> 07:13:42.660 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you
 
07:14:11.510 --> 07:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:13.190 --> 07:14:13.200 align:start position:0%
uh Madam chair members of the committee
 
07:14:14.390 --> 07:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for the opportunity to
 
07:14:15.830 --> 07:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
testify today my name is Frank connect
 
07:14:17.750 --> 07:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
policy director with the ACLU New
 
07:14:19.150 --> 07:14:19.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm here with my colleague
 
07:14:22.010 --> 07:14:22.020 align:start position:0%
Jill Bissonnet our legal director nice
 
07:14:23.448 --> 07:14:23.458 align:start position:0%
to see everyone thank you
 
07:14:25.610 --> 07:14:25.620 align:start position:0%
and Geo came he's actually litigating
 
07:14:27.170 --> 07:14:27.180 align:start position:0%
the case that was referenced earlier so
 
07:14:28.368 --> 07:14:28.378 align:start position:0%
in case there's any questions we wanted
 
07:14:31.070 --> 07:14:31.080 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we could answer those
 
07:14:31.080 --> 07:14:32.390 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we could answer those
um

07:14:32.390 --> 07:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:14:35.208 --> 07:14:35.218 align:start position:0%
so I want to touch on on a few things I
 
07:14:37.010 --> 07:14:37.020 align:start position:0%
have a handout and you'll see in the
 
07:14:38.570 --> 07:14:38.580 align:start position:0%
handout there's an attachment to that
 
07:14:40.250 --> 07:14:40.260 align:start position:0%
which has the
 
07:14:42.770 --> 07:14:42.780 align:start position:0%
um law enforcement Manual of the State
 
07:14:44.090 --> 07:14:44.100 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire which includes the
 
07:14:46.670 --> 07:14:46.680 align:start position:0%
sobriety checkpoint language and so the
 
07:14:48.230 --> 07:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill is really to mirror
 
07:14:50.030 --> 07:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
the sobriety checkpoint language and if
 
07:14:51.770 --> 07:14:51.780 align:start position:0%
you look at the manual that I attached
 
07:14:53.868 --> 07:14:53.878 align:start position:0%
in there the attorney Attorney General
 
07:14:55.548 --> 07:14:55.558 align:start position:0%
indicates in the manual that the the
 
07:14:57.530 --> 07:14:57.540 align:start position:0%
importance of sobriety checkpoint notice
 
07:14:59.448 --> 07:14:59.458 align:start position:0%
is to quote minimize motor surprise
 
07:15:01.910 --> 07:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
apprehension and inconvenience and we're
 
07:15:03.410 --> 07:15:03.420 align:start position:0%
just trying to bring that same standard
 
07:15:05.990 --> 07:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
in that same notice and protection to
 
07:15:08.090 --> 07:15:08.100 align:start position:0%
immigration checkpoints that are
 
07:15:10.310 --> 07:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
happening here
 
07:15:11.810 --> 07:15:11.820 align:start position:0%
um I also really want to I would like to
 
07:15:13.490 --> 07:15:13.500 align:start position:0%
flag that this bill came out of the
 
07:15:17.208 --> 07:15:17.218 align:start position:0%
house last year with a vote of 254 to 85
 
07:15:19.250 --> 07:15:19.260 align:start position:0%
with overwhelming bipartisan support
 
07:15:20.810 --> 07:15:20.820 align:start position:0%
this is an issue that's been looked at
 
07:15:23.750 --> 07:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
heavily by this committee by this body
 
07:15:26.330 --> 07:15:26.340 align:start position:0%
and so we are optimistic and hopeful
 
07:15:27.788 --> 07:15:27.798 align:start position:0%
that you all will
 
07:15:29.628 --> 07:15:29.638 align:start position:0%
consider that
 
07:15:31.310 --> 07:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
um when you're when you're debating this
 
07:15:31.320 --> 07:15:32.030 align:start position:0%
um when you're when you're debating this
year

07:15:32.030 --> 07:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
year
 
07:15:33.770 --> 07:15:33.780 align:start position:0%
so as you heard
 
07:15:33.780 --> 07:15:34.490 align:start position:0%
so as you heard
um

07:15:34.490 --> 07:15:34.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:15:37.010 --> 07:15:37.020 align:start position:0%
we've heard the primary purpose of of
 
07:15:39.590 --> 07:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
these immigration checkpoints is is to
 
07:15:41.030 --> 07:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
try and get
 
07:15:42.730 --> 07:15:42.740 align:start position:0%
um to stop
 
07:15:45.110 --> 07:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
the screening for immigration violations
 
07:15:46.548 --> 07:15:46.558 align:start position:0%
and so we've heard that over and over
 
07:15:49.070 --> 07:15:49.080 align:start position:0%
again as the justification for that and
 
07:15:50.750 --> 07:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
so fortunately through litigation you
 
07:15:52.310 --> 07:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
don't have to listen to just what you
 
07:15:53.930 --> 07:15:53.940 align:start position:0%
know we at the ACL you have to say we
 
07:15:55.490 --> 07:15:55.500 align:start position:0%
can actually look at what a judge the
 
07:15:58.070 --> 07:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
judge found and so
 
07:15:59.390 --> 07:15:59.400 align:start position:0%
um in a case
 
07:16:01.910 --> 07:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire versus McCarthy
 
07:16:03.770 --> 07:16:03.780 align:start position:0%
um in the second circuit
 
07:16:05.448 --> 07:16:05.458 align:start position:0%
um this is directly from the opinion
 
07:16:07.548 --> 07:16:07.558 align:start position:0%
quote this court finds that while the
 
07:16:09.110 --> 07:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
stated purpose of the checkpoints in
 
07:16:10.310 --> 07:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
this matter was screening for
 
07:16:12.048 --> 07:16:12.058 align:start position:0%
immigration violations the primary
 
07:16:13.670 --> 07:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
purpose of the action was the detection
 
07:16:16.250 --> 07:16:16.260 align:start position:0%
and Caesar of drugs and the reason that
 
07:16:17.690 --> 07:16:17.700 align:start position:0%
that's important is because New
 
07:16:19.850 --> 07:16:19.860 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Constitution unlike our
 
07:16:21.788 --> 07:16:21.798 align:start position:0%
neighbors in Maine for example
 
07:16:24.830 --> 07:16:24.840 align:start position:0%
protects it says that the Supreme Court
 
07:16:26.448 --> 07:16:26.458 align:start position:0%
has found that when employing trained
 
07:16:29.390 --> 07:16:29.400 align:start position:0%
canines to sniff a private person's
 
07:16:31.490 --> 07:16:31.500 align:start position:0%
vehicle in order to determine whether
 
07:16:33.048 --> 07:16:33.058 align:start position:0%
controlled substances are concealed
 
07:16:35.330 --> 07:16:35.340 align:start position:0%
inside is certainly a search in these
 
07:16:38.868 --> 07:16:38.878 align:start position:0%
terms and that therefore there has to be
 
07:16:40.850 --> 07:16:40.860 align:start position:0%
an articulable and reasonable suspicion
 
07:16:43.128 --> 07:16:43.138 align:start position:0%
of criminal activity to engage to use
 
07:16:45.468 --> 07:16:45.478 align:start position:0%
the canine and so because under our
 
07:16:47.208 --> 07:16:47.218 align:start position:0%
state law under the state constitution
 
07:16:50.810 --> 07:16:50.820 align:start position:0%
we can't use drugs in that instance to
 
07:16:52.788 --> 07:16:52.798 align:start position:0%
just pull people over and search without
 
07:16:54.610 --> 07:16:54.620 align:start position:0%
any reasonable suspension
 
07:16:57.110 --> 07:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
border patrol are able to do that and
 
07:17:00.230 --> 07:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
get and run around New Hampshire law and
 
07:17:01.788 --> 07:17:01.798 align:start position:0%
if you notice about how this has worked
 
07:17:03.468 --> 07:17:03.478 align:start position:0%
in practice it'll often be coordinated
 
07:17:06.350 --> 07:17:06.360 align:start position:0%
with local police and so CBP will do the
 
07:17:08.208 --> 07:17:08.218 align:start position:0%
searches they'll have the dog sniffs if
 
07:17:10.310 --> 07:17:10.320 align:start position:0%
they find drugs then they will actually
 
07:17:12.170 --> 07:17:12.180 align:start position:0%
turn that over to local law enforcement
 
07:17:14.090 --> 07:17:14.100 align:start position:0%
the prosecute under state law so what
 
07:17:15.590 --> 07:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
you're really seeing here is a complete
 
07:17:17.868 --> 07:17:17.878 align:start position:0%
end run around our Constitution which we
 
07:17:19.670 --> 07:17:19.680 align:start position:0%
think is wrong and shouldn't be
 
07:17:19.680 --> 07:17:20.810 align:start position:0%
think is wrong and shouldn't be
happening

07:17:20.810 --> 07:17:20.820 align:start position:0%
happening
 
07:17:23.270 --> 07:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
and again when when we when we heard
 
07:17:25.010 --> 07:17:25.020 align:start position:0%
from CBP is that this is really about
 
07:17:27.048 --> 07:17:27.058 align:start position:0%
trying to get uh people coming over
 
07:17:29.270 --> 07:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
illegally and so again looking at the
 
07:17:29.280 --> 07:17:30.890 align:start position:0%
illegally and so again looking at the
opinion

07:17:30.890 --> 07:17:30.900 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
07:17:33.948 --> 07:17:33.958 align:start position:0%
um they know in the opinion that the CBP
 
07:17:36.410 --> 07:17:36.420 align:start position:0%
officer testified quote that he has
 
07:17:38.448 --> 07:17:38.458 align:start position:0%
never located a concealed human in a
 
07:17:40.868 --> 07:17:40.878 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle in his 17 years of service
 
07:17:43.910 --> 07:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
and so this is not happening again this
 
07:17:45.590 --> 07:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
is really about searching for drugs it's
 
07:17:47.270 --> 07:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
about and run about the around the
 
07:17:47.280 --> 07:17:49.368 align:start position:0%
about and run about the around the
Constitution

07:17:49.368 --> 07:17:49.378 align:start position:0%
Constitution
 
07:17:50.930 --> 07:17:50.940 align:start position:0%
um and you know finally this is not
 
07:17:53.390 --> 07:17:53.400 align:start position:0%
putting any real burden on local law
 
07:17:54.890 --> 07:17:54.900 align:start position:0%
enforcement there is no affirmative
 
07:17:56.690 --> 07:17:56.700 align:start position:0%
obligation of law enforcement to go out
 
07:17:58.310 --> 07:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
and seek information about whether or
 
07:18:00.530 --> 07:18:00.540 align:start position:0%
not these are happening if they find out
 
07:18:02.448 --> 07:18:02.458 align:start position:0%
there's they're happening then they're
 
07:18:04.310 --> 07:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
required to provide notice but they're
 
07:18:07.010 --> 07:18:07.020 align:start position:0%
given wide latitude on what type of how
 
07:18:08.448 --> 07:18:08.458 align:start position:0%
they provide that notice so we're not
 
07:18:10.968 --> 07:18:10.978 align:start position:0%
saying they have to do X Y or Z they can
 
07:18:12.708 --> 07:18:12.718 align:start position:0%
use any of their multiple tools at their
 
07:18:15.530 --> 07:18:15.540 align:start position:0%
discretion to provide that notice um and
 
07:18:17.448 --> 07:18:17.458 align:start position:0%
so the you know the notion that as we
 
07:18:19.670 --> 07:18:19.680 align:start position:0%
heard from State Police that they're not
 
07:18:21.170 --> 07:18:21.180 align:start position:0%
going to find out about this well you
 
07:18:22.730 --> 07:18:22.740 align:start position:0%
know the court found that this is really
 
07:18:24.288 --> 07:18:24.298 align:start position:0%
about finding you know and run around
 
07:18:25.968 --> 07:18:25.978 align:start position:0%
the Constitution around finding drugs
 
07:18:28.430 --> 07:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
and so it's it's unlikely that that's
 
07:18:32.708 --> 07:18:32.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:36.708 --> 07:18:36.718 align:start position:0%
yes I would just note that I
 
07:18:38.330 --> 07:18:38.340 align:start position:0%
I think it's clear that whenever these
 
07:18:40.250 --> 07:18:40.260 align:start position:0%
checkpoints occur State Police is
 
07:18:42.948 --> 07:18:42.958 align:start position:0%
notified they could be given a
 
07:18:44.448 --> 07:18:44.458 align:start position:0%
significant time duration a lot of
 
07:18:46.190 --> 07:18:46.200 align:start position:0%
notice or they can be given a little
 
07:18:47.628 --> 07:18:47.638 align:start position:0%
amount of notice
 
07:18:49.128 --> 07:18:49.138 align:start position:0%
um but regardless under this legislation
 
07:18:50.448 --> 07:18:50.458 align:start position:0%
all it's just saying is when you find
 
07:18:52.010 --> 07:18:52.020 align:start position:0%
out whenever it is it could be one
 
07:18:53.570 --> 07:18:53.580 align:start position:0%
moment before the checkpoint starts
 
07:18:55.968 --> 07:18:55.978 align:start position:0%
right or it could be a week before the
 
07:18:57.770 --> 07:18:57.780 align:start position:0%
checkpoint starts just provide notice on
 
07:19:00.110 --> 07:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
a timely basis to the population we do
 
07:19:01.850 --> 07:19:01.860 align:start position:0%
know at some point in the process the
 
07:19:03.048 --> 07:19:03.058 align:start position:0%
state police is going to become aware of
 
07:19:04.310 --> 07:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
a checkpoint right because they're
 
07:19:05.868 --> 07:19:05.878 align:start position:0%
obviously Traffic Safety implications
 
07:19:07.610 --> 07:19:07.620 align:start position:0%
that the state police testify to so
 
07:19:10.010 --> 07:19:10.020 align:start position:0%
again all this is saying is once they
 
07:19:12.468 --> 07:19:12.478 align:start position:0%
become aware whenever that is
 
07:19:14.810 --> 07:19:14.820 align:start position:0%
send out a tweet or do you know
 
07:19:17.208 --> 07:19:17.218 align:start position:0%
literally you don't there's there's no
 
07:19:18.650 --> 07:19:18.660 align:start position:0%
massive requirement here on the state
 
07:19:20.810 --> 07:19:20.820 align:start position:0%
police to do anything or any law
 
07:19:22.670 --> 07:19:22.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement body that that uh becomes
 
07:19:23.868 --> 07:19:23.878 align:start position:0%
aware of a checkpoint so I just wanted
 
07:19:26.690 --> 07:19:26.700 align:start position:0%
to make that clear thank you
 
07:19:27.830 --> 07:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:19:30.468 --> 07:19:30.478 align:start position:0%
representative Newman
 
07:19:31.968 --> 07:19:31.978 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
07:19:34.070 --> 07:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
07:19:35.750 --> 07:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
um I'm looking at the state law for
 
07:19:38.510 --> 07:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
sobriety checkpoints and the requirement
 
07:19:41.030 --> 07:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
is there that the court issues and
 
07:19:42.890 --> 07:19:42.900 align:start position:0%
orders authorizing sobriety checkpoint
 
07:19:44.270 --> 07:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
after determining that the sobriety
 
07:19:47.090 --> 07:19:47.100 align:start position:0%
checkpoint is warranted and the proposed
 
07:19:49.128 --> 07:19:49.138 align:start position:0%
method of stopping Vehicles satisfies
 
07:19:51.530 --> 07:19:51.540 align:start position:0%
constitutional guarantees
 
07:19:53.510 --> 07:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
so that's for that's for sobriety
 
07:19:53.520 --> 07:19:55.250 align:start position:0%
so that's for that's for sobriety
checkpoints

07:19:55.250 --> 07:19:55.260 align:start position:0%
checkpoints
 
07:19:56.930 --> 07:19:56.940 align:start position:0%
um and I've heard you now say that there
 
07:19:58.910 --> 07:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
are state laws that would apply to you
 
07:20:02.150 --> 07:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
know you quoted court cases that said
 
07:20:03.590 --> 07:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
there are state laws that require
 
07:20:03.600 --> 07:20:05.270 align:start position:0%
there are state laws that require
notification

07:20:05.270 --> 07:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
notification
 
07:20:07.910 --> 07:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
is that in procedures or rules or I'm
 
07:20:09.468 --> 07:20:09.478 align:start position:0%
confused because I can't find it in
 
07:20:11.150 --> 07:20:11.160 align:start position:0%
state law there's there's a reason it's
 
07:20:12.468 --> 07:20:12.478 align:start position:0%
actually it's it's part of the
 
07:20:13.788 --> 07:20:13.798 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice law enforcement
 
07:20:13.798 --> 07:20:14.930 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice law enforcement
manual

07:20:14.930 --> 07:20:14.940 align:start position:0%
manual
 
07:20:16.548 --> 07:20:16.558 align:start position:0%
so uh and I believe I don't know if that
 
07:20:18.830 --> 07:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
was attached it it should be attached
 
07:20:20.448 --> 07:20:20.458 align:start position:0%
and that's that's where the 24-hour
 
07:20:22.850 --> 07:20:22.860 align:start position:0%
figure comes from again trying to as
 
07:20:25.490 --> 07:20:25.500 align:start position:0%
closely as one could try to mirror that
 
07:20:25.500 --> 07:20:28.270 align:start position:0%
closely as one could try to mirror that
process

07:20:28.270 --> 07:20:28.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:30.770 --> 07:20:30.780 align:start position:0%
so there is no state law that
 
07:20:33.530 --> 07:20:33.540 align:start position:0%
specifically either for DWI checkpoints
 
07:20:33.540 --> 07:20:35.150 align:start position:0%
specifically either for DWI checkpoints
or

07:20:35.150 --> 07:20:35.160 align:start position:0%
or
 
07:20:38.170 --> 07:20:38.180 align:start position:0%
or for these checkpoints would require
 
07:20:40.610 --> 07:20:40.620 align:start position:0%
what what is I mean it puts a lot of
 
07:20:42.650 --> 07:20:42.660 align:start position:0%
detail in here that detail is in that
 
07:20:42.660 --> 07:20:44.090 align:start position:0%
detail in here that detail is in that
handbook

07:20:44.090 --> 07:20:44.100 align:start position:0%
handbook
 
07:20:46.788 --> 07:20:46.798 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you and what we've done
 
07:20:49.070 --> 07:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
is we've circled the relevant provisions
 
07:20:50.990 --> 07:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
of the handbook that deal with sobriety
 
07:20:51.000 --> 07:20:52.430 align:start position:0%
of the handbook that deal with sobriety
checkpoints

07:20:52.430 --> 07:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
checkpoints
 
07:20:54.110 --> 07:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
um and that's that's is what we use as a
 
07:20:55.490 --> 07:20:55.500 align:start position:0%
benchmark here and trying to draft this
 
07:20:55.500 --> 07:20:58.368 align:start position:0%
benchmark here and trying to draft this
legislation

07:20:58.368 --> 07:20:58.378 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:00.948 --> 07:21:00.958 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:21:02.930 --> 07:21:02.940 align:start position:0%
are there any more questions
 
07:21:02.940 --> 07:21:04.448 align:start position:0%
are there any more questions
oh

07:21:04.448 --> 07:21:04.458 align:start position:0%
oh
 
07:21:06.890 --> 07:21:06.900 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you madam
 
07:21:07.910 --> 07:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
07:21:09.948 --> 07:21:09.958 align:start position:0%
question I was just wondering if either
 
07:21:12.110 --> 07:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
of you had any comment on what the
 
07:21:14.150 --> 07:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
commander mentioned earlier about you
 
07:21:16.850 --> 07:21:16.860 align:start position:0%
know if say this passes and now um you
 
07:21:18.770 --> 07:21:18.780 align:start position:0%
know currently it seems like federal law
 
07:21:20.930 --> 07:21:20.940 align:start position:0%
enforcement does notify State Police
 
07:21:23.270 --> 07:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
when they're doing these checkpoints so
 
07:21:26.510 --> 07:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
that they can ensure highway safety and
 
07:21:28.250 --> 07:21:28.260 align:start position:0%
so say this bill passes and now they no
 
07:21:29.868 --> 07:21:29.878 align:start position:0%
longer give them notification because
 
07:21:31.850 --> 07:21:31.860 align:start position:0%
they want to get around this public
 
07:21:33.830 --> 07:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
notification that the state police would
 
07:21:35.510 --> 07:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
be required to do I was just wondering
 
07:21:37.190 --> 07:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
if that you have any comment on the
 
07:21:38.990 --> 07:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
impacts that could have respectfully
 
07:21:40.190 --> 07:21:40.200 align:start position:0%
with all due respect the state police
 
07:21:41.628 --> 07:21:41.638 align:start position:0%
that seemed like more of a hunch to me
 
07:21:44.208 --> 07:21:44.218 align:start position:0%
than anything else I mean I I think it's
 
07:21:46.850 --> 07:21:46.860 align:start position:0%
an opinion my opinion is that in
 
07:21:49.128 --> 07:21:49.138 align:start position:0%
practice they are absolutely going to be
 
07:21:50.990 --> 07:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
notified at some point because they have
 
07:21:52.430 --> 07:21:52.440 align:start position:0%
to be because they are the relevant
 
07:21:54.468 --> 07:21:54.478 align:start position:0%
state agency that is managing the
 
07:21:56.030 --> 07:21:56.040 align:start position:0%
traffic safety implications of the
 
07:21:57.890 --> 07:21:57.900 align:start position:0%
checkpoint so
 
07:21:59.690 --> 07:21:59.700 align:start position:0%
um respectfully I just fundamentally
 
07:22:01.850 --> 07:22:01.860 align:start position:0%
disagree at some point during this
 
07:22:03.948 --> 07:22:03.958 align:start position:0%
process whether it's with significant
 
07:22:06.110 --> 07:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
notice or small relatively small amount
 
07:22:08.750 --> 07:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
notice they will be notified they have
 
07:22:10.788 --> 07:22:10.798 align:start position:0%
to be notified and all this bill again
 
07:22:13.250 --> 07:22:13.260 align:start position:0%
says is once that happens let the public
 
07:22:13.260 --> 07:22:14.990 align:start position:0%
says is once that happens let the public
know

07:22:14.990 --> 07:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
know
 
07:22:17.208 --> 07:22:17.218 align:start position:0%
representative Muse oh sorry can I just
 
07:22:18.650 --> 07:22:18.660 align:start position:0%
follow up on that real quick and also
 
07:22:21.230 --> 07:22:21.240 align:start position:0%
just to to reiterate what the um State
 
07:22:22.788 --> 07:22:22.798 align:start position:0%
Police said in their testimony they said
 
07:22:24.948 --> 07:22:24.958 align:start position:0%
this is I wrote down notes and not
 
07:22:26.990 --> 07:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
verbatim but that these checkpoints
 
07:22:28.850 --> 07:22:28.860 align:start position:0%
create a highway safety concern and so
 
07:22:30.230 --> 07:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
the notion that the federal government
 
07:22:31.850 --> 07:22:31.860 align:start position:0%
wouldn't provide notice when something
 
07:22:33.650 --> 07:22:33.660 align:start position:0%
the state police is saying is creating a
 
07:22:35.570 --> 07:22:35.580 align:start position:0%
highway traffic concern would be
 
07:22:38.770 --> 07:22:38.780 align:start position:0%
problematic in in its own right
 
07:22:40.968 --> 07:22:40.978 align:start position:0%
representative Muse
 
07:22:43.490 --> 07:22:43.500 align:start position:0%
yes um
 
07:22:46.190 --> 07:22:46.200 align:start position:0%
the bill that is in front of us today is
 
07:22:51.170 --> 07:22:51.180 align:start position:0%
this essentially uh HP 579 from 2022 as
 
07:22:53.570 --> 07:22:53.580 align:start position:0%
amended by the committee
 
07:22:55.730 --> 07:22:55.740 align:start position:0%
so there should be an amendment that I
 
07:22:56.990 --> 07:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
think will be brought before you that
 
07:22:58.730 --> 07:22:58.740 align:start position:0%
would make it mirror the original intent
 
07:23:00.410 --> 07:23:00.420 align:start position:0%
was to have it mirror the amended
 
07:23:01.910 --> 07:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
version from last year there's an
 
07:23:03.350 --> 07:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
amendment that will make sure that they
 
07:23:04.730 --> 07:23:04.740 align:start position:0%
there is I think there was an issue with
 
07:23:06.590 --> 07:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
OLS but they'll be
 
07:23:07.788 --> 07:23:07.798 align:start position:0%
I think there should be an amendment
 
07:23:10.910 --> 07:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
before you for that thank you
 
07:23:10.920 --> 07:23:12.548 align:start position:0%
before you for that thank you
good

07:23:12.548 --> 07:23:12.558 align:start position:0%
good
 
07:23:14.628 --> 07:23:14.638 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
07:23:16.128 --> 07:23:16.138 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:23:18.048 --> 07:23:18.058 align:start position:0%
is there anybody else wishing to testify
 
07:23:19.968 --> 07:23:19.978 align:start position:0%
on this bill that has not turned in a
 
07:23:22.250 --> 07:23:22.260 align:start position:0%
pink card
 
07:23:23.990 --> 07:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
seeing none I will close the public
 
07:23:28.548 --> 07:23:28.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:31.368 --> 07:23:31.378 align:start position:0%
foreign we will open the public hearing
 
07:24:30.350 --> 07:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:31.788 --> 07:24:31.798 align:start position:0%
for everybody that is here in the public
 
07:24:33.650 --> 07:24:33.660 align:start position:0%
we have quite a few people that wish to
 
07:24:37.910 --> 07:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
testify I I think we have 10 cards so
 
07:24:40.430 --> 07:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
after the sponsor is done taking the
 
07:24:42.368 --> 07:24:42.378 align:start position:0%
time that he needs we are going to
 
07:24:45.110 --> 07:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
implement a three-minute time limit on
 
07:24:46.910 --> 07:24:46.920 align:start position:0%
the testimony
 
07:24:48.948 --> 07:24:48.958 align:start position:0%
representative Barry the floor is yours
 
07:24:52.910 --> 07:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
thank you uh chairman Rose I like that
 
07:24:55.548 --> 07:24:55.558 align:start position:0%
chairman I like that
 
07:24:58.730 --> 07:24:58.740 align:start position:0%
um a good afternoon uh late afternoon my
 
07:25:00.708 --> 07:25:00.718 align:start position:0%
name is Ross Berry I'm the state
 
07:25:02.230 --> 07:25:02.240 align:start position:0%
representative for Hillsboro 39
 
07:25:04.968 --> 07:25:04.978 align:start position:0%
representing uh the South the south end
 
07:25:06.350 --> 07:25:06.360 align:start position:0%
of Manchester and the Far East Side
 
07:25:09.948 --> 07:25:09.958 align:start position:0%
wards six eight and nine I'm here today
 
07:25:13.910 --> 07:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
to introduce House Bill 653 which deals
 
07:25:16.850 --> 07:25:16.860 align:start position:0%
with personal cognizance bail for uh
 
07:25:21.048 --> 07:25:21.058 align:start position:0%
repeat Baileys and violent arrests so I
 
07:25:22.250 --> 07:25:22.260 align:start position:0%
don't need to probably with this
 
07:25:23.990 --> 07:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
committee explain what PR bail or
 
07:25:25.548 --> 07:25:25.558 align:start position:0%
cashless bail is I'm sure you all know
 
07:25:27.650 --> 07:25:27.660 align:start position:0%
what it is but I'd like to start off
 
07:25:30.610 --> 07:25:30.620 align:start position:0%
this Committee hearing with two numbers
 
07:25:35.208 --> 07:25:35.218 align:start position:0%
uh the first one is eight eight uh eight
 
07:25:37.310 --> 07:25:37.320 align:start position:0%
is the number of times my constituent
 
07:25:40.730 --> 07:25:40.740 align:start position:0%
Daniel Whitmore was stabbed to death by
 
07:25:43.670 --> 07:25:43.680 align:start position:0%
a man who was out on double PR bail so
 
07:25:46.670 --> 07:25:46.680 align:start position:0%
let's talk about Mr Whitmore Mr Whitmore
 
07:25:49.548 --> 07:25:49.558 align:start position:0%
was a resident of Manchester ward 8. he
 
07:25:51.410 --> 07:25:51.420 align:start position:0%
was out at 10 30 in the morning on
 
07:25:54.410 --> 07:25:54.420 align:start position:0%
Friday out by nut Pawn in Ward 9 which I
 
07:25:57.350 --> 07:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
also represent he was a 75-year resident
 
07:26:00.170 --> 07:26:00.180 align:start position:0%
of the Queen City a veteran of the Armed
 
07:26:04.010 --> 07:26:04.020 align:start position:0%
Forces and on his walk down nut Pond he
 
07:26:06.948 --> 07:26:06.958 align:start position:0%
met a homeless man from Mississippi who
 
07:26:09.048 --> 07:26:09.058 align:start position:0%
had been arrest tested twice before and
 
07:26:10.910 --> 07:26:10.920 align:start position:0%
this man stabbed him to death eight
 
07:26:10.920 --> 07:26:12.170 align:start position:0%
this man stabbed him to death eight
times

07:26:12.170 --> 07:26:12.180 align:start position:0%
times
 
07:26:14.690 --> 07:26:14.700 align:start position:0%
that's relevant because this man was
 
07:26:18.430 --> 07:26:18.440 align:start position:0%
arrested recently before in Nashua for
 
07:26:21.590 --> 07:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
resisting an altercation he had with the
 
07:26:22.968 --> 07:26:22.978 align:start position:0%
police a violent altercation he had with
 
07:26:25.250 --> 07:26:25.260 align:start position:0%
the police but he was out on bail on
 
07:26:28.010 --> 07:26:28.020 align:start position:0%
cashless PR bail before that for
 
07:26:29.930 --> 07:26:29.940 align:start position:0%
threatening to stab someone
 
07:26:32.690 --> 07:26:32.700 align:start position:0%
so he was out on PR bail for threatening
 
07:26:35.330 --> 07:26:35.340 align:start position:0%
to stab someone and then he stabbed
 
07:26:38.330 --> 07:26:38.340 align:start position:0%
someone to death eight times in Cold
 
07:26:40.190 --> 07:26:40.200 align:start position:0%
Blood he then ran to the Walmart on Gold
 
07:26:42.468 --> 07:26:42.478 align:start position:0%
Street traumatized God knows how many
 
07:26:44.270 --> 07:26:44.280 align:start position:0%
children covered in his victim's blood
 
07:26:46.670 --> 07:26:46.680 align:start position:0%
so if you don't think we have a PR bail
 
07:26:49.270 --> 07:26:49.280 align:start position:0%
problem we have a PR bail problem
 
07:26:52.310 --> 07:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
the other number is 700. you've heard
 
07:26:55.250 --> 07:26:55.260 align:start position:0%
this number before 700 is the number of
 
07:26:57.830 --> 07:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
arrests in the last year in Manchester
 
07:27:01.968 --> 07:27:01.978 align:start position:0%
alone for people who were already out on
 
07:27:03.770 --> 07:27:03.780 align:start position:0%
Pay on bail
 
07:27:06.170 --> 07:27:06.180 align:start position:0%
we have a serious problem
 
07:27:08.570 --> 07:27:08.580 align:start position:0%
the language you have in front of you is
 
07:27:11.810 --> 07:27:11.820 align:start position:0%
the result of the product of last year's
 
07:27:13.610 --> 07:27:13.620 align:start position:0%
work so the bill that sailed through the
 
07:27:17.030 --> 07:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
house two to one the Senate modified and
 
07:27:19.190 --> 07:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
it died in Committee of conference
 
07:27:21.948 --> 07:27:21.958 align:start position:0%
effectively due to a drafting error so
 
07:27:24.170 --> 07:27:24.180 align:start position:0%
you have it passed it passed Committee
 
07:27:25.968 --> 07:27:25.978 align:start position:0%
of conference but it died to a drafting
 
07:27:28.968 --> 07:27:28.978 align:start position:0%
error so here we have the hopefully
 
07:27:30.890 --> 07:27:30.900 align:start position:0%
corrected language
 
07:27:30.900 --> 07:27:31.490 align:start position:0%
corrected language
um

07:27:31.490 --> 07:27:31.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:27:34.610 --> 07:27:34.620 align:start position:0%
uh something needs to be done
 
07:27:37.610 --> 07:27:37.620 align:start position:0%
people cannot wait anymore it's not just
 
07:27:41.090 --> 07:27:41.100 align:start position:0%
a Manchester problem uh it is a problem
 
07:27:42.830 --> 07:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
throughout the state it obviously
 
07:27:45.048 --> 07:27:45.058 align:start position:0%
impacts Manchester disproportionately
 
07:27:47.150 --> 07:27:47.160 align:start position:0%
given that we are the state's largest
 
07:27:49.910 --> 07:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
city and we have the county jail
 
07:27:51.770 --> 07:27:51.780 align:start position:0%
um in our city
 
07:27:51.780 --> 07:27:52.368 align:start position:0%
um in our city
um

07:27:52.368 --> 07:27:52.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:27:54.830 --> 07:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
it's very straightforward there are
 
07:27:57.650 --> 07:27:57.660 align:start position:0%
certain crimes that are listed I'm happy
 
07:27:59.090 --> 07:27:59.100 align:start position:0%
to kill it through some of them if you
 
07:28:01.610 --> 07:28:01.620 align:start position:0%
think people should be given cashless
 
07:28:03.948 --> 07:28:03.958 align:start position:0%
bail for the distribution of child
 
07:28:06.110 --> 07:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
sexual abuse images
 
07:28:09.288 --> 07:28:09.298 align:start position:0%
um good on you I disagree and the other
 
07:28:10.910 --> 07:28:10.920 align:start position:0%
part of obviously is if you're already
 
07:28:13.430 --> 07:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
out on bail you will not be given cash
 
07:28:15.948 --> 07:28:15.958 align:start position:0%
bail cashless bail again you will see a
 
07:28:18.410 --> 07:28:18.420 align:start position:0%
judge the judge May issue you a bail for
 
07:28:20.628 --> 07:28:20.638 align:start position:0%
a penny that's the judge's business but
 
07:28:21.708 --> 07:28:21.718 align:start position:0%
you're not going to be walking out
 
07:28:21.718 --> 07:28:23.090 align:start position:0%
you're not going to be walking out
scot-free

07:28:23.090 --> 07:28:23.100 align:start position:0%
scot-free
 
07:28:26.510 --> 07:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
the state has a compelling interest to
 
07:28:28.128 --> 07:28:28.138 align:start position:0%
protect the community
 
07:28:31.250 --> 07:28:31.260 align:start position:0%
we must balance that with people's
 
07:28:32.570 --> 07:28:32.580 align:start position:0%
rights that they are innocent until
 
07:28:35.750 --> 07:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
proven guilty but bail is not just about
 
07:28:38.208 --> 07:28:38.218 align:start position:0%
are you going to show up to trial
 
07:28:40.310 --> 07:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
there is a compelling State interest to
 
07:28:42.590 --> 07:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
protect the community so that's what
 
07:28:44.208 --> 07:28:44.218 align:start position:0%
this is trying to do it's trying to find
 
07:28:46.670 --> 07:28:46.680 align:start position:0%
that middle ground of how do we respect
 
07:28:48.770 --> 07:28:48.780 align:start position:0%
what are the good parts of PR bail right
 
07:28:51.350 --> 07:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
because the good parts of PR bail is we
 
07:28:53.570 --> 07:28:53.580 align:start position:0%
do not want to hold poor or Indigent
 
07:28:53.580 --> 07:28:54.490 align:start position:0%
do not want to hold poor or Indigent
people

07:28:54.490 --> 07:28:54.500 align:start position:0%
people
 
07:28:57.530 --> 07:28:57.540 align:start position:0%
in jail for low-level crimes that they
 
07:28:58.968 --> 07:28:58.978 align:start position:0%
may not have committed right we could
 
07:29:01.070 --> 07:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
probably actually all agree on that but
 
07:29:02.448 --> 07:29:02.458 align:start position:0%
when you start com you start getting
 
07:29:05.270 --> 07:29:05.280 align:start position:0%
accused of certain serious crimes or
 
07:29:07.070 --> 07:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
you're being arrested repeatedly in a
 
07:29:08.990 --> 07:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
short period of time we have to take a
 
07:29:11.628 --> 07:29:11.638 align:start position:0%
better look for you and PR bail is not
 
07:29:13.968 --> 07:29:13.978 align:start position:0%
the appropriate solution
 
07:29:16.430 --> 07:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
I I gave an interview the other day and
 
07:29:18.048 --> 07:29:18.058 align:start position:0%
I said I hate to be that guy but people
 
07:29:23.090 --> 07:29:23.100 align:start position:0%
are literally dying uh it's was really
 
07:29:25.788 --> 07:29:25.798 align:start position:0%
um upsetting to me that
 
07:29:29.270 --> 07:29:29.280 align:start position:0%
it was my constituent and we had a
 
07:29:29.280 --> 07:29:30.288 align:start position:0%
it was my constituent and we had a
meeting

07:29:30.288 --> 07:29:30.298 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
07:29:32.330 --> 07:29:32.340 align:start position:0%
um we had a safety meeting in ward 9.
 
07:29:35.510 --> 07:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
and we got up there and of course you
 
07:29:36.830 --> 07:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
know people are playing politics and
 
07:29:38.270 --> 07:29:38.280 align:start position:0%
trying to pass the blame and I got out
 
07:29:39.708 --> 07:29:39.718 align:start position:0%
there and I said no this is actually the
 
07:29:41.448 --> 07:29:41.458 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire's fault Mr
 
07:29:44.150 --> 07:29:44.160 align:start position:0%
Whitmore would have been alive had this
 
07:29:47.448 --> 07:29:47.458 align:start position:0%
been in law that man would have not been
 
07:29:49.310 --> 07:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
out on double PR bail
 
07:29:49.320 --> 07:29:50.208 align:start position:0%
out on double PR bail
um

07:29:50.208 --> 07:29:50.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:29:53.270 --> 07:29:53.280 align:start position:0%
he'd be alive today so this is a serious
 
07:29:56.750 --> 07:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
problem I respect those of you who
 
07:29:58.910 --> 07:29:58.920 align:start position:0%
support the concept of PR bail I try to
 
07:29:58.920 --> 07:30:00.110 align:start position:0%
support the concept of PR bail I try to
protect

07:30:00.110 --> 07:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
protect
 
07:30:01.850 --> 07:30:01.860 align:start position:0%
the core principle that we can all agree
 
07:30:04.310 --> 07:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
in but balance in the issue of the
 
07:30:06.468 --> 07:30:06.478 align:start position:0%
safety of the community and I would be
 
07:30:08.208 --> 07:30:08.218 align:start position:0%
stunned if there weren't questions so
 
07:30:08.218 --> 07:30:11.390 align:start position:0%
stunned if there weren't questions so
oops

07:30:11.390 --> 07:30:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
07:30:15.230 --> 07:30:15.240 align:start position:0%
so we were so close representative Muse
 
07:30:17.030 --> 07:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
representative news you recognize ask
 
07:30:19.190 --> 07:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
your question thank you um uh you
 
07:30:21.048 --> 07:30:21.058 align:start position:0%
mentioned that your current bill is very
 
07:30:23.750 --> 07:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
close to HB 1476
 
07:30:25.670 --> 07:30:25.680 align:start position:0%
um and I do know that there were there
 
07:30:27.350 --> 07:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
were issues with the bill at the end
 
07:30:28.910 --> 07:30:28.920 align:start position:0%
which is one of the reasons it didn't go
 
07:30:31.190 --> 07:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
over the goal line are there are there
 
07:30:34.850 --> 07:30:34.860 align:start position:0%
any differences between the bill
 
07:30:38.208 --> 07:30:38.218 align:start position:0%
um that is in front of us now and uh
 
07:30:40.968 --> 07:30:40.978 align:start position:0%
1476 the last time we saw it in the
 
07:30:40.978 --> 07:30:42.830 align:start position:0%
1476 the last time we saw it in the
house

07:30:42.830 --> 07:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
house
 
07:30:44.810 --> 07:30:44.820 align:start position:0%
um it's very similar it did get amended
 
07:30:47.510 --> 07:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
and 1476 to get amended so we brought
 
07:30:50.090 --> 07:30:50.100 align:start position:0%
back this is basically the hybrid of the
 
07:30:52.730 --> 07:30:52.740 align:start position:0%
original 1476 and the hybrid of the
 
07:30:55.628 --> 07:30:55.638 align:start position:0%
original uh Senate package
 
07:30:58.310 --> 07:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
this is a two this is arrested on second
 
07:31:00.708 --> 07:31:00.718 align:start position:0%
for all offenses one of the compliments
 
07:31:02.330 --> 07:31:02.340 align:start position:0%
prizes last time was we dropped it down
 
07:31:03.890 --> 07:31:03.900 align:start position:0%
to three arrests for class B
 
07:31:06.410 --> 07:31:06.420 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors uh I have since pulled that
 
07:31:08.030 --> 07:31:08.040 align:start position:0%
off of the table given that one of my
 
07:31:11.090 --> 07:31:11.100 align:start position:0%
constituents was murdered so
 
07:31:13.730 --> 07:31:13.740 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm sorry I'm not sorry about that
 
07:31:15.590 --> 07:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
but I I pulled that off that was a
 
07:31:17.628 --> 07:31:17.638 align:start position:0%
concession we gave honestly I don't
 
07:31:19.128 --> 07:31:19.138 align:start position:0%
believe it got us any more votes than it
 
07:31:21.288 --> 07:31:21.298 align:start position:0%
would have originally so I didn't feel
 
07:31:25.330 --> 07:31:25.340 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:27.890 --> 07:31:27.900 align:start position:0%
representative Newman
 
07:31:30.048 --> 07:31:30.058 align:start position:0%
I don't want to see you be stunned so we
 
07:31:32.330 --> 07:31:32.340 align:start position:0%
got two questions
 
07:31:32.340 --> 07:31:34.190 align:start position:0%
got two questions
um

07:31:34.190 --> 07:31:34.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:31:36.288 --> 07:31:36.298 align:start position:0%
um in in the particular case that you
 
07:31:36.298 --> 07:31:37.788 align:start position:0%
um in in the particular case that you
mentioned

07:31:37.788 --> 07:31:37.798 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
07:31:40.310 --> 07:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
um was the person was that it was the
 
07:31:42.830 --> 07:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
case that he got uh didn't have bail on
 
07:31:44.390 --> 07:31:44.400 align:start position:0%
and the first one was that adjudicated
 
07:31:46.490 --> 07:31:46.500 align:start position:0%
was he convicted of that or was just it
 
07:31:48.650 --> 07:31:48.660 align:start position:0%
was just a charge and the second was
 
07:31:50.990 --> 07:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
also was just a charge is that the
 
07:31:52.730 --> 07:31:52.740 align:start position:0%
correct correct he was charged with
 
07:31:55.368 --> 07:31:55.378 align:start position:0%
threatening to stab someone and fighting
 
07:31:57.948 --> 07:31:57.958 align:start position:0%
a police officer okay but he was charged
 
07:32:00.410 --> 07:32:00.420 align:start position:0%
thank you correct and he was out on
 
07:32:02.868 --> 07:32:02.878 align:start position:0%
cashless bail and so now on the second
 
07:32:05.090 --> 07:32:05.100 align:start position:0%
one he was just charged oh sorry
 
07:32:05.100 --> 07:32:08.270 align:start position:0%
one he was just charged oh sorry
follow-ups

07:32:08.270 --> 07:32:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:32:11.390 --> 07:32:11.400 align:start position:0%
I was trying to hurry
 
07:32:13.850 --> 07:32:13.860 align:start position:0%
correct and I I appreciate the the
 
07:32:15.410 --> 07:32:15.420 align:start position:0%
underlying what you're trying to get to
 
07:32:16.788 --> 07:32:16.798 align:start position:0%
the underlying concept it hasn't been
 
07:32:17.990 --> 07:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
proven guilty right that's what you're
 
07:32:19.730 --> 07:32:19.740 align:start position:0%
trying that's what you're I love to do
 
07:32:21.288 --> 07:32:21.298 align:start position:0%
that in election law too so I appreciate
 
07:32:21.298 --> 07:32:22.190 align:start position:0%
that in election law too so I appreciate
it

07:32:22.190 --> 07:32:22.200 align:start position:0%
it
 
07:32:22.200 --> 07:32:23.030 align:start position:0%
it
um

07:32:23.030 --> 07:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:32:24.770 --> 07:32:24.780 align:start position:0%
once again there's a compelling State
 
07:32:27.468 --> 07:32:27.478 align:start position:0%
entrance to balance the right of of
 
07:32:29.810 --> 07:32:29.820 align:start position:0%
pre-trial offended a pre-trial the
 
07:32:31.910 --> 07:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
accused pre-trial right with the safety
 
07:32:33.468 --> 07:32:33.478 align:start position:0%
of the community
 
07:32:35.090 --> 07:32:35.100 align:start position:0%
I don't think anybody up here would
 
07:32:37.490 --> 07:32:37.500 align:start position:0%
think that we hit the balancing act with
 
07:32:42.770 --> 07:32:42.780 align:start position:0%
 
07:32:46.910 --> 07:32:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:32:48.110 --> 07:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
thank you representative actually
 
07:32:49.850 --> 07:32:49.860 align:start position:0%
relatively short all right cool this is
 
07:32:51.170 --> 07:32:51.180 align:start position:0%
the benefit of a four o'clock hearing
 
07:32:53.868 --> 07:32:53.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:09.368 --> 07:33:09.378 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:11.810 --> 07:33:11.820 align:start position:0%
good afternoon again Madam chair thank
 
07:33:14.510 --> 07:33:14.520 align:start position:0%
you my name is John burfonski I am the
 
07:33:16.128 --> 07:33:16.138 align:start position:0%
chief of police in Bedford and
 
07:33:18.048 --> 07:33:18.058 align:start position:0%
representing the New Hampshire
 
07:33:20.270 --> 07:33:20.280 align:start position:0%
Association of chiefs of police more
 
07:33:21.708 --> 07:33:21.718 align:start position:0%
than 150 Chiefs throughout the grand
 
07:33:23.448 --> 07:33:23.458 align:start position:0%
estate and under President of the Chiefs
 
07:33:25.490 --> 07:33:25.500 align:start position:0%
Association this year the Chiefs
 
07:33:28.850 --> 07:33:28.860 align:start position:0%
Association is staunchly in support of
 
07:33:31.010 --> 07:33:31.020 align:start position:0%
this uh Common Sense bail Reform Bill
 
07:33:35.090 --> 07:33:35.100 align:start position:0%
that would require a decision by a judge
 
07:33:37.368 --> 07:33:37.378 align:start position:0%
instead of a bail commissioner for the
 
07:33:39.410 --> 07:33:39.420 align:start position:0%
most serious violent crimes that occur
 
07:33:42.110 --> 07:33:42.120 align:start position:0%
and are committed in the state of New
 
07:33:42.120 --> 07:33:42.910 align:start position:0%
and are committed in the state of New
Hampshire

07:33:42.910 --> 07:33:42.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
07:33:46.570 --> 07:33:46.580 align:start position:0%
the recent data shows that unfortunately
 
07:33:48.948 --> 07:33:48.958 align:start position:0%
2022 was the most deadly year for
 
07:33:50.448 --> 07:33:50.458 align:start position:0%
homicides in the state of New Hampshire
 
07:33:54.468 --> 07:33:54.478 align:start position:0%
since 2002 so if we are to remain one of
 
07:33:56.628 --> 07:33:56.638 align:start position:0%
the safest states in the state in the
 
07:33:59.390 --> 07:33:59.400 align:start position:0%
United States then we need to make some
 
07:34:02.690 --> 07:34:02.700 align:start position:0%
common sense bail reform that speaks to
 
07:34:04.788 --> 07:34:04.798 align:start position:0%
the issues that the sponsor just brought
 
07:34:06.310 --> 07:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
up there is not a week that goes by
 
07:34:08.330 --> 07:34:08.340 align:start position:0%
ladies and gentlemen that there's not a
 
07:34:10.490 --> 07:34:10.500 align:start position:0%
case that comes up in which an
 
07:34:13.010 --> 07:34:13.020 align:start position:0%
individual who was repeatedly arrested
 
07:34:15.530 --> 07:34:15.540 align:start position:0%
and released and then goes on to commit
 
07:34:18.410 --> 07:34:18.420 align:start position:0%
another serious crime if you query the
 
07:34:20.030 --> 07:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
online digital version of the union
 
07:34:22.610 --> 07:34:22.620 align:start position:0%
leader today you'll see a case again in
 
07:34:24.830 --> 07:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
Manchester of an individual who was
 
07:34:28.368 --> 07:34:28.378 align:start position:0%
arrested after repeated release from
 
07:34:30.410 --> 07:34:30.420 align:start position:0%
arrest and released on his own
 
07:34:33.350 --> 07:34:33.360 align:start position:0%
recognizance on a Saturday on a Tuesday
 
07:34:35.868 --> 07:34:35.878 align:start position:0%
and on the Saturday he conducts a
 
07:34:38.510 --> 07:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
robbery completes the robbery and then
 
07:34:40.368 --> 07:34:40.378 align:start position:0%
leads the police on a chase and crashes
 
07:34:42.708 --> 07:34:42.718 align:start position:0%
his car which obviously imperils the
 
07:34:45.530 --> 07:34:45.540 align:start position:0%
city of Manchester the residents as well
 
07:34:47.868 --> 07:34:47.878 align:start position:0%
as the police officers involved this is
 
07:34:49.930 --> 07:34:49.940 align:start position:0%
a common sense
 
07:34:53.930 --> 07:34:53.940 align:start position:0%
fine-tuned strategical change to the
 
07:34:56.930 --> 07:34:56.940 align:start position:0%
current bail law here in the state of
 
07:34:59.330 --> 07:34:59.340 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire this is not going to
 
07:35:01.448 --> 07:35:01.458 align:start position:0%
result in mass incarceration that's
 
07:35:05.030 --> 07:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
hyperbole used by people that fear
 
07:35:07.730 --> 07:35:07.740 align:start position:0%
Monger frankly the effects of this
 
07:35:09.468 --> 07:35:09.478 align:start position:0%
particular build is not no evidence to
 
07:35:12.890 --> 07:35:12.900 align:start position:0%
suggest thankfully because we don't have
 
07:35:16.610 --> 07:35:16.620 align:start position:0%
a significant violent crime problem in
 
07:35:17.750 --> 07:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire that this
 
07:35:20.510 --> 07:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
would result in mass incarceration this
 
07:35:22.910 --> 07:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
simply places the initial decision for
 
07:35:24.890 --> 07:35:24.900 align:start position:0%
bail not in the hands of a bail
 
07:35:26.390 --> 07:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner at two o'clock in the
 
07:35:28.610 --> 07:35:28.620 align:start position:0%
morning in a police station with scanty
 
07:35:30.708 --> 07:35:30.718 align:start position:0%
information about the background the
 
07:35:33.170 --> 07:35:33.180 align:start position:0%
history and the nuances involving the
 
07:35:36.288 --> 07:35:36.298 align:start position:0%
particular case and moves it before a
 
07:35:38.750 --> 07:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
judge in Superior Court that allows the
 
07:35:40.968 --> 07:35:40.978 align:start position:0%
defendant as well as the prosecuting
 
07:35:43.610 --> 07:35:43.620 align:start position:0%
attorney to bring forth the information
 
07:35:45.770 --> 07:35:45.780 align:start position:0%
necessary to allow an independent
 
07:35:47.990 --> 07:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
neutral judge to make the appropriate
 
07:35:50.650 --> 07:35:50.660 align:start position:0%
decision with respect to bail
 
07:35:52.850 --> 07:35:52.860 align:start position:0%
that's the place where those decisions
 
07:35:54.708 --> 07:35:54.718 align:start position:0%
should be made and of course in this
 
07:35:54.718 --> 07:35:55.750 align:start position:0%
should be made and of course in this
particular

07:35:55.750 --> 07:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
particular
 
07:35:58.368 --> 07:35:58.378 align:start position:0%
statute as proposed it would require the
 
07:36:01.250 --> 07:36:01.260 align:start position:0%
judge to use clear and convincing
 
07:36:02.930 --> 07:36:02.940 align:start position:0%
evidence which is a high standard just
 
07:36:04.490 --> 07:36:04.500 align:start position:0%
below proof Beyond a reasonable cause
 
07:36:06.948 --> 07:36:06.958 align:start position:0%
reasonable Reasonable Doubt rather that
 
07:36:09.110 --> 07:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
an individual would continue would be a
 
07:36:11.990 --> 07:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
danger to the community so we strongly
 
07:36:14.390 --> 07:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
strongly support in the interest of the
 
07:36:16.968 --> 07:36:16.978 align:start position:0%
victims of crime those people who can't
 
07:36:19.128 --> 07:36:19.138 align:start position:0%
speak for themselves anymore because
 
07:36:21.890 --> 07:36:21.900 align:start position:0%
they're not here with us had this
 
07:36:24.650 --> 07:36:24.660 align:start position:0%
particular law been changed and these
 
07:36:29.230 --> 07:36:29.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:36:33.530 --> 07:36:33.540 align:start position:0%
 
07:36:36.410 --> 07:36:36.420 align:start position:0%
 
07:36:38.590 --> 07:36:38.600 align:start position:0%
one of the things that has always
 
07:36:40.548 --> 07:36:40.558 align:start position:0%
confused me a bit and I know it's
 
07:36:42.730 --> 07:36:42.740 align:start position:0%
confused other people when it comes to
 
07:36:45.590 --> 07:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh to bills like this
 
07:36:49.310 --> 07:36:49.320 align:start position:0%
um is the fact that our current bail law
 
07:36:50.510 --> 07:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
um actually
 
07:36:53.270 --> 07:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
does seem to allow people uh who are
 
07:36:55.968 --> 07:36:55.978 align:start position:0%
dangerous to be held and one of the
 
07:36:57.708 --> 07:36:57.718 align:start position:0%
things that we've heard in other other
 
07:36:57.718 --> 07:36:59.288 align:start position:0%
things that we've heard in other other
hearings

07:36:59.288 --> 07:36:59.298 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
07:37:03.830 --> 07:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
is that the issue is less a problem with
 
07:37:06.708 --> 07:37:06.718 align:start position:0%
our current bail law than it is with
 
07:37:08.990 --> 07:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
consistency of training the availability
 
07:37:11.570 --> 07:37:11.580 align:start position:0%
of prosecutors to make decisions on
 
07:37:14.770 --> 07:37:14.780 align:start position:0%
second bail requests
 
07:37:18.410 --> 07:37:18.420 align:start position:0%
improper or inadequate training of bail
 
07:37:21.410 --> 07:37:21.420 align:start position:0%
Commissioners so when we talk about the
 
07:37:23.990 --> 07:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
balance I'm I'm curious about your
 
07:37:26.090 --> 07:37:26.100 align:start position:0%
opinion on this on the one hand we have
 
07:37:27.830 --> 07:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
the constitutional rights of people who
 
07:37:30.170 --> 07:37:30.180 align:start position:0%
are accused of crimes and we have what
 
07:37:33.590 --> 07:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
appears to be a breakdown in the system
 
07:37:35.170 --> 07:37:35.180 align:start position:0%
um how do
 
07:37:38.270 --> 07:37:38.280 align:start position:0%
is this type of change in the law in
 
07:37:40.910 --> 07:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
your opinion the best way to balance
 
07:37:40.920 --> 07:37:42.128 align:start position:0%
your opinion the best way to balance
this

07:37:42.128 --> 07:37:42.138 align:start position:0%
this
 
07:37:44.330 --> 07:37:44.340 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh
 
07:37:44.340 --> 07:37:45.468 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh
representative

07:37:45.468 --> 07:37:45.478 align:start position:0%
representative
 
07:37:49.548 --> 07:37:49.558 align:start position:0%
um I I sit here before you with a lot of
 
07:37:52.010 --> 07:37:52.020 align:start position:0%
gray hair after 45 years of continuous
 
07:37:53.510 --> 07:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
law enforcement service
 
07:37:55.910 --> 07:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
and one thing that I'll tell you with
 
07:37:57.770 --> 07:37:57.780 align:start position:0%
respect to just about any Bill and any
 
07:38:00.288 --> 07:38:00.298 align:start position:0%
law that comes before me the association
 
07:38:04.310 --> 07:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
or you is to look at it in with a
 
07:38:06.288 --> 07:38:06.298 align:start position:0%
perspective of Common Sense
 
07:38:08.270 --> 07:38:08.280 align:start position:0%
what would your constituent on their
 
07:38:11.090 --> 07:38:11.100 align:start position:0%
front porch in the afternoon ask the
 
07:38:13.310 --> 07:38:13.320 align:start position:0%
question should a person who just shot
 
07:38:16.010 --> 07:38:16.020 align:start position:0%
up the streets of Manchester be released
 
07:38:18.288 --> 07:38:18.298 align:start position:0%
on a on a cashless bail
 
07:38:21.708 --> 07:38:21.718 align:start position:0%
by a bail commissioner I would venture
 
07:38:23.570 --> 07:38:23.580 align:start position:0%
to say that your constituent would tell
 
07:38:27.650 --> 07:38:27.660 align:start position:0%
you no the common sense notion here is
 
07:38:29.690 --> 07:38:29.700 align:start position:0%
that people that pose a danger to the
 
07:38:31.730 --> 07:38:31.740 align:start position:0%
community that commit the most violent
 
07:38:33.468 --> 07:38:33.478 align:start position:0%
crimes that the state of New Hampshire
 
07:38:35.570 --> 07:38:35.580 align:start position:0%
has on its books should not be
 
07:38:37.670 --> 07:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
immediately released until there's a
 
07:38:39.890 --> 07:38:39.900 align:start position:0%
more deliberate review of what is
 
07:38:42.048 --> 07:38:42.058 align:start position:0%
involved in a particular case let the
 
07:38:44.990 --> 07:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
Judge review let the balance of time the
 
07:38:47.628 --> 07:38:47.638 align:start position:0%
defense bring forth whatever information
 
07:38:51.708 --> 07:38:51.718 align:start position:0%
that they may conjure up to encourage
 
07:38:53.750 --> 07:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
the judge to release the individual or
 
07:38:55.730 --> 07:38:55.740 align:start position:0%
to make a finding that the person is not
 
07:38:57.230 --> 07:38:57.240 align:start position:0%
a danger to the community
 
07:39:00.048 --> 07:39:00.058 align:start position:0%
I urge you to use common sense
 
07:39:03.468 --> 07:39:03.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:39:05.750 --> 07:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
representative Newman
 
07:39:07.850 --> 07:39:07.860 align:start position:0%
just to follow on up on that with the
 
07:39:10.610 --> 07:39:10.620 align:start position:0%
common sense the thing that gets to me
 
07:39:10.620 --> 07:39:11.690 align:start position:0%
common sense the thing that gets to me
is

07:39:11.690 --> 07:39:11.700 align:start position:0%
is
 
07:39:14.628 --> 07:39:14.638 align:start position:0%
have there been any judges that have
 
07:39:16.788 --> 07:39:16.798 align:start position:0%
released people on uh personal
 
07:39:18.650 --> 07:39:18.660 align:start position:0%
recognizance bail and then it's been
 
07:39:20.390 --> 07:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
followed up by
 
07:39:22.850 --> 07:39:22.860 align:start position:0%
by a crime being committed and then is
 
07:39:25.250 --> 07:39:25.260 align:start position:0%
is that why we're waiting for the judges
 
07:39:26.810 --> 07:39:26.820 align:start position:0%
to make the decision as opposed to the
 
07:39:28.850 --> 07:39:28.860 align:start position:0%
bail commissions that both have to
 
07:39:31.610 --> 07:39:31.620 align:start position:0%
follow the same standards
 
07:39:33.410 --> 07:39:33.420 align:start position:0%
there had been so the answers to your
 
07:39:34.730 --> 07:39:34.740 align:start position:0%
question yes there have been instances
 
07:39:36.230 --> 07:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
where judges have released I believe
 
07:39:38.930 --> 07:39:38.940 align:start position:0%
that the the case that the sponsor
 
07:39:41.150 --> 07:39:41.160 align:start position:0%
brought up with respect to um his
 
07:39:42.770 --> 07:39:42.780 align:start position:0%
constituent that was killed involved a
 
07:39:44.448 --> 07:39:44.458 align:start position:0%
judge's decision to release someone on
 
07:39:47.270 --> 07:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
on a cashless or uh release on their own
 
07:39:49.730 --> 07:39:49.740 align:start position:0%
recognizance so yes
 
07:39:51.770 --> 07:39:51.780 align:start position:0%
um but we also have countless numbers of
 
07:39:54.830 --> 07:39:54.840 align:start position:0%
of instances right involving bail
 
07:39:57.708 --> 07:39:57.718 align:start position:0%
Commissioners that release people if the
 
07:40:00.590 --> 07:40:00.600 align:start position:0%
judge makes a wrongful decision that
 
07:40:02.390 --> 07:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
results in the death of an individual
 
07:40:02.400 --> 07:40:04.010 align:start position:0%
results in the death of an individual
right

07:40:04.010 --> 07:40:04.020 align:start position:0%
right
 
07:40:04.020 --> 07:40:04.850 align:start position:0%
right
um

07:40:04.850 --> 07:40:04.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:40:08.628 --> 07:40:08.638 align:start position:0%
there there should be some Reckoning uh
 
07:40:11.628 --> 07:40:11.638 align:start position:0%
of the judge's decision what Reckoning
 
07:40:13.310 --> 07:40:13.320 align:start position:0%
could take place
 
07:40:16.250 --> 07:40:16.260 align:start position:0%
whether it's uh simply
 
07:40:16.260 --> 07:40:17.030 align:start position:0%
whether it's uh simply
um

07:40:17.030 --> 07:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:40:19.310 --> 07:40:19.320 align:start position:0%
bringing forth information to the judge
 
07:40:22.070 --> 07:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
in camera with respect to the the
 
07:40:24.650 --> 07:40:24.660 align:start position:0%
results I'm sure every single judge
 
07:40:26.150 --> 07:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
the judges that I know both in the
 
07:40:28.490 --> 07:40:28.500 align:start position:0%
federal and state side are fully aware
 
07:40:31.510 --> 07:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
of the mistakes perhaps that they make
 
07:40:34.610 --> 07:40:34.620 align:start position:0%
and I think that they'll say that they
 
07:40:36.230 --> 07:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
made the decision based on the best
 
07:40:37.910 --> 07:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
information or the law that they had
 
07:40:39.110 --> 07:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
before them
 
07:40:41.390 --> 07:40:41.400 align:start position:0%
this provides for clear and convincing
 
07:40:44.750 --> 07:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
evidence and again the common sense test
 
07:40:45.830 --> 07:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
would be
 
07:40:47.750 --> 07:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
if a person just shot up the streets of
 
07:40:49.490 --> 07:40:49.500 align:start position:0%
Manchester should that person be
 
07:40:52.610 --> 07:40:52.620 align:start position:0%
released or if that person threatened to
 
07:40:55.070 --> 07:40:55.080 align:start position:0%
stab someone and assaulted a police
 
07:40:57.170 --> 07:40:57.180 align:start position:0%
officer should that person be released
 
07:41:01.548 --> 07:41:01.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:41:01.558 --> 07:41:03.110 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

07:41:03.110 --> 07:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
07:41:04.968 --> 07:41:04.978 align:start position:0%
thank you and I wasn't meaning to demean
 
07:41:07.010 --> 07:41:07.020 align:start position:0%
the Judgment of the judge but but the
 
07:41:08.628 --> 07:41:08.638 align:start position:0%
bail Commissioners are held to the same
 
07:41:11.390 --> 07:41:11.400 align:start position:0%
standard so they would have the same
 
07:41:14.208 --> 07:41:14.218 align:start position:0%
Reckoning so I just don't see why this
 
07:41:16.850 --> 07:41:16.860 align:start position:0%
law that puts all these bills
 
07:41:19.250 --> 07:41:19.260 align:start position:0%
makes a difference well it makes a
 
07:41:21.948 --> 07:41:21.958 align:start position:0%
difference uh representative because uh
 
07:41:24.350 --> 07:41:24.360 align:start position:0%
it it takes the decision out of the
 
07:41:26.030 --> 07:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
hands of the bail commissioner where
 
07:41:28.070 --> 07:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
there have been a number many many cases
 
07:41:29.330 --> 07:41:29.340 align:start position:0%
in which the bail Commissioners have
 
07:41:30.830 --> 07:41:30.840 align:start position:0%
released people
 
07:41:32.810 --> 07:41:32.820 align:start position:0%
um on their own recognition since
 
07:41:34.368 --> 07:41:34.378 align:start position:0%
um as they say two o'clock in the
 
07:41:36.110 --> 07:41:36.120 align:start position:0%
morning in a police station which is not
 
07:41:37.430 --> 07:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
the best place to make that decision
 
07:41:42.048 --> 07:41:42.058 align:start position:0%
 
07:41:46.610 --> 07:41:46.620 align:start position:0%
 
07:41:46.620 --> 07:41:53.930 align:start position:0%
 
humid

07:41:53.930 --> 07:41:53.940 align:start position:0%
 
07:41:55.930 --> 07:41:55.940 align:start position:0%
you just said that they do
 
07:42:00.948 --> 07:42:00.958 align:start position:0%
and the bill bill commissioner says
 
07:42:02.570 --> 07:42:02.580 align:start position:0%
um I really want to release that person
 
07:42:06.410 --> 07:42:06.420 align:start position:0%
with the officer you say no because this
 
07:42:09.288 --> 07:42:09.298 align:start position:0%
person is a danger to society okay don't
 
07:42:12.170 --> 07:42:12.180 align:start position:0%
we already have those laws in place
 
07:42:14.810 --> 07:42:14.820 align:start position:0%
to stop that person from getting bail
 
07:42:16.670 --> 07:42:16.680 align:start position:0%
the bail commissioner decision excuse me
 
07:42:18.170 --> 07:42:18.180 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry today
 
07:42:20.030 --> 07:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry that uh I'm sorry for
 
07:42:22.190 --> 07:42:22.200 align:start position:0%
interrupting the bail commissioner's
 
07:42:25.368 --> 07:42:25.378 align:start position:0%
decision is final I oftentimes and I do
 
07:42:28.730 --> 07:42:28.740 align:start position:0%
make sure that my patrol supervisors
 
07:42:31.070 --> 07:42:31.080 align:start position:0%
when there's a violent crime involved in
 
07:42:34.010 --> 07:42:34.020 align:start position:0%
Bedford that if they learned that the BC
 
07:42:35.270 --> 07:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
or the bail commissioner is going to
 
07:42:37.368 --> 07:42:37.378 align:start position:0%
release that individual on their own
 
07:42:40.190 --> 07:42:40.200 align:start position:0%
recognizance that they inquire with uh
 
07:42:41.750 --> 07:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
and plea and make the case with the bail
 
07:42:43.010 --> 07:42:43.020 align:start position:0%
commission but the bail commissioner's
 
07:42:45.770 --> 07:42:45.780 align:start position:0%
decision is final at that moment
 
07:42:45.780 --> 07:42:47.390 align:start position:0%
decision is final at that moment
yeah

07:42:47.390 --> 07:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
07:42:49.730 --> 07:42:49.740 align:start position:0%
so what is your recourse at that point
 
07:42:52.548 --> 07:42:52.558 align:start position:0%
if the bail commissioner says um you
 
07:42:52.558 --> 07:42:53.150 align:start position:0%
if the bail commissioner says um you
know

07:42:53.150 --> 07:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
know
 
07:42:55.128 --> 07:42:55.138 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry we're going to give them that
 
07:42:55.138 --> 07:42:56.030 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry we're going to give them that
bail

07:42:56.030 --> 07:42:56.040 align:start position:0%
bail
 
07:42:58.788 --> 07:42:58.798 align:start position:0%
what requests do you have as an officer
 
07:43:01.010 --> 07:43:01.020 align:start position:0%
at that point we have none that person
 
07:43:12.230 --> 07:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:43:14.390 --> 07:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
by another chief of police that said
 
07:43:16.128 --> 07:43:16.138 align:start position:0%
there was that you do you do have a
 
07:43:18.350 --> 07:43:18.360 align:start position:0%
recourse and that you would contact I
 
07:43:19.910 --> 07:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
think it was a judge or someone you
 
07:43:23.090 --> 07:43:23.100 align:start position:0%
would contact under those conditions
 
07:43:25.788 --> 07:43:25.798 align:start position:0%
no I'm not aware of that and I would uh
 
07:43:27.410 --> 07:43:27.420 align:start position:0%
dispute that that would be a factual
 
07:43:29.750 --> 07:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
rendition once the bail commissioner
 
07:43:31.490 --> 07:43:31.500 align:start position:0%
makes that determination we can plead
 
07:43:32.868 --> 07:43:32.878 align:start position:0%
the case before the bail commissioner
 
07:43:36.650 --> 07:43:36.660 align:start position:0%
but unless there is a procedural error
 
07:43:40.190 --> 07:43:40.200 align:start position:0%
for example uh perhaps if the individual
 
07:43:43.670 --> 07:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
is being held on a warrant that uh
 
07:43:46.670 --> 07:43:46.680 align:start position:0%
requires no bail in other words if it's
 
07:43:48.590 --> 07:43:48.600 align:start position:0%
an electronic bench warrant that
 
07:43:49.968 --> 07:43:49.978 align:start position:0%
requires that individual to be
 
07:43:51.468 --> 07:43:51.478 align:start position:0%
incarcerated and the bail commissioner
 
07:43:53.690 --> 07:43:53.700 align:start position:0%
is going to release them right then
 
07:43:56.810 --> 07:43:56.820 align:start position:0%
perhaps that may be an instance that
 
07:44:00.350 --> 07:44:00.360 align:start position:0%
would fall in the contextual scenario
 
07:44:02.690 --> 07:44:02.700 align:start position:0%
that that Chief might be talking about
 
07:44:06.468 --> 07:44:06.478 align:start position:0%
but if if it's not a
 
07:44:09.230 --> 07:44:09.240 align:start position:0%
a warrant that requires incarceration
 
07:44:16.128 --> 07:44:16.138 align:start position:0%
 
07:44:16.138 --> 07:44:17.690 align:start position:0%
 
so

07:44:17.690 --> 07:44:17.700 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:44:19.310 --> 07:44:19.320 align:start position:0%
Chief as you're probably aware we have
 
07:44:21.650 --> 07:44:21.660 align:start position:0%
several of these different forms of
 
07:44:23.810 --> 07:44:23.820 align:start position:0%
these these bills that we'll be hearing
 
07:44:26.510 --> 07:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
and I one of the questions that our
 
07:44:28.548 --> 07:44:28.558 align:start position:0%
chairman asked and he's not here and I I
 
07:44:30.708 --> 07:44:30.718 align:start position:0%
think I would just like to kind of make
 
07:44:32.150 --> 07:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
sure that I heard the question right if
 
07:44:35.270 --> 07:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
I may he had asked that
 
07:44:36.890 --> 07:44:36.900 align:start position:0%
if a person
 
07:44:38.510 --> 07:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
the person does a crime in Manchester
 
07:44:39.890 --> 07:44:39.900 align:start position:0%
and they get it on bail and then they
 
07:44:42.048 --> 07:44:42.058 align:start position:0%
get in a car and they drive up to say
 
07:44:44.628 --> 07:44:44.638 align:start position:0%
Conway and they were to be arrested
 
07:44:47.270 --> 07:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
again that same night is there any kind
 
07:44:48.890 --> 07:44:48.900 align:start position:0%
of a system that would let a bill
 
07:44:51.288 --> 07:44:51.298 align:start position:0%
commissioner know that that person
 
07:44:54.530 --> 07:44:54.540 align:start position:0%
has just been released on bail
 
07:44:58.270 --> 07:44:58.280 align:start position:0%
uh no not uh not within that scenario uh
 
07:45:01.128 --> 07:45:01.138 align:start position:0%
if the individuals
 
07:45:04.850 --> 07:45:04.860 align:start position:0%
um arrested and then uh released and
 
07:45:07.190 --> 07:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
then within a short period of time is
 
07:45:09.590 --> 07:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
rearrested again on another independent
 
07:45:13.368 --> 07:45:13.378 align:start position:0%
charge uh it would take some time for
 
07:45:16.730 --> 07:45:16.740 align:start position:0%
that arrest to appear in the ncic uh
 
07:45:18.830 --> 07:45:18.840 align:start position:0%
Interstate identification index so when
 
07:45:21.948 --> 07:45:21.958 align:start position:0%
that Conway police officer runs the
 
07:45:24.288 --> 07:45:24.298 align:start position:0%
person's arrest record
 
07:45:26.930 --> 07:45:26.940 align:start position:0%
um or criminal history it would show up
 
07:45:29.090 --> 07:45:29.100 align:start position:0%
um it depends on whether or not the
 
07:45:30.830 --> 07:45:30.840 align:start position:0%
police department that arrested them has
 
07:45:32.628 --> 07:45:32.638 align:start position:0%
an automatic fingerprint identification
 
07:45:35.628 --> 07:45:35.638 align:start position:0%
system which puts the data directly into
 
07:45:39.110 --> 07:45:39.120 align:start position:0%
ncic digitally immediately or whether
 
07:45:42.948 --> 07:45:42.958 align:start position:0%
it's followed up later on after some
 
07:45:45.230 --> 07:45:45.240 align:start position:0%
period of time so if there's there is a
 
07:45:45.240 --> 07:45:47.030 align:start position:0%
period of time so if there's there is a
lag

07:45:47.030 --> 07:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
lag
 
07:45:50.750 --> 07:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
oh maybe that's the bill we need guys
 
07:45:53.208 --> 07:45:53.218 align:start position:0%
um are there any further questions
 
07:45:56.990 --> 07:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
07:46:03.968 --> 07:46:03.978 align:start position:0%

conditions of bail by reoffending
 
07:46:50.270 --> 07:46:50.280 align:start position:0%

bail pending arraignment
 
07:46:56.510 --> 07:46:56.520 align:start position:0%

Chiefs of police and I was able to

they all are in favor of 653. in fact
 
07:50:04.548 --> 07:50:04.558 align:start position:0%
this morning I got an email from the
 
07:50:06.770 --> 07:50:06.780 align:start position:0%
chief from Lisbon and he said if this
 
07:50:08.448 --> 07:50:08.458 align:start position:0%
should pass it would make New Hampshire
 
07:50:11.270 --> 07:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
a safer place there's no doubt in my
 
07:50:11.280 --> 07:50:12.230 align:start position:0%
a safer place there's no doubt in my
mind

07:50:12.230 --> 07:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
mind
 
07:50:12.240 --> 07:50:13.670 align:start position:0%

in this state as we've heard already
 
07:50:26.448 --> 07:50:26.458 align:start position:0%
this is a a very safe State uh our
 
07:50:28.070 --> 07:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
quality life is excellent and
 
07:50:31.430 --> 07:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
fortunately most of us will never be on
 
07:50:33.888 --> 07:50:33.898 align:start position:0%
the receiving end of a crime
 
07:50:37.910 --> 07:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
in 2014 I bought a commercial piece of
 
07:50:39.708 --> 07:50:39.718 align:start position:0%
property in Littleton it was a blighted
 
07:50:41.270 --> 07:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
piece of property I made a significant
 
07:50:45.110 --> 07:50:45.120 align:start position:0%
investment where I relocated my Pharmacy
 
07:50:47.510 --> 07:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
I'm a pharmacist by profession and we
 
07:50:49.208 --> 07:50:49.218 align:start position:0%
built a state-of-the-art
 
07:50:51.948 --> 07:50:51.958 align:start position:0%
specialty pharmacy in Littleton also on
 
07:50:54.410 --> 07:50:54.420 align:start position:0%
that spot was a laundromat so I also
 
07:50:56.330 --> 07:50:56.340 align:start position:0%
became the owner of a reluctant owner of
 
07:50:58.730 --> 07:50:58.740 align:start position:0%
a laundromat so uh
 
07:51:01.010 --> 07:51:01.020 align:start position:0%
um fortunately I still have that with
 
07:51:04.490 --> 07:51:04.500 align:start position:0%
the salary we're getting today but uh so
 
07:51:07.430 --> 07:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
in 2014 I made an investment in made a
 
07:51:09.948 --> 07:51:09.958 align:start position:0%
huge Improvement to that end of town
 
07:51:13.490 --> 07:51:13.500 align:start position:0%
and it was a it's a wonderful place to
 
07:51:15.468 --> 07:51:15.478 align:start position:0%
to live and to work and up until
 
07:51:18.170 --> 07:51:18.180 align:start position:0%
February of last year I owned the
 
07:51:20.270 --> 07:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
pharmacy I sold that but I still own the
 
07:51:24.048 --> 07:51:24.058 align:start position:0%
laundromat in the summer of 2019 it was
 
07:51:27.110 --> 07:51:27.120 align:start position:0%
early mid-morning we looked out our
 
07:51:29.930 --> 07:51:29.940 align:start position:0%
window of the pharmacy and we noticed a
 
07:51:32.030 --> 07:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
car a suspicious looking car out in our
 
07:51:33.048 --> 07:51:33.058 align:start position:0%
parking lot
 
07:51:35.208 --> 07:51:35.218 align:start position:0%
and we washed it for a few minutes and
 
07:51:37.490 --> 07:51:37.500 align:start position:0%
we realized what was going on there this
 
07:51:39.590 --> 07:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
gentleman was selling drugs out of his
 
07:51:41.930 --> 07:51:41.940 align:start position:0%
car he would stay there and a car would
 
07:51:44.930 --> 07:51:44.940 align:start position:0%
pull up we'd watch the transaction uh
 
07:51:48.048 --> 07:51:48.058 align:start position:0%
there was no there was no effort to to
 
07:51:49.850 --> 07:51:49.860 align:start position:0%
disguise that a few minutes later
 
07:51:51.410 --> 07:51:51.420 align:start position:0%
another car would show up and it would
 
07:51:53.388 --> 07:51:53.398 align:start position:0%
keep going on I want to remind you that
 
07:51:55.368 --> 07:51:55.378 align:start position:0%
or point out the fact that our Pharmacy
 
07:51:57.650 --> 07:51:57.660 align:start position:0%
our business is directly across the
 
07:52:00.230 --> 07:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
street 150 feet away from the Littleton
 
07:52:01.730 --> 07:52:01.740 align:start position:0%
Elementary School Lakeway Elementary
 
07:52:01.740 --> 07:52:02.750 align:start position:0%
Elementary School Lakeway Elementary
School

07:52:02.750 --> 07:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
School
 
07:52:04.548 --> 07:52:04.558 align:start position:0%
so this process went on for about an
 
07:52:05.750 --> 07:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
hour we called the police the police
 
07:52:07.730 --> 07:52:07.740 align:start position:0%
showed up they said you did the right
 
07:52:07.740 --> 07:52:09.468 align:start position:0%
showed up they said you did the right
thing

07:52:09.468 --> 07:52:09.478 align:start position:0%
thing
 
07:52:11.270 --> 07:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
they took the guy off
 
07:52:13.430 --> 07:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
two hours later he was back selling
 
07:52:13.440 --> 07:52:14.510 align:start position:0%
two hours later he was back selling
drugs

07:52:14.510 --> 07:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
drugs
 
07:52:17.030 --> 07:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
doing the same stuff that he was doing
 
07:52:18.708 --> 07:52:18.718 align:start position:0%
two hours before
 
07:52:18.718 --> 07:52:20.510 align:start position:0%
two hours before
and

07:52:20.510 --> 07:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:52:24.170 --> 07:52:24.180 align:start position:0%
we were flabbergasted by it and as you
 
07:52:27.650 --> 07:52:27.660 align:start position:0%
can probably understand that it caused a
 
07:52:29.570 --> 07:52:29.580 align:start position:0%
lot of consternation and concern for our
 
07:52:31.368 --> 07:52:31.378 align:start position:0%
employees who are working in a pharmacy
 
07:52:34.430 --> 07:52:34.440 align:start position:0%
having drug Seekers coming to our
 
07:52:36.110 --> 07:52:36.120 align:start position:0%
parking lot to transact their business
 
07:52:38.750 --> 07:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
so we called the police again and you
 
07:52:40.968 --> 07:52:40.978 align:start position:0%
know I laid into the police a little bit
 
07:52:43.150 --> 07:52:43.160 align:start position:0%
about what what's going on
 
07:52:45.650 --> 07:52:45.660 align:start position:0%
and they apologized they said we're
 
07:52:47.690 --> 07:52:47.700 align:start position:0%
sorry we're really sorry there's nothing
 
07:52:49.490 --> 07:52:49.500 align:start position:0%
that we can do in the way the system is
 
07:52:51.530 --> 07:52:51.540 align:start position:0%
we can't hold these people
 
07:52:54.170 --> 07:52:54.180 align:start position:0%
so this went on for two weeks and they
 
07:52:55.850 --> 07:52:55.860 align:start position:0%
they did say please call the police if
 
07:52:58.670 --> 07:52:58.680 align:start position:0%
it happens two weeks this went on all
 
07:53:01.548 --> 07:53:01.558 align:start position:0%
day a constant stream of drug activity
 
07:53:04.430 --> 07:53:04.440 align:start position:0%
in our parking lot one morning we woke
 
07:53:08.030 --> 07:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
up to a guy overdosed in his car
 
07:53:10.128 --> 07:53:10.138 align:start position:0%
when we showed up for work
 
07:53:12.170 --> 07:53:12.180 align:start position:0%
so we called the police again and the
 
07:53:13.610 --> 07:53:13.620 align:start position:0%
guy actually woke up before the
 
07:53:15.530 --> 07:53:15.540 align:start position:0%
ambulance got there and tore off down
 
07:53:17.150 --> 07:53:17.160 align:start position:0%
the street and what kind of state that
 
07:53:20.270 --> 07:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
was I I can't even imagine
 
07:53:22.730 --> 07:53:22.740 align:start position:0%
but the point that I'm trying to make if
 
07:53:24.708 --> 07:53:24.718 align:start position:0%
you haven't got it now we've got a
 
07:53:26.628 --> 07:53:26.638 align:start position:0%
problem here I mean the the the the
 
07:53:29.208 --> 07:53:29.218 align:start position:0%
position we're in was certainly to
 
07:53:31.368 --> 07:53:31.378 align:start position:0%
protect rights and I
 
07:53:33.850 --> 07:53:33.860 align:start position:0%
very much believe in that but what about
 
07:53:36.708 --> 07:53:36.718 align:start position:0%
my rights what about my rights to to
 
07:53:38.750 --> 07:53:38.760 align:start position:0%
provide for my family what about the
 
07:53:40.788 --> 07:53:40.798 align:start position:0%
rights of my employees to provide for
 
07:53:42.830 --> 07:53:42.840 align:start position:0%
their families in fact during that time
 
07:53:44.388 --> 07:53:44.398 align:start position:0%
I had an employee quit because she said
 
07:53:47.590 --> 07:53:47.600 align:start position:0%
she didn't feel safe because
 
07:53:50.570 --> 07:53:50.580 align:start position:0%
three minutes all right pretty much stop
 
07:53:53.150 --> 07:53:53.160 align:start position:0%
it there so I I urge you to take action
 
07:53:56.448 --> 07:53:56.458 align:start position:0%
I urge to support 653 in any other types
 
07:53:58.610 --> 07:53:58.620 align:start position:0%
of bail reform that you can you can
 
07:54:01.430 --> 07:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
consider so thank you
 
07:54:07.368 --> 07:54:07.378 align:start position:0%
 
07:54:14.208 --> 07:54:14.218 align:start position:0%
 
07:54:16.368 --> 07:54:16.378 align:start position:0%
Victoria I do see that you have here um
 
07:54:18.110 --> 07:54:18.120 align:start position:0%
that you have written testimony so if
 
07:54:19.788 --> 07:54:19.798 align:start position:0%
you handed out your testimony we would
 
07:54:21.230 --> 07:54:21.240 align:start position:0%
just ask that you summarize it but if
 
07:54:22.788 --> 07:54:22.798 align:start position:0%
you haven't handed out and it's just for
 
07:54:24.350 --> 07:54:24.360 align:start position:0%
you to read it that's that's completely
 
07:54:24.360 --> 07:54:25.310 align:start position:0%
you to read it that's that's completely
different

07:54:25.310 --> 07:54:25.320 align:start position:0%
different
 
07:54:29.510 --> 07:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:54:30.888 --> 07:54:30.898 align:start position:0%
usually people can hear me without it
 
07:54:33.410 --> 07:54:33.420 align:start position:0%
but I I respect
 
07:54:35.270 --> 07:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for having me here today my
 
07:54:36.948 --> 07:54:36.958 align:start position:0%
name is Victoria Sullivan and I am from
 
07:54:38.510 --> 07:54:38.520 align:start position:0%
Manchester New Hampshire
 
07:54:41.208 --> 07:54:41.218 align:start position:0%
almost immediately after Senate Bill 556
 
07:54:43.910 --> 07:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
was passed in 2018. there were calls to
 
07:54:46.310 --> 07:54:46.320 align:start position:0%
revise the law five years later the law
 
07:54:47.990 --> 07:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
has proven to be more damaging to have
 
07:54:49.610 --> 07:54:49.620 align:start position:0%
more damaging consequences to the
 
07:54:51.288 --> 07:54:51.298 align:start position:0%
quality of life issues of my city of
 
07:54:53.330 --> 07:54:53.340 align:start position:0%
Manchester than any other law this
 
07:54:54.830 --> 07:54:54.840 align:start position:0%
legislature has passed at least in
 
07:54:57.110 --> 07:54:57.120 align:start position:0%
recent history this law is certainly not
 
07:54:59.448 --> 07:54:59.458 align:start position:0%
the only issue the Manchester faces poor
 
07:55:01.010 --> 07:55:01.020 align:start position:0%
leadership has led to significant growth
 
07:55:02.270 --> 07:55:02.280 align:start position:0%
in homeless encampments those
 
07:55:04.310 --> 07:55:04.320 align:start position:0%
encampments provide hiding places for
 
07:55:06.288 --> 07:55:06.298 align:start position:0%
Very Bad actors and provides them a
 
07:55:08.990 --> 07:55:09.000 align:start position:0%
cover to go to commit additional crimes
 
07:55:10.430 --> 07:55:10.440 align:start position:0%
that's part of the reason why you're
 
07:55:11.930 --> 07:55:11.940 align:start position:0%
hearing about some so much of it
 
07:55:13.490 --> 07:55:13.500 align:start position:0%
happening in Manchester
 
07:55:15.410 --> 07:55:15.420 align:start position:0%
I had the honor of serving with some of
 
07:55:17.150 --> 07:55:17.160 align:start position:0%
you my voting record supports the fact
 
07:55:19.310 --> 07:55:19.320 align:start position:0%
that I am a liberty-minded person I
 
07:55:20.990 --> 07:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
believe in bail reform but I also
 
07:55:22.610 --> 07:55:22.620 align:start position:0%
believe in consequences for actions
 
07:55:24.888 --> 07:55:24.898 align:start position:0%
however this law created a catch and
 
07:55:26.570 --> 07:55:26.580 align:start position:0%
release program which has resulted in
 
07:55:28.368 --> 07:55:28.378 align:start position:0%
repeat offenders going on to commit
 
07:55:31.128 --> 07:55:31.138 align:start position:0%
violent acts let me be clear no person
 
07:55:33.170 --> 07:55:33.180 align:start position:0%
should be held simply because they are
 
07:55:35.510 --> 07:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
too impoverished to pay the bill all
 
07:55:37.310 --> 07:55:37.320 align:start position:0%
people are innocent until proven guilty
 
07:55:39.468 --> 07:55:39.478 align:start position:0%
however there is a clear pattern of
 
07:55:41.270 --> 07:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
systemic abuse of this bail Reform Bill
 
07:55:44.570 --> 07:55:44.580 align:start position:0%
which is endangering our citizenry this
 
07:55:45.888 --> 07:55:45.898 align:start position:0%
has been a frustration for police
 
07:55:47.750 --> 07:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
departments around the state who work to
 
07:55:49.430 --> 07:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
get dangerous people off the streets
 
07:55:50.930 --> 07:55:50.940 align:start position:0%
only to have them back there within
 
07:55:53.030 --> 07:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
hours last year it came before this
 
07:55:54.468 --> 07:55:54.478 align:start position:0%
committee and I ask that you passed that
 
07:55:56.750 --> 07:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
bill that was before you one similar to
 
07:55:59.090 --> 07:55:59.100 align:start position:0%
this bill that's here today I warned a
 
07:56:00.830 --> 07:56:00.840 align:start position:0%
very the very serious impact that this
 
07:56:02.990 --> 07:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
was having on the city of Manchester I
 
07:56:04.548 --> 07:56:04.558 align:start position:0%
know you did your part but I need you to
 
07:56:06.948 --> 07:56:06.958 align:start position:0%
fight for this on the house floor on the
 
07:56:08.690 --> 07:56:08.700 align:start position:0%
morning of Friday September 3rd Daniel
 
07:56:11.208 --> 07:56:11.218 align:start position:0%
Whitmore 75 year old army veteran was
 
07:56:12.230 --> 07:56:12.240 align:start position:0%
walking through the trails on
 
07:56:14.330 --> 07:56:14.340 align:start position:0%
Manchester's South End when he was
 
07:56:15.830 --> 07:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
viciously attacked and stabbed to death
 
07:56:17.990 --> 07:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
by Raymond Moore Moore had been arrested
 
07:56:21.230 --> 07:56:21.240 align:start position:0%
in both Manchester and Nashua the weeks
 
07:56:23.510 --> 07:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
before the brutal attack both times he
 
07:56:25.850 --> 07:56:25.860 align:start position:0%
was released on PR bill this murder was
 
07:56:27.708 --> 07:56:27.718 align:start position:0%
in the trails that the children used
 
07:56:29.628 --> 07:56:29.638 align:start position:0%
daily the trails that lead to the soccer
 
07:56:32.750 --> 07:56:32.760 align:start position:0%
and Little League fields my own son had
 
07:56:34.490 --> 07:56:34.500 align:start position:0%

are we supposed to lock up our children
 
07:56:42.708 --> 07:56:42.718 align:start position:0%
because people who do not believe in the
 
07:56:44.628 --> 07:56:44.638 align:start position:0%
rule of law are too weak to lock up
 
07:56:46.730 --> 07:56:46.740 align:start position:0%
dangerous repeat offenders because that
 
07:56:47.948 --> 07:56:47.958 align:start position:0%
is what we're talking about here
 
07:56:50.930 --> 07:56:50.940 align:start position:0%

07:57:54.590 --> 07:57:54.600 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for that Victoria because
 
07:57:55.910 --> 07:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
you didn't put that on there and I'm
 
07:57:57.530 --> 07:57:57.540 align:start position:0%
here defending myself and you just threw
 
07:57:59.030 --> 07:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
me under the bus thanks thanks
 
07:58:01.610 --> 07:58:01.620 align:start position:0%
appreciate that just kidding just
 
07:58:03.410 --> 07:58:03.420 align:start position:0%
kidding but just kidding just having fun
 
07:58:13.190 --> 07:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:58:15.468 --> 07:58:15.478 align:start position:0%
Madam chair thank you
 
07:58:18.590 --> 07:58:18.600 align:start position:0%
um although I object to the
 
07:58:20.750 --> 07:58:20.760 align:start position:0%
um impossible burden you've placed on a
 
07:58:22.190 --> 07:58:22.200 align:start position:0%
law professor to only talk for three
 
07:58:22.200 --> 07:58:24.288 align:start position:0%
law professor to only talk for three
minutes

07:58:24.288 --> 07:58:24.298 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
07:58:27.170 --> 07:58:27.180 align:start position:0%
um one I want to say something that's
 
07:58:29.628 --> 07:58:29.638 align:start position:0%
bothered me for a long time
 
07:58:32.270 --> 07:58:32.280 align:start position:0%
the term Catch and Release refers to
 
07:58:35.628 --> 07:58:35.638 align:start position:0%
fish it doesn't refer to human beings
 
07:58:38.868 --> 07:58:38.878 align:start position:0%
and I resent the fact that this is bail
 
07:58:40.368 --> 07:58:40.378 align:start position:0%
reform is called Catch and Release
 
07:58:43.128 --> 07:58:43.138 align:start position:0%
that's not what it is it's a very
 
07:58:45.830 --> 07:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
sophisticated complicated effort to
 
07:58:49.310 --> 07:58:49.320 align:start position:0%
balance Public Safety and uh and the
 
07:58:51.650 --> 07:58:51.660 align:start position:0%
rights of individuals so let's talk
 
07:58:54.530 --> 07:58:54.540 align:start position:0%
about uh how uh representative Barry
 
07:58:55.910 --> 07:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
misled you
 
07:58:59.750 --> 07:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
the problem that came that uh that
 
07:59:03.350 --> 07:59:03.360 align:start position:0%
caused uh Mr whittlemore's death was not
 
07:59:06.530 --> 07:59:06.540 align:start position:0%
the failure of the bail statute the
 
07:59:09.190 --> 07:59:09.200 align:start position:0%
problem was the failure of several
 
07:59:13.190 --> 07:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
prosecutors to do their job what
 
07:59:16.430 --> 07:59:16.440 align:start position:0%
happened is Mr Whittemore was arrested
 
07:59:19.310 --> 07:59:19.320 align:start position:0%
for an attempted first degree assault he
 
07:59:21.948 --> 07:59:21.958 align:start position:0%
had been surrounded by a group of
 
07:59:24.288 --> 07:59:24.298 align:start position:0%
homeless people he pulled out a knife
 
07:59:26.628 --> 07:59:26.638 align:start position:0%
and was waving it around like that it
 
07:59:29.030 --> 07:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
wasn't an individual threat to a
 
07:59:31.788 --> 07:59:31.798 align:start position:0%
particular person the police were called
 
07:59:34.070 --> 07:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
he was arrested and he was charged with
 
07:59:37.868 --> 07:59:37.878 align:start position:0%
attempted first degree assault he then
 
07:59:40.968 --> 07:59:40.978 align:start position:0%
saw a judge he was held by the Bell
 
07:59:44.330 --> 07:59:44.340 align:start position:0%
commissioner he then saw a judge that's
 
07:59:48.110 --> 07:59:48.120 align:start position:0%
in accord with uh with the statute as it
 
07:59:51.048 --> 07:59:51.058 align:start position:0%
currently exists they had a hearing the
 
07:59:53.330 --> 07:59:53.340 align:start position:0%
prosecutor said I want him preventively
 
07:59:55.968 --> 07:59:55.978 align:start position:0%
detained or if you grant PR bail I want
 
07:59:58.968 --> 07:59:58.978 align:start position:0%
some conditions not a overwhelming plea
 
08:00:01.610 --> 08:00:01.620 align:start position:0%
to have him held uh the defense attorney
 
08:00:04.190 --> 08:00:04.200 align:start position:0%
made their uh made their pitch and the
 
08:00:05.628 --> 08:00:05.638 align:start position:0%
judge said
 
08:00:08.090 --> 08:00:08.100 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to hold this guy I'm going
 
08:00:11.170 --> 08:00:11.180 align:start position:0%
to have PR bail with conditions because
 
08:00:14.810 --> 08:00:14.820 align:start position:0%
this is a very tribal case
 
08:00:16.788 --> 08:00:16.798 align:start position:0%
I've I've gotten access to the
 
08:00:18.650 --> 08:00:18.660 align:start position:0%
transcript of that hearing I've read the
 
08:00:20.690 --> 08:00:20.700 align:start position:0%
hearing that's what the judge said
 
08:00:24.110 --> 08:00:24.120 align:start position:0%
that's why he got PR bail because it is
 
08:00:28.490 --> 08:00:28.500 align:start position:0%
not uh it is something less than a a
 
08:00:32.150 --> 08:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
vicious threat of killing people
 
08:00:37.670 --> 08:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
that is in early July in early August uh
 
08:00:41.810 --> 08:00:41.820 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Moore is uh arrested and charged
 
08:00:45.170 --> 08:00:45.180 align:start position:0%
with failure to leave McDonald's a
 
08:00:46.730 --> 08:00:46.740 align:start position:0%
criminal trespass
 
08:00:50.388 --> 08:00:50.398 align:start position:0%
there's no uh there's no hearing at that
 
08:00:53.570 --> 08:00:53.580 align:start position:0%
point in early September or late August
 
08:00:55.968 --> 08:00:55.978 align:start position:0%
later August he's then arrested for
 
08:00:58.910 --> 08:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
resisting arrest
 
08:01:02.030 --> 08:01:02.040 align:start position:0%
uh on two uh two times in the same
 
08:01:04.250 --> 08:01:04.260 align:start position:0%
incident one of the resisting arrests
 
08:01:07.490 --> 08:01:07.500 align:start position:0%
was he failed he was resisting putting
 
08:01:11.090 --> 08:01:11.100 align:start position:0%
his feet in the police cruiser so I to
 
08:01:13.490 --> 08:01:13.500 align:start position:0%
characterize that as a violent crime I
 
08:01:15.888 --> 08:01:15.898 align:start position:0%
think is is a bit of a stretch
 
08:01:19.190 --> 08:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
he then goes in front of a judge in
 
08:01:21.708 --> 08:01:21.718 align:start position:0%
Nashua district court
 
08:01:25.368 --> 08:01:25.378 align:start position:0%
now here's the key part the prosecutor
 
08:01:25.378 --> 08:01:27.128 align:start position:0%
now here's the key part the prosecutor
there

08:01:27.128 --> 08:01:27.138 align:start position:0%
there
 
08:01:30.888 --> 08:01:30.898 align:start position:0%
asked for PR bail personal recognizance
 
08:01:34.250 --> 08:01:34.260 align:start position:0%
bail made I've read the transcript of
 
08:01:37.610 --> 08:01:37.620 align:start position:0%
that hearing made no request
 
08:01:40.250 --> 08:01:40.260 align:start position:0%
made no mention whatsoever of the fact
 
08:01:43.670 --> 08:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
that Mr Moore was out on PR bail on an
 
08:01:46.010 --> 08:01:46.020 align:start position:0%
attempted first degree assault no
 
08:01:48.830 --> 08:01:48.840 align:start position:0%
mention whatsoever and it's because of
 
08:01:51.170 --> 08:01:51.180 align:start position:0%
that failure on the prosecutor's part
 
08:01:53.628 --> 08:01:53.638 align:start position:0%
that he was released
 
08:01:56.628 --> 08:01:56.638 align:start position:0%
second thing that didn't happen that
 
08:01:59.690 --> 08:01:59.700 align:start position:0%
caused the death of Mr Whittemore is the
 
08:02:01.670 --> 08:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
prosecutor in the superior court case
 
08:02:04.250 --> 08:02:04.260 align:start position:0%
back in early July
 
08:02:07.548 --> 08:02:07.558 align:start position:0%
he never filed find if if he ever found
 
08:02:10.910 --> 08:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
out about these subsequent misdemeanors
 
08:02:13.128 --> 08:02:13.138 align:start position:0%
that he was charged with he never filed
 
08:02:16.490 --> 08:02:16.500 align:start position:0%
a motion to revoke Baal in Superior
 
08:02:20.150 --> 08:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
Court the bail that Mr Moore was on so
 
08:02:23.448 --> 08:02:23.458 align:start position:0%
Mr Whittemore would be alive but for the
 
08:02:26.270 --> 08:02:26.280 align:start position:0%
abject failure of the prosecutors to do
 
08:02:29.750 --> 08:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
their job if they had done their job he
 
08:02:31.910 --> 08:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
would have been held under the current
 
08:02:33.530 --> 08:02:33.540 align:start position:0%
bail statute
 
08:02:36.530 --> 08:02:36.540 align:start position:0%
so I appreciate deeply what a compelling
 
08:02:40.010 --> 08:02:40.020 align:start position:0%
story Mr whittemore's Case is but it's a
 
08:02:42.110 --> 08:02:42.120 align:start position:0%
compelling story not about the failure
 
08:02:44.090 --> 08:02:44.100 align:start position:0%
of the bail statute it's a compelling
 
08:02:46.310 --> 08:02:46.320 align:start position:0%
story about the failure of prosecutors
 
08:02:48.650 --> 08:02:48.660 align:start position:0%
to do their job
 
08:02:51.888 --> 08:02:51.898 align:start position:0%
um this bill is a is a mix of two bills
 
08:02:53.930 --> 08:02:53.940 align:start position:0%
from last session
 
08:02:57.830 --> 08:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
08:03:01.310 --> 08:03:01.320 align:start position:0%
two bills uh uh from last session one
 
08:03:03.350 --> 08:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
representative Barry's original bill
 
08:03:06.230 --> 08:03:06.240 align:start position:0%
that made it through the house but
 
08:03:08.150 --> 08:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
failed in the Senate
 
08:03:11.090 --> 08:03:11.100 align:start position:0%
and Senator Bradley's bill that made it
 
08:03:12.830 --> 08:03:12.840 align:start position:0%
through the through the Senate and
 
08:03:16.310 --> 08:03:16.320 align:start position:0%
failed in the house it then went to uh
 
08:03:19.490 --> 08:03:19.500 align:start position:0%
uh it then went to a committee of
 
08:03:21.650 --> 08:03:21.660 align:start position:0%
conference in the Senate where
 
08:03:23.810 --> 08:03:23.820 align:start position:0%
representative Berry was there and they
 
08:03:26.090 --> 08:03:26.100 align:start position:0%
were mushed together and it fell apart
 
08:03:29.388 --> 08:03:29.398 align:start position:0%
so each component of this bill has
 
08:03:32.868 --> 08:03:32.878 align:start position:0%
failed in one chamber of the legislature
 
08:03:32.878 --> 08:03:33.770 align:start position:0%
failed in one chamber of the legislature
um

08:03:33.770 --> 08:03:33.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:03:38.510 --> 08:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
I will uh last thing I'll say uh the 700
 
08:03:38.520 --> 08:03:40.430 align:start position:0%
I will uh last thing I'll say uh the 700
arrest

08:03:40.430 --> 08:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
arrest
 
08:03:43.190 --> 08:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
uh for people who are already out on
 
08:03:43.200 --> 08:03:44.388 align:start position:0%
uh for people who are already out on
bail

08:03:44.388 --> 08:03:44.398 align:start position:0%
bail
 
08:03:47.330 --> 08:03:47.340 align:start position:0%
to use a formal legal term where the
 
08:03:50.810 --> 08:03:50.820 align:start position:0%
heck are the prosecutors if people are
 
08:03:52.968 --> 08:03:52.978 align:start position:0%
committing are being arrested for a
 
08:03:55.610 --> 08:03:55.620 align:start position:0%
crime being arrested being let out on PR
 
08:03:58.310 --> 08:03:58.320 align:start position:0%
bail and committing another crime the
 
08:04:01.310 --> 08:04:01.320 align:start position:0%
current bail statute as it exists allows
 
08:04:03.650 --> 08:04:03.660 align:start position:0%
the prosecutor to file a motion to
 
08:04:06.410 --> 08:04:06.420 align:start position:0%
revoke bail it appears they're not doing
 
08:04:06.420 --> 08:04:07.368 align:start position:0%
revoke bail it appears they're not doing
that

08:04:07.368 --> 08:04:07.378 align:start position:0%
that
 
08:04:14.510 --> 08:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
08:04:17.448 --> 08:04:17.458 align:start position:0%
 
08:04:19.128 --> 08:04:19.138 align:start position:0%
will you answer will you answer a
 
08:04:19.138 --> 08:04:19.930 align:start position:0%
will you answer will you answer a
question

08:04:19.930 --> 08:04:19.940 align:start position:0%
question
 
08:04:25.788 --> 08:04:25.798 align:start position:0%
 
08:04:28.368 --> 08:04:28.378 align:start position:0%
any question I have and I I agree with
 
08:04:29.810 --> 08:04:29.820 align:start position:0%
what you said
 
08:04:29.820 --> 08:04:31.490 align:start position:0%
what you said
the

08:04:31.490 --> 08:04:31.500 align:start position:0%
the
 
08:04:35.090 --> 08:04:35.100 align:start position:0%
he also said that we that we're we're
 
08:04:36.288 --> 08:04:36.298 align:start position:0%
looking at the jails are going to fill
 
08:04:39.010 --> 08:04:39.020 align:start position:0%
up and I that's not my point my point is
 
08:04:41.330 --> 08:04:41.340 align:start position:0%
does this bill
 
08:04:43.128 --> 08:04:43.138 align:start position:0%
is there a potential for this bill to
 
08:04:45.230 --> 08:04:45.240 align:start position:0%
capture people that that commit a crime
 
08:04:47.530 --> 08:04:47.540 align:start position:0%
that doesn't have any jail
 
08:04:50.388 --> 08:04:50.398 align:start position:0%
punishment and then
 
08:04:52.490 --> 08:04:52.500 align:start position:0%
I'll be charged with a crime and then be
 
08:04:54.590 --> 08:04:54.600 align:start position:0%
charged with a crime that also is not
 
08:04:58.610 --> 08:04:58.620 align:start position:0%
one that has any uh thing for jail
 
08:05:01.670 --> 08:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
to be caught up in this especially on
 
08:05:04.430 --> 08:05:04.440 align:start position:0%
the off hours on the weekend and when
 
08:05:06.110 --> 08:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
the bail commission is nowhere at least
 
08:05:08.150 --> 08:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
there to give them the due process
 
08:05:11.030 --> 08:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
is it possible that a lot more people
 
08:05:12.708 --> 08:05:12.718 align:start position:0%
who get caught up in that kind of thing
 
08:05:15.590 --> 08:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
and be harmed by this bill as opposed to
 
08:05:18.830 --> 08:05:18.840 align:start position:0%
the obvious horrendous things that we've
 
08:05:20.810 --> 08:05:20.820 align:start position:0%
heard that were a result of the kind of
 
08:05:22.610 --> 08:05:22.620 align:start position:0%
circumstances you just described yes
 
08:05:26.030 --> 08:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
that's very possible I at a another bail
 
08:05:27.888 --> 08:05:27.898 align:start position:0%
hearing that many of you were at I
 
08:05:30.830 --> 08:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
produced a study that indicated that uh
 
08:05:34.310 --> 08:05:34.320 align:start position:0%
of the 508 cases we looked at so far
 
08:05:37.310 --> 08:05:37.320 align:start position:0%
we're continuing with that 38 percent of
 
08:05:37.320 --> 08:05:38.030 align:start position:0%
we're continuing with that 38 percent of
them

08:05:38.030 --> 08:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
them
 
08:05:40.490 --> 08:05:40.500 align:start position:0%
the charges were eventually dismissed
 
08:05:43.610 --> 08:05:43.620 align:start position:0%
and some of those people were held uh
 
08:05:45.590 --> 08:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
after several months
 
08:05:49.548 --> 08:05:49.558 align:start position:0%
um and uh yes you can be arrested for a
 
08:05:52.310 --> 08:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
Class B misdemeanor
 
08:05:55.730 --> 08:05:55.740 align:start position:0%
and then and bailed on that and arrested
 
08:05:57.770 --> 08:05:57.780 align:start position:0%
another Class B misdemeanor and
 
08:06:01.010 --> 08:06:01.020 align:start position:0%
preventively detained under
 
08:06:04.628 --> 08:06:04.638 align:start position:0%
 
08:06:07.910 --> 08:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
and that preventively detained according
 
08:06:10.070 --> 08:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
to this bill would be mandatory even
 
08:06:11.930 --> 08:06:11.940 align:start position:0%
though they were the two charges and
 
08:06:13.850 --> 08:06:13.860 align:start position:0%
neither one of them that had a jail
 
08:06:15.830 --> 08:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
possibility well I think under this bill
 
08:06:17.930 --> 08:06:17.940 align:start position:0%
they could set up high bail they could
 
08:06:20.030 --> 08:06:20.040 align:start position:0%
set some kind of bail but
 
08:06:21.650 --> 08:06:21.660 align:start position:0%
um more often than not the judge would
 
08:06:23.510 --> 08:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
preventively detain them
 
08:06:23.520 --> 08:06:26.170 align:start position:0%
preventively detain them
foreign

08:06:26.170 --> 08:06:26.180 align:start position:0%
 
08:06:28.910 --> 08:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
are you okay to ask are you okay for
 
08:06:31.010 --> 08:06:31.020 align:start position:0%
another question oh absolutely
 
08:06:32.690 --> 08:06:32.700 align:start position:0%
representative Murray
 
08:06:35.270 --> 08:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I had um one
 
08:06:36.948 --> 08:06:36.958 align:start position:0%
request and one question
 
08:06:38.388 --> 08:06:38.398 align:start position:0%
um the request is just that if you could
 
08:06:40.250 --> 08:06:40.260 align:start position:0%
send the committee
 
08:06:42.708 --> 08:06:42.718 align:start position:0%
um that kind of rundown you gave us of
 
08:06:44.150 --> 08:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
the different points in which
 
08:06:46.850 --> 08:06:46.860 align:start position:0%
prosecutors failed to properly deal with
 
08:06:49.730 --> 08:06:49.740 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Moore I will do that thank you um
 
08:06:52.548 --> 08:06:52.558 align:start position:0%
just for the members who aren't here
 
08:06:55.430 --> 08:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
and then my question was just uh
 
08:06:57.048 --> 08:06:57.058 align:start position:0%
representative Berry and introducing the
 
08:06:59.510 --> 08:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
bill mentioned that there have been 700
 
08:07:01.548 --> 08:07:01.558 align:start position:0%
arrests in Manchester alone for people
 
08:07:03.708 --> 08:07:03.718 align:start position:0%
who are already let out on bail I don't
 
08:07:05.090 --> 08:07:05.100 align:start position:0%
know you've talked about you know your
 
08:07:07.250 --> 08:07:07.260 align:start position:0%
studies with the 507 cases that you've
 
08:07:09.110 --> 08:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
been looking at um I was just wondering
 
08:07:10.850 --> 08:07:10.860 align:start position:0%
if you've heard that statistic or if you
 
08:07:13.910 --> 08:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
have any idea I read it I I heard it uh
 
08:07:16.490 --> 08:07:16.500 align:start position:0%
from Chief holdenberg at a hearing in
 
08:07:18.110 --> 08:07:18.120 align:start position:0%
the Senate and I read it in New
 
08:07:19.548 --> 08:07:19.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Journal so I'm aware of that
 
08:07:22.490 --> 08:07:22.500 align:start position:0%
uh the the suggestion that Chief
 
08:07:24.288 --> 08:07:24.298 align:start position:0%
holdenberg made when he testified in the
 
08:07:28.610 --> 08:07:28.620 align:start position:0%
Senate uh is that uh all of a sudden
 
08:07:31.310 --> 08:07:31.320 align:start position:0%
we're arresting more people who are out
 
08:07:33.530 --> 08:07:33.540 align:start position:0%
on bail last year
 
08:07:36.770 --> 08:07:36.780 align:start position:0%
um you will hear from Mr Knack that the
 
08:07:39.888 --> 08:07:39.898 align:start position:0%
crime rate in Manchester for the most
 
08:07:42.610 --> 08:07:42.620 align:start position:0%
serious crimes has gone down 14 percent
 
08:07:45.288 --> 08:07:45.298 align:start position:0%
in a since Bell reform
 
08:07:47.150 --> 08:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
it's not that paler form caused the
 
08:07:49.128 --> 08:07:49.138 align:start position:0%
crime rate to go down but it's clear
 
08:07:51.468 --> 08:07:51.478 align:start position:0%
that bail reform did not cause the crime
 
08:07:53.628 --> 08:07:53.638 align:start position:0%
rate to go up so that's context number
 
08:07:58.490 --> 08:07:58.500 align:start position:0%
one context number two is if in 2022
 
08:08:01.548 --> 08:08:01.558 align:start position:0%
they're now arresting 700 people who are
 
08:08:04.070 --> 08:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
out on bail but the crime rate has been
 
08:08:07.490 --> 08:08:07.500 align:start position:0%
going down the cause of those 700 people
 
08:08:10.430 --> 08:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
being out on bail four years after bail
 
08:08:12.948 --> 08:08:12.958 align:start position:0%
or reform was passed is not bail reform
 
08:08:15.170 --> 08:08:15.180 align:start position:0%
it's something else the obvious
 
08:08:18.770 --> 08:08:18.780 align:start position:0%
conclusion is the end of the pandemic or
 
08:08:20.048 --> 08:08:20.058 align:start position:0%
the the
 
08:08:23.410 --> 08:08:23.420 align:start position:0%
diminishing of pandemic restrictions in
 
08:08:27.650 --> 08:08:27.660 align:start position:0%
2022 caused an uptick in those kind of
 
08:08:30.230 --> 08:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
crimes has nothing to do with the bail
 
08:08:34.190 --> 08:08:34.200 align:start position:0%
reform statute second fact is uh we
 
08:08:36.948 --> 08:08:36.958 align:start position:0%
don't know whether those are as
 
08:08:39.770 --> 08:08:39.780 align:start position:0%
representative Newman uh question uh
 
08:08:41.990 --> 08:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
hinted at we don't know of those 700
 
08:08:43.730 --> 08:08:43.740 align:start position:0%
whether they're Class B misdemeanors
 
08:08:45.170 --> 08:08:45.180 align:start position:0%
that they're out on bail on where you
 
08:08:47.030 --> 08:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
can go to jail whether they're Class A
 
08:08:48.948 --> 08:08:48.958 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors how many of them are
 
08:08:50.990 --> 08:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
serious crimes how many are are not
 
08:08:53.510 --> 08:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
serious crimes and then finally
 
08:08:56.810 --> 08:08:56.820 align:start position:0%
where are the prosecutors
 
08:08:58.788 --> 08:08:58.798 align:start position:0%
um you know where are the prosecutors if
 
08:09:01.368 --> 08:09:01.378 align:start position:0%
people are being arrested let out on PR
 
08:09:03.530 --> 08:09:03.540 align:start position:0%
bail arrested again why aren't
 
08:09:05.330 --> 08:09:05.340 align:start position:0%
prosecutors being in motions to revoke
 
08:09:05.340 --> 08:09:11.708 align:start position:0%
prosecutors being in motions to revoke
bail

08:09:11.708 --> 08:09:11.718 align:start position:0%
 
08:09:13.968 --> 08:09:13.978 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question very
 
08:09:16.670 --> 08:09:16.680 align:start position:0%
late uh in the afternoon one of the
 
08:09:18.590 --> 08:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
things that representative Barry brought
 
08:09:21.530 --> 08:09:21.540 align:start position:0%
up was the purpose of this bill is
 
08:09:23.690 --> 08:09:23.700 align:start position:0%
basically to rebalance the rights of
 
08:09:25.910 --> 08:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
defendants pre-trial with the rights of
 
08:09:27.170 --> 08:09:27.180 align:start position:0%
the community
 
08:09:30.888 --> 08:09:30.898 align:start position:0%
if if this isn't the way to do it
 
08:09:32.990 --> 08:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
um and I know this may not be a fair
 
08:09:34.730 --> 08:09:34.740 align:start position:0%
question this late in the day but but
 
08:09:37.968 --> 08:09:37.978 align:start position:0%
what would you suggest as a way to
 
08:09:40.190 --> 08:09:40.200 align:start position:0%
achieve a better balance than what the
 
08:09:43.610 --> 08:09:43.620 align:start position:0%
current law is is now providing
 
08:09:48.048 --> 08:09:48.058 align:start position:0%
I have I have always testified that last
 
08:09:50.090 --> 08:09:50.100 align:start position:0%
year when we were we had these long
 
08:09:53.510 --> 08:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
hearings in this committee about Dale
 
08:09:56.090 --> 08:09:56.100 align:start position:0%
um and in Prior years I was a member of
 
08:09:59.270 --> 08:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
two bail commissions that that followed
 
08:10:02.330 --> 08:10:02.340 align:start position:0%
the the the the passage of of uh bail
 
08:10:05.090 --> 08:10:05.100 align:start position:0%
reform in 2019 there's a 2019 bail
 
08:10:07.250 --> 08:10:07.260 align:start position:0%
commission that I was a member of to try
 
08:10:08.930 --> 08:10:08.940 align:start position:0%
and rejigger that bounce and we made
 
08:10:11.270 --> 08:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
some challenges there's a 2020 bail
 
08:10:13.070 --> 08:10:13.080 align:start position:0%
commission where we did the same thing
 
08:10:16.250 --> 08:10:16.260 align:start position:0%
and we made some more changes I mean uh
 
08:10:19.128 --> 08:10:19.138 align:start position:0%
full support of instead of you know
 
08:10:22.850 --> 08:10:22.860 align:start position:0%
coming in with legislation that captures
 
08:10:25.250 --> 08:10:25.260 align:start position:0%
what one side of this complicated
 
08:10:28.868 --> 08:10:28.878 align:start position:0%
sophisticated debate is about
 
08:10:32.448 --> 08:10:32.458 align:start position:0%
let's retain all these bail bills and
 
08:10:35.990 --> 08:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
let's get together everyone who has all
 
08:10:39.230 --> 08:10:39.240 align:start position:0%
the stakeholders this summer and spend
 
08:10:42.110 --> 08:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
some time talking through the way to
 
08:10:44.448 --> 08:10:44.458 align:start position:0%
adjust uh this bill if it needs
 
08:10:46.430 --> 08:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
adjustment by you know by the end of by
 
08:10:48.288 --> 08:10:48.298 align:start position:0%
the middle of the summer I will probably
 
08:10:51.590 --> 08:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
our study will probably have not 508 but
 
08:10:55.810 --> 08:10:55.820 align:start position:0%
over 2 000 uh data points cases and and
 
08:10:58.310 --> 08:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
that's the kind of thing we need to do
 
08:11:00.288 --> 08:11:00.298 align:start position:0%
we need to base it on data and we need
 
08:11:03.048 --> 08:11:03.058 align:start position:0%
to base it on conversations with all the
 
08:11:03.058 --> 08:11:08.270 align:start position:0%
to base it on conversations with all the
stakeholders

08:11:08.270 --> 08:11:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
08:11:10.730 --> 08:11:10.740 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you madam
 
08:11:10.740 --> 08:11:11.868 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you madam
chair

08:11:11.868 --> 08:11:11.878 align:start position:0%
chair
 
08:11:13.730 --> 08:11:13.740 align:start position:0%
um I just with what you're mentioning
 
08:11:15.468 --> 08:11:15.478 align:start position:0%
with data are you saying that if we
 
08:11:17.510 --> 08:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
waited till later this year you would
 
08:11:19.310 --> 08:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
have more data on like crimes from the
 
08:11:23.448 --> 08:11:23.458 align:start position:0%
past year or uh what is that I I believe
 
08:11:25.430 --> 08:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
that a prior hearing last week in
 
08:11:30.110 --> 08:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
Representatives Hall I or maybe in in
 
08:11:32.030 --> 08:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
this room I forgot which I passed out a
 
08:11:35.930 --> 08:11:35.940 align:start position:0%
study that had 500 we'd looked at 508
 
08:11:39.590 --> 08:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
cases and we were able to tell how many
 
08:11:42.170 --> 08:11:42.180 align:start position:0%
how many times uh when somebody was out
 
08:11:45.888 --> 08:11:45.898 align:start position:0%
on bail the uh they were arrested for
 
08:11:48.170 --> 08:11:48.180 align:start position:0%
another crime and it was a dramatically
 
08:11:49.968 --> 08:11:49.978 align:start position:0%
small number
 
08:11:52.010 --> 08:11:52.020 align:start position:0%
um and we were also able to tell how
 
08:11:54.770 --> 08:11:54.780 align:start position:0%
many people were had case their cases
 
08:11:58.310 --> 08:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
dismissed after being arrested
 
08:11:58.320 --> 08:11:59.930 align:start position:0%
dismissed after being arrested
um

08:11:59.930 --> 08:11:59.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:12:03.350 --> 08:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
that's only 500 by the by the middle of
 
08:12:05.570 --> 08:12:05.580 align:start position:0%
the summer we'll have I think 2 000
 
08:12:08.030 --> 08:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
cases which will be more statistically
 
08:12:08.040 --> 08:12:09.530 align:start position:0%
cases which will be more statistically
significant

08:12:09.530 --> 08:12:09.540 align:start position:0%
significant
 
08:12:12.170 --> 08:12:12.180 align:start position:0%
um it will and we're concerned with
 
08:12:15.048 --> 08:12:15.058 align:start position:0%
individual rights but let's make
 
08:12:17.030 --> 08:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
decisions with all the stakeholders at
 
08:12:19.070 --> 08:12:19.080 align:start position:0%
the table and which are down over 33
 
08:12:22.010 --> 08:12:22.020 align:start position:0%
percent since bail reform
 
08:12:23.388 --> 08:12:23.398 align:start position:0%
um so again the notion that somehow
 
08:12:25.190 --> 08:12:25.200 align:start position:0%
belliform has made us less safe is not
 
08:12:27.230 --> 08:12:27.240 align:start position:0%
supported by data again you also heard
 
08:12:29.810 --> 08:12:29.820 align:start position:0%
from Professor Sher the um the failure
 
08:12:31.968 --> 08:12:31.978 align:start position:0%
in the case in Manchester of prosecutors
 
08:12:34.430 --> 08:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
uh both in Manchester and Nashua to use
 
08:12:36.230 --> 08:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
the multiple tools at their disposal
 
08:12:38.750 --> 08:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
again we heard rhetoric around these 700
 
08:12:40.850 --> 08:12:40.860 align:start position:0%
arrests in Manchester but what we didn't
 
08:12:42.708 --> 08:12:42.718 align:start position:0%
hear like we didn't hear with regard to
 
08:12:44.628 --> 08:12:44.638 align:start position:0%
the horrific Manchester murder was
 
08:12:46.788 --> 08:12:46.798 align:start position:0%
specific examples of how in those 700
 
08:12:49.670 --> 08:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
cases bail reform failed the bail reform
 
08:12:51.650 --> 08:12:51.660 align:start position:0%
law failed when did they not use their
 
08:12:53.690 --> 08:12:53.700 align:start position:0%
power to challenge release orders when
 
08:12:55.730 --> 08:12:55.740 align:start position:0%
did they not use their power to seek
 
08:12:58.850 --> 08:12:58.860 align:start position:0%
revoking bail for failure to comply with
 
08:12:58.860 --> 08:13:00.530 align:start position:0%
revoking bail for failure to comply with
obligations

08:13:00.530 --> 08:13:00.540 align:start position:0%
obligations
 
08:13:03.110 --> 08:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
and we heard the chief testified that he
 
08:13:04.730 --> 08:13:04.740 align:start position:0%
wasn't aware of any provisions in
 
08:13:08.448 --> 08:13:08.458 align:start position:0%
current law that enable prosecutors or
 
08:13:10.128 --> 08:13:10.138 align:start position:0%
the state to challenge release orders
 
08:13:12.888 --> 08:13:12.898 align:start position:0%
and so I just want to point out in uh
 
08:13:15.590 --> 08:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
under current law in 597
 
08:13:19.910 --> 08:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
6 e section two it says the state may
 
08:13:21.590 --> 08:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
file in Superior Court of motion for
 
08:13:23.750 --> 08:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
revocation of the order or Amendment of
 
08:13:25.190 --> 08:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
the conditions of the release set by
 
08:13:26.930 --> 08:13:26.940 align:start position:0%
municipal or district court or by
 
08:13:29.448 --> 08:13:29.458 align:start position:0%
Justice or by a bail commissioner and
 
08:13:31.070 --> 08:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
that motion shall be determined prop
 
08:13:33.530 --> 08:13:33.540 align:start position:0%
promptly and so there is clear under
 
08:13:35.510 --> 08:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
current law authority to challenge
 
08:13:37.010 --> 08:13:37.020 align:start position:0%
release orders that the government
 
08:13:39.410 --> 08:13:39.420 align:start position:0%
disagrees with it's black and white and
 
08:13:42.350 --> 08:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
they're just not doing that
 
08:13:42.360 --> 08:13:43.128 align:start position:0%
they're just not doing that
um

08:13:43.128 --> 08:13:43.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:13:45.650 --> 08:13:45.660 align:start position:0%
again we also have heard often often
 
08:13:47.330 --> 08:13:47.340 align:start position:0%
over and over that we need to pass bail
 
08:13:48.770 --> 08:13:48.780 align:start position:0%
reform because it's what we need to make
 
08:13:50.990 --> 08:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
our community safer and again that is
 
08:13:52.548 --> 08:13:52.558 align:start position:0%
the rhetoric if we actually look at the
 
08:13:54.590 --> 08:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
data the data is clear there have been
 
08:13:56.208 --> 08:13:56.218 align:start position:0%
multiple studies that have looked at the
 
08:13:58.788 --> 08:13:58.798 align:start position:0%
impact of holding people pre-trial with
 
08:14:00.110 --> 08:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
just blanket holds without
 
08:14:02.150 --> 08:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
individualized determination on whether
 
08:14:03.590 --> 08:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
they're a danger or Flight Risk which
 
08:14:05.690 --> 08:14:05.700 align:start position:0%
our current law allows the most recent
 
08:14:08.150 --> 08:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
study again that looked at 1.5 million
 
08:14:10.490 --> 08:14:10.500 align:start position:0%
cases in Kentucky between 2009 and 2018
 
08:14:13.310 --> 08:14:13.320 align:start position:0%
found that pre-trial detention for any
 
08:14:15.288 --> 08:14:15.298 align:start position:0%
times associated with a higher
 
08:14:17.690 --> 08:14:17.700 align:start position:0%
likelihood of arrest or for a new crime
 
08:14:20.208 --> 08:14:20.218 align:start position:0%
before case disposition again because
 
08:14:21.770 --> 08:14:21.780 align:start position:0%
that's triggering all the collateral
 
08:14:23.030 --> 08:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
harms that come when you're actually
 
08:14:25.548 --> 08:14:25.558 align:start position:0%
jailing someone pre-trial unnecessarily
 
08:14:28.310 --> 08:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
and finally I heard my time is up if the
 
08:14:29.868 --> 08:14:29.878 align:start position:0%
concern is really about getting people
 
08:14:31.968 --> 08:14:31.978 align:start position:0%
before a judge there's another bill HP
 
08:14:34.128 --> 08:14:34.138 align:start position:0%
46 before this committee that will
 
08:14:35.990 --> 08:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
ensure that everyone is brought it will
 
08:14:37.368 --> 08:14:37.378 align:start position:0%
replace bail Commissioners with
 
08:14:39.170 --> 08:14:39.180 align:start position:0%
magistrate judges so if the concern is
 
08:14:40.730 --> 08:14:40.740 align:start position:0%
getting people before a judge and making
 
08:14:42.650 --> 08:14:42.660 align:start position:0%
sure judges make these decisions there's
 
08:14:44.510 --> 08:14:44.520 align:start position:0%
a bill that ensures that everyone gets
 
08:14:46.070 --> 08:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
before a judge not just for these 13
 
08:14:48.590 --> 08:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
offenses but for all fences but they're
 
08:14:49.968 --> 08:14:49.978 align:start position:0%
done in a way where it doesn't undermine
 
08:14:51.650 --> 08:14:51.660 align:start position:0%
take away their Liberty unnecessarily
 
08:14:53.270 --> 08:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
Best of Both Worlds happy to answer any
 
08:14:53.280 --> 08:14:56.030 align:start position:0%
Best of Both Worlds happy to answer any
questions

08:14:56.030 --> 08:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
08:15:02.150 --> 08:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
08:15:07.250 --> 08:15:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
08:15:07.260 --> 08:15:13.070 align:start position:0%
 
s

08:15:13.070 --> 08:15:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
08:15:15.110 --> 08:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
08:15:16.910 --> 08:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Richard Sam perrel
 
08:15:19.670 --> 08:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
I'm the acting executive director of the
 
08:15:22.128 --> 08:15:22.138 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire judicial Council
 
08:15:25.548 --> 08:15:25.558 align:start position:0%
um the way I understand uh this bill is
 
08:15:28.310 --> 08:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
that it seeks to address two categories
 
08:15:31.490 --> 08:15:31.500 align:start position:0%
of situations one uh the post arrest
 
08:15:33.170 --> 08:15:33.180 align:start position:0%
attention of individuals who have
 
08:15:35.810 --> 08:15:35.820 align:start position:0%
committed certain offenses but don't
 
08:15:38.570 --> 08:15:38.580 align:start position:0%
have prior arrests immediately they're
 
08:15:41.090 --> 08:15:41.100 align:start position:0%
not on bail and those who
 
08:15:42.888 --> 08:15:42.898 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
08:15:45.288 --> 08:15:45.298 align:start position:0%
regardless of the offense charged or out
 
08:15:48.110 --> 08:15:48.120 align:start position:0%
on bail currently those are both
 
08:15:50.090 --> 08:15:50.100 align:start position:0%
situations that the person would need to
 
08:15:52.910 --> 08:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
have counsel at the hearings and while
 
08:15:54.830 --> 08:15:54.840 align:start position:0%
the judicial Council takes no position
 
08:15:59.150 --> 08:15:59.160 align:start position:0%
on the policy underlying uh this bill we
 
08:16:00.468 --> 08:16:00.478 align:start position:0%
do have some concerns about the
 
08:16:03.888 --> 08:16:03.898 align:start position:0%
resources that we would be asked to seek
 
08:16:06.650 --> 08:16:06.660 align:start position:0%
out and provide if there were additional
 
08:16:09.110 --> 08:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
bail hearings required here as you can
 
08:16:11.750 --> 08:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
see from the fiscal node our estimation
 
08:16:13.968 --> 08:16:13.978 align:start position:0%
is that there would be about 2400
 
08:16:16.850 --> 08:16:16.860 align:start position:0%
additional bail hearings per year that
 
08:16:22.968 --> 08:16:22.978 align:start position:0%
would be approximately 45 46 a week the
 
08:16:26.570 --> 08:16:26.580 align:start position:0%
current situation is that we just simply
 
08:16:29.270 --> 08:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
are struggling every day to find lawyers
 
08:16:31.788 --> 08:16:31.798 align:start position:0%
to represent people in the hearings that
 
08:16:34.368 --> 08:16:34.378 align:start position:0%
we already have and there is some
 
08:16:37.968 --> 08:16:37.978 align:start position:0%
concern that if there is that many
 
08:16:40.310 --> 08:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
additional hearings we're not going to
 
08:16:43.670 --> 08:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
be able to locate lawyers have them
 
08:16:47.030 --> 08:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
appear in court on the short notice of a
 
08:16:51.410 --> 08:16:51.420 align:start position:0%
36 hour or 24-hour hearing and to be
 
08:16:53.750 --> 08:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
able to compensate them in a way that's
 
08:16:56.270 --> 08:16:56.280 align:start position:0%
going to make them come to court the
 
08:16:59.270 --> 08:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
difficulty we have currently is that the
 
08:17:02.150 --> 08:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
public defender is already sort of
 
08:17:04.310 --> 08:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
overloaded they would handle a portion
 
08:17:06.288 --> 08:17:06.298 align:start position:0%
of the cases but in terms of additional
 
08:17:09.590 --> 08:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
lawyers those lawyers are often
 
08:17:12.110 --> 08:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
reluctant to get involved in cases that
 
08:17:14.628 --> 08:17:14.638 align:start position:0%
involve incarcerated individuals and
 
08:17:17.030 --> 08:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
often not available on the drop of a hat
 
08:17:18.770 --> 08:17:18.780 align:start position:0%
to appear in court
 
08:17:18.780 --> 08:17:20.150 align:start position:0%
to appear in court
so

08:17:20.150 --> 08:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
08:17:23.270 --> 08:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
um again while we take no position on
 
08:17:25.788 --> 08:17:25.798 align:start position:0%
the policy considerations underlying the
 
08:17:29.330 --> 08:17:29.340 align:start position:0%
bill we do have some real concerns given
 
08:17:31.910 --> 08:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
the timeline its effective date and
 
08:17:35.208 --> 08:17:35.218 align:start position:0%
being able to locate enough lawyers to
 
08:17:36.730 --> 08:17:36.740 align:start position:0%
provide those services
 
08:17:39.770 --> 08:17:39.780 align:start position:0%
that are going to be demanded here by
 
08:17:41.448 --> 08:17:41.458 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
08:17:43.610 --> 08:17:43.620 align:start position:0%
uh the last thing I just want to say is
 
08:17:46.610 --> 08:17:46.620 align:start position:0%
that there are several bills floating
 
08:17:49.070 --> 08:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
around that are very similar I have yet
 
08:17:51.888 --> 08:17:51.898 align:start position:0%
to testify on any of them and I chose to
 
08:17:54.888 --> 08:17:54.898 align:start position:0%
do so today because the judicial Council
 
08:17:56.628 --> 08:17:56.638 align:start position:0%
has been asked to provide fiscal notes
 
08:17:59.628 --> 08:17:59.638 align:start position:0%
on some of these but not on others and
 
08:18:01.910 --> 08:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
while I provided a fiscal note on this
 
08:18:05.690 --> 08:18:05.700 align:start position:0%
one I really wanted to sort of come and
 
08:18:07.610 --> 08:18:07.620 align:start position:0%
articulate for you what our actual
 
08:18:09.830 --> 08:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
concern is in terms of providing the
 
08:18:12.170 --> 08:18:12.180 align:start position:0%
resources that are being asked for
 
08:18:13.910 --> 08:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any questions if you
 
08:18:16.310 --> 08:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
08:18:18.288 --> 08:18:18.298 align:start position:0%
thank you seeing none thank you very
 
08:18:18.298 --> 08:18:21.830 align:start position:0%
thank you seeing none thank you very
much

08:18:21.830 --> 08:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
08:18:30.650 --> 08:18:30.660 align:start position:0%
 
08:18:34.930 --> 08:18:34.940 align:start position:0%
uh good evening David Rothstein I'm here
 
08:18:37.010 --> 08:18:37.020 align:start position:0%
opposing the bill on behalf of the New
 
08:18:38.270 --> 08:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of criminal
 
08:18:39.948 --> 08:18:39.958 align:start position:0%
defense lawyers I'm going to try for 90
 
08:18:41.750 --> 08:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
seconds rather than three minutes three
 
08:18:44.930 --> 08:18:44.940 align:start position:0%
quick points one the bill has enough
 
08:18:47.150 --> 08:18:47.160 align:start position:0%
language in it has enough language to do
 
08:18:49.730 --> 08:18:49.740 align:start position:0%
what everybody here is talking about
 
08:18:52.128 --> 08:18:52.138 align:start position:0%
which is to try to enhance Public Safety
 
08:18:54.350 --> 08:18:54.360 align:start position:0%
we're training more information more
 
08:18:57.650 --> 08:18:57.660 align:start position:0%
resources are needed two paragraph three
 
08:18:59.270 --> 08:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
really struck me because you've got
 
08:19:01.788 --> 08:19:01.798 align:start position:0%
homicide leading off the bill and
 
08:19:02.990 --> 08:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
there's nobody who's charged with
 
08:19:05.330 --> 08:19:05.340 align:start position:0%
homicide who's going to get out on bail
 
08:19:07.968 --> 08:19:07.978 align:start position:0%
with a bail commissioner with a judge or
 
08:19:09.888 --> 08:19:09.898 align:start position:0%
ever as a practical matter but then
 
08:19:11.570 --> 08:19:11.580 align:start position:0%
you've got stalking you've got simple
 
08:19:13.430 --> 08:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
assault there are a lot of people
 
08:19:15.410 --> 08:19:15.420 align:start position:0%
charged with these crimes that when you
 
08:19:18.048 --> 08:19:18.058 align:start position:0%
look at them they don't do any jail time
 
08:19:19.190 --> 08:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
there are some people charged with
 
08:19:20.628 --> 08:19:20.638 align:start position:0%
simple assault to go to state prison
 
08:19:22.310 --> 08:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
there are many they plead to a
 
08:19:23.930 --> 08:19:23.940 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor they get no time so this
 
08:19:25.788 --> 08:19:25.798 align:start position:0%
grouping is a very curious grouping
 
08:19:27.410 --> 08:19:27.420 align:start position:0%
that's going to catch a lot of people in
 
08:19:29.030 --> 08:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
the net that don't need to be there
 
08:19:32.208 --> 08:19:32.218 align:start position:0%
number three the prohibition on PR very
 
08:19:33.948 --> 08:19:33.958 align:start position:0%
quick example everyone is frustrated
 
08:19:36.590 --> 08:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
when people reoffend get picked up again
 
08:19:39.530 --> 08:19:39.540 align:start position:0%
some of those people should be detained
 
08:19:41.330 --> 08:19:41.340 align:start position:0%
and maybe they should be detained more
 
08:19:44.330 --> 08:19:44.340 align:start position:0%
often other people what you want to do
 
08:19:46.310 --> 08:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
is you want to release them on PR you
 
08:19:47.690 --> 08:19:47.700 align:start position:0%
want to give them a chance because maybe
 
08:19:49.670 --> 08:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
they're mentally ill maybe there's a
 
08:19:51.590 --> 08:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder I just had a
 
08:19:54.410 --> 08:19:54.420 align:start position:0%
client today who was picked up again and
 
08:19:56.690 --> 08:19:56.700 align:start position:0%
everyone agreed that when she gets into
 
08:19:59.330 --> 08:19:59.340 align:start position:0%
a bed an inpatient treatment bed that
 
08:20:01.788 --> 08:20:01.798 align:start position:0%
her jail sentence or jail detention
 
08:20:04.670 --> 08:20:04.680 align:start position:0%
should convert to PR bail so she can be
 
08:20:06.708 --> 08:20:06.718 align:start position:0%
in treatment instead of in jail this
 
08:20:08.330 --> 08:20:08.340 align:start position:0%
type of Bill would not distinguish her
 
08:20:10.788 --> 08:20:10.798 align:start position:0%
from other people who reoffend so again
 
08:20:13.250 --> 08:20:13.260 align:start position:0%
it would cast too broad of a net you
 
08:20:15.288 --> 08:20:15.298 align:start position:0%
have the tools you have the language
 
08:20:19.730 --> 08:20:19.740 align:start position:0%
 
08:20:23.030 --> 08:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
if I may yes what you just stated that
 
08:20:25.910 --> 08:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
that there wouldn't be a a difference
 
08:20:28.430 --> 08:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
between the this this patient my
 
08:20:29.750 --> 08:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
understanding what you're saying is that
 
08:20:29.760 --> 08:20:31.430 align:start position:0%
understanding what you're saying is that
she

08:20:31.430 --> 08:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
she
 
08:20:34.490 --> 08:20:34.500 align:start position:0%
she's she's being hospitalized no she
 
08:20:36.888 --> 08:20:36.898 align:start position:0%
she was out uh there are a number of
 
08:20:38.990 --> 08:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
people I'm just talking more generically
 
08:20:41.270 --> 08:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
there are people who are out on bail for
 
08:20:44.868 --> 08:20:44.878 align:start position:0%
an offense they reoffend which again is
 
08:20:47.090 --> 08:20:47.100 align:start position:0%
not what we want to have happen but
 
08:20:48.888 --> 08:20:48.898 align:start position:0%
there are surrounding circumstances they
 
08:20:50.628 --> 08:20:50.638 align:start position:0%
have a mental illness they were homeless
 
08:20:52.430 --> 08:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
they have substance use disorder they
 
08:20:54.110 --> 08:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
don't stab somebody
 
08:20:55.788 --> 08:20:55.798 align:start position:0%
um they may be trespassed they may be
 
08:20:57.468 --> 08:20:57.478 align:start position:0%
committed another drug offense they're
 
08:21:00.110 --> 08:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
picked up they're put in jail so we
 
08:21:02.570 --> 08:21:02.580 align:start position:0%
reach an agreement that their preventive
 
08:21:05.570 --> 08:21:05.580 align:start position:0%
detention should convert to PR bail if
 
08:21:07.490 --> 08:21:07.500 align:start position:0%
they're if they get into an inpatient
 
08:21:09.048 --> 08:21:09.058 align:start position:0%
bed that people are working to get them
 
08:21:11.990 --> 08:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
into under this type of Statute would
 
08:21:13.730 --> 08:21:13.740 align:start position:0%
say you can't get PR bail you've
 
08:21:16.250 --> 08:21:16.260 align:start position:0%
reoffended you've been rearrested you're
 
08:21:19.850 --> 08:21:19.860 align:start position:0%
treated like anybody else who reoffends
 
08:21:22.010 --> 08:21:22.020 align:start position:0%
and gets rearrested it's just I believe
 
08:21:23.990 --> 08:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
an example of how you need to look at
 
08:21:26.330 --> 08:21:26.340 align:start position:0%
individual circumstances some people in
 
08:21:28.490 --> 08:21:28.500 align:start position:0%
a rearrest situation I'm a criminal
 
08:21:30.590 --> 08:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
defense attorney I would represent them
 
08:21:32.150 --> 08:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
I would try to argue that get out
 
08:21:33.948 --> 08:21:33.958 align:start position:0%
they're going to be detained because
 
08:21:35.570 --> 08:21:35.580 align:start position:0%
they've been rearrested for certain
 
08:21:37.010 --> 08:21:37.020 align:start position:0%
types of offenses or because there's
 
08:21:39.048 --> 08:21:39.058 align:start position:0%
certain types of people other people
 
08:21:41.510 --> 08:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
should not be detained because they were
 
08:21:44.510 --> 08:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
rearrested and I do believe that the
 
08:21:46.610 --> 08:21:46.620 align:start position:0%
people closest to the situation if
 
08:21:48.410 --> 08:21:48.420 align:start position:0%
they're doing their jobs they have the
 
08:21:50.030 --> 08:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
potential to sort through those people
 
08:21:51.708 --> 08:21:51.718 align:start position:0%
and determine
 
08:21:54.650 --> 08:21:54.660 align:start position:0%
who should be let out under perhaps
 
08:21:56.030 --> 08:21:56.040 align:start position:0%
enhanced conditions and who should be
 
08:21:56.040 --> 08:21:57.048 align:start position:0%
enhanced conditions and who should be
detained

08:21:57.048 --> 08:21:57.058 align:start position:0%
detained
 
08:21:59.388 --> 08:21:59.398 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
08:22:02.270 --> 08:22:02.280 align:start position:0%
representative Muse
 
08:22:04.368 --> 08:22:04.378 align:start position:0%
so I think what representative Berry has
 
08:22:06.590 --> 08:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
done in in the statute is he's he's
 
08:22:08.750 --> 08:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
tried to narrow down the circumstances
 
08:22:11.110 --> 08:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
so you talked about how this Bill cast
 
08:22:13.368 --> 08:22:13.378 align:start position:0%
too wide a net
 
08:22:15.590 --> 08:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
given the language that we currently
 
08:22:17.750 --> 08:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
have is there is there any way to to
 
08:22:20.030 --> 08:22:20.040 align:start position:0%
shrink that net down to a more
 
08:22:22.570 --> 08:22:22.580 align:start position:0%
acceptable level well I mean I think
 
08:22:25.010 --> 08:22:25.020 align:start position:0%
first I think you'd have to determine
 
08:22:28.250 --> 08:22:28.260 align:start position:0%
that that's what you want to do I I
 
08:22:30.708 --> 08:22:30.718 align:start position:0%
think personally I mean we have not only
 
08:22:32.270 --> 08:22:32.280 align:start position:0%
this bail statue but we have another
 
08:22:34.968 --> 08:22:34.978 align:start position:0%
bail statute that allows as Professor
 
08:22:36.590 --> 08:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
Sher referred to that allows a
 
08:22:38.448 --> 08:22:38.458 align:start position:0%
prosecutor to file a motion to revoke
 
08:22:41.750 --> 08:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
somebody's bail on that other offense we
 
08:22:43.368 --> 08:22:43.378 align:start position:0%
have presumptions that kick in if
 
08:22:46.548 --> 08:22:46.558 align:start position:0%
someone is a Flight Risk and you can see
 
08:22:47.628 --> 08:22:47.638 align:start position:0%
on their record that they're a Flight
 
08:22:49.310 --> 08:22:49.320 align:start position:0%
Risk there's a presumption that kicks in
 
08:22:51.230 --> 08:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
that has to be overcome if someone
 
08:22:53.150 --> 08:22:53.160 align:start position:0%
commits a certain type of crime that's
 
08:22:55.128 --> 08:22:55.138 align:start position:0%
going to be taken into certainly into
 
08:22:57.410 --> 08:22:57.420 align:start position:0%
consideration if someone reoffends
 
08:23:00.288 --> 08:23:00.298 align:start position:0%
there's also a presumption that kicks in
 
08:23:01.730 --> 08:23:01.740 align:start position:0%
that the person is going to have to
 
08:23:03.948 --> 08:23:03.958 align:start position:0%
overcome it's going to be harder for
 
08:23:05.750 --> 08:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
them to be released I think that's
 
08:23:07.850 --> 08:23:07.860 align:start position:0%
logical and I think that is a shrinking
 
08:23:09.888 --> 08:23:09.898 align:start position:0%
of circumstances
 
08:23:11.810 --> 08:23:11.820 align:start position:0%
and I and I think there's a possibility
 
08:23:14.150 --> 08:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
that particular people can and maybe
 
08:23:15.770 --> 08:23:15.780 align:start position:0%
should more often be detained and maybe
 
08:23:17.570 --> 08:23:17.580 align:start position:0%
you know maybe there is a an
 
08:23:19.670 --> 08:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
informational issue with with the
 
08:23:22.430 --> 08:23:22.440 align:start position:0%
Manchester Conway uh example that was
 
08:23:25.128 --> 08:23:25.138 align:start position:0%
given earlier maybe it should be out
 
08:23:27.888 --> 08:23:27.898 align:start position:0%
there faster so that if somebody does go
 
08:23:29.990 --> 08:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
out and do something up north you know
 
08:23:32.570 --> 08:23:32.580 align:start position:0%
somebody should know and and as a
 
08:23:35.690 --> 08:23:35.700 align:start position:0%
citizen I I I I I I think that that
 
08:23:37.788 --> 08:23:37.798 align:start position:0%
makes perfect sense you need you need
 
08:23:39.170 --> 08:23:39.180 align:start position:0%
information you need to know if the
 
08:23:41.628 --> 08:23:41.638 align:start position:0%
person before you is
 
08:23:44.330 --> 08:23:44.340 align:start position:0%
um you know John Q public or John Q
 
08:23:46.490 --> 08:23:46.500 align:start position:0%
criminal right and if you don't know
 
08:23:48.048 --> 08:23:48.058 align:start position:0%
that you're not going to be able to make
 
08:23:50.150 --> 08:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
good decisions so but there may be other
 
08:23:51.830 --> 08:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
ways to Shore that up without changing
 
08:23:54.288 --> 08:23:54.298 align:start position:0%
the language of the bail statute which I
 
08:23:56.628 --> 08:23:56.638 align:start position:0%
do think allows a broad range of
 
08:24:00.948 --> 08:24:00.958 align:start position:0%
 
08:24:05.628 --> 08:24:05.638 align:start position:0%
 
08:24:12.888 --> 08:24:12.898 align:start position:0%
 
08:24:14.388 --> 08:24:14.398 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
08:24:15.650 --> 08:24:15.660 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Richard head I'm
 
08:24:17.090 --> 08:24:17.100 align:start position:0%
the government Affairs coordinator for
 
08:24:19.190 --> 08:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch I wanted to clarify
 
08:24:21.110 --> 08:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
one thing when Richard testified earlier
 
08:24:23.030 --> 08:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
the other Richard testified on behalf of
 
08:24:24.830 --> 08:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
the judicial Council just to make sure
 
08:24:26.570 --> 08:24:26.580 align:start position:0%
everybody understands judicial council
 
08:24:29.150 --> 08:24:29.160 align:start position:0%
is now part of the judicial branch it is
 
08:24:30.948 --> 08:24:30.958 align:start position:0%
an executive branch agency they pay for
 
08:24:33.350 --> 08:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
the public defender so sometimes just to
 
08:24:35.750 --> 08:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
make sure everybody understood that
 
08:24:37.730 --> 08:24:37.740 align:start position:0%
um I'm not going to repeat testimony
 
08:24:40.368 --> 08:24:40.378 align:start position:0%
I've given previously on bail reform
 
08:24:43.070 --> 08:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
bills much of the same things that I've
 
08:24:45.170 --> 08:24:45.180 align:start position:0%
testified in the in the prior bills
 
08:24:47.288 --> 08:24:47.298 align:start position:0%
applies to this bill
 
08:24:50.270 --> 08:24:50.280 align:start position:0%
first part of the bill deals with the
 
08:24:53.628 --> 08:24:53.638 align:start position:0%
list of crimes when judicial Council
 
08:24:58.250 --> 08:24:58.260 align:start position:0%
estimated the fiscal impact of 2400 new
 
08:25:00.170 --> 08:25:00.180 align:start position:0%
cases that's the section they were
 
08:25:01.850 --> 08:25:01.860 align:start position:0%
talking about not section two of the
 
08:25:05.150 --> 08:25:05.160 align:start position:0%
bill so and I want to focus a couple of
 
08:25:07.330 --> 08:25:07.340 align:start position:0%
comments on section two of the bill
 
08:25:09.888 --> 08:25:09.898 align:start position:0%
section two of the bill is the repeat
 
08:25:13.548 --> 08:25:13.558 align:start position:0%
offender provision and it's in and I'm
 
08:25:15.468 --> 08:25:15.478 align:start position:0%
just going to read through it but it's
 
08:25:17.750 --> 08:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
on page two of the bill beginning on
 
08:25:20.090 --> 08:25:20.100 align:start position:0%
line 23
 
08:25:21.830 --> 08:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
um and it says a person charged with an
 
08:25:24.230 --> 08:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
offense who is or was at the time of the
 
08:25:25.968 --> 08:25:25.978 align:start position:0%
offense at the time the offense was
 
08:25:28.730 --> 08:25:28.740 align:start position:0%
committed unreleased pending trial and
 
08:25:31.968 --> 08:25:31.978 align:start position:0%
I'll stop there that's roughly where you
 
08:25:33.708 --> 08:25:33.718 align:start position:0%
stopped to get that 700 that
 
08:25:35.510 --> 08:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
representative Berry was talking about
 
08:25:38.448 --> 08:25:38.458 align:start position:0%
but then it goes on so it expands the
 
08:25:40.368 --> 08:25:40.378 align:start position:0%
group Beyond just those who are on
 
08:25:42.770 --> 08:25:42.780 align:start position:0%
release pending trial for a felony or
 
08:25:44.930 --> 08:25:44.940 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor under federal state law and
 
08:25:47.330 --> 08:25:47.340 align:start position:0%
then add to that anyone who is on
 
08:25:49.490 --> 08:25:49.500 align:start position:0%
release pending imposition or execution
 
08:25:51.948 --> 08:25:51.958 align:start position:0%
of their sentence on appeal of their
 
08:25:54.530 --> 08:25:54.540 align:start position:0%
sentence or conviction or completion of
 
08:25:57.048 --> 08:25:57.058 align:start position:0%
the sentence or a probation or parole
 
08:25:58.910 --> 08:25:58.920 align:start position:0%
for any offense under federal or state
 
08:26:01.910 --> 08:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
law so you get the 700 was just the
 
08:26:03.850 --> 08:26:03.860 align:start position:0%
folks who were out on bail essentially
 
08:26:05.990 --> 08:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
but then you add to that essentially
 
08:26:09.288 --> 08:26:09.298 align:start position:0%
everybody who is between the time of
 
08:26:11.270 --> 08:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
their first arrest to the time of the
 
08:26:13.010 --> 08:26:13.020 align:start position:0%
completion of their sentence from that
 
08:26:15.410 --> 08:26:15.420 align:start position:0%
first arrest re-arrested this provision
 
08:26:17.990 --> 08:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
would would come into play so it's a
 
08:26:21.350 --> 08:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
much larger number than 700 I won't
 
08:26:23.208 --> 08:26:23.218 align:start position:0%
repeat the testimony of given previously
 
08:26:25.128 --> 08:26:25.138 align:start position:0%
about what's happening in circuit court
 
08:26:27.110 --> 08:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
but these would all be new hearings in
 
08:26:29.270 --> 08:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court the other part I just
 
08:26:33.530 --> 08:26:33.540 align:start position:0%
wanted to highlight is this requires the
 
08:26:35.930 --> 08:26:35.940 align:start position:0%
police officer to know the status of the
 
08:26:38.570 --> 08:26:38.580 align:start position:0%
person they've just arrested and whether
 
08:26:41.208 --> 08:26:41.218 align:start position:0%
it falls within any of the any of these
 
08:26:44.030 --> 08:26:44.040 align:start position:0%
statuses from bail through completion of
 
08:26:46.730 --> 08:26:46.740 align:start position:0%
sentence for the prior crime they do not
 
08:26:48.350 --> 08:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
have that information when they are
 
08:26:50.270 --> 08:26:50.280 align:start position:0%
arresting so
 
08:26:52.310 --> 08:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
at the time of rest
 
08:26:55.368 --> 08:26:55.378 align:start position:0%
there's not a list that they can go
 
08:26:57.288 --> 08:26:57.298 align:start position:0%
punch the guy's name into the girl's
 
08:26:59.868 --> 08:26:59.878 align:start position:0%
name woman's name into and say this is
 
08:27:02.270 --> 08:27:02.280 align:start position:0%
the status of that person I can't put
 
08:27:04.070 --> 08:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
this person before a bail commissioner I
 
08:27:05.868 --> 08:27:05.878 align:start position:0%
have to detain that information is just
 
08:27:09.530 --> 08:27:09.540 align:start position:0%
not available to them at that time what
 
08:27:12.288 --> 08:27:12.298 align:start position:0%
that means in in terms of policy I leave
 
08:27:14.150 --> 08:27:14.160 align:start position:0%
that to you but I just wanted to flag
 
08:27:17.030 --> 08:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
that for purposes just provide that
 
08:27:19.430 --> 08:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
information to you with that I will
 
08:27:20.930 --> 08:27:20.940 align:start position:0%
conclude my comments but I would be
 
08:27:23.750 --> 08:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions
 
08:27:25.670 --> 08:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
representative Pratt
 
08:27:27.770 --> 08:27:27.780 align:start position:0%
would you care to comment on the failure
 
08:27:29.388 --> 08:27:29.398 align:start position:0%
of prosecutors
 
08:27:32.810 --> 08:27:32.820 align:start position:0%
I don't have any position on on the
 
08:27:34.730 --> 08:27:34.740 align:start position:0%
previous testimony
 
08:27:35.990 --> 08:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
08:27:36.000 --> 08:27:39.288 align:start position:0%
thank you
represented

08:27:39.288 --> 08:27:39.298 align:start position:0%
 
08:27:41.208 --> 08:27:41.218 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
08:27:43.010 --> 08:27:43.020 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
08:27:44.930 --> 08:27:44.940 align:start position:0%
um from listening to the testimony on
 
08:27:46.190 --> 08:27:46.200 align:start position:0%
this bill and so many other bills
 
08:27:49.910 --> 08:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
relating to the courts and bail and Etc
 
08:27:51.948 --> 08:27:51.958 align:start position:0%
um to me it almost seems like the issue
 
08:27:54.708 --> 08:27:54.718 align:start position:0%
is more about the um underemployment
 
08:27:56.930 --> 08:27:56.940 align:start position:0%
that is currently in the system and the
 
08:27:59.388 --> 08:27:59.398 align:start position:0%
stress that the court is under and that
 
08:28:00.830 --> 08:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
is why maybe some of these cases are
 
08:28:03.468 --> 08:28:03.478 align:start position:0%
slipping through and we're seeing issues
 
08:28:05.150 --> 08:28:05.160 align:start position:0%
um with how the system is being run
 
08:28:06.048 --> 08:28:06.058 align:start position:0%
right now
 
08:28:09.110 --> 08:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
um do you think that that could be part
 
08:28:11.270 --> 08:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
of the problem
 
08:28:12.468 --> 08:28:12.478 align:start position:0%
um so thank you for the question there
 
08:28:16.850 --> 08:28:16.860 align:start position:0%
are two aspects to the the current
 
08:28:18.708 --> 08:28:18.718 align:start position:0%
stress in the system with regard to
 
08:28:22.190 --> 08:28:22.200 align:start position:0%
judges we have all the judges that we're
 
08:28:23.930 --> 08:28:23.940 align:start position:0%
supposed to have there's one that's been
 
08:28:25.610 --> 08:28:25.620 align:start position:0%
nominated that will presumably fill in
 
08:28:26.948 --> 08:28:26.958 align:start position:0%
the Circuit Court
 
08:28:31.910 --> 08:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
in uh in terms of Staffing we are uh
 
08:28:34.670 --> 08:28:34.680 align:start position:0%
down in terms of the number of Staff we
 
08:28:37.490 --> 08:28:37.500 align:start position:0%
aren't able to fully staff we're down I
 
08:28:39.048 --> 08:28:39.058 align:start position:0%
think around 10 percent but don't hold
 
08:28:40.368 --> 08:28:40.378 align:start position:0%
me that
 
08:28:42.610 --> 08:28:42.620 align:start position:0%
what we do know though is
 
08:28:45.110 --> 08:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding any shortages
 
08:28:47.270 --> 08:28:47.280 align:start position:0%
based on the weighted caseload study
 
08:28:50.330 --> 08:28:50.340 align:start position:0%
that we did last year which measured the
 
08:28:53.150 --> 08:28:53.160 align:start position:0%
need in terms of judicial resources the
 
08:28:55.310 --> 08:28:55.320 align:start position:0%
judges but also in terms of Staffing
 
08:28:59.208 --> 08:28:59.218 align:start position:0%
Resources even at full Staffing with our
 
08:29:02.388 --> 08:29:02.398 align:start position:0%
current number over allocated in terms
 
08:29:05.888 --> 08:29:05.898 align:start position:0%
of judges and staff we are substantially
 
08:29:10.368 --> 08:29:10.378 align:start position:0%
down in terms of their capacity to move
 
08:29:12.468 --> 08:29:12.478 align:start position:0%
the entire caseload that is before the
 
08:29:16.850 --> 08:29:16.860 align:start position:0%
circuit out which is it in in terms of
 
08:29:19.310 --> 08:29:19.320 align:start position:0%
Judges the numbers are roughly if you
 
08:29:21.730 --> 08:29:21.740 align:start position:0%
convert a judge into a day
 
08:29:26.388 --> 08:29:26.398 align:start position:0%
there are roughly 10 000 session days
 
08:29:28.070 --> 08:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
currently available if you have the
 
08:29:29.690 --> 08:29:29.700 align:start position:0%
total number of judges and the total
 
08:29:33.590 --> 08:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
number of days they sit we need about 16
 
08:29:37.610 --> 08:29:37.620 align:start position:0%
000 session days and of the 10 000 and
 
08:29:39.288 --> 08:29:39.298 align:start position:0%
of those sixteen thousand about five
 
08:29:41.090 --> 08:29:41.100 align:start position:0%
thousand of are based on statutory
 
08:29:43.610 --> 08:29:43.620 align:start position:0%
deadlines I don't have the numbers for
 
08:29:44.868 --> 08:29:44.878 align:start position:0%
staff off the top of my head and I
 
08:29:47.750 --> 08:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
apologize for that but it is the reason
 
08:29:51.170 --> 08:29:51.180 align:start position:0%
why the chief is asking in his budget
 
08:29:54.288 --> 08:29:54.298 align:start position:0%
request for a substantial increase in
 
08:29:56.350 --> 08:29:56.360 align:start position:0%
Staffing throughout the circuit courts
 
08:29:59.330 --> 08:29:59.340 align:start position:0%
to be able to bring it up to a standard
 
08:30:02.510 --> 08:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
where we can meet current caseload what
 
08:30:04.968 --> 08:30:04.978 align:start position:0%
this does is then takes what we studied
 
08:30:06.948 --> 08:30:06.958 align:start position:0%
in the in the weighted caseload study
 
08:30:09.590 --> 08:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
which was an evaluation of the workload
 
08:30:13.070 --> 08:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
at the time of that study and adds a new
 
08:30:15.650 --> 08:30:15.660 align:start position:0%
system into it that way to caseload
 
08:30:17.750 --> 08:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
study also did not take into account the
 
08:30:20.330 --> 08:30:20.340 align:start position:0%
repeal of felonies first because at the
 
08:30:21.948 --> 08:30:21.958 align:start position:0%
time of the study last year felonies
 
08:30:24.468 --> 08:30:24.478 align:start position:0%
first was still in place those felonies
 
08:30:26.570 --> 08:30:26.580 align:start position:0%
are now going to be before circuit court
 
08:30:29.388 --> 08:30:29.398 align:start position:0%
beginning January 1st that were not
 
08:30:36.288 --> 08:30:36.298 align:start position:0%
 
08:30:38.510 --> 08:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
08:30:40.910 --> 08:30:40.920 align:start position:0%
is there anybody else wishing to testify
 
08:30:43.368 --> 08:30:43.378 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 653 that is not turned in
 
08:30:44.750 --> 08:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
a pink card
 
08:30:46.670 --> 08:30:46.680 align:start position:0%
seeing none I will close the public
 
08:30:46.680 --> 08:30:48.288 align:start position:0%
seeing none I will close the public
hearing

08:30:48.288 --> 08:30:48.298 align:start position:0%
hearing
